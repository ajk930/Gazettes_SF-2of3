and found some gold coin. Captain Eoag
of that expedition disappeared. He prob

name of Keating. When Keating reached
Newfoundland he caxried on his person
gold and jewels" to the value- of Â£8000.
He was accused of murdering Captain
Boag and 'had a hard time to get out
of it.
In 1897 I received on the island a visit
from the second wife of Keating, from
whom I obtained all . the plans and
papers. All of the Chapelle papers were
obtained by me from Costa Rica, and all
the marks indicated and set forth there
\ in have been found and verified, and, of
course, are now known only to me. The

The rest of the crew were captured
"and were 'tried for piracy at Kingston,
Jamaica,- and -eighty-one ot the pirates
were banged on the yardaxm of the man
of-war. While they were in prison two
of. them, Thompson and .'Chapelle, who
had been forced to join the pirates
against their will, got away and swam
to a whaler in port. This whaler sailed
the same night, with Thompson and
Chapelle on board. These two men made
it up between them to keep everything
secret and made plans to obtain suffi
cient money wherewith to get a vessel to
return to Cocos Island. The two sur
vivors from the Relampago soon separ
ated and lost sight of each other.
After awhile each believed the other
dead and each organized an expedition,
\u25a0 Chapelle in England and Thompson in
Newfoundland. The English expedition
could not locate Cocos Island, and finally
their vessel was wrecked off the coast of
Costa Rica, and Chapelle left all his pa
pers and information there.
In the meantime the crew In Valparaiso
had captured another vessel and set sail
for the West Indies to get the treasure
themselves. When they were outside of
the port of Valparaiso they found that
they could not navigate the vessel. They
sighted another vessel, which turned out
to be a British man-of-war. The captain,
of this man-of-war, thinking the move
ments of the vessel suspicious, sent an
officer with some men on board to Inves
tigate. As -all the pirates told different
stories they were looked upon as such.
They were taken on board of the British
man-of-war and were taken to England
for trial, which resulted in their being
hanged. One of them turned King's evi
dence and offered to show where the
buried treasure was in the West Indies.
The English sent out the British man-of
war Magician, which found this island
and located â¢ some of the treasure.
While the \u25a0 British man-of-war was
anchored there, the Relampago. the
vessel of Captain Benito, came into the
harbor, shorthanded and .short pro
visioned. Before Benlto knew where he
â¢was he was right under the guns of the
man-of-war - Magician. Captain Benito
saw that resistance was useless and blew
out his brains.
Meantime the pirates had lost many of
their number in the various fights, and
the captain thought that that part of his
crew which he had left at Valparaiso
would return to the West Indies to ap
propriate the treasure. He made a pro
posal to the rest of the crew left on ths
island to return to the West Indies and
to i get the treasure left there, then re
turn to Cocos,- divide there and disband.
Some of hia crew, dissatisfied with this,
started a fight right on the island and
more than twenty men were killed then
and there. The survivors consented to
go with the captain to the West Indies
and carry out the plan.
The captain and two men burled a gold
crown, inlaid with priceless Jewels, and in
the same hole put a small cask of precious
stones. He then killed the two men who
helped do the work. However, the cap
tain was' watched by one" of the boys who

They sailed alongside of the galleon,

transferred -the treasure from the galleon
to. their own vessel, and then sunk the

on board, estimated at many millions, the
captain did not know of a suitable place
where it might be. lunded.

That is the way that August Giss
ler, Governor cf Cocos Island, repub
lic of Costa Rica, intends to welcome
anybody who is overcurious about his
treasure trove-
Let them try it, says he. He read
very recently that a company from
Victoria, B. C, was about to start out
â¢wrJth a capital of $10,000 to make Â«,
cearci. for the treasure. It was said
that the company had secured plans
cf the island from, the widow of a
Nova Scotia mariner who had founrl
the trÂ«asure once, but had been force.l
to leave it behind.
When the Governor of the island
read of this scheme he wTote excitedly
to the Consul General of Costa Hica
\u25a0wi-.c balds forth in San Francisco. Hj
wanted the Consul to take steps to
ctop the thing.
"Allow me to inform you," wrot-s
he, <: that no company with any such
intent would have the right even to
land on Cocos Island, as I hold a con
cession from the Costa Eican Govern
ment In regard to the said treasure,
and in which concession the Costa
liican Government has an interest.
Certainly anything that might be unÂ«
\u2666leriftken by such a company from
VictoTlc would amount to naught

was very much annoyed. He mny

GEORGIE'S PA EXPLAINS HOW
TO DEAL WITH ANARCHISTS
"What! Judging a man's character
from his methods of smoking a cigar?
Come, now, "Williaml"
*;'You may smile, sir," William went on
solemnly, "but I assure you there is a
good deal in It. Have you ever noticed
how Mr. B. treats a cigar once It Is
lighted?"
I admitted that I had not taken any no
tice of Mr. B.'s smoking habits.
"Well, sir, I have. He lights his $fgar,
takes a whiff or two and puts it down on
the tray. He may take another whiff and
he may not. The cigar remains on the
tray. I find it there, invariably, in tho^
shape of a cigar, but merely ashes from
tip to tip. It has burned away of its own
accord, slowly but surely."'
"Well, "William, and what does it sig
nify is the matter with Mr. B.?"
"Oh, simply absent-mindedness, sir, â¢'\u25a0
that's all. There are half a dozen mem
bers of this club who use cigars in an ex
actly similar fashion, and T assure you j
they are all absent-minded and forgetful."
"But, William, after all it is not a very
.wonderful discovery. The act you have
noticed is plain evidence or a man's fail
ing.".
"Just so, sir. But there are other points
where my theories are always correct.
For instance, if I may make so bold, I
think you. possess a very nervous tem
perament.. Look at that^cigar you have

sir, at the extranr<i! nar y wa y j n which

of them I have spent In this smokeroom,
and during that time I have met, as a ser
vant, several thousand gentlemen. I am
a thoughtful man, sir, and it has been my
delight to form certain theories as to the
effect of character on a gentleman's smok
ing style. I watch every new member's
method of smoking a cigar when first he
sits In this room. Afterward, when my
personal acquaintance - with him grows
more intimate, I assure you that I have
hever found my original estimate to be
wrong."

members of this club who treat a cigar 1
like that. They are all of a nervous tem- ;

"On the other hand," he went on, 'I I
can tell a strong-nerved man the moment j
he takes a cigar in his fingers. He In- j
variably uses the cutter further up than ]
most folks, and will not cease to smoke
It until It Is reduced to a rather longlsh
stumpâ which he takes in his fingers and
throws away.

"Mr. B., sir?' No, sir; he has not been

I looked at my watch again and uttered
a slight exclamation of annoyance.
"Excuse me, sir, but may I ask if there
was an appointment?"
I intimated that such was the case.
"He won't keep it, sir." William spoke
the words in a tone of such conviction
that I exclaimed:
"He has sent word, then?"
"No, sir, no; but I don't think you need
wait any longer. He won't come."
My patience was almost exhausted, but
I said calmly: "Tell me. William, if Mr.
B. has not sent word that he cannot meet
me, how do you know that he is not
coming?"
"I know it, sir," said William, most re

The work of each girl is selected to con
form to her ability to perform it. The
work is that which erpecially fits hex par
ticular requirement. The common ground
where all meet is on the "German tac
tics." After the running or marching ex
ercise all the frirls are expected to take
part in the drill, and then the remainder
of the time is eo.ually divided between
"free work" and "apparatus."
Jumping !s a popular exercise. Down
ward, upward and the long leap. Few
girls are able to run and jump any dis
tance, and when they do jump they near
ly jar their heads off. For a horizontal
leap she should start at a brisk pace, in
creasing as she nears the point froiri
which she is to spring, on reaching which
she must jump forward without a mo.
ment's pause, so- as to lose none of the
impulse of the run. One thing to be
avoided is any stiffness of the knees after
the jump. If the knees are stiff there is a
terrific jar, and it takes days to entirely
lose the unpleasantness. But if they are
bent and the body thrown â¢ backward
everything is smooth and easy. That is
the only way to deaden the shock caused
by the sudden weight of the body thrown
on the feet and the weight of the spring
Most of the girls can jump neatly and
gracefully, and a number of them ars
quite proficient in it. ' .
The parallel bars are just about the
best thing going to develop the wrists
and arms. When the body is held in. an
upright position by the strength of the
arms all the muscles are brought inro
active play, a fact that many of the glrl3

larger and firmer, but, nevertheless, that
fact has been ascertained after several
years of diligent practice and patience.
For patience alone will do it.
Climbing the ladder, head first or feet

afraid of a rush of blood to the head.
They go up and down that ladder stand

is. It is easy to go up one side Just as
one would climb an ordinary step-ladder,

It is more common to land there feet

At Â«-nc time everything was Kipling and
iwtbias but Kipling.
Now. if you ask any ore if he has read
"â¢Kirn." IZiplirgr's latest that has been
nn<nlns serially in McClure's. the general
reply is. "Yes. I commenced it and read
two cr three number;:. It was too dry,
I dropped it."
And yet "Kira" Is Kipling. There is all
the old povrer. aH the keen discernment,
ail the earzr.aiks of his best prose efforts
in this, his latest work.
On the cover cf the new book the pub-
Ilgherij "with true publisher's care in such
rr alters, have caused to be inscribed:
*â¢ 'If KIplins should die now his future
ff.rr.c would rest -upon the authorship of
'Kira.'â Sidney Colvin."
All cf which is very wisely said.
Some years ago Curing the Kipling boom
"Kim" would have made the same pop
i-'.ar hit as others of his books have done,
but new with the Kipling fad on the wane
it i.Â»; doubtful whether the general reader
r.-i'I ever get past those t?.o or three in-
Etailmenta that appeared in McClure's.
Kipling* hope for fame from "Kim"
certainly rests In the future.
In a way it is too bad. "Kim" is of
worth, just as much worth as any of Kip
ling's prose.
A serial appearance is enough to kill
the best of stories. Only the tale of the
detective type with "the hero poised in
n.'o-ir and the villain hacking at the rope
with a broken file' will stand the wet
U.tiiket of "Continued Next Month." So
it really" is toÂ» bad that "Kim" did not
appear in book form firstâ and then never
as e. serial.
To the readers who fell in the serial dis
aster all that can be said Isâ give Kipling
a'nother chance for auld lang syne and try
the bock.
The same general criticism applies to
"Kim" that geems to be merited by-Kip
ling's work in general. He la a destroyer
and not a creator. With the exception of
possibly an Englishman or two who float
through in a hazy sort of way there is
not a character that you would like to
bring home for dinner or introduce to
your nearest and dearest. "Kim" himself
ie as interesting a gamin as you could
wish to meet just because Mr. Kipling, by
his magnetic power, makes hlra seem that
way. But when you stop to analyze the
character you find that after all his lights
are the lights of the Oriental and, worss
than that, the Oriental trained for the se
cret service of India.
You draw the veil of Kipling glamour
aside and "Kim" stands forth as the son
of a one-tiir.e C3lor sergeant who died of
opium. You Eee "Kim" as he really isâ
a sharp weasel of a street urchin, wise
In worldly ways, with the two redeeming
features of. loyalty to the old lama, *who
is seeking the River of the Arrow, aud
devotion to the hand that has paid him
for sei vices rendered. You see him devel
op Into a young man who will prove a
ready and able toof for the secret serv
ice; a- man wise in every trick of his trade
and absolutely unscrupulous of means so
that the end of serving the "Great Game"
may be accomplished. That is "Kim" as
he really is when you have finished the
book and think the whole matter out.
Still that* is a criticism that applies in
a general way to nearly all of Kipllqg 8
prose.
He is certainly a master hand at de
picting as they really are drunken soldiers
and cunning- Orientals. "Kim" is no ex-'
ception. It is built flpon exactly the same
plan as those writings that made Kipling
an idol, so it should not be held up to
break him.
As a wondeiful and strong picture of
Indian life, people and departmental in
trigues "Kim" is a masterpiece; as a
story Ihat holds its readers by the power
cf its narrative it Is a failure.
Kipling educates Kim to the point where
he may really do something of interest
something worln while, even if it Is* in the
wrong direction, and then he abruptlv
closes the tale.
â¢ It looks to the casual observer as if
Kipling has purposely cut his story that
he may at somo later day give us a sequel
to "Kim." All of which Is very well for
the next book, but rather aggravating in
the case of this one.
Tfae present story of "Kim" run:Â»
through three phasesâ first, with Kim a*s
he is introduced to the reader, a little bov
seated astride rf the jjun Zam-Zammea"i
near the Lahore museum, meeting the oil
Jama, a pilgrim in the footsteps of Bur!
dha; second, as a schoolboy at St. Xn
vier's, trying to learn the wisdom of thu
Sahibs; third, us the budding secret ser*
vice man.
The book is equally interesting in a'l
three of its phases, for tach and every
one cf them is India through the eyes
of the Crieril.il, and not those of thj
casual visitor. \u25a0\u25a0 â¢â¢..''

Kim has a prize of his own that he Is
trying: to find. â¢
His father in his opium dreams dwelt
upon the fact that a red bull on a gree'j
bscksround should prove the fortune of
his senâ meaning, of course, . the flag oi
his own regiment. To the boy, brought
up by a half-caste woman, such matters
have been impressed on his mind as so
much magic, for of course he does not
understand the purport of his father'
regimental papers that hang in the amu
let around his n'jek.
By chance Kim and his lama happen t>
run risht into the old regiment of hj?
father. Kim has recognized the flag with
tho red bull on the green background,
and is doing a little spying to find hU
fortune when ne is seized by the regi
mental pastor for a thief. A search fo'.-
Iowe, and through the papers on Kim's
neck he is recognized as the son of the
old color sergeant, Kirnball O'Hara.
Although tha lama makes his pilgrim
age* as a beggar, still he is really a rich
man, and though it almost breaks his old
heart to give up his" devoted chela he In
sists that Kim shall go, as the English
men wish, and study in the schools; more
over, the lama insists upon paying for hi3
tuition.
"Kim" has already proved himself an
apt pupil in the "Great Game," as spying
in the secret service of India is called, and
has won for his friend a certain horse
dealer, Mahbub All,, whose service num
ber is "C 25." The horse dealer enlists
the sympathy and help of his superior,
Colonel Crcighton, who, in a short time,
is as Interested in the future of "Kim" as
are his Indian friends.
Every holiday "Kira" is either allowed
free rein of else Is educated more par
ticularly and directly in the intricacies of
the "Great Game." He finally becomes so
expert and trustworthy that he even
serves with come others of the gentlemen
of the service, 'who' appear on the register
merely under a letter and a number.
The most notable of these excursions is
the last adventure in the book, where
"Kim" and Hurree Babu outwit with true
Oriental cunning a Frenchman and a Rus
sian, who have come into the hill country
ostensibly to shoot goats, but really to
make surveys and pave the way for the
enemy..
Beyond a little bit of passing sentiment
between "Kim" and the woman of Sham
legh there is nothing of a love story. The
absolute and lasting devotion of "Kim" to
his old friend the lama is beautifully
drawn,, however, and more than compen
sates for the lack -of that romance of
strong men and lovely women . that is
made the whole stock in trade in nearly
every modern ftctlDn. Old fat and "fear
ful" Hurree Babu, with hi3 longing to
eventually become a Fellow of the Royal
Society, is a splendid bit of - character
work and makes a perfect type to illus
trate the odd and wondrous effect of Eu
ropean teaching on an Oriental nature.
* In fact, every one of the Indian charac
ters that figure in the book Is perfect
as only Kipling can make them.
It seems unfortunate. In a .way, that the
Kipling fad is on the wane; and yet it is
all for the best, for "Kim" will be read
only by those who can appreciate and not
by those who read merely to say, "I have
read it and isn't it simply splendid."

Literary Notes.
The Affirmative Intellect.
: "American citizenship is not a privilege;
It is a.propagandum." \u25a0 ' .^^ \u25a0':
This quotation from his latest booK.
"The Affirmative Intellect," sums up the
working cieed, religious as well as social,
of tho author. Charles Ferguson, who as
by a bugle blast aroused the thinKing
world a short time ago with the profound
and virile philosophy of his "Religion or
Democracy." :."
In his present work he proclaims his
evangel in stilt clearer and more positive
tones. He preaches that the kingdom of
heaven is at hand. His philosophy deals
not with the dead past, but with the puls
ing pres'ent and the future.
And so -he studies creative forces. The
primal and spiritual impulse he finds In
faith-the faith of the affirmative intellect.
Its outward manifestations he sees in
embryo In throe social organismsâ the
church, the political party and the uni
versity. The positive organisation of so
ciety, he believes, will consist in a blend-
Ing of the threeâ the church dedogma

The Kidnaped' Millionaires.
. "The Kidnaped Millioniiirts." by Fred
erick U. Adams, is a radical and pleasing
departure from .that prevalent fiction
which carries its followers back into ages
with which they are not familiar. Mr.
Adams contends that the present is the
most interesting, thrilling and romantic
period this world has ever, known... â¢
As the title indicates, the story is that
of the kidnaping. of certain modern mil
lionaires. Those who read Mr. Adams' en
tertaining story will not charge that his
plot is borrowed from the tales of.l'i'j
Foe, Reade'or Stevenson. The charm of
the story consists in the impressive
probability cf a plot which at first glance
would seem impossible. By a natural
chain of events there jsÂ» evolved a situa

Nelson the Newsboy.
"Nelson the Newsboy," by Horatio
Alger Jr., and completed by Arthur M.
Winfield; is a boys' tale relating the ad
ventures of a wide-awake lad in the great
metropolis. The youth is of unknown
parentage and Is thrown out upon his own
resources at a tender age. He becomes
at first a newsboy, and from that gradual
ly works up to something better. He is
often , tempted to do wrong â the tempta
tion becoming Â£ particularly hard on ac
count of his extreme \u25a0 povertyâ but there
Is that in 'his make-up which keeps him
in the right path, and in the end. he be
comes a victor in more ways ; than one.
In its original form Mr. Alger intended
this story of New York life for a semi

that shape,, and when the gifted' author

people had laid aside his pen forever this

written especially for this book. These

sparkle and wit that characterize all of

salient humor that > will doubtless make
them as popular as the first dialogues.

- ; ; San Francisco. ' .r> T would seem that riches and regal
jl power do not ajways go together; at
li any rate there are several monarchs
in receipt of salaries which the aver
age city clerk would despise.
The King of Portugal is probably the
poorest paid sovereign In Europe. He Is
supposed to receive $400,000 a year, but it
is alleged It Is some time since he received
anything at all, because money Is uncom
monly "tight" In the national exchequer.
Many of the royal dependents pay their
tradesmen with credit notes, but no doubt
in the future, when Portugal by practic
ing the strictest economy rights herself,
they will be -above par.
The Sultan is a rich man, but his posi
tion 1:5 not responsible for his wealth.
Were :.t not that he has enormous private
means he could not rule over Turkey ..be
cause some years have now elapsed since
he drew even a portion of his salary, al
though the Turks boast that he is paid at
the rale of about $4,000,000 per annum for
occupying the .throne. .This Is trueâ on
paper, but in reality Abdul Hamld gives
his services for nothing owing to the
bankrupt condition of his country.
Eleven dollars and a quarter a week Is
the munificent salary of the King of Sa
moa. The Berlin general act of 1SS9
brought this once powerful monarch face
to face with poverty, and settled the al
lowance mentioned upon ( h!m In lieu of
the thousands ha formerly played with.
The most humiliating fact, however, is
that his Chief Justice receives $6000 and
his President of Council $5000 a year,
while his most insignificant subject has
en Income little below his own. *
Until quite recently the King of Daho-

mey received the equivalent of $5 a week
from the French Government to / enable
him to live in exile at Martinique. But
eventually he appealed for an increase in
salary in order to maintain â¢ a larger re
tinue, with the result that he was grant
ed an additional 5 francs. After all, $3 a
week is not an exorbitant allowance for
the man who was once the most power
ful monarch in West Africa, t
The privilege of being King of Luxem
bourg is not an enviable one from a finan
cial point of view at any rate, for al
though the salary accruing to the post Is
supposed to be $75,000 a year there is often
difficulty in collecting as many hundreds.
The whole kingdom only extends over an
area of 1G00 square miles, defended by an
army of 250 men. The inhabitants pay
taxes when they choose to do so, but di
rectly the Government becomes unpopular
the country refuses to support it, and the
soldiers, whose pay is months and not in
frequently years overdue, side with the
people. At such times the, King has to
give his country credit, and at others
findsMt difficult to secure funds necessary
to uphold the dignity of a. throne.
The unfortunate Emperor Kwang Su of
China is supposed to be able to live with
out money; at all events his Government
does riot provIJe him with a penny. There
is" absolutely no grant to the reigning
monarch of China, but the Emperor has
the privilege of being able to order any
goods he may require and will not be

applies to the Dowager Empress, but she

So you see the cost of the outfit varies

all these things are not necessarily bought

season of hard plays without bains
bruised or twisted in some fashion. And
so it goes. From one seasdn to another
the things are gradually added until ther6
is nothing more to buy. The mere cost of
the necessary clothing is by no means all.
Expenses are forever bobbing up. To be
sure many of them are directly connected
with the game and then again many of
them are not, but that follows as a con
sequence.
The headgear is j the queerest looking

, Another useful Dut terribly homely ar
ticle is the nose guard. Of all the numer
ous football acquisitions this is the most
disfiguring. A large, broad piece of hard
rubber that broadens out near the mouth
and that Is necessarily narrow between
the eyes, gives any face an awfully hard
expression.' The. rubber is held with s the
teeth and there are three little holes that
\u25a0upply the air. "When the game Is a nard
one and everybody is doing his level best
either one of two things happens â the rub

player pants for. air, and needless to say
neither one helps the game out much.

The piece that holds it firmly to the head
fits like a cap and is fastened to the other
ones by small rivets. From either side
are suspended round pieces with tiny
openings that fit over the ears, and from
these two flaps are two elastics, one that
fits over the chin and another that fits
under it. *
The entire affair is firm and when on
most curiqus and Interesting. While
its commercial uses are beyond the com
prehension of the needs ofj the Persian,

each of them~ is fascinated by an inven

music. Captain J. TV. "Webster of tha

Crbnje to St. Helena, amused the old hero

Webster; telling the story, goes on: *' 'Yes,

was f unrw to see him. When the music
had ceased a black Kaffir boy ser

awesomely that there was a devil in the

expressive gesture with hi3 lips. To sat

None of the football paraphernalia is
much, for beauty, and the players gener

they have literally wallowed in mud on
several occasions. If a chap's own mother
met him after dark she would run like a
whitehead, and nothing could persuade
her that a son of hers could look so like a
cutthroat. But all this goes toward mak
ing a player attractive, sought after and
a veritable hero.
The shoes of a football player look
three times heavier than those of an or
dinary chap. If they were " higher they
would serve admirably for hunting boots,
for a time, but the rubber would soon
wear off. Directly -over the ankle bone
an extra piece of leather is inserted. That
is for two reasonsâ strength and thick
ness. The soles are heavy but are hand
sewed and soft. To prevent sliding there
are" six or seven rubber pieces that stand
up like so many spikes, both on the solo
and the heel. ' \u25a0
When, the ankles and wrists are incased'

a red mark as a reminder, for a rubber
band encircles the brow and holds the
top of the guard in place.
The shin guards are not dreams of
beauty, but they cover that part of the
body that gets the hardest, the meanest
and the most frequent blows and kicks.
Everybody will readily remember the days
when his shins were perpetually bound
in turpentine and bacon, as the result of
stealing the neighbors' apples, so tha

announcement cf a Salon experience.

The painting is brilliant with action,
with exdtement that is as much sup

of the Old Guard stands out, the scarred
battleground for its relief. The doubt of
the soldiers as their lire is halted: the
mad courage of the hero; these- can be felt
in the vt:.- air.
"The Su. tan's Guard" is a treasure
brought by Morris from the Salon. It is
a canvas whoso value bears no relation

only, calm endurance, acceptance of her
lot.
The country is fresh and beautiful, the

lazy summer and lovers' rambles. There
is a subtle contrast between this back

Holland blood and fiery Boer sympathies.
The Boer war ought to mean much to him
and his art and it doubtless will prove to.
The head is a daring, piece of
executed with the bold originality that
has characterized that, great v school of
Dutch painters all these long years.

There are now some gems by local artists
âgems as yet unset by popular acclaim.
Just now the local galleries are ex
hibiting a number of good things that
are worth the looking at. Gump has sev
eral wanderers In the way of paintings
that have found their way here from thÂ«
last Salcn and are being newly exhibited
In San Francisco. William Morris has
some lecal work to show that may yet
win fame for Californians.
The painting chows, how; an old theme
can be. made new. Far from original In
conception, still the painting reached the
high-water mark at the last Salon. It is
an old, old theme, in fact,, but one that
will bear many and divers brushes. The
contrasts. direct, unconcealed; the con
ception treatment are simple; the
picture is human. ;It. is one to reach the
hearts*of men and women, rather than to
dazzle by : its brilliancy.. ' "~ \u25a0 .

comparison with that of the old herb
gatherer. It Is the old fagot woman sit

pears hereâ the figure . of a young and
lovely girl. The ' contrast of youth and
age has given rise to the popular name

French people were calling the picture

The picture Is called i "An* Incident of
the Frontier." And a very thrilling inci
dent it is, as well as true to life. A stage
is dashing down the .dusty road pursued
hot and close by a band of Indians. The
furious speed of the horses, the excited
lashing of them by the driver, the swift
pursuit, all give action that thrills at a
glance. Hansen knows the country, too.
In this as well as his other work there,
is the glittering sunlight of the desertâ
the sunlight that sketches shadows black
and sharp. The atmosphere "feels hot.".
The horses in this work are studies, in
thomselves. Hansen makes a specialty of
his Western horses and all of them show
the hard 'life that they lead, the strength
and . stubborn endurance that often lie
hidden under a weary aspect but that are
ever ready for the j emergencies of their
life, such as an Indian pursuit. One small
study is of- a pinto," a staid-looking old
fellow, but_a fellow that Mr. Hansen says
'â¢only" wants a little provocation to show
what real bucking is." ; .
I In Morris' gallery the calcium Is just
now upon a painting by Hansen, that Ger
man who is teaching us things about our
own American frontier. It is rather a
bitter pill to swallowâ the fact that he

as well gulp it down and be graceful
about it. ' â¢ \u25a0 . . \u25a0

'\u25a0 The painting represents a corner under
Moorish ar*ches where a little group sit
listening to a chief recounting his > ex

the greatest interest in the exploits. A
child near by is idly playing with a bird
on its hand, " evidently ceasing to listen
to the "grown-up" talk.

Matilda Lotz is - a Californian whose
work is growing day by day. She is espc
â¢cially successful in her animal studies, al
. though Â£he by no means confines herself
to them, and her painting called "Medita
tion" \u25a0 is one of these. It shows- a fox
hound, a deer hound and a skye terrier all
apparently in solemn conclave just as we
have seen dogs many a time"* when they
seeired to be bent upon serious problems.
Miss Lotz is partly a Californien, for
she moved here from Tennessee when she
was still very small and when her career
was not yet. decided upon. It was here
that : she received her _ first inspirations
which she has since taken to Paris. It was
here, too, that she achieved some measure
'of her success, for she won the Alvord
gold medal. But Paris is her home now;
. from there she occasionally crosses the
to its reputation. It Is of local value, be

At 1 o'clock, faultlessly attired, he de

a summary* dismissal, bowed low. He
waited until the strange trio entered ,the
elevator and then sauntered downstairs,,
his hands in his pockets, his heart as light
as air. Unconsciously he jingled. the coins.
A broad smile came over, his face as he
drew forth a certain piece. Holding it

grace the gilded throne."

smile so Intoxicating that he felt himself
the most favored of men. He saw that
smile in his mind's eye for months after
ward, that, maddening sparkle of Joy,
which flashed from her eyes to the very
bottom of his heart, there to snuggle for

this fascinating dream. . More than once

find bleak unhappiness where exquisite
joy had reigned so gloriously. As it drew
to an end a sense of depression came over
him. An hour at most was- all that he
could have with her. Nine o'clock was
"drawing "nigh -with its regrets, Its long-
Ings, , its desolation. - : He determined to
retain the pleasures of the present until,
amid the clanging of bells and the roll
of car wheels, the dismal future began.
His intention to accompany them to the
station was expressed as they were leav-
"Yes. And' will you 'dine with us^ this
evening?" Her Invitation was so. unax

that he looked askance, . "Ach, you must

he could detect the blush that : returng
with the recollection of a reprimand.
"Yoir should prorit by what J have been

"Your kind' offices shall never" be for

Lorry was weighing in his mind the ad
visability of asking them to dine in the
evening with his mother, but two objec
tions presented themselves readily. Flrat,
he was afraid of this perverse maid; sec
ond, he had not seen his mother. In fac:,
he did' not know that she was in town.
"At 2.' o'clock, 'I fancy. You leave, at 5
to-night, do you not?"
Mr. and Mrs. Guggenslocker stared in
a bewildered sort of manner- at:. their
niece. Then Aunt Yvonne turned ques
tioning eyes toward her husband," who
promptly bowed low before the tall
American and said:. ' .
"You make me happy again," he said,
softly, as they drew near the elder mem
bers of the party, who had paused* t<j
wait for. them. "I shall ask your uncle
and aunt to accompany us."/.

will take me for .the drive, I. shall be
delighted and more than grateful."

such an appeal? "I beg for the first time

did she mean by that? ,

a thrill in his voice.

morning paper. There was nothing iu

pages, not one thingâ but wait! A
thought struck him suddenly, and tor
ten minutes he searched the columns ts
siduously, even nervously. J Then he
threw down the paper with a sigh of ru
llef. \u25a0 â¢
There was nothing to Indicate that her
train had been wrecked. She had un
doubtedly reached New York In safety.
He lrfoked at his watch. She was proba
bly enjoying her breakfast at that mo
ment. Perhaps she was thinking of him,
andâ perhaps not. â¢ . â¢
If Lorry slept that night he was not
aware of It. The next morning, after lie
had breakfasted with his mother, he trteÂ«l
in vain to recall a minute of the time be
tween midnight and eight a. nl. in which
he did not think of the young woman
who had flown away with his tranquillty.
All night long he tossed and . thought.
He counted ten thousand black sheep
jumping over a pasture fence, but after
the task was done and the sheep ha>l
scattered, he was as far from sleep as
ever. Her face was everywhere. Her
voice filled his ear with music never-ceas
ing, but It was not, the lulling music that
invites drowsiness. He heard the clock
strike the hours from 1 to 8, when he
arose, thoroughly disgusted with hlmaslf.
Everything seemed to taste bitter or to
look .blue. That breakfast was a grea:
strain on his natural politeness. He wor
shiped his mother, but in several in
stances that morning he caught himself
just In time to prevent the utterance of.
some sharp rejoinder to her pleasant,
motherly queries. Twice she was com
pelled to repeat questions, his mind be
ing so far away that he heard nothing:
save words that another woman had ut
tered, say twenty-four hour3 before. HIa
eyes were red,' and there was a heavy
droop to the lids; his tones were drawling
and his voice strangely without warmth;
his face was white and tired.
"You are not well, Grenfall," his
mother said, peering anxiously into hia
eyes. "The trip has done you up. Now,
you must take a good, long rest and ; re
cover from your vacation." . . .
He smiled grimly.
"A man never needs a rest so much a,*
he ,does at the end of his vacation, cb,
mother? Well, work will be restfuL . ,1
shall go to the office this morning and do
three days' work before night. That wtil
prove'to you that I am perfectly well."
Vâ SENTIMENTAL EXCHANGE.
A white hand fluttered before his eyes,
and she was gone. He stood, hat in hand,
watching the two red lights at the end of
the train until they were lost in the night.
A startled, expression flashed across her
face, and her lips parted as If in protes
tation. As she leaned forward, holding
stoutly to the hand-rail, there was no
smile on her countenance.
"You must come to Edelweiss to see
me. I shall expect you!" He thought there
was a challenge in the tones. Or was it
mockery?
'.'I will, by heaven, I will!" he ex
claimed.
As he swung out; ready to- drop to the
ground, she-said, her eyes sparkling with
something that suggested mischief, her
face more bewitching than ever under the
flicker of the great arc lights:
"I have, indeed, for you saw me before
I saw you. I am. glad I have not changed
for the worse In your eyes."
"As .1 first knew you with my eyes, I
will say that they are trustworthy," sho
said tantalizingly.
"I do not mean that I have changed ex
ternally." \ %
"In any other case my eyes would not
serve," she .cried with mock disappoint
ment. "Still," she added, sweepingly.
"you are my ideal American. Good-by!
The man has called 'all .â¢ " oard" " :
"Good-by!" he said, swinging up on the
narrow step beside her. Asrain he clasped
her band as she drew back in surprise.
"You are going out of my land, but not
out of my mind. If you wish your eyes to
see the change In me, you have only to
look at them In . a mirror. They are tha
hope that I may see you agaln." -
She hesitated an instant, her eyes wa
vering beneath his. The train was mov
ing slowly now. Â»
"I pray that. we may meet." she said,
softly, at lastâ so softly that he barely
heard the words. Had she uttered no
sound he could have been sure of her re
sponse, for It was in her telltale eyes.
His blood . leaped madly. "You will be
hurt if you wait until the train Is running
at full speed," she cried, suddenly return
ing to the abandoned merry mood. She
pushed him gently in her excitement.
"Don't you see how rapidly we are mov
ing? Please go!" There was a terror In
her eyes that pleased him.
"Good-by, then!" he cried.
"Adieu, my American!" she cried,
quickly. . â¢ â¢
"Not as I have been since?" he cried.
'-'Have you changed since I first saw
you?" she asked quaintly. .
"You are mistaken. Why should I for
get youâ ever? Are you not the ideal
American whose name I bought? I shall
always remember you as I saw yoyâ at
Denver." . â¢ '
She drew her hand away gently, but did
not take her eyes away from his upturned
face.
"I shall never forget the past few days,"
he said, a thrill in his voice. "Ycu have
put something into my life that can. never
be taken away. You will forget me be
fore you are out of "Washington, but Iâ I
shall always see you as you are now."
"And now it Is good-by forever. I am
so sorry that I have not seen more of
you." she said. He took her hand and
.held It tightly for a moment.
"Or I can assist her," Lorry hastened,
to add, giving her a grateful look which
she could not misunderstand. The uncle
shook hands warmly with the youns man
and passed up the steps. She was follow
ing when Lorry cried:
"Will you not allow me?"
She laughingly turned to him from the
steps and stretched forth her hand.
The tall, soldierly old gentleman was
waiting to assist his niece into the coach.
"Go first. Uncle Caspar," the girl made
Lorry happy by saying, "I can easily
come up unaided."
"It 13 nine o'clock. Perhaps you would
better get aboard," he said, and pro
ceeded to assist Aunt Yvonne up the
steps. She turned and pressed his hand
gently before passing Into the car.

and dlsjointedly from his lips: ;
"You Will let me go to the station with

She raised her eyebrows slightly, but
thanked him and said she would consider
it an honor. His face grew hot and hl3
heart cold with the fancv that there wa?
ln-her eyes a gleam which said: "I pity
you, poor fellow.." \u25a0.-.-!; \
Notwithstanding his strange misgiving
and the fact that his pride had sustained
quite a perceptible shock, he drove with*
them to the station. They went to the
sleeping car a few minutes before the
time set for the train's , departure, and
stood at the bottom of the steps, utter-
Ing the good-bys, the godspeeds and* the
sincere hope that they might meet again.
Then came the sharp activity of the train
men, the hurry of belated passengers. He
glanced soberly at his watch.

a month. Relieved of his'iinpedlrr.enta. he
returned to the station.
"Good moraine. Mr. Lorry. Are you In
too much of a hurry to see your friends?"
cried a < lear. musical voice, and he
rtoppod as if shot. The anxious frown
â¢ fiew from h:s= brow and \u25a0was succeeded in-
Etantantously by' a glad smile. He
wheeled and beheld her. with Aunt Yvon

c>:c;;iiffi<'d. extending bis hand gladly. To
bis amazement she drew herself up
rsujrhtily ar.d ignored the proffered hand.
Only for a brief second did this strange
and uncilled-for hauteur obtain. A bright
rmiie crept over her face and her repent
art fingers sought his timidly, even awk
wardly. Something told him that she was
not accustomed to handshaking; that
Fomethi:ig impelled him to bend low and
touch the gloved fingers with h!s Tps. He
straightened, with face f.ushed, half fear
ful lest his act had been observed by
turious? loungers, and he had taken a lib
erty in a public place which could not be
condoned. But she smiled serenely, ap
provingly. There was not the fa'.ntest
s-ipn of cmlwrrufsinetit or confusion In the
lovely face. Any other girl In the world,
he thought, would have jerked her hand
away and giggled Curiously. Aunt
Yvonne inclined her head slightly, but did
not proper her hand. He wisely refra'.ned
from extending his own. "I thought you
hud left the station." he said.

""I ha 3 hoped you might stay over for a

"It is: urgent business that compels us
to leave so hastily. Mr. Lorry. Of all the
cities in the world, I have most desired to
see the capital of your country. Perhaps
1 may return some day. But do not let
us detain you if you are in a hurry."
He started, looked guilty, stammered
something aboat baggage, said -he would
return in a moment and rushed aimlessly
away, his ears fiery.
"I'm all kinds of a fool." he muttered,
as he raced around the baggage-room
nnd then back to where he had left the
Indies. Mr. Guggenslocker had joined

Miss Gujrgenslccker's face expressed
pleasure at seeing him.

watch: The old gentleman greeted him ;
warmly, and Lorry asked .them -to what
hotel they were poir.g. On being informed
that they expected to spend the day at the
Kbbitt he volunteered to accompany them,
raying: that he intended, -to breakfast^
there. Quicker than a flash a glance, un
fathomable as it was brief, passed be
tween the three, not quickly enough,
however, to escape hf5' keen, watchful
Â»Â»yes. on the alÂ«rt since the beginning of
hi? acquaintance with them. In conjunc

that mipht satisfy. In a measure, his
burning curiosity. What was the mean-
Ing of that glance? It half-angered him.
for in it he thought he could distingu'sh
riroysnce. apprehension, disrray or some
thing equally disquieting. Before he could
stiffen his long frame and give vent to the
d'ernified reconsideration that flew to his
mind the young lady dispelled all pain

tures, by saying:
"How good of you! "We shall be so o>

her if she would not drive wjth him.
His ardent gallantry met with a sur
prising rebuke. The conversation up to
that moment had been bright and cheery,
her face had been the constant reflector
cf his own good spirits, and he had every
reason in the world to feel that his sug
gestion would be received with pleasure.
It was a shock to him. therefore, to seÂ«
the friendly smile fade from her eyes and
a <iif-dainful gleam succeed it. Her voice*
a nicmontago sweet and affable, changed
its tone instantly to one so proud and at
rogant tliat he could scarcely believe nis

"1 shall be engaged during the entire
day. Mr. Lorry," she said, slowly, look
ing him fairly in the eyes with cruel posl

with surprise and the glowing gleam of
injured pride. His lips closed tightly; III
tie red spots flew to his cheeks and then
disappeared. leaving his face white and
cold : his heart throbbed painfully wiih
the mingled emotions of shame and

that very reason, she, has jumped upon it
herself and I have -been' able to^photo
graph her without her dreaming that any
thing was going on. However, this Is luck
and cannot be counted upon.
I want to take her picture in an alert

work. J*iturally I must find out what will

That is why I never try to place her
upon the stool until I am ready.. It would
be of no use. She would jump down imme

If she suspects that any one is trying to

That is an Important point. She must
not feel excitement in the air, and she
must not discover that something Js to be
done in which she is to be the chief par
ticipant.
After she has become used to xnypres

as quickly as dors <io. and tnoy realize
that -although anybody may stroke their
backs, it is only the initiated who know
the potent trick of scratching them gently
on the slue of the neck. "'This always
raises me several per cent in pussy's es

That le no easy matter with most of
these Angora cats, for they art a.hlgh
etrung lot of animals, with nerves alert
end claws ever ready. I have gone about
with my hands in bandages sometimes
after spending an afternoon with one of
these mild-looking - fluff balls; but the
Bcratches don't count If I can only get
â¢the picture. It la enough of a feat to pay
\u25a0lor any amount of trouble and bandaging.
In tee first place I talk to the cat. play
'Kith It, do anything to win Its confidence.
Tou have got to know cats to do this
imceessfully. They recognlzs their friends
I begin by getting acquainted.
They are like people, only different.
As for character and personality, they
Jiave as much as any boy or girl or grown
person, fox the matter of that. As for
Etubbornness, arrogance, general cussed
riess, they have more. And as posers,
vhen you can get them to pose they have
raore grace than any actress who makes
e. study and a profession of the art.
But the getting them toâ that Is where
the whole trouble comes in.
They have the ways of a woman, who,
â¢when she will she will, and when she
won't she won't.
For the most part they won't.
When I take my camera to a house to
make studies of the family darling Us
jnlstrees usually says:
"Do try and get her In some of the
poses that she assumes naturally. She is
wo pretty at play."
And the minute pussy sees a strange
man and a strange machine she usually
r.ays "M-r-r-row." the translation of
\u25a0which is, "I don't know what all this is
about, but 1 don't approve of it anyway,
and I'm go,'.ng: to show my disapproval by
being as disagreeable as I possibly can."
Then Ishe skulks in a corner or goes to
isleep, determined to ignore the whole af-
J'air.
There 15 no way, of course, that a cam
era can follow a cat about and instan
taneously focus on her when she assumes
a charming and unconscious attitude. The
only way to get a picture other than a
dim snapshot is to make the cat sit still
in the allotted place, and this is the prob
lem of the -whole proposition.
Tou might think that the owner of the
cat would be of assistance in this, but as
a matter of fact I have always found it
easier to work alone. There Isn't a cat
living who wants to stay In any spot
where she Is placed either by a mistress
or a stranger. So as I have' to resort to
all kinds of subterfuge, I can work bet
ter If left alone In the room with the pet
than If one of the family stays around to
distract Its attention.
Now that the Cat Club Is a firmly or
ganized institution, cats of fancy breeds

cisco homes. I have taken photographs
cf many of these, and since I began the

- Jim, a white Angora that belongs to
Mrs. Brod, has a peculiar way of squint
ing his- eyes, giving the appearance of a
pleasant smile. This makes him an in
teresting poser, and I have had good suc
cess with him several times.
Cats won't "look pleasant" when they
are told to do so, much less smile, but
the white cat seated beside its little Ethi
opian brother on the bamboo stool certain
ly has its lips parted in a smile if ever
cat had. It was a dangling watch lob

It la amusing to see the affected expres
sions that some cats will take, with heail
tilted up like a French actress, or with
paw gracefully extended a3 If it was a

their fluffy tails about their feet as Bern

them in beautiful curves as a woman

WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â "In the
line of duty, while receiving
the people, was shot by Leon
F. Czolgosz," is v the official
statement filed with the sur
geon general of the navy by Dr. Presley
M. Rixey, Medical Inspector, U. S. N., us
the introduction for his report upon, the
wounding, illness and death of the late
President McKlnley. The cause of death
is thus stated: "Gangrene of. both walls
of the stomach and pancreas, following
gunshot wound."
The report itself is remarkable for Us
exhibition in the closest possible detail of
the exact-state of the patient during Ins
mortal illness. It is in the shape of a
ship's log, almost, showing at intervals
of a very few minutes, sometimeE a single
minute, rarely more than an hour, the
patient's progress toward the end. But
perhaps the most valuable data contained
from a medical point of view is. the ac
curate registering of the medication of
the caseâ not a single morsel of food nor a
dose of medicine or bath ls omitted in this
account., fcicluded in the running story
at the proAr intervals are the bulletins
which" were given to the public as the
case progressed. .
' The -report begins with an account of
the first operation at the Emergency Hos
pital September 6, the two wounds being
described exactly as they have been
treated in the preceding medical reports,
Dr. Rixey stating that all the physicians
present agreed to immediate laparotomy,
makes his first entry at 5:30 p. m.. whon
Dr. Mann made a vertical incision passing
through the wound, and found at the very
beginning a piece of cloth carried in by
the bullet. 'Eight minutes later strych
nine was administered hypodermlcally.
Some time after that brandy was admin
istered in the same manner and then mor
phine likewise was administered. This
same application became .necessary n> e
minutes .after the patient .-arrived at the
Milburn house the result being an im
proved pulse, but slight nausea.

HEART DISEASE.
Some Begarding ttte BÂ«pid In-,
. crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart troubles, at leapt, among the
Americans, are certainjy Increasing, and
while this may be largely due to the ex-
ckement and worry of American business
lite, it Is more often the result of weak
stomachs, of poor digestion.
Heal organic disease is incurable, but
not one case in a hundred of heart trouble
is organic. ...
The clOje relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nerves,
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way, also the heart is af-
fected by the form of poor digestion,
which causes gas and fermentation from'
half digested food. There is a feeling of
oppression and heaviness in the chest
caused by pressure of the distended
stomach on the heart and lungs. Interfer-
ing with their action, hence, arises pal-
pitation and short breath.
Poor digestion alsd poisons the blood,"
corking it thin and watery, which irri-
tr.tc-s and weakens the heart.
\u25a0 The most sensible treatment- for heart
trouble Is to Improve the digestion and to
insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This '-can be -done by the regular use
alter meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, which may'be found
at most drug stores, and which contain
valuable, harmless digestive elements In
a pleasant, convenient form.
It is safe to say that the regular, per-
eistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at meal time will cure any form of
stomach trouble except cancer of the
stomach.
Full sized package of ihese tablets sold
by druggists at 60 cents. Little book on
stomach troubles mailed free. Address F.

The speaker referred to Mr. Schmltz as

To tell- the truth Mr. Tobin is not only the

not quite as visionary, not quite Fas handsome,
perhaps, but he is equally fluent: in imputing

scarcely any ' worth ' appraising; but! Mr.'' Tobin
But the people are looking for : a man* of
sober sense, of mature Judgment, of executlve,
administrative ability, of business sagacity, \u25a0 of
large . experience and intimate â¢ acquaintance
with the condition of the cityâ her finances,
her needsâ and they find him in the person.'of
Asa R. Wells. â¢ â¢ - " \u25a0 \u25a0 . ' ââ¢;â¢\u25a0-
So you see a man may have many-accom

qualities, and yet not be an orator. \u25a0 To â¢ Ml
you the truth there are but a few of us left."
Who Is Aea R. Wells? One of the common
peopleâ honest, plain, straightforwardâ one who
has lived and labored I in your, midst . for forty
yearsâ the watchdog of the treasury. . -
Ah, but it ls said that Mr. Wells is no orator
â no orstor as Brutus is. I grieve to say that
to this charge be may have to plead ; guilty.
But what are we to do?- Not all men are or
can be orators. (Certainly no one I will accuse
Mr. Tobin of being an orator.).. The orator, it
is said, is something: like-, the poet â born," not
made. And who is it that* accuses Mr. Wells
of this heinous crime? My friend of 'the Chron

would hardly be classed with \u25a0 Cicero. -
And riKht here let me say that It does, not
become Mr. Tobin to reflect on the character
of Mr. Wells. Mr. Wells ls a pioneer of Cali

What, then, of platforms? The Republican
platform is sound and meets the- requirements
of such a document. It Indorses the magnifi

plores his untimely I death, demands punish

and errresses the hope that the governments
of the v. orld will unite In suppressing anarchy

in tne main body of the hall were vacant,

bowed to the audience. S. M. Shortridge,
the principal speaker of the evening, and
a number of candidates followed, taking
iheirrfKrisitions on the stage.
2Co time was lost In preliminaries. Chair
man Riordan said:
"I air. more than pleased at the attend
ance to-nigrht. Orators will tell you why we
desire a change in our municipal govern
ment. "We are compelled through per
sonal appeals to make our campaign, be
cause the time has passed when we can
appeal to you through the organs of our

the Democrats do? Why, they just got
out and advertised two meetings on the
same n:^ht in the same districts. That is
what we nave to contend with. I will in
trodnce Congressman Julius Kahn as
chairman of the evenine."
Mr. Kann was received with great ap
plause and spoke as follows:
Enthusiasm Not Bead.
Z eee Republican enthusiasm is not deal.
The mere fact that Republicans have turned
out to-right as they have Ehowa they have
determined to win. San Francisco Is at the
turning point of her commercial and maritime
career. The time is. not far distant when San
rranolsco will become the second maritime
power in the United States. Conditions indi
cate a population of 1,600,000 In a few years,
â¢without counting . Chinese or Japanese. The
coming Congress â¢will pass on many question!
of vital interests, and it will not be eaid that'
San FranciscQ has repudiated the Republican
ccminit: ration.
Congressman Kahn then Introduced
Samuel M. Shortridge aa the principal
speaker of the evening. Mr. Shortridge
spoke as follows:
My Fallow Citizens : It was eaid of the great
Lord Cliatham, the elder Pitt, by Macaulay,
that â¢ < He loved England as an Athenian loved
the City of the Violet Crown, as a Roman loved
the City of the Seven Hills."
But Athens in -all her eplendbr. Rome in all
1it grlory. was not to be compared with this
city of our homes and heartsâ city of our pride
and hoi>e â beautiful, hospitable, healtMul San
Francifcoo. In spite of recreant cons who have
scandalized her, in spite of envious rivals that
have disparaged her, she stands in regraj beauty
without a peer, the Xew York of the Pacific
Coast, the Paris of America.. And beet of all,
she is the banner Republican city of thl? ban

publican nation.
Because I love San Francisco I am here to
assist la rescuing her from Phelaniem and ail
the visionary things Phelanism stands for. I

bonic Bsard of Health that has wickedly placed
a blot on her hitherto fair and unpolluted

I am here to assltt in rescuing her, redeem

I am here to assist in preventing the perpet

great in prophecy, contemptible In fulfillment,
great ia little things, but Impotent to deal in
large affairs.
1 am proud to say that I was rocked in a Re
publican cradle â taught by a father -who loved
his country well and died with a smile upon
his lips; when told of a Republican \u25a0 victory â
that since I could stand I have walked under
the Republican banner. I walk- under that
banner to-night. And because I '"do.* and be
cause re is- an upright and incorruptible man.
a loyal and untraxnmeled Republican. I am
here to assist. If possible, 4n making more
certain the election of San Francisco's tried
and true and faithful sen-ant, Asa R. Wells. â¢
There is no occasion for. anger. In this
contest there Is no place for anger. Certainly
I feel none toward any citizen who may differ
from ire. Some men who have done me wrong
I have forgiven ; some who have reviled me I
have forgotten. We are fellow-citizens, we
should be friends. Our homes, our firesides
are here. Here are the graves where our
lo\-ed ones deep and here we shall lie down
to rest after life's battle is over.
Nor :.s Jt an occasion for slander or libel.
These are the weapons of maliceâ weapons
used by the vicious and debased.
Let slander shut its malignant lips: let libel
*tay Its poisonous hand â and for the good of
our morals and the peace of our souls give
the cartoonists a long, an indefinite vacation.
Hearts Sore With Grief.
\u25a0VTe have had enough of reckless, wicked,
traitorous attacks on character. We still walk
in the shadow of a great sorrow. Our hearts
are fctill sore with grief. Our eyes are scarcely
dry. The pulpit, the bench, .the heart of a
stricken nation have cried out aeainst the
crime, the eln. of wantonly misrepresenting
the life, the motives, the high and holy pur
pose cf him who guided us to prosperity in
peace and led uÂ« to dory In warâ the beloved
and martyrd William McICinley.
Yellow journalism staggers under the rebuff
and indignation of an outraged people. Let
not th06e who have laid on the lash imitate
the vicious example of the wretch they affect
to scorn. -
Ko, no; let reason have an Inning; let truth
have a chance. Let the press be fair and
just and truthful. If heaven has denied it
greatnsss it can at least be decent. - \u25a0
It \a eald with much emphasis by those who
peek to justify their desertion of a party that
has honored them that there is or should be
no pol.tics in municipal e!ectior.6. This I deny
I bellwe in party, not individual, autocratic
Koverr.ment. in city. State and nation. I think
It highly important for us as citizens that the
a/fairs of this municipality be conducted by
party menâ and by Republicans. Success in
this great city helps us to carry California next
fall. And carrying California next fall helps
to elect Theodore Roosevelt., in 1904.
Let Bourbon -Democracy lay aside Its mask
end c*ase to cmijure in the name of Abraham
Lincoln.

Said he: . '
I have suffered no change in any of the con

my return to the Republican party does violence
to none of those convictions. I am aa sincere

I have always acted with the . Republican
party upon every, question but stiver. I have
an unbroken record aa a protectionist. My vote
ln the Senate Committee on Finance enabled
the Dingley tariff bill to be reported and thus
saved the country from the woes of. Demcratic
tariff misrule. I believe in progress and" ex
pansion upon every line beneficial to Amer

that in the alignment of political parties to-day
the Republican party Is the only one which la

Continuing, the Senator said' that tho

judgment, of legislation by ' Congresa

that "the average American-is the least

Possibly there has been an increase of
knowledge. A bank ln one of our smaller
cities once charged nearly 4 per cent com
mission for transferring a sum of Ameri

that rcugh method of calculation whereby
< marks, or S francs, or 5 lire, are equal to
51, and S3 are equal to Â£1 sterling. This
method ia easy, but the inaccuracy, of it
is costly when it is applied to a sum of
several thousands of dollars. Possibly
American travelers are also beginning to

that ln Germany 80 marks are SO marks,
In the estimation of Germans, and not a
little more than $19, according to our

- Mr. : Chairman, toadies and -.Gentlemen: I
come before you to-night to make a statement.
I desire to say that I was nominated \u25a0 by the
Republican party and my election is being op
posed by the Morning Call and the Chronicle
because they < were not permitted to dominate
the -convention. I can assure you," my friends,
that I am beholden to no man, no set of men.
no corporation. I have not made a promise
to any - living soul. If I am elected Mayor I
can assure , you that I will ' be ,the Mayor of
the city and county of- San Francisco. ; (Ap
plau&e.) . . '.
I wish to. add a* word regarding-: franchises
and public utilities.' These are . great, momen
tous questions. No man is wise enough to say
Just what should be done in these cases. What
ever it is believed is the will of the people,
what the people may want when we reach these
questions I assure you they .will find a strong
friend and helping hand in me. - But lt seems,
my . friends, â¢ that the Mayor should: be above
these petty questions. I think that you should
take the Mayor somewhat on trust. The tree
is known by its fruit. I believe that I shall
be equal to those questions if they ever reach
me.- . â¢ ...\u25a0-\u25a0..--\u25a0'..-..\u25a0
hereafter. Is given: herewith in full:
I promised to conduct the business of the city
as far as my office was concerned, on business
m etnod J when I was a candidate two years
ago. .That this has been done, I leave to you
to judge. But I do npt take all the credit upon
myeelf. â¢ I ; have had . able ; assistants. . Some
people say why don"t you spend your money
blow It in, I guess they meanâ and give us
fellows a chance? Well we have blown some
of .it in. We have Improved the Jails and
made them habitable. We have repaired that
old bastile on Broadway till lt now looks like
something else than, a ruin. We did that out
of our savings. We. had an office that was a
disgrace to this city and we have improved
that. too. , That is the .way we have 1 blown
in ycur. money.' Every Republican official that
went in: at the same time aa I did has lust
as good a record to show. . â¢
-JThe meeting adjourned with cheers for
the. ticket.. .â,. . : . .
I John Lackmann, candidate for . Sheriff,
made a brief speech. He said, two years
ago he made promises that Iff elected he
would try to carry out and referred to
his career in office as.- a rebuke to the
complaint made that Republican officials
were dishonest. He said: ' :
need something: more than honesty. The Board
or tnibllc works has cost four times as much
for salaries as it â¢ has expended for improve-
m f? ts ;" The Democratic party has always been
run of promises. The nominees xm this ticket
are just as good. Just as honest and just as
capable as any on the Democratic ticket. v
ISSUES OF CAMPAIGN ARE DISGUSSED BY SPEAKERS.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 28.â
Dr. Paul S. Beinsch, professor of political
science in the University of Wisconsin,
will deliver: a course of lectures before
the students of the university during the
week beginning October 28 on "Motives
and Method* of Modern Colonial Ex
pansion."
Lectures on Expansion.
. VACAVILLE, Oct. 26.â There was a re
union of Odd Fellows . here to-night.
Grand Master William Nichols and other
grand officers attended. Degree teams
came from Apollo Lodge of San Francisco
and Industrial Lodge of Sacramento, and
300 delegates from Sulsun, Elmlra, Dlxon,
Vallejo and Birds Landing attended.
Twenty-five candidates were initiated. A
banquet followed the. ceremony.
Reunion of Odd Fellows.
"At no time In the discussion did I state
that the hours and wages therein fixed
were unfair or that 'the wages were ex
cessive. In: fact, I strongly expressed
myself as in favor of the rate of wage3
and the- hours of labor specified 4n the
bill. The only points raised and the only
points, discussed were as to whether or
not the~ bill conflicted with -certain provi
sions of the charter and whether the mat
ter was i in the, jurisdiction of the Board
of - Supervisors â¢ or the \ Board :\u25a0 of Public
Works.' It was the sincere desire of each
and every member of. the, board,, includ
ing, myself, to fix the wages at $2 50 and
the period of work at eight hours a day,
if It could be legally done. J ' ? ' J -â¢\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0-*\u25a0
f My views now coincide with the-views
then expressed. I am strongly In favor
of the rate of $2 50 per day and a period
of eight hours for a day's labor, and have,
never expressed myself otherwise."
"In February, 1900, an ordinance was
introduced Into the Board of Supervisors
fixing the rate of pay of laborers em
ployed by the Board of -Public Works at
$2 50 per day. Considerable discussion
arose at that time as to whether 'this or
dinance conflicted with certain provisions
of .the charter. .For' the purpose of final
ly determining the,' legality of the ordi
nance, it was moved to refer the matter
to the City Attorney for his, opinion- I
voted for the motion and it was defeated.
"X motion was then made to refer the
matter to the Board of Public Works. a3 !
it was a matter within that board's juris
diction. That motion was also lost. THe
bill was then put on- final passage and I
voted In favor of it.V It was unanimously
adopted. . * . ' -
One of those insidious political attacks
toTy which the Examiner Is so 'famous Is
about to be launched against .the Demo
cratic candidate for Mayor, Joseph ," S.
Tobin. For weeks past the Examiner has
been coquetting with everybody In the po
litical arena. One day it has - been red
hot for Tobin. The next day some other
person, has caught the fancy of this po
litical chameleon,' and he has been,sup
ported. \u25a0 .
I "Now an out and out fight is to be made
against Tobin. The Examiner is to ac
cuse him of being an enemy of labor,
basing the charge on an incident that oc
curred in the : Board of Supervisors in
February, 1900. At that time there was
under discussion an ordinance fixing: the
pay of laborers employed on city work
at $2 50 per day. The fixed the
minimum wage at $2, and a question was
raised aa to the legality of paying more..
A motion to refer the ordinance to the
City and County Attorney was .defeated,
Mr. Tobin voting with" the minority to
refer. A second motion to refer the mat
ter .to the Board of Public' Works was
defeated by similar action. On the final
passage of the ordinance every Super
visor voted in favor, of it, and It now is
the law of the city. It is upon the first
two votes that -the Examiner bases its
charge that Mri Tobln Is an enemy of la
bor, r ' . â¢- \u25a0;';\u25a0'
When asked : for an explanation, Mr.
Tobin said last night: -. \u25a0

A HEW ANNOUNCEMENT.
IF YOU ARE SICK
Let Me Know It.
5 I wish simply your name and address-
no money. Tell me which of these six
books" you want.
I will send with It an order on your drug-
gist to let you have 6 bottles Dr. Shoop"s
Restorative. He will let you take It for a
month; then. If it succeeds, he will charge
you $5 50 for it. If it fails, he will send
the bill to me. He will trust to your
honesty, leaving the decision to you.
Such an offer as this could not be made
on any other remedy. It would bankrupt
the physician who tried it.' But In five
years I have supplied my Restorative on.
these terms to 550,000 people. My records
show that 33 out of each 40 paid, for it. be-
cause they were cured.
This remedy alone strengthens those in-
side nerves that operate all vital organs.
It brings back the only power that can
make each organ do its duty. No matter
how difficult the case, it will permanently
cure unless some organic trouble like
cancer makes a cure impossible, ''\u25a0 .
I fcave spent my lifetime in preparing
this remedy. I offer now to- pay for all
you take if it fails. I cannot better show
my fatlh in it. Won't you" merely write
a postal to learn if I can help you?
Simply state Book No. 1 on Dyspepsia,

SAN JOSE. Oct 26.â The gardeners of
the State Normal School, assisted by
members of the faculty, students, small
boys and stray dogs, enjoyed a gopher
hunt to-day. More than 200 of the ro
dents were killed in a territory covering
less than two acres. Gophers have been
a nuisance on the grounds and the gar
deners have started a crusade against
them. In an alfalfa patch of about a
half acre 112 were killed this forenoon,
and In the afternoon's work about the
same number were found. The ground
was flooded with water and -when tne
animals came to the surface In a half
drowned condition they were either
killed with a club or caught by dogs.
More Than Two Hundred Rodents Are
Slain on San Jose Normal

SERIES OF ADDRESSES
TO GRAIN-GROWEKS
J. Francisco Charbez of New Mexico
spoke interestingly of Arizona's and New
Mexico's early history, their territorial
governments and their efforts In the
direction of statehood. A number of
others spoke briefly.
The convention was entirely harmoni
ous. Letters of congratulation were read
from Congressman Cushing and Dele
gate Rhody. The convention closed with
thÂ«s readoption of the old statehood con
stitution prepared in 189L
The following committee was chosen to
go to Washington and lay the claims of
th'j Territory before Congress: W. C.
Greene. L#. W. Mix, E. B. Gage, Thomas
Brockroan, John Lawler and W. J.
Murphy.
A finance committee composed of one
member from each of the thirteen coun
tiâ¬â¬ was, named.
A reception was tendered "to-night to
Governor Otero and .the other New
Mexico delegates. It was largely attended.
Governor Murphy of Arizona ' spoke
eloquently of Arizona's claims to state
hood, her achievements and her resources.
Delegate Mark Smith made a short but
Impressive speech, declaring that the
Issue of statehood had been kept in the
background by the men in Congress, lest
political jealousies be excited. He was
hopeful of a vote, however, at the coming
s-t-t sion and an early admission to th-*
Union.
Governor Otero of New Mexico made a
brief but stirring speech, referring to
Arizona as a rib taken from New Mexico,
her best helpmate. He spoke or the un
fair reports of casual visitors, who sea
only the wild West features of the coun
try, and reviewed New Mexico's constant
effort in the interest of Arizona and the
military reforms of both Territories.
: Committee Is Chosen. /
The resolutions were strong in tone, anJ
their reading aroused the convention to
a. high pitch of enthusiasm. When the
closing sentence was read, declaring that
"Arizona relies upon the sense of justice
of both branches of Congress," the dele
gates arose to their feet, the Indian band
played Sousa's "Stars and Stripes For
ever" and the convention became a pan
demonium of enthusiasm.
* Farther Delay an Injustice.
Ths resolution further declares that
thesis conditions are more than iuirilled in
Arizona and that further delay 'in ad
mitting the Territory to full membership
in the sisterhood of States would be an
injustice to thÂ» people; that Arizona has
been a Territory â¢ tor thirty-eight years
and now has greater wealth and popula
tion than had a majority of the States
at the time of their admission to the
Union; that no area of equal extent weot
of the Mississippi River possesses greater
or more varied resources, and that Ari
zona, by reason of her desire and ability
for self-government and also by reason ot
her loyalty, as exhibited in the recent
war with Spain, is justly entitled to state
hood.
PHOENIX. Ariz., Oct 26.-Arizona's
campaign for statehood was launched to
day in the most enthusiastic convention
ever held in the Territory. Everyvcounty.
municipality and commercial organiza
tion sent delegates,, and the body of ac
credited delegates that met in the local
opers.-house taxed the capacity of that
building.
The: convention was called to order at
10 o'clock by A. J. Doran of Prescott,
\u25a0who was made temporary chairman. E.
J. Trippel of Tucson and R. L.. Patterson
of Holbrook were elected secretaries of
the temporary organization. The usual
committees on credentials, resolutions and
permanent organization were then ap
pointed and the meeting took a recess
until 2 o'clock.
When the convention came to order for
the afternoon session -the temporary
organization was made permanent. Reso
lutions were presented and adopted, wita
great enthusiasm and without a dissenting
vote, declaring "that Arizona is justly
entitled to be rreed from the present ter
ritorial form of government, as it has
been the unvarying custom of the Fed
eral movement to admit Territories to
statehood when their population, weahli
and the intelligence of the people are suf
ficient to warrant s,uch action."
Choose Committee to Present
Appeal to President and
Congress.

fcr the grand opera season to be given
by Maurice Grau's people will begin at
the Grand Opera-house and there's going !
to be a line worth seeing. There are to
'be twenty subscription performances for
which the sale opens j to-morrow. The
single seat sale will open November 6.
Mr. Grau's list of artists this year 13
an imposing . one. It incluaes a number
of singers new to San Francisco. Melba
and Nordlca will not be here, but there
are Emma Eames, Emma Calve. Sybil
Sanderson and Marcella Sembrich, names
to conjure with. Plancon, the gorgeous,
is on the other side of the Atlantic, but
there is Emillo de Marchi/' said to be a
mrrvel In the way of tenora. v Edouard
de Reszke, Bispham, Van Dyke, Robert
Blasa,"' Scottl, Dippel, will bo here, with
Schumann-Heink, Gadski, Louise Homer
and other favcrites of last year. The
season, indeed, bids fair to outvie all the
well-remembered glories of our first
Grau season; '. ;
'The programme for the first week has
already been arranged. It is a particular
piece of splendor that makes one's mouth
water to read it. Contrary "to precedent
"Aida" will not open the bill, but Instead
the opening performance on Monday, No
vember 11, will be "Lohengrin," that will
introduce Emma Eames to San Francisco
audiences in the role of Elsa. â¢
"Carmen". on Tuesday will serve for the
debut of Emma Calve. Marcella Sem
brich will be the heroine of "La Traviata"
on Wednesday and the role of Alfredo will
be sung by Emlllo de Marohi. Thursday
evening will be another great occasion,
for it will mark the debut here of Sybil
Sanderson in "Manon," one of her best
roles, that she studied with Massenet
himself. "Les Huguenots" will be sung
on Friday evening with a cast that will
include Mmes. Gadski, Louise Homer and
Sembrich and Messrs. De Marchi, Jour
net, Scottl and Edouard de Reszke. Sat
urday afternoon will be devoted to
"Faust," with Emma Calve as Marguer
ite, Edouard de Reszke as Mephlstopheles
and Andreas Dipple in the title role. In
the evening "Tannhauser" will be sung
with a cast that will enlist the services
of ' Emma Eames, Louise Reuss-Belce,
Ernest Van Dyck, Robert Blass and David
Blspham. During the ' season of three
weeks Mr. Grau promises very few rep
etitions, several novelties and some inter
esting revivals.
ALCAZAR'S NEW LEADING
' LADY AND A STAR IN
"SPORTING LIFE." J
WITH "Carmen" according to Col
lamarlni and the latest addition
to the Tivoli repertoire. "La
Boheme," the grand opera sea
son at the popular little opera-
house will close this week.
There is also another bill, one of the best
ever given at the TIvoII, arranged for to
morrow evening, for the testimonial per
formance to Paul Steindorff, the leader
of the orchestra. Mr. Steindorff has made
many friends since his advent here, and
his good vrork during the season has won
fcr him the sincere respect and liking of
all Tivoli devotees, who will doubtless
turn out in full force to do him honor
to-morrow evening. There ,is to be a
large orchestra to begin with, forty
pieces, and the orchestral numbers will
include the overtures from "Tannhauser,"
"William Tell" and "Lohengrin." There
will also be acts from "Carmen" (second),
"Lucia" (second, the "sextet" act), "II
Trovatore" (sixth act). Then Agostini
\u25a0will sing "Spirito Gentile" from "La Fa
vorita," and with Dado and Barbareschl
the famous trio from "I Lombard!." . All
of the singers of the season, except
Salassa, will be heard.
It is an astonishingly good "La Boheme"
they are giving us this week at the Tlvoli.
Agostini is delightful. He is in excellent
voice, and sings Jbe spirited, 'nervous
music with admirable artâ he is, of course,
Rudolph â as If he had been born to the
part. Montanarl is a charming Miml, and
her best work by much is done in this
part, though her Santuzza is also pleas

WHEN one remembers the extreme. difficulty experienced in rescuing persons who are
kidnaped by miscreants in this country, the difficulties in the case of Miss Stone will
be appreciated. We cannot revile other countries in which these crimes occur, for
they are too frequent â¢ here. Of course if it can be. proved that either the Turkish or
Bulgarian government connived at the abduction of that American missionary we have the right
of reprisal against the guilty government. But to establish that right the proof must be clear.. It
is evident that at present we have no such proof, and all that we can' ask is that the brigands be
punished, if caught, by the government that has jurisdiction of them.
It is coming to be a novel feature in missionary Avork that itis frequently the cause of in
ternational broils. The vast woe and waste inflicted upon China grew out of the presence there
of missionaries, and now if we fix responsibility upon Bulgaria in Miss Stone's case we can strike
that country only. through the co-operation of Russia or some power nearer than we, from whose
frontier she is accessible. If. we, do this we assume an obligation to that intervening power.
These complications indicate that the Christian nations should come to some special agree
ment as to their sole or mutual obligations to missionaries: The issue presented is peculiar. It has
no analogy in the obligations of .\u25a0.government to; the commercial, class. Merchants are' abroad
from their own country to ..establish trade, in ''which the material gain is supposed to be equal, the
people among, whom they go getting .their. fhare, of it. Not many, international issues arise over
the presence of merchants. : They usually obey the laws and respect the customs of the country to
which they go, and it is a necessary' part of ;'their "business to cultivate good relations witH the
people. With missionaries it is different. They are not always .Worldly wise, and they of neces
sity antagonize the class that have in. charge the, spiritual; affairs > of the people. When this class,
as is usually the case in what we call heathen countries, have relations with- the civil government
its power is sure to be. invoked againstthe religious invaders. Where the- religion is national and
is interwoven with the civil institutions of the country, an attack upon it is of necessity an
assault upon the government itself. Every subject of such government \vhd adopts Christianity
of necessity is looked upon as a traitor to his own country, and in the- Christian propaganda the
seeds of endless trouble are "planted."
The Christian powers seem to owe it to themselves and to the world's peace to settle by
general treaty : between them how far they will become responsible for their missionaries. The
United State's by its constitution refuses to give aid and 'strength to any special form of religion
at home. Here Jew and Gentile,' Protestant and Catholic;: Christian v and Pagan, may .'all build
their altars and worship before them, uninterrupted and unaided by .the. Government. Therefore it
may well be asked what "right/ have .we, as a' government; 'to talceany part in protecting and en
forcing by treaty or otherwise the imposition of Christianity abroad?' What right have we to send
armies, to protect the propagandists 'of any religion among a strange and alien people? , '
-Surely it is quite time that the rights and duties of our Government in that respect
were defined. ' ; ' k
/The splutter over Roosevelt's dinner invitation to Booker T. . \yashington has led some
one to recall^ the fact that Lincoln once- invited Fred Douglass to tea: Of course Douglass â¢ was
not exactly a negro and tea is not exactly dinner, but none the: less \u25a0 the Lincoln invitation is
a good enough precedent for Roosevelt if he feels any need of one. / â -^
THE CASE OF MISS STONE.
capriccioso" Musetta, she is a coquettish
and dainty little figure. Ferrari comes out
strongly as Marcelâ Puccini gives him no
chance at the tremoloâ and with his fine
barytone and ample comedy spirit Is ex
cellently satisfying as the impecunious
artist. Zani does unusually well as
Schaunard, and Dado lends his splendid
bass . to the fourth member of the Bo
hemian quartet, Colline. The orchestra,
as usual, is always there, in fact, more
there than usual, and the chorus scene in
the second act Is very well ordered. The
opera" is exceptionally well staged and
costumed.

It is many days since I have had the
pleasure of hearing so graceful and fin
ished a singer as Mrs. M. E. Blanchard,
who gave her first song recital in Sher
man & Clay Hall last Tuesday evening.
Mrs. Blanchard has been away from San
Francisco for some ,two years, studying
her art both in New York and Boston,
and she. has clearly made excellent use of
her time. Her voice is not particularly
strong, neither is it of exceptional range,
but it is of smooth, silky quality, round
and sweet, and eminently sympathetic.
It is beautifully used, too, Mrs. Blanch
ard's work being conspicuous for its deli
cate nuance and artistic phrasing. There
is a slight weakness of the attack oc
casionally, a sort of "feeling after the
pitch." sometimes to be observed, but
apart from this the singer is both mus 1 
cally and technically gifted in an un
common degree, and will prove a valu
able addition to the contralto forces o.*
the city. Fred Maurer accompanied Mrc
Blanchard and distinguished himself, a-,
usual, by the quick sympathy, crispness
and discretion of his work. , The singer

Mrs. Blanchard's programme was all
that might have been expected "from her
kind of singer. Ranging from Scarlatti
("Se Florinda" and "O e'essate di Piag
armi") to some modern gems by Clayton
Johns ("Nereid's Lullaby" and- "Wild
Hunt") and Including old French, old
English and old Scotch', ballads, - besides
songs by Brahms ("Main'acht". and "Ver
gebliches Staendcheh") Mendelssohn,
Schumann, Schubert,; Franz and others!
the programme covered a wide field of the
choicest song literature. â¢ The singer
showed herself well at home . with a 1 1
classes, and particularly well at home in
the rare art of ballad singing. "The
Ravens" and Dr. Arne's '.'Where the Bee
Sucks" were purely .\u25a0 ' delightful, the
Brahms "Vergebliches Staendchen" was
given with all its quaint point and Intent,
and. so on throughout the programme.
Mrs. Blanchard is indeed an artist, an.l
her future recitals should be well at
tended by all who like a good song well
sung. ,
This week will be a crowded one in the
music market, what with the Tivoli's la.st

IP only to afford Stuart Robson oppor
tunity for his Bertie the Lamb, not
to mentions Maclyn Arbuckle's Old
Nick. "The Henrietta" continues
amply to justify its existence. It is
not every day that a role like Bertie the
Lamb is created, and still more seldom
that an actor can be found to fit it when
created. It is one of those simple-subtle
conceptions that more easily come to grief
than an omelet in the hands of the usual
kitchen divinity. Ninety-nine times out of
a lumdeed it- receives the. same treatment.
The hundredth time a Stuart Robson hap
pens along-and Voila! there Is a "lamb"
that will live as long as many Marys go
toschool. It is a fine and simple art that
Mr. Rcbson brings to his work here. Only
the picture Trf a dude he has to .give usâ
a clever, careless fellow, with a genius for
idleness and clothes. He has never earn
ed a cent in his life, that he has innocent
ly spent sucking a very handsome cane
at stage doors and laboriously building
up a reputation for desperate wickedness
that every line of his ingenuous counte
nance unkindly belies. In his set it is
the current fad to be a desperate follow,
so he does his best that way, just as he
turns up his trousers when it rains in
Lunnon, because the other fellows do. A
character built on simplest lines, and only
acceptable when it is played -with the
genius for unconsciousness that Mr. Rob
son possesses, It is lavishly funny in his
hands. There is no shoving the funny
points at you, no crooking a. busy finger
or overworking a wink, to label a jest
that might otherwise bloom unseen. His
Bertie might have stepped from a band
box, with all the blessed lack of humor
that the. "chappie" type wears as com
monly as its chrysanthemum, so gloriously
unconscious he is of his "own comicality.
The big difference .between Bertie and
the d^ude in general is that he has thought
fit to ? his manners and morals
as wetl laundered, brushed and
combed as his shoes, shirt, hat and hair.
The way in which Mr. Robson just
makes "him say "On my honor as a gen
tleman," in denying that he is guilty of
a certain ein laid at his door, the way in
which he makes him stop short in his
denial : to take the aforesaid sin (his
brother's) upon himself, with the simplest
gestures arid facial play, is a small marvel
in the way of the portraiture of a gentle
man. And the picture is consistent
throughout, not a false stroke anywhere.
From his dellciously matter-of-fact love
making to his equally wonderful stock
broking, the part is carried through with
the same firm, clean touch, and 'Mr. Rob
son has the sympathy of the audience
from first to last.
Old Nick is the other "fat" part and
Mr. Arbuckle makes the best of it He
shines both in. the heavy emotional scenes
and in the opportunities for lighter work.
It Is a particularly powerful scene where
he finds out "young Nick's" treachery,
and Mr. Arbuckle, who is ably seconded
by Buss Whytal, Roy Atwell and Charles
Lane, carries it off with flying? colors.
His . transition from the confident, bluff
old "bull" of Wall street, who has swiing
the money market so long that he cannot
conceive of things happening any other
way, to the broken - and ruined ' old man
with" all that he had to live for gone, is
a powerful and pathetic effort. Neither
does he fail in lighter vein.- In his scenes
with the widow and with the Rev. Murray
Hiltonâ who looks as if he had' been left
over from the Episcopal Conventionâ Mr.
Arbuckle shows himself a humorous and
genial actor.

besides "those mentioned" there" Is a good

AT this short distance it looks as if Oakland needs . an application of . the public policy
which we are earnestly seeking in San Francisco. ... ... .-. <
, That city' is a fair city. ; Joaquin Miller overlooks it from his heights, has celeV
brated it in" poetry.: and in prose has said that its site is fit for a "city of the Caesars." But
Oakland is suffering from conditions -that the managers of its business seem incapable of chang
ing. Last spring a crisis appeared in the school affairs, and as the city is known as the Athens
of the coast, this was painful. The Attic lamp flickered for some time, because, the Council had
not furnished the means to run the High School to the end of the term. Meetings were held,
the hat was passed, card parties and N other ways were proposed to furnish the funds to keep t the;
High School going until .its senior class could graduate. The members of the defaulting Council
passed the responsibility to the School Board, but that body side-stepped \u25a0; and " let it pass. The
public discovered that the School . Board does not assess property nor levy taxes, but merely
spends what the Council provides for it, and that it had riiade requisition on -that 'body for, the
funds needed to keep the schools going. Some arrangement was made to tide over the difficulty
without starting a lottery to raise money or compelling the teachers to do a month's work for
nothing. But we believe. this settlement did not settle, and that the. teachers. are still unpaid. If
we are mistaken in this we congratulate the teachers.
Athens felt happy, at the beginning of the present school year, in the expectation that all
the classes would go smoothly forward to the end. ,But the School Board proposes and the City
Council disposes. The night classes are part of the school system. They are a most valuable and
very necessary part. They are attended by apprentices Â«and other youth who are working : "heir
way. In the ranks of such young people are always some of the very best.' There may be fcund
the material that is. going to take a great part in the world.. Give it the chance to get. some
knowledge in school and it will go forward with resistless energy and impulse. Oakland seems
to abound in such youth, and the School Board has made a point of supplying them with the
facilities they require'. But hills must be paid, and the bills of the night classes to the end of the
school year will amount to $4000. The funds on hand for that purpose will be exhausted Novem
ber 1, and the night classes must cease at. that date. . .
From the papers we learn that the Council appears to think it is the business of the School
Board to keep the classes going. The board retorts that since the foreman of Pharoah's brickyard
ordered the Israelites to make adobes without straw there has not been a more unreasonable de
mand. In behalf of the Council the retort is made that the board should cut off classes and thin
out and abridge the work in the Central High School and put the parings into the night classes.
Now it happens that the Central High is the polytechnic department of the school system
of Athens. In it are business classes, and it teaches beyond, the rudiments of the handicrafts.
It is the only technical school on that side of the bay. On this side we have the Lick and Cogs
well schools and the Wilmerding in preparation. "So the Central High 'is regarded as the prac
tical feature, and there is widespread objection to crippling it. This seems to have made oome
impression upon the City Council, which holds the Athenian cornucopia, and that body now in
sists that members of the School Board make personal contribution to support the night classes.
As those members serve without pay^and give much time to the public with no return
except that ineffable dividend called the sense pf a duty discharged, we take the responsibility of
regarding this suggestion as immaterial,, irrelevant and incompetent.- From the same source it
is proposed that the secretary of the School Board put his salary of $50 per month into the poor
box and that the teachers of the whole department. are expected to make up the balance!
\ We fear that before long the inquiry will begin to run, "What's the matter with Oakland?"
That city needs to wake up to its responsibilities as. a near neighbor of San Francisco. Carndgie
gave Oakland a library and a few citizens bought a site for the building, the late! Mr/ C. P.
Huntington being .the .largest contributor to that- purcHase. j The building is finished, but the city
seems unable to furnish it, and the library trustees applied'to 'Mr.. Carnegie for' nidre money* for
that purpose. Men and brethren, Athenians, all, what is ;the matter with you? If your- charter-is
not right, if it fits you like a boy's knickerbockers^ fit a man, get another charter, bring" your in

here as nothing since President Kruger's

Rhodesian influence, which has dictated
public opinion since the outbreak of the
war and which nine out <jf ten people hold
responsible for this drastic act, has been
shattered to its center by the. latest ex

weeks people have been growing discon
tented at the supine neglect of this Gov
ernment to do anything to clear up the
muddle in South Africa. This discontent
is likely to burst aflame with indignation
if the already formidable agitation of the
protest in favor of Sir Redvers Buller
continues as it has begun. It i3 the one
topic of conversation wherever one goes.
Men, who months ago declared themselves
sick of talking about the war, find it im
possible to. refrain from joining in the
general chorus of indignation.
"Good old Buller" promises to become
a national cry as it already - forms the
topic of music hall songs. Party lines

retary of State. He has accepted the po
sition as European commissioner of the

luchistan,". :who to an unusual extent has'
succeeded A in exciting and ..baffling^ Lon
don's curiosity,, and. who is .variously de
scribed'as- an' Indian -potentate' and a
prince of Siam, sailed October 24 from
Liverpool; for Montreal cm "the .steamer
Lake Simcoe, whence he. is going; to-New
York, accompanied by a dusky suite num
bering twenty-eight persons. . T
; He lived a -fortnight in all the splendor
of Oriental, opulence at a* fashionable Lon
don hotel, where he had dropped in un
announced ; and unconcernedly engaged
twenty-three rooms..' In â¢ spite of - the
publicity which' such an 'arrival was
bound to create, 'he has left England'as
much in : thei dark as to his identity ; as
when he arrived. The India Office has,is
sued an official announcement that there
is no such -Indian chief aor "Prince Ranji
of Beluchistan," but neither condemns
the mysterious stranger nor clears up 'his
Identity, as Ranji is palpably an assumed
name. . \u25a0 . \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0
When interviewed in London, where he
by no means' courted publicity, Prince
Ranji declined to say whence he 'came,
but he once oracularly remarked: "I am
a king." Whether he is or is 'not asking,
he certainly lived like one, spending enor
mous sums of money. The .retinue which
sailed with him included " musicians who
produced from weird instruments still
more weird sounds. A dancing girl formed
a prominent part of the daily entertain
ments which the suite provided for thoir
master, who spent most of his time in
bed. He is a man of fine physique, dark
skinned and handsome. All his food was
prepared in accordance with the strict
est Oriental usages by his own servants,
who wore gorgeous robes and were night
ly marshaled by a r major-domo for ex
ercise in an adjoining, park.
This mysterious party will, it is said,
make a tour of Canada and the United
States, returning to England in time for
King Edward's coronation.

the unions in the city were represented,
was held to-night, the letter of the manu

being discussed at length. The "council
decided that it would leave the matter
of a strike entirely in the hands of the
unions, which action-is in" line with their
previous "determination. It was decided
to hold general meetings of all. the. unions
next Wednesday night, at which time ac
tion /will : be* taken. It is said there is
little 'doubt that this action will be a
vote to strike.
There is a strong, sentiment here against
a strike, owing to the effect It will have
on all classes of business. ; -The. manu
facturers do. not take this view, however,
and' believe ; the operatives will strike. It
is possible that the Spinners' Union may

aVNatlonal University." :. " â¢/ -
One of the striking signs of discontent
within the circles - traditionally Govern
mental is found in , the fact'that the Cam
bridge Union has passed a resolution -to
the effect that the Government alone Is
responsible for the prolongation of the
war. . This aristocratic debating society
is composed mainly of those who are re
lated or acquainted with the ruling class
and who have hitherto always warmly
supported the Government's South Afri
can policy. A reversal of feeling in such
a great university as Cambridge means,
perhaps, more than any demonstrations
or political meetings.
Rumors were rife^ regarding Cabinet
changes during the early part of the
week. It was persistently said that Sir
Michael Hicks-peach, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, - whose relations- with
Chamberlain have never been cordial, was
determined to step. out. and Hanbury, the
president of the Board of Agriculture, it
was said, was to succeed him. Inquiries
made, however, point to the fact that Sir
Michael will remain in office,; though not
very willingly, and that no serious Cabi
net shake-up is likely to occur in the near
future. . \u25a0 .. . - '\u25a0â¢ \u25a0 . . â¢
Go vernment , Alone Responsible.
: There is no end of criticism current re
garding the Government's conduct of the
war in South Africa, but it emanates
chiefly from those whom Chamberlain in
his speech last night characterized as his
candid friends. The outcry does not ap
pear to strengthen in the slightest the
chances of the Liberal party.
R. C. Lehmann, who has just resigned
the editorship, of the Dally News, in an
article in this week's Speaker admits that
he sees no hope for liberalism until it
has acquired and put forward a strong,
definite policy in regard to South Africa.
To do this, he confesses, would mean the
loss to the party of some of its most
prominent supporters, but he maintains
that even this is better than the present
impotency. ~-

LONDON. Oct. 26.â A special from Brus

and Great Britain ' again appear to be
somewhat strained.? According to intel
ligence which is being circulated here,
Great Britain asked -Holland to recall her
Consul at Pretoria because he was sus
pected of facilitating treasonable corre"

Indefinite leave of absence. : . - ,-..

from, the corporation, said he hoped his
visit to Natal would lead toa few tenta

The ,"Freis!nn!ge Zeitung indorses the
above remarks, but says the fault Is not

the fact that'.these African colonies, ex
cept in quite unimportant districts, are
wholly worthless and cannot be improved
by any sort of. recipe; :\ \u25a0\u25a0: . â¢\u25a0 -
The Colonial Zeitung, organ of the Co
lonial Bureau and the Colonial Secretary?
rejects Professor Meyer's plans,; which it
says would injure the colonies immensely.
The Freisinnlge Zeitung points to the
fact that self-government 'is -impossible
for German East Africa, since there are
only 286 Germans there. â¢ .: '
The Taegliche Rundschau asserts that
the present system of government from
Berlin has not satisfied the friends of the
colonies and that Germans who live in
Africa are affected by colonial pessim
ism.' .'The paper adds; that: the present
state of things cannot be improved by
festivities, patriotic speeches and the cir
culation of literature. , . -.
"WoulS Injure Colonies.
, Professor Hans Meyer, who has traveled
in the colcmies, recently wrote a series
of articles for the Taeglfche Rundschau,
arguing in favor of a~radlcal change in
the system of governing the colonies. He
says "â¢the Government must abandon the
centralization which ate Berlin, holds the
colonies in bonds, claiming it is better to
give them self-govenrmentyand'to abolish
the appropriation* .for the col
onies, except in the case of providing for
the, troops and- naval lor their
protection. <r. ;, '.ivc,^ w. N
The Cologne Volks Zeitung refers to,al
leged attempts 'in American newspapers
to create an anti-German sentiment by
the assertion that Germany wants to es
tablish colonies in South America, ad
mitting that the. Pan-German newspapers
have given abundant cause therefor. The
paper classifies the whole idea as being
among the most splendid castles built in
the, air. The Cologne Volks Zeitung also
says it will 'be one hundred to one. that
suspicions will- be cast upon > Germany's
policy, because she has decided to estab
lish an information bureau in .- Berlin for
emigrants, under the management of an
official who was formerly a German Con
sul in South America. -. : . ,â¢ . \u25a0"
Colonial affairs and the establishment
of the emigration bureau have been wide
ly.: discussed during the week. The ob
ject, of the bureau is to^gulde German
emigration into the colonies, but the press
is largely skeptical of Its success. \u25a0 *
The Cologne Volks Zeitung calls this
Utopian, and also regards Dr. Wagner as
being wrong in thinking President Roose
velt intends to * adopt a harsher policy
toward Great Britain, since the latter has
already conceded- all that the United
States wants.i- â¢ â¢ . '-. i
No Harsher Policy.
The paper continues: "The Pari-Ameri
can'ideals solely, capable of development
upon the basis of' the subjection, of 'all
America to the hegemony of the United
States. The republics of Anglo-Saxon and
Latin Apierica differ so greatly respecting
territorial conditions and the composition
of the populations that a closer union is
only conceivable upon the pre-supposltion
of a decisive predominance^ of .the United
States.". â¢ --.:;/ . ,
'Dr. Hans "Wagner discusses the subject
at length in Der Tag. He says the Mon=
roe doctrine no longer means America for
Americans, but North Americans. Dr."
Wagner hopes for an international com
mission which will prepare a well merited
grave for the Monroe phrase. --. '. â¢>â¢"

power of personal influence. Jay Gould
piled up millions by this same power. J.

lions simply by his marvelous ability to

Cttarrh has become such a common
disease that a person, entirely free from
this disgusting complaint is seldom met
with. It is customary to speak of Catarrh
es nothing more serious than a bad cold,
a simple inflammation of, the nose and
throat.' It is, in fact, a complicated and
very dangerous disease ; if not at first, it
very soon becomes so.
The blood is quickly contaminated by
the foul secretions, and the poison through
the general circulation is carried to all
parts of the system."
Salves, washes and sprays are unsatis-
factory and disappointing, because they do
not reach the seat of the trouble. . S. S. S.

and eliminates from the system all catar-

exposed the New England Wireless Tele

cern has as one of its figureheads James
N. Houston; who was "United- States
Treasurer under President Harrison, but
who felt forced -. to resign by reason of
misunderstandings with Harrison. Hous
ton's name and former official post are
duly exploited on the stationery of the
Wireless Telegraph Company.
Thomas B. Bishop is the company's
president The Herald Bhows that he has
been identified with- several questionable
enterprises. Including a bucket-shop for
women. The New England Wireless Tele
graph Company has been filling Eastern
newspapers with glittering prospectuses.
The institution has its headquarters in
delightfully furnished offices in Philadel
phia. â¢ Just before the recent yacht races
Bishop .tried to induce Associated Press
bulletins by the obsolete Dolbear wireless
system. In- a contest at law Marconi has
shown that Dolbear has no standing as
an inventor of the system of wireless
telegraph that/ employs a "coherer."
Nevertheless this wireless company has
been selling stock rapidly, of late and em
ploys a large corps of typewriters to an
swer huge correspondence.
Manager Stone of the Associated Press
repudiated " Bishop's system and used
Marconi's exclusively at first, but Bish
op's tug. with a wireless outfit . aboard,
succeeded In Interfering .with Marconi's
transmission by setting up cross currents.
The Associated PreBS realized it could
send no satisfactory bulletins on account
of this Interference and was compelled to
make terms with Bishop. The latter took
advantage of this and exploited his yacht
race reports as an advertisement. - The
Herald felt compelled to expose the meth
ods of Bishop's company., . . -.

THE Norwegian -bark Hereford,
which arrived from Australia a
few days ago, had an experience
in Algoa Bay' that neither Cap
- tain Jensen nor the crew will for
get for many years to come.
The Hereford' was formerly a ' British
tea clipper and made a quick run from
Swansea to Cape Colony with a cargo of
coal. On arrival at Algoa Bay, during
the war, she had more than 2000 tons of
the black diamonds in her hold. _ The
Hereford is more than 1500 tons gross
burden, so there must have been easii/
3600 tons dead weight floating in Algoa
Bay when the baric cast anchor - last
December. .- \u25a0 \_ ;\u25a0\u25a0. ,
"It was a beautiful night,". said Captain
Jensen yesterday, "and the bay seemed
to be full of small fish. All of a suddÂ»n a
school of whales came in after the jmall
fry. One of them, the â¢ biggest and 1 ap
parently the leader- of the mammal?,
made straight for the Hereford. . -, I
"Now we were deep laden and close
inshore, so that there could not have
been ' more than ~ six feet between >; \u25a0 the
vessel's -keel 'and the ..bottom. - As the
whale came along in pursuit of the small
fish he saw the Hereford and took a dip.
He 1 must have been going at the rate of
forty miles an hour, -for he evidently got
half way under the ship. For two or three
minutes nobody could stand on deck,- an 1
I made sure the back ofthe Hereford was
broken. There were' two or three up
.heavels â¢ and then a' moment's rest. The
pext instant the whale came .up along
side and we thoaghthe was dead. He lay
without- motion .for several minutes an.l
then suddenly took a fresh lease of lifi
and put to sea like a redshauk.
".From that one experience I, have been
making deductions as to , the capacity of
a whale. There is no doubt that a well
grown mammal can raise 3500 tons, ' for
the one we had the encounter with raised
and shook the Hereford like a terrier. It
can go at express speed, as we were able
to judge, and I should think that one of
them harnessed to the Oceanic i .would
carry ' that leviathan across the Atlantl z
at a sixty-knot <gait and not stop to take
breath. I don't want any more whales
under my-ship.'V - '
MUTINEERS SENT TO SEA.
There was trouble at the Vallejo-street
float yesterday. / When the Austrian
steamer Klek arrived In port last month
seven of the crew were in irons and the
captain had to Invoke the aid of the local
police. Yesterday the steamship, with
96,248 centals ot wheat valued at $84,200
and 17,954 centals of rye .valued at $14,000
aboard, was ready for sea. The Austrian
Consul sent the â¢ mutineers back' aboard.
At the'float the captain put in an ap
pearance and two of the men made a rush
for him. One of them tried to brain him
witH his handcuffs, but was knocked
down by. a policeman's club. After a
violent struggle , the mutineers were got
aboard the Klek -and then turned over to
the captain. There was no effort made to
put them to work, and the vessel did not
put to sea.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â The game
warden and deputy of Colorado are se
verely arraigned in a report- received by
the indian Bureau to-day from Indian
A^ent My ton of the White Rocks (Utah)
reservation, now at Meeker, Colo. After
aa investigation of. the alleged infraction
Â©f the Colorado game laws by his In
dians, Myton reiterates his -charges 01
persecution of Eggleston, one of the
Indians arrested -and acquitted of the
charges, and who was then rearrested.
The Interior Department has asked the
Department of Justice to defend E&gle
ston- The agrent says he has ordered
borne the very few Indians off his reser
vation found in Colorado, and he- will
stay a. week longer to see that they go.
He says the Indians from the Southern
Ute and Navajo agencies hunt In Color
ado and that what they do is charged
to his Indians. He says be has found it
impossible to ' - meet a Colorado game
warden, or even > a special deputy game
warden, in the State, â¢ although he wired
ahead m order to get from them infor
mation about his Indians. . . .',-.*>
\u25a0Myton charges that the game wardens
took the Indians from Rio Blanco Coun
ty without any process of law, and that
public opinion is entirely with the Indians.
He Bays three Indian men, three In
dian women and a b.oy were forced to
trial without an interpreter, and after
being acquitted at 10 o'clock at night
were started at 1 o'clock in the morn
ing, ostensibly for their agency.
"About ten miles from Meeker," he
said, "the Indians discovered that he (thÂ©
deputy) .had lied to them and was taking
them to the railroad. They all broke
away from the deputy except old man
Eggleston, and he is now in jail at Glen,
wood Springs. They scattered, the In
dians' property all along the road, and
much of it has been stolen or destroyed.
Suit should be brought agalngt the game
warden to make him pay the Indians
damages." . -

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. GRANTS PASS, Or., Oct. 26â News is
received here from Crescent City that. the
British bark JBaroda, that ran ashore on
the Oregon coast some time ago and lies
high and dry on the beach below Bandon
probably will be rescued. Captain Burns,
the expert "wrecker, has gone to. work on
the wreck. Most'; of the appliances were
brought by -the steamer Mandalay on her
last trip from San Francisco. \u25a0\u25a0-..'< \u25a0\u25a0-.
Captain Burns Is confident the stranded
vessel can be pulled into deep water. The
only . difficulty will . be I the long distance
that '\u25a0 the tug doing the towing will be out
at sea. The .beach on which, the stranded
vessel sits . slopes , gradually out to sea
and -the towing tug, will not be able to
get closer in than one mile. A barge will
be anchored securely half way out, to be
used as a fulcrum. At the present time
the sea Is perfectly smooth In that vicin
ity and no trouble will be experienced in
that, respect; should a heavy, sea come on.
it V will -do no damage other than drive
the Baroda farther up the beach. : â¢ ,
-The plan adooted for the rescue of the
Baroda Is the same as.that followed re
cently In* the" saving, of the British bark
Poltalloch, which was stranded In the
same vicinity and was safely pulled, off
the sands; being now en route home with
a cariroof wheat. â¢ . - - â¢ \u25a0
"The Baroda is a bark of 1400 tons. She*
is stanchly built of steel and though she
has beenNbleaching on the sands for near
ly two months she has suffered but little
damage..- At low :tide she is completely
aut of water, so that one can walk around

Varlcocele is an enlargement of - the most
vital blood vessels in- man. The function of
these veins is to carry off waste, thus enabling
the organs to receive fresh nutrition. - The dia
case consists of a dilation and local stagnation
cf blood,' from which the organs are deprived
of their proper quantity and quality of nour-
ishment. : As a result, we find small, soft and
sometimes quite insensitive organs, . which are

THANKSGIVING DAYâ U. S. B. C,
City. Thursday was selected originally
for Thanksgiving day, It Is thought, be
cause it was so near the middle of the
week and gave opportunity for scattered
members of the family to come together
and return without violating the Sabbath.
The Puritans of New England, with whom
the observance of Thanksgiving day orig
inated, were very scrupulous In this latter

During the past summer the Congressional
Committee on Rivers and Harbors visited this
coast Our river systemsâ and the site of the
proposed barriers and settling basins were in
spected Some of the members of the debris
committee were present on most of the tour.
Our chairman was acquainted with the major
ity of the visiting Congressmen and thus had
ample opportunity to present our position and
ascertain their views thereon. It was the
general verdict of these Congressmen that the
project above referred to should be completed
at an early date, and that the Bear, Ameil
can and other streams below should receive im
mediate attention. \u25a0 Your committee cannot ac
count for the circulation of a rumor that Chair
man Burton of the River and Harbor Commit
tee had expressed himself while on this visit
in favor of the appropriation of the additional
sum of $160,000 by Congress, but desired to cou
ple It with a proviso that hydraulic mining
above the barriers should cease.
In various extended conversations held with
Mr Burton and others by our chairman, no
reference was made^ directly or indirectly to
such proviso, notwithstanding;, that hydraulic
mining was the subject considered. The trend
of. the. conversation was that with proper pro
tection to the rivers, mining of all kinds shouM
be permitted and encouraged, for the general
welfare. Knowing our delegation in Wash
ington both in the Senate and in the House,

In a general review of conditions the
debris committee also had the following
of interest to report: '
north, range 5 east, M. D. M. This land has
also been located by other parties who hava
conveyed their Interests to the Government,
and upon this state of facts the Hon. Attorney
General has directed that an action be brought
to confirm the title to this property in the
United States. To my mind there Is no doubt
of the ultimate success of these actions.
â¢ A' condemnation suit Is also to be instituted
against O'Brien to obtain certain lands in
â¢ections 82 and S4, 'which he -recently pur
chased from the' estate of Catherine Hallett,
deceased. These actions will be instituted and
prosecuted \u25a0 a3i:rapldly as circumstances will
P Regarding ttie action against O'Brien to com
pel specific nerformanee of his agreement or
October 22. 1900, I-'am of the opinion that ltis
unnecessary to make a tender of money to
O'Brien, because of the fact that he has al
ready rignlfled hia Intention of violating his
agreement. However, It Is not unwise to
make "assurance doubly Â«ure." and therefore
I have advised the California Debris Commis
sion that there can be no objection to tender
ing O'Brien the money which was so Kindly
offered by your association. '
In regafd to M. C. Dufflcy. I may state i that
he entered Into an agreement to sell to tho
Government his land, located in section 27
township 16 north, range S east, M. D. M., for
the sum of *20. Subsequently, following thj
example of O'Brien, he served upon the Gov
ernment officers- a notice of the repudiation of
IiIh former agreement and ha." Increased the
selling price of his land from Â»20 to *500.
A suit against Dufflcy to compel him to per
form the conditions of his contract will bÂ«
instituted this week. With thj determination
of these suits tho principal difficult es in the
way of the commission will be practically dis
posed of. There are two or three amicable suits
to be instituted against different persons who
by reason of some disability are unable to
mak.j a valid conveyance to the Government.
Th<Â» purchase price of the land to be Include'!
In the suits referred to has been agreed upon.
It will only remain for tho commission to ac
quire a few small pieces of land In order to
place it in a position where work can bo com
menced. \
The title of all of the landn desired by the
commission has been examined and reported
upon by this office to the Hon. Attorney Gen
eral of the United States. The abstract of
title, together with the report thereon; and
the deeds which have been executed and de
livered to the California Debris Commission
by various parties are all In the hands of the
Attorney General ,for his approval. Deeds
have been secured for Rlmost all of the land
that the commission desires for Its purpose.
M. C. Dufflcy and Jamea O'Brien are the
only land holders who have refused up to th!Â«
time to sell to the Government the land It re
nulrps of them. In order to carry out Its pro
ject.
On the 22<J day of October, 1900, O'Brien en
tered into a written agreement to sell to the
Government for $2500 certain parcels of his
hold'ngs In Yuba County which were desired
by the commission. Subsequently on the 29th
day of Jul,y of the present year O'Brien served
upon the Government officers a notice of the
withdrawal and repudiation of his former
ngreement. Since that time the Hon. Attorney
General of the United States has directed thin
office to Institute a suit to compel O'Brien to
perform the covenants of his agreement of
October 22, 1900. This 6Ult haa been filed and
is now pendlnp in the United States Circuit
Court for this district.
In addition to his refusal to comply with the
terms of his contract with the Government, he
has attempted to locate under the. United
Ftates minin* Irws the channel of the Tuba
River, between sections 31 and 37, township 16
:â¢ On the closing day of the convention
the debris committee . received from the
United. States District Attorney a state
ment concerning the legal status of the
affuir.s of the California Debris Commis
sion so far as they pertain to the ac
quisition of land for the construction of
dams on the Yuba River. This communi
cation, as It clears up the matter con
siderably and as it has not been pre
viously* published, is herewith given prac
tically in full as follows: .
The Legal Status.
Instead of listening to rumors and agitating
questions affecting the constitutionality of the
law, let us take, the position now occupied by
the Cabinet officers of tho Government,
namely, the Attorney General : and Secretary
of War, by the legal advisers of the Califor
nia Debris Oimmlf Â«ion and by said commis
sion. It cannot be assumed that the law of
llcers of the Government would permit the con
struction of great and costly works and main
tain Important -and far-reaching litigation If
there was any question of the validity In a
constitutional sense of the measure; besides we
are supported in this attitude by the decision
of the United State* courts.
This cannot be done without notice to all
parties Interested. We have no misgivings on
that point. All that Is necessary is to con
tinue on lines laid down - In the law, and the
result of operations will; . in - our \ judgment,
prove that the work of this association and its
friends has not been done In vain.
â¢" The committee also expressed; the opin
ion that In order to prevent > licensed
hydraulic mining above' the proposed bar
riers the present law must be repealed.
On this point, the .committee said: Â«\u25a0
.Does that mean that licensed hydraulic min
ing Is to be prohibited? Is it not only licensed
hydraulic mining: that we want now. as well
as after the construction of these barriers? A
glance even at this language will disclose that
it is only unlicensed and indiecriminate ' hy
draulic mining. that Is tp be inhibited.
; Another reference in the' report, also often
misunderstood, is that "when the works have
been completed and In operation for., several
years there will be time and opportunity, to
determine whether â¢ or | not the system la
capable of sufficient expansion to warrant an
attempt at storing therein 'the talllnsrs from
the hydraulic mines without compelling each
.mine to impound any or- ail of Its debris."
This has no reference to mines working and
Impounding tailings at or near the place of
operation under a license, but to the question
whether when the Government dams are built
the "storlnK therein of the ; tailings from the
hydraulic mines. without compelling each mine
to impound any or all of its debris" will be
permitted, thus giving hope that the efforts
of the commission will be directed to investi
gations which may permit the working pf hy
draulic mines at places where there Is no
opportunity to Impound at or near the place of
operation. 'Â£,",*'.- ] , ' .Â»,- â¢ .â¢ !
Committee's Conclusions.
The cpmmittee reported, In answer to
a question as to whether hydraulic nam
ing would be permitted after the, Yuba
River barriers are constructed, that j as
licensed hydraulic mining is permitted
now there is no logical reason that can
be advanced to show that it will be re
strained after the Yuba -River barriers
shall have been completed; as conditions
will be improved by the added protection
thus given to the rivers below and to ad
jacent lands. The committee then called
attention to those who might have any
doubts concerning the accuracy . of this
general conclusion to a statement "that
has been often misquoted; contained ' in
the report to the War Department, trans
mitting the project of 1899."
This is that "the object sought to be
accomplished is the storage of the de
tritus now in the Yuba River and its trib
utaries, with a view to the improvement
of the rivers below and decidedly not with
a view of permitting unlicensed, indis
criminate- hydraulic mining at locations
above the impounding works."
On the basis of this presentation on the
part of the Government report the com
mittee argued as follows:
The recent convention of the Miners'
Association of California' had something
definite to say concerning the question of
hydraulic mining In, this State. In the
resolutions that were adopted the several
recommendations of â¢ the committees were
summarized, which was all that was pos
sible. The has a good idea of the
substance of the committee reports gen
erally, but late In -the afternoon of the
closing day of the convention, when. there
were so many other, matters then on hand,
Including the consideration, of the report
of the committee on resolutions and ac
tion thereon. and also the annual election
of the officers of the association, one're
port of great importance' and significance
was practically unnoticed. In the report
of the committee on debris, which was
submitted by Mr. Caminetti, were several
very 'interesting statements.

QUIT WHITE BREAD.
CctddNot GÂ«t Strength From It.
An EplscopaUan minister of Ellenville,
N. "I., who is interested not only in the
spiritual welfare of his congregation, but
la tbelr physical well-being also, eays:
"I can now do an' Immense amount of
work and feel no fatigue, for the reason
that I am using Grape-Nuts breakfast
food and have quit coffee entirely and am
using Postum Food Coffee.
Myself and family are all greatly Im-
proved in health- We have largely
abandoned the use of white bread. Up-
Â»aid of twenty-flve persons have changed
their diet on my recommendation. It is
glaJly given, because I know, from per-
sonal experience, whereof I speak."
It is a well-known fact that white
bread Is almost entirely composed of
starch and this is difficult of digestion by
many people, particularly those who have
weak intestinal digestion. The result of
the use of much white bread is a lack of
brain and nervous power to do mental
work and it also creates intestinal trou-
ble:!, because the excess of. starch fer-
raeats in the intestines and makes the
conditions right for the growth of mi-
crobes, whereas Grape-Nuts breakfast
food contains the needed starch, but in
a predigested form. That Is, It is trans-
formed uito grape sugar in the process of
manufacture and delivered In the pack-
a?â¬Â«, ready cooked, and In such shape
that it Is Immediately assimilated without
hard work of the digestive organs.
The food also contains the delicate par-
ticles of phosphate of potash, which, com-
bined with albumen, is used by nature to
ma.se the gray matter that must be In the
cells of the brain and the nerve centers
throughout the body, in order to give
strength and ability to â¢ stand long and
continuous work. Both the Posfura Food
Co:lee and Grape-Nuts are sold by all
first-class grocers. - â¢

SPOKANE, Oct. 26.-Offlcial tests of the
value of kindergarten training in the pub
lic schools were completed here to-day.
The tests were most complete, the stand
ing of about 3000 children in the eleven
schools haVing been ascertained. ' The " re
sult shows that in a general average of
studies, neatness, deportment and perse
verance the children who attended kinder
gartens before entering the public schools
lead the other children by but fifteen one
thousandths of one per cent.- The result
is a surprise to many local educators, who
believed the kindergarten children would
lead . by a heavy percentage.
On the other hand, the non-kinder
garten children lead by fifty-eight _ to
fifty-two in the grand average of tests by.
subjects. There are eleven schools, ani
ten subjects arc covered in each school.
The non-kindÂ«tgarten children lead in
language in six of the eleven- tchoels, In
arithmetic in seven, in writing in six, in
drawing in seven, in neatness of books in
eight, in deportment in seven, and iu
perseverance in six. .. _â¢ ;â¢ < j.-.

A PLOT, as daring and criminal as
was ever concocted by a felon in
stripes, has been exposed at San
QuentUi Prison. By the timely,
discovery of the plot the direc
tors of the prison will be able to save to
the farmers of the State the jute ba&
output of the mills at the prison. Fals?
affidavits made by alleged farmers and
presented by different firms and corpor
ations . who were supposed to act as
agents for purchasers of grain bags, have
been worked, on the prison officials until
certain firms in San Francisco carried and
sold large quantities of prison bags for
prices over 2 cents In advance of the
prison selling price. !
A determined effort wae made to corner
the whole output of the mill for the % f ol
io wing year by these " speculators, who
took advantage of a loosely constructed
law and sought to effect the corner by
simply tiling applications for the purchase
of bags in 2000 lots. Many of these appli
cations were made by bona fide farmers,
but orders calling for the entire product
of the mill put the directors upon their
guard. The .investigation that followed
showed that gross fraud existed among
most of the applications. The directors
have prepared the following circular ad
dressed to the grain producers of the
State, setting forth their position and thi
law governing the sale of the bags:
An unprecedented demand for grain bags
manufactured at San Quentin Prison set in
early during the present year before much \u25a0 ot
the season's crop was fairly in the ground.
Realizing that the demands would speedily.:
cover the entire output for the year the Prison
Directors during the month of January, 1901,
reduced the number of bags that would be sold
to a single producer from 6000, the former
limit to 2C00. But this did not serve as an
efficient check. At least two \u25a0 months before
an acre of wheat was harvested orders had
been filed for every bag on hand or to be
manufactured up to September 15.
Hundreds of Orders Declined.
' As a consequence hundreds of ,later orders,
had to be declined, as there was no opportunity
for filling them, and many farmers; have been
compelled to pay the high rates for grain bags
exacted by - those who controlled the market.
At the same time the terms of -the somewhat
locsejy. drawn law regulating the' sale of San
Quentin grain bags does not seem to allow the
Board of Prison Directors any discretion as to
the receipt of orders that' are presented in a
lejral manner. ". . -â¢ .\u25a0 . * â¢ \u25a0 ''â..,
The language of the statute is as follows:
"Section 1. It'shall-be the duty of the State
Board of Prison 'Directors from time, to time
to -fix' the price and to 'give public -notice of
The prison mill produces five million
bags a year. This year the bags sold at
the prison for $5.65 a hundred. Those
bags that were cornered by means of
bogus affidavits were sold to farmers who
would' have otherwise purchased them
from the prison for $7.50 a hundred. Some
hope is yet entertained that the guilty
parties -may be discovered. Every bale
of bags that leaves the prison is num
bered and a record is kept of who receives
it. In this way the ring of conspirators
may be captured.
Five Million Bags Yearly.
In "the event that orders so received exceed
the output of the mill for the year, they will
be scaled pro rata. It Is hoped that this plan
will give the farmers of the State a more
even chance to secure supplies of San Quentln
bags, and the courtesy of the press is solicited
to give it as wide publicity as possible so that
there may be no misunderstanding on the
part of grain growers. It will at least prevent
the danger of an immediate covering of the
output of the mill and the consequences certain
to follow it. Any suggestion from farmers
bearing on the question will be gratefully re
ceived by the San Quentin authorities.
When seen at his home to-night Di
rector James H. Wllklns said:
There Is no question but that fraud has been
attempted. Advantage has been taken of a
loosely drawn law and an effort has been made
to effect a corner in the Jute bag output of
the prison. Last September the orders were
so large that the board concluded to accept
no orders until the grain was In the ground.
According, to one reading 'of the law there Is
nothing to prevent filing of, applications for
bags that would tie up the output of the mills
for years to come. The board has had to act
arbitrarily in the matter in order to protect
the grain producers. -
No matter whether the bags went' to the
farmer or the speculators the State would lose
nothing. The Intent of the law, however, atid
the aim of the directors is to give "the grain
producers the benefit of buying direct from
the mill. I am eorry In one way that the
affair Is given publicity at this time as we
have taken steps that would have ultimately
led to the detection of the guilty parties. At
present while we are morally certain of the
guilt of purchasers we lack the necessary
proof.
I understand that the board has been threat
ened, with mandamus proceedings to compel It
to accept orders for bags In advance. If this
is done the courts will pass upon the law and
we will know, where we stand. I do not think
that this fraud has been . practiced further
back than the present year, that is, to any
extent. â¢ â¢
Orders May Be Scaled.
tstration, but preference will be given to those
from individual producers over orders that are
presented by farmers through large firms and
corporations.
the same at which Jute goods shall be sold by
the State, but at .no time shall the price fixed
be more than 1 cent per bag In excess of the
net cost of producing the same, exclusive of
prison labor. And it is made the duty of the
State Prison authorities to confine the sale of
jute goods to consumers direct, but no order
shall be filled for any one Individual or firm
during any one year for more than 5000 grain
bags except on request of the Warden and the
unanimous approval of the State Board of
Prison Directors. â¢
Sec. 2.- Demands for Jute goods by con-'
sumers shall be promptly filled In the order
In which they are made.- But when the sup
ply is short demands shall be registered at
the^pdson in the order of their arrival and
filled from the output of. the jute mill in the
order of their registration, provided that on
and after the 15th day of June of each year
by and with the conseitf of a majority of the
Board of Prison Directors the Warden may
nil orders for larger quantities to actual con
sumers as they may. In their judgment, deem
expedient; provided that orders of farmers
shall take precedence over all others; pro\'lded
further, that 10 per cent of the purchase price
shall accompany each order and the remain
ing portion must be paid upon delivery of the
goods.
Affidavits Must Be Made.
"Sec. 3. All orders for . Jute goods must be
accompanied by an affidavit setting forth that
the amount of orders contained in the or
der are for Individual and personal use of the
applicant, said affidavit to be subscribed and
sworn to before some Notary Public, or by the
Justice of the Peace residing In the township
in which the applicant resides; provided that
any applicant as heretofore provided for, : who
falsely and fraudulently procures Jute goods
under the provisions of this act shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor.
It seems perfectly clear that when legitimate
orders for^graln bags are presented within the
limits fixed the prison authorities have no op
tion save to receive ajjd file the orders. But
there is a question what may constitute a le
gitimate demand. For Instance, the board has
received within the past month numerous or
ders for the "coming season." There Is good
ground â¢ for the suspicion that if. .these were
accepted and registered every bag that can be
manufactured up to September. 1902, would be
immediately, covered and the plain purpose of
the law to protect the grain growers be utterly
defeated. The statute does not provide for
such a contingency, but it seems plain that if
the orders can be placed now for grain bags for
the season of 1902 there ls^no reason why the
output -of the San Quentln mill could not be
tied up for the next ten years. â¢
The" Board of Directors have 'therefore di
rected the warden to return all orders for bags
and checks accompanying them to the senders
until further notice. The â¢ board has further
determined to receive no orders for grain bags
prior to February 1, 1902, which is fixed a*
the opening of the bag year. All orders that
may be received will be opened on that date
and will have a common standing as to reg-

tinged with a faint yellow, the yellow
that ccmes with age, and the pattern was

intended it for just such a dainty bud as
Landers. The lace was made over a
1 white :511k foundation, excepting the neck
and 6l<jeves, which were unllned. The
dress was made exquisitely simple. There
was no relieving color, save a rosette of
pale pink tulle that was pinned to the left
side of the corsacre.

INCIDENTS OF THE FOOTBALL
GAME BETWEEN BERKE
LEY AND THE OLYMPICS.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen, which
were legislated out of existence recently
by the director s of the parent body of
the big athletic club, met last night for
the last time. The affair assumed ths
form of a banquet.
Much regret \vas expressed at the pass
ing of a club under whose colors raced on
this coast such men as E. C. Bald, Ot*3
Ziegler, C. R. Coulter, Allen Jones. E. R.
Russ, George Pope Fuller. E. O. Krag
ness, E. A. Bozio, C. L. Davla, W. k\

T. G. Splllane. L. C. Hunter, H. V. Scott.
G. H. btratton, William Mackle, Chester
Xiyiick. S. G. Scovern and others.
President Mullen presided over the
gathering last night. ' In all the responses
was a touch of sadness that the Olympic
Club Wheelmen had ceased to exist. The
club had always represented all that
stood for thorough spoitsmanship on tha
road and path, and the members coul<t
not Icok with complacency upon it being
wiped out in a moment. Graceful re
sponses were made by Charles Albert
Adams. L. C Hunter. George James. Her

speed In getting down on kicks and In
breaking up Interference.
The cardinal . rootera were out * in fu'.l

The Most Interesting
Game of the Year
on Stanford Field
"*<\u25a0Â» - ALIFORNIA defeated the Olyrri
il pic Club football team yesterday
\V J by a score of 6 t0 5 - Eacn eleven
made a touchdown, but Cadwala
der failed to kick the goal for the
Olympics, while Overall sent the pigskin
sailing true between the groal posts on the
California's try at goal.
The game was not fast, the field being
rather heavy from the rains, but at times
brilliant football was played.
Sherman, at half, kept the California
â¢,'rooters" on their toes after he* had
taken Whipple's place late in the second
half. Not many minutes were left to
play when he came into the game. Olym
pic had scored and was defending its own
goal In a manner that left little hope in
the souls of the California men. Cutter
punted across the center of the field
twenty yards into California . territory.
The ball fell into Sherman's arms, there
was a mix-up of players, and out of the
tangle came the little Berkeley man, run
ning at full speed. Straight down the side
line he -went, as Graves did at the fresh
man game. There were a half-dozen to
Interfere for himâ Duden. Albertson, Mini
and Womble being particularly effective
in blocking off the club players. No op
ponent could reach him and he sprinted
the seventy-five yards for a touchdown.
It was a great run. Sherman showed
himself to be both speedy and heady, and
he is likely to be a factor in this year's
intercollegiate contest. . - '
Olympics Claim a Foul. ..â¢: [
The Olympic players were not satisfied
with the manner in which th^ touchdown
was made, Parker, the Olympic end, was
heid, while the California men, In the In
terference, used their hands in-warding
taoklei's ort the runner. Referee Scott
called Umpire Coulter's attention to \u25a0 the
fouls, but Coulter had not seen them and
the touchdown was allowed.
Apart from Sherman's run and several
shorter ones equally as brilliant, the club
team had "rather the better of the argu
ment. They played a steadier game,
tumbled less and showed superiority in
the line, except at the end positions.
The California backs show improvement
anil Overall is punting -better' than ever.
His team had the better Of it in that de
partment of the Kame. \u25a0, ' \u25a0 . :
Gammon was tne star ground-gainer
for the club men. Seven minutes after the
beginning of play in the first half. Gam
mun tucKed tne ball under his arm and
started around end. Kmbick put Hudson
out of the piay, Duden was ta Ken caro of
by Parker, and Gammon had a clear Held
for a touchdown. His run was thirty-five
yards long. The try at goal was not diffi
cult, but Cadwulader was slow in kicking
and the line of California players blocked
the ball. .
A few minutes prior to this touch
down California had a narrow escape
from being scored against. Olympic had
kicked oft, and then had been given the
ball on the 25-yard lineâ the penalty for
a forward pass by California. Plunges
by Gammon, Cutter and l'lunkett put the
b:ill eight yards from the goat line, first
down. Three line bucks advanced the ball
but tour yards, the California line hold
ing like a stone- wall, and the ball went
to California four yards from the' goal
line.
Overall punted, presumably out of dan
ger, but Gammon, ran the ball in ten
yards and on the next play, made his great
run for a touchdown.
Try for Field Goal Pails. -..;' â¢'-
The kick-oft . for California, j of
course, sent the ball Into Olympic
territory, and It stayed .there dur
ing most of the remainder - of the half.
Neither side was able to .buck the line
steadily, the Olympic line proving par
ticularly stiff. Once, when California was
held, on the 25-yard line, Overall tried a
place kick for field goal, but the ball
went wide of the mark. Olympic then
punted to the center of the field.. â¢ Califor
nia ceuld make but, one yard in two
downs, and Overall punted 50 yards. The
ball failed to roll over the goal line, Cut
ter ran it In live yards and time for tha
first half was called, with the ball in
Olympic's possession, eight yards : from
goal in Olympic territory. , :
Early in the second half Overall made
20 yards on a fake kick, but -Womhl* had
held in the line and the ball i was . taken
back and given to Olympic, on the 20-yard
line. After two tries at center, Olympic
tried a drop-kick, by Cutter, at field goal.
The. ball* went low, skimming through the
crowd, and California got the ball on: the
20-yard line. â¢ There wqb : an \u25a0 exchange of

Oakland sent a man home in the second,
one in the fifth, two each in the seventh
and eighth and one in the ninth. The
score:
The same between Oakland and San
Francisco yesterday at Recreation Park
was called in the ninth innir.g. each team
havlnjj seven runs to their credit. The
Wasps were the last at bat and Pabst had
scored Hildebrand with a two-bagger,
making the score a tie. With two out.
Krug went to bat. The light was bad
and he took exception to Umpire Har
per's Judgment on balls and strikes. Har
per then, called the game, the tie score
standing.
Harper was again unfortunate In hav
ing- an unusual number of close decisions
to render. For once the Oaklands wera
not the greatest sufferers.
San Francisco started well. Wilson,
Hildebrand and Schwartz each hit safely,
11 11 ing the bases. Captain Pabst was the
next batter up and sent the ball over the
center Held fence, clearing the bases and
scoring four runs. This is the first time
liiis season such a thing has been' done.
The Wasps went out In one-two- three
order until the seventh, when Graham
scored. He made second on two wild
tnrows and scored on Wilson's single.
Two more runs were scored in the ninth.
In this inning- a -decision was rendered
which stirred the wrath of the spectators.
Two men were out and Graham was at
the bat. Shay stole second and third on

PRINCETON. N. J.. Oct. 26.â Princeton
defeated Lafayette here to-day by a
score of 6 to 0. The game was hard
fought and was marred only by fumbles
in the first half by both teams. Prince

throughout the game, while Lafayette
proved the stronger in line-bucking in
the first half, und Princeton a few points
the better In the second half.
â¢ANNAPOLIS. Mil., Oct. 26,-State Col
lege of -Pennsylvania defeated the Naval
Cadets here this afternoon by a score
of 11 to 6. The cadets defeated the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania last Monday and
were perfectly confident of winning this
game, but -were decidedly outplayed and
their touchdown was made on a fumble
by a Smtc player, while State made one
touchdown by straight hard football and
got into position for a try at goal by
steady rushing down the field.
CHICAGO. Oct.- Lt-Two brilliant runs,
one by Captain Davidson for forty-Jive
yards and one by Reynolds for thirty-five
>rards, together with a goal kicked by
Snook, netted a pcore of eleven points for
the University of Pennsylvania, to-day,
while the Chicago men were unable to
score. In the first half, Chicago having
kicked off and the ball having been re
turned to the center of the field, David
son smashed through center, stumbled,
recovered and then ran down the Held
without- interference for the first touch
down. Snook kicked .in easy goal.. The
second half was scarcely under way when
Reynolds, on a delayed pass, got the plg
sfcln'and'scurried'down the gridiron for
a second touchdown. He slid the last
three yards, with Sheldon clinging to his
loot. Snook missed the goal. The East

Neither side scored In the first half, and
while the ball was in Columbia's territory
during the greater part of the game, the
young New 1'orkers often played rhelr op
ponents to a standstill. The Yale. giants
were held for downs three times. More
over, Columbia frequently made the nine
ty-flve-yard line, only to lose possession of
the ball there by fumbling entirely incon
sistent with the general faultlessness of
her team play. Columbia also sacrificed
much advantage by a surprising disposi
tion toward off-side play. Three times
they were penalized ten yards for this of
fense, and the distance awarded Yale
aided materially in keeping the ball in the
enemy's teritory.
The contest throughout -was more stub
bornly and fiercely fought than many an
othsr so-called "big" game played in New
Haven. Columbia's rush line occasioned
much comment by its apparent stone-wall
solidity early in the game, and these same
linesmen were able often to open up gap-
Ing holes in the stalwart line of Yale.
There was more or less slugging and
roughing, and on one occasion the rival
players were momentarily locked in little
disputes that must have blossomed into
free fights had not cooler heads prevailed.
ITHACA. N. Y., Oct. 26.â On Percy field
lo-day Cornell defeated Oberlin College
by a score of 29 to 0. In the early part
of the game Cornell's defense evinced a
weakness It has not shown before this
season, but as the contest progressed the
line assumed' stone- wall proportions and
the visitors could gain little ground. The
notable changes In Cornell's team~were
Hunt, who went from right guard to
tackle, and Finucane, who was substi
tuted in the early part of the game for
Coffin at right halfback. Brewster was
at quarterback.

Harvard also had a' great deal of luck,
five times fumbling the ball, but recover
ing it instantly.
At tha end of the first -half -the Indiana
wouJ probably., have had scored if time
had not been called, as thoy had advanced
the bail from midflcld to Harvard's
eighty-yard line by a series of trick plays
which proved very ' effective. The Har
vard team showed greater spirit and more
team play than at any time this season.
Marshall played a brilliant game at quar
terback, and made several good dodging
runs after catching punts. The whole line
played well and opened good holes for the
runners. Harvard was only once held for
downs.
NEW HAVEN, Cor.ri., Oct. 26.â Yale Uni

afternoon by the score of IV to 5. Two
touchdowns were Yale's portion, but
neither of them was converted into a goal.
Columbia was unable to carry the ball
across Yale's goal line, but Captain Mor

Cazneau was sentenced to four years in
San Quentln August 20, 1895, for burglary,
for having entered the residence 1417 Du

family, his grandfather having been a dis

Cazneau is also supposed to have held
up and ; robbed Frank Demartinl . about

Charles Romano, a barber, living at 744
Broadway, had almost reached his home
shortly after midnight last Saturday,
when a man -with a. mask over his. face
pointed & revolver at- him and ordered
him to throw up his hands. While the
robber was trying to extract Romano's
watch from his pocket Romano grappled
with him and grabbed hold of the revol
ver, his forefinger getting behind the
hammer. The robber tried ; twice to fire,
but each time the hammer fell upon Ro
mano's nnger and the weapon did not ex
plode. During tbeystruggle the robber's
mash? fell off and Romano recognized Caz
neau, who finally succeeded in breaking
away from Romano, leaving behind his
mc^k, which was later found by Police
man Peshon. Romano -again identified
Casneau in the prison yesterday after
noon. A peculiarity of the hold-up wÂ»s
that Cazneau got a friend who lives on
Filbert street to borrow Romano's revol
ver on the day previous, bo that his in
tended victim would be unarmed.
The detectives, after working on the case
for a few days, were satisfied that Cazneau
was the robber about whom complaints
had been made and copies of his photo
graph from the "Rogues' Gallery", were
circulated throughout the State, as they
had ascertained that he had left the city.
Cazneau formerly worked in the sugar re
finery at Crockett and Constable Moiles
discovered him there yesterday' morning
and brought him to the city.
The masked robber who has-been ope
rating on the Barbary Coast has been ar
rested through the persistence and
shrewdness of Detective McMahon and
Riordan.. He is Eugene Cazneau, an eÂ£

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â The Ameri
can hog has a European rival. Denmark
has come into the field as a producer and
exporter, of hogs and hog products, with
;a growth at least interesting, if not sug
gestive, to American producers of a com
modity whose export value grew from $84,
908,693 in 1891 to $119,961,503 in 1901. These
figures show the total value of hog prod-,
ucts - exported from the United States in
1891 and 1901, respectively, the details for
1901 being: Lard, J46.5C0.148; bacon, $37,
499, 026; hams, $22,842,778; salted and pickled
pork, $9,926,633; fresh pork. $2,424,537, and
canned pork, $708,381. a
The fact that - hog products form the
largest single item in the exportations of
the United States, having exceeded last
year by $2,000,000 those of manufactures of
iron ., and steel, whose exports \u25a0 have; at
tracted so much attention, lends -interest
to some facts which have just reached
the Treasury, Bureau of Statistics regard
ing the remarkable 1 development of the
hog-packing industry of Denmark. This
information . shows that the number of
head of swine in Denmark has increased
from 301.000 in 1861 to 771,000 in 1881 and
1,165,000 ln 1898, the latest year for which'
statistics- are available. . ".^
The prohibition of ; the importation of
live hogs into Germany and the United
Kingdom, which -countries were Den
mark's principal customers ; in tills line,
resulted in the - establishment of slaugh
ter-houses in Denmark and the increase
in the production of Danish bacon and
hams in recent years have been phenome
nal. The exports of hams -and bacon from
Denmark have grown from 9,120,000 Danish
pounds in 1878 to 129,700,000 Danish pounds
in 1898, the value increasing- from 4,110,000
kroner in 1878 to 47,080,000 \u25a0 kroner | in 1898,
the value of the kroner, being 26.8 cents. <
, As a consequence of the change from the
export of live swine to that of slaughtered
animals, the slaughter-houses have risen
to the greatest importance in '. Denmark
during the last, ten or fifteen; years. While
formerly^the slaughter-houses belonged-, to
private individuals, i a large â¢ number \u25a0''of
joint and co-operative slaughter-houses
have been established during -this period.
This movement commenced- in 1887 on ac
count of the German importation prohibi
tion, when it became necessary -to kill a
considerable number of swine which were
formerly sent to Germany, alive for sala
in England. . _ -
- The number cf head / of swine exported
to Germany -in the year * before ' the . pro
hibition was enforced amountea'.to more
than a quarter of a million, . and thua
there was; suddenly plenty of work for
several . slaughter-houses. - In ; 1887 ione co â¢
operative slaughter-house ' was \u25a0!-.estab
lished, ln 1888 : seven, â¢ and â¢ rapid " progress
was made during the following .years
with regard to establishing, new slaugh
ter-houses and to the quantity of bacon
they produced. . ,- . : = l
\u25a0 There are now twenty-five ' co-opera tlv.j
slaughter-houses ln \u25a0 - Denmark. â¢-; which In
1899 killed 'about 729,000 head of swine at
a value of about $8,000,000," and about 22,450
head ' of dattle ?â¢ for '- export at a value of
about 3,500,000 kroner. ..The largest slaugh
ter-houses killed from 1 58,000 . to 61,000 pigs
in 1899. and the smaller from 9000 to 10,000.
In 1 1897- 1 wenty-cne slaughter-houses :. were

. After reviewing the growth of exports
of manufactures in leading articles, he
says: . "That the United Kingdom makes
such a poor showing in competition with
the United States Is due almost entirety
to the use of more perfect and. more eco
nomical machinery in this country. By
improvements in methods ofmanufacture
and close attention to the wants- of buy
ers there should be no difficulty in com
peting with the United States. As re
gards heavy steel goods such as rails,
structural materials, etc., the abundance
and cheapness of raw material in the
United States makes competition more
difficult. \u25a0 For finished articles -such as
machinery, etc., it is more- a question of
economy of manufacture, and design than
In the first cost^ of \u25a0'"material. In' this
country of high. wages. and. in many cases
long railway, carriage the .only, way to be
able to compete with other countries is to
cut down expense's as much as possible by
the -use of labor _savlng machinery and
general economy. If this is possible in
America it ought to be equally possible in
other compet|ng countries."
The report also discusses' the growth of
the export trade from the United States
to Japan, which, it says, "is becoming
an important importing country of Ameil
can goods." The report then quotes tables
showing the total imports, of Japan and
the total from the, United St,ates and
United Kingdom, respectively, at qmn :
quennial periods from 1SS1. It shows that
the imports into Japan from the United
States have risen from 1,781,108 yen In 1SS1
lo 62,761.196 yen in 1900; and that imporzs
Into Japan from the United Kingdom
have only grown from 16,364,740 yen in 1881
to 71.638,219 yen in 1900. Thus the United
States exports to Japan were in 1900 more
than thirty-five times as large as in liiSl,
while those of the United Kingdom to
Japan were less than five times as large
as in 1SS1.
Commenting upon this phenomenal
frowth in the exports . from the United

we make a comparison between the quan
tities of certain merchandise exported
this year with" those exported the year
previous many a useful lesson- may be

Lagori and Risso started from the foot
of Regent street' in a leaky skiff for the
Bay Farm Island side to hunt geese. Be
fore 1 they had rowed half way across the
channel their craft became waterlogged.
The boys, overcome with fright, turned
the frail vessel over and both were thrown
into the water. Young Risso seized a life
preserver. that had been in" the boat and
clung, to it. Lagori "clambered upon the
capsized craft and Risso soon did like
wise. The youths yelled at the tops of
their voices and attracted the attention
of Christensen and Horn, who immedi
ately put off from the beach In a white
hall and took the drenched and. weakened
lads aboard and brought them to land.
Risso lost a valuable gun when the boat
capsized. He resides in San Fpanqisco;
Lagori lives on Calhoun street in this city.
Christensen and Horn, the rescuers, are
both residents here, Christensen living at
855 Laurel street and Horn at S91 Oak
street.

SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 23.â Considerable
excitement has been. caused in Corte Ma
dera by the discovery, of a gold-bearing
quartz ledge upon the property of Jame3
S. McCue. Sometime ago McCue started
to sink a well. The formation through
which the boring was done was exceed
ingly hard, water waa scarce and the well
was about, to be abandoned when the
workmen broke into a ledge of quartz.
Crude tests showed that It carried gold
In considerable quantities and McCue
turned his well Into a prospect shaft and
had the work continued. " â¢â¢
A crosscut showed that thft- vein le about
ten feet wide, between two walla of slate
and limestone. Another shaft has been
sunk about 100 feet from the first and the
ledge has again been found. "McCue said
to-day: â¢ ' â¢ â¢'>.*'â¢
"I Delleve that It 13 a good prospect.
From assays made from samples of the
rock it will run from $8 to $10 per ton. It
is free milling. This, .together with the
fact that the ore exists. in a large body,
will* make the venture a paying one. I
am . so convinced of ltd -value, that I will
shortly have several carloads of the
Quartz worked."
No lots in Corte Madera are for sale
now. Owners are hanging on in the hope
that a quartz ledge meanders through
their property.

pig damages are asked of the San .Lo
renzo Water, Company by Hunt Brothers
Company, the canning firm, and twenty
four insurance companies, who sustained
the loss of $124,496 98 by fire on account of
the alleged failure of the defendant to
carry out its contract with the plaintiffs
for a water supply.. The water company
is charged with having. delayed the mat
ter of extending its pipe line until a great
fire came and wiped out the entire fruit
canning and can manufacturing plant of
the Hunt Brothers Company at Haywards,
the destroying element having laid many
buildings and properties low on April 12
last, almost in the midst of the fruit pre
serving season. 'â¢ ' -. \u25a0â¢\u25a0 - .:
According to the complaint the plant
was worth at the time of the fire J125.000,
consisting of the . cannery, . a warehouse,
machinery, implements and seventy-four
cottages occupied by the workmen. These
properties were damaged to the extent of
$104,486 98. In addition to this amount
$25,000 is asked for loss of gains and pro
fits occasioned by the destruction of the
plant, less $5000. representing the loss that
might have ensued had the water com
pany carried out its contract. On the de
stroyed property there was $91,221 42 in
surance, $13,275 56 worth being uninsured.'
The plaintiffs assert that the loss was
not sustained through any fault of theirs,
as ample means had been taken to fight
fire on the premises. It is claimed that
an agreement existed between the parties
to the suit by which the water company
was bound to run a six-inch main to the
cannery premises to which was to be con
nected a hydrant and service pipes. The
pipes and hydrant were placed, but they
were not connected, in spite of remon
strances from the canning people that it
be done. The defendant promised in
March to make the necessary connections,
but up to the time of the fire had failed to
carry out its agreement. ..-"''-"; .'"'\u25a0

Those who are marked for early retire
ment are Bailiff Sam Mitchell and R. B.
Phillips. Both of these men will reach
the age limit very shortly, but they are
now eligible for retirement under the dis
ability section of the retirement law.
When Mitchell is retired the duties of
bailiff of the Police Court will be assigned
to Police Clerk Louis Agnew, and thÂ«
man who takes Mitchell's place will be
assigned to a beat, thus giving the depart
ment another active man.
The reorganization of the Oakland Po
lice Department is not going to stop with
the dropping of the five men who wera
removed in accordance with the ordinance
of the City Council reducing the force by
five men. It is very evident that the pres
ent Board of Police and Fire Commission
ers intends to make the changes that they
deem necessary for the benefit of the de
partment, and the changes are not going
to stop with what has already been done.
The Commissioners say that -'the
changes that were made this week were
not in any way dictated by politics, and
that when the men were dropped from
the department they considered only its
pood and wished to be as far removed
Irom politics as possible.
So the dropping of the five men last
Wednesday night will be followed by the
filing of charges against several more offi
cers and the retirement as fast as possible
of ail of those who have reached the agÂ«
of retirement. Charges will be filed
against some of those . who it was
thought would be dropped under the ordi
nance reducing the force, and those will
probably include Patrolmen Sill and Me-
Cloud.

HENPECKED HUSBANDS.
By MARGARET L. BRIGGS.
RIGHTS RESERVED.)
- While reading some papers the other day I happened across these sen-
tences, and they have a world of wisdom in them: "For some reason tho
martyrs of our, day. are scorned rather than admired. "We are prone to think
that martyrdom is a lack of backbone in the martyr." The article referred
to henpecked husbands and accused them of lack of courage.
.- As a class henpecked husbands are more misunderstood than any other
persons in existence. The wife will make a fuss if her husband comes horns
late; she will object to his instructions to the children; she will ridicule his
friends until they no longer visit each other. Step by step the woman will
narrow her husband's horizon, for the unfortunate man desires peace above
all else and he will. do anything to secure It. He tries hard to do what hÂ»
thinks will please- his wife. , He never stops a minute to chat with his
friends, but coines home day after day. as regular as clockwork. He rarely
speaks except to answer questions. After dinner he retires to some corner
where he hopes to. pass a quiet hour. He would love to smoke, but his wife
does not like the smell of tobacco in the house. So he gets what consolation
he can from his newspaper. Yet this husband, whose entire life has been
crushed, will only say of his wife: "Poor girl; she isn't well. I knew if sha
weren't sick she wouldn't mind things so much." "With him it is not lack of
backbone that makes him a martyr, butcrnsideration for his wife. He must
make allowances for her because she is sick, and he does it even though it
changes his living to mere existing. \u25a0
â¢ His wife, oh the other hand, like 'their acquaintances, never considers
herself sick, in that charitable way her husband has. She is merely In that
frame of mind where she knows she has rights and will see that she gets
them, no matter.'what happens. She is mistres3 of the house and there
her word is law; she treats her husband like a slave, and before long he is
oneâ a slave who follows her lead blindly, without any Interest or will of
his own. 'T
The. husband is rightâ his wife is sick. She is sick with some one of
those female ', disorders which, while perhaps not showing itself in actual
pain, keeps a woman continually wrought up and excited; and with her the
excitement has taken the form of Insisting upon having her own way la
everything. What this: woman needs is to take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, and the disagreeable traits in her husband to which she so
much objects will not seem so bad as she thought them. Mrs. Pinkham's
medicine will quiet her, will make everything more cheerful, and happiness
will reign in that household.
There, are other martyrs of our day,' howeverâ the women who suffer
year, after year, yet uncomplainingly go about their work, considering It
their duty, no matter how" they feel. Many of them, when the pain in the
back~ seemed unbearable, when they suffered in agony for hours during their
monthly illness, would go to the family physician. But usually they are wo-
men of great modesty and cannot bring themselves to tell a male doctor
the whole Ijrath about their aches and pains. So they secure no relief, and
go on day after day, knowing that each night will but find the pain greater.
" These silent sufferers are the real martyrs of our day. But with them,
too, there is no need for their martyrdom.' Let \them write to Mrs. Pink-
ham at Lynn, Mass. They can tell her. all, every detail of their illness, about
every pain, because she is a .woman and understands all the ills of women*
No man ever sees the letters that go to^ner, and these martyrs can safely tell
the secrets they would hate to whisper to a man. No woman need fear to
tell. Mrs. Pinkham is ready with- her sympathy, ready with her advice. All
these martyrs may be sure they need suffer no longer if they will but do
as Mrs. Pinkham tells themâ no more pains in the side, no more backache,
no more headache. Mrs. Pinkham's medicine cures them all, cures them
surely and cures them for good.
I do hope these silent sufferers will go to her and be martyrs no longer.

The briquette, as most people hav-j
learned, is a compressed cake of coal
screenings bound together by chemically
treated oil. The finished product is clean
and easy to handle, which is primarily a
distinct advantage over coal. The cost of
j the fuel does not exceed that of coal and
the heat efficiency is very much greater,
so that in the long run its expense is
materially less.
One important factor In the success oÂ£
j the briquette is that its use does away
i with the clinkers and with sifting. The
chemists who spent years of labor in the
effort to secure a fuel which would meet
with the approval of the public succeedeJ
in manufacturing a product which is al
most wholly combustible and, consa
quently, there Is but little ash left from
the burning of briquettes. With all thede
advantages it seems only reasoriable to
conclude that the venture will meet with
deserved success.
France, 'Germany, England and other
European countries have been using cer
tain forms of briquettes in their navies
for several years. American ingenuity
has been at work trying to improve on
these fuels. A factory lor the manufac
ture of briquettes was established a:
Chicago some time ago and the one a;
Stockton is the second of its kind in the
United States. The people who are at the
head of the Tesla enterprise resolved to
surpass all predecessors, and accordingly
hired chemical experts, who conducted
exhaustive experiments in briquette mak
ing. An article much superior to any
thing hitherto manufactured was at last
secured and the factory, at Stockton was
built.
The new fuel was first introduced into
the interior towns experimentally, and its
reception was so cordial that the bay
cities were next given the opportunity to
make a test of the invention. Ten car
loads of briquettes caine to Oakland
about a month ago. They were speedily
sold and a demand for more arose a*<
once. Since that time a great quantity
of the product has been brought to this
section and disposed of, everywhere giv
ing the greatest satisfaction. What its
future will be is, of course, decided by
its initial success.
California is ever ready to encourage
those ventures which are bound to put
her forward In the race of the States for
pre-eminence. When her people fully
realize the general advantages derived
from the manufacture of briquettes their
adoption as a fuel is assured everywhere
Briquettes are made from coal reduced
to small particles and combined with oil.
of which there is such an abundance in
this State. The process of manufacture
Is patented from start to finish and the
field for sale is as wide as the continent.
The final and complete success of the
industry is, therefore, a matter of con
siderable importance to the people of the
Pacific Coast.
The principle involved In the successful
manufacture of briquettes is to attain the
greatest caloric power with the least
possible expenditure of combustibles
Coal ordinarily in burning sets free a
larpe proportionate quantity of gas^s
which do not give forth heat. In conse
quence of the imperfect chemical process,
clinkers are formed and numberless bits
of coal are not consumed at all. Scien
tists estimate that about half of the heat
which mlerht be utilized Is thus loM.
This difficulty is to a great extent obvi
ated in the combustion of briquettes. I*
is improbable that chemical research will
ever succeed in saving every particle of
heat in fuels for domestic use, but the
briquette makers have done more towar.1
this pnd than lias been previously ac
complished. Careful combination of the
ingredients prevents any such alarming
waste as that experienced in the burning
of coal. The hydrocarbons or volatilt*
gases sire made to perform their duties
and satisfactory results are secured.
It is thus seen that the new product
which Is rapidly beinsr introduced Into our
homes establishes its success on solid
scientific principles. That the hundreds
vÂ«hfÂ» have alreadv been given the oppor
tunity to avail themselves of the use of
hriouettÂ«Â»s are agreeably surprised by
their advantasr.s and have nermaiently
pdoptM them for fuel is s'irelv a criterion
for th* future. Any kind of a s*ovp i.Â»

in its favor. Interest in the, new product

Mayor Phelan sent a communication to
the Board of Supervisors yesterday , in
which he recommends that 'a bond election
for the construction of. new schoolhouses,
a new hospital and a sewer system be
called in the month of December. His
Honor also ' requests that the Board of
Public . Works be called upon to furnish
plans for the Improvements. The com
munication follows: .'
/ SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25, 1901.
To the Honorable, the Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San .Francisco â
Gentlemen: The Board of Supervisors two
years ago declared that the public convenience
and necessity required the construction of new
schoolhouses, a new hospital and an intercept
ing sewer system, and the people at an elec
tion held December 29, 189J, . voted in favor
of issuing bonds for the construction of. these
improvements. Subsequently, the Board of Su
pervisors was restrained from proceeding by a
suit brought in the Superior Court which was
decided pro forma in favor of the validity of
the bonds, but the judgment was reversed in
the Supreme Court. - i â¢
It Is now necessary, in order to construct
echoolhouses. sewers and- an hospital, to sub
mit the proposition at an election to the peo
ple, which I suggest- should be done some time
in the month of â¢' December next. As a pre
liminary to this proceeding I recommend your
honorable board, as required by the charter,
to call upon the Board of Public Works to fur
nish plans and sfpecincations for these needed
Improvements. Respectfully submitted,
JAMES D. PHKLAN, Mayor.

NEW YORK, Oct. 26.â There was a hesitat
ing. Irregular etock market to-day until the
appearance of the tank statement on the tape.
The unexpected increase in the caeh reserve
cf the barks of $l.E92.900 prompted the bears
to cover their ehort lines and rally the mar
ket genera'.ly to above last night's figures, al
though the net changes generally will be seen
to be Insignificant. There was positive Inde
pendent strength in Missouri Pacific, which
advanced it 2 points ebove last night. There
was no news to explain the movement, and
their eynuiathelic effect upon allied stocks
was slight. People's Gas made a good recov
ery from recent weakness. Â£t. Paul was actlvt
and fluctuating and received the full benefit of
<*Â»f late overlnr. Amalgamated Copper was
Â»?7Â»vy icrcughiut. with news of the shutting
j''4*n of the company's tr.ines and In the late
rfeVMngs the stock broke V&c under last night,
interrupting the recovery elsewhere and mak
ing the cl jE'.ngr Irregular. The source of : the
teceipt of caeh by the banks Is a mystery,
es known moxtments of money Indicated a
Iocs cf upward of $2.Â£00,000 for the. week. The

Surplus. $14,713,175; decrease $752,600.
NEW YORK. Oct. 26.â The Financier says:
It is noteworthy that since September 20 the
sub-treasury has absorbed from, the banks
through the fiscal operations "of the Government
$1<S,276,4CO and moreover these operations last
week resulted in a greater drain froni the
banks than for any week since the above date.
It would seem" likely that the drain will con
tinue important at least for the remainder of
the year. The effect of these withdrawals from
the . treasury by the banks will be ' to some
extent counteracted In the near future by pay
ments for gold received at Pacific Coast points,
of which /gold there is now about $4,500,000 on
deposit awaiting transfer. There appears,
however, to be a prospect for the shipment of
gold to Europe, In order to relieve the mone
tary tension In London end on the Continent,
which shipment may have a decided Influence
on bank reserves tending to absorb the new
supplies of gold noted above. The surplus re
serve is how about $8,000,000 higher than It
was a year, ago and some good judges of the
situation feel convinced that the movement of
money to the West for crop purposes is nearly
ended. With the drain of money -for crop
purposes reduced to a minimum, the only
menace to the surplus reserve will be the. fis
cal operations cf the Government and the
movement of gold to Europe.

The Economiste Francais estimates that the
shrinkage in valuation of Russian enterprises
in two years is Â»iot leÂ»s than 60 per cent,
which would represent' losses to French in
vestors and speculators of $200,000,000. The
long process of liquidation in Germany also
continues, following the collapse from specu
lative inflation. The maturity of obligation at
the year's end in those two countries and
Great Britain's continued necessities for the
conduct of military affairs In South Africa
Indicate a strained period at that time, which
Is likely to be reflected over the whole finan
cial world. As to Immediate money conditions
in New York, lhÂ» Government surplus is mak
ing renewed demands upon the market, now
that Government bond redemptions have
ceased, the receipt of over $2,000,000 Australian
pold this week havins failed to offset this
drain. â¢
Railroad bonds have been in improved de
mand at advancing- prices.
United States refunding 2s declined % and
old 4s % per cent. The 3s advanced % above
last week's . closing call. - .
The movement was Initiated In the Chicago
and Northwestern stocks, shifting thence into
the Vanderbilts generally, then Into St. Paul,
Union and Southern Pacific and then into. the
coalers. The industrials \u25a0 and specialties have
moved independently,, as is usual in periods of
irregularity in the general market. A notable
feature of the market was the evident pre
dominating professional character of the opera
tions. Commission houses which upually
opeiate on orders from the general speculative
public have been conspicuously In the back
ground during the week. Brokerage houses
usually employed by the great financial inter
ests In the street have executed large orders
on both sides of the market, leaving' the un
informed public confused as to whether those
interests are committed to the long or ebort
side of the market.
Doubt and uncertainty. In fact, are still the
prevailing sentiment in speculative circles.
Some of the buying has been attributed to
progress toward a settlement of the Northern
Pacific controversy. If insiders have bought
stocks for that reason it is on information of
which the public is kept in ignorance. The
actual developments show a condition of that
controversy so far from settlement as to prom
ise a prolonged period of - negotiation, even
with the best Intentions for final peace of
the parties In interest. That negotiations are
In actual progress it- clear, but it is also clear
that these negotiations are now first under
taken on a subject which Wall street assumed
was definitely settled when Mr. Morgan an
nounced the members he had chosen to balance
the Northern Pacific board of directors. The
various statements given out on authority of
President Hill of the Great Northern and of
the Harriman-Kuhn-Loeb interests clearly
show divergent views and the holding to them
with determination. As contrasted with Mr.
Morgan's expressed conviction that the North
ern Pacific board contains within Itself all the
elements to assure a settlement fair and satis
factory to all interests, comes President Hill's
suggestive assertion that Great Northern, as
Joint guarantor of the Burlington purchase
bonds, is to be a factor in the settlement as
well as the contending Interests among the
actual stockholders- in Northern Pacific Uf-elf.
The Hill interests have insisted upon their
contention that Northern Pacific preferred is
to be retired in accordance with the power
vested in the company under the reorganiza
tion plan. The effect of this would be to oust
the Harrlman-Kuhn-Loeb interests from their
control, which is through preferred stock hold
ings, and leave the Morgan-Hill majority of
the common stock in control of the company.
The Union Pacific party is equally insistent
that their control of thÂ» disputed property is
not to be relinquished. " The recent buying of
Northern Pacific preferred is supposed to be
by this party. It is admitted that numerous
legal and technical obstacles exist to the ad-
Iuf-tment of ownership of a railroad company
by competing on parallel lines. In Its bare
outlines it eeems clear, therefore, that many
difficulties still exist in this puzzling problem.
Until they are definitely, cleared up a depress
ing factor will overhang the stock market. Im
portance is attached to the money disturbance
In foreign markets, as bearing on the large
foreign credits which have been us*d to carry
the large holdings of Northern Pacific ever
since the lockup in May. Repayments of these
credits have continued to sustain the foreign
exchange market this week, as for some time
past. The course of the loan account of New
York banks show that this burden 1r shifted
upon domestic credit Institutions, waiting upon
the Northern Pacific settlement for relief. The
usual fall Inflow of gold to this country Is
thereby Interrupted, except as the Australian
remittances can be substituted. The cal'ilng
home of French cf edits seems to be for . the
purpose of meeting heavy losses incurred by
French capital by over-investment in Russian
industrials. .
After falling into a lethargic condition early
in the week, the stock market developed a de
gree of activity and strength later. The buy
ing, which was responsible for this advance,
was large and concentrated in its source and
congested in a few stocks, shifting from day
to day from one group to another.
ol Germany shows a recuperation in cash re
sources of over $12,000,000. with a reduction of
loans and contraction of note issues of about
equal amounts, but sterling exchange declined
in Berlin again to-day, indicating continued
pressure, of gold there. There remains some
requirements to be filled at New York for re
mittances to London on account of subscrip
tions to the issue of consols, an Installment on
which is due November 7. The question of
gold exports from New York next week is,
therefore an open one.

responsive cables started the selling, Decem
ber opening -a shade to %<3%c lower at 71%
Â©71%c. Drouth news still continued to j ar
rive from Argentina, but with no response at
Liverpool this had little effect. Opposed against
this ! slight bearish; factor .was 'the news of
relief froni the drouth- in" the -Southwest and
Information that as soon as the flax crops
were out. of the way the Northwestern move
ment would begin again. To this wan added
proof in the way of increased Northwestern
receipts ' to-day. On these conditions Decem
ber sagged off to 71%c, helped by heavy liqui
dation by one or two prominent \u25a0 local bulls.
Near the end of the short session, \u25a0, however,
news of shipments for Russian ports brought
on a reaction and -.shorts, covered, which
brought December back to Its higher opening
price, closing easy. %c lower, at 71%@71%c.

year, are given as follows: Calif ornia.

167,026. '
There is less development work going on
In California- than there was some months
ago. Owners of oil properties who are not
compelled by the terms of contracts to
push work are waiting for the, combine
to get. into working shape. The date of
the actual beginning of the operations of
tho Associated Oil Company may not be
many months hence. The stockholders of
tne several companies will have all the
bearings of fthe combination thoroughly
explained to them by their directors when
they come together to finally determine
what they will do. A meeting of the
stockholders of the. Reed Crude Oil Com
pany has been called and will be held
early next month.
The rails of the Sunset Railroad have
been laid for the entire distance. Mixed
trains will run over the line until the traf
fic warrants the separate running of pas
senger and freight trains. Extensive de
velopment in the Sunset district Is now
expected to take place. ; ,
General activity is reported in the Fill
more and Santa Paula oil fields In Ven
tura County.
Owners Wait Developments.
It is reported that the new contract
made by the Santa Fe Railroad Company
for'OHis at considerably higher prices
than were named in the old one. This
would seem to indicate the belief of the
railroad people that the price will go still
higher^ which is the general opinion of
all observers of the trend of the oil in
dustry'and of the Interests more or less
bound up with it. '
A scheme for an ambitious combination
Is reported to be in incubation in the
Kaet. This has been given the name of
the Western Oil Men's Association. The
headquarters, are at Toledo, Ohio. The
arnounced purpose of this organization
is to -bring into co-operation the' produc
ers in the petroleum .fields of the United
Slates,' Canada and Mexico. The States
mentioned as likely to, be included in the
organization are Ohio, Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, California, Texas, Colorado, Wy
oming, Kentucky, Kansas and Louisiana.
Only a vague Idea of what the project
actually amounts to or what It signifies
ha? as yet been given currency.
Three companies of Glasgow capitalists
are reported ,to have been recently en
gaged In getting leases in Barren County,
Krrtucky, of what are supposed by them
to; be oil lands. Leases have been pur
chased to about 30,000 acres. There are
wells, in the county that have been operat
ed for some years, but they are small pro
ducers. :,;'J ..--.-
While there are . no new developments
to report In connection with the work of
the Associated Oil Company, othsrwlse
known as the combine of producing com
panies in the Kern and McKlttrick fields,
the promoters appear to be satisfied with
the progress they are making. It is no
tlcable that certain papers that were opÂ«
posed to the combination when it was
first reported in The Call to be a success
are now saying that- It is a good thing.
Since the company took shape the price
of oil has advanced.
â¢While the refineries are thus in line to
help the oil producers to a market, the
other causes' that 1 lead 7 to -a demand for
the fuel oil of California are active. The
fuel has been Introduced In the mines of
tha mother lode in Amador County, to
some extent, and the use of It will un
doubtedly increase in the/ next year. . It
has largely supplanted the coal mined in
Amador County. The principal: competi
tion is now with wood. Five companies
are arranging to carry out tfre contracts
for. the supply of oil : for the ! reclamation
districts on the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers.
Tanks for '2500 barrels are in construc
tion at Antioch, which will be filled from
the oil cars, and a barge with a capac
ity of 2500 barrels will carry the oil to
where it is required for use. The Bup
positlon is that the reclamation districts
alone will use from 30,000 to 40,000 barrels
of oil a year at the beginning.
Combine Makes Progress. . â¢
There Is talk Id Southern California
about a large increase in the capacity of
the oil refineries in Los Angeles, which
will tend to consume the crude oil and
to make a market. . At Bakersfleld the
Dupage Oil and Refining Company has
been incorporated, with Bakersfleld as
the principal place of business. At Los
Angeles =the Franklin Oil and Refining
Company has been : incorporated. If Is
announced that the purpose of this com
pany is to acquire the Franklin refinery
In Los Angeles and to operate it. Ac
cording to' the accounts that come from
the south the American Refinery in Los
Angeles will soon. reopen its doors. - '
The' Pacific . Refining Company, which
has started to build a refinery on the
main line of the Santa Fe, just outside
of the city limits of Bakersfield, will
have a dally capacity of 900 barrels when
it is completed. Most significant of all
the refining schemes is, of course, ;that
of the Standard Oil Company, which will
operate on a large scale on the shores of
the bay of San Francisco.

Everything went awry in the examin
ation into the Nome contempt cases yes
terday morning before Commissioner
Heacock. Attorneys waited for witnesses
that never came, and clashed at every
opportunity offered. Amicus Pillsbury
and Francis J. Heney livened up proceed
ings in a tilt and Judge Maguire helped
to fan the fiery tempers to the blazins
point.
Thomas J. Geary was again put on tha
stand at the opening of tne morning sen
sion. After Heney had asked a few ques
tions in cross-examination the witness
was delivered into Pillsbury's hands. The
amicus curiae went over the whole of
Geary's statement made In court during
the previous day. He tried to show thac
Geary had certain meetings with Mc-
Kenzie on the day of his arrest, and tried
to fasten upon him a series of malfeas
ances in the matter of advice relative to
the disposition of the gold dust.
When Geary retired from the stand
Pillsbury called for Deputy Marshal
Burnham, who Pillsbury thinks will tes
tify that Noyes and McKenzie and Geary
had a conference after the arrest of the
latter. Burnham could not be located,
and in order to refute possible testimony
to this point Judge Maguire wanted to
put on Judge Noyes, so he could be re
lieved from, the responsibility of further
attendance. Pillsbury objected, so Noyc-*
did not go on the stand.
Attorneys Heney and Pillsbury broke
loose in wordy war yesterday. Heney
asked until Tuesday for a presentation to
the Court of Appeals of his motion fox-
Striking out big blocks of the evidenca
taken. Pillsbury refused, saying he was
held accountable to the court for th-j
prosecution of the case. Then Heney sal I
something mean about the consideratt
ness of attorneys and provoked a reply
from Pillsbury "that it was merely a
difference and he couldn't help it." Ha
was willing to stand upon his reputation
for grace and courtesy. Heney said: "I
am ' here neither for grace nor favor, Mr.
Pillsbury, and I think you should at least
show ordinary courtesyfcto a brother at
torney. But your mind is constructed o*i
different lines. You can't help it." The
amicus curiae was too busy to say much,
so he let the matter drop.
The examination will be continued at 9
o'clock Monday morning, and at 11 a. m-

enbuga yesterday morning to attend the

The first of the eight-Inch iron pipe for
the Standard Oil Company's pipe line to
extend from the Kern River oil field to
Point Richmond has been shipped from
Pittsburg and is now on the way to Cali
fornia. This will be great news to thou
sands of persons financially interested in
the prosperity of the oil industry of Cali
fornia, for it means that the Standard Oil
Company has determined to enter, as
<-arly as possible, into competition with
the railroads operating in California for
the transportation of the bulk of fuel
oil from the producing fields of the State
to tidewater on the bay of San Francisco.
"When the line is actually in operation the
rate for moving oil will probably not ex
ceed 10 cents a barrel. The railroad now
charges 40 cents and the significance of
this probable saving of 30 cents a barrel
\u25a0Rill not be lost upon those who are in
the oil industry. In connection with the
beneficial effects that the great combina
tion known as the Associated Oil Com
pany can be counted upon to bring about,
the lot of the oil men promises to be
much better in the immediate future
than it has been in the past.
Authentic information Is received that
the Standard Oil Company has contracted
for the manufacture of the entire amount
of pipe that will be needed for 400 miles
cf pipe line. At the same time the con
struction of tanks, that will be needed in
connection with the pipe line, with the
aggregate storage capacity of hundreds
of thousands of barrels, is in progress in
the East. Many of the tanks have been
completed and they are ready to be
moved to California. Work will be pushed
as fast as may be necessary upon the re
mainder.
In the construction of the pipe line and
its accessdries the Standard Oil Com
pany will expend $5,000,000. The first step
taken by the company in connection with
the pipe line was to secure rights of way.
This work has so far been accomplished
that there are very few breaks in the
continuous land grants extending from
the Kern River fleld to tidewater and the
breaks are insignificant. There will be
no obstacles to prevent the laying of the
pipe line when the proper time comes,
In the near future, to perform that work.
Connecting Other Districts.
Mention has been previously made of
the great refinery that the Standard Oil
Company will construct at Point Rich
mond. To this the oil will be piped. At
first there will be only the direct line
from the Kern River district to tidewater.
Branches will b* laid later to connect the
McKittrick and Coalinga districts.- While
the distance direct from Bakersfield to
tidewater is only about 270 miles, which
\u25a0will be the length of the main pipe line,
the lateral branches that will be con-
LAW COLLEGE STUDENTS
FORM DEBATING SOCIETY
structed, from time to time, will give for
the pipe line system a total length of 400
miles.
The fact that the Standard Oil Com
pany has already arranged to invest
J5.000.000 In the pipe line and other large
sums in lands and in the refinery to be
placed at Point Richmond fully demon
strate that the large corporation has de
termined to be a great factor in the hand
ling of California fuel oil north of Te
hachapi and also that its astute managers
have faith in the permanency and vast
ness of the supply that is to be devel
oped in this State. No more nattering
tribute to the richness- of the oil re
sources of California could possibly be
paid, for the Standard Oil Company's
experts are the best.
The company has solved the problem of
moving the dense fuel oil over the long
distance between. Kern County and San
Francisco Bay. There has been an opin
ion in this State that the oil could not
be piped long distances. The confidence
of the Standard Oil people, based upon
their actual experiments, continued dur
ing a series of months, evidently deter
mines that the fear that the oil could not
be piped is a mistaken one. The .plan
adopted is to have pumping stations dis
tributed along the line at intervals of
twenty miles and there will be settling
tanks at each station, to settle the oil
before pushing it farther along upon its
journey. Experiment has demonstrated
the feasibility of this arrangement and
has also resulted in the selection of the
right sort of pumping machinery to do
the necessary' work. All the pipe will be
of eight-inch- diameter, which will per
mit of a rapid movement of a large bulk
of oil.
'Arnfy of Employes.
The construction of the Standard Oil
Company's pipe line will call into use an
army of employes In this State. Even
after the line has been made ready to
operate and is in actual use the employes
will be legion. The necessity of walkers
to . guard and watch the pipe line, the
machinists needed to make repairs and to
do the necessary construction work that
will be required from time to time, the
gangs to attend the numerous pumping
plants and to the settling tanks and to
start the oil upon its journey and to re
ceive it, will make it necessary to keep
up a long payroll. The Standard Oil
Company people say that there will be a
village at each of the company's pumping
stations along the ! entire line of pipe.
This news, by reason of the several
series of facts already published, will be
eeen to be of vast importance to the en
tire State. San Francisco will receive
fuel for manufacturing purposes and for
other uses in large quantities, in reliable
6upply and at rates for moving that will
onable the oil producing companies of the
State to make money for their stock
holders.

blowing up of Arch rock in the San Fran
cisco Bay was a failure. He saya that
the Government was -well satisfied -with
his work and the statements that have
been made that the rock is still a menace
to navigation are untrue. Mr. Axman
ripserts that in shattering the rock he ful
filled his contract. He says that within
a few months the sunken fragments will
have been removed by dredging.
