STREETS RESOUND WITH THE RHYTHMIC TRAMP OF THOUSANDS
OF WORKINGMEN IN PARADE TO EXEMPLIFY DIGNITY OF LABOR
There were men who worked all the
night before in bake-shop, or printing
office or press-ioom, and with little sleep
or none hurried to the rendezvous to obey
the mandate of the union. There were
crafts whose members have not known an
idle day in months. Of one great body of
allied trades not. a man of them" had
Workers and Strikers in Line.
In the long line that wound through the
streets, trades of vastly different char

the finest workmen In their craft that the
world has seen," led the, van, and in the
miles of paraders that followed were men
of other trades equally skilled and still
others of all degrees of manual dexterity
and mental training, down to the men

stock In trade. â¢

of labor. But it was a parade amplified
much beyond the proportions of the pro
cession ordinarily Been upon this day.
Entirely orderly, and for the most part
dignified, the demonstration was unique
and full of significance.
FOR three hours yesterday the
rhythmic tramp of union men re
sounded In the streets of San
Francisco. Twelve thousand
Eturdy sons of toll marched shoul
der to shoulder In column of eights, form
ing a Bober-hued pageant of tribute to the
dignity of labor. "When the marching was
over some thousands of those who were
not too tired or too impatient gathered in
Mechanics* Pavilion, and listened to other
tributes to honest toil, paid in the elo
quence of earnest speakers and the
melody of musicians. And at night the
men and women of the laboring classes
mingled in a grand ball, where enjoyment
was genuine and the turmoil of industrial
strife was forgotten for the time.
It was the greatest of Labor days In all
the history of the city since the working
man first begaa to celebrate a day of his
own. Never before had bo many men
participated or so many thousands of
people witnessed a Labor day demonstra

STEVEDOBES NOT IDLE.
Gangs Sent to Port Costa and South
Vallejo.
Though yesterday was a holiday and
there was but very little work attempted
on the water front, the stevedores who
have contracted to load the deep-water
ships at Port Costa were not Idle. Most
of the pickets on duty along the front
turned out with their various unions and
the stevedores were not slow to seize upon
the opportunity to send a number of non
union hands to the upper bay. . A launch
containing twenty-one men, hired by
Menzies & Co., left the foot of Jackson
street in the morning for Port Costa,
where they were put to work loading the
Engelhorn with wheat. Eleven . negroes
were sent to South Vallejo on the steamer
Herald by Whlteside & Co. to load the
Foyledale with flour.
-About the only vessel on which there
was any work done along the front yes
terday was the collier Pleiades. It was
expected that the work of dischar.rinsr her
would be completed last night so that she
could leave for the north to-day for an
other load of coal. â¢

.' The. van of the procession swung Into
Market street from Kearny at 11:35. It
'was 1:20 when the last section of the last
division reached Newspaper Corner," an
hour and three-quarters having been oc
cupied by the procession in passing that
-point. Scarcely had the last man of the
last union in line turned from Kearny into
Market street when the band that led the
parade came marching back down Mar
ket, followed by the machinists, on the
countermarch after having paraded out
"to Van Ness avenue and out the avenue
to Bush street and back.
. From the ferry depot to Van Ness ave
nue dense crowds lined the streets, pack
ed the thickest near the water front and
at such points as Montgomery and Mar*
ket and Kearny and Market and thin
'ning out as the distance grew from the
pednt of starting. Outbursts -of cheers
frequently greeted unions whose behavior
Eince the Inception of the strike has won
; public sympathy or whose sturdiness of
bearing or other attribute excited admir
ation.
The paraders themselves cheered each
other and greeted popular firms and per
sons with salvos of applause. The Exam
iner was frequently greeted with cheers
and the waving of flags, but in the main
'the cheering came from the unions that
out. on strike. The men who are
working were less demonstrative and
many of - the unions passed Newspaper
. JWted tool in the regular course of work
for fifteen weeks. Others, numbering into
the thousands, had not done work nor
receive'd wage in six weeks. Their
thoughts were centered upon the indus
trial strife to which they are a party and
perhaps the chief sufferers, and to them
the parade was nothing more nor less
than a display of the numerical strength
and the steadfastness and determination
of their forces. There were many whose
leaders had Induced them to break con
tracts solemly made with employers and
who wait with wavering hope from day
to day for word that the leaders have
reached agreement with employers. And
there. were thousands heavy of heart for
. the misfortunes of their fellows, but
â¢ thankful that their own unions had had
grievances less sore or had considered
contracts more sacred.
Enthusiasm was at a high pitch
throughout the parade, though it was
most noticeable with the unions that are
out on strike and, of course, at the times
'when, the densest crowds of strike sym
pathizers were being passed. A few floats
efid banners relieved the monotony of the
Â¦ long line and thousands of small flags
,v.-ere carried by the paraders and waved
in unison when something occurred to
arouse a display of enthusiasm. .

quarter past 11 o'clock, fifteen minutes
'later only than the schedule time. The

had been coaching through England and
living generally in the most expensive

Hempstead for the benefit of her health.
She obtained an introduction to. Beeton,
a member of the stock exchange, to
whom the defendant represented herself
to be the owner of securities worth,
roughly, Â£jj0O,OOO. She said she wanted to
buy a thousand shares of United States
Steel Corporation as a speculation. This
operation required Â£1000, whioh. the de
fendant said, she did not have, but as she
wanted to invest, immediately she told
Beeton she had cabled- to a trust com

Rear Admiral Schley's attorneys
will make another effort to have
Rear Admiral Howison relieved
from duty on the court of inquiry before
tlie court assembles. They propose to
appeal from Acting Secretary Hackett to
Secretary Long, if the Secretary returns
to Washington before the date set for the
opening of the court. They point out
that there has been no official action in
the matter, as the correspondence be
tween Acting Secretary Hackett and Rear
Admiral Howison was personal.
They. will appeal from Acting Secretary
Hackett's refusal to write an official let
ter to Rear Admiral Howison, asking for
an explanation' of the alleged interview
printed in the Boston Record, and will ask
Secretary Long to send the rear admiral
such an official letter. Tney will justify
this action on the ground that it will pre
vent Melay, as it will probably settle; the
question of Howison's eligibility before
;ihe court meets, and will make it unneces
sary to make a contest before the court
rxear the head of the division was the
banner of the Riggers and Stevedores, an
nouncing the organization of the union
In 1853. The Columbia Park Boys' Club
Drum Corps headed the division and
made a very creditable showing. The
Marine Painters had a prettily decorated
boat. as a float. The Pile Drivers and
Bridge Builders had an engine and pile
driver In operation, and the engine's
hoarse whistle was heard along the entire
line of march. The Coal Teamsters were
represented by a number of loaded
wagons. Â¦ .
Women riding In carriages, four-ln
hands and barouches drawn by six horses
owed their participation in the parade to
the generosity of the Hackmen'S Union.
Officers of the Labor Council claim that
approximately 20,000 men were in line, but
"several actual counts, made independent
ly, do not bear out that estimate. A
count made for The Call gave 12.200. A
National Guardsman counted 10.700 men
in line. Captain Seymour, at the sugges
tion of Chief of Police Sullivan, placed
Detectives McJMahon and Ed Gibson at
one point, and Dinan . and Wren at
another point. Their count3. all made
independently, were within fifty of each
other and approximated 11,300.

Scarcely "had the doors been opened

couples. The first number was followed
by three others and a few minutes before
9 o'clock ttLC alignment was made for the
grand march.
Floor Manager P. H. Coyle of the Hack

the march around the floor. Following
the floor manager came the leaders of the

Strikers From the Water Front.
A large number of unions were concen
trated in -the -fifth division, of which
Charles Siskron was the marshal, assisted
by the following aids: W. Storey, S. J.
Cooke, Fred Zimmerman, George Barry
and John Grace. The organizations repre
sented were the Horseshoers. Stationary
Engineers. Metal Â¦_ Polishers. Buffers "and
Platers. Brass Finishers. Carriage Black
smiths, Carriage Painters. .Carriage
Woodworkers, Brass Molders. Coopers,
Boxmakers-^and Sawyers, Shipwrights

Leather Workers, Boot and Shoe Repair
ers, iUpholstsrers. - Tailors,- Electrical
Linemen,. .Wooi - Sorters and Graders.
Stablemen and -Tobacco Workers. .
The Sawyers were preceded by a device
representing the Implements of their
trade, the Glassblowers carried glass
canes and theTanners iiad a transparency
with the motto, "Patronize Home Indus
try." , Each member of the Journeymen
Tailors wore a boutonnlere. '
intersection of -Hayes. Market and Larkin
streets. Instead of returning on the east
side, of Van Ness avenue when Bush
street, the turning point, was reached,
Casey swung the head of his column to
the west. This necessitated moving east
along the south side of Market street as
far as Third street and returning on the
north side in order to reach Mechanics'
Pavilion without breaking the column in
two.
Third street was reached at 1:35 p. m..
Just two hours after the parade entered
the street. At that time there were two
lines of men, each arranged four, six and
eight abreast, extending from the corner
of Market and. Third streets to Van Ness
avenue and" along Van Ness avenue to
Bush street. This affords an excellent
I Idea of the length of the procession and
â¢ a. ready means of approximating the num
ber in line. Many men left the ranks at
Market, and Third streets and in conse
quence the crowd that was expected at
the pavilion was small in numbers. Lieu
tenant John Martin had a force of twenty
police officers there, but they found little
difficulty in controlling the crowd. A
large number of women entered the pa
vilion, but- did not remain long.
Flags and Bright-Hued Banners.
., While no attempt at extraordinary dis
play was' made, the line at all times was
a moving mass of color. Nearly every
man carried an American flag or a deco
rated cane: Every man wore the badge
of his- organization, and many banners
in bright colors told the spectators the
name of the = union that was marching
by.' Many carried emblematic devices of
their craft.
. ; - The most effective display was made by
the 140 members of Horseshoers' Union
No. 25. S Headed by an immense floral an
vil, borne on the shoulders of four stur
dy hammer wielders, the officers of the
union marched. Then came a float with
a forge, from which horseshoes were
turned out as the parade moved. One
Â¦woman on Van Ness avenue begged for
one for "good luck" and a warm horse
shoe was tossed to her. -She picked it
up in her gloved hand, knd before she,
knew what she was holding -there -was. a
strong odor of burned k}d' and a' woman'
looking for a damp place in "which 1 ; "t<S*
drop a hot shoe. She stood by. her tasfe'
and her horseshoe" and later; -waved -i^
triumphantly as the forge masters" .'re
turned along'the avenue. Every:'. member
of this union wore leather aprons," tlack
skull cap, black shirts and black ; ties.-
The horseshoers were applauded- all
along the line for their natty - appear
ance. . ':
Immediately after Grand Marshal Ca
sey and his aidsâ Phil J. Dietz and Gus
Hardie â came a barouche drawn by four
white horses in which were seated Presi
dent W. H. Goff of the San Francisco
Labor Council. Secretary Ed Rosenberg
and Walter Macarthur, president of the
day.
To the members of the iron trades was
given the van of the procession.- The
marshal was William McCabe, president
of the Iron Trades Council, assisted by
"W. R. Butler and J. A. Kenny as aids.
The organizations represented were the
machinists, machinists' helpers, boiler
makers, boiler-makers' helpers, coremak
ers, ship drillers, steam fitters and help
ers, pattern-makers, machine hands, iron
molders, blacksmiths, blacksmiths' help
ers and Amalgamated Society of Engi
neers.
Men Who Built the Oregon.
The men of these unions marched with
precision and presented a number of very
effective features. A flag at the head of
the boiler-makers bore the Inscription,
"A -Relic of Manila Bay," and the iron
shipbuilders had a float representing the
battleship Oregon bearing the legend,
"We are the men who built the Oregon."
Many of the men wore sunflowers. The
iron molders had out their big banner
and a float. . ', ' " .â¢ -
H. L. White was the marshal of the
second division and he was assisted by
H. A. Barber. Ed Smith, A. J. Gallagher,
"W. Denahy, J. P. Fitzsimmons and E. L.
Gamble as. aids.
The organizations In line were Typo

paper Mailers No. 18, Photo Engravers
No. 8, Stereotypers No. 29 and Book
binders.
A wagon load of prettily costumed
young ladies and a banner stretching al
most from curb to curb, Â¦ bearing the
words, "Our National Motto â Union For
ever," formed thte features of the dl-
Marshal Frank Miele of the third divis
ion had as bis aids G. F. Aubertlne,
Charles Goetz and J. C. Lane. The fol
lowing organizations comprised the
division: - Brewers, Bottlers, Drivers,
Butchers. Cooks and Waiters, Barbers,
band. Bakers and Confectioners, Laundry
Workers, Boot and Shoe Workers, Broom
Makers. Retail Clerks, Shoe. Clerks, Gar
ment Workers and French Laundry
Workers. :. . .
The Brewery Workers were distinguish
ed by bunches of hops and ears. of barley
worn in buttonholes and hat bands. Their
band played "Die Wacht Am Rhein" at
frequent intervals and they were loudly
cheered on account of their picturesque
appearance. The Bakers were headed by
their banner and a number of men in
white uniforms.
â¢Although it was only a half holiday for
them. Journeymen Barbers' Union No. 148
made a. splendid showing, the ranks being
constantly filled as the- men quit work
after the noon hour. The Broom Makers
carried brand-new brooms over their
shoulders and wore small brooms on their
coat lapels. A transparency bore the
words, "What will you -patronize, convict,
Asiatic or white labor?" "
/ yw- T7ILLIAM H. KLESS, a non-
Xi )\ / union teamster, was arrested
>\A\/ shorfly after 8 o'clock' last
"V V night by Sergeant Shaw and
posse at Third and Mission
streets with a smoking revolver In his
hand, which. he had just discharged in a
melee with strikers. Kless was with his
wife when a gang of striking teamsters
surrounded him and began- to jostle him,
with" the evident intention of separating
him from his wife and giving him a beat
ing. --r He-drew a revolver and in his ex
citement it was discharged, the bullet
striking the sidewalk near him. â He was
charged, at the Southern police station
with discharging firearms within the city
limits.
William Coleman, a lad 20 years of age,
while;. walking along. Pacific street yester
day afternoon about 3 o'clock, was. at
tacked by about fifty strikers, who shout
ed "Scab! " athim and struck him on the
face with' their; fists. Â¦ For a moment he
was taken | by. surprise and then ran for
his life, hotly pursned by the mob of
strikers, whose numbers were quickly
augmented till there were about 200. Cole
i man rushed up a stairway near Montgom
1 ery avenue and took refuge in the house.
The mob continued to howl In front of the
house . till some one notified the Central
police station and -Sergeant Campbell and
posse arrived. in- the patrol wagon. They
found Coleman bleeding, at the mouth and
nose and his eyes swollen. He said he
came from Hanford Saturday and had
not been working here. The police drove
him to his lodgings in the patrol wagon
and advised him to keep to his room till
to-day at least.
William Henry, a laborer, arrived from
Stockton Saturday night and engaged a
room at 448*A Third street. Sunday night
about U o'clock he had Just entered the
front door to go to his room when he was
attacked by about fifty strikers, onÂ© of
whom hit him with a "billy," knocked
him down and kicked him". They tore his
trousers and coat in pieces and stole his
hat and shoes, leaving him bareheaded
and barefooted and covered with blood
He went to the Receiving Hospital early
yesterday morning, where, his wounds
were dressed. Later he was taJcen to the
Central Police Station and an officer was
sent to his lodging-house to get clothing
for him. He said the men who attacked
him called him a "scab," but he had not
sought for employment.
S. Johnson, an employe of/ the Bradford
Quicksilver Company of San Jose, now
on a visit to thi3 city, was knocked down,
kicked and beaten by a number of men
supposed to be union teamsters last night
at the corner of Fourth and Folsora
streets. After beating him. into insensi
bility they went through his pockets and
relieved him of a sold watch and chain
and $10 in coin. He was then ducked in
a -watering" trough, restored to conscious
ness and left lying on the sidewalk. He
was -found by a police officer, who sum
moned an ambulance and had him con
veyed to the Emergency Hospital. :
Frank Kane, a non-union man, resid
ing at 412 Main street, .was attacked by
a number of strikers last night as he
was walking along the seawall and beat
en so badly that It was found necessary
to send him to the Harbor Hospital for
'treatment? Kane- was to have gone to
work this morning for the Simpson Lum
ber Company.
Albert Thll, first mate of the National
City, was sent to> the Central Emergency
Hospital last night by a watchman em
ployed at the foot of Fourth street. HÂ»
was badly beaten about the face and
head by six men who waylaid him as
he walked down the Fourth-street dock;
to take a small boat to reach his vessel.
pTf-^a HE celebration of Labor day by
1 the Building Trades councils of
I California attracted fully 6000 peo-
II pie to Shell Mound Park yester
day. The occasion was one of un
alloyed pleasure to all who participated
in the festivities. A â¢ more orderly and
Â¦well behaved gathering was never seen
anywhere. The affair reflected great
credit upon the committees, to whose
painstaking efforts its success was prin
cipally due.
It- was 11 o'clock when the festivities
began and every few minutes thereafter
the crowd was swelled by the arrival of
visitors from every quarter of the com
p&srs. At 1 o'clock, the hour scheduled
for the trophy contest. 3000 persons were
on the ground, and an hour later passage
way through the grounds was difficult to
find. The delightful weather made the
day an ideal one for picnickers and those
who. did not care to. dance or witness the
games passed their time plea_"S3.ntly in
shady Â¦ nooks or floral bpwers. Not a
single accident occurred to mar the thor
ough enjoyableness of the occasion, a
fact that elicited favorable comment from
more than cne during the day.
The Building Trades councils of this
city and Oakland furnished the largest
quota of unionists, Â¦who, with their fami
lies and friends, made up the gathering.
Every trade affiliated with the councils
was represented on the ground. The con
tests were spirited, but the rivalry for
trophies and prizes was entirely g/oodna
tured.
The Literary Exercises.
The literary exercises were held in the
<5ancing pavilion, for the time deserted by
the dancers. The programme was with
out ostentation, but the numbers never
theless attracted an audience that tested
the capacity of the structure. The presi
a>n of the day. P. H. McCar.ny, was the
principal speaker. He was warmly
greted and he briefly explained the aims
and purposes of the Building Trades
Council of California. He said in part:
The council Js composed of a proportional
representation, of delegates from each affiliating
Â¦union, comprising every guild within the build
ing industry of the city. It controls the build
ing Industry from the foundation to the roof,
end it has wisely adopted a policy that permits
of no interference from any miscellaneous cen
tral body or organization. Its constitution pro-
Aides that unions In the building industry must
be organized and guided solely by the Building
Trades Council, as it cannot divide responsibil
ity uith any central body made up of divers
.trades and callings. . .
The objects for which the Building Trades
Council has been organized are "to organize
ell branches of labor engaged in the construc
tion of buildings or in the preparation of ma
teriaJ therefor; to form such building trades
unions into compact and practical working cen
tral bodies known as Building Trades Councils;
to preserve the building industry inviolate from
the disastrous results of foreign interference
and entangling alliances; to assist and co-op
erate with all bona fide labor organizations, in
order to present a solid phalanx against the
misuse cf capital; to assist in having the hours
of labor shortened according to displacements
caused by the introduction of improved meth
ods in the system of production and distribu
tion ; to urge the passage and enforcement
of la-nrs beneficial to the people; to effect an,
equitable adjustment of all, disputes, between
employer and employe: to more thoroughly ln
ouicate the principles of trades unionism." â
Controlling the building -industry in its en
tirety, through the thoroughly organized and
educated membership of its . affiliating -unions,
enforced by the working card Fystem- and gov
erned by capable officials, the Building 'Trades
Council has attained a standing in .the com
munity on a iÂ«ar with that of the. beat organiza
tions in the State. ; -.
At present the Building Trades Council of San
Francisco is composed of thirty -^elx unioni,- rep
resenting a total of 15,000 organized building
craftsmen. As a central labor "body it has no
superiors and few peers, If any. Its pasfrecord
is the best guarantee of its Juture. success.- Its
loyal friends, numbered In thousands, are found
to all the better walks of life, whom we- pay
I tribute to for their able and valuable assistance
because they have earned the most' r " profound,
thanks of the council, and Bhould,therafoTB-Â«ni'

Organization of "Workingiheiu
John E. McDougald followed , with a
carefully prepared address on the sub
ject of "Labor Unions; Their Purposes
and Benefits to the Wage Worker." Mr.
McDougald spoke at some length upon
the need of organization by workingmen
in order that their interests might" be pro-,
tected. He called attention to the state
of workmen prior to the organization of
Jabor unions, and compared it with their
state since unionism has become a factor
in industrial life. Since the formation of
solid unions the wage scale has advanced
fully 50 per cent. In many of the build
ing trades the eight-hour rule is in, force,
with better pay than was received years
agro for much longer workdays. Union
ism, continued the speaker, made men
more self-reliant, independent and honor
able. It raised them to higher planes of
usefulness and made them better and
nobler citizens of the commonwealth.
J. F. Kearne, ex-presldent of the
Building Trades Council of Alameda
County, delivered a brief address, in
which he spoke of the peace and har
mony existing between the council and all
who have relations with that body. The
organization was at peace with all the

In addition to these there were several
amusing features on the programme that
furnished enjoyment for the spectators.
Chief among these was a pie-eating con
test, in which a dozen lads engaged. The
first prize of $2 was captured by Emmet
Wilson, and the second prize of $1 was
won by Romeo Flaherty. The apple-eat

The first prize of $2 was won by Law

: â¢worldâ a state due to the admirable prin
ciples that are the soul and spirit of the
institution. The affiliated unions were
I composed of earnest men, who appreciat
ed the responsibilities of their stations
1 and who were guided solely by . principle
and love for one another. The speaker
said that without harmony and single
ness of purpose and' action no organiza
tion could prosper. Because the Build
ing Trades Council of California did not
lack In any of these things Its operations
were uniformly successful,
The addresses were followed by rag
time melodies rendered by the Waterman
sisters and a solo by K. Gilchrist. At
the completion of the exercises dancing:
was resumed, and until 11 o'clock, this
I amusement was unremittingly indulged
in by hundreds.
Racing and Other Sports.
The afternoon hours' were devoted to
racing and other outdoor sports. A fine
programme of events had been prepared
by the committee, and with few excep
tions-this was carried out to the letter.
The first event was the grand Labor day
contest for. the Phelan cup, to be award
ed to the union making the best appear
ance. This trophy has been twice won
by the Cement Workers' Union, and the
members were 'determined to capture the
valuable memento permanently. The con
testants were the Brotherhood of Car
penters and Joiners, Stair-builders' Union
and Cement Workers. After the march
the judges were unable to decide between
the respective merits of the Stair-build
ers and Cement Workers. Decision was
consequently reserved until next Satur
day evening, when the prizes will be dis
tributed.
The union races were hotly contested,
and excited great enthusiasm. The re

Many houses in Bocas del Toro continu
ally fly American, British, German or
French flags to denote the neutrality of
their inhabitants. The Colombian Gov
ernment considers that the measures
taken there have been made necessary by.
the exigencies of the case. .
The local trade, which has been chiefly
in bananas sent to the United States. Is
virtually dead. Fruit steamers from Mo
bile and New Orleans are getting only
partial cargoes, the disturbed conditions
preventing work on the plantations. The
foreign element predominates in. the town,
Americans, Germans, British and Chinese,
in the order named. The United States.
Fruit Company of Boston owns many
banana plantations Jn the neighborhood.
The United States Consular agent in
Bocas del Toro has made an urgent ap
peal to the United States Consul in Colon
to send a gunboat. Commander Sargent
of the United States gunboat Machias is
fully Informed of the situation and If it
does not Improve shortly, the Machias will
probably proceed to Bocas del Toro. The.
Liberals on Provision Island say they
have in no way Interfered with or in
jured foreigners and that the Government
alone is responsible for Â¦ the restrictions
laid upon commerce. .
The United States, French, British and
German consular agents in Bocas del Toro
told the Colombian commander there that
lf^the severe harbor restrictions Interrupt
ing commerce were not abated they would
call for gunboats. This resulted in a lim
ited improvement to harbor regulations
only.
Martial law prevails In Bocas del Toro.
The authorities have stopped communica
tion with other ports except Colon. They
have stopped local fishing and forbidden
passage along the streets after 8 o'clock
at night. Foreigners protest that the
measures adopted for harbor supervision
materially Injure commerce. Two "Ger
mans were sent to jail for expressing their
views too freely in a cafe and it needed
the intervention of the German Consul to
effect their release. .
Counting reinforcements the Govern
ment has about 170 men the$e and the
town can only be reached by very light
draught steamers through round-about
channels.
The Liberal position is strong and the
situation is likely to remain as It is until
one side or the other makes an attack.
Such an action would subject the attack-
Ing party to the severe fire of their op
ponents, as it would be necessary to pass
from Bocas del Toro to Provision Island.,
or vice versa, in small open boats. Neither
side is Inclined to take this risk. The
Liberals profess to believe that a procla
mation of the situation would result in a
withdrawal of the Government force from
Bocas del Toro. .
The Liberals express no desire or inten
tion to damage the town or to molest for
eigners or foreign vessels. There is easy
communication by mail with the land east
and -west of Â¦ Bocas del Toro. Cannon,
arms and ammunition are obtained from
coast towns in Costa Rica and Nicaragua,
Bocas del Toro being about forty miles
from the Costa Rlcan frontier.
For more than a month the Liberals
have been threatening the town. About
a fortnight ago they improved their po
sition on Provision Island, about a mile
and a half from Bocas del Toro, which
also is on an island, and the opposing
forces have occasionally exchanged shots,
although, with the exception of one Ja
maican wounded, there have been no cas
ualties.;, Among the Liberals are several
who own property in Bocas del Toro.
COLON, Aug. : 31 l (Delayed by the cen
sor). â Bocas del Toro, flf teen miles from
Colon, is virtually besieged by the Lib
erals, or insurgents. They number at
least 200 and, as already, cabled, occupy
Provision Island, which is opposite the
town and commands the entrance. to the
harbor. .They are fairly well armed, pos
sessingtwo small modern cannon, as well
aB plenty of ammunition, and axe com

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 2.â General
Arthur MacArthur, until recently military
governor of the Philippines, believes that
within six months it will be safe to begin
a gradual reduction of the military force
in the islands. Until that time he thinks
it will be prudent to maintain 40,000 troops
there.
"Aside from one or two guerrilla bands
now operating there Is no semblance of
organized warfare against the United
States." said General MacArthur. "There
is one gToup of insurrectionists prosecut
ing predatory campaigns in Southern Lu
zon, hi the island of Samar there is an
other which is operating under similar
conditions: Centered about these two
bodies of men there is a good deal of
fighting, but it Is all hit and run with
the insurrectionists and cannot last much
longer. Â¦ . . Â¦
"'lheve is alsp some disorder in Bohol,
and possibly in one of the lesser islands
of the archipelago, but It is not extensive
or very serious and will soon be smothered
by the American forces." â¢ _
General MacArthur says 'that the Fili
pinos are satisfied t.ith the new civil gov
ernment and it does not seem possible
that any further trouble of a general
character can ensue. He says there aie
all kinds oi chances for all sorts of busi
ness and professional men ih the islands.
General MacArthur says that nearly all
Filipinos are exceedingly. anxious to learn
English- and the children are remarkably
apt.puoiis. He looks to the. schools to
make good citizens of the rising genera
tion of the islanders. , ,, *'
Agulnaldo, according to General Mac-
Arthur, has been quite a surprise, to the
Americans since his capture. They have
found him to be a great deal more of a
man than they first thought'he was... Gen
eral MacArthur thinks he has accepted
American supremacy as inevitable and Is
now satisfied with the manner in. which
affairs of the islands are being conducted.

MANILA, Sept. 2. â There were appro
priate ceremonies In the palace this
morning at the inauguration of Dr. Pardo
de Tavera> and Benito Legardo as mero
bers of the Philippine Commission. Joae
E. liuzariaga, the third Filipino member,
was to have taken the Dath of office at
the same time, but was unable to do so
o-wlns to illness.
Civil Governor Taft said to-day that
the ceremony does not fully complete the
Government the President intends form
ing, but sufficient has been done to show
Â¦the nature of the policy to be followed.
Municipal governments have been gener
ally formed of a substantially autono
mous character. Their officers are entire-^
ly natives. The provincial governments arc
partly American and â¢ partly Filipino.
Now the Philippine Commission is part
ly American and partly Filipino, it being
the purposo of the President to form a
government in which the native element
will be able to voice the desires of the
people, their local aspiration? and neces
sities and give, the Filipinos an example
of American institutions and the cus
toms and laws prevailing in the United
States. The happiness of the people will
result from practical government and
not from theories on the part of many
of these gentlemen to appear to desire Jo
multiply the difficulties of the Govern
ment by creating new parties to embody
political theories when they might more
profitably advance their country's wel
fare by .devotipg .their, time and talents
to ; amending-and: improving the Iaw8 of
the legally constituted body.. There will
be time enough for theories when the
Government is 'running smoothly. Yester

been â¢accomplished if they feel they have

.Dr.'de Tavera, said "that hardly had the

seemed the For Freedom-Amarosa litter
had a strong lead for first money. Since
then the seekers of knowledge have been
able to get a line on some of the other
contestants and in most instances the re
sult has brought out other favorites.
Babbitt was first up and he sampled
''Ham's" dewdrop for a two-base smash
to the center field fence. He scored later
on "Truck's" single past second.
The Dutch would have scored in the
third had not Nordyke run Into a batted
ball. He was on second and started to
steal third and ran Into Schwartz's single
past short. Nprdyke went home on the
hit. but was declared out. When the in
n'ng closed the youth who tacks up num
bers in right garden put up an extra run
for Frisco. Then there was a howl. Scor
er McFarlln rang his bell frantically and
the bright youth made it 3. He was about
to put up a figure 4 when Schwartz came
to his rescue.
Arrellanes robbed Hildebrand of a two
base hit by making a high jump and pull
ing the ball down with one mitt. This
spectacular catch in a measure retrieved
his poor playing of the previous day.
"Youngey" Johnson was in his element
during the game. His cheery remarks
were apropos, as his team led all the way.
An Oakland fan rewarded him with $3.

The Dudes entered the game with a
team that resembled a piece of patch
work. Streib'3 and Franck3' absence
made It necessary for "Mother" Lohman
to play first. But they played winning
ball from start to finish.
On the other hand, Hodson pitched
great ball for eight innings only, allowing
the local men five hits. In the ninth he
eased up and was landed on for four safe
ones.
The story of yesterday's game Is a sim
ple one. "Ham" Iburg put them over
and Cal Ewing's collection swatted the
ball. When the trouble subsided it was
found that "Ham" had been touched up
for seventeen hits, and a majority of
these swats were three-baggers and two
basers. Iburg certainly pitched a
wretched game. He walked six and only
fanned four. The Dutch did not give him
gilt-edged support.

Carter with him. He has half a promise
that this club will give him another match
next monfi and If Manager Gleason will
assure him that Carter can fight the win
ner of the Walcott-Gardner right he will
send the "Kid" to Ed Wilson's ranch to
recuperate and rusticate. He claims that
Carter was not himself when he fought
Gardner. He does not want to take any
credit away from the winner of last
week's fight, but believes that Carter, in
good condition, can defeat his .last op
ponent. Carter was around town yester
day and bears evidence of having been, in
a fistic battle. He shows, however, no ill
effects from the terrible beating he re
ceived.

In the face of Tom Sharkey, who has al
ways ignored him. |
. Jack Welch will referee the fight. He
is the expressed choice of Tom O'Rourke,
and as he is liked by Gardner and his
manager, Greggains, there is no doubt
that he will t>e chosen. Further than
this, Welch is the official referee of the
San Francisco Athletic Club. * .
A battle between -Gardner and Walcott
should be worth Beelng 1 . They will box
twenty rounds for a decision, and, judg
ing by their past performances, their
bout should be extremely interesting.
Gardner will surely be a favorite over his
colored opponent by reason of his clean
cut victory over "Kid" Carter. It will
be remembered that the "Kid" won from
Walcott on a foul after he had battered
the colored man to his heart's content.
George Gardner's next opponent will be
JoÂ© Walcott, better known aa the "Bar
badoes wonder." These two boxers will
bettle the latter part of this month belora
thÂ« San Francisco Athletic Club. Man
ager Greggalns yesterday received a tele
gram frqm Tom O'Rourke, who is looking:
after "Walcott's interests, to the effect that
the terms were satisfactory and to send
on the tickets. If O'Rourke does not
change his mind they will start immedi
ately for this city. â¢
The running fields were below medi
ocrity. Decoy went to the post a C to 5
choice for the seven arid a half furlong
run and won all the way with the Eastern
rider, Foucon, up. Rinaldo. played from
threes to 3 to 2. led Canejo out for place
honors.
Following this came the unexpected
victory of Narra G. a 10 to 1 shot, in the
five and a half furlong sprint. Kitty
Kelly held the place of honor. in the bet
ting, â¢ but Foucon succeeded- !n getting
Into all manner. of trouble and ran un
placed. Narra G easily- took the lead,
beating Good Hope and Vantine.
About the most highly touted piece of
racing hardware was Rubina. backed
from twos to 7 to 10 in the sharpshootinrj
done on the five furlong dash for 2-year
olds. Foucon met with more ill luck on
this voyage and fell . easy game to Ed

Carthy rode the winner. The victor won
off by himself In 1:01 flat, finishing like a
good one. McCarthy also had the leg up
on Lost Girl, a 6 to 5 choice for the final
six furlong run. He missed a difficult
masse shot opposite the paddock, and
Whaleback, with Burlingame up, ran out
on him.

Undoubtedly the leading fixture of the
programme, the Occident Stake for 3
>ear-old trotters, with a gross value of
$2195, of which amount the winner took 60
per cent, proved a very mild contest. Only
four warmed up for the word and Italia,
a' daughter of Zombro, driven by the
clever southern reinsman Walter Maben,
won In straight heats, not being asked to
step below 2:23%. Commander Muckle
secured second money, while Charles H
and Delia McCarty bunted their heads up
against the distance nag.
. In the second heat Charles II was sent
away when completely off. his stride,
causing some adverse comment. If offi
cials in the stand wish to see the cob
webs brushed on* the harness sport they
should pay more attention to the per
nicious practice of laying up heats. El
Diablo ruled favorite for the 2:12 pace,
and, after finishing fourth in the opening
heat, went out and made his company
look like broken down buck and wing
dancers. Margaretta annexed the first
heat in 2:13 after a fierce drive with Wild
Nutling, Lafferty showing at his best.
In the third heat^she was distanced. Ac
cording- to the conditions, a horse not
winning a heat in three went to the barn.
This left the fourth heat a walk-over for
the first choice.
Two harness and four running events
were decided over a course fast for the
runners but slow for the hooked-up
horses. Favorites divided honors with
outsiders, with the books, four in num
ber, well satisfied with the skirmish. The
auction box also did some business. P.
W. Covey acted as presiding and start-
Ing judge, assisted by Ben Rush and C. E.
Paine.
J. W. Brooks dispatched the running
fields. <
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 2.â Not for years
has such a. crowd jammed its way through
the turnstiles of Agricultural Park as the
one that attended the opening of the
forty-eighth " annual State Fair to-day.
Amusements- were, provided, for old and
young and it seemed like a real old-fash
ioned gingerbread ' and ' pink lemonade
gathering. The weather -was warm and
for those who did not care to speculate on
the racing events a barbecue and dance
were furnished on the inner field, with
races for the small boys. These two at
tractions proved especially magnetic
cards and the fresh -quarters of sizzling
beef disappeared like snowballs at a
Yuma pink tea. Nearly, all of the big
business houses closed in the afternoon'
and after labor had demonstrated its
strength in an imposing parade through
the main streets nearly everybody Jour
neyed to the track, the grandstand being
well filled. So too, was, the rural visitor
prominent Â¦with his vehicle.
NEW YORK. Sept. 2.â To-day was an
other day of rest and recreation for the
Shamrock's crew. With the exception of
washing down decks and overhauling rig
ging during the early morning, no work
was performed by the green yacht's sail
ors. In the afternoon they attended the
games and foot races held by the artil
lerymen stationed at Sandy Hook.
Weather permitting, a spin will be taken
outside to-morrow, when the Erin arrives
from Newport. â¢ .
Then the breeze came up again and the
Columbia once. more shot ahead. Shortly
after the race was called off, with the
Columbia well in the lead. It will be re
sailed to-morrow afternoon, the start be
ing at 12 o'clock.
Sir Thomas Lipton, with George L. "Wat
son, the designer of the Shamrock II;
William Jameson, the famous English
yachting amateur; Ratsy. the sailmaker,
and. Captain Sycamore of the Shamrock
II, watched to-day's ' race with eager in
terest from the bridge of the steam yacht
Erin.
After crossing: the line at exactly the
same moment, six seconds after gun fire,
with the Constitution In the windward
berth, the Columbla'worked out and, get
ting her wind free, forged ahead. The
Constitution tacked off shore and shortly
after the Columbia followed, going up to
windward and passing her. . From then
on to the. windward mark it was nothing
but a steady gain for the old boat, and
when both had rounded it was found that
the Columbia had gained 4 minutes 55 sec
onds, the worst beating the Constitution
had yet received. On the second leg the
wind fell very light.
After rounding the second mark 4 min
utes 30 seconds behind and starting for
home, the Constitution carried up about
all the wind there was and passed her
rival.
At 6:30 p. m. the contest came to an in
glorious conclusion two miles to the east
ward of Brentons Reef lightship. At that
time the Columbia led by a good quarter
of a mile. The course was triangular, ten
nautical miles to a leg, the first being a
beat to windward, east by south, the sec
ond a. reach with the wind about abeam
and the third before the wind, which
hauled to make it another stretch, with
the wind abeam until the race was de
clared off. â¢ >
NEWPORT. R. I.; Sept. 2.â The second
official trial race of the Columbia and the
Constitution to-day practically had no re
sult. The yachts, for lack of wind, were
unable to finish within the time limit of
five and a half hours.

On the way up the Alauna Ala sprang
aleak and the pumps were going when she
came to an anchor. It is not thought to
be anything serious.
Quite a fleet of vessels made port yester
day. Among them were two coal-laden
barks, four of the sugar fleet from Ha
waii, an Austrian steamship and half a
dozen coasters. . â¢. Â¦
The coal-laden vessels were the French
barks Due d'Aumale, 150 days from Car
diff, and the Colonel de Villebois Mareuil,
170 davs from Swansea- Not a man on
either Vessel can speak English, so no ac
count of their, voyages could be obtained.
The Due a'Aumale brings 3006 tons, and
the Colonel de Villebois Mareuil 3002 tons
of black diamonds.
The Austrian steamer Klek, twenty
days from Hakodate, brought 40,230 bags
of sulphur. When 500 miles from this port
the Norwegian nark Pleione, fifty-six
days out from Newcastle, Australia, was
spoken. Sunday morning the British ship
Celtic Chief, sixty-one days out from Val
paraiso for San Francisco, was spoken.
Of the. sugar fleet the new four-masted
schooner Otelia Pederson made the best
run, coming from Kahului in eighteen and
a half days. The bark Mauna Ala was a
close second, coming from Honolulu in
nineteen days. The bark Oregon took
twenty-six and the R. P. Rithet thirty
two days to come up. The Oregon is to
be overhauled and and prt in first-class
shape before going to sea again. She is
under charter to load lumber and mer
chandise here for Australia.

The Ventura arrived at Honolulu just, as
the China was leaving and she passed in
through the Golden Gate just as the
China was released from quarantine. Her
running time will not be known until to

It will cost considerable to repair her.
The barkentine Fremont has gone into
the Oakland Creek to lie up until next
season. She is the vessel that made the
record catch of codfish.
The work of discharging the British
ship Haddon Hall will begin to-day at
Howard-street wharf. Captain Pritchard
is tired being laid up, so this morning he
will have steam got up | in tne donkey
engine and will begin putting the cargo
on the wharf with his own men. Not a
sailor has deserted since the Haddon Hall
arived and all of them gladly went to the
Fhip Glenesslin and helped Captain Pritch
ard's brother to get away.

While there is visible indication that
the National Tube Company intends
starting Its plants at McKeesport in the
near future, the foremen in the mill say
to-night thai the entire plant will be In
operation to-morrow. Â¦ Â¦ . .' . â¢
It is more than probable that this latest
failure at Duquesne will have the effect
of making the strike managers withdraw
all efforts in that direction.
The failure of the Amalgamated people
to cripple the Carnegie o- en-heartn plant
at Duquesne this morning is looked upon
by the steel officials as the death blow of
the strike, in the Carnegie xnL-s at least.
Last night the strike managers at"; Mc-
Keesport announced that a march would
be made this morning\to Duquesne,' and
predicted confidently that the men would
not go to work and that the entire plant
would be tied up. This morning no
paraders apeared, the men went to work
and the plant is In operation as usual.
The mills will be operated as usual to
morrow. The Painter mills in West-Car
son street started up as usual, with in
creased forces. There was no change in
the Lawrenceville district, i
During the parade most of the pickets
were Â¦ away . from the Star mills, and the
company succeeded in securing several
new men. Of the lot that arrived In
Pittsbursr early this morning 4t was- said
that a good many of tnem were for the
Demmler plant in McKeesport. The Mc-
Cutcheon plant in Allegheny did not start
up to-day, and the management said the
men there wanted to celebrate Labor day.
The officials of the Star plant assert
that to-day, the pickets about their mill
held up j a special delivery j boy from the
Postofflce with a- ; letter* for â¢ the office
while he '.was coming down-Tenth street,
and inspected the letter before he "was
allowed to* proceed. -The matter will be
reported to the postal authorities "at once.
â¢It is also charged that the strikers stoned
the companyls carriage on Pennsylvania
avenue^ this morning,' but did .no special
damage \ to the 1 occupants. The aggres
siveness < of 1 the strikers "was further
demonstrated late this afternoon, when a
mob Surrounded Willlani Jones, a colored
man, who was mistaken for a non-union
man from 'the Star Works. He had a
narrow, escape from serious Injury by the
appearance of Police Lieutenant Crossan,
who came to his rescue. Before Crossan
could secure additional aid he. was almost
overwhelmed by the large crowd that had
1 gathered. ' .
The prompt arrival of a large force of
police probably "saved him from serious
injury, as the mob appeared a desperate
one, and many demands were made that
Jones be' strung up.
Public interest in the strike Itself is
lagging, as the contest seems to have
Bettled down to an" issue A of endurance.
Evidences of Impatience: are cropping out
oh Â¦ the:/ side -of the j strikers, and ' the
authorities fear that the unlawful acts
participated in : by the strikers last night
and; to-day- about the Star , tin plant
may multiply and spread to other quar
ters."-'/ r Â»VTV " .' "Â¦ 7 Â¦ - : ' Â¦
PITTSBURG, : Sept. 2.â The big Labor
day demonstration monopolized the at
tention of- workers, and strikers here and
in the surrounding- towns, but the steel
manufacturers went on making prepar
ations for Â¦ the opening of the plants that
are shut down- by the strike and increas
ing the number of men at the mills al
ready in partial operation. . /.Â¦
Acting Governor Cooper recently re
ceived an interesting letter from one John
Kaluhi, a native, who was district mag
istrate ofO^oolau, Oahu, at the time of
the overthrow of the monarchy. At that
time Kaluhi resigned, refusing to take the
oath of allegiance to the provisional gov
ernment or the republic. Recently the po
sition became vacant, and he wrote to
Cooper, stating that he had felt com
pelled to resign years ago because of his
royalist sympathies, but that now that
all the people in Hawaii were Americans
he would like the position again. He was
appointed.
The Supreme Court has given a decision
'sustaining the income tax law passed by
the Legislature a few months ago. The
law was contested by the Chamber of
Commerce here on constitutional grounds.
The court holds that the law is valid. Jus
tice Galbraith dissenting. The law as
sesses 2 per cent on all incomes over $1000,
exempting the sum of $1000 from taxation.
Gox'ernor S. B. Dole has returned from
his trip to Hawaii for his health. He is
greatly improved in condition and expects
to resume the duties of his office next
week. Secretary Cooper will remain act
ing Governor until that time, finishing the
work of making up the annual report of
the Territory, which he had begun before
Dole returned. Cooper will go to Wash
ington with the report. He is to take a
vacation soon and he will visit the na
tional capital. He will take the report
with -him and consult with the officials
there regarding the affairs of the Terri
tory-
The Oriental Life Insurance Company
has filed articles of incorporation, with
capital etock of $200,000. nearly all sub
scribed, to do business in Honolulu, China
and San Francisco. Among ' the stock
holders are a number of well-known local
Chinese. The corporation expects to do
much business in the Orient.
Reports from the island of Hawaii -con
tinue to indicate that the volcano Kilauea
is about to break forth again. ' Visitors
to the volcano report Intense heat for a
long distance around the crater and huge
volumes of smoke are rising.
Dole Will Soon Hesume His Duties.
Ex-Queen Lilluokalanl will give a luau,
or feast, next Monday morning in honor
of her birthday. She has invited many
local officials and friends to attend. It is
about the first public appearance of the
kind t=he has made since the overthrow,
and is regarded in some quarters as a
sort of olive branch to her old opponents.
The ex-Queen is said to have reached the
conclusion that the Home Rulers are
making a mistake in spending their time
and energy i" efforts to have Governor
Dole removed. At a recent meeting of
natives, where the matter of choosing a
man to be advocated as Dole's successor
was discussed. Senator Kalaukalani', who
is regarded as the Queen's political agent
and adviser, advocated letting the matter
drop altogether. Delegate to Congress
Wilcox ls said to have proposed the name
of Prince David Kawananakoa.
During the trial of the cases the ques
tion of the disqualification of Justice
rvrry was raised. Perry was a Circuit
Judge when the cases were tried and he
heard the cases and sentenced the de
fendants. He also ruled on an applica
tion of the defendants' attorneys to have
the juries instructed to bring in a unani
mous verdict. denving such a motion.
On this ground it was claimed that Perry,
having already parsed on the cases in "a
lower court, was disqualified from hearing
the appeals. The court. Galbraith dis-
Fenting-, held that the habeas corpus pro
oetdny? was a new case, in which Perry
had not sat, and that he was not disquali
fy. The majority decision of the court
was by Perry and Chief Justice Frear.
A meteor of exceptional brilliancv and
duration was observed at an early* hour
on the morning of August 25 by captains
of vessels tn this vicinity. It has been re
ported by several of them as having il
luminated a large part of the skies. Ac
cording to the captains, it was visible as
a large flame for a minute and a half. On
two of the lnterlsland steamers it gave
quite a scare to the Japanese and native
employes.
Justice Perry Is Upheld.
The Supreme Court holds that it was
not the intent of Congress in passing the
lowlands resolution with this provision
to repeal Hawaiian laws that were in con
flict with the constitution of the United
States, and that the old Hawaiian law as
to convictions by nine jurors, and under
Indictments brought without a grand
jury, was not abrogated.
The cases have now been brought be
before United States Judge Estee. At
torneys Brooks and Davis, for the prison
ers, have asked Estee for a writ of habeas
corpus on the gTound that the defendants
are held in custody without having had a
trial according to American law. Estee
lesued a writ in the case of one OsakI and
will hear the case next week. The writ
wp-E asked for on the same grounds as
the Hawaiian Supreme Court has just de
cided against. The claim is made that
the defendant was not given the Amer
ican right of an IndictmenJ; by a grand
jury and conviction by a unanimous ver
dict of a trial jury.
The decision, remanded back to jail
6even defendants who had been released
on habeas corpus by Circuit Judge Gear
of the First Circuit Court Gear held
that the provision in the Newlands reso-
Jution. that laws of Hawaii "not con
trary" to the constitution of the United
States "remained in force," meant that
laws that were contrary to the constitu
tion, were abrogated and annulled. On
this cround he held that the trial of a
man on a criminal charge, without the in
c.ctment of a grand jury, and his convic
tion without a unanimous verdict of a
Jury, as provided by the constitution and
decisions of the United States, were null
and void.
HONOLULU. Aug. 27.-The Territorial
courts appear to be in a muddle over the
question of the constitution following the
flag to Hawaii. The Supreme Court has
just handed down decisions, with Gal
bralth dissenting, to the effect that "dur
ing the period between the annexation of
these islands to the United States and
the establishment of Territorial govern
ment, persons accused of crime could law
fully be prosecuted without the interven
tion of a grand jury and convicted, by nine
out of twelve jurors."

LITTLE FINGER TELL ME TRUEâ
A. D. A., Berkeley, Cal. The origin of
"Little finger tell me true," is traced to
Moliere in\"Le Malade Imaginalre," 1673,
and is based on the following from trie
second volume: . Mr. Argan wished to
pump his little daughter, Louison, re
specting a young gentleman who was pay
ing attention to her elder sister. "Be care
ful," said Mr. Argan, "for here is a little
finger that will tell me if you are not
truthful." After the little one had toM
all she knew, he put his little finger to hia
ear and said: "Here, my little finger is
saying something; yes, my little finger
tells me that^you saw something which
you did not tCll me." To this the little
one replied: .''There, my papa, all I have
to say is that your little finger is a liar."

SUCCESSIONâ S. P., City. The law of
succession in California declares that if
a husband dies intestate and he leaves a
wife and one child or lawful issue of such
child, the property goes in equal shares to
the widow and the child or. lawful issue
of such child. If there be more than one
child the widow's share is one-third. On
the death of the husband one-half of the
community property goes to the widow..
MOTHER CAREY'S CHICKENS-Sub
seriber, City. The name,* "Mother Carey's
Chickens," which the sailors apply to the
stormy petrels was applied during the
first great French revolution to the fish
fags or fish wives of Paris, because, like
the stormy petrel, whenever Â¦Â» they ap
peared in force on the streets of that city
they always foreboded a tumult of politi
cal storm.
; Another factor that has been helpful in the upward
movement is the spread of education and the ad
vancing intelligence of the general mass of the popu
lation. Furthermore, the improvements made in the
tenement districts of the great cities have had the
effect of rendering the, lives of the poor more health
ful and have diminished the craving for. drink/ Thus
each improvement made has had the effect of aiding
other improvements,;and all have tended "toward the
uplifting of that unfortunate class of. men and women
who under old conditions in England had no hope
of emerging from, poverty and distress, and who ac
cepted pauperism as an inevitable part of their life.
In this respect, then, thecensus showing can be justly
noted . by $he 'Â¦ British with a- genuine gratification.
The remarkable decrease is said to be due to some
extent to the greater care exercised by the authorities
to prevent impostors from passing themselves off as
paupers and' thus living on the community' without
work, and something is also to be attributed to an
increase of private charity that saves many from
applying to the public for relief, but after ample de
ductions are made for these there'remains ample evi
dence in the diminished roll of paupers to prove that
the working classes have become more thrifty than
of old and more independent. With the rise in wages
and the inducements to save offered -by the savings
banks and. the numerous co-operative societies, the
people as a rule have advanced in independence and
in self-respect. It is no longer common among them
to spend dl their earnings and look to the poorhouse
as a place of refuge in old age. j.
AMID themany perplexities that confront them,
the British are finding something'of genuine
consolation in the returns of the recent cen
sus showing a notable decrease of pauperism in Eng
land and Wales. Between 1861 and 1871 the propor
tion of paupers to the whole population of those
countries ranged as high as forty-eight per thousand,
while there are now less than twenty-six per thou
sand.- The official figures reveal the ; gratifying fact
that despite the increase in the population as a whole
there are now actually less paupers' by one-fifth than
there were in the sixties. . â¢

SOLVENT DEBTSâ K. T.. City. The
law of California says that solvent debts
or credits are taxable and defines "cred
its" as "those solvent debts not secured
Dy mortgage or trust deed owing to the
person, firm, corporation or association
assessed."
longevity of the population show, however, that from
the increase of doctors there has come no harm.
The duration of life of the average American has
increased considerably in the last ten years. -The
average age at death in 1890 was 31. 1 years, while in
1900 it was 35.2 years. 1^1890 the death rate in 271
registration cities of 5000 or more population was 21
per thousand; in 1900 it was 18.8 per thousand in
341 cities of 8000 population and upward, a reduction
of 2.4 per thousand. The gross population of the
cities comprehended was 14,958,254 in- 1890 and 21,
600,631 in 1900.
Taking the increase in the length of life as an evi-/
dence of a tendency, caused by forces which will con
tinue:, to operate in the. future, some calculators have
presented glowing predictions of the coming 'of a
time when hardly anybody will die. Thus one of them
says: "If we take the round figure of 2 per thousand
reduction every ten years as the basis of calculation,
it is evident that the 18.6 death rate of 1000 -will be
wholly wiped out in ten decades. In that case the
year 2000 will find the American people living forever,
except for the comparatively few of them who die
by violence or as a matter of personal 1 preference."
Of course many theories may be advanced to ex
plain the gratifying showing of the census. Some
may attribute the lengthening duration of life to the
excellent; sanitary work done by. public boards of
health, and -some may look upon it as an outcome of
introducing sophisticated food to common use, but
we believe the general sense of- mankind will' regard
it as a natural result of the increasing number of.
doctors. At any rate, the two things are something
more thaj concomitant facts. We may doubt the
efficacy of boards of health, we may doubt the virtue
of adulterated food, but what sane man doubts his
family doctor?
, We have spoken of the increase in the duration
-.According to " his figures as given to the press
there is now one doctor to every 600 people in the
United States; The records further show that while
the death rate among doctors does not" exceed 1600
a year, there are graduated annually about 6000. Of
course if such a disproportion between the doctors
that die and the doctors that ,are graduated and li
censed to practice continue, there will soon be. a
time when we will have as many physicians as there
are people. It is argued that such a condition of af
fairs would be in the nature of a calamity.
The reports of the Census Bureau concerning the
f> HORTLY after the graduating season, when the
medical colleges of the country had sent forth
a new brigade of young doctors, some statis
tician took alarm and began to figure out that there
is a danger of having too many doctors among us.
By way of proving his case he consulted the records
and brought to light an array of statistics which when
taken in themselves seem to justify his fears.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
It is not clear, however, by what power Ireland
could enforce her claim under, the treaty should Par
liament determine to override it. The British Gov
ernment has no written constitution nor any court
with authority to set 2side an act of the Imperial Par
liament ytr. Redmond, however, seems to have no
fears as to the outcome, for he is reported as declar
ing that any suggestion of a reduction in the number
of Irish representatives is absurd. The issue in one
form or another is certain to come up before long,
for the English constituencies now unduly repre
sented are demanding additional members, and when
it comes it will bring up a new phase of the relations
between England and Ireland that will be almost sure
to add greatly to the existing discontent.
Redmond's claim is that Irish representation can
not be diminished without her consent, inasmuch as
it was fixed by the act of union, and the claim seems
to be valid. According to an authority on the sub
ject, the act provides that 100 Irish members should
sit in the British House of Commons. That number
has been exceeded by three, but it is argued that it
fixes the minimum and the number cannot be de
creased.
The interest of Ireland in the subject lies in the
fact that her population has not grown like that of
the rest of the kingdom and her people are now en
joying the benefit of a much larger representation in
proportion to population than those of England. A
comparison made from the returns of the recent cen
sus shows" that England has in round numbers '31,000,
coo inhabitants, Ireland 4,500,000, Scotland 4,500,000
and Wales 1,500,000. Were the Parliamentary seats dis-.
tributed in proportion to population, England would
have 500 members, whereas she has now but 465;
while Ireland, which has now 103 members, would
then have but 73; Wales, which now has 30, would
then Wave 24, and Scotland would have 73 instead of
72 as at present.
The explanation of the disparity is that the British
Parliamentary system was devised to represent inter
ests and not population. Thus, many of the old bor
oughs were given a representative no matter what the
population. When first arranged under the reform
bill the system proved satisfactory enough, but since
that time some cities have grown enormously, while
others have not grown at all, and as a consequence
there has arisen a demand for a change, the demand
coming, of course, from the growing and more vig
orous cities.
The subject has been under consideration for a long
time. Anything more unequal than the present ap
portionment of representatives among the people of
the United Kingdom it would be hard to find in any
land or in any age. For example, the city of Lon
don, with 26,807 inhabitants, has two representatives,
while the Rumford division of Essex, with a popula
tion of more than 217,000, has but one representative.
There are several boroughs whose members represent
fewer than 17,000 persons, while there are others hav
ing upward of 150,000 inhabitants for every repre
sentative.
FROM the vigor with which John Redmond de
nounced the alleged policy of the Conservatives
to reduce the number of Irish representatives in
Parliament it seems evident that the long-discussed
question of redistributing Parliamentary seats is
about to assume the importance of an issue of prac
tical politics. It may even be undertaken by the s
Government at the next session, for were it not hold
ing at this time a commanding place in the political
field it is hardly likely the Irish leader would have
devoted his. speech to it or been so earnest in de
nouncing it.

Mr. Wright's final plea is for instruction. He sug
gests that it would be well for the Department of
Agriculture to establish experiment stations and train
ing schools in the black belt and wire grass region to r
educate the colored farmer as to the best means of;
working his farm. Certainly the statistics show that
the negro has done much to help himself, and it is
therefore well assured that he is the kind of person
who will make best use of any help given him by
others.
Taking the negroes of the whole State of Georgia,
Mr. Wright cites official statistics showing that from
a landless and penniless class of ex-slaves in 1865 the
negroes in Georgia by the year 1900 had become
owners of upward of 500.000 acres of land and owned
taxable property assessed at $14,118,720. The im
provement has been advancing at an increasing rate
ever since emancipation and is progressing now faster
than ever. ' *
The chief obstacle that confronts the negro of that
section of Georgia in his progress is his ignorance of
modern methods of farming. Mr. Wright says: "The
colored man has had no teaching along the lines of
agriculture and horticulture, the needs of plants and
plant growth, how to use fertilizers, how to make and
use common tools and how best to handle farm ma
chinery, nevertheless comparative view of slave la
bor and free labor is decidedly in favor of the freed
negro." Little or nothing lias been done to help the
negro in mastering tbe problems of farming. He has
worked out his salvation by sheer industry, honesty
and thrift.
Then follows this statement: "The criminal popu
lation of this section is not large. According to the
report of the principal keeper of the penitentiary,
there, are out of this negro population of more than
166,000 only 673 negro State prisoners." He adds:
"Some of the planters write me that when the colored
laborer is properly treated and is not subjected to ex
tortion and undue hardships there is ho more reliable
labor to be found anywhere, considering its degree
of intelligence."
By way of supplying information on that neglected
point of the race question,; Richard R.. Wright, presi
dent of the Georgia State College for Negroes, has
recently compiled statistics relating to a' representa
tive section of Georgia showing what the negro has
done and is doing in the way of work and achieving
by thrift even under the adverse circumstances that
surround him. He takes for illustration what is
known as the Wire Grass Region of Georgia. There
are thirty-two counties in the district, and in 1890 it
had a population of 144,839 whites and 166,710 ne
groes. In that year the negroes of the region owned
413,178 acres of land and Mr. Wright says: "All of
them began to work for small wages or part of the
crop. Now only about 30 per cent of them are crop
pers or wage-workers, 60 per cent of them are ten
ants working for themselves and 10 per cent own and
work their own farms."
DESPITE the race animosities existing in the
South, made evident by the frequency of ap
palling cases of lynch law, the negro has none
the less made a marked advance in his condition and
is actually enjoying a high degree of prosperity. In
the news of the day much space is given to the deeds
of the criminal negro and of the barbarous mobs that
avenge them, but comparatively little is ever told of
what the industrious negro is doing and of the. place
he holds in the social organism of the South. Â¦

city, and daughter of the late Dr.
â¢Antonio Rottanzi, who left here
two years ago for Cartagena, one of the
principal towns of the, United States- of
Colombia, to be married, is now in the
center of the revolutionary district - and
has lately written a number of interest
ing letters to her relatives here describ
ing 1 conditions | surrounding life In
.that hotbed of a Central American revo
lution. Her letters read in part as fol
lows: -
"I hope that we are at the beginning
of the end of this unhappy war. ' This

the whole: battalion of the Government
troops received holy communion, and-' I

it Is the port that communicates with Bo
gota by the river Maddalena, said that In

cocoa, revolution is everywhere rampant."
But if bad advice prevail and union labor insist
that it is antagonistic to the community of which it
is a part, and the attack on personal and property
rights shall not close, but continue until our institu
tions are overthrown, labor will find that its best op
portunity has vanished with the Government which
made it, and that having burned the bridge which
carried him over the laborer will long in vain for the
benefits he hay abandoned, the opportunity he ! has
destroyed and the advantages- which law and order
and impartial government put within his reach. .
From the loins of the men who marched in Ameri
can cities yesterday will spring the rich men, the mil
lionaires of the future. The great American fortunes
of to-day were begun, by boatmen, fur trappers," sail
ors, blacksmiths and miners, who half a century ago
were clad not as comfortably as the paraders of yes
terday, nor paid one-half the wage.
These facts admonish the working population to
turn a deaf ear to the agitators and. enthusiasts who
tell them that our Government and society are wrong
and that they are slaves with a grievance against both
that can be avenged only by violence and bloodshed.
In this country under the impartial administration
of the law there has always been and is now the best
and broadest opportunity for man that has ever been
in the world. For that reason enterprise accumulates
wealth and labor accumulates comfort. In every city
in the United States .the marching thousands^ of la
boring men presented to the world a spectacle never
before nor elsewhere possible. It was an exhibit of
the beneficence of American institutions and their
power to produce the largest number of well-paid,
well-fed and well-housed workers ever seen on the
planet.
Those who- lead or teach it otherwise are not its
friends and are actuated by ulterior motives that have
in them no good for the workers. Our institutions
are intended to uphold the rights and the dignity of
labor, and American experience fortifies* the conclu
sion that it is best for society that as many men as
possible shall begin their career with the capacity to
support themselves by the labor of their hands. Any
restriction upon this right is a wrong to society,
whether it conies from the leadership of labor or the
partial administration of the law. It pleases a part
of the labor of the j country to associate itself in
unions. And it pleases a much larger part of the
labor of the country to non-associate. One has no
right superior to that enjoyed by the other. No man
willing to work can be prevented doing so, except by
unlawful attacks upon his person. Such attacks,
while aimed at him to deprive him of his birthright
to work, are really aimed at the law which protects
that birthright, and the blow that strikes the law is
aimed at the Government itself.
THE special holiday for labor, observed and cele
brated all over the Union, was observed credit
ably in San Francisco. One was impressed "by
the plain separation of the strikers and non-strikers.
A majority of the parading unions are at peace with
their employment and omitted any evidence of malice
or disordered temper. The observer- was impressed
by the general evidence of thrift and comfort shown
by the thousands that marched. The display of well
dressed, well-fed and good-humored workingmen was
a credit to our institutions and to the Government
which protects all men impartially in their rights of
person and .property. It was plain that a vast ma
jority of the men who marched understood their ret
lation as a part of the whole community, and failed to
feel anj' class ostracism or any special class burdens
or privileges. This is as it should be. Labor is not
an Ishmael cast out from the tent of its birth to
scorch its feet in the hot sands. It is a part of the
tribe, with a birthright in the community and inter
ests inseparable from those common to all. -Z^-.-X

Go on and kill meâ torture. me if you like
âbut you will not escape my curse."
He then relapsed into silence until the
black-masked hangman appeared, when
he again railed, and cursed the officials
and made a request to be burled outside
the Jail yard. He walked firmly to the
gallows. Before the black cap was ad
justed he was asked if he wished to con
fess and replied without a tremor:
O'Brien was awakened by Sheriff Etl
beck at 7:30 o'clock in the morning. He
immediately arose and . began to curse
the Sheriff, to whom he cried when the
warrant was read: . . .
. VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 2.â Full details
of the hanging of O'Brien, the Yukon
murderer, at Dawson on August 23, were
received here in papers from the north

quietly, and although he feigned insan

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Hardy, parts his hair in the middle,
has large ears, small brown eyes, a large
nose, high cheek bones and a full face.
He is smooth shaved and has a habit of
keeping his mouth slightly open.
It is also alleged that Hardy murdered
his former partner, Williams. The v latter
disappeared after he hired the > dory.
When' Hardy was arrested a gun and a
pair of scissors .belonging to Williams
were found in his possession. .
. General Wood is anxious that when
Cuba is turned over to the independent
government the treasury will be In
a first class condition and that. the cur
rent receipts be at least equal to the ex
penditures.
They were found by a Deputy Marshal.
The watch bore the inscription, "Julius,
to Florence," the latter being the first
name of one of the Sullivans.
General Wood advised the officials of
the War Department to-day not to put
into effect the proposed revision of the
Cuban tariff. He. fears that the new tar
iff which has been framed would not pro
duce sufficient revenue to provide. for the
expenses of the island. The present tariff
yielded last year about $16,000,000, being
about one million more than was required
for the insular expenses.
Governor General Wood, who stopped in
Washington for a few hours to-day on
his way back to Havana, explained why
it would be necessary for the American
occupation to continue until next spring.
The Cuban constitutional convention has
not yet adjourned, but it is expected to
do so soon after General Wood's arrival
in Havana.
After thisaadjournmerit, according to
the provisions of the electoral law framed
by the convention, 112 days must elapse
before the holding of the first elections
under the new government. These elec
tions will be for subordinate offices. Then
112 days more must elapse before the hold
ing of the Presidential elections. It will
thus be some time next spring or possi
bly early in the summer before the Presi
dent can be inaugurated and the Cuban
government set in operation. Until the
new government is actually in running
order General Wood will continue to gov
ern the island as a Military Governor and
the American troops will remain.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 2.â Cuba will
not be completely evacuated by the mili
tary forces of the United States until
next April at the very earliest.
When Hardy heard . that the officers
were after him he tied up, it is claimed,
bis gold watch, a diamond JUn and a few
other pieces of Jewelry - ana hid them.
In company with a man named Wil
liams, Hardy deserted from the schooner
Arago in Unimak Bay. The two went to
some fisher folk and endeavored to obtain
the loan of a dory. It seems that at this
time, they parted. Williams was success
ful in getting the boat, but Hardy did
not have money to make the deposit
which was demanded. He then,. it is. be
lieved, crossed the Island to the east side
of Cape Lapen and there murdered j the
three men of the Sullivan party. - Ho
stood on a high bank above them, it is
alleged, and ODened fire. This was on
June 7. He then returned to the bay,
made a deposit with the fisherman, ob
tained the dory and rowed around by
False Pass to the northeast corner of the
island, where he gambled with fishermen.
He lived in a cabin belonging to two men
named Rosenberg and Â¦ Scott, both of
whom were held as witnesses against
him. It was at this place that he was ar
rested. â¢ - Â¦
Hardy, who is 25 years old, pleaded not
guilty to the charge against him. Hie
career on the island has been traced by
Deputy Marshal Sullivan and other offi
cers. In addition to the testimony of
Owen Jackson, a survivor of the Sullivan
party, which has already been published,
strong evidence was collected against the
young man. ; n. Â¦ Â» â¢Â¦
Hardy says that when he was mustered
out in San Francisco last year he had
$1100 in his possession. Commissioner
Whipple, before whom he had his prelimi
nary hearing, it is reported, declares that
he had only $585 on him when arrested.
Hardy says he had $6S5 left of the original
$1100 at that time, and accuses the Com
missioner of holding out $100. According
to advices, the Grand Jury, before It re
turns to Nome, will make an investiga
tion of this phase of the case.
Hardy claims to be a nephew of John
Wanamaker of Philadelphia, ex-Postmas
ter General of the United States, and de
clares that he served in the Philippine
Islands with the Tenth Pennsylvania Vol
unteers, entering as a private and rising
to be first lieutenant in his company. He
afterward, he claims, enlisted in the Elev
enth Cavalry.
SEATTLE, Sept. 2.â Fred Hardy, who
was recently arrested In Alaska on a
charge of having assassinated Cornelius
and Florence Sullivan of Butte and P. J.
Rooney of Seattle en Unimak Island on
August 28, is probably now on trial in
Unalaska. A special Grand Jury taken
from Nome brought in an indictment of
murder in the first degree against Hardy
before Judge Wickersham. The trial was
set for August 28.

THE picnic given by the parishion

day was a great success. More
than 2000 people were In attend
ance and had an enjoyable time,
thanks to the untiring efforts of hard
working committees. There were all sorts
of diversions, including jig and reel danc
ing, races and games and a baby show.
The Rev. P. Scanlon, pastor of St."
Joseph's, and his assistants, the Rev.
Fathers Keane, Sullivan, Hartnette and
Collins, were untirinc in their efforts to
make the members of their congregation
comfortable. To their untiring efforts is
due the fact that there was not a dull
moment during the entire day. One hun
dred and fifty valuable gate prizes, do
nated by as many generous givers, were
distributed to holders of winning num
bers.
The races and games were in charge of

"The place looked like a battlefield, and
I shall never forget it as long as I live.
We had no stretchers, and it was neces
sary to use blankets in carrying the dead
and injured into the tourist car. The
action of a little girl saved one man's
life. Just a second before the collision
occurred he was standing on the rear
platform of our car, and she called him
inside to point out something of interest.
He thus escaped being crushed to death
by the car which crashed into ours."
"Superintendent Downs' car was under
the freight cars, smashed into splinters,
and no one ever obtained a view of him
cr his son, although the man who rescued
the cook says he saw the foot of one of
them.
"All of the trainmen and as many of
the passengers as could get near look
part in the rescue until driven away by
the flames, which reached the car occu
pied by the iaborers in about an hour and
& half. 'Jack' Kennedy, a bridge carpen
ter who haci been discharged from the
road the day before, performed the only
act of real heroism. He jumped into the
debris of the car, with the flames roar
ing all about him, and succeeded in cet
ling cue of the laborers within reach of
the other men. Then he fell exhausted,
with his shoes and clothing in flames.
The man he .rescued was begging pit
eously to be taken out, and~ the timbers
had been moved so that it was possible
to get to him just as a roar of fire drove
the men back. It was then that Kennedy
jumped forward and saved him. He was
himself so overcome by the heat that he
lost consciousness, but soon revived. His
clothing was so badly burned that it
had to be removed.
"The sight was one that shall never be
forgotten," said Mr. Fay this morning,
"and Is beyond the power of man to min
utely describe. We were just entering Ny
ack, and In three minutes would have
been standing at the depot, and if the
collision had occurred then every car
in our train would have been telescoped
and the loss of life enormous, for it was
a long, heavy train and every car was
filled. As It was a rear-end collision the
fact that we were running about thirty
miles an hour lessened the force of the
impact, and only three cars were dam
aged. Two ladies and three gentlemen
owe their lives to the fact that they
had just left their seats in section 14 to
go into the dining car. In fact all but
nine persons who had berths in the Pull
man were either in the dining car or the
smoking room in front of the car, and
thus escaped injury.
"Following the lirst crash there was
intense excitement and commotion, but
as soon as the extent of the damage was
known every passenger on the train did
ell he could to help in the work of res
cue. The ladies were very courageous in
proffering their services, but they were
kept away from the scene, which brougnt
tears to the eyes of strong men. They,
however, supplied bandages and nour
ishment for the injured until the physi
cians arrived at 11 o'clock.
SEATTLE, Sept 2.-Max H. Fay of
San Francisco, who was" a passenger on
the Great Northern train that was

the laborers.
Special Diepatch to The Call.
"I have heard nothing officially on the
subject," said the Consul, "and if such a
step was contemplated I feel sure that I
would have been informed of It. Minister
Wu Ting Fang is very popular with the
American Government and his - transfer
would certainly call forth a friendly pro
test from the Department of State at
Washington. The Imperial Government
would notify the Minister if such transfer
was intended and he would send me the
news. In the absence of anything official
I look upon the statement of the Minis
ter's transfer as a mere rumor. The re
port in an evening paper that I would
leave San Francisco has no foundation at
all. Even if Minister Wu Ting Fang was
removed to London I would remain here."
Ho Yow, the Chinese Consul in this city,
was seen last evening at the consulate on
Stockton street, and he stated that he did
not believe the report that Minister Wu
Ting Fang was to be transferred from this
country to England.
The report that Minister Wu" is to be
transferred is not credited at the State
Department. - It is believed to be a revival
of the report circulated in Peking some
weeks ago. which Commissioner Rockhill
at that time denied in a dispatch to the
State Department.
Mr. Wu was not willing to state who his
probable successor in Washington would
be, though the Inference drawn from the
dispatch from London is that Li Ching
Fang, the adopted son of Li Hung Chang,
having declined the St. Petersburg post,
will 'come to Washington.
Mr. Wu said to-day that he recently
read In a Chinese, newspaper that Kuei
Chun was making preparations for h'.s
departure from Peking for St. Petersburg,
and he could not reconcile these facts
with the report from London of the trans
fers in China's diplomatic representation.
Kuei Chun when assigned to St. Peters
burg did not proceed at once to his post,
owing to the outbreak of the Boxer trou
bles, but Minister Wu has not heard any
thing since, the appointment to indicate
that his mission has been canceled.
Minister Wu's three-year term at Wash
ington expired more than three years ago
and although he has not received any of
ficial notice from China he has had un
official information that he will be al
lowed to remain here for another three
years. In addition to being Minister to
the United States he Is also accredited
to the Governments of Spain and Peru,
and he is now making arrangements to
visit Peru officially.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 2.-Minlster
Wu Ting Fang, Chinese Minister at Wash
ington, does not believe that he is to be
transferred to London, and that the Min
ister at London Is to be sent to St. Peters
burg. v He has not been Informed by his
Government that any such transfer la con
templated. The general rule in Chinese
diplomatic service Is that a Minister will
remain at one post for only three .years.

That He Is to Remain

In the midst of the address. General
Nelson A. Miles arrived, and when Roose
velt had finished he was introduced by
Governor Van Sant. General Miles spoke
briefly, congratulating the people upon
their achievements in the past, which
causes Minnesota, he said, to stand in the
front rank of the States of the great re
public." He spoke of Minnesota's war
record, saying: "It is her record in history
and her glory that she gave the regiment
which made the noblest and greatest
sacrifice in the cause of humanity and
liberty."
Governor Van Sant then introduced
former Governor Ramsay. The Vice
President and party then repaired to the
Jobbers' Hall, v;here an informal recep
tion was held.
As to our relations with foreign powers.
Vice President Roosevelt said that our
nation, while first of all seeing to its own
domestic well-being, must not shrink
from playing its part among the great
nations without.
There was, he contended, but the scanti
est justification for most of the outcry
against men of Â¦wealth, as such, and it
ought to be unnecessary, he said, to state
that any appeal which finally entails the
possibility of lawlessness and Violente
was an attack l upon the fundamental
properties of American citizenship.
) "Our interests are at bottom common,"
he continued. "In the long run we go
up or down together. Yet more and- more
it is evident that the State, and. if neces
sary, the nation, has got to possess the
right of supervision and control as re
gards the great corporations which are its
creatures, particularly as regards the
great business combinations which derive
a portion of their importance from the
existence of some monopolistic tendency."-
Supervision of the Corporations.
"We cannot possibly do our best work
as a nation unless all of us know how to
act in combination, as well as to act each
individually for himself. This acting in
combination can take many forms, but,
of course, its most effective form must
be when it conies In shape, of law; that
is, of action by the community as a
whole through the lawmaking bodies. It
is not only highly desirable but neces
sary* that there should bo legislation
which shall carefully shield the interests
of wage workers, and which shall dis
criminate in favor of the honest and
humane employer by removing the dis
advantage under which he stands when Â¦
compared with unscrupulous competitors
who have no conscience and will do right,
only under fear of punishment. Nor can
legislation stop with what are termed
labor questions. The vast individual and
corporate fortunes, the vast combinations
of capital, which have marked the de
velopment of our industrial system, create
new conditions and necessitate a change
from the old attitude of the State and
nation toward prosperity."
Vice President Rooseve.lt in beginning
his address paid a high tribute to the
character and energy of the men fde
scended, he said, from a race of pioneers
which had pushed westward into, the
wilderness and laid the foundations for
new commonwealths. The men with ax
and pick and plow, who. he â¢ said, had
pushed to completion the dominion of our
people over the American wildernes*, had
shown by their qualities of daring, en
durance and far-sightedness that, they
recognized in practical form the funda
mental law of success in American life â
the law of worthy work; the law of reso
lute, high endeavor. -
Continuing, he said: "It seems to me
that the simple acceptance of this funda
mental fact of American life will help us
to start aright in facing not a few of the
problems that confront us from without
and from within.
The further programme included a re
ception in the Jobbers' Union building, a
luncheon at the fair grounds by the State
Fair Association, a. review of the Thir
teenth Minnesota Regiment of volunteers
and a dinner at the Minneapolis Club this
evening. 1 . :
Vice President Roosevelt spoke on the
judges' stand at the State Fair grounds
to an audience which well filled the
grand stand. Archbishop Ireland occupied
a seat beside the Vice President.
Fays High Tribute to Workingmen.
The party then boarded- the private
electric car of President Lowrey of the
Minneapolis Street Railway Company for
a trip "around the loop," a view of the
city -and to the fair grounds at Hamlin,
when the opening 'ceremonies began.
A committee consisting of Governor Van

The next great step In social evolution is the

be one of the mighty agencies through which
that emancipation shall be accomplished.

LABOR MEETS TO TELL ITS STORY
ONE of the most distinguished the
ologians who will take part in the
forthcoming Episcopal Convention
in this city next month is the
Right Reverend John Franklin
Spalding, D. D., LL.D., Bishop of Colo
rado, who, with his family, is expected to
arrive in San Francisco about Septem
ber 15.
Bishop Spalding is a graduate of Bow
doin College and a native of Maine. He
studied at the Thelogical Seminary of
New York, graduating in 1S57. In 1862 he
took charge of the important, parish of
St. Paul's, Erie, Pa., which he served as
rector until 1873, when he was consecrated
Missionary Bishop of his present diocese.
Dr. Scalding Is one of the most learned
prelates in the American Episcopate and
is an authority on ancient, natural and
ecclesiastical ceremonials. His adminis
tration has been fruitful. Besides a large
increase | In the number of parishes and
churches he has founded schools and hos
pitals and conducted them wisely and suc
cessfully.
Financially the Colorado diocese has
been placed upon a basis of enduring
prosperity owing to its wise Bishop. The
church has shared fully in the remarkable
prosperity and advancement of the State.
DISTINGUISHED PRELATE WHO WILL. HEAD THE COLORADO DELEGA- I
TION TO THE GREAT EPISCOPAL CONVENTION AND WHO IS EX- j
PECTED TO TAKE A PROMINENT PART IN THE PROCEEDINGS.
To curb or oppose the unjust demands of or
ganized labor by counter organization Is to be
It is said that organizations of employers are
now seeking and really expecting to accom
plish the immediate and permanent destruction
of trades and labor unions. If this be so It
i? a grave mistake on the part of such em
ployers, from the standpoint or justice as well
as of expediency, and their hopes are. In my
opinionâ happily for themselves as well as for
laborâ doomed to disappointment. The labor
organizations represent to-day the hopes and
aspirations of the working men and women of
the civilized world for a better and higher and
purer and more equitable social and industrial
system. That Idea permeates the minds of the
messes of the people who toll. It Is the fer
mentation of a transition period In social evolu
tion: The people could not rid themselves of
it if they would, because the law of social evo
lution Is superior to man and is alike superior
to "the will of capitalists and of "laborers, of
employers and of employes.
Agency in Social Evolution.
The most effective charge made against the
labor unions is that their system interferes
with the personal liberties and rights of In
dividual employers and employes i and inter
feres with the freedom of contract which is
an essential 'element of personal liberty. â¢ It
must be conceded that the trades union system
does Interfere with the freedom of Individual
contracts, and to . that extent Â¦ It is vlolative
of one of the Ereat principles for, which the
unions stand as .an ultimate; but that Inter
ference is nominal only because under the
present monopoly system of industry there Is
no such thing as freedom of contract on the
part of laborers seeking employment. Free
dom of contract Involves economic freedom on
.the part of the laborerâ an alternative and op
portunity Â¦ to reject the employment and sup
port himself by the independent application of
his labor to the natural sources of subsistence.
Laborers have not that alternative now, nor
will they have, it until monopoly ceases to
maintain its control of Industry- When that
happy time shall come no man will more ear
nestly demand for labor Its natural right of
freedom of contract than I, but In that day
labor will have no difficulty in securing and
maintaining that freedom. Until that time
sl-all come It Is idle to say that labor unions
Interfere with freedom of contract on the part
of the laborers, for. if the labor unions were
obliterated laborers would have no such free
dom. .
So long as organized labor stands for liberty,
equality and' justiceâ the principles symbolized
by the flag of our country,, borne so conspicu
ously in every hand to-dayâ as its ultimate end
and aim it should have and will have the sym
pathy of all real supporters of these principles,
in spite of any seeming inconsistencies Into
which It may be forced in its unequal strug
gle against the powers of monopoly which now
dominate our Industrial system.
No Freedom of Contract.
The enemies of labor know how to meet riot
ing ana other forms of violent law breaking.
As soon as the community shall become, as it
,! U F e AÂ° become - sufficiently alarmed and
sufficiently enraged the man on horseback is
called Into requisition and the hand on the
dial of civilization is turned backward. But
moral force is a power which the enemies of
labor cannot answer with bayonets, but only
with the Godlike force of reason, to which la
bor Itself appeals. I have said that this Is
an age of reason, in which God has given to
the intellect the "stewardship of man." In
this age reason is the key to every social prob
lem, and should be the only resort of intelli
gent . men. Speaking of the conflict between
capital and labor now paralyzing the Industries
of San Francisco, and without discussing its
merits, I say that it has but one just and hon
orable solution, and that is an appeal by the
contending parties to the court of reason. I
do not say that either side is wholly right in
the conflict. To make such a claim would be
to place finite mentality upon a pedestal with
infinite wisdom. Nor do I say that either side
is wholly wrong, but I do say that the side
which refuses to submit its case to the court of
reason is substantially wrong.
I trust that the pending strike may be thus
disposed of upon lines of. justice and reason,
but whether It Is or notâ whoever may be the
victor or victim in the strifeâ the dignity and
the rights of labor must be maintained through
organized effort until such change of economic
conditions shall be produced by intelligent
thought and the intelligent use of experience as
will bring labor and capital into that harmony
which BhQuld manifestly prevail among all who
are so completely united in interest in. the pro
duction of wealth.

Four men were beaten arid robbed early
yesterday morning in different parts of
the city and the police have been unable
to obtain any clew to the perpetrators of
the crimes.
Between 12 and 1 o'clock J. Brown of
29 Morris avenue while on his way to his
home at Sixth and Howard, streets was
attacked by six or seven men who came
out of a saloon, and knocked him down
and robbed him of $29.' R. Tmrwell, who
was with Brown, was not molested. Thlr
well thought he could recognize one of
the men if he saw him again. Â¦
About the same. time on Ivy avenue
Charles Mugler was attacked by two men,
who knocked him down and took his gold
watch and $180, all the money he had in
his pockets. He was within a block of his
home at 231 Ivy avenue at the time. â¢Â¦ -
Between 1 and 2 o'clock George Voltz,
who lives at 932 O'Farrell street, was held
up by three men at Polk street and Ivy
avenue while on his way home. He was
so badly beaten that he had to seek medi
cal aid. He drives a coal wagon for a
dealer at 236 Fuhon street.
John Bateman, captain of the fishing
steamer J^pnriettti,: while on his way to
his boat was attacked by a gang of about
ten men at Battery street and Broadway
between 3 and 4 o'clock. He was badly
beaten and robbed of a' silver watch and
gold chain and $32 50. He says the leader
or the gang was a colored man and- he
would be able to recognize him again.

It is no answer to this to say or to show
that the demands of organized labor have not
always been Just or that their methods have
not always been best. They have made de
mands the justice of which I would not defend,
and they have at times adopted methods which
were alike Indefensible. Put In a state of civ

has been so little injustice In their demands
and so little wrong In their methods.

fortunate for organized labor, for violence on

has been the. forerunner of absolute defeat. In
such a conflict the man of violence Is a weak
man and is unconsciously the greatest enemy
of, his own cause. Law and order are the pri

Before this action was taken the board
granted the application of the Pullman
Company for a. reduction on the assess
ment of its cars, as made a month ago.
from $500,000 to $350,000. Equalizers Alex
Brown, L. H. Brown and R. H. Beamer
voted for the reduction, while Controller
Colean voted against it. Equalizer To
land was absent from the session. The
application for reduction was based on a
showing that the board had made the
mistake of assessing more rolling stock
than the company had in the Sta.te.
I>. H. Brown made the motion for a re
duction and it was a long time before it
received a second from Beamer, Brown
meantime suggested that Colgan present
the motion, whereupon Cotean retorted
that Brown had discovered the error and
could make the motion himself, and that,
moreover, he did not want a lecture from
Brown. The ruffled feathers were
smoothed down, but Colgan nevertheless
voted against the reduction. The change
made no difference in the tax levy as
fixed upon.
Before adjourning the board directed
the County Auditor of San Bernardino
to extend the tax rate in that county so
as to cover the bonds <1ue In tne Needles
School District. The Supervisors, It was
represented to the Equalizers, had falieu
to make this provision and it became thÂ»
Auditor's duty to do so. -.
Adding to this the State University ad
valorem tax of 2 cents and the total rate
cf taxation of 48 cents was reached. The
board fixed upen this amount, using the
f.gures of the State Controller as a basis.
The amount of money raised by taxation
last year was $5,520,797, as against
Â£-fÂ».41S.o% needed fcr the present year. Â¦
The statement of the Controller showed
that the amount needed for the general

You want to hear something, from me about
the present strike. I want to say. to you that
we are winning. We are winning every day.
The strike Is won. It has been proven. For
In fifteen weeks the employers have been un
able to get men to . take the places of the
striking machinists. In six weeks they, have
been unable to , replace the teamsters, sailora
or longshoremen. They tell, us that -they will
starve us out. Did you see that parade to
day? Did tha t. look like starving out? There
Is much morn likelihood that the savings banks
of the city will break than that the unions will
return to work until they receive the recogni
tion for which they are fighting.
There are several ways of breaking a", strike.
Starving out, that has been tried in this case
and failed; setting one faction against another,
â¢ Â¦ .
After this bit of relaxation the strenu
ous work of the meeting was resumed.
Andrew Furuseth, chairman of the
executive committee of the City Front
Federation, was introduced by the chair
man. He spoke in part as follows:
The Berlin sisters introduced a change
of atmosphere by rendering a couple of
vocal selections. They were followed by
Will O. Carleton, who obliged with a

A Little Vaudeville Introduced
Labor unions are the greatest educators the
workingman has. Membership in a union is
In itself an education in economics, without a
knowledge of which the workingman must re
main in a state of dense ignorance about his
own condition. Organization makes better
citizens, of the men and women who come
under Its Influence. It is for the benefit of the
employer as much as for the employe, .and if
some of our San Francisco employers could
see beyond their own noses It would be to their
advantage. If they would look ahead they
would accede to the demands of the working
man instead of trying to Improve their own
material condition by grinding down the lower
strata. x
As labor organization becomes more perfect
-we will find that strikes will become infrequent
and the feeling between employer and employe
more coitllal.
We could do away with a great many of our
present legislators. .We could make our own
laws In our own union halls and in this way
save the Government the expense of making
laws for us.
The limit of the power of the labor union
Is the limit of the number of workingmen In
the country. If all the labor In the United
States were to organize and then select to
etand as one organization, there is no limit
to what it could accomplish. '
I feel sure, my friends, that if we hold to
gether now we will In 1902 be able to break the
record of the Labor day of 1901. Turning out
as we did to-day is bound to add to our
strength. It serves to apprise the hitherto
unorganized bodies of laborers of our exist
ence and to demonstrate to them something
of our numerical strength.
We are at present In the midst of a great
struggle. It Is not the Intention of the pres
ent speaker, or of any other speaker here, to go
into the merits of the present controversy. We
tee nothing ahead of us but victory and vic
tory in the near future. We all feel that thlj
demonstration, this outpouring of the labor
ing classes, will hasten that victory.
Sees Nothing but Victory Ahead.
Labor Is everything- Without labor we are
nothing. Labor is all that distinguishes man
kind from the lower animals. It is therefore,
c-nly proper, I say, that we should come to
gether and do honor to that great and. digni
fied power. This power has so impressed itself
on the legislative bodies which rule our land
that they have set aside this particular Jay for
this purpose and have declared Labor day a
legal . holiday.
This Labor day parade Is a notification to
whomsoever It concerns that the rights of la
bor must be respected, and thtt labor, when
organized as we have It to-day, is strong
enough to demand and if necessary enforce
respect.
It is proper that we should understand Just
what we are celebrating to-day. When the
tolling masses parade the streets as they did
this morning it is proper that they should re
alize just why they do it. just what it' means
to them and the lesson it is intended to con
vey to others.
I believe that we have established a record
which will stand. for many years to come. We
have established a record which is, I dare say.
without its equal in any city of the United
States. I am satisfied that this demonstration
will do much to vindicate organized labor and
to safeguard it In the future. This was an
Important occasion, and you have risen to it

morning celebration. He said:

I shall not dwell upon the principles or pur
poses of your ;â¢ organization. They are . better
understood by you than by me, and your presi
dent has ably presented them for the edifica
tion of the general public. But as he \ stated
in introducing me, 1 1 have had occasion . and
opportunity to watch the development of the
labor organizations of San- Francisco during the
past twenty-five years, and ' it~ls due to them
that I should gay that during that period the
condition â¢ of labor, in' San .Francisco and
throughout the world has been vastly Â¦-.'Â¦ im
proved through the influence of trade and la
bor unions; and my observation justifies me
In saying that the improvement ,. has not only
benefited labor,;- but has promoted the Inter
ests | of employers generally by . inspiring labor
ers with a new senseof duty and responsibility
as well as of dignity.- And I feolsafe in say
ing that the moral tone of every community In
which such organizations " have been^strong
enough to exert a substantial Influence in the
labor: field has been Improved thereby /during
that period. .. The ' laborer . has i been raised
above the demoralizing recreations and vices
to which he was then too generally addicted,
and is now giving his time and thought to the
earnest consideration cf his rights, and to earn
est, self-sacrificing effort for their attainment.
I desire in advance to compliment and con
gratulate organized labor ' of San Francisco
upon .-â¢ its magnificent demonstration In honor
of Labor, day and in support of its principles.
I never witnessed a finer or more imposing pa
rade of men. It was mighty in numbers -and
mightier in the qualities of moral .worth which
It manifested. The good order, sobriety and
earnestness -which characterized the members
of all' the? unions in. line were the ' subject of
general remark and cannot fail to have made
a generally favorable Impression upon the
minds of the people of San Francisco.
At the close of Andrew Furuseth's re
marks William McDonald sang a bass
solo by way of diversion, and when the
audience, a large portion of which was
standing up around the platform, had
stretched itself and settled down to atten
tion again the chairman introduced James
G. Maguire, the orator of the day.
Judge Maguire referred to the present
labor trouble only in a general way. He
confined himself chiefly to the subject of
organization and laid stress upon the
necessity for the use of reason and com
mon sense as the solution of the disputes
between labor and capital. Â¦Â¦ He paid his
respects to the men that had taken part
In the street parade, congratulated them
on the showing they made and particular
ly on the order which prevailed through
out the march.
He continued, his remarks as follows:
Speaks of the Benefits of Unions.
There Is no telling how long this thing is
going to last. It may be a week, it may be
months. But I want to say to you that if you
have any regard for your children, you'll stay
with it. Six years ago we were told, '.'If you
don't march to-day, you'll march to-morrow."
We were promised good times. They came,
but who got the benefit? They took away our
political independence. They are now trying
to take away our industrial independence. A
few overgrown hucksters have no right to in
terfere between us and our employers. I don't
blame them, .however, for they don't under
stand what trades unions stand for. If you
follow my advice and hold out you may rest
assured that the result will be an absolute,
clean cut victory for labor.
If you want to know what to do, find out
what the Employers'. Association wants you to
do and then don't do it. They want you to
resort to violence. They are goading you on
so that they may have an excuse for calling
out the soldiers.
Says Strikers Are Being Goaded.
that also has been tried and failed; you all
remember what happened at the Haymarket in
Chicago, that has not been tried yet. â¢ â¢
Soldiers are bound to come if there Is any
rioting. If they come, and they are .bound to
come if there is rioting, it may take some
of the spirit out of the men. it might interfere
with our success. You must be mighty careful
with whom you associate. Beware of the men
who are stirring -ur> trouble. If you see a
strar.ger talking violence, avoid him as you
would a snake. 'There are at present over
20.003 men out on strike, and yet, during the
past five -weeks there has been less violence in
the city than when, some time ago. the Gov
ernment gave 7000 soldiers a holiday. Six hun
dred mercenaries have -been sworn Into the
Curtin service for the purpose of stirring up
trouble.

Father O'Neil's lecture was listened to
r.ith great attention by the vast audl
rrrp. and at it? close he was warmly ap
plaudpd.
Influence was brought to bear and finally the
Tov* remonstrated with him, to no avail. Fi
raliy. in 1455 he was summoned from the
Vatican to ?o to Rome. He avoided going,
'fueling that "danger awaited him. He com
|-o?rd letters drawing the attention of the for
Â«ipn princes to the fact that Alexander XI
was an Infidel and a heretic. Copies of these
>nei-F were forwarded to the Pope. His de
struction was inevitable and he died a martyr
to the cause of truth and justice.
i In 14S2 he was sent to Florence and tradition
has it that the whole way to the gates of
Florence he was accompanied by an unknown
ftranger. who gave him advice. It is sup
pofpd that this stranger was an angel. At
that time Florence was sunken low in vice
and immorality. Vile literature was placed
before children. Christianity was not taught
outside the monasteries. In 1492 Savonarola
was made prior of St. Mark's Monastery. He
immediately commenced a crusade against the
vice of Florence. Those in power bitterly op
7-oÂ«?d his denouncement? from the pulpit and
j-lrdÂ»red his downfall. Some years later the
roble man foresaw his impending fate. Con
tradictions of his policy became acute. He
prpcept] his reforms, however, stronger and
mower, and Florence began to feel the bene
fit of his good work.
Accompanied by an Angel.
After much meditation he decided to enter
the church and took Dominican orders at the
nsp of 23. At that time in appearance he was
siight of figure, with black, wavy hair, full
mouth and a large nose. He was of nervous
umperament. but his face expressed that his
Voul was filled with heavenly fervor. At
t!jne he was brusoue. which made him dis
liked by many, jet he had a heart full of
Pity.
Savonarola was born in September. 1432, at
Forrara. Italy, of noble parents. He had a
liwij devotion for his good mother and possibly
through her good teachings he developed early
n. splendid character. At 13 years of age he
was a most thoughtful boy and then determined
to leave the ducal palace on account of its
vl-.-e. He found pleasure walking in the Aelds
r: i : â¢ 1 admiring all works of nature. He was
intended for the medical profession and dili
contly Ftudied. He also absorbed classic law
and wrote beautiful poetry.
To thoroughly grasp the situation of this
man's noble career, we must allow ourselves
ti> forget for a while our twentieth century
i<1eas and go back 400 years. Our dwelling
place must be Italy and at a time when there
existed a peculiar combination of church and
ttate affair?. . -Â¦Â»>--
No church history has ever given Savonarola
Justice. All have failed to give him the
credit that is due him. The most touching
act to perpetuate this noble man's memory
was performed the 23d of last May, when a
tablet was placed on the exact spot where his
scaffold stood and where he met death in
Florence.
Savonarola was conspicuous for his devotion
on one eide and on the other for the enmity
that he aroused. Four hundred years have
rolled away since his death, yet his memory
s-ti',1 lives and books and magazines a/ late as
1S38 still are filled with articles aboiA his in
teresting and yet sad career. The best dramatic
production of England's poet laureate, Alfred
Austin, Is a play with Friar Savonarola as
the central figure.
History Does Not Do Him Justice
I cannot concejve of any order that Is more
worthy of respect than that of the Dominican
Sisters. I believe they are the pioneers In
teaching the children of this city. Some years
ago their school was burned down, but though
handicapped by this great blow, they still con
tinued their good work. 1 know that you
are anxious to hear the lecture, so I beg to
introduce you to Father O'Nell.
Father O'Neil said in part:

An interesting feature of the affair, cal
culated to show the devoutness of th^

SAN' RAFAEL, Sept. 2.â A class of
more than sixty convicts will be confirm
ed In San Quentin prison, next Sunday
morning at 9 o'clock. The services -will
be conducted by Archbishop Riordan, as
sisted by the Rev. Fathers John Eagan
and Robert Sesnon, both of whom, for
the last two months have been giving
the applicants Instructions In the teach
ings and doctrines of the church.
To Father Sesnon, "the convicts'
friend," is mainly due the pleasure of
leading the wayward men into the
church. For more than a year he has
devoted his time and energy to the con
victs, or, as he calls them, "my boys."
The success that has greeted his efforts
has done much for the men and not a
little for the prison management by way
of making the convicts better prisoners.
In the class to be confirmed next Sun
day there are men of all classes, serv
ing sentences for all grades of crime.
Some have never seen the inside of a
church, others years ago have wandered
from Its door. The class will be the
largest of its kind ever seen in San
Quentin.

During the Civil War he held an as

signed for duty to Nashville. He left the
service with a particularly creditable rec
ord in 1S65 and resumed his old practice.
During the cholera epidemics of 1866 and
Dr. Schiff was 78 years of age. He was
born in Lippe-Detwold, Germany, August
20, 1833, and received his professional edu
cation In that country and in Austria.
After some practice in the hospitals at
Prague and Vienna he came to America
in 1857 and located In Chicago. Finding
the climate In that city did not agree with
him he removed to Nashville. Tenn., in
1S59 and remained there until 1S?S.
disease at his residence, 1S20 Pine
street, early yesterday, morning. Death
came wholly unexpected during the night
which followed the celebration of the
thirty-seventh anniversary of his mar
riage.
â â R. GUSTAVUS SCHIFF. a well
known physician of this city and
an ex-army surgeon, died sud-
denly from an attack of Bright's
1 1873 he achieved considerable distinction
through the heroism and self-sacrifice
with which he labored in behalf of the
sufferers. During the administration of
President Arthur Dr. Schiff was appointed
a member of the board of pension exam
iners and retained this office until Cleve
land was elected. He was reappointed as
secretary of the board by President Har
rison, but retired on account of ill health.
In 1878 he removed to Dallas, Tex.,
where he established a lucrative practice.
He visited California in 1890 and was so
pleased with the country that he came
here to live five years later.
His widow, who was a Miss Rosenberg,
is a native of Westphalia and came to
this country to marry Dr. Schiff in 1860.
Six children were born to them, four of
whom are still living. A daughter. Geor
gle, is the wife of B. D. Pike, a prominent
wholesale liquor dealer of this city. Three
sons, Benjamin, Edward and Max, are
also residents of San Francisco.
The funeral will take place from the
Pine street residence at 10 o'clock Wed

ance with an often expressed wish of the
deceased, the remains will be cremated.

her last sail with the fishermen in their
races for the Lawson prizes.
BOSTON, Sept. 2.â The yacht Independ
ence, built at great costâ some say* of a
quarter of a million dollarsâ for W. A.
Lawson, who hoped to use her as a can
didate for America's cup honors, and
which purpose failed, went out to-day for
what was to be her last sail. As tho
breeze failed she will have a try to-mor
row. Mr. Lawson kept his promise that
the people of Boston should see her under
sail and in racing trim before she went
out of commission. She never looked flner
than to-day.
LAWSON GIVES HIS
YACHT FINAL SAIL
I have Informed the trade to-day, through
trade journals that are read all over the
United Statea, of the present situation, and
that if the growers | fall to support the asso
ciation by- all sienlnK the lease the directors
will enforce the association's rights to the con
trol of the crop under the old contracts and
will fix. a price of 2 cents a pound in the
sweatbox for this season's crop. No dealer
will now be so foolish as to buy any raisins.
Inside or outside, at any Â¦ hlsrher price until
this matter Is settled. This â¢ Interruption and
delay In the â¢ Bale of the new crop at the
opening : of the season may deprive us of a
market for half of ' the crop at anything
above distillery prices, but better that than to
see the association wrecked. The lonsrer the
delay now In signing the leases the greater
the loss on the coming crop.
I am notified that a mass meeting is called
for the llth. What â¢ good can that meeting
do? If these leases are not'sl*ned before the
llth much of the damagre will ' already have
been done. There Is still time to save the
situation and get 5 cents a pound. If you will
stop all other work and get the leases signed.
If you do not, you will suffer losses .In this
and In coming years that will cripple you
financially for a long time to come.
FRESNO, : Sept. 2.â President Kearney
of the Raisin-growers' Association has

Commander Schroeder, Accused of
Despotic Rule, Will Not Dis
cuss Charges of Secretary.
Commander S. Schroeder. the alleged
despot of Guam, arrived yesterday on the
China and went to the Palace. Whether
the charges that have been recently made
by his one-time secretary, William B.
Smith of Oakland, are or are not well
founded the accused officer refuses to say.
In fact, when heard last night Comman
der Schroeder refused to say anything on
any subject beyond declaring through the
medium of a transom that he had turned
in and was sound asieep.
Commander Schroeder relieved Comman
der Leary as Governor of Guam, that lit
tie Island possession of Uncle Sam's which
was acquired during the late unpleasant
ness with Spain by the expenditure of a
great deal of powder and talk and with
no bloodshed.
Shortly after entering upon his duties
fas "king of a cannibal isle" Governor
was given an assistant and sec
retary in the person of William B. Smith
a son of Police Judge Mortimer Smith of
Oakland.
Mr. Smith recently returned from his
trip and since his arrival home has been
delivering himself of a number of criti
cisms of his former superior in office
These criticisms can hardly be called i
friendly. In fact, they might be termed
Fomewhat caustic by one who had "no
friend, no brother there."
Mr. Smith characterizes the treat
ment that Schroeder accorded those under
him as "barbarous." In fact, it was so
inhuman, according to Smith, that a num
ber of the marines took to the hills, where
they have remained ever since, subsisting
on tropical fruits, for all the world like a
number of monkeys in a South American
forest. In support of his story. Mr. Smith
ral lf^ ne - ntton to tbe fact tha * under 'the
terrible Schroeder regime there were sev
enty summary courts-martial and twelve
general courts-martial, and that of the
150 marines in the command more than
eighty were punished for one offense or
another. Mr. Smith ended his statements
by declaring that the abuses at Guam
were so flagrant that they will be the
subject of a Congressional investigation,
et which he will be present.

Many school teachers, at the end of
their year's work, feel thoroughly ex-
hausted and worn out. physically and
mentally. The' demand upon the nerves
end brain of a teacher Is unusual and un -
less they are well fed and fed upon prop-
erly selected food It Is natural that they
should run down,
A little woman teacher at Gobleville,
Mich., who has been teaching regularly
foi a number of year, has always found
hereelf thoroughly exhausted at the end
of the session, until within the last year
Fhe has made use of Grape-Nuts Food,
with the result that she closed the year
as a robust healthy, strong, vigorous
woman, having gained In weight from' 90
pevnds to 126; her nerves strong,
face bright and cheery, and really a worv
e'er to all her friends, who constantly
ctmment on her color and strength. She
knows exactly to what the change Is at-
tributed, for In the years past living- on
ordinary food, Ehe has almost broken
dewn before the Fchool year closed,
whereas since using Grape-Nuts this
change has been brought about; evidence
rrlma facie of the value of Grape-Nuts

.BERLIN, Sept 2.â The United States
Embassador, Andrew D. White, has re
turned here.
CONCEPCION, Chili. Sept. 2.â The Brit
ish bark Collessie, Captain Auld, from
Newcastle, N. 8. TV., July 9. for Val
paraiso, has been lost off Coicoi Point
Part of her crew were saved. Â¦ â¢ â¢ >
The Collessie was a steel .vessel, built
at Glasgow in 1891. She registered 1381
ton?, hailed from Glasgow and was owned
by A. Weir & Co.
British Bark Collessie Lost.
When the baby commanded her father
to "Tome and see mamma," Mrs. Hol
strom was also moved to tears. At the
suggestion of the court the couple retired
to a private room to talk the matter over.
Now the case has been stricken from
the docket on motion of the plaintiff. The
father, mother and alleged tiny incor
rigible have returned to their home at
Bancroft.
Holstrom then caused the' baby's arrest
and all parties appealed in the Police
Court. The moment the little one saw
her father she ran to him, sprang into
his arms and called him "Dear old dad."
Holstrom sat by the City Prosecutor with
the child in his arms and did not attempt
to conceal his emotion.
OMAHA, Sept. 2.-VIola Holstrom. 3
years old, brought about a dramatic re
conciliation between her parents In the
Pclice Court. The child was standing
her trial on the charge of incorriglbillty
and of .being reared to mendicancy. The
charge was brought by the father In a
final effort to secure the custody of his
little daughter. Â¦ ; â¢
TheHolstrom3 lived in Bancroft, Nebr..
until, last May, when the wife tired of
mairled life and came to Omaha, bring
ing the child with her. The woman has
since lived with her parents and has kept
a -close watch on the child. Holstrom
followed his wife to this city and tried
in vain to patch up the petty misunder
standing which had resulted in his wife's
final departure. Mrs. Holstrom refused
to see her husband or to allow him to
visit with the child. ',

"Ingomar," the cattle filching barbarian,
who speaks Greek like a poet and makes
love like a fool, is the attraction this
week at; the. Alcazar, with White Whit
tlesey in' the name part and Florence Rob
erts as Parthenia. Their conception of
the characters, while differing somewhat
from that , of their predecessors, is cor
rect with but few 'flaws. They were
warmly applauded last night during the
progress of the beautiful love comedy and
were thrice called before the curtain to
receive the crown of applause, j Barton
Hill, who was a leader in the McCullough-
Barrett Stock Company in the d&ys of the
old California, has the ungrateful part of
the miserly Polydor. He plays it with all
his old-time fire and fidelity and shares
the applause with the stars at the head of

Annie Russell, slim, spirituelle, little
creature, is the Princess, and it is not
possible to conceive of anything more
finished and graceful than her perform
ance. She has the clearest, sweetest
voice, and a spirit of high-bred, delicate
comedy that could hardly be excelled. She
has, too, the air of courts about her, and
wins and holds sympathy from her first
word. Mrs. Gilbert, the ever-beloved,

"Speech?" asks the King.

"Ah, thank goodness. Tou will tell me
what to admire? Royalty, quite . er

"We have some carefully prepared im

the equerry. '
The King consents and the Cardinal
goes his own seemingly very singular
way in the matter, to the high disdain of
the Queen Dowager, who is spending a
surprised old age in learning her own
inconsequence. and everything ends
happily ever afterward. I am not going
to say how, for it is quite worth your
while to find out for yourselves. The story
is told with sprlghtliness, a radi
ant good nature, and has a dialogue that
sparkles from end to end. The side
lights on royalty are dellciously funny,
and one of the richest little touches in
the whole thing is the arranging of the
King of Arcacla's day..

many friends for its clever au
thor. Mr. R. Marshall. "A Royal Fam
ily," a new comedy, by the same author,
presented by Â¦Â¦ Charles Frohman last
night at the Columbia Theater, will win
more. Altogether one of ' the daintiest
romances of later days is Mr. Marshall 1 s
new piece, a quaint and piquant .love
story, with a setting of royalty behind
the scenes. A' certain kingdom, of Arca
cia, probably ' so-called because it is a
near neighbor to Arcadia, finds Itself on
the verge of an inconvenient war with a
stronger power. The war equipment of
Arcacia is of the comic opera order, it is
therefore decided to offer up the Prin
cess Alestlne Victorlne Angela of Arca
cia as a living sacrifice to the belligerent
neighbor, the Kingdom of Kurland,
through the usual altar of . matrimony.
The Princess, on having the subject
broached to her, and seeing her duty
clear, naturally disapproves of the pro
posed alliance, saying that she objects
to being "married ; for the purposes of

The Tivoli company fulfilled all that
had been predicted concerning the per
formance of "Norma." That most tune
ful of Bellini's operas was. put on last
evening, with Barbareschl in the title
role, and an excellent Norma she proved
to be! In fact this was the best appear
ance that she has made so. far this sea
son, and the audience was corresponding
ly enthusiastic. Bravura is the music
generally, and the Barbareschi voice
filled the requirements very thoroughly
and satisfactorily. Poletlni's contralto
was heard to very good advantage jn the
duos with Barbareschi. Castellano's role
of Pollio was handled very well. He sang
as usual, . his high notes being very
strong. Dado was a triumphant Oroveso.
His solos in the first and last acts de
serve special mention. Of course the
"Casta Diva," by Barbareschi, and the
hackneyed "Hear Me, Norma," were the
features. The orchestra fairly outdid' it
self in the loving and caressing manner
n which it devoted itself to the render
ing of the flowing and sensuous- melodies
of the score. â¢ "Norma" was popular with
our grandparents, surely, but it has not
lost its charm with the present genera
tion. The performance last evening would
alone be sufficient to make memorable the
present Tivoli grand opera season. The
less important roles went to Miss Sannle
Kruger and Cortesi. "Norma". is billed
for Wednesday, Friday and j Saturday
evenings. This evening "Mignon" will

The Tevis â¢ and Crocker estates gardens
carried off the first prizes in the dahlia
show '; which, was held yesterday after
noon at' Sherman &Clay Hall under the
auspices of the California State Floral
Society.
It was the first dahlia show ever held
in this city, and was a revelation to even
the most ardent flower lovers. The flow
ers shown were gorgeous in coloring and
with petals, as dainty as those of the
most highly cultured blossoms. The new
varieties of the dahlia which were exhib
ited resembled most the chrysanthe
mums of finest quality. In fact garden
ers and cultivators to-day declare that
the dahlia is about to supplant the chrys
anthemum in public favor and is des
tined to be the fashionable blossom for
some time to come.
The most gratifying part of the exhibit
to those having the affair in charge was
the fact that the handsome blossoms
were those of California seedlings. R.
Lichtenberg. who showed a Marge and
pleasing variety of California seedlings,
had seeds distributed to visitors. Besides
the dahlias there was' a splendid exhibit
of gladiolus made by Mrs. T. Sachau of
San Lorenzo, and also a beautiful display
of Romneya, or wild Mexican poppy, a
dainty blossom with delicate white petals
and .rich golden heart, shown by Mrs. E.
W. Maslin of Alameda.
The judges of the show were: E. Gill

It is said that Governor Baxter's view
of the matter ' is the one generally ac
cepted in Denver, where the general opin
ion prevails that Hughes should as a gen
tleman have kept his mouth shut, no mat
ter how badly he imagined himself in
jured. Governor Baxter is a native of
Tennessee and was Governor of Wyoming
when life was more strenuous in that sec
tion of the country than is the case at
the present time. Those who know him
say that when he returns to Denver the
meeting between him and the Hughes will
be decidedly torrid.
an ass.' "
"The fact is that architects are al
ready employed preparing, plans for me
for a new and handsomer residence in
Denver. My agent has a commission to
buy the site desired.
"Without referring in detail to the
many other falsehoods that have been
published, and all of which emanated
from the father or son of this hog-and
homlny-aristocracy from Missouri, I dis
miss the subject with this general re
mark: I have relied upon the intelligence
of a discriminating public to write them
down from their own acts for what they
are. 'We do not need to get very near a
skunk to . detect the ' genus. If the
Hughes family are to be the arbiters of
social recognition * in Denver, God save
the mark! About all that any of them
know of the usages of polite society
they have learned during their four
years' residence near me and under the
tutelage of various members of my fam
ily. But enough oi a nauseating subject.
There's an old Spanish proverb that fits
the case, 'It's. a waste of lather to shave
"The idea of being driven out of any
community by such a 30-cent runt is
amusing to any one who knows him. Es
pecially so in .view ' of the ! estimate
placed* upon the Hughes courage, when
it is remembered, as it practically is by
every one in Denver, that Mr. C. J.
Hughes, the father, crawled at the feet
of Hon. T. J. O'Donnell, bogging for
mercy like a whipped ! cur. -
Will Build a New Residence. *
I "As It afforded them, .Â¦ however, an op
portunity of sending broadcast through
out the country a baseless and scurrilous
article, which appeared in Sunday's pa
pers, it may have ministered somewhat
to their vulgar pride. The fact Is that
the ' house was sold on August 22, at
which time a part of the consideration
was paid. On August 28 deeds conveying
the property were passed and pay?nent
made in- full. On either of these dates
Mr. Gerald Hughes' could have indulged
in his vain boasting: and self-congratula
tions. But It is characteristic of the
man that he should wait until the even
ing of the, 31st, until within a few min
utes of the time I was leaving the city,
to indulge his self-conceit. Mr. Gefald
Hughes is about the size of a coyote,
but the resemblance is made more strik
ing because of the . sneaking and cow
ardly traits common to both.
Why Hughes Waited.
"These facts were known, not only to
all the Huches family, but to many of
my personal friends as well.
"When in California last July I deter
mined to sell the place at any sacrifice In
furtherance of the plans I then agreed
upon with my daughter. Upon my return
to Denver I Immediately placed. the house
In the hands of another agent. I selected
with great care one I thought could reach
the Hugheses. It was no surprise to me to
know that Mr. Hughes was the .real pur
chaser. On the contrary.' I knew it all
the time and as a consequence made him
pay some $10,000 more than I should have
accepted from any one else. Mr. Tyson
Dines, in whose name the. negotiations
were conducted, is a lawyer and was a
partner of C. J. Hughes. It was well
known to me, as it was known to every
one else, that Mr. Dines was not able, to
buy or live in such a house. However, it
was not left to surmise. The agent whom
I ' employed told me several, times that
Mr. Hughes was to be the real purchaser.
"If Gerald Hughes or his father can
extract any revenge or comfort from buy
ing the property. at a price far in excess
of what any one else would pay, whicn
had been for sale for three years, it onlj
Indicates they are easily satisfied.
Paid a Big Price.
"I am surprised the papers of this city
should lend themselves to the publication
of such malicious and venomous slush as
appeared Sunday morning. For more
than five months Dast 1 have seen from
time to time in the public press numerous
articles intended to reflect upon me. and
my family which 1 have passed over in
silence, as they were all written by
Gerald Hughes or his father, C. J.
Hughes, or inspired by them. Most of
this was paid for at the regular advertis
ing rates.- \ . . â¢
"As I have assumed that any differences
which I may have with them or they with
me were of a purely personal character
and not subject to newspaper controversy
I have ignored them, under the impression
that I could not reply without lowering
myself to their level. But there comes a
time when self-restraint ceases to be a
virtue. Much as I dislike now to say any
thing for publication I feel that I should
take some notice of Â¦ their Â¦ most recent
screed, even at the risk of jeopardizing
the estimate of me by a community in
which I am a stranger.' "
"First, as to the articles appearing in
Sunday's papers, I have to say that they
contain a willful and malicious distortion
of the truth. The fact is that my home
in Denver has been for sale for the past'
three years. During that period a -real
estate, firm there, which had the matter
In hand, has shown the house to not less
than half a dozen persons, who,- it. was
thought, might be possible purchasers.
Inspired by the Efugheses.
When seen last night Governor Baxter
was mad clear through. He declares the
story is absolutely false and that it was
instigated or written by the Hughes,
father and son. Governor Baxter decided
it was time for him to do a little talk
ing himself and he dictated the following
statement: â¢
San Francisco papers printed a dis
patch from Denver last Sunday in which
it was stated that the Baxter : home . in
Denver had been purchased by Hughes,
and that the sale had been forced on the
Baxters by the social ostracism to which
the Â¦ family had been subjected since the
daughter became the bride of the Cali
fornia millionaire.
The Hughes-Baxter controversy, which
started with the alleged jilting of Gerald
Hughes, son; of a Colorado millionaire, by
Cornelia Baxter, the beautiful Denver

JUDGE DUBOSE'S
MOTION GRANTED
Rehearing of Contempt
Case Ordered by Fed
eral Court.
Testimony- io Be Taken by
Commissioner Heacock
This Week.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
and United States â¢ District Judge de
Haven sat yesterday morning as a United
States Circuit Court of Appeals to hear
a motion for a rehearing of the contempt
case against ex-Judge Dudley DuBoee,
now serving a sentence of six months' Im
prisonment In the Alameda County Jail
lor having- advised a client to disregard
tlie court's writ of supersedeas.
The petition was .offered by Garret Mc-
Exifcrney on behalf of the prisoner, the
ttnas of the petition being a denial of
any intention of setting at defiance the
writ of supersedeas issued by the court
In the Nome mining cases, and on an un
qualified submission to the authority of
the court and of its processes.
Mr. McEnerney read an affidavit of
Major Van Arsdale of the United States
army.' stationed at Nome, to the effect
that the alleg-' i contemptuous language
was I not used by Judge DuBose. Major
Van Arsdale deposes in the affidavit that
ha was certain that Judge DuBose never
said that he advised Mr. Comptois or any
onÂ© else to disobey the writ. What Judge
DuBose did say was that the military au
thorities had no jurisdiction to enforce
the writ, but that the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals could punish for
ccntempt In case of It being disobeyed.
Major Van Arsdale deposed further that
as soon as he saw the newspaper accounts
of the sentence of Judge DuBose he volun
teered his service to set the Judge right
before the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Mr. McEnerney next read an affidavit
by Judge DuBose, in which he positively
denies that he advised Comptois to dis
ol:ey the writ or assist In defeating any
of the orders of the court. He denies hav
inv made the statements attributed to
him by Kennett M. Jackson and others on
the proceedings before Major Van Ars
aale. He recognizes the absolute neces
sity for all courts to maintain their Juris
diction and that it Is the duty of all at
torneys to aid the courts in execution of
their processes and orders.
Judge Morrow, after a whispered con
sultation with Judge de Haven, said that
uiÂ»or a consideration of all the facts the
court was of the opinion that the showing
was sufficient to entitle Judge DuBose to
a rehearing and to admit him to ball
pending that proceeding. The court at its
regular meeting In October would re
ceive whatever evidence Mr. McEnerney
nright have to submit, said Judge Mor
row.
Upon Mr. McEnerney calling the atten
tion of the court to the 'act that naviga
tion to Nome would be closed by the ice
by that time, the court referred the task
of taking testimony to United States
Court Commissioner Heacock and fixed
Judge DuBose's bonds at $5000.
I!* S. Pillsbury. â¢who appeared as amicus
curiae, remarked that Judge DuBose's de
rial was a surprise to him, because on
the hearing of the case his attorney
seemed to admit that Judge DuBose had
made the statements charged against him.
Mi. McEnerney explained that his
client had said to one of the litigants that
the writ of supersedeas was void, but he
had not advised the litigant to disobey the"
order.
The court requested Mr. Pillsbury to ap
pear before Commissioner Heacock and
cross examine witnesses.
