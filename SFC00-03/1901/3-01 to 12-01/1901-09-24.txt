Parts of the Supreme Court of Erie
County is a small room" on the south side
of 'the. second floor of the City Hall. The
inclosure for the bench and bar occupies
over one-half of the floor space, while
the remainder is given over to seats for
the general public. Not over 130 of the
latter 'could 1 be .accommodated, and these
seats to-day, were mainly occupied by the
men, summoned to serve 'upon the. jury.
Czolgosz .with . his counsel occupied seats
directly . in front of the' Justice's bench.
The prisoner's chair was just back of that

staffs of office r were daced at various
"The mental condition of the assassin
will 'absolutely be the only defense to be
offered," are the words of ex-Judge Titus,
and there is no little expectation that the
counsel will publicly abandon the case
and merely represent Czolgosz formally
during the trial. â¢ / .
; As' a result of the examination of two
alienists, Dr. . Carlos T. McDonald and
Dr. Allan McLean Hamilton of New York,
the question of insanity is eliminated
from the -subjects on which the defense
can rely for support. ,
.: Counsel for Czolgosz saw him again this
morning before the time for the opening
of the court, but he had no more to say
to them than . on the previous occasions
when they have visited him. In view, of
the. meagerness of the opportunity for a
defense and the fact that the prisoner re
fuses absolutely to aid them, it Is not im
probable that the enure proceedings may
be completed within two days.
room.; The .interior of the City Hall, asÂ«
well. as the outside, still bore the somber
"draperies of mourning, and quiet was en
forced, as befitting the occasion.
Â¦ No one outside of the building saw the
prisoner as he v. r as taken from his cell to
the' " courtroom. . His guards made, use " of
the "tunnel .of sobs", under /the ; street of
the City. Hall, and Czolgosz was brought
into : the courtroom only a few moments
before the hour set for the opening of his
trial. '."Â¦; No. person â¢was . admitted to the
building without a pass signed' by ' the
Chief of | Police, and it was necessary to
show: this . to . every; policeman ' on every

\ BUFFALQ," S?pt. 23.â The trial of Czol :
gosz began at 10 o'clock, but long before
that hour the streets in the vicinity of the
Gity Hall were the, objective of many cu
rious persons. ' The various entrances to
the great building, with the exception of
that: on Franklin -street, were closed and
guarded. Squads of police were stationed
on every landing and in a double linejfar
inside the place of entrance to keep back
the ââ¢ crowds, while in station not. far
away reserves were ready ; to reinforce
the 'detail on duty should the feelings of
the people be aroused to the extent of riot

around every side of the structure and no
one was allowed to stand. on the sidewalk
for a moment, so that at no time was the

It is not probable that any. defense will
be'.put. In,' owing "to the character ; of 'the
prisoner and his refusal to help his attor
neys in any way to. secure evidence which
they could use in his favor. The idea of
an attempt .to enter the question, of * his
sanity is not thought of in view of the re
ports of the' two alienists who; have re

The probable duration *ot the trial, it is
believed,- can -be placed, at two full days.
When District Attorney Penney was asked
by Justice White at noon as to the time
he would talk in the presentation of his
case . he declared that he 'would conclude
by Tuesday noon. .Titus, for. the^defense,
was non-committal, however' and replied:
"That depends upon . the ; turn ' things
take." :
The prisoner,' Czolgosz, during the morn
ing evinced no _ Interest whatever ' in .the
proceedings, but as the testimony .was in^
troduced he paid more attention to what
was said and looked at ~ the various wit
nesses closely. .â¢ â¢ '. . â¢ . Â¦ : .
Conduct of Czolgosz.
as it brought out the fact that the reason
.why the fatal bullet had not been located
at the autopsy was because Â¦ of the un
willingness of the President's relatives to
have the body further mutilated by their
instruments. Dr. Â¦ Mynter and Dr. Mann,
who followed him, both testified that the
primary cause of death was the gunshot
wound in the stomach. " One effect of this
wound was, .they said, 'to cause â¢ gan
grene to form : in the pancreas and the
spot of poisoned tissue was as large as
a silver dollar. . I ~ '
At 10 o'clock the formal opening of tha
court was announced. Justice .White en
tered through the center aisle and took
his seat on the bench. The first business
of the session had no relation to the case
of Czolgosz. It consisted merely of call
ing the roll of grand jurcrs for the com
ing session, and they were then excused
until October 1. Clerk Fisher, after a pre-,
liminary "Hear ye, hear ye," by the crier,
proceeded with the calling of the juror3
summoned for the trial of the Czolgosz
case. Of the thirty-six trial jurors called
only one asked to be excused.
At 10:16 there was a bustle in the corri
dor and a squad of police brought in the
prisoner. He was handcuffed to an offi
cer on each side, while in front and be
hind fcim walked other uniformed police.
The prisoner was attired in a new suit of
dark gray, a white shirt and collar and a
blue tie. His face was cleanly shaven and
his hair combed. He sat down behind his
counsel, with two officers in plain clothes
immediately in his rear.
District Attorney Penney at once began
the reading of the Indictment. He spoke
to Czolgosz in a low voice; in fact, so low
that when the prisoner was asked to
plead he seemed not to understand what
had been said.
' Justice White asked him, ""What have
you to say?" '
There was a, moment's hesitation. Then
point3 in the room and quiet was enforced
upon. all. .'The, spectators' seats were filled
very slowly -owing to the extreme care
shown by the officers in the corridors in
admitting those who applied, and it was
not until "court" was announced that the
last one was occupied.
Justice Truman C. "White, one of the
oldest and most experienced of the Su
preme Court Judges, was on the bench.
Immediately after the opening of the
court and alter the prisoner had pleaded
ex-Justice Lcran L. Lewis, senior counsel
for the defendant, announced that, togeth
er with his col.eajrues, former Justice Rob
ert C. Titus and Carlton E. Ladd, they
were ready to act in behalf of the pris

"I thought it lest," he said, "for my
colleagues and myself that I should say

attorneys for the defendant. At the. time
my name was suggested I was out of the
city and knew noting of what was trans
piring here with reference to the selection

circumstances of mj selection were told to

"guilty," which was subsequently changed
i to "not guilty" by direction of the court.
All the events of the day Indicated that the
trial will be short. Court convened at 10
o'clock. an<3 within two hours eight jurors
]tfH been secured. Technicalities were
not raised by the examining counsel, but
it was significant that every man who
said he bad formed an opinion in the case
was excused by the District Attorney.
Those who acknowledged that they had
formed an opinion or stated that they
were prejudiced, but admitted that their
opinion could be changed by evidence,
were accepted by each side.
BUFFALO. K. Y., Sept. 23.â Leon
F. Czolg-osz was placed on trial
this morning charged with the
murder of President William

The presentation of the Government's
case began' shortly before 3 o'clock, when
Assistant District Attorney Haller began,
with much deliberation, to address the
jury. He spoke very briefly.
The work of securing the jurors was
then undertaken with a celerity that was
amazing. Before the day was over the
entire panel had been sworn, the jurors
had listened to a description of the Tem
ple of . Music, where the crime occurred;
had seen photographs of the interior of
that structure, and had been told by three
surgeons what caused the death of the
President and the effect of' the assassin's
shot upon the various organs of the body.
They had also learned why the fatal
wound had not been located.
Jurors Promptly Selected.
"I am familiar with the circumstances,"
said Justice White in reply, "and I wish
to say I will give you every assurance
that the prisoner will have a fair and im
partial trial and that during the progress
of the trial he will receive such treat
ment as the law demands in any criminal
case."
me I was extremely reluctant to accept.
But the duty has been imposed and I con
sidered it my duty, in the light of all the
circumstances, to defend this man. I ask
that no evidence be presented hereâ that
the court will not permit the acceptance
of any evidence, unless.it would be ac
cepted at the trial of the most . meager
criminal in the land."
Dr. Herman Mynter followed,- and his
testimony was of importance, inasmuch
The remainder of the afternoon was ta
ken up with the testimony of three physi
cians, two, of whom had attended the
President during his last days, while the
other performed the autopsy. The latter,
Dr. Harvey Gaylord, was the last of the
three to be called. He described the lo
cation of the Wound in the stomach and
the direction, of the bullet. The cause
of death was attributed to the gunshot
wound,; but fundamentally he said it was
due to the changes back oÂ£ the stomach,

President extended his hand in kindly,

two shots in fact. One of them took ef

guilt of the prisoner and was excused..
James S. Stygall, a plumber; after a
George Ruehl, a barber, was a believer
in capital punishment. Ruehl is a mem
ber of 'â¢ the General Assembly from the
Buffalo district. He said in reply to a
question from Lewis as . to whether he
had talked much about the case, "People
have talked more to me about it than I
have. to them." He had formed no defi
nite opinion, but nevertheless he was ex
cused by the defense. â¢
Frederick Langbeine, a railroad section
foreman, was excused by the prosecution.
Silas Cnrincr, another farmer, living at
Clarence, had already made up Ms mind
as to the guilt of tho defendant; ho could
give him a fair trial on the evidence, how
ever. He was accepted and sworn as the
fourth juror at 11:04 a. m.. less than an
hour after the court opened. Â¦ ' "
During the examination of jurors the
prisoner pat erect in his chair and gazed
straight ahead at the back of his senior
counsel. Beyond the rapid blinking of his
eyes he seemed unconcerned. He made no
effort at communication, with his counsel,
nor they with him.
Horatio M. WlrftDcar,' a farmer, wa3
challenged by the people and wan cxuuaed.
George Kuhn, a baker of Buffalo, said
his opinion of thÂ« guilt of tho prisoner
was go firmly established that no evidence
could change it, and he was excusod.
John D. Elliott, a farmer of Grand Isl
and, was opposed to capital punishment
and he was excused.
Talesmen Are Excused.
Henry W. Wendt, a local manufacturer,
when called announced. that he had form.
cd no definite opinion on the case: hin
opinion would be governed by the evidence
alone. He was sworn in.
Joshua Winner, a farmer of North Col
lins, was objected to by the defense and
excused.
Lewis asked him if he would acquit a
man if it were clearly proven that he was
insane at the time- tho murder was com
mitted. Garwood replied that he would.
After a few questions from Lewis, Gar
wood waa accented.
Titus stated to the court the facts al
ready known as to his connection with
the case.- He explained that the position
of himself and his associates, Lewis and
Ladcl, was a peculiar one and consisted
mainly in making sure that all the forms
of law and justice were observed in tne
prosecution.
Justice White in reply complimented
counsel for the defense and said that the
prisoner could have no better counsel, and
that whatever outcome it would reflect
only credit and honor on them.
The examination and swearing in of the
jurors was then begun, the prisoner
standing as each was sworn.
The first juror was summoned at 10:26.
His name is Frederick V. Lauer, a
plumber. He was examined brie.fly by the
District Attorney and counsel for the de
fense. No objection was made and Lauer
was accepted.
Richard J. Garwood. a street railway
foreman, was next summoned. One of
the questions put to him by District At
torney Penney was:
"Do you believe in the present form of
government?" to which Garwood replied:
"Yes."
This plea was, however, not permitted
to stand under the law, and a plea of
"not guilty" was at once ordered by the
court.
District Attorney Penney then read the
indictment again in a louder voice, and to
the demand for a reply the prisoner, who
was standing at the time, said. in a very
low voice, "Guilty."
Assassin Pleads "Guilty."
the prisoner's lips moved as if to make a
reply, but before he could do so his junior
counsel, Judge Lewis, arose to speak, not
having seen the prisoner's motion.
Justice White, however, insisted that
Czolgosz should speak, and the prisoner
said. "I didn't hear what he' said. '
Dr. Herman Mynter, was the.next-wit
ness. District Attorney Penney questioned
him closely regarding the operation per
formed on President .McKinley at thq ex
position hospital immediately after, the
shooting. . Dr. Mynter said v the surgeons
found the bullet wound in the left upper
side of the abdominal cavity;. ; The.Presi
dent agreed to an operation at once, which
was absolutely necessary to save his life.
Dr. Mann was selected, with Dr. Mynter,
Dr. Mynter' s Testimony.
Dr. Harry R. Gaylord of, Buffalo testi
fied that he performed the autopsy upon
the body of the President; He described
the location of the.! wound in the stom
ach' aiÂ»d the direction of- the bullut. The
wound in the stomach, said- Dr. Gaylord,
was not necessarily the cause, of cleat!;.
The fundamental cause was the changns
back of the stomach. The actual cause
was absorption of the broken .'down mat
ter of .the pancreas. There was nothing
known to medical science which would
have arrested the progress of the changes
caused by the passage of the bullut
through the pancreas. |
Samuel J. Fields, a civil engineer, was

"I hope to complete It by to-morrow,
noon," was the reply.
"And how long will it require for your
defense?" Justice White suld to TitusÂ«.
"That depends, upon the turn things
tako. .We are not prepared to say," the
lawyer replied.
Frederick Huller. assistant District At
torney, began the presentation for tho
prosecution at 2MS p. in. Ho rovlewed tho
assassination of the President, his Hints*
and death.
"Mr. District Attorney," said the court,
addressing that gentleman, "I desire to
leurn if I can how long a time you antici
pate it will require for you to present tho
evidence of your case?
At 2 o'clock Justice White resumed the
session, and the examination of additional
jurors was resumed. The jury was com
pleted by the selection of Samuel P.
Waldo of Alden. a farmer; Andrew J.
Smith, a dealer in butter and eggs, of
Kuff^lo; Joachim H. Mertens, a shoe
dealer of Buffalo, and Robert J. Adams,
a contractor. i
Benjamin J. Ralph, a bank cashier, was
accepted, and took the eighth seat in the
jury box.
The adjournment of court until ,2
o'clock was then announced. At the same
time Czolgosz was handcuffed to the depu
ties and hurried from the courtroom bar
to the Jail.
For the first time since he came into
the courtroom to-day he spoke to one of
his guards. "Get my hat," he said, and
the officer placed it upon his head as he
walked out. â¢ â¢
Justice White expressed' himself as: be
ing agreeable to . this arrangement sind
made the hours of the court conform
with Lewis'. request.
After the acceptance of this juror Lewis
addressed the court, saying . that owing
to the fact that the defense . had little
time for preparation he desired the ses
sions of the court to be as short as possi
ble. He suggested that court convene at

a pamphlet attacking the late President

Mrs. Wonders said that she was to re
ceive one-ninth of the $29,000 as her im
mediate share.' This one-ninth, ! as well
as the balance, was to have been returned
.to her parents -when the. gypsum deposit
was sold. ->'"' Â¦ . â¢-, Â¦
She told - how Woodworth had her
write the decoy advertisement that lured
her father to Los Angeles in the very
hour on which the plot they had woven
meanwhile was to be consummated. She
admitted flatly that the coin â the alleged
$29,000â which Woodworth handed to her
mother she had never counted, and that
shÂ« had handed it back to Woodworth ten
minutes after she had delivered the deeds
to him. She did not know, she said,
whether the amount was 11000 or $30,000,
and other evidence adduced during the
day proved that Woodworth had not been
In possession of more than $1200 at one
lime since early in 1900."
The woman's confession was complete.
She even admitted the intimacy with
Woodworth. which many. had suspected,
and, although she attempted weakly to
set up a more harmless motive, she made
It evident to every one who heard her,
under the clever examination of I>eputy
District Attorney Willis, that this inti
macy had been the moving cause of her
wrongdoing. In a few words she told how
Woodworth had come to her and sug
gested a. way by which they might gain
possession of her father's farm. All he
wished to do, she said, was to get a deed
to the property in his possession. Then,
he said, he would sell the gypsum deposit
on the land and pay old man Kempley
for his farm out of the proceeds. At all
times, so ehe claims, Woodworth protested
that he had no intention of cheating her
father.

his wife by the use of poison. â¢
Without the quiver of an eyelash or a
blufch at the alternate laughter and exe
cration of those who were gathered in
the courtroom, she I confessed that the
hold Orrin Woodworth had over her was
stronger than filial love and that, with
out other consideration than his demand,
the had made possible the scheme to strip
old John K employ and his wife of their
ail.

had woven with Dr. Orrin Woodworth to
deprive her aged parents of their Iowa
farm, the one possession and source, of
income of their old age.

j Park believed that he would certainly
be. killed and eaten by the bear, as his
companions were not to be seen, and he
could do nothing to protect himself. He
had with him a little Siwash dog that he
had. threatened to kill on several occa
sions, as It was too small to pull a sled
or pack a load. This insignificant cur
saved his life. When the bear started off
with Park the dog began to bark and bite
at the animal's heels, until at last the
immense brute dropped his burden and
started after it. The little fellow ran Into
the brush, and got out of harm's way.
Here Park made a mistake/ fo'r he had
heard and read that if .= a person would
feign death a bear would not touch him.
But Apparently this is not the rule with
Alaskan bears. As soon as the old brute
had frightened away his little tormentor
he again picked up his human burden and
started off,, handling him more roughly
than before. The faithful little dog was
again at the bear's heels more furiously
than ever, and bruin was compelled a sec
ond time to. drop his human prey.
Park did not "play possum" this time,
but managed to crawl from the track into
the brush,, more dead than alive. His
two companions,' who heard the barking
of the dog, had arrived by this timeand,
opening fire on the bear, drove him away.
The poor victim was picked up, a" mass
of blood, rawvflesh and broken bones. He
was very badly bitten on the arms, legs,
back, face and head. His whole scalp
was torn loose and about three square
inches of it # was entirely gone. His face
was terribly lacerated and he was se
verely bruised about the body.
The party was a hundred miles from
its camp on Slate Creek and had no medi
cine or bandages. All that could be done
was to wash the wounded man, tearing
up shirts for bandages and using oil ren
dered from the fat of what birds and wild
animals they could kill/as an ointment for
his wounds: Park will recover, but his
head and body will be shockingly scarred.
Park .was some distance ahead of his
two companions, when he heard a noise
in the brush 'near the trail. Believing 1 it
was made by a caribou or moose, he start
ed to investigate. Suddenly he came face
.to. face with a great bear. He threw his
rifle to his shoulder and . fired, but the
bullet did not seemingly hurt the brute,
if It hit him at all. Rising on his hind
feet, the bear' seized Park in his Â¦ great
fore paws and mouth and started off for
his den In the glacier.
SEATTLE, Sept. 23.â Late advices from
Valdes state that Archie Park, one of the

River with two companions for several
weeks and had just started for Valdes,
when he was attacked by a lar,ge white

WILLOWS. Sept. 23.â Showers fell here

SUISUN, Sept. 23.â The bean crop
on Ryer Island was injured by

__ . '. . harvest began, about a week ago
and nearly the entire crop, which is val
ued at $100,000 this season, will be more or
less damaged. m
At Maine Prairie there are upward of
150,000 sacks of grain piled along the
banks of Cache Slough and Mariner
Slough awaiting shipment. This will be
damaged to the extent of thousands of
dollars. The shipment of this grain' was
delayed by the Port Costa strike.
Grapes, prunes, late peaches and al
monds have been, damaged in Suisun and
Green valleys, causing a big loss. Nearly
all shipping fruits have been harvested,
so the disaster is not 60 great as it would
have been a week ago.

man who was driving his own team, pull
ing him off his wagon and trying their
best to break his wristsâ a dastardly at
tempt, which was frustrated only by the
unusual strenjrtli and courage of the ob
iect of their violence. It had given three
lines to an attack by strikers upon the
mate- of a vessel; five lines to an assault
upon a non-union laborer recently arrived,
In which he receded a broken nose and
many wourMs on the face and head. .It
had devoted seven lines to an attack upon
a non-union fireman who was knocked
down by strikers, beaten and robbed, and
six lines to two sailors who were over
powered by numbers and outrageously
beaten.

Three men havo been killed. William

attack upon non-union men in a stable..
Frank McGulrc, a sailor, was beaten into
insensibility by strikers on the water
front. Ten days later ho died at the home
of his sister in Oakland. Renas Mathe

of an aged mother, needed work, but be
cause he accepted it strikers beat him as
they might a mad dog, and five days later
he died after great suffering.
Information regarding: the victims of
strikers' violence. It presents this and
accounts in more detail of a few of the
outrages by which strikers have sought
to prevent other men from doing the work
which they decline to do.
The statistics give only the cases at
the receiving hospitals in which the pa
tient is known to have been attacked by
strikers or their sympathizers. Hundreds
of assaults besides these have occurred
of which no record exists. In many cases
the intended victim has escaped. In oth
ers friends have taken the bruised and
bleeding laborer home and not even the
police have known of the assault and In
dignant citizens who witnessed it have
wondered why the papers made no men
tion of It. Of every ten assaults occurring
In the streets since July 16, when the gen
eral striko began, probably nine have
been entered upon neither the police nor
the hospital records.

?Â°Â° daIldSkinDlS SE SWIFT SPicClFIC COMPANY. ATLANTA, GA"It is a shame to recall, it provokes
cur bit'ter indignation to think of thÂ«
contumely, the. ridicule, the abuse,
the denunciation which were poured
out by degraded, unmanly, cowardly
and malignant newspapers upon the
noble, worthy gentleman, "William
McKinlev: against the painstaking, hon
orable President, who injured' no
man, who bore hatred for none.
Shame on those papers which
hounded President McKiniey and
used every false and dishonorable mea,ns
to place him Mn a false light before the
nation; which misrepresented his words
and actions; which cartooned and lam
pooned him; which denied him not only
the respect due to- the head of the nation,
but the respect paid to the humblest citi
zen. Shame, I say, upon the cowardly, In
famous maligners who, during the years
when President McKiniey was striving
sincerely for the nation's good, treated
him as brutally and unfairly as they
would not have dared to treat a common
criminal, an outcast; as they would not
treat the very murderer who slew h{m.
"The press must respect the constituted
authorities. The welfare of the state and
of society demands it. To ridicule the
President is to ridicule the republic.
To ridicule and sneer at the con
stituted authorities is to ridicule and
sneer at the nation. To attack 'elected
and lawful rulers so foully, so unfairly,
is to raise up enemies against them and
against the republic. No more must we
suffer the propaganda of anarchism."
"It is an awful thing to know that In
this great land, which has opened its
doors, its ports to the oppressed poor, the
miserable of all nations, which has been
the nest and home of the, largest political
freedom, which denies no man the benefit
of equal laws, which protects civil and
religious liberty, the elected chief magis
trate, a plain democratic citizen, should
not be able to walk among the people
who have raised him to the highest emi
nence and whom he served loyally, de
voutly and according to law.
"The Catholic church from the begin
ning has been the conservator, the guar
dian, the ally of the civil authority and of
the state, and In the dark and stormy
period of history when all government by"
right of law was imperiled and seemed
about to go to pieces it was the Cath
olic church which came to the rescue
of civil society, which saved the laws,
literature, the arts of peace, organ
ized society and civilization from de
struction.
"You know how persistently the
Roman Catholic church has com
bated that evil, conscienceless, god
less, negative philosophy called an
archism.
You, as Catholics, understand the enor
mity of that crime; you have been taught
by the most sacred precepts of the church
to respect the civil Government and the
constituted authorities.
"/You would not have believed that
there was in. any part of this fres
country one mind so malevolent as to
plot ill against President McKiniey.
ARCHBISHOP RIORDAN, in de
livering his sermon at the me
morial services In the Cathedral
In San Francisco last week,.re
ferred to the work done by the
Catholic church in upholding or
ganized society and civilization. In his
se â¢on Archbishop Riordan In part said:
We have come here this morning to re

PRESIDENT GOES

"Equity and law are superior to the per
sonal welfare of an individual or of the
aggregations of Individuals, and equity
and law demand that the personal free
dom of the citizen, whoever he is, be
made sacred and secure. So long as this
freedom is respected the questions evoked
in the present strike may be left, in my
opinion, - to the men, employers or em
ployes, who are directly concerned In it,
although meanwhile all citizens
have many reasons to hope and pray
that brotherly love and calm counsel
will prevail both among employers
1 end employes, and that peace will
soon reign in the land." "'..:
"Neither State nor fellow citizens may,
Interfere with my personal liberty. This is
the very core of Americanism. This is the
teaching of national and Christian ethics.
It is not for me to dispute the benefits
that may be believed to accrue to the
worklngman from labor unions; nor am I
prepared to say from the Information that
comes to me through newspapers that in
the present strike unions pretend to short
en personal freedom of men that do not
join their ranks. But this may be ever
emphatically asserted and maintained as
an inviolable principle that however much
labor unions may have reason to widen
their muster rolls, and however much they
have the legal and moral, right to do this
through pacific and persuasive meth
ods, they must not attempt to wrest
from men outside their ranks the
right to work, or to seek to coerco
them into inactivity by illegal or un
just attacks upon their civil and
moral freedom.

in the country and the conduct of the men
who had left their employment. The views
of Archbishop Ireland on strikes and
strikers are as follows: ' "
"To employes entering willingly Into a
strike the matter Is one of their own per
sonal concern, and others have .but tb
concede to them their personal right to
act In such manner as they will. Men are
the masters of their hands and of their
labor; the liberty is theirs to work or not
to work, provided they understand the
consequences that follow and are satisfied
to accept and endure such consequences.
Not only Indeed Is this liberty at all times
theirs, but we must furthermore grant
that occasions may arise,' and do arise,
when a strike, however serious the conse
quences for the workman, is a means, and
at times perhaps the sole means, through
which rights appertaining to them and
which are of vital importance to their ul
timate welfare can be secured. When it
is that under this aspect of things strikes
may be allowed, or even commended, is a
question to be determined by close exam
ination of the circumstances of each par
ticular strike. \ 'Â¦ ...'.Â¦â¢ Â¦_. ,
"I am laying down general principles of
ethicsâ not deciding the merits of any. par
ticular case. But while the right to enter
upon a strike is and must be conceded as a
right belonging to the personal freedom of
workingmen, this must ever be demandedâ
and in the name of the same principle
of personal freedom under which msn
may refuse to workâ they who cease
to work must in no way interfere
with the liberty of others who may
wish to work. The personal freedom
cf the 'individual citizen is the most
sacred and precious* inheritance of
Americans. The constitution and the
laws authorize it; the spirit of tho
country proclaims it; the prosperity
of the people, the very life of the
nation, requires it. Whatever. the
other interests at stake, that of per
sonal freedom of the individual out
ranks them all, and this must be sus
tained even if those are to be sacri
ficed.

"We have prayed for the President's
life, but it did not please God to grant
our petition. Let no one Infer from this
that our prayers were in vain. No fer
vent prayer ascending to the throne of
heaven remains unanswered. God an
swers our petitions either directly or In
directly. If he does, not grant us what
we ask he, gives us something equivalent
or better. If .he has not saved the life of
the President he preserves the life of the
nation, which is of more' importance than
the life of an individual. He has infused
into the hearts of the American people a
greater reverence for the head of the na
tion and a greater abhorrence of assassin
ation. He has Intensified and energized
our love of country and our devotion to
our political institutions." .
"Let it be understood, once for all.
that the authorities are determined to
crush the serpent of anarchy when
ever it lifts its venomous head.
"The most effective way. to stop
such crimes is to inspire the rising
generation with greater reverence for
the constituted . authorities , and a
greater horror for any insult or injury
to their person. All seditious lan
guage should be suppressed. Incen
diary speech is too often an incentive
to the acts of violence to many with
whom the transition from words to
deeds is easy.
"It Is a sad reflection that some fanatic
or miscreant has it In his power to take
the life of the head of the nation and to
throw the whole country into mourning.
It was no doubt this thought that inspired
some writers within the last few days to
advise that the President henceforth ab
stain from public receptions and hand
shaking and that greater protection
should be given to his person.
"You might have him surrounded with
cohorts, defended with bayonets and have
him followed by argus-eyed detectives,
and yet he will not be proof against the
stroke of the assassin. Are not the
crowned heads of Europe usually attended
by military forces? And yet how many
of them have perished at the hand of
some criminal. The strongest shield . of
our chief magistrate Is the love and de
votion of his fellow citizens.
"As President he was thoroughly con
versant with the duties of his office and
could enter into its most minute details.
His characteristic virtues were courtesy
and politeness, patience and forbearance
and masterly self-control under very try
ing circumstances. When unable to grant
a favor he had the rare and happy talent
to disappoint the Buppllcant without* of
fending him. The domestic virtues of Mr.
McKiniey were worthy of all praise. He
was a model husband. Amid the press
ing and -engrossing duties of his official
life he would, -from time to time, snatch
a few moments to devote to the invalid
and loving partner of his Joys and sor
row*. ' â¢
"Few Presidents "were better equipped
than, Mr. McKiniey for- the exalted posi
tion which he filled. i .- -
"Whatever may have been the errors
of Judgment on the part of the late,Presi
dent (and who is free from them?), no
man can honestly charge him with
tyranny or official 'corruption. .
"The Redeemer of mankind was be
trayed by the universal symbol of love."
If 1 may reverently make the comparison,
the President was betrayed by the uni
versal emblem of friendship. The Presi
dent could have said to his slayer, 'Be
trayest thou the head of the nation with
the grasp of the hand?' He was struck
down surrounded by a host of his fellow
citizens, every one of whom would gladly
have risked his life in defense of his be
loved chieftain. . ,-. \"

was a masterpiece of eloquence and is
here reproduced;
"It has been my melancholy experience
In the course of my sacred ministry to
be startled by the assassinations of three
Presidents of the United States.
"In the annals of crime it is difficult to
find an instance of murder bo atrocious,
so wanton and meaningless as the assas
sination of Mr. McKiniey. ,
CARDINAL GIBBONS, In deliver
ing a eulogy on the life of the
martyred President William. Mc-
Kiniey last Thursday in the
cathedral at Baltimore, Md.,
dwelt forcibly on the suppression
FATHER PETER C. YORKE, in
addressing a mass meeting of the
strikers last Saturday evening,
gave utterance to the following
sentiments:
"The trouble is that when he
(the employer) bargains with you,
he does not want to bargain with you as
a man: when he hires you, he does not
want to hire you as a reasonable â¢ being:
when he employs you, he does not want
to employ .you as an American citizen,
but he wants to bargain with an animal,
and to hire a man; he wants to have In
his service something which will do noth
ing but put out work, and never think
that it has a soul.. â¢' ,\ . <
"You have here in San Francisco
the Employers' Association, which is
a union of rich men specially started
lor the purpose* of crushing out all
the unions of poor men. * * * That
is the plan of campaign. Do not mistake
it. You can see it before you as clearly
as you can; see your way. It is the de
struction not only of the Teamsters' Un
ion, but the destruction of every union in
San Francisco; that is their aim, and the
destruction of them in order that you
men, American citizens, equal before the
law with them, endowed with the same
rights, having the same souls, but hav
ing perhaps higher aspirations, and hav
ing, I believe, cleaner livesâ that you are
to be their chattels, their slaves, to
be treated far worse than chattels or
slaves were treated in the days of old.
"All the people that are in any way con
nected with business and with the Em
ployers' Association, with the hiring of
men or living upon them, whether living
on their father's money or, like present
barnacles, living on some rich millionaire
to-dayâ all these people have put them
selves together on one side; they have all
massed themselves against you; they are
there Just as are a herd of cattle when
they are attacked by wolvesâ they all
come together, put their heads down to
the ground. 60 .have all the rich men and
hangers-on of the rich men of the city
got togetherâ against what? Against the
teamsters? Not' much. Against the long
shoremen? By no means. .Against every
rran and every^ woman who is earning
wages in the city of San Francisco, In the
State of California.
"The second way in which you can
help them is by not only paying your
money into the strike fund accord
ing to your means, but also by tak
ing care that none of your money gets
into thfl pockets of those that are
fighting you.
"So I say to you, no matter whether it
be store, wholesale shop, newspaper, or
any other business that is against you in
this fight, let every man and every wo
man, and let every child, too, say to him
self and herself, 'I will go without if I
can do without in any way, rather than
patronize such a one.'
"Three of the papers of this city have
been pitching into you pretty hard. They
have been slandering you in their news
columns and they have been writing you
up in their editorials. One of the papers
has been standing up for you. And now,
when this terrible crime stained our coun
try only a few days ago. instead of de
cently keeoing their little, miserable
squabbles to one another, nothing
would do them but to stand over the
bier of our martyred President and
{alk like fish-women. They did that,
not that they cared a rap about Mr.
McKiniey, not that they cared a whit
about the constitution- of this coun
try, but simply because they thought it
would injure a rival: that it would help
their business and extend their circula
tion.
- "Put not your trust in politicians. Put
r.ot your trust in political parties. I do
not care what the name of the party is,
I do not care who the' man. Isâ I implore
you, my friends, do not put your trust in
politicians or in any political party.
"Let me tell you that whoever you elect
Mayor, I do not care what party he is
fromâ I am not talking against one party
now or the other; I am talking against
all .parties â I do not care by what name
they are called, the man who would be
elected by you would be just as far from
you as if y_ou took him and put him up
on top of Mount Shasta.

NEW CABLE LINE
TO PHILIPPINES
Will Connect California
With Our New Island
Possessions.
Projectors Expect to Have
Wire Laid to Hawaii
Within a Year.
ALBANY, N. Y., Sept. 23.-The Com
mercial Pacific Cable Company, with a
capital stock of $100,000, was incorporated
here to-day by John W. Mackay, Clar
ence H. Mackay, Edward C. Platt, Albert
Beck, George G. Ward, Albert B. Chand
ler and William W. Cook.
Respecting the purposes and prospects
of the new company Mackay said to-day
that the Commercial Pacific Cable Com
pany had been organized for the purpose
oÂ£ - laying a submarine cable from Cali
fornia to the Philippine Islands by way
of Honolulu. The length of the cable will
be about 8500 miles, the part to be first
laid being from California to the Ha-"
waiian Islands. This portion, Mackay ex
pects, will be in operation within nine
months. The time required for the laying
of the remainder of the cable from the
Hawaiian Islands to the Philippine Isl
ands will depend upon how quickly the
cabe can be made, but Mackay believes
the 'whole cable will be completed -within
two years from this date. On August 23
Mackay made application to the United
States Government for landing rights in
California and the Hawaiian Islands and
the Philippine Islands.
The new company, Mackay announces,
is willing to lay the cable on the same
terms and conditions at San Francisco.
Honolulu and Manila, so far as landing
rights are concerned, as were imposed by
the United States Government on the
cable lines which have been landed on the
Atlantic coast of the United States. The
new company does not ask any subsidy
or any guaranty, which Is Mackay's rea
son for believing there will be no trouble
on agreeing with the Government on the
terms and conditions upon which the cable
will be landed. 1
The new cable when It reaches the Phil
ippines will connect at that point with the
present submarine cable running from
the Philippines to Japan and also
the cable running from the Philip
pines to China. A direct cable route
from China and Japan to the United
States will thereby be established. At
present cablegrams from China to the
United States have to be Bent by way of
Europe. Mackay says that the present
cable rates from the United States to the
Philippines and to China and Japan would
be reduced when the new cable is laid
from 30 to 60 per cent.
High. Price for Wiiie Grapes.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 23.â Wine grapes are
selling at a higher price in Santa Clara
County than at any time during the past
twenty years. Several contracts - were
closed on Saturday at $29 a ton, and grow
ers predict the limit has not yet been
reached. The Wine Growers' Association
Is offering $25 a ton, but independent buy
ers, to prevent being shut out. are offer
ing more. Growers have been reluctant
about accepting the $25 rate of the asso
ciation and sales have ranged from that
sum to Saturday's sale at $29, when one
of the largest vineyards i;i the southern
part of the county disposed of its crop at
that figure. It is asserted that with con
certed action among Pomona, Napa and
Santa Clara vineyard interests a rate of
$30 per ton spot cash will be in force in a
few days.

. MONTEREY, Sept. 23.â A novel method

grown rattlers in a cage in his shop for
some time. Growing tired of such dan
gerous pets, he decided to get rid of them.
He put them Into a box and threw the
box into the bay near the wharf. The
snakes speedily got. out 01! the box and
swam ashore, two of then being found
and killed in the fishermen's settlement,
but the third and largest la still at large.

pany Is negotiating for the purchase, of
the Rio Grande, Sierra Madre and Pacific
'Railroad, which. runs southwest from El
Paso to Terrazaz. in the State of Chihua
hua, Mexico. If the deal Is consummated
it is proposed to extend the acquired line
eouthweat to the port of Guaymas, on thÂ©
Gulf of California. Such purchase and.
extension would give the Santa Fe a new
direct outlet for its Oriental and much of
Its Pacific Coast â¢ business. The' Rio

was Inspected a few days ago by a party
of high officials of the Santa Fe, and they
were well pleased with Its condition and

7HREE of the most eminent leaders of the Catholic church, Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop Riordan and Archbishop Ireland, have re
cently given utterance to their 'sentiments as to tJie spirit of discontent and contempt for the supreme power of the republic fostered
by Hearst's yellow papers. ] In eulogizing the memory of the martyred President of the United States Cardinal Gibbons and
Archbishop Riordan denounced in positive language the .insults hurled at William McKiniey by the yellow sheets of Hearst.
Archbishop Ireland declared on August 9 last that the question of gbing out on strike was one that concerned personally, the men
who participated and that they had absolutely no right to interfere zvith employes outside of their ozvn ranks. . _ â¢ .
' , Archbishop Ireland declared that all disputes between employers and employes should be settled between them, but that citizens not
concerned in the dispute might hope and pray that brotherly love and calm counsel would prevail between the disputants in order to bring
peace in the land.
Last Saturday evening Father Peter C^Yorke addressed, ai mass-meeting of strikers in thL city at Metropolitan Temple. He
advocated the cause of the strikers and the unions and denounced the owners of capital and the employers of labor. He advocated a boy
cott of every one zvhom the strikers considered an enemy, and declared that the aim of employers in this city was to reduce their em
ployes to the status of chattels and slaves. ' ' J 1 _ ' . . * ,
In the face of the condemnation of the, yellow press by the distinguished prelates of the Catholic church and by the entire respec

LATE SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
BUTTE, Mont., Sept. 23.â The sliding
movement which has been doing consider
able damage to buildings and other prop
erty in different parts of Butte for sev
eral years has made it- necessary to close
the Never Sweat mine, the largest of the
Anaconda properties. It has been stated
that the deep shaft of the mine is seven
inches out of plumb, and the foundation
of the gigantic engines employed to ope
rate the mine has been so badly dis
placed that it has become unsafe to work
the engines. The foundation 'was con
structed at a cost of $40,000 and will have
to be rebuilt and the mine will remain
closed for some time. The entire Ana
conda Hill, as well as the hill upon wh'ch
the city Is built, has given frequent evi
dence of the strange movement of thc
earth, but the movement has been so
slight and gradual that no damage has
ever been done by it. Geologists claim
that the entire range of mountains about
Butte is constantly sliding and changing
and has been doing so for ages, to which
fact is due the crushed and raulty condi
tion of the veins and ore bodies of the
district.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 23.-The |
part played by the battleship
Texas in the naval battle off
Santiago July 3, 1898, in which
the Spanish fleet under Ad
miral Cervera was sunk, was the basis of
the greater part of to-day's proceedings
In the Echley naval court of inquiry. Of
the four witnesses examined during the
day three had been officers on the Texas
curing the battle and two. of them were
new witnesses. These were Commander
George C. Hellner, who was navigator on
the Texas, and Commander Alexander B.
Bates, who was the chief engineer on that
battleship. Commander Harber, executive
officer and the chief surviving officer since
the death of Captain Philip, was recalled
The fourth witness was Commandei
Seaton Schroeder. executive officer on the
Massachusetts and now Governor of the
island of Guam.
The testimony several times during the
day was somewhat exciting, as it was
especially so when Commander Heilner
described the battle and the part the
Texas had taken In it. He said that when
the Brooklyn made its loop at the begin
ning of the battle it passed across the
Texas' bow at a distance not to exceed
Wj to 150 yards, and that, at the com
mand of Captain Philip, the Texas had
been brought to a dead stop.
Engineer Bates testified that the star
board engines had been stopped and said
be thought this also had happened to the
i;ort engines. Commander Heilner ex
pressed the opinion that three miles had
been lost by this maneuver and that part
of the machinery was deranged. He said
he considered that the Texas was m
greater danger when the Brooklyn crossed
liti bow than at any other time during
the battle.
His Chart Inaccurate.
On cross-examination Commander Hell
ner admitted having taken part in the
preparation of the official Kavy Depart
ment charts showing the positions at dif
ferent times of the ships which partici
pated in the battle. He said that accord
ing to the chart the two ships never were
nearer than 600 yeards of each other. But
be contended the chart was inaccurate,
and he said he had only consented to it
as a compromise.
Engineer Bates admitted that the offi
cial steam log of the Texas contained no
record of the signal to reverse the en
gines. Commander Schroeder testified
concerning the coal supply of the Massa
chusetts, which he eaid would have been
sufficient for a blockade of from sixteen
to twenty days.
Story of Santiago Battle.
The day closed with another animated
controversy between % counsel as to the
policy of bringing Admiral Sampson'*
name into the trial.
During his testimony Heilner said that
while the Texas was not in the engage
ment with the Colon on May 31. he had
seen some of the shots from the enemy
which had fallen short.
The witness was then asked to describe
the battle of July 3, and said:
The Texas had been heading about east when
the enemy wÂ»Â« seen coming out of Santiago.
Lieutenant Bristol, who was officer of the deck
at the time, rang to go ahead full speed and
put the helm hard to starboard to make a turn.
When I got on deck he informed me of what
hud happened and I eent him below and as
turned charge of the deck. The captain told
me that he had eased their helm until they
could find which way the ships were going
and he also rang half Epeed. I suggested full
Ei-eed. He said the battery was not ready. I
told him it would be ready before the ship was
in position to fire, and then he eaid "All right"
and rang for full speed. When the second of
the enemy's ships followed the first to the
westward he put the helm hard to starboard. I
made several reports to him about the Brook
lyn regarding her signals. He said "Never
mind." I also referred to the way I thought
the Brooklyn was etanding up to fight â very
r.icely. The captain said, "Oh, crackleâ never
mind the Broklyn. You look out for this
ship." The Brooklyn then was about on her
port beam, so I said, "All right, captain. I
will look after the Brooklyn no more." After
we sheered around and got to the westward I
suggested to give her a little port helm to get
closer in and he did. Right after he gave her
this helm he pang out through the sight hole
to the men aa the wheel and the engine-room
indicator to slow, then stop, and I said, "Cap
tain, they will all get away from us." He did
not answer me. but immediately stepped back,
end then I said. "My Lord, captain, we are
out of the fight." He said, "Look at the
Brooklyn." I turned around and right ahead
of us this big gray ship loomed out of the
smoke. For a second I thought my heart was
in my mouth. "We were steaming with a heavy
helm and ehe steered by us. When I saw her
phe was practically ahead of us. That is the
flm I taw. She sheered off and went to sea.
I should say. about 2000 yards, and then on to
westward. As eoon as the Brooklyn cleared
us we rang to go ahead and started up forced
draught again. After, that we simply followed
them as fast as we could on a line that was
3<2Et inside the line where the Oregon was en
gaging the ships. Just before this turn of the
Brooklyn the Iowa and the Oregon were both
close to us on our starboard helm. We con
tinued the chase until the Colon hauled down
ier flag, when the captain gave the order to
Etop forced draught.
Greatest Danger Prom Brooklyn.
Lemlyâ How near was the Brooklyn to
the Texas at the time you say you saw
her loom up out of the smoke?
"I did not make any estimate at that
time, but I came to the conclusion later
that she was between 100 and 150 yards
from us, which was a much longer dis
tance than Captain Philip thought it
was."
Lemlyâ Perhaps I should have asked
vou in the first place the position of the
Brooklyn relative to the Texas Just be
fore going into battle?
"She was almost astern of us. That Is
because we were headed almost east. She
should have borne west by northwest.
She was heading: for the land, and. I
thought she was stationed pretty nearly
on her north course. I did not see at first
any indications of turning and I thought
she was g-oing' rieht in."
"At what time during the battle of San
tiago do you consider that the Texas was
in the greatest danger?" asked Lemly.
Raynor objected, contending that such
This is an important point with us, and we
are prepared- with the authorities to maintain
it. I am not doing this ingeniously, but 'very
frankly. Notwithstanding the strenuous ef
forts of the learned Judge advocate to keep
Admiral Sampson out of this case, he cannot
Raynor replied:
If the court please. I object to this line of
argument. It does not make one particle of
difference what any one else did. You might
as well try to, prove that somebody else com
mitted a murder and say "he committed it,
and my roan Is not to blame." It is simply a
waste of ttime. It is nowhere within the scope
of the precept. It is endeavoring to go be
yond the precept. This is not an inquiry be
tween Admiral Sampson and Admiral Schley.
It Is a question between Admiral Schley and
the morale of the sen-ice, and these compari
sons .have absolutely no bearing upon it, either
in evidence or argument, and I object to this
Ingenious attempt to extend the scope of this
precept.
The judge advocate at this point Inter
posed an objection. He said:
I<emly's Objection.
There is one other point, and this Is all done
for the purpose' of really not delaying but prop
erly getting at the matter. 'We propose to prove
that on the 1st day of June the Colon was in
precisely the same position inside of the har
bor that she was on the 31st day of May when
Admiral Schley made the reconnoissance with
the Massachusetts and the New Orleans. Now,
we propose to show that when Admiral Samp
son came ud with the ships his ships saw the
Colon in the same position and, Instead of at
tacking it, steamed by and permitted her to go
further inside the harbor. Now, would not We
be Justified in not engaging in battle with the
Colon and the shore batteries at Santiago If
Admiral Sampson took the same course?
In other words, would Admiral Schley be cen
surable for maintaining the same character of
blockade that Sampson maintained? Would
Admiral Schley be censurable for maintaining
on the 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st of May the same
character of blockade, so far as distances are
concerned, that Admiral Sampson maintained
from the day he got there on the 1st of June
until the day of battle?
We do not propose to bring the name of Ad
miral Sampson into this controversy any more
than It is possible to do so. This is not a per
sonal controversy. We are not here for the
purpose of engaging in any personal contro
versy between Admiral Sampson and Commodore
Schley or adherents of either; we are not here
for the purpose of at present, without knowing
what . this case will develop, criticizing the
actions of Admiral Sampson, but it is abso
i lutely necessary for this court, in order to prop
erly investigate this case under the specifica
tions of this precept, to let us prove what Ad
miral Sampson didâ not that we condemn what
he did or criticize what he did, or censure what
he did. We are not here now for the purpose of
condemning the fact, if it proves to be fact, of
the New York's leaving on the morning of the
battle: we are not here to criticize the blockade
that Admiral Sampson had at Santiago; but we
are here to establish this, or under the specifi
cations of your precept memorandums, to find
out whether- the blockade at Santiago was a
close or adequate blockade. Now, if we can
prove that it was, so far as distances were con
cerned, the same blockade that the commander
in chief maintained there, then we can Justify
the course of Admiral Schley, who was com
mander In chief before Sampson's arrival.
We have the absolute right' to show the situa
tion of the Xew York on the day of the battle,
and we have the right to show the connection
of Admiral Sampson in reference to the battle;
we have a right, for instance, to show that
Commodore Schley at Santiago maintained the
same sort of blockade that Admiral Sampson
maintained when he got there on the 1st of
June. So far as distances are concerned I think
we have the right to showâ because one of the
specifications of this precept statesâ whether or
not a close or adequate blockade of said har
bor to prevent the escape of the enemy's ves
sels therefrom was established.
"Did you see the New York on the day
of the battle?" was then asked.
"Oh, yes; I think she was reported
coming up before the Viscaya went
ashore. She was the last ship."
Here the judge advocate interposed to
ask the purpose of tnis inquiry.
Raynor replied that it was "to show
when the ships went there. We are go
ing to show," he continued, "the position
of thÂ« New York on the day of the
battle."
He then proceeded at some length to
outline the position of the applicant,
saying: â¢
New York the Last Ship.
Continuing, the witness said that If the
New York had shown any signals he had
not seen them.
"Looking back," responded the witness,
"I know that the time of the greatest
danger to the Texas was when the
Brooklyn loomed up out of the smoke
rigiit ahead of us."
Raynor questioned the witness at
length concerning signal lights at Clen
fueg-os, and the latter said he had not
known until after the arrival of Captain
McCalla on the Marblehead on May 24
that there was to be a system of signals
for communication with the Cuban allies
on the shore. Nor had he known until
then that Cervera's fleet was not inside
the harbor at Cienfuegos.
"Did you see any signals from the New
York on the day of the battle?" asked
Mr. Raynor.
"We did not receive any signals from
that vessel on that day until In the after
noon," replied the witness.
opinions were shut out by a previous
ruling of the court.
The court overruled- the objection and
the Question was repeated.
On re-direct examination Commander
Hellner said that the squadron had made
no effort to destroy the Spanish fortifica
tions on shore at Cienfuegos. j He said
that but for tho delay of the Texas in the
Santiago battle, caused by the Brooklyn,
the Texas would have been able to get
further in ami nearer the Colon, and
ships that wera on her bow would have
been broadside on.
I have made these remarks not for the pur
pose of arguing the question, but because the
gentlemen on the other side have argued it
and have spread their views on the records
and .then withdrawn for the second or third
time, I really forget which, this question. We
are ready to meet it when it comes, squarely
and honestly.
Hanna replied briefly, to Raynor, saying:
It is an impossibility to leave the record
in this condition without a word further. Tho
suggestion made is that Admiral Sampson's
blockade be taken as a standard, as a model,
as a type of perfect blockade, and if Admi
ral Schley's blockade comes up to that stand
ard it is to be accepted as satisfactory. We
object to taking any impertect blockade.
One. further word in regard to the sugges
tions Just made as to the intention to show
that Admiral Sampson was not in this battle.
I wish to say that we do not understand that
the question whether Admiral Sampson was
or was not in the battle of Santiago is before
the court. If it is, we shall be happy to in
vestigate it. We are here to find out all the
facts, but we do not care to roam around Into
outside matters, but if that question is led up
to In any legitimate way, or it' any line which
this inquiry institutes will lead to Admiral
Sampson and properly and legitimately bring
him before the court, we shall offer no objec
tion to the prosecution of such an inquiry!
Until the case takes that attitude it is im
proper to introduce into the examination ques
tions which proceed upon the theory that he
is in the case. . If the counsel can bring him
into the case fairly, squarely and honestly, let
that be done, and we will join them in puch
inquiries as may be necessary and proper in
the pursuit of that investigation. Until that
is regularly and squarely done, or until the
case takes such an attitude that it is neces
sary, in the fulfillment of the duty Imposed
upon this i court to make such an investiga
tion, it is idle, it is Improper and inappro
priate to introduce arguments and questions
which proceed upon that false hypothesis.
Not Fairly in Case.
The reason I do not care to argue this case
now is because I regard it as one of exceed
ing importance, and I do not think we ought
to precipitate this argument until I have fully
considered it and until some point is reached
in the case where the court must pass upon
the whole question. I may just as Well indi
cate here, first as last, what I regard to be
some of the important features of this -case.
Of course your Honors- know we proposs to
show, and I propose to show beyond all ques
tion, that Admiral Sampson from first to last
was not in the fight at all, and therefore Ad
miral Schley had thrust upon him the re
6ponsibllty of this battle, but I am not go
ing to argue it now. . So . I venture to sug
gest that when we come to a witness that
knows something about these things we will
ask him a question that will develop some
thing in regard to it, if the court then deem
proper, that that would be the best time to
argue it, and if it suits the convenience of the
court and my friend on the other side and
my assistants, I prefer to take it up then.
The judge advocate â That is perfectly
satisfactory. . ,
I will say to' the court that if we are to be
excluded now, we are to be excluded in all
of our testimony. If Admiral Schley comes
on the stand and we ask the question: "Were
you on your station on July 3?" and he says:
"I was there because Admiral Sampson put
me there," are we to be prevented from asking
that question because we are putting Admiral
Sampson into the controversy?
Judge advocateâ That I did not say.
After, some further sparring Raynor
withdrew the question, saying: that Wil
son wanted to arg-ue it before the court
and did not wish to take it up at this
time. Wilson said:
Raynor added that they further wanted
to prove that on the morning of the 3d of
July the Brooklyn had her proper station
in the blockade line under the orders of
Admiral Sampson. He did not know as
those matters could be proved by. this
witness.
Raynor further said: â¢.
Where Sampson Put Him.
Raynor â I have not .concluded. The court
cannot decide until I have concluded. We pro
pose to prove that when Admiral Schley with
drew from the reconnolssance against the
Colon and did not come in contact with the
shore batteries, he did it under a general regu
lation of the navy which required it of him,
and that Admiral Sampson passed by the
Colon at thirty minutes after 6 o'clock on
June 1 and saw her lying there and never pre
tended to attack her. Do you mean that we
have not any right to justify our conduct and
actions by the conduct and actions of the com
mander-in-chief? You will find you can't keep
Sampson out of this. You cannot keep him
constructively from the presence of this court.
You may actually, but not constructively. It
is impossible.
keep him out. I wish to be understood as not
saying one word in derogation of Admiral
Sampson, nor to censure him, but to show the
court that what we did was under the orders
of Admiral Sampson, and that he did pre
cisely t,he same things we did. I do not think
(addressing Judge Advocate Lemly) you have
any right to interrupt me in an argument.
The Judge Advocate â I want to say here,
then, that as an officer of this court, when I
think there Is an improper argument I deem It
my duty at any time to interrupt, and the
court must rule upon the fact as to whether
I am. right or not.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1901.
After a Witness Says the Texas Was More in Danger From the
Brooklyn Than the Spanish Ships, the Counsel for Schley
Clearly Outline What They Purpose to Prove to the Court
SCHLEY'S ATTORNEYS DECLARE
SAMPSON WAS NOT IN THE BATTLE
DURING the examination of witnesses before the naval court of inquiry yesterday the
attorneys for Rear Admiral Schley stated plainly that they would* prove later that
Schley's every act in the Cuban campaign had been strictly governed by the instruc
tions of Rear Admiral Sampson, the commander-in-chief of the American fleet; that Schley
maintained precisely the same kind of blockade as did Sampson after the arrival of the latter,
that Schley's failure to destroy the Spanish cruiser Colon was exactly the same stand taken by
Sampson later; that Admiral Sampson did not participate in the battle of July 3 in Santiago
Bay, when the Spanish fleet under Cervera was annihilated, Schley, who was then a commo
dore, being solely in command of the victorious ships flying the stars and stripes.

Parasites Cause All Hair Troubles.
Nine-tenths of the diseases of the scalp
and hair are caused by parasitic germs.
The importance of this discovery by I'ro-
fessor Unna of the Charity Hospital,
Hamburg, Germany, cannot be over-
estimated. It explains why ordinary ha!r
preparations, even of the most expensive
character, fail to cure dandruff; because
they do not. and they cannot, kill the
Â«3ajjdruff germ. The only hair preparation
In the world that positively destroys the
dandruff parasites that burrow up tbe
scalp into scales called scurf or dandruff
Is Newbro's Herplcide. In addition to Its
destroying: the dandruff, Â¦germ -Herplcicie
is also a delightful hair dressing, mak-
ing the hair glossy and soft as silk.

WHEN Lord Kitchener issued his famous
proclamation calling upon* the Boer leaders
Â» to surrender themselves and their com
mandos before September 15, he doubtless believed
he was near the end of his troubles; that there were
very few armed Boers in" the field, that most ' of
them were willing to cease fighting and that the
long struggle could be brought to a speedy close by
a word of warning and a threat of perpetual exile for
all who continued to fight. Such at any rate was
the belief that prevailed in Great Britain and was
sfiared by a number of British sympathizers in this
countrj'. More than one paper heralded the pro
clamation as "the beginning of the end."
The event has dissipated those delusions. It is once
more made evident that the British intelligence office
knows almost nothing of value concerning the strength
of the Boers. Instead of having but a few scattered
and fugitive commands making a desultory guerrilla
warfare the Boer leaders have time and again taken
the aggressive, have invaded Cape Colony, have
attacked fortified British posts, and since the date
which Kitchener fixed for the surrender more
Britons have surrendered to Boers than Boers to
Britons. In fact. Kitchener has had again and again
to announce with regret>tne capture of numbers of
British troops by the very men they were sent out
to take.
Under these circumstances it is not strange that
ence more the British public has become restive. It
is noted that the Boers are, seemingly at least, about
as well supplied with ammunition, with food and with
horses as ever they were. Nor do they show any
lack of men, except in those places where the British
are looking for them. In the unexpected places they
have men enough tc capture troop after troop.
Moreover, they appear to have lost nothing except
the cities and the railroads. Otherwise the country
remains in their hands. One London authority says:
"The situation is singularly like the opening of the
war two y^ars ago, the names of the same places
recurring in the dispatches. Utrecht, where Major
Gough was entrapped, was the scene of a similar
ambuscade eighteen months back. Acton Homes,
where the Boers yesterday reappeared, is eighteen
miles southwest of Ladysmith, prominent in the early
hostilities, and the Natal Colonials are mustering for
the defense of the Tugela, as when General Joubert
invaded Natal in 1899. In Cape Colony fighting is
again going on south of Stormberg, in territory
traversed by raiders and their pursuers 'half a dozen
times." " . , "
"Â¦Â¦ In addition to all the troubles that confront him
in the field Lord Kitchener has further troubles in
the camps. He has two classes of people to, provide
for. One of these is composed of the so called
loyalists, who were expelled or fled from the Boer
states, at the outbreak of the war,- and the other is
made tip of the families of the fighting Boers. The
latter have been concentrated into camps where they'
ire kept nominally that they may be fed, but really
as prisoners. The number of refugee loyalists is not
accurately known, as they are scattered about the
countrj-, but it is estimated that Kitchener has to
provide something in the way of relief for upwartf
of 50,000 of them. The Boer camps contained at
the end of July 93,940 white persons, and in separate
camps there were 25,000 Kaffirs, making 118,940
persons whom the British have to supply with food
â¢in-, addition to their own army and the refugee
loyalists." The problem is a serious one and lays a
heavy burden on the railways. It is even probable
that if the war continues much longer Kitchener will
move Â¦ all of the Boer families down to the coast
where they can be more easily fed.
Such is the situation, and now the southern winter
is about over and summer time is at hand. That
will mean a greater activity on the part of the Boers
and more trouble for the. British. It means, .in fact,
a virtual certainty that the war will continue for 1 at
least six months to come. r^r*"'

LORD KITCHENER'S TROUBLES.
therefore, 50,000 are either neutral or non-union workers andl
embrace the sufferers from the rampant savagery the 1 existence
of which our Mayor and our Governor have thus far failed to
discern.
Father Yorke not only accepts manufactured pretenses and
draws J'rom them, false inferences, but he makes a labored ef
fort to array the poor against the rich, and is betrayed into
language which, from an ordinary citizen, would rank as the
worst kind of demagogism. He speaks as a priest, however,
and claims to represent the Catholic church, and in this char
acter demands unusual consideration. In his capacity of citi
zen he had precisely the same, rights as any other citizen and
no more. In the use of his priestly functions within their just
limits he may be tolerated in the exercise of greater latitude
and he will certainly fce held to a severer responsibility.
I quote enough of his exact words to point out thl3 part off
my communication. He says: "I am here to say what good
word I can on behalf of those who do not possess this world's
goods, on behalf of those who have to labor for their daily
bread, BECAUSE I AM A PRIEST OF TILE CATHOLIC
CHURCH." He then refers to the poverty of the
Founder of Christianity, the "Man of Sorrows," and adds:
"I owe no apology to anybody to speak in behalf of
labor, but I should owe an apology to the past, to the
great men of the past, and to those who founded my
church, if I were to be found In any place except the place
where I am to-night." In another place he states "that there
is no closer union in the world than the priesthood," and that
without its consent not "a single priestly office" could be ful
filled. . .
It in beyond doubt, therefore, that Father Yorke spoke as
a pries* and representatively. But I feel equally confident that
he spoke without authority, and that for this assumed sanction
introduced into his language he does owe an apology. I am
not a Catholic,' although both as a man and a citizen, I have
a deep and abiding respect for all men who love God and his
laws and for the church which, in my judgment. In Its rela
tion to American citizenship and to Â¦ the pending struggle
Father Yorke grossly misinterpreted. I shareâ who does not?â
his enthusiasm for the poor, a class which embraces not merely
striking: unionists., but non-union workmen, and not merely
them, but many thousands of shopkeepers, traders, manufac
turers, merchants and farmers, who arÂ» suffering loss and
threatened with ruin and penury because of the attempt to
establish a despotism of selected wage-earners which Is un-
endurable in an American State. It is unfortunately true that
the poor are always with us and excite the commiseration of
all human beings who are not callous, as niagnillcent donations
and magnificent edifices all over the civilized world attest. I
will venture to assert- that there are few, if any, employers in
the United States, whether Catholics, Protestants, Jews or
even freethinkers, who do not enter into this sentiment, and it
has been and it is a source of just pride to citizens of all sects,
creeds, parties and occupations to observe the rapid diminution
of poverty and the equally rapid increase pt comfort, pros
perity, intelligence and education among the wage-earners â¢ of
our country. Even strikers, after weeks of idleness, can fondle
their watch chains, smoke cigars, patronize saloons and enjoy
life, while such of them as have families presumptively have
provided for their homes. [
-. All this may be said, and yet Father Yorke Is very wide of
the mark. There are Catholics as well as other citizens In
every business and station, and Inequality of condition, which
is quite different from inequality of opportunity or before tho
law, exists everywhere. Wage-earners will probably resent
being classed among the poor in the sense of requiring ex
traordinary. Illegal and unjust concessions from their em-
It is hard to wink at this apparently stolid ignorance of the
actual truth. No intelligent man in the United States, no citi
zen qualified to vote, ought to be unaware of the fact that
there are virtually no employers who deny or question the full
constitutional and moral right of wage-earners to establish
and Â¦ maintain labor unions and to adopt all lawful means
within their legitimate objects to make them effective. No
such dispute is involved directly or indirectly in the present
strike either as to the Brotherhood of Teamsters or any of the
unions that represent the "sympathetic"' element of the strike.
There is no controversy whatever about hours or wages or
upon any matter affecting the betterment of labor, skilled or
unskilled. There is nothing in the strike but the unreasoning
and obstinate determination of a few "leaders," surely not
American at heart, to enforce a monopoly of union labor by
restricting employers to its ranks and thus forcing all wage
earners Into the unions. This is the correct and the only cor
rect statement of the case. The methods â not formally adopted
by the strikers, many of whom are intelligent citizens, but
ruthlessly pursued by the refractory element among themâ are
destructive of all law and order and hostile to the letter and
the spirit of our system of government. I am credibly in
formed that since the local strike began there have been at
least from twelve to fifteen hundred brutal assaults upon non
union men, and that, far from having been exaggerated in the
press, hundreds of them have not even been reported. Not a
day elapses that atrocities are not witnessed on the public
streets in broad daylight, which are beyond the control of the
police. The twisting and fractures of arms and wrists with
the avowed purpose of disqualifying men for competing with
union wage-earners have been common Incidents, and some
of our merchants, not .timorous or imaginative, have to be
protected in approaching or leaving their offices. It Is Idle and
absurd to controvert by declamation what our entire popula
tion knows to be true." ;
Father Yorke Is very Incorrect In his figures even when he
estimates the number of people in San Francisco. He is doubt
less far within the . mark when he assumes the number of
workingmen in this city to be 65,000. But he is still further and
more seriously out of the way when he includes all these men
among the strikers or their spmipathizers, whose "cause" he
attempts to advocate. There are not less than 875,000 people in
San Francisco, and to allow that there are 15,000 strikers all
told is going to the furthest extreme. Of Father Yorke's 65,000,
ployers.. The rich, the poor and those in moderate circum
stances are all commingled in the vast American fraternity,
which recognizes no aristocracy of capital or labor, of wealth
or poverty. I. defy Father Yorke to show me -within the lida
of the New Testament where his Master and mine ha3 sought
to create an aristocracy of poverty or of labor. The danger
of covetousness, the special temptations of wealth and the duty
of charity, or rather love, are repeatedly enforced, but there is
no rule of exclusion applied . to the rich and all are brought
within the phrase which, as between man and man. Is the sum.
of the law and of the gospel. "Do unto others as ye would
that others should do unto you."
Father Yorke boldly attacks the presidents of both our uni
versities, who are men of high intellect, of thorough training,
of deep thought, of irreproachable character, of genuine patri
otism and of ardent sympathy with labor. Is r.o*apology duo
for this;? He also vituperates capitalists, who for many years
have successfully promoted the best Interests of workmen.
Does not this also demand an apology? And what is due for
the implied antagonism throughout his address: to the nobla
encyclical letters of Pope Leo XIII, In which the reciprocal
duties and obligations of all classes have been defined and
enforced with a precision, clearness and sincerity acknowl
edged or confessed among all civilized nations; in which the
tollers of society are warned to "be ever on their guard against
riots and the riotous, show inviolable respect for the rights of
others and work willingly and with all due respect for their
employers," and in which upon such questions the church is
restricted to "the holy task of admonishing all of their duty
according to the precepts of Christianity and ot drawing rich
and poor together In the bonds of fraternal charity " Almost
every sentence of these elevated and inspiring' documents
might be Quoted against the letter and the spirit of Father
Yorke's! ill-considered denunciations.

PERSONAL MENTION.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
These declamatory assertions may be believed by Father
Yorke, but they are simply untrue. His entire speechâargu
ment it could not be called â turned upon two assumptions of
fact, "men of straw," that have not and never had any actual
existence. I quote the verbatim report in the anarchistic or
gan, which most likely Is accurate, because Father Yorke In
dorses that paper to the extent that it Is ."standing up" for
the strikers and virtually arraigns the "entire reputable press
of the United States by charging "three of the papers" of San
Francisco, which have published the almost universal denun
ciation of the murder-inspiring articles in the Examiner, the
New York Journal and the -Chicago American, as seeking "to
injure a rival" because they thought "it would help their busi
ness and extend their circulation."
"The principle of the Employers' Association â and when I
speak of the Employers' Association I mean practically all the
capital in the city of San Francisco engaged In the wholesale
and manufacturing business, and, I am afraid, the banks also â
is that unionism must be destroyed." Thus Father Yorke de
fines the issuÂ£ on the side of the employers. . Of the other side
he says, "I believe that the . principle you are fighting for la
that unionism must be preserved."
On Saturday night last he delivered an address at Metro
politan Temple, in which he made the air blue with invectives
against the population of this city outside of the strikers and
their sympathizers, and especially against employers. -He
made no exceptions, but grouped together "all the people that
are in any way connected with business and with the Employ
ers' Association," and vociferously asserted with almost end
less reiteration that their only purpose is .to destroy labor
unions. He declared that they were "against every man and
every woman who Is earning wages in the city of San Fran
cisco, in the State of California."
As a citizen Father Yorke should remember that he lives
within and enjoys the protection of an American community,
of which the strikers constitute an insignificant minority. The
brutal criminals among them may ! break wrists, arms and
heads and beat non-union men into jelly, and thus produce
conditions with which the regular police are impoteÂ»fcÂ«to cope.
But when public officers are ready to perform their duty, and,
in any event, when the public is sufficiently aroused, they can
be and they will be controlled and punished. The American
people at no time and especially now will patiently submit to
the insplent dictation of capital on the one side or of criminal
ity, masquerading under the name of labor, on the other. Still
less will they tolerate the promotion of disorder by citizens >of
any denomination, who misconceive priestly functions. This
sentiment was the keynotev of Father Yorke's aggressive as
saults .upon the A. P. A., In which men of different sects,
creeds and parties stood by his side. He was animated by this
sentiment when he literally leaded the local press with his
letters a,nd poured out rivers of speech from -the local rostrum.
acter, and consecrated to a profession which, in its
present aspect, originated with the "Prince of Peace." Almost
immediately he became involved In controversies, in which he
attracted the sympathy of a large part of the public, because
he represented free thought, free speech and religious tolera
tion within the broad principles of the American constitution.
Now he antagonizes such men as Pope Leo XIII and Arch
bishop Riordan, sets class against class; while verbally com
mending order, in substance Incites riot and tumult; and, with
marked intensity and unexampled bitterness, parades himself
as the Western successor of Father McGlynn of New York.

the loathsome disease of yellow journalism, poisoning ; the minds of' our children and

To those questions you get your answer in the condemnation - pronounced upon
you at this' very time by the clergy of all churches, the worthy leaders of every earnest ef
fort at reform, by farmers, merchants, manufacturers and , workingmen â in short, by repre
sentatives of every church, every reform and every legitimate business interest. You tiave
hurt them all to the full extent of your cowardly maTice. You are at this very time doing
your best to stop the course of industry in California. The crops- of the farmers are ex
posed ; to ruin, merchants are losing trade, great factories are hampered in 'their work and
labor is being brought every day nearer and nearer to destitution by your incitements.
Have all these vicious utterances been but an idiot's tale full of froth and fury,
signifying nothing, or have they been the malicious incitements of a malignant egotist
"enraged against society and government because his "superiority" is not recognized?
You says the Examiner is "An American newspaper for Americans," and you ask:
"Has it assailed the- church? Has it antagonized any reform movement, or hurt at any
time any legitimate business interest?" .
Why was that lie published?
These are the questions you are to answer at the bar, of public opinion. Ycur.
offenses of the kind have been many. You have assailed not only' individuals but whole
communities and Government itself. The people of this city have not forgotten the hid
eous, grewsome, loathsome page of pictures and rhetoric which you published for the pur
pose of . representing San Francisco as the seat of the bubonic plague.
To what class of people have all of these lies day after day been addressed? Did
you think intelligent men would believe them, that good men wduld tolerate them, or that
patriotic men would be influenced by them? Isit not a fact that they were deliberately de
vised to affect the minds of the ignorant, the vile and the vicious ? Was it not your in
tention to excite that class of men to whatever course of action their cunning, their mal
ice and their brutality would suggest to them? Was it not your intention to incite
against President McKinley just the class of which Czolgosz is a type in order that they,
might commit just the crime that Czolgosz committed?
Were you not lying when you said: "Levi Strauss &' Co. are feeling the effect of
the boycott levied against it by the organized labor of San Francisco. Workingmen are
refusing to buy overalls manufactured by a firm pledged to stifle . unionism. Four
hundred of the 800 girls employed by the big Fremont-street factory" were yesterday laid
off"? Was not the lie published maliciously, and for the purpose of inciting further boy
cotts and causing further harm to California's industries?
. Was it not a lie. when you charged Chief Sullivan with saying to the police: "I
am dissatisfied with the conduct of you men toward the strikers. * Â¦ * * The strikers
must. be -driven off the streets. * * * Drive them to their homes and see that they
are kept there. * * * Let me impress this order upon you: Keep the streets clear
of union men"? Was not that a lie?
Have you not also made use of lies in attacking every one .against whom your
malice or your egotism felt aggrieved? Was it not a lie which you published in this city
but a short time ago when you charged Chairman Symmes of the executive committee of
the Employers* Association with saying: "If by reason of a struggle we are making on
a principle and in defense of individual liberty of action, the grain crop can't be moved, let
it rot"?
Did you not lie when in a grotesque caricature you represented Theodore
Roosevelt with a face like a baboon shouting out: "I am brave. I believe in shooting.
I shot a Spaniard in the back"? Was it not a lie. when you said: "Mark Hanna, acting
for McKinley, will increase the army, and if occasion arise use it against the organized
labor which he so much detests"?
Did you not lie when you said: "And McKinley â bar one girthy Princeton person,
who came to be no.more, no less, than a living crime in breeches â is, therefore, the most
despised and hated' creature in the hemisphere. His name is hooted; his figure burned in
effigy"?
Did you not lie when you said the President was "an obedient jellyfish" â "an ab
ject, weak, futile, incompetent poltroon"? Did you not lie when you said "McKinley
and the Wall street Cabinet are ready to surrender every particle of national honor and
dignity"? Was it not a lie when you said of the Philippines and Porto Rico: "William
McKinley is ruling them with an arbitrary disregard of law that George III never dared
to exhibit in America" ?
Did you not lie when you said of McKinley: "He has made the White House the
headquarters of a corrupt trust lobby. . He has made the White House the x stronghold of
tariff jobbery. It is notorious that he has mortgaged and sold the highest offices in his
gift"?. - â¢ â¢ . I
.Public opinion charges Hearst with having a responsible part in the crime of
Czolgosz by the publication of lies deliberately invented for the purpose of exciting a vin
dictive spirit against the President. To that charge Hearst is called upon to answer.
The questions put to him are these: 'Â¦â¢-.:.
The public at this time, however, is not interested in Hearst's relations to corpor
ations, to the predatory rich or to those whom he regards as incapables envious of his
superiority. The question to which an answer is wanted now is that involved an the uni
versal charge that Hearst is directly responsible for promoting a hatred of the Govern
ment and of the prosperous, thus breeding anarchists and encouraging the cowardly but
vindictive spirit that prompted the assassination of the President.
It is the claim of Hearst that he has used his papers to fight for the people against
greed and class privilege, but the people do not admit the claim. He denounces "the press
that lives on subsidies and on alms," but the public is aware that his own organ, the
Examiner, was subsidized by the Southern Pacific Company and continued to draw the
subsidy month after month until Huntington refused to pay it any further. That the
Examiner is not on the payrolls of the Southern Pacific and perhaps of other , corpora
tions to-day is due solely to the fact that the subsidies are no longer to be obtained, either
by solicitation or by extortion.
. Such is the view Hearst takes of the situation. The press of the country, presi
dents of universities, the most eminent of the clergy, Archbishops and Cardinals, Judges,
representatives of the commercial and industrial organizations of the country, are, in the
estimation of this moral idiot, subject to an infuriating envy arid jealousy of his superior
ity. An egotism of that kind can hardly be stung by anything less physical than a horse
whip, yet it is likely to be made to suffer by other means. Public condemnation may rot
sting it, but a withdrawal of public patronage will force it to silence.
Hearst divides the public that condemns him into .two classesâ the predatory rich
and their organs, and the dull incapables of journalism and of life. He says of the indig
nation of the public: "It is the revenge which inferiority takes in solacing compensation
upon superiority." â¢...;,-.
AFTER waiting two weeks\for a lull in the storm of public indignation that burst
out against him upon the assassination of the President, whom he -had reviled
and vilified day after day for years, William R. Hearst on Sunday struck back at
vthe public that condemns him. He notes that "funerals, the saddest/'
pass, and he evidently indulges the delusiomthat indignation, has passed with it. It is
clearly the belief of Hearst that since the President has been buried no one will any longer
recall the villainous and criminal attacks made upon him, and so Hearst feels it safe to re
sume. He is himself again. Once more as venomous, false and egotistical as ever.
It. matters little what the brazen impudence; overriding the cowardice of the man. may .enable
him from his retreat to say in vilification of the public that has judged and condemned him. The
end of his career is at hand..
Such are the charges the public, through the press, the pulpit, the forum and the councils of
representative business men, have made against Hearst, but it is not expected that he will answer them.
Whatever retort he makes will be the venomous stroke of a rattlesnake. He will defend his former
lies by new lies. The public is aware of the tactics he will pursue, for his character is not unknown.
He has not lived his life in a corner, nor has the darkness of his ways and the depravity of his hab
its concealed him wholly from the public. He is a known and despised man, an exile from his
home, an outcast from society, shunned by the decent and scorned by the good, the prodigal associ
ate and patron of the vilest of men and women, supporting out of his inherited wealth blackmailers
on the one hand and strumpets on the other, a discredit to his profession, a disgrace to his State, a
sore upon his party, a foe to law, order and industry, a demagogue and a coward, a slanderer of
virtue and a defamer of dignity. Rotten in body and, in heart, with an educated delight in debauch
ery and lying, he has made himself a cause of folly among the ignorant and of crime among the
vicious. Preaching a creed of hatred which the pariahs of the slums would not accept, and prac
ticing personal vices which Czolgosz would not commit, he stands doubly dyed in infamy as a cor
rupter of morals and a teacher of anarchy, and is thus abhorrent alike to religion and to law, art
offense to society* and a menace to the republic. . ' :

accosted by four men, one of whom asked
him for a light. He was about to comply
when he was struck in the face with
some blunt instrument, which felled him
like an ox in the shambles. The men
then took his watch and $20 and made
their escape.

On the night in question Wilber was on
his way home from the stables, when he
was intercepted by several strikers who
ordered him to accompany them to the
teamsters' headquarters. Finding resist
ance was useless, and hoping to meet a
policeman en route, he walked with them
to the place designated. "When they got
there, and while they were standing In a
hallway, some one said, "Now's the time;
give it to him." Acting on this advice,
the men sprang upon Wilber and felled
him. to the floor. A blow on the templo

side, breaking three ribs. After finishing
their cowardly work the strikers deserted
the place.. Wilber says he knows one of
his assailants and, although he says lit
tle, he is confident that the day of reckon
ing is not far distant.
The treatment accorded to H. D. Wil
ber, a teamster in the employ of McNab
& Smith, on September 9 was brutal m
the extreme. . He was attacked by eleven
men at Sixth and Brannan streets, and
before he was aware of what had hap
pened his nose was broken, three ribs
fractured, his shoulder dislocated and his
face and back badly cut. Wilber was un
conscious for several hours,- and for a
time his recovery was doubtful. He is
now at the County Hospital, slowly re
covering from the effect of his wounds.

The brutal assault which' was made on
Isaac Ryerson, foreman of the Joshua
Hendy Machine Works, is a striking illus
tration of the fact that the strikers exer
cise little discrimination in selecting their
victims. Ryerson, as foreman of an iron
works, was ineligible to become a member
of the Machinists' Union, and therefore
he could not be called out on strike. This
fact, however, did not prevent, the strik
ers from waylaying him and forcing him
to undergo the most fiendish torture.
Ryerson, accompanied by Frank Bollo,
assistant foreman of the Joshua Hendy
Machine Works, after finishing their
day's work boarded a Union street car on
August 26 to go to their homes. At the
corner of Buchanan and Union streets
Bollo got off the car. Four men. who had
evidently been following Ryerson and

Bennett is now at the County Hospital
with his limb encased in a plaster of parts
cast. He declines to discuss the incident,
fearing he will be attacked again when
he gets out. In addition to a broken leg
Bennett received three cuts about the
head and numerous severe bruises about
the body.
Joseph Bennett, a special policeman,
had a disastrous encounter with strikers
three weeks ago. He was escorting a
non-union teamster along Brannan street
when a crowd of strikers surrounded the
truck and began to obstruct the progress
of the vehicle. Bennett was obliged to
get off the truck, and ere he was able
to offer resistance he was clasped from
behind and thrown down: His revolver
was taken from him and he was beaten
about the head with the weapon. Two of
the strikers then deliberately sprang upon
and broke his right leg near the ankle.
The police arrived at this juncture and
the mob scattered.

FRACTURE HIS ANKLE.
Bollo, though not so fiendishly aealt
with as Ryerson, was still severely in
jured. Two of his, brothers are members
ofthe' striking unions. <V . .-
As Ryerson did not arrive home at the
usual time his wife went to look for him.
She found him lying on the sidewalk un
conscious and covered with blood. Al
though this assault took place several
weeks ago the injured man was only yes
terday able to return to work. For almost
fifteen years he has been a machinist in
this city, but he was unable to recognize
any of his assailants. This leads to the
supposition that they were thugs hired
by the strikers for the occasion.
Ryerson, on seeing that his friend was
absolutely helpless in the hands of his
assailants, jumped from the car to go to
his assistance, but he also was immedi
ately attacked by three other strikers,
who also dismounted from the car. Ryer
son was thrown and the thugs beat him
about the head, either with sharp stones
or brass knuckles, attempting in their
brutal torture to blind him. Ryerson was
already blind in his left eye and to hide
the defect he wore a glass eye. This the
strikers mistook for his perfect eye and
drove the glass sphere into his head. Not
satisfied with this torture they split one
of his .fingers of his right hand to the
bone.
In beating Bollo the strikers employed
a bludgeon, which had been prepared for
the occasion. This weapon, which is now
in possession of the police, resembles the
leg of a chair with a hard rubber pad cov
ering over one end, held in place by an
iron spike. Although Bollo is a hardy
athlete and di;l his utmost *to escape pun
ishment he was struck no less than eight
times with this instrument of torture.

The developments in the strike of the
teamsters yesterday were most encour
aging to the employers. It was ascertained
that four fruit teamsters, all members of
the Brotherhood of Teamsters, returned
to work yesterday, notwithstanding that
they were warned that personal violence
might follow such a course.
It is confidently expected that seven or
eight additional fruit teamsters will re
turn to their teams within a day or two
and that a general stampede will follow.
It is well known that many of the team
sters would return to work were it not for
.e fear of being waylaid and beaten.

Preceding the conference Mayor. Phelan
was in consultation with the Grand Jury,
and the condition of the city as to peace
and safety of the public was considered.
The Mayor was asked if no steps could
be taken to stop the assaults that occur
daily and protect the citizens from fur
ther harm at the hands of gangs of strik
ers. The Mayor replied that he was to
confer with the strike leaders relative
to the matter during the day, and further
inquiry along that line was postponed
pending the result of the conference.
The action of Chief of Police Sullivan
in ordering- the police along the water
front to strictly enforce the laws and
to promptly arrest all violators, be they
strikers or otherwise, was the subject of
a conference in Mayor Phelan's office

MUST PRESERVE PEACE.
On the other hand, the leaders of the
iron strikers assert that no committee has
been authorized to negotiate the settle
ment of the strike on any basis whatever.
Notwithstanding this sweeping denial,
however, it is claimed that the machinists
have evinced a desire to accept the nine
hour schedule, and that they are willing
to return to work on a basis of nine hours
with nine hours' pay. This the members
of the Iron Trades Council emphatically
deny, they claiming that the report was
circulated by the employers in the hope
of causing a break among the machinists.
It is known that the executive commit
tee of the local union has had the nine
hour proposition under consideration for
some time past, but no decisive action has
thus far resulted. Many of the striking
machinists have declared their willingness
to return to work on the Basis proposed,
but in the absence of official recognition
of the plan they are powerless to act. The
strikers have been out of employment
since May 20, and there is great destitu
tion in consequence among those who
have families to support. It is generally
believed among the Iron men that the end.
of the strike is near, and the situation
lrom the employers' standpoint, therefore,
Is full of promise. * Â¦
The managers of the principal Iron
works decline to discuss the matter on the
ground that the developments at this date
are such as to prohibit their discussion.
They declare that they will agree on only
one basis for settlement, namely, a re
sumption of operations according to the
schedule in force at the time the strike
was inaugurated.
A committee from the â¢ boiler-makers,
blacksmiths and iron-ship builders is
negotiating with the members of the
Metal Trades Association with a view to
ending the machinists' strike. The com
mittee has visited many of the leading
employers and requested a conference at

is reported, little progress to that end has

His arm is almost useless, and he suffers

had no interest in the strike, one way

C. A. Poe, a racing man lately em-
Ployed in Costello's Stables, is at the City
and County Hospital. On the evening of
the day of his arrival in the city, two
weeks ago, he ventured along Howard
street alone, idly smoking a cigarette and
blissfully unconscious of trouble ahead.
He stopped at the corner of Fourth and
began to roll another cigarette. A man
approached him and surveyed him hastily.
Presently he made a sign, and in the
next instant a dozen men came rushing
upon the scene. Poe looked about him to
ascertain the cause of the excitement,
when without the slightest warning he
was hit on the head with a club.

of the City Front Federation. It is the
result of this searching,, that makes the
police skeptical. The "result" now forms
an interesting part of the Police Depart
ment's collection of the weapons em
ployed by the modern knight of the road,
,by the up-to-date footpad. The Call to
day produces photographs of a few of
these weapons.
These weapons were all but two taken
from the persons of union pickets on
duty. Two of them were picked up by
the side of unconscious victims of strik
ers violence. Some of them are clubs
rudely fashioned from billets of wood,
some are made from gas pipes,' some
loaded with lead, and all constructed with
the same deadly purpose, /all of them
capable of dealing the death blow to the
non-union victim unfortunate enough to
come within range.
The majority of these deadly weapons
were taken from pickets stationed along
the water front. When the union forces
first commenced using violence the police
contented themselves with disarming the
pickets. This started the collection. The
violence increased, however, and the po
lice adopted more vigorous tactics. The
collection is now large and receives addi
tions every day.
One of the weapons, a neatly construct
ed slungshot, was found on the person of
Lawrence Larson on August 27. The
charge of. carrying a concealed weapon
was dismissed in the Police Court because
Larson declared that he had found it on
the street. One of the most villainous of
them all consists of a club over one end
of which has been forced a ball of hard
rubber. This was used in beating Frank
Bulls and J. Rlerson on Union street on
August 26. Fred Hefferman, a non-union
engineer, was beaten in front of his home
at Green and Larkin streets on Septem
ber 7 with still another of the weapons
now In the poMce'collection. This particu
lar pro-union argument was constructed
of two lengths of gas pipe wrapped in a
sheet of the San Francisco Examiner.
A piece of rubber hose plugged at one
end with a peach stone also figures in the
collection. One picket was provided with
a two-foot length of steel cable, another
with an ebony ruler suspended to a stout
cord. The brass faucet of a beer barrel
figures as the foundation for one of the
weapons, while table legs, chair legs and
other, articles of domestic use' have been
pressed into the service.

After some further discussion' the party
separated with the understanding that the
police would be sustained officially and
otherwise. The strike leaders agreed to
urge a more conciliatory- policy upon the
strikers, although they were of the opin
ion that the recent assaults were the
work of hoodlums rather than the rank
and file of the strikers themselves.
supported by all good citizens In prevent
ing it. Their plan was to keep the streets
safe for those who pass by. He told Â¦ the
leaders that it was an established fact
that no man suspected of being a non
union employe was safe on the streets;
that they were stopped and asked wheth
er they were union men or non-union
men, or whether they would give up their
work or not, and if the answer was not
satisfactory they would receive serious
and sometimes mortal injuries. The po
lice were trying to prevent this by the
best possible means, and the Mayor asked
the leaders of the strike to assist the po
lice in preventing these outrages.
A gang of -strikers yesterday morning
opened fire, from a window on Howard
street, near First, on Special Officer Ellis
and a non-union j teamster. None of the
shots took effect. Ellis, who is employed
by the^Overlanrl , Transfer Company, was
riding on a truck accompanied by the
non-union teamster when suddenly a bul
let whizzed past his head. Before he had
a chance to draw his revolver six more
shots rang out in quick succession. . The
teamster, becoming frightened, jumped
from the truck and disappeared down the
street. . Ellis returned the fire, but as far
as is known none of the attacking party
was hit. As soon as the police learned
of the dastardly attempt to murder Ellis
and the teamster a large posse of officers
was sent to the scene. They made a
thorough search for the murderous strik
ers but failed to find them. Ellis says he
recognized one of the men and to-day he
intends to swear out a warrant for his
arrest.
A striker concealed In a lumber yard at
Fifth and Brannan streets about 10
o'clock succeeded ,in keeping people in
that vicinity in a state of terror for sev
eral minutes. He opened fire on Special
Officer Michael Burke, who was guarding
a non-union teamster driving a truck for
the Overland Transfer Company. The spe
cial officer fired several return shots, but
neither his fire nor that of the concealed
striker took any effect. When the police
arrived on the scene the striker had dis
appeared. Â¦
fAt the corner of Third and Brannan
streets, where a crowd had congregated,
a striker fired a- number of times at a
special and a non-union teamster in the
employ of McNab& Smith. The special
did not hesitate to return the fire, but as
far as is known his bullets flew wild. One
of the bullets Â¦from the striker's revolver
entered the home of Mrs. A. B. Johnson,
who resides at 415 Brannan street, and al
most struck her In the head. When the
special officer commenced to fire the
strikers fled into some of the neighboring
yards. -

public officials and speakers, that the city

futed in a forceful manner in the danger
district south of Market street. Three
fusillades that occurred in the morning
served to startle residents in the vicinity
of the Brotherhood of Teamsters' head
quarters. Fortunately ho one was struck
by the flying missiles, but during the
shooting a state of terror prevailed among
householders in the line of fire.

San Bernardino County "Woman Has
Unfortunate Experience With
a Revolver.
SAN BERNARDINO. Sept. 23.â Two
bright eyes, shining like balls of lire at
the side of the road in Waterman canyon,
were the cause of a bullet wound in Mrs.
Switzer's left leg. The woman and her
son came down from Geurnsey's Mill In
the mountains on Saturday, to see the cir
cus. At dusk they started on the lonely
return trip.. When just above Vales Camp
In Waterman canyon, Mrs. Swltzer no
ticed the shining eyes of what she be
lieved to be a mountain lion at the side
of tho road. She thought the beast was
about to leap upon her, and hastily drew
and cocked a revolver. She put the wea
pon in her lap while she tightened the
reins of her horse.
At that moment the revolver was dis
charged, and the bullet plowed its way
entirely through the fleshy part of Mrs.
Swltzer's left leg, between the knee and
thigh. The lion Immediately disappeared
and could be, heard rapidly picking its
way through the brush.
Mrs. Swltzer returned to the city, ar
riving at midnight, and had her wound
dressed by Dr. Colllver. She is 45 years
of age, and her husband works at the
mill In the mountains.

Cloud Rutter, scientific assistant of tho
United States Fish Commission, has been
sent to this coast for the purpose of In
vestigating the habits of salmon. He has
established headquarters on the Sacra
mento River, near Rio Vista, and is al
ready at work. The rate of migration of
salmon and their loss of weight in swim
ming from the river mouths to spawning
grounds have been u subject for much un
otllclal study by both the State and Na
tional commissions for the last two years,
nnd Mr. Kutter will gather the necessary
material for statistics.
The adult fish will be caught by means
of gill nets. , Their weight will then be
determined to the third of an ounce. After
the fish have been branded with numerals
on tho right operculum they will be lib
erated and will be retaken at the^ spawn
ing grounds, where they will be again
weighed. Comparison with the previous
figures will determine the exact loss of
weight on the trip. Mr. Rutter will con
tinue his work throughout the season
while the salmon arc running at Rio
Vista.
This is the first official- inquiry which
has been made into the subject, and re
sults will be watched for with a great
deal of interest by those engaged in pisca
torial study. When the present Investiga
tion has been completed Mr. Rutter pur

The Big Basin Lumber Company haa
concluded not to charge tho Stute $100 per
acre for' the lands in the Big Basin in
Santa Cruz County. This fact is brought
back from the Big Basin by tho Redwood
Park Commissioners and the members of
the advisory committee, who went down
to find out for themselves whether the
basin was adapted for a park. Mr. Mld
dleton, who acted as spokesman for tho
Big Basin Lumber Company, agreed to
shade off the price to $S0 per acre, so says
one of the advisory committee members.
At this rate a clean cut was made of
$50,000 from the price asked at the time
The Call began to look into the real value
of the basin timber lands, for which it
has since been abundantly abused by cer
tain newspapers and individuals. The
tract, for which $250,000 was to be paid by
the State if the Commissioners agreed to
give tho lumber company's price, com
prised 2500 acres. It is ascertained that
some of the best of this land was bonded
tor HO per acre by the company.
The commission has not decided to take
any particular tract for a park. The
Commissioners and advisory committee
visited only that part of the basin that
has been opened up by trails, the re
mainder being Inspected by the timber ex
perts employed by the commission. One
of the gentlemen of tho official party says
that there are several conditions prece
dent to the acceptance of the lands. One
is that both Santa Cruz and Santa Claru
counties shall construct roads to the
basin. Another is that .enough land shall
be acquired in addition to the tract now
marked out by the Big Basin Lumber
Company to make the exterior boundaries
symmetrical. The lumber people offer
now to furnish 700 acres in addition to the
original tract. The Commissioners be
lieve that it will be possible to acquire
1S00 acres more at a rate of about $10 per
acre. If this could be accomplished the
State would have a park of 5000 acres in
stead of one of 2500 acres, and all for the
price that it has been proposed to charge
for 2500 acres. The official party that vis
ited the Big Basin included the following
named:
Commissionersâ Governor Gage, Rev. Father
Kenna. Professor Dudley of Stanford Uni
versity. A. \\\ Foster and \V. H. Mills. Ad
visory committeeâ N. P. Chliirnan, J. U. Ham
mond. Drury Melone. Hervey Llndley and W..
W. Van Arsdale.
The commission will meet soon to re
ceive the report of the timber experts. No
proposition will be considered that does
not include possession by the State of the
west fork of tho Waddell Creek within
the park boundaries.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
Shipping' Merchants.
NEWS OP THE OCEAN.
It was rumored on the front yesterday
that Captain Stores, who brought the
steamship Edith here from the East last
week, was going back to bring out the
big collier Roma. It was also said that
Captain Hall of the South Portland was
to take command of the Edith. James
Jerome, manager of the vessel, says that
nothing has been settled and that the
Roma may be kept on the Atlantic, coast.
The anchor and chain lost by the En
terprise was picked up by the tug Sea
King yesterday.
The Portland steamship George "W. El
der is scheduled to sail on the 28th lnst.
for the Columbia River. She will be the
first of these vessels to carry passengers,
and should the venture prove a success
all of the fleet will carry passengers as
well as freight. Ever since the strike the
vessels hate been going out with freight
only. -
Water Front Notes.
Captain Mclntosh of the schooner Arago
will be around town again in a day or
so and congratulations will be in order.
The Arago left here last spring for the
codfishlng banks and Captain Mclntosh
was in hopes of making a record catch.
The latter part of May the schooner was
caught In a terrific storm and had to be
hove to. A wave washed Captain Mcln
tosh from the poop and when he was
picked up the mate thought him dead.
He was taken below and showed signs of
life. An examination showed that an arm
and nearly all the ribs on one side were
broken; that the scalp was laid open and
six front teeth were gone. The captain,
when consciousness was restored, refused
to turn back and the Arago went to the
banks, where she took 75,000 fish. On her
return here Captain Mclntosh was sent to
the Lane Hospital by Lynde & Hough,
owners of the vessel, where his arm had
to be rebroken, the rough edges chiseled
off and reset. It is now all right again
and he will be out to-morrow. In spite
of the mishap, he Is going back to Bering
Sea next spring.
A Plucky Master Mariner.
A telegram to the Merchants' Ex
change, dated the 22d lnst., reports the
United States army trannport Buford
athoro on a sandbar off tho Island of
Mindanao. Tugs havo been sent to her
RBKlmanco and tho chances are uho will
be itot off without much damage.
The ttuford Hoems to bo playlns: in hard
luck. On her way hero from Nnguflakl
the cool supplied her tit that point wan
so poor that Hhn could not mako speed
and had to put Into Honolulu for a but
ter supply. Bho oailcd from here aguln on
July 10 and again had to put Into Hono
lulu with a damaged cylinder. Manila
was made prior to August 1C, and ufter
discharging the orders wero given for her
to go around the islands, pick up tho
Seventeenth Infantry and take them to
New York via the Suez canal. She left
Manila on September 16 and must have
had nearly all the men of tho Seventeenth
aboard when she struck. From Mindanao
she would probably havo gone to Singa
pore and thence by way of China to the 1
Mediterranean.
TRANSPORT IN TROUBLE.
Goes Ashore on a Sand Bar Near the
Island of Mindanao.
Among the departures were the British
6hlp County of Inverness for Queenstown
with wheat, the barkentlne W. H. Dimond
for Honolulu with general merchandise,
the collier Asuncion for Seattle and the
steamship Umatllla for Puget Sound
pens.
Another arrival was the brig John D.
Spreckels from the Carolines with 275 tons
of copra. She left here May 5 for Guam
and after discharging there. went to the
German possessions. After, securing a
cargo by trading she sailed from Kusaie
last month and made the run home in 37
days. Captain McNelll says everything
was culet in the Carolines and at Guam
when his vessel wan there.
Among the vessels that made port was
the ship Two Brothers from Bristol Bay
with a carsro of 32,200 cases of salmon.
Early in the morning it blew from the
northwest and that brought her off port.
Then the wind changed to the southwest
and she sailed in. The Two Brothers is
one of the best known vessels on the
ccast and generally makes a good run.
Adverse winds lengthened out the passage
from Bristol Bay to 26 days on this occa
sion.
IT was blowing hard off shore yester
day and in consequence very few
vessels made port. The wind was
from the southwest, however, and
that gave several deep water ships a
chance to get out. The cruiser Philadel
phia went out about 4 p. m. and met a
leng, heavy roll off Fort Point that must
have made the Naval Reserve boys who
are aboard think that deep sea sailorlng
is not all beer and skittles. The militia,
sixty-four strong, went aboard the war
ship about 11 a. m. and the time from then
up to the hour of sailing was used In get
ting the men installed in their quarters.
As soon as that was accomplished the
seven-day cruise was begun.

A motion for a new trial made by the
attorneys for the Union Iron Works In
the case of Henry Grundel, Â¦who was
awarded damages for the death of his
son, who was an employe of the Sloane
Furniture Company, was denied by Judge
Hunt yesterday. Young Grundel was
killed at the Potrero works. The damages
were awarded by a Jury, and the attor
neys on the losing side asked for a new
trial -on the ground that -. the <Â¦ man who
was killed was not an employe, of the
works; that he' was there In the inter
est of a third party, and therefore the
Union Iron Works should not be held
responsible for his death.
Judge Hunt,. however, held that a man
who enters the premises of Â¦ another for
the purpose of transacting .business "is
not . a i mere -licensee, .". but one. to whom
the owner of the premises owes some ob
ligations and duty. :.
The question was also raised by the at
torneys for the works that the vessel
on which the man was killed was not
the property of the Union Iron Works.
Judge Hunt decided that until the boat
was turned over to purchasers it -was, tcr
all intents and purposes, the property of
the builder. .

Mrs. Ellen RipleyXhapiairi^dieiAWi.'
Grand Army of the, Republic* No, 7^ Â£23
10th Ave., N. R, Minneapolis, ''Minn.*
Strongly Endorses Pinkham^;
Vegetable Compound.
41 Dear Mrs. Pixkham .âYour Vegetable Compound oired4*A
of ulceration 6i the womb, and getting such a complete cure I felt \ha\
the medicine had genuine merit and was well worth recommending
to other sick women. . '
" For fifteen years I have been your friend. I have never written yoij
before, but I have advised hundreds of women to take your medicine, (4
fact it is the only real reliable remedy I know of for a sick woman/
" I have not yet found a case of ovarian or womb trouble which
has not been relieved or cured by the faithful use of I^ydia E.
i'inkhsiin's Vegetable Compound.
" You havo brought hc.ilth to hundreds of women in Minneapolis aa
you have no doubt to others, over the country " â Mrs. Ellen Ripley,
$5000 FORFEIT IF THE ABOVE LETTER IS NOT GENUINE.
"When women ure troubled with Irregular or lwiinful menstruntion t
w (ilk ness, leucpfrhqxu displacement or iilcemlion of the womb, that bear*
in/T-down feeling, influnnimtion of the ovaries, backache, flatulence,
{Tsneml debility, indigestion, and nervous prostration, they sliould )
remember there is one tiied and true remedy. Lyriia E. PinkliamV
Vegetable Compound at once removes such troubles. ; /
No other medicine in the world has received such widespread and
unqualified endorsement. No other medicine has such a record of cure*,
of female troubles. Refuse to buy any other medicine.

few railroad stocks, but It was abandoned In
the face of the persistent and heavy liquida
tion In Amalgamated Copper, and the market
turned weak. The net losses run between 1 and
over 2 points in quite an extended list of im
portant stocks. Such a violent decline as that
of Amalgamated Copper is bound to affect the
stock market by sympathy, whatever the condi
tions elsewhere. The Amalgamated Copper
movement grained influence by reason of collat
eral inferences drawn from it by epeculators.
Although a highly manipulative specialty, the
stock has been more favorably regarded than
some other industrials by reason of the in
fluential character of the control of the com
pany. The reduction in the dividend and the
collapse in the price have led to flying rumors
of shortcomings in management and finances
of the same character recently disclosed by
several of the minor industrials. The effect
was to engender distrust of all the industrials
and their blind pool methods. Also the reduc
tion of the ' Amalgamated dividend, following
the conservative refusal by partly Identical
interests to advance the St. Paul dividend,
was taken as a broad Indication of the indis
position of. Standard Oil capitalists to stimu
late a rise in prices. As the fact has been
obvious that insiders were advancing the Mor
gan railroad properties and the Gould proper
ties. Southern Railway. Erie and Manhattan
continuing an advance even this morning,
speculators were inclined to draw an inference
of renewed discord among the great financial
powers whose quarrel precipitated, the North
ern Pacific corner. In addition, the Govern
ment fiscal operations are not expected to yield
*-uch resources to the money market as was
the case last week, while the heavy movement
of currency to the interior continues. Another
day of reverses to the British arms in South
Africa seemed to bring home to the London
market that they must face another Govern
ment loan at an earlier period to meet the
protracted war expenditures there. This brings
another element of doubt into, the problem of
the amount of gold which foreigners will part
with for th? coming import movement to New
York. The advance in the discount rate to
day by the Imperial Bank of Germany was an
other element. The foreign exchange rate
hardened to-day, ending the talk of further
immediate engagements of gold. The market
closed weak. ._
Railroad bonds were strong early, but be
came irregular as stocks turned weak. Total
sales. $2,575,000.

The preliminary examination of John
Harris, charged with having embezzled
four mail sacks, was held yesterday be

Heacock. ' The testimony showed that
Harris had used the. sacks to pack vege

dence, and that he had returned the sacks
within twenty-four hours of the time of
taking them. Judge Heacock discharged
the prisoner. He said that while he was
convinced; that Harris was technically
guilty, he was doubtful whether, under
the circumstances . of the case, a convic
tion could be had, before a Jury. Before
discharging Harris Judge Heacock warn
ed him against repeating the offense.

Reliance Club Prepares for a Large
;Â¦.. Attendance at the Jeffries-Ken.
Â¦":Â¦ nedy Go. 'jSi^'Cx
OAKLAND, Sept. 23.â The Reliance Club
has made provision for seating a blj;
crowd to-morrow night to witness the
lour-round go between Jeffries and Ken
nedy. The champion purposes stopping
his opponent inside of the limit or for
feit $100.
Kennedy declares he will make a fight
Â¦while he is in the ring. His supporters
say they are confident of their man's pur
pose to keep close to Jeffries, and that is
the prospect which lends interest to the
match.
As preliminaries the club furnishes two
ten-round bouts, the first between Kid
Johnson of San Jose and Arthur Gran
f.eld and the second between Louis Long
of the Reliance Club and "Kid" Chinner
<jf San Francisco. Reserved seats can be
R^cured at Rosenbere's cigar store on
Broadway or at Harry Corbett's place in
Pan Francisco.
The end of the strike here clears trans
bay freight traffic of the obstacles which
for two months had interfered with the
free handling of merchandise. Both sides
are well satisfied that the , strife ceases
and that business can resume its normal
condition so far as the handling of freight
between San Francisco and the east side
of the bay is concerned. The calling off
of the " strike affects Oakland, Alameda,
Berkeley, San Leandro and Haywards on
this side of the ,bay, these cities and
towns depending much upon local trans
fer express companies to haul goods.
they would not treat with the union ex
cept upon such terms as the company de
cided to adopt.
Vice President Barlow of the express
company said this afternoon that the
teamsters whom he cared to take back
to work would be put on the wagons to
morrow morning. He explained that he
was employing the men in their individual
capacity, and it was upon that basis only
that he had consented to receive their ap
plications.
The People's Express Company flatly
refused to take any part in any agree
ments relative to the employment of
union men. The company declared it
would not consent to discharge the non
union men who had been working during
the strike, nor would it order them to
join the union.
Conferences were held during the day
between Business Agent Johansen of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters and Mr. Bar
low, the outcome being that such men aa
the company desires to take back will be
hired by Barlow as he chooses to select
them without reference to their union af
filiations.
Stella Lee Is a bright, particular star in
a firmament of good things presented at

known to the dancer's art, and her agile
limbs are in motion -for fifteen minutes
without cessation. Her sand jig raised
the enthusiasm of the audience to a high
pitch last night and proved a clever fea
ture of the performance.
The Svengalis succeeded in mystifying
everybody with their exceedingly clever

A moral nightmare, a dream of delirium
tremens, a peep into a dark corner of In
ferno, a chapter almost from the life of
Jack the Ripper, is "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde" as portrayed by Joseph Haworth
last night at the Grand Opera-house.
Throughout the performance the crowded
house was thrilled with horror and ad
miration â the first for the demon -in hu
man form, the second for the splendid
work of the actor. Admirable ir.deed is
the art with which Mr. Haworth portrays
the opposite characters of the principal in
the play, and he not only acts the oppo
sites with rare skill, but he looks them as
well. In the lightning change in the third
act, when Hyde becomes Jekyll in the
arms of Dr. Lanyon, the transformation
is so complete and so startling from the
hideous, sallow complexioned dwarf to
the frank-faced, tall and manly appearing
Grand Opera House.
Booths will be ercted for the sale of re

they will be in charge of young ladies

that was struggling in the woman's grasp
and landed the man safely on deck.
Then Mrs. Krauth," relieved of her bur
den, gave way to^nervous hysteria. Ladies
took charge of the half-fainting woman
and her husband was turned over to male
passengers.
The steamer was again put in motion
as soon as Captain Leale was notified of
the cause of the trouble and continued its
interrupted journey to Alameda mole. A.
G. Dexter of Alameda assisted In the task
of getting Mrs. Krauth and her husband
to the home of relatives in that city. She
was completely prostrated and was put
under the care of a physician. Krauth
was sent to the Southern Pacific Hospital
In San Francisco to be attended, as he
was suffering from a serious nervous

There was another large -audience at

this author never lose their popularity.
"A Texas Steer" is the best of all of
them. Hoyt's pieces are all funny in

Factional Fight Not Settled.
The effort to settle the factional fight
that has arisen in the Oakland Building
Trades Council failed at a conference
held last night in that city. The "executive
committee of the San Francisco Building
Trades Council was present to take a
hE.nd in the proposed settlement of differ
ences, but its proffered services were of
no avail. After discussing the situation
for hours the committee adjourned with
ot.t accomplishing anything except to
agree that another conference should be
held. The trouble in the Oakland com
ntttee is due to the efforts of J. H. Mul

fight for re-election last week, to secure
cor.trol of the committee and get back
in :6 office again. The faction led by D. A.

The" last* week of the engagement of
Miss. Florence Roberts at the Alcazar
Theater commenced last night, when
"Sapho" was reproduced to a house
packed to its utmost capacity. This is
probably the Sjest emotional part played
by this talented actress, and she seems
to improve, if that were possible, every
time the piece is presented. The audience
was so wrought up w^en she was plead

act to let her ttax with him that hand
kerchiefs were very much in use, and a
young lady in one of the boxes became
hysterical. Jean Gaussin was represented
by Lucius Henderson, and he gave a very
clever interpretation Â¦- of the part all
through. Carlyle Moore was equally ef
fective and convincing as Flamont, and
gives promise of much better things in
the future. George Webster, Barton Hill

DASH AT HAWTHOENE
A telephone message was received at
the Central police station yesterday after
noon about 2 o'clock that there was trou
ble at First. and Natoma streets. Sergeant -
Donovan and two policemen drove to the
scene in the patrol wagon. It developed
that one of McNab & Smith's drivers,
named Sheldon, was unloading a truck
load of machinery at 52 Natoma street
when a crowd of women, backed up by
two hoodlums, took possession of the
truck. The- two hoodlums attacked Spe
cial Officer -Blair and the driver. B*air
drew his revolver and kept them at bay.
Sheldon also drew his revolver, but later
disappeared. Sergeant Donovan and the
officers soon cleared the street and re
mained till the_ truck was unloaded.
Edward Le Fevre, 213 Buena Vista
street, a striking machinist, secured a
warrant from Judge Cabaniss yesterday
for the arrest of Joe King, the ex-pugilist,
on a charge of battery. He said that King
had brought nine machinists from the
East for the RIsdon Iron Works, and
while King was walking along Michigan
street with foiir. of the men Le Fevre,
who is a union picket, spoke to one of the
men. King, he said, struck him in the
face three times and knocked him down.
His upper lip was slightly puffed from the
blows. Bail was fixed at JoO. I
The case of Alvin Smith, stationary en
gineer, charged with assault to murder
for striking Fred Muffelman, engineer for
Healy, Tibbits & Co., on the head with a
piece of leadpipe, was called in Judge Ca
ba.nlss' court yesterday. Muffelman was
in court with his head bandaged and he
presented a pitiable spectacle. He was so
weak that he had to lean his head on the
back of the seat in front of him. Dr.
George Adam, who is attending MunTel
man, was called to the stand and testified
that it would be at least a week before
Muffelman would be able to testify owing
to his weakened condition. The Judge
thereupon continued the case until Fri
day. October 4.

STRIKEHS IN OOUI&.
NABUCCO," picturesque, melo
dramatic, brassy, noisy, violent,
the first opera whereby Verdi'
gained recognition, antedating
"Falstaff" by fifty-one years,
was given for the first time in San Fran
cisco last night. To the enterprising lit
tle opera-house on Eddy street we, of
course, owe this opportunity of comparing
Verdi at his youngest with the mature
genius who gave lis "Otello" in 1587, and
with a lively expectation of favors " to
1 come we avow our gratitude therefor.
The only logical thing for the Tivoli now
to do is to put on "Falstaff," by happy
coincidence one of Salassa's good parts,
and so give us the first and last operas of
the splendid old Italian maestro.
"Nabucco" was very favorably received
last night by an enthusiastic house; the
first act, by much the best, closing with
a half dozen curtain calls, and the fine
overture was also greeted with strong ap
plause. "Nabucco" is a curious opera,
containing neither love story, nor tragedy,
and thereby hangs the tale of its dis
appearance from the stage, for the music
is by no means inferior to many operas
that have had much longer life than this
first child of Verdi's genius. It has two
great parts, however, which explains its
sometime appearance on the stage, and
explains further its present production at
the Tivoli, the parts of Nabucco and
Abigail. Salassa has the role of Nabucco,
and though his work in it is not so great
as his conception of Iago, it is yet a pow
erful and interesting interpretation.
He sang splendidly last night, with that
vibrant, resonant voice of his, and though
the lightning did not work when it should
have struck off his crown the performance
was otherwise free from disaster of any
kind. Barbaresohi is a noble figure as tfte
usurping daughter of Nabucco. and Jooks
unusually handsome and imposing. The
role suits her all through, vocally and
dramatically, and the opera is worth
hearing if alone for the work of these
two â Barbareschl and Salassa. Dado adds
another to the good things he has done
during the season by a thoroughly artistic
rendering of the part of Zaccaria. the high
Â§riest; Pollettinl is a graceful Fenena, the
aughter of Nabucco; Cortezi is a pleas
ing Ismaile and Napoleoni is efficient in
the part of the high priest of Baal. Ar
thur Boyce's Italian is apparently home
made.
The chorus does the good, fresh work
that it always seems to do in a new
opera, and Mr. Steindorff and the orches
tra deserve hearty praise for their useful
efforts.
"Hamlet" Is in preparation, with Salas-
Tfte attorneys in the case think it will
require several days- to secure a jury to
try Adams. A special panel of jurors may
be necessary.
When the afternoon session closed only
three men had been secured as temporary
jurors. They were A. A. Demars, Augus
tin Bernal and L. Lemekin. They may be
dismissed, however, when the peremptory
challenge privilege is exercised by the at
torneys on both sides. Some of the jurors
stated that they had formed opinions
from the reading of the case in the news
papers.
Attorney Church, who conducted the ex
amination of the first six of these men
before an adjournment was taken, inter
rogated them very closely .upon their
views on insanity and self-defense, show-
Ing that the defense will rely on these
two grounds in the attempt to clear the
defendant from the charge against him.
Jurors were asked if they . distinguished
between insanity that is the result of dis
ease or heredity and the insanity that is
caused by the excessive use of intoxi
cating liquors. They were also sounded
for their opinions upon self-defense, and
particularly upon the degree to which
they thought they should forbear before
taking aggressive steps In their own be
half.
The afternoon session was taken up
with the examination of jurors. The first
twelve men to be called to the jury box
were A. A. Demars, John H. Troy,
Augustin N. Bernal, L. Lemekin, Peter
Cook, William Langstaff, Theodore P.
Strong, Severin Anderson, E. E. Walcott
and Charles T. Gunn. s
Upon the third ground for challenging
the panel, regarding- the legality of the
excuses of jurymen. Judge Melvin held
that ho had acted within the law. He
then denied the challenges of the defend
ant's counsel and ordered the trial to pro
ceed.
Insanity and Self-Defense.
After argument upon the question of
the right of the Superior Judges to draw
the jury panel Judge Melvin said he
thought the proceedings had been regular,
as the law requires that where the popu
lation of the county reaches more than
100,000 the selection of the jury is taken
#>ut of the hands of the Board of Super
visors.
Upon the calling of the case Attorney
Snook challenged the legality of the jury
panel upon three groundsâ that the Board
of Supervisors and not the Superior Court
Judges should have selected the jurors;
that some of the jurors who had been
regularly drawn had not been summoned
by the Sheriff, and that a number of Jury
men had been excused from attendance
without giving legal excuses. The testi
mony of Deputy Sheriff William Holland
was introduced to sustain the contention
that some of the jurors drawn had not
been summoned. One of these jurors was
John N. Bonham. The Deputy Sheriff tes
tified that he did not summon him be
cause the summons called for a man
named John A. Bonham. He had not
been able to find three other men whose
names had been drawn. \
Jury Panel Is Challenged.
When the case was called Adams sat in
court in a chair next to that of his daugh
ter, Miss Agnes L. Adams, who had ap
peared a few minutes before the session
began. During the entire day they spoke
but few words, though sitting in quite
close proximity. Adams buried his face
in his hands most of the time and seemed
to be listening intently to the proceed
ings. Miss Adams sat upright and ap
peared to have only a passing interest In
what was going on about her. There were
no conversations between Adams and his
attorneys, who devoted all of their time
to the technical phases of the case and
the effort to secure a jury.
'Attorneys Charles E. Snook, Linwood S.
Church and N. A. McConaghy appeared
in behalf of Adams, while District Attor
ney Allen and Deputy District Attorney
Harris conducted the prosecution.

Charles G. Adams, the former Episcopa
lian clergyman, who shot and fatally in
jured Dr. John G. Jessup of Berkeley
while the victim' of the tragedy was try
ing to' pacify him in behalf of his daugh
ter, is on trial for his life. The trial of
the murder charge against him began at
10 o'clock this morning in Judge Melvin's
court.
It is supposed that Mrs. Collins was
cooking her dinner when the oil stove ex
ploded. The body was taken to the
Morgue.
About three months ago Mrs. Collins
ranted a room in the upper story of the
Mission-street building. Little is known
of her. She was in poor circumstances
and lived frugally. She associated little
with the other occupants of the house
and was regarded as somewhat oZ a
recluse.
About 7 o'clock last evening O. B.
Decker detected the odor of smoke in tha
building and traced it to Mrs. Collins*
room. He broke the door open and a
sheet of flame burst into the hallway.
With the assistance of several other
roomers the fire was soon extinguished.
The body of the unfortunate woman was
then found.
Mrs. Collins, an aged woman residing
at 952 Mission street, was burned to death
in her room last evening through the ex
plosion of a coal, oil stove. The woman
was alone at the time she met her death.
The fire was extinguished by other room
ers in the house.
President Roosevelt will sign to-morrow
the commissions of some thirty artillery
officers, who were promoted to-day as a
result of the enlistment of the artillery to
Its full strength. He will also appoint a
Targe number of second lieutenants and
detail several officers to various staff de
partments.
In determining to place a capable and
comparatively young officer at the head of
the ordnance department President Roose
velt has in mind the necessity of a
thorough reorganization of that depart
ment. During the war with Spain Presi
dent Roosevelt, then a lieutenant colonel
of the First Volunteer Cavalry, experi
enced great difficulty in getting arms and
the ordnance equipment lor his regiment.
It is his desire to put the department in
condition to meet without delay any de
mands that may be made upon it. Cap
tain Crozier is regarded by army officers
as the man to effect the needed reorgani
zation. His selection by the President is
not final, but it is understood that his
name is under consideration. He is a
splendid type of the ordnance officer, en
ergetic, careful and persistent. Should
his appointment be made he will over
slaugh twenty-nine brother officers who
rank as colonels, lieutenant colonels, ma
jors and captains.
Captain Crozier is not yet forty-five
years of age. He was born in Ohio and
was appointed as a cadet at the military
academy from Kansas, entering in 1S72.
He was graduated from the academy in
1S76 and was appointed second lieutenant
of artillery. He was transferred to the
ordnance department in 1881 and in 1890
was promoted to the grade of captain.
During the war with Spain he was ap
pointed major and inspector general of
volunteers. He is popularly known by
reason of his participation in the invention
of the Crozier-Buffington disappearing
gun carriage. In recognition of his worth
he was appointed professor of philosophy
at West Point, but declined to serve, pre
ferring ordnance work.
Brigadier General Adelbert R. Buffing
ton, chief of ordnance, will be placed on
the retired list next month and the indi
cations to-day are that he, will be suc
ceeded by an officer of the grade of cap
tainâCaptain William Crozier, now on
duty at the Sandy Hook proving grounds.

CALL, BUREAU. 1406 G STREET X
W.. WASHINGTON. Sept. 23.-Free traV
sit across the Isthmus of Panama was
assured and the cities of Colon and Pan
ama saved from an insurgent attack Sep
tember 13 as the r<~>ult of the vigorous
representations made by the American
consular officers. These representations
â¢were especially important in view of the
attempt of the insurgent commander to
receive recognition from Great Britain
France and Spain. '
Consul Malmros. the American repre
senuuve at Colon, states in his report
that he received through the Alcalde of
Colon an open letter from the insurgent
Â£?i?S an ?? r ' ,FÂ»vta* notice of a contexS
? i,^L e< i, a 5 t ? ck tm Colon, which letter he
immediately referred to the commanding
?S%L$ l K e Machia *- The Consul wa!
w?^?*?*. h^ * dentlcal notes had been
1 at the Alcaloe's office for the consu
lar officers of Great Britain, France and
fcpain. Energetic action was taken by
Malmroe immediately after he had re
ceived the insurgent notification. He
transmitted to the insurgent commander
a notification that "any interference with
the free transit of goods and persons
across the Isthmus of Panama will be a
violation of the treaty rights of the
united States, and the United States will
act accordingly."
This declaration, reinforced by the
moral effect of the presence of the gun
boat Machias at Colon and the battleship
Iowa at Panama, caused the insurgent
commander to abandon his plan for oper- '
ations against those points.
"So long as our ships remain there," the
Consul General at Panama reported to the
State Department, "there will not likelv
be any trouble."
Consul Malmros clearly defined to the
insurgent commander the point at which
American intervention would occur Xot
enly would it act in the case of the in
.terruption of free transit across the Isth
mus, but he stated that any "obstruction
of free access to the Panama Railroad
station at Colon from any of the docks of
the port or any obstruction of the main
streets of Colon to the Panama Railroad
station and any act of the insurgents'
*Â°mF*V ren dering such access dangerous
Â¦will be regarded as an interference with
the free transit referred to."
The State Department has heartilv ap
proved Malmros' vigorous stand. In his
report Malmros adds that during the
night of September 3, the day he received
the insurgent notification. 100 Government
troops arrived from Panama at Gatun
and about the same time the insurgent
forces decamped. Fifty of the 100 men at
Gatun arrived at Colon on September 4,
6 2> at the i orces at Colon amounted to
100 soldiers and thirty policemen. The
rebels forces at Gatun are variously esti
mated at between 200 and 500 men, but
? as far as the Consul can ascertain no
body has actually seen more than fifty
men. There may be some additional in
surgents within supporting distance, but
.lardly enough to swell their number to
V0 men. A general order is published <n
Â¦tanama indicating the reorganization cf
yie insurgent forces in Panama. That
foreign interests are menaced by the ope
rations of the insurgents and their danger
may lead to European intervention is in
dicated by Consul Malmros' statement
that "property belonging to American res
idents of the district of Bocas del Toro
has been Impressed by insurgents."
The State Department officials say that
if American interests have been injured
other foreign interests have undoubtedly
suffered.
Consul Malmros acted as promptlv to
secure indemnity for persons whose prop
erty was seized as he did to notify the
insurgents that his Government would not
permit the interruption of free transit.
He has directed that affidavits be pre
pared stating the names of the parties
taking the property, a full description of
property, its value and other pertinent
facts, "in order that well-supported claims
for Carnages may hereafter be presented."
In his official report of the situation
Consul General Gudger refers to the cur
rent report that an invading force from
Corinto, Nicaragua, has landed at Chame,
some twenty to thirty miles distant from
Panama. The report has not been con
firmed.
Consul Malmros, who will be officially
commended for the atitude he adopted,
has been in the consular service less than
two years, but his work has been of a
high order and the authorities are con
fident that he will be able to deal with
the situation.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
San Francisco hop dealers were asked
about the situation as described by Mr.
Dovdal. It was admitted by somu that
the estimate oÂ£ the crop of the Pacino
Coast was approximately correct, but the
crop of Great Britain was said to be
largely underestimated. E. R. Lilisnthal
said that Mr. Dovdal was correct In de
claring that the dealers were trying to
have the freight rate on hops reduced. He
had personally told the Southern Pacific
traffic officials that it- was necessary to
have the old rate of I 1 - cents restored to
encourage the hop-growers, and that un
less this were done there would be i. large
plowing up of hop acreage prior to 1902.
The hop-growers of Oregon are report
ed by Dovdal to be holding for better
prices, and dealers, realizing that, they
cannot procure hops in Oregon to fill their
orders, are trying to get them in this
State. In conclusion Dovdal says Â«.o the
hop-growers:
"Growers should not force their hops on
the market, but store them away until
they can get their prices. The buyer must
come to you sooner or later. The position
is in your hands if you only realize it."
Secretary Dovdal combats the Idea, that
there will be an abundance of hops. He
supplies estimates to show that ths Pa
cific Coast will harvest only 135,000 bale*
at the most, with a probability of only
130,000 bales, as asainst 151.000 bales last
year, and that New York State will grow
about the same as last year, say 53,000
bales. This makes for the United States
about 190,000 bales, to which must bÂ«s add
ed 5000 bales imported from foreign coun
tries, making a total to the United '.States
of IKi.OOO bales. Estimating that exports
will amount to 30,000 bales only, as ajjainst
the ordinary exports of 60.000 to SO.OQO
baled, and also estimating that the annual
requirements of the brewers in the United
States 'are 200,000 bale3, Dovdal figures
that the supply will be 35,000 bales short
of the requirements.
"When requirements only have to txj met,
he says, hops usually average 12^ cents
to 15 cents. With a shortage of 35,000
bales, what prices should be expected?
England, as he estimates, has a fairly
good crop, but not enough for he:r de
mand, and he believes that the world will
not produce enough hops in 1901 to meet
the world's needs. <-
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 23.â "W. E. Dov
dal, secretary of the State Hop-sroweiV
Association, has Issued an appeal to
growers to hold their hops until they can
obtain higher prices. He says that a few
opening sales of hops have been made at
ridiculously low prices and that there are
several causes for this. \ One Is that the
freight rate is 2 cents, as against 1%
cents last year; others are that merchants
are holding- back, -while trying to have the
old rate restored that they may sa?e the
one-half cent per pound and that dealers
have been filling- their orders with hops
groTfn in New York State on account of
the high freight rate; ihat brewers sup
pose there will be a large surplus;, thia
year, and therefore believe hops mist so
lower. - - â¢

I Lunt. 2666 Mission street.A sample of the feeling In the "big yel
low building" toward Hays is . very ap
parent Just at present. HÂ«: is certainly a
dead issue. Judging from the actions of
other officials. When President Hays firs:
arrived in this city visitors to the. railroad
building were confronted with cabinet
bust portraits Of Hays in < very office and
corner of the building. This* photos havo
all disappeared and now photos of the
late C. P. Huntlngton. handsomely
framed, are placed in their stead. N- >
President Hays returned to thla city and
made new rules and chs.nges that ha
thought were of benefit tc the Southern
Pacific. Among the changes was the dis
missal of Colonel "Jack" Wright and the
appointment of J. M. Herbert as manager
in Fillmore's place. Wrlghi:, who was su
perintendent of the Sacranento division,
did not believe in giving up his position
without a good fight, and It Is said that
he kept the wires warm asking H. E.
Huntington to intercede -v/ith Harriman
on his behalf. The Huntir.gton Influence
was not strong enough to. save Wright,
but he was told that he would not loso
anything by "taking his medicine." anÂ«i
it is now generally known that he will
soon hold a responsible position in the
"blgr yellow building."
Flllmore also fell back on H. E. Hunt
in Rton when he was removed. The liquor
men of this city worked tte wires trying
to get Harriman to revoke the order re
moving the saloons on tlie ferry-boats,
and they succeeded in getting an exten
sion, of time. All these wirs pullings wers
distasteful to President Hays. He packed
his things, went to New Ycrk and wanted
to know if he was president or not. Ilar
riman's answer was not satisfactory to
Hays and the railroad president promptly
handed in his resignation.
Charles M. Hays was appointed to the
responsible position he now wishes to give
up by the Speyer interests. That the con
trol of the road passed into the hands of
Harrlman in a few weeks :.s well known.
The moment that Harriman took posses
sion President Hays was oie of the first
sent for to appear before Harriman and
give an account of his stewardship. Hs
made quite an impression with Harriman
and was told to "go way tack" and hold
his position. He was led to infer that his
word was law and that he would be sus
tained in all his orders.
The reason why President Charles M.
Hays of the Southern Pacific handed In
his resignation has at last leaked out and
forms the chief topic of conversation
among railroad men. It is now generally
known that Hays' resignation was har
ried by the Huntlngton cllq le of this city,
which could not tolerate hhi too rapid re
forms and lightning changes In the per
sonnel of the staff.

Since Jast Saturday the politicians <rfio

gossip is to the effect, that Auditor Asa
R. Wells is t 'rowing In favor as a candi

Immediately ov the report that Johi& C.
Kirkpatrick, Harbor Commissioner and
manager of the Palace Hotel, would not
permit his name, to 'go before the conven
tion. It is true t-i'iat Mr. Kirkpatrick has
made up his mind to give a negative an
ewer to his supporters who have, been ad
vising him to enter the race for the nom
ination. To-day he will speak frankly to
his supporters and submit his reasons for
the negative, answer*
Discussing the topic last evening- Mr.
Kirkpatrick frankly said:
"When the suggestion was first made to
xne that my candidacy would be accept
able to many delegates in the convention
and to other citizens and that my: nom
ination would reconcile many of the dif
ferences in the party I was extremely
gratified. At thai time I promised to con
sider the subject, remarking that my first
obligation was to the people with whom
I have long been associated and whose
business interests . I am bound by every
sense of loyalty to guard. I informed my
friends that I would give them a definite
reply by Tuesday of this week, and to
morrow I wUl state to them my reasons
ior declining to enter the race.
Duties of Office Require Time.
"I do not say It in a. spirit of boasting,
bat speak of it as an Incident, that many
Democrats have said to me that they
would gladly support me at the polls pro
vided 1 received the nomination of the
Republican convention. Expressions of
this kind are certainly gratifying in view
of the fact that I am not an old resident
of San Francisco and have not sought
political advancement.
'â¢Going over riie ground carefully I reach
the conclusion that the duties of the of
fice of i Mayor demand more time and
work than I could give without sacrificing
business affairs which I am charged to
protect. I have studied the subject suf
ficiently to ascertain that I would bÂ©
obliged to- resign the position of Harbor
CommiEsioi.er if I were elected Mayor of
Ean Francfcsco. I was not an applicant
for the office of Harbor Commissioner.
The appointment came to me unsought,
yet I appreciate It and have in mind im
portant work In connection with harbor
management â¢which 1 expect to assist in
accomplishing, i
"I also take Into consideration the fact
that men who e^nploy me to look after
business affairs ot considerable magnitude
simply go zrxay from Uie city and
State, leaving questions, big and little, to
be passed upon or settled by me alone. I
have 'reached the conclusion therefore
that I could not if ejected Mayor give to
the office the time required for faithful
and efficient performance of the public
dttty.
"It is my custom to speak with direct
frankness in dealing with men, and I
shall say to my friends who have honored
me with assurances of political support
that I cannot, in view of my business em
ployments and in Justice to my, employers
&nd myself, accept additional public re
sponsibility. I shrill request that my
name be not presented to the convention
as a candidate for office."
Could Win Nomination.
It is the general impression among well
informed observers' of the local contest
that Mr. Kirkpatrick could win the Re
publican nomination and be elected May
or if he desired to enter the race. It is
not settled by any means that Auditor
Wells will carry off the first prize in the
convention, but his stock has gone up
several points since It transpired that.
Mr. Kirkpatrick would not enter the race.

This evening Father Shahan will lecture
on the "Crusades" at Metropolitan Tem
ple, and General James F. Smith will pre
side and deliver a short address.
The distinguished divine held the inter
est of a large, audience for two hours, in
which he described the sweeping away of
the temples of paganism and the estab
lishment of the edifices of Christianity.
He detailed the. expansion of the email
places of Christian worship into the mag
nificent cathedrals of the Catholic church,
and explained the different kinds of archi
tecture in the past centuries. Father
Shahan minutely described ' the artistic
features of the Romanesque and Gothic
styles of building, and how the cathedrals
became the center of activity. â¢ To indi
vidual help the cathedrals owed their ex
istence, the people adding to the generous
gifts of Kings and Emperors. â¢ Â¦
Father Shahan paid a tribute to the
workmen who erected the sacred edifices
and said that the erection of them stimu
lated all the arts.
"Building of the Cathedrals of Europe"
was the subject of the lecture delivered
last evening by the Rev. Father Shahan
at Metropolitan Temple under the aus
pices of the Catholic Truth Society.
To-Night He Will Speak on "Cru
sades," and General James F.
Smith Will Preside.
FATHER SHAHAN LECTURES
ON CATHEDRAL BUILDING
mittee of the city and county of San Francisco
hereby expresses its sincere sorrow for the un
timely death of the President, and extends its
sympathy to the bereaved widow. Â¦
Bishop Whipple has been succeeded by
the Right Rev. Samuel Cook Edsall, who
has lately been translated from the Dio
cese of North Dakota to become Coadju
tor Bishop of Minnesota.
He has converted most of the Indians
and turned them from the warpath to the
avocations of peace. His, friends in Eng
land are numerous. In the Anglican
church he Â¦was considered a most accom
plished and persuasive preacher.
Among his own people Bishop Whipple
was regarded with superlative venera
tion. An Intimate friend of Archbishop
Ireland, the two prelates were often
united In measures looking to the public
good.
In Minnesota the loss of Bishop Whip
ple will be felt among all classes of peo
ple, but in his own church, deprived of
his counsel and example, the passing- of
one so greatly loved and honored will
cast a deep gloom.
He was one of the original members
of the Peabody fund, and during the war
of the rebellion a member of the Sani
tary Commission. In K70 he was offered
the bishopric of the Sandwich Islands,
but declined. In 1S88 he preached the
opening sermon in Westminster Abbey
before the Pan-Anglican Synod. He has
built a handsome cathedral In Farlbault,
besides schools for both sexes. ' Hospitals
have been erected in several of the-lead
ing cities of the diocese, and in. conse
quence of his active labors there is
scarcely a hamlet that has no church
and rector of his denomination.
of the tribes, and in 1876 was a member
of the commission which concluded a
treaty with the Sioux and opened the
Black Hills to settlement. Among the
red men he was known as Straight
Tongue; the whites have known him as
"the apostle to the Indians."
MANY prominent delegates to the
Episcopal convention, which
will be held at Trinity Church
in this city next month, have
left the East and are now jour
neying westward. In this gathering of
prelates, ministers and laymen will be
those most high in the affairs of the
church, but the convention will seem in
complete without the familiar and stately
figure of the late Right Rev. Henry Ben
jamin Whipple, Bishop of Minnesota.
The death of Bishop Whipple is regret
ted by a wide circle of men in and out
of the church. A man of extraordinary
attainments and engaging manners, he
was consecrated Bishop when Min
nesota was regarded as an out
post of civilization. The cities of St.
Paul and Minneapolis existed only as
frontier villages and the fertile fields as
reservations of savage Indians.
Consecrated in. 1S59, before a mile of
railroad was built in that State, the
BlEhop has had a large share in its de
velopment. In the early days of his epis
copate his greatest efforts were expended
in the conversion of the Indians. In 2S62
the Sioux rose in insurrection against the
whites and the northern frontier of the
State was crimson In flame and blcod.
A war of extermination was waged
against the Sioux Indians by Government
troops. Bishop Whipple raised his pow
erful voice- in behalf of the savages and
journeyed to Washington to appeal to
President Lincoln on behalf of the sav
ages. His intercession was successful,
and largely through his efforts the meth
ods employed in dealing with the Indians
were changed for the better.
In 1865 Bishop Whipple was appointed
commissioner to report on the condition
practically agreed upon, but there will be
another session of the committee Thurs
day afternoon to revise the document and
see if Instructions touching amendments
have been properly carried out. The plat
form is brief. The statement was made
last evening by the chairman that the
strike agitation would not be mentioned
in the resolutions reported by the com
mittee.
Democratic Local Convention.
The Democratic convention for the
nomination of candidates for municipal
offices will be held September 30. 1901.
This was decided upon at the meeting of
the Democratic County Committee held
at Native Sons' Hall last night. The res
olution setting the date was presented by
T. W. Shanahan and was adopted with
out discussion. â¢
The selection of the hall in which the
nominations will be made was left to Sec
retary Thomas Hickey. Odd Fellows*
Hall will probably be chosen.
W. T. Hess presented the following res
olution denouncing the assassination of
William McKlnley and conveying the
sympathy of the members of the com
mittee to Mrs. McKinley:
Whereas, Through the dastardly act of a
cowardly assassin our beloved President, Wil
liam McKtnley, has been removed from this
earthly sphere;
Whereas, We fully appreciate his sterling
character and good qualities as a public officer;
Resolved, That the Democratic County Com-

. The track at Oakland yesterday was in
no condition for. the harness . horses, and
the 2:14 trot was postponed until this aft
ernoon, t The usual crowd crossed the bay
and six running events were decided, first
choices In the' betting capturing three. J.
Ransch rode in excellent form, finishing
first on Quadra, Sonic and Galanthua.
At . the very commencement the sharp
shooters made a botch of target practice,
getting aboard First Shot at. 3 to 2 and
seeing Fine Shot win almost easily at 6 to
1. Burllngame had the mount on the lat
ter, and shaking off the mud at the start
was never caught. Ruiz on the favorite
did. beat. Cousin Carrie for the place.
As they looked pretty evenly matched
the books laid 6 to 5 and take your pick
in the betting on the five-furlong scram
ble for two-year-olds. . Quadra took to the
going like a hobo to the brakebeam, win
ning all the way. It was quite as easy for
Botany to . down Arthur Ray for place
honors.
Bookmaker Caesar Young's filly Eonlo
went to the post a 1 to 3 chance for the
third number, a six-furlong dash. Ransch
rated along in third position with her to
the stretch before making his move.
Then mowing Huachuca and Saul of Tar
sus down at leisure the favorite disposed
of the first named colt by less than a
length. McDermott on Mike Strauss made
sad work of It.
Owing to the condition of the track the
four-cornered race between Meehanus,
Rey Dare, Sir Hampton and Sir Dougal
was declared off, and a six-furlong affair
Eubstituted. Flamero fell into a very
cheap set, and at odds of 3 to 6 won as he
pleased. Estado took second place from
Corrlente. ,
Ransch astride Galanthus clearly outfln
ished Hoar on the even money favorite
Llzzella for the mile selling run. At the
start Ransch lost no time in getting to
the front and making better use of his
mount in the sail home got the decision
by a long head. Hoar, who rode Llzzella,
gave promise of being a very clever rider,
but his head outgrew all of his old head
coverings. This has interfered with his
progress. Mike Rice ran a fair third.
The winner was 2 to 1 in the betting.
Not many days ago Sugden was backed
off the boards by the shrewd ones and
ran away with his rider. Yesterday in the
speculating on the closing chapter he was
almost overlooked In tne scramble to get
the checks down on Duckoy. The latter
never looked a contender, and under Ike
Tullett's good handling Sugden got up in
time to beat Clarando a head on the
wire. Nullah ran third.

The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that documents may be filed in public
offices at any time on days not forbidden
by law, regardless of the hours regularly
set apart for the transaction of official
business.
The subject was intrduced by a man
named Stark from Santa Clara County,
who was Involved In legal difficulties by
reason of failure to file certain papers on
a specified day. He arrived at the Coun
ty Clerk's office after closing time, and
after hunting up a deputy delivered the
documents to him. The deputy did not,
however, make the necessary entries until
the following morning, and J hence the
court held that the papers were not filed
on the day in question.
It was stated by the court in closing
that had the deputy followed the usual
course of procedure the transaction would
have been perfectly legitimate, as regular
hours do not necessarily constitute a legal
day in public offices.
