WITH MAIN OFFICE IN NEW YORK

Backed by the Influence of H. E. Huntihgton, Will Succeed the

EB speculation as to the successor
jl cf tie late John J. Valentine as
II president of "Wells, Fargo & Co.
*^ was ended yesterday wltli tliÂ© au
thoritative announcement that at
the taeetlng of thÂ« directors, to be held
to-day or to-morrow. Second Vice Presi
dent Dudley Evans of New York would
be chosen the future head of the great
express conoern.
Another and equally Important an
sounceznent was also made that within a
' few months the head offices of the com
pany would be removed to Xew York at
V 2Q request of Evans, who, although he
'expresses himself as well pleased with
the climate of California, is not particu
larly desirous of severing frlendshipa_at
the East in order to accept the presi
dency cf too company and make San
Francisco his future home. As the de
sires of the Incoming president will be
respected by the directors, all of whom
hold Evans In high esteem, it is more
t^n likely that his wish in this regard
will be granted.
The news of Uudley Evans' selection
to be the next president of the company
will be a surprise to the hundreds of em
ployes who had been quietly informed
that the choice of the honor lay between
Colonel George E. Gray and Homer S.
King. The name of Evans was men
tioned, but it was believed that he would
be promoted to be first vice president
only. The recent arrival of Evans from
New Tork and the active part he has
since taken in Wells, Fargo & Co.'s af
fairs caused some comment among those
â who predicted the selection to the presi
dency of either Gray or King. It was
sincerely hoped by the employes In line
for promotion that one or the other of
the gentlemen named would capture the
honor, for that meant advancements all
along the line. While the promotion of
Evans to the presidency necessarily
means promotion for many, these will not
now be so numerous. "What effect the
removal of the main offices of the com
pany to New Tork â will have no one seems
able to say with any degree of certainly.
Evans Backed by Huntington.
Second Vice President Evans came to
this city with the indorsement of H. E.
Huntlngton and John J. McCook for the
presidency. "While many of the directors
thought that the honor should go to Colo
nel Gray, whose services as first vice
president had given eminent satisfaction
to all concerned, the Huntlngton influence
items to have been strong enough to con
vir.ee the majority of the board that
Evans was the man for the place. It
leaked out yesterday that Huntington had
written personal letters t.o several of his
fellow directors requesting them to sup
port Evans for the honor. Neither Hunt
ington nor McCook will be present at the
meeting of the board, but it is said their
proxies have been sent on and that they
will be voted in Evans' interest. There
will be six directors at the meeting. They
are Colonel George E. Gray, Homer S.
King, Captain John Bermingham. Captain
Oliver Eldrldg-e~An*lrew~Christeson and
Dudley Evans. A successor to Valentine
on the board of directors must be selected
before the election for president Is en
tered upon. The name of the man slated
for director has not yet been made pub
lic.
Second Vice President Evans left the
city on a business trip a few days ago
and returned Saturday night. Yesterday
morning he breakfasted with Solomon D.
Brastow, superintendent of the Western
<MviÂ£ion of Wells, Fargo & Co., and Ra
phael Welll. The gentlemen were togeth
er for more than an hour and later in the
day Evar.s was in consultation with offi
cials of the company. In view of the fact
that the board of directors Is about to
meet, these consultations on the eve of
the gathering were regarded as being
most significant.

WELL-KNOWN MANAGER OF THE NEW YORK BRANCH OF WELLS,
FARGO & CO.. â WHO WILL SUCCEED THE LATE JOHN J. VALEN
TINE AS PRESIDENT OF THAT CORPORATION.
That the confidence of the directors In
Evans will not be misplaced by promot
ing him to the responsible position of
president of the company is evidenced by
his sterling qualities as man and official,
so often displayed In his management of
the New York office. Colonel Evans'
career has been one of extreme activity
and brilliant achievements. He was born
near Morgantown, Monongahela County,
Va.. now "West Virginia, January 27, 1S3S.
He is descended from an old Welsh fam
ily, his great-great-grandfather having
been one of three brothers who settled
in Philadelphia in 1720. His forbears took
an active part in the colonial wars and in
the war of the Revolution. His grand
father, Dudley Evans, was a colonel un
der General Harrison in the war of 1812,
and while In command of a regiment of
Virginia militia was stationed at Fort
Meigs.
The youthful days of Evans were spent
on the farm. At the age of 15 he attend
ed the Monongahela" Academy, where he
was prepared for college. He subsequent
ly entered the junior class at Washington
College. Pennsylvania, and graduated in
1859. A. few months later he went to
Louisiana, where he resided at the out
break of the Rebellion. Having an inclina
tion for more stirring action he returned
to Virginia, and on his arrival at Beverly
he fell in with the Confederate troops in
camp near that place ahd remained there
until the battle of Rich Mountain. He
subsequently Joined the Confederate army
at Manassas, under the command of Gen
erals Beauregard and Johnston. After the
battle of Seven Pines he was commis
sioned a captain in the Virginia State
troops, which were subsequently turned
over to the Confederate army.
Brilliant Record as Soldier.
In the fall of 1862 he was taken prisoner

and sent to Camp Chase, Ohio, and then
transferred to Vlcksburg, where he was
subsequently exchanged. Military honors
now crowded upon him. In the spring of
1863 he was elected a lieutenant colonel
in the Confederate cavalry and in that
capacity took part in all the battles in
the valley of Virginia in 1863-61. His bril
liant record as a soldier, together with his
popularity as a man and comrade In
I arms, prompted the soldiers to elect him
to the Legislature of Virginia, and the
winter of 1804-65 he spent at Richmond.
At the close of the war he came to Cali
fornia with the Intention of practicing
law, but on account of his political ante
cedents he was debarred by statutory en
actment. He thereupon sought and ob
tained an appointment with Wells, Fargo
â¢ & Co. and was ordered to Victoria, B. C,
where he remained till 1871, when he was
appointed agent at Portland, Or.
While serving at Portland Colonel
Evans acted as supervising agent for
Oregon and Washington Territory. Later
he was made superintendent of the north
western division. In 1888 he was trans
ferred to Omaha, Nebr., and in the same
year he was made general superintendent
of the central department. On December
1, 1891, he was sent to New York to take
-charge of the Atlantic department, and
since that date he has continued as man
ager. On August 11, 1892, he was elected
one of the board of directors and made
second vice president of the company,
which position he filled with signal suc
cess ever since.
Personally, Colonel Evans Is an affable
gentleman. His popularity among his as
sociates is unbounded, and the news of
his forthcoming elevation to the presi
dency of the concern with which he has
so long been identified will be received
with pleasure by all with whom he has
been in any way associated.

TWO NATIONS
WISH TO END
Pauncefote and Hay to
Adjust Remaining
Differences.
Will Afterward Submit Their
Agreement to a High -
Commission.
Hope by This Means to End Long
standing Quarrel Over the Fron
tiers of Canada and the
United States.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â It is expected
that efforts will be renewed before long
for the settlement of the numerous con
troversies which have long' existed be
tween the United States and Great Brit
ain growing out of relations along the
Canadian border, the Atlantic fisheries,
warships on the great lakes, the Alaskan
boundary and other questions. Hereto
fore the negotiations .designed to bring
about settlements have not proved ef-
fective, largely because of the cumber
some machinery of the proceedings, and
this has led to a belief that much more
could be accomplished by direct negotia
tions between Secretary Hay and Lord
Pauncefote on the main points and the
subsequent assembling, of a commission
representing the United States, Great
Britain and Canada to give form to the
basis of agreement rendered.
â¢ The British authorities have expected
for some , time that .when the isthmian
canal treaty was once disposed of there
would be a renewal of the efforts to ad
just the Alaskan boundary and other
pending questions, the canal treaty being
regarded as one of many pending issues.
Now that the British Government has
yielded the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and
other points in the Isthmian negotiations
it desires to take up some of the other
questions In which it has important inter
ests involved. Lord Pauncefote desires
to clear up all pending differences and
have "a clean slate" before his present
term as Embassador comes to a close.
Only One Issue Remains Unsolved.
When Lord Pauncefote came to Wash
ington there were four great issues be
tween the two Governments. The flrs^ of
these was the Bering Sea controversy,
which had reached an acute stage. Diplo
macy disposed of this issue. The second
was over Venezuela, which, like the seal
question, at one time threatened war. But
the efforts of diplomacy were again suc
cessful in averting trouble and bringing
about a settlement. The third important
issue waa the isthmian canal, which has
been satisfactorily disposed of by the re
cent Hay-Pauncefote treaty.
This leaves only one issue standing out
against "a clean slate," namely, the
border controversies, both as to Canada
and Alaska. The British officials link
these various boundary controversies to
gether, as they are more or less connect
ed. At present a modus vivendi exists as
to the Alaskan boundary, chiefly for the
purpose of avoiding a clash along the bor
der and holding each side in check until
a final boundary is determined upon. It
seems to be conceded on both sides that
the modus vivendi cannot be â¢ carried on
Indefinitely ! and that sooner or later the
main question of establishing a permanent
boundary must be settled. Lord Lans
downe's desire to take . up the question
was expressed clearly in his note to Secre
tary Hay last spring, when the British
Government declined to accept the Senate
amendment to the first Hay-Pauncefote
treaty.
Lord Lansdowne's Attitude.
Recently Lord Lansdowne again has ex
pressed in speeches the need of taking up
the Alaskan boundary question. These
declarations by the head of the British
foreign service, together with the well
known wish of Lord Pauncefote to clear
away all pending differences between the
two countries, doubtless will lead to the
formal exchanges necessary to an adjust
ment.
Just what steps will be adopted are not
disclosed, but It seems likely that direct
negotiations and the subsequent assem
bling of a commision will commend itself
to the parties concerned as .the most feas
ible procedure.
The border, issues outside of that re
lating to Alaska are those which have
long existed and have created more or
less friction. The Joint High Commission
which assembled some time ago practical
ly disposed of these, lesser Issues, but the
deadlock on Alaska prevented a treaty cov
ering these and other points of agreement.
With the disposal of the Alaskan bound
ary, therefore, it is' felt that the way
would be â¢ clear to dispose of the other
controversies. â¢."â¢.'. , â  â¢
The reciprocity question, which is
among; those formerly considered, is not
likely to be taken up in this connection,
as Canada desires to make it the subject
of separate negotiation. The Atlantic fish
eries question also may be the subject of
separate negotiation*.

HELENA, Mont., Dec. 29.â The
trust power of the United States
has never before met such deter
mined and formidable political
opposition as that which will ma
terialize In this city to-morrow in the con
vening of the Governors of at least four
of the Northwestern States, who are
called together by Governor S. R. Van
Sant of Minnesota to devis^ ways and
means to prevent the control of three
great transcontinental railroads â the Bur
lington, the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northernâ passing into the hands
of the recently organized Northern Secu
rities Company of New York.
In spite of the recent statement of J. J.'
Hill, calculated to allay the fears of the
people of .the Northwest and persuade
them that the development of this vast
territory - is not threatened by the pro
posed merger of these lines', all of the
public men of the various States most
vitally interested look with ' Increasing
concern upon the formation and plans of
this gigantic combination of money Inter
ests for the control of traffic interests
from the Mississippi to Puget Sound.
Array of Legal Talent.
Political economists and statesmen
everywhere will watch with interest the
progress of the battle royal between capi
tal and commonwealths. No one knows
just how long this conference will last,
what methods it will pursue nor how any
action decided upon will be jointly prose
cuted. The various Governors will come
accompanied by the Attorney Generals of
their various States, and that such an ar
ray of legal talent is gathered for the one
purpose proves significant and important
of itself.

PARIS, Dec. 29.â Mrs. J. A. Fithian of

with apoplexy Christmas night Just as
she was retiring. She remained uncon

Seamans Pails to Rally.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 29.â The condi

night. | He fails to respond to the medi
cines given him.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The hour of the conference will be at 3
o'clock to-morrow afternoon. The Ses
sions probably will be secret, at least un
til some definite course of action is agreed
upon or the Governors decide that they
desire to take joint action at all.
This afternoon Governor Toole refused
to make any statement as to his view3 of
the forthcoming conference or its proba
ble procedure. He declared that Governor
Van Sant was the inspiring genius of the
â¢ movement and in his hands all arrange
ments had been left.
Montana- Laws Forbid Merger.
Governor Toole and Attorney General
Donovan 'of this State have spent Ions
hours in conference since the question of
the railroad merger has come up, and
have decided beyond a doubt that the
Montana statutes forbid the existence and
operation of such a corporation within the
borders of the State.
It Is firmly believed here that the result
of the conference â¢will be an appeal to the
United States Supreme Court for a perpet
ual injunction restraining the Northern
Securities Company from assuming con
trol of or acquiring any interest In the
three railroad companies.
A late dispatch from St. Paul to-night
says that Governor White of North Da
kota- refuses at the last moment to take
part in the conference, although last
month he assured Governor Van Sant of
his hearty co-operation. The powerful In
fluence of J. J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern, is seen in this, and It 13 regard

EUROPE WILL FOLLOW
THE LEAD OF GERMANY
Claims Against South American Republics to
Be Pressed in Accordance With Prece
dent Established in Venezuelan Affair
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W.. WASHINGTON, Dec 29.â
Following a forcible collection by
Germany of claims held by her
subjects against Venezuela,
i ranee, Great Britain and perhaps other
countries probably will take similar ac
tion. Even war between Germany and
Venezuela is not considered, improbable.
\ precedent of the greatest importance
has been already established in the Ger
man-Venezuelan dispute and it will serve
as a basis for European collections of
claims in other countries of Central and
South America.
Intangible as the Monroe doctrine had
been before German representations had
developed the attitude of the United
States, there was no indisposition on the
part of the powers to go further than dip
lomatic representations, or even the,
severance of diplomatic relations, to ob
tain from American republics compensa
tion for injuries suffered by the persons
and property of their subjects. The oc
cupation of the Nicaraguan port of Cor
into by British marines and the action pf
Italy in compelling Colombia to satisfy
the "award of the President of the United
States in the matter of the Cerruti claims
have been referred to as precedents for
German procedure.
Stretching the Monroe Doctrine.
These incidents are not on a par with
the proposed action of Germany. The
seizure of Corinto grew out of indignities
suffered by the British Vice Consul at
Bluefieids and some twenty other British
subjects, residing in the Mosquito reser
vation, and the affairs in that reservation
were at the time a matter of negotiation
between the United States and Great Brit
ain, as well as between Nicaragua and
Great Britain.
The Italian demonstration in Colombian
waters was to obtain the payment of the
award of President Cleveland.
The Vnlted States has had no connection
whatever with the German claims. They
have developed as a result of injuries and
damages suffered by the persons and
property of German subjects and by the
default of Venezuela of its Interest on a
railroad loan granted her by German capi
talists.
Other nations have similar claims
against Venezuela and the'- and Germany
as well hold claims against other Central
and South American countries. So the in
tended action of Germany is of the high
est importance to the nations of the Xew
and Old World.
Other Nations Intend to Act.
Secretary Hay has had ample evidence
cf this fact. All of the representatives of
the great nations have made inquiries of
the Secretary as to the nurposes of the
Kaiser and of the policy of the United
States and the natural inference is that
their governments contemplate pursuing a
?olicy identical with tnat of Germany.
France holds heavy claims against Ven
ezuela. Great Britain also has large
claims. One of the questions over which
the authorities are pondering is: ''Will
France and Great Britain, immediately
after Germany obtains the money Ven
ezuela owes her subjects, inform the
Caracas Government that they want their
claims paid and that they will use force
if the money be not immediately forth
coming?"
Fortunately for the g'ood relations which
exist between the United States and Ger
many, the latter Government has made no
concealment of its plans. In view of Ger
many's purpose not to acquire Venezuelan
territory, it is said thnt the United States,
by virtue of its own declaration, can have
OHIO FACTIONAL
FIGHT SPREADING
Involves All Elements
of the Republican
Party.
CINCINNATI. Dec. 29.â The contest at
Columbus this week between the follow
ers cf Senator Foraker and Senator Han
na over the organization of the Legisla
ture has extended to factional' circles
elsewhere in the State. While the mem
bers of the Legislature and candidates
are fighting in Columbus, the principals
are kept Lusy at long-distance telephones
â notablv Senator Foraker and George B.
Cox, in Cincinnati; Senator Hanna, in
"Washington; Congressman Dick, chair
man of the State executive committee,
and other Republican leaders.
Senator Fcraker is being visited here by
many leaders and members of the Legis
ture. To-day he made the following state
ment:
â¢Tha story published from New York
that 1 spoke to the President in a derog
atory manner of Senator Hanna and that
thu President communicated the same to
Senator Hanna. and told him to be on his
guard lest he have trouble to maintain
Bis leadership in Ohio uolitics, is an un
qualified falsehood from beginning to end.
I never had any such talk with the Presi
dent, and it is not creditable to him to
suppose that he would have told it to
Senator Hanna if I had. This story is but
a s;ample of many others appearing in
the newspapers and being peddled about
from mouth to mouth lor mischievous
purposes." Â»
kftoet of the Republican members this
year are serving their ftrst term, and, ac
cording to precedent, they are expected
to be members of the next Legislature
which trin select Senator Hanr.a's suc
cessor two years hence. While there is
DO opposition to the re-election at Sena
tor Foraker two weeks hence, it is as
serted that there Is an organized move
ment to defeat Senator Hanna In 1904.
As the presiding officers in tho appoint
ment of the committees and other func
tions have great influence the friends of
both Senators are socking to control those
positions as well as all other offices, in
cluding the clerkship?, sergeant at arms,
etc.
The Hanna men aclmit that there is "a
conspiracy to retire Hanna." In former
years there Were contents between the
Sherman and the Foraker factions and
later between the McKInlcy and the For
aker factions, but none of the former
factional fights approached the present
contest in general interest. There will be
separate Foraker and Hanna tickets, sub
ject to the Senate ami House caucuses of
the Republican member?, at 4 o'clock next
Saturday afternoon. Charles L. Kurtz,
formerly secretary to Senator Foraker as
Governor and later chairman of the State
committee, leads the anti-Hanna forces,
and John P. Malloy, the present secretary
of the State committee and State Oil In
spector under Governor Nash, leads the
Hanna forces. Both sides claim "a sure
thing" and these claims and counter
claims are expected to continue during
the week.
The Democratic minority presents a
scene of harmony. Colonel James Kil
bourne, recently the Democratic candi
date for Governor, yesterday notified the
members from his county not to present
his name to the Democratic joint caucus
for their nomination for United States
Senator. This leaves Charles W. Baker
of Cincinnati without opposition for the
Democratic Senatorial nomination.

ItEFTTBIrlCS EAGER FOB, WAR
Little Hope of Peace Between Argen
tina and Chile.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â As a result
of the withdrawal by Argentina of her
assent to the protocol signed by her Min
ister to Chile war between the two South
American republics is considered inevit- 1
able. Senor Infanta, the Chilean Charge
d' Affaires, received a dispatch to-day
from his Government announcing that
there had been no formal withdrawal by
Argentina from the protocol. The Ar
gentine Minister had verbally requested
that hei be permitted to withdraw his sig
nature.' Chile has apparently not given
her consent to this request, but whether
she does or not Argentina will undoubt
edly refuse to observe the provisions of
the protocol. While anxious for peace it
is said Chile feels that she has sroneas
lar as her honor permits, and it is hoped
that the good sense of the Argentine peo
fcle will cause them to respect the agree
ment which their Government accepted.
Argentina has made no communication
to Minister Garcia Merou respecting her
action in refusing- to give ratification to
the protocol signed by her representa
tive. The situation in Argentina is lik
ened to that which existed in the United
States before the war with Spain, when
the President was. forced to obey the war
sentiment of the people. Argentina feels
that some day she will have war with
Chile and she desires to have it now,
when she is strong and feels that she
will be able to conquer her foe.

MURDER MYSTERY
SLOWLY CLEARS
Salt Lake Police Find
Pistol Where Hay
Was Slain.
SALT LAKE, Dec. 29.^-With the finding
of a 38-caliber revolver not far from the
scene of the crime, the police of this city
hstve in their possession what is believed
to be the last element necessary to clear
up the mystery of James R. Hay's mur
der on the night of December 16. The
Weapon was found burled in the mud near
the coiner of Thirteenth Southland State
streets and has been traced by 'the police
to the second-hand store where it. was
bought a short time before the murder
by a man answering the description of
Peter Mortensen, the contractor, who is
being held on the charge of having com
mitted the crime.
To-day the owner of the second-hand
store was taken to the County Jail for
the purpose of Identifying the man to
whom he sold the pistol. Out of a dozen
prisoners who were lined up he indicated
Mortensen, but said that he would not
care to swear positively to that effect, it
being fully three weeks since the sale
was made. I
Hay had been missing for two days be
fore his body was found buried in a
trench in a suburb of this city, and Jt
was reported that he had absconded with
$3800 in gold which was alleged to have
been paid to him as secretary of the Pa
cific Lumber Company by Peter Morten
sen, a contractor. Telegrams were sent
to the police of various cities asking them
to watch for Hay. The finding of the
body with a bullet in the brain created a
sensation in this city. Hay being a prom
inent and well known young man. The
whole affair was surrounded with mya
tery, but suspicion finally centered about
Mortensen, the body being found not far
from his residence, and he was placed un
der arrest.
Nothing has ever been found of the
missing 53800.

FIENDISH CRIMES
Visit Awful Vengeance
Upon Natives Who
Aid Americans.
WASHINGTON, Dec, 29.â Many Filipi
nos who accept service under American
rule are visited with awful vengeance by
their fellow countrymen. The' records of
a case have been received at the War De
partment in which three native* policemen,
who had been sent from Laoag to San
Nicholas, Ilocos Norte, for duty at the
latter point, were seized and bound by-an
armed band of Filipino outlaws, taken be
fore a priest to be confessed and then
flung alive into a well, after having been
hacked with bolo?. Their assailants then
iilled up the well with loose earth.
One of the band, Wenceslao Rosales,
who was brought to trial, was sentenced
to be hanged. Another native policeman
met his death at the hands of an outlaw
band rn the Barrio of Sati Antonia, La
Guna i>rovincc.
The outlaws were lying in ambush
a waitings the passing of a patrol of three
'policemen, and upon their approach the
waiting Filipinos sprang out and^apturett
one of the three. A few days later his
body was found in -a neighboring river,
weighted with heavy rocks and showing
wounds through his heart and in his neck.
Two of the members of the outlaw band,
â who v/ere captured, were sentenced by a
military commission to be hangeij.
Two Filipinos who took part in the mur
der of an unknown native accused of be
ing an American spy, beheading the body
and burying ft in the city of Manila, were
sentenced to be hanged.
Another outlaw band seized a native
man and woman -for no apparent*motive
and killed them by striking them with
clubs on the back of their necks. Mariano
Zalcs. 0, native member of the bandj when
brought to trial gave the following ex
planation: .
"They were relatives of mlne^ â an uncle
and an auntâ and I had to do It to save my
life."
The military commission which tried him
found him guilty of murder, but the sen
tence was confinement at hard labor for
twenty years. -'â â¢';

CHAFFEE IN HARMONY

of the Philippines Is Almost Complete

fl\\/\\ .^ ee> when questioned to-day
II W \| concerning the alleged friction
A V 1L between the civil and military
1 authorities in the Philippines,
declared ,that perfect harmony pre
vailed.. General ChafTee said that the
Dfily occasion when thefe had been any
thing approaching friction was in the
matter of habeas corpus proceedings in
the case of Oakley Brooks, and that on
this occasion a solution of the difficulty
satisfactory to both authorities had beeh
found. General Chaffee said that he and
the member's of the commission had at
times , differed in their views, Â£ but that
these differences were of purely personal
opinion. His relations with Governor
Taf t and Acting Governor Wright dnd
the other Conimissiohe'rs were,' officially
and socially, extremely pleasant and he
believed the published statement of fric
tion between the civil . and military ajir
thfcrities here must hafe resulted from. a
misunderstanding of the facts. â 
General Chaffee further explained that
every time the slightest f rldtion had
arisen in â¢' the province between the two
authorities he had invariably ordered the
military to surrender to. the civilanthori
ties. General Chaffee concluded by say
ing he thought the prospect of subduing
the insurrection in all places to be prom
ising.,
Wright Confirms Chaffee.
When Acting Governor Wright was
questioned in this same matter, he said:
"Where men of sense are at the head
eft affairs there is not likely to be much
cause ft>r alarm or friction." ' .
Governor Wright has great admiration
for General Chaffee, whom he considers
to be a man of sound common sense. He
said that although he and General Chaf
fee frequently differed radically upon va
rious subjects still the most amicable re
lations were maintained under all circum

FAVORS POLICY
OF EXPANSION
Dr. Vosberg Says Ger
many Needs Colonial
Territory.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â The State
Department has received from United
States Consular Agent Harris at Elben
etock an Interesting report on the sub
ject of German colonial enterprises. Con
sul Harri3 quotes from a speech deliv
ered by Dr. Vosberg-Rekow, Director of
the German Bureau for the Preparation
of Commercial Treaties, before tha mer
chants of Leipzig aa follows:
It is evident that we can never give up
our -present policy relative to foreign affairs
or the strenui us efforts being made to t>ecoma
a great sea power. We must engage in colon-'
lal politics on a large scale. We must strive
to expand our spheres of interest and to instill
in our people the consciousness of the neces
sity oC an aggressive policy. It 13 only by
the annexation of territory beyond the States,
the development of our coionie3 ami' tho organ
ization of immigration to the same, that we
may ever hope to be in a position to supply,
those natural products which we are not able
to I produce within the borders of the home
country.
; Harris points out that while the terri
tory comprised in all of. the German col
onies abroad amounts to 2,557,000 square
miles, with a white population- oJ -6008
"(only a little more than half being Ger
man); not a. single one of these colonies
is self-supporting. The total income of
the colonies for lwO from tariff duties and
the like amounts to $8,226,470, while the
deficit, it Is- stated, reached $6,977,922.
The ideal relations between a colony
and ' a mother country, says Harris, are
those which permit tho colony to produce
the raw material which the mother coun
try receives and pays back In a manu
factured state, but, in accordance with
the irresistible law Of economics, a col
ony with great material resources will
emancipate itself gradually from the
mother country. "It is doubtful, how
ever," continues Harris,- "whether this
will shortly be true of any of the present
colonies Of Germany."
In almost every part of the world. It is
Stated, where Germany's acquisitions are
Bituated, there is in the immediate neigh
borhood a colony of Great Britain or
some other country which is better able
to produce colonial products. "Great
Britain," says Harris, "either directly or
through the medium of her colonies has
a monopoly of almost half the commerce 1
of the German dependencies." .
The commercial development of German
Southwest Africa, Harris states, "will one
day probably be retarded by the competi
tion and aggressiveness of Cape Colony."
Tables are submitted showing that Ger
many's share in the exports of her own
colonies is only 50 per cent, while of all
the products required by her dependencies
the mother country supplies only about
60 j>Â«r cent.
passengers are buried under the debris
caused by the slide, but no names can be
ascertained of any passengers known to
he missing. The train to which the mis
hap occurred was known as No. 7. It
left LyncuÂ«/urg behind schedule time, and
consisted of an engine, tender, baggage
car and one passenger car which was
practically well filled with travelers.
It lrt stated that the train had run Into

Sa "Out of darkness has come light and
immense and wondrous strides have taken
place. A year ago everything outside of
Manila was practically chaos: now, out
side of the few provinces where the insur
rection still exists, everything is in a most
flourishing condition. In the 300 miles
from Manila north to Aparri not a hos

while houses have been built and are still
building and crops have been planted.
These same conditions apply to the larger

and that their leaders were doing all in
their power to bring the remaining insur

HEAD OF MANILA
FIRE DEPARTMENT
Roosevelt Tenders Place
to a Former Chief of
New York City.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â From a. rellablft
source comes the information that ex>
Fire Chief Hugh J. Bonner is considering
a proposition made by President Roosevelt
and the War Department to reorganize on
New York lines the fire department in Ma
nila. It is said that- such was Bonner*a
business in Washington during the week
just ended. Bonner, when, seen to-day,
practically admitted that such a plan is in
contemplation.
The tender of the appointment to Bonner
was made in consequence of a. cablegram
from the Philippine Commission, to Colo
nel Edwards, chief of the Insular Bureau
of the War Department, asking that the
best available man for the head of the
Manila fire department be recommended
to them. The cablegram said that a
strictly flrst-class man to organize the de
partment was wanted. After some inqui
ries Hugh J. Bonner was decided upon as
in every respect the best selection that
could be made. He came to Washington
-not quite a week ago, went over the situ
ation and when he left was given about
a week to think over the matter of his ac
ceptance of the. post, he not being pre
pared to give an immediate answer.
It is believed that he will probably ac
cept. A law was passed some time ago
creating the fire department. The original
chief of it Is no longer, in the service and
it was decided to secure a man of experi
ence and ability. The place will pay from
$3000 to $3500 a year.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â Both the ser
vice papers, the Army and Navy Regis
ter and the Army and Navy Journal, In
their issue comment adversely on the
reprimand administered by Secretary
Root to Lieutenant General Miles. The
Journal says:
According to the army regulations, a repri
mand such as was administered to the lien
tenant general can only be administered on the
verdict of & court-martial. Even a non-com
missioned officer is under the protection of tho
regulations, which direct of&cers to bÂ© cautious
in reproving htm fn the presence or hearing of
private soldiers. 13 it not incumbent that at
least equal consideration should be shown to tha
officer commanding?
The Register says:
Tho impression prevails that the tone of the
Root letter la unnecessarily severe â all out of
proportion to the offense. There are even those
who think the language employd is brutal and
that the publicity given the correspondence was
a cruel advertisement of the President's dis
pleasure.

hama to the effect that the long-slumber
ing rebellion in Formosa has again broken
out. The Fcnnosan rebels have been gath
ering their forces In the central part of
tie island for months, with the object of
striking a body blow at Japan's authority
at tile first opportunity.
The first disturbance came late In No
vember when a party of over 100 coolies,
engraged In transporting camphor, were
attacked by the Insurgents. Twenty of
them were kCied, all but one having their
beads cut off. This beheading results
from an offer of prizes by the rebel lead
ers for all heads of Japanese and their
employes brought Into caxap.
This event w&s the flrsc notice the Ja
p&nese authorities had that hostilities
Trere resumed. A strong party of Japan

PORT TOW2CSEXD, Wash., Dec 29.â
Advices from Xeah Bay are to the effect
that a large amount of wreckage is being
found on the beach south of Cape Flat
tery, among which is a. large broken row
boat, several oars and life-preservers,
hatches, broken doors and a quantity of
boards probably belonging to the deck
house of scrne vessel. Some bedding was
also found on various parts of the beach.
From information at hand no clew Is fur
liislied by taese ends, though it is thought
the wreckage is part of the collier Mat
tea v/an.
Victoria and Vancouver Island are com
pletely cut off from telegraph communica
tion, all cabies to the island having been
broken by the numerous vessels which
dragged anchor during the Christmas
night storm and it will be some time be
fore the cables can be repaired. \
Mail advices from Victoria state v that
Â«he siiip Santa Ciara is fast on Flatrock.
"ugs made an unsuccessful attempt to
.aul her off. The vessel is on her beam
tics and the tide ebbs and flows in a
fioJe. The vessel is being dismantled. The
i nipping men express the opinion that the
vessel will ljecome a total wreck, but the
captain of the Sauta Clara has hopes of
saving her, providing the weather con
tinues favorable.
The ship Bankburn, for â which so much
ar.xiety was felt, has been located at
False Bay San Juan Island. She had
drifted a distance of twenty miles. Her
anchor chains had not parted, as at first
supposed, and when found by the tug
Hope she was in twenty-two fathoms of
water â¢with 105 fathoms of chain out. She
will be towed to Fraser River.
A life buoy "was picked up yesterday at
Cadbcro Beach, on Vancouver Island, and
sent to Captain Gaudin, local agent of the
Marine and Fisheries at Victoria. The
buoy is painted white with the letters
and figures: "W. 10 W." No other wreck
age was found and to what vessel the
buoy belonged is a mystery.
The tug Colman, which broke her shaft
last night while towing- the brigantine Ir
win to this city, was picked up by the
tug Vigilant and towefl here. When
picked up she had drifted remarkably
close to the rocky shores of Vancouver
Island.

EON SEES HIS FATHEB
PEBISH IN THE SUBS'
Boy Who Witnesses a Tragedy Ees-
cues His Brother From a Peril
ous Position.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 29.â Joel B.
Leonhard of Fairhaven lost his life dur
ing Thursday's storm while attempting to
tan.e his boat, the destruction of which
was threatened, to a place of safety. He
had traveled last summer in the same
boat from Nome across the Arctic Sea
to Bellingham Bay. While rowing the
boat across Bellingham Bay it was
blown against a boom of logs, throwing
Leonhard and his son Albert into the
water. Leonhard attempted to swim but
became chilled and sank from sight
within a hundred yards of shore before
help could reach him.
Albert caught a log and endeavored
unsuccessfully in the waves to get on
top of the boom. Henry, his elder
brother, had been a spectator of his
lather's death without being able to help
him. Seeing his brother tlinging to the
log. he knew that unless rescued within
:i few minutes he also would join his
lather. The waves were running four
feet high, tossing the greai-Wg boom up
and down like chaff. It v/as on this
boom that Henry started to rescue his
brother. Leaping from one log to an
other he finally reached the exhausted
lioy, snatched him from the water and
lifting him into his arms made his peril
ous way to shore.

Witnesses in the Case Are Expected to Have a Clash Before

ALTURAS, Dec. 29.â With the clos

Secures Possession of the Jewels While Family Is at Church and
Disappears Before Theft Is Discovered.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.-Mr and Mrs.
Pad Thebaud of Madison ave
nue were robbed to-day of jew
elry worth $50,000. Thebaud re-
ported the robbery at.headquar
ters, where in company with a member
of the firm from which most of the jew
elry had been purchased, he gave the
police a partial list of the jewels taken.
The valuables consisted In part of one
pear-shaped diamond, said by Thebaud to
be worth $20,000; one pearl weighing 44
grains, said to be worth $15,000, and 300
small ornaments, making up a total of
about $50,000.
The robbery is said by the police and
also by Thebaud to have been the work
of a newly engaged valet, who had been
employed by Thebaud but two weeks.
The valet is missing and the butler, who
recommended him, is under constant po

nesses < outside of court and threats In
Modoc County are things not lightly to be
considered. The activity of the prosecu
tion in the case of Brown, who is the
present defendant, has provoked wrath
among all the persons wlio have for weeks
been trying to block the legal proceedings
and shield the culprits. A serious clash
is expected some time during the week.
Assistant Attorney General Post, whose
admirable handling of the celebrated Llt
tlefleld and Round Valley feud cases at
Weaverville in Trinity County a few years
ago has well fitted him for the duty Im
posed on him here, said to-day:
Prosecution Is Hopeful.
"The prosecution is making good head
way with the trial. We will put up a
case in which no fair jury can do other
wise than convict. The evidence will be
plain and we think we have a good,
square, impartial jury. The evidence for
the prosecution will all be In by Friday
Plains yesterday as the guests of Mr.
and Mrs. Howard Willets. They were to
spend Sunday with the Willets family.
The valet accompanied them. This morn
ing the Willets, accompanied by Mr. and
â¢ Mrs. Thebaud and several other guests,
1 went to church. Soon after their return
Mrs. Thebaud discovered that her dia
mond and pearl were gone, but fo*jj*i
that little else had been taken. ThebSrld
at once communicated by telephone with
the housekeeper of the residence in this
city and it was discovered that the other
valuables had been stolen.
The valet was last seen about 6 o'clock
this morning, when he took one of How
ard Willets' rigs and drove to the rail
way station In White Plains. Three hours
later the rig was found at the station
abandoned. It is supposed .the valet,
whose name is Kern, left town on an out
going train soon after he drove to the
station. The New York police late to-
or Saturday of this week. We do not
know how long it will take the defense
to get in Its evidence. It -may be a
month or it may be three months. We
will try the other two defendants sep
arately, but I cannot say when. We have
a plain case and are sure of a convic
tion."
One of the picturesque characters at the
trial is Judge G. F. Harris, who is an
attorney representing Brown, the alleged
leader of the mob that lynched Hall and
.the others. Harris was arrested the other
day on complaint of Mary Lorenz, one of
the leading witnesses for the prosecution.
She was standing in Laird's store when
Harris entered and, it is alleged, made an
insulting remark about Calvin Hall. Mary

who was lynched, and she displayed her
anger by slapping the face of the Judge.
Then he attacked her with a knife. Har
ris immediately had the woman arrested

of the Japanese Legislature Is Implicated
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 29.â A
German named Theyerson is lan
guishing in a Japanese prison on
the charge of having attempted to
kill the Emperor of Japan. A
former njember of the Japanese Legisla
ture, who was mixed up in the same al
leged attack on his Majesty has been pro
visionally pardoned and will probably not
be punished. His name is Tanaka Shoso.
It apoears that this Japanese was the
political agent of the German, who was
Interested in the Ashiwo copper mine.
This valuable property was . recently
seized by the Government because of al
leged irregularities and the company and
Theyerson were much hampered. Theyer
son is said to have attempted to kill the
Emperor in revenge for the way in which
the Government had treated him.
Theyerson and Shoso were at the en
trance to the palace grounds when the im
perial equipage came along. The Japan
ese ran up toward the Emperor's carriage
with a paper in his hand, but he was
stopped by the guard and forced back.
The German witnessed the rebuff and in
anger he drew a revolver. He, too, jumped
toward the carriage, but only took a -step

BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 29.â Phllo Jew
ett, son of Solomon Jewctt, president of
the Kern Valley Bank,, was assaulted
last night at F and Twentieth streets by
two footpads. Jewett was struck in the
mouth with a revolver, the force of th'e
blow knocking him unconscious. The
weapon was discharged, the bullet enter
ing his left arm above the wrist.
jewett was on his way to the home of
L. F. McClure about 8 o'clock in the
evening. As he was within one door of
his destination two men leaped from
behind a fence and dealt Jewett a blow
which severely lacerated the young
man's lips. The accidental discharge of
the pistol frightened away the highway
men before they could rob him. Many
residents of the neighborhood heard' the
shot, but failed to make an investiga
tion and the men made their escape.
Jewett was partially unconscious about
an hour. He came to his senses while
wandering on Nineteenth street. Physi

VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 29.â Spencer's
Arcade, Victoria's big department store,
was gutted by fire and flooded with water
last night. The loss Is estimated at a
quarter of a million dollars and the insur
ance amounts to about $125,000.
The fire, was caused by a cross wire in
the carpet department. Before it was dis
covered the' place was full of smoke and
the flames were leaping through the roof
and front walls. The firemen managed to
keep the fire In the one store, which ex

Terrible Crime Oommit-
ted in a Room at
Stockton.
Murderer of a Woman Beats
and Kicks the Victim's
Body.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
STOCKTON, Dec. 29.â A murder seldom
equaled for brutality was committed
early this morning. A woman known as
Lena Young was killed in her apartments
at a lodging-house at the corner of Sutter
street and Weber avenue, and George
Gribble is in jail charged with the crime.
The woman's maiden name was Lena
Wood. She claimed to be Gribble s wife,
and the two had been occupying tha
apartments for some time.
The murder took place some time be
tween midnight and 5 o'clock thi3 morn
ing. Shortly after 5 o'clock a telephone
message to the police office summoned
the police to the house. Gribble was
found in the hall in an excited frame of
mind, with face and hands covered witn
blood. He was arrested Immediately. Ha
declared that the woman had come home
badly beaten and that he put her to bed.
She arose, after which he again placed her
in the bed, and she died there in a few
moments.
The woman was> frightfully beaten,
there being evidences of her having been
jumped on. Her body In front was a mass
of cuts and abrasions, and her face had
been beaten out of recognition. She had
also been strangled and much of her hair
torn out by the roots. The room bore
evidence of a terrible life and death
struggle, blood having been spattered and
daubed over the walls and furniture, and
there was also considerable blood upon
the floor.
The murder created considerable excite
ment in town, and hundreds of people
viewed the remains in the morgue.
The officers do not believe Gribble's
story. The woman was seen intoxicated
on the street as late as 11 o'clock the
night before. Little is known of her here,
but Gribble has been a gambler here for
several months. It has been his habit to
work on ranches during the summer and
to make saloons and gambling halls his
headquarters during the winter. He was
known as "Alcohol George" about the re
sorts he frequented, on account of hi3
penchant for drinking alcohol.
The woman claimed to have two broth
ers in business in San Francisco. Gribble
said in Jail that she was not his wife.
The Coroner's jury claimed that the de
ceased came to her death by strangula
tion and. bodily injuries Inflicted by
George Gribble.

CLOSE OF THE BUSINESS YEAR.
THE close of the year is bringing out the usual
annual reviews of trade, and they are ex
tremely flattering. Prosperous as the preced
ing four or five years were, they have been exceeded
in many important points by 1901. First, the bank
clearings of the country, which are accepted as the
best and, in fact, about the only reasonably accurate
index to the condition of business, were $118,000,
000,000, a gain of 38 per cent over last year and 26
per cent over the record year of 1899. The greatest
increase, and therefore the greatest activity, was in
the Middle States, The failures, however, were
10,885 (with liabilities of $130,000,000 and assets of
$60,000,000), an increase of 8.6 per cent over 1000,
and almost 12 per cent over those in 1899. But then
a largely increased volume of business would natur
ally result in some increase in the number of fail
ures, to say nothing of the growth of population in
the country.
Some cf the details of this expansion in domestic
trade are an increase of 14 per cent in the production
of pigiron over the highest previous record, larger
shoe and leather production, 10 per cent increase in
llie coal output, and a wide and almost general ad
vance in the price of food products, the latter result
ing in, or rather from, higher-priced farm products.
This latter advance, however, has been partially off
set by decreased yield in some crops. The net rail
way earnings during the year are 16 per cent larger
than the best previous record, and had not cars been so
scarce this percentage of increase would have shown
a still higher gain. The scarcity of cars was due to
the remarkable trade activity, and extended all over
the country^ Nor has this blockade yet been relieved,
though the various works are turning out cars as
fast as they can make their machinery go. These
are only a few points of gain. Were anything like
a detailed list attempted a large amount of space
would be necessary.
There were some unfavorable conditions, however.
The South has not done as well with its cotton as in
some previous 3'ears, and the foreign trade of the
country has been gradually decreasing for several
months. The exports during the year thus far
amount to ? 1,435,000,000, or 1 per cent less than last
year, while the imports amount to at least $875,000,
000, an increase of 5.5 per cent. Thus it will be seen
that our exports to foreign countries are slowly de
creasing, while our imports from those countries are
slowly increasing. The balance of foreign trade is
no longer overwhelmingly in our favor.
A significant feature at the moment is the complete
reversal of conditions as compared with a year ago.
Then manufactures boomed and farm products were
more or less quiet, and in some lines actually dull.
Now farm products are relatively more active than
manufactures, and at higher prices. These two divi
sions of industry seem to take turns in precedence,
and when one is lively the other is apt to be the re
xcrse.
But the favorable largely outbalances the unfav
orable, as far as this years trade is concerned. If
some halt is observable at the close of the year, what
can we expect? We cannot go on forever breaking
all records, and there must be periods when the pub
lic, both here aod ir: Europe, become overbought
and curtail their demands upon the factory and the
farm. Such lulls have been witnessed several times
during the past two years, but have hitherto been
succeeded by renewed activity, and the present may
prove like the former conditions. Business has cer
tainly been falling off slightly of late, but the dimi
nution has been so narrow and gradual that it is not
perceptible to the general run of business men. It
has none of the aspect3 of collapse, and seems to be
an easy and healthy adjustment to normal conditions
during a period of remarkable commercial activitv
Jamestown, Va., was incorporated in 1507 and is
the oldest incorporated town in the United States. It
is going to celebrate its four hundredth anniversary
in 1907 and has begun making arrangements for an
exposition. It is the belief of the promoters of the
enterprise that they can give the town a new start
and enable it hereafter to grow a little bit in spite
of its age. '.} >.::
i THE CUBAN DEMAND.
THE Cuban junta does not relax its efforts for
free trade in sugar and tobacco with this coun
try. It has accurate knowledge of our politics
and knows exactly how to produce results by indirec
tion. It keenly takes advantage of every circum
stance that may increase its footing. The appoint
ment of a Secretary of the Treasury from Iowa
opened the way to get rid of Secretary Wilson, from
the same State. Of course the organs of the junta
did not say that Wilson should go because as Secre
tary of Agriculture he is an outspoken advocate of
the interests of the American farmer and believes in
using protection to domesticate here profitably every
possible addition to our farm crops. Since he went
into office under President McKinley he has sup
ported the beet sugar industry with the greatest
force, and the gratifying increase therein is greatly
due to his interest. But the junta says. nothing of
all this. Its organs discover a political reason in not
having two Cabinet officers from a. sure Republican
State like Iowa. For the time being, at least, their
cunning fails to be effective, but it may be expected
that they will not cease to nag every member of the
Cabinet who is opposed to their scheme for crippling
or extirpating two important agricultural interests in
this country in order to enrich the Cuban planters
whom they represent.
The farmers' interests in this subject should lead
them to be alert. The junta is sleepless and will lose
no tricks. The farmers of the country should make
known their sentiment in support of Secretary Wil
son, and the members of Congress should not be left
in doubt as to rural sentiment. â¢
What beet, sugar means to the land-owner is re
vealed in such form as the news dispatch from Santa
Mari* California, published Saturday. The beet
sugar mill there has just closed a successful season
and is to be enlarged to work up a greater acreage
of beets. The farmers report a net profit of $55 per
acre on their beets, and in addition to this the com
pany distributes prize money among them as a pre
mium on their crop.
In Michigan, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, New
York and every State where beet sugar mills are
operated the .experience is the same. The farmer
gets a larger profit on his beets than on any other
crop, and thejreturn is immediate and in cash.
Capital is hesitating about building more mills in
every State where production of the beet is demon
strated to be successful. This hesitation is caused by
the aggressiveness of the junta and the uncertainty
of the final attitude of certain politicians.
The junta has proclaimed Iowa as a sure Repub
lican State. There is a tone of warning in the rural
districts that may well be listened to, lest sure Repub
lican States become few.
The Pan-American Congress agreed that there
should be reciprocity of trade among American coun
tries, that the Pan-American railway project should
be carried out and that a Pan-American bank should
be established, but as for arbitration on interna
tional disputes the congress leaves that to The
Hague court. Under the circumstances it might as
well have referred the other things to the same
tribunal.
AMERICAN ADVERTISING.
a MERICAN invasions of the markets of Eu-
ZA rope arc not always provocative of animosity.
*â  *- In Great Britain at least they sometimes take
our competition as well as our goods with a genial
humor. There are times when they are even moved
to smile at the ingenuity of our methods. Just at
present, for illustration, the London papers are pub
lishing as a pleasant bit of fun the circular recently
sent out by an American firm soliciting British trade
for what are known in commercial circles as "hog
products."
The circular says: "To our friends across the sea
we send greeting. As the years roll by we are drawn
nearer and nearer together by Christian Blood and
Money Ties, and may this ever be. We are located in
a section that grows a pig that, for leanness and qual
ity, comes nearer to your home-grown and Canadian
pigs than any that can be raised in any part of the
States. We are now putting up a class of light fancy
English and Irish meats that, for delicacy of cure and
extreme mildness, cannot be furnished by any other
packing company in the Great West. Your wants can
always be supplied by our friends and sole agents."
The object of advertising is to catch the attention,
the fancy and the custom of the public, and conse
quently since that hog firm's circular has caught the
British it may be accounted excellent. It appears,
however, from reports that we are not always so suc
cessful when we undertake to please the foreigner by
our methods of making known our goods.
Some time ago an American manufacturer of agri
cultural machinery sent to Germany for distribution a
large number of bright lithographs displaying his
goods. One of these represented a young
woman in the costume of a Greek goddess
driving a mower drawn by two tigers. Short
ly after the distribution several Germans stated
to an American Consul that such machinery
would be of no value and have no sale in Germany
because in that country the farmers are not used to
employing tigers in drawing their machines.
Thus it will be see.n the American advertiser who
seeks foreign custom must rely more upon words
than upon pictures. Had the hog product man sent
to England a picture of one of his lean pigs instead
of his Chicagoesque description he probably would
not have sold a side of bacon. Advertising is an art
that must be practiced in accord with national char
acteristics.
A GERMAN IRELAND.
ONLY a short time ago the Germans found in
the events of the South African war an op
portunity to assert themselves the support
ers of freedom and the foes of tyranny. They made
the most of it. Great mass-meetings were held to
express German sympathy with the brave Boers
fighting for liberty and to denounce the aggressive
British as the murderers of a brave and Christian
people. Now, however, the whirligig of time has
brought about its " revenge. The disturbances in
Prussian Poland have caught the attention of the
world and the British are now enjoying the satisfac
tion of declaring sympathy with the oppressed Poles
and denouncing the tyranny of the Germans.
When the Polish question was recently brought up
for discussion in the Reichstag the Chancellor de
clared it to be a Prussian and not a German ques
tion, and it seems he is right, for the laws of which
the Poles complain are Prussian and not German
laws. Kaiser Wilhelm, it appears, has been im
pressed by the act' of the Czar in Russianizing Fin
land and has sought to ; imitate his example. The
Poles under the dominion of the Prussian crown
have retained the Polish language and the Catholic

religion. The Kaiser has .sought to transform them
into Prussians by. compelling them to speak German
and become Lutherans. The result has been a
clamor that has been heard over Europe, and all
Germany is being held responsible for it.
A shprt time ago a number of Polish Catholic
children at Wreschen were said to have been so se
verely flogged by their Prussian school teachers for
refusing to learn German prayers and hymns that
several of them were crippled for life. The parents
took up the cause of their children, and many of
them were subjected to severe punishment in the way
of fines and imprisonment. Then the Polish nobles
espoused the cause of the people, and, finding no way
for redress in Prussia, have appealed to the Reichstag
and to the Catholics of South Germany.
The action of the Prussian Government in striving
to stamp out Polish nationality is in itself nothing
new, but for a long time no severe measures were
taken to that end, so that the present drastic policy
of the Government is not easy to understand. The
objection to Catholicism is particularly difficult to
explain, since Catholic nobles of other parts of Ger
many are high in favor at Berlin, and it is only in
Prussian Poland that any fight is being made against
the church. The only explanation thus far given is
that the Kaiser has been persuaded that the racial
and national sentiments of the Poles are being fos
tered by their priests and that it is necessary to
make the people Lutherans before he can make them
Prussians.
How far Russian experience in Finland and in
Russian Poland may furnish encouragement for the
Kaiser's policy cannot, be accurately estimated, for
Russian affairs are kept under cover of so much dark
ness that very little is known of them except their
capacity to generate anarchy, but the Kaiser can find
a potent warning against his policy in the record of
what Great Britain has achieved in her efforts to
stamp out the 'spirit of nationality in Ireland. If the
Kaiser be wise he can study that story with profit.
Mining experts are said to have estimated that the
Kimberley mines can continue to yield dia
monds at the present rate for 144 years to co.me,
and accordingly people who have not yet laid irw their
stock of diamonds need not fret. They can get them
later.
IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that not only is Congress certain of re
enacting the Chinese restriction law, but the
chances are good for the passage of a general immi
gration bill which will remedy the defects in the pres
ent law and prevent much of the objectionable immi
gration that now pours into the country from other
nations than China.
A bill representing the views of Commissioner
General Powderly and other experts in the matter of
immigration has been introduced into Congress and
has found strong support. The aim of the framers of
the measure is to embody in' one act all necessary
provisions relating to immigration, to eliminate
from existing statutes whatever experience has
shown to be objectionable, to amend the sections
which have not stood the test of the courts, and to
add to the present lav/ whatever is required to meet
the needs of the time with respect to aliens seeking
admission to the country.
One of the notable features of the new measure is
a provision for the inspection abroad of persons de
siring to come to the United States, and, secondly,
for the supervision here of all immigrants admitted,
so that they may be deported if within a period of
five years they are found to be criminals or paupers.
For the purpose of providing partly at least for the
inspection and supervision it. is provided that the
head tax en aliens coming into the country shall be
raised from $1 to $3 and is to be imposed upon those
entering by land as well as upon those entering by
sea, but exceptions are made in favor of citizens of
Canada and of Mexico.
The bill prescribes that there shall be excluded
from the United States all idiots, insane persons,
paupers, persons likely to become a public charge;
persons afflicted with a loathsome or with a dangerous
contagious disease; persons" who have been convicted
of crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude;
polygamists, anarchists or persons who advocate the
overthrow of government, or the assassination of
public officials; persons whose migration to the
United States has been induced by offers, solicita
tions, promises or agreements, express or implied, of
labor or work or service; any person whose pas
sage is paid for with money of another, or who is as
sisted by others to come, unless it is satisfactorily
shown that such person does not belong to one of
the excluded classes, but this is not to be held to pre
vent persons living in the United States from send
ing for a relative or friend who is not of the ex
cluded classes.
The bill does not exclude persons who in othef
countries have been convicted of offenses purely po- â¢
litical and not involving moral turpitude, nor the im
portation of skilled labor when such labor is not to be
found unemployed in the United States. Further
more, the clause forbidding the importation of "con
tract labor" does not include under that head profes-.
sional actors, artists, lecturers or musicians, ministers
of any religious denomination, professors for col
leges or seminaries, persons belonging to any rec
ognized learned profession, or persons employed
strictly as personal or domestic servants.
The bill has been carefully prepared by men who
have long been earnest students of immigration
problems and is much better than the laws that now
prevail. It will of course undergo a close scrutiny in
the House and a long debateÂ»upon it can be counted
on when it comes before the Senate. There will be,
therefore, ample opportunity to rid it of any defects
that may exist and still bring about its passage at
this session. There has been an urgent demand for
legislation in this direction, and it is full time the de
mand was satisfied.
Kaiser Wilhelm declares he can force Venezuela
to terms by merely seizing the customs duties at the
principal Venezuelan ports, but President Castro
says that should the seizure be made foreign mer
chants would suffer more than Venezuelans, so it
would seem Castro is willing to let the Kaiser go
ahead and take what he can get so long as he does
not invade the country. .
The country is now waiting to see whether the
famous New York arbitration committee is going to
do business or imitate the international high court of
arbitration appointed at The Hague Peace Con
ference.

RUSSIA PLANNING TO INCREASE ITS
RATING AS A POWER ON THE SEAS
RUSSIAN naval construction promises to be brisk during
the coming year. Five battleships of 12,000 tons and
20 knots are proposed, besides which there is the com
pletion of three cruisers, Oleg. Jemkchug and Izumred,
and a number of torpedo-boat destroyers. There are
on hand in home and foreign yards no less than sixty-six ves
sels of 298,575 tons, of which eleven, of 138,070 tons, are armored
ships. ,
The Russian cruiser Diana,' of 6730 tons, built at St. Peters
burg, had her steam trial November 13. The vessel drew 20
feet 10 inches on an even keel â two inches less than the In
tended draughtâ and was seventy tons short in her displace
ment. The three engines developed 12,129 horsepower, exceed
ing the contract by 519, but no information is given as to
whether the Intended speed of 20 knots was obtained. The
keel of the Diana was laid down in July, 1896, and the vessel
was launched October 12, 1899. The Diana has therefore been
five and a half years under construction, while the Variag of
the same type and tonnage was built for Russia at Cramp's
yard in about three years, the keel being laid October 13, 1898,
the vessel being launched October 31, 1899, and the last official
trial taking place October 1, 1900. '
The Russian cruiser Djiglt arid the Kniaz Pojarski', armored
coast defense ships, are being thoroughly overhauled at St.
Petersburg. The copper sheathing is being removed and zinc
sheathing substituted. The Djigit was ..built in 1876 and the
Kniaz Pojarski in 1867, and their wood-sheathed and coppered
bottoms do not appear to have caused the hulls to deteriorate
to any alarming degree. The substitution of zinc for copper
is in the line of economy, as the -vessels have naturally be
come obsolete and are not likely to last many more years.
* * *
The Amazone, a German protected cruiser oil 2800 tons,
went into commission November 15 last. She was built at the
Germania Yard, Kiel, being laid down September, 1899. Simi
lar vessels, named the Ariadne, Medusa and Thetis, begun at
the same time, are practically completed and two more not yet
named are in course of construction. ISermany will have in
these vessels seven useful cruisersâ fast, economical in steam
ing and with good batteries, consisting of ten 4-inch, ten 1
pounders, eight machine guns and two torpedo tubes. Their
engines of 8000 horsepower will give a speed of 21 to 22 knots,
and 'their coal capacity is 580 tons. Two of these cruisers, the
Gazelle and Niobe, are wood-sheathed and coppered.
The British Admiralty has ordered four more 160-foot tor
pedo-boats of 25 knots speed from Thornycroft.
A detective employed by the Admiralty in the Devonport
dockyard had a narrow escape recently while endeavoring to
spot the workmen who were loafing. He was passing under
the battleship Queen, in course of construction, when a piece
of steel weighing nine pounds was dropped from above and
fell right in front of the detective. The yard officials have
made strenuous efforts to find out who was responsible for this
"carelessness," but had not succeeded at last accounts, .and
the detective has thrown up a job which he has reason to be
lieve is extra hazardous.

tive to the great Spanish highway of Cali

TO RENEW FRIENDSHIP-Sunburst.
Oakland, Cal. What is suitable as a gift
to renew friendship that has been severed
between two persons, depends upon the
best judgment of the one who desires to
offer the olive branch of peace. It is not
the value of a gift that cuts any figure in
such a case, but the spirit in which it Is
given. Anything that would be useful to
the prospective recipient or that could be
used daily would serve as a constant re
minder of a friendship lost and renewed.
NOT A DETECTIVE AGENCYâ C., Oak
land, Cal. The department of Answers to
Correspondents was established to furnish
information of a general character, and
does not undertake to set "one of its men
with nothing to do on the trail to find out
the name and occupation of the facher,
the maiden name and residence of the
mother and, if possible, the present resi
dence of the mother and child" In the
case of a child that was born in 1899. This
is purely a personal and private matter,
and if you wish that information you had
better secure the services of a private de
tective agency.
TAPIOCAâ J. A., Portervllle, Cal. Tapi
oca is produced from the root of the
manioc, a large, shrubby plant, native of
South America, but also extensively culti
vated in South Africa and other tropical
countries. Manioc, or mandioca, is the
Brazilian name for this plant. In -She
West Indies it is called cassava, and in
Peru Its name is yucca. The plant grows
In a bushy form from six to eight feet
high, sometimes higher. The stems are
large and pithy, the branches crooked,
the leaves growing in a cluster at the
end of the branches. The roots are very
large, turnip-like, sometimes we!ghln<*
thirty pounds, from three to eight grow"
ing in a cluster, usually from a foot to
two feet in length. They contain a very
poisonous milk juice, but as the poison
ous quality results from the presence of
hydrocyanic acid this can be easily and
entirely removed by boiling. When the
poison ls driven out the juice ls made into
a sauce, quite peppery, in flavor, which is
very wholesome as a condiment and much
liked by the South Americana, it is also
sweetened, with molasses, fermented and
converted into an intoxicating drink
After the juice is pressed out the root Is
grated, dried on hot metal plates and then
powdered, this substance becoming a fa
vorite kind of farinn. The starch of the
root is obtained by allowing the juice to
stand for some time after boiling when
the starch settles to the bottom This is
washed and dried on hot plates, and dur
ing the process of heating the starch is
stirred with an ironrod, the grains burst
some of the starch is converted into dex
trine and the whole agglomerates into
small, irregular masses. This Is what is
known as the tapioca of commerce

Among the picturesque mountains of

question that M. Glangeaud tried to an

Academy.

said, are generally of a porous nature and

BLACK PATTI'S
SINGERS PLEASE
Celebrated Troupe Opens
Week at California
Theater.
Entertaining Plays Are on
at All the Local
Playhouses.
Black Patti'a Troubadours opened their
engagement at the California Theater last
evening. Black PattI was in excellent
voice and sang old Bongs that tended to
revive many pleasant memories. The
performance has improved since the last
\islt, the chorus singing being especially
effective. All the turns -go with a. snap
and dash and the many good things on
the programme should cause a good
week's business.
Principal among the entertainers Is
Mack Allen, a slack wire equilibrist, who
does some new "stunts" -with skill. Al
Watts and John Rucker are " heard in
some clever comedy -work) and the male
quartet was recalled several times for Its
splendid rendition of vocal numbers. The
buck dance, which concluded the opening
farce, "A Filipino Mis-Fit." displayed the
agility of several members of the troupe.
The singing of "My Drowsy Babe" by the
Misses Forcen and Green pleased the
large audience present. The cakewalk,
as usual, made the hit of the evening,
and on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
evenings the contest for a gold medal,
open to all comers, will take place. Next
Sunday evening "Whose Baby Are You?"
begins a week's engagement.
Joe Welch, who completely captivated
the Orpheum audiences during the first
half of his engagement here, is again the
feature of this week of an extraordinar
ily good bill at that theater.
Welch has made an entire change in his
monologue, and, if anything, it is cleverer
than his earlier act. No monologulst ever
on the coast has created the furore that
greets Welch's appearance on the stage
and continues until he leaves it. Last
night the house was in an uproar
throughout Welch's turn axid he was nois
ily encored a half dozen times.
Picolo's llliputians, four in number, give
a wonderful comedy and gymnastic enter
tainment and immediately established
themselves in popular favor.
Mclntyre and Heath contribute the best
act; they do "The Man From Montana."
Elizabeth Murray sings coon songs
fetchingly and tells a series of new jokes.
Also on the programme are Anglos
trio, Hitter's trained dogs, W. C. Fields
and the Union Gatling Guards.
What promised to be an insurmountable
obstacle to Mclntyre and Heath's per
formance turned up just before the time
for them to begin. Otto* Johnson, their
assistant, was doing a sleight-of-hand act
at a neighboring theater and forgot the
clock.
Mclntyre. who makes Johnson the par
ticular butt of his best jokes, was in a
flurry, and the audience waited.
As a means out of the dilemma Harrv
Orndorff, the Orpheum's stage manager,
volunteered as a "fall guy." He knew
nothing of the dialogue, but ordered the
curtain up and went bravely on with the
comedian to take his medicine.
Orndorff was immediately recognized
and got a rousing reception from the reg
ulars scattered over the house. He ac
quitted himself most creditably until the
belated Johnson walked on the stage and
Orndorff backed off.
While Orndorff was doing his "stunt"
the bartenders forsook their business and
the doorkeepers crowded down the line
to witness the stage manager's debut as
an actor.
Johnson was good-naturedly jollied by
the audience for his tardiness. It evi
dently thought he had got stranded on
the cocktail route.
Mary Mannering with "Janice Mere
ofth" will remain the attraction at the
Columbia Theater for another week, with
matinees on New Year's day and Satur
day. The charming young woman has won
all hearts by her beauty and talent and
her engagement promises to be one of the
most successful of the season. Miss Man
nering Is excellently supported by the
strong company she brings with her, all
of the many parts in the cast being un
dertaken with much skill and intelligence.
On Thursday next at a special matinee
"Camille" will be put on, with Miss Man
nerlng in the title role. It is Miss Man
nering's first appearance In the role and
therefore an occasion of peculiar interest
to play-goers. H. S. Northrup, Charles
Cherry, Amy Ricard and Robert Drouet
will also appear in the cast.
The New Year's bill at the Grand
Opera House is to be the pretty comedy
â¢'A Lady of Quality," by Stephen Town
tend and Frances Hodgson Burnett. Miss
Minnie Seligman will appear in the title
role and will do justice to its attraction.
She will be well supported by the Grand
Opera House stock company. A special
matinee is announced for New Year's
day. The part is said to be one of the best
in Miss Sellgman's repertoire and the play
one of the most popular.
The Alcazar has too good a thing in
"Charley's Aunt" to change the bill this
week at lÂ»ast. All the principal members
of the company have congenial parts in
the hilarious farce, Frank Bacon in par
ticular having a beautiful opportunity as
Lord Babbcrlev.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1901.
MRS. GOULD'S CHANGE
OF MIND SAVES SON
Plot of Kidnapers Is Remarkable for Its
Boldness and Ingenuity.
Special Dispatch, to Th.6 Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â Police Commissioner Mur
phy to-day pronounced the plan to kidnap the 12
year-old son of George J. Gould as the boldest and
~ most ingenious criminal conspiracy in the history
of the New York police. But for the fact that Mrs. Gould
changed her mind, and, instead of leaving the operarhouse
at 4 o'clock, as she ordered, waited until the close of the
performance, it might have succeeded.
Two swift automobiles, instead of one, were to have
been used by the abductors. They were gasoline machines
of an identical pattern. The color and trimmings of both
vehicles were in the same style and the chauffeurs were
dressed alike from top to toe. A boy about the age of
young Jay Gould was to have .been used to add to the con
fusion. It was not difficult to have him so clad on the ap
pointed day as to present a general resemblance to the 12
year-old heir to millions. The most hot-footed pursuers
would have been perplexed, according to the plan of the
plotters, if the two automobiles were speeding in different
directions, each vehicle and its occupants agreeing in every
detail with the description given by those who might have
chanced to see the start.
It was expected that the chance might come at 4
o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the hour at which Mrs.*
Gould ordered a public automobile to return for her at For
tieth-street entrance of the opera-house. This stretch of
sidewalk and street is little frequented at that hour, and ve
hicles do not block the way in either direction. It was ar
ranged that the two machines should meet side by side at
this entrance; when the Gould party should come out the
boy was to have been seized and thrown into one of them,
alongside a captor, while the decoy lad was to have been
picked up from the sidewalk in similar fashion. .
The police have not yet located the would-be kidnap-,
ers.
VAIN REGRETS
WASTE OF TIME
Rev. G. C. Adams Says
Something Regarding
Resolution.
Special Christmas services were held
yesterday at the First Congregational
Church. Both for the morning and even-
Ing service programmes were prepared
and the Rev. George C. Adams delivered
two addresses. His subject for the morn-
Ing sermon was the "Incarnation." In the
evening he addressed the congregation on
the timeliness of our resolutions. The
evening sermon was in part as follows:
When Jesus said. "Sleep on, take your rest.
Let us rise and be going." there was no con
tradiction. The time had passed when the
'three disciples might have comforted him in
his greatest agony. But he did not mean that
there was no other work to be -done One op
portunity had been lost, but there were others
of the future to be met.
So far as the year that is gone is concerned
take your rest. The chance for doing some
thing for God is gone. The manly thing is not
to waste time and rerrets over the past, but
to prepare for the future.
The beauty of Jesus Christ is that he always
gives us another chance. There are two ways.
Repentance doesn't mean the spending of time
In vain regrets, but going forward and push
ing our way over obstacles that stand before
us. Sometimes it takes our lifetime to know
what we might have been. . It is an awful
torment to realize our lost opportunities.
The opportunities in the year to come must
be met. We must be contented to make some
blunders. Let us begin with the new year
and turn over a new leaf, and with the light
of Jesus Christ and in God's presence let us
try to lead a life like Jesus Christ himself.
The pulpit of Emanuel Evangelical
Church was last night occupied by Hon.
George Barsoom, who lectured > upon the
subject "General Conditions of Christmas
in the Turkish Empire." An appropriate
Christmas sermon was delivered in the
morning by the Rev. F. W. Fischer.
At the First Baptist Church yesterday
morning the Rev. Edward J. Harper
preached on the subject, "The Transfigur
ation." In the evening his subject was
"Man a Responsible Being." Special
music was a feature at both services.
The Rev. J. A. B. Wilson discussed the
theme "The Story of a Star" at the How
ard-Street M. E. Church last night. A
fine programme of music was rendered.
"A New Year and a New Life" was the
subject of an eloquent discourse by the
Rev. John Stephens at the Simpson M. E.
Church last evening.
apparently been productive of the liveliest
satisfaction to Alcazar patrons.
The Central Theater will put on this
week Denman Thompson's favorite play,
"The Two Sisters." The drama will be
staged with the richness and attention to
detail that mark the whole effort of the
management and will be excellently cast.
The usual good specialties that have be
come a feature of this theater's pro
grammes will also be given and the usual
good audiences of the popular house will
doubtless find their way to the theater
this -week, with the attractive bill for bait.
"Little Red Riding Hood" at the Tivoli
Is -still drawing its multitudes. It Is the
right thing for the season, the right thing
for the baby, the right thing for the
grown-up, and no child should miss it, nor
any one who can borrow a baby as excuse
for going. Ferris Hartman has fitted out
the company with new songs and jokes of
the best, and Annie Myers, Ferris himself,
Edward Webb and Harry Cashman all
shine to the limit of their luminosity. The
transformation scene is a particular fa
vorite and the whole bill one of the most
attractive in the holiday repertoire.
Professor A. J. Topping, the mind
reader, is the star of Fischer's good bill
this week. Others on the list of clever
entertainers are the Sorensens, Paloma
Quartet. Mullen and Lord, Valkyra, Ethel
Culbreth. Coleman and Mexls, Billy John
son and Hinrichs' Orchestra.
The new bill which opens at the Chutes
to-day Includes Macomber and Engleton,
travesty artists; the Serenaders; Werden
and Shepard in illustrated songs; Deaves'
Merry Manikins; Hlnes and Kimball,
acrobatic marvels, and Coleman's per
forming dogs and cats: A series of new
moving pictures will also be shown.

annual entertainment and installation of

desk were beautifully decorated with the
Stars andiStripes and evergreens.
The first part of the programme was the

ning, George Lake, Daniel A. Sylvester,

through the courtesy of John Morrlssey of
the Orpheum, Otto C. Johnson with
sleight of hand tricks, Arnold Grazer and
Blanche Trelease in cakewalk and spe
cialties and W. C. Fields in his clever
juggling tricks. Then followed the Palo
ma Ladies' Quartet, from Fischer's Con
cert-house; Professor Topping, mind
reader; Professor Recke, zither selections;
Miss Edith Donovan, piano selections,
finely rendered; O. W. Harrold, songs; J.
McGrath, songs; Miss Addle Durang, reci

stories. The last number on the pro
gramme was the Manhattan Quartetâ H.
Colman, first tenor; Fred Scanlan, second
tenor; George Sweeney, first bass, and
Robert Davis, second bass â under the
management of Jack Holland. They were
broug-ht into court shackled by an officer
and placed In the dock, where they
charmed the audience with their sweet
singing.
'All the numbers were so thoroughly rel
ished that each performer was encored,
some of them three or four times.
AMATEUR GOLFER PLAYS
A SENSATIONAL GAME
T. C. Watrous Defeats Alex. Smith,
the Professional, by Six Points
on San Diego Links.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 29.â The golf links of
the Country Club -were the scene this
morning of some surprising play on the
part of T. C. Watroua, a member of the
club and an enthusiastic player.
Alex Smith, the professional, who has
charge of the Coronado links and who is
accounted one of the best players in the
country, was on this side of the bay on
a visit, and a game was started, In which
he and Watrous, Clarertce Sprigg and
George Hawley were to go over the nine
hole course of the Country Club.
Watrous had no thought of making a
phenomenal score, but he beat Smith,
whose score was 43, by six points. He
knocked one point off the "bogey" record,
which Is supposed to be the best a player
could make on the course. The course is
2425 yards long and has the usual number
of hazards for the players to overcome.

JOHN M'NAUGHT
STIRS AUDIENCE
Declares Democracy Is
Hesitating and
Halting. \
Co-operation of Few Never
Gets Beyond "Commun
ism of Pelf."
"The Progress of Democracy" was the
subject of John McNaught's address at
Pythian Hall last evening. The lecturer
spoke to a crowded, sympathetic and en
thusiastic audience â sympathetic because
the subject was near to them, and enthu
siastic because of the telling and pungent
arguments, with which they were in full
accord. Democracy, said the lecturer,
had heretofore nothing to fear In
going forward to its destined goal,
that of â¢ the completely organized
state â a state whose people would
work together and not against one
another, where the distribution of wealth
would be fairly accomplished and where
each man would have full equality of
rights and privileges..
Democracy, at the present time, is halt
ing and hesitating In almost every civil
ized country on the globe. It moved like
a man groping his way through the dark.
In one community it had advanced far
enough to perceive that the existence of
slums was a disgrace, not to the poor peo
ple who lived in them but to the rich so
ciety that tolerated them, and according
ly a democratic movement was slowly
eliminating the slums. In another com
munity, fully equal to the first in general
intelligence but lacking in this respect,
the people were halting and hesitating
over so simple a question as that of main
taining public waterworks.
So long as these differences of opinion
prevailed, so long would the grand onward
march of democracy halt and wait. There
was needed now a campaign of education
all along the line. Every association as
sisting in that education was a distinct
benefit to mankind. AVhoever helped to"
bring the masses of men to a clear concep
tion of the problem before them, and of
the only possible remedy for It, would, he
declared, contribute to the cause of hu
manity. The co-operation of a few men
never got beyond what President Cleve
land called "the communism of pelf," but
the co-operation of all men through their
self-chosen governments for the common
benefit of all was a fulfillment of the di
vine law that was slowly but surely mov
ing forward to the time when In every
civilized community there would be privi
leges for none but equal rights for all,
and that would be the realization of tri
umphant democracy.
CONVICT MUTINEERS PLOT
TO BBEAK PENITENTIARY
Another Prisoner Warns the Jailer3
in. Time to Frustrate the Pro
posed Delivery.
IjEAVENWORTH, Kans., .Dec. 29.â
Warden McClaughey of the United States
penitentiary headed off a plot yesterday
planned by five of the convict mutineers
of November 7, which embraced the pos
sible death of Deputy Warden Frank
Lemon and a guard. R. G. Brown, the
capture of the guards' armory and an
other delivery of prisoners. The ringlead
er in the plot is Gilbert Mullens, who held
up and disarmed Sheriff Cook and part of
the Topeka police force. Frank Thomp
son, the big negro, Frederick Robinson,
Bob Clark and Turner Barnes were the
other four. The plot was exposed by a
fellow convict, who overheard the muti
neers talking. â¢ Mullens had obtained a
file and another convict a caseknife. It
was planned to file off the shackles on
Saturday, when four convict barbers came
to shave the prisoners in the stone
breaking- shed, and after seizing- the
razors rush the guards.
GEHMAN EMPEROR ACCEPTS
COMPOSER'S EXPLANATION
Leoncavallo Says Delay in Translat
ing a Novel Put Him Back in
His Work.
VIENNA, Dec. 29.â The Fremdenblatt
this morning contains a statement by
Ruggiero Leoncavallo, the operatic com
poser, confirming the report that in 1894
Emperor William invited him to write an
opera on the novel entitled "Roland of
Berlin," by Wllhelm Haenig, known un
der the pseudonym of Wilbalad Alexis.
Owing to the composer's ignorance of the
German language he had to have the
novel translated. This necessitated a de
lay of some three years, which displeased
Emperor William. The Emperor has since
graciously accepted the composer's ex
planation of the delay.
Leoncavallo says the opera will be fin
ished and produced in Berlin next winter.

MIDWINTER OUTDOOR SPORTS AND PASTIMES ON MANY FIELDS
OUTSIDERS WIN
STAKE HONORS
Hard Coursing Develops
Some Clever Young
Greyhounds.
Kibosh Beats Vandal in the
Special Event at Union
Park.
Full Moon and Kibosh, greyhounds
â which were not expected to make more
than a fair showing, surprised the cours
ing patrons at Union Park yesterday by
winning final honors in their respective
stakes.
Victory In the deciding 1 course meant
graduation from the maiden class for
tither courser, neither having won stake
honors in previous meetings.
Kibosh in the special event did some
clever coursing, being forced to the hard
est kind of work to earn his position. In
the second round the Curtis dog was
given a severe trial in a course with D. J.
ilealey's For Glory, a 3 to 5 favorite, and
won after heavy scoring. In the next
round he beat Lady Clare handily, but
not without a tiring effort. Kibosh was
next slipped against Wedgewood, the
taake favorite. Jones' dog was the nat
ural choice of the wise ones, and his
thajices looked so easy that 5 to 1 was
offered by the talent that Wedgewood
would be returned a winner. The short
ender was not overlooked, at that price,
and at slip time a good 1 play was re
corded.
Wedgewood, as was expected, showed
the speed over his opponent. At the turn
the favorite was three lengths to the
good, but after losing possession evinced
a desire to lay off the game. In the work
Kibcsh showed to better advantage, and
when the lias was raised had outpointed
Wedgewood 10 to 7.
Narcissus was withdrawn in the fifth
round, and Kibosh was hurried to meet
Vandal in the final. Again the Curtis
kennel representative was on the short
end, -this" time at 3 to 5. Vandal led but
Kibosh outworked him and won bv one
point.
Full Moon, the winner In the open stake,
was a g-ood investment for the pikers.
Four of his five victories were over favor
ites, each time at 3 to 5. In the final,
against ilay Hempstead, he led and gave
up possession after making three points.
May evened the score, and Full Moon
dashed in for the kill.
Ihe hares were as lively as the pre
vious day's lot and v.-ere the cause of the
downfall of many favorites. In the course
between Red Rock and Greenhall the hare
took the pair a hard run of three min
utes and then beat them and three relief
dogs to the escape. Red Rock was with
drawn. Narcissus, too, fell a victim to
the strong hares. A total of twenty-three
escapes was recorded.
Following are the day's results, with

SMITH BROTHERS
WIN AT TENNIS
Take Handicap Doubles
Without Loss of
a Set.
George Whitney Captures
the Special Match
* Handily.
The Smith brothersâ Grant and Chetâ
won the tennis handicap doubles tourna
ment for the Davis cups yesterday at the
California Club's court without the loss
of a set.
Eight teams entered, Collier and Crow
ell, the holders, being the scratch team.
As a rule the handicapping was good and
each team had a fair chance. The win
ners have won the cups twice. Collier and
Crowell have won them three times,
"Whitney brothers and Grant Smith and
Ray Cornell twice. Smith will double up
with his brother hereafter in these tour
naments. The Whitney brothers will not
play for the cups again and the contests
seem to be between the Smith brothers
and Collier and Crowell.
In the first round Collier and Crowell al
lowed Dr. Lane and C. G. Kuehn odds of
"fifteen and four-sixths" and won 6 â 3,
S â 6. This handicap was small, but the
losers nearly won. Al Kenyon and Clyde
Beal received odds of "fifteen" from Her
bert Schmidt and Jack Gibson and after a
three-set match won by a score of 3â6,
6â3, 0â1. The Smith brothers allowed' Ben
Wood and R. S. Stubbs odds of "half
thirty" and -won in straight sets. 6 â 2, 6â3.
Drummond MacGavin and Homer Parker
played the longest match of the day with
James Code and Norman Hodgkinson. The
former allowed their opponents odds of
"half fifteen" and won 4â6, 8â6, 6â2. The
losers were within a point of winning tne
match in the second set.
In the second round Collier and Crowell
gave Beal and Kenyon a handicap of
"thirty and two-sixths" and lost after
winning the first set handily. The score
in favor, of Beal and Kenyon was 3 â 6,
7 â 5, 6 â 2. In the last two sets' the -winners
resorted to lobbing, which Is the most ef
fective game against Collier and Crowell.
Smith and Smith met MacGavin and Par
ker on even terms and won in straight
sets, 6â3. 6â2.
In the finals the Smith brothers were op
posed to Beal and Kenyon. The handicap
allowed the latter was "half thirty," but
to make the match even Smith and Smith
changed it to "thirty." This handicap
proved too small, as the Smith brothers
won easily. 6 â 1. 6 â 3. In the first set the
losers tried a lobbing frame on their op
ponents, but the hartf-hitting brothers
killed everything in sight.
The match between George Whitney and
Chet Smith for final honors in the Christ
mas tournament went to the former in
straight sets. Smith received odds of
"half thirty." but Whitney was much too
strong for him and won 6â2, 6â3. Thus
for the second time Whitney won the sil
ver cup.
In the morning a fast doubles match
was played between Joseph S. Tobin and
George F. Whitney and Collier and Crow
ell. The former won in straight sets, 6â4,
6â3, 6â4. Tobin is fast regaining his old
form. On New Year's day there will be a
straight handicap singles tournament for
members of the California Club. Four
prizes are offered. Play will begin at 10
a. m.

HAS BECOME POPULAR AT RECREATION PARK WITH THE FOLLOWERS OF THE GAME, TOGETHER
WITH SOME SLY DIGS OF THE CARICATURIST AT WELL-KNOWN PLAYERS. . ' .
CRACK BATSMEN TOY WITH WHALEN,
SCORING SEVEN RUNS IN ONE INNING
The Pitcher for the Wasps- Then Settles Down, but Too Late to
Save the G^me for His Team-- Waddell Str kes Out Nine Men
and Allows but One Hit, Off His Dehvery in Nine Innings
FOR a time at Recreation Baseball
Park yesterday it seemed to the
fevered imagination of the specta
tors that the nine members of the
All-Americas team-were all chas
ing one another around the bases at one
time after the manner of the "turns" at a
"continuous" performance.
It was caused by the Kasterners- falling
on "Jimmy" Whalen's delivery and
pounding it over the lot. when they tired
of this Sullivan sent the ball over the
fence. When the revised list of casualties
was given out by Scorer Harry Cashman
It showed two singles,, a double, a triple
and a home run. Had it been possible to
make a. longer hit the All-Americas would
undoubtedly have been there with the
"goods."
Seven men in all scored during the fusil
lade. At one time three men-were making
a circuit of the bases while the members
of the home team were trying to return
Irwin's three-bagger from deep center.
The All-Americas won finally by a score
of 8 to 2.
In the first inning Pickering, the first
man up, lined out a two-bagger. Barrett
was safe on Whalen's error. Mercer
forced Barrett at second, Pickering scor
ing. Lajoie was safe on a fumble and
stole second. Mercer scored while the
fielders were trying to catch Lajoie be
tween first and sprnnd. T.ninio sonrod Â«n
AUSTRALIA AND HERODOT ARRIVE
FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF WORLD
Big Steamships the Only Important Sunday Arrivals in the Bay.
Japanese Quartermaster on the America Maru Is Arrested for
Smugglingâ Missing Man Traced to Insane Asylum by Stepson
THE Kosmos line steamship Hero
dot, Captain Brandenburg, .ar
rived yesterday after a passage of
106 days from Hamburg, which
port was left on September 24.
During the trip twenty-four stops were
made. The Herodot brought 1786 tons of
cargo for this port, four sacks of mail
and the following named passengers:
Ernst Gabler, Valparaiso; Antonio Pele
grini, San Jose de Guatemala; Walther
Schmidt, Adelina Schmidt, Max Emanuel
Schmidt, Walther Theodor Schmidt and
Paul Kuhn, Callao.
The Herodot was passing into the har
bor of Champerico as the Pacific Mall
steamer San Bias was passing out. Tho
vessels exchanged signals, and the next
day the news was brought to Champerico
of the loss of the San Bias five miles from
La Libertad. When the Herodot left
Chamberico only the most meager reports
of the disaster had been received. The
voyage of the Herodot was otherwise un
eventful.
Australia Arrives From Tahiti.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
steamer Australia, Captain Lawless, ar
rived at 8 o'clock last evening from Ta
hiti, too late to pass quarantine. The
voyage, â¢ which was uneventful, occupied
fourteen days, heavy head winds having
been encountered throughout the .trip.
The Australia brings four passengers in
the cabin, four second-class and eleven in
the steerage.
Sailor Escapes From Ship.
One of the sailors of the British ship
Scottish Isles, which Is about ready for
sea, escaped from the vessel yesterday in
a peculiar manner. The Scottish Isles was
in the stream loading grain from a
schooner alongside. The sailor, whose
name was unknown to the captain,
jumped on the schooner. When the load
of grain was transferred to the ship a
search was mada for him, but he could
not be found.
Traced the Missing Man.
Nell Brierson, 1641 Lombard street,
called at the Harbor Emergency Hospital
yesterday making inquiries for his step
father, Patrick Kehoe, who was held for
observation at the hospital on November
11. Brierson traced him from there to the
Central Emergency Hospital and then to
the City and County Hospital, where he
lost track of him. Steward Kahn, after
ascertaining that Kehoe lived on Beale
street, near Harrison, succeeded In locat
ing the missing man. After Kehoe had
been sent to the City*and County Hospital
he was returned to the insanity detention
hospital. for examination, and .was con-
Davis' single. Bradley singled. Irwin fol
lowed with a three-bagger, scoring Davis
and Bradley. Sullivan's home run scored
Irwin. YVaddell was out at first and Pick
ering, who had two turns at bat, flew out.
Bradley scored the last run for his team
in the fifth. He singled, went to third on
Irwin' s hit to '.'Josh" Reilly, which the
latter muffed, and score'd on Sullivan's
out at first.
The members of the home team made
their two runs in the sixth. Reilly struck
out and Waddell passed Whalen to first,
apparently on purpose, as he let down
noticeably In his pitching for the moment.
Nordyke followed with a two-bagger to
the left-field fence. Wilson singled, scor
ing Whalen. Hlldebrand flew to deep left
and Nordyke scored on the throw in. Wil
son retired the side by being caught steal
ing second.
The local batters could do nothing with
Waddell's delivery. The man who will
pitch for ( ) next year struck out
nine men and allowed only one safe hit.
Whalen settled dowri after the first inn
ing. The six scattering hits of the visitors
netted them only one run.

FESTAL ROSES
ADORN A TOWN
Pretty Pasadena Ready
for the Winter
Carnival.
Brilliant Parade Promised and
Football Men Will
Compete.-
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29.â Pasadena is
taking on a gala appearance in honor of
the annual tournament of roses, which
will occur on Wednesday, January 1. The
main thoroughfares along the line of the
carnival parade, a distance of two miles,
are gay with the official tournament col
ors, yellow and blue, -and garlands of
roses. The national colors and beautiful
green palms are also seen on every hand,
some of the houses being richly dressed
for the occasion. It is confidently expect
ed that the festival on New Year's day
will eclipse all former efforts In the same
direction.
The residents .of Pasadena have taken
great interest in the affair, and many
surprises are looked for In the way of
decorated vehicles, for many of those who
have entered their names on the official
order of parade have not disclosed the na
ture of their vehicles or the manner of
decoration.
One of the features will be a band of
thirty mounted vaqueroa, dressed In bril
liant Mexican costumes and selected with
particular reference to their horseman
ship. The Indian section is also expected
to attract much attention. Grand stands
have been erected all along the line of
parade. At the corner of California and
Orange streets^ will be the main grand
stand, and confetti will be used there.
There has been much rivalry among con
testants for honors in the decorated vehi
cle classes to secure carnations, which
seem to be the favorite flowers desired
this winter for decorative purposes.
â  The parade will start at 10 a. m. and
will be over by noon. Great preparations
are being made by church and other or
ganizations for the feeding of the multi
tudes that are expected to attend. Fifty
thousand visitors are looked for at Pasa
dena on New Year's day.
In the afternoon the great football game
between Stanford University and the Uni
versity of Michigan teams Is scheduled to
begin at 2 o'clock. Carnival Manager
Wagner expects a crowd of from 8300 to
10,000 at the game. Both teams have been
on the ground several days and are put
through the hardest sort of practice work
twice a day. There Is no question of their
good physical condition, and a hard
fought contest Is sure to result when the
Middle West meets the West on Wednes
day.
Eiotous Demonstrations in Naples
NAPLES, Dec. 29.â The arrival here of
the Socialist member of the Chamber of
Deputies, Signor Ferry, to address a meet
ing, resulted in turbulent demonstrations,
which ,the troops were called out to sup
press. Wholesale arrests were made.

PUBLIC FEARS
THE NEW EVIL
Mad Career of the Au
tomobile Terrifies
. Community.
Pedestrians on the Crowded
Thoroughfares in Con
stant Danger.
Up and down the streets of San Frar^
cisco the automobiles are sizzling, Â«>^s
steaming, and one new terror of T&r^H
motion has been added to the traffic tÂ©J
gines that force a couple of eyes to do"*
straight and curve stunts for the protec
tion of the body. Speeding along at
break-neck speed these "loco" or "auto"
affairs â  have terrified a section of tha
community and much profanity has been
produced In the throats of a peaceful
body of men who sometimes cross a,
street.
At Powell and Ellis streets yesterday
afternoon people stood gaping and awe
stricken as one of these steam-emitting;
terrors drove pedestrians off the thor
oughfares. There was many a scare and.
the police were called to stop the wild
career or" automobile a%i automobilist.
The auto or loco mobiltats have camped
upon the town with their fear-engender
ing machines. Swelled in numbers, they
riae here and there and everywhere with
out a. regard to limitations of speed.
Only those men who have been knocked
down -by a bicycle can imagine the pe
culiar pleasures that come trom an au
tomobile accident. There Is an exquisite
and highly refined grinding which makes
it impossible to decipher the suffering
unfortunate from the pavement which
gave the purchase to the machine in its
devastating efforts.
Out of the world the bicycle crank
must go. All that is left for him is to ,
ride behind buggies and poke raillery at '
the drivers of fast horses or terrify anw
mals. The automobilist has a wider
scope.
Judging from the way he runs down
cable cars and puts the electric traction
instruments to shame his havoc will em
brace a broader field. Look, out for him
when he comes down the asphalt. He
ls> a proud creature and knows no bend
ing or one bell. Acceleration of speed i3
his watchword. The man who can run
his machine the fastest is the hero of
to-day. Among h!s friends â automobilista
âhe will be crowned. The more horses he
frightens, the more people he terrifies or
runs down, the more destruction fte
leaves in his wake, the greater will bo
his glory.

Police Capture the Gang in
% a Midnight Raid on the

â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 29. |
After stealing S3000 worth of copper
wire, copper cable, aluminum wire and
ether valuable electrical material from
the Standard Electric Company's works
a.t the foot of Castro street, a gang of
ioung bay pirates was rounded up anj
Jodged in the City Prison early this morn
ing by Policemen John Sherry and AVil
liam Moore.
The thieves are John Audet. 16 years
old, residing at 7b2 Brush street; George
Wittusen. Is years old, whose home is at
fclU Market street, and 'Wesley Bates, IS
years old, living at 614 Sixth street.
Also under arrest is Willie Wittusen. a
brother to George, who, the police declare,
had knowledge of the raids of the trio.
The youths were captured at the roar
of the works, where tney had more than
?100o worth of cable and wire hauled out
of the store houses ready to be cached.
It was the second raid that had been
made upon the works within two weeks.
The pang' invaded the company'? premi
ses at the first expedition from boats.
They carried off $2iÂ«0 worth of cable and
wire, and sold it 10 junk dealers for a
trifle as compared with the real value of
the plunder. The police were notified of
the raid, and constant watch has been
fc.ept urÂ»oii the grounds for the return of
Arie tlUeve&
!Â» Policeman Sherry was at Castro and
'First streets, in hiding last night, when
a watchman inside the works heard suspi
cious sounds. Policeman Moore was sent
in response to a call, and with Sherry
corralled the young raiders nfter a. chase
over the mud and the wharves along the
water front.
Stacked outside the works were piles of
wire. There was 1000 feet of copper worth
S503L Several hundred feet of copper cable
worth 75 cents a foot, a couple of hun
dred pounds of copper worth 20 cents a
pound, and COO feet of iiluminum wire
were in the aile.
. All of this was recovered, but the lot
stolen two weeks ago and twice th^ size
of last night's pile has probably been lost
to the company. It has been sold and re
sold by the junk men to whom the lads
disposed of jt.
That the young pirates were not electro
cuted during their raids is amazing the
company otricials. The burglars e-j.ieivd
the works by smashing a window in the
"test" 1 room. Here run? a wire that car
ries a current of 120.000 volts, and to touch
which would cause instant death. The
line passes through the room, within a
few feet of the window. The police have
learned that Audet. the smallest lad of
the trio, was hoisted into the room, and
how he escaped the heavily charged wire
DO one knows.
Men at the works declared they would
not have taken the chance in the dark
Xor all of the wire the company owns.
Confessions a-plenty were made to-day
to the police. The lads were only too
anxious to yield under the pressure of the
"sweat box." With the thieves in jail an
effort will now be made to force the junk
rnen who received the -wire and cable to
disgorge. According to the declarations
of the company's men prosecution of the
junk dealers will follow. Charges of bur
glary and grand larceny will be lodged
against the thieves.

TEAM CARRIES
DEATH MESSAGE
Rancher Stricken While
Driving Home on a
Lonely Road.
Falls From Wagon and Driver
less Horses Continue
the Journey.
Oakland Office San Franci*?o Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 29.
The driverless team of Sherman L. -Wil
liams, a rancher on the Decoto road,
three miles south pf Haywards, trotted
into the farm place* last evening, and the
absence of the owner, who had left early
in the morning, aroused the family.
Searching parties were organized to hunt
for the missing man. At midnight his un
conscious form was found on the road
half way between his ranch and Alvarado.
Quickly the farmer was taken to Hay
wards, but he was dead before physicians
could be of assistance.
The supposition is that Williams was
attacked with heart disease and fell off
his v.-agon while he was driving home.
His horses, knowing the road well, con
tinued the journey home, leaving their
owner dying by the roadside.
Careful examination was made of the
body for possible external injuries which
might reveal violence, but nothing was
found to indicate that other than natural
causes produced death.
Williams had been renting and operat
ing the Mohr ranch. He went to Alvarado
with his team yesterday, intending to buy
stock for the farm. He left there early
during the evening and started home.
The arrival of the team without him cre
ated consternation. A dozen men neigh
bors of the missing farmer organized the
party that went on the trail. It was
feared the rancher had met foul play.
There will be an inquest to-morrow.
The deceased rancher left a wife and
three children. He was 35 years old. a
native of Ohio. .
BARN BURNERS
ARE IN PERIL
San Rafael 1 Men Make
Threats Against In-
cendiaries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL. Dec. 29.â Another barn
was burned here to-night. About 8:30
o'clock Patrick Cassidy's property was
discovered on fire, and in a few minutes
the structure was destroyed. Three horses
and a cow were also burned. Cassidy was
severely injured while trying to save the
horses.
The person that started the fire also
gave the family of Constable George Ag
new a considerable scare. As he ran away
from the barn he threw a small quantity
of coal oil on Agnew's front steps. Mrs.
Agnew heard it strike and called to her
husband. On going to the door he dis
covered his neighbor's barn on fire and
gave the alarm.
Several nights ago the Mulcahy barn,
adjoining: Cassidy'e, was burned. : Sus
picion points to two' strangers who have
oeen seen prowling around the back yards
in this city for some time. Last night
they were frightened away from two
barns. The officers are making vigorous
searches for them. Threats of ls r nching

tered designs in blue and gold.
Electrical illumination of the fountain
and the background has been provided.
The members of the company hav<>
taken a keen interest in the plans for

SUDDEN DEATH
BEFALLS HUNTER
While Enjoying an Out
ing James Boyd
Drops Dead.

on the Duck Ponds
. at Alvarado.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1113 Broadway, Dec. 29.
While on a hunting trip to the Alvarado
marshes James Boyd, a merchant resid
ing at 237 Perry street. San Franisco,
dropped dead this morning, his body be
ing found near the Golden Gate Gun
Club's headquarters on the marsh.
The deceased hunter left San Francisco
with- a party of friends yesterday after
noon to enjoy a day's sport among the
marshes on a duck hunting trip. Early
this morning they arose and started for
the "blinds," which were located some
distance from the club headquarters. The
"blinds" were reached by a trail across
a levee which had been erected to protect
the back lands from tide overflow.
Mr. Boyd had been out very early and
had started back to the clubhouse for
breakfast, when he suddenly fell to the
ground. Others in the party missed him
and a search was made. The body was
located at 7 o'clock midway between the
"blinds" and the clubhouse.
The remains were taken to Centerville,
where an inquest will be held. From ex
ternal appearances heart disease waa the
cause of death. It is supposed Air. Boyd
over exerted himself during the trip.
He was one of the oldest native sons in
the State, having been born in San Fran
cisco fifty-five years ago. His relatives
have been notified of his death.

HEAVY RAINFALL
STOPS TRAFFIC
Railroad Lines Tied Up
in Pennsylvania and
Tennessee.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 29.-Inces
sant rains for the past forty-eight hours
throughout Eastern Tennessee threaten to
do more damage to property than the dis
astrous flood of last May, when eight lives
were lost and fully 52,000,000 damage was
done to railroad and farming property.
The Southern Railway has stopped all
trains between this city and Asheville, N.
C, owing to the water-covered and per
haps washed-out tracks between Newport
and Rankin. All through traffic and mail
will be handled over the Norfolk and
Western. It will be impossible for the
Southern to handle the trains east, via
Asheville, until late to-morrow at least
and possibly longer, for rain ia still fall
ing.
The Tennessee River is nearing the
thirty-foot mark at this point, with Indi
cations that it will reach forty feet and do
heavy damage.
LANCASTER, Pa., Dec. 29.â A heavy
rainfall has been continuous in this section
since last evening. All the streams in the
county are swollen greatly beyond their
volume and. Conestoga Creek has over
flowed its banks to an extent unknown in
recent years. The bridge crossing this
stream at Engleslde is threatened with de
struction, and traffic on the Lancaster-
Strasburg Railway, of which the bridge is
a link, has been suspended. The bridge
has begun to move and it is believed will
be washed away. It was erected seventy
five years ago.
High water at the plant of the Lancas
ter Electric Light Company at Rockhill,
on the Conestoga, affected the system and
sections of the city are in darkness to
night. The Susquehanna River ia rising
rapidly. At Safe Harbor, where the Con
estoga empties, the rise in the river is at
the rate of six inches an hour. The tracks
of the Port Deposit and Columbia Rail
road at this point are submerged and
much apprehension is felt for property on
low-lying ground. At Bald Friar, further
down the river, a landslide has occurred,
covering the tracks at Columbia and Ma
rietta. The river has not yet risen suffi
ciently to cause alarm.
PITTSBURG. Dec. 29.â Heavy rains for
thirty-six hours here and at all headwater
points on both rivers has produced a con
dition which will result in what may be
called a flood stage in the Ohio River by
to-morrow, when at least twenty feet is
predicted. Time!y warning by the weather
bureau will be the means of saving much
property and only temporary inconveni
ence is expected by interests along the
river fronts.
At midnight the marks at Davis Island
dam showed 14 feet and the water was
rising at the rate of four-tenths of a foot
an hour. Both the Allegheny and Mo
nongahela are still rising.
HTTMOKOUS LETTER FROM
PITTSBURG BOY IN MANILA
Paints Unique Pen Pictures of the
Country, Crops, People, Cus
toms and Occupations.
Private John C. Krause of the Sixth
Cavalry, now in the Philippines, is a Pitts
burg boy, and he has given this geography
of the islands in a letter home: ; "The isl
ands are a bunch of trouble on the west
ern horizon. They are bounded on the
west by hoodooism and smuggling, on the
north by rocks and destruction, on the
east by typhoons and monsoons, and on
the south by cannibalism and earthquakes.
The climate Is a combination of electrio
charges, especially adapted to 'raising
Cain.' The soil is extraordinarily fertile in
producing large crops of insurrection and
trickery. The inhabitants are very Indus
trious, "the chief occupation being the
making of bolos and knives, and the un
loading of Remington rifles and cartridges.
Their amusements are cock-fighting and
cheating. Their diet consists of boiled
rice, stewed rice, fried rice, and rice. The
Philippine marriage service is very im
pressive, especially the clause wherein a
wife can obtain the privilege of working
as much as her husband desires. Manila,
â¢the largest city. Is situated on beautiful
Manila Bay, a large, land-locked body of
water, full of disease, sharks, and sub
marine boats of Spanish make. The prin
cipal exports of the islands are rice, hemp
and sick soldiers. The most important
Imports are American soldiers, arms, am
munition, beer, and tobacco. Malaria is
so prevalent that on numerous occasions
the islands have been taken with a chill.
Communication has been established/be
tween the numerous islands by substi
tuting mosqultos for carrier pigeons, the
mo-sciuitoea.being much larger and better
able for the journey. The native costume
consists of a flour sack tied around the
waist, and anything under 12 years of age
waits until next vear."
Verein Eintracht Dance.
The Verein Eintracht Christmas festi
val and dance, given last night at 237
Twelfth street, proved most successful.
Several hundred people crowded the hall
and dancing was in progress until a late
hour. During the evening refreshments
were served.

children, whose bitter grier paid a rare
tribute to the memory of their dead
friend.
It was the children that Walter Moros
co in his lifetime revealed himself as hÂ©
was. It was these same children that
took the last look at the dead face ami
it was with children's hands that violets,
moist with children's tears, were gently
placed upon the casket until the narrow
box was transformed into a bed of gor

from the chapel to the hearse through a,
lane of weeping little ones, who strewed
with still more purple blossoms the path .
of the bearers.
Services were held at Fruitvale Congre
gational Chanel, and at 2:30 the little
place of worship was crowded to the
doors. The throng surrounded tfia
building, and for nearly a block Fruitvale ,
avenue was one mass of humanity. Tha
chapel has accommodations for about SOU
people. There were in attendance more
than 2000.
The church was beautifully decorated
with flowers, this part of the work hav
ing been attended to by Mra. Henry
Wetherbee of Fruitvale.
The service was conducted by the Rev.
Henry B. Mowbray. the pastor, who paid,.
a sincere tribute to the dead man's life
and spoke feelingly of the loss sustained,
in his taking off.
Vocal selections were rendered by a.
male quartet under the direction of
Samuel D. Mayer, who also presided at
the organ. The other members of tha
quarte t were Benjamin Clark, J. F.
Fleming and J. R. Jones. At the church
they sang "Rock of Ages," "Go to Tfiy
Rest in Peace" and "Good Night." At
the graveside they sang "Nearer, My
God, to Thee" and "Forever With tho
Lord."

HOLIDAYS CAUSE
LIGHT BUSINESS
Money in Keen Demand
on the London Stock
Exchange,
LONDON, Dec. 29. â With two holidays
during the past week the total business of
the Stock Exchange was comparatively
small, but a cheerful tbne\preva$led.
Money was at times in keen demand,
but most of the large debt due the Bank
of England was renewed. Rates were
slightly lower for first-class paper.
Beyond speculative predictions matters
are resting rather quietly, awaiting the
turn of the ye&r, when it is believed, in
most quarters that the accumulation of
"ash at New York and Paris will induce
'.he Unlfed States and France to go into
Ahe London ,8tock Exchange with a view
to large investments purchases at the
present low :level of prices.
BERLIN, Bhec."29. â The Boerse hfere has
experienced an extremely quiet week, tha
monthly settlement passing smoothly. The
demand for money was the lightest for
years past at a December settlement, the
rates averaging V/i per cent lower than a
year ago. - :.*â -.
The market for fixed interest-bearing
funds continued to improve, the ohiet ac
tivity during the last week being found in
Chinese securities and Spanish 4's. The
latter were active upon orders from Paris.
Transactions in coal and iron shares
were extremely light, but values were
Well maintained until yesterday, when
the market weakened upon reports of the
unfavorable situation in the Coke trade.
Other industrials were firm, and the
shares of some machinery, chemical and
brewing concerns scored fair advances.
The financial reviews claim to see signs
of improvement in the situation. They
say the situation otf the Stock Exchange
is better than it was a year ago, inso
much as the bull engagements have been
liquidated since that tfme_and. securities
are now in stronger hands.
A report of the Hamburg Chamber of
Commerce, which has just been published;
expresses growing concern at American
competition and at the new German tariff
bill.

Third^That each of the repobllc* herd repre
sented be recommended to modify port aria har

and that to assist in securing this result the re
spective countries shall encourage the building
of most modern discharging facilities.
Fourth â That for the . purpose of promoting
commerce and mutual intercourse, a uniform
system of maritime and customs administra
tion nomenclature be adopted which shall des
ignate in alphabetical order in equivalent terms
in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French,
the commodities upon which import duties are
levied, to be used by'aM the American re
publics for the levying of customs imposts
which are or may hereafter be established and
are also to b& used in shipping manifests, con
sular invoices, entries, clearance petitions and
other customs documents, but not t6 affect fn

the Import duties they may now have in force
or which they; may hereafter establish. For

Arbitration Scheme Balked.
A slight difficulty , has arisen in the mat
ter of arbitration. It had been arranged
that all delegations were to adhere to The
Hague convention, and > all nations In
favor of compulsory"., arbitration- were to
sign another treaty among themselves
embodying that principle. The latter
group say that they agreed to this ar
rangement as a compromise, but with the
distinct understanding that both plans
were to be presented to the conference.
Now It seems t'hat the United States
delegates and others who are in favor of
The Hagu& convention ' pure and simple
wish to exclude the compulsory plan- from
the conference, leaving those nations
which are in favor of it to sign It outside
and Independently of the conference. This
the compulsory party will by no' means
agree to, and two or three of them said
this evening that unless both plans are
presented thgy would refuse to sign the
arrangement ,fqr. joinirig The Hague con
vention- .-â *'-' â¢ . -
The func'ticm at the Church of Our Lady
61 Guadalttpe this morning, at which the
]?an-American , delegates were present,
was one of the grandest and most Impos
ing religious . Ceremonies seen in Mexico
for some time. The Archbishop of Mex
ico officiated. â  'â % â ;â¢â .
In the procession the delegates of all
the American nations took part, each car
rying his country's flag. Although Sen
ator Davis and the other members of the
United States delegation were. present and
took part In the procession, the United
States flag was carried in the procession
by General Frlsbie, an old-time American
resident â¢ of Mexico.' â  Afterward, In the
presence of the Archbishop, the flags were
laid in turn on the high altar, General
Triable depositing the American flag.
After the service the Archbishop held an
Informal reception and presented to each
delegate a commemorative silver medal.
QUESTION OF SUNSHINE
' IN OUR VARIOUS CITIES
From the known latitude of a station ft
is possible to calculate the number of
hours that the sun is above its horizon
during a year. The observations at the
various stations of tfte United States
Weather Bureau give the actual number
of sunlit hottrs. A comparison of the two
numbers gives the percentage of sunlit
hours at the station. From the last report
of the bureau (just published) the follow
ing- data are selected:
Albany, N. Y., 55 per cent of sunlit
nourS; Atlanta, Ga., 53 per cent; Atlantic
City, N. J., 58 per cent; Baltimore, Md.,
66 per cent; Boston, Mass., 52 per cent;

claims he was attacked about 6 o'clock by
five men on Third street, between Market
and Mission. He was knocked down and
kicked on the head and face and $2 75
taken out of his pockets. He went to the
Emergency Hospital and had a wound on
his scalp and abrasions and contusions on
his face attended to. The police were then
notified. As Lindgrand drove a team
during the strike it is thought that had
something to do with the attack upon
him.
Shortly before 3 o'clock Policeman Bun
ner saw Charles Sales, a colored youth,
going through the pockets of a man lying
on the sidewalk on the north side of
Washington street, near Kearny. Sales
ran as soon as he observed Bunner, who
gave chase and at Montgomery avenue
and Pacific street Sales ran into the arms
of Policeman Skain. He was taken to the
City Prison and booked on a charge of
attempt to commit grand larceny. The
man he was trying to rob was Michael
Sanford, 732 Washington street, who was
booked on a charge of "drunk."

Edward. Connolly the Victim of an
Unknown Man With a
Knife.
During a general fight in R. Shannon's
saloon, Seventh and Folsom streets, be
tween 2 and 3 o'clock yesterday morning,
Edward Connolly of 1124 Folsom street
was cut with a knife on the back, left
shoulder and left breast. He was taken to
the Receiving Hospital, where his wounds
were stitched and dressed. They are not
dangerous.
Connolly was drinking with William Mc-
Donald of 124 Langton street and another
friend when a row was started and every
man was soon using his fists to the best
advantage. The barkeeper drove them all
out of the saloon and it was then that
Connolly was cut. He says he knows the
man who used the knife on him, but does
not know his name. The police are mak
ing an investigation into the case.

AUTHORS EXPECT TO MAKE A HIT
WITH "THE KNICKERBOCKER DAMES"
Mrs. .Lovell White and Mrs. Ella Sexton Collaborate in Preparing
Satire on Eastern Fad for Unearthing Distinguished Ancestry,
Which Will Be Presented Before ; California Glub by Members
BY SALLY SHARP.
OTHAT all the men who ever
said women had no sense of
humor could be guests of the
California Club on founders' day
and take in the delicious satire
in "The Knickerbocker Dames," a one-act
play, written by two women and intept
preted by ten more^all members of -the
club.
To hear women satirizing themselves
with subtlety and shading that show un
derstanding of their own fair sex is some
thing rare. I stole in at one of their re
hearsals and know whereof I speak.
I predict that there will be an enthusias
tic patting together of white gloves to
morrow afternoon when the play is pre
sented.
The plot for "The Knickerbocker
Dames" was conceived bv Mrs. Lovell
White, president of the California Club,
when she went to Washington last time
with Mrs. A. D. Sharon in the interest of
the bill before Congress for preserving the
Big Trees. At that time that tremendous
ly exclusive orderâ "Daughters of the
Revolution"â was having its annual con
vention in Washington and Mrs. White
looked in. Unfortunately at every ses
sion Mrs. White attended the aristocratic
ladies were having their ultra-aristocratic
feelings hurt in one way or another. For
example: A daughter of some well-known
forefather with a prominent jawbone, but
â without credentials, would have trouble in
making her presence felt because she was
not of a sufficiently prognathic appear
ance to convince certain others of her re
lationship. Those fortunate enough to be
related on the illustrious father's side
were admired and pronounced "lineage"
descendants, while those from the
mother's side of the house were patron
ized and termed "merely collaterals."
Much "weeding out" was attempted at
these sessions for the protection of the
truly eligibles and the result was that
words were spoken feelingly now and
then.
This was Mrs. White's inspiration. Upon
returning to 6an Francisco she communi
cated her plan to Mrs. Ella M. Sexton.
They worked out the situations and Mrs.
Sexton took the writing in hand, turning
out a. clever litle play. Mrs. Sexton also
takes an important part.
"The Knickerbocker Dames" is a soci
ety of aristocratic ladies of New York
whose only purpose is to find out and
perpetuate the valorous deeds of their
forefathers and to trace their own lln-
THIEVES BREAK
A WOMAN'S JAW
Aged Mrs. Foote Is the
Victim of Brutal :
Criminals.
Mrs. N. J. Foote, an aged woman, was
brutally assaulted and robbed by an un
known man and woman in her room in
the Elysium. 566 Geary street, early yes
terday morning.
The thieves secured a valuable pearl
necklace, a gold watch and chain and
$400 in greenbacks. . . . . .
According to the story told' by Mrs.
Foote, who arrived here only a short time
ago from China, she was walking, along'
Market street on Saturday night when
she was accosted by a well dressed young
woman, who engaged her in conversation.
At the solicitation of the stranger, so Mrs.
Foote says, she accompanied ! her to the
Hoffman Cafe at Second and Market
streets, where they had several drinks.
After leaving the cafe the two women
walked up Market street and when near
Lotta fountain Mrs. Foote s companion
called a young man whom she claimed
was her brother. After being Introduced
to Mrs. Foote the man proposed that
they take a hack drive to the Cliff. As
Mrs. Foote had no objection, the trio
hailed a passing hack and ordered the
driver to take them to the park. When
about a block from the park the man
complained about feeling ill, and at the
suggestion of his supposed sister the
driver was ordered to turn back. On the
return trip the trio had several drinks, all
of which were paid for by Mrs. Foote.
Shortly before 2 o'clock in the morning
the trio brought up at the Elysium, and
as the elevator was not running Mrs.
Foote's new found friends consented to
assist her to her apartments. After reach
ing her room, Mrs. Foote says, the man
struck her on the face with his clenched
fist, breaking her jaw. As she fell pros
trate the woman who accompanied her
grabbed her purse containing her green
backs and jewelry. The man and woman
then ran down the stairs and disappeared.
Mrs. Foote's screams attracted the at
tention of one of the employes of the
house, who, upon going to her room,
found her lying on the floor. She was

UNUSUAL NUMBER OF
DRIVEES IN THE PARK
Unsprinkled ' Roads and Clouds of

Pleasure Seekers.
The park and beach attracted an unu
sually large throng yesterday, and al
though the north wind had a 'touch of
snappy cold as it blew down the beach
and across the park, roads, the . drivers,
riders and pedestrians were out in force.
No accident of any kind marred the
pleasure of the crowds of people, but an
act of neglect on the part of the Park
Commissioners brought discomfort to the
drivers and riders. The wind was. light
but the dust was so thick and annoying
that the clothes of- those In buggies and
on horseback were damaged. Women who
usually wear their furs and light-colored
coats when driving, returned from their
outing with discolored robes and sore
hearts, r. A sprinkling of the roads would
have been a prevention of the discomfort
arising from the dust.

WARM TRIBUTE
Solemn Services Held
in Memory of J. J.
Valentine.
Character of Late Eanker
Held Up as Worthy of
Emulation.
The services in memory of the late John
J. Valentine attracted a large audience to
the auditorium of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association yesterday . afternoon.
Among those who attended were many
employes of" Wells, Fargo & Co., all of
whom had known the deceased president
and had learned to love him for his uni
form kindness to those with whom he
came in contact as man and official. On
the platform were seated the officials of
the association, the clergy and others.
' The meeting was opened by Rolla V.
Watt, president of the .association, who
announced the hymn. Prayer was offered
by the Rev. William C- Shaw, rector of
the Church of the Advent, . East Oak
land, of which congregation the deceased
banker was a member. The association
quartet then sang a selection, "Crossing
the Bar." Rev. fi. E. Baker delivered an
address on the subject "Man of Menâ a
Study of Character." He said in part:
The Young Men's Christian Association
stands for the formation of character. It was
because of his Christian training that Mr. Val
entine formed a character which he has left to
us as a priceless legacy. Holmes tells us that
a man is made up of three thingsâ heredity,
education and environment. Mr. Valentine
possessed the qualifications which make men
great. He came from a sturdy stock, and he
inherited those qualities which were afterward
to make him a conspicuous figure in more than
one field. Poverty does not disbar a man from
success, as he proved. The opportunities that
come with wealth did not come to him until
late in life, and until he bade them come. Hii
education was not of the school. The real
education comes not from the college walk cr
from contact with professors. Education comes
from the study of men and affairs; and it was
in these that this man excelled.
And yet, while discharging the duties of a
most responsble position, he found time to
study the problems of life so that he became an
authority upon coinage, currency, Homer and
the translations of Homer. The secret of au
thority In any line is the secret of persistence.
There is only one genius, and that is the
genius of. hard work. In his labor Mr. Valen
tine was indefatigable. It was not by accident
that he was called upon to become the head of
a mighty corporation, but it was because at the
beginning he mastered all the details. The
greatness of this man did not consist. in being
tha head of this corporation, but it was due to
his sturdines of character, his fearlessness of
opinion, hia intellectual honesty which made
him great. He had the courage of his con
victions. His love for humanity was catholic,
and his benefactions were as broad as* they
were numerous. Although a man of great af
fairs, he found time to worship. The life of
such a man is worthy of emulation, and in
closing let me admonish all to pattern their
lives as he did, after the Master's. Then will
come the reward not only here but in the here
after.
Rev. Mr. Shaw spoke a brief eulogy of
the deceased, whom he had known inti
mately for some years as his pastor. The
speaker said Valentine was a Christian,
who did good because he loved goodness,
and that in his death humanity suffered
a distinct loss.
Remarks were made by President Watt
and Secretary McCoy of the association,
both of whom referred to * Valentine's
work in behalf of the association and of
his warm attachment for the young men.
The service closed with benediction by the
Rev. Mr. Baker.
Valentine Memorial Services.
OAKLAND, Dec. 29.â High tribute was
paid to-day to the memory of the late
John J. Valentine, president of Wells,
Fargo & Co.. by the parishioners of the
Church of the Advent, of which Mr. Val
entine had been an active and prominent
member. Special services were held this
morning. The Rev. William Carson Shaw,
the rector, preached a memorial sermon,
and music appropriate to the service was
sung by the vested choir. The solo for
the offertory was "Lead Us and Guide
Us," sung by J. E. Dean.
CONSOLIDATION SHOWS
SUCCESS IN CHABITY
Eureka Benevolent Association and
Hebrew Board of Relief Dem- '
onstrate Good Work.
Members of the Eureka Benevolent As
sociation met at the office on O'Farrell
street yesterday to hear the fifty-first an
nual report and also to elect officers for
the year. Charles Hirsch, the president,
announced that the year had been made
memorable by the fact of the unification
of the disbursing boards or charity .com
mittees of the four leading Jewish relief
organizations of the city, an object that
had for many years failed of accomplish
ment.' The charity committee composed
of delegates from several benevolent or
ganizations was now known as "The He
brew. Board of Relief," with full charge
of all matters pertaining to relief work.
The report showed that the expenditures
from .the general fund had been consid
erably less this year than for the previous
one. As a result of the consolidation of
the charitable organizations they had re
duced the expenditures during the past
year to $20,486 95. which was $2237 52 less
than the previous one. The total sum ex
pended in charity was $16,701 86. "The total
expenditure for the year amounted to
$20,486 93. Last year's deficit was $9248 40.
while this year it was considerably less,
being only $2924 04, which result was due
principally to the work of the- committee
on subscriptions, which, under the chair
manship of Lewis ' Gerstle, succeeded in
augmenting the income with . the sum of
$4555 25. The widow and orphan fund had a
capital of $140,026 54, a gain of $1898 27. The
expenditures for* dispensations to widows
were ?4582 50 and proportion of expenses
$137914. . : ' " .
A. retrospective glance into the fifty
one years' history of the association
showed the duties performed and the ben
efits conferred. It had fed the hungry
and clothed and sheltered the homeless,
and while alleviating poverty had neither
encouraged pauperism nor destroyed the
self-respect of the beneficiaries.
The following named officers were
elected;
President, Charles Hirsch; â¢ vice presi
dent. S. . W. Heller; treasurer, Albert
