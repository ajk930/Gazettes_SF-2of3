Specia! Correspondent of The Ca I
MEMPHIS, Tenn.. April 3O.-Tte
second day's run of the Presl-
Jential train was through a
region less attractive than the
picturesque mountain scenery
of yesterday. The â¢weather was
â¢ extremely warm and the track
tlusty. The spring season In the South
has been several weeks delayed as In the
North, but the warm weather of the last
two days has brought out the trees In
full leaf.
Most of the party retired last night at the
Tennessee-Alabama line. The picturesque
region about Lookout Mountain . was
l>assed at dawn and a few arose to see it
from the observation car. but, the Presl- ;
dent and Mrs. McKinley did not arise un
til near breakfast time. The first stop of
the day was made at Huntsville, Ala.
Toward noon the weather was uncomfort
ably warm, and iced drinks were much in j
demand.
The ladies seemed more interested â¢ in
preserving their flowers than In attending
to their own physical comfort. The' rear
.pratfonn was baiiked with them and many
~~*uia&s6fp& 'wrr^-Alr-d :n tbV-ao&n
. At one stop a fasr-fcjured. .Wu'Â«-eyed
miss, with- roee-red lips half partÂ£i in a
emll*. roguishly stepped forward, and
plucked a bud from, the car. - .The Presi T
dent gallantly- rowed and smiled, whereat
the~audaclous miss coquettishly kissed
her dainty finger tips.
. _ A funny looking little negro girl, dressed
In homespun anc. wearing a headgear of
red bandana, tried to emulate the example
of her fair tister. She smirked and
"eourtesied" until her linsey woolsey
Fklrts brushed the ground. This raised a
good laugh and a Cabinet officer remarked
poto voce to an associate, "The President
ls= almost as popular as Hobson."
At some of the brief stops, however,
there were, only a few cheers given by the
awe-stricken natives. There was no lack
of warm hospitality shown at any point,
, but many of the simple people teemed
rendered speechless from sheer fright, and
they could only gaep a wide-eyed open
mouthed appreciation of the President's
visit. Never before had they been so near
to greatness and perhaps would never be
sgaln.
Noisy Welcomes.
The larger towns, however, gave the
noisiest welcomes and some of the villag
ers, in their enthusiasm, tried to climb up
Into the vestibuled platforms. At one
place a well-meaning, but ill-advised citi
zen swung his hat and called to his neigh
bors in a lusty voice. "Three cheers for
the liberator of the white Republican in
the South, William McKinley." He was
proceeding to make a set speech, but he
was not heard. His peroration was
drowned in laughter. Some times in dis
tant cotton fields were noticed negroes,
shouldering hoes and drawn up in'military
line as the train sped by. They wore
"strawpiles" turned tp at the back and
down at the front. Hk3 the hayseed bon
r.ets of Filipino troops/
As a diversion the men of the party
sought newspapers, books, cards and the
smokir.g-room, while the ladles read,
played whist or indulged In naps. Thus
passed many pleasant hours as the tiain
sped through the South. The Cabinet
Secretary strolled occasionally from one
"end of the long vestibuled train .to the
other, but the President for the-most part
remained steadily In his own
ment and in his favorite seat; except
when he was called out to address a
crowd assembled at some . station.
McKinley Always Gracious.
Some of the towns were passed without
so much as the toot of a whistle,*? but
when an aggregation of rustics was lined
up at the depot of some little town the"
President would bow and smile his ap
preciation and the ladles would wave
their handkerchiefs as the train tiltied by.
Occasionally a Cabinet secretary wauid
etroll Into the PreFidenfs car for a chat.
The subject that seemed most to Interest
the President was the decadence it the
Southern country and its promised regen
eration.
As the train speeded along there, were
noticed from the car windows many half
deserted village*, with only a few dilap
idated weatherboard houses or log cabins.
Idle mills and vacant stores. The people
in this section, content to take life easily;
had nought to do but gather at the sta- ;
tion to see the trains go by. Negroes al
ways predominated, and for the most pait
nog.rr, "nammys" with pickaninnies
clinging to their skirts.
It was remarked by the President and
his Cabinet secretaries that; though the
'South, with Its Eunny fields, flowery mca-

Old South and the New.
These were the thoughts that evidently
occupied the President's, mind as he sat
pensively gazing from his car window
drumming idly upon its pane". - Now and
then he would comment on the beauty of
some bit of passing- landscapeâ the view
of a. river, forest, mountain or valley, but
irresistibly would he return to a discus
sion of the subject nearest his heartâ the
old South and the new. .
A close personal friend who talked Â¦with
him to-day said to-night: "To build up
the Republican paity in the \ South is
-doubtless his ambition, yet no one who
heard him speak -to-day could, doubt his
sincere friendship for the whole people

TWO ADDRESSES
IN MISSISSIPPI
People at Decatur and Tus
eumbia Cheer Party and
Crowd Around the Train
CORINTH, Miss., April 30.â Between
Decatur and Tuscumbia the Presidential
train was stopped to permit the party to
be photographed. The operators at Deca
tur and Tuscumbla had not been notified
of the intended stop and when the train
did not appear at Tuscumbla on schedule
time the operator there flashed the news
along the line, "President's train lost."
The report even reached the home office
in Washington. For several minutes the
wires flashed messages back and forth
as the officials were becoming alarmed
over the whereabouts of the President.
Finally the train appeared at Tuscumbia
and the operator reported It safe.
At Decatur President McKinley said:
The attention of the people of the South and
the warmth of their welcome have been t>o
constant since we started from the Â¦ Capital
City yesterday morning that words seem poor
Indeed to express our gratitude and apprecia
tion. We. have no North, no South, no East,
no West but are all Americans. No Solid
South and no solid North, save when solid
for the flag and the Union. I have been glad
to note as I traveled through this section of
our beloved country the- great progress and
prosperity everywhere : evidenced. This country
has been signally blessed. We have everything.
God has oeen good to us. He has given to
us a heritage which awaits our development,
which we must not neglect, and it is our duty
to preserve this to liberty forever and forever.
I am sure you will be very, glad to meet
the Secretary of State "and other members of
the Cabinet.* who are accompanying me on thl3
Journey, and . I have the . pleasure of present-
Ing to you Mr. Hay, whree name has been eo
conspicuously associated with the open door in
China for your products. \
In Tuscumbia.
! One of the pretty incidents of the stop
at Decatur was the. presentation on be
half; of ahe ladies of Decatur; of a :oving
cup and a basket of trout to Mrs. Mc-
Klnley by Andrew and Miss Mary Frye,
two 'of her old .school friends at Canton.
Colonel R. H. Adams, as the personal rep
resentative of Governor Sam Ford, who is
ill, boarded the train here to? escort the
President to the Mississippi State line.
At Tuscumbla the crowd about the Pres
ident's . car was so dense that, by Mr.
McKInley's direction, several of the chil
dren-who were in danger of being crushed
were lifted over the rail to the platform.
Many of the old Confederate veterans
fought for the honor of grasping the Pres
ident's hand.
Â¦ 'As : the President ' was * about " to ' begin
his remarks there were cries of "Put the
flags down," referring to the flags held by
children who were near. the car, at which
the President exclaimed: "Never lower
that nag." . -
When the cheering had subsided he said:'
My Fellow Citizens: I wish I had words In
which to express the feflings of my heart for
this more than kindly welcome on the part of
the people of this city. In all our traveling
through the South we have been showered with
kindness, and we have been madÂ« to feel every
hour of the day that, If there ever was any
doubt in- the past there is no doubt row that
we are one people, one In hope. In sentiment,
in purpose and undying devotion to our coun
try and Its standard, and the Government rests
upon the people, for they are sovereign. " -We
are your agents. The President and the Con
gress are but the representatives of the public
will, and so long as , the people are united, so
long as their homes are virtuous, so long as
the public schools of our country Â¦ continue .to
educate the children In tbe paths of patriotism
and loyalty ' and Intelligence* and morality, bo
lorn? will this great Government rest securely
and advance '. triumphantly to its highest des
tiny. (Great applause.) ~ . ,
The President then* Introduced 'Secre
tary "Wilson, who Â¦ bpoke ; of the agricul
tural progress of the State. He aroused
great enthusiasm when he spoke of the
fact that two years ago,' when the cot
ton crop was short and ; was Â¦ worth ; mil-"
liena,- the, people'of the South wanted to
know It,' and the administration notified
of this number nearly seventy will be
guests of honor.

Thank Gofl no sectionalism now mars the map
of the United States. Our opinions upon public
questions of national interest and national wel
fare fio not rest upon the color of the uni
forms we wore In 1861, but upon our construc
tions of right and duty in 190L And I rejoice
to-night to say in this presence that the happy
time bas come and that:
"The North and the South together brought,
Xow o-wn the same electric thought.
In peace a common flag salute,
And with free and uwesentful rivalry
Harvest the fields whereon they fought."
So we have our railroads to the Pacific, and
now we are reaching out for more trade, and
for a period of years you have been shipping
your cotton to China. This bas been Inter
rupted a little in the last few months, but that
interruption we trust will be speedily removed
and we will have the open door to China, on
equal terms with every power on earth. And
it Is not going to hurt this trade that we "have

The President paid a tribute to the
efficiency of "General Luke Wright of
Memphis, one of the Philippine Commis
sioners, and continued:
Building of the Roads.
The Government of the United States as
eisted in the building of the roads. It guaran
teed away back in the sixties $04,000,000 of the
Pacific Railroad bonds and became responsible
for their payment, and took a second mort
gage upon the property as security to the
Government- (Applause.) It is Interesting to
note In this presence that within the last four
years, of that debt, reaching- $130,000,000, prin
cipal and interest belonging to the Govern
ment of the United States. S124.000.000 has been
paid into the public Tra&sury and the balance
secured, thus giving us not only the principal
of the aid we gave these roads, but Interest at
more than 3 per cent.
resolution instructed its Senators and members
in the Congress of the United States to vote
for a great transcontinental line to the Pacific
Coast to be aided by the Government of the
United States. - . "
Three years afterward the Legislature then
assembled, not approving of the suggested route
to the Pacific Coast, .suggested that all of the
plans ehould firtt be laid before Congress be
before action was taken, and that the route
that would do the moet good for all the Inter
ests of the people should be the one that ought
to be adopted. (Applause.) â¢ Â¦
That was the purpose; that was the spirit of
the people of Tennessee fifty years ago. Xo
question as to whether it was to be the central
line or the pouthern line or northern line. The
real Question was the connection of this
great South and North of ours with the Pa
cific Ocean, thus leading out to the great mar
kets in the Orient. 'What your Legislature: a
half century ago resolved ehould be done has
already been accomplished. We not only have
one. but we have five lines connecting the
Atlantic with the Pacific â the Union Pacific,
the Southern, the Atchison, the Great North
ern and Northern Pacific â making- five great
transcontinental lines connecting the two
oceans. (Applause.)

Unless something is speedily done the samÂ«

hands of the carpenters and the work will
be rapidly pushed to completion. This
skeleton is made" of wood and wire screen,
thirty feet in height and ninety feet in
circumference. In- shape it is- the hand
bouquet of the present time enlarged to
enormous proportions. The base is a tele
graph polo nrmly imbedded deep in .the
earth. Eight feet from, the ground the cir
cular structure for the flowers begins.
This will be first covered with canvas
and . then ' with fence wire screen. The
flowers will be set in the screen with the
stems resting against the canvas and a
spray of water inside the globe will keep
the canvas damp and the blossoms fresh.
The county Is being scoured by the bot

and snake charmers will hold forth on the
large lot ' belonging to the county beside
the courthouse. A basket-ball game be
tween the 'girls of the normal school and
some outside the city team is being talked
of and ; would prove a drawing: card for
many. The battle of flowers and the pa

REDDING, April" 30.â The Immense
smelting plant of the Mountain Copper
Company at Keswick is to be operated
wholly in the near future with electrical
power. General Manager Lewis T.
Wright of the mining company is said to
have signed with the president of Kes
v-ick Electric Power Company (H. H.
Xoble of San Francisco) for enough
power to conduct the entire plant. It Is
believed that 1500-horsepower will be ne
cessary, although no definite amount
is named in the agreement. The "K*Â»swick
Electric Power Company is" installing a
power plant on Mill Seat Creek, in the
Shlngletown region, about forty miles
southeast of Redding. With the machin
ery now being taken in 6000-horsepower
can be produced. Besides the Mountain
Copper Company it is hoped to supply
not only the other big mines of the coun
ty with electrical power and light, but
the cities of Redding. Red Bluff, Cotton
wood and Anderson as well.

SAX JOSE, April 30.â San Jose Is now in
a position to compete with other cities in
a manufacturing line, having almost an
unlimited supply of electrical power at
its command. This advantage was aug
mented last night, when the Standard
Klectricai Company sent a current of
60,000 volts over Its lines from Blue Lakes
to this city, a distance of 1S4 miles, beat
ing the world's record for long-distance
transmission of electricity. This feat,
which -was merely to test the wires, was
successful, and in a few days, power will
be supplied to. this city for manufacturing
purposes. â./">-Â¦ -
Shortly after 8 o'clock the current was
turned into the bay counties circuit at the
big power house on the Mokelumne Kiver,
in Amador County, and a moment later
lights in the stations at Oakland and here
responded to the magic current. The cur
rent was sent to Oakland and from there
to this city by way of Mission San Jose.
As soon as rights of way can be procured
and lines constructed the power will be
taken to San Francisco, thus making a
circuit of more than 235 miles. The next
best record to this in transmitting elec
tricity over a distance is in Southern Cali
fornia, where the power used at Redlands
is carried eighty-three miles.
The power of the Standard Electric
Company in this vicinity will be handled
by the Blectric Improvement Company.
At the latter's plant near the narrow
gauge railroad an immense sub-station
has been erected at a cost of JMW.000. In
ane room are three immense transform
ers, where the i_ressure is reduced .from
00,000 volts to 22,500 or 4000, as desired.
Some $70,000 has been expended on storage
batteries, which are capable of giving out
.several hundred horsepower for twenty
four hours if for any reason the current
should be shut oft". The Electric Improve
ment Company also has a 700-horsepower
engine, which will also be held in reserve
in case of accident.
The people of San Jose are highly elated
ever the turning on of the power, and It
is now believed several factories will be
located here, which,' owing- to lack of
power, have not come heretofore.

had absconded. It is not known â¢ how

is said he is making his way to Australia.
McDor-ell, before leaving town, com

He said that himself alone had handled
the funds of the order for the last five

officials predict a continuance of the rain
to-night - and possibly to-morrow. Â¦ The
precipitation at this time will do a great
deal of good, although considerable hay
now down will suffer if the cloudy weath

Almost all- other crops will be greatly

date last season. The storm will do an
immense amount of good to the hay and
grain. There will be slight damage to
some alfalfa hay, which has been cut.
Cherries .will not be hurt to any serious
extent.' Berry, picking will be put back
for a few days. The storm was general
throughout the Sacramento Valley and

fall of rain at Placerville amounted, to 2.40
inches. At Delta, at the head of the val
ley, the fall was 1.50 inches. In the moun

_^^ ceived copious showers of rain
since last Sunday noon. Along
the crest of the Sierras there has been
quite a lodgment of fresh snow, which
â¢will tend to replenish the streams of the

The rains, extending over a vast area,

the regions north of the Russian River

products will be multiplied.
The most gratifying intelligence regard
ing the benefits of the general rain was
received yesterday at the offices of the
Southern Pacific Railroad. The amplitude
of the rainfall causes special rejoicing.
April showers were hoped for to help
along the pasture and give the grain fresh
impulse, but a soaking rain of forty-eight
hours was a greater blessing than was
expected. It is admitted that the hay al
ready cut will be slightly damaged, but
the damage in this respect will prove a
mere trifle in comparison with the large
measure of benefit which must accrue. to

Sheriff Langford Confident.
Sheriff Langford Is confident Crill is no
other than i Dunham. Â¦ He points to the
tallying descriptions and to the confession
made to E. C. Greiner.
"Crill proved a' willing prisoner," said
Langford. "When we searched ' him he
had a bottle of morphine in his posses
sion, which goes to show he was prepared
to carry out the threat made in his con
fession to Greiner.
"Besides his hair end mustache were
dyed. Therfe was nothing to do but to
bring him back. Others say he is a double
Jim Dunham, but I think I have the right
man. Anyhow, if he is innocent he can
prove his identity. Crill is a hard drinker
and this accounts for some little change
from the description of Dunham."
that he was ashamed of, except to drink
and dissipate. According to Crill he was
married to Dora Schreiber in Cripple
Creek about the year 1887, and has .one
child â a boy 10 or 11 years old. As proof
of this he exhibits a letter from the child
addressed to "Dear Papa" and signed
"Joseph F. Crill." The letter is dated
April 6, and, after mentioning his Christ
mas gifts, the child describes the poor
financial condition of his mother.
' v. Has a "Wife in Colorado.
This letter is all the documentary evi
dence that Crill offers as to his identity.
Crill says his wife resides in Cripple
Creek, at 223 North Second street. For
the past three years, he says, he has
been organizing magazine clubs through
out the country, but he gives no definite
knowledge of his whereabouts since the
commission of the Dunham munlors. i He
was in New Mexico and Mexico, and
claims to have received the scar on the
Dack of his head in a fight In New Mex
ico with Mexicans, south of Trinidad.
As references as to his identity he gives
the names of Will Lang, a printer and
lithographer of Pueblo; a man named Mc-
Coy, who was formerly clerk of court
at Pueblo, who is now believed to be in

formation on which the arrest was made,
served a number of years as Marshal of
Burlington, Iowa. He accompanied .Sher
iff Langford and will put in a claim for*
the $10,000 reward. He said to-night:
Will Claim the Reward.
"A couple of years ago I arrested a
Dunham suspect at Burlington. His de
scription tallied well with the circulars
and I thought I had the right man. A
young fellow named Parr, who resided at
Campbell and knew Dunham, was in the
East, at the time, and the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County had Parr called in
to see him at the jail.
"The man was. not Dunham, but from
Parr 1 gained the most minute details and
description of the murderer, and when my
term expired I resolved to try to find Dun-,
ham. As to whether he is the man I will
leave that to you folks to judge and iden
tify him."
, Descriptions Tally Perfectly.
The following descriptions of Dunham
and Crill show how nearly, identical are
their features: .

shal of Burlington, had Dunham under
surveillance at Wichita. Kans.. and ask

was in the country.

That night Crill returned to Wichita

Langford and Deputy Bache spirited their
man away to Newton, thirty miles from
Wichita, where they kept him a prisoner
in a room from Thursday morning to Sat
urday night. Crill waived the reading of
the extradition papers and agreed to ac
company Sheriff Langford to this State.
He stipulated that if he was not the right
man he should get his expenses and a re
turn ticket. - '.
On Saturday night a start was made for

Crill was at once taken to the County
Jail. People who knew Dunham were
called in to identify him. In a short time
the bui'dins was full of people. H. L.
Miller, â¢who perhaps knew Dunham bet
ter than any other man, was positive the
right man had been arrested. Deputy
Sheriff Marcene was also positive it was
Dunham. Deputy Sheriff Bache had been
intimately acquainted with Dunham, and
he declared they had brought the right

Sustwct Tells His Story.
Crill put on a bold front and, while he
was evidently nervous, he hid his feel
ings admirably. .He stood in various po
sitions, got down and turned around
so the light would shine upon . him for
those who came to identify him.
Surrounded by a group of newspaper
men Crill, or Dunham, talked freely. He
denied point blank that he was Dunham
or had ever been in California before. He
said: - ... 'Â¦ -v.fr
"I am not James C. Dunham, the mur
derer. I was never here and never left
here to avoid arrest. In 1S96, at the time
of the Dunham murders, I. was in Lead
ville, Colorado. I fixed the date by the
great Leadi-ille strike.' which, "- 1 think,
started on June 14, 1S96. For two years
from that time I was either in Pueblo or
Cripple Creek.
"Do you suppose if I were Dunham that
I would have come back here - with the
Sheriff without making a legal fight? Not
much! If I had committed the crime I
would have been afraid to come â would
fear I might be lynched by the people.
No. sir; I am not Dunham, and will have
little trouble in proving my identity.
Has Been a Wanderer.
"I was born m Rome, N. Y., in 1860. My
father and mother are both dead. I. have
a brother, E. J. Crill, who is now some
where in Arkansas. Owing to trouble in
settling my father's estate, of which I
received nothing, we do not correspond.
At the ago of IS I left home at Rome,
N. Y-, and went to live with an uncle at
Flag Station, Illinois. My uncle's name
is David R. Crill. I do not know whether
he is dead or alive. I stayed there that
winter and then went to Rockford, Illi
nois. . -- ".'-:
"I worked there several* years for J. A.
Shondy & Sons, soap- manufacturers, and
then went back to New York, stayed
there a short time and came West. I do
not know just where I ha\ r e been. I was
in Colorado for ten or twelve years. Plave
not seen one of my relatives in all those
years, except a cousin, Howard Crill,
whom 1 saw in Salt Laake several years
ago. My relatives were all cattle and
horse men, and as I disliked farming I cut
loose from them. My cousin has a cattle
ranch in Iowa."
Crill said he had never done anything
cess to force it open. Not succeeding, ha
called, "Come out, Mac. Come out, I want
to see you." The"re was no reply. He
called again, "Come out, Mac, I am bound
to have you anyhow. Conrse out. Bob"
(meaning Brisco, who had been asleep in
the shanty) "I want; you, too. And you,
too, Schaible."
McGlincy responded: "I Â¦won't come
out, I have two bullet hole3 in me now."
The murderer fired twice through the
door, one shot taking effect on Colonel
McGlincy.
In the meantime Robert Briscoe jumped
through the rear window and started to
run away along the fence. Dunham
heard him and was at once after him. He
fired two shots, both going through hi3
body," and Briscoe fell dead.
The attention of the murderer being,
thus diverted for the moment. Colonel
McGlincy opened the door of the shanty,
and seeing the coast apparently clear,
started as fast as he could for his own
house, but before he had gone twenty
paces he fell shot through the heart by
the ' murderer, who having finished Bris
coe, returned to his elder victim-
Schaible Has Close Call.
Dunham then turned his attention to
Schaible, who had retreated to the upper
part of the barn and hidden himself in
the hay. Dunham approached the door,
calling "George, where are you?" Thi3
call he repeated many times and receiv
ing no answer passed Into the barn,
climbed the ladder and as he Â£tood on the
toi> round with his head above the level
of the floor, struck a match and by its
light peered around for another victim.
Not seeing him, however, he descended
and taking out a horse without a saddle,
mounted and rode to the house.
In the interval between the killing of
the three women and the return of the
men to the house, Dunham had occupied
himself in getting together some of his
small personal effects and probably what
money was in the house. These, with hi3
letters and every photograph of himself
about the place, he made into a bundle
and laid aside till he was ready to depart.
Securing this bundle he again mounted
his horse, rode back and forth along the
road several times and then disappeared.
These latter movements were seen by a
neighbor, L. C. Ross, who. aroused by
the shots that had been fired, came over
toward the McGlincy place. When Dun
ham rode away Ross cautiously ap
proached the barn and, being joined by
Schaible. they both entered the house,
where the full horror of the fiend's work
burst upon them. The four persons In
side were found dead, as described.
Many Suspects Are Arrested. .'".
Ross and Schaible rode at once toCampi-.
bell and gave the alarm. Within a short
time mounted posses were scouring the
country In every direction. Every Sher
iff and Constable in all the counties
around had been notified of the deeds that
had been done and furnished with a full
description of the murderer, but from that
day. though frequent reports have c^me
from every part of the CQuntry of th" ar
rest of a Dunham suspect, he successfully
eluded all the vigilance of the officers and
the detectives until the present time.
At the time of the sextuple murder Dun
ham was about 30 years old and had been
married two years to the daughter of
Mrs. McGlincy by a former husband. He
was idle and apparently without purpose
in life and lived on the McGlincys, do
ins: little in return for his keeping.
The previous February he had entered
Santa Clara College with the avowed in
tention of taking a full classical course.
For a time he applied himself with some
diligence, but soon fell back into indiffer
ence in his studies and irregularity in at
tendance. He was a man of very morose
and disagreeable disposition and by some
was thoueht to be deranged. The nurse
who attended his wife at the birth of their
child described him as being "the meanest
man that ever lived â too mean to be
crazy " Dunham's baby boy. the survivor
of that awful night, is living in Santa
Clara County with relatives of Colonel
McGlincy.

DTTNHAH'S TERRIBLE DEEDS.
His Fury.
How Six Persons Became Victims of
In. the last hours of the 26th and the
early morning of May 27, 1S96, on the Mc-
Glincy ranch near Campbell, Santa
Clara County, James Dunham committed:
deeds unparalleled in the annals of crime
in California. -
Six persons fell victims to his insatiable
thirst , for, blood, among whom were his
wifei mother of his lately born babe; Mrs.
McGlincy, mother of his wife, and her
husband, Colonel R, P. McGlincy; her
son, James K. Wells; Minnie Shessler, a
servant kvc\, and Robert Brisco, a hired
man en the place.
The first of the murders is supposed to
have been committed about 10 o'clock at
night. The murderer' had made full prep
arations for his bloody work. The actual
happenings were learned from an inspec
tion of the premises after the discovery
of the deed. His wife was the iirst vic
tim. Approaching the bed, where she lay
with her babe at her side, he strangled;
her with his hands, forced the bed clothes
into her^mouth to stifle her cries and
twisted her head till he broke her neck.
Minnie Shessler, in .the next room,
alarmed by the. noise, partly dressed and
opened the door of 'Mrs. Dunham's room.
As she stepped across the threshold she
was struck to the floor by a crushing blow
on the head from the pole of an ax. The
blows were repeated with the edge and
back of the weapon until her head was a
shapeless mass.
The murderer then descended to the
room below, where ' Mrs. McGlincy,
alarmed by the unwonted noise above,
was preparing to arise and investigate
the cause. She was struck down with a
blow in the head from the murderer's ax,
and repeated blows followed till her head,
too, was crushed out of shape. Then came
an interval of two hours of brooding and
waiting in the presence of his victims, for
his work was not yet completed.
Pursued by the Assassin.
Colonel McGlincy,' with his stepson,
James "Wells, and a hired man, George
Schaible, had left the premises early in
the evening for the purpose of attending
a meeting of the American Protective As
sociation. They were due to return short
ly after 12 o'clock. About that hour they
approached th-3 house. In passing the
barn Colonel McGlincy said to Schaible.
"Open those doors, it is too hot' in there,
and throw down some hay to the horses."
That order saved George Schaible's life.
Colonel McGlincy, with James Wells fol
lowing close behind, stepped upon the
porch and- with 'his latch key opened the
door to pass into the house. As he moved
across the threshold into the dark hall
he was struck a terrific blow., on the side
of the head with the pole of the ax. and
went to the floor stunned, but not en
tirely unconscious.
Wells, probably not for an instant divin
ing the identity of the assailant of his
stepfather, bravely closed in and grappled
with him. Broken and overturned furni
ture, scattered through two rooms, told
the story of the fearful but vain struggle
which the young man "made for his life.
His body was iound at the far end of the
Â¦second room with five bullet holes through
it, the last one evidently killing him.
Colonel McGlincy soon recovered . him
self, sprang to his feet and, running
through the house as the last shot was
being fired at his stepson, sprang out of
the window, and ran toward the barn, or
rather toward a shanty where fie hired
men slept, which stood near the barn.
Dunham heard 'him and was sojn at his
heels. McGlincy reached the shanty first
and, getting inside, closed and oarred the
door. 'Â¦' '-..â¢â¢â¢ ,
Dunham approached the door of the
shanty, pistol in hand, tried it and, finding
it fastened within, attempted without suc-
" George Schaible having done his work at
the barn, was about to start for the
shanty when McGlincy appeared running
from the house with Dunham in pursuit,
firing as he ran. Being entirely unarmed.
Schaible drew back within the darkness of
-the interior and watched what f ollowed.

There Is comfort In the knowledge so
_pften expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every wish in curing rheuma-
tism, pain in the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects Inability to hold
water and scalding- pain in passing it, or
bad effects following use of liquor, wine
or beer, and overcomes that' unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-

wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If yt>u need a medicine you should

After donning his street clothes
Gardner went upstairs and paid
his respects to McGovern. He
shook hands with his vanquisher
and they had a little heart-to
heart talk. Gardner is now one of
McGovern's stanchest admirers.
"The first punch did the busi
ness," he said, in explaining his
defeat. "As soon _ as I got the
clip alongside the jaw I was dazed
and remained so for all times. I
was In splendid shape and the only
excuse I can offer is that McGov
ern is a better man. He has im
proved wonderfully since our first
meeting.. He is even faster and
seems to have developed his
punching powers. He dazed me
and I put up 'a poor fight. I
missed, time and again."
Gardner' revived very quickly
and was able to leave the ring
with but slight assistance. After
being rubbed down he donned his
street clothes and unlike McGov
ern received .the -condolences of
his friends. The latter, howecer,
praised .Oscar for his game ness
and assured him that he had put
up a good fight, but it was diffi
cult to make him believe It. Gard
ner showed signs or having en
gaged in a fistic exhibition. His
face was badly swollen and pre
sented a sad appearance.
GARDNER HAS -NO EXCUSES.
The halrdesser feels no compunctions
about dying an old maid. Â»! â¢
He seemed to be in a maze throughout
the bout. In his perplexity he would
walk over to where Charley White, the
well known referee, was sitting:, and
mutely appeal for advice, but none was
given him. When McFadden was sent to
the floor in the last round it was his
duty to jump between the fighters, and
his neglect to do so resulted In an un
satisfactory ending to an excellent, box
ing contest.
In the opinion of hundreds at the ring
side McFadden should never have won
on a foul. When knocked to bis knees
in the tenth round, the "Kid" was be
wildered. He heard the count and was
making a move to rise to his feet when
Dougherty, in his eagerness, led * for his
head. The referee promptly disqualified
him and when it dawned on the crowd
there were hoots and Jeers for him. Eck
hart did not prove the best referee fax the
world.
by McFadden. In the first round Dough
erty dropped the California bantam and
repeated this in the last round.
McFadden seemed to possess the stlffer
punch, but he was unable to find the Phil
adelphia boy. Dougherty was a veritable
will o' the wisp and flitted round the ring
so fast that McFadden could never land
his srlove with directness.
The bout was one of the best ever put
up by bantams In this city. The lads
fought like a couple of lightweights and
each round was full of excitingr boxing.
Dougherty's cleverness stood him in good
stead. He landed time after time on the
"Kid" and got away without a return.
When McFadden landed Dougherty felt
the sting, but like a wise boxer side
stepped and blocked until safe and out
of reach.
Round 4 and the end was installed.
Two, three, four, five, six times Gardner
was dropped In his tracks. He was dazed,
stunned, groggy, but gamely held on. He
knew full well that all chances for stay
ing had evanesced, had been beaten to a
nothingness. Just as his own hopes of vic
tory had been crushed, yet he tottered to
his feet and fought on. Then came the
stomach punch which ended all. It was
another victory for Terry, the sixth de
feat for Gardner out of 509 fishts.

Referee Eckart saw fit to award the fight
to the local boxer on a foul. His decision
did not find favor with the spectators and
he was roundly hooted. Dougherty should
have- been declared the victor, as his work
was far better than the showing made
Right Body Punch Did It.
â¢ Out of the Ring Goes Gardner.
In the third round the blood began to
spurt and roll out of Gardner's nose and
mouth as the heavy straight left and
right smashes would find a smackful rest
ing place on his head or face. There was
one fitful mix-up in this round in which
Terry received a reminder or two that he
was in a fight. Then he went at his game
with renewed vigor. .Clenching his teeth,
half closing his eyes and straining his
muscles McGovern began a hammering
act that would make him a leader among
the elect. By a fistic whirlwind or two
or three he had Gardner out of the rlngr
and sprawling all over the reporters , on
the stand below. Helped within the ropes
Gardner came back only to be saved by
the gong. .

McGoverri is a marvel and "Terrible
Terry" is a fit name for the Brooklyn
boy. ;His punches possess power enough
to put a, much larger man than Gardner
to sleep, and he lands them just where
they are most harmful.
The fight, of course, was a trifle one
sided, . but Terry . has it in" him . to . make

McGovern. .- - "-, -: - . . Â¦; .
He is all fight from the sound of the
gong. and keeps at' his opponent in a
manner that only a man in the best of
condition could. He :is not afraid of. a
punch and sometimes takes a desperate
chance to land one of his own.' He is
clever and remarkably fast on his feet
and never loses his head.
Gardner is one of the- gamest men I
have ever seen in the ring. He stood
McGovern's powerful blows and came
back- for more. -For Gardner it was an
uphill flght, as he had to contend against
a man stronger and quicker than himself,
and above all, a man many years his
junior. .
Altogether It was : a pretty flght. My
position as. referee was not. an onerous
one. The knockout was clean and left
no room for debate as to who was 'en
titled to the match.
sinewy, he was certainly the physical
superior of his vis-a-vis. Gardner's short,
shuffling legs and much battered face
made him seem an old man compared with
the strong boy opposite.
The bell sounded and the flght began.
Very little time was wasted by McGovern.
Suddenly he shot out. the whole of him
at once, right at Gardner and then there
was no let-up in his fistic furnishings.
Three times he had Gardner down on his
haunches and once on the flat of his back.
A left punch on the vulnerable point of
the chin was the first severe blow struck,
and it made the fight an easy one for
Terry ever after. Were it not for the bell
that sounded, Gardner's second flght with
McGovern might have lasted but a single
round. -
When the second spasm was unrolled
Gardner's legs seemed suddenly made
heavy. The punishment he took in was
tremendous, but he returnedâ but never
spry or seemingly happyâ for more, which
he got In double portions. Terry wa3 there
all the time, whether Gardner was looking
or not. Left and right, boring holes Into
Gardner, Terry was relentless yet fair
and honest in every blow struck.
IN my estimation both these little fel
lows are "wonders. . They are both
strong and willing and game to the
core and put up a fight that will not

THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART
â¢ Â¦ 'â¢ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦
MUD larks were In big demand at
Oakland track yesterday, and
the talent managed to pick up
four very profitable bargains In
Decoy, Phyllis, Malay and
Handicapper. All were favorites In the
betting, but on account of the soggy and
uncertain condition of the track, the
market prices were. good. Showers fell
throughout the afternoon. , which fact did
not deter a fair sized crowd from at-,
tending. '-:.'Â¦>':.Â¦
Ex-Jockey George. Miller told his
friends Decoy was a "moral" for the
opening scramble, and at odds of 16 to 5,
the Deceiver gelding came home first in
clever fashion. Barney F., after mak
ing the . running, lost, out by less than
a length. Lost Girl ran a fair third.
Of the eight maiden two-year-olds,
Phyllis was selected as best, closing a 9
to 10 favorite. B. C. Greene,' the 'â¢ second
choice, went out in front at the start with
a sharp turn of speed, but couldn't stay,
and the first choice won easily by. three
lengths. Phil Crlmmins. from the Elm
wood'farm, finished in the show.
Through clever handling, Jack Martin
landed the third purse with Un Cadeau,
a 6 to 1 shot. When Wallensteln, the
lukewarm favorite, had tired after chas
ing The Singer well into the stretch, Mar
tin made his move. Using his customary
rough tactics, he cut off the fast coming
Nilgar. scoring by a length. In a hard
drive Nilgar lost the place to Wallensteln
"by a head. Alaska, with Bergen up, was
well backed, but unfortunately- Bergen's
saddle turned and he was kept busy stick
ing on the horse's back. . - ,Â¦
Bergen. met with better Buccess In the
five furlong dash for two-year-olds, riding
a perfect race on Rory Ough. Sol Lich
tensteln fell in for extensive support at
even money and his downfall staggered
the short-end players. Rory Ough out
broke his field and, rated nicely by Ber
gen, got the decision down at the wire by
half a length. Huachuca,- a handy colt
from Johnny Campbell's stable, after
looking a possible winner, broke down,
pulling up in bad shape. â¢ Royalty took
third place. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ - ' . â¢
Right at home again In the sloppy going,'
Malay captured the mile selling event,
running away at the end. . A 6 to 5 favor
ite, with Alexander up, the brown gelding
was never headed, breezing in five lengths
before Ada N. Rio Shannon did not run
his race, ending up a fair third. .
: Ten well matched. "mudders" furnished
a perplexing betting proposition In the
final six furlong sprint, resulting in Hand
icapper and Pat Morrlsey closing equal
choices at post time. Ransch astride Mor
rissey got away back in' the. bunch and
never looked dangerous. Showing first

TALENT PICKS THE MUDLARKS WITH
MARKED SUCCESS AT OAKLAND TRACK
All the time consuming but necessary
preliminary discussion on the ring's center
spot having passed without hitch or un
usual delay the two fighters stood erect
in their corners, awaiting the clang -of
the bell that would bring them together.
They had chatted pleasantly a few min
utes before, just after McGovern entered
the ring, but now all was business. Mc-
Govern looked the fresh, the well-trained
ringster all over. Youthful, his eye bright;
his skin a healthy pink and his muscles
s
McGovern the Terrible.
Jack Gleason, manager of the Twentieth
Century Athletic Club, was arrested just
before the fight by Corporal Eagan, who
charged him with committing, battery on
an officer. Gleason was released on bail.
Eagan claims that he started to enter the
Pavilion, but was prevented by Gleason,
and that in the scuffle that followed the
manager struck him.
â¢i- â r
of a good size, rather quiet and of the
curious sort, composed of menâ and a few
heavily veiled women â who came there
just to see what manner of fighter this
little whirlwind . from Brooklyn is. Then
came the "Terrible" himself, followed by
Harris, Dukelow and little Danny Dough
erty, who won a prize but had it taken
from him by a misguided referee. At no
time .were the spectators fight mad as
they have been before and hope to be
again. There were no thrilling moments,
no situations provocative of Â¦ heart palpi
tations. "Hit him again, Terry"â and
hit him again Terry didâ was the cry
from the unenthusiastic spectators.
Gardner's portion was a lamentation.
Nothing But McGovern.
There was but a single man in the ring
at any time of the fight. McGovern was
there with both his fists, small in size, but
The fight did not last a full four rounds.
At the end of ! three of - \ them . Gardner
-heard- the -joyful clang that saved him
from the end of the ten-second count. In
the fourth the finish, in the shape of a
steam-propelled right full tilt upon the
stomach's tender spot, arrived and down
went Gardner, falling upon his face like
so much dead weight. Terry had used his
stiff lefts and rights with bloody execu
tion before the culminating bolt was shot.
Gardner's face â not pretty to look at In
repose and when free from the marks of
battleâ was all of a red, the blood flowing
softly and steadily from his mouth and
nose. When that right-hand blow landed
a grunt filled the air and Gardner was out
'for good. He writhed and moaned on the
ring floor, hearing distinctly the tolling of
the seconds as . Harry Corbett gesticu
lated in rhythm with the timekeeper's
sawing of the air. Ammonia, much water,
a plentiful fanning and a bit of alcoholic
stimulant brought the defeated pugilist
back to the realm of consciousness.
ton-^ERRY McGOVBRN is Terry Mc-
I Govern. As fighters go, he is sui
1 " generis, and no matter who comes
JJL his way, they all leave by the
same routeâ the ten seconds or
more of violently imposed forgetfulness.
Last night at Mechanics' Pavilion Oscar
Gardner felt what it was.to be brought to
the ring floor so many times that the
number became Confused. No match for
the Terrible Terry, Gardner clung to a
thin, frail strand of hope and took a beat
ing such as must have churned his in
sides and rattled every tooth in his headâ
and Gardner has a wide mouthful. Â¦ ',
Crowd Not Enthusiastic.
Both fighters weighed in at Harry Â¦ Cor
bett 1 s yesterday afternoon. The weight
limit was 124 pounds. McGovern did not
raise the beam even with a shirt on his
back and Gardner Just made it. This
being satisfactory to all concerned the
referee had no announcement to make
when the men came together in the ring
last night. Gardner was first to arrive
and he received a humble cheer from the
crowd which was not enthusiastic. It was
propelled by some unseen power that
makes the force of the "Terrible' s" blows
equal to that of a man many times heav
ier. Gardner was nothing but a subject,
something to receive punishment for a
limited duration and, when endurance and
physical strength had left him, to fall to
the ground, helpless and beaten." Gardner
showed pluck. He took a beating, several
beatings, came back for more, shuffled
out a. brief space of fisrhting in trying to
stay Â¦ with th-3 Kame and then collapsed.
He closed finally like a jackknife.
So one-sided was the fight that the club
has been censured for bringing McGovern
and Gardner together. It is safe 'to say,
however, that McGovern. is so far beyond
anything else in his class that no real con
test results whÂ«;n he is matched with one
of his own. weight. - The public did not
see a fleht last night .In the sense of;a
contest, as it was- McGovern in the bone;
McGovern. In , the flesh .and McGovern in
the blood. And this same Terry has im
proved on his former self. Eastern ex
perts find the same dash, the same unre
lenting vigor and forcefulness in his
methods of attack, combined now. with a
clever defense. He Is shifty on his feet,
fast as a man can be, and he never slows
down. As soon as the referee has sep
arated him from his opponent he is back
again at the human mark, hammering,
smashing, churning, never satisfied until
the referee waves him over to his corner
and the battle is won.
WINNER OF THE BIG BOXING EVENT AND SOME OF THOSE PRES
ENT AT THE BOUTS THAT WERE HELD LAST NIGHT . AT ME
CHANICS' PAVILION.
McGovern is fighting as he always fights
â sr.xious to finish his man as quickly as
possible. He is the perfect type of a fight
ing machine, combining qualities of quick
ness on the style cf heavy artillery. He
is a little anxious to commence proceed
ings. Gardner simply was the receiver
As the bell sounds both men spring to
the center of the ring. Without a mo
ment's hesitation McGovern lets fly with
left, right and left on head and face.
Gardner covers himself and backs away.
McGovern is anxious. They clinch and
Gardner lands three lefts on body. They
break cautiously. McGovern lands left
and right on face. McGovern cops a short
left on Gardner's jaw. Terry is very eager
and lands a brace of lefts and rights on
jaw and nearly drops Gardner. McGovern
is too anxious, and misses left swing. He
then lands hard right on body. Terry
lands left and right on head. Gardner
places two lefts on body, but McGovern's
attack is not stayed. McGovern tries to
catch Gardner on jaw in the breakaway.
Terry hits Gardner on Jaw and turns him
over. Gardner rises and Terry is after
him like a demon, but is fighting wild.
Gardner Is dropped again, but Is soon up
and Terry is wildly anxious to finish him.
Gardner hits low and Terry says, "Oscar,
you're hitting low," and Gardner answers,
"I did not mean it." Terry appears anx
ious to finish his man and lands a blow
on the head that turns Gardner com
pletely around. Terry is .fighting very
wild. He lands a hard' straight left on
Gardner's body as round ends.
Round One.

OVRDNER and his seconds 'entered
the ring and took thÂ« southwest
. corner. The "Omaha Kid."' as
usual, was the first in the arena.
He- wore a very confident smile
and his face looked bright. After five
minutes' delay McGovern and his retinue
put in an appearance at the eastern end
of the Pavilion. Harris was in the lead
and behind him came the little champion.
Dougherty and the other seconds com
pleted the procession-. McGovern was
wildly cheered. He entered the ring at
tired in a fed and green sweater and
locked to be in splendid fettle. Advanc
ing toward Gardner, the latter met him
half way. They smiled and shook hands.
Gardner surrendered his corner and took
the one at the northeast portion of the
building. â¢ The men quickly stripped for
the fray and were called to the center of
the ring. Referee Harry Corbett then de
livered his instructions and Announcer
Biily Jordan introduced the pair. ix>ud
cheers greeted each man and they retired
to their corners to await the signal of the
gong to begin hostilities.
McGovern listened to advice from Har
ris, took a parting drink out of a bottle
and awaited the signal. Gardner was like
wise advised. Both men were in the pink
of condition.

Terry goes back to his corner confident
while Gardner shows signs of the severe
punishment he has undergone. Oscar's
training is standing him in good stead. .
'.Â¦: > ; Round Four. V - Â¦'; ;_:-,-.'
Terry Is first up. He '.lands Jeft ion
'stomach and sends right to head. Terry
smothers Gardner's, wild swings. Terry
plants a hard left on stomach. â¢Â¦â¢ Terry
puts right on jaw and knocks Gardner
backward. Terry follows up quickly and
sends hard left to stomach and whips
in right on face and Gardner falls.
George Harting, the official timekeeper,
counts ten, and Gardner is out, but Ref
eree Corbett makes a mistake, and does
not declare Terry the winner. Oscar
rises again and is helped to his feet. He
is sent down a moment later and while on
his knees, Terry sends a left that brushes
Oscar's hair. There are cries of foul
from, the spectators, but no foul ha*
been committed. Terry smiles and shakes
Oscar's head. Gardner is up again and
they are again at it. Terry "wants to end
it here but swings wildly. Gardner lands
a good right, but Terry Is not to be
deterred. He watches his chance and
puts a terrible right on body and Gardner
drops to the floor a beaten man. The
time of round is 2:35. Gardner is un
able to rise and his seconds fan htm
while he is lying on the ground. The
body blows hurt him.
McGovern is holding back, judging
from what I have seen him do in former
fights. Terry misses and corrects his mis
take by putting an awful right on Gard
ner's body. Terry hooks right on jaw
and follows up with a brace of rights
knocking Gardner through the ropes.
Gardner turns a comolete somersault in
his journey. He is helped back into the
ring. Gardner Is taking a severe beat

out of danger and catches McGovern

the body. Gardner puts two light lefts
on Terry's face and McGovern retaliates
with a right in face and a right upper
cut. Gardner rushes, but Terry smothers
his blows. Terry is following him around
the ring raining blows on Gardner. Terry
puts a hard left on face and straishtens
Gardner up with an uppercut. Gardner

credited with being. Terry hooks left on
face and hard right on neck. Terry puts
left on body and holds back right. Terry,
puts an awful left on face and repeats
the blow with even greater force, making
Oscar's head rock. Terry uppercuts hard
on stomach. McGovern lands right and
left on jaw.-- , â¢Â«â¢Â¦
Round Three.
Gardner meets Terry's rush with a right
on face. Terry is right back at him and
receives two good punches for his pains.

OMAHA, April 30.â An agent of the kid
napers has made a proposition to Edward
A. Cudahy to return $21,000 of the money
paid fur his son's ransom, demanding In
return a withdrawal of the $25,000 reward
and a cessation of the search that Is be
ing prosecuted, together with an abandon
ment of the determination to punish the
criminals.
The proposition came in a letter- from
Elgin, HI., and Cudahy is convinced of its
authenticity. He went to Chicago ten
days ago because of it, being summoned
there by his brother in response to over
tures that had been made. He refused to
consider the offer, and declares his un
changed resolve to prosecute to the end
the search for the men "who stole his boy.
"I received a letter about ten days ago,"
said Cudahy. "It was dated April 15 at
Elgin and bore the Elgin postmark. I
cannot show it to you because I sent it to
Pinkerton, nor can I give you its contents
veibatim, as I did not make a copy-of it.
It was very brief and recited that the
chief kidnaper had communicated with
the writer and was getting uneasy. It
set forth that the chase by the detectives
was getting uncomfortably close, and
asked if I would withdraw the offer of
reward now outstanding and let up on
the effort to find the criminals and have
$21,000 of the $25,000 ransom returned to
me.
"It seems that the writer got somewhat
in a hurry, for as soon as he mailed, the
letter he must have slipped right over to
Chicago, .where he called on my brother
Michael the same day, which was two
weeks ago to-day. He asked my brother
whether I would consider a proposition of
that kind. My brother told him that ho
did not know anything about it, but would
ask me to come to Chicago and talk 1he
matter over, although he did not believe
that I would consider it. That afternoon
I received a telegram from my brother
acklng if I could come over, and I replied
that I would be over there in the morn
ing.. I left here on the afternoon train
and on reaching Chicago learned what
had transpired at that end of the line.- I
arrived home on Thursday and the letter
from Elgin was here awaiting me. The
letter was signed and gave directions how
a reply should be addressed to reach the
writer at Elgin. I do not wish to make
that public, as .'assurances were given
that I would not. and that the party could
submit such a proposition as he desired
to make.
"So far as the offer Is concerned it has
been rejected. I refused absolutely and
unqualifiedly to consider, it and am deter
mined to prosecute this search as vigor
ously as I know how.- That is what we
started out to do, and I feel as If I would
follow those men to the end of the earth.
I realize that this means $46,000 and that
is a sum that is certainly an object to any

WASHINGTON. April 30.â The Navy
Department has decided to take steps im

connection of- Lieutenant Townley with
the army scandals in Manila developed by
his testimony before the court martial
yesterday. Admiral Remey being absent
from the station, an order will go for

MANILA, April 30.â General Tlnio, with
his entire comnpand, surrendered April 20
to Captain :< Frederick V. Krug of the
Twentieth Infantry,; at Sinait, province of
South' Iloco. . j. - , 'Â¦ . .'
The report that General Alejandriho has
surrendered is confirmed.' He was looked
upon^as the possible successor of Apul
naldo. \ Padre Aglipay, the excommuni
cated â¢ Filipino priest/: who preached the
doctrine of a holy war against the United
States, has also surrendered.
Captain John B. McDonald," with twen

"WASHING f ON. April 30.â Two important
cablegrams were received to-day at the
War Department from General MacArthur
at Manila.' In the opinion of the officials
the news contained in them marks the al
most complete collapse of organized re
bellion in the Philippines. The cable
grams are as follows: *
"General Tlnio surrendered with -his
command to-day at Sinait. He will deliver
all men and guns in his command as soon
as t^iey can be gathered together. This
completely pacifies the first department.
Northern Luzon, for many months the
worst in Luzon. " Colonels Ciprlano Calloa
and Gregorio Katlbac, Malvars' best of
ficers, surrendered to Colorjel Kline at
Lipa on April 28 with 23 officers, 108 men
and 86 rifles.',' .
Tinio'is said here to have been, with Ale
iandrino,'one of the highest officers in the
insurrectionary force. He was in command
in Northern Luzon during the famous
chase after Commander Glllmore.
Malvars, whose colonels surrendered to
Kline, was also one of the best-known
Filipino leaders. He 'was Lawton's moot
formidable foe rnd commanded the insur
rectos at the fight at Zapote River, the
most serious battle fought in the Philip
pines. He has confined his operations to
Southern Luzon, which never has been
completely subjugated, and Lipa, where
the surrender occurred, has long been one
of the principal insurgent' arsenals.
- Â¦ It is said at the "War Department by of
ficers recently back from the Philippines
that there now remains in the field in
Luzon only one chief whom they are par
ticularly desirous of catching, namely,
Cair.es, the head hunter. This man' has
violated every rule of warfare, and it is
not expected that he will be taken alive.
Later the following cable message, dated
to-day at Manila, was received from Gen
eral MacArthur announcing several other
important surrenders in the Philippines:
Â¦ "Juan- and Bias Villamos, leaders of
Abret, surrendered at Bangued April- 27;

MOST of the warnings of. the time, come from'
Great Britain, where the people for good and
sufficient reasons have ' had their attention
turned to dangers ahead. With their' coal- supply
diminishing in Â» quantity and increasing in the cost of
production, their trade menaced by rivalry^ of: vigor
cus nations like the United States and Germany, and
their taxes, increasing, it is not strange they should
begin to take note of other conditions in an effort to
forecast where the next blow, will fall.
. One of the forecasts of coming trouble is based
upon the diminishing supply of timber in the world.
An experienced forester has informed the British pub
lic there is no doubt whatever of an approaching tini-'
ber famine. In reviewing his statement "the West-,
minster Gazette says:; ''If it was not for the foreign
supplies, we receive, a timber famine would have over
taken this country long ago, because our home-grown
supply has not been able to -meet .-a 'tithe: of. the de
mand for. long enough, and that only of inferior kinds
of timber. If the foreign supply of fir alone was to
fall off sensibly now, the whole building. trade of. the
country .would come to a .partial standstill, and our.
wagon companies would. be next', to idle. .The great
consumers of, what ' used to be called ship-timber' are
now railway-carriage, and wagon builders, who alone
absorb most -of the best, hard woods to an extent ex
ceeding anything known when ships were built of
timber." Â¦- ..'â¢â¢.';';- \v\ : "vvvV v '/^ Â¦:â¢Â¦.:.;â¢ - : :

A TIMBER FAMINE.
AT a recent meeting of the Wholesale Seeds
men's League in New York there were made
concerning the distribution of free seed by the
Government a series of charges that should be
promptly investigated. The charges are to the effect
that the seeds furnished to, the Government on the
April contract do npt accord with the specifications
in either quality or 'quantity. The league declares:
Firstâ The specific varieties of seeds indicated in the
printed specifications of the 27th of January, 1900, -have
not been supplied, but very common and very cheap
sorts substituted, this giving the contractor great ad
vantages. â¢ â¢ Â¦ .
Secondâ No varieties whatever are named on the
printed packets,' only the words "A selected variety,"
this giving the contractor great advantages. ' .
Third The stipulated weights named in the specifica
tions ol the 27th of January, 1900, have not been given,
but reduced' quantitiesâ from 10 to 50 per cent less than
the specifications, this giving the contractor great ad
vantages.
Fourthâ Because of other irregularities which can be
named, giving 1 the contractor extraordinary advantages
for enormous profits. r : ' ' .
By reason of the variations from the terms of the'
contract it is claimed the contractor could sublet his
bargain with the Government for, one-half the sum
"he is to receive, and the taker even at that figure
could make money out of it. Among the details
given to support the charge that the packages which
have been issued are below weight are these:^ "Pack
ages of cucumber, seed^were to run 80 to the pound.
Those weighed "run 104 to the pound. Onion seed,
which should run 96 to the pound,- takes 106; peas,'
which should run 160 to the bushel, run 304, and sweet
corn packages take 290 to . the bushel where they
should take -only 60. Packages marked, with the
names of high-priced . tobacco seeds contain only
cheap vegetable seeds, u while -jndne â¢ sho^ys.' contents,
such as were called for by the printed list upon them."
iTlffthe charges be true the Department of Agricul
ture has to confront a grave scandal, and an â¢ investi
gation is imperative^ The members of the league
are business men of high standing. It is known that
most of t! em are opposed tefhe free distribution of
seed by the Government,' but that does not. affect. the,
nature of their charges. Such specific allegations of
fraud, coming from 3uch a source and 1 accompanied
by details showing how the frauds are ; perpetrated,
cannot be ignored.

CORONADO TENT CITY. Coronado BÂ«acn.

The failure of agriculture in Elaine has led. the

Uncle soldiers who are being discharged
from service in this city are earning the unenviable
reputation of being cheats who dishonor the bills con
tracted in San Francisco. It might be well for the
military authorities to save their commands from a
stigma placed upon them by a few troopers who have
not yet recovered from the looting habit.
THE salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States is $10,500, and the
Associate Justices get $10,000.
Their position is the most important in the Govern
ment, and their work the hardest that is performed
in any office in the country. Upon them rests the
nnal responsibility of the constitutional administration
of the Government, and with them is the final deci
sion that determines the extent to which every man's
rights are protected or affected by the Federal con
stitution. By reason of our system of government
they constitute not only the most important but the
hardest worked judicial body that has ever existed in
thp. world. By reason ol our plan of written consti
tutions their work is the most important ever de
i:!-nded of the judicial mind. They have in keeping
the vital principle of our government. They are its
primordial germ. They are the fountain from which
its vigor is constantly renewed. If the rest of the
G'.Aernraent were to vanish to-morrow, so far as its
vis'ble and physical bocy is concerned, the rights of
all men and their constitutional protection would
neither lapse nor weaken.
In view of their labors and responsibilities their
compensation is painfully out of proportion.
Compared with the salaries paid local /officers in
New York and other large cities the Supreme Court
Justices are treated moil niggardly. In New York
City the City Comptroller gets $55,000 a year, the "City
Chamberlain $15,000, the corporation counsel
$15,000. The Mayor gets $15,000, and his secretary
S5000. The second assistant corporation counsel gets
50C3O. The city Supreme Court Justices get $17,500,
two surrogates get $15,000, and their clerk $8500.
Put these salaries alongside the $10,000 paid to
its Supreme Court Justices by the United States, and
it is difficult to find any tenable reason for the dif
ference in compensation.
Lawyers are not often rich. While they make good
iees they are not good investors, for the reason that
their profession absorbs them in attention to the busi
ness of their clients, and they have no time left for
their own. The better lawyer a man is the less likely
is he to be rich, because he has no time. It is given
to his clients, and the resulting fees seldom get
planted where they produce much.
No rich man has ever sat on the bench of the' Su
preme Court. We believe that not one of the pres
ent Justices is able to cwn a home in Washington,
and they nearly all, including the Chief Justice, eke
<rst their salaries by delivering lectures in the various
law colleges of the country.
It is a condition not creditable to the country. The
position requires ability of a high order and honor
impeccable. No man without these c/sentials has
ever reached that bench or ever will.
Yet every one who sits there now feels every day in
the year the pinch of an inadequate salary. They must
discharge Â¦ certain social obligations, and the salary
precludes the possibility of saving anything for their
families. The family of. Chief Justice Tariey was left
in absolute poverty, and the funeral expenses of Chief
Justice Waite exhausted the savings that he had been
ab!e to accumulate, so inadequate were they.
Yet Roger 'B. Taney had worthily succeeded John
Marshall, at the head of that great court, and Waite,
ss' leader of the American case before the Geneva
conference, had won 515.000,060 from England for his
countrymen.
It i= time to cease a. niggardly' policy which keeps
. these Justices living on a pittance when compared
with the labor and responsibility it requires, and
quite time to see^to it that no more of them'die.in
poverty and leave families to charity, as Taney did.
Congress will have the approval ol the country in
doubling the compensation of the members of tha*
court.

should lead to" the disclosure of so ' much in the way.
of fraud in connection with the free seed, distribution
as to lead the- Government to abandon the practice
altogether. As designed by, the early statesmen/of,
the republic the custom of seecj distribution was a
good one. Its original object. wks to introduce into
the United States the* best vari'etfcs of seeds of every
kindthat can be cultivated here. It was not the inten
tion to furnish any one with seedlthat he could' go to
the nearest store and. buy, but to I send out rare seeds
obtained from foreign lands. Tht free seed distribu
tion of to-day is very different from that early plan.
It is now hardly anything more than a. means of bun
combe campaigning." The Congressman, for the pur
pose of keeping the favor of his* constituents, scatters
throughout his district ' seeds! and, speeches, the one
about as good as the other, and there is no earnest
effort made to put even such seed as is distributed into
the hands of those who could and would make the
best use, of it. ' j
There is no more reason for. a distribution of free
seed in our time than Â¦ for a distribution of . free
pruning-knives or free gardening tools. Modern com
merce is so thoroughly organized and is so inces
santly active that anything in the way of rare or use
ful-seed discovered or produced in any part of the
world is placed in all parts of the United States by
the trade long before the Government could do it, so
that now we do not need even a distribution on the
oiiginal plan. A scandal thatwill lead to a thorough
consideration of the whole subject would therefore
do no greattharm to the' country. Even if no down
right frauds can be traced to any one connected with
the Department of Agriculture, enough can doubtless
be proven by_ the Seedsmen's League to show good
reasons why the whole system should be abolished.
HIS present tour -.5 the first extensive and pro
longed trial of President McKinley's versatility
.as a speaker.
It is noticeable that all of his speeches are models
of good taste. Never losing dignity, he enters the at
mosphere of his audience and pleases while, he in
structs. More nearly than any other of, our Presidents
he. resembles Lincoln in his command of those twin
forces of oratory, humor and pathos, and each seems
a a shade more delicate than Lincoln's. He is highly
gifted with that imaginative faculty which supplies the
grace and garniture o-f all speech. It would be diffi
cult for another, in as few words, to raise the whole
vision of inspiration as he. did to the students of the
University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, during the
first stop of his train after leaving Washington. He
lifted the scene above the commonplace, and by the
briefest phrase reminded the young men of a great
past which has no. significance for them except as a
spur to their ambition and an incentive to the culti
vation of the, qualities that will equip . them for
greate/ excellence than the generations from which
they sprang. . .
â¢Another charming quality in the President's talk is
his broad-minded appreciation of manly and persistent
effort, from good motives, though exerted against die
public policies and principles for which he has al
ways stood. Realizing that this competitive effort has
sharpened his own faculties, has been an important
part of his/own training, and that "strength comes of
effort and, there is no effort unless it is invited by re
sistance, he puts resistance upon its proper pedestal
and hails it as a friend and not as an enemy of the suc
cessful. How few of our public, jneij have been ca
pable of this wholesome and manly view of the great
struggle for supremacy which is the incident of all
achievement 1 Even when standing on the battle-fields
of the Civil War, where he fought as a young soldier
of the republic, there is not a shade of bitter memory
or a note of boasting. With that gallantry which goes
with the true soldierly spirit he rather exalts the cour
age and achievements pi the vanquished than of
the victor, and touches it all so delicately and well that
the men on each side of the great struggle are' glad
that they had each other to fight and to forgive when
the tragedy had, passed into history.
Doubtless during his tour he will discuss, seriously,
great questions of national policy, but he may be
trusted to treat them not from a partisan standpoint
but in a spirit of the broadest statesmanship and per
fect tolerance of adverse opinion. He is not that sort
which seeks the line of least resistance, for he knows
that in the conflict of opinions the only merit of vic
tory is in the overcoming spirit that establishes things
in the midst of tempest and trial. Foundations that
"are laid where a place must be made by supreme
effort for every stone are the foundations that stand.
His experience .has taught him all these truths, and
his career has risen into that calm of philosophy where
quarrel and recrimination have no place.
During this tour along with the pleasure felt by
the people in seeing and hearing the President will
go the education that is in his utterances, and he will
give freely the fruit of those public experiences gained
in the long service he has rendered to the people.
The story of his life is ideal. Beginning under the
hardy pioneer conditions of the West, winning his
bread and helping the household into which he was
born, he offered his life to his country and underwent
the trials of the march r.nd risks of battle. For him
war has frowned and thundered, and peace has smiled
and bestowed her bounty. In public life he has tasted
the extremes of fortune and has known the apparent
withdrawal of public favor and confidence and their
return, and the change from the hardest exile to the
highest exaltation. It is the final test of his quality
that he issues from alLthese bufferings and mutations
reither a cynic nor a pessimist, but a philosopher, a
statesman and an optimist. Therefore his contact
with his countrymen o>; this great tour will have only
the healthiest influence, and will be of value alike to
hi? political-friends and his political opponents. That
the whole country will be bettered by it goes without
sr.ying. - It is a great lesson for all men to see the
President going through the nerve-stretching expe
rience .of such a trip without uttering a questionable
Word, creating division among the'peopMe or losing
fcr a single moment the mastery of himself.
THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECHES:
and the. club" has a modest sum Invested
for benefit associations.
Good Results Follow Club life.
All over the country are springing up
many forms of social co-operation and
the clubs mentioned here are only a rew
of the more prominent examples. AmonÂ»
them no charitable organization has been
mentioned-, all the clubs described are
self-supporting and self-governing., it is
true that the factory clubs are more or
less, dependent for their success on the
good will of the employers, but where
the exoerlment has been tried in any fac
tory the good results have been so Quick
ly apparent that most employers find It
not only a good investment as regards
"he morale of the women but also a good
financial investment. The training ana
ihÂ« association help women in all ways,
and a chSe of occupation and broaden
in^ of view react most favorably on the
working capacity of the club members.
Social Life for Working Girls.
{ Many of the large women's clubs and
associations of the country, especially
such as own their own buildings, become
the center of much social life. The. In
dustrial and Educational Union of Boston
owns a large building, where -receptions,
musieales and evening entertainments of
all - sorts, of * constant occurrence. This
union salso gives its rooms for the use of
the Boston Association of -Working Girls'
Societies,- the Junior Workers'; Club and
the Union for Industrial' Progress. This
latter, association has between 200 and 300
members. Its aim is to k en"courage work-
Ing women to study the principles of eco
nomics and to promote a, spirit of socia
Â¦ billty and a hearty desire^for each-other's
best good; also to encourage orgapization
among working women, believing that
such organization tends to elevate the
character and improve the condition of
the worker. Lectures on some economic
or social subject are given Sunday after
noons during the winter.
' The National League of Women Work
era has branches in all the large cities of
the United States and the membership of
the clubs Is confined to working girls. The
most flourishlns branch of the association
is that in New York, which supports the
Alliance Employment Bureau. This same
organization supports five holiday houses
for the benefit of its members. Last sum
mer 3S9 guests were at the holiday homes.
One problem with which the association
has to struggle is the crowd coming to the
homes in August, while during June,
July and- September there are many
empty spaces.
The members of the Ally Club of St.
Louis are largely self-supporting women,
its headquarters. are at 1731 North Twelfth
street, and the club stands for co-opera
tion as a solution of the labor problem.
The object of the club is to build a co
operative boarding-house for its members,
and it has received some encouragement
in this effort.
A" Successful Vacation Club.
The Aloha Club of Chicago, all of the
members of which are self-supporting
women, has built a charming holiday^
home on the east shore of Lake Michigan"
within a short boat ride of Chicago. A
stock company was formed and shares
were sold to the. club members at $2 50
each. The land was donated and the
home was built; the members have deco
rated It themselves and the effect is ex
tremely pleasant. A good boarding-house
near the club furni3he3 meals, at $3 a
week. The clubhouse Is so near Chicago
that it is perfectly convenient for the
members to leave on Saturday afternoon
and spend Sunday at the club, returning
initime for work on -Monday morning. A
chaperon lives at the home from the be
ginning to the end of the season. When
the home is not occupied by the members
the courtesy of the club is extended to
those working women who can come re
commended by a member. This associa
tion affords the most practical and inde
pendent solution of that vexed question to
the business woman, where to spend the
vacation. Most of the other holiday
houses are largely philanthropic in char
acter and, while they meet the needs of
girJfV working on very low wages, to the
independent business woman It is unpleas
ant to accept their hospitality. There seems
no: reason why this movement ' inaugu
rated by the Aloha Club should not spread
over the country and thus a long- felt
need be supplied.
The Jane Club of Chicago, affiliated with
Hull house, occupies a structure built ex
pressly for the purpose. Because of its
successful career this club has become
celebrated all over the country.
A Girls' Mutual Benefit Club.
As an evidence of what can be accom
plished by a small number of young girls
in a neighborhood center, the Girls' Mu
tual Benefit Club of Chicago is. a most
inspiring example This club owns its
own clubhouse on Fulton street" and has
nearly paid the cost of the lot and the
house, which was about $7400, the mem
bers having raised by initiation fees and
dues about one-half the amount, the other
half being donated by their friends. The
clubhouse is a commodious building, with
a large auditorium, a library, dining-room
and kitchen. The average membership is
about 125, all working girls; the initiation
fee is 25 cents and the weekly dues are 5.
cents. Any girl over 18 years of age, rec
ommended by a member, is eligible for
membership. One hundred and fifty girls
have been graduated from the cooking
classes, membership in which is not con
fined to members of the club. Classes
in dressmaking, embroidery, millinery and
physical culture are carried on during the
winter months. On Thursday evenings a
neighborhood lecture is given on some
practical subject and on | Sunday after
noons a free concert, also open to the
neighborhood. During the last year. the
members have organized a social settle
ment with five resident workers; the work
of the settlement covers three kindergar
tens, mothers' meetings, classes in basket
weaving, drawing, chorus singing, physi
cal culture and a military drill. The Mu
tual. Benefit Club donates to the settle
ment the use of its building with heat
and light, and its many friends supply
money to carry on the work.
Work of \h\ Factory Club.
A new feature in club life is the factory
club and the number Is Â¦ increasing rap-
Idly. This movement has arisen from the
growing conviction that an employer owes
to his employes not only compliance with
the factory laws and a punctual payment
of their \wages but also some measure
of comfort and pleasant conditions in
which to carry on the work of their dally
life; this especially is the case when it
becomes a Question of the employment
of women. It Is now estimated that ovei
1,500,000 women and girls are working in
factories in this country; some of them
under deplorable conditions and most'of
.them subjected to severe mental and
physical strain. It is to mitigate these
conditions that the movement known as
the factory club has been inaugurated
Beyond doubt the clubs of the National
Cash .Register Company are the best
known;- especially the Women's Club
which has become a model for many
others. This club has a membership of
nearly 300, and it i3 entirely self-governed
It meets twice a month at 12:30 o'clock
half 1 ; an hour being on their own time
and the other â¢ half hour on the com
pany's time. The Looking Forward Club
of the . John ' Wanamaker Company' is a
very large club* ; and the Progress Club
of Legler & Co. of Dayton. Ohio, and the
Alert Club of the Gem Shirt Company,
also of Dayton, are modeled on the Cash
Register Company club. Some of the fac
tory clubs are also lunch clubs. Chicago
claims the credit Â¦ of having inaugurated
this ' movement. The Western Electric
Company employs about 900 girls and has
a club membership of over 300; in 1897;
when" the company built a large addition
to its factory, it presented -the club with
an entire floor, thus making two immense
rooms; the company- also furnished the
lightahd heat, . fitted up the kitchen- and
gave; much of the furniture, for the din
ing-room.- The membership dues- are . 10
cents a - month. The â¢ dinner is served at
neon and a supper In the evening for the
members who work overtime; | a midnight
dinner is also served for the night work
ers. The prices : are very low. for.every
thing ; served. During the winter/ classes
are carried- on in- music, ; sewing, 1 dress
making, embroidery and .millinery, v Sum
mer outings are planned for the members
Woman's Club. It was organized In 1S36
and has a membership of over 200. The ob
jects of the club are to loan money with
out interest to students or undergradu
ates of thiBieading women's colleges or to
women students of coeducational colleges;
also to establish foreign scholarships for
the benefit of women who have taken hon
ors In' American Â¦ colleges. :
There are many" clubs and associations
formed by professional Â» women, as phy
sicians, artists, lawyers and trained
nurses, whose- efforts are directed toward
bettering the* conditions of their own pro
fessions and increasing the financial re
turns. Â¦ .

XI.â CLUBS FOR. BUSINESS WOMEN.
Â¦ â¢ Â¦ - â¢Â¦Â¦â¢-â¢- -JZT
The entrance of woman into the outside
labor market is destined to produce great
changes in. her home - and social Â¦ life of
well as in her economic status"./- Most of
the professions and i trades g which under
lie the home and which in; the past were
entirely in the hands of women are, under
the present' industrial, conditions, con
ducted by firms and; great corporations.
By this specialization V of function' and
centralization of capital women have been
forced out 'of 'the.' home* and have-reluct
antly, in most cases," : accepted the inevit
able and become competitors for work in
the open labor' market. Â¦ '
. Even fifty years ago the number of wo
men employed in.- stores and factories
t was comparatively small' and practically
few occupations were open to them; to-day
they are found in ": nearly" all the trades,
and in most of the professions.. Each year
!sees an. increase in the number of employ
ments in' which* women are engaged and
!a proportionate increase in' the number
[of. women- seeking- employment Nor â¢; is
jthis; condition- 8f 'affairs confined to the
three. purely. .do'mmercial countries, Ameri
â¢ca/ .England and^ance;.; in V recent, re
'port issued by that. department bf.theGer-:
man 'empire' which corresponds . to "the
fUnited" States departmerirof labor, statis
tics .were given' showing, that over 5.500,000
iwbmen are wage earners in Germany. . In
[France the number i# even larger. -Any
:person who is skeptical as to the number
of- â¢women who are wage, earners outside
!of = their homes has but to read the 'Â¦e-
:portd of the State.. Bureaus or Labor^and
the State Public Employment Offices; the>
show. that ey.ery year a larger number of
women apply for situations.
(Growing Uniformity in Social Needs.
- Uniformity of occupation and responsi
bility has necessarily operated to bring
about a growing ' uniformity of social
needs and habits. Coeducation has empha
sized this tendency,, and- to-day girls
share not alone the studies of their broth
ers/but many of the games. In the pro
gressive universities and colleges for wo
men the curriculum is modeled as nearly
as possible on that of the men's universi
ties and colleges and more and more the
social life of the students is formed on
that of the men. In some coeducational
institutions, like Cornell University and
the University of Michigan, women even
live in chapter houses, with a chaperon
at the head of the house.
In every social center, the bachelor gin
is now a recognized factor and she en
jovs absolute social liberty. In several of
the large cities clubs fof women have been
organized, modeled on the men's social
ciub. London has several of these clubs;
in this country the Acorn Club of Phila
delphia is one example, and the Mayflow
er of Boston is another. Neither of these
clubs is literary or makes any pretense to
be educational; they frankly exist for the
comfort and convenience of their mem
bers. A cafe is attached to each of them;
men are, of course, not admitted to mem
bership and no liquor is sold on the prem
ises; any member by paying for a bed
room is at liberty to remain during a
night or longer, acording- to the rules pr
the club, and this privilege is frequently
claimed by professional women. In fact,
a young woman who often has profession
al engagements in Philadelphia told, me
that her membership in the Acorn Club
made It possible for her to fulfill evening
engagements under the most comfortable
and economical conditions/ The
Woman's Athletic Club of Chi
cago " was established for^ the com
fort, physical well being and social life
of its members and has no other aim. In
the near future every large city in the
country will have one or more such clubs
for the use of women.
Difficulties in Securing Comfort. .
"Women of means and leisure find it
easy to provide themselves with all these
comforts,- but professional and business
women who desire to secure comfort and
quiet in the business districts, where in
most cases, their occupation takes them,
are obliged to make special efforts In or
der to do so. ' â¢ Â¦'Â¦ Â¦
The money auestion is a most serious
consideration, for business women in most
cases have small incomes, and, according
to all reports, they have dependents . as
often as do men. As the wages of women
are low at best, it is difficult for them to
make both Â« ends meet and have even a
little to spare for their own comfort, and
yet no class of the community stands as
much in need of Quiet and comfort dur
ing their noon and leisure hours as do
professional and business women.*
An effort is being made to meet the de
mand for comfortable quarters in . the
business districts where women who are
'employed there can secure a good meal
at a reasonable rate, rest and some social
pleasures. The Professional Women s
League in New York is a club of this
character; it has rooms at'1509 Broadway
and has a membership of about 100. The
Business Women's Club of St. Louis is
an. organization of the same sort. While
the latter club is not carried on for finan
cial gain, it may, by. its charter, hold real
estate, erect buildings and engage in busi
ness to further its aims. This club has
rcoms on Sixth street, between Locust
and St. Charles; it has a membership of
184 and is said to be in a very flourishing
condition. It maintains a library, a read
ing room and a gymnasium and Is en
deavoring to establish an employment bu
reau for women and cirls.-

The Business Women's Club has rooms
In ' the Atwocd building, Chicago: they
consist of an artistic library, a Dutch din
ins room, toilet rooms, kitchen, offices and
other apartments. The' object of this club
Is to promote social life among the mem
bers; lunches and dinners are served each
day and receptions, lectures, dancing
classes and a gymnasium are provided for
in the rooms. The club also has inaugu
rated certain educational work. It alms
to discourage .women who are incapable
of pursuing business professions from un
dertaking them, hoping that- uneducated
young- women may be turned- into other
channels of occupation,- thus preventing
the lowering of the salaries of competent
women. .The initiation fee of the club is
$2 and the annual dues $4. - Special assess
ments may not exceed $1 ayear.
The New York Council of the Business
Women's 'Club has rooms 'â¢ downtown and
a restaurant' in connection with the club.
The 'president writes' that the : rooms are
comfortable and attractive and that they
serve an excellent luncheon at a reason
able price. The- New York branch also
has a circulating library, which 4s free to
the members. ,The Denver Council has
been greatly assisted by the - Denver
Woman's Club, the. club and the council
working together to secure new members
and to render the club a social center for
leisure and business women.
Plans" of, the New Century Club.
The Â¦ New Century Club -at ' Utica,- n; Y. ,
has solved the 'problem of -the. social life
of business women in the following happy
manner: The â¢ New Century . Club owns
its-clubh6USe : and .the rooms are always
open ' and - cir, club .- days two sessions â¢â¢ are
.held," one from 2 to 5 o'clock and the other

is given at both sessions. Supper is. served
at the club for the benefit of the. members
employed during- the Â¦-Â¦ day- and a- certain
number., of the club , members remain . to
take * their supper ; with the business
women.. This plan has worked admirably.

The trial of Corporal Owen Davis, ac
cused of extortion by dealers ln the neigh
borhood of the Presidio, was commenced
yesterday morning. Numerous saloon
keepers and clothing dealers testified to
the effect that they were enabled to col
lect the money, due them through the cor
ruption of Davis. They made, they said,
every effort to secure a pass from Colonel
Rawles. but were unsuccessful. They se
cured admission to the grounds, however,
by paying to Davis sums ranging from $5
to $10. The testimony Incriminating Davis
was strongly presented, as was also the
testimony offered for his defense. Davis
was defended by Lieutenant Charles T.
Boyd, Seventh Cavalry. The findings of
the court will not be made known until

Courtney and Bishop Are
Given Decision by
the Courts. -
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 30.
Councllmen A. W. Bishop and W. P.
Courtney will retain the seats in the City
Council given them by the appointment of
Mayor Barstow.
Judge Greene to-day granted Courtney
the injunction for which he prayed, per
manently restraining Burtchaell from at
tempting to get the seat for which he re
ceived a majority of the votes In the re
cent election, and declared Courtney to
be the duly qualified occupant of the posi
tion. Burtchaell made no appearance ln
court, and allowed the judgment to go
against him by default. â¢
Judge Ellsworth, who had the Blshop-
Smilie case, hesitated to go so far as to
declare Bishop the rightful Incumbent as
opposed to Smilie; he was willing to pro
tect the de facto member in the exercise
of his privileges and duties until it should
appear that some one else had a superior
right. A rival claimant, he .thought,
should not be deprived of recourseÂ«to the
courts to establish his contention. His
Honor took the case. under advisement.
He stated that unless further reflection
changed his opinion, he would hold that a
court of equity could go no further than
to enjoin an outsider from interfering
with the Incumbent of an office in the dis
charge of his duties.
Judge Greene, on the other hand,"grant
ed all the points contended for by Court
ney's attorneys. His. order declares 'that
! Burtchaell was never elected; that Court
ney was legally appointed, and that Burt
chaell must surrender his certificate of
election. .
The decree finds as follows: '
That at the municipal election held -in the
city of Oakland an March 11, â¢ 1901, said de
fendant, George T. Burtchaell, was not elected

tins a ftop to the insurrection. This has at
last been practically accomplished in a suc
cession of campaigns which have brought out
into bold relief the daring., the skill and the
indomitable resolution of our officers and men.
The campaigns have been wearing: and diffi
cult beyond description, both because of the
nature of the country and of the character of
our opponents. After the first few months the
insurgents ceased to oppose us in regular war
fare, their methods becoming more and more
such as by any stern application of the laws
of war would have forfeited their right to be
treated. - -
Let me ask you to Judge the future by the
past. Look back over the last three years
and see what we have done. Think how in
finitely better off Cuba and the Philippines
&ra, because of the policy upon which this
republic has acted. Mankind Is our debtor
for what we have done, and the doing of it
has raised our national character to a higher
standard than ever before. -We have made
mistakes, of course; let us profit by them
and avoid them hereafter. But at home and
abroad let us continue on the course we have
marked out. We talk much, and on the whole
we talk truly, of the future greatness of
our people. Let us *ee to it that our deeds
make good our words, that we talce . ad
vantage of our manifold . opportunities, and
do without flinching our manifold duties. We
are not to be excused if we fail to do all
that 13 required of a great nation, standing
as one of the great -powers of the earth;
and leaFt of all are we to be excused if. we
fail to keep in mind the principles that un
derlie all real greatnessâ the principles of Jus
tice and of mercy â of courage and of hon
esty, that fro to make up a national record of
clean livinjr and true manliness. ,'Â¦* i i 'Â¦Â¦

Carried Knock-Out Drops.
George Mitchell was arrested yesterday
by Corporal Egan . and Policemen Freel
and O'Brien on o charge of having knock
out drops in his possession. They observed
him and another man on Kearny street,
near Sacramento, and, knowing Mitchell's
record, Egan fallowed him to a saloon at
G38 Sacramento street. When Egan at
tempted to place him under arrest he
threw away a small bottle and showed
fight. He managed to break away from
Egan, who blew his whistle. Mitchell was
arrested at Montgomery and Sacramento
streets- and. threw* away another small
bottle. â¢ Both bottles were picked up and
were found to contain knock-out drops.
Mitchejl has already served a term of six
months\for a similar offense. Jesse Nel

taken off the coast run and will, until
further notice, operate over the old road,
the trains being dispatched from Oakland
pier instead of Third and Townsend
streets. On Sunday the Sunset express
will also be taken off the coast division
and will leave Oakland at 6:15 p. m., In
stead of from the Third and Townsend
streets depot.
The coast, division will not be used for
fast trains until the road is equipped
throughout with eighty-pound rails. At
present, on part of the track, old and
light rails are laid. They are not consid
ered safe by President Hays, and he ac
cordingly gave orders for only slow trains
to run over the division until the neces
sary changes are made.
It appears that the coast division was
poorly equipped throughout from the day
it opened. It is. said that at a number of
stations along the line there were not
enough clerks to attend to the enormous
traffic: accordingly, the service was bad.
The conductors are also blamed for their
lack of knowledge. : It Is said that some
of them did not know how to handle an
overland ticket, and thus helped to mix up
affairs. President Hays has decided that
the coast division will remain closed until
everything is In perfect working order.

Judge Greene at first demanded proof
of the charges made in the complaint ask
ing for the Injunction, but afterward de
cided to allow them substantiated by
tho failure of the defendant to answer.
Judge Ellsworth took the same' view as
far as the defendant was concerned. He
indicated his belief, however, that the
plaintiff should have brought proceedings
amalogous to a quo warranto, as it seemed
to him that in the present ease an in
junction was not the only mode in which
the plaintiff could obtain relief.
Warren Olney 'and John R. Glascock

office boys hurried here and there with
rotes, and a number of the officials met
and consulted in their respective offices.
The old employes shook their heads and
whispered "that there was something in
the air." Others were more confident and
feel assured that there will be no changes.
But all are still waiting for the official
circular that President Hays has prom
ised to issue before he makes any change.
President Hays keeps his own counsel.
To all inquiries about rumored changes in
the personnel of the staff he gives eva
sive answers. When asked if any heads
were to fall in the basket, he smiled and
answered: "No changes will be made be
fore due announcement has been made by
an official circular."
It is now generally concede that Fitz
hugh is out here to look over the road,
and that he will accept the position said
THE announcement made several
days ago that E. H. Fitzhugh, a
prominent Eastern railroad man,
had been offered the position of as
sistant to President Charles M.
Hays of the Southern Pacific appears to
be authentic. Fitzhugh, accompanied by
his wife and daughter, arrived from St.
Louis yesterday and registered .at the
Palace.
Mr. Fitzhugh is silent regarding his per
sonal affairs. He declined to be inter
viewed, but in s diplomatic manner spoke
of his impressions of the State. He
thought California a beautiful State, and
said that- this was his first visit to San
Francisco. "When asked if he came here"
to accept a position with the Southern
Pacific he shrugged his shoulders and re
spectfully referred the questioner to
President Hays.
Fitzhugh is a man of medium height,
about 45 years of age. His hair and mus
tache are slightly gray. He impresses one,
after a few moments' conversation with
him. as being possessed of executive
ability. He says that he resigned his po
sition with the Central Vermont road on
account of overwork.
"I really have nothing to say about my
visit here," he said. "This is my first trip
to the coast. I expect to remain in San
Francisco about a wee^k."
"It has been announced that you intend
remaining here arid will accept a position
as assistant to President Hays. Is that
true?"
"I decline to answer that question," re
plied Fitzhugh. "I am not in a position to
talk on that matter. I respectfully refer
you to Mr. Hays."
"Is it not a fact, Mr. Fitzhugh, that you
went â¢ to New York and met Mr. Hays
when he was East about two weeks ago?"
â¢ "Yes, I was there," answered Fitzhugh.
"In fact, I make a trip to New Tork ev
ery time that Mr. Hays is there on one of
to have been tendered him by President
Kays to act as his assistant. Hays and
Fitihugh are warm personal friends. They
have been associated together in the rail
rcad business for several years. Harriman
Is also i.\ friend of Fltzhugh. vV.*" vJ

BOSTON, April 30.â An imposing array
of speakers, headed by Vice President
Roosevelt, held the attention of 1600 mem
bers of the Home Market Club at Its
twelfth annual dinner in Mechanics* Hall
to-night. Vice President Roos.;velt was
seated on the risrht of the president of
the club. Oeorge R. I>raper. Among the
others near President Draper were Sena
tors Georpe F. Hoar and Henry Cabot
Lodge, Joseph H. Manley of Augusta,
Me.; Bishop "William Lawrence of Mas
sachusetts, William F. Draper, former
Ambassador to Italy, and Rear Admiral
Sampson.
Previous to the dinner a reception xras
held In honor of Mr. Roosevelt. The tm
n.ense hall was buns' on all sides with a
mass of color, numerous political mottoes
and pictures. Mr. Roosevelt was greeted
with a storm of applause and three
cheers. \Y T hen he could, make himself
heard he said in part:
During the last four years this nation has eo
conducted itself as not only to add Immensely
to our material prosperity but also to add to
the heritage of honor which we are to leave
our children. Yet we can do better work in the
future If we realize that we have worked well
in the rast.
In deallns with our new duties abroad we
must approach them in the same spirit neces
f*ry for the solution of the problems that con
front us at home â that is, in a spirit which
Fhall combine business efficiency with the
Mghest Etanda.nl of fearlessness and integrity
practical common-sense with resolute devotion
to duty. Only by acting in such a spirit will we
pvÂ»r be able to cleanse the dark spots in our
municipal life. Only by acting in such a spirit
can we solve the tremendous problems arising
from the extreme rapidity and highly complex
nature of our great industrial development.
Finally, only by acting in such a spirit can we
rightly do our duty in the new fields our labor
and effort have opened to us by the results of
the Spanish war. ;..
Duty Before the Country.
"Whether we are glad or sorry that this new
â¢work has been allotted to us is a matter of
Email moment compared to the purpose with
which we approach the work. The one is a
matter of temperament; the other a matter of
principle. Some among us feel that this gener
ation should count itself thrice favored â¢ by
Providence that to it is given the chance to do
Â«. xr.iphty task; that this nation should rejoice
ts a strone man to run a race, because the
future opens to it the same opportunity for
triumph-crowned effort which has been its
jrlory in the past. Others or us approach our
new duties ia more sober spirit, as matters
neither for Joy nor regret, but as tasks which
henceforth come in the day's work and must
Le performed as such. Yet others regTet greatly
that the necessity ever arose to do these new
tabks; but since the necessity has arisen have
no more idea or >liirk:nsr them than of shirk
ing any ether disagreeable and necessary du
ties. It does r.ct matter much which one of
these attitudes is curs; but it does matter im
mensely that we should show serious purpose in
<>ur actions and a serious appreciation alike of
the importance and difficulty of the task and of
the prime need of our doing it aright.
For good or for evil, we now find ourselves
wiih new duties in the West Indies and new
duties beyond the Pacific. We cannot escape
the performance of these duties. All we can
decide for ourselves is whether we shall do
them well or ill. In Cuba we have had to face
a harder because a- less simple task. We were
Tledped to bring peace, freedom and independ
ence to the islands, and we have been reso
lutely bent upon keeping that pledge, not
rnerely in the letter but in the 6pirit. To hava
driven out the Spaniard and then immediately
withdrawn our own forces would have meant
the breaking of our own pledge, for it would
have thrown the Islands Into a chaos but one
Oesre-e better than the tyranny which it suc
ceeded. Moreover. Â£uch a coursa would have
ratant the absolute certainty of our being
speedily forced to interfere again. "We would
commit a grave wrong to our own people if we
permitted the great island .which is our neigh
bor one? more to become a jJague spot of civil
ization; a Â«ill graver wrong if we permitted
the poFFibility of its ever being used against
us by s=<->me strong alien power. Our business
was to help in the development of those quali
ties in the Cubans which would render them
able to solve thÂ«* difficult problem of self-gov-
rmment; to further every movement for de
oercy in the island, and to give our aid to the
new Cuban commonwealth^as it strove to walk
alcne. This has been our consistent endeavor.
Qusstion in the Philippines.
Finally, we . come to the Philippines where
the difficulties were greatest of all. Perhaps
lew better tests of our worth as a nation have
ever been offered than this Philippine prob
lem. The temptation was great to shirk it
altogether. Such a course would have ap
pealed not only to many thoroughly honest and
excellent people who were Imperfectly in
formed, or who were misled by false analogies
or by sentimental considerations, but it would
also have been greeted with enthusiasm by
til short sighted people and by all in whom
the legitimate dislike of needless effort and
woro' tends to become an unhealthy fear of
all risk and trouble. But as we look back we
can now see that the national duty was really
plain. We could not give the islands back
to Spain; we could not see them taken by some
other European power; and least of all could
we turn them over to be scrambled for by in
surgent leaders, most cf whom were but lit
tle above the level of banditti, and the success
rif any of whom meant destruction to the peace
ful and law-abiding portion of the islanders,
end a more or less swift relapse Into bar
bs rism of the entire population. The first
thing to be done was to restore order by put-

LAUDS POLICY
OF THE NATION
The storm center seems to hang around
the head of Policeman Peter S. ChappelU
just now, ari it will b'e lucky for himii
he escapes being again brought before the
Police Commissioners. His alleged perse
cution o? Angelina M. Abbott, the girl
who shot De V/itt Clinton, the actor, has
been the means of bringing him once more
prominently before' the public.
When the case of the Abbott girl,
charged by Policemen Chappelle and Syl
vester with vagrancy and disturbing the
pea^e, was called in Judge Cabaniss' court
yesterday both offlcors declared on the
witness stand that sht> was in the habit of
walking the streets every night, and once,
they believed. sM accosted a man. When
they arrested her Saturday night she used
vulgar language toward them and expec
torated In their races. Chappelle made the
assertion that Judge Conlan, when dis
missing a charge of vagrancy against the
girl on April 18, told her to keep away
from CFarrell and Mason streets. The
Judge will appear as a witness for the de
fense to deny that he said anything of
the kind. All he said ln dismissing the
caso was that the girl had had trouble
enough. The case was continued till Sat
urday, when the defense will be heard.
Henri Pradel, proprietor of the lodging
house at 279 O'Farrell. street, where the
defendant rooms, was waiting to be called
as. & witness, and admitted that he was
afraid to testify, as the police might close
his house. He is to be called to testify
that he heard the notorious Mike Nolan
tell the defendant that his girl paid the
police $20 a month for protection and she
should do the same thing. The defendant
also declared that Nolan had told her
since her statement made to Captain Sey
mour Monday that he would deny every
thing she had said about him.
Lieutenant Price will, if called upon, be
a witness for the defense as far as Chap
pelle's credibility is concerned. The lieu
tenant stated in' court yesterday that
when â¢ Chappelle was a member of his
squad, about eighteen months ago. in
Chinatown, George Downey, a watchman
in Sullivan alley, told him that one of his
squa-l was taking money from a Chinese
house of ill fame. ! He was determined to
ascertain the truth of the allegation and
took the squad to the house and Chap
pelle was pointed out as the one who had
taken the money. The lieutenant report
ed the facts to the then Chief. Lees, who,
to avoid a scandal, did not bring Chap
pelle before the Commissioners, but re
moved him from the squad."
- Chappelle volunteered the following
statement last niÂ£ht:
"Price lies when he says I was con
fronted with the inmates of the house in
Sullivan ally and identified by them as
the man who extorted money from them.
Price never took me to such a house, and
no such incident as he describes ever oc
curred. He never took me before Chief
Lees and never accused me of talcing
anything.
"The manner of my removal from the
Chinatown sauad was this: Price an
nounced to me, 'You are relieved by or
der of your captain.' My captain was
Wittman, but when I went to him about
it he denied any knowledge of such an
order. Then I went to Police Commis
sioner Gunst, and by him was referred to
Chief Lees.
"Lees said to me, after hearing my
story. 'Do you want â¢ to gt> back on the
squad?' I said. 'No, but I don't want to
leave under a cloud.' Lees replied that I
had better go back to work and I did. The
matter dropped there. No investigation
was held and nothing more was heard of
the matter . until Price's statement was
made to-d,ay."

Cable advices from Japan state that the
American ship R, D. Rice has been burned
to the water's edge. She arrived April 11
from Philadelphia at Hiogo, Japan, and
must have discharged the bulk of her
cargo of oil. The loss of the Rice will
come hard on the California Shipping
Company. Soon after the concern was in
corporated it lost the May Flint in this
harbor; the Henry Falling took a year
to make the voyage from New York to
Hawaii; the John McDonald is now out
225 days from Baltimore for San Fran

her chances. Now comes the loss of the

BTJTI/T FOR- THE COAST THAD3.
New Four-Masted Barkentine James
a-ir^HE Oceanic Steamship Company s
II Sierra arrived from Australasian
I ports early yesterday morning. She
11 was delayed twenty-four hours at
Honolulu and was in consequence
l"te ce*ting here.
"in order to get the English mall that
came upon the Sierra away some very
quick work had to be done. Even as it
iva-^ the railroad authorities had to be
appealed to and the Limited Express was
held thirty-seven minutes at the request
of John D/ Spreckels, president of the
steamship company. The train leaves the
Oakland mole promptly at 10 a. tn. and it
was five minutes after that hour before
the Sierra was at her wharf. Assistant
Superintendent of Mails Cooper went per
se nally to the Oceanic wharf and checked
the 235 bags of mail into the wagons. The
teams were driven directly aboard the
regular ferry boat and on the way across
Mr Cooper made out his way bills. Once
on the other side the mail was packed in
to two cars and the express started.^ If
ail goes well the train will arrive in New
York, Saturday at 2:15 p. m. The Lucania
is scheduled to sail for Liverpool at 4 p.
m If the necessary connections are made
the mail will arrive in England ontime
The Sierra comes back mto port with
three records to her credit and all hands
are jubilant in consequence. She made
"I runfmm here to Sydney in nineteen
days ten hours and five minutes, the last
leg between Auckland and Sydney being
covered in three days three hours and
three minutes. Coming home the mail
boat made the run from Pago Pago to
Honolulu in six days four hours, thus
beating' the Sonoma's record by four
hours The Sonoma was passed one day
out from Pago Pago, making fourteen and
one-half knots. After leaving Honolulu
there was another mishap to the star
board engine, but even with that disability
she was making contract time.
j The Sierra. left the United States navy
collier Abarenda in port at Pago Pago.
The first and second cabin passengers
who came up on the Sierra were from
Sydney, N. S. W.; Auckland, N. Z.; and
Pago Pago. The following is the list:

The Pacific Commercial Museum has j
dee'ded to exploit the Philippine Islands
as thoroughly as may be done for the
purpose of collecting an exhibit that shall j
faciiitate trade between the t'nited States j
an-1 the islands' as much as possible. In j
pursuance of this decision Director Good- j
win has prepared instructions for an agent
of the museum, who is now at Manila.
The main object of the museum Is to j
learn what articles are now found to be I
mavketable in the islands, under what |
conditions thej' are marketed, how i
packed, how â¢ delivered, the price they ,
brir.g and In fact all the commercial facts
that concern them. In addition to this in
quiry will be made concerning the pro
ducts of the islands, such as hemp and
other articles that can enter into the com
mercial consideration of the merchants
cf this country. Samples will be collect
ed for the museum of all goods sold in
the Philippines and all leading native
products of the islands and descriptive
matter will also be gathered to give the
merchants and manufacturers the fullest
posfible information.
Mere complete collections than have
been made by the Philadelphia museum In
the Philippines are desired on the Pacific
Crest, the merchants of which have large
expectations in the direct trade line. In
fact it is found that the Pacific Museum
will gain advantage by specializing in
collections in Central and South America
and in the Orient. The Philadelphia mu<
seum attempts to cover the entire world,
including countries that the Pacific Coast
has little hope to trade with. With thla
gigantic enterprise in hand the Phlladel
phians are not able to pay the attention
to the Pacific countries that is considered
necessary here. â¢ â¢
The instructions to the J*hiUppinÂ«
agent of the Commercial Museum will- go
forward by the next mail to Manila,

ntrcet communicatfon will in all prob
abilitv be established in the near future
between this port and Manila. The mer
chants'of this city have been striving for
months to attain this end. A committee
consisting of George A. Newhall. repre
senilae the Chamber of Commerce;
Gec:ge "\V, McXear of the Produce Ex
change, and Andrew J. Carrigan of the
San Frar.ci.3co Board of Trade was sent to
Washir.iston for the purpose of inducing
the adrnini-straticn to assist San Francisco ;
in securing a direct line of steamships |
with the islar.d possessions. The com- j
mittecmen arrived home last night after]
having seen the President and the mem- J
r-prs of the Cabinet. Although they were |
not prepared to announce to what extent j
concessions had been granted, they stated j
that their mission met with unexpected j
success. Â¦ . .
The President and his Ministers received I
the representatives of this city with great j
affability anil met them half way on every j
proposition they advanced for the better- j
mem of the coast trade. . ,
The Government ships great quantities
of supplies each month to the Philippines, t
and Hitherto this work has been per- ;
formed by the Government transports. It
was to induce the administration to as- r
sist in the establishment of a direct i
etcamship line by transferring a portion j
of the monthiv shipment of supplies to ]
a private lire that the committee was :
sent East. A strong plea was made on. i
behalf of the project on the ground that |
the carrying of the Government supplies :
on the Atlantic coast by private parties
has long been sanctioned and with con
siderable profit to the national treasury.
The committee was delighted with the
reception which they received at the
hands of the administration. Every cour- !
tesv Â¦was extended to them. In speaking j
of 'their mooting: with t'-Â« Prpsi<i^"t I
George A. Newhall said: "I never real
ized that McKinley possessed so magnetic
a personality or that he was so pleasant j
and agreeable. Everything: that we pro
posed for the improvement of the Pacific 1
Coast trade conditions was listened to
vith attention and granted as far as was
possible. In regard to the Western tour,
the people of New York consider it a wise
plan and believe that the country will be
benefited by it; but the people of Wash
ington, who regard the President as their
own personal property, do not look upon
it in the same snirit."

ANOTHER SLAVE
TO BE DEPORTED
United States Attorney
"Woodworth Wins
a Victory.
Jung Ling Heung Is Not Pro
duced and Bail May Be
Forfeited.
When the caseW Li Ah Yin, the slave
girl, was called yesterday in United States
Court Commissioner Heacock's chambers,
Attorneys Shortridge and " Boardman
asked for a continuance on the ground
that they had not been able to find the
five Chinese witnesses who, they had been
assured, would swear that the girl wa.Â»
born at No. 741 Dupont street.
'United States District Attorney Wood
worth opposed the motion for delay, xle
said that he would admit that the China
men, if present, . would testify as Mr.
Shortridge had said, but he wished It to
be understood explicitly that he did not
admit that such testimony would be the
truth.
Judge Heacock denied the motion to
continue the case, and announced that the
girl had failed to prove that she y as a
native of the United States, but that on
the contrary he was convinced that she
had been landed by fraudulent representa
tions and false testimony, and he would
therefore recommend her deportation.
The case of Jung Ling Heung, another
slave girl, was called in the afternoon,
but she did not appear. Messrs. Short
ridge and Boardman announced that the
Chinaman who had employed them as at
torneys in the case had telephoned that
he had secured other attorneys, and that
Srxrtridge and Boarflman were present
mtrely as a matter of courtesy to the
court.
The hearing was continued until 11
o'clock this forenoon. MK Woodworth no
tified the surety company and the backers
of the woman that if she failed to appear
the bonds of $3000 would be forfeited.
BEATS HIS CHILD WITH
A STRAP AND BUCKLE
One-Armed Vender of Newspapers
Inflicts a Severe Whipping on
His Daughter.
. May Burdick, a 14-year-old school girl.
who lives with her parents at 81 Rausch
street, will to-day at the instigation of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children swear out a warrant for the
arrest of her father, who brutally beat
her. The father is a one-armed vender
of newspapers and has an ungovernable
temper. He has taken a dislike to his
daughter and on every occasion, it is al
leged, has chastised her severely.
- On Sunday last he struck the girl over
the 'head with a strdp and the buckle at
tached to it cut a deep gash in her head.
He beat her unmercifully on the shoulders
and body and the marks of the blows are
still in evidence. The Humane Society
learned of the cruelty and yesterday re
moved the girl from her surroundings.
She. will be placed in. a good home. An

QUESTIONS SOUNDNESS OF
HYPPOLITE DUTARiyS MIND
Theklay D. Kleinclaus Files Contsst
to Decedent's Will and Makes
Various Charges.
A contest to the will of the late Hyp
polite. Dutard was filed yesterday by
Theklay D-utard Kleinclaus, decedent's
sister.
.Hyppolite Dutard died April 15, 1900,
leaving an estate valued at $2,500,000. On
April 18, 1900, decedent's will was offered
for probate. The will was dated March
4, 1900, and was accompanied by a codicil
bearing date of March 31, 1900.
This will and codicil, Mrs. Kleinclaus
alleges, were executed by the deceased. If
at all. while he was of unsound mind.
Divers persons, she alleges, also conspired
to secure- a will in their favor and, tak
ing advantage of Dutard's unsoundness
of mind and the fact that he was kept
under the influence of drugs and nar
cotics, they unduly influenced him to ex
ecute a will in their favor and against the
interests of the petitioner.
. Mrs. Kleinclaus is represented by At
torneys Knight & Heggerty. The contest
has been assigned to Judge Coff ey's de
partment for trial. -

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. ;
There Is a cure for dyspepsia. Sufferers !
who have tried noxious nostrums will j
probably be skeptical, but skepticism van* j
ishes when Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are i
tried. Whether the trouble Is dyspepsia of i
long standing, or merely a simple case of
indigestion, relief is prompt and pro-
nounced. The less the trouble the fewer
tablets need be taken.
Heaviness after eating, sour stomach,
as indicated . by belching, fatigue with
slight exertion, or with no exertion at all,
disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipation,
depression, "blues," these things can com-
monly be set down as symptoms of dys~
pepsia. And dyspepsia is merely indlges*
tlon in an aggravated form, l
By promotiaÂ«r perfect digestion, Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets produce strong nerves,
restful, refreshing sleep, pure blood and
good sound healthy flesh. They make the
skin clear, the eyes bright, the mind
cheerful. . -
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a medi-
cine and more than a medicine. iThey di-
gest the food and make it easy of assimi-
lation, and they relieve the Inflamed, dis-
eased condition of the membranous lin- I
ings and the glands of the stomach and
bowels. They help the digestive organs
over the hard places, and put them into a
healthy, a<5tlve condition. They; effect a
quick and permanent cure. -You don't
have to continue taking them forever, still
it is well to have a box handy and take
one at the first return of the trouble.
, Perfectly well people are mad6' sick by
eating too much, or unwholesome food,
but not if they take a tablet after eating.
Treatment with Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets does not r.ecessltate dieting or any
change of habita. They digest the proper
food and act upon the other kind In such
n way as to make it pass off quickly and
harmlessly. You may eat and drink what
you like, when you like, and as much as
you like if you take a tablet afterward.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are 'sold by
all druggists at 50 cents for full size pack-
age. â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢ . Â¦ Â¦ â¢ -

I caup-jd t>r a contracted disorder or early dlssl-
i pation. La looking: for the location of this dam-

I Inflamed prostate glaml. As this gland Is the
very center of the reproductive system it can

are promptly b^nente-l by proper treatment,
otherwise .the patient soes from bad to worse.
The essential point In all of them is the neces-
i Blty of the cure of the focus of the trouble In
the prostate. Many men have unsuccessfully
treated for a weakness and become discour-

Is entitled to a new schoolhouse, which

The Burnett and Sheridan schools should
be rebuilt, to cost about $160,000. For the
repair of some forty schools the sum of
$50,000 Is recuired."
Director Casserly suggested that, if

The Question of steam pressure is the
pivotal one. There was a strong ebb tide
at the time of the wreck, and Pilot Jor
dan's testimony indicated that there was
not a sufficiency of steam pressure on
the engines to overcome the outward cur
rent and that the vessel was thus allowed
to drift out of her course, which* if true,
would fix a certain measure of responsi
bility upon the chief engineer. On this
point Pilot Jordan swore that it occupied
fifty minutes for the Rio to make three

amount of steam carried by the Rio -de

was appointed from the eligible list.
O'Rourke lost his job on an adverse re
port filed by Charles Gallagher, superin

â¢who claimed that O'Rourke's work was
faulty. O'Rourke was given a public trial
by the Civil Service Commission and pro

Company; C. S. Harney, vice president of
the Union Paving and Contracting Com

respectively president and superintendent
of the old Metropolitan Railway Com

this view was taken by the commission.

Captain Bermlng-ham said that It was
not quite clear to him why Engineer Her
lihy should have suggested to the cap
tain concerning the setting of sea watches
during the night before the wreck.
"Didn't you feel it incumbent upon
you," asked Captain Bermingham, "to
have all hands below while coming In?"
Mr. Herlihy replied in the negative.
"It seems to me," continued Captain
Bermingham, "that you ought to have
had all hands down below. It would not
have hurt anything."
"It would not have done any good on
this occasion," remarked Attorney Hut
ton.
Captain Bermingham suggested that It
did not matter whether it would have
done any good or not.
Chief Engineer Herlihy testified that
there was sufficient steam pressure on for

Stanley says that even a "ground an
chor" in the shape of an attachment and
a deputy sheriff will not prevent him sail
ing through the clouds when the airship
is finished. Sheriff Lackmann Is wonder-
Ing how he will retain the vessel when the
"gas Is turned on."
Charles Stanley, who proposes to give
Count von Zeppelin a few pointers on
aerial navigation, has worked on the
plans of his ship for the past fifteen
years. He is a machinist and has studied
the subject of navigation in the air. He
interested a number of business men in
his plans and a company was incorporat
ed with $300,000 capital stock. Stanley held
200,000 shares, Charles Newman secured
21,000 and a few others invested in the cor
poration.
Newman stated yesterday that he has
great faith in the airship, but does not
like Stanley's methods of doing business.
"If Stanley Is forced out of the com
pany," said Newman, "we will go ahead
and finish the ehip. I had sufficient faith
in the plans to put in many thousand dol
lars, but I have lost my faith in the
methods of Stanley." -
Stanley Sanguine of Success.
Assistant Secretary Elmer' T, jFentress
was perfectly candid in discussing the
affairs of the Stanley Aerial Navigation
Company when seen yesterday.
"We have put in about $25,000 in the
building of the ship," he said, "and this
attachment will not stop its completion.
We have been delayed by the non-arrival
of a carload of aluminum and a shipment
cf Bilk from the East, otherwise we would
have had the ship ready for its trial as an
nounced. Newman drawing out of the
company has not affected us. He wanted
to boss the whole thing and Stanley would
not stand for It. We have only sold
enough stock to keep ua supplied with
funds to carry on the building of the ship.
We hoped to make *. sale this week of
some stock and were disappointed. We
owe our employes for last week, their
salaries amounting to about $400. With
this lumber bill and a few other trade ac
counts, we owe about $600. Now that is
not going to swamp us. We will get the
money to pay all our bills and the 'knock
ers'-will be surprised when they see the
airship is a complete success."
Internal Trouble In Company..
The airship company has been in trou*
ble for the past two weeks. First there
was a difference of opinion between
Charles Newman of the Richelieu Cafe
and Inventor Stanley. , Newman Invested
$7300 in airship stock. Newman was also
secretary of the aerial company and as
long as he held the position money waa
always In the treasury. Newman drew out
two months ago and sold the bulk of his
stock. He was succeeded by J, Albert
Born as secretary. A few weeks ago
more trouble loomed up for the company.
"W. Lu Harper, a stockholder, undertook to
sell some of his stock and Stanley claimed
that he had no right to do this. The re
sult was a lawsuit, which is now in the
courts. . '
Inventor Stanley and his associates .-were
not dismayed by the appearance of a dep
uty sheriff with a -vp-Jt of. attachment.
Work went on as usual at the old Velo
drome grounds on Baker street, and the
deputy of Sheriff J,ackmann learned a

The presence in great force of a widespread
public interest in the market must explain
this Ignoring of usual technical indication.
The great accumulations of wealth which have
come to the hands of the American people for
f everal years past and which have lain in de
posit banks waiting for Â¦ Opportunity for - out
lay . seemed to bs , pouring into Wall ? street,
attracted by the sudden great fortunes which
If any ordinary considerations could be the
rule in such a market the fact that the stocks
vere notably strong yesterday werf to-day sold
in enormous volume to take profits would have
had great influence. The sharp break at many
points In the closing: dealings would have been
another factor making for hesitation, but these
usual symptoms of a coming reaction- have
been so often without the slightest effect in
the recent extraordinary market that ( they
were totally ignored by the excited specula
tors, as many other incidents have been, such
as the engagements of gold for export and
occasional hardening of the money market.
NEW YORK. April 3O.-There Is no- prece
dent by which to be guided In the formation
of a Judgment regarding the present stock
market. Each day of trading leaves- some
former record behind and not infrequently all
previous records go by the board as a result
of a day's business. The aggregate "tales of
all stocks to-day went ahead of ytterday's
hitherto unprecedented total, rising to 3,202,100
shares. Last Wednesday's record sales of a
single stock were 662.000 shares for Union Pa
cific, compared with to-day's sales of 459,100
Ehares of United States Steel. The aggregate
tales of both the common and preferred stock
of United States Steel amounted . to-day to
648,000 shares. Another record was clipped to
day for a single hour's business, sales for the
first hour amounting to over a million shares,
against the previous maximum of less than
SOO.CCO shares. It is -the usual rule that a large
portion of a day's business on the exchange
is done during the first hour, but had the ac
tivity of the market for the rest of the day
continued In normal proportion to Â¦ the first
hour's business the total for the day would
have reached probably 4,000,000 shares, which
would mean .commislons of stock exchange
members for the day's business of a million
dollars. Such statistics as these convey the
truest idea of the dimensions and scope of the
present market. Any attempt . at description
would tesolve Itself largely Into an accumula
tion of superlatives. There were long strings
ct successive transactions inÂ» some of the most
active stocks to-day, in which none of the
sales reported were of less than 1C0 shares and
running from that up to 10,000 shares.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
CHICAGO, April 30.â The market opened
weak under depressing cables, for both spot
and futures.' Advices from the Continent were
that a great deal of wheat bought within
the last few days was "off ered for resale. The
bear situation was of brief duration, J how
ever. A large decrease in the world's visible
supply ' and a good cash demand caused a
sharp advance. Later heavy profit-taking
caused a reaction, but the close was easy.
July closed easy at 73Uc. May wheat closed
1 ri < 6%c lower at 75%c.
Corn opened weak on good weather, liberal
country offerings, lower cables and In sym
pathy with wheat. The local element was
the sole support of the market. . July closed
%c higher at 45%c. May closed firm, He high
er, at 4SVic.
Oats were strong In sympathy with corn.
May closed Vic higher at 26%c. July closed
unchanged at 26c.
Provisions were neglected, but nominally
steady. July pork closed 2>ic lower; lard and
ribs unchanged.

ports of damage to the crops In the south
west showed a tendency to Increase. There
was - no cash demand, though 150,000 bushels
were worked for export. New York was offer
ing to resell, which was a bad sign. At the
close, however, the shorts became the best
buyers. The world's supply, according to
Bradstreet's. showed a decrease east of the
Rockies of .2,631,000 bushels, and a decrease
in Europe- and afloat of 700,000 bushels, .mak

The report of A. G. McAdle. section director
of the climate and -crop section of the Weather
Bureau, fcr the week ending Monday, Is a*
follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature has been below normal
most of the week and severe frosts have oc
curred In some sections. Dry northerly winds
continued until Saturday, when brisk south
and southeast winds prevailed In the central
end northern portions of the State. Rain com
menced early Sunday morning In the northern
districts, extending southward and continuing
through Sunday and Monday, with prospects
of reaching Southern California to-day or to
night. . ..
In some parts of the State the latt *own
grain has suffered from the long dry spell to
such an extent that It will not make a crop
and will be cut for hay. In other sections
the rain will probably be In time to make a
fair crop. Early grain is generally in good
condition, except in portions of Southern Cali
fornia, and will yield nearly an average crop;
it has been greatly benefited by the rain. A
large crop of excellent hay is being harvested.
Vegetables have been injurd by frosts during
the week in some sections. Hops are looking
well.
Deciduous fruit prospects are not as good
as at this time last week, the severe frosts
of the 26th and 27th having seriously Injured
nearly all varieties In many parts of the coast
end bay sections. In some places apricots
alone escaped Injury. Grapes were also con
- t: Jerably damaged in some sections. In the
Sacramento Valley and In portions of South
ern California there will be nearly an average
yield of deciduous fruits. Citrus fruits and.
walnuts are in good condition.
SACRAMENTO VALLEYâ Cold northerly
winds continued until Saturday. Rain began
falling early Sunday morning, extending
throughout the valley. At Sacramento the
precipitation up to a o'clock this morning
amounted to 1.76 inches, and at Red Bluff 1.04.
. This rain will be of Immense benefit to all
crops, especially to grain and hay, and will
revive pasturage. The long dry spell has been'
detrimental to the 1b ?â¢ "own grain, but it is
r.ow believed a fair crop will be harvested.
Early grain is in good condition. Fruit trees
Â¦rill also be benefited by the rain. Late re
ports show that nearly all varieties of de
ciduous fruits are in good condition and that
the damage by April frosts will not materially
reduce the crop. Grapes are looking well.
Cherries and strawberries are plentiful. The
first carload of cherries was shipped from
Vacavllle on the 25th.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONSâ The rainfall
of Sunday and to-day, which was heavy In
the central and northern counties, will great
ly improve the condition of grain, hay and
pr-eturage. and benefit orchards and vineyards.
Late sown grain in some sections was In very
bad condition and may yield only a light crop,
but the early sown had net suffered much for
lack of rain and will yield a good crop. Hay
is yielding a heavy crop. The severe frosts on
the 26th and 27th seriously damaged deciduous
fruits and grapes In the Santa Clara Valley
and In Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
Apricots were so far advanced that but little
injury was done, but cherries, prunes, plums,
&nd pears were badly injured and the crop
will be very light. Grapes in some sections
were also damaged.
SAX JOAQULN* VALLEY-Clear and cool
weather with drying northerly wind has pre
vailed during the week. The cool weather has
been beneficial to the grain crop in modifying
the effect of the north wind. Rain was great
ly needed in all sections for both grain and
fruit, but the crops were standing the dry
weather better than was expected. The rain
of Sunday evening and Monday warping.
which covered the northern portion of the -val-.
ley. will be of the greatest benefit to all crops.
Reports as to the condition of the grain, crop
vary in different portions of the valley. The
lruit crop !n most places is <JoinÂ«? well, ex
cept prunes, which are falling l>adlyÂ» and will
only be a fair crop In a few localities. Haying
is progressing and the crop wllj be good ta
most places. The onion crop In San joaquia
County, which is now being harvested, will be
the largest ever grown. Green feed is etJIt
abundant and stock of all kind* are doing
well. Vineyards and orchards arÂ» belr.ff irri-
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-Neariy normal
weather conditions have prevailed during the
week, with fogs at nlsht along the coast and
I generally clear day?. The fogs have been bene
ficial to grain and hay. Late sewn grain is in
l;ad condition and will not make a crop. The
early town will yield a fair crop in some sec
tions. Haymaking is progressing, with a
heavy yield and of excellent quality. Sugar
l.eetf need rain. Walnuts are lcoKing well.
In the vicinity of Santa Maria apricots have
been seriously damaged by frosts, which have
lÂ»een frequent during the week.
EUREKA SUMMARYâ Heavy frost Thursday
morning throughout the valley practically
ruined prunes and severely Injured cherries,
quinces, peaches and pears; also greatly dam
aged grain. Pastures and gardens much bene
fit*-d by rain.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARYâ Bean land ready
in some sections for planting. Farmers In other
sections waiting for rain to prepare ground
for beans and corn. Haying continues. Rain
now would do as much harm as good.

All anxiety about "the coming Prune season
has disappeared. Reports from all districts
point to such a reduced yield this year that
even buyers admit that even If considerable of
last year's crop be carried over there will be
a good market, as every Prune will be needed.
One authority writes up from San Jose that
the Santa Clara crop will not exceed 20 per
cent of last year's yield.
Apricots, Apples and Peaches continue in
good demand, and Moorpark Apricots are said
to be cleaned up. . Peaches are also cleaning
up, and Apples are actually scarce. The

not moved at all this year.

In the tour of the country being made by
President McKinley, Irving M. Scott gave
his. approval to the plans of amalgama
tion. Some of those who have promoted
the deal were desirous of having a bond
issue, but to this Scott would not con
sent. He Insisted and _ others met hla
views. Scott then named a representa
tive, who participated in the meeting held
to-day, when the preliminary agreement
was signed.^ Â¦ .
For more than a year plans have been,
maturing for this amalgamation of ship
building interests. The deal would have
been closed long ago had Jt not been for
attempts of other companies to force
their way into the combination. Those
most interested were determined to- so or
ganize as to avoid the appearance of a
"trust" and to make stifling of competi
tion impossible. Their purposes have been
accomplished. An organization has been
effected which is expected to benefit the
yards concerned and the men employed
therein. ' .
Capital sufficient for the enterprise is
already aeeured. In order that outside
influence may not obtain control it has
been provided that no bonds be' issued.
Capital stock amounting to $70,000,000 will
be issued and a syndicate has already
been formed to underwrite the entire
amount. H. E. Huntingdon, nephew of
the late Collis P. Huntington, it is said,
Is to.be the president of the new concern.

Miss Frasee knew that something must
be done quickly if the child's life were to

structions to bring whisky, she seated the
child by the side of the road and applied
her lips to the wound to suck the poison
from the veins. . She was evidently suc
cessful, for the poison did not seem to
take immediate effect on the child. When
the father arrived the lad was thoroughly
dosed with whisky, which counteracted
the snake's venom and supplemented the
work so well done by the teacher. . . .
The child was hurried to Oceanside, be

Laborers' Protective. Union.
.In order to bring about a settlement of
the difficulties between the men engaged
in the affiliated iron industries the em
i ployers had a -conference yesterday at 320
1 Post street with an employe from each
shop which will be effected' by the new
schedule of price3 demanded and which
will go into effect on May 20. Every ef
fort was made to keeo the results of the
meeting secret. But the utterances of em
ployers and of the men who attended in
dicate that the situation is strained de
spite the date set for the enforcement of
the demand is nearly three weeks away.
Just what developed at the. conference
and what tho results may be none pres
ent would say. With double-locked doors
the members of the, Iron Trades Council,
as the foundrymen, ship builders and al
lied trades ere known, discussed the situ
ation and decided that they would not
give in. ' â¢ Â¦ ' -. â¢'
This determination was reached after a
long and acrimonious debate. After the
meeting: opened the representatives of
each shop, accompanied .. by Secretary
Wlsler of v the International Machinists',
Association, were called in and an' hour
was spent in discussing the situation. The
grievances of the men were explained; the
employers also had their say, and then the
Â¦workmen. were sent out Into the rain.
â¢After an hour's further deliberation the
employers went away. As they came -from
the hall they were "loud in their protesta
tions against granting the demands of tho
men, which mean -a shortening of the
day of labor to nine hours and an Increase
of wages by 12^ per cent. It is not prob
able that any refusal of this demand will
be made in writing or that any action will
be taken by the employers in advance:
They will simply await the action of thÂ«
employes. , _ â¢Â¦ - /
According to Irving M. Seotf of the
Union Iron Works all differences will. be
arranged before the date set for putting,
the new schedule into effect:
. "Any reasonable demands the men may
make,'" says Mr. Scott, "will be carefully
considered and adjusted. As far, as, any
strike before May 20 is concerned, we do
not anticipate it.; Our. relations are har
monious, so far, and - the Ohio will be
launched at the time set,"

MEN OF NOTE
ARE INJURED
IN A WRECK
"There was room In the quarters on the
Copack for only about half of the men,"'
says Hennessy. "The rest were compelled
to sleep in the horse stalls between deckp.-
The galley where our food was prepared
was next to useless. At Nagasaki our or
ders were changed and as we only had
khaki suits we suffered a great deal from
the cold. No arrangements were made on
the boat for drinking or wash water for
the men. We managed to steal or buy cr
beg drinking water from the Chinese cook
and went without washing. The digni
tary also sold the men- at exorbitant
prices food from the cabin ir.ess. Those
of us who had some money left managed
to live in this way, but it was no consola
tion to these who had none."
These facts arc made public by P. Hen
nessy, one of the passengers, and verified
by others. Hennessy went to the Philip
pines last fall as a Government packer
and served until March of this year. He
had a contract with the Government, un
der which he was to be given transporta
tion and subsistence to the place of his
enlistment, provided he served a' year.
As he was released upon his own request
he was given transportation without sub
sistence, a t^rm which when applied to
a thirty-day voyage seems something of
a contradiction, as the only way in "which
a man could make such a voyage with
out subsistence would be In an embalmed
state.
The food, they allege, was insufficient
in quantity and improperly prepared. A
civilian cook was employed, but no prop
er provisions -were made in the way of
utensils for him to use. Instead of hav
ing a regular galley stove, only a small
cook stove was provided. Many of the
men were given transportation without
subsistence and expected to provide S for
themselves before they started. Some
were una';!e to do so, while others had
their provisions stolen or got an insuffi
cient quantity. For there the officers
doled out enough in the way of rations
to prevent starvation, charging the men
jvith the issue., Upon the arrival of the
shJp here an attempt was made to col
lect the expense account, but the men re
fused to pay; i Some of them were de
tained on the *hip for some time, many
of them stealing ashore and swiding their
baggage off by their comrades who were
more fortunate. â¢ *Â¦.': Â¦-Â¦Â¦':
Among the indignities to which they
were subjected was that of being, com
pelled to sleep in horse stalls, without
ether accommodation, than their own
blanket for protection against the cold.
This would not have been a serious mat
ter had the vessel gone the southern
route to San Francisco, as she was or
dered to do upon -her departure from
Manila: but at Nagasaki the orders, were
changed and the vessel directed to come
to Taccma. Th.e northern route is colder
and consequently the men suffered. They
declare that no arrangements were made
for their cleanliness and they were com
pelled to make the entire voyage with
out more than one opportunity to bathe.
TACOMA. April 30.â The seventy dis
charged soldiers and Government em
ployes, who returned from Manila recent
ly on the transport Copack, now being
dismantled here, are loud in their de
nunciation of the alleged carelessness
v.'ith which the vessel was managed on
the trip and declare that they were mis
treated, neglected and allowed to go hun
gry during the gTeater portion of the
voj'age.

At 12:30 o'clock another clerk returned,
to find the office door wide upen, the lock

was gained with a chisel or other flat in
strument about an inch wide, while the
desk lock had been -forced in a similar
manner. The police and detective depart
ments of Lo3 Angeles and Pasadena are
at work on the case and while they have
what they believe are good clews they
have made no arrests.
The office of the railway company is on
the second floor of the First National Bank
building-, at the corner of Colorado street
and Fair Oaks avenue, the busiest awt
hi the city. The place was practically de-
Eerted to-day because of the rainstorm
and the thief had iio trouble in making
h!s way from the building without at
tracting attention. Whoever committed
the deed must have been familiar with
the habits of the auditor and his deputies,
as the office seldom is left unoccupied
during the day and it is onlv at certain
hours that any considerable" amount of
cash is on hand. The office force con
sists of the auditor, and five assistants,
most of whom, with the exception of Hitt,
are old employes.
PASADENA, April 30.â A bold daylight
robbery In the heart of the city to-day
depleted the treasury of the Los Angele3
and Pasadena Railway Company by $2500
in goid and bank notes. The money was
in charge of H. I. Chatfleld, auditor of
the company, who just before goins to
luncheon at 12 o'clock had checked yes
terday's receipts and was to take "the
money to Los Angeles this afternoon for
deposit. He placed the cash in a drawer
of his roll-top desk, which he locked, and
left H. H. Hitt, a clerk, in sole possession
of the office. Hitt left the place five min
utes later, locking the office door with a
spring- lock.

LATE SHIPPING INTEZXIGENCE.
A programme of work lor the four days
was adopted and other routine business
was transacted. Dr. Carrie I* Roe of this
city welcomed the convention to Pacific
Grove in an appropriate address and Mrs.
Alice M. Bowman of Corralitos respond
ed on behalf of the delegates. Mra. S. J.
Dorr, the president, read her annual mes
sage. .
Three addresses characterized the work
of the evening session. The first, by Pro
fessor R. I*. Sandwick, principal of the
Pacific Grove High School, was upon the
"Co-operation of Home and School In the
Life of a Child." It dealt with the close
interdependence of the two Influences in
making or marring a child's life and the
reasons why parents should co-operate
with teachers 'n all points for their chil
dren's physical and mental development
Mrs. Annie Little Barry of San Francisco,
recording secretary of the California
Women's Christian Temperance Union,
followed with an address upon the same
subject, treating It from the standpoint of
a parent. Mrs. F. M. Holston of Watson
vifle delivered the third address of the
evening, which was along the same gen
eral line as the preceding ones, its sub
ject being "Scientific Temperance Instruc
tion."
A pleasing feature of the evening: was a"
children's- patriotic rally under the direc
tion of. Miss Ktta B. Lloyd- of Pacific
Grove. About fifty children, dressed en
tirely in white and bearing small Amer
ican flags, went through a number of ef
fective drills and sang patriotic songs.
The evening closed with a reception to the
tri-county officers and delegates, given by
the local Women's Christian Temperance
Union.

non-participation of the French In the

PARIS, April 3O.-The Foreign Office
has received a dispatch from Mengtse an
nouncing the arrival there of M. Fran
cois, the French Consul, on his return to
his post. M. Francois says that, according
to the demands of the French Govern
ment, he was met by Chinese troops ten
kilometers from* Mengtse, who rendered
honors and high mandarins uroffered the
official apologies and regrets of the Chi
nese Government for the events of last
June. .
The French consular party under M.
Francois was attacked Juno 10 on leaving
Yunnanfu, and was forced to return to
the town. All the baggage was rifled and
the missions and buildinsrs were burned.
M. Francois gathered his countrymen at
his' residence and defended the place with
rifles. The Francois party was allowed to
start for Tonauin June 24 under, the pro
tection of the Viceroy of Yunnan.

Official Apologies for the Attack on
Dr. Reid Is seeking the man's execu

by the American policy. He claims that
the Americans should have declined to
administer the section of Peking if they
were not willing to mete out justice as
determined by the International Commis
sion, on which the Americans have a
representative.
A noted Boxer chief who made hH
headquarters in the American section and
who was guilty of killing or ordering to
be killed nearly fifty persons, including
an associate of the Rev. Gilbert Reid in
the International Institute, has been
transferred to the Chinese Board of Pun
ishment to be dealt with, as General
Chaffee, under orders from Washington,
refused to order a death punishment. It
is feared *hat in this case the Chinese
plenipotentiaries will not order the be
heading of the culprit unless pressed, aa

PEKING, April 30.â Nine robbers, who'.
were caught in the section controlled by
the American troops, were beheaded yes
terday. It was stated that this action
was not taken by order of General Chaf
fee, but was inflicted by the Chine3e
Board of Punishment through instruc
tions received from Li Hung Chang and
Prince Ching. the peace envoys. The ac
tion is generally received with satisfac

SAN DIEGO, April 30.â Miss E. M. Cha
pin, the devisee under the will of Thomas
Potter, was the principal witness in the
will contest to-day. Potter died here sud
denly last Thanksgiving day, leaving all
of his property to Miss Chapin, who was
his fiancee. William Potter, an adopted
son, is the contestant, and the property
involved is the. townsite of Seahaven, in
Washington. '
Miss Chapin told of her acquaintance
with Potter. She was introduced by Mr.
Gough, a tourist, and Mr. Potter took her
out frequently on excursions and picnics
to nearby points of interest. He proposed
marriage three or four months after their
first meeting.
; It was on a Sunday night, when they
were returning .from church, that Po*t
ter brought up the subject by saying that
there was a certain woman in San Diego
of whom he thought a great deal and be
would like the assistance of Miss Chapin
in winning her for his wife. Miss Chapin
replied that she could not help him as
long as she did not know who" the woman
was, whereupon Mr. Potter said: "You're
the one." Miss Chapin said it was very
sudden and that she was taken by sur
prise. She did not give an answer then,
stating that she would have to consider
the problem for a few days. She told
him, however, that she had a very high
regard for him. After thinking over the
matter for a week she accepted the pro
posal. At that time he said nothing about
a will, but later he said he would make
a new one and remember her in it. .
The day before he died he handed her
a will which bequeathed practically all of
his property to her. In relating to her
the story of his life' he said there had
been a slight misunderstanding between
his son and himself over the division â¢of
property owned by the Seahaven Com
pany In .Washington when that concern
went out of existence. The company
owned 700 acres of land at Seahaven. The
son took about 600 acres and Mr. Potter
was given less than 100 acres. The latter
did not believe a fair division was made.
William Potter, the son, claims to have
advanced $20,000 to his father, but does
not know what the father did with it. .

BERLIN. April 3O.-The Lokal Anzeiger

says:
.. An extensive. Nihilist plot has-been dis

arrests were made to-day, of which num
ber 200 were transported by special train
to the Warsaw citadel. The towns of
Sosnivico, Sielce and Dombrowa have
been occupied by two companies of Cos
sacks. Secret correspondence was dis
covered at Sielce by which the plot was
revealed. * â \
PARIS, April 30.â A dispatch to Le Solr
says that the plot was discovered in
"Warsaw and that ramifications of the
conspiracy exist among all classes of
Polish societies, and especially among the
workmen. Among the 600 arrests made
since last night, there are several highly
placed personages. L i â¢â¢".

SEATTLE, April 30.â A curious, state of
affairs has arisen over the resolution of
the County Commissioners to burn a house
that is infected with smallpox: The house
is near Maltby and is inhabited by a lum
berman named Alvin Butler, with a large
family. Five of the family have been suc
cessively stricken with the disease and
placed In a. temporary hospital. ?"-; :.:
Alter the fourth was attacked the Coun
ty Commissioners resolved to burn the
house and prevent further spread of the
contagion. Butler, however, valiantly de
fended his hearth and the men were dis
comfited. No further attempt was made
to destroy the house until the fifth child
was stricken with thÂ» disease. Then a
Deputy Sheriff was sent to see that the
house were burned to the ground. Butler
appeared with a formidable looking shot
gun and the razing of his log cabin was
indefinitely postponed. The deputy was
soon back in Seattle. '
The affair was lost sight of until yester
day, when word came that another young
ster was sufferjng from the smallpox. To
day the County Commissioners determined
to be resolute. They applied to the Prose
cuting Attorney to see how far they might
proceed. Upon his opinion will depend
their next movement.
The house belongs to the Maltby Mill
Company, which employs Butler in the
mill. The company desires that the house
be burned. Â¦ but Butler is opposed to that
scheme. He has been discharged from the
mill, but declares he does not care, as he
will have more time to stay at home and
defend his residence.
Memorial Committee Meets.
The Memorial day committee met yes
terday afternoon in the Mayor's office for
the purpose of preparing a fitting cele
bration for the coming 30th of May. It
Â¦was decided to make a special effort to
have the exercises as impressive as pos
sible. A parade will be held and all the
posts of the G. A. R. will be /invited to
participate with their united strength.
The committee, which is composed of
General - Shafter (chairman), T. C. Mas
tellar (vice chairman) and Frank C.
Drady (secretary) will meet again next
Friday in the Mayor's office to prepare a
programme for the occasion.

When tired of experimenting In other lines
or investment, do yourself a kindness by in-
vestigating the merits of the Montezuma Mln^
Ing Company. "With its 24 copper mines and
2000 acres of coal land, with ample timber and
water, its proximity to the seaboard, and
other advantages, which are fully set forth
in the prospectus, the Montezuma offers op-
portunity for money making that stands un-
equaled on this Coast to-day. In our adver-
tising of these great properties, and In pros-
pectus and reports as Â¦well, only the simple
unvarnished truth has been told. Examina-
tion of the properties will prove that we could, I
with safety, have made much stronger state-
ments. We offer to investors the privilege of
examining these properties at our expense.
Our special train will leave San Francisco for
the mines in Washington June 13 next. Any- I
body may go, whether he be stockholder or
not. Our excursion folder tells all about the
trip. Tee prospectus tells something about th*Â»
mines. Both may be had on application.
For the purpose of hastening development
during the summer, the price of the stock will
until May 5 be kept at the present low prlca
of 10c a share cash or 12c? on monthly install-
ments. "We invite correspondence with pros-
pective investors, big and little.

AUDITOR BEFUSES TO
.-. SIGN BAIL OBDEHS
His Attorney Advises That He Has
Nothing to Do With the
Demands. .
Auditor wells received an opinion yes
terday frejjM his legal adviser, Reuben H.
Lloyd, In which the latter advises him
that deiaandB for bail moneys should not
go through, his office. In accordance with
the opinion Wells states that he will not
audit,. such demands. The result will be
That thousands of dollars will remain tied
up in the city treasury until such time
as mandamus proceedings are brought by
.some interested depositor.
In his opinion Mr. Lloyd dissents from
that filed by City Attorney Lane, who held
that demands for bail moneys must pass
through the Auditor's hands. The opin
ion reviews the creation by the charter of
a special fund in which are placed all
moneys paid into court and deposited with
the Treasurer or County Clerk, and these
are held to be subject to the order of the
court alone. The opinion gays:
I regret I cannot concur with the opinion
cf the City and County Attorney. 1*1x1011 holds
It is your, duty to audit all demands upon the
Treasurer, including therein special deposits
of bail money. It appears to mÂ«, in 'speaking
of '-demands," thai the charter clearly means
demands upon money belonging to . the city
and county and demands aratast the t.-ity and
county on money said into ths city and
county treasury fcr the use or beoeSt or to be
disposed of by the city and county. Bail jnoney,
when ceDcsited in the treasury, does not be
long to the city Â¦and county, nor is it disposed
of by the city and county; it is only upon the
happening of some future continsBtjcy - that
the city may be Interested therein.
The ccurt must pass upon whether cr not the
fcail has been forfeited and thenâ and not .till
then â has the depositor lost his title, to it.
The charter gives the Police Judges of ; thin
city the same poirer that the State law gives
to Justices of the Peace, and these regutate

The twelve counties f embraced in the
membership of the* Sacramento - Valley
Development Association are engaged in
ascertaining whether they will go. on for
another year. The probability is that they
will continue to keep together for the good
of all. So says F. E. Wright, who repre
sents the- association in this city at the
headquarters of the State Board of
Trade. Still the proposition before the
several counties of the Sacramento Valley
is sufficiently interesting to Â¦ attract the
attention of the counties in other parts of
the State that have been organized to mUr
tually advance the common interest. Last
year, according: to Mr. "Wright, the several
Sacramento Valley counties contributed'
equally to carry on the valuable work of
making the valley known, to the world, as
much as possible. This year a different
basis has been :ecommen4ed by a commit
tee consisting of J. O. Coleman. F. B.
Wright and W. S. Green. It has been
concluded to ask for contributions In ac
cordance with the assessed valuations of
the respective counties. For instance.
Sacramento County will be asked to con
tribute $S55 â¬6. while Ycba County will he
asked for only $137 S2 as its share of the
annual expense of keeping up the associ
ation. The basis proposed is 2^ cents on
each $1000 assessed valuation. â¢ â¢ . ..
The existence of the association depends
only on the raising of $3500. Upon raising
that sum depends the work of attracting
the attention of Eastern visitors to Ss-n
Francisco and to the northern counties,
through the agency of the representative
kept at the State Board of Trade offices.
Mr. Wright says that the man who !s as
sessed to be worth $1000 will be asked
practically for a postage stamp, while the
one assessed for $10,000 will have only to
contribute two bits. What will he done
<-annot be known until the matter comes
hefore the Supervisors of the twelve
northern counties. The Sacramento Val
ley counties pioneered the way In keeping
sn agent constantly at the State Board of
Tra.de for the purpose of supplying in
formation to inquirers, and still holds that
field of advantage alone.

COUNTIES FACE
MONEY PROBLEM
THE trust clause In the will at the
late James G. Fair was yesterday
declared Invalid by a majority of
the Supreme Court Justices sit
Â¦ ting in bank, with the result that
the estate of the dead millionaire will now
pas=s into the hands of his three children,
Theresa. Virginia, and Charles. Â«
The Supreme Court reverses itself on its
previous decision in the case, owiue: to
JuFtice Henshaw admitting that he was
In error when he upheld the view that the
trust clause of the will was a valid one.
When James G. Fair died his estate was
valued at $15,000,000. while it is to-day es
timated to be worth $20,000,000. . The deci
sion of the Supreme Court thus gives Mrs.
Herman Oelrichs. Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt
and Charles L. Fair fortunes amounting
to almost 5?.000,000 each.
The will of James G. Fair, when offered
for- probate by Angus, Crothers and
Goodfellow. tne -executors and trustees,
vac opposed by Charles L. Fair, the son
of the dead mining magnate. By a .spe
cial clause in the will it provided that any
of the legatees who contested the | will
should be cut off from any benefit in the
estate, his or her share to go to the other
legatees and beneficiaries.
Charles L. Fair fought, his father's .will,
despite. the fact that disinheritance, might
be his lot in the fight. His sisters, how
ever, joined issue with him by a -private
arrangement, and if Charles L. Fair had
been worsted in the fight for his father's
many millions he would have been pro
vided for by Mrs. Oelrichs and Mrs. Van
derbilt.
Charles L. Fair had two good grounds
for contesting his father's will. With his
two sisters he was only to receive the
income of the vast estate left by James
G. Fair. The estate was practically left
in the hands of Angus, Crothers and
Goodfellow. the trustees, and Charles L.
Fair's children, if any, were in no case to
The contention of 'the trustees that
James G. Fair really intended that his
children should have a "devise" in the
estate is dealt within very plain lan-
As to Intended Bevisel
But counsel ! for appellant contend that al
though the trust to convey be held void still
the will, upon various suggested theories, ought
to be construed as devising estates in remain
der to persons of the designated classes.
The case would have been different if there
had been an independent devise followed by a
direction- to the trustee, to convey to the dev
isees; in that case the words of. devise would
have created an estate, . and . the conveyance
would have been unnecessary, except perhaps
as convenient and additional evidence of title.
The Justices then explain' the provisions
of the Civil Code, which expressly forbid
the formation of a trust, -as in trie Fair
will, and many - decisions - are quoted to
show that the Fair trust is illegal. - â¢-
To explain this contention the decision
further says: / â¢ ,
In determining whether or not the trusts de
clared in the fifteenth clause are valid the
primary . and most important consideration â¢ is
that an express trust to convey real property
to beneficiaries is not lawful under the stat
utes of this State, but is, by such statutes,
forbidden. .
"Dees clause 15 of the will create an ab
solute trust or does It create only a power
in trust? Did James G. Fair vest his es
tate in the three trustees' or did he intend
that they should simply be trustees to
convey the property to the heirs of the
dead man?" .
The majority of the Justices, in spite of
their decision, believe that James G. Fair
did absolutely and positively intend that
the estate should pass .to the trustees and
that he made no "devise" to his heirs or
to any beneficiaries. After quoting the
famous "trdst clause" of the will the de
cision at once comes to the real issue by
saying:
Yesterday Justice Henshaw joined the
former minority, thus giving the estate of
James G. Fair to his heirs. .
The principal points discussed in the de
cision were as follows:
Judge Slack, in the Superior Court, de
clared the trust created by the will to be
invalid. The Supreme Court on appeal
four months ago reversed Judge Slack
and held that the trust clause was a valid
one.- At that time the Justices in favor of
the trust clause were Henshaw, Harrison,
Temple and Chief Justice Beatty, Jus
tices Garoutte. Van Dyke and McFarland
holding that the trust was invalid. A re
hearing was then granted.

versed the .decision of Judge
Slack of the Superior Court. A
rehearing was granted to the
children of the late Senator.
The decision whereby the court
reverses itself was made pos

Â¦was not prepared to, say -what the plans
of Mrs. Craven's Â¦ attorneys would be, -but
that- he 'thoug-ht; his .client's legal position
was vastly 1 1mproved by the Â¦; decision- of
yesterday. ; He ] explained ' this , by â¢ stating
that the chlldren'of James G.'i Fair. would
be more likely to effect a compromise with
Mrs. J Craven than the trustees might have
done, : f qr '. the Â¦ reason that Â¦ they,* the I chil
dren of ; the ;Â¦ late Senator Fair, would Â¦ be
most i anxious . to 'Â¦Â¦ clear, the Â¦; titles ' of . the
A-ast estate ! and ; secure a speedy division'
of it: - .... / ; . Â¦Â¦ .. _ .
'' Justices Harrison and Temple, together
with Chief .Justice Beatty; filed special
dissenting, opinions, similar In -detail "to
those they wrote at the previous hearing
of the famous will case. '
"The error of this opinion came from a failure
to give due recognition to the fact emphasized .
and demonstrated upon the last argument, that
only in those cases where a trust to convey la
valid, or in those cases like ; New York, where
its purpose : is effectuated by an enabling
statute as Â¦ a power , in - trust. Has this rule or
doctrine - ever . been , declared. The Legislature
has t prohibited a . trust ..- to convey.- It has de
clared : such ' a trust to be void. It has forbid
den the separation of the equitable from the le
gal interest by this . mode. - and a court can' no
more say. that Â¦ the equitable estate under such
a 'void trust -passes to the beneficiaries than it
can say that the legal estate passes. to the
trustees.- -Such, I think, is -the unanswerable
argument . in every - Jurisdiction where, as with
us, Â¦ a " trust Â¦ to Â¦ convey is prohibited and de
clared void, by express law. f â¢Â¦
Justice Henshaw wrote a special concur
ring opinion, in which he gives his reasons
for changing his, views as to the validity
of the trust will. He explains that in his
previous opinion he had no doubt of . the
intention of the testator to create a "trust
to convey," and that the provisions of the
will could be sustained. He adds:
i The decision was written by Justice G&
routte and concurred in' by Justices Van
Dyke arid McFarland.- .

to- transfer, and convey to certain of his kin
dred: that -his intention to so place the fee
stands out -plainly from the. face of the entire
will : ; that no contrary intention whatever ap
pears therefrom, and that the will 'must fall by
reason of this prohibited trust. ' We are morÂ»
satisfied with this result, when It is considered
that a contrary conclusion would perpetuate a
trust of this .vast estate, probably for a period
of fifty years or more, and- also result in a dis
inheritance of 'Fair's children. Notwithstand

Owing to an unfortunate error, the
statement -was made in The Call yester
day that Mrs. Mary Atkins Lynch, -thÂ«
founder of Benicia. College, the first
school established for women on this
coast, would speak "at the celebration of
founders' day at Mills College, Alameda,
on Saturday next. , _ '
The publication in question in The Call
â¢was based on a circular sent out by the
faculty of the college and nothing in
the information sent out. showed that
Mrs. Atkins died some years ago. The
wording of the circular was such that
it was to be inferred that Mrs. Atkins
Lynch was- still living and, owing to the
lateness of the hoQr when the circular
reached The Call editorial rooms, it was
impossible to make special inquiry on
the subject. -

At a meeting of the Dewey Monument
General Committee, which was held yes
terday, it was decided to return all the
designs and models which had been of
fered for consideration and to commence
all over again on entirely different lines.
Of ali the designs which were offered by
Eastern" sculptors and the models offered
by the local talent but one approached the
requirements of the committee. It was
furnished by Sculptor Brewster of New-
York. "When, ho was called upon to elab
orate his designs, the enlarged produc*
tion did not meet with favor." Hence the
present decision:
The committee will not call for any more
designs, but has commissioned Newton J.
Thorp, a local architect, to construct a
monument In accordance with plans which
it will furnish. When the architectural
feature of the monument has been com
pleted local sculptors will be chosen ' to
complete the decorations. Each sculptor
will be allowed to furnish that portion of
the work which he is best capable of pro
ducing.
The committee desires to have erected a
monument not to exceed $35,000 in cost and
to have a column effect. At the base are
to be four buttresses supporting figures of
heroic size, one of which is to be a Cali
fornia bear, emblematic of the State. It
will be .surmounted by a feminine figure,
representing Victory and will have bronze
tablets, illustrating the victory at Manila
Bay. The Park Commissioners have
granted permission to have the monument
erected in. Union Square. Work will be
commenced immediately.
It is hoped to have the work so far ad
vanced when President McKlnley arrives
in the State that he may be invited to re
move the first spadeful of earth for the
foundation. ' ' â¢
At the meeting yesterday the Park Com-
mlssioner* werÂ© represented by Reuben H.

members of the general committee who
were present were: Mayor Phelan. Colo

rights of the legalhelrs to whom the law'glves

v The ; court -holds that Judge Slack -was
right . in deciding that the . invalid trust
to convey carries with 1 it the otherwise
valid trust for the lives of the testator's
children, and 'that therefore the whole
trust fails. It also holds that it was the
manifest intention of James G. Fair that
none of his property should go to either
of his children, or to any other persons
as heirs -. at law. It holds that he Intend
ed,'through, the devise to the trustees and
anticipated conveyance by, them, to dis
pose of the temporary income of the es
tate to his children during their lives.
In ' closing the decision, the : court rules
that the very terms of the "trust clause"
positively vest the estate in the trustees"
and that tho children Â¦ of /James G. -Fair
could not : secure- possession of the prop
erty except by the "route provided in the
will.y.. The decision continues:

Tying Up Property Discouraged.
The comment of counsel for the trus
tees on a large number of New York de
cisions on trusts brings forth. the follow
ing caustic remark from the Justices in
their decision: Â¦
In these cases, the examples of former writ
ers on uses, trusts, powers and estates are
followed. The writers were wont , to Indulge
very fully in abstruse learning and | to use
language of rather an Indefinite and ambigu
ous characterâ somewhat after the methods of
the metaphysicians.
The claim of the trustees that though
the "trust to convey" be void under the
laws yet it should le considered merely
iis a. use executed by the English statute
of uses, as laid dow.. In the time of Henry
VIII, vol. 27. chap. 10. is treated by the
Supreme Court at considerable length.
The Justices enter into the history of the
foundation of the United States, where
many of the laws of England were adopt
ed by the new . colonies. The decision of
Norrls vs. Norris, 5 Cal.. 253. laid down
the rule that there is no presumption that
the' common law itself exists except â¢ as
expressly declared by the constitutions
and statutes of such States. Continuing
the Justices in their decision say:
Such. common law .'prevails only as far as it
Is not repugnant -to or inconsistent with the
constitution or laws of this State.
Then quoting the sections of the Civil
Code of California which do not agree
with thA. English law on uses the de
cision says: \ ;
Indeed, 1 the I English statute of uses is re
pugnant .to our whole system of conveyances,
which is elmple in form, and inconsistent with
the purposes of our system of registry. .
.â¢The contention of the trustees that,
though the trust to convey be void, it may
be held good as a "power in trust to con
vey"-.is declared- by the' Supreme Court
to be untenable. -The* decision states that,
though- the New York statutes provide
for a power of: trust to convey, yet the
code of this "State makes no such provi
sion. Decisions are then quoted, from tho
American. and English laws on this sub
ject as. to the "effect 'of such a contention
being held' valid in the Fair case. Contin
uing,, the decision says: â¢
It may . be remarked, ? generally, that while
a man's' power to say to whom his land shall
go when he dies is a proper and. valuable
property right, still there Is' no rule of law or
public policy which: calls upon a court, to be
diligent to discover . some way to make good
a man's Â¦ forbidden,- scheme ' to . determine who
shall have his property fifty . years after his
death.,- - ' Â¦ ' . .

guage. The decision on this point says:
Of course, the precise,*' technical -word "de
vise" Is not necessaryâ any other word or lan
guage, expressive of the same action or design
would be sufficientâ but in this will there is
no such language. There is no language what
ever upon the subject other than the direction
to transfer and convey; and to eliminate these
words would be to leave the estate, after the
death of all the decedent's, children, Â¦ entirely
undisposed of. â¢ .
Concerning the point raised by the. trus
tees that the intention of the testator
must prevail the decision says that the
rule cannot be applied in the Fair case
for the reason that the rule always in
cludes the proposition that the intention
must be found in the will itself.- '
' The Justices declare that where the tes
tator has clearly, expressed one intention
the court cannot impute to him 'another;
that the intention which clearly appears
must be lawful, and that the court can, in
no Instance, make for the testator a new
will. Continuing the decision says: â¢
Now jn'the case- at bar', It" is perfectly clear,
beyond even a reasonable Â¦. doubt, that the. tes-.
tutor . did not intend to devise estates in re-"
mainder to persons of the ' named classes, but
intended to devise' the whole fee to his trus
tees upon- trusts- to convey, after the expiration
of a probably very long period of tifne. to those
persons, so that VÂ»e latter would receive new
estates created .by the conveyances. There is
no room here for any construction based upon
an apparent cr presumed unskillfulness, ig
norance or negligence of the testator: the will
Is in apt legal phraseology; and his intentions
are clearly and accurately expressed. -

1 he restaurant. proprietors met a short
distance away and decided that - they
would not stand for the increase in wages
demanded. Delegates . Sanders . and Mac
kenzie espoused' the cause of the waiters
and waitresses. As. the matter stands at
present, there" will be another walkout
this morning, -when the night and day
watches change. - Who is to supply the
needed Â¦ help is now the question that the
restaurant-keepers will have to settle.
Chief of Police Sullivan and Captain
Wittman attended the meeting of the res
taurant-keepers and' promised ample po
lice protection. Hungry men and women
are assured of a. -breakfast at least, but
the noonday lunch, will probably have to
be taken at other than the usual places.
Both sides seem determined to carry out
the different policies, outlined.
The restaurant-keepers have established,
headquarters, at 127 Mason street, and
everybody who comes along with ability
to carry a pile of plate? on one arm is as
sured of an engagement. The cooks are
not. "out," but may sympathize with their
fellow workmen and join in.
It is said that those who had espoused
the cause of the waiters will feel the iron
hand* of the boycott. in a business way.
Those who are engaged in supplying food
and other things have been aligned in the
cause of the restaurant-keepers.
Shortly after midnight waiters walked
out of the various restaurants along Mar
ket street, crowds gathering to see the
excitement. Police officers, detailed to
clear the streets, gave the late diner-out
a chance to go -hungry, or take the last
car ' home.
The waitresses met. at 102 O'Farrell
street, sang songs and resolved that .it
was better not to work than to work for
less : than the schedule oÂ£ ' wages hereto
fore adopted. â¢
The waiters' strike is on. It commenced
at midnight. Two .meetings were held
last night. One was that of the women
who handle the plates; the other of the
restaurant-keepers. As neither side could
agree upon terms, a walkout was ordered.
