Ing Mr. Phelan was waiting for me at thÂ»

G. Tobin and Mr. Fay. We sat there until 3
o'clock, .the Mayor wondering and Inquiring
what trade could be brought about that would
allow him decently - to withdraw his veto on
Monday afternoon. His liberality went bo far
as to propose to me to engage myself, as an
individual, not to sell the . control of the San
ITrancisco Jockey Club for five years, and If
I would agree to keep Tanforan closed during
that time, then he would withdraw his veto.
I declined' this bargain, but realizing that all
the Mayor wanted was some ktnd of an ex
cuse "to his Board of Supervisors. I stated that
I would agree, for five. years, not to run at
Tanforan more than thlrty-stx days In tach

AFTER five weeks of strategic war
fare the two big jockey clubs of
California have ended their differ
ences and the greatest racetrack
war that the Pacific Coast has
ever known has come to a sudden, sur
prising and startling finish. No compro
mise, no temporizing measure, marked
the conclusion of this sensational war.
The decisive -battle .results In the ex
termination of one of the belligerents. By
the terms \ of peace the San Francisco
Jockey. Club delivers its racetrack prop
erties at-Ingleside and at Tanforan into
.the'ihandsjof.the California Jockey Club,
joi ! whl^h' JThomas^ H.j Williams,' Jr. is, the
ipresident^..; : ... Â¦
,_? Great ? financial- deals have.' been con
"sunimated in ;thls State,, but rarely, -. If
ever before, -has such a business arrange
ment, been made, under similar clrcurh
:stances. From. ; 11 o'clock Sunday even-
Ing until 5'o'clock Monday morning Prince
Ponlatowskf, president of the San Fran
cisco Jockey Club, turned night Into day
: ad he sat and talked . and talked with
\ Mayor, Phelan, Supervisor Joseph S.
Tobln and Secretary., Fay over the race
track situation, tho' Mayor's veto.' and
remedial : measures. . No satisfaction could
be obtained from "the ' Mayor, and the
quasi-social but earnest business party
; broke up. Then Prince Poniatowski joined
Thomas H. "Williams Jr., and In a tete-a
tete plans were perfected that rang down
; the curtain on the San Francisco Jockey
Club and made .the California Jockey
Club the premier and star racing pro
moter in the . West.
Mr. Williams had. an offer to make the
Prince for his Ingleslde and Tanforan
properties. It was none other than the
$600,000 original consideration for these
tracks, which the California Jockey Club
was willing to pay some weeks ago, when
hostilities were .declared. In the early
hours of the morning these two men
fought out the financial battle. "When the
day broke an Â«Breement / was reached. In
gleslde "and Tanforan practically passed
to the California Jockey. Club. The con
sideration was iGCO.OOO. But there Is a con
ditionâthat tho San Francisco Jockey
Club shall have uncompetltlve racing at
Tanforan for thirty days from the ' time
of signing. So there will be no more rac
ing at the Emeryville track for a month.
After, that a limited period of racing will
be on the cards, and then cessation until
next winter.
Now that harmony has been restored
arid the racing game is in the control of
one organization one of the principal par
ties concerned declares publicly what
were the transactions In which the Mayor
of San Francisco was involved In regard
to the Inglesldo reopening measure. The
following statement of Prince Poniatow
ski Is a short story In itself, telling its
own well-rounded tale. The Prince spares
neither venom nor sarcasm in his speech.'
Here is his statement:
To the members of the San Francisco Jockey
Clubâ Gentlemen: I feel ; It my duty to brine
to your knowledge without delay â¢> transac
tion to which I have considered It expedient
to become a. party/without having given suf
ficient time to consult as many members of
this club as I would have liked to.
' Without reviewing the history of this asso
ciation. It Is : essential that. In a few lines.
I outline to you the exact â¢", condition with
which I waÂ» confronted on Friday last.
' The Ean Francisco Jockey Club, formed In
September last, \ after ' having obtained full
control 'of the V Ingleside and - Tanf oran race
tracks, saw its membership. In the course of
t tares â¢ months*. ; reach 177. all leading men of
this city. Joined tonether with the sole idea
of bringing harmony and stability between the
racing factions ' in the" vicinity of San Fran
cisco. The attempt to accomplish this 'result,
rowever.dld not meet with favor. -and I need
r Dt i recall .."- the ' many circumstance* which
brought about the present crisis." . .)
' A sens* of Justice . and ; also ,the universal
conviction' that : the i people ; at : the head of our
association were ( actuated \ by earnest , and lib
eral 5 motives : caused , help and \ sympathy to ; be
received , from all . sides ; i the Board ; of ; Super-,
visors,, which had -closed . inKleslde,
toi: reopen'- it. - and Â¦'. during; the - deliberations." 1
which lasted several weeks, the Mayor himself
took a "most decided attitude In favor, of our
efforts. - '

WHAT THE PRINCE THINKS OF HIS HONOR, THE MAYOR.
"The poor little fellow was a pitiful sight at this stage, complaining of the, difficulties of the
case, which he admitted to be the worst he had ever had to contend with. I thought for a while that
in his distress he would find diffident co,urage to adopt my suggestion of Â¦ seventy-two days' limita
tion on racing between San Mateo and San Francisco counties. At 2 a. m. } however, I had to leave
him in a comatose condition, unable to say yes or no, and half an hour later I had threshed out with
Mr. Williams, representing the California Jockey Clubj an agreement putting a stop to the present
race war, the continuance of which was distasteful to the public and harmful to racing itself. This
agreement gives to these gentlemen the opportunity, within thirty days,' of bringing about a combi
nation by zvhich a corporation would control the three racetracks around this city. It is to be hoped
that if Mr: Williams succeeds in his attempt the magnitude of the corporation he. will have to form
will bring together gentlemen having sufficiently at heart the interests ofxtJie town to keep racing
around SanJFrancisco within a reasonable limitation of time. However j: it will be. in their hands to
run it every day and every night, and Sundays, if they choose to do so,- and I doubt if any of these
gentlemen will, sacrifice six hours of sleep to listen to such talks as : I had to stand . from the head
executive of this city. I yet feel ashamed of the tone I gradually had to assume in my last talk with
the Mayor, although he took it very meekly, as if his inner conscience coincided with the frankness
of my statements. During those- two midnight sessions he did not appear to grasp for an instant
the essence of the questions involved, which at the present time I am satisfied he docs not yet under
stand. Every one of .my suggestions was weighed by him at the present discount value of their fu
ture political advantage to himself. As to the justice of the case, the moral side of it or the substan
tial interest of the city, these zverc sidelights once or twice alluded to." â Excerpt from a state

GREAT BKITADT AND RUSSIA.
Relations Between Them May Be
Strained to Breaking Point. -
LONDON. 1 March 19.â The officials of the
British ' Foreign , Office have not yet re
ceived official confirmation of Russia's al
leged backdown \n regard * to Manchuria,
Turkestan. and Mongolia, and Inquiries on
the subject ara now being made at St.
Petersburg and Peking. The British.For
eign Office is not relaxing Its efforts to
secure a more satisfactory statement of
the Intentions of Russia, but the officials
deprecate the British press agitation on
the subject. On , all sides it is v offlcially
and otherwise said that Great Britain has
not the slightest' contemplation of resort-
Ing to. hostilities against Russia whatever
may be the outcome of the present nego
tiations.
Not Ready to Fight Russia.
â¢While hostilities are out of the question,
however. It Is not unlikely that diplomatic
relations between Great Britain and Rus
sia will become strained almost to the
breaking point. Possibly] British warships
may be dispatched to bring pressure to
bear upon Russia, but war will not result
unless some fracas quite unauthorized by
London j and ' St- jj Petersburg occurs be
tween the opposing' forces at Tientsin.
This assertion; is based upon extensive
Inquiries made In London. A prominent
British official, often the. mouthpiece of
the Government, whose position makes it
undesirable that ' he" should be named in
this connection, said this evening:
"It is useless for. our newspapers to use
provocative language.' They forget ' that
we -have a great j army in South Africa
and that we have no other, army, or the
makings of one, elsewhere. Â¦ It is'impossi
ble to go to "war with Russia."
A ' semi-official - statement -was Issued
this evening s the" effect that the . much
talked of assurances of the Russian For
eign Minister. Count von Lamsdorff, to Sir
Charles Stewart Scott, British Embassa
dor at St. Petersburg, were made Febru

Russo-Chinese agreement concluded ;. at

Hundred Thousand Dollars. .
SEYMOUR. Ind., March 13 âThe entire
village of Memphis, a place of BOO resi
dents, and located thirty-five miles soush
of here, was destroyed by lire to-day,
nnd many of tho people are without shel
ter or food. - The property loss is over
$100,000. The fire started from a spark
from . Haus* stave factory, and In less
than an hour the entire town was in
flames. Many cattle and several horses
wero burned. Seventy-five dwellings
were burned, and only ten are left stand
ing. Several hundred persons are shel
tered to-night in farmhouses and barns,
but scores were compelled to remain up
all night for lack of shelter. Women
and children suffered, and few secured"
anything to eat. It is not probable that
the place will be rebuilt, since most of the
people wero laborers, carried no insur
ance-on their dwellings and are unable
to rebuild.

storage plant of the Anheuser-Busch
Brewing Company, the repair shop of the
American Car and Foundry Company, to
gether; with a number of boxcars:, the
factory, of Stule & Co.. pickle manufactur
ers; flve rooming-houses and a number of
email sheds. The total damage is 1100.000,
the greater part of which Is covered/ by
Insurance. Two men. employes of the
American Car and Foundry Company,
were Injured, - but not seriously. The
burned district embraced two square
blocks, bounded by Zepp, Utah, First and
Kosclusko streets.
The fire broke out at 12:25 o'clock In ont
of the Anheuser-Busch Icehouses, all of
which are connected. A spark from a
passing s witch engine ; is credited with
having Ignited straw in the loft. While
the fire was In progress a stiff southeast
wind blew across tho river, from the Illi
nois side, fanning thÂ«s flames and making
the work of the firemen exceedingly diffi
cult Piles of, lumber adjacent to the
storage-house quickly , ignited, causing a
neat. which was intense.
For miles the rlvrr levee is fronted with
lumber yards, factories and warehouses,
while on the railroad tracks, with their
numerous switches, were scores of box
cars, many of them loaded with lumber
and other material which would. makÂ»
rich food for the flames. The high wind
lifted burning embers and carried them
for blocks to the northwest, terrorizing;
residents. Several times the department i
was compelled- to divide its force in an
swer to reports of fires elsewhere. No
buildings in the immediate path of the
names suffered damage, however, al
though cautious residents and business
men as far away a<j six blocks from the
ecene removed goods and furnishings
from dwellings and stores in a fear that
the fire would develop Into a widespread
conflagration.
Following Js a Ii3t of the losses: An
heuser-Busch â¢ ice storage plant, $37,000;
American Car and Foundry Company's
car sheds, $10,000; fifty old boxcars belong
ing to the Anheuser-BuSjh and William

$15,000.

SACRAMENTO, March 18.â A grave

for that reason the measure has under

with reference to Sacramento County,
which comes under the designation of a
county of the fifth class, as" weir as with
reference tor many other countles,"*~{he
measure ' directly \ conflicts with , a ", provi-
Bion of the constitution, since It proposes
to increase the salaries of county officers
during their term of . office. The : section
of the constitution to which reference is
made, No. - 11, | is as follows :
The compensation' of any. county," city, town'
or municipal officer shall not be Increased after

Notwithstanding this plain - Injunction,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, March 18.-One of the
most peculiar cases of bunko .ever knovn
in this vicinity { occurred here last week
and is now the cause of much amusement
to those not taken In and of chagrin to
the unfortunates who were the losens.
â¢ A man giving his name as Adolph Hot
ter arrived in Monterev last week and
took rooms at the Everett House. He an â¢
nounced that he came here from Milwau
kee to look over the ground and find a
suitable location for a chicken ranch,
which, he said, was to be run.- by elec
tricity and was to cost $15,000. After driv
ing about.the' country in every direction
he finally settled upon Carmel City, near
Point Lobos and about seven miles from
Monterey, as a goodvlocation and imme
diately set at work making the necessary
preliminary preparations. He negotiated
,for about ten acres of land at Carrrel
fClty. ordered $2000 worth of lumber. $o00
â¢worth of hardware, presenting a draft for
$4000, which wa3 perfectly, regular in ap
pearance." This draft was at once sent
on for collection to the tiank at Milwau
kee on which it was drawn. "
Before word came Dack from Milwaukee
Hotter "jumped" his board bill at the
Everett House on Saturday morning and
was arrested just as he was about to
board the train for San Francisco. Ho
was taken before Judge Lambert' of this
city and in default of tbO ball was locked
up.
Hotter's whole story during the process
of his negotiations was so j plausibio
that nobody suspected for a moment he
-was not the capitalist he pretended to be.
He said he had made $40,000 in Milwaukee
in raising chickens in electrical Incubators,
but that he was obliged to give up his
plant there because nis health would not
stand the rigorous winters. He described
the plant he intended establishing here
and said that there was a splendid open
ing for this particular enterprise, in this
section of Monterev County. Â¦ A\ real es
tate boom In Carmel City was. Imminent as
a result of his protected
Property-owners there becanfe quite ex
cited and a rapid listing of 'property be
gan. Everybody talked of the "project,
and the novelty of it onlv added zest tÂ«i
the general Interest.
It now appears that Hotter is from
San Frandsoo and Is demented, his mania
being electrical chicken raising. It seema
he escaped from the espionage which his
family keep upon his movements, and for
some time could not be lound. His brother
finally located him here and at once came
for him. Matters were adjusted witn
Judge Lambert and Hotter was taken
home by his brother. Â«.*.-.:
Seattle: Family's Alleged/ Discovery
in Metallurgy '-Will Be Put to a
Severe Test by Electric Company
SEATTLE, March 15.â If a discovery in
metallurgy made by a Seattle family Is
all that Is claimed for It a fortune of mil
lions Is In store for those who possess the
secret. . Mrs. > Carrie Reristrom and her
two sons, George A. Renstrom and R. 8.
Anderson, have, they claim, learned the
lost art of tempering copper to a fineness
and strenptti superior to the -best steel.
Mrs. Renstrom . asserts that she and her
two boys know the true process. , As proof
of her claim she had several. knives which
bear an edge fine and hard; enough -to cut
polished lron. : Applying their discovery
to practical uses, the Renstrom family
has made a trolley .wheel of solid .copper,
a thing: unheard of In electrical engineer-
Ing, and has offered it to the Seattle
Electric Company to be tested in' such
hard use where ordinary wheels of cop
per and bronze alloy .would wear In' a
month or nve weeks. .=
The process is a secret of the mother
and her two sons. They are haunted, by
the fear that while they are experiment
ing some prying: eye will discover, the
formula. -They will not even, say when
they made the discovery or where, it was
that after years of effort success crowned
their labors. Anderson, who is a son of
Mrs. Renstrom by a former marriage,
said to-day:- . '. ' â¢ â¢Â¦Â¦ Â¦"Â¦'Â¦ "
"Five years ago. while living. near Ar
lington, Qnohomtsh County, my mother
and myself began . experimenting . ; wlth
copper to discover some process by which
It could T be hardened â like â¢ steel. Taking
some pieces of. copper wire I : formed-- a^
knife, and then, making some researches,
adopted a formula for tempering. I failed,
naturally, and then began all over again.
My- mother undertook to solve the riddle
herself, and my half-brother, George Ren-'
strom, joined us. Together we worked for
days and week 1 ?. " *r.
"Not long, ago .George forged, a knife
and tempered It by our secret process. It
was as hard, as . the best grade of Im
ported steel and took an edge like a razor.
With the slightest touch it would cut a
piece of fine linen paper. Another piece
handled- In the same manner .was sharp
ened and with it. we could cut the face of
a polished 5 flatlron. We now have the
process perfected until we can temper

There were r.o grounds for any dispute
over the win of Horton In the closing
number. The little racehorse opened at
2, but so steady and stubborn was the
support afforded Sea Lion and Scotch
Plaid, each closing at 2, that 4\i and 5
could be had about -Horton around post
time. Domlnick, on Sea Lion, was away
in the lead, and whilo Caesar Young's
horse' appeared right up on edge, E.
Matthews, astride Horton, ran over him
the last eighth, winning easily by three
lengths. Just after the start Scotch Plaid
was cut off, running, unplaced.
. Hungarian and three others were
scratched from the first event, at five fur
longs, which sent Nullah to the post fa
vorite. The mare made all the running,
beating Homage and old I Don't Know
hands down.
Miss Rowena. the favorite, took the Fu
turity course sprint following after a long,
hard drive. The 107 pounds set very light
on the mare's back, enabling her to get
the decision by a head. Florista made a
favorable showing until the stretch turn
was reached, where he blew up.
Backed from 6 down to 7 to 2. Evea
G, a trim-looking daughter of Imp. Ju
venal, trained by Jimmy Coffey. left nine
behind her in the two-year-old scramble
at four furlongs. Fauntleroy sat in the
saddle. and. getting away well, won all
the way. Vasallo, the 11 to 5 favorite,
ridden by Mounce, was cut off right after
the start, but through clever handling
got up in time to finish third, behind
Barklylte.
George Miller's Merops came out a
strong choice over Hagerdon for the
fourth number, a seven-furlong jaunt,
and never bad a chance. The last-named
horse cut out all .the pace, reaching the
wire three lengths in front. Morelllto lin
ished In front of Young Morello and FUle
d'Or for the show.
There was some lively speculating over
the result of the mile selling affair. Rilly
Moore closing post favorite. While the
choice ran a vÂ£ry fair race he was easily
outfooted by Alturap. which scored clev
erly. The winner had his price cut from 6
to 3Â»>s to 1. Mont Kaele stumbled soon
after" the start, throwing Bassinger.

AT TANFORAN TRACK
THE wearers of the green had a
pay time at Tanforan yesterday.
In four of the six races the sham
rock color was under thÂ«Â» wlro
first. One Orangeman found his
way to the front and he felt out of place.
The day belonged to the favorites, only
a single overthrow "marring what was
otherwise" an unbroken , succession of
first choice winnings. The surprise was
Free Lance, who made Catastrophe feel
sad in the one rnll<? and a quarter race.
. Winnie O'Qonnor scored the first vic
tory. Mounted on Benson Caldwell. the
1 to 2 favorite, he waited until the turn
before his backers knew that they had a
chance. Then Birdie Stone, who was do
ing all the leading, and La Gorta fell back
while Caldwell and lllilouon and Princess
Tltanla, second choice, moved up. When
the seven and a half furlongs were fin
ished Caldwell had his teeth on the purse,
lllilouon getting the place and Princess
Tltanla the show. .
Rory Ough, with Burns up, broke the
Tanforan two-year-old record over three
furlongs. Instead of -.Sa^the mark will
now read :35Vi. Rory Ough was the fa
vcrite and led all the way. Henry, on
Ogle, coming in, for the place. There
wai a strong, play on Ogle, but the odds
did not materially change. San Lution
got the show at a big price.
Isaline, with Murphy up, won the eevon
furlong race after a clever ride by Mur
phy. Dr. Cave and Maggie Davis fig
ured in the llrst half of the race, but that
was all. Burns steered Redwald. into
port lor the place. "
The slow pace that was set In. the
fourth race, the mile and a quarter event
for four-year-olds and over, was respon
sible for a victory by Free Lance. 15 to 1.
Catastrophe was a 7 -to 10 favorite and
was thought to be the certainty of the
day. Turner, on the winner, took the
lead and was never headed-. "When It came
to the wind-up Free I^ance's sprinting
ability and his position near the rail kept
Catastrophe some distance from the first
money. The best O'Connor could do on
Ln. Borgia was third. s
Our Lizzie, the favorite, piloted Â¦ by
Henry, captured the fifth race from a
feld of seven. Doublet got away well at
the start and held the lead until, the rear
turn, when Our Lizzie worked her way
from fourth to 'first position.
Fhoenlssa and Bogus Bill, also in the
rear guard, began to pass the premature
filers. Burns got the place with Phoen
itsa and Slurphy came in for the show.
The fifth race was a three-cornered af
fair over the mile route between Formero,
See up; Andrisa, Daly on top, and Star
Chamber, with O'Connor * in the sa.ddle.
Andrisa got away at the rise of the bar
rier p.nd kept the lead until the turn, when
Star Chamber gathered up speed and
walked In. Formero trailed the full mile.

MUSIC LOVERS CROWD HOUSE.
Erilliant Representative Audienta
Welcomes Madams Sembrich.
IT was like the Grau days over again
at the Grand Opera-house last night,
- with the Sembrich Opera Company In
'.'The Barber of Seville" for pro
gramme. The house was Ideal from
the box office standpoint and immediately
sympathetic. r Audience and singers were
en! rapport from the first note to the t last
and the merry old opera was thus heard
under unusually happy conditions.'- .It
was indeed" an unwontedly enthusiastic
crowd, pleased with everything/from the
Sembrich warbllngs to the artless comedy
that' delighted its . ancestors' in: the long
ago. San Francisco has' evidently decided
to accept Mme. Sembrich and all that | is
hers, and the town gave her hands. and
heart last night in a fashion very foreign
.to the usual ; first-night audience of *. the
Athens of , the Pacific. And 'It is not so
wonderful after all. The star herself is
a fascinating personality, gloriously
voiced, and with a very sufficient dramatic
sense. Her support is much : above the
average setting of an operatic ,star and
her audience was very well educated In all
that a good little," audience should know
by Mr. Grau, some three or four months.
ago. Voila tout! ;?/
Sembrich Is delightful. That- she was
able to hold her own against the splendid
memories of Melba and the comparisons
instituted by the old-timers between her
and Patti denotes no mean triumph for
this latest of the great sopranos to come
among us. A rich, warm; full-bloode(j
voice she has; exquisitely sympathetic
and flexible and used- with the finest in
telligence. It has not the absolute purity
and pellucid quality of Melba's voice, but
its warmth, color and velvety richness
perhaps fully compensate. Her Roslna is
a charming conception, bli.the and coquet
tish, and she almost persuades to a belief
in the inherent vitality of the part.. In
the famous "singing lesson" the spontane
ous applause of the "evening reached its
height. Â». As an encore the singer gave the
"Sonnambula" rondo,, then an altogether
charming . rendering of "The Maiden's
"Wish" of Ghopln. The latter sons was
given * in Polish, and- Mme. Sembrich
played .her own accompaniment in de
lightfully artistic fashion. This naturally
drew- another encore, to Â¦which she re
sponded witlV a little German lied of Rles.
The Figaro' of the evening,. Signor Ben
saude, was adequate, but not astonishing,
neitherÂ«extraordlnary from the vocal nor
dramatic standpoint. His voice. is pleas
ing in quality and rather light. Signor
de Lara, who did the Alma viva, has a
very pleasing light tenor voice, sweet in
tomvbut not alwayd true to pitch. Signor
Rossi was an excellent Bartolo, droll and
fatuously self-satisfied aa the Gil Bias
figure of the guardian is meant to be and
vocally satisfactory. The basso, Signor
Dado; who. in- spite of. his. name is very
much more than a wallllower, has an ad
mirable voice, big, round and impressive,
and he was fully alive to all the comedy
possibilities of his part.
The chorus, of which of course only the
male contingent was represented last
evening, has a satisfying volume of voice,
but was not always rhythmically "there."
Tho orchestra was cleverly handled by
Signor Bevlgnani. but was a little too
loud In places, more especially in the
strings, ffo-morrow evening "LfÂ» Trav
iata" will' be given, with Mme. Sembrich
as Violetta.

have arranged to obtain records or a copy of
iecordÂ» of an Institution In the State of Illinois
concerning; a period of your lite which. If
placed before the public, will prove vÂ«ry hu
miliating, to you and place you before the pub
lic of Saa Francisco and Alan.eda In your true
UÂ«ht.
If you wish to meet me to-day at 1-30 p. m.
In the narrow-gauge ferry building:, a few min
utes' quiet talk will explain the matter to you
much better than writing'. If you do not meet
me as suggested, matters must take their
course and no atone will be left unturned to
lay your history before the public in Its trua
llffht. F. C. JACKSON.
If you should be oat. call me up by telephone
Main 263 as soon as you return.
After his arrest yesterday Jackson ad
mitted the authorship of the above let
ter, but declared ho had no intention of
trying to extort money from Currier. He
said while he knew nothing. of his own
knowledge concerning Currier's previous
history, which he proposed In his letter
to disclose, he had been informed by
other ' persons that the designer at one
time had bad the misfortune to be con
fined in an Eastern sanitarium, and it waa
this humiliating fact that he proposed to
make public unless Currier desisted In hi*
visits to see his own children, a privilege
he had enloyed since 1S96 until assaulted
by Jackson and prevented by force from
calling at their home.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's So
noma arrived from Sydney, N. S. \Y\, via
Auckland, Paso Pago and Honolulu, yes
terday, making the run from the latter
port in five days 11 hours 22 minutes.
Chief Engineer A. D. Little and First As
sistant S. H. Church are very proud of
their vessel, as she holds the record be
tween here and Sydney. She beat the Un
ion Steamship Company's crack flier Ma
raroa from Auckland to Sydney, at the
tame time establishing a new record for
tlie run.
When the Sonoma reached Auckland, X.
7... she found the Mararoa waiting for
her. She had been delayed twenty-four
hours ani during the wait picked coal was
put aboard and five extra firemen en
gagred. The Mararoa was just off the dry
t'ock. while the Sonoma was on Hunters
Point before leaving- Sail Francisco. At
midnight on February 12 the Mararoa got
away and 5 a. m. on the 13th the So
noma followed her. At 7 a. m. on the 16th
the Mararoa. passed in through Sydney
heads and at S:4i a. m. tne Sonoma fol
lowed her again, thus winning the race
by 3 hours 15 minutes. In order to do it
the Sonoma had to do better than seven
teen and a half knots an hour during- the
entire distance, her best run being: 435
knots in twenty-four hours. The crew of
the Sonoma say that more than $50,000
changed hands on the rate and there is
rot a man aboard who did not win a bet.
Purser G. A. Hodpson, who knew better
than anybody aboard just what the Ma
raroa could do, won a dczen hats by va
rious bets.
The Sonoma brought up 144 cabin pas
eens-ers and Â£? second cabin passengers,
besides O la the steeraee. Those who
came up in the first and second cables

THE sailing of transports and ar
rival of mail steamers made the
front lively yesterday. Cavalry
men and infantry hobnobbed on
the transport wharf, while women
in large numbers were down to bid the
soldiers a 'ast farewell.
The transport Meade was the first to
leave the wharf. She had aboard the
headquarters and two sc.uadrons of the
Fifth and two troops of the Fifteenth
Cavalry. She anchored in the stream
about 1 p. m. It was an hour later be
fore the Pennsylvania got away. The lat
ter transport, has on. board seven com
panies cf the Tenth Infantry and one
stowaway.
The list of those who went away on the
Meade Is as follows:
Brigadier General W. Ludlow. Brigadier
General James F. Wade, six officers and
1S9 men cf the Fifteenth Cavalry, seven
teen cScers and 713 men of the Fifth Cav
alry, twenty-eight recruits, one man of
the Twenty-first Infantry, who missed the
Indiana; five non-commissioned officers,
fifteen female civilians, three male civil
ians and nine children. The women ore
nearly all wives of officers who are going
to Manila to Join their husbands.
The Indiana took away ten officers and
Â£63 men of the Tenth Infantry, two acting
assistant surgeons, seven female civilians,
five male civilians, three children and two
stowaways. Of the female civilians, three
are the wives of officers now in the Philip
pines, three are soldiers' wives and one is
an army nurse. The three soldiers' wives
are all Cuban women and were married
to their husbands in Havana. One of the
trio is Mrs. Dusenbery-Hayes, the woman
whose bugler husband stowed her away
on tbe Indiana. When the circumstances
of her case were laid before General Shat
ter he issued a permit for all the Cuban
women to take passage on the Pennsyl
vania. The latter is a faster boat than
the Indiana and the chances are that Mrs.
Hayes will meet her husband in Hono
lulu.
After an examination by the authorities
the three boys found on the transports
were allowed to ci to Manila with the
troops, as three of the officers claimed
them as servants. Oscar Osdumas came
from Cuba with the Tenth Infantry. He
is 10 years of age and said to be well con
nected in Havana. lie was taken ashore,
much to the di^pust of Captain Purcell of
Companv I. Frank Torres and Joseph
Palmer came from Porto Rico with the
Filth Cavalry. Each lad is about 14 years
old, and when two officers claimed them
as servants thev were allowed to go
aboard the Mcade again with their bag
gage. m

Hope for the South. Portland.
It now begins to look as if the South
Portland would at last be raised and put
into commission again. Sunday night
enough water -was pumped out to bring
her almost on an even keel. It was then
fouid that the pumps were not low
enough to draw oft the water, so they had
to be taken down and the suction pipe
lowered. Should the steamer sink agam
while this Is being- done she will make a
new bed for herself and the work of raid
ing again will be easy. By noon to-day
Captain Whitelaw expects to have her
dear of -water and she will then go to the
iron -works for an overhauling.

the rate dropped to 50 per cent, only, to
again creep up to 60 per cent as the days
Â¦went by. Now another change has coma

The McLaurin incident is almost equally. significant

As soon as the facts were made known steps were
at once taken to put an end to the system. Judge
Benet of Anderson County, to whomthe Grand Jury
made its report, has proven to be the right man in
the right place. It was'in fact to his instructions that
the first investigation was due. He had heard of tha
wrong and instructed the Grand Jury to inquire into
it. The jury appears to have undertaken the work
with zeal and courage. We are told that at every step

richest, most influential and most powerful planters
declared they could not carry on their plantations
except under that system of- controlling labor. 'In
the face of such opposition, however, the jury wen*
on with its work, finding ample support from Â¦ the
Judge; and it now seems probable that not only will
the system be broken up, but that some at least of
the men who were guilty of the worst outrages com
mitted under it will be brought to punishment. â¢
The negro contract incident is one of more than
passing importance. The facts brought to light by
the investigations of the Grand Jury showed that m
certain counties of the State a practice had grown up of
getting ignorant negroes to sign contracts which gave
them in virtual bondage to their employer. The holder
of such a contract claimed under its terms the right
to sell the negro's labor to any other man who choss
to buy it. It has been the custom of the Justices of
the Peace to uphold the contracts, and negroes who
undertook to escape from the slavery to which they
were bound were at once remanded to the control of
the contract holder and he inflicted upon the negro
such punishment as he chose..
RECENT events in South Carolina are in the
nature of a dawning light that gives promise of
the speedy beginning of a better day in that
long benighted State. In the first place the disclosure
of the fact that negroes have been held in virtual slav
ery under a system of contracts has led to the prompt
breaking up of the system; and in the second place
the action of the State Legislature in refusing to cen
sure Senator McLaurin for voting with the Re-publi
cans on many party measures jn the Senate reveals
a weakening of the Bourbon forces among the people,
and shows that they are acquiring something of liber
ality in politics.
LIGHT IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
. Her statehood makes Utah at; present supreme in
the making and enforcing of statutes intended to
shield this. odium of the Mormon church.. That
church is rapidly colonizing Idaho and Wyoming, and
holds the balance of power in Arizona. It will soon
control the group of inter-mountain States, and they
will be theocracies, in their government, for the
church is paternal and controls the people in their
politics as well as in their materialities^ It will be well
if Congress act quickly in placing polygamy beside
its twin relic,' slavery, by a constitutional amendment.
The action of .the Legislature and the Supreme
Court decision will be a surprise:to the\wholc coun
try. It was supposed that polygamy was weakening
in its hold upon the people and was a fast fading insti
tution. But these revelations prove that it has a
stubborn hold and that its temporary suppression by
the Tucker-Edmunds law has only sexyed to increase
its strength.
This is rather turbid language,' employed in order
to omit use of the saored word polygamy, or plural
marriage. Its meaning, however, is plain. A Mormon.
can have his first or lawful wife in one county and a
dozen others in a^ioz-n different counties, and under
this decision can escape punishment, since his lawful
marriage, "an act or condition lawful in itself," can
be violated only in the county where the lawful wife
lives. This decision does not follow the statute of
adultery in the other States, nor does it follow inter
state law. In actions for 'divorce under .that statute
the act or acts of adultery may be proven anywhere in
the State or in other States. Were it not so the mar
riage contract would be without binding validity and
would furnish no protection to those who are party to
it. It will be noticed that the Utah: Supreme Court
goes clear beyond the verdict in the court below and
quashes the information.
The court says briefly: "The mere existence in
some other county than the place of trial of acts or
conditions of defendant lawful in and of themselves
but .necessary to be alleged and proven in order to
establish the crime as charged, does not involve the
power of this. statute so as to permit the trial of the
defendant in such other county."
IN the lower courts of Utah a Mormon was found
guilty of polygamy. His firstâ or lawfulâ wife lived
in Salt Lake County, the plural wife lived in Utah
County. He was indicted, and his relations with the
surplus wife were in cvidence'anxl the jury found him
guilty, the locus of the crime being in .the county
where the polygamous wife lived.
â¢The Supreme Court of Utah ha3 reversed the de
cision, set aside the verdict and quashed the informa-

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
It will be seen by the statements of the Senator that
California has many interests at the national capital
Â¦which will have to be looked after at the next session
of Congress with great care. The House is evidently
the danger point, and increased efforts will have to be
nade to render that branch of the Government as*
favorable to us at least as the Senate. The situation
should be thoroughly studied, the causes which led to
the failure cf California bills in the House should be
determined, and then some means devised for over
coming them.
That is certainly a striking list of measures to be
passed by one House but rejected by the other, and
it would be interesting to learn why the House is so
much Jess favorable to California interests than the
Senate. The subject is the more important because
neither branch of Congress has ever shown any
thing like an extravagant willingness to promote the
interests oi the Pacific Coast. At this very session, as
Senator Perkins points out, several bills of great im
portance to California failed in both houses. Among
them he specifies a bill providing for the establishment
ci a quarantine for nursery stock, one authorizing the,
entry and patenting of lands containing petroleum and
chiefly valuable therefor, and the mineral land bill pro
viding for the segregation of mineral . lands from
agricultural lands.
â¢ The bill to secure title to the two groves of big trees
In Calaveras and Mariposa counties, for the purpose
cf preserving them from destruction, was Introduced
by me at the first session and was passed by the Sen
ate early in the second session, but, in spite of e\*ery
effort, it could not be brought up in the House for a
vote, owtag to the opposition of Speaker Henderson.
Another effort will, therefore, have to be made to pre
serve these trees for posterity.
I regret exceedingly the defeat of the bill providing
for a. postal cable to the Hawaiian Islands, as I deem It
not only a measure of great importance to the Govern
ment, but also to the commercial Interests of our
country, and especially to California.
The bill introduced by me, providing for the coinage
cf nickels at the United States Branch Mint in San
Francisco, was also passed by the Senate and was re
ported back to the Houes by the Committee on Ways
and Means, but was never brought before the House
for a vote.
Another bill of great importance to commerce on the
Pacific Coast was introduced by me and was passed by
the Senate. It was that prohibiting the towing of logs
In rafts along the coast. The danger to navigation
from these loes, when the rafts break up, as they
usually <3o when rcugh weather is encountered, is great.
The bill was referred to the House Committee on Inter
state Commerce, which committee failed to report it
back. I offered an amendment to the sundry civil bill,
appropriating 5500,000 for making and laying a cable
from San Francisco to Honolulu, but the House of Rep
resentatives having declined to pass the bill that the
Senate adopted one year ego, this amendment was not
a creed to.
Several important bills were passed by the Senate,
but failed in the House. One of very great importance
was that providing for the erection cf a new custom
house In San Francisco, on the site of the present
structure. The bill introduced by me was passed by
the Senate, appropriating $1,500,000 for construction. The
l>ill was referred to the House Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, but was never reported by that
body.
The same fate befell the bill introduced by me pro
viding for the relinquishment by the United States of
all title to the old Marine Hospital and grounds for the
purpose of establishing a Bailors' home under local
supervision and It was passed by the Senate,
but was not reported from the House committee.

The result of this experiment the lint
of its kind by Japan. , will bo watched
with interest- The theory of it has been
learned by study of Occidental methods
but the practical application Is Japanese.'
It should always be borne in mind that
It is the expressed determination of thÂ«
Japanese that Formosa - must be midÂ«

empire. Whatever mlstakes^they ha V Â«
made, or may make, that is their ntâ¢

Just as : it has been in the territory *r

. When the Japanese first entered For
mosa the people as a whole manifested
considerable suspicion and antipathy due
to - misrepresentations by persons 'who
wished to profit by a continuance of the
old conditions. But when the people saw
that In spite of mistakes and corruption
the Japanese meant well, and that it waa
greatly to the advantage of Formosa to
be under such a stable and responsible
government as the Japanese would and
could give, feeling 1 of good will and con
fidence quickly followed. Now that they
can see plainly the material advantages
that are accruing to the Island they are
completely- reconciled. A missionary who
has lived twenty-five years in Formosa
gives bis testimony In behalf of the bene
fits obtained by getting rid -of Chinese
officialdom and the literary class, who are
"a narrow-minded and Impracticable body
of men." â¢
Drawing Colony and Empire Close.
"With reference to the rebels, Baron Ko
dama's policy Is to wage relentless war
on bandits, but when once they have sub
mitted he pursues a conciliatory pblicv
Count Kabayama's plan was similar!
"Subjugate It from onÂ© side by. force of
arms and then confer on the subjueatad
portion the benefits of civil government."
It has also been found advisable to adorn
the sliver yen as the basis of the cur
rency in Formosa, chiefly because of ltÂ«t
convenience in Internal business and the
external trade with the adjoining conti
nent of China. This course found Implovl
ment for the cne-yen coins, which after
the adoption of the gold standard by the
Japanese Government had been gradually
.withdrawn from circulation in the em
pire proper. Whether or not the use of
ther silver standard in Formosa and the
gold standard .n all other portions of the
empire will cause serious confusion re
mains to be seen.
Dealing- "With. Rebellious Natives.
It WSRTalso made a definite policy that
in many cases Formosa should be exempt
ed from the general laws and ordinances
of the empire and that special laws and
ordinances should be promulgated In con
sonance with old customs. This policy
was applied especially in connection with
the modern revised codes, from the ap
plication of which Chinese and aborigines
were exempted.
When Baron Kodama assumed the
Governor Generalship a more definite pol
icy and strict administration of affairs
began. Local self-administration waa en
couraged, particularly by the employment
of properly qualified natives in subordi
nate positions. For instance, as a very
striking example, ex-bandits who had
sworn allegiance were given mail con
tracts, which were thus carried out cheap
er than before, because when civilians
carried tho malls It- was necessary for
each to be accompanied by a soldier or
policeman for protection against bandits
It also proved feasible to use natives in
the militia, and even to appoint some of
the naturalized subjects to important
posts, as those of councilors, under the
prefectoral officer.
The report of the Bank of Formosa,
while it calls attention to the fluctuations
or silver as a disturbing feature also
gives great encouragement with reference
to the future of the- island.
According to Dr, Goto, chief of the civil ad
ministration of Formosa, the result of the last
three years' administrative efforts under the
present able Governor General. Baron Kodama,
has been successful beyond all reasonable ex
pectations. "When his Excellency first assumed
the control of affairs In the island colony in
1S9S it waa estimated by him that the revenue
which was at that time less than B.OOO.OOO yen
per annum, would be increased to about double
that sum by the year 1901-02. That estimate
was regarded in some quarters as too optimis
tic, but too optimistic it was not, it bt\ng esti
mated that In the coming fiscal year the reve
nue will amount to over 14.0CO.00O yen. The
Formosan authorities now confidently expect
that the ordinary Income of the island will
swell to 20.OCO.000 In the next three or four
years,- when the island will financially be en

The difference between revenue and ex
penditure Is made up by railway loans and
the subsidy of the general budget of the
empire. The revenue is rapidly Increas
ing and In a feyr years there will be no
need of subsidy. The natives also Wiu

regarding Formosa I am indebted to Mr.
Sakatani, the expert of the finance de

Earon/Kodama, Governor Gen
eral of Formosa.
It may seem strange that all this strife and jealousy
should exist over a struggle for sunshine when there
i.- so much sunshine in the world, but it is to be
borne in mind that when people once get greedy for
anything they can never get enough so long as any
body else has any at all. If the strugglers for sunshine
should get possession of the whole earth they would
not be satisfied, but would straightway reach out for
the sun.
Recent developments in the camps of the allies
go far to confirm the views of Richter. At thÂ»
present time_ there is "more likelihood of a violent
collision among the allied powers than of a harmo
nious settlement of their claims against China. The
troorjs of Great Britain and of Russia are glaring at one;
another across a railway siding at Tientsin, and then;
may be a clash at any moment. Furthermore the Japs
are reported to be eager to get at the Russians atvl
drive them out of Manchuria. Germany also, it seems,
is watching Russia with something of jealousy, and is
reported to have given notice to the Chinese. Gcfvern
ment not to make concessions to the Czar.
Sunshine of that, sort costs money. All the por
tents of the situation give warning that it will be
a long time before the Kaiser can enjoy sunshine in
China in an undisturbed peace, and already his ex
penditures have been large. Herr Richter, the Rad
ical leader in the Reichstag, stated in reply to Von
Bulow's speech that the Chinese troubles have cost
Germany up to this time 276,060,000 marks, or a sum
larger than the profits of Germany's trade with China
for the last twelve years. He closed by saying the
Kaiser might be earnestly looking for sunshine but
he had gone the wrong \vay about it and had .run
up a blind alley.
So it appears the struggle in China is a struggle
for sunshine. It is not a war for anything so bloody
as conquest nor for anything so sordid as trade.
Neither is it a fanatic attempt to interfere with Chinese
religion nor an educational movement to uplift the
Chinese masses.' It :s simply a desire for sunshine.
The invasion is, in fact, a .. sort of picnic excursion
in search of light and warmth, and such bloodshed
as occurs must be attributed solely to the rouglu
and toughs of other nations who try to crowd the
Kaiser into the shade.
COUNT VON BULOW, in defending the cours
pursued by the German Government in China,
denied that Germany is serving either British
oc Russian interests, and^insisted with much emphasis
that it is German interests alone the Kaiser and- his
troops are defending in the Orient. Wanning to" his
theme, he added: "That we must defend our interests
in. Eastern Asia is a fact that has become historic, i It
was in that sense I said three months ago that we
must have our place in the sunshine. I say to-day
we w.ll keep that place in 'the sunshine and not let
cun elves be pushed into the shadow."

-' The new organization of tho Formosa ad
ministration Is a very interesting: piece of leg
islation. - Its most noteworthy feature Is the
extensive power vested in the Governor Gen
eral. He is to control the military, naval and
civil", affairs of the" Island. In the former
sphere â namely, the military and naval â he Is
subject to the direction of the Ministers of War
and the Navy, as well as to that of the chief
of the central staff, the chief of the naval
board -of. command in, the empire and tha In
spector General ot the forces. But In the do
main of civil affairs he is virtually autocratic.
He may delegate civil functions to military
officers; he may suspend or rescind the orders
issued. by local governors or headmen: he may
appoint or dismiss officials of hannin rank; he
may Inflict disciplinary punishments and- he
may Issue : ordinances with final provisions r up
to a year's- imprisonment or a fine of 200 yen.
Virtually. ; the only restrictions Imposed on the
exercise of his civil authority are that he may
not appoint, dismiss or inflict disciplinary pun
ishments on officials of sonin rank and upward
without obtaining imperial sanction through
the Minister -President of State. He may em
ploy military 1 force for _the : maintenance '. of
public Deace" and good order, but in such an
event the Â¦ fact . must be reported without loss
of -' time â¢ to the : Minister President of State
and to the deDartments of the . army and the

ment has acted wisely, we think. !n this mat
ter. .'It will no longer be possible for the Gov

G reat Advance Made : by the Colony.
Of course, blunders were made at first
in tho administration of Fqrmosan af
fairs, and a great deal of Incapacity and
corruption manifested themselves in of
ficial circles. Through political Influence
Incapable and dishonest persona obtained
official positions. The scandals became so
well known and the corruption so promi
nent that -in 1897 a complete reorganiza
tion became necessary and was effected.
The following summary of the changes Is
from a reliable source: - '.-^<--.:r
Then followed for Beveral months a
spirited discussion in the press, and even
in the imperial IHet, on the question
whether the constitution extended over
Formosa, The debate was carried along
on exactly the same lines as the more re
cent discussion as to whether the United
States constitution extends over the Phil
ippines. In Japan It has been finally de
cided by public and legal opinion that
the crown, and not the constitution, is
paramount in Formosa; that the consti
tution is not, per se. In force, . buf must
be made specially applicable in Formosa,
One specially interesting question arose
In connection with the forced retirement
of the Chief Judge of the Formosa Court
without specific reasons. The Judge him
self refused to acknowledge the right of
the Governor General to retire him, and
fell back on the Japanese constitution,
chapter 5, article 58. second paragraph,
which reads as follows: -
* No Judge shall be deprived ot hla position
unless by way of criminal sentence or disci
plinary punishment
The first difficult question that arose
concerned the status of the Chinese resi
dents of Formosa. Article 5 of the Shi
monoseki treaty reads as follows:
"The inhabitants of the territories ceded
to Japan who wish to take up their resi
dence outside the ceded districts shall be
at liberty to sell their real property and
retire. For this purpose a period of two
years from the date of exchange of rati
fications of the present act shall be grant
ed. At the expiration of that period, those
of the Inhabitants wno shall not have left
such territories shall, at the option of Ja
pan, be deemed to be Japanese subjects."
The anxiety, however, which was felt
with reference to the working of these
stipulation's was entirely unfounded; for,
by the expiration of the time limit (May,
1897) only a few Chinese had sold out and
returned to the mainland, while most of
the others quietly and willingly put them
selves under Japanese Jurisdiction.
Another embarrassing matter was the
opium question. Inasmuch as the im
portation of opium into Japan is forbid
den, the onty apparently consistent
course would have Been to prohibit the
importation into Formosa. This was the
policy adopted by the Japanese Govern
ment; but at the same time it was recog
nized that It would be impossible to abol
ish opium smoking at once among the
thousands of Chinese there. Consequent
ly exception was made in the cases of ir
retrievable smokers, to whom special li
censes have been granted. It Is expect
ed, however, that the number of these li
censed smokers will gradually decrease
until ; the evil Is practically eradicated
from the "beautiful island.''
A similar policy was followed with
reference to foot binding, which is not
positively prohibited, but is discouraged
as much as possible. *
Bid Constitution Follow the Flag?
Early Difficulties in Formosa.
An attempt of the Chinese In Formosa
to establish a republic proved abortive,
so that by October, 1S95, the Japanese had
secured military occupation of the island,
although it was many months before that
occupancy became real. For several
years, indeed, regular or guerrilla war
fare was continued by Chinese bandits
and tho aborigines; and even now occa
sional outbreaks are experienced. The
military occupation of Formosa was ac
complished under the command of Count
Admiral Kabayama, tho hero of the Yalu
naval battle, and Prince Kltashirakawa,
who fell a' victim to disease in that Isl
and. Count Kabayama was the first Mili
tary Governor, and when military occupa
tion gave way to civil government he be
came the first Governor General of the
new territory.
When Count Kabayama retired from
that* position he was succeeded by Vis
count General Kutsura, who has recently
resigned the army portfolio. Next came
Baron General Nogi, and then Baron Gen
eral Kodama, who holds the position at
present, together with the army portfolio.
No civilian Is "eligible to the Governor
Generalship.
The questions that have presented them
selves to Japan in connection with colo
nial administration in Formosa have been
both general and special. For a very brief
period Formosan affairs were under a sep
arate department of state, with a minis
ter arid vice minister of colonization, as
well as subordinate officials. The two
chief positions were held by Viscount Ta
kashima and Mr. Kitagaki. Rut when ad
ministrative economy and reform were de
manded this department was abolished
and the Governor General, appointed by
the Emperor upon the recommendation of
the Cabinet, waa made responsible direct
ly to the Cabinet. This is the situation at
present: Matters pertaining to the army
in Formosa come under the army depart

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
The future peace and happiness of our own people
will be greatly promoted by reaching and settling
these issues as soon *s possible.
In that part of the problem the keen and practical
views of Mr. Ting are worth all the rhetoric in the
world. The practical question is; How much labor
is to be required to make the islands worth keeping,
and whence is it to come?
This is more than probably true. It is the next step
that must be considered. In the noise and confusion
of military operations and the impingement of the
Question upon politics these practical matters which
go to the value of the whole adventure have not been
thought of. Senators Beveridge and Carter, and
orhers have inflamed the American mind about the
vast riches of the archipelago. But they have not
qualified their jeweled prospectus by the 'reflection
that no matter how inexhaustible the wealth human
labor is required to transmute it for human use.
â¢Now the sooner this country gets face to face with
this situation the better. That Mr. Ting is right about
native labor and white labor there is no question, and
that he is right about what may be done there with
coolie labor may not be questioned. But, he says:
"You cannot bring labor from your own country to
the tropics, for your laborers cannot stand that cli
mate nor live as cheaply as is necessary there. If the
United States is to be a colonizing power it must
change its immigration laws as to the colonies, regard
less of what these laws may be in the home country."
Other thousands he would import at a cost of $10
per head, with as much more to buy rice until they got
started. He says he can take millions of coolies
there who have enough money to buy an acre or two
of land, finally to become employers of new importa
tions. It is his opinion that the islands will support
25,000,000 of Chinese, whose product will constitute
an enormous export of sugar, tobacco, rice and hemp.
Chung Yick Ting, a rich tin mine owner in the
Straits Settlements, says that he has already discussed
the development of the Philippines by coolie labor.
He says that the islands can be made the garden of
gardens, but not. by white labor, which cannot live
there. He advises that our Government confiscate all
property of insurgents who do not lay down their
arms by a given date and exile its owners to Guam,
creating there a penal colony, and then open the isl
ands to Chinese labor. He would build a railroad the
whole length of Luzon, following the Rio Grande de
Cagayan, with "branches, to be constructed by coolie
labor, and he declares such a road would pay from
the running of the first train. This construction
would employ thousands of coolies ahd would give
them some funds with which to permanently locate in
the country and perform its labor.
Mr. Blithecote, an . American gentleman, reports
that Chinese capitalists stand ready to introduce any
required number of coolies into the Philippines if
permitted by the United States. - 'V''
The Chinese merchants and capitalists, driven out
cf their own country by its conservatism, are the ex
ploiters of -neighboring countries in the Orient and
the exporters thereto of their coolie countrymen as
laborers.
In those tropical countries there are valuable re
sources, but labor is required for their development.
The natives will not work beyond self-support, and
Europeans and Ameiicans cannot work in that cli
mate The whole Malay Peninsula and the Straits
Settlements depend entirely on Chinese labor, and
greatly on Chinese commercial enterprise, for their de
velopment and profit. The iron and tin mines, the
gambier, pepper, sago, rice, tobacco, tea, coffee and
cocoa plantations are worked entirely by Chinese, and
would go back to nature and be disused in one season
without them. The tlamar, rattan and other substi
tutes for timber and the timber forests themselves arc
worked by Chinese.
IT is to be hoped that the necessity for military
operations, occupancy and government of the Phil
ippines may soon cease. Until they do this coun
try cannot reach a proper comprehension of the task
it has on hand in those islands. The crux of that sit
uation is its industrial rspect. Throughout thVMalay
Peninsula, the Straits Settlements and to an extent
in Burmah, the native labor is not productive of a
surplus.

Carolina is about to abandon the policies of Calhoun

Lees to Assist in BQtkin Trial.

active Interest In assisting the prosecu-;
tlon in the second trial; of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin for murder. He Is thoroughly, fa
miliar with all the facts in ; the case and
yesterday had a consultation with Dis
trict Attorney Byington and also with
Chief Sullivan. Judge Cook, when the
proper time arrives, will make an .order
on the State Treasurer; for the expenses
of bringing: the witnesses from" Delaware

Mr*. Fay J. Barnes appeared in Judge
Kerrigan's court yesterday morning, ac
companied by her counsel and witnesses,
to prosecute her suit to recover $10,000
damages for breach of promise from
Thomas J. Hemmenway of the Fireman's
Fund Insurance Company. After she had
presented her proofs, counsel represent
ing the defendant moved for a nonsuit
on the ground that at the time Hemmen
way asked her to become ~his bride sh;
had no legal or moral right to accept his
offer, for she was already married.
On behalf of Mrs. Barnes it was argue!
that as Hemmenway had advanced $20
toward the expenses of the suit through
which Mrs. Barnes obtained a divorce, in
order that she might bear the name of
Hemmenway, and that aa their engage
ment was announced subsequent to the
Bigning of the decree, Hemmenway could
not plead that the contract to become man
and wife was against public policy ami
void, even though Mrs. Barnes accepted
Hemmenway'8 proposal before freeing
herself from the claims of her former hus
band. Judge Kerrigan will pass on the
motion for a nonsuit this morning.
Mrs. Barnes, who is the daughter of
Dr. James Frost, testified that Hemmen
way first called at her home, 2304 Mission
street, in 1S92, and though she was ma:
rled he was persistent in his attention.
She said Hemmenway advanced $20 to
ward the expenses of her divorce suit, and
when she was free their engagement wae
announced. Subsequently, she continued,
they went to Capitola and registered as
man and wife.
On their return she prepared for her
marriage. She selected Mra. Belle Storm,
then Belle Copphe, for her bridesmaid,
and he announced that his brother would
act as his best man. She spent $100 for a
trousseau, consulted Father McGlnty
about her approaching marriage, but waj
informed that as ebe was a divorced wo
man it was necessary that 6he secure a
special dispensation before she couiil
> marry in tho church.
While theBÂ« preparations were rolng
merrily on Hemmenway, In July of 1837,
went to New York. On his return in No
vember of 1897 she called upon him at his
office and asked him what his sudden de
parture and silence during his absence
meant.
"He told mt that it was all off," con
cluded Mrs. Barnes, "and that I could not
blackmail him. Then I instructed my at
torneys to file suit." '
Dr. Frost, the plaintiff's father, was
next called to the stand. His testimony
was altogether prosaic. He had known of
Hemmenway's frequent calls at his
daughter's home, or at least had heard of
them. He had also heard of their engage
ment and was also the recipient of a let
ter from Hemmenway, in which the writer
stated that he had broken off his engage
ment with Mrs. Barnes, as he had come
to the conclusion that her temper waa
such as to make it impossible for them to
live happily together.
Willis E. Dean, a postofflce clerk; wa/Â»
the last witness called during the session
by plaintiff's counsel and he proved a sur
prise. Before he had proceeded far he an
nounced that Mrs. Barnes did not always
act ladylike, "because she appeared to like
liquor." â¢
The motion for a nonsuit was then ar
gued and submitted for decision.

Mrs. Ella F. Murray, daughter and sole
heir of the late Mrs. Almira S. Town
send, created a sensation in Judge
Troutt's court yesterday afternoon by
charging Public Administrator Boland
and his attorney, M. C. Hassett, with try
ing to "hold her up for $5000 under threat
that if she did not comply with their de
mand they would keep her mother's estate
in the courts for five years and more if
necessary." Mrs. Murray's charge was
dramatically and vehemently made and
under oath. She rose from the witness
stand, and, with flashing eyes, shook her
finger at Hassett, who waa seated at the
bar, and concluded her indictment with
the remark, quietly made, "Yes, and I of
fered them $2500 to drop their pursuit of
me, because I want my freedom; I want
my freedom." /
Sullivan Makes a Charge.
A preliminary remark made by Attorney
Matt Sullivan, of the firm of Sullivan &
Sullivan, somewhat prepared the court,
attorneys and spectators for the sensa
tion that was to come. A motion for the
distribution of" the late Mrs. Townsend s
$600,000 estate to her daughter, Mrs. Mur
ray, was being argued. During the hours
of the session Hassett had been protesting
against the proposed distribution on the
giound that it would defeat the rights of
the Public Administrator, who was pre
paring his appeal to the Supreme Court
from the order made by Judge Dunne
denying his petition for letters of admin
istration upon Mrs. Townsend's estate and
granting the same to Ella F. Murray.
Hassett quoted authorities and cited facts,
but just as persistently the opposing coun
sel wo.uld assail the legaUlabrlc he, was
building and from the intimations let fall
from time to time by the court, success
fully SO.
Finally, Matt Sullivan, worried at the
peristent resistance to his application for
distribution on behalf of Mrs. Murray,
rose from his chair and addressing the
court, said:
"If it please the court, the threat has
been made that if certain demands are not
complied with this case will be kept in the
courts for live years. We are not willing
to be stood up for money and we ask this
court to fully investigate the right of
those opposing this application to do so."
I Hassett made no reply, though it was
clear that his side of the case was being
I aimed at.
Mrs. Murray's Indictment.
Judge Troutt ordered that the argument
on the application for distribution proceed,
but Mr. Sullivan stated that he would
first call Mrs. Murray to the stand. Mrs.
Murray, without hesitation, mounted the
steps to the witness stand and waa sworn.
"Is it not a fact," -questioned Attorney
Sullivan, "that Mr. Hassett demanded, on
behalf of himself and the Public Adminis
trator, the sum of $500 under the threat
that if the same was not paid this estate
could be kept in court for five years?"
"Yes," answered Mrs. Murray, rising
frcm her chair. "They demanded $5000 of
me. tl offered them $2500 to quit their
pursuit of me, but they would not take It.
I did not feel that they were entitled to
any money; I knew they were not, but I
would pay them, to cease this litigation,
because 1 want my freedom; I want my
freedom."
"That is all," said Attorney Sullivan,
and Mrs. Murray started from the stand,
when she was halted by Hassett's words,
"Wait a moment, madam."
Hassett Takes the Witness.
Mrs. Murray returned to the. stand.
"Is It not a fact that you first called upon
me and offered to compromise with my
office and for that purpose said you were
willing to give $2500?" asked Haasett.
"Yea. I did call on you and you said
that you would see Mr. Boland and let me
know."
"Did I ever demand $5000 from you in re
turn for the promise to drop this litiga.
tion?" continued Hassett.
"You did not personally," answered
Mrs. Murray tartly, "but you did through
my agent, John T. Harmes. Mr. Harmes
came to me and said that you had seen
Mr. Boland and that you would not take
$2500, but told him that if I did not give
you J5000 you would keep me in the courts
for five years and more, if necessary. Mr.
Harmes told me this, but he came direct
ly from you."
"I am sorry- that Mr. Harmes' name
should have been drawn into this dis
pute," said Hassett, addressing the court,
"but it seema that in this case these dis
putes cannot be avoided. I will ask the
court to order all of this testimony and
the remarks of counsel bearing upon this
alleged 'hold-up' stricken from the
record."
Charges Are Stricken Out.
Judge Troutt granted the motion and as
the entire dispute was expunged from the
record the incident is closed. After the
granting of the motion to strike out,
counsel proceeded with the argu
ment of the petition . for distribution,
which, at the close of the sitting, was
submitted for decision.
Public Administrator Boland manifest
ed no astonishment when he heard of
Mrs. Murray's charge. He said:'
"I would not be surprised at any thing
that woman might do or say." He was
Indignant that any such accusation had
been made -against him and stated that
there had never been any . attempt to
make a compromise in the matter of the
Townsend estate on his part or on that
of his lawver.
"The only time anything was ever said
about settling the case out of court," said
Mr. Boland, "was one night recently,
when Mrs. Murray called at my house for
the purpose of making some kind of a
proposition. She was shown in and sat
down on the edge of a chair. She fidget
ed around for a. minute or two and then
asked me to close the door. I told, her
that there was no one in the house who
would publish anything she might have
to say. She began very softly and said
she wanted to effect a compromise. I
told her that I did not believe In com
promising cases and that I only wanted
my rights.
Mrs. Murray Becomes Excited.
Boland Deni?s Charges.
"Mrs. Murray became excited then and
said: 'I have plenty- of money and can
stick it out.' 'I told her that I was glad
of that and that while I didn't have any
too much myself I always liked to see
other people have plenty. She began to
make so much noise then that she was
disturbing the house, and I got up and
closed the door. She tried to argue the
case, with me, but I told her the courts
were the proper place for that. Then she
ran through all her family history, crying
and pleading with me. I did not want to
throw her out bodily, for she was In my
own house, but I couldn't persuade her to
stop her noise and go out peaceably. She
made all Â¦ sorts of appeals to me in an
attempt to induce me to give up my case.
"We never got far enough to mention
the question of dollars and cents, because
I refused to discuss the matter at all.
She made me promise not to tell that she
had been up there and I never mentioned
it to any one till I heard that- she was
spreading all sorts of stories about It, and
then I considered that I had no reason
to keep silent on the matter.
"So far as I know there never was any
discussion about a compromise '< between
the lawyers. The charge she made
against me Js untrue and utterly with
out foundation. I repudiate It entirely."
Boland stated that he thought he was
right in the case and would conscientious
ly, try to win it. The evidence adduced at
the trial was enough to show that Mrs.
Murray was not a resident of. the State,
he said, and showed nothing but her "in
tention" to become one. Hence, Mr. Bo
land concluded, he had a right to letters
in the estate of the late Almira S. Town
send and would continue to believe so
until the appellate court held otherwise..
BANNISTER LOSES
HIS GOLD WATCH
E. D. Bannister, mining promoter and
guest at the Occidental Hotel, is having a
nerve-racking time endeavoring to placate
his creditor, L. Slsenvine, distributer of
cigars at the Palace Hotel, who has a
claim of $500 against him. Sisenvine had
Bannister up before Judge Graham yes
terday on an order to show cause, and De
fore the proceedings were over the Sheriff
had an order to attach Bannister's gold
watch, a present made him twenty years
ago, and $100 in gold. , '
Abandoning the matter of a receiver for
a time, counsel questioned Bannister as
to his immediate resources. Bannister ad
mitted that he had a gold watch and
about 5100 in gold. Counsel Immediately
moved that the court mane an order di
recting him to strip himself of his gold
and jewelry. Bannister then said that he
did not have all of the money with him.
Judge Graham then made an order direct
ing him to forthwith get his gold and jew
elry together and turn the same over to
the Sheriff, to apply upon the Judgment.
Bannister said he would obey the court,
and was about to leave the room when he
was informed that he was to return on
the 25th lnst. to give counsel a further op
portunity to examine into the condition of
his exchequer.

On April 12 the parties above mentioned
will have to appear before the Circuit
Court Judge in Los Angeles to show cause
why the provisional order should not be
made Â¦ permanent. The disposition of the
valuable oil lands left by Cuoco will thus
be made by the Federal courts. It Is unÂ»
derstood that information is in the hands
of the attorneys for the absent heirs, that,
previous to the " sale of the oil lands by
Public Administrator Drinkhouse he in
spected the property and was accompanied
by Attorney Ruef.
The solicitors for the absent heirs are T
J. Lyons and General S. E. Â¦ Houghton.
When the mandate of the Circuit Court
was presented to Judge Troutt yesterday
the hearing of the litigation in the Cuoco
estate was not proceeded with. â¢ The or
der of the Circuit Court restrained Baci
galupi, Wagy, Canale and .Lamberson
from appearing in any of the proceedings
in the Superior Court and Judge Troutt
decided that it would be best to put the
entire matter over for a month. . :
A significant fact mentioned in the com
plaint is that oh January 26, the day after
Serra sold the property, Bacigalupi con
veyd a one-sixth interest in the land to D.
Canale; M. B. Wagy received a one- third
interest and Lamberson also received a
third.
Bacigalupi Divides Property.
The complaint allcpes that .Bacigalupi
and his attorney, Lamberson, induced
Italian Consul Serra to sell the interest
of the absent heirs to the estate for $800
by representing, by gross fraud and de
ceit, that the property was worth but very
little. The complaint avers that Serra
was told on January 25 by Bacigalupi and
Lamberson that the heirs would get noth
ing unless the property was sold on that
date and that Drinkhouse and Ruef would
so manage that the heirs would get noth
ing.-.
Bacigalupi and Lamberson are further
charged with having told Serra that a
suit had been brought against Drink
house by a person who laid claim to the
property and that Drinkhouse was In col
lusion and would not defend the suit. The
complaint alleges that the heirs subse
quently discovered that M. S. Wagy had
tiled such a suit and that Lamberson was
the attorney in the case.
By representations of fraud and deceit,
the complaint avers, Serra was In
duced to sell the Kern County land to
Bacigalupi and did so on account of the
representations of Lamberson.
Gross Fraud Is Charged.
On February 11, the date set for the
hearing of the return of sale by Drink
house to Bohls, the matter was not on
the calendar which is printed daily and
the complaint states that it was placed
on the same by verbal application.
The complaint alleges that the import
ant documents above mentioned were
from February 1 to February 11 kept from
the court records and were in the posses
sion of A. Ruef, attorney for Public Ad
ministrator Drinkhouse, and that from
February 1 to February 11 there was
nothing to indicate to interested parties
that important documents, signed by tho
Judge of the court, were in the possession
of Ruef. when they should have been on
record. ' â¢ Â¦
On February 11 Judge Troutt confirmed
the sale of the Kern County land made by
Administrator Drinkhouse to Bohls, and
with the expose by the press of the man
ner in -which valuable land had been sold
for a mere song the court set aside the
order of sale on the next day.
The complaint alleges that the order of
February 1 setting aside all previous pro
ceedings and the order fixing February
11 as the date for hearing the return of
sale were not filed until February 11, thus
rendering it impossible for the heirs or
any one else to know of the confirmation.
The complaint alleges that the vacating
ordeft- and order of return for confirmation
of sale were not entered In the records
of the court and no prior notice of the
confirmation was made to any one.
Court Documents Suppressed.
On December 28, 1900. Drinkhouse was
ordered by Judge Troutt to sell by auction
the land in Kein County, and notices of
sale were published. The notice of sale
was first published on January 5 of the
present year. On January 31 last Drink
house Hied a return of sale, claiming to
have sold the property to H. Bohls for
$2000.
On February 1 Judge Troutt set aside
all previous proceedings in the matter
and Drinkhouse' filed another return of
sale to H. Bohls for $2000. The court then
fixed February 11 as the date for the
hearing of the return and the confirma
tion of the same.
Sold Land for $2000.
The complaint sets forth that Giovanni
Cuoco, otherwise known as John Cook,
died on September 24, 1899, in San Fran
cisco, and that J. A. Drinkhouse was ap
pointed administrator of the estate on
November 1 following. On November 27,
IKK), Drinkhouse filed an inventory of
Cuoco's estate, which included 160 acres
of land in the McKittrick oil fields, in
Kern County. It is alleged that, the ap
praisement of <he land was made by per
sons who never set eyes on, the property.
The absent .heirs, all of whom are in
Italy, are the brothers and nephews of
Cuoco, deceased, and In their complaint,
through Consul Serra, their attorney in
fact, they tell a remarkable story of how
property worth many thousands of dol
lars was sold for a nominal sum.
The absent, heirs of Cuoco, represented
by. Italian Consul Serra, in" a complaint
filed in Los Angeles charge former Public
Administrator John A; Drinkhouse and
Attorney A. Ruef with having suppressed
the recording_of documents In the admin
istration of the estate left by Cuoco, and
further charge that T. Bacigalupi, D. Ca
nale.-M. C. Wagy and Attorney Charles
G- Lamberson practiced fraud and deceit
in inducing Italian Consul Serra to sell
the real property of Cuoco for a nominal
sum. . â¢
Proceedings before Superior Judge
Troutt in the litigation over the estate of
Giovanni Cuoco, otherwise known as John
Cook, were brought to a sensational stop
yesterday morning by the mandate of the
Circuit Court of the United States for the
Ninth Circuit, Southern District of Cali
fornia.

Police Officers and Military Officials
Making Every Effort to De
termine Truth of
INVESTIGATION
OF RIO WRECK
Herzog says he will remain away from
the Presidio for a week or so in the hope
that those who took part In the riot will
leave in that time. He has been advised
by friends, however to transact his busi
ness by proxy, as the soldiers never for
get an injury, whether real or fancied.
No arrests hare been made since the
trouble began. The Police Department is
investigating the charges made by the
soldiers, and the military officials are do
ing everything m their power to find out
if there Is any reason for the numerous
complaints made. "
Extra precautions were taken last
night by the military authorities to pre
vent the soldiers burning, as they threat
ened, the property of Herzog. An armed
guard was sent to the corner of Green
wich and Lyon streets just after retreat,
and the members of the guard, with the
assistance of the police, under Sergeant
Harper, kept the soldiers moving. By
10:30 o'clock there was hardly a man to
be seen on the street.
N. K. Herzog, whose business dealings
with 'the soldiers* have caused id much
trouble, does not dare to make an ap
pearance at hi3 store. He la compelled to
entrust his business to clerks, who are
working under conditions that render
their position dangerous. The soldiers
congregate in the neighborhood of the
pawnshop, and while they make no overt
movement it can plainly be seen from
their demeanor that they have not forgot
ten the treatment afforded their comrade.
The proprietor of the store is kept posted
by means of tha telephone, as his appear
ance among the soldiers would precipitate
the outbreak that is threatened.
A great many* of the sVdlers who took
part in the ' riots of Sunday and Monday
nights departed yesterday for Manila, but
they left behind them tales of the evil
doings of the storekeepers that will be
told to the newcomers. The result of all
these stories is awaited with anxiety by
the merchants/and the military authori
ties know of no way to prevent the im
pending trouble.
There is trouble in store for the keepers
of the shops near the entrance to the
Presidio. The events of the last few
nights have sharpened the appetites of
the soldiers foe revenge, and unless pre
caution is taken it is feared that the
neighborhood of the military reservation
will witness scenes of destruction and
strife. '-':-'Â¦Â¦ .;-'.' :' :
Pilot Commission Inquiry
Into Jordan's Conduct ,
Begins,
Jordan also requested that R. H. Long
of Petaluma, who was a passenger on the
Rio, be called as a witness, together with
George Seaman of the steamer Czarina.'
The commission decided that other, wit
nesses than those who had been "previous
ly : examined might be called, and the
meeting was therefore postponed without
further action till Wedncsda* morning, in
order that time might te given for con
sideration of the names or those wl oss
testimony may be of value. ,.
Jordan was asked If he wished to be
represented by : an attorney, but he re
fused, saying that all he wanted was a
thorough and Impartial investigation in
which iiB: felt he would be entirely freed
from blame for tho disaster. Â¦
The only witness called yesterday morri
ingr was Port Captain Barber. Mr. Barber
testified as to Jordan's previous service,
his excellent character and sober habits.
Pilot Jordan, he said, had always been
careful and reliable. ; Some objection was
made to the presence of Attorney McAl â¢
ister and he volunteered to leave, but it
was finally decided that. he' should re
main, as he said his purpose in attending
the investigation was purely In the line of
business. The Pacific Mail has many law
suits on its hands as a result of the
wreck, and it is a matter of some impor
tance to the company as to who shall be
declared officially responsible in the mat
ter. ' . ,-.V ...:,-,,,-< ; - ./
Secretary Eddie Conroy of the Pilot
Commissioners stated the purpose of the
meeting and | said that the investigation.
was to be conducted in the most impartial
manner. Captain Alexander -then told
Jordan publicly that if tho commission de
cided that he was In any way responsible
for the sad accident the only course open
to the members was to dismiss him from
the service. If In that case Jordan should
feel that he had been, unjustly dealt with
he could appeal to the civil courts for
exoneration. If, however, the commission
should find that Jordan was In no way re
sponsible for the loss of the Rio he would
be restored to his former position, from
which he Is now suspended awaiting the
result of the investigation, and no further
action would be deemed necessary. " r
The State Board of Pilot Commissioners
met at Its rooms on Battery street yester
day rnorning 1 ' for '. the purpose of making
an investigation as to Pilot Frederick "W.
Jordan's responsibility for the Rio do Ja
neiro disaster. Commissioners R. S. Alex
ander, Charles Pratt and "William Leale
were all present, together with Pilot Jor
dan and Attorney McAllister, represent
ing the Pacific Mail Company.

NEW YORK. March IS.â The course of events
in lact week's stock rs&rket led up to to-day's
excitement on the Stock Exchange. The pow
erful professional ppeculators who had been
manipulating prices for an advance for a long
time taw the proml3Â« of their reward In the
growing outside interest In the market. The
relief afforded by Saturday's bank statement
pa.-, a pretty good assurance of an Increased de
mand for stocks this mor&lng. The public
appetite was whetted by several announce
ments, which either came very opportunely for
the purpose or were set afloat with a view of
their eSect. One of the greatest difficulties
which the professional bulls have had to con
tend with tu the dragging tendency cf the
rteel clocks, under the apprehension that when
th<Â» new United States Steel Corporation Flocks
ere Introduced on the Stock Exchange they
may prove weak and have an unsettling in
fluence on the general market. The report that
the Rockefeller lrcn interests In the Lake Su
prlor region were to be Included In the steel
merger therefore proved very opportune for
the bulls and awakened the steel stocks from
their dormant state Intc strength and activity.
It was very difficult to tecure any authoritative
confirmation of the transaction and no details
were vouchsafed of the terms or whether any
Increase in the propos<*C capital Issue of the
great eteel corporation was Involved. The
rtock of that corporation was active and buoy
ant in the curb rr.arka: in sympathy with the
movements of other stocks on the exchange.
There was a continuance of the excited specu
lation In Burlington on the publication of the
circumstantial assertions that President J. J.
Hill of the Great Northern had secured con
trol cf the Burlington. Burlington's insiders
were inclined to deprecate these assertions.
IcivlEg color to the belief that competitive buy
ing for control was suing on. It was confi
dentially 6tated that the New Tork Central
had secured control of the Manhattan and
would guarantee a dividend of 6 per cent.
This Ftaterr.ent received an emphatic denial
from the president of the New York Central.
General Electric's advance was an outgrowth
of the supposition that the new control of the
Manhattan would hasten Its electrical equip

EASTERN MARKETS.
The leading futures ranged ss follows
CHICAGO. March 18.â May wheat opened %@
54c lower at 77Hc to.76%c. with long Interests
endeavoring to rid themselves of holdings,
which suddenly became worthless to them
when they summed up the situation early.
Liverpool failed to reflect Saturday's advance
here. To this potent consideration were added
heavy world"s shipments, a big Increase on
passage and liberal receipts at spring wheat
points. To make the situation more bearish,
Nebraska reported that the condition of wheat
In that State was 14 per cent better than at
the same period a year ago. A remnant of the
bull force rallied to the support of the market
and succeeded In causing a rally to 77tt@7"'4c
following the opening. Desertion from their
already thinned ranks soon rendered further
resistance useless, as outside aid which had
been hoped for failed to materialize. The heavy
primary receipts, small seaboard clearances
a.pd disappointingly light visible decrease to
gether with the lack of export inquiry, were
Influences which struck the market after It
had declined %<\ and many sold out Longs
were reported to have sold short under 77c.
Under this pressure May slumped to 76c. It
took all* forenoon to accomplish this decline
The trade had been excited and large. At the
bottom transactions fell off In volume and the
pit became more quiet for spot. Shorts took
profits and the market rallied to 76Hc, but
closed heavy at IVic lower at 76%c.
The corn market enjoyed a fair portion of at
tention, displaying a firmness which was con
spicuous In comparison with the weakness In
the neighboring wheat pit. May closed UÂ©Uo
lower at 41%Â©41Â»/4c. The July option attracted
considerable attention and ruled Uc over May
Oats were moderately active and ateady lri
sympathy with corn and on a fair cash de
mand. May closed He lower at 25V4C
Provisions nhowed some uneasiness early on
the liberal run of hogs at the local yards, but
a good cash demand and the fact that receipts
at the chief Western markets showed a falling
oft* from last year caused a rally later, and the
close was firm. May pork closed 20c higher-
May lard closed 7>4c up," and May ribs closed
7>4c Improved.

The following ere the seasonal rainfalls to
Â«IU.te, as compared with those of^eame date
last season, and rainfall In last twenty-four
hours :
â¢â¢Apricots are in better demand, a very fair
trade beinc reported in some quarters yester
day- The market, however, is easy. Peaches
are selling only in a small way. Figs are
having a fair eale. Apples on the epot con
tinue quiet. A little business is heard of In
choice prods at S'sc. New crop apples are be
frinntnjc to attract attention. Prime are cf
ler^d for October-November delivery at 6c. A
rale Â»aÂ« reported made at that price, but
this could not be positively confirmed."
Weather Report.
"On the coast the situation is *ai<J to be
Crclfledly stronger and there are reports that
the Cured Fruit As5ocir.tl.on has finally 6ecured
control of all outside goods and that hence
forth It will be impoesilile to buy at cut prices.
There fÂ«mf a lark of offerings from California
at the pri<"'* which have prevailed right along,
a cirtumFtar.ee which seems- confirmatory of
this report. However, as the trade bought
<iuite freely two weeics aÂ£O at the low prices
then ottered by outsiJers the alleged buying
by the association caut>e* less interest here
than might otherwise have been the case.
â¢"Prune* continue firm on epot, particularly
4Q-r/*. 50-O* and ?^Â»-70s, which are scarce.
Fifties are *>*pecia!!v r-Ciirce. many dealers be
ingr entirely out. There Is a. eood Inquiry for
O-70s and for SO-Joes. The very small sixes
ar* wanted a'.so. Borne of the prunes recently
r>urrhased on the cojet at about a 2c basis
ere beginning to arrive, and these should re
ltf>vÂ«> the scarcity and give the market a suf
ficient surrly fcr ronH t'mÂ«.
Ma!l cSi-iees from New Tcrk tay: "It Is
Â£:fficu!t to say Just what the epot market on
California raisins is, ln&rmuch as there is vir
tually no flemand. Unquestionably, however,
the recent cut on thÂ« coast on export prices
has greatly unsettled the local market, and,
though reluctant to admit It. holders are dls
pufted. Two-crown .ind 3-crown loose mus
catels unfloubtedly can be bought Uc lower
than ten days ago. There was a rumor of a

Cooper Held for Trial.
Assistant District Attorney Whltlr?
submitted the case without further argu
ment and Judge Fritz, after telling Coop
er to stand up, decided that there wa*
ample evidence to warrant holding tho
prisoner for trl^I in the Superior Court
on a charge of forging a telegram with
intent to defraud Nora Schneider. Bail
was fixed in the sum of $5000.
The second charge against. Cooper, that
of forging a seal of a court of record, was
then called, but as the prosecutidn was
not ready to go on with the case. It was
adjourned until this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The engagement ring which Cooper
bought with money obtained by fraud is
now in the hands of Captain of Detectives
Seymour. When Nora Schneider returned
the ring to Cooper he pawned it for S^.
though it is worth $100. Cooper, after his
arrest, gave an order to his attorney to
redeem the ring, but Captain Seymour
had already obtained* possession of It.
Captain Colvllle of Crockett, who lndorse.l
Cooper's bogus note, will have, to reim
burse the Donohoe-Kelly Bank the
amount of money they paid out on Coop
er's checks and the .ring will be returned
to Cclville. | . .
Cooper's attorney ! claims that If Miss
Schneider files suit for divorce it will be
contested. The prisoner is afraid of the
I testimony of his dupe and has Instructed
h.s attorney to take every step to prevent
the admission of her evidence. If Nora
I Schneider, should be granted a divorce
she could then appear against the scoun
drel who now claims her as his wife.
As it will take some time for Nora
Schneider to secure a divorce. Cooper will
try to secure his release by a â¢writ* of
habeas corpus in the next few days, as
he dreads the possibility of his victim be
ing allowed to appear against him in the
Superior Court.

WASHINGTON, March 18.â The State
Department is giving renewed attention to
the settlement of the claims against the
Government of Morocco. '.The. claim -of
Marcus^ Ezagui, who was murdered at

Courtroom Is Crowded.
SETTLERS RUSH
FOR NEW HOMES
â¢ The usual big crowd was present at the
preliminary examination in the police
court yesterday and Cooper was again
the center of attraction. The ex-convict
had lost considerable of his bravado and
his soiled collar and cuffs betrayed the
end of his financial resources.
Judge Fritz, after calling the case, de
cided that Nora Schneider could not tes
tify against the prisoner and that the bur
den of proof that she was not the wife of
Cooper rested with the prosecution.
The District Attorney's office had hoped
to introduce the evidence of Cooper's lat?
est victim, and while it was shown that
Cooper was a married man In 1S97. It was
not prepared to prove that he was not en
titled to enter into marriage with Nora
Schneider. >'--
Mrs. Schneider and her daughter Mamie
both testified that on the night before
Cooper trapped Nora into marriage, he
had been told by Nora and her mother
that no wedding would take place. On
that evening Nora had returned her en
gagement ring to Cooper, the ling having
been purchased with money obtained lÂ»y
fraud from the Donohoe-Kelly Bank.
Mrs. Schneider also testified that her
daughter Nora had on the evening of
February 22 and on many previous occa
sions told Cooper that she would not
marry him without her mother's consent.
Attorney Murphy then made a short ar
gument on behalf of the prisoner and
asked for a dismissal of' the case on the
ground that there was no evidence itq
show that Nora Schneider had been de
frauded by reason of the false telegram
cent to her by Cooper. _
"A woman's affections cannot be stolen
or obtained by fraud as property might
be" said Murphy, "and there is not a
particle of evidence to show that Nora

ments if the rates were allowed to stand.
Referring to his offer made during the in-'
vestl nation ~ that ' the â¢ company would ex
pend $465,000 " if : the" old rates were re-en
acted. Â¦ Engineer Schussler said that he
had been coaxed into making that;prom
ise by Supervisor .Reed at a dinner in
Â¦which ' Schussler > -was Reed's â¢ guest.
Schussler. evaded. -the issue by.- claiming
that the offer had' not been accepted, as
he had not made it to the board, having
been , excluded , from ; the . caucus at : which
the; rates were fixed.;' After; a great deal
of parrying Schussler said: â¢ Â¦-.-Â¦ Â¦'
-'!We will agree to fill every requirement
contained in the report of Fire Chief Sulli
van within the next two fiscal years, pro
vided >Â¦ the city will continue to pay $3 per
month for each hydrant.'." â¢ ..
v After the City Attorney's opinion that
the board has no right ' to compel the
Spring Valley Company 'to lay new mains
had been read, Comte moved the refer
ence of the ordinance to the joint com
mittee on judiciary and water, with a
view to secure an agreement from the
corporation to provide additional fire pro
tection. Braunhart objected and made an
allusion to what he termed a conspiracy,
'when he was sharply called to order by
Comte. Braunhart apologized and modi
fled his ' charge by saying that there ap
peared to be a clearly defined conspiracy
on the part of come' one. not on the board,
to allow, the' rates to remain undisturbed
oh the pretext of acquiring additional fire
protection. -Stafford said that the City
Attorney had not decided the point at Is
sue. The Supreme Court. . he 'said, had
held that the company was obliged to fur
nish sufficient water for great public ne
cessities. '- ,â¢
>Â¦ Connor. urged the passage of the ordin
ance on the ground Â¦Â¦ that it would sav*
$140,000 in taxes, which caused Reed to re
mark sarcastically that the matter of fire
protection Is of far greater importance
than the. saving of $140,000, which instead
of being spent for . public Â¦ Improvements
would probably Â¦â¢â¢ be expended Â» for .- higher
salaries In the Board or Works -or Health
Board. â..;
After a stormy, session, which lasted
exactly two hours, the water rate ordin
ance was defeated on final passage by the
Board of Supervisors yesterday, though
the measure was passed - to print two
weeka ago. The proceedings were enliv
ened by two incidents. One of these was
a wild charge of â¢ conspiracy to re-enact
the existing ictes made by Braunhart,
though he accused no one in particular,
which was vigorously resented by Comte.
The other, was the expressed disinclina
tion of .Chief Engineer Schussler of-th*'
water company Â¦ to be insulted when he
was charged by Brandenstein with, having
broken his agreement -tq expend $165,000 In
laying new mains.

ER, alias Dr. Ernest Moore Chad

in the Superior Court by Police
Judge Fritz on a charge of having
forged a telegram with intent to deceive
and defraud Nora Schneider of Crockett,
Cal., who was induced by the notorious
ox-convict to enter into a morriage with
him on" February 23 last.
Cooper's conceit and persistency were
once again shown when, at the close of
the court proceedings yesterday, he wrote
a note to the young woman he had po
basely duped. With the knowledge that
Nora Schneider is fully cognizant of his
true character. Cooper penned her a let
ter, couched in most endearing terms.
The young â¢woman refused to receive the
letter from the hand of the court attache
who offered the missive to her, arid when
it was thrown over the railing of "the
room where she was standing by
Cooper, the letter was cast to the florr
by Mrs. Schneider. ; Miss Schneider gave
pcrmlsion to a newspaper reporter to
open the letter, which was addressed to
"Mrs. Nora Chadwlck," and read as fol
lows:
Darlirp Wife: I must we you at your earliest

love, believe me. Your loving husband.

home are simple. All that is required is
that the applicants be destitute and of
good moral character. They roust be 60
years of age or over. No distinction is
made regarding creed or nationality. The
sisters of the order devote themselves en
tirely to the care of the aged and destitute
poor of both sexes. We provide the aged
poor and destitute with food and clothing
and In the time of sickness nursq and
watch over them. All donations of money,
food or clothing will be gratefully ac
cepted and the prayers of the community
will be daily offered for our benefactors."
The "Little Sisters of the . Poor? now

are about 4600 members in the sisterhood.
Two sisters accompanied the mother pro
vincial here, and six or eight more sisters
will reach here before the end of April.

Â¦When an old. experienced drugsist ad-

about the heart, and when night "came I
looked forward to a good night's rest. I
was also free from headaches and sour
stomach that had been with me for years
before.,. In fact I was a new man and Im-
proved bo rapidly in health that I went
up to 220 pounds.
"I am enjoying as good health as I
over did in my life and" no healthier man
can be found I tirmly believe.
"â¢Durins: the past winter I was out of
doors every day and we had some yerv
prvcre woather. Those who worked with
me and used coffee and tea and other
kinds of liquid beverages were constantly
complaining of the cold. I did not Buffer
in the least, nor did I contract a bad cold
during the entire winter.

deathly color, but ehe went on Grape-Jfutt

BEAIi ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
WASHINGTON, March 18.â Tha State
Department/through Minister Loomis, re
cently lodged a most vigorous . protest * to
the Venezuelan Government -against fur
ther; interference with Mr. Baiz, â¢ the
United States Consul agent at Barcelona,
Venezuela. It knows nothing of the last
reported infringement . of his liberty, but
it Is presumed the affair Is connected di
rectly Nwith - the troubles which led. to
the first protest. . ' f
Â¦ Ignatlo M. Baiz is not a citizen of tho
United, States, a fact that may add to tha
difficulty which our Government will ex
perience in protecting him, as it is deter
mined to show he was born in St. Thomas
and is a Danish citizen as far as Is knowr<
here, but having an exequatur issued by
the Venezuelan Government recognizing
film as a United : States consular agent,
the State Department, has decided that he
is entitled to the protection of the United
States Government. It appears that he is
engaged in business and became Involved
in trouble : with -the Venezuelan? military
by resisting an attempt to collect a forced

Scared Away by the Noise of the Ex

PRESCQTT, Ariz.. March 18.â The gen
eral merchandise store of J. I. Gardiner
â¢was entered by burglars at 2 o'clock this
morning. After robbing the cash register
of $25 they turned their attention to the.
safe. One of the rivets of the door was
drilled out and. a charge of dynamite ex
ploded In the hole. The door was sprung
by the explosion sufficiently to allow of
the Introduction of a crowbar and with
this the door was pried open further ariu
another charge of dynamite inserted
hind it -and exploded. The door was com
pletely demolished, but the noise was so
great that the thieves were frightened
and decamped without attempting to se
cure the contents of the safe.
to Make Appearance.
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., March 18.â After
a long hearing in the Probate Court, Judge
Nobbs to-night denied the application of
Edward Percival and Edward L. Norton
for appointment as administrators of the
estate of the late millionaire, George P.
Gllman. Mrs. Helen Hall made no appear
ance to-day, either In person or by coun
sel.
As yet the mystery surrounding the card
which Mrs. Helen Hall Is to play in the
game, which has as its stake the property
of the millionaire tea merchant. Is unre
vealed. Mrs. Hall was again asked to-day
as to her position and the nature of her
claim, but she declined to say a wor-1.
There was a rumor, however, that she had
a deed to the mansion in Black Rock and
other property. The rumor Is said to have
originated with Miss Susie Kupfer, a
young violinist, whom Mr. Gllman sent
to Europe to perfect her education in
music, but both Miss Kupfer and her
mother denied the authorship of the story.

IN THE OILMAN CASE
EL PASO. Tex.. March IS.â Ten years
ago pretty little six-year-old Anna Stev
ens of this city disappeared -vrlth a man
and woman who were supposed to have
stolen her. They were a childless couple
and took the little one because they had
become attached to her while she tempo
rarily resided with them. All efforts of,
the police to locate the missing child
proved futile, and the incident went on
record as an unsolved mystery. The
mother, a widow, lost hope of ever seeing
her child again. She remarried and re-,
moved to the interior of Old Mexico.
To-day the mystery was cleared up
when a dispatch came stating* that the
missing child had been discovered at Dan
ville, 111., In the person of a beautiful
girl of 16, who was accompanied by an
actress who claimed to be her guardian.
The authorities Interfered and the girl is
on her way to El Paso.
Meantime the kidnaped girl's sister
had a similar experience. She married,
and her babe was given to a nurse. The
young mother separated from her hus
band and sued out a writ of habeas cor
pus to recover the child. The Judge gave
it to her and sent the Sheriff, who seized
the infant, brought it into court and de
livered lt to the mother. The mother of
the kidnaped girl married "Jim" Kuch,
who was badly wounded while robbing a
train. He died in prison.

Sustained applause greeted Mr. Short
ridge as he rose. So great was the en
thusiasm that it was several minutes be
fore he could proceed. In introducing his
Eubject the speaker styled the day one of
sad memories, one for proud recollection;
a day to weep and a day to rejoice; a
day of meditation and a day of hope.
He cited St. Patrick's example as note
worthy in that he converted a whole peo
ple without the shedding of a drop of
blood. The conversion was one that
lasted. Ireland did not relapse into pa
ganism, as England did. It was in real
ity Ireland which christianized England.
The history of Irelafcd was then briefly
but masterfully sketched from the day of
Brian the Brave to recent events. It was
when he reached the days of 179S that the
speaker really reached the hearts of hi3
assemblage. They cheered the name of
conclusion of his address introduced the
orator of the day, Samuel M. ShortridgÂ«.
"Ireland never sought to cut loose from
the British empire. She only wanted
"In 1798," said the orator, "there wero
men who thought it a privilege to fight
for their country. There were not a few
of them, but higher, more glorious than
all others are the names of Wolfe Tone
and Robert Emmet. Some day it may
fall to your lot to stand on the slab which
marks the burial place. of Wolfe Tone
and read inscribed thereon the noble
deeds of his life.. If ever you do the same
words will rise unon your lips as were
ever upon his, "God bless Ireland."
Emmet, they gloried in every mention of
Grattan, Wolfe Tone brought them to
tfceir f*et. but curiously, perhaps, the
most applauded name amengr all- those
cited as workers for Ireland's liberty was
that of William Ewart Gladstone.

President O'Gara advanced to the front
of the platform and delivered a brief ad

Â«1ay. He rpoke -with hope of what the

day. The gxeat barn-like structure was
packed to suffocation with enthusiastic
and perspiring patriots, who. In spite of
the allurements of cloudless skies and de
lightful weather outside, had felt that the
purpose and duty of the day was to pay
tribute to the memory of the patron saint
of Ireland and to revive recollections of
the dear oM Emerald Isle Itself.
The exercises were set for 1 o'clock, but
the members of the committee who occu

"The story of Ireland is a sad and
lamentable one," said he. "but a brighter
and more glorious day is now dawning.

bright, green isle of the ocean, but she
has failed. .The Irish people have been
persecuted and abused, but their faith
has never^- wavered.

Asmussen, told of ttt. triumphs and sor
rows of ! . Ireland. After giving a word
painting of the present conditions exist
ing in Ireland Mr.' Asmussen predicted
that the long-suffering country will soon
be able to take her proper place among
the nations of the earth.
The address of welcome was delivered
by O'Gara, chairman of the St.
Patrick's day convention. After paying
a 'high .-tribute to tho Irish race he said
that it afforded him great pleasure to
welcome the masses who had assembled
to do honor to the memory of the patron
saint of the Emerald Isle:
The evening exercises In honor of St.
Patrick's day were held in Mechanics'
Pavilion, and were attended by fully 8000
people. The large hall was appropriately
decorated with the insignia of Erin and
the national colors of America. It was a
responsive audience. The stereoptlcon
views of Ireland elicited the hearty ap
plause of the audience and each patriotic
air or Irish melody played by the band
evoked rounds of applause. >;

and applause - by its amusing and thrill
ing situations.
"But with all this, yet I say that if
there was ever a people on earth who had
a right to be free it is the Irish people.
One word more and I have done. My
friends, there is no such thing as death.
The body perishes, but that which thinks
and aspires and loves does not die. For
such lives as those of Ireland's martyrs
there is no death. Yonder they stand at
"Oh! it has been a sad story! Along
with her other misfortunes Ireland has
had famine, desolation, till it seemed that
God himself had turned his back on her.
"The union (so called) brought little re
lief or improvement, but In 1803 there was
another noble heart willing to give of Its
blood for Ireland, and that heart beat
within the breast of Robert Emmet.
Robert Emmet! Wherever there shall
be a heart that beats to the transports of
freedom that name must ever be dear
above any other. Robert Emmet
mounted the scaffold and looked .calmly
Into the .grave.. But do you think the
spirit of liberty died with Robert Em

him to the grave the cause of liberty was
destroyed? No! There rose up after him
the voice of the liberator of Ireland. Dan
iel O'Connell. All these princelings and
lcrdlings were seized with panic at the
voice of this God-like man. But it was
not until 1829 that the Catholic could have
a voice in making the laws of his coun

Father Yorke was warmly welcomed
when he stepped upon the stage. The
hall, tastefully decorated, was packed to
Its utmost capacity. Upon the stage were
seated a large number of the clergy and
many prominent citizens.- Father Yorke
was frequently interrupted by applause
his reference to local political conditions
one of his most pungent points, beinsr
rapturously received. 5
; "During the famine of 1847 there was
nothing between the population and star
vation. The .landlords grabbed all and ex
ported grain from Ireland during that
year on which the duties paid would have
kept alive the 2.000,000 souls that died, and
saved the blight with its horrors. The as
sistance offered by the Sultan of Turkey
was refused because he had given
more than the gracious lady whose
praises we sing In 'God Save the Queen.'
A curse of God to thee and thine and the
memories of those who did these two mil
lions to death."
"No Minister or Cabinet could stand
against the Queen's will. So she must
take the responsibility of all the acts of
her. reign. For every good thing the
English Government did, give her credit.
For every bad thing give discredit to her
Ministers. Government does not exist
alone for the officeholders. The British
Idea of governing Ireland Is that her peo
ple are not capable of governing them
selves.
"History will judge of the past and un
der Its pitiless scrutiny shall there be for
mulated a judgment from which' there will
be no appeal. There Is a criminal at
tempt to separate the lady and the Queen.
As a private individual she attended to
her business and her children, had no
fits of extravagance and knew that cents
made the dollar. It Is said that whatever
has been done by England to the Irish
people should not be charged to her. This
is a dishonest attempt to shift the burdens
of responsibility. No one can escape the
duties of government so long as they are
In power; and so long must they stand for
what is done under them or in their name.
"Two events have made our days rather
remarkable," he said. "One was the close
of the century and the other the death of
Queen Victoria. Her reign was protracted
over two-thirds of a century and St. Pat
rick's day furnishes a fitting occasion to
review the events which have made that
past century bo remarkable.
"We are Irish of the Irish. Our loyalty
Is anything save bending the kmse and
singing 'God Save the Queen.' Rather
would we sinff 'God Save Ireland.' There
are about 8000 Irish voters on the great
registers, brt I am waiting to see a gath
ering of them to condemn the action taken
by our authorities. We have many so
cieties In our midst, yet only -one of these
has spoken in unmeasured terms."
Reviewing the history of the Irish race
Father. Yorke dwelt upon the history of
that country during the reign of Queen
Victoria, dilating upon the grievances of
her people. The famine of 1S47, with all
its horrors, was vividly pictured.
"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness are three of the cardinal principles of
our Government," he said. "How did or
how do the Irish people enjoy them? It
Is necessary for a nation to enjoy these
three attributes which are vouchsafed to
all free people. We must not only con
sider this question in the bitterness of
our hearts, but consider it publicly. No
one "can accuse the Anglo-Saxon of mod
esty. It Is now time for us to speak. As
a race, England is our enemy as she was
before Ireland "was subjugated.
"Every eulogy on the dead Queen is a
condemnation of our people. Either "we
are the victims of chronic injustices or we
are a most unfortunate people. We are
bound to speak out and show the people of
the world that when we refuse to sing
'God Save the Queen' we have justification
for our act. and must proclaim in no un
certain tones, 'God Save Ireland.'
So spoke Father Yorke last night at
Metropolitan Temple. It was his first ap
pearance as an orator on St.- Patrick's
day. The occasion was an entertainment
for the benefit of the parish of St. Charles
Borromeo out in the Mission district. The
title of the reverend lecturer's v discourse
was "God Save the Queen."
: There was no mistaking the allusion
made by Father Yorke. He began his ad
dress by reviewing the principal events
that made the reign of Queen Victoria
noted throughout the world.
"Are the Irish In San Francisco to liken
themselves to the tin can that Is dragged
at the tall of a little yellow dog? Flags
at half mast on municipal buildings and
school children singing 'God Save the
Queen' Is 'the example shown us by the
little descendant of an Irish king, p Fie
upon you, men of the Celtic race. It Is a
poor politician that cannot barter civil or
uncivil service examinations."

In the vast retail establishments of large cities, many
w.omen are employed as saleswomen.
Men formerly held the positions that women now hold,
and while women's organism is less strong than men's, they
are expected to do the same "v^ork. Their duties compel them
to be on their feet from morning to night, and many of them,
in a short time, contract those distressing complaints called
"female diseases."
Then occur irregularities, suppressed or painful menstra- I
ation, weakness, indigestion, leucorrhcea, general debility, 1
and nervous prostration. |
They are beset with such symptoms as dizziness, faint- 1
ness, lassitude, excitability, irritability, nervousness, sleep- |
lessness, melancholy, " all-gone " and '* want- to-be-left-alone " I
feelings, blues, and hopelessness. â¢ 1^3
In such cases there is one tried and true remedy. Lydia l
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound at once removes 1
such troubles. The following letters prove this. They also j
prove the value of Mrs. Pinkham's advice. |
" Deai*. Mrs. Pinkham : â I take pleasure in trriting yon a few lines |
thanking' yon for yonr advice. I did jnst as you told me in taking 1 yonr . S
medicine, and owe my life to you. You are like a mother to your sex. I I
was awfully sick, was all run down and felt sick all over. I looked like a I
person brought ont of the g_rave. My face was as white as the driven snow. 9
I was always tired after doing a little work and wonld have to sit down. H
I was troubled terribly with headaches and my appetite was not good; |
also, troubled with shortness of breath something awful for about a month. |
I could not go up one flight of stairs without beinff tired and having to Â§
stop to get my breath. I was feeling just as miserable as could be. I took a
two bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound |
and cannot express my thanks to you for what your medicine has done for |
me."â MISS M. F., 35 Devon St., Grove Hall, Eoxbury, Boston, Mass. |

Compound has done me a great deal of good. J have taken threo 1

cine I was hardly able to be up ; could not do half a day's work. I ached R
