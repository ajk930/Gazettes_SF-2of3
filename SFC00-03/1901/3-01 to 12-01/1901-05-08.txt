COMMITTEE BUSY
ON FINAL PLANS
W'HILE the members. of thei Presidential party are feasting their
.eyes on the verdure of spnny. fertile Southern California after a
dreary trip, across the desert and are listening to the plaudits of a
people enthusiastically "determined that no welcome shall outvie
theirs,' hundreds of busy men and women in San' Francisco will be
working with the industry of beavers, intent upon perfecting the
arrangements for the local reception, which", "they say, must and shall.be the
greatest of them all in every respect.
The executive committee, will hold an important meeting at 11 o'clock this morn
ing. Thechairmen of the various sub-committees will make detailed reports, and
RHOENIX, Ariz., May 7.â The trip of -the Presidential
party to Congress, Ariz., to visit the Congress mines,
was the most adventurous^and thrilling of' th# entire
. journey. v ; In point of 'novelty "and excitement no other
" place yet visited", will- compare with this.
-. . . ; /Congress is about seventy miles north of Phoenix,
and tlie principal line here is owned by E. P3.' Gage, F.- M.
Murphy, D.JI. Ferry, the Detroit seed man, and N. K. "Fair-,
banks. The town is 1000 feet above the sea and the mine is
located far above the town. The members of the Presidential
party, accompanied by Mr. Gage, t^he president Â¦ of the mine.
| went part of the way up the mountain in a railroad' train, the
balance of the distance being made afoot. The President hfrn
self headed the long line of travelers winding up. the mountain
paths. The scene was so strange that the photographers of
ihe party begged the President many times to pose for them,
and he did eo. At one time he started toward a cactus tree
to stand. in front of it to have his picture taken. He stumbled
on a rock, and. in reaching out to catch something his right
"iar.d came in contact with the needles of a gigantic cactus
tree. His hand was painfully pricked. Several people - assisted Â¦
in removing the sharp points.
Before the train reached Congress the President had
evinced a desire to go down into the deepest shaft at the mine,
a distance cf over 2000 feet into the bowels of the earth. Mem
bers of the party urged him not to do so, saying that if any
thing should happen to him blame would always rest on the
other members of the party for not opposing the project: The
President agreed with his friends and so did not go down into
j the shaft. He stood at the mouth of the deep hole and watched
the others start down, telling them good-by as the lit le incline
cars began to disappear out'of sight. -All the members of the
party except Mrs. McKinley and Secretary Wilson went down
into the shaft. Miss Hitchcock, ' Miss Barber, Miss' Wilson,
Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Hay, Mrs. Cortelyou, Mrs. Moore and
Mrs. Rixey exhibited the greatest pleasure in the feat they, had
performed. Â¦ . â¢ N
President Traverses Deep Tunnel in Mine^
The President accomplished a daring feat, however./ From
the mouth of the shaft where the party went down is a deep,
dark tunnel leading, across under the mountain to the mill,
where the ore is crushed. .Accompanied by. Mr.' Gage, the .
President walked briskly through this tunnel. At times he
was 1500 feet below the' surface of the earth; ' The tunnel had
an occasional canJle burning along its sides, but these gave Â¦
practically no light. The track of a little tramway guided the
President in his movements. â¢ . . * ' .
,A few photographers were following behind the President.
Stopping at a dark place the President said* "This i3 where;
you ought to get a photograph." One of the "men wanted time,
to go. to the train for a flashlight apparatus, but the President:
would not consent to wait, and so the opportunity for . the 'Â¦
greatest picture of all was lost. '.
Emerging from the tunnel at the .mill where the ore is j
crushed and the gold separated from it, the. President was :
conducted through the building, paying close attention to 'the;
descriptions of. the workings... He inspected the cyanide work's :
and saw cast a bar of. gold worth 528,000. The President was â¢
much interested, and asked if he could not see the bar, "It is â¢
redhot," said Mr. Gage. "I will show it," shouted one of Â¦'the j
melters, a man named Richmond, stepping forward! and with \
only the protection of a. few rags for his hands he seized : the ;
redhot mold and dumped the white-hot bar of glowing metal
upon, the stone. The rags were ignited by the heat and ;'the*>
young man's hands were scorched, but he did not wince.
"That is the -true American pluck," exclaimed the Prcsi- :
dent, advancing toward Richmond. "I want to shake your.
hand." He gi-asped the man's hand 'and sh^ok it cordially.
Through the Fertile. Salt River Valley. !
The President did a great deal of walking up and down the
mountain sides on the way. to the various points of interest,"
and b^e seemed to enjoy it. His wife was a little" troubled when*
he started from the car and begged the, members of the party
who were going to places of more or,less'danger to take- care
of her husband. . . . . ' Â« /
Secretary Wilsonsaid that it was in the section of Arizona;:
around Congress- . that the Department- of Agriculture some
time ago: sent some- date palms that had been secured, by the
department in Tripoli. ..He expects to hear ; good reports from Â¦
them' at an. early date; - ', .' ;
The railroad from here to, Congress was carefully . gone overf ;
by the â¢ railroad officials before the long train (of the President -
was pulled over. it. A train of an engine- and four , cars "was -
dispatched ahead "of â¢ the ; train from ; here : to ': Congress and . re- >: :
turn, so as to guard against accident. .Two engines; pulled the '
train,; but they did not run. tandem. Between the first and se'e-r
ond engines .were^ a ,-flatcar. and a', caboose.' '"' The i r failfoad ;'offl- < Â¦

dropped down^ into; the green Salt River Valley, with its way

called the gardenÂ«spot:of Arizona, and was reclaimed by irri

.that"he was not in the party. . .
Address to the School Children at Wickenburg
.The tire, of, one of the engines expanded "from the heat
on the way from Congress to Phoenix and there' was a delay
of some time. "The wire was tapped by ah operator and the
news of the delay was sent to Phoenix, which was waiting
impatiently for the coming of the party. The operator, who
tapped the wire sent a request that an engine' be sent out from
i Phoenix to relieve the crirpled engine, which the officials were
afraid would jump the- track. The train pulled along slowly
until the fres.h engine arrived. .. ' Â¦: :-. .Â¦ .
At Wickenburg, the scene of the recent gold' strike, the
train was halted' long enough to permit the President to re
ceive a visit from the school children. The children presented
, Mrs. v McKinley with a , cabinet of .specimens. The President
. thanked the children in Mrs.' McKinley's behalf and addressed
them briefly as .follows:
'. It gives me sreat pleasure to be received by the Â¦ Governor Â¦ of
'â¢- your .Territory Â¦ and to receive your wa^n welcome as we journey
toward Phoenix. It is especially pleasant to meet the children, the
boys and the girls of the public schools. Tl)erÂ» is. nothing eo essential
in a free government, resting .upon' the j:eople as education, t and I
, have, been glad to note that in your Territory broad and ' ample
are .made., .for education. The schoolhouse Â¦ is the university
out of which come' good citizens, and it. is on good 'citizenship we
must rely not only for. the present but for the ' future good and glory
of the'republic. f . .
Train Arrives at Phoenix Two Hours Late.
.'_; 'The accident to the locomotive tender delayed the" arrival of
the "train at Phoenix two hours 'and somewhat' disarranged
the programme here.V 1 Nevertheless the party received a rous
ing welcome. At the station the Territorial militia, a company
, of _, cowboys on bronchos and some of the friendly Pima''and
Maricopa Indians joined In; the wildly enthusiastic reception."
The party was driven to the Adams; Hotel; for luncheon.and
afterward was escorted to the Territorial Capitol, where the
formal exercises tool: place. ; . .Â¦ : -.-..' :'Â¦Â¦ >
Governor Murphy delivered an address of welcome, to.which
the. President responded as follows: ; Â¦ " ... â¢ â¢-.".' ".'
, "Governor, Murphjv my ; fellow* citizens: I am glad to - be
greeted here- by the Governor. of your Territory.- '. I; have* heard
a good deal about Arizona* from those of your people who come

? A Irive afterward gave the President an opportunity to see
the interesting ruins of the ancient Aztec irrigation system. At
the Indian Industrial School, four miles from Phoenix, the
Â¦_party had a glimpse of what Is being done In the way of educa
tion for the wards- of the nation. . ; Â¦ . . -. -
President McKinley spoke briefly as follows:
"'It has given me very great satisfaction to meet with the
pupils of the Phoenix Indian School. It was a very beautiful
spectacle and one which I shall long remember as I came to
the stand marching through your ranks, and. even more beau
tiful to have you assemole around me and declare as you have
that you are for one country, one language and one flag I
wish you well and bid you all good-by.
At a o'clock this afternoon the Presidential special resumed
its journey. The departure was so timed that the Colorado
E>esert and the old^basin of the Gulf of California below sea
level and barren of all vegetation would be traversed during
the night. ? The Colorado River, which is the boundary of Ari
zona, will be crossed at Yuma and the party will awake to
morrow in California.
At various places former residents of- Ohio assembled at
depots to meet the Governor,, but his Excellency, made his
first speech on the trip; at Kingman, Ariz., this : evening, just
before crossing the Colorado River, on , passing from. Arizona
into California. As the^ Ohio special pulled into Kingman a
salute waa fired. After being presented with a beautiful floral
design Governor Nash returned thanks and spoke of Ohio peo
ple in the West. He said: / \ Â¦,â¢â¢â¢ â¢>.-..* ;â¢
"While we claim citizenship In Ohio -we also claim .that
greater, and grander citizenship In our. common country. We
go to California to christen the battleship Ohio, with the cer
tain feeling. that she will ever fight for the honor of the flag
and the, honor of our common country." â¢Â¦'.-. ;

nor Nash and party passed through here on time to-night. The
Buckeyes expect to have a drive j at Riverside early in the
morning and reach Los Angeles at 1 o'clock to-morrow, where
they remain until Friday. , ' -
Everybody Is looking forward to getting â into the green
fields of California, knowing that then there will be a change
of scenery and fresh beauty at all times upon which the eyes
may feed with pleasure. The splendid hospitality of California
Is beginning before the train gets lntt> that State. Boxes of
oranges, flowers and other presents for all the members of
the party are already being received. . ,_...-..
The ride across the remainder of the desert country this
afternoon and to 7 nlght may be somewhat trying. The Presi
dent's car is protected from the dust by means of a new sys
tem of ventilation, which admits the fresh air and keeps out
the sand and dust. The ventilators were made especially for

In decorations Redlands has surpassed
herself. Wisely the people have concen
trated their efforts on Orange street, tne
principal thoroughfare, and have made
the most of It. Bands of bunting of red,
white and blue stretched from the trolley
wire Btringers obliquely to the poles,
make a series of arches that seem to close
in over the driveway like a canopy.' Lit
tle banners of red and white have flut
tered gayly all day, but to-night they
hang listless and in bunches in
the warm breeze. Just ready to flop
themselves to the President to-morrow.
For miles around the peppers and palms
have been robbed again and again of their
choicest branches, and through the
green and carnival yellow and the na
tional colors flames the red gold of the
orangesâ the jewel of Redlands. They are
everywhere, like eyes of fire peeping from
among the green branches and the flags
and the flowers fringing the arch with
their brilliant hues, and living into let
ters crying welcome to McKinley. They
are characteristically beautiful.
The arch Is typical of the products of
the Redlands section. It Is a double span
spinglng from all four corners of the
crossing, and two of its openings are
banked with green branches and white
yucca blossoms, leaving a narrow way
through which the President and his
party will pass.

that spans the crossing of Orange and
Biate streets, the last load of fragrant
pepper boughs is being scattered wherever
a bare patch shows Itself on wall or cor
r.ers. and everyone is standing on curbs
ted sidewalks suggesting, criticizing the
work.
The welcome planned for the President
ig not to be effusive, but It will be at least
heartfelt and complete. It Is stated that
for the time being Redlands is the gate
way of the State, and bo all things have
fceeen subordinated to the meeting be
tween Governor Gage and President Mc-
Klnley, which will take place In the lobby
of the Casa Loma Hotel just after the
President steps from his carriage.
The President. If his train la on time,
will arrive in Redlands "at 9 o'clock to
morrow morning. He will be met at the
station by H. H. Sinclair, chairman of
the local committee of arrangements; E.
S. Graham, president of the Redlands
Board of Trade and the Casa Loma
Hotel Company, and J. H. Bohon,
manager of the Casa Loma Hotel.
In a laudau drawn by four white
horses the President will be taken to the
hotel. Mrs. McKlnley will follow in an
other carriage, and then the other mem
bers of the party will follow in -nore car
riages, down Orange street under the
flags and banners and bunting and be
tween tufts of palm and pepper, on up the
eteep to the hotel.
Governor Gage and the Congressional
committee will be in the lobby awaiting
him, and there he will tender the Presi
dent the freedom of the great State of
California, from Oregon to Mexico and
from Nevada to the Pacific, with all she
has to offer, and with it will go a welcome
from deep down in the hearts of all her
people. Then the President will be taken
out oa the upper porcn of the building
that juts out over the driveway and from
there he will address the people of the
town. There Is room for all on the open
Â¦epace before the hotel and to-morrow it
â¢will be crowded, for all are anxious to
hear the President's first comment upon
California.
After his address the President and his
party will be taken for a drive. The way
â¢will be out Orange street, under the arch
and on into Smiley Park, then to Canyon
Creek, where the President may pause
and look down on the town of Redlands,
lying like a carpet at his feet.
The way back will be through Cajon
street, the principal residence street of
the town, and then the party will be
taken to the train.
â¢ It Is hoped that at the train the Presi
dent will make an address, but it Is
no part of the programme, and If McKin
ley does so It will be of his own notion-
He Is scheduled to leave at 12, and the
programme arranged will fill a full three
hours. It will be well spent, however, for
as she is now. decked in her best and
brightest. Redlands offers as fair a sight
as the President will see.
Governor Awaits President.
Governor Gage and his party arrived
here this evening at 11 o'clock. In the
party were the Governor, Senator Perkins
and Senator Bard; Congressmen Kahn,
Coombs, Needham. Metcalf and others,
W. F. Herrin. J. C. Stubbs of the South

and some invited tuests. SSZU
The Governor and his party were tr.et
at the station by several of the prominent

OAKLAND, May 7.â Shortly &fter the
attaches of the Oakland Free Library on
Fourteenth street opposite Washington
had closed that institution last night, fire
was discovered in the rear of the struc
ture. Immediately in the rear of the
building and fronting on Fifteenth street
an engine house is located. An alarm was
turned In. but as the fire had made con
siderable headway it was difficult to ex
tinguish it.
Considerable consternation was caused
the inmates of the City Prison In the
basement of the City Hall adjoinlns. This
building Is of wood and old, and several
streams were played on It to prevent the
flying sparks from setting it afire.
Evidently the fire In the library build
ing started in the basement from some
unknown cause. Preparations were being
made to remove to the new library build
ing and everything was in confusion. No
estimate of the damage could be made to
night, although it is thought to be consid
erable, as many of the valuable books
were damaged by water.

garding the jurisdiction of tho United
States executive authority over the'for

law would uphold the entire jurisdiction
of the Federal executives over the forest
reserves, just as that of any private
owner; second, that even if this were not
the case, it could not be questioned that
the United States had entire authority
over its public lands; third, that the right
enjoyed by grazers to run their stock on
the public domain is derived from the
sufferance of the national Government
and not from any authorization of Con-

To-night the visitors were tendered a
ball, there being more than ninety couples
in the grand march.
The candidates for sub chief ranger are
George B. Goldman of San Diego and Sen
ator E. I. Wolfe of San Francisco. Wolfe
is the choice >f the Heenan faction and
the Heenanites are willing to make any
kind of a compromise to win for him.
Goldman's friends are in to stay, and ex
press confidence In his ability to carry off
the prize. Upon this fight appears to
hinge the subsequent contests, and. the
side which wins' the sub chief rangership
will have a fair chance of sweeping the
boards, including grand representatives.
. O'Brien and Foppman are running
about even for grand recording secretary,
while Grim of Stockton appears to be
leading Henry A. Gabriel of Santa Clara
for grand senior woodward. For grand
junior woodward E. B. Collins is decidedly
a favorite over Foley of Los Angeles.
Grand Secretary Cordy and Grand Treas
urer Conklin have no opposition.
Goldman vs. Wolfe.
The parade of Foresters took place this
afternoon, there being about 500 In line.
Immediately after the parade exercises
were held in the City Park. Judge E. B.
Collins delivered the address of welcome
and was followed by Mayor Clark. The
Mayor presented the key of the city to
Grand Chief Ranger Hugo K. Asher, who
replied in an eloquent speech. This con
cluded the literary exercises and the
delegates immediately congregated in
small groups to talk over to-morrow's
fight for grand officers.
The contest which 'will 'open to-morrow
afternoon promises to be one of the. most
stubborn in the history of the order.
There are in the fielo two tickets, which
are designated as those of the Heenan
and the anti-Heenan factions. While John
Heenan is certain to be the next grand
chief ranger, the fight for sub chief
ranger is a warm one. and politics is be
ing done in earnest.
Resolutions of respect to the memory
of the late Past Supreme Chief Ranger
Lewis Thorne were read and adopted and
the Grand Court adjourned at 12 o'clock
out of respect to his memory.
The report of Grand Secretary Cordy
gives the statistics of the order for the
year. His figures as to membership are
the same as those of the grand chief
ranger. The receipts for the year were
$222,205. The expenditures were: For med
ical attendance and medicine, $43,783; for
sick benefits, 561,075; general benefits,
$9682; donations, $2965; management ex
penses, $71,890; for social purposes, $3397;
sick benefits advanced to other courts,
52S39; total. $200,832. That leaves a bal
ance of $21,273, which, added to the
amount on hand January 1, 1900, makes a
total of $191,413. Since the organization
of the Grand Court in 1SS9 there has been
paid for relief to members in various
ways, $9S9,353. The grand secretary re

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, May l.-t 'I am
not a candidate for the Presidency," said
Senator Hanna laughingly, after he had
read the interview with the secretary of
the National Committee, Perry S; Heath,
printed lira special cablegram from Lon
don.
-Mr. Heath's interview did not seem to
displease the Senator from Ohio, - but he
declined to discuss it in any way, and
when pressed for a statement said:
> "If you want an interview you will
have to interview yourself. I won't talk
about it." - Â« â¢ .
Among Republican politicians. in "Wash
ington .. the Interview with Heath at
tracted much attention, especially when
it' is. recalled that a few weeks ago Sen
ator Scott, a member of the Republican
executive committee, suggested the nom
ination of Senator . Hanna 1^1904. \ The
two interviews taken together form the
basis of a belief that the National Com
mittee may enter upon a - campaign to
bring about' the nomination of Hanna.
There are many men in the Republican
party who believe that no better nomi
nation than that of the Ohio Senator
could be made, and it would not be sur
prising if he is put forward by the next
convention if the rheumatism from which'
he suffers at times does not â¢ interfere
with his Â¦ acceptance.
Advocates of his candidacy say that a
great change has taken place in the popu
lar estimation of Senator Hanna since
he entered the Senate. His straightfor
ward | methods of Â¦ advocating legislative
measures and his courage in defending
hi3 opinions - have made friends for him
and have won him the respect even of
those who differ with him. It is recalled
that when' during the last campaign Sen
ator Hanna proposed to take Â¦ the
stump in person many Republican politi
cians feared that ' it would be a serious
mistake, but he proved to be one of the
best speakers the party had and his pop
ularity was much increased in every com
munity in which he spoke. The fact that
he- is now being put> forward for nomi
nation by the leaders in the Republican
organization makes it apparent that he
must bg^ considered in any forcasts of
probabw action of the Republican â¢ Na
! tional Convention in 1904. i

Increase in an Already Prevail-

At no time In the history of disease has
there been such an alarming increase, in
the number of cases of any particular

Kidney trouble often becomes advanced
Into acute stages before the afflicted Is
aware of its presence; that is why we
read of so many sudden deaths of prom-
inent business and professional. men, phy-
sicians and others. They have neglected
to stop the leak in time.
"While scientists " are puzzling .their
brains to find out the cause, .each indi-
vidual can by a little precaution avoid tha
chances of contracting dreaded and dan-
gerous kidney trouble, or eradicate It com-
pletely from their system if already af-
flicted. Many precious lives might have
been and many more can yet be eaved by
paying attention to the kidneys.
It is the mission of The Call to benefit
Its readers at every opportunity, and
therefore we advise all who have any
symptoms of kidney or bladder trouble tc

most distressing kidney and bladder trou-
bles. With the sample bottle of Swamp-
Root will also te sent free a pamphlet and

PATBOLlEEN' AEE FINED BY
POLICE- COMMISSIONERS
The chief interest in the proceedings of
the Police Commission last night centered
in the trials of three officers for infringe
ments of the regulations.
Patrolman Hiram G. Smith was charged
by Sergeant Shaw with having neglected
his duty for a visit to friends in the
"Wharfinger's office, where he smoked a
pipe, contrary to police rules. The ac
cused pleaded "not guilty" and produced
witnesses who were present at the time
in question, who testified that they did
not see Smith smoking. Sergeant Shaw
swore that he personally saw Smith
smoking, and as his evidence was positive
the Commissioners rendered a verdict of
"guilty." In view of Smith's long and
efficient service, however, the penalty im
posed way only $10. t
Patrolman Patrick Foley was charged
with neglect of duty in being absent from
his beat. Sergeant Wolf testified that he
had spent an hour on the night of April
28 in a vain search for the accused officer
and finally found him coming from a
building. Foley was fined 520 and repri
manded.
Patrolman Patrick Butler was repri
manded for reporting for duty twenty
minutes late. *â¢_ Â»
A number of Chinese liquor dealers ap
peared before the commission in answer
to charges of selling intoxicants to China
town vagrants. They were all placed on
probation.
Several Presidio saloon-keepers applied
for renewals of licenses, but owing to a
flaw In the method of summoning them,
their cases were generally continued. The
Commissioners expressed their dissatis
faction at the closing of army canteens.
They decided to refuse applications for
renewals in the Presidio district as soon
as the old licenses expired.

CAKTiraBY DEAL , IS
NEAKING COMPLETION
Syndicate Has Not Yet Accepted Price
Asked by Alaska Packers'
Association.
The syndicate involving the principal
salmon canneries on the Pacific Coast is
liearing completion. All of the salmon
packing houses on the coast have named
their prices and these prices have met
with the approval of the syndicate, with
the exception of the Alaska Packers' As
sociation. It is said that the latter's cap
ital stock represents $4,500,000 and that the
shareholders will not sell under $9,000,000.
President Henry F. Fortmann of the Al
aska Packers' Association is at present
in the north inspecting the canneries, but
a prominent officer of the company said
yesterday that the .association had not
yet sold to the syndicate. He admitted
however that he had given R. Onffroy, the
organizer of the syndicate, an option on
the stock. "
George B. Meyers, one of the. owners of
the Meyers. Packing Company of Seattle,
is in this city. His cannery is one of the
oldest established on the coast. He said
yesterday that he had been asked by the
syndicate to give a price for his canning
business and had done so. He added that
all of the canneries have till June 30 to
consider the matter. He would not state
what price he asked, for his concern.
J. Pierpont Morgan and other financiers
are said to be back of Onffroy and will
put up the necessary capital to complete
the deal, should the owners; of the can
neries offer their establishments at rea
sonable figures. â¢ ' 1 .

. 'in full force. this afternoon and even
ing to witness the opening of the
'club's annual exhibition: Never before in
th:e history of San Francisco dogdom. has..'
society taken such an interest in the
bench show, not only because the canine
pets of many social favorites are entered,
but the bluest tlooded stock of the Eastf
em kennels and shows is here for ribbon
prizes.
Terriers have the call just now as house
pets and these classes will be the strong
est ever exhibited in the West. "In the
smooth coated fox terriers champion Nor
folk Victorius, a dog bred' in Canada, but
Â¦now owned in Texas, is considered the
best of the Eastern stock, -while among
the wire haired fox terriers the great
champion Meersbrook Bristles* will be on
the bench. In Boston terriers, as well as
in Alrdales, Scotch, bulls and others, the
classes will be far above average. Nor
will keen competition be lacking, for 'of
late years California fanciers have been
reaching out for the best stock that
money -can buy and many champions of
Eastern and English shows are now
owned in this State and will be exhibited.
Sporting dog owners and breeders will
have a chance to- see a large number of
Eastern show setters and pointers, as L.
A. Klein and Ben Lewis, the well known
handlers,* are here with' big strings se
lected from among the winners at the.
Chicago show, recently closed. In collies
and St. Bernards some surprises are
promised as local fanciers have recently
purchased some cracks -and will try to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas. May 7.â The en
tire eastern section of Texas was devas
tated by a storm of wind and hail, caus
ing great havoc to property and crop3.
The blow was terrific, and houses of the
strongest character In Its path were de
molished like paper â¢ boxes and trees
twisted off like so many weeds, while
hailstones ranging Â¦ in size from marbles
to a man's fist beat the crops out of
existence and broke all the window
panes. The fury pf the storm was spent
in the same section that last year at thi3
time was devastated by wind and water,
when State aid was necessary to prevent
starvation. The same thing is expected
in this Instance.
Farmers had just planted crops, . and
all were up a few inches above ' the
ground. Replanting is necessary, and as
the season is almost too late, it is feared
the population will have to be cared for
by the charitably. Inclined of the State,
who were overtaxed by the drain of re
sources for the recent Galveston disaster.
The extent of the storm was hardly as
great as that of last year, however, fewer
counties being visited. . Eastfalls and
West Limestone counties suffered the
heaviest in the number Injured.
' . ' Church.es Are Demolished. . -
At Calihan the Baptist church wa3
blown down while people were at service,
and J. C. Owens, a negro who had taken
refuge there, was killed, and a dozen of
the congregation- were injured. Other
buildings were wrecked. . Tho hail was
very severe, breaking in the roofs of
many dwellings. â¢

EASTERN TEXAS
Fired Accidentally.
CAMBRIDGE. Mass., May 7.â The cli
max in the Eastman murder trial was
reached to-day when the defendant him
self took the etand to tell his own story.
He went into no elaborate details, and
answered onry the questions put to him
by His lawyer. For two hours he was
on the stand giving his testimony as to
his relations with Grogan and the Inci
dents on the day of the shootinsr. He
declared that the shooting was an acci
dent and that up to last October he had
alwaj-s believed that it was the old-rim
f:re pistol that discharged the bullet
which killed his brother-in-law.
The struggle which followed, he said,
v.as for the possession of the center-fire
pistol which Grogan had in his hand.
Kastman said that he went to Grogan
first to assist him and then, because of
the expression on his face, to get the
weapon away from him. He said that
there was bo much noise and confusion
In the struggle that he could not recall
how many times Grogan's revolver went
off. But that It did go off he was almost
certain. He did not know how he re
ceived his own wound and said he did
everything possible after "the affair to
assist Grogan to the house, and was
prostrated with grief when he found that
he was dying.
The cross-examination was not finished
when the court adjourned for the day.

Sharkey Loses on a Foul.
DENVER, May 7.â A special to the Re
publican from Cripple Creek says:
"Mexican Pete" Everett to-night got a
decision over Tom Sharkey on a foul In
the second round of what was to have
been a twenty-round go before the Olym

take affair, Everett making fully as good
a shewing as the sailor. In the second a
few seconds after the round was called
the two men came together in a mixup.
Everett received a body blow which sent
him to his knees. While he was down
Sharkey struck him on the head and the
rtferee gave the fight to Everett. After
the decision Sha,rkey offered to fight
Everett at once for $1000 a side and Ever
ett accepted the challenge, but friends of
botb men interfered.

California, acting In conjunction with the
California Water and Forest Association.
There was an intention to expend much
more this year had the Governor signed
the bill to insure the co-operation of the
State in the work." â¢
The Water and Forest Association has
adopted an address to be sent out by the
executive committee to each of the sev
eral thousands of members of the associa
tion. This will deal in a mild way with
the failure of the Governor to sign the
bill after it had been passed with prac
tical unanimity by both branches of the
State Legislature. The members will bo
advised to maintain the orgayization,
with the hope that the next attempt to
have the work prosecuted by the State
may be successful.
llr. Newell is on a tour of Inspection of
the work that was done last year by the
Government Geological Survey in this
State, that he may be personally familiar
vdth it all. He will visit the Salinas Val
ley first, and will in turn see the other
districts where the preliminary explora
tions have been made. He says that in
vestigations have determined that 1.000,000
acres in California that are now arid can
be irrigated. Enormous power can also
be developed from storage reservoirs. The
Government Is studying how to settle up
the Government lands. Water will settle
the question. He expects immense devel

if the work that has been begun can be
pushed.

F. H. NEWELL, HYDROGRAPHER
OF THE UNITED STATES GEO
LOGICAL, SURVEY.
NEW YORK, May 7.â Conciliation as a
means of maintaining Industrial peace be
tween labor and capital was discussed by
leaders of unionism and finance at the
Chamber of Commerce this afternoon.
Tho meeting was arranged by the indus
trial department of the National Civic
Federation and all of the contributors to
the symposium were leaders in their sev
eral fields of activity. They met Tipon
common ground and were a unit in the
hope that strife would be eliminated from
the relations of employer and toiler and
a perpetual truce declared.
The speakers were Samuel Gompers,
president cf the American Federation of
Labor; Bishop Potter, John B. Mitchell,
president of tho United Mine Workers of
America; Charles B. Flint, president of
the American Rubber Company; Daniel J.
Keene, of the Illinois Board of Arbitra
tion; William H. Hayward of the National
Association of Builders; James O'Con
nell, president of the International Asso
ciation of Machinists, and Herman Justi.
commander of the Illinois Coal Operators
Association.
Samuel Gompers presided and In open
ing the meeting expressed the hope that
a new epoch had come in the relations of
labor and capital. "We want Industrial
peace, but notTat the sacrifice of any of
the elements of manhood," he said. "The
increased growth in the organization of
labor has brought greater responsibility.
The work Is going ahead actively, how
ever, and we are meeting our problems in
a practical way. We are dealing with liv
ing men and living women and living
children in the hope of better things for
all. The laboring people insist that they
be regarded as something more than wage
earners. They are men with rights and
hopes and aspirations and lpve."
John Mitchell said that he was for
peace because he had known the bruises
of war. "The relations of labor and cap
ital," he said, "are purely a business
proposition. There is no sentiment in it.
Peace is better for both, and I am for
peace if we can have an honorable peace.
I believe there never would be strikes If
the employers and employes could meet
in fair conference. If we could have got
a hearing last 'year the great coal strike
would have been avoided."
Charle3 R. Flint, the . capitalist, was
humorously introduced as the walking
delegate of the American Rubber Com
pany, who worked fourteen hours a day.
He expressed his confidence in the good
that would come of closer relationship be
tween labor and capital. He exhaustively
reviewed the export trade of the country
and the accomplishments of the skilled
American laborer, and said that in this,
the greatest industrial evolution the
world had ever known, there was no room
for strife between American labor and
American capital.
BATLBOAD EMPLOYES STRIKE.
Samuel Gompers, in closing, said that
the thorough organization of labor pres
aged complete protection for the honest
employer against his dishonest competi
tor who "nibbled" at prices..
Company's Refusal to Grant Nine-
Hour Day Causes Trouble.
SCRANTON, Pa.. May 7.â Another
strike of Delaware, Lackawanna and
Western Railroad employes was precipi
tated here at noon to-day by the refusal
to grant the request of the workmen for
a nine-hour working day at the present
rate of wages. A grievance committee of
twelve men, representing' the" macMnlsts,'
waited upon Superintendent of Motive
Power Lloyd and reauested the conces
sion. He refused the demand, a report
was made by the committee and the men
decided to strike at once. All the men
struck, including machinists, blacksmiths,
boiler-makers and helpers, engine wipers
and laborers, to the number of 900.
Word of their action was sent to all
other men in similar occupations along
the line from Hoboken, N. J., to Buffalo.
These, with the shopmen who struck on
Saturday for the reinstatement of tho
man Hicks, discharged at. Dover, N. J.,
make nearly 2000 Lacltawanna men on,
strike at Scranton.
STREET RAUJtOAJJS TIED TJP.
Employes of a Company in Albany
Leave Their Cars.
ALBANY, N. Y., May 7.â The employes
of the United Traction Company, which
operates the street surface car lines in
Albany, Troy, Cohoes, Watervleit and
Rensselaer went on a strike at 4 o'clock
this morning. The car lines in the five
cities are completely tied up. The strike
was wholly unaxpected by the public.
The men want complete recognition of
the Amalgamated Association of Street
Railway Employes and the discharge of
seven non-union men employed by the
company. They also want extra men paid
the same rate per hour as regular men.
A modification of the duties of conductors
relative to registration of inspectors is al
so requested. The strikers, who number
about 1000, are orderly. All sorts of con
veyances are being used for transit pur
poses.
Carpenters Agree to Arbitrate.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 7.â The carpen
ters who quit work to-day because the
contractors would not 'â¢ agree to exclude
non-union labor were not followed In their
strike by all the other working men in
the building- trades, and to-night they ap
pointed a committee to meet tho contrac
tors and arbitrate their differences. It is
thought that this action of the carpenters
means an end of the strike.

An Illinois association opposed to woman suffrage
has issued a manifesto, roundly denouncing the efforts
of the fair sex to vote. It is evident that Mrs. Na

that community to suggest the propriety of her
going there to do something more than vote.
a jury"under fire.
C.ONSIDERABLE discussion has been occa
sioned in the East by what appears to have
been a serious miscarriage of justice in the
case of James Callahan, charged with complicity in the
kidnaping of young Cudahy. The accused man. was
promptly acquitted by the jury, whereupon the presid
ing Judge is reported to have said to the jurors: "It
is impossible for me to conceive how twelve men of
ordinary intelligence could have reached such a con
clusion after hearing the absolutely convincing argu
ments in this case. If Callahan had selected his own
representatives he could not have chosen more wisely
in his own behalf, and if the State, on the other hand,
had chosen, it could not have pointed out twelve men
who would'have been more blind to its interest. I do
not know what motives actuated you in reaching this
decision, but I hope none of you will ever again appear
in this jury-box. You are discharged without the
compliments of the court. The defendant is likewise
discharged, I presume to continue in his criminal
course, as you have failed to check him." /
As the evidence upon which the jury acted has not
been fully reported we have no way of determining
how far the severity of the Judge was justified. Our
Eastern contemporaries, however, almost with one
accord, unite with the Judge in condemning the ac
quittal. It'is said there is no evidence that the jury
was bribed or in any other way tampered with, but
the counsel for .Callahan made, a direct appeal to
prejudice against the rich, and succeeded in winning
the verdict of the jury in that way. One report says
the jurors "regarded it as a- fight between wealth and
poverty, and do not seem to have considered either
the extremely criminal character of the offense nor
the boy's deprivation of liberty and the possibility' of
his being murdered had not his father paid down the
ransom."
The case is a peculiar one and, should be investi
gated. It is hard to believe an American jury would
deliberately acquit a criminal solely, because his of
fense had been committed against a rich man; and
yet it is equally hard to believe a Judge would from
the bench make so severe an accusation against a jury
without some foundation. The issue is one of high im
portance. It would be an ominous sign indeed if in
our courts there should grow up distrust and antag
oni&m between Judges and juries. Class prejudices in
the jury-box would be as â¢dangerous to public welfare
as would corruption on the bench, and anything that
tends -fo raise a grave suspicion of a miscarriage of
justice brought about'-by such prejudices ought to
have. the earnest attention of; the public, to the end
that the evil may be checked at the start.
SPECULATION IN NEW YORK.
REPORTS from New York .are to the effect
that never before haS the city beem so crowded
with strangers for any considerable length of
time. The crowds are not like the swarms that came in
to attend the Dewey reception, or that have thronged
in the city on other festal occasions, for those re
mained hardly more than a day, while the present
crowd has been about the hotels- and the streets for
weeks and promises to remain until well into the sum
mer. It has gathered not to make a holiday, but to
get rich. It has been drawn from all parts of the
country by reports of speculative activity in Wall
street, and is made up almost wholly, of speculators.
One report says: "The extravagance of the time
has never been equaled. * * * . The idea seems to
be that . everything will rise in value and keep on
rising; that there is no top notch, and no chance of
falling. It is said that the old hands at the game have
begun to be afraid and are standing aside, but they
are not missed. Everybody who can raise a margin is
buying, and as so many are gathering in profits there
is no dearth of spenders. The hotels, the restaurants,
the theaters, the shops, are crowded with, throngs who
demand the best and pay for it. No holiday' season
has equaled the lavishness of spending on the part
of those who have grown able so suddenly and easily.
There is a daily carnival of self-indulgence." ' Â¦ . â¢>
On a single day last week over 3,300,000 shares of
stock Were bought and recorded. It is but a short
time ago when that would have been deemed a good
business for a whole week. Great as the record is,
however, it does not tell the whole story. It is esti
mated by experts that in addition to the transactions
recorded there were on that same day sold upward of
500,000 shares that were not reported. Nor does even
that complete the tale, for over and above all stock
transactions among men there' was considerable ac
tivity among the brokers who deal with women specu
lators. " ' '
The lady patrons of the exchange are by no means
few, nor are their purchases on slight value. A rep
resentative of the New York Sun who visited a "pri
vate office" where women assemble to speculate
found seventy-five of them there at one time. The
visit was made on the invitation of a member of the
firm occupying the office, who had said: "You go
down to the Stock Exchange and you think that there
is a good deal of activity. A stranger might be par
doned for thinking that hell had broken loose. If
you'll come up into my office for a short time and
take in what is going on you may be pardoned for
concluding that' a considerable number of the Furies
have gone on' a picnic.",
While the reporter was looking around and noting
the eagerness of the women the broker said: "Most
of these women are putting on more airs in the
way of dress now than they did four months ago.
As you see, most of. them are regular peacocks.
Four months ago most of them were of the wren
variety. The milliners and the dressmakers and the
shoemakers and the glove shops must- be doing a
rushing business on Wall street profits. And, I would
have you to know, most of our customers are now al
together above such a trivial thing as carfare. They
hire hansoms and broughams and automobiles now.
That woman over there (the particular woman was
designated) didn't seem to be particularly affluent
when she was introduced here shortly after the first
of January. Maybe she had money to burn, but she
didn't look like it. Now she has a brougham and a
pair of horses and two men on the box, and she runs
to rubies and. pearls that would give a lapidary fits
and starts." .
It is not American dressmakers and jewelers only
who are profiting by the outbreak of extravagance.
The. Sultan of Turkey seems to think that because
he has bought a warship from an American firm he
neet 1 not pay for the Armenian outrages. He may
find to his cost that it is not the ship but the men "on
it who make Uncle Sam dangerous when he goes
a-gunning.
INDIAN RANGE LANDS.
THE Indian Rights Society is a self-sacrfficing
organization, maintained for the purpose of se
curing the rights which belong to the tribes
and fragments of tribes which were once owners of
the soil on which they live now by sufferance.
One of the most grievous wrongs to which the In
dians were found to be subjected was the encroach
ment upon the grazing lands of their reservations by
white stock-owners. First crowding out the Indians
the whites crowded each other in a scramble for use
of the forage that grew on the range. Then the
sheep c^me along, crowded out cattle and horses, and
proceeded to destroy the range entirely, repeating
within the Indian reservations the harm they had al
ready done on the public domain outside.
When attention .was called to this state of things
the Interior Department adopted the policy of leasing
the Indian land to stock men, making them pay for
its use. Immediately the *situation changed, the lands
were eagerly leased, their forage protected, and now
they are restored to their priniitive condition of fer
tility. The large revenue derived is placed to the
credit of the tribes owning the land, and between the
reservation pastures and the fed-out ranges on the
public domain appears the contrast between the desert
Â£nd the sown. The reservations are like oases in the
blear waste that common use of the public range has
created around them. This object lesson makes one
wish that there might be organized a "white man's
rights society," to protect the property of all the
people in the stock ranges on the public domain. A
revenue of $10,000,000 a year is being lost by the use
of those ranges as commons, and their potential
wealth is being permanently destroyed by the extir
pation of their grasses.
When President McKinley made his first address in
New Mexico, on Monday, he found statehood de
manded on every banner that fluttered in front and
overhead. Speaking pleasantly to the people, he said
that statehood would come when favored by the will
of Congress, and meantime, said he, "You need more
people and more rain."
A voice from the crowd answered, "We want to be
connected with you so as to get more rain.". This
meant that as a State, with two Senators and a voting
member of the House, New Mexico would add her
Congressional strength to -the movement to force ir
rigation appropriations into the river and harbor bill
and compel the Federal treasury to take up the bur
den of storing storm waters to make the arid West
fertile. Yet New. Mexico has within her borders as
public domain a public asset and property which,
leased as are the Indian lands, would give her more
money for irrigation than she can hope ever to get out
of the Federal treasury- Her increasing aridity is due
to the destruction of her stock ranges by their use
as free commons. An area in that territory which
once supported 150,000 head of cattle does not now
feed â¢ 1500. It is fed-out and gone back to desert.
Yet had it been under leasehold control its grasses
would be as good as ever and its stock carrying ca
pacity as great.
The Federal treasury is now carrying about as
many enterprises as the majority of the taxpayers feel
like paying for. . We are certain that the East is not
averse to Western development, but when New Mex
ico tells the President she "wants in" the Union in
order to fertilize her lands at the expense o^ the
treasury, the taxpaying millions of farmers east of
the Mississippi will no doubt reflect that they are in
the Union, and it is not fertilizing, fencing, plowing
nor 6eeding their lands for them. They are joint
owners of the public domain, just as the Indians, are
joint owners of the reservations which the Govern
ment is so beneficially leasing. Their property in that
domain has been used "for years without rent or any
compensation, and now, in addition to this free use
and waste of their property, they are. asked- to pay
taxes to water and fertilize the farms of others lying
in the same region.
Will it not be perfectly reasonable for them to re
fuse this double sacrifice, and will it not be wise for
the West to consent to the leasing of the ranges and
devotion of the proceeds to irrigation? If this is not
done the issue will soon be acute in Congress, and
every new arid State admitted increases the power to
overload the river and harbor bill and block all legis
lation until it is forced through, â¢

SECOND HOMESTEAD ENTRY-J. B.
M., Montague, Cal. The following circu
lar, issued by the General Land Office at
"Washington to the registrars and receiv
ers at United States land offices,. Is an
answer to' your question relative to sec
ond homestead entries:
Tour attention Is called to the provisions of
sections 2 and 3 of the act of Congress en
titled "An act for the relief of thÂ« Colorado
Co-operative Colony; to permit second home
steads in certain cases, and for other pur
poses," approved June 5, 1900 (Public No. 148).
a copy of which sections Is hereto attached.
Section 2 provides that any person who has
theretofore made homestead entry and com
muted the same under section 2301. Revised
Statutes, and the amendments thereto, shall
be entitled to the benefits of the homestead
law as though such former entry had not been
made, but commutation under section 2301.
Revised Statutes, shall not be allowed of an
entry made under this section.
Section 3 provides that any person who.
prior to the passage of this act, has made a
homestead entry, but for any cause has lost
or forfeited the same, shall be entitled to the
benefits of the homestead law as though such
former entry had not been made. Therefore,
you -will not hereafter reject a homestead ap
plication on the ground that Â«the applicant
cannot take the prescribed oath that hÂ» has
not previously made such an entry, or be
cause he has perfected title under section 2301.
Revised Statutes, to land entered under the
homestead law; but he will be required to
show by afndavit designating the entry for
merly made by description of the land, num
ber and date of entry, ok other sufficient data,
to enable me to Identify the same on the rec
ords of this office, and that it was forfeited
or commuted, as the. caae may be. prior to the
passage of the act.
In any' case where the former entry was
made subsequent to the date of the act. ths
rule given on pare 13. Circular of July 11. 1889.
remains unchanged. It will be observed that
an entry made under section 2 cannot be per
fected by commutation under section 2301. Re
vised Statutes.
The fact that applicants have purchased, nn
der the provisions of the act of March 2, 1889
(25 Stat.. 981), lands patented to the Flathead
Indians in Montana, shall not be held to have
impaired or exhausted their homestead rights
by or on account, of any such purchase.

HAYWARDS AND THE PRESIDENT.
WHILE there is so much scrambling in the
eagerness of all classes of people to obtain
something of a visit from the President
during his tour of the State it is gratifying to find
one locality that asks nothing more than what mod
esty itself could approve. That locality is Haywards.
The Presidential train is to pass through the town on
the way to Stockton" and Sacramento, and the people
have contented themselves with asking no more than
that in passin'g the train shall move slowly, so that they,
â and particularly the school-children of the city â
may have a chance to see the President.
Such a request should be promptly granted. Hay
wards has not asked anything than can interfere with
the general arrangement of the tour, or delay the
arrival of the President at Stockton or Sacramento.
They have not undertaken to have the train stopped
at their town in order that they might introduce their
prominent citizens and have a speech. They have not
sought in any way to impose a new burden upon the
President, or to add a new complication to the pro
gramme of the day. Their request is moderate, rea
sonable and considerate to all concerned.
The plan proposed is simple. It is the design to
have the school-children drawn up in order near the
railroad track, where all can have a good. view of the
train, and it is desired that the President take his stand
upon the rear platform, where, as the train slowly
moves on its wayi the children mayjiave the chance
to see the President of the republic.
The railroad officials are said to have the request
under consideration. It- should not take them long
to determine upon a favorable response. To pass
Haywards at a slow rate would' not long delay the
train, and it could easilymake. up the lost time. It is
to be hoped the request can be granted and that the
school-children of Haywards may carry with them
among the recollections of their schooldays a memory
of the time they saw President McKinley.

"Aw rike," he grunted. But put forth
as his own view: "Me, I tlnk fifteen .bebes
in de' ouse Is plenty club."
"Ma doesn't think so," the little girl at
his side piped up in the American tongue.
"Oh, you bebe, what do" you know about
it?" said Basil, pulling her ear.
It really seemed that a woman who
maintained such an organization at home
might sometimes like a change of clubs.
"Don't you think the fact that our
mothers and grandmothers were not club :
members influences us more than any
other objections we can bring?" I sug
gested.
"But what good is to for talk, talk, talk,
be noiza!"
"Women are studying and discussing
authors," I quoted from my friend's let
ter. "They are seeking expression them
selves. If your wife had Joined the club
you would no doubt notice changes in her
manner of talking." The lltie girl
laughed again and Basil shrugged.
"Ma woman, he talk plenty," said Basil.
My Imagination began to picture his
mate an overburdened drudge, whom he
probably worked in the field as well as in
the house. However, if she held to the
traditions of her grandmothers she would
enjoy life and make her cares light and to
this tho bright-eyed little girl seemed to
testify.-
Men are. sometimes unreasonably per
sistent. For instance, a man will per
sist In carrying your umbrella for you and
he is sure to dribble the rain on your hat
while he protects the back of his own
collar, or to lay the umbrella down and
lose it. The Illinois habitant showed a
stubborn prejudice against the club spirit
of the age, though all the reasons he
could marshal were the expense of organs
zation and his own conviction that a
woman ought to abide in the house. â¢
The Little Girl Gives Information.
Evidently there was nothing more to
say and I had Basil's views. I learned just
what I expected to learn. The little girl,
who kept her arm around her father and
seemed amused by him, had something to
Impart before the conference ended.
'â¢Ma's been invited to the Woman's Club
all winter and she's gone every time and
says she's going to join."
"Ba jeemanyi" exclaimed Basil, startled
out of his politeness. He toed Inward,
like an Indian.
"Now, you know you won't do any
thing,", said the little girl. "If ma wants
to go to the club you'll let her go to the
club. You always let us have our own
way in the family."
Basil grinned and .though I had told him
I was disappointed by his position it real
ly hurt me to see him back down. For'I
am a conservative myself, and secretly
agreed with him that the habits of cen
turies should not be disturbed, and marry
mans are not the same as no gal mans.
He had the grace of not being too seri
ous about anything, and observed: "Dls
gone be fun. I find dat h'out!"
"She said you didn't care." pursued the
little girl. "And you don't care. You just
pretend you do."
"Go on you 'ouse, bebe." said Basil.
"De mos'. for what I been 'fraid is you
git too noiza."
"Come with roe. then." begged the child.
"I see 1 gone change my mind," " he
laughed. "If ma woman go. on club h'evry
week, dat's be aw rike yestida."
When this Illinois habitant touched his
cap and swung off along the street with
1 his outspoken offspring I went my own
way, forecasting what the woman's club
â¢was going to do In his family. Â¦
Clubs, Women and Literature.
If women- need outlets from their own
homes â and I am told there is a great cry
for such outletsâ they -will rush into clubs,
and club life Is revolutionizing the ways
of the last century. Perhaps it is selfish
to love one's own accustomed haunts and
books, to the exclusion of the world. I
feel wicked when certain library shelves
attract me too strongly and clean-cut
French becomes preferable to conversa
tion. Women who have not been brought
up on books miss the calmest Joy of life.
Yet there are many who cannot bear their
own company and seek fervently to herd
. Basil Monceau's wife, trained at the
side of my friend, the country aristocrat,
would come out at the end of a club sea
son a different and progressive habltante.
On her part she could help an aristocrat
with very solid qualities. The only danger
in all this exchange is that we may merge
ourselves into a general conglomerate so
that each woman will not be distin
guished as herself, but as a "club wo
man." . - ,
Though everybody is writing ephemeral
books, the study of literature is becoming
savingly common. Distinctions between
.literature and non-literature are occupy
ing many who think they know. But if
I were submitting a book to the ultimate
test, that test would be such an humble
unspoiled reader as the Illinois habitant
or his wife. Fine writing rolls oft his im
pervious^hide as dew rolls off his pumrÂ£
kins. Only f the truth about humanity
penetrates him. The Illinois habitant
would know a fine action when he Â«nw

XU.âTHE ILLINOIS HABITANT AND THE WOMAN'S CLUB.
When you want historical facts it Is
best to go after them yourself and get
them rirst hand: for there are so many
liars that darken knowledge with false
traditions. In like manner, when contem
porary matters interest you, such as the
influence and tendencies of clubs, it is
wise to take direct testimony from un
biased witnesses. And the man who can
have the least bias toward federations of
women is the Illinois habitant.
His fathers came years ago from Que
bec province, out of which th'ey brought
no nonsense. The progress of his adopted
State makes his head swim, but does not
move him any faster on that account. He
la the most conservative of her. citizens.
I had heard of him and even seen him.
As we encountered on the street ofâ let
us sayâ Ste. Adelaide, I knew I was going
to get unadulterated masculine opinion of
a prevailing modern tendency.-
His name was Basil Monseau. He looked
as if he enjoyed life. And why shouldn't
he?â living always well within his means,
having few wants, and a good farm of
his own. The priest looked after his soul,
and his wife looked after his house and
family. Our conversation began with
some surprise on his pant, though he
warmed to the subject; feeling the superi
ority of the male creature, but being truly
polite and not forcing- that superiority
into prominence.
It was not polite' to say, "X am seeking
unbiased opinions of women's clubs and
their bearing on the intellectual life of
women." Basil Monceau would have
shied polJteiy and escaped down a Ste.
Adelaide alley, with all his unbiased opln
â¢ions. He Is a much more reticent individ
ual than one of the aristocrats of a small
town. Nowhere else on earth are there
such aristocrats as the social leaders of
small towns. This one had successfully
founded a woman's club, and I her testi
mony in the shape of a letter I held in my
hand at the moment of encountering the
Illinois habitant. .'. \'
Need of a Women's Club.
She wrote; "I realized that there were
so many good women around me, growing
discouraged in lives of constant self-de
nial. They never expected to know much
of art and literature; they never expected
to travel; they were beginning to feel that
cruelest shame of falling behind their
children in mental attainments. It is a
weak plea when we are obliged to explain
to our children, 'I .had not your advan
tages when I was young.' It betrays the
slave of circumstance. To save our lives
we cannot admire tbe righteous slave of
circumstance as much as we admire the
prevailing rebel who carries all before
him. . \
"The past of these women was a vista Of
hardship. They had not enjoyed that best
of early nurture, the liberty of browsing
through old .libraries. The club opened
opportunities.
"Now, the basis of any club is frater
nity. Indeed., the fraternity of churches
affects the race as powerfully as the reli
gion they teach; Â¦
"Band women together in a club, and
social differences, money differences, cul
ture differences, vanish. Each woman is
valued at her true worth and spurred to
increase it. ' She learns her dignity as an
individual. ShÂ« learna to differ, and even
to argue, without starting a neighborhood
feud. -She learns tolerance: and, if the
club Is what it should be, rises even above
backbiting.
"When we began tho school-girlish oc
cupation of writing papers terrified us.
We took to encyclopedias as refugees
from Noah's flood took to the mountains,
until we got courage to broaden research
and venture on independent thinking.
Why Women Fear Everything.
"The hardest lesson for any human be
ing to learn is not to fear. A mother
ought to teach her child daily, 'Fear noth
ing.' Women are bundles of fear. They
fear poverty, and they fear the responsi
bilities of wealth. They are afraid to get
married, and afraid to be old maids. Bur
glars, lightning, mice, the ballot, scandal,
new ventures, old age, other womenâ they
fear everything! Their commonest ex
pression Is: *I am afraid.' I know all
about it. I am a woman myself.
"Fear is really a savage instinct, born
of Isolation. Draw a woman out of her
isolation and Bhe is not afraid. I do not
believe women's clubs are bringing us to
intenser life. The discouraged ones are
getting hold of the fact that all which is
called success began with 'I can' and 'I
will.' '
â¢â¢As to the club movement dying out,
that's nonsense. It Is widening- and throw-
Ing off restrictions; It Is Individualizing;
it Is bringing to a knowledge of the
world's work those who never before
dreamed of * getting out of deadening
routine.
"All Americans read something. Our
members had chaotic imDressions of
books, but few of them knew Goldsmith
from Mark Twain. The thought of study
was formidable. "My school days are
over,' they sighed one after another; be
ginning to perceive that our school days
are never over, I suppose you would be
astonished to hear that we were at first
ashamed of studying.' Nobody Is so un
willing to confess ignorance as the very
ignorant. It turned us dizzy to survey
courses of reading. The study of â¢ an
author seemed a tremendous undertaking.
Growth of Courage in the Club.
"But we are growing bold enough to ex
press criticism of our own. From our own
point of view we argue with or against an
author. He has to appeal to each of us
personally. There is no unanimous audi
ence in our club.
"Now, the queerest , thing of all is that
the women who come out most brilliantly
are the women who once seemed to have
nothing in them! They are a series of
surprises. You find them executive, dig
nified, ready, eager for expression, apt as
students, whereas before the fraternity
spirit set them free they appeared dull
and' cold.
"Perhaps -you'd better consult an out
sider if you want an unbiased ODlnion oa
clubs. You see.- 1 am enthusiastic." -
It was for the purpose of consulting an
outsider that I Â¦ approached the gentle,
conservative habitant, as described, and
we tried to come to an understanding; he
to learn what I was driving at and I to
surprise his views.
The Views of the Habitant.
A shrewd looking little girl stood be
side him, sliding her hand in and out. of
his pocket. He fondled her head against
his side; showing that they were on good
terms as father and child. We met on
the sidewalk of the Ste. Adelaide, and I
said: â¢
"You have a pretty town." It is always
a safe thing to say, and is often true.
"Oh, yes, . good ville." he answered' in
the patois of the Illinois habitant. "Far
maire got plenty h'oats, plenty conn."
"This is your little girl?"
"Ma fille, ma fcebes," he declared with a
wide smile, "is do mos' smartes' bebes in
dB' ville." Â¦ -
"Have you a large family?" I asked, like
on industrious census taker. .
"H'only fifteen. I git me plenty." V
"They must keep your wife very busy."
A queer smile crept around Basil Mon
ceau's mouth corners. ' â¢ : Â¦Â¦Â¦:Â¦Â¦'Â¦ Â¦â¢Â¦ ;
"I not gone Â¦ took devoce from- ma wo
man. â¢ Ma woman, he work good."
"And you're not idle yourself?" ....
"I give him ma money what I make It
de plenty. He not go on top de drug sto'
hevery, week, for talk,, be noiza, in de
club." Â¦"'Â¦* " . 'Â¦ . 'Â¦Â¦-Â¦'. ."..-. , '
Now we were coming to the point.
"Is there a woman's club In Ste. Ade
laide?" ..:.^:
, "Oh, yes.''. â
' "A large one? . . 'Â¦-...
"I t'ink so. Oh, dat's great tarn for club
in dis town!"
"What do you think of it?"
"Me? ' I not know anyt'ing about it."
' "But you have your opinion." . Â¦ â¢Â¦
"I not know anyt'ing about it,'.' he,re
peated. ../.. . ,Â¦ â¢ . - " r.- Â¦>Â¦'â¢Â¦Â» _
Doubtful Regarding Women's Clubs.
"I have been told that.' club work is ex
cellent for women. It broadens themâ
Raphael Welll, on his' home-coming
from nine months' sojourn In Paris, was
met at Sacramento yesterday by a beau
tiful bouquet of California flowers. The
blossoms excited the admiration- of the
ladies in the car. At Sixteenth street
station. Oakland. Mr. Weill was met by
a beautiful bunch of delegates from the
Bohemian Club and carried away to
dinner.
M. A! Chapelle of New York, accom
panied by his wife, arrived in the city
yesterday and is at the Palace. He is a
prominent officer of the Eagles and Is out
here to attend the Grand Aerie.
E. H. Fitzhugh, a prominent railroad
man from St. Loui3. returned from Del
Moute yesterday and is staying at the
Palace. He is. accompanied by his wife
and daughter.
E. R. Graham, a prominent Pittsburgh
oil expert, who is largely interested in
land at Bakersfleld. is at the Palace.
D. W. Crowder. who is connected with
tho Lee Mercantile Company of Kansas
City, is at the Palace.
Hon. TV. B. Gilbert. United States Cir
cuit Judge of Oregon, is at the Occidental.
P. P. Brown, a mining man of Holllster,
is at the Lick.
E..E. Bush, an oil man of Bakersfleld.
is at the Grand.
Millard Sanders of Pleaaanton is regis
tered at the Palace.
George E. Churd. a grain man of Fres
no,'is at the California, ;
PERSONAL MENTION.
Those of Europe 'also will reap a rich harvest. On
a:single day last week over 1400 persons sailed from
New York for various European ports. . A large
number of them, of course, are rich people who have
a custom of spending the summer in Europe, but
many of them were persons who have been fortunate
in their speculations/They have money to burn, and
Paris, London and Berlin will see the bonfires.
Another account of the crowding of the city says:
"The way-downtown hotels are crowded nights to
their utmost capacity, Not only are therernany peo
ple attracted to town by the. speculative excitement,
but the overworked brokers' clerks and bookkeepers
camp out downtown nights. In one of the largest
of the downtown hotels every room has been occu
pied for several nights backâ some of. the rooms hav
ing as many as three bedsâ while cots have been put
up and the parlors turned into dormitories.''
So the story goes. lit is a hot time in New York,
and there is money ip it for a while; but how long
will it last? * \
THE PRESIDENT'S DISCRETION.
AT El Paso and in New Mexico President Mc-
Kinley took pains to let his hearers know his
opinion of the nature and 1 structure of our
Government. Wherever there. was an indication of a
supplicatory condition, addressing the" President as the
Government, with dispensing power, he promptly cor
rected the tendency and let them know that while he
represents the Government he is not the Govern
ment. The Government is with the people, and its
three branches are their agents, and as executive he is
at the head of their triune agency.
It is remembered that President Johnson offended
the people by his daily reiteration of the phrase, "My
policy." The President can have no policy that
thwarts the people within the constitutional limita
tions, which are for him and them alike.
The President's great discretion and ' common
sense are noticeable in the natural. and proper man r
ner in which he refains from taking to himself the
enthusiastic ascriptions which are inspired by the
stimulus of his presence among the people. â¢
Going back to the first President we find the
progress of Washington from his home to the capital
and from the capital through the country was marked
by this same disposition to treat him as the Gov
ernment, and it was met by him in the same sensible
way that President McKinley pursues. In their en
thusiasm, and perhaps in their feeling of dependence,
the people desired to coin some form of titular address
for Washington, and actually discussed such titles as
"His High Mightiness," "Supreme Defender of the
Commonwealth," and others equally fantastic.
We have the survival of that in the common prac
tice of addressing the President as "His Excellency,"
a title used also in addressing Governors of States.
It does not belong to the President, and its use in
addressing him is highly improper. His title is just
as plain as the people he represents. It is "The
President," and nothing more.
The constitution of Massachusetts gives, the title
"His Excellency" to the Governor of that State. No
ether Governor in the United States is entitled to It.
When Governor Gage meets the Presidential party
at the State line the Governor of California will meet
and greet the President of the United States, and
neither one is "His Excellency."
Governor Gage very properly goes to meet the
President as an expression of the hospitality of the
people, and in offer of their greeting, and stands upon
no official punctilio about it.
In Washington's first administration Governor
Hancock of Massachusetts raised a great discussion
by refusing to meet the President and insisting that
Washington should come to him in the- capital.
When President Harrison visited this coast this same
issue was raised, very unpleasantly, by Governor
Pennoyer of Oregon. But there is nothing in it
The Governor is Governor of California, and his
official functions are all vital in him everywhere
within the State, and do" not cease when he leaves the
capital.

LEAVENWORTH, Kans., May 7.â The
town of Landing and the surrounding
country 13 in a state of intense excite
ment over an assault committed' upon
Miss Ether Bonnie, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. â¢ G. W. Bonnie, residents of that
town. The assault was committed 1 by an
unknown white man. who struck the girl
on the head with some blunt instrument,
rendering her unconscious.
At 30:30 o'clock this morning Miss Bon
nie left home for the bluffs along the Mis
souri River to gather mushrooms. While
stooping down she was suddenly seized
from behind, but managed to break away
from her assailant and started to run. He
overtook her and struck her. Believing
the girl to be dead, the man dragged her
body to a well near by and threw her in.
The well contained twelve feet of water
and Miss Bonnie sank to the bottom, but
rose agrain. The shock had the effect of
reviving her to such an. extent that she
realized her peril and made an effort to
climb out. After repeated failures she
reached the top, but was still in a dazed
condition and remained sitting- on the
ed^e of the well.
Mot arriving home for dinner, her
parents J became alarmed . and Â¦ beg-an.
searching Â¦ for her. and after some time
she was found, still sitting on the edge
of the well. She was then in a critical
condition, but was conveyed home and
mar-aped to tell the story of the assault.
The news soon spread throughout the
country and citizens began gathering and
started out to look for the assailant.
Word was also sent to the city, and the
Sheriff and several deputies started for
tho â¢Â¦ scene. Feeling Is so intense that
should the man be caught he will prob
ably be lynched.
Miss Bonnie is reported to have died as
the result of her injuries, but this Is not
yet confirmed.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
"It was my first visit to the Galapagos,"
j said H. Finley, mate of the W. S. Phelps,
Â¦ yesterday. "I never want to make an
! other one as long as I live. There are
I about thirteen islands in the group and
| all of them, save Chatham and Charles,
! are God forsaken. Albemarle Island was
| the scene of our operations. 'It is about
sixty miles long and fifteen miles broaa
and is really composed of six huge crat
ers, which are from 2000 to 4000 feet high.
"Our first landing was on a beach
formed of broken lava. As we sprang
from reck to rock innumerable crabs and
hideous iguanas started out in every di
rection and for a time J thought we were
in the midst of the inferno. Nearly all
the tortoises we found on the sides of
the mountains, where they go after cac
tus, on which they feed, and spme of their
shells are badly burned -where they must
have got into the lava. The biggest tor
toise in our cargo we found up near the
mouth of one of the craters and it took all
hands five days to get him down the side
of the mountain. We had to carry him In
a gliner and maybe we didn't curse his
weight as we staggered under it over the
broken lava. When we got him aboard
the ship we took a rest before starting on
another hunt.
"About Christmas time we went to
Chatham Islands for our mail. There is
a sugar plantation on the island and the
Government of Eucador sends its convicts
there to serve out their sentences. They
are Mormons on the island, but conditions
are different from what they are in Utah.
On Chatham Island every woman has
from four to ten husbands and she, makea
them work for her.
â¢"When v.e were not catching tortoises
we were seal hunting. The fur seal we
phot, but the hair seal we ; killed with
cHibs. Mr.* Green killed nearly all the
birds and helped us with the seals and
then when the tortoises grave out and
everything else got so wary that we
could not got a shot in a day we put up
sail and started for home. The tortoises
and turtles on the Galapagos will soon
be extinct, as the wild dogs and wild pigs
live on their eggs. We brought enough
cactus away with us to last the tortoises
throughout the voyage. During the last
few week3 they have been torpid, how
over, and have eaten nothing."
"We made a slow passage home," said
Mate Finley of the Phelps. "We prom
ised to call at Clipperton on our return.
When we got back there we found that
all the Japanese sent there to work the
phosphate beds had struck and gone to
the mainland. Two white men were on
the island, and they found it mighty lone
ly. They had an abundance of provisions
and gave us a quantity of flour. They
told us the Japanese had been taken to
the coast to get paid and as soon as they
got their money they cleared out and
positively refused to go back to the isl
and. We were sixty-four days all told
getting here from our hunting ground and
mighty glad I am that che run is over.
"Among our cargo is a quantity of shark
fins, and the procuring of those dainties
was the source of more fun than any
thing that happened during the year we
were rone. Sharks there were in thou
sands and there was never a time but
what two or three of the brutes were
abound the schooner. When we hooked
them they- fought like furies, but what
a satisfaction it was to kill them once we
got the brutes aboard.
# "The stuffed isuanas we have on the
vessel were caught in- the water; the live
ones we caught on the land. They look
exact iv alike, except that one is black and
the other yellow."
tortoises, 1460 hair sealskins, 203 fur seal
skins, a number of live and some stuffed
iguanas, a quantity of shark fins and a
large collection of blrdskins. About half
a dozen of the tortoises are the largest in
the world, one of them weighing 527
pounds. As to their age no one can guess,
but Captain Johnstone, owner of the
Phelps, asserts that all the big ones must
be more than 2000 years old.

PRETORIA. May 7.-Dutch refugees
who have arrived here from Pietersburg
pay the reason there have been so many
Boer surrenders recently is because Com
mar.der-in-Chief Botha wishes to get rid
of his weak fighters, who, instead of help
ing him, are an incumbrance. These refu
gees say Botha recently made an address
to the burghers, stating: he wished to re
tain only those who were willing to flgrht
to a finish. The fact remains, however,
the best of the Boer fighters steal away
and surrender whenever they see a
chance, as thej' are sick of undergoing
hardships without any object In view.

The contract for the cruiser St. Louis
was recently awarded to the Neafle &
Levy Ship and Engine Building Company
of Philadelphia. In order that there might
be no delay in the construction of the
ship. Admiral Bowles hastened the com
pletion of tracings of the St. Louis plans
and forwarded them to the firm throuch
the superintending, naval constructor. The
latter forwarded a communication ac
knowledging his receipt of the tracings.
The superintending constructor delivered
the plans to the company and, received a
receipt, which he also forwarded to the
department. â¢ â¢
The company now claims that.lt nevÂ«r
received the plans. When confronted with
its receipt, an explanation was given that
the letter acknowledging receipt of the
tracings was prepared in anticipation of
their delivery and that It had been inad
vertently signed and delivered to the su
perintending constructor.
The tracings of the. St. Louis r>lans are,
of course, valuable and would be espe
cially useful to a foreign government in
case It should obtain possession of them.
Admiral Bowles, cannot understand how
dhe tracings could disappear In such a
mysterious fashion, and in order to pro
tect- -the Interests of the government . ho
has formally recommended a thorough In
vestigation to be made. In the meantime
he has forwarded a set of blue prints to
the Neafle & Levy Company. As the trac
ings which have been lost are of no value
except to shipbuilders and to this rnd
other governments, the Inquiry, if made,
will be Important in fixing the responsi
bility for the loss and ! may indicate the
cause of their disappearance.*
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET N.
W., WASHINGTON, May 7.â There is a
mystery surrounding the disappearance of
the contract plans of the protected cruiser
St. Louis. Whether they have been lost
or stolen is a question which will prob
ably be determined by an official inquiry.
Rear Admiral Bowles, chief constructor,
is much' concerned about the matter and
has formally recommended the appoint
ment of a board to make an investigation.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
H. S. McCann, who was a member of
the crew of the Maine, has filed a claim
for $10,000 for injuries received in the ex
plosion, and Catherine Burns has filed a
claim. for $20 ,000 for the death of her son,
James Burns, who was a member of the
crew. In the petitions in these cases it
is set forth that the destruction of. the
Maine was not caused by any person or
persons in the. ship or in the employ of
the United States, or by any cause what
ever having its origin within the ship,
but by an exterior explosion, and that the
Government of Spain did not assure tho
safety and security of the battleship, a
vessel of the American navy in the har
bor of Havana, on a mission of peace and
rightfully there. The petitioners aver
that the explosion and destruction of the
Maine were directly caused by the wrong
doing and negligence of Spain and its
officers and agents, and that the Govern^
ment of Spain was and is responsible and
liable therefor. It is further set forth
that as a matter of law and fact It has
been determined by the Government of
the United States that the destruction ot
the Maine was caused by an exterior ex
plosion, and the Government of bpain
was, liable for the same.
The United States having. In the treaty
of Paris, assumed liability for the claims
of Americans against the Spanish Gov
ernment, and the Spanish Claims Com
mission having been created for the ad
judication of such claims, the claims ot
McCann and Mrs. Burns have been filed
with that commission, and the commission
must consider them at least 1 to the exÂ»
tent of deciding whether they come with
in its Jurisdiction. The United States be.
comes defendant in these cases, and It
will be- the duty of the Assistant Attor
ney General, who represents the Govern
ment before â¢ the claims commission, to
practically defend the - Spanish Govern
ment. It is probable that the commission
will avoid a decision that would charge
tho Spanish Government directly with the
destruction of the Maine, and If the de
cision Is made in favor of the petitioners
It will be on the broad ground that Spain
failed to Insure the safety of the ship
while in. the harbor of Havana.

# "WASHINGTON, May 7.^-On being ad
vised about three weeks ago through the
press dispatches from London of the ex
clusion of American beef from the Brit
ish army, the State Department instruct
ed Embassador Choate to inquire into the
matter. Information has been received
at the department which would indicate
that the notice issued by the army con
tract office of the British War Depart
ment on April 9 last excludes from, army
use for six months from June 1 next for
eign beef of every description, whether
imported dead or slaughtered in Great
Britain.
Dr. Wray, Inspector of American cattle,
appointed by the Department of Agricul
ture, who has investigated the subject, is
of the opinion that the order, when car
ried into effect, will not result in a great
or a considerable loss to American ex
porters of beef or cattle, for the reason
that the domestic supply of beef for all
purposes in Great Britain and Ireland is
bo limited that whatever beef by the new
ruling and notice may be shut out from
army use necessarily will be absorbed by
the general market. .There Is no over
supply now. The annual report of the
British Board of Agriculture for 1393
showed the total of home-bred cattle in
the United Kingdom as follows: Cattle,
United Kingdom, In milk, or in calf, cows
and heifers, 2,5(2,000; other cattle,, 4,078,000;
total, 6,640,000.- : .
Assuming the 4,078,000 to be all that are
properly available for slaughter, they
would furnish something less than one ox
Or bullock for each ten persons in the
population, if the population amounts to
40,000,000. Dr. Wray thinks It clear from
the statistics that for whatever beef the
army may draw on the local markets an
equivalent will have to be furnished from
abroad for the general market.
The quantity of beef Imported from the
United States and Canada (which is
equally affected by .the ruling and notice)
is very large and increasing every year,
and is brought .to Great Britain only to
supply the demand or the aggregate con
sumption, so that, according to the views
of Mr. Wray and many exporters whom,
he has consulted, there Is . no cause . to
apprehend any appreciable direct injury
to the American trade. . '
If these views are correct, â¢ the great
probability is that it will not be practic
able to enforce the new rule for even the
six months for which the' experiment is
proposed to be made, and that contract
ors, in order to fill their army . contracts
with the requisite quantity of beef of
good quality, will have to be permitted to
furnish some Imported meat. Dr. Wray
is equally emphatic In- expressing his
opinion ' that the operation | of the new
order is not likely to increase the exist
ing prejudice against imported American
beef and so work an indirect loss to our
exporters. He was informed at the army
contract office that - the reason for mak
ing the new order is not because of any
such prejudice either in the. War Office
authorities or among the officers and sol
diers of the army who are to be fed, but
solely due to the complaint of the British
farmers,- especially in the neighborhood
of the places where the army "authorities
purchase, and require delivery, that they
are shut out by the foreign article.

he was one of the founders of the Order
of Ea&les. To him Is due the credit of
founding the order of "Good Things,"

The San Francisco Aerie Is working
hard to provide "lots of fun" for the visit
ing birds and claims that Eagles from
afar will be too "tired to fly"' after the
sojourn In the city by the Golden Gate.
ALL the grand officers of the Order

Is a young one, it has spread
from one end of the country to the other,
and the officers are now traveling to this
city to meet In national session.
Dr. H. R. Llttlefleld. grand worthy

tary. Is the man upon whom, devolves
much work In connection with the Order
of Eagles. His home is in Seattle, Wash.,
and he is prominent in fraternal orders.
He was for many years secretary of the

be attributed the success of the Order of
Eagles. He was appointed to his present
post in November, 1899, and is sure of re
election. /
Del Cary Smith, grand worthy Judge ad

kane Wash., and Is president of the aerie

"Let Kings, Ministers and politicians
say what they may," said General Chaffee,
"but I can tell you this, that never will
you see Americans and Britishers facing
each other In the field. Our national pol

complications, but should circumstances
arise in which we must make a choice our
Inclination will be with the Britishers."
China, will request the powers to obtain
for her a loan sufficient to pay the In

made known. She will also ask for an

BERLIN, May 7. â Field Marshal von
Waldersee, in a dispatch from Peking,
dated yesterday, saye that Lieutenant
Kammer and a cavalry patrol attacked
and defeated the enemy's cavalry two
hundred kilometers west of Kalgan, In
Pechlll Province.
LONDON, May ".âThe rumors that the
relations between Germany and Russia
axe strained on account of slights on the
part of Count von Waldersee are dis
credited at the Foreign Office. Though it
is admitted in Downing street that the
majority of the powers are considerably
irritated by the field marshal's numerous
expeditions. It Is not believed that this
has led to any definite misunderstanding.
It may be authoritatively stated that if
the British diplomats had any reason to
believe the rumors of strained relations
between Germany and Russia It would
cause them no little satisfaction and they
would not take the trouble to discredit
them.

LONDON, May 8.â A Reuter dispatch
from St. Petersburg, dated May 6, says:
The agitation against the Government
continues, especially in literary and edu
cational circles, some of whose represent
atives are said to be agitating among the
laboring classes. Many arrests and dom
icilary visits have been made in this and
other cities, and the police are extraor
dinarily active. - The correspondence of
several foreign newspaper correspondents
and of members of the diplomatic body
has been secretly examined, many letters
never reaching their destinations.

RUSSIA IS FEAKITJL

The report has evidently made a good
Impression, and only a few radicals will
continue to oppose its acceptance. The
convention Will meet Thursday and is ex
pected to take definite action Saturday.
Regarding coaling stations the report
set forth that the places so desired by
the United States were Capes AIay3l and
San Antonio, and another point command
ing the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico.
These would be definitely determined
upon when drawing up the treaty.. The
object of these stations would be the
maintenance of the independence of Cuba
as well as the protection of the United
States. The report also said that the
United State's would in no way interfere
with the local government, and that Pres
ident McKinley. had promised to appoint
a commission, to meet a Culban commis
sion to discuss the economic question and
to draw up a commercial treaty as soon
as the republic is established, and that
he advises the Cubans In the meantime to
study the situation in this reppect. The
report announces^ that Secretary Root
had said that there was nothing In the
Platt amendment to prevent Cuba having
diplomatic representatives in foreign
countries.
In reference to the third clause of' the
Platt amendment the report stated that
the United States would not intervene un
less Cuba was attacked by a foreign
power and there existed In Cuba a con
dition of affairs similar to that which ex
isted under Spain at the time of American
intervention.
HAVANA, May 7.-The special commis
sion r-f the Cuban constitutional conven
tion, which returned here from Washing
ton May 5, made a report during a secret
session of the convention this afternoon.
The commission presented an extensive
account of their conference with Presi
dent McKinley and Secretary Root and of
the banquets and receptions, tendered
them. Senor Glberga objected to incor
porating an account of the social pro
gramme in the report, but the commis
sion insisted upon this point.

Diseases and
Weakness of

By for the greater number of patients seek-
ing relief for so-called weakness ore etrong
robust men in every other respect. Our theory
that Impotency, Prematureness, etc., are not
weaknesses, but the symptoms of inflammatory
'processes in the Prostate Gland (so called neck
of bladder) caused by contracted disorders and
early dissipation, la row being adopted by-the
leading specialists of the- world, and that bug-
bear, "Weakness of Men,". Is removed from tha
list of incurable disorders. Even the layman
can understand that tonics cannot cure inflam-
mation, and these canes, under their adminis-
tration, go from bad Â¦ to worse. Under our

ducing the enlarged and. swollen Prostate, im-
mediate results, as indicated by. increased cir-

der Case.
Woman's Attorney Seeks in
Vain to Have Prelimi
Â¦ : . nary Held.
"Isn't it funny," said Ferral as he left
the court room, "that I have to go and
beg Judges to hear a case of murder?
Don't you think it should be the other
way?"
The hearing was assigned to Judge Con
lan's court two weeks ago, but was con
tinued from, time to time, as Attorney
Ferral was engaged In the Superior
Courts. Ferral saw Judge Conlan Monday
morning and told him he was ready to
proceed, but as the Judge was leaving for
his vacation he said he would, assign it to
Jud?e Fritz's court.
Yesterday Ferral wa3 present in Judsje
Fritz's court with the defendant and tha
witnesses, but â¢ the Judge said the case
was not on his calendar and he could not
take it. Ferral saw Assistant District At
torney Weller, and he informed him that
Judge Conlan had assigned the case to
Judge Mogan's court. He went to Judga
Mogan, but was informed that the case
was not on his calendar and he had heard
nothing about It. So it was passed along.
As a last resort Ferral went to Judge
Cabaniss. as he was led to understand
that Cabaniss had been temporarily ap
pointed Presiding Judge by Conlan. Ca
baniss said he was getting tired of hav
ing such matters passed to him all the
time, and he thought one of the other
Judges should take the case.- Finally he
promised to look into the matter and said
if he could get another stenographer,
Howard Vernon having not yet recovered,
from, a serious illness caused by over
work, he might take the case himself. He
asked Ferral to appear with the defend
ant and the witnesses this morning- and
promised that some disposition would
then be made of the case. â¢ . .
A curious state of affairs was shown In
the police courts yesterday when ex-
Judge Ferral asked each Judge, one after
the other, to hear the preliminary exam
ination of Dora Fuhrig, the midwife
charged with murder In connection with
the death of Mrs. Hennineer of Folsom
street, about two weeks ago, and each
tried to shift the case.

Another miner or two will be sent down
the. shaft of the Exploration Company's
mine to-day.
Then Mr. Moore of the Grass Valley
people took him In hand and set him bur
rowing again. with the object of getting
the witness lost and confused under ground
and burying him there,- but Williams ap
peared ., to be well acquainted with what
he was talking about, and even John
Garber did not succeed in throwing dirt
into his eyes. .
Some oÂ£ the ore bodies were like aneur
isms on a human vein, of irregular and
unsymmetrical shapes,, often resembling
potatoes, flapjacks, onion omelets and lin
seed poultices as shown on the papier
mache model and explained by the
witness. Through all these the witness
worked in his testimony like a human
mole, often connecting one body. with an
other by . stringers or leaders of ore at !
least half an inch thick, so that when Mr
Lindley pulled him to the surface he
emerged triumphantly 'at the Pennsyl
vania apex. â¢
The whole day was taken up with the
direct and crons examination of John
Williams, " a miner from the Pennsyl
vania's diggings. His direct examination
by Curtis H. Llndley led him down the
shaft of the Exploration Company's
quartz mine and set him burrowing after
the ledges, veins and ore bodies tapped by
that shaft, directly and indirectly, by
means of drifts, stopes, inclines and other
things. He was then sent burrowing at
different, depths . until he had traced the
Sold bearing- deposits to the original apex

But the other side claims that they
have not given up the fight and other
complications are sure to 'follow.
Michael Mullaney, -who represented the
pla5ntiff, William Grant, said that the
sale placed the entire control of the prop
erty In the hands of his client and. that
the sale was llnal..
Some 90,000 shares of the capital stock of
the Tuolumne County Light and Power
Conipany were sold yesterday by Sheriff
Lackmann in front of the City Hall. One
lot represented the interest of J. R, Jar
boe and the other that of J. J. Crooks.
Attorney William Grant purchased Jar
boe's portion for $250 and secured the
Crooks lot of nearly 70,000 shares on a bid
Of $1000.
This places Grant In complete control of
the company, for out of the 100,000 shares
outstanding he now owns all except about
1700 shares. The sale was made by virtuÂ©
of a judgment and writ of execution Is
sued by the Superior Court of Tuolumne
County In a suit brought by Grant about
a year ago. Slg Simon, the Sheriff's
bookkeeper, acted as auctioneer, and al
though the bidding was not spirited,
Simon discharged his duties to the satis
faction of those most interested in the re
sults.
When the suit was originally brought
WJlliam Grant appeared as the plaintiff
and Paul R. Jarboe and J. J. Crooks as
the defendants. The suit was to recover
about $19,000 on a deficiency judgment. In
the maze of legal complications appear
the names of Prince Poniatowskl,. Ban
nister, the mining promoter, who was re
cently compelled to give up his gold
watch in satisfaction of a Judgment, and
the Columbia marble quarry, in which
most of the people named above are di
rectly interested. â¢ Regarding . the latter
phase a suit' Is now pending in the Su
perior Court of San Mateo County to de
cide who shall receive the $5000 a year
rental that the Grant side has attached.
So complicated is the situation that even
the attorneys concerned can scarcely give
a lucid explanation of the matter.
A portion of the stock sold yesterday
stood before judgment was rendered in
t*ie name of J. J. Crooks. Subsequently
it was transfered to his wife, Amanda C.
Crooks. Jarboe's stock was transferred
to his mother, Mrs. Mary H. Jarboe, and
under these names it was sold by the

regulation of the relations of labor and capital
is a problem we must meet and j3Olve; the un

In closing-. General. Chipman spoke of
the responsibilities devolving: upon com
rades. He Bald:
Confronted by Grave Problems.
It Is one of the pleasing memories that come
to me of the historic day when Abraham Lin
coln journeyed to Gettysburg to dedicate the
first National Cemetery to the dead- of the
â¢ Union army. I had the inexpressible happiness
to stand by his side as he spoke the immortal
words the recital of which is now made a part
of our ritualistic ceremony on Memorial day.
I see him now as he stood with bared head
looking out upon that great battlefield appar
' ently hesitating to speak In such presence. The
struggle with rebellion was at Its height, a
great battle had there been fought and . won
by the loyal army of the Union, but peace had
not yet come; nor was ultimate success of the
Union army an assured fact. All the contend
ing emotions of' his soul. Inspired by the awful
responsibility which rested on him as the Presi
dent of a great republic and the commander-ln
chief of its army and navy, seemed to be de
picted on his noble countenance. After a
sweeping look over the cemetery and a mo
ment's pause In hesitation he turned his care
furrowed face toward the vast throng around
him and. spoke as though In the presence of
the throne of God. .
There is something mournfully pathetic in
the thought that a splendid organization like
the Grand Army of the Republic, with such
an illustrious history, should have so brief an
existence: that. post after post must surrender
Its charter;, that department after department
must close Its headquarters; that the occa
sion for a National Encampment must soon
pass away, and that members of the Grand
Army will be found only in small groups scat
tered over this broad land until finally the na
tion will search out the small remaining bandâ
the last remnant of that Grand Army that
saved the Unionâ and will honor them as never
men have- been honored,' and .will tenderly
guard them until the Great Reaper shall have
summoned them to Join their . comrades "in
that undiscovered country from -whose bourne
no traveler returns." " ' 'V-- - Â¦"Â¦.*Â¦Â¦;
Pleasing Memory of Lincoln.
I do not think it is overstating? the fact when
I declare that the sentiment of comradeship
among the union veterans of the Civil War is
stronger than any other bond | of friendship
known to the social relations of -men, and
among the- numerous fraternal organizations In
this country I know of none where so sacred
a feeling of brotherhood exists as in the Grand
Army of the Republic. * * â¢
It is the consciousness that the Grand Army
of the Republic had Its origin in a voluntary
service on the field of battle, given Â¦ to our
Government when its very existence and the
preservation of constitutional liberty .were the
stake for which we fought, that our comrade
ship is so dear to us and that the simple badge
we wep.r means so much to us. Let no one
marvel: then that we honor the memory of the
dead and cherish the companionship of the liv
ing.
My friends. It Is difficult to realize how
rapidly the survivors of the Civil War are
passing away from these earthly scenes. It is
easy to fix the day not far distant when the
last remaining veteran of the Union army will
have been called to Join his comrades In the
realms of â¢ternal life. The muster roll of the
Grand Army in the year 1S90 showed a mem
bership of 400,489. The roll at the close of the
year 1900 showed 276,662. In a decade 123,827 had
ceased to answer rollcall. Thirty per cent of
our number died in a brief ten years.
The address, delivered by General N:
P. Chipman, was attentively listened to
by the audience. In'the course of his re
marks General Chipman said: -

"As a railroad man I can see no adx-an

po-called transcontinental systems."
Asked if he did not see in the Hill deal
reasons for the Pennsylvania wishing: to
make new Western connections. President
Rinley said that he could not see how the
purchase of the Burlington system could
disturb existing conditions in the Western
railroad or disturb such relations as have
existed between the Pennsylvania and
Burlington. Great transcontinental rail

â¬!scussed these days Ripley declared to be
"purely dreams." He added:
"I don't believe that the Pennsylvania
Interests have bought a single share of
Atehison stock or propose to do so. I can
see no reason for the Pennsylvania desir
ing to buy the Atchison nor can I see any
thing- that is likely to develop in the im
mediate future that -would change the
situation In this respect."
"I should welcome Pennsylvania Inter
ests, as the Pennsylvania management Is
one of the best managements. If not the
best. In the country- Purchase by the
Pennsylvania of Atchison securities
would establish greater confidence in the
property and be a good thing.

CHICAGO, Slay 7. â "As a stockholder in

Pennsylvania interests buy in the prop
erty even to gaining control, but I don't
believe there Is the slightest probability
cf this occurrinff."
This is the way President E. P. Ripley

MONTREAL. May 7.â Sir William Van
Ilrrne. chairman of the board of direct
ors of the Canadian Pacific Railway,
pneaking about a rumor that Morgan and
J-!:il had completed a deal to secure con
trol of the Canadian line, said: 'I have
r.<> time to answer imaginations of rpec
v:!ators in stocks. Canadian Pacific stock
la held by 15,000 or more individuals, and
there are not 100 holders who, combined,
could sell control. I do not believe that
a dozen are to be fotfnd who would If they
could. Many think, as I do, that the prop
erty is good enough to keep. I know very
little of the ups and downs of the stock
market- I only know that Canadian Pa
cific is worth more than many other
Ftocks now selling at par. Its value has
been overlooked in the great advance tiiat
has occurred in prices, and this fact
peems to have come to the mind of some
body. The directors have always given
their attention to the permanent welfare
of the property rather than to the stock
exchange quotations of the securities,
feeling sure that the securities would be
properly appreciated by the public In the
end."

FEET OUT.
Curious Habits.
When a r>erson has to keep the feet
Â«"ut from under cover during the coldest
eights In winter because of the heat and
1'i-irkiy sensation It is time that coffee,
vhich causes the trouble, be left off.
There is no end to the nervous condi-
tions that coffee will produce. 'It shows
in one way In one person and In another
v.-ay la another. In this case the lady
lived in Vermllllon, South Dakota.
She says: "I have had to He awake
J\alf the night with my feet and limbs
out of the bed on the coldest nisrhts and
f>el afraid to sleep for fear of catching
cold. I had bt-on troubled for years with
twitching and jÂ«rk!ng of the lower limbs,
and for most of the time I have been un-
able to so to church or to lectures be-
cause of that awful feellnff that I must
keep on the move.
"When 't was brought to my attention
that coffee ca-used so many nervous dis-
eases. I concluded to drop coffee and take
Postum Food Coffee to see if ray trouble
was caused by coffee drinking. I only
o"rank one cup of coffee for breakfast, but
that was enough to do the business for
nie. When I Quit It my troubles disap-
peared in an almost miraculous way.
Now I have no more of the Jerking an<l
twitching and'ean sleep with any amount
of bedding- over me and sleep all night, in
fcound, peaceful rest.
"Postum Food Coffee is absolutely
worth its weight in gold to me." This
lady's name can be given on application
to the Postum Cereal Co., Ltd., Battle

place as the result of good bidding, but holders
were too far above buyers' views and in conse
quence little business was executed. The close
was firmer at $26 12%@26 23.
While copper values abroad reacted 2s 6d to

situation "for that metal failed to vary . from
Its narrow and listless condition,' prices ruling
nominally as -before quotedâ $17 for Lake and
$16 621/4 for casting and electrolytic. Lead was
unchanged both here and abroad. . Spelter ruled
quiet and about steady at old prices, $3 9304.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, May 7. â To-day's stock market
showed all the gradations of sentiment from
buoyant at the opening to disorderly verging
1 on demoralization in the latter part of the day.
j The market hinged almost entirely on Northern
Pacific The extraordinary demand for that
stock continued and it almost dpuliCated yes-
I terday's rise, advancing an extreme 22V4, com
pared with 23 yesterday. In the early dealings
this strength retained a part of its sympa
thetic influence on the general market, but It 1
steadily lost that intluence. The reason for I
the rise exerting a depressing influence on the
rest of the market was shrouded in as much
mystery as the whole movement has been. As
the day drew toward the close rumors began
to gain currency that- the enormous demand
for this stock of the last two days was the
' result cf a desperate etfort to regain control
j on the part of insiders. The supposition is
; that the recent effort to secure control of
I Union Pacific led to a retaliatory movement
on the part of powerful capitalists who con
trol Union Pacific to embarrass the Northern
Pacific interests with an enforced contest to
I maintain their control. .'The success of the
' plan must be admitted. If such a struggle is
J really the cause of tne buying in Northern
j Pacific. The brokers employed in the buying
eerve as some ccrroboration for such a sup
position. A house which was credited with
buying 200,000 shares yesterday was a buyer of |
tens of thousands of chares to-day and was
at the same time lending out the stock for
the benefit of the shorts to an amount esti
mated at 100,000 shares, thus striving to allay
the alarm of the short interest and thus dis
couraging the hypothesis that the buying move
ment was designed for a squeeze against the
shorts. The appearance ratifer went to show
that the short interest was among the Insiders.
The presumptions which might flow from the
fact of such a struggle between great groups
of capitalists had a chilling effect on the whole
speculation. For one thing it would point to
a state of vindlctiveness between interests
which have been supposed to be working in
"accord. Instead of progress in a. community
of interests it would point to a growth of
gigantic rivalry with resultant power of com
petition exceeding anything in the railroad
wars of the past. It would indicate also that
the leading financial interest which has been
the conspicuous figure iu all the recent great
financial plans had been outgeneraled. There
were fears also that the collapse to follow the
volatile rise in Northern Pacific would un
favorably affect the whole stock market. The
rumors regarding Northern Pacific did not be
gin to takÂ« this form until late in the day.
Reports that the preferred stock was to have
the option of exchange with the common stock
and so doing away with its prior claims sent
Northern Pacific preferred up over 10 points.
Canadian Pacific continued its advance on the
theory that its prospective control by Northern
Pacific gave the latter stock its strength.
Union Pacific was run up to 13O',_ In an at
tempt on the part of its friends to rally it to
figures . commensurate with Northern Pacific.
These stocks constituted the really notable I
features cf strength in the market after the I
opening bulge, which was quite general and
was dua to the Inrush of buying orders from 1
the now widely extended speculative public.
Those opening gains ran from 1 to 2 points I
pretty generally and Irom 3 to 4 points In |
Sugar and Union Pacific. The quick inroads
made upon those prices by realizing and the
Impairment of the buying power discouraged
the continuance cf the rpeculatlon fo* the rise.
The higher rate for money and the demands
by brokers for larger margins also had a re
pressive Influence on speculation. The late
Felling was enhanced fcy the discouragement of
timid holder* who are only willing to hold on
a rise. The break at the last was severe,
reaching S? 4 in Northern Pacific, 8V_ In St.
Paul. 8 in Union Pacific. 5U in Rock Island,
5 in Baltimore and Ohio and between 2 and 5
points in the large -majority oÂ£ the active list.
The United States Steel stocks were again
under pressure througnout and the current gos
sip attributed this liquidation to a shifting of
holdlngb from the steel stocks into railroads. y
Prices closed above the lowest a3 bears took
quick profits, but the closing undertone con
tinued distinctly weak.
The bond market was quite active and ir
regular. Total sales, par value, $5,ES0,O00.
United States 5s declined Â»4 and the 3s >,i
per cent on the laEt call.

The Weather and Crops.
The report of A. G. McAdle. section director
cf the climate and crop section of the Weath
er Bureau, for the week ending Monday is as
GcJtoweR
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature has continued slightly be
'ow normal during the week, but there have
been no injurious frosts. Rain has fallen in
all parts of the State, varying in amount from
light showers to three and four Inches. The
precipitation has been sufficient to greatly im
prove the condition of crops In all sections.
Fogs have prevailed along the coast since the
rein.
Late Bown grain lias probably received
greater benefit from the rain than any of the
other crops, though the condition of all has
lx>en much improved. In places where it had
been feared that the late grain would be cut
only for hay. the outlook is now so much bet
ter that it is estimated a fair crop will b3
harvested. In portions of Southern California
the late wheat was past redemeption before
the rain. Early grain is in excellent condi
tion, and will yield a good crop in nearly all
parts of the State. Grain and hay were slight
\f damaged by rain and wind in some sec
lions. The soil is in excellent condition l'oi
cultivating. Sugar beets, beans, hops and
garden vegetables are in good condition. Green
3eÂ«"d had become scarce in tome sections, but
its condition has been improved by the rain.
The reports on the condition of deciduous
fi"jits> are so conflicting that it is impossible
to cive an accurate estimate of the damage
tiy irost or of the probable quantity of fruit
to be gathered, but nearly all reports agree
on the excellent quality of the young fruit,
end that the extent of injury has been over
fitiJiated. Grapes and fruit have been bene-
J'ti-i by the rain, and there has been but
Elurnt loss from the cracking of cherries an i
tfc-? rotting of early strawberries. Citrus fruits
are n good condition.
Shcransento Valley â Rain continued until
Â¦Wednesday throughout the valley, the amount
of nriclptation varying from 1.50 to 3.50
inches. It has been of immense benefit to
crops, particularly late sown grain, corn
anÂ«J vegetables. Orchards, vineyards and ho;j
fields have also been greatly benefited. Hig 1 !
virds accompanying the rain caused sltg^*
damage to era in and hay in some sections,
and the heavy rain injured cherries and ttraw Â¦
berries to some extent. Early grain If :n zx
cllent condition, and it is tow rt-p-jrtecl tint
th* rain icsures a heavy crop of l-itÂ» wain.
Hops are growing rapidly, and corn is looking
well. Haying is progressing. Decidiiuits :n:its
b.t in eood condition.
Coast and bay sectionsâ The rainstorm re
ported at th3 close of last week continued
until Wednesday, reaching all parts of the
district. The precipitation has been sufficient
to revive late sown grain, and in most places
it fs now reported that a good crop will be
harvested. Early grain is in excellent condi
tion, and will yield a large crop. The rain
has softened the soil, enabling farmers to re
sume cultivation. A large acreage of corn is
being planted. Grain and hay were but slight
ly damaged by the rain and wind. Pasturage
is becoming more plentiful. Many conflicting
reports concerning the condition of deciduous
fruits have been received, but it seems prob
eble the injury from April frosts was uot as
great as previously estimated.
San Jcaquin Valley â Generous rains fell
throughout the valley Monday and Tuesday,
and were of the greatest benefit to all crops.
The early portion of the week was partly
cloudy and the latter clear with warm days
and cool nights. The rain did but slight
carnage to the hay that had been cut and
Ereatly improved that standing. The condi
tion of the grain crop has improved wonder-
Jully; much that was thought would be a fail
ure will now r-roduce a fair crop. In mar.y lo
calities it ie estimated that the rain has in
creased the grain crop over 70 per cent. Fruits
of all kinds are in excellent "condition, and
vines are putting out new growth and look
thrifty. Haying continues, and the prospects
are for a fine crop. Green feed continues plen
tiful. Cultivation of vineyards and orchards
has been resumed, and the soil Is reported to
be in excellent condition. Stock is doing well.
Southern Californiaâ Rain has fallen in all
parts cf the district, and in some sections the
precipitation has been unusually heavy. Hay
has been considerably damaged, but late sown
jrrain and other crops have been greatly ben
efited. In some places a fair crop of late
wheat will b*> harvested, while in others
praln was part redemption before the rain
came. Early grain is in good condition. The
prospects for good crops of beans and pugar
beets have been gTeatly Improved. Deciduous
fruits were slightly injured by rain and bail
In some sections. Grapes and citrus fruits
are in good condition.
Eureka summaryâ Late rains and fogs have
improved the condition of grain, and given
new life to growing crops and fruit. Planting
of peas continues.
Los Angeles summaryâ A good, well distrib
uted rain greatly improved crops, orchards,
ti<?ans and summer crop lands. Late grain
was benefited; much will make a fair crop.
Seme mown hay damaged.
Dried Fruit in Nezv York^
Mall reports from New York say: "Demand
for prunes continues very fair on the spot.
End the market is firmly held. 4O-50S, 60-70s and
S^-lOOs being scarcest and the most wanted

cepting 40-50s and 90-100s. at the 2c basis, but
to far as can be learned no business of im
portance is doing, even at that price.
"Apricots en the spot show some movement,

Fome time in buying cheap lots still being in
the market for goods that can be picked up
under quotations. Apricots in bags are vir

CHICAGO," May 7.â Wheat showed most of Its
advance at the start on higher cables and light
Northwest receipts and the remainder of the
day was content with holding it. July opened
%Â©%c higher at 72%@72%c, and under general
demand' touched 72%@72%c For a time the de :
mand became small, and scattered realizing on
small lots caused a reaction to 72%c. Liberal
clearances and sympathy; with the somewhat
mvsterious strength of the May delivery caused
a%harp recovery to 73@73VÂ«c later. / Later, an
other-dip to 72%@72%c ' occurred, - but this was
followed by a recove'ry to 72%c and the doss
was firm, "%@%c higher, at 72%@72%c. May
sold between 72% and 74 1 /ic and closed lc up at
73%c. "The bulge in this option was credited to
the anxiety of the Eastern shorts over the pro
longed lake blockade and the engineers strike.
, Corn was quiet and ! generally .showed an
easier undertone. 'Phillips allowed . the market
for May to take care of Itself, inasmuch as he
comes near to being the whole market himself,
and little was done. July was worked down
during the forenoon, but most of - the decline

The stock market was brisk and irregular
to-day. The American department was lively,
though it was much less sensational than it
has been for some time. The market was In
clined to be more cautious. Recognizing the
heavy differences which exist at the end of
the present long account, jobbers are unwill
ing to make prices In Northern Pacific and
other skyrockets. Bull views prevailed,
nevertheless. The features to-day^ in this de
partment were the Pacific stocks, "particularly
Northern Pacific common, which, though â¢ it
opened well below, parity, resumert'its remark
able rise when New York opened and bulged
It. This caused a very buoyant close. Union
Pacific and the Atchlsons were supported, but
New York failed to help any other Issues, bo
that London was Inclined to. drag. St. Paul
hung heavy on a rumor that there was a
hitch in the combination plan. Canadian Pa

ing. There was a report that Hill was Join
ing the board of directors and that "the com
pany would be taken into the Northwestern
consolidation scheme. Money was steady. ;

SCHOOL BOARD DEMANDS
NOT PROPERLY CERTIFIED
Superintendent Webster Insists That
the Charter Provision Be.C'om
* plied With.
Superintendent of Schools Webster re
turned yesterday without his approval a
number of demands for salaries of labor
ers sent to him for his signature by the
Board of Education. The demands ag
gregated some 51200. The ground for
Webster's refusal to sign them was that
they were not properly certificated. The
charter provides that "every demand
shall have indorsed upon it a certificate
signed by the secretary of its approval by
the Board of Education, showing the date
thereof and the' law authorizing it by
title, date and section."
It was on this account that the suit of
P M Wellin. Inspector of schooihouse
re'pairs, was thrown out of court by Judge
Scawell. Wellin sued to compel \\ ebster
to sign his demand. Webster giving as a
reason for his refusal to audit it that
Wellin's services were not engaged in ac
cordance with the provisions of the char
ter Such demands have never contained
the proper certification in the past, and
Webster, taking his cue from Judge Sea
well's decision, will not sign them in the
future unless the certificate is attached.
Secretary Hanson of the Board of Educa
tion agreed to supply the certificate on
the demands and Webster will sign them
as scon as the formality is complied with.

night Lukes heard footsteps. "When they

DIPLOMAS ABE AWARDED
TO GRADUATING DOCTORS
Thoro are two other Baxter children,
inranOT. who arc being cared for at
TCapa. All three were given into the
mother's custody after the divorce was
granted, some time previous to her death.
The marriage of Miss Buford and Bax
iÂ»Â»r ten yfears ajro was a big event In
(Xapa County, where the Bufords occu
pied a very prominent position. It was
nnt long after the redding that stories
began to float about of unhappiness and
ri^fr'ect. Baxter became very much rtls
likf-d nmong the Bufords. and at last
long years of domestic difficulties culmi
nated in the divorce which freed Mrs.
P.axter from her negligent spouse. She
was the heiress to her father's large
properties, and her friends always de
clared that Baxter had an eye on the
prospective fortune of his wife.
"Baxter never exhibited any affection
for Marcellene," said Dr. Schofield, "and
there can be only one other reason for
his act, and that is" a belief that he can
force Mr. Buford to give up money."
â¢'This man Baxter is a rascal, and God
help him if I lay my hands on him,"
paid Mr. Buford. "My daughter died cf a
broken heart because of his 111 treatment
of her. I fed and clothed him and loaned
him several thousand dollars. I took this
rhild and have cared for her as tenderly
es I could. He shall never keep her as
long as I have the power to fight him."
Chief Hodgkins located the child and
Baxter at Kenwood. Sonoma County,
later on and notified the Sheriff at tjanta
Rosa to arrest Baxter and to secure the
child.
Mr. Buford arrived to-night from Xapa
R!id went directly to police headquarters,
where he swore to a warrant charging
Baxter with abduction.

The kidnaping on the 6treets to-day of
Marcellene* Baxter Buford, an eight-year
ol<i tfrl. made work for the Police" De
partment for several hours and created
consternation among those who were
watching .over the little one. Marcellene
Â¦was stolen while she was on her -way on
a bicycle to the Lafayette School from
her home, which is with Mrs. Dr. Carra
B. Schofield, 616 Fourteenth street. It i
' v\ s.s suspected as soon as the child's dis
appearance was known that the kidnaper
was her father. William F. Baxter, a
commercial traveler, who has long since
been deprived by law of the child's con
trol. He was subsequently found with
Marcellene in his possession.
Baxter married the daughter of S. H. \
Uulord, one of the most prominent and
wealthy ranchers of Napa County. She
tecured a. divorce from him on the ground
of r.egiect and cruelty.
The missing child, after her mother's
ocath last June, became the legal ward of
her rich maternal grandfather, who had
taken the little one into his home and had |
given her his name In the hope of effacing |
all recollection of the father, who had I
t.rought nothing but sorrow and distress
into the Buford home. The grandfather
was very anxious that the child should !
!.-e well reared and educated. That she !
might have nil ot the advantages of j
f-choolir.g lie decided to give her into the j
rare of Dr. Schofield. who had been one
Â«i the girlhood companions and intimates!
of Mrs. Baxter.
Three weeks agro little Marcellene was
brought to Oakland and Dr. Schofield, In
accordance with the desire of the grand
father, had the child put in a class at
'he Lafayette School.

This morning the little girl started off |
fit Â£:30 o'clock on her wheel for the I
schooihouse. which is at Seventeenth and ,
West streets, about six blocks from the j
Schoriold residence. About 10:30 o'clock |
Dr. Schofield, who had been out on a
professional call, returned to her home.
;\nd was summoned to the telephone by
a call from San Francisco. A man's
\oicr- said: !
"Marcellene will not be at home for
. jursch. 1 have her in San Francisco."
The surprised doctor was further In
formed that she would find the child's !
bicycle in the yard, where it had been Â¦
returned after the girl was taken. !
The wheel was found at the place indi- !
cited. ';
The mysterious message over the 'phone !
continued te the effect that the child
would not be returned to Dr. Schofield.
"Is this Mr. Baxter talking?" inquired i
The doctor. She was familiar with the j
family troubles.
"No." responded the speaker.
Dr. Schorield wired to the grandfather j
at Ncpa, who has the legal care of the I
child. Fortunately Mr. Buford was speed- I
iiy reached and he lost no time in notify
ing the police of Oakland and San Fran

BRIDE OF YEAR
SEEKS DIVORCE
Suit Is Quietly Brought
Against Young Will
Hopkins.
â â .Â»-
His Wife Also Enjoins Him
From Disposing of
His Estate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 7.
Love at first sight, an inherited fortune
and a -young: wife's dream of happiness
shattered almost before the echoes of the
marriage vows had been stilled are
some of the elements of a romantic story
told in a divorce complaint which has
been filed against William J. Hopkins in
the Alameda County Superior Court. The
defendant is a grand-nephew and an heir
of the latls Mark\ Hopkins. The young
man. who is better known among a wide
circle of friends- as "Billy" Hopkins, Is a
son of Mrs. Josephine E. Hopkins, who,
with her son and beautiful daughter, Miss
Mabel Hopkins, resided , for many years
in Oakland. Their home i.9 now in San
Francisco, where Miss Hopkins is said to
be one of the most charming of the Gold
en Gate's belles. .
The story of "Billy" Hopkins' marital
troubles has all the flavor of a modern
romance. . The wife, who fifteen month3
after shd became the spouse of Hopkins
seeks a divorce, was Miss Ida W. Platt
of Rumsey, Yolo County. â¢ Â¦ 'Â¦
Miss Platt and young Hopkins met at
Highland Springs during the winter of
3S9'J. She was a trained nurse, graduated
from Fabiola Hospital at OaKland, and
was at the springs on account of profes
sional business.
They were married at Larkspur In Feb
ruary of last year, and their troubles
commenced not a month after the wed
ding. The complaint, which charges
cruelty, neglect and intemperance, wa3
very quietly filed in the County Clerk's
office.
Mrs. Hopkins does not accuse her hus
band of beating her or of using physical
force upon her, but the cruelty she com
plains of is that which brings bitterness
and mental suffering. She declares that
she -was made the butt of her husband s
cruel nagging in public to her great hu
miliation. The grieving bride of a month
was forced, she recites, to see her hus
band . flirting with waitresses at the
springs where they spent their honey
moon. On numerous occasions Mrs. Hop
kins avers that she was made the target
of her husband's untoward actions, in
which pretty girls, employes of the hotel,
were the objects of his attentions.
On one occasion Mrs. Hopkins tells the
circumstances of a. debauch in which her
spouse was the central figure. During the
revelings he fired a pistol, arousing the
guests at the hotel, who discovered his
condition, much to his wife's humiliation.
The experiences cover the months be
tween February and October, when Mrs.
Hopkins left the springs .and came' to
Oakland. In November a child was born
to her at Fabiola Hospital. Since that
time, according to the complaint, Hop
kins' treatment of the mother has not im
proved. The complaint concludes with a
charge of intemperance as one of the
grounds for the legal separation the
youthful bride and mother has asked to
be- granted.
Tho financial side of the story is hardly
less, interesting, than that revealed con
cerning the purely domestic turbulence.
Before the ink was scarcely dry upon
the divorce complaint young Hopkins fell
into a fortune, the value of which is vari
ously estimated at between $100,000 and
1200,000, his portion of an estate left to him
In trust by his father, the late Orrin Hop
kins, who was Mark Hopkins' nephew.
Tho estate is composed of considerable
realty holdings and collateral reputed to
be of much value and situated in San
Francisco. Young Hopkins could not
come info absolute possession of his for
tune'until he reached the age of 25 years.
The estate was held In trust by W. S.
Hopkins and Edward Hopkins, his uncles.
On Sunday the young man attained the
age stipulated In the trust clause of the
will and he is now the sole owner of the
estate. - â¢ Â¦
But it will be of little service to him
until the divorce case is settled, because
Mrs. Hopkins has had an injunction
served upon her husband, which prevents
him from touching: his estate until the
case has been settled. Pending the litiga
tion she asked to be allowed alimony, the
amount of which shall be determined
after a hearing in court
The young man was served with the pa
pers at Hopland yesterday. His residence
during the past two years has been divid
ed hetween San Francisco and Highland
Springs, the latter resort being his favor
ite place of retreat. The divorce case was
brought in Oakland because Mrs. Hop
kina has made this city her legal place of
residence. Her relatives are prominent in
Yolo County.

from, to pay the water company. There
was not unanimity of opinion about the
proposition to retire Judge Hayne. City
Attorney Johnson was not present to
night so we could get no opinion concern

most superhuman work of the different
committees has somewhat relieved the
situation and it Is now believed that In
every instance those without proper food
and clothing were in a measure cared for
to-day and that to-night there are vastly
fewer people who were compelled to sleep
upon the streets. Two hundred tents were
erected , to-day, and while those were
crowded to-night with sleepers, this con
dition will be relieved to-morrow by the
arrival of 2000 tents from the general gov
ernment' at Washington, which will be
erected at once.
Provisions Supplied to tne Un

SUFFERERS FROM FIRE
ARE RAPIDLY RELIEVED
Miss Waldron 'attempted to Jump from
the fourth floor into tho life net. She
missed it, falling into the arms of half a
dozen policemen and firemen. She was
injured and taken to a hospital, as was
one of the men holding the net. Mrs.
Wanamaker attempted to jump into the
net. She struck the fire escape on the
first floor, receiving Internal injuries. She
was removed to a hospital. Carrie John
son, servant girl, is reported missing.
The fire started in a butter and egg
store. It spread rapidly, and In a few
minutes had eaten through the four other
houses, all five-story apartments. Mr.
and Mrs. A. M. Young, who lived on the
fourth floor of one house, Jumped from
the window of their apartment into a life
net. Mrs. Young received severe contu
sions and internal Injuries and was taken
to a hospital, as was her husband. A
man was Been at the window of one of
the third floor3 as if he were about to
jump. Then he disappeared, and It Is
feared he was either burned or smoth
ered to death.
NEW YORK. .May 7.â A fire which
started just before midnight on the
ground floor of the five-story apartment
house at 758 Lexington avenue drove
twenty or more families into the street
and many people had narrow escapes.
The police and firemen, aided by citizens,
rescued several i>ersons. Two were In
jured and taken to the Presbyterian Hos
pital and several are reported missing.

NARROWLY ESCAPE
DEATH BY FIRE
OMAHA, Neb.. May 7.â Golden-hai-ed
twelve-year-old Jessie Crawford made a
heroic rescue of her aged rather. James
Crawford, this morning. He is a fisher
man and resides near the banks of the
Missouri River.
After arriving in midstream his boat
struck a snag, and in a violent effort to
clear himself he was capsized Into the
fiercely flowing Missouri. Jessie was on
the bank when her father shouted for
help, and without a moment's hesitation
she clambered into a rowboat and with
strong, well-directed strokes sent the boat
athwart the rapid current, reaching the
point of her" father's accident Just In time
to catch him as he rose for the third
time. '
By strenuous efforts the child was able
to raise part of her unconscious parent's
body from the water and pull It across the
stem of the boat. Then she carefully
rowed to the shore. Friends saved the
father, and Omaha's Grace Darling col
lapsed in an attack of hysterical happi
ness.

Each succeeding day adds to the convlctlom
of shareholders that the Montezuma Mining
Company of Washington has the brightest
_ outlook of any newly organized mining com-
pany in the West, or for that matter in th*
United States to-day. Our stockholders arÂ»
a satisfied lot, and. to the best of our knowl-
edge, not one of them would part with hi>
holdings. This, in view of the widespread
discontent amongr the holders of oil stock. Ia
a significant fact.
The Montezuma Company rigidly adhere,
as they always will, to the co-cperative idea.
This they could well afford to do from purÂ«
selfishness It for no other reason. Now that
the properties arÂ« bein? brought- to a tahr
stage of development and aince the larg*
coal leases have been secured capital Is net
lackingâ to secure a controlling Interest. But
these valuable properties will arways remain
under tha control of the numerous holder*
of Montenma shares. The paopls wnÂ» ar*
helping to build cp the business may depend
absolutely upon sharing in th* profits.
, There is every reason to believe, that th*
Montezuma Mining Company will be to Wash-
ington what the Mountain Copper Company
of Shasta County Is to Californiaâ th* leader
in the copper Industry and the biggest divi-
' dend payer in the State. The Mountain Cop-
per Company -was exploited In Sngland and
hundreds of English people profit from its
products, over ll.OCO.OCO having bees paid ia
dividends tor 1900 and $500,000 added to th*
reserve fund. It is the fixed intention of th*
Montezuma Company that the people of our
own country be given the exclusive privlleg*
of contributing to its development fund and
thereby share exclusively in the profits. Ths
Montezuma has many natural advantages
that the Mountain Copper Company does not
possess. First, its proximity to ths seaboard,
being only forty miles from th* port of Ta.
coma on I'ugct Sound; second, a self-fusins
ore carrying high percentages of copper:
third, abundance of timber and water on lti
own properties; fourth, the production of Its
own ccal and coke from its 2000 acres of
leased lands; fifth, the consumption of this
coke in Its own smelter in the reduction of
its ores. "Money saved Is money earned."
and the Montezuma Company will be abl*
to keep operating expanses very low.
"We quote from the prospectus: "Resolved.
That it is the fixed policy of this company
to distribute as dividends to stockholders all
net profits earned by the company. We are
opposed to the policy of reinvesting such
earnings without the consent of the stock-
holders, believing ' that whatever benefits
them conduces to the interests of the com-
pany." This means that while dividends
will be paid this fall from the coal and coke,
no portion of the surplus earnings therefrom
can be used to continue development on tha
copper properties or for the building of a
smelter. Stock must be sold to accomplish
both these objects. The -company's pay roll
Is now approximately *$3C00 a month, and will
be- very largely Increased during the sum-
mer. The company cannot, therefore, takÂ» -
the risk of having their revenue curtailed by
advancing the stock at once to Its true values.
It is for this reason that only a nominal
advance is made from month to month. Th*
advance after the payment of th* promised
dividend â "but that's another story."
The prices now, and until May 15, owing to
a concession made to us by th* Montesuta*
Company in honor 3f "Presidential week,"
when many of our country clients plan to
-visit us and Increase their holdings, ar* 19*
cash or 12c on easy installments. The pur*
chaaer of 3CC0 shares will be entitled to a
trip to the mines and return at oar expense.
Our special train leaves *San Francisco Jun*
15, touching at principal Sound points. Far*.
Including sleeper. $40 for the round trip. Oar
excursion folder will give % full information.
We will supply Montezuma prospectus, map*

WOODLAND, May 7.â The irrigation
problem seems to be in a fair way of so
lution. The last of the heirs to the
Moore estate, who has been holding out,
signed an agreement last night to sell
his interest in the Moore ditch property.
All the owners of the Stephens- Adams
system had previously signed the same
agreement. If there is.no further hitch
T. L. Reid, the oil operator, will pur
chase both systems and reorganize on a
more comprehensive scale. He will at
once put surveyors in the field to ascer
tain the amount of available water that
can be taken fiom Cache Creek, the cost
of applying it to the land, and how large
a district can be profitably irrigated.
It is conceded that this is the beginning
of one of the most valuable enterprises
ever inaugurated in the State of Cali
fornia. Experts say that this system will
place subject to Irrigation 15O,Cut) acres of
the best land in California, and the cost
of construction and maintenance will be
less than in any other place in the arid
West. In no other place in California, or
even in the West, has nature contributed
bo much to the physical construction
necessary to the development of a system
of Irrigation aa In the case of the natural
reservoirs df Clear Lake, the natural de
clivity of the channel of the bed of Cache
Creek, and the presentation of so large,
level, fertile and accessible a surface to
which the waters of the reservoirs and
the creek may be applied.

"I have nothing to say. The statement

LONDON, May 7.â Simultaneously with
td-day's meeting of the Leyland UnÂ«
shareholders to vote upon the agreement
with J. Pierpont Morgan comes a reitera
tion of the . statement that Morgan
is about to acquire the Red Star line as
well as the Atlantic Transport line. The
Leyland line shareholders unanimously
confirmed the Morgan-Ellerman agree
ment. The American officials here, how
ever, deny the report that Morgan has ac
quired the Red Star line. After Mattln-
Bon, who presided at the Leyland Una
meeting, had explained the terms of to*
contract Ellerman, chairman of the line,
set forth his views on the trans-Atlantic
trade. He said the outlook was not prom
ising for British ship owners In view of
the large American tonnage building, tha
prospects of the return to that trade of
vessels now diverted to South Africa and
the probability of an American subsidy.
He did not believe Parliament would In
flict countervailing: duties on subsidized
American vessels. Morgan's railroad and
manufacturing interests would enable him
to make the purchase of the Leyland line
profitable. â¢ '
Ellerman severely criticized the anti
quated British navigation laws, which put
British vessels at an increasing: disadvan
tage In competing with foreigners. Mat
tinson said the Americans were evidently
in the trans-Atlantic trade to stay. TradÂ©
does not follow the flag; it follows capi
tal. The conditions favor their success.
The fact that this particular purchase has
been possible has been a grave warning
to Great Britain to revise the navigation
laws, which threaten her supremacy.
NEW YORK, May 7.â James A. Wright,
second vice president of the International
Navigation Company, was shown the dis
patch from London referring to the re
iterated report that Morgan was about to
acquire the Red Star line. He said:

DANG AH M.UKY IS
ORDERED DEPORTED
Widowed Hairdresser Captured in the
Recent Federal Raid Must Re
turn to China.
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday decided that Dang Ah
Muey was not lawfully in this country
Â¦jid recommended her deportation.
Ex-Judge Henry C. Dibble, her attor
ney, tried to prove by Chinese evidence
that she was a native of San Jose, that
she was a widow and by occupation a
hairdresser, but the witnesses on the is*
sue of the woman's nationality were not
of the character necessary to impress the
mind of the Commissioner with their
credibility.
Judge Heacock complimented United
States District Attorney Woodworth upon
the zeal, thoroughness and intelligence
with which he was prosecuting the Chi
nese slave cases and said that the num
ber of deportations already secured were
due to Mr. Woodworth's excellent hand
ling of the cases.
In the press of to-day we learn that certain
interests are brought to bear which can pre
vent a general strike. Because of the manner
in which those who are credited with the above
mentioned statement have endeavored to show
in the past few weeks, through misrepresenta
tion, their authority In labor matters over
which they have no control, the public is led
to believe that their jurisdiction extends over
the entire labor field of this and other cities
of this State and in the absence of a. definition
of their position by ' themselves it becomes in
cumbent upon the Building: Trades Council, In
behalf of the thousands of - members and - the
best interests of California to show to the resi
dents of this and other cities of this State, and
also to those who are about to become our
guests that the building- industry and those en
gaged'in it are not governed, controlled by, ad
vised, dictated to or directed by" Messrs.''Rosen
berg and Pierce, who are now receiving the at
tention of the public as the directing element
because of the persistency Â¦with which the afore
said gentlemen connect themselves with matters
over which they have no control.
That it is again necessary for. the Building
Trades Council to declare to the people of this
State that the building trades are in perfect
harmony with their employers in every depart
ment of the â¢ building industry and will not
allow any outside or foreign influence to disrupt
the aforesaid harmonious relations, nor will, it
brook any influence from anybody purported to
tepresent any prerogative power. Recent prints
concerning the realty market and building in
dustry in this city have had a damaging effect
by reason of their reference to labor troubles
and it is In order to obviate any impression
that might have gained ground through this
erroneous statement that the Building Trades
Council desires it to be understood that the
building industry of San Francisco, and all en
gaged therein, were never enjoying a more
harmonious relation than they are to-day.
Realizing that the progress and advancement of
the city and State is proportionately benefited
to those engaged in the building industry, the
employers doing- business in San' Francisco
could bo very much improved were it not for
the stand taken by certain unions . affiliated
with the Building: Trades Council. '
Holbrook at once offered a vigorous ob
jection and said that Hanlev had talked
to Officer McCurrie of the society before
the case was called and had asked him to
agree to a dismissal, as he knew the de
fendants. McCurrie refused and said he
would leave the case to the Judge to de
cide. McCurrie was called to the stand
and corroborated Holbrook's statement.
Hanley said that he' merely conversed
with McCurrie to see what was In the
case, as he always did, but made no sug
gestion that.it should be dismissed tla
after the Judge had heard the evidence.
The case was continued till to-day for
further expert testimony. Secretary Hol
brook says that he will make formal ap
plication to the Mayor to remove Hanley
from office, as he has on other occasions
shown a disposition to favor defendants.

bull had been cruelly treated and almost
dismembered by the two defendants, who
had to kill it. as it. was dying. Two ex

the case be dismissed.

Samuel W. Knowles, husband of Mrs.

tically the same as his wife as to O'Hare's
condition. Other witnesses examined
were T. H. Raynold/ of, the Western
Union Telegraph Company, who testi
ned_as to certain telegrams, and Charles
McCoIIum of the Hibernia Bank and Wil
liam Schmidt of the German Savings
Bank, as to money that had been on de>
posit in O'Hare's name and withdrawn.
The case was then continued until this
afternoon.
Just before the closing of the day's pro~
ceedings young Jacques walked out to
where the old, man was sitting, and At
torney Judkins at once stopped him. At
torney Cannon. drew the attention of the
court to the fact, and Knight said that
O Hare had beckoned to young Jacques.
Miss Tillie Rodgers, who was seated in
the center of the courtroom, jumped to
her feet and denied that there was any
beckoning on the old man's part. There
was a prospect, of a lively row when the
Judge put a stop to it. As O'Hare was
being led away the Jacques family waved
their hands arid smiled to ' him. Young
Jacques thereupon remarked, "You see
he does know us."

AFTER three weeks of litigation
Judge Coffey has appointed Mary
L. Gowdey guardian of the per
son and estate of her brother,
Joseph O'Hare. Up to a few
weeks ago O'Hare resided with Thomas
G. Jacques, a retail merchant of this
citj'. It was alleged by various petition
ers for letters of guardianship that when
O'Hare went to reside with Jacques he
was possessed of several thousand- dol
lars. At the present time he has ! only
a few hundred dollars to his credit. There
was no opposition to Mrs. Gowdey's peti
tion, it being generally understood that
Jacques will present his case in other ac
tions which will be instituted.
The interested parties then went to
Judge Cabaniss* court, where the prelim
inary examination of Thomas G. Jacques
and his wife. Caroline E. Jacques, on the
charge of kidnaping O'Hare, was heard.
The old man had been brought from
Minneapolis by his brother-in-law,
Joshua Rodgers. the Controller there,
and his niece, Miss Tillie Rodgers. He
was in court, and his appearance was
ACCUSES HANLEY
OF FAVORITISM
"Vina- Lally. It was said that the families
had been reconciled and were prepared
to jointly prosecute the Jacques family
for kidnaping andÂ» grand larceny. Attor*
neys Cannon and Judkins . appeared as
special counsel for the prosecution, and
Attorney George A. Knight represented
the defendants. .
The evidence taken yesterday was
mainly intended to prove that O'Hare
had been for months incompetent . to
transact any business. The first witness
examined was Mrs. Margaret J. Knowles,
who now lives at Golden Gate, Alameda
County. â¢ She formerly lived at 542 Jessie
street, this city. She testified that shp
had known Joseph O'Hare for the past
twenty-five years. About, two years ago
he came to her house and engaged a
room. Last September he had a "stroke"
and after that his memory failed him and
he hardly knew what he was doing. She
believed he was Incompetent. In cross,
examination she admitted that she had
talked with Mrs. Gowdey about the old
man, but added that all she wanted was
to see that justice, should be done hJm.
Dr. C. J. Patton testified that he had
been called In by Mrs. Knowles to at
tend the old man last October. He found
him in a feeble condition mentally and
physically and suffering probably from
dementia. He did not prescribe for him,
as drugs would not do him any good. He
did not think O'Hare was of sound mind.
Dr. D. D. Lustig testified to having
had a conversation with the old man on
.Monday. He was of the opinion that
O'Hare was incompetent to conduct any
business, and that he had probably been
so for months. He was suffering from
softening of the brain.
APPZAL IS MADE FOR .
BEPAVING OF STREETS
finance Committee of Supervisors
Will Favorably Report on Petition
of Merchants' Association.
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the Mer-
chants' Association, addressed the Super
visors' Finance Committee yesterday and
urged that appropriations be made for the
repaying of streets, for placing the fire
alarm and police telegraph wires under
ground and for the buj.ding of a new pest
house on the Bay View Farm. C. J.
King, also representing the association,
said that a systematic district plan of
repaving streets was being prepared by
the Board of Public Works. For this
purpose $125,000 per year would be required
for a period of four years. Mr. Dohr
mann favored the purchase of the Bay
View Farm, containing four and a half
acres, for a pesthouse site at a cost of
$12,500. The ct>st of the building was esti
mated at $5000. The committee decided
to recommend that the money be appro
rriated for the establishment of the pest
hcuse.
Rev- Father Smith of the Paulist.
Fathers and George Chadburne petitioned
the committee for an appropriation of $50,
000 for the construction of St. Marv's
Square. Father Smith stated that if the
appropriation was made the suit pending
to determine the status of the fund of
$125,000, now tied up in the city treasury,
would be abandoned. The committee
thought that the only way to get the ap
jnopriation would be to levy a tax outside
of the dollar limit if the board should
favor the plan.
The Civil Service Commission notified
the committee that in consequence of the
denial by the Supreme Court of a rehear
ing in the suit affecting the county offices
its estimate of the money required to run
It* department for the next fiscal year is
reduced from $12,700 to $8100. This will
pay the salaries of the three Commission
ers, chief examiner, one clerk and one
stenographer.

held in the office of Mayor Phelari at the

Expected to attend. A general exchange
of, opinions, it is hoped,' will result in pro
ducing, harmony between employers and
employes."- . -
Meetings of labor organizations were
held last night all over the city. In nearly
every instance sympathy was expressed
for the striking ; cooks and waiters and
resolutions imposing fines upon' members
patronizing "unfair" houses were adopt
ed. In other cases walkouts were ordered.
The bakers as a body decided to go out
this morning, and the Pacific Coast Asso
ciation of Cooks, which includes some of
the chefs in the principal hotels and clubs,
adopted resolutions to stand in with the
strikers. E With the bakers and the cooks
out it looked decidedly blue' for. the res
taurant men at midnight. .
All was Jubilation at the headquarters
of. the Cooks' and. Walters' Alliance at
B'nai B'rith Hall. More than a hundred
members of the original Cooks' and Wait
ers' Association, alter the result was an
nounced, marched up Market street, vo
ciferously cheering. , At the meeting of
the strikers, as soon as the result was
announced, it was wildly cheered.' The
bakers' delegation was accorded a similar
reception. At the meeting of the restau-"
rant proprietors in the Shiels building all
was gloom. During the day three restau
rant proprietors made assignments and
one place was closed under attachment.
Chairman Johnson declined to disedss the
situation. ' .
Carriage Workers Strike.
The three branches of the carriage trade
âblacksmiths, painters and buildersâ held
a meeting at Pythian Castle and decided
to walk out this morning. Demands as
to hours and pay have been conceded by
their employers. The single reservation
made was, according to President H. M.
Black and Secretary Nugent, that the em
ployers should have the right to engage
those whom they chose without regard to
union affiliations. The men refused this
concession' and will go out.
At the close of the meeting of the 'Cooks
and Walters at B'nal B'rlth Hall the fol
lowing statement, signed by National Or
ganizer Pierce and Secretary Rosenberg
of the Labor Council, was given to the
press: Â¦ . .
Faster and faster this city is moving toward
the most critical period in its history.. Broad
minds and coolness can. avert a general strike
of the workers of the city. The San Fran
cisco Labor Council for some weeks past' has
exhausted the services of its best men to pre
serve peace .in this community, but their ef
forts seemed to have failed, and failed be
causs the fiat has gone forth 'from the em
ployers of this city that the trades unions
must be disrupted. They never will be. Prog
ress will not nor. cannot stop.' The trades
unions stand for progress. If the employers
persist, the trades -unionists will insist and the
growth of this city will be retarded for year3.
We here give warning.
Demand "Hands Off."
"We again ask "hands of!" ft-om the flght of
the cooks and waiters for the shorter work day
and one day's rest in seven. We ask "hands
oft"' from the demands of the Carriage Work
ers' unions. Their employers were ready to
enter into agreements to recognize - their em
ployes' right to organize, but Front street
threatened and to-morrow morning 300 carriage
blacksmiths, . painters and woodworkers will
not return to their work. And ; because the
union bakers could not any â¢ longer work in
bakeries with restaurants connected where
Japanese took the place- of union cooks and
waiters, 1M union bakers quit work to-night.
The threats of the employers to disrupt the
trades unions have caused this. And the fate3
only know bow many, workers may be out a
day hence. The Labor Council has made Its
last effort to prevent s. general strike. The
executive officers of the council and some. of
the principal unions waited the other day on
the Mayor and urged upon him to arrange a
Joint conference of the principal employers of
the city and representatives of organized labor.
That conference will bring peace or industrial
war. We want peace, and we want peace now.
The chief executive of our nation nears our
city -more than ever. But human endurance
has reached its limit. On all hands the em
ployers are forcing the issue and on - their
heads must rest the responsibility.

TROUBLE AHEAD
FOR TREASURER
Copyist "Would Stop
Payment of Brooks'
Salary.
?
W. H. Garnett Whose De-
mand "Was Held Up Plans
Retaliation.
The payment of the salary demands of
three copyists in the Recorder's office by
Deputy Treasurer John O. Reis to the ex-
elusion of a fourth copyist may. involve
Treasurer Brooks in serious trouble.
William H. Garnett, the copyist whose
salary demand for April was not paid al
though his three associates received
their money notwithstanding the written
protest of the Civil Service Commission,
declared yesterday that he will bring
mandamus proceedings to compel Treas
urer Brooks to pay his demand in, the
same manner as the others were . paid.
Further than this, Garnett says he will
file a written protest with the Auditor
against the pavment of Brooks' salary on
the ground that the Treasurer has-been
absent from his post of duty for a period :
of two months past without permission
from the Mayor. ' -"- â¢ . â¢> â¢ .
"When the Civil Service Commissioner
served notice on the Treasurer â¢ not â¢ to
pay the demands of the four copyists ap
pointed by Godchaux outside of the civil
service eligible list the matter was com
municated to Brooks, who then ordered I
the question referred to the City Attorney
for adjudication as to his right to hold up
the demands. Though no opinion has yet
been received Deputy Reis took it upon
himself to pay three of the copyists for
April but refused to pay Garnett's de
mand. Garnett claims that Reis' action
was done advisedly in order to compel the
Institution of court proceedings to settle i
the disputed point as to whether the
deputies in the Recorder's office are alone i
exempted from civil service under the Su- J
preme Court decision.
Garnett will meet the issue and as a
method of retaliation he will incidentally
attempt to restrain the Auditor from au
diting Brooks' t-Mary demand. Auditor
"Wells says that if the protest is filed he
Â¦will certainly hold up Brooks' demand
until the matter is settled legally. ' / '
