CHARITY SWINDLERS ARE DEMORALIZED
AND SWIFTLY SCURRYING TO COVER
Just how much money these bands of
schemers have obtained . In this city j
in the past few months may never
be known. Mamlock, who has known
Doneghy for fourteen years, declared
yesterday Â¦ that the chief worker
'had. carried ' on his schemes for
that length of time all over the coun
try and was reputed to have drawn from
charitable persons the epormous sum of
$500,000. Doneghy has always had the rep
utation of being a liberal spender and as
fast as the coin would come In it would
be. flung away, so he is not supposed to
be possessed of any great amount of
wealth at present.
Mamlock. yesterday made a weak at
tempt to clear himself of the accusation
of having sold tickets for a bogus' society,
and the police were obliged to accept his
statements, with reservations, as there
was no charge sworn to on which they
could hold him. Assistant Secretary Mil
ler of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion has a number of letters in his posses
sion from people who bought tickets, but
Miller positively refused yesterday to
furnish, the police with the names, even
when it was pointed out to him that such
cence, while giving damaging testimony
against their erstwhile associates.
Mamlock is a shrewd advertising agent
and is a glib talker. Ho declared with
considerable surprise that in printing tho
tickets he did not think that any one in
San Francisco would be deceived in tha
name, "California Boys* and Girls' Aid
Society," and that no one would confound
It with the Boys and Girls* Aid Society
located in this city. He- claims that ha
Instructed his women canvassers "to be
sure and explain to people that this con
cert is for a society located in Pasadena,
Southern California."
When asked why he did not explain this
on the face of the ticket, Mamlock
pleaded that "It had never occurred to
him."
Miss Belle Smith, Miss Julie Howie and
Mrs. C. E. Wilcox were closely questioned
yesterday and were willing enough to
talk. Their stories were the same in each,
case. They claimed that Mamlock had
given them.. instructions to "be sure and
tell every one not to confound this society
for the one in San Francisco; that ours
Is in Pasadena." ;
All three women, however, were forced
to admit that on many occasions they
had presented tickets for sale, but had
not made any explanation as to where tha
"California Boys' and Girls* Aid Society"
was located. The women readily admit
ted that It was possible that purchasers
of the tickets believed they were buying
them in order to assist the society located
in San Francisco.
Mamlock and the three women are liv
ing in a boarding-house at the corner of
DID NOT INTEND
ANY DECEPTION
"When questioned further, Mamlock ad
mitted that he had no written authority
from Salisbury to give concerts, "only a
verbal authority." On being asked for the
power of attorney, Mamlock was obliged
to admit that he only had a "verbal per
mission" to sign Salisbury's name.
I have his power of attorney to act for
him and sign his name to all documenta.
I have tried to get up concerts for other
societies in San Francisco, but Doneghy
was here ahead of me."
THERE was a^ general scurrying
to cover yesterday on the part
of. the . professional : charity
schemers and an eager desire on
the, part. of.. many of them to ex
culpate themselves by making
confessions as to the doings of their as
sociates. "'

Mrs. C. E. Wilcox were taken into cus

"I will admit that the expose In The
Call has put an end to my business, legit
imate or illegal. I am ready to get out of
this kind of work and am sorry I ever
went Into it. I have a family, and I don't
want to get Into any trouble. I am will-
Ing to return all the money to those who
bought my tickets and send the three
women back to their homes In Los An
geles. I suppose It is correct to call
Doneghy's work by the name of 'grafting,*
but there is nothing illegal In It. My girl3
have not sold many ticketsâ about fifty
four, that is all. The write-ups in The
Call made it rUfficuIt for them to sell
many. I am telling the truth when I say
that Mr. Salisbury, the president of the
Boys* and Girl3' Aid Society in Los An
geles, gave me his authority to give con
certs for his society in. any part of the
State. If he telegraphs back that he did
not give me authority to do so it may be
because he does not know that I have
started in to work up a concert in San
Francisco. I put the name 'California
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society* on the tick
ets because hs told me that his society
was a State institution. I did not think it
was necessary to add the words 'of Pasa
dena* to the tickets. Honestly. I never
gave It a thought, and did not think any
one in Frisco would be deceived by the
ticket. I saw Mr. Bayley of the Boys*
and Girls' Aid Society out near the park
and tried to get up a concert for him.

The knowledge that the police were tak

eager to talk. In a voluble manner he
told how he had known Doneghy for four

hundred yards south of the depot and is
said to' be invariably operated, when
changes are required, by the conductors
or brakemen of passing trains. Three
trains crossed the switching point during
the day, and It Is known that in the early
afternoon the lock had not been opened
by railroad employes to divert traffic from
the main line. After the accident the
lock was still Intact, but the switch had
been turned.
The natural presumption and the one
generally entertained by the railroad men
here is that some person possessed of a
key to the switch lock, opened it after the
third train had passed, swung the switch,
and then replaced the lock. They can
assign no other reason for the disaster. In

LOS ANGELES, June 1 6.â President John C. Salisbury of the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, the headquarters of which is at South Pasadena, declares that Harry Mamlock is in no way authorized by the*society to give
a benefit concert in San Francisco in aid of the society. He said to-night: ' ' .
"lam astonished to hear, that Mamlock is attempting such a thing in the north. I did not think he would dare to do such a thing. If he is collecting money in San Francisco for such a benefit he is acting
without authority and should be considered an impostor. There is a society with a name like ours somewhere near San Francisco arid it is possible' he is arranging a benefit for that society. He certainly is not repre
senting us." - : â¢;' , .
Mamlock managed a benefit concert in aid of the South Pasadena institution at Blanchard's~Hall in this, city on -May 30. Two nights previous he gave a similar benefit in Pasadena. In each case he was to give the
society 20 per cent of the receipts. President Salisbury says Mamlock has not settled with the society for either performance and that the institution has as yet leceived nothing from the benefits. Salisbury estimates that the Los
Angeles benefit box receipts amounted to more than $500. Mamlock told him, however, that he had lost money, as the expenses were heavy. .

CHICAGO, June 16.â Sitting on the left

in attending the divine services of con

tion of the University of Chicago. The

Elon Mr. Rockefeller was almost ex

day. Mr. Rockefeller will deliver the con
vocation address at the university Tues
day, i .
but he would have nothing to do with it.
"I don't want to get into trouble, and
I am willing to sign any statement The
Call asks me to sigh. I will turn the
money I received from the tickets over to

let them try to find the purchasers and
refund the money. I am through with
this kind of work."
Mamlock admits that Doneghy's books
and papers are in his room under lock
and key. He says that Doneghy brought
a bundle of books and papers to his room
a day or two ago and locked them ln a
small closet. The key to the Yale iock is
in Doneghy's possession.
SLAP AT EDWARDS
AND WEINBERG
Mamlock declares Welnberg and Ed
wards are "no good." Weinberg is the
man who was employed by Mrs. Pettee as
secretary of the Universal Service So
ciety, and Edwards was engaged by
Doneghy to manage his concerts. Mam
lock says Edwards told a He when he
said that Doneghy had never given him
(Edwards) any jnoney.
"Why, on Saturday afternoon." said
Mamlock, "I saw Doneghy pay Edwards
some money. As for Weinberg. he. is
hand and glove with Doneghy. Weinberg
made a suggestion to Doneghy that he
would go out dressed as a minister to sell
tickets."
That Mamlock was prepared to do a big
business in selling- tickets for the "Cali
fornia Boys' and Girls' Aid Society" is
shown by the large number of tickets he
had printed. He yesterday exhibited a
drawer filled w<th the tickets, probably
2000 In number. TThe tickets were printed
on cards of four colors. Miss Howie sold
the yellow tickets. Miss Smith sold those
of a drab color. Miss McDonald had lav
ender tickets and Mrs. WIlcox disposed of
blue ones. By these colors, Mamlock
could tell what portion of the city was the
best for his scheme, and at the same time
keep "tab" on the ticket sellers. Â¦ â¢â¢
The tickets issued by Mamlock for hia
"society" and those placed on sale by thÂ«
Doneghy-Barnes-Deiweiler combination,
as well as those of Mrs. K. C. Gregory,
alias Miss C. C. Graham, have no check
number upon them. Thousands of the
t'.ckets were printed and the object of the
workers was to dispose of as many of
them as possible. By this means.it would
be Impossible for the officials of a genuine
society, for which the tickets might be
sold, to find out how much money was
collected by the schemers.
The usual custom followed when charit
able or fraternal societies give benefit con
certs Is to have all tickets numbered con
secutively and impressed with the stamp
seal of the organizations. This prevents
fraud and at the same time enables the
fcocieties to tally exactly the number* of
tickets disposed of by canvassers.
It is well known that in the "past few
months every street in the down-town
portion of the city has been covered by
the ' "charity workers." Doneghy . and
Helen Barnes have had twelve women at
work: Mamlock had five ticket sellers and
Mrs. Gregory is reported to have had four
assistants.
"With this number of "charity workers"
engaged in selling tickets it would be an
easy matter to bring in $200 to $500 per
day. The trained "workers" employed by
Doneghy were also used to "break in" the
3 r oung women hired in this city. When
the novice was considered an "expert" she
was launched out to cover a certain dis
trict alone. They were given a commis
sion on their sales In addition to salaries.

The camp was open to-day from, past
past 9 o'clock to half past 5, and a. large
number of the troops took advantage of
the license to seek' the town and spent
time and money among the many attrac
tions of the little seaside city. But at
half past 5 the stragglers were coming in
on the run, and ' when the gates \ were
closed "and the road to camp was made
to end at the guard tents there were still
more on the way, and there is trouble In
store for them all.
This evening there was a meeting of the
general officers of the carno and a plan
for the week was decided upon. The three
generals were called to Major General
Dickinson's tent after supper. The con
ference lasted for more than an hour and
a plan of field marches for each brigade
was the result. To-morrow afternoon the
Third Bridage, under command of Gen
eral Muller, will start .out. The big trees
at Felton will be the destination and there
the brigade will camp for the night. The
march will be made as if through the
enemy's country. Flankers, an advance
guard and a rear guard and cavalry scouts
will be thrown out and the march will be
made with all precautions observed ln
war. A map of the country Â¦ thfbugh
which the troops will pass must be made
and every stream and every cross road
and every farmhouse must be marked
upon it in proper scales. Lieutenant
Colonel Draper, division engineer, will ac
company the brigade and General Dickin
son will be represented by one of his staff,
probably Inspector General Hosmer.
Work for Marching Men.
The, fullest written reports of the march
must accompany the maps and the whole
must be submitted to General Dickinson
as a report of operations ln the field. No
restrictions will be placed upon Brigadier
General Muller. He will be allowed to
make his march as he pleases and must
eelcct his own camping ground for the
night he will spend with his brigade away
from camp. The men will be in heavy
marching order and with one day's ra
tions. The distance is about ten miles.
Tuesday morning the Third Brigade will
return to camp and Tuesday afternoon an
other brigade, probably the Second, will
take the field. When the Second returns
Wednesday morning the last of the brig
ades, probably the First.- will make a
march. So far arrangements, include ln
detail only .the march of the Third. Brig
ade. The other brigades may take the
same march and they may go elsewhere,
but that they will take some march; ' in
cluding a night encampment,, is certain.
The plan was General Dickinson's, and.it
Â¦was heartily Indorsed by his generals.
While the odd brigade Is on its field
march the others will go through battalion
and regimental maneuvers. The hay that
has blocked a large part of the parade
ground has been sold and before another
day is out It will be hauled away, leaving
the Place clear for any .tactics the regi
ments may wish to study. .Another drill
of the camp will be an attack and a de
fense by attachments assigned to either
side. The countour of the camp ground
and the vicinity offer all kinds of oppor
tunities for this work and there will be a
great deal of it done. In their marches
the brigades will be \ accompanied by

COMPLETES HIS TERRIBLE
CRIMES BY STTXCXD'Ei
Ej>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 16.â It is now cer
tain that the capitalists who are hand
ling negotiations for the Union Pacific-
St. Paul deal look forward to an ulti
mate situation In which all the great
railroads of the Northwest shall be
brought if not into one single corpora
tion, at least into the controlling hands
of a few interests and the possibility of
rate disturbances or traffic diversions
there will be banished forever.
There has been recently a persistent
rumor that one corporation was to be
formed, somewhat on the lines of the
United States Steel Corporation, to take
over control cf the chief railway prop
erties of the Northwest â the Great
Northern and the Northern Pacific
(which now jointly own the Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy). the Chicago and
'Northwestern, the Chicago, Rock Island
end Pacific, the Union Pacific (control
ling the Southern Pacific) and the Chi
cago, Milwaukee and St. Paul.
That the Union Pacific-St. Paul deal I*
a step in the programme no one thinks
cf denying. The "few" referred to
would, of course, Include J. J. Hill, J.
P. Morgan, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., George J.
Oould. the Rockefellers, the Vandernilts
and E.. Ii- Harriman. Indications now
are that all these men are in harmony
on the immediate step in prospectâ the
taking over of the control of the St.
Paui road.
The Vanderbilts" interests are of
course chiefly represented in the Chi
cago and Northwestern, which is believed
to be acting Jointly with the Union Pa
cific In the St. Paul deal. President
Hughltt of the Chicago and Xorthwest
crn and Chairman Miller of the St. Paul
directorate are both in the Union Pacific
directorate.
No Hanger of Dissension.
One fact of foremost significance ?n the
Â¦whole matter is that Mr. Morgan is fully
in touch with the proposed plan. There
is no immediate expectation of his return
from abroad â he has already cancelled
one sailing date which he made; but he
is kept fully advised of what is going
on. And it is so plain that he who runs
may read that the pending negotiations
will not result in any dissensions such
as characterized the Burlington deal.
â¢'My own opinion," said the vice presi
dent of a Western railroad with Chicago
connections to-day, 'is that all the roads
in the Northwest will be ultimately
gathered into the control of a single cor
poration which will ho'd their securi
ties as the steel" trust holds the securi
ties of its subsidiary corporations. I pre
sume it will be modelled after the plan
cf E. H. Harriman's railway securities
company. I do not see how they can
help coming to it.
"That is the only feasible plan for ban
ishing forever all possibility of rate cut
ting and traffic diversjon. They won't
raise rates then, but they will get tit
rates. Traffic will be shipped over any
lireâ they won't care whichâ and the spec
tacle of running freight trains on pas
penger train time tx?cause of competition
will be ended for good. They will get rid
of expensive offices in this city and hun
dreds of drummers employed to drum up
trade all over the country."
Spheres of Influence.
CHICAGO. June Ifi.â The Tribune to
morrow will say: That the Harriman
combine has secured control of the Chi
cago. Milwaukee and St. Paul and that a
composite agreement has been made to
perfect a community of interests among
roads with tracks enough to twice belt
the globe is generally accepted in rail
road circles. The sudden departure of
Mr. Harriman for the East, accompanied
by President John M. Mitchell of the Illi
nois Trust and Savings Bank, was an
nounced in support of the statement that
Mr. Mitchell and other bankers would
furnish the funds for the completion of
the Milwaukee and St. Paul transfer.
The meeting of the "Western officials
with Mr. Harriman is believed to have
been the result of the recent controversy
over the control of Northern Pacific
Btock. which drove short holders to cover
at J1000 a share. A few small roads out
of Chicag-o are not^-partles to the agree
ment, but it is understood that they will
consent to anything that would maintain
rates and end thfi souabble that has been
kept up in the past among the various
"Western lines.
It was asserted to-nigrht that all the
roads west, northwest and southwest
from Chicago to the Pacific Coast will be
controlled in the future by the following
interests:
Lines west of Chicago to the Pacific
Coast, by Harrlmaji, Kuhn, Loeb & Co.
and the Rockefellers.
I/lnes northwest from Chicago, by Hill
and Morgan.
â¢ IJnes southwest from St. Louis, by
Gould and the Rockefellers.
Lines southwest from Chicago, by the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, to which
probably will be added before long the
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific.
Morgan's Dream to Be Realized.
J. P. Morgan and B. H. Harriman. how
ever, will be the real dictators and direct
the policy to be pursued by these com
panies, thus establishing: the "community
of Interests." which has been the dream
of Morgan.
The railroads Interested In the Harrl
jnan consolidation, with their mileag-e, are
as follows:

MANILA, June 16.â Colonels Infant and
Gillvara, representatives* of "General
Cailles, to-day signed the name of their
principal to an .agreement to surrender.'
Under the terms of this agreement Gen
eral Cailles is to assemble' his men at
Santa Cruz, Liguna province,- as quickly
as possible and there surrender himself
and his command to the American author- I
ities. The exact number of his .force is
uncertain, but there probably will be "
more than 500. . .
Seventeen Judges have been appointed
to the courts of first instance. Among
these appointments there ' are eleven
Americans, who have been g-iven the most
important circuits, as follows: Manila,
Kinkaid of Texas and Odlin of New
Hampshire: Aparri, Blount of Georgia:-

Vermont: JJegros. Norris of Nebraska; .
Cebu, Carlock of Illinois: Zamboanpra,
Ickis of Iowa: Jo!o, Whitsett of Missouri.
For more than a year past General
Caillcsh&s commanded the" insurgent
forces operating on the east side. of Bay
Lake, north of Manila. He. is said to be
a French haU-csste, and during the last
revolution ho lias acquired a reimtation
for vindictiveness and cruelty."
Offered Bewards for Heads.
The Society of Mandu-Cats, whose prac- I
tice was to assassinate and bury alive
those of their, countrymen who accepted
American sovereignty whenever the lat
ter fell Into their hands, operated with
the cognizance if not the support of Gen
eral Cailles. At one time Cailles offered a
reward of $10 for each head of an Ameri
can brought to him, and more, recently
he offered a' regard of $10,000 for the head
of Captain Edward N. Jones Jr. of the
Eighth Infantry. ' \ -
Since the capture of Aguinaldo. Cailles.
who was one of the few insurgent leaders
who did not surrender under the terms of
amnesty, has been persistently pursued*
by the American troops. He was de
clared to have been wounded in one en
gagement last month, and negotiations
for his surrender have been going on with
General SumnepÂ»for some weeks past. He
was declared to be an outlaw by the
American authorities, and this fact,
which meant that he could not expect to
enjoy immunity for his past deeds and
violations of honorable warfare, but
would have to s=+and *n nl ori Jt*"Â» ""-"Â¦
charges against him, doubtless compelled
him to prolong his resisiance. .'me mem
bers of the. Federal party advised him to
surrender, but this he persistently refused
to do until he raw that his capture was
Inevitable. ;
Cailles a Good General.
Cailles is a man with considerable influ
ence with the Filipino people and an ag
presslve fighter. He kept his followers
well In hand, his system of mobilization
being excellent. In the mountains of La
guna province, where Cailles practically
confined his operations, he had many ad
vantages over the American troops fre
auently sent to dislodge him,- and ren
dered their efforts futile. He is credited
with the Sinaloan affair of last year, in
which a few American troons were badly
cut up. losing more than 50 per cent of
thÂ«Â» number engaged.
Cailles at one time declared himself to
be Apuinaldo's successor. He and Gen

PITTSBURG, June 16.â Edmund C. Con
verse of the executive board of the United
States Steel Corporation, formerly presi
dent of the National Tube Company, was
arrested at Greensburg Junction, on the
Pennsylvania Railroad, Saturday after
noon at 4 o'clock, taken from the train In
which he. had been touring the country
for several weeks, visiting the plants of
the billion-dollar trust, with a large party
of officials and arraigned at Greensburg.
where he was compelled to give ball for
his appearance the first Monday in Sep
â¢ tember.
Converse was arrested on a writ Issued
by the Westmoreland Court at the in
stance of James"!,. Devenny of McKees
port, charging him with misappropriating
the proceeds of 'the sale of 3999 shares in
the capital stock of the McKeesport, Du
quesne and Wilmerding Street Railway
Company. Devenny held the majority of
tiie stock In the road and several hun
dred shares In trust.- He alleges, that in
February, 1836, Converse secured the stock
from him, sold it for about $100,000 and
failed to account for the receipts. Devenny
says he has made repeated demands for
his share of the money and that Converse
has failed to respond.
Last January Mr. Devenny began equity
proceedings against the steel magnate,
but Converse has kept himself outside the
Jurisdiction of the Allegheny county
courts. On Saturday, when he passed
through McKeesport, Devenny saw him
and started after him. Converse got out
of the city and over the line into West
moreland County before Devenny could
serve a writ onTiim. Devenny, knowing
that Converse's special car would have to
go through Greensburg to reach the main
line of the Pennsylvania, took a short cut
to that town. He secured attorneys, and
when Mr. Converse's train arrived at the
Junction Mr. -Devenny was awaiting him
-with the Sheriff of Westmoreland County
and Constable Collins of McKeesport.
The special train was not supposed to
stop at the Junction, but was flagged by
order of the Sheriff. The party boarded
the train and Mr. Converse, much to hla
surprise, was placed under arrest. He
went with the party to the office of De
venny's attorneys in Greensburg and fur
nished bail for his appearance In the
Westmoreland Court on .September 2.
The party traveling on the special train
was composed of about twenty-five of the
officials of the United States Steel Cor

COVELO, June 16.â The police and town
marshal and their deputies In this com
munity are proverbially brave, but the
mettle of three of them -was sorely tried
to-day by a struggle with a ferocious ba
boon. It was while attempting to arrest
an itinerant gypsy queen at the parade
grounds that Marshal Keating was at
tacked, by a muscular simian, belonging to
the Romany potentate. The animal loy
ally came to the aid of his mistress and
gave valiant battle to the officers In the
presence of a large crowd of cowboys,
who loosened Its hold on Heating only
when the tightening grasp of four las
soes shut off its wind.
The creature was, however, subdued,
but momentarily and after being thrust
Into a wagon he renewed hostilities and
proceeded to clean out the whole squad of
officers that followed him during- the me
lee. The huge gorilla was laid low with
a club and bound with straps. The queen
and her daughter were then taken aboard
and the journey to the calaboose began.
On the way the gorilla freed his arms and
made a vicious lunge at the driver. Walter
Osborne.
The gypsy woman, with her little daugh
ter and her gorilla, has for several days
been traveling through this section and

were killed and much farm property waa
destroyed by a tornado that struck at a
point thirty milea from this city last
night and swept for a considerable dis
tance through the southeast corner of the
county. Three inches of rain fell.
The injured are: Mr. McCormack. wife
and \hree children; Mr. Gardner and
wife and three unknown persons.
The storm was preceded by a heavy
downpour of rain and dense darkness. A
balloon-shaped cloud suddenly formed,
and in an instant the McCormack house,
with the entire family, was picked up
and carried several yards. The house
was smashed into kindling: and the fam
ily thrown against a barbed wire fence.
AH were fearfully cut and mangled. Mrs.
McCormack and her 7-year-old son were
most severely hurt. The child cannot live
and the mother is in a critical condition.
McCormack's collarbone was broken and
he was badly cut about the head, while
his two daughters sustained Internal in

Physicians give little hope of saving
more than two of the five injured at the
McCormack home. Besides the loss of
the dwelling and all its contents, all the

to-rpoOMALES, June 16.â The beautiful
II * new Church of the Assumption
I was dedicated to-day with full
Jl and Impressive t ceremony by
Archbishop Riordan. Solemn pro
cessions of priests between ranks of de
vout worshipers with bowed heads, swing
ing censors and the solemn blessing of
walls and altars brought into this prosaic
little town of the Marln County hills a
touch of romantic mediaevallsm that filled
the hearts -of simple and devout parish
loners with religious fervor. The dairy
men and* ranchers and hardy fishermen,
who are the bone and sinew of the par
ish, were transported to things spiritual
by stately ceremonies that once were
held at Jerusalem and by rites whose ori
gin marks the beginning of Christianity
and whose elaboration was the pomp and
splendor of Christian Rome.
From San Francisco to Cazadero every
town on the line of the North Pacific
Coast Railroad . contributed its quota of
visitors to witness the dedication. Many
arrived yesterday and tralnloads came in
this morning. From the valleys to north
and east and south Catholics swarmed
into Tomales . until every street was
fringed with conveyances. Well-to-do
ranchers and dclrymen from Chileno Val
ley, farmers from Valley Ford and Bloom
field and fisher folk from Marshalls came
into town by their most pretentious con
veyances and mingled with the throng
pressing toward the new church, which
nestled resplendent in fresh-hewn stone
on the sloping hillside, beautiful and built
to withstand the ravages of time and yet
still locking. the setting in grounds and
environment to . make it seem a part of
the landâ an established factor in the life
of the people. -
Thc Rev. John Rogers, pastor, of the
parish, whose energy and zeal and execu
tive ability are largely responsible for
giving California this, its most beautiful
Catholic church, was ! busy from early
morning with preparations for the cere
mony. Two other new churches . in the
same parish, . Inllt within two years, are
accredited to him, and dedications are his
recreation.
The ceremony in which we take part to-day
Is suggestive of many thoughts. Why are we
here? What purpose brings us together? Any
body an tell that we are assisting at the
opening 1 of a new and beautiful Catholic house
of worship.- This explanation is simple enough
After the gospel, the Rev. ' James Mc-
Donald of St. Charles Borromeo delivered
the sermon. He said In oart:
Father McDonald's Sermon.
The priests having returned to the sanc
tuary, solemn high mass, the first for the
new edifice, was celebrated. The Rev.
Father Valentinl was celebrant, the Rev.
James Grant deacon and the Rev. M.
Mackey sub-deacon.
The Rev. Philip O'Ryan was master of
ceremonies throughout the dedication.
After the arrival of the train from San
Francisco, Â¦ shortly after 12 o'clock, the
solemn procession formed in the sacristy
and moved slowly down the aisle and- out
at the front entrance. The Rev. M.
Mackey, assistant pastor of the parish,
bore the crucifix, and in the nrocesslon
there were, besides Archbishop Riordan,
the following priests: The Rev. Hugh
Lagan of Sacred Heart parish, the Rev.
P. Scanlon of St. Joseph's - Church, the
Rev. M. D. Connolly of St. Paul's, the
Rev. James McDonald of St. Charles', the
Rev.. John Nugent of St. Brendan's, the
Rev. James Grant of St. Brieid's and the
Rev. Philip O'Ryan of the Cathedral, all
of San Francisco: the Rev. Father Val
entine of Sausalito, the Rev. T. Phillips
of San Rafael, the Rev. James Cleary of
Petaluma and the Rev. John- Rogers. .
The procession moved to the accom
paniment of the recital. of prayers, and
after it had passed out at the arched en
trance the solemn religious pageant
marched slowly around, the church, the
priests reciting the Psalms and the arch
bishop sprinkling the walls with holy
water.
Upon the return of the procession to the
main entrance the archbishop recited the
prayers of the ritual, and the surpliced
priests moved up the aisle to the altar,
where the litanies were' recited. : ; Again
passing out through the sanctuary gates

holy water in blessing upon the side altars

A far more startling possibility of war
fare of the future is suggested, and it
may rot be an idle dream. Mr. Clarke
rave the rime will come when by pushing
a. key and releasing powerful electric
Â¦waves from a wireless telegraph trans
mitter the mapazice of an enemy's ship
can bt successfully exploded at sea.
It was an Ingenious combination of the
.possibilities of wireless telegraph with
thoss of the Hummell telediagraph, or
picture telegraphing machine, which re
sulted in the marvelous joint application
of the two devices witnessed in the Her
ald bulldlrg yesterday.
IV. J. Clark, general manager of the
"L'nited States Electrical Supply Company,
assisted by the Herald electricians arid
telegraphers, conducted the experiments
r.o a successful issue. In addition to his
exposition of the utility of wireless teiÂ»7
raphy in the transmission of pictures, Mr.
Clarke also demonstrated the feasibility
of employing wireless telegraphy in the
starting and stopping of trolley cars, the
lighting and extinguishing of Incandes
cent lamps from a distance and in the
discharge of artillery by firing guns from
a point remote from their actual location.
A miniature model of a trolley car run
ning on a circular track was controlled
without connecting wire as completely as
though the operator had a string tied to
it. instead of merely standing fifteen feet
away, as he did, and flashing a spark by
means of pushing a key with his thumb.
The circuit of the car was connected with
a mechanical motor so that when the mo
tor closed this circuit in response to elec
tric waves generated from the transmitter.
Â«md the car started briskly around the
track. When the motor opened the circuit
In response to a second impulse of the
transmitter the car promptly stopped.
Electric incandescent lamps were next
lighted or extinguished at 100 by pressing
the key of a portable transmitter.
Then came the marvels of wireless
telerraphy and the rapid strides made In
:ts development, culminating in wireless
reports of the international yacht races
sent ty frlgnor Marconi from a point at
s=ea to the Herald, thence to The Call
business efflce on Market street, with but
one r^lay, viz., the relay in The Call's
New York office In the Herald building.
Combination of Systems. â¢ '
It is little more than two years ago that
the public read almost incredulously of
the marvels achieved by the Herald in
telegraphing pictures simultaneously to
Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and St.
Louis. Portraits of Parkhurst and Croker
flashed along the same wire a thousand
miles or more in company without burn-
Ing the wire or tearing off the insulators.
A picture of the first gun fired at Manila
was ticked across the country for simul
taneous publication in four great cities
and back to the Herald from those cities
came pictures that were published
promptly in JCew York.
These modern miracles were brought by
the aid of an instrument much like a
phonograph in size and appearance, which
its inventor, E. A. Hummell of St. Paul.
called a telediagraph. Its mechanism and
method of operation were fully described
at the time. Since then It has been prac
tically utilized for transmitting to Bos
ton Illustrations of international yacht
races and on many other occasions of gen
eral interest, but the possibility of util
izing it except in connection with a. regu
lar telegraphic wire circuit had not yet
been demonstrated, and, indeed, was
hardly conceived.
Marvels in Telegraphy.
All this can be done, for the Herald has
demonstrated it in a series of experi
ments, concluded yesterday, whereby it
has successfully applied the principles of
wireless telegraphy to accurate transmis
sion from point to point of portraits,
sketches, maps and other pictures.
Portraits were yesterday transmitted
from a room situated in a distant part of
the Herald buldlng through space and
thence through a brick wall to the re
ceiving instrument situated in a room of
the Herald building, which The Call oc
cupies as its office. In the practical appli
cation of wireless telegraphy to the con
veyance of intelligence the Herald and
The Call have been pioneers in America
ever since they utilized Signor Marconi's
Fervices in reporting tne international
yacht races two years agt>. 'With the re
cent announcement of the Herald's pur
pose to revolutionize maritime news-gath
ering by the establishment of a wireless
telegraph reporting station on board the
Nantucket Shoals lightship, some forty
miles out at sea. interest in the fascina
ting subject has been renewed and further
research into its possibilities and limita
tions has been stimulated.

GUARDS at some of the county jails are pro
testing against the action of the police com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors in de
clining to sign demands for fresh fruit for their use,
and I. P. Kincaid, commissary for the jails, in sup
porting the protest has written to the board a com
munication, in which he says:
Some people might consider that fruit Is a luxury,
but I am of the opinion that in California it is not
classed in that category, as it may be seen on the tables
of the commonest boarding-houses practically during
the whole year, and I therefore see no reason why the
guards should not have it.
Whether or not the guards should be furnished
with fresh fruit is a matter upon which The Call has
no opinion to express. It cannot undertake to draw
up a menu for county institutions of any kind. Upon
the general question, however, whether in California
fruit is to be regarded as a luxury or as a staple food,
The Call has a decided opinion. Mr. Kincaid is
right Fruit in this State is so abundant and any
one who has lived here for any length of time has
become so much accustomed to it in one form or
another at meals, that it can no longer be "regarded
as a luxury. It is a part of tbe ordinary food of the
California people. The conception of it as a luxury
is a survival of ideas brought from the East or from
Europe, where fruit v is for the* rich alone.
Not only is fruit a staple food with us, but in this
climate it might be fairly called a necessary of life.
We are within the temperate zone, but there is a tinge,
of the tropics in our climate. Were it not so we
FRUIT AS FOOD.
PERSONAL MENTION.
It is stated that Conger has decided that he would
rather go back to China than to take chances of get
ting the Republican nomination for Governor of
Iowa; so it would seem the story about the yearn
ing for Conger among the politicians of Iowa must
have been exaggerated.
The decree is not a foolish one. The custom of
our courts require that any person taking an oath'
shall kiss a Bible, but there are few who actually kiss
it. The ceremony is the survival of an old ritual
which has long since lost its significance. By and by
it will be eliminated from court proceedings; and so
by and by the kissing of the royal hand will be elim
inated from the customs of the court of St. James.
King Edward evidently ha*s a good fund of sound
senseinhis head and it would probably be well for
his empire if he were allowed a larger liberty of
using it. .
With a similar display of common sense and disre
gard for old conventions he has given orders that
hereafter at royal receptions the ancient practice of
kissing the royal hand shall be made a mere matter
of form. His hand is not to be kissed. The gentle
man presented is to go through the form in due de
corum. He is to take the royal hand and bend over it;
but if there be any kissing, the kiss is to be placed on
the thumb of the kisser, and not on the royal hand.
The late Henry Grady of Georgia died in his youth
and all the promise of his genius and his patriotism
was lost to his country simply because he attended a
Plymouth Rock celebration in Massachusetts on a
cold, windy day and followed the custom of taking
off his hat and standing with bare head during a por
tion of the celebration ceremonies. From that use
less exposure he caught cold, which turned into pneu
monia, and he died. That is but one of the many
deaths that have resulted from the practice which men
have of taking off their hats on any solemn occasion
in the open air. King. Edward cannot prevent his
people from taking off thetr hats at certain times upon
the celebration of the royal birthday, but he can and
has prevented that celebration from taking place at
a season when the practice might entail serious illness,
if not death. , a.
One of these common-sense reforms was his decree
that the royal birthday shall be celebrated on the
anniversary of the birth of the late Queen, the 24th
of May, instead of on the actual anniversary of his
birth, which occurred in November. It may seem
to the unreflecting to be a little thing to hold a holi
day in May instead of in the cold month of November,
but thoughtful men will take a different view of it.
It is not always safe to attend open air festivals in
the bleak months of the year, as something more
than temporary discomforts may result. .
KING EDWARD ( of England has not been able
to mark his accession to the throne by any
t acts so startling as those by which Kaiser Wil
liam began his imperial career. He has not had the
power to Hrop Salisbury as Bismarck was dropped,
or to adopt a foreign and a domestic policy radically
different from that which prevailed under the former
sovereign. Being a constitutional ruler Edward has
had to confine his reforms to narrow limits. Most
of them indeed appear so small and trifling as to pro
voke a smile at first thought, but they are not with
out value and will doubtless prove beneficial to his
people. \
KING EDWARD'S REFORMS.
BETTER weather and brilliant crop conditions
caused a further improvement in both whole
sale and distributive trade last week. The bank
clearings showed a gain over the corresponding week
in 1900 of 66.3 per cent, the gain being especially
marked among the ten or dozen largest cities. This
was especially the case in New York, which exhibited
an increase of 95 per cent, which is particularly sig
nificant in view of the comparative quietness of the
stock market. Philadelphia, a most conservative
city, where trade is supposed to be legitimate if it
is anywhere, showed a gain of 90.6 per cent. These
figures indicate that the gain in these clearings is due
to an actual increase in consumptive trade, and not
to speculation. The failures throughout the country
were 188. against 180 for the same week last year.
The staples as a rule are showing a much better
movement than a month ago. More demand is re
ported for some kinds of woolens, and some of the
cheaper grades are heavily ordered ahead. Shoe
shipments from New England centers continue unus
ually large, in spite of the fact that the factories are
about through with their summer orders. These
shipments are now.ii8,ooo cases ahead of the same
time last year. The Western leather markets are
quoted firm, while hides have lately been tending up
ward. The wholesale dry goods trade is also report
ing an improvement in the distribution. But the iron
and steel trade continues to lead all others, and it is
remarkable how long the abnormal activity in this
industry keeps up. Pig iron is being heavily bought
by the great steel combine, while finished products
are quoted in enlarged demand. Wire goods, hard
ware and farming implements are in active request,
and manufacturers of wire goods are behind in their
orders. Railroads report large earnings and the gen
eral commerce of the country' is in as good condition
as at any time during the past two or three years, as
far as surface indications go.
Wall street is still lamenting the absence of the
dear public, which got its fingers so badly burned
during the recent railroad excitement. Conditions
there are rather tempting to the public, as the money
market is easy, and the fine crop prospects point to
large railroad earnings during the coming fall. The
situation is rather bullish than otherwise, and the
shorts are covering, but the public still holds off.
There is no selling pressure, and heavy operators are
inclined to hold their stocks, in view of the good
outlook just mentioned.
Our local conditions show no change worthy of
note. The different strikes, which were expected to
cause a falling off in trade, have not thus far done
so to any appreciable extent
The (ttmntry, on which most of the business of the
city is based, is looking well. The harvests are now
under way and are turning out well as a rule, while
prices for orchard and field products are well up to
the average at this time of the year. The foreign
trade of the coast continues of large volume, money
is plentiful, collections are as good as they ever are,
and there are no important failures to disturb the
outlook. If the last half of 1901 makes as good a
showing as the first half, the year will close with
as satisfactory a record as any of its immediate prede
cessors. .
It is somewhat surprising to learn that a former lieu
tenant in Roosevelt's Rough Riders has been arrested
in Kansas upon a charge of defrauding an Indian. If
he had been accused of making a hold-up with a rifle
the offense v.-ould not have seemed strange, but one
does not expect the border boys to work confidence
games.
LAST "WEEK'S BUSINESS.
San Francisco can look with pride upon the rapid
rise in the Philippines of her native son, James F.
Smith. First a colonel, then a brigadier general,
then Collector of Customs at Manila, and now Justice
of the Supreme Court of the islands. ; Funston of
Kansas has done well, but he is a long way behind
Smith.
The date of holding the primaries is not so far
off but every good citizen should begin to give
attention to the duties imposed upon him by his citi
zenship. When all the faults of the bosses have been
enumerated, the fact remains that the chief weakness
and defect of municipal government in America has
been the neglect of municipal politics by the better
elements of the people. In times past there has been
some excuse for the neglect, since honest men have
had but little chance of electing delegates in a boss
ruled primary. Now, however, the law gives all a
fair showing. It remains with the citizens to maintain
the law, and to make use of it. Let us hope the duty
and the opportunity will be neither overlooked nor
ignored.
It is to be borne in mind the league has been or
ganized mainly for the purpose of interesting Repub
licans in primary elections and thereby enabling the
party to profit by the primary election law. It goes
without saying the law cannot enforce itself, and un
less the better elements of the party attend the pri
maries the bosses will elect delegates enough to con
trol the nominating convention. The league has no
candidates of its own, nor does it favor those of any
faction. It seeks the support of all good Republicans,
but promises to none any benefit other than what all
will gain from the conduct of honest elections at
which every Republican will have an equal voice in
the selection of delegates from his district.
PREPARE FOR THE PRIMARIES.
xâ> ONSIDERABLE gratification will be felt by
I all good citizens in the report that the organ
-^ ization of the Republican Primary League has
already promoted activity among the people in pre
paring for the coming primaries. Voters who believe
in honest politics and are opposed to boss rule have
been aroused to the importance of the issue, and dis
trict clubs are being organized for the purpose of
bringing out the rank and file of the party at the
elections, so that the delegates chosen will be rep
resentative of genuine Republicanism, and not the
tools of a boss who calls himself a Republican solely
for political effect.
One dispatch from Paris says the recent grand re
ception of the Castellanes was attended by but 350
guests, "all of them of the highest aristocracy"; .but
another says there were 2000 present and Eulalie pf
Spain was the only distinguished guest. Evidently
the Castellanes should keep a press bureau and send
out corrected returns.
\ Second â A curious but- very significant
fact is disclosed by the fiction of the dif
ferent countries, although unconsciously,
to its authors. The fiction, whether In
prose or poetry, of the countries to the
south of Europe is ijuite apt to end un
happily. From the time of the great
dramas of Greece and Rome through the
time of the awful tragedy of Dante's
"Inferno** down to our own the fiction of
southern countries is tragic. On the other
hand, the fiction of peoples of Anglo-Sax
on descent ends happily. The latter re
gard a tragic representation of ordinary
human life as something unusual and un
natural, and as an affront to a benevolent
Providence. Yet even in England, or Ger
many or France the story often turns on
the difficulties of poor -lovers who cannot
marry because of want of property which
will enable them to support themselves
and their families In married life. The
interest of the story turns on the difficulty
of the hero or the heroine to find a sup
port, and in the end a rich relative, or
some half a dozen relatives who stand
between the hero or the heroine and a
title or an estate, die off, or some wealthy
relative comes out of the clouds and they
marry and live happy ever after. The
same thing is found in many English me
moirs.- Tennyson's marriage was delayed
for years because he could not afford to
marry. Now/ in this country if there
were a pair of lovers found in fiction or
In real life who had health and strength
who could not get married if one had a
sixpence and the other a shilling, the
thing would be regarded as an absurdity
In fiction and a disgrace to the parties
if It were to happen in reality.
Boys Who Seek New Careers.
Take another quite obvious considera
tion. The condition of the farmer all over
the country fifty or one hundred years ago
waa considered one of the most enviable
which the law of humanity would admit.
The farmer and the farmer's â¢wife and the
farmer's boys worked from dawn to even
ing twilight summer and winter. They
had many privations. They practiced
strict economy. They had plenty to eat.
a shelter and good fires, a freeman's share
In the Government, a healthful and happy
life. Yet that life, then regarded as the
most fortunate on the face of the earth,
does not content the farmer's boy to-day.
If you go through any Northern State, or
any "Western State more than fifty years
old. and as you pass the older dwellings
ask what has become of the sons of the
men who had dwelt on those lands for
generations, you will Una the boys are
gone to take plac'e3 in the professions,
in manufacturing, in the management of
great railroads or great commercial es
tablishments, or in public life.
We are reminded of the great mass of
misery and of poverty that exists, espe
cially in our large cities. But we ought to
inquire what would be the condition of
the same people in any other country or
in any preceding generation. Much of this
distress is among our foreign population.
Yet Â¦would many of the Irish consent to
go back to Ireland? Or the Swedes to go
back to Sweden and take the places held
by their grandparents at home? Would
the negro go back to slavery again?
Would he go back to Africa again?
The great educational institutions, and tbe
application of the sciences to practical
life, to which last large numbers of our
American youth owe the opportunity for
honorable and useful, lives, and the chance
in many cases of acquiring vast fortunes,
are all the creations of one or two genera
tions. There are great professions, cm
ploying immense numbers of active and
well-paid servants, which were unknown
when I was born. The number of com
mercial travelers in this country was esti
mated thirty years ago to exceed 100.000.
I suppose it is many times that number
now. The number of skilled electricians
must be nearly or quite as laiyre. The
railroads support more than five million
persons. The polytechnic institutions in
the country, and the other mercantile and
scientific schools, with their vast number
of pupils. I believe without an exception,
are younger than the Lawrence Scientific
school at Harvard, which was founded by
Abbott Lawrence about 1846 or '47. .. '
Condition of the Wage-Workers.
Labor in its lowest form now gets a
compensation, whether measured* by the
amount or the purchasing power of the
wages, largely in excess of any other
country, or of any ether previous genera
tion here. In 1344, when I was about 13
years old. the Fitcburg Railroad was in
process of construction. It was built by
Irishmen who had come lately to the
country, who got GO cents a day for a
hard day's work with the shovel. They
worked from. early dawn to late at night,
I suppose at least fourteen hours a day,
for a great part of the year. What able
bodied man now will work ten hours a
day for five days of the week, and half
that time on Saturday, for 60 cents a day?
Yet the 60 cents will go a good deal fur
ther now than it would in 1844. ,
I suppose every manufacturing' commu
nity In the country contains hundreds of
men, skilled workmen, capable manufac
turers, who came to this country from
England, or Scotland, or Sweden, or Nor
way, or Germany, wherfc they were glad
to get as skilled laborers a wage of $5 or
?6 a week, who In a very short time after
they got here received $2 or $3 a day, and
then became foremen, then agents, and
then got large establishments of their
own In which were employed hundreds of
workmen, every one of whom receives
three or four times what the employer
had received in his own country.
How Woman's Position-Has Improved
Now, take the improvement in the con
: dltion of women.. When I was born the
married woman had no property
she could call her own and no
rights against her husband, ex
cept that he was bound to sup
port her and she was exempt, if the
law was enforced, from cruel personal vio
lence. The husband, according to the law,
might correct her with a rod no bigger
than his thumb. All her personal prop
erty became absolutely his upon marriage
and* her real estate became his for life.
On the other hand, if she survied him,
she had no right whatever in his property,
except that if he invested it in real estate
which was improved, but not including
woodland, she had the rents and profits
of one-third of It for her life. Everything
else he could take away from her by con
veyance in his lifetime, or by will. In
stances were known of men who have
married women with large fortunes, lived
on their wives' fortunes all their days,
and then by. will left to the wife a small
and insufficient pittance to be enjoyed "so
long as she remains my widow." On the
< other, hand the woman could not make a
will ?.t all. Her personal services and
earnings were the absolute property of
her husband. She had no right or control
in the children. Their education was ab
solutely controlled bv the ' father, anil
Firstâ The steady and unchecked tide of
immigration which comes to our shores is
the strongest possible testimony to the
advantage enjoyed here. The reason of
men and women is a guide at least as
unerring as the instinct of birds. They
know where they are best off. As in the
old fable of the "Lion's Den," although
for a far different reason, the footsteps
are all one way. It Is believed that the
United States is the only country on earth
which has had to make laws to repress
or check the tide_ of immigration.
I have been csked to say something- as
to the opportunity of an American young
man and woman in our day, as compared
with that of the youth of other countries,
or of former times. To deal with this
subject adequately would demand a good
deal of thought and an examination of
statistics. But there' are a few consider
ations which may be worth stating which
occur to one at once when the subject is
considered. Most of them are quite com
monplace. But they may have some value
if they are grouped together.
COPYRIGHT, 1901.
their services as well as hers were as ab
solutely his property as that of a slave.
Now, compare this condition, which is
still the condition of woman in many
countries calling themselves civilized,
with that of the American wife of to-day.
It is not unusual at this moment on the
Continent of Europe to see women yoked
to the same cart with large dogs, â¢ and
sometimes with heifers and steers, draw
ing heavy loads, or working in the field
with shovel or hoe. She is often practi
cally nothing but a beast of burden still.
The American wife and the American
mother, as a general rule, is the most ex
alted being on the face of the earth. The
law protects her in her personal-property
and civil rights. But she finds a better
and surer protection than the law in the
chivalrous worship of son and father and
husband and brother.
The Rich and Their Fortunes.
Prophets of ill are plenty now, as al
ways; not, I think, so plenty now as for
merly. They tell us of the vast fortunes
that are accumulated in the hands of
single men. The millionaire rides in his
palace car while the poor man walks in
the heat of the summer sun or faces the
storm of winter. I admit that these great
fortunes are in some respects a great dan
ger. When the millionaire undertakes to
purchase political power of office he com
mits the most dangerous crime to the
safety of the republic. He deprives pub
lic office of what should be its chief re
ward; he deprives government of its pur
ity; he is a danger to the republic itself.
But these great fortunes are not an un
mixed evil. They are not made commonly
at the expense of poorer men.
For every million that the rich
man makes poorer men will, in
large numbers make their millions also
by other enterprises and employments
which but for him would not exist at all.
Leland Stanford and his associates made
their millions building a railroad across
ths continent. But the building of the
railroad and the railroad when it waa
built enriched hundreds of thousands of
men and created the prosperity of large
States, which without what these men
did never would have existed at all. And
under cur institutions where the prop
erty is divided among all the children and
cannot be tied up very well in a single
generation, these great fortunes are dis
tributed as rapidly as they are made.
"Where Bo the Fortunes Go?
In a " vast number of Instances these
great accumulations are in but another
form of socialism. The man who gets it
cannot take it away with him when he
dif-s. He gives it to the public by the en
dowment of colleges and schools and uni
versities and museums and libraries and
hospitals and parks. He does voluntarily
what the socialist wants to do by law.
But if it were done by law. as the so
cialist wants it to be done, all individual
enterprise and stimulation to energy or
invention or thrift would be lacking. What
has become of a large part of the wealth
of Mr. Rockefeller? What has become of
the wealth of Leland Stanford? "What has
become of the wealth of Mr. Hearst? And
what is to become of the wealth of Mr.
Carnegie? In my own city there have
been two vast fortunes made â¢within the
last few years. The owner of one of them
died the other day. leaving the whole of
it to a university. The owner of the other
still lives, now having reached mature
life without wife or children or near kin
dred. He has held his vast fortune as a
trustee for his fellow citizens, managing
it for them without pay with an ability
and a public spirit which no hired man
agers or no public officials could furnish.
Do not be in a. hurry, my socialistic
friend. If this thing goes on for another
generation the poor man in his right of
citizenship will confront the rich man,
himself the richer of the two.
,Now what are the qualities which bring
success to the individual youth? The first
and great essential to success is charac
ter. Honesty is better than genius for the
man who desires to get on even in this
world. Integrity multiplies by ten every
other capacity of man. The world almost
always attributes to the honest man of
ability an intellectual ability which it
would not ascribe to him without it. The
man who decides to do what is right in
every emergency, what is right and hon
est, acts, according to the universal ex
perience of mankind, wisely as well as
righteously. So, he forms a habit of right
judgment in great emergencies which
saves him not only from doing what is
morally wrong, but from mistakes if he
look merely at hi3 worldly interest. I re
peat, integrity multiplies every capacity
of the human intellect by ten.
Using 1 the Spare Moments.
I have in my time known many famous
in war, in statesmanship, in science, in
the professions and in business. If I were
asked to declare the secret of their suc
cess I should attribute it in general not
to any superiority of natural genius, but
to the use they made in youth, after the
ordinary day's work was over, of the
hours which other men throw away or
devote to idleness or rest, or society. There
areMoubtless many dull men, there are
doubtless men of rare and brilliant genius.
But the great things that have been done
in this world have not in general been
done by men of rare genius, and dull men
who have done their best have contributed
very largely to what has been done for
mankind. The great things in this world
have been done by men of ordinary nat
ural capacity, who have done their best.
They have done their best by never wast
ing their time. It has been said that the
great fortunes in this country have been
accumulated not by men with a genius for
making money, but with a genius for
money-keeping; that it is not the size of
the brook, but the strength and tightness
of the dam which -makes the great pond
That is as true of the result of a life's
work in getting honor or power or fame
or in storing mental capacity or doing pub
lic service as it is In money-getting If
half the hours of your day run to waste
there will be but half as much to show
for your life when it is over. I cannot
overstate this matter. "It is what we
sow," says the great preacher of the Eng
lish church, Jeremy Taylor. "It is what
we sow in the minutes and spare portions
of a few years that grow3 up to crowns
and scepters."

xort.. entertainment and health. Its splendid
caie waa a wonder, the nshiHg unexcelled.
v Of course it is disappointing that the Chinese ques
tion is not to be taken up, for it is one which ought
to be passed upon by just such an international body;
but too much should not be expected at first. The
court has been created and public sentiment in every
civilized country is working in its favor. Moreover
the enormous burdens. of taxation rendered necessary
by the military and naval armaments of the nations
tend to hasten the coming of the time when the court
will be useful in great as well as in little issues. At
the present time there would be no way of enforcing
the decisions of the court upon a great nation. Even
in this hemisphere we are witnessing the ease with
which a small nation like Chile can stop a plan for
pan-American arbitration simply by refusing to sub
mit to it.
While the early activities of the High Court are
thus disappointing, there is still something of en
couragement in the very fact that it has been created.
The Berlin authority is quoted as saying, "The Hague
agreement is something like the Magna Charter, a
convention around which future international law will
crystallize." It is stated thafthe German Emperor
and his Government are now more favorably inclined
to the court than ever before, and other governments
are believed to be similarly disposed.
It appears that despite its high sounding name and
the majesty of the powers it represents, the High
Court of Nations, as it is generally called, is begin
ning modestly. It evidently believes' in the day of
small things to start with. It would be interesting to
know what international questions it has under con
sideration, but no information on that point was
given. With the great issues of the time ignored, it
is safe to suppose the dignitaries of the court are
wrangling over some such mighty problem as that
involved in the question whether, jt be permissible in
war for an invader to burn a barn. There are some
men who see no objection whatever to the destruction
of the independence of a state, but who would be
greatly grieved if in the course of the destruction a
farm building were burned and a cow slaughtered.
THE HAGUE COURT.
BERLIN dispatches announce that a member of
the "International Court ... of Arbitration"
agreed upon at The Hague peace conference
and appointed by the great powers of the world has
stated in a recent interview that all of the fifty-five
representatives of the nations have been duly ap
pointed, that the court has been organized and that
several international questions are already before it.
He is reported to have added, however, * that the
Transvaal question- is not one within the scope of the
court, since the peace conference decided that the
Boer states were not sovereign; and furthermore that
the Chinese indemnity question is not among those
the court is considering.

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
Prepared by Experts and Specialists for
Three large armored cruisers are^ about
to be built for the French navy. A com
parison between this class ot vessels built
or building in France, Great Britain and
the United States is shown In the ap
pended table:
The British Admiralty Is seriously con
sidering antidotes to submarines, the
problem of which has been narrowed
down to three methods. The first 13 to
fire shells filled- with high explosives,
which, bursting in the water near the
boat, will beat it In. The second plan
Is to utilize the old plan of spar torpe
does, and the third Is by deliberate un
der-water attack. The success of the first
method depends upon accuracy of gun
nery and the certainty that ,the shell will
burst at just the right moment. The sec
ond means proposed presupposes that
there will be several boats armed with
spar torpedoes awaiting the appearance
of the submarine on the surface, in which
event the latter's annihilation Is pretty
certain. The third method simply means
a fight under water between the attack
ing and defending submarines.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Iwate, Japanese armored cruiser of
95C6 tons,, arrived at Yokosuko on May 17
from England. She Is the last of six
armored cruisers built in Europe during
the past six years for the navy of Japan.
The ship was built by the Armstrong
firm at Elswick, her keel was laid July 1?.
1S38, launched March 29, 1900. and com
pleted March IS last. The period of con
struction (92S days>. while not a record
breaker in shipbuilding, is much better
than that of the New York and Brooklyn
of the United States navy, which took
1436 and 21S1 days, respectively, between
laying of keel and placing the ships in
commission.
Russia has ordered the construction of
four high speed cruisers of the Bogatyr
type, an improvement on the Variasr.
They will be built at Russian yards,
namely, at Wlndan. Liban. Nikalieff and
Sebastopol. Their tonnage displacement
is 6750 tons, with 20.000 horsepower and
twenty-three knots speed. The plans anrt
many of the patterns have been furnished
from the German yard at which the
Bogatyr was built.^

The cost of the new royal yacht Victo
ria and Albert Is likely to exceed double
the original estimate, which was J1.763.1S5.
A second revised estimate, made one year
ago. raised tb.3 sum to J2.560.170. and va
rious additional improvements recom
mended by the civilian expert to make
the yacht seaworthy have been In pro
gress since the revised estimate was
made.
Three officers of a Russian volunteer
fleet steamer, who were recently arrested
while in the act of drawing a map of
Nagasaki harbor, have been sentenced to
six months' severe imprisonment by a
Japanese court. As the three ofllcers left
the country while the case was pending
the sentence Is inoperative unless they
should venture to return to Japan.
The British battleship Bulwark has
made its thirty hours' coal consumption
trial under four-fifths power with these
results: Horsepower, 11,753; steam In boil
ers, 257 pounds; revolutions, 101; speed.
1S.8 knots; coal consumption. 1.3 pounds

The Nembo, one four thirty-knot de
stroyers building at Naples, has Just been
launched. The vessel is of 350 tons dis
placement, with eighty tons coal. 60W
horsepower and will have a battery of one
twelve-pounder and five slx-pounders.

could not profitably grow, so many subtropical fruits.
Our people therefore require something of a fruit
diet almost as imperatively* as do the people of the
tropics. The use of it is healthful and beneficial and
saves many a doctor's bill. It may not be advisable
to furnish it to the guards of the jails, but if so the
rejection of it from the list of food supplies should
be put upon some other ground than that of its be
ing a luxury. That objection cannot be urged suc
cessfully in any part of California.
PRESIDENT CROWLEY of the Youths' Di
rectory has formulated a plan for training boys
in farm work and fitting them for obtaining in
manhood an independence by the cultivation of the
soil instead of joining the ranks of wage earners in
the city. The plan of course is not a new one.. Many
a time has the philanthropy of the world sought to
save youth from the dangers and competitions of city
life by carrying them back to the land. That, how
ever, is no objection to the plan. It is on the other
hand a proof of its merit, for it is an assurance that
it is based upon conservative wisdom drawn from the
experience of the world in matters of that kind.
Of course the plan proposed by President Crowley
is not exactly like any other. That was not to be ex
pected nor desired. Every earnest and original
teacher has his own way of working out the prob
lems of education, and such a teacher is he. whose
work in the Youths' Directory has achieved so much
of benefit, not only for the boys who have been
under his instruction but for the community at large.
We have then a plan submitted to the consideration
of our people of means which merits their support.
It is not a fantastic plan, nor is it proposed by a
theoretical reformer, or visionary philanthropist It is
a practical, common-sense measure, and if supported
by adequate donations is to be carried out under the
supervision of men who have had experience in teach
ing and managing boys, and whose work already
accomplished attests their fitness for the new work
they purpose to undertake.
To carry out the plan there is needed something like
300 acres of fertile farm land and an endowment of
about $75,000. To supply those things will impose no
great strain upon the liberality or the wealth of Cali
fornia. The training to be given at the farm would
furnish the State with a number of young men able
to undertake the skilled work of farming, horticulture
and viticulture, who would be useful in the promotion
and advancement of those great industries. Thus
California would not only have the benefit of con
serving in the ranks of useful citizens many youths
who might otherwise be forced to augment the crowd
of the unemployed and discontented, but it would
also materially strengthen its rural industries.
It is to be borne in mind that according to the plans
of President Crowley tbe institution would be non
sectarian. It is designed ,to help the youth of the
State who need help, and not to inculcate any par
ticular creed or dogma. It is therefore one which
merits the support of the liberal of all churches or of
no church, and it is to be hoped the support will be
promptly given.

for a conference with the executive committee of the. iourney
men, last Thursday. Three "conierences were held, and Saturday
night the following: was agreed on:
The demands of 'the journeymen as to hours, and union rules were

END OF BUTCHERS STRIKE
IS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G . STREET, N.
TV., -WASHINGTON, June 16.â Safe
steamer lines across the Pacific Ocean
have been established as a result of the
operation of a plan proposed by the Navy
Department a year ago. '
These lanes are thirty miles wide and
insure safe navigation, for no obstruc
tions have been discovered. Reports re
ceived by Captain C. C. Todd, hydro
grapher of the navy, from sixty com
manders' of warships, governmet trans
ports and merchant steamers show that
not a single menace to navigation exists
within the limits of the tracks platted by
the department. The lanes across the Pa
cific connect . San Francisco with Hono
lulu, Guam and Manila, San Francisco
with Nagasaki, Puget Sound ports with
Nagasaki and Honolulu with Guam and
Nagasaki.
The benefit which' will result to the car
rying trade of the Pacific is thoroughly
appreciated by exporters and steamship
men on the Pacific Coast, and they pro
pose to use their influence to obtain the
adoption by Congress of Rear Admiral
Bradford's recommendation for a com
prehensive survey of the Pacific Ocean.
Captain Todd-in his annual report will
strongly urge that Congress be asked to
make an appropriation which will enable
the department to fit out a ship to make
the survey, and Rear Admiral Bradford,
chief of equipment, will incorporate this
recommendation in his report.
Naval attaches of Germany, Great
Britain and Japan have taken considera
ble interest in the proposal of the Navy
Department for a survey, and they have
suggested the advisability of the partic
ipation of- their governments. If 'these
governments should act with the United
States in this matter it is pointed out that
the ocean could be divided and each na
tion survey that section which Is espe
cially important to its commercial inter
ests or in the vicinity of its insular pos
sessions.

Radical Time Changes. Coast Division
DON'T GET LEFT.
AFTER a heated discussion of
more than four hours at the
Turk-street Temple yesterday af
ternoon Journeymen Butchers'
Workmen's Union No. 115 declared
their contentions with their employers at
an end and will ask to be restored to the
poeltions they vacated last Monday morn
ing. This result was accomplished after
a long series of debates and the use of
seme unparliamentary language.
Originally the union had some 1400 mem
bers, but only a tenth of that number
were present during the day. Shortly
after the meeting opened Organizer Pierce
announced that the wholesale butchers
had issued a second ultimatum that all
men who refused to return to work by 10
o'clock Monday morning would be for
ever debarred from employment. Later
came a message that the Retail Boss
Butchers' Association, representing nearly
3OJ of the leading retailers, had decided to
take no part in the strike.
A motion to declare the strike off was
finally made and unanimously carried and
the chairman announced that all were at
liberty to return to work.
When the doors were opened Secretary
May said:
"We will furnish a statement to the
press of our position to-night, after we
meet the executive committee of the
Â¦wholesale butchers. We have nothing to
Bay at present.
Isaac Frohman, attorney for the whole-
Kale butchers, was advised early of the
action of the journeymen, and said:
"I know of no meeting called of the
executive committee for to-night. Mr.
Rodolph, the secretary, I have not seen
nor heard from all day. It would be diffi
cult to get the members together at such
ehort notice, and this proposition to meet
the committee can be easily called a bluff.
When the men return to work they will
be treated as Individuals, and their
cases will be considered according as
they are valuable or need employment."
Some of the more radical members of
the Journeymen's Union are proposing to
strike off the rolls of the union the names
of the men who went back to work during
the earliest days of the strike.
MILLIONAIRE TO JOIN
CARPENTERS UNION
Colorado Laboring Men to

J v ton's Name.
COLORADO SPRINGS. June 16.â W. S.
Etratton's wealth is variously estimated
at from {15,000,000 to $30,000,000. Despite
this he has put In an application for mem
bership in local union JCo. 515 of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners of America.
Stratton was a carpenter before the In
dependence mine made him. wealthy and
was a skilled workman. A few days ago
Robert Kelly, a member of No. 515, met
Stratton and asked him to join. Stratton
replied, laughingly, "I'm broke." A few
days later Kelly asked him, "Have you
got. the price yet?" Stratton replied that
he had managed to scrape It up and put
In his application for membership, which
â¢vill be voted upon at the next meeting.
Mr. Stratton'6 election as a. member, of
course, is a foregone conclusion.
"Do you know what this means? It
means that they are going to kidnap me.
They will try to get me some night. They
will carry me to a hospital and bind me
hand and foot. Then they will beat me
and torture me till they make me insane."
"I have special Information,", shouted
the general overseer to his followers,
"that a law has just been juggled with
special reference to me. These doctors
have fixed it so that an insanity com
plaint does not have to come from a rela
tive now, but may come from any man
who says he acts in the public interest.
With all this, Dowie repeated continu
ally his pretensions to be Elijah reincar
nated, making way for the end of the
world, and he incidentally laid claim . to
immortality, until such time as his work
was accomplished.
He said that the kidnaping might take
place to-night, and after hl3 service he
called a special private meeting of the
male members of Zion to take steps to
help the Zion guard in protecting him.
He also made threats against the physi
cians that he would do them as he
thought they were trying to do him, un
less they shall let him alone.
CHICAGO, June 16.â John Alexander
Dowie announced at his meeting in Zion
Tabernacle to-day that certain physicians
of this city had formed a plot to kidnap

Retail Boss Butchers' Association. Ac
cording to reports 2S4 representatives of
the various shops were present and the
following officers were elected: President,
H. C. Flageollet; secretary. John H. Lar
ney; treasurer, Frank
Consideration of the present conditions
of the trade were discussed, and after a
lengthy consideration of affairs the fol
lowing resolution was adopted:
Resolved. That in order to keep harmony and
integrity In our ranks we will not take up
the fight that lies between the journeymen,
the wholesalers and the Jobbers.
A minority wanted to uphold the strik
ers, but only ten of the total number of
votes cast were recorded against the
proposition.
Another matter that was considered
was the proposition of certain members
to have the association indorse the forma
tion of a stock company to erect or pur
chase a slaughter-house or plant. This
was lost by almost a similar vote.
The proposition to display union cards
was briefly discussed but no action was
taken.
After the meeting President Flageollet
said: t
"All the trouble between the employing
butchers and their help arose over the
union cards. When we first met in confer
ence certain terms were proposed. These,
after other conferences and some slight
modifications, were accepted, and all was
harmony. Fred W. Sanderson was elected
business agent of the journeymen, and a
few days later went around to every shop
in the city with the framed union card.
â¢Display this if you will, or put it where
it won't be seen, just as you please,' he
said.
"Some shops displayed this card, and
then Eome 150,000 cards bearing the union
label were passed around among labor
unions asking that union men patronize
only shops where the union card was dis
played. Some of us, in districts where the
union feeling does not run so strong as
in others, did not display the card. Then
Sanderson reported to .the union that'
some retailers v;ere not living up to their
agreement, and the short-lived strike en
sued. The wholesalers took the matter
in hand, because they, like the owners of
retail shops, felt that they had been bad
ly imposed upon. We resisted, and the
result that followed is well known to
everybody. Upon the shoulders of Mr.
Sanderson must " rest the burden of the
Inconvenience suffered by the people of
this city." ' â¢ â¢
The association will meet again next
Sunday at the same place.
Ironworkers Returning to Work.
Some of the ironworkers who went out
on strike are returning to work. A num
ber will resume their old positions this
morning in some of the larger shops. In
order that they may be protected they
will remain within the inclosures of the
various establishments, being fed and
housed there. No estimate of the number
of men so returning could be obtained
last night from reliable sources.
The Ironmolders* Helpers' Union will
meet on Wednesday night for permanent
organization at 1159 Mission street.
Secretary Ed Rosenberg of the San
Francisco -Labor Council after his ardu
ous labors of the past few months suc
cumbed to the strain and is now confined
to his bed. He expects with a few days'
rest to be able to resume his labors.
The Coal Teamsters' Union will meet
at Gambrinus Hall next Tuesday evening.

Shipping Intelligence.
The big freight steamer Hawaiian was
expected from the islands yesterday. The
heavy northwest weather has probably
delayed her.
The mail steamship Sonoma is now in
first class trim and will get away prompt
ly on time next Thursday for Australia-
had finally to pay $30 a month, which Is
the ' largest wage paid deep water men
in years. The Himalaya, is bound for
Australia.
THE warships in port drew a big
crowd to the water front yester
day. Everybody wanted to see
the Oregon, and in consequence;
nearly a dozen launches were
kept busy from 1 to 6 p. m., carrying peo
ple to and from that huge fighting ma
chine. Boats laden with people came and
went every five minutes, but there was no
confusion and not a single accident.
On board the Oregon everything was in
readiness for visitors. Petty officers were
there to show people over the ship and
men were at every station ready to ex
plain everything to the curious. ; From the
keel almost to the fighting top; and from
stem to stern the crowd swarmed over
the vessel, and at one time during the
day she seemed to be alive with people.
Every part of the ship, save the officers'
quarters, was open to the public, but in
no instance waa the liberty abused.
The quartet of warships, formed by
the arrival of the Oregon, was again at
anchor off Folsom-street wharf. The Wis
consin broke the combination early Fri
day morning, by going to sea, but formed
it again on her return yesterday morning.
<The youngest, but in many .respects the
most formidable of the fleet, was away on
her final trial trip. It was not a test of
speed, but of her sea-going qualities, and
she came triumphantly out of the ordeal.
There was a clause in the contract for
the Wisconsin that called for a sea trial
six months after she had been accepted
by the Government. It was this trial the
battleship had Saturday. A board of
naval officers and Chief Engineer Porsyth
of the Union Iron Works were aboard. A
run to Santa Barbara channel was made
and on the way back all the guns were
used. A fusillade was kept up from the
time Point Conception was passed until
the fog came up Saturday afternoon.
During the run the Wisconsin averaged
16.08 knots an hour under natural firaft
for two hours. The rest of the time she
jogged along.
This will be a great day among the boys
on the warships. . The much-talked-of
race between crews from the Wisconsin
and Iowa will be rowed to-day, and every
man on the fleet stands to win. a month's
pay or go broke on the event. The race
will start from Hunters Point about
1 p. m.
Movements of Transports.
Uncle Sam has chartered the steamship
Wyfleld to carry supplies to Nome. The
vessel arrived from Puget Sound' yester
day with a cargo of coal, having made
the run in the good time of eighty-fivo
hours. On the way up, however, her crew
thought she would never make Flattery.
A sixty-knot gale blew right in her teeth
nearly all the way and^the first day out
from San Francisco all she made against
it was thirty-five miles. Being light, sho
would not steer and the steamship Po
mona stood over to her to see if anything
was the matter. After discharging hero
the Wyfleld will go to Seattle and take
the Rosecran's cargo to Nome.
It now looks as if the Rosecrans will
not be ready for sea for months to come.
The Government sent her to Tacoma to
be repaired and as soon as she got there
the machinists and boiler makers went to
work and tore the machinery and boilers
to pieces in order to overhaul everything.
Then the strike came and the transport's
engine room was a wreck. Had she been
left alone her own crew of engineers
could have fixed things up so that the
trip north could easily have been made,
but now nothing can be done without help
from the shops.
The transport Buford, with the Forty
first Infantry, Is fully due from Manila
via Nagasaki and should arrive any hour.
The transport Hancock will sail for Ma
nila on the 25th inst. She will take away
a number of cavalry and some teachers.
Liverpool Manned at Last.
Captain Lewis of the ship Liverpool has
at last secured a crew and will probably
get to sea to-day. Fourteen of his men
are "hayseeds," whom he Is paying $20 a
month, while the other fourteen are AB's,
whom he is paying $25, and each one of
whom cost him $25 "blood money." The
ship has been tied up waiting for men
nearly ten days and in that time it has
cost the owners far more than the differ
ence in the pay.
Two of Crowley's boatmen who went
out to the Liverpool with a sailor yester
day did a clever piece of work on the
way back. It was blowing strong and
there was a nasty tide up that made sail-
Ing difficult. The Whitehall half filled with
water and nearly went down. The men
got her before the wind, however, and
maneuvered their waterlogged craft into
smooth water. Then they sailed her back
to Valle-Io street, but when the float was
reached she was still half full of water.
Water Front Notes.
The ship Yosemite that was recently
condemned on the Sound has been pur
chased by San Francisco parties, j She Is
to be thoroughly overhauled and- her rig
changed to a bark, after which she will
load lumber for Australia. Captain Ham
ilton, late of the Mauna Ala, will com
mand her.
The bark Himalaya was delayed two
days for want of a crew. ' Her owners

DYSPEPSIA
When Prof. Munyon says his Dyspepsia Cure
will cure indigestion and all forms of stomach
trouble he simply tells the truth. It will cure a
stomach that has been abused by over-eating and
over-drinking. It will cure a stomach that has
been weakened by old-style drugs. It will do much
toward making an old stomach act like a sound one.
At all druggists, ascents. Fifty-six other cures.

A. H. PAPE BEATS THE
BEST TEBT-&HOT RECORD
Fine Marksmanship Displayed at
Shoot of the Columbia
Club.
The Columbia .Pistol and Rifle Club held
its regular shoot at Harbor View yester
day. A. H. Pape.beat the best 10-shot rec
ord (34), held by F. O. Young, by 7 points,
making the marvelous score of 27. The
score in detail was 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2 â
27. It will be seen that six of his shot3
were in the two-Inch ring and all of them
in 'the four-inch ring, which is a feat
never performed before. Not satisfied
with this score, he tried to better it and
succeeded in recording another as follows,
all being- in the live-inch ring, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4,
4, 5. 3, 1, 1â35.
Hardly had the cheers died away when
A. J. Brannagan was declared the winner
of the Cossrrove medal for a score of 10
shots in the five-inch ring. This he did
with a 3S-caliber revolver. The medal has
been up over a year for revolver or pistol
and Mr. Brannagan has won over the pis
tol. At the same time he beat the club
revolver record (37), which -was held by
F. O. Young, by 1 point with the follow
ing score in detail, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 1, 4â
36. Mr. Brannagan immediately put up a
gold medal for a score in the four-inch
ring, oDen to pistol and revolver. Mr.
Brannagan's 36 tied Young's best pistol
score to-day. A. B. Dorrell ted with the
22-caliber rifle and Captain Fred Kuhnle,
the veteran shooter, made the fine score
of 49, being second to Pape, with the fine
rifle. Many visitors witnessed the shoot

At an informal meeting held yesterday
at the San Francisco. Yacht Club house
It was decided that as the Vallejo Yacht
Club has already challenged the Corin
thians' for the Perpetual Cup. nothing
further will be done at present with re
gard to the construction of the yacht
designed by / Crowninshield of Boston.
The craft will, however, be built during
the winter ready to challenge in ffood
season next year. The yacht with which
the Vallejo *acht Club challenges is
about thirty-five feet over all. with a
length on the water line of twenty-five
feet, and a centerboard with a double
drop, having a draught of nine or ten feet.
This construction will enable her to car
ry an immense area of sail, her center of
stability being very low down. The Cor
inthians, it is understood, have accepted
the challenge, and will probably defend
?he trophy with Frank Stone's Prestn.

about 11 o'clock and cruised either in the

faisquoc, too, was an early victim and
to go out to Wedgewood. a dog that naa
never done better than to take seconi
money In the many courses in which riis
<iiioc was his opponer.t, was not what the
v/ice expected. Two and a half to on*j
was the price on Healey's money getter,
but the good thing did not come.
For Freedom showed some speed
against Flying Fox, but was not in I*,
in cleverness with him, and lost by a
score of 3 to 7. The old timer has not
finished his days on the field, for it is tbo
intention of his owner to start him in
open stakes, virtually at the bottonc. of
the ladder, and try him, out until he gets
back to some form, or proves himself out
of the game.
In the Class Stakes, Lady Clare, the
choice for final honors, was beaten point
less by Tyrone Prince, a short ender. at
2 to 5. The Grafter ranÂ«a great dog; in
this event and is highly deserving for
his exhibition of stamina. It took four
courses in which to decide between him
and America, the Grafter finally winning
by a clean score. In the next round
against Kocker and with 4 to 1 against
his chances the son of Royal Crest won
quite handily, and following up got the
nag from McKinley without allowing him
a point. McKinley was a 5 to 3 favorite.
Olita, after beating Modest Lad and
Tyrone Prince, outpointed Rosie Clair, a
5 to 3 favorite, and War Eagle, who waa
backed at 1 to 4. She beat John Doa
pointless in the final.
The runner up did good work throusrh
cut, which speaks well for Jones, his
new trainer. The best of the short e:ads
were:
Royal Archer beat Best Bargain at 5 to t.

Gladys, his litter sister, for first honors,
and Ollta, Sterl & Knowles' clever .lttlo
performer, won the deciding course of
the class stake from John Doe.
Two dozen errors of judgment were re
corded asalnst the ones who call win
ners In advance and as a consequence
the holders of steerage tickets assumed
an air of importance through both
stakes.
Despite the many short ends the decis
ions were justly earned, the occasional
flukey course failing to materialize.
Palo Alto was not at his best. In hia
course with Homer Boy a week ago the
champion was given a severe trial that
lasted the limit and killed bis chances
for that stake. His comparatively poor
showing yesterday was attributed to that
go, though before losing to Harlean
Uladys he had a much harder course
with Vandal than was thought good for
him.
The two stakes which were offered to
Union Park patrons yesterday resulted
in all around good coursing. '

Callahan is a modest lad. He has met
the Terrible Terry on three occasions and
gave the champion his hardest contest.
Once he won from McGovern on a foul
in eleven rounds and another time he
went twenty-five rounds. Their third
meeting resulted in favor of Terry. Cal
lahan says he does not underrate Hegarty
and will train faithfully and hopes to win.
The long journey overland had no ill
effect on the men and they are ready to
begin training for their bouts to-day.
Carter and Callahan will train at the Six-
Mile House. Both claim that the eleven
days remaining will be sufficient to put
them in the best of trim. Carter says he
is young and does not believe in using
up vitality in the training quarters. He
has been in the ring five years and dur
ing that period has met and defeated
some of the best men before the public.
He is broad shouldered and deep chested.
Carter is said to be the most symmetrical
man in the arena to-day.
"Kid" Carter of Brooklyn, who is
matched to box Jack Root, and Tim Cal
lahan of Philadelphia, who is scheduled
to do battle with Tim Hegarty before the

ON SCENE OF BATTLE
Evidence at the trial of the case in the
criminal branch of the Supreme Court In
the spring of 1S99 - showed that - the wo
man's skull had been crushed with a piece
of lead pipe and traces of this pipe were,
it was alleged by the police, discovered
on Dr. Kennedy's clothing. Dr. Kennedy
was ' convicted and Â¦ sentenced to-be * ex
ecuted at Sins Sing. The Court of Ap
peals on November 20, 1900, handed down
a decision granting a new trial. | Dr. Ken
nedy was next prosecuted before Justice
Fursman during the latter part of last
year, the second trial resulting: in a dis
agreement. District Attorney Philbin
transferred, the case to the General Ses
sions and assigned Assistant District At
torney Osborne to prosecute it
Thus the Jury stood until the sixth bal
lot was reached, when the result was:
For acquittal, 8; for conviction, 4, and
four more ballots resulted in the same
way, ten In all being taken.
Emeline C. Reynolds, better known as
Dolly Reynolds, was found dead with her
head crushed in a room at ! the Grand
Hotel August 16, 1898, where she had gone
with a man answering Dr. Kennedy's de
scription. The dead. woman's corset was
found to contain a check for $13,000 signed
"Dudley Gideon" and . indorsed by "Sam
uel J. Kennedy." The theory of the po
lice regarding this was that it was in pay
ment "of alleged winnings at the races.
The first formal ballot resulted: For
acquittal, 6; for conviction, 6. The next
ballot stood: For acquittal, 7; for convic
tion, 5.
On the first ballot taken the six who
were willing to vote in advance of a dis
cussion of the case stood: For acquittal,
2; for conviction of murder in the first de
gree, 3; for second degree, 1. The other
six put In blank ballots.
Mr. Moore will ask District Attorney
Philbin to move the quashing of the in
dictment and if the latter does not take
this step to free Dr. Kennedy Mr. Moore
himself will make that motion, arguing
that the State has shown twice its inabil
ity to convict his client of the crime
charged and that the old idea of two
disagreements being equivalent to an ac
quittal ought to prevail in this case.
Immediately after the adjournment of
the court the attorneys for the defense
saw Judge Newburger in regard to their
next step in behalf of Dr. Kennedy. Tha
Judge Bald that they should see District
Attorney Philbin as to whether he would
agree udoii the course he pursued. He
said that he (the Judge) would be out
of town to-morrow, but that they 6ould
appear . before him Tuesday to make
whatever motion they desired.
NEW YORK, June 16.â The twelve men
who. since 12:15 o'clock yesterday after
noon, at the conclusion of the Judge's
charge, considered the evidence in the
third trial of Dr. Samuel J. Kennedy for
the murder of Dolly Reynolds, reported
to Judge Newburger at 10:25 o'clock this
morning that they were unable to agree
on a verdict. The Judge at once dis
charged the jury from further service and
remanded the prisoner to the Tombs.

SIXTY enthusiastic Olympic' Club
members indulged In a cross
country tramp yesterday. Over
hills and down dales they
tramped, arriving, at their desti
nation, Willow Camp, footsore and weary,
but hehrtily glad that they had made the
trip.
The distance traveled, was eighteen
miles, and it was made in the good time
of two hours and a half. Â¦ At Camp Wil
low an excellent lunch was spread. The
remarkably fast time made by the pedes
trians in covering the distance was slow
when compared to the time it required for
the boys to demolish the array of . good
things spread under the trees for. the
satisfaction of the inner man.
Britt, Sherry, Starr and Stone were the
first of the "Weary Willies" to . reach
Camp Willow. Leonard, in an endeavor
to reach the goal before Britt, lost his
way, and wandered about the valley for
some time, searching for the path that led
to the cool, grassy glades of the camp.
The rest of the party made its way
slowly but surely, satisfied that the four
leaders would be unable to make aw.iy
with all the good things that had been
promised the members making the trip.
The walkers spent several hours at the

Tive Runs Are Batted In During the
George S. Hodson, Oakland's new twirl
er. made his initial bow to the local fans
yesterday afternoon at Recreation Park.
His delivery was a puzzle to the Senators,
and they were only able to make four hits
during the game. Hodson had wonder
ful control and sent his select assortment
of shoots over the rubber in a manner
that bewildered the heavy stickers from
the Capital.
"TrucJc" Eagan shared in the ovation
given trie new. pitcher. Eagan played
wonderful ball. He neatly stopped many
poor throws to the initial bag and made
a one-handed catch that created enough
noise to be heard blocks away, and the
shouts swelled into an uoroar when he
threw to Francks and doubled Stricklett
at second.
"Youngey" Johnson played clown with
success. Throughout the game his antics
kept the big crowd in a joyous mood. He
proved himself a coacher par excellence.
The Oaklands were in great shape. Seven
runs and ten hits were evidences of their
prowess. The Dudes opened auspicously.
Drennan slammed out a two-bagger and
was scored on Streib's duplicate. The
following inning Moore walked, stole sec
ond and came home on Hod^on's hit to
right. They scored again in the third,
and in the sixth three more runs on four
swats made Stricklett feel very sore.
The Legislators gained their only tally
In the seventh on errors by Arrellanes and
Francks and a single by Unhappy Joe
McGucken.
Streib's circus catch was a feature of
the game. Umpire Tyler went through
the game without hurting any one's feel-
Ings or Inflicting fines. There was no
back talk and the game was the best play
ed in the series.

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 7, Sacramento 5.
Hanlon virtually presented yesterday
morning's game to Oakland in the first
inr.lr.g. His muff of Eagan' s easy fly was
inexcusable. The error proved costly, as
Drennan scored and the next two men up
secured singles and subsequently scored.
Had he caught the ball, it would have
made the third out.
Only seven innings were played, but the
contest was full of vim. Cooney was in the
box for the Legislators and was pounded
hard. In the last inning the Oakland nine
fell on his curves tooth and nail and when
the spasm ended four runs and five hits
were recorded. Courtney made a home
run hit, which was his first during the
series. Following is the score:

As President and Mme. Loubet left the
Elysee, two youths, to satisfy a craving
for momentary notoriety, shouted: "Vive
Deroulede." "They were arrested, but
subsequently released.
The victory of Cheri was popular, as he
is a French horse, but was a disappoint
ment to a majority of the bettor*, who
backed Saxon as a certain winner. The
betting on the favorite was even. On
Cheri it was 14 to 1 against, 30 to 1 against
on Tibere. 20 to 1 against on Lady Killer,
and 14 to 1 against Olympian.
King Leopold of Belgium, who is on a
special visit to Paris to attend the race,
was present, as were M. Deschanel and
Falieres and most of the cabinet min
isters. The Count and Countess of Castel
lane were present.
Longchamps presented a brilliant scene
during to-day's racing and more pretty
toilettes were visible than for several
years past. The sky was overcast mo.-st
of the time, but there was no rain and
the contest- for the Grand Prix was
favored by a brief spell of sunshine.
President Loubet, accompanied by his
wife, drove to the race course with tradi
tional ceremony, in a four-horse landau
with outriders and escorted by cuirassiers.
Rigby rode one winner, second place in
two events and was unplaced in two
others. Â¦ *
Distinguished Spectators.
The final race, the Prix du Due d'Aoste.
showed Henry again having considerable
trouble with Pomme d'Or, on which he
won yesterday. Pomme d'Or made several
false starts at the post and finally, when
the horses got away, ne was last and
twenty yards behind the bunch. He ran
well, however, but failed to recover the
ground lost at the start and . finished
fourth.
The running of the Grand Prix produced
a splendid finish between Cheri and
Tibere, Cheri winning by a head. Lady
Killer, with Lester Reiff in the saddle,
came in two lengths and a half behind the
second horse. The correct time of the
race was 3.09. The betting in the mutuuls
on the Grand Prix totaled 1,706,840 francs.
The Prix: d'Ispahan was won by Mr.
Vanderbilt's Dido. Legers, ridden by
Rigby, was second, while Monociciar,
Henry up, an equal favorite with Dido in
a field of three, finished last.
In the opening race, the Prix d'Arme
nonville. Henry's riding of Pile et Face
made this horse a favorite. Henry lost
ground from the start and finished third,
Rigby taking second place on Lieutenant.
William K. Vanderbilt's Dolphin did not
get a place.
Henry Has Poor Luck.
The big American contingent present in
the paddock to-day lost a considerable
sum on Olympian, as well as on Heniy'3
four other mounts, as the success of
Henry yesterday tempted Americans and
a large number oÂ£ Frenchmen to back
him to-day. ,
Although Olympian failed to secure the
Grand Prix to-day, the Americans here
gather much satisfaction from the fact
that for the first time in the history of
this race the winning horse was ridden by
an American jockey, Rigby having the
mount.
Cher!, the winner, Tibere, which go't
second place, and Lady Killer, which was
third, all passed Olympian, coming down
the hill into the stretch. Olympian, now
hopelessly beaten, fell back and finished
next to last. The winner- covered the dis
tance in. 3:09.
After two false starts, owing to the
nervousness of Olympian, which Henry
had much difficulty in mastering, the
horses got away in â¢ good shape, with
Olympian ahead. Olympian maintained
the lead for half the distance. Theft, as
he was taking the incline, the fast pace
told upon him and it could be seen that
lie, could not stay the entire distance.

SANTA ANA, June 16.â The last day of
one of the most successful conventions
ever held by the California Christian En
deavor Union was characterized by an un
usually large attendance. At both meet
ing places the afternoon services consisted
of concert programmes. Miss KatherlnÂ©
Stockton of New York and A., Horace
Cogswell of Berkeley rendered numbers
at both places.
At the church Dr. E. S. Chapman of Los
Angeles, superintendent of the Anti-Saloon
League, conducted a temperance rally, in
which a brief history of the temperance
work in the State was given. The speaker
made a most eloquent appeal for Chris
tian Endeavorers to take a more active
and earnest part in the suppression of the
liquor traffic.
At the opera-house the Rev. Richard
TJader, an evangelist from New York, dis
coursed upon "Christ to All the World."
The address was confined largely to mis
sionary work, showing the great effort
being put forth by Christian peopl* to en
lighten the uninformed on true religion.
An overflow meeting was provided at
thÂ© Baptist church to-night because so
many could not gain admittance to either
the opera-house or convention church. The
little Misses Adams sang "Welcome- to
Jesus" at both church and opera-house. 1
At the convention church the Rev. D wight
E. Potter of the Union-street Presbyterian
Church, Oakland, made an earnest and
effective talk on "The Wages of Sin Is
Death," and at the opera-house the Rev.
Richard TJader of New York made a
strong appeal to the unconverted. Â¦
The northern delegates propose to see
something of the southland before return
ing, and consequently will spend next
week in sightseeing. Monday they will
go to San Diego and Coronado, returning
to Los Angeles Tuesday. Wednesday they
will go to Catalina, Thursday to Mount
Lowe and Friday they will take a trip
around the kite-shaped track, making
short stops at San Bernardino, Redlands
and Riverside. / ,. .

"The present role of 'Cigarette* was rot
of my own seeking. Mr. Frohman, Mr.
Belasco and Mr. Potter, the dramatist of
the play, appeared to think I could give It
a satisfactory interpretation. But it is
not very far from the truth that I have to
thank my proficiency as a horsewoman."
"I am under a special writing with Mr.
Belasco for a term of years, and I am to
appear in a round of characters for which
he seems to feel I am peculiarly consti
tuted. There is a horseback ride by 'Cig

urged to undertake the character, and I
do not regret doing so, for everything has
been so pleasantâ the company, the man

dates its first presentment two years ago
at Wallack's Theater, New York. The
scene of the play is laid in Poland, the
time during the invasion of the country
by Kapcelon. Miss Roberts as Countess
Valeska has the picturesque role of a
Polish patriot. White Whittlesey is seen
as the hero, her lover, and a soldier; and
Marie Howe and Agnes Rankln make their
reappearance.
The Police Commissioners will fill the
vacancies in the department by July 1,
and they expect the City Council to au
thorize an increase of ten men, which has
been recommended by Chief of -Police
Hodgkins. Â¦ â¢ ."'Â¦Â¦.'
Chief Hodgkins declares that the de
mand for more policemen is imperative.
There are now five vacancies in the reg
ular force, which at best is inadequate
to meet the requirements. The large ter
ritory annexed two years ago has de
manded better protection. Many of the
beats as now arranged are "so extensive
that It is impossible for a patrolman to
cover them in one watch. For example,
one in East Oakland extends from Lake
Merritt to the city line on the east and
from East Seventeenth street to the city
boundary on the north.
After the robbery was completed the
pair of highwaymen ordered Powers to
walk ahead and make no outcry under
penalty of being shot." He obeyed, and
after following behind him a few steps
the men turned and walked rapidly away.
Before he reached home Powers met a
policeman and told the story of the rob
bery. He could not give a good descrip
tion of his assailants. They are sup
poaed to be the pair that recently held
up Miss Augusta Williams at Madison
and Ninth streets and L. Hlnz at Twen

Powers reported to the police that he,
was grabbed by one robber, who jumped
at him from the shade of some trees, and
deftly relieved him of his money before
he had recovered from his surprise at the
attack. The second footpad stood behind
Powers in the shadow, but ready to grab
him if he made any attempt to resist.

morning G. S. Powers, residing at .1530

Count von Buelow concluded his speech
by calling for three cheers for the Em
peror and the fatherland.
The 8000 people present then, sung the
national anthem, and at a signal from the
Emperor the veil fell from the statue and
the fountains started playing, amid the
ringing cheers of the assembly. On the
pedestal of the statue there appears the
single word, "Bismarck." Emperor Wil
liam alone mounted the steps and deposit
ed the first wreath at the foot of the
statue. He then turned to Prince Herbert
Bismarck while "Deutschland Ueberalles"
was sung. The Emperor and Empress
then inspected the memorial arid the va
rious deputations laid a mound of wreaths
at the feet of the statue before their ma
jesties took their departure.
May the name of this great man always go
before the German people an a pillar of flra
on good as on evil days. May our German
people face their future in peace, freedom, well
being and strength under the leadership of
the glorious house of Kohenzollern, on whose
shoulders the nation's future rests.
Only fools and fanatics would maintain that
Bismarck never made , a - . mistake or that th*
maxims he laid down must, be applied In all
circumstances. Rigid dogmas do- not hold
either In political or economical life. Bismarck
himself did not lay great stress upon the doc
trine he taught us, that no personal fancies,
transitory Ideas or antiquated theory, but only
the practical and enduring interest of the com
munity should govern the national policy.
What his whole work teaches us is that it Is
essential in politics always clearly to recog
nize the limits of the attainable and to stake
all upon the attainment of what will be of
advantage to the ' country. Bismarck belongs
to no party; he belongs to the whole nation.
In the domain of politics Bismarck was what
Goethe was In the domain of mind. He is our
guarantee that the nation can never surrender
its right to unity, independence and power.
Living: in middle Europe, we have no alterna
tive but to be always en vtdette. "We are strong
enough, however, to maintain our Independence
on every side. Divided by opposing principles
In politics, economics and creed the empire will
never be without Internal conflicts, but these
will no longer be able to shatter what was
forged thirty years ago. Exegl monumentum
a.ere rerenntus. (I have reared for myself a
monument more enduring than bronze.)
Count von Bulow then eloquently
sketched Bismarck's stupendous work In
establishing the empire, that aspiration of
centuries for which the noblest spirits had
strived in vain and for which a long ar
ray of martyrs in the German cause had
fought and suffered. Continuing, Count
von Bulow said: Â¦â¢-'.Â¦Â¦
Among the whole German people there is no
one but knows that no vestige of the Iron
Chancellor's days upon earth will disappear
that the admiration and gratitude toward him
will increase while German hearts beat or
while German fists are clenched. Bismarck's
was a leonine nature. Upon earth he stood
amid the dust of battle. Battle brings with
it Just opposition,- unjust misunderstanding
honorable enmity and blind hatred. While the
dust Is dispersed there remains only the mem
ory of unparalleled deeds and of peerless per
sonality.
I BERLIN, June 16.â The Bismarck
statue, facing the Column of Victory in

veiled at midday to-day in the presence
of the Emperor and Empress, Prince Her
bert Bismarck, Count von Bulow, Prince
Hohenlohe, the Ministers and the mem
bers of the legislative, houses and the me

array of officers, officials, veterans' asso
ciations, students, etc., and an enormous
gathering of people. Emperor William in
spected the guard of honor and then took
his place under the baldachin with the
Empress. A thousand school "children
sang in chorus and Dr. von Levitzow, Con
servative leader of the Reichstag, deliver

Bulow, the Imperial Chancellor, then
made a speech as follows: ,

TWO MEN MUST ANSWEB
IN A ROBBERY CASE
Court Fines Father of a Defendant
for Complicity in Affair of
Bribery.
NAPA, June 16. â Julius Brox, a wood
chopper, who has been in the employ of
Joel A. Pedler at Trubody station, seven
miles north of this city, was robbed of $39
about a week ago. He charged Henry
Grigsby and Matt Clune with the crime.
These men were arrested, and the District
Attorney soon afterward accused John T.
Grigsby, father of one of the arrested
men, with having bribed Brox to leave
town and thereby prevent prosecution.
Brox was found at Vallejo and brought
back here.
' Yesterday he testified that he had been
given $40 by Clune on a promise not to
appear in court. Justice Palmer held both
defendants to answer before the Superior
Court and flxsd the bonds in each case
at $5000. John T. Grigsby, father of one
of the accused men. was fined $100 for
complicity in the bribery of Brox.

lators.
Rumors Circulated That Many
Concerns Are Heavily â¢
Embarrassed.
BERLIN, June 16.â The Boerse had an
other black week. The Frankfurter Zei
tung says:
"Seldom have fear, distrust and anxiety
been as pronounced as during these days."
Busines Is at a standstill. The orders
for sales find few takers, and then at a
heavy loss from the quotations. Only- on
Friday and Saturday did trie market be
come somewhat firmer.
The week began with- tho crash of the
Dresden Credit Ansalt and the- Kummer
Electric Compa'ny, which owes 9,000,000
marks to the Dresden Credit Ansalt alone.
Rumors are in circulation to the effect
that a number of other electric concerns
and the banks supporting them in Dres
den, Berlin and Dantzlc are in serious
difficulties. The Dresden Society of Elec
tric Plants and Railroads seems heavily
involved.
Throughout the bears attacked all along
the line, bringing about greatly reduced
quotations, even for such strong societies
as Rombacher Minings. Following this
came the blue book on the Transvaal
Railroad, which caused a sensation in
Berlin, as it had been firmly believed that
the British Government would favor tho
German shareholders of the road.
Altogether, the Boerse situation during
the past week is one. that has only been
equaled in the worst. time, and it is Ken
erally thought that there will be no mark
ed improvement for a long time to come.
The bears particularly selected bank
shares for their attacks, and the securi
ties of every bank lost a number of points.
Tho only gleam of light in the week's
situation was the agreement of tho Boerso
committee favoring the abolishing of the
worst features of the present Boerse law,
but it is uncertain whether the Reichstag
will adopt' the report.
' LONDON, June 16.â The London Stock
Exchange was very slightly roused this
past week from its long continued leth
argy. The air is now cleared from the ef
fects of the recent American crisis, but
business still remains painfully dull. The
hesitancy of the last week la also largely
traceable to a desire for definite assurance
of the tangible developments in the South
African war. The depression accompany
ing the decline in gilt-edged securities has
seriously hampered the resources of many
of the strongest members of the Stock
Exchange, while it is whispered that some
banHs are even so Involved as a result of
the assistance rendered large operators,
that they are now unable to press for. a
settlement lest they precipitate a crisis
involving large Interests.

BOSTON. June 16.â The work on behalf
of the religious life of the young men the
world over was told in words of earnest
ness, force and eloquence from more than
a hundred pulpits in Boston to-day. This
was the practical close of the Internation

Christian Association. Delegates, laymen
and ministerial, pleaded for a wider sym

the young men's cause.

PRINCESS HATZFELDT. the
adopted daughter of the late C.
P. Huntington. accompanied, by
her husband. Prince Francis von
Hatzfeldt, a retinue of servants
and tons of baggage, slipped quietly into
San Francisco last night, and are quar
tered at the Palace. Their coming was
unheralded and their entry into the city
Â¦would have been unnoticed had not the
Princess been recognized by old friends.
The Prince and Princess were driven to
the Palace Hotel, where they were as
signed rooms 124 to 129. The servants, of
Â¦whom there are many, followed with
wagon load after wagon load of baggage.
Every effort was made to keep the visit
of the German Prince and his wife a se
cret, and success would have crowned
these efforts were it not for the recog
nition at the ferry. They were plainly
attired and their arrival made no more
stir about the immense caravansary than
the ordinary traveler. They went to their
apartments immediately upon their ar
rival at the Palace.
Just what brings the titled pair to San
Francisco is not known, but it is believed
their visit is due to matters pertaining
to the distribution of the vast estate of
the late railroad magnate.
Princess Hatzfeldt at the time of her
marriage was a tall, slender brunette, an&
carried herself with a proud air, which she
still retains, together with much of her
former beauty.
Princess Hatzfeldt Is the adopted daugh
ter of the late Collis P. Huntington. She
was married to Prince Francis von Hatz
feldt at Brompton Oratory, London, Octo
ber 2S, 1SJ9. The marriage aroused in
tense Interest in the United States. The
Prince, though tiie bluest of German
blood flowed through his veins, was prac
tically without fortune. Before the wed
ding ceremony was. performed Collis P.
Huntington deposited with his prospective
son-in-law's trustees $1,750,000 in bonds of
the United States and other gilt-edged se
curities, the income from which, it was
specified, was to be enjoyed equally by
the Prince and his wife; also that in the
event of the death of either husband or
wife his or her share of the income was
to -go to the issue of the marriage.
Upon the death of the railroad mag
nate it was found that he had bequeathed
to Princess Hatzfeldt $1,000,000. By the
terms of the will this money was to be
held In trust for his adopted daughter. It
provided that the capital was to go to her
issue, failing which it was to go to such
persons as she" should direct.
The will further provided that should
the bequest made to the Princess be re-
Wilson and Leahy looked sheepish and
told the favorites to hurry and make an
appearance, as the audience was restless.
When Hartmnn and Cashman heard
about how they had been accused of be
ing strikers they grinned, and Ferris was
heard to exclaim "Well" several times.
"What the " began Hartman. and then
stopped. "Say, Doc," he continued, "what
ails you? You were all right when Harry
and I left you this morning to go to
Tamalpais. We had a swell time, but the
engine broke down on the way back and
we were delayed for about an hour. I
thought, now that the Baltimore House
was chut up. it was perfectly safe to
leave you and Wilson, but I see you have
found another 'joint.' "
But the comic opera stars threw no
bombs. The press agent was safe. Doc
Leaiiey rushed up to Hartman and asked
in a quavering voice, "Is it true?"
"Yes." said Ferris. "We were "
"Don't I pay you enough?" asked
Leahy.
Hartman and Cashman looked in
amazement at the manager.
For the entrance, two steps at a time,
dashed Hartman and Cushman. "They
are going to throw a bomb." shudderlngly
muttered Wilson as he dove for a place of
safety.
Wilson opened his mouth and prepared
to pour forth the silvery phrases that
bad been surging under his hat for that
awful hour.
It was exactly S:15 when Wilson was
eeen to straighten up. Hartman and Cash
man were observed dashing up Eddy
Etreet.
Eight o'clock came, and "Wilson sent
for a glass of water. "I must prepare
myself," he muttered. "They will be here
Boon, and upon my shoulders rests the
responsibility of giving the lie to the as
sertions of 'Guggenheimer' and 'Schwartz
enbach.' "
Visions of Hartman and Cashman pa
rading in - front of the theater as
boycott pickets disturbed the serenity
of "Doc" Leahy. Jack Wilson hastily
prepared a few oratorical gems and sta
tioned himself at the top of the steps
leading to the opera-house, prepared to
harangue the multitude which In his
mind's eye he saw surrounding the en
trance and afraid to enter.
Rumors were rife about the Tivoll last
evening that Ferris Hartman and Harry
Cashman had organized a "Toymakers'
Union" and were engaged in planning a
strike. The rumor was apparently well
founded, for neither of the Thespians put
in an appeamce at the opera-bouse at
their accustomed time.

CAUSE A FRIGHT
The proposition is to hold an evening
session in the park and arrange the pa
vilion in the form of a grand camp, where
all the candidates for admission into the
several camps will be admitted and given
the various charges which teach the les
sons of the organization. They will also
be given the secret work. It will be the
first time that initiation of candidates has
taken place in this State outside of the
regular meeting rooms of the camps. The
pavilion will be transformed into a forest
with living trees and the officers will sit
behind genuine stumps instead of the or
dinary paraphernalia to be found in lodge
rooms. The forest will be illuminated, as
is the custom in meeting places in the
backwoods, and all will be done that can
be to make the afEair as realistic as pos
sible to meet the spirit of the ritual.
The lighting and decoration of the pa
vilion has been intrusted to the entire
membership of Maple Camp of Center
ville The placing of the candidates will
be attended to by H. W. Lynch, Jo
seph Petty and W. H. Wollard.
In addition to the initiatory work there
will be a competitive drill by about ten
teams from as many camps. Thus far the
teams of Golden Gate, "Western Addition,
Mission, Oakland, Alpha, Forest, Red
wood and Maple camps have entered in
the contest. The prizes offered are em
blematic badges, a silver ax valued at $50
and a sword for the captain of the team
