were crystallized Into ' the definite 1 an
nouncement,that 3. A. â¢ Fillmore, so long
connected. with the' Southern Pacific,* was
to ; follow j Jack Wright from the com- "'
pany's service, and that h'ls" place was to

cular was dated July" 9; more than two
months after The Call's announcement..
Announced in May.
On May lit was definitely announced In*
this paper that E. II. Fitzhugh was to ;
have the position of assistant to the pres
ident of the Southern Pacific. . Something â¢
to that effect had been said by. The Call '
before,- but on that date it was definitely
announced, and yes'terday ithe appoint- \
ment was made. _, In . a little" circular Is- Y
sued under the signature. of Charles- M.,\

announced to all concerned that "Mr. E.
H. j Fitzhugh . is', hereby appointed ' assist- -
ant to the, president, with Â¦ office in San
that every one concerned denied each
statement generally and specifically and
at all times.
Call first exploited the fact that Hays
purposed to form a cabinet to advise
him, and gave the names of those who
to the changes in the Southern Pa
cific service are being verified ;with
each vacancy, and most recently by the
three changes that have justtaken placeâ
the resignation of J.' A.' Fillmore, which
The Call has been predicting for months:
the appointment of J. M. Herbert as his
successor, which The Call has been pre
dicting nearly as long, and the' appoint
ment of E. H. Fitzhugh as assistant to
President Hays, which The Call has been
predicting for weeks past, and In spite of
the fact that every one else was fully
sure that Fitzhugh had a place some
where among the heads of the depart
ments picked out for him.
There are certain methods of newsgath
erlng which are always reliable and ef
fective, and in adhering to these methods
The Call has all along been fully advised
of the condition of things within the great
corporation that controls the West. It
was early aware of j the Intended removal
of Fillmore, either by resignation or dis
charge, and it .was advised of the name
of his successor almost as soon as he had
been decided upon.

One of the employes of the place sad
dled a horse and rode the forty-five miles
into this city in about three hours. He at
once reported to Mr. Doherty, proprietor
of the Union Lumber Company, which has
its lumber prepared at the Mount Breck
enridge mills.. After giving a graphic "de
scription of the tragedy to his employer,
he engaged Dr. J. L. Carson to go to the
scene to attend to the wounded, all of

intjuest will be held, with the object of at
tempting to fix the responsibility for tho
lynching. While the messenger was of the
opinion that there was no regret expressed â¢
over the fate of Yung Fcok, because of his
unwarranted assault. It Is said there were
a few in the number who rebelled against
hanging him without allowing him time to
regain consciousness. â¢
1 Mrs. Kinney Is unable to account for the
cook's assault. It is said that she was
taken unawares by Yung Fook, who
seemed to become violent very suddenly.

stabbed could not be got from the messen
ger, who even failed to 'leave his r.amo

tragedy. If any arrests be made, the pris

Messenger Brings the News.
As soon as the employes of the place
realized what had happened they started
for the Chinese, but h.e waved a bloody
butcher knife in the air. and rushed aim
lessly around the dining room. He pre
sented such a formidable appearance that
the men backed into the yard. Af ttr a.
'â¢moment's consultation . they - decided to
rush into the house In a body. The Chi
nese, not expecting such a sudden movo.
wa3 taken unawares, but although he wn-3
thrown almost from his feet by the united
assault he held the knife firmly in his
hand and with an almost superhuman ef
fort wrenched h'.mself free of the loggers.
Before he could be got_ under control he
had stabbed slightly two or three of the
men. Finally one of them struck Yung
Fook on the head and rendered him un
conscious.
Without a moment's hesitation and be
fore the Chinese was given time to regain
consciousness, in order that he might
realize that with his life he was about to
pay the penalty for his crime, a rope was
fastened around his neck and he was car
ried hurriedly to a nearby tree. As the
men, who were themselves half crazed
with anger, pulled on the rope, which had
been thrown over a limb, the unconscious
man swung high in the air. The cook's
body was left hanging to the tree. Those
who had been wounded were attended by
those who had assisted In the lynching.
Breckenrldge saw mills and logging camp,
forty-flve miles from this city. Tun? Fook,
a Chinese cook, while crazed from opium
this 'afternoon stabbed Mrs. G. C. Kln
ney, wife of tfie foreman of the mills, her
daughter and two or three of the loggers.
Within a few minutes after he had com
mitted the crimes his lifeless body was
hanging from tha limb cf a tree high
above " the heads of the Infuriated men
who had witnessed the, stabbing.
The tragedy occurred shortly after the
noon hour. The loggers,. mill hands nnd
teamsters, who were eating their midday
meal, noticed that the cook wa3 acting
lc a peculiar manner." He was surly, but
as the men finished eating he walked
quietly into the kitchen. The men were
soon put In front of the dining house,
smoking and chatting, when thejj heard
-the screams of the women in the house.
In a moment Mrs. Kinney rushed throiig-h
the front door, her face cut to the bone
over the right cheek ami her clothing
covered by blood. No sooner had she
been surrounded by the men than her

with a knife wour.d In the wrist. She was
closely followed to the front door -by the

THE CKEYSEUS' VICTIMS
It is predicted that the convention will
not reach the order of nominations until
late to-morrow afternoon, and that the
proceedings' may be protracted into the
night With all the efforts of the Mc-
Lean-Kilbourne men for harmony, there is
evefcy indication of unusual scenes on the
floor of the convention over minority re
f)ortg, especially on credentials and reso
utions. â¢ â¢
The McLean-Kilbourne element, while
unusually courteous, made no concessions.
The old State Committee met "previous to
the district meetings and gave the tickets
to the McLean-Kilbourne men where there
were contesting delegations, and they took
all the districts except those which in
-clude Cleveland, in wnich, under the unit
rule, they could not controla vote.- But
the Johnson men, after the district meet
ings, promptly announced that they would
carry the tight into the Committee on Res
olutidns and then into the convention to
morrow "for a finish." They- have, two
strong men and vigorous speakers in
Hersley and Baker, both members of
Mayor Johnson's cabinet at Cleveland.on
the Committee on Resolutions.
In the Twentieth and Twenty-first dis
tricts, which include Cleveland, the John
son men had things their way aa much as
the McLean men in the First and Second
districts, which Include Cincinnati. But
in the rural districts the latter element got
almost everything. - The controlling ele
ment did not "riae rough shod" over mi
norities in any of the 'districts, -but when
names were proposed for places on the
committees there were inquiries as to how
they stood,, and if the replies were not sat
isfactory they were "excused" * in some
cases as quicKly as jurors, and In others
with ballots. - â¢ v ' â¢ "
COLUMBUS, O., July 1 > 9.â The McLean-

this afternoon secured control of all the

In the course of his 'speech. Sir Henry.
Campbell-Banntrman met the Imperialists
so far as to say the war must be brought
to a victorious conclusion, but he thought
the Liberals ought to insist on amnesty in
the settlement. While the country had
the sword in one hand It ought to have
the olive branch In the other and show a
disposition to come to terms with an en
emy that had rought so bravely.
Asquith expressed the highest apprecia
tion of the^ qualities of Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman, but at the came time he
regretted that vthe Liberal leader in the
House had not*been' more outspoken in a
policy of honest difference, rather than In
an attempt to reconcile differences. He
urged that those taking the views which
he himself held should be free to express
their opinions within the pale of the
party. Asquith thfen supported the reso
lution of. confidence in Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman: â¢

Endeavorers.
Appeal Made for the Negro at
tli3 Cincinnati Con
ference.
CIXCrNNATT. Ohio. July 9.â The fourth
fiay of the conference â¢ of the Christian
Endeavor Society was a light one as far
as the programme was concerned, but
the Endeavorers were out en masse at
two big meetings to-day. * At the last
moment the three big music hall railies
were concentrated into two meetings
which were held in Auditoriums Endeavor
and WiUiston.
The chief address was tnat pf Principal
Booker T. Washington of the colored
Normal School at Tuskagee, Ala. He took
as his subject, "The Power of a Noble
Life." He traced hJs career from the time
he was a slave, and -told of his work
among the people of h:s race.
"I don't believe that in all Â«the history
of the country," he said, "has there been
such need for strong-, unselfish, pure s.nd
Intelligent men who are willing to sacri
fice ambition, position, fortune and com
fort for the welfare of their fellow-men.
The noblest of lives and the one thing
worth living for - is the opportunity to
make seme individuals more happy, mere
useful." He made an impassioned appeal
for h'.s people, and. asked that they be
judged by the best among them and not
the lowest. He said the privilege of
teaching and enlightening a fellow human
being v.as the highest privilege given to
any man and that he" long ago learned
that to cherish hatred even against the
white man in the South was unchristian.
He was glad to note that this spirit was
rapidly gaining a foothold among his peo
ple.
In Auditorium Williston, where the
Rev. Allan B. Philputt of Indianapolis
presided, a number of addresses limited
to five minutes each were made. The
Rev. Charles M: Sheldon of Topeka.
Kans., was among- the speakers.
Miss Margaret Koch of Waterville, Me.,
conducted a personal equipment confer
ence ct the Ninth-street Baptist Church.
The members of the board of trustees and
other officers of the United Society gave
a banquet to President Clark at the Grand
Hotel at noon. He was presented with a
silver loving cup in commemoration of
the twentieth anniversary of the Chris
tian Endeavor. In the afternoon Dr.
Clark attended the rally at the Walnut
Hills Congregational Church, where Sam
uel B. Capen of Boston presented to him
an immense memorial, signed by over 200
of the leading educators, editors, clergy
and business men in the United States, as
sn expression cf thankfulness and appre
ciation for the work that Dr. Clark has
done in organizing and guiding the Chris
tian Endeavor. : â¢ .' >
What was probably the prettiest of the
meetings of the convention was the an
nual Junior rally held in Auditorium En
deavor in the afternoon. â¢ Secretary John
Willis Baer addressed the meeting. Then
followed numerous . exercises by the
Junior Endeavorers of the local churches
and the children of several orphan
rtsylums. The children, dressed in white,
filled the immense stage and made an at
tractive picture.
Continued from Page One.
place, and at the first symptom of any
fine personal . work he- will find himself
without office: Â¦; Herrin has been - Â§hrewder
than most people . thought, and about all
that keeps him in his position now is the
personal element he has injected into the
fights ostensibly fought for the company
whose servant he is. Â¦
Made Personal Friends.
It is conceded that he has a grip on the
Railroad Commission that cannot be
Shaken off, but he has made of the Com
missioners personal adherents and not
friends of the company. He has the same
grip on the State Board of Equalization,
but there again he has made personal
friends for himself .instead of for the com
pany, and so for years he has been play
ing both "ends against the middle until he
has made himself, personally, the medium
through which the railroad deals with the
people who are most useful to it. For that
reason, "" so long as the present Railroad
Commission is in power, and so long as
the present -Board of Equalization is in
existence. Herrin must be retained for the
friends he has made through the influence
of the railroad and while supposed to be
working wholly in his company's in
terest.
It is the hope of the new president to
get along without the Herrin political
bureau. It is his idea that the legal de
partment is for the care of the lecral
work of the company, not for the build
ing of Its political fences, and so Herrin
and his office will be relegated to a place
unaccustomed to them, and far from the
political pool in which they have so loved
to swim. "It -is the intention of the new
administration to conduct a railroad busi
ness and not an abnormally developed
piece club, and under that theory it can
well afford to dispense : with many of
Herrln's r>eculiar talents.' .- ;
Change in Accounts.
j The reports that there will be Impor
tant, changes' In the auditing department
of the Southern Pacific are without foun
dation, so far as they relate to the higher
officials .of that branch,, altho'ugh it is true
that" svstems .will --be changed. In some
cases materially. The changes have no
alarming .significance, however,, Â¦ for they
will be. only such changes ' as i would be
made , in . any business which has been
joined to others. "It is evident to all who
understand the situation that Harriman
runs the Southern Pacific absolutely, and
Hays looks to him for all final policy and
decision, and so it is intended that the
bookkeeping of the Southern Pacific. Com
pany shall conform to the system of ac
counts and records of the flarriman in
terests. The changes will all be In the
line of this policy.
Fillmore maintains that his' relations
with President Hays are the most cor
dial, and he says he will be looked out for.
but beyond that he will say nothing for
publication about what he -intends to do
or what the Southern Pacific will do for
him in return for years of faithful and
efficient service.' He started his career as
a railroad man in 1866 as a brakeman on
the Delaware and Lackawanna Railroad,
and from that he rose rapidly until he
was soon in the ranks of railroad men of
note. He came to the Central Pacific, af
ter an extensive experience in the East,
in 1870, and four years after he took tho
position of division superintendent at Sac-

TURAL BUILDING AT BUFFALO.
The a'verage daily attendance at the
Buffalo Exposition has been about 38,000.
Probably the expectation of the manage
ment of the exposition that there would
be & total attendance between the initial
opening and the final closing of the gates
of 15,000,000 to 1C. 000 ,000 will not be realized.
The attendants of most value to Cali
fornia, in the sense of being possible fu
turo dwellers in the State, will not appear
at the exposition until after the haying
season Is over in the East, these being
the agriculturists. After hearing the in
quiries and comments of the visitors to

volume, for that would have made a
volume too bulky for use, but all sections
of California will be treated in the same
way in other volumes. Only the beginning

of the ' Southern Pacific Company has
approved of the work and has expressed
the opinion that It is excellently devised

There are twelve pages of handsome illus

through the hole. Finally they, loosened
the bottom of the boo.rd and i touched a

"We have easily the best exhibition in
our. line at this exposition," wrote Mr.
Filcher. "In the aggregate we show prac
tically "every product and possibility of
the State, and the arrangement and color
blending are such as to make at once a
striking impression upon the visitor. The
beauty of our display and the excellency
of our products seem to have been spoken
of abroad by returning visitors. New
comers on entering the grounds for the
first time are frequently heard to inquire
for the California exhibit as something,
we learn upon inquiry, they have been
told to be sure to see." Mr. Filcher also
reported that Buffalo affords the best op
portunity for placing reading matter of
any place that he has found in his round
of expositions. There -is no reasonable
limit to the amount that can be profitably
dipposed of.
Mr. Mills and Mr. Filcher agreed in the
statement that while American' travelers

who has just returned from Buffalo, de
scribed what had been done and dis
cussed the probable benefits that- may be
expected. He made the striking statement
that all the horticultural. exhibits of the
Central and South American countries and
also oi the other States of the Union, if
combined in one collection, would not be
more than 20 per cent of the California
offering to the public at Buffalo. Indeed,
so strongly does California preponderate
in the horticultural building that the
structure Js commonly called "the Califor
nia building." The California exhibits oc
cupy 35 per cent of the entire floor space.
A written report was also received by
the Board of Trade from Secretary J. A.
Filcher, who had charge of the installing
of the California exhibit and who is now
in charge of it. He wrote that in spite of
leaky roofs, bad weather and other diffi
culties that were aggravating the installa

After the Court had ruled- upon the mo

lease Leventon, Eades and Brown, the al
leged lynchers. Judge Harris and Attornej
Raker introduced the matter again. Theii
language offended the Court and each
was fined $500 or five days in Jail. Harris
went to jail, but Raker slipped out foi
San Francisco, where he placed the mat
ter before the Supreme Court. It seemed
that he had hardly time to reach that
city, before the Sheriff here received the
telegram to release Harris from custody.
Harris and Raker had the coup well
planned and when the Sheriff went to loch
up the 'two men only Harris . could be
found. . :

visitors would look at the oranges from
Oroville and would say that they were

it fixed in their minds that all the semi
tropical fruits of California came from
the southern, part of the State.
Basis of Benefits.
Mr. Mills said that Buffalo is well
situated to catch visitors, being on the
line of travel between the East and the
West. Thousands of visitors see. the show,
by taking lay over tickets, who would
never visit it if they had to go out of their
way to reach it.
/The statement of most importance that
was made by Mr. Mills was that relating
to the amount of benefit that California
might expect to derive from the Buffalo
Exposition. He said that it would depend
upon the skillful marking of California
products. In the East a very large per
centage of the population lives upon the
coal and iron trades, but California must
rely largely upon the products of the soil.
He doubted the advisability of publishing
statistics concerning the vast amounts of
any crop' that the State was producing,
for the intending settler in the State
would be deterred, thinking the present
population could already bring to market
all the products so advertised that the
market could take. The dealers in fruits,
etc., would also be afraid to buy largely,
in view of the statistics of imposing size,
because they would expect that the very
quantity would possibly reduce the price
after they had purchased and so be of
disadvantage to them.
E. L. Ayers of Hanford and G. G. Ken
nedy of Oakland, lecturers, addressed the
board and asked for indorsement of plans
to advertise California in the East with
lantern slides. , The propositions were re
ferred to a' committee to inquire and re
port.
A Californian, writing from Chicago,
makes the suggestion that, California is
missing a. golden opportunity in falling to
let the facts concerning the summer cli
mate in this State become known to East
ern people by leaflets. These leaflets, he
thinks, should be handed around at the
Buffalo Exposition to Eastern people, to
whom, in view of the death of hundreds
by reason of ! the heat ' in the Eastern
States, the summer climate of California
would seem as grand a3 its winter cli
mate. â¢

in Illinois, where he was elected District
Attorney of Johnson County at 23 years of

Shortly afterward he removed with his
family to Los Angeles and in 1S87 served

At 4 o'clock yesterday morning a party
of twenty-three, with a Chinese cook, left
Santa Barbara for the islands. The
launches Bumblebee and Chispa were
towing the sailing boat Ariel. At 10
o'clock a. heavy sea with a southwest
wind was encountered. The craft soon
separated. The three aboard the Bumble
bee experienced great suffering. Combers
broke over the launch and the oars were
in the water continually, as the engine
was disabled through the breaking of the
connection with the battery. The Bumble
bee is only eighteen feet in length. In
seven hovrs it drifted thirty miles.-
Miss Laughlin is highly praised by her
companions. She rowed and bailed out
water at all times, not resting a moment.
At one time they were within three miles
of the west end of the island. The sea
v.-sp rougti until 10 o'clock last night. At
dusk they were at the lower end of the
Island, while this morning they wero
within ten miles of this port, and with
considerable difficulty reached the wharf.
AH were completely exhausted. Miss
Laughlin has a sprained wrisjt. They re
turned by this evening's train to Santa
Barbara.
VEXTURA. July 9.â Three unlucky
channel tourists drifted Into this port at
9 o'clock thi< morning. They were L. M.
Tliggins. Alfred W. Hay ward and Miss
Clara Laughlin. They were glad to be
alive and they wanted food and rest. For
nearly thirty hours they were without
food, sleep or anything to drink.
Perils of the Bumblebee.
The three from the Bumblebee arrived
by train from Ventura this evening. The
men say that had it not been for the ef
forts of Miss Clara Laughlin, their lady
passenger, they would have gone down.
When they became exhausted from row
ing Miss Laughlin managed the boat for
two hours in the dead of night and let
them get a little sleep. She was thrown
from the bow against the engine when the
first wave broke over the boat, but bailed
out. the boat all day and most of the
night. The waves which the little craft
had to battle against rose' fifteen feet high
and threatened to engulf them each time.
Everything moveable went overboard. Â¦
The other boats landed in safety in the
afternoon. The Ariel party put into Fry's
Harbor and the launch into Lady's Har
bor. As soon as word was received here
the big gasoline launch Peerless started
for the islands, arriving about four hours
later, against heavy sea and wind. The
island party believed the Bumblebee lost,
but were greatly relieved when they heard
of her safety. All of the ten passengers of
the Ariel were sick on the passage over,
and but for the cool head of the boy, Don
Leach, all would have been lost.
Young Hero and Heroine.
Fears were allayed at 4 o'clock this af
ternoon, when \the yctcht Ariel, the only
sailing vessel of the! pleasure fleet, arrived
in port and reported all sare. There was
a crowd at the dock to receive the yacht
almost as soon as she was In sight, and
before she could land small boats put out
to meet her. There was only one person
aboard, Don Leach, a boy or 17, who had
volunteered to come to the mainland and
procure more gasoline for the launch t'nat
nad been reported sunk. He was much
surprised when told how great was the
anxiety of the people ashore.
The boats left here yesterday morning at
4 o'clock, and before noon were off Santa
Cruz Island, making good headway,
though the sea was nasty. The Chispa, a
thirtr-foot whaleback, with engine, car
ried Idne persons. She was followed close
ly by the Ariel, a sloop yacht, carrying
ten. The launch Bumblebee followed.
When within three miles of the island the
Bumblebee shipped a heavy sea. which
disabled her engine and placed her at the
mercy of the waves. She rolled and drift
ed, losing sight of the other boats' in a
few minutes. A strong wind from the isl
ands carried her Into mid-channel.
SANTA BARBARA, July 9.â For hours
to-day this' city was plunged in darkest
gloom, pending word from a party"* v of
pleasure-seekers who left here yesterday
morning for Santa Cruz Island and who
were reported lost at sea. Among the
party were members of prominent fami

SEATTLE, July 9.â The Cook Inlet
country in Alaska Is coming to the front
again. Streams which were supposed to
ho good for nothing are now yielding from
$3 to $5 a" yard, and one . pocket In the
Turnagain Arm district, Bear Creek, pro
duced $150,000.
Charles C. Weathersfield, who lives In
Southern California, brought the news of
the conditions in the' Cook Inlet country-
He had with him 5200,000 from his own
mines in the Turnagain Arm District.
Said he:
"Since the e present rush .for Cook -Inlet
this season by hundreds of prospectors
and miners, It is almost impossible to get
shelter, as the hotels will not accommo
date one-third of the people, and three or
four more hotels would pay very well
there. As it Is the men have to sleep
out of doors in. the tents.
"There were a great many new strikes
made last fall on streams that were sup
posed to contain no gold at all, and at
ihe present time these streams are paying
very "richly, running from $3 to $5 per
yard and more. There was picked up on
Crow Creek an $84 nugrget by one of the
prospectors in doing dead work."
Mr. Weathersfleld said that just as he
was about to leaVe the Arm at Sunrise
City, there had just beÂ»n reported one of
the richest- strikes that the geld fields of
Turnagain Â¦. Arm had ever- ha/I, $150,000
being taken out of a single pocket on
Bear Creek. This creek is being oper
ated by hydraulics.
TACOMA, July 9.â William Waechter of
Dawson, who returned to-day, has cleared
more than 5100,000 during the last three
years by shipping meat and cattle to the
Klondike. He claims that conditions at
Dawson have radically changed.
"Dawson la not the lively city it was
a few years ago," he said, "and it prom
ises to get quieter each year. The claim
owners are now working their property
with improved machinery and it does not
require so many men to get out the same
amount of dust. Hereafter there will be
little work done during the season of
long nights. Most of the mining on the
creeks will be done by the hydraulic sys
tem.
"Men who took supplies into Dawson
this year expecting to get fancy prices for
them were doomed to disappointment, and
the speculators lost money. Dressed beef
is selling for 17 cents a pound and other
food in proportion. Many people have
gone in for market gardening, and there is
one chicken ranch established up there. I
was surprised to eat lettuce in the latter
part of April that was grown in that coun
try, and in May home-grown radishes and
lettuce were plentiful. There is no longer
any doubt that good vegetables can be
raised in the Yukon country.
"I expect to see Dawson chanpre into a
cheap camp, and although there is plenty
of gold there, it is almost certain that Chi
nese and Japanese will be brought in to do
the work, to a large extent, at least. Res
taurants and hotels are still making
money, for they have managed to main
tain prices, and it costs just as much for
a meal now as it did two years ago. when
provisions were scarce and prices high."

LONDOX, July 9.â Both the Americana
and the British have been congratulating
themselves on the fact that the Henley
regatta passed off without international
friction of any kind. The congratulation3
were premature. Friday night the- Le
anders gavo a dinner to the Pennsylvan*
ians. All the prominent rowing authori
ties were present, The speeches teemed
with compliments. The British, said they
had never seen a better nor more sports
manlike crew. The PennsylvanianS' replied
that they had never been more fairly and
squarely beaten. The only explanation
was that tho Leanders were tho bette?
crew. The speeches were all of this tenor
until one of the American crew said ha
wished to say that their treatment at
Henley was splendid. They had found all
the arrangements in regard to tha races \
1 perfectly fair, "contrary. to what they had/
been told." \ .
The British oarsmen were 6tnntoaxu3e4
and did not answer while tha PezuurrU
vanians were there, but the storm broka
out immediately they had departed, and
still continues. Tho Leanders ara bit
terly Indignant, and say they will not roiff
against the Pennsylvanians again.
The head master of Eton writes to tha
Times to-day advocating the exclusion oi
foreign crews from. Henley.
"It the result of Friday's race had been
different," .writes Dr. warren, "whateve?
we might hawe thought wÂ© could not
have uttered our thoughts without In-i
vltlng the disagreeable retort that ira did
not know how to take a beating. As it
is, we must speak, and this being so. I
wish to avoid any imputation, of chnrlisn*
nes3 or discourtesy. I have nothing but
admiration for our American brethren,
who, at the cost of Infinite pains, months
of preparation and great expendltcro,
have come to participate in our regatta:
The good nature of tho stewards of tb.4
Henley regatta in permitting the rowing
trophies entrusted to be contended for by 5
all the world will endanger the. best ini
terests of amateur rowing, for the en*
couragement of which, they were cvrlgN
nally presented. I do not wish foreigners
excluded out of any selfish fear lest thq
prizes go to foreign lands.. for I feel con*
vinced that we are good enough to hold
our own, but I do most earnestly deslro
that our amateur oarsmanship may bo
preserved from the deadly charge ox pto-Â»
fesslonalism which is already making a
business of so much that ought really
to be a pleasure and threatens to crushj
the life out of sports In England. If an
International regatta is thought to be de
sirable, there will be no difficulty in pro.
viding suitable trophies and a proper
course. By all; means, let us preserve our

couragement of amateur rowing 1 In the v

The Athletic Association is patterned
after, the .Olympic Club in San Francisco

consolidation is not yet effected there
seems to be nothing that will prevent it.

steps have been taken toward the ab

Wheelmen. The subject has been under
discussion for some time, but no\move
has been made "by' the wheelmen toward
meeting the overtures of the association
till last nfght," when the wheelmen voted
to accept the proposition if two-thirds of
the club would sign their consent to the
-amalgamation. The wheelmen's organ
ization has never been a success from a
financial, standpoint and it is thought that
the absorption will strengthen both and
detract nothing from vne glory of the
.wheelmen, who have won a name and
record that is enviable in wheel circles.

adopted, both of which will tend to ex

rule 14, which reads; "A foul hit ball not
caught on the fly js a strike unless two
strikes , have , already been called." The
second change is: "A ball thrown by the
pitcher to a p}ayer other than the catcher
(except to retire a base runner) and bats
man 1 standing in proper position shall be
called a ball." This is to prevent waste

NEWPORT, R. I., July 9.â None of the
big racing boats moved out of the har
bor to-day. It was intended to take the
Constitution out for a short spin In the
afternoon to try out a couple of new jlb3,
but about 3 o'clock a threatening squall
came up from the west, and It was decid
ed that the boat would better remain at
her moorings. , .
It was rather expected that a little bal r
last would be taken out of the Independ
ence to-day, but Mr. Adams,* who is In
charge, has decided to make no change
until after to-morrow's race, at least.
On the Columbia there was practically
nothing to do. The managers and crew
of the Independence are still undismayed
by the showing their boat has made thus
far, and are aa full of hope and courage
as ever. They feel that their craft has had
an unusual run of hard luck in finding
all the bad spots possible in the two races
in which she has sailed. They know that
the boat has sailed fast In a good breeze,
and they believe that she will yet surprise
those who have condemned her as a hope
less candidate for- cup honors.
In discussing yesterday's remarkable
performance of the Constitution; Mr. Dun
can said, to-day he thought his boat had'
all the advantage of better winds, and
he did not believe the Constitution could
beat the Columbia by any such margin
under ordinary conditions. He Is perfect
ly satisfied with the qualities of the new
sloop in light weather, but he is still a
bit anxious to see what she will do in a
good hard breeze. â¢
When asked if he considered that yes
terday's race settled the future of. the
Independence, he said: "Not by any man
ner of means. It Is impossible to tell
what she may do under better conditions.
Give the boat a chance. She has not had
a really good trial yet and will surely do
better than she has."- . ,.
To-morrow's race, the third of the New
port Yacht Racing Association's series,
will be fifteen miles to windward and re
turn, if the breeze will allow. . .

GETTING READY
FOR THE BATTLE
Ruiz is still in the city and will be in
court when the cases are called this morn
ing, but the detectives expect to have
some difficulty in finding McPhail. West
was able to furnish $750 cash ball to se
cure his release.
Ruiz offered to furnish the $500 for Hen
nessey, believing that the bet would be
won. On the morning of June 28 the sports
met In a quiet nook in Golden Gate Park.
McPhail was made the stakeholder, but
he only got Ruiz's $500. The race was
run and the unknown easily defeated
Hennessey. Ruiz jumped 'to' the ;cohclu
sion that he had been bunkoed and ob
jected to McPhall giving up the money.
It was alleged, tthat West forcibly took
the money Jfronj McPhatt; and that when
Ruiz tried* to f prevent him from get
ting away with it. West struck him sev
eral times on the head with a revolver,
knocking him senseless.
The man who makes the robbery charge
Is E. L. McPhail and the charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon Is made* by
Romulo R. Ruiz, a barber. Ruiz, about
that time, came from Santa Barbara, and
While visiting one of the sporting resorts
met West. West learned that Ruiz had
money and told him that a friend of his
named Hennessey was the champion 100
yard sprinter of the coast. A "dub" had
been offering to bet Hennessey $500 that
he could outrun him, but unfortunately
Hennessey did not have the money.
Lewis West, known in Bportlng circles
as the "Kid," was arrested yesterday aft
ernoon by Detectives Dlnan and Wren on
warrants Issued more than a year ago
from Judge Cohlan's court, charging him
with robbery and assault with a deadly
weapon. The warrants were Issued July
5, last year, but could not be served, as
West had fled to Seattle. He returned to
the city a few days ago.*

Yesterday's developments In the investi
gation of the robbery of Â£30,000 from the
Mint were of slight importance; Director
Roberts, Superintendent Leach, and se
cret Service Agent Haien were in consul
tation for many hours and questioned a
number of the employes of the building;
The investigation is being conducted in
absolute secrecy and 'every employe was
again' warned" that no information sbeuhl
be given 'out; . .
Certain, statements made to the Investi
gating officers in the last two days have
placed another phase on the disappear
ance of the six sacks of gold; Although
the guilt of ascertain employe w almost
positive, the investigating officiate desire
.Id learn if It Is possible for the vaults of
the Mint to be opened by aperson who Is
familial* with the workings of Intricate
tumbler locks. â¢
Charles Waltz, the well known safe ex
pert, waff called into the Mint yesterday
and for many hours he worked on some
of Hie -big locks. The proposition made
to Mr. Waltz was -that he shojuld try to
open tli6 doors without being familiar
with the combinations. The nature of
Mr. Waltz's mission and the result of his
work was known only ts the investigating
officials. â¢ Â¦ â¢ '" . â¢
x The inspection and. counting of the con
tents of sacko of gold in the big Vaults
continued yesterday. An extra force of
men went to work early In the morning
and continued until the close of the offi
cial day. Nearly $5,000,000 passed through
the hands of the inspectors and counters

While the language of the sections does
not specify that partial. payments are In
hibited, the attorneys of the board say
that under the terms noted, a contractor
cannot receive progress payments, as his
contract may be declared void if he does
not complete it within the time allowed by
the Supervisors. Partial payments have
not been made heretofore,' and Manson
believes- that the charter should be <so
amended as to permit of a contractor re
ceiving a certain percentage of the work
he has " accomplished. . The State allows
75 per cent to be paid monthly on progress
work, while the Federal Government pays
00 percentum. The last named figure Man
son believes to be a fair proportion of
what a contractor should>be paid.
While the board has experienced no par
ticular trouble- in awarding contracts in
the past on account of the onerous condi
tions of the charter it believes that many
small contractors have been excluded
from bidding on that account. The char
ter-has also forced other successful bid

"Warrant Out for the Arrest of Miss
â¢y , Maud C. Howes, Now of
Coif ax.
E. J. Crawford, a Deputy Sheriff in San
Jose, who has temporary quarters in the
Ramona Hotel, swore to a complaint in
Judge Conlans court yesterday charging
Miss Maud C. Howes with obtaining
money by false pretenses.
Crawford 'said he met Miss Howes at
the St. Nicholas Hotel -in January last
year. He was introduced to her by a Mr.
Reed, who lived at the hotel and pre
tended to be her husband. She is a tall,
handsome woman. She told Crawford*that
she had located and then owned a silver
mine in Elko City, Nev.,,the vein being
not less than six feet wide for a consider
able distance. The ore had been assayed
and was worth from $250 to $1400 per .ton.
On these representations Crawford gave
her $1000 for a half interest in the mine,
he says. He went to Elko City, but failed
to discover any trace of such a mine and
came to the conclusion that he had been
swindled. vSlnce then he has-been trying
to locate "Miss Howes, and , has now dis
covered that she is living in Coif ax.
DEPUTY SAYS HE
WAS DUPED BY A WOMAN
The Spring Valley Water "Works filed
a suit yesterday in the United States Cir
cuit Court against the Supervisors and the
city and county of San Francisco to re
strain them from enforcing the new wa
ter rate ordinance. United States Circuit
Judge Morrow did not issue a restraining
order, but cited the respondents to appear
â¢before the -court on August 5 and show
cf.use why they should not be . enjoined
ftom enforcing the ordinance.
The company alleges that it has a cap
ital stock of $14,000,000, divided into 140,000
shares of the par value of $100 each,
which shares are held by 1S0O persons, and
that the ordinance has depreciated the
market value of the shares from $97 to
a figure ranging from $S3 to ?S6. The point
is raised that the new ordinance is unrea
sonable and unjust; that it destroys the
property ; of the comnlainant without
compensation; that it is in conflict with
the fifth and fourteenth amendments to
the constitution of the United States, and
that it was adopted illegally and is there
fore null and void. &Â¦â¢
It is averred that the ordinance was
finally and forever defeated at a meet
ing of the. Board of Supervisors March
18, 1M1, and no motion to reconsider was
made, but that at a subsequent meeting
the rules "were suspended for 'the. purpose
of allowing- Supervisor Braunhart to give
notice that on the next legislative day
he would move to reconsider the vote oh
final passage. It is averred further that
the water rates as fixed in the ordinance
are the result of guesswork and 'were
fixed at % random and it is alleged
that under the ordinance Â¦ the complain
ant's- gross income for the fiscal year,
after deducting operating expenses and
taxes, will be $870,000, which will be
wholly insufficient to pay the operating
expenses and taxes and any reasonable
interest upon the actual value of the
property, and that it would allow only
an interest of 2.48 per cent.
Judge Morrow Is Asked
to Enjoin the cBoard
of Supervisors.
SPRING VALLEY
AGAIN IN COURT
"Why," replied Hotaling, /'the best way
to cure them of that would be not to give
thenVany water'to drink until they
changed their minds." . Â¦ '. .
There was some â¢ further discussion of
the legal aspects of.^he matter and then
it was moved andcarrled that the entire
$20,000 be placed at the disposition of. the
Board of .Works, with the understanding
that all public utilities provided for In the
charter be reported uvon.*M&$82S8&fiS@28Â£
Supervisor Hotaling said .the question,
therefore, was to obtain a definite plan
as to cost, and Reed raised his point on
the provisions of the charter a second
time. "We must proceed upon that," he
said, "and the people, under that docu
ment, are to-have a voice in saying what
public utilities they shall vote upon. Sup
pose, Supervisor Hotaling, that 4000 peo
ple should petition for a 1 vote of bonds to
build a telephone system in preference to
the acquisition of a water supply?!' ;
Grunsky told why it was better, 1/ pos
sible, to avoid bringing water in pipes
across the bay. this making those sources
of supply from Lake Tahoe and tho
American River southward more avail
able. â¢ â¢
Pipes Across Bay Not Desirable.
Then Reed raised the point, which he
continued thereafter to insist upon, that
under the charter no bdnds could be voted
for the acquisition of a public, utility until
the Board of Supervisors was in posses
sion .of estimates of the probable cost of
all public utilities.
â¢It was insisted by the Mayor and Super
visor Comte that this was a strained dis
tinction. Reed admitted as much, but said
he was opposed to running the board up
against a lawsuit that might invalidate its
bonds issued for a specific purpose. .
-There was a long discussion at. this
point as to the *riative value â¢ of the
Geary-street railway system and a sys
tem of waterworks to the city. Marsden
Manson brought it back to the water sup
ply by stating, on behalf of the Board of
Works, that it was thought necessary to
known definitely, before submitting ! a
project to the people, exactly the nature
of the work to be done and what it would
cost to bring 60,000,000 gallons of water
into the city, and to this end the boar'l
wanted authority to expend $14,500.
Reed Cites the Charter.
Grunsky gave them ag thus: \ Geary
street railway, $3400; -Â¦Â¦ telephone system,
$1250; gas light tystem, $1500; garbage cre
matory, $1250.
City Engineer Grunsky , took it upon
himself to answer. He said that It had
been deemed by the Board of "Works that
the water supply was at the present time
the most important. public utility under
consideration. He had, in a general way,
examined all the proposed sources of sup
ply, and it had been determined that the
three most feasible plans for securing
water were tha Lake Tahoe project, the
Tuolumne River plan and the Yuba River
scheme. For many reasons it had been
also determined that the best of these, to
serve as a base for intelligent calculation,
was the Tuolumne River plan. "What the
board wanted was authority to expend,
approximately, $15,000 to make such sur
veys and estimates as would enable the
people to act intelligently upon it. It was
desirable to center effort upon one-pro
ject; not that it would be essential to get
water from the Tuolumne River, but In
order that a basic estinrate of the cost of
a water supply might be had.
Reed wanted to know approximately
what would be the c:st of securing reports
upon the acquisition of the other public
utilities provided for in the charter.
Chairman Charles Wesley Reed, for the
committee, opened the proceedings by de
siring: to know exactly what it was that
the Board of Works wanted.'
The Board of- Public Works met with
the Public Utilities Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday afternoon
for the purpose of securing, if possible,
permission to use $14,500 of the $20,000 pub
lic utility appropriation in the develop
ment of elaborate and definite plans for
bringing a water supply into the fcity.
Every member of the . committee was
present, and every member likewise of the
Board of Works. Mayor Phelan came to
the meeting when he was sent for.

DRUG CO., 3S and 40 .Third 54.It will be perceived that as the Commissioners are
to have charge over nearly all kinds of corporations,
the effect of that stipulation concerning their qualifi
cations is to virtualry exclude about one-half the
voters of the State. There are very few men of any
business capacity who are not disqualified under that
clause, and as a consequence the commission would
be made up of professional politicians. .
A significant part of the scheme is that the com
mission is to be originally appointed by the Gov
ernor, and that of his appointees one is to hold
office for two years, one for four 3 r ears, one for six
years, one for eight years and one for ten years. Thus
the people of the various districts will not have a
vote on their representatives for years to come. The
Governor's appointees would control the commission
for a long time.
It will be seen that this is a very strange scheme
It virtually turns the State over to the corporations,
for of course the commission appointed by the Gov
ernor would hardly be anything more than a railroad
committee.
It is worth noting that the amendment was rushed
through -the Legislature in the closing hours of the
session. That means that the men who are pushing
it are up to many tricks, and it will be well for the
public to bear the fact in mind.

. The paper presented to the country on the Fourth
of July by. the eminent gentlemen who framed it and
signed it is of course of the highest literary standard.
America has no better nor stronger writers than some
of the men whose names are signed to the appeal,
and the paper* by whomever written, is worthy of the
most eminent among them. Passing from its literary
form to a consideration of its substance, there will be
found intensely strong statements of certain phases
of our .dealings with the Cubans and the Filipinos,
which ought to have been modified in order to make
them more nearly correspond with the facts. Thus
the appeal says: "To-day the President is the abso
lute ruler of Cuba. . He spends the revenues of the
island as he pleases. No constitution, no law, fetters
his powers. At his instance Congress has violated the
nation's pledge. The 'independent' Cuban people*
have been told they will not be allowed to establish
any government in their own land unless they sur
render- in part the control of their finances and for
eign' affairs. . .;*' - *,. * They ; are_ offered no option to-
BELATED, but still interesting, comes to us
the Fourth 'of July address of the Anti-
Imperialist League, entitled "An Appeal in
Behalf of Constitutional Liberty." It is signed by a
long array of distinguished men, among whom are
George S. Boutwell, Carl Schurz, William D. How
ells, Samuel L. Clemens, MoorfieM Storey, Leonard
Wolsey Bacon and J. Sterling Morton. A communi
cation from such a source is always entitled tp careful
consideration, and the present one is no exception to
the rule.
The great mass of- the American people are san
guine optimists. They are convinced that almost
everything is right, . and that such matters as are
wrong will be righted in time. Consequently they
look with indifference upon any class of men who
think they perceive dangers ahead. The very title
adopted by the league discredits it in the minds of the
people. "Anti-imperialism" sounds very much like
Bryanism, and the country has long since grown tired
of everything of that sort. Moreover, there is an as
sured conviction on the part of the people that we
are in no danger whatever of empire or .of imperial
ism, and consequently there is a corresponding im
patience with thÂ« cries of the alarmists. ; ,
AN APPEAL FOR FREEDOM.
During the tariff campaigns the Democrats and free
traders made a great light against the protection given
to tin-plate " manufacture in this country, saying it
could not be produced here as cheaply as abroad and
that the protective duty was a tax on the working

THAT TRIBUTE TO REALTY.
THE observation of Mr. Purdy of the Tax Re
form Association, that personal property pays
its tribute to real property, therefore realty
should pay all the taxes and personalty should be ex
empt, m3y be, studied in the light of. his declaration
that Mr. Carnegie should not be taxed on his three
hundred. millions of bonds, which' pay. him eighteen
millions -interest annually. Just what tribute., does
Mr. Carnegie's three hundred millions pay to ; real
Â«tate? _ yyjfl \j
Let us suppose that he isÂ«a citizen .-of- San Fran
cisco and his property therefore all taxable here at
his legal .residence. His bonds should pay a tax of
three millions under our dollar limit. Under the
tribute theory they should pay that rnuch to realty,
which it would transfer, under the single tax, to the
city treasury. Mr. Carnegie has a family of four, and
probably ten servants. He is a plain liver, and it
costs no more to maintain his establishment of foilr
teen than any other family of equal condition and
number. Admit that their clothing, wool, cotton,
linen, silk and fur, comes from the ground, as the
plants, animals and insects which produce it live upon
the ground. So. their food comes from the ground,
and what -they pay for it all is a tribute to the owner
of the ground. But that tribute is not three millions
a year, and, as Mr. Carnegie is exempt to that
amount of taxes, the realty of the city, under the sin
gle tax, must make good the loss to the treasury.
Suppose that Mr. Andrew Carnegie, native of Glas
gow, meet in San Francisco Mr. Con Sullivan, of Skib
bereen. Con is a mechanic, intends to marry. and has
bought a lot on which to build a house when he earns
the money. His income is eighteen hundred dollars
a year, the wages of his daily toil at the Union Iron
1 Works, and Mr. Carnegie's is eighteen mil
lions, for which he cuts coupons off his bonds. Con's
little lot has to pay its share of the tax from which
Carnegie's three hundred millions is exempted. What
tribute does Carnegie pay to Con's little lot to make
him whole? Why should Mr. Carnegie live in' this
town and pay no tax, make no. contribution beyond
the board and clothes of his household, and Con Sul
livan pay his taxes? .
But the single taxcr answers that land is a natural
monopoly and those who own it can exact from all
others what tribute they please for the privilege of
living on the earth. But what tribute can Con Sulli
van, from Skibbercen, exact of Andrew Carnegie,
from Glasgow, as compensation for paying Andrew's
taxes? Con owns a vacant lot and works in a foun
dry. Carnegie owns no realty and boards at the:Pal
ace Hotel. How does his tribute reach Con's lot out
in the Mission district? The Assessor reaches it, and.
the Tax Collector, and it pays tax to hire policemen
to protect Mr. Carnegie on the street and watch the
safe deposit where his bonds are, and firemen to pro
tect him against fire in his hotel. When does Mr. Car
negie call around and pay his tribute to Con's. realty
out of his, three hundred millions of personalty, pro
tected by the laws of this city? . â¢
Now add to Carnegie our multitude of other mil
lionaires, whose fortunes are in interest-paying secu
rities, and tell iis how they contribute to realty a sum
equal to their exemption from taxes? How does the
owner of*a lot get that contribution in coin in his
pocket in order to pass it over to the Tax Collector?
How does trie owner of a lot get it out of the owner
of a million in personalty? v
Governor Jones of Alabama, in addressing the Con
stitutional Convention, denounced lynching, and said:
"We owe it to ourselves and to our God to put a stop
to this reckless business of manslaying." It is to be
noted, moreover, that the Governor's record on that
issue is not made up of words merely. He once pre
served a prisoner from a mob under circumstances
that required a high degree of courage. His example
serves to show that the South is not lacking in states
men able to grapple with the barbarous practice, and
gives encouragement to the hope that it may be
eventually suppressed. *â¢ .

A SUMMER CRITIC.
THE University at Berkeley is managing a very
â¢successful summer school. Th*e attendance is as
large as can be properly taken care of, and that
so many mature people are in the classes is evidence
of their earnest purpose and desire to learn what the
school is intended to teach. A majority of these sum
mer students are women. <The gentler sex especially
prevails in the English course.
Professor Wendell of Harvard see,ms to be toiling
with the English classes and has shown some impa
tience with the material that he is trying to hew into
approved Harvard form. In order that he might
know the sort of intellectual Carrara presented to his
tempered -chisel he had the ladies write compositions,
which were submitted to his Eastern and highly ac
complished judgment - â¢
It is not known whether he finished reading the
numerous productions or not. But it is known that
he issued from the task suffering a severe intellectual
nausea, his Harvard sensibilities retching violently,
and his literary taste blue around the gills. Whpn
he next met his class he dismissed their well intended
literary efforts by telling them that the most of what
they had 'written, was "disgusting slop."
No explanation was made to inform. the class what
Harvard considers slop and what makes the same dis
gusting. Although Harvard has had one professor
hanged for murder and at present has another on
trial for the same offense, she has taste and knows
slop from soup. President Wheeler seemed pleased
with the remark, and quieted the class by expressing
his delight that "we have a man here who is big
enough and strong enough criticize us. That is
what we are here for, to be corrected if our ideals are
not high enough." But the summer world outside
the summer school is not quite- that much delighted.
That Ivorld wants to know if the use of. the term,
"disgusting slop," applied to the conscientibus ef
forts of a large number of earnest ladies, is regarded
as criticism. What made the work disgusting and
slop? Was the slop in the orthography, etymology,
syntax or prosody?
A high school principal from Northern California,
who is a member â and we assume a male member â
of the class, was also pleased with Professor
Wendell's choice of terms in which to criticize his
pupils, and said, "Pupils of mature age have to be
hit hard by the instructor to feel it." That evidently
was the view taken of it by Professor Wendell, so he
hit them with "disgusting slop," and it is the opinion
of the president of the university that it takes a big
man to slap with slop. The further proceedings in
this Harvard court of criticism will be of intense in
terest to a class that needs to be hit hard in order to
feel it. He may be expected to* pursue the same line
of expression, and as their work is "disgusting slop,"
we may yet hear him tell the workers that they are
"a lot of goggle-eyed slobs."
The Northern California high school . principal
says they must be hit hard, for their skins are mature
and thick. The Harvard professor of manners, gen
tility and English may -yet find it necessary to pene
trate the walrus-like pelt that protects the literary
quick of those ladies by calling them "spavined ga
zelles."
How happy are we that he was so good as to
forsake the summer seas of New England, and per
haps an outing at Siasconset, and days of delightful:
clamming around Holmes Hole, for an unpleasant
exile to our summer school, .where he has to wet the
feet of his Harvard taste in the disgusting slop writ
ten by California ladies!
How different it would be at home in Harvard!
There a class of summer ladies, summoned by Pro
fessor Wendell to . sudden composition, would stand
on one foot and duplicate "Evangeline," "The Psalm
of Life,"' or "Mog : Moggohe," "Thanatopsis," or
"The Fall of the House of Usher." Carrying out his
liquid analogy, instead of being compelled to call
their work "disgusting slop," he would characterize
it as "ambrosia," or that New England equivalent of
the food of the gods, bean soup. No doubt he talks
in kitchen equivalents and praises the superior women
of Harvard summer schools by calling their work at
least equal to codfish balls.
refuse these demands, which are backed by the pres
ence of United States troops upon their soil.. Thus
to tlie world our course has become an example of
national perfidy."
Of our dealing with the Filipinos the "appeal says:.
"The war in the Philippines has been prosecuted with
unrelenting cruelty until the resistance of % the un-.
happy islanders seems to have been crushed. - Many
thousands of -their bravest men have been killed, or
have died of disease, during the contest, and to-day
the President exercises a power as despotic as the
Czar's over the whole Filipino nation." ' ' .
Exaggerated statements of that kind,; even when
made with literary 'skill, can hardly have much effect
upon the public mind. It is well understood that the
military authority exerted by the President as com
mander-in-chief .of the army is by no means despotic.
It is to be regretted that the appeal has been couched
in such language, for the problems .which confront
the country in dealing with the islands are many, and
the people would have been glad to attend to any
earnest discussion of them by men of such distin
guished ability.
Whatever differences of opinion there may be in
relation to the statements made in the body of the
appeal, there ought. to be none with respect to the
object for which it was made, and which was thus
expressed: "Let every citizen study the facts and
make his conclusions known, combining with his
neighbor to influence Congress to stand true to the
principles of the declaration :by which this govern
ment was founded and under/ which it has grown so
great. The gravest danger our country has known
till now has come from a denial of those principles.
The incoming Congress is not yet committed to the
policy of incorporating the island peoples into our
systen#without rights. Let it resume its place in the
Government" in defense of the inalienable rights of
man." - :
The maintenance in undiminished vigor of all the
great principles for which our Government has stood
is unquestionably a duty imposed upon every patriot.
Those principles are probably not in danger', but it is
always well tq have men on guard to note with sus
picion everything that intimates danger and to sound
the alarm at once. ... Â¦, .
MRS. M'KINLEY'S THREE CHARMING
NIECES VISITING HER AT CANTON
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY; 10, 1901.
The New York Press asserts that the shirtwaist as
a dress for men is demoralizing, and as a proof it says:
"Refined women think it no disgrace to ride in the
same car with coatless men in negligee shirts, but on
Tuesday this liberty was quite overdone by three
swell lookers who rode in a One Hundred and Thirty
eighth street car in their undershirts."
The British public is said to be "hungry for jingo
poetry," but evidently starvation point is still a long
way off, for we have noted no cry for more verses
from the poet laureate.
Bowdoin University has conferred the degree of
LL. D. upon Sarah Orme Jewett, and now' the writers

AN INIQUITOUS SCHEME.
OX Sunday, June 30, The Call published an
elaborate analysis of the purport and effect
of Assembly constitutional amendment No.
28, which was adopted by the Legislature during the
closing hours of the session and which is to be. sub
mitted to the people it the next election. We revert
to it because the measure is of such an extraordinary
nature that the public should be fully warned and
the warning made impressive by repetition at once
without waiting for the approach of the election.
The proposed amendment contemplates the crea
tion of a commission of five persons clothed with
authority to regulate telegraph, telephone, water,
light, power, transportation, sleeping clr, express
companies and "other corporations." Thus the com
mission is to have authority to fix rates for about
everything that is supplied by a corporation. All
such powers hitherto vested in local governing bodies
of cities and of counties are to be- swept away. The
commission is to be everything. .
For the purpose of electing the members of the
commission the State is to be divided into five dis
tricts, from each of which a Commissioner is to be
chosen. His term of office is to be ten years, and
his salary $6000 a year. 'It is provided that no one
shall be a Commissioner who is "interested directly
or indirectly as a stockholder, creditor, agent, attor
ney, employe or otherwise in any of the corporations,
companies or business over which they have charge."

THIS PORT, NOT TO RETURN
THE army transport Buford leaves

hauled ' and will thea run between
New York and the Philippines.
The Buford arrived !^cre from the East
via Manila on March 13 last,' and has
only made one trip to the islands. Of all
the officers who came out,. in her, only
Captain K. V. Martens remains, and he
will take her back home. Chief Officer
\V H. Harstedt was formerly chief offi
cer of the Meade; Chief Engineer W. H.
Kelly was formerly chief of the Meade.
and First Assistant Engineer "\V. C. Pat
terson was formerly on the Hancock. Ma
jor S. B. Jones, the Buford's quartermas-
Charles Bristol, who was recently per
mitted to go free after a charge of burg
lary had been preferred against him, was
again in Judge ' Dunne's court yesterday
morning to answer to a charge of grand
larceny. In event a conviction fails on
Charles Bristol Again in Court.
Suits for divorce have been filed by Bon
nie Kroeckel against George Kroeckel for
infidelity; Fannie Zleger against ,Charles

against ' Helen Chamberlin for intenrper
ance; Samuel "Whaley against Rachael

against George Haker for failure to pro
vide; Emma Lermond against C. G. Ler
mond for cruelty, and Stewart McClure
against Francis B. McClure on statutory
grounds. . . '
Divorce Suits Filed.
From the other side, however, came op
position, and Lafe Pence, representing
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven, suggested that
the petition for final distribution filed
by the- .executors be taken up for
hearing in lieu of the other two and car
ried through to final judgment. Judge
Troutt, after much argument, concluded
that he would hear the petition then be
fore the court and, if necessity arose,
A spasm of economy was suddenly
switched" Into the Fair case yesterday
morning. Attorneys McEnerney and
Hayne, representing the executors of de
cedent's will, made the suggestion that for
the purpose of saving expense they were
of the opinion that the petition for partial
distribution filed by the children of the
deceased in 1S97 and the petition with the
same object in view filed in June of this
year be heard simultaneouslyâ joined on
issues of law and fact as it were.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, July 9.â Support for the mar
ket from the large banking interests and syn
dicates which seemed yesterday to have aban
doned it to* the effect of forced liquidation
worked a prompt transformation in specula
tive sentiment to-day. The opening dealings
disclosed that there was still urgent liquida
tion to be effected and some heavy blocks were
thrown upon the market at sharp concessions I
from last night's closing prices, but brokers
with supporting*' orders were present at the
same time and were bidding above the prices
at which others were letting stocks go. The
consequence was some wide openings in the
prices of the grangers. Pacific and South
western Etocks, on sales of 1000 to 3500 shaies
of each The average level of prices was car
ried to a point or more below last night, and
there were exceptional losses in Louisville of
3% in Baltimore and Ohio of 3U and in South
ern Pacific of 1%. United States Steel received
determined support from the outset, and al
though* the first offerings were of 10,000 shares,
the j>riee was held at last night's level. Dur
ing the rest of the day the market showed
steady recuperation and at times developed a
tone of etrength. The stocks which suffered
most acutely in yesterday's liquidation were j
most conspicuous in to-day's rally, notably |
St. Paul t Union Pacific, Missouri Pacific and
Atchison. The movement in these stocks was
eclipsed by that of Louisville, in which the
dealings were on a very large scale. The open
ing loss in this stock and the subsequent move
ment gave color to the supposition that It was
raided for the purpose of accumulating stocks.
In the late dealings it spurted to 110^, an
extreme rise of 7%. It closed with a net ga^n
of 2V4. The recovery in the other leaders from
theiow point ranged from 2 to 5. Some special
strength was shown by Illinois Central on the
declaration of the dividend and the decision
to issue new Uock. and the St." Louis and San
Francisco preferred on. the placing of stock
on a 4 per cent dividend basis. There was
no apparent cause for the recovery in the gen
eral list aside from the confidence inspired by
the evidence that powerful support was in the
market and that the ominous and urgent liqui
dation of yesterday was thereby checked. The
disquiet which was caused yesterday by the
mystery surrounding last -week's large decrease
in the cash reserves of the banks was dispelled
by the explanation that cash had been shipped
to Buffalo to provide against a possible run on
the banks there. Â¦
The bond market was moderjitely active, but
only a part of the list recovered in fympathy
with Etocks. Total sales, $2,950,000.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Spot rates are un
changed at 37s. 6d, usual ' options. The char
tered wheat 'fleet in port has a registered ton
nage of 18,625, against 25,000 tons on the same
date last year; disengaged, 8,268 tons, against
7,100; on the way to this port, 228.000 -tons,
asalnst 188,360.
WHEATâ The foreign markets were weak
and dull- and futurea at Paris and Liverpool
were lower.
Chicago opened weak on lower cables, then
recovered, only to fall back again. There
was a fair demand, but considerable liquida
tion. The interest in Wheat was 'secondary to
that in Corn and Oats, the two latter cereals
being excited and nervous, owing to bad crop
roports, as will be seen under their respective
heads below. Wheat has 'suffered no appre
ciable damage from the hot and dry weather
in the Bouthwest, as the harvest there is about
completed. Bradstreet's gives the following re
port of the supply on hand: East of the Rock
ies, a decrease of 1,498,000 bushels; Europe and
afloat, a decrease of 2,900,000 bushels; total de
crease 4,398,000 bushels. There is now a large
short interest in Wheat.
This market declined, both on and off call,

OATSâ The situation in the West and South
west is looking worse. The market Is strong
and excited at Chicago over crop damage re
ports. Texas is inquiring in the Northwest for
Oats, saying that the crop there . Is a failure,
and that it will have to look to Iowa for next
year's supply. Topeka reports that Oatsv have
been burned up in the fields by the hot wave,
that the pastures are brown and that there will
not be Hay enough lor local feeding.
All this Â¦ bad news has not yet affected thjs
market, though It may later on.- Local dealers
Fay that the output of this coast promises to
be ample, and report the market dull and easy,
though prices have not declined for some days.
The ceneral opinion is that the market will
strengthen later on, and that very fair prices
will rule in the fall. White, $1 35@1 45; Sur

CORN â As almost all the Corn now offering
comes from the East, this market Is wholly
ruled by, that,' and prices have again advanced
In sympathy with the conditions there. They
are grave. The Corn belt has been seriously
damaged by the late hot and dry weather, and
gloomy reports are being received. Advices .to
Bolton, de Ruyter & Co. say that the Chicago
market is excited and strong, and Topeka wires
that two-thirds of the Kansas crop is a fail
ure. Some may be cut for fodder, but will have
no ears. It does not seem as if Kansas could
haise 50,000,000 bushels, as- there has been no
general rain there since the middle of April.
The. Texas cro;> has failed and that State is
now beginning to draw on the north. St. Louis
sayÂ« that . . 55c per bushel is being paid
along Western lines. -Kansas City says
that Corn is being j bought at Minneapolis
for shipment south. A report from Devon,
Kaa., says: "Everything burning up. Corn
Is a complete failure. Hot winds are blowing."

CHICAGO, . July .9.â Wheat opened weak In
face of the strength in coarse grains and trad
ing was dull. The market improved somewhat
in^the first hour, . when after a' little reaction
from the opening figures corn and oats started
on a fresh advance. Taking of profits by
shorts caused a firmer feeling to succeed the
early weakness. â¢ September opened , %@%c
lower at 64c and advanced to 64%c on buying
by shorts. On selling by commission houses,
led by Phillips, prices declined to ' 63%c and
the close was U@%c lower.
Corn again attracted a large crowd and the
opening - was strong, with buyers largely in
the majority -and bidding %@lc above Satur
day's close. The continuation of hot, dry
weather was the cause of additional strength.
Corn closed lc higher at 49igHl9V4c.
Trading in. oats was active.* The dominating
bull factor was the prospect of curtailment In
the â¢ crop | occasioned by unfavorable weather.

The Continent showed an inclination to get
rid of consols and sold, but in the afternoon
there was a rally started by Amsterdam, which

less easy to obtain:
Cheese Is firm and higher, stocks being

PHOENIX, Ariz., July 9.â A storm
swept over Central Arizona to-day,
breaking the heated spell. In parts of the
Salt River Valley the rain was of suffi
cient volume to be of vast benefit to grain
and fruit crops, and in the mountains to
the north the storm was a hard one. In
the vicinity of Prescott and as far east
as Jerome and south to Mayer telephone
wires are down. No other damage has
been reported.

available man. In his capacity as prin
cipal of the Sacramento school he had
charge of the largest high school in the

an educator, and is due solely, to the ex
cellect record he has made as a member
of the high school faculty.
Tade was born in Sacramento twenty
five years ago and has resided the greater
part of his life in this city.
Tade was graduated from the University
of California with the class of '97. He was
a well-known and "popular student and a

PRETTY Grace Fraser sailed away
on^he Doric yesterday to meet in
Hongkong and then to wed ' the
man who has won he.r heart. Al
bert L. Gasquoine, booking agent
at Hongkong for the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, is the lucky fellow, and
just as soon as Miss Fraser reaches Hong
kong the wedding bells will ring out for
the happy young people. t]
The wedding of Miss Fraser and Gas
quoine will be the concluding chapter Of
a ' delightful, romance, the opening of
which was played in the branch telephons
office on Geary street. Miss Fraser la a
hello girl. For some time she had charge
of the Geary-street office, but lately has
had at the Bush-street office an ear for
all complaints, when subscribers were
pleased to call up 9-10.
It was, however, while looking after the
fortune of the Geary-street branch that
Miss Fraser met Gasquoine. He was on
his. way to his home in New York after
serving a metropolitan newspaper as war
correspondent in South Africa and in
Cuba. When Gaaquolne met the beautiful
telephone girl he abandoned all thoughts
of returning East, and settled in this city
and engaged in the fascinating pastime
of wooing' and winning the object of his
affections. It was about this time that
Mr. Schwerin decided that Gasquoine was
just the man , he wanted for Hongkong,
and when the war correspondent sailed
for the Orient Grace Fraser had promised
to follow him there and make him the
happiest of men.
"With Miss Fraser on her Far Eastern
trip goes a trunk full of wedding finery.
Carefully packed in it is a blue etamine
Miss Fraser's friends were all down to
the dock yesterday morning to saygood
by to her. They filled her cabin with
choicest blossoms and sang songs and
waved farewell until the departing ship
was lost to sight. - .
It will be some time before Grace
Fraser's family and friends see her again.
Mr. Gasquoine will have . to remain in
Hongkong until February. 1903. After
that date he, has arranged to take his
young wife on an extended bridal tr ip
that will include a visit to all the Euro
pean capitals and. a trip to Aus
tralia. Before finally settling down in
New York the young couple will come on
a visit to this city. â¢ Â¦
Miss Fraser is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. L. C. Fraser of 192S Larkin street.
She has hosts of friends in this city whose
good wishes follow her to her new home.

The fire started on the roof and was
caused by sparks from the cupola. Fifty
men were at work in the place at tha
time on rush orders.
The timbers of the roof made good food
for the flames, which spread with such
rapidity that inside of half an hour only
the corrugated walls of the structure
were standing, and they were twisted and
otherwise damaged by the roof and belt

Many valuable patterns were destroyed,

HER LITTLE PLAYMATES '
ACT AS PALLBEARERS
Six little girls in white yesterday placed
garlands on the newly made grave of lit
tle Margaret Hartwell. the unfortunate
girl who was shot on July 4 by ex-Police
man Robert J. Wilson. The floral tributes
and the tears of the bereft parent and tho
playmates of the innocent victim mingled
on the turf that covered the simple coffin
of the girl. ,:^>.
As the body of the child was lowered
into the grave the mother was beside her
self with grief. Her lamentations affected
every one and handkerchiefs were moist
ened with the tears that were shed.
The funeral of "Maggie." as she was
endearingly called by her playmates, waa
a simple one. The white hearse and whitÂ»
horses drew up before the saddened home
at 206 Shipley street. But half a dozen
carriages were necessary to hold the
murners and their friends. The floral
pieces that decked the little coffin were
the tokens of neighbors and schoolmates.
Agnes Tobin. Laura Chessman. Ldllle
Holman. Alice Holman, Aggie Gagan and
Elsie Camolorie. schoolmates and her
companions in play, were the pallbearers.
These little girls wore white dresses and,
wreaths on their heads. There was little
ceremony at the house. Scores of neigh
bors entered the room in which the girl
lay In eternal sleep, sympathizing with
the -bereft parent and taking a last look
at the remains.
The funeral cortege moved to St. Pat
rick's Church, where prayers were said
over the body by the Rev. Father O'Hara.
The Interment was at Holy Cross Ceme

Journeymen Butchers' Union No. 115
failed to hold a meeting last night. Steps
are being taken by the labor leaders to
segregate the different branches of the
trade. Until the question of the union card
and restaurants is settled no definite ac
tion will be taken. The union originally
numbered \ 1500 members. The beneficial
organization, composed of practically the
same people, remains Intact, and is in a
flourishing 'condition. *?< : / TT ,
Tobacco Workers International Union
No. 74 has installed the following officers:
Bakers reported that the Co-operative bakery
is gaining customers for union label bread.
The Vienna Model Bakery, 40 Kearny street,
and the Tivoll Cafe are working bakers severi
days a week. All union men are asked to de
mand union label bread. The co-operative
bakery is already on a paying basis.
The cooks and waiters report that all the
butchers in town, both wholesale . and retail, Â¦
with one solitary exception, threaten to shut
off supplies of meat for ninety days if the
union cards are not immediately taken out of
the restaurant windows. The one exception
is Chris Merchant, who Is getting a supply of
meat from outside sources. . He is willing to
supply' union restaurants with meat at the
same prices as non-union butchers/' The Res
taurant Keepers' Association is badly demor
alized and some of the members are taking
down and replacing the union card every other
day. Retail butchers are beginning to quarrel
among themselves, as they are stealing one
another's customers. Cooks and waiters ex
pect an early victory.
Brewers report that I they expect to Inaugu
rate an eight-hour work day In San . Fran

Milk wagon drivers ask union men and wives
to ask for union cards.
The election of officers of the Retail Trades
Council will be held on Tuesday, July 23..
After' the meeting of the Retail Trad
ers' Council, President Andre issued the
following statement:
Outside Supply of Heat.
To shave, trim the beard or cut the hair
of any person for hire or reward received . by
the person performing such services or any
other person, shall bs construed as practicing
the occupation of barber .within the meaning
of the act.
Whether it will be necessary for the
members of the Board of Examiners to
examine the Chinese barbers is a question
the Attorney General will be asked to
decide.
Carpenters' Union No. 483 has indorsed
the project of issuing a weekly paper de
voted to labor interests under the aus
pices of the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil. An additional . donation of $50 has
been made to the fund for the benefit of
the strikers. Nine members were initi
ated and twenty-five applications filed.
Secretary Russell I. Wisler of the local
Machinists' Union went to Vallejo last
night to confer -with the union located in
that place and to seek financial assistance.
;He expressed satisfaction before his de
parture at additional 1 telegrams received
from Eastern points.
' Against a backsliding member -both the
journeymen and Master Barbers' Associ
ation are waging a war. Pickets are out,
and. their energies are concentrated
against. the proprietor of â¢ the shop, who
was among the early ones who agreed to
raise the price of shaving from 10 cents
to 15 cents. He has now returned to his
old 'price, and his place on Fourth street
near Mission has been declared unfair.
With the exception of a few scattered
shops In the districts where the' poorest
classes of people live, the new schedule
was accepted. When Goldstein,' the pro
prietor of the boycotted shop, announced
that he would withdraw from the union
agreement, resume his old prices and re
turn his card, energetic action was at
once determined upon. A meeting of the
executive committee of the Journeymen
Barbers' Union and the Master Barbers'
Association was held yesterday afternoon
at the headquarters in the Emma Spreck
els building. The assistance of the State
Board of Barber Examiners was called
for and promptly granted.
One of the most serious charges made
against the Fourth street proprietor is
that his place is a sort of dumping ground
for the graduates of barber colleges. An
investigation is to be made of this asser
tion, and his employes cited to appear
before the State Board of Barber Ex
aminers for examination as to their qual
ifications. A penalty of fine or imprison
ment, or both, is a part of the law gov
erning the beard for any barber practicing
without certificate of the State Board of
Barber Examiners. - President Wray of
the Journeymen Barbers' Union has the
investigation in hand.
â¢ Considerable activity is being manifest
ed in the rooms of the State Board of
Barber Examiners. Certificates are being
issued as rapidly as possible. A great
number of men ami several women were
in line all through the day, and more
than 500 certificates were Issued. Among
those who received certificates were K.
Ondo and wife, both Japanese. They con
duct a shop on Taylor street. To Mrs.
Ondo belongs the distinction of being the
first female barber to practice in this city,
and as she has had considerable experi
ence the examiners cheerfully gran ted. her
the requisite papers to continue her work.
The State Board of Barber Examiners
is in a dilemma. There is a large num
ber of barbers in Chinatown who have
only their own countrymen as customers.
What canstitues a barber is set forth, in
section 15 of the tonsorial statute as fol
lows: i

This in substance Is the basis of the
Â¦perjury charges that the District Attor
ney may bring against the men named.
The public is highly Incensed over the
failure of the Jury to convict a man who
iÂ« dpemed guilty without a doubt and the
District Attorney may be forced by the
strong sentiment to bring the charges,
ovm to the detriment of the second trial.
SAN JOSE, July 9.â Five persons may
have to ajiswer to a charge of perjury as
a result of the failure of the Jury to con
vict in the recent murder trial of High
binder Lee Look. Ex-Mayor Kocn, who
was one of the Jurors, and four witnesses
for the defense â Russo. Bias, Messinna
and Pinellaâ are under suspicion and Dis
trict Attorney Campbell made the state
ment openly this evening that if charges
were not brought it would not be be
cause there was lack of evidence, but
from a desire on the part of the office to
do naught that would prejudice the sec
ond trial of the case, which will com
mence next Monday.
Valentine Koch swore under examina
tion that he knew nothing: and had heard
nothing concerning the trial. There are
three responsible persons who stand
ready to swear that he was in the Jus
tices' Court room while the preliminary
trial was going on and he has been forced
to a confession of the fact himself. In
rebuttal he says he did not know it was
the same case.
The four Italians tola several persons
immediately after the trial that they
ran away as soon as the shooting began
They went on to the stand and testified
that they witnessed the 6hooting and that
the accused was defending the murdered
man instead of shnoting at him.

Along with the discussion of the proper
treatment for officials said to be respon
sible for the condition will now go con
sideration of measures for the restoration
of the rank to its former basis. A special
assessment on insured members and an
increase in the monthly payments on In
surance were said to be probable by man
btrs of the Supreme Lodge before they
went into session. The meeting will con
tinue three days, or possibly longer, it is
thought.
CHICAGO. July 9.â As a result of the
report of the officers and six members of
the board of control of the endowment :
rank of the Knights of "Pythias, it is said
a former president of the board will lose
his membership. It is also said that pro- ,
feedings on criminal charges will be in- !
Ftituted against three former members of
the beard of control. :
When the forenoon session was con- :
eluded to-day one of the members of the
investigation board declared that this ac
tion would probably be taken before night.
It is said that the report submitted to
day shows that of the half million dol
lars missing a considerable portion was
disT-csed of unlawfully..
The report considered this forenoon was
signed by six members of the board of
cor.trol and by officers cf the order. The
seventh member of the board, who was
absent, is J. A. Hlcsey. This report also
shows the findings of the insurance de
partments of Illinois, Kansas and Con
necticut*
ThtT Supreme Lodge met in special ses
Â¦ s!on. The subject discussed was "in
judicious handling of the funds of the
endowment rank of the order." It is said
$500,000. the entire surplus of the endow
ment rank, has been so badly handled
during the past few years that it is un
available for use, except at a great sac
rifice. Meanwhile, the death rate has in
creased to such an extent that the rank
5s S400.000 behind on death claims.

BALFOUR. GUTHRIE & CO., Gen. AÂ«ent&The California Petroleum Miners' Association
is quasi-public ln Its character and is always
plad to give information, such as It has, about
the different oil companies ln the State.
If investors in oil lands and oil stocks would
take the trouble of making inquiries at the
office of the California Petroleum Miners' As
sociation before making investments as to the
standing of the companies we would probably
hear less of the kind of fake concerns such
as the "Standard Oil Promotion and Invest
ment Company."
Â¦ Many times since then we have received let
ters from different parts of the State asking us
as to their financial ability, which letters we
have always answered by saying we know
nothing about them and did not indorse them.
This company made application last January
to become a member of the California Petro
leum Miners' Association and was rejected, as
we did not believe them to be a legitimate or
ganization commanding the respect' of in
vestors. -
I notice ln this morning's Call an account
of the disappearance of the promoters of the
"Standard Oil Promotion and Investment Com
pany."
Secretary Deane of the California Pe
troleum Miners' Association has ad
dressed the followingrfetter to The Call:
of the age. I have" seen the checks which
were sent ln payment for these magazine
and newspaper articles. Balliet secured
possession of the White Swan Mine ln
Oregon by purchasing liens, on the prop
erty and securing a Sheriff's deed on fore
closure. Before the time expired ln which
the property could be redeemed, Balliet
was selling- stock all over the country. Ha
bonded the Gold Ridge Mine, some dls
tai ce from the White Swan, the owners
tielng In Salt Lake. He could not make
the first payment of- $10,000 on the -bond
and had another party .rebond it. for hin>.
The two mining 1 properties i were -incor
porated as the "White Swan Mines Com
pany, Limited. The company was incor
porated for a million and a quarter-dol
lars. Balliet has '600,000 of . \the . shares.
There will be a big row when the direc
tors meet. It is estimated that he has re
ceived more than $100,000 from the sale of
stock and about $8000 has been spent In
improving the property of the company.
The natural question arises as to where
all the money has gone. Balliet keeps no
bocks, and his accounts 'are made up from
his check and bank books. Thomes. who
is advertised as secretary of some of Bal
liet's companies, has been used as a figure
head by Balliet. He has nothing to do
with the business of the offices where
Balliet operates. Miss A. D. Young opens
all the mail and Thomes' personal mail is
kept" separate for him.
"As regards the Diamond Oil Company,
stcck of which was advertised as being
for sale by 'A. D. Young,' in Balliet's of
fices, Balliet and the man who owned
some of. the stock made a contract by
which BaJliet was to sell it. The man
Balliet produced as being the 'Young'
mentioned in the advertisements had
nothing to do with the transaction."
Captain Seymour "Would Prosecute.
The expose of the swindle carried on by
Chaney and Ewlng ln operating the
"Standard Oil Promotion and Develop
ment Company" has called the attention
of Captain of Detectives Seymour to the
bogus oil companies in the State. Cap
tain Seymour says he would like to prose
cute some of the swindlers If some of
their dupes would come to the front and
swear to -complaints. x

the assignment cf the case to this depart
ment, but, In any event the commission
wants a transfer, on the, ground "that
the court is biased."
On the other hand; the members of the
departmentâ the - fire fighters who would
see the old association continue in its
present prosperous condition and are not
anxious to be absolutely dominated by the
board and a'new organization established
âassert that the Fire Commission wants
a transfer fromJJudge Cook's department
because the commission "is aware that
Judge Cook will give the plaintiff a square
deal."
Â¦Under, the modified code,, however, Judge
Cook has no alternative but to order the
transfer of the case. Then when It is re
assigned the plaintiff will have his oppor
tunity to file an affidavit for another
transfer, hence it is probable that the
third Judge on the list will try the case
that Â¦ will : determine whether or : not Â¦ the
commission shalr direct the fraternal af
fairs of its subordinate or whether they
will be permitted to rule themselves when
off duty and outside the jurisdiction of
their employers. ' â¢ TS
Municipal Extension Law Valid;
Â¦ The Supreme Court yesterday ' affirmed
the right of Los Angeles to extend the
city limits. The suit -was brought about
by the Attorney General and J. W. Skel
ton, a taxpayer of Los^ Angeles, merely
to test the validity of the new law apply

Here's politics! The Board of Fire Com

that George F. Maxwell's suit to restrain
the commission from interfering with the
conduct of the San Francisco Fire'"De

signed to Judge Cook's department of the

department deals generally with criminal

EAILWAY STATIONS THBONGED
CHICAGO, July 9.â Judging from the
appearance of the Chicago railway sta
tions to-day the. majority of the Epworth
Leaguers in America passed through here
on the way to San Francisco to atten'l
the fifth international convention. Every
Eastern line brought hundreds of them
to the city, and every Western road
hurried them out again on the way to the
Golden Gate.
The first special to arrive to-day was
a Wabash train bearing 200 or more ex
cursionists from the territory tributary to
that line. At 9 o'clock the Union station
began to fill and overflow with Pennsyl
vania, New York and Ohio Leaguers.
Four sections arrived there between 9
and 11 o'clock and each carried a hundred
or more passengers. Of these 400 ex
cursionists-about 330 carried : cameras,
loaded and ready to be turned upon
everything of scenic interest from the
Mormon Tabernacle to the Yosemite
Falls. Â¦ ' - : '
Two hundred.New Yorkers arrived over
the Michigan Central this afternoon and
a large delegation from Boston and New
England reached the Lake Shore station
at 5:30 o'clock. Six carloads of Canadians
from Toronto and thereabouts arrived in
time to go out at midnight with hundreds
of Chicagcans on the Epworth League
special of the Northwestern road.
One of the best trains to depart from
this point was tho'Rock River -and Cen
tral Illinois confidence special on the Chi
cago, Burlington and Quincy.
The passenger agents Â» estimated that
fully 2000 excursionists went through Chi
cago en route to San Francisco.

bunting- Â¦will also be used to render them
more attractive. The Maltese cross,
which 'is the universal symbol of the
league, is to be made prominent. The
American and British flags and Epworth
League pennants are to surround the en
tire exterior o5? the building. â¢_
Visitors Will Go to San' Jose. :
The outside towns are working hard to
arrange receptions for the delegates.
"Train sections" will greet the incoming
excursionists at every station through
which the "specials" are to pass. I Many
additional trips have also been arranged
for the leaguers, to take place immedi
ately after the convention. On July 25 and
26 large numbers of the visitors are to go
to San Jose. District President Elgin C.
Hurlbert of the league states that Santa
Clara County plans to give them a glori
ous welcome. A programme of entertain
ment has been arranged Â¦which will con
sist of drives, banquets and a great open
air concert. Lick Observatory will be of
great interest to the visitors and all will
be given an opportunity to visit it. A six
day trip to Yosemite at reduced rates will
doubtless attract many. Other excursions
will be given to embrace short visits to
Pacific Grove, Del Monte, Monterey,
Santa Cruz, Mount Hamilton, Palo Alto,
Mount Tamalpais, the Geysers, Big Trees
and Napa and Sonoma valleys. The rail
roads also offer special rates to Alaskan
points and places of interest throughout
the West. .
Subscriptions Come in Slowly.
Great apprehension is felt in the matter
of the collection of funds for the conven
tion. Subscriptions are for comparatively
small amounts and come in slowly., Kner
getic canvassers are af work and no stone
will be left unturned to raise, the money
which is necessary for the success of the
convention. The sum which was estimated
to be adequate to defray general expenses
is $25,000. I .â¢
Of this amount the finance committee
reports the receipt of only $13,135, of which
the following subscriptions were made
yesterday: ;";â¢Â¦ -

On account of. the premature arrival of
more than a 'thousand Epworth League
delegates, the entertainment and regis
tration committees have decided to hold
an impromptu reception this morning at
10 o'clock in the Mechanics' Pavilion. The
affair will be strictly Informal and no spe
cial programme has been arranged for the
occasion. At the reception only visiting
delegates ; will be registered. The regis-
and step* are to be taken to prevent the
use of .the mails for fraudulent purposes.
Last month the postal authorities
stopped the heavy mail of Letson Bal
llet, who has widely advertised himself as
a mining: king, . owner of street car linea,
electric light works and newspapers.
Balliet holds forth In a suite of offices
at 5GS California street and the postal au
thorities are to be asked to again make
an Investigation of his method of doing
business.. The Federal Grand Jury in
Des Modnes, Iowa, recently indicted Bal
liet for using the mails x for. fraudulent
purposes and the case has not yet been
disposed of.
A visit made to Balllet's offices, occupy
ing twelve rooms, show that a vast busi
ness is being done. Ten typewriters' are
engaged from early morn till late at night
answering the people, all over thÂ© coun
try, who are sending money to Balliet for
investment after reading the glowing ac
counts in certain newspapers and maga
zines of his swift rise to fortune and the
many enterprises he is connected with.
The White Swan Mines Company,
Limited, the San Francisco Mining Com
pany, thÂ© Pacific Oil Company and the
Diamond Oil Company are the enter
prises advertised tar and wide as doing
business in the rooms occupied by Bal
liet at 508 California street.
Heavily Advertised in East.
A recent issue of a Boston newspaper
contained six columns of advertising and
reading matter of companies operated
from Balliet 1 8 rooms. Â¦
The Pacific Oil Company was written
up as being one of the great oil companies
j of California, situated in the Arroyo
Honda district of the San Joaquln Val
ley. F. B. Thomes was mentioned as
secretary, to whom all would-be investors
should send communications And tele
grams. , '
The Diamond Oil Company was written
up for a full column as one of the finest
oil properties in the McKittrick district
and "investors were asked to address "A.
r>. Young, room 8,-608 California- street,
San Francisco." v x ..-Â¦-.
Balliet himself was written up for two
columns as one of the wealthy mining
kings and oil experts of the Pacific Coast
and a vivid account given of his rapid rise
to wealth in a few years. -
Investigation made yesterday showed
that Balliet was the president of the San
Francisco Mining 1 .Company and the Pa
cific Oil Company and that he had been
duly elected to those offices. The San
Francisco Mining Company was incor
porated for the purpose of working the
Josephine mine in El Dorado County.
The mine was formerly owned by J. M.
Nougues, an attorney of this city, who
sought the aid. of Balliet to exploit the
same on the market, knowing Balliet's
"fame" as a promoter.
The Pacific Oil Company owns as assets
some patented land in Lower California,
located by J. M. Nougues, and 4000 acxes
of land in the Arroyo Honda district, lo
cated by W. A. Desborough.
The directors of the San Francisco Min
,ing Company are Balliet, president: J. M.
ICougues Sr., vice president; F. â¢ B.
Thomes, secretary; S. H. Rowland, treas
urer, and J. M. Nougues Jr., director.
Miss Young Gets All Mail.
The Pacific- Oil Company has BalHet
as president, F. B. Thomes as treasurer
and secretary, J. M. Nougues Jr. and W.
A. Desbrough as directors. The Pacific
Oil Company had the sum of $7 subscribed
-by the promoters for one share each, and
this sum was returned to them by their
own order.
The Diamond Oil Company claims to
have 640 acres of oil land in the McKit
trick district; with welis down to a great
depth. The officers of this company are
E. D. Berri, president; Philip Lawrence,
vice-president; M. M. Carothers, secre
Â¦When Balliet was asked yesterday to ex
plain his connection with the companies
of which he was president, he stated that
he had been elected president during his
absence and without his knowledge or
consent.
Regarding the Diamond Oil Company
and "A. D. Young." to whom all orders
should be sent, according to the advertise
ment in the Eastern papers, an explana
tion was made by Balliet that he did not
know of any one of that name in his of
fices and knew nothing about the com
pany. ' â¢ â¢ . â¢
It is known, however, that the "A. D.
Young" advertised in connection with the
Diamond Oil Company is Miss Alice D.
Young, a stenographer In suite
of offices, who attends to the receipt of
all mail that comes addressed to the of
fices.
Repudiated by the Nougueses.
Balliet changed his mind after a few
minute* and produced "Mr. Young." He
brought into. the, room a man named Carl
Young, who acts as advertising solicitor
for an Eastern newspaper. Young assept
ed that he had inserted the glowing ad
vertisement about the Diamond Oil Com
pany and that he was simply acting as an
agent for a man who owned 12,500 shares
of stock in the company.
The Diamond Oil Company was recently
exposed in a local oil journal as being far
from what it claimed to be.
Attorney Nougues and his son. who se
cured the assistance of Balliet to exploit
the Josephine mine in El Dorado County
and also their land in Lower' California
for the Pacific Oil Company, have Balliet's
resignation from their companies. They
do~ not countenance Balliet's methods of
glowing circulars ; and write-ups in East
ern papers as to the properties in question.
.Balllet's explanations as to his proposed
severance from the two companies are
that he is too busy to attend to their af
fairs. He stated yesterday that he had
telegraphed East to a Boston newspaper
to withdraw his name from the advertise
ments of the companies in' question.
Said to -Have Received $100,000.
A- former associate of Balliet describes
him as a "hot air artist," and in speak
ing recently of his methods of business,
said: * . - .
"Balliet Is not what he claims to be.
He boasts that the way to make money-
Js to make the man. For that purpose he
has had himself written up all over the
country as one of the greatest financiers

fncJTn That the Animzls Are Injuri-

The "United States Board of Fish Com-
Tnissioiiers has taken steps to finally de-
termtae -whether the sea lions of the Pa
cific Coast are dangerous to the fishing in
terests. The State board' at one time re
ceived permission to kill sea lions and
then, on the advice of Eastern experts,
the permission was withdrawn. The board
was persuaded that great injuries were
being done to the fish in nearby waters
and an urgent aopeal for an investiga
tion -was sent to Washington.
The TTnited Slates Kish Commission has

might be alleged. By request from the
T"ish Commission. Charles H. Gilbert of
Stanford 'University has -recommended R.
E. Snodgrass for the position. This com
mittee will make a complete investigation
of the subject and will ultimately decide
the much debated question.
THE first delegates to the Epworth
League convention arrived In
Francisco last night on the East
ern overland train. They hail
from Decatur. Illinois, and start
ed on the official excursion from Kansas
j City last Saturday. Immediately on their
arrival they were greeted by members of
\ the reception committee and escorted to
the quarters for which they had previous
ly arranged. More delegates will arrive
to-day and on each succeeding day till
the opening of the convention. The rush
cf visitors, however, will not occur until
the first of next week, when many thou
sands will arrive on the special trains.
Last night the report ' came from Chi
cago that a' great army of delegates had
Just passed through that city. Their cars
were gaily decorated in red and white
and when they crowded out into the rail
way stations it is stated that they
seemed to number millions.
The railroads are preparing to handle
the immense passenger trafflo' in a sys
tematic manner. Profiting from their ex
perience with the Christian Endeavor
convention, particular attention will be
given to the care of baggage. Extra fer
ry-boats will be used to carry the trunks
and when they arrive they will be dis
tributed so that the owners may get them
at a moment's notice. Several transfer
companies will handle i the baggage after
it arrives here. .
The Rio Grande Railroad will turn over
more than forty large excursion trains
to the Southern Pacific aOOgtten within
two days. Careful arrangements have
been made that there ahall be no delay
In spite of the great amount of unusual
travel. Eating- pavilions for the excur
sionists have lwen erected all along the
line so that crowding and discomfort may
be avoided. To guard against accidents,
all trains leaving- Ogden -will be run on
the block system.
The movement toward the convention
from the ' South started yesterday, and
to-day a party leaves Toronto, Canada,
for San Francisco. Many of the parties
contemplate stops at some of the larger
cities on the way. Salt Lake City is
making a special endeavor to induce the
delegates to visit points of interes; in
that section. . FTee entertainment is pro
vided for them and some of the leading
speakers for the convention will -make ad
dresses from the pulpits of the Utah capi
tal.
Decorating the Pavilion.
"Work at Mechanics* Pavilion is belns
pushed forward rapidly. The canopv, in
Epworth .League colors, is in place. Tlie
organ is erected and Is being tuned at
night when the building is free from the
noise occasionad by the workmen. Many
of the booths on the Grove-street side of
the Pavilion, where the* great exhibit is
to be held/are already in process of deco
ration. The Humboldt County people
have brought the bark of an immense
redwood and put it together in such a
manner that Xt cannot be distinguished
from a section of a genuine 1 tree. The
Santa Fe ticket office is a unique repre
sentation of an old Spanish mission, with
colonnades, arches and other antique fea
tures. According to the terms of the con
tract, everything will be in order on Sat
urday, and the headquarters of the
league will then be moved from the
Toung Men's Christian Association build
ing to the Pavilion.
The officials in charge of arrangements
have supplied headquarters with every
convenience. A special postofQce for dele
gates has been promised bv the Govern
ment authorities. Free information and
guides will be furnished to thoso who
may so desire. An emergency hospital is
to be situated close at hand. Chief Sulli
van of the Fire Department has assigned
a special engine for the Pavilion and reg
ular firemen and substitutes have been
appointed to operate it in case of need. â¢
All exhibitcrs are at work getting their
displays into shape for the . convention.
Floral arches are to be placed over the
booths and quantities of gay colored
