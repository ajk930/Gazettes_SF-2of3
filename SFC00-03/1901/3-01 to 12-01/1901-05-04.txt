Buffington. He and Dunham had gone
swimming together, and he. had seen on
the murderer's left foot a deep scar.. Crill
removed his shoe for BufBngton and tho
absence of the scar convinced him that
"Crill is Crill." â¢
Against these to-day were Miss Willetta
"Worthington. P. J. Browning and a couple
of others," who believe the manls v Dun
liam.
Another link tending to establish Crill's
identity came In the shape of -a letter to
Assessor Spitzer from Mrs. Helen' Furman
of Sea Bright, Santa Cruz County. She
says: "> : > v i
I resided in Pueblo, Colorado, for several
years.. Charles Crill edited a. newspaper there
called, I think, the Bessemer News/ | My
daughters worked for a short time in his:of
fice and I met him frequently. The picture
In the papers is a striking' likeness. His wife
was formerly Dora Schreiber. and her broth
ers and father conducted an orchestra which
was quite famous In the town. ,. â¢
I heard that Mr. Crill had been a drunkard
and had taken the gold'' cure about the time
we knew him. in- 'S3 I should .say. He was
very nervous at that- time, wore about the
same kind of hat as In the Â« picture, kept il
on in the office while talking to ladles and
had a habit of pushing it back on his head..
I doubt if he would remember at once my
daughters or myself, but we distinctly re
member him and his young wife and little boy.
I must think the unfortunate . man accused
of the crime is. Mr. Crill of Pueblo and -that
he Is entirely Innocent. . *
The reception Crill is now enjoying will
be stopped shortly. The Sheriff's office
is getting tired of It and will put Crill
Into a cell; When this occurs Crill will
demand- his release. Then will come. the
showdown and Crill must expose his hand.
He has already consulted an attorney.
Nickel Library Rumors.' \ v
One of the. wildest of the yarns finding
circulation on the street is tha$ Dunham
met Crill. after leaving here, learned his
life history, killed him and has taken up
the. life of Crill. v - -
Sheriff Langford admits he is puzzled.
He declares Crill contradicts himself. At
one time while on the train, when Cnll
awoke, Langford thrust a picture of Dun
ham ar.d his wife in front of Crill and
tears filled the man's eyes. . When offered
the" picture again, Crill said he had seen
all he wanted of It. Â«.
Crill said to-night that he would be-iden
tified to-morrow by a .Mrs. J. A. Fisher,
who knew him at FJagg Station before
her marriage. She now resides here. Her
husband called at the jail this evening
and talked with Crill. The suspect says
he is getting tired of jail life. Â¦
SUSPECT CRILL MAKES
DUPES OF H A WKSH A WS
Purposely Pretends to Be Dunham, Borrows
Money of Would-Be Captor and Gains
Notoriety and a Free Trip to California
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May Sâ While a great ma
jority of those who knew James C. Dun
ham, the murderer of the McClincys, de-'
clare Crill is not the fugitive, Sheriff
Langford and Greiner are loth to give in
and grasp at each bit of identification
Â¦evidence as a drowning man would at a
straw. Many who knew Dunham" most
Intimately do not hesitate to say Crill is
not the man. The, little bits of informa
tion , gf ven about himself by Crill are be
ing substantiated.
Crill is probably an adventurer and a
laker. Resembling Dunham closely, he
evidently "tumbled" to the fact .Jhat
(xreiner was after him. He saw In this
a chance to play the detective. Money
was borrowed from Greiner. This is
proved by letters in the possession of
Greiner. To do this Crill Intimated that
he was Dunham. When Crill found him
self under arrest he evidently concluded to
set some advertising out of the scheme.
All along he has made no attempt to
identify himself, but has forced the bur
den of this proof on the officers. When
he gets out of jail he will turn the noto
riety he has attracted to good account.
This he practically admits.
Bigamist or Taker.
Now that Charles F. Crill is not mur
derer Dunham, the people are wondering
what there is In the man's career that he
is hiding. The general belief is that he
is a too- much married manâ in fact, a
bigamist. Crill will throw no light on
this subject. Mrs. Crill. at Cripple Creek,
the dispatches state, was never divorced,
and Crill's story that he was divorced in
Salt Lake in 1897 is denied. He is either
a bigamist or else he never married Mrs.
Crill No. 2.
Mrs. Marv Statler, *who knew Dunham
well and ate dinner with him every day ;
for six weeks a few months before the
murder, declared to-day that Crill was
not Dunham. She said . he possessed but :
slight resemblance to the murderer. Sen
ator Morehouse had acted as attorney for
Dunham and he. too, is positive the
wrong man is in custody. A. B. Post,
cashier of the Garden City Bank, knew
Dunham and he Is the man who received
the fugitive's strong box containing $900
just before the crime. After sizing up
Crill he said he was not Dunham. Mrs.
Parker, who nursed Mrs. Dunham when
their baby was born, and John Klink of
Campbell were equally positive Crill is
not Dunham. .

some of them despite their disguises, but
their names were withheld until they
could be placed under arrest.
The . elder Sellers was badly scarred
about the face and hands when seen to
day and he was sore from the whipping
he had received. He said the men were
disguised by having barley sacks tied
over their heads.
, The motive for the assault on Seliera
and his sons was the belief that Sellers
was responsible for Special Agent Bors
tadt being In the vicinity investigating
timber-cutting on Government land. Many
of the people living near Zebra regard
Sellers as the one who gave Information
to the Government. In consequence of the
evidence supplied many arrests for tres

have been trespassing vowed vengeance
and last night's assault followed.

MADBRA, May 3.â William Sellers, who
lives ' near Zebra, was dragged from his
bed last night, tied to a tree and- whip
ped by masked men. His two . sons.
Alonzo\ and Claude, were tied hand and'
foot | and whipped. Around the neck of
the younger, a -boy 11 years of age, , a
hair rope was placed by one of the mask
ers,, who pulled the rope tight and nearly
strangled the. little fellow. The skin 1 on
the lad's neck was badly abrased. Father
and ; sons were 1 terribly bruised by the
whipping they received. After beating
the three and keeping them tied outside
! their house^ in the night air for three
.hours the masked men took them to a
cow trail about three miles away. and or
dered them to get out of the country,;
telling them that if they remained there
until 10 o'clock to-day they would be
killed. â¢ /
Sellers and his sons came to town to
day with George Borstadt. special agent
of the General Land Office, who has been
in the hills for the last four weeks Inves

tion during- the~- day. V.Th.e ' featpre of' his
farewell: letter,' published exclusively in
this morning's CaU.Lwhlch most: excited
comment was" the .sentence, "I am;not; re
sponsible, .but others 1 are." 7 At first' this
was resjarded*as ah indication' that! the/e
was someihiddenVinotive for the .'act; but
this theory -has not-'' been seriously Tenter-,
tained and '.the Â¦ common; Interpretation
now â¢ Riven^ is r,that ? lri^ his Etate-yofynieV
ancholia he felt-' some measure . of!'reselit
ment toward those who had encouraged
him in a/course which was . le^'dinsr him
to his doom. . A friend who walked 1 -, home
with Lelong in . the early part of the
evening declares that' he left him. in. a
cheerful mood, but there is no disputing
the fact that for some weeks past he has
been laboring under depression produced
by irregular habits and loss of sleep, and
those who know him best assert that his
suicide was prompted by the condition of
mind which resulted from, these causes. :
Lelong was held in high regard in . Sac
ramento and, for that matter,, through
out the State, not only because of his sin
gularly amiable qualities but because of
his profound learning in, all branches of
horticulture. His counsel was soueht.and
followed by orchardlsts throughout . the
State. He is survived by a widow and
young son, who had earned for themselves
a place in the regard of a wide circle hero.
That Lelong planned his suicide.delib
erately is proved not only by the presence
of the farewell letter in his pocket but
by the fact that he had selected- for .the
commission of;the-deed.'a spot in Capitol
Park-.which was not '.only quiet but
which was well lighted and would permit
the prompt -discovery of -his body. â¢' v

cluding United States Senators, Congressmen.
Governors and distinguished persons from all
parts of the world. > '
During the week that the Presidsnt will re
main with us many thousands of people will
flock to the eity to witness the launching of
the Ohio, which will be unquestionably an
other glory for our city, an honor to the offi
cers of the Union Iron Works and a credit
to the unexcelled skill of the mechanics of
San Francisco. .
This is the first time in thÂ© history of our
city that we will have the pleasure of enjoying
the presence of the President with his Cabinet
and so many Government officials.
The decorating committee will attend to the
illumination by electric light* of some of the
principal streets of the city, but we rely upon
the patriotism of the residents of San Fran
cisco to tastefully decorate their own prem
ises and give our visitors California' 3 .pro
verbial warm welcome. .
Let "Old Glory." the emblem of one of the
greatest and most progressive nation* on Â«arth,
wave from every housetop on President week.

A FEW FACTS . /
Â¦ ' ATxmt the New "Catarrh Cfuxer ~
The new Catarrh Cure Is a new depart-
ure In so-called catarrh cures because it
actually cures, and. Is not simply a tem-
porary relief. . '.':.. ââ¢
The 'new Catarrh Cure is not a calve,
ointment, powder nor liquid,. but a pleas-
ant tasting tablet containing the best spe-
cifics for catarrh in a concentrated, con-
venient form. ...
The old style of catarrh salves and oint-
ments are greasy, dirty and inconvenient
at the best: the -new preparation being In
tablet form is always clean . and con-
venient. â¢ : . /_â¢ :'Â¦ ' â¢ . .. â¢
The new Catarrh Cure is superior to
Catarrh powders because" it is a notorious
fact that many catarrh powders contain
cocaine. * â¢ ' . .
The new Catarrh Cure Is called Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, a wholesome combina-
tion of blood root, beechwood tar, guaiacol
and other antiseptics, and . cures Â¦ by Its
action upon the blood and mucous ' mem-
branes, the " only rational' treatment for
catarrhal trouble. -
You do not have to draw upon . your
imagination to discoyer ".whether ..you are
getting benefit from Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
Tete; improvements . and < relief are appa-
rent from the first tablet taken.: v-
All druggists sell and recommend- them.
They cost but 50 cents for full sizedrpack-
ages, and any catarrh . sufferer who has
Â¦wasted time and money on sprays, salves
and ' powders . will appreciate <, to the â¢ full
the merit of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets. '

thing looks favorable for the success ol
the fair.
At 1 a, m. the situation is one approach
ing desolation In a large section of che
city The burned district reaches from
Burbridge street on the north to the St.
Johns River on the south, a distance of
not aulte two. miles. The width of the
desolated area is thirteen blocks Within
this space practically everything is black
ened ruins. On Bay street, the principal
mart of trade, going west, the Western
Union Telegraph Company's building is
the first building standing. Everything
east of Laura and Bay Is gone.
At 10-15 o'clock the fire was under con
trol having practically burned itself out.
The suburban settlements, with the excep
tion of La Villa, are Intact. La Villa was
badly hurt. The extent of the damage
cannot be told until to-morrow. Thou
sands of persons are on the streets to

worldly possessions upon their backs. The

likely that the exigencies of the occasion
will demand such action. It is hoped that
an appeal can be avoided.

*/| Estimate of the Losses.
â¢A partial estimate of the losses, as se
cured up to 8:30 o'clock last night, is as
follows: I " -
Cleveland Manufacturing Company, $25.
000; Commercial Bank, $50,000; First Na
tional Bank, $15,000; Huhbard's block.
$50,000; Industrial Savings and Trust Com
pany, $5000; Windsor Hotel and annex.
$35,000; St. James Hotel,. $40,000;- Hotel
Placid, $15,000; Mohawk block, $50,000:
Gardnerjjuilding, $200,000; Furchgott build-
Desolation in a Large Section.
The new Furchgott building was soon
ablaze- and then quickly the Gardiner
building was also a mass of flames. Down
the street the fire spread with great ra
pidity and the entire section of Bay street
from Market to Main and extending for
five blocks was burning all at once.
The city buildings went, the Fire De
partment building, the armory, the Coun
ty Courthouse; the Clerk's office, contain
ing the county^ records; the Criminal
Court house, the County Jail and the
graded schools and the Catholic church
and orphanage, St. John's Fpiscopal
Church andthe convent. All this destruc
tion was wrought In less than four hours.
Six lives are reported lost In the confla
gration The Mayor has called a meeting
Sf the City. Council for to-morrow f to con
sider ways and means of relieving the
sufferers.
City Buildings Burned.
Soon Senator Tallafero's residence, then
the adjoining houses on that block, were
ablaze, and in spite of all efforts to save
the Windsor and the St. James hotels
both hostelries were quickly enveloped In
flames. For quite an hour the guests In
the Windsor had been busy packing their
trunks and many of them had gone away
loaded with trunks and grips, some, un
fortunately, to the United States Hotel,
but most of them to Riverside.
Leaping across the street from the
Windsor the flames attacked the Seill3
House and then the Methodist parsonage
and in a few moments the Trinity Meth
odist Church was a mass of flames. The
opera-house block followed and the Rich
ards and Livingstone boarding-houses. A
desperate effort was made to save the
Baldwin mansion, vhich was recently
purchased by the Elks for $18,000. No
earthly power could save this building and
that entire block and the one west was
quickly a mass of flames.
Once the fire got started on Main street
the closely adjoining buildings went, one
after another. Taint shops with barrels
of oil were plentiful In this district and
as they caught fire, one after the other,
the blaze, rising hundreds of feet high,
quickly set the buildings across the street
on fire. When - the Hubbard hardware
store began -to burn the people scattered.
Hundreds of pounds of powder and a
great deal of dynamite were stored in tms
building. In ten minutes there was a roar
and the building collapsed like an egg
shell. The dynamite and powder had ex
ploded. Here again there was much dan
ger for the firemen. ' Cartridges began to
explode and bullets began to fly around
and the effort to fight the flames at this
point had for a tinie to be abandoned
This was only the start of the most In
tense-part of the fire.
Collapses Like an Eggshell.
The casualties cannot be accurately es
timated to-night. That there were sev
eral seems -to be well authenticated.
Among them, was that of the Fire Chief,
who sustained a bad fall. In all six lives
are reported to have been lost.
The Mayor ordered all saloons closed
and has impressed help to clear the
wreckage. The Mayor, at a late hour,
stated that he estimated the loss, at $15,
000,000 and that 10,000 to 15,000 people were
homeless. * ;T
W. W. Cleveland, In whose premises the
fire originated and who was one of the
heaviest losers, dropped dead from excite
ment. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ â¢ - _
A stalwart negro bringing a trunk on
his head from a burning building went
crazy from the horror of the situation.
He ran around a circle with the trunk on
hi3 head until he sank exhausted and
died.
At night the military was ordered out
to guard the household goods piled nlKn
in vacant lots.
Along the entire length of Beaver
street, from Davis to the creek on Liber
ty street, all buildings were destroyed.
For fourteen blocks Ashley and Church
streets have both been completely blotted
out. When the fire reached Bridge street
In its eastward course, it enveloped in
flames an area three blocks wide, taking
In Duval, â¢ Monroe and the ncrth side or
Adams street, burning that entire section
of the city and running fourteen biocks
to the Duval-street bridge. *
The fire covered, as far as Is definitely
known, a distance of two and a half miles
by half a mile wide. When the fire
reached Julia street It was a. roaring con
flagration and there was no prospect of
it being put under control. The local mili
tary companies were called out to keep
back the crowds and the Fire Department
began to use dynamite to blow up houses
a block from the fire, hoping thus to pre
vent it from spreading. So fierce was
the blaze, however, and so strong had
become the wind that millions of sparks
and flying, burning shingles spread over
five or six blocks, setting the roofs of the
houses on fire in advance of the depart
ment. . . , . . : _ .... . , ; ,. ,,-. ,
1 JACKSONVILLE, Fla., May 4, 1 a. m.â
The most disastrous fire in the history of
this city began yesterday shortly after
noon in a small factory, started by a de
fective wire, according to the best belief,
and. burned for nearly ten hours. In that
time a property loss estimated at from
$10,000,000 to $15,000,000 was caused. Ac
cording to the city map, 130 blocks were
burned,' many of them in the heart of the
business and^residence sections. The es
timate of houses to the block is 'ten,
hence 1300 of them, went up in smoke.
Many of the finest public and private
buildings were destroyed, Including ho
tels, theaters, churches and residences.

China is to pay was fixed at 1.365,000,000
francs. The Foreign Office now announces
that the amount should have been l.Coo,
000,000 francs. However, this amount may
be reduced. These figures provide tor ex
penses up to July 1.
The Foreisn Office is anxious that tne
United States support Germany's proposal
lo increase the Chinese customs duties.
and wishes it to be pointed out that it
â¢will be proved to be the best guarantee
of the "open door." As no .satisfactory
alternative is suggested which will pro

"WOULD EEDUCE INDEMNITY.
Russia Willing to Join America and

LONDON, May 4.â Dr. Morrison, wiring
to the Times from Peking Thursday,
says: M. de Giers has addressed a let
ter to the financial committee of the Min
isters of the powers, urging the economi
cal advantages cf giving to China a con
ioint government guarantee to enable her
to raise a loan with which to pay the
indemnities. He argues that in order to
pav Â£G5 000 000 China will only need to Is
sue a loan of Â£75.000.000 at 4 or 4*4 per
cent. Without a guarantee she would be
compelled to borrow Â£54.000,000 at 7 per

issue of only Â£43.000,000.
He suggests .that the loan can be se
cured on the customs or by an increase of
import duties. The latter is instructive
as showing Kussia's unwillingness to in
terfere with the imperial revenue, such
as the Manchu pensions and 'the grain
tribute.
On the other hand It shows Russia's
willingness to throw the burden upon the
foreign import trade, in which she has
practically no interest. The letter fur
ther shows Russia's apparent readiness
to join Great Britain and the United
States in a reduction of the indemnity in
return for a conjoint government guar
antee. ;

LONDON, May 3.â The Indian Secre

question in the House of Commons ..to

British troops from looting at Peking, but
the general had authorized parties â¢ to
bring in unclaimed property from desert

sold for the benefit of all. "This action,

"was proper and judicious."

In which a country club has played for
the trophy emblematic of the cricket

several players who- formerly belonged to
the' Citrus Colony Cricket Club of Placer

SOUTH -ENDS TO HOLD
POSTPONED REGATTA
It is said that notice ' is about to be
served on the Ariel and Pioneer rowing
clubs to quit the quarters they have oc-.
cupied for so. many years on Long wharf.
Though it may not be necessary to move
away at once, the clubs are husbanding
their resources with a view to meeting the
expense attendant upon the change, which
must soon take place. Under these cir
cumstances It is hardly likely that a cor
dial response will be. made' to the sugge's
tion of- the Alameda oarsmen that a row
ing regatta be held by the clubs, each
contributing a quota of- the expense of
conducting the races and providing tro
phies. A letter has been^ent'to T. Sanda,
chairman of the regatta committee of the
Pacific Association of the Amateur Ath
letic Union, asking him to call a meeting
of the committee for the purpose of dis
cussing the prospect of an open regatta.
The. committee ..will ,.be .called together
some evening next week, but it is doubtful
whether: any . satisfactory -result can be
reached. The-rcal .difficulty is theÂ«lack of
a .course where smooth water can be
found for the light racing craft and some
revenue obtained to provide for expenses
and prizes. So unless-some change takes
place. in the. situation the chances for an
open regatta just now are. poor.
The South^Ends had made preparations
to hold a regatta for their own members
last Saturday,- but the -Â¦ southeasterly
storm , rendered r it necessary to postpone
the races* They will be held to-rmorrow
if the weather. Is suitable, i A meeting was
held on Thursday,- night in s the office . of
Dr. C. C. Denis to discuss rowing mat
ters and the question of incorporating the
South End Rowing Club. /The regatta to
morrow-, will begin at .10:30 a.: m.,- and is
intended" to be the first of a series of
monthly club regattas. Â¦Â¦"-Â« There will be
barge, putrigged skiff and shell races,
both scratch and , with handicap. E. Scul

NIONTEALEGRE'S JOB
IS A CENTURY RIDE
The annual . hundred-mile relay race of
the California Associated Cyclists will b*
held a week from to-morrow, the course
being from this city to San Jose, return
ing on the other side of the bay to Ala
meda. There is some doubt as to ho-w
many clubs will enter the contest this
year. It is certain that the Bay City
Wheelmen and the Olympic Club Wheel
men and the Garden City Wheelmen of
San Jose will enter teams, and it i3 prob
able that the Reliance Club of Oakland
and the California Cycling Club, of this
city will also be among the contestants.
The . clubs will hold final try-outs to
morrow to pick the men for their teams,
and the entries will close with F. G. Mon
tealegre, the new chairman of the racing
board, next Wednesday. Incidentally Mr.
Montealegre has a task ahead of him to
morrow which none will envy him. H>?
has cot to ride over the entire course on
his wheel, and it is stated that. In some
places the course will have to be changed
slightly, owing to the road being cut up
where repairs are being made. By goins
over it the entire length Mr. Montealegra
Â¦will have all the facts before him. and
after he has had a good rest Monday may
be able to issue a bulletin stating what
the official course will be.
Dan J. Canary, the famous trick bicycle
rider and juggler, is in the city and will
hereafter make it his home. Mr. Canary
has retired from the stage and is now in
a commercial business, but he still takes
an interest in the wheel for pleasure only,
and no one need be surprised If some day
they see a pleasant faced young man
coasting .down the street on one wheel or
standing on his head on the saddle.
E. O. Kragness, the Olympic Club bicy
cle rider, who was thought some time ago
to be afflicted with heart trouble which
would prevent his participation in athletic
events In the future, is now pronounced
fully recovered by his physician. Mr.
Kragness will shortly resume training in
order to get in shape for the summer
races. He states that ha is in the best
of condition and expects with proper
training to be able to equal any of his
past successes.

Now that the number of golfers at the
Presidio and Point Adams links is con
siderably reduced the San Rafael Golf
Club's course presents a lively appearance
on holidays. To-day representatives of all
the golf clubs around the bay will take
part in the open tournament to be held
on the links in Happy. Valley. This morn
ing there will be a tournament over eight
een holes, medal' play, from scratch, for
ladies. Entries have been received from
the San Francisco, Oakland, Sausalito and
San Rafael Golf clubs.
The representatives of the San > Fran
ciÂ«co Golf Club are Miss Edith â¢McBean,
Miss Hager, Miss Caro Crockett, Miss
Sarah Drum, Miss Cornelia O'Connor,
Miss Maud O'Connor. From the Oakland
Golf Club come Mrs. H. H. Sherwood and
Mrs. W. P. Johnson. The representative
of the Sausalito Golf Club is Miss Mason.
The hortor of the home club will be up
held by Mrs. R. Gllman Brown, Mrs. J. J.
Crooks and others. Play will begin after
the arrival of the first train from San Ra
fael. â¢
In the afternoon, after the arrival of the
12:33 o'clock boat from San Francisco,
there will be a scratch tournament over
eighteen holes for men. Many of the best
known golfers of this part of the State
will take part, among them being the first
champion of all Calitornia, Ernest R. Fol
ger or the Oakland Golf Club; J. A. Fol
ger, P. E. Bowles, vice captain, P. E.
Bowles Jr., and other members of the
same club; B. D. Adamson, S. L. Abbot
Jr., Leonard Chenery, Worthington- Ames,
W. H. La Boyteaux and E. J. McCutchen
of the San Francisco Golf Club; R. Gil
man Brown, J. J. Crooks, R. J. Davis,
Carter P: Pcmeroy, C. P:Eells, Dr. II. O.
Howitt and Maurice Dore of the San Ra
fael Golf Club, and R. W. Mason of the
Sausalito Golf Glub. It is quite likely that
several more entries than those given
above will be received. The ladies' event
should produce an interesting contest be
tween Mrs. R. Gilman- Brown and Mrs.
H. H. Sherwood, while among the men
champion E. R. Folger and B. D. Adam
son will probably run each other very
closely for top place. - .
The Sausalito golfers will soon be in
their clubhouse, which is expected to be
reedy for occupation to-morrow. Though
of simple construction and containing only
two rooms, it, will be a great convenience
to the golfers, who have hitherto had no
place of shelter or rest on the links. As
the Sausalito Golf Club is now for the
lirst time in a position to entertain vis
itors, the return match between teams of
the Ran Rafael and Sausalito clubs will
be played next Saturday on the Fort Ba
ker links. The recent heavy rain has en
couraged the thick grass and thistles to
grow, but the putting greens are in fair
condition, and, as the Sausalito represent
atives will be on their own course, they
hope, to press the San Rafael team more
closely than on the occasion of their first
meeting on the San Rafael links.
The Sausalito Golf Club is on the eve of
its annual meeting and election of offi
cers. The nominating committee, consist
ing of James E. Bell, Charles J. Foster
and Dr. A. H. Mays, has prepared the fol
lowing list of names as the regular ticket
for the council: Major T. W. M. Draper,
Charles J. Foster, Andrew C. Wilson. H.
Clay Miller, C. Terry Hamilton, A. Starr
Keeler and W. G. Morrow. The nominees
for members of the green .committee are
Reginald W. Mason (chairman). Major T.
W. M. Draper, and J. M. Kilgarif. The
following are the nominees for the house
committee, which consists wholly of
ladies: Mrs, T. W. M. Draper, Mrs/ A.
Starr Keeler, Mrs. C. J. Foster, Mrs F,
B. Findley, Miss Grace Martin, Miss Con
stance Borrowe, Miss Miller, Miss Alice
Findley and Miss Mason. The meeting of
the council and the general election will
take place on Saturday, May 23, in the
guild hall of the Episcopal church at Sau
sallto. The officers of the club will be
chos-en by the nine members of the coun
cil from among their own number.

nual Championship Event
SACRAMENTO TOURNEY
NORTHERN, CRACKS
ON THE COURTS
The California Coursing Committee
stake, which is programmed for the 26th
inst., has already begun to assume a
proportion .which bids fair to make it a
great event. Conditions considered, it will
certainly attract as much attention as any
previous meet In America. Confined as It is
to nominations from members only and
with the best dogs now in the game to
pick from, a j good-natured rivalry has
shown itself in the selection of performers
for the stake. The affair will attract lov
ers of the sport from all sections of the
State, and. not without hope of success, as
the home talent is far from having a cer
tainty on the coveted honors.
So far no nominations for the big event
have been recorded, though, some of the
following are probable: J. A. Klein will
name Palo Alto, Dan Delury wants Sis
quoc, P. J. Reilly will enter Warship, Dr.
Clarke of Stockton will let Rector, run for
him, W. H. Carmichael will nominate
Luxor. Dr. Weldon of Sacramento will
have Sacramento Boy try for the Capital
City, R. K. Malcolm has Fine Fire in
training for the last flag, J. H. Rosseter
expects to win out with. Rural Artist, H.
A. Deckelman feels that victory is his
with Rocker or Master Rocket- and Cap
tain Clarkson has hopes that Golden Gart
er can bring home the goods. The Vallejo
contingent will back Jimmy Anthony, and*
the Los Angeles leashmen will want
Crawford Lass to represent them. With,
every member of the committee boosting
the event, it is a certainty that the fol
lowers of the game will be given a treat
in this stake of champions.
The unexpected demise of the celebrated
stud dog Emin Pasha has been announced,
and the Pasha Kennels, in consequence,
are in mourning. The great sire has left
a record which will stand for many a day.
Emin -Pasha's get numbers among them
the speedy Palo Alto, Sisquoc and num
bers of stake winners. .
* In the Ingleslde section bad luck has fol
lowed in the wake of the coursers. Jolly
Rover started the hoodoo by killing the
fine litter by Fortuna Fayente out of
Dawn and was himself destroyed. Last
week Captain Clarkson's Headwater broke
its hind leg by running against a tree
while chasing a cat. The bone was so
badly shattered that relief was impossible
and the captain had the hound put out of
its misery. Headwater was in training for
the California Committee stake. Faithful
Lad, too, was injured among the trees and
a badly wrenched shoulder is the result.
E. M. Kellogg's Crawford GJrl is laid up
because of an accident, and her recovery
Is doubtful. . ...
P. C. Curtis, the senior member of the
firm." of Curtis & Sons has gone East.
Before his departure he sold the great
coursing dog Beacon, Maud S and Bed of
Roses, a puppy, to A. R.. Curtis.

THE BIG STAKE
HORIZON STILL
SHOWS McGOVERN
TERRY AND HIS MATCHES
Comments and Facts on Past
and Prospective Fights.
July Heavyweight Battle
The San Francisco public has seen the
"Terrible" McGovern in fighting action.
Wise fight-promoters knew that the house
would be a good ore, even if McGovern's
opponent should prove no match for him.
for the ring-going public of this city was
on the edge of anxiety to see the "Terror
of Brooklyn" perform with the gloves. .
McGovern has been seen. He has dem
onstrated what he can do. The public is
anxious to see him again, but not in a one
sided battle. If Terry is to fight
a second time, whoever matches him must
find a man who can give an argumentâ
something that will make a contest. The
fingers of all point to Frank Erne and if
the Twentieth Century Club will bring
these two men together it may count on
a house that will be packed to the doors.
As Err.e says: he will not fight under 133
pounds, the match, if consummated, ought
to be worth a trip of many miles to see.
Frank Erne has grown very heavy since
his arrival in San Francisco some few
months ago and he will find it difficult to
reduce to the 133-pcund mark. He knows
this, too. but he will work his fingers off
Jo secure another match with Terry. At
this weight* McGovem concedes tvfi
pounds, goes far out of his. class and takes
big chances. That is the misfortune of
being a small man champion. At his
\7cight there is no fighter who can even
Â¦warm up the "Terrible," so if he is to go
rn fighting- he must move ov.t of his class.
Then the public will see McGovern fight
ing against odds and possibly making
himself more of a wonder than he is at
present.
Â» â¢ *
McGovern-Herrera. The general opinion
in regard to this match is that Sam Har
ris. McGovern' s manager, picked up a
snug side bet when the match was made.
It- is the intention of both parties to the
contract to hold the fight in Fresno or
Pakersfield some time before the. end of
this month. Tim McGrath will train Her
i*era at his road resort near San Jose.
Terry will do light work at his old quar
ters in this city. Herrera, as far as lin
gval courage goes, has shown that he does
not fear the "Terrible" one whit. In fact,
he is of the opinion that McGovern is
an easy man, much overrated and quite
an ordinary fighter. He will attempt to
prove the truth of his beliefs. It will be
a good fight for the country. And yet
Herrera has acquitted himself creditably
In several fights.
About the time San Francisco has be
come sated with feather and light weight
fighters the big. burly men will be intro
duced upon the scene. The San Francisco
Club, which means Ned Homan Alec
Greg-gains, is fast upon the trail -of a let
cf big ones and the chain of telegrams
that have been clicking -westward por
tends some rare fisticuff event for July.
The favored scheme is for an open-air
fight on July i between Fitzsimmons and
Jeffries. Homan, who is now In- NÂ«;w'
York, thinks he can land Fitzsimmons,
Jeffries ar-d Ruhlin. ' While Homan is do
ing the angling Greggains is receiving tel
egrams every other minute and each one
broadens the smile on his face.
Charley White, who is acknowledged a
referee of marked ability, said during one
of the preliminary fights at the Mechan
ics" Pavilion last week: "It is true that
referees exercised their rights in the ring.
When it becomes apparent to a referee
that one man is altogether outclassed and
that his physical condition is such that
there can be no cuestion as to the final
outcome he should stop the fight and not
wait for the knockout punch. I will
admit that it is just possible for a lucky
punch to turn the tide of battle, but that
should not change the complexion of
'things. The sport would be srreatly im
proved if wise discretion of this sort were
exercised oftener.
The baseball season has passed its first
period and is now running on a steady
course. The four teams in the league are
fairly -well balanced; they have been play
ing good baseball and give evidence of
being interested in the work before them.
But one thing that must be observed i3
gentlemanly conduct on the field. T^ere
has been too much kicking against the
umpire and his decisions. In some cases
these decisions were undoubtedly faulty,
but since the umpire's word is final ft can
be of no service to object or profane the
air. The California League should read
a lesson to one of its umpires. Donohue
might be better equipped to judge as to
balls and strikes if he would use eve
water.
To-day and to-morrow will be opers
dates on the sailing programmes of thÂ»-
San Francisco and the Corinthian Yacht
clubs, but In Oakland Creek several of
the skippers will be spending this after
noon in preparing their craft for a chal
lenge race to be held to-morrow over th^
"Wallace trophy course. The yachts that
will probably take part In the race art-
Commodore S. S. Marshall's sloop Thelma.
J. T. Carrier's sloop Jessie E, Kendall an.;
Greene's sloop Alert, & and L."I. Gales
sloop Secret, F. R. Millar's sloop Lai
wlng 1 and ex-Commodore Allen M. Clay's
sloop Pactolus. The largest of these b
the new sloop Alert, the over, all length
of which is 45 feet. She will..consequent
ly, have to give time to all the smalle
craft. The course will be from the south
erly pier head of the narrow gauge mole
at Alameda, out to and around- Presidio
Shoal buoy and back to the point of start
ing. Commodore S. S.. Marshall., has been
absent from business for a day or twi
on account of sickness, and so the flag
ship may not be seen in the race. *
! The crew of the -winning yacht will en-
Joy a dinner at the expense of the crews
of the beaten craft. The race will.be un
der the management cf th,e regatta com
mittee, which consists of A. R. F-
Brandes, Eugene Flanders and N. L.
Meads. The Qualities of the-' sloop Alert
are largely unknown, as she Is a new
boat and has probably not yet effected
the best adjustment of Jier canvas anil
ballast The winner of to-day's event will
be likely ta sail a. good race for the Wal
lace trophy, which is competed for an
nually on Decoration day. The present
holder is E. F. Sagar's sloop Edna, which
is enrolled in the Corinthian and Cali
fornia fleets. J. T. Carrier's Jessie E, if
her owner has got her into her best trim,
should go very near capturing one or both
of these events.
Last Sunday was a rough and stormy
day on the bay, so much so, indeed, that
the opening cruise of the San Francisco
Tacht Club was postponed. The sloop
Pactolus. which conveyed Allen M. Clay
and crew over to Sausallto on the pre
vious day to witness the opening: jinka,
weighed anchor about 12:45 p. m., under
reduced sail, and reached her moorings
in Oakland Creek safely. The- Corinthian
yachts which were present at the open-
Ir.g also cruised back to their moorings
at Tlburon. Jules Hartman's sloop Mas
cotte of the California Yacht Club was
out with a party of young men,, who had
all the yachting- they wanted before they
got back on Monday to dry land, food
and warmth. The sloops Venito and Trio,
which had large parties on board, also
had hard trips, though both ultimately
landed all their freight In safety.
The first cruise of the San Francisco
Yacht Club to Vallejo is set down for next
Saturday, on which day the Corinthians
will also make Vallejo their rendezvous.
The California yachtsmen have a ladles'
cruise to Lone Tree Cove. Angel i Island,
set down for next Saturday, but it is like
ly that they will defer it, and cruise to
Vallejo instead. It was expected that the
new boathouse of the Vallejo Yachting
and Boating Club would have been suffi
ciently advanced to receive the visiting
yachtsmen, who were to have been enter
tained with an opening jinks. But It ap
pears now that the clubhouse is not yet
ready for occupation, so that this part
ot-. the visit -must be. abandoned. Â¦ "W. J
TV'ood.-owner ot the yaoht Angela, has
resigned, the office 'of commodore' of the
Vallejo Yachting Club, as he expects to
leave for Alaska on an extended- vacation.
On Sunday. May 12, the San Francisco
yachts will race down from Vallejo ta
Sausalito in. cruising rig.
The raffle for the sloop Catherine, which
represented the San Francisco Yacht Club
in one of the races for the Perpetual Chal

dosing: event on the card at
I Oakland track yesterday furnished
II one of the prettiest and most ex
il citing finishes of the entire racing
season. Strung across the track as
the wire was reached, a neck, a head and
a nose apart, Goldone, Horton. Donator
and Handlcapper, the only starters, fin
ished In the order named. The distance
was seven furlongs, and the smart ones
had selected Handicapper with Jack Mar
tin up to win. No doubt Horton would
have been favorite but for the fact of
Glerji, a boy seen but little in the caddie,
having the mount. The ultimate winner,
Goldone, touched threes and was then
backed down to 13 to 6, second . choice.
Handlcapper made all the running, closely
attended by Goldone and Donator. A fur
long from home, under hard urging, Hor
ton caught up with tfie front trio, and a
desperate drive ensued. From there on
Goldone displayed the best staying qual
ities and Bassinger outfinished Glenn.
Two choices only â¢were successful.
Gauntlet and Good Hope. The track was
flow and inclined to be cuppy and this
accounts for . the time which marked the
running of the different events.
An unhappy start for the favorite, Estro,
In the opening: number a.t seven furlongs,
resulted in Rainier getting the purse. Bas
singer rode the latter horse, which was
second choice, and, shooting to the front,
lasted long enough to beat. the favorite
half a length. Sylvan Lass, a 50 to 1 shot,
ran third. . .
This was followed by the win of i the
two-year-old dash at four and a half fur
longs by Phil Crimmins, an 8 to 1 shot.
Achilles, the first choice, had no speed,
and. after being in front from the start,
Conley put Crimmlns over the plate first,
two lengths ahead of Estado, the second
choice.
Eonic. the 7 to 10 favorite for the three
year-old selection at six and a half fur
longs, ran a very disappointing race, fall-
Ing to show any speed. The mare looked
stale and tucked up and probably wants
a rest. Andrattus, at odds of 5 to L went
out in the lead and, never headed, dis-*
pesed of Moonbright without effort. The
choice lost show honors to Dunfree;
Billy Randall's Gauntlet scored a clever
victor}' In the mile and a quarter selling
event. An S to 5 favorite, he was ridden
to perfection by Ransch. beating out Ma
lay a length Jn 2:10. Gotobed did not find
the track to his liking, losing third place
to Twinkler.
Pounds the best on this particular occa
sion. Good Hope, the favorite, defeated
quite a collection of speed in the slx-fur
long run. fifth to be decided. Ransch suc
ceeded in getting away from the post
poorly, but the mare gamely went through
the bunch, until at the wire she won
handily from .Vantine and Hi*h Hoe. The
latter mare was very badly ridden by Al
exander.
Track Notes.
"Tim" Maloney, an exercise boy in the
employ of Harry Whitman, was killed at
Oakland track yesterday morning while
galloping Fine Shot. The accident occur
red at the head of the stretch on the in
side track and was due to a collision with
Wh&ngdoodle, a 1 horse owned by Tom
Ryan, ridden by a boy named "Jimmy"'
Bender. The latter, from all accounts,
was galloping his horse the reverse way
of the track and, contrary to custom, kept
in next the rail instead of taking the out
side. Maloney -was unseated, and as one
foot failed to slip from the stirrup the
unfortunate rider was dragged nearly an
eighth of a mile before the horse fell.
His skull was crushed and his body badly
mangled, death resulting in a very short
time. Maloney was born in Sacramento
and was about 16 years of age. He was
employed by Harry Whitman and was to
have had the mount on Whaleback in the
opening race yesterday. He gave promise
of becoming a good rider.
Matt Early, a colored trainer, who came
to California two years a^o with Marley
Kittleman's horses and later went to Ho

of heart disease. He was in the employ
of Prince David and left several hundred
dollars, besides some jewelry.

looked like the safest kind of a hit when
It started. , - - :
The other feature of the day was the
wordy war Hanlon and Donohue fell into,
and Hanlon fell out of the game. It was
all over the matter of an ill-judged strike.
Hanlon protested the game on the ground
that- the referee had. -no right to eject

between McGovern and Erne himself. Arf
hour of talk was wasted , and no match
will be made/for the "present at least. Â¦Â¦â
Harris would not consent to \ a match
with McGovern at the weight, at which
Erne wished to fight. Th*e latter said
that out of protection to himself and his
friends he would not enter, the ring at less
than 132 pounds. Harris asked for 128 at
the ringside, the same weight agreed upon
when Erne and McGovern. met in New
York last July.' Ernasaid that this would
mean that he should enter the ring a dead
man and refused the conditions point
blank. Erne has Â» taken on a -great deal
of weight here, but was willing to make
132 at the ringside.
Many other conditions were -suggested
by the fight promoters, -but no agreement
could, be reached. Harris promised Erne
that if Terry, took 'on- weight he would
give him a chance at his own demand.",-.

MUSIC : AND FLIGHT.
DR. ANDREW \VILSON, F.| R. S. E., in a
contribution to the Edinburgh Scotsman re
viewing the progress of science and invention,
states that at a recent 'meeting of electrical experts in
London one of them, Mr. Duddell, gave an account
of certain experiments he had' made showing that
electric arcs can.be so manipulated as to evoke musi
cal tones. It is claimed by the. experimenter that by
the aid of suitable [apparatus electric , lights could be
played" upon like an organ and' made to give/forth
music possessing both delicacy, and strength. '
Commenting upon the experiments jH Dr.V Wilson
says : ' "The â¢ subject is more of a' scientific curiosity
at present 'than' anything else, but itvjs- never; safe 'â¢ to
"predict what may be the development of any new dis
covery in the domain of electrical 'energy." He sug
gests that it is j. quite probable the phrase "electrical
organ" may soon be applied to'an instrument which
w: 11 much more nearly. correspond, with thatfdescrip
tion than does-one in which drily the keys are oper
ated by electrical force.; . : r , ' J- -,Â¦->'.
The - possibilities of the invention are. enticing to
the imagination. When the electric dynamos; that" are
used to/generate; light by 'night can be v - used also to

trate of the nation, and there is hardly anything in
which it could^be of more value to us to have 'him
The Government works. at Mare Island are the
most important on the Pacific Coast, and. yet .they. We
by no means all that is desirable. In the course of a
personal^ inspection of them the President and his
Cabinet w<yild readily perceive in what respect ex
tensions and improvements are necessary to fit the
station for the increasing work imposed upon it by the
recent development of our national interests in all
lands around the Pacific Ocean, and the administra
tion would therefore be more inclined than ever 'to
support our Senators and Representatives in their
efforts to from Congress the -appropriations
needed for making the yard adequate to the demand
upon it.
It is well. known that one of the obstacles in the
way of advancing California interests at Washington
is the comparative ignorance of Eastern statesmen
concerning the full extent of the importance of thosa
interests to the nation. The thing that is near at hand
always appear larger than the thing that is remote.
Consequently the various forts, navy-yards and other
governmental plants in the East fill a larger place. in
the minds of Eastern statesmen than do those on this
side of the. continent. -We should, therefore, take ad
vantage of every opportunity to bring visiting states
men into personal contact with the Government sta
tions in .California. An inspection of any establish
ment of the kind would have more effect in bringing
about a clear appreciation of its relative value to the
Â«iation than could volumes of reports and descriptions,'
or any .number of speeches in the House or the
Senate. -'Â¦ ,
It can hardly be doubted that the President would
most gladly avail himself of an' opportunity to visit
Mare Island if it be afforded him. Ever since he left
the army his mind has been occupied with govern
mental affairs. Every form of the work carried on bv
the nation is. of interest to him, and now that he is
President and has great duties to, fulfill in regard to
all governmental activities his interest is keener than
ever. A personal inspection of so important a Gov
ernment station as that at Vallejo would, therefore,
be to him a matter of no little gratification, since it
would enable him to understand more clearly what has
been accomplished there and what more is required- to
make future accomplishment greater still.
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that a trip to
Vallejo, while it would not take much time, would be
for the President and his party a welcome rest from
the parades and functions of his reception in the city.
For that reason, therefore, as. well. as for the others
stated, the petition, from Vallejo should be granted.
Let the committee in charge of the reception see to
it that the President and his Cabinet visit Mare Isl
ands Vallejo petitions it, and the interests of the Pa
cific Coastâ and indeed of the whole nationâde
mand it." ~ .

XHâ MINT SERVICE ' O F THE ITNITED STATES. .
The United State's has^now three' mints i
in operation," located at Philadelphia, New j
Orleansaiid'San Francisco.- In addition'to ]
these if maintainsY assay offices at New ,
York, St. Louis. -,Deadwood,7 Deliver, â¢
Helena/ Boise, Carson, Seattle and Char- i
lotte';- , N;; C;;;' The; Institutions at Carson j
andj Charlotte were j formerly mints, but .
owing," tola- decline-in 'the importance of
the': mining fields â¢ tributary to them they
were J reduced^ to V assay- offices. . On , the
other haridi" the Denver^ofnce wiU'soon be-' 'Â¦
come a'vmint,;:Corigress,' having appro
priated $500,000>f6r'a*bulldlng. and. $150,000
for its equipment for coinage operations.
') An: assay office is. practically an outside
agency a -'mint: It receives' bullion, as
certains'and pays : the' coinage value, less^
any charges that may be laid for the ser-'
vice, and ships it to. one of the mints. The
equipment "and Â¦organization" of a mint is
expensive, and it is cheaper to coricentrate
cpinage^operations in . a. fe,w inst|tutioris- -
than} to -â¢ multiply- riiints. '. An assay office
renders " practically the same service . to
the' mining, industry \ that" Is rendered by a
mint/-' The New* York assay office receives
bullion uponVprecIsely^ the same terms as
a, mint, i but. Uhe. others make a special
charge of one-eightli.of 1 per cent in ad
dition to" mint" charges.
. Regulations Regarding Coinage.
.: Bullion that is of standard fineness and
requires no treatment to fit it for. coinage
is | received and coined without charge. If
it ; contains . base or other metal â¢ which
must be removed a refinery charge . is
made, and if it is above the standard an
alloy charge fs made. The law provides
that these charges shall equal but not ex
ceed the cost of the service. From 1792 to
1S53 coinage was free at our 'mints; from
1853 to 1873 the charge was one-half of 1
per cent; the act of 1S73 reduced the coin
age charge on gold to one-fifth of 1 per
cent and excluded silver from. coinage on
private account ; in . 1875, as a measure to
promote 'the resumption of specie pay
ments, the. coinage of gold was made free.
Exchange of Gold for Bullion.
When an owner of gold bullion presents
It at a, mint or assay office it is weighed
in hisp'resence and a receipt given.-
This receipt Moes not state the value of
the deposit; that must be ascertained by
assay,, and the depositor is told to return
at a given time, the next day or within a
â¢ few days, and receive payment. 'The the
ory., of free, coinage Â¦ originally was that
the Government would receive a deposit
or's bullion and return the identical bul
lion in the form of coin, as the old-time
grist mills used .: to recelvtea farmer's
wheat and return the flour made from his
own grain. : But. it is simpler and more
convenient and a saving of time to the
depositor for the Government to advance
the coinage value as soon as the bullion
has ioeen>assayed. The law authorizes the
Secretary of. tho Treasury to keep a sup
ply of coin in each mint for this purpose,
"when the state of the treasury will ad
mit." . . ' â¢â¢Â¦':-â¢
Bullion is received at . a mint by the
weigh clerk, who represents the superin
tendent of the institution, and the weigh
ing is witnessed. by the registrar .of depos
its, who represents the administrative of
fice iat< Washington. From the weigh
clerk's vault the bullion goes to the de
posit melting 1 : room,, where it is. melted as
a precaution against a filled, bar. From
the new bar two clips are taken at oppo
site ends and sent to the assayer. If they
agree in results the bar is paid for on that
basis.. - > - .
, Preparing the Metal for Coinage,
v This bar now passes from the custody
of -the superintendent of the mint to that
of the melter and refiner. He receipts for
it, and gives a heavy. bond. to the Govern
ment, Â¦Â¦'although, in this, as in all such
positions, the bond is insignificant com
pared-with the trust confided to the of
ficer. The melter and refiner of the Phila
delphia mint has $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 in
his custody. Under his direction the metal
is given-: the treatment- required -to fit it
for coinage and is manufactured into in
gots of suitable size for :the. rolling ma'
chines. This done, it is delivered by him
back to the superintendent, and simulta
r.eously.'turned over to. the coiner and re
ceipted for accordingly. ' 'Â»â¢<
The coiner now has the metal in the
shape of ingots of the fineness of coin
and manufactures it into coin: It first
passes through several sets of rolls', then
under a punch which punches out the in
dividual pieces. Each of the latter is
weighed separately, to see that it is with
in the limit of tolerance; then it
through- the milling machine, which gives
it the raised edge; then it is.put in a re
tort or furnace and heated to a- cherry
red. When taken out the pieces are dip
ped in a. mild solution of sulphuric acid
to clean and soften them before going to
the press for. coinage,
Keeping Track of the Precious Metal.
Then' the pieces go to the coining press.
The coiner delivers the money to the su
perintendent ' and takes his receipt. \ The
latter turns it into | the treasury or : pays
it out 'for> more -bullion. ..At least once
every year there is a complete . shutdown
and settlement, and each of these, three
departments of the mint must show ; the
metal charged- to it. The heads of the
departments have a daily settlement, with
Â¦their subordinates, who must account be
fore they leave the building for. the metal
that-has been left in their hands during
the.day. ' ; 'i-' r . '."' * ' " ' '.,
Out of .each- delivery/from coiner to su-.
perintendent 'the latter is required "to, take
indiscriminately- in the presence of the as
sayer a, certain number of pieces,-. which
are sealed and put in a box that Is double
locked and can only be opened' by the ac
tion of both. . Once 'every year the Presi
dent appoints a. body of men known, as
the annual Assay Commission, composed
of prominent, citizens, .: to examine .and
test these reserved coins and; report upon
them.- This is a check: upon the -work of
the . year ' and an ' assurance . to the Presi
dent and through him tp/ the country that
the-. coin is- being: kept at standard. ,'> At
the. same time the reservation ' \ for. the
Assay; Commission is- made >'. other "coins
are withdrawn and â¢ sent to the \ Director
of the mint at Washington and assayed at
once. i . , - â¢ ,
/Taking Care of : the Fractions.
â¢ When'a depositoris paid for" his bullion
he signs a -voucher which Â¦'"Is', forwarded
to, the office of the Director of. rthe Mint
at' Washington; with the original receipt
and all the particulars of the transaction.
Every v calculation is Â¦; verified â¢ there,' arid
! tha-accounts* are passed . over, quarterly
to the auditor for the treasury, in whose
office every transaction and calculation is
a second time reviewed.
" In computing the fineness of bullion de
posits * the Â¦ figures = are carried out Â¦ to ' the
Â¦ quarter .thousandth,-. ; and the fractions

Â¦ The fractions that l thus Inure, . although

silver coins of the United States is 90U
parts in 1000. , The alloy is of copper and
is used to harden the coin v and save it
from abrasion. â¢ >â¢ -
' Gold and Silver Coin Now Minted.
The gold coins now provided for by law
are the double eagle or $20 piece, eagle
or $10 piece, half-eagle or $5 piece and the
quarter eagle or $2 50 piece. The Jl piece
has, been discontinued as too small for
commercial use. Most; of our gold coin
age has been in double eagles, the total
output of gold from the foundation of the
mint -down to June 30, 1900, having been
$2,147,088,113. of. which $1,538,826,060 was In
double eagles.
The silver coins now minted axe the dol
lar, the half-dollar, quarter-dollar and
dime." All silver coinage at present 13
from bullion purchased under the act or
July 14, 1890, commonly known as the
Sherman . act." There is about 61,000,000
ounces of this bullion still on hand. It
was all purchased, for coinage Into silver
dollars, but under the act of March 12,
1900, the Secretary of the Treasury was
authorized to use it for subsidiary coins
a3 might be required,- provided that the
total stock of the latter in the country
should not exceed $100,000,000. The present
stock Is about $87,000,000.
The gold coins and the silver dollar are
a legal tender for all debts. The other
silver coins,' known as subsidiary coins,
are a legal tender to the amount of $10.
.The latter may be had in sums of $200 or
more at any subtreasury or will be sent
by express at the Government's expense
upon the payment of an equal sum of law
ful, money. They are also redeemable in
lawful money at any substreasury in sums
of ?2o or over.
Subsidiary and Minor Coins.
The subsidiary coins are lighter in pro
portion to their face value than the silver
dollar. The latter weighs 412% grains, but
two half-dollars or four quarter-dollars
weigh only 3S5.8 grains. â¢ Â¦ a
The 1-cent and 5-cent pieces are caned
minor coins. The-1-cent piece consists of
95 per cent copper and 5 per cent tin and
zinc. The 5-cent piece is 75 per cent cop
per and 25 per cent nickel. The minor
coins are a legal tender to the amount of
25 cents and are redeemable at any sub
treasury in sums of $20. They are deliv
ered in sums of $20, free of express
charges, on receipt of an equal sum In
lawful money. )
: Profits of th.e Government Mints.
The issue of subsidiary and minor coins
on Government account is a source of
large profit, amounting. on minor coins for
the year ended June 30, 1900, to $1,794,633 04,
or more than the total expenditures- of the
mint service. The profit on subsidiary
coinage last year was $3,008,428 68. The to
tal earnings of the ! mint service for the
last fiscal year. was $10,641,940 60; tho to
tal' expenditures, $1,703,492 64, and the net
earnings of the service, $8,938,447 96.
Against this, however, must be counted
the liability of the Government for all of
this overvalued coin, which it has paid
out to the public at its face value and ia
,in honor, bound ; to maintain at par with
its standard money.
The first mint of the United States was
-established at Philadelphia, the then seat
of government, in 1792. The cornerstone
of the edifice now occupied in Philadelphia
was laid in 1829. A new structure is now
approaching completion in that city, for
for which $2,000 000 has been appropriated,
arid with its equipment it will constitute
the finest mint in the world. It will be oc
cupied about July 1 next. This institu
tion gives employment to about 500 peo
ple. The mint at New Orleans was estab
lished in 1835 and now employs about 200
people. ; : ; Â¦ . â¢
The mint at I San Francisco was estab
lished in 1S52 and now employs about 225
people. The total number of people em
ployed in the mint service is about 1150.
.-. Enormous Volume of Coinage.
'The. coinage of gold during the last fis
cal year was $107,937,110. The coinage of
silver dollars was $18,244,9S4; of subsidiary
silver $12,876.84915, and of minor coln3
$2,243,017 21. The manufacture of the minor
coins involved the striking of 101,301,753
pieces and of subsidiary coins 57,114,270
pieces. It . may be safely said that the
above figures surpass any record before
made by any Government. The total num
ber of pieces struck. last'year by the Royal
Mint in London and all its colonial
branches was 144,823,124, and this was un
precedented . in '; the history of English
coinage" operations. The total number of
Eieces struck. by. the mints of the United
tates last year was 184,373,793.

THE WALL -STREET BOOM.
FOR a longtime past conservative men have. been
watering the course of -Wall street with wonder
riot unmixed with fear.'. The rapid. rise in prices,
the vast sales 'of almost all kinds^ of stocks, and -the
ease with which enormous enterprises are capitalized
and floated/ have excitedadmiration; 'but at the same
time many, of; the wise -old heads of the street haye
gone about saying, "It is splendid, but isit -busi
ness?"'V-\--r, ; ' .'Â¦ :';.Â¦.â¢Â¦Â¦â¢-Â¦ . ''Â£&'Â£?&&
The cautious ones, of course, have hot gone long
\ykhout an answer. To* every doubting. question of .
the conservatives, there, has. been returned ;a prompt
reply from some sanguine ". spirit who st.es in' the en- ,
thusiashi of the street nothing more 1 tha.nl the natural
buoyancy of a people whose industry 'and; commerce!
are not only nourishing but are growing .upon a" soil;,
rich enough to keep them! expanding arid; developing,
for an indefinite period â¢ to . come. ' . Thus%: Senator
Hanna/wheri asked concerning' a predictioh^ofJRuo
sellSage that Wall street has a Black >Friday1 ahead,
answered cheerfully: â¢ "There is riot af cloud^ in" the j
skj r . "I cannot prophesy anything dangerous or threat
ening.' ;We have turned over, a pew leaf. /We .cannot,
measure the presently the past." " '/ . t. Â¦â¢ .r'f
k. The controversy turns upon the nature of. the forces
and conditions that constitute , what, .is , called., a
"boom." The New^ York Tirnes.in defining. the: worii
and explaining its origin says: '"The fact that.it desig
nates the spar. by which the; sail is.stretchedtcr catch
the propelling breezes may explain its suggestivenesa
as a slang term Â¦ useful : in describing the means by
which is brought about a condition of business which
is frequently described as a good deal of
sail.' The length and strength of the. boorn,jof a. sail
ing craft is a factor of pririie importance in determin
ing the amount of sail she/will carry. This fact gave
to the Word boom a significance easily and generally,
appreciated, and probably explains its crystallization,
into our language to describe conditions which are
so far abnormal that no standard English word ex
actly met the requirements of colloquial and news
paper use.": 'â¢ . ...:'Â¦ ' . :
Holding fhe belief that the present boom in Wall
street is in the nature; of ft*"sail set for all winds that
blowj'the TimesTeminds its readers that booms "jibe"
frequently and that those who are not on the-look
out, when the shifting of position takes place "afe
very liable to be reminded of the value of "watchfulness
by being knocked into the cockpit, or overboard, as
the case may be." . - , -
There is, however, another view taken of the con
ditions that constitute a bi>om. r According" to that view
the word does not .mean" a sail of any kind,"nor*was it
brought into the language of 'trade from "any such
source as the Times' says.' It is claimed the, word has
long been in use in the^Mississippi Valley to signify
a rise in the 'waters of the. river. When - the stream
overruns its banks it is said. to be "booming." Thu|,
the argument is that the activity in Wall street is not
due to the spreading of sails for wind, but to the
abounding' and overflowing prosperity of the country.
-It will be .seen there are; several kinds of booms.
Unfortunately there -appears v no safe way of, distin
guishing one from the other until all is over and apost
mort'em is. held. ' The present boom may be a genuine,
substantial, business' affair, but it may also be a specu
lative craze started by clever, men who wish to ob
tain more'than their fair share of the general good.
There is nothing to be gained by being a pessimist
unless one happens to be > a bear like Russell Sage,
but all the same it willbe just as well for .the, average
man to let speculation alone, for- this may be of
the booms that jibe suddenly and there is. no 'telling
when a good many" sanguine fellows are going,tobc
knocked into the cdckpit. : . > â¢ . '
BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT.;
ONE of our contemporaries is quite shaken and
\ shocked because the ' Government . of the
United States has not built the Â¦ Nicaragua
canal long ago, when it is in evidence that, 1 if he chose,'
Pierpont Morgan could -build it in a year and have it
open to commerce..
There is no doubt that Mr. Morgan could -do the
work quicker and better than all the Governments on
earth combined. Undertaken as a private 'enterprise
there' would be no diplomatic or international com
plications.. The states over whose. territory the ditch
passes would enfranchise Mr. Morgan to do the work
and prpbably exact from him an annual subsidy, con
sisting' of a fixed "percentage of the earnings of the
canal, and he would syndicate the enterprise, capitalize
and put it through, and then open' it on equal condi
tions to all nations. Being practically an. extension of
the two oceans, it would be subject to the same prin
ciples of, public and international law as their waters,
and would of necessity, therefore, be ; , neutral water,
f^r its shores would be always within the neutral line.
Â« But Mr/ Morgan has concluded not to build an
isthmian canal at present, therefore the slow motions
of Government must be patiently waited. If one ask
why?are they" slow, all history answers because they
are government motions. It may be set down among
the facts that time and history prove that no.Govern-
Tnerit can do .anything as well as the 'individual can
do it To begin'with, a man can govern himself much
easier, cheaper and better than any Government can
govern him, if he choose. In its very beginning, then,
' government ris~'the outgrowth of the imperfections of
â¢man, and it tias^aU the, characteristics of its* origin.
Justified by the refusal of man to use . his own ca-,
parity, it.. reflects., the incapacity which creates 'and
makes it necessary. ' Â¦/" â¢. Â¦'
/As the isthmian canal is to be constructed -by the
Government, treaties must be .made, international
agreements must be '* ratified, politics, patriotism,
demagogy and corruption must all have a hand in the
pie. The enemies of the" canal, who could not impede
Pierpont Morgan a single day in the work, can im
pede the Government from session to session of Con
gress, perhaps until reaction from, speculation has
brought on a panic and a pinch that will make the
construction impracticable, or untir some. change in
the king row on the international checkerboard has
made it impossible. .. :-
What is happening or failing to happen in the.build
ing of the canal by the Government is an illustration
of the infirmity of Government as a person in busi
ness. Government is for the purpose of making in
dividuals in business do right, keep their .contracts,
.refrain from oppression and abstain from restraint of
trade. It is to make those who supply the people
with water furnish good water at a reasonable price,
and those who furnish transportation to supply it at
a reasonable rate and on terms of equality to all
comers. 'Government can fix the time at which a
railroad shall be finished, by voiding right of way and
other contracts in which time is made the essence.
Government can make all individuals ! keep their
contracts, but >no one can make; Government keep its
contract. It makes -arid : breaks bargains without
apology or liability, and because it is a Government
is incapable of business honor or responsibility.
Fancy a business man- against whom contracts can
not be enforced, who cannot be sued in the courts,
who breaks his, wprd at^will, who is, without business

Spec'.al Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright, 1901, by the Herald Pub
lishing Company.
BERLIN, May 3.â The great smash-up
in the Prussian Ministry has come, and
to-day is a critical day of the first order.
Simultaneously with the ,p losing, of the â¢
session of the Prussian Diet three Min
isters friendly to the Agrarians â Dr. von
Miquel, Minister of Finance; Baron von
Hammersteln-Lexten, Minister of- Agri
culture, and Herr Brefeld, Minister of
Commerce â handed in their resignations.
This means that the Kaiser and Count
von Bulow have declared war on the
Agrarian party. According to the Vos
sische Zeitung, this is directly due to the
initiative of the Kaiser. That journal as
serts that the Prussian Ministry in Its se
cret meeting yesterday received a com
mand from the Kaiser to accept the con
sequences of the new situation his Maj
esty had crea/ed.
Dr. von Miauel, in / leaving the .offlce,
has fired a poisoned arrow at the Impe
rial Chancellor. His friends are spread
ing a report that at the last Council of
Ministers the Minister of Finance advo
cated the dissolution of the Prussian Diet.
Count von Bulow, however, combated
this suggestion in view of the present sit
uation of foreign politics, as Germany,
"en account, of unfortunate China busi
ness, runs a danger_of becoming isolated."
This alleged utterance of the Imperial
Chancellor, which is obviously an inven
tion, is being spread about in order to in
jure Count von Bulow with the Emperor.
The successors of the retiring Ministers
are not yet known. The names of Baron
von Rheinbaben, Prussian Minister of the
Interior, and Count Posadowsky-Wehner,
Imperial Secretary of State for the Inte
rtor, are put forward as successors to Dr.
von Miquel. General von Podbielskl Is
spoken of as the new Minister of Agri
culture. For the Ministry of the Interior,
two names are mentionedâ Herr Better,
Governor of Posen, or Herr von Manteuf
fel, leader of the, Conservative party.
A rousing cheer was given on theBerlin
Bourse when the news of Dr. von Miquel's
resignation arrived. The Berlin press de
votes "long articles to Dr. von Miquel.
Even his adversaries admit the impor
tance of his reform of taxation in Prus
sia.
The Lokal Anzelger says: "Dr. von Mi
quel was one of the greatest Ministers
that the kingdom of Prussia ever had.
He was always a protectionist."
The Berliner Tageblatt says: "The re
tiring Minister is a man of talent, but he
did not possess strength of character."
The Prussian Diet met jointly at 6:30
p. m., and the Chancellor read a royal
message declaring the Diet closed. Count
von Bulow then said:
"As the Government is convinced, in
view of the- course taken In committee,
that an agreement on the canal bill is at
present out of the question it does -not
wish to offer any aid in a continuance of
fruitless discussions."
Then, with three cheers for the Empe
ror, the sitting was ended. All the Min
isters, Â¦ including Dr. von Miquel, were
present. . "

Major General Mac Arthur has strongly
recommended that Colonels Blrkheimer
and Murra^ be promoted to the prade of
brigadier general of volunteers. Officers
who have seen active service in Cuba and
the Philippines say it would be only just
on the part of the President to recognize
the service performed by Quartermaster
General Ludington in appointing him a
major general of volunteers, and Colonel
Thomas Ward, assistant adjutant gen
eral, brigadier general of volunteers. Both
of these officers were indefatigable dur
ing the war with Spain and the rebellion
in the Philippines,* one in equipping and
transporting troops and the other In con
nection with the raising of the regular
and volunteer armies.
WASHINGTON, May 3. â Secretary
Root will recommend to the President
that he formally recognize the excellent
work done by officers of the army by ap

Traders Frantic During Re
. markable Fluctuations
in Prices.
PANIC RULES
CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, May 3.â A panic, the first
real one since Philllos cornered the mar
ket, occurred among shorts in May corn
on the Board of Trade to-day. PricÂ«
fluctuations were the most violent in
years.
Having seen their losses grow heavier
and heavier with eaoli succeeding day for
some time traders who had guaranteed
to deliver May corn to Phillips mado
frantic efforts to get it The price went
from E5c to 58c. 4Vfce higher than yester
day's close. In a few minutes after the
tession began. Shorts surrounded the bull
leader and almost begged for corn. He
was repeatedly called from the pit by
men who wanted to settle privately, but
he told them they had disregarded his
offer to sell to them at 48c and now they
would have to bid In the open market to
him. When reminded that he himself and
the "open market" were synonymous
Phillips smiled.
Fcr an hour shorts bid 5Sc or close to
It. Then Phillips let out 600,000 bushels
at prices ranging between E>7c and 5Sc.
He said it was only a drop in the bucket
compared with the quantity still held by
him. but It netted him a profit of about
$100,000. or approximately 17c per bushel.
This action created intense excitement.
It was thought for a moment that the buil
chief was about to unload and the market
broke to 53c without a check. The drop
disposed of a number of scalping longs
who had 'been clinging to Phillips' specu
lative coattails. Under 5Sc, however.
Phillips sold nothing. In consequence
prices reacted sharply to 5<%c, when trad
ers realized that the end of the corner
was by no means at hand.
In the New York Market.
NEW YORK. Mav 3.â The effect of
drawing in credits on an over-extended
speculation was shown by a slump in the
stock market this afternoon. In the effort
to liquidate prices broke violently
throughout the list Tvith the largest effect
naturally in those atocks in which the
mad rSush to buy has been centered for
the last few days. As the last candidate
for this kind of favor Atchison led the
van. . ,
During this morning there was a hal
cyon prospect of indefinite prices in this
stock. The way in which Atchison and
other stocks mounted skyward relieved
the apprehension remaining from the
rather reactionary tendency of yester
dav's- market and confidence came back
to the speculators that the flurry was over
and it was time to renew the tactics of
buv buv. buy. In consequence such new
prices were made this morning as 90% for
Atchison, 182% for St. Paul 114%. for Bal
timore and Ohio. 115 for Missouri Pacific,
the same for Northern Pacific. 163% for
Rock Island and so on for other active
and prominent stocks.
Then began calling of loans and those
who had been using every dollar of credit
thev could command to buy stocks on
margin began to grow exceedingly un
eaey As prices melted away their nerv
ousness grew to alarm and they began
to "order stocks sold in a hurry. The new
demand had relaxed, as the reaction be
gan to give promise that buyers might get
much lower prices. The professional bears
lent potential aid to the downward move-
Exchange Greatly Excited.
On the floor of the exchange there was
preat excitement and brokers, fagged and
nervous with the leng strain of the great
bull market, found themselves in the
midst of a new form of excitement. Any
willing to buy stocks were almost torn to
pieces, where a few hours before all the
pressure was on the seller.
As for the outside speculators there were
not enough messengers available and the
telephone service was Inadequate for a
time to get their selling orders to the ex-
C The proportions of the slump are indi
cated bv the following principal declines:
Atchison &%: St. Paul, 9%: Rock Island.
8*8- Northern Pacific. 8; Baltimore and
Ohio, 714; Union Pacific. 7%; Missouri Pa-
Sfle Bft: New York Central, 6: Illinois
Central. 5; Wabash preferred, 5%: Sugar.
4: Atchison preferred, 4; Kansas and
Texas preferred, 4%, and practically all
other stocks between 1 to 4 points.
A rebound which followed was almost
equally violent. The bears had been so
long without any opportunity for profits
In the recent market that their eagerness
to cover and take quick profits at the de
clines caused some frantic buying. The
rally reached 4% in Union Pacific, 4^ each
in Atchison and St. Paul, 4 in Baltimore
end Ohio and Northern Pacific, 3% in
Hock Island. 3% in Missouri Pacific. 3 in
Manhattan and from 1 to 3 points in many
other Ftocks. The excitement abated con
siderably after the rally, but prices wav
ered in an uncertain manner, declining in
Rome cases agrain to within a fraction of
the lowest. The tone continued very fev
erish until the close.
To-day's dealings in the exchange were
Fpcond in magnitude only to Tuesday last
â¢when more than 3.514.000 shares changed
hands. To-day's sales were 2,936,000 shares.

"We believe that there is a growing rec

"If women would use as much intelli

evils of intemperance and impurity than
they could do by a century of voting. If
in the same way they would inculcate

regard for the rights of others in social,
commercial and' political relations, tiiey
could do more toward reforming these
conditions of society which breed anar

through legislative action. There is much

Wheeler and Wilson & Wilson that on
May 15 they would be ready to proceed
with the trial of Charles It Fair's con
test to the will. The object of this notifi
cation, in the opinion of Attorney Heg
gerty, is to get this contest out of the
way. but Mr. Heggerty said that inas
much as the case has been continued with
the consent of all parties for over two
years he did not now propose to be rushed
to trial or other action in the matter. He
stated further, however, that if no action
was taken by the attorneys representing
the executors to secure a further hearing
on the validity of the trust clause of the
will, just declared invalid, or if a motion
for a rehearing was denied, the contest in
stituted by Charles L. Fair would be dis
missed, for under the recent decision of
the Supreme Court he will come Into pos

GROCERS TO CELEBRATE
AT SCHTTETZEN- PARK
Annual Outing and Picnic "Will Ba
Ever since 1S71 the retail grocers have
done their celebrating on the second
Wednesday In May. This year grocers'
day comes on May 8. and the Retail Gro
cers' Association has almost completed Its
arrangements for the proper observance
of the day at Schuetzen Park.
"Grocers' day" is pre-eminently a fam
ily event. As much care and as many
prizes are set aside for the babies and the
women as for the grocers and the clerks,
and that is not a few.
This year there is to be over $4000
worth of prizes. These Include a silver
chafing dish set, a gold watch for the
clerks, a 550 cash gate prize and a list that
Is almost double what the association has
had to offer before.
There will be a distribution of candy for
the babies and fancy games and races,
together with target shooting, prize bowl
ing and dancing. Several special boats
will be run for the convenience of the
merrymakers.

the largest amount collected In any one
month since he has had charge of the of
fice. In April of last year the sum of $44,
694 -was collected. The contributing causes
of the increase are- the new licenses Im
posed on vehicles, which amounted to
$4000, and on bootblack stands, on which
1600 was collected. The San Francisco
Athletic Club also paid in $1200 for its an
nual license to hold boxing exhibitions.

District Attorney Moves
Against Chinatown
Landlords.
Seeks to Enjoin Leasing j of
Houses for Illegal
Purposes.
> Â«Â¦
District Attorney Bylngton opened the
fight yesterday under the State l?.w to
close the slave dens of Chinatown. SlXty
five suits were instituted by the people or
the State on the relation of the District
Attomev to enjoin owners of premises in
Chinatown from letting their respective
properties to any person or persons for
illegal purposes, and to restrain the keep
ers of such places from carrying on or
maintaining tsueh establishments.
Twenty-six suits were instituted against
the eullivan Estate Company, whose
properties are in Sullivan and Baker al
leys- A number of actions join the crooks
ebiato as defendant, the properties of
wl.ich are in Sullivan and St. Louis alleys.
Other suits were instituted against tne
loiicwing property owners:
In Harriett aileyâ Louise Barriolhet. G.
C de Sanchez. Lee Poon, Camillo Ja
quctle. David Devoto and P. Bordenaye.
In Spofford alleyâ J. B. Stampe. J. Buzille.

tin. On Pacific streetâ Jaquette. In Cum
Cook alleyâ P. Marsicano. On Sacramento
Btrcelâ Flora B. McDermott; also one in
Oneiua place. On jackson streetâ Henry
Yeoman.
The Homes of Chinese S>ives.
In the complaints District Attorney By
ingion alleges that the variuus streets and
alityt. named therein are open and pub
!ie - that the various premises are divided
into rooms ar.d apartments, and that
therein the keepers, who are joined as
deleiidants. have kept and maintained the
same for illegal purposes, and that for
years past the premises have been used
iiiid are now beins used by Chinese
vomea in violation of a State law.
The premises, Jt is further contended.
contrary to the statute of 1899, were and
are Itased by the defendants named with
tlie knowledge that they were to be used
for the purposes set forth. The property
owners named, the complaint continues,
are in constant receipt of rent from the
premises, with the knowledge that the
rnonevs so received for such rent are de
rived from the illegal earnings of Chinese
s!a\efc. and from time to time the dttend
anls have remodeled the premises to as
to better fit them for the unlawful pur
poses for v.-fcich they are now being: used.
1h<* rents derived from the premises, it is
set forth, are far greater than the rents
that could be derived from the letting of
the properties for any legitimate purpose
and far exceed a reasonable income there
from, considering their location and
value.
"Will Break Up Slave Traffic.
In conclusion it is averred that it is the
intention of the defendants to continue to
beep and maintain the premises set forth
and permit their use by Chinese women,
and that unless restrained by the court
the defendants will continue to keep and
maintain such premises, although they
constitute and are a public. nuisance.
Upon the tiling of the complaints tem
porary restraining: orders were issued by
Judge Dunne, and the cases were as
sipned to Judge llurasky's department for
trial.
District Attorney Byington said last
evening that he had been preparing for
seme time to move against the keepers of
the dens and the owners of the premises
In which they are situated. Associated
Tvitr- fc'm in the case is Attorney Andrew
.T. dun!**. The attorneys believe they
hsve crathcred sufficient evidence to war
rant the Issuance of an injunction in each
Mid every action instituted. If such ac
tirn follows it will go far toward break
ir.sr up the traffic !n Chinese slave women,
which is now flourishing, and force own
rr? of premises to let their properties for
lepal nnd legitimate purposes.
A corps of employes will be kept busy
to-day servine the owners of premises and
ncpupar.ts of the houses with the prelim
irary injunctions issued by the court. The
rcrcnrolQ to pool interests in defense of
the actions instituted will precede the
final battle in the courts.

PREPARATIONS
Committee Decides to
Cut Out Downtown
Parade.
Major General Shafter Is
Elected President of
the Day.
The general committee appointed to ar
range for the observance of- Memorial day
in San Francisco met at the Mayor's office
yesterday afternoon. Major General "Will
iam R. Shafter, chairman, announced the
appointment of the following committees:
Financeâ Horace Wilson, W. W. Montague
and A. E. Cohn.
Programmeâ T. C. Masteller. J. C. Currier
and A. S. Hubbard.
Paradeâ H, P. Bush, Thomas F. O'Neil and

and R. E. Dowdall.
Decoration and transportationâ George T.
Johnson, George H. Wallis, George W. Chap
lin. J. S. French, P. Cuimnings and J. B.
Lauck.
After long discussion it was decided that
the parade should begin at the Union
street car line terminal. Presidio Reserva
tion, at 10:30 a. m. There were many ob
jections to a down-town parade, but Gen
eral Shafter remarked that he could as
sign two troops of cavalry and a light
battery to join the procession from the
center of town to the National Cemetery
if a city parade should be demanded. The
discussion was participated in by J. C.
Currier, Horace Wilson. H. P. Bush.
Thomas F. O'Neil. T. C. Masteller. S. W.
Carpenter and others. It seemed to be
the sentiment of the committee that soci
eties and organizations desiring to parade
in the city could do so on their own mo
tion and join the Grand Army column at
the Presidio. The committee adopted a
resolution extending an invitation to all
patriotic organizations.
General Shatter said the quartermaster
general of the army had been directed to
provide a suitable place in the National
Cemetery for holding public exercises. He
also remarked that he would see General
Oscar F. Long, depot quartermaster, and
ascertain if the stand could be constructed
in time for the exercises on May 30.
On motioi. of T. C. Masteller, General
Shatter was unanimously elected presi

Oil Companies in Jbresno and San
Benito Counties Plan to Form
Association.
A meeting was held last evening 'in the
Mills building to form an association to
represent the interests of the oil producers
in the districts heretofore known as Pa
noche, Vallecitos, Silver Creek, etc., all
being located in Fre3no and San Benito
counties. For the purpose of definitely
locating the properties of the companies
in that section, a motion offered by "W.
B. Simmons was adopted which conferred
en the new organization the name of the
Fresno-San Benito District Association.
The idea was to have the wells mentioned
hereafter as In the Fresno-San Benito dis
trict. A map wa3 exhibited which showed
how the several names which have been
applied to practically the same section
tend to cause confusion of geographical
ideas. A committee of three was appoint
ed to arrange for bringing the companies
concerned as oil producers In Fresno and
San Benito counties into the organization.
The committee consists of "W. B. Sim
mons. D. P. Hocking and J. B. Hoss.
Temporary organization was postponed
until another meeting. Dr. C. T. Deane
presided and B. L. Davis was the secre
tary.
Crushed. Under a Xioad of Lumber.
Edward E. Galvln, a lumber hand in the

Water Front Notes.
The interisland steamship Helene went
on the Union Iron Works dryJock yes
terday and left a lot of trouble in the
of 1500 bags of empty bottles be
hind her at Pacific-street wharf. Rosen
berg & Son are dealers in empty bottles
ar.d during a visit to Hawaii youna: Ro
senberg gathered up the consignment in
question cheap. He got a low rate on
the Helene and sent the bottles here,
where the market is much better than it
is in Honolulu. Rosenberg Sr. claimed the
consignment on the arrival of the Helene
and, ioadir.g the sacks on wagons, pre
pared to cart them away. Then the Cus
toms authorities stepped in and demanded
to know if the bottles were American or
foreign. Rosenberg Jr. had forgotten to
remove the labels in Honolulu and that
was an expensive oversight for the firm.
All the sacks had to be unloaded from the
wagron and in spite of the Drotests of
Rosenberg Sr. every bottle was examined
and the dutiable removed from among the
non-dutiable. When the work was done
it was found that there were 300 sacks
of dutiable bottles, and as the dutv is
about IVi cents a bottle Rosenberg & Son
had to turn about $150 Into the United

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
The Magdalene will load wheat at Portland
for Europe at 3Ss 9d: the Najade, same voy
age, 3Ss Sd, both chartered prior to arrival.
The British bark Inverneil arrived from
Newcastle, Australia, yesterday after a
long passage of eighty-five days. She was
caught In a succession of pales that did
some damage about the deck, but nothing
serious. On March 22 last the Inverneil
was -within three miles of Pitcairn, but
no sign was seen of the islanders. The
bark brings a cargo of coal for the North
Pacific Ccast Railroad, so she was taken
direct to Sausalito as soon as port was
made.
Was in Heavy Weather.
The army transport Lawton will not get
away for the Philippines until about the
end of the month. While leaving one of
the small island ports she struck on a
sunken rock, but the damage was not
considered very great. Thursday she
Â¦went on the drydock and a thorough ex
amination was made. It now looks as
though it will cost $10,000 to get her ready
for sea. A new bilge keel will have to be
put on the port side, the rudder head has
chafed through the deck plate, a new shoe
Â¦will have to be put on her stem and quite
a number of rivets are started. The Law
ton was scheduled to sail on the 12th inst.,
but as the repairs will take three weeks
it -will be the end of the month before she
gets away.
Sailing About Three Weeks.
DAMAGE TO THE LAWTON.
Necessary Kepairs Will Delay Her
Maru, for the Orient, passed out
through the Golden Gate in company yes
terday. The Peru was to have sailed at
noon, but was half an hour late in getting
Into the stream and another thirty min
utes was wasted in picking up a crazed
passenger, who ,'umped into the bay.
A few minutes .> after the Peru had
moved away from the wharf one of tne
cabin passengers became greatly excited.
He Insisted upon being put ashore to say
good-by to a friend. The last heard from
him was when he yelled to his friend
to wait for him. When the steamship got
into the stream the passenger must have
eluded the sailors who were watching
him, for the people on the Fremont
street Â¦whaxf saw him clamber on the
ship's rail and jump Into the bay. VTiie
cold water sobered him and he started
to swim for the Peru. A Whitehall was
in the vicinity and the boatman picked ihe
swimmer up and transferred him to the
steamer's boat that had been lowered In
the meantime.
The cabin passengers on the Peru were:
St. John Robinson, Luis F. de Retana, Mrs.
K. W. Kinsey, S. B. Clapham. H. Mather, J.
Heinemaji, \V. S. Bardwell, J. B. Dennis,

Mrs. M. de Kspinosa, Miss M. de Esplnosa,
Concepclom Osuna, K. M. Knight, Mrs. N.
Morrison, James Farway, Jesus Barenta.
The Nippon Maru took away a very
large cargo. Purser I. U. Slocum did not
go out on the steamship this trip, his
place being taken by C. L-acey Goodrich,
formerly of the Coptic. Mr. Slocum will
enjoy a vacation. The cabin passengers
on the Nippon Maru were:

"She eaid her brother had also received
great benefits from leaving off coffee and
taking on Postum Food Coffee." Henry
A. Mader, 221 W. S2rd St. New York.
"One day on an excursion up the coun-
try I remarked to a young lady friend en
her greatly improved appearance. She
explained that some time before she had
quit using coffee and taken Postum. She
had gained a number of pounds and her
former palpitation of the heart, hum-
ming in the ears, trembling of the hands
and legs and other disagreeable feelings
had disappeared. She recommended me
to quit coffee and take Postum, and was
very much surprised to find that I had al-
ready made the chance.
"A lady said that perhaps coffee was the
cause of my trouble and suggested that I
try Poetum Food Coffee. I laughed at the
thought that coffee hurt me, but she in-
sisted so hard that I finally had some
Postum made. I have been using it in
pl&ce of coffee ever since, for I noticed
that all my former nervousness and irri-
tstion disappeared. I began to sleep per-
fectly, and the Postum tasted as good or
better than the old coffee, so what was
the use- of sticking to a beverage that was
ruininc me?
A New York hotel man says: "Each
time after drinking cotten I became rest-
less, nervous and excited, so that I was
unable to sit fivÂ« minutes in one place;
was also inclined to vomit and suffered
from loss of sleep, which got worse and
worse.
It is difficult to make people believe that
coffee Is an absolute poison to at least one
person out of every three, but people are
elowly finding It out, although thousands
of them suffer terribly before they 'dis-
cover the fact.

NEW YORK, May 3.â Bradstreet' a Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
______
NEW YORK. May 3.â This afternoon's Get
back in prices was the most -violent which has
occurred since the present bull speculation set
In. It was absolutely without cause in news
of anj"thing that would do harm to intrinsic
values of securities." commerce and industry.
A flurry in the money rate coming on over
extended speculative accounts Indicates the
whole situation la a nutshell. It is charac
teristic of a boom that it should continue un
abated to the very teeth of such a situation,
with every preliminary warning, but pushing
onward until the actual event forcibly checked
the advance. The danger has been obvious
that the speculation was overrunning the
bounds of reason and safety. The buying -was
admittedly without motive or Information be
yond the hope and belief that there
be enough future buyeis to lift prices to a
higher plane and so offer profits. There were
exceptions in the case of the great market
leaders, in which there were plausible theories
and reports of buying to change control. But
in these also the horde of speculators who
have tailed on precipitately to each movement
of this kind for several weeks past was a
very large element In the buying. Increasing
trepidation has been felt among commission
brokers and lenders of money who assume re
sponsibility for speculative buyers that many
of this class were stretching their resources
unduly, dependent as they are on the main
tenance of the prices cf securities to keÂ°p
their credit good. As a consequence there
has been increasing pressure from commission
houses upon their customers to take their
profit* and lighten their load. But the buy
. ing demand has been constantly reinforced by
nejvcomers and the inroads upon the market
extended. The preliminary figures of to-mor
row'e bank statement made it clear that only
a weak showing can be hoped for from that
statement, and the bankers began calling
loans to recuperate their position.
The call loan rate ran up to 7 per cenC and
the speculators began to manifest acute dis
tress as they found themselves forced to look
ebout for new accommodations. The extreme
sensitiveness of the situation was made mani
fest in the violence of the reaction by what
really was a moderate hardening In the money
rate. The delicacy of the 'situation was en
hanced by the furious speculation this morn-
Ing in Atchison, St. Paul. Rock Island, Balti
more and Ohio. Missouri Pacific and a number
of stocks influenced by these movements. Ad
vances of 3% to 7% had resulted during the
morning among these stocks, St. Paul' being
particularly buoyant. When the pressure came
upon the market these stocks were naturally
among th-r** which were most acutely affected
by the selling. Enormous blocks were un
loaded on the - decline at successive drops of
half to a point to many points decline. The
drop in Atchison reacued Â£%; St. Paul, 9%

between 1 and 4 points. The bears were so
eager to take profits after their long absti
nence that their demand to cover caused ral
lies among these stocks of from 2 to 4%. But
the rallies were not well held and prices went
off again In some cases to the lowest The

from 178%@18S(gilS5. Union Pacifies were heavy
all day at about 130%, slumping in the street
to 126. The market opinion here is that Eries,
Readings and Southerns are the only railway
stocks left to take in hand. Steel shares re
lapsed on profit-taking. They were dealt In
to-day in Amsterdam for the first time. Grand
Trunks were buoyant.
Call money and bills were steady.
CLOSING.
The activity and cheerfulness which have
prevailed In the market here for come time
were continued to-day. In the words of the
brokers, "Americans were first, the rest no
where." Indeed, in- this department the trad
ing was nothing less than frantic from start
to finish. The oscillation of prices was of
the most violent character, heavy waves of
profit-taking being succeeded by equal heavy
buying movements. New York took a hand In
making the mad seesaw swing, but in the
street this support vanished suddenly and a
sharp collapse ensued.

CHICAGO, May 3.â The wild course of prices
for May corn had "little to" do with gen
eral market conditions. Its manipulated con
dition was more than ever apparent. The
July delivery was comparatively as placid as
a summer sea, but it was at least an Index
to corn values when all the product In. sight is
not in the hands of one man. But the May op
tion was the center of attraction. Shorts were
panic stricken â¢ and bid the market up m tre
mendous leaps from 55c to '56c at the opening
to f8c compared with yesterday's close at 53%c.
Phillips, who. controls the market; sold 800,000
bushels to shorts between 56c and . 58c. Tail
ing longs, fearing that their leader was about
to unload, dumped their lines into the pit and
the maiket broke. to 53c before it was realized
that Fhillips was not yet prepared to loose
his hold.. HÂ«; sold nothing under 66c, at least
not openly, and the market reacted and closed
2c higher at 55%c. â¢Â¦ July opened strong and en
joyed a general demand for a time, but liberal
realizing caused a decline. Part of this" was
recoveied later in anticipation of wet weather
West. July , closed . a shade higher at 47%c.
-The wheat trade was fairly active, but the
strength with which the market started .under
the -influence -of light /Argentine shipments and
firm cables -fail s to hold. -July opened %c to
%c higher at 74%c to 74%c under a heavy. local
demand. -Southwestern people, apparently con
vinced , that Â¦ the crop â has , a > glowing : future
ahead of it, despite allegations of damage from
bugs, lice 'and Dies, started the selling, iwhlch
later became quite general among local people.

Wheat also attained a high point, advancing
in sympathy with corn. According to corre
spondents of R. G. Dun & Co. there is reason
to expect a heavy Bpring wheat crop this
year. In the principal States a full acreage
lias been planted and the . weather is most
favorable for Termination. On the Pacific
Coast and in other domestic spring wheat sec
tions, as well as in Manitoba, a larger area
than usual is devoted to raising wheat this
The marvelously healthy condition of busi
ness Is best appreciated when it is discovered
that the defaults last month were the small
est in ninety-one months, with the exception
of May to August, 1899, Inclusive. In manu
facturing lines there were but 163 failures,
with a total indebtedness of $1,997,694. against
178 last year for $4,514,003. As 1899 reported the
smallest failures of anv year in two decades,
last month's good showing is made manifest
by default in manufacturing concerns $777,975
smaller than two years ago. Trading failures
were 555, for $3,169,823, and banking defaults
were $529,000. . .
Further advances were scored in the cereal
market," Chicago speculators being forced to
cover May corn contracts at 55c. Attractive
prices brought more liberal receipts at interior
cities and also stimulated operations on the
farm, traders having forced the next crop
options .to what seems an unreasonable level,
since there is evidence of a large yield, de
spite delayed planting through excessive mois
ture.
There is no improvements in woolens and
Coates Brothers' average of 100 quotations of
wool on May 1 was 17.71c, against 11.99c on
April 1, and 22.76c a year agro. Small conces
sions are reported in a few grades of shoes.
Western jobbers are ordering more freely and
shipments from Eastern shops are larger than
in the previous week or a year ago. Leather
is quiet, .aside from activity in belting:.
Dullness Is still reported In the textiles. A
further reduction to 2 15-16 cents for standard
print cloths did not accelerate sales, as
buyers appear confident that goods will soon
be available at 2%c . "'
Stability of prices and vigorous prosecution
of work at mills Indicate the wholesome po
sition of the iron and steel market. Through
cut the entire range of products of this in
dustry the current demand for immediate de
livery exceeds all previous records, yet makers
maintain a conservative position and prices
are not pushed up to the danger point. It is
in the finishing steel plants that there Is the
greatest urgency for shipments and full ca
pacity la assured for the next three months.
After July there is a prospect of respite.
Judging by the light engagements of pigiron
and following the unparalleled activity of the
past six months, a season of comparative quiet
would not be surprising nor unwelcome. There
was a rush to get in orders for steel rails
before the higher prices became effective, and
the erection of new office buildings provides
a great demand for structural material, which
is also in considerable request on foreign . con
tracts.
The greatest activity ever seen In Wall
street diverts attention In a measure from
progress In distributing and manufacturing
operations. But while on every hand stock
market interests are counseling caution and
attempting to yrove that prices are really
more than the condition of some of our rail
roads warrant, the fact remains that, without
a brilliant crop outlook and a great activity
of general trade. Wall street could hold no
such carnival. Labor difficulties are fewer
and less threatening than for several years
before In the first week of May and prices of
merchandise hold well.

The preliminary figures of to-morrow's bank
statement indicate a gain in interior move
ment of less than $2,000,000 to offset the loss
to the sub- Treasury, which was reduced in
; to-day's statement by the payment of Govern
ment checks and bond redemptions to $4,715,000.
But the extent of the disturbances in the
money market to-day indicates that the avail

ably impaired by the* great demand of the
stock market speculation as well as by this
indicated loss in cash of nearly $3,000,000. The
easier tone of the sterling exchange market
followed naturally from the sharp demand for

of gold for export to-morrow.

advices on Oats were somewhat unfavorable.
Argentine shipments for the week were 920,000

last year. Later on in the session the market
broke. Rain was predicted in > the West and
Southwest, and St. Louis started in to sell

row will say: The sanguine feeling as to
trade and speculation finds reflection in the
enormous activity and stock speculation,
which has attracted much money from the
usual commercial channels and expanded
clearings to unheard of totals.
Warm, sunny weather is helping retail trade
in the cities and is likewise affording the
farmers favorable opportunity to | complete
crop planting. General business, the country
over, must be classed aa- satisfactory. The
Iron and steel trades, though reporting some
what of. a lull in the cruder forms, .continue
to furnish the best reports, while the textile
Industries return the least favorable accounts.
Wool la quiet, mills buying only to, fill im
mediate wants. There is more movement at
the -West and on the Pacific Coast, however.
London prices are higher â¢ for finer merino
grades and lower for cross-breds.
The crop situation at present Is quite encour
aging. Warm, sunny weather is helping corn
and cotton and wheat maintains a generally
good condition, notwithstanding reports of dam
age by Insects In the Southwest. Grain plant-
Ing is almost finished In the Northwest and
liberal rains In California have helped the
situation theere.
Iron trade production naturally appears to
be catching up with demands in the cruder
forms. Bessemer pisiron is 23 cents lower this
week and sales have been made of Southern
pig 60 cents below the asking price of some
weeks ago,/ although Birmingham reports
schedules arlhered to. Other metals are quite
steady, except as â¢ to tin, which is slightly
lower on the week.
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 5,100,763 bushels, against 4,
2S2.129 bushels last week. 4,637,033 bushels in
the corresponding week of 1900, 3.484.0S1 bush
els In 1899 and 2,923,775 in 1893.
From July 1 to date this season wheat ex
ports are 176,916,238. bushels against 166.035,802
bushels last season, and 201,195,468 In 189S-99.
Failures for the week number 163. as com
pared with 214 last week. 173 In this week a
year ago. 164 in 1899 and 240 In 1838. Canadian
failures In April numbered 103. the same num
ber-as a year ago, but liabilities aggregated
only $790,385, a decrease of 20 per cent from
1900. 7

Harrison's circular says: During the week
there have been seven coal arrivals from Wash
ington, 13.406 tons, two from Oregon. 1430 tons;
one from British Columbia. 3100 tons; five from
Australia, 13,612 tons; total. 33,548 tons. ThÂ»
above are the largest weekly deliveries we havÂ»
had for some time, although there has been
but one cargo from British Columbia. ThÂ» coal
shipments for last month were 30 per cent lesÂ»
than April of last year, showing conclusively
that fuel oil is asserting Itself very pro
nouncedly. Prices are well sustained for the
moment, although a number of our heaviest
coal consumers have been contracting for oil as
their future fuel. This conclusion has been ar
rived at after critical calculations, and to in
suÂ»e the receipt of their full requirements they
have purchased all they may need for tha next
one or two years from responsible venders. The
selling price leaves a very meager margin for
profit after deducting pipe line charges and
transportation. In fact, as the business Is now
regulated the consumer occupies a much morÂ«
preferable position than the well owner. SomÂ«
radical modifications must be Inaugurated, or
oil prospecting will markedly diminish, except
In such localities where the product can reach
a market by water, instead of by rail. The latÂ»
very seasonable rainfall should Improve outward
grain freights, and tend to depress Inward coal
freights from Australian and English ports.

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL
to bear this out. At the same time the de
clines had the appearance of constituting what
1b ..tensed", a healthy reaction. Though it is
customary for Wall street to argue that a
boom like the present one will not last, there
seems in this case to be an absence^of posi
tively unfavorable factors. The street and the
market . certainly disregarded the gold ship
ments, which for this week amounted to $3,
<o0,C00. and which point to the probability of
nn unfavorable bank statement. Fully $50.
000,000 of the new British consols have been
awarded to this country, . and a considerable
amount of gold will undoubtedly be required.
It may. be noted that the London market Is
taklnE great interest in the boom here, and
ha^, in fact, shared in it to the extent; of buy
ing considerable amounts of , United States
Steel stocks.

ecution was Policeman Hooper, who made
the arrest. He said that he did not see
any revolver till Mrs. E. M. Smith, Cole

President Fahy warned the legislators
yesterday that the march would occur. It
is proposed to assemble the miners next

from three points. The men between Ash
land and. Shamokin will move through
Treverton and Herndon to Millersburg.
where they will be joined by the march
ers from the Schuylkill and Luzerne dis
trict. The column will then move to
Harrisburg and by their earnestness im
press upon the Legislature the necessity
of having the new mining bills adopted
as laws.
Each man will carry a full dinner pail
and coffee bottle, and as It is expected
the march will not consume more than
three days the men will not go hungry,
as provisions will be donated along the
line by labor sympathizers. No riotous
demonstrations are anticipated. â¢

morgue were positive that it was all that
was mortal of John English. "Weeks
passed and English was forgotten in the

the supposedly dead man walked Into the

was emaciated and deathly pale, and
when he stepped through the door startled
workmen let their hammers fall and
gazed -in speechless j amazement. After
their astonishment had subsided explana

English all these weeks had been in the
hospital.. He was very near death's door,
but never in the morgue. How'his friends

bate on the Irish question by moving to
reduce the salary of the Attorney. General

jury-packing one of the most v flagrant
evils of legal administration in Ireland,
but that . the whole, system was "calcu
lated to produce abrogation of law, j and
to suppress individual and national , lib

the case of Patrick A.- McHugh, member
for the north division of Leitrim, who was
imprisoned because of editorial comments
he had made in the Sligo Champion.
John Atkinson, Attorney General for Ire

try members of the United Irish : League
by a: jury composed of members of the
league, men who, he asserted, regarded
the law of the league as higher than the

juries were selected by the crown in

that Catholics were not rejected as jurors
because of their being Catholics, v; It was
his own duty, he insisted, to take advan
tage of all means to remove from the jilry.

It is a weird scene. It Is in this chamber

AGED MEDICINE MAN
- SLAIN BY TRIBESMEN
Chief Tsnawashie Pays the Penalty
for the Impotence of His
Weird Incantations.
TACOMA, May 3.â Chief Tenavrashle,
one of the oldest Yakima medicine men,
was murdered at his home on the Yakima
reservation on Tuesday night. Two bul
let -wounds, Indicating that he had been
shot in the bax*k, and one showing- that
his assassins fired upon him after he fell,
give evidence of foul play. The body was
taken to Fort Simcoe and interred to-day
after the ceremonies and customs of the
tribe. An Investigation will be made and
the nerpetrators brought to trial.
"it is considered certain that the murder
â¢was perpetrated by some Indians who
were angered because of his failure to
cure their relatives, who died of smallpox
last winter.
Tenawashie was 80 to 100 years old. Dur
ing the hard winter of 18S1-82 he was a
prominent personage to all the residents
of Yakima Valley. He engaged in a Chi
nook dance with such barbarous enthusi
asm that he tore great pieces of flesh
from his arms by biting and clawing lo
appease the wrath of the evil spirit and
cause the winter to break. Cattle were
dying by the hundreds, and some of the
more superstitious .cattlemen offered the
Indians great sums of money if they
would cause the winter to break.
Tenawashie went from his hut on Tues
day night to look after his ponies ,and
was shot from the rear by enemies in am
bush His" aged squaw did not discover
his body until the day following the trag
edy. Â¦ --?.;â¢â¢â¢â¢-.â¢-- _Â¦ ' â¢

MANILA GAINS
A CIVIL RULE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 3.
A bloody quarrel ended a partnership of
ttrenty years' standing and almost cul
minated in a double murder to-day. The
quarrel -was . between Fred W, Gartner
and Bernard McManus, who have been
associated in tbe planing mill business for
a score of years and who are now con
ducting a business together at the corner
cf Fourth and Clay streets. Uke most
quarrels of that kind, there are two
Ftories of how it originated, but there is
no question as to the amount of damage
that was done to the partners. They went
at each other with hammers, clubs. Iron
pipe and pieces of scantling-, and when
they were separated both were so badly
injured that they had to be taken to the
Receiving Hospital for treatment.
The direct cause of the conflict was the
discharge of Gartner's son by McManus.
Both of the proprietors had their pons
Â¦working in the mill, and last week Mc-
Manus declared that young Gartner was
Fhirking his work and not obeying him.
This is where there is a variance in the
ctory. Gartner savs that McManus dis
charged his son, and McManus says that
he did not, but told the boy he ought to
quit If he could not work. At any Tate
Gartner went to the mill this morning de
-'termlned to discharge young McManus in
return for the discharge, actual tt sup
posed, of bis son.
The two partners did not seem to be able
to "get together" on the question, and
proceeded to m!x things very badly. Gart
i:er proved himself eligible for member
ship in any first-class "knockers' club" by
using R hammer on McManus' head with
mch effect that there were nine wounds
to be sewed up at the Receiving Hospital.
McManus had a little the worst of It
with the hammer-beating time on the top
of the head. Charles McManus. the son.
helped things along. Gartner was knocked
down and young McManus kicked him in
the face, breaking his nose.
After the men had been patched up at
the Receiving Hospital McManus had
Gartner arrested for assault "with a dead
ly -weapon, and Gartner announces his in
tention of having both McManuses, father
and son. arrested upon similar charges.
A dissolution of the partnership will fol
low.

arguments of "Attorney 'Otto'tum" Suden

THE DUTY OF MOTHERS.
VTazt suffering frequently results
i ron a motlitr's jgnorance ; cr more
frequently f rc3m a raother's neg-lect to
properly instruct her daughter ! ,
Tradition says "iroinan must suf-
fer,^ and yo-cng- women are so tang-ht."
There is a little truth and a great deal
of exaggeration in this. If a' young
Troman n suGers severely she needs
treatment, and her mother should see
that she gets it. Â¦
. Many mothers hesitate to take their
daughters to a physician for examina-
tion ; but no mother need hesitate to
write freely about her*' daughter.. or
herself _tQ Mrs. Pinkha^n and secure
the most efficient advice without
charge. - Mrs. Pinkham's address is
Lynn, Mass.' . " ;
Sirs. August - Pfalzgraf, of .'South
Byron, Wis.,~ mother of the young, lady
Â¦whose portrait we here publish, wrote :
Mrs/ Pmkham in January; 1899, saying
her.1. daughter had suffered ]foT .two
years vrith irregular menstruation"â j-
had headache all the time, and pain in
. her side, feet swell, and was generally
miserable. . .Mr6^Pinkham'< promptly
replied with advice, 1 and under date of
March, 1899, the mother writes again
that Lydia E. Pinkham's .Vegetable
Compound cured her daughter of; all
pains and irregularity.
; Nothing in Â¦ the : world equals Â¦: Mrs.
Pinkham's medicine ; for, regu-
lating woman's peculiar - monthly
troubles.
