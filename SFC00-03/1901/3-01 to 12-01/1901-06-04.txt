Host Noted Heart Specialist in the

J. Â¦ :/. Consultation.
NEW YORK. June 3.â A Journal special
from Washington says: That the physi
cians who have attended Mrs. McKInley
ever since her return to Washington re
frard her condition as most critical, was
emphasized this morning when Dr. Wil
liam Osier, of the Johns Hopkins Uni
versity, one of the most noted heart spe
cialists in the United States, was called
In consultation at the White House with
Drs. Rixey, Sternberg and Johnson.
When Mrs. McKInley was so critically ill
in San Francisco Injections of salt solu
tion and other heart stimulants were used
as a last resort with preat success. It is
loamed now that the attending physi
cians w*ere anxious to have an expert
determine exactly the effect such heroic
measures were having on Mrs. McKln
ley's heart, in addition to having their
general diagnosis of the case verified.
WASHINGTON, June 3.â Dr. Rixey, af
ter remaining in the White House for
nearly three hours to-night, said that
there ha/J been no change in the condition
of Mrs. McKInley. At 11 o'clock she was
resting comfortably. The complaint
â¢which manifested itself while Mrs. Mc-
Ivinley was away from Washington, and
which has so seriously sapped her
strength, has been checked, but its effect
has been to leave her 5n a very weak con
dition. At the White House to-night there
is a slight increase in cheerfulness, and
the hope is expressed that Mrs. McKin
lcy will again give evidence of the re
markable vitality which she has displayed
heretofore. There will be another consul
tation of the physicians in the morning.

Special Dispatch to The .Call.
NEW YORK. June 3.â The Press says:
One tremendous consolidation of all rail
roads operating between the Mississippi
River and the Pacific Coast promises to
result from the settlement of the differ
ences which caused the Northern Pacific
corner.* The Press is , able to announce
on the t highest Â¦ authority that not only
have the differences been settled between
the - Morgan-Hill faction . and the j Harrl
man party regarding the Burlington deal,
and the ' relations of that railroad and
the Northern Pacific and Great Northern
with the Union Pacific, but also that the
St. Paul, Chicago and Northwestern, and
the Chicago and Great Western will be
taken carÂ© Vrf in a great harmonization
scheme . of the trunk lines of the West. .
The exact details of the. harmony
agreement are withheld until J. Plerpont
Morgan arrives from Europe. He will
sail . for ' this country to-morrow. James
J. Hill, who has been his representative
In the Northern Pacific conflict and In
the practical management of the Mor
gan-Hill railroads, has been In the city
for . a week, arriving here several days
in advance of the time he expected to
come after the preliminary settlement In
regard to the Northern Pacific corner.
"Wait and See," Says Hill.
In Morgan's absence' Hill has remained
"incommunicado," . giving to his friends
the assurance; that they muat "wait and
see. B'acts will tell the tale In good
time." . * ,
In Hill's simple expression Is the whole
truth in a nutshell.
j The agreement : regarding the contro
versy, over the control of , the Northern
Pacific i means that the property'win-lre
main under the direction of tho Morgan-
Hill faction* . although the Kuhn-Loeb-
Karrlman-Gculd faction, backed by - the
Rockefeller and Stillman interests, own a
majority of the common and preferred
stock .combined,' and further, that the
harmony agreement will result in a closer
alliance between the great trans-Mlssis
sipp! railways which extend from Chi
cago to the coast and have affiliations to
carry American products to the far East.
Alliance of Big Railroads.
Just .how these arrangements of this
tremendous alliance of big railroad prop
erties will be carried out cannot be told
at this time, but it can be asserted upon
the highest authority that such arrange
ments, are making:: that there will be
harmony; that the Northern Pacific direc
tors will, include men identified with the
Union Pacific and- that the whole conduct
of the trans-Mississippi railroads will bo
on a basis that the greatest profit, will be
derived from a more perfect amity and
conccrd. '
Advance information that such plan
of "harmonization" was being: arranged
has stimulated " the prices of railroad
shares. *The upward movement -in securi
ties began last. week. It continued tp-day,
and the buying .was by Wall street's
strongest interests and was supplemented
by purchases for investment account.

RENEWS ATTACK
ON OUR ENGINES
Sir Alfred Hickman Says
They Consume Too
Much Fuel.
Claims' They Wear Quickly
and Are Lacking in
Strength. y
â¢ LONDON, June 3.â Sir Alfred Hickman,
former president .of the. British Trade As
sociation, has replied to" the response of
Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of State
for India, to his recent attack in the
House of Commons upon American-built
locomotives and bridges. He quotes from,
the rtport of the Burmah Railway Com
pany for the first half of 1900 to show that
American lqcomotives used on the line
burned 35.5 per cent more fuel per train tor
each mile and 23.5 more per vehicle for
each mile than British-built locomotives,
and he declares that the alterations al
luded to by Lord. George Hamilton were
made in the tenders only, so as to enable
the carrying of more fuel. After inquir
ing why certain reports have not been
published, he says: "The Burmah Rail
way officials seem resolved to screen. the
Americans at all cost." !
After Inquiring why, if American com
petition is founded on superior chemical
research and technical â¢ education, British
markers should be full of orders from
Americans to deliver immediately at any
price, he remarks: "Surely that is 'some
evidence that the world outside the Indian
railway officials considers British engines
and material better and in reality cheap
er. The official locomotive | engineer re
ports to the Burman Railway that the
engines show early signs of wear and
want of strength, and cheapness in the
first, cost is not true economy."
Sir Alfred then cites Egyptian railway
reports against Belgian engines and
quotes from an Assam railway i report,
dated April 16, 1901, as saying that Ameri
can locomotives take 24 per cent more
coal and 25 per cent more oil than Brit
ish. This, .Sir Alfred avers, conclusively
proves bad workmanship. He affirms that
the great advantages which continental
and American manufacturers have over
British manufacturers is due to what
practically amounts to export - bounties,
adding:
"The American engineer has a protected
market which enables him to make enor
mous profit at home and even to sell at a
loss abroad, still getting a satisfactory
return on his capital. I venture to assert
with confidence that but for the 37 per
cent dut y we would sell more engines In
America than the Americans send here."
Discussing the Gokties viaduct in Bur
mah, Sir Alfred says: "Lord George
Hamilton refuses to* give Mr. Constable
an opportunity to prove his statements
about the bad American work, on the as
surance of gentlemen who have proved
their partiality to the American Bridge
Building Company by showing them in
advance the private estimates for the
projected bridge over the Irrawaddy, and
who, by every shift and contrivance, have
endeavored to stave off the publication of
the reports of their own engineers."
Sir Alfred's long arraignment concluded
with a request for the appointment of a
committee to investigate the subject.
ACTHESS IS SLAIN
BY MAN WHO -LOVED HER
After a Desperate Quarrel Edward
' - Forshay Shoots Miss Edna
Stokes.
CHICAGO^June 3.â Edward Forshay of
Kansas CityT^n actor and assistant man-
ager of theatrical companies, to-night
shot and killed Miss Edna Stokes, an ac
tress, whose home is at Sedalia, Mo., and
with whom he was deeply in love. For
shay claims to have met Miss . Stokes in
St. Louis six years ago, -when they were
both playing an engagement. The couple
played in different cities of the country
until last fall, when they came to Chi
cago and became members of the stock
company playing at the Victoria Thea
ter. '
Forshay originally intended to take his
life after killing â¢ the woman, for upon
his person when Â¦ he was. arrested were
letters bidding farewell to his mother in
Kansas City, and another to Chief of
Police O'Neill of this city. "
The couple had engaged in a desperate
quarrel three days ago, and Forshay is
said to have beaten the actress badly,
cutting her head in two places. Miss
Stokes gave orders to the proprietor of
the Vernon Hotel, at which she was stop
ping, that Forshay should not be admit
ted to her presence, and although . - he
called there twice during the early part
of the evening, he was compelled to leave
by the attendant. Later he called, and
the proprietor told him that he could
wait in the parlor, where Miss Stokes
would see him. She came down from her
room and the couple talked for about ten
minutes, when Forshay suddenly drew a
revolver and fired two shots, one passing
through the right lung and < the other
close to the heart. She died almost- in
stantly. Afteu killing the woman, For
shay ran from the building, but was pur
sued and captured.

WASHINGTON, June 3.â Assistant Sec-

ment and Commissioner General Powder
ly have decided to send three immigrant
Inspectors to Porto Rico for permanent
duty. It is feared that the recent de
cision of the Supreme Court In the insular
cases may stimulate Chinese immigration
to Porto Rico, with the Idea that once
there they cannot be denied admission to
the United States. The Collectors of Cus
toms hitherto hare acted as Inspectors
and will continue to do so, but the need
for additional help In keeping the Chinese
out is apparent to the officials. From
now on the exclusion laws will be more
rigidly enforced.

BOSTON. June 3.â The trial of the libel
Fuit of Mrs. Josephine C. Woodbury
against Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy, head
0t the Christian Science church, which
was begun last week, was resumed to
<Jay. There was additional interest in
the case because it was understood that
Judge S. J. Hanna, of the First Church
of Christian Science, who last week could
not be found by the court officers, had
returned from a vacation and would ap
pear as a witness. Judge Hanna was in
court. : .
W. B. Johnson, secretary of the Board
of Directors and clerk of the First
Church of Christian Science. In'resum
ing the stand to-day, expressed a wish to
correct an answer made while testifying
last week. He said that he received a
letter from Mrs. Eddy between the time
of the reinstatement of Mrs. Woodbury
and 'her excommunication. The cross-ex
cmination of Mr. Johnson was then re-
Mimed. Mr." Elder, counsel for the de
fendjyit, objected to a question as to the
meaning of the words "mystery of in
iquity," contained in the alleged libelous
message from Mrs. Eddy to the church.
The court ru'.ed that the question be
answered but that the answer should
have no weight to 'show what was in
tended by Mrs. Ed>ly.
Judge Bell said the plaintiff must prove
two things, namely, that the defendant
intended the language used to apply to
the plaintiff, snd that her hearers and
readers so understood it- \
The question was then repeated to Wit
ness Johnson, who replied: "By "mys
tery" Is meant something which has never
!Â«een solved. As regards 'iniquity, 1 that
is something which the courts and church
people have tried unsuccessfully for gen
erations to define, and I am therefore not
able to explain what it meant."
Mr. Peabody then took up a letter writ
ten by Mrs. Efldy to Mrs. Woodbury on
March 24, 1S95. and reading the first par
agraph in which Mrs. Eddy denied that
she had any part in the excommunication
or Mrs. Woodbury, asked the witness if
Mrs. Woodbury had been excommunicat
ed at that time. Witness at/first answer
ed Vno," but when his attention was
again called to the matter by a subse
quent question, he said he wished to
change his answer to "yes."
Witness said that a message received
by him on. June 5. 1S95. read: '
"If Mrs. Woodbury is in this audience
the is not included in my invitation to vis
it Concord."
Mr. Peabody offered a copy of the rec
ord copyright cf the message, which is
entitled "Message to the Mother Church
by Mary Baker Eddy. Concord, N. H.,
May, 1890."
Joseph Armstrong testified to being
business manager of the Christian Sci
ence Publishing Aesociation.- which busi
ness is conducted by a board of trustees
for Mrs. Eddy, The ?nessage was copy
righted by him under the association
name as proprietor. "
Harry N. Nurn, an editor for the pub
lishing company, said that a copy of the
alleged libelous message read in church
was furnished to a certain reporter who
was present at The service.
Mrs. Clara E. Choate testified that she
was refused admission as a member of
the church, but attended the service
when the alleged libelous communication
was read. She said that she never un
derstood it referred to any one in par
ticular. .
William G. Xixon. publisher for Mrs.
Eddy until 18S3. did not know the atti
tude of Christian Scientists generally re
garding Mrs. Woodbury. He read the
alleged libelous communication in the
Christian Science Journal.
He was asked what his understanding
was cf the meaning of the passage and
Â¦who was the person referred to. His re
ply was: "Mrs. Woodbury, the plaintiff
in this case." - . ....
The last witness of the day was Judge
S. J. Kanna, who said he had been away
from the city seven weeks. He had been
a county judge at Council Bluffs, Iowa,
and was now a student of Christian Sci
ence.

Wolfe of Gettysburg, Pa., created a sen
sation in the Evangelical Lutheran Gen

a woeful lack of spirituality and Godli
ness in the denomination, and that the
fire "of piety burned low. He said:
"Our church, has.. suffered very serious

as loud voices "are heard for individual
ism and unbridled liberty; so long as the
general good must be subordinated to the
rights of private judgment, our progress
must halt and our institutions langufsh.

grown -cold. There is no disguising the

Congressman Woods has' received a tel

to the coast* Congressman Woods says
that it has been wrongly stated in a

that the Government . bears no part of
the expense, but that the committeemen
Individually pay their own expenses. Con

to the coast will' result from the visit.
The committee will see afl the locali

ALTURAS. June 2.â Unless the prompt
action of the authorities results In the
punishment of the lynchers of Calvin Hall,
his three sons and Daniel Yantis, the
tragedy of last Friday may have been
onlv the forerunner of an era of blood
shed that shall convulse Modoc County
for some time to come. Hall, the rene
gade white man. who took a squaw for
his wife and reared half-breed sons to be
his companions in thievery, was a man
of great influence among the Indians
from whose tepees he chose a wife. The
members of the tribe are enraged over
the lynching, particularly as one of the
victims, who was but a stepson of Hall.
was a full-blood Indian, bis father hay
ing been Mrs. Hall's first husband. While
there is no danger of an outbreak of the
Indians, it is quite likely that unless the
law avenge the crime they may seek
to revenge themselves by ambushing
and murdering those of ' the murderers
whose identity they discover. Modoc
County may thus see a bitter feud waged
between Its white and native inhabitants.
The redskins are closely watching the
trend of events following the lsâ¢chlnz and
make no attempt to conceal their hostility
to the whites since the tragedy.
Thus far little has been done toward
apprehending the lynchers. It is not be
1 eved the offer of a reward by Governor
Gaee will have the desired effect, and for.
the g r C Tson that no one Is likely to have
the hardihood to visit Lookout and at
tempt to discover evidence, that would
lead to the conviction of the guilty.. Nev
ertheless, the county t officials i seem .to be
v ircere In their desire to have justics
done. In order to relieve themselves of
the onus of the, inquiry, they have_ap
pealed to Attorney-General TireyL. Ford

TACOMA, June 3.â According to Dr. T.

soon to be included In the known gold
bearing region of Alaska. . Dr. Rys be
lieves that eold discoveries will soon be
irade oij Shumagin, or other of the Aleu
tians, which will cause a rush of gold
seekers thither similar to that to Cape
Nome.
Two years ago Dr. Rys prospected Una
male Island to see if sulphur deposits there
could be profitably worked. He found sul
phur in abundance, but could not ship it,
as that island has no harbor. At that
time several seal hunters and fishermen
found placer mining profitable and he was
told by other prospectors that the Aleu
tians contained both placer ground and
gold-bearing quartz. Most of the Islands
have good harbors, which are open the
year round, a great advantage in case Dr.
Rys* prediction conies true.

SPEEDS DEATH
TO A RANCHER
Intoxicated Man Com
mits Murder Near
Modesto. .
Edward J. Donnelly the Vic
tim of a Former Em
ploye's Rage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MODESTO. June 3. â One of the most
dastardly, murders ever recorded In Stan
islaus County was committed last night
on the Donnelly ranch, west of Modesto.
Following a trivial dispute, Frank Cebulla
shot and instantly killed Edward J. Don
nelly, the proprietor of the ranch. His
weapon was a rifle and the bullet entered
Donnelly's right breast, passing entirely
through the body.
Rancher Donnelly formerly employed
Cebulla, who is a worthless and dissipated
fellow. Cebulla .visited the ranch while
intoxicated last night. The nature of his
quarrel with Donnelly Is not known, but
It is believed he was ordered off the place
and ' retaliated Dy shooting the rancher.
Donivelly was unarmed and the killing
was cold-blooded. The murdered man was
37 years of age and was reared on the
ranch on which he met his death. He
was a man who had the esteem of all his
neighbors.
After the shooting Cebulla set his rifle
down and said he would go to Lagrange
and surrender, but no trace of him can
be found by the officers engaged in the
search. Some believe he drowned himself
in Tuolumne River, which is near the
place of the homicide.
. There is no telegraph or telephone com
munication with the scene of the tragedy.
Sheriff Purvis. District Attorney "Walthall
and Deputy Coroner Bowker have gone
to the ranch. \
The reservation of all public land to
actual settlers Is demanded, as is also the
re-enactment of- the Chinese exclusion
law, so enlarged as to include all Asiatic
races. It was decided to engage an editor
for the official paper of the federation in
stead of requiring the .work of the presi
dent as at present. ... . .
I The "Western Labor Union spent the day
in discussing proposed changes in' the con
stitution. They are all of a minor nature.

CHICAGO, June 3.â There was a double
sensation in the Premier stakes at'Haw
thorne to-day. -Garry Herrmann, the
great Derby colt, pulled up absolutely
last, bleeding badly, and has , probably
seen his best days as a racehorse. Herr
mann bled slightly after a short workout
last Friday, but it was attributed to a'
slight cold and little fear was felt" that
he would become a bleeder. To-day, < In'
his , first race since that time he was
making a fine spurt on the back stretch
and overhauling the leader. Operator,
when Winkfleld saw that his mount was
bleeding severely and pulled the colt up.'
This was not the only . sensation that
came out of the race." The judges mis
placed the third horse. Sliverdale came
along in the stretch and won handily by
a length from Operator. -.The' latter was
half a length in front of Omdurjnan/ who
was only a head in front of Robert Wad
dell. Eight lengths behind Robert Wad
dell came Edith Q,* but the judges posted
Edith Q's number third Instead of Om
durman's. ' The owners of all -three
ho rses â Omdur man , - Robert ! Waddell and

He sent a letter to the dentist after re

reduce the bill, and after - further corre

auditor on the bill. This explanation was
not considered satisfactory and a court

Probable Winners.
WITH the exception of tne fifth
race at Oakland yesterday,
when Mocorito was beaten un
mercifully, the favorites ruled
with an even, regular hand.
The play in the ring, which now consists
of nine regular books and two of the
field variety, was fast enough to keep the
chalkers and pencllers hard at work.
Hilary, the 8 to 5 favorite,. won the first
race without any great stress of effort.
Off well at the start. Ruiz kept Hilary well
up In front. Abba L contesting until the
stretch was reached. . Bagdad beat Abba
L out for the place, fof which there was
no excuse. Bagdad was posted in the
books at 50 to 1. a false price, considering
the company. â¢ '
In the second race over seven furlcnef,
after a perfect start, Alas, First Shot and
Prejudice separated themselves from the
rest of the field and went down the back
stretch in the order named. Alexander,
on Prejudice, a- 3 to 5 favorite, kept . the
mare in good position, winning easily.
First Shot worked in for the place. Por
matus getting the show. Something of
the slow order happened to Alas, who is
still walking- slow behind.
The two-year-old race over the five and
a half furlong route produced an excit
ing finish between Vasallo. Alexander up,
and Huax:huca. Martie Bergen in the sad
dle. After a long delay at the post on ac
count of bad acting horses and worse be
havior on the part of the jockeys, lrnia
A and Vasallo took the lead. After the
turn into the stretch Huachuca came up
like a. flash and it looked almost a ctr
tainty that the favorite. Vasallo, would
be beaten, but Alexander went to the bat
and ntsed out Huachuca for the purse.
Torso Maid, the second choice, made the
show.
Goldfinder. the favorite in the fourth
race, over the Futurity course, was no
where in the finish. Bozeman on Ivatie
"Wolcott carried off the honors, Frank
Woods scoring the place at (5 to 1 and
Canejo Just making the show.
Before the fifth race nothing but Moco
rito was heard in the ring. From 2 to 1
the price was backed to 6 to 5, some
money going in on Foul Play, the second
choice. Mocorito got away well iu ihe
start, led by a safe margin until well in
the stretch. Then the mucilage seemed to
be on her hoofs and the best Ruiz ii".a-Jt=
of it was fourth. Homage. 8 to 1. conJng
up and nipping the purse. Foul Play got
the r>lace and Dollie Weithoff the show.
When Ruiz got through on Cromwell in
the sixth race over the one and a six
teenth mile route there was a neck and
neck spurt from the paddock . to the
stretch with Pat Morrissey, the second
choice in the running. Lost Girl nipped
the show.
Track Notes.
Bozeman was set down five days by
Starter Mulholland for gay conduct in the
fifth race. While lining up for the start
Bozeman shouted. "Now come on, boys."
and the pack. came full tilt toward tho
barrier, which they all ducked in unison.
"Five days for that," said Mulholland,
and now Bozeman is on the ground again.
It was announced yesterday by Presi
dent Williams that the California Jockey
Club â¢will conclude the season of racing on
June 15.

The Board "of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print the ordinance fixing the
tax budget for the next fiscal year. The
rate will be $1,076. of which'. $1 will raise
$4,000,000 of the necessary funds for the
current -expenses of the municipal grov
ernment, which are estimated at $5,470,100.
The 7.6 cents will bring in the $285,000
needed for park purposes and $25,000 for
interest and sinking funds of park bonds
of 1S74-5. The other $1,470,100 of the mu
nicipal expenses will come from license
taxes and other sources of revenue. The
budget as passed upon, by the board at
its last three sessions was confirmed as
published, with the following exceptions:
District Attorney, raised from $36,200 to
J37.2S0; Police Judges. $21,600 to $24,000; archi
tect's department. Board of ) Public ' Works,
$9970 to $11,970. which allows for an increase
of the head architect's salary from J3000 to
$50CO; Health Department salaries, $56,iOO to
*o7,000: Park Emergency Hospital, $4000 to $9000,
providing the assessment roll exceeds $400,
voo.ooo. Â¦ . - I
Malison's Plea Successful.
Commissioner Manson of the Board of
Public Works made a pica for the restor
ation of the position of superintendent of
streets, which was stricken from the sal
ary roll at Saturday's meetings. Manson
resented the suggestion that his asso
ciate, Maguire. be delegated to supervise
street work, saying that Maguire was in
competent to do it. and further, that it
was the Board of Works' prerogative to
designate where its officials shall be
placed. Tobin's motion that $2400 be re
inserted in the budget to pay Superin
tendent of Streets Thomas* salary was
carried by a bare ten votes. Reed said
that the vice of the Board of Works lies
in the multiplication of bureaus and de
partments.
The position of Chief Sanitary Inspector,
held by W. P. Chalmers, which was
stricken from the budget at the last meet
ing, was restored to the salary roll. Reed's
motion that the items of the Health De
partment expenses be specified was . car
ried.
Director Denman objected to compelling
the Board of Education to expend J12.C00
for a playground south of Market street,
but the appropriation was allowed ! to '
stand. Hotaling's motion that the money
be transferred to the school fund for otheij
purposes and the Park Commission be re
quested to take the matter up was de
feated.
Stafford's motion to strike out the item
of Â£25,000 to construct a. police station at
Fourth and Clara streets was defeated. Â¦
Stenographers for Police Courts.
* Connor's motion that. $1080 be allowed
for a bookkeeper for the Warrant and
Bond Clerk was carried. The Police
Judges were allowed two additional sten
ographers at $2400 each.
Stafford's motion to â¢ cut the Justice
Court Clerks from five to four was lost,
as was also McCarthy's motion to pay
the janitors of the Hall of Justice $2 per
day instead of ?2 50.
Brandenstein made a plea to pay the
interest, amounting to $12,000, on unpaid !
back salaries of teachers. Tobin saw no
reason why teachers should be shown
any more preference than merchants_The
motion to pay interest en the claim^was !
carried,' Hotaling. Jennings, McCarthy, !
Reed and Tobin voting no. Tobin's mo
tion that the other creditors of the city
be allowed interest, amounting to $28,000.
on their claims was defeated. - > Â¦
The Mayor informed the board that the
Assessor had notified him that the assess
ment, roll would probably reach $405,000,000,
instead of $400,000,000. the basis on which
the budget was fixed. This allows $50,000
additional revenue, which- was appropri
ated, conditioned on the Mayor vetoing
the items should the roll not reach $405,
000,000, as follows: Repaving of Post street,
$20,000; repairs to schoolhouses, $10,000; in
terest on teachers' claims. $12,000; law li
brary. Hall of Justice, $2000. Any addi
tional surplus will" be utilized for the re
construction of streets and sewers.
The Mayor was authorized to appoint a
committee of twenty-five citizens to make
arrangements for the Fourth of July cele
bration.
Tho City Attorney filed an opinion that
the city may accept the gift from the
Mutual Telephone Company of an option
upon its franchise, but he doubts that it
Â¦would be worth-, anything as the i basis of
an enforcible right. '

Attorneys' John Garber and Moora
opened their side of the case yesterday In
the United States Circuit Court on behalf

pany. The whole of the forenoon was oc
cupied In putting in the exhibits, consist
ing maps, diagrams, photographs,
specimens of ore and rock and papier
mache models of the underground works
ot the "Pennsylvania Consolidated Mining
Company and of the Work Your Own Dig
gins Quartz Mining Company.
Before .introducing his exhibits Mr.
Mooro stated that he proposed to prove
by engineers and geologists that several
veins apexed within the surface lines of
the Pennsylvania, tfiat they pinched out
a short distance telow the surface and
that the mine was working on several
broken veins underground that had no re
lation to the ore bodies worked by the
Work Your Own Diggings people under
ground and within the surface lines of the
Pennsylvania. â¢
Mark B. Kerr, a mining engineer, was
the first witness for. the Grass Valley
Exploration Compaoy. He illustrated by
the maps, diagrams and photographs hi.-*
theory that the veins within the surface
lines- of the Pennsylvania mine ran in
different directions and even intersected
cue another, thus showing that they wers
not one and the same, and that there was
no true ledge in the Pennsylvania.

No one needs to be told to try to cure
t cough. But any . one will be glad to
be told of a means of cure which will
be thorough and lasting. Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery is â¢ a medi-
cine -which can be ', confidently relied
on to cure diseases of the organs of
respiration. It cures obstinate, deep-
seated coughs, bronchitis and bleeding
of the lungs. It cures when nothing
else will cure, and the local physician
says : "There is nothing more that we
can do."
There is no alcohol in tt Golden Med-
ical Discovery," and it is absolutely free
from opium, cocaine and all other nar-
cotics. . . . . ...
The dealer, Jempted by the little more
profit paid by .ess meritorious medicines,
will sometimes try and' sell a substitute
when the Â« Discovery " is asked for. , No
substitute medicine will -satisfy the sick
like Â« Golden Medical Discovery." It
always helps. It almost always cures. .
Â¦ "Two years ago a severe cough started on nie
and I was also bothered with catarrh," writes
Mr. P. Skjod, of Danewood, Chisago Co., Minn.
"I could not sleep nights, aa the cough was
worse at night. I tried several congh medi-
cines, but to no arail, until a year ago, when I *
got so bad I could not breathe through my nose
at times. I then tried Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-
ical Discovery. After taking eight bottles of
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical -Discovery, and at
the same time using Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy,
I am a well man. . I can thank Dr. Pierce for my
: good health,' and will recommend his medicines-
to any one suffering from the same trouble." .

MUSTERED OUT

THE SAN FB ANOISJDO : CALIj; 4^1901.
Rev. S. E. Wishard delivered. an address
on "Mormonlsm". before the Presbyterian
ministers' meeting and Rev. - D. - N. N.
Gillies of Ukiah spoke on; "Divine Mode
of Instruction" before the same ' bodv. â¢ .-Â¦Â¦_
While believing" in our hearts that for the
Government to go out of the. liquor business
must exert a salutary moral influence, and
believing that to remove' the , temptation to
drink from the soldiers must be. beneficial, yet
from the conflicting testimony gathered we
cannot at this brief period from the date of
closing the canteen, and with our limited op
portunity to gather the real facts, give an ln^
fallible prophecy as to what the ultimate re
sult at the Presidio will be; but we submit
to you and to the world 'the above testimony
and statements of facts as we now -find (.hem.
Rev. , "William - Woodward j Dr.
Gordon's book on "A New'Kporlh , "Kor 1
Faith,"' and ageneral discussion' followed.'
Â¦Â¦Â¦ A' nominating committee '.composed of
'Rev. E. P. Dennett'and Rev. Hugo Ccpe
land was appointed. â¢Â¦ . :
Dr. Taft addressed the Baptist Min
isters' Union on "Theistic' Evolution."* â¢
Tenthâ The united testimony of 'the " army
officers interviewed is to the effect that clos
ing the canteen was an unwise ; thing and det
rimental to the morals of the soldiers. ' The
testimony of the private soldiers, generally,
was that the effect of. closing the canteen had
been bad. We are not. in a position- to under
stand this testimony, neither are we compe
tent to deny it, nor to affirm it., s' Â¦
Believe It "Was Unwise."
Ninthâ We flnd -that more public notice :is
given to the drinking and boisterous . conduct
of the soldiers now than; when the canteen
was open. Inside, their conduct is hidden
from the police and -public eye; if a soldier
was drunk and boisterous from drinking in
the canteen he was â¢ taken away to his quar
ters and the facts were . known only to army
men. officers and privates, but his misconduct
outside puts him into .the. hands of the city
police, and the facts through 'the dally pa
pers are published to the world. '
Eighthâ But it is also a well-known fact
that the soldiers went downtown nights in
great "numbers while the canteen was open
and that they were ] often' drunk and boister
ous.' Â¦ . - * Â¦ . , â¢ Â¦ .*..
Sixthâ The post exchange at /the -Presidio is
stJU in' existence, minus 'the liquors, and It Is
conducted by a .Christian young man.' 'It is a
cleaner, more quiet place and largely visited.
Seventhâ The testimony . of the police and
army officers is that more of the soldiers go
downtown nights than while the canteen was
open; that when they come home from, down
town they are | often intoxicated j and boister
ous. - Â¦Â¦: , Â¦ .. - â¢ . .Â» -â¢Â¦
Fourthâ The licenses -of those saloon-keepers -i
who are now doing business there will ex
pire not later than the month, of July next,
and the ' Police Commission has . notified the
proprietors that it Is their purpose to refuse
any further license to sell liquor in Â¦ that , lo
cality. . As ~ fast as the present licenses ex
pire the saloons are being, closed. . . -
Fifthâ The testimony of the police,'watch
men and i residents ia \that . there \ is . not- ' now
any more drinking or disturbance outside the '
gates, ' in the - neighborhood.- of these' saloons,
than there was while the canteen was open
Inside.. Â¦ '. ' Â¦" ' ' â¢--'*--Â¦-,â¢Â¦' â¢ ,
Closing the Saloons.
Thirdâ There are now but five retail liquor
saloons doing business In the aforesaid local
ity and two places where liquor Is sold' by the
quart of more, but ' not drunk ; on the prem
ises. â¢ Â¦ " â¢' ' - Â¦- * Â¦Â¦-; Â¦ .... Â¦ ',.-
. Secondâ There ! have been Â¦ no â¢ new S saloons
opened outside since, the . canteen " inside was
closed, nor has there been one . new I saloon
opened ' there within the past' twelve months. . J
We have given this ' matter a thorough per
sonal investigation and have interviewed many
people, and flnd the- following: facts, Â¦ viz.: . .-
Firstâ There were sixteen retail' liquor sa
loons Just outside j the main entrance gate of
the Presidio ; when the canteen.was closed.".
. We, your commltteo,- appointed to investigate
the . truthfulness of the statements published
by the ; Associated Press to the effect that the
number of saloons had Increased; and drinking
â¢and rioting: were more common since the clos
ing ol the -post exchange or army canteen at
the Presidio, in San Francisco; and that the
closing. of said canteen had proven detrimental
to the morals of the soldiers Btationed there,

The Carrie and Annie, recently pur
chased by ths Foreign Missionary i So
ciety of America, was to have sailed for
the Carolines yesterday, but did not- get
away. Some of the cargo that will have
to come out at the first stopping place
was stowed in the bottom of the ship
bo the schooner had to be practically dis
charged and restowed. From, here the
Carrie and Annie will go to Honolulu
and thence to the Carolines and Mar
quesas. A small gasoline launch for the
use of the missionaries will be taken
along on the schooner's deck.

Joseph L. Eviston, fourteen days from
Kahului; bark Edward May, nineteen and
a. half days from Honolulu, and the
schooner O. M. Kellogg, twenty-six days
from Hana, all made port yesterday. Salt
urday night and Sunday the fleet caught
the same gale in which the Falls of
Clyde suffered and the Edward May had
her bulwarks stove.
There was some rivalry between the C.
D. â¢ Bryant and Edward May on the run
up. . In the storm on Sunday the May
had to be hove to and that enabled the
Bryant to creep up and get in first, thus
beating her rival by twenty-four hours.

Making a Long Voyage.
The ship Henry B. Hyde is making a
long passage from Baltimore to San
Francisco. She is now out 145 days arid
seafaring men are wondering if she is
not disabled. On January 30 last a full
rigged American ship was sighted in lati
tude 35 degrees 40 minutes north, longi
tude 56 degrees 40 minutes west with her
jibboom and her fore and main topgal
lant masts gone. On January 11 the
Hyde passed Cape Henry, and the place
where the disabled ship was Â¦ spoken
would be about her location on January
30. The chances are that Captain Me-
Leod is coming along carefully under a
jury rig if the ship should prove to have
been partially dismasted. . â¢
p-np^ HE owners of the British bark
J Artisan are now sorry they did not
I f>ell her to Uncle Sam. Had they
lL done so they would now be about
$25,000 ahead and the vessel would
now be serving- as a. coal hulk In Manila
Bay instead of being piled up on the
beach near Cape Patterson, Australia.
The Artisan left Newcastle, Australia,
last November for the Philippines with
a load of coal. The run over was made
in eood time and before the cargo was
discharged General MacArthur offered^to
buy "the vessel. The coal was for the
warships and there was no place to store
it until required. The bark was twenty
years old but sound, so the offer of Â£4500
was considered a fair one. Captain Har
dy submitted it to its owners, but they
took so Ion? in making up their minds
that he decided to go back to Australia
in ballast and lead coal for San Fran
cisco.
After the start was made all went well
until the Australian coast was reached.
Then a storm came up and seven of the
crew got so frightened that nothing could
be grot out of them, and on them Captain
Hardy lays the blame for the loss of his
fihip. While the Artisan lay in Manila
Bay nearly all the sailors deserted and
the captain was forced to fill their places
with two Chileans and seven Filipinos.
Of the latter .he speaks with undisguised
ccntempt and says that through the long
nfght of peril before the ship was wrecked
they were too frightened to move, and not
even the entreaties of Mrs. Hardy, -who
went amons them with hot coffee, could
get them to leave their hiding places. The
Artisan was cast almost high and dry
on the beach and the crew was able to
walk ashore on a plank.
The Artisan was built at St. Johns. New
Brunswick, in 1SS1, and was owned by \V.
Thomson &. Co. She was 10S3 tons net
burden. -1S3 feet 6 inches long, 37 feet 7
inches beam and 22 feet 4 inches deep.
Panama with merchandi5e for New York valued
at $91,112, and for Hamburg, $1060. The cargo
included the following:
For New Yorkâ 400 bales" wool. 99 ska corks,
212 sks. 8 pkgs shells, l'JS eks horns, 134,075 gals.

Clem : G. Moore, Editor of the Advocate-Democrat of Crawfordsvllle, Qa..
Â¦writes. the Peruna Medicine Company as follows: ; '.
Gentlemen: "After tour years of intense suffering, caused by systemic
catarrh,' which /contracted while editing and traveling for my paper, I have
been greatly relieved by the' use of Peruna. I gava up work during these
years of torture, tried various remedies and many doctors, but all the per-
manent relief came from the use of Peruna. My trouble was called indi-
gestion, but it was catarrh a/I through my system, and a few bottles of
Peruna made' me feel like another person, noting the improvement after I
had used the first bottls. Peruna is undoubtedly the best catarrh remedy
ever compounded. "âClem G. Moore.

DEVELOPMENT' OF THE. WEST.
V yr R. JAMES J. HILL of the Great Northern
/ V 1 aS recent ' y ma^ e an explanation of the pur
1 T 1. poses of himself and hrs colleagues in enter
ing upon the struggle for the Northern Pacific that
resulted in such a. tremendous excitement in "Wall
street. He declared emphatically: "It, is. not a fight*
between one section or city or road and another. It
is a big question of traffic development; . it. is a ques
tion of the commercial and industrial development of
the country at large. Our competitor is not in New
York nor in San Francisco; she is on the high seas.
Our problem is to get hold of the commerce of the
Pacific and bring it across the Pacific and across the
United States instead of allowing it to be diverted
around the globe via the Suez canal or Cape Horn."
By way of. making his view of the situation more
clearly understood he went on to say our population
is doubling every thirty years; . that from the landing
of the Mayflower down to the close of the Civil War
we had grown to 35,000,000, and since thftt time have
increased by 41,000,000, and that it is probable within"
thirty years more we shall have in the neighborhood
of 150,000,000. Of that vast number of people he estir:
mates that not more^than 50,000,000' can find support'
from manufacturing or commerce, because machinery;
has so increased powcrjin such industries that; there'
is not room for the .employment of more than one
third of the population.. Thus- the remaining 100,000,-,
000 people must find support from the soil in one way
or another. Â¦ , , . Â¦ Â¦ *_
Having laid down those propositions and supported,
them by an elaborate array of statistics^ Mr. Hill went
orTto say of the increasing number, of cultivators of .
the soil: "Where will they -go? Not to New England,
withtits rocky and unproductive hills. New-England,^
to use a . term in physics, is filled to. the saturation
point. Nor will the South take much of the increase,
with the exception. of the Latin influx from- Southern
Europe. ; No; the 'great increase will be in the valleys
of the "Ohio, Mississippi, Missouri and ' . w'estward,
the fertile prairies of A the great Central, West arid be- '
yond, wherever irrigation is possible: ' - ; Now, then^
what will these 100,000,000 on the land of the West
produce? Food,' will they not? They will produce the %
three^ great staples of traffic, food, fuel and shelter, b'ut
food in the main." . Â¦_,. . : â¢>
From' the employment of so, large a number of peo-"
pie in the production jof foodstuffs from a 'fertile soil
under a temperate sky/ there .\vill result an :â¢ enormous :
The British House of Lords is reported to have
authorized an overhead electric railway ' to run be
tween Manchester and Liverpool at a rate of no miles
an hour. The line is to be thirty-three miles long
and will make the two cities virtually one /so far as
facilities for going back and forth are concerned. '-

It would be difficult for any one but a British optim
.ist to take that view of the war, for it appears to out
siders to have, demonstrated thV military weakness
rather than the strength of the empire. Indeed, some
have been amazed that it has taken.such a vast expen
diture of wealth and of life on the part of the -British
to achieve so .little.; The army; has apparently been
utterly inadequate to its^work, and even yet is hardly
in shape to deal effectively with the "comparatively
small forces of theBoersV':*
There are some among the British themselves who
do not perceive the^ood results that Salisbury sees.
Thus Angus. Hamilton; in. the Pall Mall Gazette, says:
VARIANT BRITISH VIEWS.
T - ORD SALISBURY/ -in. the course of a'much
1 quoted speecK 'a few weeks- ago, congratulated
Â¦Ly tHe people of Great Britain that the expenditures
of the empire in treasure and in blood during the war
in South Africa have not been wholly in vain. \ Look
ing at wha't he called "the wider aspect of. the war^" he
said: "Irhas' had its lessons for ourselves and for
others. It has proved to the nations that we are still
capable of an' effort that would e_re this have exhausted
the -military strength of any other - people in the
world." After elaborating that point* he added: --"The
cause of peace is rkw more secure than it was before
the strength of England was conclusively shown.'V
Of the comparative urban and rural populations the
census shows a small increase in the rural population
in' Scotland but a decrease of such population in Eng
land, Wales and Ireland. On the other hand, the
towns and cities have increased. London now has
Â¦U.536,034, a gain of 307,717 since 1891. In England
and Wales there are now thirty places having 100,000
Inhabitants or more, as compared with twenty- four in
.1891. These thirty cities combined now^have some
ahat over 11,000,000 inhabitants, an increase of consid
erably more than a million in the past" ten years.
Over one-third, therefore, of the total population of
England and Wales now reside in cities Saving more'
";' ; than 100,000 inhabitants. Â¦. . ; V* >' -
-.^ /The shifting from rural to city life is going on in
' tvery part of the civilized world and is as notable here
â¢_'; is- in Great Britain. Some . authorities have seen in'
- :'rie change a menace to civilization because in their
judgment the cities can never produce as vigorous
.. aicn and women as the country.- It is doubtful, how
:: "-:vcr. whether that assumption is justifiable. The city
-'. ii to-day is a much more sanitary, place than the city
)f yesterday. It has more playgrounds for youth and
nore parks for the recreation of adults, and conse
juently it is not safe to draw from the experience of
he past conclusions concerning the future of urban
topulatioas. , .
The two' features. of the census which have attracted
most attention are the rapid increase of urban as com
pared with rural population and the* fact that Scot
land has for the first time surpassed Ireland in the
number of her people. The diminution of the Irish
population is, in fact, going on at a startling rate, and
is a proof of the utter failure of the British Govern
ment to provide for the prosperity of that part of. the
United Kingdom, while the increase in Scotland- at
tests its success there. Thus it has been pointed out
that in-i84i, when Ireland had a population of 8,175,
124, the population of Scotland was but 2,620,000.
During the intervening sixty years. the population of
Scotland has increased 70.6 per cent, while that of Ire
land has decreased 46.7 per cent. Scotland contains
less than 30,000 square miles, of which more than one
seventh is in detached islands. A large proportion of
the mainland is mountainous and unfit for* cultiva
tion. The fertile soil is no richer, if it is as rich, as
that of Ireland. Yet Scotland grows in population
steadily, notwithstanding a large emigration to Eng
land and all parts of-the world.
When the census was taken ten years ago the popu
lation was found to be 29,002,525 for England and
Wales, 4,025,647 for Scotland, 4,704,750 for Ireland,
147,842 for the lesser islands and 224,211 for army,
navy and merchant seamen abroad, making a total of
38,104.975. For this year the figures for the islands,
the army and navy and seamen have not yet been
given out, but the other figures show for England and
Wales a population of 32,525,716; for Scotland 4,471,
057t and for Ireland 4,456,546, a total of 41,454,219.
That in itself shows a handsome increase over the
census of ten years ago, and of course it will be con
siderably augmented when the population of the isl
ands and the army and navy abroad are added to it.
FROM the first recapitulation that has been given
out of the British census it appears the country
has made a better showing in the way of an in
crease of population than was feared by some de
spondent philosophers who have believed that the
vigor of the race is declining.

people of "Borneo are sparsely, scat
tered over the cduntry and chiefly con
gregate on the coasts. Here, they used
largely to employ themselves with piracy; Â¦
but now the custom . has . practically died
out. owing . to â¢ the repressive measures
rendered necessary, in the early days. The
Chinese form a. large proportion of the
population, and many people think, also
that several of the nativctribes owe their
origin to Chinese sources. The people are
intelligent and susceptible *to the* advan
tages of good, government, even though
this entails the giving up of such amuse
ments s\S' head hunting- and piracy.
In 1880 the British Government extended
a protectorate Over/ the territory . of the
North Borneo Company and thus Insured
the country .to the empire, while at the
same time leaving complete internal in
dependence.. Such a protectorate -safe
guards the colony internationally, while
It leaves the enterprising private com

The revenue is principaaiy drawn from
licenses for . purchasing and retailing
opium ana other excisable articles; the
rights of sale of which are farmed out to
private individuals. There Is also a poll
tax among the natives and a stamp. dutyr-
Another large item is the money derived
from land' sales. The revenue has grow*
considerably since lSS3,.when the company
first, tookup its duties. .. - . r Â« .

compared with- an expenditure of Â£65,300.
In 1SS8 the revenue had increased to Â£65,-
S0O and the expenditures had decreased to
Â£42,000. In 1S99 the figures were Â£107,764
and Â£84,012, respectively. Thus the propor
tion of revenue to expenditures shows
constant improvement. -,"
/^.There are many fine forests and timber

Camphor, gutta-percha, beeswax and sago
are among the natural products, while
sugar, tobacco and hemp are largely and
successfully cultivated. . There is some
gold -found and also mercury and coal,
but not in any surprising quantities.' The
excellent rivers afford cheap transport
and the Chinese coolies supply cheap la

.goes on economically yet'rapidly.

In this connection it Is of interest to
contrast the expenses of government in
1S87 of Fiji under crown | government and
British North Borneo under a ' chartered
company. Fiji; with an area of 7400 square
miles and a population of over 12S.000, ex
pended Â£73,000, and this in a year of rigid
economy; while in North Borneo, with an
area of 31,000 square miles and a popula
tion of over 150.000. the company expended
Â£29,000 only. This difference In expense
-is largely .to -be -traced to the. fact that
crown government generally requires es
tablishments large in comparison with' the
.resources of > the- colony, while the char-'
tered company enlarges its establishments
as the resources are developed. The crown

Dealing "With, the* Sultan of Sulu. ;
The early days of British North Borneo
were cheifly filled with the obtaining ot
concessions from the native Sultans and
s in , establishing trading .stations in ".the
country ceded by the Sultan.. 6% Brunei
and the Sultan of Sulu. In 1881 the British
North Borneo â¢.-Provisional Association
was formed; taking over the cessions com
plete. * The royal charter was obtained In
1381. and in 1882 tlw British North Borneo
Company was formed. For the: tarritory (
originally ceded the company pays annu-^
ally; a rent, besides which it has since ac-;
fjuired- many - additional pieces of terri
tory, either, by direct sale or by renting.
Both the Spanish and the Dutch Govern
ments objected c to. the, granting of the
charter- and the Â¦ acquisition of land, by a
company. â¢Â¦ The Spaniards, how
ever, in 18S5, together with Great Britain
and Germany,, signed a protocol, in which,
"the Spanish -Government * renounces, as
far- as. regrards^ the .Government,
a)l claims of sovereignty over the territo
ries of the continent oC Borneo, whicn be
long, or which have- belonged in the past,
to'the Sultan of Sulu.V ; â¢ â¢ "<
. At the time of iliscussiort in Parliament
upon the granting of the charter Lord
Granville, then- Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, made several remarkable
statements with regard to the
company. He wrote to the British Min
ister in Madrid:', ... . .
As regards the general features of the un
dertaking it is to, be Observed that the iterrl
torles j granted to the company Â¦ have ' been for
generations under -the government of the' Sul-'
. tans of Â¦Â¦ Sulu and Brunei, with whom - Great
Britain has bad treaties of peace. and com
merce; and far fRpm any disorders arising out
of the occupation of those territeries by British
subjects, under the concessions of the Sultans,
the advent of the company, has been welcomed
everywhere by the inhabitants. The experience
or three years shows that the peaceful and'ln
telligent development â¢ of the great . natural re
sources j of the country is I steadily i Increasing,
and there is every reason - to believe that a
sound and liberal system of administration will
be established â by. -the . company, "which- will

The experiments are. said to have been made .With,

apparatus which enabled ' the evaporation of 100V

it seems safe to assume that oil -is to' work, a great'
change in the world of industry. .â It remains to be
seen whether the people' of California and of
will ship their crude oil away : t6 be used for fuel in
Eastern factories or whether factories will be erected

pect now. for the-upbuilding of Western manufactur

CRUDE . OIL AS FUEL.

.^"-^ in California and -Texas the engineers of the
world'are giving more attention than ever to the eco
nomic advantages which may be expected to result
from the use of oil as, fuel. An English engineer if
reported to have stated recently that the oil discov-;
eries jn this country are more Â¦menacing to British
commerce and industry than any other single factor
of the time. Something of the same feeling with re-'
gard to the subject is felt in the East, and among the
Atlantic seaboard States : there is growing up,. a belief
that Texas oil can-' be shipped to their ports at so
little cost that they will have tuel cheap enough to
enable them to compete with' the coal districts and,
thus check the shifting of 'manufacturing from' 'the
Eastern States .to; the South and the Mississippi

to be. found for -the surplus. That market" Mr:.Hill
says .will be found in .Asia, : for the Asiatics will 'soon '
do, m Â°st of the comparatively ; small' amount of manu
facturing they^reqaif e^ and ;will , never Jbe rich '. enough
to demand much in" the .way, of luxuries, i -Their great -
demand will be for; food, '.and' as! a? consequence there '
will be an immen se traffic between' the Great Wejst'ahd
the -Orient.-. The only, question iiii. the problem, he
added, is "whether, that traffic shall- first ; be carried to :
Lthe Eastern ports 'of the '.United States and: thencei
shipped to -the Orient by way. of-the Suez canal or-by ; :
way of Cape Horn, or whVther it 'shall- be taken direct^
to . Pacific Coast pdrts^and shipped thence to Asia.; .^ |
* As to the part which ; -hÂ£and other railway magnates- j
are; playing in the evolution ;Â¦ of "commerce* Mr. Hill
said : "After all .is : said we railway managers are
largely automatons. in the shuttle. We must move,
as nature and. commerce dictate. We succeed, only.
as we obey the. great, natural laws;and the' public in-;

While there may be differences of opinion concern
ing some of- the statements of Mr.. Hill,- it will hardly
be denied that in the main his forecast -is as accurate
as can be^drawn fromj present conditions. It : is "; cer
tainly â¢ a prediction | that th'e' West . will fill

: This series of sketches of colonial gov
ernments would belncomplete if it did'not
include. at least one. case of land acquired
and developed by; a chartered;' company.
This system of subletting' portions of i the
British empire to private'companies-dur
ing ; the time of clearing and initial devel
opment has .been so successful that it "at
least ' merits consideration. â¢Â¦ Though there
is little doubt that" the companies must al
ways give way to crown government after
a time," they are: always anxious to "de
velop ' new/ country.' . In > return for the
privileges qf^the trading rights' iii' a coun
try, the company is prepared i.to. govern
the territory, and develop it, knowing that
after the" work ! of pioneering is completed
the Government will step in and take over
the duties of ruling, leaving the company
free to reap â¢ the full advantage of - the
trade in the settled and organized country."
It is certain: that under .the; company the
country is. developed much more rapidly
for the rapid opening up and development
.of the -company's, territory. >-.. '
â¢ The government of the colony is admin
istered by a. governor appointed by the
company,' with the approval' of the Secre
tary of State. He is the chief judicial of
ficer of the Supreme : Court â¢ and, "High
Court of; Appeal.'. The Governor Is as
sisted by a Colonial Secretary," two Resi
dents. of Districts and .several -Assistant
Residents. 'There are also officers for*the
Treasury. .Public Works. Harbor, Medical
and Constabulary "departments. "A Legis
lative Councils including the . higher offi
cers of the Government,- and* leading na
tive chiefs, is nominated. -The Indian
penal code is adopted almost - entirely,
though Â¦., there- are some proclamations
based upon acts current in Fiji. The .Brit
ish North | Borneo | Company 13 | bound to
respect the ; , rights : and customs of the
natives, one of which is slavery.- Steps
are, however, being- taken to put an end
to this latter practice: Â¦ - .
- The police force of 300 men maintains
order/ the members 01 the . force being/
offers admission to our. extensive market.
But both Congress _and the President have some-,
thing to think about besides the industrial interests
of the islands. The welfare of seventy-six millions of
people in the United States must not be forgotten. The
bonanza view of the Philippines has always been that
their surpassing richness of resources gives them a
productive capacity that is immeasurable,, and per
mits no comparison with a like area elsewhere in -the
world. One acre of land, there being equal in pro
duction to, a hundred acres here, similarly .employed,
to bring it into 1 action and admit its product into our
market free'means the obsoletion of a hundred times
as much land at home. This would be the case if
industrial conditions and "wages were equal. But. they
are unequal. Not only does the soil excel in rich
ness, but the labor that seeds and harvests there is
much cheaper than here, so much cheaper that the wage
that hires one man here will pay ten men there. Under
such circumstances free trade with the islands will
admit a competition against which the American pro-,
ducer cannot sustain himself. As, the first function of
American statesmanship is securing the welfare of our
own people, it seems evident that a tariff against the
land and labor of the Philippines will not become un
popular until the Republican protection policy loses,
its hold upon the people.' ." *-â* â¢ 'Â¦
The Chronicle assumes that an island tariff is de
manded by the trusts. That charge has been made be
fore, but we recall no instance in which proof of its
truth has been submitted* It was charged that the
sugar and tobacco trusts first bought all of those two
crops on hand in Porto Rico and then demanded that
a tariff be put upon its importation into this c6un- J
try. As such tariff added to its cost, we have been*
unable to see why its owners should' have been
anxious to increase their own expenses. We are un
able tÂ«-6ee how the trusts will be profited- by. a Philip-,
pine tariff. We do not dogmatically deny that they
will be, but we. ask. for proof before admitting it. Un
til this is forthcoming we. shall regard the trust argu
ment in the premises as an attempt to bring preju
dice into the discussion and decision of a question
which requires the highest use of reason and judg
ment. We submit as a more reasonable proposition
that the demand for free trade with the islands is made
by those promoters "who propose selfishly to exploit
them and tfceir people^for private' gain. It is notHnf
reasonable that this class desires to add to the profits
of cheap labor used on > highly productive land that
The San Francisco Chronicle, in, dealing with this
subject editorially, rebukes any ' proposition to im
pose a tariff' between the islands and the .United
States. As the court has decided in favor of . the
power to make such imposition, it becomes a ques
tion- of expediency solely. For its existence the.
papers which originally advocated annexation are re-.,
sponsible. The Chronicle sees but one side of it and
declares that. "any proposal to convene Congress to
put commercial shackles on the -Filipinos will come
to naught. As President McKinley will not be a can-.,
didate for re-election it is*suggested ,that he may pull
the trust chestnuts out of the fire by imposing an ex-
port duty, upon the Filipinos." The Chronicle then
argues that such duty would work the commercial
ruin of the islands. ._-. ; Â¦,"â¢
THE Cabinet is considering the expediency of an"
extra session of Congress to empower the Presi
dent to fix a tariff on traffic with the Philip
pines.' If the Attorney General >' fail . to find such
authority in the recent decision of the Supreme Court '
and the Spooner amendment to the army bill it will
be sought from Congress. As "the country approaches rj
the maze, of issues raised by these island annexations
it becomes plainer' that their administration ' will, re- "
quire considerable changes in our governmental meth-.
ods. The' administration' of government at such a
distance will present emergencies that cannot be dealt
with by Congress, either in regular or special session. -
The court in its majority -opinion has gone to -the
methods pursued by other nations under like circum
stances. Those methods are executive, and not legis
lative. It may be expected, therefore, that the power
of the President will be greatly enlarged in respect to
these, islands, if they are to continue in our pos
session and the needs of their government are to be
promptly met. â¢

THE FAVORITE, FLORENCE ROBERTS
"La Tdsca" at Grand Opera House Magnificently
Performedâ Neill Company Splendidly Presents
"Colonial Girl "-The Orpheum's Great Bill
THE SAK FBAyCISCO OALIi, TTJESDAY^ JtHSTE ;4, 190^
Flatt and Sutherland, vocalists and in
strumentalists, are the other newcomers.
Henry Lee, the character impersonator,
liad three new characters last night,
Koosevelt, Schley and Dewey, and they
wer"e lifelike. Lew Sully, the monologist,
was as good and funny as ever. The
American biograph concluded the bill.
Central.
There is enough patriotism In "Old
Giory," now running- at the Central The
ater, to stock half a dozen plays, and the
audience cheers the more striking parts
where the old flag is most honored. The
stock company does very well with the
drama, which includes a sea scene and
seveial others that "bring ! down the
house." The play is on for the week.
Chutes.
The Chutes has another good bill this
week. The flying Jordans continue their
sensational aerial act, introducing several
new and daring feats. Murphy and Hart,
comedians and dancers, scored a big- hit
with their laughable skit. Clinton Mont
gomery sang several new illustrated songs
in a pleasing manner. Other good num
bers are: Baby Ruth Roland, the clever
child artist. Mile. Adelaide on the high
wire, the Gillen trio of club jugglers and
new moving pictures!
Fischer's Concert House. . . .
Charity Martin,' the operatic soprano,
scored a success at Fischer's Concert
House last night Her voice Is well tuned
and her method is excellent. The Matil
dita ballet demanded six encores, and. the
singing of Sam Holdworth, lyric tenor,
was thoroughly enjoyed. Katherine
Kreig and Minnie Huff presented a one
act operetta by. Offenbach, a pretty thing.
Carroll, the whistler, and numerous other
vaudevillians concluded the programme .
Olympia. .
The bill at the Olympia this week is one
of the best . this year, and last evening
every number -was well* received. The
Samoyoas made cuite a hit with" their
aerial work and Frank Barton's ragtime
specialty received encore after encore.

Millions for Baseball.
A million of dollars are spent every year up
on the game of baseball, but large as this sum
Is, it cannot begin to equal the amount spent
by people in search of health. There is a sure
method of obtaining strength, and It Is not a
ccstly cne. -We urgÂ« those who have spent
much and lost hope to try H-ostetter's Stomach
Bitters. It strengthens the stomach; makes
digestion easy and natural, and cures , dyspep

TALENTED ACTRESS WHO
HAS MADE A HIT IN "A CO
LONIAL. GIRI*"
THE return of Florence Roberts to
the Alcazar stage last night at
the opening of her usual summer
season was the signal for a very
flattering demonstration in honor
of the clever little actress. She brings
Â¦with her this time a new play, "For Bon
nle PHnce Charlie," dramatized from
Coppee by J. L C. Clarke, a Buccess of
Julia Marlowe's, that was given here for
the timt time last evening. As its title
implies, "For Bonnie Prince Charlie**
concerns itself with Jacobite times, and
with the particular days about the bat
tle of Culloden. The story is cleverly
wound around the fortunes of a young
beggar girl, who becomes a spy for the
picturesque Scotch hero, and who, to save
him and her beloved Scotland, does not
even stop short of placing herself In euch
a position that her reputation as a good
Â¦woman is lost.
At first hardly grave enough, Miss Rob
erts' conception rises later to a very con
vincing degree of tragedy, and her.. Mary
is ail round a worthy and pleasing, piece
of work. She received an ovation, flowers
galore, and curtain calls innumerable.
.White Whittlesey distinguished himself
by a Ferious and noble portrait of the
blind beggar, certainly one of the best
things he has ever done, and a thoroughly
effective use of an admirable opportunity.
Frank Bacon, Edwin Enery and Jack
Morris were also fully satisfactory, but
the rest of the support lacked vitality.
Next week "The Countess Valeska" will
be given. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Columbia.
"The Importance "iff Being Earnest."
with its bristling epigrams and bubbling
wit, drew a fair-sized audienee at the Co
lumbia last evening. The comedy will
hold the boards for two more nights and
the Wednesday matinee. On Thursday
evening Mr. Miller will present a double
bill. "Gudgeons" and the one-act piay
"Frederic Lemaitre," in both of which
he been seen here before, and to splendid
advantagre.
California.
A well filled house greeted the second
performance of "A Colonial Girl" at the
California last evening. The play wae
well received and the actors heartily ap
plauded at the end ot each act. John W.
Burton was particularly good as the iras
cible old colonel, while James Neill made
an acceptable lover. Miss Edythe Chap
ir.au,: as Lady Danvers and Mi^s Ju'ia
Dean, as Molly Heddin, added greatly <o
the strength of the play. The other parts
wÂ«re-.well" filled, s
"A Parisian Romance." which was tirst
presented here by Richard Mansfield, will
oe -next week's attraction at the Cali
fornia. .
!.-.--Â¦Â¦ 7 Grand Opera-House. -> .
The Baron Ecarpia is one of Melbourne
MacDowell's. strongest roles, and his por
trayal of the pious' villain, who murders
between prayers. Is a purely artistic tri
umph. Coming so soon after the "La
Tcsca" of Â£arah Bernhardt,it was not ex
pected that there would be as much In
terest as there 'was displayed last night,
but the talent of Mr- MacDowell and the
fact that everything he plays is beau
tifully and correctly staged and cos
tumed was sufficient to fill the house on
the first night of Sardou's tragic drama.
TivolL
"The Toy Maker" began its fourth week
of success* at the Tlvoli last night. A big
house attested to the opera's popularity.
It Is a long time since . the Eddy-street
house has put on a piece that has so well
met the taste of the theater goers, and It
looks as though the tuneful opera Is des
tined to outlive' "The Idol's Eye." Annie
Myers is at her best as the doll, and In the
role is inimitable. Hartman has eomo
new Jokes and verses for his topical song.
The whole performance is an admirable
one. On Saturday next the Tivoli grives
another toy souvenir matinee for the chil
dren. ;, - *
Orpheum.
Grace- Van Studdiford continues the
topllner at the C^pheum, and her eongs
last night were warmly applauded. She
wa<? in splendid voice. Among the new
comers Miss Florence Bindley made a
meet favorable impression. She la clever
urid her Imitation of a French lady slng
fr.g "The Harp That Once" In a London
. drawing-room Is immensely good.. Hines
and Remington 1 : unique 1 character artists,

ing. She Â¦ established herself au a prime

CHICAGO, June 3.â Disappointing cables, ai:
increase of â¢ quantity > on passage and reports
of rains exerted a bearish Influence at the
opening of the wheat' market. Under liberal
offerings the July wheat opened %@'/Â£c lower,
at 74%<3 l 75c. Nearly all the wheat, put out
was taken quickly by a few commission houses
which apparently had instructions to buy ir
respective of crop conditions and thenceforth
the weather ceased to be a factor. -The crowd
that had sold early. . having learned where
their wheat was going, clamored to buy back
at the market. It was rumored that a large
commission house, said â¢ to ' have bougHt ten
million. bUKhels of July last week, was pre
paring to execute a squeeze. This became the
ruling influence and July advanced sharply to
76%c. The temptation to take profits resulted
In a reaction to "G^c, but under bull support
and an unexpected big. decrease In the visible
the upward movement was resumed until 77c
was reached.' Here the leader; credited with
building the corner, put out 75.000 bushels and
for a moment the market declined Me. Hold
ers of long lines were obstinate, however, and
again the price ; advanc&d, shorts bidding to
78%c - At this price there was considerable

Canned Apricots in England.
The London Grocers' Garette of May 18 says:
"California n fruits continue to meet a moder-
Bt<= demand, chief attention still being devoted
to the settlement of the duty question. A
merting of dealers and ethers interested In the
fanned goods trade was held on Thursday at
the London Chamber of Commerce. The pro
â¢t-cdings were not open to the press, but we
learn that a committee was formed and a let
ter drafted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer
protesting against the proposal to charge a
duty of 7s per cwt. on tinned apricots. We
understand that the cubtoms authorities con
tend that tinned apricots should have been
taxed under the heading of dried plums, etc.,
r-vfn before the imposition or the FUgar duty,
and that the omission to impose the taxation
war an oversight; but this is manifestly incor
i*ft. as fruit preserved 'in sugar* was exempt
ed prior to the sugar duty, the customs tariff
utatinj? â¢plums not i>retÂ«erved in sugar/ In
addition to this we ar<Â» informed that the ques
tion of payment of duty on plums preserved
in Mjpar was specially raised some years back,
duty being demanded by the customs, paid
under protest, and finally refunded."

exchanged for bonds -.o be Jointly guaranteed
by Union Pacific, St. Paul, Great Northern
and Chicago and Northwestern. The specula
tion was largely based on â¢ general considera
tions, such' as time has demonstrated that
the panic had effected no Impairment of the
prosperous business conditions, bo that with
the speculative losses adjusted a renewed ad
vance was In order. The unimpaired earning
power of the properties and the renewed accu
mulation of capital, it is argued, point to re
newed demand for securities. The belief is
prevalent that still further large readjustments
in the relations and holdings of the great rail
way systems, looking toward additional stabil
ity of conditions, are still in contemplation,
and it is argued that the panic in itself may
have facilitated efforts to concentrate holdings
of railroad securities with these ends In view.
An easier tone in the exchange market * indi
cated less probability of gold exports . this

vertiser's London- financial cablegram says: . -.
The tone of the stock market to-day was good
and business was considerably better than on
recent days of stagnation. It was in' the Ameri
can department, however, â¢ that activity was
most marked, and these ' shares furnished the
bulk of business. . The buying of < Americans
went on steadily throughout- the session. Buy
ing for the American account was a feature,
but sagged off somewhat . toward the ' j close.
Prices rallied as a result of buying â¢ on the
curb after the exchange closed. . The favorites
were Eries- and Southern Pacific, but the.feat
ure was easily United States Steel. Predictions
were that 'a. dividend of . 4 per. cent would be
declared on. the common s^ock next month.
Silver was harder.

Cheese continues plentiful and unchanged.
There are still a few lingering northern or-'

has adopted the following resolutions:,
Whereas, It has come to the knowledge of
Painters' Union No. 73, through the public
prints of Saturday, June 1, that the "Brother
hood of. Painters, Decorators and Faper-hang
erR" were, on May 31, admitted to member
ship "in the San Francisco Labor Council;
and, whereas, Painters" Union No. 78, com
posed of 800 members, is the largest local body
representing the Brotherhood " of Painters,
Decorators and-. Paper-hangers on the Pacific
Coast; therefore be it â¢ . Â¦. â -
Resolved â¢ By Painters' Union No. 73. in reg
ular session Â¦ assembled, that the ' report re
ferred to is untrue, erroneous and misleading,
inasmuch as Painters' Union No. 73 has nbt
been, admitted to membership in the San Fran
cisco Labor Council, for the reason that the
said union never made application for such
membership, nor did It at any time ever con
sider the advisability of affiliating with the
San Francisco Labor Council.' ; .
The "brotherhood"' that Â¦ was admitted to
membership in the Labor Council last Friday
night Is' the retinue composed of about
eighteen- members, ... known â¢Â¦â¢ as No. 156, and
which holds a charter against the expressed
desire of the organized painters of San Fran
cisco, and which: at the request of Painters'
Union' No. 73 was refused recognition by the
Building 4 Trades Council a year ago, and
which was later also refused membership . in
the District Council of Painters. .-.Â¦- .\ .
Painters'. Union No. 73 wishes It understood
that the only: local central bodies- It is at
present affiliated , with is the Building Trader.

Council 'of Painters, - and that it is entirely
satisfied 'with its present, affiliations, and fur
ther do wo wish' it known that the so-called
' 'Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators ; and . Pa

in the San. Francisco Labor Council/ consists
of "some eighteen nien who f f or -Rome reason of

" The carrip ' grounds are surrounded* by
timber and orchards. There is plenty of
water and a few; electric * lights, but the
latter will not be very, much -, needed.. It
is the expectation to have the camp well
settled .by Saturday night, June 8, Â¦- when
the advance guard will have finished its
v/ork and the companies have come down
and taken possession. ; It will .break up
the following Saturday. ,; J .-Â»
On a ridge to the south and west of the
main camp is the place arranged for the
tents of the division commander, his staff
and the division headquarters. Then In
order along the ridge to the north and
east are the Sixth and Second Infantry,
forming the Third Brigade, both camps
but one company deep ajid correspond
ingly wide. Then comes the Fifth and the
First Infantry and the artillery battal
ion, forming the Second Brigade. The
Fifth Infantry will be camped with the
nine companies abreast.- The First will
have two battalion streets after the for
mation of the Model Camp .at the Pre
sidio gate. The artillery battalion will be
camped in similar formation and just be
side the First Regiment. Some distance
beyond the Second Brigade will be camp
ed the twelve companies of the Seventh
Infantry in a triangle, six companies on
the base, then four and. then two. Just
beyond the regimental headquarters will
be the headquarters of the First Brigade.
Across a gulch from the division^ head
quarters will be the three Blgnal corps,
the two troops of cavalry and the stables,
where there will be room for 450 horses on
the picket ropes. Behind . the division
headquarters will be the division hospital
and In front of it the flagstaff, with the
flag In view from all parts of the camp.
The nature of the ground and the ridges
and gulches cutting through it have made
it necessary to lay the camp out In both
company and battalion streets, and when
the tents have been pitched and the divi
sion has been fairly settled there will not
be much in camp building that will not be
exemplified in Camp Gage. - -
The drill and parade ground Is a pla
teau of perhaps forty acres, with nearly
forty more added' to it by adjoining ridges.
There is plenty of room for all the regi
ments.to drill upon it and for the big re
view which will greet the Governor when
he visits the camp, probably on 1 Friday,
June 14. . . Â¦ Â¦. â¢ - â¢ ._,_ . Â«
The- site of the camp is what is' known
as Laveaga Heights and the camp Itself
will be known officially as Camp Gage.
The grounds are cut by numerous gulches,
and the first problem presented was how
to arrange the various brigades and regi
ments bo as to give all room enough and
still leave a large drill and parade ground.
This work fell to the engineer officer of
the division, Lieutenant Colonel Draper,
and he has laid out as complete and com
pact a camp as could well be made.'
Next Saturday afternoon the -big divi
sion camp of the National Guard of the
State will open in Santa Cruz, where al
ready the grounds have been laid out for
one of the largest- camps that ' has ever
been planned for the rriilltia of . California.

TO ALMA MATER
IN appreciation of the many years of
untiring labor which he has devoted
to the cause of education as professor
of history in the Stanford University
Dr. George Elliot Howard was pre
sented yesterday by his former pupils
with a magnificent silver loving cup. The
Â¦presentation took place In this city at the
professor's residence, 1457 Clay street. So
secretly had the students arranged their
plans and made their preparations that
the honored instructor was taken com
pletely by -surprise.

great benefits which the pupils had gath

ing that as a teacher and as a friend he
had helped them, as a man Inspired them
to a higher plane of life, and that they
had seen in him a devotion \o an Ideal
which made truth and righteousness su
preme.
Although greatly moved by the display
of affection on the part of his former
pupils, Dr. Howard made a brief re
sponse. He said that if in any way he
had ever fulfilled the higher responsibili
ties of a teacher he was satisfied: In
referring to the speech which ultimately
led to the discontinuation of his connec
tion with the Stanford faculty, he said:
"In my speech against the new policy I
showed the highest loyalty to Stanford
University. "When an institution is in
the wrong its best friend is he who points
out that wrong, thus enabling It to avoid
future error."

calling for the expenditure of nearly
$1,000,000, Is what an Eastern syndicate of
fers to create if the County Board of Sup
ervisors will grant the application for,
franchises made by George T. Dunlap of
Gllroy this afternoon. More than 100
miles of road Is proposed, and every sec
tion of the county will be reached, while
Dunlap says the men he represents have
plenty of money and are prepared to carry
out their plans at once. The capitalists
back of the enterprise are undoubtedly
those who recently bought the water
rights at the head of the Coyot Creek,
near Gllroy, and from here the power will
be furnished for the roads. Forty thou
sand acres of land was procured there.
Preliminary work for an immense storage
dam has been done, and altogether $200,000
has been expended. The title to the land
rests In Dunlap, but be admits that he
only represents outside capital.
- Should the proposed roads be construct
ed they will place San Jose in a position
to control the trade of the valley. Mr.
Dunlap. In, company with his attorney, C.
W.. Cobb, presented the petition for the
franchises to the Supervisors this after
noon. He urged action at once, saying
the capitalists he represented were anx
ious to commence work.
The road will have seven different
branches, as follows:
Alvlso - to San Joseâ Starting at Eliza
beth street in Alvlso and thence along the
Alviso and San Jose road to the northerly
limits of this city.
San Jose to Gllroyâ From the southern

tended to Hollister and "Watsonville.
San Jose to Los Gatosâ Out San Carlos

far es the general public Is concerned,
were it not for a small item in the Wil
lows Journal of June 1, announc
ing the return to that town, from
a life term in Folsom prison, of Patrick
Brick, convicted of murder in Colusa
Ooui'ty about fifteen years ago. Brick
killed a man named Jones in a saloon
row in Jaclnto.
Even with this information to hack the
request for news, nothing could be as
certained at the Governor's office with
reference to the issuance of the pardon.
The : Call correspondent telephoned to
Warden Wilkinson of Folsom prison and
from that source learned that Brick had
â¢been given his liberty several days ago,

from Governor Gage bearing date of May

had been searched for information which
every citizen has a right to demand and,
under the law to receive at the Govern

had been granted was officially admitted.

GOT OUT.
The Food Cure Brought Her Out With
Flying Colors.
A lady in Laurence, Ind., Mrs. M. C.
Waring, was a poor judge of food and
also a worker in literary and educational
lines, where she exhausted her vitality
because of the bad combination of a load
of work and poorly selected food to
rebuild her.
She was using hot cakes for breakfast,
meat, coffee, etc., and gradually lost
ground until she became a total wreck.
She Bays. "I was so reduced that the
ellphtest noise brought a cold perspira-
tion all over me. Sleep was out of the
question and my appetite was gone. I
was apprehensive of all sorts of disaster.
I became really very ill. I was on the
verge of losing my mind when one day a
friend who eat at my bedside remarked i
that she would bring me something nice i
Xr> eat, - Â«
Sure enough when she came over she i
had a dainty luncheon on a tray with
pretty decorated china dishes, etc. A cup
held ' some coffee, as I supposed, and a
dish held some hard, brown granules,
and she told me that was Grape-Nuts
Food, whereas the liquid was Postum
Coffee.
I liked the taste of the Grape-Xuts with
a little cream and ate all of it. After
some persuasion I drank the Postum
Coffee and that night was the most
.peaceful night I had enjoyed in months,
V*>,nd when I awakened in the morning: I
found the Grape-Nuts package on the
tab'.e near my bed, and I had some for
breakfast with some Postum Coffee.
V I at once began to feel better and dis-
carded all kln.ls of medicine, stimulants,
narcotics, and used only Grape-Nuts
four times a day with Postum Coffee. At
the end of thirty days I left my bed and
Hfter three months building up on Grape-
Nuts Food and the famous Postum, 1
have taken up my literary work, work-
ing harder than ever making up for lost
time.
M<::ital strains have no more terrors
lor me. I keep my mental faculties
clear. All ny inner organs have become
vlear and healthy so I never know I
have any, yet I work and study ' sixteen
hours out of the twenty- four on an avcr-
Rgp. 1 oftan wonder what has become of
those dreaiful nerves. Things that for-
merly dlsturted me now seem trlflÂ°s.
A healthy body Is a happy body, so I
EO about einringr and happy, come sun-
shine or rr.in. Grape-Nuts and Postura
lifted me out of a sick bed. and Grape-
Nut* Food has since brought my little
daughter. through a severe case oÂ£ scar-
let fever. Grape-Nuts â¢ was the only
food Fhe could' take and the doctor said
ehe would have died had it not been for
the nourishment given her by Grape-
Nuts Food. Do you wonder we believe in
the famous food?"
There is a reason why the Postum
Coffee and Grape-Nuts are towers of

with this dreadful maladj. . You may carry this poison in the blood for years, but
as the vital powers begin to wane a slight bruise or cut,* wart or mole, sore or
pimple may develop into Cancer. From middle life to old age is the time when
the slumbering poison is most apt to break out, a sore or ulcer often degenerating
into Cancer, and Tumors become more progressive and ulcerate through the skin,
the sharps shooting pains causing the most intense suffering.
-i Â¦< ."Â¦; The Cancer patient naturally grows despondent as one after another the usual
remedies fail," and the sore shows no ( sign of healing. The impuritiesthat have
been accumulating in the system, perhaps for generations, cannotbe eliminated nor
the poisoned blood made pure by salves, washes and plasters. The proper treatment
is to purify and build up the blood, remove the cause; when the sore or ulcer heals.

After being taken to the City Prison
Clayton begged Desk Sergeant Mellody
to give him a drink.
"Please see that I get a drink of
whisky," he piteously pleaded, as tears
coursed down his cheeks. "To be locked
up without being given some liquor means
that I will never be able to appear in
court to defend the charge that has been
placed against me."
Clayton's request for whisky fell upon
deaf ears, and without much ceremony
he was thrown Into a cell.
"I did not steal the funds of the trans
port," he declared later to a reporter.
""Whoever says I did lies. I don't care to
discuss the matter now, but when -the
case is heard in court I will be able to
show that I am innocent of any wrong
doing. .
i "Since I left the transport I have been
on a spree and did not know the authori
ties were looking for me. Had I known
that they were searching for me I would'
have lost no time In surrendering my
self."
Despite Clayton's statement the Federal
authorities claim that they have a clear
case against him. "When he left the trans
port he was accompanied by F. L. O'Xeil.
who acted as his assistant during the last
trip of the Sheridan. They rented a room
in a lodging house on Third street, but
slept there only one night. Clayton says
he became so drunk that he forgot whers
he roomed, and, after wanderingf about
the city "drinking his head off." as he ex
pressed it, he went to the house on Castro
street where he was arrested.

As far as the police are concerned they
areas far from a solution of the mystery

ported. Â¦- Unless the murderer surrenders

the awful murder of the unfortunate boy
will forever remain a mystery.
In a statement to I>etective Gibson yes
terday Mrs. Berry, In the absence of her
husband, who is a "Wells, Â¦ Fargo Â¦& Co
messenger, declared that it was on Decor
ation dayâ five days after the commission
of the brutal crimeâ that the chickens
were killed. She showed the detective the
ho tchet which, was used -in putting: the
chickens to death, ' and thoroughly ex
plained the circumstances attending the
incident. â¢ . > . .. -
After running down, every clew and
closely "questioning the people who live in
the immediate vicinity of the tragic oc
currence the head of .the detective depart
ment has come to the conclusion' that a
burglar did not commit the awful crime.
The ; condition . of the house, according to
the police, when the body -was discovered,
bears out the theory that robbery was
not the motive. While the bureau draw
ers were pulled out and the closets ap
parently ransacked the police are satis
fied that this 'was done in order to con
ceal the real motive for the terrible deed.
Yesterday Detective Tom Gibson located
the man who killed the chickens in the
vacant lot opposite the Hislop residence
on l>ecoratlon day. .His name is O*M
Berry and he lives at 100^ Haighf street.
A yellow sheet, in its mad endeavor to
mislead the police, claimed that the chick
ens were killed on the afternoon of the
murder and that the hatchet which was
used In decapitating the fowl was the one
which the detectives found contiguous to
tho .Hislop residence several hours after
the crime was committed.
Captain Seymour and his men, after a
thorough investigation, are satisfied that
revenge and \ not robbery was : the motive
for. the brutal murder of. Robbie HIslop.

accepted his proposal. Subsequently, she
a lieges, Carter, without cause, refused to

RIVAL FACTIONS

Citizens * Are Preparing
for the Primary
Election.
The Next State Campaign Is
Claiming Attention of
y Wire-Pullers.
: The Republicans of the several assem
bly districts of San , Francisco will prob
ably make up their lists of delegates to
the municipal nominating convention Re
gardless of either faction of the County
Committee. The indications are that the
Board of Election Commissioners will
make the apportionment in a manner. that
will give each district fair representation.
Leading members of the Republican
State Central Committee hardly expect
to be called upon to recognize either loca^
committee of the party. The sentiment
exists that it would be much better for
the community and the party if good citl
aens who are concerned,in the welfare of
the city should assemble in their respect
ive districts and nominate first-class del
egates and then support the nominations
at the primary. "
Shculd a clash occur between the Bou
vier and Tilden committees and the State #
central organization be called upon to ex
ercise the power conferred by law to rec
ognize one body or the other, the State
Committee for consistency's sake might
be forced to declare In favor of the Til
den Committee, which sprung from Mar
tin Kelly's B'nai B'rith Hall Convention.
Kelly and his followers were recognized
by the State Convention at Santa Cruz
when the issue was raised in the cam
paign of 1900. As matters now stand, sev
eral comnjitteemen would rather resign
than recognize Kelly again.
Will Recognize No Factions.
In the Forty-first district no attention
will be paid to either county committee.
The regular Republican Club of that dis
trict, of which Horace Davis is president,
will elect the delegates to the Municipal
Nominating Convention of the party. The
membership of the club embraces so many
active and well-known tax-paying citizens
that its supremacy as a political organiz
ation of the district cannot be successfully
resisted. The club Is oblivious to the ex
istence of factions. The fact' Is recog
nized, however, that a primary election
for delegates to the municipal conventions
will take place on Tuesday. August 13,
and that men of character and good
standing should be sent to the Republican
Convention. At the proper time this club,
representing all the elements of the Re
publican party in the district, will join In
preparing the district ticket of delegates.
Republicans in other districts may de
cide in favor of the course acceDted in
the Forty-first. It is essential that Re
publican merchants, property owners and
workingmen of each district should come
together and agree on the general propo
sition â¢ of putting forward tickets com
posed of decent citizens. As the election
will be honestly conducted under the pro
tection of the law, the votes cast by citi
zens will be counted. Decent men will
vote when they have the assurance that
ballot box stuffing: and the wholesale de-
Ftryction of ballots will not be permitted.
When one is reasonably certain that a
vote given to an honest candidate will
not be counted for a rogue, there is some
inducement to attend the election.
Voters Should Register.
Voters who have changed their resi
dence since the last general election must
register anew in order to vote at thÂ«Â» pri
mary election on August 13 next. There
can be no better time than the present
for attending to the important duty of re
registration. The office of the Registrar
at the City Hall is open every week day.
AH citizens who were properly registered
for the general election In November last
and who have not changed residence since
that time may vote at the coming pri
mary. New registration throughout is
not required. Only those who have moved
from one place to another should re
register. Of course, initial registration
for "twenty-onesters" Is always in order
Politicians appear to be reserving their
energies for the State campaign of 1902
when member-? of the Legislature. Con
gressmen and a Governor must be chosen
The Legislature to be elected next year
win be called upon to ballot for a United
States Serator, and it Is quite well
known that Senator Perkins Is a candi
date to succeed himself. It appears that
Gage and Perkins are no longer at "outs"
in a political sense. Two years ago at
the San Pedro celebration, the Governor
blazed away si the Senator, while the
latter sat on the platform as the guest
of the Los Angeles folk. For many
months thereafter neither one sought the
society of the other, but times and polit
ical expediencies have softened their
wrath.
Wiio "Will Be TYTnnagerP
The question is often asked. "Who will
nanage Perkins* campaign for the Sen
atorship"? Billy Hamifton, It is said is
so fixed at the custom house that he can
not get away from his official station to
do outside politics, hence he is not count
ed as a probable manager. Since Per
kins' election five years ago. Milton Green
has had so many unlucky bouts in the
political arena that he is not regarded
as available. There is not so much con
jecture regarding Governor Gage's polit
ical manager. All gossiping politicians
assert that Daniel Kevane is the trusted
apent and spokesman of his Excellency
\\ ord comes from Sacramento old-timers
that the Governor cannot be seen with
out the consent of Kevane. History of
Dam and Stoneman Is repeating itself
When Stoneman flourished H. J Dam"
tho executive secretary, held the ap
proaches lo the State Capitol and permit
ted no one to see the Governor until the
nature of the business which the caller
had in mind was fully set forth. It is
the same old Ftory told again. Kevane
must be consulted before the Governor
can be seen.

MISS ROSAMOND RODKINSON,
who claims that for the past
six years she has- assisted her
father in the stupendous work
of translating the writings of
the Talmud and thereby won the favor of
local society, finds time for less literary
pastime, judging by her experience of the
past twenty-four hours.
Early in May Miss Rodkinson arrived in
this city and registered at the .Palace Ho
tel. Her fascinating manners and charm
ing personality had their effect on the ho
tel reporters and the lady was written up
at length as one of the greatest . writers
of the day. - . .
Some of the morning papers published
the pictures of Miss Rodkinson and also
told at length of her career in literary
circles from the -Atlantic to the Pacific
and from the border line of Canada to the
surf-swept Chores of the Mexican Gulf.
San Francisco society hailed Miss Rod
