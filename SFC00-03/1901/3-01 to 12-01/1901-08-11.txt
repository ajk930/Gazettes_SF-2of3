him. 1 "Won't they tall down when the

balloon car," he said, and grew remi
niscent about the historic "balloon" that
was afterward supplanted by the Larkin

X cable cars standing in line at the
foot of Market street, ready to
march at the signal, propelled by a power
unseen. But to Ag&lestein Castro cable
cars were as new and unknown a thing
as automobiles.
For he has been shut up for thirty long
years, Bhut up within San Quentin walls,
and he is beginning to find that a good
many things have happened in those
. thirty years.

has learned to carry your voice for hun

She has grown as clfc\er as the young

Agglestein Castro came to San Fran
cisco the other day tor the first time in
thirty years and he tried to say the'ap
propriaui thing. -, He couldn't.
Tnirty years ago he shot a man. That
is how it came about' that San Quentin
got hold of him.- He doesn't remember to
this day that he did it; but atter the
mescal began to work off they told him
that a saioon keeper was dead by the
Â¦work of his six ehooter in his own
drunken hand.
Agglestein Castro is a native of San
Francisco whose name dates back to the
days when fandagos and bear hunting
were more important to this coast than
shipping and railroading. He counted
among his friends those who bore such
names as Noe, Bernal, De Haro and Vai
lejo. The young men of these families
were his fellows on the bear lassoing ex
peditions: they were his rivals at the
dance. Most of them are dead and the
rest have forgotten him.
"That's where 1 was born, fifty years
ago," he said, pointing to the summit of
Telegraph Hill. There where the old
castle stands is the epot which, together
with acres and acres more of land, be
longed to the Castro estate.
The father was a wealthy man. He.
together with two or three other Mexi
cans, owned over $100,000,000 worth of land
in the State. The others died poor, but
Agglestein says that his father buried his
money somewhere on Telegraph Hill.
He never told anybody the spot, how
ever, so it is no better to be his rightful
.--Â¦beir than to be anybody else with a spade
Vn that hill. The father died when Aggle
ktein was still a young man; he was
thrown upon his own resources, and he
took his mother and his sister and
brother to San Diego. There he attempt
ed to support the family on his income
from sheep shearing, while his mother
made tamales and his sister Querita took
in sewing.
The next thing he did was to fall in
love, then to be jilted, to take to drink,
to get very drunk, to shoot a man, and
to be shut up for life in San Quentin.
Having been an ideal prisoner, he is now
at the end of thirty years out on parole,
and if he lets licuor alone he will have
his pardon from the Governor. He is now
working for Mr. Kohn at San Anselmo,
where he was taken directly from prison,
and it was only the other day that he
made his first visit to town.
"This ferry-beat goes by a different
route from what it did when I came
across here the last time," he said. "I
was going- In the other direction," he
added.
Thirty years ago, when he crossed in the
other direction, he was a young man of
20. Now, although only 50 in years, he is
70 in feeling. Ke is an old. bent man. He
is Rip Van Winkle returned, and not even
the <icgs know him. â¢ .
"There wasn't any Tiburon then, and
the boat made a long trip in a roundabout
fashion and wound up at ' Point San
Quentin." he went on.
"That's the way they took me. Up by
boatâ there wasn't any other way to go to
San Francisco from the south then. I
hear now there's a train that brings you
up here â two roads, aren't there? But in
ffiose days a steamer vf&s the onlv means.
I "After we landed at San Francisco we
took the old ferry. Well, if we haven't
stopped already! and it used to. take the
most part of the day to cross;."
He was surprised at being alreadv on
this side of the water, and he was thor
oughly dazed at what he saw when ho
left the boat. The Ferry building stretched
before him. mazelike, with its complex
Â» exits and entrances and corrals.
"Why, it used to be a kind of a shed,"

When he came out on the town side of it
he wanted to stand back and "size it up.*'
end had started to do so when he caught
fiiKht of the -cable cars which he took for
automobiles.
"They are a wonder, 6ure," he repeated.
When they were explained to ' him he
gazed in rapt admiration at the "no
pushee-no-pullee." He was a little sus
picious of them, for all that. He mounted I
a car with a firm grip on the rod and he
sat gingerly in liis seat, as if'he expected
the thing to run away and wanted to be
preparei to jump.
Along Market street he stared stupidly,
like a dumb animal. The giant buildings
were strange to him: the Intricacies of
Etreet cars bewildered him: the thrones of"
people on the streetsâ driving, walking,
wheeling â all confused him.
The old one-story buildings that he had
known were replaced by many story office
buildings, stores, hotels. Where St. Ig
natius Chut ch .had been a landmark, at
the fo.Â»t cf PowieJl street, stores now rose
and filled tVte land to the last Inch. WhÂ«re -

He was very â¢ much delighted to be told
. that'it was still in use, and, later on, to
. be shown it in the same ' old place.
"But you might, think the Chinamen

Â¦ -_ "Dupont street was good enough in my

"It was the ord El Capitan that used to
take us over there," he went on to ex
plain. "It ran between here and the Oak

The mole is new to him.
"It's a. big heap of dirt. It must h*vÂ«
taken plenty long to T>u lid up. There was
a good -job for some rellow that diln't
have cash."J . -^
His mind runs on hard times, for they
are associated with his last recollections
of San Francisco.
"And the trains?" he asked. "I suppose
the trains run down 1 the coast to San JoaÂ«
just, as they used to?"
He was assured that they werÂ« just aa
they used to be.
"I'd like to have a 'look at them, Juet to
see them coming- In and going out again.
I used- to /watch them a lot. Yes, It's a
lazy man's trick to watch the trains, and
I had a. lazy streak in me. But when I
worked, I worked. That's because I'm a
Mexican." Â¦
When he" was told that he might go to
the station, he tried to lead the way. HÂ«
did not leave the Market-street car at
Third.' . . r ,
, "Guess it's so long since you've been on
acar that you don't remember to get off,"
his guide said.
"What do I want to get off for? Oh,
you can't fool me now, even if this Is my
first day on cable cars. I know how to get
to Market and Thirteenth streets Just as
well as the next man."
"Third and Townsend" is a phrase that
he never learned.
Back in the center of town and loitering
along the streets he seemed suddenly to
realize how he had been "rubbering." "I
don't want to make you ashamed of me,
because of my staring like an owl," he
said.' "So I'll keep my head down and
turn my eyes up. I'm no farmer."
His first ride in a modern elevator
threatened to be his last. A quick ride
to the height of some dozen stories made
him reel so that he was not*sure of hi3
balance' for a quarter of an hour after he
had left the "airship," as he called it.
A trip to the Chutes at night was what
made him happiest. There were no sad
associations to be recalled, but there were
endless wonders to be seen.
.He roared with laughter when the first
boat shot the chutes.
"Something broke loose." he cried as
the party slid over the water: and when
he was told that there had been no acci
dent, that this was an amusement for
amusement seekers, he only laughed
again. \
' "I don't want any of that kind of fun,"
he said, only naif-convinced.
The -lion Wallace absorbed his atten
tion for at least ten minutes. His roar
seemed =. to- startle- the mam- No wonder,
when he v has seen and heard only the
monotonous noises of the prison for these

Returning in the electric cars his won

claimed that -he' "couldn't get it through
his head how those wires, were rigged to
tow .the cars along." Having boarded it,
he got off just as it was starting in order
to look under it and see how the wheels
were "fixed." . *
As he was dragged up again to an out
side seat he heaved a long sigh. â¢
'.'I'll tell you what," he said: "I'd like
to have' fifty more years to live.^for this

FOR THIRTY YEARS1A ORA ' NA TAHITI"â that , was tha
song bur hearts were singing on the
morning, of- June 26â the hearts of
those who were going down to*Jthe
sea in the great ship Australia:,-To
be sure, most of the company .had never
heard the words nor knew their meaning,
but among us" there were some who had
been" born and bred in fair .Tahiti, and
others there wereâ it seemed from every
race and climeâ who had dwelt thete for
years,. and their intense longing for home,
their enthusiasm about their lovely island
paradise passed soon to stranger hearts
and ears, and so not many days out the
spell and fascination of this pearl of the
Pacific was upon us all; thus, It was that
the burden of our song was "la ora na
Tahiti," rand the music melted all hearts
into one. â¢â¢, â¢ . - .....;..â¢Â¦....
The Fourth. of July was passed in mid
ocean,-and you may be sure- we did not
forget -to put in prayer .and- praise and
.speech" and "patriotic, anthem the story of
our country's â¢ glory. Other places and
other- Americans may, have had more elab- |
orate celebrations, but surely none that
were entered into with more spirit, nor
brought with them a more realizing sense
of -what American ' citizenship '( with - its
blessings and duties meant. Judge Knight
of Ix>s Angeles 'entertained" and edified ua .
"Toilers of the Seal" \vith"a speech that,
e'ntirely impromptu;" was really "remarka- .,
ble.for its beauty and eloquence and yet
simple dignity. . The " afternoon was spent
on the .hurricane deck, where a pro
gramme of games, both for ladies and
gentlemen, caused much enthusiasm and
laughter. , . Â¦ â¢â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦." < ' .
And so the days went by, delightfully
and all too rapidly. Early on the Â¦
morning of July '6 we found ourselves
drifting in the harbor of Nukahiva; the
principal island of the Marquesas, waiting
for the pilot and physician, not a cloud
between us, and the heavensÂ» the faint
odor of the land stealing out to us from
the tropic island, the music of the surges
tossing on the beach. Boats were soon
wered and manned and in a short time
Â¦ were landed on the shores of lovely
./likahivaw The white coral sand shone
Â«lke bits of broken glass,, and downvto
ocean's very edge row upon row of stately
cocoa palms reared their, graceful heads
to heaven. These, interspersed with rose
wood, sandalwood, breadfruit, banyan,
mangoes, guavas and other strange- and
wondrously beautiful forms of tropic veg
etation made real a land hitherto we had
only dreameS of and seen in painted
pictures. â¢ . '.- " ' - â¢ . â¢
We had six hours on, shore, and during
that time saw something of the natives.
We also called upon the sisterhood, who
are laboriously striving to teach these
young "savages"!the ways and graces of
Christianity. .And indeed theirs is an up
hill task. If Christian faith and eractica
could be loosed from so-called Christian
civilization and from many of, its expo
aents-as found in these peaceful isles all
might be well with the missionaries and
their neophytes. Â¦ We had the honor of
dining with Monsignor Martin, the Vicar
Apostolic of the Marquesas. Truly his Is
an apostolic life, and a more kindly, gen
tle and hospitable shepherd of hls-flock
one would scarce wish to- see.- It remind
ed us of some such scene'in the life of one
of the apostles to watch this humble
Christian Bishop, In his poverty and sweet
simplicity and without one word of apol
ogy, for his slender larder. and poorly fur
nished banqueting, hall, going about and

fastened, if you please, wira a garseouj
hatpin of prismatic glass. And in some
quarters the inducing of these poor na
tives to thus clothe themselves passes for
civilization. Other women who are as
yet still near to nature's heart despisa
this headgear and crown themselves with,
garlands of frangipani and hibiscus flow
era, which here attain the dimensions of a
saucer. Their ears they entwine with
other sweet-smelling blossoms. But all
alike are addicted to tha Mother Hub
bard habitâ and it would seem irrevocably.
Boots for either sex are entirely un-^
known, for the reason that from conH
' stantly going barefooted their feet araT^
flat and exceedingly broad, and boots to 1
fit would have to be something- the siza
of their own canoes, but loss graceful In
outlineâ decidedly so.
Frequently you see a Mother Hubbard
with one or two yards - of a train and
sometimes the women carry these "court
trains" over their arms and so save wear
and tear and avoid blinding their neigh
bors with dust and poisoning them with
microbes. Fancy what a comfort these
South Sea ladles, with their thoughtful
ness concerning the ravages of the "dead
ly microbe," would be to the Oakland
Supervisor who strove to put the ban
on trailing skirts! Thus virtue is its
own reward and even Oakland waa re
membered in our wanderings in the South
Seas. Other dusky maidens there, were,
however. And they seemed to have an
utter contempt for the "microbe fad."
and one of the funniest sights under
heaven is to see them go sailing by,
bare-footed and their long trains gather
ing up the dust like a city street sweep-
Ing machine and seemingly as self-satis
fied as must have been the good Queen
of Sheba when she appeared bef ore Solo
mon, in all the glory and magnificence 0*
an up-to-date wardrobe.
Two of these native women some of us
will never forgej. Enthused with rum
and, drunk with a conviction of their own
gorgeousness, they frequently appeared
at most unexpected time3 and places,
clothed in Mother Hubbards of intens*
purple and with regulation trains. ThÂ«
sight of us seemed to make them starle
mad and immediately they would begin
to caper unsteadily to the weird move
ments of their native dance. Tha only
explanation of their "midwinter" matasii
we could offer was possibly they had
â¢' gone daft over one or other of the hand
some gentlemen of our party.
The natives, as a whole, are a â¢Impla,
kindly, gentle race â positively handsome
in many cases â with their souls, without
guile or pretense, looking at you from thÂ«
depths of coal black eyesâ eyes that would ,
give beauty and distinction to the most 1
ordinary face. But like the Marquesans. I
moral and physical disease are sapping
their fine proportion and defacing their
bodily comeliness. However, they axÂ»
still a race that artists and lovers of thÂ«
body beautiful can yet enthuse overâ
with their intensely black hair, .pearly
teeth, broad noses and copper colored
complexion and without a trace of thÂ«
conventional savage in their tenderly Â«â¢
Â¦ pressive . faces.
From what we could learn from hlglj
class half-castes and unprejudiced Euro
peans the pure native makes no pretense
of practicing sexual morality. In other
times, so we were told, it was not so.
Many Europeans resident in those Islands
have no high standard of living, and thÂ«
poor natives have caught the moral con
tagion and strive to imitate those whom
they consider their. betters. And so laxity
In the decencies of life has terribly In
creased in later years. Marriage laws are
ignored or not enforced, and many of thÂ«
natives have reduced the relationship Â¦ of
the sexes to the manners and customs OS
the poultry yard.
To sea a native reeling drunk is no ex-
The remainder of the day wÂ» spent in
walking about through the shaded by
ways and lanes of this topsy-turvy little
city. The streets are absolutely noiseless,
save now and then an occasional weird
chant coining from native throats, to
which native rum had lent enthusiasm,
for, although this was only July 9 and the
"fete" did not besin until July 14, the gla
mour and the promise of It was already in
the hearts of the natives, and, like happy
children of other climes, they were begin
ning a bit early to enjoy Its many pleas
ures and, alas, its too great freedom and
license. We notice that the natives all go
barefooted, men and women alike. Tha
men -are clothed in a long strip of thin,
cloth dyed in contrasting colors of whitÂ©
and red and blue and orange. This is
called a. "pareu,"/ and falls in graceful
folds from the waist line to the knees,
the upper â¢ and lower portions of . their
bare, bronze, shiny bodies being- nude.
Their heads, covered with a thick growth
of black hair worn short, are topped oft
with a hat of any descriptionâ in fact,
"any old thing," so long as it is a hat.
The - native women - wear the Mother
Hubbard gown, and anything more un
graceful and better calculated to hide tha
beauty of the "female form divine" was
never invented, even by missionaries. The
(female portion of .the population seem to
have caught some idea of its, utter hlde-'
ousness, and. so strive to even up things
by '.having their "glad rags," as one
American irreverently styled them, made
of .cloth more or less expensive and be
flounced and bef rilled and trimmed with
lace and ribbon. The very up-to-date

we could buy nothing until 12 o'clock

soon realized that it was sober truth.
Everybody .who was anybody had gone to

there can be no question that the lives of
men like Bishop Martin and his brethren
certainly have not been in vain. This is
the purely spiritual point of view. Unfor
tunately there is anotherâ the purely ma
terial viewâ as it affects the earthly lives
and fortunes and destinies of these gentle
South Sea Islanders, and from this merely
material point of view there comes a ter
rible Indictment of "modern Christian
civilization." It is one of the saddest,
saddest stories ever told. Thirty years ago
there were upward of forty thousand;
souls in the Marquesas group of islands.

Up to a short time ago, when it was
prohibited, the natives of both sexes made
Â¦ a practice of tattooing, and so many of
them are' still adorned in that way â the
imen generally across their faces, the wo
men on their hands. And it seems that
they do this to" beautify themselves, and
: render themselves attractive to the oppo
site sex. ( To civilized eyes, of course, it
'makes them' merely hideous â but perhaps
not more' so than do the methods of some
of our own "beauty doctors"â for surely
the standards of beauty are varied and
wondrous queer. :. . . '...."Â¦.'_.":

and only losing sight of him when his
Fetii, to whom had been given the native
name of Anapa, had sought "the seclu
sion that his cabin grants." The young
savage begged to be taken to, America,
willing to leave home and friends and be
come the slave of the Californian. He
was greatly distressed on not being taken
with us. and the last seen of him he was
swimming around the hull of the Aus

stamped on every feature.
Our next stopping place was Tautirai,
the extreme point of the island, and the
proud possessor of the temporary abode
of Stevenson during one of the novelist's
visits to Tahiti. Through dense growths
of sweetly scented flowers and foliage
plants, with oranges and bananas and
breadfruit and guavas and mangoes and
ferns of bewildering varieties and shapes
â¢and sizes lining the way and frequently
meeting overhead, on we go. Sometimes
we skirt the sea, anon our road turns in
land, affording glimpses of Edenic beauty
that fill the heart with delight and strike
one dumb for want of words to speak its
loveliness. Angels' tongues might sing
the unearthly glory of it all, mere men
can only gaze and marvel and then re
member for all time to come. Every few
hundred yards the road is crossed, by
streams of limpid, living -water, some
times swelling into turbulent rivers, and
then with a dash and a splash, midst the
shouts of our native, drivers and out
riders, and comedy of comedies â midst
real English curse words, of whose mean
ing they are completely ignorant, we
reach the other shore, sore in body, but
soothed in mind to be over without a
drenching.
Our last night out was spent in the
beautiful and characteristic dwelling of
Mr. Tati Salmon, a half-caste gentleman,
educated in the best schools of England
and France, and with the polish and hos
pitality of a prince. In his veins flows
the best blood in the island, and he is
connected with the roya^ family of Ta
hiti. Standing at his own door, under the
spreading shade of a magnificent bou
galnvillea vine, his three stalwart sons
by his side, Mr. Salmon received us with
open arms, like lost friends,- and his home
was ours. We shall remember with grat
itude and love the delightful evening
spent In Papora, the home of Mr. Salmon.
Saturday afternoon found us tired, but
speechless with admiration for every
moment of our excursion into fairyland's
groves and mountainsâ ready for the cel
ebration of Julv 14.
The fete proper was begun on Saturday
afternoon and continued until Tuesday
night. The natives from the various dis
tricts had been brought to Papeete free,
of charge on board a French gunboat.
However, as it was the season when the
vanilla flowers must be fertilized or go to
ruin some preferred to remain away. The
European population took no active part
in the programme beyond that of patrons,
acting as judges of the .various events
and distributing prizes. The tQwn was gay
with flags and bunting, and at night all
of the public buildings and many of the
private residences were brilliantly and
beautifully illuminated. The games and
bicycle races of Saturday took place on
the street La Petite Pologne, and were
very similar to events seen at home. The
wonder was, not that they were well done,
but that they should be done at all. The
idea of South Sea savages doing stunts
on a bicycle is just a bit fantastic.
The remainder of the exercises consisted
of native "hymnies," viz.. choruses of
male and female voices and native dances.
These were done by natives of the
various districts contesting one against
another for the prize. All took
place in a magnificently shaded grove
fronting the government buildings. The
natives of the various districts
were garbed in strange and savage,
ofttimes beautiful costumes, worn over
their present day attire. They marched in
and seated themselves in a semicircle on
the green sward, the women in front, the
men behind. There is no musical accom
paniment whatever, unless it be the beat
ing of rude native drums and the clap
ping of hands. They sing of the grandeur
of their mountains, of the beauty and re
pose of their valleys, of the sea in its
changing moods, of their martial prowess
and success in war and of the mad revels
of former days of utter savagery. Some
times their chant is accompanied by a
slightly swaying, graceful but character
istic movement of their sleek bodies. One
female voice leads and upon this is built
the harmony. Usually one of the men
stands before them beating time, encour
aging them by wild gesticulation and
dominating all the other voices with a
treble, shrill enough, indeed, but for all
that marvelously effective in. concerted
music. The basso voices, with their hum
hum sound, are like the 'rumbling Of a
great organ. The savage music is really
enchantingâ now soft as a bird's trill, now
it surges up in triumphant harmonies of
glory and of praise; again it falls into
plaintive unison as they bewail the loss
of their national independence, 'and then
it is-soul-pieicing and inspiring as they
denounce the perlidy of tho King who bar
tered away thtir liberties. Most curious
of all was. when they sang to native words
the music of one of Sousa's marches.
"America," "The Star-Spangled Banner"
or "Ta-ra-ra boom de aye."
The native dances as sean under govern
ment auspices are really nothing more
than calisthenlc exercises, in which are
portrayed the antics and movements of
various beasts and fowls and fishes. Dur
ing .the "cow dance" the men wore hats
made to imitate the heads of bulis, and
the dance movement was intended to por
tray the belligerency of a bull lighting his
fellows for the mastery of the herd. The
same idea was carried out in the "cock
and hen dance." in this the headgear rep
resenting the heads of the male and fe
male denizens of our domestic barnyards.
The whale dance was really ingenious and
cleverly sustained. The men and women
were seated in a triple row, provided with
,paddles, which they used as if propelling
canoes while whale hunting. One of the
men. fantastically made up to represent a
whale, was rolling and floundering on the
grass. Suddenly the. boss sailor espies
him .through his make-believe glasses.
Aided by his assistants he promptly pro
ceeds to harpoon this "prince of whales."
and after much frantic effort Mr. Fish is
done to death. The leader announces that
the carcass is to be divided between the
"crew and the French officials, the entrails
and offal falling to the Chinese, all of
which denotes that the natives under
stand the arts of flattery and ridicule.
During the fete there was one block of
street given ever to booths of -various
kinds, and at night brilliantly illuminated.
This we Americans dubbed the Midway
for want of a better name. This on every
night of the holidays was crowded . with
promenading throngs, who sang and
danced and made merry as the spirit
moved them. One of the prettiest things
seen here, was the French custom of
throwing confetti at thfe promenaders.
These confetti lire circular pieces of paper
of many colors put up m neat bags of
netting and secured with pretty ribbons.
This method of -merry-making found no
small favor with the American contingent,
to whom it was entirely new. . .
Some of our party/criticizing the dances
as tame and disappointing, were informed
tra.erdlna.ry thingâ men, â¢women and chil
dren i.-ke. They drink, so we heard, for
the sake of mere drunkenness, their fa
vorite tipple being native rum or ferment
ed orange juice; and as oranges grow
wild and sugar cane is abundant the
means of intoxication are ever at hand
and always cheap.
The second morning of our stay on shore
our party, under the care of Mr. Kennedy,
a hustling representative of American
pluck and energy and hospitality, aided
by his charming wife, a gracious and ac
complished American lady, we were
bundled into spring wagons and surreys
end began our tour clear round the island.
The trip consumed four days, and a hun
dred times as many would not exhaust its
wondrous beauty. Our first stop was made
et the lovely home of the Kennedys, about
two miles from Papeete. The house js a
two-story cottage, with spacious verandas
running around it on all sides. It is set
upon a, knoll of green, which slopes- for
sixty or seventy yards to the ocean's
shore. The lawn ie dotted with regal
palms and tropic trees. So beautiful is it
that cne of our party remarked that
heaven with its beauties would be no sur
prise to those who dwelt in this ideal
home. At the rear is an extensive sugar
plantation, amid whose waving cane we
could hear the whirring of the cotton mill
and the buzzing of the sugar factory, for
both cotton and sugar are raised on this
property.
The French Government has built a
road almos; encircling the island, the dis
tance around being something like eighty
miles. The island consists of two almost
dietinct mountains connected by a narrow
neck of land called the peninsula. It rises
by gradual terraces from the sea to the
triple peaks that crown the center. All
the way around there is a comparatively
narrow plain almost level, through whicn
close to the sea the road winds. Along this
road are situated the different native vil
lages or districts. Practically the whole
population resides In one or the other of
these districts. Each of them is presided
over by a native chief, elected by the peo
ple, and representing the French local au
thorities.
Each village has Its own meeting house
cr hall and church. A curious thing is
that one village may be entirely Catholic
and the next just as thoroughly Protes
tant. "We had taken along with us sup
plies for four days, but they proved al
most unnecessary. Everywhere we were
received with open' arms by these gentle
"savages." They gladly gave up their
homes to us. who were surprised to find
them spotlessly clean, and every night
found us occupying beds superior to many
tound in European hotels.
In every place we stopped for the night
we found native banquets awaiting us at
which we were garlanded with sweet
emelling wreaths and entertained with
"hymnies" and dances. After dinner, on
our first night cut, at Haiteaa, we w-an
dered into the village hall and found a
6emi-religious meeting going on. The na
tives were seated on the floor, the women
In front, the men back of them. A na
tive preacher, standing back of all, was
addressing them in a quiet, earnest mon
otone. It was very droll to see the con
gregation rolling cigarettes of native to
bacco and smoking them, and. as is their
custom, after two or three puffs, passing
them on for others. So you see they take
their religion, as they do all things else
in these lazy latitudes, in a free and easy
manner. Here, also, we were reminded
quaintly of StoddardÂ»'s "chumming with a
eavage." For here a young native boy
took a sudden fancy to one of the gen
tlemen of the party. He was named
Maihaa. and proceeded to adoot the
American as his "Fetii." or relation; ex
changed names with him and followed
him around the island to Papeete, and
every morning during the "feast" Maihaa
that the French officials had ordered the
dancing to be toned down, lest they be
held responsible for any breach of the
proprieties on the part of the natives. So
far," so good.
But for those who had eyes to see and
ears to hear there was no need to travel
far to witness the native dance in all its
indecency and hideous suggestion. Not
fifty feet away from the "Midway" and
under the very noses of the police, wher
ever an accordion was droning out music,
there was gathered a group of persons
and in the center a diunken man ana
woman were sweating at every pore and
dancing as if tneir very lives depended on
it, shrieking in drunken frenzy, tearing at
their already scanty raiment as if threat
ening to add the last touch of supreme
indecency by going stark naked. All this
to frantic appiause. by onlookers of every
age and both sexes, most of whom, like
the dancers, seemed to be under the sway
of the juice of the sujsrar cane. v
Tuesday afternoon came the races, and
the funniest thing of all. at least for
Caiifornians, who are so used to the best
of this "sport of kings." However, .the
resident portion of Tahiti seemed to take
it seriously, actually dressing for the oc
casion, there being one lone pony cart
decked us for a San Jose floral fete and
occupied by two elaborately dressed Euro
pean ladies. The Governor also lent dis
tinction by his presence, accompanied by
his suite. :.: - . : :...â¢Â¦
The niust distinctive : feature of. this
great "meet" io'r us Caiifornians was that
we were kept the unholy length of fifty
minutes #a waiting his Excellency's 4good
pleasure, mid, ?.hen he did arrive, with a,
motley band of outriders and attendants,
amid the booming of the brass band, it
looked for all the world like the grand
entry first act of one of our American cir
cus rings.
S'i'ueEoay night saw the end in a blase of
glory; lor there was a gorgeous Venetian
illumination of the' canoes and all the
shipping in the harbor.
Â¦â¢. Wednesday we witnessed the famous
feat of tho fire-walkers. The chief. Papa
iti, a tir.e looking old man from the island
of Raiatea. claims preternatural powers,
derived Irom the spirit of a woman who
lived here many hundred years ago, and
who at her death was turned into a
"devil.". .

10 feet long, into which had been thrown
large -stones upon a blazing fire. When
they were sufficiently heated "Papa Iti,
with much ceremony amljncantatlon ana

fantastically rigged up, . proceeded leis
urely across the heated stones, followed
by a. procession of his disciples, all bare
footed. He would allow no strangers to
do likewise, although he had guaranteed
immunity from burns. He did. however,
allow them to cross over in their boots, of
which Â¦ permission many availed them
selves. -Any native could do the trick, for
their feet are so calloused by the vol
canic rocks and coral roads over which
they are constantly threading as to have
skin as thick as any shoe leather ever
made.. All who saw agreed that there was
nothing preternatural about it; that, is
was a cleverly -worked up and ingenious
showânothing more.
Â¦ The last night ' on shore- all our' party
were entertained at a ' magnificent recep
tion and dinner, tendered us at the unique
home of our American friends, Mr. and
Mrs, Kennedy, who had spent every. day

There are some delicious secret passages
in the old Vail house connected with an
ingenious murder plot. From the time
this plot gets well under way until the
epilogue the story grips you, but the first
chapter%,-' which deal with a tame: love
affair, lack interest. Moreover, Harry
Vail, the hero, is not half the man that
is Geoffrey Langham, his friend, and. our
sympathy Is constantly thrown in,, the
wrong channel.
The Luck, together with the supersti
tion, is ' fallen heir to by young Harry
Vail, the hero of the novel. He suffers a
number of accidents, all attributable to
fire, frost or rain,' and thus the supersti
tion becomes . firmly rooted .in his mind.
Benson cleverly winds up by pointing out
that not the danger is hereditary, but the
fear of It, and thus the luck Is, indeed, an
e\'il influence for the possessor.
"The Luck" Is an heirloom in the form
of a wonderful, gem-set cup, which has
belonged for generations to the family of
Vail and-* about which clings a supersti
tion founded upon the lines engraved
around it:
â¢ "When the Luck of the Vails Is lost.
Fear not. fire nor rain nor frost:
TVhen the Luck is found again.
Fear both fire and frost and rain."
The trouble Is that the thrills begin so
late in the book. -In fact, the first chap
ters are bo unattractive, that it is to be
feared that only the paid revlewerwill
ever read far enough to reach ,the Intense
part of the narrative. In the first part of
the story the author fails of suspense,
which is the primary secret of success in
a tale that depends for, its interest upon
event. ' ' . <
E. *T\ Benson,' 'the (young ;Engl!shman
who called attention?to himself by writ
ing the smart portraiture of "Dodo," has
struck out In a new direction. In "The
Luck of the Vails", he has revived old
time romance, rutting it forth in modem
coloring, and the result is several . thrills.

Literary Notes.
Sorlbner's Magazine for August Is the
annual fiction number, and it contains
seven complete short stories, the beginning
of a new serial, and special illustrated
articles and poems. The color-printing
is shown at its best in the exquisite work
of Maxfleld Parrish. who has found a very
congenial subject in Quiller-Couch's story
of the Cornish coast, which has to do
with a classical legend. These drawings
are . the most remarkable In color which
have been yet attempted. There i3 also a
beautiful cover design by Albert Herter.
which it has taken ten printings' to repro
duce. The leading fiction Is a novelette by
Richard Harding Davis, entitled "A
Derelict," which depicts the character of
a brilliant but erratic newspaper corre
spondent, who writes the best story of the
destruction of the Spanish fleet at San
tiago. It is a thrilling narrative, and the
illustrations by Walter Appleton Clark
are the most effective yet achieved by
this artist. Another sea story by James
B. Connolly, the new writer, is filled with
that vigor of description and rapidity of
movement which distinguish all his
work. This one describes a race between
a Gloucester fishing schooner and an
Englishman's yacht from Iceland to
Gloucester. It is fully Illustrated by
'Burns, who is familiar with every detail
of the fishing fleet. A Mississippi River
story, entitled "The Memphis Packet," by
Willis Gibson, reveals a charming char
acter and an original situation; Illustrated
by F. C. Yohn. What women's clubs
meant to one woman Is- told by Octave
Thanet in "The Object of the Federation,"
a story full of humor and sentiment, illus
trated with drawings by Christy. Mrs.
Isobel Strong tells the true story of "A
Little Savage Gentleman." who was for a
time a member of Stevenson's household.
J. A. Mitchell, the author of "Amos
Judd." begins a short serial to run through
the fall months, entitled "The Pines of
Lory." This Is in the author's romantic
and whimsical vein, and Is a sort of up
to-date "Paul and Virginia." the scene
being a promontory In the St. Lawrence)
River. "Zack," the popular young Eng
lish writer, contributes a humorous story
of Devonshire, entitled "Benjamin Par
rot's Fancy." Jesse Lynch Williams. who>
has written for Scrlbner"s a number of
articles about aspects of New York City,
describes "Rural New Tork City." show-
Ing how one may go shooting and fishing,
see Chinese farmers at work, visit a
typical country store and get lost In the
woods, all within the city limits. The
illustrations for these unusual places are
by such artists as Child. Glackens. Shinn.
and McCarter. An elaborate Breton poem
by Florence Wilkinson is illustrated by
Henry McCarter.

The American Book Company of New
Tork has Just placed on the market some
thing In the way of an arithmetic. Tt Is
called "Winslow's Natural Arithmetic." by
Isaac O. "YVinslow. M.. A., principal of the
Thayer-street Grammar School. Provi
dence, R. I., and is In three voIuit^s. The
purposes of this series, as set forth by the
author, are: 1â To present the subjects in
a spiral order, treating together the easier
principles of the various topics and re
serving the more difficult until the child
has gained the power to comprehend them
easily. 2 â To make the work easy, the
pupil being kept busy with a varied appli
cation of the principles already mastered.
Instead of being too rapMly crowded for
ward into greater difficulties. 3â To give
the subject variety and interest by basing
the problems upon facts and principles
gathered from the different studies, and
thus correlating arithmetic with the other
branches, while adding distinctly to its
vividness and attractiveness. 4â To de
velop genuine mathematical thought by
promoting originality in + he pupil's work
and by developing fully each new princi
ple before it Is put into practice. 5â ; To
give prominence to the idea of magnitude,
recognizing the psychological fact that all
mathematical knowledge is a system of
relations, or ratios. (Price, Book I 30
cents. Book II 40 cents. Book III 50 cent3.)

Perhaps the most serious and scholarly

subject and his words are entitled to carry
weight. . One point of Latin failure as con
trasted with Anglo-Saxon success Is prob
ably as JMr. Bigelow says: "Spain has
solved much of her negro question by in
termarriage with Africans. The French-

The Portuguese, too. seem to have been
unfortunate in their ideas of colonial gov
ernment. In this connection the author
gives.some interesting examples of affairs
at Delagoa Bay. He says that this port
is naturally situated to the best advan
tage, but through the lack of sanitary
measures it is little better than a pest
hole; and further, that the customs regu
lations are such as to frighten away all
commercial enterprise. On the other hand,
the port of Durban, which was once look
ed upon very unfavorably, is now actually
regarded as a health resortâ this under
British rule.
There is much hard sense in all that
Mr. Bigelow has to say, and I regret that
man colony of Kiaochau are not without
their lesson. He found on his first visit
about 1500 soldiers or officials as against
five merchants and the Governor In a
frame of mind that could not Understand
why these merchants would persist in
bothering him with questions about the

who had seized the place twelve months be-
climate: Spain has looked upon her out
side possessions simply in the light of
slaves to the mother country. \
In his first chapters Mr. Bigelow draws
a strong and vivid picture of these Span
ish Iniquities. The slaying of the mild
mannered natives through the pretext of
false religious belief that they might be
despoiled of their possessions, the enslave
ment of the miserable savages who were
not killedâ all this was done without the
raising of a single voice,' with the excep
tion of the Jesuits, who were learned in
government and foresaw the ultimate ruin
that must necessarily follow the exter
mination of a race where no more could
be sent to fill their places. For Spain was
not a country of vast population nor great
manufactures seeking an outlet.
It is curious, but with all Spain's ha
tred for the Anglo-Saxon her only com
mercial prosperity has been through
these enemies with whom she has been
almost continuously at war. At no, time
In her history has she been able to hold
her island possessions free from depreda
tion, while England on the other hand has
ever been attracted by colonies surround
ed by the sea.
The Germans as colonists seem to have
had their best success under the flag of
some other country. Their own flag, ac
cording to Bigelow, has brought too much
officialism and red tape for the best ad
vantage.
A German official who had been . stationed in
Africa once described to me the panic. created
amons his colleagues when regulations and
forms were received from Berlin calling for de^.
tailed information regarding the native capac
ity for taxation. Column arter column was to
be filled in with certificates of birth, charac
ter of occupation, nature of dwelling and the
many sources of income known to a Prussian
policeman. The panic In tlje Government Bu
/roau was as nothlne. to the blank amazement
\of a native Kaffir, whose worldly inventory
comprises a war club and a hut of reeds.
The Germans themselves realize all this,
judging from a conversation that Mr.
Bigelow had with one of them:
A wealthy German planter who had lar*e
plantations in Sumatra got oft at SlnpaporÂ».
I took him one day frreatly to task for not
assisting in the development of German East
Africa instead of brinplng his capital and in
telligence to the advancement of a rival col
ony. Said my German friend:
"I did try to settle in German East Africa
but I was not made welcome. I was chokea
by red tape. I was not reearded as an In
telllBent member of the community, but as one
to be ordered about by officialsâ as though I
were a peasant recruit.
"So! It is impossible yet to drf anything In
Â« German colonyâ there IsÂ» too much Kovern
irent. Instead of getting the best man ar.1
paying him a high salary, they pay a dozen
men shabbily and get hut the common run of
officials, end you can't ask for anything worse
thnn that, at least In the- tropics. Why, thÂ»
German Government does not pay the Gov
ernor of a colony as much as I pay an over
seer! My manager would not change places
with the Governor of East Africa!"
The author's observations In the Ger-
POULTN'ET BIGELOW as a writer
on colonization possesses the double
merit of being a student and a
traveler. His latest book, "The
Children of the Nationsâ a Study of
Colonization and Its Problems." is re
markable in two ways: first, for the care
with which its author has culled from the
authorities on the subject, and second, for
what he has seen with his own eyes and
having seen has derived therefrom a les
son.
Mr. E'.gelow writes his history of early
colonization from the fifteenth century in
plain, straightforward and purposeful
style. Considering tha possible length of
such a* treatise, he puts the matter in a
rutshell. Of colonizing at the present
time he has much to say from his own
personal observations and experience.
Nothing Is given that does not in some
- Â¦ -v present an object lesson of value.
This book Is very apropos of both time
and event. As we are a nation governed
by the people It is right that the people
should further inform itself "before it tries
to extend its jurisdiction to others than
itself. In his preface Mr. Bigelow even
advocates the establishment of a colonial
schooL He says:
It Is our hope that earnest people may ulti
mately Induce Congress to establlfh a na
tional university for the study of subjects in
which Â» colonial official should be proficient.
VÂ» need a. species of Colonial Â¦ West Point: we
owe It - to our fellowmen. .whether they be
Fpanish or Tacalog, Chinese or Malay. Papist
cr pagan. East or WÂ«*t Indian, that we Rive
them a jrovernment based on business princi
ples.
After reading all that Mr. BiKelow has
to say from careful research and years of
practical study in the matter, the serious
ness of colonization cannot fall to be ap
preciated by any one who follows him in
his outline of colonial development.
His study begins at the earliest time
when the Pcpe Alexander VI, dividing the
world into two parts of East and 'West,
gave one to Spain ard the other to Po.rtu
gal. This was in 14L J 3 â one year after Co
lumbus had discovered America to estab
lish a slave trade and begin the long years
of conquest and plundering that seem ever
to have followed Spanish rule. Spain's
example has given to the world some
splendid rules for what not to do.
Her con<juest of the Western world was
achieved within the lifetime of A single man.
but no sooner had her power been effectively
asserted than she . commenced to govern in a
manner which makes us marvel, not so much
at the quantities of colonies Fhe has lost, but
lit the fact tliat there remained In 1898 any
for her to lose. Â¦Â¦â¢ -' â¢ '.
Flavery, love of plunder and a Fhort-
Ffchted policy of looking only at the ben
efits of to-day and not at those of to
morroTi' seem to have been the cause of
Spanish failure. Treachery and misrule
have followed close in the wake of the
Spanish flag abroad- The comparison be
tween the Knglish as colonizers on the one
hand and the Spanish on the other affords
a pplendld lesson. It Is one that we^as
Anglo-Saxons can appreciate. Looking* at
results alone here is an example:
Clive entered India as a seourjte; he left It
amid the tears of jrrateful natives.
The Spaniard entered Mexico as a guest; he
remained es a ecouree, and he left it after
three centuries of misrule amid the curses of
an outraged people.
Spain has worked her colony schemes
on the principle of killing at once the
goose that laid the golden eggs, lest some
one else might get a few. England has
simply fed the goose and kept a close eye
out for the eggsâ that Is all. England has
always made a study of her colonies and
has tried to adapt the Government to the
requirements of the people, conditions and
man In Martinique and Guadelupe. has
also produced a bountiful bastard breed.
The Anglo-Saxon and the Boer" of South
Africa are the only peoples that have kept
their blood untaintedâ and this is one se
cret of their power over native races." .
He thinks that the ability of, the Fili
pino is, as a general rule, underestimated
In America, for he says:
"The FVIplno. of all the natives of the
Far East, has a character which endears
him to me. He has In his blopd a'sugges
tion of the chivalrous Japanese, . the dig
nity and of the unspoiled
Spaniard, the ferocity of the Malay and
the secretlveness of the Chinaman. In
America we have been pleased to carica
ture him as' a man half nepro, half
monkey. That is far from the .truth.
Filipinos are highly Intelligent creatures,
and our fault has been to suppose that
we can rule 6uch people by force alone.
Other nations have failed at -this, game,
and it is for us to profit by their, ex
ample."
Two sections of the book are deserving
of especial mention, for they deal with
subjects materially affecting our own
colonial aspirations. These are, "The
Negro as an Element in Colonial Ex
pansion" and "The Chinaman as. a Colon
ist." Volumes upon volumes could be
written upon these problems alone, but as
far as he goes Mr. Bigelow Is complete In
his analysis and apparently fair. He de
cides that the Chinaman makes the beat
colonist that the world has to offer,, for
he Is Industrious, can stand any climate
and hard work, and always lives to his
agreements. He thinks that one serious
mistake. made by Americans is a popular
tendency to consider Inferior races the
equals of the Caucasian. He asserts that
the negro in the capacity of a soldier or
n servant Is loyal." stanch and useful,
and that he needs the restraining and
governing hand of the superior mind.
From Herodotus to Uncle Remus, we find
the same helpless darkles, the delight of chil

rection to remind him that, authority is lodged
In superior intelligence.
In his closing chapters Mr. Blsrelow does
not hesitate to express his. mind freely on
our own requirements at the present pe
riod. He writes:
At this moment we are repeating, in Cuba
ar"i the Philippines the same political faults
which havÂ« made Spanish administration a by
woni throughout the world. Pur first task
should he. therefore, to reorganize our own ad
ministration on a business basis, so that In

connection with this work is one that was

acters and with his wifeâ an Americanâ
as the heroine. Is now runnlnsr serially in
the Cosmopolitan Magazine, and will b-Â»
published In book form in the autumn.
Mr. Castle writes to his publishers that
the story has be*n dramatized most sur r
cessfully in Grrat Britain, and that it*
Euccess on the stag:- there has been very
remarkable. The Kendala will probably
rresent the play In thia country later on.
The publication of "The Secret Orchard"
In book form is likely to be one, of th*
most notable events In the world of fic
tion during the autumn of 1901. The pub
l'shers are using their best efforts to make
the dress of the volume worthy of Its con
tents and are preparing a very large first
edition.
The author is. a resident of New Tork
City and an enthusiastic student of New
Tork history. Her earlier book, ."Will
Shakespeare's Little Lad." was also care
fully historical. (Published by Charles
Scflbner's Sons, New York. â¢ Price $1 50.)
The title la taken from Browning's. line,
"God's puppets, best and worst, are we,"
and indicates the widely divergent types
in , the story. The fashionable English,
the simple and devout Dutch, are far
apart, with a great gulf fixed between
them. The skill of the novelist â¢ has
bridged th'is gulf.
Many of its pictures are exquisitely col
ored, such as that of the Domlne's home
and his old garden with the little back
gate, where the gay young officer .paid
many a visit to the Dutch girl; Jan, the
old gardener, Is a good study, and Larry,
the excitable. Impetuous and irresolute
brother of Peggy, is true to life. The' char
acter sketches all have merit in a some
what superficial way.
The story deals with soldiers, but not
with war. Its time, is prerevolutlonary.
It finds itself," however, in the outskirts
of the "Washington atmosphere" and
ought to satisfy the popular demand for
that same climate.
This Is Peggy, a belle among the Eng
lish and nominally the heroine of the
story. She is a dashing, independent
young lady, with a deal of spirit and
agreeable wit. One of the principal event3
of the tale is her riding and winning a
race in the guise of a jockey when her
financially embarrassed brother could find
no one else whom he could trust to ride
and so win the much-needed cash. The
young lady's escapade leads to many com
plications through her own and her
friends' efforts to keep it secret and its
inevitable discovery.
"God's Puppets," by Miss Imogen Clark,
is a pleasant story, full of charming his
torical coloring. It deals with the old
Dutch "element In New York, twÂ» of the
principal characters. being, a Dominie of
the Dutch church and his daughter An
netje.- The portrait of the girl is clearly
drawn and appears to be the favorite of
the author. She is gentle, clinging, duti
ful, affectionate. She is sharply contrast
ed with the other girl of the story.

tual and physical nature, it imparts
the power of self -discipline, thus en
abling one to confer the greatest
iavor and to be of the greatest possi
ble service to not only themselves,
but to all with whom they are asso

individual unconsciously uplifts all
with whom he or 6he is thrown in
contact. The higher education, in the
finest and best sense of the. word,
means culture of the heart as well as
of the mind, and the best result of
learning is to illustrate it by reliev
ing the indigent, teaching the ieno
*Â«oit, bringing joy to the sad.
*? T has been quoted that "education
may modify but never overrule in
11 herited defects. All nature, includ
ing human, nature, is governed by
immutable laws," but my experience
from thirty years' observation has
been, with both man and woman,
that the wider the knowledge and
the more liberal the education the
more is the usefulness and the happi
ness of the individual promoted. It
is but the natural consequence of'sys
tematic training of the mind that the
mind so brought into action will be
clearer in perception, more accurate
Â£n judgment and enjoy a more thoi
ough understanding of the majesty
/ and beauty of the law and order and
design. A development of the facial
ties through mental activity cannot
"hut promote to the success of any oc
cupation or profession in any walk of
life. To thefliigher education of wo
man the same rule will apply. If she
is to bs a wife and mother, the moie
thorough her training 1 the better will
the fce enabled to train her child; the
nore comprehensive her understand
ing, the better will she be fitted to
advise her husband, and for the gen
eral good of the nation this type of
woman is most essential. I consider
it highly important that our girls
nhould fca cflnvcrsant-with one or two
of the less obvious branches of sci
ence, and especially those studies
which will enable them to better ur.
derstand the operation of the human
mind. Physical health depends great
ly upon the exercised knowledge oC
hygiene, an elementary knowledge of
therapeutics is essentially beneficial.
rJso natural philosophy is important;
for Low many erroneous and con
tracted views are given to the most
simple causes of natural phenomena.
Education attunes the mind, it opens
the way to a better appreciation of
fc;2usic and literature, it promotes to
gT education I understand the devel
opment of the faculties of the body,
heart'; and mind â physical, moral
and mental. The highest education
of an individual consists In the
harmonious training of hla faculties
to that degree which enables him
to perform with the- greatest effi
ciency those functions, and to dis
charge those duties which In his spherÂ»
of activity confront him. Tou ask.
Can there be an excess of true educa
tion? In the sense in which I understand
the term, obviously not; for, strive how
ever we may. perfection must ever eluda
our efforts. And this Is as true of. edu
cation as of all other human pursuits.
Education, however, must not , be con
founded with mere learningâ especially
book learning. To illustrate: A man
might be able to explain most lucidly the
varying degrees of efSciency of all known
detonants, the mathematical curves de
scribed by a bullet as it leaves the muz
zle' of the rifle, and the history of fire
arms from the days of the Invention of
gunpowder to the present: and yet, for

slopes of Tampalals, the barefootad

Roger Bacon, and for his life could not
tell the difference between a parabolic
and a hyperbolic curve would be better
educated, better trained, than he. You
may, if you wish, readily apply these no
tions to the education of women. Before
you can determine what is the proper edu
cationâthe proper trainingâ of a woman,
you must first know what she is destined

meant to him. Not the importing
of dry facts and arbitrary doc
trines; these would never be edu
cation; but the leading forth of a
mind, the cultivation of its growth.
This is why he was an educator
in the true sense of the word. He
led forth tlwse under his guidance;
led them from the darkness of
ignorance into the light of greater
understanding. Nor did lie ever
fail to live up to the principle which
he laid down here: "The higher
education, in the finest sense of the
word, means culture of the heart as
well as of the mind."

THE LAST WRITING PROFESSOR
JOSEPH LE CONTE GAVE
TO PUBLICATION.
1 CERTAINLY approve of the same
. educational opportunities for our girls
as for our boys. If a woman were to
do the best for herself in a worldly
sense there is no better way than by
' fitting herself to confer the largest bene
fits to those around her. It Is a foolish
theory that learning makes a woman a
bore and destroys the pleasure of so
ciety. I should rather say the lack of
learning makes such conditions. Men
looking for agreeable companions look
among the educated. The development
of the faculties gives additional grace and
luster to their attractions. I should say
a college education does not unfit a
woman for domestic duties; It adds rather
to -a. more- perfect ~ accomplishment ., of
them. A knowledge of Greek or Latin
may not assist in the concocting of a
dainty dessert, but it will not detract
1 from H3 perfection.
Early Impressions are not easily ef
faced; if the mother is able to give . in
telligent answers to the child's query, will
not that child bo more fully developed?
If she understands music, will it not add
to the pleasure of her home? Perhaps
she has learned French; a knowledge of
the language of any contemporary nation
cannot be harmful. But a most thorough
education consists in ; giving our girls
mental . equilibrium regardless of the
learningâ the rest will depend upon tha
Individual. '
fT^HERE is a misconception of the
I term education from my point of
1 view. One may have a mind well
I stored with the wisdom of the an-
X cients. be able to perform with ac
curacy a mathematical problem, or glibly
quote pages of the Iliad, yet should their
Inner heart be the abode of vanity and
prejudice they cannot be accredited with
a true education. I share the view given
In Sydney Smith's Theorem: "The woman
who has successfully cultivated her mind
without diminishing the gentleness and
propriety of her nature Is always sure to
meet with respect and attention, border
ing upon enthusiasm." Certainly the edu
cational doors should be open to man and
woman alike, for in many instances that
which nature r-ns neglected education will
develop. Through the pursuit of the va
rious branches the intellect is broadened
the brain is made necessarily more active'
new currents of thought are entered Into
the memory is trained to receive and re
tain and the mental arguments uncon-*
eclou6ly taken up develops the reasoning
faculties. The higher education ia also
conducive to prudence and a closer dis
crimination In all thing*. Including matri
mony. The process of having'clear and
r y\ COLLEGE education certainly
f [ does not unfit a woman for do-
I I mestic duties, for anything which
VÂ» I tends to develop the faculties can-
JL not but be for the betterment of
the individual and all with whom she is
thrown in contact. Let it not be said that
the higher education will take woman
from her home; precisely the contrary
must be the effect Should those who de
nounce the higher education for women
be remanded tiÂ» homes where women were
taught only to be proficient in sewing,
cooking and the nursing of babies they
would Boon cry out for a home with a
woman of the period. Sweet simplicity is
beautiful, like a beautiful picture, but
beautiful pictures do Â¦ not make compan
ionable wives, and Ignorant motherhood
is a crime against nature.
At a. rseeting of the collegiate alumnae,
a.n organization consisting of representa
tives from eighteen different Institutions
for the higher education of women, an ac
tion was taken which resulted In the
renovating of the entire system of plumb-
Ing existing at that time in the city of
Boston. So much for the hygienic knowl
edge of the college women.
At the same meeting a statistical re
port concerning marriage was read. A
large percentage of non-college women
enter into matrimony under the age of
Â£4 years, a corresponding percentage of
college women marry at the ape of 26
years or over, thus proving that the high
er education tends to a closer discrimina
tion in selecting a life partner. Concern-
Ing divorces, it was found that there are
fewer divorces and less domestic infelicity
where the wives are college women, also
that there is a less mortality among tho
children. An applied knowledge of hy
giene certainly adds to physical health
A knowledge of the laws of chemistry

end In the direction of her household. As
tronomy, geology or the classics may not
have a direct influence upon the home,
but they are certaisjy beneficial if never
used, for they broaden the mental vision
and strengthen the Intellect. Our great
statesmen, our lawyers, our doctors did
not study the classics because they
wished to read them now. they do not use
their knowledge of these branches in their
every day activities, but In' the pursuit of
tl^cse studies they have developed Into
great rr.en. as the higher education will
de\elop our girls into great women, good
wives and noble mothers. Education im
perta the power to minister to the higher
v/ants of those nearest. When a woman
Is thus fully equipped she can be truly
called an angel in tfce home.
TO make a nation truly great we
must have great women, and the
broadening of the intellect through
education, theoretical and practical,
can make such. It is not necessar
ily the college woman, but the woman
who knows how to make her home the
center of, intellectual and kindly Inter
course, the artist, the woman of letters,
the philanthropist who stands forward as
our ideal mother and w^fe. A woman can
not have too much education. The edu
cation which arms one tor every point
should comprehend a training for all
parts of life equally, for hours of relaxa
tion, as well as hours of active occupa
tion. . We are told how frequently a hus

is not interested in the life that Interest?
him. Lack of interest is often Ignorance
of the subject In hand. I most heartily
approve of college education or any edu
cation which will broaden the intellcc'
and promote the general good of the na
tion, for its future depends upon what
the mothers of the period make it.

<-T * ISTORY has been written about
I A court circles of our republic deal-
F 1 Ing with our finest grained and
J noblest women from Marth*
Washington to Ida 'McKinley.
Among them figure all women who have
attained a prominence as beauties, wits
or "grand ladyes." Each one of these
women was educated for the express pur
pose of presiding over the home of somÂ»
man, becoming the mother of children
who were expected to be "wise and brave
as their fathers and as virtuous as their
mothers."
These women accomplished all thetr du
ties without the "higher education." They
â¢were taught to write elegant letters: they
wore lovely gowns: had the whitest
hands ever seen; their children were- obe
dient and deferential: they are the wo
men whose faces will be glorified and
whose names will be the theme of the
"belles' letters" of the world while it
rolls around In Its space. The education
of my day was & little more advanced, but
I was also trained to believe that to ba
the companion of some manlike man, to
be mother and trainer of hi3 children,
was the chief duty of woman: but even
then the continuous straining of thÂ»
mind, the concert pitch upon the line of
crowding studies and multifold accom
plishments which we attained Injured us
In a degree, and the present higher col
lege education of girls Is undoubtedly In
jurious to them. Some of our finest medi
cal men have sounded the note of warn
ing. Schiller says, "To be man's tender
mate was worrtan born, and In obeying
nature she best serves the purpose of
heaven." The college-bred woman does
not make a good mother. It is not the
modern woman of the higher education
that the boy away from home will think
of as of one whose brooding tenderness
encompasses his very soul with love. The
best qualities of woman are Injured, or
at least latent, while her brain Is bein*
drawn out fine. It is the woman of the
fireside, the mother who talks to her Cre
ator and pleads with him for her child
that remains a picture like that of the
Madonna In the mind of every man -with
one pure spot left In his soul. In this
brief space I could not fully reply to the
question proposed, but I am for various
reasons relating to health, both mental
and physical, and for the good of the
coming race for whom we ought to live
opposed to the extreme higher education
now eiven to our girls. ...
' A woman who can write a good letter,
either business or social; who can keep
accounts so aa to stay within the limit 3
of her own or her husband's income: she
who has read , the great prose and poetic
literature of the world and its history; a
woman who knows how to keep her home
so that It will be a delight to the eye and
herself also â In fact, the "creature not too
high nor good for human nature's daily
food," Is my ideal.
My young daughter will not have a col
lege or "higher education." I shall Illus
trate my belief. No woman who ever
won the highest prize in mathematics
ever enchanted a man any more than the
Colossus of Rhodes does, and I do not
wish the days of enchantment to fade
entirely out of sight. Future generations
will pay the penalty of a manlike educa
tion of the girl of to-day. I am utterly
opposed to it, and am not alone, for thou
sands of men and women who are lead
ing the world are with me.
ICZ^OE, years and years it has been
wrangled over, this question of
"woman's education. Perhaps
this century will solve it.
Ever since the first woman with
an inquiring mind determined to
know things the fight has been or.
Goodness only knows who sbe was.
She may be recent, but it is more
likely that she dates back a long,
long way. She may have poked her
rose out of an early American wig
wam or a Grecian house, or a cliff
dwelling, for the matter of that. In
any oase, she vowed that her sole
duty was not to the cradle and the
cook stove, and she demanded a peep
into the world beyond her home.
But in these years it is not a lone,
bold woman here and there -who
pokes her nose out â it is an army
which cries out right lustily for edu
cation. The "higher educated" wo
man is among us, and we must decide
whether or not she is to have our ap
proval.
v The opinions on this page may give
a hint of what sort of an outlook she
has among representative San Fran
ciscans at the beginning: of this new
century.
DOES A COLLEGE
EDUCATION UNFIT A
WOMAN FOR
DOMESTIC LIFE?
J-WHE fear Is expressed that the col
â¢ I lege woman as the result of her col
1 lege experience will lose her worn-
I anly charm, her chance of ' matri-
JL mony, her possibility of mother
hood and her taste for domestio
life, but statistics do not confirm
this theory. Fifty per cent of the college
graduates are happy wives and mothers.
The task of motherhood is one of the
most complex and exacting known, for It
requires Â¦ all the various talents and the
most thorough knowledge." and the pecu
liar fitness for this of the woman of high
er education must not be overlooked. The
college woman has learned too much of
the Intricacies of the human body and the
human mind to neglect her child. She
studies her offspring, the result being
children mentally and physically stronger
than are shown in the best of the com
munity. * Her T/ell informed mind Is a
never falling source of amusement and
Instruction. She controls her children not
by force, but by superior knowledge,
which always commands attention and
respect. On the other hand. Ignorance
sometimes breeds contempt even of one
who might be loved otherwise.

they are catching fish at the plant of
11 the St. Anthony Falls Water Power
Company. This, too, in face of a large
eign on which is inscribed in plain letters:
"Ko Fishing Allowed; Keep Off." But,
then, only the immediate attaches of the
power-house are privileged.
Th<Â» flectricians have become so used to
working wonders by electricityâ such a
miracle, for instance, as running the
street railways of two cities without
scarcely having to turn a hand them
selvesâthat they are in the habit of call
ing the mysterious fluid to their assist
ance whenever It Is convenient to bfo-so. .
They started,' out early in Â£he season,
which did not open until Wednesday, to
fish in the legitimate way. but, falling to
get any fish to speak of by hook, they de
termined to catch them, if possible, by
crookâ to electrocute them.
Since then fish have responded with

who accounted It a more creditable per

patient, painstaking, philosophic en
reavor than to slaughter the finny tribe
on the wholesale plan in . short order.
At the power-house they take a good
live wire, properly Insulated, where' the
angler holds it, and stick the same into

Perch, shiners, bullheads, crappies and
an occasional sturgeon are caught in this
way. One of the electricians who was di

caught a sturgeon early in- the spring
which weighed twenty pounds. He said
that an ordinary current of Â¦ electricity
was strong enough to bring the most ob

the. most dogged persistence that en
abled us to hold on while Butler's guns

only. to go growling down again in defeat
a little later. We had our compensations
also. Our victorious sorties flUed to vrtfh
enthusiasm and hope, *and but for these
we should have sunk Into the very grave
of despair. . s
When this war is over (and In spite ot
all the croaklnss of the dismal it cannot
be very long before the organized brigand
age Is broken up), I hopÂ© to return to
South Africa and to enjoy some of the
opportunities for wealth which will then,
be open to all comers; and I can tell the
men of my race that they need not hesi
tate to try their luck. from any fear of
their treatment at' the hands of the Brit
ish colonists of South Africa.
Under ; these circumstances there could
be ho doubt .where my sympathies as a
colored man should lie. I pushed on south'
and Port Elizabeth just as the
storm was about to\ break.' On the first
threat of hostilities the refugees from
Johannesburg and other places In the
Transvaal ors.ihized ' themselves' into a
body of light cavalry under; the name of
the Imperial Light Horse. . To' this body I
attached myself .V I thought that my color
and my knowledge of the native dialects
might render me -useful, and, as a matter.
I had become worn out with the contin
ual labor and anxiety of bush life, and I
made my way slowly back to the more
settled districts. All the way back I heard
frequent rumors i of war impending -be-*
t ween the \ Boers and the English. This ;
.did not surprise me, as I knew' that the.
conflict was inevitable. Any one who lived
for any length, of time in South Africa
must have been convinced that the fight
had to come. \ The Jameson raid had done
av/ay. with any chance of a peaceful solu
tion of the difficulty. Feeling ran very
high, and the Boers, particularly those in
the remote '.districts, boasted repeatedly
that the time had now come for 'them to
take possession of the whole of South Af
rica. The natives were British to a man,
and some of the more powerful tribes
were Itching to get a blow, at their hered
itary oppressors. The sufferings of the
Swazis, whose lands had been ceded to the
Boers as ; a par t ; of ; the Transvaal Vepub
llc.had been told everywhere in the na
tive kraals. Those Swazis had been robbed
of their cattle' and had been made practi
cal slaves 'by the Boers upon the acquisi
tion of, the territory by them. Every;na
tive feared j his fate If the Boers should
make themselves master of the country. â¢
The imitative qualities of the natives
are frequently of great advantage to
them. Dinizulu, the son of Cetewayo, the
great Zulu warrior, Is a notable example
of this. This chief was sent by the En,
glish to St. Helena on the breakup of his
father's power. He remained oh that
island some ten years arid then was al
lowed by the British to return and re
sume authority in his tribe. It is easy to
see that Dinizulu had the natural instinct
to follow the example of thebest social
class in which he found himself. His
bearing is that, of a British officer, quiet,
dignified, unostentatious and with a touch
of hauteur. To see him on horseback rid
ing in his district, his drees and the very
poise of his body bespeak the aristocrat.
work with an Intensity and power of mas
tery that is really wonderful. The boys
that are sent by the missionaries, into the
English districts to pursue their educa
tion come back well informed and com
pare very favorably with the missionaries
themselves. It must be confessed, how
ever, that the latter are by no means the
best specimens of the white clergy. It ap
pears to be unfortunately true that only
the intellectually and socially deficient
are employed in the mission field. The .
native African brought up in his village
community is frequently very much more
of a natural gentleman than the son of
the small storekeeper, who, being too
lazy for physical toil, and not having the
intellectual equipment for home service,
has been sent out to work among natives
of remote lands.
There were two things which struck me
more forclby than anything else about
the colored aborigines of the. African con
.tlnent. In the, first place their great phy
sical vigor, and. in the second place their
wonderful adaptability. They have a cap
ital of health to draw upon. They know
nothing of the nerve wear of the present
day and they can apply themselves to
I had been hunting, and after bringing
my game down went to recover It. As I
raised my eyes from the quarry I saw
several native heads peep cautiously over
a bit of rising ground. Three rifles were
pointed at me and I was commanded in a
language of which I was ignorant to walk
ahead of the men, who thus conducted me
to their native village. Here a court was
formed and .1 was brought before -the
head man and his advisers for trial. All
through the proceedings a woman kept
shrieking something, the burden of which
I could not grasp. At last her ravings
grew bo wild and her behavior so unre
strained that I asked of a native who had
interpreted for me Into one of the Cape
dialects if the woman were really mad.
This amused the interpreter immensely
and he repeated the question to the
court. It seems that the woman had been
clamoring to have me put to death as a
Cape spy, and my ignorance of the lan
guage, as. evidenced by my question,
proved to be my salvation, for the court,
being convinced of my Inability to under
stand the language of their people, or
dered my release and I suffered no further
molestation from them. â¢â¢..-.
This Idea that I was a native boy from
the CapeÂ» engaged In spying, nearly
proved my undoing on one \
that I was a Cape boy In the service of
the Cape Government passed away they
offered me every hospitality and kind con
sideration. .
The war over, the service of the Rho
desia Company offered no further attrac
tions, and my American Independence be
gan to assert itself. I bought a sufficient
quantity of material and started on a
trading expedition into the Interior of
Africa. "With a native boy and a few ani
mals I made my way Into the most re
mote and least Inviting sections of that
part of the country. Large patches of
solitary and uninhabited land gave place
at times to prosperous villages and smil
ing and well tilled patches of cultivated
ground. The natives were all more or less
well disposed, and as soon as the. fear
It cannot be said that the Matabeles
were ever really defeated. A compromise
more or less satisfactory to both parties
was attained and the Matabeles were al
most unconsciously to themselves trans
formed from fighting men to a new ele
ment in that mighty composite, the Brit
ish empire. In a short time the Queen
became to them an object of respectful
veneration and a wild African tribe had
fairly embarked upon the path which
leads to self-government and political in
fluence.
The treatment finally grew unbearable*
so I left the Rand behind and started for
Maf eking. Over the long, dreary- stretch
of country I tramped and suffered many
hardships. At Ma f eking I found Colonel
Plumer's column about to go to take part
In the Matabele war. I joined it and for
months engaged in the wild frontier fight
ing of that campaign. The Matabeles are
a fine fighting people. Their physique is
splendid. They can endure fatigue which
would tax the energies of our best trained
men to the very limit. \
ceedingly galling, and expostulation was
frequently made* which, however v only
brought the retort that men of our color
could expect nothing better*
FOR a colored man to be under the
command of General White seems
to be a contradiction in Itself, but
such is but a very slight instance
of the contrasts and variations
Â¦which have made themselves mani
fest In ray life.

thought of the prognostications.
From Ma-ui to Australia -was my next
move. Here I mined for gold and met
â¢with several minor successes until in the
pursuit of the yellow metal I finally found
myself In Cape Town. Gold had Just been
<iiscovered in paying quantities and the
Rand -was beginning to be talked about.
That Rand, which was to be the scene

The thing has been hammered over,
time and again In the East. Here on
our coast It was for a young attorney

ily. Bald Prosecuting Attorney A. P.
' Leach of Oakland, better known as Abe:
"If I had my way, the whipping post
' should be used with all the public dis

' vice Involves upon such men as this who
beat frail little women, particularly their
: Â¦wives."
It was Jean Latrtlle that he was talk-
Ing about. Jean keeps a French laundry,
a dog and a wife, and they are all his.
He considers it his privilege to do with
them as he pleases, and it is no concern
of the court If he shower upon one of
them delicate little attentions with po
tato masher or stove lid.
Mr. Leach â¢was extremely war in when
he eald It He has been Prosecuting At
torney in that Oakland court for three
years, and in that time he has bad some
thing like twenty-five wife-beating cases.
Of these he has 6een all but some half
dozen dismissed.
"It makes me mad," he said.
"When I saw him it was several days
after and he was entirely cool, but his
view6 had not changed In the least. Â¦ "It
makes me so mad," he repeated, "not to
be able to do anything with those great
husky brutes that take clubs and pokers
to little hundred-pound women."
The trouble, he r says, all ariaes from
the old law by which wives cannot be
compelled to testify against their hus
bands.

"A wife rushes into court, crying out
for protection against a brutal husband.

Mr. Leach Is a rattling good talker and
not an amateur actor for nothing. I had
been bo absorbed In watching how they
"rolled their eyes" and "puckered their
mouths" that I had to remind myself that .
I didn't know yet how the whipping post"
Â¦was going to correct all this.
It seems that the arguments run this
way: If Imprisonment is the penalty for
wife-beating, the wife cools before she
eends her husband Into comfortable Jail
quarters while ehe has to work to sup
port the family. If a big fine is the pen
alty she is too good an economist upon

In the same way that a certain French
man waa In favor of abolishing capital

During the colonial and .revolutionary
peric-ia whipping posts flourished like
green bay trees. They were to be seen In
the market places of county capitals. In
1S40, the famous reform year, many of thÂ»
States individually abolished whipping,
and the United States "rid Its statute
books of the matter In February, 1839."
It Is certainly enough of an antique to
be made a fad of. It dates-back to the
Bible times and those of the Zend Avesta.
It was more popular than golf among the
ancient Greeks and Romans. Any little
boys of Old England who said a naughty
word, that rhymes with "lamb" were
whipped by command of the law. It is re
ported, too. that In the same Old Eng
landâMerrle Englandeâ "gentlemen , ar
ranged parties of pleasure to Bridewell
for the purpose of seeing the wretched
women who beat hemp there whipped."
Some New England lawyer remarked
that he would approve of the revival of
whipping when he indorsed the burning of
witches. He seems to voice a good many
people's sentiment. However, there Is no
telling how fashionable whipping may be
come before the century Is over. It may
be revived along with the old brass and
irons and dawfoot tables. Maryland re
vived 'it In the latter, part of the last cen
tury; and who knows that California
won't be following suit?
In 1SS7 the American Bar Association de
voted hours at their convention to the dis
cussion of the- problem. Nothing In par
ticular came of It all. but a great deal of
arguing was done. The pros said that ap-
proprlateness In punishment was the
great thing; that when their sinful little
sons pinched a sister's arm they must be
pinched themselves, and so with wife
beaters. They also argued that men like
sixty days or so when the landlady la ur

never like to be whipped.

"And how long do you have to devote
in practicing?" they were asked.
"We do not practice 'at alL We can
not' endure to work at the dancing any
longer than the required time of the per
formances."
To work at dancing. That is what it is
âwork. Dancing is something elsÂ© by
tradition, but not to these whirlwind peo
ple.
For every grand flourish is achieved at
a big cost to muscle, to agility, and above
all to nerves.
Will the nerves give out in the end?
Look at the two men. They have the
art of- the grasshopper, to be sure, but
no more physique.
Look at the two women. They are de
void of every, curve that easy living and
good health give. They are flat-chested.
as If they never had the time nor the re
pose to draw a long, lazy breath; They
are compounds of muscle and nerves.
Nature won't stand everything.
She protests in the end.
There is a terrific nervous tension about
the work, differing in that from every
other kind of dancing. Serpentine . or
skirt dancing are supposed to stand for
grace of motion. 'Â¦ They are a -kind of
calisthenics and are worth recommending
as gymnastic work. T'-U^? â¢'

ToÂ© dancing is excellent physical train

But whirlwind dancing Is another thing.
Every time that a great whirl is made
there Is a. nerve strain until It Is safely
through. One slip of a toe, one loosening
of the firm grasp of a hand and the Â«Â»ame
is up. As a man behind the scenes re
marked the other night when a gentleman
In black was whirling a pink lad/ through
the air by her arms:
"Golly! If one of her arms should pull
out, what a fall she'd get!"
She is flung through the air, toward the

I I them at the Orpheum, the Molas-

spinning, wheeling and whirling,
winding up each time with a giant pin
trheel flourishâ it looks like fun. to you.
"What do the Molasso-Salvaggis think
about it?
They think that the fun is on your side
of the footlights.
To render oneself a Fourth of July piri
vheel for seven nights out of the seven
and for plenty of matinees besides; to
â¢whirl one's body until one's brain whirls
too, out of sheer sympathy; -to drag one
self below stairs, exhausted, while a
greedy crowd above clamors for you to
do It all over again â that it Is to be a
Â¦whirlwind dancer.
And what is the end of It all?
There was once one of the tribe, De
Forrest by name, whom you have forgot
ten. You applauded her while she danced
for you, but now you have forgotten her.
For she has ceased to dance, and that
ceasing: meant the end of your memory.
Tou are the public
Why did she cease?
That Is a questlon^that nobody ever
asked at the time.
There were others, always others to
take her place.
Not many of them, to be sure, for they
knew what you have never heard, . per
haps, or having heard have forgotten.
The Madame de Forrest ,Â«rho dazzled
wings, with a force that would mean a
fearful accident If the grasp slipped.
This wear and tear of danser risked Is
the same that belongs to any acrobatic
performance. What . makes this work
worse is the dizziness that must be faced
and overcome.
Perhaps It never Is culte overcome.
The one who wears her hair in a fan on
top of her head came off the stage the
other night with a hand pressed to her
She staggered slightly.
She looked completely exhausted.
Remember that these whirls are com
plete, made all in one direction; that they
are not relieved by reversing as In other
dances.
That accounts for a good deal.
When these people began to learn ths
work, which Is so Ions ago that they have
to tap their foreheads to recall the time,
they could make only a part of the circle
at once. Their brains reeled.
Little by little, patiently, they at last
gained control of their dizziness. They
have learned not to show it to an audi
ence. . They leave the stage night after
night sick with fatigue, the blood rush
ing to the head. They are applauded â *
you want them back.
If you could see them as they drag
themselves to their dressing-rooms, you
would not blame them that they fall to
respond.
Every night feels as If it must be the
last. ->v.?

Tiedemann, George Theobald and A. W.
Wilding.
To-day the Alameda and Pacific cricket
elevens will meet on the ground at Web
ster street. Alameda for the fifth time this
season. The Pacific team has been much
strengthened by the' addition of Harold
Richardson, who . played in the Surrey
County eleven last year. In the Old Eng
land versus Young America match last
Sunday . he scored 4S runs and was run
out by a lucky throw-In by Croll from the
field! Had he not been run out it is prob
able that the Old England team would
have played out time and made a drawn
match of it. The defeat of the Old Eng
land men seems to have been due largely
to poor fielding, and bad judgment in the
disposition of their fielders. .But the Bird
brothers played excellent innings, hitting
freely, and- after they had got well set
gave few chances.
In the doubles Miss Hall and Miss Hoff
man will Join forces, and either they or
the Sutton sisters will probably bo the
first women champions of the coast ta
doubles. *.
In the mixed doubles tournament there
will be s!x teams, which will be picked by
the. committee. The best players are 'in
favor of having the contestants choose
partners, but the majority favor drawing
them by lot." The latter way would prob
ably be fairer* for everybody and produce
better results.
Miss Miriam Hall is the present coast
champion, and Miss May Sutton of South
ern California will be her most dangerous
opponent. All the best players, both wo
men and men, are practicing constantly
and these .will be the most successful
tournaments ever held here. ' t
As yet nothing: definite has been done
concerning the championship tournaments
to be played the latter part of this month
and the first of next. The ladies' tourna
ments will begin on August 26, and will
be completed on the 31st. The doubles and
mixed doubles will probably be played on
Monday and Tuesday, the first rounds ot
the singles on Wednesday and Thursday,
the finals on Friday and' the champion
ship match on Saturday afternoon.
The location of the courts, which is the
ground occupied by the old bandstand, is
a very good one, as there are wind breaks
on nearly all sides. The courts are the
regulation size, with the proper space on
the sides and backs. While asphalt courts
are hardly as fast as bitumen, still If kept
in good condition there is little difference
between them. It might be well to sug
gest to those in charge that the park
courts would be improved very much wera
they swept, rolled and watered every day,
or even every ofher day. Another matter
to which attention should be given Is the
erection of some structure containing
dressing-rooms. Tennis Is 'a game that
cannot be. properly played in street at
tire,.which Is found to be .also very un
comfortable. With these few suggestions
carried out, the park courts will be as
good as any turf courts in the State.
The public tennis courts being 1 built to
GcJden Gate Park are fast nearlng com
pletion. Of the five courts to be laid out
four are already finished and the fifth will
be completed In a week or two.

Cq-p^HE hunting grounds resound with the baying of hounds
II and the report of firearms. This is the season for deer
I hunting and the ruthless slaughter of the pronged
JJL quadruped Is now under way. So far very little slaugh
tering has been done, as deer have scented the coming
of the sportsmen from afar, and- like wise animals have
avoided a â¢ meeting. The dogs loll around in the hot sun and
â¢show little- inclination to chase the festive deer over the wilds
of Marin County. Hunters have been out in great numbers,
but. luck has befallen few of the shooters. :.
An expert, hunter assigns the lack of . success to three.
Firstrthe hot* weather that- prevail "/in Marin and
other counties; secondly, the poor condition of the dogs, and
"thirdly, moonlight nights. 1 , He claims that until the weather
becomes less torrid and the docs round into form and the moon
stops shedding its bright rays on the valleys the hunters will
enjoy better luck.
. In Marin County the hunters have had much to contend
with. In the day time the hot sun makes it uncomfortable
â¢ for them to' climb hills and force their way through unused
trails. In the afternoon the fog from the coast has had aj
tendency to hide the deer from sight. But all hunters are
hopeful and expect to bag some of the big game before the
season closes.
Among the hunters who are chasing the elusive deer may be
mentioned Alec Hamilton, Frank Carolan, Achille Roos, Harry
Hosmer, Dr. de Marville, W. S. Kittle, George Jackson, Al
Lahrke, Tom Walsh. John C. Nobman, E. B. Preston, F. W.
Van ' Slcklen. Robert Oxnard, .-Andrew , Jackson, John Lemmer,
George W. Root.General John H. . Dickinson, N. H. Hickman,
W. M. Cashman. J.- W. Crandall, George W. Smith, Fred S.
Johnson and others. '
Mr. Lewis of Tiburon is reported to have landed two bucks.
- He and a few friends have been hunting in the vicinity of No
vato and. have had average luck. v
The adventures of half a dozen local hunters have created
no end of discussion among the sportsmen. Dr. C. H. Bell, who
extracts teeth; C. F. Fuller;' who handles .drugs; G. F. Miller,
an upholsterer; Roy Fuller. Dr. , R. F. Millar and friend tried
their fortunes in the neighborhood of Pleasanton. On Friday
of last week. the sextet departed from this city with high hopes
. and two wagons. Owing to the strike they, were unable to se
''cure the. necessary vehicles to carry their guns, freight and
selves into the happy hunting grounds. In order to make the
trip Dr. Bell engaged a waffle wagon. The eight of this pecu
liar shaped vehicle, laden with men, guns and dogs, created no
end of surprise to the residents of the towns through which
they passed. The signs on the wagon had not been removed,
nor had the bell used for attracting attention to the wares on
sale. The occupants of the waffle wagon refrained from using
the bell, as they carried no "dough" and were not able to "make
good." They arrived at Pleasanton in good season and then
went In search of deer. Their luck was as good as that en
joyed by other sportsmen. Their stay was a delightful one,
' but their home-coming was not. In fact, Mr.' Miller, who was
driving the waffle wagon, ditched the vehicle and snapped one
of the springs. They managed, however, to reach the boat in
fairly good condition and the party was congratulating . itself
on soon being home. A reception awaited them on this side that
they did not bargain for. It was Sunday night and quite foggy,
but the strikers were ever watchful, and believing the driver of
the wafHe wagon to be a non-union man, proceeded to call him
a "scab." As the wagon slowly moved up Market street the
driver was greeted with choice words of abuse. Small boys
took up the cry of "scab" and followed the vehicle for many
blocks. The unhappy hunters bore the abuse and at the first
opportunity turned down a side street to avoid observation. The
st^ory of their ride has become public property and the sports
men have come in for their share of chaffing at the hands of
their friends. .
Dove shooting is not as good as in former years. According
to sportsmen it 'Â¦; too late in the season for these birds."
Doves are reported to be In number along Lindsay and Steam
boat creeks. There Is very little flight, however. The birds
roost in the trees and seem contented to stay there.
J. M. Duke went to Bodega last week and bagged thirty-five
doves in two days. â¢
Otto Feudner, the Olympic Gun Club's crack shot, has chal
lenged H. A. Webb for the Phil Bekeart trophy. They will
probably contest at Ingleside to-day. It' will be a 10O-blrd race.
Jack McGovern. the well-known turfite, has Just returned
from a dove-hunting: expedition to LIvermore. He reports that
game is plenty and that a good shot can spend several days
there and kill birds enough to keep the wolf from the door for
several days. McGovern says a good dog is the main thing in
Llvermore and saya that as his dog Collls is the "best ever"
he could not help being successful.

MANY OBSTACLES CONFRONT
THE LOCAL DEER HUNT.
H. R. Simpklns' little sloop Mistral is
lying on the beach at Old Sausalito. She
has a deep keel with several hundred
pounds' weight of lead bolted to it, and
is a handy knockabout boat which cost a
good deal to build, but is. for sale for
about the value of the lead on her keel.
The Corinthian sloop Speedwell left
Tiburon last Sunday afternoon for a
cruise up the Sacramento River with T.
Jennings, Ed and Mrs. Howard and Carl
Westerfeld on board. The party returned
to witness the Helen-Presto race yester
day. The sloop Cupid Is earning a repu
tation as the most regular attendant at
club cruises, a reputation that belonged a
eeason or two ago to the yawl Arcturus,
then owned by W. S. Grover.
Next Sunday, August IS. the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club will hold its annual
regatta. Hitherto these events have been
held over a triangular course from the
clubhouse at Sausalito to and round Shag
Rock, thence to and round a stakeboat
anchored off Angel Island, thence to the
clubhouse. This course gave spectators
on the clubhouse piazza an excellent view
of the racing and there were usually some
exciting knockdowns off Hurricane Gulch.
The race this year will be over a new
course, very much the same as the Cor
inthian course, except that the yachts will
sail to leeward instead' of to windward
after starting. The fleet will be divided
into classes according to the racing length
of the craft and It Is expected that almost
every boat enrolled in the club will take
part. It is to be hoped that the schooner
class, which Includes the Lurline, Aggie,
Virginia, White Wings, Ramona, Chlspa
and- Wave, will be well filled, as the
schooners are seldom seen in a race, and
always excitÂ«nnuch interest. t
The San Francisco yacht is being built
from Crownlnshield's designs and will be
sailed several times before the present
season closes. She will be laid up and
'carefully looked after during the 'winter
and next year will challenge for the Per
petual Cup.
The sloop Catherine, formerly owned by
the Sutherland brothers and recently won
In a raffle .by James Sutton, has been sold
to two members of the California Yacht
Club, who sailed her from Sausalito to
Oakland Creek last Sunday. The sloop Is
a fast one and actually won one of the
annual races for the Perpetual Cup, be
ins disqualified because of the inclusion in
the crew of Dan Eustis, a professional
boatman. With a new center-board cas
ing and suit of sails she would be quite
fit to make another try for the PerpetuaJ
Cup, for which the Callfornias have never
yet challenged, though early this season
It was reported that J. T. Carrier's sloop
Jessie E^ would try to win the trophy.
The up-river cruise of the Corinthians
begins next Saturday and the fleet will
rendezvous at Vallejo. on August 24, re
turning to moorings next day.
Next Saturday, August 17, the sloop
Ariel will start from Tiburon for a trip
up the Sacramento River with the fol
lowing on board: J. K. Bulger, J. Keane,
G. P. Aurich. E. - N. Boyle. W. J. Wood.
D. J. Sheehan and A. J. Nicholson. The
first night out the sloop will make Val
lejo, next night she will lie at Suisun,
whence she will pass through Montezuma
Slough into the Sacramento River.
The slocp Pactolus of the California
Yacht Club came to anchor last Sunday
in Tiburon Cove and its crew attended the
Corinthian elam-bake. To-day the Cali
fcrnias have a cruise in the channel on
their schedule. The rendezvous at Mc-
Near's Landing scheduled for the Co
rinthian and San Francisco Yacht clubs
last night was called off, as most of the
yachtsmen of both clubs desired to wit
ness the race for the Perpetual Challenge
Cup.
During the past week a larger fleet of
Fan Francisco yachts made Walnut Grove
its rendezvous than has been seen at one
place on the Sacramento River for a long
while. It is quite an unusual thing for
the owners and crews of half a dozen
yachts to be able to make arrangements
to get their annual holiday at the same
time. The fleet was in command of Vice
Commodore R. S. Bridgman of the sloop
Thetis and included the yawls Royal and
Phs'llis and the sloops Cygnus, Surprise
and . Mischief. W. Humphreys of the
sloop Mischief acted as pilot to the fleet.
YACHTSMEN ENJOY
FINE SAILS ON

The question of training greyhounds
and fitting them that they might go
through a high-class stake is one on
which there is a diversity of opinion.
The sport of the leash in California has
developed from an almost unpatronized
patne to one that holds sway with our
best attractions. The purses that-recom
pense the owners of winning hounds have
been increased, too, so that now there
Is a strong financial inducement added
to the glory to be won In a stake final.
The conditioning of a dog to the proper
point In training is an Important feature.
Tet the followers of the game know lit
tle or nothing of what is being done be
tween stakes to bring the performers to
the slips ready and worthy to compete
for their backing.
The best of our local trainers are tak
ing more kindly to the English system
and reducing the hard, wearing, rough
work In favor of the shorter and snap
pier exercise. Coursing men like' Sliar
man. Jones. McCaffery and the Curtis
boys have experimented to a great extent
in the endeavor to perfect a system of
training. Running dogs for miles behind
a cart en dusty roads finds no space on
the<r list of rules, for to them the snort
spurt has appealed as the most legiti
mate practice to give the necessary nre,
dash zvA speed.
The method of heavy training that -was
thought the proper thing in the early
davs in local coursing has been tried in
England and found wanting. Competent
judges in the old country were unani
mous in declaring that the speed of the
Purser was sacrificed for a few ounces
of strength. There are many dogs in our
local aggregation that are In the j running
from week to week and on the cards lor
alm^r every stake to which they are
eligible To give them that racking, pun-
SSS work in advance of their events
would mean an early retirement Â« a even
.take except in the occasional one where
mam strength is depended on to *ni out
on an extraordinary hare. â¢
Of course, .his does not mean that a
dog's strength should not be deve oped
and this mode of training is applicable
only to hounds that have been at the
game for a. time and that have passed the
preliminary stage
[ Joe Thrift broke away from the manner
of training that was in vogue for such a
long time and as an experiment put the
persistent Brutus through a course ac
cording to the new idea- Stamina was al
ready a pronounced characteristic of the
hound and further development of that
point was deemed unnecessary. The dog
was given only short spurts in his train
ing and the records for that season show
that as a result of the change Brutus fig
ured nine times in the final during the
6< Of Â°P J. ReiHy's dogs it is said that

will go up to a certainty if the course is
T long cne. for Rellly keeps his hounds
tell fed aT.d on strong food, which leaves
them in condition for a drawn-out final
to beat the cleverer opponent on main
strength alone. Despite the reputation of
the Reillv kennels in this regard the fact
remains "that speed will win nine times
out of ten. ,
Quite often when the subject of train
ing is mooted. a*nd especially after the
great sprinter Palo Alto has annexed a
etake one can hear the statement plaln
lv made that Geary's dog was not prop
erlv trained. With nothing but praise for
the champion, the speaker will denounce
whPt he terms the careless and lax meth
od of preparing the courser for Ms stakes.
"What a wonder that dog must be, they
areue "to take money in such fast corn
pan v 'when he is but half-trained and
what a greater wonder he would be if he
were handled properly."
While the argument sounds reasonable
the fact is plain on the summary that
Palo Alto made the best showing of last
reason, and besides heading the list of
money making winners broke all previous
records with nine stakes to his credit. To
<the fact that ne is but half-trained in his
I engagements Palo Alto owes his standing
' ss a breadwinner, for his case Is one of a
few that have proved exceptions to the
regular methods of preparation. He per
forms better under the training that is
better fitted to his peculiar habits.
Instances where dogs practically un
trained have gone through stakes to a
successful final are not uncommon in Ens
land The result has always caused com
ment, as in the case of Palo Alto, and
would finally suggest the theory that the
showing could be improved with the
benefit of hard work. In every case the
training and feeding in the manner laid
down by rule proved the undoing of the
dog 'and left him unfitted to perform up
to the usual standard.
Our home records will bear witness to
instances where untrained hounds have
captured honors in stakes where their op
ponents were the pick of the season. Right

Merced meeting, but gave it no attention
until quite late. He w,ent in search of an

but they rarely make any extended trips
as the tides and currents are- so strong
as to render such excursions somewhat
risky. -Indeed, even men who are well ac
customed to handling the oara often have
quite a struggle to get around Belveder*
Point when the tide is running against
them. Few ladies are better known In
Tiburor. Cove than the Misses O'Brien,
sisters-in-law of Port Captain John H.
Keefe. They are regular attendants at
all entertainments of the Corinthian
Yacht Club' to which ladies are admitted
and use a pair of sculls quite handily.
The Seven Bells is the swell yacht
owned and sailed by Mr. and Mrs. Andrew
Thorne. They . spend many happy hours
aboard/Sometimes they are accompanied
by several guests. All envy the fortunate
ones who receive an invitation.
Miss Elizabeth Chapman Â«*s a skilled
sailor maid, who keeps her "weather eye"
open. She loves the waves and ocean
breezes. They are lucky who ,occupy the
cockpit while she stands at the wheel.
Dr. Haslacher is one of the most enthusi
astic yachtsmen on the bay and he is oc
casionally accompanied by his charming
wife. She would rather stay ashore,
though, when the. sea is choppy and plan
cruises and . cheer some "discouraged
novice.
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Mattoon. Miss
Mangin, Miss Eleanor Mangin, Miss Helt

Majbel Hopkins and j Miss Johnson are
prominent among those skilled and Inter

: The clubhouse around which ladies are
mo3t frequently seen in this bay is the
Encinal Yacht Club house at Alameda: but
they go the re chiefly in the mornings fcr
Lathing aril in the evenings for social di
version. The Encinal Yacht Club owns
so few yachts now that sailing is but in
unimportant part of its activities. Tha
Encinal and the San Francisco Yacht
clubs are the only two which give dances
during the season, the Corinthians giving
one on the afternoon of opening day only.
But the San* Franciscos have found that,
while their dances are well attended and
apparently much enjoyed, few of their
own members come, so that the benefit to
the club is slight. A clam bake recently
given at Paradise Cove by some energetic
members of the club was so successful
and provided so. much entertainment that
it has been decided to eliminate the dance
set down on the programme for Septem
ber 14 and substitute a clam bake, which
will be managed by the club officers.
Yachting has not been in so flourishing
a condition for 'many years in San Fran
cisco Bay as now. All the clubs are gain
ing in membership and there is plenty of
enthusiasm. The Pacific Interclub
Yacht Association has been re-established
the Misses Clay.- They are "every inch"
sailors. ; They can^ "feather" their oars
with the skill of a veteran and can do a
trick at the wheel or trim the sails as well
as a first class naval apprentice/;* Almost
any pleasant day they, can be seen cruis
ing around in their trim little yacht, the
Pactolus. ,'- Occasionally their father and
mother take a short trip with them.
Among ladies who are really fond of
yachting may be mentioned Mrs. Frank
Bartlett, whose husband owned the yacht
Dawn, then the sloop Queen and who v is
now part owner of the sloop Spray. Mr.
and Mrs. Bartlett have made several trips
up" the Sacramento River and have prob
ably been up every creek and stream
flowii.jt into the bay^where thero is water
enough to sail. Ed Bartlett,- Frank's
brother, was for several years owner of
'the large yawl Frolic, and during that
time Mr 3. Ed Bartlett was constantly out
on the. bay; 'indeed, .she is probably the
handiest woman on a yacht to be found
in these waters.. Another enthusiastic
sailor woman is'Mrs. Young, wife. of Alex
J. Young, formerly commodore of the Co

. of the large sloop Clara. : . Miss Roberta
Clay,- daughter of Allen M. Clay, presi

and never dreams of getting squeamish.
It. is said that she can niake sail on the
yacht and cast off from ,the moorings
without masculine help of any kind.
George D. Campbell of the San Francisco
Yacht Club, who has sailed- the 1 cutter
Folly for the last two or -three seasons,
but who is now in Alaska, frequently had
his wife as his sole companion during his
sailing trips. Dr. T. Lr. Hill, ex-commo
dore of the : San \Yacht Club
and owner formerly of the sloop Grade,
but now of the sloop Cygnus, is a fervent
believer in the practice Â¦ of husbands and
wives joining in the. same recreation and
pastimes; hence Mrs. "Tom" Hill, with
h*'~ intimate friend, 'Mrs. "Charley" Hill,
takes frequent sailing .tripsâ indeed, at

the summer. The fierce wind "dies^ down

When a long trip is desired the girls
generally prefer a cruise to Mare Island
or Benicia; but sometimes when crossing
San Pablo Bay in the afternoon the eea

the boys like beavers..' It Is enough to
frighten you to see a bold sailor girl run

With hair flying, skirts blowing in the

ests the San Francisco girl as ' much *s
yachting. What does she care if her soft

and stream out Â¦ f ron*. her head like the

A race for the Perpetual Challenge Cup
took place yesterday and already on* Is la
sight for 1902, the San Francisco Yacht
Club having already set to work to- build
a fin-keel racing yacht from designs by.
Crowninshield of Boston, with, -which to
challenge the winners and present hold
ers of the trophy, which is regarded u
the bluÂ© ribbon of local yachting.
As most of the yachts owned In this >Â«.y
are of only moderate size, ladies do not
usually take trips overnight. The favorite
destination for a day's sail Is Paradise
Cove, between California City and El
Campo,' for there good holding ground is
found for the anchor, and the shore offers
fine opportunities for an, al fresco lunch
eon under the trees and a pleasant stroll
afterward. McNears Landing is anothe*
pretty spot, where a dance may be en
joyed and a bath taken In an enclosed
pool, the water of which is warmer than
that of the outside bay. A mile or so from
the dance hall is a Chinese shrimp- fishers'
camp and a considerable settlement oÂ£
Mongolians. The curious methods of dry
ing and winnowing the- shrimps,, and the
strange craft employed In the industry
are always interesting.
There is a woman who navigates a "real
live tug," the Ethel and Marion, In the
waters of the bay of San Francisco. Her
husband, Captain Charles Thorrold, was
a veteran in the business and Mrs. Thor- -
rold was his ever present companion. ShÂ»
learned every rope, every signal, every
"freak" on the stanch little craft- When
her husband died she assumed complete
control of the tug. She could not do|any
regular business at first with ship owners
because she possessed no legal right to do
so. She employed a "figurehead" master
to go with her, and although his salary
took a snug sum out of the receipts, she
had money to bank. Later she got her
license.
In talking about her first venture she
said:
"I had thought of this move for two or
three years after my husband's death."
Somehow or other I was deterred from
making a decisive move until my children
voted for it so enthusiastically that I
yielded. In fact, my husband was unfor
tunate in his financial transactions and
when he died I had only a moderate In

about my decision.
"I thought of other women In the 'city
who were entering upon a- legitimate bus

lawyers, some as storekeepers; why not
as sailing- masters?" Â»
Why not, indeed? Mrs. Thorrold has

UP TO-DATE JOLLY LADY TARSMany kinds of yachting women arÂ«r
there. .There is the sort that can 'never

is the girl who cannot - get | away from
home for a breath of the sea; there is the
woman who â¢, must ( plan the tri-daily

the cradle. But they are yachting women;
just the same,, for they read yachting and
they talk yachts; and, over the cradle and.

she go to sea. ' .
' The Woman Who Stays Home.
It is she who thinks of a sea food soup
and she who knows' how the J finny tribe
can 'best be turned to good account In the
setting of a friendly board.' J She^ never
overdoes the matter, this ; lady tar, but
she provides ; a dinner which , the yachts

ashore. At best, yachting is but a -dry
occupation, and, : even : while engaged in
the excitement of the sail, the yachtsman

j There is another type of yachtswoman,
one you' frequently see these -days. She
knows nothing about yachting, but she
dresses as a jolly lady tar and she lives
ashore. She doesn't go aboard "the boat,
but stays on land and talks yacht. It is
she who gives yachting luncheons and she
who attends yachting suppers, and she
who is authority on the menus for yacht
ing dinners. . â¢
She is ! a law unto herself, the society
type, a piece of j charming femininity,
something one cherishes and loves, and
it is she who generally lands the yachts
man as her own; she'who gets a husband
when the others wait for a proposal.
The Jolly Lady Tar.
To the society type the man who- can
sail a yacht is 'a hero, and it is she who,
on account of her great, appreciation, is
invited to go when others are either left
ashore or put aboard the observation
boat, which is heaVy.and goes ponderous
ly upon' its way" without the terrifying
duckings of the little yacht, v

is too mucn to be born with equanimity.
But one must get used to all things cup
years.
rrw NT) now it is thÂ« yachting girl.
f I The golf girl has put away her
f-â 4 cleek and banished her caddy;
V, I the piazza girl has forgotten to
X pose; the hammock girl has risen
from, her attitude of gracefulness and
has sprung into activity; the tennis girl
has forgotten her racket, while all have
joined with, a unanimity in the one great
interest of the day. which is yachting.
The yachting girl is ever so nautical.
She knows all about the sails and' can
talk of them and their peculiarities to
you by the hour. She thoroughly under
stands the art of boat building and she
knows all the tricks of yacht sailing,
from the minute the yacht is launched
and Elides down her ways, to the time
when, sails in trim shape, she Is laid
aside and goes Into drydock for the win
ter.
It is the fashion to be a yachting girl
nowadays, and the girl who made It a
practice to carry her racket In the street,
or who enjoyed lugging the caddy, now
prefers to wear a yachting gown and to
appear in public In the full Insignia of her
yachting glory.'
The Tommy Lipton Giri.
There are several kinds of yachting
girls, Just as there are varieties in the
sands of the sea. There is the fragile
girl who sits one side and sips lemonade
and gin cocktails; and then there is the
Tommy Lipton girl, the one who can get
out upon the deck and boss things. She
3 loves to ship as mates mate, and she
likes nothing better than handling the
ropes. She is generally pretty, the Tom
my Lipton girl, or she would not be tol
erated, but, as it is. they are glad to
have her around, because she is so
amusing, though she does make trouble
and is awfully in the way.
The Tommy Lipton girl is a product of
America. They would not own her
abroad. Lady Dufferin. who knows a
thing or two about yachts, and Mrs.
Lucy Carnegie, who Is the cleverest
yachtswoman in the world, are quite dif
ferent from the Tommy Lipton girl, and
would not presume where fhe hesitates
not to rush in. But they all love her,
from the cup defender down to the cap
tain, and from the captain to the sail
or*, so she continues to hold sway. On
every yacht you can see her.
The English yachtswoman is quite a
different order from the American type.
She Is extremely secluded. Lily Langtry
Is quite an excellent example of the true
English sailing woman. She loves to
lounge on deck and to languidly sniff the
K2.lt air. but when the breezes blow she
generally goes below, and. like Joseph
Porter. K. C. B., of "Pinafore" fame, is
mere for ornament than for actual use.
But the Englishman prefers bis woman
that way. He likes her as an ornament,
pot as an assistant. /To her he is an
austere companion, and, when she ap

The society type comes from Newport.
All In softest and most perishable mate
rials, she steps atoard the yacht, and with
a little scream becomes righted and pre
pares to tnjoy the day. .
The society type of yachtswoman, is a
very friendly one. She is not such a s'ood
sailor, but phe" '.b such a good fellow. With
an" American flag in one hand and the
Stars and Stripes back of her, she will sit
and sip claret lemonades and listen. She is
an excellent listener, this society type,
and you like her because ehe hears your
sea stories and laughs at and appreciates
them.
It is this type that cheers you on in
spite of discouragement. In the calm mo
ments, when no progress can be made, she
jests, and when the adverse winds blow
Ehe tells you how to turn them your way.
"It is like life," she reminds youâ "the
winds. It depends upon the way you
handle them. All yachts have sails; yet
some boats go one and some go another
wayâ all propelled by the same wind."
Her logic is supreme; her good ch"eer is
infectious. .
The mascot is a never-to-be-forgotten
thing in the chronicles of yacht tailing.
Without it no favoring wind can puff;
with it the sails inflate and the yacht
sails swift, even in the teeth of the gale.
The Boat's Mascot.
Should the breezes blow and an icy blast
strike across the decks she slips below
and comes out brave in a sealskin coat;
should the wind die down and a calm lie
over the water, while the sails hang list
lessly, it is she who throws off the seal
coat and gets into a mysterious jacket,
which seems <=omehow to bring cooling
thoughts with it. She is always comfort
able, the Mrs. Iselin type, and, what is
more, sho has always a mascot with her.
The Mrs. Iselin type carries an immense
wardrobe with her, but it is an outside
wardrobe, ready to be slipped on or taken
off at a second's notice. It consists not of
gowns, but wraps, and she is proof against
colds, coughs and consumption.
The Mrs. Iselin type Is an inveterate
yachtswoman. She does not "dress" at all,
but wears one suit always; usually she se
lects a dark blue, because it does not
show the weather and because it looks as
rice at one time as another.
Tho Mrs. Iselin type of yachtswoman is
a most charming creature. She is aboard
yacht not to command, but to chter. She
is pretty always, and vivacious very. She
is a woman who is ready to entertain at
any time and who is always entertained,
whether any one is entertaining her or
not. Â£he has a smile, the Mrs. Iselin type,
and she is chtpper and cheery from morn
ing to night.

boss. No Englishwoman handles the ropes
unless It be languidly and with laughter,
uncertainly, and with masculine guidance.

"We have protested again and again. In the
first place, that the police are acting as team
sters for the employers, that they direct those
men who have been imported to take our places
and Â¦who are unfamiliar with the city, and that
they even help them in the management of
the vehicles and the goods. We have protested,

bias and have used unnecessary violence in
dealing with peaceable and orderly, crowds of

air. "Newhall therefore haa used his official
position against the Interests of the working
men, and ilr. Newhall is therefore unfit to be
a member of a government that is bound to
treat labor and capital with equal justice.
This use of the police is unfair to us. It ad
vertises to our fellow citizens tho accusation
that we are law breakers, who- would destroy
our employers' property if not restrained by an
overwhelming show of force. It was a cun
ning move on the part of the employers to put
us In the wrong. We know now why such a
move was possible. Mr. George A. Newhall is
a member of the Police Â¦ Commission, and Mr.
George A. Newhall is a leader of those who are
fighting our right to organize to protect our
selves.
The workingmen of this dtr have again and
again protested to your Honor against the as
sumption that they are the law breakers. It is
a dictate of justice and a. maxim of law that no
n-.an be treated as a suspected criminal until
there be some evidence against him. There has
been absolutely no evidence that the men now
-locked out of employment by the Employers'
Association are law breakers. Tet the police
of this city paid by our taxes as well as by the
taxes of every other class have been put on
ve-hicles driven for the employers to protect
them against a violence that was never offered
and which was not even thought of.
The author of such a libel Is not a fit or
proper person to be a member of thÂ« govern
ment of San Francisco.
Violence UTever Offered.
Tbe average number of dally assaults, af
frays. Quarrels, has been no greater "during
the strike than during any other equal period
of the past year. Whatever exceptional vio
lence has occurred has been Initiated by and
is to be laid at the door of the employers,
of those they are using to hurt us and of the
police themselves. The city is peaceful. The
assertions of. Mr. Xewhall are a libel not only
on the worklngmen, but on all the citizens
of this town.
That statement Is untrue. It is untrue to
day. It was untrue yesterday. It is untrue
of every day einoe the strike began. Never
has so great a lockout and strike been main
tained with so little disturbance. And the
credit is due not to the employers, not to the
Police Commission, not to the police, but to
the worklngmen and to their unions.
In Â¦writing tils letter he has. with a disregard
for facts extraordinary in a man chosen for
so important a position as Police Commissioner,
etated that this city is the prey of violence,
& scene of riot where police and even soldiers
are required to restore the peace and to protect
life and liberty.
In writing this letter George A. Xewhall
has. In a manner unparalleled for its Indecency,
forsaken the impartiality demanded of a mem
ber of the city government, and has thrown
his Influence and. the influence of his office
against the worklngman in the present dispute
now agitating the city.
Tti^ti<Â»ti/ > .<Â» A pn^Ti sr. w r>f Viti grn a n .
George A. Newhall is unfit for the position of
Police Commissioner in San Francisco, because
he has slandered this city and the people there
of. He is unfit because he is using the influence
of the city government for one class against
another. He Â¦ is unfit because he is a veritable
Therefore we come with confidence to your
Honor to ask that you exercise the powers com
mitted to you by the charter and remove George.
A Newhall from the office of Police Commis
sioner We demand this in the name of all the
fair-minded people of this city, who desire Jus
tice and peace. George A. Newhall has tam
pered with the even balance which the govern
ment should hold between all classes in this
community. The claims of labor were in the
one scale, the claims of the employers were in
the other. George A. Newhall came and threw
the policeman's baton into tbe scale against us,
and, having found that even that was ineffect
ual to turn the balance against justice, he now
clamors to your Honor to cast in the soldier's
rifle.
Newhall's Removal .Demanded.
"The strike has not developed violence
demanding the sort of measures suggest
ed by the Chamber of Commerce." said
the Mayor last evening. "There have not
been riots or outbreaks that were not eas
ily suppressed by the police. Calling for
State aid would be entirely out of the
American citizens, xrho have as much right
to line the sidewalks on the 4th of August aÂ«
they have on the Fourth of July. We can now
understand the zeal of the police. The police
are men of our own class. Naturally their
sympathies would be with ub. " But they are
human. Their hopes of advancement, of re
ward, of promotion are in the Police Commis
sion. Mr. Newhall is no Insignificant part of
the Police Commission. The police know his
sentiments; More police, aye. even call in
the soldiers. Is It any wonder that they would
be zealous in guiding teamsters? Is It any
wonder that their eyes would be sharpened to
detect the beginning of riot? Is it any won
der that their batons would fall a little heav
ier on strikers' heads when they knew that
George A. Newhall was looking on with the
colors of the employers in his button-hole,
with his eye ensanguined with prophecies of
fire and riot, and with his august thumb
turned down to decree no mercy to labor?
The police should, as the Immediate repre
sentatives of the law, be as impartial as the
law itself. The police cannot be impartial
when the head of the commission, to which
they look for orders and promotion, is rabidly
opposed to one side of the community. George
A. Xewhall Is a perpetual incentive to the
police to break the peace. George A. Xewhall
is unfit to be a Police Commissioner.
p-râ^HE communication addressed to
I Mayor Phelan Friday by the
I directors of the Chamber of Com-
H merce was followed by another
yesterday from the Board of Trade
urging upon the Mayor the issuance of a
proclamation declaring that peace must
be preserved and personal property rights
respected. Mayor Phelan holds that such
a proclamation Is unnecessary and would
be gratuitous, and a possible cause of vio
lence rather than operating to allay it.
The Mayor so replied to the Chamber of
Commerce, and his position is not
changed since the Board of Trade commu
nication was drafted. â¢
"So far employers and* strikers are act
ing within their legal rights. The policy
of the police is to prevent conflicts in or
der to avoid the necessity of making ar
rests or using repressive measures. This
plan averts trouble and keeps the hot
heads from assaulting teamsters. No man
pursuing his legal rights will be exposed
to danger if the police can help it. Every
"Of course, we cannot furnish policemen
to an unlimited number to protect indi
vidual worklngmen. There cannot be a
remedy for the situation in the augmenta
tion of the police force, for the tax levy
has been made providing only for the
present numerical strength of the depart
ment. When merchants have applied to
have certain men appointed special of
ficers to guard their property or protect
their employes the appointments have
been made, and will continue to be made
upon request. While I do, not advise that
course, it is the only method of meeting
the conditions that prevail.
question. There has been no occasion
whatever for calling out the National
Guard.
the association to swear in 200 special
policemen at their meeting Tuesday night.
These specials will be used to guard the
number of additional wagons which the
draymen intend to send out. At present
all the trucks and wagons are out for
which there is police protection.
There is a report in circulation to the
effect that a number of the striking steve
dores and longshoremen ' have put In ap
plication to be sworn in as special police
men. The members of the Draymen's As
sociation do not relish the idea of having
the strikers as guards for the non-union
teamsters and therefore each applicant
will be required to show that he is not
out on. strike. -.y. â¢ Â¦
one knows that violence Is no remedy un
der American institutions and with the
American people, and the labor organiza
tions know it well, for they have advised
their men' not even to be provoked into
acts of violence. It has been said that the
police have served the employers. That is
wrong. They have preserved the peace. In
the same sense the police have served the
unions, because the unions are co-operat
ing to prevent violence. Violence is fatal
to the cause of labor. The man who com
mits an overt act condemns his cause.
The killing of the soldiers and the en
gineer on the wrecked locomotive by a
crazy fool broke the railroad strike in
1894. As soon as violence is resorted to it
becomes a question of upholding the law,
and the sympathy and support of the
whole community Is arrayed on the side
of law. If industrial battles are to be
fought; they must be by peaceful and
legal weapons. So long as this condition
prevails there Is no necessity, so far as
I can see, for a proclamation. The least
show of violence/ however, will call forth
the sternest measures." . .

The detectives, and there were many of
them, had an easy task to ferret out what
developed into the most unique of all rob
beries. On Tuesday morning when the
theft had been discovered Pete Donaldson,
the supposed accomplice of Winters, came
to Superintendent von der Ropp and told
him that he had seen the. robber hanging
about the smelting works and acting sus
piciously. Winters was also discovered
accidentally at 4:30 on the morning of the
robbery leaving the shore for his cabin
home on the hillside down the road.
Others then remembered that he was seen
underneath the wharf from which the
gold was dropped into the shallow waters.
These were the very first clews the.detec
tives worked on. The discovery of Win
ters was a foregone conclusion.
Easy Task for Detectives.
Chained to the floor and feeling the ut
ter uselessness of holding out against the
hand of the law, \ Winters confessed Fri
day afternoon . not only to his guilt, but
to the hiding place of the gold. He con
fessed not because he was badgered and
mentally torn asunder - by the Vsweat"
process. The evidence they piled up before
him looked like the forbidding mountains.
They even told him where the bullion was
and that In a short time it would be.re
covered and returned to its rightful own
ers. Then revengeful law was pictured
with all the weary years of penitentiary
suffering. This moved ' him but little.
When Lees and Seymour had finished
their churning Winters called for Super
intendent von der Ropp of the Selby
works. Von der Ropp talked sympathet
ically to him, advising confession before
it was too late. He spoke of possible le
niency on the part of humane Judges, of
the injustice to fellow workmen under
suspicion and, most of all, of the strong
chain of evidence coiled around the sus
pect.
Â¦ Winters seemed a little less obdurate,
but still fought against self-incrimlnation.
Then came Von der Ropp's final stroke.
He promised money and reduction of pun
ishment for a confession. The visions of
a lengthy, wearisome; term in prison had
passed before the suspect's mind and he
seemed disheartened. Then came the'con
trastâa few years and several thousands
of dollars, maybe five. t maybe ten. if he
would disclose where he had concealed the
gold. Von der Ropp won out and the wit
ness bating was over. Then came the
tug ride and the 1 fishing up of the gold
bricks, which is the final chapter. I
Confessed for Money.
And so the greatest bullipn robbery of
all time has fizzled out afteV a beginning
that was as fruitful of striking incident
as the cream chapter, in a saffron-hued
novel. Its artistic simplicity in the first
stages made the name of Winters, or
Buck Taylor as he . would always be
known among professional cracksmen,
one to be engraved on the book of big,
featural crime. â¢ To-day there Is not a
criminal of reputation who would give
him a thought. The robbery was the

to the degrading distinction of even a
noteworthy criminal.
bullion was found. Then again Winters
confessed, something which the profes
sional detective views without respect.
Ofke of the keenest who has been at work
on the case said yesterday: "Winters was
an actor. It looks as If he played at rob
bery just to see what he could do and
spend a nice portion of his life in stripes
and behind the bars in realizing it." â¢
Â¦ The. 525.000; offered in reward ' for the
capture of the thief and the recovery of
the money, will -be productive of. more
than one wordy,. fierce tattle among the
detectives. From pre.ieht indications it
seems as if, the division â¢â¢ would 'â¢Â¦ include
Captain Seymour, Detective Savers of tho
Plnkerton force and Tom Gibson. Gibson
did specially good work on the case and
made the arrest through the letter found
in Winters', cabinâ the letter from Miss
Ida Spencer of San Rafael. Lees was em
ployed by the Selbys and received a big
consideration for his. work. Â¦,. Â¦, ;

- When his tale was done Winters lapsed
into silence and fell into a speli of
thought. . . , ,, : "â¢- Â¦â¢Â¦- -
Oh, I had a scheme for disposing of
the. gold. I would have dug it up and
every once In a while taken , a couple of
bars -to Germany or other countries and
sold it. " After working as^hard for it as
1 did I was going to make use of all that
I got. The $150,000 left in the safe I wanted
also, but did not have' the time."
"It was a tedious job, but at no time
did I falter. You seem surprised to hear
that I worked within ear shot of the men
at the furnaces. Only once did they hear
me, and that was when I forced the hole
after the 136 borings. That was the 'ghost
or devil' which McGlynn i mentioned.
Why, while I was working, night after
night one of the men would come for air
to a window not three feet distant from
me. There. I lay- on the ground and there
he was looking out into the dark. Of
course I escaped discovery. He couldn't
see into the dark just after looking into
a hot furnace. When he got cooled he
would return- to his work.
Why He Left Two Behind.
. "I made fourteen : trips altogether In
packing the gold through the bridge. The
two bars which -I left on the rocks were
not left for sentimental or Ingenious rea
sons. A Chinese coming along road
disturbed ma and I>ft the locality in a
hurry. Â¦
"For six weeks I worked on the vault
and the trick showed I did not work with
out results. I knew all about the interior
of the vault and worked accordingly. The
opening which I cut out In order to enter
was made purposely oval in shape. If it
had. been circular it would have cut under
neath the tracks on which the car .was
run into, the vault.
Compared with this amateur conduct

self was conducted. On *" Friday â¢ night,

No detection ever seemed surer when
the detectives reached the cabin. First
there was the chalk corresponding to that
found in the tunnel under the vault, then
the gun filled with the same character
of earth,. the scoopings of the shovel, the
shovel itself, the tacks and the cloth and
the frame, the oak block, the burned

thought of the destruction of material
evidence he left his cabin Tuesday morn
ing post haste to San Rafael to the side
of a young woman for whom, he is sup
posed to have a fond affection. 'With the
traces of guilt left behind him he really
invited the sleuths to charge him with
the crime. And then circumstance after
circumstance began to dovetail until he
was completely encased. The confession
on Friday clinched It all and after an
easy search the detectives will divide the
$25,000 reward offered and smile in the
doing. . Â¦ . -

STOCKTON. Aug. 10.â Jack Winters,
who has confessed to being the man who
robbed the Selby Smelting Works of J2S0,

nized by attaches of St. Joseph's Home in
this city as being the same man who
robbed the institution of $400 in coin on
the 29th of March last.
ACCUSE WINTERS OF
ROBBING ST. JOSEPH'S
A careful day and night watch will be
maintained on the maritime "cache" of
Winters, and the work of diving for tho
treasure will be resumed to-day. Steps
were taken yesterday by the Selby man
agement to have a cofferdam built with
out delay, so that the balance of the srold
bars can be recovered. The water when*
Winters walked up and down the wharf
and played "chuck stone" with gold bar*
Is very muddy. The silt is about four feet
deep, and the heavy bars of Â¥ ?oid havi
presumably sunk into the slimy mass.
Winters stated yesterday that he threw
the four big gold bars Into the water
without any covering, while one sack of
smaller bars burst open as h<Â» was just
about to throw it into the water.
Shortly after the noon hour some Por
tuguese employes of the Selby Works
were allowed to dive in the muddy water
Jn the hope that they might bring up
some of the gold bars.- After working 1
about two hours one of the men caught
hold of a sack and hauled it into shallow
water. On being opened it was found to
contain four small bara, valued at $11,000.
The bars were conveyed to the smelter
works by a trusted employe of the Selby3 ,
and the "find" was credited to the "re
covery account," which then totaled up
to $141,000, or exactly half of the big sum
stolen by Winters.
A curious throng congregated on tha
rocks near the place where a small for
tune was hidden, but no one was allowed
to enter the water to search far the treas
ure.
The superintendent proceeded to thÂ»
Selby works to spread the good news
among his associates, while Constable
Moiles and Detective Sllvey carefully
guarded the location where more than
half of Winters' booty lay embedded In
the mud.
The recovered gold bars were taken on
board the tug and guarded by an officer.
Then the entire party with Winters, ex
cepting Constable Moiles, Detective Sllvey
and Superintendent Von der Ropp, board- v
ed the tug and headed for San Francisco, j

ers, and walked about sixty-flve feet and
showed another plank, the end of which
had been recently severed. The two
planks were the limits in which Winters
said the gold would be found in the water
between the wharf and the rocks of thd
railroad track.
Then he started to walk about thirty
ieet toward the junction and showed the
officers where the end of a plank had been
newly sawed off. Again- he turned In the
opposite direction, toward the coal bunk-
"There is no need of going anv closer to
the wharf than this." Taking another
piece of coal from his pocket Winters
hurled it about- eight feet out in the water,
toward the railroad track, at the same
time saying: ."And you don't want to go
any further. from the wharf than that."
. Superintendent , Von der Ropp was at
the side of Winters during the time he
wa3 engaged in showing just where the
gold had been thrown from. Winters sug
gested that it might be good policy to
build a cofferdam in order to recover the
balance of the treasure. . Taking a piece
of coal in his right hand Winters walked
to a certain spot and â¢ dropping the coal
right* dawn by the Â« piling.- said:
Tells Wliere More Bullion Is.
' Turning to the officers, Winters request
ed that the workman "be sept away and
the look on the prisoner's face showed
plainly that he thought the rope was In
tended for summary justice.
The workman evidently thought that a
rope would be of some use in the search,
but Winters placed a different conclusion
on the proposition. "What do you know?"
said Winters excitedly. "What do you
want? I never talked'to you before. You
don't know anything about me/*
Coolly and deliberately Winters acted
until a workman from the smelter Â¦walked
up with a rope in his hand and greeting
the prisoner, said: "Here Is a rope. Jack."
Winters walked toward the coal bunk
ers and picked up some small pieces of
coal and then returned to a spot on the
wharf about 150 yards from the junction.
With a piece of a cracker box held down
by a lump of coal he showed the officers
the exact place where he stood when he
heaved the sack containing the four
heavy bars of fine sold.
The detectives /refused to allow any
newspaper men to speak to Winters when
he left the tug for the second time and
walked up and down the wharf. He was
allowed to take sufficient exerciset to
counteract his long Immersion in the
water and then was asked by Superin
tendent Von der Ropp to designate just
where he stood when he threw the gold
laden sacks into the water.
Winters, after the first sack had been
discovered, took oft his clothes and waded
into the water to aid the officers In their
search. He acted nervously, but a
stranger witnessing the early morning
scene would never have suspected that
Winters was the man guilty of a gigantic
robbery, not in its cunning, but in the
value of the loot.
The minutes slipped along swiftly as
the detectives with Winters waded in the
muddy water near the coal wharf and
bunkers. Within an hour five sacks had
been recovered, containing twenty-one
bars of gold, valued at $130,000. The In
coming of the tide prevented further
work being done and it was decided to
suspend operations. The detectives and
Winters, who had spent an hour in the
cold water, were assisted on the tug and
shortly afterward they came out on the
deck, looking none, the worse for wear. Â¦

."I have found Peruna an ideal tonic.
Some months ago I suffered with 'neuras-

too close application to office work. My
system seemed worn out and I felt far
from well. I found Peruna benefited me
very much. It built up the- entire sys-
tem and made me feel like a new man. I
believe it Is well worthy the high praise
bestowed upon it."â J. A. Simpson.
Systemic catarrh always gives fair
warning of its approach, and can be
easily warded oft by the proper treat-
ment. Floating brown specks before
the eyes, mental confusion, fits of nerv-
ous headache, sleeplessness, flashes of
heat, chilly sensations, palpitation. Irri-
tability, despondency; any of these
symptoms or all of them should be
promptly met by the use of Peruna.

fer began his final tour among the strik
ers early to-day. He left Pittsburg this
morning, and. shortly before noon reached
Newcastle. . - Two thousand- organized
workmen paraded there before his arrival
and were lined up around the station as
he arrived. In the afternoon he spoke to
6000 people in the amphitheater at Cas
cade Park, and submitted an offer for the
submission of the issues of the strike to
arbitration. This was his formal tender
for arbitration:
"Now, in our willingness to settle the
matter we are ready to arbitrate. Let the
Amalgamated Association select one man
and the trust select, one man, the two to
select the third. We will abide by the de
cision of the three. I wish this to be gen
erally known."
In his speech Shaffer said the strike was
a matter of wages and labor conditions,
notwithstanding the efforts'of the opposi
tion to prejudice the labor cause by alle
gations to the contrary. He added:
'"The trust will not permit the extennion
of unionism, because it states that the
Amalgamated Association might become
too strong. We can make our own deduc
tions relative to the meaning of this ex
pression."
President Shaffer stated that the news
papers had been criticizing him because
he had not stated whether or not there
would be an effort to call out the carpen
ters, railroad men and all other organiza
tions in an effort to gain a favorable ter
mination. He added: .
"We do not want revolution. This is
merely a strike. I wish it understood
that I stand for no violence. Our inter

President Shaffer, President Gompers,

for the submission of the question agreed
upon. It. is believed that President Shaf

"This is no time for arbitration."

ness of the Amalgamated Association to
arbitrate . was followed here ; to-night by
the announcement on behalf of the strik

was formally submitted to the United

this statement, the offer was referred to
J. P. Morgan, whose" reply rejecting it
was: i .
"The men who made McKeesport made
the trust. They now threaten our rights
and deny our liberties. I call on you,
men of McKeesport, to throw off the op
pressors and the system of spoliation, re
venge and reprisal. This is no time for
weakness; no time for truce; no time rtir
cowardice. .You cannot yield; you will not
surrender, for it means reduction of wages
and ignominious slavery. Let our gar
ments become threadbare; let some of us

member this, even if the .Amalgamated
Association should be overthrown it
would only mean a greater brotherhood

victory." â¢ Â¦ , -

ter saying that the workingmen have - a

on the. banks or impair, the credit of , the

came to the meeting. He made his propo
sition to me and I asked him to put it
in writing.: He would not do it, and that
proposition was just what was wanted."
. Speaking of the threat to dismantle the
mills. President Shaffer said:
of me, 'Will you win out?' The Amalga
mated Association -will win out or it .will
cease to exist. We realize that wages- are
at stake and labor conditions are at issue.
If our organization dies I hope it will^not
have died in vain."
President Shaffer hurried to McKeesport.
from Newcastle and to-night addressed a
big mass-meeting at White's'Opera-house.
Shaffer was loudly cheered ' when he - ap
peared and the, meeting was very enthu
siastic. The strikers claim that as a re
sult of the meeting the National Tube, and
Rolling Mill men will strike. . -
Â¦ In the . course of his address President
Shaffer made the following statement:
The local leaders on either side did not
show much activity to-day. Secretary
Williams was the only Amalgamated rep
resentative who spent the entire day at
the strike headquarters. He said that the
office, would be closed this evening and
not reopened .until Monday morning. He
denied knowledge of any definite move
for peace, and declined to talk about the
situation. None of ,: the Amalgamated
leaders would discuss the conference with
President Gompers of the American,Fed
eration of Labor, but all who were ap
proached on the subject denied that there
had been any friction as to the part to
be finally played by the -federation. Pres
ident Corey of the Carnegie Company left
this afternoon for Homestead and the
other officials went home early. * Joseph
Schwab reached here, from New York
shortly after noon, but said that he was
merely here on a Sunday visit to his fam
ily. The steel officials denied knowledge
or any peace plan and said that they were
entering upon a winning fight. They said
that the Carnegie plants would lose no
men; that the reports of a general strike
at Wheeling were inaccurate, and that
many of their men would remain loyal
It was reportea that they had engaged
large numbers of non-union men who they
planned to rush into different works af
fected by the strike early next week, but
no confirmation of the statement was ob
tainable. ,-â¢...-;
Representatives of the strikers insisted
that the company was not in good faith
in the announcement, and that even if it
was it could not win with such methods.
Opponents of the strikers counted the
plan another victory, and declared that
the strike must "fail in the face of such
decisive action. ' : . , *:.Â¦

carried out, and the announcement from
the American ; Tin Plate Company created
a marked impression. . ~ â¢ - ;
American Federation of Labor returned
to-day from Pittsburgh where they were
in conference with President Shaffer and
others. Gompers declined to discuss the
strike situation or plans at this time. He
said that the statement* he cave out at
Pittsburg yesterday covered the ground
and that he had nothing- to add to it.
"I propose, to act, not talk," he said.
"The newspapers have threshed over this
strike matter too much already and I do
not propose to take any part in the dis
cussion in print. The newspapers can say
what they please. â¢ I have nothing what
ever to 'add to what I already have said.
I stand for industrial peace and will do

way, po both took separate turns in cross
questioning the ' witness. : Then Von' der

SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 10.â If John Win
ters is anything more than a mere ac
quaintance to her Miss Ida Spencer is the
cleverest little actress off the boards.
Many circumstances have come to light
that point to her as a sweetheart of the
confessed bullion thief. A week ago to
day a package valued at about $50 was
delivered at the Cosmopolitan Hotel In
this city addressed to Miss Ida Spencer.
George Woods, a driver of the San Ra
fael Express Company, took the parcel into
the hotel and delivered it to Mrs. Spen
cer, the girl's mother. Woods says that
at that time Mrs. Spencer said, "This Is
a wedding dress." any rate both
mother and daughter were very particu
lar and demanded that they be allowed
to examine the contents of the package
before receiving it. . Â¦
The express company next day secured
the desired permission from Hale Broth
ers, from whom the purchase was made,
and on the 5th Miss Spencer accepted the
package. To-night Miss Spencer denied
that Winters was anything more to her
than any other boarder who had staved
with them. She said: Â¦ ;

fhe employes keenly resent the Implica
tion that Tvas cast on all of them by the
robbery.
Constable Holies of Crockett, who was
one of the first to -work on the robbery,
â¢was interviewed yesterday at noon. In re
ply to questions he said:
"Winters has been taken to the city, but
we propose to bring him back. I do not
care what Lees may have said or prom
ised to Winters. This case was taken out
of our hands without any authority by
I-ees and Seymoijr. I have a Â¦warrant for
the arrest of Winters and I propose to go
over to San Francisco and bring him back
here. I have talked the matter over with
Sheriff \>ale. ar.d an information will be
filed against Winters before tha Grand
Jury cf tr.is county. I intend to see that
the lasw takes its course."
that he would secure a warrant for Win
ters and lock him up in the jail at Mar
tinez.
"This robbery was committed in this
county," said Vpale. "and we propose to
deal with the thlef^ If "Winters Is the
man, and I understand he is from what
Lees says. I will see that he is given a
trial here quickly. The evidence is all in

the law is not trifled with."
Conttmied From Page Thirteen.
When the tug had tied up to the wharf
a patrol wagon was called and the party
driven to the Hall of Justice. In the bot
tom of the wagon lay six sacks, each
containing from two to six bars of gold,
the whole aggregating a value of some
$120,000. The gold was placed on the floor
of Captain Seymour's office, Â¦where It was
tagged and notes of markings on the
bars made. An hour later the precious
metal was lying safely In the office of
the Selby Smelting Company on Mont
gomery street.
Winters Â¦was closeted with the detectives
for several hours. It was after 4 o'clock
when Captain Seymour announced that
Winters could be seen by the representa
tives of the press. Winters was in a
surly, vindictive mood, that found expres
sion In oaths and bitter rallingrs against
the newspapers. He charged that he had
been villainously abused and that many
lies had been published about him. He
refused to talk about the robbery of the
smelting works, nor- would he affirm or
deny the story that he was to receive
$25,000 and Immunity from prosecution for
making his confession to the police.
"Get out of here!" he snarled, savagely.
"If you don't go. I will. I don't want- to
talk to any of you." â¢ .
Captain Seymour denied positively that
It was nearly 10 o'clock yesterday morn
ing when the gold-laden tug Sea Witch
steamed up to the Vallejo street wharf.
In the party aboard were Captain of De
tectives Seymour. Superintendent Sayers
of the Pinkerton agency, ex-Chief of Po'
lice Lees, Detective Tom Gibson and the
prisoner. Winters was morose and sullen,
for on the trip he saw a copy of a morn-
Ing paper containing the picture of the
woman he loved and for whom he had
stolen the gold. He resented this as a
serious reflection upon the young woman
In question and the thought that she
might feel offended at the notoriety thrust
upon her seemed to worry him far more
than the knowledge of the predicament In
which he found himself.

be placed on trial and given his deserts."
OFFICERS HfiD WORKMEN WANT
Shortly after his arrival In the city
Detective Gibson was taken with a chill
as a result of his early morning bath and
he was forced to retire to his bed.
Captain Seymour praises all the detec
tives engaged in the capture of the crim
inal for their good work, but he Insists
that the credit of the capture rests with
the San Francisco detective force. As for
the reward of $25,000 offered by the Selby
people, the captain says he has no idea
how It Is to be divided. Speaking for him
self, he said he had no intention of claim-
Ing any part of it. although it was appa
rent that the confession was wrung from
Winters mainly through him. What dis
position will be made of the reward can
not now be determined.
He told of the task he had undertaken
and of the herculean labor that was his
before he had dumped the last of the
gold bars Into the waters of the bay near
the railway track. Fourteen trips were
required before the last of the heavy
bars, the whole Involving the carrying
of a half ton of metal and the trotting of
seven miles. Winters is a slight man and
not of apparent good health. How he
could find strength enough to carry some
of the sacks a distance of a quarter of a
mile is a matter of sumrise to the de
tectives, as some of them were heavy
enough to form a good load for two men.
This money he burled in. the hills near
his cabin, and since that time his fru
gality enabled him to increase his hoard
to $4300. When asked to disclose the'hid
ing place of his little store of wealth, he
laughed pleasantly and began to whistle
softly to himself. His manner was that
of a man who, crushed by the weight of
some great misfortune, and ashamed of
betraying emotion,, exhibits gayety in
order to mask the feelings which he seeks"
to conceal. He insisted that the. news
papers had betrayed him, but in what
manner he was unable to explain.
With the exception of admitting his
guilt and offering to steer the officers to
the place where the gold bars were rest
ing in their bed of mud. Winters proved to
be very reticent. He barely alluded to
his career In Texas, but said he came here
seven years ago from the Lone Star State
with $2700 In greenbacks.
Captain Seymour denied that he had a
quarrel with Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa
County relative to the custody of Winters.
That official was well satisfied to allow
Captain Seymour to retain charge of the
prisoner until Monday, when he (Veale)
will escort him across the bay.'
any hope of reward had been held out to
Winters in order to secure a confession of
guilt from him. "The evidence against
him was presented so forcibly to him that
he could not help confessing," said Cap
tain Seymour. "He realized that the game
was up and that his only chance of es
caping a long term was to make a confes
sion. While there was nothing said to
him about reward of a monetary charac
ter, it was intimated that the Selby peo
ple would be lenient with him 1Â£ he
showed them where the gold was hidden.
It is true the statements of Winters were
made with the understanding that they
would not be used against him. There is
enough evidence in my Judgment to con
vict him of the burglary. I am convinced
Winters will plead guilty when arraigned
for the crime. He will be sent to Crock
ett on Monday."
Almost at the same time It was unof
ficially announced that there - was a
chance that the plant of the "American
Steel Hoop Company at Warren, Ohio,
would be torn down and removed to some
community more favorable to the cor
poration. The order of yesterday direct
ing that the I>ewees Wood plant at Mo
Since the relations between tha American
Tin Plate Company and the workmen at
Monessen have been mutually satisfactory, in-
Euring steady and profitable operation. It has
been determined to more than double the plant
at that point, and some of the mills now Idle
on account of the strike, declared in viola
tion of the contracts signed by the Amalga
mated Association, will be dismantled and
moved to Monessen. Undoubtedly this will be
done In the case of works In which the senti
ment of the employes delays the resumption of
work. â¢ ' . â¢ -
A striking development of the day was
an official announcement from the Ameri
can Tin Plate Company to the effect that
certain plants of the company crippled by
the strike would be dismantled and re
movecr to Mone66en. The formal, an
nouncement, given by William Leeds after
a lengthy conference of the officials of the
company, follows:
The officers of the American Tin Plate
Company authorize the follow-in* statement:
The strikers held a series of demonstra
tions In the outlying towns and President
Shaffer spoke a final word of encourage
ment to his- Industrial troops. Great
throngs of workers turned out to greet
and cheer the leader and to maintain the
contest upon which thÂ»y have entered.
The policy of the American Federation
of Labor has not been fully disclosed yet,
and that fact contributes another element
of uncertainty to the situation. The ac
tion of the executive board of the Mine
Workers at Indianapolis to-day in resolv
ing to support the strike cheered the
Amalgamated men, ! and they are confi
dent that the Federation will aid them
to the fullest extent. The closing hourg
of labor lacked spectacular action. This
city, which is the strike center, was calm
and undisturbed. There was no. violence.
The police issued an order suspending
for the time being the vacation system.
They do not anticipate trouble, but want
to have every man here ready for duty
in case it should come. They say that
President Shaffer has counseled peaceful
methods, and that they hope the strikers
and their sympathisers will heed his ad
vice.
PITTSBURGH Aug. 10â The great steel
strike on the general order of President
Shaffer of the Amalgamated Association
became effective to-day, and thousands of
workers left their places - to return at
some indefinite time in the future, either
victorious over the ironmasters or in hum
ble defeat. The order to strike was gen
erally obeyed wherever the workers were
organized and enrolled in the lodges of
the Amalgamated Association, but "it will
be Monday before an accurate count can
be made of the men who have gone out.
A great majority of the mills close on Sat
urday and reopen Sunday night, and the
true test of the strength of the contend
ing sides will be furnished by the number
of men who return to work to-morrow or
Monday.

AD VEBTISEMENTS. 'SAN FRANCISCO.
For the visitors McLaughlin and Doyle
cJd the best work with -the- willow. Each
secured two safe hits, making four out of
the seven obtained by their team. Mc-
Gucken made a hard running ; catch of
Nordyke's long fly in the initial inning.
The Sacramentos. as a whole, played good
ball in the field, Devereaux making the
only misplay. : ""' .
Hoffer will pitch this afternoon for. Sac-'
rarcento. and a great game may be ex
pected, as he is considered a past master
at the art, as he played with the Balti
mores in the days when they were invinci
ble. .The official score of the game follows:
It was San Francisco's turn to hit and
ehout yesterday, both of which they did,
raucn to the discomfort of Thomas, who
lasted for an inning and a half, * and
Stricklett, who managed to cling on,
though the locals bombarded him with
force enough to unnerve any pitcher. Dur
ing the agony nine husky Germans com
pleted the circuit and 'eleven safe bumps
were secured Â«.ff Stricklett. Meanwhile
the Statesmen were able to score but one
run, though seven base hits were made
off the reliable lberg.
The Wasps took kindly to Thomas* de
livery in the first. They did not have to
hit, as Thomas either gave a base on balls
or else hit the batter. While the farce
v.-as being enacted Hildebrand and
Schwartz made the rounds and Pabst
stole third.
The Legislators made their only mark In
their half of the first. McLaughlin hit
for two cushions and trotted home on
Schwartz's wild throw to Pabst of Doyle's
grounder. After this the locals settled
down to work and not another Senator
crossed the plate. Though chances were
plentiful, sharp fielding did the work, and
"Brick" Devereaux with his followers
were forced to bow to the superior work
of their opponents. Seven, more runs
were piled up by Uncle Henry's men dur
ing the remainder of' the game â two in
the second, one in the third, one each in
the seventh and eighth and two in the
last round. Hitting the ball at opportune
times was responsible for this, as Sacra
mento made but one error.
Little Hildebrand played the game in
truly clever style. He hit safely three
times â one being a double â made three
runs and stole a base. He accepted five
chances In the field, bringing down th.e
applause of the stands twice on phenom
enal catches. Krug made two inexcusable
errors in the second and was sent out to
right field, Nordyke. relieving him at
short.

NEWPORT, R. I., Aug. 10.â Boat for
boat, the .amended Constitution beat the
Columbia to-day by four minutes and
nine seconds. It was a hard hammer to
windward and return "in an eight-knot
breeze. The new Herreshoff racer, in fine
form, did wonderfully well, but the result
was not altogether satisfactory as a test
of relative speed, because fifteen minutes
after the start the Columbia suffered a
mishap which cost her all of five minutes
in time, and, in the judgment of most
sood yachtsmen, the race. Her. bow
sprit shrouds were found to be
too long. As \T. the wind freshened
and she lay over at a big angle
the big stick which they supported
buckled dangerously, so that it was neces
sary to luff her Into the wind to take in
the slack of the stay.s. At the same tims
the steering gear was useless for some
minutes while she- was jumping on the
seas, and she yawed about almost-help
less. Repairs ' were made with remark
able skill and speed, and she was sent
away again, but well astern of- her rival,
for the, Constitution had passed her and
taken . a commanding position on the
weather bow of - the unfortunate boat.
The Constitution founded the outer mark
two minutes ahead, having gained In
elapsed time two minutes and fourteen
seconds in the flfteen-mile beat to wind
ward. 0 'Â¦'Â¦
On the run m, which was made with
spinnakers and balloon jibs, the new boat
came in like a racehorse and made a gain
of one minute and fifty-five seconds more
Both boats were handled admirably, and
barring the accident tfi the Columbia, it
was a grand race, at times bordering on
the sensational. . ' .â

'Whitney's, two-year-old colt Goldsmith
won the Saratoga special sweepstakes this
afternoon, defeating .the champion two
year-old filly Blue Girl by a short head.
The special Isa purely sporting sweep
stake for the owners of the eight horses
that went to the post, subscribing $1000
each, while those who had entered candi
dates for the race and declined the Issue
contributed. $500 each toward the stakes.
The association added only a $500 'silver
cup. ,
The start was an excellent one. Rossig
not, with Blue Girl at her saddle girth,
made the running down the backstretch,
with Goldsmith third. On the far turn
the order was the same, with Masterman,
who was last to leave the post, gradually
improving his position. The stretch
reached, the pace began to tell on Rossig
not, and both Blue Girl and: Goldsmith
passed her. A furlong from the wire Blue
Girl was a length in front, with Gold
smith closing on her at every stride. At
the lower end; of the grand stand Gold
smith swerved twice, but Turner quickly
straightened ;, him .-, out and he came on
again. A closa finish resulted, in which
Turner just squeezed Goldsmith home In

was third six lengths away. The total
value of the stake to Whitney was $15,500.

sixteen yrars. I have been sick for the last
three years, and have doctored a great deal
with different physicians, but all to- no pur-
pose. I have suffered a great deal from LIVER.
STOMACH and KIDNEY trouble. My stomach
would BLOAT UP after eating and PAIN ME
greatly. My food did not seem to do me any
good, and after I would eat a hearty meal I
would STILL BE HUNGRY. My condition
prew gradually worse, until the past year I
have been UNABLE TO WORK. I also grew
very NERVOUS and MELANCHOLY, and
was very WEAK AND RUN DOWN In every
way. This was my condition when I came to
Drs. Shores ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO. I can
say that Drs. Shores have helped me more in
the two weeks than ALL THE OTHER DOC-
TORS. MY STOMACH DOES NOT HURT MB
Â¦ANY MORE-AND I DIGEST MY FOOD. My
kidneys and liver, are much better, and my
nervous system is .also much Improved. 1

W.. WASHINGTON', Aug. 10.â Orders
awaiting the gunboat Machias at Hamp
ton Roads direct her to proceed with "all
dispatch to Colon, and preliminary in
structions have been given to the gunboat
Ranger, at San Diego, to hold herself in
readiness to proceed without delay to
Panama.
These were the Important developments
to-day in connection with the troubled
situation existing in Colombia and Vene
zuela. It had been the intention of the
2\avy Department to have a board of in
spection and euivey make an official in
spection of. the Machias at Hampton
Reads. This would have meant a delay of
at least two days, and she would probably
b ?Â£? had J to s P e nd another day in coaling.
The serious situation necessitates, in the
opinion or administration officials, the

will serve as a nucleus for a larger force

LONDON, Aug. 10.â "I am 'going to re
tire from the interviewing business per
manently," said United States Senator
Chauncey M. Depew to-day. "I have
served my full term and have generally
enjoyed it, but there have been so many
fictitious and erroneous reports of my
sayings and speeches since' I arrived in
Europe this summer that I have cpnclud
ed to give up the job. . ; Â¦ ...'"Â¦
"It is Impossible to discuss the great
strike Intelligently at this distance, but
the important thing to note is that the
prosperity of American manufacturers
and afirriculture continues in spite of
everything. The fact Is that American
prosperity is now so great that nothing
but a revolution can stop it, and nothing
can produce a revolution.
! "I have been seriously misquoted In an
American paper concerning the efforts, of
European governments to offset Ameri
can inroads into their trade and manu
factures. My observation of this move
ment leads to the conclusion that "while
the European . governments ) view with
alarm the increasing inroads of American
products, it is impossible that they should
successfully combine against them. .1 am
led to this conclusion by my railroad ex
perience. We often got a half dozen- or
more trunk line managers together who
agreed upon certain, rates, but when the
question of percentage was discussed it
was always found that their aggregate
demands reached 300 or 400 per cent. When
there was only 100 per cent to- divide.
There is no chance of European nations
ever agreeing upon a basis of division.
"I have not seen Croker, but he is. ap
parently getting much enjoyment of Eng
lish life.
"As a United States Senator I am pre
cluded from discussing Lord Kitchener's
proclamation,'. which undoubtedly was the
most important feature of English politics
this week. It is bound to create wide
spread comment, appearing as it does on
the day Lord Milner is returning to South
Africa. I presume Balfour and Chamber
lain will enlighten us on the subject at
Blenheim to-day, and it would have been
a. pleasure to me to hear them and wit
ness the demonstration at the Duke of
Marlborough's charming place had I not
thought that my presence there might be
misconstrued in the United States. It is
hopeless to expect European Intervention.
No matter how much the people sympa
thize with the heroic conduct of the Boers,
(governments are forced to determine ex
actly what effect intervention is going to
have for the Boers and where they them
selves stand when England declines their
demands." .
AGRICULTURAL SECRETARY
DISCUSSES CROP OUTLOOK
There Will Be an Abundance of Pota-
toes, Hay and Oats, and Wheat
Is Excellent.
TRAER? Iowa, Aug. 10.â Secretary Wil
son" of the Department of Agriculture has
.completed his tour of the corn belt and is
resting for a few days on his farm here.
"The weather of the future," said the
Secretary to-day, "will have much to do
with regard to the linal yield of corn and
final figures cannot be given by anybody
at the present time. Late corn will be
benefited by favorable fall weather, and
early corn, growing .under the best con
ditions, will fill out better with sufficient
rainfall in the near future. There has
been some injury, owing to the protracted
heat, to all corn fields, but much less
where rotation in crops has been ob
served than where the land Is perpetu
ally cultivated 'and crops are grown for
the purpose of selling the grain. "
"The oat crop is Kbundant. Wheat is
excellent everywhere. The hay crop Is
abundant. Northern and extreme West
ern States will have an abundance of po
tatoes to supply the States farther east,
where they have suffered. The sugar
beet is entirely > healthy everywhere and
has withstood the drought admirably.
"I have visited no locality where the
people need help from anybody. There is
an abundance of forage in the West to
winter all kinds of stock, and the damage
done to. the corn crop may result in man
agement in the future that will enable the
.farmer to avoid to a large extent a repe
tition of this year's experience."
CHICAGO, Atig. 10.â The packing firm of
Armour & Co. and Swift & Co." to-day be
came joint owners of the stockyards at

CLA.USE " TS ORGANIC ACT
VIRTUALLY INOPERATIVE
Circuit Judge Gear Renders a Decis-
ion of Great Importance to
. Honolulu Land-Holders.
' HONOLULU, Aug. 2.â Circuit Judge
Gear has rendered a decision under which
the clause in the organic act which pro
vides that no corporation In the Hawaiian
Islands shall held or acquire more thÂ£n
1000 acres of land is of no effect unless the
Territory shall take proceedings against
such corporations as may hold more than
the limit set in the act. The issue was
raised in the suit of J. B. Atherton against
the Wahiawa Sugar Company, the claim
being made that the plaintiff had no
standing in a court of equity in an action
to quiet title to a lease, for the reason
that he was the holder of more than 1000
acres of land as trustee for a corporation.
The court held that the allegation was
of- no consequence, having no bearing on
the case at issue. It was declared that
corporation titles to land exceeding 1000
acres were valid except against the Gov
ernment, which means that unless the
Government adopts the policy of proceed
ing against holders of large tracts of land
to prevent them from holding more than
the limit set forth in the organic act they
are cafe from the act's provisions.

The. Texas example comes latei/butit is none the less.timely. It will draw attention to. the
value- of timber lands and impress upon the public mind the importance of preserving the^forests
that remainTS^y and Jjy the people will be: wise enough to act through governmental authority
for, the protection' of the woods, but until that time comes it is good to have something done by
the corporations. â¢ Â¦'Â¦>f'>'i^-- " ; ' : Â¦'.- Â¦'.. Â¦*Â¦'.'â¢Â¦ .- \- \
This step toward the preservations of -the forest, it is .to be noted, has been taken not by
the State but.by a private corporation. It may be many years before Texas, through her Legis
lature; will be able to 'take so wise a step toward the . conservation of her woods, and accordingly,
it is a good thing that this particular timbered tract is in the hands of men who have business
sagacity and the energy and the pow,er to act upon 7 it^; â¢Â¦; . ' x v
Even in the hands of a .corporation it is a new thing to have that "much done in the way "
of preventing the wholesale^waste of /our woods. T
that degree of good sense shows what : has been accomplished by the persistent efforts; of the ad- â¢
vocates of forest preservation. ,In times past corporations have hot been so far r sighted. They
have wasted their timber as ruthlessly as .prodigal, heirs; waste their^ fortunes. Had all owners of
large timber^areas been as' thoughtful as are the i directors'qf the Houston Oil Company, they would
now have /been much richer than they are. : v - r . - -' '
FROM Texas ceres' the report that a large.area of timber land in that State has been leased
to a lumber company upon terms that will, conserve instead 'of > the forest. The
parties to the deal are; the Houston Oil Company, which owns the;land,'a tract of upward
of a million acres, and the Kirby, Lumber Company, ovhich is tocut the wood and 'manu
facture it into V merchantable lumber. By the terms of^hecofitract- the lumbermen are to cut no
tree that is less than, a foot in diameter, and care is Vto be. taken that saplings are not to be in^
jured. It. is; believed that by the enforcement of the terms, the value' of the forest will.' be. con- *
tinued indefinitely. ; ..'-
AN EXAMPLE FROM TEXAS.
This week the new tenor. Agoetinl. wttl
appear in the quaint old Donizetti opera
"La PSvortta." not heard here for some
ten years before this season. Ha is, of
coarse, cast as Ferdinand. The new
prima donna soprano, Linda Montanari, is
also to make her first appearnce this
week as Desdemona in Verdi's "Otello,'*
in which also we shall have Salassa at
his best as lago. Curiously enough.
"Otello" seems to have met with more
favor here than In any other city of its
production, mostly, indeed, through Salas
sa's fine lago. "We were to have had the
"Falstaff" also* last year, with Salassa In,
the title role, but ilt never came off.
though | It was rehearsed a number of \
times; and I fear me much will not mate- \
rialize this year either. Too bad; but the
"Meflstofele" is a certainty and "Andrea
Chenler'.' and "Fedora" the likeliest of
probabilities. = Z-
. Not since Gustav Hlnrichs* wife, Mrs.
Katherine Fleming Hlnrichs. sang the,
part of Azucena in "II Trovatore," some
four or five years ago. at the Tivoli, have
we had so good a gypsy as Collamarlnl
has given us this week. Vocally tho
singer is, of course, much more than Mrs.
Hinrlchs' equal, but she shows the saxaa
genius in her dramatic conception of thÂ«
part and the same self-sacrlflclntf excel
lence of make-up. Of the four roles in
which we have so far heard Collamarinlâ
Carmen, Amneris, MIgnon and Azucena*â
the last named comes nearest to her Car
men in* point of worth and is so far one; Y
of the roles of the season.
Slgnor Russo's Edgardo is another
notably good effort. ' He permits himself
here none of the liberties with the text*
or rather none of the interpolationsâ
"lazzi." as the Italians Indulgently tens
itâ for^whlch he Is somewhat notorious,
but gives a serious and almost dignified
rendering of the part. He la singing very
well this season and has gained more no
ticeably than any member of the company
during the year In poise and vocal round
ness and breadth. His voice seems to be
going the vocal way of dramatio tenors,
losing somewhat It3 lyric quality. Ha
may possibly be springing a Lohengrin
on us next year. 'â¢ .\ â¢
opera. Seppelli, Damrosch and Flon win
be the season's directors.
Rebellious Susan's lover consoles himself
In three weeks with another woman, and
she in turn consoles herself with | her
maimed Ideals and a husband i for - whom
she has lost all respect.
In "The Liars" the same smashing of
Idols and Ideals goes on, and all the plays
leave the same unwholesome taste In. the
mouth despite their undoubted brilliance
and genhis of technique. It is a view
"My boy," solemnly says . Sir Daniel,
after a long pause. "L. too, have suffered.
I loved your mother, ray lad, and had "to
give her up, but I met it as a man should,
and 60 you can."
Which would have been all very beauti
ful had not Sir Daniel just confessed to
Lady Eastney that he had tried to. per-
Euade the boy's mother to run away frora
her husband, and that but for an inop
portune illness of her son she would have
come to him. but hau vowed a vow that
if God would spare the child she would
give up her lover. And yet Sir Daniel so
thoroughly belie\ r es in his great sacrifice.
"You have never loved, it is easy to
talk," rails Sir Daniel's adopted son and
Mrs. Dane's lover, who has just been ad
vised of Mrs. Dane's past and of the con
sequent advisability of dropping her.
And that, I think, la Mr. Jones' position.
For the brave, beautiful, impossible
Â¦ thlngthat sometimes does happen he has
no ear, for the splendid foolishness that
la the one wisdom of a lifetime no voice.
He is the mouthpiece of the hopeless
mean, the deadly level, a master mechanic
of the commonplace, and sincere only In
his disbeliefs. He is at once the most tol
erant of men and the most cynical.'
Everything is reduced to absurdity. Even
Wb latest and greatest play, for "Mrs.
Dane's Defence" Is indeed a masterpiece,
he styles a comedy, and so it is if the
tragedy of a woman's honor has aught of
comedy about It. He has even sacrificed
bis wonderful sense of construction here
to his perverse passion for the reductlo
ad absurdum when he drags in a wholly
needless scene at the end to suggest Mrs.
Dane's lover's swift return to his former
love as soon as that errant lady's back
shall be turned. And with what quiet en
joyment he permits Sir Daliiel to disclose
the hollow-ness of the one great sacrifice
of his life I
"You may as well take these, for these
are all there are In the market, and they
are not at all bad when you get used to
them, take my word for it. True, Cupid's
nose is out of joint and Venus has lost
her arms, but a little plaster of parts and
they'll look as good as new, even if they
don't wear quite so welL Neither is
Diana all 6he should be, I own, but put
her in a dark corner and who'll be the
wiser? And this Golden Fleece only
needs touching up here and there to'de
ceive even an expert at a little distance,
while any one with a little ingenuity
could tack another wreath on Zeus' brow.
You want the genuine article? Well, I
haven't got It, and between you and me
I don't believe there is any such thing.
Good-day."
WHATEVER else Henry Arthur
Jones may be, and he is many
things that are brilliant and
fine, he Is never for one instant
the poet. Each play he pro
duces more clearly defines his lack of vis
ion, his limitation to the paths of the
purely commonplace, his boundary line of
the bread-and-butterism of life. Things
as they commonly are are Mr. Jones'
theme, sometimes even things uncommon,
but from the ordinary, standpoint, and
"herein he is undoubted master. For grasp
of the commonplace he is unequaled. He
has a "bead" on the middle of the road,
but he never lifts nor lowers his glance
to the heavens above or yawning hells be
neath him. His Is a gospel of the half
gods, the hymnal of a second hand Olym
pus, and he lays his battered deities at
our feet, saying something like this:
The Countess has a" brother, Count Fel
sen, whose part will be played by William
Bernard, a member pro tem. of the Neill
company. Mr. Bernard has lately arrived
here from Australia, after an eighteen
months* tour with Nance O'Neill in the
land of the kangaroo, and has much that
is interesting to tell of the fair Nance.
She has had a, wonderfully successful
tovfr, with such plays as '"Macbeth,".
"School for , Scandal," "Magda" and
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" In her repertoire,
and has also tried Ibsen on the natives.
They won'.t stand for "Hedda Gabler". at
all down there^Mr. Bernard tells me, and
as he came in time to see the Blanche
Bates "Hedda Gabler" here he was agree
ably surprised to see the size of the Ibsen
congregation' here. - Mr. * Bernard played
the part of George Tesman. I understand
the actor Is to play the leading heavies in
the new stock company that will shortly
begin operations i at the Grand' Opera
house! y *55H?8S
"The Royal Box," at the California
Theater, is also a pleasing novelty, the
drama being. largely played between one
of the boxes in the body of the house and
the elage. The leading character is one
James Clarence, a leading . actor of the
time, who has captured London. The
Countess Felsen is in love with him, and
he with her; also George, Princo of
"Wales. The Countess and the Prince ap
pear In the royal box together to witness
a performance of '"Romeo and Juliet," In
which Clarence is playing the__ leading
part, and the actor, realizing that ' this
means disgrace for the woman he loves,
publicly denounces the Prince - from tho
stage. Mr. Neill appears as James Clar
ence, Frank MacVicars as the Prince, and
Julia Dean as the Countess Felsen.
There are two distinct novelties Jn the
theatrical bill of the weekâ "The Royal
Box" at the California and Miss Char
lotte. Thompson's new play, "Silver
Mounted Harness," at the Alcazar. Miss
Thompson's play has been some time In
writing and a hopeful length of time In
rehearsal., and from . the .plot .promises
a good evening's entertainment. The
story is that of a woman who marries a
mart for a home and to free herself from
the quasi fast set in which her mother,
moves. She does not believe in love, hav
ing seen and heard it travestied and paro
died beyond recognition by her mother's
set, and thinks her admiration and re
spect for the man she marries a sufficient
basis for a happy marriage. She after
ward falls in love with a young lawyer,
a friend of her husband, and begins then
to find her. "silver-mounted _ harness" a'
gilded fetter, so to speak. A convenient
villain, also in love with the harnessed
â¢lady (Mrs. Latimer) ruins her husband
in order to get her in his power and then
offers to' save the husband if Â¦ the wife
will suffer his attentions. But the hus
band commits suicide rather- than face
the financial disgrace that he foresees,
thus leaving Mrs. Latimer in possession
of the silver mountings of the. harness,
that she probably melts into spoons when
she marries the young lawyer, who has
come in for the unearned Increment of

remarkable statements that certainly on

of the yellowest. of Journalism. Quite as
much, in fact, as did the first accounts
of the Roentgen ray wonders!
Mr. Hutchison's . instruments are* al
ready in use at the New York Institution
for the Deaf and in' many .other kindred
Institutions throughout the country. : For
eign institutions .have also taken advan
tage of ' the invention, and letters* of In
quiry from all parts of the civilized world
have been received by the Inventor. A
million dollar organization has taken up
the invention and is turning out the instru
ments as fast as possible,, but is as yet
unable to meet the demand. Applications
are received from all over from deaf suf
ferers, for every class and kind of deaf
ness. From the West Indies and South
America came in one day two typical in
quiries; from South America for a lady
38 years old who had lost her hearing aft
er she grew up. The West Indian case
was that of a. boy who had lost his> hear
ing through fright at the age of three:
For the lady, as she already "knew
sound ." one kind of instrument, "an op
era," wa3 recommended; for the boy, the
"teacher and pupil" instrument, through
which the patient Is' taught the meaning
of that which he hears right from the be-,
ginning. %-Â¦ \. . "
"It's wonderfully interesting to see how
they take It," says Mr. Hutchison. "Some
of them are simply thunderstruck at first.
Others cry. Oh, yes! Cry -the" way you
have seen people cry. with Joy. - Others
are like this fat man here (pointing to
one"of the picture?), simply in a rapture
of delight. Others faint. I studied medi
cine for a year so as to get a good 1 knowl
edge of the ear, and I bring the f alnters
around all right." ââ¢â¢Â»"â¢
The inventor has many photographs of
deaf people who for the first time in their
lives are hearing. Among these are some
pictures of deaf mutes at the New York
Institution for the Deaf listening to a
concert given for their benefit by Scotti,
Plancon, Suzanne, Adams and other sing
ers. : .. ' . ' -;> .' .
"The deaf person has a receiver of
â¢drying form, according to the degree of
his deafness. One style looks much like
the receivers worn by telephone girls. Let
a person with- normal ears put on one of
these receivers and sounds are intensified
to such a degree that the louder ones are
almost unbearable. A guitar, for ex
ample,' sounds almost like a pipe organ.
Music is not spoiled by the instrument."
AN invention apparently destined
completely to revolutionize the
education of the deaf Is one
just made by a young scientist
named Hutchison of New York.
The New York Sun of July 21 has a de
tailed account of Mr. Hutchison's mar
velous machine that reads like nothing so
much as a fairy tale. Men and women
deaf from birth are~ made to hear; those
who have become deaf through illness or
accident have their hearing restored, and
the stories r of their experiences are full
both of pathos and humor.
The principle of the invention is a sim
ple intensifying of the volume of sound
by? means of electrical intruments some
what on the order of the telephone. No
less than seventeen different kinds of in
struments have been perfected by the in
ventor, ranging from one that can^be used
by one person at a dinner party or opera
to one that is designed for the simultane
ous use of a teacher and a half-dozen pu
pils. Not only ha3 Mr. Hutchison proved
that his instruments can make the deaf
hear, but that their use has a tendency
to increase the actual hearing power of
the sufferers. On the ordinary ear the
effect, as Mr. Hutchison proves in his own
case, is simply to make the hearing rather
more normally acute, though on the sur
face it would appear it should be other
wise. Says Mr. Hutchison:
THE TTVOLI'g NEW STAR

These are the sources of good breeding/ and there are no others., No pedigree is re
quired. The means are possessed by all. In the homes of the blessed and transfigured and glo
rified mothers who baked. beans and made apple pies, there were better manners and better
â¢breeding than in the palace of a Duke, because they sprang from this natural" source and were
not affected and artificial. Heaven bless the rusticity from which we "sprang. It is the patent of
American nobility, and the world's best genius in every land has sprung from its loins. The child
nurtured on the lap of those "rustic" mothers, is now, as ever, the world's hope. His lineage is
more ancient than any Duke's, and his ancestry furnished heroes and made history when royalty
was a sapling. Compared to him the caste of Vere de'Vere is junior, artificial, excrescent. Over
the lintel of the American home is written the legend ~cf the Laureate: ' "Kind hearts are more
than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood/' j r' _.-:.â¢â¢
There, brethren and sisters, you are. You can't act like a strain of music because your
mother baked beans and made apple pies! It does not seem to occur to these folks who feel so
painfully their social inferiority- while " lunching \with the Hon.- Mrs. This 'or That,, that goodi
breeding, asrvve call the method of social intercourse, has a common source, which is subject to"
the use of all, gentle and simple. It is genuine kindness of heart, sincere 1 regard /for the rights
and feelings of others, and a generous measure of self-effacement, by transformation. of selfishness \
into an unaffected interest in the pleasure and welfare of those with whom we are associated.
. Poor Carnegie, poor America;; too young to have good manners and social form! The lady
does not unkindly leave us in the dark as to what is the matter with our. manners. It is a sin of .
Â¦ our^ parents that is to stick iÂ« our bark to the tenth generation. She says our trouble - is that:/
"We Americans, without exception, spring from more or less, rusticity./ Most of our motriers'/
baked their own beans and made their own apple pies. My father was a man -of wealth 'arid I:
leisure and my mother a very beautiful . and elegant woman; but when a person like Hon. Mrs!^
Wdlesley comes to lunch we cannot escape the ; consciousness of her superiority. Sucfrwomen v
never speak nor act amiss. Whether they eat or drink, or whatsoeyer they do, they do all beau- ;
tifully. Their conduct suggests a strain of music." . " '
THE ancestry of a people, the kind of folk from whom they sprang, is:a subject' of interest / Â¦
always to the student-of man and history. -J , '
!;, It has been believed that Americans have no need to blush at a comparison of their
forebears with those of any other Â¦ Â¦country." We have our, individualities, our" peculiar!- ;
ties, if you please, and so have the people of : other nations These are more or less- an expres
sion of our national . character, which is the aggregate of individual characteV. The most of
us are content with that expression' in our case, and have no desire to exchange it for the char-:'
acteristics of others. But there "are some among us to whom that expression" is so offensive that %
they desire i to efface it altogether, and with it to wipe put their distinct: Americanism and assim- ' ;
ilatf something else which they regard as superior. Mrs. Sherwood, an American: woman, has
| become a student of our social imperfections, and blushes for them. ; She declares that "we can
; not compare with our English kindred for perfection of social deportment..'' The nobility and
aristocracy of Great Britain have behind .them the education, culture and good form of centu
ries. Their ancestors' elegancies come down to them as do their ancestral estates. Think what
it means -to be born in. such a storehouse of luxury as home of the Duchess of Sutherland.;
One so born begins life under tlie most beautiful and~ tasteful of auspices, unequaled in any palace
in the United States. America produces giants of practical mentality, industrial and commer
; cial Napoleons, but it is yet too young to produce men like the Duke of Sutherland, who is the
; epitome of. the grace and elegance of a thousand years. Carnegie can pile "up, millions and dis
pense, them with a prodigality unknown before, but the uttermost heights "of social culture "lies
quite beyond him." ' 4 . * â¢
JOHN WINTERS, arrested for :ihe. robbery ,of the \Selt>y Smelting Works, has con
fessed the crime and Has, pointed out where the stolen bullion was hidden. It is now re
ported that he made the confession%under a promise that he would not be severely punished
and would receive a reward: The exact nature of the means used to obtain a confession may
be known only to the parties concerned in the agreement, but if the reports be true therehas been
committed in this case a second offense against the law; and the second is not less menacing to
society than the first. " Â¦
It is a necessity to civilized communities that criminals be not permitted to escape im
whipped of justice, and accordingly statutes have been enacted against compounding crimes. The
statute of California on the subject' says: "Every person who, having knowledge of the actual
commission of a crime, takes money or property of another, or any gratuity or reward, of any
engagement or promise thereof, upon any agreement or; understanding to, compound or conceal
-such a crime, or to abstain from any prosecution thereof/ or to withhold any evidence thereof, ex
cept in the cases provided for b* law in which crimes may be compromised by leave of the court,
is punishable as follows." The statute then sets forth the. various degrees of punishment pro
vided in proportion to the magnitude of the crime compounded. . v.*>
In this case as Winters has~not been held before any court there has been no possibility
of compromising his offense by "leave of the/court/' Thus if the reports be true there x appears a
clear case of the violation of the statute. \ Â¦' <
â¢The officers of the law should not*p>errnit a matter of this grave importance to pass over
without investigation. If. the crime of Winters has ; been compounded, if he is to go witlr a nom
inal sentence, with or without reward, the men who grant him that freedom should be prosecuted
in his place/ " - â¢ ' . '.â¢'." \
Compounding crime is the most dangerous of all forms of encouraging crime. ..The crim
inal who escapes justice is almost sure to commit 'other crimes. That '"the Selby Company may
gain much by agreeing to let Winters . go free may be concecfed, but they have no right
r to make that profit for themselves by turning loose upon society ;a confessed -robber 'Winters
has not violated a law of the Selby Company, but a Jaw of California, and to that law.' is. answer
able/ The rights of the community are at stake in this matter, and it isHhe duty of the authorities
to see to" it that the law isVnforced. r '-Â¦' Â¦ -'' * â¢ . '

The officers and parish representatives
In the diocese of California are:
Officers and Representatives.
The prospect of a great attendance of
churchwomea in October is regarded by
tbe local officers as assured.. An Immense
amount of missionary enthusiasm has
been created among the members, and the
help which the society has given to the
bishops has contributed greatly to the ex
tension of the church in distant lands.
Without the assistance of the auxiliary
the missionary work of the whole church
would have been greatly hampered.
The Â¦Woman's Auxiliary to the Board of
Missions of the Episcopal church In the
United States will meetjn this city dur
ing the Triennial Convention to b* held in
October next. The auxiliary has branches
In every diocese and represents a ma
jority of the constituted parishes. Its
purpose is to help the missions by contri
butions of money or goods. At the con
vention In 189S it reported contributions of
over JS50.000 for the three years previous,
and at the ceneral meeting held in Wash
ington one contribution of $80,000 was of
fered. Efforts will be made to increase
even this magnificent figure at the general
services.

"All that now remains to be done," said
Chief Hazen, "is to recover the $30,000.
We do not believe that it has been spent.
Dimmick was too clever and wary 'Â¦ to
gamble to any noticeable extent and while
there are rumors he was mixed up
with two or three women, there isno/ie
that he. expended much money on them."
Chief /Hazen will keep Dimmick in cus
tody until Monday, when he will be
turned over to the United States Marshal
and taken . before Court Commissioner
Heacock for arraignment. The Chief pub
licly complimented Mr. Burns for the
valuable assistance he had rendered in the
case. - . ;. ;
United States Attorney Woodworth ex
pressed confidence that the case against
Dimmick was as strong as could be de
sired. If It had not been so strong, he
said,, he would not have drawn up the
complaints.
The speaker added that there were two
very substantial reasons why the prisoner
had not been arrested before. One of
those reasons was that all the evidence
had not been secured until a day or two
before the arrest, and the other reason
Mr. Burns preferred to keep locked In his
own bosom.
"Dimmick covered up his tracks very
well," continued Agent Burns, "for the
money was removed from the vault in in
stallments, but he overreached himself
In his cunning. I never saw a thief yet
that didn't leave a track behind him."
Thinks Money Has Not Been Spent.
The Secret Service men and Mr. Wood
worth had another protracted consultation
from 2 until after 3 p. m., at the end of
which Secret Service Agent Burns made
a statement to the representatives ofahe
press to ihe effect that the matter was
now in the hands of the .Department of
Justice, and that they had. nothing to give
out except that they had secured sufficient
evidence to warrant the I conviction of
Dimmick on all the charges. Mr. Burn3
was sent from Washington, D. G., about
three weeks ago to assist Chief Hazen in
unearthing the criminal. He said there
was great surprise in the "Secret Service
Department when it was learned that the
local Mint authorities had been investi
gating the- shortage for at least four days
before the * Secret Service people had been
notified. He was at a loss to account ra
tionally for such shiftlessiWss on the part
of the Mint peoole.^ â Â¦'
Mr. Burns was frank in admitting that
no part of the stolen $30,000 had been re
covered, and he was equally frank in
stating that the guilt of Dimmick would
be proven beyond a doubt. He denied the
reports that Dimmick had made a confes
sion and declared that Dimmick con
tinued to protest that he was innocent.
The evidence against Dimmick was con
clusive, he said:
Burns Gives " Out "Statement.
Dimmick was arrested late last Friday
night in the Union League Club by Se
cret Service Agents W. J. Burns and
George W. Hazen and was kept by them
under surveillance , in a. hotel. United
States" Attorney Woodworth and the
agents had a consultation with Commis
sioner Heacpck yesterday morning and de
cided that the bonds : of the prisoner
should be fixed at $30,000 on one complaint,
$5000 on another and $1000 on each of the
two remaining complaints, making'a total
of<"$37,000. It was intended. that the pris
oner should be brought before"?Commis
sioner Heacock at noon for the purpose
of being properly^ identified and of hav
ing a date set for the preliminary exam
ination but after the Commissioner had
waited half, an hour after noon and the
prisoner and his captors had not ap
peared. Judge Heacock adjourned court
and went home. -. - - .
. The United States Secret Service agents
and United States Attorney "Woodworth
announced yesterday that they had a
strong case against Walter N. Dimmick,
the chief clerk of the Mint, who must
stand trial In, the United States District
Court for the embezzlement of $32,700.
Confident That They Will Se
cure a Conviction in
the Case. .

The following statement was handed in
by Mr. Chambers of the Santa Fe Com
pany, showing how much oil the company
had shipped into San Francisco from Ba
kersfield for the first six months of 1901:
January, 7 cars. 42.333 gallons; March. 53
cars, 326,450 gallons; April, 88 cars. 532.972
gallons; May, 107 cars. C46.476 gallons:
June. 74 cars. 451.2CS gallonsâ being a total
of 1,999,509 gallons.
"No railroad can hope to do only a first
class business. We would not make the
rates so low if we could not use the re
turn cars loaded."
Railroad* Commissioners Laumeister.
Edson and Blackstock heard the last of
the testimony in the oil rate investigation
yesterday, and arguments will be heard
by the Commissioners on September 3.
Mr. Sproule was the last witness to be
examined. He was questioned carefully
by Mr. Short, and then Mr. Herrin took
the witness in hand. Between them they
made Mr. Sproule answer a multitude of
questions.
Mr. Short wanted to know if an agree
ment existed between the Southern Pacific
end the Santa Fe railroads regarding the
use of the spur track that enters the
Kern River oil district. The witness said
he had no knowledge of such an agree
ment. He admitted, however, that there
was an arrangement by which a nominal
sum was charged the Santa Fe people for
the use of the spur. He thought it was
about one cent per barrel for the Jbil taken
off the .spur. This oil. the witness said,
was for the Santa Fe's own use. otherwise
the company would be charged' the same
rate as is charged consignees. He said
the Standard Oil Company paid the same
rate as any one else, and that there are
no favored parties on the spur. _
Mr. Herrin examined the witness about
the making of rates. Mr. Sproule gave a
long explanation. In which he said in part:
"Tariffs are formulated by mutual
agreements with Eastern lines, and rates
Â¦were so made that Western goods could
find a market in the Easi and a rate was
made West so that Eastern products
could be marketed. If the Southern Pa
cific refused to take a 75-cent rate upon
fteel goods the result would be that the
connecting lines would refuse a reason
able rate for our commodities. The 50
cent rate on some of our products is so
low that our connecting lines refuse to
handle them. This commodity goes by
the Southern Pacific ships, by the gulf
route â that is, to Algiers and then on to
New York by the Morgan line of steam
ers. The Southern Pacific Company car
ries this commodity at the 50-cent rate be
cause if it did not do so this business
Â¦would be given to ships, and the Southern
Pacific would lose business of a better
class by declining to carry business of a
low class.
"It is apparent that adequate relief Is
not within the hands of plaintiff. The
means of identification are not perfect.
If they were defendant would not sell
these tickets. â¢ â¢ * The relief at law is
not adequate, for its remedy at law for
breach of contract consists of a suit for
damages against the original purchaser
or the substituted holder; but suits
against the purchasers would necessarily
be separate and numerous." # . .
In his opinion Judge Murasky does not
pass upon the merits of the point raised
in connection with the Sherman act, ex
cept to say that the mere fact that a
party ' to a contract happens to be a
member of an illegal trust does
not operate to vitiate a contract between
the party to an illegal trust and a third
party. Continuing, the court says:
Duffin filed formal answer, in w.hich he
denied that he had been dealing in scalped
tickets or intended to do so. Then on the
hearing .his counsel contended thaf the
Southern Pacific Company was not en
titled to relief, as it had come into court
with unclean hands, in that it had vio
lated the Sherman act by entering into a
combination with other railroad com
panies to fix the Ep worth League rate.
A judgment rendered yesterday by Su
perior Judge Murasky leaves the local
ticket : scalpers without" an occupation.
Judgre Murasky refused to dissolve the in
junction heretofore issued . restraining the
scalpers fr*om dealing in Epwprth League
and other tickets. This decision leaves
the scalpers without further remedy, un
less upon appeal to the Supreme Court
the judgment is reversed,
Action was filed by the Soutnern Pacific
Company to restrain the scalpers.- Scalp
ers Conklin and Duffin joined issues and
moved to dissolve the injunction, each ad
vancing on a different line of action.
Conklm admitted that he was scalping"
tickets, but contended that his business
was legitimate. He held that the* South
ern Pacific. Company Â¦was not entitled to
equitable relief, as a remedy at law was
in its hands.
The legislators who read the pamphlet
undoubtedly expected when they voted
that the State v/ould get 5000 acres for its
money, and they have been surprised' to
find that the plan is to ' charge a : price
that will give the State only one-half of
the promised, tract.
Â¦ Andrew- P. Hill, who was very active
at Sacramento fh urging the passage of
'the Big Basin park bill, says' that when
Mr. Reed issued his statement* that was
made a part of the Sempervirens pamph
let, an option on the land had already
been secured from the owners at the rate
of $100 per acre, and that Mr. Reed knew
that to be the fact. Mr. Hill says that
the conversations that he had with Mr.
Â«Reed "on that very point left no doubt that
Mr. Reed understood the facts. Mr. Reed
said, however, that he would make the
owners take less than $100 per acre.
Mrs. Walters says that after she had
prepared the. pamphlet to be presented to
the Legislature to influence the members
of that body to move to save the Big
Basin? forest- from destruction Charles
Wesley Reed dropped out two pages of
the original matter and inserted the state
ments "^concerning the price for the land
to be acquired by the State. She says
there .was no such . statement when she
completed her work.
Mrs. Walters, secretary of the club, and
Andrew P. Hill, who has more actively
and energetically promoted the' club's in
terest than has any other person, told the
story to a Call reporter who went to the
camp in the tasin, expecting that the
Redwood Park. Commission would be
there. It will be x recalled that an extract
from a pamphlet -Issued by the club and
published in The Call contained the state
ment, over Reed's signature, that $500,000
would buy 14,000 acres in the Big Basin,
and that $250,000 would be sufficient to ac
quire 5000 acres. Now the fact having been
originally made known through The Call
that the price placed upon the property
by the lumbermen is $100 per acre, and
there being a seeming inconsitency in, the
attitude of the club in that matter,. Mrs.
Walters and Mr. Hill have" hastened to
justify the club. â¢
The members of the Sempervirens Club,
now encamped in the Big Basin, in Santa
Cruz County, *say that Attorney 'Charles
"Wesley Reed was responsible for telling
the Legislature that $250,000 would buy
5000 acres of land in the basin, and that if
the legislators were of opinion that the
State would secure this amount of forest
it was not due to the club, but to Reed.

Mataafa to the throne of Samoa. After
the Germans took possession ot their part

and left for Tonga. Fiji Islands. Natives

The report of Captain Wilhelm of the
regular army .'on the condition of Camp

that in viewing the citizen soldiery the

Forty-first District.
There was a large attendance last even
ing , at the meeting of the Forty
first * Assembly District Republican
Primary League, ajid the keynote
of the gathering 1 was success, sure
and sweeping 1 , for the anti-bosa Re
publicans. Colonel John C. Currier, who
presided In the absence of Horace Davis,
spoke of the primary election as some
thing which had been sadly neglected In
the past by the better class of citizens.
The primary election, he said, was thÂ»
very foundation of the government, and
it was in taking advantage of their real
ization of this that the bosses had se
cured their grip on municipal affairs.
This year, however, it was going: to be
different. The registration among busi
ness men had been unusually large, the
district had been strongly canvassed and
everything pointed to a clean primary,
which for once would represent the voice
of the people. Attorney Pratt, William
Sexton, Maurice Brandt. F. C. Selfridge,
E. J. Casey and others addressed the
meeting, .which adjourned early for the
reason expressed by all the speakers that
work would count more than oratory and
there was still a field in the district for
the missionary of anti-bossism. Atten
tion was called to the fact that Tuesday
next was collection day as well as elec
tion day, and business men residing in the
Forty-nrst were advised to vote In the
morning, before going to their offices,
where the extra work of the day might
detain them, until after the polls had
closed.
Reader, can you ' trust these gentlemen with
your interests? If possible, secure the tickets
of our opponents, both of which the bosses have
created to deceive you, scan them closely and
after falling to find the names of any of la
bor's friends printed on either, reflect and con
sider this matter fully, then go to the polls on
Tuesday next and with your vote assist to an
nihilate this vile and malicious slander. Officers

The Republican political bosses realizing their
utter deteat in . the - Thirty-seventh Assembly
District, at the coming primary election, have
resorted to a last foul and vicious manner of
winning votes, namely: ralsenood and deceit.
For the past few days a number of their un
scrupulous lambs have been circulating a re
port that the Primary League ticket In this dis

thereby to deceive the honest voter. In contra

Primary League or Anti-boss ticket..

Notice to Honest Voters.
! BERLIN, Aug. 10.â All eyes in Germany
are.,turned to-day on Cronberg. -Public
Interest in the deceased Dowager Em
press during her widowhood has been
slight, as she did everything possible to
retire from public view and avoided every
semblance of political activity.. The lat
ter fact has softened the judgment | of
even the unbending Junker organs, who
once persecuted her Majesty, assailing
ner most sharply when at the very acme
ot power. The Dowager Empress" death
reveals the' fact -that the autocratic ex
tremists had largely modified their judg
â¢ or }.' en at Jeast had ignored their points
of differences. They praise her. for her
humanity, her tender nursing of the sick
in war, her interest in industrial art and
the. practical advance she made in these
lines. .They also praise her activity in
promoting female education and in the
advance of. women'. The most conserva
tive papers praise $ the latter feature of
her character unstintedly. ,The news
papers comments partake largely 'of
reminiscences, pointing out that. the de
ceased was one of the last links binding
the Germany of to-day with the great
historical events of thirty years ago.
While the nation has thus been engaged
m. recounting the story ot the life of the
Dowager Empress her -.relatives have
been assembling at Cronberg for the fun
eral. King Edward and Queen Alexandra,
arrived there to-day and Prince Henry
Â°Â£ Prussia . who is now steaming up the
channel, is expected to arrive at Bremer
haven Sunday or Monday, too late for the
services at Cronberg, but in time to at
tend the burial at Potsdam. ; -
Large Cro-wds Arriving at Cronberg,
Great crowds of curious people are ar
riving at Cronberg. All the hotels there
are overflowing and all the windows are
engaged for them. Cronberg is overrun
with English people in deep mourning.
King Edward, with Queen Alexandra,
will go to Potsdam. Then his Majesty
will return to Homburg alone, "where he
will take the waters, living at his accus
tomed hotel in the same style as when
he was Prince of Wales. .
The coffin of the deceased Dowager Em
press, which has been sent- from Berlin
to Cronberg. is of the English' style, with
a flat cover; not the German pyramidal
style. The deceased herself designed; the
rosettes ornamenting the cover and also
designed the coffin. The train which is to
bring the funeral party to Potsdam-has
been prepared at Frankfort. The car
which will carry the coffin is trimmed'
with English mourning colors, lilac and
white, and is richly ornamented within
and without. Other cars have been pro
vided for the fune.ral narty.
The Emperor has Jeen busy as usual
with the affairs of state. He worked at
his office nearly all day, and then late In
the evening took a walk in the park with
Count von Bulow.
Papers of various shades of opinion give
expression to the complaints or theatrical
people and musicians at the orders issued
for the closing of theaters until the fu
neral is over, and print letters "To the!
Editor" mildly remonstrating.
Friends Welcome Von Waldersee.
While Field Marshal Count von Wal-
There are unusual numbers of Ameri
cans visiting Berlin. All the hotels are
crowded with them. . It Is impossible to
secure tickets ion the German steamers
before October. Â¦
Suderman, who is recuperating in the
Engadine Valley (Switzerland) has nearly
finished a new play.
The Emperor has ordered a change in
the arrangements of all launchings where
he participates, furnishing himself a
sketch showing how the lines of soldiers
must be drawn up within the ship yards
while he is present.
The week's tariff discussion took largely
the form of a sharp attack on the part of
the Agrarians and Conservative organs
upon a semi-official news agency for the
continued publication in the foreign press
of attacks upon the bill. Some of the
bolder papers go to the length of openly
attacking the Foreign Office as being re
sponsible, since all the political dispatches
are censored there before publication in
sinuating that Count von Bulow is Insin
cere in his tariff bill attitude and is now
trying to kill it.
The United States continues to play an
important role in the tariff discussions.
The Kreuz Zeitung to-day quotes ap
provingly the declaration of the Chamber
of Commerce of Eupen (Rhenish Prussia)
that Germany must expect to be flooded
with American goods. . The Kreuz Zeitune
adds that the domestic industry is threat
ened by keener foreign competition -and
especially American, adding:
"The greater the danger the more urg
ent and inexorable the demand that the
home market be surrounded with firm
protection. The United States Itself pre
cedes us In this respect with an example
impossible to misunderstand." â¢
Attacks Upon the Tariff Bill.
While the train waited Von Waldersee
entertained them with- his China expe
riences, which called forth roars of laugh
ter. The field marshal will dine with Em
peror William at the, Homburg Schloss
to-day. He will return to Hanover to
morrow. It is understood that Von Wal
dersee's reappointment as inspector of
the Third Army Corps is In accordance
with an arrangement with his Majesty
prior to the field marshal's departure for
China-
dersee's arrival in Germany was natural
ly overshadowed by . the sad event at
Cronberg, the whole tone of the press and
the attitude of the crowds during Count
von Waldersee's trip yesterday from
Hamburg to Hanover indicated that Ger
many takes a much more sober view of
von Waldersee's mission now than was
the case a year ago. '.The more influen
tial papers regard the field marshal's
work appreciably, but imply- that every
body in Germany has formed exagger
ated notions of the i task before him.
Count von Waldersee is described as deep
ly bronzed. Yesterday at Kaisset his old
military friends welcomed him on his way
to Homburg-.
The statutes of most States where there
has: been legislation on this subject use
the words "religious purposes," but un
der the Â¦ constitutional provision in this
State the words "religious worship" are
used. "And not only must the buildings
and real estate be used exclusively for
religious worship," says the Attorney Gen
eral, "but' they must be used solely for
such religious worship. There would seem
to be no doubt," he adds, "that a church
building or property which is rented for
lectures and concerts is not used solely
and exclusively for religious- worship." It
is therefore decided that church property
when so rented is. not exempt.
The 'Attorney General was also asked
by the Board of Equalizers if there was
any authority for examining persons in
regard to church property. It is held by
the Attorney, General that such state
ments as are deemed necessary may be
exacted.
The Attorney General then cites various
authorities to prove tbat because certain
portions of the property. ara used exclu
sively for religious purnpses it does not
follow that . other portions not- so used
shall have equai immunity from taxation
It is also shown that even though pro
ceeds from rentals may be nsed for re
ligious purposes the fact does not legally
warrant exemption.
All buildings and so much of the real prop
erty upon which Â¦ they Â¦ are situated as may
be required for the convenient use and occu
pation of | said buildings, when the same are
used solely and exclusively for religious wor
ship, shall be / ree from taxation; provided that
no buildings s'o used which may be rented for
religious purposes, and the rent received by the
owners thereof, shall be exempt from taxa
tion. â¢
In answer to a' communication from the
State Board of 'Equalizers requesting in
formation as to whether church property
should be taxed when 'portions of it are
rented or, otherwise used as a source. of
revenue, the Attorney General rendered
an affirmative opinion yesterday.
,The State constitution in respect to this
matter reads as follows: -
Attorney General Renders
an Opinion of Great
Interest.
Relatives Are Now Gathering
at Crbnberg to Attend
Â¦ the Funeral.: .

From basement to garret during the
past seven months workmen have been
transforming . the old-fashioned furnish
ings into the most modern equipped hotel
of the coast. Over $70,000 has been.ex
pended, and that it has been wisely done
Is evidenced by the comfort, taste and
convenience seen at every turn. Perhaps
the most conspicuous feature in the
change is the magnificent new entrance
on Montgomery street, constructed almost
entirely .of marble. A broad flight of
steps ascends to a landing midway'be
tween the first and second floor, whence
the flight continues at right angles to the
office. . Heavy brass fittings of balustrade
and chandelier heighten the effect of
massiveness and contrast pleasurably
with the rich mahogany of " .which the
woodwork is constructed. The I business
office' has been completely remodeled and
is one of the nandsomest in the city, - be
ing finished in well selected â¢ mahogany.'
Throughout the hotel entirely new sani
tary plumbing has been installed and hot
and cold water introduced into each of the
300 rooms. Twenty-one new baths have
been added % to the suites not previously
supplied. An electric service has been es
tablished, as well as gas provided in event
of electricity falling. The dining-room and
kitchen have been remodeled and supplied
with 'the latest apparatus known in the
conduct of a modern hotel. It may be
mentioned in. this connection that the cui
sine of the Russ House has been one of
the features that has gained for It great
popularity, not alone among the traveling;
public,' but with San Franciscans as well/
The lunch especially has been well pa
tronized by downtown business men, and
with the Increased facilities for handling
expeditiously a large number of patrons
should surpass its previous popularity. '
Colonel J. S.Young. the proprietor, has
been - in . the hotel business for the past
thirty-five years, and his career has been
one of uninterrupted success. No one un
derstands or is . quicker ; to anticipate the
demands of the public, and no. hotel pro

Twelve of the fourteen civil service dep

Collector's office were sworn in yesterday
after filing bonds in the sum of $5000 each.
Hiram Goldstein and Charles Squires, the
two other ellgibles, are out of the State,
but their, places will be reserved for them
when they return.
Â¦ Mayor Phelan withdrew . his protest
against the payment of Scott's old depu
ties, who have been resisting civil service
and whose salary demands for four
months were not approved by the Aud
itor. Each deputy received $500.
. Superintendent of Public Buildings Bar
nett is in danger of losing his position if
the Civil Service Commission follows its
rule providing that any applicant failing in
one ' examination ' is barred from taking
another for a r>erlod of six months. Bar
nett received only 70 per cent in the ex
amination which was held one month ago,
75 per cent beinjr the minimum.
The commission has decided to hold the
remaining examinations .for all positions
under the civil service in the city govern-:
ment before the end of the year. -This
will bring, the second examination for Su
perintendent of Public Buildings within
the six months' limit,": and Barnett , will
consequently follow in the footsteps of
Superintendent of Streets Thomas, who
also failed in the examination, and will
be succeeded by one of the three ellgibles
who passed.

BREAKFASTS
EASY FOR THE COOK.
As the warm days approach, it is well
to give some thought to an easy way to
prepare breakfast. A food that is already
cooked and simply needs to be treated
with a little cold milk or cold cream 13
Ideal on that point, and such a food can
be found in Grape-Nuts, at 15 cents per
package.
It is sold by all grocers, and is so highly
concentrated that not more than three or
four teaspoonfuls are required for the
cereal part of the meal. This makes the
food very economical and does not over-
tax the stomach with a great- volume.

y There is no such condition as weakness in a man under fifty years of age, 35
fed other than general, debility. In a stomach damaged by an ulcer or inflamma.' jg
ES* tion, symptoms of disorGered function arise. Prematureness, loss of vitality H
S3! and the disorders known as '.'weakness" are but symptoms of some damage to j B
E the reproductive system, caused by a contracted disorder or early dissipa- Q
E3 tion. In looking for the location of this damage we generally find an en- ~
BS larged, swollen and inflammed prostate gland. As this gland Is the very cen- : ma
SI ter of the reproductive system, it can readily be understood that Inflamma- j
H tion of it must cause disordered function. These cases are promptly benefited Â»j
B by proper treatment, otherwise the patient goes. from bad to worse. The es- jg
B sential point in all of them is the necessity of the cure of the focus of the Â»g
H trouble, in the prostate. Many men have unsuccessfully treated for a weak- (j
H .ness which never existed, when if the damaged tract had been repaired a, 'Â¦
8 cure would have been the result. In our experience there is no drug in the Â¦
Â¦j Pharmacopeia, taken into the stomach, that will even benefit this class of Â¦
H cases. Our plan of treatment is entirely a local one and prompt results are HI
S obtained, as indicated by increased circulation and return of natural vigor. Â¦
El Varicocele is an enlargement of the most vital blood vessels in man. In 88
EB their normar condition, their function' is to carry oft waste material, thus R
H enabling the organs to receive fresh nutrition. Owing to the breaking down B

of the pavilion. In the afternoon the
place had the appearnce of a tented <5ty.
Some of the sheltering places bear large
designating signs, notably Golden Gate
and Forest camps. California Camp was
profusely decorated with flags and bunt
ing and was the most attractive place on
the grounds. The headquarters of the
Woodmen Chips, the official organ of the
Woodmen In the northern jurisdiction of
the order, was prettily decorated.
By the time the first special train; that
from Sacramento and Stockton. - arrived
Â¦with the neighbors of the camps in those
cities the greater portion of the work had
been concluded for the ceremonies of the
evening. -Then the sounds of the ax and
the saw ceased, and the assembled dele
gates rested to await the arrival of the
late trains with hundreds of neighbors on
board.
The first train to arrive at the park was
the one from Sacramento and Stockton,
with about 250 Wpodnien â¢ from those two
cities. They -were an enthusiastic crowd
of choppers and were received with the
Woodmen'6 welcome, after which they
were escorted by the officers of the gen
eral committee to the headquarters as
signed to them. After resting for a. while
they began to make preparations for the
work they had for the night.
The executive committee, the busiest lot
of men on the grounds, had headquarters
In a building alongside the pavilion, | and
from the time the trains began to
arrive until the Initiatory work com
menced they were kept occupied receiving
reports from th<Â» clerks cf each camp and

IN THE GROVE
In June. 1S30, F. A. Falkenburg, assisted
by Joseph Cullen Root. ' founded the
Woodmen of the World in Omaha, Nebr.,
and in the same month the PaciSc juris
diction. Woodmen of the World, was or
ganized by Mr. Falkenburg in Denver. In
June. 1Â£99. the Woodmen of the..World in
cluded a single member; to-day 70,000
names are enrolled in the nine Western
States and 220,000 in the United States and
Canada. Falkenburg has been head con
sul of the order since its birth and Is said
to bo without a peer in this country as an
organizer.
The idea of founding the Woo<lmen of
the World originated with F. A. Falken
burg on the summit of Pikes Peak; One
<lay in September. 1SS9, a special train left
Denver for Manitou Springs, which place
lies at the foot of the famous peak. The
special carried four candidates for inltia
tior. in a sister order, Falkenburjr, the
Initiating officer, and others. This was
before the famous cogroad was built to
the peak and the ascent from Manitou
Springs was made on burros. Four news
paper reporters followed the party and
.were not discovered until on the very
summit, Â¦when they Â¦were given the alter
native of joining the order or of spending
the night in confinement. They were ini-
VLlated.
It was an all night session. On the
summit, 14,479 feet above the sea, huge
bonfires cast their light on the impres
sive scene. As the stars went out and the
rising eun dispelled the morning mists
Falkenburg stood watching the vast pan
orama below. As it gradually unfolded
the Idea was born then and there of or
ganizing an institution that would be in
ternational in its Bcope. The idea has be
come a reality and to-day "Love, honor
and remembrance" is the . watchword of
one of the largest xraternal beneficiary
orders operating in the nine Western
States.

ORGANIZATION
OF THE ORDER
WITH colors flying, drums beat-
Ing and bands playing, the
Woodmen of this World start
ed over a thousand strong
from Pioneer Hall yesterday,
pearlng with them over 400 happy captives
â¢rtio were later Initiated In the. mysteries
pt the order amid the gloomy fastnesses
of Ffernbrook Park.
â¢ The procession started for the ferry at
6:15 o'clock and was enthusiastically
cheered along the entire linÂ© of march. It
tras headed by Grand Marshal William C.
BlalBdell, who on a prancing eteed that
pranced Just enough but not too much,
cut Quite a stunning and martial figure.
The degTee team of Calumet Camp and
details from Mission and Golden Gate
camps, under the command of Captains
Btuart and McCourtney, acted as escort
to the marshal.
Following- tie escort came a brass band,
resplendent In gold lace, and then the
prisoners under a heavy guard of Wood
men veterans. Among the most prominent
of these sacrificial lambs were City and
County Attorney Frank K. Lane, who
eeemed cheered with the knowledge that
for once in hie life he had a proposition
before him which involved no question of
â¢water rights; United States Attorney M.
B. Wooaward and John Fouga, who
marched along hand in hand, sustaining
each other in their predicament. Colonel
Boxton of the "Fighting First," and a
host of other celebrities were there.
Following- the "prisoners" came the ten
camps that composed the parade, with
two more bands at Intervals. Conspicuous
\ among those composing this part of the
/procession was D. Oliver Jr., chairman
âof the executive committee, to whose ex
ertions and excellent management of the
Â¦whole affair Its satisfactory- start must.
In a large measure, be attributed.
Though there are but 400 candidates
from San Francisco to be initiated, there
are so many from other towns ready to
be taken into the fold that the total num
ber will run something above 1390. Merton
Allen, who has been acting as the apostle
of the organization, is responsible for a
preai number of these converts. His work
has been unceasing' and the resuK -* his
labors in the vineyard is a source of much
gratification to his brother Woodmen.

ever met in California.
At onetime in the early part of the
campaign the executive committee waa of
the opinion that the initiatory work
should be performed by a team of one of
the camps, but after consideration ifc was
thought that such a course would engen
der jealousy, so the committee by a unan
imous vote decided that that work should
be performed by members of the depart
ment of organization; so Merton C. Allen
deputy head consul and city organizer'
was selected as past consul commander*
W. L. Temple. State organizer, as consui
commander; B. F. Ledford, district organ
izer, as lieutenant adviser; A. J. Wein*Â»rt
city organizer, as banker; Burdette Cor
nell, district organizer, as escort, and F
E. Trimble, district organizer, as watch
man. These officers were perfect in their
work and the manner in which they per
formed their several duties won for them
praise that was well deserved.
The Initiation was engineered by the fol
lowing officers and members:
At the close of the initiation of the se
lected candidates there were log-sawing
and wood-cutting contests participated m
by the teams from the various camps In
attendance and these were followed by an
instrumental and vocal musical pro
gramme. The affair ended with a mid
night banquet beneath the trees. "With
the initiations of to-night the local camp
has more than 600 members.
the center to allow all persons present to
have a full view of the ceremony. The
evergreen decorations were brought up to
the ceiling in such a manner as to form
an arch. From many points of this arch
were suspended brilliant lanterns that
shed a soft light, over the novel scene.
The station of the consul commander was
oa the south side of the pavilion, and
back of that was spread a large American
flag. At one side was a rustic path, and
steps which had the appearance of hav
ing been hewn in the forest for the pur
pose of allowing tho3e who took part In
the ceremony to reach the central point.
, On the other side of-^the consul com
mander's station was a round tent for thÂ«
Ishmaelites, who took part in one of the
great scenes produced for the purpose of
impressing the candidates with the lesson
of fraternal help in time of need. At the
stations of the lieutenant adviser, the
banker and the past consul commander
there were stumps cut at Fernbrook, and
the working tools upon each stump were
of wood cut on the ground, with the idea,
of making all as realistic as possible. To
accommodate all who could not get inside
of the pavilion there was erected an im
mense tent on the north side, the end
facing the structure being open so as to
allow all who found sitting or standing
room to have a view of the officers at
W O I*Â£C.
The committees which had charge of
the wholesale initiation had been at work
for several weeks and their plans were
successfully carried out. Immense bonfires
were -lighted and an eleven-gun salute

Elsie Wallace was 18 years of age and
had been a student at the Normal School
for a year and a half. She was unusual
ly bright and pretty. Imogene was 16 and
graduated last June from the Calrumja
School. She expected to enter the high
schrol next month. The body of Imogene
Wallace was brought to the surface this
evening with the aid of a drag net.
Elsie Wallace was an accomplished mu
sician and played the piano at the Sunday
school and Christian Endeavor services of
the West End Congregational Church.
In the meantime swimmers and divers
searched the water for the bodies of the
other two and the large crowd that had
gathered watched along the beach.
As soon as they saw their danger the
young men worked until exhausted, try
ing to get the girls ashore. Wilkinson
could swim and clung to Cora, who had
separated from the other girls, and tried
to pull her ashore, but she was washed
from him. lie was so exhausted that it
was with extreme difficulty that he got
out of the water. Smith, who could not
swim, had a still harder time, and when
he reached the shore sank on the sand,
completely worn out from his battle with
the breakers. His companion had enough
strer.gth left to run for help.
J. Y. Carruthers, the first man who re
sponded, is powerfully built and a good
swimmer. He rushed into the water and
in a second saw Miss Cora Wallace float
ing. The others were not in eight and he
devoted himself to an attempt to save
her. When he got her ashore a blanket
and restoratives were brought and a man
was dispatched for a doctor. Dr. J. N.
Wood and Dr. Frank Wood worked for
two hours trying to restore the life that
was extinct.
The undertow was very strong and
there is no life line for the benefit of
bathers, so the young people were at the

A committee representing the citizens of
Dubois, Pa., has forwarded a statement
to J. P. Morgan offering to give a bonus
of $1,000,000 to have the McKeesport mills
moved to Dubois. V
If the mil! is removed, he says, there
will be another to take its place. In con
clusion. Mayor Black declares that he is
"heart and soul 'with the men engaged in
the strike."
I have served many. years in the Councils
of the city," and I know what I am talking
about when I assert that every request made
by the mil's here for the vacation of the
streets, for special privileges and special bene
fits has been cranted. They have never been
backward in asking what they wanted. They
have never asked in vain.
The trust mills here to-day pay. taxes on
assessment valuations of v a. trifle over . 4 per
cent oC their real value. On the other hand,
the latorlng man who owns his own house is
taxed to three-cniarters of the real value of
his home. Were the trust taxed on the samr
basis It would take thousands of j dollars an
nually from the trust coffers.
Continuing, the Mayor declares that talk
of the removal of the mill is an old story.
When the trust bought the property, he
says, it was claimed that there was not
ground enough and that the mill would
have Â¦ to be moved. Of McKeesport's
treatment of the trust he says: . Â¦
The reason which the trust gives for the re
moval is that the Mayor and people of Mc-
Keesport are hostile to the trust, or, in other
words, because the people of the city and chief
executive Â¦ favor the oppressed against the op
pressor; because their sympathies are with the
downtrodden' and against those who seek to
enrich themselves by ill-requited tollnhe. trust

Ever since tne memorable day in

news "The Sherman is in sight," relieved
the tension that bound the entire city's
Inhabitants. The Call has striven to
educate the people up to the value of
wireless telegraphy. This all Important
message was sent over sea and land and
apprised the residents of the city that the
transport Sherman, bearing California
.volunteers home from the war, had been

and the Shamrock. Marconi manipulated
the keys that flashed the description of
the great race over the waters and the
world was given a minute account of the
contests.
The dispatch sent to Congressman Julius

the Xew Tork Herald is transmitting

Great Schemes in View.
The Call's correspondent understands
furthermore that a New York City elec
trician of national prominence wUl, at the
coming session of- Congress, attempt to
pass through that body an appropriation
for relaying messages from Island to Isl
and in the Aleutian chain of the North
Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Siberia. He
will use the islands as stepping stones
across the North Pacific. He will first
attempt to interest the Russian Govern
ment In the enterprise and if successful
will endeavor to induce the United States
to act In conjunction with that country.
At first blusn this would appear to be a.
visionary plan of the Jules Verne type,
but he asserts confidently that he will yet
send wireless messages from the Ameri
can to the Asiatic continent, thus getting
in ahead of Nikola Tesla, who talks of
sending messages across the Atlantic. Of
th-i two visionary plans that of the
former would appear to be the more prac
tical.
telephone transmitter Is too feeble to
travel a long distance without wires.
The feeble alternating currents gener
ated by a telephone transmitter have
been conveyed for short distances with
out wires, rendering speech possible for
a mile or two, but for distances of thirty,
forty or fifty miles a powerful battery/
and induction coil are- required and there^
must be a complete make and break of'
the current instead of mere variation of
pressure at the point of contact, as In the
case of the telephone. But as is well
known to any one who has used a tele
phone receiver, that Instrument Is cap
able of rendering distinctly audible dots
and dashes of the Morse alphabet when
complete make and break is made by a
key and this fact will be taken advan
tage of.
resented to be a great caving will be ef
fected, for the Government proposes to
utilize the wireless telegraphy on a big
scale.
The Call correspondent learns % from an
inside source that the Weather Bureau
will have a chain of stations extending
along the entire Atlantic coast from
Maine to Florida, and will eventually
have a simpler system on the Pacific
Coast. The wireless messages will be re
layed from station to station. Messages
have been, successfully sent over land by
the Weather Bureau system for distances
of from thirty to forty miles, and. It is
hoped to gradually increase this distance
in order that so many relay stations will
not be required.
Jealously Guarding Method.
' The Weather Bureau is jealously guard-
Ing its method, but The Call correspond
ent has reason to believe that an ordinary
Bell telephone receiver is used to receive
the messages instead -of the coherer ajid
Morse sounder. It is well known that a
telephone receiver with coils wound to a
resistance of from 75 to 100 ohms 13 the
most sensitive apparatus known to elec
trical science, not excepting the galvono
meter. The telephone receiver is affected
by a current too feeble to have any sensi
ble effect on the galvonometer, and it has
been estimated by Mr. Preece, the great
English authority on telephones, that the
electric current required to generate a
sixteen candle-power incandescent light
would make sounds distinctly audible In a
billion telephones. It must not he sup
posed, however, that articulate speech
will be attempted by the use of a tele
phone receiver in connection with a wire
less telegraph' system, for the current
generated by variation of resistance in a
PLOT TO SINK

Now that The Call has succeeded In se
curlngthis valuable aid to the merchants
the people of this country will await the
results with deep interest.
"I believe it to be within the province
of this Government to construct . such
telegraph system for the better protection
of our merchant marine. Also, It would
be of advantage to vessels In the Govern
ment Â¦ service. They could communicate
with or receive orders .^without/the neces
sity of coming into the harbor. Vessels
arriving off. the port in distress or requir
ing the services of a tug or other assist

the. islands communicate with the ' city.
A dozen other interviews with such well
known citizens of influence as George A.
Newhall, president of the Chamber of
Commerce; Frank J. Symmes, president
of the Merchants' Association ; A. A. Wat
kins, president of- the San Francisco
Board of Trade, and A. Sbarboro, presi
dent of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, have been printed in these
columns. These gentlemen not only favor
tne establishment of the wireless tele
graph, but demand it for the benefit of the
vast and increasing commerce on . this
coast. . â¢ >
"The Merchants' Exchange has its look
out station at Point Lobos at a" high ele
vation, and as the Farallon Islands are of
sufficient height the expense of construc
tion would be minimum. The Merchants'
Exchange has a telephone line connecting
the Point Lobos station with the ex
change, so that any message sent in could
be promptly transmitted to the proper
address. â¢
Of Value to Government.
"Regarding the advantage of a wireless
telegraphy system between the Farallon
Islands and San Francisco via Point L.o
bos, I am pleased to say that I believe,
if the system Is practicable; its advantage
to the shipping Interests would more than
justify the expense of construction and
maintenance. It is one of the many, re
cent advances in electrical, science that
has practical value and should be put
into operation wherever it can be used to
the benefit of our commerce.
That the merchants of this city are in
favor of wireless telegraphy is evidenced
by the sentiments expressed some time
ago by G. W. McNear, president of the
new Merchants' Exchange. He said:
"The usefulness of a prompt service be
tween this city and the Farallones is well
understood by all who have any interest
in shipping news; nor would it be outside
the legitimate province of the Govern
ment to establish it. ; In fact it would be
but an extension of the lighthouse ser
vice."
"Of the' 1 feasibility of the service there
can be no question. Reports from Europe
are to the effect that the British have
wireless telegraph stations at every dan
gerous headland along their foggy and
stormy coasts. The Germans and the
French also have adopted the system to
a considerable extent, and only recently
the news of the day illustrated the use
fulness of the service In the case of a
steamer passing a lightship off Dunkirk
and receiving across the water a wireless
message to the effect that the illuminat
ing machinery . of the lightship was out
of order and that unless relief were sent
there could be no light on the ship that
night. The steamer reported the news as
soon â¢ as she reached port and men were
at once sent to make repairs, so that the
lightship showed her signals as usual. In
that case the wireless message may have
saved from wreck some vessel passing In
the night and missing the familiar light
from the ship. Â¦ ,â¢
The following Is an ' extract from an'
editorial which appeared in the columns
of The Call on June 14:
especially to the Pacific Coast."
The method of wireless telegraphy is
also kept a secret by Professor Dinwoodie,
the expert In charge. The object is to dis
pense with the coherer, so as not to in
fringe on Marconi's patents. Marconi's
invention, as is well known, is based on
the fact, that when a feeble current of
electricity. Is passed through a Bramley
tube filled with minute particles of metal
filings', these filings, which in a loose state
are non-conductors. Immediately, become
good conductors for the current and estab
lish contact in a local circuit In which a local
Morse sounder is included. The Marconi
instruments are quite expensive, costing
about $1500 each, and the annual royalties
are about $1000 for each instrument, so
that if. the Weather Bureau's experi
ments are as successful as they are rep-
When The Call first broached the plan of
erecting a wireless telegraph station on
the Farallones under Government auspices
Secretary Wilson wired to A. G; McAdie,
the weather forecast official at San Fran
cisco, promising to install such a plant
just as soon as it was demonstrated be
yond doubt that a system could be suc
cessfully operated. But the. department
did not wait for â¢ others to ' make the
demonstration, for Mr.' MoorÂ© with
promptness and energy immediately In
structed experts to begin experiments, and
they have been quietly conducted ever
since The Call first suggested the project.
The experiments have been conducted
with great secrecy, the department not
even making known the exact locations,
but as will be seen from Mr. Moore's let
ter experiments are being made "at cer
tain stations oh the Atlantic coast."

Mr. Moore has for many years been
chief of the Weather Bureau and in the
absence of Mr. Wilson, who Is on a
month's vacation at his Iowa home, .is
Acting Secretary of Agriculture. Upon
the occasion of his . recent trip with the
President to the Pacific Coast Secretary
Wilson was greatly impressed with Cali
fornia and her people. He saw in San
Francisco vast possibilities and predicted
that the city would soon become next to
New York, the greatest metropolis of the
western hemisphere. The anticipated
trade with the Orient and . California's
abundant and almost boundless natural
resources, together with the geographical
advantage of the city and a magnificent
harbor were destined, he believed, to bring
about this result.

Richard Allman claims that In 1864 hl3
brother received from him, in trust, the
proceeds from the sale of certain property
owned by the claimant. John Allman, he
says, never made an accounting of the
$11,500 so paid to him. The interest, cal
culated at 7 per cent from June 1, 1864,
amounts to $33,637 50, making a total claim
of $45,137 50.
Richard Allman will try to have the
courts declare that his dead brother, the
late John Allman, well known as a pioneer
stage owner on this coast, was guilty of
having, wrongfully withheld $11,500 from
him nearly forty years ago. He filed a
claim against the estate to-day for that
amount and interest aggregating nearly
three times as much. â¢ . â¢

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
After ! that the raising of : assessments
was proceeded with. . The average raise
was- about one-third,- but in the case of
property at the lower end of -the district
the raise was small, â¢ while along â¢ Four
teenth street the increase was very great/
In some, cases - assessments were more
than doubled; and in some cases the addi
tion was fully one-half. S . -
The Increases Made.
"We remitted the assessment upon three
franchises and the Board of Supervisors
remitted the assessment upon nine fran
chises, yet they escaped all criticism and
we are attacked most bitterly. They, are
holding us up to attack, and claiming that
a pack of scoundrels from San Quentln
arÂ£ angels compared with us; yet. the Su
pervisors did more than we did. â¢-â¢ Now I
understand .what all . my friends meant
when they came to me around election
and said. 'Wixson, you are trying: to get
into the Council; but after you have been
there a month you could not be hired to
take, a second term.' The Council is at
tacked for doing just what, the Supervis
ors did without a word being said.".. <
This brought Councilman Bon to hia
feet. Bon was popularly supposed to be
the mild, pacific member of the Council,
but he has suddenly developed a capacity
for argument that his friends did not
suppose existed. â¢
"There has been some criticism of the
action of this Council in striking off the
assessment of the franchise of the Contra
Costa Water Company,", said Mr. Bon. "I
made the motion to do that, and both Mr.
Dornin and Mr. Wallace have been free
with their criticism of that action. I have
been watching: the papers, and I saw that
Supervisor Kowe. who comes from the
same ward as Mr. Wallace and who is
the close friend of both of those gentle
men, took the same ground that I did. It
was Mr. Bowe, I believe, who made the
motion in the. Board of Supervisors to re
duce the assessment there.' and the friends
of the gentlemen who are criticizing me
were the ones who voted for the reduc
tion by the Supervisors. I believe that
Mr. Rowe was right, and I am merely
following his example. Why don't they
criticize Mr. Rowe? The Supervisors can
take any action they please and not get
criticized, but when we do the same thing
in the Council we get hauled over the
coals." '. . "< â¢ ' - â¢
This brought forth a burst from Coun
cilman Wixson.
Supervisors Did Even More. ,
He told the Council that he was opposed
to this wa3' of doing- business and that
it was not fair to take the assessment off
a corporation and place It upon the
people.
This brought Councilman Wixson to his
feet, which is not a very difficult thing
to do.
"You evidently did not pay much atten
tion to the decision of City Attorney
Johnson," said Mr. Wixson. "That was
a very cunningly arranged decision. He
was ready to advise us that the olace of
business of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany was In San Francisco, but' he was
not ready to advise us that the franchise
should not be assessed here."
Â« "I meant no insult to my colleagues,"
replied Mr.- Dornin, "but it is a well
known principle of law that taxes shall
inure to the benefit of the people taxed,
and certainly that franchise was not as
sessable in San Francisco under those cir
cumstances." . -, -
The only excitement that occurred dur
ing the afternoon was when Councilman
Dornin made hie appearance in the Coun
cil chamber a little late. Mr. Dornin Is
one of the minority in the Council and he
has been the leader of that small fac
tion. Once In a great while Mr. Dornin
will make a few remarks and this after
noon was one of the times.
So Professor Wallace voted against the
first increase that was proposed. Then
he was shown a large map with the
streets and blocks and, assessments all
laid out thereon, and he was flanked by
Councilman Wixson Â¦ and a city expert,
who told him that this was a mere equal
izing of the assessments of the city. The
map was well drawn and the figures were
all marked In- various colored inks and
after that Professor Wallace voted to in
crease the assessments with the exception
of a very few.
Map Convinces Wallace.
. As soon as a quorum was secured the
Council settled down to , business, and
that business was the raising of the
assessments in the business section of the
city. . *
. CHy Clerk Church appeared with a pile
of prepared resolutions. These resolu
tions had all been settled upon in execu
tive session and nothing remained but to
adopt them formally in open session.
They covered every piece of property In
the district bounded by Clay and Broad
way, Eighth and Fourteenth streets, ex
cept some very few pieces . that were
passed for. future consideration.; at "the
request of the property owners'. With a
monotonous regularity Clerk Church read
the increases and with a monotonous reg
ularity they were adopted. - '
It required but six votes to adopt the
resolutions, but after the ! first one had
been passed Professor Wallace of the
Seventh Ward joined with the six of the
solid seven who- were present, and after
that there were no negative votes record
ed. Professor Wallace is a man of great
honesty of purpose and he seeks earnest
ly and sincerely to acquaint himself with
all of the proceedings of the City Council,
but the professor instills learning Into the
minds of the students of a denomina
tional college In the day time and to de
scend from ths heights of Highland Park
learning to the depths of the proceedings
of the Oakland City Council is too great
a drcp, and the professor sometimes fails
to grasp everything that is going on.
"It cost me $2 to locate Bon and I think
I ought to be reimbursed," was the report
that Boyer made of his mission.
Finally Boyer was delegated a commit
tee of one to' try to locate Councilman
Bon, and after half an hour's search
Boyer rounded him up and brought him
into the City Hall.
Costs $2 to Find Son.
The meeting at which these Increases In
assessments were made was an afternoon
aftair. it was supposed to begin at 1
o'clock, but at that hour President Schaf
fer and his ever faithful Courtney were
the only ones present. â¢ In course of time
A. W. Bishop dropped, in. Mr. Bishop has
the record of being the only man who did
not want to face the attacks of Frederick
Kahn and who voted against recalling
that fiery merchant, who had the temerity
to speak his mind. . Then . Wixson of the
Second Ward made his appearance, fol
lowed by Robert Boyer. . But it takes
seven to make a quorum of the Council.
Professor Wallace of the Seventh Ward
arrived, but that was only six. The six
waited and waited. /
The people who own property in the dis
trict bounded by Eighth street on the
south. Fourteenth street on the north,
Cla.y street on. the west -and Broadway
on the east are now asked to supply the
revenue that would otherwise have been
supplied by the water corporation that
was given a $7,000,000 valuation by Judge
Hart. Â¦ . -. ;
The property assessments in Oakland
went up with a rush this afternoon, â¢when
the City Council, sitting as a Board of
Equalization, got hold of them. There
was only one more rapid move that has
been made by this board, and that was
the reduction of the assessment upon the
franchise of the Contra : Costa "Water
Company after Councilman J. S. "Wixson
got over his attack of cold feet.

According to the testimony of the child,
which Is corroborated by Mrs. Groat and
a dozen ugly scars and bruises, Mrs.
Schwarting took no chances of spoiling
Annie by sparing: the rod. the rod in this
particular case being sometimes a poker,
occasionally the open hand. but. for pref

The poker is said to have been called
Into requisition a month or so ago for the
purpose of teaching Annie the wickedness

Gen. Manager. * Gen. Pass.- Agt.Decent Republicans will not give their votes to any one zvlw is thought, to be tinged ivith
Kcllyism. The "support" of Kelly will mean the defeat of the candidate. He is swaggering about
like the bloated loafer that he is, seeking to impress people zuith the belief that he can "handle"
votes. Anything Kelly handles Kelly zvill fry to steal. . Kelly cannot handle any Republican votes.
His pretenses to power in the Republican councils are absurd; his Swaggering assumption!) f au
thority)is ridicidous. . ...
Kelly is impudently shoving himself forward in order that he may impose ' on candi
dates zvho may be foolish enough to imagine he can aid them. He will take their money and be
tray than. . ' . . â¢ -
KELLY IS A RASCAL
Whenever the Republicans have been confident of victory Kelly's, weight'-, has tipped the
scales on the other side, and the Democrats, who know how- best to use Kcllyism, win. . He .has
sjwtehed many a defeat from victory, and yet he has grozvn richer and richer as the party loses.
KELLY IS DISHONEST. ;
He has a Fad reputation, bad from the standpoint of back room politicians, zvho judge from a
very low standard indeed; infamous from the standpoint of respectable citizens.
KELLY IS A MENACE.
Professing Republicanism, he stuff ed ballot boxes to beatM. M. Estce's gubernatorial am
bitions that he might secure the release of a' relative from San Qucntin. Mr. Budd turned the
convict loose, in return for Kelly's criminal treachery)
KELLY IS AN IMPOSTOR.
His presence affronts respectable Republicans, and the rank and file of the party, despise
him. What lie has done in politics has been for personal gain, and not from the motives that in
spire upright men to labor for the advancement of party principles. , Â¦; â¢ ;
KELLY IS A TRAITOR.
FHE Evening Post, directed by W. F. Herrin, chief counsel for the Southern Pacific x
Company, has taken upon itself the unenviable task of becom ng the champion of
ihe unspeakable Martin Kelly and all that he represents of evil in the social and political
life of this city, in opposition not only to the , opinion and wishes of reputable Republ:Â±
cans, but to the well-being of all decent citizens, the Evening Post is striving to advance the
cause and promote the interests of a man whom, in September, it denounced as a creature un
worthy of consideration, an indecent, despicable fellow nhose presence is an affront to respect
able people, a traitor whose criminal dupl.city brought shame to the Republican party, an im
postor who grows rich upon his treachery, a dishonest, infamous politician, a bloated loafer,
whose participat on in our affairs is a menace, and an impudent rascal who takes the money of . '-
candidates to betray them. : â¢
In September last this was the opinion of the Evening Post in reference to Martin Kelly,
whese character certainly lias not since improved. The Evening Post is owned by the Southern
Pacific Company, which supports the sheet with a monthly contribution, which dictates its policy
and insists upon the proprietary right of dotngfwith it as it pleases. Does President Hays wish
the pecpfe of this city to understand that this is the way in which he is keeping the Southern
Pacific Company out of Politics? Does Presiaent Hays wish the citizens of San Francisco to
believe that he is using one of his engines to undo what decent men and voters have upbuilt?
Does he wish us to be forced to the conclusion that his reform is deceit and his honesty du
plicity? He pan answer by drawing the sting of his newspaper viper. â¢

The primary elections of all parties to elect
delegates to tbe various party conventions will
be held next Tuesday, August 13, 1901. The
day baa been declared a legal holiday. The
primary election, under the new law. is under
the absolute control of the Election Commis
sioners, and will be held under the same regu
lations as general elections, with sworn offi
cer* to receive and properly rpunt your ballot
and under every safeguard and protection of
the law. The delegates elected will nominate
the candidates of the respective parties for
Mayor and all other municipal offices. In
order to avoid mistake be careful to preserve
and use only the inclosed "paster," as there
will undoubtedly be spurious and confusing
ticket* in the field.
' REPUBLICAN PRIMARY LEAGUE.
THOMAS P. WOODWARD, President
I*. E. SAVAGE, Secretary.
Go to the polls next Tuesday and vote the
ticket of the Republican Primary League.
The inclosed "paster" is the official ticket.
Take it with you to the polls and paste It
on the black official ballot which will be there
furnished.
The vast majority of our people object to them
end their interference. Only by our apathy, by
our indifference, by our failure to vote at the
primary election can they possibly hope to ex
ercise a vicious control of our city.
It will take but a moment of your time to do
your part toward defeating the efforts of the
machine i>oliticlans.
This is an ispue which affects all citizens Ir
respective of party. Shall we control our own
municipal affaire, or shall these men control
them* for us?
The best citizens of San Francisco indorse it.
It Is opposed by Kelly and Crimmins, by cer
tain State and Federal officials, and by their
political manipulators from the interior of the
iState, all of whom have become part of the
Kelly and Crimmins machine with a view to
control the city of San Francisco.
Dear Eir: You are an honest man. Do you
favor Kelly and Crimmin6 as leaders of the
Republican party of San Francisco?
Do you want them to contror our loca! govern
ment? If not. vote the ticket of the Republican
Primary League at the primary election, next
Tuesday. August 13, 1901. It is pledge'd, with
out reservation, against these and all other
bosses, and is in favor of a clean, sound and
liberal administration of our city government.
The Republican Primary League was organized
on sound, sensible and practical lines to defeat
organized corruption, and to exert Its influence
in behalf of candidates who will give the city
&n honest, Btrongr and liberal administration.
The following circular has been sent to
each voter in San Francisco, together'
Â¦with a ticket of the Republican Primary
League in the district in which the voter
resides and the direction as to where to
vote:
The Republican Primary League.
Headquarters. S30 Market street,
SAN FRANCISCO, August 8, 1S0L
Official League Tickets.
In these two districts, the Thirty-sev
enth and Thirty-ninth, as well as in some
others, a bogus postal card system . of
nomination was attempted by which cit
izens were requested to name a person tor
delegate and were assured by the schem
ers that those receiving a majority of
recommendations would be placed upon
the ticket. As a matter of fact the tick
ets were made up by one or two men in
back rooms and made up without reference
to the desires of any voter. The idea of
Issuing the postal cards was to beguile
the voter into the belief that he was par
ticipating in some way in making up the
ticket, whereas as a matter of fact he
had no more to do with it than if he had
not received the postal.
A few slight changes have been made
in the Republican Primary League ticket
as published heretofore in The Call, but
there will be none further prior to elec
tion. The name of Harry Peterson was
taken off the list of delegates In the
Twentv-eighth District by order of the
executive committee and* that of Fred
Rolf substituted. In the Thirty-sixth Dis
trict the name of H. W. Melendy was in
advertently omitted. In the Forty-fourth
District the name of Frank Eade was
stricken oft and that of Charles Heinz
substituted.
Postal Card System.
The plan is a simple one and is intended
to deceive voters at the last moment. The
names of one or two leading Primary
League candidates are placed at the head
of a ticket bearing the designation "Regu
lar Republican Ticket," "Anti-Boss
Ticket" and so on. After the first few
names taken from the Primary League
ticket follow the names of the most pro
nounced henchmen of Boss Kelly and his
associates.
In the Thirty-ninth District, the club
presided over by D. H. Sklllin, which is
dominated largely by William T. Howe,
the son-in-law of Martin Keily. and by
other men of the same affiliation, has put
out a ticket headed with the name of Mr.
Skillin in opposition to the Republican
Primary League ticket, which is headed
by such well-known gentlemen as Dr.
Henry Gibbons Jr.. Jacob Greenebaum
and John A. Clover. A comparison of the
tickets in this district will show the Re
publican Primary League ticket to be far
ahead of all other tickets, both in per
sonnel and in principle.
In the Thirty-seventh District an at
tempt is being made to deceive the voters
by a ticket headed by W. L. Williamson,
the veterinary, and who is not in any
way connected with the member of the
Board of Health of similar name. This
ticket was put up as a piece of political
jobbery with the intention of taking away
votes from the Republican Primary
League ticket and of indirectly throwing
its strength to the Kelly and Crimmins
outfit.
Spurious Tickets Issued.
Apathy on the part of the respectdTble
class of Republicans has given away to a
determination to administer at the polls
such a crushing defeat to the Boss ele
ment that naught but a remembrance of
this polluted political outtit will remain.
The assistance of Rainey. late Democratic
boss, has been called to the aid of this
queer Quintette. Kelly, Herrin, Gage,
Crlmmins and Lynch. The' Republican
Primary League is out for clean politics,
and as it is known to be thoroughly anti
boss spurious "LÂ«ague" tickets are being
issued in every district.
\
EVERY trick and device that pollt :
leal chicanerj- can conjure ts being
"employed In the last few hours of
the primary election campaign for
decent politics, now being waged
by the Republican Primary- League,
against the remnants of the boss com
binationâKelly, Herrin, Gage, Crimmins
and Lynch, who on next Tuesday will en
deavor to overthrow the decent element
in the Republican party.

ADVISORY BOARD ORGANIZED.
At a meeting of shareholders at this offlce
Saturday. August 19. an Advisory Board of the

west. The board consists of nine members,
whose names win be later announced by cir-

A DIVIDEND DECLARED.
The Montezuma Mining Company has an-
nounced its first quarterly dividend, payable
October 31. 1S01. of $1 per thousand shares of
paid up stock: that Ijelng equivalent to 5 per
cent per annum on the average cost of shares
for the past six months. This dividend comes
from a single sale of coal and agrees .with the
policy to which the company Is committed."
Other and larger dividends may be confidently
expected from the same source as the produc-
ing capacity of the coal mines is increased.
Present price of shares Is ISc cash or 21c % on
Installments. These are strictly ground-floor
prices and the expenditure of a little money
Â¦will put one In poFeession of a considerable
block cf what is confessedly the best mining
etock on this or any other market at the price.
He who, waits for the low-priced stock of a
new company will lose the three years that the
Montenima has gained from Its success In
placing of chares. Write to us for full Infor-
mation concerning this big. strong, safe min-
ing company of Washington.

The terms of the sale were one-quarter

per cent.
The other principal transactions of the
week were the purchase by the National
Ice and Cold Storage Company of a lot on
the south side of Lombard street, 137:6
west of Sansome, on which a nine-story
building will be erected, the total invest
ment representing an outlay of $125,000.
Charles I* Tilden Is also a purchaser of
property in the same vicinity, which will
also be devoted to cold storage purposes.
He has secured the Haslett warehouse
property*, owned by the Clarke estate,
and located on the west side of Front
street, between Broadway and Vallejo
street, for $40,000. This building, which is
one of the old landmarks of San Fran
cisco, will be altered to fit it for cold stor
age purposes. Another large transaction
in which Tilden figures as the purchaser
represents the transfer of a lot on the
southeast side of Mission street, 223 feet
northeast of Fifth, the size of the lot be
ing 120x160 feet, the consideration named
being $85,000. With the continued im
provement of Mission street, especially at
its lower end, the property is expected to
quickly increase in value. . .
Building operations 'are very slow and
owners are afraid to conclude a number
of pending .contracts on account -of the

Comparative dullness has marked the
real estate market the last week Two
conditions combined- to produce this re
sult. The first is the summer exodus of
those whose wealth permits them to en
gage in large transactions, and the sec
ond and more Important is the very much
disturbed situation in labor circles. With
an early settlement of labor troubles buy
ers and sellers could be quickly brought
together and impending deals of consid
erable magnitude -vould be consummated.
The total sales for the last month ag
gregated 391, with monetary considera
tions Involved of $2,601,359. All parts of
the peninsula are represented in these
transactions, the larger number being in
the Mission and Western Addition.
During the same period 347 mo rtgaÂ»es
were recorded, covering'. *L8b7.aT7. while
the releases were 243. amounting to
$843 0Â°9
One 'of the peculiarities of the last
month was the great demand for nats.
These domiciles are scarce and in the
choice locations bring good rentals. As
the business portion of the city expands
into heretofore choice locations the de
mand for flats has spread over the entire
city. Lots in the northwestern portion of
the city, worth from $1000 to $2500, accord
ing to Magee's Real Estate Circular, are
very much in demand in the districts
bounded by Vallejo, Union, Buchanan and
Devisadero streets and Clay and Jackson
streets and Central and First avenues.
The demand for property in the Mission
and Panhandle districts ia rep.orted slow.
John Shuey has bought from H. Felge
the row of flats on the west line of Capp
street, near Twenty-fifth, for $6500.

scores:
In the puppy stake Colma Belle beat
Rowena, a 6 to Â»1 favorite; Flora Temple,
at 5 to 1, beat Becky Sharp; Real Aristo
crat beat Fenti at 5 to 3.
At Union Coursing Park yesterday tha
initial rounds of the two stakes offered as
the regular weekly attraction were pro
ductive of clean, fair testa. In the open
event the results were quite satisfactory
to the talent. Throughout the run-down
the favorites were successful in all but
five courses. Â¦ Bona tide, the first short
end to get the flag, beat America, a 3 to I
choice, and in tn<Â» next course Bridget
Cleary outpointed A. R. Curtis 1 youngster,
Blue Ribbon, in a Ions, hard run at odds
of 5 to 2. Naughty Girl, with 8 to 1 against
,her, beat Shadow for the decision. Tho
Grafter, on whom the wise ones had
placed their small change at the rate of
5 to 3, failed to score a point in his go
with Tapioca. After a monotonous run of
twenty-two courses with out cashing tha
pikers found a helper in Crockett Hill.
Five to two that Best Bargain would win
the course was taken by the pikers, wfto,
with this winning, scored their last in tha
The course between. For Glory and
Rocker bordered somewhat on the sensa
tional. The dogs neared the hare when
close to the fence and together drove In
in an effort to secure the kill. For a mo
ment all that was visible was a heavy
cloud of dust, and when it cleared away
both dogs were seen recovering from an
upset, but without the hare. The Jack
had taken advantage and was seeking
the escape .when For Glory sighted and
with her companion was soon in pursuit.
When the pair came together again For
Glory killed and got the flag.
For stake honors it looks as though
Flying Fox, at 6 to 1, has almost a cer
tainty on second place at least. Palo Alto
is the choice at 2 to L He figures to meet
Rector in the third round. Rector Is at
5 to 1. and despite the difference in pries
has a good chance to take the place which
the wise ones have allotted to Geary" a

The Financier says: The bank statement of
last week showed a decrease of â¢ $1,212,400 in
surplus reserve, which was due to the com
paratively small gain of $1,154,800 in cash and
also to the increase of $2,367,200 in the reserve
required against deposits. The loans were aug
mented $2,948,7C0, which may be regarded as a
net unusual Increase at this season of the year.
The cash Items were affected last week chiefly
by the ordinary treasury operations and also
by the transfers of Internal revenue collections
from Western points to the sub-treasury, which
together nearly offset ' the payments by that
office In checks for Yukon gold, so that the
banks gained loss than $500,000 through. the sub
treasury. The Interior bank movement resulted
in a net gain to the banks of about $2,000,000.
There were indications at the close of the week
of a lighter movement of Internal revenue
transfer hither and unless there should be an
important decline of money to the interior for
crop purposes, which is not expected, the banks
may, through the receipts of Yukon gold checks
and payments for bonds, get In fairly large
amounts of cash during the current week.
The Increase of $9,468,800 deposits very nearly
corresponds with the gain in loans and the
net Increase in cash,' so that the statement
is greatly out of harmony. It - would appear
Improbable that the bank return should be con
sidered â¢ in any degree unfavorable from | the
borrowers' standpoint and even should. surplus
reserves be further drawn down from the cur
rent week there would seem . likely to be an
abundant margin for all ordinary requirements.
So far as it concerned the movement of money
to the Interior for crop purposes, though orders
were received at the end of the week for the
transfer through the treasury of $500,000 to Chi
cago,-It was not supposed In banking circles
that this really indlceted the beginning of the
demand for money for the crops. There was
good evidence on Saturday; that the tension In
the foreign exchange market was relaxing and
unless there should be an extraordinary de
mand for exchange It Is improbable that gold
will have to be sent to Europe and therefore
no apprehension need.be felt on this score.
Surplus, $20,952,950; decreased, $1,212,400.

Developments of the week were not suffi
ciently defined to afford much encouragement
to either bulle or bears, and the result was
a dull, narrow and unsettled market. In ad
dition the uncertainty as to the crop situa
tion continued in the absence of the Govern
ment monXily report and the wide variance In
estimates by recognized trade authority. These
conditions reduced public operations and lrom
day-to-day fluctuations represented only the
character of the professional views. Liquidation
was on a large scale early on uneasiness as to
the possible ramification of the steel strike and
crop scares. Discussion of the effect on gen
eral business by. the reduced purchasing power
of the wage-earners and farmers in the event
of their condition becoming critical was a
factor In limiting general speculation. Large
amounts of the United States Steel issues came
on the market, but the actual declines were
less than when the rupture first occurred weeks
ago. This circumstance was ascribed to the
formation of an alleged pool which was pre
pared to take enormous amounts at fixed prices.
The known conditions made professionals chary
of attacking the stocks, the possibility of an
early termination of the strike and the conse
quencesof a equeeze being weighed. Neverthe
less, their recovery from the low point when
various plants resumed work was checked at
times by "Influential" selling. Consistent sup
port was lacking for others stocks and specu
lative favorites such as Sugar, St. Paul, Atchi
son, Union Pacific and Southern Pacific cov
ered a wide range, either way. frequently.
Pessimistic views regarding the damage to the
crops which had hitherto made large inroads
on prices of the grain-carrying roads were not
borne out by the tenor of the late advices.
Reports, of copious rains remedied conditions
somewnat and the Improvement noted by the
weekly crop report caused a modification of
alarmist reports. Stock prices reflected an ap

NEW TORK. Aug. 10.â Higher prices from
London were reflected in a fairly good tone for
railroad stocks at the opening, but small gains
were soon wiped out and prices dipped â¢ well
below yesterday's, close for Important stocks
on a renewal of professional selling. The In
terest excited in the Government monthly crop
report and the prospect of some Important de
velopments In the stock situation next week
caused a large diminution In the volume of
business. The paucity of the demand helped
to Increase the downward tendency which was
most marked In the grangers. Pacifies, coalers
and Southwe6terns. Missouri Pacific and kin
dred stocks were influenced by denials of re
cent reports of the impending absorption cf
Mexican railroads. Aa on the two preceding
days, Missouri Pacific spurted up sharply at
the close, the final figure to-day bringing, it
to yesterday's level. But little interest "at
tended the fluctuation in the United States
Steel stocks to-day, their movement being only
fractional, but indicating better support for
the common than for the preferred, the latter
ending %c lower. The bank statement, while
less favorable than anticipated, was without
any decided effect on the market. The clos
ing was irregular and almost lifeless.

Proznsions.
The Chicago market was strong and advanced
from 10c to 25c. This market was quiet and
featureless.
CHICAGO, Aug. 10.â Wheat opened strong
and #c higher at 71@71%e for September. High
er cables and small receipts were the strength
ening influences. Trading was rather slow,
however, during the first hour and the price
sagged to 71c. At that point the enormous ex
port demand created a buying movement for the
long account. A report that the -Government
crop report would show a decided decrease in
the acreage of spring wheat sent the shorts to
cover and September advanced quickly to"71Â«i
@71%c. Profit-taking caused a setback of %c.
The decline was checked by good outside buy
ing and the market ; soon took another' up
turn and again touched 71%@71%c. There was
little trading, during the latter part of the ses
sion and the price sagged off to 71%@71Â«.c,
where It closed. : . - . -

reports. September corn closed V,c higher at

oped In other grains. There was a good com
mission house trade. September . closed U<5%c
higher at 35%c.
Provisions 1 were firm, helped by the advance
In grain. Higher prices for hogs and heavy
buying by packers added to the strength. The
close was at an advance of 7Vic for pork, 10c
for lard and 12%c for ribs.

on a Government report day. Exports for the
week were the largest on record, being 8.8C0.000

less than last year. Clearances yesterday were
over 1,000,000 bushels, with New York to hear

against 210.0C0 last year. The Michigan State

yards were congested and Mission Bay ware
house was full and asking each merchant If
he had any objection to the company's de
clining to receive any more grain for San

CHICAGO. Aug. lO.-The Cadillac. thÂ»
defender for the American's cup. this aft
ernoon Â¦ won the first of the International
yacht races, beating the Royal Canadian
Yacht Club's challenger Invader by eight
and one-half minutes. The race was sailed
around atrianguar course of seven nauti
cal miles to the leg, and the first leg was
exceedingly close. It had been planned
the third leg would be a beat to wind
ward, but a sudden shifting of the wind
soon after the start upset the calculations
of the committee. The first leg, which
was a free reach at the start, developed
into a port beat to windward, both boats
having to make a short tack before turn
ing the buoy. The second leg was a free
run before the wind, and that leg was a
fairly close-hauled reach.
The Cadillac finished fully a mile ahead
of the challenger. The Cadillac's elapsed
time was 2 hours 46 minutes 35 seconds.
Fifteen storesin all were 'burned .and
half a dozen dwelling, houses, whose "oc
cupants saved nothing and are now home
less. The private .water system at the
mills; saved :them from, destruction, else
the 'loss .would have been twice, 7 as great.
A; trainload - of < flour Â¦ standing in front . of
the: depot and hot ti owned by the Cana

ings.
Eagles poured . five ' gallons of oil over. ~a
pile of boards in the street outside Gar

many buckets of water, and wet blankets.

From the size of the waves and their
peculiar formation, it is probable that the
earthquakes , occurred In â¢ Alaska' or some
locality not far from Victoria, f and the
movements are very similar to those
which were recorded by the seismograph
on September 10, 1S99, and October 9, 1900,
both of which earthquakes â¢- so seriously
affected Skaguay. Unlike, however, the
two earthquakes above referred to. which
commenced abruptly and -with little or
no â¢ warning, ' In this Instance there were
preliminary tremors and quakes Â¦ nearly
four hours before the maximum or ex
treme severity was felt. :
.VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 10.â Bayne Reed,
the superintendent of. the Victoria meteor
ological office, reports that in all proba
bility news will shortly be received of
very serious earthquakes occurring in the
Alaskan region on the morning of Friday,
August 9. The seismograph, Which is part
of the equipment of this office, and which
was installed here by Professor. R. F. Stu
part in July, 1S38, gives : very clear details
of these shocks ; and the photographic
records show the disturbances to have
been the heaviest registered here.

CRONBERG. Aug. 10.â The church bells
have been tolling- throughout the day.
The Emperor, Empress, Crown Prince
and other princes drove over from Hom
burg this morning and were present at the
reading of prayers by the Bishop of Rlpon
et the side of the coffin of the Dowager
Empress. A requiem service was held iu
the old Catholic church. Bishop Eckerl
Â¦wing eloquently discoursed on the virtues
of the deceased.
All the Italian workmen at Cronberg
have been sent to Frankfort or have been
ordered not to leave their residences. The
military and police regulations are of the
most drastic nature and the facilities of
newspaper correspondents are much cur
tailed. The village is full of troops and
present* a scene of great bustle. Officers
and mounted orderlies and other messen
gers are hurrying to and fro, completing
arrangements for the funeral.
Emperor William has conferred on Pro
fessor Renvers the title of Privy Sanitary
Councillor, and has also bestowed an or
der on Dr. Spielhagen, who, with Profes
eor Rtnvers, attended the Dowager Em
press during her Illness. In addition the
elx ladies in waiting of the deceased Dow
ager Empress have received Red Cross
medals.
It 1b understood that Prince and Prin
cess Frederick Charles of Hesse will in

youngest daughter of the deceased Dow
ager Empress.
All day long the heat was Intense. From
2 o'clock this afternoon carriages and
vehicles of every description came stream
ing into the town, bringing sightseers
from Homburg, Frankfort, Xauhelm and
the country for miles around. Mingling
Â¦with the soldiers, detectives and workmen
engaged in erecting mourning masts, one
found a motley gathering intent upon
. seeking points of vantage from wnich to
view tne funeral procession.
From early this morning the military
held the streets and none but a most priv
ileged few were permitted along the route
to be taken by the cortege. At the bend
wnere the road reaches the old part of the
town is a great arch with green bows and
pillars, the support of which are four im
mense weird torches.

Punctually at 9:30 o'clock to-night the
Xar-off sound of muffled drums and the

through the distant trees told the people
of Cronberg that the procession had left
Frederlchshof As the glare of the up-
Ilited torches drew nearer down the wind

elve line, on the shoulders of a dozen
soldiers. Then another flare revealed the

with somber tread just behind the coffin
