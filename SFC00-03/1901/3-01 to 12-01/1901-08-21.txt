SEATTLE. Aug. 20.-J. T. Snyder. a
resident of Juneau, arrived on the
steamer Farallon to-day from
Juneau. Mr. Snyder was on the
Islander, but returned to Juneau
after escaping death in the disaster. He
was in the water three hours, clinging to
a raft, and was finally picked up in an
unconscious condition. He left the boat

The /quartermasters who were at the

of Pilot Le Blanc as to ice "having been
seen, and also as to the condition of the

the officers and crew, and of the efforts
to save the passengers at the risk of their
own lives. Second Mate Powell has
modified his statement that a man on a
raft drew a revolver and threatened him

them to leave the raft, and he now says
that the man simply threatened them and

George D. Gillespie has bee** a resident
of San Francisco for a number of. years
and has gained much notoriety as a. labor
agitator and a politician. He was the
State and county secretary of the Peo
ple's Party "committees at the time of its
organization in California and .was de
feated for the Assembly in the Thirtieth
District when he was a candidate several
; years ago. He was also the secretary . of
the Knights of Labor in San Francisco
and when that organization was strong In
Denver became its secretary T at that place.
Mrs. Griffin ;>ays the argument was over
unpaid rent a3 well as the disturbances
in the house. She says her husband did
not have a weapon and made no motion
whatever and that Gillespie had no reason
to suppose his life in danger. She also
aver3 that her husband was seated in the
chair when the shot that killed him was
fired. Soon after the ambulance arrived
she, went to. the Emergency Hospital and
was with her husband when he died. Then
she went to the home of her sister. Im
mediatc'y after the tragedy both she and
Mrs.' Gillespie went into hysterics and
were carried from the room. .
I got it I came back and told him that I
could play that kind of a game myself.
Then, with an oath, he placed his hand to
his hip pocket. I saw the motion and
raised my gun. As I did so I must hava
thrown great pressure on the trigger, for
the revolver went off and I saw Griffin
drop tack Into a chair and his head fall
over en his shoulder. I did not intend to
fire at that moment. I simply wanted to
cover him, so that he would not draw a
revolver, which I supposed he had."
"The captain had been drinking most of
the time after we left. I saw him at the
bar after 11 o'clock that night, accom
panied by one of the other officers, .and
they were quite noisy. When" the boat
struck we came on deck as soon as . we
could, but at no time saw the captain or
pilot. The steward was taking an active
part in lowering the boats, although some
one had told him not to do so. There is
no doubt that the boat could have been
beached and the lives of all the pass
engers saVed. The steward stayed with
her until she stood at. an angle of about
sixty degrees and then abandoned her
just as she plunged under the water. To
his aÂ«>*Vnty, courage and judgment, many
oi Cd owe our lives. There was simply
no discipline whatever among trie crew or
officers."
three brothers, and Arthur Longemak, a
party of miners who have been at Forty
Mile for the past four years, were return
ing on the Islander. Mr. Longemak said
in an interview: Â«
jumped overboard and they both held to
the same raft for fully a half hour-. In
conversation during that time the captain
said he could not understand why . the
boat went down so quickly. .
The captain said: "Boys. I cannot stand
It any longer," and, casting his life pre
server away, sank at once. At the Inquest
held in Juneau, which Mr. Snyder at
tended, evidence developed which may
tend to excuse the captain for not having
beached the Islander at once. Mr.
Enyder said:
"At the Inquest It was established be
yond doubt that the captain had been
drinking more than was good for him and
was In the saloon when the ship struck,
considerably intoxicated. The plrot testi
fied that he was on the bridge and that
as soon as she struck he told the captain
he was going to beach her, but the cap
tain said. 'No. there Is a better place
about three miles from here, and she will
easily float that long.*
"The testimony showed that there was
u. stowaway In the forward water tight
compartment, and when the vessel struck
the water rushed In on him and he set up
a crj'- He was immediately ' under the
sailors' quarters, and in response to his
Fhouts the sailors thoughtlessly rushed
down and opened the compartment, which
allowed the sea. U> come rolling Into. the
hold, carrying the body of the stowaway
and a sailor with it This was done with
out the captain's knowledge and I believe
affords an excuse for his error in believ
ing that the vessel would float several
hours. This it would have done had the
water tight compartment not been opened,
and he could have beached her in a small
bay about three miles away. It was
established that if the pilot had carried
out his intention he could have got ' her
on the beach without the loss of any lives
except that of the 6towaway and the
sailor. After I got on deck there seemed j
to be no one, in charge, although it ap
peared to rne that the steward did more
than any one else in lowering the boats
and getting- the passengers upon deck."

Captain Harris, formerly a sealing cap
tain and later on one â¢ of the Yukon
River steamers, was coming down as a
passenger. He was with' Captain Foote
In {be dlnlng-hall when the ship struck
and was on 'the bridge up to 12:30 o'clock
with Pilot Le Blanc. | He verifies the pi
lot's statement as to the condition of the
weather. When the ship struck he went
on the bridge with. the captain and heard
him give his orders in the coolest pos
sible manner. , When the boats" were low
ered Captain Harris went to the port
side, as the second mate had not yet
been called, and he says that every per
son who was in sight was taking to the
boats, .he being the- last one ' ( to leave.
As, to what happened on the starboard
side, he Is unable to say. Every life that
It was . possible to save, -he says, was
saved. The stewards did their utmost to
awaken passengers. Second Steward Fow

the captain believes many did not realize
the danger and went down' as they slept
Had others presented themselves there
was room for them in the port boats.
Andrew Keating and his 1 two sons of
L03 Angeles and this city were not seen
after the ship struck, and It is believed
they slept through it all and went down
with the steamship. _Â¦
Captain Ferry, one of the quarter
masters, says that when the doors of the
bunkers were closed to prevent the Inflow,
of water, there were eleven stowaways in

ordered the bunkers closed, did not know
that these men were still in the bunkers.

and that, he did not have a life preserver

and causing the raft to capsize.

WAS RECEIVED AT THE TREADWELL MINES,, WHENCE AN EXPEDITION WASAT ONCE DISPATCHED
TO PICK" UP AND CARE FOR THE SURVIVORS. â¢

nearly a year," said Gillespie. '"He drank
excessively and was frequently delinquent
inhis rent. The money, part .of It did net
bother me so "much, but in his, periods of

detective department in the Hair of .Jus

wished to surrender himself. -, Detectives
McMahori and Anthony, were detailed on
the case; and found the man where he
had agreed to meet them. He was charged
with' murder -and locked up. He made a
statement^ freely and secured an attorney
to defend ''him. .'
â¢ When asked ' to desist'.' Griffin, 'it is
said, insulted Mrs. Gillespie and. exhib
ited a knife. Gillespie, who had followed
his wife to the room, secured a revolver
and returned. More words followed and
a shot was fired, the ' bullet striking the
plumber in the' right eye, and causing
him t tq; drop back into a chair insensible.
He expired a short time later at the Cen
tral ,* Emergency Hospital and his body
was sent to the Morgue. When G^les
ple^returned to* the room Griffin had no
weapon out, nor was there any found on
his person, but the ! shooter says Griffin
made a motion as if to draw a revolver,
whereupon Gillespie . raised his own
weapon , and pulled the trigger uncon-

with .deliberation, and the shooter does
not '/dispute" that his. "motion -might, have

and quarrels between them were frequent.

them up one :month ago. He, came back
a week later and took other rooms, a\id

landlord took him back "to the house on

chief was laid before them. They im
mediately, caught the trail and ran with
full speed to the home of Joe Lark, where,
on being, admitted, .they rushed into -the
bedroom and sprang upon the bed.
The cause of all the bloodshed was Â¦ftie
killing of Miss Caseila Wild Sunday after
noon as she was returning to her home,
one mile in tl.e country, after attending
church in town. She started home alone,
her brother lingering behind. About one
mile from tr.wn the brother found; her
with her throat tut, lying lifeless near a
culvert, under which her assailant had
attempted to drag her. Evidence of a
terrible ;irugf,le was shown. A copper
colored negro was seen sitting on the
bridge a slicit time before the tragedy
occurred. It is, supposed that the negro
sprang" upon her -.when she was passing
and attempted to force her beneath the
bridge. She fought* with such desper
ation that he could not accomplish his
purpose and he cut her throat in the
struggle. Her body was not violated.

Retail-Dealers' Meeting Approved.
A meeting of the Municipal Federation
of Improvement Clubs was held at Sara
toga Hall last night, at which the action
of the executive committee to bring about
a peaceful settlement of the strike was
unanimously indorsed. A resolution was
adopted to the effect that while the fed
eration was in sympathy with the move
ment inaugurated by the Retail Trades
Association the federation would not co
operate as a body with the retailors In
their mass meeting to be held at Metro
politan Hal! this evenlnr.
On the other hand, the leaders of the
Machinists' and Shipwrights' and-Calkers*
unions, as well as the Molders' Union,
declare that their fight never was In bet
ter shape than it is to-day. They assert
that the stories of men going back to the
Union Iron Works are fairy tales Invent
ed for effect. President McCabe of the
Iron Trades Council admitted yesterday
that some molders had gone back to the
Union Iron Works, but he adds that they
were not union men. He states that when
It was rumored yesterday that a nutn
_ber-.of. striking molders , had ..returned to
the Vulcan Iron "Works and to the Joshua
Hendy ; Machine "Works. Inquiry at -these
establishments developed the information
that the report was unfounded. A few
men went back ten days ago and it is be
lieved that many will return this week.
The managers of the works mentioned
claim to have private information to that
effect, the source of which they declare
it would be unwise at this time to divulge.
They regard the situation as being more
promising to-day, than at any time since
the strike was inaugurated.
'Strike Leaders Deny Reports.
-Mr. Scott *sta ted \ further that many of
the striking, machinists were now work-
Ing In- Eastern mills and iron works for
from 25 cents to $1 a day less- than they
received here. On. the other 'hand, ma
chinists were arriving from.the East daily
and accepting places made vacant by the
strikers at higher. wages than they could
hope to receive in the East.
"The 'strikers have simply put them
selves out In order that Eastern men
might take their places," he said. "We
regret this very much, but there is no
reason why we should refuse to employ
any competent mechanic if we need as
sistance, -regardless of where he halls
from. The places of the striking machin
ists must inevitably.be filled some time
and when that time -arrives there will be
no room for the* -strikers, even though
they should manifest a desire to return
to work. As far as the Union Iron Works
is concerned, it is impossible to grant the
concessions demanded by the machinists
without suffering financial loss. If we are
not to be allowed .to_ operate the works
at- a profit we might" as -well close them
down. As it is, the strike <has entailed
upon us a great loss of business already.
The -strike of ten years ago lost us all
our Arizona and-I^ew -Mexico business,
for the reason that the business was di
verted into other channels, from which
we were unable to wrest it' after the
strike was off. Nevertheless we are sat
isfied with the outlook. Our working force
is . augmenting daily. , and , many, of tho
newcomers are' union' men, notwithstand
ing the. denials of the union. leaders."
"Wages Higher Than in East
"I think the backbone of the machin
ists' strike is now broken. Our force at the
works Is growing gradually and many of
the men' who went out in May last have
returned. The statement was made in a
morning paper that we employed 105 mold
ers. This Is Incorrect. We never had
more than forty molders in our employ.
Of these 90 per cent are again at their
work. The molders had no valid reason
for walking out on a sympathetic strike.
It -was- a : costly move 'far the- men: con
cerned and those who have gone back
accept the old schedule without question.
Of the men who went . to work to-day
there were' some twenty' mechanics, in
cluding shipwrights, who took their old
places in the shipyards.- I. personally
know that some of. these are members cf
unions, but to what extent I am unable
to say. In addition to these there were
four or five boiler-makers and several
machinists, new arrivals from the East,
who accepted positions. This talk of
bribing men -to return- to their places Is
too absurd for serious consideration."
Henry T. Scott made the following
statement concerning the matter yester
day: ,-
The men for the greater part were em
ployed at the works before the strike in
May and many of them were connected
with the establishment for ten years or
more. Most of those who returned yes
terday were carpenters who walked out
to assist the machinists in their strike
for shorter hours three months ago. Sev
eral others, including a few machinists,
are recent arrivals from the East. Â¦
&Â»yps^HE machinists' strike situation
I underwent anothei change yester
1 day.' when some thirty men ap
l| plied for employment at'the Union
Iron Works and were accepted.
On the previous day twenty-one molders
and twenty-three mechanics resumed
work and it was expected that more
would follow their example yesterday.
PITTSBURG. Aug. 20.â Following the
rapid moves of yesterday on either side
of the great steel strike there was a lu'l
to-day and neither side took decisive ac
tion. The contest appears to be settling
down into a determined struggle, in which
neither side will acknowledge defeat while
there is hope* left. Joseph Bishop, the
Ohio arbitrator, appeared here again to
day, but both sides promptly repudiated
'the suggestion that another move for
peace was being considered. The steel
managers succeeded in starting the last
idle mill at the Clark plant and are evi
dently planning a series of extensions at
every point where there . is a chance of
success. . - . -,
They trill probably start the Star tin
mills in this city and Increase the force
at the I^indsay and McCutcheon mills. An
interesting feature of the fight at the lat
ter mill is contributed by the claim of the
strikers that Mrs. Fred Baugh, wife cf
the superintendent, is escorting- the strike
breakers to and from the mill. She has
always been very popular with the mill
men and the pickets say they' would
rather face a regiment of soldiers than
<1n. anything Improper in her presence.
They say that In peace times she nursed
their families and that they cannot iriter
fere with her or the men she escorts. The
Fteel managers are also- arranging for
more men for the Painter -and Monessen
mills. Â¦- ...~ - . i , ;. Â¦.

Schwab, was here to-day and conferred

Strikers Still Active. Â§Â§Â§Â£ %
The strikers met the movement 'to-re
cpen mills -with non-union men with the
claim that- it will be simply Impossible
to secure a sufficient number of skilled
men to operate â¢ them. Their men., they
declare, are standing firm and must be
consulted before. the mills run. They sav.
they have the situation well in hand and.
despite the alleged danger of the strike
getting top heavy, continue their work of
organization with a view of crippling
more plants belonging to the corporation.
They claim that Chicago will, in the end.
come out. and that there Is no danger of
the. Joliel men roing back to work.
President McMurtry of the American
Sheet Â¦. Steel Company returned to-day
from a tour through the five mill' towns
of the Klsklminetas Valley. He inspected
the non-union mills running In all of
them -'and also looked over the. two' non
union, properties being operated at Scott
dale. ' He said production was above -the
maximum average for this season ~qf the
year and that he was perfectly satisfied.
District Manager P. F. Â£mlth of the
company said to-night that.' the Wellsville
plant lacked but six men of having every
crew full, that the" product was'.coming

Xew York. Particulars of his negotia
tions are said at headquarters to be un
i known there and positive statements of
1 any officials are denied. A settlement of
the strike on terms advantageous to the
men has been the sole pur
.'*P.6se of Gompers' negotiations. He has
'promised them all the support and as
sistance in the power of the Federation
as an organization to give, and It Is
pointed out at headquarters that his state
ment made in Plttsburg last week carries
to one familiar with the workings of labor
I unionism an amplitude of suggestions and
deflnlteness of purpose which is not seen
by the lay eye and has been almost wholly
â¢ overlooked In the published comment on
that document.
â¢ Though his young son lay in an almost
dying condition as the result of in
juries sustained in a fall several weeks
ago, some opportunity of value evi
dently presented itself for Gompers'
service looking toward a settlement of the
steel workers' strike, for he left his son,
who has since been brought to Washing
ton, and went to Buffalo on his mission.
Not for Sympathetic Strike.
President Shaffer has no desire for a
sympathetic general strike of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, it is said here,
as he desires the Amalgamated Associa
tion to win by Its own strength if pos
sible. He does not expect financial as
sistance, because it is riot as yet needed,
and to call for it would be an admission
of weakness. The individuality of the
.president of the Amalgamated Associa
. tion is playing a distinctive part in the
steel strike. Union leaders here say the
: statement that the Federation workmen
in the Pennsylvania Tube Works mills at
Pittsfcurg struck last night and this
morning Under orders from Presi
dent Gompers. which assertion was at
tributed to President Schwartz of the
Pittsburg union. Is wholly denied here.
Gompers ftas no power under the constitu
tion of the Federation to call out men on
strike. This belongs entirely to local
â¢unions.

A warrant was sworn out for the arre3t

had a description of the man who did the
shooting and "asked -'the captains of the
vessels to muster their men in order that

might pick him out. . Therequest was-re
fused and the officers were compelled -to

him. â¢â¢Â¦ '
An attempt was made - yesterday by a
non-union man to kill two union pickets
who stopped him and endeavored to win
him over to the side of the strikers. That
he did not succeed was due to. his poor
marksmanship, as both the .men upon
whom he fired were standing within a
few feet of him. The men who' were made
targets of were John Grenlund and Jo
seph Green, the first named being a strik
ing sea cook and the latter a striking
teamster.
The shooting occurred at the' entrance'
to the Paclflcrstreet wharf about 10 a m
Grenlund and Green approached the-non
union man as I he was nearing the dock
and endeavored to enter into conversa
tion with him. , He was not in a talkative
mood, however,' and drawing a revolver
commanded the pickets. to shut up. Gren
lund informed him that he dare not* fire,
as no attempt had been made to molest
him. The non-union man thought differ
ent: however, and opened fire, sending one
bullet between Grenlund's . legs and an
other in proximity to Green's head.- After
firing 'the i two shots he turned and ran
down the dock. The pickets attempted to
follow him, but they were stopped at the

The third is the moral remedy. This Is ideal,
but to it we must come in the end. The, con
clusion of a strike is not a fundamental solu
tion. The brotherhood of man Is always the
last resort, and most people never practice
practical piety until they are compelled to do
so by paying an enormous price.
The second is the political remedy. I believe
in the ballet as a means of defense and cor
rection f or Â¦ worklngmen, but do not believe It
wise for workingmen . to organize separate par
tleB with the Idea of seizing' 'the- reins of
government. The Government does not belong
to the laborer any more than it does to the
employer. Let laboring men select the best
men for office. . ' "

marshes with celery and procured great num
bers of ordinary ducks. But the ducks wouldn't
eat the celery. Â¦ That has been the experience
of the Mayor and the Municipal League. The
ducks won't touch the celery.
There are .three.- possible bases for the solu
tion of the labor problem:.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
was tricked by the strike managers of the
Firemen's Union. Two men were sent to
the office of the firm to apply for work as
firemen. Â¦ They were hired and sent down
to the company's docks. They went to
work In earnest, but not on the coal
pile In the holds of the ships. They suc
ceeded in getting the ears of twenty of
the non-union firemen employed by the
company and talked so glibly Â¦ that they
convinced them that if they went to the
office they could demand 510 per day and
get it. TMe non-union men went up in a
body and made their demand, which was
promptly refused; and discharge papers
handed them instead. Report of the suc
cess attending the efforts of the two "hot
air passers" was made to the union, and
a great jollification was held at head
quarters. Ten of the'-, non-union men,
however, reconsidered their demands and
went back to the company and applied
for reinstatement. They -were put back to
work. â¢ .-
That some. of the strikers' are getting
tired of the strife was ; shown yesterday
by the action of five of the coal handlers
who left the .employ of Chandler & Co.
on the order of the City Front Feder
ation. â¢ â¢Â¦ They went to the office of the
coal company and applied for per
mission to go to work. They were
put to work with the non-union men.
Four longshoremen left the ranks of the
strikers also and applied at the Mail dock
for employment. Captain Anderson made
sure that they were sincere and were not
seeking an entrance to the dock for the
purpose of instilling union principles into
the men that have been employed by the
Mail dock In the places of tha strikers,
and then told them to go to work. Â¦
The loading" of the ships at Port Costa
and Vallejo seems to be the issue ju^t at
present. The various stevedore firms are
scouring the water front and every other
Â¦ section of the city for men to go to the
Contra Costa shores to work on the
vessels that have been tied up there since
the inception of the strike. Their efforts
have met with some success and the grain
dealers claim that they have men enough
now at work to assure the departure of
at least three of the deep water vessels
within a very short time. Twenty-five
longshoremen were sent to Vallejo on the
steamer Monticello Monday night to load
the Foyledayle with flour. Forty men
were taken to PoÂ»t Costa yesterday morn

"After considering the matter to some

matter over until to-day, when it was
decided that to- strike out the words 'as

back as Individuals and- sacrifice our
unions/ and we could see no reason why
we should even consider such a thought.

this by authority of the executive com

his decision to-day, dissolving the tem

a member of the association, began in

He alleged that the directors had no right
to build it and that they were exceeding
their powers. The answer waived all ques

It was in November, 1899. Nunes was
sick unto death, as he believed, and with
a true husband's 'devotion he called his
wife to his bedside and delivered to her a
deed of all the real estate he possessed,
to the value of $4000, and indorsed to. her
a note for $1500. All this was done.* he
claims, with the understanding that if the
death angel did not call she should give
back his property.
Health returned to the husband, but not
the wealth which he had voluntarily sur
rendered to his wife. He alleges that she
took advantage of the leverage given her
in the possession of all they owned, and,'
when trouble arose. Invited him to take
the outside of their domain. "Last March,
during a tempest of domestic infelicity,
she drove him from the home, so he
claims, and he is now an outcast. He
prays that the court compel the return of
the property, which she is now enjoying
to the limit. No sooner was it given to
her than she hastened to collect the note
and have the deeds recorded, and is now
In full possession.

SA3' HAFAEXs Aug. 20.â A fierce duel
between a wild cat and an eagle was wlt
nessfd on Sunday afternoon by City At
torney Thomas P. Boyd and a friend as
they were returning from Bolinas. It re
sulted in a victory for the bird, which
killad its adversary and made an attempt
to bear away its carcass.
"I was about half way up the Bollnas
side of the ridge when my attention was
attracted to a patch of < short sagebrush
on the hill Bide above the road," said Mr.
Boyd In describing the fight "That there
was something doing was evident from
the cries and the sound of breaking brush
that came from a small clearing in the
center. Clouds of dust arose above the
short brush as two objects tumbled about
on the ground. For some time I watched
xixe spot, unable to determine what the
combatants were.- My friend and I both
resolved to referee the fight, but from a
distance.
"After we had watched for several min
utes we were surprised to see a large eagle
rise fiom the brush a distance of about
ten feet and then swoop down again and
continue the fight. It did this several
times, until finally after one of these
fierce onslaughts there was only a brief
struggle and then the commotion ceased.
"Soon the great bird soared upward,
carrying in Its talons a. large wildcat. I
was not more than eighty yards distant
at the time. The cat wiggled and clawed
weakly. The eagle had it by the back.
After the bird cleared the brush with its
prey it Balled out over the canyon to the
â¢west, gradually rising In Its flight. After
crossing Bourne Gulch the bird began to
*soar upward until it had attained a height
of perhaps 500 yards. Then Its prey fell
from Its talons, and. like a tiny dark
epeck, shot downward to the gulch below.
The eagle, after losing its burden, made
several downward swoops after it as the
cat was railing. These seemed to be only
half-hearted efforts, however, and the
bird sailed away over the ridge toward
the Lajrunitas timber. The eagle had
about il ten-foot spread to its wings." .
Until "a* few months ago eagles were al
most unknown in this county. About two
months ago Thomas Button, a vaquero,
lassoed one at Kovato.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 20.â A number of
local winemakers to-day held an Informal
â¢meeting in the office of Guy. B. Bar ham
to discuss the present grape situation.
The winemakers are endeavoring to ar
rive at an agreement as to a price to be
paid for grapes at the outset of the pres
ent season. There seems to be a dlspo^
sltion on # the part of the vineyaxxtlsts to
stand off for a high price in the fallâ a
figure higher than the winemakers can
afford to pay, if the representations of
the latter are to be credited. The so
called Woolacott offer g of $23 a ton for
wine grapes has apparently made thn
growers Â¦ unwilling to listen to talk of
lower offers. The other wine men profe.M
to believe, that the Woolacott offer will
not stand the test of time. Mr. Woolacott
is now out of the city.'
The meeting to-day resulted In no defin
ite agreement as to a uniform price to be
paid, but it is believed an offer in the
neighborhood of $18 will be made.

A permanent telegraph office has been
established at Copper Center, which will
be of great convenience to the military
authorities as well, as to mining men.
The Government â¢ has a military reserva
tion at this place and it is a central point
for miners and prospectors going to or
coming from the Copper country or thn
Chesna district.
McBride is also wanted by the Chief of
Police of Salt Lake for. "rolling" a man
there a short time ago and relieving him
of a $250 watch. It is claimed that, when
Assistant Postmaster in Salt ' Lake, Mc-
Bride,. in 1897, was sentenced to the peni
tentiary for five years for embezzlement,
but was pardoned while â¢ the case was
pending on appeal. . $ '
When searched there were found on the
person of McBride and the woman and
in the different articles of baggage. a lot
of letters disclosing his whereabouts at
various times, just before and after the
postoffice robbery in Salt Lake last July,
a great many postofflce keys, chloroform,
knockout drops, etc. A more thorough
examination of the letters and papers
found in the baggage of the couple will be
made to-morrow, and after the arrival
of the other inspector it will be decided
whether to take McBride back to Salt
Lake now or wait for more evidence.
-McBride is wanted for complicity: in the
postofflce robberies in Salt Lake on July
14 and 31 last. He denies all* the allega
tions. The inspector says there is no
doubt he is the Â¦ man, but the conclusive
evidence has not yet been found. -
Â¦-. Early this morning Bennett obtained a
searcn warrant from Justice Mesick, ar
rested McBride and took possession of
the baggage of the couple. The two have
been released, but are under surveillance.
Inspector Sharpe is expected here to-mor
row with additional evidence. - -
BAKER CITY, Or., Aug. 20.â Frank Me
Bride, who is said to be the son of ex-
Judge McBride of. the Supreme Court of
Utah and nephew, of ex-Senator George
W. McBride of this State, accompanied
by a woman named Claypool, who claims
to be his wife and has a child about 7
years of age,, which she says is theirs,
arrived here last evening. .They were fol
lowed by Inspector Bennett of the United
States Postofflce '- Department of Utah,
who has been tracing them from place to
place for, some time by intercepting their
mail. It is alleged that McBride left be
hind him in Utah a wife and two small
children. , . 'Â¦-.' . v
On the 27th of April, in latitude 17 20 and
longitude 157 30, Frank Hodges, another
sailor, deliberately sprang to his death
during a dark, stormy night.
These unaccountable acts were reported
to the customs officials and were accepted
until the fact developed that of all im
portant papers to be mislaid, the crew
list of the Wood was missing. As a con
sequence. Collector Heustls refused per
mission for the v.essel to enter, and she
was detained pending advice from San
Francisco,- which is her home port. Cap
tain Hansen fears- that his vessel is
"hoodooed," through the sensational
events of the last voyage, but conditions
indicate that other causes may have been
at the bottom of the unaccountable
deaths. Among the papers presented by
the E. K. Wood at the Custom-house is
one written in French from. the Consular
Agent in Taiphong, and as yet this has
not been translated. This official is alleged
to have retained the crew list which is
missing, and a translation - of , the docu
ment in the foreign tongue is being await
ed with interest. Dispatches received to
night from Port Townsend state that the
Wood has at last been released and has
proceeded to* Whatcom to load.
The E. K. Wood, with another vessel,
\yras in tow of a tug when John Wells, a
seaman, sprang over: the side and struck
out for the other vessel astern. He was
drowned before he could reach it.
TACOMA, Aug. 20.â Whether a hoodoo
or something worse Is responsible for ex
isting conditions aboard the schooner E.
K. Wood is the question here, following
the arrival of that vessel at Port Town
send from a trip with cargo to Talphong,
China. - Whatever it is,, the vessel has
been detained by the customs officers and
two of the men who shipped on her for
the outward journey are at the bottom of
the Pacific. - The 'first is averred to have
committed suicide Before the vessel was
well started.

ATJDUBON BOY WINS
BIG NORFOLK STAKES
For a time this evening there was a
mild wrangle among the golfers as to the
proper time for playing of the finals In the
big tournament in which C. E. Maud will
meet â¢ H. M. Sears. Maud, it seems, is a
crack polo player and will play with the
Southern team In the match game to
morrow afternoon. Naturally enough he
wished to play the final match at golf
to-morrow forenoon. To this Mr. Sears
objected. The matter was laid before a
committee and matters were amicably
arranged by the two contestants agreeing
to play twenty-seven holes before the
noon hour arid the other nine after
.luncheon. . .
The fiualifying round in the ladies'
tournament. In which the noted rivals.
Mrs R -Gili-nan Brown and Miss Caro
Crockett, will again clash, will open to
morrow.
lost to Hubbard 1 up in nineteen holes.
While playing good golf, Fred Stratton
found 8eara. too warm company, going
down by a score of 5 up and 4 to play.
After the lunah hour play was resumed
with Maud and Wilshlfe first up at the
tee. The former outplayed his opponent,
scoring 7 up and 4 to play. Hubbard made
a bold bid asrainst Sears, but gave It up
at the fifth hole, all chance being gone,
Sears winning by C up and 4 to play.

arms. The- ladies and gentlemen as 'well
acquire them at the. golf links, and the
men pull down. their sleeves when they
get Indoors, whereas the ladies wear el
bow sleeve afternoon gowns and sleeve
less dinner dresses, and thus display at all
times- the rounded nutbrown arms. Not
a speck of powder may be used, and If the
arms contrast with the evening, dress,
even to' the point of black and white, so
much. the. better. Tanned, cheeks, how
ever, are no longer permissible, and a
freckle on the nose of a patrician is pun
ishable by ostracism. To keep well within
the bounds and have the face fair and
spotless thfck chiffon veils are continually
worn. The ladles come down to breakfast
with thelr t heavy veils tied round their
hats and hanging loosely round.their faces
like. a silken curtain. Some.'iadlps go a
step further In the matter of'vells and
wear two. Mrs. Carolan plays the double
face curtain game, a dotted spidery mpsh
tied tightly and a black dotted chiffon
falling loosely over It. Mrs. -.Will Crocker
Is also a follower of the two-veil' fashion,
whereas her sister, the Princess. Ponla
towski, boldly defies fashion, and wears
no veil at all. The Princess is the hap
piest looking woman down here. While
she Is upsetting fashionable decrees in the
matter of veils the Prince is breaking
rules in the auestion of trousers. He is
the. only man at Del Monte excepting the
crack players from the southland, who
Â¦wears unmentionables and not "knickers"
and leggings. It is hard to understand
how the Prince does it. for he lives inane
very midst of splendid examples.

sturdy yet shapely calves set off by. solid
gray. hosiery, and Brother-in-law Charles.
Alexander goes in for plnhead checked

of a showing. -Miss Alice Hager' probably
does more real work than all theother

each of her favorite sports a fair share of
attention. If if came to a matter of .de

Miss Hager would stand more than a fair
chance to win. Last evening she wore a
black tulle evening- 'gowns, all a-glltter
with blackest .let. Her sleeves were
elbow length and the rounded arms thus
exposed showed up good and dark in spite
of the setting of her black gown.
Miss Mary Eyre, a neat little figure in
her mourning gowns, is by ;far the most
graceful wheelwoman here. Miss .Tolllffe
goes Tn considerably for the bicycle, and.

Nothing very startling in the way of
gowns has appeared a,s yet. The ladies,
rumor goes, are keeping their most stun
ning creations for the latter part- of the
week. The handsomest gown that has
been seen thus far was without doubt the
white; lace dreso worn by Mrs. Carolan
last evening. Mrs. Carolan has grown
extremely thin since her recent Illness,
but it Is not thinness that is unbecoming.
She is graceful and willowy, and if her
face is pale her eyes appear^all the
blacker and her hair all the more dark

"Kid" McFaddcn was given the decision
over George Baker. Referee. Ed Smith an

was the aggressor. It was a close de

his punches he could have badly damaged
his opponent! Baker showed more speed
and was much cleverer with his work, but
McFadden's â¢ hammer and tongs - method
won the referee; The boiit was a satis

the shutting down is to give the plant a

plant is now under consideration. How
long the plant will be shut down I do not
know. There is no shortage at the Argen

' thority of the Superintendent.
NOTEâ The high and low waters occur at
the city front (Mission-street wharf) about
twenty-five minutes later than at Fort Point;
the height of. tide is the same at both places.
Good resolutions come under the head of
self-binders.
Mrs. Charles Haydon of Metropole. 111.,
the only woman saved. Is badly bruised.
The whereabouts of Mr. Hogan. husband
of one of the women, and the three chil
dren drowned is unknown, j He is a travel
ing man from St. Louis. <
This afternoon the bodies of Miss Gra
ham and Mrs. "W. A. Hogan and Lucille,
her six-year-old daughter, were recovered.
The position of the limbs and the expres
sion on the face, as well as scratches and
bruises, indicated a fierce struggle when
the prisoners- were caught in the little
cabin like rats. The boat is being dis
mantled in order that the dead may be
reached. . .
Early this morning the work of search
ing for the remains began, the party be
ing led by Charles Graham, County Clerk,
and Luther Graham, his brother, whose
sister was 'among the dead. Three bodies
were recovered in the forenoonâ those of
Miss Trixie Grimes. Miss Lucy Barnett
and Mrs. David Adams. Miss Barnett's
face was badly lacerated.
Frank Enders, one of the passengers,
corroborated by several others, declares
that the effort to land brought the side
of the boai around so that the wind
struck it with full force. There had been
almost a gale blowing for ten minutes
and one man who could not swim went
to, the pilot-house and begged the pilot to
land. When he did finally consent to land
the hurricane struck the boat as it swung
around in a position least able to resist it.
A. A. Peck, the pilot," says the engineer
deserted his post and that he could not
manage the boat with the engines help
less. The engineer denies this and asserts
that he remained at the throttle until the
water was waist deep.
The boat's register has not yet been re
covered, but it is certain the death list
will number seventeen and perhaps twen
ty-two. An official investigation will be
made, as it seems that the most culpable
carelessness caused the castastrophe.

"Water Front Notes.
Three people were injured in a street
car collision on the water front yesterday.
The horse car tender of the Presidio ca
ble line left ihe ferries about 10 a. m. and
had the right of way to Jackson street.
The Mission-street electric line came down
Broadway and turning into East street
made for the ferries at a high rate of
Fpeed. As it reached Jackson street the
Presidio horse car was just swinging on
the curve. It did not pass quickly enough,
however, and the electric car struck the
rear end, smashing all the windows,
throwing the driver off the platform and
injuring two of the lady passengers. The
latter were cut by the flying glass, but
the driver. A. Michaels, was taken to the
Harbor Hospital, where he was treated
for a contusion of the ; forehead and a
laceration of the right eye.
The Presidio car was No. IS and Mich
aels is the regular driver. The electric
car was No. 1170 and was running as an
extra in charre of an extra crew. The
men on the electric car assert that the
track was slippery and that the car

STSEETCAES IN COLLISION.
THE French bark Marechal de Vil
lars arrived from Hongkong yes
terday in almost steamboat time.
She made the run in 38 days, a
record that has not been beaten
In ten years. Away back in 1890 the Amer
ican ship William H. Macy made the voy
asre in 24 days, and since then vessels of
every nationalitj* have tried at the record,
but the run of the Marechal de Villars is
the only one that comes near the mark.
Captain Francisco Hionel of the Mare
-~4"ral de Villars considers he has the fast
est vessel in port to-day and is willing: to
wager that he will lead the grain fleet
home. The bark is only three years old
and is now on her second voyage. On her
first run she went from Cardiff to Port
land and on the run back to Europe made
the voyage in 97 days. After discharging
she loaded again at Cardiff for Hongkong
ar.d after discharging there came to San
Francisco in ballast.
"We left Hongkong July 13 and for the
first two days had strong northeast
winds." said Captain Rionel yesterday.
"Then for four or five days we had fine
southwest winds and off the Japanese
coast we average 240 miles a day. When
we ran with the Japan current we had
ehangeabl* breezes and only logged 139
miles a day. We -went north on the Great
Circle and between 44 degrees and 47 de
grees north we had magnificent southerly
breezes that took us along at steamship
time. For several days 'we made fifteen
miles an hour, but a week ago the wind
died away and between August 12 and 14
we only made twelve knots a day. Then
a strong northeast wind blew and with
th? topgallant sails in and the mainsail
reefed we made 342 miles in twenty-four
hours. On the 19th inst.. at 7 a. m.. we
were off Point Arena and at 8 p. m. the
same day we passed Point Reyes. From
Point Reyes the pilot brought us into
port. The Marechal â¢ de Villars is char
tered to load wheat for Europe and I ex
pect to make a record run home."
The bark Montebelle, now in port, and
La Bruyere and Marechal de Turenne.
due here any day. all fly the same flag
as the Marechal de Villars and all are
consigned to Roth. Blum & Co. This Is
Captain Rionels third visit to this coast.
He has a host of friends in the French

FROGSâ T. M. H., Vallejo, Cal. In the
United States the bullfrog Is cultivated
for food. In Europe the kind cultivated
is the common green frog. - There the
frogs are caught in great numbers in nets
and placed In large Inclosed ponds called
froggeries, where the little animals are
fed until wanted for the table. The prin
cipal food of the frogs is insects, but
when In froggeries they are also fed with
bread crumbs and chopped meat. The
flesh of the frog is best in the fall. Â«

PERSONAL MENTION.
-râÂ» REDERIC W. HOLLS, one of the representa
rH tives of the United States on the Hague Court
A of Arbitration, is reported to have stated re
cently that the outlook for prolonged peace among
the great nations is excellent, and that the powers
are gradually coming to recognize the possible use
fulness of the tribunal which the famous peace con
ference established to arbitrate disputes that might
otherwise lead to war.
It is gratifying to have this announcement. There
was danger th*at so far from recognizing the useful
ness of the High -Court of Nations the world might
forget it altogether, and not even know it by name.
It is a common belief among Americans that an in
stitution which does no work soon falls into decay
and is brushed aside as so much rubbish. Mr. Holls,
however, is of the opinion that The Hague court
is an exception to that rule, if it be a rule. He is
quoted as saying virtually that it matters not that the
court has had little or no business to attend to; the
essential point is that it is organized, open and 'ready
for business as soon as any business comes along.
That of course is a pleasant view to take of it,
but we fear the powers are not recognizing the pos
sible utility of the court as fully as Mr. Holls
imagines. There is a great deal of bad busi
ness now going on in the world which might be con
verted into good business by the. court if only its pos
sibilities could obtain just recognition from the
powers that created it For example, there is the
Chinese indemnity question that might afford a great
deal of genuine work on the part of the tribunal were
it submitted to that body with power to act.
Of course the possible utility of the tribunal is in
disputable. Had the British Government, for ex
ample, submitted the South African dispute to ar
bitration B-itain would have emerged from it without
loss and with an honorable name. By refusing to do
so she has involved herself in a struggle which has
cost her many thousands of brave men and an ex
penditure of money which will be a debt and a bur
den upon her people for many a year to come.
It k of course possible that other great powers
may profit by the warning of the British experience
in South Africa, but it is not at all probable that they
will. Russia will not submit the Manchurian question
to arbitration, nor would any other great power un
der similar circumstances be more respectful to the
High Court at The Hague. It will have recognition
as an ornamental institution bestowed upon the world
by the Czar of Russia, and wijl be treated with the
deference due to its august origin, but as for giving
it any important work to do, that is another thing.
The one ray of hope that illumines the court is that
it may get at least enough work to do to show its
possible utility. Wars have now become too costly
for human endurance. The burdens put upon the
nations of Europe to maintain their armaments even
upon a peace footing are about as heavy as the tax
payers can endure. That they would gladly support
the principle and the practice of international arbi
tration if an appeal could be taken to their sober
judgment is beyond dispute. It happens, however,
that such appeals have to be made when a nation
is bent on war and glory, and with the jingo spirit
aroused there is no use talking of peaceful solutions.
The Hague court will be a long time waiting for big
business.
BRITISH military authorities have an army
canteen problem' ; u'nder discussion which,
while radically different from our own, is none
the less interesting and may be instructive. It is not
with them a question whether the canteen shall con
tinue, but one of ways and means of conducting it in
such a way as to prove most beneficial to the indi
vidual soldier and to the army at large.
It appears from the London Chronicle that in the
past there have been grave abuses resulting from the
peculiar manner in which the military canteens have
been conducted. In a recent review of the subject
it says: "As is perfectly well known, they have
hitherto been liable to serious abuses. The British
soldier has been robbed that contractors may make
fortunes, and non-commissioned officers pocket
bribes "in the shape of presents, secret rebates, dis
counts and other unfair forms of profit. Temptations
are continually offered by large firms to canteen stew
ards, and there is no code of honor strong enough to
keep the stewards from yielding. In very many, if
not in most cases, they become accomplices with the
contractors in taking money o'ut of. their comrades'
pockets." : Â»Â¦â¢'â¢.
No such complaint -as that Was ever made of the
American canteen system even by its most irrespon
sible opponent, and it will be surprising to many
Americans to learn that abuses of that kind could
have existed even under the British service. Some
thing like ten years ago Major Lionel Fortescue, who
was recently, killed in South Africa, took the man
agement of the canteen of his regiment into his. own
hands, and within a year eradicated the old abuses
and established a model upon which reforms are now
being undertaken throughout the army.
In describing the plan of the proposed reform the
Chronicle says: "On the strength of his success
Major Fortescue assisted Major Crauford, late of the
Grenadier Guards, to establish the Canteen and Mess
Co-operative Society, which first began its work at
Caterham. The War Oflice has discouraged . the
society as it discourages everything new and most
things that can be of advantage to the soldier. But
in spite of that the society'has developed rapidly, and
in the first four years of^its. existence its turnover
grew to Â£150,000. Shareholders are rfot allowed to
hold more than Â£200 s piece, and their interest is lim
ited to a maximum of 5 per cent. It is hoped to abol
ish private shareholders altogether and to make the
regimental institutes the members, so that the society
might become the sole property of .those institutes,
the profits being shared entirely among the con
sumers." . ,
This plan of turning. the canteen 'into a co
operative association. is in line with the present co
operative tendencies which, are so marked among all
classes of the British people. The Chronicle claims
it would be of enormous advantage not only to the
soldier but to the country, if all, the canteens in the
army were managed on these co-operative and'profit
sharing principles, under the direction of a central
committee composed of officers who have an interest
in the welfare of the soldier.
It will . be seen that with the British there is no
thought of abolishing the canteen. The authorities
seem to be 'agreed, that even with all the old abuses
it is better to have the army canteen than to leave
the soldier to the enticements of the outside grog
shops Â¦ ..'*.' - Â¦ ; â¢ :

MUCH anxiety has been caused In London by the discov
ery that the foundations of St. Paul's Cathedral are
. sinking and that the great structure has been cracked
In many places. Somers Clarke, the architect, who has
charge of St. Paul's, in discussing the matter recently,
said: "The immense weight resting upon the eight piers uphold
ing the dome has caused the foundations under the dome to
settle more than elsewhere. The settlement thus caused has
broken the eight arches and the windows of the clerestory over
them in the nave of the choir and the north and south transepts
where they abut on the dome piers In the same way.
. "The very great weight of the western towers has caused
them to sink, and in sinking they have cracked the Â¦west front !
vertically thrqugh the great door, the window above and the
vaulted ceiling of the portico. They have also cracked the wall
of the chapel to the east." :Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦':
After mentioning the unequal distribution of weight as a.
cause of the settlement, Mr. Clarke expressed the opinion that
the two underground railways and the large sewers have af
fected the foundations. He laid particular stress upon the
vibrations resulting from the passing trains. - ij

A N observant student of affairs in England has
ZA recently written for the New York Post a re
Â¦*Â¦ *Â¦ view of the changes that have been brought
about in that country during the last forty years.
Many of these changes he attributes to the presence
and influence of Americans, whose numbers in Eng
land are rapidly increasing.
In some respects the writer resents the intrusion
of the American, whose desire for sightseeing has
set a fashion among the British themselves, so that
now all the lovely spots in the island are overrun.
He says: "The famous seat of the 'lake poets/ Cum
berland and Westmoreland, is so overcrowded with
tourists that the road through the mountains seems
to be leading to a 'fair; the small steamers on'the
lakes are^ crowded to their utmost capacity. *. Un-'
happy is the place which has some touch of Ameri
canism in its history. The railroads dump on it
thousands of our countrymen, who poke their noses
everywhere, cut chips off every wooden memorial,
apply, the hammer- to every- stone one, and almost
compel the inhabitants to move out." '' . '"â¢"Â¦
The rush of sightseeing Americans, however, has
not been without its good results. The demand for
accommodations suitable to American desires has led
to an immense improvement in railway carriages and
hotels. The writer says: "The old cabined, cribbed,
confined tavern, consisting of a private house fitted
up as an inn, has almost disappeared, and new hotels
on 'the American plan' are springingup everywhere."
Social changes have followed the inroad of Ameri
cans with their ideas of equality, but the British pub
lic is still a long way short of the American level.
In fact, the writer thinks that a good many American
millionaires and other dignitaries go to England
solely to enjoy the deference with which they are re
ceived. He says: "It is well known what small
force titles h&ye in America, how little account Amer
icans make of Judges, Archdeacons and Bishops. In
England these are all great personages, and I have
heard an American Bishop give \ most impressive
account of a sensation he made at Westminster Hall
by driving up in an English Bishop's carriage. So,
in like manner, the millionaire, who -receives 7 but
small honor in the United States, if, indeed, he is not
looked on with suspicion, becomes a stupendous
character 'when he lands in Liverpool or Southamp
ton. The American who in any profession enjoys
ever so slight" a distinction at home has little idea
what a great man he is until he' comes to England."
Doubtless it is that deference to rank and wealth
on the part of the British public which induces a
good many Americans to take up their homes there.
Such people 'are no great loss to us and they seem
to be a good deal of benefit to England. They im
prove her hotels and railways and give her a livelier*
movement in the way of right progress. They there
fore serve a better purpose there than they could do
at home, so after all the American in England may
be the right sort of man in the right place.
AMERICANS IN ENGLAND.
WISDOM has seemed to dictate, up to this
time, that the press should avoid discussion
of the many, intricate issues that are in
volved in the destructive strike that is inflicting in
jury upon this city and State.
This attitude is no longer possible on account of
the incendiary course adopted by the Examiner. Not
warned by experience, it is repeating the inflamma
tory tactics which it adopted in the railroad strike
of 1894, by which it led a large number of men into
serious trouble. and caused to them and their fami
lies prolonged distress.
; In such a situation as now exists in this city it is
not wise to heat the temper of either side of the con
troversy, for, when heated, things are said and done
which make the contestants more irreconcilable. As
its excuse for casting off all reserve the Examiner
invented a lie about Mr. Frank Symmes, which was
proved a lie by its own witnesses, but served as a
pretext for its subsequent course. It has daily pub
lished personal attacks upon the owner of The Call,
with the transparent* motive of benefiting its own
subscription list, at the expense of ours. For that
the owner of The Call cares nothing. He is no
stranger to personal attacks and supports them with
philosophy, especially when made by Mr. Hearst,
whose sole relation to the industries and the morals
of California has been the vicious injury of the one
and the debauchery of the other.
The owner of The Call, individually and in his
connection with many industrial and business enter
prises, is a' large employer of labor. The thousands
of wage-workers who have worked for him are under
no restraint that prevents them making any. statement
they choose about his relations or the fairness of his
conduct toward them. With this let the^personal
phase be, for the present, dismissed, while we ex
amine the advice given by the Examiner and those
who hold, with it to the wage-earners who are idle
while there is work for them all to do if they will.
Over and over again,., as the basis of its argument,
the statement is made that labor has the same right
as capital to combine, and the labor union is in
sisted upon as the analogue of the corporation. We
grant both premises. They arc undeniable. Surely
neither The Call as a newspaper nor its owner as a
large employer has ever denied them.'* Admitting
them freely, we say to those who stand for them that
the analogy between the organization of capital and
labor cannot cease with their right to organize, but
must continue to equality of responsibility.
Capital combines and incorporates, but no cor
poration compels any one to join and purchase its
stock, by depriving him of the means of earning his
bread if he refuse. It pickets no banker's door, nor"
business man's store, to denounce him to passers-by
or customers who seek to patronize 'him. It does
not enforce investment in its securities by calling
those who refuse "scabs." It can do none of these
things because the power for harm of organization
being recognized, organized capital is hedged around
by the law, and everything capital does is under the
shadow and restraint of its legal responsibility. On
the streets of this city may be seen trucks and drays
with a printed placard reading, "Granted permission
by the B. O. T." This means that some one has
need of a wage-worker, and that the employer can
not have the services of the employe until a third
party' who neither earns the wages nor pays them
"grants permission."
Suppose that a truck were seen placarded, "Granted
permission to work by the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company," that company being neither the earner
nor the payer of the wages, does not every one know
that not only would the whole town rise in revolt,
but the courts would take instant cognizance of the
offense against personal liberty and â¢ punish the
offender? Yet an act that capital dare not do is done
by an organization that has neither legal standing
nor financial responsibility.
Labor has the same right to organize as capital.
We go farther than that and declare that labor has a
better right to organize than capital, because men are
more important than money. But, when organized,
labor escapes none- of its obligations to the com
munity of which it is a part. It has no more right
than capital to stop all industry and inflict an irre
parable injury upon production as is now being
done. If the corporations of California were doing
as the Examiner is now encouraging union labor to
do the courts would oust them from the control of
their business, and under the legal principle of the
failure of a trust by default of the trustee would, by
judicial order, install trustees who. would proceed to
discharge their corporate obligations.
If it be insisted that individual contract between
employer and employe shall cease, and that the em
ploye surrendering that right shall merge himself in
a union, "surrendering his personal liberty of con
tract, to work only when granted permission by the
officers of his union, the safety of the laborer him
self demands that such potent and portentous con
trol of his fate shall be responsible and not irrespon
sible, that its power for evil shall be recognized as
well as its power for good, and that its exercise shall
be as rigidly regulated by law as is the power of capi
tal and of corporations.
The welfare of the wage-worker himself requires
this. Thousands of men are now idle in this, city and
their families are feeling the pinch who were with

not put under any ban .as union men. They .had
union wages and hours, but they are refused permis
sion to work because third parties refuse to grant
permission to wage-earners to work in some . other
line of employment. Such men are denied the right
to keep their contracts and agreements with their
employers and compelled to. stand impeached of bad
faith -because of a controversy they did not cause
and cannot settle.
In the absence of any legal status or responsibility
they find themselves compelled to resort to the primi
tive method of force to prevent the community, of
which they are a part, continuing the processes by
which its life is maintained. As they feel the pinch
worse and their condition becomes more desperate

in denying to others the right to do the work and
take the wages they have abandoned. .; , â¢

of the Examiner in search of nickels'. It is teaching
the wage-earners that they have.no responsibility to
the community, that the ships may rot at the
wharves, the farmers' grain and fruit waste, in the
fields, and the commerce and industries of the 'State
migrate permanently elsewhere, to the lasting injury
of both labor and capital, "for the sake of a prin
ciple," which involves the right of a third party to
grant or refuse to men the right to work when-em
ployment is waiting for them. No question of hours
or wages is involved, only .this "principle," which 'is

personal liberty, that it cannpt safely be intrusted to

The bull was 1; â no hurry to act. He
stood and leisurely surveyed the situa
tion. A knot of people who imagined they
were far enough away from him to be
safe was the first thing to catch his eye
and at them he charged. "Where those
people went to is still puzzling the police,
though Captain Dunleavy. is willing to
wager that many a resident of Oakland
got home without having his ticket
punched.
Evidently satisfied that he could do just
about as he pleased the bull took another
look. This time he spied a gang of
strikers, and the way he scattered that
expert ana the commuters had that his
bullship was anything but a real nice ani
mal was a loud snort and a vicious yank
at the rope by which the vaquero was
leading him. That one yank at the rope
was enough for the man from* butcher

made the hundreds of commuters sorry
ithat they had- ncj caught the 5 o'clock

longshoremen who have helped handle her
cargo on former trips since, the strike
began did not put in an appearance â¢ They
were not acting under orders -from their

accord that they would not work. An
effort was made to get non-union Mexi
cans to assist the crew in handling the
cargo, but they demanded 45 cents an
hour instead of 35 cents and the steamship
officers concluded to get along without
them. So the crew went to work unload

left for the north at 9:30 to-night having
discharged 150 tons of freight during the
day and taken on a like amount.

Captain Wittman stated .that he had
been informed that the gamblers were
playing roulette, and it was due to this
report that he raided the place. As he
could not' find the "wheel" or other evi

visitors, he Â¦was unable to make arrests^

an official visit to the crap game that ha*
been running in full blast at 145 Powell

unexpected and the gamblers who crowd
ed the room, behind the cigar stand were
thrown into a panic. Every effort was
made to escape Â¦ from the premises, but
the doors and exits were guarded by po
licemen.
The raid wa3 well planned. Captain
Wittman, Sergeant O'Connor and a po
liceman left the Hall of -Justice in citi

that has seen service in breaking up Chi

The executive committee of the San
Francisco Labor Council gave out the fol
lowing address to the farmers of the State
last night:
To the Farmers of Californiaâ Brothers: As
you are aware we, your fellow tollers, are en
gaged In this city of San Francisco in a strug
gle for our rights. This struggle has not only
affected the local trade of this city, but it
has also affected the transportation of those
staples in which you are interested. You are
suffering no less than we. It is therefore of
importance that you should thoroughly under
stand the nature of the present struggle in
order that you may be able to place on the
proper shoulders the responsibility for the in
jury which is done you.
Thig is the more necessary now because our
enemies and yours are straining every nerve
to throw the blame on us. They have money
and with money they hope to manufacture pub
lic opinion against our cause and yours. "Di
vide and conquer" is their motto and if they
can divide us who are brethren and fellow
soldiers their victory will be easy and -lasting.
Therefore we are anxious that you be not led
away by their misrepresentations, but that you
know the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth.
In the beginning let us ask you to consider
Â¦who -are likely to be your friends, the cap
italists or we. Tou belong to the great army
of the tollers, bo do we. You are exploited by
usurers and capitalists, eo are we. You are
the plain people who have nothing but a vote
to set .in this government Â¦ against those who
can buy officials, corrupt legislatures and pur
chase courts. We are in the same class with
you. Who then are likely to be your friendsâ
the men of the same class with you or the
men who look upon you as chattels? We must
be true to you, for our cause is your cause,
our welfare your welfare, our honor your
honor. Those who are fighting us cannot be
true to you, for everything that make's them
what they are ! Is precisely that which op
presses you and defrauds you of your rights.
When, then, they come to you with fair
seeming words it is your duty to be cautious
and to look before you leap. We no doubt
have our faults and many of them, but we are
convinced in this case that knowledge of the
facts will show you that we have done noth
ing to demand excuse.
Why is this strike now on? It is not a
strike, but a lockout. We are not asking for
shorter hours or higher pay. Why then is all
transportation tied up?
. Our enemies say It 13 "cussedness," and for
once they are right. The strike is caused by
the "cussedness" of a few rich men in San
Francisco who have organized themselves Into
a secret society called the Employers' Asso
ciation. That society Is a mercantile Malta
which has decreed that labor unions must be
assassinated. They demand that we dissolve
those brotherhoods and federations' which have
done so much to better our condition. While
they are linked together" with band3 of brass,
they demand that the worldngmen come to
them singly hat In hand, to receive whatever
treatment their tyranny may condescend to
grant. . ..-.-.Â¦
Farmers of California, what would you say
to any combination of men that would forbid
you to organize to safeguard your rights?
Would it not be better for you - to see your
fields untilled, to suffer .the pangs of hunger,
to hear the cry of your little ones, rather than
sell your manhood for a mess of pottage?
There are rights which are dearer than life
Itself, and the right to organize for mutual
help, the right to stretch out the hand to help
In bearing one -another's burdens, is one -of
them. This right Is one of the essentials of
liberty, and our forefathers were fired to vin
dicate their freedom with their blood by that
Important apostrophe, "Give me liberty or give
me death.". This is the right the Employers'
Association would deny us In San Francisco.
Is it not our duty and the duty of every free
American citizen to suffer all things rather
than surrender it? Thi3 strike is not our doing
We gave no occasion for It. The employers
wantonly forced it on us. We begged for
your sake that they would make some arrange
ment by which the wheat might be moved
â¢we pleaded with them; we set aside for a mo
ment our Just pride to pray them to remember
your. case, and what was their answer? "Let
It rot!"
And now they would persuade you that we
are to blame. This whole city that is in sym
pathy with us knows our hands are clean. I The
employers are drunk with prosperity and pride
They have profaned the temple of liberty, and'
like the impious king of old, they have brought
forth the sacred vessels to defile them. Let
them see now over against them the finger
still writing on the wall: "Ye are weighed in
the balance and ye are found wanting."-
We are sincerely .yours, by order of the Exe
cutive Committee of the San. Francisco Labor
Council. W. HV GOFF. President. 4 -,
ED ROSENBERG, Secretary.

DIMMICK'S BAIL
HIDE LIGHTER
The bull was being led \ along East
street toward the San Jose steamer land
ing at a time when all the commuters
were doing the usual break-neck act for
the boat. He gave no sign of the spirit
that worked within him until just opposite
the ferry- He was apparently such a Oo
cile bovine that the man from the land
of strong odors who was leading him
thought he was the nicest bull that ever
started on a voyage to a slaughter-house.
The first intimation the butchertown
wharves than a rumor of a iiot
could create. It was not one of Captain
Dunleavy's "bulls" that broke loose, but
one of the real things imported from
butchertown. If the harbor police could
only scatter a crowd like that four-legged
animal there would be little need for the
appointment of "scab" policemen. .
A BULL broke loose on the water
front last night about 6 o'clock
and for more than an hour there
was more excitement about the
Tiring of attacking the denizens of tha
ferry in crowds the bull started for them
individually. Men, women and children,
safely ensconced as they thought behind
the pillars of the ferry building, wore
driven from behind the protective blocks
of granite and compelled to dart hither
and thither to escape the animal.
Even a bull gets tired, however, and this
particular animal luckily got tired quick
ly. When he had driven every one oft
the street he let out a roar, flashed a last
look of contempt around the ferry and,
then settled back on his haunches for a
rest. The last seen of the bull he was
on board the boat to which he was bcln<?
led when the fit of anger overtook him
The vaquero who'had him In charge, after
making a detour of several blocks, man
aged to get up close enough to grasp the
leading rope. The rest was easy, for the
bull having, had , his fun* was perfectly
willing to be led aboard the boat.
crowd brought tears to the eyes of every
police officer on the front.
Mr. J. W. Andrews of Hopland killed a
fine deer near Largo, a short distance
north of Hopland, and Mr. Sevenoaks of
the San Francisco Post killed one buck
off Duncan's Peak, which overshadows
Duncan's Springs. Mr. George W. Grant
and party went up last week to Round
Valley and got eight.
Quite a number of the guests at Hand
ley's Summer Resort, which Is on the
Orr's Springs road, twenty miles west of
Ukiah, have a number of bucks to their
credit. In addition to the four shot last
â¢week by them, Mr. Wade H. Foulks of

Mr. Frank Valencia, who lives at
Igrr.acio, killed in the hills two deer, one
on August 11 and one on August IS. Mr.
"W. J. B. Mills and party from San Fran-
Cisco got two deer last Thursday and one
on Saturday near Novato. On Sunday
Mr. W. Devoto killed one near Black
Point.
It has been truly said that the best
hunting left In California easily available
to those living In San Francisco and
vicinity Is in Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino
ar.d Lake counties. At no time in the past
have deer been more plentiful than at
present, nor is their presence confined to
any one locality. They seem to be every
where throughout that section.

I won t say any more about Jt. except
that I was offered $1(KK) to let the defense
(Arbuckles) have the jury and later was
offered another thousand to take the case
away from the jury."
"Who were the people who came to see
you?" was asked of Judge Mack. He
named three well-known Toledoans under
the condition that their names were not
to be published yet.
"I'll not allow their names published
until I get ready to defend myself. Then
1*11 let the public know who is "crooked."
Later came another sensational feature
of the case. Clarence Brown of the coun
sel for the Arbuckles vigorously denied
Mack's statements, practically giving him
the lie straight and declared that he
(Brown) was approached with a proposi
tion to the effect that a disagreement of
the Jury could be secured for a consider
ation.
TOLEDO. O.. Aug. 20.â Bad blood has
Frown out of the Arbuckle-Havemeyer
coffee war controversy in the courts. Re
cently in Judge Mack's court many ex
perts from all over the country were ex
amined In the case where the State Dairy
and Food Commissioner of. Ohio had ar
rested grocers for selling a brand of Ar
liuckle's package coffee. The test case oc
cupied days and weeks. It did not mat
ler which side won, the case was bound
to go to a higher court. Attorneys have
been trying to induce Judge Mack to sign
a bill of exceptions, but he has decided to
take his own time to it.
To-day In a heated controversy some
sensational charges were preferred by
both Judge and attorneys. The Judge
had been mandamused In a suit to compel
him to Elgn a journal entrv. Clarence
Brown. Thomas Tracy and H. A. Bod
man called upon the Judge but he refused
to signHhe bill of exceptions. Arbuckle's
attorneys held a consultation. Then they
attacked Judge Mack in a body with a
fire of hot argument. The Judge sudden
ly exclaimed:

The Democratic Socialists Â¦ will have a
convention of their own and will also have
a party designation on the official ballot,
as they elected the following delegates at
the recent primary election:
All the politicians know that a labor
ticket usually plays havoc with the Demo
cratic machine. The Workingmen's party
of 1S77-78 almost extinguished the Democ
racy in San Francisco. The workingmen
elected the municipal officers excepting
the Board of Supervisors. The Republi
cans elected the Governor and other State
officers, including the Legislature. Re
publican Supervisors were also elected in
San Francisco. The Democrats were
practically erased from the political map.
As soon as the- Workingmen's party was
fairly established the Democrats began to
break in. When the party dissolved the
Democrats went back to -their old love.
Democrats Fear Labor picket.
Supervisor Charles Wesley Reed, who
represents a Jeffersonlan faction in the
Democratic party and is a shining light in
the aristocratic Monticello Club, is spoken
of as a candidate for Mayor on the Labor
ticket.
The convention will consist of 400 dele
gates. The shoemakers, stablemen and
barbers have chosen their delegates. The
convention will meet in Metropolitan
Temple September 5.

There will be a labor ticket in the field,

to suit himself. He suggests that the

his name at the head of the ticket he
would accept the honor and responsibility
of leadership and use all honorable efforts
to achieve success.
Wells "Would Accept Nomination.
Charles W. Slack, r formerly . Superior
Judge, and at present Regent of the Uni
versity of California, is not a candidate
for Mayor of San Francisco. He was
asked yesterday on behalf of The Call if
there were any conditions under which he
would accept the Republican nomination
for Mayor. Ha frankly replied that he"
did not know of any conditions which
would induce him to take the nomination.
He remarked: "My reason for saying that
I afn not a candidate for Mayor and
would not accept a nomination for the
office is simple. If I accepted the nomi
nation It would be disastrous to my busi
ness. If my election followed acceptance
it. would be destructive to my business. I
have worked to gather up a practice and
succeeded to some degree. I am a poor
man and cannot afford to give up my
practice."
The politicians who are talking of plac
ing Judge Slack at tha, head of the Re
publican ticket should turn their atten
tion elsewhere. He is out of politics and
proposes to stay .out. ,

A PESTIFEROUS GERM.
Burrows T7p the Scalp Into Dandruff
and Saps tlie Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair aa
a rule do not know that it is the result of
dandruff, which Is caused by a pestiferous
parasite burrowing up the scalp as it digs
down to the sheath in which the hair is
fed in the scalp. Before long the hair root
Js shriveled up and the hair drops out.
If the work of the germ is not destroyed
hair keeps thinning till baldness comes
The only way to cure dandruff is to kill
the germ, end until now there has been
no hair preparation that would do 5t. But
to-day dandruff is easily eradicated by
JCewbro's Herpicide, which makts hair
glossy and soft as silk.

NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â The stock market
was somewhat broader and more active' to-day,
but there was still no evidence of any large
participation in the market by the general
public or by great financial interests . on a
large 6cale. These questionable positions of
the United States Steel stocks and the doubt
ful outlook for the labor situation are still
a drag on the market, although the market for
the United States Steel stocks themselves and
the price movement are narrow. The market
guardians of the stocks show themselves amply
able to take charge of all the stock offered,
cnowing that the company's shares have come
to be closely held. But the supporters of the
stocks are inclined to take profits on holdings
thus acquired' on any advance in price and
they bid up the prices when anything like
an outside demand develops for the stocks.
Under these artificial conditions the movements
of the stock have little significance. The gen
eral list showed a disposition to-day to ignore
the steel stocks. The railroads concerned in
the Northern' Pacific settlements and others
allied by Identical ownership or otherwise re
sumed the leadership of the market, to-day.
This may have been based on a public report
of a prolonged conference yesterday at Bar
Harbor between the three- financiers who con
ducted the Northern Pacific, contest and its
settlement. The Morgan and Harriman roads
were generally affected in sympathy. Includ
ing Illinois Central, Chicago and Alton, South
ern Railway and Chicago, Indianapolis and
Louisville. The anthracite carriers manifested
some strength and the bituminous coal car
riers made gains although Norfolk and West
ern and Chesapeake and Ohio suffered from
profit-taking. A sharp decrease in earnings of
Norfolk and Western for the second week In
August eoemed to emphasize this disposition
Some large individual blocks of Southern Pa
cific, Union Pacific and St.- Paul were taken
in the last hour and those stocks rose 19i@l%
over last night. The stock market continued
to' show sensitiveness Â¦ to developments In the
money and exchange market. A sharp recov
ery In sterling exchange this morning led to
some reaction from the opening strength in
stocks. Offerings of wheat bills were reported
emaller in connection with reports of smaller
seaboard wheat clearances which caused a re
action in the wheat market. But this influence
was largely offset by the. large . receipts on
account of Australian gold deposited at San
Francisco.. The sub- treasury's debit balance
at the clearing-house of $l,S52,S02 was caused
by the receipt of checks against gold on the
Pacific Coast to the amount of $1,400 000 A
further shipment of J2.5CO.000 is on the way
to San Francisco from Sydney. This makes it
evident that the London market will find a
way to meet Its gold obligations to New York
without etress and possibly ' without - actual
shipments of gold. It is to be noted, however,
that United States treasury operations con
tinued to drain the money market, the Gov
ernn-'nfs surplus thus far this month having
reached $1,554,021. while" for the corresponding
period of last year the Government's fiscal
operations showed a deficit of $4,3S1,563. The
market closed rather heavy under the Influence
Of profit-taking on the day's rise.
Railroad bonds continued very dull and with

Quotations for Raisins are dropped, as the

the remarkable demand for dried fruits this
year. Prunes are also being rapidly worked

time the new crop is on the market.
Other fruits are stiff, with a continued de
irand, and another advance in Apples Is .noted.
This fruit Is scarce all over the world this

than usual in consequence. Nuts are steady.

Weather Report.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Frequent rain,
with thunderstorms and occasional hall, oc
curred in the mountain sections. Considerable
datr.ere in Redlands district to orchards, .fruits
and flume?. Harvesting peaches, plums and
pears; crop generally light, quality- good.
ET'REKA SUMMARY.â Heavy fogs were
beneScial to all crops near coast; but high
temperatures continue ia the interior. Fruit
is ripeninjj rapidly. Rain is ' much needed.
Oat thrashing in progress; an average crop
is practically assured. Â¦ .
Warra weather has continued during the
week, with cool, foggy nights and mornings.
Grapes are ripening rapidly and will yield a
fclr crc.p. Thei-o is a good crop of late peaches.
Melons are plentiful and of excellent quality.
Walnuts are locking well and are said to be
past danger; the yield wijl be about the same
bs last year. Citrus fruits are in good con
dition. Large shipments of lemons are being
xn&de from San Diego. There is a large yield
of honey, superior in quality. Barley is poor
in quality, but a fair yield. Sugar beets and
vegetables are doing well.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Very warm end sultry weather prevailed dur
ing the week, the first portion being clear and
the latter generally cloudy. Light sprinkles
cf rain fell Thursday night and Friday morn
ing over a greater portion of the valley, but
the precipitation was too light to cause any
damas". The grain harvert is about com
pleted in all sections and the yield and quality
have been good. Deciduous fruits are ripening
very fast and the canneries and dryers are in
full operation. Large chipments of green fruit
continue to Eastern markets and of melons to
the Northwest. The melon crop 1* large and
of excellent quality. Sweet potatoes are mak
ing excellent progress, with Indications of a
lanre crcl>. Grapes are doing nicely; the earlier
varieties are being marketed and some shipped
to Eastern markets. Water continues plentiful
nnd stock of all kinds are Jn good condition.
Farmers are busy preparing for fall work.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY
Warra days, cool nights and foggy mornings
have continued during the week and conditions
bave been favorable for all crops. Harvesting,
thrashing and hay baling are progressing. In
some cf the northern counties wheat and bar
ley are reported light crops, but in the central
nnd southern counties the yield is better and
nearly average in Bcme places. Hops have
made rapid growth and are in excellent con
cition: picking will begin seen. Beets, corn
end potatoes are doing well. Fruit trees are
in pood condition. Gripes continue thrifty and
in some sections good crops will be gathered.
Th*> fieciducus: fruit crop in the Santa Ciara
Valley is much below average, but moEt of
the fruit is of good quality. Late fruits are
ripening rapidly. Prunes are turning out bet
ter than expected In Sonoma County.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS
High temperatures have continued during the
week a~d conditions have been favorable for
farm work. Fruit picking and curing have
progressed rapidly and large shipments of
fresh fruit have been made to Eastern markets.
Grapes have been considerably injured by heat
in some Eections, while in others little damage
has been done, owing to heavy foliage on the
vines. In many places the grape crop will be
tight, as a result of too close pruning and late
Fpring: frosts. Hop picking is progressing and
an average crop of excellent quality is being
Fathered. Grain -harvest is nearly completed;
m-heat and barley have yielded excellent crops.
Sugar beet harvest continues. Corn and veg
etables are doing well. Almond picking has
commenced.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.
Grain harvest continues in many sections
and thrashing is in progress. There are large
quantities of unthrashed wheat and barley and
unbaled hay in sections where thrashers and
balers are yet unobtainable, and there is Â«ome
danger that these crops may be seriously in
jured by early rain?. Nearly all sections ex
cept Southern California and portions of the
northern coast counties report heavy crops of
â¢wheat, barley and hay, all of superior quality.
Hop picking is progressing in many places;
the yield is about average and the quality
excellent. Sugar beet harvest continues in the
Sacramento Valley. Beans, corn and vege
tables are in good condition. There are no
further reports of injury to grapes by heat
and it is believed the damage done was not
terious. The late spring frosts, however,
caused considerable damage, and in many
places the yield will be below average: the
quahty of the grapes is reported excellent.
Late fruits are ripening rapidly and large
Fhipments are being made to Eastern markets.
Prunes are yielding much better crops than
â¢was expected in some sections. Melons are
abundant and of g-ood quality. Citrus fruits
and walnuts are doing well. Almond picking
t&s commenced in Solano County. - ' -
High temperatures have continued in the in
terior, with warm days and cool, foggy nights
elong the coast. Light sprinkles of rain have
fallen In some sections, and thunderstorms
with hÂ»a.vy rain and hall have occurred in the
mountain districts.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits
CHICAGO, Aug. 20.â September wheat opened
a shade to %@%c higher, at 70%@71%c, on a
small amount of buying occasioned by steady
cables from Liverpool and reiteration of re
ports claiming serious damage in Russia. These
influences lasted only a few minutes and there
after the tone of the- market was weak. Heavy
receipts r.nd a failing off In seaboard clearances
were influential. A feature was selling for the
Northwest account against purchases of new
spring wheat. The market, during the fore
noon, dropped to 69%c. where it steadied on the
cessation of selling, but the close was weak,
1%@1%c lower, at 70c.
Corn had a firm opening, but soon fell into
line with wheat. Reports of recent rains were
a bear, factor. September closed ?Â»c lower than
yesterday, at 57%c. '
Oats were sold liberally in sympathy with
corn. September closed %c lower, at 33%c.
" Holders of provisions, . influenced by the
downward course of grain prices, loosened their
grip" freely during the session and the result
was a low level of values. The market at no
time showed any strength. January pork closed
25c lower, lard 12%@15c lower and ribs 15c de
pressed.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
"Raisins, which advanced yesterday, are
quiet to-day at the advance. There is some
Inquiry, but no transactions of importance are
reported. All stocks are firmly held and con
cessions are refused. In other lines previous
conditions prevailed."
"Currents are held very firm, but no increase
Â¦was reported yesterday. Sales are small,
though there is mors inquiry apparently and
the feeling in the trade is quite satisfactory.
Cables report the sitvation en the other side
cs substantially unchanged. The outlooTt fa
vors a good crop of good quality fruit.
"The prune situation is unchanged. Condi
tions do not cause a very large movement in
any 6ize, but some business In 40-60s is noted
at about previous figures. It Is eaid that
prices on futures are likely to open at 3%c,
but it Is unknown whether that statement is
true or not. The impression seems to be gain-
Ing adherents in the trade, but so far as
known no one has any authority to make the
statement.
Hall advices from New Ycrk say: "All va
rieties of dried fruits are practically un
changed from previous reports. There is a
<juiet buying interest in almost all varieties of
epot goods, but interest in rutures is ap
parently increasing. Conditions are not par

The Vicunas have been prominent In

have been an.. interesting acquisition to

WASHINGTON, Aug. 2O.-.The State De
partment is 'advised by telegraph of the
death of Senor Don Carlos Mora Vicuna,
Minister fioir. Chile to the United States,
which occurred at Buffalo^ this morning.
The notification came from" the Senor
Infanta, First Secretary of the Chilean
legation, who has been with the Minister
at Buffalo, and gave no details beyond
the simple announcement that Senor Vi
cuna had passed away. He had been ill
for some time with pneumonia and after
throwing off the first attack suffered a re
lapse from which he was unable to rally.
Owing to his being. the diplomatic rep
resentative of Chile to the United States
the Government will show every consid
eration, of respect and honor to the de
ceased. Besides being Minister from Chile
he was commissioner to the Pan-Ameri
can Exposition â¢ and lately a delegate on
the Chilean Claims Commission.
Kennedy evidently appreciated what he
had done and is now hiding from the po
lice. Inquiry at his place of business yes
terday - developed the fact- that; he had
gone over to Oakland "on business."; The
Kennedys have been married more than
seven years and have no children. This
is not the first time the husband has mis
treated his Â¦ wife and it is understood that
she will file suit for a'- divorce as soon as
she can leave her bed. ..
Mrs. Kennedy haa, been. confined to her
bed for. the -last four days and will be
taken to-day to the French Hospital. Her
condition is precarious and no one Is per
mitted to see her. â¢ â¢.'-.. â¢Â¦
The poor woman managed . to get on
her feet, rushed out of the house and
found a welcome in her brother's home.
She was suffering from the scalding she
received and it was necessary to call in
Dr. Sprague to attend her. Her arm and
breast were blistered from the hot water
and her side was black and blue where
her brutal husband had kicked her. The
poor woman also suffered a severe shock
to her nervous system. Had her, brother
known how badly his sister had been
treated he would have d,ealt without mer
cy with the husband.. He only learned
after the husband had come to the house
for his-wife that; she bau received , the
cruel treatment. â¢ â¢
John F. Kennedy, foreman* of a black
smithing establishment at 628 Howard
street, has inflicted injuries on his wife
that may cause her death. On Friday
evening last he returned to his home at
515 Jones street in an intoxicated . condi
tion and struck Mrs. Kennedy and kicked
her and then poured a kettle of boiling
water over the unfortunate woman. A
warrant will be sworn out for his arrest
en", a charge of battery, but the charge
will be made more serious if his wife suc
cumbs # to his brutal treatment.
Kennedy is a powerfully built man and
when in liquor he is very ugly. He re
turned home from, work last Friday night
long after the dinner hour, and when his
wife remonstrated with him he turned
on her and beat her. He felled her to the
floor with a heavy blow >and while, the
helpless woman was lying there he kicked
her. Her cries for help seemed to arouse
him to greater frenzy and he grabbed up
a kettle of boiling water and , poured it
over her.

the facts to be as stated in resolutions
adopted by the board, ".none of the
conditions and icquirements Imposed upon

NATIONAL LEAGUE.
Montanari largely redeemed herself last
night, singing Marguerite quite sweetly.
The role is well within her range and she
did really good work therein. Agostini
sang Kaust, and exceedingly well. He
was very enthusiastically 'welcomed by
the audience, and indeed all the artists,
including Mr. Steindorff, received a hearty
reception.
Dado appeared in the title role, his first
adequate opportunity of the season, and
more than confirmed the favorable im
pression he made with his preceding ef
forts. He sings admirably, looks only
less the Mephisto than De Heszke and
acts v.-ith power but without a hint of
the cynic humor of the part. But he is
so satisfactory vocally, and the humor
happens luckily to be less essential to
Boito's Mephisto than to the Gounod Sa
tan, so that on. the whole it is a most
pleasing performance.
It is late in the day to compare thÂ»
Gounod "Faust" and the "Mefistofele,"
that came some ten years later, by the
way, but it is a most interesting compari
son to make. One hardly goes away
whistling the Boito any more than one
whistles the "Symphonie Fantastique" or
Wagner even, the former of which it
somewhat strongly resembles in places.
It has an imaginative quality of highest
order, not always adequately expressed,
but throughout the music is of noble
reach and sometimes of most melodious
expression.
Trader Steindorff and the Principals
Score a Success in the Big
Production.
The Tivoli has outdone itself this week
in the production of Boito's "Mefistofele,"
given last night to another of the large
houses that are the order of the season.
Perhaps more than to any one else credit
is due to Mr. Steindorff for the good work
done. The choruses went with admirable
sureness and spirit, the ensemble being
notably good in the difficult concerted
work in the first act. and the orchestra
might have been as lavishly familiar with
the opera as with "II Trovatore," for ex
ample, from tlie ease and certainty of its
efforts. Again, much credit is due the
stage manager, costumes and. settings be
ing of unusual splendor and fitness, and
the principals were all very satisfactory.
Altogether "Mefistofele" is the big thing
of the season so far, and will be certainly
so far appreciated.

The story opens at the sea Â¦ beach at
Santa Cruz last Tuesday afternoon with
a waffle man well in the foreground.
Young-, Wyman was introduced on the
beach to Miss Sweet by the vender of
waffles, a mutual friend. The acquaint
anceship was very rapidly followed by
numerous meetings along the ro
mantic shores of the bay. Papa
Sweet was at work at Watsonvllle.
Young Mr. Collins, who had some
time previously wooed and won the
girl's hand, was also away at his post at
Mare Island. So young Wyman. all ig
norant of the true situation, had an op
portunity to make love. His advances
were apparently encouraged. By Satur
day Miss Sweet had completely forgotten
her soldier sweetheart. His memory was
so absolutely obliterated that when her
new admirer proposed marriage he was
accepted on the spot.
Policemen, bicycles, callow ' lovers,
angry father and a pursuing sweetheart
are badly tangled in the skein of matri
monial adventure that culminated in the
wedding- ceremony at the City Jail.
And the only explanation that little Miss
Sweet can offer for her astonishing
escapade is that she "must have been
hypnotized." But the forlorn Wyman,
who at the last momen: was euchered out
of a bride, looks at. the situation from a
more practical point of view. He says the
angry papa was the responsible party.

The first message sent after the vessel
had reported herself was to Lenox, Mass.
Another was sent to Philadelphia. These
messages were sent over land wires to
the office of the Herald and soon found
their way to those for whom they were
intended. Passengers expressed astonish
ment at the manner in which the signal
ing was conducted. The Kaiser "Wilhelm
der Grosse was in communication with
the lightship for more than forty miles.
The instruments worked perfectly and
there was no short circuiting. Passengers
took turns at looking into the windows of
the deckhouse, where sparks were leap
ing across between the brazen knobs. The
display of electricity was interesting
aside from what it signified. The opera
tor worked with great quickness and dex
terity. ,:; .
Captain Hogemann repdrted that the
vessel was out twenty miles from Nan
tucket lightship when the operator an
nounced that he was in communication
with the lightship. The pulsations were
at first very faint.. The operator mads
out, however, the words, "Have you any
news for the Herald?" The vibration of
the vessel at times interfered with send
ing and receiving of messages, but the
system worked well. As the steamer ap
proached nearer the lightship the mes
sages were remarkably distinct. Atone
time the vessel was within a mile of. the
lightship. - ,â.
Marconi instruments were placed in ons
of the amair houses aft on the boat deck.
The wire was led to the top of towering
masts a few yards away. It was care
fully examined as the vessel neared Nan
tucket, for Captain Hogemann had a
vivid recollection of a test which was un
successful because it was discovered too
late that wireless messages were being
flashed through a steam winch instead of
into tha air.
Although it was raining at Jwenty min
utes past 10 o'clock on Monday night
when the vessel first got into communi

Special Dispatch to The Call.
To-night Secret Service agents saw "Wei
gel and he gave them what he had re
maining of the notes except those he kept
for his collection. He was not arrested.
Ludwig. the junk man. turned over the
plates. These were still in the package
in which they were wrapped after being
last used. The seals were unbroken.
They bore the seal of the bank and also
that of the receiver and there could be no
question that they had never been used
since the bank last ran off a lot of the
bills.
Among others he sold some to Green
berg & Smith of San Francisco. This
firm, Weigel says, afterward sent him
large orders for the notes, and in all pur
chased some $175,000 worth, counting their
face value. The plates remained in tftc
possession of the junk dealer.
NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â Government Se
cret Service officers to-night visited
New Brunswick. N. J., and obtained pos
session of the plates and nearly $200.
000 (face value) of the notes of
the Old State Bank of New Bruns
wick. The notes were not reprinted from
the old plates. They were genuinely print
ed thirty years or more ago by the bank
Itself, but were never signed by the presi
dent and cashier. Lax method in wind
ing up the affairs of the bank twenty-six
years ago seem to have been responsible
for the alleged big swindle in other States
with the bank notes as a basis.
The bank went into liquidation some
years ago. Colonel John A. Newell was
at that time appointed receiver and wound
up the affairs of the institution. He has
since died. In the course of his operations
he sold the old note plate to Adam Lud
wig, a junk dealer of New Brunswick.
The sale was as old metal. The junk
dealer also bought the waste paper and all
the junk out of the bank. In the waste
paper he found about half a million dol
lars worth of notes. These were in the
original sheets, uncut and unsigned.
These notes he sold or gave to Jacob
Weigel. who is a collector of coins and old
notes and who has a very large collection,
one of the most extensive in the country.
He kept them some years and then be
gan to dispose of them to coin dealers. He
sold many of them to reputable dealers
in all parts of the country. He received
nominal sums for his sales.
Acting Chief Secret Service Agent Mof
fitt saya that the city has been flooded
with these notes of the denominations of
Â»1 and $2. which Smith has sold at prices
ranging from fifteen to twenty-five cents
on the par value of one dollar, to the dis
tributors who have been passing them off
at par. .
Hagan was unable to procure bail yes
terday end remains In jail. He signed his
own name to the notes, it is charged, as
president of the defunct bank, and this
fact has saved him from a prosecution for
forgery.
Edward W. Smith, stenographer for
Major Blakeney of the United States Life
Saving Service, was released on $2000 bail
yesterday. The bail of William Hagan,
his alleged accomplice, was fixed at $2000.
Smith's defense will be that the notes
are not counterfeits, but printed from
genuine plates of the State Bank of New
Brunswick, which went out of existence
about thirty years ago, and that the
bank's notes are regularly quoted in the
catalogues of numismatists and curio col
lectors.

COLON, Colombia. Aug. 20.â The Chi
nese assert that among the raiders of
Emperador station last Saturday night
were several necrroes from Jamaica, who.
after flogging Chinese traders, demanded
and obtained $200. Exchange at Barran
<;u'"la is rising by leaps and bounds. An
American dollar is now equivalent to $41
in Colombian paper money.
"Gcr.eral Gonzales Valencia- has re
turned to invade us by the way of San
FestSna. probably, although he has con
cealed his movement as much as possible.
Thinking- that possibly his advance might
be on Colon (Tachira), I gave orders to
General Ruben Cardenas in order that
with his battalions hÂ° might meet the en
emy at La Cumbre, . where I judge the
enemy would have made their advance."
This proclamation was issued after the
battle of San Cristobal and is dated Au
gust 8. Of the same date and at the same
place (San Cristobal), another proclama
tion Issued by General Celistino Castro
reads in part:
Copies of Castro's official organ, pub
lished at Caracas, which were brought
here on the Maracaibo to-day, contain a
proclamation from the President, in which
he calls on "the Venezuelan patriots to
rejoice as our flag- streams In triumph
over the Colombian frontier â the enemy
has fledâ victory Is ours. On the field of
battle fell 800 bodies of the rebels, their
artillery abandoned, many taken prison
ers and their banners torn."
My source of Information as to the reported
Colombian invasion is the Etatement made by
General Castro as above. The impression I re
ceived from my interview with President Cas
tro was that he mas fully determined to con
tinue administering the affairs of Venezuela
along the aggressive lines indicated by his re
cent actions.
I am not awar* that Dr. Rico, the Colombian
Minister, in leaving the legation in the hands
of the American Charge d' Affaires, had either
demanded or received his passports. I know,
however, that he felt it was impossible for him
to remain longer, and he went with the purpose
of communicating with his Government. Gen
eral Pulido. the ex-Mlnlster of War, who was
replaced by General Guerra in the early part
oC August, left the Cabinet because he could
not approve of war with Colombia.
Caracas is quiet. Everything is proceeding as
DssaL The guarantees of the constitution
have, however, been susj>encsed on account of
the invasion of the Venezuelan soil, according
f> information received by President Castro to
that effect. War bulletins are issued at fre
quent intervals. General Castro, in an inter
view on August IP. told me that he had a force
of 10.000 men at San Cristobal, commanded by
his brother, Celistino Castro, and that he had
V'.COO other troops in the three border States.
He paid that no option was left to him in that
matter; that he must protect Venezuela. .Mar
tial law exists in these three States: Merida,
Trunjillo and Tachira.

"Well, I suppose that the Consular of

think that they must be on the safe side,
and so they report to Washington and
the ship's are sent as a matter of course."
Colonel J. R. Shaler, general superin
tendent of the Panama Railroad, who was
a passenger on the Orizaba, ridiculed the
reports of battles and incursions at the
isthmus, and said there was no revolution
Jn Colombia. Neither had there been any
interference with his road. He continued:
"The fan.* that 1 have left for a trip to
New \orU is evidence that there is no
disorder or trouble whatever at the isth
rrus. I read of a battle which I know
:.ever took place. There were many bat
talions engaged and 900 dead, but there
was never any such forces and they never
saw each other, and nobody was
scratched. People who do not understand
conditions down there take these stories
seriously, but those who are on the
pround do not."
"We neither saw nor heard anything of
any trouble while in the harbor." said
Captain Smith. "I did not go ashore my
eelt but I know that everything was
! eaceful and quiet. The Government had
put a few soldiers on the trains running
across the isthmus, but that is often
done."

LETTER STIRS
KNOX'S WRATH
Attorney General Dis
pleased by a Com
munication.
He Declares He Knows Noth
ing About the Big Steel
Trust.
"WASHINGTON. Aug. 20.â Attorney
General Hnox to-day sent tha following
letter to the Joint committee of the Ameri
can Anti-Trust League and District As
sembly 66, Knights of Labor. In reply, to
one from the committee requesting infor
mation from Knox regarding the United
States Steel Corporation:
WASHINGTON. D. C. August 20.
H. B. Martin, chairman joint committee. .
American Anti-Trust Leagueâ Sir: 1 have the
honor to acknowledge the receipt of your let
ter of August 19, 1901, in which you request
to obtain information with reference to cer
tain alleged "agreement or agreements between
the constituent companies and individuals who
organized the United States Steel Corporation."
You ask me to afford you all the Information
that "I may possess or can obtain," and you
specifically refer to an alleged "trust or syn
dicate agreement" which you state the presi
dent of the United States Steel Corporation,
C. M. Schwab, "refused to furnish the United
States Industrial Commission when on, the wit
ness stand before that body, and you further
state that your request for information^ Is to
be understood as covering any "other contracts
or a similar kind with which you arÂ© ac
quainted or which you can obtain for us."
You also state that your request for infor
mation is "founded upon Information and be
lief that at the time this contract, or con
tracts was or were made," I was "in
some way officially " connected with the Car
negie Company," and you, therefore, assume
that the information which you request must
be in "my "possession or conveniently at hand."
I am, therefore, requested to give you sub
stantial facts, or, if possible, a copy thereof.
Primarily, permit me to> say that your re
quest is founded upon an erroneous assumption.
I do not know who the Individuals are who
organized the United States Steel Corporation.
If they are the referred to usually In
the newspapers as the promoters of that or
ganization, with the single exception of C. M.
Schwab, I do not know, never saw, and never
was in any way connected with any of them.
I never heard of any agreement between them,
and the constituent members of the steel.cor
poration. â¢ â¢
Neither at the time of. the formation of the
United States Steel Corporation, nor at any
time, was I officially connected with the Car
negie Steel Company. I was formerly one of
its legal advisers In the conduct of its manu
facturing business, but was never consulted
with reference to the formation of the United
States Steel Company, nor In relation of the
sale to that company of the shares of stock
held by the stockholders of the Carnegie Com
pany. I have never seen the papers of agree
ment to which you refer, nor have I been
informed of their contents. I have no knowl
edge whatever of their existence, their terms
or scope. I am thus specific, as I desire to
cover both the spirit and the letter of your
inquiry.
I may say, however, that I have no access to
the agreements or papers to which you refer.
I know nothlnsr of the one to which you es
pecially refer, and do not even know that such
an agreement Is in existence. The information
you request is not in my possession or "con
veniently at hand," as you assume, and it is
therefore impossible for me to comply with
any one of the requests set forth In your let
ter. All this information you could at any
time have acquired through tha usual metlrecT
of direct personal inquiry, thereby avoiding
the doubtful propriety of addressing mÂ«
through the medium of an open letter which
you concurrently delivered to this office.
Whether, if such papers were accessible to me.
it would be my duty to obtain them and fur
nish them for use in legal proceedlntcs to
which you are a party, and the nature of
which you do not explain. Is a question which.
I do not care at this time to discuss.
Â¦If I may regard the letter as addressed to
me officially. I will say: If this department
is under obligations to furnish information to
prospective litlcants In undisclosed proceed
ings, its responsibilities and labors are neces
sarily greater than they have ever been im
agined from the â¢ time of its formation. In
deed. Â«s there are eenerally two parties â¢ to
every controversy, it would be difficult to dis
charge such alleged duty to both parties In
view of conflicting Interests. This department
was not called into being to furnish informa
tion to private litigants. Its duty and its ob
ject is to enforce the Federal statutes as in
terpreted by the courts wherever there la
probable cause for believing: that they hava
been violated. "Very respectfully, i
P. C. KXOX. Attorney General.
Supported Grant and Got Shot.
Because John Canning shot Herman
Abel in the neck with a revolver as an
expression of disagreement of Abel's
statement that General Grant could free
the Cubans in a month If he commanded
the forces they, put in the field against
the Spanish, Judge Kerrigan has given
judgment against Canning and in favor of
Abel for $3000. The discussion that re
sulted in the shooting occurred in April
of 1S97. Abel expressed his confidence in
General Grant's ability and Canning, dis
agreeing, shot him. Canning was fined
$50 for simple issault and then Abel filed
suit for damages -with the result stated.

A small safe In the office of H. J. Owen,
coal dealer, 205 Jones street, was blown
open â¢ shortly after 1 o'clock . yesterday
morning and $8 In silver, which was all
the money it contained, was stolen. The
explosion was heard by several people liv
ing in the neighborhood. Entrance had
been effected by forcing open the front
door with the aid of a "Jimmy." The knob
of the safe had been knocked off and pow
der inserted in the hole. The .rest was
easy. The only thing left for a clew. was
a piece of fuse. Captain Seymour was
notified and he detailed Detective Byram
on the case.

Prices for the French crop are quoted
as follows: 50-55, 8% cents per pound; 55
65, 7 cents per pound; 70-75, 6 cents per
pound ; 80-85, 5% cents per pound, future
delivery September. The harvest of last
year was very good, both in quantity and
quality. The amount of it is still in doubt.
The minimum estimate is 800,000 quintals,
â¢but there are many who contend that the
total was 1,000,000 quintals. ~ In addition to
this 500,000 quintals were imported from
the United States. How much of the old
crop, native or imported, is still on hand
is not known. Sales of the old crop 'were
reported on July 27 as follows: 45-50, $6 85
per 110 pounds; 55-60, $5 60; 65-70, $5 21; 75
10, 54 82%; 85-90. $4 63; 95-100, $3 96; 115-120.
$3 09. - .
Comparing these figures with prices at
the advanced sales for the new crop may
give the California growers a chance to
estimate concerning the general opinion
of prune values at . Bordeaux this year.
Mr. Tourgee sent a competent observer
to view the crop of the present year and
he learned much. The estimate of the
total product is 580,000 to 610,000 quintals.
The newspaper reports in France put it
at 40O.Q0O to 500,000 quintals. The fruit is
of unusually large size and the reports
are to* the effect that there will be very
few of the smaller grades. All fruits In
France are of large size this year and
many trees are without any smaller sized
fruit. .
United States Consul Albion "W. Tourgee
has sent a report to the Commercial
Museum from Bordeaux, which was re
ceived yesterday, relative to the prune
crop of France, which contains much In
formation tbat is of value to th* Cali
fornia prune producers. One leading- point
is the outlook for the present crop. Tour
gee wrote that If the weather kept dry
as it had been for some days, the crop*
would be 25 per cent less than last year,
but of unusual size and fine appearance.
If the weather turns wet and foggy again
the crop will be small, perhaps not more
than one-half of the crop of last year, the
fruit being large but of doubtful quality.
Fruit -Is of Fine Quality but
One-Fourth Sh,ort in
Quantity.

' Black hails from Hamburg, Arkansas.
He claims to have served an enlistment
with the Twentieth Infantry and to have
been in the Philippines as a civilian scout
with the Thirty-fourth Regiment of
volunteers. He has made four trips to
Manila, he says, returning the last time
on the Aztec. Until a few days ago he
worked in Rio Vista and came here 'to
take advaptage of the high wages offered
for non-union teamsters. *
Black, who appears to be simple minded,
declares that he and Fulmer were the
best of friends and if he shot him he has
no recollection thereof. "The gun was
lying on the Jiay," he said. "I picked it
up and either placed it on the ground or
leaned it against the wall. While I was
getting some hay for ray horses the gun
went off and Fulmer said he had been
shot." Â¦
Black was arrested later in the evening
by Police Detective Ryan and Railroad
Detective Lewin and taken to the Central
Prison, where a charge of assault with
intent to commit murder was booked
against him.
According to Fulmer's story he had Just
finished currying his horse and was hang
ing up his curry comb when he turned
around and saw Black, or "Fat" as he
was known at the barn, with the shotgun
in his hands. "Don't point that gun this
way," he said, to he declares. With that
Black, whom Fulmer describes as quick
tempered and a. little crazy at times, de
liberately, pointed the gun toward him and
fired.
William Fulmer, a non-union teamster
in the employ of. Cutter '& Co., 102 Clay
street, was last night shot and seriously
wounded at the* company's barn on Perry
court, between Fifth and Sixth streets,
by Elmer Black, a teamster in the same
employ. A 52-calibcr shotgun was the
weapon employed. The men were only
about ten feet apart. Fulmer was taken
to the Central Emergency. Hospital, where
it was found that his left shoulder was
virtually blown away. He may recover.

Employe.
USES SHOTGUN OH" FRIEND,
Galvin lived with his mother and broth
er at 711 Webster street. He was to have
been married In the fall to Miss Sarah
Meaney of 1218 Jones street. Miss Meaney
is employed in the Crocker book bind
ery, where Galvin worked until a few
weeks ago as bookkeeper. Deceased was
24 years of age.
Both men are ex-soldiers. Galvin .was
a - member of the First California and
Duncan of the First Washington Regi
ment. They were close friends in Manila
and renewed the intimacy after their reg
iments were mustered out. They entered
Curtin's service last Friday and at their
particular request were detailed to work
together. Duncan was locked up last
night, but will probably be released to
day. He is broken-hearted over the oc
currence.
Galvin, earlier in the day, had purchased
a cheap revolver. Something went wrong
with the mechanism and when he and
Duncan went to work about 6 o'clock
they took the revolver to pieces for the
purpose of locating the break. Duncan
left his friend putting the weapon to
gether and went into an adjoining room,
where there was no light. Galvin fol
lowed a few seconds later. "I can't get
this thing to work. You see what you
can do with it," hesaid, as he handed the
pistol to Duncan. Duncan reached for
it in the dark, but before he had secured
it Galvin loosened "his hold and the wea
pon fell to the ground. It exploded. The
bullet struck Galvin in the stomach.
Duncan rushed to the sidewalk, where
he tried in vain to attract the attention
of the police by blowing his whistle. He
then telephoned for the Emergency Hos
pital ambulance, but secured an express
wagon before. its arrival ajid hurried his
friend to the Central Hospital. .
Chief Surgeon Bunnell did what he
could, for the injured man, but there was
no hope from the first, and Calvin died
soon after leaving the table. Before dy
ing, however, he made a statement com
pletely exonerating Duncan. The stories
of the accident as told by Galvin before
he died and by Duncan when seen later
at the Central Prison tally in every par
ticular.
Thomas Galvin, of 711 Webster street, a
special officer In the employ of the Curtin
Detective Agency, was accidentally shot
and killed last night by G. ' M. Duncan,
his chum and fellow officer. The men
were detailed to watch the barn of the
Philadelphia Vinegar Works at Seventh
and Bryant streets, where the shooting
Occurred. . "''

"There Is a taint of insanity on the
mother's side," said' "Hill yesterday.

The fact that the citizens footed the ca
tering bills when the illustrious, guests
were under the Scott roof is not specific
ally mentioned-in the report. On the last
page is an item of "hotel accommodations,
$7434 65." Members of the reception com
mittee who do not care to have their
names published say that the 2000 is in
cluded in this sum. "Mr." Scott's home
was not a hotel, certainly," so one of. the
members remarked, "but the illness of
Mrs. McKinley made a long ' residence
there a necessity. We were : perfectly
willing to pay for the catering.- It is not
true that' Henry T. Scott received any pay
for lodgings, gas or heating. 'Â¦' He made no
charge for the use of his residence. It is
true that the funds provided by subscrip
tions defrayed the major share of the ex
pense -incurred,' the . outlay being Â¦ for the
caterer." Â¦ - ; Â¦> â¢â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦ : Â¦ .
. It is now made plain that the citizens
of San Francisco paid the lion's share of
the expense of entertaining President and
Mrs. McKinley In the residence of Henry
T. Scott. This statement 1 is due because
the general public has entertained the idea
that to Scott belonged all; the credit.
Something like $2000 came from the funds
supplied by business houses and individ
uals for the good cheer dispensed in the
Scott home, then known as the Executive
Mansion, and was paid to a caterer, whose
bill, with' a slight deduction of $500, has
since been approved by the finance com
mittee of the citizens' reception commit
tee. The finance- committee has just is
sued a report, signed by F. W. Dohrmann
as chairman and H. U. Brandensteln, as
secretary, in which the disbursements for,
the President's reception are stated, under
various- headings, to have amounted to
530,187 40. Â¦, ->â¢': ./. â¢Â¦ . - . . Â¦
Captain Metcalf is' known- in shipping

came here in 1S75 as -master of the White

Metcalf ran' her between here and Hong

sea and settled down ashore as Lloyds'
surveyor. .For. the last eleven years; he
has been in business here and has earned
a, title as an expert that no man can
challenge. No man stands higher in the

?. Captain John Metcalf, Lloyd surveyor
and one of the best known men in busi
ness'circles on 'California street, is to be
married to-night in the Palace Hotel. The
news will come as a surprise to his host
of' friends, as the matter has been kept
very secret and' few outside the families
most- interested knew anything about the
contemplated event.
Finally he drifted to San Francisco and
secured employment as a solicitor for The
Call and later for the Bulletin. Finally
Hill, who was well acquainted with his
family, took him into his office as out
side man, and he remained with him until
about four months ago, when he went to
work for the Western Loan Company.
At Hill's office it was said that as soon
as Pearson got into his new place â¢ he
wrote letters to Hill's customers in ' an
endeavor to get them away from him; No
Pearson was a man about 31 years of
age and a native ot Spartansburg, S. C,
where his parents still reside. At one
time he was a clerk to Master -in Chan
cery L. R. Hill, at present a financial
broker in the Merchants' Exchange build
ing. After Hill left his office and came to
this coast Pearson Joined the army and
served the full term of his enlistmentâ
three years. On his discharge he went to
Los Angeles, where he earned a precar
ious livelihood as a solicitor. Â¦ -
In the directory Pearson's name appears
as the manager of ' the Western Loan
Company, S09 Phelan building. He went
to that concern some four months ago
and for a time his name appeared upon
the door as manager, but was soon taken
off. It was stated yesterday at the office
of the company that no authority had
ever been given Pearson to assume that
title. â¢ â¢
"During the last few weeks of his stay
here he met a Mr. and Mrs. Harris of .206
West Seventy-second street, Chicago,
where Harris has been employed for some
ten years as a bookkeeper In a conserva
tory of music. Through them he became
Imbued with the idea of going to Chicago,
and left about ten days before them,
agreeing to meet them there. He pro
cured a scalper's ticket and left a few
days earlier than he originally intended."
"Pearson came . to room with me last
November," she said, "and was one of
the quietest roomers I have had during
my twenty-five years' experience in the
business. He .seemed always morose' and
silent and spoke but little about himself.
Of an evening he would come in and talk
to me. but his conversation had a most
depressing effect, and I generally would
find some excuse for cutting the visit
short. He rarely talked about himself or
about business, save, to tell me. he was
connected with a money lending concern
in the Phelan "building. â¢.' â¢_
B. F. Pearson is the I name of the sui

Company, led to the establishment of his
identity. The record showed that it was

HOTEL MYSTERY
HE 6 reat event at yesterday's ses-
I sion of the Grand Council of the
I Young Men's Institute, which did
\\ not adjourn until 6 o'clock in the
afternoon, was the defeat by an
overwhelming majority of the proposition
introduced by Ignatian Council No. 35 to
change the name of the organization from
the Young Men's Institute to the Catholic
Institute of America. Â¦ â¢
The council was opened in due form in
the morning. Grand President L. E. Ma
han in the chair.
Greetings were read from the grand of
ficers of the Young Ladies' Institute and
from the Catholic Ladies' Aid Society.
Responses were also received from the
prominent members of the clergy to whom
congratulatory dispatches were sent the
day before.
A resolution was adopted to the effect
that hereafter there shall be voted from
the fund of the Grand Council the sum of
$200 to the council or councils in whose
city the grand body shall meet to help de
fray the cost of entertaining the grand of
ficers and delegates.
It was stated before the adoption of this
resolution that the only, city that would
ask for the next" session of the Grand
Council would be Napa, but the offer of
the sum named will probably induce the
delegates from other localities to ask for
the honor of entertaining the grand body.
During the session there was an elo
quent address by J. M. Burnett of Igna
tian Council.
The afternoon session was called at 1:30
and the special order, the proposed change
of name, was taken up. It provoked a dis
cussion that lasted until 6 o'clock and in
which many took part. The most promi
nent" speakers were I. B. Queen, Past
Grand Presidents John J. McDade, John
Lynch and M. W. Fleming; Supreme
President F. J. Kierce, the Rev. Father
McQuaid, Joseph Kenny, Neal Power, P.
H. Ryan and P. J. Murphy. The argu
ment in favor of the proposition was that
the objects of the organization were not
sufficiently stated in the present name,
while that In favor of the retention was
that wherever the Young Men's Institute
The Jealousies among the heads of the
different departments of the Southern Pa
cific Company, the resultant clashes in
which Hays lost his prestige and was
shorn of his power, his dissatisfaction
thereat and his subsequent resignation
have all been published exclusively In the
columns of this paper from time to time.
On Sunday last The Call named the man
who will succeed Hays in the management
of the great Syndicated Harriman proper
ties. Samuel Morse Felton of the Chi
cago and Alton Company. To-day this
paper names the road to which Mr. Hays
will go upon leaving this coast. The whole
story has been told, and now all that re
mains Is for the subordinate officers
in the yellow building on Market and
Montgomery streets to cry "The King is
dead." and get ready to shout "Long live
the King."
The Grand Trunk Railway Company, to
which Mr. Hays will return, was formed
August 12, 1S82, by consolidation with the
Great Western. The company thus form
ed was united with the Northern Railway
Company of Canada and its leased line,
the Hamilton and Northwestern. On
January 24, 18S8, the consolidation took
the present came of the Grand Trunk
Railway, Canada. In 1892 a number of
email lines, whose aggregate length Is
1158 miles, were taken into the system.
The total length of all the lines that will
come under the direction of Mr. Hays in
his Eastern position is about 3600 miles.
As these figures include everything. It will
be seen that while the position he is go
ing back to is of some importance, it is
but small when taken in comparison with
the place he has been forced to relin
quish.
The Grand Trunk Railway.
The next seven years, or until April 1,
I8S4. he was secretary to the general man
ager of the Missouri Pacific Railway.
From April 1, 1SS4. to October 1, 1SS6, he
was secretary to the general manager of
the "VVabash. St. Louis and Pacific Rail
way. On October 1. 18S6. he was made
assistant general manager of that road,
holding that position until July 1, 1887,
when he was made general manager of
the Wabash Western Railway, serving in
that capacity until July 1. 1SS9. From that
date until December 31, 1895. he was gen
eral manager of the Wabash Railroad
system, successor to the Wabash Western
and Wabash railways. He was also vice
president of that road from February 1,
1894. to December 31, 1S95. From January
1. 1S36, to December 15, 1900, he was gen
eral manager of the Grand Trunk Rail
way system, and on January 1, 1901, be
came president of the Southern Pacific
Company.
The following is a short history of Hays'
career as a railroad man: He was born
at Rock Island. 111., May 16, 1856, and en
tered the railway service November ! 10,
1S73. holding a position in the passenger
department of the Atlantic and Pacific
road at St. Lou!s until January 2, 1874.
From that date to March 9, 1S74, he spent
in the auditor's office, and from March '9,
1ST4. to January 1, 1S77. he served as clerk
In the general superintendent's office of
the same road.
Hays' Kailroad Career.
From absolutely authentic sources it is
learned that as soon as Hays decided
that his scalp would be taken he com
menced to make plans for some other
place for ' himself. His fancy turned to j
the Grand Trunk, his old love, and his
overtures to the controlling interests of
that organization being kindly received
he agreed to accept his old position as
soon as his connection with the Harrlman
people should have ceased.
C M. Hays, whose resignation as presi
dent of the Southern Pacific Company is
now in the hands of Harrlman, awaiting
the final action of that gentleman, has al
ready provided for his future. Upon
severing his connection with the Southern
Pacific he will return to the Grand Trunk
Railway as that road's vice president and
general manager. Much speculation has
been indulged in as to the possible future
of the gentleman whose career as the
head of a great corporation on this coast
has been so brief. The Call, which has
foretold all the incidents that have led
up to his retirement, is now in a position
to definitely state what will be the setting
of the final act In this comedy of the rails.'
