â¢ The most Important points brought out
In the inquiry were the conflicting state
ments, as to the .length t of time which
elapsed between the 6triklog of the; ship
and the final plunge or the vessej to the
bottom. Nearly all the witnesses placed
the time at from seven to ten minutes,
while Pilot Jordan nnd Chief Engineer
Herlihy' claim that ' twenty minutes
elapsed between the time the vessel went
on the rocks and the mornent when she
went to the bottom of the Golden Gate. -
\ It was also developed In yesterday's In
vestigation that though boat and firo
drills were frequent-! on the Rio de Ja
neiro they,, were .of 'little practical value
as the r - crew simply responded to the
alarm and went to' the various atatlons
assigned. -The boats were 'never moved

Â¦ The first 1^witness of the day was Third
Officer Charles J. Holland, ; and /his evi
dence was" In line with that presented by
him at the Coroner's investigation. ;
Boat Drills Useless,
The ; examination .', .'of *V Holland . chiefly
dwelt with' the question of boat and fire
drills, and it was brought out by the an
swers of the witness that In all the time
he had been en the Rio de Janeiro he had
never seen the ; life .boats swung from
their davits, and that they always : re
mained , In their- checks, ' The witness tvlt
ther testified to hearing long -blasts, of
distress' sounded- on the" Rio's ' whistles
before she went down, He was positive
Carpenter Frank Cramp was the most
important witness of the day. He was
suffering ' from severe hoarseness and
could hardly be -heard. Cramp testifled
that he examined the lifeboats of the Rio
before she started from tho Orient and
had found them In good order. He de
scribed the structure . of the wrecked
steamship and said that when she was
built all requirements of law had been
carried out. Â¦ The Rio had three complete
watertight compartments and two incom
plete bulkheads.' In the opinion of
Cramp the steamer had been cut open lr.
two of her complete compartments when
she ran* on the rooks, The witness testi
fied that after the ship struck he had
taken soundings in the- forward and after
holds and bad found ten and twenty-two
feet of water respectively, He so re
ported to. Captain Ward and. the captain
had ordered : him to his boat. The wlt-
Dr. A- A. O'Neill, surgeon of the Rio.
then took the stand. The doctor could
throw little light on the cause of the
wreck. He was In bed asleep when the
vessel struck and went to his boat when
the pilot and quartermaster on duty told
him to do so at the captain's orders. Dr.
O'Neill told of how he lowered his boat
and how the Rio sank,' in precisely the
same manner as he testifled before the
Coroner's Jury. The doctor placed the
time between the striking and sinking of
the Rio as being not more than seven
minutes. The witness did not think at. the
time that the ship was In danger, of sink-
Ing. ;; ; - . Â¦ :. v;i;;v./ "Â¦ 'Â¦
Doctor Gives Evidence.
Quartermaster Fred Matheson testified
that he was on watch below when thÂ» Rio
started, from her anchorage.' "WJjen- tho
Rip struck he went on deck and the cap
tain ordered him to his boat. The witness
felt sure -at the time of striking that the
Rio was hard on th<Â» rocks and that there
was little danger of her sinking. Mathe
son /believed that only five minutes
elapsed | from the tlmo tbe Rio' struck
until she sank. ii'..-. . :
/Qaartermaster Frederick LlndstroTi
testifled. that; tie was on the lookout of
the Rio from the time she started to enter
port until she struck, with the exception
of -a: few; minutes hÂ© spent In the pilot
house to get a cup of coffee. The witness
stated that* he heaved the lead after the
vessel struck, but could not get bottom.
When thÂ© witness bo Informed the pilot,
the latter .requested him to tell Captain
Ward to get his boats out and warn th3
passengers of their danger. ,
that the vessel sank- in. tea minutes after
going pri. the rocks. Holland was sure
that â¢Captain ; Ward did everything In his

Precipitates a Hot Debate and Leav-

â¢:Â¦ I v: to Reconsider. ''Â¦} . ' , â¢
CALL HEADQUARTERS, : SACRA
MENTO, March .1.â The Senate to-day
passed Ray's Assembly-: bill providing- for
the- location and construction of a State
highway from Merced Falls to the boun
dary of Yosemlte National Park. It was
not passed without a hot debate, even
then Leavltt changed from no to aye and
gave notice of a motion to reconsider.
The Finance Committee of the Senate
had before it road bills providing for ap
propriations amounting to $700,000. :lt was
determined to kill the bills In committee
for two reasonsâ because the road appro
priations; If they once started, would go
tp into the millions, and because under
the constitution the State cannot aid
county roads. Its only course is to de
clare a certain road a State highway, and
then the maintenance of the road becomes
a peimanent charge upon the State.
The Vosemite road bill provides for the
reapproprlatlon of $50,000 for" the construc
tion of the road, and the question under
discussion was whether or not It should
c?M t I cat f d ' : ' aB '' a new appropriation and
killed with the other road bills. It was
finally r>a^ed by a vote of 24 to 6, but
many of tte affirmative votes were cast
by Senators who have road bills of their
ovvn. and thty hoped if one went through
others might follow.
This evening another phase of the road
question came up Â«5n the constitutional
amendment Introduced byÂ» Smith of Kern.
His amendment provides that the State
may give aid to counties in the mainte
nance of county roads. The amendment
passed without negative votes.

Carter appeared beside the clock in full

his face, the row of clerks and Assembly
men at the , front desks greeted him with
a laugh that caused his speedy disappear

A : few- .minutes later the disconcerted
statesman came upon. the floor of the As
sembly, and as he walked to his seat he
glanced up surreptitiously at the gallery,
still looking for "Alice." Those who knew
of C6wan's Joke turned toward Carter
shaking with laughter, and presently the
whole Assembly was in an uproar as the
story was ; passed along. "Jim" Oliver
was calling the roll, on a passage of a
bill and his contortionist attempts to sup
press his laughter. added still further to
the general hilarity. /
Carter made no more speeches during

Is- asserted that 150 Canadian girls are en

fallen women must move outside cf the
city of Dawson by May 1. Klondike City

"But, in connection with this declara

made, and it is that the girls are not
free to leave. If they desire to do so. There
are 150 of these women who are actually
enslaved, and they belong by contract: to
seventy men. who are their "masters. : :
"These irirls are nearly all from East
ern Canada, who wore brought in under
contract. Many of these contracts, it is
said, were made by the girls' parents.
Some of the girls have considerable
money end probably will apply to the

tennis this year has a. very open look ami
with such men as Weihe, Hunt. Selby.

very high class.

practicing almost every . day. Hamilton,

Fearless Footsteps has again captured
England's rich Waterloo Cup stake, the
world's greatest coursing event. Fearless
Footsteps Js by Fabulous Forjune-Fllle d-Â»
Feu and is owned by J. Hartley Blbby,
secretary of the National Coursing Boai.l
of England. In repeating: her victory ot
a year ago the great courser furnished a
surprise. Her performance in the recent
stake was her first appearance on the fide*
this season, and in consequence the best
authorities of the game on the other side
gave her the overlook as a prospective
candidate for top honors in the big event.
Father o' Fire, her litter brother, was
the stake favorite at 100 to 12, and was
looked upon to reach the final by easy
stages. He is ttve lengths faster, than his
famous Sister, but his indifferent killing
inclination has kept him from winning
many Ptakes. . Fearless Footsteps Is a
beautifully b"uilt black ticked bitch and is
considered one of; the linest bench- show
hounds in the world. - Putting her record
aside, she Is capable of taking medals and

BERKETLET, March Lâ More than eighty
hard worfclng .men - are -competing for
track and field events at the University of
California. Many of these are, freshmen,
promising -.men, who 1 will develop "into
strong athletes by another season. Out
of this immense- squad there stand three
Ftarsâ Cadagan, the sprinter; Plaw, the
hammer thrower, and- Service, the dis
tance man: Â¦ Track Captain Walsh is, of
course, a winner in .his single specialty,
the mile wcilk, but as that event has been
tabooed In. good athletic circles, the win
ner-is npt,put,in the. "star list.".. There
are many other good men, for the ma
terial Is. particularly promising this' year.
The ra^n.' standing next to Cadogan in
the 100-yard dash are Asbill, a freshman,
from the- X.owell High School; Bishop,
Townsend, and Ugda. Mono of these is
parUculaorly fast. Each can do the event
in 10 3-5 'seconds. In the 220-yard- dash
the Earn* men. with possibly Squires, will
comyete. j Squires, Cadogan, Brown and
PoTwers are leaders in the 440-yard dash
Squfres li; a fast man.
In the ialf-mile California is particular
ly sxronr. Service holds the coast record
of l rainute 66 2-6 seconds. Bailey can- go
the SSO in a little over two minutes and
Clifford a few seconds slower. Macpher
son and Graves are freshmen who promise
much in the distances. Practically the
same men will run in the mile.
Hamlin, a sure, steady man, leads in
the high hurdles. Thomas, Powell and
Cheek are also doing good in that event:
In the 220 hurdles Woolsey of the Dental
College and Powell are putting Up fast
races. * -Woolsey may not be able to com
pete,, but he is picked as a winner in the
intercollegiate should be remain oh the
path. Â¦'
The mile walk is conceded to Track Cap
tain Walsh, who holds a record of 7 min
utes .24 seconds. -Shook, Stanford's best
man, docs the walk in something like 7
minutes 33 seconds. Glenn Allen Is walk
ing with Walsh and Delashmutt may
come out later.
Cheek and Cooley, both freshmen from
the Oakland High School, are strong in
the high Jump and Captain Walsh looks
for them to make Henley, the crack Stan
ford man, work hard for that event
should he enter it. Powell is showing up
well. He has^done 5 feet S inches, con
sidered good for the short time he -has
been In practice this season. ,

team, which hag been improving steadily

torlous Fireman's Fund nine on the Cali
fornia campus this afternoon.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 1 -
Work on the diamond and track was re
sumed at the beginning of the week after
a long suspension, caused by wet weather.
The first call for, track men resulted in
bringing out a large section of new talent.
The first year men are particularly .active
in the preparation for their first meet
with' the Oakland High School team on
March :16. Such men as Henley, Holman.
Thomas, Hamilton, Hyde, . Taylor arid
Lamb among the freshmen insure - that
this year's aggregation will be the strong
est that has represented Stanford for
years. â¢
Handball and tennis are both receiving'
.ni k a w Â°i a ! tentlon ' and tournaments
will be held the last of the week.
The work of the baseball men. despite
the setback caused by the weather, has
progressed quite satisfactorily. Thurs
day's game with Santa Clara showed the
infield in the best of form and the out
field not far behind. . The men, however,
lack the ability to connect with the ball at
critical times. Three different times the
bases were full, but the batter was un
able to land a hit that would advance the
runner a. peg. - .
The least hopeful outlook seems to toe
the development of a battery. Ball has
replaced Traeger behind the bat and does
good work at blocking, but Is weak in
getting the sphere down to bases. V> ith
more practice he may fill the position
satisfactorily. Hi3 batting record will be
In his favor. Parker and Trltch are the
leading candidates for the pitcher's box.
The latter, a freshman, loomed up as a
dark horse in yesterday's game. He has
speed, good control and some puzzling
curves. The outfleld will be greatly
strengthened ] by the return of I "Chet"
Murphy to the diamond. Murphy 4s a
sure hitter and probably the best base
runner that has slid for the cardinal since
the days of Abe Lewis. He will take his
place in center field for the fourth sea
son. . . ; :

The baseball season will open In thfs
city within four weeks, and the fanatics
are eagerly awaiting the day to Rive vent
to their pent up enthusiasm. With four
games a week and the best players In the
West on the various teams, the- followers
of the national game are assured of some
splendid sport. Managers are correspond
ing: and scurrying around the country for
gilt-edge material, and the teams that
will compose the California League will
be made up of very strong players.
Manager Harris of the San Franeiaeos
has been doing missionary work and he
says this city will be represented by an
aggregation hard to beat. He has secured
the services of eight men â¢ and Is now
negotiating for the ninth. Among thÂ«
players he has already signed are Gra
ham, Whalen and Fittpatrick. Graham
will be behind the bat. His catching Is ct
high order. He is a sure thrower to
second and has a good batting eye.
AVhalen is a strong pitcher. "Fireman"
Fitz is also- signed for box work. Ho
has a good record and a strong arm. Hla
voice has often been heard on the coacn
ing line, and in comparison "Brick'
Devercux's notes sound like a tin whistla
alongside a calliope. Harris is now search
ing fora third twlrler. Pabst. the tall first
baseman, who captained .last season's
team, will fill the initial bag this season.
He will also look after "your Uncle's"
colts. Schwartz or "Heiney" Krug will
play second base. Either man is certain
of a position on the team. One of them
will be shifted to right Held. Harris has
secured a strong man in Kane for short
stop.. The latter played that position for
Toledo last year and is said to be a won
der. Harris also expects to secure the
services of Fred Raymer for the third
bag. Raymer was with Pueblo last sea
son and has a fine record.
; Holland of Denver will be placed In tha
eft garden. He was one of the leading
i hitters of the Western League last sea
! son. Holland has played with the Dallas
I and Galveston nines of the Texa3 League.
' He signed with the Denver team last aea
1 son and led his team-mates in batting.
His average with the stick was .207. J.
Hale will play center field. Hale played
last season with the Schenectady team.
Xew York. He 13 another college boy
whose clever playing won him a place In
tae professional ranks. Whfle at Belolt
College he played on the varsity of *9GÂ«
"97-'S>&. In the latter part of '98 he played
with Minneapolis and led his team In
hitting with an average of .321. In '99 ha
played with Rock ford in the Interstate
League and his hitting average was .333.
In 1900 he played with the Schenectady
team and hit at .324. He is a left-handed
batter, has the reputation of being a goo-l
bunter, is fast on bases and fields with
unerring eye. He Is 23 years of age,
stands five feet ten Inches In height ana
weighs 1*5 pounds.
The members of the 3an Francisco team
will report for practice on March 12. Tha
team will play morning and afternoon and
when the season opens on March 31 tho
aggregation will be in fine fettle. Man
ager Harris intends arranging' practice
games for his team. Santa Clara. College
â¢ and other college nines will be invite J
to try the mettle of the local men.
A contract has been let out for repair
ing the grounds. The boxes over the grand
stand will be taken down and nlaced Im
mediately behind the press or scorer' Â«t
box, which will be advanced about ten
feet. The boxes will be placed on an In
cline and the "elect" will have a much
better view of the games.
Swindell has signed with Oakland and
Los Anxeles. Both teams now claim him
and It will be necessary for the league to
arbitrate in the matter.
Oakland, San Francisco, Sacramento
and Los Angeles will have teams In tha
league. Games -will be played every
Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
afternoons.
Los Angeles Is negotiating with Lerwep
of Denver to play third. He is said to bÂ©
a first-class man. Manager J. F. Moriey
of the Los Angeles team has signed
"Hank" Spies for catcher. "Hank" Is wel
known to the "fan?." He was backstop
for Sacramento In '90 and caught for
Frisco in '91. Since then he has been
catching for Milwaukee in tYe American
Association. Moriey has also signed
Hutchinson for first base. Kelly and Bow
man for third and outfield. Donlin ar.d
Steinfeldt have both sinned, but there is
some doubt of their remaining here.
Manager Beebe r>t Sacramento ha 1 *
signed Hanlon for first base. Harper for
pitcher, Stanley for backstop, Sheehan for
infield and Courtney. He la now negotiat
ing with Eastern players and expects to
put forth a pennant-wti>nlng nine.
Manager Beetw? has been sued by Kripp
for possession of the ball ground* of tin
Capital City.- In the event that Krlpp la
successful in his suit it is Beebe's Inter.-
' # tion to build new grounds.

SAN DIEGO.
.' SAX DIEGO. March 1.â By a score of 5
to 4, San Diego again defeated \the San
Bernardino team to-day in one of the
prettiest games : played here . since the
opening. of tho schedule. This was par
ticularly true. of the last three or four
innings, when the visitors tried persist
ently to make a tie score, but failed
through the excellent play of the home
team, Devereaux was on the slab for the
locals and Jones of Arizona officiated for
the visitors. Neither pitcher walked a
man, though each was batted freely The
San Diegana earned four of their five runs
and the visitors three of their four. Doyle
hurt his wrist in the last part of the ninth
inning and Taylor came in from the field
and played out the game at first. The

NEWS FROM THE KENNELS
After an apparently Interminable delay,
which seems In' a large measure to' have
been due to the procrastination of the
secretary of the club, the bench show
committee has selected tho Jiidg-es for;the
coming. tloK show. The gentlemen named
are James Lynn of rort Huron and Henry
Jarrett of Philadelphia, two well known
.Eastern .fanciers. â¢: 'Â¦ â¢'. .--. "Â¦ : '
The former . gentleman.. Is widely re
nowned Â»s a.breedÂ«r of all kinds of ter
riers and - also of mastiffs and. St. Ber
nards, while Mr. Jarrett haa equal fame
with his collier, pointers, setters and a
miscellaneous lot of other breeds, - of
which he. has made a lifelong study. It
is said, that as a Judge of cocker BpanlelS
Mr. Jarrett has not an equal In this coun
try. It is undoubtedly, a step in the right
direction that the club Is now making In
engaging the services of two Judges In
stead of one, as heretofore, and the ma
jority of fanciers will be pleased with this .
improvement. It is, however, a pity that
the bench . show committee should be
hampered In its efforts for a progressive
show by a secretary who evidently con
eiders that the chief part of his duties is.
to cast the mantle of secrecy over the
proceedings of the club, which is, after
all. a auasl-public body.
The California Cocker Club held a meet
ing on Tuesday Â¦Â¦ evening. J. H. Dorian
presiding, in the absence of President.

president In place of A. Edwards, re

HANDBALL GAMES BY
SKILLED PLAYERS
i The handball tournament now on at the
Olj-mple Club Is drawing to a close. The
games last night' were highly exciting and
drew upon the "endurance of the athletes.
In the first class the flght .for first and
second places has \ narrowed, down to
Bogen (40) and Powers (40), and In the
second class to Johnson, McLeod and
Levy.
Bogen and Powers' played their- first
semifinal contest last night and the for
mer won by a score of 61 to Powers" .4.
They will play again Sunday afternoon
and it is almost a foregone conclusion
that Bogen will win the gold medal in his
class. ' .. - Â¦-*. 'â¢
In the' second class- the three scratch
men proved themselves the better play
ers. Johnson, MeUeod" and Levy went
through. the tournament, defeating all
Â¦who were pitted against them, and are
now Btrusrgllnj? ' for Â¦ first and second
medals. Last night Johnson defeated Mc-
Leod ' by a pcore of 51 to. 31. The game
was closer: than: the score would indicate.
McL*od played a strong game and made
some brilliant "kills.';
On Sunday afternoon JohnsVm will -meet
Levy. If the former defeats Levy he will
be entitled to the prold medal. On the oth
er hand, if Levy defeats Johnson, he will
wear the shining reward on his puffed
up Chest. Â¦ : : 'Â¦. Â¦:Â¦-â¢'-. ' '- , . .

CHI'S RACING FORM CHART
FOR high-class work In the saddle
"Winnie O'Connor has been blan
keting 1 all his brother jockeys at
Tanforan. The climax to his suc
cessful riding came yesterday
when he piloted five out, of six mounts
for first money. While some of tne great
est jockeys of the country have been
made the targets for the- censure- . and
jeering disapprobation of , the race-goer3
â¢at Tanforan, O'Connor has been
constantly applauded and cheered. ) â¢
And O'Connor does not always -sit upon
the favorite. Jlis^flrst mount yesterday
was Fondo at 2 to 1. the second choice.
Then came Constable, 5 to 1. Nansen
was the third victory and the price on the
horse was. 4 to 1. In the four-cornered
race O'Connor had the leg on- Autumn,
an even-money favoritei Then came the
fifth race, the only one in which O'Con
nor's riding failed to secure first money.
He rode The i Phoenician, the favorite,
and landed in the show. In the last race
O'Connor was .mounted on Benson Cald
well, made favorite only on account of
O'Connor's being In the saddle.-
Ou t o f Six Races He R ides Five for Fi rst Place
and Gets the Show With the Other.

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART
By Louis Ho ni g.
-r^ -rÂ» -pINNIE O'CONNOIVS riding
i\ / was the individual feature of
'A/^V/ the racing at Tanforan yes-
V V terday._ Kive out of six races
were captured by horses on
which he was mounted, and he was on
top of favorites only in two InFtances.
Henry, astride the favorite. Quiz II. re
ceived a bombardment of Jeers and hisses
when he dismounted before the judges'
stand after the first race, six and a half
furlongs, selling. The crowd didn't like
the way he rode Quiz up the backstretch
and expressed Its noisy disapproval with
out check. Fondo, the second choice,
with Winnie O'Connor up, had the race
from the start to finish and won handily.
Quiz came in l'or the show, and that was
alL
After a bad start the field of six two
year-olds got off, with Constable in the
lead. Again O'Connor was mounted on
the 'winner, a 5 to 1 Bhot. and he piloted
Louis Ezell's entry . under the wire,
Yrsula and Sir Claus neck and neck be
hind, all three driving. Loulette* Burns
up, was practically left at the post. â¢
Xansen carried the lirst money right to
the fireside in the mile, and a sixteenth,
the third race, and Winnie O'Connor
again received the hand. Tommy Burns
was mounted on the favorite. Topmast,
and the place 'was all that came his way.
Vain gave them all a chase up the back
stretch and made his own chance at win
ning very slim, for the others pasBed
right along after the last turn, when Vain
seemed to have -mucilage on his hoofs.
Autumn showed a little form yesterday,
and with O'Connor in the pilot box. came
into port in very clever fashion. Specific
and Gonfalon, with Bums and Henry on
top, cut out a fair clip over the first part
of the six furlongs. O'Connor held Au
tumn well behind, and when the paddock
was reached began driving hard. The
finish between Autumn, . Gonfalon and
Specific was a hot one, all three driving.
The fifth race, six furlongs, distin
guished from the others because it was
the one In which O'Connor did not have
the winner, was ridden in the fog and
was the property "of Kitty Kelly, the sur
prise of Thursday. Alee, with Thorpe up,
took the lead, but at the stretch Kitty
Kelly showed her speed and passed in
first. The Phoenician, O'Connor up, grot
the enow, i
Benson Caldwell went the mile route in
the last race as if it meant torwtn. Un
der Winnie O'Connor's guidance Benson
took the lead at the start and was never
distanced. Artcna and William Ack came
In for the place and Bhow.
AT OAKLAND TRACK
By F. E. Mulholland
OVER at Oakland track yesterday
a good sized crowd viewed some
excellent sport, the feature of
which was the brilliant riding of
Johnny Bullman. Tho Montana
boy flnlehed first on Meehanus. Scotch
Plaid and Gibraltar and twice passed the
wire on place horaes. Little Doroinlck
was also in splendid form, piloting two
winners, and on three occasions getting
hia mount past the Judges in. second posi
tion. Favorites In the betting performed
.creditably, thrice being led into the win
ners' circle.
None of the starters in the first event,
a five and a half furlong sprint for maid
ens, could be accused of possessing much
class. John Welch, with Domlnlck up,
was finally backed down to 13 to 5 favorit
ism and In a hard drive only lost out by
a noae to Gold Finder. Materne, quite a
promising boy, rode the winner, whicn
was 4 to 1 in the ring. Canejo, a 30 to 1
shot, would have scored with any sort of
fair racing luck, coming from, far back
and talcing the show.
Nearly everybody had Barney Schrei
ber's fast filly, Zlrl, picked out as one of
lhe real good things of the card. With
Bullman on her back the black, miss went
to the post an even money choice for the
two-year-old spin. Away In front at tha
start, the Schrelber colors headed the van
to within a few yards from the .goal,
where Domlnlck, astride Inocencla. came
with a. rush, winning by a head. Tj-ranus
showed to poor advantage, tne show go
ing to KlUdoe, from the Burns & Water
house string.
Apparently outclassing his field shoes to
plate. Meehanus. now racing In the colors
of Caesar Young, fell In for strong sup
port in the speculating done on the third
number. Bullman had the chestnut horse
in front before many yards had been cov
ered and, under restraint at * the close,
downed Boundlee two lengths. By a. lib
eral application of the whip Howell land
ed third place with Herculean. Scally
wag ran disappointingly. Tame Irishman
appeared to be running wild again. Tho
Light ran a very creditable race consid
ering the weight carried, only tiring Â¦with
the wire in sight.
As Morlnrel had not been distinguishing
herself of late and with Torsina all gone
to rack and ruin Scotch Plaid looked a le
gitimate favorite for the mile and a six
teenth selling affair 'Â¦ It proved easy
money, for, after trailing along behiud
Norford into the stretch. Bullman let out
a wrap and Plaid came in "on the bit."
Basslnger made a mess of It with Mori
net. the little mare finishing up in the
show. Torsina ran la3U
Over his fit of the sulks apparently,
Gibraltar turned the tables on the other
three starters In the filth event, finishing
first, two lengths In advance of Good
Hope. The laet named mare had a decid
ed call in the betting, but could not run
the big black horse down. There was no
scarcity of 2Vt to 1 about the winner
around post time. Mocorito blew in fif
teen lengths before Tlburon for show
honors. . . > Â¦
St. Wood, another Bulker. attached him
self to the last purse. A 2 to 1 choice, h*
collared ilontanus on the way in. beat
ing him a length. Alaria and Jennie Reid
indulged in a stiff argument for the third
position, the former securing it by a
neck. .:. :Â¦ Â¦ ' '. Â¦ ..Â¦Â¦ ;; Â¦ ". Â¦'.'Â¦ .--. 'Â¦ /.. f;

AT TANFORAN TRACK
Favorites Are Still in Bad Odor at TanforanâJockby Henry Is Hissed
After His Ride on Quiz II in the First Race on the Card.
The enterprise of .the Oakland 'Golf.-
Club In offering the sum of 1200 in prize*.
for a professional tournament deserved a -
better reward yesterday than It received/
Only half a dozen professionals entered .
the lists, - and, despite 1 the beautiful
weather, hardly, fifty spectators followed .
the players. .The course was In good con
dition, though rather heavy. In spmo.
low lying spots standing water somewhat .
interfered.' The putting greens were slow.
as was evidenced by the fact that several
excellent- putts stopped an, inch or two
short of the cup. Horace Rawllna and his
brother Harry, who are more familiar
with the course than any of the other â¢
contestants, had especially hard luck in
this particular. Willie Smith, though he
was playing the course for the first time,
gave a splendid display of golf, handing
in a score of 40. 39. total 7!*. for. the :
eighteen holes. This Is only two strokes :
higher' than the record for the course
made by -Horace Rawllns about .a year
ago. Horace Rawlins was second, with a
score of S8; Harry Rawllns third wtÂ»h K>:
David Bell fourth with !>O: F. : J. Rilev
fifth with 95k. and Robert Johns tone sixth
with 96. David Bell's score was Increased
by the fact that the eleventh hole cost
him eight strokes, while Robert Johnstone
required eight for the second and seven
for the eighth. Willie Smith .player!: a.
strong gam* throughout, his drives being -
long and straight, his brassie shots clean
and his approaching and putting accur
ate. His two rounds Included on.lv. two
sixes, at the third and thirteenth holes..
In each round he made the ninth in three. â¢
F. J. Rlley was handicapped by the fact
that he is accustomed to sand greens and
was consequently unfamiliar with thÂ«
comparative slowness of turf.* The full
details are given In the table:* Â¦-/Â¦;.'

WITNESSES AND JURORS.
JUSTICE BREWER in a recent address at Yale
dealt with legal subjects with something^like a
free hand. He spoke more like a -cformer than
a Judge, and has started lively discussions by reason
of the severity of some of his criticisms of the prac
tices of our judicial proceedings.
Two of his statements have been especially noted.
In one he declared: "The jury system as at present
administered is little more than a relic of- a semi
barbafous age." In the other he pronounced severe
judgment upon the latitude allowed to lawyers in ex
rmining witnesses, and upon the general treatment of
witnesses by the courts. Â»
Both of these criticisms have met with favorable
comment It is well known that we select jurors more
for what they do not know than for what they do
know, and that after impanelment the jufor is vir
tually a prisoner. He is treated as if he were under
suspicion from first *o last, and not infrequently has a
harder time than the prisoner accused of crime.
It is the woes of witnesses, however, that have
mainly engaged attention. .The poor witness is not
only subject to almost every form of exa'speratici:
when on the witness-stand, but not infrequently has.
to endure imprisonment as welL It is stated that a
New York Grand Jury recently had occasion to re
port that witnesses -before the courts in that city have
been detained in prison for upward of twd months,
while the accused persons against whom they were
expected to testify had been released on bait and were
enjoying full liberty. . ;V> .
It is to be noted that neither Justice Brewer, nor
any of those who commend his utterances offers any-,
thing in the way of a remedy for the evils they com
plain of. The subject cannot become one of practical
reform until some feasible remedy has been advanced
for discussion. No doubt both jurors and witnesses,
are often badly treated under our present system of
legal procedure, but it is difficult to see how .any grer.t
change could be effected in the system without causing
greater evils still
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION
QNE of the more important measures now be
fore the Legislature is Senate bill 282, which.
> while dealing with the duties of the State and
the county Boards of Education, has a special bearing
on the methods by which teachers' certificates may ba
obtained. The aim of the bill is to provide a higher
and more uniform test of fitness on the part of the
applicants for certificates. Consequently it affects the
whole public school system and aims at greatly im^.
proving its usefulness 10 the community by raising the
standard of the teaching force. ; : ..
At the present time county Boards of Education
are authorized to grant teachers' certificates of high
school grade to graduates of the University of Cali
fornia and of any other institution of learning in the
United States which the 6tate Board' of Education
may have recommended as of equal grade. County
boards have also the right to examine applicants for
high school certificates and to grant them if the ap
plicants pass the examination in a manner satisfactory
to the board. It is at that point the present system
is weak. The examinations made by the' boards of
the different counties <;re not uniform, and arc often
inadequate to constitute a genuine test of the merit
of- the applicant. In fact, it frequently happens that
not a single-member o.'a county^ Board of Education
which examines applicants for high school certificates
has ever qualified for a high school teacher or even
knoxs what such qualifications should be.
The' desirability of a uniform system of examina
tions and a common standard of fitness", for teachers
dannot be questioned. At the present time iio two
counties have the same standard. To remedy Ibe 'evil
the bill now before the Legislature provides that all
high school, certificates shall be granted on credentials
prescribed by the State Board of Education. This
does not mean that no teachers will be eligible except
the graduates of the institutions designated by the
board. Speciar provision is made for granting cre
dentials to experienced teachers who do not HoW such
diplpmas, but it is stipulated that in such special cases
the 'standard of qualification shall not be lower than
that" represented by the other credentials nafiied by
the board. ' : v : 'v :?
Another commendable feature of .the bill is that it
provides for putting an end to the distinction which
now prevails between the qualifications of primary
and those of grammar grade teachers by . requiring
the same standard for both' certificates. Here, again,
the standard is to be made uniform throughout the
State, so that the benefits to be derived will be an ad
vanced standard for primary teachers throughout the
whole school system and a consequent increased effi
ciency in the teaching force.
It is to be noted nnally that. the measure has been
carefuUy drawn up by a State Educational Commis
Â«>ion composed of persons fully qualified to deal with
Our legislators at Sacramento have given us an ex-.

A WILSON CHAIR.
f j ASHINOTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY
\\f at Lexirrgton, Va., sustains an important rela
tion to the new South. That university has
from the first encouraged the work organized at
Hampton Institute, Virginia,. for solution of the race
problem by industrial training of the negro, and the
larger work on the tame line so successfully ami
svisely maintained by Booker T. Washington at Tus
kegee, Ala. In other words, Washington and Lee
University, distinctly Southern, is clearly philosophi
cal in its view of the solution of a race problem that
highly concerns the whole country. . ; . '. : . Â¦ Â¦â¢ - : Â¦
To the presidency of that institution went the late
William L. Wilson '*t the close of his public duties
as Postmaster General, after long and useful service,
in the House of Representatives. His public career
had impressed him with the heed of sound education
in the principles of scientific finance, for he was a
sound money man, and when>uneducatcd public sen
timent in his State presented to him the choice to
stand whh it or fall with sound: money he chose to
When he became president of the university he
found it with no chair of finance and economics, and
of his o;vn slender rnean 5 founded such a chair and
maintained it untir his' death. Â¦' -. ' -. . .'..-'.
His friends, such, 'men' as Abram. S. Hewitt and
George Foster Peabody, "have undertaken to raise an
endowment' of $100,000 for that. Chair which he
founded to maintain it in perpetuity as a memorial to
him. As it appeals to the sound money -sentiment of
the country it is, probable' that the memory of. this
steadfast man will be honored and perpetuated. The
secretary of the fund is Mr. Herbert Welsh, 1305 Arch
street, Philadelphia, and already $jo,ooo has been sub
scribed. .'-"Â¦Â¦ - ".
It is quite worth while to set the example of such
a monument to our public men.' 'Â¦ . Â¦
GETTING AN APPROPRIATION.
WHEN.^ the various .comniitte.es of the Honse
have price ;made up their : appropriatioh bills: it
! is; not easy' for. a member, to get a new appro
priation added to; the list -by afn^hdrhent when the
measure comes before the \yhple House. That idifli-
?eyery:.6^siotf^^!i^m^tc4 : at
the present one by reaspn of the very; heavy: appro-"
priations made -by .the various committees; Neverthe
less Mri Allen (oi /Mississippi managed Â¦ to. ;^et : as
much as $io,oob. appropriated to establish a : ftsh
hatchery at Tupelo. Now; as there' are many, men
who believe that ability to get appropriations is the
highest order of statesmanship, it will be worth while
to point put how Mr. Allen succeeded.- : . . . .' . \
. â¢;â¢ A carefiil reading of his twenty-minute speech on
the question, â¢ as ...published in the Cqngressionai
Riccord,: reveals the fact that he- made, no argument
at all; . He began by saying there are a good many
members of the House who . neyer heard of Tupelo,
and that he would give them, the . informatipn they,
needed. -. Thereupon he }Â¦ went on to say: ''When
Christopher . Qolumbus had .his interview with
Ferdinand : : Isabella of .; Spain, .in his ef-'
forts to persuade.; them to. .'back ; him in. his
expedition. -that, led -to the discovery, of:Amer,
ici,.--. he asVured them, that; an atlrwise. Creator,
creating.a world like this, was bound to have made
soniewhere near : its center such a \ place as Tupelo."
Proceeding in that, vein he said..Ponte de . Leon did
not . explore American wilds for the sake of discov
ering gold or. the fountain of youth, but to find
Tupelo; that the great rivalry of the British; French
and Spanish for possession of the Mississippi country
was due mainly to the desire of each to. own. Tupelo;
that President Lincoln opposed the secession of the
Southern States mainly because the movement took
Tupelo out of. the Union. : : . ..
.Warming to this theme Mr. Allen went on: "Many
of you gentlemen have never been to Tupelo. I|hjppe
none of you entertain the idea of dying before, going
there. I should hate to have it said of. any member
of this Congress â for all of whom I have a kindly
feelingâ that they did not* aspire to visit Tupelo be
fore they died. I extend you. all an invitation to
come, and promise you a royal welcome. Come.an'd
go. with me. on College'. .;Hill some evening and se<i
one of our Tupelo sunsets. Come and . see one of
our Southern silvery Tupelo moons, I think it is.the.
only place in the South where, we haye the same beau-,
tiful moons we had .before the war." . -' .
The only thing Mr: Allen had to say about the fish
hatchery and the appropriation was thus summed up
in his peropation: "This> Mr. Chairman' is a propo
sition, to establish there a fish hatchery. .Why, sir,
fish will travel overhand for miles to get- into the
water- we. have at Tupelo. Thousands of millions of
unborn fish are clamoring to this Congress .to-day
for. an opportunity tcj be hatched at the Tupelo hatch
ery. Now I only wish to say. in conclusion that if
there is a member here who wishes' to have his name
connected by future' generations with that' of. Judas
Iscariot and Benedict Arnold, : if he wishes' to be de
spised by. men and shunned by women, let him vote
against' this amendment and he will obtain-all that in
famous notoriety." . .V \ ' Â¦' -.
In all of that there is nothing of argument and but
little of wit; Great, however, .is. the power of genial
humor" in a crowd, of dull and brain-fagged men.
We are told in the Record the speech was frequently
interrupted by. "loud laughter and applause!;" In the
end the amendment was agreed to without a division.
Mr. Allen's twenty minutes of. fooling has thus cost
the. United States treasury. $20,600, or $1000 a min
nte, which is big. pay".; / â¢ â¢ . Â¦ â¢ ; . â¢' .
The moral 'of the lesson is^ plain. â¢ If. you would have
an appropriation send to- Congress some fellow who
can make the.Hou'se laugh. : The constituency' that
has a. smiling Representative can itself smrle.; ;: r
The people of the Middle West States appear to
consider that lynching is one of the fine- arts which is
likely to be lost if it be not assiduousiy indulged.

ONCE more the accuracy and reliability of the
news reports cf The Call have been demon
strated in tKe face of adverse criticism. ". In col
lecting all information bearing. upon the wreck of the
Rio The Call pointed out that the fearful loss of life
in the disaster was largely^ due. to the failure of the
crews at the life-saving station to go promptly to the
relief of the passengers on the sinking ship. It was
stated by The Call that the failure of action on the
part of officers and men at the station could be ac
counted for only on the ground of negligence. That
view was disputed at the time, but it has now been
completely verified; by the ; confession ' _ of : Mark El
lingson, who was on watch at. the lookout station
when the accident occurred.* .'He has how admitted
that he heard the signals of distress but did not notify
the station until it was too late for any effective relief
to be given. ''.-Â¦''.'
When The Call made the charge of negligence it
was not dealing in guesswork..; It collected informa
tion from officers and soldiers at the Presidio show
ing that the signal whistles of the sinking ship were
plainly heard by them; Â¦ that Jhe whistles were so loud
and clear they aroused perso*ns xvho were asleep.
Such being the facts, it was certain the lookout must
have heard, them if he possessed the sense of hearing,
and consequently his failure to report them could have
been due to nothing else than deafness or negligence.
Now deaf men are not employed for such duties as
those imposed upon a 'lookout .by the life-saving sta
tion, and the presumption o} negligence was therefore
a moral certainty. ' .
In the gathering snd dissemination of news the
most valuable element is that of accuracy. As Speaker
Reed once said, "It is better for men not to know so
much than to know so many things that are not so."
The Call does not. seek to attract readers by fakes or
exaggerations, but by furnishing news that can be re
lied upon. . Again and again it has demonstrated the
accuracy of. reports which when first published were,
met by denial. This new instance is but one of many
similar cases, and we refer to it particularly only be
cause the magnitude of th-e disaster out '.of. which the
report grew renders every fact connected with it a
matter of. general interest. : : 'Â¦'.'Â¦ :
The lesson to hi drawn from this as well as from
the whole course of the newspaper work : .in this city
is that those who wish to have all the news promptly
arid accurately must. leadThe Call/ Its reports' are
carefully made, and the public can reiy upon them..

LYNCH LAW
THE lynching record of this country gets blacker
as it grows longer. A singular ferment works in
the American mind. The making of the laws
and their enforcement are entirely in the charge and
keeping of the people. If the criminal laws arc in
sufficient, if the lightness of the penalty, they provide
offers a "premium on crime, the people can change
that; they can, increase penalties, and they, can
lengthen the list of penal offenses. If the penalties al
ready provided are not enforced the fault is with
the people, who through the operation of the jury
system participate directly in the administration of the
criminal law. At no part of our system of criminal
jurisprudence are the people excluded. Â¦â¢ They domi
nate the making and the execution of the law. Un
der such circumstances it is marvelous that they more
and more interfere with legal processes, and, taking
the law into, their own hands, execute upon offenders
what they conceive to be justice by lynching. The
system'is rapidly going beyond punishment for crime,
and is coming into vogue as the means of enforcing
a public policy. In this way it is used to expel"
Italians from parts of the South and Japanese and
Chinese from localities where they are not wanted,
though they are distinctly protected by treaty. â¢
Formerly lynching was performed by men in masks,
or whose identity was concealed by darkness . or
smudged faces. In those primitive days the victims
were hanged as quic*kly and quietly as possible,
being permitted to pray or make 'a speech, and when
it was over the executioners were glad to disappear
and leave the body to the Coroner.
But now all that is changed. No masks are used,
nor is the cover of darkness sought by these mobs.
They go at their work boldly and openly. Hanging
is rapidly going out of fashion. Burning at the stake
is the popular method. The crowd stays and piles on
the fuel, and then struggles and fights for pieces of
the victim's flesh and bones for souvenirs.
These tlijngs are done by daylight, as openly as the
same crowd would meet at a Sunday.-school picnic*
It is a far cry from the processes of Lynch, the Vir
ginia farmer, who used to tie up petty offenders and
flog them without appealing to the law, and so gave
his name to this sort of thing, to these days of burn
ing at the stake, mutilation and other evidences of
savagery. Â¦'; ';". 'V // . ..:' : .' Â¦' Â¦
Formerly these breaches of the law were on the
frontier, or in new tommunities where institutions
were not yet crystallized. : But now they occur in
differently, in/the older States and new settlements
alike. One. would take Indiana to be old enough for
respect for the processes of the law to be: deep-seated
and* immovable, but there, within a few days, a mur
derer was taken from the officers and handed, and
then his body was burned, while relic hunters in the
audienct offered a dollar apiece for his toes and boys
ran into the edge oj the fire and used their pocket
knives to cut off toes ard sell them. : * Â¦ :
These things disquiet an observer. What, is in the
marrow of society? Such affairs are unknown in the
British colonies or other colonies; elsewhere, though
inhabited by people of the. same stock. . ' . . ;â¢].

tiplicity of details involved, the taking of
the census. Is- a . taek-in 'itself : simple
enough. > It includes, as has been Bald,
first,, the collection of the . requisite data
in such form as to admit of an arithmet
ical statement of results; second, count
ing, and. finally the tabulation and publica
tion of the figures obtained. The principal
difficulty to be overcome is In laying out
the -work or in making the necessary
plans and preparations. Insufficient time
was allowed for. this preliminary stage of.
the "york. Â¦ Nevertheless more was accom
plished between March 4, 1S99. and Juna 1,
1900,. than in. the same portion of any pre
vious decade, and it is to the greater thor
oughness of preparation, suggested by
prior experience, that the success of the
present census is largely due. â¢.-':".. .
Some of the novel features of the
census may. here be mentioned. --.,Â¦ . ' .-.Â¦
. The act provided for.the appointment of
a larger number of supervisors, of whom
there wore 300, while in IS90 there were
. btft 150. . It also Increased their compensa
tion from $500 to an amount not less than
$1000, which was further increased by. an
amendatory, act by the addition in certain
cases of a sum not less than $250. It la
etlll inadequate to secure the highest ca
?aclty, attention ' to duty and efficiency,
n the administration of the office greater
liberality was exercised In the allowance
of Â¦ necessary assistance to. the supervisors,
especially In cities... where they were given
special agents to aid them. In the instruc
tion of enumerators and the inspection of
their work in the field.; Â¦ .'â¢ '. â¢ â¢
For the -first time a .systematic effort
was made to instruct the supervisors in
their duties, orally-, by groups, and riot
merely in print .and . by personal- corre
spondence as heretofore.' The success of
the undertaking was such as to susrerest
its extension . to the enumerators In the
larger cities and In come- counties at the
county seats. This method will doubt
less be followed on a far- more extensive
scale in" 1910. The testimony of the su
pervisors to its value is unanimous and is
supported by. a comparison of results
where it was and where it was not fol
lowed. â¢ Orfe supervisor reports that he
had to return ten schedules to-unlnstruct
e.d enumerators for one to such as had
attended a preliminary school of oral in
struction. . â¢
The Test Schedule for Enumerators.
Â¦ A most important and valuable innova
tion' in the organization of the twelfth
census was the "test- schedule" for the
elimination, of incompetent applicants for
the position- of enumerator, many of whom
have strong lofcal political backing. This
test was afjplled.in the form of a "narra
â¢ tive." describing an imaginary group of
families to be enumerated, which the ap
plicant was required to convert Into a
tabular statement upon a regular blank
schedule such as was actually used In the
subsequent enumeration of the population
accompanied by a certificate that the ap
plicant did the work himself without as
sistance. These test schedules were ex
amined first by the supervisors, who were
thus enabled to sift out from among trie
candidate's such as were incompetent or
Inferior. After they had made their selec
tions the schedules filled by the success
ful applicants were forwarded to "Wash
ington for a second examination, which
resulted in the rejection of many more
The average character of the service was
by this means elevated to a far higher
standard than would otherwise have been
possible. The schedule further served a"
an educational agency of great Value
compelling the attention of each enumer
ator to his printed instructions and re
vealing by the errors made the points In
which he was deficient and need#d further

say, SCO clerks and other employes. It Ia
well lighted and warmed, but poorly ven
tilated. Neither is it of adequate siae,
since It accommodates not more than two
thirds of tho force, and it has been found
necessary to rent a number of other
buildings for their use in various parts of
the city.'"- This- could *not be. avoided. In
view of the size of the lot at the disposal
of the office; and, besides, It was deemed
unwise to pay the interest demanded on
the investment for- a term of five years or
more, when the census act provides for
the completion of the four principal re
ports In two years. Should the office be
made permanent, aa It ought to be. and
a special Government building be provided
for its permanent occupation, these con
siderations would not apply. In the lan-
Government much more than this, since
so many other elements of loss are in
volved. But at $60,000 a year a bulldins
to cost $250,000 woulfl pay for Itself in four
years and thereafter thsre would -be no
charge for rent. .
This was not apparent to Congress when
the bill for an act to provide for the
twelfth census was in preparation. It
does not appear that these considerations
were presented to Us attention. Under
the existing conditions, the only possible
escape from tho situation was a contract
with capitalists for the erection of a
building upon plans prescribed by tho di
rector, at private cost, to be leased by
the office for a term of five years. In order
to reimburse the contractor for his neces
sary outlay.- This was done and the Gov
ernment has reaped the benefit of the ar
rangement. Much difficulty was experi
enced in the effort to find .a Bits and &
man- who would risk so much money in
a somewhat doubtful experiment. The
amount invested in the building alone is
about $120,000. It U a cheap, temporary
structure of brick, wood and glass, not
fireproof (with the exception of a large
vault containing the population sched
ules), for the most part one story in

scattering the force In different buildings

eerlous In the way of loss of time, loss
of efficiency, difficulty of aupervlsion and
control and cost of transportation of pa
pers and material. *No private corporation
would conduct Its business In so slipshod
a fashion. The Importance of minute sav
ings In a business of such magnitude may
be illustrated by tho following easy cal
culation: The census day is neven hours
longâfrom 9 to 4 o'clock; or, allowing half
an nour for recess and luncheon, six and
a half hours, or 290 minutes. If each clerk
should lose on an average qf ten minutes
a dayâ five at the beginning -and five at
the close â the total loss of time, assuming'
that there are 3000 employed, would be
30,000 minutes, which Is equivalent to one
day's work of seventy-seven clerks. At
the prices paid for services this means a
pecuniary loss to the Government of about
$50,000 a year. The Jack of a special and
permanent building probably costs the

1 Â¦:Â¦' . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE CENSUS.
Taking tho decennial^ census of the
United States is one of the most difficult
tasks assigned to. any. Government offi
cial. Thin. is not because of any Inherent
complexity in the work Itself, On the con
trary, three things the - director of the
census has to do: To obtain certain facts
in puch form that they can be counted, to
count them and to tabulate and publish
the result. The facts to be collected are
specified In the census act. He has no dis
cretion In the matter further than rojat6s
to details. The itct provides the requisite
fundrf and confers the necessary authority
and powers. The rest is merely a ques
tion, of methods and of executive ability-
Executive abillty'ls the first quality to be
sought in the selection of a director, since
he can employ expert assistance- in the
planning of the. work; but a technical ex
pert without executive force and skill
would prove a complete failure In charge
of the office. â¢ . . â¢
. What, then, are the circumstances
which render the enumeration, of our peo
ple and resources such an exceptional. y
difficult undertaking?
In the tlrat place Its magnitude. Few
people, however well informed, realize
that for Its accomplishment the Govern
ment needs the services of "300 Supervisors,
more than 50,000 enumerators, 20u0 special
agents In the field and 3000 or 3500 clerks
in Washington. Few are able to imagine
the vaatn'ess of our territory, the sparse
ness of the population in certain portions
of it and what it means to find 76,000,000
people at their homes. The' very concep
tion of a million is beyond- the mental
grasp of a mind unaccustomed to deal
with figures upon a large scale. Still more
rare is it to find one who has any ade
quate notion of the amount of labor in
volved in preparation for the census, In
gathering up the necessary data, and in
handling the material collected; the mul
titude of details .to be considered, the
number and kind of facilities to be pro
vided, the instructions tÂ» be given, the
discipline to be exercised, the financial re
sponsibility for such lar^e expenditures,
the risks of all sorts which the director
must assume.
Preparing to Take the Census,
The key to the situation is found in the
dominant fact that the work of the census
office is not continuous, but intermittent.
In this respect it differs from that of
every other official bureau. Once. in ten
years an army of employes has. to be re
cruited, trained, assigned to duty, driven,
controlled and discharged. This force
gathers like an avalanche, then dissolves
and disappears like drifted snow in the
heat of the sun in early spring. The cen
sus comes and goes, like the succession
of summer and winter; now all Is life and
activity, now silence and inaction. The
clerks receive their .notice of dismissal,
then: Â¦ Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦.-â¢.- '-.'.â¢â¢'. - 1 ":- ,.-'-.'Â¦' ' -l'~ "Â¦Â¦ "' : '-.

â¢The director goes with the rest. All are
goneâ officers, clerks, quarters, files, furni
ture, stationery, everything; Such records
as it is deemed prudent .to preserve, aro
stowed anywhere in charge vot^a.,-,ainple
clerk awaiting the new decade. Â¦ Since ipo
part of them have been destroyed by fire
and . have mingled with the: .elements,
never to be' reproduced or replaced. -. :' â¢ : Â¦
When the hour for preparation for the
next census arrives and a, new Congress,
more or less unfamiliar with the subject,
has to grapple with the question of pre^
llmlnary legislation; no official head of the
bufeaif stands ready to assist the.commlt
tees with advice suggested by actual ex
perience. For this and for other reasons
action is so delayed that insufficient time
for preparation on the part of the director
and his assistants is allowed. There Â¦ is.
morepverV no- opportunity 'for .amending
the census act in advance in those partic
ulars in which it is discovered to be'de
fective. , The President appoints a new di
rector, who is confirmed, proceeds to the
national capital and there finds^nothtng
except a collection of partial records on
file he knows not where, and which con
tain he knows not what. - .'-: . i .' â¢:â¢Â¦",'Â¦â¢Â¦
Problem of Appointments. .
Some allusion to the difficulties which
confront the director at this initial stage
of his official career- cannot, well be
avoided, since it is here sought to give a
true account of. the inner working of the
Gensms Office. Let the reader put himself
in the director's place. .His first duty will
be to secure some temporary quarters,
none having been provided for him. The
hungry horde of applicants for appoint
ment by . which he ia besieged will not
wait, however,: until he has a place in
which to transact business. They -waylay
him at his, hotel, follow him to his lodg
ings and rob him of his privacy even at
his meals. Their friends accompany them
or come in their stead, and the mails are
burdened with letters from those who
cannot make ah attack In person, all of
which must be courteously acknowledged,
with promise of "due consideration" at
the proper time. -. t .'Â¦â¢.â¢ ... '
A word here on the subject of appoint
ments. Census taking is hot a private en
terprise conducted for profit. Public opin
ion and public sentiment demand that in
the distribution of places there shall.be
at least an approach to geographical
equity; that thA District of Columbia and
the States nearest to the national capital
shall not be given the lion's share, while
California, Texas, Florida and Maine are
overlooked arid get nothing.. .Stalwart
partisans insist that all appointees should
rightfully belong to the political party in
power, while the minority- in Congress
strenuously ' claims . consideration, and is
in position, if this claim ia ignored, to.
hamper the. work of the office by opposing
necessary, legislation on Its behalf: When
the present census act was under discus
sion the proposal to put the employes in
the civil service was rejected, but the Di
rector was authorized to apply an educa
tional test of his own devising at his dis
cretion. . It -needs' no argument to show
that he cannot -select the force without
frleniily suggestions from the "outside.
Naturally he. expects to receive it from
the representatives of the people In the
House and Senate and .from other In
fluential citizens of the several States and
Territories temporarily residing In Wash
ington'. The plan adopted in the present
census' was to make. a list of those, to be
consulted and to assign to each person
upon this list a. certain number of ap
pointments to be recommended by him.
Candidates with such recommendation
wore- given' a practical examination in
penmanship, orthography, simple artth
.metic, knowledge of the English language
and general' information as severe as that
made by the Civil Service Commission for
similar positions, if .not more so, and un-.
less they secured an average rating of 75
were rejected. . By this method the Con
gressional desire for a voice in appoint
ments was gratified, all portions of the
country were afforded an e.quitable share
in them and -the office was protected
against the Intrusion of incompetent
clerks, so far as any literary and
scholastic examination can determine in
advance of actual trial the capacity of an
applicant for governmental employment.
No system of selection can give a prefeet
ly satisfactory result, but probably the
â¢satisfaction obtained by the application of
this method was as great as that which
woulr* have followed the adoption of any
other and more general. The cost for
examination was not half what it would
have been had all of them been permitted
to take it. The number of applications,
on file in round numbers Is 16,000. ' The
number examined was probably 7000 or 8000
and the number who passed was between
3000 and 4000. .
Housing the Census Bureau,
The next important step to be taken was
to secure a permanent home for the force
The present act limits the authority of the
director to the renting of quarters. Un
fortunately there Is In Washington no
building of sufficient size which is avail
able for this purpose. There never. will
Jte unless Congress shall provide it. - But
the act sets aside no portion of the Gov
ernment reservation for the use of the
offloe. Neither does It admit of the erec
tion, of a building at the expense of -the
appropriation made for preliminary, ex
penses. It-would nave been- an economy
had it done so. The evils consequent upon

Policemen Are Searching for Ho Wing, Who, It Is
Believed, Is the Murderer.
Â¦\ . - Â¦ -
YUT NGUN. one of the prettiest
slave girls In the Chinese quar
ter, was murdered early yester
day morning in a brothel at 30
Bartlett alley. The police are
searching for Ho Wing, who was until
recently employed as a cook at San Jose.
The evidence at hand points to him as
the murderer. It Is believed Ho Wing
has left the city. The detectives are In
hopes of locating him In the interior of
the State.
Revenge Said to Be Motive.
The body of the woman was not dis
covered until shortly before noon yester
dav, and the murderer had many hours'
time in which to perfect his plane for es
cape. A deslr* to revenue a fancied in
sult is the motive assigned for the crime.
After the murder the room was ran
sacked and jewelry and money amounting
to several hundred dollars were stolen.
The friends of the dead woman say she
was married and that her- husband went
to China about six months ago. After his.
departure she began leading a disso
lute life. Soon she had many ad
mirers. About six weeks ago she
moved Into the house where she
wus murdered. Among those who visited
her frequently was Ho Wing. They were
very friendly until a few days ago, when
thev quarreled. Wins claiming she had
spoken slightingly of him. The other in
mates of the Mouse Interfered, and Ho
Wing was ordered out of the place. He
was told to keep away, as he would not
be tolerated If he waa going to attract
police attention by creating a disturb
ance. Ho Wing returned to the house
Thursday night and â¢ asked to see Yut
Ngun. She at first declined -to meet him,
but finally relented. She said, she would
afford him an opportunity to explain his
conduct of a few nights before. Together
they went to her room, -which was located
<m the second floor, in the roar portion
of the house. That was the last time the
woman was seen alive. The Chinese say
Wing and Tut Ngun were heard talking
as late as 3 o'clock yesterday morning, so
the murder must have occurred after that
time. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ Â¦ - â¢ .
Discovery of the Body.
Yew Chuey. the proprietor of the house,
went to "the woman'? room shortly before
noon yesterday and knocked on the door.
Not receiving ah answer he became,
alarmed and forcibly opened the door. A
horrifying sipht .met his eaze. Vet Ngun !
was lying dead on the bed, with her head
and face cut in a dozen or more places by
blows from .a hatchet. The murderer,
after completing- his bloody work, placed
the hatchet in the left hand of his victim.
Any one of the wounds would have been
sumcten't to cause death. The position of
the body showed that the woman had
been slain while sleeping. The curtains,
and wal!s around the bed were bespat
tered with blood. Â¦â¢. ' ..--..â¢
The police were notified at once and De
tectives Wren and Dinan were sent to the
scene of the murder. In making an ex
amination of the room they found that a
trunk belonging to the murdered woman
had been opened and rifled. The Chinese
say that none of them entered thÂ« room
before- the arrival of the detectives, and
that the money and jewelry known to
have been In the trunk were stolen by the
murderer. They claim that the jewelry
was worth fully $150 and that there mUst
; have teen between J.VK) and $500 in coin in
the trunk. After killing the woman and
rifling- the trunk T.he murderer . passed out
and locked the bedroom door. Whether
he went through the house and out Into
Bartlett alley or made his escape through
a blind. alley running bacTv of the house
ami leading to Pacific street is a matter of
conjecture. 'â¢â¢ . â¢ '- . .:-. -. â¢ â¢
; Description of the Scene.
Adjoining the apartment : where the
woman was murdered is a small room,
used for storing 1 old furniture. This room
is never locked. A door In it leads to a
balcony running the full length of the
hou?eand connected by a stairway with
the blind alley. As the door leading to
the bali-ony was found open, it Is pre
sumed that the murderer went through
the alley.
Yew Chuey,. the proprietor of the place,
and Suey Choy, his wife, have been locked
up in the CUy Prison pending: a further
investigation. While they are not sus
pected of having any knowledge of the
BOARD OF TRADE
ANSWERS WELLS
Takes Exceptions to Stric
turts Regardiug City's
Â¦ Indabtedness.
The Board of Trade takes exceptions to
the strictures Of Auditor Walls regarding
that body's connection with the collection
of the city's Indebtedness which will
shortly be paid by virtue of the constitu
tional amendment recently adopted by the
people. H. L.. Smith, secretary â¢ of the
Board of Trade, has addressed an open
letter stating the position of the board on
the matter and also explaining how it
came to be connected with the collection
of old claims against the city. .. :
A few days ago Mr/ Wells received a
circular signed by F. W, Eaton as sur
viving member of a committee of the as
sociation of merchant creditor* -which
was organized in 1893 for the purpose of
prosecuting the collection of claims for
which the city had defaulted in payment.
The circular called on creditors to com
bine In the collection of claims and an
agreement was attached calling on them
to pay at least 25 per cent of all moneys
collected to Secretary Smith as recom
penne for his labors. Wells said that he
could not see how the Board 'of Trade had
anything to do. with the affair, and that
he would resent the interference of third
parties In settling the claims; To place
Itself right on the subject the board pre
pwred . the open letter, 'which la oa. fol
lows: ' Â¦ â¢ â¢Â¦ .
In March. 1S93, owing to the municipal ad
ministration refusing; to pay thevclty'a clajms,
a meeting of certain: creditors of :th* city and
county of San ' Francisco, waa called at tha
rooms of the Board of .Trade. At said meeting
it wta decided .to employ counsel and com
mence suit. Prom this time on several meet
ings were held of all creditors that could be
re-ached, durine which time a committee waa
appointed by the creditors to take charge of
the matter, said committee 'to have full -power
to act In- any and all directions, to employ coun
eel, procure the paMage of such ponstltutlonal
amrndmente as would enable the city and coun
ty of San Francisco to pay Its Indebtedness
and to Incur such conts a.nd Â¦ expenses at It
de*-med ; proper, not to exceed 60 per cent- of
creditor*' claims, contingent 'upon the recovery
of wild claims. Upon this authority 'the com
mittee employed attorneys, who drew up a con
ottutlpnal amendment, which -was Introduced in
the session of the Les*Â»Â»Â»Uire of 1*97 .by Benator
Dickinson. The members of the committee de
voted weeks of tfieir . personal service at the
legislature to assist In the passage of thÂ«
amendment and 'were successful. When sub
mitted to tS'e people for their approval - tha
amendment failed to receive a majority vote.
At the last eeeeion of the Legislature the com
mittee called upop Mayor Phelnn and t>tated
tholr intention of submitting another constitu
tional amendment and agreed to have It drawn,
in accordance with 'his views. The amendment
was *o drawn and- again presented for passage.
At this tlmÂ« the Indebtedness due the school
teachers was belnr agitated' and our commit*
tee jvaÂ» Â¦ requested to allow the amendments to
include -the teachers' salaries. â¢ After another
conference with the Mayor, and after obtaining
his approval. It was *o altered, passed by the
Legislature and carried at the last election by
a majority, vote of the people. . Â¦'
Thus it is shown what interest the Board of
Trade has In the collection of the city's indebt
ednua. Â¦ But for the board and Hb committee
no individual creditor of the city and county. of
8an Franclfco would receive one nickel. After
eight yean of active service and a hard strug
gle we have given the Board of Supervisors . a
legal right to pay the city's honest debts. It
has always been claimed by the officials that
they would like to pay. this Indebtedness and
would pay It If they had a legal right to do so.
. The expenses incurred in obtaining this legal
right ere still unpaid. As - stated . before
no creditor of the city and ceunty of San-Fran
cisco would receive one cent If It were not for
the action or this board, and we think it but
right and reasonable to ask the creditors "ir

MENTO, March 1.â ThÂ«re has bÂ«Â»en a
hitch in the ji&ssaB" of the Agricultural
1'ark bill because it has not been drawn
according to agreement. When the Orig
inal bill providing for the appropriation of
J100.000 to pay the debts of the Agricult
ural Society and to Improve the property
was in danger, of being killed it was
agreed between the directors of the so
ciety and the Finarce Committee of â¢ the
Senate that a sum sufficient to pay the
debts of the society would be appropri
ated if the property were. deeded to the
Â£tate; but- it was found- when the bill
came up-that it provided a string to the
deed, binding the State to use the prop
erty .for the purpoM of an agricultural
park. -Leavitt Fubmitted an amendment
striking out the condition' and leaving the
provision requiring an .absolute deed. .
Leavitt said the State could not do busi
ness on a conditional basis. Either the
deed should be unconditional and absolute
or the appropriation should be killed.
Devlin .-;.itke for the bill as It was. saying
that it was only fair that" the' society
Fhould be assured that the property
fchould be cfintinuedlnthe uses to which
it had .been put. â¢ Me eaid there was a
moral obligation to po continue It.
Smith of Kern could not Â»eÂ« It that wav.
He said if the State paid the debt It should
have the property, particularly as it was
very probable that the State owned the
property anywajf. . .
The dleeusFion waÂ£ 6topped by "the pas

The Trust Problem.
To a thoughtful mind, the trust problem Is
onÂ« of serious import. .It must be | firmly
grappled with, for: It creeps upon society be
fore you are aware of its existence. In this re
rpect much resembling the various, disorders
which attack the , stomach, such as constipa
tion, - Indigestion.", dyspepsia. - and biliousness'
Hostetter's -Ftomach Bitters will cure all such
ailments, and prevent la (rrlppe, malarial fever
and ague. Be sure to give It a trial.

y : .' J r ? / Whit^ver : you drink outside, let your r
home beer be Schlitz. Thatjs par-e-bcer. ;.
.'â¢"Â¦";' Â¦ * ',^ â¢ No batilli. in it^---- nothing to make you " -
bilious. ' ' . y
Beer is a saccharine product* and germs
multiply rapidly in it The slightest^ taint
of impurity quickly ruins its healthfulness. >-
We go to the utmost extremes to prevent
v that. Cleanliness is a science where^Schlitz
b v eer is brewed. \
We even cool the beer in plate glass
rooms, in nothing but. filtered air.
, /Then we filter , the beer. ' Th^n we
sterilize every bottle.
And Schlitz beer is aged. The. beer: that Â«
makes you bilious is green beer.
When you order beer for your home^
get the healthfulness without the harm.
Get a pure beer - get an old beer- get Schlitz.

on a special Chicago and Alton train.
Within an hour after Arrival Shenkle had
pleaded guilty, had been given "an inde

The prisoner with apparent unconcern
puffed a cigarette as" the column, began
the "march down the street Meadlng; from
the station to the : courthouse, about
three-quarters- of a' mile distant. THe
march .was without incident. Shenklo
was" escorted Into th a .courtroom by the'
troops under command of Adjutant Gen
eral Reece", which then withdrew and
surrounded the building. â¢ Only court at
taches, a squad of miUtia and- the news
paper correspondents were allowed in- the
courtroom, and the proceedings bore all
the aspects of -a military trial.
The warrant- charging Shenkle with' as
sault on little Grace tMUon was read and
the. prisoner asked what plea he would
make. â¢ : â¢ . - â¢
plead guilty," said Shenkle.
"The" judgment on your plea Is that you
wlll be confined tn the penitentiary- at
Chester, there" to remain until you are
discharged in the due process of the law,"
said Judge Thompson. .
The court arose and- without a wo.rd tho
condemned prisoner extended his- hands*
for the shackles. A moment 'later the
military' formed a -guard "around the
Sheriff- and his prisoner and- .marched
down the street for the station. Within

Shenkle made a full confession of his

room has been .reached and they are only
fifteen' feet .from a' point in the level
where tlve flre occurred and a* the work

It has been decided by those well experi

have to elapse before another -effort would
be made to get beyond the flre.
So. as to allow the pure air to advance
and also give the part of the mine which
was on fire more time to cool off, they
have sealed the sixth level at Xo. 45^room.
It la understood from -miners who have
been to No. 45 room that the heat be

Jacob Johansen Is Arrested for Inflicting Unusual
Punishment on His Nine=Year=Old Son.
JACOB JOHANSEN, a porter em
ployed by the H. S. Crocker Com
pany and living at 3901 Folsom
â¢ street, was arrested yesterday on
a warrant charging him with cruel
ty to children. His offense, which, it is
alleged, was committed about ten days
ago, consisted in burning the face and
hands of his eldest son, a bright lad of
nine years, with a red-hot iron towel rack
taken from the family cookstove. Both
hands and both sides of the child's face
give mute evidence of the terrible punish
ment Inflicted.
According to the admissions of the pa
rents, this is not the first time that fire
has been applied to the boy's person. The
mother admits that for the correction of
a youthful indiscretion she used the flame
of a candle and the corrective blaze was
so efficacious that in the discharge of her
duties as mother she has never had to re
cur to the came mode of punishment.
Arthur's offense on that occasion con

Kerrigan set aside the decree of divorce
and gave Mrs. Hayden the right to an
swer the complaint and make her de
fense. The additional facts given yester
day by Cole Convinced the court that Mrs.
Hayden's petition for alimony should be
granted, and Hayden was ordered to pay
the sum of $50 a month. for her mainte

iare very <^r>inTnon. but th*> sufferer usually
thinks It is eomething else than Catarrh
Â»r.d is tr^atÂ«^l for the wrong disease.
"The be^t and most successful treatment
for any form of catarrh Is now admitted
to r<<Â» by Internal remedies through the
ftomach. and the safest and probably tho
most efficient is in the tablet form, sold
by drusjrifts as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
: "I have seen many remarkable cures of
catarrh resulting from regular daily use
of these tablets, which seem to act on
jhp blood and liver, driving- the catarrhal
poison out of the eystem through the nat-
ural channels.
"I once had occasion to analyze these
tebletp and found them to contain no co-
caine nor opiates, but simply a combina-
tion of harmless antiseptics like Kucalyp-
lal. Ouaiacol. blood root. etc. :
"At any rate. I have known of severe ca-
tarrhal headaches which were cured by
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, and catarrhal
deafness, hay fever, asthma, and catarrh
of the throat and stomach speedily show
prf-at benefit after a few days' use of
the remedy, and when It Is remembered
now much more convenient a tablet Is
than* inhalers, douches, salves and pow-
ders It Is not surprising that this < new
preparation should bo rapidly supplant a.11
other remedies for catarrh." :

to have been the plan of nature that woman should suffer so severely. L,y<liÂ»

much discomfort and robs menstruation of its terrors.

NEW YORK, March 1.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will pay: The predom
inating Influence In the speculative world this
week was the proponed combination of - the
Carnegie Company and the other prominent
steel manufacturing concerns. When tho New
York Stock Exchange adjourned on Thursday
of last week for a throe days' holiday it was
fully expected that the resumption of business
on Monday would be attended by' some definite
announcement about the matter. This hope
was disappointed as the managers of the deal
made public the terms . on which holders of
the common and preferred stocks of the half
dozen companies which are to come into the
new combination are to be Invited to exchange
their holdings for the new shares. The- pre
mlnary incorporation of the prospective'' bil
lion dollar trust under the title of the United
State* Steel Corporation was also effected and
various other details were made known about
the financial arrangements Connected with the
execution of the plan. This served to divert
speculative activity and attention to the in
dustrials end heavy trading ensued In the
stocks of the companies Included In the deal
as well as in the securities of the new com
bination, the latter, uf course, being dealt in
on the so-called "curb" market In the form
of contracts for the delivery of the stock when
and as issued. The activity in the latter stocks
there was considerable, the prices ranging all
the way from 33 to 40 for the common and
from 78 to 8S for the preferred. There was
also heavy dealings both in and out of the
exchange In the constituent stocks, a good deal
of which seemed to be :arbUrat!ng. trades or
purchases and sales, or vice versa, of United
States steel stocks and those of one of the
other companies, based on the apparent mar
gins between the market prices for the old
and the new stocks and the figures at which
the former securities are to be exchanged for
the latter. There was also not a lKtle of what
the street thought to Is Inside selling in some
of the steel stocks and it would seem that the
public failed to develop any great disposition
to trade in that group. Finally prices for the
various stocks -directly. involved in the deal
were readjusted In some - proportion to their
respective positions unUer the terms of the
consolidation and the volume of transactions
In them fell to moderate proportions.

Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Jobbing trade in groceries, hardware and iron
specialties has further gained in volume In the
East since our last report and retail business
has been good, except for a slow movement of
some descriptions of dry goods, notably cloth-
Ing, of which dealers fear they must carry
over unusually. large Btocks. In the West and
Southwest, however,' the season has been sat
isfactory. The greatest Industrial combination
ever arranged,- tha.t providing for. the union of
the leading steel Interests, has not directly
affected business as yet and may. not do so,
otherwise than by removing some of the un
necessary competition from the Industry.
Ncmlnal quotations of iron and steel are
misleading. According to published lists it
appears that while pig iron has steadily ad
vanced for many weeks little change has oc
curred In finished products. This discrepancy
Is due to the "figures IKed by the various pools
and associations, but at which it Is impossible
to secure prompt deliveries. Actual business
is done at extensive ad'/nnces over these prices,
billets selling at $21 at Pittsburg, or more than
a dollar above the nominal rate, while plates,
bars an! structural shapes are only available
when special terms are offered. Even on dis
tant deliveries mills arÂ«r asking higher figures
and every line of steel production at Plttsburg
has already covered full contracts for the. next
two months, while there Is a. general feeling
th_at mrterlal advances will occur befpre May
1. Bessemer pig iron sold this week at $15 23
and gray forge at $19â prices that have not
been equaled since early In August. The coke
production Is enormo.usj.nd Connellsville prices
at last show a definite advance.
Further Increase appears in sales of wool at
the three chief Eastern markets, 8.SS0.5C0
pounds changing handi for the week, against
8.52S.500 in the previous veek. A year ago total
transactions â¢ were less than half the present
week's oyeratlons. There Is still no reason to
believe that the heavy ; buying results from bet
ter conditions at the mills, as orders for goods
do not appreciably ' expand, except In a few
special lines. If manufacturers were bidding
for raw material largely the decline in prices
would be checked, but the average oh March
1 was the lowest since June, W99.
Shipments of boots -and shoes from Boston
were 87.026 cases, against 84.675 in the week
preceding and 1C0.S56 a year ago. Most vlsltlnK
buyers have concluded sampling and returned
home. Shops have ample work for some time
to come and prices are. well malntainfd. Large
stocks of hides depress prices at Chicago, tak
ing the average to the lowest point since last
October. â¢ â¢
Curtailment cf production by Southern yarn
mills has become general and at Fall River
there-is much discussion of the advisability of
reducing output or lowering wages. Los3 In
domestic consumption of raw cotton seems As
sured and foreign buying is far from satis
factory. The position of this staple Is not
made flrtw-r' by news that sales of fertilizers
surpass all 1 records in many Southern States.
Grain markets are firmly maintained. Do
mestic crop conditions are encouraging and the
best explanation of strength is found in At
lantic exports during February of wheat, flour
Included, amounting to 10,343,204" bushels,
against 7,671,552 last year, and 14,730,262
bushels of corn against 12,724,645 In 1900. *
I Commercial failures in February were 1024
in number and J11.2S7.211 In amount, compared
with 1242 in January with liabilities of $11,
220,811.
It Is worthy of. note that nearly a third <jf
the liabilities In manufacturing failures were,
due to a single bankruptcy of a railway con
tractor, while not one of the 757 trading de
faulters owed as much as $100,000. Â¦

It is reported that the fire at the Coimw prop

changing their plants from coal to oil. after
viewing the situation from every side. They
find It reduces the fuel account, their stock*
are replenished weekly, hence less money is
lrvested, less space is required and less labor
requisite. Now all doubts are dispelled as to
whether the supply will be continuous, as con
tracts are solicited for deliveries extending.

fully 20 per cent In favor of fuel oil. Very'
few names are being added to the coal loadlne

The only features were some further buying
of Eries and a spurt in Chesapeake and Ohio
issues. The interest In Erie, as explained yes
terday, was due to a belief that dividends are
coming on all issues. The upstart.- of Chesa

Money rates began to relax, on the turn of

In this w<?ek a year ago. 170 In 1S99, 232 In 1S9S
and 2C2 in 1S97.
From July 1 to date this season wheat ex
ports -are 134,447.989 bushels, against 134^380,593
bushels last season and 163,715,874 bushels in
1SPS-99.
Including flour, shipments for the

302 bushels last week. 3.8C-3.3S7 bushels In the
corresponding week of -1900, 5.S15.5S5 bushels In
1S99 and 3,232;000 bushels in ISO?.
The strength of Iron and steel this week re
calls the boom of 1899.. It is probable, too. that
the broad and strong consumptive demand; and
not. the operation of. pools or cliques, Is re
sponsible for the. steady advances. Practically
all markets report iron and steel higher, bu,.
special activity is noted at Pittsburg, Birming
ham and Chicago. St. Louis alone reports foun
dry iron consumers indifferent. At Pittsoarg
Bessemer pig Is 75c higher and at Chicago fcoutn
ern pig shows a similar gain. Steel billets now
tell $3 over the pool price for prompt delivery.
Stocks of pig and billets are reported small.
Ore prices have not yet 'been fixed, and the Â»ra
provement' in Iron may result In higher prices
than earlier expected. In finished products the
feature is the advance of $4 per ton In steel
sheets at Putsburg and Chicago. Ail mills arc
reported well supplied with orders. Despite the
fact that export trade In crude materials par
ticularly Is small with industrially well ad
vanced countries, a good movement to other
countries is noted. A sample erf this Is th*
order for 40,000 tons of 66-pound rails â¢ reported
from Ecuador and orders for railway materials
from Australia and* Africa. .- ' -
Shoe traders are active at all markets ana
manufacturers arc busy. The rush of Western
buying is on the wane at Boston, but New
England manufacturers are assured of a busy
time from now, till October. Leather Is advan
cing. No. 1 hemlock and union sole are lc a
pound higher than actual talcs a week bko.
The cereals" are without notable change, wheat
and corn being fractionally lower In a cull,
scalping market. Corn is rather in better ex
port demand.- but rumors of a '-deal" at Cni
cago restrict operations somewhat. Cuban sugar
crop prospects are responsible for the slight
weakness shown in raw sugar this week, which
latter, however, has not affected refined. Lum
ber. Is strong in price, pending the resumption
of genera! building operations. Western advices
are especially bullish. Chicago has done the
heaviest business ever recorded in yellow pine
and white pine. Stocks have been broken badly
by the ' active demand which has advanced
prices $l@2E0 above the list. Hard woods are
rather slower to respond, however, and are still
unsteady, not to say weak. Copper Is less act
ive for export, but holds firm, while tin is again
Sower on weaker foreign advices.

The letter says: .- .
All of the men reported to your commission
as dtpchar^ed are In: the second class as to
efficiency. This board. In confprmity. to section
10, 'article- 'XIII of the charter, assigns as the
reason for discharge - <A these men the fact
that they did not conform to the standard of
efficiency in their respective lines which this
city, is entitled to require. Â¦ The course, thus
pursued, in retaining Â¦ the' most efficient men
and discharging -less efflclent nvn la in con

feat a chief end of all civil service legislation,

vice. ' â¢ ' . ' .: . ; ..:-..- --. ' .
The. Crvll Service 'Board holds that this
is not sufficient reason. for the discharge
of the- men. It will Insist on the Board
of Works filing specific charges of Inef
ficiency- against the. discharged men. who
will be- afforded. a public trial to disprove
the charges. If the. charges are not sus

For Congress to. adjourn without mak

have meant a setback for this side of the

consummation of the work that Congress

When the House bill failed to give Oak
land any appropriation there was. some
misgiving upon this side of the bay. ard
a fear that the work might be delayed
But Congressman Muicalf. gave' the mat

that Oakland should hav'e recognition in

represented C. "W. Clark, a Sacramento

watered stock range, adjacent to the San
Francisco market. H!s. offers were of no
liberal a figure that Crosier had no diffi

sections upon which it is known there
is water. .
Most of the land which has been bond

twelve to twenty miles toward the moun

owners and ranchers of \ht> valley believe
