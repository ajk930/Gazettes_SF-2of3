along the effort of those right minded peo
ple who are endeavoring to obtain an
American system of government for the
American territory of Hawaii. As thiugs
are now in the Islands very little of the
American philosophy of government is
.manifested. All the officials from the
Governor to the lowest constable are ap
pointee?, and every man of them is using
his official position, not for the public

Emmeluth said:
Â¦There were- few other developments of
importance during the day. Locally the
strike seems to drag and Interest to flag.
There was a great labor demonstration
at Wheeling to-day and President Shaffer
made a stirring appeal to his followers to
work on. In an Interview before he spoke
he said that if the Western lodges did not

strikers succeeded in finally forcing the

probably the largest Individual plant in
the United States Steel Corporation, to
cJose down. Oh the other hand the
steel corporation reopened the big Painier
mill In this city and also resumed opera
tions with non-union men at the Crescent
plant of the American Tin Plate Com
pany at Cleveland. Two mills were run
ning at the Painter plant, although one
of them broke down during the day and
according to the statement of the officials
half the mills in the Crescent plant were
moving. The forces at both the plants
named are to be increased and the man
agers assert that they will soon have
them working in full. They make the
fifth and sixth plants which the steel cor

PTTTSBURG, Pa.. Aug. 14.-There
were victories on both sides of the
great steel strike to-day,- but they
furnish no direct line on the ulti-
The spread of the strike at McKeesport
and Wheeling has brought the number
of men who answered the final strike or
der to something over 20,000, and increased
the total number of .men rendered Idle by
the three orders to about 65,000. . Many of Â¦
the men- drawn 'into the movement, will
ingly or. unwillingly, continue to accept
other -employment, and the exact number
now idle is a guess./ The strikers are fully
in control at McKeesport, Wheeling, New
castle, Bellalre and Mingo Junction/and
show some strength here. The manufac
turers hold South Chicago, Bay View,
Joliet, Youngstown, Columbus, the Kis

named property some doubt is expressed
as to the Lower -Union mill In Pittsburg.
Some men left their places there, and the
strikers boast that, they will close it. - It
Spread of the Strike.
Large numbers of the strikers have gone
away, either for recreation or to work,
and there has been scarcely any excite
ment, much less disorder.
McKeesport and Wheeling are stirred
up periodically, but there has been no
violence at either place. Rumor again
to-day settled the strike and lent a hand
to restart the stilled mills of commerce.
It was related that President Shaffer had
acknowledged that he could not win, that
the steel corporation feared that its rivals
would profit by an extended strike and
that they were going to settle. No shadow
of confirmation of the story was possible.
The general strike situation Is ' thus
briefly summarized: v
" Late this afternoon Plummer Jones of
Warren, Ohio, an employe of the tunnel
contractors . and . one of .a party of res
cuers, who descended into the shaft to
look for the missing men, was overcome
by gas and expired within a'few minutes.
His body lies in the tunnel seventy-five
feet' from, the bottom of the .shaft and is
covered with water.
Mayor Tom Johnson expressed great in
dignation to-day when he learned that no
boat or life-preservers were provided as
a safety measure by the contractors at
the crib, jj He declared that the case would
receive 'the closest investigation and those
found guilty of criminal negligence in the
matter would be prosecuted to the full ex
tent of the law. ,i y .'Â¦

The passengers obeyed, lining up with
alacrity. Hardly had the stage stopped

hands," was the command Al Palmer,
driver of the first outgoing Calistoga and
Clear Lake stage met with as he turned
his four horses around a sharp curve go
ing up the Mount St. Helena road early
this afternoon. Standing In the middle of
the road, with a Winchester rifle aimed
directly at the driver's head, was a me
dlum-sized man with a blue-colored hand
kerchief covering the lower part of his
face. Driver Palmer slapped on the brake
and brought the stage to a stand.
"Pile out there, and be lively," was the
next command.
CALISTOGA, Aug. 14.â Two Calistoga
and Clear L*ke stages, which left here
at 11:45 o'clock this morning, were held
up and robbed five miles out from town
by a lone highwayman. The robber ob
tained approximately $400 in cash and sev
eral watches from the passengers, who
numbered sixteen, several of them being
women. It is supposed he had a com
panion concealed In ambush. His work
was performed deliberately and thorough
ly. No clew had been found up to a late
hour to-night. Sheriff Dunlap and a posse
are on the robber's trail with bloodhounds.

After leaving the meeting Tighe ex
pressed* himself as greatly disappointed
at the action taken this evening, and said
that to-morrow he will go to the Bay
View mills at Milwaukee and also to those
at Joliet. He will repeat the programme
of to-night at those cities, explain the
cause of the strike, and if the men should
decline to reconsider their action in re
fusing to join the ranks of the strikers
he will declare the charters of all their
lodges forfeited and rule the men out of
the association.
Tighe announced the charters of both
lodges revoked and the meeting dissolved.
Tighe made a long address to the men,
giving -them the story of the strike from
the standpoint of the Amalgamated As
sociation, and asking them to help the
men in the East by quitting the mills in
South Chicago. Several speeches were
made by the local members of the asso
ciation in reply to Tighe, the general
trend being that the men considered them,
selves bound by contracts with their em
ployers, and that they did not think that
it was their duty to turn their backs on
these contracts at the bidding of the of
ficers of the association. At 11 o'clock
a vote was taken the question of, re
consideration, and by an overwhelming
majority the men refused to reopen the
question.
CHICAGO, Aug. 14.â There will be no
Etrike of the employes at the steel mills
in South Chicago. This point was settled
to-night, when the men refused to re
consider the action taken Saturday night,
at which time they directed to stand by
their contracts with the mills and re
fused to join the strikers. After they had
declined to reconsider to-night, Assist
ant Secretary M. F. Tighe of the Amalga
mated Association, who came to Chicago
with the intention of securing a revoca
tion of the action of Saturday night, if
possible, declared that he revoked the
charters . of both lodges of the Amalga
mated Association in the South Chicago
mills and declared the men outside of the
organization.. The men greeted his an
nouncement with laughter and cheers.
Tighe arrived in the city yesterday and
spent to-day arranging for a second
meeting of the two lodges of the Amal
gamated Association to be held this even
ing. The men gathered at the appointed
hour, but there were so few of them in
the hall that the end of the matter was
a foregone conclusion. By far the greater
number of members of the two lodges had
gone to work instead of coming to the
meeting, and only a handful was pres
ent.

Los Angeles Buys Land.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14.â The City
Council in extra session to-day appropri
ated $33,250 for the purchase of 307 acres
of land in Tejunga Pass, at the headwat
ers of Los Angeles River. Negotiations
have been quietly in progress for the past
month through Attorneys Lee and Scott.
The utmost secrecy was maintained, for
fear of injunction proceedings, and to
day the deal was consummated as soon
as the purchase money was available, so
that the city's title to the land is now be- '
yond question. The acquisition of this)
prooerty is considered a master stroke, as
the" land Is so situated that practically
the entire ibutflow, surface and subterra
nean, of Los Angeles River can be divert
ed and in the event of the final failure of Â¦

pany's plant can be Immensely reduced

the commission and appropriating $5000 for
its expenses was passed on the 1st day of
May. the last day of the session of the
Hawaiian Congress, according to our com
putation, though .the session ended on
April 30. according to Governor Dole. It
was only by using the joint agreement
concerning the hold-over Senatorships as
a club that we had the tax commission
bill passed at all, and as soon as it was
passed it was put in the hands of the At
torney General that its legality might be
tested and that it might be defeated if
possible.
"The present system of taxation is based
on real estate and improved property and
every sugar plantation is assessed on its
actual cash value. There is al3o an in
come tax of 2 per cent on all Incomes of
over $1000. This system needs much re
modeling and many amendments and it
is for the purpose^ of Inaugurating these
reforms that the commlssidn has been
created.
"We are a territory of the United States
and wa want a regular American terri
torial form of government. We don't want
all the patronage that comes with official
position and the authority to distribute
several millions of dollars to be controlled
by a few people who use it to further their
own ends. We want a regular territorial
county government, which will Induce
white people to come and settle among
us with the knowledge that they will be
protected In their liberties and their
rights. While I am East I will do all I
possibly can to obtain this very much de
sired condition of affairs for the Hawaiian
Islands, in whose prosperity I am most
deeply interested."
From other sources.it was learned that
the dispute over the date ending the sixty
day session of the Hawaiian Legislature
arose over the refusal of Governor Dole
to consider Washington's birthday a legal
holiday. Dole contended It was not a hol
iday inasmuch as It had never been so
created by " Congress. The Home Rule
party argued thai it was a holiday
whether Congress had so declared it to
be or not. Those opposed to Dole con
tended that the unanimous will of the
American people had made it a holiday,
second in importance only to the Fourth
of July, and that whether or not Congress
had ever officially passed upon the ques
tion ; the day was always observed by that
body as well as by every other public
body that existed under the shadow of the
American flag.

them to' form !n line, the twelve of-the
first stage on the right side and^ the four
extra passengers on the left. "Â¦ Â¦ . â
"Come forward one at a time and shell
out," â¢ demanded the outlaw, laying aside
his rifle and producing an old-fashioned
horse pistol. With hands straight/up over
head the passengers, one by one in turn,
advanced and submitted to a thorough
searching. The robber was in no apparent
hurry, and coolly delved into his victims
pockets with one hand whenever he sus
pected they had not given over all the
money and valuables they carried.
â¢ After relieving the sixteen travelers of
all their wealth the robber requested
Palmer to throw off the Wells-Fargo ex
press box and the mail pouches. When
this was done he asked Driver Conner
for his express box. â¢ _,
"Ain't got any," replied the driver. "I m
only extra." *
"Well, you've been driving pretty regu
lar lately." said the robber, displaying a
knowledge of the running of the stages. _
The highwayman then allowed both
stages to proceed on their way up the
mountain. ' - '
The hold-up occurred near what is
known as Greenlee's place. It was an.
ideal spot for the purpose, the road wind
ing around a sharp projection of the
mountain and being on a steep up-grade.
Standing twenty-five feet ahead of the
front of the horses the robber occupied a
commanding position overlooking both
stages and not a move of the passengers
escaped his eye. Among the passengers
were five or six women. The robber
showed no discrimination of sex in his
work and collected toll from all alike. It
Is estimated that he obtained about $400
in cash, besides several articles of jew
elry- The express box, while quite heavy,
contained little money, it is said.
About this time every month money to
pay the employes of the Copper King
mines is sent up by stage. It is said here
that this money did not go up to-day, .ro
tret this gold was evidently, the motive
of the robbery. The stage was held up
just a year ago near this place. At that
time scarcely anything was_obtained.
Two boys who went up the road earlier
in the day report having seen two men
lurking around the scene of the hold-up.
Their description of the smaller man cor
responds very closely with that given by
Driver Palmer of the robber. It is sup
posed the. other man, who was described
as "tall and dark," lay In ambush while
his companion performed the work. This
would appear to account for the robber's
coolness and deliberation. â¢ . " ' "â¢
Dr Robert Powers of Calistoga was one
of the passengers. The names of the oth
ers are unknown, as they arrived here on
the morning train from San Francisco
and left almost immediately on the stage
for different resorts In Lake County.
The news of the hold-up was telephoned
to the local police authorities from Toll
Gate, one and a half miles beyond the
scene of the robbery. City Marshal Nash
left at once for the Greenlee place, and a
couple of hours later bloodhounds were
put on the trail. Sheriff Dunlap came up
from Napa late this afternoon and is hot
on the robber's trail with a large posse.
The highwayman is described by the
stage drivers as of dark complexion, five
feet eight inches in height, weighing
about 150 pounds " and wearing a dark
slouch hat, linen duster-^nd heavy work
"uo to a late hour to-night nothing had
been found except a half empty mail
pouch. This was found in a canyon
about a half mile down, the road. It. had
been rifled, but quite a bit of mail was
left: . , â¢ - --â¢

taken. My opinion Is that you will win. I
know that if the men who are out stay out

that when the mills are run again you will

Ix>t the Amalgamated Association so deport
Itself as to merit the approval we have already
received, and the encouragement and sup
port of church and state. What I say may
not be received with favor, but right is right.
This In a time when men's blood bolls with
indignation and hands are clenched in anger,
but tfcis Is no time for angry words or overt
deeds. If organized labor by observance of the
law can win a peaceful victory it will be the
grandest achievement known to the annals of
the wcrld. Hence I ask you to be careful.
Be law abiding, but be determined. The trust
cannot run the mills without you. There Is
not enough skilled labor left to make more
millions for these men who have centralized
capital. They have said. "Don't you dare to
I believe the time is coming In this defen
sive movement when. If necessary, your lead
ers will unite with the Amalgamated Asso
ciation to preserve all labor organisations from
the tyranny of the trusts. "When your lead
ers eay "come out," there will be such a
coming out as will make Wall street tremble
and cause those whom we have enriched to
tremble behind their piled up millions.
We don't want you to do that. Obey the
directions of your own leaders; see that your
laws are preserved Inviolate.
It baa been eaid that this Is not alone a
fight of the Amalgamated Association. That
Is true. Even to-day in Wheeling I wat; ap
proached by a committee of the Clothing
"Workers" Union and' given assurances that
they were with us and would extend - both
moral and financial aid. We realize also* that
the glass workers are with us, together with
the trainmen, and of course the coal miners
are with us. I want to say to the represen
tlveÂ« of the various trades that the Amalga
mated Association needs your moral and finan
cial assistance. We do not ask you to dis
obey your own leaders or violate the laws of
your organizations. I have received letters
from many subordinate lodges of other unions
eaylng:
"We will stop working, too, if you eay the
word."
At a meeting at the State Fair grounds
at Wheeling President Shaffer said in
part:
Will Make Wall Street Tremble.
Taking the 6trlke as a whole, we are mak
ing gains everywhere every day. Our member
chip is increasing at a rapid rate, and many
non-union mills where we have never before
been able to secure a foothold are now organ
ized or partially organized. Besides those al
ready so organized I know of. others that will
eoon take the same action, though of course I
cannot uc- into details on that score.
The manufacturers have made no effort I
to break the strike at McKeesoort. or
Wheeling with non-union men, and have
given no indication of their plans in those
districts. Both sides express their satis
faction with the progress 'of the strike.
Encouraged by success : - in keeping
Monessen going, and in opening their
plant at Cleveland, the officers of the
American Tinplate Company are planning
resumption with non-union men. at other
points. They will not say where their
next move will be made, but say that it
will be made quickly.
President Shaffer of the Amalgamated
Association started on his trip to Wheel
ing at 9:20 this morning and reached that
city shortly before noon. .He was re
ceived by Â«a. large crowd, which cheered
lustily when he appeared on the car steps.
The local unions paraded and escorted
him through the town. Before going to
the State Fair grounds, where the demon
stration was' held, he made the follow
ing statement as to the Western men who
refused to strike: .
If they do not come out they are non-union.
It is a mystery why they did not obey the
strike order from the etart. and the only ex
planation I can think of Is that given yesterday
at Pittsburr by Mr. Adams, the Illinois dep
uty, who told me the men had wanted an ex
tension of time In which to Etrike. Adams says
they had been led to believe that an extension
tvculd be . granted. We have Instructed Mr...
Tlghe to call out these men at once, and In the
Â«vent of their refusal their charters will be de
clared forfeited. I know these men, and I am
confident they will now agree to come out with
us in this fight. The skilled men are organized
and enousrh will strike to greatly cripple the
production of the Western mills. We may not
bring about a total suspension, each as is seen
here In the Wheeling district, which, by the
way, is the banner district of the entire steel
country, but we will do what we anticipated,
at the start, or I am greatly mistaken In Mr.
Tlghe's ability to present " the matter Â¦ In Its
proper light to the "Western men.

is running, however, and the managers
say it cannot be stopped. Desertions
from the ranks of the strikers are report
ed from Painter's mill here, and the Cres
cent plant in Cleveland, and the managers
say that it Is only a question of time be
fore there is a general break.
The French are not in a position to act
as freely as the Americans, as Prance Is
not called upon by treaty stipulations to
maintain communication on the isthmus
as is the United States. It Is believed here
that pending the arrival of the Machias
the presence of the Souchet will have a
good influence. '
In the meantime it is reported that the
French cruiser Souchet has arrived at
Colon. On account of the French Interest
in the Panama canal it Is thought to be
quite natural that the French should send
a warship there at this time. The au
thorities do not anticipate any friction be
tween the commander of the Souchet and
the American naval officers upon'the ar
rival of the latter at Colon. It is not ex
pected that the Souchet will land any
men or interfere In any way unless the
property of the Panama Canal -Company
t other French Interests should be actu
ly threatened.
There has been unexpected delay in
getting naval vessels down to the. isth
mus, but the Iowa is now on her way on
the Pacific side and the Machlas.;:is be

Officials of the State Department are
not disposed to believe that this has oc
curred, but they are entirely without
news of recent date from Bogota, and un
til something is received from there con
siderable* anxiety will be felt.
Senor Herran, Colombian Charge d'Af
faires, left for New York to-day and will
not return to Washington until late next
week. He is satisfied that there will be
no developments in ' the meantime re
quiring his presence In Washington.
The authorities are anxious to know
whether the departure of the Colombian
Minister from Caracas has been followed
by the withdrawal of the Venezuelan
Minister from Bogota, for if it has been
the inference would be that there had
been a complete rupture of diplomatic re
lations between the two countries.
been no change in the attitude of the ad
ministration toward the situation in Co
lombia and Venezuela as the result of the
return 1 to Washingtdh of Secretary Hay.
As. soon as the Secretary ' reached the
State Department to-day he had a con
ference with Assistant Secretary Adee,
who informed him as to all the details of
the situation as far as they are known In
Washington. Everything that has .been
done, incjtfdlng. the dispatch of war ves
sels to both sides of the isthmus to pro
tect American interests and to secure the
maintenance of communication by way of
the Panama Railroad, met with the Secre
tary's entire approval. Neither the State
Department nor Senor Pulldo, Venezuelan
Charge d'Affaires, has received any in
formation to-day.
Workmen began to-day to dismantle
Chartries mill at Carnegie. The machinery
will be taken to Leechburg, where the
new mill will be located. Work on the
Dewees-Wood property at McKeesport
has been suspended. The fact that the
annual encampment of the Second Brig
ade of the National Guard of Pennsylva
nia was postponed and that It Is to be
held at Somerset, near Pittsburg, Is re
garded as significant. The encampment
will begin this week and will last until
the latter part of next week. Within two
days the State will be in a position to
throw troops Into Pittsburg-. McKeesport
and Newcastle within a few hours. The
present situation, however, does not war

President Shaffer, that there was any dis
agreement in the board, or that there was
any wavering along their battle front.
All stories to the contrary they pro
nounced canards staVted by the enemy to
injure their cause. They said so many
Independent plants were being started
and those already in operation were tak
ing so many of the skilled men on strike
that the Steel Corporation alone would

VICTORY OH BOTH SIOES,
HONOLULU, Aug. 6.â According to
the latest wireless dispatches
from the island of Hawaii, there
seems to be every indication that
the expected eruption of Kllauea
will soon take place. Rumblings and
slight vibrations of the earth's crust have
been felt by people residing at the Vol
cano House, not far distant from the vol
cano. Large numbers of passengers are
taking the island boats to Hilo in the
hope of seeing Kilauea in action.
The platform of the party, while not yet
presented, will embrace an antl-tru3t
plank, a plank favoring the fellow ser
vants' or employers' liability bill and a
statement in regard to general primaries
for the election of United States Senators.
So far as known, there will be no men
tion of W. J. Bryan or free silver in the
platform. The most notable Incident of
the day was the lack of applause when
R. H. Pollard of Richmond said: "Frea
silver Is a dead issue. It met Its Gettys
burg In 1S96 and Its Waterloo in 1900."
After an hour of? uproar and disorder,
which required the services of the ser
geant at arms and some police officers to
quell, the convention nominated' Joseph E.
Willard for Lieutenant Governor over Dr.
George W. Lecato, the candidate of tho
tidewater section. The convention ad-^
journed after midnight amid great confu
sion, without having begun the contest
for Attorney General and without having
received the report of the committee on
resolutions. These matters will be taken

NORFOLK, Va., Aug. 14.â The Demo

BY VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS
I have been charged to employ all means
within my reach to strengthen and draw closer
the ties cf mutual understanding and harmony
that blQ-1 our respective countries. Colombia,
from the dawn of Its Independent existence, has
cultivated with solicitous care the friendship
of the United States, seeing in this great peo
ple political models to imitate, lessons in re
publicanism and democracy to learn, exatnplcj
to follow and hopes to realize. These moral
bonds shall be further strengthened when the
strong arm, already destined by Providence,
sunders the itshmlan chain that seems to unite
but in reality separates by hundreds of miles
two vast portions of the American -Continent.
Minister Silva was formerly the Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs in Colombia,
The Venezuelan Consul to San Fran
cisco, Enrique de Laveaga, is* in Mexico,
and there is no representative of the Ven
ezuelan Government in this city.
"President Sanclemente is not transact

Colombia. He is. quite old, and the active
duties of the 'Presidential office are in the
handtj of Vice * President r Jose Manuel
Marrpqulp.. , You must excuse me from
discussing our relations with any Euro
pean Government In case of interference.
I cannot consistently talk about that.
There is no question, however, regarding
the friendly feelings that the. people of
Colombia entertain toward the Govern
ment of the United States. When the
United States recently had trouble with
Venezuela about the asphalt deposits and
the United States Minister was withdrawn
by request the people of Colombia, seeing
tho lenient tieatment on the part of the
United States, perceived that this great
people do not have any tendency that is
hostile to the other American republics.
There is no question In our minds that Lhe
United States is friendly, and this coun
try, if it acts at all, will take the position
of our protector. The sentiment of our
people toward the United States has been
aptly expressed by Senor Carlos Martinez
Silva, our Minister at Washington, when
he said:
The harbor bill Is the work of an Irish
electric railway company, promoted by S.
G. Fraser, an engineer of Dublin. The de
signs appear in the initial stages. Nego
tiations have been announced for the be
ginning of the work. It is understood
some American capital has been guaran
teed in connection with the steamship ser
vice.. It is also understood that the enter
prise, includes an express line across
Southern Ireland and a channel ferry con
necting directly with . the Great Western
Railroad for London. The cost of the
Berehaven harbor works 'and the railroad
will be Â£900,000.
In the House of Commons to-day dur
ing the discussion of the naval works bill
Prettyman (Conservative) advanced as an
argument in favor- of the expenditure for
coaling facilities the recent report of the
United States Bureau of Equipment, say
ing Great Britain could not afford to be
behind the United States in this matter.
The bill asks for a total of Â£27,500,000 to
Increase the docking accommodations of
the coal depots and reserves of ammuni
tion. ' The construction of the Malta

tween Colombia and Venezuela. During
our war that has been In progress the last
two years, large \ bodies of Venezuelans
have taken part against the Government
of Colombia. Some of these bodies have
included 3000 men. They have espoused
the cause of the liberals. The! claim of
the liberals is that the church party In
Colombia Is narrow and oppressive. That
is not the tnth. In sixteen years of
power the churc'i party, although it has
been compelled to meet with the uprising
of the liberals, has advanced the Interests
of the country, has improved its cretlit

velopment with the coming of peace. This
is the belief and understanding of the

LONDON, Aug. 14.â The House of Lords
took an unusual step this morning in sus
pending the sessional order with the ob
ject of passing on its second reading the
bill granting special powers to build a pier
and other works at Berehaven, in Bantry
Bay, Ireland, in connection with the pro
posed '. steamship line from Berehaven to
the United States, by which it is hoped
the voyage will be accomplished in four
and one-half days. The bill had already
passed the House of Commons.
Lord James of Hereford remarked that
such great public interests were concerned
that the Government desired to pass the
bill at the present session. He added that
the promoters desired to construct har
bor works, with the object of inaugurating
a line of steamers' to the United States.
The steamers will be built in Great Brit
ain and will accomplish the voyage . in
four and one-half days. The assent of the
Admiralty officials, who are constructing
naval works at Berehaven, had been
given for the building of the proposed
works on the foreshore. <
NAPLES, Aug. 14.â The funeral ot Slg

Cordons of troops lined the route, which

with sable trappings.
The cords of the pall were held by thÂ»
Mayors of Rome. Naples, Palermo and

Mary Bollinger, his second wife, property

The legal action taken thus far has been

The fact that the run of salmon on

j*s^ APTAIN* CHARLES LE BRETON.
/7 one _ of the best known and most

tary and cashier of the J. C. John

at an early hour yesterday morning in
the bathroom of his residence, 230 Dolores

covered too late fot medical assistance
to have been of avail. The body was re
moved to the Morgue. An inquest was
held a few hours later and a verdict of
"suicide while temporarily Insane" was
rendered by the jury.
| For years Captain Le Breton had been
/a sufferer from catarrh, from which he
f failed to find relief. Night after night he
paced the floor in a vain endeavor to tire
himself out that he might sleep. The
dread malady at length preyed upon his
mind. But sleeplessness at night did not
deter him from attending to his duties
during the day. and the members of the
firm say that bis books were models of
the bookkeeper's art.
Lately, it is said, fearlnp the loss
of his position on account of the dullness
of trade, he became morose and silent.
But the members of the firm say that
such an idea was furthermost from their
minds. He had been in the employ of the
firm for over forty years, and also man
agred the estate of the late J. C Johnson.
He enjoyed the confidence and esteem of
his employers, and an examination of his
books showed that his accounts were per

Although long since retired from active
service. Captain Le Breton .always main
tained an interest in the National. Guard.
One of his chief delights Â¦was to visit the
armory of his old company and night
after night talk over the days that he had
passed in active service. He joined the
organization known as the Veteran
Guards Association, and for over twenty
years handled thousands of dollars of its
funds, and also the funds of the company
of which he was captain. His late com
rades are arranging the details of his
funeral.-
From the ranks Captain Le Breton rose
by successive promotions to the position
of captain of one of the companies com
prising the Nationals, as Companies C
and G were popularly known. He was
thoroughly versed in every detail of the
infantry tactics, and his company was al
ways* considered one of the most thor
oughly drilled in the city. He was one
of the crack marksmen of the guard, and
was one of the teum that went East to
compete with other National Guard or
ganizations for the celebrated Centennial
trophy on the Creedmoor range. The team
of which' he was a member brought back
the beautiful bronze trophy with them to
California.
Captain Le Breton leaves a wife and
two children. His remains, after the in
quest, were removed to an undertaking
parlor and will be removed to-day to the
National Guard Armory on Ellis street,
where they will lie in state until to-mor
row afternoon, "tv-hen they will be burled
with the full military honors befitting his
rank.
Edward H. Korton, a member of the
Urm, said that Captain Le Breton was the
best bookkeeper and cashier he ever
knew and that no (question could be raised
as to his accounts. They left the office

midnight he went into the bathroom, and
as he did not return for some time an en
trance was forced and he was found lying
on the floor in a pool of blood, with a
gaping wound in the throat. Medical aid
was summoned, but he was beyond as

Eight lawyers and thirty witnesses,
most of the latter being neighbors of Con

Marion Baker, a pioneer, who came to
"Whitman County twenty-nine years ago

ser, and was as intimately acquainted
with the latter as any one ever became,
says Gilliam was v.ith Conatser when he
came there, but left the country in 1S74,
having- sold his claim, and was never
seen there again. Baker says Conatser
always kept a horse saddled and bridled
near his door in early days, and told him
that he was on the lookout all the time
and that a coyote could not come on the
ranch without him seeing it.
Conatser was. well educated and took
many papers and magazines. He came to
Colfax thirty-five years ago, when but
few white settlers had arrived, and lived
the life of a hermit in a log cabin. He
did his own cooking. He accumulated
property, and at the time of his death

other property, of a total value of $90,000

was , all that saved the : allied Republican

In - the ' Forty-fourth District, where Abe
Ruef, representing the. Primary League,
fought the pluckiest battle ever, seen In
the political arena of -San Francisco, the
Democrats who voted for their own party

The returns practically establish the fact
that Kelly and . Rainey were forced to
rally four hundred ' Democrats to over
come the immense Republican Â¦ vote cast
for Mr. Ruef. All the energies Â¦ of the
allied bosses were combined: to defeat
Ruef because he was the leader, whose
presence in the _. convent! on they most
feared. . According to declaration made

THE political bosseB are already

hardly begun when the smaller
bosses of the alliance, suspecting that
Kelly might become arrogant and dicta

their knives for his undoing, it is said
that Kelly met their assaults with a

keep what he had won. He recognized
the sly politicians who were seeking to
break his leadership in the boss camp as
the brush workers who were out of sight
when the battle was on. but who quickly
sprang from cover when the flght was

"When a patient calls at a drug store to

Just as good it may. be that he does. not

In some cases .catarrh has a tendency
to become chronic, and it not Infrequently
sets up disease that finally proves fatal.
Peruna taken in time will prevent, these
cases. To substitute. some other remedy
means dangerous delay. â¢
It Is " certainly Â¦ a great responsibility

patient may depend upon having the Pe-

As pretty a finish as was ever seen on a
Santa Rosa track marked the third race
of the day, a five furlong dash. Five of
the runners appeared in answer to the

bart up, had slightly the best of it.' but at
the last moment J. L. Rector's chestnut
mare Lou Clieveden came alongside and
if the wire .had been a few feet further
away she would have won the race. As
it was, Blue Bell got the decision by a

The six-furlong dash for runners proved
an Interesting event. There -were four en
tries, and of these B. F. Hobart's'chest

and Coming Event at 3 to 2, with John

NEW YORK. Aug. 14.â The regatta
committee of the Uarchmont Tacht Club
announced positively to-day that the Con
stitution and Columbia will sail the first
race of the series on Friday, August 16.
The Constitution was the first to run
Into the calm streak, being then about an
eighth of a mile ahead and slightly to
windward. The Columbia carried the wind
a little longer and ran up on even terms.
Then, for half an hour, there was not
enough wind to stir the racing pennants
and, seeing no hope of a finish until long
after dark, at 3:22 both boats gave It up.
NEWPORT, R. I., Augr. 14.â After a
drifting match of three hours and forty
minutes to-day the Columbia and Con

boat had steerage way and the outer mark
was still over four miles away. The race

CHICAGO. Aug. 14.â The Canadian
yacht Invader won again to-day In a
grand race, and the Canada's cup g023
back across the border, but accompanied
by five challenges.
Captain William Hale Thompson and
the crew of the defeated Cadillac were
beaten at all points of the game by th<5
more skillful Canadian skipper and
sailors.
Both the Chicago and Columbia Tacht
clubs challenged Immediately for the cup.
The Rochester Yacht Club and two Detroit
yacht clubs also challenged. The Cana
dian commodore says he cannot tell 'which,
of the five will be given preference.
That Captain Jarvis and his skilled and
well trained crew deserve most of the
credit for the Invader's success is the al
most unanimous opinion of experienced
yachtsmen who have watched closely the
serie3 of races, and the question most
often asked to-night Is whether the win
ner is really the better yacht. -
The Invader was designed by Sibbiclc
of Ryde, England. From his design and
plans the boat was built by James An

FIGHTER CRIBB
DIES SUDDENLY
Found Dead in Bed After

Letters From Australia In
dicate Foul Play as
* the Cause.
Otto Cribb, the Australian pugilist, is
dead. This information "is contained in
the Sydney news advices and in letters
received In this city by Cribb's brother.
On'the night of July 22 Cribb fought
"Micky" Dunn in Sydney before the Gay
ety Athletic Club. The fight lasted nine
rounds and ended in a knockout, Dunn
being the victor. The next morning Cribb
Â¦was found dead in bed.
In a letter from Otto Cribb's mother to
his brother in this city the charge of foul
play Is stated as the cause of death. After
'the post mortem most of the principals
concerned in ! the contest -were formally
arrested. â¢
Cribb's right name was Alfred Otto
Simpson. He was of Jewish extraction
and bore quite a reputation In Australia
before coming to this country. In this
city he' first met Frank McConnell, whom
he knocked out in a "few rounds. Then
he wae matched with Alec GreggatnB'
â¢whirlwind fighter "Dutch" Thurston. In
a twenty-round go of fistic churning and
flalllike fighting Cribb andThureton mixed
it up incessantly. A draw was the result,
and another match was made and fought,
Thureton getting the decislon.-
While in this city George Hartlng; was
Cribb's manager. Cribb earned quite a
<^eal of money in his time, fighting every
body that came along and. winning nearly
all his figtits. He lost a considerable
amount of his hard earned purses by try
ing the horses at Tanforan and Oakland
last season.

men. .
Frank James, a non-union longshore
man of 137 Howard street, was brought
to the Emergency Hospital 'from Jackson
and East streets last night, where a long
gash on his hand was sewed up. He
claimed that he had been attacked by two
strikers, one of whom held him while the
other slashed' him with a small knife.' /
B. C. Kimel, a longshoreman, while on
his' way to work at the Pacific Mail dock
yesterday "morning at 5 o'clock, was set
upon by a gang of strikers at Fourth and
Townsehd streets and badly beaten about
the head and face. After getting away
from the strikers he made his way to
the Emergency Hospital, where his
wounds were dressed by Dr. Bauer.-
Many of the retailers, however state
that there is a scarcity of coal here and
that the fear of a famine is well founded.
The wholesale coal dealers deny that
there is any need to fear a coal famine.
They claim. that there is plenty of coal
in the harbor and assert that they have
not yet been compelled to cut the orders
cf the retailers. They | admit having
stopped supplying Wellington coal, but
claim that such action was necessary in
order to prevent a -failure in complying
with Government contracts.

The work of unloading the colliers in
the harbor is being accomplished under
great difficulties. Two full gangs of men
are working on the Tellus. but the best
they can do is to take out 250 tons a day.
They have been at work on the Tellus for
eight days and she is still far < from dis
charged. There are three colliers dis
charging at the Oakland long wharf and
two are discharging into barges In the
stream. The vessels in the harbor loaded
with coal," with the number of tons they
have in their holds, are as follows:

Since July 1, 616 permits to carry wea
pons have been granted and 276 special
police officers have been appointed.
Chief. Sullivan, in reply to Mahoney,
stated that the men who asked to be al
lowed to carry arms were employed in the
neighborhood where trouble was immi
nent, and that the special officers were
appointed so that he could relieve the
regular officers from the duty of protect
ing non-union teamsters and restore them
to their beats throughout the city.
The motion to grant the requests of the
employes of the steamship /companies,
McNab & Smith and the detective agency
was carried, Commissioner Mahoney alone
voting no.
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
SEVEN people were granted per
mission to carry concealed wea
pons last night by the Police
Commissioners and 246 special po
licemen were appointed to take
the places of the regular officers who
have been detailed for duty with drivers
of teams. Sixty of the specials were ap
pointed at the reauest of-,McNab &
Smith, draymen, and 186 were appointed
at the request of John Curtin of Curtln's
Detective Agency. Most ot those granted
permits to carry weapons are employes
of the various steamship companies, and
will perform the duties of watchmen.
The only opposition to the granting of
the permits and the appointment of the
specials was made by Commissioner Ma
honey, who delivered a short spe.ech in
which he said that he could not see the
necessity for such action on the part of
the Commissioners, as he knew of no
deeds of violence committed which re
quired a force of armed men to prevent.
The committee expects to receive a re
ply, to its communication to-day. Chair
man Salfieid stated that he was Informed
the Employers' Association would appoint
the desired committee. Should that body
decline to take' the desired step the com
mittee will meet, the City Front Federa
tion", and arrange" other plans, one of
which it is hoped will meet with ap
proval.
San -.Francisco. August 14, 1901,
We respectfully ask that your association ap
point a committee of eight from among Its
members, for the purpose of meeting a com
mittee of like number from the Federation of
Labor and the above-mentioned committee from
our organization, and that you advise us at
the earliest possible moment of your decision
in the matter, together with the names of the
persons appointed to represent your association.
Respectfully submitted,
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE . OF THE
COMMITTEE OF ONE HUNDRED.
CD. SAL.FIEL.D, Chairman.
EMANUEL. A. LORENZO. Secretary.
Pursuant to this resolution the chair ap
pointed the following committee: Hon. H. V.
Morehouse, Nathan Bibo. W. J. Kenney. H. N.
Miller, Charles Alpers, Joseph Rothschild and
William H. Barnes.
Employers' Association of San Francisco,
Mills Buildingâ Gentlemen: At a meeting of
the executive committee of the Committee of
One Hundred of the Municipal Federation of
Improvement Cluba of this city, held at the
office of H. V. Morehouse. a motion was unani
mously adopted that a committee of eight be
appointed by the chairman of said executive
committee, and that a like committee of eight
be requested to be appointed by the Employers'
Association, and that a like committee of eight
be requested to be appointed by the Federation
of Labor, making a committee of twenty-four
members, for the purpose of considering all
questions having- reference to the immediate
or early settlement or adjustment of the strikes
and lockouts now existing In this city.
After some further discussion the fol
lowing letter was ordered to be sent to
the Kmployers' Association:
"The association has given its ulti
matum," resumed Mr. Furuseth, "and the
strikers have given theirs. Now what
shall be done?"
At this juncture Andrew Furuseth, sec
retary of the Sailors' Union; L. J. Barry
of the Coalhandlers' Â¦ Association, J. C.
Williams of the Longshore Lumbermen
and A. M. Cunningham of the same body
appeared on the scene. Mr. Furuseth was
informed of the proposition under discus
sion, and he gave his approval to the plan.
He said the strikers were desirous of
bringing the strike to an end. The City
Front Federation had done all In Its
power to placate the Employers' Associa
tion, but that body had persistently re
fused to treat with the strikers.
The proposition was advanced to' ap
point a committee of eight to treat with
a like committee of the Employers' Asso
ciation and another to be appointed by
the Federation of Labor. It was believed
that these committees could arrange mat
ters to the satisfaction of all concerned
and terminate the strike.
In calling the meeting to order Chair
man Salfieid said that it was highly im
portant that a solution of the labor ques
tion in this city be found without delay.
The strike was sapping the vitality of the
community and the public was desirous
of seeing the controversy close with honor
to both parties.
THE executive committee of the
committee of one hundred of the
Municipal Federation of Improve
ment Clubs has sent an appeal to
the Employers' Association which,
the members of the committee say, will
speedily end the strike if the gentlemen
composing that body will consent to ap
point a committee of eight to meet like
committees of the Municipal League and
Federation of Labor.
At the meeting of the executive commit
tee at 508 Montgomery street yesterday
afternoon there were present C. D. Sal
field, chairman; W. J. Kenney, as president
of the Cycle Board of Trade; N. B.
Greensfelder, president of the Municipal
League; H. N. Miller, H. V. Mo rehouse,
Nathan BIbo, William H. Barnes, M. R.
Robert, Joseph Rothschild, Charles Al
pers and Secretary Emanuel A. Lorenzo.
At the meeting of _Ta"nners' Union 9018
held, last night at.7 M acrmerbund Hall,
Twenty-fourth street and Potrero avenue,
the action of the . twenty-five > men who
quit work last week rather than handle
leather hauled by non-union teamsters
was discussed at length, but no, action
was taken. The men have all returned to
work, and it was thought best to let the
matter rest. -Â»
TannÂ»rs Will Not Strike.
It is asserted by those who are familiar
with the Governor's attitude toward the
controversy that he will not take up the
role of mediator, and that the letter from
the labor leaders was 6ent at the request
of San Francisco merchants who are urg
ing settlement of the strike. . -
Andrew Furuseth of the City Front
Federation and Edward Rosenberg, secre
tary of the Labor Council, refuse to dis
cuss the statement sent to the Governor.
A statement of their side of the labor
controversy has been sent to Governor
Gage by the strike leaders. President
Goff of the Labor Council says it was sent
several days ago, but whether at the Gov
ernor's request or not he does not know.
STRIKERS ADDRESS GOVERNOR.
After enumerating the acts which the
council deems sufficient ground for Mr.
Newhall's retirement from office the de
mand is again made that he be removed.
Alluding to the police on wagons, the
council adds that the labor representa
tives were by that act deprived of the pro
tection guaranteed them by the law. Their
complaints were unheard, and, as far as
the strikers were concerned, "they might
as well bring an action against the devil
and hold court in h ."
It is also charged that Mr. Newhall is
responsible for the troubles that grew out
of the strike by his act in sending out
wagons under police protection, notwith
standing the city and strikers were peace
ful, and that the necessity for his act did
not exist. The letter goes on to say that
the enemies of labor, inspired by his ex
ample, are sending out men who commit
acts of violence for no other purpose than
to discredit the cause of the strikers.
Mr. Newhall's letter also comes in for
some bitter criticism. It Is declared to
be a tissue of falsehoods and puerile be
yond conception. The letter asserts that
"if Mr. Newhall had the instinct of a
gentleman he would not have put the
Mayor to the task of defending him
against public opinion."
The Mayor's statement that Mr. New
hall had no prejudice or bias against the
workingmen of San Francisco Is declared
by the council to be an evasion of the
question. Th* Mayor Is requested to rise
above petty trivialities, and to remember
that the workingmen of this city are not
children to be fooled by even so exalted
a personage as the Mayor. The statement
is made that "the people are the govern
ment and that they will not permit the
government to be used against their In
terests"; that "the government must not
be turned Into a government of a clique,
against the people and for the employ
ers."
The San Francisco Labor Council, at its
meeting last night, prepared and for
warded an open letter to Mayor Phelan
relative to the demand of the labor or
ganizations for the removal of Police
Commissioner Newhall. The statements
in the letter are a sharp criticism of Mr.
Newhall's official actions during the strike
and the demand for his immediate re
moval is reiterated. The Mayor is ac
cused of insincerity of purpose when he
sent out his reply to the original letter
demanding Mr. Newhall's removal from
office. It Is claimed that he does not per
form his whole duty without fear or
favor.
Police Commissioner's Removal.
Labor Council Reiterates Demand for
insists on newhail'S head.
"I emphatically deny," Stewart Menzies
said, "that any such offer was made. I
sent one of my clerks a day or so ago
to members of the City Front Federation
and asked them for permission to have
my vessels loaded at Port Costa. The per
mission was refused me and my clerk then
asked if a monetary consideration wa.-j
necessary to secure it. That is all I have
to say about the matter other than to re
port that there is no truth in it."
"Young Menzies made a direct offer of
$10,000 for the privilege desired." Andrew
Furuseth said : last night. "The story Is
absolutely true, and that is all I care
to say about it for publication."
The merchants saw the hopelessness of
further appeal, and returned to their in
sistance that Menzies & Co. redouble
t .ieir efforts to load the vessels. The re
sult was the interview concerning which
there are two versions.
The labor leaders refused to grant the
request, and explained that the purpose
of a sympathetic strike was to make al
lied industries suffer so that pressure
would be brought to bear upon the em
ployers that would force them to con
cede the demands of the employes.
Fruitless Conferences.
The most prominent grain merchants
took the subject up last week and sought
in vain to get permission for union steve
dores to work at Port Costa, They held
several meetings, at which the firms of
George W. McNear, Balfour, Guthrie &
Co., Eppinger & Co. and Gin-in & Eyre
were represented. They arranged confer
ences with the labor leadersâ members of
the executive committees of the City
Front Federation and the San Francisco
Labor Councilâ and tried to get the strike
order revoked in so far as it applied to
grain loading at Port Costa. They argued
that the farmers of the State were suffer
ing unjustly, and that the differences be
tween the San Francisco jobbers and the
unions were not approaching any nearer
settlement in consequence of the gorging
of the warehouses and the threatened
losses to the farmers of the State.
The grain merchants have been urging
upon Menzies & Co. that they get men to
work and put the grain thai has gorged
the warehouses into the holds of their
vessels, In accordance Â¦with the contracts
which they hold. This firm of contracting
stevedores lead practically all of the grain
at Port Costa. Since the City Front Fed
eration issued its general strike order the
firm has been powerless to move. It has
been forced to witness the gorging of the
warehouses until shippers in the interior
have been notified not to send consign
ments until relief from the tie-up is se
cured. Grain Is accumulating in interior
warehouses, on wharves along the water
ways of the great grain raising valleys,
and countless sacks of it are being left
piled in the fields since the natural chan
nels for its transportation are choked.
Merchants TJrge Stevedores.
Mr. Furuseth said last night that Men
zies' offer was made by the stevedore's
son in person, and that it was a direct
offer of $10,000 for the concession he
sought.
Stewart Menzies denies emphatically
that such offer was made by him or for
him. He says that a clerk from his office
was sent to ask if there were any pros
pect of the strike order being recalled so
tar as Port Costa was concerned, and
that this clerk asked if a monetary con
sideration would have any influence in se
curing such recall.
The interview was reported to the ex
ecutive committee, according to Mr. Fu
ruseth's version of it, and the labor lead
ers looked upon the alleged offer as a
sort of bribe to swerve them from their
fidelity to the principle involved in the
use of the sympathetic strike to enforce
labor's demands. Much indignation was
felt and the offer was the subject of much
excited conversation at the labor head
quarters.
made a proposition to the City
Front Federation that permission be
granted union stevedores to accept work
from his firm at loading grain ships at
Port Costa in order that the firm might
carry out Its contracts with the grain
merchants and shipowners. In return for
the special privilege which he sought Men
zies offered the City Front Federation
$10,000 outright. The executive committee
of the federation had the proposition sub
mitted to it yesterday evening, Furuseth
states, and it promptly rejected the offer
of the contracting stevedore.
ANDREW FURUSETH, chairman
of the executive committee of the
City Front Federation, alleges
that Stewart Menzies yesterday

CITY FRONT FEDERATION SCORNS SUGGESTION
OF MONEY PAYMENT FOR SPECIAL PRIVILEGE
"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 2. 1901.â James D. Phelan. City Hall, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: Your communication of
August 1, 1901, with reference to the present differences between the members'of the Draymen's Association and the mem
bers of the Brotherhood of Teamsters has been submitted by me to the executive committee of the Employers' Asso
ciation. In pursuance of your request for a reply, the Employers' Association instructs me to express its attitude con
cisely as follows: #
"The Employers' Association is willing to t recommend to the members of the Draymen's Association that they fill
all present and future vacant positions in their service by such persons as may apply for work,' irrespective of whether
the applicant belongs to a union or not, ; upon. the following terms:
"Firstâ That the employe will obey all lawful orders of his employer. '
"Second â That the employe will not, directly 'or indirectly, attempt to compel a fellow-employe against his free
â¢will to join a labor union, nor to compel his employer to employ none but union men.
"Thirdâ That the employe will not, directly or indirectly, engage in or support any sympathetic strike or boycott.
"I am instructed to define the attitude' of the Employers' 'Association with regard to unionism as follows:
"First â The association recognizes the' right of labor to organize to ameliorate its' condition.
"Secondâ The association has not, in the, matter of employment, discriminated In favor of or against union men and
has no intention of doing so: .
"Thirdâ With, regard to the adjustment of differences between employer and employe, this association has made it
clear In its previous correspondence with you- that the settlement of all such differences must be left to the employer
and his own employes", without interference . from the officers or members of any, labor organization.
"Fourthâ It has been the practice of this organization not to discriminate against any employer of labor solely
because he has in his employ none but union men, and it is not the intention of this association to depart from that
practice. Tours truly. . â¢ â¢ M. F. MICHAEL."

There are a great many preparations that
are recommended for the removal of
freckles, but all are of a nature that cause
the outer skin to peel off, and the use of
such ought not to be attempted except
under instructions of a competent physi
cian. "New Remedies" gives the follow
ing recipe translated from a German
medical journal. Of its efficacy this de
partment knows nothing: Sulphocarbo
late of zinc, 2 parts; glycerine, 24 parts;
rose water, 25 parts; spirits, 5 parts; dis
solve and mix. The freckled skin is to be
anointed twice a day with the prepara
tion, which is to be allowed to remain on
from half to one hour and then washed off
with cold water. Anaemic persons should
also take a mild ferruginous tonic. In the
sunlight a dark veil should be worn.

TO QUERIES BY
CALL READERS
THE SAN- FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY^ AUGUST ] 15, 1901.
When the" car stopped he was asked
what he thought of it, and his answer
.-was a politely evasive "comment on the
greatness of the American people. Later
on, however, he admitted that he had no
complaint to makeâ he was out for sensa
tions and he got them.
He asked the attendant in an anxious
tone whether they went through the
agony again, and seemed relieved at the
assurance that it was all over.
And it came! Very gently at first. It al
ways does, you know. Smooth, easy sail
ing it is until you reach the top of the
semi-circle, making for the loop. Then
Minister Wu held his breathâ held it
tight. In an Jnstant he was standing on
his head, dangling from a high rail up In
the air, his august head pointed earth
ward, his noble queue swinging madly
twixt earth and heaven â a curious, situa
tion for his Excellency, Wu Ting Fang!
Another instant and it was over. They
had swung around to the top of the in
cline, and Minister, Wu found his breath
again.
He settled his cap more squarely on his
head, hesitated whether to put his goggles
on or off, hid his fan. somewhere in the
voluminous folds of his gown and braced
himself for what was to come.
around and land laughing, but unhurt, at
his feet again. And he decided that what
didn't fease an ordinary American girl
ought not- to be too much for a Chinese
mandarin and Minister. So Wu climbed
in.
So Minister Wu watched Miss Heck fly
Still he watched the cars and their-'hu
man freight whirling around the big
circle, and still he did not understand
why they did not drop out. He ap
pealed to his own party. Had any of
them ever done it? .Several of them had.
Did they like it? "Immensely!" This
with enthusiastic conviction from Miss
Blanche Heck, who has the "loop" habit
pretty well developed. Wait, and she'd
show him.
At first he merely looked on and asked
questions, plenty of questions, so many
questions that the manager, who under
stood the theory as well as the practice
of the "loop," had to be brought out to
elucidate. â¢'
It Is just back of the Rudolf, where
Wu is Btaying. The rush of the cars, as
they make the fatal flop, is frequently
audible above the roar of the breakers
on the beach. Wu had, of course, asked
what the weird thing was, and how It
worked. He was anxious to try it. but a
little shy of going it alone. So a party
was made up and Minister Wu was
taken over to see the wheels go round,
and to go round himself, if he would.
things quite plain to him, he recklessly
risks his august person in his desire to
find out "just how it feels." With this
laudable desire he has been trying the
"Loop-the-Loop" at Connecticut avenue
and the Broadwalk.
New "York has succeeded in convicting a policeman
for taking a bribe, and it looks as if Tammany Hall
were 'really losing its grip.
"Well, erâ yes. Until a young woman
gets to.be 24 or 25 her age Is always un
certain. '". That hat's; too old for you." â
Philadelphia Press. Â¦ ~. .
."Well," remarked the milliner, un
guardedly, "that would be becoming, to
young ladies of a certain age."

What Mr. PuÂ£dy says about a "land mortgage tax
is perfectly correct. If the realty of California is
worth a billion dollars, and a billion dollar mortgage
is put upon it, there is no more property in Califor
nia than there was before. Therefore to tax the land
at a valuation of a billion and the mortgage at a bil
lion, is to assume that the property of the State has
been doubled by mortgaging it/ Our. mortgage tax
is no benefit to the borrower, since he pays the tax
We think that our condensed statement- of his posi
tion was correct, since there is no other inference
possible than thatrealty should pay all the tax. When
the products. of labor, and machinery, manufactures,
credits and money are exempted, there are left but
two sources from which to derive taxes for the sup
port of government, franchises and real estate? ' We
observe that in the membership of the Tax Reform
Association, of which Mr. Purdy is secretary, are D.
O. Mills; Dodd.Mend & Co.; Phelps, Dodge & Co.;
J. Pierpont Morgan- & Co.; W. R. Grace & Co.;

In a letter from Mr. Purdy, which we publish, ex
ception is taken to this form of statement of his prop
osition. We took our statement of his position from
an address delivered by him to the merchants and
manufacturers of Detroit, Mich., oh the 28th of last
April. In that address he said: "Where you ha/e
once exempted from taxation any class of property
which is the product of labor, or the evidence of the
ownership of the property, you will never recede. To
extend encouragement to manufacturing industries
without showing any partiality or favoritism, without
conferring a special privilege,- you must exempt ma
chinery, merchandise, credits and money. Personal
property must always pay a tribute to the owner of
real property, and that tribute will be high where the
advantages of. doing business are great."
THE CALL recently reviewed the position taken
by Mr. Purdy of the New York Tax v Reform
Association, in favor of exemption of personalty
from taxation. We put his statement in this form:
"That personal property pays its tribute to real prop
erty, therefore realty should pay all the taxes and
personalty should be exempt."
THAT ! TRIBUTE TO REALTY.
The supporters of a comprehensive system of pro
tection should be - prepared to make on this issue a
straight fight and without compromise. .The Repub
lican party has in its platform declared for a reci
procity that is not inimical to protection, and has
defined it. ..To. that declaration every member of Con
gress who calls himself a Republican should remain
true. The people have a right to demand such fidel
ity .and should make the demand known. in no uncer
tain-term ; s '. Â¦ - ; ' Â¦ .' . _
While the reports may be exaggerated and to some
extent unreliable, it will not do for California and
other States; whose industries are threatened by the
treaties to ignore them. -The very fact that they are
repeated so often shows that the advocates of the
treaties have by no means given Up the contest. Such
Republicans' as favor them will of course have the
support of the free trade element in Congress and in
the country, for the free traders now perceive that if
reciprocity' of the kind contained \ in those" schemes
can be carried out it will be a comparatively easy task
to undermine the whole protective system by reci
procity methods. ' tT-\ .
The report so far as it relates to the President does
not seem to be well founded, for about the only treaty
affecting Europe that is now before the Senate is that
with France, aijd the ratification of that could hardly
have the effect of allaying any irritation that may be
felt by commercial interests in Germany, Russia and
Austria, the only countries where there has been talk
of retaliation.
One of the most notable of these reports is that
Senator Cullom will probably be chairman of the Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Relations, and as he has
declared himself in favor of the treaties that in itself
would increase the chances of ratification. The Presi
dent himself is reported to be inclined to urge the
approval of the treaties as a means of "allaying com
mercial irritation and preventing threatened European
retaliation by the mutual concessions provided for in
the treaties."
DESPITE the assurances that have been given
from time to time that the supporters in the
Senate of genuine protection are sufficiently
strong to defeat the reciprocity treaties now before
that body, it appears the matter is not one of cer
tainty. Washington correspondents of several of the
leading papers in the East announce that it is under
stood at the capital that while Babcock's scheme 'for
revising the tariff will receive little or no support, a
strong effort will be made to procure the ratification
of the treaties.

Our policy toward our southern neighbors is not
like that of Napoleon toward Germany. We do not
desire to see that continent always divided into small
nations, with small politics, the energies of the peo
ple destroyed by division. We do not desire it for
reasons that inhere in the present disturbed situation.
In the multitude of small nations there is always ma
terial for the peril of European intervention which ex
ists now. One strong continental power would do
away with this disquieting risk. We owe it to our
selves to discourage European intervention by deny
ing the only reward of such intervention, the seizure
of territory. It is the American duty. to prepare for
this emergency by making ready to support the Mon
roe doctrine with every ship, gun and man we can
muster. Â¦â¢*>.l*;.' v -.
The situation is more grave than is understood by
the people of this country. It is so grave, in fact,
that cur Government is justified in keeping the navy
en a war footing and looking well to its powder. The
situation south of us is full of interest and full of
danger. It is also full of great possibilities. Seventy
millions of people are there divided among many
Governments, none of them strong. We would re
gard with complacency an upheaval resulting in one
ftrong. continental government, the United States of
South America.
It is easily conceivable that European interests may
plead for Old World intervention in some form. The
United States cannot prevent a declaration of war by
any European power against any South American na
tion. Nor can we prevent any South American na
tion asking armed intervention of any European
nation. What we can prevent is the transfer of ter
ritory, as the spoil of war or otherwise, by any
American nation to any European power. Such trans
fer would be a distinct violation of the Monroe doc
trine and an act unfriendly to this republic.
WAR is actually on between Venezuela and
Colombia. The aims of each party to the
controversy are such that all South America
may become involved in the struggle. Since Bolivar's
time there has not been such material for a general
conflagration.
TESTING THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
PERSONAL MENTION.
MINISTER WU is notoriously of
an investigating turn of mind,
says the Atlantic City corre
spondent of the Philadelphia
North American. When mere
words will suffice he asks questions.
There are many to bear -witness that he
asks questions.
When It is a matter of sensations and
only personal experience will make
It is a foregone conclusion that in the end we shall
have to undertake the work, and its beginning can
not be much longer postponed. Our forests are vast,
but not so vast but what waste and fire can destroy
them. The alternative is a plain one â either we are
to have forest protection or a barren land. . :
How many more lessons of that kind will the peo
ple of California have to receive before they learn
wisdom from the successive losses? The cost which
the maintenance of an effective system of forest pro
tection would entail would be much less than the
annual loss from fires, and therefore there would be'
a saving to the people in that way without counting
other benefits which would result from forest con
servation.
A day later came this dispatch from Chico: "The
forest fires which have been raging in the mountains
about fourteen miles east of Chico for the past four
days last night reached proportions that alarm the
entire populace from the west â¢ branch of Feather
River to Butte Creek.'' The report* went on to give an
account of residences and farm buildings destroyed by
the flames, and closed by 'saying: "The fire is sweep
ing westward, and it is feared many more homes. will
be destroyed within a few hours. The loss will run
up into the thousands."
During the present week two stories of far-reaching
forest fires have been reported. A dispatch of the
12th. inst. from Redding announced: "One of the
fiercest and most destructive forest fires in the his
tory of Shasta County has raged for four days along
the headwaters of Stillwater,^ten miles north of this
city. * * * Seven farmhouses have been destroyed
and the loss of fencing will be great. * . ? * The
fire is still rushing southward. It has burned over
an area more than twenty miles long and five miles
wide." * '
AT this season of the year almost every day adds
another to the many lessons the people of Cali
fornia have already received "on the urgent
need of establishing a comprehensive system of forest
protection. Fire after fire breaks out, and, while
most of them are promptly extinguished, a consid
erable number sweep on until they do damage'enough
to constitute an important item in the news of the
day.
MORE COSTLY LESSONS.
A Chicago man says he finds that life is joy living
without a stomach. He must have been a steady cus
tomer of the restaurants of the Windy City.
This is a subject that comes home to the rich men
and women of California. Our State university has
an endowment notoriously insufficient. The pinch
hurts along the salary nerve of the institution. The
members of'the faculty, who are admirably fitted for
their work, arc poorly paid, andas they pass away their
places may not be as well filled, because professors
must live decently and not leave their families to pov
erty. Under such circumstances we may witness a de
cadence in the institution. Millions should be added
to the endowment. Let us hope that coming Junes
may see a flush commencement at Berkeley.
The importance of this, is that the income of that
sum goes into the general fund of the fortunate insti
tutions, and will enable the paying, of better salaries
to the professors, tutors and teachers. For this tlfcre
is a crying need. The call upon the higher schools of
America is louder every year. The demand for well
equipped teachers therein is beyond the supply, and
the supply is short because the pay is poor. We have
seen the average income of the teachers in our acade
mies, colleges and universities stated at $1200 per an
num, excluding the salaries of president. At that rate
entering upon a professorial career is accepting gen
teel poverty at the beginning" of a career, with no
prospect of improvement in one's condition. This is
not saying that a fit teacher should make money the
first consideration and the enlightenment of mankind
secondary. But teachers and professors marry, they
rear families, and their work is apt to wear them out
early in life, and everywhere may be found their /wid
ows and children just on the edge of indigence. 1 It is
a distressing condition that ought not to be, and those
who have observed it will rejoice that last June was
a flush commencement, and that so large a part of the
golden shower was added, to endowments to increase
appreciably the salaries of the men and women whose
devotion and genius make our higher schools as ex
cellent as they are.
In the list of amounts Washington University, St.
Louis, leads with gifts to its endowment amounting
to $5,000,000. Brown University, Rhode Island, is
second with $2,000,060 added to her endowment.
Yale is third with $1,667,000, for buildings and schol
arships, and Harvard is fourth with $1,462,075, all for
two buildings for the medical and architectural depart
ments. It is gratifying that of the. total amount so much
was added directly to endowments. In addition to
the seven millions given for that purpose to Washing
ton and Brown, Milliken University received $150,000,
Smith College $101,000, Beloit $350,000, and Syracuse
$75,000, making a grand total of $7,676,000 added to
scholastic endowments.
In this strait and stringency it is gratifying that pri
vate citizens are rallying to the support of higher edu
cation. Last June, the commencement season, was
made memorable by the donation of nearly thirteen
millions of dollars to twenty-four academies, colleges
and universities in this country. 'It was a glad season
to present students and past graduates, and one of
especial cheer to the members of the faculties and
financial offirers who have to struggle to make both
ends- meet.
A great majority of the schools of academic grade,
and above, in this country are limited in their useful
ness by lack of endowment. Their original founda
tion was adapted to the then present demand, but the
growth of the country has caused such an increase in
the demand upon them that their income is insufficient
for the work they are expected to perform. This is
true of the State institutions as well as of the private
foundations. In the public land States the universities
had landed endowments which if retained until now
would have furnished an abundant capital. But the
lands were sold at a low value and all of those insti
tutions "are pinched for money and have to be borne
by the taxpayers as a burden which many resent. The
State University of California is an example of this
profligate waste of a landed endowment, which if held
until it acquired its real value would have produced
about fifteen millions of dollars.
JUNE is the commencement season in bur Ameri
can academies, colleges and' universities. At
that season former graduates make pilgrimage
to their alma mater, to meet again and renew their
college days by mingling with their successors of a
younger generation. It is a season of sentiment, of
reminiscence and of pleasure.
A FLUSH COMMENCEMENT.
Mr. J. Pierpont Moi gan may hold the bomis which
represent the value of the billion dollar steel trust.
He is coming here as a temporary resident. If his
residence became permanent, and his personalty
therefore became taxable here, by what plan can realty
exact from him tribute equal to the tax his billion of
personalty should pay? We ask in the spirit of in
quiry. Henry George's 'theory having got into the
distinguished company of the New York, millionaires;
we desire to see whether it gains anything by that
association.
Mr. Purdy must see that if his theory is correct the
term "exemption" as applied to personalty is mis
used, since the personalty is not exempt because it is
taxed in the form of tribute to realty. It is evident,
too, upon reading his Detroit address carefully, that
the tribute to realty paid by personalty is reduced by
the amount of tax levied directly upon personalty,
and that realty will gain in tribute just the. amount
of direct tax that is taken off personalty, but will pass
it on to the public treasury. - â¢ . <
â¢>Mr. Purdy leaves our question unanswered. We
asked what tribute realty in San, Francisco wpuld get
from Mr. Carnegie, if he established his legal resi
dence here, to balance his exemption from a tax of
three millions,, which would be due on his fortune of
three hundred millions? The theory upon which Mr.
Purdy and the single taxers proceed is that moneys,
credits, the product S)f labor "and < all personalty pay a
tribute to realty, which it really passes on as tax to
the public treasury. If that theory can be demon
strated, the real estate owner appears merely as a tax
collector, and. that method of taking taxes has the
great merit of economy and simplicity. But we
want to -know in what form and how Mr. Carnegie
would pay a tribute of three millions to realty in this
city.
in the form of interest, but it does prevent double
taxation. . , ' .

Giovanni Castagnola, 16 years of age,
was released by Judge Cook yesterday on
a writ of habeas corpus. He was held to
answer by Judge Conlan on July 5 on a
charge of robbery of the person of John
Antonia. Judge Cook held that the evi
dence against the defendant was insuffi
cient, and besides there were fatal errors
in the record, one of which was that no
showing was made as to where the crime
was committed. The boy was arrested on
a new warrant from Judge Dunne's court.
Released and Rearrested.
Jurisdiction in Kobbe Case.
The case of Eric Kobbe, son of General
Kobbe, charged with assault to murder
for shooting the boy Paul "Wisslg while in.
a boat off Fort Mason, was called in
Judge Slogan's court yesterday. Major
Hull, judge advocate at the Presidio, who
at the last calling of the case raised the
question of jurisdiction, submitted his
brief on the point and the Judge continued
the case until August 17 to give the prose
cution time to frame a brief in answer.
Â¦The fourth principle is that of greatest effi
ciency In professional knowledge. The art of
war is the application of Its principles to act
ual practice and of more Importance than the
science. Military problems will be carefully
and timely prepared for solution during Im
portant military drills and maneuvers. The
troops will be frequently occupied in extended
field exercises, such as scouting, reconnolter-
Ing and map-making' expeditions, and other
practical field work. The officers and men will
be required to apply the principles of security
and information to the accidents of the terrain
over which they may be engaged. Wherever
practicable extensive military maneuvers will
be practiced by detachments simulating larger
bodies of troops, but all under the well-defined
system.
The third principle to be observed is the
highest possible physical "development that will
render the soldier capable of the greatest en
durance on the march and on the field of battle.
To this end athletic games are superior to pre
scribed gymnastics that require special appara
tus and marches or increasing length at "at
tention" to those at route step with shambling
gait and irregular cadence. '
. The exchange canteen recreation, or amuse
ment room, as it was originally called, will be
made as attractive as possible, and the recent
law concerning it will be faithfully and loy
ally observed.
Recent reports Indicate the existence of
marked unsoldierly deportment on the part of
some of the troops, a condition apparently cul
tivated' recently under the mistaken Idea that
a certain uncouthness of exterior and laxity of
manners are the essential characteristics of a
soldier. As they are most subversive of dis
cipline and efficiency, offenses of this nature
must neither be ignored nor condoned. Com
manding officers are strictly accountable for
the general appearance of their troops under all
circumstances, whether they be In garrison, in
camp, on the inarch, off duty or on brief fur
lough. Soldiers are as much responsible for
their conduct while off the military reservations
or out of camp as when in garrison.

Merchandise for British Columbia.
The Commissioners have decided that
owing to the strike and the consequent
suspension of business the expenses must
be cut down. The board's revenue has
been seriously affected, and something
must be done. Messrs. Kilburn and Her
old will look into the matter during the
week, and if there is no settlement in the
meantime a number of men will be laid
off next Wednesday.
The Board of Harbor Commissioners
held a short session yesterday. The Un
ion Iron Works sent a communication to
the board in regard to the new floating
drydocks to be erected near the Arctic Oil
Works. They asked that the line of con
struction be deflected a little so as not to
interfere with the launching of vessels
from the shipyards. It was feared by the
Scotts that if built as originally intended
one of the biff warships when sliding into
the bay might crash into the docks. The
matter will be looked Into and rectified.

The Petrel left the cruiser Philadelphia
and the gunboat Benningtonat Honolulu.
On June 12 last the Petrel started from
Hongkong for home. On her way she
stopped at Nagasaki, Yokohama and Hon
olulu, making the run from the latter
place in eleven days. She is commanded
by Captain E. H. Gheen. Lieutenant F.
R. Payne is the executive officer. The
rest of the officers are: Lieutenant J. M.
Hughes. Lieutenant F. E. Eckhardt, Dr.
C. D. Langhorne. Ensign L. C. Palmer,
Ensign C. P. Burt, Ensign George Wash
ington and Paymaster D. M. Addlson. She
has a crew of 119 men, including ten ma
rines. There arc two prisoners for court
martial aboard.
When the orders came to Dewey at
Hongkong to destroy the Spanish fleet
and capture Manila the Petrel was one of
the fleet that went with him. Owing to
her light draught she was always in the
thickest of the fight, and the Don Juan de
Austria, the Isla de Cuba, the Isla de Lu
zon and the Mandanao, which were run on
the beach near Malate to escape the fire of
the fleet, were rendered untenable by the
gunboat.
The Petrel has only three men aboard
who were in the battle of Manila Bay.
Nearly all the others are "time expired"
and are coming home to be discharged.
The three men are Marine F. M. Cramer,
W. E. Harmon. A. B., and J. L. Carlson,
bugler. Jerry, the gunboat's mascot, was
also in the fight. Jerry is a big cat, and
according to the crew knows more than
many a man.
more the gallant little warship has been
in Asiatic waters, and nobly did her part
on that memorable May day when Dewey
won his victory in Manila Bay. In a day
or two she will go to Mare Island to be
put out of commission. She requires a
complete overhauling, and it will be many
months before she will be ready for ser
vice again.
GUNBOAT PETREL, PASSING ARCH ROCK ON HER WAT TO AN ANCHORAGE. THE ROCK IS TO BE BLOWN
UP AT NOON TO-DAY. THE GUNBOAT HAS BEEN FOUR YEARS IN ASIATIC WATERS AND PARTICIPAT
ED IN THE BATTLE OF MANILA BAY.
A certificate on the subject of Instruc
tion for the deaf and dumb was granted
to Mrs. Jennie Bright Holden, she having
passed a successful examination before
the Board of Examiners. Mrs. Holden
will be assigned to a class as soon as
there are twelve pupils desiring to pursue
the study.
Silas White and Miss J. B. Gorman were
placed on the retired list at their own re
quest.
Leave of absence was granted to ML*s
M. E. Mower.
The City Attorney was requested to de
fend the board in the suit brought by Miss
Margaret McKenzie for reinstatement as
principal of the Hancock School.
The resignations of Mrs. L. S. Pierson
and Mrs. Susie F. Cor.klin were accepted.
Miss B. O'Dea was appointed janitress
of the Buena Vista School.
Miss E. Hartrick was transferred from
the Noe Valley School to the Cooper, Miss
J. Hernminsway from the Grant School to
the Mission and Miss C. Lewison from the

Cooper School; Waiter E. Smith, teacher of
ecience in Mission High.
Of the thirteen teachers assigned three
assumed charge of new classes in the
Jackson, Haight and South End schools
to relieve congested attendance. The ac
commodations in several schools are so
limited that the board has been put to the
necessity of renting many outside rooms.
There are now forty classes conducted in
stores and basements, for which the city
pays $730 in monthly rentals. The follow
ing assignments were made:
The assignment of thirteen teachers to
regular classes in the School Depart
ment by the Board of Education yester
day makes Imperative the election of a
number of new teachers. The board de
cided to meet again this afternoon for the
purpose of formulating a plan for such
election. The plan will probably be based
on the suggestions contained in a vol
uminous report recently submitted by a
committee of prominent educators. There
remain but four available teachers on the
substitute list, and the evening school
substitute list of 'twenty-seven teachers
will be drawn on for service.
Board Accepts Two Resigna
tions and Dismisses One
Pedagogue.

DRUGGISTS MUST BE CHARY.
They Sell All Kinds of Hair Prepara-
tions and Fear to Discriminate.
Druggists sell all kinds of hair prepara-
tions, and as a iule they are wisely chary
of giving preference to any particular one,
but many of. them have come out plainly
for Newbro's Herpicide, the new treat-
ment, that absolutely kills the dandruff
germ. H. Swannell & Son, Champaign.
111., say: "One customer of ours who did
not have a hair on top of his head when
he began to use Herpicide now has a fair
start toward a good head of hair. "We be-
lieve Herpicide to be by far the best prep-
aration of its kind on the market." Hun-
dreds of similar testimonials from every-
where. .

The diseases most feared are those which an; 5^^^'**^^^^
inherited â handed down from generation to gen- â¢Mil' p$O'wlÂ»
eration, and family to family. By far the most
destructive of these is Cancer, -which finds the Ki^^MAiuhiim^f^^^^^
greatest number of its victims among the children
and grand-children of those whose blood was tainted
with this dreadful malady. You may carry this poison in the blood for years, but
as the vital powers begin to wane a slight bruise or cut, wart or mole, sore or
pimple may develop into Cancer. From middle life to old age is the time when
the slumbering poison is most apt to break out, a sore or* ulcer often degenerating
into Cancer, and Tumors become more progressive and ulcerate through the skin,
the sharp, shooting pains causing the most intense suffering.
The Cancer patient naturally grows^ despondent as one after another the usual
remedies fail, and the sore shows no sign of healing. The impurities that have
been accumulating in the system, perhaps for generations, cannot be eliminated nor
the poisoned blood made pure by salves, washes and plasters. The proper treatment
is to purify and build up the blood, remove the cause, when the sore or ulcer heals.
S. S. S. goes directly
3!Ir. J. B. Arnold, of Greenwood, S. C, writes: " A i n to the blood, destroys
tiny txlcer came, just Tinder the left eye. It began, the virus, stops the for-
Bpreadiny, and grew worse rapidly, destroying tho mat : on ' t Ca ncerou o
flesh as it went. As Cancer is hereditary in my family nation ot cancerous
I became thoroughly alarmed, consulting- the best phy- cells and cleanses the
siciana and talcing- many blood medicines, none of system of impurities,
which did me any good, when one of our leading' What we say of S. S. S.

KEW YORK, Aug. 14.â Trading In stocks
to-day was spirited because commission houses
reported an increase in outside orders. Devel
opments over night did not shed much light on
either the crop or strike situation. Bull trad
ers resumed active operations. With the
course of the day there was a revival of in
terest of usually dormant stocks which gave
rlee to reports of pool-manipulation, especially
In the United States Leather issues. Current
rumors regarding the dividend status of St.
Paul made that stock the feature of the day
and its fluctuations governed the movement of
other etocks eloeely. Generally speaking, the
properties which were notably strong yester
day resumed their advance to-day, but the
average rise was not so pronounced. The great
bulk of the day's dealings were transacted dur
lns the forenoon when the high prices of the
day were made. London was again a buyer
of the general International list and short*
covered contracts la the grangers and Pacifies,
A wide opening wag looked for In St. Paul,
owing to the active inquiry for the stock in
London where it was two points -higher. The
first eales were 7000 shares at 162'4<5162% ' a
grain of 1V4. Opening advances otherwise were
mostly fractional, but a strong undertone pre
vailed and there was heavy buying In the ac
tive list. Traders met the rise with stock pur
chased at lower prices early In the week and
the beare were disposed to sell the market on
acount cf its pretty general steady lmprove
xrent since Monday's opening. These offerings
reduced and in some instances wiped out al
together the initial advances. -Sugar, which
had started off H4 Ijlerher, was depressed sharp
ly and the Steel etocks were rather heavy.
Prices soon worked upward again, however,
the trunk lines, grangers. Pacifies and coalers
being taken freely and establishing advances of
from' 1 to 2 points. St. Paul ran up 2% to
464% and -the preferred gained 35i. ' After mid
day the market worked slowly downward, 'but
there were occasional rallies which were In
a measure due to the timidity of the 6hort In
terest on indications of inside support to spe
cial etocks. The demand for stocks died pretty
well In. the late afternoon and the bears made
a successful raid against the market, depress
ing St. Paul two points rrom the highest and
putting the active list generally down a point
or over. In the final dealings buying to cover
eauved a general rise. St. Paul got back agaii:
to 164%. the hiirhest figure of the day, and the
entire market closed steady. The closing rally

CHICAGO, Aug. 14.â Higher cables gave
wheat monetary strength at the opening, but
this feeling was quickly displaced by a de
cided break in prices occasioned by the weak
ness in corn and realizing by traders. Con
siderable long stuff came on the market, but
support appeared lacking, commission houses
being the most active buyers. September
opened 9Â»'g%c to %@lc higher at 74%@74%c, but
heavy selling on the part of the locals soon
brought the price down to 72%c. The close was
steady and %@%c lower at 73c.'
Under the influence of higher prices for
wheat, corn opened strong. The advance was
not so marked as in wheat and on the first
sign of weakness In the latter heavy quantities
of the yellow cereal were dumped on the mar
ket and prices declined. Seotember closed %c
lower at 53(f 59%c.
Oats fluctuated within a narrow range and
weakened with corn. September closed %o
lower at 36%c.
Provisions opened practically unchanged but
the market soon developed weakness on heavy
receipts of hogs. The decline in grains was
also a bear factor. September pork at a loss
of 5c. lard 5c lower and ribs unchanged.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

The season In Montana is rapidly drawing to
a close and by next week most of the Mon
tana buyers will have reached home. It Is
estimated that hardly more than 5 per cent
of the clip of that State has been consigned,
the great bulk' of it having been purchased
outright. All the other States and Territories
have likewise been pretty well cleaned up.
The sales for the week in Boston amounted to
11,345,000 pounds domestic and â¢ 1,390,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 12.935.000 pounds,

the corresponding week last year.

New York to look into the seaport mail
service on the American line, preliminary
to instituting a similar service on the
Oceanic line between San Francisco -and
Honolulu, under which a postal clerk will
be aboard each steamer.
The Postmasters throughout the isl

the Americans who were there before the
American regime was installed, include
English, German, Portuguese and other
nationalities. None of the ninety or 100
postoffices on the islands has had to call

WASHINGTON, Aue. 14.â G. Â¦W. Carr.
assistant superintendent in charge of the
railway mail service in Hawaii, was In

volume of the mails in Hawaii has in :

The suit was Drought In John Allman's

brother in the staging business and is en

Miss- Dagmar leaves for Los Angeles on
Friday, and Richard Jose, the great con
tra-tenor, will take her< place.
"Mrs. Dane's Defence." at the Columbia,
continues to draw large and interested
houses to the theater. . Miss Margaret
Anglin's Mrs. Dane is a conception Â»hat
will live long in the memory of local Play
goers, and Charles Richman's splendid
work in support of Miss Anglln will not
be easily forgotten. The engagement is
altogether one of the most notable of this
or any season in the history of the house.
Miss Hilda Spong, the star of the Dan
Frohman Company that will follow "Mrs.
Dane's Defence," has arrived In San
Francisco in company with the rest of tpe
Frohman organization. Miss Spong is
said to be possessed of much personal
beauty and dramatic talent. The com
pany will present "Lady Huntworth s Ex
periment," a new play, by R. C. Carton.
The third week of the grand opera sea
son at the Tlvoll, with "La Favorlta' and
"Otello" for programme, is marked by the
best performances of the season so far.
Agostini has created a furor with his
work In "La Favorita." and the new tenor
is expected to do great things during the
season. Salassa excels himself as Iago in
"Otello." and both operas are admirably
directed by Mr. Steindorff. Montanari has
made a reasonably favorable impression
as Desdemona. but will certafnly do bet
ter work in other parts of her repertoire.
To-night "La Favorlta" will be repeated,
and the interest in the .tuneful old opera
seems fully to equal that taken in the
great Verdi opera that is the alternating
bill. Next week the chief feature of the
whole season, Bolto's "Meflstofele." will
be put on, opening on Tuesday evening,
with Dado, Agostini and Montanari in the
principal parts. The management has
spread itself : on the production, which
should proveâ If it were possible â a great
er attraction than any so far on the bill.
Rossini's delightful "Barber of Seville"
will be given on the alternate nights.
Lunette, the maid of the air. Is still chief
attraction of the good bill of the Chutes
. The Olympla !s offering a spfendld pro

regular amateur performance will be

Three other men appeared" about the
same time and made a report of about the
same character. They state they were
thrown on a southbound freight train
after being roughly handled. One of the
men gave his name as Alfred Nordstrom,
says that he Is a union sailor and that he
was paid off yesterday on his arrival on
a schooner from tha north. He was walk
â¢ing around town when he was. set upon
and beaten and then taken to the head
quarters of the strikers and held prisoner
until near midnight.. He was robbed of
$38 and some valuable papersâ his dis
charge from his ship and his certificate as
an able seaman. His fellow companions
In misery were a bricklayer, who refused
to give his name, and a young man whose
appearance Is that of a clerk. Both tell
the same story of their being held prison

All the men state this is a nightly occur

constable of Mayfield, who* says they es
caped from a car at Palo Alto, and they
tell almost 'an identical story.

that yesterday afternoon he was walking

several times. He was then, according. to
his story, hustled into a room in the rear

BUTTE, Mont, Aug. 14.â The suit of
John Maginnis, vice president and general
Banks is the latest victim. He claims
to have lost a gold watch and chain. This,
he eays, is the most serious theft to date,
but that a system of petty sneak thieving
has been flourishing at the college for
some time, and he, for one, proposes to
have it stopped at any cost. .
Students are in the habit of changing
their street clothes before going into the
dissecting room. They are provided with
lockers for their books, instruments,
anatomical specimens and other impedi
menta. These lockers are also used as
clothes closets. They are under lock and
key. It is from the pockets of street
clothes left in the lockers that the mys
terious sneak thief has been reaping a
harvest. .
Banks says he locked up his coat and
vest at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. He
had occasion to" go to the locker only
once during the day. He left the door
unlocked for a few minutes, and during
that interval a fellow student, at his
(Banks') request, took some wrapping
paper from the locker. Banks returned
later and locked the door.
When Banks at 5 o'clock resumed hia
street apparel he discovered the loss of
his watch and chain. They are both
quite valuable, and after maklne fruit
less search and inquiry about the college
he decided, in view of the previous pecu
lations, to call in the assistance of the
police. ' . ' . _,
The watch is gold, open-faced and
rather small. On the chain, whteh is also
gold, is a moss agate pendant. The agate
is chipped on the lower side. Banks values
them very highly, and the police are al
ready at work trying to recover the spoil
and "discover the thief.
"William H. Banks, a student attending
Cooper Medical College and residing at 968
Valencia street, yesterday called on the
police for assistance in running down a
thief who, he says, has been plying his
trade for some time past at the Sacra
mento institution.

OAKLAND, Aug. 14.â Lewis M.
Ross, farmer, of Occidental, Cal.,
is an enterprising up-to-date sen
tleman. Last March Mr. Koss
decided it was not well for him
to live alone, and acting up to his ad
vanced ideas* he put an advertisement in
the columns of this paper making known
his sad plight and his sincere desire to
alter his unhappy position.
Mr. Ross' petition appeared in the per
sonal column of The Call on March 24
last and read as follows:
FARMER of 40 (Protestant), small means,
good home, desires acquaintance of a lady
(widow with one child preferred): object
matrimony. L. II. ROSS, Occidental," Cal.
The farmer's appeal reached the eye and
touched the heart of many ladles, who
at once took their pens in hand, jotted
down a catalogued description of their
charms and then possessing their souls
in patience waited for the message that
would make an exchange of photographs
not only desirable but necessary.
More than two hundred comforting mis
sives reached the Sonoma County farmer
in answer to his advertisement. He gave
to them all his earnest attention and'
finally, after much mature consideration,
decided upon Lizzie A. Hamilton, who for
the last few years has been in the employ
of Mrs. Ames of 909 Linden street, Oak
land.
Lizzie's letter pleased the advertising
farmer, and when in the due course of
time, after the proper exchange of refer
ences, he met her It was, as far as Ross
was concerned, a clear case of orange
blossoms and frosted fruit cake.
The lady, however, did not capitulate

but it was unsuccessful. ,

of this city is the father-in-law of Burt
Haile, formerly of Alameda, who Is re
ported missing from his home in San
Jose, with a wife and two children anx

Haile's affairs. He found that Haile owed
a large amount of money in San Jose and
that he had a hard time of it heading off
his creditors. He found also that Haile's
troubles were the result of a fondness for
the gaming table, where he lost consid
erable money. Eustace does not think
he has committed suicide.

Supervisor Rowe said: "It would seem
that the title to this land must have,
lapsed before this time as the agreement
to build the road was made twenty years
ago."
Renton. Holmes & Co. of San Francisco,
who are 'disputing the right-of-way with
the Supervisors, were represented by
Clarence Crowell. He said that his clients
hold deeds to the strip of land In question,
conditioned upon the completion of the
road within a reasonable time.
OAKLAND, Aug. 14.â The Board of Su
pervisors met to-day to consider the case

matter to the District Attorney for an

ALAMEDA, Aug. 14.-R. TV. Theobald,
former secretary of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty- to Children In San
Francisco, was on. trial this afternoon in

a verdict of not guilty.

BERKELEY, Aug. 14.â The High School
building now in the course of construction
will not be ready, for occupancy next
Monday, as exnected. Instead of meeting
there the students will assemble in the
Commercial School, on Center street, for
organization. Ihe seniors will meet at 9
o'clock Monday and the mlddlers at 1
o'clock. The juniors will meet Tuesday at
9 o'clock, and the sub-juniors at 1 o'clock.
No date for the opening of the new High
School has been set. The strike is respon
sible for the delay In its completion.
High School Not Heady.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 11. â General Manager
W. F. Kelly says that it is not the inten
tion of the Oakland Transit Company to
cut Alamedaout as the terminus of the
Leona Heights road. The story that such
was the intention arose from a misappre
hension, the transfer point having been
only temporarily changed during the
opening week at Mills College to accom
modate the students. Manager Kelly
states that President Mills has impor
tuned him to transfer to the Haywards
line, but he has refused to do so because
the change would make it necessary to
transfer Alameda-bound passengers twice.
Nothing would be gained at all by the
change and a large portion of the track
would have to be abandoned.
Transfer Point Changed Temporarily.
ALAJIEDA, Aug. 14.â The children of
Mastlck School, formerly the Enclnal
School, will take part In exercises Friday
afternoon at the school in honor of the
rechrlstenlng of the building. The exer
cises will consist of a flag raising, unveil
ing of a portrait of the late E. B. Mas
tick and other ceremonies. The pro
gramme 'will open with "America." Â¦which
Â¦will be sung by the pupils, and then will
follow an address by TV. E. Creed, the
unveiling of the portrait, presentation of
a flag by President Frank Otis of the
Board of Education, salute and the song
"Star-spangled Banner" by the pupils.
The flag is the gift of President Otis.

When the recorder's office closed this
evening 639 persons had applied for ad
mission to the freshman class as regular
students. This is an Increase of fifty
during the past two days and an increase
of nmety-six over the applications re
ceived last year.
To-morrow the upper class men will
register in the gymnasium from 9 a. m.
to 5 p. m. Officers of Instruction will
keep office hours from 9:30 to 12 o'clock,
and at 1 o'clock instruction in some of
the courses will begin. Practically to
morrow will be the first day of the col
lege year. â¢
Drill this year will continue under the
instruction/ of Captain Henry de H.
Walte, U. S. A., retired, who has made
himself exceedingly popular with the col
lege men during his professorship at
Berkeley.
Next Wednesday morning the men of
the freshman class Â¦will be called together
between North and South hall and formed
Into a single line extending along the
roadway running past the two buildings.
Then they will be divided into six compa
nies according to their heights and the
companies subdivided Into squads under
non-commissioned officers for first in
struction in drill. The freshman compa
nies this term will be under the com
mand of the following-named captains:
E. H. Pearce, Company G; \V. H. Popert,
Company H; I. B. Rhodes, Company I;
R. S. Springer, . Company K; N. Vander
bilt, Company L; E. M. Weight, Company
M. The upper class companies will be
A, B, C, r>, E and F.
One of the big days of the college year
will fall on "Wednesday, the 21st inst., for
then the men of the baby class will, be
lined up and formed Into companies for
drill. This event always attracts great
crowds, not only of students, but of vis
itors from neighboring cities. The col
lege women, with hardly a. single excep
tion, assemble in front of the library,
much to the embarrassment of the fresh
men and to the enjoyment of the co-eds.
Unfortunately, for them alone, the juniors
and sophomores are not privileged to see
this event, because they are compelled to
drill elsewhere. The senior men, who just
stepped out of the military harness last
term, get enough sport out of It, however,
for the other two classes. The antics they
perform annually are as amusing as those
of the freshmen.
BERKELEY, Aug. 14.-Work In themM
itary department of the University of
California will commence Monday, when
the upper classes will be assembled for
drill. They will meet at 11:15 a. m. at
the same hour the freshmen are assem
bled In the gymnasium to meet the presi
dent and faculty. The two events' are
carefully arranged beforehand to take
place at the same time. v^f or with the
Juniors and sophomores keeping step over
the campus the freshmen can meet and
depart in undisturbed peace.
Freshmen Will Be Organized
and Divided Into Six
Companies.

The case thus disposed of aroused wide
interest at the time It was tried. Mantel

by endeavoring to have the police depart

line stop his wife as she fled from him
after twenty-four hours as his bride In the
heart of the southern republic. Mantel
was called south by telegraph just before
the marriage was performed, and left im
mediately after it. Instructing his bride
to follow him. She was In no hurry to
comply with his orders, and when the
couple met there was a quarrel, a flight
and pursuit, culminating in the divorce.

REGARD DEATH
AS SUSPICIOUS
Winters was angry yesterday. He ob
jected to being "chucked" into a cell and
demanded the liberty of the corridors as
a reward for assisting Captain Seymour
and his detectives in their efforts to se
cure the, immense reward offered for the
recovery of the gold. Â«
In behalf of Winters, it may be- stated
that when he read the statement he is
alleged to have made he became wroth.
He sent word to. Captain Seymour and re
quested an Interview. The chief of de
tectives was busy and sent word back to
learn what the prisoner wanted. Winters
then informed the messenger that he
wanted Captain Seymour to send him his
pistol, so that he could wipe out a dozen
reporters who were annoying him.
In a tremulous voice, that did not befit
a man who could tunnel his way into a
safe. Winters informed the reporter, that
President A. J. Ralston of the Selby
Smelting Company had solemnly prom
ised to give him $50,000 and use his influ
ence to obtain him a short imprisonment
if he would divulge the whereabouts of
the stolen gold. This story, like others
woven by a vivid imagination, was pub
lished to the world, and the public either
considered Mr. Ralston an easy Vmark"
or Winters a consummate scoundrel.
It was then that his kind-hearted bene
factor made his appearance on the' scene.
He desired some return for his courtesy
to the famous prisoner, and the latter was
not loth to reward him. Winters had no
gold bars to give the journalist, but what
was more useful to the scribe, he would
give him an interview. - '
Some kindly disposed newspaper man
handed Jack Winters, the man who rob
bed the Selby Smelting Company of gold
bars of the value of $320,000, two packs of
cigarettes on Tuesday last and left him
to enjoy them. Winters lit one of the
dainty "coffin nails" and settled back on
his hard settee to dream of liberty and
what he might have done with the gold
bars that he sunk in the bay at Crockett.
His dream was a vivid one. Once again
he conjured up the stolen gold and, like a
smoker of opium, his dream became ro
seate. Suddenly his mind was- brought
back ,to a realization of his surroundings
by the clanging of an iron door, which
was evidence that a prisoner was either
being liberated or, like himself, was being
confined for some crime. ; â¢ '
the Selby Smelting Company. A diver
worked from 10 o'clock yesterday morning
to 5 o'clock in the evening searching for
the missing gold. He found two gold bar3
and turned them over to the company.
There are three bars still missing. These
missing bars in the aggregate value $48,
000. There is some apprehension that the
small bar, which is valued at $3000, will
never be recovered, as it dropped out of
the ; sack when Winters consigned it to the
bottom of the bay. The diver will con
tinue the search to-day.
Sheriff Veale to Take
Winters to the Scene
of His Crime.
Ex-Deputy Sheriff George W. Witty of
Sontag-Evans fame, committed suicide in
a Mission-street lodging-house last night
by shooting himself In the head. A love
affair is said to be the cause of the act.
"Witty was divorced from his wife about
four years ago and since has been living
in this city. He secured an appointment
as a special police officer and worked
from time to time. A few months ago he
met a woman who is known as "Josie "
He fell In love with her and much of his
time and money was devoted to the ob
ject of his new affections. According to
friends Witty believed that the woman

the room of her new guest. She tried the

through his head. No note was left bv
Witty, but the affair with the woman is
said to have prompted him to end his life.
Sheriff Veale and Constable Moiles of
Contra Costa came to the city last even
ing for the purpose of securing Winters.
They held a warrant for his arrest and
handed it to Captain Seymour. The lat
ter called in Detective Dillon and instruct
ed him to book Winters for burglary and
credit Detective Tom Gibson with the ar
rest. This morning the visiting officers
will relieve the local authorities of the
care . of the prisoner. Winters will be
taken before Judge Pratt of Contra Costa
County and a day will be set for a hear
ing. Winters will then be lodged in the
County Jail. . Â¦ â¢ Â¦ Â¦ â¢ â¢ .
.Sheriff Veale and Captain Seymour dis
played none of the feeling that is said to
exist between them. Both officials were
open handed in their treatment of each
other last night and there was no evi
dence of unfriendliness on the part of
either man.
Two more bars have been recovered by
"The postal material In all broken pack
ages was counted, but the unbroken ones
were taken at the department account.
The investigation, however, was incom
plete In this, that the unbroken packages
of stamps were not opened and counted
and were accepted ' as being correct.
Neely stated that on the preceding Sat
urday he had deposited the postal funds
in the xsorth American Trust Company's
Bank, the investigation having taken
place on the following Monday."
"Neely had no postal funds on hand. He
had stamps and stamp paper and other
material, together with a certificate of
deposit from the treasury of the island,
in an amount sufficient to meet all the
balances furnished by the auditor. The
basis of the Â¦ examination, was not made
from the books of the Bureau of Finance,
but from the statements furnished by the
auditor. The money order funds were
counted and corresponded with the state
ments furnished me.
"April 23, 1900, I made an investigation
in the Bureau of Finance of the Depart
ment of Posts in the island of Cuba, the
chief of which was Charles F. W. Neely.
I was assisted by F. C. Neal and E. P.
Hemlin, clerk of the Bureau of Special
Agents. I could not say as to whether
General Rathbone addressed a letter to
Neely or not, but I was told by the Di
rector General that Neely would return to
Havana and that when he returned he
wanted his accounts investigated.
"There was a small excess in the money
order fund, and when Neely's attention
was called to this matter he stated that
he was in some doubt as to the exactness
of his accounts and that he had put in
some money so that there should not be
any shortage. Neely had figures showing
what the balances in his accounts should
be. but who furnished that- information
I could not say. The balances In his pos
session were similar to the ones furnished
to mo from the auditor's office, which
leads me to believe that he was prepared
for the investigation.

Captain Seymour testified to the defend

with others, in his office on April 1. and
the defendant alleged that the signature
of the Judge was genuine. On April 5 the
defendant admitted to him in the Grand

the Judges to the forged bail orders were
forgeries with the exception of Judge
Conlan's. Sullivan said he had so testi
fied to the Grand Jury.
Judge Cabantss testified that his signa
ture on the bail order was forged and that
he had not authorized any one to sign it
for him. John A. Fenton, clerk in Judge
Cabaniss* court, testified that his signa
ture to the order was also forged. Then
came Reis' testimony that he had naid
