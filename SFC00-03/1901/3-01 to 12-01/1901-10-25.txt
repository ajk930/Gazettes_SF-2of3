LONDON. Oct. 25.â "News has been re
ceived here from Teheran," says a dis
patch from St. Petersburg to the Daily
Mail, "of the discovery of a serious plot
agztinst the life of the Shah. The leaders
of the conspiracy were . the Shah's two
brothers, the Grand Vizier, Sadr Aasam,
and the Shah's son-in-law. The two
brothers have been banished for life to
Ardebil. The son-in-law was sentenced
to death, but on the scaffold his sentence
tra:! mitigated by the Shah's firman to
flofging until he had revealed all the
rtaraes of the conspirators.
"The Shah's favorite, Gavame, who
was also concerned, was pardoned on the
scaffold, but died subsequently in prison.
The whole revolutionary ' party, together
with the higher priests, were in the plot
and all will be beheaded or imprisoned for
life. There is a ' veritable panic among
the people of Teheran."

The admiral accordingly â¢ was asked to

proceedings, for which apparently neither
the members of the court, its officers nor
the spectators were prepared, and a mur
mur of surprise was heard on all sides.
It had been expected. that the witness'
name would be reached toward the close
of the afternoon session. There were still
two witnesses , on his list who had not
been heard, and it was understood to bo

WASHINGTON, Oct.. 24.â If political mo
tives were behind the abduction of Miss
Stone, the American missionary held pris
oner by Bulgarian brigands, her liberation
may be effected without the payment of
the ransom originally demanded by her
captors.
Beyond the brief dispatch received by
the State - Department yesterday from
Consul General Dickinson at Sofia, an
nouncing that the party holding Miss
Stone . Is reported to be still In Turkish
territory, the administration has no news
concerning the woman or Mrs. Tsilka, her
companion. " Apparently neither Dickinson
nor Eddy, Secretary of the American Le
gation in Constantinople, Is In communi
cation with the brigands and the lack of
Interest taken by the latter in the ransom
which Eddy is prepared to pay tends to
confirm the suspicion which has been en
tertained for some weeks that political
and not mercenary motives^are responsi
ble for the abduction.
Will' Deal With Brigands.
Uncle Sam Is Determined.
The authorities still believe it desirable,
however,. to appeal to the cupidity of the
\u25a0*rigkB$Â»,*raiÂ»Â«l-iEddy .-wilt use^ a favorable
opportunity to' acquaint them with the
amount of money which Miss Stone's
friends have raised and which he will be
willing to hand over to them upon tho
safe production of the captive.
The authorities have satisfied them
selves that Turkey is in no wise Involved
in the seizure of the American woman
and. all of the reports received by tho
State Department have accentuated the
original suspicion that Bulgaria, as -well
as the Macedonian Committee, notwith
standing explicit denials from the reign
ing prince, was' in sympathy with tlte ac
tion ' of the brigands and hoped that as &
consequence of the crime Turkey would
become involved in trouble with this coun
try. Until Miss Stone has been liberated
the United States will devote Its efforts
to effecting her rescue. In the meantime
it is getting all the information available
establishing Bulgarian complicity and re
sponsibility in connection with her abduc
tion.
At the proper time the United States will
make vigorous representations for tho
purpose of securing adequate reparation,
which will Include an indemnity for Miss
Stone or. in case of her death, for her
heirs. As Bulgaria is situated in the In
terior of Europe it will be Impossible for
the United States to enforce its demands
by a naval or military demonstration.
Russia has been so courteous In endeav
oring to secure the liberation of MI33
Stone that the authorities feel that they
can rely upon her to support her. claim
that Bulgaria shall repair the wrong her
subjects have done an American citizen.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 24.-The mis
sionaries who are operating from Sama
kov. Bulgaria, _ are at last In touch with,
the brigands who abducted Miss Ellen M.
Stone and her companion, Madame Tsilka,
according to dispatches received here to
day, though whether negotiations for the
ransom have actually been opened is not
disclosed. The missionaries on the spot
are expected to conclude the business with
the utmost dispatch.

were received to-day from Colombia to
the effect that the revolutionists have ta

coast, near the Ecuadorian frontier, and
are now marching toward Guapi. which
is -near Buena Ventura. The cablegram
also says that yellow fever 13 epidemic In
Buena Ventura.
. An island has been used by the Colom
bian insurgents to blockade the Colom
bian pert "of Tumaco. This novel method
of enforcing the blockade wa3 officially
brought to the notice of the Navy De
partment to-day In a report dated Octo
ber 14 from Captain Thomas Perry, com
manding the battleship Iowa, which is at
Panama. \u25a0
Captain Perry In^hls report tells of the
firing upon the British steamship Quito by
an insurgent battery and the subsequent
apology by the revolutionary leader to
the commander of the British warship
Icarus.
- If the blockade of Tumaco Is not raised
by the time 'the battleship Iowa is re
lieved at Panama she will probably be
sent to Tumaco to show, that the block
ade is not effective for several reasons,
one is that .the belligerency of the insur
gents has not been recognized and an
other is that there has been given no pub
lic notification of the blockade.
Continuing his narrative, the admiral
said:'- â¢' '\u25a0'â¢' \u25a0â¢-.'\u25a0. I .; i- --'â¢". , : ' * \u25a0'-.' '\u25a0

also told me. which ever side I went on. to

not to risk our battleships against the forti

PBOPOSE TO ESTABLISH
PERMANENT BTJBEATT
The reforms that have been Indicated mark
an important era in the history of discipline
and military Instruction at the academy. Dili
gence and discretion on the part of the re
sponsible officers will make these reforms per
manent without in the slightest degree mar
ring the perfection of drill, appearance and
discipline. The custom among cadets of set
tling' disputes or difficulties among themselves
by prearranged and often brutal fist fights is
over and there need be no apprehension that
the stoppage of such affairs will in any way
Impair a proper habit of manly self-defense
against personal assaults or insult.
Throughout the past summer's encampment,
which is the time when new cadets are being
initiated Into their new life and when hazing
is ordinarily practiced, it is a fact that the
great majority 7 of cadets have obeyed the new
order ot affairs and the regulations loyally and
\u25a0willingly. There has been no prearranged
fighting and new cadet training has made ex
ceptional progress. One cadet was severely
punished for giving an unauthorized and ab
surd^ order to a new cadet and another for
exceeding his authority as a drlllmaster over
them. The action of the latter was. it Is be
lieved, through excessive zeal rather than a
hazing spirit. Another reform has also been
accomplished â the abolition of what is known
as official hazing, or harsh or nagging tones of
the cadet instructors over new cadet3 and cadet
officers exercising authority, and the- substitu
tion therefor, of methods appropriate for the
training and education of young men to com
mand in an American army.
1 The discipline of the. corps of cadets has
greatly Improved durlnr the year and Is now
In an excellent state. It Is believed no mili
tary body of Its size exists which excels it in
soldierly appearance and in the perfection of
drill and military exercises, as well as in the
higher requirements of -devotion to duty. This
satisfactory condition has been attained by
firm adherence to the measures adopted during
the past three years to create among the cadets
a higher soldierly regard for their obligations;
in particular those \u25a0 pertaining to hazing.
He then reviews what has been done,
mentions the criticisms passed upon the
academy and the measures taken to stop
hazing, and adds:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24.â The most Im
portant feature of the annual report of
Colonel A. L. Mills, superintendent of the
Military Academy, relates to the measures
taken for the suppression of hazing.
Treating of discipline, he says:
"What was considered the weak point in
the teachers' case was that the manda
mus was asked while the board was still
in session and while it was protesting that
it meant to do the very thing which the
mandamus required. The teachers' conten
tion was that the board was a continuing
board and that it had refused for years to
make these assessments and that If a
mandamus could not issue until after the
board had adjourned it might a.9 we't
never be Issued at all, and there was ab
solutely no way to compel the board to
perform Its manifest duty. The teachers'
view of the case seems to have been sus
tained by the Supreme Court.
Broad as Is the sweep of this decision
in its effect, its logical results are much
greater, as the decision, it is said, really
applies just as well to railroad corpora
tions and every other corporation in the
State and may lead to the collection of
back taxes.
The trial of the case was begun befora
Judge Thompson In Springfield, "March 23,
and the decision was handed down May 2.
commanding the board to reassemble June
13 and assess these corporations in accord
ance with the rules of the board In regard
to the assessment of capital stock. But
the 'board not only neglected to make the
assessment, but repealed the rules of the
board on the subject, 'which had been in
force for thirty years and had been sus
tained by the United States Supreme
Court as the only fair and . legal plan of
assessment.
The opinion quotes the order of tha
lower court, commanding the members cf
the board to convene forthwith at tha
Capitol building in the County of Sanga
mon and value and the capital
stock, including the franchises of tha
companies named in the manner provided
by law.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â The tax decision
given to-day by the Illinois Supreme Court
relates to twenty-three local corporations
enjoying municipal franchises, including
traction companies, gas companies and
electric companies, whose total capital
stock was estimated to be $368,000,000, all
of which had escaped taxation previously,
and was likely to be omitted again by tha
State board, which adjourned last Decem
ber without assessing this vast amount of
property. '
The court holds that the board In assess
ing corporations does not act as a board
of review, but as an original assessor. In
stead of making a proper assessment, the
court says that the board arbitrarily and
willfully failed to follow a proper and
long-established rule In force in this
State for making such assessments, by re
fusing to take into consideration the bond
ed indebtedness of said corporations. They
also disregarded all other rules in fores
for the making of such assessments,
sought to pass new rules for their govern
ment, refused to consider the information
furnished them by the assessors, as pro
vided by statute and assessed the company
stock and franchises of said corporations at
a nominal sum instead of at the fair cash
value hereof. For these reasons, the de
cision says, "the court is justified In hold
ing that fraud in making of such assess
ments has been established and such pre
tended assessments may be properly dis
regarded and treated as no assessment and
such board be coerced by the writ of man
damus to assess such property."
SPRINGFIELD, HI., Oct. 24.â The Su
preme Court to-day affirmed the judg
ment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon
Â«_ounty In what is . known a3 the Chicago
Teachers' Tax case. This, In effect,
awards a writ of mandamus against the
State Board of Equalization to compel it
to assess the capital stock, including fran
chises, of twenty Chicago corporations,
the fair cash value of whose capital stock,
including franchises, over and above tha
value of their tangible property is alleged
to aggregate $235,0u0,0UO.
The suit was instituted by the State's
Attorney of Sangamon County at the in
stance of the Chicago Teachers' Federa
tion.

ports that twenty cases have occurred, al

been of a mild type as compared with the
epidemic in China and Inaia, where the
plague death rate reaches 80 per cent or
mere. The Sultan has appointed a sani
tary commission of experts, whose in
structions immediately on the manifes
tation of bubonic plague are to take all
necessary preventive steps without be
ing obliged to report to any official au
thority whatever. He arraigned the Pre
fecture de la Villa for carelessness in
many steps. Including the establishment
of hospitals. The Ottoman Government,

HEART DISEASE
Some Facts Regarding the Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart troubles, at least among the
Americans, are certainly increasing, and
while this may be largely due to the ex-
citement and worry of American business
lite, it is more often the result of weak
.stomachs, of poor digestion. ' -
Real organic, disease is incurable, buf
.not one case in a hundred of heart trouble
Is organic
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nerves
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way. also the heart is af-
fected by the form of poor digestion
which causes gas and fermentation from
naif digested food. There is a feeling of
â¢oppression and heaviness in the chest
caused by pressure of the distended
Etomach on the heart and lungs, interfer-
ing with their action, hence arises pal-
pitation and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
ranking It .thin and watery, which irrl-
tr.tes and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble is to improve the digestion and to
Insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use
alter meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stuart's
.Dyspepsia Tablets, which. may be found
at most drug stores,, and which contain
valuable, harmless digestive elements in
a pleasant, convenient form.
â¢ It is safe to say that the regular, per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at meal time will cure any form of
Etomach trouble except cancer of the
stomach. ~ "â

cussion of the "disobedience of orders" dis
patch when the old clock In the courtroom
struck four and Admiral Dewey announced
an adjournment for the day, notwithstanding
that Admiral Schley told him that he. would
like to conclude his testimony at this sitting.
The admiral was calm and collected throughout
the \u25a0 two hours that he was In the witness
chair, and he spoke In tones which, while not
loud, were so distinct that his words were
easily heard, v
Again referring to his own dispatch. Admiral
Schley said that it had been delivered in Eng
lish, but, he added, "read in the light of this
order and in view of the fact that the squad
ron did not return to Key West, whatever may
have been our intention or purposes, I say there
was no disobedience . of that order, and there
is no order there ! to go back. It was simply
that the department looked to me to establish
a fact of which it was not certain."
In response to a. request of Raynor for the
exact wording of the sentence In the dispatch
In dispute. Admiral Schley gave It as- follows:
"It Is to be regretted that the department's
orders cannot be obeyed, earnestly as we have
all striven to that end."
This, he said, was the authentic version of
the sentence, and was as he sent It.
"If we ho\l gone to the place indicated," he
said, "at the time we received the dispatch
we would have been in all probability gob
bled." . 'V \u25a0 .
Admiral" Schley pointed out that the Infor
mation eent from the Navy Department as to
the whereabouts of the Cuban insurgents .in
the vicinity of Santiago was erroneous, . the
dispatch placing them much nearer that city
than they were.
No Disobedience of Orders.
"If my reply to the telegram of the Secretary
of the Navy is not on record, I- would ; like to
put It there in the terms I sent It, . because i I
wrote It In English, gave it to Captain Cotton,
asked him to turn it into cipher and confirmed
It afterward in a : letter to the department,
which was received. The dispatch is here, arid
has been in the department for nearly \u25a0 three
years. I do not believe for one. moment that in
the translation of it there . was any intention
to mutilate It, but I think, in ' the choice of
words which 5 were not ! exactly of the same
meaning, the dispatch did not get to the de
partment entirely as I intended it should.
Upon this dispatch is based the charge of dis
obedience of orders. I contend that there was
no disobedience of orders. There would have
been disobedience of orders if I had abandoned
my statlom ! but, having returned to the station
without other direction and having found that
the department's information was correct, I
hold that I did not disobey orders and I think
that this dispatch, read and Interpreted as sent,
will relieve that charce." ' ; \u25a0 .
Discussing again his dispatch to the depart
ment concerning the department's orders, the
admiral said: \u25a0 , '
"Neither my first lieutenant, neither my
flag lieutenant . nor my secretary ever saw It
or can remember It. and It Is a little : strange
that . three j persons who , had :: access to â¢\u25a0; my
papers at all times should have failed -. to ' re
member, a dispatch of that Importance.. So it
is.'a. mistake. -I;nevers*w lt.";I' do not re
member it. I have- no recollection of it, nor
of â¢ a \u25a0 good - many things which â¢ I have heard
during this Investigation.". < . .
â¢ Admiral \u25a0 Schley at this point returned to his
conversation at Clenfuegos with Captain Mc-
Calla. He exonerated the captain from' any
Intention to do him Injustice, but he said that
the captain had failed to give alloJ that con
versation. â¢ .\u25a0'-'\u25a0 â¢ .' ' . - '
"Captain Cotton said he delivered a dis-'
patch to me from Admiral Sampson stating
that they were there. ! That dispatch ' never
reached me. I never saw â¢ it. I never heard
of it until the other day. If it ever was de
livered it should have been found among my
papers, but it could not have been delivered
to me for the reason that a dispatch of that
character would have burned itself so indelibly
on my mind I never could have forgotten it,,
never. Captain Cotton did not communicate
It to me, and there I think his recollection Is
at fault and not his veracity, because I do not
believe he would state anything that was not
so. .-; â¢ \u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢ . . â v
Continuing, he said :
Dispatch Never Beached TT^m,
"Now the telegram I sent to the Hon. Sec
retary of the Navy did not refer only to the
battleship, as interpreted, \u25a0 but it referred to
the entire fleet. We had at that time ten ships
in the squadron, seven of which were short of
coal. '.there were the auxiliaries and the
Texas. The auxiliaries and the -Marblehead
and the Vixen. I think, were moderately well
filled. The amount of coal which we transmit
ted should â¢ have, I think, called attention to
that fact. Now. as has been testified to and
shown, I think almost every one who has had
any command during a war wherein- large res
ponsibilities were involved would have been
unwise not to have considered his own ac
complishments. We could not assume that the
enemy was going to chase toward our base;
It was probable he would chase toward his own.
He would have been I there pretty regularly or
among his more Intimate friends at Marti
nique. I do not think he would have been
liable to have gone to our base, and therefore
any calculation which took into consideration
the efficiency, of the squadron had to assume
that it would be in a direction least favorable
to us and most favorable to the enemy."
Admiral Schley again referred to the unman
ageable condition of the collier Merrimac, . say
ing that no prudent commander would have
sent a ship alongside of her.
Referring to the arrival of the Harvard, the
witness spoke of the ' discrepancy In the re
port as to the information which captain, now
Rear Admiral Cotton, of ' that vessel, had
brought aboard the Brooklyn. He said that the
dispatch which Captain Cotton had brought
aboard had said that the department's advices
Indicated that the Spanish fleet was at San
tiago.
"I was," he said, "thinking over in my mind
that ' a squadron, in Its ccailng endurance, . or
at least in its speeding endurance, was equal
only to its weakest members, just as the speed
of a fleet depends upon its slowest vessel ; that
it would be necessary to equalize as nearly as
we could their standards of steam in order
to be of effective use as a unit, and that de
termined the westward movement.
. In this connection Admiral Schley explained
his retrograde movement, so-called, to . the
westward, saying that "he had not considered
the economical aspect of this step, as economi
cal features coula never be taken Into consid
eration in military movements. He had,* he
said, made careful Inquiry as to the coal sup
ply of the various ships and had turned over
in his mind their endurance, in battle.

unreserved seat In the large room in the gun

called to order at 11 o'clock. The announce
ment of the approaching close of the case and
of the possibility that Admiral Schley would
take the witness stand during the, day had. the
effect of Increasing the public interest and of
bringing to the courtroom a far larger number
than could hear the proceedings.

Coming to the blockade off Cienfuegos the
admiral explained the formation of his fleet
there, saying that the steaming which had
been mentioned in the logs was for the pur
pose of overcoming the effect of a current
wheh set directly into the shore. He said the
ships were constantly settling Into the beach
and were obliged almost every hour to steam
for a mile or two. "And that." he said, "ac
counts for a good deal of what is stated in the
lojrsi about steaming."
Ir. this same connection the admiral said
that he had fixed the position of the squadron
eve-y morning and every afternoon by.; what
is known as the four point bearing.
"At night." he continued, "we had an In
variable light breeze, and we kept in a general
Circ ctlon on a general bearing. We were closer
et night, and that," he ' said emphatically,
"was the rule of the squadron always. We
â¢were closer at night at both Cienfuegos and
Santiago. The idea of keeping the squadron
in formation during the night or in line of
battle ready for any emergency was never
abandoned. The arrangement during the day
was eome little feigmed disorder. In the hope
than we might invite those people out. We
knew there would be difficulty in getting
in. because my flagship was of greater draught
than most of the others, the channels were
very tortuous, and our only hope, at least our
enly wish, was that they must come out. The
mo\/>ments of the squadron were rather an
Invitation, usually. That was what I felt dur
ing all the period of this blockade."
At this point Admiral Schley digressed for a
monent to refer to the conversation he had
with Admiral Sampson before - leaving Key
We*t. which he eaid had induced the belief
that the Spanish squadron's objective was Cien
fuefo*.
'That fact," he said, "fixed that in my
mind. A good many of the things about which
I am tetslfying burned themselves into my
memory because I was the most Interested
paity. I cannot recall anything in connection
with the Iowa at all."
Admiral Schley also said that the Iowa had
arrived to Join the fleet on the 22d, but he did
not: remember that It had brought any dii,
pat.ches beyond an envelope containing some
letters, one of which was from his (Schley's)
vrli'e.
"I did not remember the fact until within
tho past few months, because there were du
plicates of that letter, but I now recall it
from the fact that I sent the Scorpion to the
taut ward in obedience to the injunction con
tained in that letter to communicate with the
sctiuts, about whose presence off Santiago I
â¢was uncertain, as I think the admiral was on
account of orders having been eent directing
thÂ«m to proceed in the direction of the Span
ish main to look for the squadron. The ad
miral was not certain whether they had got
back, nor was I. Therefore I sent the Sc&r
picn east, and that fact fixed the receipt of
thjit letter."
At 9 o'clock on the evening of the 22d the
torpedo-boat Dupont, the admiral said, ar
rived with a dispatch from Admiral Sampson.
Tr.e dispatch referred to was the "Dear
Schley" letter. The witness said:
Dispatch. From Sampson.
â¢'I generally," he said, "gave the position
that the squadron was from the beach by the
appearance of the surf, which ordinarily Is not
Â«*<jn beyond tix miles except at a great eleva
tlco."
The admiral said that after this Inspection
of the harbor he had taken a p sltlon with
the fleet three or four miles out. '.
Admiral Bchley placed hiÂ§ arrival off Clen
fuegoa at near midnight of May II. He told
of bearing guns early that evening \u25a0while still
t'.ilrty or forty miles distant from the Cuban
port. Describing this incident, he said:
"Toward sundown cf-that afternoon I vra.%
riandin? on the bridge of the Brooklyn and
distinctly heard six or seven guns fired 'with
the cadence of a salute. The fact of hearing
tlioee runs was undoubted, bo much so that
the officer of the deck epoke of it. I happened
to be there at the time."
He said that the fleet stopped for the night
ten or twelve miles off shore off Cienfuego^;
that he had sent the Scorpion ahead of the
S'tet as a pilot, and toward daylight on the
following momln?. May 22, all the ships had
steamed In" dose to the harbor entrance.
"My recollection Is," he said, "that we wen 1 :
within a mile and looked at the harbor. But
owing to trees and other obstructions it was
Impossible to see Into the harbor. I never saw
any smokestacks, and I was a very close
wutcher on deck, penerally from 8 o'clock In the
xnsrolcg until 12 or 1 o'clock at night. There
Wiis scarcely a circumstance of any kind that
escaped me." . <
The admiral also related his meeting the
Cincinnati and the Vesuvius the next morning
Â«2 San Antonio. Captain Chester. In com
mand of the Cincinnati, came aboard the
Brooklyn remaining for about three-quarters
of an hour. He related the details of his con
versation with Captain Chester, saying that
they had '"threshed out a good many subjects.
After mentioning a number of the subject*
which fild not bear upon the present Inquiry
the admiral Â»ald that Captain Chester bad ex
pressed himself as specially desirous of joiii
ing the flying squadron with his ship, but said
that his coal supply was so limited that he
\u25a0would be compelled to go to Key West at a
very early date to replenish It. Admiral
Kchley eaid that he had terminated this part
of the conversation by saying to Captain Ches
ter that as his ship was not in his (Schley s)
(Mmmand he could not attach him to the
tquadrcn. In the same connection witness said
that Captain Chester had asked permission to
coal the Cincinnati from the flying squadron
collier, but he (Schley) had declined this prop
Â£ *Continuing his report of this conversation,
the admiral eaid:
"I then asked him If hÂ« had ever cruised In
the West Indies, es I ha4 never been on the
south side of Cuba, and if he knew of any
place that would be favorable for coaling,
t.-here fairly smooth water could be expected.
He suggested a place some thirty miles to
the eastward on a bank, cr to the southward
en another bank, coaling upon which would
tÂ« problematical and dependent upon the
state of the weather and the sea.
"I- do not," the admiral added, "recollect
last at this moment any other conversation,
except Captain Chester's disappointment that
fc* could not Join my squadron, which I
thought extremely praiseworthy."
In response to a request from Raynor. the
admiral Eaid that one of the places that had
been recommended by Captain Chester for
coaling was to the southward of Cienfuegos
In the open eea.
"I did not agree." he said, "that that would
be a rood place to coal, because conditions in
an ordinary sea would be aggravated in shoal
vater."
Meets ' Captain Chester.'
At this point the witness quoted Admlial
Sampson's order No. 6. not failing to point
out as he \u25a0went along- that in this order the
admiral had said: "After I have the situation
more In hand I will write you and give you
any Information that euggests Itself."
The first event of note on the voyage toward
Cienfuegos occurred. Admiral Schley 6aid, af
ter he had been out from Key West three or
tour hours. It was then that he met
Captain McCalla, In charge of the sub-squad
ron with the Marblehead at Its head, which
had been doing duty on the Cuban coast near
Cienfuegos, whither the commodore with his
firing squadron was bound. He related how.
in accordance with the usual custom when
a naval officer meets a superior In rank at sea.
Captain McCalla had aeked permission to pass
on. He told how McCalla had sent the Eagle
to communicate with the flying squarVvon. Ad
miral Schley also mentioned that the Scorpion
had been sent to intercept the Eagle for the
purpose of securing whatever information she
nnlght bring.
"After a little," eald he, "the Scorpion re
turned and reported through the megaphone,
I think identically as is reported In his log,
â¢B-falch was ell the information he gave us.
The Eagle afterward passed close enough to
vhe Brooklyn to hail her by the megaphone and
j-epeated that there was no news. I was on
lie quarter deck. The thing seemed to be al
most burned into my mind, but after what I
liave heard, I begin to think that maybe
:: was mistaken."
Departure of the Squadron.
The next move of the flying squadron. Ad
miral Schley said, was from Key West to Cien
fueros, and the admiral told how, as the com
mander in chief of that squadron, he had the
vessels coaled bo that at 7 or & o'clock on the
morning of May 18 all the ships of the fleet
turned their backs upon American eoll and
laid their course for the southern coast of
Cuba. This, he said, was done under the order
of the commander In chief. Admiral Sampson.
anywhere. I then went aboard my own flag
ship in order to hasten the operations of coat-
Ing. While there the Algonquin came out,
bearing an order from the Secretary of the
Na\T. through Commodore Remey, directing me
to go off Havana. I signaled the admiral to
know wnetner or not he understood that my
orders were to go oft Havana. He replied by
signal that he understood that his coming to
Key West modified my orders and that I should
be prepared to carry out the orders we had
agreed upon in the afternoon. I do not re
member whether that was on the afternoon or
In the morning, but it was before I left for
Cienfuegos."
On the morning of May 24 Captain McCalla
had arrived off Cienfuegoa with the Marblehead
and the Vixen, and the captain had, according
to Admiral Schley Immediately reported to him
on board the Brooklyn. The witness said he
then heard for the first time of the code of
signals arranged for communicating with the
insurgents at Cienfuegos.
"I was a great deal surprised," said the wit
ness, "and asked who made these arrange
ments. He said: 'I did when I was here be
fore.' I asked why It was not communicated to
me. That he did not know, of course. He was
not answerable for that. I said: 'Where are
those fellows?' He said: 'I communicated with
them when I was here last t to the west
ward somo twelve or fourteen miles, but they
are migratory and they : may or may not be
there.' I said: 'Go ahead : and . take up the
line of search and let me know.' "
The admiral then told of his sending Captain
McCalla ashore and of the latter 1 s reporting,
about 4 o'clock on the 24th. he thought that the
enemy was not at Cienfuegos, which fact he
had learned by communication with the Cubans
on shore. An hour or two had then, the wit
ness said. bÂ»en â¢ consumed In the preparation of
dispatches, including _a. dispatch to be- sent, to
Hears of Insurgents' Code.
"After we got hold of colliers which were
very much better fitted to resist shock as well
as to deliver coal rapidly, perhaps, and with
the later experience of the war I might have
coaled on days with worse weather. We had
a good many accidents about which no men
tion has been made. One of the colliers had
to go to New York absolutely smashed In. The
Merrimac herself had several holes punched
through her. and my Impression now Is that
a portion of the top works of the Sterling
was injured In some way, but we managed
with more patience to do a little better than
at first. There always was at Cienfuegos a
rolling swell and vessels with projecting spon
sons or projecting guns were always in dan
ger. I recollect once that one of the six
pounder guns of the Brooklyn was bent at an
angle of 30 degrees by coming into collision
with one of these colliers. Of course the twin
screws made it extremely dangerous to coal
except under the most favorable conditions.-
The problem presented to me at Cienfuegos to
solve â that of coalingâ has disturbed the na
vies of the world for fifty years. I know we
accomplished this reasonably well under the
circumstances."
"Of course," he said, "to risk a boat through
the surf on a coast : believed to be occupied by
the enemy must have resulted in a repetition
of Captain McCalla' s experiment. He found
that the coast waÂ« pretty well occupied. I
eaw cavalry once or twice, both to the east and
to the west of this point. They appeared for
a moment, and immediately got out of sight.
I thought that to waste ammunition upon a
solitary cavalryman was like ehootlng big
guns at sparrows, and that killing one or two
men would not affect the result. I thought
It would be better to reserve all the ammuni
tion we had for use against the squadron
which I believed to be somewhere in that sea,
and it seems to me that was, a conclusion. I
did everything that was possible during the
time we were there to maintain the blockade
that was contemplated. I did all the coaling
that was practicable or possible."
Continuing on the subject of coaling Admiral
Schley said: . \u25a0 '
Did Not Waste Ammunition.
He said that while the squadron lay off Cien
fuegos the winds were fresh and there was
quite a rolling swell to the eea. In this con
nection Admiral Schley referred to the fact
that he had not been informed that there was
any system of signals for communicating with
the Insurgents, and he said that he did not
know that there were any insurgents to the
westward of Cienfuegos. \u25a0 This fact, he said,
together with the circumstance that the Adula
had not come, that Lieutenant Souther land
had failed to communicate any Information,
and the further fact that McCalla' s squadron
had been withdrawn from the vicinity were
responsible for the delay in communicating
with the Insurgents. "r'j
Admiral Schley said that on the night of the
23d he had seen three horizontal lights to the
eastward and to the westward of the harbor
of Cienfuegoe.
"The one to the eastward," he said, "was
In the mountains and I should say ten miles
from the coast, and certainly 600 feet up; the
others to the westward, about five or six miles
in on the beach, but back of it on the high
land."
The admiral said that the Hawk arrived
about S o'clock on the morning of May 23. This
vessel, he 6ald, had brought the dispatch from
Sampson which is designated as No'.* 8. This
is the dispatch in which the commander in
chief notified the commander of - the flying
squadron that the Spanish fleet probably was
at Santiago, and directed him. "If satisfied
that they are not at Cienfuegos, to proceed
with all dispatch to Santiago."
The witness said he had received duplicate
copies of dispatch No. 8 and said he identified
the copy brought by* the Hawk as the first re
ceived by marginal notes which had been
made on the, copy. He also said that a copy
of No. 7. the "Dear Schley" letter, and also
â¢a copy of the McCalla memorandum had been
received by the Hawk, saying that these facts
were fixed In his mind by tho circumstances
that on that date a signal had been given to
the squadron notifying the vessels that there
was a rumor that Cervera's fleet was at San
tiago. "That." he said, "is fixed in my mind,
because If I had got It the day before I would
have made that signal to the squadron as my
habit was to keep them all Informed."
2To Verbal Orders From Hood.
Relating the fact of the arrival of the Cas
tine and a collier on the 23d, Admiral Schley
referred to his reported conversation with Lieu
tenant Hood, which, he said. "lÂ» one of the
other conversations I do not remember. I
think," he went 6n, "that I can show you by
a memorandum of Mr. Hood' is that if he had
any verbal orders he forgot to report them."
The admiral then referred to a memoran
dum from the Dolphin published in the appen
dix to the report of the chief of the Bureau
of Navigation, reading as follows:
"The Hawk has just reported from Cienfue
gos with dispatches from Schley. Hood says
a good number of officers don't believe the
Spaniards are there at all, although they can
only surmise." '
"That," remarked the admiral, "would? go
to Indicate that Mr. Hood was not very cer
tain in his own mind, or. If he had brought
any verbal Instructions to me, that he failed
to report the fact to the commander in chief.
Below it Is also a border information which I
6hould have been very glad to have had. Mr.
Hood got Into the anchorage, - 1 think, some
time about S o'clock. The Adula did not get
Into the anchorage at Cienfuegos before 10 or
11 o'clock. Lieutenant Hood did not board that
ship In my presence. She had already been
boarded. If he boarded her and got this news
and failed to deliver it to me then he com
mitted an indiscretion, for I was the senior
officer and he did not know what I was going
to do with her. I should have been glad to
have had his information. So that with this
note and this information I think Mr. Hood
remembered a good deal of what he said to
me, but be forgot a good deal that he should
have done."
Blockade at Cienfuegos.
Admiral Schley gave further details concern-
Ing the blockade at Cienfuegos, telling how
he had observed men laying mines across the
river and how he had established a picket
line inside the main line of blockade. Ho
'again referred to the' arrival of the Dupont,
which, he eaid, was very short of coal, having,
as was reported, only live or six tons aboard.
He. also told of the difficulties- experienced In
putting a lew additional tons aboard the tor
pedo-boat, and In this connection said: - â¢<;- '
"The work struck me as being one of such
difficulty that any attempt to coal a larger
vessel by boats would not only be exhausting
and latlgulng, but almost impossible beyond a
day or two."
'l he incident of the arrival of ! the ' British.
ship Adula was related in much detail, the ad
miral telling how he had had her boarded and
how she had brought Information in the shape
of a war bulletin which had stated that me
Spanish fleet had arrived at Santiago on May
Is; and had left there on the following day.
Remarking upon the report contained in this
bulletin the admiral said: ,
"That, of course, taken with the manner of
my approach and the distance being about
thirty-six to forty-eight hours away, lent color
to the belief that I entertained."
The admiral then related how the commander
of the Adula had been allowed upon specious
premises to - go into the harbor and had not
come out on the following day as he had
promised to do.
"I think he did me injustice when he spoke
of my speaking disrespectfully of Admiral
Sampson. I used no such term. There was no
reason why I should have done so. I Invaria
bly spoke of him as Admiral Sampson, and I
do not recollect one word of the conversation
which Lieutenant Wood recitedâ not one word,
and I recollect a good many things pretty well,
I am glad to say, and very little from Imagin
ation."
the visit of Lieutenant Wood of the Dupont
to him on board the Brooklyn, when the Du
pont arrived oil Cienfuegos. He said that
Lieutenant Wood was In a pitiable condition ot
exhaustion because of his arduous duties on a
torpedo boat. "I told him," said the admiral,
"that if I were a King I would promote every
torpedo officer five, grades if I could."
Continuing, the admiral related ho\y Lieuten
ant Wood had handed him the dispatch and
added: -â¢
the Secretary of the Navy, ana about 6 o'xlock
the squadron steamed to the south.
"I think," he said, "that we finally got under
way between 7 and 8 o'clock on a course of
about southeast. . The orders to the squadron
were by signal. I did not care whether the
enemy saw them or not. I am quite sure that
the distance which we had steamed from the
preliminary formation until the final depart
ure was outside of any distance they could have
been read or seen from shore.". â¢:\u25a0*.'\u25a0-;
. Speaking of the weather condition on the
night of the 24th, after . the squadron had got
under way, the admiral said that he remem
bered that the night wa6 a dirty one and the
sky lowering. It was rainy in squalls, he said.
He recalled especially that he had looked out
through a porthole twenty feet above water
and that the spray dashed in.
"Of course," he said, "weather, of that sort
did not mean much to the larger ships, but to
the smaller ones it did."
Giving the formation of the squadron he said
that he had kept the collier on his weather
side, so tha* in case the enemy should appear
that vessel could be protected or sunk. The
arrangement also had contemplated that the
Marblehead would be able, with the two
smaller vessels, to act as torpedo-boat destroy
ers. He said his policy had been to keep the
squadron together as a unit, and added:
Formation as a Unit.
"I think it will be admitted in changing the
location of a squadron from one port- to an
other that it would be unmllltary and unwise
to proceed in any other formation than as a
unit. My impression is that useful auxiliaries
and necessary supplies never should be aban
doned except under the very strictest military
necessity."
Adihiral Schley spoke pf the weather on the
25th as rough for the smaller ships.
"I remember," he said, "that the Marble
head carried away one of her booms that was
alongside on account of the sea. The Vixen
took green seas over her bows and badly in
jured a man. The Eagle filled one of her for
ward compartments. Both of these ships con
stantly dropped astern. The squadron, of
course, slowed for them. On several occasions
the Merrimac signaled the disarrangement of
her steering gear and of. her engines, necessi
tating stops. Coaling on the 25th would have
been absolutely Impossible. I watched the sea
perhaps more carefully than any -one else and
was ready to avail of the earliest oportunlty
to take advantage of It. and I felt that I
was very much more capable and very much
more competent than any one else in the
squadron of judging when coaling \u25a0 was pos
sible."
Coming to the 2Cth Admiral Schley said that
the weather was still rough, and he related
the Incident of sending Commander Souther
land away with the Eagle.
"He did not," the admiral said, "insist upon
coaling his ship, because it would have been
absurd; it was impossible. His ship at the
time was laboring a great deal, slashing and
rolling about. He regretted having to leave
the squadron for coal as well as myself. His
contention, however, "that he could coal on
that occasion was utterly untenable. He could
have coaled. I suppose, in boats, but he would
have burned the coal as fast as he got it on
board. \u25a0-:...\u25a0..
"We continued In an \u25a0 easterly course." said
the admiral, again taking up the thread of
his narrative, "as my orders contemplated ap
proaching cautiously and as they also con
veyed to me the information that probably
when I left Cienfuegos the enemy would leave
Santiago I laid such a course as I thought
would give me a wide horizon, and if he did
leave I could not Imagine he would try . to
pass inside of me. I estimated, of course, he
would pass to the southward. My course , as
projected would have, of course, gone to China
If there had been no islands In the way." - \u25a0
The admiral then ' told how, upon reaching
a point southward from Santiago, about 4 or
5 o'clock in the afternoon of May 26, he had
encountered the scout boats- St.- Paul. Minne
apolis and Yale, but before relating the details
of coming up with them he' digressed sufficient
ly to refer to a dispatch in which he had men
tioned his intention of delaying until the 2oth
his. departure from Cienfuegos which, he ex
plained, was for the purpose of taking up the
Scorpion, which vessel had been expected i back
on the 24th or 25th.
"That," he said, ".'was the suggestion, but
we can make a great many: suggestions and
say a gocd many things and then we are priv
ileged net to follow, them." > â¢ â¢ .
Admiral Defends His Course. â¢
At this point the admiral entered upon an
other defense of his course by saying:
"I was on the south side of Cuba, of course
invested. I thought, with entire responsibility.
I was not In communication by telegraph. I
did not know that we \u25a0 had secret' agents' in
Havana. I did not know that there was any
means of communicating with the insurgents.
If that were known, I should have known it
also because I was acting in an entirely In
dependent capacity, I may almost say. I
could not be reached by telegrams and a good
deal I did had to be left to guessing. And
some times I guessed right and sometimes 1
guessed wrong, and I suppose in the light of
recent events we are all liable to do that."
The witness then referred to his picking up
the scout boats. In this connection he again
spoke of the weather conditions on the voy
age from Cienfuegos over, saying that Captain
Cook reported that he had never seen more
motion on the Brooklyn, and that some of the
youngsters in the steerage were seasick, which
is an unusual thing.
He then related the Incident of Captain Sigs
bee's coming aboard the Brooklyn from the
St. Paul, saying that the visit had impressed
itself vividly upon his mind.
'I recollect distinctly," he said, "that he had
on ' rubber boots and an old blockading cap,
which we all wore more or less, and an ordi
nary blouse suit."
The admiral then proceeded to give the In
formation which Captain Sigsbee had brought
prefacing what he had to say with the state
ment that he did not believe Captain Sigsbee
would misstate anything for his commission.
'.'I don't believe." the admiral said, "that
he is capable of stating what is not true. .In
this instance I think his recollection is at
fault and not his veracity. I. said to him:
â¢Captain, have you got the Dons here?" He
said to me: 'No, they are not in here. I have
been in very close.' I don't know but what
he said 'sketching,' but he certainly said:
'They are not here; they are only reported
here.' I said to him: 'Have any t of the other
vessels sÂ«en them, the Yale or the Massachu
setts?' He said: 'No, they have not. They
have assured me so." That was the assurance
to which I referred when I spoke of the assur
ance of such men as Wise and Jewell -and
Sigsbee. I do not believe that any of theism
men would misstate the conditions at all, but
I assured them i from the communication from
Sigsbee that he was bearing to me the as
surances of all of them."
Relating his interview with Pilot Eduardo
Nunez, Admiral Schley said that Nunez had
expreessd the opinion that it would have been
almost impossible for ships of the size of
those of the Spanish fleet to enter the Santt
ago harbor, the pilot saying that the entrance
was not only shallow but tortuous. . ..
Assumes the Responsibility.
Referring in a general way to Captain Slgs
bee's visit. Admiral Schley said:
"My habit of life, not only In point of com
mand of a squadron, but also in command of a
ship, was to assume the responsibility and the
danger of censure of any movement that might
Justify it. but I was never willing under any
circumstances to be a participant in glories 1
would not divide^. That was the general prin
ciple upon which* I acted In this matter. . I did
not call any council of war. The Information
which these people gave me led , me to infer
that the .telesrraphlc information was a ruse
precisely similar to- that .which was- 1 tele
graphed from Cadiz that the squadron had re
turned from the Cape Verde Islands. That
would have been my policy if I had been in
control, and if any of us â¢ at any time made
any mistakes during the campaign of Santiago
or elsewhere, it was in supposing that the
Spaniards would ever do right at the right time.
That probably was the only reason we made any
mistakes that we did make. I determined that,
that being ' the case, a move - eastward would
be unwise. In that I knew Admiral Sampson
would have moved 10 the eastward of Havana.
It would not have been wise for me to have
uncovered Santiago. .The military Importance
of that movement would have been to guard
the westward, as that would have been \u25a0 the
only place they could have got in behind. As
those in 'the interior had an absolute control
of the entire line, our movements every minute
of the day were known -in Havana, and I have
often been surprised that Cervera did not leave
Santiago when I left Cienfuegos. I found out
afterward Â« why he did ' not ; do " itâ simply be
cnuse he could > not â and therefore v we â¢ did not
suffer any." . ' . .\u25a0"\u25a0\u25a0
Relating the particulars of the breaking down
of the collier Merrimac on the evening , of the
26th, Admiral Schley said: that his first deter- 1
mlnation had been to have her towed to Key
West by , the Yale, as ; he. did not ; consider It
desirable to have an unmanageable collier with
him.- 'â¢ â¢. .:'..' â¢â¢--.-.. â¢;\u25a0 â¢\u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0 - ":' ;-.i
- "It then occurred â¢ to- me." "he said, ."that
if we did send her to Key West with the Yale
celve- the surrender of that ship. She had
hauled down her flag and was ashore. The offi
cers and many of the men. were gathered for
ward In the neighborhood of the forecastle and
Commodore Schley addressed the men, caution
ing -them 'not to -cheer when the -Spanish, cap
tain came 'on .: board. .. He spoke of their gal
lantry, sayirfg that they had made a good fight
and that they, should not be humiliated; that
we should treat- them chivalrously and not hu
miliate them ; by cheering. It was a gallant
speech, and we- all felt -it very deeply. . The
commodore made the same speech about mid
night of the same day, when we were ranging
alongside the Iowa, and we had learned that
Admiral Cervera and his officers were. on board
that ship. It afterward developed that Ad
miral Cervera heard Commodore Schley make
the remark and he appreciated Jt very much,
so we were told."
Brooklyn Target of the Enemy.
Describing the course of the Brooklyn during
the battle of July 3, Commander. Harlow tes
tified: -,;\u25a0
"I saw the Brooklyn receiving almost the en-
did as he progressed, and he was soon distinctly
heard In the vicinity of the court.
Dsscri-Dtion of the Battle.
At the request of Raynor, he began a descrip
tion of the battle of July 3. as follows:
"When we discovered the Spanish ships corn
ins out, our fleet closed in at once. to attach
them, each ship being- ordered to keep lief
head directly toward the harbor entrance.
The Spaniards turned to the westward, break
in? through cur line and crossing it. and our
ships swung oft to the westward in pursuit.
Both sides opened flre promptly and flred rap-
Idly. ' Dense smoke obscured the vessels, malt
ins it difficult to dt3tir.gulsh them.
"The Oregon ran between the Iowa and thÂ«
Texas and the next ships to the westward . in
our line, and soon after we sighted four Span'
lsh ships ahead, apparently uninjured, at that
time. They had Rained so much ground that
I believed they had been successful In at
tempting to escape, but it was soon evident
we were gaining at least on- one of them,
which afterward proved to be the Maria Ter
esa, the flagship, and I thought we should
bring her to close action, but might be ex
posed to the concentrated flre of all the ships.
Just then the smoke lifted or broke away
to the left, and I discovered the Brooklyn.
She was well forward of our port beam and
tire flre of the two leading ships with an oc
casional shot from the Colon.- I was in a po
sition to see a flash, and shortly, afterward the
fall of the projectile, and these showed that a
large proportion, was. about the Brooklyn. The
Colon evidently was using smokeless powder,
and I . was not able to tell so well where her
shots fell."' \u25a0:'\u25a0\u25a0'<: ;\u25a0,â '\u25a0
The witness said be was satisfied " that the
fire of the Brooklyn set the Viacaya on flre
and caused her to run ashore. There was no
other American ship within range of the Vls
caya at that time. The Maria Teresa was
driven ashore by the concentrated .fire of all
the ships of the American fleet The Oquencto
was bo far In the rear he could not estimate
what vessels caused her destruction. In re
sponse to a question by the court, Commander
Harlow said that the Vixen was able to main
tain the standard speed of nine knots an hour
with the fleet In the voyage from Cienfuegos
to Santiago. He also said in response, to a
question by the court that with searchlights
the ' Vixen was near enough to the mouth of
the harbor at Santiago to see the enemy's
ship3 in case of an effort to escape.
The large audience manifested signs of in
terest as the captain of the Oregon approached
the witness stand. Admiral Dewey smiled as
he walked around to the end of the table to
administer the oath. Captain Clark at first

Our Nine Dollar Sack Suits
The continued demand for our $9 suits proves that they are meeting with marked ap-
proval. The suits actually sell themselves. A customer comes in., looks over the variety of
patterns, selects something to his liking and the sale is made. This .can only be done when
clofhes have a good outward appearance.
We will vouch for the "inside" of these suits â for the making and material, on which
the wear depends. We know that they are all wool and well made by union labor, that the
color is fast, that the suits are worthy : the price. Should a customer disagree with our opin-
ions he can have his money back. Need we say more of our faith, in the suits?
\u25a0 They are made in solid colors and fancy patterns from cheviots, tweeds, worsteds and
serges. A new shipment of these goods has just arrived from our workshops.

opening stanzas run: Z'.'.'-'\?
Come, all you men who mush for goldâ you men
who break the trailâ â¢\u25a0 . .
And listen, while I fabricate a weird; eventful
tale.
i Of Judge Noyes Dunham had much to
eajr. His claims on the Topkuk were rich
â¢with r gx>ld.' He was the original' locator.
Then they were "jumped" and the lawyer
entered into the view of things and Dun
ham Is still in the throes of legal battle.
Into verse and so successful was this
poem that its author had fastened upon
him the title of "The Nome Poet"
Now I advise you men who mush â you men
who dig for gold:
When you have found and staked a claim you
feel inclined to hold,
Don't mush 'to town and tell your friends, nor
let the lawyers know.
But camp rig-ht there with loaded guns and
give yourselves a show.
Attorneys "Wrangle.
Bo much for Dunham, whose tale on the
stand Is given below. Serious allegations
were made by him, as well as by Judge
Johnson and Samuel Knight in the dispo
sition of gold held by the receivers of tho
Topkuk claims. Amicus Curiae Pillsbury
has threshed out pretty much all there U
in the case and will conclude his work for
the Government before the day is over.
The first line of yesterday's testimony
was educed to show the knowledge on the
part of Judge Noyes that the legislative
act of June 6, 1900, allowed an appeal to
be taken from an order of receivership
issued by a district court. Then the Top
kuk litigation and the receivership iniq
uities were again exposed to view.
As the examination dragged its weary
length the attorneys grew more and more
acrid and at the closing hour Heney and
Pillsbury clashed swords in earnest. This
came so hard upon the smooth, gentle
entre vous talk between Metson and Mc-
Laughlin that it struck the courtroom like
several kinds of lightning. Heney said to
Pillsbury in regard to certain testimony:
Is this for the newspapers?"
Said Pillsbury to Heney: " You seem
to have newspapers on the brain."
"Yes, sir, I have them on the brain from
listening to your examination and it's a
good thing I have a brain to have them on
as I shall need it further on in this exam
ination."
Pillsbury was satisfied to end It then and
there and Commissioner Heacock, over
come with the torrid atmosphere,' dis
missed bailiff, witness and all- for the day.
Johnson on N"oyes.
Frank D. MoYickton, Clerk of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, was put upon the stand
when the court opened to testify to corre
spondence with Attorney Gunn of Nome.
Monckton met Gunn and Jim Gaylen In
Seattle; Gurtn argued in the Circuit Court
of Appeals that the order should be set
aside.
Judge C. S. Johnson was next called
He was attorney for the defendants In
the Chips vs. LInderberg case. The ami
cus curiae began:
"Mr. Metson spoke of an interview held
on July 24, 1900, with McKenzie concern-
Ing the Anvil Creek property,"
"I learned for the first time that Me-
Kenzle was appointed receiver on July
23, said the witness. "Johnson went to
Judge Noyes' room to ascertain If a re
ceiver had been appointed. He met
Dickey there and found the papers in the
Chips caseâ a complaint and affidavitâ on
the desk. "The papers showed no filing
and he called Dickey's attention to it- 'I
Just received these a few minutes ago,'
? a iÂ£Â» DickÂ£ ar- I think he filed them later.
i. did not see bonds among the papers."
. Johnson learned on Saturday, July 21
that Judge Noyes came ashore. On Mon
day he called on him and asked him when
the court would be open for business, and
the Judge said as soon as he returned
from St. Michael. Then the old story of
the two orders issued by Judge ; Noyes
concerning \ the Discovery claim property
and the working materials of the miners
was threshed over. When Johnson asked
of the court for an order allowing an ap
peal from the order appointing McKenzie.
Judge Noyes said it was a settled matter
now and McKenzie would remain re
ceiver.
Light Hand of McKenzie.
Johnson, In a conversation with Noyes
in his rooms, told some pretty plain facts
about how McKenzie. had promised for a
third interest in certain. Topkuk claims a
favorable judgment from the court. JudjrÂ»
Noyes said to Johnson: . \u25a0 â¢ " -
"Well, I can't let you prove, this; I
can't let 1 you expose this or reflect urÂ»on
the court." ' y '
Tho witness said he certainly would ask
for an order to protect his client, and then
left Judge Noyes.
In a conversation later on with Judtre
Noyes the latter said to Johnson:
"I'm coin* to see If Judge Robs is eo-
Ing to block this court all the time. We
might as well have It out now. Anyway
tho cases are tried by the press in Sari
Francisco."
The bond question came up again and
Judge Johnson r testified > that, although
frequent applications were made: to raise
tho bonds In the Topkuk claims cases, the
court would never, allow it.*;u ..
On another tack, Judge Johnson said:
"Our. people were- not allowed at > all
times to be present at the clean-ups. Ap
plication was made to tho court, but noth
ing came of it." ...
These Topkuk claim. cases and the'liti
gation concerning them exposed many ec
centricities In the meting, out of . Justice
by Judge Noyea. ,The line of testimony
recited by Judge Johnson went to show
TWO LEGAL. LIGHTS AND CHIEF
WITNESS IN THE NOME CON
TEMPT HEARING YESTERDAY.
Tale of Poet Dunham.
Sam Dunham, special agent in the cen
sus office in Alasica, was next called to
the stand. He was the original locator of
ihe four beach claims of the Topkuk
properties.
"Did you have any conversation with
Judge Moyes?" said Pillsbury.
"When Judge Noyes arrived," an
swered Dunham, "I saw him to seek ad
vice on having the jumpers removed from
the Topkuk mines. Four of the locators
banded in a -company* and we had tho
Jumpers removed through military pro
cess. When these guards were removed
the jumpers came back, on the claims.
That was the condition of affairs when
Judge Noyes arrived.
"Captain Hansen, who had . Keokuk
claims," and myself went to see Judge
Noyes at his rooms. Wt> met Archia
Wheeler, his private secretary. ! Wheeler
said if we gave him a half-Interest he
would see that things would be righted in
a day. I told him a fee of $1500 would bd
enough, as these men were trespassers.
Wheeler afterward said, when he had re
turned from the other, room, where he
had gone for a few minutes, that we
should divide the property in ten parts.
We then went out."
"Did you see any contract In .this case
\u25a0after that?'.'... . .:,.\u25a0\u25a0>\u25a0 ,-..;. ; '\u25a0-,
."I saw. a-pencll draft -between' Captain
Hansen 'and Archie Whe.eler. It was 'a
contract between the* Black Sheep Mining
Company and Mr^'TWheeler for a one
eighth interest, Wheeler to act as attor
ney." : -\u25a0\u25a0...\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0â¢;.-;\u25a0-\u25a0:'-\u25a0â¢ :.-"\u25a0 ".'â¢\u25a0\u25a0 :\u25a0-.-â¢. "
The witness continued to recite facts
of the claim-jumping. â¢ \u25a0
1 At this point Attorney -Keney wanted
to know â¢ the . direction of Pillsbury"s
steering, and' he soon found out. The
amicus curiae replied:
"We will show that McKenzie became
interested in the property, secured the r3
celvershlp for Cameron and, through Mc-
Kenzie, Judge Noyes, Stevens and Archie
Wheeler, worked the conspiracy.
Here the morning session ended, and
Sam C. Dunham, claim locator, poet and
census agent, went to lunch. He opened
the afternoon session.
Pillsbury States His Theory. \
Dunham then told of his mines and the
outputs. He said:
"The referee in his report said that 20,-.
000 square feet were worked and that it
averaged $5 a square foot. We were never
allowed to watch the clean-ups. The re
ceiver said so long as representatives of
jumpers were not present we could not
have one. We never could flnd out just
how much was taken out in the clean
ups." . :
"Was this claim worked in a miner
like manner?" said Pillsbury.
"It was not."
Then followed an objection from Mc-
Laughlln, which provoked the following
from Pillsbury:
."My theory is* that McKenzie used Judge
Noyes as an instrument .to carry out his
purpose. .1 believe -he was. appointed on
July 23. When the facts came before
Judge Noyes he suppressed them. My
theory is that he acted deliberately to
obstruct the course of justice, and the
Topkuk business illustrates it."
Further argument : followed \u25a0 and then
McLaughlln took the witness.
â¢;You published something in regard to
the transactions at Nome, did you not,
and they are now on record at Washing
ton?"
"Yes, sir," said Dunham. \u25a0 â¢
â¢'That's all," was McLaughlln's end to
this cross-examination. â¢ >\u25a0â¢/%
Samuel Knight was called back to the
witness chair. Attorney Pillsbury ques
tioned Knight as to his knowledge of the
act, of June 6, WOO, which made the ap
pointment of a receivership by a district
court an appealable order. It was the in
tention of the amicus curiae to show that
Judge Noyes knew of this law before the
writs of supersedeas arrived and during
those times | when the court refused apr
pealstobe taken from his orders of re
ceiverships.
"Did you get your property all back
from ..the receiver?" was the next ques
tion. -
"We were short just $9000, which we
did not receive until. after McKenzie was
arrested," responded Knight. < â¢ â¢ -
In reference to the Geary contempt,
the amicus curiae offered the testimony of
Thomas Geary, taken in the McKenzie
contempt case. There was no objection.*
John A. Lekeley. and John F. Mercer
two witnesses who were- subpenaed, had
not yet arrived and Pillsbury offered two
affidavits, but the attorneys -for the re
pondents objected. The affidavits went in
Just the same.
\ Metson and the Orders.
As the respondents' attorneys had not
finished with William H. Metson, he was
placed upon the stand for further cross
examination. The first question J asked
was in respect to the two orders found by
Metson not to have been filed and Mc-
Laughlln wanted to know if 'similar or
ders had not been filed in the other cases.
Metson said he did not know. ,
The cross-examination concluded with
an. inquiry into Metson's state of feeling
toward Judge Noyes. .',...â¢.
"Mr. Metson," is it not true you have
taken a great deal of interest in the prose
cution of Judge , Noyes?" queried. Mc-
Laughlln.
"Yes, sir;" was the positive 1 reply. \
.".Your feelings for Judge Noyes are far
front^frlendly?!' â¢
"They are." /.:,>:
"Have you spent much money in this
case, I don t mean in a legitimate way,
Mr. Metson? was softly, tenderly asked
by McLaughlin. \u25a0
. "No, Blr; I have not,", came from-Met
son. \u25a0\u25a0 \u2666 -:-\u25a0.-,
\u25a0 In the re-examinatlon Metson testified
that before the trouble in Nome he and
Judge Noyes were on such social terms
as lawyer and court ordinarily are in a
community like Nome and that he had
even asked Judge Noyes to dinner with
others. :. , .
"What did Judge- Noyes do about the
pe n J â¢ arkln ss on the orders when you

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.'
TV., "WASHINGTON, Oct. 24.â Lieutenant
General Miles has again reversed his
-views and in his annual report he will dis
cuss the anti-canteen law and oppose any
effort to repeal it. Miles has been. in
the past one of the strongest advocates of
the canteen system, and- he was largely re
sponsible for its adoption. He has
changed his ground since the anti-canteen
law was adopted and now argues that the
army is better oft without the canteen. It
is said the general hoped to raise another
issue with the Secretary of War, but he
will fall. The War Department opposed
the anti-canteen law, but when It was
adopted it proceeded to enforce It. The
only, reference to the anti-canteen law
made by Adjutant General Corbin in his
report is that -"the provision of the act of
Congress which proiaibits the sale of
beer, etc., has been carried into effect."
Secretary Root will, it is said, make no
extensive discussion of the question. The
Secretary of War regards his office as an
executive one and having carried into ef
fect the law of Congress abolishing the
canteen he will leave tho question of re
sults to Congress without comment from
himself. Miles may now denounce : the
canteen, which he was in a measure re
sponsible for, but he will not by so doing
raise an issue with the Secretary of War.
that William D. Cameron was appointed
receiver at the Instigation of McKenzie
and M. L. McCormaclc, who was the su
perintendent of the mines really, acted in
that capacity during Cameron's absence.
_ The- Topkuk mines yielded much gold.
So far the term of the receivership shows
an output of $26,000, but the attorneys for
the original locators think some $100,000 or
$1dO,000 in. cold has been extracted' from
the mine.

TWO mall steamships of the Oce
anic line sailed yesterday. The
Australia got away for Tahiti at
10:30 a. m., while the Sonoma for
Australasia did not sail uatil 2:30
p. m. The latter vessel was to have left
at 10 a. m., but owing to a delay in the
arrival of the British mail it was nearly
five hours later before she got away.
The Australia took away quite a large
caigo and the following passengers: S.
E. R. de Smidt, John Brander, D. At
vater. M. Kurka, I. E. Thayer, Captain
Porter. H. Walker, Rgv. Father B. Hons
siy, R. T. Rolp and M. Graff e.
Mr. Thayer is the South Sea represen
tative of the Bureau Veritas. while Cap
tain Porter is well known In wrecking cir
e'es. From Papeete they will go to Man
ga. Reva and attempt to get the British
ship Pyrenees out of the reef-bound har
bor in which she was run ashore.
The Pyrenees left San Francisco with a
cjirgo of wheat for Europe. When three
weeks out the grain was found to be
heated. The captain headed for Pitcalrn,
but found no place there on which he
could beach his vessel. A pilot was se
cured from among the descendants of the
mutineers of the Bounty, however, and
the burning vessel was sailed for the So
ciety group. She was beached at Manga
Reva and later the captain and crew
cEiue to San Francisco. The wreck was
scld here, but the owners would not con
firm the sale, and Captain Thayer and his
associates are now going to try to float
the vessel.
Nicholas Island at the only point where
there is a shelving beach. The crew re
fused to remain with the vessel and went
with the captain to San Pedro, where
they spread the news of the derelict. ,
A wrecking crew was at once formed
in San Pedro and when Captain Griff and
his men arrived on the steam schooner
Acme they found the wreckers in posses
sion. Captain Griff went back to San Pe
dro and telegraphed the situation to the
owners, with the that the Samoa
will tow the vessel off and leave the ques
tion of salvage to arbitration. The Lc#
Gironde is one of the best known schoon
ers that comes to this port.

A determined effort is being made in a New York
court to break the will of Millionaire Cruger on the
ground that he was insane. The most conclusive evi
dence of his insanity yet produced is that he drank
absinthe. . ;
Some' Chicago'enthusiasts- have decided to provide
homes for the stray and tramp cats and dogs of the
city. There appears to be absolutely nothing to de
termine the limit of nonsense to which residents of
the Windy City will go. '"â¢; '} .
Despite the fact that the opposition is too weak to
put up a fight the Republicans^ oMowa are making
a lively canvass. It is evidently their intention that v
the walkover shall not bV anything less dignified than
a triumphal procession with the flags Jying and the
bands playing.
One of the amusing things of the time is the effort
now being made by the free traders to distort Mc-
Kinley's last speech into a declaration against the pol
icy of protection to American industry. As an exhi
bition of gall it beats the attempts of. the Bryanites
to represent Lincoln as a supporter of Bryanism.
It attacked and insulted and suggested the murder
of President McKinley because of the policy of his
administration. Now that President Roosevelt, is
carrying out that exact policy to the letter, why, if
it were right before in cartooning Vice President
Roosevelt as a grinning effigy and utterer of non
sense, docs it not continue to do so? The Examiner
is very illogically justifying itself in doing what' it
dare not continue to do, and the intended praise it
gets from "The Gizzard," "Guzzle" and "Hee Haw"
is of no value whatever as an indorsement of a course
that it has been compelled to abandon.
Naturally it expects to resume its old ways at the
old stand, when its scare is over, but at present it
has seen a ghost just as it blasphemed, and it will
not dare swear again for a long time. â¢
But Mr. Hearst cannot vicariously plead what hap
pened in a campaign as justification of what he did
after the campaign was oxter. Nor will such plea,
though cunningly made, deceive the people who have
determined that his style of journalism shall receive
no further encouragement.
There is no offset in the practice of the Republican
press to the Examiner's cartoons of the President as
a 'negro minstrel, as the weak tool of robbers, as a
pupil of Fagin, as the enemy and hater of the. com
mon people. Nor is there any such offset to the.Ex
aminer's indorsement of the assassination of .rulers
and Presidents, and its almost daily suggestion that
the murder of President McKinley would beneficially
change history.
Of course that paper relies on the brevity of mem
ory, but that its reliance is not very strong is shown
by its ceasing to print the line of insulting pictures
which it had prepared. If it were doing right in its
own estimation and in that of its defenders,
"The Gizzard," "Guzzle" and ."Hee Haw" organs
of obscurity, why does it not continue the course out
of which it was kicked by the country's indignation?
IT would be amusing if it were not, after a sort,
pitiful to see the Examiner's daily and painful
plea of justification in its anarchical assaults on
President McKinley. The Hearst papers having been
repudiated by the reputable press and people of the
United Slates, the Examiner hails with delight any
comfort that it can get from the most obscure press.
Sq- it daily prints its own praises from the "Weekly
Gizzard," the "Lone Canyon Guzzle" and "Dry Creek
Hce Haw." These sheets generally hark back to
what Republican papers said about Mr. Bryan when
he was a candidate to justify Hearst's persistent in
sults of William McKinley after he was President and
the campaign was over. In 1896 and in 1900" the
campaign cartoons of the Republican and Democratic
press were fair offsets. No one objects to exhibiting
them side by side as samples of party zeal and Amer
ican campaign enthusiasm, or even of partisan, bad
taste.

THE American Cattle-Growers' Association held
its convention in Denver last March and at
tended to many important things which concern
the cattle-growers of the country. Among these was
provision for the drafting of a bill to protect the pub
lic range from further destruction by leasing it, under
proper restrictions, to the stock men who are now
destroying it by using it in common. The National
Livestock Association-was already committed to this
policy by its action at Fort Worth, which its conven
tion at Salt Lake last January refused to change or
disturb. This leasehold protection of the range is the
most important question now before \u25a0 the livestock
men of the country, and its importance, to meat con
sumers and the public is hardly less. .......
Apparently the Livestock Association regards this
policy as practically assured, and in its next meeting,
which will be held in Chicago on December 3, will
address itself to other interesting subjects. ' Among
these is a Federal inspection and tagging of woolen
goods so as. to identify pure wool from shoddy, and
admixtures. The grazing of forest reservations will
be discussed, and we hope decided adversely to such
injurious use of the water sources of the arid region.
The existence and eradication of poisonous plants on
the ranges will be discussed. The convention might
well consider also â¢ non-poisonous plants which
threaten to occupy the range, to the exclusion of
forage plants of greater value. The Russian thistle
has already invaded the Colorado range. Some oats
were brought from Dakota to feed mules working on
an irrigation ditch in Eastern Colorado. The oats
were mixed. with thistle seed, and that plant is now
traveling rapidly to Southern Colorado, and when, it
reaches the line of the Santa Fe Railway its transmis
sion to- California will be rapid. Stock men disagree
as to its economic value on the range. : Cattle eat.lt
readily, but we believe its food value has not been
carefully compared with that of the plants it dis
places. There is.no difference of opinion about its
injury to agriculture, and its invasion of the rich bot
tom lands of the Arkansas River at Rocky Ford and
La Junta is rousing the most painful anxiety. among
the farmers.
The convention will also ask for an annual Federal
census of livestock, the result to be compiled and
published within ninety days by. the, Department of
Agriculture. This is intended to do for the livestock
industry what the department crop report does for the
agriculture of the country. A second Assistant Sec-.

Two years ago at about this time of the year Sir
Redvers Buller was for a while. the pride and boast
of the British people. He was proudly pointed to as
the typical British officer. The stories of his martial
youth were told, and the prediction was made that he
would return from South Africa with victory and get
a peerage. In his leave-taking of the Queen he told
her the war would be troublesome but it' would not
be long. He announced a little later that he would
take his Christmas dinner in Pretoria. All that was
only "two years ago. Now another Christmas is ap
proaching. The good Queen is dead. The war goes
on and Buller disappears beneath the waters of
oblivion, shipwrecked by a squall so petty that no one
knows what caused it.
PERHAPS the world will never learn the secret
causes that led up to the dismissal of Sir Red
vers Buller from the British army. The expla
nation thus far furnished is hardly .sufficient to sat
isfy the public mind. It is but a short time since the
general was appointed to command one of the corps
of the reorganized army. The appointment gave'rise
to a great deal of discontent, but it was taken as a
proof that Buller's conduct during the time. of his
command in South Africa was approved by the War
Office. Then the general made a speech in which' he
admitted having advised the surrender of Ladysmith.
Straightway there arose a clamor, and out of the up
roar has come the announcement that Buller is dis
missed. He was given a chance to resign, but refused
to do so. .He preferred to die fighting, as it were,
and goes out under the condemnation of the very
men who) but a short time ago honored him with
high command. ' <
The British War Office must have knownthat Bul
ler had advised the surrender of, Ladysmith. It is
hardly credible that so important a message from the
commander, of the relieving army to the commander
of the besieged force could have been kept secret
from the military authorities. Consequently the only
thing in his speech that could have startled the War
Office was the publicity given to. the truth. He is
dismissed, therefore, not for what he did or left un
done, but for what he said. It was a case of talking
too much.
"It is just" at this point that curiosity arises." Why
should a general who is deemed worthy to command
one of the corps of the army be dismissed for a mere
indiscretion of speech? With such : a question to an
swer it is not strange that rumor should be busy with
conjecture. One story already, telegraphed from
Â£,ondon is to the effect that Buller falls a victim to
"petticoat politics." It is said that Lady Roberts has
been for.a long time camped on ( his trail, and that she
at last has been" able to make Lord" Roberts demand
his dismissal. That story does not appeal very
strongly to reasonable people, but until a better
theory is advanced it will doubtless be made to serve
with the gossips as an, explanation of the collapse of
Buller. " . . ' x .

SUPERNACULUMâ Subscriber. City.
Supernaculum Is Latin for. "upon tho
nail" and means that the wine Is so good
that the drinker leaves only enough In his
glass to make a bead on his nail. The
French say of first-class wine "Fait rubia
sur l'ongle" (It Is fit to make a ruby on
the nail), referring to the residue which
is only sufficient to make a drop on the
nail. Tom Nash says: "After a man has
drunk his glass it -Is usual in the North
to turn the glass upside down and let a
drop fall on the thumb nail. If tho drop
rolls off the drinker Is obliged to fill up
and drink again."
TOMATOâ Subscriber, City. A decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States
has fixed the status of the tomato. "Veg
etables are such things," Is stated In the
decision, "as are eaten after the soup and
fish, along with the meats, while . fruits
are eaten after the meats as dessert.
Therefore because tomatoes are eaten
after the soup and fish.' along with the
meats, they are vegetables." This was In
a case reported In the Supreme Court Re
porter, volume XIII, in a case where a
collector of customs demanded duty for
tomatoes on the ground that such were
vegetables, while the importer claimed
that they were fruit.

""â¢It will' be renumbered that .the 'men who\nomi
nated Mr. Schmitz did so during the excitement at
tending the labor strikes, and that the" movement was
an outcome of a discontent with the use of the police
to preserve- the peace. If that candidate be elected
the agitators, the demagogues and all the disturbing
elements of the community will undoubtedly look
upon the result as a victory for themselves and will
be encouraged,, to enter upon new disturbances. It
matters not that Mr. Schmitz himself is a conserva
tive and excellent man. The position he, holds as the
nominee of the class party makes him a representative
of that spirit, and it will be sure to .break out with
renewed turbulence if he be elected. < : ~,
Such being the case it behooves the people of San
Francisco to unite upon erne or the other of the two",
regular candidates. Ordinarily.it would be difficult
to effect such a union, for Republicans do not will
ingly support Democrats ; nor Democrats Republi
cans, but in this instance the choice has been simpli
fied to such a degree that intelligent men will have
no difficulty in making it. The candidate who holds
the Ma3 r oralty nomination on the Republican ticket
is in no sense the choice of the 'Republican party.
His nomination was dictated by the two Democratic
bosses of the Southern Pacific Railroad, Jere Burke
and W. F. Herrin. Of that there is no dispute. In
fact, Mr. Wells himself has frankly admitted seeing
Herrin about nominations for Supervisor, and in
several interviews has spoken of Herrin's control of
the situation quite as a matter of course.
. The statements made by Wells and other facts
brought out since the opening of the campaign have
disgusted not only the independent voters of the city
but thousands of stanch Republicans as well. It
would therefore be useless to attempt. to rally them
to support him against the class candidate. The ut
most that he can do is to hold the vote which is sub
ject to the corporations and their allies among the
political bosses. With all fairness to Mr. Wells it
may be said that whatever personal strength he had
before he was nominated has been lost largely
through his own words and actions since the nomina
tion. He now stands before the people as nothing
more than the nominee of Burke and Herrin.
It is therefore to the Democratic candidate, Mr.
Tobin, that the better elements of the city must look
for- leadership in this fight. Fortunately there is no
party principle nor even a partisan policy involved in
the issue. The most stalwart of Republicans can sup
port Mr. Tobin without in any way giving -even an
implied support to political doctrines opposed to Re
publicanism. The contest is purely local; there is
nothing at stake except the welfare of the city. The
question is the plain and simple one: Shall the peo
ple of San Francisco admit class politics, class an
tagonisms and class prejudices into the municipal ad
ministration?
Mr. Tobin obtained his nomination without making
pledges. He did not seek it. He accepted it only
because he recognized that it was a part of his civic
duty to serve San Francisco if the voters desire him
to do so. He will enter office under obligations to no
set of -bosses 'or corporations. He will fepreseht'no
class nor clique, but the whole community. Thpse
facts are well understood, and- after a careful canvass
of the situation we are assured that theonly man to :
whom the independent vote can be drawn is Mr.
Tobin. Such being the case, we advise Republicans
to support him. It is the only way of making sure of
defeating the class candidate.
AS the municipal campaign progresses it . be
comes more and more evident that if the gen
eral vote of the city be divided between the
Mayoralty candidates of the two regular parties there
is danger the next Mayor of San Francisco will be the^
candidate who was nominated to represent a single
element of the people and the peculiar class spirit by
which that element is for a time at least dominated.

retary of Agriculture will be asked for, to have special
charge of the animal industry of the country.:, -... ;
A demand will be made upon Congress for: such
amendment of the interstate commerce law as will
give' 5 the: commission power, to enforce its orders and
decrees. This matter; greatly affects the livestock Un
terest, since it is interstate commerce/and regula
tions for shipment are very vital ,to it. The yarding
and feeding, watering facilities supplied by the trans
portation companies, demurrage charges and many
other matters within the jurisdiction of' the Interstate
Commerce Commission require the. attention of that
body and the power to enforce needful rules and regu
lations. \u25a0 ; . - , V
The-livestock industry was the last of the great in
dustries of the country to organize. Manufactures
and agriculture long preceded it in organization.
But what it lacked in timeliness it has made up in ac
tivity. It has now the National Wool-Growers' and
the American Cattle-Growers' associations.. The first
includes the sheep industry and the second the cattle
interest only. As â¢ these interests are largely non
mergeable, each acts separately for itself in all mat
ters that are not common to both, and the two act
through'" the, National Livestock Association in all
matters that are common. . . .Â»
The meeting of December 3 will be.concurrent with
the national livestock show in* Chicago, which is one
of the greatest expositions of domestic animals in the
world. It attracts exhibitors and buyers from all the
stock-raising nations. '
We used to go to England for breeding stock in
neat cattle, swine, sheep and horses. Now the tide is
turned. The American herd books show, all over the
United States, the best pure-bred livestock to be
found anywhere, and our flocks and herds are now re
sorted to by European breeders for strains to recruit
their herds.
This annual exposition of livestock at Chicago is
an occasion ,of the greatest interest to American and
foreign breeders and will be the means of attracting
a large attendance to the livestock convention.

the distance in 2:09Vi and clipping one

a 2:09 clip, the onlookers burst into cheers.
Murnan continued his tactics of pulling
up the running mate and shouting at
Cresceus. The three-quarter pole was

head of the stretch Ketcham was seen to
call upon his horse for the final effort.
The etallion came through the straight

Ketcham did not touch him with the whip,
but urged him on with words of encour

Telephone James IMi,Miss Hecht is the youngest daughter cf
Mr. and Mi's. M. H. Hecht and is the
first debutante of this season to make
her entree into the. gay, bright world of
fashion. Miss Rose Ellen is a beautiful
girl, as sweet and fetching as is her quaint

Palms of this same variety along the
walls were artistically used to conceal all
the angles in the room. In the dining
hall the effect aimed at was red. Indian
baskets were hung upon the walls and
filled to overflowing with graceful ferns,
spreading greens and madrone berries.
The baskets with this wealth of flora
were held in place by immense true lovers',
knots of brilliant red satin ribbon. The
supper was served at small round tables,
and in the center of each was a handsome
floral piece, the prevailing tone of which

A physician was hurriedly summoned,
but Mr. Pumphrey had been dead for sev
eral hours, and therefore no attempt was
made to resuscitate him.
He retired at an early hour "Wednes
day night, and evidently waited until tha
rest of the family were asleep before ho
asphyxiated himself. When his wife went
to his room early yesterday morning to
awaken him she detected the odor of Il
luminating ga3, and found him dead In
bea, with the key cf the gas bracket fully
open.
-Pumphrey had been In a very despond
ent mood for several weeks because h4
had been requested by his superior of
ficer to break in a young man in his line
of work, and he feared because cf his ad
vanced age that the company intended to
discharge him from Its employment. Th'.s
fear was realized, and it preyed upon his
mind to such an extent as to impair hti
reason.

the Santa Ke Railroad Company, com

DRIVEN INSANE BY
'. / THE FEAR OF WANT
The work Is progressing under the dt
rection of the Board of Education. School
Director. Mark, who has taken a deep In
terest in the work, is superintending it.
The lot is 275 feet square and belongs to
the John Enright estate. The Supervisors
of this city have set apart $12,000 for es
tablishing:, the park and for apparatus. A
lease has been secured on the property
for one year, with the privilege of re
leasing it for a term of four years. The
rental for the property is $200 a month.
The playgrounds will be arranged after
the plan of those in the East. Plans havj
been drawn up by George Hansen ot
Berkeley and are now under consideration
by the Board of School Directors. Tho
quarters for the girls and the boys will bo
divided by hedges. The plan3 are v very
elaborate and Â©now where the various ap
paratus is to be located.
There will be a cinder path, handba!l
courts, giant slide, tanbark court with
parallel bars and other gymnastic appa
ratus in the boys' quarters. The girls will
have a giant slide, apparatus, sand court3
and other pleasant diversions.
It is provided in the plans to have shel
ters, washbasins, toilets and other neces
sary conveniences for the boya. A build
ing will be erected for the attendant an 1
caretaker.
The children will be allowed to use tha
grounds after school hours and on Satur
days. Teachers will Instruct the children
in the use of the apparatus, and every
precaution will be taken to prevent acci
dents.
School Director Mark belle-ess that tho
sum set apart by the Supervlaors will not
be sufficient to carry on the work, but ha
Is sanguine that generous citizens will
come to the aid of the department In per
fecting the new playgrounds.
Before spring the school children of this
city will have an ideal playground for
recreation. The grounds are located at
the corner of Seventh and ! Harrison
streets and caji be reached within a short
space of time by the littl^ ones. Work on
the park is now under way. The soft sand

Je re T. Burke a_ppeared before Super-
Visors' Public Utilities Committee, yester
day to explain why the Marbet-stree,t
Railway Company has failed to keep it*
promise made last January to take up
Its abandoned tracks and repave the road
way with the same material as the rest
of t:ae street. The meeting was called for
the purpose of considering Reed's pro
posfd ordinance to reduce street car fares
to 3 cents. The object of the introduction
of the ordinance is to hold it over the
bead of the big corporation with a view
to inducing It to carry out its promises.
When Chairman Reed took the .company
to task for not keeping its promise Mr.
Burke stated that Superintendent of Con
struction Lynch had denied that he had
made any such promise on behalf of the
corporation. Reed referred to the records
and found that Lynch had agreed to take
up the old rails and repave the streets by
November 1, UÂ«01, if it were possible to do
80. Lynch \u25a0was not present to disprove
the record, and Burke stated that the
company's law department had advised
that the company could not be compelled
to repave the streets when It had once
perlormed the work. He said that the
rails at designated crossings would be
takon up as soon as the necessary mate
rial arrived from the East. The inquiry
was then postponed until next Thursday,
â¢when Lynch is expected to be present.

sKraehwlnkel will take a place within,
the next> two weeks In the affections 6 r
the German- Americans of San Francisco
not inferior to that occupied by the be
loved towns and cities of the Fatherland.
Kraehwinkel is the magic town now
growing in the interior of Turn Verein*
Hall, at 323 Turk street, to serve the pur
pose of the golden jubilee fair of the San
Francisco ,Turn Verein.
The fair promises to surpass anything
yet attempted in the city. The interior of
the hall is being rapidly transformed Into
a typical old German town, and the rep
resentation will be complete. In what
ever direction the eye may turn there will
be seen tile-roofed and dormer- windowed
buildings, quaintly clustered and redolent
of old country; customs. â¢ Such great care
has been taken that the illusion produced
by carpenter and painter and decorator is
complete, and there will be no angles and
undisguised stairways and gallery rails to
mar the artistic ensemble.
The fair, in celebration of the fiftietn
anniversary of the San Francisco Turu
Verein, will open to-morrow night anl
will continue for nine day*.
As one enters the hall to the right of
the main street is seen the postofflce, with
the royal coat-of-arms emblazoned on its
wall. Next to it is the rathaus â the town
hallâ with courtroom and prison.
Citizenship of the Jail.
Visitors to the town of Kraehwinkel
will be compelled to become citizens, and
citizenship papers will be issued, worded
in old German. He who refuses to accept
citizenship will be incarcerated In the
prison. The rathaus has an imposing tow
er that boasts a real clock.
Back of the town hall are the fortune
telling and Turkish booths, illuminated
with quaint German lanterns. A flower

was furnished with statistics by G. A.
Dennison. the acttlng secretary of tho
board. \u25a0 \u25a0 -
Figures were also furnished in General
Chipman's report to show that Northern
California led the south In shipments of
green vegetables, canned vegetables, wine
and brandy. "It will be seen," wrota
General Chipman. "that, except as to cit
rus fruits, the orchards and vineyards t,f
California are in the north, and that
nearly all the oranges and lemons are in
the south."
General Chipman said of the citrus
fruit Industry of the south that its mag
nitude could be judged from the fact that
It amounted last year to nearly as many
carloads as the north sent out of green
deciduous fruits,- dried fruits and raisins,
combined.
Of the green deciduous fruits shipped out of
the State, 8799 carloads went from Northern
California and but nineteen from Southern
California. A like disparity will be seen to
exist in favor of Northern California in the
matter cf dried fruit, raisins and canned
roods. There went from the north, of dried
lrult. S490 carloads, and from Southern Cali
fornia ?.C9; of raisins there went from the
north 3421 carloads and from the south 161; of
canned goods from the north 4568 carloads, 492
from the south. To the shipments from the
north should be added those appearing in the
tables by sea from San Francisco, amounting
to 22S4 carloads.
Northern California Statistics.
When the Secretary of Agriculture was
notified of the mischievous averment for
which his department was responsible hj
took steps to have the real facts set forth.
Luckily the State Board of Trade has is
sued a careful review of the output of the
products of the entire State annually. In
the report for 1900 General N. P. Chipman
president of the State Board of Trade,'
set forth the following facts, which refute
the Imputations of the Government pam
phlet effectually:
The inference to be drawn from this U
that the remainder of California, north of
lehachapi, is less adapted to fruit grow
ing than is the section south. That
would natural. 1 y be inferred by readers
unacquainted with the real facts, and thÂ»
damage Is the greater because the pub
lication in which the statement was mado
bears the imprint of the United States
Government, fcjuch publications have a
wide circulation, going to European coun
tries and being sent to thousands of
farmers and other land owners in the
Eastern States, who are naturally influ
enced by what the Government publishes
as ascertained facts.
Wrong Inferences Drawn.
The injustice complained of was com
mitted in a pamphlet published by the De
partment of Agriculture, in which the fol
lowing statement was officially made:
The fruit Industry of the Pacific Slope' has,
within recent years, grown to enormous pro
portions. This is particularly true of South
ern California, which has a climate and soil
fcplendidly adapted to fruit culture.
. The United Statcs^Pepartment of Ag
riculture has sentTSi.'S: ; Holmes,', a special
agent of the department, to California on
a special mission, an important part of
which Is to right an injustice against Cen
tral and Northern Californiaâ all of that
part of .the State that lies north of Te
hachapi. Mr. Holmes has been in Califor
nia before and is well acquainted with
many sections of the PaciHc Coast. His
knowledge of the existing material con

lected to come here at .this time."- -

"Of my own knowledge and remembrance,
the signals that impressed themselves â¢ upon
me at the time were: 'Follow the flag.' I
had this repeated to the vessels following,
thinking that they might not see the Brook
lyn and might see us. I remember another sig
nal, 'One of my compartments filled with
water.' I recollect .It because it perplexed me
a little. I was fearful that the Brooklyn might
have to haul out of action and run ln-shore,
and I concluded that it .was given to me as
a warning in case she did haul out that I
would be prepared, to look out for the chase
alone and not to pay any attention to her and
that she would look out for herself. I also
remember a signal because I did not under
stand It at first: 'The enemy's ship appears to
have been built in Italy.' to which I told the
signal officer to answer: 'She will end on the
coast of Cuba.' , I also remember a signal"
â¢Congratulations over the j grand victory and
thanks for your splendid assistance.' There
were other signals made. I have seen the list
of them, but these are the ones I recollect
that 'made any Impression upon me at the
time.. Of my own recollection, I cannot recall
any others." \u25a0 '

maintained this relative position, bow and

nearly as I could Judge, and engaging any

deavoring to . come to close action with the

Captain Clark resumed the ! witness stand
after the luncheon recess. As he took his seat
Admiral Dewey remarked to those "near him:
"It is the best house yet."
Captain . Lemly â¢ announced that he had no
further questions. .
"No,. the 13-inch guns were fired after a con
ference with officers on board | the Oregon I
had feared damage to the. gun mechanism and
hesitated to \ use the guns, but decided to do
so. If any signal was made from the Brook
lyn I did not see it and it" was not reported
to me." \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 1
"Did you fire the 13-inch guns in pursuance
of a signal from the Brooklyn?" Hanna asked
and the witness replied:
Captain Clark was also questioned regarding
his statement in chief that the Brooklyn had
at one time - during the engagement engaged
four different vessels and confirmed his pre
vious testimony, saying that she was along
side all four of the enemy's ships, and in re
sponse to a question from Hanna as to whether
there were not other American vessels engaged
a.t the same time he replied: .
"The Oregon was firing as fast as she could
with her. bow guns."
Proceeding he said that for some time after
the Vlscaya went ashore, and when the Colon
only was left of the enemy's ships, the Oregon
did not fire, and when she did resume the
work only the 13-inch guns were used, with
the exception of one or two shots from the 8
inch guns . in the forward turret.
Speaking of the ranges used during the en
gagement he said that they changed so rapidly
he could not undertake to give them, and he
at last told the officers to decide the range
for themselves. . . . .
â¢ The witness also said, In response to another
question from Hanna, that while he had seen
the Texas, he had not noticed which way she
was heading, as It was his especial concern
to clear her.
Captain Clark's examination in chief occu
pied fifteen \u25a0 minutes and at ten minutes of 1
o'clock Hanna began the cross-examination.
"Did you," he asked, "see the Iowa during
the early portion of the engagement?" \u25a0 â¢
"Yes," replied the witness. "I saw the Iowa
standing in toward the entrance of the harbor
and her position was a little to westward of
the Oregon. At first she seemed to be steaming
faster than we were, and I thought she was
gaining ground and would get in ahead of us
Then the smoke became so dense that I lost
sight of her, but I could see' the Spanish ships
as they came. out. Later I saw her again so
near that I was fearful that the; two ships
would collide. . Consequently, I gave the or
der, 'Hard to' starboard,' and cleared her T
never saw the Iowa again during the actio'n "
Responding to a â¢ request ' from Hanna Cap
tain Clark described the manner in which the
Spanish ships ' came out of . the harbor
In response to another question he - said - that
the order^under- which he closed , in \u25a0 was a
standing order,, as was the order to attack at
once In case the enemy appeared.
"I 'remember." he "said. : "that I had a' feel-

Clark Cross-Examined.
"He turned and said: - 'Certainly, Schley, you
go also." I then felt that I had perhaps as
sumed too much in Â» speaking to an admiral,
and suggesting that a commodore also accom
pany me. I turned to the commodore and said:
'Commodore, we have knocked out several ves
sels this morning. We can knock out another
can't we?' He said: 'Certainly we can Come
on.' He-then started over the side and I
started after him for my boat on the other side
"What Impressed me was his cheery manner of
arf proving of my having mentioned his going
fend that he had no feeling against me for
mentioning it as a senior and was rather ap
proving in his manner."
"Was any conversation held between you
and .the commodore on board the New^York?"
"A Spanish battleship was reported by Cap
tain Eaton of the Resolute. She had arrived
oft Santiago and I think he said he had been
pursued by her. ' The admiral did not seem to
bo impressed by that. He seemed incredulous,
but I remarked that it must be Camara's fleet;
that they had arrived there to form a con-
Junction with Cervera's fleet, but they had
arrived too lote. The admiral did not assent.
Finally, he said: 'Well, Clark, you will have
to go after that ship,' and believing as I did
that there was a really Spanish vessel there, I
said: 'Admiral, In war we ought to overpower
an enemy if . possible. Why , could not the
Brooklyn go along?' " â¢
slon upon me to find her there, and I felt that
we- should mutually 'support and sustain each
other.. I felt that a battleship was needed and
that we- were. to be there together."

"Yes. sir."

saw him?"

OLD PEOPLE'S HOME
BAKERS FIELD, Oct. 24.â G. Erickson
when seen to-night, said that he knew
J. P. Rowe In this city between three and
four years ago. Rowe was at that time
superintendent of the asphalt works at
Asphalto, near Sunset. Erickson said
that Rowe was a single man of good
habits, to the best of his knowledge. He
was in . poor health and frequently com
plained of his physical condition, although
appearing to be a man of robust con
stitution. Rowe while in this city on a
visit would stop at the Arlington Hotel,
at which place Erickson was then a clerk.
Erickson stated that while he was well
acquainted with Rowe, he knew nothing
of any trouble which would lead him to
commit suicide unless it might be his
poor health. s . . ...
Inquiries made at the city addresses
found in the memorandum book showed
that no one was known at those places
who dressed in the manner indicated by
the clothing found on the wharf.
It is thought from tne fact that the
name J. P. Rowe" appears on each fly
leaf of the memorandum book found in
the overcoat and also that the piece of a
silk handkerchief found in the clothing
bore the initial "R." that Rowe was the
name of the owner of the clothing.
Inquiries made by telegraph in Bakers
field last night show that Gus Erickson
was formerly clerk of the Arlington Ho
tel and is now keeping a cigar store. Tib
bits was located as a watchman for the
Kern County Land Company.
In the pocket of the sack coat was a
small red leather memorandum book.
The names, "Gus Erickson, Arlington
Hotel, Bakersneld," and "Bert Tibbitts."
were written in pencil on one page and on
another was written "Mr. W. E. Burke,
please give the key to Joe; he has bought
the house, and oblige Rowe and Russell."
On a torn page of the book was written
"Antoine Cook, Asphaltum, Cala.; Georg
Wyley, Decota; 243 Third street, 1139 Fol
som street."
On the fly leaf of the book the address
"J. P. Rowe, Piute, Cala," was faintly
written in pencil and the same name ap
peared on the other fly leaf.
On the top of the clothing was found a
piege of a silk handkerchief with the let
ter "R" embroidered on it.
Absolutely nothing else waa found in
the clothing to give a clew as to the iden
tity of the owner.
At 10:30 on "Wednesday night H. F.
Stone, night watchman for the Simpson
Lumber Company, found the clothes on
the end of the Powell-street wharf.
Stone stated yesterday that he had seen
no one around the wharf and could throw
no light on the mysterious find. The cloth
ing consisted of a light brown top coat,
a dark blue serge sack coat, a black Fe
dora hat and a pair of black lace boots.
"A report was made; to the Police De
partment yesterday morning 1 of the find
ing of a man's Clothing on the â¢wharf at
the foot of Powell street on the previous
night, and it is thought the owner of the
clothing committed suicide by jumping
Into the bav. ".." '_' -

The finest contour of a female face, the

burrowing are called dandruff. To cure
dandruff permanently, then, and to stop

the dandruff germ and, of course, stops

NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â To-day's stock markrt

fessional operations in the market for an ad
vance, namely, the shifting of long accounts
from ose group of stocks to another by realiz
ing w>.ere an advance in price has already oc
curred end buying into a group that has been
quiescent. The group selected for the advance
to-day was the coalers. Tbe plausible reasons
for the advance in the prices of these stock?
were the fact that the present year's output
premises to be the largest- on record,- while
prices are firmly maintained at a profitable
level, both for the mining of the coal and its
transportation to market. The policy adopted
of beginning to advance the price of coal
several months ago brought it to the maximum
Intended on September 1. This has had the
result of keeping up the demand all through
the summer months instead of throwing the
requirements for the whole â¢winter on the period
of cold weather, but confidence Is professed
that the business will continue large through
out the winter, and much was made of re
ports that only lack of sufficient cars placed
a limit upon the anthracite and soft coal move

concentrate speculative attention of thesn
Etocks and the causes which moved them there
was realizing in St. Paul. Union Pacific. South
ern Pacinc and the Vanderbllts. which have
been advanced by the recent manipulation.
Rather less was heard of the Northern Pacific
settlement and the working out of extensive
financial plans In the transcontinental railroad
field. The forcing to cover of : a large out
standing short interest is an evident factor and
probably a motive for the operations for the
advance. The failure of a srsall brokerage
house, not a member cf the Stock Exchange
which was caught short of some of the stocks
recently advanced, was an indication of the
distress of that element. The heavy prpflt
taking In the Pacifies and St. Paul was em
phasized by the decided weakness of People's
Gas on threats of continued hostile lawsuits.
The stock fell an extreme 3 points, closing at

Court costs are eating big holes Into
Manuel Laveira's sack,, and by the timÂ»Â»
he gets through fighting his wife's suit
for divorce on the groundof extreme cru
elty he anticipates that the same' will be
considerably consumed. Laveira was
granted a non-suitagainst his wife to-day
by Judge Greene, but the victory was ob
tained at an expense In court fees alone
of $542, which represents. only the amount
of money it has cost to prosecute the
wife's case, 1 and does not include what hu
had to pay- out on his own account. The
trial has been 1 on eleven days now at a
cost per session of $10 for reporter's fees
making^ altogether 5110. The transcripts
required by the attorneys have cost &>
and two demands from the .wife: amount
ing to $3oO have been paid by the husband
making a total of 5542. Q|
Judge. Greene granted the non-suit upon
the ground that Mrs. Laveira. had taken
up- her residence in San Francisco after
leaving her husband and brought the suit
in Alameda County, which was. contrary
to the law governing the case. The evi
dence Introduced by the wife showed that
she had submitted to a system of abuse
extending over thirty-seven years, and
Judge Greene said that if her story wera
true it was the worst case of cruelty thac
â¢'ever occurred on God's green- earth" It
was evidently much against his will 'that
he granted the non-suit, but the law left
him no alternative. ' ,\
â¢ BERKELEY,- Oct. 24.â V. N. - Madoleff ,
a member of the Macedonian Society,
now residing in this city, has received a
copy of the Macedonian committee's offi
cial paper, the Reform, in which an ap
peal for help for^the Macedonians }s made
by the committee to the people of Bulga
ria. The appeal is signed by the six
members, of the committee. It has been
Issued for the purpose of securing money,
food and clothes for the Macedonian
refugees -in Bulgaria and for those-un
able to get away from Turkish outrage
and who are compelled to remain in their
native-land in poverty and in ; torture.
The "Appeal* to the Macedonian Peo
ple-as it is called, is translated by Mado
leff from â¢ the Bulgarian in part as fol
lows: ;\u25a0 â¢.. -
/ The Macedonian committee,' which has taken
un the holy cause to help our brother slaves In

ren is well known the heavy tyranny over our
brethren in Macedonia. This is to crush the
split of boldness of those who. are w^to
oboose the tyranny. The young are exiled.: the
rich are looted. The conditions now are worse
than ever before. The cry for help is coming
from an enslaved nation. In the name of this
tortured people the Macedonian committee seeks
the help of the entire Bulgarian nation. Bretlf

Madoleff firmly believes that the people
of Macedonia are on the verge of a. united
uprising, and . under the appeal ! issued
avowedly for ". the purpose of securing
charity ne sees a call to arms. As hope
less as an uprising may appear toothers,
Madoleff declares his people will;. never
stoD fighting. Conditions have arrived at
that point, he says, where they 8 will be
slaughtered any way, and that they had
better die killing Turks than be murdered
hv them without .a struggle. Jealousy
-irnone the nations make- it impossible for
the^Macedonlans to get outside help and
theVmust fight it out alone. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 , ; -

Complications in the Los Angeles
OIL PRODUCERS MAY
DISSOLVE ASSOCIATION
Situation Have Beached a
Critical Point.
LOS ANGELES, ! Oct. 24.â The oil situ
ation -in the local field is becoming com
plicated, and at the meeting . of - the pro
ducers to .be - held to-morrow morning
there is every possibility that the asso
ciation will disband in order to place -the
industry upon the basis desired. That, of.
course,, may appear a drastic remedv.
but the result of the producers' commit
tees' negotiation with President Griffith
of the Oil Storage Company this after
noon was such as to bring such a con
tingency well within the bounds of prob
ability.
President Griffith arrived in the \u25a0 city
Wednesday evening,' and, in accordance
with the prearranged plan. It was ex
pected he would meet the producers"
committee this afternoon. At the ap
pointed hour the members were informed
that President Griffith had gone. to San
Bernardino. ' He had left behind for the
committee, however, a. communication
that was in all essential particulars an
ultimatum. Though the comtnittteeraen
refused to reveal Its terms, it was moBt
unsatisfactory. It was stated that the
final proposal of the oil storage people
is such as cannot and will not be ac
ceptable to the producers.

POPULAR OAKLAND YOUNG LADY, THE ANNOUNCEMENT \\ OF
.WHOSE ENGAGEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN KEPT A SECRET FOR
SOME TIME, COMES AS A SURPRISE TO HER FRIENDS. ,â
The State Department has been inform
ed that negotiations are in progress be
tween Russia and China for a treaty un
der which the former will evacuate the
province of Manchuria. There is no dispo
sition on the part of the authorities to
credit Russia with designs conflicting with,
the declarations she has repeatedly made,
but in the interest of American rights ft
is deemed advisable to keep a sharp watch,
upon the developments in the negotiations
and energetically protest against those
which may menace American Interests.
The i Manchurian convention and. the- ar
rival of Special Commissioner W. "W".
Rockhlll in Washington were especially
interesting developments In the Chinese
situation from a Washington, standpoint.
Fresh from the scene of his triumphs in
Peking, Rockhlll was ushered Into. Secre
tary Hay's office this morning and from
that official received cordial congratula
tions upon the way in which he had con
ducted the negotiations. When The Call
correspondent later saw Rockhill he said:
"American prestige has been greatly In
creased by the moderate policy pursue*!
by the United States throughout the in
ternational occupation. All the Chinese
officials have given assurances of their
deep gratitude to this Government. ThÂ«
attitude adopted by Secretary Hay will
certainly be of great advantage in the fu
ture. Foreign trade is indebted to thj
United States for the material advantages
provided by the protocol. These include
the deepening of the water approaches to
Shanghai and Tientsin, the converting of
the tariff from ad valorem into specific
rates and the free importation of flour and
cereals. The improvement of the water
ways upon which Shanghai and Tientsin
are situated is one of the most important
things that could be done for the foreign
trade of China. The United States mado
the first suggestion that China, issue bond3
bearing a low rate of interest in pay
ment of the Indemnities demanded by the
powers and thus saved China many mil-
â¢ s Â°Â£mÂ°. llar3 ,: * have no doubt that
China will in the future, as in the past,
meet her obligations. Besides effectin^
the reduction of the indemnity and secur
ing the advantages named for foreign
trade. Secretary Hay was responsible for
the reform of the foreign office and court
ceremonies which the powers have been
endeavoring to secure for many years."

OROVILLE, Oct. 24.â The division of the
estate of the late Alfred Fuller has been
completed and some interesting -figures"
have been made public. The decree of the
court settling the final account and order
ing distribution was in accordance with
the terms of compromise agreed upon by
the attorneys representing the several in
terests. The compromise prevented an
appeal of the case from Judge Davis' de
cision awarding the estate to the half
breed son of the deceased. Fuller, but
lit made a hole in the fortune," which, after
young Fuller's attorneys were paid,
amounted to less than $4000. The exact
sum which- he will receive under the set
tlement is $3969 35, not a large percentage
of a $36,000 estate, but still a comfortable
start for him. â¢ â¢' - ..* --

REAL ESTATE . TRANSACTIONS.
The value of the estate has been vari-.
ously estimated at from $7,000,000 to $23,
000,000' and it is probable v that the latter
amount is more nearly correct. " . -'
In the month of June, 1900, the then ex
ecutor of the estate presented his final ac
count and petition for distribution. The
account was settled and distribution was
then made with the exception of $20,000,
which amount was ordered" reserved to
pay the claim of J. H.\ Campbell, the at
torney for absent heirs, in the eventthat
the litigation then pending over the claim
should result in favor of Campbell, the
claim, being one f<Jr compensation for his
services as such attorney. -..; .---.. .
Campbell, upon his appointment, was al
lowed the sum of $1000 per. month by the
court, which allowance continued for a
period of about . eight . years. Upon the
settlement of the estate Campbell claimed
that about $19,000 was due him, but the
court -held against him. An appeal was
taken by him to the Supreme Court,,
where the lower court was upheld.
Thomas I}. Bishop and Azro N. Lewis,
to whom the $20,000 was to be distributed,
assigned $10,000 thereof to the firm of Mil
ler & Lux, which in turn assigned $7500
of this amourit to Magdalena HoUzscher
er, Salome Lux ' Wolfe, Caroline Lux
Mitchell, George Lux and Emit Lux, and
the money was ordered distributed to
these parties. " ' " ' ' ""â¢ "
REDWOOD CITT, Oct. .24.â The affairs
of the vast estate of the late Charles Lux
were closed to-day; in the Superior Court
at this place. The estate has been in pro
bate in â¢ this county for a great many
years and has given rise t6 considerable
litigation. The fees paid out of the; estate
Tiave amounted to good-sized, fortunes.; 'â¢
Special Dispatch to The. Call.
SEATTLE, -Wash., Oct. 24.â The Alaska
Commercial Company's steamship Port
land, Captain j Linquist, with 620 . passen
gers' and over. three, tons. of gold dust, or
$2,000,000 -on board, arrived here: at- 8
o'clock ..this morning from St/ Michael'
and Nome, having left the former port
on Wednesday night, . October 9, arid the.
latter on Friday, October 11.- , :'i
\u25a0At St. Michael' all. business was practi
cally closed when : the. Portland loft,
about 250 of .the employes of : the * North-:
em Commercial " and Northern ; Naviga-=
tion companies being sent out on her.
The ; remainder will come on the Roa
noke, a. few being" left- to care for. the.
property of the\ companies' through the.
long winter season. ; ... '\u25a0 .â¢\u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0
The * steamer combine was fortunate
enough to get all its. Dawson freight^
away from St. Michael in time to reach
Dawson before the river closes,. probably, ;
although there is- some\doubt. about the \\
Lovelle -Young, an independent steamer
which was chartered and sent out with'
the last cargo for the Northern Commer
cial Company. Tne Dawson and White:
Horse ,â¢ Navigation- Company, however,'
running an opposition, line .on the river, "
was not so fortunate. This company
handled the cargo of the British steam-'
ship _Manauense, which arrived sp.'late
as to leave no chance -to get the cargo
to Dawson this winter. .. â¢. - .
There is said to be a regular stampede
around : the steamship offices in Noihe
and it is feared many who are anxious to
get. away this fall will not be able to do
so. Practically all of. the Northern Navi
gation Company's fleet of river steamers 1
were laid up for the winter .when, the:
Portland left St. Michael. The only river
steamer still afloat was the Herman.

LOS ANGELES. Oct. 2J.-S. A. Waldroa
to-day served notice on the city authori
ties that he will apply to the Attorney
General, of the State . for permission to
institute . quo , warranto proceedings
against the Los Angeles city officials now
holding office. He attacks the charter and
all its provisions, demanding that they
be declared null and" void and. that the
-Mayor and City Council be declared to
have no' right to hold office.
The complaint, further alleges that the
election for the adoption of the charter
was held thirteen days prior to the time
prescribed by the constitution and by rea
son of this prematurity of action the char
ter- of 1888, which is the charter under
and by which the administrative officers
of the municipality hold their power, is
now and has been of no effect or validity
whatever. *

The same speakers appeared laler at a
meeting of the Brotherhood of Teamsters
in tho Turk street temple. There was a
good sized crowd present and every. point
made against the Employers' Association
and each reference to the strike, which
Schmitz said would be impossible under
a Labor regime, were listened to with
.rapture. A brief address to the Garment
Workers in the Alcazar building com
pleted Schmitz's campaigning for the
night. â¢ . , . .
Schmitz was billed to talk at Power's
Hall, at Turk and Pierce streets and at
P^xley Hall, at Polk and Pacific" streets
but in his absence addresses were mario
by J.F. McEntee. John Murphy -It w
Roberts and G. W. Getchell. Little en
thusiasm was manifested. ,
At Washington Square Hall the Italian
colony, including the usual .large, per
centage of youthful card-seekers, was in
evidence when Schmitz arrived. A gentle
man by the name of Alberara abused the
employing classes to the evident delight
of his hearers in choice Italian.' He in
formed the 'scavengers present that
Schmitz thought" as much of them as : he
did of himself, whereupon 'a- number of
lads whistledliercely. "When Schmitz took
the stand there -was a slight demonstra
tion and when the , murmur died away
Schmitz retailed his stale jokes about
Tobin's polo pony and told of his own
love' for the downtrodden workingman.
The Schmltzian humor was appreciated
by the audience through the aid I of in
terpreters, who led the applause at the
proper , moments. Among the leaders in
the demonstrations of applause was A. B
Treadwell, the ex-Police Judge, who, hav
ing been turned down" by Martin, Kelly
has cast his piratical junk upon the sea
of Labor politics in search of prizes.
The next place visited by Schmitz - and
his orators was B'nai B'rith Hall, where
a meeting of the. Coopers' Union was in
progress. The meeting was very light,
but the Schmitzlan voice did not rest on
that account. Other speakers were J F

for Supervisors. - - .- \u25a0 ...... ,

Mr. Schmitz was scheduled to address
six audiences last night, but' when four
speeches had been delivered the Labor
standard-bearer decided to call it off. In
this respect he followed the example of

SCHMITZ' VOICE FAILING.
"It ls all on account of the Government
being behind in paying its bills," said Wil
liam T. Murphy, proprietor of the Fulton
Stables. 246 Second street, yesterday as
he was sorrowfully following a Humane
Society officer to the Hall of Justice to
pay damages for allowing injured. horses
to be driven from his stables.
Murphy has a contract for furnishing
horses for the mall wagons, and although
he believes his debts' are good, money
which should have been forthcoming more
than a month ago is still prospective. He
states that if he had been paid- on time
one horse would have not gone lame and
the sore on the shoulder of the other
would have been healed long ago. As the
case now stands, he will probably have to
pay a $10 fine.
Secretary , Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of. Cruelty to Animals
heard that Murphy was using horses
which were net in,, a fit condition to be.
driven. Officers McCurrie and Hooper
were at once sent down to make an in
vestigation. Hooper arrived at the stables
in time to see a horse going down the
road on three legs and drawing a mail
wagon. He at once interfered and the
animal was returned to the. stables.
At the Southern Pacific depot at the
corner of Third and Townsend streets Mc-
Currie captured another horse which had
a bad sore on Its shoulder.
When the haul, which included Murphy,
had been rounded up at the stables, the
proprietor explained that the Government
was responsible. It seemed Impracticable
to the Officers to arrest the Government,
so they took Jturphy away with them and
he was immediately . released on bail.
Postmaster Montague was informed of the
occurrence and gave the contractor an in
teresting half hour, in which valuable ad
vice played a prominent part.

THE CALL'S prediction that j the
Liquor, Dealers' Association would
not â¢ indorse any candidate ' was
verified yesterday. 'The assocla
.tion met at B'nai B'rith Hall and
knocked the life out of Revenue Collector
Lynch's scheme to procure the indorse
ment of Asa R. Wells and ten of the Re
publican nominees for Supervisors. Five
hundred f liquor \u25a0. dealers attended- the
meecing. They were in session four or
'five hours. Expressions ( of- individual
preference were freely given. Wells never
had the shadow of a chance in the contest
for approval. If there had been a vote on
the main proposition either Tobin .or
Schmitz would have developed the great
est strength, as mention of their names
was enthusiastically cheered. The liquor
dealers are now free to support the men
of their choice as they are released from
all political obligation to the association,
so l'dr as this campaign is concerned.
The directors of the association were
\u25a0 authorized at a meeting held early this
month to suggest a ticket for Indorsement
and according to the authority, conferred
made up a list of candidates to be sup
ported by the members. Jesse Marks was
one of the directors on the committee and
it is supposed that he got tips from Wells,
John Lynch, Max Goldberg and Jere
Burke. While the members yesterday
afternoon were in no wise inclined to
adopt the committee's recommendation
they yielded to a pressure of curiosity and
listened to the names sugegsted for-in
dorsement. â¢ .
Indorsed by the Liquor Men. :.
Here is the ticket for Supervisors recom
mended:
Bent (R.), Wilkins (R.), Alpers (R.). Bock
(D.), Beamish (R.). Stanyan (R.), D"Anoona
(D.), Eggers (R.). Ahearn (R.). Lynch (Labor),
McCarthy (D.). Boxton (R.), Connor (D.),
Stafford (D.), Nylan (R.), "Wasson (D.), Booth
(D.), Lilienfeld (R.).
In the light of the above suggestion one
can easily indicate the Republican nomi
nees who were slated for slaughter. They
were Collins, George, Offermann, Sander
son, Wilson, Cobb, Frankenthal and Me-
Williams. These candidates, who were
put on the black list as unworthy of sup
port, may reasonably ask Wells and Gold
berg why they were turned down.
W. H. Cobb is having a rough ' deal.
While he is giving days and nights to the
management of "Wells' hopeless campaign
and encountering such snares as only
peddlers spread - for his undoing,, Max
Goldberg, Jesse Marks and others in the
confidence of Wells are putting him on the
liquor dealers' black list. If the story be
true that Cobb advised the payment by
Wells of $50 for the indorsement of the
mythical Peddlers' Union the candidate
for Supervisor ought to have a guardian.
The story seems to have all the marks of
truth. Wells and Cobb went in a coupe
to secure the plaudits of the peddlers, but
there were no peddlers. The union con
sists of one man, who was enterprising
enough to secure $50 from the Wells cam
paign fund. ,
Great Mass Meeting To-Night.
The campaign signs point to the elec
tion of Joseph S. Tobin. Business men,
property-owners and other citizens are
cutting loose from party affiliations and
expressing their intention to vote for the
man who will give to San Francisco the
best government. Politicians estimate
that 60,000 votes will be cast on Novem
ber 5. and if Tobln's vote for Mayor ap
proximates his vote for Supervisor t^o
years ago he will be elected by a hand
some, majority. \u25a0 - i
The mass-meeting to be held this eveni
ing-in, Metropolitan: Hall will be the most
important demonstration of the present
municipal campaign. The meeting has
been called in the interests of clean, hon
est city government and for the purpose
of. laying before the citizens of San
Francisco the present political situation.
No candidates for office will address the
meeting. - /
Ex-Governor James H. Budd will pre
side. â¢ D. M. Delmas will deliver an ad
dress, which, In view ot the present con
dition of local affairs, promises to surpass
any of his long array of brilliant orations.
John H. Marble of the- Typographical
Union will also discuss the situation.
There will be other distinguished speak
ers, and as the hall will be taxed to its
full capacity it will be advisable for the
audience to make a point of "getting there
before 8 o'clock. -
It Is announced that Asa R. Wells will
attend a meeting at Garibaldi Hall this
evening and be permitted to speak. In
view of his experience last night he will
doubtless send out scouts in advance to
ascertain If there Is an audience in sight.

The allegation is made also that the
passage by the Supervisors of the ordi
nance cutting down the water rates de
preciated the quoted market value of the
shares from the normal of $97 to $83 and
$86. representing the usual range of fluc
tuation, thereby causing a loss to the
stockholders of $1,842,000 in the market
value of the shares.'.. It is set" forth that
the owners of the stock are entitled io
an, income of 6 per .cent per annum -upon
the par value of the stock, and that 7 per
cent per annum would be a fair remuner
ation in the premises.
It Is alleged that the ordinance of April
1, 1901, is unreasonable and was adopted
in an, illegal . manner; that section 1 of
article .XIV -of the constitution of tlv,
State of California is void; that- the ordi
nance is in violation % of the constitution
of the United States. because* it denies to
the \u25a0 complainant 'the equal protection . of
the laws, and that- it attempts to deprive
the plaintiff of. property iwithout -due pro
cess of law and to .take away private
property of the " complainant for public
use without just compensation.

The amended complaint sets forth that
the works, right of way, lands, pipes, Im

poration are of a value largely in excess
of $35,000,000; that the_ aggregate. Interest
bearing Indebtedness secured by mortgage
is ' $13,075,000; that the interest necessary
to be paid during the fiscal year ending

gate to not less than $640,000; that the
operating expenses for the same period
will aggregate $450,000, and that the taxes
will : amount to $250,000. The complaint
gives the value of capital stock Issued as
$14,000,000, divided into 140,000 shares, each
of the. par value of $100, all of which is
owned by more than 1800 shareholders. â¢

tificate of nomination without taking the
trouble to swear to the truth" of the mat
ter contained in the document.-.
Failure to have the certificate of nomi
nation properly sworn to is not the only
irregularity which will jeopardize the Re
publican nominees' claim to office to
which they may possibly be elected. The
Political Code requires that- the conven
tion shall appoint a committee to fill all
vacancies on the ticket. No such commit
tee was > appointed and in consequence,
when two nominees for Supervisors re
signed from the ; ticket, the Republican
County Committee named Joseph S. Ny
land and Frederick J. McWllliams to fill
the vacancies. The nomination of these
gentlemen is so irregular, and so flagrant
a violation of the code that it is extremely
doubtful in case of their election. If the
court will permit them to hold office.

So much to heart has Manager Cobh
taken the latest swindle of his candidate
for Mayor that he is seriously consider
ing the advisability of asking for police
assistance In the discharge of his duty a
guardian. â¢ Across Market, street, at the
other committee's headquarters there is
agitation In favor of appointing a guard
ian for Cobb. .
It now appears that Wells was crueliv
deceived and that "Spuds" Burke was th^
same party who approached all the cand;.
dates on the Democratic. Union 'Labor
and Republican tickets with an offer n
sell the votes of the Peddlers' Union for
the small consideration of $50. All B avÂ»
Wells refused to listen. SJUe
After almost a week's rest, taken to re
cover from the effects of his oratorical
efforts last Saturday night at Metropoli
tan Temple, Asa R. Wells girded on his
armor last night and started out on a de
termined hunt for votes. The Republican
candidate .for a time was truly roused
from his lethargy. He had bright visions
of whole blocks of votes that were to be
galne A, by . his mer , el y showing himself at
a peddlers' meeting in the vicinity of
Folsom street, between Fourth and Fifth
In fact, he had been promised by one
Thomas Burke, better known as "Spuds'*
Burke, that the Peddlers' Union was de
sircus of supporting him and that to train
KSfi.'" 1 but 'Â° sh Â°" &SS
stand, where he inquired the whereabouts
or the Peddlers' Union meeting hall
When he was told that no. one knew
where the hall was he requested that }Z
be. conveyed to the headquarters in order
to secure jiis manager. Cobb.. When Cobb
was secured, the hackman was instructed
to drive to Folsom street, between Fourth
and Fifth No meeting was in sight when
the Republican candidate reached Fol
som street, so up anu cown that thorl
oughfare he and his* manager rode look
ing longingly for the derelict peddler vo
ters. But. alas, they were nowhere to be
found. \u25a0 c
Finally, after almost an hour had been
consumed in the vain search on Folsom
street, the candidate' and his guardian
were carried to the vicinity, of Sixth an
Shipley streets, where a monster Tobln
ratification meeting was in progress
.At once the, face of the Republican can
didate orightened. Tha gladsome shouts
of the peddlers were already ringing in
his ears. He could hear the tumultuous
stamping of the feet and resounding clan!
ping of ihe palms. But al! this brich*
vision was destined to fade away likl â¢â¢
mirage before the sight of a wearv trav
eler. Not until he had descended fror^
his hack and entered the hall did he m?
cover his mistake, and then the ReDubii
can candidate betook himself silentlv an.i
softly away. . : - J uu
