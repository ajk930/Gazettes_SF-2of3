VOLUME XCâ NO. 158.
TOBIN'S FINAL SPEECH RINGS WITH APPRECIATION
OF CIVIC DUTY AND THE ISSUE RESTS WITH VOTERS
RAILROAD BOSSES ADMIT
THAT WELLS IS DEFEATED
His Campaign Comes to End in Lifeless
Meetings With the Standard Bearer
Absent, Hopeless of His Own Success
7 HE Registrar's ofhee reports
the return of 12,783 sample
ballots sent out by mail. This
return reduces the actual registra
tion to 65,307. Estimates of the
vote to-day range from 53,000 to
57,000, The judgment of the best
informed politicians is that Tobin
will receive so large a percentage
of the silent, conservative vote that
Schmitz cannot be elected. Wells
is out of the race. His headquar
ters was closed and in darkness at
o o'clock last night. It was re
ported that he was sick at home.
The defeat of the Supervisorial
ticket put up by Herrin and Jerc
Burke is assured. The bosses,
however, were bending all their
efforts last night to save Wells, but
politicians would not be surprised
if they Hopped over to Schmitz be
fore noon io-day.
pW \ HEF-E was a conference yester
m day of the bosses and attorney
THEP.E allied corporations. The
day of the bosses and attorney
sf the allied corporations. The ;
H contest for Mayor was reviewed, i
After exchange of views the con
clusion was reached that Wells
could net be sleets*. His headquarters Â¦
was closed and darkness reigned there at I
Â» o'clock last evening. He did not nil en- !
gagements to speak last night. Early In
the evening It was said that he was indis
posed by reason of the physical and men
tal fatigue of the campaign. Later la the
evening It was stated that sickness In his
family was the cause of bis non-appear
ance.
It is known that the bosses and cor- :
porations are ready to sacrifice every- ;
thing and everybody to beat Tobln. They
recognize that Wells is out of the race,
and as between Tobln and Schmltz they
prefer the latter, and in line with that de
cision have told the rounders to break in
for Schmltz.
Supervisorial Ticket Doomed.
The Supervisorial ticket put up by the
allied corporations Is doomed. Nothing
can save It. The few good men will prob
ably go down with the tough customers
picked out by Herrin's orders.
In the event of Tobln's election, which
now seems assured, the- bosses would not
be able to control anything at the City
HalL Schmitz Is an unknown quantity.
At the conference It was suggested that
.he might be brought around. It was
' argued that he might be manageable,
' whereas Tobln was on record against cor
porate- aggression.
It Is the imperative duty of citizens, ir
respective of party affiliation, to unite on
Tobin. In no other way can the defeat of
fjchmitx be accomplished.
Candidates Worthy of Support.

good citizenship will make no mistake to

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY,. NQV^fMBBR 5, 1901,
CONDEMNATION OF SCHMITZ SPOKEN
OUT OF MOUTHS OF HIS PARTISANS
Contention of McCabe and Wisler That the Union Labor
Leader Was Not Dealing With the Risdon Iron Works
Proved to Be False by' Documents Published in The Call
THE statement or Eugene E.
rtchmltz. who has been officially
declared guilty of performing
work for non-union concerns
during the machinists' strike,
that he did not do the work
complained of for the Rlsdon
Iron Work*, but for J. C. Kltton. was
received with laughter yesterday by all
who are connected with the iron trades.
The attempt to cover his delinquency by
tittering a falsehood served rather to ag
gravate than condone his offense against
the union cause.
The misleading statement which was is
sued by President McCabe and R. I. WiÂ«
ler, business agent of the Iron Traded
Council, with the indorsement of Bchmlti,
reads as foliows:
Over two mohthi ago thÂ« rumor that Mr. Mc-
Carthy now KÂ«ka to transform Into a fact-r
nmnely. the rumor that Mr. Hrhmlt* was Tlolng
work for the ftlsdon Iron Worksâ was thor
oughly Investigated by both of us. We found
Mr. Bchmlts ready to show us his books and
explain every detail of the transaction. This
wÂ»rk wax ordered' by 3. C XlttAn and not by
the Hin'lon Iron Work*. We Investigated this
phase of tbe question particularly, and there Is
not In existence, so far at' we know, one scrap
of evidence-to prove that Mr. Schmlts, In word
or deed, was dlsloysl to the union In the trans
action that ,1s now being used at a weapon to
accomplish the purposes of a political schemer
who has not the Interest* of the trades unions
at heart. Mr. Schmltz made cylinders for J. C
Kltton, not for me Rladon Iron Works, and we
reaffirm the atatement that union machinists
have no reason to object to Kltton, although
we have every reason to object to work being
done for the, Rlsdon. , Mr. Srhmlts has nothing
to fear front the charges preferred so far, un
less he Is Judged by Employers' Association
standards. Â¦ .
Documentary Evidence.
On the" day following the original pub
licatlen of the story of Bchmit*\ treaxon,
Tho Call printed in facsimile the story
of his betrayal of the union cause. By
documentary evldenco it was shown that
on June -12 Schmlts wrote to J. C Kltton
of the Rladon ' Iron Works stating that
he (Schmlti ) would build two ammonia
compressors for the gum of 1630 each. On
June 1Â« Mr. Kltton, writing for the Ris
don Iron Works, accepted the offer made
by Schmlts, and Instructed him to have
the machines ' in readiness within forty
five days. The Economist Qas Engine
Company, of which Schmlts Is the head,
performed the work, and on August 30
Bchmiti rendered a bill to the Rlsdon
Iron Works for H144 BS. The bill on being
O K'd by Kltton was Immediately paid.
The lame attempt of Schmlts to shift
the responsibility for his violation of
union principles on the plea that he was
doing tho work for Kttton and not the
Rlsdon Iron Works falls flat when It is
shown that Schmits knew very well that
Kltton was an employe' of the Rlsdon
Iron Works, and that the work was not
ordered by Kitton for himself independent
of the Rltdon Iron Works. Schmltx was
well aware at the time he accepted the
contract that ht wan dealing directly
with the Risdon people, and his attempt
to evade the responsibility for his act
Is puerile and ridiculous.
McCabe and Wlsler of : the Iron Trades
Council say that had the work been don*
for the Rlsdon Iron Works they would
have every reason to object. Kltton' s
correspondence with Schmlts was written

1 OSEPH S. TOBIN attended
the last meeting and made the
final speech of the campaign
last night at Pythian Castle. Tke
audience was limited only by the
size of the hall. The meeting was
the most enthusiastic of the cam
paign. Tobin spoke briefly and te
the point. He was greeted zvith
rousing cheers, and was given a
parting round of applause such as
candidate has rarely received. He
told of the campaign and summed
up in a concise manner the issues
upon which the public will to-day
give its verdict. His speech was
a business-like review of the situa
tion. If his reception last night by
as reprcsmtathe an audience as
could be gathered in San Francisco
is any criterion. Joseph S. Tobin
will be the next Mayor of San
Francisco.

LAST WORDS SPOKEN IN GREAT UNION LABOR PARTY MEETING
AND IN SMALLER REPUBLICAN GATHERINGS IN THE DISTRICTS
UNION LABOR CAMPAIGN CLOSES
WITH BIG MEETING AT TEMPLE
Thousands of Workingmen Greet Schmitz
and Other Candidates and With Wild
Cheers Assert Loyalty to Union Cause
THE Union Labor party closed its
campaign with - a tremendous
rally at Metropolitan Temple last
night. The gathering was the
largest of the campaign. Thou
sands were unable to get into the
hall, and for the benefit of those
who were on the outside an open-air meet
lug was held. Speakers and an augment
ed band served to make the stay of the
populace in the street enjoyable.
The crowd that was packed in the hall
was essentially a gathering: of working
men. That they were enthusiastic in the
cause in which they have embarked was
manifested on several occasions during
the evening. The various speakers were
received with cheers and their remarks
mere greeted with favor. Every allusion
to Schmitz was applauded to the echo,
while references to both Tobin and Wells
were hooted and groaned at.
The LÂ»ibÂ«Â»r standard-bearer was given
sv reception which might well have flat
tered the price of any man who aspires
to an office which is dependent upon the
will of his fellow men. His enemies mere
given to understand that as far as the
worklntraen in the hail mere concerned
they would brook none of his rivals for
the Mayoralty. Every speaker who men
tioned the came of Schmitz was sure of
*. cheer even though the sentiments ut
tered by him were below mediocrity. It
was a bid for favor of which all the
tweakers availed themselves.
The crowd mas good natured and lis
tened to commonplace and ungrammatlcal
addresses uncomplainingly until after
â¢chanitz was heard from. Efforts were
then made to continue the meeting, but
the audience refused to listen. They had
teen their hero and the sight of Mm had
warmed the cockles of their hearts. That
the meeting from the standpoint of Union
Labor was a success no man could deny.
Addresses to Workingmen.
The meeting mas called to order at S
o clock by Mr. Perry. He introduced as
chairman of the evening Walter Mac-
Arthur, editor of the Coast Seamen's
Journal. Chairman Mac Arthur in accept
ing the honor said that the struggle for
the emancipation of labor in San Fran
cisco was over and the victory won. The
tight was a warm one and no efforts were
spared by the opposition to belittle labor
and carnage the cause of unionism. He
denounced The Call. Chronicle and Bul
letin, the Employers' Association, the
Banding Trades Council and all who were
opposed to the Labor ticket. The address
â¢Â«as frequently interrupted by applause.
After a solo, which got the audience into
a pood humor. Michael Casey was intro
cacÂ«d. He said that he had heard every
cay during the campaign that the labor
unionists would never stand together on
political issues. Continuing he said:
We will stand together to-morrow, at any
rate. We have enemies who are vilifying us
nil the time. What are the papers doing'
.Â¦hey '.ell us that we must vote for Tobin If
we hope to get Justice. If we want the
t '.ailis c? slavery put on us we should vote
for Â¦VW'.i. What is the man who don't vote
ts-.* .abor ticket â¢.o-morrcw? (Cries of "scab"
it.-5 will cheers.) That's right. Don't any
cf you "scab" the labor ticket to-morrow.
.That's all I've got to say.
Repeated cries for "Jack" Daughney ne
cessitated his introduction to the audi
ence. "Jack's" power of oratory' did not
equal his popularity, but his promise to
do his duty as Tax Collector, if elected,
mas greeted with cheers. In 1563, he said.
Lincoln liberated the slaves, but to-mor
row the laboring men of San Francisco
Â¦wculd free thetaseives from corporation
rule.
Walter Gallagher predicted an over
whelming victory for the labor ticket. He
taid that the. election mould put the po
liceman's club out of business. The dem
onstration, he believed, would put to the
blush the claims of enemies to labor that
the union ticket was a class ticket. It
mas not classes, but masses which back
ed up the Union Labor organization. ThÂ»
speaker recommended the election of va
rious candidates, and said that the fight
was practically won. If the workingmen
of San Francisco did cot elect their ticket
they would deserve the punishment of
extinction of unionism which the Em
ployers' Association would visit upon
them.
Charles Kelly of the Longshoremen's
Protective Association was Introduced as
a man who would refute the statement of
an evening newspaper that there was dis
affection among the longshoremen.
Kelly eaid the membership of the union.
Su^j strong, was solid for the labor ticket
and that they would vote the ticket
straight. The Information was greeted
With cheers, and Kelly retired.
Schmitz Received With Cheers.
The entrance of Eugene E. Schmitz at
the close of the address was the signal for
a tremendous demonstration which lasted
precisely three minutes. The entire audi
ence rose to its feet and yelled itself
hoarse. For a time the din was aston
ishingly fierce. Women waved their
handkerchiefs and men, many of them
â¢with canes, hurled their hats aloft. The
demonstration ended with three cheers. In
which the entire audience Joined.
Thomas Ka*can next paid his respects to
the- Employers' Association. Phelanism
and "Shoot-Low" Sullivan. The surcease
from sorrow, according to Eagan, was to '
be found 'm the election of the Labor
ticket from, top to bottom. Its election
meant peace and prosperity for the city.
Jt meant also the emancipation cf labor
from conditions under whi^h the work
lngmen have so long toiled as slaves. Al
lusions ie Phelan. Sullivan, Â«McNab and
others "were greeted with hoots and cat
calls. 'Â¦.
Fred J. de Succa, who was Schmltz's
opponent for the Mayoralty nomination
In the ' Labor party convention, paid a
tribute* to the personnel of the I,abor
ticket. He said the various candidates
were selected because of their ability,
and popularity. Wells was declared to
be "a political lobster of the seventeenth
degree." Tobin was referred to as a man
of silly tendencies and an hereditary
enemy of the workinarmen of San Fran
cisco. On the other hand, Schmitz was
on intellectual a* well as a physical giant,
and possessing abilities of a high order
is In a position to discharge his duties a*
Mayor with honor and credit to the Labor
party and himself.
A succession of brief Â¦ speeches by la
bor candidates followed. The crowd de
sired to, hear Schmitz. however, and when
*â¢ speaker took his seat the gallery
roared for Schmitz The chairman, con
scious of the fact that the crowd would
melt away like mint in the sunshine after

nience to do so. As a compromise he
announced tHat only two minute

nolly, the first speaker after this ulti
matum, devoted fully fifteen minutes to
a ringing denunciation of "that traitor,"
P. H. McCarthy and the Building Trades
Council. Dr. Dillon,, candidate for Cor
oner, spoke cheerfully of how he would
handle the corpses or his hearers, should
they be unfortunate enough to fall dead,
or be killed after his election. In quick
succession P. J. Coyle. Patrick Murphy,
K. W. Roberts, H. McKevitt, W. J. Wynn
and Washington Kugler made brief talks
and retired.
Address of Standard-Bearer.
The introduction of Schmitz was fol
lowed by another wild manifestation of
enthusiasm, and when the din subsided
lie said:
I wonder whether The Call. Chronicle. Bul
letin and Post will say to-morrow that I have
been talking to empty benches? We are on
the eve, of a battle for representation, a battle
fought by our forefathers amid storm and
rain a hundred years ago. They won their
right, and we have enjoyed the. blessings of
their victory. ThÂ« worklngmen of San Fran
cisco have not to make the sacrifices our fore
lathers did, and I know that If they do their
duly to-morrow the victory Is won. (Cheers.)
We, a* worklngmen, have not had the proper
representation in municipal a flair? It was not
because we are not able enough to discharge
public functions, but because the leaders of
the other parties are not in sympathy with
us. Our ticket represents a principle, and you
should not scratch that ticket. If we are suc
cessful the Interests of labor will be sub
served. The news of a labor victory here will
go abroad to tell the world what united labor
can accomplish. We have been fooled by thÂ«
old parties and we are getting tired of It. The
time has com* for us -to take charge of munici
pal affairs, and we are going to dc it (Cheers.)
They call us & class ticket. Let It be so. if
the election of such a class ticket will give
laboring men as well as rich men equal rep
resentation. I believe in fair treatment to all
and special privileges to none. I never was
In favor of using the Police Department to
protect one class as against another. If I am
elected Mayor the spectacle of policemen riding
on trucks and guarding men who ought to be
in tb^&^te Prison will never be witnessed in
San WmmOtm. (Cheers.) If elected I will
be Mayor of the whole people.
Schmitz closed with his old statement
that his administration would certainly
be an honorable one. The crowd gave
him another ovation, and attempts were
made to introduce other speakers. The
crowd was satisfied, however, and after
hearing a set of resolutions of a carpen
ters* union condemning ; the Building
Trades Council and indorsing Schmitz
dispersed with three cheers for the Labor
ticket.

THE SAN FttANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5. 19 >J.
NON-PARTISANS WARN THE PEOPLE
OF A CONSPIRACY OF CORPORATIONS
Honored Citizens Unite in Calling Upon Voters to Protect
the Interests of the Municipality by Giving Support
to Joseph S. Tobin and Present Board of Supervisors
the Voters of San Francisco:
J The late Joseph Britton and A. S. Hallidie, founders of the non-partisan move
ment, left us a record of unselfish devotion to clean government. Having been instrumental
in securing the adoption of the new charter, and in electing an honest government to put it in mo
tion, this party has not deemed it necessary to participate in recent elections. It has, however,
maintained its organization, ready to act whenever any crisis in municipal affairs threatened the
public good.
This party believes that such a crisis has occurred.
Aggressive and greedy corporations, controlling public utilities and franchises, in combina
tion with every degraded boss that has ever brought disgrace on this city, have combined to force
a government onjhe people.
If this conspiracy should meet success, honest government will be dead for years to come,
and the people zt'ill be at the mercy of corporate and official rapacity.
The Board of Supervisors now in office has been honest, intelligent and effective:
It has lowered water rates.
It has lowered gas rates.
It has lowered taxation.
It has lowered carfares for school children.
It has improved street lighting.
It has improved the streets.
It has improved the municipal buildings.
It has paid the debts of the city.
As many as have been renominated should be re-elected*. The all-important offices are the
Mayoralty and the Board of Supervisors.
FOR MAYOR.
Joseph 8. Tobin has been cne of this best Board of Supervisors- We recommend his election as
Mayor.

ance was slim, and while the speakers
aroused applause by reference to the rec
ord of the Republican party In national
politics, they carefully avoided any men
tion of the vital issues that are to be set
tled at the poll? to-day.
Wells was not in evidence at the meet
ings, and no apology was made for his ab
sence. The voters did not miss any valu
able information, as the railroad candidate
for Mayor has thus fnr failed to give any
intelligent reason as to why he should be
elected to the honored position of chief
executive of San Francisco. Tho last
night of the Wells campaign was a
mournful affair in every way.

League at Garibaldi Hall. 423 Broadway,

Shortridge. He made no reference to the
issues of the compalgn. but told of the
deeds of the colored men in American his

had taken part In the various wars of the
American nation.
A. B. Mahony. the Republican candidate

TWOMEY HAD APPROVAL
OF TEAMSTERS' UNION
Did Not Work as a "Scab" Laborer
During the Becent General
Strike.
The following answer to the accusations
that Ed Twomey, one of the accusers of
Eugene E. Bchtnitz, worked as a non
union teamster during the strike is pub
lished in justice to a man who has brave
ly done what he conceived to be his duty:
In reply to Mr. Casey, buslnless agent of the
Teamsters' Union, and Mr. M l-auÂ«lln. secre
tary thereof, regarding the accusation that Mr.
Ed Twomey was a scab during the teamsters'
strike. I desire to say that Mr. Twomey was In
my employ previous to the strike as a team
ster's helper and did not drive any of my
wagons during the strike. Mr.' Twomey worked
fur me as a driver's helper anil was granted
the privilege by Mr. Mitchell, representing the
Brotherhood of Teamsters In that part ot the
city In which I did hauling, to drive my wagon
from my barn to my stand, and also drive it
home. This was done by Mr. Twomtjf for two
days, when Mr. M. Lauglln objected to the
same, and thereupon Mr. Twomey declined to
drive the same. and, further, Mr.
Twomry even declined to drive my
wagon while empty. I therefore think
It an Injustice- to Mr. Twomey to accuse him of
being a "scab" during the late teamsters'
strike. He Is one of the most consistent union
men I have ever known, and the attack made
on him Is most unjust, unfair and cowardly.

JEWISH CITIZENS INDIGNANTLY
DENOUNCE A BULLETIN SLANDER
Representative Hebrews Express Confidence
in Joseph S. Tobin and Their Contempt for
the Eleventh-Hour Newspaper Falsehood
THE Bulletin yesterday published
an article to the effect that
Joseph & Tobin had expressed
himself in a manner disparaging
to the Jewish race. The Bulletin
also took upon itself the right to
express Indignation on behalf of
Jewish citizens Â»t Mr. Tobln's alleged re
fusal to purchase twenty $1 tickets for
a ball given on Sunday night under the
auspices of the Young Men's Hebrew As
sociation.
The article, which is taken by every
Hebrew in San Francisco as a personal
insult, was shown to Mr. Tobin late last
night.
"This story is a malicious lie," he said.
"It is entirely false from beginning to end.
It is evidently a deliberate campaign lie
Invented and published at the last mo
ment, on the eve of election, when little
or no opportunity is presented for a denial
or refutation."
The story was originally circulated in
the Interests of certain betting men for
obvious reasons. A report of its circula
tion reached the officers of the Young
Men's Hebrew Association on Sunday
evening. Prompt steps were taken to
deny it and long before the Bulletin story
was written the Bulletin authorities were

all over this city. I have been told time and
again that this is not a partisan struggle. I
nave been assured by hundreds, aye. by thou
sands of lifelong Republicans that they will
support and vote for the Democratic ticket in
this campaign. It shows that San Franciscans
can sink partisan issues and vote with an eye
only for the public welfare. (Applause.)
Gentlemen, to have carried on this campaign
alone would Indeed have been a tremendous
burden, but your splendid co-operation and the
kindness and courtesy that I have received on
all hands from people of ail parties have made
the task In reality an experience to which I
shall always look back with pleasure and grati

I want to extend now from the bottom of my

Gentlemen, we close this campaign Inspired
by the feeling that we have conducted aa
honorable, straightforward, manly canvass. We
have appealed to the Intelligence, the patriot-
Ism and the common sense of our fellow cit

In this effort. I am sure that when the polls
close to-morrow evening the result will show
that our cause has been completely triumphant
and that for the next two years boas -ule and
corporation control will be things unknown in
our city government. (Cheers.)
The indorsement of Tobin for Mayor by
George K. Fitch, speaking for the Citl
tens" Non-Partlsan party, and the unqual
ified support given to Tobin by ex-Mayer
K. B. Pond and Thomas Magee have hai

Many citizens of the conservative taxpay-

San Francisco. November 4.
Rabbi Voorsanger last night said that
the article in the Bulletin would be re
sented by the Jewish community.
"I think I know the Jewish community,"
he said, "and I can safely say that they
fully understand the animus of 3uch a
publication on the cvÂ© of election. Many
of us are depositors in the Hlbernia Bank
and have had personal dealings with Mr.
Tobin, I have known him for a great
many years as an intelligent American
gentleman and do not even require his
denial to stamp the Bulletin article aa
false in spirit and fact."
Rabbi Nleto made the following state
ment:
"As the promoter of the Young Men's
Hebrew Association I have conducted m
Investigation with a view to determining
the truth of the remarks attributed to
Joseph S. Tobtn, and I find that there is
no authority whatever for any words that
bear reflection upon the Jewish com
munity, and no, truth In any statement
that could place Mr. Tobin In the position,
of entertaining any prejudice against thÂ«
association in question or any person or
persons affiliated with the Jewish com
munity.
"I believe from what I know of Mr.
Tobin that be is Incapable of any such
feeling, far less any expression of the
kind. I do not believe that any decent
Jew would tolerate any such pernicious
tactics."

pany was to the Risdon Iron Works, not

Enormity of Offense Admitted.
McCabe and Wisler have admitted the
enormity of the alleged offense, and in
trying to condone it they or Schmitz or
ali three of them have resorted to false
hoods which is made evident by the
documents which have already been
placed In evidence by The Call. To say
that Eugene E. Schmitz was ignorant for
a moment that the contracts entered Into
were for work for the Risdon Iron
Works is pleading imbecility In exculpa
tion of treason to unionism. If Eugene E.
Schnaltz did not know that those ammo
nia compressors were being made for the
Risdon Works he is not fit to sit In the
Mayor's chair. If he did know it be is
convicted of double dealing and his union
labor apologists. McCabe and Wisler, are
guilty of breach of faith with their fel
low-ur.lonlsts and with the public.
That McCabe and Wisler should rush
to Schmitz' defense with a lying circu
lar was to have been expected when it
is considered that both will be cared for
in the event of Schmitz' election. The
damning proof of Schmitz' treachery to
the cause, of unionism as furnished by
The Call on Saturday has aroused a bit

ISTHMIAN CANAL
NEGOTIATIONS
Secretary Hay and Lord
Pauncefote Hold a
Conference.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 O STREET. N.
TV.. WASHINGTON. Nov. 4.-The official j
negotiations of the new Isthmian Canal j
Convention were begun and concluded to- |
day by Secretary Hay and Lord Paunce- j
fote, the KngUsh Embaesador, at a con- |
ference which lasted twenty minutes. I
Only the formal signature of the conven- j
tion remains to make it a fait accompli.
At the fame time this important diplo
matic discussion was in progress. Rear
Admiral Walker, chairman of the Isth
mian Canal Commission, called a meet
ing of the commission for November 12,
tv place the last touches upon its final re
jrort, which will recommend the construc
tion of the Nicaragua canal.
*'i 111-; has been the most Important day
in the history of the isthmian canal ques
tion. Before Ambassador Choate left Lon
don on a l<-i\e of absence he advised Sec
retary Ha>- that an agreement had been
reached on all the points of difference
with the Bntlsh Government respecting
the canal convention, and while Lord
I'auncefote Â»us thus anticipated, his MM
tag-: to the faccretary to-day was none the
lew' ;.< < ejÂ»t just; and important. The fact
mat i/ftV..i; negotiation* were begun a riÂ«i

concluded the preliminary negotiations,
l^ord i'auncclote assured Hay that he is
provided with such extensive authority
mat it will lot even be necessary to cable
to London tl.e text of trie treaty copy of
the convention, which Is now being pre
pared by the State uvpartment irorn tne
protocols hitherto agreed upon> As soun
iÂ»3 two copi â¢â¢< are engrossed the signature
of the convention will occur. No (lute bun
yet been lixed, nor Is there any disposition
on the part of the administration to un
duly hasten this event.
lioth Governments are agreed upon
every detail and In fact every word of the
new treaty. The notes and views which
have teen exchanged are of course not as
binding an would tÂ»; it formal treaty, but
the authorities nay they have so clearly
â¢jeflaed Urn positions of the two Govern
ments :ir.<l established such an absolute
agreement that there is no reason to ap
pieher.d that uny new diplomatic obstacle
will arise. The only qucxticn remaining to
be mined is that of the ratification,
and while tin; authorities are hopeful that
ltvvill be given, in view of the activity of
the opposition there is naturally some un
certainty. The administration officials*
positively assert that there is no founda
tion for the reports from London that the
United States has given a quid pro quo
for the consent of Great Britain to the
abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
"There Is nothing in the new conven
tion." itaid an official who is qualified to
up<iik, "which relates to anything but thÂ«
canal. Tho Clayton-Hulwer copventlon la
abrogated. No rr/crence Is made to tho
prohibition against the fortification or oc
cupation of Central America, as was pro
vided by this convention."
The officials are, of course, unwilling to
make, public the exact language of the
provisions negotiated by the two Govern
ments to meet the views of the Senate,
but it Is Raid that the upper house of
Congress has no reason to be dissatisfied
with them. Besides the abrogation of the
Clayton-Kulwer treaty, the neutrality of
the â¢ tiv;il Is guaranteed by the United
Mates, although It Is bound by the rules
governing the administration of the Sues
canal, and there la no reference in the

suggestion that he Is not a sure winner,
and all attempt* to hnv..- him draw out.-so
as to make It easier for ono of tho other
candidates, have met the defiant declara

from the outlook to-night It in a content

A mint of money has been spent by the

FORTUNE TELLER INFORMS JEFFRIES
THAT GUS RUHLIN WILL CONQUER HIM
Hermit Prognosticates Defeat of Champion in Tenth Round.
Jeffries Dreams That He Will Win in That Number and
Is Therefore Not Worried â Ruhlin Is in Superb Shape
HARBIN SPRINGS, Nov. 4.-Jef/
fries has been In a quandary all
day. A hermit told his. fortune
' yesterday and informed "the I
champion that he would be de
feated in â¢ ten rounds, and Jim had a
dream that he would win In the same
number of rounds. He has so much con- |
fidence In himself that, he believes the j
dream will come true.
Jim observed the Sabbath by resting In

that mihlin would knock him out when

Although Jelfrles laughed about the I.J

divulge what he had learned until this
morning. He men told his I lends i that
he had dreamed that he laid Ruhlin low
In ten rounds. He now says the dream
evens up things.
In No HurTy to Return..
As the time draws nearer for Jeffries
to leave this place for the scene of his
future struggle, it looks as If the cham
pion would postpone It until a few days
before the tight. Billy Delaney. who Is
I responsible for the big boxers condition,
! is opposed to Jim going to the city next
Friday as he intends uolng. Delaney is
i afraid of the change of food and climate,
' but he Is even more afraid of the multi
tude of advisers, who are always willing
to give gratuitous advice to a man train
ing for. a contest. Delaney says one man
is likely to tell Jim that his already su
i perb condition would be Improved If he
tooK hot baths right after meals; another
1 might suggest that he partake of pate
!de fol gras at every meal and other
| follows will give Just as worthless aa-
I vice. The veteran trainer . has a great
deal of confidence In Jeffries' wtsdom and
fees! certain that he would laugh at any
suggestion that did not come from his
; handler, but he wants to avoid all this
nuisance by keeping the champion here
until a few days before the content. Jef
! fries seem* to take Delaney's view of
i the case and It is very probable that he
will acQUlesc. -
Jeffries has received the gloves that he
win us*- in his contest with Ruhlin. They
are five ounce and are made of the best
I material. - Sol Levlson of Ban Francisco,,
who has . fitted Jim with mitts for every
battle he has had. sent two rets to the
champion. They fit him to a nicety.
; Jeff Resumes Work To-Day.
Delaney watched the bis; fellow in the
gymnasium and was greatly pleased with
j tits condition. The champion showed
wonderful speed at handball. He played
; three fast games and won them all. Jeff
I next donned the gloves with Armstrong
I and boxed . four hot rounds. They did
not do any love-tapping. Jeffries sailed*
' into the big colored boxer and had me
j latter pinned to the wall In every round.
! Lob landed some stlrt punches to let
I Jim know that he was In the game. Jef-
I fries, without taking a rest, tried out
brother Jack. He spcred Jack's feelings
and did nothing but block and side-step
during the bout. Near the close ho let
Jack go at him hammer nnd tongs and
it never bothered the champion a particle.
Champion in Fine Condition.
Jeff seemed to be fresh and willing to
: do more work. He tossed the heavy mcd
: icine ball with Armstrong, skipped the
! rope, and then tried the rowing machine.
. After a good rub-down he said he felt in
> grand condition. He told Delaney that his
; wind was fine, and that he felt as strong
; as a bull. This statement wan borne out
by. tho amount of work he did without
turning a hair.
Armstrong Is the hardest man In camp
to awaken In the morning. The crowing

B-â ETTING on the Jeffries-Ruhlln j
fight has been at a standstill for i
the last three or four days. The I
men who count on form are ;
guessing which end Is best to j
buy. Jeffries, at Corbetfs poolrooms, is |
the favorite, the prevailing odds being
about 2 to 5. But little money is being I
placed at present.
Interest of the bettors seems to center |
about the contest for Mayor and other ;
municipal officers. No heavy plunging Is i
being done on the big prizefight, but lo- I
cal representatives of the money risking
class are awaiting the coming of the
money that Ik said to be behind the Ak- ;
ron giant. It Is said that the California
sports are ready to back Jeffries with all
kinds of money, provided they cash in at
a result of the election. The fight guesb
ers are still at sea, but will not risk their I
money until the last days of training.
At the various poolrooms in the city
the fight for the time being is exciting
but little Interest. Both men are pretty
well in shape. It is hoped that Jeffries '
will come near the city for the last few
days needed for his training, so that a
line may be had on his condition.
Jeffries, in this contest, has kept him
self away from all entanglements and has
preferred the sec-Fuslon of a distant sum
mer resort to a place more accessible to
the sporting fraternity. While his com- i
Ing competitor Is near the bayshore. Jef
fries is making sporting sharps levy on
the telegraph wires for information as to
his actua! condition.
BURNED AT THE STAKE
AT THE SCENE OF CRIME
Avengers Give Short Shrift to a
Negro Assailant in Missis
sippi.
GULFPORT. Miss., Nov. 4.â A negro,
whose name has not yet been learned,
was burned at the stake In Perry County.
Mississippi, Saturday night. The crime
for which the negro was burned was com
mitted early in the morning, and Mrs.
Fortenbury was the victim. She was the
wife of one cf the most prominent citizens
in that community and was beaten Into
Insensibility by the negro. After recovvr
ering consciousness and while almost too
weak to move she began crying for help.
When assistance reached her she told
the story of the crime and described the
negro. A posse was organised and the
negro answering the description given by
Mrs. Fortenbury was caught and identi
fied by her. She stated positively that he
was the man who had committed the
crime. The negro then made a confes
sion, telling all the details he had pre
viously denied.
An informal court was oganlzed by 1 the
members of the posse. The trial resulted
in a decision to burn the negro, who was
carried from the house to the exact scene
of his crime and there burned at the
stake.
WILLIAM S. FULLER
ARRESTED IN SEATTLE
SEATTLE. Wash. Nov. 4â William S.
Fuller, an alleged fugitive from justice,
was arrested on Occidental avenue to-day
by Detective Phillips, on information
from San Francisco, where he in wanted
for the alleged uupropriation of money
belonging to the standard Oil Company.
Fuller was formerly a special agent of the
company, unU alter he was discharged a
shortage of 1310 is said to have been dis
covered in his accounts. The fact was
reported by his employers to a bonding
company which went his ...evurity. but be
fore the latter made any move for his
apprehension Fuller left San FrancUcu
for this city.
He was taken before Justice Cann and
committed under 11000 bonds to await ISM
arrival of an officer from Sun Francisco.
Captain of Detectives Seymour says he
knows nothing of Fuller. He has advised
the officers at Seattle to hold him unÂ£i'. he
can ascertain the facts about his chj*.
him to the strenuous life that he is lead-
Ing Is a scheme adapted by Jeffries. The
champion has rigged up a heavy cowbell,
which he has wired beneath Bob's couch.
Every morning at 7 o'clock Jim pulls a
rope and the bell clangs as loudly as a
cathedral chime. Armstrong tried to foil
Jeff yesterday morning by dropping the
window down on the rope used to set the
sleep-disturber In motion, but the champ
lon gave one strong pull and nearly dis
located the window sash.
Interest in the Jeffries-Ruhlln contest
was totally obscured last night by the
three-cornered fight between the candi
dates for Mayor. Many people thought
there was easy money In slgM and
plunked to their heart's content. Match
maker Kennedy and Referee Corbett were
so busy looking up bettors that they haa
no time to talk nitht.
Reports from the training quarters of
each of the selected candidates indicate
that both of the pugilists are ready to
fight the battle of their lives.
a IS RUHLIN is in better shape
for the coming championship
fight than he ever was for any
battle for which he has trained
during his long experience as x
prizefighter. Favorable circumstances
have combined to make the Akron flgVer
a marvelous specimen of the finely trained
athlete. His rapid strides into the cham
pionship class have given him an ambiÂ»
tion and liking for his training and he
has rounded into a veritable tower of
strength. Then again Ruhlin Is Just at
that age now when a man usually reaches
the pinnacle of his physical greatness and
every Indication goes to strengthen the
statement of hiÂ» manager. Billy Madden,
who says that Gus is now ready to make
the supreme fistic effort of his life. Grad
ual training for a period of more than two
months* coupled with a good foundation
of strength and agility to start on. has
brought Ruhlin to a stage where he will
either win or lose on his merits as a.
boxer.
Bad condition or physical defection ot
any kind cannot be offered as an excuse
If he loses or give color to a statement
that he could have polished the champion
off in quicker time If he wins. From thÂ«
tip of his toes to the top of his head Ruh
lin is as fine a physical specimen as he
will ever be.
Ruhlin Believes Himself a Winner.
Gus himself says he is in so much finer
fettle than ever he was before that he
can actually feel the Improvement In the
merest trivialities of his preparatory
work. And Gus honestly believes that he
will come out of the mill with flying
colors. â¢
"Kver since I fought Jeffries m this city
I have always felt that he was one fel-
W j '5 thls business that I can trim."
said Ruhlin yesterday after his morning
spin to the Sierra Point House. 'You
know when you once fight a man you can
easily judge whether you are his master
or he yours. Of course, there are many
things that may break down this logic
but as far as the fighter is personally con
cerned he has a well defined feeling one
way or the other. I am going into this
battle to win and I can honestly say thai
I would sooner fight Jeffries than almost
anybody in our class. I'll wager thar I
am stronger and quicker and cleverer
than Jeff. 1 think I can take him out on
the road and run him to death or work
him all out in the gymnasium and I'm
going to try to show the people that 1
can master him in the ring."

Ruhlin work for four days until yestei
day. He was in town nearly every day last
week attending to the many details of ih ?
dJk fight, and when he came back to ihc
! training quarters he was naturally % bit
concerned over the condition of his man.
Working: His Hardest.
Madden went into the gymnasium when
o us came off the road and supervised the
tubbing down process. He looked his as
pirant for Jeffs laurels over from head o
foot, and told Gus that he never saw him
looking better. In the afternoon Ruhlin

I stead of going at it in nis customar Â¦

; made the afternoor/tralnlng a retnaruu

critically embittered the situation.
DEL CASSE'S POLICY UTHELP.
French Deputies Vote to Sustain the
Government's Stand.
PARIS. Nov. 4.â ln the Chamber of
Deputies to-day M. Sembat, Radical-So
cialist, Interpellated the Government on
the Franco-Turkish dispute, criticizing
tho action taken as being for a material
end and contending that France ought to
have Intervened at the time of the Ar
menian massacres.
The Foreign Minister, M. Delcasse, re
plied that France's patience was exhaust
ed by the Porte's breaking its own prom
ises. France, in the present difficulty,
pursued no fresh advantage, but every
body would agree that this present action
on the part of France ought to be justified
by the unjust treatment of which F.rench
workers in the Orient, scholastic and In
dustrial enterprise, had been the subject.
He added:
"Unless Parliament arrests our action
the Government wishes to show that
France, after exemplary patience, has
other things to oppose to the long and
persistent refusals to do justice than
simple observations. The Government in
tervened In the quays question In order
to get Turkey to fulfill her engagements.
If the Government had not done so there
would have been an end to the numerous
enterprises which France had created In

Sultan Always Slippery.
"The Porte has also persisted In Us refu
sal fo reimburse MM. Tublnl and Lorando
- in spite of the decrees of the tribunals In
| their flavor. The Government will only
I present to the Porte demands which are
;in conformity with Its conscience and
i which can lÂ»e sustained In perfect tran
| quillity of mind before the whole world.
I The wbl has been reduced by a large per
Â¦ centage and the Porte In August aj?re.d
ti> rlvp satisfaction, but on the morrow
; these arrangements were forgotten and
others were proposed. Our Minister then
: ceased official relations with the Porte.
I There was no ultimatum, but the cesna
; tlon of relations Indicated that the QovÂ«
: frnment took the Forte's words seriously
and that it Intended that the engagements
i entered into should be respected, but re
served to itself fixing the moment for
: their execution.
"Our rights are certain and nobody will
dispute them. Our action is legitimate
; and nobody can take umbrage at It. and
Â¦ hu our patience has been long so our ac
i tlon must be more resolute."
As to Armenia, M. Delcasse said that
during the past three years he had not
I overlooked the question and while defend
ing France's material Interests, he hau
displayed eoual solicitude for her moral
. Interests and for her traditions.
Protection of Christians.
M. Delcasse said also that the appear
, ance of French cruisers off the Turkish
coast had several times proved that
France had not forgotten the protection
; she owed to Christians and the Taller un
: derstood this. It was true that the re
| forms promised the Armenians had not
been executed; that the Armenians had
' too often been the victims of unpunished
outrages and that oppression also reigned
In Macedonia and In old Servia. The
French Government had put forth every
effort to restore peace, but France was
i not alone bound by the treaty of Berlin.
i The Chamber could rest assured that the
: Government would never forget Its duty
> to humanity. But It must first of all
remember Its duty tn France.
The Foreign Minister's statement was
greeted with applause.
M. Sembat was not satisfied with M
PHcanse's statement and moved that thp
Chamber, convinced that Franco would
fall In her duty If she did not protect the
Armenians In an effectual manner, resolve
] that the Government facilitate this pro
tection by an agreement between the
I powers.
Government Is Sustained.
The President, M. Waldock-Rousseau
j then rose and said that M. Delcasse'H
! declarations showed that the Oovern
| ment's task was heavy and complicated
; As the Government desired respect for the
: tnternts of its fellow citizens, so it in
. tended to defend the patrimony of moral
Interests devolving upon France. It
needed the confidence of the Chamber In
l order to accomplish ks task.
M. Bembat'n motion was rejected by 394
Ito 64 votes. M. Castlnet then moved that
; the Chamber, confident that the Govern -
; ment would enforce respect for the inter
i ests and honor of France, pass to the or
der of the day.
The Chamber then, by 306 to 77, voted
nuHUlnlng the Government's action toward
| Turkey and expressed confidence in the
i Government.
APPEALS TO GREAT BRITAIN.
Turkey Asks That Terms of Old
Treaty Be Carried Out.
PARIS, Nov. 4.â "The Porte has asked
Great Britain," says the Constantinople
correspondent of the Echo de Paris, "to
fulfill the tormit of the convention of 1878,
whereby In exchange for the Island of
Cyprus, Great Britain guaranteed the In
tegrity of the Sultan's Asiatic poMsesalons.
"The Porte holds that under this con
vention Great Britain should protect
Asiatic. Turkey against attack by France,
and suggests that Great Britain should
send a squadron to the Levant for that
purpose."

pug dog has the sympathy of the dog.
LOW LEADING
IN NEW YORK
Fusion Candidate for
Mayor the Favorite
Among Bettors.
Tammany Leaders Claim Vic
tory, and Election May
Be Very Close.
NEW YORK, Nov. 4.-At midnight to
nightâsix hours before the opening of the
pollsâ sides In the municipal contest
were claiming the victory. The most
strenuous talk came from the fusion lead
ers, who were more in evidence at their
headquarters than were the Democrats at
theirs, the latter, after the distribution of
campaign funds in the afternoon, having
hurried to their several election precincts
to give their last orders to their followers.
John* A. Mason 'of the Shepard head
quarters said he felt confident of the re
sult and placed the Democratic candi
date's majority at 40,000. . ' â '
During the late afternoon Seth Low, thÂ«
fusion candidate, at his own headquarters
said: . Â¦ . -
"1 . think things could not look more
rosy,'.' and addeu: "This has been a most
Interesting campaign. The tight is over
and, no matter who "is elected, 1 am sure
tne city will profit by the . agitation of
the questions. which have been the main
Is. ues of the campaign."
â¢ Robert C. Morris, chairman of the Re
publican campaign committee, stuck to
nis estimate of 70.000 for Low. â > . .
Kdward M. Shepard said this evening
that In.- had no particular , statement to
make and nothing to Bay of the cam
paign beyond what he had already, said,
ana no issues to discuss further man ht
had already discussed them.
If the betting upon the result Is any I
indication as to what the count of ballots
will show, the fusion candidates seem to
have the better of it by a shade. Late
to-night wagers were laid at 10 to 7 on !
Low and the rest of the city ticket. There
is not the same confidence upon the fu
sion side as to the county ticket, and
predictions are made that all the candi
dates upon the Democratic county ticket
in New York County will be elected, with
tne possible exception of Robert A. Van
Â¦\Vyck for Justice of the Supreme Court,
who has had to bear the orunt of the
attack, and Henry W. TJnger, for District
Attorney. Possibly on account of the
whirlwind campaign he nas made, Wil- ;
liam Travers Jerome, fusion candidate for Â¦
District Attorney, was getting the benefit ;
of predictions mat he woula run ahead
of his ticket, but the betting odds favored
Unger.
Croker Is Confident. - '
Richard Croker and John F. Carroll late
to-night were positive of the election of
the entire Democratic city and county
tickets. Mr. CrokÂ«r also declared that
Kings County would go Democratic, while
Lieutenant Governor Woodruff and Otto
Kcmptner talked of 10.00U and 25.000 re
spectively for the fusion candidates in
tnat county. Those estimates upon the
Brooklyn vote' were the one discouraging
feature In the fusion camp. The biggest
estimates made by the fuslonlsts uro
based on a 250.000 majority for the fusion
ticket iii Brooklyn. None of the fusion
leaders agree upon the majority that the
ticket will have In Manhattan and the
Bronx.
At the Democratic Club to-night Brook
lyn was claimed for Shepard and the
Democratic ticket by r* 300U majority.
Queens County was claimed by 1500 ma
jority and Richmond" by loot), making the
total majority claimed by the Democrats
at the Democratic Club of : 49.733. j
Notwithstanding the claims of the
Democrats and those of the fuslonlsts.
the election will likely be a very close
one. Hot h sides are â¢ counting upon the
Independent, voters. .' -fi #-
fiuperint?nu>nt*of Elections McCullagh
addressed another letter to-day to Police
Commissioner Murphy, In which he furn
ished a long list of election precincts In
which he asserted frauds would be at

the State deputies made arrests to-mor
row the persons arrested would be turned
over to the policemen at the polls and
Murphy was requested In the letter to is
sue orders to the police to at once take,
such prisoners to the nearest magistrate.
There was a feeling of- fear to-night that
before election day was over there would
be frequent clashes between the St.m
deputies and the police. Â¦

BT. LOUIB. Nov. 4.-Harry Forbes of
Chicago received the decision to-night
over Abe Attell of San Francisco at the
end of the fifteenth round of fast milling
at the West End Club. The bout was one
of the very best seen here In a number of
years. The fortunes of war shifted from
one principal to another throughout, and
It was only Forbes' superior strength that
finally brought him victory In the cloning
(stages. Attell had Forbes all but out In
the second round, forcing the Chicago
boy to take the count. The Callfnrnlnn
weakened under heavy punishment
toward the close of the fight, the bell
saving him on two or three occasions
The boys fought at 116 pounds.

SCHLEY MAKES HIS CASE CLEAR
TO THE NAVAL COURT OF INQUIRY
Hero of the Great Sea Battle Off Santiago Takes Witness-
Stand to Correct and Explain Certain Discrepancies
in His Former Testimony â Argument Commences
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4.-The
Schley court of Inquiry reach
ed the argument stage at the
beginning of the afternoon ses
sion to-day. The* morning sit-*
ting was devoted to listening to Admiral
Schley and Captain Sigsbee in making
corrections of their testimony, which had
been given previously, and the Introduc
tion by Judge Advocate Lemly of numer
ous documents bearing upon different
phases of the inquiry. Admiral Schley did
not make any material additions to his
previous statements, but devoted himself
largely to the clearing up' of ambiguous
points In his evidence. An effort was
made to Introduce two new witnesses,
who were expected to give testimony In
Admiral Schley's behalf concerning the
controversy as to what Captain Sigsbee
communicated to Admiral Schley when he
arrived off Santiago in May, 1898. One of
these witnesses was Frank B. Richards
and the other George Lynch, both of New
York, and both newspaper correspondents
who were on duty In Cuba and in Cuban
waters during the war with Spain.
Lynch was on the press boat Somers N.
Smith and Richards on the Premier.
They were to have testified concerning the
meeting of these vessels with the St. Paul,
of which Captain Slgsboe was In com
mand. The court decided, however, not to
hear them.
The opening speech of the argument In
the case was made on behalf of the Gov
ernment by E. P. Hanna, assistant to the
judge advocate. He began his presenta
tion of the case a few minutes after the
court convened at 2 o'clock and when the
court adjourned, two hours later, he had
not covered more than half of the ground
covered In the controversy.
Documentary Evidence.
Captain Lemly submitted for the con
sideration of the court a large mass of
documentary evidence. Including Captain
Goodrlch's report concerning cable cutting
made on April 29. 189S; the reports made
by Capttaln Philip of the Texas, Captain
Hlgginson of the Massachusetts, Captain
McCalla of the Marblehead and Captain
Cotton of the Harvard. Commodore
Schley's report of May 80, Captain Wise's
report of the operations of the Yale off
Santiago, the log of the Spanish ship Cris
tobal Colon, Admiral Sampson's order to
Captain Folger of the Scorpion, all the re
ports of the commanding officers of the
battle of July S. Commodore Schley's let
ter to the Senate, one of Captain Sigs
bee's letters and also the letter of the Sec
retary of the Navy to the Senate.
The first witness to take the stand to
day was Captain Blgsbee. who was re
called for the purpose of . correcting his
former testimony. While he was on the
stand Raynor asked him If he had mega
phoned or otherwise communicated to the
press boat Premier, while off Santiago,
the fact that the Spanish fleet was not In
Santiago. The witness replied that he had
not done so, although ho would have been
Justified In saying so If he had thought It
proper under the circumstances of war.
When Captain Sigsbee was excused Cap
tain I<emly announced that he had no
more witnesses to call.
Frank B. Richards was then sworn.
Richards stated that he was on the dis
patch boat Premier during the Santiago
campaign and that the boat was hailed by
Captain Slgsbce on the night of May 27
or Ma y 28.
Lemly's Objection Sustained.
At this point Captain Lemly objected to
this line of evidence on the ground that
commodore Schley was not present dur
ing the conversation, also that it was not
material to the Issue.
Raynor claimed that this alleged con
versation with Captain Sigsbee was one of
the vital points of the case. That It bears
directly upon one of tne most Important
specifications of the precept. Raynor said
he did not desire to impeach the credibil
ity of Captain Sigsbee. but would en
deavor to Impeach his recollection.
After a short argument by Hanna In
support of Captain Lemly's objection the
court retired to consider the point raised.
The court was absent but a short time.
Whon It returned Admiral Dewey an
nounced that "as the testimony of this
witness Is not considered material to the
case, the objection was sustained in ac
cordance with the court's previous rul-
Onder this ruling neither Richards nor
Lynch sould testify and Admiral Schley
took the stand for the purpose of correct
ing hIM testimony.
The admiral was suffering from a severe
cold and his voice was quite hoarse. He
began his corrections at the very first of
his testimony. Most of these corrections
were of typographical errors or the
c
changing of words to make sentence* read
more smoothly.
In referring to his testimony regarding
the arrival of the Hartford on May 27 with
a dispatch from the Secretary of the Navy
Informing him that "all of the depart
ment's information Indicated the presence
of the Spanish squadron at Santiago."
which dispatch, he had declared, had
never reached him and therefore he had
never seen it or heard of It until recently.
Admiral Schley corrected this portion of
his testimony by stating that neither his
flag lieutenant nor his secretary had ever
seen the dispatch nor remembered It. He
had previously included his first lieuten
ant in this statement.
Schley Changes Statement.
Referring to his testimony rfgarding
the reconnoissance of May 31, the admiral
changed his rtatrment that "fifty if not
more shells passed over the fleet" to read
that a "number of shells passed over the
fleet." He also changed his evidence con
cerning suspicious movements in Santiago
harbor on July 2 to read that "before
dark I noticed In the harbor a good deal
of smoke coming up." The official rec
ord, he said, made him say that he saw
the smoke after dark.
Coming to his answer to a question In
reference to an order sent below during
the early part of the battle "to stand by
to ram," Admiral Schley emphasized his
former testimony by stating that "there
was a distinct intention to ram on the
part of the Maria Teresa. Admiral Cer
vera's flagship, and the Vlscaya."
He also reiterated his confidence in the
Brooklyn's speed by stating "with one
engine and all the boiler power" she could
have gotten up all speed that was need
ed. As to the passage of the flying squad
ron by the Eagle on May 19 and the lat
ter conveying the Information that "there
was no news." Admiral Schley corrected
his testimony wherein he said he was not
mistaken as to this by stating that ha
might have been mistaken.
Admiral Schley also corrected his state
ment regarding his visit to the flagship
New York, when he had made his pre
liminary report of the battle of July 3 to
Admiral Sampson. The record, he said,
did not make the matter quite clear.
"The admiral said to me that 1 had omit
ted a very Important detail, which was to
state that the New York was present."
The witness corrected but one of the an
swers. This question was to the effect
that as he was ordered to go to Clenfue
gos to establish a blockade, was it not
his duty to communicate alrectly and by
signal or otherwise with the senior offi
cers of the vessels returning from Clen
fucgos and obtain from them full Infor
mation regarding the situation at or near
that port? The answer as corrected
reads: "The communication which he
made to me through the Eagle Indicated
that Captain McCalla knew I was bound
for plenfuegos. and I. of course, took It
for (ranted If he had had anything Im
portant he would have notified me of the
fact without any Inquiry."
No More Corrections.
At this point Admiral Schley announced
that he had no more corrections to make*,
when Captain Parker called his attention
to the evidence of Captain Sigsbee. in
whtch he had said that when he went on
hoard the Brooklyn the whole question,
mo far as he could remember, was coal,
and nothing but coal, and that Commo
dore Schley had already made up his
mind to go to Key West.
"That was not the first question Sigs
bee asked me at all," replied Admiral
Schley. "I did not say to Captain Sigs
bee that we were going to Key West, as
the signal will show. Sigsbee was talking
on the subject .of coal, and since he men
tions it, I recall the fact that, his state
ment was that he was commanding a
vensel that was one-tenth of a mile long
and that she could not turn her engines
over unless ISO tons of a coal a day were
used: that ho would have to go to Key
West."
"Had you. as a matter of fact, mad*, up
your mind at that time to go to Key
West?" *
"I had not."
Admiral Schley then referred to his con
versation with Admiral Sampson regard-
Ing his Instructions about not bombard
ing fortifications as follows:
a l ought to mention. In connection with
SAMPSON'S ATTORNEY. WHO IS
SAID TO HAVE AIDED LEMLY
IN PREPARING QUESTIONS.
the talk I had with the admiral In rela
tion to his instructions about not bom
barding fortifications, that I recall the
fact that he and I were talking about -
the guns that were probably there, anil
I asked him whether he knew If they
were Honturia or Krupp guns. He said.
'Probably both.' and that recalls the cir
cumstances to me. And. again. In rela
tion^ to the testimony of Lieutenant Roys
Judge advocateâ l do not think the pur
pose of calling the witness to revise hfcÂ»
testimony is to enable him to contradict
witnesses who have been on the stand.
. Counsel Become Riled.
Raynorâ He can contradict any witness
If we want him to do It. This is a re
markable statement, if your witnesses
have a right to rebut ours and we have
not a right to answer them. Mr. Roys
was an entirely new witness.
The Judge advocateâ l think as Lieuten
ant Roys is the only witness who remain
ed uncontradicted I have no objection to
make. > Â¦ - . Â»
Raynorâ think that is a great mistake.'
that he Is the only witness uncontradict
ed. I think there are fifty witnesses un
contradicted. according to my recollec
tion. That Is a highly improper remark,
for the judge advocate to make.
The judge advocateâ lf the court please.
I Â¦am to be corrected by the court - only
and not by counsel, who has 'frequently
attempted It.
~ Raynorâ suggest, may It please, the
court, that during the trial of this case
it is highly improper and objectionable
for - the judge advocate to say . that this
Is the only witness that Is uncontradicted.
! It Is objectionable because it is not a
fact, That remark means to say that
Commodore Schley has contradicted every
witness on the stand. It is highly im
proper, highly objectionable.

jection to the admiral's reference to Lieu- .
tenant Roys. ....... â . .
Admiral Schleyâ l merely wanted to say
I am quite sure that Lieutenant Roys
was mistaken. .â¢,-â¢Â¦ "
Admiral BchlÂ«r was than finally excused and
Captain Lemly offered a large number of doc- -
uments In evidence. . Among this documentary
evidence .was a letter of the Secretary of thÂ»
Navy: to the President, dated February *. ISM.
In response to the Senate resolution of January
23. 1399, submitting fact* affecting thÂ» proposal
that certain officers be advanced. Â¦ The propo
sition of Captain Lemly to Introduce this letter -
a evidence occasioned considerable discussion.
Raynor objecting to any ex-part.- statements
be in* made a part of the record. It was anally
decided that the letter should not go Into thd
printed record In the case, but that It may to

Â¦ When the court convened after recess. Admi
ral Dewey handed to Captain Lemly. *n<! th*
latter read the following: â¢ , : - - â¢
"The court states that while it has admitted

sel for the applicant which was Issued to the
applicant by the President of the United States
on August 10. IS3B. the court does* net recognize 1
such document as the commission under which

presentation of the case by referring to the
fact that In May.. VSSB. the coast or the United

CO-OPERATION AND PROFIT
SHARING.
MANY schemes for the solution of the prob
lem of labor and capital have been devised
One that promised much was organized by
Mr. Dolgre at Dolgeville, New York. He was a suc
cessful manufacturer of piano felt, and extended his
operations to the production of all sorts of felt goods.
He had benevolent purposes and some socialistic
ideas, an.l carried out both by instituting profit-shar
ing tor the benefit of his workmen. He housed them
comfortably, furnished schools, a library, and intel
lectual amusements, and made himself the friend and
companion of the workmen whom he made partners
in his business by dividing profit; with them
All went well as long as there were profits to di
vide, but when there were losses to divide a change
came. Mr. Dolge was surprised to find that profit
sharing was one thing and loss-sharing another. Had
he paid wages only and kept all the profits, when hard
times came he could have drawn on the accumula
tion to keep work and wages going. But there were
no accumulations, and after a pitiful struggle he
failed, and is to-day a poor man, and has come to
California to end his days.
His experiment was widely cited as a solution of
the labor problem, but it failed, because his own be
nevolence and unselfishness were not shared by those
who shared his profits. It is probable that, after all,
men prefer independence to that reliance on the
good will and benevolence of another which means
dependence in some form. As far as Dolge's ex
perience goes it seems to indicate that men prefer the
old way, which means that the fittest, the most in
dustrious and thriftiest will go forward and become
independent by their own exertions, while those who
lack those qualities will stand still and die in their
tracks. Most of the social reforms seem to mean
that the grand scheme of society shall be in the in
terest of the latter class, sacrificing for its benefit the
individual ambition, enterprise and progressive spirit
of the former.
Another scheme that has been often tried is the
co-operation colony. It is not generally known that
such a colony of white people was formed and planted
in Hawaii to demonstrate that white labor could
work in the cane fields and make for itself a foothold
in the tropics by an industry for which it had been
thought unfit.
; Fourteen colonists were settled on the Ewa planta
tion, on the very best of cane land. They made $40
a month, with free house rent. fuel, water, garden,
schools, a train to carry the children to school and a
physician free of cost. Yet only five of the number
remained until the first crop of cane matured Then
they all left but two, and these, when the second crop
of cane matured, refused to cither strip, cut or load
the cane, and Japanese labor had to be called in to
save the crop. They had no complaint to make about
the land or any of the conditions. Five of them were
married men. The fitst man to quit left after one
morttli in the colony because his wife disliked the
quiet life. The next quit because his wife died. The
third withdrew because he quarreled with a brother
colonist. The fourth was ill, and then when the
cane was ready to cut five of the single men deserted
in a body, surrendering the profit they had in the
season* work. Of the five left two were aged, one
middle-aged, and two were boys. When the second
crop was milled they took their share of the profits
and quit.
Xone seemed lacking in industry, but they chafed
under the dependence of co-operation and disliked the
work and the climate. It is believed that this ends
not only white colony experiments in the islands, but
also the hope of using white labor on the sugar
plantations, and brings in sight a crisis in the labor
situation of Hawaii.
.;. ; Now. hat is one to conclude from the lesson of
DolgeviHc and Ewa? Is it fair to conclude in both
caws thai artificial were substituted for natural condi
tions, and failed? Is it fair to conclude that men pre
fer to work out their own salvation, earn and keep
their own wages and profits, and to squander or in
â¢M then as they please, rather than co-operate with
other?, or become the beneficiaries of the benevolent
pl?ns and oversight of an employer?
TO-DAY'S IDHSOISIO3ST.
WE have fairly, frankly and dispassionately dealt with the issues involved in to
day's election. We have desired to save the city from the danger and disas
ter of a class government, and were convinced that this must be done by
plumping votes for the more eligible of the regular candidates for the office
of Mayor. Mr. Wells, early in the campaign, put himself off the eligible list in the esti
mation of all'men who have the city's interest most at heart. From a bad start he made
a worse run every day, and as the close of the campaign came in sight it was apparent
that only by such a miracle as does not happen in politics could he hope to win. He and
the class candidate represent equally undesirable elements that should not get influence in
the municipal government. The city was between them as between two fires, and the
only way out was obviously in the election of Mr. Tobin. It is evident now that this
way will be taken, and the city, escaping from danger, will pass on through safety to that
prosperity which is always related to good and upright government. The issue has not
been partisan. Xo party principle is at stake and no party gains or loses in the larger and
legitimate political field by the result.
City government is a business entirely. It can gain nothing by mixing national
politics with it. Let the independent voters and the high principled Republicans in this
city look at Greater New York. There the Republicans, independent Democrats and
various citizens' leagues are all combined in supporting Seth Low for Mayor, not be
cause Seth Low is a Republican, but because his candidacy promises to redeem the
metropolis of the continent from misrule and government so bad that it is a stench. No
Democrat who supports Low sacrifices his party convictions. Thousands have rallied, to
him in opposition to the Tammany ticket of their own party. New York is Democratic
city, and Low's election will leave it unmoved in its standing as such. But the city has
suffered in every way by making national politics a controlling force in the election of
its government. Intelligent Democrats see this, just as intelligent Republicans here see
the same thing. Mr. Wells has persistently appealed to Republicans, as if party interests
were at stake in his election. They are really at stake in his defeat and will be advanced
and strengthened by that result.
Mr. Tobin. who will be elected, takes this sane and sensible view of the issue
when he says: "I love my native city, and it would be, a sufficient reward for all my
labors in her behalf however humble or weak, if I could feel that they contributed in
any degree to the welfare of her citizens or her permanent improvement. I would enter
upon the office not as a partisan, but as a servant of the whole people, determined to do
my duty to the whole people, as God gives me light to see it." That is the proper spirit
in which to seek and accept the responsibilities of municipal government. It rises into
the higher atmosphere and cuts all connection with party politics. If we get one strong
and clean city administration moved by that spirit, the people will wonder that party
politics was ever appealed to in a city election.
The election of Mr. Tobin will make it forever impossible to threaten the city
with class rule on one side or boss rule on the other. If the contest were between
Schmitz and Wells the people would have no choice. We count it fortunate for San
Francisco that the nomination of Mr. Tobin was made, however unwillingly by some of
the element* that wanted a partisan on that side, since it has furnished the opportunity
to repudiate class and boss, and send them to associate in the limbo of the rejected and
repudiated.
It is to be hoped that New York will be equally wise and in to-day's election will
do the same for that long suffering city, so that the great cities of the two coasts can
set an example for the relief of all the misruled municipalities that lie between.
BULLER AS A HERO.
ONE of the salient traits of British character
was shown in the treatment or mistreatment
of Lord Roberts by the crowd at the cere
monies attending the reception given the Duke of
York on his return to London The man who but a
short time ago *as the popular idol of his country
was roundly hissed and hooted as he rode along in
the royal procession Nor was there any doubt in
the minds of the observers as to the cause of the
change in public sentiment Roberts was hooted be
cause the British masses have become persuaded that
he has been unjust to Buller
It is doubtful if any other race in the world would
like a general of Bullc's type He has a bulldog's
courage, but hardly more than a bulldog's sense.
His career in command in South Africa was one long
list of blunders and disasters In battle after battle
he was defeated, and up to the time Roberts arrived
Buller had accomplished nothing for the relief of
Ladysmith or Mafeking About the only thing in
the man to be admired was his hearty, bluff way of
taking defeat and standing up against it without
whining.
The courage of the man and his willingness to bear
all the blame of whatever happened to the army
under his command was shown- in the dispatch to Sir
George White in which he suggested to that officer
that it might be advisable to surrender Ladysmith.
It was Buller's frank announcement that he had
written such a dispatch that led to his retirement from
the army, and yet the incident appears to be decidedly
to his credit
Buller's statement of the matter is that after his
failure to relieve Ladysmith by his first advance, he
found it necessary to send a message to Sir George
White to the effect that he could not make another
attempt for a month, and that even then relief would
have to come by slow fighting and not by rushing.
He then said: "I was in command; whatever re
sponsibility there was there was mine, and I thought,
'Ought I not to give him some help, some lead, and
something which, if it came to the last absolute mo
ment, would have enabled him to say, ' "Well, after
all. I have Sir Redvers Buller's, as my commander,
opinion in favor of this'" ' Therefore I put into the
middle of a telegram a sentence in which I suggested,
if it would be necessary to abandon, to surrender, the
garrison, what he should do when he surrendered,
and how he should do it I put that in simply because,
if he ever had to give up, it might be some sort of
cover to a man who, 1 thought, was in much greater
difficulty than I was myself."
This willingness on the part of Buller to stand by
a brother officer who was in greater difficulties than
himself shows a trait of character that helps us to
understand why the British public persists in liking
him despite all his blunders and the disasters that re
sulted from them It is very seldom that soldiers
havr been intrusted to the command of a less com
petent general, or that more serious defeats have be
fallen brave men by reason of bad generalship. All
of that is well known to the British masses, but they
like the old general because he is a brave fellow, and
â¢Â¦rands by hi? friends. Ho is not much of a hero, but
it mn<-f hr confessed that there have been worse.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1901.
SENATOR TILLMAN'S DEFENSE.
SENATOR TILLMAN has been so often cited
as the outspoken advocate of lynch law that a
Boston man recently wrote to him and inclosed
a sermon against lynching, preached by the Rev.
Quincy Ewing of Mississippi and published in the
Boston Herald. In his letter the writer said: "In
it you will find the strongest message about lynching
in the State of Mississippi I ever read, and the com
ment of the Herald was so strong I thought you, as
a public servant, ought to see it for the good of the
negro if not for your own."
In reply Senator Tillrnan sets forth his defense in
these words: "I have read the sermon of Mr. Ewing
and the editorial of the Herald. 1 am not responsible
because the Associated Press sent out garbled and
distorted reports of my lecture at Marinette, Wis.,
creating the impression that I was an advocate of
lynch law. I have said more than once, and expect
to stand by it, that lynching for rape is justifiable.
So far as other lynchings are concerned, no public
man in the South has such a record as I have. Dur
ing my term as Governor I made the most strenuous
efforts to prevent lynching in this State, and appealed
to the race pride and sense of justice of my fellow
citirens to give the negroes a fair trial and punish
ment according to law. In the constitutional conven
tion of '95 I introduced and had incorporated a pro
vision giving the relatives or legatees of any person
lynched exemplary damages against the county in
which it occurred in the sum of $2000; also a pro
vision removing from office any Sheriff who allowed
a prisoner to be lynched while in his custody. But I
see the rising storm in increase of crime among ne
groes, especially the crime against white women, and
it appears inevitable that drastic measures wijl have
to be resorted to in the near future or there will be
a race conflict causing rivers of blood to flow."
Since Senator Tillman has been so extensively criti
cized, it is but right that his defense should be given
a fair hearing. The record which he made for him
self in trying to prevent lynching does him credit,
but it will be noted that the policy he advocates is an
impossible one. He would sanction lynching for one
crime but forbid it in all other instances. That is to
say, he is willing to permit a violation of the law at
some times, but not at others. If, however, violations
of law are to be permitted at all, it is not easy to draw
the line and say where they shall stop. Tillman
would draw the line in one place, other men would
draw it somewhere else, and they have as much right
to fix the line as has the Senator. When a man ad
vocates lynch law at all he opens the door to repeated
violences. There is but one way to uphold the law,
and that is by refusing to sanction a violation of it
upon any ground or for any reason.
The closing sentence of the Senator's letter shows
the alarmist nature of his mind. His cry that drastic
measures will be necessary in dealing with the rising
storm of crime among negroes has no justification in
the situation of the South. Statistics compiled by
people who had no thought of politics or of social
supremacy, but who were concerned solely in gath
ering figures for official reports, show that the negro
in the South is improving in his capacity as a worker,
as a saver of money ?nd as a farmer. The whole
South is prospering. There is, in fact, every reason
to believe that were it not for the agitators and pro
fessional alarmists, who for personal advantage keep
the minds of blacks and whites alike alarmed, the race
question would settle itself in the advancing prosper
ity and industrial and educational uplifting of both
races.
It has been decided by the authorities that while
Earl Russell is a bigamist under British law, he is
not a bigamist under our law. for in this country the
Nevada divorce is valid. Consequently the Earl can
not only come into the country without let or
hindrance, but he has a right to expect to be received
as a man in good social standing and be welcome
everywhere, from the club to the family drawing
room.

A CHANCE TO SMILE
The sexton of a certain country church
usually makes the most of an opportunity,
and Is not above giving what he describes
as "a gentle 'int" to the sightseer.
The other afternoon he had conducted *
party round the church and despite the
casual dropping of more than one "gentle
â¢Int" It appeared as If the sexton was to
go unrewarded.
On the porch the leader of the party
paused a moment, thanked the old sextoa
profusely, and wished him "good after-
I noon."
"I suppose," he added, "you've been
j here many years?"
"Forty, ' replied the old man. "an" its a
1 werry strange thing, as whenever I'm
a-Â»howing a party out o' the church they
allus asks me that question, or' (with.
j emphasis) "the other "n"
i "Indeed." replied the visitor "and what
I may the other question be?"
"What I calls question No t. ' replied
the sexton calmly. "Is Jest this: *SamlwÂ«U.

"SamiwHl " watched the party leave

â¢?Well, father, not exactly." And the

proposed; but. then, last evening, when
we were out walking, we passed by a nlca

Edinburgh Scotsman.
A stipendiary magistrate in a town la
Yorkshire, who was not given to err on
the side of leniency, once had before him
a cab driver who was charged with fu
rious driving. After some severe com
rer.ts on the man's conduct a heavy fine
was imposed.
A few days after the trial the magis
trate, who had been detained longer than
usual In the court, was hurrying to catch
his train, when, seeing an empty cab
handy, he hailed the driver and directed
him to proceed to the station, telling Mm
he was pressed for time.
The driver, however, heedless of tba
hint, kept to a very gentle trot.
"I say. I say, my man." exclaimed tho
fare, with his head out of the window,
"drive faster than this."
"It can't be done, sir." replied the driv
er. "Ye see. If we drives faster we're
had afore the beak and we gets fined, so
we has to be careful."
He did not alter his pace, and neither
did the "beak" catch the train.â Tit-BitÂ».

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 4.â After a
tempestuous voyage of four days tho
steamer Amur, Captain Gosso, arrived
this afternoon from the north. She
brought eighty passengers from Skaguay,
most ot them hailing from the Klondike,
and heHl $W0,Â»0 worth of gold for the
Canadian Bank of Commerce. From
"Wrangel down to Queen Charlotte Sound
the weather was extremely rough and the
steamer had all she could do for a day
and a half to keep above the blue seaa
that continually washed over her bows.
There were more Icebergs than Captain
Gosse has ever seen before on a trip, and
altogether it was about the roughest run
he ever experienced on the northern
route.
Arrivals from Dawson say that there is
ice over the river there every morning,
but it runa out during the day and the
steamers are still able to make headway.
The season Is the latest in several years.
A. B Newall, general manager of the
White Pass Railway, who came down,
says that every pound of freight has been
cleaned up. and the spring will be opened
with the warehouses empty and ready to
take all the cargoes for down-river ports
that can be supplied.
At White Horse the Dawson passengers
were delayed d> a snowstorm, and more
than two feet of snow fell Wednesday

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1901.
BIG RUSH TO GET THE AUSTRALIAN
MAIL AWAY ON OVERLAND EXPRESS
Head Winds and a Heavy Sea Delay Ventura, but She Ar
rives a Few Hours Before Sunset, and Thanks to the
Customs Authorities English Mails Get Away on Time
FLEET OF LAUNCHES THAT WILL BE T'SED BY THE RIBDON IRON WORKS ON THE BAT DURING THE
WINTER. RISDON NO. 3 WAS LAUNCHED THIS MORNING ANls HER BUILDER EXPECTS HER TO
MAKE AT L.EABT TWELVE KNOTS AN HOUR.
THE mall steamship Ventura ar
rived from Australian ports last
night. She was delayed by head
winds and a heavy sea, but man
aged to make port In time to catch
the Eastern mall. The mall boat was re
ported by the Merchants' Exchange out
look at 3 p. m., but it was nearly two
i hours later before she made her dock. In
! the meantime the overland was awalu
1 Ing the mail and no tlma could be
wasted. Captain Olsen, the head steve
: dore, lost no time In getting the gang
Â¦ planks out and live minutes after the ves
sel was alongside the mall was being
: rushed to the ferries. In the meantime
| the passengers were still aboard and It
; was only due to the courtesy of the cus
toms authorities that the mall was land
; cd. It Is now speeding across the conti
. nent and will be In New York In time to
catoh the mall boat for Europe.
There were 464 bags of Eastern and
! European mall on the steamship, so It U
no wonder that there was a rush on the
arrival of the steamship and that the pas
sengers had to wait until the correspond
ence was landed.
The Ventura did not bring up a largo
' cargo, but among it was 48 boxes of bul
: lion, valued at over 1750,000. Her first and

DARK MANTLE
SHROUDS LONDON
Fog Blocks All Traffic
in the British
Capital.
Half of the United Kingdom
Is Also in a Similar
Predicament.
LONDON, Nov. 4.â A fog such as Great
Britain has not experienced for years en
veloped London and half the United
Kingdom to-day, blockading shipping, de
ranging railways and throwing business
In London, Birmingham and other pro
vincial cities Into confusion. So dense
was it that a walk into the streets was
an adventure.
The fog descended upon the metropolis
and the suburbs so thickly that between
4 and 5 o'clock In the afternoon the prin
cipal avenues of traffic resembled the
steam room of a Turkish bath. Hun
dreds of thousands of London's subur
ban population vainly endeavored to
grope their way to the railway stations.
The few who succeeded found the trains
all stalled.
Around Trafalgar Square and the
houses of Parliament scenes unparalleled
for years were witnessed. Hundreds of
omnibuses, cabs, carts and wagons
formed an inextricable Immovable mass.
The mounted police, in trying to clear
away the Jam, got lost themselves. Many
vehicles were in collision. The drivers,
not. knowing where they were, stood at
the heads of their horses, patiently
awaiting the lifting of the premature
darkness.
Lanterns were at a premium, news
boys transformed their papers Into tem
porary torches. highwaymen pursued
their vocation, casualties were frequent
and even hardened Londoners freely ex
pressed a dread of the continuation of
such fogs as those of to-day.
If the tog had not lifted somewhat to
ward night London would have been so
congested that Its housing resources,
commodious as they are, would 'have
been taxed beyond their limits by the
forced accommodation of the fog-bound
suburbanites.
Among children and old people the del
eterious effects of such a continuous and
exceptional fog can scarcely be esti
mated.

Alexander Fairly Well.
Among the arrivals yesterday were
three whalers. They were the steamer*
Karluk, We Baylies and Alexander. The
first named came home clean, while the
Win. Baylies made a good season. The
Alexander took two whales, but the sea
son was over as far as Captain TUton was
concerned when he was taken sick. At
Dutch Harbor it was feared he would die
from abscesa of the Hver, but he pulled
through and yesterday made the follow
ing re]K>rt of the outlook:
The season of 1901 has been a very trying one
to those who are interested In whaling With
but two exceptions the ships engaged In the
Arctic have made barely enough to meet tkeiri
expenses. Owners and crews and underwriters
have suffered also In the loss of the whaling
steamers Balaena and Orarapas, belonging to
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. Tbe past
year has been a very unusual one in many
wayÂ». Not only for the heavy weather of the
fall, which was occasioned by aa almost total
absence of Ire. many of the ships being forced
to cruise so far north that we war* entirely
off the map. and also for tbe entire absence of
whales to the eastward of longitude IS degrees
E0 minutes west, and the total failure of the
Mackenzie River fleet.
The greater part of Arctic whalemen this
year have returned 11k* the average Nome
prosswetor. poor In parse bat rich In expe
riences, and of all countries Alaska Is rich In
experiences. This Is the era, of tbe full dinner
pall, but the majority of the whalemen for the
coming winter will no doubt subsist on the fruit
of any economics they may have been fortunate
enough to have practiced in better days and
trust to the whaleman s mascot, luck, far a
more successful voyage in IMS.

HAWAIIAN GRAND
JURIES AT WORK
Territorial Body Sharply
Criticizes Asylum for
the Insane.
Enemies of Judge Humphreys
to Make a New Move
Against Him,
HONOLULU, Oct. 29â Two Grand Ju
ries have been in session during the past
week.. The Territorial Grand Jury has
finished Its labors and presented a lengthy
report to Judge Gear, in which the Hono
lulu Asylum for the Insane Is very se
verely criticized.
The Federal Grand Jury has been inves
tigating Iwilel, the famous stockade,
where several hundred Japanese women
were gathered together, and il has found
a number of indictments against "own
ers' 1 of the alleged slaves. Though tbe
stockade evstem has been done away
with there are still many women in the
district living tinder much the same cir
cumstances, though no longer with the
consent and protection of the police.
YV. M. Campbell, a contractor, who has
been working ut the new naval wharf un
der Captain Merry on Government work,
has been Indicted by the Federal Grand
Jury tor violating tiie natiouul eight-hour
law. He employed Japenese carpenters
for thÂ« work and is said to have worked
thorn nine nours a uay. The sub-con
tractor, a Japanese numed Ohta, was in
dicted with mm. They are at liberty ou
UW bonds each.
A special meeting of the Hawaiian Bar
Association has been called lor :he pur
pose of receiving and considering the re
port of the committee appointed some
months ago tv formulate charges against
Judge A. S. Humphreys, ilrst Judge of the
First Circuit Court. The charges were
heard at Washington and Humphreys
was sustained by Attorney General Knox
and the President, but the political flghi
Is not over In Hawaii yet, and there are
reports of a new move by the enemies of
the Judge in the bar association.
Circuit Judge Gear yesterday sat heav
ily on an old Hawaiian rule of procedure.
It has been the custom of attorneys here
on securing judgments to submit their
drafts of decrees to opposing counsel for
approval before asking for the Judge's
signature. Judge Gear declared that this
practice was all wrong and did not ob
tain In any other jurisdiction than Ha
waii. The question arose in a foreclosure
case, in which Attorney R. D. Stlllman
did not submit his decree to 8. S. Balloi.
and the latter made objection, Intimating
that Sllliman had taken an unfair advan
tage. Gear sustained Silliman. saying
that the practice should never have been
the custom and that he did not Intend to
require It. He allowed a motion to amend
the decree.
The Republican Territorial Central Com
mittee held a meeting yesterday after
noon and changed its executive committee
from nine to eleven members after a vig
orous discussion, that promised to widen
the breach In the Republican party here.
The convention provided that the commit
tee should consist of nine members. an>l
the action waa opposed on the ground
that It was contrary to the rules. The
t-eason for the change was the impossibil
ity of getting a <iuorum of the committee
of nine, so many being away. The two
men added to the committee are both
from the Fourth District (Honolulu) and
are regarded as "missionaries." They ar.Â»
Colonel J. \V. Jones and J. A. Gllman.
To-day there is much discussion of the
action taken, and the anti-Dole paper*
declare lhat the missionary wing of the
Republican party is trying to override thÂ«>
other element without regard to rules.
The Republican says that cuch action as
was taken has been a stranger to Ameri
can politics since the birth of the repub
lic.
The naval transport Solace arrived
here yesterday from San Francisco on her
way to Tutuila. carry'ng Admiral Robley

BIGGEST FLOATING
DOCK IN WORLD
Successfully Passes the
Jetties on Way to
New Orleans.
Great Peat of Towing Per
formed by the Navy
Department.
NEW ORLEANS. Nov. 4.â The United
States naval dock, known generally aa the
Algerio dock, the largest floating doclt In
the world, passed successfully through
the jetties this afternoon, and will reach
New Orleans to-morrow morning, which
event will be generally and appropriate
ly celebrated. The towing of this Im
mense dock from Sparrows Point, near
Baltimore, to New Orleans, has been ore
of the greatest feats of towing ever per
formed, the dock making the marvelous
speed of eight miles an hour in spite of
the tempestuous weather It encountered.
' In going through the jetties, because of
the narrowness of the channel the dock
could travel only three miles an hour. The
dock will be received here to-morrow by
the Mayor, Congressmen and other offi
cials, and the day will be observed as a
holiday. The naval department has given
notice that the Illinois, the largest vessel
In the United States navy, will be sent
here to be docked in the new dock. It is
probable that the Secretary of the Navy
will be present at the ceremonies then
held.

sible for what appears in the paper, be
ing merely the majority stockholder. It

HIGHBINDERS
OUT TO SLAY
Serious Complications
Arise in Chinese â¢
Quarter.
c
Situation More Threatening
Than for Several Years
Past.
The present highbinder crisis In China
town Is regard-Hi by the police as beln*
more serious than any for many year*
past. Trouble is not only expected from
gangs of blackmailers and highway rob
bers, but four of the most powerful or
ganizations in the heathen quarter have
taken up arms, and. the paid assassins of
each tons only await, the opportunity to
commit murder. .'<
The bold attempt made to rob Leong
Kee. wife of Ching Kee, a prominent mer
chant, in a hallway at 622 Dupont street
early yesterday morning occupied the at
tention of Detectives George McMahon
and Ed Gibson later in the day. The
woman was returning from a social func
tion given in honor of Madame Wu Ting
Fang at the residence of the Chinese Con
sul when she was attacked. At the time
she wore jewelry valued at 91500 and car
ried nearly $&>o in gold coin in a purse.
She raised an outcry, frightening the
thieves away. Enraged at their failure
to secure the valuables they stabbed the
woman in the right arm and In the right
side.
- The ' detectives have yet no Â¦ clew as to
the Identity of the robbers except that
they belonged to a gang recently returned
from the Alaskan fisheries. They care
fully laid their plans to rob the woman
Monday morning, and followed her from
the consulate to the place where. the at
fair happened.' On Sunday afternoon Of
ficer Jack Tillman arrested Ah Chee for
carrying concealed weapons. This Mon
golian had a dagger the blade of which
was a foot In length. From secret sources
the police have learned that he was a
member of the band of murderous high
waymen. Â
The police also anticipate much' trouble
from blackmailers, who make do
mands for money, with death as
an alternative The murder of the
lookout In Buck Oye"s club was com
mitted by blackmailers Friday morning,
and Sunday Buck Oye Informed the of
ficers that they had placed a price upon
his head.
Serious complications arose over the
lockout's murder. He was a member of
the Chin family, and. this family accused
members of the Wong family of having
committed the crime. The Chin family
demanded that the Wongs either deliver
the murderers to them or suffer the loss
of five of their members. The Wongs re
fused to accede to the demands, and In
stead sent out their hatchetmen to spill
more blood.
The Suey Sing ton* and the Hop Sing
tong are at swords' ends, although they
have not yet broken Into open hostilities.
Tho trouble between these tongs grew
out of the prosecution of Sue Ho Mun anl
Ho Mun for the murder of a cook at the
corner of Pup-nt and Pacific streets
nearly two years ago.
Last night Sergeant Conboy distributed
his men throughout the Chinese quarter,
with instructions to search every suspi
cious looking Mongolian for weapons.
CAMERAS REVEAL
SOLAR SECRETS
Crocker Expedition to
Sumatra Benefits
Science.
LICK OB9ERVATORY. Nov. 4,-Dlrec
tor W. W. Campbell of Lick Observatory
haÂ« made public a report showing the re
sults achieved by the expedition sent to
Sumatra In May to observe the eclipse of
the sun. The report shows that success
crowned Astronomer Perrtne's efforts
and that many valuable photographs
were obtained. It says that the general
conclusion to be drawn from the many
valuable results obtained by the expedi
tion Is that the coronal structure sur
rounding the sun Is made up of matter,
probably very finely divided, ejected from
the surface of the sun with great veloci
ties. Just as we have matter ejected now'
and then from terrestrial volcanoes with
comparatively small velocities. This con
clusion Is entirely In accord with that
reached by Professor Schaeberle In 1893
from a different train of reasoning and
from an entirely distinct set of facts.
Regarding the operations of the expedi
tion, the report says tn^part:
It gives me great pleasure to announcse that
thÂ» Â«xpevlltloa sent to Sumatra from the Lick
Observatory, through the generosity of William
1. Crocker, to otserve the total solar eclipse
of May U was very successful. This announce
ment has been unduly delayed from the fact
thai the scientific apparatus anil the astronom
ical photographs containing the results were
sidetracked at an Asiatic port for three months
and have but recently arrived at Mount Ham
ilton. The expedition was In chance of Acting
Astronomer C. D. Perrlne. He was assisted
by Halpb H. Curtlss, fellow In astronomy at
the Kick Observatory.
A site for the observing station was selected
on the racecourse In the edge of the city of
I'adang. the capital of Sumatra, located at
about' the middle of the west coast of the
inland. The ten Instrument* were mounted and
In perfect adjustment a week before â¢ the day
of the eclipse.
The morning of the eclipse dawned cloudy
and the clouds persisted until the middle of
the afternoon. At the time of the ecllpue,
whir ii occurred a few minutes after noon, the
clouds wire comparatively thin. The negative*
were developed In the week following. The
photographs have reached home in perfect con*
dltlon.
The negatives obtained with the forty-foot
and thn smaller camera* show the Inner corona
as well, probably, as If there had been no
clouds to Interfere, but the longest recorded
streamers are limited to about one and a third
volar diameters. The photographs are full of
Interesting details, some of their features be
ing unique. They will be very valuable In
studies looking to an explanation of the origin
of the solar corona. *
Four cameras of eleven feet focal length were
uneri In making an examination for a possible
planet nearer to the nun. than the planet-Mer
cury. Photographs of the portion of the iky
to be occupied by the eclipsed sun were ob
tained on Mount Hamilton the night before the
apparatus was shipped to .Sumatra. Photo
graph* of this name region of the sky were
secured at the time of the eclipse.'
During the first, half of totality, when -the
clouds were thin, the negatives show stars
down to nearly the ninth magnitude; but dur
ing the latter half of the eclipse with thicker
cloud*, no stars were recorded. For about half
(he area. to be examined the results were,
therefore, very satisfactory;. -but for the other
half nothing* was secured. A comparison of
the photographs made here and In Sumatra
should lead to the detection of any unknown
bodies. ~ * â¢: .
The phototraphlc results from the polsrl
graph and the two apectrographs were better
by virtue of the clouds than they would hnve
been with a clear sky. Â¦ In new work of this
kind there Is very little to guide the observer
In forming his estimate of the length of ex
posure required. In this case It has happened
that the reduced brightness of the sky gave
proper density to the .negatives, whereas with
a perfectly clear sky the photographs would
have been over-exposed Â¦ and some of the de
rirfil results thereby lost. .- Â¦ . j
These fields of work. are highly technical In
their nature: but It will Interest many to
learn that the outer part of the corona dhow*
a large percentage of polarized light, whereas
the light of the Inner corona is polarized much
less strongly. The conclusion to be drawn from
these results Is that the light from the outer
corona Is largely reflected or diffused sunlight,
whereas that from the Inner corona originates
from the Incandescent corona Itself. , <
The spectrum of the outer corona as recorded
on the photographs appears to be. Identical with
the solar spectrum, whereas the spectrum of
the Inner corona Is entirely different. In that
It shows no trace of dark lines. The conclusion
to be drawn from these extremely valuable
results ts precisely the conclusion drawn from
the polarlgrsphlr results. .-. -...-.' Â¦Â¦,-â¢..- ,-

MODERN HOME
FOR MERCHANTS
New Structure Will Re
place Old Exchange
Building.
Money to Complete Purchase
Is in Bank Awaiting
Demand.
Indications point to the speedy demoli
tion of the old Merchants' Exchunge
building on California street and the erec
lion of v modern structure as the home
of the commercial bodies of this city. A
demand was made yesterday for $110,000
to complete the purchase of the Mer
chants' Exchange property. This money,
together with the entire purchase price of
the property, is now in the bank and will
be paid over immediately. It was stated
yesterday at the Produce Exchange that
tho construction of the new building will
be commenced in the near future.
Although the plans for the new struc
ture have not yet been fully outlined It
Is understood that it Will be from eight
to ten stories in height and equipped with
all modern conveniences. It will be the
homo of the Chamber of Commerce, San
Francisco Board of Trade, the Manufac
turers' and Merchants' Association, and
many other prominent commercial asso
ciations which are now scattered In differ
ent parts of the city. The new building
will have private offices and meeting
rooms for each of the bodies, as well us
general assembly halls. The cost of the
new building will probably aggregate
from six hundred thousand to seven hun
dred thousund dollars.
When completed the proposed Mer
chunts" Exchange building will be the most
elaborate und best equipped building en
tirely devoted to commercial development
in the United States. In drawing up ihelr
plans the merchants intend to take for
their model buildings which have been
constructed as homes x>f Eastern commer
cial bodies. The site of the old Merchants'
Exchange building, which Is 137:6 by
127:6, will afford ample room for a mag
nlflcent structure.
It was over a year ago that the project
of constructing a new home for all the
commercial bodies was first broached
Slnco then the Merchants' Exchange has
bven reorganized and materially strength
ened.

CIRCUIT COURT
HAS AUTHORITY
An Important Opinion
by Federal Appeal
Justices.
Territory of Hawaii Is Subject
to Their Jurisdic
tion.
Judges Morrow, Ilawley and De Haven,
sitting as the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals, yesterday handed down an
opinion sustaining the decree In favor of
lbelants in the United District Court of
Hawaii in the case of J. S. Low and John
Piltx vs. the Wtlders Steamship Company
and the steamship Claudlne.
The suit in admiralty was brought in
the District Court of Hawaii to recover
damages for loss of cargo and personal
belongings caused by a collision between
tho steamer Claudine and the barkentlne
William Carson, wherein the Carson was
sunk.
The appellees contend that this court
has no jurisdiction over an appeal in this
case for the reason that there Is no pro
vision of law directly authorizing the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals to
entertain appeals in admiralty from the
District Court of Hawaii. Appellees con
strue the law as making no provision for
appeals from the District Court except
when acting as a Circuit Court, and that
as the Circuit Court has no Jusidlctlon In
admiralty there is no "manner" of allow
ing an appeal In admiralty from that
court. .
In rendering its decision on this matter
tl.o court says that the Jurisdiction con
ferred over the Appellate Court Is general
an-1 comprehensive and such construction
an is here contended for would defeat the
appellate Jurisdiction of the Circuit Court
of Appeals, in nearly all cases arising in
the District Court of Hawaii, since the
Circuit Courts of the United States have
Jurisdiction with the District Courts in
but few cases.
The court then went Into the case on its
merits and affirmed the decree of The Ha
waiian court against the Wllders Com
pany.

Mai! advices from New York say: "Cur
rants are firm at sSC**Â«c for Amallas. with a
pood Bernard 'both for large and small lots.
Offers of s"â c for round lots were turned down
yesterday. The firmness of the spot market
in the face of the increased supply per La
iroaa Is vi:Â» chiefly to active buyinr. but
the knowledge that the Guildhall, with 6.* XÂ»
l<arre!s. cannot arrive until the latter part of
next week instead of this week naturally has
a strenrtr.er..n; influence.
"New pnsaaa at* not Plentiful on the spot
and are selling readily about as rapidly as
âÂ¦'; t>.Â»> ccme to har.d. On the coast the situation
is weaker. Oregon <0-50s. 59-Sis and 60-7 i)Â« are
offered on a basis of l\c and It was re-
tied j-esterday that several cars were sold
v at that low figure. New Oregon? are expected
on the spot next week. Raisins are quiet and
essier. S-<rown lore now tilling from i^^S'tC
here. No change is reported in the raisin
outlock on th? coast. Apricots and peaches
are quiet. Layer tigs arc very firm and in
*>xcel!Â«it demand.
Â¦"Sicily fÂ».::>erts are Vc lower at ?>%c. as a
result of liberal arrivals from the primary
market. Demand is good. Naples long filberts
are easier, selling from 9-Â©3 3 ,c. Tarragona
aimonds are firm a: HSc for new. The market
â¢n thÂ» other side is reported \c higher.
Swelled nuts are going out freely. Alicante
almonds are considerably higher in the pri
mary market, according to a cable."

DENY PROTEST
ON TUNNEL ROAD
Supervisors Remove Ob
stacles to Progress
of Work.
Merchants' Exchange Nears
the Goal for Which It
Hae Fought
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway. Nov. 4.
The Board of Supervisors to-day by
unanimous vote overruled the protests of
Mrs. M. M. Dunn and Charles Holmes
against the construction of the tunnel
road through the Contra Costa hills. Re
ports of the viewers of the route were
formally accepted, and District Attorney
Allen was directed to take charge of all
legal auctions which might arise In con
nection with the building of the road.
The viewers have decided to run the
road through the Dunn property instead
of across the Adams estate, because the
fanner route measurably reduces the
erade or. this side of the divide.
With the acceptance of the viewers* re
ports there remains nothing further to be
done fcelore the actual work of construc
tion can be commenced, following the sur
veys which will be made at once.
1 he completion of the road at no distant
f.ate will be hailed with preat satisfaction
l'y the Merchants' Exchange of this city,
which has had the project in charge for
several years. The tunnel plan was de
vised to overcome the almost inaccessible
grades across the hills that separate Ala
roeda Count} from Contra Costa County
-nd to facilitate wagon travel between
Oakland and the fertile farming country
to the northeast.
As planned, the new means of communi
cation will start from the head of Clare
.jo^'t avenue, and cross the hills by easy
k,.-..deÂ« to the tunnel, thence Into Contra
f.rsta County, where a connecting road
is under way. To further the merchants'
l.Jeas. a special committee of the Mer
chants Exchange to-day presented to the
Supervisor* a petition filmed by seventy
,.ve business men. merchants and prop
erty owners favorable to tht- new road

EBELL LADIES
ASK FOR FUNDS
Determine to Complete
Children's Room in
tbe Library.
Oakland Office Han Francisco Cal',
118 Broadway. Nov. 4.
ThÂ» ladles of the Kbell lectetjrÂ« through
the president. Mrs. Kate Bulkeley, have
issued a formal statement of the nation
concerning the pledge of the society t >
complete and furnish the children's room
in the new public library building. Th-j
president has nsked each member to con
tribute not lepj than $f. before December
1 toward the necessary fund to meet the
expense that will be entailed.
In part the appeal for financial assist
ance is as follows:
By the report of the chairman of the chil
dren's library committee It was nhown that
th- chairman and secretary or the original
commute*, actlnr for th* Ebell Koclety, had
requests the Bosrd of Library Trustees to
Inw the room unfinished and had promlf^d
not less than two to finish and furnlxh th*
Mice. ThU reÂ«iu*Â«t was grant**! by the Library
TnjFte*Â»i and the <"amegie money was ex
pended upon the rest of the building.
Without doubt the chairman and secretary
of the committee had confidence in their ability
to ralÂ»e the money snd did not expect to call
upon Kbell to contribute. But their plans ap
pear to have failed, the the trustees are now
ready for us to proewd with the work and the
money- Is not forthcoming.
At the meeting it was held that the society
waa not legally bound by thÂ« action of the
committee because such fiction had not been
approved by two-thirds of the members; still
the club was felt to I* under a moral obliga
tion to complete the children's room, ax for
two years It had been bo understood and no
steps had been taken to repudiate the the ac
tion of the committee. Kbeli, however, as
sumed no Indebtedness and made no promise
that pledges thÂ« society to any fixed sum
Five dollar* from each member equals $2000.
This, with the $14*0 already collected, amounts
to nearly ISWG The rest of the money, $1600,
It la thourJit can easily be raised by subscrip
tion or by entertainments.
â¢ Fellow members of Eb*|l, you are urged to
THE SAN^ FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5j 1901.
make thin effort for th* children of Oakland.
Do not allow that unflnlchM, empty room to
longer â¢tan'l a silent reproach to our club,
for unless tli* work la undertaken by Kbell It
cannot he a< â¢Â¦'â¢mi>llf > hÂ«Â»(l for ytart.
The nuhiwrlptlon lint Is now open at the
rÂ«oÂ»np. where it I* hoptti the sum of 12000. rep
ruwntlnu the Kbell member*, will soon be com
pleted.

VIEW OF THE WRECKED POWER-HOU6E OF THE OAKLAND. BAN L.EANDRO AND HATWARDB RAILWAY AT
ELMHI'RST AND THE FIREMAN WHO WAS BLOWN A DISTANCE OF FIFTY FEET BT THE FORCE OF
THE EXPLOSION AND MIRACULOUSLY EBCAPED SERIOUS INJURY
OAKLAND. Nov. 4.â The cause of
the explosion of the boilers of the
Oakland. San Leandro and Hay
wards Electric Railroad at the
Klmhurst powerhouse last night
is easily explained, though the officials of
the company display more than the usual
corporation reticence. The boilers were
simply overtaxed and could not stand the
strain of furnishing power to haul the
large Sunday crowds.
When the Oakland Transit Company as
sumed control of the Haywards line, the
Transit Company management Immedi
ately turned the powerhouse at Klmhurst
Into a general powerhouse for the supply
of their lines through Alameda and East
Ookland. The boiler capacity at Klm
hurst was ample when the lfayward* line
waa the only line operated from It. but
when the Alameda system and the smaller
East Oakland lines were added the capac
ity was taxed to the utmost. But by do-
Ing this the Oakland Transit fompany
was able to do away entirely with the
Alameda power generating station and
relieve the pressure upon their Piedmont
plant.
Bunday was a particularly fine day. and
the crowds that patronised the electric
lines were very heavy. The Elm hurst
power plunt felt the strain all day. Â«'ars
were late nnd kept getting later, showing
that the plant was overtaxed. Flnxlly the
bullers gave way.

another damper upon the Mayor* efforts

Plant a Heap of Wreckage.
Wheels, pipes and brickwork lie in a
confused heap. There Is apparently
nothing left or the bollern thai exploded
and wrought such havoc.
Borne portions of the shattered power
plant were thrown a eosjsMs "a UN* Jtotance
by the explosion. A piece of fencing
fifty feet long was blown across a side
street and left leaning against a tele
graph polo. A part of a red-hot rail waa
hurled through the transom of a barber
ahop. where It atarted a fire. Bricks were
picked tip this morning by schoolboys
blocks away from the scene of the ex
plosion.
Inhabitants of Rimhurst were telling
storiÂ»Â»a of narrow escapes to-day. With
the air filled with flying dchrls. It Is a
wonder that nobody was struck and killed
outright. A number of bystanders In front
of one of the restaurants narrowly es
caped death. They were standing con
versing when the iremondous report sud
denly burst upon their ears and simulta
neously two or three bricks were hurled
i gain* i a tree that stood between them
and the exploding boilers. The bricks
clipped a piece of an advertising sign
without requisition. Fie also wanted the
boant to send hack five typewriters re
cently ordered at a cost of $350 and to rent
the rnaehinea at h nomlnnl sum. Tils mo
tion did not prevail. The School Direc
tors nay they have no nlnns to keep the

tor's forcible flight through the air was
a thrilling experience.' â¢ Â¦
"I was standing In front of boiler No. 1.
talking with my helper, Nlcolaison. when
the explosion occurred." said Victor. "I
flew one way and Nlcolaison flew another.
Everything seemed to be falling away
from me. When I struck the ground I
was rendered unconscious and remained
ho about twenty minutes. I am told. Boil
er No. 5 was the first to explode. We
burned oil under that boiler and coal un
der the- other two. I looked at the water
gauge on boiler No. 3 Just a few minutes
before it went up. The gauge showed the
water to be all right. I have not satisfied
myself yet what caused the explosion."
An impression prevailed among the rail
road officials that Klmhurst and Its public
thoroughfares were the private property
of the corporation and the people were
hustled about on the streets as If they
were on the domain of the railroad. A
lot of employes were sworn In as deputy
constables and lines were run In all direc
tions Even when some expert engineers
asked permission to examine the boilers
In the interest of their profession their
request was refused.

MONTEREY. Nov.- 4.â The feast of Bt.
Charles Barromeo.' patron saint of the
Monterey and .El .Carmelo .'mission
churches, was celebrated at old Cannel-i
Mission to-day with elaborate ceremonies
and in the presence of a large throng from
Monterey and the surrounding country..
Tho ceremonies began with high mass at
10 o'clock, suns by the choir of San Car

sermons, ono In English by Rev. Father
1. M. Meat res of San Carlos Church and
one in Spanish by Rev. ' Father Matthias
Cuevas of .'. Watsorivlllc, , a Franciscan
friar. A procession In honor of San Car
los and veneration of the relic of the saint
followed the sermons and was one of the
most Impressive features of the day's
ceremonies. i â¢
The religious ceremonies took place 'in
the old Mission Carmelo. now rarely used.
In which are deposited the bones of Padre
Juniper o fiorra, founder of all the Cali
fornia missions, and the sacred emblems
and altar furniture used to-day were all
In iwe in the time of Padre Junipero,
many of the articles having been brought
by him from Spain when he entered upon
his mission work in -Mexico and Califor

oldest mission in the State. Is bare of all
furniture or adornment and has no floor
except the hard adobe earth of which the
walls are constructed.. The scene In thii
building, filled with people of several na

SOLARI FEARS

Accused Saloon-Keeper
Refuses to Answer
Grand Jury.
Timothy Newell Appears on
Scene as a Voluntary' Â¦*
Witness. - v>

Oakland Office- San Francisco Call.
. . 1118 Broadway, Nov. 4.
That he la a party to the accusation bt
bribery that resulted in the loss of Ma
position to License. Inspector Timothy
Newell was admitted by Saloon-keeper
Solarl of Alden to-day when he refused to
testify before the Grand Jury on . thÂ«
ground that anything he might offer to
the Inquisitorial body might incriminate
himself. To the City Councilman.. whÂ»u
he was subjected to an Investigation be
fore a license was granted him, Solari in
sisted that the $60 bribe he waa accused or Â¦
having offered Newell was only a "pres
ent." and an expression of horror cams
over his face when one of the Councilman
suggested that it was a. bribe. Just be
fore he went into Grand Jury chamber*
this afternoon Solari was directed by bis
attorney, M. C. Chapman, not to testify
at all. and when the Jurors began to In
terrogate him he declared that be feared
t<* incriminate himself, and then shut his
mouth as tight as the proverbial oyesU-r.
One of the unexpected events of the u<*y
was the appearance of Newell, the ma',
accused of soliciting a bribe. Newell's ap
pearance was voluntary. He had not been
subpoenaed, but as soon as be heard that
an Investigation was on he left his warn
In San Francisco, and upon reaching th*
Grand Jury chambers informed the mem
bers that he was ready to testify. When.
be reappeared in the corridors of the
Courthouse Newell's appearance bore'
testimony to the ordeal to which he had
been subjected, for his face was wreathed
in perspiration. He had little to say. and
would only admit that he told the same
story he has told all . alongâ that he did
not receive any money and that he madÂ«
a general denial of the whole bribe-taking,
story.
Mayor Barstow was the first witness
called when the Grand Jury convened this
morning to hear testimony.- All tho
Council men. City Clerk Church: R. F.
Jackson, secretary of the Board of Pub
lic Works; Solarl and bis barkeeper mad a
a busy crowd In the corridors until one by
one they disappeared as they were called
in to answer questions. Mayor Barstow
and the witnesses that followed him were
only detained a few minutes. The Mayor
related what he knew about the charges
he had heard against Newell and the ac
tion he had taken when Newell had re
fused to offer any explanation in his own
behalf. The Councilmen. not all of whom
were examined, related the testimony that.
Solari had offered before them when he
was an applicant for a saloon license.
Cuvellier was examined first of the Coua
cilmen. and Bishop. Bon. Wixon. Rucn.
Courtney, Boyer and Schaffer. in the order
named. City Clerk Church and Secretary
Jackson were called upon to relate what
they remembered of Solaris testimony
before the City Council.
. The Grand Jury took the matter under
advisement. : -..

ARMY MEN ENTER
CONTEMPT CASES
Major Van Orsdale Tells
Story Against Cap
tain French.
Pillsbury Subjects Witness to
a Severe Cross-Exam
ination.
Brass buttons and blue coats prevailed
In the Nome contempt proceedings yea
terday morning and afternoon. Major J.
Van Orsdaie. commander of the forces In
and in the vicinity of Nome during the
memorable McKenzie days, was on the
stand. A murmur arose when this officer
took the stand, for his coming was unex
pected, and Van Orsdale told a story
that placed Judge Noyes In a better light
than anything said or done since the open
ing of the hearing.
It is major against captain. E. S. Pills
bury. amlcus curias, placed Captain
French on the stand a few- days aÂ«o.
The captain was a subordinate officer un
der the major, and their statements as
to orders, declarations and conversations
about the writs cannot be reconciled.
Pillsbury subjected Major Van Orsdaie to
a scorching, grilling cross-examination
and found in several instances a com
fortable lapse of memory on the part of
the witness.
For the first time in many days the re
spondents' attorneys smiled with self
satisfaction. They think Major Van Ors
dale Is a real find. Metson didn't enter-
Tain any such opinion, however. He
â¢poured yellow slip after yellow slip Into
Pillsbury hands and filled his ear with
question after question. The brown hat
Â¦was ignored, but Metson's tips were
taken. â¢ 1
The respondents Intend to pot Judge
Noyes on the stand to-day, but before
they do so application will be made to
the Circuit Court of Appeals to have the
examination conducted In Its presence.
This will be done at 11 o'clock this morn*
ing. No matter how the court decides.
Judge Noyes will tell his story to-day.
Van Orsdaie Tels Els Story.
'When Major Van Orsdaie took the
stand. Mclaughlin's first Question was:
"Do you remember when the writs of
eupcrsedeas arrived?"
The major responded that he did - and
that be was at the barracks at the time.
three miles from Nome- It was Kenneth
Jackson who carried the information. .
"Jackson told me the writs had â¢ ar
rived." continued the witness, "and that
Receiver McKenzie refused to comply
Â¦with the writ; that there was danger of
trouble, and that a vigilance committee
was being organized in order to see that
the law was carried out. I sent Captain
French to town and he corroborated the
reports."
Major Van Orsda> came into town with
Car lain French and both visited Judge
Kopec They told the Judge --at it was
a serious state of affairs in Nome. The
reply to this was:
â¢The writs have been received and th 3
matter : is thus taken out .of my hand*.
I don't know what McKenzie will do."
"We then visited McKenzle. and he told
Â¦u> he would first consult a lawyer before,
acting. At 1 o'clock that day he told tat
fee was under heavy bonds for the gold
dust and would have to proceed cautious
ly. He said he would give up the mining
properties, but would keep the gold dust
until the Circuit Court of Appeals heard
his side o" the question."
Receives Letters From Noyes.
"Subsequently and on the same day did
ycu receive a communication from Judge
Noses'/" asked McLaughlin.
"1 d:d. a letter." This was produced by
th<Â» witness.
The letter is as follows:
NOME. Alaska. Sect. 13. 1900.
Major Van <>rs<JmlÂ«. Nome City. Alaskaâ My
Dt*r Via.), Altar you called with Captain
French th.Â» morning 1 saw the original paper*
on sic irota the Circuit Court of Appeals and
I f.r.l that it la r.ecetsary for an order to be
entered by this c- urt. which will be entered,
of course, a- soon as the same can be prepared,
and t-ui-h tanner steps taken a* will I* a full
*r.Â£ coajplfte ooai^llance with the order of the
Circuit Court of Appeals.
ily anxiety to this matter Is to do every*
t!:.i.Â£ hi ir.j- power and have all those In
Â¦*;â¢â¢:.-. I can In anywise control fully comply
r.ith the order or the court above, which, of
eoors*. v.:.. be Be. In the meantime It Is
necessary that matter* should r-~t la stiitu
<i - i > and ;Â¦*Â»â¢â¢ and order be preserved and I
therefore request, that you "render such as
sataaMa to the Marshal as may be necessary
to maintain that peace and quiet.
Kmmir:7m you or my desire li co-operate In
evÂ»ry effort that Is needful In Â¦Â¦'Â¦:Â». to pre
serve lite and property. I am. v*ry *lncÂ«rely
yours. ARTHUR H. NOTES.
Dubcse Becomes a Party.
Before the letter was received the wit
ness had- seen Marshal Va tiler, Mc-
Kenzle and Captain French together in
Captain French'e office. Vawter came
In during a discussion between attorney"
and was present when Major Van Ors
dale received the letter. Vawter' Â«< letter
vas also rec*Â«iv*Â»d at that time and each
party allowed the other to read his let
ter
Major Van X)rsdale then said that
Judge Noyes told him that he would act
according to the terms of the letter,
m-hich suggested that the witness detail
â¢ posse to protect the gold dust. The
Major declared that Marshal Vawter had
said nothing: but what was contained in
Ilia letter. Van Orsdaie heard nothing
about advice or declarations on Noyes'
part that any particular party should or
should not get the gold dust.
The witness was then taken In hand
by Mr. Piilsbury for cross-examination.
After questions of a specific nature re
lating to the writs and the conversations
bas^d on them when the witness wan in
formed of their arrival by Jackson. Mr
Pnisbury asked about an affidavit he
Kade and which was presented in the
Dubose proceedings. The major swear*
In this paper that Dubose did not advise
a certain party named to disobey the
writs.
At this point ensued the first of the
many altercations between the attorneys.
The witness affirmed and reaffirmed that
Dufcose gave no advice, and then Mc
laughlin counseled the witness not to
Â«nswer question after question that
were put by Piilsbury- Attorney Henry
Â«. Rot right into th*- middle of things and
lor a time things sizzled.
Witness Is Unsteady.
After much mental refreshment served
by th* amicus curiae, the witness recalled
that Mrtson. Knight and Lafe Pence saw
Kirn and asked for protection.
On September IS MrK^-nzle asked for a
military guard to bring In gold from the
Anvil Creole mines and Major Van Ore
<jÃle iwjufj-ted Captain French to send
out a sfjuad.
"Was nor Mr Metson there that day
requesting such military interference?"
said bury.
-I don't recall any such request on
>fc-tson's part." responded Van Orsd^i.
"Yi-t you sent out of your own motion
it guard to protect thin gold dust and
bring it. Into town?" Interrogated the
Â«mi"if curlae.
ThÂ»: witness had no recollection that
Matron ever asked him for military m,
port in carrying out th*Â» writ
On another tack PlUsbury drew from
the witness the admission that about
September 15 or 16 he thought that Can
tain French was Inclined to favor one
"Captain French BaM did he not that
the writs w*-rÂ» plain on th<-lr face and
that they should be enforced T' was th.

SARAH COWELL LE MOYNE SHOWS GREAT CLEVERNESS,
AND PLAY AND SUPPORT ARE BOTH OF HIGHEST ORDER
"First Duchess of Marlborough" Wins Complete Favor at the Columbia â Pollard Juve
niles Make a Tremendous Hit at Tivoli â In "Nancy & Company" Alcazar Has a
House-Filler â Damrosch Recital for This Afternoon â Royal Italian Band to Play
FOR an all too brief two hours and
a half at the Columbia Theater
last night the audience forgot that
there were any such folk as Tobln.
Wells and Schmitx in watching the
p*rlwlÂ«ed and polonaised Intriguers of
good Queen Anne's court doing politics.
Charles Hervey Meltser has written a
good Â«lay In "The First Duchess of Marl
borough." adapting his facts to his fancy
in places, as is his privilege, but keeping
pretty steadily to history In his character
drawing, which Is excellent. What 'The
First Duchess of Marlborough" would be
in other hands than those of Mrs. Sarah
Cowell Le Moyne and her excellent com
pany one can hardly imagine, but as in
terpreted by them it is an entertainment
that holds the interest from it** -lirst word
to its last. This is the more remarkable
in that the play lacks entirely the love
interest, depending only on the Ingenious
handling of court intrigues, a rather neat
wit and the picturesque character of the
portraiture and incident for its grip.
If Mrs. L.i Moyne has been fortunate In
finding in "The First Duchess of Marl
borough" a congenial medium of expres
sion Mr. Meluer has been no less fortunate
in finding a Mrs. L* Moyne to Interpret
his conceptions of the doughty Duchess.
To begin with, her perfections for the
actress la unhappily new to us. Mrs. Lc
Moyne'i reading is a* wonder and de
light. She haÂ» the charm of absolute nat
uralness, a diction In which every note,
pause, accent rings true, and entire com
mand of every Inflection and modulation,
of her voice. She looks the redoubtable
Duchess every Inch, curses with genius,
her every gesture, movement, expression
adding to the Impression of the masterful
Sarah's make-up. The evening was one
long triumph for the actress, "and should
Mrs. LÂ« Moyne ever again find herself
"out West" the will be sure of a Western
welcome. â¢ . â¢ â¢ ' .
Mrs. Le Moyne's company -la well
worthy to support her. There is a Dr.
Swift who seems to have Just stepped out
of the court of Anne into to-day. ho ex
cellently does Joseph Wllkes portray the
"scurrilous scrivener"â one of the first of
the yellow Journalist brood. Frederick
Pauldlng Is the slippery scoundrel. Klch
ard Harley. and chows a commanding In
telllgenoe-ln his conception. He Is finished
and restrained In his work, not one- touch
that could add to the nlcek. glib, servile
scamp's character being; forgotten. -Har
old Russell Is a stately and satisfying
Duke of Marlborough, and there Is a tiny
sketch of Haendel done by Axel Bruun,
that adds to the joys "of living. ?â¢>,?
The fat and saintly Anne, center of all
the intrigues, creature now of Sarah,. the
Duchess, and again, of. Masham, the small
er adventurer, is played to admiration by
Mary E. Barker, who gives very cleverly
the "wabbly" character of that tmich be
bothered monarch.' -Mrs. Masham is
played In graceful fashion by r a very
sweet- voiced young' woman who rejoices
in the euphonlotis^narae of .Nora'O'Brierl,
and none of -the "smaller parts In the cast
are slighted. V:' . * >C '
Costuming and scenery are sufficient and
picturesque and "The First Duchess of
Marlborough" 1* an assured success..- <
Alcazar. . " â¢
Around Marlon- Convert center the mys
tery and the charm of "Nancy & Co."
now being produced at the Alcazar. The
part she has affords her a brilliant op
portunity for the display of her talent
and the finesse that 'characterizes her
acting. - She Is a romantic wife, who has
written a play in conjunction with Kejfe
O'Keife, M, Her newly wedded spouse
being In blissful Ignorance of her pen
chant for the dramatic pen becomes In
ianely and ludicrously jealous of her when
he finds that the O'Kelfe has called to
ec-c her. at the Waldorf. It is In the last
act, however, that Miss Convcre shows
the serious side of her nature, alter the
excitement of witnessing the triumph of
her play, when her thoughts revert to her
husband and she reproaches herself for
having innocently caused him much men
tal anguish.
Margaret Wycherly. the Daisy Drifting
of thÂ«- play. Is wltcherly Indeed. She has
a most contaeloun smile and a most nat
ural manner of acting. The traditions of
the stage seem to have been left behind
and . the actress Isâ well, Just herself,
charming and piquant, that's all. Orcana,
Miss Axdm Rankcn. Is ,m Interesting
fiancee and pouts her jealousy very pic
turesquely. There Is plenty of love and
jealousy throughout the comedy, and,
speaking of love and soul-piercing kisses,
you ought to see Howard Scott hug and
kiss his stage wife In the last act. It
made all the bachelors In the house smack
their lips In envy. And there were others.
He klssfl her ho enthusiastically (In the
play, of course) that her back oomli fell
upon the floor and was rescued by Frank
Bacon, who never lets anything like that

Grimng of the play, are side-splitting. In
their hands the fun of the performance
loses none of its spice. Mr. Alsop. the
new leading man. gained fresh laurels for
the grace with which he played the role
assigned him.
Miss Convere's remarkable resemblance
to her sister Llla, who was the leading
lady at the Alcazar last season. is the
subject of general comment. Miss Marlon
supported Ada Rehan and then withdrew
In order to play Babble In Frohman's
"Little Minister." Last season she starred
ahead of her own company In "My
Daughter-ln-Law." James K. Hacked
recently offered her a position as leading
lady, which she was obliged to decline.
She is one of those rare artists who are
equally good In serious as well as comic
roles. She established herself as a fa
vorite last night and will grow more and
more popular with each reappearance.

The Pollard Juvenile Opera Company,
which" opened at the Tivoll last evening,
la simply Immense. Every tiny maid and

, parties whose names are not unknown In
â¢ the tenderloin district. Later by transfers
of stock Alexander Murdock, who for the
previous year nad been acting as an agent
I for S. P. Uiumenberg of Hotel NymphU
! fame, secured a controlling interest and
I was installed as superintendent. On Sep
j tember Dr. John P. Frizell was engaged
{ by Bluznenberg and Murdock as resident
; physician. Application was made .to tha
i State Commission in Lunacy for a license.
: This was: granted on October 23. and le?*
than two weeks 'later was revoked by Dr.
: Hatch. â¢! i
Profit the Only Desire.
The evidence at the Investigation showed
that the hospital was conducted^ more for
â¢ profit than regard for the welfare of the
inmates. Dr. Frizell was discharged
shortly after the license was issued, and
then tiled charges against . the Blumen
berg-Murdoclc management. Hl3 charges
were sustained by Dr. Hatch, whose find
