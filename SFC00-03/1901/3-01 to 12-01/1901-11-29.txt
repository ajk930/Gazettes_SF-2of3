HIRED MONGOLIAN ASSASSINS MURDER TWO
MEN AND FATALLY WOUND TWO OTHERS
ENCOURAGED by a price that had been set on his head, highbinders last evening shot and mortally wounded Love Fook, better known as Little Love, a notorious gambler, and Jue Do T his bodyguard. A few minutes
later two peaceful Chinamen were foully slain while asleep in their room on Clay street. The police have arrested a well-known highbinder, who is supposed to have shot the gambler and his bodyguard. The shooting was
witnessed by a white man. who is confident he will be able to identify the would-be murderers. Killing of a Chinaman by Fook in Sullivan alley six months ago is believed to have been the motive of the attack on him. The
murder of the two sleeping Chinese is a mystery. â¢

Colon Is quiet, but much anxiety prevails.
Government Force Repulsed.
Government soldiers last night renewed
the fighting. They started from San
Pablo, crossed the Barbacoae bridge and
proceeded toward Bohla Soldado, where
the insurgent force was intrenched. Rebel
pickets soon decried the enemy, and an
engagement, which lasted all night, was
begun. Owing to the better position of
the revolutionists the Government soldiers
were repulsed.
The federal force renewed the attack at
t o'clock In the morning and fighting
lasted about an hour.
It is reported by some of the insurgents
that the Government troops shot some of
their badly wounded men and also several
prisoners. It is also said that they rifled
the clothee of their dead comrades.
The revolutionists are still holding an
important position at Bohia Soldado. Gen

There is great rejoicing in the rebel

OF DISASTER
However, Five Score Im
migrants Die in the
Wabash Wreck.
Ninety Bodies of the Victims
Believed to Have Been
Incinerated.
With the Removal of the Debris Mor

Ashes Are Scattered
by the Wind.
DETROIT, Nov. 28.â When night fell
over the scene of last night's calamity
on the Wabash Railroad near Seneca,
i Mich., those who had been investigating
i the disaster had found nothing to alter
: the estimate of about eighty liv.es lost as
Â¦ a result of the collision. Superintendent
i George M. Burns of the division on which
I the wreck occurred insists that the esti
mates are too high.
"I do not consider," he said, "that the
total death list will exceed twenty."
However, in support of the larger esti
mate, it is pointed out that there are
now fourteen passengers known to be
dead. The bodies of eight of these have
been recovered, and it is considered that
the fragments of other bodies now in the
Morgue at Adrian will account for many
more than the twelve dead necessary to
make up Superintendent Burns' estimate
of twenty.
Remains Crumble to Powder.
In addition to the comparatively few
fragments recovered and sent to the
Morgue those who were early on the
scene say that many more pieces were dis
covered which crumbled to powder while
they were being removed.
Superintendent Burns said to-night that
he was unable to tell the exact number
of Italian immigrants aboard train No.
13, but thought that there were not more
than fifty. Passengers on the train, and
a number of those who were early on the
scene, disputed this and say the number
was nearer eighty. Superintendent Burns
has received no report yet from Ticket
Collector Eames of train No. 13, who
probably knows, nearer than any one else,
the number of Italians In the cars.
Coroner Hamilton of Adrian this after
noon impaneled a jury and will begin an
inquest into the disaster to-morrow. No
step has been taken as yet toward the ar
rest of Engineer Strong who, Super
intendent Burns says, is responsible for
the collision.
One Hundred Lives Lost.
The official list of the dead given to the
local papers shows the names of but ten
dead and forty-eight injured, but Detroit
newspaper men, who were at the scene of
the wreck and talked with survivors of
both trains, say that the official list does
not bear out the statements of the pas
sengers nor evidence of the horrible loss
of life which they witnessed at the spot
where the accident occurred.
The Free Press to-morrow will say that
the loss of life was in round numbers 100,
and that the statements made by the Ital
ian immigrants on train No. 13 bear out
this claim. These immigrants said that
there were about 126 of their nationality
on the train and that only about twenty
five of them escaped.
While only ten of them are known to be
dead, it Is asserted that th*> other ninety
were completely Incinerated and that
with the removal of the wreckage the
bodies crumbled to duet, which was scat
tered by the wind. If the names of these
dead are ever known it will be when
friends make inquiry/ for them and in
many instances this seems highly im
probable.
A Tribune staff correspondent, writing
of the scenes about the wreck, says: Only
one man was found who was an eyewit
ness of the collision.
Scene of Awful Horror.
A. W. Ely, a man 70 years of age,
residing at Seneca, stood at the depot
platform and saw train 13 go by. He
watched the train as she went down the
level track to destruction. His attention
was arrested by a crash. Then a stream
of flame and smoke shot 100 feet into the
air. Ely rushed to the wreck and was
the first outsider on the ground. Accord
ing to his statement, the scene was one
of awful horror.
"When I got there the immigrant cars
were already on fire and the shrieks of
the burned and injured were terrible. I
got hold of one man in the collapsed car
and pulled him out. He was horribly
crushed and his legs were broken. He
died almost as soon as I got him out of
the car. Then I went to the burning cars
and the scene made me wish I never
gone to the wreck.
"I don't believe more than fifteen Ital
ians got out of the wrecked cars, for I
saw but very few. Those who did get
out rushed around like crazy men", call- .

SHOOT DOWN LOUE FOOK, BETTER KNOWN AS
LITTLE LOUE, A GAMBLER, AND HIS BODYGUARD
Attack Them as They
Were Entering
Tan Game
MURDER was rampant in Chi
natown last night, and as a
result two men, one a cigar
maker and the other a gam
bler, are dead and two others
mortally wounded lie in the
Receiving Hospital. Both shootings were
the culmination of a long-standing feud
between rival highbinder associations.
The men who were killed outright were
foully shot as they lay sleeping in a bunk
at 902 Clay street. Their names are Quan
Lucy and Suey Duck. Love Fook, better
known as Little Love, a notorious gam
bler, and Jue Do are the other victims.
Fook was shot four times as he was en
tering his gambling house at 102 Waverly
place, accompanied by Do, who was his
bodyguard. As Little Love fell mortally
wounded Do drew his revolver, but be
fore he could use it he received a bullet
In his neck. He staggered to the 'street
and again raising his revolver he tried to
pull the trigger, but he was too weak to
do so. Turning to a friend who was
standing near him, he feebly pleaded with
him to take the pistol and shoot down
.the man who had wounded him and Fook.
The friend took the revolver, but instead
of using it he placed it in his pocket and
hurriedly left the scene. Shortly after
the shooting Sergeant Conboy and Polico
Officer Tillman arrested a notorious high
binder, who gave his name as Lee You,
on suspicion of having wounded both
men. He was seen hiding In a doorway,
and when the officers approached him he
ran into an alley and vainly endeavored
to escape. When searched a4l Colt's re
volver which had been recently fired was
found on him. The police think he is the
man who did the shooting.
Slain While They Slept.
While the police were diligently striv
ing to find a motive for this crime word
reached them that another shooting had
occurred in a lodging house at 902 Clay
street. Sergeant Donovan and Officers
Tillman and McNamara ran to the place,
and going upstairs they found the cigar
maker and his friend dead. Both had
been shot while they slept on a bunk in a
ing to heaven for protection and weeping
and wailing in their horror. Those poor
Italians! Nothing could be done to save
them and we were simply compelled to
let them burn."

small room on the second floor. So far as
the police could learn nobody saw the
murderers enter or leave the house.
It is supposed that the assassins con
cealed themselves in the house and wait
ed for a chance to kill their victims.
After the latter,, had fallen asleep tne
thugs quietly entered the room, the door
of Tfchich had been left unlocked, and shot
the sleepers, sending three bullets into
the cigar man's body and two, one each
into the head and back, of his companion.
Only fifteen minutes intervened between
the two shootings, which led the police to
believe at first that the double murder
was committed out of revenge for the
of the Congregation of the Propaganda:
"I went to the college in order to conler
with Bishop Matz on religious matters.
For all reply the Bishop had me arrested
by three police agents, who sent me to a'
lunatic asylum. I have never been In
sane and I am appealing against Bishop
Matz."
According to a dispatch from Rome, No
vember 24, the Right Rev. Nicholas C.
Matz, Bishop of Denver, and several Den
ver priests went to Rome because of fric
tion between Bishop Matz and the clergy
of Denver. There was a fracas at the
shooting of Little Love and hie body
guard.
In his ante-mortem statement to Dep
uty District Attorney Louis Ward, Little
Love declared that he had been shot by
Junk Fook and Jung Ming, both of whom
are well known highbinders.
"My bodyguard and I were about to en
ter my gambling house," he said, in giv
ing his version of the shooting, "when
somebody fired a shot at me. I turned
around and was again fired at, the bul
let striking me in the groin. As I fell
three more shots were fired at me, all
of which took effect. The last shot struck
my bodyguard, preventing him from
Bishop's residence among the clergymen,
and an intervention of the police took
place. Father Cushing.was arrested, but
later released.
MAYQR-ELECT LOW NAMES
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
Colonel Partridge, New York State
Superintendent of Public Works,
Gets the Place.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28.â The Times to
morrow will announce that Colonel John
N. Partridge of Brooklyn will be Com
mlÃSloner of Police of New York after
using his revolver. I am positive that
Jung Fook is the man who shot both of
us."
Grider Saw the Shooting.
W. F. Grider, who lives at 602 California
street, was the only white man who wit
nessed the shooting. He was passing
through Waverly place when he noticed two
Chinamen enter the gambling place, fol
lowed by two others. The next instant a
shot rang out, followed by several more.
"The man who did the shooting stood at
the entrance of the gambling place," said
Grider to the police. "I was standing on
the opposite side of the street and could
see everything that happened.
January 1. The Times says it is in a po
sition to say that Mayor-elect Low has
offered the commissionership to him; that
he has accepted, and that Governor Odell
has selected the man who is to succeed
Colonel Partridge as State Superintend
ent of Public Works. Colonel Partridge
will probably see Low to-morrow, and It
is expected that the appointment will
then be formally announced.

Chinese
"The Chinaman whom I now know l o be
Love Fook was walking upstairs whf n his
assailant ran after him and shot him
down. The wounded man's friend, after
the first shot was fired, ran downstairs
and as he started up the street he was
fired at, the bullet hitting him in the neck.
He staggered against a house a few doorÂ»
above the gambling joint and although,
as I thought, fatally hurt, he drew his
revolver and feebly tried to pull the trig
ger. Hailing a friend he begged him to
take the pistol and kill the man who 3hot
him.
"I saw the weapon passed, but no at
tempt was made to use it by the man to
whom it was given. At this juncture Spe
cial Officer Duffleld came along, but by
this time the man who did the shooting
and his companion had fled. I believe I
would be able to identify the assassins
in case they are arrested."
The police are at a loss to account for
the bloody outbreak of the rival tongs.
Fook was a Pin Kong Tong man and was
known as .a fearless fellow. About six
months ago he shot and killed a fellow
countryman in Sullivan alley, but was ac
quitted by a jury in the Superior Court.
The friends of his victim since then have
been anxious for a chance to put him out
of the way. Several weeks ago a price
was placed on his head but he supposed
that it had been withdrawn when the
"treaty of peace" was signed by the war
ring highbinders. Skeptical of the sin
cerity of the signers of the "treaty."
Fook never traveled the streets of China
town without an armed bodyguard. Both
of the murdered men were peacefully in
clined and so far as is known were not
connected with any highbinder torg. They
were, however, friendly with Fook and
frequently championed his cause.
As soon as Captain Seymour learned of
the shooting he sent all his available m*n
into Chinatown to prevent further hos
tilities if possible. Chief Wittman algÂ«
detailed a large squad to search every
Chinaman for weapons. In a short time

OLYMPIC ELEVEN SCORES A SAFETY AND DEFEATS RELIANCE
ATHLETES
STRUGGLE
IN THE MUD
Football Is of Poor Qual
ity, but Spectators
Are Amused.
Thanksgiving Games on
Eastern and Western
Gridirons.
OLYMPIC 2. Reliance 0. That is the
score of the interclub football
championship of the year between
the two big athletic institutions.
The contest this season was of
more than ordinary interest owing to the
fact that these teams haye not met for
Mm ral ;-ears.
It is safe to pay that no such a game of
football has been seen before on a local
gridiron. The Sixteenth and Folscm streets
field looked like "a map of the Thousand
Islands. A fair survey would show as
ir.uch water as mud. Two minutes after
the whistle announced the opening of the
game, the playen were thick with the
mud and their jerseys, jackets and foot
ball pants were neavy witii water. When
ever the two teams came logether there
was a splashing and a spluttering and an
ozing. Ankle deep In tht fine soft mire
or up to their knees in the puddles they
played their game to the great amuse
mer.t ol the crowd.
Olympics Better Swimmers.
To Percy and Sid Cavill, the swimming
Instructors of the Olympic Club, the vic
tory of the local team is due. The Olym
pics are better swimmers. Tney know the
gsame of water polo, are at home with a
wet ba,ll and can go through a scattered
lield with a side or overhand stroke that
made incompetents of ihe landsmen from
across the bay. Reliance was marooned.
Whenever the ball floated on one of the
many muddy lakes the Olympic retrievers
were sure to reach it first. The way those
twenty-two players flopped on the muddy
field, cut up the water with their gunboat
rushes and came down pell mell in a mix
ture of water, slimy mud, squashy clothes
and soaked bodies, suggested anything
but a fancy dress ball. The people cer
tainly got their moneys worth, although
the football was of poor quality.
On account of the wet weather the
crowd was much diminished in numbers.
The Thanksgiving Day game has become
an institution and there were scattered
through the grandstand the football de
votee whose attendance at the late No
vember gridiron contest has become a
habit. There was little shouting, however,
and no color to relieve the somberness of
the day. The bleachers on the east side
of the field were bleak and ur.tenanted.
Beveled in the Mud.
Almost sharp upon the hour set the Re
liance kicked off for a fair distance and
the sliding, driving, squirming game of
football began. The ball soon became so
slippery that it was an even chance that
with every pass there would be a fumble.
Big. burly Cadwallader, Plunkett, the
strong man. Gammon, the line bucker, and
Sherman, the fleet footed, stuck in the
mud and had to be released by Al L-ean.
"Society" Rodolph Â«f the Reliance team
sang "pretty maiden" refrains as soon as
the trainer of the Oakland team dredged
his mouth of Sxteenth andFolsom streets
mud. Then the ball kept moving slowly
down the field toward the Olympic goal.
Punts were frequent, fumbling became a
habit. The Olympic team gloried in the
Oregon weather and put into practice all
their tank tricks. It was a case of sea
dog against a land lubber. After ten min
utes cf slippery foot work, Rithet punted
long and high to the Reliance fullback,
Rodolph, who fumbled somewhere on his
own ten-yard line and the ball changed
colors.
Olympics Score.
Ten yards to go for a touchdown and
the going to the Olympics' liking â a murk
ish lake â made the few Reiiance shiverers
in the stand look darker than the clouds
above. But the Reiiance team anchored
and the Olympians stuck in the soft mud.
The ball changed hands and for the- time
the fame was saved.
A little more rain and a clearer lake
further to the left wrought an undoing to
the Oaklanders. The ball was passed for
s kick and it was fumbled. A Reliance
man dropped on it back of the line, but
before- he could recover and carry it up
field he was run ashore back of the goal
line and the Olympics had scored their
safety, the two points which won them
the game.
After that there was little football.
Now and then one side would gain a tem
porary' advantage, only to lose it by a
fumble. The heavier Olympics made 'the
greater distance by plugging away at the
Reliance line. Occasionally little Sher
man would pick his way out between the
lsker. and take long sails down the canals.
The second half was a series of line
bucks, off-side plays, kicks and fumbles.
A few attempts at place kicks failed.
The busiest man on the field was Pro
fessor Al Lean, who acted as chief mud
scraper. He would uncake the faces of
the men, pull chunks of mud out of their
eyes, scrape their feet and souse them
generally during the intermissions. His
gTest stunt was to resuscitate the tempo
rarily injured who were knocked out in a
puddle of water. Several were saved from
drowning by quick treatment.
Reid was dirty: but the play was
ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE OLD WAY
Of Treating Stomach Trouble and
Indigestion, a Barbarous and
Useless One.
We say the old pray, but really it Is the
common and usual one at the present
time, and many dyspeptics, and physi-
cians as well, consider the first step in
attempting to cure indigestion is to diet,
either by selecting certain food and re-
jecting others or to greatly diminish the
quantity of food usually taken.
In other words, the starvation plan :s
by many supposed to be the first essential
in the cure of weak digestion.
The almost certain failure of the star-
vation cure for stomach trouble has been
proven time an"d again, but still the usual
advice, when dyspepsia makes its appear-
ance, is a course of dieting.
All this is radically wrong. It is fool-
ish and unscientific to recommend diet-
ing or starvation to a person suffering
from dyspepsia, because indigestion itself
starves every organ and every nerve and
fiber in the body.
What is needed is abundant nutrition,
rot less, and this means plenty of good,
wholesome, well cooked food and some
natural digestive to assist the weak
stomach to digest it.
This is exactly the purpose for which
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets are adapted,
and this is the way they cure the worst
cases of stomach trouble.
The patient eats plenty of wholesome
food, and Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets di-
gests it for him.
And this is in accordance with nature
and common sense because in this way
the whole system is nourished and the
overworked stomach rested, because the
tablets will digest the food, whether the
tomach works or not. One of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets will digest 1800 grains
of meat, eggs and similar food.
Any druggist will tell you that Stuart's
Dyppepeia Tablets is a remedy of ex-
traordinary value and probably is the
purest and safest remedy for stomach
troubles.
No person suffering from poor digestion
and lack of appetite can fail to be im-
mediately and permanently benefited If
they would make it a practice to take
one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
after each meal.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER L>9, 3<>ol.
perfect football for the first sixty-five
minutes of play, Columbia's eleven rolled
up their largest score of the season
against the Carlisle Indian team this aft
ernoon. In that time they scored forty
points, shutting out the Indians com
pletely. In the last five minutes, however,
the Indians, making a sudden and unex
pected brace, and Columbia being weary,
going to pieces from the previous hard
work, the speedy Carlisle team gained
twelve points almost in the twinkling of
an eye, making the final score 40 to 12
in favor of the Blue and White.
Columbia's back field must be accorded
the greatest credit for the victory. Car
lisle suffered from lack of weight. Never
once seriously did Carlisle equal the merit
of Columbia's play. About 6000 people
were at the Polo grounds.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Novt 28.â With the
score tied, the football game between the
University of Alabama and the University
of Tennessee was called in the second
half. Objecting to the umpire's decision
over what he claimed was an off side
play, a crowd of 2000 persons, sympathiz
ing with Alabama, swarmed over the field
and the players were unable to continue
the game.
CHICAGO, Nov. 28.â Michigan scored al
most at will against lowa to-day, making
fifty points to the Hawkeyes' nothing.
Thus Michigan closes the regular football
season with a total record of 501 points,
while not one of the teams she has met
has been able to score a single point
STRANGE LIGHT
IN THE HEAVENS
Astronomers Unable to
Agree as to Cause
of Its Presence.
CHICAGO, Nov. 28.â What appeared to
many to be a comet was visible here in
the southern sky this evening. Its posi
tion as viewed from the Auditorium tow
er, in which the United States Weather
Bureau is situated, was about 10 degrees
southeast from the zenith.
Professor Cox, who is in charge of the
bureau, said: "I am not an astrono
mer, but I feel very positive It
was a comet. It wa3 plainly visible at
5:30 o'clock and we couid see it at 7
o'clock, when it became invisible on ac
count of the increasing haze. All the men
in the office saw it. It could not have been
a meteor, for it remained practically in
the same position during the entire Ume
it was vlsiDle and no meteor would have
done that. Its apparent immovability
sÂ«ows, too, that it was a great distance
from the earth. There was a head which
was plainly visible to the naked eye and
still more plainly seen when viewed
through a glass. There was also a well
denned tail. "
So strange and unusual was the appear
ance of the heavenly visitor that it could
not be accounted tot definitely by locai
astronomers. It furnished no end of
speculation for the public and weather
bureau and newspaper offices were be
sieged with anxious inquiries and requests
for some explanation of the phenomenon.
Some authorities "were inclined to think
that it was a streamer from the auroia
borealis or northern lights. There were
some who decided that it was a fantastic
display of the rays of the moon reflected
by the broken clouds and heavy moist at
mosphere and smoke hanging over the
earth. All agreed that it was a most
unusual spectacle.
Whatever it was it certainly played to
a large gallery in Chicago. Opera glasses
were in demand and the crowds on the
streets and on the surface and elevated
trains craned their necks to get an ob
servation with the naked eye.
"It was almost certainly a streamer of
the aurora borealis," said Professor
George W. Hall of the Yerkes observa
tory, Lake Geneva, Wis., Who was spend
ing Thanksgiving in Chicago. "So far
south, however, such manifestations of
the northern lights are extremely unusual.
The light seems to be in our own atmos
phere. An evidence that it is probably
the aurora is that it stays in the same
place in the sky. If it were a comet it
would appear to move with the other
stars from east to west."
Professor George W. Hough of the
observatory of the Northwestern Univer
sity, commenting upon a description given
him, said:
"It may have been a reflection of the
lights of the city or it may have been a
searchlight reflected In the cloudÃ and
heavy atmosphere. Such things are alto
gether possible. It would hardly be the
aurora borealis, since the northern lights
would not be apt to be seen so far south
without brilliant manifestations to the
against her. lowa played a plucky game
but was outclassed. Huston and Shorts
played a spectacular part for the Wolver
ines.
CHICAGO. Nov. 28.â Wisconsin 35, Chi
cago 0, and Wisconsin's goal only twice
in the slightest clanger. Thus did the Wis
consin eleven make good their boast to
defeat the University of Chicago football
team by a good round number over the
score of 22 to 0, made by their rival for the
Western championship, Michigan. Straight
football won the day and team work on
the part of the victors was clever, though
in nearly every case scores were made
by .star plays. Chicago throughout the
game put up a strong though unavailing
offense.
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 28.â The Missouri
University eleven to-day won a valiant
victory from Kansas by a score of 18 to
12. In the first half Vincent carried the
ball over for the first touchdown after less
than ten minutes' play. Jenkinson kicked
an easy goal. A simiiar play on the part
of Missouri tied the score. Forrester going
through for a touchdown and McCaslin
kicking goal. Playter of Missouri, left
halfback, suffered a broken collarbone and
retired in favor of Manderson. The Jay
hawkers became desperate toward the end
and an efforfwas made to strengthen the
line. Leighy replacing Dodd and Houx
taking Beaman'a place. The change was
immediately effective and Vincent scored
Kansas' second touchdown, Jenkinson
kicking goal. Final score: Missouri, 18;
Kansas, 12.

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 28.â The Univer
sity of Pennsylvania football team ended
its disastrous season to-day with a
crushing defeat at the hands of the Cor
nell eleven, the Ithaca boys scoring 24
points to the Quakers' 6. It was the first
time since the two universities have
played football together that Cornell has
been able to conquer Pennsylvania.
All through the contest the Red and
Blue players fought their opponents
every inch of the way, but the doughty
boys from New York State were superior
to them in every department of the game
except in punting. No matter how hard
the Pennsylvanians tried, Cornell was
always there to meet them. Cornell's of
fense was powerful. It seemed little dif
ference where they triedâ through the
center, against the tackles or around the
ends â Pennsylvania was able to hold them
not more than a half dozen times. A
notable feature of Cornell's attack was
the fine interference for the runner in
open play. Two of her touchdowns were
made solely through the good help given
the man with the ball. In the defense
Cornell was like a stonewall. It was
near the end cf the first half before
Pennsylvania was able to make a first
down and the total made in the entire
contest did not number more than ten.

HUNGER MAKES
HIM A SUICIDE
Young Man Terminates
His Life in Los
Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2S.â Neil C. Neil
son, aged about 23 years, shot and killed
himself some time last night in his room
at the lodging house at 243Vfe South Spring
street, the body being found this morning.
It is believed that hunger drove him to
suicide.
Neilson walked into the police station
on Tuesday and asked for protection
from some men who were following him.
He Jaid he had arrived in the city only
two days before from his home in Mason
City, lowa, where his father, C. H. Neil
son, resided. He had his valise with him
at the time. As the man was plainly de
mented he was booked for medical treat
ment and locked up for safe keeping.
The next day Neilson had quieted down,
and as a friend appeared and said he
would care for him he was released*
Nothing more was heard of him until his
death was reported this morning.
Egloff Anderson, who appears to have
been Neilson's companion, says that he
and Neilson had come out from Mason
City together, and, from his statement,
they had been here for several weeks.
Neilson did not meet with the success
that he -expected when he came here and
it is stated that he was suffering greatly
from hunger, which is supposed to have
been the cause of his insanity.

The score was: Nebraska, 18: Haskell,
10. The Indians, with a brisk south wind
favoring them, fairly played the Nebras
ka men off their feet in the first half,
excelling in punting, giving buck for buck
in offensive work and showing a slight
superiority in defense. Both sides fum
bled badly. The ten points made by the
visitors came in the first half on two
goals from field, both by right tackle
Baine, respectively from the twenty-five
and thirty-five yard lines. Nebraska
braced up wonderfully in the second half,
two sensational end runs being the star
features of the contest. Three touch
downs at ten-minute intervals, followed
each time by a goal kick, made the final
score stand: Nebraska, 18; Haskell, 10.

SALT LAKE. Utah. Nov. 28.â The Uni
versity of Nevada defeated the Univer
sity of Utah to-day in a close and excit
ing game by a score of fi to 2. Both teams
showed up much stronger in their of
fensive play than on the defensive and
the loss of the ball at any time meant a
gain for the opposing side. The feature of
the game was a magnificent punt by
Graham of Nevada, who sent the ball sev
enty yards from Nevada's five-yard line.
Another good punt under difficulties was
that of Bennion of Utah. A fumble which
followed this was all that kept Utah
from scoring: a touchdown. Roberts and
Harker of Utah made good end runs.
Smith nf Nevada did fine work against
the guards. Wright of Nevada did some
fine tackling.

STANFORD
MEN DEFEAT
SOUTHRONS
Cardinal Team Does All
Its Scoring in the First
Half of Game.
Runs Up Total of Twelve
Points to Nothing for
Opposition.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28.â A score ct)
12 points was the beat the Stan
ford eleven could make this af
ternoon in the game with the All-
Southern California team, an
eleven chosen from preparatory players
and university alumni.
Five thousand people were) at Fiesta
Park to witness the contest, and the
crowded bleachers presented all the va
riety of color and waving flags of an in
tercollegiate match. Along the side lines
the space was well filled with coaching
parties and automobiles.
The day was too warm, for fast foot
ball and both teams showed the effects
of the hot sun. The Stanford men were
evidently out of condition and in shape
for a hard game, while the local players
were in Jittle better condition on ac
count of the abort time they have been in
training.
All the scoring was done in the first
half. At 2:30 the teams lined up and
Southern California kieketl off to Stan
ford's ten-yard line. From there the
Cardinal carried the ball down the field
for long gains. Traeger made a pretty
run of thirty yards and Slater wenf
through the line for a touchdown after
eleven minutes of play. In nine minutes
more Stanford scored a second touch
down and the half ended with the ball in
Southern California territory.' The Cardi
nal punted often in the first half but the
Los Angeles men were unable to keep the
ball in their possession. During the sec
ond half Slater's consistent fumbling In
receiving kicks and the star work of Ba-v
zata, fullback for Southern California,
forced Stanford to stiffen its defense to
prevent an adverse score. Neither team
played fast ball. For the Southern team
Bazata and Ryas distinguished them
selves by fast and heady playing. The
team showed lack of practice and by rea
son of slow execution of plays and fre
quent fumbles the players Â¦were not able
to advance the ball for consecutive gains.
The play of the Stanford eleven was
careless and half-hearted. At no time was
the Cardinal goal in danger, yet the visit
ing team failed to score after the first
twenty minutes of the game. Klokke,
left end of Southern California, threw his
shoulder out soon after the kicftoft and
was forced to retire. No other injuries
were sustained by men on either eleven.

REVENUE CUTTER MAY GO TO NORTH
TO AID MINERS WHO ARE STRANDED
Captain Shoemaker Orders Investigation of Destitution Caused by
Mishap to Schooner Ralph J. Long.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â The report that about 115 miners from Cape Nome are in serious straits at Unalas
ka, Alaska, as the result of the stranding of the schooner Ralph J. Long, is being investigated by
the Treasury Department, with a view to their relief if the necessity exists. Captain Shoemaker, chief of
the revenue cutter service, to-day telegraphed instructions to an official at San Francisco to investigate
the story and if the miners aTe in distress a revenue cutter, probably the McCulloch, will be ordered to
Unalaska. The cutter will bring back the stranded miners or escort the schooner to port in case the
latter is able to sail.
Collector of the Port F. S. Stratton said: "I have no advices concerning the schooner Ralph J, Long. The cut
ters McCulloch and Bear are available for rescue service and can leave within forty-eight hours' notice, if necessary."
CAPTIVE AMERICAN MISSIONARY WOMAN
AND HER COMPANION SLAIN BY BRIGANDS
Latest Report Concerning Miss Stone and Madame Tsilka Is That
They Have Been Put to Death by Abductors.
NEW YORIt, Nov. 28.â A World special
from Vienna says: A private telegram
sent from Pera at 1 o'clock this afternoon
reports that the news has just been re 7
ceived that Miss Ellen M. Stone, the
American missionary, and Madame Tsilka,
her companion in captivity, have been
murdered by the brigands.
The foregoing cable dispatch to the
World brings the very latest report con
cerning Miss Stone and Mrs. Tsilka. The
shocking news it carries was sent from
Pera, a suburb of Constantinople where
some of the foreign Embassadors have
their residences, to Vienna. In Constan
tinople, more perhaps than at any other
point, the foreign envoys work together

Fire at the East River
Causes Loss of Half
a Million.
NEW YORK. Nov. 28.â Half a million
dollars is the estimate of the loss of a
fire this evening in the vicinity of Ninth
street at the East River. Several fire
men were hurt, but none seriously.
The blaze started in the plant of W. E.
Updegrove & Bros., manufacturers of
boxes, veneers and fine wood work, and
this firm was the principal sufferer. One
of its buildings was a seven-story struc
ture, while those surrounding it were one
story buildings. All of Updegrove &
Bros.' mill was destroyed. From the
Standard Oil Company's depot on
Eleventh street thousands of gallons of
oil were drained into the river to prevent
a great explosion and resulting conflagra
tion.
What started the fire is not known. It
swiftly spread to all the Updegrove build
ings. Within and surrounding these were
great quantities of kiln-dried wood to
feed upon. By the hardest of work the
firemen kept the flames from reaching
three big lumber yards adjoining. The
walls of the larger Updegrove building
fell in and crushed the stable of the Stan
dard Oil Company in the rear. All the
horses had been removed.
After the lire was thought to be under
control it broke out again and spread to
the works of the Mutual Gas Company.
This outbreak was caused by a fireman
dropping a burning window sash into the
street. The street was flooded with water
on which was a thick coating of oil. This
ignited and the flames leaped into the gas
company's property.
The fire then turned back across the
street and the immense store of lumber
owned by Hegemeyer & Sons was ignited.
It comprised some 18.000,000 feet of valu
able woods. The lumber yards of J. M.
Saulspaugh were also reached by the
flames and great damage done.
riGHT AGAINST PROPOSED

Idaho Is Not in a Position to Give

BOISE, Idaho, Nov. 28.â 1t is understood
this evening that Governor Hunt will no
tify Governor Van Sant of Minnesota that
Idaho is not in a position to give active
aid in the proposed move in the North
western railroad consolidation. He finds
there is no law under which he can take
action and that he would not be justified
in calling the Legislature together for the

have the moral support of this State.
Despondency Causes His Suicide.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28.â The body of

SCIENCE SCORES AGAIN.
A Preparation That Will Destroy the
Dandruff Germ' Discovered.
Finally the scientific student has dis-
covered a certain remedy for dandruff.
When it first became known that dan-
druff is the result of a germ or parasite
that digs into the scalp, and saps the
vitality of hair at the root, causing fall-
ing hair and baldness, biologists set to
work to discover some preparation that
will kill the germ. After a year's labor
in one laboratory, the dandruff germ de-
stroyer was discovered; and it is naw em-
bodied in Newbro's Herpicide, which,
besides? curing baldness, and thinning
hair, speedily and permanently eradi-
cates the dandruff. "Destroy the cause
and remove the effect."

Alive on November 24.
SOFIA, Nov. 28.â A telegram received
from a private agent at Dubnitza says
that Miss Stone and Madame Tsilka were
alive November 24.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 28.â The rumor of
the death of Miss Stone and her attend
ant, Madame Tsilka, which reached the
State Department yesterday, came from
Turkish sources, the first informant be
ing the Vali of Salonica. The two women
were said to have been held captives at
Vesnej and Myejrjeza, two towns sup
posed to be on the Bulgarian frontier,
but which have not so far been located
in the atlases. The fact that both Eddy
and Consul General Dickinson emphatic
ally discredit the report of Miss Stone's
death is regarded here as indicating their
purpose to continue without relaxation
their efforts to secure her release.
"Your Moneys Worth"
Your Moneys Worth ! That's the - war cry in the great battle of money and
merchandise." Every merchant claims, and a good many try, to give it to you. In
clothing it is an all-important question and should be considered. As a claim to
your patronage through giving you your moneys worth we consider you the judge
and the jury. 'If you think you haven't your moneys worth you can have your
money back. This is the corner-stone in the building up of this business.
. We give you your moneys worth by selling directly to you, thus eliminating
all the middleman's profits. Our clothing is our own make â that's why we guar-
antee it â and that's why we can sell better clothing to you at lower prices than
any other dealer who buys through a middleman. Facts are facts.

MANILA, Nov. 28.â The Unted

Darman. She will probably be
a total loss. The Wright struck
on uncharted rocks at the entrance of

FOR THIEVING SOLDIERS
Biigadier General Randall Is Making
a Reputation as a Military
Prosecutor.
NEW YORK. Nov. 28.â Brigadier Gen
eral Randall, commanding the Depart
ment of the Columbia, is making a repu
tation as a severe prosecutor of soldiers
guilty of small thefts. The record of a
court-martiai just received here shows
that a recruit, Alexander Rees of the
Tenth Field Battery, was sentenced to be
dishonorably discharged from the service
of the United States, to forfeit all pay
and allowances and to be confined at
Alcatraz Island for one year for the lar
ceny of a shirt. General Randall approved
the sentence reluctantly, because it im
posed simple confinement, when in his
opinion it should have included hard
labor.
Mexico Encourages Railroads.
CITY OF MEXICO, Nov. 28.â The first
reading 1 has been given by Congress to
the report on public works regarding a
contract made with the Mexican National
Railroad Company for the construction
of two new lines, one from San Miguel
Carmargo to Monterey and another from
the City of Mexico to a t>oint on the pres
ent main line to Laredo, and also for
changing the gauge of the main line. The
report of the committee, which is favor
able, shows that the new lines and the
broadening of the gauge will be for the
benefit of the business of the country.
tlon of the rescue of the vessel was prob
lematical.
The United States transport Wright,
formerly the Aid. was originally a fruiter
and was presented to the Government by
some patriotic women of Boston when the
Spanish war broke out, to be used as a
hospital ship. Later sne was flttec l out .is
a dispatch boat and was sent to Cuba to
be used by General Wood. More recently
she was sent to the Philippine Islands as
a dispatch boat and store ship. She had
a refrigerating plant and refrigerated
storeroom, which made her of great value
in the islands. The Wright was first
called the Bay State. This was before
she was transformed into a hospital ship.

Sensational Pay in the Professional Golf Tournament
LIKE a beautiful bird with droop
ing plumage was Burlingame
Country Club yesterday. Presi
dent George Aimer Newhall and
the other officers of the club
had planned an interesting programme
of hign class outdoor pastimes, including
a meet of the San Mateo {County Hunt,
by invitation; a tennis tournament for
members, a professional golf tournament
and a game of "squash ball."'
The conditions all seemed propitious un
til the downpour yesterday morning
dampened the ardor of many intending
participants. From early morning the
telephone wires were weighted down with
messages cam-. -ling luncheons and other
engagements. The thorough-going sports
men were not to be daunted by the
weather, the outcome being a most
interesting and successful ride with the
hounds arid a sensational performance on
the golf links by Reilly, the Burlingame
Club instructor.
The rain robbed the clubhouse veranda
of all the light and color and gayety
which would have marked the scene un
der sunny skies. There were no light
dresses to relieve the somber effect of the
leaden skies. Within the clubhouse an
orchestra enlivened the occasion while
the men rode the hunt again at lunch

The most notable absentees were Wal
ter Hobart, the first master of the hunt,
and his big gray horse Royalty. Mr. Ho-:
bart was present in ordinary attire, but
did not ride. Heretofore he has been a
conspicuous figure in the first flight of
horsemen.
J. J. Moore, acting master of the hunt,
la the absence of the popular Francis J.
Carolan, was mounted on his favorite
huntress Bridesmaid. Mr. Moore sported
the scarlet coat and the silk hat and
looked the hunting squire to the life. He
Â¦was exceptionally well mounted and gra

Charley Dunphy, the best horseman in
California, had a mount on Mr. Moore's

style.
A. L. Whitney rode his horse Old Salt

The other members of the field were

finish was in a driving rain they consid

The hounds were laid on in the presence
of but a small group of spectators. There
were no gay scenes and no demonstration,
the horsemen riding away quietly. They
were quickly lost to sight among the trees
and were soon but a memory. Long after
they had disappeared the hounds could
be heard giving tongue. The hunt was

occupied one hour and thirty minutes. In

The day was excellent for scent and the
footing for the horses proved safe, con
trary to general expectations. There were
no falls. John Lawson and Charley Dun

The former finished bareheaded, while
the latter improvised a headgear out of
his ' Handkerchief. There was a slight
drizzle half an hour before the hunt
ended. This gradually developed into a
downpour, through which the riders made
their way to the finish. The rain did not

bar to many spectators witnessing the
game. -The play was pronounced the most
brilliant ever seen on the Â¦ club links.
Reillv'a first two rounds in thirty-nine
strokes each lowered all previous records
there. He made the sensational play of
the day at the sixth hole in the' second
round. The Â¦â¢ "bogie" or perfect-, score is
five strokes, but he made the 400 yards in
four strokes. With three of these he sent
the ball 350 yards and then in a

"CORBETT" WINS
FROM M'GOVERN
Knocks Out the Cham
pion in the Second
Round.
Terry Is Clearly Outpointed
by the Boy From
Denver.
HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. %%.â Knocked
out in the second round, of which one
minute and forty-four seconds had
elapsed, was the referee's verdict in the
fight between Young Corbett of Denver
and Terry McGovern of Brooklyn, who
has defended the featherweight cham
pionship against all comers since he won
it from George Dixon eighteen months
ago.
Outwitted and outpointed by a fighter
of the same style as himself, McGovern
had to lower his colors this afternoon at
the Nutmeg Athletic Club to Young Cor
bett within six minutes from the start
of the fight.
Young Oorbett, who outside the ring is
"Billy. Rothwell, defeated the champion
in less "than two rounds of fighting. He
uid it so thoroughly there was no douot
about it. The shock to the New York
enthusiasts who crowded the boxing pa
vilion when the little champion was
knocked out in the second round was a
repetition of the disappointment exhibited
by the adherents of John L. Sullivan
when Corbett defeated him in New Or
leans.
Terry was as fit as the proverbial fid
dle, but he was not fast enough for his
opponent. From the start the men went
at each other like game cocks and it
looked as if either would go out in the
nrst round. McGovern got the worst of
the opening round, and in his endeavor
to get in left himself open several times.
Corbett stood off McGovern on every lead
end trick, but the little Brooklyn boy
went on as if there were nothing to it
but the winner's end of the purse.
McGovern Knocked Down.
When McGovern was knocked down in
the opening round there were cries of dis
may from his backers, but his wonder
ful recuperative powers were equal to
the occasion and he was on his feet
within seven seconds.
This downfall seemed to take the stam
'na out of McGovern, but he fought the
round in clever style and tried hard to
stem the tide of defeat which seemed to
have set against him. He tried all his
rushing work which proved so profitable
on former occasions, but Corbett met his
every move and countered hard on neck,
jaw and head.
When Terry came back to his corner at
the end of the first round he said:
"That's the toughest guy I ever met,
but I'll lick him just as soon as 1 see an
opening."
The opening did not come as the little
Denver pugilist had then taken his meas
ure. Down went Terry again in the sec
ond round, and when he got up quickly he
rushed like a wild man. He showed a
lack of self-restraint and in a burst of
bad temper hit out left and right, irre
spective of all rules and usages. These
tactics apparently were just what Corbett
was looking for.
Throws Science to the Winds.
Terry was mixing things at a whirl
wind rate and throwing science to the
winds. It was any one's fight at this
stage, but Terry fell into a trap as Cor
bett feinted and suddenly sent- his right
out when McGovern was side-stepping.
This blow just grazed McGovern's head,
but a moment later Corbett feinted again
and after a rattling exchange sent his
right over to the jaw and Terry went
down and out. While the fallen champion
was frantically trying to regain his feet
the crowd yelled mftdly. The referee de
clared that Young Corbett had won. He
won on his merits as he took no chance.
Terry was crestfallen after he re^
turned to his dressing room. Hfe said:
"Well, you can't tell how things can be
accounted for. I hope to make another
match with Corbett, and I am more than
confident that he will not be able to put it
over me again."
Young Corbett was demure when lie
emerged from hi* dressing room. At first
he was reluctant to talk, but finalfy said:
"1 was sure I could beat McGovern. My
opinion was husfd on what'l had seen and
heard of him. J felt I had him from the
first punch, but I was cool-headed all
through. When I began to sting- him he
lost his head and when he lost his head
it was all over. I had him right thore.
and with a right swinging upper cut *
landed the blow which won the battle.''
The Fight by Rounds.
Round Iâ MoGovern tried for an opening
with his left and sent the right to Corbett's
Jaw. They clinched. In the ' mix-up both
landed lefts. They exchanged lefts on the
face, and McGovern, niKhing again, sent his
left to the body and right to the head. Por
bett was short on his leads and Terry pent
him to the ropes with a hard right over the
heart. McGovern ducked a left swing and
landed hard right on 'the eye, forcing Corbett
to the ropes. Corbett came back pluckily
with a left on the body, which was countered
with a right over the heart from his opponent.
McGovern led HRain with his right, landing on
his opponent's shoulder. Corbett came back
with a hard right over the heart, sending Mc-
Govern back. The Brooklyn boy retorted with
right and left, only to be met with a swing on
the jaw, which sent him on his back. He
jumped to his feet Immediately and went at
his opponent hammer and tongs on the chest
and face, forcing him to his knees. Corbett
got up and the round ended in one of the hot
test mixes on record, with honors about even.
Round 2â McGovern rushed in with a left to
the body and the men clinched. A rapid ex
change of rights and lefts followed. Corbett
was on the defensive and met Terry's rushes
with straight left jabs. Suddenly he brought
up his left, upper-cutting McGovern and send
ing him to the floor. McGovern took five sec
onds of the count and came back like a wild
man, with left and right swings. Science was
thrown to the winds and the boys began slug
ging. McGovern was very wild and they made
a half circle of the ring fighting in this man
ner. At this stage it looked like anybody's
fight should one of the vicious swinging blows
land. While Corbett kept his head and seemed
to bore in better, his body blows were appar
ently no stiffer than those of McGovern. How
ever, he kept on forcing McGovern across the
ring pnd finally Terry foisot his defense. He
simply saw a hurricane ot' blows coming to
ward him and there was n~> guarding on his
part. Suddenly a right swinging upper-cut
landed squarely on the point of his jaw. and
McGovern went down and out. He was not
rendered unconscious, but it was evident to all
present that he knew the championship had
taken wings and he made wild efforts to regain
his feet. Referee White called off ten seconds
while McGovern valiantly struggled. Corbett
stepped back in obedience to the referee s ges
ture, although he evidently was in doubt as to
bis fallen opponent's condition. McGovern had
given him such a gruelling argument that he
was for the moment dubious as to whether the
Brooklyn boy might not be able to come up
again and renew the battle. Put it was all
over, and in a few minutes the new champion
was in his dressing room receiving the con
gratulations, while McGovern was wondering
how it all happened.
After the fight a purse of $10,000 was of
fered by the Twentieth Century Athletic
Club of San Francisco for another fight
between McGovern and Corbett and Mc-
Govern accepted the offer. Dave Sullivan
challenged the winner of to-day's fight.
Walcott Defeats Jackson.
BALTIMORE. Nov. 25.-Joe AValcott
gained the decision over Young Peter
Jackson before the Eureka Athletic Club
here to-night after twenty rounds of per
haps the fiercest fighting ever seen in
this city. Most of this was done by Wal
cott, Jackson being on the defensive from
start to finish. Walcott sailed in from
the first, with the evident intention of
finishing his man as soon as possible, and
between laughs and jokes with the spec
tators at the Fingslde simply rained blow
after blow upon the Californian. From
the tenth round to the finish it was sim
ply a question of whether Walcott could
hit his man often enough and hard
enough to put him out. Jackson lasted
the twenty rounds.
Jeffries Going to Los Angeles.
FRESNO, Nov. 28.âJames J. Jeffries,

HOLIDAY CROWD AT EMERYVILLE
LANDS ON WINNERS AND LOSERS
Birkenruth's Persevering Ride on Flying Torpedo the Feature of the
Sportâ Fine Shot Gets Home at Odds of 2O to Iâ Four
Choices Meet With Defeatâ Rosewar Is First for a Handicap
UNCERTAIN at all times, and
doubly so in umbrella time, rac
ing has a strong hold on the pub
lic affection, for more than 4000
enthusiasts of the sport braved
the storm and made business lively yester
dey lor the books at Oakland track. Quite
surprising was the large number of the
fair sex present in the stand, bedecked in
holiday finery and all. The fields were
just a trifle too small for the non-regu
lars, as eligible long-shots were not well
represented, and chances of "shooting at
the moon" were slight. Flying Torpedo,
with .Birkenruth in the saddle, and a 2 to
1 favorite, won the rich $2500 Thanksgiv
ing. handicap. Gusto, at short odds, took
the closing event. These were the only
favorites to score. A long shot, two sec
ond and a fourth choice earned distinc
tion in the other events. Â¦ .
'; Rain fell almost incessantly and it
poured as the five starters faced the bar
rier in the Thanksgiving handicap, at one
mile and a furlong. Flying Torpedo looked
"In" very comfortably with 97 pounds in
the saddle and enjoyed -first call through
out the betting. Favonius was scratched,
the Burns & Waterhouse folks depending
on the 88-pounder Bernota. It was the
sort of footing Sea Lion likes, and Caesar
Young's horse closed second choice. Janice
and Grayfeld had many friends, especially
the former, because of Winnie O'Connor
having the mount. Grayfeld and Janice
caused some delay at the barrier, and
when it was finally ! released Birkenruth
on Torpedo had just straightened his
mount, narrowly escaping being left, and
getting, away none too well. "Tex
Winslette quickly headed the bunch, Sea
Lion early getting a bump and falling
back. For Quite a time it did not look
very rosy for the favorite, as he trailed
along in last position. Birkenruth, though,
clung to the rail, and as Bernota and
Janice turned wide into the stretch, he
"shot across lots," and, assuming the
front position, found it easy from there
on to the wire, winning by two lengths.
In a desperate drive for the place, Johnny
Woods got Grayfeld in a nose before Ja
nice.
Louis Ezell's sprinter, Sharp Bird, fur
nished the first disappointment. The
; blinkered horse was served up a steaming
hot favorite for the introductory scram
ble. .He stopped before the stretch was
reached. See on Fine Shot, a 20 to 1 out
sider; then went on, beating Midnight
Chimes a length. Torsina ran third.
After several attempts Mat . Store
finally broke the ice, his Morello gelding,
Sunello, taking the mile selling affair at
: odds of zy-z to 1. Because of his known
fondness for the mud, The Singer was
played down to favoritism. O'Connor took
no chances with Sunello, going out in
front at the start and staying there. The
favorite finished an easy second over Par
sifal.
: Â¦ No kind of conditions seem to suit Ban
gor any more. Made favorite for the mile ,
and a quarter run. Imperious beat him in
by five open lengths, after leading from
the start. Burdoc received considerable
backing to get the show, but couldn't
beat Favorite ...
Rosewar, from the Burns & Waterhouse
stable, made a runaway race of the Shas
ta Water handicap. The filly was quoted
at 5 to 1 around post time, and led Dean
Swift out less than two lengths. Home
stead, which opened favorite, displayed no
pronounced preference for the slush, end
ing up In third position.
Last to be decided was a six-furlong
sprint, which fell to Gusto/ The Brutus
horse was installed favorite over Ben
' Ledi. and led the latter filly the entire
route. P. Ryan's Plohn ran third.

%"he young man's career was filled with
advent ures born of the recklessness that
characterized his method of living. He

away to Reno with Mrs. Brazell, sister
of his brother's wife, and was married

CATCHER SPIES
AFTER AN UMPIRE
Tries to Thrash Harper
at a Game in Los
Angeles.
Police Restrain Belligerent
Ball Player, Who Is Sent
to the Bench.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28.â The morn
ing baseball game was a procession of
Los, Angeles players around the bases un
til twenty-two runs had been scored,
while not a San Francisco man reached
home plate. Whalen literally was batted
all over the field and Brockhoff, who re
lieved him, fared no better. Hale pitched
splendid ball.
The afternoon game was of a different
sort and things were reversed so far as
Los Angeles was concerned. Besides a
close and exciting game the 5000 spectators
were treated to a first-class row on the
field. Harper's decisions were the source
of all the trouble. He was given an un
comfortable reception by the crowd. Hall,
Reilly and Spies were in turn sent to the
bench. Spies was fined $25 and it required
a policeman to restrain him from assault
ing Harper. McPartlin lost his first game,
though he pitched great ball. Score:

Birthday.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â Having re

Minister at Washington that yesterday
was the anniversary of the birthday of
the Sultan, President Roosevelt sent that
monarch a personal telegram of congrat

compliment paid him by the Sultan on the
occasion of his birthday last month. The
custom of exchanging congratulatory
messages of this kind was begun a great
many years ago and is faithfully ob
served by most of the rulers of European
governements. The late Queen Victoria

FOOD COLORING
IS NOT HARMFUL
London Authorities In
vestigate the Uae of
Preservatives.
LONDON, Nov. 28.â The Departmental
Committee of the local government board
appointed in 1899 to investigate food
preservatives and coloring materials re
ports that it is conmmon knowledge that
food producing capabilities of this coun
try do not suffice for the needs of the
population. A total prohibition of nre
serving methods is likely to be attended
with serious results to the public health,
as large quantities of food possessing
highly nutritive elements might be held
from the poorer classes or be liable to
condemnation. ' j.
The committee finds that of the preser
vative agents In common use, on one alone
rests any well founded suspicion that it
is likely to inflict injury, and the com
mittee further says that no direct evidence
of injury from the use from preservatives
has been brought before it.
The committee recommends that the use
of certain preservatives in foods or drinks
be absolutely prohibited and recommendg
the prohibition of any preservative or
coloring whatever in milk.
Mixtures of boric acid and borax, not
exceeding 0.5 per cent, are permitted in
butter and a certain class of imitation
butter.

THE EMPORIUM.
AMERICAN TRADE
UNDER REVIEW
English Commercial Rep
resentative Expounds
His Theme.
LONDON, Nov. 28.â Sixteen reporters
and six British business men gathered this
afternoon in response to the London
Chamber of Commerce's general invita
tion to hear Seymour Bell, the commercial
agent of Great Britain in the United
States, expound his theories on American
trade competition. He said that all
America wanted from abroad was daily
getting smaller, but that Great Britain
was being cut out of even this small por
tion of the market by France and Ger
many. Â»
Bell attributed this to Great Britain's
backwardness in using labor saving and
automatic machinery. He declared the
working classes of Great Britain must be
educated up to them and be convinced
that their use was essential before Great
Britain could compete with America.
Bell also said there was no doubt that
reciprocity in the United States would
result in the removal or reduction of many
of the duties now enforced, but it would
be in articles in which the United States
was quite safe from foreign competition.
Bell said there was a growing need for
tea in the United States. The fact dis
closed that the Ceylon tea merchants had
entered into a pooling arrangement for the
purpose of promoting the sale of their
brands in the United States.
The commercial agent denied the state
ment that American cement was inferior
to Portland cement.
One of the merchants present declared
that American trade was completely oust
ing British trade from Central and South
America.
Discussing what became of old men in
America, Bell said that a man over 45
years of age had' hard work to get any
position there and that this was one of
the most serious factors in the future
American business life.
Scotch whisky, it was also said, is now
being made in New York and exported
in large Quantities to South America.
Bell reassured his hearers that there

was no prejudice against British goods,
although they could not expect them to be
bought when, as is the case with agricul

lighter, more durable and cheaper. Nor
could the colonies be "blamed for patron
izing America in preference to Great
Britain in this branch of machinery. He

INDUSTRIAL CONTESTS.
WITH Thanksgiving there came a bountiful
rain, and while most of our people would
have preferred to have it on some other day
than the holiday, yet all will recognize it was some
thing to give thanks for. Showers at this season
mean a good deal for all classes of people. They
prepare the way for the prosperity that is to come,
and we can well afford to sacrifice a race or a foot
ball match once in a while for the sake of a genuine
downpour oi showers in all parts of the State.
The prosperity that prevails in the United States,
and particularly that enjoyed in California, can hard
ly be understood in full measure unless note is taken
of the contrast presented by the conditions of the
peoples of Europe, not to speak of those in other
parts of the world. Reports from those countries
are full of accounts of bad times now and forebodings
of worse to come. We with our present and pros
pective blessings are unquestionably the most for
tunate of the dwellers on the earth.
Great Britain is worn by a wearisome and vex
atious guerrilla war which costs enormously, and
which may last for a year to come, or perhaps even
for a longer time. By reason of that wat her peo
ple are burdened with taxation heavier than ever,
and with an, increase of public debt at a juncture
when advancing rivalry in industry and trade menaces
many of her manufacturers and merchants with ruin.
So far from being able to find easy markets in other
countries for their goods, the British now perceive
their own markets invaded, and thousands of their
workingmen threatened with a loss of employment
Among the Germans affairs industrially are per
haps even worse than in Great Britain, though they
have no war upon their hands to waste their earn
ings and to increase their debts and their taxes. It
is stated that something like a collapse has fallen
upon the industry of the empire^ A similar situa
tion :s found in Austria. So serious has become the
demand for employment among the workingmen that
the Government has been forced to undertake an
extensive system of internal improvements in order
to provide work for those who need it. The work,
uowever, cannot be started at once, and a recent re
port from Vienna says the industrial situation is ex
tremely unsatisfactory, and the number of the un
employed is rapid'y increasing.
Worst of all is the situation in Russia. In that
country it is becoming apparent that the famine
which affects so many populous districts is to be
much worse than was expected by the Government,
and the preparations made for the relief of the peo
ple will be found insufficient A recent St. Peters
burg dispatch fays:
The reports from many provinces show the dry au
tumn has disastrously affected the new sowing. From
Tomsk. West Siberia, are reported local crop failures
and a flight of the peasants back to European Russia.
The assignment of money (15,000 rubles) and grain is
declared to be insufficient, and the hungry peasants
have been driven to robbery and even murder. Deeds
of violence are declared to be of daily occurrence.
Such is the condition that prevails throughout
northern Europe from Great Britain to Russia.
Southern Europe fares little better. In no other
land is there for labor or for capital such good con
ditions now or such bright prospects for the imme
diate future as prevail here. Between our situation
and that of any other people there is a sharp con
trast. We have only to look abroad to see how
much we have to be thankful for at home.
An American correspondent who has been looking
over affairs in South Africa says the outer world
knows nothing of the situation there because both the
British and the Boers have been lying; but he ad
mits there is a good deal of ruction in the country,
so there must be some truth in what we have heard.
From the way in which peeresses and the rich
American women in London are buying gems for the
coronation spectacular display, it looks as if the
diamond trade wouid have a boom worth talking
about
RIGHTS OF SCHOOL TEACHERS.
COMMENTING upon the decision of the Su
perior Court in the Dwyer case, one of our
evening contemporaries declares it amounts
to a decision that the School Board has no right to
interfere in a quarrel between teachers, and adds:
'"Should the Supreme Court, if the matter be finally
referred to that tribunal, sustain the attitude of the
lower court, every contentious teacher in the depart
ment would enjoy a free rein to vent his or her spleen
on those with whom he or she was unable to agree,
without incurring the risk of punishment from the
Board of Directors, who employ and pay teachers
their salaries."
That statement of the decision is not accurate,
and the conclusions drawn from it are utterly er
roneous. The Dwyer case arose out of a controversy
in which one school teacher was charged with slap
ping another teacher in the face. The only point
decided by the court is that a single display of tem
per on the part of a teacher does not constitute "in
competency, unprofessional or immoral conduct,"
nor is it a violation of The rules of the Board of
Education as provided for in section 179*3 of the
Political Code.
It is not contended that a display of temper on
the part of a teacher in the presence of her pupils
or otherwise may not be a cause of a reprimand from
the Board of Education, nor is it 'contended that fre
quent and repeated displays of temper might not so
impair the usefulness of a teacher as to render her
unfit to teach, and thus liable to dismissal; but it is
contended that a single display of temper is not a
statutory ground for dismissal, and that was the
only point involved in the Dwyer case.
Our contemporary in its eagerness to make a point
against the court and against the school teachers goes
so far as to say: "A large commercial house â and
the Board of Education is purely a business organi
zation â if properly conducted demands harmony
among its employes and unflinching loyalty to those
in charge. A clerk or bookkeeper whose private life
reflects dishonor on his employers or whose office
behavior breeds discord and contention among his
associates is often dismissed without trial or investi
gation. And so it should be in the. management of
the school department. The School Board should
have full authority to remove at any time it sees
fit those whose behavior is in conflict with the rules
of the department."
Should such a policy be adopted the spoils system
would be set up in the School Department in its
worst forgi. The department is not private business
but public business. It must be conducted not ac
cording to personal whim and caprice, but accord
ing to law. A bookkeeper of a private firm, as our
contemporary says, may be dismissed by his em
ployer without trial or investigation, though it would
be an unfair employer who would do it; but our
school teachers are fortunately not subject to such
arbitrary removal. Were it otherwise the positions
and the salaries of the department would be the prey
of politician*, and no teacher would be secured from
unjust removal at any time.
Clerks and other employes in the various branches
of the city government hold their office under civil
service regulations, and can be removed only when
good cause for the removal has been shown. Yet
our contemporary would rob 'the public school
teachers of the independent tenure of. office they now
enjoy, and would reduce them to a condition of
something like servility to politicians; for that would
surely be the result if their tenure of office were made
dependent upon the pleasure of the Board of Edu
cation.
Even with the safeguards which have been thrown
around the teachers' tenure of office by the law and
by the decision of the Supreme Court in the Ken
nedy case, the position is still far from being one
of security. It has frequently been the case that
the trial of a teacher by the board has not been a
full and fair hearing of all the evidence relating to
the accusations, but simply a form which the board
has gone through for the purpose of registering
against the teacher a decision which has been already
agreed upon in secret caucus.
The law cannot too carefully guard the indepen
dence <ft the teachers of the public schools, and it
isÂ«gratifying to note that the decision in the Dwyer
case, like that in the Kennedy case, is a proof that
the courts recognize that the intention of the law is
to secure that independence, and construe it accord
ingly*
The Conservative recommends that the "regener
ated Democracy" of New York support for President
in 1904 Charles S. Fairchild, formerly Secretary of the
Treasury, and should the recommendation be followed
Senator Jones' desire for an "obscure candidate"
would have a chance to be realized.
TALES OF TWO FAMILIES.
RECENT news reports have brought to light
tales of two families which taken as they ap
pear in the reports show striking contrasts of
human nature. One of these tells of a woman who
served as a nurse and governess for the Roosevelts,
and the other of a woman who held a similar posi
tion in the family of John D. Rockefeller, the Stan
dard Oil magnate. Their contrast is sufficiently not
able to merit at least a passing comment.
The Roosevelt story comes from New York and
is to the effect that when in that city recently the
President called at a flat where an old family s?rvant
is lying iIL His call was due to concern felt id.- the
woman who had been the nurse of his children and
of the mother before them. She has not been in
any way neglected by the President. His call was
not one of condolence merely. The old servant is
under the care of skillful and careful nurses whose
services are paid for by the President. He and his
wife, however, have not been content to employ
others to look after the woman who has so long
been in their service. Both the President and Mrs.
Roosevelt have called upon her whenever they have
had an opportunity to do so, and even the business
engagements of the Presidency have not been per
mitted to prevent them from finding such oppor
tunity.
The Rockefeller story is local. There was recent
ly taken to the Central Hospital in this city a woman
eighty years of age, suffering from a fractured hip,
caused by a fall. This woman was employed as a
domestic in the family of John D. Rockefeller in the
days when he was earning his livelihood as a clerk.
Soon after leaving his household wealth came to
Rockefeller and distress to the nurse. He is now
rich enough to maintain an ostentatious philan
thropy, but the nurse who served in his family has
been taken to the County Hospital, where she will
be cared for at the public expense.
Upon these contrasted stories little comment is
needed. It is a dull brain and a duller heart that can
not draw the moral. It is # a frequent complaint that
in these later days the relations between the employer
and the employed are losing all the former feeling
THK SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAT, jsOVEMBEK 29, 1901.
of a mutual loyalty to one another; that the relation
is becoming a mere matter of dollars and cents; that
the employer cares nothing for the employe who
breaks down in the service, but dismisses him with
indifference to whatsoever treatment he may receive
from the public hospitals and asylums. The story
of the Rockefeller family servant gives confirmation
to the complaint, but the story of the Roosevelts
confutes it. The relations among men have not
yet become wholly matters of bargain and hire.
There are still genuine affections in the household
for those who serve it faithfully, and it is gratifying
to see that affection manifest in the family of the
President of the republic.
About the only thing that Chicago has to brag
about at this time is a $50,000,000 Bible-class, with a
Rockefeller at the head of it, but they seem to use the
thing more as a means of impressing outsiders than
as a local incentive to a religious life.
CANNON AE I M G HAILSTORMS.
SOME time ago The Call directed attention to
the official statements of Chief Moore of the
Wer.ther Bureau concerning the alleged suc
cess achieved in certain wine districts in Europe in
breaking up hailstorms by firing cannon. It is
therefore worth noting that it is now reported that
the Swiss Government, after investigating the sub
iect, has reached the conclusion that the cannonading
Las a beneficial effect, and the practice 'is recom
mended for adoption in Switzerland.
Chief Moore's condemnation of the scheme was
based upon seemingly indisputable grounds. He
maintained that the forces of nature that build up
and direct a hailstorm are altogether too powerful to
be dissipated by any cannonading that man could do.
He recalled the experiments made in this country in
the effort to bring about a fall of rain by discharging
cannons and bombs of one kind or another, and ex
pressed a conviction that the vineyardists of Europe
were merely repeating the experiment and would
have no more success than was attained by the rain
makers in this country.
The reasoning of the chief was* clear and valid, but
the report made to the Swiss Government is suffi
ciently strong to raise a question whether there may
not be certain forces set in operation by vigorous
cannonading which are capable of achieving effects
much greater than scientists suppose possible. It is
not to be forgotten that very able men said it would
be impossible to make a locomotive run on a rail
road, others equally wise ridiculed the idea of lighting
a city by burning gas, and even in our own time there
were scientific men to deny the feasibility of wire
less telegraphy. It is therefore sometimes worth
while making an experiment, even though scientists
ridicule it.
In the summary that comes to us of the report to
the Swiss Government the Commissioners are quoted
as sayiig: "A direct proof that hail-shooting prop
erly practiced will under all circumstances prevent
hail is of course impossible to furnish; but the fact
that certain districts of Styria, which were before the
use of hail-guns devastated by hailstorms year by
year, have not for the last five years, since the guns
are in use, experienced any hail, is a strong point in
favor of the hail-guns."
The justice of that conclusion can hardly be de
nied. The Swiss Commissioners are reported as ad
mitting that the effect of the "air ring" which is shot
into the hail clouds has not yet been satisfactorily
or sufficiently explained; but they say that from
Styria, where it started, the system has spread
throughout Hungary and into many parts of Italy and
France, everywhere justifying its cost, at least to the
minds of those upon whom the expense falls.
Such is the Tecord as. it comes to us. If it be said
that no test has ever been scientifically made, then
certainly upon such evidence as that given it is time
to make one. California is not much affected by
storms, so the experiments may be of no great value
to us, but it is unquestionably worth while to try the
effect of the hail-gun upon the Â¦various kinds of
storms and tornadoes that do so much damage in the
Mississippi Valley.
The President can do many things and do most of
them well, but he might as well give up the attempt
to get the people of this country to call his name
"Rosyvelt."
MILITIA REORGANIZATION.
SECRETARY ROOT will make another effort
to bring about such a reorganization of the
militia of the country as will render it more
fitted Â£o meet the exigencies of modern war. Many
of his predecessors in the War Office have made
similar efforts. Revision of the militia law has been
a standing subject of discussion at Washington for
a period so # long that there is probably not a man
now in the service of the office who can recall a time
when the discussion was not.
The Secretary states in his annual report to the
President that our militia law stands to-day practi
cally as it was enacted in 1792. That is a very long
time for a statute to remain unaltered and un
amended in this mutable world. There have been
great changes in the nation and in the art of war
since 1792. It is not necessary to read the statute to
know that it is now obsolete, out of date, ineffective
and worthless. Its very age condemns it. Should it
be found to have any virtue in it for use in a war
of our time it would be more wonderful than the
famous one-horse shay that ran a hundred years to
a day, for the statute has run more than a century. It
stands a good chance of rounding out the first decade
of a second century.
The Secretary says: "The reliance of the country
for the large forces necessary in modern warfare
must necessarily be chiefly upon volunteers. The
method and procedure of raising the volunteer force
should be prescribed in advance, so that instead of
waiting to devise plans for a volunteer army until the
excitement and haste of impending war make per
fection of design difficult, and satisfactory execution
impossible, Congress will have but to direct the
execution of a well understood plan by officers, each
of whom has long, been familiar with the part he has
to play."
Arguments of that kind are convincing to the
public, but somehow they seem to have but little
weight with Congress, and as a consequence the old
statute- of 1792 still stands as the militia law of the
nation. Surely this Congress can be counted on to
find time to enact a new one.
By reason of the heavy tax placed upon private
gardens in Paris it is said many of the old nobility are
unable to stand the expense arjd several of them have
arranged to turn the gardens into building lots and
put up rows of apartment houses. The lovers of the
old order of things are of course howling, but it
looks as if the city in the end would be improved by
the change.
IMPOSSIBLE TO SIGNAL
INTELLIGENTLY TO MARS
ASTRONOMER SIR ROBERT BALL, WHO SAYS THERE HAS BEEN
NO PROOF OF LIFE ON MARS AND THAT EFFORTS TO SIGNAL
THAT PLANET ARE FUTILE.
SIR ROBERT STANWELL BALL, the eminent Irish astronomer and physicist,
in a lecture in Philadelphia recently dwelt at some length on the planet
Mars, and the possibility of ever being able to communicate with that plan
et's inhabitants.
"One needs only remember," he said, "that the largest building in the world,
If magnified more than 1000 times, then transported to Mars, and when viewed by
the most experienced astronomers here, under the most favorable atmospheric
conditions, with the most up-to-date apparatus, would appear merely as a speckâ
a speck no larger than a pin head.
"Again, in order to attract the attention of the sharpest eye on Mars, and it
would then be necessary for that eye to be diligently watching for a signal,
some one on the earth would have to wave a flag 200 miles long, 300 miles wide,
and shake all this on a flagpole 750 miles long. If a person on Mars were looking
Just at that time, he might see a speck, but nothing more.
"Cover all the Great Lakes with pitch and then fire them, it would be but a
speck to those on Mars.
"With su^h. statements before me," said Dr. Ball, "how can the idea of signal
ing to Mars, so that the signs may be intelligible, ever gain lodgment with
thoughtful, sensible people?"
While Dr. Ball said the proof of life on Mars had never been given, he
thought the conditions were such that life could exist there. The regions of ice
and snow are .changeable in extent during the summer and winter of Mars. What
apparently ueem to be clouds are made out as such, and well defined boundaries
of continents are strongly impressed upon one. Again, during the period when
the ice and snow on Mars melts, an interlocking system of canals may be seen at
certain seasons. These will be seen to converge from ail corners at certain places
called oases. What the significance of these canals may be has not been made
out. That they indicate the lines along which life and vegetation thrive and exist
is a statement not too great for belief.

TOO MUCH GEARY.
Editor The Call: I have but indignation
and contempt for the doings of the Anti-
Chinese Convention. I am certain this
opinion is shared by a majority of my fel
low citizens. With one accord the people
desire the exclusion of the Mongolian race
from the United States. The "Geary bill"
is out of date. The less we have to do
with Geary, if the history of the muti
lated Needham telegram be true, the bet
ter it will be for the country.
The fixed purpose of the people is: T>
bar admission to every breed and variety
of Asiatics. The proceedings of the con
vention were palpably cowardly and
representative. The Japanese are a
greater menace than the Chinese. I
assimilate, and, not forming thems
into a colony as the Chinese do, are sand
wiching themaeives, as laborers, artificers
and merchants, among the inhabitants of
the choicest portions of the city. We Â«
not arrest their offensive burrowing fd^M
quickly. The Congressional representa
tion of this coaat numbers about twenty,
who are thoroughly familiar with the
question. What need of assistant repre
sentatives? Are our delegates feeble
minded, or are the 300 statesmen of the
East senseless to the requirements of their
country and dead to the duties which de
volve upon them in securing, with en
hanced glory, the perpetuity of American
institutions?

BUENA VISTA PARLOR OF NATIVE DAUGHTERS
INDUCED TO REPEAT MINSTREL PERFORMANCE
Black-Face Show to
Be Given in Aid
of the Home
Fresh Jokes and Songs
Being Rehearsed
by Ladies*
THE minstrel show that was recent
ly given by members of Buena
Vista Parlor, Native Daughters of
the Golden West. In Native Sons'
Hall, is to be repeated on Monday
night next, in the same hall, for the bene
fit of the Native Daughters' Home, an
institution that is destined to take a place
among the gTeat ones of this city.
This institution, which was opened in a
modest way some time ago, is growing in
importance, and under the management
of the home committee, consisting of Mrs.
W. S. Leake (chairman) and Mrs. H. M.
Greene, Dr. Mariana Bartola and Mrs.
Louis Morris of San Francisco and Miss
Clara K. AVittenmeyer of Mills College, it
is shaping itself into a home in fact as
well as in name, one that is intended to
provide for members of the order a place
equipped with all that one may desire to
find in one's own home. The matron ex
ercises motherly care and the members
of the home committee make daily visits
and look after the welfare of all who find
an abiding place in the home. The com
mittee members carefully study all things
that will conduce to the comfort of the
guests. The demand for accommodations
at the Native Daughters' Home has be
come so great that those in charge are
anxious to secure more commodious quar-
ters, but do not feel warranted at this
time in touching a nest egg that is the
beginning of a building fund, or of going
into debt to make a change, if it should
be decided to make one.
Mrs. Genevieve Watson Baker, the
grand president of the order, who has
aiways taken a deep interest in the home
and is a member of Buena Vista Parlor,
suggested, as did others shortly after the
recent grand minstrel show given by the
members of the parlor, that a Christmas
present could be provided for the home
by repeating the performance. The sug
gestion was approved by all who had
aided in giving the show. The matter was
laid before the home committee. The
proposition was gratefully accepted and
all the parlors were notified of the move
ment, with a request that each lend its
influence to help the project. From the
responses that have been received it is
apparent that not only the parlors in the
city, but those in the interior, are assist
ing in the good work. It is probable that a
goodly sum will be obtained for the home,
and possibly the returns will decide
whether one of the houses adjoining the
present home shall be rented and added
to it or whether the money realized shall
be added to the building fund.
The young ladies who are to take part
in the show are Misses Alice Ticoulet.

SAYS MILLIONS
WILL BE SPENT
Former Attorney Gen
eral Talks of Gigan
tic Project.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 28.â Immense iron and
Bteel works, for which $11,000,000 capital is
reported to have been actually subscribed,
are projected for Alviso or somewhere
near tide water in that neighborhood.
This at least is what ex- Attorney General
W. H. H. Hart states about a proposed
plant of extraordinary size on the east
ern bay shore.
Thousands of men, he says, will be
employed in working up iron ore, which,
he declares, has been found at the head
waters of the San Joaquin River, and
which will be bspught to the plant by a
proposed railroad nearly 300 miles long.
Hegarding the $11,000,000 which is declared
to have been subscribed to the stock al
ready, Hart intimates that this is but a
mere fraction of the amount of capital
available. Hetty Green, the richest
woman in the world; the Vanderbilts and
Goulds are said to be interested in the
project. Hart also intimates that a great
shipyard may be established.
Hart, who is a resident of Palo Alto,
gave this information to Assessor L. A.
Spitzer yesterday. He said:
"Your county may have a big iron and
steel manufactory. A company in which
1 am interested has found iron ore near
the headwaters of the San Joaquin, and
after the discovery was made experts
were sent out to the place. They returned
with the report that it was the largest
deposit of iron ore in California and was
of the very best quality. The parties I
represent immediately went East to see
what could be done to get Eastern cap
italists interested. They had no trouble
in presenting the matter. The capitalists
immediately sent experts to the big find
and their report was even better than
that made by our own men. After the
report was made Eastern capitalists sub
scribed $11,000,000 in one day. Hetty
Green subscribed $4,000,000, the Vander
bilts put their name down for $2,000,000
and the Goulds subscribed $1,000,000. The
balance was subscribed by equally promi
nent New York millionaires.
"Thus far it has not been decided where
The bride was given away by her
brother-in-law, Police Officer John Flem
ming. After the ceremony had been per
formed the young couple, together with
about fifty of their friends and relatives,
partook of a wedding- supper.
Mr. Lehrke is a well known and promi
nent young business man of this city.
Hils bride is a popular and accomplished
young lady. The honeymoon will be spent
at Del Monte. The bride was the recip
ient of many beautiful and costly pres
ents.
the works will be erected, but those who
are interested want the buildings located
around the bay in either Alameda or
Santa Clara County. There has been
some talk of selecting a site near Alviso,
and Dumbarton Point, just over the line
in Alameda County, has also been spoken
of as a possible place for the plant. It
will necessitate the building of a railroad
from the mines to the steel and iron
plant, the distance being about 260 miles."
Hart declared to those present that he
was talking seriously and that the pro
ject would be soon perfected. Beyond his
statement nothing is known here of the
project.
AMOUNT OF THE SHORTAGE
IS NOT YET ASCERTAINED
Experts Still "Working on Books of
Louisville Treasurer Who Com
mitted Suicide.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 28.â Beyond
the statement made last night to Mayor
Granger by one of the expert account
ants that a shortage amounting to $23,000
had been found in the books of the form
er City Treasurer, Stuart R. Young, wtro
committed suicide yesterday, nothing
definite is known as to how the accounts
stand between the city and its former
treasurer. It is said that the accountants
will require two weeks of constant work
to go over the books. During his four
years' term as City Treasurer Young
handled $11,000,000.
There were various reports to-day as
to the amount of the alleged shortage,
some placing it at $50,000 and some even
higher, but they are all surmises, accord
ing to the men who are examining the
books.
Czar Receives Marquis Ito.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 28.â The Czar
granted an audience to Marquis Ito, the
Japanese statesman, this afternoon, and
later Count Lamsdorft, the Russian For

of the visitors.
An effective entente between Russia and
Japan is regarded as the probable out
come of the audience between the Czar
and Marquis Ito, although it is not an
ticipated that permanent or binding ob
ligations will be undertaken by either gov
ernment. ,
Baronet Purchases Battle Abbey.
LONDON, Nov. 28.â The mystery sur

owner is a descendant of Sir Thomas
Webster, who bought the abbey from
Viscount Montague .in 1719, and whose
family retained possession of it for 130

LEPERS MAKE
GRAVE CHARGES
Molokai Colonists Claim
That Food Supplies
Are Scant.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 28.â The lep
ers of Malokai have threatened to make
trouble for the authorities of the islands,
according to advices received to-day from
Honolulu by the steamer Miowera.
Letters from educated men among the
lepers declare that extensive scandals in
connection with the supplying of food to
the lepers would result were an investi
gation held. They complain bitterly about
the food that is furnished, and the let
ters severely censure the Board of Health
for alleged neglect in supplying them with
the necessaries of life. A mass meeting
of lepers was held recently at Kalaupapa,
which is the largest station in the Ha
waiian Islands, and a committee of five
was chosen to lay complaints against the
authorities, and to take the initiative in
prosecuting certain officials.
Among the more rabid in the colony the
opinion was freely expressed that the lep
ers should lead an outbreak which would
soon bring the authorities to time. The
committee asks that the conduct of the
Board of Health be inquired into by a
State commission. The lepers contend
that the drinking water formerly supplied
them in pipes has been diverted for com
mercial purposes, and the result is very
trying on their malady.

A SUDDEN southeaster made trou

Vessels were thrown from post to

captains did not know what was

boats thought they were in danger and en
one occasion looked for the life belts,
â¢while the tugboats were kept busy moving
vessels to a safe anchorage.
The T. C. Walker was driven against
the wharf and nearly sank at her moor

these vessels learned what a gale is. On
tht: Bay City there was almost a panic,
as the vessel was on her beam ends for a
few seconds. It is hard to put a side
wheeler in that position, but for a few
seconds the port wheel of the fcrryboa;
was out of water and the engines had to
be slopped on account of the pressure.
A great" scare was the result and the pas
sengers thought the vessel was gom?
dewn. For a few minutes there was al
most a panic, but gradually everybody
c?.nie to their senses. Had they known
more about vessels they would have felt
as safe as if in a church, for the bottom
pi&y drop out of a ferryboat but the upper
works will float.
T. C. Walker in Trouble.
The Stockton steamer T. C. Walker was
nearly wrecked during the gaie. Dur
ing- the early hours of the morning she at
tempted to make Washingtun-street
wharf. The wind and tide vÂ»ere both
against her and she was swept down on
the Dolphin. The impact proved disastrous
to the steamboat, as nearly fprty feet of
her railing and "gingerbread ' work was
carried away and the upper decks were
seriously damaged. The wharf did not
suffer to any great extent. The Walker
was sent to the shipyard for an over
hauling and it will be several weeks be
fore she is ready to go Into commission
again.
Government Vessels in Trouble.
The Fish Commissioners' steamer Alba
tross and the training ship Ranger had a
narrow escape during yesterday's south
easter. Both vessels were anchored off
Folsom-street wharf and when the turn
of the tide came they almost touched. As
the barometer was falling the captain of
the Albatross sent for a tug and the
Alert moved the vessel away from the
vicinity of the Ranger. Ship captains
think that the southeaster has only just
begun to blow.
Water Front Notes.
A party from the Ris.don Iron Works
was to have gone out for a pleasure trip
on "Risdon No. 3" yesterday, but the
southeaster deterred them.
The work of raising the ferry steamer
Dauntless has been delayed owing to the
breaking of the timbers that connected
the floats. Pontoons are being used to
raise the vessel and these are held to
gether by long beams. When the strain
came the beams broke and the vessel
sank back to the river bed.
The revenue cutter Bear goes from here
to Mare Island, where she will be fitted
with a new refrigerating plant and an
electric light ?lant.
Edward Brown was robbed of $7 on
Front street yesterday. Two men knocked
him down and went through his pockets.
This is Brown's story, but when found
on the sidewalk he was too drunk to give
a connected account of the robbery. The
police doubt his story.
War against the pool-sellers has reached

the front. Yesterday officers were de
tailed to watch 16 and 34 East street. At
both of these places pools are known to
have been sold and in consequence a strict
boycott was put on the places yesterday.
Dr. Rozsars of GOl Telegraph avenue,
Oakland, was struck by a Haight-street
car at the ferries yesterday. He was not
seriously injueed, but was cared for at
the Harbor Iflttrpital.
A lad named James Carpmill was
stabbed in the leg on Harrison-street
wharf yesterday. He and some youngsters
engaged in a fight through a discussion
about the flying of the Stars and Stripes
on Thanksgiving Day and the result was
a fracas. Carpmill was not seriously in
jured.
The steamship Humboldt arrived from
the Sound yesterday. She will lay ur
here for the winter and may go into the

PRESBYTERIANS
TO REVISE CREED
Committee Meets to Dis
cuss Contemplated
Changes.
Will Draft a Form of State
ment to Replace th 9
One Now in Use.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â The prelim
inary work of revising the creed of the
Presbyterian church so as to make it
more popularly understood was begun
here to-day at a meeting of a section of
the committee of twenty appointed at the
last Presbyterian Assembly to accomp
lish this result. The section that met to
day spent several hours in discussion, but
no action was taken. Rev. Dr. Herrick
Johnson of Chicago presided and the
other members who participated were
Rev. Drs. Minton of San Francisco and
Specher of Cleveland and Justice Harlan
of the United States Supreme Court.
A form cf statement to replace the one
now In use was submitted and other forms
will likely be submitted. The object is to
secure a formal expression of doctrine
that will be more definite and convey to
the laymen a clearer idea of the subject
than the present declaration. No vital
changes were contemplated in to-day's
discussion, but may be a different mode
of expression was aimed at. It was rec
ognized that the 250 years that have
elapsed since the adoption of the present
statement of doctrine has made some dif
ferences in the conception of the authori
ties. There was some discussion as to the
incorporation of a statement regarding
the personality of God, but this proposi
tion is still a tentative one.
Tlrs section will hold another session
to-morrow and will meet dally until
Wednesday, when the full committee will
convene with a view to taking final ac
tion. Whether the deliberations of the full
committee will occupy a week or a num
ber of weeks is still conjectural. Two
other secttons of the committee will meet
contemporaneously with the other body
and will frame a proposition for action by
that body. One of these will draft new
chapters on the Holy Spirit and on the
love of God, and the other will make a
slight revision of the confession of faith
with reference to the elect infants' decla
ration. It is felt that the present state
ment on this point implies that any in
fant dying in infancy is "lost" from the
standpoint of the religious future state,
and that the creed to be adopted will
make It clear that the Presbyterian
church does not hold the belief that those
who die in infancy are lost. This change
will be effected probably by a specific
declaratory statement, though possibly by
amending the present tax.
GOVERNOR TAFT WELL PAY
VISIT TO UNITED STATES
Cablegram From Manila Announces
That the Skin Grafting Opera
tion Proved Successful.
CINCINNATI, Nov. 28.â Congressman
Charles P. Taft, publisher of the Times-
Star and a brother of the Governor Gen
eral of the Philippines, to-day received a
cablegram from Manila stating that Sur
geons Stafford and Rhodes have success

G. Schmidlap, the banker, had expected to
leave this week on a tour around the
world, their objective point being a visit
to Governor Taft at Manila. They have
postponed their trip indefinitely on ad
vices from Manila and arrangements will
be made to give Governor Taft a reception
here on his return.
SNAKE INDIANS CREATE
CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
Will Send Delegation to Washington
to Protest Against Deeding
Creek Lands.
GUTHRIE, Okla., Nov. 2S.â A special to
the Capital from Tusla, I. T., says: Crazy
Snake, who led the rebellion last spring

ing of Creek lands.
A joint resolution was passed to-day
by both Houses of the Creek Council de
manding that deeds be issued immediate
ly and at Okmulgee instead of Muskogee.
The treaty of last May promised deeds
immediately and the Indians cn!y ask
justice.
The Dawes commission is unable to han
dle the auestion.
An Accomplice of Bresci.
ROME, Nov. 28. â The newspaper Fan
fulla credits Sfgnor Gioletti, Minister of
the Interior, with the statement that

According to a dispatch to the Asso
ciated Press from Milan, November 25.
Louis Granotti, an accomplice of Bresci,

RUNS FOR LIFE
FROM POWDER
Narrow Escape From
Death of Mine Su
perintendent.
GRASS VALLET. Nov. 2S.â Three hun
dred pounds of giant powder and a large
quantity of giant caps blew up at the La
Suerte mine, three miles from Nevada
City last night, completely wrecking the
modern hoisting plant. Superintendent
Kirkham had a narrow escape from a ter
rible death and the night snift crew was
almost entombed.
Sparks from a smokestack caused the
disaster and burning embers set the hoist
ing works roofs on fire. Seeing that the
building was doomed Superintendent
Kirkham tried to prevent the powder and
caps stored in a pump alongside the burn
ing works from exploding. The sparks
falling about powder kegs threatened an
instant explosion and the superintendent
ran from the fcurning building. He had
hardly gone fifty feet when the whole
mass of explosives caught and went off
with a roar that was heard miles away.
Kirkham was knocked down but was not
injured, although heavy pieces of iron and
wreckage were flying in all directions. The
roof of the hoisting works was thrown
hundreds of feet in the air.
The miners down in the works heard
and felt the explosion and escaped by
means of the drain tunnel. The property
is owned by San Francisco men. The
damage is estimated at $20,000.
Ends His Life With Acid.
GRASS VALLEY. Nov. 28.â George
Townsend committed suicide yesterday at
the home of his father-in-law. George
Moulton, some miles south of here. He
procured a bottle of carbolic acid and
drank a large portion of it before the bot
tle was knocked from his hand. Domes
tic troubles are supposed to have been
the cause of the suicide. Townsend wa?
a native of this city, aged 33 years, and
leaves a wife and two children.
Fortification Nearly Completed.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. Â».â The second forti
fication at the entrance of Sen Diego will
be finished next Saturday. It includes
two rapid-firing fifteen-pound three-inch
guns, commanding- the entrance to the
harbor. The emplacement is fifteen feet
high, 100 feet long and forty feet wide.
There are four chambers, including mag
azine room and storage room. The guns

JAMESTOWN, Nov. 28.â Fire broke out

AUSTRALIANS
SCORE BRITONS
Alleged Mistreatment of
Bushmen Stirs In
dignation.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 28.â There is
a great storm of indignation throughout
Australia, according to statements in the
Sydney papers arriving to-day by the
steamer Miowera, on account of the im
prisonment of fourteen members of the
Australian Mounted Bushmen for alleged
mutinous conduct in South Africa.
Several troops of the mounted men were
sent from Australia to ngnt against the
Boers, and it is contended that if the Aus
tralians knew what kind of treatment
would have been meted out to their men
they would never have sent them along
so generously. At a banquet after one
of the British victories in South Africa
Colonel Beatson said that the Australians
were "a lot of white-livered curs." Sev
eral colonial officers who were present
arose in a body and demanded a retrac
tion. This was denied and the colonel
proceeded with the remark that the offi
cers r/ere not much better.
The men resented this and refused duty
under the colonel. Fourteen were ordered
| by court-martial to be shot, but this sen
' tence was changed by Lord Kitchener to
twelve years in jail in England.
The Australian papers declare that this
is an outrage and that if this sentence
should be carried otrt, without interfer
ence from the War Office, the Australian
Government will be quite justified i= de
manding the recall of every Australian
soldier serving against the Boers.

SONGS AND SERMONS OF GLAD THANKSGIVING
GIVEN VOICE IN PRAISE OF BENEFICENT DEITY
Union Services Held in
Many Places of
Worship
Congregations of Dif
ferent Sects Meet
Together*
THANKSGIVING devoutness and
Thanksgiving cheer went hand
in hand yesterday and the tradi
tions of the day did not suffer
neglect. Though the sun scarce
ly burst through the pall of clouds at any
time during the day there was joy
aplenty in thousands of hearts, for some
felt reverently their debt of gratitude for
blessings the year had brought them and
many had reason to be glad that at some
seasons more than others are the unfortu
nate remembered.
The churches held Thanksgiving ser
vices that were well attended in spitt- of
the downpour of rain. Hymns of thanks
giving were sung and ministers recounted
the year's blessings and reminded the
worshipers of the less tangible favors,
of which the average man loses sight
while he counts off his material blessings
on his ringers.
Many union- services were held, gener
ally by the churches of the same de
nomination, but in several instances con
gregations of many sects joined together
in their Thanksgiving praises.
At the orphanages the little ones were
made happy by bounteous dinners and
the company of sweet women who gave
up a part of the day to lend cheer to the
children's dinner Hour.
Out at the Presidio the boys in blue sat
in their mess hall? and made merry over
turkey dinners, with plum puddings and
ir.iv.ee pies, that made them think of the
old home and the little mother back in
New. England or in Tennessee or the
Northwest who cooked such a dinner .lust
a little better than the greatest of chefs.

' ter.ary Methodist Episcopal. West Side
Christian, First New Jerusalem and Ham
ilton Square Baptistâ worshiped at the
Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church
South at 11 o'clock.
The sermon was preached by the Rev.
Dr. F. B. Oherington. and special music
was sung by the choir of the Centenary
Church. Rev. Dr. E. Neiander read the
Thanksgiving proclamation, the Rev. An
ci?â¬\v Parsons read the Scripture lesson,
the Rev. Walter M. White gave the
prayer, and the Rev. Edward J. Harper
saia the benediction.
L'r. Cherington in hi<= sermon said in
part:
There can be no real thanksgiving that is
not voluntary. So to-day we are called to
gether all over the country in a voluntary
thanksgiving. If we believe that God is stand
ing behind the long chain of our blessings,
then thanks are due him. If we believe that
God is not the giver of our good, then such
service is a mockery; but we believe he i;--,
and we come to renew our faith and allegiance.
It is noteworthy how science has changed its
attitude toward Christianity. Its present
great men have brought back and enthroned
the Â£r>irtual life in the world of matter. The
relation of scientific thought toward prayer
has s!?o changed, and recent scientific books
breathe a spirit in line with the devoutest
thought of Christianity.
Xo philosoohy can ever solve all questions,
can ever account for al! facts. There must
always be room for doubt, but the Bible phil
osophy solves most questions, settle s most
doubts, accounts for most facts, and so we
accept the Bible philosophy and feel that we
are in line with the ripest thought of civiliza
tion.
G'd's acenjntants crowd thickly around us
to-day, asking. "How much owest thou my
Lord?" Let Uf- not be guilty of Ingratitude,
but look straight at the facts and see how
many of our blessings are due to our God.
If we have had good health, it is common to
thank our physician or the skill of some great
surgeon, but let us not forget that in a thou

from Christ himself the lines of light that will
afford a solution of the vexatious problem. Let
the peoole only remember to avoid violence,

THANKSGIVING SPIRIT.
Calvary Presbyterian and First Con
gregational Meet Together.
The congregation of the Calvary Pres
byterian Church joined with that of the
First Congregational Church yesterday
morning in holding Thanksgiving service.
For a number of years it has been the
custom of these two congregations, al
though of different religious denomina
tions, to unite in offering up their thanks.
The serviceÂ»was held in the First Congre
gational Church, the pulpit of which was
tastefully decorated with evergreens and
chrysanthemums. The music was spec
ially selected for the occasion and con
sisted of anthems and hymns of praise
and thanksgiving. This part of the ser
vice was conducted by Samuel D. Mayer,
organist and director of the choir.
As a prelude to the sermon and as an
appropriate explanation of the purpose of
the union service, the Rev. George C
Adams, pastor of the First Congregational
Church, read President Roosevelt's
Thanksgiving proclamation. He accom
panied the reading with a few remarks
testifying to the friendly spirit which had
always existed between the congregations
of the two churches.
The Rev. George C. Eldredge. assistant
pastor of Calvary Presbyterian Church,
delivered a sermon on Thanksgiv
ing day and the reason which man has
for offering up thanks to his Creator. He
said that a man should compare himself
with other men, and should contrast his
condition to-day with what he was a year
ago, or even ten or twenty years ago, in
order that he may know his reason for
being thankful. Thanks, he asserted, that
have no memory of good for their incen
tive, spring merely from the lips and are
a mockery of God. He declared that we
are in debt to God beyond redemption, and
that we owe to him all that we are, all
that we have, and all that we may hope
to be. In describing the proper state of
irmd for the observation of Thanksgiving
day, he said that we should have no envy
nor contempt in our hearts and that we
should be ready to rejoice with the
wealthy and happy and to weep with the
poor and wretched.
NATIONAL FORBEARANCE.
Rev. Dr. E. A. Woods JTalks of the
Nation's Duties.
The Rev. Dr. E. A. "Woods preachdd the
sermon at a morning- service at the First
Baptist Church. He said in part:
The Psalms are full of thanksgiving. It
is an expression of gratitude for bless
ings received. Gratitude demands expres
sion. There are many sad hearts because of
gratitude unexpressed. God Is our father and
because of all his goodness to us thanksgiving
is> a Christian duty. There is nothing which
can fill the place of a true home. He who has
this has a large part of the joy of life, and
without this the whole world cannot make one
happy. While we thank God for -our home and
loved ones, let us remember the homeless, the
desolate and those in want.
We have special occasion for national thanks
giving at this time. The past few yearÃ have"
been the most momentous In our history save
the years of Lincoln's administration. There
has been war, and as a result territorial ex
pansion. Duty performed brought responsibil
ity. Porto Rico and the Philippines are ours.
Ten millions have been added to our popula
tion. It was a grand and daring movement
fraught with far-reachins: results. We now
find ourselves a world power, with a large
duty to perform with other and weaker na
tion's. With such a leaf of our national history
turned, President McKinlcy falls at the hand
of an assassin and our nation and the worM
mourn together. But our Government lives
and President Roosevelt deserves and will re
ceive the prayers and co-operation of all gooU
citizens in his earnest endeavor to carry out
the policy of his lamented predecessor. Vve are
a great nation and in dealing with other na
tions, whether strong or weak, it becomes us
to shew to the world that the golden ruls
should sovern the greatest nations as It does
the notlest individuals. May no boasted
strength ever induce us to drive a hard bar
gain with another nation weaker than our-
We beast of our freedom of speech and it is
our Kloiy, but respect for laws and for rulers
must rot be sacrificed. There is no room in
this country for anarchists. TVe welcome im
migrarts who wish to become Americans, but

crowd out our laborers, who bring with them
their baibarlsm-as to fcuch immigration we de

and for such as would become Americans.
WORSHIP IN SYNAGOGUE.
lour Congregations Listen to Splen
did Music and a Sermon.
The music rendered by the church
choir and soloists at the Geary-street
synagogue yesterday more than repaid
the congregations of the various four
temples that assembled there.
The music was under the direction of
Cantor Rabinowitz of "the synagogue in
which the services were held. Tfce "Ma
Tova," by the Cantor and the choir,
which opened the services, was beauti
fully rendered, and the opening prayer
of Rabbi Nieto caused each member of
the vast congregation to feel the solemni
ty of the occasion. Rabbi Nieto's prayer
was followed by the hymn, "Praise the
Lord," sung by the choir, with D.
Manlloyd as soloist. Rabbi Levy's read
ing of the Scriptures followed the hymn
of praise.
time. Abbie Carrington sang "I Will
Extol Thee. " Miss Lilly Roeder rendered
the hymn, "Heavenly Father."
Rabbi Voorsanger delivered the Thanks
giving sermon and his words, though not
many, were heartfelt. He told of the is
sue of the first proclamation, declaring
the last Thursday of November a day of
thanksgiving, and of the reasons George
Washington gave for its issuance. He
said that this, "the most God blessed of
all countries," had every reason to be
thankful, and he brought the day home
to the congregation by telling of how by
the simple words of the constitution of
the United States "all men are free and
equal." the Jews lost their identity as
Israelites and became identified as part
and parcel of this great and glorious
land.
The services closed with the singing of
the national anthem by a number of
children in the choir.
THANKFUL FOR LIBERTIES.
Rev. William Rader Preaches at the
Third Congregational Church.
The pulpit of the Third Congregational
Church was decorated with flags and fes
toons of evergreen for the service at 11
o'clock. Special music was rendered by
an augmented choir. The pastor, the
Rev. William Rader, preached the ser
mon.
In speaking of our national affairs and
of political conditions Dr. Rader said that
our country is prosperous and that the
American people are enjoying liberties
unknown to people of other parts of the
world. He said our dominion has been
expanded and that- through its expansion
the blessings of liberty had been carried
to people in another continent. He spoke
of the outcome of the recent election in
New York, and took occasion to express
his thankfulness for the victory which he
declared had been won for good govern
ment and righteousness. He saw reason
for being thankful in the end of the
strike which recently caused such bitter
enmity in this city. He said that the
strike had been like a thunder cloud in
the air, and that when it finally cleared
away it left peace and calmness in its
wake, enabling capitalists and laborers
to abide together in peace.
SERVICES AT THE CATHEDRAL
Requiem Masses Celebrated for De
ceased Members of Societies.
Yesterday's services at St. Mary's
Cathedral consisted of two requiem
masses, for deceased members of the
Catholic Ladies' Aid Society and of the
Young Men's Catholic Union. The for
mer was a simple musical mass, cele
brated by Father Hannigan. The latter
was celebrated by Father Byrne, who is
chaplain of the union. Father Hannigan
acted as deacon and Father Dempsey as
subdeacon. Father Prendergast was
master of ceremonies. Father Ryan de
livered an impressive sermon consolatory
to relatives and friends of the young
men of the society who have passed away
since its organization.
Both services were largely attended by
members of the parish. The Archbishop
and many clergymen from the city and
it 3 vicinity were present, but took no
active part in the day's ceremonies. .
THIRTEEN CHURCHES UNITE.
Tiethodist Episcopal Congregations
Worship in Union Service.
All the Methodist Episcopal churches of
San Francisco, thirteen in number, held
a union service at the Howard-street
Church at 11 o'clock. The choir of that
church, under the direction of Miss Flora
Bollinger, rendered Thanksgiving hymns
and anihems. Miss Tippett, a well known
church singer of Chicago, sang the of
fertory.
The sermon was preached by the Rev.
Hearts of Orphans
Cheered by Good
Dinners.
Soldiers Are Merry at
Creaking Tables
in Mess HalL
THE hearts of 700 little boys and
girls were made happy and their
stomachs Incidentally filled yes
terday at a Thanksgiving dinner
given to them in the Convent of
the Holy Family, 890 Hayes street. Three
large rooms were required to accommo
date the children, who came from the
Holy Family Day Home, 429 Sixth street;
St. Francis' Day Home, 1413 Powell street,
and Sacred Heart Day Home, 120 Hayes
street.
The Sisters of the Holy Family had
been busy for weeks preparing to enter
tain the young ones who are daily com
mitted to their kindly care. Donations of
many turkeys and all the accessories that
go to make up a regulation Thanksgiv
ing dinner had been made by friends of
the institutions. The dining rooms re
served for the young guests had been
beautifully decorated with ferns, flowers
and festoons of colored ribbons, and many
long tables were prettily adorned in a
similar fashion.
When the children were seated Most
Rev. Archbishop Riordan said grace and
fourteen hulWred busy little hands began
transferring the many good things to
seven hundred expectant little mouths.
Half a hundred or more turkeys, all
cooked to a turn, were dissected by Dr.
Pawlicki, Dr. Tillmann, Frank X. Ryan,
Richard Quinlan and C. Cunningham,
who acted as official carvers for the af
fair. A number of lady friends and ben
efactors of the homes constituted them
selves waitresses and saw to it that none
of the infant diners went hungry. Sev
eral members of the local Catholic clergy
were present and also assisted in passing
the viands to as happy a throng as ever
gathered at a banquet board.
An interesting feature was the table at
which were seated one hundred little
girls ranging from three to five years, all
in high chair 3. Kindergarten songs were
sung by the little tots before and after
the feast.
The following clergymen were present:
Vicar General Prendergast and Rev.
Fathers Hugh Lagan, M. D. Connolly.
Jerome Hannigan. Edward Dempsey,
Charles A. Ramm. Maurice Kenealy, Mc-
Nicoll, Moran and Giles.
Dr. Larkin. pastor of Grace Methodist
Episcopal Church.
CHURCH BENEFIT A SUCCESS.
St. Joseph's Parishioners Give a
Thanksgiving Entertainment.
A Thanksgiving day entertainment and
dance was given last night at Eintracht
Hall for the benefit of St. Joseph' 3
Church. The affair proved a great suc
cess. Before the time scheduled for tha
commencement of the programme the hall
was crowded to its utmost. Even stand
ing room could not be obtained in the gal
leries or on the main floor.
The entertainment for the most part
was the work of the children of the
parish. The little ones took part in the
programme and contributed greatly to the
success of the evening. Mrs. Dowling,
president of Branch No. W, C. L. A. S..
attended to the ice cream booth, and the
coffee and soda water booth was in charge
of Mrs. Miley, Mrs. O'Connor. Mrs. Denny.
Miss Denny. Miss Mannlon and Miss Mc-
Phillips. The money derived from the
entertainment will be devoted to defray
ing expenses of needed repairs on the
church.
THANKSGIVING AT PRESIDIO.
Elaborate Dinner Is Provided for the
Soldiers.
Thanksgiving was celebrated at the
Presidio by the absence of all drills and
unnecessary- calls and three hearty meals
on dainties which are strangers to the
regular bill of fare for the soldiers. The
organizations which are permanently gar
risoned on the reser% r ation had elaborate
menus, including all those delicacies ap
propriate for the occasion.
The recruits did not fare so well, al
though a much better dinner than usual
was provided for them. So many hun
dreds of them are coming in daily that
it is almost impossible to make accurate
calculations for feeding them, particular
ly when it comes to supplying something
besides the regular Government rations.
During the evening musical and other en
tertainments were held by several of the
batteries of artillery.
HOMES OF POOR GLADDENED.
Young Women's Christian Associa
tion Care for Many Families.
The members of the Young Women's
Christian Association. 1259 CFarrell
street, gave dinners to the deserving poor
that had previously been visited and re
ported as especially worthy. Through
the kindness of numerous friends and
many leading merchants who contributed
bountifully, the young women were en
abled to make happy more than a hun
dred poor families by the presentation
of materials for a dinner. To each fam
ily was carried a turkey or chicken, ham,

At the City Prison.
Through the thoughtfulness of Chief
Wittman the prisoners in the City Prison,
numbering about one hundred,, were
treated to a substantial Thanksgiving
dinner consisting of turkey, potatoes and
mince pie. Commissary Shaw purchased
tifteen turkeys ranging from twenty-eight
to twelve Bounds, and there was an
abundant supply for every one. The
prison attaches had an addition of plum
pudding, ice cream, nuts, raisins and
oranges. The chef Arthur McCumi
skey, cooked the viands in his best style.
The prisoners gave three cheers for the
Chief and commissary.
County Hospital Patients Feasted.
The 375 patients of the City and County
Hospital were treated to a dinner of tur
key, mince pie and an abundance of
fresh fruit. Commissary Maguire had
been squaring ends for the past six
months in order to make the patients feel
that they had not been forgotten by a
generous public and an economic board
of officials.
Maccabee Social Club.
The Maccabee Social Club, composed

ISSUE GENERAL
STRIKE ORDER
Switchmen Will Call Out
Thirty More Railroad
Crews.
Superintendent English at
Versailles Is Compelled to
Make Up Trains.
PITTSBURG. Pa.. Nov. 28.â A report
from McKeesport to-night says that at
a meeting of the switchmen a general
strike order was issued for that city. This
will call out ten crews on the Baltimore
and Ohio and twenty crews employed by
the tube works and Monongahela fur
naces.
It was said to-night that Superintendent
English at Versailles was compelled to
make up trains himself owing to the
strike. It is likely th*> McKeesport LodgÂ«
of the Brotherhood of Railroad Men will
follow the lead of the Pittsburg lodges
in ignoring the strike.
The striking switchmen held an
exciting meting to-night ar McKees
Rocks. There were over 300 strikers anrl
sympathizers present. At th<=> meeting 140
new members were initiated into the
Switchmen* Union. Of these IL4 were
members of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Men.
REFUSE TO GIVE
THEIR VERDICT
Hessman Inquest Jury
men Want Widow's
Testimony.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 28.â After deliberating
for nearly half an hour this morning tha
jurymen in the Otto Hessman suicide in
quest refused to decide upon a verdict
until they had heard Mrs. Clara T. Hess
man. widow of the deceased, testify or
had her deposition read.
She had been subpenaed to attend the in
vestigation Tuesday, but forwarded a med
ical certificate from San Francisco, in
which it was stated that she was suffer
ing from nervous prostration and would,
be unable to attend. Coroner H. B. Mehx
mann then continued the inquest until to
day, hoping that Mrs. Hessman, would be
well enough to appear and take the stand.
City Marshal John Conrad in the mean
time called upon Mrs. Hessman in San.
Francisco and he reported this morning;
to the Coroner that she was still indis
posed.
Coroner Mehrmann decided to proceed
with the inquest and take as much evi
dence as was available. Mrs. Mary Dick
son, sister of Mrs. Hessman, identified
Hessman' s body, which has been lyinaj
in the local morgue since last Sunday.
She also testified that the dead man was
given to hard drinking, and in her opin
ion was crazy. Asked by Coroner Mehr
mann when she had last seen Mr. Hess
man. Mrs. Dickson replied :
"I last saw him in a train last June be
fore I went to Mexico. He then stared at
me like a maniac."
Dr. C. L. Tisdale. one of the autopsy
physicians, gave testimony that was in
flat contradiction to that given by Mrs.
Dickson. He asserted that he had never
in his postmortem examinations found the
internal organs of a body in a better con
dition than were those of Hessman' s. The
brain als#, Â£he doctor declared, was that
of a sane man. not a lesion of any kind!
! having been discovered therein.
"In view of the fact," said Dr. Tis
dale. "that all the internal organs and
brain of Mr. Hessman were in a perfect
state and not such as would be found in
the body of a drunkard or an insane per
son, the statements made here that he was
a heavy drinker and crazy are astounding
to me."
Luke Doyle testified that he met Hess
man Saturday after the altercation with
Arthur Stenbiht. Hessman was smeared
with blood but was perfectly sober, the
witness said. Others who gave testimony
were E. E. Blake, Police Officer L. W.
Schroeder and Dr. A. A. Stafford.
As all the jurymen wanted to hear tes
timony from Mrs. Hessman and also from
Letter Carrier Frank Spink. who says he
saw Stenbiht jump upon Hessman and
kick him while down. Coroner Mehrmann
continued the inquest until next Tuesday
morning at 10 A. M. Spink could not tes
tify to-day, as he could not secure a re
lease from duty.
The jury in the inquest 13 composed of
F P. Furey, D. T. Hard. Chris Grau. W.
H. Walter. C. W. Pinkerton, Arthur Cro
zier and James Delvecchio.

CHINA EXPECTS
MORE TROUBLE
Arsenals Work Overtime
Turning Out Muni
tions of War.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET X
W.. WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.-Feverish
efforts are being made by China to equip
another army with which to resist for
eign aggression. Authoritative reports
have been received here showing that the
various arsenals of China are working
overtime to turn cut arms, field and
great guns and ammunition for the use
of Chinese troops. In addition, China is
importing large quantities of arms and
munitions of war, in spite of the provi
sion of the peace protocol by which she
bound herself to stop such importations.
Unrest still prevails throughout the em
pire and the authorities expect that time
will only accentuate it. The Yangtse
basin is especially in a ferment. The
provinces in this region had no part in
the Boxer uprising, yet under the decree
of the throne they are compelled to make
heavy contributions to the fund being
raised to meet the indemnity demand of
the powers. During the Boxer uprising
the friendly southern viceroys had great
difficulty in preventing the people under
their jurisdiction from joining in the anti
foreign movement. The conduct of the
powers has increased rather than dimin
ished the hatred of the Chinese for the
West, and it would not surprise the offi
cials herf- should another outbreak occur
within the next year.

Owing to the rain the managers of the

the players. The first public game will
take place on Sunday afternoon.

"DIE MEISTERSINGER" GIVEN
FOR A HOLIDAY ATTRACTION
Eames to Appear
To-Night in
"Aida."
SOCIETY did not celebrate its
Thanksgiving by turning out in
large numbers to attend the
grand opera last evening.
Wagner's "Die Meistersinger"
was repeated by the Grau Company, with
the same splendid cast that sang in the
composition last week and the perform
ance aroused even more enthusiasm than
when it was heard by a crowded house.
There were many vacant seats in the
Grand Opera-house last night, but the
general holiday undoubtedly kept many
persons away, owing to previous engage
ments.
Mme. Gadski was the recipient of many
floral tributes and was given many cur*
tain calls, together with the talented
singers who sang with her. Schumann-
Heink, Dippel, Bispham, Blass, Muhl
mann, Reiss, Dufriche and De
Reszke were in the cast and, with Con
ductor Damrosch, received many recalls
by the enthusiastic uudience.
Madame Eames has assured Manager
Grau that she will sing to-night in Ver
di's tragic opera, "Aida." Last night she
sent word to Grau that she was in
perfect health anl all trace of her cold
had disappeared.
Louise Homer is to sing as Amneris to
night, Scottiiis to appear as Amonasro,
Journet is cast for Ramfis and De March!
is to be Radames. The production of the
Verdi composition should attract a large
audience, as the opera is not only a fa
vorite one, but there is considerable de
sire to hear Madame Eames in it.
Madame Calve is to arrive this morning
from Los Angeles on the Owl train. She
is scheduled to sing in "Carmen" to-mor
row night.
Madame Sembrich will be the star at
traction at to-morrow's matinee, when
"II Barbiere di Siviglia" is to be re
pented.
"Lohengrin" is to be presented on Sun
day night at popular prices, with Gadski
in the cast.
The extra performances to be given
next week at popular prices will be as
follows:
Monday matinee, "Le Nozze di Figaro,"
with Eames, Sembrich, Scheff, Campanari and
De Reszke.
Monday night douhje bill, "La Boheme" and

latter composition.

GOSSIP ABOUT
BOSS ACTIVITY
Martin Kelly Is Making
a Big Splurge in
Politics.
Some Candidate for High
Favor May Be Putting
Up the Coin.
It is the talk of local politicians that
Boss Kelly intends to do business in the
next campaign on his own account. The
story goes that he was cheated by Her
rin. Lynch and Jere Burke in the recent
Republican municipal convention, and
that an accomplice in the cheating was
his own partner, Phil Crimmins. The
story may lack the elements of truth,
but the fact remains that Boss Kelly has
opened political headquarters and is mak
ing an effort to organize a club. It is
rumored that he intends to follow the ex
amples of the Union League and the
Republican Primary League and have
his club incorporated. His new rooms in
the Vendome are equipped with chairs,
desks, etc., for the accommodation" of
fifty or sixty persons. Workers from
several of the districts have been invited
to visit headquarters and inspect the
premises.
Some one in the background must be
furnishing the boss with money to make
the splurge. It may turn out that the
story of strained relations between Kelly
and Herrin is a mere blind and that the
political department of the Southern Pa
cific is contributing the coin to maintain
the new headquarters.
The new Republican County Commitee,
created by the convention which nomin
ated Asa R. W T ells for Mayor, will organ
ize about the first of January. Herrin's
choice for chairman of the committee is
ex-Assemblyman A. G. Fisk, whose legs
were pulled and twisted out of shape
during the closing hours of an inglorious
campaign. Boss Kelly's followers in the
committee seem to regard Fisk with
favor. The machine workers were confi
dent for a time that the primary election
law would be overthrown, but since The
Call sounded the alarm opinion in this
respect has changed. Lynch, Herrin,

"ONE VOICE IN A MILLION."
Calve Finds a Remarkable Little
Singer in the South.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28.â Emma Calve
left Los Angeles on the "Owl" train this
evening for San Francisco, where she
says she will sing Saturday night. With
the diva and her maid went little thir
teen-year-old Edna Darch of this city,
who the singer has taken under her pro
tection with the intention of developing
her voice. Mme. Calve said after hearing
the child sing that her voice was "one in
a million," and at once sought the con
sent to the girl's parents, who are in hum
ble circumstances, to take her to Paris,
where she says she will personally watch
over her musical education.
Mrs. Darch took Thanksgiving dinner
with Calve and the arrangement was com
pleted whereby Edna Darch goes to Paris
as a protege of the celebrated singer.
Calve Leaves Pasadena.
PASADENA, Nov. 28.â Madame Calve
left to-night on the Owl for San Fran
cisco. She has promised Manager Grau
to sing Saturday night. Calve had
plenned to leave here Friday, then
changed her plans and decided to remain
indefinitely. To-day she felt so improved
in health that she packed her baggage
and departed. She expressed herself as
having been greatly benefited by her stay
here.
Crimmins and Kelly fought vigorously
for control of the committee and took
special care to exclude from membership
every applicant who was supposed to be
friendly to A. Ruef. The activity was in
spired by the belief at that time that the
primary election law would be over
thrown'and the way made clear for the
committee to name the delegates to the
State convention of the Republican party.
Now the bosses begin to suspect that any
aspirant for office who joins in a scheme
to question the. law will sign his own
political death warrant, hence the pros
pects of the county committee appointing
the delegates are not regarded as allur
ing There is no doubt that all the bosses
will be lined up to support the Gage
.Herrin programme if the wrecked ma
chine can be put together and readjusted
for another run.
The latest thing in Southern California
politics is a new weekly paper called the
Los Angeles Democrat. The first num
ber gives some attention to affairs politi
cal in San Francisco. The Democrat s
opinion of our Mayor-elect Is thus ex
pressed: _, ,
"Mr Eugene E. Sehmitz, Mayor-elect
of San Francisco, talks too much with
his mouth. He is measuring his own im
portance with a. tongue that runs sixty
inches to the yard. He reminds one of a
small boy with his first pair of red top
boots. At all events Mr. Sehmitz is a
disappointment to his friends and a de
lightfully stupid politician to his political
opponents."
STOCKTON'S CHIEF OF
POLICE WILL RESIGN
John Gall to Quit Position and En
gage in Business in This
City.
John Gall, Chief of Police of Stockton,
has informed his friends that he intends
to resign his position in a few days and
return to his old home in this city. Mr.
Gall went from San Francisco to Stock
ton fifteen years ago, where for the last
ten years he has filled the responsible po
sition of head of the police department.
He is at present in this city making ar
rangements preparatory to engaging in
business.
During the ten years that Mr. Gall held
the office of Chief of Police he discharged
the duties of his position in the most able
and satisfactory manner. That the peo
ple of Stockton "are pleased with his ser
vices is well shown by his continuous re
election to office. Mr. Gall, in speaking
about his intended resignation, said last
night that he had determined to resign
}n order that he might return to this city
and embark in business for himself.
He said that although he was pleased
with his position at the head of the
Stockton police department, he wished to
return to his old friends in this city. He
said he preferred private business to the
small salary and uncertainty of a politi
cal position.
Gadski and Cast
in Splendid
Voice.
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
THE Wagnerites had it last night at
the Grand Opera-house, with a sec
ond capital performance of "Die
Me'stersinger." A slightly drowsy
house it was at the beginning of
things, full-fed and well content to be en
tertained without giving thanks unto their
entertainers. The house was small com
paratively, with after-dinner additions
drifting in until a late hour, but the box
population and swelldom generally were
thanksgiving elsewhere.
But when there was a warming up, the
singers to their work, the audience to its
hearing, there was one of the season's
greatest demonstrations, and again, as
last time, in the splendid quintet at the
third act's close. The singers received
call after call, and bowed recognition
without at all succeeding in satisfying the
audience that wanted the quintet re
peated. The plaudit 3of the faithful
lasted until the first notes of the fourth
act's opening, and then subsided unsatis
fied.
The singers were all in good form, and
repeated their successes of the first per
formance of the opera. Gadski, as Eva,
again shone luminously, singing with a
joyful freedom and sweetness that she
had never surpassed. De Reszke' s Hans
Sachs was a freer performance than his
first interpretation, and full of noble
breadth and stately humor. His song of
interruption to the Beckmesser serenade
was given with a massive jollity and vo
cal fullness that got every inch of possi
bility out of the scene, and he is no less
admirable in tenderer mood. Bispham' s
Beckmesser is a classic, full of the sour
crabbidness of the creatureâ its spiteful
smallness and tedious spirit, and last
night he did the most that could be done
with the character. No one could do more.
Mr. Dippel as Walter, Wagner's modest
reincarnation of himself, did exactly as
he did at the other performance, neither
very great things, nor yet small ones.
He 'pleased, and was in fresh, bright
voice. Mr. Blass was an excellent Pog
ner, delivering the famous "address"
with right noble accent. Mr. Muhlmann
did all that .was necessary as Kothner,
and Mr. Reiss got a round of applause
all to himself as the apprentice David.
He deserved it for a bit of excellent act
ing and a free, fresh voice of fine quality,
admirably used. Damrosch, as usual, led
the orchestra to distinction.
POLICE SEARCH
FOR JOHN KENNY
Want Him to Clear Up a
Mystery Surrounding
a Death.
Draws His Pay and Suddenly
Leaves Employment in
Oakland.
The death of John Fitzgerald In the
City and County Hospital yesterday
morning furnished another phase of a
mystery the detectives are trying to solve.
He was found early last Sunday morn
ing by Patrolman J. C. Laws lying on a
pile of junk and bleeding from a wound
on the head. The injured man was taken
to the Central Emergency Hospital, where
his wounds were dressed- He was then
conveyed to the City and County Hospi
tal.
As soon as he recovered consciousness
he said he had been around town with a
friend drinking and that he received his
Injuries by falling on a pile of scrap iron
and broken glass.
Dr. Boscowitz, acting autopsy surgeon
at the Morgue, made a post-mortem ex
amination yesterday and found that death
had been caused by a fracture of the skull
on the right side. The fracture was about
an inch long and had been made with a
pointed instrument driven into the skull
with considerable violence. The left knee
and left forearm were bruised and
scratched and there was what looked like
a knife stab on the abdomen. The wound
penetrated the muscles and the membrane
of the intestines, but did not injure them.
The fracture of the skull was the cause
of death.
When Captain Seymour received the re
port Monday morning of Policeman Laws,
who found Fitzgerald Sunday morning in
the alleyway at 362 Second street, to the
effect that Fitzgerald had a fractured
skull, he detailed Detectives Dlnan and
Wren on the case. They went to the hos
pital and saw Fitzgerald. His statement
to them was that he was employed by
Tobin & Co., contractors, Oakland, and
after getting his pay Saturday night he
came to the city with John Kenny, who
worked with him. They went around town
drinking considerably and the last he re
membered was being in the vacant lot on
Second street and falling among a lot of
broken glass and scrap iron. He was cer
tain that no one cut him.
Dinan and Wren went to Oakland and
called upon Tobin & Co. They were told
that Kenny had got his pay early Monday
morning and had left. He was a man
about 50 years of age. c feet tall and of
ruddy complexion. They did not know
where he could be found.
Captain Seymour says that nothing can
be done in the rr>"tter in veiw of Fitzger
ald's statement that no one cut him. An
effort will, however, be made to find
Kenny to see if he can throw any light
on the subject. If Fitzgerald had been
stabbed by some one, robbery could not
have been the motive, as he had $23 in
his pockets when found Sunday morning.
GROCER CLARK TRICKED
BY CONFIDENCE MAN
The two young men who have been
playing a successful trick upon saloon
keepers and storekeepers have been heard
from again. Michael Clark, grocer,
Twelfth and Howard streets, reported to
the police yesterday that a young man
entered his barroom shortly after the
noon hour Wednesday and ordered a glass
of beer. After drinking the beer he asked
Clark what kind of flour he kept, as he
was looking for a particular brand.
Clark took him into the store and
showed him the flour he had In stock.
The young man kept talking to him on
different subjects for some time and left
without purchasing any flour. When
Clark returned to the barroom he discov
ered that the till had been rifled of its
contents, about $10. while he was in the
store, by a supposed confederate of the
young man who was so anxious about the
brand of flour. Clark describes him as
about 25 years of age, smooth shaven and
well dressed in a dark gray suit.

Fell on His Own Knife.
Norman Potts, aged 16 years, residing
at 653 Folsom street, was treated at the

place. Potts fell and the blade of a pen
knife he held in hia hand penetrated his
