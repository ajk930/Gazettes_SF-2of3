"When some of the officers of the Phae
ton were going over the field of action
next day and the Government patrols
were carrying away the dead to the fune
ral trenches and the wounded to the pris
ons, already filled with the unfortunates,
the naval officers saw many sights that
proclaimed' that the field had been 'one
on which a bloody affray had taken place.
The first sight that caught their eyes as
they drove along a roadway across the
plain was a blood-covered stretcher lying
where, it had been tossed into the ditch
by the roadside. A little further along
the road they overtook a carriage which
bore a wounded man, evidently an officer,
and Bitting beside him were other officers
of the Government forces supporting hini,
while behind the carriage in which the
groaning officer was stretched came a
disorderly looking lot of soldiers*.
There were few engagements between
Government and rebel forces while the
Phaeton lay off Panama, but one of these
that did occur was a most sanguinary af
fair. It took place after nightfall on the
field just without the city, and although
none of the ship's company of the war
ship saw the action the sounds of the fir
ing proved that a stirring action was tak
ing place, and next morning when the
patrols were marching over the, field from
which the rebels had fled the many
wounded left groaning In pain and the
dead lying here and there on ,the grass
and amidst the shrubbery showed that a
fierce fight had taken place.

state that Panama, while not in an

for the rebel force3 were in the field Just
beyond the city and there were barricades
on the streets, and on the bridge under

The report states that on the passage

ten miles by the British cable steamer
Britannia, which is being used to mark
out a track for the cable. About a hun
dred miles from the coast an obstruction
Â¦was met in the shape of a range of sub
marine mountains lying directly in the
track, and a deviation to the south had to
be made in order to clear it. The greatest
depth obtained was 2S00 fathoms, and the

the depth recorded -when the ship was
right above the tops of the mountains. It
has been decided to land the cable at

"I obtained these facts from a man
high in office in the -East," said Mr.
Hickey, "who was present at the con
ference, and I afterward confirmed the
statements 'from members of the exec
utive board. Judge Gary, former presi
dent of the Federal Steel Company, was
present at the conference, and x he is
now a high official- of the United States
Steer Corporation. He, I am informed,
'was in -favor of signing the scale for all
the -.mills in the combine, but this did
not meet the approval of Mr. Schwab,
who thought it too radical a move. -Mr.
Morgan then offered Shaffer four addi

sign the â¢ scale as an experiment,- and
then he told Mr. Shaffer that if the or

and lived up to the agreement he would
: pledge his word 'that In two years every
mill. in the combine would be included in
the contract; with the 'Amalgamated As
sociation. : , .
Hickey reported that 72 per cent of the
mills were now working and that in his
opinion the strike was practically lost.
Hickey opened his remarks with a re
view ef the conferences with the repre
sentatives of the United States Corpora
tion preceding the strike, in which he de
clared that. Messrs. Morgan and Schwab
outlined their policy toward organized'
labor. Hickey went into these details
to show that Secretary Tighe and Presi
dent Shaffer had misrepresented the facts
when they appealed to the members of
the association' to 'strike* on' the ground
that the steel corporation was .determined
to crush organized labor and ruin the
Amalgamated Association. He main
tained'that the. proposition- offered by
Morgan had fceen r falr.
Hickey Denounces Shaffer.
"The object of the meeting," said Presi
dent Redfern, "was not to vote upon the
question of returning to work, but to
listen to the report of Messrs. Hickey and
Cooper, who have been fn the East to see
what Is the real situation. The strike has
now -been : on here for two' weeks, and
during that time "the members of the
lodge here have heard absolutely nothing
about the! real situation from the national
officers. All that we have known we have
seen in the papers, and last week a num
ber of the members had a meeting and
decided to send Cooper and Hickey back
East to find out these " things". Their re
port was absolutely satisfactory and was
well received, but I have no idea what the
action of the lodge will be or whether
there will be any action taken."
Â¦Hickey had little to' say of the confer
ence in Pittsburg with President. Shaffer
and other national officers. The address
was mainly of a personal nature, in which
President Shaffer was charged with hav
ing violated the constitution in ordering
the strike. Many other matters dealing
with the history of the association came
up for discussion. Â¦
Â¦~ Nearly all the members of the lodge
were present when the meeting was called
to- order: President Joseph Redfern of
the local lodge presided. After the meet

the national officers of the Amalgamated
Association had misrepresented the atti
tude of the United States Steel Corpora
tion toward organized labor in order to
get the members of- the association out on
strike were made by former Vice Presi
dent J. D. Hickey at the meeting of the
Bay View Lodge, to-night. Mr. Hickey
gave the members the result of his trip
to Pittsburg, whither he went to investi
gate the situation in regard. to the steel
strike. He said the strike appeared to be
lost and it may take years to repair the
damage already done to the association.
Hickey made no recommendation to the
lodge as to Its future action, but it Is be
lieved his speech may cause a change in
sentiment, not -only in Bay View, but in

BERLIN. Sept. Lâ It is riow_very doubt
ful, according: -to a dispatch to the Lokal
Anxelger from Basle. Switzerland,
whether Prince Chun wiil come to Berlin
to make formal apology for the murder
of Baron Kettler. Members of the ex
piatory mission say: Â»
"Under present conditions we can never
go to Berlin. We would rather die than
accept them."
It appears that they object particularly
to Prince Chun's attendants prostrating
themselves before Emperor "William, in
asmuch as this is a special honor reserved
for the Emperor of China, and would in
volve a recognition of the Kaiser's equal
ity.
The following- information Is given re
garding Prince Chun's speech to the
Kaiser. Prince Chun intended to say:
"The Chinese Government regrets that
Baron von Ketteler was killed;" but the
German Government dictated the follow
ing form: "The Chinese Government begs
pardon for the murder of the German
Minister. Baron von Ketteler." ' Â¦
The Chinese in Basle are trying to give
the case international prominence by em
phasizing the fact that one ot the digni
taries selected for prostration .was made a
baronet by Queen Victoria, while another
has the criss of the Legion -of Honor.
It is alleged that Emperor William is
determined that the protocol shall be
signed before he receives Prince Chun
and that he will insist upon an apology
for the murder of Baron von Ketteler.
Beyond that, however, the ceremony of
reception will be deprived of everything
cf a humillatlnsr character, full honors
being awarded to Prince Chun, as a
brother of Emperor Kwang Su, on his
way to the palace.
LONDON, Sept. 2â "The delay in the
promulgation of the edicts necessary to
complete the protocol is due to the Chun
difficulty," says a dispatch to the Times
from Peking. "The Chinese version Is
tlxat Emperor- William insisted upon
Prince Chun kotowing-, and when this was
refused wanted his suite to kotow. For
a century past all envoys of Peking have
refused to i>erf orm this barbaric cere
mony and there Is great - astonishment
here that Germany has raised the ques
tion, as the German Minister Is so anxi
ous to get the protocol signed that he has
to-day, for the second - time, ' urged the
Ministers not to wait for the edict, but to
get the protocol signed and to trust the

Every man should strive to do justice to him
self, but in doing 60 he should not forget the
rights of his neighbor. He should be sure that
he U in the right, and then stand squarely in
the path. If there is any moving to be done,
let the other fellow do it. This applies to na
tions as well as to individuals.
We have all seen Ihe type of man who is spo
ken of as his own worst enemy. I have no pa
tience with him. Often he is a worse enemy
to others. A manly man â and that is whit we
all ought 'to beâ must have strength and power
and perseverance. It is the trials of life that
test the stuff a man or woman is made of.
and the one who is strong, fearless and coura

On this question of our duty to our neigh

to being Imposed upon, but before you act al
ways stop to consider the rights of others be
fore standing up for your own. The only true
vay to help a man is to aid him in helping nlm.
self. All of us stumble many times during a
lifetime and the fluty. of man to his neighbor
Is to help him to his feet that he may help him
self. You can help a man successfully, but 1
you can't carry him successfully. If you rob
a man of his self-respect, take away his sturdy,
relf-reliant manhood, no good you can : do will

however, and was not prepared to-dis

he could not participate in other races,

Explosion on Naphtha launch Brings
- Sad Ending to a Family
Outing. -
ALBANY, N. Y., Sept 1.â A frightful
fate befell the family of "Wilbur Alex
ander, a contractor of this city, to-night.
A naphtha launch exploded on the Hud
son Elver at the Abbey, a mile and a half
below this city, killing Mrs. Alexander
and her little daughter and burning Wil
bur Alexander and his son, Wilbur Jr., in
a horrible manner. ' â¢
The accident was the termination of a
day's outing on the river. Mr. Alex
ander took his wife, son and daughter for
a trio south from this city. On the Jour
ney home Mr. Alexander was taken sick..
He- ran the launch into a side cut near the
Abbey. . a.
The launch was tied near the shore.
The son, 12 year old, went to give his
father some medicine. The boy carried a
lantern and as he passed the tank con
taining the naphtha an explosion oc
curred, scattering the blazing fluid in
every direction and setting fire to the
launch. iMrs. Alexander, and her daugh
ter were .near the tank and their bodies
were completely covered by the burning
oil. The son jumped into the water when
the explosion took place.
Mr Alexander rushed to the assistance
of his wife and daughter, but they were
burned to death before his eyes. He was
at length compelled to jump into the river
to save himself. The bodies of the wife
and daughter -were chaired to a crip and
the launch was entirely consumed. It is
believed Mr. Alexander will die. The boy
will recover. Â¦

of surrenders and captures in all the
disaffected districts. Later accounts of
the recent engagement in Balangas' prov
ince between Captain H f C. Hale, with a
detachment of the Twentieth Infantry,
and the insurgent leader Gonzales, show
that it was more Important than it Â¦was
at first considered. Many deserters and
renegades were seen and heard giving
commands in English.
It Is in the plans of the military author
ities as a first step toward â¢ reducing the
force, to make two departments instead
of four, which would result in a consider
able saving. The headquarters of one de
partment would be Manila and of the
other Iloilo.
' MANILA, 'Sept. l.-Â£Every thing points to
the early capture or surrender of Miguel
Malvar, the Insurgent leader. When either
event occurs, everything will be favorable
to the establishment of permanent peace.
There is no conclusive evidence that the
man whom the posse wassafter last_ night
near Strasburg and Pleasant Hill* was
Francis. The only persons who saw him
were some section employes, and to-day
they told Deputy Sheriff Temple of John
son County that they saw a man running
.from the railroad tracks to the woods,
but x could not tell whether he was a
negro or a white man. A negro was taken
off a freight train at Harrisonvllle late
last night, but he was not the man
wanted.
Sheriff Koch, at "Warrensburg to-day,
was notified that a negro was arrested
early this morning in Clinton, Mo., and a
photograph of the prisoner will be sent to
the Sheriff for identification.
No effort was made to find Francis in
Johnson County to-day. He is believed
to be in Cass or Henry County, and a few
armed men are searching for him in those
counties.
Posses left Pleasant Hill and Lees Sum
mit this afternoon to prosecute the bunt
between those towns, as they had heard
that a negro answering the description of
Francis had been seen in that neighbor
hood to-day. Every rumor is being in
vestigated, but as all clews thus far have
led to false trails, new reports do not
inspire much confidence. *
Information against Charles and Frank
Brisco and Emmett Davenport, charging
them with being accessories after the
fact in the murder of Miss Henderson,
have been filed at Warrensburg. Their
preliminary hearing will be held on
Wednesday at Warrensburg.

The knife had been repeatedly plunged

was found downstairs, and this handle
had the name "Simms" on it. The cash
box, which was in the keeping of Scott,
cannot be found. The box contained
about $150.
Simms says he believes that burglars
entered the house, and, after searching

TACOMA, "Wash., Sept. Lâ Three thou
sand weavers and other workmen in shin
gle mills will be thrown out of employ
ment for an indefinite period by a decision
of the Shingle Manufacturers' Association
reached last night to close their mills
this week. A secret meeting was held in
order that the action taken might be car
ried into effect before it became known
to the Eastern shingle dealers who have
been endeavoring to secure control over
the production and consequent low prices.
During the spring and early summer
the shingle mills were busier than ever
before. Orders came pouring in and
shingles were going East by hundreds of
carloads. This movement was suddenly
checked by the falling off of orders caused
by the drought and partial crops falling in
Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska,
all of these States being heavy shingle
users. i

were the only outside organizations that
sent representatives to the meeting, al->
though all the labor unions in Chicago
had received invitations. The meeting
lasted .for several hours, and President
Shaffer came in for criticism by a num
ber, of the speakers. The arguments of
the non-strikers centered . about their
contract, with the Illinois Steel Com
pany â its sacredness and inviolability.
No provision has been made for the

President Simon Burns, whose reputed

New York. He remained absolutely non

the present serious predicament of the
Amalgamated Association will ultimate
ly be found. Most of the mills in Pitts
burg were deserted during the day.
Nothing was attempted in the way of
picket duty about the Painter Mills dur
ing the day. The strikers spent a por

PITTSBURG. Sept. 1.â The principal
interest in strike matters to-day was
centered in the Duquesne plant, where
It was expected the strikers would make
a decided, move toward closing the en
tire works. The report from there to
night says the situation is critical. The
two, boss melters and all of the shapers
went to work as usual this morning,
and twelve furnaces were changed. Only
one second helper went, in, and all the
ladlemeri stayed out. The strikers made
a thorough house-to-hq'use , canvass of
open-hearth men all day. At 4 o'clock,
the time for helpers and ladlemen to go
on, pickets were on duty on the streets
and turned back . three ladlemen. The
night turn is badly crippled, but men
were brought from the Bessemer depart
ment to help out, and the mill is run
ning full. Sixty of the day-turn men
were off, and the strikers say not a man
will report to-morrow.
If the open hearth be shut down the
forty-inch mill must also shut . down.
This mill supplies Monessen, Vander
grift and the tin mills, hence the move
ment is important to the strikers.
Mill officials admit to-day that a strike
is /on, but say that no" serious ; results
will follow. Thirty coal and iron po
lice were brought from Braddock, and
the night and day borough police are on
duty. Everything so ! far j has been con
ducted in a Quiet manner.
A conservative estimate places the
amount of the strike benefits that are
to be paid by the Amalgamated Associa
tion to its members, now idle, at $40,000
every week. This bases the number of
beneficiaries at 10,000 and the average
payment' of a member at $4. a week. J

The trip was a most dangerous one, but
was accomplished without accident. On
the way down both the Danube and the
Hating saw a great deal of ice. There
were some bergs, as Captain McLeod de

Bragg, Cal. The translation of the Latin
palindrome, , "Roma tibl subito, motibus
amor," is, "Rome, upon thee suddenly,
love with its commotion shall/come." This
is a specimen of the palindrome or stadoic
verse, a trfllng composition which reads
the same beginning from either , end of

Aldhelm. ' ; :
It is stated that since the Supreme Court of Mis
souri has declared unconstitutional the law imposing
a tax upon mortgages the rate of interest on real es
tate loans has fallen from 8 percent to 5 per cent. It
will be seen that while the law stood the borrower
had to pay the tax in the form of interest and some
thing over besides.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Very little profit then will Sampson .and Schley
obtain from the controversy while they yet live, and
nothing at all after they are dead. The great majority
of the American people honor both the pld heroes
for their long years of service in the cause of the re
public and v watch with regret the progress of the
strife fictween them. For the foolish partisans who
stirred it up the public has nothing but the contempt
which is ever visited upon strife-makers and tale-
Alas for the vanity of human wishes. The two old
men will get out of this strife nothing but bitter feel
ings, for their future fame will show but slightly in
American history. As the years roll on and the an
nals of our country, already crowded with illustrious
names, become more crowded still, the space which
even the most voluminous historian can afford for an
account of the battle of Santiago will grow smaller
and smaller, until it will almost vanish, and there will
be neither space nor inclination for appraising the
comparative merits or demerits of the commander of
the fleet who was absent from the fight and of his
second in command who actually conducted it to
success. . v
The foolish partisans who by their prejudices and
passions have forced on this controversy between the
two old heroes have doubtless believed they were
serving the cause of their favorite. Probably Maclay
deemed he was giving honor and satisfaction to his
hero, Sampson, when he declared Schley to have been
a coward at Santiago; and it is equally probable
Schley's friends and supporters thought they were
acting in behalf of his future fame and his present
gratification when they urged him to demand an in
vestigation, and began to assail Sampson and to hold
him up to ridicule as a tea-party idler â a dangler at
the apron strings of silly women. . .
REPORTS of the failing health of Rear Ad
miral Sampson, taken in connection with the
struggle now going on between his partisans
and those. of Schley, afford another illustration of the
folly and the vanity oi human strife. Schley's career
in the navy is about over, for he is to retire in Octo
ber, .while, according to the reports, Sampson is an
utterly .broken man, physically unable to appear be
fore the court to give testimony. What reward can
any outcome of the controversy" offer to either of
these old men sufficient to compensate them for the
vexation and ill feeling engendered to fret and em
bitter their declining years?
THE VANITY OF STRIFE.
Ethelbert Stewart, secretary of the Economical
Food Bureau of Chicago, is reported to have said
recently: "The poor are facing a crisis which may
alter their mode of life and force them to adopt sub
stitutes for such vegetables as cabbage and beans."
That is certainly a hard outlook for Chicago, but
what is to prevent the people from coming to Cali
fornia and living on peaches, and cream?
It is believed the Department of Agriculture might
accomplish something by publishing the names of
manufacturers whose goods are found to be adulter
ated. In that way the public would be at least put
on guard against certain brands of goods, and
thereby enabled to avoid them. As it is there is
comparatively little benefit gained by the exhibit at
Buffalo. The display is a warning to the people that
dangerous adulterations are in use, but it does not
afford any man a means of easily identifying which
are dangerous. when they are offered to him in the
market. The Government has authority to expose
and to punish a counterfeiter of money; why should
it not have power to expose^ the counterfeiter of
foods? -?â¢'Â¦;
With the sensation caused by the display there has
come a renewed demand for an effective law to pro
tect the public against the frauds, and probably some
thing in that direction will be attempted by legisla
tion at the coming session of Congress.. There are
of course many difficulties in the way of devising
adequate laws on the subject and having them en
forced strictly and impartially. The people of the
country naturally revolt at the thought of placing
industry and commerce under the control of a po
lice censorship, and yet if the evil augment in the
future as rapidly as it has in the past quarter of a
century it would seem that something will have to
be done to protect the producer of honest goods from
the ruinous competition of fraudulent manufacturers,
and the public from the effects of the untrammeled
sale of deleterious substances masquerading in the
form of foods.
OF all the exhibits made at the Buffalo expo
sition it is said none attracts more attention
from thoughtful visitors than the display
made by the Agricultural Department of pure and of
adulterated food products. The exhibit reveals to the
public the extent to which the evil of food adultera
tion and sophistication has gone, by showing speci
mens of dyes, impurities, 'chemical preservatives and
even poisons which arc offered for sale in alimentary
articles purchased in the open markets of the country.
FOOD COUNTERFEITS.
According to recently compiled statistics the aver
age length of life in this country in 1880 was but little
over 33 years, but in 1000 it was more than 35 years,
so perhaps by the end of the century the average
man will live long enough to make it worth while
being born.
Conditions in California remain as before. Our
farm and orchard products are still enjoying an un
precedented demand, and prices for almost everything
that the farmer and fruit-grower produce, except grain
and hay, are higher than the normal and tending still
higher. Were it not for the strike in this city and
around the bay. the State would be enjoying a pro
nounced productive boom. Even as it is we are do
ing a very large business.
The above showing is flattering. It exhibits a fine
condition of business all over the country. Evidently
the wave of prosperity which followed the election of
McKinley five years sgo, and which the '.Republican
party promised the voters of the country, has not yet
spent its force. It has lasted longer than the most
sanguine ones expected. The promise of the Repub
lican party has been more than kept Never before
has &Â£. -United States done such an immense busi
ness, both domestic and foreign, nor for such a long
time.
Cereali and iron were the only halting lines during
the week. Large available supplies and good crop
prospects, with indications of a decrease in the ex
ports, softened the wheat market slightly, though
foreign shipments from Atlantic ports were still very
large, amounting to 6,307,000 bushels, against
2,804,000 for the same week last year. Corn also open
ed the week with some depression, but stiffened
toward the close, with the stalwart bulls again in the
Chicago market as buyers. The iron and steel trades
were, oi course, more or less affected by the strike,
though it is estimated that not more than 20 per cent
of the country's capacity has thus far been affected,
and the indications are that even this is being gradu
ally decreased. The railroads report a gain in earn
ings in August of 12.1 per cent over August, 1900, and
this in the face of a scarcity of freight cars, which has
kept back a good deal of tonnage which otherwise
would have swelled this increase.
But there is no complication in the domestic busi
ness of the country, mid it Js here where the current
improvement lies. From air sources last week com
mercial reports pointed to a marked increase in the
volume of business. Chicago reported very heavy
purchasing of general stores, dry goods and clothing;
Omaha a larger August business than in 1900; Kan
sas City, which is one of the leading distributing
points to the great area lately parched by the heated
term, all the jobbing business that its merchants can
handle; and St. Louis an unusual demand among job
bers and an August diy goods trade beyond expecta
tions. All Western markets report a large call for
hardware, and the East reports. increasing shipments
of boots and shoes, & marked improvement in the
demand for cotton goods and the woolen mills crowd
ed with orders, even the small concerns having all
they can attend to. In the Middle West there is a
very active hide market, with a tendency toward
higher prices. Thus it will be seen that all over
the country there is ?. pronounced expansion: in the
jobbing trade. The bank clearings affirm this in a
gain for the week of 54.1 per cent,. every important
city in the country _Â¦; showing "an 'rincrease over last
year except Milwaukee, the loss in that cjty^ivas
merely nominal, being .6. per cent. 'The failures were
202, against 175 for the same week last year. Â¦ -
JUDGING from the condition of trade last week,
the country is entering upon another business
expansion. It may be the beginning of another
commercial boom, though this is hardly probable, as
the Outgoing Atlantic steamers report less call for
freight room, and some have lately sailed with par
tial cargoes, which would indicate a falling off in the
country's export trade. In contradiction to this,
however, ocean freights on the other coast have lately
hardened sufficiently to check a budding advance in
wheat. So the situation in regard to the foreign
trade of the country seems a little complicated.
IS IT ANOTHER EXPANSION?

The steam trial of the new Russian torpedo-boat ship
Jenissei has proved unsatisfactory. The average measured
mile speed was only 16.64 knots, and the horsepower fell short
500 on the contract for 4700 horsepower. The failure is laid
to the alleged poor quality of coal.
The new shipbuilding programme of the British navy em
braces three battleships of 16,500 tons each and 1S& knots speed,
to cost $6,500,000 and to be completed in 1904. They have been

armored cruisers of 10,000 tons and 23 knots speed, to -cost

PERSONAL MENTION.
The "United - States naval coaling station in Japan is at
Nagasaki, and is one of several parcels of land ceded to the
principal naval powers in 1866. No actual title is vested, but
a "permanent lease" is given at nominal yearly rental amount
ing to $60 for the two parcels occupied by the United States.
As our navy had no use for the site it was turned- over to the
Pacific Mall Company and was occupied by the latter until the
close of the late Spanish-American war, when the Navy De
partment again took possession, and construction of store
houses for 18,000 tons of coal is being proceeded with.
A naval expert, Arnold 'White, writes in the London Chron
icle about the necessity for fast and efficient cruisers, and pro
tests against continuing in service a fleet of 113 vessels more
or less obsolete and valueless. Few coast defenders are in
cluded as worthless, namely:' Glatton, Gorgon, Hecate, Cyclops,
Magdala/ Abyssinia. Wivern, Rupert, Hotspur and Orion. Â¦ All
four of the torpedo-boats of the Hazard class are useless; six
sloops, two gunboats, two second-class gunboats, thirty-four
torpedo gunboats, and all of the Goldfinch and Partridge gun
boat class are claimed to be useless. The writer does not exag
gerate the bad condition of the navy, but rather underrates; for
there are a number of cruisers built prior to 1890 which during
recent naval maneuvers have demonstrated /their inability to
maintain a decent sea speed and otherwise proved their ln
eiMciency
: Some quick work was recently done on board the British
cruiser Hermione. at Hongkong. The incident is told in the
Naval and Military Record, relating that the Hermlone re
ceived orders at 10 o'clock in the evening to have steam up
for full speed by 6 o'clock the following morning. Two of the
bciler3 were empty and open; the fire bars were out of four
of the furnaces; one boiler was in use for auxiliary purposes;
five boilers were completely full of water; no fires were laid;
the main condensers were empty and the important portions of
the gear were In the yard-shop for repairs. By a quarter past
10 the full steaming watch for eight boilers had mustered be
low, the missing gear was brought from the shop and fitted,
and by midnight the center fires were lighted in all the boilers.
At 5:15 a. m. the engines were moved with steam from all
eight boilers, and thirty-five minutes later the ship was un
der way. An hour later she was making about 16% knots,
and she covered 448 miles in twenty-five hours. The Her
mione's boilers are of the Scotch type, or box-boilers, so called.
In Addition to These â¢ Powerful Naval Engines of War, There Will Be Constructed Six
Armored Cruisers of Ten Thousand Tons Each and Ten Improved Destroyers.
One satisfactory feature of the situation is that Lip
ton, the owner of the challenger, is a true sportsman
and has conducted the whole affair from first to last
in a manner that has won the favor of the American
people. If we are to be beaten it will be pleasing to
know that the man who succeeded is one to whom
we can yield without. ill feeling. Still, it is always
better to defeat a good opponent than to surrender
to him. and it is to be hoped the defending yacht will
make in the races a much' better showing than she
has ever made in her trials. ' ''.
The famous trophy, which has now become the
greatest sporting prize in ,the world; was won by the
America in 1851. It has been in our possession for
fifty years without intermission. Never once has a
challenger succeeded in winning it away. Possibly a
greater interest might be given to the contest if we
should lose it, but we do not like to .have the interest
augmented in- that way. The struggle is exciting
enough as it is. ;
The uncertainty of the situation gives new interest
to the contention of T. W. Lawson that the New
England yacht, Independence, should have a" chance
to enter the contest. He says':' "There is really no
reason why the Independence should not be entered
as a competitor in the cup races. It is an interna
tional, not a yacht club, race. Anybody having a
yacht coming up to the requirements should be al
lowed to enter it. It should; make no difference
whether the boat hailed from Boston or San Fran
cisco."
It appears from the trials that while Shamrock II
is decidedly a better b'oat than Shamrock I, it is by
no means certain the Constitution is better than the
Columbia, or at least but very, little better. All ex
perts agree that Lipton has brought over this time
the most dangerous challenger that ever came after
the cup, but they do not by any means agree that the
new defender is superior to her immediate predeces
sor. Accepting the statements of the experts as ap
proximately correct, it is evident that no matter what
rate of odds New York money is able to put on the
betting the outlook is by nomeass satisfactory.
WHILE the American people have so often
beaten British challengers of the America's
cup that there has grown up among us a
confident. feeling that we can always win, there is none
the less evident in the reports from New York a
growing feeling of uncertainty as to the outcome this
time. It is true' that an English syndicate th^ raised
the sum of $150,000 to bet on Shamrock II had no
difficulty. in finding New Yorkers to put up $250,000
against it, but the rate of betting is not a sure sign of
the real odds in the co'ntest.- New York is full of rich
men who are willing to bet on anything, and when
their patriotism is aroused, 'as in this case, they would
meet any bluff the British could put up and give
odds at that.

There was not even any gossip to keep us interested. Some
body in greatest secrecy went around telling how Frank Caro
lan took grand baths. But we all suspected as much, and are
trying it ourselves. If it makes our sallow cheeks as pink as
Cardan's there won't be any complaint.

The only real fun I did have was when I went to the beach
to watch the merry bathers. I will have to confess, however,
that the way Mrs. Henry Scott clutched the ropes while prac
ticing a step that on dry land would be calculated to damage
the chandelier did make me hold any breath. I must not for
get to ask Greenway the very first opportunity I get whether
that embroidered smoking cap he wore while swimming was
the some Joe Tobin wore when playing polo. However, now
that 1 think of it, I am convinced that it cannot be. Tobin's
cap was fastened with an elastic, which was twisted around hia
ears and under his chin. Greenway's cap Just stayed on
naturally Besides, with the polo cap Tobin always carried
a brobdlngnagain toothpick, which he called his stick- I never
saw Greenway bring a stick Into the water.
Wasn't it a surprise when Mrs. R. Gllman Brown was defeat
ed? I for one, could hardly realize it. You should have seen
her the morning of the famous game as she came on the
links. She walked with an easy stride, and had a look that
said "It's hardly worth while playing for the championship,
for, of course, I shall be the winner."
And after-oh! oh! oh!
But she Is enthusiastic about golf. She came back to town
with Dr. McMonagle. and during the entire trip, from 11:30
to 4;10, she never ceased talking golf.
' I considered It a real blessing when we got news that
Princess Hatzfeldt had settled with the Huntlngtons for six
millions. There was something to gossip about. Some out
siders at Del Monte were saying that in elite circles they never
talk They must, not have been around when we were dis
cussing the affalfe of the Hatzfeldts. I heard so much that
really I cannot remember half of what I was told. I recall
a very sad part, though, of how fondly it was hoped that tha
stork would call upon the Princess and help her keep the mil
lion that, should she die without issue, was to return to tha
Huntington estate.
Then there was another thrilling tale of the Prince snub
bing Mrs H. K. Huntington and thereby causing the nephew
to hate the adopted daughter with an undying hatred
But everything is all patched now. The six millions have
no conditions attached to them. I would not be astonished if
the Prince actually did snub Mrs. H. E.
ONE OF THE THREE NEW BATTLESHIPS TO BE BUILT
FOR GREAT BRITAIN TO BE NAMED KING ED WARD VII
I ..HAVE just got back from Del Monte, knowing more about
gentlemen's calves and ankles and hosiery than I ever be
; lieved it possible for "one woman to learn in the course
..of a well spent life. Since my return I have been rack
ing my brains to learn the cause of this generous exposure,
and the only satisfactory conclusion that I have been able
to arrive at is that the trend, of -the times demands that the
word "leg" become once again a part of a well-bred lady's vo
cabulary. .
Certainly no girl whose mother was a lady could calmly
look on that wonderful display of underpinnings and then re
tire to her boudoir and discuss with her nearest and dearest
"his lovely limbs." The girls told me that the fashionable
knee breeches that our beaus affect have given them a keen
insight Into man's life. For instance, they claim that they
can understand just how a bald man feels when he occupies
a front row seat at avcomic opera show and just why he wants
to be there. -<Â«^ V : -Â¦.. .
.Of course, , every girl had a favorite pair of legs. The
Prince's dainty and well-turned 'ankles 1 made many a maid's
heart beat a tattoo, while again some preferred the robust Will
Crocker calf, or, again, the chunky, bulgtng knee that goes
with the Downey Harvey figure. As for myself, I must con
fess that'if Mayor Phelan would join the ballet I would spend
all my pin money for front row seats. There is something so
aristocratic about the Mayor's legs. His ankles, I will admit,
are a bitâ knotty, his kneesâ knotty, but his firm, shapely calves
plainly show to me that he is of a poetic temperament.
. But in this matter of legs there is no accounting for taste.
I have seen girls stretch their necks .way out of. their high
collars to watch. Greenway -as he tripped along the 'links. I
should consider.' that the line from his ! knee ' to his ankle is
too short for beauty, but many girls maintain that it Is all In
splendid proportion. I will have to admit, however, that I did
not give my undivided attention to Greenway's legs. I was al
ways too busy watching him draw in the sturdy strap that
enriched his " manly waistâ an arrangement he always pre
ceded by the preliminary movements of a sailor about to dance
a hornpipe.
I really felt sorry for Dick Tobin. I do not believe that he
had one solitary sincere admirer. It was so , hard for us girls
to make up our minds concerning him. His right one was not
half bad, but the left oneâ well, no one was courageous enough
to risk her arstitlc reputation by' speaking one word in its
favor.
That week of sports was about- the dullest thing I ever
expect to be iw*on. We all got bored to such an extent that
we confided our tale of woe to one another. Over- at the club
they said no one was spending any money. I heard continual
bewailings because Peter Martin and Clarence Pollis were not
among those present. They, I was told, livened things up last
year considerably. No matter what they said, however, I
know some money was spent, because Major Rathbone could
not get up in time to attend the pony races. When he did get
For a' long time the fury of the public against a'

BY SALLY SHARP.
Such is the record of progress made in the chief
industries of the South under the protective system,
and the minor industries have kept pace with them,
yet the political leaders of the white people of that
section are again talking of assailing the fiscal system
under which all that progress has been made. Could
political folly go further without becoming outright
madness?
To no other part of the Union has the Dingley
tariff carried a greater benefit than to the South. Un
der its influence the -manufacturing enterprises of
that section have gone forward by leaps and bounds.
South Carolina has now more cotton mills in opera
tion than any other State in the Union, with the ex
ception of Massachusetts. 1 Official -figures issued by
the Government show that in the Southern States the
capital invested in cotton mills has increased from
$21,976,000 to $150,000,000; the cotton manufactured
from 188,744 bales to 1,597,000 bales. The cottonseed
oil industry was in its infancy twenty years ago, only
$3,500,000 being invested in the business. Now the
cottonseed oil capitalization is $50,000,000. The yearly
output of Southern pig iron in 1880 was 397,300 tons.
Last year it was 2.604,671 tons. The Southern coal
mined in that year was 6,049,471 tons. In 1900 the coal
output had increased eightfold, amounting to 48, 192,
053 tons. The railway mileage increased during the
twenty years from 20,612 to 53,000.
Since drowning men clutch at straws, it is not sur
prising that Democratic leaders should grasp at any
thing that even promises a means of escape from
Bryan, but of all the follies committed in the name
df party politics, none could exceed that of the people
of the Southern States 'if they should now undertake
to destroy the tariff under which they have attained
a degree of prosperity they have never before known
and which, a few years ago, it seemed improbable
they would ever attain.
Following along the same line the Atlanta Consti
tution recently said: "When the tariff schedule has
been diverted from encouragement to American trade
at large, to the special enrichment of a few favored
individuals, it is time to have a revision in favor of
the people. As well allow a party of bandits to decide
uppxi the. restoration of booty as expect the Repub-
Jic^n; party to free itself from the tariff looters of the
TOBiitry/r: -Only through a political upheaval driving
out the party in power can reform be brought about."
Several of the leading Democratic papers in Demo
cratic States have already declared in favor of bring
ing the old issue to the front. Thus the St. Louis
Republic says: "The perpetuation of the high pro
tective tariff threatens now to precipitate a trade war,
waged against this country by a European trade alli
ance, which 'would be of infinite costliness to Ameri
can trade. The high protective tariff now only fur
ther enriches the American trusts. It taxes the Amer
ican consumer for this sole purpose. It is time to
abolish the high protective tariff." Â¦
Such leaders have been prompt to take advantage
of every rumor of the time that can be used for the
purpose of fanning discontent with the tariff as it
stands. They not only make use of the rumors, but
they sometimes resort to an abuse of them by exag
gerating them or placing wrong constructions upon
them. Thus it seems not improbable that the elimi
nation from politics of Bryan and his free-silver craze
will mean a renewal of the assaults upon the tariff,
and the country will be involved once more in a con
test over its fiscal policy, resulting in disturbances
that will seriously interfere with business.
AMONG the many Democrats searching around
after an issue, upon which to make campaigns
in the immediate future it is not strange that
some of them should deem it possible to find one in
the tariff. They remember that under the leadership
of Cleveland they won a national victory on that
question, but they have forgotten what happened
next. Recalling that a free-trade agitation put the
Government in their hands and ignoring the fact that
it also took work and wages from the hands of labor,
they are ready again to revive the old contention in
the hope that once more the offices will be theirs.

Breakfast to Colonel Hepburn.
Mr. Nelll had the part of Lord Goring
that Herbert Kelcey introduced to us
some six -years ago at the Baldwin, and
Mr. Neill did some very good work in the
part. It is a pleasant role to play, this
of the gentle aristocrat, who hides his vir
tues and flaunts his amiable vices, and
Mr. Nelll neared lovableness In the part.
His slight native drawl is a useful prop
erty, and comes in conveniently for Lord
Goring. Frank MacVicars was a manly
Lord Chiltern, not always quite convinc
ing: on the emotional side, perhaps, but
his work keyed always to a clean, re
strained, gentlemanly pitch. The Earl of
Caversham gave John \V. Burton a good
opportunity as one of his excellent testy
old gentlemen, in this case Lord Goring's
papa, who is "one of those parents who
have the inevitable knack of turning up
at the wrong time," as Lord Goring
pathetically puts it.
But perhaps to Miss Chapman belong
the honors of the evening, for her de
lightfully clever portrayal of Mrs. Cheve
ley, the adventuress de luxe of the play.
She gave this refined and artistic adven
turess "a grenlus by day and a beauty by
night"â with a charming and even bril
liant touch, and looked her very hand
somest in some stunning gowns. In the
third, act, ', where the dramatic interest
surges, she does some quite unexception
able work, and Mr. Neill is also at his
best here. Julia Dean has Wilde's epi
grammatic ingenue's part, and is fit and
pretty in it, the epigram leaving her pret
ty mouth with quaint ease and sparkle.
If only the whole thing- could move some
thing more swiftly, something more light
ly, there would be. little to cavil at in the
whole performance, but assuredly one
feels at times â In the waits â as if it were
one's sheer duty to get out and push
behind. But it's a play that will surely
draw, and was hugely enjoyed by a good
house, when it "began to begin" last
night, i . Â¦ GUISARD.

It was a very creditable performance

last night of "An Ideal Husband," bar
ring the interminable intervals between
acts. The first two acts are by no means
swift in themselves, being deficient in
action and relying almost wholly upon
the deftness and ease of the dialogue, and
when to this inherent leisureliness is add
ed the long waits It is not easy to keep
up the Interest. ; â¢ '

held the audience spellbound the entire
time they occupied the stage. Powell,
the magician, who looks not unlike the
famous Hermann, is very clever and
mystified the audience for half an hour.
His box trick is one of the cleverest ever
seen here. The La Vallee trio, two of
whom are harpists of great skill, while
the other is a talented violinist, met with
a warm reception and are sure to please
music lovers. James Aldrlch Libby,
Katheryn Trayer and John D. Gilbert
presented a musical skit entitled "The
Debutante." The skit gave Libby an op
portunity to introduce several songs,
which he rendered most artistically. Miss
Trayer is clever and Gilbert is a "whole
show." The reappearance of Mile. Lotty
in new "poses plastique". was greeted
heartily. She is as shapely as ever and
with the aid of the calcium man makes a
vision that would satisfy a lotus eater.
The Five Sunbeams are lively misses who
present a sort of rough and tumble act
and the biograph is up to its usual stand

GOOD AS USUAL
PRELATE OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH WHO REACHED THIS CITT
YESTERDAY AND IS THE FIRST DELEGATE FOR THE COMING
CONVENTION TO ARRIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
Yesterday afternoon Holmes recognized
one of his assailants on Kearny street,
and calling Policeman Prowse. he pointed
him out to him. Prowse immediately
placed the fellow under arrest. He gave
his name as Edward James and his occu
pation as that of a machinist. He will
be charged with an attempt to commit
robbery to-day.
Holmes offered resistance and was se
verely clubbed about the head. While the
robbers were searching- him fdr valuables
a special officer appeared and the gang
took to its heels.
George Holmes, who hails from Ukiah,
had an unpleasant experience with five
robbers on Clay street, near Kearny, late
Saturday night.
Holmes had been to the theater and
while walking along Kearny street he
noticed two men following hlmi. Suspect
ing Â¦ that they were bent on robbing him
he walked into a drug 1 store, hoping to
elude them. Shortly afterward he started
for the Adams House on Clay street. As
he reached the entrance to the hotel he
was suddenly set upon by five men, two
of whom he recognized as being the fol
lowers who had followed him from the
theater.

p-râ a HE RIGHT REVEREND ETH
II ELBERT TALBOT, Episcopal
I Bishop of the Diocese of Central
\\ Pennsylvania, arrived here yes
terday, accompanied by his wife
and daughter, and is staying at the
Occidental. He is the first bishop
to arrive for the Episcopal con
vention \ that takes place in this
city next month. In an interview he
stated yesterday that he expects that this
will be the most largely attended conven
tion of its kind ever held in the history
of the church. Every diocese, he says,
will send four laymen and: four clerical
delegates. There will be eighty dioceses
represented, making a total of 640 dele
gates entitled to seats in the convention.
Bishop Talbot expects that many of these_
delegates will be accompanied by their
friends to this city, who will remain dur
ing the entire convention.
Bishop Talbot formerly had charge of
the Diocese of Wyoming and Idaho. Be
fore he left to take charge in the East he
arranged to build a cathedral at Laramie,
Wyo. He was called East, however, be
fore the work was completed. Last week
he had the pleasure of seeing the cathe
dral formally dedicated. The edifice cost
JT5.000.
The noted cleric spent yesterday sight
seeing and receiving calls. His first pub
lic appearance will be next Sunday, when
he will preach at Grace Episcopal Church.
Memorial services will probably be held
in the Lutheran churches of Oakland and
Alameda next Sunday.
In his. congregation the late pastor took
the Interest of a father in his family.
His influence was by no means conftnod
to his own flock, however. He was known
and loved all over the State. There was
not a Lutheran clergyman in California,
the preacher said, who had "not at
one time or another received help and in
spiration from the late pastor of St.
Paul's, .and in many a humble home in
remote corners of the State the place of
honor is given to christening, confirma
tion or marriage certificate signed by Ja
x;ob M. Buehler.
He spoke of the beautiful home life of
the deceased, of his merciful death and
the .rest in the great beyond which he
had so Justly earned. Speaking of the
funeral he called attention to the fact
that of the hundreds who had attended
the majority had been baptized, confirmed
or married by Pastor Buehler, some of
them all three. He was a man. Rev.
Nelander said, to whom they fÂ«ll felt able
to go to in times of trouble or doubt. And
they went, he continued, in the full as
surance of having 1 their troubles light
ened, their doubts dispelled. -- '.
Memorial services were held last even
ing at th German Lutheran Church and
the First English Lutheran Church. Rev.
E. Nelander preached the sermon at the
latter place of worship. He referred feel
ingly to the great loss the Lutheran
church had sustained. He spoke of the
lato pa'stor aa the father of the church.
Love, he said, was the dominating trait
In the life and character of the man who
had gone. This love was the result of his
firm faith in Christ, to the strength of
which his whole life testified.
The pall-bearera, all members of St.
Paul's vestry, were H. Wunder, H. Fred
ericks, F. Boese, J. Hencken. C. Foertcli,
I* Schmidt, Jacob Schwerdt and William
Ohm. They carried the remains of their
pastor from the home on Eddy street to
the church, and later from the hearse to
the. graveside. The following named cler
gymen acted as honorary pall-bearers:
Revs. Runkel, Jacobson, J. H. Theiss, H.
Hagist, B." Lange, J. H. Schroeder, O.
Groensberg- and Stensrud.
The Rev. J. H. Theiss of Oakland
preached a funeral sermon in German,
and the Rev. J. H. Witte oi Alameda told
in English of what the passing away of
their "father" and familiar friend meant
to the Lutheran churches of California.
The mortal remains of the late Rev.
Jacob M. Buehler, pastor at the time of
his death of St. Paul's Lutheran Church,
were yesterday, laid to .rest at Mount Oli
vet Cemetery, The coffin was carried on
its last journey by the vestrymen of the
church and escorted by a guard of fellow
clergymen. The funeral services were
held In the church for which the deceased
had done so much. They were attended
to the limit of the building's capacity
by the men, women and children who,
through intimate association and familiar
acquaintance had learned to call him
father.
Following the parade, literary exercises
will be held in Mechanics' Pavilion, at
probably 1:39 or 2 o'clock. The principal
address will be by Walter Macarthur,
president of the day. The oration will be
by James G. Magulre, and Andrew
Furuseth, secretary of the Sailors' Union,
will also deliver an address. In addition
there will be selections by the Berlin
sisters, solos by "Will C. Carleton and Wil
liam McDonald, late of the Bostonians.
A grand ball at the Pavilion in the even
ing will complete the day's celebration.
The chief event of the day will be the
parade. Grand Marshal Michael Casey
met his aids yesterday and completed the
details, Everj' union band in the city
will be in line, so that there will be no
dearth of music. The hackmen to the
number of SOO will be in line with their
vehicles, each carrying its quota of
women who are members of the various
unions. A feature of the procession will
be the glass blowers, who are to carry
glass canes made for the occasion and
which will be auctioned off at the Pa
vilion in the evening for the benefit of the
cause of labor.
The line of march of the procession is
from East and ilarket streets, along
i Market to Montgomery, thence to Cali
* fornia. to Kearny, to Market, to Van Xess
avenue, to Bush street. The line then
countermarches to Larkin street and then

citing. National Parlor already has whist
and bowling teams, and as many of its
members are crack shots, it was felt that
a shooting club could be organized which
Â¦would prove creditable. Â¦ /

BOHEMIANS TOO MUCH
FOB THE FOBESTEBS
Easily Win the Baseball Game on
the Grounds at Golden'
Gate.
OAKLAND, Sept. Lâ The first of a ser
ies of games between local lodges and
clubs was played at the Golden Gate
grounds this afternoon between teams
from the Foresters and the Bohemians.
These games are attracting a great deal
of attention among the lodges and clubs
of Oakland on account of the baseball
enthusiasm displayed by these organiza
tions. Charlie Kohl was the manager of
the victorious Bohemians, and to his work
Is due the formation of such an excellent
team. Fiege, the pitcher of the Bohemi
ans, made the best single showing in the
game. He allowed the Foresters but
seven hits, and made three hits and two
runs himself. The best play made by
the Foresters was a double by Choynski
from left field to McKernan at second
base.
Next Sunday the Bohemians will play
the Dewey Theater team, and the Sun
day following will play the team from the
Elks.

San Francisco 7, Oakland!:
For six Innings of the game at Recre
ation grounds yesterday afternoon
E wing's eccentric bah players acted as if
they had come in contact some time in
their lives with the real diamond "article.
Then they gave an exhibition of a reck
less daring in error making that brought
bad words to the lips of the pplitician
manager, who has lost more cigars bet
ting on his team than can be found in a
tobacco emporium.
The score stood even, each team having
a unit in the run column. Then Moski
man, who had been pitching splendid ball,
lost his unsolvable- ways and the Wasps
began stinging. Three hits, coupled with
four errors, gave the local team five runs.
In the following inning Moskiman was
bunched on the anvil for a couple from
which another run resulted.
SAN FRANCISCO.
Lmtil the fateful seventh inning it
looked as if the Dudes and the Wasps
would continue their deadlock throughout
the regularly allotfe&-hime innings and
possibly for a few more, but the fans
were doomed to disappointment.
Whalen was seldom .hit by the Dudes
but he gave out eight free transportation
privileges. Moskiman failed to walk any
of the local men, but hits were disastrous
ly bunched- on him on two occasions.

AT THE FINISH
Tralee Boy, T. J. Cronin's fast grey
hound puppy, ran through the open stake
yesterday at Union Park and wound up
his great work by beating Eugene Geary's
seasoned qourser America for final honors.
The sensational running of the young
dog caused no end of favorable comment,
and the nominators in the Futurity stake
showed that they appreciated the fact .that
Tralee Boy's name was inadvertently kept
from the list of entries in that event. The
youngster opened by beating Naughty
Girl pointless. In the second round he
won a close course from Spiteful, a favor
ite at slight odds, and in the next out
pointed Liberator. Mayflower was the
next to fall, the Boy retiring her without
a point, after an undecided.
The talent went wrong on the young
black dog In the semi-final. Holding
Wedgewood as choice they gave 5 to 2
that he would get the decision from the
puppy. When Tralee Boy had three good
points to his credit Wedge wood secured
the kill and put himself out. America
and Harlean Gladys followed this course
and stared after a hard hare. America
showed ro the better advantage because
of Gladys' willingness to lay back and
let him do the work. As she dashed in
at the kill the speed she displayed told
plainly that she had not done /her best.
America's hard go forced him down in
the betting, though he had considerable
backing at 3 to 5 for the final. From
the slips Tralee Boy led by a good mar
gin, and won out by a score of 4 to 2.
The general opinion at the close of the
day's sport was that in Tralee Boy his
owner had the best young greyhound of
the season. That a match between the
Boy and the Futurity winner will be run
is now almost a certainty.
Dewdrop, a stake favorite, was beaten
in the run-down by Onward, a 20 to 1
shot. Spiteful beat Tyrone Prince: Aga
memnon beat Homer Boy at 5 to 1;
Crockett Hill beat Bonnie Pasha at 5 to 2;
Olita beat Floodgate at 5 to 3; Governor
Mac beat Controller; Frisco Lad beat
John Doe; Liberator beat First Foot at
2 to 1; Castaway beat Frisco Lad at 3 to 1.
Considerable play , was made on 'the
chances of Futurity candidates in the
long odds book at the park yesterday.
Aeolus, Freeze Out and Cold Shivers were
held- at top prices at 6 to 1. Tame Tralee,
Sir Pitt and Emin Bey at 25; Pasha Ken

Boy Has a Narrow Escape.
James Lyons, aged .13 years, was
knocked down by car Â£61 of the Ken
tucky-Street line Saturday night and that
he was not killed was due to the fact that
he was wearing an old pair of shoes. He
was thrown to the ground in such a man
ner that the forward wheels of the car
just caught the shoe on his left foot. He
would have "been dragged under the car
had not the rotten leather given Way. The
only injuries . he received were minor

Special Officer Jennings Has a Pecn-
lar Notion of His Privileges.
Thomas A. Jennings and David Clark,
special officers employed by McNab &
Smith, entered the lodging house at 1CC5
Stockton street yesterday and were amus
ing themselves by looking into the rooms
when the proprietor, John Dellamonica.
asked them what they wanted. Jennings
pulled a special's star from his pocket
and said they were special' officers. Del
lamonica requested them to go away, and
after some persuasion they left.
About an hour later they returned and
Jennings walked into a room after two
ladies who had called to see the oc
cupants. He was asked to go away, and
to their surprise pulled a revolver out of
his pocket and pointing it at the male
occupant said he would shoot if he made
any demonstration. The women screamed
and Dellamonica ran to see what was the
matter. As soon as he appeared on the
scene Jennings pointed the revolver at
him and the proprietor grappled with
him, forcing him out to the street.
Dellamonica called at police headquar
ters and made a complaint against the
two men. who were arrested in a saloon
at Pacific and Dupont streets by Police
men Gould and Holmes and Special
Officer Daggett. When searched each had
a revolver and a star m his pocket. On
the complaint of Dellamonica a charge of
exhibiting a deadly weapon in a rude and
threatening manner was preferred
against Jennings, and Clark was "booked
for intoxication. They alleged that they
belonged to Morse's patrol, but Morse,
who was advised of their allegation,
denied knowing them and they admitted
they were employed by McNab & Smith.

The Corinthian fleet, with Commodore
H. D. Hawks on the flagship May in com
mand, cruised up to Petaluma drawbridge
on Saturday night, and yesterday con
tinued-on up to Lakeville. To-day the
yachts will return to their moorings at
Tlburon. â¢
The San Franciscos, having called their
cruise to Crakes Bay off until next Sat
urday, had no / event on, their schedule,
but the sloop Cygnus and the yawl Phyl
lis^cruised on Saturday afternoon to the
upper bay and will return to their moor
ings to-day. Yesterday the sloops Mis
chief, Anita. Nixie and Thetis were under
way, the last named sailing up to Mc-
Nears Â¦ Landing and anchoring there.
While 'at anchor the yawl Spray, with
Frank and Mrs. Bartlett on board, sailed
by on the return from a two weeks'
cruise up the river. The Corinthian sloop
Cupid, the catboat Caprice, the yawl Kit
tiwake and other yachts also cruised in
the upper bay. There was a good breeze
throughout the day, which freahened con
siderably off El Campo.and Sausalito, but
was accompanied by little sea.-.
The proposed crujse of the San Fran
cisco and California Yacht Clubs to
Drakes Bay during the Admission day
holidays promises to be highly successful,
it being expected that about a dozen
boats will make it. Among them will be
the flagship Ramona, which is on her way
up from the Santa Barbara channel, the
schooner Chispa, the yawl Tramontana,
.the sloops Thetis and Cygnus, with four
or five California yachts. The yawl Royal
is at present on the ways at South San
Francisco, but will be at her Sausalito
mooorings before the end of the week,
and will probably take part in the cruise.
Some of the yachtsmen at least will try
to leave in good time next Saturday morn
ing, so as to take advantage of as much
of the ebb tide as possible. ""^
Entries for the annual regatta of the
Pacific Inter-Club Yacht Association close
at 6 p. m. on Wednesday with Orlo East
wood, secretary. The yachts will be di
vided into the usual six classes, and will
be sent off to a one-gun start. As the
San Franciscos and Californias will be
returning from Drakes Bay on Admis
sion day, not many entries are to be"- ex
pected from those two clubs. The Val
lejo Yacht Club will be represented by
Commodore A. E. Chapman's sloop Helen,
which her owner believes can beat Frank
Stone's Presto. A large proportion of. the
entries will come from the Corinthian
Yacht Club, as the Encinals.have pretty
well gone out of business as a yachting
club, and' the South Bays will probably
not send up any boats. The most inter
esting racing will be in the thirty-foot,
thirty-six-foot and yawl classes.."

Origin of Gibraltar.
The Rock of Gibraltar has long been
known to all the civilized world. The an
cients called It Calpe, and with Abyla.
now Ceuta. the northern point of Africa,
about fifteen miles across the strait, it
formed ,the "Pillars of Hercules," long be
lieved to be the western end of the world.
It was first fortified in 711, when the Sara
cens invaded Spain under the command of
Tarik Ibn-Zeyad, after whom the rock
was called Gebel-Tarik, or Hill of Tarik,
later corrupted into Gibraltar. It was the
scene of many sieges and battles. In 1704
the combined Dutch and English fleets
captured it from the Spanish. -England's

to-morrow night and Tuesday night to fix
the tax rate for the coming year. A pro
vision in the town charter makes It neces
sary for the board to levy the rate of tax
ation on the first Monday in September
but, as to-morrow will be a holiday, a
second meeting will be held Tuesday
night to make the tax rate ordinance
legal. The j board has virtually agreed
upon the rate of taxation It will levy. The
75 cent tax limit for municipal purposes
will be levied. This will he increased by
about 35 cents through bonded indebted
ness tax and special tax. making the total
levy dn each $100 of property valuation
about {1 10.
It is loyally, explained by the London
papers that King Edward sold .off the
greater, part of the Windsor Castle sher
ries because modern â¢ taste rejects this
strongly alcoholized I wine, and that
enough sherry had been laid down at the
castle to last a century at the present
rate of use. The money obtained will be
used to buy lighter wines, and more ac
cording to the modern taste. It is curi
ous that here In the tropics sherry, a
strong liquor, is still in prime favor. It
is â¢ one of the great wines of the world.
Old-time Britons liked their "sack,"

HAYWARDS, Sept. 1.â Plans for the
Catholic Fair, to be given at the ' Hay-
Colonel Reed, who is president of . the
Hidalgo Club, is indignant at the asper
sions cast upon his character by Con
sul Coney. Reed particularly takes ex
ceptions to the 'charge .made by one
Frank Rodegus that he (R&ed) "was a
waiter- in a restaurant in the City of
Mexico. Reed denies the charge em
phatically, and says that Rodegus is a
myth who has been created in the fer
tile Imagination of Consul Coney. Reed
and his fellow members df the Hidalgo
Club assert that malice alone prompts
Consul Coney to belittle the president of
the organization.
"It Is only with the desire to disrupt
the Hidalgo Club," said Reed last night,
"that Consul Coney has seen fit to make
disparaging remarks about my reputa
tion. The celebration of Mexican inde
pendence has all along been given under
the auspices of the club, and. over. a
month ago we made official announce
ment that the celebration would be held.
Long after that it dawned upon Coney
to give a counter celebration, at which
he intended to shine as the main factor.
"We question the good taste of Coney
in seeking subscriptions from wholesale
dealers to pay the expenses of his cele
bration. We represent the masses of
the Mexican colony, and we pay for our
celebration out of our own pocket. Coney
gives no account of his stewardship.
He is answerable to no one, as he con
stitutes himself supreme, dictator of the
whole affair.
"I regret that Mr. Coney should so far
forget the dignity of his high office as
to cast slurs upon me. It is small busi
ness for him ; to . be engaged in. -. I can
produce my credentials showing that I
am in fact a colonel in the Mexican
army, and they 1 are at his disposal
whenever he- wishes to see them. His
undignified utterances , do. not .worry tho
Hidalgo Club, which- 6 will â¢ make | due
preparations, as in the past, â¢ to cele
brate fittingly the anniversary *of Mexi
can Independence and .the birthday of
President Porflrio Diaz. i- .' ./
The war in the Mexican colony waxes
warmer and warmer, and Colonel Juan
Guillermo Reed, the president of the
Hidalgo Club, still holds the center of
the stage. Mexican Consul Coney ' re
iterates his statements that the gallant
colonel is no man to act as president of
the day when the Mexicans celebrate
their Independence day in this city, and
now comes James Baumberger, presi
dent of the Commercial Salt Company,
with the announcement that there are
"breakers ahead" for Colonel Reed.
Baumberger has had some business deal
ings with Reed which were not alto
gether satisfactory, and he proposes to
seek satisfaction in the courts. Baum-/
berger says that he has already placed
the matter in the hands of his attor
ney and that shortly both a criminal and
a civil suit will be iileq* in which Colonel
Â¦Reed will appear as defendant.
BERLIN, Sept. 1.â Last week's Boerse
was very dull, but the undertone - was
somewhat firm. The public, which recently
showed a disposition, to resume Boerse
business, has again- wholly withdrawn.
Transactions were accordingly confined
exclusively to professional dealers. A
favorable symptom, however, was that
'the week's untoward political events did
not produce any marked effect.
Canadian and Northern Pacific had an
active week, the former advancing to
109.10, while Northern Pacific preferred
went to 98.10. Â¦ Both showed renewed
activity yesterday, under London's lead.
Altogether, barring accidents and the
Inevitable Government borrowing, ! the
Stock* Exchange seems to be looking in
the direction of more prosperous times.
Mining shares in a modest way showed
the general feeling of encouragement. The'
deposition of Whlttaker Wright at the
meeting of the Le Roi Mining Company
(limited) added decidedly to the joyous
ness of the. situation. The Rand now
boasts 365 stamps, and one new permit to
resume was Issued during the week. West
Australians .were decidedly stronger, out
side buyers .venturing in, although
timidly.
There seems small doubt that an aval
anche of criticism will accompany the
new loan, which will inevitably be a-n
nounced, and this will operate as a
serious setback for the present more
hopeful tone of the Stock Exchange. In
the meantime the small, but steady,
absorption of tilt-edged securities which
has been noted for the last fortnight con
tinues.
Business in home railroad stocks was
slightly better throughout the week, al
though the statements of twelve leading
roads, while showing an increase of Â£192,
000 sterling in passenger earnings during
the last nine weeks, showed a decrease of
Â£308,000 in freight earnings, as against the
corresponding period of last year.
The American department of the Stock
Exchange continues- very active, coal
shares leading on further talk of com
munity of interest coupled with the
aspect of the steel strike, which is re

vance in Erie took bargain hunters rather
oft their guard, but there was consider
able speculative demand even at the rise,
on the, rumor that Erie common would go

Other features which seem to be per
sistently ignored by optimistic financial
critics is the fact that the Government
has never professed that the last consol
issue would provide for active operations
in South Africa beyond October 15.
Easy money continues to be a feature.

The said Insurance companies claim that It
was entirely due to the act or neglect of tho
San Lorenzo Water Company that the fire of
April 12 at Haywards assumed its. serious pro
portions, and claim that with a' proper and
adequate water supply said fire could readily,
have been extinguished in its incipiency; and
c!alm that absence of said proper and adequate
water supply was entirely due to the act or
neglect of said San Lorenzo Water Company.
The following companies, through their
San Francisco agents, have signed the
agreement:
The agreement which the interested in
surance companies have signed recites
the following:
A month after the fire, Superintendent
Darling of the water works committed
Fuicide at his home in Haywards, having
become despondent through brooding over
the destruction of the cannery and the
circumstances surrounding the fire.
Insurance Companies' Points.
Tho pipe main that had been run down
B street at Haywards was "deaa-ended"
at a point about opposite the Southern
Pacific Company's depot. Arrangement*
had been made to place a hydrant there
and to run a lateral connecting main to
the cannery several hundred feet east of
the depot. There had been some delay
because of correspondence between the
cannery owners and the water company
concerning the payment for that connec
tion, but this was adjusted a month be
fore the fire. Frequent demand was
thereafter made for the service, as the
cannery was shortly to open for the sea
son's work, but the night : of the fire
arrived and- there were no hydrants with
in a mile of the scene. The firemen and
townspeople were compelled to stand
helpless and see the acres of buildings
licked up by the roaring flames.
It is upon thl.-s statement that the insur
ance companies have decided to proceed
against the San Lorenzo Water Company
to recover the amount they paid to Hunt
Bros. The total insurance money received
by the cannery people was $91,500. Their
loss was thus reduced to J10.000 or $15,000.
The claim is made by the insurance
companies that the water company was
directed to complete these extensions
nearly a month before the fire occurred
and. that their failure to do so left the
cannery without the protection against
fire to which it was entitled and for which
seasonable demand had been made.
Hose Falls Far Short.
The Haywards Fire Department re
sponded, but found its nearest hydrant
was so far from the cannery buildings
that the hose was short from 1200 to 1500
feet. The water company had laid a main
to within 200 feet of the cannery grounds,
but had not completed the pipe-line to the
cannery, where hydrants were to be
erected.
The Immense buildings, the valuable
machinery therein contained and all of
the structures, cannery, warehouses and
can plant, including many thousand dol
lars' worth of tin plate, manufactured
cans, machinery and other paraphernalia
were burned to a worthless mass, only fit
for the scrap pile of a Junk-yard. The
fire occurred on the night of April 12.
Papers in the forthcoming litigation
have been under preparation by the law
firm of Van Ness & Redman of San
Francisco, and the documents are now
about ready to file.
The insurance .world is interested In this
prospective legal battle, for the questions
involved are of vast importance, not only
to the companies but to water supplying
corporations. The fight is to be made
upon the theory that tho San Lorenzo
Water Company, which supplies Hay
wards, neglected to furnish adequate ser
vice and that the immense losses could
have been prevented if there had been a
sufficient supply of water at hand for use
when the fire was in its inciplency.
Thirty insurance companies of San
Francisco have combined to prosecute a
$100.00-3 suit against the San Lorenzo
Water Company to recover the money
they were compelled to pay upon the total
loss caused by the burning of the Hunt
Bros.' cannery and can plant last spring
at Kaywards.

ON JAW OF A MASHER
Besents a Stranger's Familiarity anÂ«l
Gets Into the Coney Island
Police Station.
NEW YORK. Sept. l.-The fighting in
stincts of the McGovern family are ap
parently not confined to the male side.
Katie McGovern, a sister of Terry, twice
swung on a man's jaw to-night in the
Bowery at Coney Island as deftly as her
brother could have done. Instead of re
ceiving a purse for her cleverness. shÂ»
was locked up in the Coney Island polfce
station for disorderly conduct.
Katie went to Corsey Island to-day with
Charles Sehoop. While in the Bowery.
Schoop went a few yards ahead of his
companion, when a stranger, thinking her
alone, rpoke to her. She did not wait to
ask him his busings, but punched him
twice. Swinging first with her left, she
taught him a heavv blow behind the ear
and then drove her right flush on the
point of the jaw.
The man went down, and while he was
struggling to his feet a crowd gathered.
In the confusion tlie mnn disappeared. Ltit
Katie was arrested. The police said she
had evidently been dinine over well.
"Everything i? now ready for my next
ascent." said Dumont to the Journal cor
respondent to-day.
Weeks of prodigious labor since the
wreck of his ;ast balloon has created
another, and to-day, for the first time,
the aeronaut took things a bit leisurely.
PARIS. Sept. 1.â Santos Dumont. the
daring Brazilian aeronaut, has been
working day and night to complete a new
flying machine, his sixth, in which he
hopes to circle the Eiffel Tower and win
the Deutsch prize. The question of ex
pense never bothers him. Like Lipton, he
seeks the prize, no matter what it costs.
Carry Off the Deutsch
Prize.

Dilating upon what he called "the col
lapse of the Parliamentary system dur
ing: the recent stssion." he said it proved
that with a little pressure the united
Irish party crulJ get anything it wanted.
The Conservative papers to-day com
ment upon Redmond's speech as justify
ing the Government in taking "practical
measures to mitipate the nuisance of
Irish obstruction."
LONDON. Sept. 2.â John Redmond, M.
P.. spiking yesterday in Westport. Ire
land, tc-ok up the Conservative challenge
and characterized the policy of reducing
Ireland's representation in Parliament,
as hinted at by Balfour. and Chair.beniiln
during the recent Unionist demonstration
at Blerneim Palace, as absurd. He de
clared that the Irish people "can abso
lutely disregard such threats and rely
upon -.he provisions of (he act of union,
which settled the question of representa
tion."
NEW YORK, Sept. ;.-There has been a
rumor for the last few days that Richard
broker cf Ner.- York and Wantage was
negotiating for the purchase of the A. B.
Darling property near Ramsey's in Ber
gen County, New Jersey.
Inquiry shows that the person who. is
negotiating for the purchase Is not the
Tammany chieftain, but the millionaire,
George Crocker of California and New
York, and that the chances are he will
soon be a resident of Bergen County. The
property was formerly owned by A. B.
Darling, who made a fortune of several
Trillions by. investments in real estate in
New York.
When Darling died he left the Bergen
County property to his nephew, but his
wiaow has beÂ«>n its occupant most of the
time since. Mrs. Darling: made use of
the place to give fresh air to the poor
children of New York, who go to Darling
ton every summer for several weeks in
squads of. fifteen or twenty. Young Darl
ing has no desire to retain the property,
but he does not wish to act contrary to
his aunt s wishes, and the transfer of the
property now depends wholly upon what
rurs. Darling rays. Crocker has visited
the place several times and has ati-
Tiounced his intention, in the event of
Â£ u F, c J? asin8r ll - of taking down all the
fh v S a erecting a mansion on top
TRIES TO KILL
A POLICEMAN
NEW YORK, Sept. l.-Mrs. Carrie
Nation, the Kansas smasher, appeared
in New York this morning, and man
aged to get arrested by 5 o'clock in the
afternoon. She escaped from- her pre
dicament in time to lecture at Carnegie
Music Hall this evening and to distrib
ute songs and hatchets. Mrs. Nation
longed above all else to make the ac
quaintarce of the. women of- the tender
loin that she might administer words of
reproof and counsel. "
She spied a. marine at a Sixth-avenue
bar. "The idea," she said, v "Men wear
ing the uniform of, the United .=. States,
navy in here drinking poison! Isn't it
awful? Mr.' Barkeeper, why do you
keep open on Sunday like this? Isn't
there any law to stop you?".
"These are soft drinks," replied the
barkeeper. .
"Young man, don't ycfl try to deceive
me," rejoined Mrs. Nation.
She lifted a stein which was sitting in
front of one of the sailors and took a
sip of the nectar of Gambrlntas.
"Don't you try to fool me,-*' she con
tinued. ' "Tha^s beer, that is, and I
know beer when I taste it.** Y .
The crowd was meanwhile crying aloud
ntHioP"j ot '< ><-v)f ' Â»irs. Vv-iioti, Kiss
ing, her hand- to the multitude, was
finally placed on a car and taken down
to Twenty-third street after some diffi
culty, for she persisted in Â¦Â¦ talking to
everybody whom she met.
Five hundred persons heard i Mrs. Na
tion this evening at .Carnegie -^ Music
Hall. She was of the .opinion that .the
man who ' smoked was a "rum-soaked,
whisky-tainted, tobacco-smeared, satyr
faced, red-eyed devil." She clinched
these remarks by reciting poetry of a
home-made variety. Mrs. Nation told of
how she had rebuked a deacon . in a
Baptist church whom she had followed
into the smoking room of a parlor car
on which she had traveled to the? city.
She also spoke with bitterness of a,fel
low passenger who persisted in smok
ing in his own stateroom.
Then she rebuked women for wearing
corsets.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ven

Zealand, Samoan and Hawaiian ports
to-day. :. â¢
The Spreckels tug > Defiance sailed for
Coquille River Saturday- night. She goes
north to assist in salving the British bark
Baroda that went- on the beach last
Thursday. , Â¦
There were nine arrivals and seven de
partures up to 5 p. m. yesterday. Among
the latter were the Mariposa for Hono
lulu, colliers South Portland and Titanla
for Puget Sound, ' Oregonian for New
York, via Honolulu, and the Rosa
for southern ports. ~ f i
The British ship County of Haddington
is the only overdue quoted here.: She is
now out 211 days from New York for
Shanghai, and 90 per cent is being paid' on
her. The Cambrian King, a sister, ship
to the Cambrian Hills, which arrived
of August 17 at" 25 per cent." She is. 102
days out from Newcastle-on-Tyne for
Table Bay.
"Water Front Notes.
One of the smartest pieces of work ever
done on the front, considering the circum
stances, was the loading of the Mariposa
with 2000 tons of general merchandise in
a little more than thirty-six hours. The
vessel came down from the sugar, re
flnery,"coaled Friday morning, but it was
not until about noon that the work: of
loading actually began. The work went on
night and day, and by about 11 p. m.
Saturday the last ton was put aboard. To
Captain Howard, superintendent of the
company, belongs â¢ the credit, for It was
he- that had brought order out) of the
chaos caused by the strike. .'
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Mariposa sailed for Honolulu on time yes
terday morninsr. Every ounce of her 2000
tons of cargo was stowed and .every
passenger aboard at 10 a. m., and Captain
Howard at once ordered . the gangway
taken in. Twenty-five minutes later the
mail boat was passing Me'iggs wharf and
by 11 a. m. had said good bye to the pilot
and was headed full speed for Honolulu.
The full list cf the Mariposa's cabin
passengers was given in yesterday morn
ing's Call. V â - . .
Departure of the Mariposa.
The steamship Homer arrived early yes
terday morning unexpectedly from the
Pribilof Islands. {She is under" charter
to the North American Commercial Com
pany and went north to bring home the
season's take of sealskins. Judging from
the number brought home by the Homer
the weather must-have been very bad on
St. George Island and the catch â¢ was
small. Only 5572 skins were .taken there,
while on St. Paul Island 17,100 were taken.
Beside these the Homer brought down
twenty-five bundles of whalebone, a box
of fox and other skins,, thirteen bundles
of furs and fifteen barrels of fox skins.
Captain Donaldson called at Dutch Har
bor on the way home and made the run
from t there in ten days six hours. r : A
number of employes of the company came
home on the steamship.
Back From Seal Islands.
-.-Â¦ FROMSEATTLE. ........ -
The: French bark Anjou sailed from
Newcastle-on-Tyne five days, the British
ship Armlda twenty-five days and the
Italian ship Francisco Ciampa forty-eight
days before the Cambrian Hills, and are
etill on the way. The Ciampa sprang a
leak, however, and on March '25 last had
to put Into Gibraltar. The leak was slight
and was easily stopped. On April 18 she
made another start, having been detained
twenty-four days. ) ~
Took the- pilot on Saturday, August 81, to
the eastward of Point Reyes. Anchored at 9:30
p. m. off the north head in a thick' fog. Spoka
the- new French bark Colonel.de VHlebois

tude 130 west} Â¦/
Captain. McMahon In his report says:
Sighted the ship Clan MacKenzie August 26
and daily thereafter to port. Sighted the Far
allones August 31 and anchored inside the bar
In a thick fog. .Towed to port September 1.
The Cambrian Hills had thus recovered
her lost ( ground, but light and j variable
winds were now the order of the day. .In
these the latter must be the better boat,
for in Captain Evans' reports appears the
following: Â¦. . â¢. - -Â¦. . V. '
The Clan MacKenzie sailed from Liver
pool for San Francisco on April 22 with a
general cargo and the Cambrian Hills
from Newcastle-on-Tyne April 25, with a
cargo of coal, coke, pig Iron and flre
bricks. . The former crossed the equator
in the Atlantic on May 22 and the Cam
brian Hills followed ' her six days later.
The Clan MacKenzie thus gained three
days on the. first leg. Both vessels were
two "days In a very heavy gale off the
Straits of Magellan, and on July 6 the
Cambrian Hills rode out a storm in which
the barometer went down to 28.50. Heavy
gales, accompanied by snow, -was the lot
of the crews' of the two vessels rounding
the Horn, and then on July 31 the Mac-
Kenzie crossed the equator in the Pacific
and three days later was followed by the
Cambrian Hills. -\ â¢ / s '
Two British ships made port yesterday
morning after passages that were almost
identical. Ona . sailed from England threa
days ahead of ihe other, and it was a nip
and tuck race all the way. until August 25,
when both met off the coast. After that
they spoke each other . every day until
they cast anchor si^e by side in' the bay.

cessful Season in San Francisco
and Moves On.
Mammoth Show Finishes Most: Suc-
Ringlingr Bros.' Circus bade farewell for
the season to San Francisco last night
and went away with the assurance that
the people had fully appreciated rthe
splendid performance which this great
aggregation of tent artists has given.
People have come to realize from experi
ence of several seasons that the Ring
ling promise is something substantial,
something that is meant to be carried out
and is abundantly carried out. The
weather man has been good to the show,
and at each performance the entire seat
ing capacity of the tremendous tent has
been taxed to its utmost. Each year's
visit but adds to the popularity of the
Ringling Circus, and the next time it
comes to San Francisco it will find Its
hosts of friends Increased by other hosts
to whom the excellence of the entertain
ment has been described. ,'
i The last performance, given last night,
attracted a huge crowd, one that filled all
the seats and every inch of the bleachers.
It was foggy and chill'- and overcoat col
lars were kept up, but the liveliness of
the show caused as much laughter as
though It were moonlight and warm.
The performers were given closing
rounds of applause, and each act was
carried through with, if possible, even
more vim and snap than' at any other
time during the week. There was genuine
enthusiasm In the big ring, tent which
lasted until the last events, the races
round the track, had been decided.
Preparations tor moving the big outfit
were begun as soon as the last comers
had entered the r.ng tent. Then the
animal wagons were covered over, four
horses were attached to each and they
were drawn aside. The outside flap of the
tent was let down and rolled up. When
the spectators came out the animal tent
had disappeared.
As soon as the bleachers were empty,
gangs of men took them quickly to pieces
and piled them on big drays, ready for
use. Then the. orchestra chairs were at
tacked and the stands were demolished in
quick order. Bit by bit t .e fittings of the
ring came down and the apparatus used
d- v.he performers was hauled to the
ground and packed carefully away.
In the meantime the crowds had
gathered outside and watched with Inter
est the preparations for departure. Soon
after : 11 o'clock' the procession - of canvas
covered wagons and drays piled high with
planking and chairs,' tent coverings and
other circus necessities was started down
Sixteenth street. The cars were loaded
on the tracks, where a big row of electric
lights had been set up and the yard ap
peared as bright as day. Rapidly and
without confusion the animals were
placed aboard their respective cars and
made ready. for the journey to San Jose,
eachj-.beingyzealously.' watched by the
keepers. -. , : ,'.,> / '- :â¢ <
At" the railroad yard the busy scene con
tinued' until late in* the morning, and it
was daylight before j the last piece of
paraphernalia- had been 'placed In position
and started off. The RInglings open in

P.INGLINGS' BIG CIRCUS
I CLOSES ITS WEEK HERE
An extra detail of police wis placed on
guard last night and will probably be
continued for Fome time. ; "-
"We. are constantly exposed to sniping
tactics both in the frontand the rear,"
said 'Watchman Hebbard. '. "It is. almost
worth a man's life at night to poke his
head out of *.hat door," pointing to a
little aperture in the big gate. "Almost
as soon as It is opened, blng! comes a
bullet flying near. . These come from the
opposite side of the street, but we have
not as yet been able to locate the men
who do the shooting." â¢ .â¢ '
Shortly . after the shooting. Secretary
McLaughlin of the Brotherhood of Team
sters and: other officers were on the
scene, but denied that any one connected
with the brotherhood was concerned in
the shooting.
"We -have notified all â¢ our members,"
said' Mr. McLaughlin, "to keep free from
all this turmoil, and we do not believe
that any of them were concerned in this
shooting to-nlcrht. I think these people
In the barns are trying to get up a. scare
and were shooting at shadows." Â¦
About fifty men are on duty in the yards
and stables all night and are well pro-
Tided with means of defense.- !
News of the affray -. promptly reached
the police, and a large squad of officers
under the command of Sergeant Conboy
Â¦were soon on the scene. While the officers
were dispersing the gathering crowds,
Haisway walked toward Fourth street.
He apparently, was under the Influence of
liquor and was abusive to the police. He
was first arrested on the simple charge of
being drunk, but before being put into the
patrol wagon was searched and the pistol
was found on him, and then it was de
cided to press the more serious charges.
'According to Charles Hebbard, a special
watchman employed by the transfer com
pany, two messenger boys left the place
shortly before 9 o'clock. No sooner had
the gate been closed upon them than two
shots were fired from the' lumber pile
across the street, followed by another
volley in the rear, "apparently fired from
tome one of the houses on Perry street.
'1 ne men in ?.he barn rushed to the
windows, both on Bryant street and Perry
street, and returned the fire.
Diagonally across the street from the
entrance to the yard of the Overland
Freight Transfer Company is a low pile
of lumber which affords sufficient , con
cealment to any one watching the stables.
After 7 o'clock at night the street is
deserted except for a passing street car.
A couple of street lamps about fifty yards
on either- side of the stable yard gate
afford but scant light. The place is.. an
ideal one for an ambuscade, and although
the -men" employed about the transfer
stables are constantly on the alert, in the
semi-darkness they have not always been
able to discern those who for the past
three nights have apparently been lying
in wait for the men within.
One .man,-" giving ,his - name '>as L. F.
Halswayf 19. years of age, who claims to
have recently,) arriyed .from' Mexico, was
arrested shortly after the shooting by.
Detectives Tom Gibson and Hamill and

RTJSSIAN NOBIX-ITY IN
A BAILKOAD ACCIDENT
STRIKERS and non-union men took
a rest yesterday , on the water
front, and as a result there was
little to show that a mighty strug-
gle between capital and labor was
on along the wharves. Hundreds of people
walked along East street and vainly
sought for something to point out as due
to the struggle that has been In existence
for the last five weeks. /
, There was nothing to be seen, however,
except idle vessels, and -they were idle
only because of its being the Sabbath. The
ships that were tied up at thV wharves
had progressed so far in the -loading and
unloading that the owners felt that there
was no necessity for. working the men on
the weekly rest' day. . ; :
The usual, number of. pickets were on
duty and the police officers were all at
their posts, but they \ had little to do.
There were no nori-union men" on the
wharves for the pickets to work on and
the idle men -kept away from the front
and allowed the police officers to spend a
peaceful day.
The ships that cleared at the Customs
House Saturday sailed yesterday after
noon. The first vessel to leave the harbor
was the Mariposa, which left for Hono
lulu. The big liner was heavily loaded
with freight and carried a large number
of passengers. The collier South Port
land, which completed discharging Sat
urday night, got away for Tacoma, where
sne will take on another cargo of fuel.
The Oregonian, heavily laden with freight
for the Eastern coast, pulled up anchor
yesterday morning and started on her
long voyage. The collier Titania, which
has been discharging at Rosenfeld's bunk
ers if or the last two weeks, left the harbor
at 5 o'clock for the northern coast for
another cargo of coal. The Santa Rosa
got away on time on her trip to southern
ports. She carried a full cargo and a
large passenger list.
There were only a few cases treated at
the Harbor Hospital. William Gallagher
and John Williams, both of whom are
members of the Sailors' Union, were
brought in from a saloon at the corner of
Folsom and First' streets, suffering from
lacerations and contusions j inflicted by
members of the union who were under
the impression that they were showing
signs of a desire to become "scabs."
Â¦Thomas Golden, a non-union man who
had been working, on the collier Titania,
was severely beaten by a number of union
coal handlers and was treated at the hos
pital for a lacerated scalp. The assault
occured at the corner of Second and Fol
som. streets. .
A. Sbmbra, a striker, was brought into
the hospital from the corner of
and Kearnv streets in a badly battered
up condition. He tried to persuade a num
ber of non-union men that they should
not "scab." They thought differently and
before they got through with Sombra he
came to the conclusion that there was
little opportunity for a missionary, single
handed, to make converts to the cause of
unionism.
fe|BaHEBE was an exciting battle at
SI Second and Brannan streets yes-
I s terday afternoon between a po
ll â¢ liceman and about ten j strikers.
As the result Julius Carr, alias
"Punk" Carr, who has been arrested on
a number of occasions for various of
fenses, is lying in ' the Harbor Hospital
with a bullet in his leg.
Police Officer Callahan learned shortly
after 4 o'clock that a crowd of strikers
were creating a disturbance at Second and
Brannan streets.
He at once repaired to the scene and
started to disperse the crowd. One. of its
members, whose name is said. to be Mc-
Keever, j refused to move on and was
placed under arrest. Scarcely had the of
ficer started â¢: with the prisoner to the
nearest patrol box when the crowd sud
denly attacked him. Callahan 'drew his
club and struck at Carr, who seemed to
be the ringleader. John Hogan and Thom
as Brady, who were with the disturbers,
seeing the officer use his club, drew their
revolvers and tired at Callahan. The latter
promptly returned the fire, hitting Can
in the leg.- Altogether about fifteen shots
were' exchanged.
After emptying their revolvers at the
policeman, Hogan and Brady took to their
heels and soon disappeared. â¢Callahan
seized Carr as he was limping away and
took him to the Harbor Hospital, where
the wound in the leg was dressed.- As
Brady was seen to fall after he had gone
a short distance, Callahan, who is one of
the most trusted men in the department,
believes that he was also struck by a
bullet.
Carr will be formally charged with an
assault to commit murder to-day. Â¦ Â¦ ,
The men who attacked the officer are
well known to the police. Brady and Carr
were only recently arrested, according to
Captain Seymour, for sealing a lot ' of
copper. As the evidence against them
was deemed insufficient they were subse
quently released.
Callahan says thi_t a man named Con
nell, who has a criminal record, was one
of the attacking party. He became fright
ened after the ohicer commenced shooting
and ouickly disappeared.
As soon as the snooting was reported to
Captain Seymour he detailed several of
his men to round up the assailants: They
visited their haunts south of Market
street, but failed to get any trace of them.
Officer Callahan's story' of the battle is
as follows: â¢ Â» .
"I was patrolling my beat on Second
street when I was told that a gang of
men was creating a disturbance on Bran
nan street. I hurried to the. place and
ordered the gang to disperse. After I had
placed McKeever under arrest, Carr, who
is supposed to be a bad man, attempced
to interfere. I promptly drew my club,
and as I did so Carr struck me in the
face with his clenched fist. I struck at him
with my club, whereupon Brady and Ho
gan drew revolvers and proceeded to make
a target of me. I lost no time in getting
out my pistol and returning the fire. Carr
fell, hit by my first shot. \
"I then turned my attention to Brady'
and Hogan, firing five shots at them. Both
Hogan and Brady emptied their revolvers
at me, but strange enough I was not-hit.
McKeever escaped during the- excite
ment." - â¢ -
Callahan was warmly congratulated by
Captain Wittman for his bravery.
Many. Acts of Violence.
J. Clements, who came here from Sac
ramento yesterday, was treated at the
Central Emergency Hospital last night for
lacerations of the face. : Clements was
walking near the corner of Sixth and Har
rison streets about 10 o'clock when he
was set upon by a number of men who
were hanging about the corner.
John Foran. who resides at j 15 Ritch
street, had a bullet extracted jfrom his
left hand last night at the Central Hos
pital. He, claims that the wound was
caused by the accidental discharge of a
revolver which he was cleaning. After
the wound was dressed he was taken to
the City Prison where a charge of carry
ing concealed weapons was placed against
him. Foran is a striker.
James Tracey, a striker, was arrested
last night at the corner of Third and
Market streets on a charge of disturb
ing the peace. He attacked a man named
E. Squires, who arrived here recently
from Paso Robles. Squires was also ar
rested. Both men were taken to the
Emergency - Hospital to have numerous
contusions dressed before being locked
up.
William Schuell was treated at the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital early yesterday
morning for several lacerated -and con
tused wounds of the head and body. He
claimed that he had also been robbed of a
purse containing $66. Schuell says that
he was Â¦ walking along Harrison street
when he was approached by five men
who ' told him they were teamsters and
volunteered to show him the location of
the Teamsters' headquarters. He went
with them to , the corner of Rltch and
Harrison streets, and there they attacked
him. They struck him with a club and
knocked him down and then rifled hiB
pockets.
W. H.'Rlley, a non-union teamster, was
assaulted by a number of strikers last
night at the corner of Steuart and Mis*
sion streets and beaten .so badly that at
the Harbor Hospital it was found neces
sary to put a half dozen stitches in his
scalp. Riley resides in Oakland and was
on his way to the ferry when the assault
occurred.
SMALL outbreak* and two rather serldnii conflicts disturbed tlie serenity of yesterday in the
"danflree' district," but othervrlse the day, passed by with as little ' in the way of excitement as
if industrial . peace were being - enjoyed. : Employers made little effort to have work done,,con
tent to. let tlie usual Sunday inactivity "relgfii an tlie water, front aÂ» well Â«s In tlie wholesale
district. A small-sized fleet of vessels put to sea, well loaded with freight.
The greatest labor demonstration in the city's history will be made to-day, and the labor leaders
have devoted much time and thoui?li.t7to .planning 'carefully "its details and guarding: against . any
possible conflict between strikers and the police anthorttieo or non-union men. The parade, starting
at 11 o'clock, will be followed by literary exercises in the afternoon at Mechanic's' Pavilion and a
