Jheir Use and Abuse.
Copyright, 1901. by Doubleday. Page * Co. >
WHEN a general distribution of
halos takes place," once said a
bright woman, "the head of the
willing and unsung martyr,
. .known as a chaperon, will be
found crowned, too, I am persuaded,
among the world's elect."
Not many of us will be found worthy
to wear one of greater radiance. If cheer
. fulness, an absolute disregard of self, in
genuity in Improvising pleasures in which
she takes but an observer's part, and an
unwearied amiability that keeps her
. sweet, smiling and wakeful until her
young charge has* had her fill of pleasure,
be any qualification for such a reward.
The post Is no sinecure, and Its duties are
often a thankless, unenviable task.
Of course, the natural chaperon of a
girl Is her own mother, whose Interest in
all that in any way concerns her child
makes the position an easy one and all
her labor of love; but one whose presence
is imposed to "play propriety" where no
such necessity Is recognized, naturally
feels the embarrassment of beingÂ«t>nwei â¢
come. It Is therefore but fair that her
position should be understood and denned.
The Need of Chaperons.
In Europe, and In those parts of Amer
" ica which have felt the Influence of Old
World customs, the first demand of pol
ished society is that young girls shall bo
properly chaperoned. It Is considered one
of. the elegances of life, one of the graces
pf the best society and an evidence of
the tender respect with which young wo
manhood la regarded; such a formality
being held to safeguard it from all chance
of evil or the appearance of It. -
The world has grown too through
th^e closer Intercourse of its civilized peo
ples, for any to escape its Inherited tradi
tions and prejudices.
Time was when we were so provincial
and inconspicuous that we could make
our own social laws, and we were proud
of the freedom that could exist between
our young women and their men acquain
tances, and protested against the duenna
system as a reflection upon their trust
worthiness.
Strong In their innate sense of propriety,
their moral dignity, discretion and mod
esty, the girls felt quite competent to
take care of themselves, and the young
men relented the suggestion of a chape
ron as an insult to their honor. From
their mental attitude, their self-respect
ing standpoint and the customs of their
environment, they were justified, and
there are not wanting many yet to hold
these opinions.
To such I would say that chaperonagc
is a representative thing. It typifies the
sheltering care, the Jealous protection, of
something very precious. It sets a higher
value upen the object by protecting and
hedging it round In the eyes of others,
and particularly in those of young men
who are apt to sigh for the fruit t.iat
hangs highest.
The Value of a Chaperon.
There Is no doubt, also, that the pres
ence of a chaperon greatly Improves the
manners of the young people.
There are girls who are Inherently well
bred, but who, having the natural, In
stinctive desire to please, sometimes fear
to be considered prim, proper and "good)
goody," If they do not Join In the pranks
and Imitate the . manners of those who
seem to be overmuch at their ease in
young men's society. To such the pres
ence of a chaperon la never an unwel
come restraint.
A loud laugh, familiar manners, urire
strained attitudes, are not attractive; and
Â¦In the freedom of .the club men (llhcumh
these mutters, and those who fancy that
such recommend them are field cheap.
A vivacious girl, with the high spirits
of youth and its Ignorance of the world
and its ways, has sometimes been mis
understood and placed in Â false position,
which the presence of a chaperon would
have averted.
Many a girl would give the world to
efface memories of .Indiscretions of con
duct that bring a blush when recall* d.

A girl Ih Hometimcs Kind to Intrench
herself behind the bulwarks that society
has reared about her, to defend herself
from unwelcome devotion or attentions.
' The Proper Chaperon.
A chaperon should .be an example, to
her young charges In the conventions,
and all social questions should be refer
red to her. She should therefore be em
phatically a gentlewoman, knowing the
usages of polite society; her reputation,
nt course, above question.
A European father who had lost hid
.wife would never place a young unmar
ried daughter at the head of Ills house
without a resident chaperon, and the im
propriety of doing so Is now acknowl
edged with us. '
Thers are not wanting. in this country
of thu'.i'clnl ups and downo, ladles who
are qualified in every way for such a po
sition. Such a one should be treated by
every one in the household as though she
were the social equal ami entitled to the
same deference as the lady of the house
whom she represents. Then, and only
then, can she do justice to the position
and give to the young girl what she needs.
A Chaperon's Duties.
The chaueron should endeavor to see
that hospitable doors are open to her
charge; that well bred and , agreeable
young men are presented t.i her. and It
Is her responsibility that the girl recipro
cates die attentions that she receives !.â¢Â»
a manner befitting In r position.
Much tact is necessary not to draw the
rein too tightly. A leading strap would
be the better figure; that leaves the
young subject free, but checks readily
when It is rieecswary. A chaperon must
be careful never to antagonize her charge
or appear to watch her. She should re
spect i he privacy of her letters, and never
take the opportunity to rebuke or con
demn when a confidence Is given. Indeed,
hi only chance of success Is to win the
girl's real respect and affection, and then
encourage confidence in order to be able
to a< t for her good and advantage and
never from personal motives or curiosity.
It Is her duty, however, to reprove her
choice If she Is careless in her demeanor
with young men. All invitations to men
should be given in the name of the moth
er or chaperon.
In traveling through Europe young
girls may go almost' anywhere under
proper chaperonagcâ to theaters, operas,
tstudlos and Into society. Only when In
trenched within the dignlncu position of
a worker can v young woman dispense
with the demand of etiquette for a chape
ion.
A young man regardful of the proprie
ties never askÂ» a girl to accompany him
to any place of amusement without either
extending the invitation to her mother or
Chaperon, or asking nome married woman
of suitable age and position to accompany
them.
Under exceptional circumstances a
young brother has sometimes he.en al
lowed to fill the position of duenna, prob
ably because of a boy's wall known repu
tation of allowing nothing to escape his
observation, and reticent not bell a
conspicuous characteristic.

bo very hard at Itrst, but with practice
you can soon rise with case. You should
do this at least ten or twenty times night

inu hundred times. Some time you will
learn to rise with an extra weight on your
chest.
The next exercise is performed In this
way. Stand straight, . feet close together,
weight on balls of feet, then twist body
around to the right as far back as pos

Clothes, swell clothes, and lots of

The first thing to think about U
art opera wrap. This yea.c they look good

The most elaborate Is by far the most

from the ranks of the undesirable as well
as the object lonabks, and beguiling the

The strips of gold embroidery upon the
robes of this Indian, prince are set with
many emeralds of a smaller size. The
epaulets, which hang from the shoulders
down over the arms, are incrusted with
extraordinarily large stones surrounded
with pearls.
.The collarâ or one might at most call It
capeâ worn by the Rajah of Baroda is a
muss of diamonds and various precious
stones, combined in rich and wonderful
confusion. The color and brilliancy of
this ornament can better be imagined
than described. The lighter stones are

those forming a a fringe around the lower
edge being of immense size and value.
Scarcely less beautiful is the tassel of

in this tassel represents a fortune. In
each the pearls have been carefully grad

pompon of silk. The cap of jewels which

but self should always be secondary to
the Interest, and pleasure of the young
people. There are those, however, who
put forth efforts ot attract admiration or.
attention to themselves. Such chaperon
ago Is an injustice to the girl.
If a chaperon bo not old enough to be
the mother of her charge, she should at
least have such dignity of character as
to suggest maturity, and so leave no
doubt of the conventions being satisfied.
It Is bad form to send several guy girls
to a bull with a very young chaperon,
perhaps one of their own number who
has Just been married. Such matronizing
is Â« farce, a burlesque and no real chape

Upon coaching parties to races, football
mutches, visits to country clubs, picnics,
studio teas", boating parties, or any fes
tivity where merriment and gay spirits
may tempt the overstepping of the bounds
of strictly good breeding, the matron of
the party should be carefully chosen. I

All the obligation is not on tho one side,
however.

Particularly odd and effective is the
use to which the Rajah of Punnah has
put the thousand's of pearls gathered by
generations of his ancestors. He has
used them, to embroider his robes of state.
Over the shoulders, down the sleeves and
around the edges of the robe the peaj-19
have been woven with silk and gold into
beautiful and intricate designs.
On the turban, from an ornament of
gold and pearls, drop four double strings
of pearls, each graded in size to form a

surrounded with pearls. The necklace is

The Century
Plant
in Bloom.
MANY people who see the enormous leaves and long
shooting flower of the commonly called "Century
Plant" gaze at it with astonishment and not a little
awe and pass it by. They do not know that this plant
blooms but once in fifteen or twenty years, and that that
once means its death.
A few only know the exterior and interior wonders of
the "Agave Americana Variegata."
Up in the Arizona gardens of Golden Gate Park, by
the conservatories, they stand like sentinels, their lofty
heads gazing down in disdain on the ignorants of earth
"The Agave," derived from "Aganos," signifying ad
mirable, referring to the stately form in which some of
them flower, is a native of Northern Mexico, where the
sandy soil and general atmosphere are most beneficial to it.
This plant flowers in from fifteen to twenty years in
this climate, but in the colder climes, owing as much,
however, to the car? taken of them and the repotting, they
have taken as long as forty and fifty years, and gardeners
despaired of ever seeing them flower, and named them
"The Century Plant
In the park to-day there are about twenty different
varieties, in all stages of existence.
The plant has its peculiarities and one desperate fault.
As the flower begins to shoot forth it is *sad to learn
that it steals the life from the large, fleshy, tufted leaves,
and on attaining perfection and the very height of its glory
it commences to droop and gradually dies.
There is fortunately a saving clause, however.
Before death, at^.he very root, spring little suckers or *
baby "Agaves," which are taken from the base of the
leaves.
Golden Gate
Park's
Curiosity
Each of these suckers has a small root, which when
placed in the ground begins at once to shoot and grow.
The, plants are different in sizes and colors, some of
the leaves being yellow and green, some a solid dark
green, as for instance "The Agave Shawii," a giant stand
ing thirty feet from the ground, with a depth of ten feet
and a girth of forty feet.
Others again are more delicate and van-colored.
"The Agave Densiflora," a very rare one, close flow
ered, of a greenish yellow, burst forth last year in a beau
tiful bloom.
The seeds of the rarer ones are hard to get, most of
them coming from Paris.
These wonderful plants thrive in the sandy soil, with
out irrigation, and facing the harshest sea winds, grow up
in all their beauty, and, as Mr. McLaren, the superintend
ent of the park, says, are "a most accommodating plant."
"The Agave Americana" was caught in the height of
its bloom by the camera of Mr. Charles Weidner, and is
shown on this page. It Â»s extensively cultivated in Mexico,
under the name of "Maguey." and is put to many uses.
The Mexican Government offers a bonus to any one
who will plant "The Agave' in certain regions ot Mexico,
and is amply repaid by the revenue derived on the duty re
ceived from the various products of the plant on arriving
at maturity.10

enter her nc.ghuor'a room and inn.*; the

him. When the baby had drowned his
Â«orrowK In the milk bowl, he was tucked
into his little bed to sleep until his wan
dering mother should come home to him.
Later in the evening the household was
awakened by the persistent cries of a
downright angry child. The little fellow
had discovered that he wan alone again,
and promptly resented his neglect.
Just why his mother hadn't come home
did not bother the baby's friend. Of
course she had been detained, and was
probably nearly crazy with anxiety. Fort
unately he would be cared for until her
return. Â«
The next day and the next went by and
the days lengthened into weeks, and still
nothing was heard of George or Salina'
Earnest, the baby's parents. Slowly but
gradually it dawned upon the people in
the house that "baby" >had been nothing
more or less than heartlessly abandoned.
Luckily Richard had fallen into good
hands, and Eleanor Miller was only too
glad to take the little fellow to her heart
and Rive him the most of her miserable
best. If fate does not take a hand In
things and stir the broth the wrong way,
sometimes the local authorities do. A
policeman reported the pitiful story to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children* and they promptly decided that
the child must go to them to be disposed
of as they considered nt. And the why
of all thin was that Mr. Miller, Richard's
foster-father, was a confirmed drunkard,
and his name had not quite the standing
that it might have had.

and since that time no one has ever seen

neither the bank nor the money can be

Hut where is that somewhere? That Ik
the question. To all queries is given the

If anybody can solve the riddle one small
boy's life will be made richer and may be
turned into an entirely different channel.
As it is, Richard Miller Id an object of
charity. Not one cent is paid for his
maintenance In any shape or form.
Yet his life ls>no different from any
other boy of his age. He rises and has
a good, substantial brenkfast. In order to
keep him out of mischief from half after
7 until school time light duties are given
him to perform. From 9 until S he at
tends public school and afterward plays
as hard as any youngster of 11 possibly
c:m, until dinner time. And then it's
night.
Money or no money, mother or no moth
er, what difference does it make?
Just this much. The Child has always
been called a surly mischief makor.
Twice for the want of something better
to do he has run away from the home and
taken two younger boys with him.
He was king of the sand pile and never
did a more despotic ruler exist.
And it was all because he didn't car*
for anybody and nobody cared for him.
There was a vague something that he
missed, but he couldn't make out Just
what it was.
The matron and president resolved to
try a little strategy on their parts. They
wondered if affection wouldn't win tht
day. Mrs. Berti, the president, says it
is a decided success. "The child has
changed wonderfully. He has lost his sul
len air and is always willing and glad to
be of any use. He is our trusted man of
the house and I don't know how we can
get along without him." For that is Just
what they are going to do soon. Twice
a home has been offered him. The first
promised work and not much home, but
tho second one offered just what they dis
covered was neededâ some one to care for
him.
Dick Is not the least bit discouraged and
is quite willing to try his luck again with
another foster-parent. And he does not
mind in the least changing his name with
his residence if necessary. If such should
be the case it will make the fourth time,
and no wonder he asks, "What's In a
name?"
There isn't a single chick or child in
the home who hasn't a strange history if
one would take the trouble to look it up.
The other night the bell rang about 10
o'clock and when the nurse answered the
door she heard some one running away
and a paper bag was lying on the rug.
"Why, said she. "I knew what It was
without looking, and I called the matron
and started for the kitchen and hot water
just as fast as I could. The baby was
nearly frozen, for a paper bag and &
few old rags are not warranted to keep
any one warm. But she is all right now
and gaining rapidly."
So Is it a wonder that the home Is filled
with stories? After a warm debate the
ladies decided to keep the little one, for
although the home Is not for foundlings,
in this case they felt It would be cruel not
to make an exception. So she- was chris
tened Ruth, and that name will aurflca
until she goes into the world to battle for
herself. Then if she needs another it
probably will be Home.
The plan of naming the childrep after
the home is not a half bad one. And so
when Johnny Home and Nellie Home and
all the rest of the large Home family five
that as their name, they can honestly
claim it as their very own.
To keep such an institution going- costs
ever so much money. The dues that are
paid monthly by the ladies are not nearlr
enough to keep it running smoothly, but
the State gives them so much a year, and
strangers assist them now and then,
then.

to do is to weed over Johnnies and Jane's

ERNEST SETON-THOMPSON'S
"LIVES OF THE HUNTED,"
IT Is hardly possible that any one who
reads at all has not made the ac
quaintance of Ernest Seton-Thompson
Through his charming animal stories.
If such there be let him delay no
longer, but go right out and get "Wild
Animals I Have Known.' and then "Trail
of the Sandhill Stag." and then the "Biog
raphy at a. Grizzly." and then this latest of
Mr. Seton-Thompson's books that has
just been brought out by Charles Scrlb
ner's "Live* of the Hunted."
"Lives of the Hunted" contains, as Its
author says, "a true account of the doings
of five quadrupeds and three birds." In
rubject matter, treatment, form and gen
eral make-up It Is very similar to "Wild
Animals I Have Known' âeven more fully
Illustrated, for there are more than 200
drawings done as only Mr. Seton-Thotnp- '
son can do animal pictures
Mr. Seton-Thompson ha* always re
ceived due credit for the full-c*re illus
trations of his books, but for the marginal
sketches a hazy idea has arisen that pos
sibly they were done by Mrs Seton-
Thompson: or at least It was known that
Mrs. Seton-Thompson had something- to
do with her husband's books, but what It
was has never been exactly stated. This
is explained in the preface of the present
volume:
"The public has not fully understood the
part that Grace Gallatln Seton-Thompson
does in my work. The stories are written
by myself, and all the pictures, Including
the marginals, are my own handiwork,
but In choice of subject to illustrate, In
ide&s of its treatment, In the technical
book-making and the preliminary designs
for cover and title page, and in the liter
ary revision of the text her assistance has
been essential."
Aside from their literary value as good
stories well written, all of Mr. Seton-
Thompson's tales deserve credit for work
which they undoubtedly accomplish In a
â¢rood cause stopping the extermination of
harmless wild animals. He says:
"I have tried to stop the stupid and bru
tal work of destruction by an appealâ
to reason that has failed hithertoâ but to
sympathy, and especially the sympathies
of the coining generation."
His stories oertainly do appeal to the
sympathies very strongly. After you read
"Chlr.k" you will find yourself can-vine
- "-ackers in your pockets for free distribu
tion among every band of little yellow
pups that you chance to meet.
"Chink" is this kind of a dog, the regu
lation type of just "dog" that is so well
known.
Every passing wagon and horseman
and grazing Calf had to be chivvied, and
" the Cat from the guardhouse, strayed
by Chink felt that It was a solemn duty
he owed to the soldiers, the Cat and him
self to chase her home at frightful speed
He would dash twenty times a day after
an old hat that Bill used deliberately to
r hrow info a Wasp's nest with the order
'Fetch It!'
"It took time, but countless disasters
'"â¢ran to tell. Chink slowly realized that
'here were, long whips and big, fierce
Dogs with wagtins: that Horses have
teeth in their heels: that Calves have rel
atives with clubs on their heads: that a
fl^w Cat may turn out a skunk, and that

an uncommonly long time, but It all told

ntri when they were gone he could shoot

They become so much accustomed to

by a ruse Scotty manages to lay the great
ram low and has at last in his possession
tbomt magnificent horns that he had ex

nbsolutely to part with them. The strain

thÂ« ram is after him grows stronger from

thÂ» old i.vr.it.r in the final climax of his
story tm sufficient to reform the most
heedless of those who slay merely for
records.

"Johnny Bear" IS simply fine The
humor is delicious. This story i:- the re-
Eult of some, heart-to-heart interviews
the author had with the bears in Yelluw
tone Park.
All the animals there are protected by
the Government. No gun* are allowed In
the reservation and consequently the wild
creatures become quite tame. Near the
Fountain Hotel Is quite a dense forest,
the home of many bears. These beam
make a free lunch counter of the garbage
pi It from the hotel; so to make a clone
i-iudy of the beasts Mr Seton-Thompson
dug a pit In the garbage pile and hid
tncre that he might get picture* and a
clotcr acquaintance with bruin. This cer
tainly ehowa the enthusiasm of the true
lover naturalist. Parenthetically, wo
mufct compliment Mr. Beton-Thompson on
hi* hardihoodâ not Â«so much In risking dis
covery, but in sacrificing *c-lf for science
against that strong combination of flics',
warm weather and garbage.
Johnny, himself, is the delightful but
rather impossible gon of Grumpy. He is
a dyepeptic baa a mangy coat and onÂ«
bad log, and spends most of his time In
*rf-Ttin?r bis mother into trouble. One of
Johnny's funniest escapades Is when he
,-.*>\* a whin! of plum Jam from the kitchen
window. It Is too good to miss, so here
It Is in full:
t '.ri' heard the story from three r.ronÂ«d
nu.-vtttÂ«iu<Â«re. As they were very M-naii:
at.oi-1 'Â¦.wine th-lr word doubted, and very
â¢Mjwi snot* with UÂ»e revolver. 1 believed ever/
word they told me, especially when afterward
Indorsed by the park authorities.
It seemed that of all the tinned goods on the
pile the nearest to Johnny's taste were marked
with a large purple plum. This conclusion he
had airived at only after most exhaustive
study. The very odor of those plums In
Johnny's nostrils was tho equivalent of
ecstacy. So when it came about one day that
the cook of the hotel baked a huge batch of
plum tarts the telltale wind took the story
afar Into the woods, whore It was wafted by
way of Johnny' 6 nostrils to his very soul.
Of course, Johnny was whimpering at the
time. His mother was busy "washing his
face and combing his h.lr, " so he had doubla
cause for whimpering. But the smell of the
tarts thrilled him. He jumped up, and when
his mother tried to hold him he squalled, and
I am afraid he bit her. Site should have cuKed
him, but 6he did not. Php only gave a dis
approving growl and followed to see that hÂ«
came to no harm.
With his Mule black noae In the wind,
Johnny led straight for" the kitchen. He took
the precaution, however, of climbing from
time to time to the very top of a pine treu
lookout to take an observation, while Grumpy
stayed below
Thus they came close to the kitchen, and
there. In the la*t tree, Johnny's courage as a
leader gave out, so he remained aloft and ex
pressed his hankering for tarts In a. woe-begon?
wall.
It is not likely that Grumpy knew exactly
what her son was crying for. But It is sure
that aa soon as she showed an inclination to
go back Into the pines Johnny protested in
such an outraareoua and heartrending screech-
Ing that his mother simply could not leave
htm, and he show%d no signs of coming down
to bÂ« led away.
Grumpy herself was fond of plum Jam. The
odor was now, of course, very strong and pro
portionately alluring, so Grumpy followed it
somewhat cautiously up to the kitchen door.
There was nothing surprising about this.
The rule of "live and let live" Is *o strictly
enforced in the park that the Bears often come
to the kitchen door for Dlckings, and on get
ting something they go quetly back to the

that attractive magazine was sonring in
flights of fancy under the able editorship
of Mr. Burgess. OWiers of theae poem*

Mr. Burgess' name has become ho asso
ciated with nonsense stuff, with the bl
tarre and with freakish literature that
many do not know of the. really fine seri
ous work that he can do. Here is a lit
tle gem of twelve lines:
CHILDHOOD.
Fair Â¦â¢ a star, rare as a star,
The Joys of the future lie
To the eye* of a child, to the nigh* of a child,
. Heavenly far and high'
Fair Â»â¢ a -dream, rare an a dream.
The hop** of a future sure
To the wondering child, to the blundering child
Trusting, and free, and pure'
Fair Is the soul, rare is the soul
Who has kept, after youth Is past.
All the art of the child, all the heart of the child
Holding his faith at last'

so honest, and so entirely the opposite
of anything grotesque. Yet they are hlÂ«,

And to smirch the work of the blessed few.
Who feed on the fancy they try to kill.

This In the teeth of the mouths that whine:
What have ye wrought ye ran nay this' to:

Merer a book that was writ co 111,
Never a picture so false of hue.
Never a '.one with so little thrill.

"Willy and the Lady," from a. popular
standpoint, in the best thine in the book,'
each have gotten the tart but that a new fac
tor appeared In the caac. That week tha hotel
people had brought a new Cat from the Eaat.
She was not much more than a kitten, but
mil had a litter of her own, and at the mo
ment that Grumpy reached the door the Cat
and her family were sunning themselves on
the top step. Pussy opened her eyes to see
this huge, shaggy monster towering above her.
The Cat had never before seen a Bearâ she
had not been there lonn enough; she did not
even know what a Bear was. She knew what
a Dog was. and here waa a bigger, more awful
bobtalled black dog than she had ever dreamed
of coming right at her. Her rtrst thought was
to fly for her life. But her next was for the
kittens. She must take care of them. She
must at least cover their retreat. So. like a
brave little mother, she braced herself on that
doorstep, and spreading her back, her flaws,
her tall and everything she had to spread, she
screamed out at that Bear an unmistakable
crder to
STOP!
The language must have been "Cat," but th-Â»
meaning was clear to the Bear, for those who
Raw tt maintain stoutly that Grumpy not only
Hopped, but Â»he also contormed to the cus
tom of the country and in token of surrender
held un her hands.
Hiwever, the position she thus took madn
her so high and the Cat seemed tiny in the
distance below. Old Grumpy had faced a
Grizzly once, and was she now to be held up
by a miserable little sptke-tatled skunk no
Mpger than a mouthful? She was ashamed of
herself, especially when a wail from Johnny
smote on her ear and reminded her of her
plain duty, as well as supplied his usual moral
support.
So she dropped down on her front feet to
proceed-
Again tha Cat shrieked, "Stop!"
But Grumpy Ignored the command. A
scared mew from a kitten nerved the Cat, anfl
the launched her ultimatum, which ultimatum
was heraelf. Eighteen sharp claws, a mouth
ful of keert teeth, had Pussy, and Â«he worked
them all with a desperate will when she land

When I say popular, however, I should
add In the way of "masculine popularity,"
for It may be that the fair sex will take

"The Kangaroo Rat" Is a study In

charm of execution are concerned.
"Tito" Is a' strong story of "The Coyote

in the book and I regret that lack of space
prevents giving it more attention. The
main point of the story lies In the out

experience learned the lessons of dogs,

the general reader some of the forms of
activity that are being manifested In the
Interests of social reform. It Is believed
that extending the knowledge of the
manifesting of, this uncial spirit will
greatly enlarge, the activity toward social
progress. The titles of a few of the chap
ters will Indicate the character of the
book: "Better Houses for the People."
"Public Health." "Good Roads and Com
munication." "What Good Employers
Are Doing." "Organization of Wage
Earners." "Economic Co-operation of the
Community." "Political Reforms," "Char
ity and Correction" and "The Social
Spirit In Conflict with Anti-Social Insti
tutions." ' â¢ , â¢",". ' .
The author's studies In this special field
have given him a wide acquaintance with
present conditions, and his knowledge of
reform movements enables him to write
with Intelligence and fairness.
"The concrete methods here described
arc not Imaginative Inventions of the au
thor, but ways by which earnest men and
women have actually achieved success.
No attempt has been made to produce
an exhaustive encyclopedia of social re
forms, but only to illustrate a tendency
and encourage individual workers and as
sociations.
"Many people of generous nnd patriotic
sympathies eager to advocate goodness,
truth and beauty arc discouraged from
undertaking large enterprises and cosmic
schemes by their vastness, remoteness
and complexity. Show them a way from
their own door which leads straight to a
task which is not beyond their resources
of knowledge, time and money, and they
cheerfully follow It to a definite duty, and
return to their 'homes with satisfaction
of heart and conscience." ' ,
The hook will be found an excellent
manual for social and study clubs and
will be equally interesting and valuable
for the general reader. It Is fully indexed
and contains a well selected bibliography
to each chapter. . (Published by Scott,

Great Masters of Painting.
"Among the Great Masters of Paint
ing" la an Interesting volume from the
pen of Walter Rowlands. Works on the
history of art are very numerous, and
also, for the most part, exceedingly dull.
Mr. Rowlands, however, has succeeded in
the rare task of writing a book which Is
not only Instructive but also readable,
fresh and exhilarating. We are not given
a catalogue of the names of painters and
canvases, but are seated In the studios
of the great masters of art and behold
the Immortal works of the Imagination
in the process of making. Thus we be
come in fancy the Â¦ contemporaries of
Rubens and Titian and Velasques, as well
as of Hogarth and Reynolds and a score
of other painters represented In this work.
This is In many respects an exquisite and
valuable giftbook. To have Illustrated tho

- Parliamentary Practice.
The publication "' a second edition of
Rufus Waples* "Handbook on Parlia
mentary Practice" has afforded the au
thor an opportunity to revise the original
work and to enlarre It by the addition of
matter which criticism' of the original
work showed to be necessary. The revi
sion and addition*, however, do not ma
terially alter the treatment of the theme.
In hip preface to the Fecund edition the
nuthor has had the satisfaction of beine
able to say: "Eighteen year* have passed
sine* this book was first published. Dur
ing that time there ha* been a hnriM cor
respondence on the BublecÂ»lk o ' it ami many
questions have been asked and answered:
yet no one has pointed out any error in
the book. Some: explanation?, however,
seem advisable and some additional mat
ter desirable. This book now Introduces
the subject* more gradually than It did
before, presenting first- the elementary
principles. A new chapter Is added cover
ing several topics and attempting to cor
rect some misleading notions." The aim
of the work is to reduce the whole code
of parliamentary practice 'to a system*
readily comprehended so that any ques
tion which arisen may be solved on prin
ciple,. It undertakes no Innovations upon
established usages and has no other ob
ject than that of enabling n learner to ac
quire a knowledge of the rules a and
methods by which parliamentary work is
carried on. As the Â¦ aUthor himself â¢ ex
pressfs It: "So. novelty In the law and
usages of deliberative bodies is Introduced
or attempted: on the contrary the merit
claimed Is that of rendering rules of order
plain, certain and readily applied." (Pub

Fine Ridge Plantation.
The hero nf "Pine Ridge Plantation."
by William Drysdale. Is an underpaid and
oVerworked farm drudge, who Is not con
tent to work aimlessly from day to day,
hut who sets out to make his own living.
He purchases a piece of cheap land In
the South and through persistent efforts
converts it Into a prosperous cotton
plantation. The evolution of the
"patch" into the plantation Is consist
ently worked out by the author, and the
story !s brimful of life and earnest en
oeavor. Its purpose is to show how "lib
erty and living" may be secured without
lapital. and how Independence of char
acter is bound to succeed in the end.
But the book in never a series of s.ige
rules or models by which the ownei of
Pine Ridge Plantation succeeded. It Is
simply the picture of a sturdy, energetic
American boy and his sister, who had
more than one laughable experience In
their first days of unguided effort, but
who learned something from each epi
sode â just as any intelligent, ambitious
boy should learn from a perusal of (his
practical, entertaining story. (Published

God Save the King.
A new story Is out by Ronald Mac Do

earlier than its predecessor. Like the
former story, the present one is autobio
graphical In form: but it is the hero this
time, not tho heroine, who tells it, and
who figures an tho chief actor in the
thrilting events described. This young
royalist befriends, at a critical moment,
the defeated and wandering Charles 11,
before the King's escape to the Continent
after the battle of Worcester. The hero
lne aids him in this adventure, and she
and he and the restored monarch are 'the
principal actors in an exciting episidc that
furnishes the climax of the story. (Puu

novel and it will be published within a

presented a most interesting picture of

of thrilling adventure and dramatic epi

John Lockwood Kipling is an accom
plished artist. Those who knew him
in India remember the time when Rua
yard Kipling, though creating a consid
erable local reputation In his short stories,
was best known as the son of a famous
father. Mr. Kipling senior was for a
generation one of the central figures Â«)
around whom the artistic education of the
native population flourished. Under his
guidance the sons of the best families
were instructed in painting, modeling,
sculpture and woodworking, and In his
schools were students ranging from tod
dling boys of tenderest years to men of
thirty and upward.
After ten years at Bombay he accepted
the appointment of principal of the La
hore School of Art. where ne was also
curator of the museum. It is said by one
who knew him and hia contemporaries
that Mr. Kipling, senior, was the most
proficient Oriental scholar among Euro
pean residents. He had a marvelous
knowledge of the- dialects of India. Added
to this he was one of the chief authorities
on antiquarian subjects there and was
wont to be appealed to from all parts of
India for his judgment upon any Interest
ing "finds" of doubtful origin. Such a
treasure-store of strange and beautiful
things his house was as to be the envy
and despair of every antiquary of his ac
quaintance.
Lockwood Kipling, who was born at
Pickering, showed keen artistic tendencies
from his earliest years. After leaving
school he went into the potteries, where
he carried oft the Wedgwood Memorial
Art Prize. Subsequently he studied at
South Kensington, and his services on tha>
teaching staff led to his being sent by the \
Government to Bombay to direct art in
struction there. His work would have
sufficed to make the name of Kipling- fa
mous even had there not been the brilliant
Rudyard to add luster to it. All the Klp-
Ungrs are clever, and the head of the fam
ily is as many sided and gifted a man as
need be sought. He has a taste for liter
ature himself and has written a valuable
work. "Man and Beast in India."

IT has been discovered that the
best way to get a new complexion
is to 'get' a new one. This isn't
the axiom that it sounds. We
have been in the habit of thinking
that we renewed our skins by rubbing
them, or stemming then, or oiling
them, c: enameling them. By no
means, says modern science. The way
to get a new complexion is to take off
the old one.
A very neat idea, don't you think

For it must be. remembered that wrin

tension and becoming relaxed, or in other
words, tv the skin getting too large for
the face. It will reÂ«.cily appear that eon
6iant pulling pinching, rubbing and roll
ing the skin will on;y stretch it more. As
th* skin is subject to the same mechan
ical laws as other fabrics. It relaxes with*
time and improper usage.
Rubbing the face vigorously with a
towel after washing stimulates the cir
culation and brings a healthy glow to
the tkin, to be sure, but it does more.
It brings fine wrinkles too. How? Sim
ply by retching the kin. a little at a
time. The act of rubbing the face with
a towel 365 times a year has caused many
a woman unconsciously to cultivate a big
crop of wrinkles, and she innocently Â»on
ders why she is prematurely old. >
The best treatment for the permanent
eradication of wrinkles Is the mask treat
ment, although the old reliable surgical
method Is more suitable in cases where
tberc is great sagging about the cheeks
and throat. Both methods are old and
have stood the test of time and experi
*nc?; neither method is common because
eaca requires the skill and training of a
physician to be successful.
Tiiis is the method of the mask treat
ment:
First, my patient dons a kimono, and
rot until fluffs and curls are pushed back
is she ready to undergo the treatment.
I notice whether the is blonde or bru
nette, and I ascertain her physical condi
tion. This may cause some flight var.ia
i tion In my treatment.
In the beginning the skin is thoroughly
cleansed with soap and water: then it is
sterilized with an antiseptic solution.
Following this Is a gentle electric treat
ment, after which the first mask is ap
plied.
It is put on in email sections until the
#.-hose face is encased in a snugly fitting'
whitr; mask. The materials composing
this mask consist of chemicals which,
when brought into intimate contact with
th* epidermis, cause it gradually to sep
arate from the true skin. This process
takes forty-eight hours. It causes no
pain.
At the end of th" time the mask is re
moved and the old *kin is found to be ad
hering to it. The "nd or the tighten

several separate layers, â¢ seta layer l>*>itiÂ«

the atmosphere is duaty and full of soot,
find soap necessary to cleanliness, and
they* may use it sparingly once a dayâ
usually Just before going to bed. Urns
some good, pure soap, being very careful
to pat the face thoroughly dry. Thos-j
who cannot tire soap successfully may
try oatmeal. Put It in a cheesecloth bag
and wet It thoroughly before applying. It
is very cleansing and takes the place of
soap better than anything else. ' â¢ <

JL "Or to dinner." substituted Lorry,
end they returned 10 the Regenpets. ThÂ«
dining hall was spacious and beautiful, a
mixture of the Oriental and medieval.
It rapidly tilled.
"Who the dickens can all these people
be? They look well." Anguish whispered,
as if he feared their nearest neighbors
might understand his English.
"They are unquestionably of the class
In which we must expect to find the Gug
pcnslockers."
Before the meal was over the two
strangers saw that they were attracting
a great deal of attention from the other
cuests of the house. The women, as well
as the men, were eying them and com
menting quite freely, it was easy to see.
These two handsome, smooth-faced youn^r
Americans were as men from another
world, so utterly unlike their companions
were they in oersonal appearance. They
were taller, broader and more powerfully
built than the swarthy-faced men about
them, and it' was no wonder that the
Wpmen allowed rdmiration to gleam in
their eyes. Tov.ard the end of the dinner
several officers came in. a"-d the Ameri
cans took particular pains to study them.
They were cleanly built fellows, about
medium height, wiry and active. As a
class â¢he men appeared to average five
feet seven inches in height, feme a little
taller, some a little shorter. The two
strangers were over fix feet tall, broad
ehouldered and athletic. They looked like
gipnts among these Graustark men.
"They're not very big. but they* look as
if they'd be nafty in a scrap." observed
Anguish, unconsciously throwing out his
chest.
"Strong as wildcats. I'll wager. The
women are perfect, though. Have you
ever seen a smarter set of women. Har
ry T"
"Never, never! A paradise of pretty
women. I believe I'll take out naturali
sation papers." '
When the two strangers left the dining-
T-jcra they were conscious that every eye
in the place was upon them. They drew
themrelves to their full height and strode
between the tables toward the door, feel
ing that as th;y were on exhibition they
ought to appear to the best advantage.
During the evening they heard frequent
Ellutions to "the Americans," but could
not understand what was said. The hotel
men were more than obsequious: the mil
itary men and citizens were exceedingly
deferential; the women who strolled on
the plaza or in the great garden back of
the hotel were discreetly curious.
"We seem to be the whole show here,
Gren." Kaid Anguish as they sat down at
one of the tables In the garden.
"I guess Americans axe rare."
"I've found one fellow who can speak
German and French, and not one except
our guard who can talk English. That
cierk talks German fairly well. I never
heard such a language as thes*: other peo-
I <- use. Say, old man. we'd better make
inquiry about our friends to-night. Tnat
clerk probably won't be on duty to-mor
row."
"We'll ask him before we go to bed."
asrreed Lorry, and upon leaving the bril
liantly lighted garden they sought mine
host and asked him if he could tell them
where Caspar Guggenslocker livtd. He
looked politely Incredulous and thought
ful, and then, with profound regret, as
sured them that he had never heard the
name. He said he had lived in Edelweiss
all his life and knew everybody of conse
quence in the town
"Surely there must be some people
here." cried Lorry, almost appealingly.
He felt disheartened and cheated. An
guish was biting his lips.
'Oh. possibly among the poorer
classes. If I were you, sir. I
ehould call on Captain Dangloss,
the Chief of Police. He knows every
soul m Edelweiss. lam positive I have
never beard the name. You will find the
captain at the tower to-morrow morning."
The two Americans went to bed. one
so dismayed by his disappointment that
he could not sleep for hours.
VII-THE LADY IN THE CARRIAGE.
They elept rather late in the mornlnj?,
first because they were very much fa
tigued after their long Journey, second for
thÂ»- reason that they had been unable to
woo slumber until long past midnight. An
guish Etretched himself lazily in bed when
he heard Lorry's voice from the adjoining
room.
' J suppose we are to consult the police
1n oro>r to get a clew to your charmer,"
h*. yawned. "Nice friends you pick up on
i all way Journeys. I'd be ashamed."
Well. Harry, I'll confess I'm disgusted.
This hae been the most idiotic thing I've
SJSJT <lone. and if you say the word we'll
get MM Ih-PS in the first trainâ freight or
passenger. The Ouggenslockersâ pigs "
Mr Lorry was savage.
â¢ Hs4 a. bit of it, my boy, not a bit of
it We'll make a house-to-house canvass
it Iks psssÃS fall us. Cheer up, cheer up!"
You go to thunder!"
i n Ijont talk like that, or I'll
k on you in a minute. I'm here be
noose to be, and I've more heart
.n th' '!hase at thie minute than you have.
lv Mt loet hope We'll find the Guggen-
Sascksn tf we have to hire detectives to
irnce em from the Unttfcd States to their
very doorstep. We're going to see the
jiolift after brÂ»"kfast."
Afu-r breakfast they did go to see the
Baron I^angloss. After some inquiry they
found the gloomy, foreboding prison, and
Mr. Anguish boldly pounded on the huge
gates. A little shutter flew open, and a
mar. s face appeared. Evidently he asked
what was wanted, but he mlKht as well
have demanded their live*, bo far were
they from understanding his query.
Bmn Danglose?" asked Anguish,
promptly. The man asked something else,
but aE the Americans Hhook their heads
d'-precatingly, he withdrew his face an.l
presently swung open the. gates. They en
tered and he closed the doors behind them,
locking them in. Then he directed thf-m
ecross the court to an open door In the
aged mass of gray stone. As they strode
away from the guard Lorry created con
tion by demanding:
"How are we to talk to the chief If he
doesn't understand us or we him? We
should have brought an Interpreter."
"I forgot about the confounded lan
ruage. But if he's real he can talk Irish."
Lorry told tjim he wasn't funny.
"is this his excellency. Baron Dan
G. B. McCUTCHEON
gloss?" asked Anguish, stepping Into a"
small room and stopping suddenly in the
presence of the short, fierce man they had
seen the day before- The American spoke
in French.
"It is. gentlemen. Of what service can
I he to Messieurs Lorry and Anguish?"/
responded the' grim little chief, politely
rising from beside his desk. The visitors
looked at one another in surprise.
"If he knows our names on such short
notice, he'll certainly know the Guggen
slockers," said Anguish to his friend, in
English.
"Ah. ton are looking for some one
named Guggenslocker?" asked the chtel.
smiling broadly nnd speaking excellent
English. "You must not be surprised, gen
tlemen. I speak many languages. I heard
last night that you were inquiring about
one- Caspar Gujjgensloeker, and I have,
racked my brain, searched my books,
questioned my officers, and I am sorry to
inform you that there Is no such person
In Kdelwciss." ;.
"I was so well assured of it, Baron Dan-
Closs," Lorry said.
"The name Is totally unknown to me,
sir. May 1 ask why you are searching
for him?'*
â¢'Certainly. â¢ I met Mr. Guggenslocker,
his wife *ir.d his niece last spring In the
United States. They Invited me to come
and see them if 1 ever happened to be In
this part of the world. As my friend and
1 were near here 1 undertook to avail
myself of 'their invitation."
"And they said they lived In Edelweiss.
Graustark?"
"They did, and I'll humbly confess I did
not know much of the principality of
Graustark."
"That is certainly complimentary, but,
then, we are a little out of the beaten
path, so you are pardonable. I was at
first under the impression that you were
American detectives with extradition
papers for criminals bearing the name
you mention."
"Oh!" gasped Anguish. "We couldn't
find ourselves If we should be separated,
captain."
The grizzly bearded . captain laughed
lightly with them, ami then asked Lorry
it he would object to giving him the full
story of his acquaintanceship with th->
alleged Graustiirkiatis. The beviWeu-U
and disheartened American promptly loss
all he knew about them, o:n.tting certain
Under details, of course. At .Â¦>Â¦ proceeded
the Chitf crew more and mote interested,
and, mlmlu at last Lorry came to :hÂ«
Assets] of thy strange trio, he gave
a sudden start, exposed a queer little
smile for a second or so and then was as
spbinxUke as tefore. The ever vigilant
Anguish observed the involuntary start
and smile, quick as the Chief had been
to recover himself, and felt v thrill of
triumph. To his anger and impatience,
however, the old omÂ«_-er calmly shook his
head at the end of the narrative and ati
nounced that he was as much in the dark
as ever.
"Well, we'll search awhile for our
selves." declared'Arigulsh, stubbornly, not
at all satisfied.
"You will be wasting your time." said
the Cr.lef, meaningly.
"We plenty to waste." retorted the
other.
After a few moments they departed.
Baron Danglosfe accompanying them to
the gate and assuring them that he and
his men always woutd be at their com
mand, Ills nation admired the American
people, he warmly declared.
"That old codger knows our people. and
I'll btt a thousand on it," said Harry,
angrily, when they had gone some tittle
distance down the street. Then he told of
the queer exposure Dangloss had unwit
tingly made. Lorry, more excited than he
cared to show, agreed that there wax
something very suspicious about this new
discovery.
They walked about the quaint town for
an hour or two. examining the building.'.
the people and the soldiery with deep
Interest. From the head of the main
street. Castle Avenue, they could plainly
tee the royal palace, nearly a mile away.
Its towers and turrets, gray and gaunt,
ran up among the green treetops and
were outlined plainly against the yellow
hills. Countless houses studded the steep
mountain slope, and many people wetÂ«
discerned walking and riding along the
narrow, ledgelike streets which ' wound
toward the summit, far up In the clouds.
Clearly and distinctly could be seen the
grim monastery, perched at the very
pinnacle of the mountain, several miles
away. Up there it looked bleak and cold
and uninviting, in great contrast to the
loveliness and warmth of the valley,
ijown below the grass was moist and soft,
trees were approaching the stage wherÂ«
yellow and red tints mingled with the
rich green, flowers were blooming, the
land was redolent of the sweet fragrance
of autumn, the atmosphere warm, clear
and invigorating. It was paradise sur
mounted by desolation, drear and deaden
ing.
Wherever the tall, distinguished Ameri
cans walked they formed the center of
observation and were the cause of com
ment that bore unmistakable signs of
admiration. They bowed pleasantly to
many of those who passed them and re
ceived in return gracious and* profound
recognition. Military men saluted courte
ously; the women stared modestly and
prettilyâ perhaps covetously; the mer
chants and citizens in general bowed and
smiled a welcome that could not have
been heartier. The strangers remarked
the absence of vehicles on the main
streets. There were pack mules and
horses, human carriersâ both male and
femaleâ during the entire morning
they saw not more than six or eight car
riages. Vehicles were used solely by the
quality and as a means of transportation
for their persons only. Everybody, with
the few exceptions mentioned, walked or
rode, horseback. The two friends were
delighted with the place, and Anguish
advocated a sojourn of several weeks,
even though they did not find the Gug
genslockcrs, his object being to secure
photographs and. sketches of the pictur
esque people and the strange scenery, and
to idle away some hours upon the glit
tering boulevards. Grenfall, since he was
In the project so deeply, was so nearly
reconciled as to be exhilarated by the
plan. They decided to visit the royal
grounds In the afternoon, providing there
was no prohibition, reserving a ride up
the steep for the next day. A policeman
â¢who spoke German fairly well told them
that they could enter the palace park If
they obtained a signed order from the
chief steward, who might be found at any
time in his home near the gates.
They were strolling leisurely toward the
hotel, for the moment forgetting their
quest in this strange, sunny land, when
they espied a carriage, the most conspicu
ous of any they had seen. The white
horses were gayly caparisoned, the driver
and the footman beside him wore rich
uniforms, the vehicle Itself gleamed and
glistened with gold and silver trimmings.
A short distance behind rode two young
soldiers, swords to their shoulders, scab
bards clanking against their stirrups.
Each was attired In the tight red trousers,
shiny boots, close-fitting black coat with
gilt trimmings, and the red cap which the
Americans had noted before because of its
brilliancy. People along the street were
bowing deeply to the occupants, two
ladies.
"Harry! Look!" exclaimed Lorry,
clutching his friend's arm like a vise.
"There in the carriageâ on this side!" His
voice was hoarse and trembling.
"Miss Guggenslocker?" cried An
truleh.
"Yes! Yes!" They had stopped and
Lorry was grasping a garden wall with
one hand. â
i ... ' . ,
"Then It's funny nobody knows the
name here. She seems to be some one of
consequence. Good heaven, t don't blame
you! She's the most "beautifulâ"
By this time the carriage was almost
opposite and within forty feet of 'Where
they stood. The ladles. Miss Guggenslock
er's companion as young and almost as
beautiful as herself, had not observed the
agitated two, but Lorry's face was beam
ing, his hat was off. and he was ready to
spring to the carriage side at a moment's
warning. Then the young girl at the side
of the woman whose beauty had drawn
a man half around the world saw the tall
strangers and called her companion's at
tention to them. Onco more GrcnfaN
Lorry and Miss Gugfipnslorker were look
ing into each other's eyes.
The lady started violently, her eyes
grew wide, her ltp:< parted, and her body
was bent forward eagerly, a little gloved
hand' grasping tho side of the open car
riage. Her "Meal American" was bow
ing low. as was tho tall fellow at his side.
When he looked up agota h's eyes were
glowing, his handsome face was flushed,
and he saw her smile, blush furiously and
incline her head gravely. The carriage
had swept past, but she turned her head,
and he detected an appealing glance in
her eyes, a perplexed wrinkle 'airnw her
brow, both of which were swept away an*
Instant later by the most bewitching of
smiles. Again her head was Inclined, this
timo a trifle more energetically, and then
the maddening face was turned from him.
The equipage rolled onward, and there
was no effort on her part to check Its
progress. The men were left standing
alone and disappointed on the streets of
Edelweiss, the Ã¼bject of their search clip
ping away at< noon as she hnd been found.
Her companion was amazed by the little
scene, it was evident, judging by the
eager look on h<-r fare an she turned with
a question In her eyes.
"Turned down!" exclaimed the Irrepres
sible AnguiÃh. dolefully. "That'tt pretty
shabby treatment, old man. Put nhe'H
quite worth the Journey."
"I'll not go buck to America without
her. Do you hear that, Harry Anguish?"
He was excited and trembling. "But why
didn't she Â»t n\. ."' he went on, dismally.
"Oh. you dear old fool!" said Anguish.
The two ntood looking after the carriage
until It turned Into a side street, half wuy
down the shady stretch, toward thÂ» castle.
They saw her companion glance back, but
could not tell whether she did likewise.
Lorry looked uneasily at Anguish, and the
latter read his thought.
"You aYe wondering about the Guggen
slocker name, eh? I'll tell you what I've
worked out during the past two minutes.
Her name Ik no more Uuggc\>slocker than
mine is. She and the uncle used that
name as a blind. Mark my words, she*
quality over here; that's all there Is about
it. Now, we muHt llnd out Junt who Â«he
really Ih. Hero, comes a smart-looking
soldier chap. Let's a: k him, providing
wt cun muki; him understand."
A young soldier approached, leisurely
twirling a cane, for he was without his
side armn, Angulxh accosted him In
French and then In German. He under
stood the latter and was very polite.
"Who was the young lady In the ear
rlago that Just passed?" asked Lorry,
eagerly.
The face of the soldier flushed and then
grew pale with anger.
"Hold on! I beg pardonl but we are
strangers and don't quite understand your
ways. I can't see anything Improper In
asking such a question," sold Anguish, at
tempting to detain him. The young man
struck his hand from his arm and hits
eyes fairly blazed.
"You must learn our ways. We never
pass comment on a lady. If you do so In
your land, I am sorry for your ladles. I
refuse to be questioned by you. Stand
aside, fellow!"
Anguish stood aside In astonishment,
and they watched the wrathful gallant
strut down the street, his back as stiff as
a board.
"Damned touchy!" growled Anguish,
"You remember what Bltzky said about
their respect for the weaker sex. I guess
we'd better keep off that tack or we'll
hatch up a duel or two. They seem to be
fire-caters. We must content ourselves
with searching out her home and without
assistance, too. I've cooled off a bit, Har
ry, and now that I've seen her I'm will-
Ing to go slowly and deliberately. Let's

take our time and be perfectly cool. I
am beginning to agree with your incog,
proposition. It's all clearing up In my
mind now. We'll go back to the hotel
and get ready for the visit to the palace
grounds."
"Don't you intend to hunt her up? "Gad,
I wouldn't miss a minute If I had a
chance to be with a girl like that! And
the other was no scarecrow. She is rather
a beauty, too. Greatest town for pretty
women I ever struck. Vienna is out of
it entirely."
They strolled on to tho hotel, discussing
the encounter in all its exhilarating de
tails. Scarcely had they seated them
selves on the piazza, after partaking of
a light luncheon, when a man came gal
loping up to the walk In front of tha
hotel. Throwing his bridle reins to a
guard he hastened to the piazza. His at-,
tire was that of a groom and something
about him reminded them of the footman
who tat beside the driver of the carriage
they had seen a short time before. He
came straight to where tho Americans sat
smoking, and bowing low, held before
them an envelope. The address was "Mr.
Grenfall Lorry," but the man was in
doubt as to which was he.
Lorry grasped the envelope, tore It
open, and drew forth a daintily written
note. It read:
1 Â«ujf Dear Mr. Lorry:
"I was surprised very much to see you

senger when he calls for you at S o'clock

charmed to see you again. Will you

"Sophia Guggenslocker." â¢
Lorry could have embraced the messen
ger^ There was a suspicion of breathless
neÂ»s in his voice when he tried to say
calm 1 " to Harry;
"Harry! Look!" exclaimed Lorry,
clutching his friend's arm like a vise
"There in tho carriage â on this side'"
His voice wai hoarse and trembling.
"An Invitation for to-morrow."
"I knew It would come* that way."
"Also wants you to pome."
"Shan't I be in the way?"
"Not at all. my boy. I'll accept for yot:.
After this fellow goes. I'll let you read the
note. I think I'll write antinHwer."
Motioning for tho man to remain, lie
hastened to his room, pulled out some sta
t!onÂ»ry. and feverishly wrote:
"My I>enr Mis* Guggenslocker:

(solemnly shook hands with the recipient.

Vlll-THK ABDI'CTION OF A PRIN
CESS.
That afternoon they went to the palace
grounds and inquired for tho chief-stew
ard. After n few moments they woro
Hhown to his office, in a small dwelling
house Just Insl'le the gates. The steward
was h red-faced little man. pleasant and
accommodating. He tould speak German
-In fact lie whs v German by birthâ and
they had no difficulty in presenting their
request. Mr. Fraaechâ Jacob Fraasch
waÂ» at first dubious, but their frank,
eager faces soon gained for them his con
sent to see that part of the great park
open to the public. Beyond certain lines
they were not to trespass. Anguish aske.l
how they could be expected to distinguish
these lines, being unacquainted, and the
steward grimly informed them that th<;
members of the royal guard would estab
lish the lines so plainly that it would bo
quite clear.
He then wrote for them a pass to the
grounds of the royal palace of Graustark,
affixing his seal. In giving this pass to
them he found occasion to say that tha
Princess had instructed htm to extend
every courtesy possible to an American
citizen. It was then that Anguish asked
If he might be permitted to use bis cam
era. There was an Instant and emphatic
refusal, and they were told that the pass
would be rescinded If they did not leave
the camera outside the gates. Reluctantly
Anguish deposited his luckless box in the
steward's office, and they passed Into the
broad avenue which led toward the pal
ace.
A guard, who served also as a guide,
stepped to their side before they had
taken ten paces. Where he came from
they never knew, so Instantaneous was
his appearance. He remained with them
during the two hours spent in the won
derful'park.
The, palace stood In the northwestern
part of the grounds, possibly a half-milo
from the base of the mountain. Its front
faced the mountain side. The visitor-?
were not permitted to go closer than a
quarter of a mMc from the structure, but
attained a position from which it could
be seen in all M* massive, ancient splen
dor. Anguish, who had studied churches
and old atrucUr.es, painted the castles on
the Rhine and was something oi/a con
noisseur In architecture, was of tne opin
ion' that It had been standing for more
than five hundred years.
It was a vast, medieval mass of stone,
covered with md'ss and ivy. with towers,
turrets and battlements. There had been
a muni In bygone days, but modern ideas
had transformed tho waterway into solid,
level ground. This they learned after
ward. Broad avenues approached In sev
eral directions, the castle standing at tho
far side of a wide circle or parade ground.
The open space before the balconies was
fulfy three hundreds yards square, and
was paved. From each side stretched the
velvety green with its fountains. Its trees,
its arbors, its flowers, its grottos and its
red-legged soldiers.
The park was probably a mile square,
and was surrounded by a. high wall, on
the top of which were little guard-houses
and several masked cannon. In all their
travels the Americans had not Been a
more delightful bit of artllice. and they
wandered about with Â« Â»<>rene content
that would have appealed to any one but
their voiceless guide. He led them about
the place, allowing them to form their
,own conclusions, draw their own Infer
ences and make their own calculations.
His only acts were to salute the guards
who passed and- to present arms when ho
had conducted his charges to the edge of
forbidden territory. When they had com
pleted their tour of Inspection their guide
rapidly led the wny to the wall that en
circled the ground*, reaching It at a point
not far from "the castle itself*-' Here was
KltUHted another large gate, through
which they did not pass. Instead they
ascended some steps and came out upon
the high wall. The top of this wall was
several feet wide, and walking was com
paratively wife. They soon understood
tne guide's design. The object was to
walk nlong this wall until they reached
the main Kate. Why this peculiar course
was to be undertaken they could not
Imagine at first. Anguish's fertile brain
came to the rescue. He saw a number of
women in a distant part of the grounds,
and remembering their guide's haste In
conducting them to the wall rightly
conjectured that It was against custom

I course, were confined to I the native civil,

tocrats was vastly different : The women
were gowned a/ter the latest European
patterns and the men, except those of
thÂ« army, wore clothes almost as smart
as those which covered the Americans.
Miss Guggenslockerâ or whatever her
name might beâ and her carriage compan
ion were as exquisitely gowned as any
women to be seen on the boulevards or in
Hydo Park of an afternoon.
It was late in the afternoon when they
jetumed to the hotel. After dinner, dur
ing which they were again objects of in
terest, they strolled off toward the castle,
smoking their cigars and enjoying the
glorious air. Being a stranger In a
strange land, Lorry acted on the romantic
painter's advice and also stuck a revolver
fn his pocket. He laughed at the sug
gestion that there might be use for the
weapon in such a quiet, model, well-regu
lated town, but Anguish insisted:
"I've seen a lot of these fellows around
town who look like genuine brigands and
cutthroats, and I think it just as well
that wo be prepared." asserted he, posi
tively, and his friend gratitted what he
called a whim.
At 10 o'clock the slender moon dropped
behind the mountain, and the valley,
which had been touched with its tender
light, gradually took on the sombert>ess
und stillness of a starlit night. The
town 3lumbered at 11, and there were
but few lights to be seen -on the streets
or in the houses. Here and there strolled
tho white uniformed police guards; occa
sionally soldiers hurried barracks-ward;
once In a while belated citizens moved
through the dense shadows on the side
walks, but the Americans saw still life
in its reality. Returning from their stroll
beside the ta.stle walls, far to the west
of where they had entered the ground-?
that afternoon, they paused In the mid
dle of Castle avenue, near the main gate,
and looked down the dark, deserted
street. Far away could be seen the faint
glare from their hotel; one or two
street lamps burned in the business part
of the city; aside from these evidences
of life there was nothing but darkness,
silence, peacefulness about them every
where.
"Think of Paris or New Tork at 11
o'clock," said Lorry, a trifle awed by the
solitude of the sleeping city.
"It's as dead as a piece of prairie land"
paid his friend. " 'Gad. it makes me
sleepy to look down that street It's a
m!le to the hotel, too, Lorry. We'd bet
ter move alone."
"Let's He down near the hed^e, smoke
â¢imrther cigar and wait till mldnigbt. It
is too glorious a night to be lost in sleep."
ursed I crry, whose heart was- light over
the joy:? of the day to come. "I can
dream jrst as well here, looking at that
dark old castle with its one little tower
Sight, as I couM if I tried to sleep in a
hard bed down at the hotel."
Anguish, who was more or less of a
dreamer himself, consented, and, after
lighting fresh cigars, they threw them
selves on the soft, dry* grass near the
tall hedge that fenced the avenue a.Â« It
neared the castle grounds. For half an
hcur they talked by tits and starts: long
silences were common, broken only by
brief phrasi s which seemed so to disturb
the one to whom thÂ«y were addressed
that he answered gruffly and not at all
politely. Their cigars, burnt to mere
stubs, were thrown away, and still the
waking dreamers stretched themselves
In the almost impenetrable shade of the
hedge, one thinking of the face he had
seen, the other picturing in his artist eye
the painting he had vowed to create from
the moonlit castle of an hour ago.
"Some one coming," murmured the
painter, half rising to his elbow atten
tively.
"Soldiers," said the other briefly.
"They'll not disturb us."
"They'll not even see us. I should say.
It's as dark as Egypt under this hedge.
They'll pass If we keep quiet."
The figures of two men could be seen
approaching from the city, dim and
ghostly in the semi-blackness of the
night. Like two thieves, the Americans
waited for them to pass. To their ex
ceeding discomfiture, however, the pedes
trians halted directly in front of their
resting place and seated themselves leis
urely upon a broad, flat stone at the road
side. It was too dark to see whether
they were soldiers, notwithstanding the
fact that they were less than fifteen feet
away.
"He should be here at 12," said one of
the newcomers In a low voice and In fair
ly good English. The other merely grunt
ed. There was silence of some duration,
broken by the first speaker.
"X this job fails and you are caught it
will mean years of servitude."
"But In that case we are to have ten
thousand gavvos apiece for each year wÂ«
Us In prison. It's fair payâ not only for
our failure, but for our silence," said the
other, whoso English was more difficult
to understand.
Anguish's fingers gripped Lorry's leg.
but there was no sound from either of
the thoroughly aroused dreamers. "A
plot, as- 1 live." thought each, with a
thrill.
"We must be careful to speak only in
English. There are not twenty people In
Edelweiss who understand it, but the
night has ears. It Is the only safe tongue.
Geddos speaks it well. He should be
herÂ«." It was the first speaker who ut
tered these words, little knowing that he
had listeners other than the man to
whom he spoke.
A dark figure shot across the roadway
and, almost before the Americans were
ay. are of It, the party numbered three.
"Ah, Geddos. you are punctual."
"I have- found It ever a virtue," re
sponded the newcomer.
"Have you secured your men?"
*I have, yourâ"
"Sh! Call me Michael, on your life!
They are ready and willing to undertake
the venture?" â
"Yes, but they do not understand the
true conditions. I have told them that we
are to rob the castle and carry the booty
to Ganlook before morning."
"They do not know the real object of
the raid, then. That Is as I desired. Are
they trusty an<i experienced men?"
"The best â or the worst â that I could
find in Vienna. Not one understands our
language, and they are so Ignorant of our
town that they are entirely dependent on
me. They know nothing whatever of the
Princess, Michael, and will do only as
they are told, realising that If caught
they will be guillotined. I have told them
it Is tho royal palace we are to rifle. Os
trom. here, and I are the only ones, ex
cept yourself and the men who will aid
us Inside the castle, who know the truth,
sir."
"It cannot fall Unless those Inside prove
false or unworthy," said the hoarse
voiced Ostrom.
Anguish's fingers were gripping Lorry's
leg so fiercely, that tha blood was ready
to burst out, but hs did not feel the pain.
Here, then, was some gigantic plot In
which the person of the Princess herself
was to be considered. Was tt an assas
sination?
"You have five of these Viennese?"
"Yes. Two to stand beneath the wtn
dow to receive the booty as we lower It
to the ground, one to stand guard at the
west gate and two to attend the carriage
and horses In the ravine beyond the cas
tle."
"When did these men arrive?"
"This morning. I kept them in my sis
ter's home until an hour ago. They are
now In the ravine awaiting Ostrom and
myself. Are you sure. Michael, that tho
guards and tht cook have been made tJ
understand every detail? ThÂ« faintest slip
will mean ruin."
"They are to be trusted fully. Their
pay !s to be 'Mgh enough to make tt an
object to be infallible. The guard. D.

you will chloroform him â with hhs con

explained before, crawl along In the dark

under these they will hide, protected from

Princess is to be wrapped in the cloth you
take with you and 'cwered from the

remain In hiding until you have left the
castle and have reached their aide. It
will not be difficult, if caution is observed,
for you to get outside of the wall and to
the carriage in the ravine. I have given
you this plan of action often, I know, but
I desire to impress it firmly upon your
minds. There must not be the slightest
deviation. The precision of clock work
is necessary."
The man named Michael hissed the fore
going into the pars of his companions, the
palsied Americans hearing every word,
distinctly. They scarcely breathed, so tr*w'
mendous was the restraint imposed uponT
their nerves. A crime so huge, so daring
as the abduction of a Princess, the ac
tual invasion of a castle to commit the
theft of a human being just as an ordi
nary burglar would steal in and make
way with the contents of a silver closet
was beyond their power ot comprehen
sion.
"We understand fully how it Is to be
done and we shall get her to Ganlook on
time. ' Â«aid GÂ« <i<io*>. confidently.
"Not a hair of her head must be harm
ed."' cautioned the arch conspirator. "In
four days I shall meet you at Ganlook.
You will keep her in close confinement
until you hear from me. Have you the
guard's uniforms that you are to wear to
right?"
'â¢They are with the carriage In the ra
vine; Ostrom and I win don them before
going to thÂ».- castle. In case we are seen
they will throw observers off the track
long enough for us to secure a good start
in our flight. "
"Remember, there is to be no failure.
This may mean death to you: certainly a
long prison term if you are apprehended.
I know it is a daring deed, but it is just
of the kind that succeeds. Who would
dream that mortal man could find the
courage to steal a princess of the realm
from her bed and spirit her away from
under the very noses of her vaunted
guardsmen? It is the bold, the Impossi
ble olan that wins."
"We cannot fail if your men on the in
side do their work well," said Geddos,
repeating what Ostrom had said. "All
depends on their faithfulness."
â¢They will not be-foÂ«nd wanting. Tour
cut-throats must be sent on to Galas with
the empty carriage after you have
reached Ganlook in safety. Tou will
nee.d them no more. Ostrom will pay
them, and they are to leave the country
as quickly as possible. At Calas they will
be able to Join a packtrain that will carry
them to the Great Northern Railroad.
From there they will have no trouble in
reaching Vienna. You will explain to
them, Geddos. All we need them for. as
you know. Is to prove by their mere pres
ence in case of capture that the attempt
was no more than a case of burglary con
ceived by a band ot Viennese robbers.
There will be no danger of capture if you
once get her outside the walls. Tou can
be half way to Ganlook before she is
missed from the castle. Nor can she be
found at Ganlook if you follow the in
structions J gave last night. It la now
nearly 1 o'clock, and In half aa hour the
night will be as dark as Erebus. Go.
men; you have no more time to lose, for
this must be accomplished slowly, care- Â»
fully, deliberately. There must be no *
haste until you are ready for the race to
Ganlook. Go. but for God's sake, do not
harm her! And do not fall!"
"Failure means more to us than to you.
Michael," half whispered the hoars* Os
trom.
"Failure means everything to me! I
must have her!"
Already the two hirelings were moving
off toward the road that ran wast of the
castle grounds. Michael watched them
for a moment and then started swiftly in
the direction of the city. The watchers
had not been able to distinguish the faces
of the conspirators, but they never could
forget the calm, cold vote* of Michael,
with its quaint. Jerky English.
"What shall we do?" whispered An
guish when^the men were out of hearing.
"God knows!" answered Lorry. "This
is the most damnable thing I ever heard
of. Are we dreaming? Did we really see
and hear those men?" He had risen to
his feet, his companion sitting weakly
before him.
"There's no question about tt! It's a
case of abduction, and we have tt In our
power to spoil the whole Job. By Gad,
but this is luck. Gren!" Anguish was
quivering with excitement as he rose to
his feet. "Shall we notify old Daagloss
or alarm the steward? There's no time
to be lost if we want to trap these fel
lows. The chief devil Is bound to escape,
for we can't get him and the others, tno^
and they won't peach on him. Come. wÂ«
must be lively! What are you standing
there for? Damn It. the trap must be
set!"
"Wait. Why not do the whole Job our
selves?"
"Howâ what do you mean?"
"Why should we alarm anybody? We
know the plans as well as these scoun
drels themselves. Why not follow them
right into the castle, capture them red
handed, and then do the alarming? I'm
in for saving the Princess of Graustark
with our own hands and right under the
noses of her vaunted guardsmen, as
Michael says." Larry was thrilled by th*
spirit of adventure. His hand gripped his
friend's arm and his face was close to his
ear. "It is the grandest^ opportunity two
human beings ever had to distinguish
themselves!"
"Great heaven, man! We can't do such
a thing!" gasped Anguish.
"It Is the easiest thing in the world.
Besides, if we fall we have nothing to
lose. If we succeed, see what we've done!
Don't hesitate, old man! Come on! Coma
on! We'll take 'em ourselves, as sure as
fate. Have you no nerve? What kind
of an American are you? This chancy
won't come in ten lifetimes! Good Gof!

MOLLIE DEXTER, the "good
[\ f\ angel" of Alaska, is in town.
y I And she can read her title clear
V * to this appellation, which was
JL first given her by the miners of

She is a little, broad-faced, dark

t.ittooed below her mouth. This "goo<s

When her husband first met her she was

th* earliest pioneers in that frozen region
I* re but few white men had before
iv.rtsed foot.
After some years of work and wander
rigs this white adventurer made his way
:o the Eskimo village where the little
L>k:mo Â¦ 'lie lived, happy in her furs
and diet of raw Hsh and berries, and
xvith net the slightest idea of how much
happier she was going to be made. John
Dexter worked in a mine ocar there
and Mollie worked there for him. It was
hi-.i-d to deal with the Eskimo and make
thtm understand and harder to get
ibern to stay by the work in the mines for
any length of time. So. perhaps in curi
osity Mollie l-vii. to help the man from
a far and strange eustomrl country by
acting as interpreter for him and influenc

ThÂ«re was gossip and "large doings"
and much slaughter of fish when they
later became husband and wife. Perhaps a
good share of the comment was caused by
the fact that the ceremony was performed
by a missionary, which v. as not regarded
as entirely necessary in orthodox Eskimo
unons.
From that date began a new and
strange but happy era in Mo! lie Dexter's
- life.
John Dexter left the work in the mines
and established a fur-trading station a*.
Chignik. in the Golofnin Bay district, on
the route from Dawson to Nome. Her*;
they began- their married life in a^ little
place built of dnftwood, the rough places
filled by sea mow.
Later they built a hotel, for Dexter had
made millions once or twice since hi*
marriage, and only a few years ago was
known at- the "gold king by the Yukon
miners.
But it was in the little house of drift
wood that the big heart of Mollie Dexter
first earned for her the title of "good an
gel." Here they were living, trading
b*-ad3 for furs, when the first news of the
fctrike at Nome beach reached Dawson
and the stampede of the miners for the
â¢ â¢ * diggings commenced. Old and young,
expert and inexperienced, joined in the
chase for the hidden wealth, with terrible
physical results to a large proportion of
the rentoresosM ones.
The Dexter camp was the forced stop
ping place for hundred* who were suffer
re the untold privations and terrible
hardships entailed by the winter Journey
over the ice and snow from the Klondike
to Nome. More than once did this waYm
hearted little Alaska woman open her
door only to find a half-frozen miner ly
ing on the threshold. In no kinder spot
could the cruel elements have thrust him.
.and nowhere could he have been more
tenderly nursed and cared for than at the
hands of this little dark-skinned woman
and her husband. " Every miner through
out Alaska knows something of John
Dexter, and most of them have reason to
tpeak In thankful praise of his womanly
wife.
It was no uncommon thing for the little
house of driftwood to have as many an
seventy-five half-frozen, belated miner*
sleeping on the tables or In any other
place that could po&slbly be foifnd for
them. Once, when John Dexter was away,
Mollie hersVlf rescued two men from tho
graap of the mow and the unconscious
sleep that Is" the forerunner of beln<j
frozen to death. Out with her dog tÂ«am
and sledge. she found them, and one at a
time, wrapped In part of her own furs.
the dragged them on the sledge and drove
them to the waimth and good cheer of
the home that never refused a shelter and
care to any one.
Many a miner who stopped at the Dex
ter camp after a long struggle made
while in no way properly equipped for
the trip, as so many of these gold peak.
Â«..rs failed to be, will remember the home
of Mollie Dexter as the place where he
was warmed and fed and cared for pa
tiently, and sent on his way with a fresh
lack of provisions. Lindblura, the man
who ran away from a whaling ship and
made his way to Nome to find one of
the biggest paying claims of the strike,
was a visitor at the home of the Dex
'Â«-rs when fortune had not found him. \
If a miner was sick as the result of
Mi exposure! and hardships or too utter
ly exhausted to continue the journey at
once, he was tenderly nursed and taken
care of by this little Dsklmo woman, un
til he was thoroughly recuperated, and
able to go on his way. And there were
cf ten Quite a number of these * unfortu
nates who left the Dexter home with
thankfulness and blessings on Its occu
pants in their hearts. â¢ "H'i'ii : "
No wonder that Molly. Dexter should be
regarded by so many Alaskan miners
THE GOOD ANGEL OF ALASKA
with a feeling akin to reverence. She
did all these "Mac*, aided and abetted
by her husband, from a heart full of love
and charity toward humankind, and
gave services worth more than their
weight in gold at such a time in such a
country where no one know* anything for
or against any newcomer, and what Is
done In kindnrss must be done in the
broad spirit that mark? the brotherhood
cf man. For these poor and suffering
men she sewed; she gave away her furs
ans provisions; she ministered to them
with kindly hands; and for it all Mollie
Dexter uld never receive a i>enny in
payment. Surely the nature of the little
Eskimo teaches a lesson to many.
Later the Dexter* moved into a hotel
built by Mr Dexter, and now being op
erated by a company. This hotel was ul
ways a glad milestone when reached by
miners on the way from Dawsun to
Nome. Mr. Dexter moved to Nome In its
earliest days and wan fortunate in the
selections of claims that paid from the
beginning, and are now promising much
greater values.
Fortune ha* given him many ups and
downs of late years, and ho iÂ» not BOW

though still a man of means, which the
rich claims at Nome bid fair to largely
increase ami to restore him to his oki
days of fortune again. Many of the un
fortunate among the population of the
new camp at Nome will also remember
the name of Dexter with feelings of
warm gratitude, as none there were per
mitted to want for food or shelter while.
Mollie Dexter and her husband could

brought out by her Influence many of the
good and lovable points in their charac

There were many things to take up the

not the least of which must have been
the somewhat irksome task of Introducing

When she spoke to me it was with a

sent a caressing look toward the mass of

to call her, was thinking of. her own trou

15no_textno_textTHE PASSING OF PICTURESQUE CHINA
TOWN AS VIEWED BY THE ARTISTS.
fy HINATOWX Is passing.
I I San Francisco's Chinatown, the
\Y") talked of, the written about, the
j^ visitedâ it is passing.
Perhaps you don't see it. That
all depends upon what kind of an eye ycu
axe looking with.
If it be a financial eye, of course you
don't gee it. Business was never better,
say the merchants up Dupont street.
Tourists come and go, faster and thicker
year after year. c The country Is prosper
ous and there Is money enough afloat to
reach the rare old lacquers and porce
lains and ivories that bring the righteous
and the unrighteous profit.
If It be the eye of the statistician, you
don't see it. Population within those
dozen blocks is on the rapid increase, you
Gay. Where once a few pioneer Chinese
huddled, now there are thriving families
rearing plenty of small fry to fill the tene
ments even fuller.
Ah. but if it be the eye artistic! Then
you know only too well that there Is no
longer In our midst a little, crowded
treasure trove of Oriental colors that
blend to harmony, of shaky walls and
rotting structures that beg to be trans
ferred to canvas. The artists have been
robbed- of their treasure, they say, and
the robbery was committed by a Board.
Many men and women who are famil
iar with every nook and corner and all the
devious ways of Chinatown stroll through
the narrow streets these days and glance
about regretfully, as they note a change
In some doorway; the absence of some
awning, or the addition of some modern
device.
They are the people who look for lights
and shadows, color eft>cts, types of hu
manitythey are tile artists to whom
Chinatown has brought much of happiness
and no little measure of fame. It Is through
their achievements that the place Is des
tined to lire for years and years after the
city will have razed the present quarter.
It is from their viewpoint the deat% war
rant of Chinatown was signed when some
men, collectively known as a Board, be
gan to buy whitewash, and it la their Chi
natown that Is Flipping into the waste
that past days make.
Who would choose to paint a flooring
of macadam? Who could see anything pic
turesque in a- wall which stares one out
of countenance with its unblinking white
sees?
Not an artist, purely.
It used to be that not a day passed but
the congested alleyways, the obscure
courts and even the traveled main streets
Â¦were dotted with easels. Even though it
rained there was always some typical,
slant-eyed creature ready to pose. Art
% students by the score found it inspiring
to be working beside painters whose work
was already spreading the fame of China
town. Now on the sunniest days one may
loiter about through the streets, in th*
chops, anywhere, and find no sign of a
pencil or brush. Pretty Chinese children
play about the doorways. Curious figures
silently shuffle in and out the passage
ways, but the artists who knew them
Fhave departed, apparently for all time.
Why? Because everything that used, to
be charming to them Is rapidly being
- spoiled.
The very atmosphere, I they complain,
which formerly was to them redolent of '
Orientalism, qualntnesn â "old - world

FROM AN ARTISTS STAND
POINT CHINATOWN IS EACH
YEAR BECOMING MORE
IMPOSSIBLE.
i? T is very true that from an artist's
f standpoint Chinatown is each year
Â« becoming more and more impossi
ble. There used to be a certain de
light in working there, right in the
heart of San Francisco, and yet as
far removed from the bustle and gar
rishncss cf the modern oity as
though one had sailed over seas. Most
of that charm is lost, for with every
attempt to Americanize the place,
with the idea of producing order and
;ompelling cleanliness, the old Orien
tal atmosphere is dissipated.
I have always felt that had China
town flourished in or near any of the
great art centers of the world it would
have been made famous for all tixua
by brush and pencil.
I never go there now â there is noth
ing to attract one. Much that was
ence so picturesque has either been
covered over with whitewash or is De
ing repaired and put in order for a
coat of whitewash to-morrow.
T. WORES.

ARE MAKING PICTURESQUE
POSSIBILITIES BUT A
MEMORY.

THERE is doubt that the China
town of artists will soon be but a

The walls are being whitewashed, the
passageways ere being lighted with
electricity, everything that used to
have charm is being transformed in
color and picturesque possibilities.

of present-day art. ' It was not so n

Of course it was never a pleasant

the way the Chinese had of scram

artist would rather have it so thÂ«n
as it is. Now that it is being made
c'.^an there will soon b3 nothing to
paint.

Far how could any one with artistic
cravings satisfy them in a room where i
every object strtmls fully revealed in the |
radiance of an incandescent lamp. Time
was when that rame room was tilled with
shadows and with a soft light falling fit
fully hire anfl then from a wonderfully
wrought, incense burning lamp. Then it
was that artists were at work.
It used to be that chimnrvs were un
known in the precincts of the soft-step
ping Chinese, and^when at successive
hours during the ifay one Celestial after
another would come to cook his little
meal of rice und pork, there was always
a palÂ» blue haze from burnin,? wood and
charcoal, to soften the color of a flaunt
ing canopy. The curling blue smoke is
carried away In flumes now, and gaudy
splashes of red and green and yellow
flare distractingly on jme's vision.

one little Uen where less than a year ajco

Smoke-stained rafters that were delight
fully suggestive of age and primitive liv
ing have been painted white.
Out on the streetsâ even down Fish al
ley, but more conspicuously in some of
the wider avenuesâ evidence can be found
of the passing.
It was a good many years ago that
Amedee Joullin painted Fish alley. He
found it full of color, of rickety balco
nies and flapping awnings in varying
shades. Into oamboo baskets were gath
ered bright-colored paper scraps. The
baskets have disappeared and a cart daily
gathers all such refuse from receptacles
less antique and more practical.
No wonder that Joullin Is one of those
to say that Chinatown has had Its day.
A stroll through the crooked byways is
to him like meeting an old friend in whom
some sad change has taken place. Joullin
of late has been painting Indians, but his
Chinatown pictures are among his best.
In the days when Wores painted In Chi
natownâ Ft was Theodore Wores who back'
Jn the early eighties "discovered" Its pos
sibilities, although Jules Tavernler had
worked there beforeâ ln desultory fashion,
Wores painted the pictures that brought
him many shekels from people like
Earl Rosebery, Sir Thomas Hesketh
and Mrs. Hopkins Searles and Introduced
Ban Francisco's Chinatown to the art
connoisseurs of New York, Boston and
London, there was not a vestige of white
wash, not a thought of renovation. He
was looked upon by the people he painted
a something of an Interloper. The story
is still told how, In order to get the In
terior of a Josshouse, he became a paid
up subscriber to the society. The piece
of red paper on which his name Is in
scribed In odd hieroglyphics may be seen
any day posted on the wall of the Sacra
mento-street josshouse In company with
the names of hundreds of Chinese pa
trons. That slip of paper Is an undis
turbed memorial of the five years Wores
spent among the Chinese. Perhaps more
.than any other, he has pictured their lives
and customs, and a comparison of his
paintings with the streets and interiors as
seen to-day will quickly reveal In the dif
ference of scene and color the mutability
of art subjects.
The old Palace Hotel and the Royal,
which once teemed with color and where
in each room could be found material for
a characteristic sketch, have the past
year or so become as commonplace as the
most practical Board of Health man
could wish.
On every street some ornate little bal
cony, beloved by wielders of the brush,
has been removed or painted over. Lean
ing walls have been straightened and
loose boards on the older buildings have
been nailed down. On the roofs odd ef
fects secured from a vista in which
clothcspoles and ledges filled with boom
ing plants were deliciously mingled are
seldom found now. There will be still
other departures. One man who used to
paint there declared the other day that
the inhabitants themselves are coming to
lack something that at one time made
them excellent subjects for studies. Per
haps they, too, are yielding to the pres
sure of civilization, and while learning
the use of English and soap they may be

to keep the inquisitive Celestials from
hanging on his shoulders and his easel.
They probably would glance at him from
a distance unconcernedly.
Peixotto sketched in Chinatown last
year, but he did not attempt color, a sig
nificant fact. It is said that he will have
the distinction of being the last of the
artists of any note to seek themes in Chi
natown. Even the students, those who
send broadcast calendars and Christmas
cards, are looking elsewhere for studies,
for. like the painters 'in oil and the many
who have done exquisite things in water
color and pencil, they feel the change that
has gradually been transforming the lo- Â¦

1: the very middle of the center of Paris Emma
Calve, the great prima donna of the Maurice Grau
Opera Company, has a charming apartment,'acces
sible and prettily furnished in a Parisian sort of
ei-aj as to color and divans, with five Buddhas of as
many sizes and materials, to emphasize the Oriental
suggestion.
Although brought up as a most devout Catholic in
Mid- France, she is occult, esoteric. Buddhistic and su
perstitious to a degree. She consults fortune tellers,
is heneli something of a medium, believes in reincar
nation, and ; egards .death as but a change of existence.
Somebody has said: "You never think of any one
eiie when Calve is on the stage." It is the same in
a room. Every one seems tame and commonplace, and
Xt every one else.
It it not only that she is* very handsome, but that
her type and her personality are so pronounced.
She is a typical gypsy, and her proper draperies are
shawls and kerchiefs, sashes, big earrings, bangles and
a rag or two. No matter how elegantly she is dressed
tins picture forms a double about her that cannot be
- -Ken off.
As if in confirmation of this idea, her favorite posi-
on, and that into which she drops with a little chuckle
ci relief the moment the door is shut on the last of
her grand guests," is that of crouching on the floor
in front of a wood fire, which by choice she has burn
in g^ on the hearth instead of in a grate.
Ah, now for comfort," she cries, dropping down
with that mobile grace of a young savage, her bare
arms crossed over her knees, indolent content envelop
ing her whole attitude, the firelight painting Murillo
â¢ ? hes over the rugged mass of dense black hair tum
bling about her round cheeks, the flesh tints of face,
arms and the large white throat, the dark glints of
eyes half closed, the marked brows, the full, red lips,
the sweet, womanly chin and the black and gilt fram
ing of her dress. Oh, how I wish I had something to
rcast!" she says, poking the embers with a little branch.
' How I love to roast raw things in a fire!"
No one would ever mistake the picture for that
of a Fifth avenue belle. Anything more like a "Bo
kemian" never breathed.
She lives alone here with her maid, "Jenny," a pious,
Alsatian maid, who regards the Buddhas and fetiches
ci her mistress with eyes askance, the sign of the cross
and an appeal to a saint.
With her company manners on, Calve is a strange
mixture of child and woman, now surprising by well
turned phrases and ideas that are forceful, true and
original; again dropping into the most childlike ex
pressions. Fitful and moody, she can pay the most
concentrated attention if the subject or person inter
ests her. She passes from one thing and one person
t j another more with the air of a good-natured child
that is being amused than of a lady who is entertaining
her guests.
At "her table the same peculiarities prevail. A nat
ural grace and a real good-natured desire* to have peo
ple served and comfortable govern her manner much
more than the trained attentiveness to her guests which
btlongs to the conventional society lady. Cordial, frank.
ti?i!y diverted, young-spirited, easy-going, she seems
able to neglect any one, or to say or do anything
rhrupt or harsh. You have the feeling that if she felt
like it. no social laws would prevent her from doing
or saying, or not doing or saying, anything that she
wished.
Her choicest toy is an Edison phonograph, which
was the first thing she bought in America. She is
never tired cf listening to it. singing and talking into
ir. znd having her friends try their voices. She is so
excited and interested to find that no one can recog
rize his own voice, but that all can recognize the voices
of others. She finds, too, that all local faults are ex
pgerated. She has obtained many hints from her
phonograph. She understands the practical make-up
of the machine, just how the "wheels go round." and
why anything if the matter. She has many celebrated
voices caged in her musical box.
What does she talk and think about? Oh. well,
rverything and anything that is suggested, with a strong
undercurrent toward the stage. Not talk about her
self and acting, but about plays and characters and ac
tors. She can tell a good story with both tears and
laughter Â¦ it. and she seeks suggestion and help in
her work. Just row she is much concerned as to the
manner of being Ophelia mad.
The conventional Ophelia she finds flat and insipid
in its endless and unbroken plaintiveness, which does
not seem to her according to nature. She says no mat
ter how sweet and gentle persons may be, lunacy
changes the character and makes them do the very op
posite of the natural bent. The most modest and timid
are apt to be all that is opposite, and the most gentle
are subject to fits of frantic violence.
In Milan %he visited the lunatic asylum in pursuit
of this idea, and paid special attention to the young
jrirls crazed by love affairs. She found her theory to
be universally carried out in fact. Now she wants to
vary the Ophelia representation by those sudden and
unlooked for outbursts, but is afraid of shocking the
connoisseurs, who often hold much more by tradition
than by Â£ruth.
Speaking of these unhappy girls, the tears came to
Gtlve's eyes, as she remarked that all of them were
rocking dolls or making the motion of rocking babies
in their arms. She did not know whether it was the
memory of childhood that was alive or the maternal
instinct feeling for such subjects, as some years ago
-he herself passed through a very fierce love experience,
the marks of which will bear on her temperament
through lite.
She asserts very gravely that she will never ma-ry.
As to a married woman being on the stage, she has
itrong and very straight ideas. "Never, never on earth,"
she says, "should a woman show such disrespect to
her husband as going upon the stage while his wife.
Jl hurts his name, offends him in all his tastes, preju
dices and feelings. It makes him an object of ridicule,
whether he feels it or not. If rich, why should he per
mit his wife to gain her own money? If poor, so much
the worse. She is on the stage subjecting herself to
all sorts of possibilities to make money for him to live
by. Bah! Disgusting, impossible! I could not play
:i married. Besides, a woman who loves aright cannot
give the necessary attention to a stage life.
Then there are the jealousies which abound â jeal
orsy of stage attentions,* jealousy of each other's gifts,
: both arc on the stage," and she laughs and makes
ail I2uch heartily at the memory of the poor tenor who
for eight months actually restrained his voice one half
so as not to outshine his jealous soprano wife. After*
tlist time, however, he began to see the selfishness of
his partner; he sang out, swept the glory and granted
the divorce.
One delightful trait about Calve, she never bores her
J:ftcners with her triumphs, public or social. Such a
â¢rcliri as this is!
Speaking of the immense revenue which she receives
and is to receive for engagements for the coming years,
Calve remarks upon the pity of it coming so late.
"Ah. the pity of it," the says, in her expressive way;
"the pity that success comes so late. I never dreamed
of so much money. When twenty-one, two or three,
one-third of it would have been royalty. Oh, what
plans and projects I made for when I should be rich!
Now there are many things I do not want or cannot
have."
Calve is very generous with her money. She is at
present supporting wholly some eight or ten persons,
snme of them families. She is very kind to her parents!
She spends two weeks with them now before making
the Spanish tour. She gives much in charity also, and
l:rr name appears in the fund books of toe Blind Asylum
hi Paris. â¢
Another praiseworthy trait of this Carmen is her grat
itude for service or love rendered. The people who
were kind to her when poor, the nurse who was de

voted to her when sick, her maid, her managerâ she is
never too hurried or engaged to say a kind word or do
a good turn for any of them, ami she would just as
soon have them in her parlors as the most titled people.
Her singing teacher, Mme. Rosina Laborde of Paris,
is the special object of her veneration. She has taken
lessons of her some ten years, and still studies roles
under her direction. Her attachment to this lady, who
was herself a great prima donna, is very touching.
Calve loves cats. She finds them the most independ
ent and coquettish of created things and .full of occult
influence. She docs not care for jewelry. She is fond
of a slender bracelet with heart locket attached, tur
quoise on one side, diamond on the other. She wears
little, tiny combs about the width of postage stamps
in her shaggy hair. No one knows what for, and the
wonder is they do not fall out. ' She wears no rings at
present; her hands are plump, with very pointed finger
tips, a type that has been characterized as "idle hands"
by some writer. Wild verbena is her perfume, the car
nation her flower, autumn her season.
She laughs much that people are deceived in the size
of her hands when on the stage, where they really do
look quite small. She shows how she "manipulates"
them. A certain suppleness saves her from being a very
ki>ge woman; she has an illusive way throughout; and
she has a limping sort of walk that is fascinating. The
esoteric people tell her that she was a lover of Rem
brandt in another creation and that she was very cruel
to him. These people coaxed her to stop eating meat.
"I trembledâ l could not sing. A singer must have
meat."
She has a great horror of being stifled, or of being <
held or restrained in any way; the idea of hands being
held over her ears or mouth is terrible. Being drowned
i<; to her the most horrible of deaths. On the ocean she
bees into fits when she reflects that there is "nothing
but water" all around. The thought of the cold, the
wet, the depth, the creatures at the bottomâ eternity
there â ugh !
"Give me fire, give me heat, give me flames, burn me
up; but oh, the waves!"
It is needless to say that she insists on cremation in
stead of burial. If buried, she wants to be in Spain,
where "they put people into little houses and leave
the doors open."
She likes Spain; it is so cheap down there, and
everything so easy, and the sky so clear. She likes it
better than Italy. They do not like "Carmen" down
there, she says. They tell her no Spanish woman could
act like that. But' then Carmen was not Spanish; she
was Bohemian, just what Calve is. She is more tired
after Carmen than after any other role, and says it is a
constant tension.
Managers keep her playing Carmen because it is so
profitable, but she has s dozen other roles at command,
some of which she infinitely prefers. For example,
Santuzza, in "Cavalleria Rusticana," and Ophelia, which
are her favorite roles. She is frightened and nervous
until she begins to play.
She likes the climate of America very much, much
better than that of England, where sunless skies give
her the blues. She cannot speak a word of English,
however, which she mourns, as she cannot, without a
language, get a just estimate of individual intelligence.
It was by chance â which, properly spelled, mean 3
Providence â that Emma Calve became an opera
singer. Her parents, who lived in Spain, near Madrid,
at the time she was born, shortly afterward returned to
.France, to a village called Aveyron. Emma, a sweet
and beautiful child, was not thought to possess especial
musical talent. When twelve years of age she was sent
to a musical school at Auriac.
One day, about three years later, a famous musician
from Paris happened to visit the school. While inspect
ing the chapel he heard Calve sing. He was captivated
by her sweet voice and childish grace. He saw the pos
sibility of a great singer. He talked with her and her
mother about a musical career. As the result of this
enthusiastic encouragement she abandoned the convent
school, going at once to Paris to study music The
stage seemed to offer the largest opportunity. From
the critical period of her first debut until she became a
star of international renown Calve relates in her own
inimitable way the story of her failures and triumphs.
She says:
"I shrank from the idea of going upon the lyric stage,
but temperament was too strong for me. I was 16 then.
I studied first with Mme. Laborde and then with Mme.
Marchesi. Oh, how I pined for freedom! I, who lived
among the mountains, shut up like a caged bird in the
wails of a city. I thought I should die, but I did not.
and by and by I ceased to beat my wings. Then came
my debut at the Theatre de la Monnaie, in Brussels, in
ittz
'".Marguerite, in 'Faust,' was my first role, and I fol
lowed it with Cherubine in 'The Marriage of Figaro.'
I succeeded, and was engaged by Victor Maurel to cre
ate* the part of Bianca in an opera called 'Aben Harriet."
at the Theatre Italiens. in Paris. I also sang with Maurel
in 'Zampa,' at the Opera Comique. My voice was bril
liant, they said, but I could not act. I was cold and stiff
and immature â I had not learned to get beyond myself
in my acting. I was 19 by this time, and I became
dreadfully ill. I went back to the mountains to be
healed and to learn to live. I had succeeded as a singer,
it is true, bat had failed as an actress, and I learned the
meaning of pain â pain in mind and heart and body.
"Slowly, in that dreadful time, my soul awoke. I ma
tured. From the child I became a woman. Then I
read Balzac, and he opened to me the great book
'Humanity.' In his pages I learned to read the secret ot
human souls, the hidden motives of action. Balzac had
influenced me greatly, and I was seized with a passion of
new knowledge, the desire to help others, to make the
world better and happier. That condition, the. longing
to get close to humanity and help it. comes with the
knowledge of suffering. I went among the peasants:
I learned to know them; L absorbed their point of
view; I saw with their own eyesâ eyes touched with
pain.
"We are blind, like kittens, in our youth; our eyes
ate opened by living. No longer could Nature satisfy
me, though I loved her as well as ever. I took the
knowledge she had given me during my childhood into
(he homes of the poor, and I saw that life was all a
mysterious whole â mankind, mountains, pain and joy.
I had recovered then sufficiently to return to the stage.
1 went to Italy and first succeeded in Ophelia and San
tuzza. You see I could act now, because I had sui
ted. There is one thing I am sure of â believe me. I
know â no one can be an artist except through suffering.
No one can portray suffering except by feeling it, going
down into the depths, and no one can shadow forth love
until love has taken possession of the heart."
About Mme. Calves succession of triumphs during
recent years all the world knows. We gasp at the small
fortune paid her each time she sings; we watch her
wonderful acting with bated breath; we feel uplifted by
her voice and her presence. But not so much is known
pf Calve the woman â a topic which is certainly not a
whit less fascinating.
Each summer is spent at her chateau â her dear cha
teau â at Cabriere, near Aveyron. There is a pretty ro
mance connected with this country seat. When, as a
girl, she used to walk past this place each day, her most
daring dream was to some time be rich enough to pur
chase it. After success came the dream was realized.
To-day she spends as much time as possible there, in
company with her parents and brothers and sisters. To
the village folk Calve is an ideal Lady Bountiful. She
visits the poor, takes the sick all sorts of tempting deli
cacies, interests herself in securing positions for the un
employed. The village children fairly worship her.
Calve loves children. She will sit for hours on the lawn
under the big trees surrounded by a group of admiring
children, telling them strange tales of what she has seen
and heard in foreign lands, and relating legends of long
ago.
Calve has been criticized for wearing a petticoat of
crimson satin in the first act of "Carmen." "Perhaps
you think." she says, "that this satin petticoat is too rich
for a Spanish cigarette girl. But it is actually the most
realistic thing in my costume. You know I went to
Spain to study my costume, and it is absolutely correct.
I looked up the details of the cigarette girl's costume
in Seville, the city in which the scene of 'Carmen' is
laid. Carmen, you know, is not a paragon of virtue:
in iact. she is about as naughty as she can be. I
watched my cigarette girls at the very doors of the fac
tories. They ar c _!1 well aware that the refinement of a
lady's dress is as much in hVr lingerie as in her outer
c-itume. There are second-hand costume shops in
Spain just as there are in Paris, London and New
York. I tracked many of my models to these second
hand costumers. I saw one of them buy just such a
skirt as the one I am wearing, which I bought at the

show her brilliant petticoat. It proved that she was not
used to such finery and wanted people to notice her. I
make precisely the same point in the first act of the
opera. Then, the crimson roses which I wear in my
hair â here again I follow the costume of the Spanish

Calve is not without her superstitions. One of the
most fascinating points she makes in Bizet's opera, in
which she will be heard here, is the coquettish glance she
casts at herself in a small hand-glass. In one of he
performances recently the glass fell from her hand to
the stage. She was delighted when she picked it up to
find it was not brc!-en. Had it been she would have re
grrded it as a sure sign of misfortune.
When she rehearsed 'Carmen" for the fir*t time af>the
Opera Comique, after her return from Italy. she srave
the stage director much trouble. She hnH her own idea
of the role and insisted on ignoring his suggestions.
The stage director appealed to the manager, who had
been watching. "Leave her alone." he said "She has
no idea of Carmen, and she will find it out at the first
performance. It will be a good punishment for her."
The punishment has been international fame.

four above mentioned, little If anything
ha* appeared In print, hence In writing of
a trip In that section of the Sierras I feel
I am writing of a comparatively little
known district.
Starting from Fresno in May. by team.
Bell's ranch, thirty-five miles northeaster
ly and quite a distance up In the Sierras,
was reached the second day. Here the
pack train was to be outfitted, but as ar
rangements had been made in advance
and supplies brought up from Fresno It
was only a matter of a couple of days be
fore the pack saddles, kayaks and camp
paraphernalia were in order for the start
on a lung and. hard trio.
The pack animals, ten in number, were
all Msjpsjsjsjf to "be agreeably to the ar
rangements, but Pete, one of the mules,
objected most decidedly to being saddled.
The moment any efforts were made to
blanket him his heels were In the air and
for a time it looked as though his wishes
in the matter would have to be respected,
but finally after repeated efforts his ob
jections were overcome and In the end,
that is when we were at the end of the
trip, Pete proved a good pack animal.
Finally a start wan made, and when the
party, eleven men all told, with ten pack
animals, were strung out on the trail
winding up the mountain, with some of
the animals almost lost under their large
packs, they made quite an Imposing sight
Our first camp was in Hosea basin and
right good did the bacon and beans taste
that night after the long and hard trip
up the mountain. On the second day
while the pack train went ahead to make
camp at Biff Creek thrtt of us made, a
detuur, going up a mountain to the great
nuwmill of the Fresno Flume and Irriga
tion Company at Shaver. Here were to be
seen those Immense sugar and yellow
pines and cedars cut down by the score,
the logs drawn dow.n greased skidways
by cables, one or two miles In length,
drawn by immense stationary "bull" en
gines, to a reservoir, there to be floated
to the mill, cut up into lumber and sent
down a large V shaped flume, filled with
wnter, sixty miles or more and 6000 feet
lower in elevation, to the railroad at
Clovls.
To go down this flume In a boat Is a
most exhilarating ride, the scenery grand
as one goes around high cliffs and ridges,
but very dangerous and not often under
taken.
The following morning after some mem
bers of the party had negotiated for all
the stone mortars, baskets and the like at
a nearby rancheria and which was the
last habitation we saw, we Inquired of
THE SUNDAY CALL.
the Indians the whereabouts of the trail
we should take and to each inquiry as to
whether It ran north, south, east or west
we received phe assuring reply of "yes,"
an Indian's answer, we discovered, to any
question he does not understand. Other
questions received the same reply, but
when we pointed in a certain direction up
a mountain whefe we had been told was
a new trail and the yes came so decidedly
we concluded to try It, but a long and tire
some search through brush resulted in the
conviction that the new trail was a myth
and that the Indians' "yes" again meant,
I do not know. So we took an old trail
leading In another direction, but the high*
el up we climbed the steeper the trail be
came, till at about 1000 feet up it really
looked doubtful if the packs on the ani
mals would not prove too heavy and over
turn the brutes. It was only a few mo
ments before Pete and his pack fell over
and rolled 100 feet down an almost pre
cipitous slide to Its 'fooU
TVe all thought that would surely mark
Pete's last resting place as It had that of
several animals before, numerous skele
tons attesting to that fact; but upon be
ing relieved of his pack, Pete was up in
a moment, a little bit dazed, to be sure,
but, barring a few scratches, was soon
ready to go on. The pack train had hard
ly started, however, before another ani
mal lost Us balance and went rolling down
nearly as far as Pete had, but he, too.
had a miraculous escape from being
killed. All the while we hid been on this
trail a sheep herder a half mile off was
heard calling, "come back, come back,
come back," with a few oaths inter
spersed, but as his dog was continually
barking at the sheep, we supposed he
was calling it, and only learned a few
weeks later he was endeavoring to have
us come and take the regular stock trail,
the one we were on being used only by
the Indians when afoot.
The following day, after crowing the
? immit of Kiser Ridge at an elevation of
7500 feet, and over snow seven feet In
depth, we descended to the Mammoth
pool of the San Joaquln River 4000 feet
below, and through which all the water
from the Immense drainage area of over
one thousand square miles of the head
waters of the San Joaquin River passes.
Nothing could be grander than the sur
rounding scenery, Mount Lyell, the Min
arets and all the high Sierras appar
ently close at hand, completely covered
with deep snow and some living glaciers,
while almost all of the surrounding coun
try was clothed with grand forests of pine
and cedar timber. Here is the home of the
deer. In one area of a few square miles
their tracks were 'almost as numerous as
would be made by a band of sheep; but to
get into the country means a long and
difficult trip, once there, however, gamo
and trout can be had in abundance, but it
would be entirely too slow work for one
to fish alone, as I have seen trout, and
good-sized ones, too, caught as fast as
one could cast a line and another unhook
the fish.
Bear are plentiful also, as we saw nu
merous evidences of their presence. And
now for a bear story:
On a Sunday afternoon while in camp
high up in tht mountains a most peculiar
sound was heard a quarter of a mile or
so off. Eftrh person gave his opinion as
Khat it might be. One thought it was
Â» by a large bird, as h<> had hrn'rl
several years ago a lurse bird making, he
thought, a similar sound. Others thought
it an animal of some kind. <o to make it
Interesting I suggested a bear, which all
at once agreed it must be and hasty prep
arations were at once made for the hunt.
The rillt was examined and put in order,
the mazarine loaded full of cartridges and
a pocketful taken besides in case the brute
had a very tough skin and needed plenty
of lead; another armed himself with> the
best ax the camp afforded, another the
big butcher knife and the fourth a pistol;
while Major, the dog. was taken to make
the attack. As four, with all the imple
ments necessary for a close encounter,
seemed a large enough party to capture
or kill the unknown beast, whatever It
might be, the rest of us remained In camp
for developments.
The party went off elated at the thought
of killing a real live bear, and as at regu
lar intervals the sound continued, always
coming from the same direction, the
hunters felt dead sure of their game, but
after a lapse of fifteen minutes or so four
Bry much disappointed hunters returned
mele?s. They reported the game as
ving flown.
The truth of the matter was the sound
came from the wind blowing the limbs of
two trees together; so after that bear
hunting was a tabooed subject in camp.
This reminds mo of another â¢little excite
ment we had. With the exception of a
few nights, we never pitched the tents,
preferring to sleep on our cots in the
open air. So one night about midnight,
after all had retired. Major, who slept
near the cots, awakened camp with vocif
erous barking and would not be quieted.
One of the party upon arising to see the
cause informed us it was no more nor less
than that much-dreaded little animal, a
polecat, and that It was not more than
eight feet from three of us. What was to
be done? Major was inclined to attack it.
I knew that would be a fatal mistake, so
I grabbed the dog. Then one of the party
reached for his rifle and was for shooting
It right off, but if he merely maimed it.
what a fix we would be in! So he was per-
Enot to shoot: another tried to shoo
but the audacious little animal
not be shooed. Instead they said
c nearer, so a match was lit to see
which wny It really was headed for and
one of the party had the satisfaction of
seeing both its eyes, and he said they
were very large ones, too. This decided
us that it was going to stand its ground,
so what to do was the perplexing ques
tion. With Major barking and, several of
us yelling, still on it came, slowly, to be
sure, but It gave us cold shivers neverthe
hss. and we were on the point of desert-
Ing camp, when a second match was lit.
which revealed the cause of the whole ex
citement to be what? Only a bit of paper.
A very prominent feature of the country
Is Immense domes of granite, generally
bell-shaped, flanged at the bottom and
ranging In diameter from 50 to nearly lOOi)
feet. 'It Is one of these that has had
much to do with the formation of the
Mammoth pool.
From the pool the grade line of the pro
posed tunnel water conduit ran down the
canyon of the San Joaqutn with a fall of
seven and a half feet to the mile, while
the river had a fall of from 60 to 100 feet
In the same distance, so the river kept
falling lower and lower from the grade
line till at the end of the line, twenty-one
miles distant, it was 1730 feet below.
The survey down this line was an ex
ceedingly difficult one. For much of the
distance temporary trails had to be mad*
Â§ough dense brush or over cliffs to get
and from our work. One man carried
feet of three-quarter-inch rope the en
tire trip, which when a cliff had to be
scaled or worked around he would by
tome means get to a point above and
fasten the rope around a tree or rock,
while we below would swing around or
climb up the otherwise unscalable places.
Day after day almost every step we made
we took our lives In our hands, as a hesi
tation of but a moment In crossing
around cliffs or over those smooth and
treacherous domes would have meant a
fall and almost Instant death In the can
yon below, while the danger from fallln*
rocks was very great. While kneeling
and drinking at a little spring on a pre
cipitous slope, with two men standing
within three feet of me, another member
of tht party crowing a hundred feet or
more above accidentally loosened â¢
bowlder fifteen inches In diameter. He
called out a warning, and just as I looked
up the bowlder, with a whiz and a crash,
dashed down not three inches above my
head, striking the ground at the feet o*
the two men and then disappearing Into
the canyon below.
At another time, while I was directing
three men, standing but a few feet apait
and not more than a hundred feet ahead,
what brush to cut, a bowlder four feet in
diameter came dashing down the steep
slope, breaking trees ten Inches In diam
eter as If they were brush, sending rocks
flying in all directions and raising great
clouds of dust. That the men. or at leant
one, must be hit seemed inevitable; they
had Â« not a moment's warning and no
chance of escape, and the bowlder wti
going right for them. It was a moment
of great suspense, and only relieved when
with a great bang the bowlder struck the
bottom of the canyon and was shattere-i
to pieces. The dust cleared and it was
seen that by some miracle no one wm
even scratched. The bowlder passed so
near one of tne men he could have
touched it with his hand, and small rocks
all but grazed them. But happenings of
this kind were of almost daily occur
rence, and if the rocks did not slid* we
reversed the programme and slid on thÂ«
rocks ourselves.
The farther down the canyon we went
the wilder and more inaccessible It be
< ;im^. and there is no doubt that we
were pioneers of much of the way. Sud
denly one day we came upon a place
where a large bowlder had been recently
removed by human hands, but what for
and by whom was the perplexing ques
tion, and .only solved after a long search
revealed in an almost inaccessible place
an old-fashioned Mexican arastra for
crushing quarts. A little farther on was
found a recently and evidently hastily de
serted camp, with provisions and crudo
mining tools lying around. Search, as wu
did most thoroughly every possible loca
tion, we could find no trace of either the
mine or any trail such as one would ex
pect to find leading from a mine to an
arastraâ only single tracks, and they
seemed to lead in all directions, so it be
gan to ldok as though the mine location
would remain a mystery. But the last
day of our stay in that vicinity, and when
we were moving camp, one of the men
while out hunting accidentally found in a
dense brush thicket signs of the long
looked for trail, but so well was Its en
trance hidden that only an accident would
have revealed it.
tcall brought all of the party at once

w the winding trail, now through
brush, now over rocks, up a deep ravine.
At last, however, we were rewarded by
finding the entrance to the tunnel, and

mouth it was surely a long one*
We were soon in It, following itÂ» cir

THE CHINESE BELLE OF
AMERICA
WHEN the ridM rrom the

â¢oto''th!i BJore than the u.sual )-tir on

over the rail looking, as the wind flut

THE SUNOAY CALL.
The third little brightly arrayen vision
at the rail was Ah Chee, also a niece,
whom the madume is bringing to Ameriia
that Â»he may be educated In our lan
guage and leurn the ways of our people.
And tnere, too. In the embryo of a fu
ture American belle, for little Ah Chee la
good to look upon and, judging from ap
peurunctt, posnessPH a certain amount of
mischief, which if true is already one
point scored, for Celeutlal mischief Is ft
rarity. Madume Wu, with a pair of pearl
studded lorgnettes, which she hamiu-s
with the jchlo of a Parisian, searched ea- '
gerly the faces of those on shore, finally
spying her party. consisting of the Consul Â¦
General and rrtlrue. The rail was In
stantly deserted and first down the gang
plank went the tJny feet; then Into the
carriage like a flash. The door closed,
and the curious onlookers swerved their
Interest to others with evident traces of
mal de mer still paling their cheeks.
But Maiame Wu and Miss So Ching
Daisy Wu are good sailors, for when the
curds from the numerous interviewers
were sent up from the parlor in the home
of the Consul General they were not de

In a very straight backed and much be
carved chair gat Madame Wu in a gown,
of purple und black, hair swept straight
from her forehead and adorned with
pearls. -Ah, such pearlsâ truly crystallized
tears of the gods., pearls unrivaled in
beauty and size, 'as large as beans and
dozens of them. Diamonds, too. glittered

me, after the manner of* our own people

IN THE WORLD OF ART.
OWTNO to the new law passed by the
committee, of the San Francisco Art
Association, a law which barred the
admittance of oils, the exhibition
which opened Thursday evening.
November 7. at the Mark : Hopkins Insti
tute of Art showed rather bare walls, al
though most that passed the Jury this*
year were unusually good. This exhibi
tion -admitting only water colors, pastels
and black and whites is an experiment,
and as the first attempt to bring the .
water colors to prominence has been fairly \
â¢successful.. this ru.v of excluding the oils
will, henceforth be observed for the mid
year exhibitions.
The exhibition given : annually during
the spring months will continue to be gen- .
eral, including oils and sculpture. Al
though many of the old standbys, Keith,

ous by their' absence,* the opening was

those wonderful flowing garments the

Oriental women, in a bail room of Glbson
ian girls; will not the novelty alone sur
round her with a circle?
Bhe may not dance, she cannot swim.
she must not and cannot ience, for tradi
tion has decreed that the Chinese *omea
shall not exercise, but she may with her
tiny feet flutter across the polished floor
like a wind tossed flower. She may serve

mouth, with perfect propriety; she may
even use hair oil on those smooth black
tresses if the fancy takes her. and who -
will bid her change the custom or her
native land?
MÂ»y the decree go forth, that never In
Washirston society nor elsewhere will lit
tle Daisy Wu adopt our American dress,
although she does smilingly observe that
she would sometimes like tA. May sh*
never shadow those almond eyes with a
lop of hair over the left si.de of her
smooth forehead; may she never even
cherish the wish to lose her grace in tight
stays, for the true poetry of China Is sym
bolized in her native dress.
The Consul General says that the so
briquet Daisy is a pet name, and we must
admit that the enphonlous combination of
Daisy Wu is alone enough to launch a
young lady into the top wave of society
and Insure her meteoric fame. But. after
all, Daisy weans nothing in particular,
while Miss Daisy's other name So Ching,
translated into our tongue, becomes
"beautiful and gentle." Some way. to the
American mind. So Chlng seems a trifle
more consistent with the soft silk gown
of violet and srreen. of blue and silver.
Little Ah Chee. which means "golden
branches." stubbornly insists upon keep
ing her own name, and I think Ah Chee
is likely to have her way about it.
for already this tiny maid is showing
signs of emancipation, the most impor
tant, perhaps, beginning with her feet,
whtrh are unbound, their natural sixe al
lowing her to skip and hop about In the
delightful manner of any mischievous lit
tle girl. Ah Chee is quite ready to talk.
too, for. in her own tongue, of course,
she told me all about the beautiful gown
she wore, which was almost the counter
part of her cousin So Ch'.ng'a. She show
ed me her TTttle brown hands, with long
polished nails. Her eyeÂ« widened and
flashed In parts of her conversation,
which I took for granted was all aboot
America, and which I would give much
to understand, for by the decided chin
and prettily shaped lips, somewhat
straight nose and well defined brows, lit
tle Ah Chee is fully capable of holding
any one's attention.
This little mis? will, with the advantage
of her natural sized foot, go in for danc
ing and will perhaps overcome the edicts
of her countrywomen by fencing, play
ing tennis, polo, and way oft some time m
the future may have a yacht and sail it,
too.
Speaking of the change In China sine*

Madume Wu says that the mark of aris
tocratic caste, the traditional small foot
of th* Chinese woman, is being less ob
served. Slowly but sÂ«ure4y the sentiment
is chilngiiiK and there is a general incli
nation to allow the feet of the younger
ji'-ntrntion to reach their normal six*.
Whi'e large feet will perhaps never
dominate In the aristocratic families.
those following the more modern way will
not. as of other days, be ostracized from
the inner circle of society.
5 Next year an effort will be made to have
a larger space given to the black and
whites. . .
The rules governing the Bohemian Club
exhibition this year are unusually rigor
ous, giving us a forewarning that the ex
hibition which opens . the first week in
December will be exceptionally good.
Heretofore the artists have sent an un
limited number of canvases, but this year
the notices are posted that only five can

; vr.. WASHINGTON, Nov. {..-Proof that
Germany is supporting the application of
the Hamburg- American line to acquire a
coaling station at Cartagena. Colombia,
as been furnished the State Department
by the American Consul at Cartagena.
John G. Ingersoll. who succeeded Joseph
Bowron as Consul at Cartagena, has flle.-l
the Information with Secretary of State
Hay His report is highly important. Ho
states positively that he has reliable In
formation v.-ing that the Hamburg-
American line has made application both
lor a coaling nation and for a reduction
cf duties on the material they desire to
import into the state In connection with
its establishment; that its application is
being earnestly supported by the German
Consul; that, in fact, it has. in the form
Of a memorial, been transmitted through
him ar.d the German legation at Bogot>
v- the Colombian Government.
Significance of Application.
It Is, of course, to be expected that the
ierman Minister to Colombia will make
-very effort to obtain the approval of the
application by the Bogota authorities. In
gersoll makes no comment upon the in
formation, saying that its "significance"
will doubtless be appreciated by the Sec
retary of State. It has never been the
practice of the United States to oppose
legitimate enterprise, whether American
or foreign. In South and Central Amer
ica, and It Is doubtful If the State De
partment will interfere actively to pre
vent the concession being granted the
Hambjrg-American line, dangerous as it
is as aa entering wedse to the main
tenance of the Monroe doctrine. Consul
Ingersoll has undoubtedly forwarded a
duplicate of his report to the State De
partment to Minister Hart, and that of
ficial will use his unofficial influence to
prevent favorable action upon the appli
cation.
Senor Herran. Colombian Charge d'Af
faires, proposes to inform his Govern
ment cf the attitude of the United States
relative to the application of the Ham
burg-American line, and, jingoistic as the
Governor of Cartagena Is, he doubts if
the German move to acquire a coaling
p et&tlon on the shores of the Caribbean
Sea will meet with success.
Great Advantage to Germany.
Discussing the effect of the acquisition
by the Hamburg-American line of a coal-
Ing station at Cartagena, a prominent
naval officer said to-day:
"Besides the Atlas line, which the Ham
burg-American Company controls, the
German company also runs a line of
steamers direct from Germany to Carta
gena. These vessels are manned by Ger
mans, who are thus well acquainted with
the navigation of the Caribbean Sea. In
time of war the ships, which are operated
under a subsidy granted by the German
Government, Till be Impressed into tho
German service. A coaling station would,
of course, be useful as a base for the op
â¢rations of a German squadron in the
Caribbean Sea. With such a base the
command of the Panama and Nicaragua
canals would t-e assured, provided the
force were sufficiently strong, as Carta
gena is nearer to those two points than
Is the United State*. It would be dan
gerous to American Interests to permit
Germany to acquire a coaling station a"
Cartagena, even under the guise of a con
cession to a subsidized German steamship
line."

TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED ELECTRIC VOLTS
FAIL TO KILL JUMBO II AT BUFFALO EXPOSITION
Big Elephant Declines to Die and Is Merely Tickled by the Six
Shocks Applied on the Platform.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUFFALO, N. V., Nov. 9.â Harnessed with electrodes aAd other apparatus. Jumbo II stood In the middle of the stad
lum at the Exposition grounds at sundown to-day and gave the world a practical demonstration that an elephant
can take 2200 volts of electricity with pppurent unconcern. Whether from defective connections or from Insufficient â¢
current, when the switch that wai supposed to turn the death flood of electricity Into the elephant's body was turned
on, Jumbo merely threw a trunkful of dirt over his back and refused to die. If the electric current reached him at all
he did not express a bit of annoyance.
Electric wires had been run from the exposition power house to what was to be Jumbo's death platform, and when
the signal was given 2200 volts were turned on. It merely tickled the beast. After the unsuccessful attempt to kill Mm, Jum
bo wan unhitched from his harness and taken back to his home In the Midway.
.Explanations made by the electricians for the failure were that Jumbo's hide had the resistance of rubber and that this
formed a non-conductor Impervious to electricity. Others declare that If It take* 1800 volts to kill a man It would necessar
ily take more than 2200 volts to kill an elephant.
Jumbo was chained to a plank platform. Electrodes the sin of a large sponge were placed behind his ears and at
the end of his spinal column. Only 2200 volts had been provided for by those in chars*. The shock was repeated six times.
Jumbo wagged his tall, tore up a- plank with his trunk, looked pleased and trumpet** a bit. Th* shocks had simply tickled
him. When led back to his quarters the elephant was none the worse for bis electric bath. -

"We were Intimate, not always on the

Then McLaughlln took up Hume's
statement that McKensie had informed
him that 165.000 was paid for Judge Noyes'
appointment, that he secured*, railroad
transportation and paid his expenses.
"Alexander McKenzie never paid a ho

McKenzie and the Judge.
"If McKensle spent $66,000. then it must
have been in bribing Senators and Con
gressmen T' asked McLaughlln.
"I can't see how McKenzie ever spent
a dollar," answered Noyes.
"It was necessary to obtain the favor
of Cushman K. Davis to secure the ap
pointment, was It not?"
"Yes. he was the senior Senator."
"Do you know what McKensle did do?"
"I do not. I presume he did every
thing he could."
Noyes testified further that Senator Da
vis told him that he went to McKtnley
for his appointment. Then followed a de
tailed account of the preliminary plans
for the organisation of the court In Alaska
and the selection of court officers.
"Did you, before proceeding to Alaska,
agr?e on anything else but a division of
the district?" continued McLaughlin in
direct examination.
"I appointed Mr. Borchscnlus and a dep
uty clerk," answered the witness.
"When you reached Seattle was McKen
zle there?"
"I was informed so, but had not seen
him or hesjrd of him since I left Wash
ington."
"Did you meet Robert Chips there for
the first time?"
"No, sir, in Washington; afterward in
Beattle."
JUDGE ARTHUR H. NOTEB, LATE
OF NOME, ON THE WITNESS
STAND.
"When did you first get acquainted with
Mr. Dickey, the deputy clerkr*
"I knew him In Minneapolis, where be
had a reputation as a capable man."
According to Judge Noyes Dickey was
the able man who was going to' establish
and instruct Borchsenlus -In his duties.
The work of an Alaska District Judge
was no easy matter from the recital, and
Noyes detailed not only his own duties but
those of the clerk, after which Judge Mc>
Laughlln took him from Seattle to Nome.
Noyes' acquaintanceship with Marshal
Vawter and Archie Wheeler came up In
natural sequence. Wheeler, another Min
neapolis friend of the Judge, went to
Alaska with Judge Noyes. Upon the lat
ter's arrival the meeting with attorneys
was exploited.
Then McLaughlln steered the witness
Into Nome and called his attention to the
meeting between Judge Johnson and
Judge Noyes on Saturday. Noyes said
he probably told Johnson that he intend
ed to go to St. Michael on Monday.
Just as the morning session closed Judge
McLaughlln reached the day when Mc-
Kenxle was appointed receiver in the
Chips versus LJnderbcrg case.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 O STREET, 27.
"W., WASHINGTON, Nor. Iâ No matter
how desirable it may be to men who are
paying the tax, there seems to be abso
lutely no likelihood that there will be a
wholesale reduction of the so-called war
taxes. Secretary of the Treasury Gaga
to-day authorized a denial of the report
that" he, the President and Mr. Payne,
chairman of the House Committee on
Ways and Means, had agreed that all the
war taxes should go.
"I have not yet made up my mind as
to what reduction I will recommend in
my report," said Gage. "There are sev
eral things which will be considered as
preventing the passages of a bill abolish
ing all these taxes at one' swoop. Un
doubtedly some odds and ends that now
cause annoyance should come off. The
question what to do with the surplus la
a very important one, and I prefer to
leave that to be discussed *In my report. "
Vast Revenue Is Required-
There will be a loud outcry from prac
tically all the members of Congress who
are after appropriations against any larg.Â»
redaction* of the war taxes. Senator
Hanna In his Interview with a Call cor
respondent expressed this feeling; when he
said that he would tell Secretary Gago
how to spend the surplus If it was worry
ing him. ' The expenditures of the next
Congress are likely to exceed those of any
Congress, with the exception of tha
period of the war with Spain.
President Roosevelt wants a great navy,
and the expenses of the army cannot be
reduced. There must be a river and har
bor bill at this session, and It is likely
to be a record-breaker. In addition to
that the coming Congress Is likely to
authorize the construction of the Nlca
raguan canal, and If that great work, be
undertaken there is no likelihood - that
there will be any effort to keep down the .
surplus. All the surplus that can be
hoarded will be needed to give the people
their hearts* desire In the form of a wat- ;
erway connecting the Atlantic and Pa- >
cine. *
What TJaxes Axe Costing; â¢- â¢ Â«
These are things that make everybody .
skeptical when there is a report that a
somebody Is going to make Congress cut "
down the war revenue taxes. The' war â¢
taxes are now costing the public at the
rate of about 125,384 a day. The accom- S
panying figures show the working* of the
reduction made by the last Congress for -
the first quarter of the fiscal year begin
ning July. It Is shown that there has
been a decrease In. these taxes for the I
quarter amounting to $9,196,544 9L For the '
year the reduction will .be less than $36,
0,000 because there has been an increase
In other Items that will offset the expect
ed reduction. Congress had estimated the Â£
reduction at 140,000.000. The total fiscal
receipts for this year are likely to be in
round ' numbers . about $90,000,000. It is 'â¢"*
doubtful If Congress can be prevailed on
to make a greater reduction than about Â»
$30,000,000. ' v

A Daily Nuisance,
A Simple Remedy Which Will In-
terest Catarrh Sufferers.
In its earlier stages catarrh Is more of
a nuisance than a menace to the general ;
health, but sooner or later, the disease
extends to the throat, bronchial tubes
and e\en to the stomach and intestines.
Catarrh Is essentially a disease of thÂ« '
mucous membrane, the local symptoms
being a profuse discharge of mucus,
stoppage of the nostrils, Irritation Â¦ in
throat, causing coughing, sneering, gag-
ging and frequent clearings of the throat
and head.
The usual treatment by local douches,
snuffs, salves, etc., often gives temporary
relief, but anything like a cure can only
be obtained by a treatment which removes
the catarrhal taint from the blood and '
the disappearance of the inflammation
from thÂ« mucous surfaces.
A new remedy which meets these re-
quirements and which so far has been re-
markably successful in curing catarrh Is
Stuarts Catarrh Tablets.
These tablets act upon the blood and
mucous membranes only. They can hard-
ly be called a secret patent medicine as
they are composed of such valuable rem-
edies a* Sanguinarla, Hydrastin. Eucalyp-
tol and similar cleansing antiseptics which
cure by eliminating from the blood and
mucous surfaces the catarrhal poison. '
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are large,
pleasant tasting lozenges taken internally,
allowing them to dissolve slowly in the
mouth; In this way they reach the throat,
fauces and the entire alimentary canaL
If desired, they may also be dissolved
In water and used as a douche. In addi-
tion to the internal use. but it Is not at
all necessary to use a douche; a few of
them dissolved in the mouth daily will
be sufficient. However, when there Is
much stoppage of the nose, a douche
made from these tablets will give imme-
diate relief, but the regular daily use in-
ternally of these tablets will cure the
whole eatarrhal trouble without resorting
to the Inconvenience of a douche.
Dr. Bement states "that the Internal
treatment for catarrh is rapidly taking
the place of the old plan of douching, and
local application and further says that
probably the best and certainly the safest
remedy at present on the market is Stu-
art Catarrh Tablets, as no secret is
made of their composition and all the
really efficient remedies for catarrh are
contalred in this tablet."
Druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
at fifty cents for full sized packages. Ask
your druggist and if he is honest he will
tell you there is no safer, more palatable,
more efficient and convenient remedy on
the market.
Tumors and Wens treated in from one
to three minutes by the hypodermic
needle and permanently cured. We are
the only doctors treating cancer who
positively do not use the knife. Let

RAINSTORM IS WORKING SOUTHWARD
AND NO SECTION WILL BE SLIGHTED
Downpour That Deluges San Francisco Is General Through
out Northern and Central California and Down-Coast
Points Are Expecting a Share of the Precipitation
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 9.â A light
rain set in at 6 o'clock this even
ing, the precipitation being a
small fraction of an inch. A
message from Truckee says that
snow is falling on the summit and that
the barometer indicates a heavy storm
impending. All crops. Including grapes
and apples in the foothills, are garnered
so the storm causes no damage. Show
ers are general throughout the Sacra
mento Valley.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.â The weather
conditions have threatened rain all day
and to-night the indications continue
favorable. The Weather Bureau in Los
Angeles predicts showers to-night or to
morrow. There is no wind and clouds
that threaten moisture at any moment
cover the sky.
STOCKTON. Nov. 9.â A light rain com
menced falling to-night, and. while it has
been coming down steadily, the total pre
cipitation has been less than a quarter
of an inch. Some beans may be caught
out, but in this Immediate vicinity the
damage will not amount to much. The
indications are for more rain.
FRESNO, Nov. 9. â Rain commenced
falling here at 10 o'clock to-night, and
since then there has been a continuous
drirzle. Judging from the denseness of
the clouds, there probably will be rain
throughout the night. There will be no
damage to raisins. The rain was needed.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 9. â A telephone mes
sage from Julian this afternoon said sev

MUTINOUS CREW
ON THE FORMOSA
British Bark Has Excit
ing Trip Around the
Horn.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 9.â The British bark
Formosa arrived this afternoon from
Antwerp, after a passage of only 117 days
âone of the best ever made around the
Horn to this coast. Captain H. F. Fret
wurst came in with one man in irons and
about half of the crew in a state border
ing on mutiny. The man in Irons is M.
Osterman. and he has been shackled for
two weeks because of an attempt on the
captain's life after a quarrel with the
first officer, in which the captain inter
fered.
The sailor was using rough and insult
ing language to the mate at the culmina
tion of several days of mutlnouÃ conduct
on the part of the men before the mast,
and Captain Fretwurst ordered him to
desist. Osterman turned with an oath,
picked up an iron bejaying pin and threw
it at the captain, missing that officer's
head by only a few inches and making
a mark on the woodwork of the vessel
â¢ufllciently deep to indicate that it would
have been' a fatal blow if it had landed.
With the help of the other officers Os
terman was secured and put into Irons.
The crew continued in a state bordering
on mutiny, and for that reason Osterman
was kept in irons until this port was
reached. As soon as ancnor was dropped
in the stream Captain Fretwurst. alter
making his report to the consignees, has
tened to the office of British \ ice Consul
Allen to lodge a complaint against Oster
man and others, and it is probable that
there may be a hearing of the charges
before the Consul here and a fixing of the
punishment.
Captain Fretwurst is of the opinion that
the cause of the trouble Is to be found
in the fart that the men would like to
be discharged with their full pay on this
coast, for the reason that they can get
better pay by remaining here or signing
for the return trip on some othef vessel,
as sailors are very much In demand on
the coast.

ily all day, with a prospect for heavy

ASTORIA. Or., Nov. 9.â The steamer
Victoria arrived from the Orient this
afternoon. She brings news that political
disturbances hover on the horizon In
Japan. The Sclyu Kai. or the immediate
followers of Marquis Ito, have now ar
rayed themselves on the side of the Cab
inet's enemies. This section of the big
party is headed by Baron Suyematgu.
Mr. Haraskel and Baron Kaneko. They
propose to arraign the Cabinet on the
ground that the measures ot administrat
ive and financial reform contemplated by
the ministry are altogether too limited
and that the Cabinet's failure to sell
bonds abroad Is due to mismanagement.
They also complain of the failure to pun
ish officers guilty of looting in China,
against which there Is now considerable
feeling in Japan.
The terms of the new Manchurian agree
ment, as published by Japanese papers,
are as follows:
1. That Rural* la to enjoy the exclusive title
to all mining and railway privileges in Man
churia.
2. That all the Chlneee troops In Manchuria
axe to be placed under Russian command.
1. That two year* alter peace and good order
have been restored Russia will withdraw one
half of her force* and three years after that
date the remainder; and
4. That the Shanalkwan-Newchwanc railway
shall be restored to China on condition that
It Is never used for the conveyance of British
troops.
It is said that the Korean Government
has decided, though no official announce
ment has yet been made, to pardon the
persons suspected of complicity in the
murder of the late Queen. Most of these
persons are now refugees In Japan.
The Kobe Chronicle says the captains
and flallors (forty-eight in number) of the
two Japanese "sealing schooners which
were recently seized by the Russian au
thorities on a charge of fishing In Russian
wuters were sent down to Vladivostok,
where they are now undergoing examina

by the advice of some Frenchmen, ob
tained all the materials from the latter's
native country. I'nable to pay wages and
for the material the dock yard authorities
are arranging the sale of the warships
through the French Consul In Fuchow.
MOUNTAIN LION KILLING
STOCK NEAR WOODBRIDGE
Two Hunters Who Come Upon the
Beast Are Forced to Beat a
B>etreat.
STOCKTON. Nov. 9.â A large California
lion is raiding the district along the
Mokelumne River below Woodbridge. The
ferocious animal has already killed a
number of hogs, sheep and chickens. The
residents of that section are fearful that
it may attack some child.
The lion was seen by Benjamin Aldridge
of Woodbridge and a companion last
Wednesday afternoon. Aldridge and his
companion were hunting quail along the
river. Suddenly, as they came around .1
bend In the river, they came Into view
of the Hon. It was crouching over t*ie
rarrasn of a freshly killed pig, and
growled ferociously as it caught sight of
the young hunters. They were afraid to
shoot it, for the reason that their guns
were loaded with small shot only. The
lion was remarkably bold. It stood its
ground, even though the hunters ad
vanced toward It. They themselves were
rt-qulred to retreat.
To-morrow a party of hunters will start
out to kill the Hon.
Grau Scores Financial Success.
I.OS ANOELES, Nov. 9.â The Orau op

Los Angeles to-night with an elaborate
performance of "LeÂ« Huguenots." The
company will leave this city In a special

was highly successful from a financial
standpoint, judging by the large attend
ance at each performance.
Sacramento If Growing.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 9.-Statlstics Just
completed show a remarkable growth In
the city of Sacramento during the past
year. On July 1. 1890, there were In thltf
city 146 vacant nouses. On November 1
of this year this number has been re
duced to 90, while probably 60 new houses
have gone up and been occupied by fam
ilies.
Planning for Another Carnival.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 9.â The citizens
of Sacramento are actively carrying on a
campaign for another Street Fair and
Trades Carnival next spring, and already
more than $10,000 has been subscribed by
merchants and others. It Is intended to
mane these annual festivals a permanent
feature.
King Edward's Birthday.
LONDON, Nov. 9.â The King spent his
birthday' at Sandringham with the Queen,
the Princess of Wales and the rest of the
royal family. There was no official ob
servance of the day, with the exception
of the customary salutes at Windsor and
at the naval and military headquarters
and the ringing of church bells. â¢
AFTER much anxious waiting on
the part of the farmers and rub
ber coat and umbrella vendors,
and considerable forecasting on
the part of Alexander McAdle,
Uncle Sam's expert weather watcher, thÂ«
first .real good rainstorm of the winter
put In an appearance yesterday. It ar
rived without ostentation. During the
afternoon it hardly induced the ruislng
of an umbrella and had the effect ol mak
ing former residents of Oregon and Wash
ington feel comfortably at home.
As the darkness fell, however, Jupiter
Pluvius gained courage and soon after o
o'clock the rain was pelting the home
going throngs with soaking effect, flush
ing the gutters and sewers and bringing
anxiety to the hearts of evening amuse
ment promoters.
In spite of the discomforts the rain was
acclaimed on all hands as a blessing. It
brought down* the high spirits of the
Berkeleyites to a normal pitch and formed
a nttlng cover for the exodus to Palo Alto
of the Stanford contingent.
The storm struck the central part of
the State first and spread gradually in all
directions. Its approach was announced
to Forecaster McAdie in a telegram from
Point Conception. This was only one of
a series of telegraphic messages received
at the Weather Bureau during the day,
and McAdle announces that by Monday
morning the entire State will have re
ceived a thorough drenching.
The rainfall la the Interior was very
heavy. It* was particularly welcome In
the agricultural districts, where the crops
were beginning to feel the effects of the
long period of drouth.
A strong southeast wind is blowing out
side the neads and mariners have been
warned to lock out for rough weather.

was taken from the ground two days ago.
Assayer W. O. Brown makes a different

out late yesterday. While he will not
give out the figures to-night, he says the
assay shows values something less than

SENATOR FLINT
MAKING GAINS
Confident He Will Win
the Gubernatorial
Nomination.
Special Dispatch to The CUI.
LOS ANOELES, Nov. 9.â Senator
Thomas Flint Jr., of San Benito County,
who Is in the south looking after his
gubernatorial fences, will remain In the
vicinity of Los Angeles a week beforo
leaving with his wife for Sonora, Mexico,
where Mr. Flint is Interested in mining
ventures.
The Senator declares that If he can
obtain 40 per cent of the Los Angeles
County, delegation In the next State con
vention he will win the nomination for
Governor. Mr. Flint holds that the re
sult of the recent municipal election In
San Francisco Is a blow aimed at boss
ism and that the election of Schmlta In
the bay city portends success to his own
candidacy. A beginning In the right di
rection in California Republican politics,
Mr. Flint declares, was made when
Thomas R. Bard was elected United
State* Senator.
The issue then was plain and, according
to his ideas, the best element in party
f>olltlcs prevailed. Next year the same
sue will arise, and on the result of the
primaries will depend whether the fruits
of the victory gained in Senator Bard's
election are to be retained or thrown
away.
Senator Flint says he has promises of
support in the convention from one end
of the State to the other, and that he ex
pects to obtain a large part of the San
Francisco delegation. In the San Joaquln
Valley he Is advised that sentiment It
forming the same way, and the northern
counties send word of good cheer to him
self.
Mr. Flint asserts that should Governor
Gage fall to obtain a solid delegation In
his home territory he cannot get a sec
ond nomination.

just before adjournment this afternoon.
On Monday morning the opening state
ment of the defense will be made and
the examination of witnesses in behalf of
Considir.e begun. Between 90 and 1W wit
nesses have been summoned for the de
fense, end while it is not probable that
all of these will be called to the stand
the defense does not expect to reach the
tr.d of its testimony before next Satur
day. Arguments and the charge to the
jury probably will be carried over to the
following week.
The case of the prosecution, as It now
stands, rests upon the theories that for
s( me wec-ka or even months, prior to the
bhooting John Constdine had been heard
to make threats against Meredith; that
when the two Considlne brothers met
Meredith at Guy's drug store on the aft
ernoon of June 25 a first shot was fired
outside the store either by Thomas Con
Â«i<Jine or by some unknown person In the
Ccnsidine interests, and that this shot
drove Meredith to the use of his shotgun
in self-defense.
The third, and so far as evidence goes,
the best supported contention of the pros
ecution, is that Meredith was insensible
and helpless from the blows struck upon
his head by Thomas Considlne before
John Considine fired the three shots, one
of which !b conff<ied to have been the
cause of Meredith's death.
Mrs. Meredith, the widow of the de
ceased, was on the witness stand this af
ternoon. Ht examination was brief. She
tald In response to questions that when
her husband left home farly on the after
noon of th<- killing she noticed nothing
unusual in his manner. Mrs. Meredith
was a;>kÂ«l no questions by the defense.
Three well-known physicians gave ex
pert testimony to-day, responding to a
hypothetical question as to the effect
up'/n a person of blows on the head such
as Â»he *vldÂ«Â»nce showed Meredith to have
received. They united In the belief that
partial, if not complete, unconsciousness
must *-n?u<\ Asked a.Â« to what-condltlon
a man would be In under such clrcum-
Btances, Dr. P. B. M. Miller nald:
"He would be Incapable of making an
assault and perfectly defenseless from an
attack of any kind."
The cross-examinations of these wit
nesses Indicated the purpose of the de
fense to attempt to show that Meredith
was still capable of attacking John Con
fMo'ln*'. and did In fact make a motion to
ward his coat pocket, which contained
another revolver, when he was shot by
John ConnMlne.
If M. Hammond, who gave important
tfftlmony for the Rfate in the preliminary
hearing, and who nan been missing since
that time, showed up last night and ap

POOLROOM MAN
FIGHTS EDITOR
Meet on Bridge Between
Sacramento and
Washington.
Proprietor of a Yolo County
Paper Is Worsted in Say- ,
age Encounter.
Bpeolal Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 9.â R. C. Gorton,
editor of the Yolo County Message, and
Ed L. Kripp, partner of Angus Ross in
the Washington poolrooms, met this af
ternoon on the bridge which connects
Washington with Sacramento and a sav
age fight ensued. The editor drew a
pistol and the poolroom owner seized It
and threw It into the river. Blood marks
on the bridge flooring told of the lively
character of the combat. The editor was
brought home for repairs.
The Message, which Is published in
Washington, across the river, came out
this morning with an article bitterly de
nouncing Kripp and the poolrooms. Kripp
says that when he met Gorton on the
bridge he began speaking about the of
fensive article, whereupon the editor
whipped out his revolver. Kripp wrested
It from his grasp, and throwing it over
the bridge rail, proceeded to "lick the
editor."
The poolrooms, under Kripp & Roas'
management, reopened in Washington
this morning, the nrm having arranged
to get the news of the races from Oak
land, despite the order of the New Calt
fornla Jackey Club forbidding the send
ing of reports to poolrooms.
Kripp ridicules the idea that the people
of Washington want him to get out of
the town. He says that he has within
the past few weeks helped to strengthen
the levees and install water mains and
fire plugs, and that he intends to give
the town a hose cart.
Whether or not the Washlngtonlans re
gard Kripp as a philanthropist, they have
thus far made no serious effort to close
his poolrooms.
CONCENTRATION
CHAFFEE'S PLAN
War Department Acts
on General's Recom
mendation.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 9.â On the recom
mendation of General Chaffee, command
ant of the Division of the Philippines, the
Secretary of War has Issued an order for
the reorganization of that division. Up
to this time the division has comprised
four military departments as follows:
Department of Northern Luzon, com
manded by Major General Lloyd
Wheaton; Department of Southern
Luzon, commanded by Brigadier General
J. 8. Wade; Department of the Vlsayas,
commanded by Brigadier General R P.
Hughes; Department of Mindanao and
Jolo. commanded by Brigadier General G.
W. Davis.
In accordance with the action of the
War Department to-day the division will
be divided into only two military depart
ments, to Include within their limits the
entire Philippine archipelago. They will
be known as the Department of the
North and the South Philippines. The
Northern Department will be commanded
by Major General Wheaton and will in
clude the island? of Luxon. Mlndora and
Masbate, and ail the intervening terri
tory. The Southern Department, which
will be commanded by Brigadier General
Wade, will embrace the remainder of the
archipelago, and Include the large Islands
of Samar, Panay, Mindanao, the Vlsayas
and Jolo.
The consolidation of these departments
is in accordance with General Chaffee's
plan to lnatltutte a vigorous aggress l ye
campaign against the insurrectionists,
who recently have become active and
troublesome In the Islands of Samar,
Leyte and In the extreme southern por
tions of Luzon. It Is understood that
large bodies of troops are to be concen
trated in the districts where outbreaks
have occurred under the command of offi
cers of high rank with the full purpose
of promptly stamping out the spirit of In
surrection. It is said, furthermore, that
the reduction In the number of depart
ments In addition to making the military
forces more compact and efficient wIU
result in a reduction of expenses.

last few steamers arriving from the
Orient have brought but few Celestials
but the Adelaide broke the record of the
past three years by not bringing a single

Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN JOSE, Nov. 9.â A monkey that had

boya to-day attacked little Josle Taylor,
the 8-year-old daughter of Mrs. Jackson,
who resides at 12U EaÂ»t San Antonio

ihjuriea. As It was, the girl waa knocked
down and her right wrist badly lacerated

scratched and her clothing torn. The
wound in the wrist is a painful one and
very dangerous, as it 1b near a big artery.

SIMPLE NATIVES
THESE TUTUILAS
Commander Tilley's Re
port Tells of Island
Conditions.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 9.-While Com
mander Benjamin F. TlMey, commandant
of the United States naval station at Tu
tulla, Samoa, was in Washington recent
ly be submitted to Secretary Long his an
nual report on affairs and conditions In
this Island possession.
Commander Tilley says that the Tutu-
Has are a gentle, kindly, simple-minded
people, and that the form of government
! Instituted by the United States ha*
! proven very popular with them. He re
. counts the numerous Improvements in
the system of self-government which
have been suggested to the people and
i eagerly agreed to by them. Two of the
: conditions which needed reform were
! noteworthy.
Every once in a while, says Commander
Tilley, a whole village would make up its
mind to go on a "melanga," or visiting
party. All work would be abruptly
i btopped and all ages and sexes woull
start out on a wandering holiday. The
spirit of hospitality, he sayi. Is cultivated
' to an extreme among the natives, and at
1 every village visited by the rovers the
hosts felt it their bounden duty to enter
; tain lavishly.
The visiting party would stay at one
village just as long as their entertainers
could provide food for them. When sup
plies ran out they bade hasty adieus and
moved on to the next village to be "en
tertained." Commander Tilley says that
there never was a time that a "melanga"
; was not in progress somewhere in the Isl
and.
Another custom was the bestowing of
present* of great value at weddings and
other ceremonies, a practice which was
carried to such excess that a single wed
i ding often Impoverished a whole village.
Summing up the work In Tutulla. Com
mander Tilley rays an organized govern
ment has been established, which keeps
i the people quiet and happy and Is help-
Ing them materially In their Journey
along the pathway toward complete clv
', Illzatlon.

IRRIGATION PROJECT
Director of Geological Surveys Says
Congress Will Take Up Arid
Lands Problem.
PASADENA. Nov. 9.â Dr. Charles D.
Walcott, director of geological surveys of
the United States, Is visiting Southern
California to inform himself more fully
of the needs of this section with a view
to legislation in the Interests of forestry
and Irrigation of arid lands. He says:
"Though both the President and Con
gress are favorably disposed the present
diffusion of responsibility with different
departments causes loss of action. The
two Interests should be united in a bureau
of forestry, which we hope soon to ac
complish. If the water that annually runs
to waste In the arid regions of the West
was stored and used for irrigation the
western half of the United States would
sustain a greater population than our
entire eastern country contains to-day
The Government should construct and
maintain reservoirs, as It does other pub
lic works."
Dr. Walcott nromlses that the Govern
ment will take hold of the movement next
year and great things may be expected.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS
CALL ON MARK HANNA
Senator Says There Was No Confer
ence and Talks of the
Memorial.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â Senator Hanna
reached this city to-day. A number of
Republican leaders called on him at his
hotel, but the Senator said there was
nothing about his meeting with them that
partook of the nature of a conference.
Among those leaders were: Joseph H.
Manley of Maine. Henry c. Paine of Wis
consin, vice chairman of the Republican
National Committee: R. C. Kerens of Mis
souri. Senator Stephen B. Elklns of West
Virginia and Myron T. Ilcrlck of Cleve
land.
In an Interview which will appear in the
World to-morrow Senator Hanna is re
ported an saying in reference to the me
morial to President McKinley to be erect
ed at Canton:
We do not contemplate any great historic
memorial, aa do some of the promoters of the
memorial nchernÂ« In Washington. We believe
that If there in to be a f?reat hlntorlc memorial
at Washington It should have beÂ«n thought of
years ago to honor the memory of Lincoln
and other great men. Our plan Is to have a
slmplw nvmorlal that will show the affection of
the peoplo for President McKinley. We believe
that the people win respond to this sentiment.
The Senator refused to tell what wag
said at the private interview between
Prenldent Roosevelt and himself at Wash
ington, but he dilated on the high char
acter o0 Roosevelt and expressed the
greatest confidence in him.

JURY'S VERDICT
CHARGES FRAUD
Cross-Complaint of the
W. B. Frue Estate Is
Sustained.
SALINAS, Nov. Â».-In the suit of the
Commercial and Savings Bank of San
Jose vs. J. H. Suits, administrator of the
estate of W. B. Frue. wherein the latter
brought a cros^-complalnt against Mltcii
ell Phillips and Fred W. Moore, the Jury
to-night brought in a verdict in favor of
J. H. Snlts.
The Jury decides that Frue at the time
of the purchase of the Lagunitag ranch
from Phillips was, owing to his befud
dled condition from the constant use of
liquors, not in a fit state of mind to
transact business; that Mitchell Phillip
and Frank W. Moore by fraud and mis
representation Induced William B. Frue
to purchase the Lagunlta ranch; that
they conspired to induce Frue to pur
chase the ranch. The Jury placed the
value of the ranch as a whole at $12,366.
This is $13,634 less than the amount Frue
paid for the property.
An appcul probably wllL be taken.

LAUNCHES NEW
WATER PROJECT
R. G. Hanford Interests
Eastern Syndicates
in Another Deal.-
Company Proposes to Supply
Cities and Furnish
Power.
R. G. Hanford. the mining operator of
this city, whose recent heavy transac
tions in the purchasing of local railroad
Interests for Eastern syndicates have
made him a prominent figure in
the financial world, has about com
pleted another project which, while
not as gigantic aa the last deal,
will bring to the promoter and his finan
cial associates a goodly income on their
Investments.
The plan is to develop a water supply
tor the lower bay counties and to pro
duce a certain amount of power which
will be delivered to San Francisco pat
rons.
A few months ago, and Just before
making his trip to the East to promote
the deal which resulted in the 126,000,000
transfer of the Market-street system, Mr.
Hanford acquired the drainage acreage of
some fifty square miles in Santa Clara
County.
The surrounding conditions appealed
to the experienced eye of the promoter,
and he was not long In devising a way to
put the tremendous waste to a paying ad
vantage. The property in question is sit
uated to the east and south of Mount
Hamilton and overlooks the fertile and
populous valley of Santa Clara. The site
commended Itself at once as one that
could be advantageously used for a supply
station for the surrounding towns, and
to bring the supply to the cities and set
tlements of the valley seemed to be a
comparatively inexpensive venture.
Power Can be Developed.
After a thorough study of the existing
conditions, Mr. Hanford concluded that
by transporting the water by flume some
twenty-five miles into the Santa Clara !
Valley an amount of water more than i
sufficient for the wants of the contiguous
country could be supplied and at a com
paratively small outlay.
Along tue flume route a fall of 1200 feet
can be arranged for, an advantage that
will greatly Increase the productive value
of the project.
On the route as laid out the greatest fall
will be at a point at the head of Cala
veras Valley, and at that place a plant
for the transmission of power will be
erected. The force to be generated here,
Mr. Hanford estimates, can be safely cal
culated at at least 3000 horsepower. A
small amount, the projector declares but
sufficient to bring in a revenue that will
pay a handsome interest on the money
Invested.
Long before plans for the project had
been fully completed Mr. Hanford ar
ranged to deliver to firms of this city
the entire amount of power supply and
has contracts to that effect.
With the power supply disposed of and
a profit already assured the water on
hand can be sold at a rate that can al
most defy competition.
The most conservative estimates of the
supply to be Impounded places the amount
at from 16.000.000 to 16.000.000 gallons flow
dally throughout the year.
Prospects for the sale of the water are
good in and about San Jose as soon as I
the project is an actual reality. The pres
ent water supply of San Jose Is not all I
that the people of that city desire. White
there Is no complaint aa to the quality
to be corporal of Company B, Private J
S. Rlley to be corporal of Company G.
Eighteen enlisted men have been dis
charged from the Fifth Infantry on ac
count of removalâ eleven for the good of i
the service, three by a two-thirds vote I
of the company and two at expiration of
term of service.
The second lecture before the First Ar
tillery Battalion delivered last week by
James W. Erwin. president of the Cali
fornia Camera Club, was on "Snapshots
in Japan China and the Philippines." It
waa an Interesting description of scenes
ln the countries named, illustrated with
many views. During the Intermission
Miss Lillian M. Quinn recited "Santiago"
In the cowboy dialect, it being a descrip
tion by one of Teddy's Rough Riders of
the fight at Ban Juan and the surrender
of Santiago.
The batteries of the First Artillery will
report for skirmish at the Presidio rifle
rang* on the l?th lnst.
The following promotions are an
nounced: Battery Aâ Corporals Gustav
Gambella. William H. Homer Jr. and
Kenneth A. Millken to be sergeants, and
Privates Charles J. O'Connor, David G.
Schloss and Henry C. Schwlnn to be cor
porals.
Eight men have been discharged from
the artillery battalion on account of re
moval, five for the good of the service and
one by a two-thirds vote.
A NEW ANNOUNCEMENT.
ONLY A PENNY
< To Get WelL .
I ask only a postal, statins; which book
you wish. No money Is wanted.
I want you to know how nerve power
alone operates each bodily function. If
some organ Is weak and fails in its duty
I want to tell you bow more nerve power
will correct it. I want yen to know, as I
do, that a permanent cure can come in no
other way. I have spent my lifetime on
this problem.
I will send with the book an order on
your nearest druggist for six bottles Dr.
Shoot's Restorative. Every drugglsr
keeps" It. I will ask you to accept the
Restorative and test It for a month. If It
cures, pay 15.50; if it falls it is free. I
will pay your druggist myself for it
This offer in five years has been ac-
cepted by 550,000 people. Practically all
of them had difficult troubles, long en-
dured. Most of them were discouraged.
Yet 39 out of 40 who received those six
bottles paid for them. They paid because
they were cured, for otherwise no drug-
gist asks a penny for it.
I cannot better prove my own faith in

Mild cases, not chronic, are often cured

ln summer the inhabitants are forced to
restrict themselves ln the use of the lite
sustaining liquid, owing to the shortness
of the supply. These conditions make it
easy for a new concern to bid success
fully to supply that city.
f2,500,000 Beady to be Expended.
While ln the East promulgating the sale
of the Market-street Cable Railroad Mr.
Hanford found time to submit his project
jto the men of money ln that section.
: Messrs. W. A. Otis & Co. of Colorado and
I Ohio considered the plan and after a care
i fill study at once decided to form a com
: pany.
Investors were easily obtained through
! this firm, as the members are well known
in the financial world as experts in water
supply projects. Before Mr. Hanford left
the ESast be was informed by his repre
sentatives that they had secured backing
to the extent of $3,500,000 for his enter
prise and that work could be commenced
at once after Mr. Hanford' a return to this
city.
A day or two ago Mr. Hanford put a
force of surveyors to work and as soon
as a report from them is forthcoming the
project will be begun in real earnest.
The company has decided to place itself
in communication with the City Council
of Oakland with a view toward obtairlng
the contract to supply that city. The
new concern feels that it can deliver
water to Oakland at a fair profit at a
rate at least 33 1-3 per cent cheaper than
any of iv competitors.
If the contract can be secured the com
pany proposes to lay pipes from the near
est point from its storage reservoir to the
outside city limits. This will necessarily
entail further cost, but the new company
declares itself ready to respond with a
further outlay of money to further the
scheme.
The plans of the new organization pro
vide for the erection. Immediately after
the survey has been completed, of a large
dam 125 feet in height and the building
of a reservoir that will have a circum
ference of eleven miles.
Survey to be Finished by March.
The survey, ir is estimated, will have
reached its completion by March 1 next,
and then gangs of men will be put to
work as fast as their labor can be used
advantgeously.
The company to a man has declared in
favor of pushing tne work to completion
as rapidly as possible, and it is expected
that by July 1, 1903, the project will have
been finished.
R. G. Hanford, through whose skillfui
manipulations the enterprise has been
brought to its present successful status,
has made a name for himself in the finan
cial world by his recent successful deals.
Only a few months ago he went East and
found purchasers for the San Mateo ro.-><|
of this city and concluded the transaction
satisfactorily tr all parties Interested.
Through his efforts a syndicate of Balti
more capitalist j was formed and the deal
promulgated i.i short order. Following
this transaction the transfer of the SutteV
street and Sutro lines was effecte-1
through Mr. Hanford, the same company
belnjr the purchaser.
The last successful deal to be carried
out through the clever engineering of the
skillful operator, and one that stands as
a record breaker in the way of large
money transactions, was the purchase for
$26,000,000 In actual cash of the great Mar
ket-street Railway Company of thto city.

Americans in Korea.
An Interesting account of mining In Ko
rea is given by the Mining and Scientific
Press. According to this there are only
two foreign companies carrying on min
ing In Korea. One of these Is an Ameri
can company, which has passed the pros
pecting stage and Is producing bullion
The mines operated by this company are
in the northern part of Ping Yang pro
vince, about 300 miles north from Seoul
and sixty-five ;nlles east from the walled
city of Wee Ju. which has guarded the
gate to China since the first settling of
Korea. Wee Ju Is on the Yalu River and
looks directly Into China. The American
gold quartz mines In that vicinity are
scattered among thrÂ«|e camps. Three
mills are in operation, one of forty
stamps and two of twenty stamps each.
One cyanide plant is in use and another
Is in course of construction.
The labor is all done by Chinese. Japa
nese and Koreans. Bach shift has a na
tive boss, who assists the American on
duty. Preparations are being made to In
stall a compressor to try machine drill
ing. The mine hoist engineers are all Ko
reans, who neÂ«d constant guidance. The
methods of milling do not differ mate
rially from those in the United States,
except that the amalgamator has all the
help he desires. Lumber and oak cord
wood are delivered to the mines by the
Koreans at the rate of $15 per thousand
and $2 26 per cord, respectively. The win

Editorially the Mining and Scientific
Press says:
Korea Is an exceedingly rich gold-bearing
country, measured by even the high standard of
comparison set by early day gold mining of
rallfornla. fc 1897 the Collector of Customs at
Oennsn. Kores. Informed the writer of this
that the placer gold production of the native
minersâ there was no production then from the
one foreign operation of mines Just startingâ
was over 14.000,000 a year, as Indicated by th*
exports of the metal that were registered at
the Custom-house. The Korean gold mining
and milling plants for gold quarts ores have
another distinction, the statement of which
will be somewhat of the nature of a surprfse.
Excepting only the gold quarts milling plants
In India, the Korean plants are the first to
be established In Asia. With all the ex
ploitation of Siberian placers tor a half *en
tury past there Is yet no gold Tjuart* milling
plant In that country, and no exploitation, as
dlntlngulxhed from prospecting of gold quarts
lodÂ»*. The first step made In Korea toward
modern mining business has skipped by all the
successive steps of slow advance which have
evolved gold mining practice, and has started
the latest and the best an the beginning. The
Governmental conditions surrounding the Indus
try In this new land are said to be satisfac
tory. There Is an absence of the fussy official
ism and official exploitation of foreign capital
that Invests In mined that has made the estab
lishment of American gold mining practice
unlng either Russian or foreign capital a fail
ure In Siberia. The Korean Government and
people have, fortunately for their own mate
rial Interests, encouraged and permitted the
American miners, who are using American cap
ital to exploit their gold mines, to apply with
out restriction American mining practice.
Hydraulicklng In Oregon.
A correspondent of the Mining and En
gineering Review, who has Just returned
lrorr. an Inspection of the mining country
in Bout hern Oregon, writes that there are
scores of hydraulic mines In the southern
portion of Josephine County that have
abundant water to run four or five months
each year. The working grounds consist
of a loose gray and red gravel, lying from
twenty to seventy-flve feet on the bed
rock and rich In coarse gold. The cost
of working a mine, after a mine is
equipped in that district, is estimated at
5 cents per cubic yard.
The Marlposa Gazette reports that work
on the Pocanontas copper mine has been
Biinpended. A rich strike Is reported at

EXPANDING MARKET OFFERS HOPE TO OWNERS OF OIL
WELLS AND PRODUCT IS BRINGING HIGHER PRICES
Only elgrhty-four oil wells were com
pleted In the California fields) during the
six months ending October 31 of the pres
ent year. In the same time there were
ten failures to ttnd oil. At the end of Oc
tober 463 wells were being drilled. These
figures summarize a long report In the Los
Angeles Herald, which makes a ipeclalty
of the statistics of the California oil in
dustry. There was an Increase in the
rigs and In the number of drilling wells.
The market for oil is extending contin
ually. There are many facts pointing to
that conclusion. In the course of its re
cent review the Herald makes the follow
ing points In that regard:
With a constantly Increasing production it is
essential that there be also an expanding mar
ket for the product, and that the one keÂ«p
pace with the other. If this hat not been the
condition heretofore It has been on account
only of the newness of the oil Industry and the
delays necessarily Incident to a readaptatlon of
Industrial conditions to the new order. In San
FranclÃco two years ago less than 1000 barrels
of oil were being used In a year for fuel pur
poses, while to-day there are being used over
1,000,000 barrels, and with a constantly Increas
ing demand. The railroads will use during the
present year about 4,000,000 harries, and the
eleven refineries operating In the state at the
present time will use about 1,500,000 barrels.
The actual requirements for the entire State
this year are placed at over 7,000,000 barrels. In
view of these statistics there Is not only room
for encouragement, but the Immensity of the
possibilities opening out to the oil Industry be
comes apparent.
The price of oil has stiffened considera
bly. Contracts at low figures have been
surrendered in somÂ« instances that long
time contracts might be made, the con
sumers being the* movers and acting evi
dently under the supposition that there
will be higher prices in the future than
there aro now. Tho future is largely in
the hands of the Kern County combine
so far as making money for the producers
is concerned. During the last week the
Crude Oil Company joined the Associated
Oil Company, more than two-t ilrds of
the stockholders voting in favor of this
action, and there was no opposition.
The conditions are that thÂ» company
shall deed its real estate and personal
property to the Associated Oil Company,
contingent upon the taking of similar ac
tion by other specified corporations, the
number including San Joaquln. Whlttler
& Oreen, the Canfleld and the Kern com
panies. These must deposit their deeds
In escrow with the Union Trust Company
of Han Francisco by January 1, 1902. to
meet the situation. All companies enter
ing the combine will receive stock in the
Associated Oil Company. The basis of
the agreement has already been published
in The Call.
The lrrlgatora of Kern County axe
alarmed lest the oil in the sump holes
and reservoirs of Kern County should be
turned into the Kern River by the heavy
rains of the winter. X circular letter has
been issued by half a dozen canal and Ir
rigating companies in wnich the oil well
men are notified that unless steps are
taken to prevent the waste oil from get
ting into Kern River or any of the canals
taking water from the river they will go
to the courts to protect their Interests.

EMILIO DE MARCHI. GRAU'S CELEbRATED NEW ITALIAN TENOR.
WHO WILL APPEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS CITY ON
WEDNESDAY EVENING IN 'LA TRAVIATA."
WELL, there Is nothing to say this
week but that we have almost
everything musical in sight at
our doors for the remainder of
the month and more. The moun
tain has come to Mahomet, and Instead of
it* being imperative on the opera wor
shiper to take a ticket to New York to
hear his 'â¢Tristan and Isolde." Tristan
and Itolde have come to San Francisco |
and will sing their wondrous story of love
to us here. It seems almost too good to
be true, yet to-morrow night the Grau
grand opera season is announced to begin
with "Lohengrin." Mr. Grau rates us as
an opera-loving population only next to
New York, and certainly he gives us here
the longest season outside of Gotham.
Th* impresario is saying a good deal Just
at present about the dangers and difficul
ties of the long trip across the continent,
but. from all appearances, the tangible
appreciation of his efTorts this reason Is
likely to outweigh far more serious con
siderations cf that kind than the trials of
a Journey from New York to San Fran
cisco. I should not like to wager much
that Mr. Grau docs not come out next
year with Jean de Re.-zke as a special
drawir.p card. As he saysÂ». though, he
can hardly offer us more than the pres
ent programme contains either in the way
of novelty of opera, or singer. We shall
simply have heard almost all the best
operas and world-famous artists at the '
end of the present season.
"Lohengrin" will be the opening per
formance, and the role of Elsa Will be
sung by Emma Esraes. who has never ap
peared in this city, although her fame has
already preceded her. The full cast for
the opera will be as follows:
Ela& yon Brabant. Mm*. Emma EamÂ»s; Or
trnd. MmÂ«. Schumajin-Helnk; Lohengrin. Mr.
Van Dyck: Fr.w>rleh yon Telramund. Bra

"I>s Husrufnot> ' will be made attrac

The opportunely to hear Mmes. Gadski,
Louis*- Homer and Sembrich and Messrs.

will be sung, and Marcella Sembrich will
return to us in one of her best roles. She
wtll have as one of her associates Emlllo
de Marchl, the famous Italian tenor. Ver
di's opera will be Interpreted by the fol
lowing list of distinguished artists:

"Tannhaueer," on Thursday evening,
will introduce a new artist In the person
of Louise Reuss-Belce. She is well known
In Germany, where ehe has appeared suc
cessfully at several of the Bayreuth fes
tlvals. The cast selected for the opera
may be said to be an ideal one. It follows: ,
Elisabeth, line. "mmÂ» Earner: Kin Hlrt,
MiM C&rrte Bridewell; VenuÂ«. Mine. Iviulh.
ReÂ«M-BelcÂ«; TannhauÂ»er, M. Van Dyck; Her

Heinrich. M. Reiu; Blt;roJf. M. Muhlmann:
Kelnmar, M. Virlanl; Wolfram, Mr. Bli*i>hain;
conductor. Waiter Damrosch.
Emma Calve will make her debut here
in "Carmen" on Friday evening. Bizet's
heroine has become more or less identified
with the famous French prlma donna and
the expectation aroused by her first ap
pearance here Is not likely to be disap
pointed. The opera will be sung with the
following cast: - v
Carmen, Hme. Calve; Frasqult*. Mini Bauer
meister; ' Mercedes, Mme. Van Cauteren;
Mlcaela, Mme. Suzanne A Cam-; Dot) Jose. M.
Halicnac; Sanies. M. Journet; Morale*,
Jacques Bar*; Daocalro. M. nutrient; HÂ»m
endado. M. Relax; Eacamlllo, M. Scottl; con
ductor. M. Flon.
Emma Calve will demonstrate that she
is not an artist' with only one role by
appearing in "Faust" on Saturday after
noon. It was in the role of Marguerite
that she made her first appearance on tno
operatic stage. "Faust" will be sung with
the following cast:
Marsaerlta, Mme. Calve; Marts, Mies
reicirter; ti.W. Mm*. LouUe Homer, I
Faurt. M. IMppe!. Valentin, M. Campanar!:
Waimer. M. Dufrlche; MÂ»phistophelea, Ed de
iMkÂ»; conductor, M. Serpltll.
On Saturday evening Sibyl Sanderson
will make her first appearance here in
"Manon." She has sung the role nearly
three hundred times in Europe and was
declared by the composer to be his Ideal
of the role. The opera is founded on Abbe
Provost famous tale and the music Is
generally conceded to be the best work of
Massenet's. The cast will include:
Van on Lescaut, Mme. Sybil Sanderson;
Pousette. Mme. Mary 111; Javctte. Miss Carrie
Bridewell; Rosette. Mme. Van Cauteren ; Lek
caut. M. Declery; Le Comte dcs Grieuz. M.
Journet: Galliot. M. Gtllbert: De Bretlmy. M.
Bars; Ie Chevalier dcs Grieuz. M. Sallrnae;
conductor. M. Flon.
Very few of the operas will be repeated
during the engagement of the Maurice
Grau Company. Among the novelfies to
be siven may be mentioned Wagner's "Die
Meistersinger" and "Tristan and Isolde"
and Mozart* "The Marriage of Figaro."
Mr. Grau will again make a feature of
performances on Sunday evenings at pop
ular prices. The advance sale indicates
a proFperous season.

Charles Hoffmann, tenor, who descend
ed upon San Francisco last Friday at a
son? recital at Sherman & Clay Hall,
sp*ms to me to be of the strictly super
fluous class so far as music is concerned.
We may be a long way off from thing*
here, but not quite far enough to make
Mr. Hoffmann a possibility as a vocalist.
His programme announces the singer as
a pupil of the "celebrated tenor, Theodor
Wachtel, and of Mme. Marches!," who
may. of course, have done something to
deserve the imputation, though Mr. Hoff
mann's methods indicate a noble freedom
from educational trammels of any sort.
One would rather like to know, however,
to which of the two famous teacher*
should be ascribed, trie explosive nuance
in which Mr. Hoffman Indicates the senti
mental side of things, and to whose inspi
ration he owes the naive falsetto which,
with this artless German, takes the place
of the conventional tenor's high note.
We must have a pretty rough rcputatlo.l
somewhere for Mr. Hoffmann to imagine
that we could accept the kind of thin*, he
has to after for the glorious art of sing
ing, but the exhibition was perhaps murÂ«
amu?!n? than impertinent. It Is under

a pianist. Let De PachoMUÃl and Paste*

OUR Government is keeping close watch on the Monroe hemisphere. In the old sailing
days all navies were on an equality. The winds blow all around the globe, and no
country could corner their motive power. Now it is different. A country that follows its
trade with its navy must have coaling stations which it can command in war. In peace
every port is a coaling station, but in war it is different. We wete in a hard place when Dewey's
fleet had to sail from Hongkong within a given time, after war was declared against Spain. We
had not access to a pound of coal nearer than Honolulu, and there only because the dummy re
public of Hawaii could safely violate neutrality under our protection. Our Asiatic fleet was in
danger of cold boilers until Dewey hammered his way to access to the Spanish coal pile at Cavite.
Because of the necessity for coaling stations the English navy is the strongest in the w jrld,
independently of the number of its ships, gun and men. It would still be the strongest if these were
reduced by a third, because Great Britain has coal piles everywhere under her own flag. We are
deficient in that respect. On the Pacific Coast we have only one coaling station outside our own
' territory, and that is inconveniently located on the coast of Mexico. Germany is alive to the situa
tion, and is seeking indirectly to invade our hemisphere, and through one of her chartered steam
ship companies to acquire territory for a coaling station which will command the Caribbean Sea.
German trade is considerable in Central and South America, but the coveted coaling station is not
wanted so much on account of existing trade as for the purpose of getting warships with bunkers
full of coal within striking distance of the isthmian canal. Anyway that is the view taken of it by
our Government, and the Monroe doctrine will be applied to the affair. A war with Germany is a
very remote contingency. The two nations have more trade with each other than cither enjoys
with the other Americas, and would lose the greater in a battle for the less. But precedent is of
importance to the United States. If we permit the direct or indirect cession of territory for conling
and naval station purposes to one foreign nation we could hardly refuse it to any other. So the
way to get out of trouble in that respect is to keep out of it now, and inform any of the small
countries that have erected statues to Monroe that they must live up to his doctrine.
While we are watching the Caribbean Sea it may be well to keep an eye on the Pacific
Coast. Chile is suspected of nmbitious designs, and is known to be seeking naval stations in Cen
tral America within striking distance of this end of the canal. That is a truculent country, juite
self-possessed and confident of its power, with very ambitious commercial schemes, and, as fnr as
its production and commerce go, a strong rival of California. A visitor to the Pan-American fair
was struck by the similarity of the Chilean and California exhibits. The productions of the two coun
tries are common and not complementary. We are out for the same trade, and our warships near
the canal should not be compelled to coal only by permission of the Chilean navy.
THE LIVESTOCK JMLJSXT.
THE National Livestock Association is sending out statements of its expected action daring
its annual meeting in Chicago. Some of these are significant of its change of sentiment on
the subject of leasing the arid grazing lands on the public domain. In its meeting two
years ago at Fort Worth this association by a narrow majority favored the leasing of Ihese
lands. As this was accomplished by the vote of the Texas delegation* the anti-leasers denounced
it, because the United States owns no public domain in Texas, and it was claimed, therefore, that
the delegates'from that State had no right to vote on an issue that did not concern them. To the
annual meeting last January in Salt Lake City the anti-leasers came in force to repeal the Fort
Worth decision. They dominated the convention, but were restrained from the intended repeal by
the prospect that it would disrupt the association. Therefore they were obliged to content them
selves with tabling the report of the leading committee.
At that time the anti-leasers were practically all sheep men and the issue was really between
them and the cattle men. The latter, in view of the imminence c* the extinction of their business by
being driven from the free public range by the sheep wen. while retaining their individual mem
bership in the Livestock Association, proceeded to organize the American Cattle-Growers' Asso
ciation, which immediately acquired a large membership, so that its convention in Denver in the
spring was largely attended, :\nd voted by a great majority to proceed at once with the leasing
policy. Cireat progress has been made therein, and during the summer the cattle interest has prac
tically consolidated in favor of such a law, and a large nambei of sheep men have abandoned the
anti-leasers and joined the leasers. This probably accounts for the appearance of change in the
Livestock Association, for it is now apparent that, excluding Texas, a majority of that body favors
leasing.
In the last outgiving from Denver appears the usual sign of a surrender. It is announced
that the meeting at Chicago will consider the appointment of a Congressional committee to in
vestigate the subject, but the same telegram admits every premise of the leasers. Therein the Live
stock Association admits that over-stocking the free range is rapidly destroying its forage, and as
rapidly decreasing all kinds of stock. We called attention to this last year when the price of beef
permanently advanced as a result of a falling off of 60 per cent in the receipt of range cattle at the
slaughtering centers in the preceding five years. Not only is the meat supply diminishing, but the
arid region is being made more arid and less possible of settlement by the homesteader through a
decline in the flow, of springs and streams.
The American Cattle-Growers' Association did not wait for the conversion of the Live
stock Association, but proceeded by its committee to draft a lease bill, which will be submitted to.
Congress in the coming session. \s the premise of the cattlemen is admitted, they see no utility in
delaying the conclusion by appealing to a Congressional commission. That commission could only
report in favor of leaving the range to be destroyed as commons, or that all the public domain be
ceded to the States and Territories, or that it be leased and left open to the homesteader and
mineral entry man. As the first would be intolerable to both associations, and the second is im
practicable, for the Federal Government will never code its domain and lose control of its forest res
ervations and its right to protect t!-e intending settler, the commission could satisfy Western sen
timent only by recommending leasing. Hut by the time it acted the flocks and herds will have
nearly disappeared with the forage and the desert will dominate the range.
The cattlemen seem Indisposed to wait that long, and. as their premise is admitted by the
Livestock Association, they will invite it to join them in reaching the conclusion now. while
some of the range is left. It is an issue intensely important to the West, and its determination
should not be delayed until beef disappears as the ordinary food of our people and as an im
portant feature in our export trade. .â
BO:iSÂ£B.A.*RIDIITGr HAILSTORMS.
DESPITE the reports of American Consuls concerning the success alleged to have been
attained in certain parts of France, Italy and Austria by the use of cannonading for the
purpose of breaking up approaching hailstorms, Professor Moore of the
Bureau officially declares the whole thing to be incredible.
Referring to the experiments mad/in Europe the Professor says: "Several thousand shoot
ing stations have been established in Italy and France during the past few years, but reports re
ceived from them give no definite data in support of the state of the experiments, although there
is no doubt, that the cannonading is believed to be effectual by the farmers who do the work
Waves of irrational enthusiasm sometimes creep over a community only to be regretted in subse
quent years, when calmer judgment has come to prevail. We have only to remember the experi
ence of our own country only a few years ago with the rainmakers, and how firm was the belief ot
thousands of people in the sub-arid and arid regions of the West that the use of powerful explosives
would produce rainfall."
It is pointed out that the practice is irrational because while not one storm in a hundred has
hail, there is no way of telling bysight at a distance whether the approaching cloud is going to
bring hail or not, and consequently the farmers who resort to cannonading to keep off hailstorms
would have to waste a great deal of money in unnecessary bombardments. Finally the Professor
says: "The great processes going on in the atmosphere are conducted on too large a scale for any
man or any nation to attempt to control them. The energy expended by nature in the produc
tion of a hailstorm, a tornado or a rainstorm probably exceeds the combined energy of all the
steam engines and explosives in the world."
It is hard to cure a popular delusion, and we shall dpubtless hear of attempts in this country
to imitate the French experiments. It is, therefore, well that Professor Moore has issued his warn
ing against the folly. If we have any powder to shoot away let us save it for the Fourth pf July.

i a living lyric drama that approximates in

i cient Greece, both in Its origin and devel

! vastly significant fact should have here-
I tofore remained unnoted by any of the
I Orientalists. With the exception of a
| short talk some time ago at Columbia
| University by Mr. Fenollosa himself and
I a single chapter on the "No" (the clas
i sicat drama) In a book on Japan by El
ward Austin, the subject has so far Inex-
ably been irnorcd by students of the
Far East. It Id perhaps as well, for It Is
not easy to Imagine another so profound
ly intimate knowledge and sympathy, a*
that of Mr. FenoMosa being brought to
.bear, on the subjectâ exactly that quality
of knowledge. lÂ»y the way. that is vitally
necessary to us as a people in our future I

! neighbors, and particularly to California '
; he it said.
,'â¢'â¢"Â¦â¢ - -
The subject of the Japanese classical
> drama Is one of which Mr. Fenollos* Is
! peculiarly well qualified to speak. He had,
the . advantage of studying Its technique
' and history for many years with the lead
ing actor of the "No," Umewaka Minor
who also restored the classical drama aft
er Its threatened extinction in the his
toric upheaval of IS6B.
Like the Greek drama, the "No" had Its
origin in a religious -danceâ the dance of
the Shinto godsâ though the Japanese
classical drama dates back only some 45)
years. Also, as in the Greek drama,
masks are used, some 300 masks being re
quired for the 200 plays to which the orig
inal 600 lyric dramas have been sifted i
. down. The masks are. symbolic of thÂ« I
leit-motif, .so to speak, of the character, j
and In the hands of a good actor seem
actually to change expression with each
passing emotion.
Different masks may bo used during
the progress of the play, as when the
mask of a * Jealous woman, of a dull,
bricky red in one act, with short horns
and sharp teeth, becomes in the next of
a fearful Jaundiced yellow, : with long
horns ' and long sharp fangs. There !
is a chorus, too, that though ii
does not dance, yet performs the same
explanatory part that the Greek 'chorus
performed, , emphasising, defining, fore
shadowing the dramatic > significance ot
the moment, all in a musical chant that
I Is most like the old Sanscrit chants of any
of the world songs that . are known to
us. â¢ It Is also an exquisitely picturesque
adjunct, the costumes being a magnificent
mass of lovely color and inspired harmony
of line. " . - â¢>Â¦
At first purely a religious festival per
formed by the priests, stories of ancient
chivalries, like our own Arthurian cycle,
began afterward to appear. Gods, at
first the only "leading men" in the plays,
began to give way to mortals, and to-day
a composite cast -of gods and men takes
part In the perfected drama. Three Jap
anese Shakespeares, or Sophoclesâ as one
Tikes to put itâ are responsible : for the
whole two Â¦ hundred plays that form the
classical repertoire; and it is ' most Inter
esting to note that many of the actors
now taking part |n these dramas are
lineal " , descendants â¢-" of â¢ those - old play
wrights. It Is of a piece with that glori
ous madness for art that la the. last thing
one thinks of in connection with present
day ; acclAantai drama that ' the humblest

as an apostolate. He Is trained from ear

And of the plays that have so vital hold

than any other occidental playwright, has
approached the mystic symbolism of the
classical Japanese genius, though curious

same time with noble knights (samurai >.
priests, poets, artists, beautiful women
and other mortals. As may be seen from
the dramatis personae. the plays deal
largely with subjective realities, and their

"How are the American young women
progressing in musical studies In Paris?"
was asked of the singer.
â¢They are not making much progress,
I am sorry to say," responded the diva,
sadly. "Very few debuts have been made
there since l made mine. The trouble Is
that many of our American women are
often deceived as to tha talent for music
which they believe themselves to possess.
The result Is grievous disappointments,
and many girls, whose hopes of making
a stir in the musical world will never be
realized, are pursuing their fruitless work
with aching hearts. People should not
hold on to impossible Ideals, for this
means sorrow and care and endless tribu

Tivoli Management and the Pollard
Company Sued for Violation of
Schubert's Copyright.
Samuel 8. Schubert of New York fllel
a suit yesterday morning In the United
States Circuit Court against the Pollard
Juvenile Company and the management
of the Tlvoll Opera-house for an Injunc
tion to restrain them from performing
the "Belle of New York" in the United
Stated and for an accounting of the pro
fits of last week's business and damages
for violation of copyright.
Schubert alleges that he purchased the
copyright from Hugh Morton and Ous
tave Kerker of New York for the exclu
sive right of production in the United
States. The copyright for Australia ana
the other Pacific colonies Is held by the
George Lederer Amusement Company.
The Pollard company claims that It pur
chased the right from the Lederer com
pany to play the opera in the United
States, but Schubert claims that Ledere<*
could not sell what did not belong to
him. Judge Morrow will hear the case
on Monday.
Schubert's attorneys are P. I. Manson
and Lucius L. Solomons.
Street Cars in Collision.
What might have been a very serious
collision occurred on the corner of Steuart
and Folsom streets yesterday afternoon.
It was Just at the time when the crowd
was bound out to the football game, but
luckily it was an Inbound San Mateo car
and not a crowded outbound one that was
In the trouble.
Car No. 68 of the Ban Mateo line had
been out at Recreation Park with a
crowd of passengers and was on Its way
back to the ferric& Coming down the
Harrifton-street hill it began to slip on
the wet track and the motorman had to
let It coma into East street at fast speed.
While Car No. 68 was speeding along to
wn rd the Folsom-street crossing car No.
1018 of the Folsom-street line came around
the curve from the ferries. Both motor
men saw the danger and attempted to
stop the cars, but failed, owing to the
state of the tracks. The consequence was
that the San Mateo car crashed Into the
Folsom-street car and nearly wrecked It.
Traffic was blocked for more than an
hour, but finally the disabled car was got
out of the way and sent to the repair
shop. _
Charged With Burglary.
Arthur Streeter, who says he Is an ex

GUARDS ARREST
MORE CONVICTS
Men Who Escaped From
Leavenworth Prison
Captured.
Hunger Drives One Shackled
Fugitive From His
Cover.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 9.â Armed
guards, aided at many points by farmers,
to-day kept up an unceasing search in the
woods and on the highways in the country
between Leavenworth, Kansas City and
the Kansas River for the convicts fleeing
from the Federal Prison at Fort Leaven
worth. As a result of the days work
threa prisoners were taken, unharmed.
Thla makes a total of twelve captured
thus far, leaving fourteen still at large.
The men taken to-day were: Gus Parker
and David Grayson,. white prisoners sent
up for rive years each for burglary and
larceny, who -were captured three miles
north of Lawrence, Kan., and James Wil
son, colored, also a five-year larceny con
vidt, who was arrested on the outskirts
of i-tavenworth still wearing hlB shackles.
Frank Thompson, the negro leader and
originator of the outbreak, was reported
wounded and captured south of Tonga- j
hoxle, Kan., but this report Is believed to
be v.ntrue.
Surrenders When Hungry.
Wilson was found two miles out from
tho business district of Leavenworth this
morning. He had been hiding in the woods
since Wednesday afternoon, unable to
travel fast because of his shackles, and
was forced from cover by hunger. Par
ker and Grayson were encountered on the
railroad track at Midland, Kan., this even-
Ing by Dave Lewis, a farmer. Parker
carried a revolver but threw It away and
both surrendered meekly and permitted
l.i wis to lead them Into Lawrence.
Three parties of deputies that went out
during the day to locate different batches
of convicts supposed to be surrounded by
farmers, two going from Lawrence and
one from Leavenworth, returned at dark
empty handed. It is believed that the four
teen convicts still at liberty have broken
up into twos and three and scattered to
avoid attracting attention, and thus may
aid them In getting away. It is now pos
sible that some of them may get Into the
Indian Territory before morning.
Grave Charges Await Them.
As fast as the men are captured they
are returned . to the penitentiary and
placed in solitary confinement. When the
condition of the guards shot at the out
break is finally determined the convicts
will be charged with the added crime or
conspiring to kill their guards and possibly
with murder if that charge can be placeu
properly. The dead bodies of Qulnn. Huff
man and Poffenholz will be buried in the
prison grounds.
YVAMEGO, Kan., Nov. 9.â Three of the
escaped Federal convicts held up William
Coder, a farmer, about two miles south
of town this evening at 6 o'clock and
robbed him of his horse and buggy and
most of his clothing. Coder was returning
home from a day's marketing. After the
robbery the men drove rapidly toward the
southeast. One of them left his trousers
behind and they contained the number 24.
A largÂ« posse in now In pursuit.

TONGS SETTLE
ALL TROUBLES
All the troubles between the Chin and
Wong families arising out of the murder
of the lookout in Bock Oye's gambling
place a few nUhts ago were settled last
night. When the watchman was killed
the Chin family declared that the mur
derer must be given up to justice or the
lives of five members of the rival family
would be taken.
The feeling Letween the two families
was intensified later by an assault made
upon the wife of Leong Kee at 622 Dupont
street. Although Detectives Ed Glbsor
and George McMahon were detailed upon
the cases they were unable to find any
clew to the peipetrators of the outrages
In order to prevent trouble between the
two factions special officers were detailed
In clt (sen's clothes to watch the district.
A meeting of the two factions was held
last night at the headquarters of the
Chin family, on Washington street. It
lasted more than four hours, and the
hatchet was effectively burled. "What the
terms of the settlement were neither side
would say. but it was evidently satisfac
tory, as a banquet held in an adjoining
restaurant gave evidence. Both sides
pledged fealty to each other In copious
draughts of sam-shu.
As soon as the news was conveyed to
police headquarters orders were given by
acting Chief of Police Wlttman to with
draw the detectives and the special squad.

PRESIDENT WILL
URGE CHANGES
CHICAGO. Nor. 9. -The Record
to-morrow will say:
In his message to Congress President
Roosevelt will incorporate several radical
recommendations regarding thm Interstate)
Commerce. Commission and will probably
urge the passage of remedial legislation
which will place the commission In a po
sition to become a power for good In tad
traffic world. Concerning us mattes
Chairman Knapp of the commission, said:
I am reliably Informed that th* President
will treat of the commission Is -his mmvi
and will make some recommendation* to Con
gress that will enable the commission to do
that wblch the law that created it Intended
it should accomplish. There has been bo official
communication between the President and the
commission and I do not want to be understood
as going any further In my . statement than
that I have been told by reliable authorities
that such Is the President's purpose. - I know
that he Is very much Interested in thai subject
and I believe that he la in favor of ttriam the)
commission more power than it now possesses.
The essential facts secured by the In
vestigation which closed to-day are that
railroads east and west cut export rates
constantly and do not publish their ex
port rates; that a condition exists In the
Central Freight Association which mor
ally proves that the roads eastbound from
Chicago are pooling on grain and grain
products; that the cut rates in exports
are due largely to the competition, of
water routes, which are not under the su
pervision of the commission:, that the
bulk of grain for domestic use moves as
export grain, thereby being granted, a
cut rate; that a substantial discrepancy
exists between the rates on grain and
flour, and that hay is a classification
higher than kindred products.

Brilliant Record Is Made by
Society Leaders in the
Doll Show.
THE big doll show is over. It fin
ished up last night in a wonderful
burst of glory with all society look
ing on and applauding, and the
Doctor's Daughters elated at the
prospect of a well filled exchequer.
This combinationâ vaudeville and doll
showâ was quite the biggest thing ever
attempted ln an amateur way ln this city,
and its success was immediate and un
qualified.
The rain that came down ln bucketfuls
last evening had no terrors for the many
who had arranged to go to the show. All
the box holders braved the storm and the
fair ones came out in costumes that were
at once the wonder and admiration of
their escorts.
Pretty heads were covered with Jaunty
hats laden down with exquisite plumes,
and it looked as though there was no 6uch
terrible calamity possible as the damp
ness taking the curl out of a feather.
In tfce body of the house there were
a very few empty seats, but that was
rather pleasant than otherwise. It per
mitted some of the hard-worked D. t>.'s
to sit down and enjoy that which they
had planned for the enjoyment of others.
This was a privilege that the tremendous
crowd of the previous night did not al
low. As on the opening night, the Floro
dora sextet was the sensation of the
evening's entertainment. It went. If any
thing, better than on the first evening.
j 'The "pretty maidens" no longer suffered
I from the very slight attack of stage fright
i that embarrassed them on Friday even
ing, and the gentle strangers seemed to
have cawght. som*- of that command of
i spirit that made Frank Rudolph, the star
of the sextet. All in all. the chorus went
even better than it did before, the strang
ers were Jollier and the maidens more
coouetti!>h and artfully coy.
During the <-onvf-nient ten minutes' In
termission the au<lk-r.ce went visiting' from
box to box or wandered out in the lobby
and mad'- plad the hearts of the pretty
maids that h<-!pe<l Mrs. Wakefleltl Baker
at the refreshment booth. They also went
i a -fishing and caught all that there was In
the fish pond. In fact when the doors ot
â¢ the big show r-loscd there was not one doll
j left on th* doll table, not one "fish" in
the pond r.or a "grab" in the bag.
Raffle Necessarily Postponed.
It was Intended that the magnificent doll
house donated by the Misses Grace and
Lillian Spreckels should be raffled off af
ter the evening's programme was exhaust
ed, but fifty tickets that could not be
accounted forâ tickets that some D. D.
had taken to sell outside the showâ made
the postponement of the raffle necessary.
Mlts Grace Spreckels, radiant in a pale
embroidered yellow chiffon gown, stood
valiantly at her post beside the wondrous
doll house p.ll evening and sold raffle tick
ets. The young lady was down to her
last hundrc-d tickets when Thomas H.
TRIAL OF A CASE
IN THE WOODS
Curious Feature of a
Murder Inquiry in
Missouri.
GALENA, Mo., Nov. 9.â James Crab
tree, charged with complicity in the mur
der last June- of Alice Btailions. a young
girl, was to-dfcy found guilty and his sen
tence was fixed at ten years in the peni
tentiary. Mrs. Thomas Crabtree, the
prisoner's stepmother, and xhomai Crab
tree and his son William are still to be
tried for complicity in the crime.
Alice Stallions, the victim, was the 16
year-old stepdaughter of Thomas Crab
tree. Bhe had trouble with her folks be
cause she permitted the attentions of a
neighboring farmer whom they disliked.
Later the body of the girl was found
floating In the James River with the neck
broken and bearing other marks of ill
usage. It was charged that her half
brothers had assaulted and then helped
to murder her. The affair created a sen
sation and there was talk of lynching tha
quartet.

Williams Jr. marched up to her and satd:
"Any tickets not disposed of, Miss
Spreckels?"
"Why. yes," said the lady; "there axe
about â "
"Never mind the number," said Will
iams. "I'll take them all."
One thousand tickets in all have been
disposed of for the house raffle, and the
Doctor's Darghters will be $500 the richer
for the splendid doll's mansion.
Whoever is fortunate enough to win the
house will have with it the best samples
of the work of Reid Brothers, architects,
who designed the house; Kruker. who
bullded the house and. by the way, do
nated it: Sloane, who laid the carpets
and hung the draperies; Clark, who pa

the beautiful white- bear rug that covers
the inlaid reception room floor.
The three dolls that were raffled off
were won as follows: Miss Bodelle, the

Kate May Dillon, and Miss Lurllne Mat-

took him to Captain Seymour and he per
sisted that he had been robbed and that
the lady who was with him had given up
her Jewels to the robber. He declined to
nay who she was. He was taken to tho
City Prison and was shown James H.
Kelly, who was arrested after the rob
bery on suspicion, and declared he was
the man, although he had worn a mask.
The only thing against Kelly besides
Brockway's statement Is that he had a
piece of canvas concealed under his vest
when arrested which might have been

better mall facilities Uua t&ey now en-
Joy. Their daily mall comet by stage
route, and the condition* are such toat
they are not served nearly as well as
they might be. The star rout* over woicii
their mail matter travels Is pronounced
by those who know to be the most im
portant of any in the United titates. The
contract will soon be let again. Tbs
present indications are tnat to* postal
authorities at Washington wiu be xc
quested to make certain restrictions when
the specifications are drawn up. Tha
route is now from Ukiah to Scotia. Under
an arrangement with the Pacific Lumber
Company passengers and freight will bÂ»
carried on the company's trains, and nine
miles of the worst part of the stage road
beyond Pepperwood will be cut off.
The near completion of the tracks of
the Northwestern road to Wllletts from
Ukiah will cut off another twenty-four
miles. Still there will be more than 100
miles of staging through a country
abounding ln water courses, many of
which are without bridges, and the rains
ln winter time are very heavy. While
the cut-offs mentioned will reduce tne
time for the transportation of the malls
by stage, there are other conditions of
which the people are loudly and with a
strong show of Justice complaining.
The mail pouches travel in wagons that
permit them to be exposed to the Inclem
ency of the weather. They frequently are
wet through and letters are reduced to a
pulpy condition, that is very unsatisfac
tory. Eureka, Arcata and other commu
nities have only the stage route to bring
them daily malls, the steamer service
averaging only one delivery in every two
and one-half days. The people now wish
the Postofflce Department to provide that
the malls on their routes shall be carried
ln fit wagons, so built that the letters and
papers shall have protection from the
weather.
They say that there should be employed
regular mall wagons, vehicles cov
ered with Iron screens and locked,
so that no one can gain accejj
to them except the. Postmasters
along the route. They also ask that
the mall and the passenger and freight
service shall be distinct. The stages that
carry the mall, they say. should not
transport passengers or freight. To give
them the proper speed ln transit they
should have four horses for every part of
the road. The new contract for four
years will be let within the next thirty
days, which makes the matter one ot ur
gency.

Prosecution of the Man Who Was Con

California Packing Company Is Unlikely
EX-SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIA PACKING COMPANY, WHO FLED
WHEN THE CORPORATION FAILED AND WHO SURRENDERED
YESTERDAY TO THE POLICE.
HARLES J. KING, the former sec
(l retary of the Pacific Vinegar and
(I . Pickle Works and the California
Packing Company, who fled from
San Francisco In April. 1900. fol
lowing the collapse of the latter corpo
ration, and for whose arrest warrants
were issued at that time, surrendered him
self yesterday to Detective Tom Gibson
at police headquarters.
The charge for which King was wanted
was based on a complaint sworn to by
Frederick Scbumacker, assistant secre
tary of the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle
Company, in which King was accused of
stealing $350. The warrant was Issued on
April 24, 1900, but when the police officers
went to King's residence he was missing.
Yesterday Attorney Henry E. Hlghton.
accompanied by King, called at police
headquarters and King gave himself Into
custody. He gave cash bail in the sum
of $100, the amount fixed by Judge Ca
baniss when the warrant was issued, and
was soon at liberty.
The reappearance in this city of King
recalls a sensational failure In business
circles early last year.
King, who was the son of James King
of William, the noted pioneer, who was
killed by James Casey, who, In turn, was
hanged by tne Vigilantes, was prominent
in business, social and church circles, lie
was secretary ot the Pacific Vinegar and
Pickle Works and also of the California
Packing Company. The former organiza
tion dominated the California Packing
Company ana supplied it with material
and encouraged It in trade.
EllÂ© J. Cote was president of the Cali
fornia Packing Company, while Sidney M.
bmith was president Of thÂ« Pacific Vine
gar and PicKle Works. On April 20, IsOO.
the business community was wtartled by
the news that the California Packing
Company had railed, being unable to meet
a demand for *2WJ. Charges of fraud and
conspiracy soon nlle<i me air, and an in
vestigation of the affair* of the two cor
porations developed an amazing state of
affairs.
Make Contradictory Statements.
The creditors of the California Packing
Company had the books exported ajnd v
was found mat the company owed -v. large
sum of money to the Pacific Vinegar ana
Pickle Work.-. The men at the head ot
the corporation contradicted â¢ each other
as to the amount of the Indebtedness. The
figures showing the indebtedness varied
from $30,000 to Ki.OO'J, but the experts final
ly decided on $24,000 as the amount, 'mat
tne books of tne. California Packing Com
pany had been falsified wan proven by
the experts who worked on the books.
The accounts of the packing company
were as Intricate as a Cninese puzzle and
glaring discrepancies were alleged. It was
round that Kile J. Coie, president of the
California Packing Company, had secured
Indorsements of his father-in-law, A. B.
Patrick, the well-known tanner, to notes
amounting to $(6,u00. Large sums of
money, which It was claimed had been,
paid by the California Packing Company
to the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works,
were found to have never reached the lai
ter firm. . .
Kile J. Cote was accused of having util
ized the money of the California Packing
Company for his own purposes and it wan
claimed that he had lout many thousands
of dollars on horse races, prizo fights,
stocks and high living.
It was claimed that when Cote needed
money he went to his father-in-law, Pat
rick, who was ill in bed. and induced him
to indorse not' for large sums. Cote
was accused of securing the Indorsements
by representing that the money was need
ed to pay the debts of the California
Packing Company to the Pacific Vinegar
and Pickle Works.
The notes were discounted by Cote an 1
King with various banks, and Just what
became of the proceeds the Investigating
creditors were unable to discover.
While Patrick's sons were trying to find
out how much their father had lost by
Cote's duplicity the San Francisco Na
tional Bank took a hand In the affair.
Cote and King were accused of having
secured loans from the bank by gross
fraud, and the police were asked to find
the two men. Neither Cote nor King
could be located, and the Investigation
by the creditors of the packing company
disclosed disaster on disaster In the af
fairs of the collapsed corporation. Cote
was accused of having ruined his father
in-law, Patrick, while King stood accused
of embezzlement of thousands of dollars
belonging to the California Packing Com
pany * King and Cote Missing.
King and Cote could not be found by
the police," and a reward was offered for.
Information' leading to the arrest of King.
Thousands of circulars were sent all over

the world containing a picture and de
scription of King.
Further charges were made against
King, who was looked upon as the arch
promoter in the transactions that hail
wrecked the California Packing Company
While the police were looking for King
his associate. Cote, turned up in the c'.t/
a few days after the collapse of the pack
ing firm. Cote "stood pat" and declare 1
that he was Innocent of all wrong doing.
He asserted that his firm had lost money
in legitimate ways and that he could
prove himself innocent of any complicity
In th* dealings of King.
After a few days' excitement the affairs
of the California Packing Company were
lost to public view. The business* of the
collapsed firm was taken as an asset by
the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works.
That corporation was called upon to
make good many of the notes given to It
by Cote's company and Indorsed by his
father-in-law. Patrick is estimated to
have lost more than $100,000 by the deal-
Ings of his son-in-law, and sympathy was
expressed on all sides for the ruined
man.
In the absence of King no steps, were
taken against Cote, who Is now traveling
for a wholesale firm. Six weeks after
King fled from San Francisco he was lo
cated In Toronto. Canada. Detective Tom
Gibson, who had charge of the case. In
formed the directors of the Pacific Vine
gar and Pickle Works of the whereabouts
of Kin?, but the officers of the corpora
tion took no steps to bring him back to
this city.
When King surrendered himself yester
day to Gibson the detective said to him:
"I knew where you were six weeks after
you left, but the firm did not seem anx
ious to get you back."
"It-was all a mistake," replied King
with a smile, "and I will prove my Inno
cence."
Detective Gibson stated yesterday that
he did not think King would be prose
cuted and believed that the whole matter
had been settled by King and the officer.*
of the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works.
May Not Be Prosecuted.
Secretary Schumacker of the Pacific
Vliiespr and Pickle Works expressed sur
prise to hear that King was In the city.
Schumacker stated that many erroneous
statements had been made when the Cali
fornia Packing Company collapsed.
"It Is not true." said Bchumneker. "that
Cote's father-in-law, Patrick, lost a large
sum of money by indorsing notes for
Cote's firm. It was nil a mistake. The
firm I am with lost heavily by having to
make those notes good to the banks that
had discounted them. Patrick could not
meet them, and we had to do It. We
were deceived by Patrick's rating at
Bradstreet's, otherwise we would not nave
taken those notes."
Schumacker denied that his firm had
ever authorized the Issuance of a circular

NON-UNION MAN
Unknown Assassin Kills
Otto M. Ekberg With
Piece of Pipe.
Deals Murderous Blow and
Then Smiles at His
Bloody Deed.
Otto M. Ekbefg, a non-union teamster,
was cruelly . murdered last evening at
Third and townsend streets. He was
struck on the head with a gasplpe fully
two feet long by some unknown man.
Shortly after 7 o'clock Ekberg left the
barn of his' employers, on Townsend
street, and was proceeding along Third
tsreet when his j murderous assailant
sneaked up behind him and struck the
fatal blow. . After the unfortunate man
had fallen to the ground, face downward,
the assassin turned his body over and
took a good look at him. With a satisfied
smile, as though pleased with his bloody
work, the man ran down the street and
made his escape. The assassin had hard
ly disappeared when Ekberg breathed his
last. -.-
Witnessed the Murder.
The only witness to the murder was
Mrs. Alma Miller of 32 Clyde street. She
'was on her way to here home when Ek
berg was struck down. Her story of the
tragedy is as follows: .
"'I was walking along Third street when
I noticed a man following the one who
was killed. I noticed the fellow take a
piece of pipe from under his coat, and,
sneaking up behind his unsuspecting vic
tim, strike him a terrible blow on the
head with it. ' ' %
"As the man who I now know was Ek
berg fell lifeless to the ground the mur
derer turned the body over and took a
look at his face. With a smile that !>.â¢
t'nV e complete satisfaction the assassin
Un aif the gas pipe away and ran along
Rich street toward Brannan. I do not
think I would be able* to identify him if
he in arrested. He appeared to be a young
man and wore a dark suit of clothes. He
had his coat collar turned up and wore
his hat â a dark slouch one â pulled down
over his eyes. He evidently did not think
anybody was looking at him. as he .'.id
not appear In any great hurry to leave
the scene."
Ekberg. Shot a Striker.
During the big strike Ekberg was given
employment by W. P. Fuller as a team
ster. While he nnd another non-union
man were walking along Grant avenue
about two weeks before the strike was
settled they encountered over twenly
1 union men. who at once attacked them.
'Bkberg and his* friend dr,ew their revol
vers and fired Into the crowd, wounding
one of the attacking party In the leg. lie
was arrested for the shooting, but as it
was shown that he had acted In self de
fense- he was released. Since then Ekberg
lived in fear of being maimed or killed
by the men at whom he tired the shots.
As soon as the murder was reported to
Captain Seymour he sent Detectives Tom
I Gibson and HammllT to the scene. They
| made a thorough Investigation, but were
i unable to get any trace of the murderer.
offering a reward for the arrest of King.
Detective Gibson stated yesterday that
â¢Home of the directors of the Pacific Vino
gar and Pickle Works had approved the
circular before It was printed.
It was learned yesterday evening that
j King arrived In the city a few days ago
i and that he had been seen around town
during the week. That ho will be proeo
ruted Â¦â¢â¢ins unlikely, judging- from the
Indifference of the Pacific Vinegar and
Pickle Works. .
I] Secretary Schumacker -/>f_the Pacific
Vinegar and Pickle Works stated yester
day that he could not say whether or not
King would be prosecuted an the charge
of embezzling *â¢.Â». which ho (Sihumack
er) had sworn to last year. Â¦Â¦.-â¢ -.Â» '-
"The matter to last year, the directors,"

he raid, "and until they met J cannot
say anything In the matter^* 1 ? " ; "> Â¦
When Schumacker was naked if King
had not made a settlement with the Pa
cific Vinegar and Pickle works. in order
to avoid prosecution, ho answered:
"It may be that it has been done, but I
do not know of It. Perhaps some of our
directors may have done this, but if ho it
has not been reported to me. I cannot
give any further information on the mat
ter until I am authorized to do so by the
directors of my company."
Attorney High ton's Explanations.
Attorney Henry E. Hlghton stated last
evening that King never had any reason
to leave San Francisco, and that he hnd
been accused of offenses of which he was
perfectly Innocent.
"King was secretary In name only of
the California Packing Company." said
Attorney Hlghton, "and was not con
cerned In the manipulations of Cote, the
president of the company. The books of
the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Company
disclosed an overdraft of about 17000.
King was of a nervous nature and he
fled front the city when ho should have
remained. It Is possible that he mlg>U
have cleared. up many of the discrepan
cies In the books of his firm. There will
be no prosecution on the charge of steal
ing $350. on which King surrendered him
self to-day. ? *Â» ~
"The Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Com
pany secured judgment against. him In the
Bum of $7000 to reimburse Itself on the
overdraft. On an execution the company
obtained possession of King's library and
valuable data of the early days of Cali
fornia, which he inherited from his fath
er. The execution has not been sufficient
to satisfy the Judgment, but the company
I* acting very fairly in the matter. It is
possible that King can explain many de
tails and reduce the amount of the over
draft. King was always devoted to his
family and when not at his business he
was at his home. * ,
"He never visited a racetrack In his life
and was never known to gamble or dissi
pate. It Is unfortunate for him that he
left San Francisco. If he had remained
every charge against him would have
been cleared up. He hns not been guilty
of any criminal action, and the most that
can be Bald against him Ib that he wo*

MONTEBEY BAY FAMED
FOR ITS MANY FISHES
, PACIFIC GROVE. Nov. 9.-Presldent
fDavld Starr Jordan of Stanford University
lectured in this city last night before the
Pacific Grove Museum Association, his
subject being "Beasts and Fishes of Mon
terey Bay." Dr. Jordan, who Is probably
the most eminent authority on fish in the
world to-day, said that nowhere was
there a more Important body of water,
at least from the scientist's point of
view, than Monterey Bay, both for the
number of varieties of fish and other sea
animals found here and from the fact
that there are many kinds found here
that have never appeared In any other
part of the world.
The chief object of the Museum Asso
ciation is to preserve specimens of the
animal and plant life that has made this
region so famous throughout the scien
tific world, and Dr. Jordan's lecture was,
therefore, of especial interest to the
members of the association.

the condition of Madame Tsilka, Mis*

owing to her expected accouchement.
The belief that Miss Stone is concealed

A Sour Stomach
Is Often the Real Cause of a
Sour Temper.
T.at the condition of the digestive or-
ganÃ hat a marked effect upon the charac-
ter or disposition Is a truism as old as i
the hills. Old Ben Johnson wisely said. !
v|-
â¢:.Â» pleasure of living: depends upon the
liver," ' and it is a fact which none may
dispute that a sunny disposition more
often results from a healthy digestion
than from, any other cause.
Acid dyspepsia, commonly called sour
etcroach or heartburn, is caused by Blow
Â«!!cest?cn of food; Instead of being prompt-
ly digested and converted into blood, bone
and muscle, it lies in the stomach for
houre. fermenting and decaying, creating-
eases which cause pressure on the lungs
and heart, short breath and general din-
comfort end irritation.
Such half digested food Is Indeed poor
nourishment for the body, brain and
nerves and the result is thown in irritable
tempers?, unaccountable headaches and
that depressing condition usually called
the "blues." But how quickly all these
disappear when appetite and digestion are
restored.
I^axative medicines only irritate the al-
ready irritated stomach and bowels and
have r.o effect upon actual digestion of
food.
The sensible course to follow is to make
use o( simple natural digestives like
Ktuart ? Dyspepsia Tablets after meals
until the stomach has a chance to recup-
erate. *^
The natural digestives which every heal-
thy Etomacb contains are peptones dias-
tase and Hydrochloric and lactic acids
and when any of them are lacking the
trouble begins. The reason Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are no valuable and suc-
cessful In curing etomach troubles is be-
cause they contain, in a pleasant concen-
trated tablet form, all these absolutely
necessary essentials for perfect digestion
and assimilation of food.
Henry Kirkpatrick of Lawrence, Mass
bays: "Men and women whose occupation
precludes an active out door life should
make lt a dally practice to use Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after meals. I have
done so hivk<:( and I know positively that
I owe my present health and vigor to
their dally use.
"From the time I was 22, when I gradu-
ated from school with broken health from
overwork, until I was 34, I scarcely knew
what it was to bo free from stomach
weakness. I had no appetite whatever for
breakfast and very HttiÂ© for any other
mr-al. - â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
"I had acidity and heartburn nearly
very day and ho times was alarmed by
irregularity and palpitation of the heart.
but all this gradually disappeared after i
began using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and I can cat my meals with relish and
satisfaction which I had not known since
1 was a growing boy."
The kucc.-s and popularity of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is enormous, but It Is
deserved, and every druggist in the United

GERMANS WROTH
AT CHAMBERLAIN
Remark of the British
Statesman Creates a
Furor.
Students Will Petition Chan
cellor to Demand an
Apology.
BERLIN, Nov. Germany has rung
with anti-Chamberlain indignation meet
ings all the week. These meetings have
been confined hitherto to students and vet
erans' societies, but a conference of the
Thurlngian ".Pastors' societies has decided
to invite the Protestant clergymen
throughout Germany to make a common
protest against the utterances of the Brit
ish Colonial Secretary at Edinburgh, Oc
tober 25. when he referred to the conduct
of the German troops during the Franco-
Prussian war of IS7O-71.
Students" meetings were held this week
at the Berlin. Leipzig. Tuebingen, Jena
and other universities. The Leipzig meet
ing was held in response to a call sent
out by the rector of the university. The
Jena students voted to petition the Im
perial Chancellor, Count Yon Bulow, to
instruct the German Embassador at Lon
don to demand satisfaction for insult.-
The students of Breslau University have
issued a call couched in highly indignant
terms for a meeting to take place Novem
ber 12. At all the meetings the speakers
used violent language, and all the pub
lished calls are hotly worded. The Leip
zig Veterans' League has declined to i-
sue a call for a meeting, taking the
ground that it is useless to become excite
over Chamberlain, "since he is known to
be the commonest kind of a liar."
Editors Advise Calmness.
The newspapers are beginning to wain
the people, irom different standpoints,
however that the matter is being over
done, some of them claiming that Cham
berlain is too far beneath German con
tempt for anything which he may say to
be looked upon as an insult to the ool
diers of Germany. Others say that the
excitement will result in a further strain
ing of the relations between Germany and
Â«;r*-.u Britain. â¢ The Vorwaerts considers
the protest movement to be ridiculous and
says the intensity of the language used is
comical.
The Vosslsche Zeltung regrets Jhat many
of the speeches delivered contained vio
lent attacks upon Great Britain and re
fers to the danger that a resurrection of
the Eastern question will have a tendency
to draw Great Britain, Russia and France
together, and the consequent necessity of
Italy casting her fortunes with Great
Britain and France, thus leaving Ger
many in a state of "splendid isolation."
The paper asks if it is prudent, in such
circumstance?, to follow a course calcu
lated to prove that the German people
are imbued with the most . profound
hatred of Great Britain and, calling at
tention to the fact that Chamberlain's ob
noxious remark included the troops of
France. Russia and other nations, adds
that the French and Russians shrug their
shoulder?, regarding Chamberlain as a
babbler, and says they do not think of
crusading against Great Britain with
grand orations as the arch enemy of the
policy of great empires. Such a crusade,
according to the Vosslsche Zeltung, can
not be conducted merely with warm
hearts, cool heads being needed, adding:
"It is not necessary for Germans to stu
diously nourish anti-German feelings
against Great Britain, and It Is a mistake
to defend ourselves by exaggerated dem
onstrations."
Duel Causes Indignation.
The public mind was considerably ex
cited this week on account of a duel at
Insterburg, East Prussia, In which Lieu
tenant Blaskowitz of the army, was killed
by Lieutenant Hlldebrand, also of the
army. The military officials have not yet
made a statement of the facts In the case,
but the National Zeitung has obtained an
authoritative account of the meeting,
which Is as follows:
Lieutenants Hlldebrand and Rassmus
sen met Lieutenant Blaskowitz going home
one night in a state of Intoxication, car
ried him to a spot near his residence and
left him there. They returned to the
spot later, however, and found Blasko
witz crouching against a wall asleep and
tried to arouse him and get him upon his
feet. Blaskowitz. being ignorant of the
identity of the two men who were en
deavoring to assist him, struck right and
left in his semi-somnolent state and hit
Lieutenant Hlldebrand.
The latter considered himself Insulted
by the blow received and reported the
affair to the court of honor, which de
cided that a duel was unavoidable, where
upon Lieutenant Hildebrand challenged
Lieutenant BlaÂ«kowitz. The latter, how
ever, unconscious of what had occurred
while he was Intoxicated, went to Kylau
the next day to attend a party held at
the house of a young lady whom he was
to marry on the following day. When a
telegram recalling him to meet Hilde
brand was received Blaskowitz wanted to
settle the matter with an apology, but the
highest officers of the brigade and divi
sion sanctioned the finding of the court
of honor that a duel was necessary, and
It ended in the manner already detailed.
Newspapers of all shades of opinion ex
press amazement at the action of the
court of honor. Even the conservative
papers regard the action of the court as
being incomprehensible. It is expected
that the case will come before the
Reichstag. The papers use the strongest
language against permitting duels like
the above, holding that the superior offi
cers are responsible.
WRECK A BANK SATE,
BUT GET NO MONEY
Indiana Robbers Use Nitro-Glycerin,
but Are Driven Off by
Citizens.
CAMPBELLSBURG, md.. Nov. 6â A
gang of robbers wrecked the Bank of
Campbellsburg safe earÂ»y to-day with
nitro-glycerin. The noise aroused the
citizens and before the robbers could
reach the money in the safe armed citi
zens swooped down on them and drove
them from the building. Fifty shots were
fired by the citizens, but only one was
returned.
Their ammunition giving out, the citl
zens went across the street to replenish,
and the burglars took advantage of their
absenc* to escape to the northward on
the Monon road. The burglars secured no
money, and it is not believed any of them
were wounded.
Beresford and Naval Policy.
LONDON, Nov. 9â The Government's
r.aval policy is soon likely to be brought
prominently and perhaps unpleasantly to
public notice, as Rear Admiral Charles
Bcresford will shortly be relieved of his
post as second ln command of the Medi
terranean fleet and Is coming home to
enter Parliament at the earliest oppor
tunity. Lord Beresford Intends to devote
his energies to a political career until it
comes his turn to command the Channel
squadron, which has always been thÂ«
height of his ambition. While on duty In
the Mediterranean he has won every
sham battle in which he was engaged.

Sons of the Late Statesman
Reply to an Address
While in Sackcloth.
PEKING, Nov. 9.â The foreign Minis
ters this afternoon went ln a body, wear
ing plain mourning, to the late Li Hung
Chang's yamen and presented their con
dolences according to Chinese custom.
Chinese soldiers lined the streets near the
yamen and the great crowds which gath
ered in the streets and about the yamen
I were perfectly orderly. All the city ottt-
I'cials received the Ministers in the outer
! court. The coffin was in a spacious in
ner court, temporarily roofed. It rested
on an altar behind a screen and had over
it a royal pall, conferred by the Empe
lor's command, an honor heretofore be
stowed only on members of the imperial
family. Many Buddhist priests were in
attendance. There were towb of tables
bearing offerings of food, amounting to
several tons, and piles of paper money.
Candles and Incense were burned about
the coffin.
Li Hung Chang's two sons stood near
the casket attired ln sackcloth. Before
the screen was a cushion where the Chi
nese callers made prostrations. The Min
isters, however, stepped forward singly
and bowed low. The dean of the diplo
matic corps rend an address of sympathy,
to which the oldest son of the deceased
statesman replied in Chinese, the young
est son interpreting his words into Eng
lish. The scene about the yamen was ani
mated and picturesque. Hundreds of oftt
dals were present ln their robes of office.
Mounted retainers are arriving daily from
all parts of the province.
Shao Is Minister Wu's Friend.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 9.â Minister Wu
Ting Fang has received from Peking an
official notification of the death of LI
Hung Chang. It is said at the Chinese
legation that Minister Wu has not been
Informed of his reported relief as Chi
nese Minister at Washington. As already
Ptated, the Minister would not be sur
prised at such news. He has been Minis
ter at Washington since 1897. and un
doubtedly would welcome a chance to re
turn to "his native land, although it is
equally true that he will not want to re
main there permanently.
The Minister states he has no idea what
post will be assigned him if he should be
recalled from Washington. It was said
a short time ago that an important port
lollo In the Chinese Ministry would be
tendered him, but now all the posts In
that branch of the Government have teen
tilled. It Is felt here that the appoint
ment of Wang Wen Shao to succeed Li
Hung Chang as the throne's adviser In
foreign affairs will be beneficial to Wu's
interests.
America Keeps Close Watch.
The State Department never has had a
copy of the treaty negotiated by LI Hung
Chang and the Russian agent at Peking
relative to Manchuria, to which reference
was made In the public account of Lt
Hung Changs death. This Government
naturally has kept a close watch on the
developments ln that quarter, having,
next to Japan, perhaps, a larger legiti
mate interest than any other country
than the two principals to the treaty. As
negotiations nave been proceeding for
months lt Is unavoidable that some de
tails should leak o\it so that all the pow
ers signatory to the protocol have what
is believed to be a generally accurate
Idea of the scope of the proposed conven
tion which has now been blocked by the
death of Li Hung Chang. Officially this
Government Is accepting the Russian
pledge of a purpose to withdraw from
Manchuria In a reasonable time as bona
fldÂ«. and finds no reason to question the
integrity of the Russian purpose. Mean
while, following a practice inaugurated
five or six years ago, a United States
warship, the Vlcksburg. has been ordered
to winter at Niuchwang, the principal
port of Manchuria.
STEEL CORPORATIONS
WILL FORM A TRUST
Fifty Million Dollars to Be the
Capital for a New
Concern.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 9â The North
American to-morrow will say: A new
$60,000,000 steel corporation Is being formed
for the purpose of uniting ln one powerful
combination the plate mills of the coun
try. Ten or more plants. Including Penn
sylvania companies that are now doing a
large business, are to be absorbed by the
new concern. Four of the properties are
east of the Alleghanlea. These are the
Lukens Iron Works of Coatesvllle, the
Tidewater Steel Company. Chester; the
Ontral Steel Company, Harrlsburg. and
the Worth Hros.' mills. These four rep
resent an active estimated capitalization
of about $10,000,000.
It is understood that the Jones 8c
Laughltn Company of Plttnburg. a corpo
ration with 520.000.000 capital, will enter
the combination and will be the strongest
concern In It. Details regarding the West
ern Interests that will be represented are
lacking, but these will probably be made
in the course of n. few days In an official
announcement of the project. A signifi
cant feature of the deal is the active part
tnken ln it by Charles M. Schwab, presi
dent of the United States* Steel Corpora
tion. Schwab attended a conference held
In this city early in the week and had
much to do with shaping the plans of the
concern. This Is believed to Indicate that
ti will be operated in harmony with the
billion-dollar corporation, and that event
ually the new company may become iden
tified with Schwab's corporation.
Lodge Favors Reciprocity.
BOSTON, Nov. 9.â An exceptionally
large number of the members of the Mid
dlesex Club attended the dinner of the
club at Young's Hotel this afternoon. The
gathering Included many of the Massa
chusetts delegation In Congress. State and
national officers and prominent "Republi
cans. Senator Lodge was the prlncipnl
speaker. He strongly urged reciprocity
with other countries along the lines men
tioned in President McKlnley's Buffalo
speech, and the unbuilding of the navy.
Senator Lodge began his address with
a brief allusion to the recent elections,
and then delivered an eloquent euloey
upon the late President McKlnley. He
made a lengthy argument for general re
ciprocity in our commercial relations.
Burglars Raid a Bank.

WAR SADDENS
THE PREMIER
Salisbury Speaks at Lon
don Lord Mayor's
Banquet.
Regrets the Ravage, but Says
the Boers Will Ec
Crushed.
LONDON, Nov. 9.â The Lord Mayor's
banquet at the Guildhall to-night was a
spectacular close of the day's festivities.
The historic building was the scene of a
brilliant pageant in which modern and
medieval sights were strangely mingled..
A gathering uf 2000 of the most influential
citizens of London, including the heads of
the various Government departments,
gave an opportunity for a loyal demon
stration of which the Government was not
slow to take advantage.
The presence of Lord Salisbury afforded
an excellent excuse for reiterating the at
titude of the Government toward the
South African controversy. The response
of the great audience ln the banquet hall
might be described as satisfactorily loyal,
but could hardly be called enthusiastic.
The banquet was preceded by the cus
tomary reception in the library-room,
where Sir Joseph Dlmsdale in his quaint
official robes welcomed the Ministers and
the various officials. Unlike last year's
reception when the war fever was at Its
height the military were decidedly a sec
ondary feature. Lord Roberts was con
spicuous by his absence and the War
Office was merely represented by one of
the under secretaries.
Address by the Premier.
The feature of the evening was Lord
Salisbury's speech in response to the toast
to "His Majesty's Ministers." Referring
to the progress of the war ln South Africa
the Premier said:
lt is pleasant to record that the peace of
the world has been so little disturbed by the
events of the last two years. Half a century
ago we would nut have found such a correot
and paclflc attitude on the part of the great
powers. It is a suggestive sign of the inter-,
national amity and understanding that the
cloud of the past three weeks over the Mediter
ranean has so lightly passed away. Fifty
years ago thla would not have been so.
Touching upon South African develop
ments in another part of his speech Lord
Salisbury said:
I strongly deprecate the spirit of pessimism
so frequently heard in the utterances of some
of our public men as to the war ln which we
are engaged. Unlike the wars of former years,
no longer does the capture of an enemy's capi
tal and the dissipation of his Hold force con
stitute a conclusive victory. We are flow con
fronted by a syntem of guerrilla warfare
which must be slowly and effectively stamped
out. We are progressing slowly, perhaps but
steadily.
Government in Earnest.
I cannot take the public wholly Into the con
fidence of the Government. It would be most
Imprudent publicly to state all we are doing
weekly and monthly at the front, but what
I emphatically declare is that whatever delays
are encountered these are due neither to a
lack of earnestness and ability on the part of

STORM CENTERS
ON SALISBURY
Appointment of a Bishop
Arouses Harsh Crit
icism.
Charge Made That It Is
Another Instance of
Nepotism.
LONDON, Nov. 9.â The appointment of
the Rev. Charles Gore, Canon of West
minster, to be Bishop of Worcester, has
raised both a political and ecclesiastical
storm. Only a few days previous to the
announcement of his appointment Mr.
Gore came out ln the Times with a strong
letter condemning the concentration
camps and other severe measures in South
Africa. Several of the Government or
gans stigmatized him as a pro-Boer and
deplored the fact that such a talented au
thor should have been so hopelessly mis
led.
The matter Is now the object of keen
private criticism among the lay and cleri
cal supporters of the Government. The
Evangelical party ln the church are bit
terly upbraiding Lord Salisbury for se
lecting a man so prominent in high cir
cles. In less prejudiced quarters the af
fair Is taken as once more exemplifying
Lord Salisbury's extraordinary cynicism
and utter lack of Interest in current
events, though others see ln It another
Instance of nepotism, as the former head
of the Pusey House at Oxford and editor
of Lux Mundi Is a connection of the Pre
mier's family.
Among the curious features of the case
is the fact that Canon William John Knox
Little of Worcester, who replied to Mr.
Gore's letter ln the Times, bitterly abus
ing t"he writer and intimating that Mr.
Gore was almost guilty of treason and was
threatened with Insanity, now comes un
der the Jurisdiction of the new Bishop.
Porto Rico Treasurer Appointed.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â The President
to-day appointed William Willoug-hby of
the District of Columbia Treasurer of the
inland of Porto Rico. Willoushby will suc
ceed Jacob Hollander of Maryland, who
resigned some time ago.
our generals in the field nor to a neglect to
comply with all their demands on the part of
the home Government. We have been subject
to much vague and indefinite criticism, but our
bitterest opponents have not been able to point
out any tangible defect, any definite cause of
complaint.
I deeply regret the ravages of the war ln
the colonies, to which we are anxious to ac
rord the fullest practicable measure of self
government. But we have bad neighbors ln
South Africa whose conduct for years has been
a menace to the stability of that section of our
empire. Now we are engaged In removing this
menace and we are determined to do it so
effectively that lt will never require doing
again.
This declaration was received with cor
dial but by no means enthusiastic ap
plause.
CABINET FEARS
PUBLIC ANGER
British Ministers Are
Afraid to Enforce
Old Laws.
Gravity of South African Sit
uation Increases
Daily.
LONDON. Nov. 9.â During the lengthy
Cabinet conference of this week the ques
tion of enforcing the old ballot laws came
up. Some of the Ministers were strongly in
favor of putting in practice thla form of
conscription, for which certain obselete
laws already provide. By this means new
legislation would be obviated.
Guarded feelers on this matter have al
ready been circulated in the press, for it
appears to be almost impossible to keep
the home forces up to adequate strength
and supply the necessary reinforcements
for South Africa volunteers. Strenuous
measures doubtless will cause a storm ot
disapproval ln Great Britain and the laws
will not be enacted unless the war situa
tion becomes graver. What changes have
come over the state of the country In two
years can be Judged from the fact that
the War Office has closely examined the
old ballot laws and has prepared an elab
orate plan by which they can be sprung
upon the public at a moment's notice.
The Dally News exhaustively surveys
the concentration camps ln South Africa
with the following conclusion:
"The truth is that the death rate in the
camps Is incompatibly worse than any
thing Africa or Asia can show. There is
nothing to match lt, even in the mortality
figures of the Indian families, where chol
era and other epidemics have to be con
tended with."
Statistics are produced ln proof of this
assertion. m
The Government's advertisement for
teachers for the camp children, setting
forth that "the term of employment will
be one year certain," is prominently dis
played as evidence that the authorities
nave no Intention of ending the "wholesale
destruction of human life."
The Daily News urges all humane men
not to wait for official reports but to In
sist "on the camps being broken up and
the people distributed among their friends
or removed to districts where a fresh at
tempt can be made, under competent or
ganization and with some regard to the
preservation of lifeâ that or extermination
and an eternal stain on the name of Eng
land."

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Nov. 9 â

CANCER
Sufferers from this horrible malady
nearly always inherit it â not necessarily
from the parents, but may be from some
remote ancestor, for Cancer often runs
rough several generations. This deadly
poison may lay dormant in the blood for
yesrs, or until you reach middle life, then
the first little sore or ulcer makes its ap-
I^arance âor a swollen gland in the
breast, or some other part of the body,
gives the first warning.
To cure Cancer thoroughly and perma-
nently all the poisonous virus must be
eliminated from the blood â every vestage
of it driven out. This S. S. S. does, and
is the only medicine that can reach deep-
seated, obstinate blood troubles like this.
When all the poison has been forced out
of the Eastern the Cancer heals, and the
disease never returns.
Cancer begins often in a small way, as the
following letter from Mrs. Shirer shows :
A small plraple cair.e on my jaw about an inch
below the ear on the left side ef my face. It gave
tne no paincr sneonveu- .^BS^sSsJw

Congratulates De Witte

Line.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. -âReplying
to a congratulatory telegram from the
Finance Minister, M. <Ie W'itte, announc
ing the eompleuon of the Siberian Rail
road the Czar telegraphed as follows:
"I thank you sincerely Cor your joyfu'
communication. I congratulate you on
ihe completion â¢within so short a time an-Â»
amid i&ci edible difficulties of one of the
greatest railroad undertakings of the
world "
M. de Wine's telegram recalled the fact
that the Bar turned the sod of the rail
road to Vladivostok May 19, 1901. and that
on the anniversary of his accession the
line was completed.
The Minister added: "With the laying
of rails a distance of 24Â«0 versts from
Trans-Baikal territory to Vladivostok and
Port Arthur our enterprise in Manchuria
is practi< al!y though not entirely con
cluded. Temporary traffic is now possible

GRAIN-LADEN FLEET OF VESSELS MAKES SAIL AND
SUGAR BOATS ARRIVE IN PORT FROM THE ISLANDS
THE NEW STEAMSHIP NOW BEING BUILT BY HAY & WRIGHT TO REPLACE THE ALOHA THAT "WAS
BURNED IN RICHARDSONS BAY SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. SHE WILL BE PLACED IN THE COAST TRADE
WHEN SHE GOES INTO COMMISSION NEXT x EAR.
A BIG fleet of sailing vessels sailed
for coast and foreign ports yester
day, while nearly as large a num
ber of windjammers arrived.
Among those that got in were the
Kosmos liner Totmes and the barks AlÂ»
bert and Alden Besse and barkentine Will
iam EL Dlmond.
Among the departures were the Kosmos
liner S*sostrls and the ships Toxteth. Cali
fornia and Haddon Hall. The Astral. W.
S. Ciampa and La Bruyere were to have
gone out, but the threatening weather
and difficulty in securing sailors kept
them from putting to sea.
The Toxteth. Haddon Hall and Califor
nia are all bound for England and there
is a good-natured rivalry among the cap
tains as to which vessel will get home
first. Captain Pritchard of the Haddon
Hall has his vessel In nrst-class trim and
he expects to win out, while Captain Doty
Â¦f the California and Captain Lines of
the Toxteth are equally confident that
they will win. The Italian ship F. S.
Clainpa and the French bark La Bruyere
sail to-day for Europe, and they also are
to have a race. If the Carnpa wins Cap
tain Lesage of the La Bruyere la to pay
Tor a dinner, while if the bark proves
the winner. Captain Maresca will have to
do the honors. Both the latter captains
expect to beat the English ships, which
sailed yesterday to Queenstown.
ACCIDENT ON THE TOTMES.
Two Men Killed by an Accidental Ex
plosion of Signal Sockets.
There was a peculiar accident on
the Kosmos liner Totmes by which
Third Officer Slevers and Second Steward
\Y inkier lost their lives. The vessel ar
rived yesterday from Hamburg via San
Benlto and only brought up one passen
ger. The newa of the disaster was teleÂ»
graphed from Central America, but the
details were lacking.
Third Officer Sievers was In the room
In which the powder, rockets and other
explosives were kept, making an inven
tory of the stock. By some means or an- I
other a rocket was set off and the room i
was wrecked. Sievers lived for five hours j
and told the captain that he must have j
dropped a match, or else a spark from I
his pipe did the mischief. The unfortunate
officer was terribly burned and died In
great agony.
Second Steward Wlnkler must have been
passing the door when the powder room
blew up He waa found In the scuppers
with the door covering him and stone I
dead. His Â«kull was fractured and he
must have been killed Instantly. Just at
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 10,. 1901.
the moment of the disaster he must have
been at the entrance to the room and the
explosion forced the door out on top of
him and he was thrown against a stapch
lon, fracturing his skull.
Carrier Pigeon Comes Aboard.
Captain Corkhill of the British ship
Sierra Blanca reports a peculiar experi
ence during the run from Europe to San
Diego. He wrote to the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday that when the vessel
was off Rio de Janeiro a carrier pigeon
came aboard. It made itself perfectly at
home and for more than a month was the
pet of the crew. Then It took a notion
to go farther afield and disappeared. Cap
tain Corkhill reports that it had a metal
band on Us right leg on which was
ptamped "18â 99â Â«1." while on Its left leg
It had a rubber band with "L 8" marked
on it. The chances are that the bird es
caped from an ocean liner.
New Aloha Under Way.
Hay & Wright are hard at work on a
vessel at Alameda Point that wijl be
practically a new Aloha. The old vessel,
after serving on the coast in the lumber
trade, was made into a passenger boat
and carried gold hunters to Nome. Then
she was changed back Into a steam
schooner, and during the strike was laid
up in Rlchardaons Bay, and while there
she caught nre and was burned to tho
water's edge. C. P. Doe & Co. purchased
the wreck and sent her over to the ship
yard to have her engines and boilers
taken out. But few of the old timbers
can be used in the reconstruction, ho
practically a new vessel is being built on
new plans. She will be launched early in
the year, and while no name has been
decided upon by her owners the chances
are she will be called Aloha.
Water Front Notes.

"'Â¦ i. .- â¢ .Â¦: ': Â¦ â¢ " ' Â»
The American College of Sciences of
Philadelphia. Pa., is a novel Institution.
It la chartered under State laws, with a
capital of $100,000, for the purpose of
teaching Personal Magnetism, Hypno-
tism, . Magnetic Healing, etc., by corre-
spondence. '
At an expense of over $5000 the college
has issued a remarkable work on these
sciences, ten | thousand copies of which
will be given Â¦ away absolutely free. The
book Is elegantly Illustrated with the
most expensive engravings, and it la de-
cidedly the finest and moat comprehen-
sive work of Its kind ever published. It
is the product of the combined talent of
thirty distinguished hypnotic specialists
and scientists, , It thoroughly explains all
the hidden secrets of Personal Magnetism.
Hypnotism, Magnetic Healing, etc. It is
full of surprising experiences, and makes
many startling disclosures In regard to
the use and possibilities of this secret
power. '
The college absolutely guarantees that
an/ one can learn these sciences in a few
days at home, and use the power with-
out, the knowledge of his most intimate
friends. _ â¢ T,
The reporter asked for the names and
addresses of some of the pupils so that
he might communicate with them per-
sonally. Several hundred were offered, ,
from which the reporter selected eighty-
four. The replies received were more
than sufficient to convince the most skep-
tical In regard to the wonderful benefits
to be derived from this mighty power.
There were absolutely no failures. All
had learned to make practical use of the
sciences. The following extracts are
taken at random from the letters for the
benefit of readers:
J. H. Bchneller, 1412 Avon St., La. Crosac,
\Y!s., writes: "Hypnotism truly reveals tha
| secrets of life and the mysteries of nature. My
own father could not have convinced me of its
wonderful power If I bad not actually tested it
for myself. I consider a knowledge of It Ink-
valuable to those who wish to get the most out
of life; to those who wish to achieve success
and live up to the full measures of their pos-
sibilities."
Mrs. Effle M. 'Watson. Martlnsvllle, lad.,
writes: "Hypnotism opens the road to health,
happiness and prosperity. It should be studied
by every one. I would not part with my knowl-
edge. of It for any amount. The Instructions
have developed within me a force of character,
an ability to Influence and control people that
I did not dream I could acquire."
J..W. Cllnser. # M. D.. Spring-field. Ohio,
writes: "I have used the methods of hypnotism
taught by the American College of Science In
two case* of difficult surgical operations wltn
perfect success. It la a complete anaesthetic,
and preferable to chloroform or ether. I ac-
quired a practical knowledge of hypnotism la
less than three days. The book Is grand."
Rev. T. W. Butler, Ph. D., Idaho City, Idaho
writes: "I have cured a number of chronic
cases of rheumatism, dyspepsia and paralysis
of lons standing; have not had a single failure;
I consider a knowledge of Personal Magnetism
Invaluable. The book has greatly Increased my
own powers."
Dr. W. P. Kennlcutt, 529 State St.. Blngham-
ton. N. T., writes: "I had Ions; suffered from
nervous iroatratlon and dyspepsia. My caso
baffled all medical skill. I studied hypnotism
from the American College of Sciences and
tried it upon myself with surprising results. In
one week my stomach was better than It hat!
been in thirty years. I could eat anything with-
out the slightest distress. I can hypnotize my-
self In five minutes and sleep all night; have
hypnotized a number of others."
The first ten thousand persons who
write to the American College of Sciences
will - receive, absolutely free, the marvel-
ous book that brought success to the
above persons. It is Intensely interest-
ing from start to finish. It should be In
every home. If you want a copy write
to-day to the American College of Sci-
ences, Dept. 18 8., 416-420 Walnut street,
Philadelphia, Pa., and' you will receive
the book by return mail.

TRADES COUNCIL
DENIES REPORT
Executive Board Says
Carpenters Did Not
Disobey.
The Building Trades Council took ac
tion last night regarding certain articles
which appeared ln yesterday's afternoon
papers and which were, according to the
executive board of the council, entirely
without foundation. After a lengthy dis
cussion the following official statement I
bearing the signatures of Louis Chester
chairman, and O. A. Tveitmoe, secretary,
was issued: '
In the preas of yesterday under the caption.
"Refused ord*r to atrlke," ia publlahed an
article In which la set forth the following-, to
wit: -Six striken took place yesterday (Fri
day) because of an order Isnutd by the Build
ing Tradea Council to boycot* Carpenters
Union No. 483. and that the plumbers quit
but that the carpenters from different union*
refused to obey the order, and that because of
their refusal much discussion was created In
labor circles last night."
The executive board of the Bulldlns: Trades I
Council desires to state positively that the en- '
tire article. In so far as It relates to strike* '
or boycotts on No. 483 men. Is absolutely with
â¢at foundation ln fact.
No carpenters refused to obey the orders ot
butlneafl scents, and whoever irave the news
to the writer of the above-mentioned article:
la saying the thlnz that was not. The great
majority of the carpenters are as good union i
men a* s.re to be found ln any trade In the '
Building Trades Council, and when there Is
an order Iraued by the council it Is always
lived un to by them.
Carpenter*' Union No. 483 voted to go back
to the Labor Council, and when It did so tho
union stood ausi>ended from the Building-
Trades Council, and that by Ita own act.
The effort that Is being made by some per
sons to disrupt, destroy and Impair the har
monious relations now i.nd for some time past
existing in the building Industry Is beyond our
comprehension, and In cur opinion can be at
tributed only to the fact that they are desirous
of keeping up a semblance of a fight for the
purpose. If possible, of covering up their past
mistakes. ;

ANOTHER BAY PIRATE
ARRESTED BY POLICE
They Had Planned to Strip a Steam
Schooner of Its Cabin Fur
nishings.
"Skinny" Conwell, an ex-convlct, was
arrested yesterday morning by Detective
Crockett and Policeman Regan and locked
up tn "the tanks." his cell adjoining that
occupied by John Reed. Conwell Is the
bay pirate at whom Crockett fired a shot
Friday morning when he arrested Reed
near the Seven-Mile House, San Bruno
Road. The police expect to capture the
oth'-r pirate at any moment, as he is
known. Besides the charge of stealing
the white paint belonging to W. D. Ful
ler & Co.. the police say they will have
three other charges against the pirates.
Reed, Conwell and the pirate still at
large are supposed to be the three men
who last Thursday morning went to the
ways of the R. W. Schults. ln South San
Francisco, and made ever)' preparation to
rob the steam schooner Tyrone. They had
rowed to the vessel in a skiff and bad
stripped the vessel's cabin of the furnish
ings, which they had stacked on a table,
ready to be carried away, when they were
surprised by the watchman. They jumped
Into the skiff, rowed quickly ashore and
fled, leaving the skiff on the beach.

PRESIDENT WHEELER COMPLIMENTS
BOTH VICTORS AND VANQUISHED
PRESIDENT BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER of the University of California said after the
game: "The playing on both sides seems to me to have been excellent. The game abounded in'
exciting plays. Plenty of kicking is alivays interesting to the spectators. After the ground â¢
grew slippery the operations around the ends evidently did not have the prospect of success that they
had on drier ground. There was no part of the game I personally enjoyed better than the excellent
interference which accompanied the plays around the ends. It is a great pleasure to me that we have
such sturdy, honorable antagonists as the students of Stanford University. I myself should be glad
to sec a trial of the best two in three games replace the one annual game. At any rate, considering
the special conditions existing on the Coast, it would be well, I think, to try the experiment. Our
team showed the right spirit throughout the game."

"They haven't played the game yet."
retorted Dr. Frank â¢Simpson, the blue
and gold coach. "Those blue and gold
jerseys have bundles of grit and heart
inside."
Simpson knew whereof he spoke, for
just a few minutes before he had talked
to the California e'even. Thcv say that
Simpson was so earnest in his last coun
sel that the Berkeley men had "tears in
their eyes when they left their dressing
rooms. But they gritted their teeth and

fornia the kick-off. While the game
was in its infancy the realization came
upon all that this pony team could play
football. Offense or defense, it was just
the same. The red bleachers became
suddenly silent. Turmoil, riot, uncon
strained joy ruled with a boisterous,
sonorous, sweeping force in the blue and
gold seats. Down the field went the
California cohorts yard by yard. Vic
tory, unexpected as it was, seemed
ready to perch upon the banners of the
lighter team. Over the field the cweers
carried and the echo came back from
the covered grand stand. The Califor
nia men lined up for another dash.
They were six yards from the goal â
from a touchdown that seemed immi
nent. Womble 1 was given the ball to
'advance toward the coveted line. He
fumbled it and Stanford was saved for
the ?ime.
Back the.y went to the fray, the car
dinal fighting every inch and California
forcing holes through the opposing line,
gaining at every stroke. It was great
sport, and thousands . and thou
sands of spectators realized it to
their uttermost satisfaction. Stan
ford fought every inch and the crowd,
appreciating the gameness of the strug
gle, applauded and shouted itself hoarse
and dry. The rain counted for nothing.
Both sides were lost in the ecstasy of
the real football excitement.
Back to the fight for yards of slippery
mud came the California men. This
-time they reaped the, fruits of their
labor. Mighty Overall, towering above
every other man in his team, broke
through the Stanford line and blocked
a kick. Over the line the ball* rolled
with both teams after it in hot haste.

that netted California the two points
and lost the game to Stanford.
CAME OUT TO WIN.
Then there was pandemonium. The
crowd soon learned that California bad
scored a safety and that it meant two
points. It was early in the first half.
The game was still young. California
had withstood its heavier antagonists.
Could it continue? The blue and gold
men said "Yes." The cardinal rooters
yelled a sturdy "No." "We have weight
and strength." they said. '"We will win.
Wait." To the California supporters
this assurance had-an- ominous ring. It
hovered over the heads of the players
throughout the (tame. The slippery
ground, the prevalence of fumbles, the
leaden ball, the epidemic of blocked'
kicks on both sides put an uncertainty
on the result that made the perching?
place of victory almost impossible to
forecast.
The first half was fought out with
grim determination on both sides. Cali
fornia felt its measure and sained cour
age as the game progressed. It soon
became on the part of the blue and gold
an effort to win and not merely stayÂ«
off defeat. The offensive was taken
and the cardinal then iell back to the job
of holding the fort. Suoh was the
spirit that animated the elevens when
the players, bedraggled with ruud and
their identities lost in the slimy, cakinÂ«r.
walked off the field at the end of the

his nose was awry, but lie 7ias unmindful of his bruises, being so elated with the victory. In dis
cussing the game he said: "We outplayed them at every point. When I lost my front tooth I knew
we would win. Every time I lost a tooth our team has won the day. Our men did icltat I expected
them to do. They went into the game with a feeling that they would wm or be carried off the field.
It was pure grit that won us tlw game. Every man on the team wqs imbued with college spirit.
Stanford played a gentlemanly game. The better team won. Coaches Simpson and Hopper cannot
be thanked too much for their excellent work. The good condition of the team was due to Walter
Qhristy, our trainer. Bert Oliver's rcferccing was of high order. I believe the umpiring was not up
to the usual standard."

the young fellow rescue her. Nine masked

all to rout. The fathers of this loving
couple apparently relent after this event,

and the decision of the umpire who sent
him there. On the lime line he sat,

DR. FRAXK SIMPSON, head coach of the University of California's eleven, said: "I am
as happy as a man could he. lam glad it rained. We gave the cardinal everything they
wanted and still we outplayed them man to man. We outgeneraled, outpuntcd and out
bucked them. Our defense was superb. Ours was a team of eleven men with hearts as large as
oxen's. Every man went into tliat game with a determination to do or die. On that team were men
who cried when I talked to them before the contest. Ho:c can you defeat a team that has such men
among its members 9 The refereeing was as fine an exhibition of its kind as was ever given on this
(bast. I cannot speak too strongly against the umpiring by Dr. Garrey. It was bad.
"We went into the game m better physical condition. than our opponents. This was due to the
excellent care given the players by our trainer. There were no stars on our team. Every man was
in every play and was determined to win or die. It has been often said that spirit was lacking in
the University of California. I think to-day's game removed that charge. The team upheld the
blue and gold, and their fellow-students encouraged them on to victory by their cheering."

resulted In great advantage to Stanford,

manding a touchdown. 81aker and Trae

bucks and Traeger was sent back for :i
try ut place kick for a Held goal from tlu
45-yard line. The big tackle did not want
to kick, but Captain Fisher sustained
Raltl's JudÃmont. It was a forlorn hope
at such a distance and with a bull heavy
from rain and mud. Trueger's shoo wus
scraped and sponged cleun of mud by
Trainer Al Lean, the line strained mil
held, the ball was passed true and placed
true, and "Fluffy Bill" sent It sailing
toward the soal posts. The aim was
true as that of v sharpshooter, and the
moment while the ball hung In air was a
heartbreaking one for the grandstand and
blcucher crowds. But the distance whs
too great and the ball fell into More's
arms on the 10-yard line, More running
It In five yards.

FICKERT BLAMES WEATHER.
CHARLES FICKERT, zvho coached the Stanford team, attributes the cardinal's defeat to the
inclemency of the weather and to the fact that Berkeley had knozdedge of Stanford's sig
nals. He said: "Both teams were materially handicapped by the bad weather, zvhick
made quick and accurate playing impossible. Contrary to the general opinion it handicapped the
Stanford team considerably more than it did Berkeley.
"Berkeley played a good, hard game and won on her merits. Back of the line Mini and Worn
blc played a game that may wA be termed brilliant. In fact the whole Berkeley team zvithout any
exception played good football. Stanford was again handicapped in regard to the officials. They
might easily have been better. The umpire zvas entirely ignorant of the rules of the game. Bert Oliver,
as referee, was most satisfactory.
"Taking the game all in all and allowing for the weather, the playing on both sides, was very
good. Berkeley had too intimate a knowledge of our signals for us to have won. We lost, but we
lost to a great team."

lor offside play put California danicer

field goal. i
It was another "chills find fever situ

(ho 25-yard line. His chance was an ex
cellent one, except for the mud and rain,
but the ball went wide of the mark.
Stunford took the freo kick from the
25-yard line and the bull was Cnllfor

time In California territory and twice the
Stanford goal had been In danger In addi
tion to the time the sufety was scored.
The cardinal "rooters" still hoped that
their line would brace in the second half
i.nd on offensive would succeed In opening
up holes for the backs to plunge through.
Tho coaches rounded up the men and
anvc them advice, and the team came on
!Â»)Â¦â¢ field after the intermission of fifteen
minutes determined to turn tho tables,
\/Ut a few minutes of play developed a
icw factor, California's end running.
Wombie and Mini were soon making
dashes behind splendid Interference, while
Stanford's attacks upon the California
line were In the main as fruitless as in
the first half.
Stanford's Hope Is Vain.
Traegcr kicked off to the 30-yard tine.
Wombie made a great run of seventeen
yards aruund Clark's end, and Mini
skirted Cooper's end for the same gain.
Then each of these men was stopped in
succession by the Stanford ends. Overall

California fumbled, but recovered the
ball. Overall punted over the goal lin.-.
For Stunford Trueger punted from the
25-yard line and by a magnificent run
down the Held tackled Womble, running
the ball In on the Go-yard line. Tarpey
threw Wombie back on an end run for a
loss of five yards.
Overall's punt was blocked by a Stan
ford man, and oq downs the ball went to
Stanford on the 32-yard In* In California
territory.
At this point Wombie went out to his
okl position at end and Whipple went in
at half. Fisher. Slaker and McFadden
bucked to the 20-yard line, and the chance
for a touchdown temporarily made a rift
in the clouds for the Stanford "rooters."
The hope was vain, however, and the ball
went to California on downs.
Mint, clinging to Overall's hand, skirted
the end for eight yards. A plunge at cen
ter by Overall netted but a yard. Over
alt punted 40 yards, Raltt running it in 10
yards. California immediately took the
ball from Stanford an downs on the 50-

Tarpey stopped Mini's try at end. Over
all punted over Raitt's head to the 10-yard
line, but tJu- plucky Stanford quarter
caught up the ball and ran It back 15
yards. Overall and Tarpey and Hanaen
got mixed up in a slugging match and the
big Berkeley guard and the little Stan
ford end were both ruled off. Stroud
went in for Overall and Preston for Tar

bers and at tho present time the member

delegates, with a possibility of four in

cumbers many of the prominent residents

Is that It numbers more young members

members are forming a uniform rank and
the matter Is being enthusiastically taken
up. The remarkable growth of this lodge
Is clue to the untiring efforts of the effi

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
RING WORM AND DANDRUFF.
They Are Each Caused by a Pestifer-
ous Germ.
Ring worm and dandruff are somewhat
similar In their orlgrin; each Is caused by
a parasite. The germ that causes dan-
druff digs to the root of the hair and saps
Its vitality, causing falling* hair and, final-
ly, baldness. Without dandruff thero
would never be baldness, and to cure dan-
druff it Is necessary to kill the germ.
There has been no hair preparation that
would do this until the discovery of New-
bro's Herplclih!, which positively kills the
dandruff germ, allays Itching Instantly
and makes hair glossy and soft as silk.

DO WOMEN WORK TOO HARD?
. By MARGARET L. BRIGGS.
(ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.)
Is it right for women to work so hard? It is a fact that many pleas- â¢
ures are spoiled by the woman who is too tired to enjoy them, and whose
husband and children cannot enjoy them without her. Many a home is con-
tinually miserable because the mother of the household is always tlretl, al-
ways overworked.
We are put into this world to be as happy as we can. If that is true,
it ought to be the clear duty of every woman to shed happiness around
her. A happy woman accomplishes more good and does more to make those
about her happy than a half dozen women who are always working beyond
their, strength, and who are, as a result, too tired to give their families the
â¢ sympathy and love they need from her. '-
The fact of the matter is, men work just as hard as women. They do Â»
not attempt so much, it Is true, but their work tells, and they really accom-
plish more than women because they have a quiet way of going about a
thing and . getting it done. The average woman, knowing she has certain
work to do, will worry about it hours beforehand, and by the time she la
actually getting down to It she has worked herself up into such a state that
she expends twice as much energy as she should. At the end of the d, av Â»
having repeated this performance with every task, she is too tired to wet-
come the family home to dinner, too tired to dress, too tired to eat. The
family spends a gloomy evening. Not a word is said at the dinner table,
because they all miss the mother; afterward each crawls away to his room
because the bond between them Is broken when mother Is so tired. They
all feel sorry for her, but each wishes In his heart that she had left a little
of the work undone, and instead had charmed them with her presence and
the cheerfulness and happiness that surround her when she is not so tired.
This is an every-day occurrence In so many homes, for the women of
this generation generally are nervous and excitable. If they would go about
their work as coolly as a man does, they wouldn't get tired. But they can-
not do It, because their nerves will not let them. Â¦,
1 '.'Â¦ If women will but look after their physical condition they can overcome
that feeling of utter exhaustion. Let the woman who is always worked up
and nervous over her daily tasks, who Is always too tired at night to be
happy with her family, take Lydla E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. It
will soon cure her nervousness, and she will undertake each task as it cornea
. along without all the fuss and worry that make It so hard.
Half the things that women think are so terrible and in need of such
immediate reform would not be at all bad if they would sit down and think
about them rationally. Many of the reforms would work themselves out
without having so much energy wasted on them, if the women had but the
patience to wait.
* How much better It would be for every one if women. Instead of slav-
ing themselves to death and making all those about them miserable, would
understand that their physical condition makes them depressed, and that
things would not require so much effort and make them so tired if they
themselves were well. The women who are 'too tired to talk at night, too
tired to take any Interest in the affairs of the family outside of the house-
work and the care of the children, ; the women who unnecessarily make
slaves of themselves, almost always have some female disorder that seeks
an outlet in this nervous excitement or depression. Not one of the worn
who are always so tired but has a backache and a discharge of some kind,
â¢ showing that there is inflammation of the ovarian organs. Her condition it-
self would make her tired, even If she never did a stroke of work. Every
woman who is always sick and tired should make an effort to get well. if
only for the reason that her present condition makes her husband misera-
â¢. ble because he thinks she is working too hard for his sake. He would will-
ingly forego half of the attentions and comforts she provides for the sake
of a few happy hours in her society.
I wish every woman who feels so tired would look at this matter In, the
right way. Her condition will be easily overcome if she will take Lydia K.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, which strengthens the feminine organs
and cures all their ills. Mrs. Pinkham's medicine is just what is needed by
the woman who is always tired, excited, depressed or nervous. With it 3
use backaches and headaches disappear, the fret and worry and nervous-
ness are replaced by a cheerful and happy temperament, and the daily tasfta
grow lighter with each hour. Let the women who are working too hard,
who get too nervous and excited over their work, who are too exhausted to
eat. much of the time, try this remedy that has done so much, and la now
doing so much, to relieve those suffering from feminine troubles.

he visited Oneto Tribe of Baltimore, Md.,
was received most cordially and later In
the evening was the gueat of honor at a
banquet gotten up for him. The menu
was a strictly Raltimorean one. but with
out "fire water." He has offered to Oneto
Tribe the Anest regalia for a past sachem
that can be made In San Francisco, to
be given to the member bringing the
greatest number of palefaces Into the

more palefaces for the succeeding council.
A new tribe of the order will be insti

STRUGGLE BEFORE APPLAUDING THOUSANDS FOR SUPREMACY ON THE GRIDIRON
Harvard Men Defeat
the Quakers.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 9.â Harvard
to-day on Franklin Field, admin
istered to the I'niversity of Penn
sylvania one of the worst defeats
the latter has experienced since
she has been In the front rank In the
football world. The nnal score was: Har
vard 33. Pennsylvania 6.
Harvard scored twenty-two points In
the first and eleven points in the second
half, while Pennsylvania scored six points
in the first half. This single touchdown
was a gift of Marshall. Harvard's quar
ter-back. Reynolds kicked the ball to
Harvard's twenty-yard line, where Mar
shall fumbled it. Mitchell gathered it In
and ran about twenty yards for a touch-
Jown. After this Pennsylvania's chances
of scoring could never be considered seri
ously Once they were n.-ar enough to
Harvard's goal to try a goal from place
ment, but thÂ» ball went wide of the mark.
Pennsylvania's efforts to advance the
bail were reaiiy â¢ii>'i< ssinÂ»r. So better
proo" of this is needed than the fact that
during the first half the red and blue only
gamed four firs; downs vrhile Harvard
gamed twenty-seven. Only once during
the entire seventy minutes did the Phila
delphia eleven show anything like real
football and this was in the first five min
utes of play. During- this time the hall
was continuously in Harvard's territory.
but this was due not so much to Penn
sylvania's strength as to Harvard's fum
bling. The visitors were visibly affected
with rattles during the first few minutes
of piay. but when they struck their gait
it was only a question of the proportions
of the score.
Strangely enough. Captain Campbell was
responsible for the majority of Harvard's
penalties in the early stages of the con
test. Several times^'iurins: the first few
minutes of play he was offside, and one
of ills offenses would ha\ - e cost a touch
down had Harvard been playing against
a first-class team. In point of fumbling
both 'â¢earn? were about eqiia!. but Perm-
M'van'a was per.a!l**d three times to Har
vard's once for offside. The chief offender
!n this respect for Pennsylvania, was
Mitchell, who took Piek&rpkr* place. Time
and again he would plunce into the line
before the Harvard man had started and
Â¦the net result ot his overanxiety was a
gain of forty yards for Harvard. His
offense* finally became unbearable and he
tvas taken out of the game.
Never has so much feeling been shown
fn a game between these big universities
as was manifest this afternoon. There
â¢were numerous slugging matches, and
-ear the close of the game 'moire Da
shiel ordered Jordan out of the contest.

CHAMPION GREYHOUNDS ENTERED
FOR THE OPEN PLAINS STAKE

to Meet at Petaiurrp.
The drawing for the annual plains nn^t

day and Thursday, took place last night
sr Pythian Castle. Eighty-eight grt.y
hourds are entered, the largest number
rver entered for an open plain! event
since thÂ« inception of the event eleven
years ago.
It Tt-as thought before the drawing con.
menced that the number of dogs entered
would not exceed sixty-four. When it
was announced that r!ghty-Â«*lght dogÂ«?
had been entered the coursing men dis
played great glee, and as the names of
'he dogs entered were read the large
Towd present could hardly restrain its
?-nthuirlasm. ICev*-r In the history of open
plains meetings has such an entry b^n
made The dogs entered are in nearly
every case In the champion class. Another
feature which reassures the men who
"wn the dogs of a successful event 1*
the rain that fell yesterday. It will soften
the ground for the dogs and make the
running e&fer. .
The prizes are: To the winner, $200;
runner up. $12T.; third. V*>. next three. H't

i.PEEME COURT SEALS
TATE OF THE CODES
Petition for Rehearing Prepared by
Code Commissioner* and Inter
ested Lawyers Denied.
The Supreme Court put an end to all
dispute as to the legality of the revised
rode* yesterday by denying a petition for
c rehearing of the case presented by the
Code Commission and numerous lawyers
throughout the State.
When the decision was first renderel
consternation (seized the framers of Uls
new law*, and many outsiders who had
managed In some way or another to get
measures pasted which were of consid
erable personal benefit. As much legal
talent as could be obtained was lmma
dlately summoned to prepare argument*
and cite authorities enough to Influence
the Supreme Court to allow another hear
ing of th% matter.
But pleadings were In vain. The court
did not even take the trouble to hani
down a reason for its action. The fate of
the codes, which cost the State something
like $100,000 In salaries and consumed sev
en years of time In preparation, whs
wealed with the brief but portentous
merit â¢"Writ denied."
The legal lights have now thrown the
U." volumes out of their windows, and un
happy publishers who had a lot of the
costly books stored up for sale are saying

Rough Play.
Campbell finally consented to allow Jor
dan to resume his poeltion.
The new play which Coach Woodruff
had evolved will not revolutionize foot
ball. It was tried only twice during the
game and both times failed utterly. The
Fec-yÂ»t of the piny is for the quarter-back
to pass the ball to the half-back, who.
Just as he reaches the line, turns and
strikes the opposing forwards with hlÂ«
back. At this juncture the other half-back
comes along and. taking the ball, dives
into the line in the same manner. By
the time this second half-back got into
the lire to-day he was pinned down be
neath 1000 pounds of brawn and muscle.

REMARKABLE SPEED OF CRUZADOS
IN THE PRODUCE EXCHANGE STAKE
THE sensational win of the Pro
duce Exchange stakes for two
year-olds by Cruzados at Oak
land yesterday was the feature of
the snort. The turn of speed dis
played by the Baldwin colt was nothing
sh"rt of marvelous and probably a stake
vas never annexed in easier fashion.
Coupled in the betting with his stable
mate El Chihuahua, the ring laid 2% to
1 against the pair. When Holtman re
leased the barrier. Cruzados broko away
in the lead, with little Ransom Hlttim: up
straight in an endeavor to restrain the
bay fellow's speed. With the nrst half
mile covered in :47Â«Â» and the favorite
qiiilrtlisinim five lengths In his wake,
Cruzados gradually widened the gup of
daylight, until at the wire ho won by a
dozen open lengths, with a score of train

Â«fT the six furlongs in 1:13& None of the
other starters showed to any particular
advantage. The utake was worth $1200 to
the winner, which had been carefully pre
pared by W, J. Spiers.
I'osslbly the Inclemency of the weather
kept a few away, but not mniiy of the
r< trulars were' missing from the blp Sat
urday gathering.
Bomebotty placed a "copper" on thÂ«

the track two seconds slow to the mile.

within half a second of the record, leaving
behind such aristocrats as Joe Frey. Ha
gerdon and Royal Flush. Hagerdon did
not seem to be the horse he was some
day* ago, for, lying In third position, he
was all out when the straight for home
was reached. He closed an even money
choice and finished third. Frank Bell,
with TVlnslette on his back, skimmed
away in front and was never headed, dis
posing of Joe Frey by a length. Royal
Flush seemed surly and indisposed to run
for O'Connor.
Most of the handlcappers thought .111
pounds on Green Morris' mare, Janice,
would anchor her In the Plnkerton handi
cap, over a mile and a sixteenth. Some
of the other starters did not meet with
the best of racing luck and Janice, aided
by O'Connor's skill and 6 to 1 In the ring,
delivered the dry goods. Varro, a W
poundcr, made tho running for nearly a
mile and then went back and eat down.

too much out of him. At the last Brutal,

rom the rear, bringing O'Connor, on Jan-
Ice, to a fierce drive and losing by less
than a length. Barbara Frletchle and
Eangor, the equally-priced luke warm fa
vorites, were never dangerous.
Nannie Nolan, a Bt. Louis "trick" an 1
Â« to 1 in the betting, captured the final
mile selling run. .She assumed the front
position when half the route had bco'i

Hni* Northwestern universities had a fast,
fierce battle on the gridiron to-day and

although the score was Northwestern 6,
Chicago 5.

yards for a touchdown, following with a
goal kicked. Chicago's score was gained
In the second half, when Elbeworth kick

MANAGERS OF BOXERS MAY MEET
TO DISCUSS QUEENSBERRY RULES
All Parties Desire That There May Be No
Misunderstanding in the Ring.
A QUESTION has developed In the
Jeffrlcs-Ruhlln fight which will
necessitate a meeting of the prin
cipals cr their representatives to
Itttr It involves an interpreta
tion of the Marquis of Queensberry rules,
under which nil championship fights are
decided. "BU!y" Madden has strong Ideas
on these rules, as he was one of a com
mittee, of which J. B. Angle of the Na
tional Club of England was also a mem
ber, which 'interpreted" or amplllled the
original rule?.
Referee Harry Corbett has .suggested
that In view of the possible difference of
opinion as to what is meant by some of
the rules, the principals or their managers
meet and decide on their understanding
of the various points. Â¦ *
This will do away with any possible
misunderstanding In the ring, which
would cause unnecessary delay.
Jeffries did his first day's work in Oak
land yesterday. Quite a large gathering
of Fporttng men watched the big fellow
punch the bag and box with his sparring

marveled at his speed and expressed high
opinions upon his condition. The cham
pion arose early and took a long run
toward Lake Merritt. Upon returning to
the gymnasium he was rubbed down. In
he afternoon he went through his usual
exercises. He did enough work for two
men and wits not distressed.
Billy Madden said yesterday after Ruh
lin had finished his afternoon work In tht*
gymnasium that he had never seen his
protege looking so well nor in j better
physical shape to battle for the cham
pionship of the world. From this time
forth Ous will only do such work as will
keep him in health until the night of the
right. Little or no attempt will be mad o
to take off any more flesh. Ruhlin now
weighs an even 200 pounds and at that
weight he will probably enter the ring.

MEDIUM.
HE WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU CALLED
FORâ ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW.
So strange Is the work of "Oman" that,
without a word, without a question, he tells
you what you came for. Just what you want
to know. He gives names, dates, facts and
locations In the vast problems of life: correct
Information about all affairs, love, courtship,
marriage, divorce, sales, wills, property, old
estates, speculation, diseases, pensions, pat-
eats. Investments, etc.. In all their varied
and multifarious details. He recognizes none
as his su[>erior who by any means advises I
and foretells events arising through cause
and effect. His remarkable psychic power
has won for him a reputation that has been
accorded to but few.
BEWARE
Of pretenders and partially developed med-
iums. They copy his advertisements and In
many smaller cities use his name. They even
use his photograph attached to their adver-
tisements.
Please remember that WESLEY OP.MAN
can be seen only st his SAN FRANCISCO

City govern! Ktock Exchange broker*
were very large takers of election wagers on
th* New York City contest, which may have
bÂ«>n an Incentive to speculation. Hut the Im
portant underlying motive for the outburst was
the confident statements current that a definite
agreement had beÂ»n r. :...',. -i for the har
monization of the Northwoatam railroad quar
rel. The stocks concerned In that dispute
have made up the largest part of the specula
tion and the whole of the transcontinental
group has shown sympathy. Nothing haa been
learned from authoritative sources to show
how far railroads not Immediate parties to the
repute were to be affectc-d by the settlement,
.nit j.peculatlve Wall street has dun* to the
conviction that not only was the control of the
Burlington eyntern to be harmoniously adjusted
bftÂ»Â»*n the Union Pacific and the Northern
Pacific-Great Northern Interests, but that a
concord of operation was to bÂ« assured between
r all of the transcontinental lines. The actual
new* of the subject haa been confined to skill
ful surmise based on thÂ« price movement of
individual stocks and on the general tact that
[ the leading capitalists involved are agreed In
their admissions that the negotiations are pro
ceeding satisfactorily and that they promise
an agreement to Insure the interests of all
parties. No official Information of details has
been forthcoming and current surmises have
varied from day to day. giving opportunity
to professional operators in stocks to make
Fklllful use of the mystery for effective ma
nipulation.
The opinion ha* been gaining force in the
financial districts that the terms of the set
tlement which were to bear directly on the con
trol of Northern Pacific have worked back
to the direct control of Burlington Itself, which
, was the real prize that was sought through
out. If I'nlon Pacific were granted a propor
tionate share of holdings in Burlington llsrlf
it is easy to see how the problem ot financing
the project would be simplified and the object
furthered of r<-leaÂ»lng part of the enormous
capital which was locked up In the struggle for
control la.Â«t spring. The Union Pacific hold
ings of Northern Tactile would not be neces
sary for control of Burlington. The marketing
: of these holdings would. Indeed, be a for
; midable undertaking. The current rumors of
an intended increase in the dividend rate on
the Northern Pacific Mocks would run with
this explanation of the terms of the settle
ment. The stimulating effect of this develop
ment ha* given room for the play of a number
of other favoring forces on the stock market.
Reports of a phenomenal railroad traffic have
come from all sources and an urgency of Â¦de
mand for freight room, which has led to a
freight car famine on many lines. In some
industries, notably Iron and steel, the produc
tion on orders has only been limited by the
ability of railroads to deliver materials. Re
ports of general domestic trade conditions are
alto favorable. The gross earnings of rail
: roads for the fourth week of October show some
very large percentage increases over those for
the corresponding week of last year. A con
j siderable short interest in some of the stocks
recently usder pressure has been a technical
aid to the rising tendency. These conditions
have tended to obscure somewhat the money
question and the continued exports of gold,
without relaxing the stiffness of the foreign
exchange market, have been Ignored. This was
partly due to the hope that the largest part
of the foreign demand has been satisfied and
that currency would soon begin to return to
New York from the interior channels of circu
lation. The large receipts of Australian and
Klondike gold have run parallel with the with
drawals for export and the offerings of Gov
ernment bonds, though nrnall. are rtffflclent
to offset the current Government surplus with
drawn from the market. It is to be remem
bered that the Government surplus. - after run
ning light during the early part of last month,
became very large before the end of the month.
Europe's year-er.d requirements for money be

NEW YORK. Nov. Â».â The Financier aaya:
A fttrtking feature of that movement of money
which affected the bank statement of this week
Is that the net gain to the banks resulting from
Sub-Treasury operations, including payments
ti> these Institutions for bonds and for new
gold, less excess receipts by the Treasury on
the fiscal operations, nearly offset the loss to
the banks caused by gnld exports and the
movement of money, there being an estimated
net loss to the banks of only $374,000.
The banks gained fS.!Â£t.&oo through bond pay
ments and gold disbursed In assay office
checks, less transfers of money to the Wept
and South, and the banks lost to the Treasury
j:.74"..&00 through the excena of receipts by that
office for customs, internal revenue, etc.. over
payments on ordinary bunlnesa. leaving ac the
net gain to the banks from the Sub-Treasury
12.515.700. The banks lost through exports of.
gold $2,758,700 and through the direct interior
movement, less transfers. $631,000, making al
together $3.1&9.?C0. Hence the total estln>Ued
ln*s to the banks was $574,000. It Is noteworthy
that exports of gold were only $12,900 more
than the week's surplus revenues of the Sub-
Treasury. The bank utatement showed a loss
of $3,703,700 in cash. The discrepancy between
this amount and that estimated doubtless
arises from the fact that considerable sums
which were paid for bonds wen* distributed
to Institutions other than banks: otherwise that
the bank average system Is to a great extent
responsible for the difference. Loans decreased
$4,927,900, Indicating liquidation of exchange
loan contracts and deposits were diminished by
$7,643,100. or about $1.000,u00 less than the loss
of loans and of cash. The surplus reserve was
reduced $1. 792,785, now standing at $8,639,925.

WHEATâ The foreign markets remained
about the same. Paris future* were lower.
Chicago was easy, but no lower. Indifferent
cables encouraged the bears. The Southwest
sent bullish news, accompanied by buying
orders. Bradstreet's estimated that the world's
supply was 30,000,000 bushels less than at this
time last year. Private wires to this city ex
pressed anticipations for a continued large
foreign demand,- and said that the extensive
feeding to livestock would use up a good deal
of wheat.
This market was firmer on the spot and

This Big Doll Display Continues.
But added to them this week are doll buggies and go-carts.
We are spreading out these Christmas things because we've
got more space to show them now; then there are lots of folks
who like to buy early; they say they find more to see and less
to bother them. *
You'll be interested in these doll vehicles, for
They Are All So New and Pretty.
They embrace all the new ideas brought out this season.
' Many of them are modeled after the full-grown carriages.
