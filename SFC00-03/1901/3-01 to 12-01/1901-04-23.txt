The Union League Club is making exten

skill of professional decorators will be in
voked to render the club quarters attrac

will take place in the regular rooms of the
club.
Visit in Redlands.
REDLANDS. April 22.â President Mc-
KInley and his party will ride through
Redlands. The line of drive has been
changed by the committee of the Board
of Trade so that the President will enter
Canyon Crest Park at the Highland-ave
nue entrance, instead of from Serpentine
drive, as first planned, because the. roses
on the Serpentine were the main attrac
tion for using the east entrance to the
park, and now they, are out of .bloom.
Mr. Bradley's "Little Kite" road also will
be visited by the Presidential party on
its way through - Terracina to town. . At
the suggestion of the Board of Trade the
Messrs. Smiley have consented to f have
Smiley Heights closed to all .visitors on
the morning of the President's visit there.
Guards will be placed at all entrances to
keep visitors out until after the Presi
dential party has taken the drive. â¢

"There Is no lack of willingness on the

General Warfleld made a suggestion last
evening concerning the banquet. In his
opinion that event ought to be made to net
the sum of $10,000, approximately. He says
that there are undoubtedly 1000 persons in
California who would gladly pay $20 each
for the honor of being present at the Pres
idential banquet. The rate of $10 per plate
Is ample to make It first class In every re

of the reception and accompanying cere

The Philippine Veterans.
General R. H. "VVarfleld, chairman of
the parade committee, has, with his com
mittee, taken steps to have the soldiers
now in San Francisco recently returned
from the Philippines and also those who
are due to return within the next few
days from the southern seas take part in
the parade. There are now In San Fran
cisco 9000 veterans who have marched un
der Uncle Sam's banner In the Philip
pines, who are about to be discharged.
Undoubtedly there are thousands of them

Dispatches have been sent to Secretary
of War Root and Adjutant General Cor

until after the arrival of the President,
that they may add their presence to the
occasion. Congressman Kahn has tele
graphed to "Washington in reference to
this matter and other Influences are at
work in the same direction. The parade
committee will meet next Saturday fore
noon at the office of Irving M. Scott and
there and then will discuss its plans. The
procession will be purely military, em
bracing the Philippine veterans and other
regular troops at the Presidio and the
Second Brigade of the National Guard of

and highly interesting pageant.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 22.â The celebrated
voyage around the world by Captain Jo
siah Slocum in his forty-foot sloop Daunt
less has been matched by the wedding
trip of Roy Ovaett, a lad of 19. Single
handed, Ovaett sailed an eighteen-foot
sloop from Seattle to Seward City, which
is near Juneau, Alaska. Then he put
about and beat his way home again, ar
riving here less than a week ago. Captain
Slocum sailed with a fully provisioned and
thoroughly equipped boat. Roy Ovaett
had scanty supplies, $10 in money,, not a
stick of spare canvas nor a foot of extra
spars and a young wife to care for. That
in'brief is the story. Told in detail the
narrative would make a book.
Ovaett is a modest young chap, with
clear blue eyes and a frank smile. His
wife is a beautiful young woman. She
was Meg Goodell before her marriage, and
the long months at sea have only added
to the charm of her face.
Sailed Away Last July.
The young couple were married early
in last July andÂ«fl. few days later the hus
band went to Frank Faber, who owns the
Brighton boathouse, and rented a sloop
named the Ultra. He told , Faber he was
going for a wedding trip, and the sloop
was provisioned for a two weeks' cruise.
The Ultra left port on the 28th of . last
July. Three weeks later Faber received a
letter from Allard Bay, in which Ovaett
'announced* thai^he-was sroing-to/take' his
wife to Alaska, and that 'he was not com
ing back.
From the day of her departure the Ultra
was not spoken by any craft. She disap
peared as completely as if she had sunk
to the bottom of the Pacific. And that is
what in time people came to believe was
her fate. ; â¢
' Mrs. Ovaett. nrlor to her marriage, had
lived with her grandmother, Mrs. Goodell,
in a little cottage close by the water front.
Mrs. Goodell gave up her grandchild as
dead and young .Ovaett's family mourned
for him as one lost to them forever.
Return of the Ultra.
A week ago the Ultra sailed jauntily up
the bay and dropped anchor off the Brigh
ton boathouse. Many things happened
during the long voyage to Alaska. There
were storms and head winds. Provisions
ran shortâ perilously short at times. Once
they lived for two days on a handful of
clams. On another occasion the Ultra
staggered along in the teeth of a gale un
til her trysail parted, and for thirty-nine
hours this boy stood at the tiller, holding
her head close to the wind. Had the Ultra
fallen off she would have upset.
Sitting in his cozy home this afternoon
Ovaett told the story of his wonderful
cruise along the shore of the North Pacific
to Seward, Alaska; After working his
way out _ into the ocean from Pug-et
Sound he took what is known as the inner
passage to Alaska. That he was not
wrecked a dozen times was due to vigi
lance and the numerous sheltered nooks
along the irregular passage.
Venison for Their I/arder. *
His two weeks' provisions were made to
cover a much longer period by the prac
tice of economy. and the addition of fish
and deer meat. Ovaett had no trouble ob
taining plenty of fish and when the meat
larder ran low he resorted to the old fash
ioned plan of "jacking" -for deer.. There
are many places along the coast even how
where deer may be killed with compara
tive ease. Ovaett had a gun with him,
and owing" to the necessity of making each
shot tell, got good results.
The sloop touched at Allard bay, from
which point Mrs. Ovaett was sent home
by steamer, while Ovaett sailed" home
without assistance. Â¦ - '

BUFFALO, April 22.â A detailed inspec
tion of the buildings of the Pan-American
Exposition to-day showed that the only
real damage done by the heavy -winds and
snow of Saturday night was the breaking"
of some skylights of the conservatory of

Concerning the outdoor floral display,
Architect Ulrich maintains that the flow

CINCINNATI, April 22.â Alarm over tha
flood has almost ceased in the lower Ohio
valley. The low water mark in 'the Ohio
below this city has' allowed the floods
from up the river to flow rapidly toward
the Mississippi. The situation is still
serious up . the river,: notably at Rlpley,
Marysville, Aberdeen, Portsmouth. Hang-
Ing Rock, Ironton, Ashland, CatUetts
burg, Huntington, Point Pleasant, Pome
roy, Marietta, Parkersburg and some
other places, between Wheeling and Cin
cinnati. The crest of the flood is below
Wheeling to-night and the further down
stream it gets the lower Is the rate of
risjng. . Â¦ Â¦
The uniform rate of three Inches per
hour this morning fell to two Inches be
fore noon and as low as one and a half
inches an -hour at Point Pleasant at 2 p.
m: This decrease in the rate did not ex
tend far below Point Pleasant, so that it
will: be another day before it reaches
Portmouth. Ironton. Ashland, Cattletts
burg and Huntington, where there aro al
ready serious conditions. It usually takes
the crest of the flood two days to reach
Cincinnati from Point Pleasant, but the
present 'unobstructed flow is much more
rapid than in former floods. At Ports
mouth to-night fifty-five, feet was reported
and that means serious conditions at
points below Portsmouth. The Weather
Bureau indicates that the. flood will not
exceed fifty-tight feet at any time at
Cincinnati, and possibly it may not reach
fifty-seven feet. It is over fifty-two feet
to-night and the maximum will not be
reached before to-morrow night or Wed
nesday. This is about ten feet less than
was anticipated here until the river be
gan falling last night at Pittsburg.
Not as Bad as Former Floods.
The flood is not' as bad as In a^uozen
former years and much below the record
of 1897 and 1898, and those of 1S83 and 1S84.
The former floods were earlier, when the
weather was cold, causing much distress
among the homeless people. While this
flood is not so hard on the people driven
from their homes, it is much harder on the
crops and fruits that are well advanced.
The property loss in the rural districts
cannot be estimated. It will be very large.
The homeless people will not be kept
away from their houses as long as they
were during former floods, which in some
cases have lasted as many weeks in the
winter as this will continue days in the
spring. The highest stage will be reached
at Parkersburg to-morrow, and here the.
next day and at the mouth of the Ohio
before the week is out.
The Weather Bureau here to-night
gave out the statement that the Ohio
River in the Cincinnati district generally
was above the danger line from one foot
at Cincinnati to fourteen feet at Point
Pleasant and rising at an average of two
inches an hour. It indicates that the rise
would continue at Cincinnati until Wed
nesday, when the river will become sta
tionary and soon begin falling. The
Bureau predicts fifty- four feet here to
morrow moraine and fifty-six to-morrow
evening.
Heavy Losses Are Sustained.
The most encouraging Information re
ceived by the Weather Bureau was from
Parkersburg. where there was a rise of
only one foot all day and a stage of only
forty-two feet was recorded where the
local river men had anticipated forty
eight. It. was expected that >the river
would begin falling at Parkersburg to
morrow. At Point Pleasant, another criti
cal place farther down the river, the
water was rising much more slowly.
At Pomeroy. which is located In a great
bend, the suffering to-night Is reported
less than in former floods. The large
furnaces of the salt trust are located here,
and they have suffered much loss, aÂ»
well as the lumbermen, the electric in
ter-urban lines, the light and other cor
porations. - Similar conditions exist at
MInersville, but all the points In the
Pomeroy Bend have escaped. The reports
from other up-river points that suffered
so severely during other floods indicate
that no outside help is needed, that there
has been no loss of life except in' acci
dental drownlngs from shanty boats and
that there is no distress for want of food
or shelter.
HIGH WATER IMPEDES TRAFFIC
Is Done Along the Ohio.
At Cincinnati Considerable Damage
CINC1NNATT, April 23.â The stage of
the river here at 6 o'clock to-night was
fifty-one feet and rising at the rate of two
inches an hour. This means fifty-three
feet at 6 o'clock to-morrow morning, when
trains will be shut off from the Grand
Central station. The roads using that sta
tion have already arranged to use the
Fourth and Eighth street stations to-mor
row. All the railways have also made ar
rangements for receiving and delivering
freight at higher stations so that there
will be no Interruption here either to pas
senger or freight traffic. Owing to the in
ability of the eteamers to get under the
bridges, navigation on the river is sus
pended, but the predicted subsidence of
the flood will probably permit a resump
tion of river traffic by Thursday.
Owing to washouts, the Cincinnati.
Portsmouth and Virginia Railway cannot
run trains.
The residents of the tenement houses
along the Ohio River front were run out
of the first storJes when the river reached
a stage of forty-five feet last night. "What
Is known as the danger line of fifty feet
was not reached until 1 o'clock to-day,
since which time the jobbers, warehouses
and manufacturers in the lower part of
the city have been suffering. The flooding
of basements wJll compel many manufac-
turers to shut down for two or three d-*ys.
The river here was rising at the rate of
three inches an hour this moning. The
flood is unobstructed In tne lower Ohio, and
there Is less backwater, than usual, which
conditions give hope that the trouble will
be of short duration. It 13 settled now that
if a second rise from the Allegheny re
gion comes it will not overtake the pres
ent flow. So far the damage here has
been limited to the lumbermen and others
located along the river front.
Mayor Fleischmann. Chief of Police
Deitsch, Health Officer Davis and other9
inspected the flooded district to-day in
patrol wagons and boats, and arranged for
the relief of all who were in need. An ex
tra police was put on In the flooded dis
tricts, and the police boat patrols will be
on the river front to-morrow.
The endless lino of shanty boats and
other craft along the river front have
been swept away, but so far without loss
The " country along 1 thÂ© Little Miami
River is badly flooded Just east of the
city.
At Newport and Dayton. Ky.. many peo
ple have been driven from their homes.
The waterworks of Newport are unable
to do pumping, but the reservoir is full
and no trouble -is expected during the
short duration of the flood. It is now set
tled that the Newport race traÂ£k -Â«|llnot
be flooded. Tho races are proceeding^crV*

Dollars.
PITTSBURG, April 22.â The flood la
over. Notwithstanding tho fact that early
In the day there was every evidence of a
renewal of the high water, the announce
ment can be made authoritatively to
night that there is not the least danger
of another rise at this point nor above
for the present, but towns on the Ohio
River below here are not yet out of dan
ger because of rains in tha valley last
nicht and to-day.
All up-river points report the rain as
having ceased and the river falling 1 . ThÂ©
Ohio registered 19.8 at the dam here at
7 o'clock and was falling. Forecaster
Ridgeway says It would require a steady
downpour of rain for twenty-four hour3
to check the fall, and from present Indi
cations such a thing Is not ukely.
The rivers about this city are down so
that the works along- the banks are run
ning. There is a good deal of cleaning
up to be done. The flood brought in much
slimy mud that it left when it receded,
and it will reaulra a day of two to re
move it from many of the mills and clean,
tho machinery.
The creeks and runs -which did so much
damage in the outlying districts on Satur
day are back well wltoln their banks to
night. Carnegie Is rapidly cleaning up
and repairing Dridges, houses and roads.
The same state of affairs exists at Mo

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., April 22.â With
stump speeches in nearly every county in
the State, the campaign for a constitu
tional convention closed to-day. A gen
eral election will be held to-morrow, and
indications point to an overwhelming vic
tory for the advocates of the new con
stitution.
The principal change, and practically
the only change to be made in the con
stitution, is the elimination of the negro
vote by educational qualification. On this
point the political contest has been
fought, and there is organized opposition
to the new constitution In some of the
counties. The Democrats who are behind
the movement for radical change in suf
frage laws, feel confident of success. The
Democratic party has pledged itself, to
see that no white man will -be disfran
chised under the constitution which they
hope to have adopted.

NEW YORK, April 22.â The directors of
the Missouri Pacific Railroad at a meeting
to-day authorized an increase of $30,000,000
in the capital stock, making the total
authorized $100,000,000. A stockholders'
meeting will be held shortly to ratify this
action.
It was reported that a large part of the
new-st&ck would be available for taking
up Denver and Rio Grande preferred and
common shares. Information as to the
price of issue or other details could not
be obtained from the company's offices.
The Missouri Pacific's present outstand
ing capital is $50,432,000. The authorize'";
amount was increased to $70,000,000 about*
a year ago, but it was then stated that
the increase was made because Missouri
,laws required a certain ratio between the
bonds and stocks, of corporations to be
maintained. The new stock then author

time. . Â¦-. , ... 4
The Denver and Rio Grande stock out

will be increased to $44,000,000 at the spe
cial shareholders' meeting called for May
15 to provide for the Rio Grande Western
purchase. Of this new stock $12,500,000 Is
to be issued at once for cash, for the Rio

sumably the greater share of the amount
reserved will be held for exchanging Rio

MEMPHIS, Tenn.. April 22.â The fast
express train of the Choctaw. Oklahoma
and Gulf Railroad, which left Memphis
at 11:40 o'clock to-night, was held up t>y
three masked bandits at Bridge Junction,
Ark., about midnight. It is not known
Â¦what booty the robbers secured, but a dis
patch received at police headquarters
stated that the express messenger .and
porter of the train were injured after re
sisting the bandits. The Wells-Fargo Ex
press Company usually makes its heaviest
shipments to the West on this train. Po
lice Sergeant Perry, upon receipt of the
telegram, Immediately posted officers
along the river front with instructions to
keep a sharp lookout for the bandits,
should they attempt to cross to the city. '
The train left Memphis with a heavy
passenger list. The scene of the hold-up
is a lonely railroad crossing about four
miles from the river. It is said that the
negro porter was shot by one of the ban
dits aod Is in a serious condition.
The Train was in charge of Conductor
Nelson, one of the oldest employes of the
road, and Engineer Johnston. The ex
press messenger. Meadows, is said to have
been shot, but It cannot be learned if any
valuables were secured. The negro por
ter, Gould, was shot and is in a critical
condition. 'The train was delayed about
twenty minutes.
Bloodhounds from the convict camp at
Hulbert, three miles from the scene, are
now on the bandits' trail.
The engine, mail and " express car ' were
cut off from the train and run to a point
half a mile west of the place where the
train was stopped. The engine was then
detached and run a short distance up the
track, two men remaining cuard over the
trainmen. The third used dynamite on
the exoress car and blew open the doors.
It is reported that everything of value in
the express car was taken and it is be
lieved that the bandits' haul is large, as
this was a. heavy run.

Politics Centers â¢ Interest.
: To-day the real work.pf the Grand Par
lor commenced, but the session was con
fined to routine business, such as the ap
pointment of committees and the accept
ance of credentials. Between times the
visitors made side trips about town or
discussed Grand Parlor matters in quiet
corners. Â¦ . . .
So far as contests for office go. the chief
interest surrounds the fight for grand
orator, an honor now held by H. R. Mq-
Noble of Stockton. Judge Charles E. Mc-
Laughlin of Quincy and Judge M. T. Dool
ing of Hollister, both grand trustees, are
candidates for the honor. As a side at
traction there is the candidacy of S. A.
D. Jones of San Francisco for grand sec
retary, a position filled for so many years
by Henry Lunstedt, also of the bay city.
This afternoon the delegates " to ! the
Grand Parlor vere driven about this city
and Montecito and along the mountain
boulevard. Three hundred availed of
this privilege and enjoyed the trip im
mensely. The newspaper men were the
guests of Don Dixie w. Thompson, one of
the most noted pioneers on the coast. Don

BERLIN, April 22.â With , reference Â¦ to
the statements: cabled from the United
States of a plot said to have been con
cocted against Emperor William and oth
er European rulers by anarchists of Ar
gentina and New Jersey extreme reti
cence is observed in official circles in Ber
lin, ; , ;
After careful investigation, however, a
correspondent ascertained in a reliable
quarter that the Berlin police presidency
issued, an order April 6 for the arrest,
whenever or wherever caught, of the al
leged anarchist, Rodolfo Romagnoli, alias
Romalisso, alias Langwick Mueller. The
order simultaneously requested all inland
and foreign authorities to Â¦ assist in ap
prehending Romagnoli. Photographs of
the alleged anarchist, with a minute de
scription after the Bertillon method, were
furnished for identification.
The information received by the Berlin
authorities waa that Romagnoli had -been
formally chosen . by the alleged conspira
tors in Paterson, N. J., to murder Em
peror "William. They were furthermore
informed that he left Buenos Ayres March

California's first public school teacher,
read a poem .written by her father for this
occasion. It was entitled "Hall, Native
Sons," and was greatly appreciated by the
native hearers.
City Attorney Booth's , address of wel
come was in part as follows:
It seems to me that it Is peculiarly appro
priate that Santa Barbara should have been
chosen by you as a gathering: place. , As a
village in early days, it played no Inconspicu
ous part In the making of California history.
Our State, more especially the southland, is
thoroughly cosmopolitan; It Is now peopled by
men .and. women most' of whom have owed their
allegiance to other sovereign States. And in
the haste of to-day we, the later dwellers, are
apt to forget, the struggles of those pioneers
who. made it possible for us.to/now enjoy the
blessings of a stable government, a fruitful
land, a rich commonwealth. It' is, due. to their
memory that from among their sons and
daughters spring up. fraternal orders
whose members have the common heritage
of pluck and endurance that carved from an
unknown land the imperial State of California.
Tribute to the Pioneers.
Reflect but a moment on the deeds of the
pioneers and one must exclaim, "Ah, my mas
ters, there were men!" Hen who made the
wildernets blossom as the rose; who wrested
from stubborn nature the secrets of prosperity;
who turned over the virgin soil to see spring
from it fragrant orchards and waving grains:
who compelled the "gray and melancholy"
waste of ocean to ray tribute to them, the
stern and forbidding mountains to reveal hid
den riches surpassing those of fabled Golconda.
To the sons and daughters of these pioneers
It is my privilesre on behalf of the city of
Santa Barbara to extend a welcome heartfelt
and a genuine "last toast and of obligationâ a
health to the native born." ,
After the reception those of the visit
ing natives who are also Elks responded
to an invitation from the local lodge of
Elks and attended a high jinks reception
at Elks Hall. Banqueting- and toasts
were the order of the entertainment till
near morning.

WILLIAM FEARS
AN ANARCHIST
PEKING. April 22.-General Voyron, the
commander of the French troops in China,
has Informed General Chaffee that 10,000
French soldiers will leave China In May.
Li Hung Chang believeB that the Chinese
troops under General Liu will be with
drawn over the boundary marklnj? the
territory defined by Field Marshal von
TValdersee as the sphere of operations for
the allies, as the Governor of Shansi prov
ince received telegraphic instructions
nearly a week ago ordering their with
drawal. The Governor could have con
veyed this order to the troops in question
by last Friday at the latest. Â¦
The majority of the French and German
newspaper correspondents accompanying
the expedition directed against General
Liu. and which has been mobilized at
Paotlngfu, returned to Peking to-day, be
lieving that the expedition would be called
off.
Hsi Liang, formerly Governor of the
province of Shansi, has been appointed
Governor of the province of Hupei. The
foreign consuls at Hankow, capital of the
province of Hupei, have protested against
this appointment to Chang Chi Tung,
Viceroy of Hankow, and have sent a tele
gram advising him to delay proceeding in
the matter of Hsl Liang's appointment.
Civilians Are Alarmed.
The numerous appointments of China
men with pronounced anti-foreign ten
dencies is creating comment at Peking.
Even the foreign Ministers admit that so
many appointments of this character are
ill-advised, while the missionaries and
other civilians are alarmed for the future.
It Is the opinion of Mr. Rockhill. the
American special commissioner, that the
foreign troops may now commence leav-
Inj? China with perfect safety. . On the
other hand the announcement that 10,000
French troops are to leave in May causes
fear among the French native converts
and French residents.
The views of the foreign Ministers ..on the
withdrawal of the troops are not shared
by the great majority of the foreign resi
dents. The Ministers aver that some of
these latter have business reasons and
others would have to vacate the line
buildings they are now occupying rent
free when the troops go.
Would Protect the General.
A personage from Sianfu, who Is closely
connected with the court, denies that Gen
eral Tung Fuh Siang is in a state of open
rebellion. The person in question thinks
that the missionaries who reported that
he was In rebellion must have heard ac
counts of his harsh treatment of bandits
falling into his hands. He has frequently
disobeyed orders of the court. When 5000
troops were withdrawn from his com
mand last January he should have re
turned their rifles and ammunition. This
he failed to do. Before he left for Kansu
he obtained an audience with the Em
press. Upon this occasion he said to the
Km press:
"All that your servant has done has
been to obey the orders of the court. He
will die upon the battlefield in your ser
vice. If, because of the commands of the
foreigners, your servant were committed
to death he would die unwillingly."
To this the Empress replied
"Let your heart be at peace. I would
rather lose my rivers and mountains than
you. I will surely devise a plan for your
protection."
Court Advisers Not in Accord.
The same informant says that the court
advisers are not in accord.
Lu Chuan Lin. a notorious reactionary
and president of the Board of Trade,
argues in favor of subduing the barbari
ans, while others advise delay in return
ing to Peking. Only Weng Weng Shao
and Sun Chian Nai, urge immediate ac-:
ceptance of the terms offered privately.
Two of the foreign powers have separate
ly agreed to extend to the court the fuil
protection, should necessity arise, of
every soldier they have.
At a recent meeting of the council both
the Emperor and the Empress wept fre
quently. The Dowager Empress said that
each day of absence was a day when ehe
could neither eat nor sleep in peace. The
Emperor said that Peking was the home
of his ancestors and that he could not
bear to abandon it.
i Sir Robert Hart's plan for the in
crease of the revenue of China would
bring in 20,000,000 taels annually, but the
foreigners and business men of China ob
ject to this plan, saying that under it
the foreign business houses will pay the
greater portion of the indemnity.
DEMAND POTJB MOBE HEADS.
Ministers Also Desire Degradation of
Eighty Officials.
PEKING. April 22.â The Ministers of
England. France, America, Holland, Bel
gium and Italy, to whom the question of
provincial punishment was assigned, to
day submitted a report to the diplomatic
corps that. they demand four more be
headings and punishment by exile, and
the degradation of eighty more officials.
The demand was immediately sent by the
diplomatic corps to the Chinese plenipo
tentiaries.
LONDON, April 23.â "According to Rus
sian advices." says the St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Times, "Prince Tuan
has utterly failed to produce a, rising
among the inhabitants of Mongolia, who
are kept quiet by a wholesome respect for
Russia. It is therefore declared to be un
true that an insurrection has broken out
in Mongolia." â¢ j
BERLIN. April 22.â It is believed in
German official circles that Russia will
take up negotiations with China again
regarding the Manchuria convention after
the general Chinese question is settled.
It is also believed officially that the Chin
ese regular army is already retreating be
fore the expedition which is under way,
and that the allied commanders are now
discussing what troops they can send
home.
ACTIVITY IN MANCHURIA.
Chinese Troops Are Strongly En-
trenched Around Mukden.
LONDON, April 21â According to a dis
patch from St. Petersburg to the Daily
Mail official information has been received
that renewed military activity is begin
ning in Manchuria. Chinese troops are
strongly entrenched j at three points
around Mukden. They are armed with
good Mauser rifles and have thirty Krupp
guns.
To the eastward of Mukdftn. near Tar
chause,n, there are 12,000 men under the
chief Boxer, General Lutanz. To the
northwest, near Kulo, there are 6000 Chi
nese under the former" Governor of Muk
den. To the eastward in Mongolia and
near the In-Shan mountain there are 900^
more under the Chinese General Schu.

Admiral Aliexoff has accordingly organ

movement was successfully carried out in
the beginning of April. Kulo, which is 250

I 7I8 Market Street. IMANILA, April 22.â A representative of
the Associated Press visited .Kmilio
Aguinaldo this afternoon at 56 Solano
street, where he was removed from the
Malacanan Palace, and found him in a
large room upstairs, furnished with a table
typewriting machine, four settees and
twenty chairs. His wife, who was enter
taining a number of Filipino women
friends, sat at one end of the room, while
Aguinaldo,- smoking a cigar and chatting
with Benlto Legardo, occupied the oppo
site corner.
- Others present were Lieutenant Colonel
John S. Mallory of the Forty-first Volun
teer Infantry, who has charge of Aguin
aldo; Lieutenant Gilbert A. Youngberg of
the Third Artillery and Mr. Fisher, Gen
eral MacArthur*s private secretary. !
Â¦Aguinaldo, whose bearing was courteous
and dignified, was dressed in white, looked
well and altogether made an excellent Im
pression. - Legardo, who but recently re
turned from the United States, talked of
the - trip, and Aguinaldo, who seemed
greatly interested, smiled and asked nu
merous questions. He inquired particu
larly as to what President McKinley said
and seemed anxious, to know -what Â¦was
thought of him in the United States.
He was rather reluctant to talk for pub
lication and considered every question
particularly before answering. He said
he was doing- all he could to assist in the
pacification of the Filipinos and expressed
himself as surprised at what the Amer
icans had accomplished. When he was
first captured, he went on to say, he was
greatly astonished to find that a majority
of the Filipinos entertained the opinion
that American sovereignty was preferable
to independence, but now he was inclined
to believe that way ! himself.

The American forces had a hard time
compelling the Panay Island natives to
surrender, and finally orders camo to de
stroy everything. Keegan says a dog

our forces finished the work of desolation
\vhen the island had been made barren
the natives surrendered. Keegan believes
the United States will be compelled to
carry out the Spanish custom of garrison
lnr- the small towns?, owing to the treach
erous character of the natives.
The Twenty-sixth was stationed at
Iloilo, island of Panay, and it was here
that Maurice first saw bullets sped at
human targets. He Is the only Califor
nian in the regiment, most of the men in
the Twenty-sixth being of Massachusetts
blood. The regiment went out with 1300
men and came back 900 strong. Only six
were killed in battle, but nearly 400 re
turned sick and wounded. The men ex
pect to be discharged in a few weeks.
Young Keegan tells of a number of
skirmishes and battles in which his regi
ment was engaged. In one battle the
American forces numbered 4000, while the
insurgents were strongly entrenched near
Jaro with 8000 men. They would not aim,
but raised their rifles over the trenches
and fired, the result being that their bul
lets went wide. Every insurgent found
dead in the trenches was shot in the fore
head, which proved that they did not ex
pose much of themselves. When the
Americans charged, the natives ran for
the tall grass.

Superior Sunset companies over the own
ership of the land that caused the bloody
conflict of last Thursday night has been
amicably settled by representatives of the
companies, and in consequence the possi
bility of another clash between the Supe
rior Sunset forces and the Vigilantes is
now at an end. This afternoon a Superior
Sunset man, with full powers, approached
the Mount Diablo Company and made
overtures for peace and a settlement. The
proposition was promptly accepted by the
Mount Diablo people and word was at
once wired to McKittrick to send out a
courier to notify the officers of the Vigi
lantes that peafe had been proclaimed.
The Superior Sunset men soon afterward
started a fast rider to their laager in Mid
way with a similar inessase, but it was
so arrang-ed that he was to arrive there
after the Vigilantes had been informed of
the triumph of peace.
In brief, the Superior Sunset people ad
mitted that they were wrong in going
upon the land and asked that they be
leased eighty acres where their camp is
now located. They were given the lease
and will now. as soon as the instrument
is drawn, proceed to exploit the land in
peace.
It was agreed to dismiss the Injunction
proceedings instituted against the Mount
Diablo as soon as the lease was signed,

GATHERING TO PLOT
AGAINST WICKEDNESS
SEATTLE, April 22.â John Williams, an
Alaska pioneer of 1SS2 and one of the best
known prospectors and miners of the
northern country, arrived in Juneau on
April 15 to give himself up to the Federal
authorities, making the confession that at
Glacier Bay on April 2 he had shot and
killed an Indian named Dick Dunn, after
a desperate encounter. The Indian was
well known In Juneau, where he had
borne a fairly good reputation and was
noted for his physical strength. The cir
cumstances leading: up to the affray in
which he was killed indicate, that Dick
Dunn, became suddenly insane and pos
sessed of a homicidal mania.
"Williams hired Dunn at- Juneau last
month to accompany him on a prospect
ing trip to the Glacier Bay district. The
pair left Juneau in a rowboat. A small
sail was hoisted, with the Indian steering
and "Williams seated in the bow of the
boat. When they had nearly reached their
destination Williams, whose back was to
ward the Indian, was startled by the re
port of a rifle and the whiz of a bullet
past his head. Turning In surprise he
Inquired of Dunn why he had shot, and
the Indian, pointing over the bow, said
he had seen a seal ahead and had taken
a shot at it. At the tinte Williams
thought nothinc of the occurrence.
Indian Sharpens His Knife.
They made camp on "the shore of Gla
cier Bay. In tha evening the Indian pre
ceded Williams in the tent and when "Wil
liams attempted to enter he was again
startled by seeing the rifle In the hands
of Dunn, pointed directly at him. Wil
liams save a well and started back from
the entrance, but the Indian again made
a ready excuse, saying he believed it was
some one else coming in.
The night passed without mishap and
during the next day the Indian sharpened
his knife, with the remark that It was not
sharp enough to cut .Williams' neck. This,
with other remarks, caused Williams some
uneasiness, and he could not sleep on re
tiring. After lying awake some time he
heard the click of the Indian's double
barreled shotgun. As he arose to a sit
ting position and inquired what was the
matter the Indian covered him and de
manded his rifle, saying that it was Wil
liams he was afraid of. ; '.
Realizing the meaninsr of the past ac
tions of the Indian, Williams swung his
rifle around and flred. The report of the
Indians' weapon and his own sounded at
the same time. Before he could rise the
Indian leaped upon him with knife in
hand.
Bullet Ends the Combat.
Williams, .who -is a smaller man. was
completely smothered by the heavy In
dian. For a time he was nearly helpless
and he no doubt would have had little
chance for his life had not his revolver
come to hand by the overturning of his
bedclothes. Calling vainly to the Indian
to desist and seeing no way to overcome
the maniac, he placed the revolver to
Dunn's breast and killed him. â¢
Early in the morning after the affray
Williams started on the return trip to Ju
neau.. He experienced considerable diffi
culty in managing the heavy boat against
head winds and among the strong cur
rents, and it was eleven days before he
reached his destination. He immediately
gave himself to the authorities and told
the details of the killing. It was not be
lieved in Juneau at the time the steam
ship Victorian.- which arrived here on
Sunday, left that port that any further
investigation would be made into the mat
ter.

EASY VICTORY ON MAT
ST. LOUIS, April 22.â Nouroulah, the gi-
gantlc Bulgarian, gained an easy victory
over Charles Wittmer, the Cincinnati
heavyweight wrestler, at the Exposition
Coliseum to-night, winning two straight
falls in exactly five minutes. The match
was catch-as-catch-can, best two in three
falls, all holds to go. The European's im
mense bulk and science were altogether
too much for the Cincinnatian to, combat
successfully. In the first bout Nouroulah
back-heeled Wittmar and fell upon him
with his whole weight. He secured a
crotch hold, which he switched to a half
hitch and after a short stuggle pinned
both of Wlttmar's shoulders to the mat.
Time, 2:00.
Coming on for the second fall, Wittmer
secured a strangle hold, which the Bul
garian easily broke and then threw 'Witt
mer to 'the mat. Â¦ The Cincinnatian strug
gled out of half a dozen holds, but Nour
oulah finally encompassed him in a half-
Nelson and half-hammer, which gave him
the victory. Time, 3:00. Nouroulah tipped
the beam at 354 and Wittmer at 215 pounds.
swing to the stomach. After several exchanges
in the center of the ring McGovern sent a hard
left to the jaw that sent Gardner's head back
with a snap. Both landed lefts to the face at
the gong. . â¢ ,'.-'. .
Terry cut the pace In the second and nailed
both hands to the body. In a rally both reached
the head with rights. Terry worked, his man
over to a-corner and put half a dozen swings
to stomach and jaw. With a hard right. he
sent Oscar down. Terry then cut his eye open
with a left swing and sent him down twice
more with right-hand punches. Two more
rights made Oscar go to the floor again and
he almost fell out of the ring, going partly
through the ropes. McGovern would not be
denied and landed a terrific right, swing fairly
to the chin, sending . the Omaha man down
a sain. Oscar was weak and tired when he re
gained his feet and was almost done for. The
bell saved . him. Gardner was put down five
times in that round.
Terry started with a rush In the third and
feinted- with his right and then snapped left
and right to the chin quickly. Oscar gave him
another opening on the next feint and McGov
ern started a left low and swung- it fiercely to
the jaw. Gardner sank to the . canvas on his
back and lay there immovable. The referee
stood over him and tolled off the fateful ten
and it was all over. Time of round nineteen
seconds. Oscar's seconds carried him to his
corner, where he recovered after a short while.
Rush, for Seats.
. The sale of seats for the fight opened
yesterday and the rush gives ample proof
that Mechanics' Pavilion will be crowded
to the doorsÂ» on the night of the great
featherweight battle. Orlando Stevens,
the champion cyclist, called' on. Manager
Kennedy of the Twentieth Century Club
yesterday and reported that a large crowd
of Garden City sports would attend the
fight. The railroad company notified
Stevens that if he would guarantee sixty
fares they would furnish a special train
to take the fiEht-goers home after the
battle.
McGOVERN has changed his
training quarters. The little
whirlwind and his retinue of
trainers moved from the Casino
yesterday to the Terminal Ho
tel, corner Haight and Stanyan streets,
and now all those wishing to see the
champion in action will either have to
come prepared with "credentials or wait
until the night of his battle with Gardner.
Manager Harris has found that this "rule
must be made as the curious have come
in such numbers that McGovern and his
assistants have been practically crowded
out of their, gymnasium.
The new training quarters are perfectly
satisfactory to McGovern. The spacious
gymnasium, the business-like punching
bag platforms and muscle-making appar
atus pleased him greatly. He jolted the
bag a few times, tried the wrist machine
and smiled blandly. . . -. â¢
Dnkelpw Takes a Rest.
McGovern worked hard yesterday after
noon. He sparred with Dougherty and a
youth named Healy, punched the bag and
side-stepped around the room more than
an hour. Dukelow, the amateur welter
weight, was given a rest for the nonce
but McGovern warned him that he -would
warm him up te-day. Dukelow smiled
grimly and remarked that he was glad
to report that he had not lost one of his
gold teeth up to this time, but added that
he would not crow unil he was out of the
woods. ~v .- .
Sam Harris, manager of McGovern and
Dougherty, denied the statement that
Dougherty was down too fine. He says
that Danny has not started to train and
that he is heavier now than ever before in
his lifetime. Harris said that Dougherty
always looked drawn about the face, but
this 'was no indication that he was over
trained. He remarked that Dougherty
Â¦would enter the ring weighing 108 pounds
and in shape to give "Kid" McFadden the
hottest battle he ever had In his life.
Oscar Gardner is working like a Trojan
at Croll's Gardens, Alameda. He ex
presses great confidence in his ability to
defeat McGovern and says he will enter
the ring trained to the hour. He has wait
ed for this chance to retrieve his defeat
at the hands of McGovern and he vows
that he will make the most of it.
An account of McGovern and Gard
ner's first battle is interesting at this
time. Just a year ago they .battled before
the Broadway Athletic Club of New
York. Following is an excerpt from a de
scription of the contest by an Eastern
writer:
' Their First Fight.
The first round . opened with a session of
sparring and Terry reached the jaw with his
left straight. In a fierce rally both landed lefts
and rights. Oscar then knocked Terry down
with a left hook on the jaw. Terry was puzzled
when he regained his feet and kept at long
range, blocking Gardner's swings. . When he
had recovered from the punch he started to
cut the pace again, showing wonderful recu
perative powers. They slugged for a full half
minute, both getting to head and jaw with
rights and lefts. In a rally near the ropes
Terry sent Oscar to the boards with a left

round Ritchey had considerably the bet
ter of the in-fighting, but the round ended
with honors even. The third round ended
.slightly in favor of Ritchey, but the gorg
found him on the ropes' from a left to the
jaw. In the fifth Yanger rushed himself
to the floor and Ritchey planted a strong
left to his jaw when he came up. In the
eighth Ritchey floored Yanger with a ter
rible left jolt to the jaw, but the Chica
goan was up immediately, and rushed
Kitcney, who fell to his knees. Both were
on the ropes when the gong- rang-
Ritchey opened the twelfth with a rush,
but v.as fought to the ropes by Yanger.
1 anger put .Ritchey down with straight
lefts to the face and stomach. Ritchey
was slightly groggy and the round was
all in Yanger's favor. Both men slipped
to the floor in rushes during the four
teenth round, but neither was hurt. After

ATIETLETES WILL WRESTLE
BETORE THE FAIR SEX
Olympic Club Tournament Promises
' to Be an Exciting and Inter
esting One.
Â¦ All' is 1n readiness for the wrestling
tournament which is to be held In ' the
gymnasium of the Olympic Club to-mor
row night in honor of the fair sex. The
athletes who' are entered are trained to
the hour and eager for the signal to dis
play their prowess on the mat. John A.
Hammersmith, the leader of the club,
under whose direction the contests will
be held, guarantees that the evenings
entertainment will surpass any ever giv
en for the edification of the ladies.
Credit is due George S. Miehling, wrest
ling instructor of the club, for the splen
did development of the contestants in this
great sport. For the past year he has
labored on the mat with the young ath
letes and taught them all the tricks of
the game. The members who are to take
part in the tournament have attained
high development in wrestling. They are
to wrestle six-minute bouts, and as vic
tory will depend on speed and skill the
spectators will have an opportunity of
seeing some fast and clever work.
George W. Braun is looked upon as a
sure winner in. the 135-pound class. Ex
perts say he is the best wrestler at his
weight ever developed in the Olympic
Club. W. R. McCullough has improved
greatly since the last tournament and is
certain to give the heavyweights a hard
tussle. Never before has there been so
many Heavyweight wrestlers in an Olym
pic Club tournament. There are three
who weigh more than 200 pounds each. H.

BY Fl-E. MUXHOIXAND.
NOT so many days, ago Barney
Schreiber purchased the Himyar
mare Jennie for $400, Intending to
install her in the harem at
"Woodlands Farm, Missouri. Pos
sibly thinking she might earn railroad
fare. Trainer Felix Carr dropped her in
-Ihe six furlongr sprint, fourth on the card
&t Tanforan yesterday, for which Her
Â¦Inoso reigned a 9 to 10 chance. Meehanus,
It was figured, might slip in first, but
,against Jennie, even with Dominick in
.the saddle, 30 to 1 went begging. Ever
;Â©n the alert at the barrier, Dominick got
; Kls mount away in the lead, and with
'Hermoso not diseased with speed, showed
the way throughout, winning by half a
length from Doublet, a 20 to 1 shot. Her
moso ran third. Billy Cahill iried a new
*f angled boot on Rinaldo, but the bla-zed
tared horse didn't relish it, endeavoring
To carry both boot and boy over the out
>ide fence, and ruining all chances Mee
Â¦fianus may have had as well.
; This was only one of the mishaps favor
ites met with. lnnocencia, , El Karn,
Malay and Companion fell in for exten
sive backing and all pulled up very dusty
looking without the purse. Nash Turner
was the only rider to pilot two winners.
Â¦Dominick having an off day.
Â¦'Â¦"Naturally -enough El Karn, the mount
of Dominick, was installed favorite for
the five furlong scramble that opened the
, lacing. Uf the gelding had any speed it
was left in the stable. Eidred, ridden by
Conley, led into the stretch, when Nash
Turner, on Bill Young, a warm tip, as
sumed the front position, beating out
Cambaceres a head. The latter was much
the best, coming from far in the rear.
Na?b Turner, on Elmwood Farm's Tiger
<co!t The Giver, beat the favorite lnno
cencia a head for- the two-year-old dash
at four furlongs. The winner carried
much wise support at odds of 4 and 5 to
1, and pot up just in time under hard rid
ing. Murcia, a smart filly from Ab.
Stemler's stable, played on some fast
Â¦workouts, worked her way from, back in
the bunch, finishing third.
Beaten on the Saturday previous, when
backed off the boards, Parader came
Â¦through in the seven furlong selling af
fair;- downing a cheap assortment. The
.big gelding went to the post favorite over
â¢ Midian and at the wire won easily. Alex
ander finished third on Rainier, a 12 to 1
outsider.
- Making his reappearance after a long
Season on the shelf, Gotobed, with "Jess"
Conley up, came home an easy winner of
the mile and a sixteenth run Prejudice
and Malay enjoyed the call, it being 5 to
2 and take your pick. The t*o choices
raced themselves to a standstill, and at
the close Gotobed scored in a big gallop
at odds of 4 to 1. Malay lasted just long
enough to take the place from Dr. Ber
*iays. . . . .
An ordinary set of platers lined up in
Ihe final five furlong scramble. Compan
ion ruled favorite, but quit, and Quibo
beat Aphrodis out in a drive. The win
ner was a 6 to 1 chance.

Dominick will probably leave for Chi

The fame of Corrigan has reached, the

KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 22.â Mrs.
Carrie Nation's visit- to Kansas City _ two
Sundays ago and her arrest has resulted
in a â¢ strong movement against the Sun
day saloon that may end in bringing to
a definite issue . the fight between the
Kansas joint-smasher and the police. Â«. ,
Yesterday several local ministers
preached strong sermons denouncing the
police for making the arrest and Police
Judge McAuley for fining Mrs- Nation for
no other reason than that she gathered
a crowd about her by denouncing a sa
loon-keeper for exhibiting nude pictures
in his place.
To-day the Ministers' Alliance, at the
regular weekly meeting, drafted a peti
tion to the Mayor and Board of Police
Commissioners, praying that they enforce
the State law against Sunday opening,
and a strenuous effort is to be made by
church people generally to aid the move
ment. Â¦ â¢'
Judge McAuley, when he fined Mrs. Na
tion 1500, threatened Â¦ her with arrest
should she return to the city, and Chief
of Police Hayes emphasized the court's
warning. Notwithstanding this Mrs. Na
tion has agreed to lecture here before the
Union -Mission next Friday night and the
church people are said to have planned
to bring the matter to an issue with the
Police Department by meeting her at the
depot with a brass band and escorting
her about town.

The board of directors of the Manufac
turers' and Producers* Association met
yesterday afternoon for the purpose of
discussing the propriety of making repre
sentations to the Navy Department in re
gard to having ships of the United States
navy stationed in Pacific waters repaire<l
at this port. I By unanimous vote the sec
retary was directed to send the following
letter to Secretary of the Navy Long:-,
The board of directors of this association,
having had under consideration the subject of
future repairs to. ships of the United States
navy, now stationed and hereafter to be em
ployed in the Philippine Islands, in Asiatic
waters and generally in the Pacific Ocean, de
sires to indorse the representations which have
been made to your department by the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce under date at
April 16 Ia3t, and to most earnestly express
to you the sentiment of this association and of
this State generally that, owing to the nearness
of Pacific Coast ports to the Orient and for the
other reasons stated, it la most appropriate and
also in the Interests of economy that repairs
to such' ships should be made at such ports,
so far as compatible with the requirements of
the service, instead of sending such ships to
Atlantic ports for that purpose.
. The large navy yard at Mare Island, as well
as- the other existing facilities of this port,
enable vessels of all classes to be repaired here
expeditiously and with economy, as has been
demonstrated heretofore, -and It Is the spirit of
our local merchants and manufacturers, if
offered sufficient encouragement, to remain
equipped and to hold themselves In readiness to
supply material, etc., required In, such repairs
on short notice.

MAY BE REPAIRED HERE

Other witnesses examined were Harold
S. Adams. George H. Martin. R. C. Pier
son, Adolph Morris. S. J. Simpson, . David
Martin, George D. Jones, Dr. Edwin Bun
nell and Detective O'Dea. This closed the
case for the prosecution, and the defense
will be heard this, morning. Moody has
also I another charge of attempted mur
der against him for shooting Adams,
which will be tried after the conclusion
of the present case.
The trial of Albert Moody^formerly a
jockey, on a charge of assault to murder,
was commenced before a jury in Judge
Cock's court yesterday morning. Assist
ant District Attorney Deuprey conducted
the prosecution and the defendant was
represented by Senator Porter Ashe.
On the morning of July 4 last, while
Mrs. .Lulu St. D. Roylance was leaving
the. Winchester House, where her hus
band was rooming, she met Moody, who
had apparently been waiting for her. Bhe
was accompanied by Harold S. Adams,
a friend. Moody fired three shots at Mrs.
Roylance, each taking effect. He also
shot â¢ and wounded Adams. The woman
made a statement. In which she declared
that Mocdy had shot her. Tiiey had been
intimate in their relations for some time,
and it was the knowledge that she in
tended to return to her husband that
caused Moody to attempt to kill her.
Since the shooting Mrs. Roylance has
obtained a divorce from her husband,
Leon St. Denis Roylance, * and has en
deavored to stop the District Attorney
and Judge Cook from proceeding with
the case against Moody. While testify
ing yesterday she denied all knowledge
ot the statement made by her and ad
mitted the intimate relations -that had
existed between her and the defendant.

Green for threatening Shmidt with a beer

out of the buggy, but was uninjured. He
went away, promising to send a glazier
to repair the damage, and drove to his
stable. The glazier came and saw the
ruins, but declined to make good the
damage until he saw the coin. McCarthy
did not hSve it with him and could not
get it, and finally declined to pay for it
any way. So the window remains un
glazed.
McCarthy, who has handled all kinds of
horses during his lifetime, declares that
his business has been ruined by the in
troduction of the automobile. The horse
that he was driving is an intelligent ani
mal and just how he lost control of it,
as a horseman, he does not know. The
horse was the worst injured party In the
transaction. The animal was taken to
Mlchelson's stables, 814 Geary street,
and treated by a veterinary surgeon.
McCarthy, with a choice vocabulary of
expletives, declared it was the first time
he had ever missed the pole. !

IN THE CITT LIMITS
Coroner's Deputies Wander About tho
Dismal Woods With a Suicide's
Body.
It sounds like a surprise when the state
ment is made that any adult of sound
mind and well acquainted with the city
should get lost within its limits, yet that
is what happened yesterday morning to
Deputy Coroner Meehan and Morgue Mes
senger Thomas Smith.
They left the i Morgue at midnight of
Sunday to -get the dead body of Frederick
"Weidenhoefer, which had been found in
the gum and cypress forest on the Spring
Valley reserve, three and a half miles
west of the Ingleside Road House and one
mile north of the old Ocean House Road.
They were met at the Ingleside House by
Police Patrolman King, who piloted them
to the spot where the dead body lay. On
coming back through the dense woods the
party lost its way and wandered about in
the darkness for two hours before Police
man King struck the trail that led into
civilization. Meehan and Smith, hungry,
thirsty and half frozen, arrived at the
Morgue with their grewsome load at 7:30
o'clock in the morning, having been seven
hours and a half on the trip, and all of
that period within the city limits.
The body of the dead man was identified
"Wants Match With. McGovern.
Frank Carrils, manager of Herrera, the
Eakersfield featherweight who handily
defeated Toby Irwin a week ago, claims
he is willing to post a certified check for
$1000 with The Call to bind a match be
tween his protege and Terry McGovern.
Carrils also says he will make a side bet
as high as $5000 that Herrera can defeat
the Brooklyn whirlwind. He has dele
gated Judd Gibbs, the local fight pro
moter, to make the match. Gibbs says
that the residents of Bakersfleld look
upon Herrera as a wonder, and are will
ing to wager thousands of dollars on him
whenever he fights.
To end the discussion fully 200 members
rose and forced their way out of the hall
and several of the orators must have
gone out with them, for after their de
parture the resolution went through
speedily.
A committee consisting of Messrs.
Aubertin, Selma and Jacobs was appoint
ed to meet with a committee from the
bosses' organization to-night and inform
the members that their prices met with
the approval of the journeymen.
The resolution indorsing these prices
was adopted only after nearly every one
of the 900 members present had, indulged
in oratorical flights. Several times dur
ing the evening points of order were
raised, which sank Into oblivion - during
the debate that followed and were
brought .to the attention of the chair an
hour after the subject in dispute had been
disposed of.
Vice President "Wray, the "lawyer bar
ber," and J. J. Calish, the /'politician
barber," tilted occasionally on knotty
points In parliamentary law and delayed
the â¢ passage of the resolution adopting
the bosses' prices, until the barbers pres
ent began to think of the man who wants
a shave before catching an early morning
boat.
Shaving, every day In the week, 15. cents;
balrcutting, 25 cents; singeing, 25 cents; sham
pooing:, 25 cents, and sea foam, 10 cents.
The boss barbers submitted a schedule
of prices, which was indorsed after a
stormy debate by the Journeymen. Tho
prices that will prevail in the future are
as follows: .

who takes them all to the barbers Satur

has had that 10-cent raise tacked onto
the price of trimming her darling's locks
and must in the future pay a quarter for
the attention. The barbers contend that
the youngsters' heads are as large as
their papa's and in most cases have a
heavier covering.
The fear engendered in the minds of
those who patronize the barbers that they,
would have to pay a quarter to have their
beards removed was allayed at the meet
of the Barbers' Union last night. The
journeymen decided that/ to wait fifteen
or twenty minutes to hear a whlte-coateu
tonsorlalist cry "next" was worth a lit
tle something and decided that 15 cents
should be the standard price.

McCarthy saved his gold medals and his
white hat, and is ready for another
brush with anything that comes along.
BAN MCCARTHY, popularly
known at "White .Hat McCar
thy." had an excitlns adventure
on Geary street early yesterday
morning. He drove his horse
through the windows of the tailor shop
of A. H. Eehm, at 409 Geary street, and
came near Bearing: into fits the women
employed therein. Tailor Behm was han
dling the "goose" when he saw the horse
coming through the window. He sounded
the alarm, and Miss B. Haundrop, who
was sitting in front of the Â¦window, and
her mother, who was a flew feet away,
barely escaped being cut by the flying
glass.
From just what direction McCarthy
came Is not definitely known. Some say
that he came down from Post street along
Mason, and that the horse, smelling a
square meal In the stable at 814 Geary
street, made a dash in that direction. Mc-
Carthy attempted to guide the frightened
animal against a telegraph pole, but
missed the mark and crashed through the
windows of the tailor shop. No one was
injured except the horse, although several
persons had narrow escanes.
The animal plunged clean through the
window, breaking sash and glass. He was

CHANCE TO SMILE.
Only a short time ago The Call directed attention
to a report. that the great Metropolitan Opdfa-house
in New York, the most sumptuous home of grand
opera in this country, was about to pass into the hands
of a company that would use it for vaudeville enter
tainments at popular prices. That was but one of the
many signs of the time. All over the United States
the same tendency is observable. Commenting upon
the situation in Boston "the Transcript says: "Actor
after, actor, singer after singer, musician after musi-
The change has been shown by the rapidly increas
ing'scope and prestige of the vaudeville in the field
of dramatic art. The time is not very far back in the
psst.when a vaudeville Was hardly recognized as a'
genuine theater. It occupied a vague ground some
where between Shakespeare and a one-ring circus.
It was a stage where clowns, acrobats, trick dogs and
comic singers were combined to give a variety enter
tainment for people who had no other desire than to
laugh. During the last few years a remarkable devel
opment has taken place. The vaudeville has grown
at the expense of the legitimate drama and of opera,
until to-day some of the foremost actors and singers
of the world do not hesitate to accept. vaudeville en
gagements. With the improved character of the per
formances there has come an improved audience. Not
long ago the vaudeville was something that "society"
did not recognize. At present in several of the larger
cities of the country a y au deville audience includes
many of the most fastidious of theater-goers.
WHILE the public has been discussing the "ele
vation of the stage," and suggestions have been
made again and again of the desirability of es
tablishing an endowed theater for the production of
"legitimate drama," a change has been going on in
the* theatrical world which, if not checked or diverted
from its present course, will leave us in a compara
tively few years with hardly any old-school stage to
be elevated or any legitimate drama to be endowed.
THE VAUDEVILLE STAGE.
We have desired to see this issue closed "as a part
of home; politics, since'its reopening at any time in
the future will be costly in many ways. It is of such
supreme importance as to warrant an amendment of
the constitution, if necessary, to quiet forever any
agitation for statehood.
Therefore, our sovereignty in the Philippines is not
interpreted by us to mean there what it means at home,
and among and over ourselves. A careful reading of
the Filipino general's language clearly discloses that
it contains the germs of future trouble, since it leaves
open to him,.or to any others, the way to interpret
denial of statehood, citizenship and the liberties they
promise as a violation of the promises to which he so
vaguely refers. . v
We believe that statehood has at no time been con
templated, either by Congress or the administration.
Indeed, it is not left at all doubtful, for the administra
tion in its answer to the several suits now before the
Supreme Court has distinctly antagonized the theory
that the constitution follows the flag, and has dis
claimed the belief that Porto Rico and the Philippines
are potential states.
It announces a surrender to irresistible force and
the belief that under '.'the sovereign banner of Lhe
United States the Filipino people will attain all those
promised liberties they are beginning toÂ» enjoy." Until
the' American, and. Filipino people have a common
understanding of those promised liberties it is im
possible to predict permanent results and lasting
peace. We may not be mistaken in saying that it is
not trie intention ofthe American people to admit the
islands as states and their people as equal citizens!
The racial and commercial problems which would
generate in such a policy are too grave for it. to be
feasible. If Aguinaldo intend to hold out to his coun
trymen that statehood and full citizenship are near or
remote his manifesto is full of future mischief and
c.oes not deserve to be taken at high value.
IT may well be that the importance of Aguinaldo's
proclamation remains to be demonstrated. Its best
effects may not be its immediate and present influ
ence. It lacks that spontaneity and frankness which
are based only on the ceitain and absolute.
AGUINALDO'S MANIFESTO.

Double Judicial Systems.
Again the Dutch " have given evidence
of . great tact in Â¦ not following the same
policy in all districts, awaiting their time
and only imposing their authority , when
and where crcumstances have been most
favorable. And it is thus that the great
er part of Java and Madura, in spite of
the dual administration, is under the ab
solute of the Dutch, although
some districts enjoy a certain amount of
independence. In the other possessions,
out- of Java and Madurk, Â¦ the - independ
ence of the native . princes is still far
greater and the dominion Â¦ of the Dutch
but nominal. Â¦
From the time of the English rule the
native princes were styled ""regents"and
the Dutch Governors of the various prov
inces "residents." The princes held their
power by virtue of letters patent from
the sovereign of the Netherlands and be
came in reality . functionaries of the sov
ereign. Though the princes were divested
of their own sovereignty by one fell blow,
the .Dutch were wise enough to respect
scrupulously all their traditions, manners,
laws, customs and usages in all walks of
life. Their titles, marks of. distinction,
sumptuous : manners of living, the ..pomp
and ceremony, and etiquette, of the va
rious courts have always been carefully
preserved and zealously protected, but at
the same time in- each province and by
the side of each regent there is a Dutch
Deputy Governor. This latter function
ary keeps himself quite in the dark and
appears modest and . unassuming, . yet he
is the ruling power and, in order to sat
isfy the native population, he is : known
as the "elder brother" of the prince, for
according to Mohammedan law. . prevalent
in the Dutch East Indies, the elder broth
er has authority over the younger.
Position of Native Princes.
The Governor General, as representative
of the crown, is practically an absolute
monarch. It is auite evident that such
powers, reaching over a population of 35,
000,000, necessitates the creation of a great
corps of functionaries to assist in the ad
ministration. Beyond this centralized
Government, which is- purely Duch and
has its headquarters at Batavia, the capi
tal of the Dutch East Indies, we find
the administration following immediately
on its heels. This is by far the most
interesting feature of the Dutch colonial
system, adopted as far back as the old
days of the Dutch East India Company,
which,' like its successors, gave predomi
nance in all colonial matters to those af
fairs that directly interested the commer
cial and financial side of their enterprise.
The colonial government is divided into
two departments â namely, the home, gov
ernment and the local government; the
latter being subdivided into the European
and native administrations. At home the
supreme colonial power is vested in the
sovereign, at the present moment Queen
Wllhelmlna, but the political responsi
bility of her acts, as iar as colonial mat
ters are concerned, is vested in the Min
ister of the Colonies, the present Minister
being J. T. Cremer, a comparatively
young man and a very able one. All royal
decrees relating to the colonies must be
countersigned by the Minister of the Colo
nies, who is, by. virtue of his responsibil
ity, at liberty to refuse his signature. It
is the Minister, who is responsible to the
States General as well as to the sovereign,
and the latter's administrative and execu
tive power is wholly transferred to the
Governor General of the Dutch East
Indies, to whom all colonial subjects owe
the same respect and obedience as to their
sovereign. This high official is' appointed
by the sovereign upon the recommenda
tion of the cabinet, but the sovereign re
serves the right of calling upon him to re
sign when he thinks such a step neces
sary. .
fact, throughout the Dutch East Indies,
two distinct administrations, the one Eu
ropean with the master hanQ, the other
composed of native princes and based on
the native feudalism. The natives being
thus in contact only with the second ad
ministrative power believe they are sub
ject only to their natural masters, never
realizing for a moment that their own
princes .are but humble subjects of .the
sovereign of the Netherlands. It is, there
fore, in the above dual system that we
'find the true source of the colonial suc
cess of the- Dutch.
It is believed that Sumatra was once the

The Hollanders have not yet succeeded
in conquering the natives of Sumatra, and
the sovereignty of Tha Netherlands over
that Island is only nominal. Sumatra is
really a vast part of the Dutch East In
dian possessions and thirteen times larger
than Holland. The independent popula
tions in the northern districts have re
fused to cede their right to self-govern
ment. The Netherlands Government, in
the frequent conflicts following the year
1873, has learned this to its cost and as a
consequence the remarkable Dutch sys
tem of colonization has never had a fair
trial throughout the island. The Achinese
still remain defiant, but when once con
quered, it Is to be expected that the Dutch
will apply their favorite schemes here as
they have done with such good results in
Java and Madura.
Conditions in Sumatra.
At the present time the greater part of
the trade of Java and Madura is carried
on directly with Holland, but since the
greater commercial liberty established in
1872 the trade with Great Britain has
taken large proportions. England buys
the raw sugar, which she â¢ exchanges for
cotton goods and hardware, while the
United States, France and China have an
important trade with the East Indian
islands. In 1S99 the customs receipts of
Java and Madura were $4,193,330. From the
sale of coffee, salt, sugar, bark and tin
the Government realized in 1900 nearly $50,
000,000, while the expenditures were about
5600,000 more. In 18SS the exports, in addi
tion to the above mentioned items, includ
ing tobacco, indigo, gums and spices, for
Java and Madura alone amounted to $30,
750,000, while the imports amounted to
about $75,000,000.
All this tropical wealth is protected by
an army of 34,000 men, of whom 18,000 are
Europeans, commanded by a lieutenant
general, who ls,commancler-in-chlef of the
colonial forces i and Minister of "War for
the Colonies, and by a navy of eighteen
war .vessels manned by 2225 meh, all of
whom belong to the mother country. Be
sides these war vessels there is a small
fleet of state corvettes that do police duty
along the coasts.
And now we come to the practical part
of this great colonial work of the hardy
little Dutch nationâ the trade of Java,
the source of the greatest riches that
have been amassed In Holland.
The Commerce of the Indies.

From what is now occurring in the older States
California ought to learn a profitable lesson. It is
an easy and an agreeable thing to say that the disas
ters are only added proofs of the superiority of our
climate, and to rejoice that we do not have that kind
of incoming of April and May. There is, however,
something more in th- problem than climate. As
yet our hills and mountiins retain their forests and our
streams have not become wholly torrential. The
waste of forests is. however, going on upon the Pacific
Coast with an alarming rapidity. A few more decades
without adequate protection for our woods and the
story of April and May on this coast will not be unlike
that now coming from the banks of the Ohio.
These disastrous floods over the whole reach of the
well settled parts of the United States are not due
wholly to the weather. To a large extent they are
the outcome of man's folly. All through those States,
from Maine to Ohio, men have cut away or burned
or in other ways wasted the forests that once
slocd upon the hillsides and upon the mountains. In
times past the forests served as natural reservoirs of
the water released by melting snows or the falling
spring rains. Now that they have been destroyed the
Maters rush down the channels of the streams in tor
rential wildncss. floods follow and new losses to farm
rnd to factory are added to the direct losses caused
by the waste of the woods.
Now, as we approach the beginning of May, come
reports of even wilder snd wider floods and more
extensive losses from a!l the region extending from
Western Pennsylvania lo Western Ohio. The streams
rre running in roaring torrents down from the moun
tains and the hills and even such large rivers as the
Ohio are not able to carry off the water rapidly
enough to prevent disaster. In fact, the Ohio is at
iSood height. The swollen and still swelling waters
*re pressing against the tops of the levees, and so nenr
rrd imminent is the danger that the passing of steam-'
boats threatens to ad-1 just the final pressure of force
reeded to send the waves, over the banks. The watch
ful residents along the river perceive the danger, and
we learn from the dispatches that. in their desperation
they have several times fired upon passing steamers
as a warning to them not to come near the shore.
AT the beginning of April reports came from
New England of storms of wind and rain ex
tending from Maine to Connecticut. All the
streams and rivers rose to flood height; many bridges
were carried away. In several of the manufacturing
towns the mills were flooded and work stopped for
a number of days. The damage was not great in any
one locality, but in the aggregate it amounted to a
vast sum, and not a fev lives were lost, so that the
arrival of spring in that section of the Union was not
an occasion for festivity.

MINERAL ON SCHOOL LANDâSub
scriber, Cal. This correspondent writes:
"A man holds a piece of State school land
on which 20 per cent has been paid and
the deed is recorded. A man, not the one
holding the deed, flnd3 gold-bearing quartz
on the land. Can he take up a claim upon
it?" The rule Is settled that mineral lands
are exempt from the grants of school
lands to the State. Consequently If min
erals should be embraced in any of the
school lands the title does not pass to the
State (Llndley on Mines, 136. A standard
work on mines). In pursuance of this rule
It was held In Mining Company vs. Con
solidated Mining Company, 102 U. S., 167,
where there was a controversy, one claim
ing under a patent of school land from the
State and one claiming the same property
under the mining laws of the United
States, that the title of the State claimant
must yield, as the mineral portion never
vested in the State. This case was fol
lowed In Hermocilla vs. Hubbell, 89 Cal..
5. It would seem from this that a party
can take up a mineral claim under the
laws of the United States on school lands,
even though the land has been sold by the
State.

The decisions have occasioned a good deal of at
tention in the Eastern ' States, where there are living
a large number of people who have obtained divorces
in States other than those in which they had a matri
monial domicile. The effect will, of course, be to put
a check upon that method of getting divorce, and
accordingly that particular problem may be said to
have been settled. â¢ .
In the third case both the wife and the husband
lived in Kentucky for a time, but the wife left the
home and went to New York to" reside. The husband
sought and obtained a divorce in Kentucky. The
Supreme Court held that to be a valid divorce, be
cause the proceedings were taken in a State where
both, parties had a matrimonial domicile up to the
period of desertion.
According to the reports from Washington the Su
preme Court in deciding the cases declared "that
decrees of divorce granted anywhere except in the
matrimonial domicile oÂ£Â»the parties concerned are not
entitled to faith and credit in the courts of any jurisdic
tion other than that in which the dissolution of the
marriage bond was obtained." By the phrase "matr
rimonial domicile" i? meant a place of residence where
the parties to an action in divorce have lived together
as husband and wife and with the intention to make
the same their home. A domicile acquired in a new
jurisdiction by either husband or wife alone will not
satisfy the conditions required to validate a divorce
outside of that jurisdiction. .
In two of the casesâ cne from New York aifd one
from New Jersey â the question involved the validity,
of divorces granted in Dakota when only one of the
parties to the divorce was a resident of that State.
It appears that in one case the husband and in the
other the wife left home and went to Dakota, where,
after living long' enough to attain a legal residence, a
divorce was obtained. On returning to their former
homes the parties found that the courts of New York
and New Jersey would not recognize ' the Dakota
divorce, and accordingly an appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court of the United States on tlje ground
that the action of the State tribunals was unconstitu
tional, inasmuch as they refused to accept properly
authenticated decrees of the courts of other States
as legal evidence of divorcement. ..
'It now appears thai something may be accomplished
in the way of bringing, order put of chaos by the
Supreme Court of the United States. That tribunal
has recently given decisions in three divorce cases
which not only serve to settle some disputed points
growing out of the varying laws of the different States,
but may prove to be precedents out of which will
develop further decisions so far reaching in their effect
as to virtually provide something' like uniformity of
divorce and marriage in all the States.
THE PROBLEM. OF DIVORCE.
|â J OR a long time p?st there has been an agitation
J for the establishment of something like uniform
laws governing marriage and divorce throughout
the United States. The efforts of the reformers have
been to induce one State after another to enact such
laws in accord with a system agreed upon. From the
very nature of things their efforts have been fruitless
of any result further than that of making known the
evils of the present condition of affairs, and the out
look of the (movement, for reform has never been
bright enough to encourage practical legislators to de
vote much of their time and energy to the cause. .
natives, justice is dispensed according to
their own institutions, customs and relig
ious obligations in so far as these har
monize with the acknowledged universal
principles of justice. Discretion is given
to the Judge to decide what religion . or
custom shall arovern each particular case
and when we Take into consideration how
vast are' the eastern possessions of the
little Dutch kingdom, how great are the
varieties of race, of local customs, of re
ligious and social obligations, some Idea
can be formed of the extent of this dis
cretionary power. In 1873 the European
criminal code was applied to all the in
habitants of the Dutch possessions, with
the onlr difference that whereas the Eu
ropeans are punished by imprisonment the
natives are punished by forced labor with
or without chains. The system of tri
bunals and of court precedure of Euro
peans is similar in all its decrees to the
courts of Holland.
In the vital question of education, the
rock-foundation of the future, the Dutch
have put their principles of colonization
severely.to the test. In this, as in all other
matters, their determination not to inter
fere with the traditions of the natives has
been the guiding rule, and so the scnoois
are conducted in the native tongue. "One
of the most tactful measures," says an
authority on the subject, "employed by
the Dutch to appease the natives and ease
the burden of Dutch dominion, which the
Dutch ever seek to conceal, is the use of
the native languages in all their relations
and Intercourse with the natives."
Nearly all colonies founded by the great
nations, both in modern as well as in an
cient times, the conquering nation has
forced its language upon the conquered
people, but the Dutch' have found it far
more practical, far more to their advant
age, to learn the languages of the various
races they govern. As an example of this
it may be mentioned that Queen Wllhelm-
Ina is now studying Javanese with great
assiduity. j

any way with the native beliefs. Moham

X.â THE DUTCH EAST INDIES.
- In the annals of successful colonization
the small Dutch nation ranks next to
Great Britain. With a population scarcely
larger than that of the city of London she
has planted her standard in a vast region
sixty-five times greater than that of her
own little land of dikes and windmills and
has maintained her sovereignty over 35,
000,000 people en the other side of the
globe. Her tatik has been so. great, so
fraught with difficulties that Dutch colo
nization has become a veritable science.
These colonies have always been admin
istered as conquered possessions, their
government has been autocratic and the
inhabitants have never had a voice In the
form or manner of government to which
they are subjected. Such is the real rela
tionship between theDutch colonizers and
those over whom they rule, 'but the secret
of this policy, so cunning on the part of
the Dutch, consists in covering, over this
unpleasant truth so successfully that the
natives believe themselves subject only to
their natural chiefs, to their own princes
and their national feudalism. In brief, the
Dutch ruler hides the mailed fist beneath
a silken glove by abstaining from all at
tempt at presolytism, moral or religious,
and by paying a scrupulous respect to the
customs and rites of the natives. The sys
tem of rule is really one of absolute sub
jection, in which the power at home im
poses upon the colonies, without Consult
ing them, whatever legislation it thinks
the most in its own interest, while the
colonies themselves are represented neith
er in Parliament nor in the Government
councils.
A Dual System of Government.

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
In estimating the economy of a municipal water
supply, the expense of which has to be borne by all
the taxpayers, it is not habitual with the advocates of
such policy to consider all the items, or to remember
that the entire cost must be divided between all tax
payers and added to the rate paid for the water which
each consumes and pays for. A municipal plant pays
no taxes, therefore the share which it should bear has
to be borne by other property, and is added to the
ratepayer's burdens. To put a municipal plant in
condition for comparison with one in private or cor
porate ownership, it must be charged with the taxes
which the private plant would pay, and with interest
on' the cost of the plant. It must also be made equal
to the private plant by using the same filtering and
other devices to make the water safe and potable.
AsvAve have shown in the case of Chicago, Washing
ton, Philadelphia, New York and Boston the quality
of the supply is bad and is not bettered by the methods
which public authority compels the private plants to
use. If those methods are adopted in a public supply
their cost and the interest thereori must be paid by
the people, either in an increased price for the water
or in taxation. When all these elements are taken into
the calculation a comparison of cost between the two
methods of supply can be made and not before.
It is probable that an expert inquiry made into the
water administration of Chicago, Philadelphia and
Boston .will expose a similar deficiency .in, revenues^,
and a like offset of .cost to the taxpayer, to balance
apparent economy to the. same taxpayer. as a water
consumer. .
What Mill called "the coarse and careless hand of
government," forced into the transaction of such es
sentially business affairs as public service industries,
is too apt to present a sheet with the balance on the
wrong side.
When this report was submitted-the Merchants' As
sociation passed the following resolution of indorse
ment: "Resolved, That the report showing discrepan
cies in the city revenues, dated November 21, 1900,
â¢^ade *o this board by Mr/ de Berard by direction of
President King, be accepted and at once made public."
In his conclusion the expert, says: "I have cited the
facts as set" forth as evidence that the present system
of public records and reports in use in this city is
insufficient, because it does not record or report the
details of this city's business in such form as to pro
tect the taxpayers against waste and corruption. The
admission of the Commissioner of Water Supply is that
the system under which the business of his department
is carried on does not inform him what the proper
water revenues of the city should be, and that he can
not, therefore, know whether the meter service of
Manhattan should yield $2,500,000 or $5,000,000 per
year. It is obvious that the task of fully collecting the
city's revenue is a difficult one when the official
charged with that duty does not know how much is
due and who owes it."
Taking the metered water as the basis of his investi
gation the expert made an exhaustive inquiry. He
found the water administration and the books and
records in a hopeless condition of confusion, out of
which it was scarcely possible to ascertain the loss to
the taxpayers from a , careless system of collection.
He found that the revenue from metered water should
have been $11,246,162, but that the collections made
and arrearages reported by the Water Registrar
amounted to only $7,10.3.372, leaving a loss to the tax
payers of $4,142,700. t
He found that since 1891 no report of the metered
water and collections has been made at all, and that
the city loses one-third of the amount which it should
collect for such water.
Supervisor Reed, in his interesting communication
on that subject, quotes the statistics of the Merchants'
Association of New York, and shows that municipal
water is cheaper per family than corporate water sup
ply by an average of two and a half cents per day per
family. As the argument of economy to the consumer
is justly potent it becomes necessary to examine the
methods of administration and collection. A munici
pal supply is at the cost of all the taxpayers, as a cor
porate supply is at the cost of all the stockholders of
the corporation. If the corporation is lax in its ad
ministration and its collections the amount apparently
saved by the ratepayers is a loss to the stockholders.
Also, if municipal ownership is careless in administra
tion and collection from the consumers, the loss falls
upon the taxpayers, and in their case reduces the ap
parent saving of two and a half cents per day per
family. If the taxpaying head of a family save two
and a half cents per day on his water bill, and pay out
that amount or any part of it in taxes necessary to pay
the cost of the water supply," the loss in taxes becomes
a part of his water bill. The same Merchants' Asso
ciation quoted by Supervisor Reed instituted an expert
inquiry into the loss to the taxpayers of New York
due to defective administration of the municipal water
supply.
WHEN discussing such an interesting question
as the municipal ownership of public service in
dustries it is necessary to argue from the full
data at hand.

PERSONAL MENTION.
It is too early to undertake to forecast what will
he the result of the new development, or the effect
which' the change will have upon our acting and our
music. It is evident, however, that the United States
is building up a new form of. theatrical entertainment.
It will doubtless continue to bear the old' name of
vaudeville,' but it will_ be something widely different
from what that name signifies in Europe. It is going
to include the highest acting and the best of music,
for American audiences will demand the best; and in
the end the development may prove to be something
the nation may be proud to point to as its achievement
in the line of theatrical art/
cian, has renounced his conventional dignity as a
'legitimate' performer, and has consented to serve the
whims and caprices of vaudeville patrons. Ingoing
so the artists have all btiilded' better than they knew,
for the circle of variety theater-goers has been grad
ually widened under their influence^ until it practically
includes all to whom the footlights make their ap
peal." .

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
MANY vessels of the coasting fleet
are making long passages and
it is feared that some of them
may have run short of provi
sions if nothing worse has nap
pened. One vessel is almost given up for
lost and the owners would be glad to hear
from a number of others.
The old barkentine Monitor is now out
thirty days from Qrays Harbor for San
Francisco and her owners have almost
given up hope of ever seeing her again.
Before leaving San Francisco on her last
voyage the Monitor was put on the ways
and overhauled. At that time an expert
on hulls said to Captain Donnelly, "If you
should meet with any heavy weather for
God's sake handle her easy." "That's all
right," answered the master, "when it
comes on to blow I'll put her to sleep."
The Monitor and schooner Lettitia left
Grays Harbor In company on March 24
last. The Lettitia made the run down the
coast in six days and has been overhauled
and is ready to start back again, while
the Monitor has not been heard irom
since the Lettitia parted company with
her on March 26. Captain Donnelly was
accompanied by his . wife on this la^t
voyage. '
Of the schooner fleet the Bella- is out
twenty days from San Francisco JuJr Sius
law the Mayflower twenty days for Co
quille, the Lizzie Prien is twenty-four
days out for Siuslaw and the Park
ersburg twenty-four days for Coquille,
while the Nettie Sundborg is sixteen days
and the Wing and Wing twenty-one days
out for Siuslaw. As the Coquille River
is only 360 miles and Siuslaw about 500
miles from here the entire fleet should
have been at its destination long ago.
Both places, however, are very hard to
enter. The bars are bad and if there }s
any heavy weather a vessel has to lie
off and wait for a chance to get in. When
they do get in they very frequently have
to wait for weeks for a chance to get out
again. If they have plenty of provisions
the chances are that the fleet is all right.
CITY OF FUEBI^a. IN COMMISSION
Innovated Puget Sound Liner Now
the Pride of the Fleet.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's City of Puebla arrived from Puget
Sound ports yesterday on her maiden trip
since she was overhauled. The Puebla
was sent to Seattle to be repaired. New
boilers were put in, the machinery was
overhauled, bilge-keels to steady the ves
sel were put on and other work done at a
cost of over $100,000. On her trial on the
Sound the Puebla made over eighteen
knots an hour. On the trip down she aver
aged fifteen and a half knots and Captain
Jepeen is of the opinion that she can
easily make sixteen knots an hour on a
continuous run.
Th* State ot California, which took the
Puebla's place on the Sound run, will be
put on the Seattle-Skaguay route so that
she will not be seen in San Francisco
again for some time to come.
News From the Overdues.
It now appears that there was good rea
son for the reinsurance on the British
ship Ardnamurchan. When the news came
that salmon which was supposed to have
been on the vessel had gone ashore on the
Washington coast the underwriter" at
once began covering their risks. The rate
on the vessel went up and down the scale
and when she finally reached port 50 per
cent was the prevailing figure. A cable
received yesterday by the Merchants' Ex
change says that on December 17 last, oft
the Washington coast the Ardnamurchan
was on her beam ends for several hours
and that 5000 cases of salmon had to be
jettisoned in order to save the vessel.
When the news came that the vessel was
safe it was generally supposed that the
salmon washed ashore was not from the
Ardnamurchan. The cable shows that *:he
first impression was the correct one.
The French bark Grande Duchesse Olga,
now out 109 days from Tahiti for EuroDe
and on which 30 per cent reinsurance has
been paid, was spoken on April 11 in lati
tude 39 degrees 12 minutes north, longi
tude 34 degrees 52 minutes west. The Olga
left here with a cargo of wheat and put
into Tahiti dismasted. New spars were
sent out from France and another start
was made.
On the John McDonald, now out 217
days from Baltimore for San Francisco,
85 per cent is being paid and on the Man
chester, 243 days out from New York for
Yokohama, 60 per cent is the ruling
figure.

LIVES AND WAYS
OF WILD ONES
Ernest Seton Thompson
Talks of Animals He
Has Known.
Tells of Old Beasts Made
Famous and Beloved
by His i Books. '
Ernest Seton-Thompson, whose storie3
of wild animals have charmed old and
young, was heard for the first time on
the lecture platform in this city at Met
ropolitan Temple yesterday afternoon.
Delays and complications kept the audi
ence waiting for more than half an hour,
but no one grumbled and all earned thi
compliment "William Greer Harrison paid
to their â¢ patience. Mr. Harrison intro
duced Mr. Seton, for Seton is his name
and Thompson his nom de plume, in a
neat speech," which he strung out* until
the stereopticon had been put into-work
ing order: then the lecturer came for
ward. '
.Mr. Seton-Thompson is a man of- young
appearance with keen observing eyes that
miss nothing and a voice with something
of an accent .'in it. He does not always
speak fluently, but he chooses his words
well and his descriptions of the lives and
habits of 'his friends, the wild 'animals,
are terse and forceful and at times elo
quent. In opening his lecture yesterday
afternoon he said: . '
"1 will speak to-day of the personal side
of one or two of my wild animal friends,
and by personal side I mean their hu
man side. , It is believed by many that
wild animals are nothing more than ma
chines, but we know better. We know
that they think, that they have a mind.
And not only have they a mind and a con
sciousness but a conscience as well, and
they have a sense of humor and of life
and happiness. A dog's idea of happiness
may not be very high; it may not be any
higher than a desire to keep full of beef
steak, but such as it is, it is definite.. That
is what I mean by the personal side Of
wild animals. It is their mind that I am
after."
Characteristics of Fox Tracks.
The lecturer then took up the trail of
a fox, showing pictures of the tracks in
the snow and telling how the actions of
the fox could be guessed by the charac
teristics of the track. Once he stopped
and dug out a garter snake, but he did
not eat it, and farther on he caught a
prairie chicken lying in fancied security
in a drift. All this was shown by -the
tracks of the fox and by the holes in the
snow where the luckless snake and the
prairie chicken were disturbed.
Then he told of the Springfield fox,
which is the subject of one of the stories
in his book, and then he turned to his ex
periences with bears in the Yellowstone
National Park.
In telling of the bears he made frequent
mention of "Little Johnny," the cub or
"Old Grumpy," two well-known charac
ters among the park bears. Among them,
tco, was an immense grizzly that he de
scribed. It was this grizzly that he Aft
erward made famous as "Wab" in one of
his best stories.
He reserved for the last "Lobo," the
gaunt gray old king wolf of New Mex
ico. "Lobo" is told of in his book, but he
amplified the story and made of the
"grand old reprobate" the wild hero he
really was. It was a graphic story, well
and feelingly told, and when the keen,
cruel head of the old cattle thief was
shown upon the screen the audience for
got all but the noble side of the rugged
ranger and applauded him right heartily.
Woes of Some Animals.
Last evening-Mr. Seton-Thompson lec
tured i again, taking as his subject the
name he gave his book, "Wild Animals
I Have Known." He did not adhere to
the text of the bpok, however, although
several of the characters that make those
pages so charming lent their Interest to
his talk last evening. He told again the
woes of little Mollie Cottontail, of Wully
and Bingo, the dogs; of the pacing mus
tang , and of the fox, and to these he
added his experience with antelopes and
deer, a stag hunt and a moose hunt, the
antics of a pet skunk, the voice and ac
tions of a dog on different trails and the
notes of the , birds along the Red River
of Manitoba.
In describing his dog trailing different
animals he wove In the habits of the
coon, the fox, the skunk and the house
hold cat, and he imitated the cries of the
dog as he pursued each of these animals
and how it was that he could tell by the
cries just what the, dog was doing.
Describes a Deer Hunt.
In describing the deer hunt and the
moose mint he imitated the calls of the
animals, their love cries and their chal
lenges, and when he came to the birds
he whistled- and chirped and called like
everything from a chickadee up to the
great white crane. He imitated the
whirr of wings, the calls of the duck, the
song of. the meadowlark and half a dozen
others and the raucous "honk" of the
gray goose flying northward. He con
cluded by describing the killing of a bull
moose after luring him to h}s doom by
imitating his challenges to battle and fin
ally when they failed, by giving the call
of the lovesick cow moose wailing for her
"It took nature ten years to create that
magnificent animal, which hurt no one,"
he said in conclusion, "and in ten minutes
it was laid low and became nothing more
than a heap of butcher's meat."
Mr. Seton-Thompson will lecture again
Saturday afternoon on "Wild Animals ir.
Captivity," " and again Saturday evening
on "Minds of Animals." His afternoon
lecture will be more for the entertain
ment of 'the children, but his evening talk
will be more advanced. The lectures are
being given under the auspices of the
California Club.

Mrs. Madeline Macondray filed suit yes
trrday for divorce from Robert Arthur
Macondray. As cause of action Mrs. Ma
condray alleces cruelty and In her com
plaint cites many specific acts upon the
part of her husband which, she says,
caused her great distress of body and
mind.
By way of introduction to her complaint
Mrs. Macondray states? that she married
her husband August 2S. 1300. Very soon
after their marriage, she continues, the
defendant commenced to treat her cruelly
and continued such conduct up to the
time she was compelled to seek the pro
tection of her mother, who resides at 103
Frederick street.
Mrs. Macondray's charges of cruelty as
pet forth in the complaint are crisp and
brief. She alleges that her husband rep
resented that he was a man of considera
ble means, which he was not: that he
said he had a position in' the Philippines
which would bring him a large income,
which he did run have, and when she ac
tompnnied him to Manila in search of this
phantom she says she was compelled to
leave the islands and start for the United
Rates under humiliating circumstances
and conditions which were extremely mor
tifying to her pride and injurious to her
health. Continuing, Mrs. Macondray says
lipr husband, though "not an habitual
drunkard." is habitually more or less un
der the influence of liquor. When in this
condition he frequently left her for days
at a time, she says, and on returning
would curse and abuse her. much to her
mental distress. When offered employ
inert "by which he could earn an honest
living." Mrs. Macondray says her hus
band refused to accept it, but continued
f n his round of abuse and dissipation un
til she was compelled to seek the pro
tection of her mother. Mrs. W. G. Rich
si rdson. Mrs. Macondray. in conclusion,
prays for a decree of absolute divorce,
ihf right to resume her maiden name and
r.ny further relief which the court may
?cp fit to award her. She waives the right
to an alimony judgment, however, saying
Â¦that her husband has nothing: and hence
a judgment would avail her not.
Suits for divorce were also filed yester
ray by Susan L. Griffin against Joseph
Criflln for desertion. Annie E. Alexander
nsraSnst O. L. Alexander for cruelty,

BARKENTINE MONITOR. BOUND FOR SAN FRANCISCO. AND SIX SCHOOONERS BOUND BOR SIUSLAW AND
COQUILLE RIVERS ARE NOW CONSIDERABLY OVERDUE. GRAVE FEARS ARE FELt/fOR THE SAFETY
OF THE MONITOR AND HER CAPTAIN AND CREW.
The, Twenty-sixth regiment is quartered
in upper Model Camp and is thoroughly
protected from invasion by civilians.
Lieutenant Colonel Dickman is another
officer whose conduct meets with the dis
approval of his men and the remarks
made by the soldiers are not at all com
plimentary to the doughty commanding
officer. , â¢
A peculiarity connected with the return
of the volunteers, who have been arriving
from the Philippines of late, has been the
absence of any complaint against the offi
cers of the regiments. This evidence of
the pleasant relations between j officers
and privates, however, does hot apply to
the Twenty-sixth Infantry, which arrived
here on the Garonne. The soldiers or
this Â¦ regiment discuss the actions of the
officers under whom they have served
without reservation and the charges made
are enough to convince a civilian that
life in the army is not a bit pleasant.
"Poor'food and poor treatment is due to
poor officers," say the men, and every
one who has a complaint to make 13 will
ing to make it as soon as the fear of im
mediate punishment for his ' presumption
is removed â that is after he -receives his
discharge.
The rumored prospective court-martial
of Lieutenant Edwards, who, it is alleged,
left the regiment at Nagasaki rather than
face a board composed of his superior
officers, is freely discussed by the men.
They are not a bit backward in referring
to him as a "stomach robber," which in
the parlance of the soldier, means "an
officer who underfeeds- his men."

MANY CHARGES
The doors of E. O. McCormlck's private
offices were closed and locked yesterday to
the cutside public. The passenger traffic
manager of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, with a few delegates left over from
tlie Transcontinental Passenger Associa
tion meeting that was held in Del Monte
last week, were going over the ground
preparatory to putting in a bid for the
transportation of the naval recruits that
are to be brought out from the East in
July.
At the recent meeting- down in Monterey
last week it was decided by all the roads
that in the future there rhould be no rate
cutting on Government work, or in plain
BnrHrti. that they would stand together
and divide the business. Yesterday the
Santa Fe, Rock Island and Union Pacific,
and in fact nearly all the roads that ope
rate west of the Mississippi River were
represented at the meeting and the busi
ness was sjiMt up.
President Charles M. Hays is at pres
ent in Southern California. He will ar
rive in thi? city to-morrow and his advent
is nmully awaited by quite a few or the
employes of the Southern Pacific. An old
attache of the road said yesterday that
ho had learned that when Hays arrives
ho will make several changes. He will
a!r?o at the same time thoroughly outline
the policy of the road in the future.
Whether 'this information will be given
by an official circular or whether there
will be a tmnquft. at which those who are
to be rewarded or discharged will be let
down easily, remains to be proved.
Manager "Kruttsohnitt is down the road
and will Journey to this city with Hays.
It is said that when he heard of the train
wrecks that are coming fast and thick
on the coast division he packed his dress
f=uit case. and. eailins his stenographer.
Journeyed south to find out where the
trouble lay. Eastern railroad men claim
that the cause of the recent accidents is
the locomotives that are at present on
the road. They say the engines are de
fective.

CHICAGO. April 22.-In the corn pit tho
Phillips deal in May corn came to the fore
after a fortnight, during which lt -.-merely
kept the market nervous, but comparatively
narrow around "44c for May. Up to to-day
the opinion that the bull leader's vast line
had been gradually diminishing under cover
of , brokers had been spreading. This was
merely conjecture, however, for at times,
when . the market seemed inclined to boom'
there were indications that the wily manipu
lator was working to check any sudden
bulge. His announcement that he would take
in every bushel offered him on May con
tracts brought the paramount . importance of
Phillips' continued bullish attitude forcibly
Before traders. May 1, It Is estimated, there
will be 3,000,000 bushels of contract - corn
which can be delivered to him, but even this
would â¢ not satisfy his claims, as shorts have
guaranteed to deliver him between 5 000 000
and 7,000,000 bushels additional. That shorts
will be able' to get that amount here for de
livery before the last of May Is, of course,
food for doubt. The . fact .. that country of
ferings last night were practically nothing
and the receipts to-day were but
cars, with - only eight cars grading contract,
had much to do in alarming the gentlemen
who have on their, shoulders the burden of
getting this corn from country cribs or set
tling with Phillips. They scrambled in wild
confusion to-day for the privilege of taking
the loss already theirs, rather, than stand by
their guns in the hope that he. and his follow
ing would find themselves in deep .water be
fore May 1. To make his position more se
cure, it Is said, Phillips already has con
siderable corn ready for shipment East It
was a noteworthy fact to-day that :. while the
price level nearly the whole session was
higher than at any previous stage of the
crop very little was sold . far from the top
price. Phillips started the excitement by buy
ing at the opening. May opened %<S%c higher
at 44?Â»(Â§>44%c and bounded up to 46%c during
the forenoon. At this price every hull | pit
had a good profit in sight. Their sales caused
a reaction to 46c, but shorts absorbed everv
thinp with Â¦ such avidity that the market i re-'
acted sharply and closed 2c higher at 46%c
July sold between 4i Tic and 43c and closed 'l'ic
hleher at 44%c. . ..,-;,$
Trade in wheat was active. The market
for lt was the broadest in weeks, the activity
being sustained with scarcely â¢ an Interrup
tion. For the - first time In . days the favor
able weather and liberality of receipts were
Â¦ treated with contempt. A sharp advance at
Liverpool, bullish world's statistics and the
prospect of a fair visible decrease were Influ
ential at the start. May opening ',^c to %c

Nrji< York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 22.â The extraordinary
activity of the speculation is witnessed by the
record of the aEip-ejjate Eales for the day,
vl-.ich rc?e to 2.3S2.500 shares, compared with
the previous record en Friday of 2.193.4C0 shares.
The character of the market showed a marked
ihange from that of the latter part of last
week, when the tendency was distinctly up
ward throughout the list. There was great
variety in the speculation and extreme Irregu
larity in the movement of prices all day, and
there v.as .a resumption of the feverish tone
which had broken in on the present extended
advance of prices at various times. It was
obvious lhat there was very heavy profit taking
going on in stocks which have shown the great
ert strer.E^h recently, but the bulls had the
situation fairly well In hand through the early
part of the day and tha process of shifting the
fpmiiatlon from one set of stocks to another,
vhich has gone on in constant succession all
through the period of the rise, seemed to bÂ»
some on in a. normal manner. The weight of
the profit taking became so formidable, how
ever, and the violent manipulation of special
ttc rks by which it was sought to sustain prices
buanie so palpable that the hears made a pow
erful- conceited attack on the market In the
final hour. They forced prices down by rapid
*teps without meeting any support, taking the
market away from the bulls, who were eagerly
taking their profits. The relapse from the
li.fh pc:nt was very violent in 6ome stocks
and the level of the whole market was carried
Â¦noli under Saturday's close. The violence of
the decline invited some quick profit taking by
the bears, whose covering demand caused a few
t-harp rallies, but the general tone was weak
at the close. Except for a slump In Amalga
mated Copper at the opening the market started
oft with every appearance of a continuance in
full pwinjt of last week' 6 speculation for the
ris-e. Gains of 1 to 1*4 on initial purchases of
lrcrr. 1000 to 15,000 shares were, shown by a
number of the leading active flocks. Includ
ing St. Paul. Union Pacific, Missouri Pacific
cr.d Pennsylvania, anl Southern Pacific was
ruthed up 2H. The last-named stock was a
cor.rpiouous figure in the dealings, and even
alter the general market had commenced go
ine to pieces the price was advanced to S3Â»4.
v.-hich was 5^g over Saturday's close. St.
Pfiu!. after various fluctuations, rose as much
to 17?.. There were periods of strength also
smons the coalers, the local tractions, the
Pou tli westerns, Sugar and some other indi
vidual stocks. Pacific Mail was rushed up 6'4,
EpptriStly in sympathy with Southern Pacific.
The strength in the Southwesterns was on the
continued talk of consolidation with Chicago
Â«nd Alton and an entry into Pittsburg. These
extreme advaces came after the opening gains
h3d been pretty generaly wiped out under the
f!a.-<3 DC realizing selling, which has been the
feature of the morning dealings on every dav
fjecepding a notable advance. It was very
evident' that the bull leaders were using every
endeavor to turn the market upward in order
to revive 'the outside speculative buying. But
ibey did not succeed In reviving general
Â¦trtafcth at sny time. The upward movements
wre not accompanied generally by any news
j-nd were based almost wholly on the argu
ment that the pri^e paid for Burlington war
rnr.tr4 by contrast much higher prices for
l<raa:cally ell other railroad stocks. The bulls
soi'ght to make capital of the advertised invi
tation for subscriptions for the new British con
sol iFFue. as arguing confidence by bankers in
the fnture plenty of money, but the sharp rise
la i-t?rlins exchange rates lnÂ« response to the
larw subscriptions. Bald by the bankers having
th<--ni in' charge to be received for the loan.
<letrr.':ted from the force of this argument.
Oall loans did not rise ai>ove S per cent, owing
to Saturday's strong bank return. The -profit
\a".tirg on purchases made In anticipation of
that statement proved larger than the i new

Fruits and Salmon in London,
The London Grocers' Gazette of April 6 says
Falmonâ While the approaching holidays have
eÂ»lvÂ«>n!Â»ly influenced actual business transac
tions this week a considerable amount of ani
traticn has been shown owing to the heavy ar
rivalB which we reported last week by the Al
eternixe and the Strathdon. The Dlrigo has
arrived at Liverpool this week with several
thrufand cases from Ssn Francisco. Fruitsâ
California fruits have shown some amount of
activity at the lower rates reported last week
and the 'market may be quoted as slightly
above the lowest jwint touched. Prices of
Â¦pricota especially enpear now tempting
enouph to influence the large consumption
Mcenaqr to clear the market of the heavy
mpplies available for this reason.
Dried Fruits in Nr<v York.
Ms!! advices from New York say: "The
rr.y;l:c-t generally ccminr.es in a very unsatis
factory condition, an'l except in one or two
!ine:- there Is an almost ut'ter absence of any
thing worthy to be called trade. Prunes on
th<> wpat are sslling i:i a hand-to-mouth way
only, "and at prices V.\at are now very close
to the basis ruling on tin" coast. Arrivals from
the- coast are coming to hand more freely,
and. as buying has fallen off, supplies are
becoming plentiful. Practically no buying
Irom the coa*-'t on th 1 ; new basis is heard of
and it is certain that total sales In the New
Yosk market from California since the late
cut have numbered v;ry few cars.
â¢â¢Ka:s:r.s both on the spot and from the
coa<-t are absolutely btagnant. A little better
<".< mand is reported from country buyers for
aaxnxxe. and figs ar- firm and selling freely.
Apricots continue to attract some attention
from e;.oeu!ators. Th<! local house which has

London Market.
NEW YORK, April 21â The Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Only a fair business was done on the Stock
Exchange here to-day, and that was irregu
lar In tone. Interest was centered in the is
sue of the Â£60,000,000 of new console at SIM.
half of which was placed before the announce
ment was made. The syndicate to float the
issue is made up of big men in London, on the
Continent and In America. jThe mosf promi
nent names are the Rothschilds, Morgans, Cas
sel, Wernher and Belt, and It is said that. the
whole issue has already been over-subscribed.
It is believed also, however," that the sub
scribers will be disappointed, since so many
the holders of the old consols have sold out
in anticipation of the new issue that the price
of consols has been depressed to 94%. In con
sequence of this the premium of the new issue,
which at the opening was 1 per cent, declined
to one-half per cent.
American shares were subjected Â¦ to several
spasms to-day, but were on the whole fairly
firm until the opening in New York. There
was a sharp break, which was accompanied
by some talk of the floods, which affected
particularly the Atchisons, Eries and Norfolk
and Westerns. After that there was a gen
eral partial rally in the street under the lead
ership of a spurt tn St. Paul. The strongest
feature was Southern Pacific, which was
bought on a tip from' New York. Money is
scarce on a demand for deposit against the
new issue of consols.
Silver was strong on purchases for Â¦ the
CLOSING.
LONDON. April 22.â Atchison, 71%; Canadian
Pacific, 99; Union Pacific preferred, 91; North
ern Pacific preferred, 100% ; Grand Trunk, 9;
Anaconda. 10% ; bar Â¦ silver, strong, 27 15-16d ;

Taken From Her by Her
Husband, Who Then > 1^
Disappears.
With tears streaming down, her, cheeks
a handsome young woman entered the
office of the Bond and Warrant Clerk in
the Hall of Justice yesterday and asked
for a warrant for the arrest of her hus
band for kidnaping. The woman gave her
name as Maud Shaughnessy and her resi
dence Sacramento. Her husband is Henry
Shaughnessy, who Is well known In the
capital city.'
According to the woman's story she and
her husband and their two-year-old girl
arrived here three days ago from Sacra,:
mento and went to live in a lodging-house
on Eleventh street, near Mission. Short
ly after noon yesterday Shaughnessy In
duced his /wife and child to take a walk
with him. claiming that he was anxious
to see a friend who owed him money. As
they walked down Mission street Shaugh
nessy pretended that he was in need of
a drink of whisky, and picking up his lit
tle daughter he told his wife to wait a
few. minutes until he returned* from, a
saloon close* bv. --
Mrs. Shaughnessy waited for nearly
half an hour for the return of her hus
band and child and then, suspecting some
thing was ' wrong, she went into the
saicon and inquired for her husband. To
her great surprise she learned that he
had left the place by a rear door, taking
the child with him.
Frantic with grief and ! convinced that
she had been deserted and robbed of her
child, Mrs. Shaughnessy hurried to police
headquarters and asked for a warrant
for her husband's arrest.
i After the warrant had been issued Mrs.
Shauerhnessy. while riding in a Powell
stre<it car, espied her husband and child
sitting on the dummy. . The distracted
woman attempted to get possession of her
little girl, calling upon the passengers to
assist her. The conductor, however, took
the part of Shaughnessy and forced the
weman off the car. She managed to se
cure the shawl that was wrapped around
her child, and with this as a souvenir of
tho struggle, went to police headquarters
and pleaded with the officer In charge to
tind her child. â¢ â¢
"I know he intends to keep her from
me." she tearfully cried. "For God's sake
don't let him rob me of my only treas
ure." "Â¦â â¢ Â¦
Captain Seymour at once detailed two
of the men to find Shaughnessy with, in
structions to arrest him and the child.
As it is believed that he intends to re
turn to Sacramento Captain Seymour has
wired to Chief of Police Sullivan of that
city to take him into custody.

FOR HER CHILD
WASHINGTON. April 22.â In the) United
States Supreme Court to-day Chief Jus
tice Fuller announced the final adjourn
ment of the court of the term on May 27.
The call of the docket will be suspended
next Friday and the court will take a re
cess next Monday until May 13. No Inti
mation has been given by tbÂ« court as to
when the decision of the insular cases
may be expected, or whether they will be
decided at all before final adjournment.
An opinion was handed down to-day In
the case of H. I. Bedford vs. the Eastern
Building and Loan Association of Syra
cuse, N. Y. This grew out of tho
sale of stock in the building association to
Bedford and the making of a loan to him
in 1S91, he being a resident of Tennessee.
Bedford made default in the payment of
his note and pleaded the violation of a law
of Tennessee requiring the deposit of
funds by building associations doing busi
ness In the State. The court held, how
ever, that the loan was a contract, which
the act of the State Legislature could not
Impair.
The attention of the court was given to
day largely to the question of the right
of one State to quarantine against an
other. The contention arose in connection
with the case K W. P. Smith vs. the St.
Louis and Western Railway Company, in
volving quarantine regulations against
the importation of cattle in 1897. The cat
tle shipment upon which this case turned
was made by Smith over the St. Louis
road from Plain Dealing, La,, to Fort
Worth. Tex., the officials of the road be
ing unaware that a quarantine had been
established, which had been done by the
Texas officials. When the existence of
this restriction became known, the rail
road company refused to deliver the stock
to the consignee and reshlpped them to
Plain Dealing. Smith refused to receive
them, as he also did the proceeds of their
sale. Smith then brought suit for dam
ages, contending that the regulation was
an interference with interstate commerce
and unjustified by the facts.
The trial court sustained this regulation.
but the StatÂ© Court of Appeals reversed
the decision, holding: in favor of the com
pany. To-day's opinion affirmed the lat
ter decision on the ground that the State
has a right, under Its police power, to pro
tect itself against infectious diseases, even
though commerce may be incidentally In
terfered with in the regulations for such
protection. Justices Harlan and White
united In a dissenting opinion and Justice)
Brown delivered a dissenting opinion of
his own.
The principal op'ilon in the case was de
livered by Justice McKenna.
Opinion Is Rendered in' the
Case of Cattle Importa
tion.

SMITH IS DEFEATED
AND FATALLY INJURED
New York Pugilist Fares Badly at
the Hands of Jack
Roberts.,
LONDON, April 22.â At the National
Sporting Club, London, to-night, â¢ Jack
Koberts of Eng$land knocked out Billy
Smith, the American, in the eighth round.
The fight was for the nine-stone cham
pionship of England.
During the first three rounds everything
was In favor of Smith, who showed him
self decidedly the more clever of the two
men, but for the remainder of the contest
Roberts had his own way and he dealt
out a lot of severe body punishes. In the
eighth round Smith made no attempt
whatever to defend himself. He was
twice.knocked down and then counted out.
Subsequently it became known that
Smith's right arm was dislocated In the
fourth round, and- at the finish his legs
were badly cramped.
After the fight Smith was removed to
a hospital, where he was still unconscious
at 5 o'clock â¢ this morning. It is feared
that his injuries may prove fatal.
Billy Smith, who has received such seri
ous injuries In his contest with Jack Rob
erts, the undefeated featherweight of
England, is a New Yorker, and resides on
the east side of Manhattan Island. His
fighting in this country before he crossed
tho Atlantic showed him to be a boxer
of promise, and his American " friends
counted on his defeating Roberts, 2 al
though it was expected that he would
have a hard fieht on his hands.

mv.Â«: Georgia Hobson, born two o.-iyn ago
in Los aiiboIos, will rtgum in the most
novel and one of the most sensational law
suits ever tried In the courts of Colorado.
Mrs. Hobson has Bent word from Los
Ang-eles that she proposes to contest the
will of George H. Hobson, her late hus
band, which bequeaths the entire estate to
his brothers and sisters. The Hobson peo
ple have announced that they will con
test to the bitter end the threat of the
child's mother to secure the fortune for
her offspring. They will also charge
fraud, alleging- that Georgia is an adopted
child and that Georg-e H. Hobson is not
its father.
The will bequeaths $125,000 to be divided
equally between Mrs. Lizzie Anderson;
Hobson's sister, and his four brothers, all
of Pueblo. The wife's only benefit is his
life insurance, amounting to $3000. The will
was filed for probate November 19 last,
just a month after the testator's death.
In February last Mrs. Hobson filed in
court a statement that she was about to
become a mother and asked for an order
securing for her child a share in her hus
band's estate. Mrs. Anderson tried to se
cure a court order allowing physicians to
ascertain the truthfulness or falsity of
Mrs. Hobson's statement, but the court
denied the motion. Mrs. Hobson says she
will have no trouble in proving that the
child is her legitimate offspring. She is
now living with her parents at 1014 Bonny
Brae avenue, Los Angeles, where Georgia
was born.

with respect to the canal has occurred.
"The only argument against the Pan

preliminary report, said that the Panama
Canal was shorter and could be built for
$53,000,000 less, than the Nicaragua vMite,
excluding the 'cost of the concession. All
technical problems have been solved at
Panama, but they, have still to be de
termined at Nicaragua, The sanitary
conditions hare greatly improved at
Panama and there will be no such exces
sive death rate as would prevail at
Nicaragua. There j are excellent harbors
at Colon, and \ Panama and there are no
harbors on the Nicaragua route. I think
every engineer fully understands, the pre
pondering advantage of the Panama over
the Nicaragua route."

LOS ANGELES, April 22.â Mrs. LHHe
Ccnway, landlady of the Russell lodging
house at 516V4 South Main street, was shot
twice at 9:20 o'clock to-night by William
Nelson, an electrician, who had his room
In the hov.se. One bullet took effect in
the brain and the other entered Mrs. Con
way's !eft shoulder and plowed its way
through the lung. Tho woman died at
the Receiving Hospital shortly before 10
o'clock. Nelson made hia escape by the
back stairs into an alley, running from
Fifth to Sixth atreeta.
Nelson was until two weeks ago elec
trician at the Chutes, but was discharged.
Ho came from San Francisco several
montha ago and went to work at Wash*
Ington Gardens as ,*Â»m as tha Chutes
were owned. About two montha aeo he
took a room at tho Huaaell an<\ he liml
not boÂ»>u there )Â«og before ho madÂ© mi
vanoest to Mra, Conway. In order tQ In
gratiate himself with her, he asked her
\o take cure of his moneys Â«n<J she was
n> tho imhtt of keeping U for him until hÂ«
lieÂ«Kle<l it. -
Neloon went to the Russell to-night and
ran \u> the stairway lino the hall, where
thu landlady stood talking to MUs Hesmle
Hlitrley. With them was Mrs. Conway'a
Hlx-> ear-old daughter. Nelson spoka to
the ladles a moment and then remarked
that he wanted hi* money, as ho was
jroinff away.
Mrs. Conway and Nelson went tnta the
former's room. The voices of the two
were soon raised In dispute, and those
on the outside heard Nelson claim that
there was due him $25, while Mrs.'Con
way Insisted that she had but $20 belong
ing tn him.
A few moments later four shots were
flred in rapid succession; the door was
thrown open and Nelson, with a revolver
in his hand,' ran down the hall toward the
back stairs. As he reached the yard he
fired another shot, and it was t>elleved
that he had killed himself, but a search
made shortly after disclosed no trace of
him. . Â«
Mrs. Gonway was a good-looking woman
of 27 years and is supposed to have come
here from Cripple Creek two years ago.
Her husband is said to be there now.
Nelson is a well-built man of 32 years,
with red hair and red mustache and a
very freckled face. He is 5 feet 9 or 10
inches tall.

COMMISSION WANTS PAY
OF COPYISTS WITHHELD
Scrves Notice on Treasurer That Re
corder Godchaux Has Violated
Charter.
The Civil Service Commission addressed
a communication to the Treasurer yester
day, requesting that official not to pay
the salary demands of the four copyists,
who were recently appointed by Recorder
Godchaux. The reason assigned by the
commission is that the appointments were
made in violation of the civil service pro
visions of the charter. The Auditor has
refused to comply with a similar request.
In its communication the commission
says:
The charter confers xipon the Treasurer dis
cretionary powers in the payment of moneys
out of the treasury. Section 2, chapter III,
article IV of the charter provides that the
Treasurer shell not "pay out any part of such
moneys, nor allow the same to pass out of
Ms personal custody, except upon demands
authorized by law or this charter." Section
6 uf the same chapter and article adds: "But
the allowance or approval of the Auditor, or of
the Supervisory, or of any" department., board
or officer, of any demand which is not au
thorized by law or this charter, shall afford
no warrant to tho Treasurer for paying the
same."
The advice of the Auditor's attorney that
the Civil Service Commission shall "pursue the
remedy" cannot relieve the Auditor and the
Treasurer from their clear duty to decline to
audit or pay a demand against the treasury
that is susceptible of grave legal doubt.
ALAMEDA, April 22.-Battery and
disturbing . the peace are two\
heinous crimes that Dr. Wash-Â«
ington Dodge, San Francisyo's
Assessor of Values, will have to
answer for before Justice of the Peace
Morris. The doctor sees visions of him

her by the month.

finish of Mary. "She wanted to stay and
talk it all over, but I thought we had

Edward Eisner, the dramatlzer of Olga
Nethersole's production of "Under Two
Flags," is sure of a tropical interview with
actor James Neil when they meet. From
present Indications it looks as if the
meeting of the two men will be far more
dramatic than the tent scene in the play
when hero Bertie Cecil Royellieu and Cap
tain Chateauroy. alias "The Black
Hawk," fight with long swords and cut
big gashes In the atmosphere.
Neil" arrived in town yesterday with his
company, which opens at the California
Theater next Monday night. In his reper
toir.o is Edward Eisner's version of
Ouida's famous novel, of which Neil
claims to have the coast rights and which
he intended producing during his engage
ment in this city. He was surprised to
learn that the drama was being played
at tho Grand, Opera-house and upon a
visit to the theater he found that Eisner
had, besides renting the play tp him, also
leased it to "William R. Wilson, a theat
rical man. Wilson had sublet the play
for one week to Morosco, with the under
standing that he wouid buy all the scenic
effects, which Wilson would use on the.
road with a company that he is forming
In this city. " .
Neil last night said that he did not
blame either Wilson or Morosco for their
share in the transaction, but he spoke of
Klsner in very severe terms. Neil says
that he produced the play in Buffalo,
Seattle and Portland, Or., and did a big
business with it. -He says that he will
not produce it in this city though he
originally intended to and that he will
call Eisner to account for his action in
renting the play to two people when he
meets him.
Nell also made a contract with Miss
Alice Kausen of New York and Clarence
Brune for the production of Fanny
Devenport's old plays, "Fedora" and "La
Tosca."Â» Nell saya that when he rented
the plays he was shown a contract which
was signed by Melbourne McDowell in
which McDowell relinquished all rights to
the plays. It now appears that McDowell
will shortly appear at the Grand Opera
house in both "Fedora" and "La Tosca"
and he claims that he made no contract
with anybody authorizing the production
of the plays.

Dense mystÂ»ry surrounds the where
sboutE or fate of George A. Snook, the
aged retired merchant, who disappeared
from his home. 19U Broadway, on April
V2. Despite the fact Mr. Snook has been
a resident of San Francisco Blnce 1843 and
possessed the most extensive acquaint^
anee. no living eoul has been found who
paw the oM gentleman after he left his
home early on the morning of his disap
pearance while the household was yet
:iFleep.
Mr. Snook has not been engaged In ac
tive business for more than a year. Sev
eral months ago his mind gave evidence
<>f weakening under the burden of advanc
ing years, and he had been confined to his
liome for many months under the care of
r.is daughters, until he was missed from
hu accustomed place at the breakfast
table ten days ago. No results have been
realized from the persistent and diligent
search instituted at once for the missing
man.
Mr. Snook's family at once enlisted the
perviror of former Chief of Police I^?es, a
life-long friend, and in addition to the
thoroughly organized search find inquiry
made by detectives working under Lees'
F.uprrvision an army of the old man's
neighbors have lent their aid in poring
over the records of hospitals and Journey
ins: to different points in the State, where
(-â¢â¢me trace of the wanderer might be dis
rovered.
Since the morning Mr. Snook left his
home hie daughters have been prostrated
ivith prief. Hi* continued absence has at
last naturally friven risfi to the fear that
the helpless man has lost his life while
hi boring under an aberration of the mind.
Jnmrs A. Snook, a nephew of the old
merchant, has Iieen most active in invest-
Jcatinpr every clue likely to lead to some
iraee of his unHe and searching In every
dlractloa to locate his remains, should he
h.ivo lnf=t his life while mentally deranged.
He said last night he had practically
alinndoned al! hope of ever seeing his ven
rratile relative alive. â¢
The search will be continued in an at
tempt to get possession of Mr. Snook's
body in the event he has been made the
victim of foul play or been accidentally
killed.
George A. Snook established the first
plurnMnp business in San Francisco In
3K43. It jrrew into a profitable enterprise,
and the firm of G. & E. Snook has always
*Â»n.1cyc-d an enviable position in the busi
ness world of the eljy. - .
Mr. Snook is a widower and passed his
Fpvcnty-piphth birthday shortly before his
disappearance. The death of his wife sev
eral years ago preyed upon the old man's
mind to such an extent that he was com
pelled, about eighteen months ago, to
abandon all business cares. Since then
lie had lived .at his handsome home on
Broadway, surrounded and cared for by a
Jarpe family of daughters.

world if Miss Mary Beasley hadn't had
him arrested. - ~
Mary has been Dodge's .servant girl
over since the family took the house at
1303 Lafayette street three weeks ago for
the summer. She didn't come up to all
the requirements of a modern housemaid,
but- in view of the stringency of the ser
vant girl market, she was tolerated. She
had an unwarranted notion at times that
she was proprietress of the house. Then
she would make figure 8's on the pol
ished kitchen floor'and say unkind things
to the mistress.
But the limit of patience was reached
last nisrht when Mary cut in on a parlor
full of company and demanded her wages.
It was very embarrassing, of course, but
Dr. Dodge rose to the occasion; he hap
pened to have the price in his pocket,
encd to have us all arrested, but I didn't
think she'd do it. It is ridiculous for her
to charge me with these crimes." - -
1)o hear Mary's story is to hear a terri
ble tale of abuse and great bodily injury.
The tortures of the rack are easy com
pared with the frightful | ordeal she suf
fered/at the hands of Dr. Dodsre.

-A prize was also, offered for the most
popular young lady In the eyes of the
German colony. Everybody was drawn
into the Â¦ two contests, and when the
judges Â¦ declared the results the victors
were made to appreciate the honors of
such distinction.
From the start. Miss F. M. Hays led the
procession - in Â¦ the contest to be- voted the
most beautiful young lady. While many
others disputed with her for the prize
there were none who could come up to the
standard set by the judges, and Miss Hays
triumphantly walked off with the prize.
In the contest for the 1 most popular
young lady a great latitude was afforded.
Miss Anna Gerichten carried off this prize
with such a decided majority that even
her rivals were constrained to willingly
relinquish to her the palms of victory.
Pitted against her were many charming
young ladies, who, although defeated,
frankly admitted that no better choice
could have been made.
In the shooting contest, ten prizes were
distributed among the most expert marks
men, the leaders of the Verein Eintracht
Schuetzen section being mainly distin
guished for their marksmanship. Valua
ble prizes' were given to each of the lead
ing contestants in the various shooting
classes. The winners in the order of pre
cedence were: H. Bender, H. Stettin, W.
Harker, H. Kuhls, Captain F. G. Kuhls,
C. Auer, L. Streit, O. Ludwlg, D. J. Han

MISS GERICHTEN, THE MOST POP
ULAR v YOUNG WOMAN AT VE
REIN EINTRACHT FAIR. -
Many a successful man begins at the
top of the ladder and goes downâ when he
has business in the cellar.
Mining and financial circles were aeos
with excitement yesterday over the newj
published In The Call that Henry Brat
nober, the well-known and popular mining
expert and capitalist, had sailed from.
London for home after clearing up more
than five million dollars In the modern
Babylon.
When the Klondike excitement was at
its height Bratnober went to the Arctic
region for the Rothschilds, backed by un
limited capital. He â¢ became acquainted
in Dawson with Jack Dalton, the man who
founded the famous Dalton trail, and the
; two became fast friends.
On returning from Dawson Bratnober
severed his connection with the Roths
childs and branched out for himself. He
, associated himself with the late Thomas
Mein, A- Wartenweiler, J. H. Sayre and
others who are prominent in nr.an.cial
, circles.
One year ago Bratnober revisited tha
Klondike and returned to this city with
Jack Dalton. The two started for Lon
don just before Christmas and Bratnober
at the time stated he was "out for bis
game." ~
It Is understood that Henry Callahan, a
mining expert, is the man, who gave cer
tain information to Bratnober. that the
latter used to great advantage.
Whitaker Wright Remembered.
Hundreds 1 of people in this State have
reason to remember Whitaker Wright,
who visited California about twenty years
ago, ifnd was the head of many disastrous
mining ventures in Lake County. Wright
finally dropped from sight and went to
London, where he ingratiated himself
with members, of the aristocracy, mem
bers of Parliament and other prominent
men. He then went to Australia and
started the "Lake View Syndicate" of
mines and the British public swallowed
the bait with avidity. Money fairly
poured into the coffers of Wright and his
associates and the arch-promoter became
a financial pillar in London. He secured
a footing in the "London and Globe Syn
dicate," a solid concern, and sold the di
rectors considerable stock of the "Lake
View" mines In Australia.
Henry Callahan. a mining expert, was
sent from London to Australia by the
London and Globe Company to report on
the Lake View mines, and he left Aus
tralia for home & few weeks ago, passing
; through San Francisco on his return trip.
Bratnober became acquainted with Calla
han when he passed through this city
en route to Australia and it is generally
understood that Callahan gave Bratnober
a tip to "watch Lake View stock."
Stock Bulled and Beared.
When Bratnober went to London last
winter he "beared" the stock and secured
a large number of shares. "When the
market was "bulled" by favorable reports
from Australia, the London and Glove
Syndicate eagerly bought up all the stock
it could lay its hands on and Bratnober
and his friends are reported to have
cleared up by the transaction more than
five million dollars.
Bratnober sailed from England on Sat
urday on the Lucania and his friends are
eagerly awaiting his return to this city.
A. "Wartenweiler. who shares offices in
the Crocker building- with Bratnober, de
clined to give any Information as to the
big deals made in London by Bratnober.
"I know that he made money during the
winter," said Wartenweiler in speaking 1 of
Bratnober, "but I have no information as
to this last transaction. I had a cable
from him a week ago saying: he was com
ing home."
Mrs. Bratnober moved from the Palace
Hotel to Piedmont when her husband
went to Europe and lives in a palatial
home in the suburban city. "When Brat
nober arrives in San Francisco he is
bound to receive a hearty welcome and
details of his good fortune are eagerly
awaited. ".

The ladies and gentlemen engaged in
this extraordinary farrago are entitled to
our respectful sympathy. Mr. Webster
and Miss Stone, as the most intelligent,
must have suffered the most. They have
each an excellent stage presence, a well
trained voice and a quiet strength of man
ner which show that if only they were
riven a play they could not fail to interest
and to move us.
The character of Cigarette Is that of a
vivandiere whose constant talk is of broil
and battle, who thirsts for the blood of
Arabs defending their country against in-*
vading tyrants, who smokes and swears
and drinks like the veriest jack-trooper
of them all. This tigress-in-boots has a
very pretty affection for the hero, who
evidently does not "know the difference
between life and rhetoric." This affection
works itself out in a series of incidents
that require the assistance of horses, re
volvers, sabres, thunder, lightning and
dust storms to make them go off. And
there's your play! A troglodyte would
weep at having to sit through it and two
performances would shatter the constitu
tion of a cave-man.
Throughout the remaining acts the au
thor endeavors to carry your sympathy
for a hero who, in this aforesaid first act,
has committed an absurd and altogether
unnecessary piece of self-sacrifice. This
makes the sentiment of the entire play
ring false; instead of pitying your hero
and sympathizing with him you feel only
& languid contempt for a man who has
richly deserved every misfortune that has
fallen upon him.
IT IS really sad to contemplate the
amount of human effort that goes
into such a production as "Under Two
Flags" (Morosco's) and then to real
ize how utterly wasted has been the
greater part of this effort. To begin with,
it must have required a considerable,
combined exertion on the part of Ouida,
the ungrammatical, and her tedious
adapter. M. Eisner, to unite an act as in
geniously bad as the first act presented
last night; such dummy characters, such
clumsy construction, such tawdry senti
ment! Xever, burely, was there a compli
cation brought about by such mechanical
devices, with such an absolute disregard
of probable motives, with such childish
assurance that the audience would accept
anything the author chose to throw at
them.

Golden Gate' Camp No. 64, Woodmen of

tion to his humorous sayings Grant has a
good song full of rhyming wit and a sen
timentarrecltation that proves his versa
tility. All these good, bits in Grant's fa
vor ought to make him the headliner on
this week's programme, but the bill is so
full, of good things that he is only one
of many. Barnes and Sissons in a farcical
travesty, "The Mysterious Pill," a telling
act full of fun; Mil*. Adelaide, a dainty
bit of femininity, who dances and balances
herself on a wire rope;Mme. Marion von
Schradei'. a lady with a splendid soprano
voice and an operatic reputation, and
Clayton, Jenkins and Jasper in a dark
faced specialty/tf'The Darktown Circus,"
are the other new numbers on the pro
gramme that win the approval of the
audience. The holdovers include Josephines
Gassman and her pickaninnies' in an en

and her clever company in her last week'.*

Horace Goldin in his mysterious illusions.

and was presented satisfactorily. The
scenery was more than usually elaborate

sufficient to keep up the interest in what
is otherwise a weak play. The company

individual communion cups at the weekly
meeting of the Methodist ministers yes

he had inaugurated their use in his church

dashes a glass of wine in the officer's face

self in the second act, when, finding
Yvonne in a country inn, where she has
gone to meet her soldier brother, he de

appeals to his chivalry, however, and he
leaves her. only for her to fall into worse
hands in the person of the landlord of the
inn, Bobeche. Yvonne, in the dark, im

of his good resolution, and remains in ig

her, himself kills the landlords She> for
the insult offered her, tries to kill, him,

The second scene Is one of simply tre
mendous power. It struck sparks from
first to last. The others are more loosely
knit, the interest rather petering out in
the necessary explanations toward the
last, but the play is one of strong inter

ONE' of the most exciting .'. contests
at the recently closed .fair of the
.Verein Eintracht was that for
the honor of being declared the
â¢ most beautiful â¢ young. \. lady.
A host of candidates entered the lists,
and -as each one had hundreds of
admirers it was not until the result was
announced in the early hours of Monday
morning that the name of the winner
'John B. Moisant. under- the name of
John Moore, is a fugitive from Justice and
Captain Seymour, who has a warrant' for
his arrest on the charge of felony embez
zlement, has wired to .Iteming and El
Paso, hoping that he maybe captured at
one of these points, as he Is believed to be ,
on his' way to Mexico with his kidnaped
child and ; valuable securities belonging to
R. Dannmeyer, stock broker/ 100 Front
street; who is his wife's uncle. . ".' â¢
The warrant was sworn to before Judge
Cabaniss . yesterday morning by Dann
meyer, who accuses Moisant of embezzling
500 shares of Consolidated California and
Virginia Mining Company's' stock of the
value of $1200. â¢ Moisant got the shares
Friday to negotiate an oil deal, but he
did not do anything in the" matter, and
when he failed to make his appearance
Saturday, Dannmeyer became suspicious.
He made inquiry and learned that Moi
sant had called upon his wife, who is
living in this city with her mother, and
had asked as a favor to be allowed to
take' their child to the Orpheum for the
matinee. The husband and wife have been
living apart for some years.; Moisant did
not return* with the child.
Dannmeyer notified Captain Seymour
yesterday morning, and it was soon dis
covered that Moisant had left on Satur
day evening's train for El Paso en routÂ©
for Mexico, and it is presumed that he
has the child with him.
It is alleged . that Moisant took other
securities belonging to Dannmeyer with
him. Â¦ Some are not negotiable and are
only of value to Moisant personally. â¢
Moisant has been connected in business
with Dannmeyer for the . past thirteen
years, and has been residing in San Sal
vador. He arrived in this city a few days
ago, and it is believed that his principal
object was to secure possession of his
child. Other charges will probably ' be
made against him if he should be ar
rested. : . Â¦ â¢ - Â¦ .
Late last evening Captain Seymour re
ceived the following dispatch from Dem
ing, N. M.: .........
Man on train. Could 'not get him off. . Have
wired to J. H. White, Chief of Police at El
Paso, Texas, to hold him.
- . I.EWIS I. MARSHALL. Justice.
Charles F. 6'Callaghan, attorney for
Dannemeyer, was seen last e\ r ening at his
residence and positively refused to give
any Information as to the alleged embez
zlement by Moisant. The attorney pro
fessed to be in ignorance of the residence
of Dannemeyer and also of Mrs. Moisant.
â¢ An- hour after O'Callaghan was seen he
visited Captain Seymour, at the. Hall of
Justice in company with a man named
Prescott. The attorney was shown the
dispatch from New Mexico, but did not
vouchsafe- the detective any information
that might be of value.
The detective department has not been
furnished with 'the address of Mrs. Moi
sant, and Dannemeyer is as. silent as his
attorney regarding information as ' to
whether Mrs. Moisant will charge her
husband with kidnaping her child. The
lady did not visit police headquarters and
the detectives .were unable to locate her
last night. : . \
The Police Department is of the opinion
that Dannemeyer and Moisant have had
a family and business quarrel and that
the- charge of felony embezzlement has
but little foundation.
J. B; Moisant Is Accused
of Stealing Bonds .
Worth $1200.
It Is Also Alleged That He
â¢ Is a Fugitive and a
Kidnaper. '

Conquerors"; it has an excellent thing in
the two first acts of the play. The story
of "The Conquerors" Is briefly as follows:
The scene is laid in Brittany, during the
evening and night following the battle of
Sedan, September 3, 1870. The chateau
Grand Pre in Dinan is occupied by the
Prussians, whose presence is bitterly re
sented by the owners thereof. . an old
Orpheum.
Alf Grant, in a specialty down on the
bills as "Pictures Taken From Life,;'
ought to Bucceed this week in proving to
the Orpheura patrons that there are a few
jokes not old enough to be out of swad
dling clothes and that those selfsame
of Bodeche,'put in with clean, One touch
by Charles Bryant, and the rest of the
characters are all adequately cast. The
stage management leaves something to be
desired, over-long waits, and. ragged ends
here and there, but "The Conquerors" is
much . the best thing that the Alcazar
boards have seen for many, a moon. .
"The Conquerors" is a Strong Play and Makes a Great
| Hit at the Alcazarâ ' The Evil Eye" at the California.
Good Show at the Orpheumâ "A fair Rebel" at Cental
