liavid Bispham gave a number of bary
tone selections, the recital lasting one
and three-quarters hours. The selections
were chiefly from Schubert, Schumann
and American composers like McDowell
and Walter Damrosch.
Bispham was in good voice and at times
received nearty and enthusiastic ap
plause. Critics appear to agree that while
some other singers may surpass Bispham
in range of voice.technlque and experi

powers of artistic expression. AH in all,

Meredith was denounced as a brute from
the pulpit In Seattle to-day. Many of the
ministers made his acts the subject of
denunciatory: discourses. The city is
greatly excited and the outcome is hard
to figure out.
It all arose over what is termed the
outrageous action of the Chief in arrest
ing II. R. Cayton, colored editor of the
Seattle Republican, a weekly paper, on
a charge of criminal libel. The Chief
himself Is tne prosecuting witness. He
took offense at what Cayton said In his
last issue about the Chief's declared In
tention to make war on alleged quack
doctors. Cayton commented on the Chiefs
proposed programme, and injected a few
sentences about the local condition of
politics. . '
Instead of arresting Cayton in the day
time the Chief waited until late at night,
then he got a Justice of the Peace out
ot a theater and swore cut a warrant.
Cayton was dragged from his home and
thrown Into Jail. Mrs. Cayton was, al
most distracted because she had not the
slightest idea what the strange proceed
ings meant.
She hurried to her attorneys, who went
to police headquarters and asked to see
Cayton. They were met with a cold re
fusal.. Then they asked for information
of the charge and where the warrant was
issued. The oollce had nothing to say.
AH the Justices of the Peace, were routed
out of bed, and finally the one who gave
the warrant was found. He said he would
accept (500 bail. Then the police demand,
ed cash.
At 3 o'clock In the morning James D.
Hoge, president of the FlrBt National
Hank, offered Ms check to the police for
1300. The chuck was refused. Hoge went
around the city and finally gathered up
the cash and got Cayton out at 3:30
o'clock. When the actions of the police
became generally known the row started,
and there was no stopping It. The min
isters took it up, and to-night the town is
wild with excitement over what is termed
an outrage and an insult to the people of

WASHINGTON, March 24.â Maryland
Democrats have aroused national Repub

forward again the long deferred issue of
the disfranchising of colored voters in
the Southern and border States. It is
likely to become one of the great political
questions of the day.
Leading Republican members of Con

men who are entitled to It under the

be pressed for passage enforcing the four

: ' NEW YORK, March 24.â The committee

In regard, to driving out vice from the

\oted considerable time to this question,

it into the field, and- it is expected the
full committee will go to. Albany on Tues
day, when a hearing on the report of tho
Tenement Committee will be heard, be
fore the city's committee of the Legis
lature. The letter reads in part as fol
lows:
"The greatest of existing evils is tho
intrusion and wide extension of prostitu
tion in the tenement houses, the houses
in which the great mass of wage earners
are compelled to live. There will proD
ably for a long time to come continue to
"be differences of opinion as to the degree
in which it is possible to check social
vice in our great cities, but there can be
no two opinions as to the necessity of
protecting children of tender years from
close connection with depravity. An 'In
timate acquaintance with adult vice
should at least not be forced upon young
children by permitting such vice to pene
trate into the very houses in which they
live. The crv of parents when they ask
merely for the opportunity of bringing up
their children in an atmosphere, free from
the pollution of the most degrading
forms of moral evils, should surely be
heeded." . . - "
The letter says that the law on the
statute books has. not met the situation
and what is needed is a law that will
place the responsibility for : the existence
of vice in thi tenements on the shoulders
of the landlords. This, . the committee
says, tho legislation proposed by the

The first' thing is to get possession of
them, and afterward to proceed to such

The treaty of Ancon places , the two
countries in an equality of position, but
Chile has a greater Interest than Peru in
obtaining them- and 'can offer -them a fu

Peru neither wishes nor is able to do more
than to return them to the state of. neg

gravest that can threaten a nation.
-The President has definitely* decided,
however, than he will not take action un

The past week has seen a great in

over $1000 having been contributed. It is
believed now that the fund will reach
$7500. At a meeting of the general com
mittee last night, at which Director Gen

aside for the decoration of the streets
and the construction of arches.
It has been decided to dispense with
a queen of the carnival, although $1000
or more might be realized by the sale of
votes. The consensus of opinion is that
with Mrs. McKinley here it would be
improper to divide the honors due her
with any local favorite.

artificial propagation of salmon. They, say
if the regulations are enforced the can

count of the additional expense, and prop

threatened with destruction. . They ask
the Government to abrogate or suspend
these . regulations and appoint a commis

sites for hatcheries to . be built by the

Chartrey. to maintain the training school

During the past week thirty- two names
of , candidates for election as directors o*
the- society had been posted. Chartrey is
credited with having made an active -cam-^
palgn, spending money freely to drum up
votes. On Thursday last the "League of
Henri IV" combined Â¦ forces with ; tfie
"Julien"-men, with the -object. of secur
ing the downfallof Chartrey and his ad
nerents. A slate was prepared of fifteen
strong candidates, pledged to select J. M.
Dupaa for the" office of "president. Â¦ â¢â¢Â¦"- -
Chartrey begged to be allowed to figure
on the slate, but the "Bearnais" would
not hear of It. Chartrey, in a fit of dli
gust, withdrew his name and those of hla
candidates from the ballot,' and all his en
ergy was directed to defeat Dupas for
president. Â¦ .
At yesterday's meeting the various
amendments and propositions of mem
bers came up for adoption. The big fight
of the day was made on the proposal to
abolish the training school for nurses.
Chartrey took the floor and claimed that
the school was a financial success and
that It should be continued. This state
ment raised an uproar.
Student Nurses Forced to Go.
A. Goustiaux delivered an Impassioned
speech in which he demanded the abolish

was of no use and prolific of scandal.

and said that the scandalous conduct of
some of the nurses had brought the hos

Formal recognition of the employment
of spies by the United States is made in
the last army appropriation law. An ap
propriation of $2,400,000 Is. authorized for
Incidental expenses,, among M'hich are
"hire of laborers. In the Quartermaster's
Department, including the hire of Inter
preters, spies or guides for the army."
This provision has created much com
ment among military attaches of foreign
governments ln ! Washington. They admit
the universal practice of using spies, but
they say it Is not- customary abroad to
acknowledge the fact as openly as the
United States does. The War Department
declines to give any facts concerning the
employment of spies, â¢ but it 13 admitted

It has been announced that a distinguished citizen
of Chicago who has been detected in the' commission
of such smart tricks as forging checks, and selling

who started such an agitation for that form of dress
last summer; and now the dudes are hunting round
for a new leader. . .
THERE is a confusion of tongues in various Par
liaments and Legislatures just now that is more
amusing than serious.' It began in the Austrian
Reichsrath, where 'Czech and German meet. The
Czech members two years ago insisted upon speaking
their own tongue and refused to understand any pro
ceedings in German. The. result was a daily fisticuff
and choking match on the floor. Desks were broken,
heads were cracked and the transaction of business
became impossible. These disorders have been re-.
newed in the same chamber. The Czechs swear great
caths in that capacious language, . make speeches
therein, defy the presiding officer and overrun all rules
of order. Every session ends in a fight, and black
eyes and split noses are proudly exhibited by the
statesmen on both' sides as evidence of their loyalty
to the mother tongue. When the British Parliament
met the Irish members took their cues from the
Czechs and have been making speeches in Irish, en
joying the great comfort of - saying their # full mind
about the hated Sassenach in a language he does not
understand while he has to sit and take it.
One time O'Conndl went to Connemara to make
a speech on Catholic emancipation, in which it
was expected that he would transcend the limits 'â¢; of
permitted speech and lay himself liable to, arrest
Therefore reporters ..were sent along to take him
down verbatim. When he rose he said to these gen
tlemen, "Are you ready?" They responded that they
were, whereupon he proceeded to make an impas
sioned speech in Irish/understood by all his auditors,
but an entirely unknown tongue to the reporters. *
There is only one bar to the pleasure of the presen:
Irish members in following his example, and that is"
in their desire to not only free their minds, very
freely, about the Sassenach, but their wish that he may
know the words and phrases in which ; the- freeing is
done.

Complaint is made in the Italian navy
that the language of the country is not
receiving encouragement as a study.
It has hitherto been customary to^have
an annual competitive examination of the
midshipmen in either French, German,

tional, and for which there were $50 prizes.
Recently Italian has been withdrawn from
the prize list and a. not unreasonable ex
ception has been taken to ignoring the

The submarine boat question has be
come one of great Importance, and is se
riously considered since our navy has
given encouragement to inventions in that
line and ordered seven Hollands. No se
rious attention was apparently paid to the
submarine boats of France, but the Amer
ican boat 'Â¦ will shortly ' be found in the
British navy, and Admiral Boerreson- of
the Norwegian navy has recommended the
purchase of a Holland boat. That sort of
craft is especially well adapted fpr the
coast and fjords of Norway, the admiral
contending that .with one ofÂ« these sub
marine vessels,' requiring only four men to
operate it," it will be . possible - to ;. Inflict
more destruction on an enemy than with
a battleship -manned by a crew of 300.

twenty barrels a year. The first organized
and .successful effort to bore for petro
leum wa3 made in 1S54 by a New York
company along Oil Creek, New York.
After that oil fields were located in other
parts of New York and Pennsylvania,
Ohio and West Virginia. Petroleum was
found 100 years ago In making the Duke
of Brldgewater tunnel at Wol3ey, at WÂ«st
Leigh in Lancashire and the coal fields

barrels a day. There are records of the
finding of petroleum in St. Bores. Basse

SAND BLASTâ D. P. B., City. The sand
blast is .a method of engraving on glass,

force of a rapid stream of sand driven
against either. The process was invented
by General B. C. Tighman of Philadelphia,
and was first- patented In October, 1S70
The Jet of sand may be driven by. a blast
of Bteam from a boiler at high, pressure
or by an. air blast produced by a fan re
volving at a great velocity.. The sand is
contained in a hopper and through a tube
witha line orifice is directed against the
object which , is to be cut or engraved
The blast pipe surrounds the tube and the
object to be operated upon is placed in a
box and adjusted so that it can be moved
as the figures are cut. Ornamental flir
ures are engraved on glass by this p-o
cess by placing upon it stencils of the
objects to be formed. The sand blast is
; used in the cutting of ornaments and in

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
In the local markets there was more going on last
week. Provisions led iff with an advance, and wheat
and barley followed. Hides sold off somewhat. There
was continued improvement in prunes, and most sizes
are getting scarce. The depression in this fruit is
about over, and if the current demand keeps 'up there
will not be a good prune left in the State when the
new crop comes forward, though dealers expect to
carry over a quantity of very small and otherwise in
ferior fruit. Even this, however, is now meeting with
seme demand and may sell off better than expected.
Other dried fruits are meeting with an improved in
quiry, and the canners have already entered the field
for fresh fruits, such as peaches, plums, apricots,
pears, etc. This is earlier than the canners usually
buy and the prices paid are very fair. Custom-house
clearances show ?. continued large export business to
Northern and . South American ports, Pacific. islands
and the Orient. Altogether the outlook is even bet
ter thin it was last year at this time, which is saying a
rood deal.
Almost everything seems to be tending .upward.
Hogs and hog products made a general advance early
in the week, and hogs are reported scarce all over the
country. Pig iron and finished steel continue to ad
vance. Wheat and barley are quoted distinctly higher
thÂ«;n tlify were a fortnight ago, though v the advance
has been timid and liesitating. A number of minor
staples have also risen more or less. Even wool, so
long neglected, is showing more tone, and there is
no longer any tendency to cut qudtations at Eastern
centers. Cotton, however, still drags. Prices are off
again, receipts from the South are free and prepara
tions for the new crop indicate an enormous acreage.
The spurt in boots and shoes is less pronounced and
fancy, high-priced- lines are easier, though the staples
show no weakness.
Merchandise seems to be in very good shape every
where. The retail trade, which has been active in the
West for some time, has greatly, improved along the
Atlantic seaboard and a good spring business is now
expected in the latter .section. The railroads are doing
a very large business, which is one of the best of
signs. Their earnings thus far in March show a gain
of 10.8 per cent ovtr the same month . in 1900
and 36 per cent over 1899. In fact, they are
doing so much business that the supply \ of
cars is seriously inadequate to handle all the
freight offered, as the orange shippers of California
know to their sorrow. This is the case almost every
where in the country, and, though the different lines
hare recently placed large orders for cars with West
ern works, it will be some time before they can be
turned out ready for use.
Wall street developed considerable .strength and
activity during the week, notably in steel and railroad
stocks. The firmness attracted the attention of the
public, who reappeared in the street as purchasers.
During the week the strained situation at Tientsin gave
the market a setback, not only in Wall street but on
the foreign bourses, and a selling movement set in,
but the easing off of the Russian. and British strain re
lieved the tension and the market again took an up
ward turn. 'Â¦>
TRADE IMPROVEMENT MAINTAINED.
THE first quarter of 1901 is closing cheerfully,
â¢with no disturbing indications in any section of
the country. The bank clearings still show ex-
I-andirg business, those last week being 51.2 per cent
over the same week in 1900* with only one important
city in the country â Minneapolis â showing a falling
off. The gain at New York was 66 per cent, showing
probably increased activity in the stock market, ami
at Pittsburg 49.4 per cent, showing just that much
improvement in the iron and steel trades. Chicago,
where the wheat and provisions are bought and sold,
showed an increase of 18.3 per cent. The failures for
the week were 231, against 192 for the same week last
vear Â¦ ',- .

Any procedure more different from fire fighting in
this country it would be difficult to imagine among a
civilized people. There, is one feature of it that will
fill Americans with' wonder. What would be thought
here of a set of firemen who after putting out the
flames, should proceed to clear away the rubbjsh,
scrub the floor and make a general clean up before,
leaving? We can teach Berlin much in the way of
machinery, and surprise her by the promptness with
which our firemen act, but in the house-cleaning
touch she is ahead of us.
The difference between our methods of fighting
fire and those that obtain in Berlin is shown by the
statements of an Americjin who had an experience
with the Fire Department in that 'city. He occupied
an apartment on the third: floor of a ifour-story,.build
ing, and, according to his story as told in the New-
York Times, this is what happened:
One morning he was aroused by the smell of. smoke,
and on examination found a fire smoldering down
through the ceiling of his dining room.-' He' rushed to
tho corner and turned in the electric alarm. No one in
terfered with this, but -as he started to return he. was
courteously but emphatically requested by a policeman
who had impassively watched the proceeding to remain

Irrelevant. â¢ There was probably no occasion for so much

apparatus assembled in a quiet and orderly way. There
was no frantic excitement, little clanging of gongs, and
no shouting. As It was. a "third-class fire," the first
and second class engines were sent home again, and
the third class firemen took fhÂ© matter in hand. In
stead of deluging thebuilding with water, they did the
work with chemical apparatus, and had the fire out
before any serious damage had been done. The fire
men then swept up the rubbish and carried it away,
and astonished the housekeeper. by scrubbing the floor
of the room In which a part of. th& ceiling had fallen.

The exhibition promises a very goÂ«d opportunity
for American manufacturers of fire-fighting machin
ery to find a good market for their products, and also
for American firemen to show their superiority in
all the work a fireman is called upon to perform.
If anything like a genuinely representative exhibit

It is further announced: "Thc-object of the exhi
bition is not only to give manufacturers of every coun
try an opportunity to notify others of the present
state of this branch, but also to bring the represen
tatives of fire brigades of differerft nations -in closer
contact, with .one another. We cordially invite muni
cipal authorities, fire brigade associations, national
unions, manufacturers, mill-owners and interested
parties of every country to compete, and respectfully
lequest the same to 'energetically promote i the object
jr. view, and especially by exhibiting suitable appara
tus and the like."
The date for the exhibition was chosen so as to
make the occasion serve as a celebration of the fif
tieth anniversary 'of the organization of the Berlin
Fire Brigade. The German ; authorities are well
pleased with the record of the brigade, and the note to
our Government says: "The organization at Berlin
has been the means of starting in Germany a new
epoch of development in connection with apparatus
or means for the extinction of and protection against
fire; and thanks are due to such organization and
the experience directed therefrom, whereby it has
been possible, by increasing the fire protecting
means, to put a check on the dangers. threatening in
consequence of the rapid development of technics and
industry." . / .

talked and talkedâ of something else. 1 *
Maybe, this modern instance is to teach the nations
and races that*it is better each should. flock by. itself
and manage its own civilization and institutions.
Perhaps there is the same ; wise and Providential
purpose in this confusion of tongues that appeared
in that original parliament of man that undertook to
get above high water mark by' building the Tower oi
Babel. That was for the purpose' not only of stopping
work, but to disperse man, eachtribe and kindred by
difference of speech, from the others' being compelled
to go by itself.
its members are natives who either, cannot or will not
speak English. They insist on debating in the liquid
language of their fathers, with its even flow of, vowels
seldom interruptedly a consonant. This is disagree-'
able to the white members, who are accustomed to
the corduroy course of English in which consonants
interrupt like chuckholes across a speed track. The
Speaker of the "Hawaiian House is half Chinese arid
half Hawaiian, and is a sort of' polyglot megaphone,
talking all three languages; fluently, so that he is not
disturbed by the situation.
How different all that is from the wild reports that
have been given of President Hadley's addresses in
the East the public will readily perceive. It has been
stated that he advocated social ostracism of all who
engaged in organizing and maintaining trusts, and
that he had declared there is danger there will be an
imperial government established at Washington,
within twenty-five years unless public sentiment be
changed. â¢ No such doctrines can be fairly drawn even
by inference from his statements. His appeal is sim
ply for a higher code of collective honor, and as such
merits the thoughtful and serious attention' of the pub
lic at large as well as of academic audiences.
We need then a social code that will set our "gentle
men" to work in the right way. That code, of course,
cannot be formulated by statute. It must be the out
growth of the intelligence and the virtue of the best
men and the best women in a. community. In the de
velopment of such a code President Hadley sees his
only hope of the republic, and in that regard thought-*
ful persons will agree with him. "
When we have formed such a public sentiment
throughout America in favor of right ideals of conduct
in private business and in public j. flairs we shall have
at last established securely social welfare and demo
cratic government, In that connection/ President
Hadley defined the essential mark of a gentleman as
"a readiness to subordinate a man's own convenience
and desires to a social code," and he went on to say:
"The code may be a good one or a bad one, but it is
an authority which the gentleman accepts of his own
free will, without waiting for any one to compel him
to accept it. To the extent that he does this he not
only proves himself a gentleman, but proves himself
capable of self-gevernment."
We have here a high ideal of public sentiment. The
phrase means, according to President Hadley, not that
which a majority is willing to talk for and vote for,
but that which the" community, or at least the domi
nant portion of it, lives up to in very deed. As an.
illustration of the power of that kind of sentiment he
cites the case of the student body at West Point,
among whom there his developed a social code more
potent than the regulations of the academy, the com
mands of officers and acts of Congress.
The failure of individualism in so many important
respects has naturally tended toward -the development
of a sentiment in favor of socialism, under the belief
that the evils of the present system can be cured by
state machinery. With socialism President Hadley
may have something of sympathy, but he does not
trust it as a panacea of the ills of society. He empha
sizes the truth that the' power of government to use
its machinery in the public interest "is in some
respects more apparent than real," and goes on to
say: "A democratic government is subject to special,
difficulties in exercising this power. It lacks the com
pelling force behind it which is felt in a monarchy or
an aristocracy â for what is everybody's business is
nobody's business, and laws which are passed with
enthusiasm often go rnenforced. It lacks continuity
of policy and tenacity of purpose. This difficulty is
seen when we compare our own foreign policy with
that of a country like Russia."
We Americans are living nominally under a govern
ment by law, but really under a government by public
opinion, and the speaker pointed out that the abiding
opinion'of the majority is not always expressed at the
polls. The vote, as he said, "may be simply the out
come of a widespread personal interest and may riot
deserve in any sense the name of public sentiment or
public spirit. Take the whole matter of anti-trust
legislation. Most people object to trusts. Why?
Largely because they do not own them. If a man
really believes that a trust is a bad thing and would
refuse to countenance its pursuits if he "were given .1
majority interest in its stock he can fairly dignify his
spirit of opposition to trusts by the title public
sentiment."
The orator began by pointing out that of the two
ideals of popular government â individualism and so
cialismâneither in itself is satisfactory. The individu
alistic theory has been tried for a time sufficiently long
and with a scope sufficiently ample to afford a thor
ough test of its merits, but the results have, not been
whojly satisfactory. It has been proven, as President
Hadley said, that "self-interest has done a great deal
for us, but it will not do everything. It is a powerful
stimulant to good, but neither in economics nor in
morals is it that panacea for social ills which so many
persons two generations ago thought it to be."
PRESIDENT HADLEY'S ADDRESS.
jâx RESIDENT HADLEY'S charter day address
I /at Berkeley was severely academic in tone and
thought, as befitted the occasion and the
audience. It was mainiy a criticism directed to a con
sideration of democratic government and of the re
lations between law arid public opinion. There was
nqthing in it upon \vhich any partisan can lay hold as
an argument for his party, but very much in it upon
which all citizens ought to lay hold as a matter" of
value to themselves and to society.

The lady remained in the Philippines a
year, meeting her sailor lover quite fre
quently as the Sherman made many
trips. She finally returned to San Fran
cisco and it was arranged that she was
to become Mrs. Hawes as soon as promo
tion came to her lover. On the last voy
age of the Sherman Captain Grant was
transferred to another, vessel. Captain
Hawes was given command, ana the quiet
wedding at San Jose resulted, y
Mrs. Hawes that is in the meantime
entered tho service of the Government
as a nurse, and as fate would have it wUs
ordered to Manila.- Fate was again kind
and decreed that she should sail on the
Sherman, and she again met . her old
friend. During the voyage to Manila the
friendship was renewed and ripened into
love. When she left the vessel at Manila
she was the promised wife of the gallant
sailor.
The courtship of Captain Hawes pos
sesses a tinge of romance. He first met
the lady who is now his wife while on a
visit to St. Paul. A strong friendship
sprang up between the two, which was in
terrupted by the captain's return to San
Francisco to resume his" duties as acting
master in the transport service.

were much together, and their regard for
each other was a matter of common

personally, in the development of the
town. How far Mr. Gilbert's business af
fairs were affected by Johnson's opera

that Institution's condition can disclose.
Mr. Gilbert, aside from his own" posses
sions, held many estates in trust, acted
as guardian in several instances and acted
as loan agent for considerable Eastern

Addition and avail themselves of the op
portunity presented by the absence of
families from the city to loot their
houses. â¢
Last Wednesday night a report was
made to the police that the residence of
Mrs. Dean had been broken into. The
thieves pried open a window in the rear
and made a complete search of the base
ment. The family was visiting In tne
country at the time and most of the In
terior doors were locked. One of the ser
vants was awakened by a noise as an
attempt was being made to force the lock
on a door leading to the first floor, and
screamed. This caused tho burglars to
run away.
On the following night the residence of
Rev.- Koute, in the adjoining block, was
entered. As in the case of the previous
crime the owner of the house was absent
from the city. The burglars entered a
number of rooms and carried away val
uables to the extent of about $500. The
silverware "and Jewelry was sought, but
was not located.
The police are_ anxious to capture bur
glars who entered the residences of Mrs.
Walter Dean at 1815 Gough street and
the Rev. Dr. R. C. Foute at 1915 Gough
street last week. The crimes were com
mitted on successive nights and while
servants were asleep in the houses.
Homes of Mrs. Walter Dean
and Dr. Foute Are
Entered.

The St. Patrick's day convention met
in KnJghts of Red Branch Hall yesterday
afternoon and received reports -from the
sub-committees appointed to arrange the
details for the last celebration. The work
of the several committees was heartily
indorsed, for the afternoon and evening
programmes presented at Central Thea
ter and the Mechanics' Pavilion received
a hearty response from the public. Whilo
it is not known exactly what amount was
realized by the -entertainments, it is be
lieved that fully JttK) will be turned over to
library fund of the Ancient Order of Hi
bernians.
A vote of thanks was extended to the
press. President O'Gara. the executive
committee, P. J. Kelleher and Frank S.
Drady for the services rendered by them
toward making the celebration a success.
After a long and acrimonious debate it
was decided to Increase by four the num
ber of trustees who now have under their
control the funds from the celebration of
1S96. The money raised by the St. Pat
rick's day celebration in that year,
amounting to about J1000, was voted to
the Irish society that should first be in
a position to erect a mil to be dedicated
to the Celtic" Association. .The, fund still
remains intact, as none of the societies
haa yet been able to fulfill the condi
tions that would cause the money to re
vert to it. The new members elected as
trustees of this trust fund are J. J. Dona
hue, Eustace Cullinan, Richard J. Klein
and John Heenan.

Kirwan and a friend started out to see
the sights on the Barbary Coast Saturday
night, and along toward midnight Kirwan
observed that a young man. who looked
like a "dope fiend."- was following- them
from place to place. Shortly before 2
o'clock Kirwan and his friend left a sa
loon on Pacific street, near Sansome, and
the stranger who had been following them
stopped Kirwan and ordered him to throw
up his hands. Kirwan grappled with him
and managed to throw him on his back on
the street. The stranger then pulled a re
volver and fired a shot at Kirwan. The
bullet grazed the top of his scalp. Kir
wan was stunned for a moment and the
robber succeeded !n getting on his feet
and making his escape.
Policeman Skain heard the shot and
upon appearing on the scene saw Kirwan
In a semi-intoxicated condition. Kirwan
tried to explain to him that a man had
fired a shot at him, but Skaln apparently
did not believe him and locked him up on
a charge of drunkenness. Kirwan v was
released yesterday morning by Judge
Fritz and made a complaint at police
headquarters of the attempt to rob him.
He gave a description of the man, but
there is little chance of linding him. The
cavalryman Â¦went to a physician on Kear
ny street and had the wound on his scalp
attended to. If the bullet had' struck a
half-inch lower Kirwan would not have
been able to tell how it all happened.
James" Kirwan, a private in Company G,
Fifteenth Cavalry, came near being the
victim of a footpad's pistol early yester
day morning. Instead he was arrested by
Policeman Skuin and booked at the City
Prison on a charge' of intoxication.

COMMANDER TILLET naval Gov- '

Islander aboard the auxiliary
cruiser Abarenda that he is anx
ious to get rid of. He cannot be
put ashore, as the Pago Pagoans would
kill him and he cannot be deported, as
there Is practically no trade between
Samoa and the Solomon group. The man
Is a confessed cannibal and In conse
quence the Germans will not allow him to
land In. their possessions, while the
Fijians do not want him at any price.
When the Samoa was In Pago Pago har
bor a few weeks ago Captain Tllley
Wanted to sh;jÂ» his man home via San
Krancisco. but the crew and passengers
objected to Mr. Cannibal and he Is still
aboard the Abarenda.
"It looks to me as though the native,
would have to come to California on the
Abarenda. when that vessel comes home

of the Sonoma yesterday. . "He Is a well

His nose Is tilt, a big rent has been torn

. The University of California slngle.s try
out was commenced last Friday after
noon. The tournament is a round-robin
affair, in which each player meets every
other player, and the two -men with | the
highest averages get the coveted places.
Two matches were played on Friday, in
which Paul Selby defeated both Drum
morid. McGavm and Baker. The match
between Selby and McGavIn was extreme^
ly close and required the full- five sets to
settle the question of supremacy. The fact
that the loser won one more game, than
his opponent shows how evenly the con
testants were matched. Selby disposed of
Baker in rather easy fashion. : â¢
Six men are entered in the tournament
âPaul Selby, Drummond McGavin, Reu
ben Hunt, Fred -Brown, Diebert and
Baker being the contestants. * The round
robin will be finished this week. . <

TENNIS MATCHES ON
MANY BAY COURTS
P. J. REILLY'S "Warship won first
prize in the lOS-dog open stake
yesterday at Union Park, beat-
O ing. Â£>â¢ J. Healey's Sisquoc in
the deciding course of. the
event. Warship is well known as a dan
gerous factor in the fastest kind of com
pany, that Is, when he is in "just the
trim." Not quite up to his standard of
condition Warship Is also noted for burn
ing up good money by his listless. work at
critical times. But â¢ yesterday the grreat
hound was on. edge. /
It has been some time since Warship
has had his name spoken | in whispers
as the predicted winner of a stake and
at no time of late has his name been
wiped off the board because of a too , heavy
play on him. in the long-odds book.; The
excellent showing made on Saturday by
the hound' was .overlooked a3 a conse
quence and even to the last his price -was
the short figure.
Governor Mac, the youngster who won
on the 10 to 1 short end in the run down,
was Warship's first opponent and an easy
victim. Then the fast Erin, quoted a 2 to
1 favorite, was disposed of by a score of
4 to 2, and Master Workman met the
same late in the next round by the same
score. Flying Fox sold 2 to 1 over Reil
ly's dog, but failed to get a point, and
Santonin at the same price was put away
in the semi-final.
This left Sisquoc, who has figured per
sistently of late as Warship's only oppo
nent. The Petaluma courser was made a
5 to 1 favorite, though the dogs had an
equal amount of work to- the second." Jhe
score was 2 to 2 when- the kill was made
and the dogs were sent,back to the slips.

old Bay District track, wanderers from
Colonel Pate's ill-timed Mexican venture.
Among their horses was a sprinter called
Guard and one bright afternoon he
etepped off five furlongs in 1:00 flat. There
were some queer yarns told about the
"tack" the rider of Guard carried on this
particular occasion, but it matters not
now. The horse ran like "something from
the o-l-d world," and a compound frac
ture was placed in the betting ring.
Stover, it is claimed, has never lost a
match race, and Kenilworth, on his train
er's reputation alone, will undoubtedly
go to the post favorite over Yellowtail.
Denver will give a great trotting and

The San Rafael Club put a strong force
in' the field. Tho score stood: Courthouse
8, San Rafael Club 3.
SAN RAFAEL, March 21.â Never in the
local baseball history was a more exciting
game played than the one to-day. The
courthouse nine, composed of officials and
ex-officials of the county, met and van
quished the players of the San Rafael
Athletic Club. Sheriff Taylor led the
courthouse host to victory. County Re
corder E. J. Connell also distinguished
himself. He stole two bags, and got to
first once by stopping a "high "un" with
his ribs. Game Warden Robinson, who,
was the courthouse shortstop, sometimes
Â¦wished he had a pair of tongs to gather
in the hot ones. Ex-District Attorney E.
B. Martinelli played out in the right field
and enjoyed a. peaceful nap. In the sec
ond inning he made a heme run, and the
way he rolled around the bases drove the
assemblage wild.

ton was at Dumbarton yesterday making;
arrangements to launch Shamrock II, and
the ceremony has been definitely fixed for
April 20. The Marchioness of Duflerln
will christen the yacnt.
The attempts last week to dredge the
channel deep enough to float the chal
lenger failed, owing to the shifty nature
of the bottom. For a time it looked as If.
this might give rise to serious difficulties,
because the long fin and heavy ballast de
mand twenty feet of water, which It |3
impossible to get. In this dilemma Mr.
Watson devised an ingenious plan. This
Involves a huge water-tight box of suf
ficient buoyancy to carry the whole
weight of the yacht. The box is being
built around her underbody in such fash
ion that the whole of the hollow between
the body of the yacht and the fin will be
filled up. It is calculated that thla will
float Bix feet above the normal water line
of the yacht, and that when deep water id
reached It can be knocked away.
One result of the use of the contrivance
will 'be that the underbody will be hidden
as the yacht goes down the ways, and It
will be impossible to get a complete pho
tograph of her.

Yesterday ths bridse leadlssr to the la
?oon at' ' Tiburon was raised and tha
yachts that had spent the winter therS
passed out Into the cove to their summer
moorings, where they will remain for tbÂ«
next six months. Usually tho bridge has
been raised as soon as possible after ths
arrival of the 11 a. m. ferry boat from tns
city, but. owing to the state of tha tide,
it was not found practicable yesterday to
raise it until 2:30 p. m. When the team
of horses was hitched on to the tack!*
the draw came up slowly, unwillingly ar.l
creakingly, but without mishap. Tne first
yacht to be towed from winter quarter.*
Into the cove was the sloop Ella; next
came the Wawona, which struck against
the bridge on her port side, but vas soon
cleared.
The little sloop Surprise of the San
Francisco Yacht Club was not so fortuj
nate, for a wire stay on the starboaru
ride, fouling one of the bolts of the draw,
her spreader was carried away on one
side and her topmast was snapped, it be
ing impossible to check her headway
quickly. The sloop fell back and made
room for- others to pass through. The
yachts were towed out In the following
order: Sloops Mischief. Freda. Aeolus.
Presto, Halcyon, Merope, Surprise, Edna.
Rambler. Emma, Josie. Truant, >Iay.
Cupid, Amlgo, Rover, Thetis. Juanlta and
Clara. The launches A. C. McNelll. Nor
wood and Crescie were on hand, and
rendered valuable services.
Commodore W. N. McCarthy of the San
Francisco Yacht Club came over from
Sausallto In the launch Gazelle, Port Cap
tain James Kitterman had a large- party
in the launch America, and Dr, T. I* HP1
sailed over to Tiburon In the b1ooj> Cys
nus. The launch America towed tho
sloops Thetis, Juanlta and Surprise to
their moorings at Sausallto. After tho
yachts had left the lagoon three "Or four
of the arks were towed out, among then
being La Fiesta and La Boheme.
The Corinthian yachts Harpoon and
Spray are at Sausalito, beintr fitted out
for the season. The yawl Phyllis of the
San Francisco Yacht Club has been lyin?
In Napa Creek during the winter, but
Â¦will shortly return to her Sausalito moor
ings. The San Francisco sloop Ntxlo and
the Corinthian sloop Sappho are on Swan
son's way*, the former covered snugly
with canvas.

As soon as word reached the young

his home. Instructions were sent here to
have the remains prepared and shipped
there at once. Ferguson's friends and
school companions in Oakland are anx
ious to show respect for thei â¢ dead col
lege-mate, so funeral services- will be
.held to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock at
the First Methodist Church. Rev. Paul
M. Spencer, the assistant pastor, will of
ficiate. The faculty and students of the
Polytechnic Business Col'ege. which Fer
guson was attending, will attend the ser
vices in a body. The remains will be sent
to Poplar after the ceremonies.
"It was not more than a minute before
the diver of the baths was on hand," said
George Copman, one of Ferguson's com
panions, "and . he had the body out of
the water in a remarkably short space of
time. The doctors hurried to Ferguson
and tried to resuscitate but to â¢ no
purpose.
"It was a terrible, shock to all of us, 1
this distressing accident. I could not real
ize that it had occurred. We had "been in
the water about fifteen minutes and there
was not any warning save the cry of the
young man to be taken out of the water
But we thought it was only a 'josh' and
not until he disappeared did we . imagine
anything serious had occurred. Ferguson
was, like the rest of us, only an ordinary
swimmer." .
The circumstances attending young Fer
guson's death were peculiarly unfortunate.
His cries for assistance while he was in
the big tank were unheeded by his com
panions because they supposed he waj
only Joking with them. It was not until
he sank out of sight that the alarm waa
given. None of the young men who ha-3
gone to the baths with Ferguson were
expert swimmers and could not assist
him.
OAKLAND, March 24.â Coroner Mehr

conclusion that James Ferguson, the
young student who lost his life last night
at Piedmont Baths, was drowned after
Einkmg from a sudden cramp or exhaus
tion.. The physicians who were on j the
scene immediately afier the body was
brought out of the tank by Diver Henry
Stephenson say there was ample external
evidence to show that the young man was
asphyxiated. Upon this showing there
will be no autopsy held, but the Coroner
has ordered an inquest .for to-morrow

racy cf this report. They believe, however,
that, in view of Father Martin's bad state
of health, an assistant may be appointed,
with every likelihood of succeeding him
eventually.
"If any action had already been taken
by the Holy Father." said the Rev. Father
... â¢ vnne - S. J.. to a Call correspondent,
"it would have be*n reported to us by
cable by our representative In Rome,
Father Meyer. No message on this sub
joct has. however, been received. On the
other hand there is a possibility that a
vicar has been or mav be appointed as an
assistant to Father Martin, who will take
cnerpe of his work. " The general has been

ne -is comparatively a young manâ about
M years oldâ and has sVveral assistants
and advisers, who have charge of differ

Under the circumstances I think it !s
probable that the Holy Father has given

MARSEILLES. March 24.-The proposed
arbitration of tho differences Involved in
the' strikes has led to a general relaxation
in the situation. The measures of the po
lice are now less strict. All the troops
have been removed from the streets and
other public places, although retained un
der arms in barracks.
This morning the street cars began run
ning intermittently, and a regular service
on all lines is 'promised.'
The strike of the bakers has not proven
serious. Bread was delivered to all cus
tomers to-day. The general situation la
one o( calm. The third-class cruisers
Llnois, Galilee and Lakoiaier. with the
torpedo-boat destroyer Duiiois, have ar
rived from Toulon to assist In preserving
order." . ;
Quiet Is Restored in Marseilles and
Troops Are Removed From Â»'
the Streets.
ARBITBATION PBOJECT
. PUTS END TO . RIOTING
"There is "a feeling" among manufactur
ers," says the Cologne Gazette, "that
American makers, through the trust, will
flood the European market- with machine
tools, and therefore German makers will
ask for increased "protection."
The pig iron product during. February
was C24,20S tons, or a decrease of 4400 tons.
The coal syndicate has decided not to re
strict-the output. .These facts made iron
and coal shares- unusually strong yester
day, the Week's advance ranging from
five to ten noints.
Fear American Competition.
American railways were unusually ac
tive. This: was also the case with Cana
dians. But Americans weakened yester
day, responding to New York. The Amer
ican iron reports exerciÂ«ed a strong , in
fluence upon the German boerses. giving
unusual strength and also inspiring a hope
that' the German iron trade had turned
the corner. Some Iron men expressed the
opinion that the worst has passed. Ger
man wire makers having large New York
orders are planning to raise 'the price of
pig iron. The association of German tool
makers has been in i conference at Co
logne against American competition.
BERLIN. March 24.â It is significant
that unfavorable factors, like the break
ing off of negotiations . between Lord
Kitchener and General Botha and the An
gle-Russian disagreement, failed to affect
the Berlin Boerse â¢ seriously last week.-
The latterlhalf of the week brought a
firm tone, I particularly yesterday. .The
feeling prevails that the Boerse is enter
ing into a period of greater strength.
The Improved tone of the iron market is
largely responsible for - this. Moreover,
the money market is expected to become
easier in April. Indeed speculators gen
erally regard the business situation as
more hopeful. 'The announcement of an
imperial loan has -not Â¦ seriously affected
the quotation of imperial threes, the first
fall having been partly recovered. The
fall for the week was only 30 pfennings
and that in Prussian consols only 10 pfen
nings. A number of small municipal loans
were announced during the week for early
subscription. - . .
Boerse Gains Strength.
The American section monopolized the
business of the week. Quotations again
advanced all along the' liney* in sfclte of
heavy realizations. The strength of -the
market was mainly due to New York buy
ing. JÂ£rle shares were the most Interest
ing feature, Erie common rising for the
week live points. Louisville and Santa
Fe were also in considerable demand. The
market closed strong with some excep
tional risesâ Denver and Rio urande 2%,
Wabash common 2V*. Wabash debentures
1%, Pennsylvania 1, New York Central 1
and New York, Ontario and Western Â»$.
Erie, however, fell away one-half of a
point at the close, while some others were
fractionally lower. Money was in sharp
demand; until Monday at 4@4% per cent;
for a week, 3%; three months' bllls^ft
per cent.
LONDON,. March. 24.â The disappoint
ment" caused by the refusal of General
Botha to accept the conditions proposed
by Lord Kitchener, uponivhlch the Stock
Exchange had counted almost with cer
tainty, had a bad effect on consols and
kafflrs. last week, while the Anglo-Rus ;
sian conflict at Tientsin was. another po
tent element of weakness. The apparent
removal of the dangerous features of tho
Tientsin Incident led to some recovery In
prices, but business was again checked
by another settlement In sight. Consols
fell to 95%, the lowest figure since 1802,
and in spite of a recovery' to 96^4 they
continued weak, the marKet closing at
American Bailroads Brisk, With Â£ome
Exceptional Rises, and Close With
, Good Demandâ Berlin Iron â¢
{ Market Improves.
BOTHA'S REFUSAL
LOWERS PRICES

JIBS. HAMMOND BEMEMBERS
' ASSOCIATED CHABITIES
Gives Her Check for Three- Hundred
Dollars to Treasurer
S. W. IÂ«evy.' .''.
Mrs. John Hays^ Hammond yesterday
gave her check for W0 to S. W. Levy,' to
be used in the interest of the Associated
Charities. The gift was totally unexpect
ed and filled the philanthropist- with a
great joy.
Mr Levy and Mrs. Hammond were as
sociated in associated charity work many
years ago. and In recalling old times
Â¦Mr Levy mentioned the fact that for the
first time since organizing the Associated
Charities had been obliged to appeal to
the public _ ' -Â¦ ' .
"Let me rive you $200 for your pet char
ity " said Mrs. Hammond, and while Mr.
Levy was pouring out his thanks the lady
stepped over to. her desk and wrote out
â¢â¢I have changed my mind." said Mrs.
Hammond, handing the old gentleman her
check; "I have made it out for $300 in
stead of $200. I think you can find use

usefully, for the exchequer of the-Asso
ciated Charities at present is at a very
low ebb.
what, they have caused us to suffer be
cause they are blind to the truth and
know no better."
Dr. Dickey In conclusion told of the
steady growth of the Presbyterian
Church. "One hundred years ago," said
he, "It had less than one hundred min
isters; to-day it has 8000 preaching the
gospel of truth." â¢ Â¦
The ' prayer of benediction was said by
the Rev. James W. Woodworth, and the
audience dispersed after singing "God
Bless Our. Native Land."

pastors of this city for the good work
they have accomplished and performed
for the church we all love." .
Dr. Dickey then paid high tribute to
California, saying, that â¢ Its snowclad
mountains and fertile valleys reminded
him more forcibly than anything he had
ever seen before of "the kingdom of Jesus
Christ." He next spoke of the celebration
to be held in May, when object lessons
will be given of the work accomplished
by the Presbyterian Church. After brief
ly touching on the matter of the church

LARGE AUDIENCE IN METROPOLITAN HALL LISTENS TO REV. C. A.
DICKEY, MODERATOR OF THE PRESBYTERIAN' CHURCH. TALK
OF PROGRESS MADE IN RELIGIOUS WORK. .
pÂ»rp^HE Rev. C. A. Dickey, D. D., mod-
I . erator of the General Assembly of
I the Presbyterian Church, and who
\X. is making a tour of the United
States, was listened to with inter
est last night by an audience that filled
every seat In Metropolitan Hall. Even
ing services were not held In any of the
local Presbyterian churches, in order that
the members of the several congregations
might have an opportunity of hearing Dr.
Dickey, who is acknowledged to be one
of the foremost speakers of the time on
matters pertaining to that religious be
lief. He is an earnest lecturer, and from
the moment of his introduction until he
concluded his remarks he carried with
him the attention and interest of his
listeners. '
The services last night, which were of
the nature of a mass meeting, were
opened with an invocation by the Rev.
J. S. Thomas and a brief scripture lesson
by Rev. W. K. Guthrie. After the sing
ing of an appropriate hymn by a selected
choir, the Kev. E. H. Avery offered up a
prayer and then introduced Dr. Dickey.
"It seems almost unnecessary," said Dr.
Avery. "to introduce Dr. Dickey, for he
is well known to you all by reputation, if
not personally. He is an earnest ex
pounder of the doctrines of our faith and
is engaged in a crusade far holler than
the crusade of Peter the Hermit. He is
telling the people of this land that their
gifts and prayers will go far toward de
termining the character of the new cen
tury we have Just entered into. His of
fice is as high if not higher than that of
any bishop in the Â¦world." Â¦
"I hardly have breath left in me," said
Dr. Dickey, "to speak to such an audi
ence, for you have almost taken It away
by your hearty welcome. I desire, how
ever.'ito express to you my profound grat
itude," not alone for the expression of re
spect shewn me. but also for the church
I am for a brief time to represent. I also
wish to congratulate the Presbyterian
president of the Risdon Iron and Locomo
tive Works.
"Rumors that a general strike of ma
chinists was contemplated during the
month of May." said Captain Taylor,
"have reached us. Just what form the
demands will take I do not know. Some
say that the 1st of May has been select
ed" as the date, and others fix" the 20th as
the day. So far only rumors of an im
pending strike have reached us.
"No official communication has come
from any organized body of machinists,
so what they may demand in the % way of
increased pay or shorter hours I cannot
say. AsHo whether the movement will
start in the East and spread to San Fran
cisco or start here and gather in every
machine' shop and manufacturing plant
In the United States we are in doubt. In
fact, all I can say is that the rumors are
persistent, and the threatened demand is
a subject for very earnest consideration
among the employers of this class of
labor."
At labor headquarters but little was
known regarding the strike inaugurated
Saturday at the Union Iron -Works. The
men who went out, it is said, recently
formed a union which does not affiliate
with the Building Trades Council. It is
a member, however, of the international
federation. The machinists have a strong
union in this city which meets on the
first and third Wednesday of each monUi
The last meeting was held. on March 20.
The action taken at that time has not yet
been made public But as the date fixed
by Mr. Scott is Just sixty days from- the
date of the last meeting, it is not Im
probable that the interim is to be utilized
In preparing for the struggle that Is to
come. :.".'-- Â¦
Asks Believers in the Creed to Open Gentury by Freeing
the Church From AH Debt.
Apparently the strike of the fitters-up
of the Union Iron Works Is but a pre
lude to a greater one which, according
to resolutions recently adopted, is sched
uled for May 20. The machinists have
Fignified their intention to demand on
that date a decfease In hours of labor
from ten to nine and an increase in pay
cf JTU j>er cent. The strike may become
general and extend to every shop in the
city and State where the machinists are
employed. It may go even further and
extend throughout the United States.
Officials of the Union Iron Works have
been expecting the strike of the fltters
vp for some time and did not express
surprise when some sixty men laid down
their tools at noon on Saturday. No
written demand has yet been filed with
the company, and it was not until 4
o'clock that afternoon that the main
office was apprised of the walkout.
"Prosperity brings its troubles alike to
the manufacturer and the workingman,"
said Irving M. Scott at his residence yes
terday. "We are laboring here under
conditions which will not permit us to
practically advance the pay of these
strikers 10 per cent. We are Soing ousi
ness on a margin of 5 per cent, and In
consequence cannot consent to such an
increase.
â¢I have all along told our employes,
who can work here CC3 days in the year,
that if wages are first advanced in the
Kastern Stales, so that the same relative
margin of profit may be maintained, we
will meet any just demands for an in
crease. The machinists have notified us
that on and after May a) they will de
mand an Increas-e or one-eighth In pay.
and a decrease of l'J per cent in worKing
hours. I have centered all the energies
of my life in bringing the Union Iron
Works up to the present state of effi
ciency, but to meet this demand will sim
!â¢!>â¢ mtan to close down the works until
ibe men tee the error of their ways."
"What effect will the present strike
have in relation to the launching of the
Ohio?" was asked Mr. Scott.
â¢The Ohio was ready for launching a
year ago." he replied, "but the failure
of Congress to settle the armor-plate
question has been the cause of tbe delay.
Oa all contracts we have a strike clause.
The present one, unless it reaches to
other branches of labor, will not seriously
inconvenience us.
"The threatened strike of the machin
ists is. however, a more serious problem.
The date is the Monday following the
launching of the Ohio. As Saturday. May
IS. will be a noiiday in the yards, it might
as well be said that it will go Into -iffect
on that date. I think if the machinists
here would wait until conditions were
changed and wages increased in the Kast
their demands could be more satisfactor
ily met and adjusted. Trade unionism
has ruined England, until to-day she is
compelled to send to the United States
for American productions, such as rail
way iron, steel bridges and other articles
of which at one time she had a manufac
turing monopoly.
"On the Continent wages are even
lewer. On the Eastern seaboard the work
figman cannot do Justice to his labor in
the cold of the winter, and must lay off
during the heat of summer. That means
loss of time and money. But here, under
ideal conditions of climate, permitting
him to labor all the year around, he gets
better wages and steady work. I trust
the difficulty may be bridged over, but
thÂ« demands are too exorbitant for con
gideration."
That there is a general feeling of unre-t
imong capitalists interested in work re
quiring skilled machinists is evident from
the remarks of Captan AV. H. Taylor.

with battery. He was " immediately re

resignation and will leave for her home in

.- Â« - ,
Many soldiers ran amuck on Barbary.
Coast last night, and a provost guard was
required to assist the police in quelling
riots. An attack was made upon the con
ductor of a Union-street car at
street, but the railway employe's daring
held an angry mob of thirty fighters back
until the arrival, of policemen. â¢ . â¢Â¦â¢
Early in' the evening several ; hundred
soldiers left the Presidio, and before many
hours many of them had consumed much
whisky served out in dance halls and
dives. They created trouble, and a pro
vost guard was at once sent out to order
every soldier in the city to report imme
diately at military headquarters. ; From
one particular location . a , crowd of thirty
disorderly men was "started in the direc
tion of : the ; Presidio. .Near the corner of
Dupont street arid Montgomery avenue
they boarded a street car and refused to
pay fare. Police were called and the'ob
stinate paBsengers.were ejected.
As quickly as the car started again the
soldiers followed and succeeded In catch
ing it again , near Stockton street. -They
forced 'the grlpinan to stop and then at
tempted to climb aboard the rear coach
for the. purpose of assaulting the con
ductor. When the latter saw them com
ing he placed his hand to his hip pocket
and declared that he would shoot the first
man who approached him. While he was
unarmed and his game only, a bluff, he
kept the mob at bay until Policemen
Bakulich and Wall arrived, and , with
drawn clubs permitted the car to proceed

DISCOURSES ON THE
TAKING AWAY OF SIN
Rev. A. H. Briggs Delivers Sermon
to Young Men at Y. M. C. A.
Auditorium.
The Rev. A. H. Briggs conducted the
services for young men yesterday after
noon at the Young Men's Christian .'Asso
ciation auditorium. After the, singing of
several hymns by the Knickerbocker
quartet. Dr. Briggs preached 'from the
text in a verse of one of St. John's
epistles "We know that he was manifest
ed to take away our sins."
"Some people are averse to acknowl
edging that there is sin in the world,"
said Dr. Brigga, "but that it does exist
is a 'cold- bare fact.- The smart set of
New York City was horrified when Dr.
Huntlngton and Dr. Hamilton called Its
attention to the fact that sin in its worst
form hovered m'its midst.' It worried the
members of the smart set,' but there -was
no â¢ gainsaying ; that* the evils were there.
While therefore we are agreed that there
is sin, we have it on' the authority of St.
John that the Savior was manifested to
wipe It out. It Is a tremendous truth, but
we should ; appreciate it, and if there is
any way of getting rid of sin- it is: well
worth knowing. The Lord points out the
way; and = you have but to follow him to
avoid^the pitfalls."
AWAIT j GOVERNOR'S ACTION
ON NATIONAL GUARD BILL
Young Men Enlisting to Enable
Them to Go to the Military
Camp.
The members of the National Guard are
anxiously awaiting the action of Governor
Gage in the matter of the amended Na
tional Guard law, wnich â¢ he received a
few days before the adjournment of the
Legislature. If he signs the hill it will,
it is asserted, arouse a spirit of enthus
iasm in the rank and file, and do much' to
make the guard the active body that the
citizens expect it should be; but, if he
pockets the bill, it *s more than likely that
the feeling that now prevails will be main
tained.
At this particular time there is, as on
all occasions when there is to be an en
campment of the guard, a little more ac
tivity. A number of young men who have
leisure and want to be soldiers for a lit
tle wmie, bo as. to ko into . camp for a
week, are Joining the companies, and
after the camp is over there will be a
number of .men discnarged from the ser
vice of the State on account of removal.
The division encampment that will be
established on June 22 at Santa Cruz and
continued for a week will be the largest
gathering of the guard at any one point
that has ever been known in the history
of the armea force of the State.
Twenty-eight men have been discharged
from the Fifth Infantryâ 21 on account of
removal, 4 at: expiration of term of ser
vice and 3 for the good of the service.
Corporal J. F. Johnson.. Company I,
Fifth Infantry. Â»>as at his own request

Private A. W. Gray has been appointed
corporal of Company A. Corporal B. A.
Wallman of Company I. has been pro
moted to sergeant, and Privates A.. L.
Young and- R. P. Aylward of the same
company have been appointed corporals.
. A meeting of representatives of five or
ganizations of business men of this city,
namely the San Francisco Board of
Trade, the- Chamber of Â¦Â« Commerce," the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, the Produce Exchange and the Mer
chants' Association, will be held this aft
ernoon in the rooms of the Board of
Trade. The ostensible business Is to name
a candidate' for the position of Harbor
Commissioner to" succeed Major Haxney,
whose term has expired, and to recom
mend' him to. the Governor for appoint
ment. The meeting has beeh kept very
quiet, and although there has been some
talk of . It among the knowing - ones for
several days,' .the meeting Is supposed to
be a secret affair.
There are . two views entertained con
cerning it by those who have been in
vited to be present. One view Is that .the
Governor has made, a very shrewd move
to have the business men recommend a
candidate whom he desires to appoint, and
at the same time to win the favor of the
business community of San Francisco by
taking the man whom they name. The
other view is that the idea arose sponta
neously In 'the Merchants'. Association,
where it was first heard of by -the busi
ness men, and that the Governor is still
ignorant of what is going on and there
fore has no agency in the meeting.
Several gentlemen who have been asked
to represent the bodies to' which they be
long, respectively, were seen yesterday,
but all professed not* to know that any
candidate had teen 'selected' for them' to
indorse. The names of Wakefleld Baker,
Isaac Upham and J. B. Stetson have been
mentioned as being acceptable to the busi
ness community. Baker has already de
clared that he is not a candidate. Stetson
Is the president of a. railroad company
and has favors to ask of the Harbor Com
mission. Possibly the choice of the meet
ing will not fall upon any of those named.
The very fact that the meeting has been
kept so quiet and that no one is openly
put forward for the indorsement is taken
by some to indicate that some one has the
name of the lucky man and will present
it at the proper time, and that if the man
named Is not objected to by the business
men at the meeting he will be recom
mended ta.the Governor. . .. '
There haVe been two executive sessions
of the directors of the Merchants' Asso
ciation at which the idea of recommending
some one to the Governor came up. The
directors have a practice of not saying
anything to any outsider of what is going
on in the privacy of executive sessions,
but it is known that there has been some
opposition to the plan of holding a meet
ing for the purpose described. One.di
rector said that even if a suitable candi
date should be brought into the field it
would be unwise for the association to be
come responsible in any degree for the
actions of any one in a political position.
At the second executive session of the di
rectors of the association it was voted to
call the meeting. Accordingly, invitations
went out late last week to the organiza
tions that have been named to send three
representatives | each to the conference.
The delegations may or may not include
the presidents of the respective bodies.
That is optional. Several declinations to
serve have been received, but it is sup
posed that all vacancies will be filled and
that fifteen business men will be in at
tendance this afternoon. They may not
recommend any man for the position of
Harbor Commissioner. Some of the dele
gates are reported to favor asking the
Governor to name a business man for the
position, but leaving the selection of the
individual entirely to him. The opinion
is stronger that a name will be recom
mended. Â¦ Â¦
