THE * President's wife, is on the
read to recovery and the intense
. alarm as to her. condition has
subsided. In the past forty-eight
hours Mrs. McKinley has gained
steadily .In' strength and present indica

when the chief executive may start for
the East .with his wife, although It is,
of course, impossible to set any day for
his departure, as everything depends on
his wife's health. During- the time that
the President remains in this- city he will

to make an amicable adjustment of the
situation, but.no results were reached. /-
Some Grant Demands:
It was reported during the evening~that
a number of shops had already granted
the demands of the'workingmen. -So far,
according to Secretary Wisler, there are
thirteen out of the 200 and odd places af
fected that are now unionized. These'
shops are. mainly what are called "small
ones." The granting of the demands made
upon them simply signifies that the pro
prietors wish to avert any loss.
Secretary Wlsler, who apparently has
sole charge of the machinists' strike, said
last night that he could give no estimate
of the number of men that were out.
About 1250 men employed as machinists
are bo far involved, but the number -of
men affiliated with the iron trades Is con*
jectural. The trades, concerned include
the machinists, iron molders, blacksmiths,
boiler makers, iron shipbuilders, patterp
makers, metal polishers, core makers,
steam fitters, machine jdrillers and ma
chine blacksmiths. In addition to these
are apprentices and helpers who cannot
go to work while the other iron working
departments are idle. \
Speaking of the situation last night
Secretary Wlsler ' said: "The men em
ployed in the'ir.on trades, with limited ex
ceptions, have walked out and will stay
out until their grievances are adjusted.
Committees representing each branch of
the trades met the employers in the
morning and a general refusal was made
to their demands."
At no place In the city was thero the
least disturbance. Through the courtesy
of Alex Greggains, headquarters have
been established at Sixth and Clara
streets, where they will meet day and
night. The main office will stlllbe main
tained at 025 Market street.
Employers Are Reticent.
The employers are all reticent regard
ing the situation of the various shops and
beyond the fact that . the wheels have
stopped and' everything Is at a standstill
they claim" to know little about the
strike. Nevertheless there have been
meetings of the iron men and there- is a
definite plan of campaign among them,
although no one will tell what that plan
is or will even admit that there is any.
In the Fulton Iron Works ." there are
nearly 1000 men out; in the Rlsdon
are 1100; in the Vulcan there are forty; in
the Hercules Engine Company there are
seventy-five; in the Electrical Supply
Company there are seventy-five, and soon
down the list of shops, all report from
ten to thousands of men all out and pre
paring for the struggle.
From the calmness of the employers It
Is evident they have been preparing for
the crisis. The men all came to work
yesterday morning as usual and just be
fore 9 o'clock committees waited upon the
head men. of each firm and asked whether
or not the demands of the union were to
be complied with. The answer In each
case was that they were not. and at- c-nce
the strike was on. The employers de
clare that they are willing to treat with
the men Individually but: they will not
recognize Â¦ the : unions. : That they - will
treat with the men individually, however,
does'not mean that they will accede to
demands similar to those - made by the
unions If the men individually prefer
them. â¢ .,-â¢ .
Eeport on the Street.
It was reported on the street yesterday,
afternoon tiiat the men of the Union Iron'
Works'had submitted a proposition to the
Scotts whlch. : was 'iin effect -that they
would recede on alf demands' If they were
allowed the nine-hour day without* reduc-
Under Instructions Mechanics Go to
Their Homes.
Estimates, vary as to the number 6f
men who went out on strike yesterday
morning. On the part of those who have,
authority to speak for the corporations,
the figure is fixed at about 3500. On the
other, side it is claimed that double that
number have struck. The branches of the
Iron trade Included in this general strike
are the International Brotherhood of
Boiler Makers and Iron Ship Builders, In
ternational Brotherhood of Blacksmiths,
International Association of Machinists,
iorn molders, core makers, pattern mak
ers, metal polishers, buffers, platers and
brass workers.
These comprise what is popularly known
as the Iron Trades Council. Acting under
the instructions of their representatives,
from every machine shop In the city the
men packed their tools early yesterday
and quietly went to their homes.
Out at the Union Iron Works, around
which eeems to center the brunt of the
disturbance, John Fitzpa trick, a gray
bearded mechanic who has seen many
years of service in the employ of that
company, after a conference lasting near-
Jy three-quarters of an hour with his em
ployers, went back to the shops and hold
ing up his hands exclaimed: , "Boys, it's
all off."
A Quiet Strike. Â¦
On Saturday Fitzpatrick presented Presi
dent McKinley with a gold plate on behalf
of the men employed in the j Union Iron
Works. He appeared yesterday in. a dif
ferent role. As spokesman 'for the men
he represented, he had a different tale to
tell.
Every man dropped his tools and walked
away to his home. No strike in this city
was ever inaugurated more -quietly. Fif
teen minutes after the strike was lnau :
gurated. there were but few men on the
street adjacent to the iron working estab
lishments. Determined but orderly, they
went to their homes.- later to meet at.-the
Turk-street Temple, where they spent' the
day discussing the various phases of the

These firms having conceded the de
mands, their men are at work as usual.
O'Connell said to-night that up to 5
o'clock reports show that 904 firms, em
ploying approximately 30,000 men, had
signed agreements for the nine-hour day
or' made satisfactory arrangements with
the local organizations.
The strike order, however, does not ap
ply to the railroads generally. It is ex
plained at headquarters that there is no
competition between the railroads and pri
vate work, and that work* among private
establishments is to be adjusted first.
The situation this afternoon was sum
marized by President O'Connell in the fol
lowing statement:
"We are demanding a nine-hour day
universally throughout the trade, with an
Increase of wages sufficient to overcome
the loss of the hour In time; regulation
of the apprenticeship system and the num
ber that shall be emploj-ed, in accordance
Â¦with the number of journeymen machin
ists employed; agreements as to arbitra
tion of all disputes that may arise in the
future; the right of the machinists to be
represented by a committee, arid agree
ments that there shall be absolutely no
discrimination against machinists because
of their membership in the union.
"From the present indications and the
statements issued from headquarters at
the various points, the orders axe being
generally obeyed and in larger numbers
than was anticipated. In certain cases,
where only a few hundred were expected
to be ln\'olved, the Indications are that
the number will be increased 50 per cent.
The number of firms signing indicates
that In the localities where the agree
ments are bdns made the strike will not
last over a few days.
"In other localities, where a larger num
ber of rren are being involved, I look for
ward to an adjustment being reached
within the present week."

What the Machinists Want
WASHINGTON. May 20.âAp
proximately 50.000 machinists
throughout the country struck
to-day for a nine-hour day. a
ecale of -wages equal to the present ten
hcur per day scale and other demands.
This is a rough estimate of President
O'Connell of the National Association of
M&chlr.Ists. based on telegraphic advices
tnat have reached him to-day from the
machinists* headquarters in various cities.
The strike thus: far has not extended to
the allied trades, cave In one or two in
stances, as at Scranton, Pa,, where men
In a part of the allied trades are out. No
machinists engaged in Government work
are aiTected. This is due to the fact that
en Euch work an eight-hour . day scale
already prevails. Railroad machinists, as
a rule, are not involved in the strike,
though the men on several roads are out.
The Central Vermont shop machinists at
St. Albans. numbering probably 200, havo
struck. The Lehigh Valley Railroad ma
chinists at Buffalo, Sayre, Wilkesbarre
and Elmlra are out, aggregating about 500
all told. The Delaware. Lackawanna and
Western men at Buffalo, Wilkesbarre,
Scranton and intermediate points are out.
The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe men are
a3so out.

THE STRIKE,
From the machine shops the men gath
ered at the Turk-street Temple and for
hours discussed the situation. No quieter
nor more orderly crowd of men could be
found. What grievances they have they
freely discussed. A conference committee

At the. Union Iron Works about 3100 men
struck out of a force of nearly 4000. The
Iron molders, core iri.ikcrs and others re
mained. . The molders are in sympathy
with the strike, but owing to' previous
complications cannot draw in their affil
iated bodies. Owing to the disastrous re
sults of the strike a few years ago, the
international governing body has forced
them to refer all these matters to their
organization before taking action.

night, delegations from each branch of
trade affected had a conference with their

POWER OF ;THE EUNUCHS.
WASHINGTON, May 20.â The War De
partment has received from China a peti
tion presented to General Chafftee. by a
mass meeting off several thousand ; of
Chinese, who assembled in 'front of the
â¢provost marshal. In Peking, -March 28
last, and signed by 6600, Chinese residents
of that city, praying the retention of the
American troops. The petition told of the
good work performed by the American
soldiers andof the thousands of homeless
people who had been fed by the American
charity houses. Captain John T. Tillson.
Fourteenth Infantry, the provost mar
shal, in replyingto the petition, said: .
"It Is needless to tell you that the.Unit-.
cd States does not maintain. an army for
the purpose of furnishing the , city of
Peking with good' municipal government,
arid as a business /proposition your appeal
for the United States , to remain
longer in Peklng'has little to stand upon.
"That you. will need our protection {.here
is little doubt and as the broader prin
ciples of humanity most frequently sway
the people of any r country, your petition
is not hopeless and I shall be glad to refer
It to our government. . ;
"Whatever the* result of your petition,'
whether. we stay or go;It may; be'gratify
ing to you to know;that the soldiers -of
the United States, ;who,. by force ' of -cir
cumstances, .came to China as your : en
emies, are now your 'friends and we hope
that this friendship may. endure."
WOULD RETAIN AMERICANS.
ST. PETERSBURG, -May 23.â The new
plan proposed by, England for the pay
ment of the Chinese indemnity has been
received here with $nuch mistrust,,princi
pally as necessitating an entirely new ex
change of notes "and thus involving fresh
delay3, whichx is just exactly what the
Russp-American policy seeks to. avoid. \ \
' A loan guaranteed by the powers would,
according to prevailing opinion here, have
the advantage of guaranteeing the Integ
rity of Chinese territory so long as the
loan lasted. â¢ '
Germany's desire to send a new expedi
tion against the Boxers is looked upon
here as suicidal to the prospects of 'peace.
The Bergevala Viedomosti, which af
fords a trustworthy reflection of public
opinion, comments as follows on the
Kaiser's speech regarding the confidence
of the Czar In Count Waldersee: "We do
not understand and we have no confidence
in- these penal piratical, expeditions, and
only understand peaceful methods. It has
needed much confidence In the triumph' of
common sense and in the 'triumph of. po
litical peace over the policy of adventures
and vagabondages for Russia to. remain
calm and cool during, these long months
of fruitless deliberations and criminal ex
peditions, complicating the situation
which should long ago have been eYided.
"If the' troops are being, withdrawn now
the powers are merely following the first
plan mapped out by Russia.,but In all this
wlysre is Russia's confidence in Count

gretting their inability to adhere to the
Russian' proposal 'for' an international
guarantee of the loan to be made by
China In the payment of the -indemnity
demanded by the powers, officials of the
administration cordially approve the sen'
tlments expressed by high Russian of
ficials quoted in the St. Petersburg dis
patch this morning.
Russia's policy throughout the Chinese
trouble has been practically identical
with that of the United States, and the
divergence on the subject of a loan, while
not affecting similar action on other ques
tions, is naturally not viewed with indif
ference here. A definite proposal that the
powers guarantee the Chinese loan has
not been submitted to this Government,
but it is known that the nations of Eu
rope believe that It would be trfe safest
solution of this feature of the Chinese
problem. '
The Government of the United States Is
not favorably inclined to the British pro
posal â that China issue bonds in favor of
each power to the amount* of Its indem
nity, and if that power chooses it can
guarantee the bonds. The authorities be
lieve that, so far as the United States is
concerned, no difficulty would be expe
rienced in floating bonds for the American
indemnity, ' which will be less than $25,

Different grades of punishment are rec

tion between subordination' and Insubor
dination the cadets may as well accept
the punishment that will be administered.

when he arose to speak, and it was some

began by reading telegrams and cable-
Message From th,e President.
As the closing strains of the "Hallelu
jah" chorus, played by the Seventy-first
Regiment Band, died away, Bishop Fow
ler offered the opening prayer.
The troops were massed on and around
the Bridge of Triumph and at 12:15 o'clock
the officials and special guests, headed by
Vice President Roosevelt and President
Milburn of the exposition, marched
through open ranks and on through the
roped enclosure to the Temple of Music.
The parade re-formed and marched on
through the grounds. After the entry of
the officials and guests, the Temple of
Music was thrown open to those holding
invitations and rapidly filled. Â¦ -
About noon the multitude began to en
ter on the esplanade about the Temple of
Music, where the exercises were held.
The first of the ceremonies on the grounds
was the flight of 10,000 homing pigeons.
The pigeons, suddenly released from cap
tivity, rose in a great mass, circling round
and round through the towers of the
buildings, rising higher and higher until
gradually, as they got their bearings, they
darted away, first in pairs, then by the
score, until all had disappeared to the
four points of the compass, bearing their
messages announcing the dedication of
the exDOBition.
The, parade moved oft at 10:10, a squad
of mounted police clearing the way. State
troops led, followed by United States ar
tillerymen. The Mexican contingent fol
lowed, end after them were more militia
men. Vice President (Roosevelt reviewed
the procession from a carriage at the en
trance of the City Hall driveway. When
the last of the military had passed Roose
velt was escorted to a carriage and rode
with President Milburn. Roosevelt was
cheered along the line and repeatedly
bowed his acknowledgments.

There are" certain truths which are so com
monplace as to be axiomatic, and yet so Im
portant that we cannot keep them too vividly
before our minds. The true welfare of the na
tion is lndlssolubly bound with the welfare of
the farmer and the wage worker, of the man
who tills the soil, and of the mechanic, the
handicraftsman, the laborer. If we can in
sure the prosperity of these two classes we
need not trouble ourselves about the prosperity
of the rest, for that will follow as a matter of
course. ' . - . * -

NEW YORK, May 20.â H. S. Devens,
eecretary of the National Metal Trades
Association, to-night expressed the opin
ion that the strike will not be a prolonged
affair, and said that he hoped to see the
settlement of the difficulty within a day
or two. Devens said further that there
.would be a meeting- at the Astor House
to-morrow of the manufacturers in- the
second district, which includes- the sec
tion covered by Greater New York. Mr.
Devens thinks it more than probable that
definite steps will be taken at that time
"for the solution of the existing trouble.'
He said further v that prior to a meeting
last Friday morning, held in this city,
several large manufacturers., who are
members of the National Metal Trades
WILL NOT BE PROLONGED.
The molders In all of the shops are or
ganized, but will not strike unless orders
are received from the international head
quarters. Should they walk out the Oak
land iron handling shops would be forced
to shut down.
"No plans have been formed concerning:
the future. I am not ready to say whether
non-union men will replace the mechanics
who have walked out Matters will prob
ably drift along for some time without
charge. We could not pay the waged
asked for by the men and continue in
business in the face of Eastern competi
tion.* We were already handicapped and
we could not stand the conditions. We
Khali operate our foundry as long as the
molders are willing to work."
Of the five machinist" at the Scoville
shops four are in the owners' family. The
fifth man went on strike. The union's de
mands were formally presented and the
firm formally declined to comply with
them. . - -
At the Oakland Iron Works thirty-two
rnachinis-ta. five pattern makers and four
appientlces went on strike. After Super
intendent George T. Randolph had in
formed the men that the company could
not yield, tbe mechanics quietly left the
ehepg. The works employed 145 men.
General Manager Booth made the fol
lowing statement:
At the Judson worka In Emeryville
twenty machinists, fifteen blacksmiths
and helpers and nine pattern, makers
withdrew after Superintendent McFeeley
had announced to their committee that
the nine-hour demand, would not be ac
ceded to by the management. The situa
tion was canvassed at conferences be
tween the men and the officials of the
works in a friendly attitude, the hope be
ing expressed that there would be a
speedy settlement/ of the difficulty.
The eight iron moldere and two core
makers employed at the works expected
to walk out to-day with their fellow
mechanics, but they cannot strike with
out direction from the central headquar
ters in the East, and that order they are
now awaiting.
Superintendent McFeeley and Assistant
General Manager Parsons would not dis
cuss the future plans of the company.
There are 300 men employed in the rolling
mill department who are not yet affected
by jlhe strike. Some of the striking me
chanics went to work in the rolling mills,
the understanding being that they would
not be asked to do machinists' work.
OAKLAND, May 20.â Upon the, refusal
of the managers of the Oakland Iron
Works, the Judson Iron Works and Sco
vllle'B Iron Works to yield to the nine
hour demand of their machinists, elghty-
Eix men walked out of the shops at 9:13
o'clock this morning in accordance with
orders from their international headquar
ter*. The strike was called in an orderly
way. There was no sign of trouble, the
men leaving the various shops and dis
persing without any demonstration. At
the Best works In San Leandro none of
the machinists went- out, although it was
stated by Manajer Flint that 6lx of his
machinist* were in the union. They are
paid 30 and 32V4 cents an hour for a ten
hour day.
Their Demands Refused, Many Ma
chinists Walk Out.
Last evening the striking mechanics de

union mechanics from accepting positions
that may be offered them.

ticn from the ten hours' pay. but accom
panying this report was another that the
works hart refused to consider the propo
sition. The same negotiations .were not
entered into with the other firms, at least
v.p to last evening. ; ,
It is the claim of the employers that the
business out here will not stand the strain
of a nine-hour day at the full schedule
of v.aces.*
It is pointed out that at the Union Iron
Works, with four thousand men working,
a cut of cne hour from every man's day
means a total cut pf 4003 hours a day, or
the equivalent of over 444 days of nine
hours. It was claimed by the men that a
man working continuously for nine hours
a day will do as much in the long run as
â¢1-man working ten hours a day. but the
employers point to the fact that most of
the men on strike are men who run ma
chines and that if the time for the run
ning of the machine is cut an hour a day
it means a full hour's work that cannot
be made up. for the machines are sup
posed to be working to their full capacity
all the time.
No one among the members of the firms
interested will hazard a guess as to the
probable length of the strike. It may last
for weeks and it may be settled in a few
<5a.ys. they say. The shops are all running'
full and there are a great many contracts
on hand, but all contracts are made with
a strike clause, and so- the firms willnot:
be liable for any delay the strike .-may
cxiiise. Their losses will be confined:, to'
the idleness of their plants and the Jack
of income by reason of the shuttingdown
cf all work. . " -
Cincinnati Plants Close.
CINCINNATI. Ohio, May 20.â At a meet
ing late this afternoon of the employing
machinists they decided to close down
'their plants indefinitely as a result of the
strike. A number of the larger firms de
clare they have enough finished product
on hand to tide them over a strike with
out inconvenience.
At a meeting of the. strikers to-night
Business Agent Harry Schilling of the
combined Machinists' Unions of this city
announced that the tie-up in Cincinnati Is
the most complete in the country. He
said there were but 100 non-union ma
chinists at work to-day, aside from the
600 who have been already conceded their
terms. These 100, he pledged, would not
work on Tuesday.
Samuel Gompers, president of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor, arrived early
to-day. Vice President. Thomas KIdd and
Treasurer John B. Lennon, members of
the executive board of the American Fed
eration of Labor, had preceded Mr. Gom
pers here. Early to-day they went into
conference with the local leaders of the
International, Association of Machinists.
An Increase Granted.
ALLIANCE. Ohio, May 20.â The Morgan
Engineering Works to-day granted its 500
employes, mostly machinists and molder3,
an increase in wages of 10 per cent. This
was the first strike in the history of the
company.
Many Return to Work,
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 20.â About 1200
machinists employed in this city went on
strike to-day. .
Of the 1200 men who quit work 500 have
been granted the increase and returned to
work. Business Apent Reynolds of the
Machinists'. Union declared to-night that
not more than 500 men are out now. .

TOLEDO. Ohio, May 2O.-This afternoon
and evening eleven firms signed the ma
chinists* scale, making a total of fifteen
firms which have granted the demands of
the workmen. There are yet about 100
men put, but it is believed that .within
two days all will be at work again. There
is a very friendly feeling between the
strikers and their employers.
On Strike at Scranton.
SCRANTON, Pa., May 20.â Every ma
chine shop in Scranton is idle to-day ow
ing to the strike for a nine-hour, day
and an increase of 12% per cent in wajjes.
Altogether 3000 men, quit work, and these,
with the Lackawanna machinists and car
shop men, out for a week past, make
nearly Â£000 on strike in Scranton. ;
The Dixon Works this morning posted a
notice agreeing to give nine hours a day
and to arbitrate the wage issue. The men
ignored the notice in obedience to inter
national instructions. Â¦ Â¦ \
Sixty Per Cent Go Out.
BOSTON, .May 20.â About 60 per cent of
the machinists employed in Boston Â¦'struck
to-day. The number of men involved is

Chicago Machine Manufacturers' Asso
ciation the members, adopted a reeolutlon
Indorsing arbitration as the means to set
tle the present strike difficulties in the
machinery and allied metal. trade3. As
over 75 per cent of the union machinists
employed throughout the city . have al

such a plan, there is little likelihood, of
any serious trouble among the machinists
in Chicago.

Association had conceded the demands of
the strikers. Devens also said:
"The machinists claim that about 3000
men are already 'out on strike. Perhaps
their figures are correct. I cannot say
definitely as to that. As to the extension
of the strike to allied trades I think there
is little likelihood of any such action be
ing taken. The matter will be settled in
an easier way than that."
- The chairman of the Machinists* Union
to-night gave out a statement in which
he says that over thirty firms, employing
over 1S(W ! men, had : conceded the de
mands of the strikers. He puts the num
ber of men who struck to-day at 7500 and
says the total number now on strike is
about 10,000. What is considered a fair
estimate of the number of local machin
ists out on strike at the various Brook
lyn establishments fixes the number at
about 1400.
CHETEXN'E, Wyo.. May 20.â Word was
received here .to-day from Lander that
several hundred Arapahoe braves. are de
fying Agent Nickerson of the Wind River
reservation and that an outbreak is
feared. The agent lias asked for permis
sion to use troops to suppress the rebel
lious reds. It is said that the Indians are
ia a bad humor because of the refusal of
the Government to issue seed grain and
permit them to holl their annual sun
clance.
Few crops have been put in and a large
number of Indians have been idle for
menths. Recently the Government .gave
instructions to issue rations but twice a
month instead of weekly, and the braves
claim they cannot live. Then a number of
hunting parties asked for permits to visit
neighboring reservations, and these
fjuests are said to have been denied. The
Shoshor.es have taken no part in the trou-
Me, but it is reported that the Arapahoes
have announced their intention of holding
their sun dance in spite of the agent -and
his troops. Complaints iiave been made
lately by settlers in the vicinity of the
reservation that thÂ« Indians have been
killing stock, and the whites are in bad
humor as a result. There is only a small
detachment of troops stationed at \v ash
akie. Should the Indians go on the war
path they could do considerable damage
on account of the insufficient force to
quell the disturbance.

HACHINSSTS' STRIKE IS BEGUN
ST. PETERSBURG. May 20.â Simon
James Gordon, the Russo-Ameriean who
was charged with changing his allegiance
without the Czar's permission, and who
was threatened with deportation to Si
beria, has been released under 2;,000
roubles, that amount having been depos
ited as security by his wife's relatives,.
He asserts his confidence that the case
against him will be allowed to lapse. He
is, as he states, winding up his old busl
i;css in order to go to the United States
and reinstate himself as a citizen of the
United States, the State Department hav
ing decided recently that according to
its rulings and practice he had prac
tically abandoned his rights.
Gordon' s rather left Riga early in the
sixties and was admitted to citizenship
in New York under the name of Jacob
Gcrdcn. October 23, 1868. He was for
mally released from Russian allegiance
October 20, 1S72. . Simon James Gordon,
who went to America with his father as
a minor, was naturalized November 26,
1872. He returned to Russia and was
married at the American legation in
March, 1874. On the advice of Eugene
Schuyler, American charge d'affaires,
i.e went to Riga, his father's old home,
and secured his release from military
enrollment upon production of proof that
he had been naturalized as an American
citizen. â ,
Two facts not without significance in
Gordon's/case are his marriage to a Rus
sian woman and his joining the ortho
dox church, which he did in order to pre

dorse the sentiment and declare that the duty

that it make the preservation, extension and

its paramount issues, as the best means of
counteracting the present powerful tendency to
the 'consolidation and centralization of power

Thirdâ We believe' that the Democratic party
should make the public ownership and control

the best means of freeing the people from the

Fourthâ In view of the industry and honesty

We repeat the purpose of the Democratic

Fifthâ The Democratic party has been de
feated but is not discouraged. If we are right,
we can afford to await the sober second
thought of the American people. It will come
when selfishness, greed and avarice have over
reached themselves, which they have never yet
failed to do in this world. When the waves
of passion and prejudice set in motion by the

about uniting the remainder. of their fam

U/ conference of the State League
of IroQUois Clubs, to which dele
)K.-^S gates from other Democratic
clubs of the State had been in
vited, assembled here to-day with few
more than a score In attendance. Tho
meeting gave ho signs of the long antici
pated revivification of the party in this
State. Its feebleness serving instead to
demonstrate further the party's decrepit
condition.
The meeting was held in the courtroom
of thÂ© Justice of the Peace, in the old
State Capitol. In an adjoining room the
youngsters of Benicia's juvenile band
"were giving an impromptu imitation of an
Indian show that is in town, and up. stairs
in the main hall something was occurring
that sounded like a Rip Van Winkle game
of nine-pins. In the conference Itself,
â¢when voices could be heard, it was gener
ally the tones of Clitus Barbour, Charles
Gildea or Walter Gallagher that were
soaring in spell-binding periods.
One thing alone gave the faithful cour
age and new hope. Fifty years ago, dur
ing the session of the first Democratic
State Convention, the # semi-centennial of
which was celebrated yesterday with so
much enthusiasm, it rained. To-day it
rained, and another long series of Demo
cratic victories is assured, say they.
Full ULst of Those Present.
The delegations present yesterday left
for the most part before night, and this
morning's conference, beginning at 10
o'clock, found the following present to de
cide the fate of the Democratic party in
California:

Â¦William Asmussen and Walter Gallagher of
Ban FranclEco; F. T. Gaven. Percy Douglas,
Assemblyman Arthur Williams and E. B. An
derson of Contra Costa County, and Herman
Hertzbrun of Benicia.
A list of accredited delegates, including
some hundreds ot names of eminent Dem
ocrats, was read, but those here given
were all who were in attendance.
The onlv revivification stunt that was
attempted was the election of Charles H.
Holcomb of fan Francisco as grand
sachem. The t-raves of the league look
to him to organize the Democrats of the
State into clubs and to unite the whole
into a harmonious, effective .machine.
Max Popper called the conference to or
der in the absence of Judge Cabanlss,
gTand sachem. After stating the object
of the meeting he said:
If the Republicans carry out their supposed
programme we believe that wÂ« can put a can
didate Into the field who can triumph over th^lr
nominee. We do not need reorganization, as
was plainly stated yesterday,, but strengthen
ing the present organization is what Is neces
sary. We have faced much more serious situ
ations than that which confronts us now and
have defeated our adversaries. All we need is
the active Interest of you all In organisation
around the present nucleus afforded by the
State League.

Benicia, May 20, 1901, again reaffirm* iu alle
giance to the principles of true Democracy, as
fvr.ress<?d In the platform adopted at Kansas
City. July *, 1200:
That the Democratic party requires no reor
ganization. A political organization that
I>olled 6.400,000 votes can Bately claim alle
giance to its faith and confidence In its lead
ers sufficient to warrant the organization to
proceed undisturbed to strengthen the recog
nized authority of the National Democratic
party, and we purpose to lend our aid to the
perfected organization to tne end that we may
achieve victories in the future, enlisting In our
ranks men imbued â¢with Democratic principles,
and we prefer that plutocrats, masquerading
as Democrats, ally themselves to the party
representative of accumulative wealth and
allied to the dominating trusts.
Resolved: Firstâ That we reaffirm the prin

The one defense against these enemies
is to keep the blood pure. Dr. Pierce's

pleted.
The committee met last evening in the
office of the secretary, J. C. Brickell, and
decided upon the turns and the placing of
the buoys of the course and the starting
rules. The course will be the same as
usual, but there will be several changes
In the rules governing the rounding of the
buoys. It has also been decided to shorten
the time within which yachts must cross
the line from ten minutes to five minutes,
and also to shorten the interval between
the starting of the classes from ten min
utes to nve minutes. , * _ 'â '
The start will as usual be from the foot

'.The big target by that time was practi
cally shattered and the marksmen settled
down in an effort to bring down the gal
lantblrd and attach the premier honors of
the day. Despite wind and clever shoot
ing the target refused to be dislodged
until with a well-aimed, and calculated
sight Doell carried off the palm and was
declared king of the Schuetzenfest. .> Â¦'...
' Seated on a- table surrounded by empty
beer kegs and miscellaneous glassware
the king was triumphantly borne to the
pavilion amid the noisy strains of a big
brass band. There he was to taste the
full glories of his feat.. A big bouquet of
roses made into the form of a huge yoke
was placed about his neck and while the
band played and his brethren cheered he
received aji*osculatory greeting from Miss
Edna Lamar that sounded like the echo
of a Mauser rifle from a Philippine jungle.
Miss Nora Garms performed the same ser
vice for Henry Utschig, the retiring king,
who. In turn received a floral gem as big
and knocked it into smithereens with- one
of the cleanest shots of the day. John
Tiedemann next secured the "apple" and
would doubtless have landed the king's
prize but for a sudden shift of the wind
which -moved the target. Henry Meyer
landed the "scepter" on his second at

OTTAWA. Ont., May 20.â The joint high
commission, representing this country
and the United , States, Is expected to re
sume its sittings during the present sum
mer. Sir "Wilfrid Laurler, the Premier,
in his speech on the British Columbia
Judges' bill to-day, alluded to the diffi
culty, of bring prisoners from Dawson
City across the strip of territory at
Skaguay claimed by the United States
and occupied by them under the terms of
a modus - vlvendl. Sir Wilfrid remarked
that this Question was one the high com
mission could deal with when it resumed
its sittings, as he hoped would be the
case in the course of the present summer.
Although â¢ nothing further official can be
obtained on the subject It Is likely that
the meeting will take place in the fall,
probably at Quebec. The Premier intends
to visit the-Paciflq Coast and the Yukon
shortly after the session and has made
engagements which will keep him going
for the next three months.

be weakened by the absence of two and
possibly three of its veteran players, who
up to this, time were expected to return
for the coming 1 season. . It â¢was learned
to-day that J. G. de "Forest, who for two
years played guard on the big eleven, will
probably not return to college in time to
take part in the annual game. He has
joined a surveying- party, which will de
tain him in Alaska till late next fall.
Carroll Seeley, right guard and the most
aggressive man in the cardinal .team last
fall, will leave colleere in a few days for
Sumatra, where he has accepted a perma
nent position.
The third player whom Stanford may
lose is Traeger, the giant tackle who wen
the game for the cardinal last year by
his neat place kick from the field. It
was announced a few days ago â¢ that he
would go. to Harvard next year, -but it Is
more than probable that he will return to
Stanford in the fall. If he does he is the

t^J YEN the driving rain, that con
]^ tinued throughout the day
" could not daunt the enthusiasm
' of the marksmen who assembled
yesterday at Shell Mound Park
to- participate in the second day's contests
of the annual prize shooting given by the
San Francisco Schuetzen Verein. It was
the forty-second celebration of the Ver
ein's May. festival. What the entertain-
rhent lacked in numbers when the rain
began to fall In torrents it quite made up
in \ fun - making and good - fellowship.
Weather conditions naturally had a de
cided effect on the scores, as a miniature
blizzard kept the wooden eagle on the
move for more than, three hours, and until
the final shot from a rifle in the hands of.
Kdward Doell, .who carried off the 'honors
of ; the day, . dislodged j the ; national bird
fromflts perch, the result ' was >, in doubt
and productive of the most intense rivalry
between the crack shots of the verein.
Early trains "carried the company of
shooters and their friends" from the mole
to Shell Mound Park.. After dancing had
occupied the throng for two hours the
shooting contest- began. . First among the
prize winners to score was Edward Goetze,
who drew a fine bead onjthe eagle's crown

The wind was fairly steady when they

fashion. On- the short run from the Nab
to the Warner lfghtship she gained more
than a couple of minutes and passed the
Warner leading by three minutes and

'} The course gave them a fair.' test in
beating to windward and reaching free.
For the purpose of testing the yachts
down the wind, booms were squared
away and spinnakers were set. for a fin
ishing trial before the wind from Â¦ the
Nab lightship, to Southampton water. The
Shamrock II continued to hold the lead
which she had gained over the triangular
â¢course. â¢ '
-When they next went about they were
still close together, but as they hove
about at different times there was a con
siderable gap. As they stood off again
In a northeasterly direction, at this time
half an hour from the start, the boats
appeared to be practically on the same
footing as when they started. â¢ Neither
had secured an appreciable advantage.-
Turning at the weather mark, the boats
started sheets and reached along the
wind for an island shore breeze. Soon af
ter they gybed around the Erin, still in
close company, but with the. Shamrock
II "leading. The booms went- over with
sheets well out for a broad and easy
reach for the line whence they started.
The challenger held her lead on this point
of sailing and was first to cross the line.
, Time at the Finish. ';
The first tack was to starboard and
they fetched along ten or fifteen minutes,
both lying equally close to the wind arid
apparently footing at about the same
speed. , The Shamrock I tacked . and the
challenger also came round under her
weather quarter. The challenger then
pulled up and the yachts fetched along,
beam for beam, in a long fast leg toward
the island shore. \ :-iV â¢ "
No Appreciable Advantage.
When the Erin gave the signal to start
the challenger, as usual, was kept a trifle
in hand. She followed the Shamrock , I
about three lengths astern, but a length
to the windward. In a fine, fresh breeze
the boats heeled well over to the press
of their enormous : sails, making great
progress.
. Sir Thomas Lipton's steam yacht Erin
towed the yachts clear of the Isle of
Wight and then both set their lower can
vas. The challenger's new crosscut main
sail, though hoisted ' for the i first j time,
seemed to set to perfection, better even
than the mainsail of Shamrock II.
RIDE, Isle of Wight. May 20.â The. two
Shamrocks raced to-day over an open sea
course, the first leg of which is 'a' beat
from Calshot Castle to a mark outside

The William Marston, launched last
Saturday, is now at Mission-street wharf,
where she will be masted and rigged. She
â¢will be one of the few five-masted
schooners on this coast, one of the others
being the Inca, now on Puget Sound, and
the other the old Louis, now in Willapa
harbor. The Marston is the larg-est ves
sel of her class ever built on this coast.
The steamship Horda 4 which struck an
Â¦uncharted rock in Oyster Harbor, reached
port yesterday. She will discharge and
go on the dry dock for inspection. Cap
tain E. H. Svendsen. in his report, says:
"We left Ladysmith at 5:10 a. m., May
35, and throe hours later struck three
times under the port bilge, listing the
vessel to starboard. We were running
full speed and passed over the obstruc
tion.
"When the Horda struck our bearings
were taken. We "had Ackland Island in
east one-half south, Channel Island east
southeast and the one-fathom patch buoy
three-quarter miles off in south three
quarters easi. showing from eig-hteen to
nineteen fathoms on the chart compiled
from the latest United States and British
surveys. At the time of the accident the
pilot, master and chief officer were on the
bridge."
Steamship Horda Was Damaged.
According to the news brought by the
America Maru shipping is having a hard
time of it in Oriental waters. The fine
new Peninsular and Oriental liner
Sobraon sailed from Shanghai on the* 3d
instant for London with a big list of
passengers but a small cargo. On the
morning of .May 4 she ran on Tajigyung
Island in a dense fog and will probably
be a total loss. The passengers were all
landed in safety, but as many of them
were missionary families, who had been
through all the horrors of the Boxer up
rising, the disaster was particularly hard
on tnem. The Sobraon was built last
year and was on her second voyage. She
vas 7240 tons burden and 6500 horsepower.
A. number of steamers and tugs, includ
ing a British man of war, were sent to
the assistance of the stranded vessel, but
when the America Maru sailed the
chances of salving the vessel were very
Elight.
The American ship R. D. Rice, owned
by the California Ship Company, is lying
at the bottom of Kobe harbor. She
brought a load of 30,000 cases of kerosene
from Philadelphia to Japan, but soon
after her arrival the oil caught lire and
when the vessel was nearly burned to the
water's edge she was scuttled.
An inquiry was held before the United
States Consul and it then came out that
Captain W. W. Winn had refused his
men shore liberty. Three of them, named
John Morrisey, C. Gussen and A. Len
gers, took a lantern from the boatswain's
room, then removed the forward hatch
and went down into the hold among the
kerosene. They hoisted on deck twelve
planks and then after getting on deck
themselves they replaced the hatches.
With the planks they made a raft and
escaped ashore: Half an hour later the
ship was afire. Neither cargo nor ship
was insured. No decision had been
reached in the case when the Maru sailed
and a subscription was being taken up
for the crew, who had lost everything.
Henry Richards, cne of the crew, was
a sailor on the Baring Brothers when she
was burned in Kobe harbor three years
ago. He was at tirst suspected, but the
confession of the other men cleared him.
The British tramp steamer Adato. now
taking on railroad ties at Mission-street
wharf for South. America, is still remem
bered in Japan. She got into trouble
ovqt a cargo of coal she carried from
Moji and Captain J. M. Mclntyre is being
sued in the Yokohama courts for 10,706.79
yen by W. M. Strachan & Co., Ltd. The
ship is out under bonds and the captain
is represented by Japanese counsel.
Captain Lewis of the British ship Liv
erpool, now loading here for Europe, will
be sorry to hear that Dick, Bruhn & Co.
of Kobe had to pay a fine for doing him
a good turn. ' The Liverpool made a very
Ions' passage and was off the coast of
Japan for nearly a month before she
cauld get in. Running short of provi
sions' Captain Lewis was glad to pur
chase some rice from a Japanese vessel.
Finally the Liverpool got close enough to
be reported and Dick, Bruhn & Co. sent
a launch out to the vessel. Captain Lewis
told about all hands being on very short
allowance, so the launch went back to
Kobe and brought out a supply of pro
visions. After the Liverpool had sailed
for San Francisco the Customs authori
ties learned that the launch people had
boarded the vessel before them, so they
fined Dick, Bruhn & Co. 10 yen. It was
lucky the provisions were taken out to
the ship, as it was four days later before
she made port.
Twelve Japanese fishermen made a
phenomenal haul of fish. In fact they
captured - so many of the finny tribe
that the boat capsized under the load and
seven of the fishermen vrere drowned.
The other men escaped by swimming
ashore.

George M. Bowers of the United States
Commission of Fish and Fisheries has is
sued to the State Board of F.ish Commis
sioners a statistical bulletin of the fishing
industry on the Pacific Coast during the
year of 1S99. The number of persons em
ployed in fishing in the different coast
States is shown to be 19,528. The value of
vessels and apparatus is $12,873,377, of
which the share of California is $2,774,491.
The total product of fish in pounds is
219.337.S16, with a value of $6,316,171. Of
this California produced 74,462,089 .pounds,
valued at $2,568,383. The statistics for sal
mon canning show a total product of 1,

nia's product was 34,180 cases of Chinook
salmon, with a value of $159,468. Â¦'. Â¦ .
Exclusive of the salmon fishing branch

Title to Lands on Southern
Pacific Is Definitely v
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals, consisting of Judges Gilbert, Ross,
Morrow and Hawley,' handed down a de
cision yesterday morning affirming the de
cree of the lower court in the suit of the
United States of America against the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company.-
The suits were brought for the purpose
of determining the title to certain odd
numbered sections of land' .within- the
twenty and thirty mile limits of the grant
made by the United States to the South
ern Pacific Railroad .Company by act of
Congress of March 3, 1871, which lands are
also within twenty miles of The general
route of the Texas Pacific Railroad Com
pany from Yuma on the Colorado, and to
cancel the patents.' The Government dis
missed thejSuit in so far as concerned all
the lands mentioned for which patents
had been issued by It. except ,about 5000
acres â¢ which the Southern -Pacific Com
pany had contracted to sell to the Colo
rado River Irrigation Company. â¢ '.â¢Â¦â¢
The decree of the Circuit Court in re
lation to that portion of the land on the
appeal of the Southern Pacific Company
is affirmed. In the appeal taken by the
United States relating to the lands em
braced within the primary and undeter
mined limits of what the appellants con
tend was the definite location of the route
of the Texas Pacific Railroad Company
the evidence in the record, taken in its
entirety upon this point, â¢ shows clearly
that the line of the Texas Pacific Rail
road fi*om Fort Worth by way of San
Gorgonio Pass to San Diego was never
in any manner known to the law definite

is upon all points affirmed. . *

An amendment to the constitution
adopted gives the circles the right to hold
session either 1 day or night, but they shall
not open later than 8 o'clock a,% night. ;
Another amendment adopted -was one
which affects the old law as to doctor a:id
medicine for ' members. , In the i past a
member of a circle who did not pay dues
for three months became unflnancial and
was deprived of doctor and medicine
or cash benefits for a certain period,. but
the amendment â¢ limits the deprivation
now to cash benefits only.
The law* .was also changed so that one
of the trustees of a circle shall go out of
office every six months.
A resolution. was adopted requesting the
Subsidiary High Court to admit female
members of the order to the privileges of
the endowment feature. . Â¦ 'Â¦
In the evening there was a reception to
the grand officers and the delegates from
the interior by the local circles in the so
cial hall of the Koresters' building. There
was a large attendance. Those piesent
were entertained with i a programme of
music and songs and with dancing.
This morning, weather permitting, there
will be a trolley ride for the officers and
delegates, in the afternoon there is to bo
a business session and in the evening a
theater party at the Central.

The Sultan of Turkey has sent an embassy to China,
and while it is not known whether theintention of the

the embassy is said to have been prompted by the

The refusal of the Queen of Holland Xq pay her
husband's debts has raised a pretty controversy among
folks who are interested in royalty. One side says
the refusal is a sign the Queen doesn't love her hus

than an evidence that she is so sentimental she doesn't
know that love has anything to do with money.
1 We may -therefore anticipate * that Â¦ the final .'settle
ment with China will approximate closely the just and
worthy views of the. President and Secretary of State,
We believe the other nations Will find it hard to
finally differ very widely from the principle's ' which
this country has observed. Every Government
must in a measure respond to the public opinion that
its people form and express, and the people are not
blind to the justice and righteousness of the position
of the United States^ nor unaware, of the benefits that
must issue therefrom.- The ibloodthirst- is passing
away and reason is asserting control of the \ public
mind of England, France, Germany and even': Russia.
This land is proud of them and their work, and we
point to it as a real missionary service, though ren
dered entirely as a civil matter of government. It
not only stands as a model for other Governments and
a standard by which they will be judged \n. history,
but as an example to the missionaries themselves, who
have not scrupled to criticize it and declare their
preference for the methods of other allies, which were
fashioned by. any rule except the golden.
THE American relief expedition to China is in
process of withdrawal. Its mission is accom
plished, and every step that it took - reflected
honor upon the moral and military character of the
United States. This country never appeared anywhere
in a more creditable light than in the difficult, delicate
and vexatious situation in China. The President and
Secretary Hay have treated that empire from, the
standpoint of the highest justice. ' They have added
not a featherweight to its burden of humiliation, but
have done what they could, and accomplished greatly,
in the lightening of that load.

WE learn frpm the Mobile Register that at a
recent conference., of the negroes of Alabama
at Camp Hill there were adopted a series of
resolutions, which, after declaring a belief "that the
Almighty God suffered the negro to be a slave to the
white-man a short time on the American soil, that
he might imbibe the principles of civilization .and lib
erty," went on to add:, Â¦ â¢. â¢Â¦â¢>â¢Â¦ , â¢ '.'-.Â¦ *.
JVhereas, The calling of a constitutional convention In
the State of Alabama to disfranchise the negro Is but
the voice oÂ£ .the Almighty God summoning him â (the
negro) to, return to his native land, Africa, 'be It
Resolved, That this organization shall be known as
the Afro-American Exodus Union; be it
Resolved, further, That every negro In the State of
Alabama ' use. every effort to liquidate his debts, all his
time at work and live economical that he may have
means of exit when. called upon, by the Afro-American
Exodus Union to colonize in Africa.
Commentng. upon the event the Register exclaims
of "the pity of it'\ and ."the pathos of;it." There is
a suggestion that the resolutions express the desire of
a few scheniers who hope to make money out of the
exodus of: negroes to Africa, rather than the general
sentiment of the negroes; but it is. admitted that even
if the suggestion be true there; would. still be cause
of sadness in the fact that an assembly of fairly intelli
gent negroes should have been persuaded to adopt
them. Â¦ â¢ â¢â¢ . :
Whether the resolutions proceeded from deception
or from despair of any advance for their race in this
country, it Js none the less clear that such ideas shquld
be combattcd. . . In â¢ fact it .might be worth while for
the Southern States to investigate whether there^ be
not some fraudulent scheme back of this new agitation
in favor of negro migration. The; more intelligent'
negroes are not likely to" be 'deceived by it, for they
know that this is their country and that' there is really
no place for them in Africa. -Professor Booker Wash
ington and others of his school have the right counsel
for the. colored people. There is a. future in this coun
try for any man, -white .or black, who is industrious,
thrifty and of good morals. , It is doubtful if the Al
mighty had anything whatever to do with calling Ihe
Alabama' constitutional convention; but if he had it
is certain he did not intend it as a voice summoning
the negro to return to Africa. r; Â¦ -"
THE NEGRO AND HIS PROBLEM.
IN San Francisco great preparations were made, on
a scale of lavish expenditure, for the reception and
entertainment of the President By far the
greater part of these plans went to wreck when the ill
ness of the President's wife made impossible his par
ticipation in the functions prepared in his honor. In
such a large and enthusiastic population as ours it
might have been expected that there would have been
expressions cf disappointment at the curtailing of
such a programme. But none has been heard. Our
people forgot all else in heartfelt solicitude, and there
was no pretense in the hush that fell upon the city
when the bulletins of the physicians told of the serious
condition of their patient, and every man went to the
impulses of his own heart and found there genuine
sympathy for the President as the sole sentiment
worthy to be entertained.
It may not be expected, therefore, that we feel
kindl}' toward the source of ungracious criticism and
unmanly complaint. â¢ The only break in the general
spirit of fellowship with the President in his anxiety
is found in the columns of the Portland Oregonian,
which has exploited its meanness of spirit in small
and annoying editorial flings at the President, insinu
ating his responsibility for a disappointment which
yood men do not feel.
The 'general sentiment is that President McKinley's
example of devotion to his wife is about as useful as
any thut he could set for his fellow citizens to follow.
Suppose he had done otherwise, and had left his wife
at home to suffer from an unusual separation, and
perhaps endure equal illness in his absence, or had
left her sickroom to take part in the cheerful func
tions intended for him, would American manhood
and womanhood have been inspired as highly as they
have been by his natural, human and most proper
course? The heartless and unfeeling style in which
the Oregonian speaks of Mrs. McKinley will not soon
be forgotten. It is not an expression of Western
chivalry, and is disgraceful to the paper and its
editor.
None could have foreseen that the President, his
wife or any other member of the party would not
succumb to illness. Yet the Oregonian plainly insists
that for any of them to be attacked by disabling sick
ness is somcthing^hnt calls for popular resentment.
We leave the Oregonian and its exhibition of bad
taste and bad temper, amounting to coarseness arid
brutality, to the judgment of the well-ordered and
good-mannered people of Oregon. It is unable to
injure the President, but may injure a community
which it misrepresents.

Schools and Missions.
The Congo Fiee State has realized
frcm the very first the importance of the
spiritual welfare of the nation and Its
first effort is directed toward .the child,
but having as its principle the respecting
of native liberty it In no way interferes
with the education of those children to
ward whom the parents -accomplish their
duty; the task of winning these children
to 'what we consider a civilized education
is left to the missions. The state takes
under Its wing all children wha are aban
donee, those who have been rescued from
the Arab slave traders and those whom
thi' parents willfully neglect. For these
children schools have been established
tnroughout the state, and there the rising
Jilack generation :s taught every conceiv
able trade destined to be of any use in
Africa. Besides these schools, which may
be compared with our orphan asylums,
there are mission schools, numerous, well
conducted and giving really gratifying re
sults. And yet children are not the only
ones who go 1 to school in the Congo, for
every station, every camp, every post,
every workshop or workyard is a real
school governed by wise rules and regu
lations, where, by contact with the white
r-'an, the native familiarizes himself with
what we flatter ourselves is the highest
degree of civilization, our own.
Protestant missions flourish alongside
of the Catholic missions and all are doing

Hesults of the Great Enterprise.
Many, voices have been raised against
tho state, Its government and its King:
some missionaries have called the atten
tion of Christianity to what they con
eider to be terrible abuses: district agents
of large companie-s holding important con
cessions have been discovered perpetrat
ing the gravest of misdemeanors; some
F.uropeans in power have been accused
of murder and crimes even more terrible,
committed through abuse of their power
over the blacks when all superior author
ity has been too far away to keen its
watchful eye upon them. Yet in every
case that has bean brought' to light the
young state has never tried to hide its
shame, but has marie every endeavor to
bring the miscreants to justice.
In sÂ».;ch a new country,' such a vast
territory as the Congo, no nation has ever
succeeded in organizing such a-- govern
ment, in the short space of fifteen years,
as . that organized by King Leopold and
his able supporters. From every point of
view it may. justly be said that the Bel
gians have worked marvels in Central
Africa and. King Leopold, whose life work
it has- been, is now gathering ,the fruits
of his labors, and his subjects are reap
ing the benefit of that country, whose
riches are a source of steadily increasing
profits to those who have risked their
capital there.- The industry of Belgium
has found a -new outlet, the home mar
kets have become'anlmated by the steady
influx of the Congo's tropical products
and before many years we may safely
count upon the Congo Free State as the
wealthiest and most prosperous of all
tropical countries.
to it. THe Free State retains the. loan
for another ten years, paying interest at
the rate of 2H per .cent, no interest having
been oaid during- the first period of ten
years. This, then, is the only bond of
union between the two countries beyond
the fact- that they- have the same sover
eign.
An Enormous Country.
Covering an enormous - area, the Congo
Free State lies on the equator, extend
ing five degrees to the north and fourteen
degrees to the south. Of course the
Congo River is a most valuable feature
or the new country and is navigable from
its mouth to Stanley Falls, a distance of
900 miles, with the exception of the rapids
and falls from Yelala to Leopoldvllle on
Stanley Pool, a distance of 2S0 miles. The
union Of the two navigable portions was
absolutely essential to the future pros
perity of the State. In fact, Stanley
warned King Leopold that Jf a railway
were not built all the Congo Free State
would not be worth a dollar. . â¢
This warning was heeded and Colonel
Thys, often called the Belgian Cecil
Rhodes, started the project, .which at
first seemed an almost impossible .task.
After years of labor the railway was
opened in July, 1898, and its inauguration
brought the riches of the land to the very
doors of the civilized world. Splendid
first-class passenger steamers now run
regularly from European ports to Boma
and Matadi, and these, together with the
railway, bring Antwerp,. the world's mar
ket for the rich Congo produce, within
twenty days of Stanley Falls. -'.
The resources of this vast,. fertile terri
tory are boundless and the field for new
enterprises is without limit. Of most
value at present are the supplies of India
rubber and ivory. The profits .realized
in dealing in those products are enor
mous.
System of Government.
The administration of such a huge coun
try, peopled by millions of savages, has
proved one of the greatest problems of
colonization' that any body of men ever
attempted to solve. The supreme power is
vested in King Leopold, and the central
government, with its seat in Brussels, is
placed under the immediate control of a
Secretary of State, assisted by his chief
secretary; a general- treasurer and. three
general secretaries, who preside over the
departments of foreign affairs, finance and
the Interior. In Brussels also sits the Con
go Free State Supreme Court of Appeals,
composed of some of the leading members
of the B(*gian bar, and to which all ap
peal case3 are^ sent from Boma. From
Brussels are issued all laws and decrees,
and the local government, with its seat at
Boma, acts in obedience to the King and
his advisers in Brussels. The fact that
the central government is -at Brussels Is
merely a matter of convenience to enable
the. King to be in constant and direct
communication with his functionaries.
Secretary of State for. the Congo.
v Next to King Leopold, the chief figure
in the management of the affairs. of this
vast new country is Baron Van Eetvelde,
the King's Secretary of State for the Con
go." To him" is due the credit for the
splendid 'organization both of internal and
of foreign affairs. At Brussels, where he
is in constant communication with King
Leopold, he strives against great .obsta
cles to civilization and progress, combat
ing the Arabs, who continually seek to
escape the vigilance of the Congo,Govern
ment and carry on the slave trade, lls-^
tening to the complaints of the missiona
ries and introducing new reforms. .
B At Boma- resides the Governor General,
the State Inspector and several: directors
of 'departments, all of whom, -together
with the Judge. of. Appeal, the keeper of
deeds and a certaMT number of' other
members.- not exceeding .five, form the
Governor General'! consulting committee.
The different departments are those of
justice, transportation, - marine, >: public
works, commissary.- agriculture and in
dustry, defense,' public force and finance.
.For purposes of administration the, State
is subdivided into districts, over each of
which i is placed a I district commissioner
or deputy governor. : The. district, if very
far from the seat of government, Is again
subdivided (into . zones,', presided- over by
chiefs of zones, who correspond directly
with;. the Governor, though reporting all

UNIVERSITY. OP THE PACIFIC.
REPORTS of Â¦the"; sanguine hopefulness and
' general enthusiasm of all'^concerned", in the
celebration ;of, the jubilee ~6f the" University of
the Pacific will be read with gratification throughout
the State. The university is the 'first- institution
founded on.this coast by. the pioneers for the higher
education of youth. The teachers^ of the old missions
had done a noble and useful work, and for all time to
come the.peoi)le of will owe' to them . a
grateful jfriiemory; but "with theVcoming of the new
order ! of things there' came a demand for a new sys
tem .of education, and the University of the Pacific
was first institution of its kind to arise to meet
that demand. j , \ â¢ - \
The pioneers of California have been so frequently
confounded with the adventurers who came merely to
seek- .gold or to lead v(\\6. lives that it is important to
direct attention at all times -to those evidences which
attest the difference between them. The pioneers
sought wealth not for, itself alone but for the. pur
pose of laying the foundations of a well-ordered so
ciety and a greafr commonwealth. Among those evi
dences none are more impressive than" the establish
ment of schools i and colleges destined for â¢ all time.
Such seats of learning as the University of the Pacific,
Santa. Clara* College and others of a like nature attest
to the world the true character of the pioneers and
vindicate them from the supposition that uie'y aimed
at nothing more than gold and a life of lawless liberty.
For fifty years the University of the Pacific has
fought the good fight for liberal education against
heavy odds and under adverse circumstances. It had
in its favor.only the advantage of a happy location and
the support of earnelt.men" and women of the Meth
odist; church,vby which -organization it was founded
and has been ever since maintained. For a long time
it has had to carry a heavy burden of debt; but re
cently the indebtedness has been paid off, and the in
stitution enters upon its second fifty years with fair
prospects and the sustaining strength of a body of >
alumni who look to it not ohly'with gratitude . but
with pride and hopefulness. \ .- \
It is becoming more and more evWent that the
great universities of the country will 'never suffice
all. the needs of higher education in America, and,
despite their wealth and their increasing prestige,
there are still. many advantages to be counted on the
side of the smaller colleges and universities. These
advantages have beeft frankly recognized and pointed
out even by professors and presidents of the larger
universities, and it is not likely they will ever be over
looked by 'the earnest and studious youth of the
country. - Consequently as California grows the Uni
versity of the; Pacific will grow- also.
It is to be remembered, moreover, that the term
"smaller college'- is merely a comparative one. .The
University of the Pacific, though counted 'small in
comparison with that at Berkeley or at Palo Alto,
nevertheless would have been accounted a great in
stitution in any part of the country fifty years ago,
and still ranks far above many other universities- that
are justly counted important in the localities whose
people they serve. Judged by its work in the past, by
what it is doing now and by its hopes of the future;
it, may rightly claim a ...high rank among the educa
tional forces that help to elevate American life, and
its jubilee, therefore, is one in which all good citizens
may share in the enthusiasm and' expectations^of its
members.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
THE Presbyterian General Assembly, now in ses
sion in Philadelphia, complimented^ the West by
selecting as its' moderator; Rev. Dr. H. C. Min
ton of California. His Sunday, sermon in Calvary
Church was heard by a great- congregation, and of
course was able and impressive. 'He improved the op
portunity to open a discussion between the church he
represents and the public school system of the coun
try.. He said: "God forbid that I should say an ill
word against our public school system, the safeguard
of our nation; but is the educational machinery sub r
sidiary to the only worthy end, 'of fashioning charac
ter? Have we, so morbidly afraid'of uniting church
arid state, gone so far' as to disunite God from the
state? This is a most serious. question. The faith of
our sons and : daughters is involved, and the kingdom
of God in our country is involved. It is not an or
ganized skepticism that threatens, but a God-forgot
ten secularism."
This sober utterance brings up the old discussion
of the nature and purpose of civil government. An
ciently government was theocratic. The kingdoms and
empires that preceded or were concurrent' \vith> the
Jewish commonwealth were, like it, theocratic' From
it the system descended to. modern- ages-.. The first
foundations of government on this . continent were
distinctly theocratic.
But that impulse spent itself, and duringj the last
century and a half government has progressed
toward pure secularism. The state is now recognized
as a secular institution entirely, wherever it is republi
can in form. When government was theocratic the
church was first, taking precedence of the state, and
naturally the education of the people was its concern,
and they were educated for the purposes of the church,
the purposes of the state being incidental.
When this republic was founded the establishment
was made secular. Withdrawing from relations with
the church, it ordained the equality of all forms of
the religious, idea, and made it impossible for any to
exist by toleration' since to tolerate anything implies
the power to forbid it. The various forms .were left
independent, to exist by their merits and by such ap
peal as they could make to the enlightened reason and
conscience of man. As a necessary condition of this
equality the state took charge- ~m education. The the
ory of our public school system is that as the State
rests upon the , intelligence of the people, it has the
right to educate, them solely for. the secular purposes
of the state!' This is the direct antithesis of the'theo
cratic method. ~When the church educatesâ and we
use the term "church"- in its inclusive sense, meaning
the whole assembly of religious bodies of all creeds â
it educates for the purposes "of the church primarily,
the state being secondary.
There can be no compromise between the two the
ories and the systems that spring from them. Rev.
Dr. Minton shows this plainly in his strongly put
statement. Secularism, which means the material ends
which the state promotes, is, in his opinion, the dis
union of God and the state*. He stands in denial of
the possibility of fashioning character in the secular
schools. So it will 'be seen that there is no middle
ground between the two tlieories. The state stands
impeached of inability properly to form character by
directing the education of the people, and the church
is put forward as the sole trustee of that function.
The issue joined is very distinct, and there are many
indications that iir public discussion, and perhaps in
American politics, it may soon displace all other is
sues and come into focus for a trial of strength, and
an attempt to reverse the' judgment of the founders
of the republic. - Â¦Â¦;'. - 'â¢ '-'/-. "Â¦Â¦;Â¦'Â¦ -:
7 u st at this time the raising of the question. is full
of interest, because Rosebery^ and other English
statesmen in seeking the reason for the sudden and
irresistible advance in material power ; of the United
States, which threatens the commerce and industry of
the whole world with subjection, find it in our public
school .system. The mainspring in our remarkable
advance is believed to be the initiative of our people.
Every man is a thinking unit, capable of action under
any circumstances, without waiting for orders nor
looking further for authority than to his own knowl
edge. This initiative is acquired in the public schools,
and has come to be the quality which the state de
sires for its purposes. It is not possessed by any
people trained by any other system. ' .
The public schools are supported by taxation of all
the people. The taxing power is secular and civil. If
the schools cease to be secular, or their secularity is
at all diluted, it will be seen that to that extent taxa
tion for their support becomes a tithing process for
the purposes of the church and not of, the state. Such
taxation would be obnoxious to the provisions of the
Federal constitution, so'we do not go far in the direc
tion toward which Dr. Minton p'oints until we' run
against the fundamental law.
Perhaps it will be well if the issue come up for.dis
cussion, since a system so long in action comes to be
taken as a matter of fcgurse by the people, and they
lose sight of its origin and the reason for its existence.
perience goes lar toward enlightening the
rulers of this enormous tropical land. It
is quite certain that no more abuses exist
in the valley of the Congo River .than In
any other African colony, whether Brit
ish, Dutch or French. This is saying
much, for the Belgians have been in Cen
tral Africa but fifteen years, while the
British and Dutch colonies are old.
People of the Congo Free State.
. One of the most interesting features of
the Congo Free State is its people, who
are divided Into many tribes, all differing
essentially from one another. Apart from
some $ well-known individuals, . such as
Muene Putu and Muata Yamvo, in the
south; Munza r.nd the Sultans Semio and
DJabbir in the north, the latter reigning
over a large area, the population of the
valley of the Congo lives in independent
tribes, each under the rule of a chief
whose power is over a number of subjects
not greater than the population of a me
dium-sized European village. Most of the
native villages contain no more than fifty
habitations, which include a population of
from 200 to 250. . Â« â¢
The defense of such an enormous terri
tory as that of the Congo Valley was at
first an almost hopeless problem and yet
from 110 men in 1SS9 the armed force rose
to 12,000 In 1900. This "force publique" is
the guardian of the peace, the guaranty
of the state's security, and may be ranked
among the best of colonial armies. Or
ganized, instructed and disciplined by Bel
gian officers, the Belgians are naturally
Â¦very proud of its well known and fully
recognized efficiency, for it has freed the
state from the Arabs and protected Its
frontier from invasionâ notably from the
The fact that Leopold II is sovereign
of the Congo Free State leads many into
the belief that that country ! Is, after all,
bur' a colony of Belgium. This is by no
means the case, for though it is true that
the entire Government of the Centra]
African -nation is Â¦, In the hands" of ' Bel
gians Â¦Â¦ v/ho . have entered its service, the
State owes allegiance .to no country or
people. Belgium, however, has a finan
cial claim ori the revenues, of "the State,"
for by virtue of a treaty dated July 1,
1890, â the Belgian Government agreed to
loan to the Free State the sum of $5,000,
000, $1,000,000 to be paid down on the sign
ing of the convention and $400,000 annual
ly for ten years. Six months after tne
last paymentâ made in August, 1900â the
Belgian Government reserved the right
to annex the entire Congo Free State as
e. colonv. Â¦ - \
The Government, however, is not dis
posed to raise the question of annexation,
as the majority in Parliament is opposed

The case of the city and county of San
Francisco vs. Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Bank
was dismissed yesterday, by United States
Circuit Judee Morrow on the default of
tho plaintiff.
The suit was brought in the Superior
Court on December 20, 1900, to collect $61,
513 58 taxes alleged to be due for the year
1896. . ' .
The Items of assessment specified in the
complaint were as. follows: Franchise,
$10,000; fixtures, $5000; solvent credits, ?182,
217; agency accounts, $3,012,036;- money,
I475.5S5; 20 per cent raise on $15,000 by State
Board of Equalization, $3000;. total, $3,687,
838.
After the case had been assigned to
tho United States Circuit Court the de
fendant put in a demurrer on the ground
that its name was not "Wells, Farg-o &
Co.'s Bank," but "Wells, Fargo & Co.,"
and that tho "items of * assessment as
quoted in the foregoing are unintelligible;
that the year in which the -taxes are al
leged to have been delinquent Is not de
terminable by a perusal of the complaint,
and that the cause of action is barred
by the provisions of subdivision 1 of sec
tion 338, Code of Civil Procedure." The
demurrer was filed on December 21, 1900,
by E. S. Plllsbury for the defendant.
On March 4 of this year S.'C. Denson,
as attorney for the city, appeared in court
and announced that plaintiff confessed thu
demurrer and consented that it should.be
sustained. The court asked Judge Den
son how much time he required to file
an amended complaint, and Judge De"nson
requested twenty days. â¢ The plaintiff
failed to file an amended complaint within
that period or at all, and default was en
tered and Judgment given for the defend
ant with costs.

MOST SEVERE STORM -
TO THE COAST
Yesterday's K-ain Was Very Heavy
Throughout Central and North- j
em Parts' of California.
The officials of. the weather bureau re
port yesterday's storm as being excep
tionally heavy and very peculiar in many
of its features. The trend of the storm
was from Point Conception to Cape Men
docino. It originated outside the bay of
San Francisco and moved rapidly in a
north-easterly direction, covering a large
amount of territory. During the space of
twelve hours it traversed a distance of
600 miles. It is reported to be one of the
greatest storms in this section of the
country since the~ establishment of the
bureau. . j
Another interesting fact In connection
with if is that it has rained but five times
on tho 20th of May %ince 1*52. It is
probable -that there will^be no rain in
Southern California below Fresno. The
forecast for to-day is south-westerly
winds, warmer a^d clear.

They Arrest an Innocent -Man and
Allow a Smuggler to Slip
Away.

the United States against J. M. Wolf, the

December. Wilson left as soon as t'.ie
Customs officers arrested Wolf at the

man had had a chance to deliver the
trunk, and by their bungling haste al
lowed Wilson- to escape. . v
Judge Heacock said that Wolf was an
innocent men. and should not have been
arrested. He is 60 years old and has al
ways borne a good reputation. The fiasco

named Loftus from Seattle. ~

NEW TORK. May 20.â The late upward
movement cf stocks last week failed to con
tinue to-day, although there was some resist
ance at times In the way of strength for Indi
vidual stocks. There was a progressive decline
In the influence of those special movements
and the day closed with the market quite ac
tive and decidedly at about the lowest of the
day all -around. There were one or two unfavor
able new features during the day, but there
>vere also some developments which had a
lavcrable Interpretation. The market was not
very manifestly influenced by the imws of the
day, but seemed rather to move as the result
cf technical causes. Taking of profits on last
week's late rise was the principal of these
causes. The market gave growing pvldence of
Us abandonment to the c;atÂ» of professional
operators, ecme of them of large fneans and
bread methods, but with the publifc evidently
rot a factor in the market and disinclined to
rerpond to the temptation of. price movements.
The maxim of the professional operator to sell
â¢Jtecks en a show of strength and to buy them
In en a decline comes In to interrupt the move
jnf nt of prices "before it has extended far In
Â«>ithÂ«r direction and to bring the market jcon
ftafttly nearer to aetate of equilibrium. The
market opened irregular and yielded all around
to the realizing, but' recovered quite strongly
in response to a movement In the â¢ coalers.
There was some strength also lamong the
Southwestern^, apparently on the score of pub
lished reports of a projected new steamship
line from a Mexican port to the Orient. The
ctnrfcnaa fact that the struggle fot- control of
the transportation of future trade products to
lb* Orient lies at the roct of most of the move
n.ents working out in the transcontinental ter
ritory civee any suggestion fn this line an In-'
fuence. The movement In the coalers was ap
rarently speculative. The strength In St. Paul
was not explained by any news, but the buy
ing was called good. The stock yielded, how
over, in the late- -weakness and closed at a net
Ws. The weakness of Union Pacific was an
effective factor in upsetting the market. Alle
Â»at ions of a further issue of convertible bonds
to finance the purchases of Northern Pacific
rtook were the prime factors In the" stock's
v.-i Ek,icÂ«Â«. It closed at par. 7 points below
Fatrrday's close, and at the lowest of the day.
Othrr notable weak stocks were Atchison.

viaknew. Among them were the international
Paper stocks. American Linseed stocks. United

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, May 20.â In response to the Liver
pool market, which failed to follow Satur
day's advance on this side, July wheat opened
%C lower to unchanged at TI&c to 72%c. During
the forenoon, however, the price rose to
73Â»{c. This was based chiefly on the purchase
of approximately 2,000,000 bushels by a single
firm, although the statistics were sufficiently
bullish to aid materially in enhancing the val
ues. Traders who were short of July In most
cases covered on the advance. At 73V4e the ad
vance was checked by the heavy sales of an
influential operator. He unloaded about 2,000,
000 bushels at 73 or better and sold until the
price reached 72Vic. The market closed steady;
July unchanged at 72%c.
Corn held firm In thi face of very heavy re
ceipts because one firm bought a quantity esti
mated at 2,500,000 bushels of July, believed to
be mostly for shorts. May was also in de
mand. July closed %@%c higher at 44%c May
rtosed lV4c higher at 48c.
Oats were active and Etronu On a demand
from country Interests. July closed %@ J ,4c
higher at 28%<S'2S%c.
Strength In lard was the feature In specula
tive trading in provisions. The market was also
helped by the corn strength. July pork closed
7%c higher, lard 10c up and ribs 5@7 l /ic im
proved. !

CLOSING
Spsculation was dormant on the Stock Ex
change here to-day. The tone of the general
market, however, was steady. There are
many signs of returning confidence In Ameri
can shares. They opened well, with some ac
tivity, though about a dollar below parity, and
early sales by cable here for New York caused
some sagging. Then, however, there was a
rally to the best prices of the day, under the
leadership of the coalers. . Northern Pacific
spurted 10 points. Copper was firm.- Money
was firm.

LONDON, May 20.â The. wool auction sales
closed to-day with offerings of 11,952.. Competi
tion was fair and prices were generally firm.
At the opening of the series merinos met with
a good demand at unchanged rates. German,
French and home buyers operated with great
freedom, particularly when New South V>ales
and Queensland flne-haiied stock was. offered.
This competition soon advanced the price of
these grades 5 to 7% per cent. Medium and in
ferior grades also hardened 5 per cent, but
later, owing to a falling off in the volume
of Continental competition, values receded
somewhat. The close, however, was firm at
par to 5 per cent above the March average.
During the series 22S.C17 bales were cata
logued, of which 103,000 bales were sold on the
Continent, 4000 to'America, 4S.000 held over and
the remainder to the home trade.

The Allls-Chalmers Company^j-epresenta the consolidation of the property and business
of the following builders of heavy machinery: . .

Frasei* & Chalmers, incorporated, of Chicago, 111.
. Gates Iron Works,,of Chicago, 111.
Dickson Mfg. Co , of Scranton, Pa. (exdnvrz of Locomotive Wcrki).
All property acquired Is to. be conveyed In fee and free ' from mortsrase o*
other lien.
No mortgage can be placed upon the property without the assent of seventy-five per
cent, of the amount of Preferred Stock outstanding.
The expert engineer. Mr. Julian Kennedy, reports, after several personal examinations
of the properties, that he estimates "the value of the plants, taking^ Into account the real
estate buildings, machinery, tools/ patterns, drawings and patents, together with tho cost
of organizing and getting Into full operation, bnt not estimating anything tor
eooA will, at $0,035,000."
He further reports, under date of April 5. 1901. as follows: i
"I find the plants all running at their fullest capacity. The great bulk of the tools
In all of these are comparatively new, having been put In within tha last seven or eight
years, and all the works are In good condition and running smoothly;," '.,' â¢
The security of the Preferred Stock, without any consideration for the ad-
vRntafce" acrfritinq: from the consolidation, for the -valuable good frill
of the nevejral Companies, so long and favorably known all lover the world, or
for the earning capacity of the United Companies, will' be substantially as follows:
Cash Capital *â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢ ? â¢ $10,000,000
of which Ham $2,B00,0O0 will be expended in thi t
' erection of an additional plant to donble the pres >
ent capacity of the Allls Works.

and free of lien â¢ 9,035,000
Total prenent value of tangible property ! 10,035,000
The total issue of Preferred Stock agfalnst this prop-
erty is* 16,250,000
all of which is Issued for cash at par. or. in lieu of cash, for the plants at less than their
valuation as above stated, and Â¦ of which total Issue there will be mor Â¦ than 61 per cent.
v In cash, and the balance will be In property that produces much mo than the cumu-
lative dividend to which the Preferred Stock is entitled.
Of thej total Preferred Stock. $7,830,000 has been accepted by tha or! nal Companies in
â¢ lieu of Â¦ cash. In part payment for their properties to be conveyed to t s Company. Tha
* remaining $8,400,000 Is now offered for sale to provide for the discharge of existing mort-
gages and for part of the above-mentioned Cash Capital, the remainder hereof being pro-
vided by the sale of Common Stock already consummated. â¢ .
The accounts of the several concerns have been' examined by Messr Jones. Caesar A
. Co.. chartered accountants, who certify "that the combined profits of t Â¦ ese Companies. In â¢
each of the last two fiscal years, after making full provisions for Â¦ de i edatlon and bad
debts, but without charging interest and management salaries, exceed " 1 the amount re-
quired to pay seven per cent dividends upon $16,250,000 Preferred Stock. Whilst for tn> last
I fiscal year the profits, as above defined, considerably exceeded such arpeunt." It .was not
until the last year that thejiew works of Fraser & Chalmers came iMo full operation.
The net profits for the iiscal year ending May 1, 1302, are estimaWd by the- chief of fl-
clals'of the respective companies, without any allowance for increaii of manufacturing
capacity, or for the economies of consolidation, or Increase of priceW at sufficient to pay
dividends at the -rate of seven per cent, on the $16,250,000 Preferred jStock and about four
per cent, on $30,000,000 of Common Stock. Including the economies ftbm consolidation con-
fidently anticipated by these authorities, .the net profits for the *ime period should ex-
ceed the amount required to pay seven per cent, dividends on bothr classes of stock.
' The same officials similarly estimate that upon the completion, of the additional Allls '
"Works, now In process of construction, the profits will be equivalent to eight per cent.' on
$16,250;000 of Preferred Stock and ten per cent, on $20,000,000 oÂ£ Common Stock, with a
material addition to the Surplus Account. /

Carnegie's gift has been almost the sole
topic of conversation in Edinburgh to
day. Sir William Mulr, principal of the
University of Edinburgh, when inter
viewed on the subject said: ' .~
I regard the gift as one of extraordinary
munificence, and there is no doubt it will
largely increase the number, of students. I
believe that another result will be the free
ing of secondary education. Possibly the;Gov
ernment would make a grant for this purpose.
Arthur P. Laurie, principal of the He
roit-Watt.College, Edinburgh, said:
I do not hesitate to characterize the' appli
cation of the money . as a- mistake. : Poor
parents cannot afford to keep their children
â¢during a university course, and free university
education would prejudicially affect Institu
tions like the Heroit-Watt Collese. . If Mr.
Carnegie would devote the money to the bet
ter endowment and equipment of universities
it would do an immense deal of good. â¢
LONDON, May 20.â A meeting was' held
in London Saturday to accept Mr. Carne
gie's gift. Â¦ Among -ythose present were
Lord Elgin,' ' Thomas Shaw, M.. P.; A. J.
Balfour, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
John Morley, James Brytee and others.
The matter was discussed at length, but
no conclusion was arrived at as to the
best methodof administering the gift. â¢
Carnegie declares - that all Scotchmen
and Scotchwomen shall enter the univer-.
sities on an equal footing," hence the
money is not given to the students to pay
their fees, but to. the universities them
selves. . . - , ' â¢ '
The system Is made perpetually free and
probably will be under Governmen^aus
"Accordlng to tho educational authorities
the addition of Carnegie's gift presents
considerable difficulties, and for this rea
son the Scotch papers for the present are
rather looking the gift horse in the mouth
while the English press is inclined to cavil
at the method of Carnegie's munificence.
' v The leading Scotch paper, the Edinburgh
Scotsman, says editorially. that Carnegie s
offer is "disconcerting from its very mag
nificence" and proceeds to: show that the
gift I might disorganize the : whole educa
tional system. It points out. that the fees
which students pay are only a small part
of the cost : of educating them, the're
mainderi being; supplied oy. endowments,
and thatHf Carnegie's project were ? to
bring an increase of students, the univer
sities would be compelled to appeal. to, the
public forfurther funds. Then.v If .uni
versity education * is free. ; the .country
will 'soon, be asked, the Scotsman^ con
tends/ to- make" Secondary, education free
also. Â¦â¢. In conclusion, it asserts ;tb^tA.','ac
ceptance of the offer demands Â¦ the,* most
careful' consideration, although citjis; an
offer which Scotland cannot deejine^with
out the best 6t good reasons." ' ( i>," 'Â¦:

"W. E. Davidson who becomes the head
of the Order of Railway Telegraphers on
the entire coast, is an old employe of the
Southern Pacific Company. He originalb
worked for them in Nevada and after
ward on the Sacramento division with
headquarters at Sacramento. When the
line between Benicia and Sacramento was
added to the western division he was sent
to Oakland to handle that very difficult
piece of road. He is one of the most ex
pert dispatchers In the employ of the com
pany and Is a man trusted both by the
company and by the Order of Railway
Telegraphers, whicn he now represents.
He now stands between the company and
1100 organized telegraphers out of 1300 em
ployed by the Southern Pacific Company.
Some changes have taken place in the
officers of the Order of Railway . Teleg
raphers on this coast that are of the ut
most importance and may have great
bearing upon the future of organized rail 7
road orders in this State.
George Estes. who has been the active
head of the Order of Railway Teleg
raphers on this coasc and who held the
position of general chairman of the South
ern* Pacific system division No. 53, has
retired from this position and Grand Mas
ter M. M. Dolphin has appointed W . h..
Davidson of Oakland to succeed him. t>.
A. Meyer, who was general secretary and
treasurer of the division with Estes. has
also retired and has been succeeded by-
D. W. Koppikus of East Oakland. The
resignations of Estes and Meyer are now
on their way to Grarid Master Dolphin at
the headquarters of the Order of Railway-
Telegraphers at St. Louis, and Dolphin
has wired the two appointments pro
tem. It is probable that both of the new
men will be given permanent places, as
they stand high among the telegraphers
and have held positions of trust before.
George Estes has been a most important
figure in railway employes' organizations
for several years, lie was originally sta
tion agent of the Southern Pacific Com
pany at Ashland, Or. When the Order of
Railway Telegraphers was extended to
this coast he became a member and was
soon advanced to the position of general
chairman of the Southern Pacific system.
the most responsible position that can be
given by the order on this coast.
He made his first public appearance dur
ing the great conference between the four
railroad ordersâ the engineers, teleg
raphers, conductors and trainmenâ with
the late Collis P. H'intington over the in
surance scheme. He was selected by the
general committee of all four orders to
present the case of the men to Mr. Hunk
ington. and he did it so well that he earnetT
great praise. He was even mentioned as
a candidate for grand master .of the Order
of Railway Telegraphers.
But when the new general railway or
ganization, the United Brotherhoed or
Railway Employes, was started,
,took a great interest in it. He travp'ed
about aiding in perfecting its organiza
tion, and is said to be slated for th# tiead
of the new order on this coast. Being u
natural organizer, his services were of
great use to the new order.
But his old order did not look witn
favor upon his activity in his new field.
How much this had to do with hip rÂ«v
tirement from the telegraphers is uncer
tain.

Mrs. Bonine Tells of the
Tragedy in Washing
ton Hotel.
AYERS' SLAYER
HAS CONFESSED
Mrs. Bonine acknowledged that she was pres
ent when the shooting occurred. She said that
some time prior to March 4 there had been a
â¢iisagrfeement between herself and Ayres and
that their friendly relations had been broken
until the morning before the tragedy, when she
became friendly with him again. She said she
had no watch nor clock to tell the time, but
it was some time in the morning, presumably
about 2 o'clock, when Ayres knocked on her
doer. She opened it and he told her he thought
he was going to have a chill and wanted to
know if she had anything that would prevent
it. She said that ehe thought she had eome
laxative Quinine and went to her boy's room
ed joining her' 8 to pet it. In the meantime he
was standing In the hall. He was dressed in
his troueefs, coat and undershirt. When ehe
came back 6he said ehe could not find the
quinine. Ayres threw hie arm over her
Fhoulder and asked her if ehe would not come
over to his room, where they could talk over
their differences. To this ehe assented, say
ing she would go as soon as ehe could dress
hereelt. She had been In bed when he aroused
her by knocking at the door and went to the
d->or in her nlsht robe. Ayres left her then
and went back to his room. She dressed her
Â¦olf, went to his room, opened the door and
entered. Ayres stood behind the door, and as
enon as ehe entered he slammed it and bolted
the lock. He was attired only In his under
shirt, and had a revolver in his right hand.
Fhe was very much agitated and attempted to
make a break toward the window to get out.
He went over and threw his left arm around
hnr. saying, "I guess you will listen to me
row."
Ayr*a rtffl had the pistol In hla right hand.
Fhe grabbed it with her right hand and threw
it up and it went off. In the struggle which
followed ehe got hold of the weapon with both
hands. She does not know how many shots
were fired and does not remember anything
about what took place until AyreR fell over
atrainst her and his blood spurted . over her
Fhoulder. Mrs. Bonine said it was she who
cried frr help and moaned.
Miss Minas, who occupied J.he next room, had
testified to hearing moans, but said she was
too frlÂ«rhtened to give an alarm. Mrs. Bonine
went throueh the window and down the fire
escape to t~* second floor, where there is a
landing. Ehe passed through the parlor and
upstairs to her room on the fourth floor. She
then washed her hands and the wrapper which
Fbe wore. Mrs. Bonine declared that she had
B'ver been intimate with Ayres, but that
when ehe went ir.to the room that nlÂ«ht he
tnade a proposition to her which she resented.
This was the first time he had ever made
ffueh a proposition. Prior to March 4 be had
sometimes been affectionate In his remarks,
but had never made any sort of Improper
propositions. She declared that the reasin why
fhe bad not said anything about the crime be
icre was that ehe wanted to preserve the good
name of her two boys.
Mrs. Bcnlne's statement will be submit
ted to the Coroner's jury to-morrow and
on their verdict will depend the course to
be pursued toward Mrs. Bonine. She has
engaged an attorney.
Story Told by Mrs. Bonine.
The tragedy Â¦which resulted, in Ayres*
death became known about half past 8
o'clock last Wednesday morning, when his
dead body was found in his room at 'the
Kenmore. a small family hotel of moder-
Rte prices, situated not far from the Capi
tol. The dead man's full name was James
Sfymour Ayres. He was between 20 and
21 years of age and lived in Port Austin.
Mich., before coming to Washington, as
a clerk in the census office. His father
la a man of some standing in Republican
Ptate politics in Michigan. An examina
tion of Ayres' body showed that he had
been shot three times, one ball entering
the left leg, another the left arm and the
third penetrating the heart and causing
death. Suicide was the first theory ad
vanced, but statements from two wit
nesf-es. that on the night of the murder
they had seen a woman descend a fire
ppcape leading from in front of Ayres'
room at the hotel end disappear into the
I arlor of the house, ended this theory-
Gradually facts were developed which
pointed to Mrs. Bonine, a guest of the ho
x?\. with whom* Ayres had been on very
friendly terras and Â¦with whom he had a
falling out. Mrs. Bonine, who had been
subjected to several examinations by a
detective without result, to-day told him
her story and asked his advice. He coun
seled her to tell all she knew, and In the
presence of District Attorney Gould and
the detective she again told the story of
the deed in her own words. Gould would
make no promise as to immunity from
punishment, however, and arrangements
were made for a complete and full recital
of the deed at the office of Major Sylvester,
the Superintendent of Police. Before go
ing to police headquarters, however, Mrs.
Bonine asked that she be allowed to tell
the story to her husband, who was at the
police station at the time. This she was
permitted to do. She then went to police
headquarters, where a stenographic report
was taken of what she had to say. Her
statement was entirely voluntary, i and
during its recital she appeared perfectly
calm and collected. In substance, as re
lated by Major Sylvester, Chief of Police,
it is as follows:
Finally Clears Mystery.
1 ?
WASHINGTON, May 20.â The mystery
attending the killing of James Sevmuur
Ayres. a census office clerk in the Ken
more Hotel early last week, was solved tr>
day by a voluntary confession from Mr-.
Lulu 1. Bonine. a married woman and a
Ruest at the house, that the three shots
which ended Ayres 1 life had been fired in
a struggle between herself and Ayres.
Mrs. Bonine. whose husband is c drum
mer for- the wholesale drug house of
Hewitt & Co., of Chicago, explained her
presence in Ayres' room at 2 o'clock in
the morning by saying: that he had come
to her room complaining of a chill and
asking for medicine, and had induced htr
to follow him to his room to talk over some
matters of difference there had been be
tween them. She said that she dressed
herself in a wrapper and went to his
room. He had preceded her, and when she
opened the door and walked in he quickly
closed it and informed her that he had
enticed her to the room for his own pur
poses, and said if she did not submit to
his wishes he would kill her. Avres, she
said, was undressed and had a revolver
in his hand, and In a struggle 'or Its pos
session which ensued immediately a:ier
Fhe entered it was discharged three times,
the shots striking Ayres at each, dis
charge, the last one proving fatal.
After her statement, which was made
to the Chief of Police and a number of
other officials, Mrs. Bonine was placed
under arrest and taken to the house of
detention, where she wil be held pending:
the result of the Coroner's inauest, which
has been in session since Saturday and at
Â¦which Mrs. Bonine was to have appeared
to-morrow as a witness.

CENT A MEAL
Economy in. Food.
"Ease in getting a "meal and economy,
are two important things," a lady teacher
Fays about the fully cooked food Grape-
Nuts. "I started In on Grape-Nuts be-
cause It needed no preparation whatever,
and I wanted a little lunch before going
to bed, so I had cream and sugar ready
and a package of Grape-Nuts. Pouring
a Uttle of the food into a saucer I treated
It with good rich cream and a little sugar
at v t!raes; usually it was sweet enough.
'1 had a meal that satisfied hunger and
I began to sleep well nights. After a
while I concluded to make my breakfast
of Grape-Nuts and a little fruit rather
than go to the boarding house. I found
that I began to improve very rapidly In
health, and my work became a pleasure.
"I have made a most Important discov-
ery, that is that I can have a meal served
at a cost of about one cent that Is the
most nourfshine meal that I have ever
been able to find, delicious In taste and a
real genuine 'food cure' for stomach and
bowel troubles.
"I have many friends using Grape-Nuts
Food regularly. ** This lady lives at Gros-
beck, Ohio. Name given upon application

Mrs. Nettie R. Craven's effort to secure
a. trial by jury to determine the validity
of the so-called pencil deeds. under which
she claimed property of the estate of the
late James G. Fair valued at 51.000,000 has
failed. A decision was handed down by
the Supreme Court yesterday affirming
the judgment , of the lower court, which,
after denying Mrs. Craven the right to
trial of the Issues involved In the case be
fore a jury, declared the deeds to be
forged, simulated and void. â¢
The deeds . which. Mrs. Craven and her
counsel were of opinion would be declared
valid by a jury were executed, it was
alleged by Mre. Craven, on September 8,
1894, and acknowledged before Notary J. J.
Cooney three days later.- They purported,
for the consideration of love and affection,
to convey to Mrs. j Craven two pieces of
real estate, one at the southwest corner
of Pine, and Sansome .streets, valued at
$400,000,^ the other on Twelfth and Mission
streets,, valued at $600,000.' /â¢:.-:
The opinion. of the Supreme Court was
reached in . the action . instituted . by the
executors of the will of the late James G.
Fair against Nettie R. Craven as defend
ant and appellant. The appeal was taken
by Mrs. Craven from a ruling of the court
denying- her motion for a trial by jury.
It was contended by, her counsel that the
action instituted by the executors of de
cedent's will to quiet Mr*. Craven's claim
to the property in question was one in law
and not an action for equitable considera
tion, and in view of their contention they
claimed the right to a hearing before a
i It was held by the court,. however, that
in the case both equitable and legal rights
were involved, and, exercising the right to
control the order of proof, it proceeded to
adjudicate the equitable issues. The court,
having found that all of the material facts
alleged by the plaintiffs -were supported
by the proof, issued an injunction forever
restraining Mrs. Craven "from asserting
or pretending that' the alleged deeds were
valid or genuine, or from claiming: or as
serting any right, title or interest in the
property- involved under the deeds." .It
was also decreed that Mrs. Craven had
no right, title or interest to the premises
and that the prayer of the complainants
that she should be compelled - to deliver
up the deeds for cancellation - should be
granted. .
: In the opinion of the Supreme Court,
which was written by Justice McFarland
and concurred in by Justices Van Dyke
and Garoutte, Justice Henshaw writing a
concurring opinion. Justice Temple dis
senting, it is held that the lower court did
not err in denying . Mrs. Craven's motion
for a.triaUby jury of the issues involved
In the action. Â»
"For.V says the court, "when the law
raises a presumption, without direct proof
of the validity of a conveyanceâ and Its
validity can only be made", to appear by
extrinsic evidenceâ a case is presented for
the.exerciee of the jurisdiction of a court
of . equity to compel the surrender 'and
cancellation of the instrument as a cloud
upon the title." ...
. Mrs.' Craven, as this opinion of the Su
preme Court only finally adjudicates the
motion for a trial by jury, will now return
to the ; Superior, Court and renew Â¦ her mo
tion for a new trial of, the action which
was decided- against her. .If this motion
is denied she .will again appeal, and the
validitv of the deeds ;whlch the lower
court has i adjudged forged and void will
be passed upon by. the court of last resort
within the State.

The two women who were yesterday
"professed" have taken the names of Sis
ter Gertrude Paular and Sister Jane
Natali. The first named was known for
merly as Mrs. Gertrude Ames and has
peen a resident of San Francisco for many
years. She is also the first Sister Superior
of the Order of St. Savior. The order is
distinctly Calif ornian. The two have passed
their novitiate in the- community of St.
John the Baptist, a New York Institution,
and for the past six years have been dill
gent students, in practical philanthropies.
Â¦ The distinctive garb Is of black, with
long, flowing sleeves, white hood and col
lar, with a black veil that is seldom
thrown back. A girdle is worn about the
waist, and suspended from the neck Is a
large silver cross. The first work under
taken by the new sisters will be to estab
lish a church home ! for girls. . The one
now at 655 Folsom street will be presently
removed to larger quarters. Work among
the sick poor of the Good Samaritan Mis-'
sion is expected to consume* much of the
sisters' time. Wherever the Bishop directs
these self-sacrificing women will go. The
pretty little chapel was made 'beautiful
by elaborate floral adornments.
The chapel of the Protestant Episcopal
Old Ladies' Homo was last Friday the
scene of a solemn and rarely witnessed
ceremony in churches distinct from the
Roman communion. It began at the early
hourof 8:30 and was attended only by the
associates of the order of sisters and a^
few personal friends. It was a ceremony
of profession of two devoted women into
the order of St. Savior, in which the holy
vows of poverty, chastity and obedience
were taken and the rest of their lives ab
solutely devoted to good works.
The Bishop of California 'officiated, as
sisted by Rev. Edgar J. Lion, chaplain of
the home. .
The service is one especially adapted for
these particular occasions, and through
out is of the most solemn character â a
few prayers, the singing of hymns, sen
tences of exhortation and warning, and
concluding with the eucharist. During
the service the novitiates assume the
garb of the order, worldly dress is thrown
asiae, never to be returned. A plain gold
ring is placed upon a finger, significant of
the assumption of new relations toward
the church and the never-ending ob
ligations which have been undertaken.
The &ermon was preached by the Bishop.
After the services a breakfast was served
to those invited, and with; the hearty con
gratulations of their friends the sisters
were launched upon their new career."

Fitch's "Barbara Frietchie." a tragedy of

It is a peculiarly constructed play. Up

Neill, the Captain Trumbull, of the cast.
Then when the captain goes upstairs to

his sweetheart, the sister of the man who
shot him unto the death, falls stricken

ment. Mr. . Miller's ; voice seems entirely
restored by the. rest he took last autumn,
and his company, though not quite equal
perhaps to- last year's, averages well
enough to make the performance smooth
and effective. - - , - T
Of that last year's companyâ the best I
have ever seen in San Francisco â only
Miss Elliston returns. Her face and voice
are pleasing as .ever, while her power of
characterization has improved. As .to
Miss Rockwell, it is no disparagement to
her to say that she is' not a Miss Anglin,
for Miss Anglin is one of the best half
dozen actresses in the United States. Miss
Rockwell, though a young lady of intelli
gence and charm, has not risen quite as
high as that yet. Miss Eustace as Lady
Neville .seemed to me a great improve-,
ment upon; Mrs. Boucicault.
Mr. Miller's acting needs no description
or â¢ commendation from me. Suffice It -to
say that I cannot imagine how anybody
could play Eric Temple better than he;
Indeed, it is this fatal excellence which
haÂ» condemned him to play this role so
otten; that way lies danger. Of the other
gentlemen Arthur Elliott showed an excel
lence that made even an uninteresting
part interesting. â¢ â
Mr. Miller had four or five curtain calls
after the third act, but sensibly refused
to make a speech. Would he had power
also to abolish the curtain call! But no in
fluence: terrestrial can stay the hand of
the American public when raised to shat
ter the mirror of dramatic Illusion.

Alcazar.
The capacity of the Â¦ Alcazar Theater
was tested to its utmost last night, not
withstanding the rain,' when the old fa
vorite "The First Born" was reproduced.
The only one of the original cast is
Charles Bryant, the pipe bowl mender,
but the other characters were happily as
signed. Miss Lila Convere made a very
charming and engaging Loey Tsing, and
fairly caught the. sympathy of the large
audience in the last scene. Howard Scott
as Chan Wang, the wronged husband and
father of Chan Toy, was powerful and ef-Â»
fective, and Barton Hill as Dr. Pow Len
was dignified und gracious. Charles Bry
ant is inimitable as the pipe bowl mender.
The scenery Is excellent and the music up
to the Chinese mark. The clever little
drama should have a long and successful
run. It Is preceded by the farce comedy
"Glorlana," which kept the large audience
in almost Incessant laughter. The situa
tions are funny in the extreme and the
most was made out of them by the com- 1
pany. All the characters are well sus
tained, and Frank Bacon as Splnks as
tonished his friends by a really clever
piece of acting In the second act, in .which
he impersonates th'e diplomat. ,
