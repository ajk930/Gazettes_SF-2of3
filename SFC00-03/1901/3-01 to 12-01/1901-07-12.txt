BELOVED PROFESSOR JOSEPH LE CONTE
IS LAID TO REST AFTER SIMPLE SERVICE
IN HEARST HALL AT THE UNIVERSITY
PITTSBURG, July 11.â The labor con
ference at the Hotel Lincoln to-day failed
to come to any agreement. Another con
ference will be held to-morrow. The ob
ject of thÂ« conference was the settlement
of the strike ordered by the Amalgamated!
Association of Iron, Steel and Tin "Work
ers in the mills of the American Sheet
Steel Company and In those of the Amer
ican Steel Hoop Company. The confer
ence also had another purpose in view*â >
the prevention of a general strike in all
the mills controlled by the United States
Steel Corporation, the two companies In
whose mills the strike had been ordered
being constituent companies of the great
steel combine.
Two sessions of the conference were
held to-day. The first convened shortly
after 10 o'clock in the morning. At noon
the meeting adjourned for dinner. At 2
o'clock in the afternoon the second ses
sion was convened, and was continued
until 3 o'clock. As a settlement within a
reasonable time was seen to be out of the
question, the conference adjourned to
meet at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Trust Managers Present.
The steel interests at the conference
weje represented by John "Warner of New
York, chief of the operating department
of the Sheet Steel Company; I. W. Jenk3
of Pittsburg, manager of the American
Steel Hoop Company; Hoyt Preston of
New York, late president of the American
Steel Hoop Company; Warner Arm3 and,
W. M. Leeds of New York, vice presi*
dents of the American Tin Plate Com
pany, and Charles XV. Bray of Pittsburg.
chief engineer of the'same company. Tbo
United States Steel Corporation Is said ta
have been indirectly represented by,
Messrs. "Warner and Preston.
At the afternoon session President Shaf
fer, in behalf of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation, formally presented the case foe
the organized workers and the strikers.
He laid stress upon the fact that until
this year the union had made no effort di
rectly to force a union in all the plants ofi
the combine for the reason that It 13
thought best to have that movement orig
inate and be carried on. among the work
men in the mills. . ,
Confronted by a Hew Condition.
Since last year, however, a new condN
tion confronted the union men. The offi
cials of the various companies had plainly
indicated, he said, that they are working!
on a policy for operating their non-union
plants in preference to the union mills and
only working the latter when It Is abso
lutely necessary. This plan, he declared,
is forcing the union men to desert the or
ganization in order to get work. The idlo
mills being union and the union men belnjj
rendered poverty-stricken as the price, for
being members of the organization, means
either that the Amalgamated Association
Is going to be disbanded soon or all tho
non-union mills will have to be mada
union, so that equal justice will be given
to all.
Matter of Life and Dsath.
It was a matter 'of life and death for the
Amalgamated Association that the non
union mills be done away with, Shaffer
said. The alleged methods adopted by tho
American Sheet Steel Company in prac
tically starving the employes of the Ofd
Meadow mills, in Scottdale. Into a non
union agreement was elaborated upon,
and the demand made by the company
that the mill be left out of the scale en
tirely in the future was taken as an Indi
cation of what .the general plan of the
company is in dealing with the Amalga
mated Association. It meant, he salfl.
slow starvation or else complete surrender
to the company, and the giving up of all
rights to organized union in their plants.
Denied by the Officers.
In reply to the statements of President
Shaffer the 'officers of the various compa
nies present gave an outline of their po
sition. They denied any intention of
working an injustice toward union work
men in their mills. The feeling for the
Amalgamated ; men had always been
friendly, they said, and they had no de
sire to force any trouble among them.

July 11.â -Tha strike of the
Newport News Shipbuilding
Company's machinists came
suddenly to an end to-night,
when by unanimous consent
the men decided to return to
â¢work Monday at the old scale.
The fact that ths machinists
could not obtain funds Â¦with,
which to support the idle- men
and that the shipyard man
agement had demonstrated its
ability to fill the vacant
places are responsible for. the
defeat of the strikers.

was filled to tne doors and a crowd ex
tended down tlic: steps into the clubroom,
and many remained outside the building
entirely.
Around the casket . were banked the
floral offerings and potted plants, while
palms and other greenery decorated the
angles of the hall. Among the floral of
ferings .was a preat hasket of white roses
sent by the academic' council. A French
wreath of palm branches, sea lavender
and lilies of tbe valley, a most artistic
piece, made by Mrs. F. E. Woodworth,

Memorial Service. Announced.
President "Wheeler stepped forward at a
sign from Bishop Nichols and said:
' At the .besinnins: of the academic semester
a memoriar service will be held in honor of
our, colleague; who'has passed from our view.
He stated then that, all who "desired
could : come . forward and look- upon the
face of Professor Le Conte for the last
time.
The procession left the hall in the order
and took a laat affectionate look at the
gentle face in the casket. Many of them
followed the body to Mountain View Cem
etery, where it was placed in the family
vault to await possible removal and burial
beneath the oaks of the Berkeley cam
pus or within the shadow of the towering
walls of his beloved Yose'mite.
The scholastic dignity of the ceremony
was in perfect harmony with its touching
simplicity. Clergymen In vestments, gray
haired professors and fresher faced youth
ful Instructors In faculty robes and mor
tar-boards, regents,' alumni and under
graduates In collegiate cap and gown
marched in procession from the residence
to Hearst Hail, and again, after the serv
ice, led the way from the. hall and along
the shady avenues of the college town.
No outbursts of sorrow disturbed the
serenity that nature gave the day. Keen
regret for the parting and sorrow that no
more would the great . teacher's kindly
smile be seen or his cheery volce.be heard
filled every heart. But grief that shakes
the body with sobs or that dries up the.
tears that would give relief was notice
ably absent. Death had come in Its least
repulsive form and had left those who
loved the venerable man composed In their
sorrow and reconciled to their loss. '
Service for Family at House.
A service at which only members of the
family were present was held at the resi
dence, 2737 Bancroft way, at 2 o'clock. It
was conducted by Bishop , William F.

of St. Mark's Episcopal Church' of Berke

ON NAVAL PROGBAIOIE
Secretary I/ong Confines Eecommec
dr.tion to Two Battleships and
Two Armored Cruisers.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
TV.. TTASHINGTOX. July ll.-Two battle
ships and two armored cruisers will con
{=titt:te the programme which Secretary
Long will ask Congress to authorize dur
ir.g the coming session. In limiting his
recommendation to this number and class
of ships, the Secretary Is influenced by
the evident purpose of Congress to grant
thi? Increase of material. The last naval
appropriation law contained a provision
directing the Secretary of the Navy to
prepare designs for two battleships and
two armored cruisers. In accordance with
this direction the Board of Construction,
under the Secretary's order, is considering
the characteristics of the projected ships.
Because Congress neglected to authorize
any armorclads at Its last session the
feeling among navy officials is that there
ehculd be a large enough increase at the
comlrg session to make up for this fail
ure. Attention is. however, called to the
large number of warships under construc
tion and the delay in their completion.
In order to minimize the opposition on
this latter score to nÂ«Â»w ships. Secretary
Long sent to-day a letter-to armor manu
facturers formally asking them to in
crease their deliveries. As the armor
companies have anounced their purpose
to meet the viewB of the Government the
department expects that the deliveries
will aggregate 1000 tons per month here
after Instead of 600 tons.
BOERS SEEN TO SHOOT

dered the British wounded at Vlakfon
telti promises soon to be forthcoming. In
the House of Commons to-day, replying
to questions of Henry Norman, Liberal,
War Secretary Brodrick read the tele
graphic correspondence with Lord Kitch
ener on the subject. The latter had at
first declared that the reports were un
founded, but he subsequently telegraphed
the statement of a wounded yeomanry of
ficer, corroborating the reports, and final
ly. June 9, informed Broderick that he
had the testimony of seven men to the
effect that they saw Boers shoot the
wounded. Lord Kitchener added that
sworn testimony was being forwarded.

THE committee headquarters of the
Epworth League was transferred
from the Young Men's Christian
Association building to Mechan
ics' 'Pavilion yesterday. The
change was accompanied by tremendous
activity and not a little confusion. The
chairmen of the various committees soon
had their work well in hand, however, so
that long before sundown affairs were
moving smoothly.
The registration and entertainment
committees were kept busy during the
afternoon registering- and providing ac
commodations for more than 400 leaguers
who arrived in the city at noon. Charles
H. J.' Truman, chairman of the entertain
ment committee, says the real work will
begin about Tuesday next, when forty or
more trainloads of leaguers are scheduled

Arrested.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, July 11.â The union fish-
ermen made a wholesale descent on the
Japanese fishing- on the Fraser River last
night and to-day. The result Is that
twenty Japanese are marooned In a secret
hiding place somewhere among the score
cf little islands in the Gulf of Georgia,
and on the" other hand six white fisher
men were arrested for molesting the Jap-
Ianese. A fight occurred in the gulf.
The news was late in arriving in this
city to-day, there having been a storm
â¢over the Gulf this morning, during which
6everal fishermen, whose names are un
known, were drowned. There were thirty
of the union riatrol boats in the fleet
â¢which went out after the Japanese last
right. Xot more than a couple of hun
dred boats of the latter were out cn ac
count of the bad weather. The patrol
boats visited every part of the fleet and
every Japanese who was fishing was
.ctopped, his net and outfit thrown over
board and his boat stove In and turned
adrift. In every case rifles were found in
the Japanese boats, loaded and ready for
action. . -p .-"'Â¦Â¦Â¦"
Bullets on the Biver.
Before the union patrol made a capture
i anywhere several shots were fired, but
none of these took effect and the Japanese
were usually overawed by superior num
bers. Frank Rogers, secretary of the
union, says his boat was coming up to
an outfit of Japanese when the latter fired
three shots in the air. The patrol boat
lay to until it was joined by another, and
approaching the Japanese from both sides
compelled them to capitulate. Their fire
arras were thrown overboard and before
daylight the Japanese were landed in a
secluded cove whose location is at pres
ent a secret. There they will be kept
until the present trouble is over and will
probably be joined nightly by other fish
ermen prisoners. If the present con
dition of affairs keeps up they will be
given plenty of food and will be well
looked after. ''. >? <
The police at present have no idea of
the location of this island. Seven of. the
Japanese boats last night carried con
stables secreted in the bottom fixtures.
Six white men tried to hold up one of
these boats. The union men were armed
â¢with rifles and revolvers and attempted
to board the Japanese vessel when the
officers jumped up and confronted them
with drawn revolvers. The strikers had
. to capitulate.
Chase After the Officers.
The two officers had the Japanese tow
the strikers' boat to. the western side of
' Vancouver, with union boats chasing them
â¢ all the way in. Several shots were fired
in an effort to release the white men, but
the latter were successfully landed and
were marched down through the resi
, dential streets and to the police station.
They were broug-ht up this afternon be
' fore a magistrate and the testimony of
â¢ one Japanese was heard. Then the cases
were adjourned and bail was refused.
There is intense feeling over the cap
ture of these men, end if they are 1m
. prisoned further trouble may be expected
. from the fishermen. The patrol fleet of
the latter went out again to-night to
harass the Japanese. ..:.-.
. The Japanese . held a big meeting at
Eteveston and raised by voluntary sub
- ecription $4000 for a Japanese hospital,
which they think may be -needed, and
then discussed the salmon catching situa
tion. Some were in favor of joining the
. union men In the strike, especially as the
run of salmon has been small this season
' tip to date. The meeting broke up without
Â¦ definite action. This evening a big run of
â¢ ealmon is reported as coming in from the
south. The canners think the union men
Â¦will not stand firm in view of the tempta
. tion to participate in their catching.
.There is renewed talk this evening of
calling out the militia.

them from the beach and they" went
ashore and took him to his boat. The El
len is also a sealing schooner.
Weak and exhausted, he was practically
a prisoner on the beach, for the hlutZ at
that point is almost inaccessible. For two
days he was alone on the beach without
anything to eat but raw abalones. Cn the
third day he plucked . up courage, anÂ«l
from . sheer desperation climbed the cUff

how he managed to get up the steep bluff.
" On the afternoon of July 3 the three
men attempted to go asliore in a cove on

is always treacherous. They were ap
proaching the shore when a blind break

without a moment's warning. Philipccn
and Krutzen went down, struggling- in tha

hang on to the bottom of the boat and
drifted several miles, at last being tossvd
ashore in a little cove near Pinnacle Rock.

is the use of the same hair brush by dif-

CHILD PERISHES
WITH MOTHER
GILROT, July tLâ The Del Monte flier,
due here at 5 p. m., ran over and killed
May Ladd, the 12-year-old daughter of J.
O. Ladd, to-day. The accident occurred
at the railroad crossing on the Hot
Springs road.-;
The child was driving a horse attached
to a buggy, and an eye-witness states
that before reaching the crossing she
whipped the horse to a run in order to
cross before tha train. The train was a
half-hour late and came toward the sta
tion at the rate of sixty miles an hour.
The engine struck the vehicle and horse
and the child was instantly killed. Por
tions of her flesh were found along the
track, and the greater part of her body
was fdund in the cattle guard, where It
was dropped by the cowcatcher. For
nearly a hundred yards the horsÂ»" was
dragged along the track.
As soon as possible the train was
stopped and backed to the scene of the
accident. The body was placed In a bug
gy robe and brought to town.
Engineer Stevens says ho did not see the
child until too late, as there is an orchard
obstructing the view of the road at that
point. . Â¦ .

; The men who made the request have for
the last four days been sitting as jurors
in the case of the people against Antone
de Sousa, who was accused of grand lar
ceny, it being alleged that the defendant
stole two cows, a red and a' sorrel, from
Louis' Gioli. a wealthy rancher near
Sausalito. The case was bitterly fought.
Sousa claimed that he had purchased the
cows from Dan Slinkey, the Sausalito
pound man, who. committed suicide some
months ago.
During the trial about forty witnesses
testified. The testimony was contradic
tory. Each side seemed to endeavor to
swear thÂ£ other out of court. As the case
progressed the attorneys. District Attor
ney Mclsaac and E. B. Martinelli for the
Â§rosecution and O. F. Meldon and Adolph
ylva for the defense, worked like beavers
piling up notes of the evidence to be used
in argument.
All this time the jury painfully watched
the piles of notes grow higher and higher.
They thought of their suppers and homes'
and the verbal bombardment that was
coming. â¢ Some yawned, some went to
sleep, but the lawyers would not take a
hint. At this stage Captain H. A. Gor
ley. foreman of the jury, passed â¢ up to
Judge Angellotti a written request asking
that the lawyers on both sides cut their
arguments out, as. the jury did not care
to hear them. This was a stunner. It
was a pioneer in judicial procedure. " The
Judge stated that he had no authority to
deny counsel the right to. talk to the jury
at the proper time. Meldon. for the de
fense was willing to | submit the case
without argument, but- Mclsaac and Mar
tinelli insisted on talking. After the argu
ment the jury retired and- soon brought
in a verdict declaring Meldon's client not
guilty. - Â¦-.:.'Â¦

LONDON, July 11.â The reported be
trothal of the Duchess of Albany
to the Earl of Rosebery was not
.unexpected. The widowed Duch
ess ami the bereaved Earl would
have been married long ago had not the
Queen declined to countenance the union.
So strongly did her Majesty insist- tl:at
in the seventeen years that have elapsed
since the death of Prince Leopold. Duke
of Albany, that the Duchess has avoided
society and devoted her life to the rearing
of her son anrl daughter." She invented
a peculiarly shaped school seat, for which
she received a gold medal and which is
now in general use.
In the midst of her studies, her schemes
for charity and social reforms she became
interested in the Earl She made a mild
attempt to win the Queen over to consent
to their marriage. The Queen would not
hear of it. and as tho Duchess v.as de
pendent upon an allowance made through
her rr.rthf:r-in-!:rw's will and did not wish
to offend her, she resigned herself to the
inevitable.
All is easy now, as the Prince of Wales,
the pie&ent King, was aiways on terms
of closest intimacy with the Earl of Rose
bery. Within ll;e last few days the King
has had a long interview with the Earl.

Lodge, ,' Knights of Pythias, which has
been in session here considering charges
of mismanagement by the board of con
trol of the endowment rank ( to-daydecid
ed that the most expedient way of meet
ing the deficiency of $500,000 of the treas
ury was to raise the insurance rate to the
maximum prescribed by the National Fra
ternal Congress. ; If in this way' money is
not quickly enough forthcoming, . it Is
likely that a special assessment of 50 cents
will be put on every member of the order
for the benefit -of the endowment rank.
This latter move would speedily raise
$250,000.
The board of control will continue to in
vestigate tho affairs of the endowment

will be taken will be the . Instituting of

There was an even harder struggle made
by men who thought it was not fair to
plaÂ£e all the financial burden of making
up the deficit caused by bad administra
tion on the policy holders. The men who
took this view pointed out that the en
dowment rank was ..incorporated in the

Knights of Pythias, and was controlled
by It. They,8ald that Hinsey-was an of
ficer appointed by the Pythian order, and
not by the policy holders, and that conse
quently the whole order should bear the
losses caused by him and that a uniform
assessment on all Pythlans should be
levied .to make it good.

Deputy Sheriff Who Killed Joseph

; Released. â¢
The Supreme--- Court- issued a writ of
habeas corpus yesterday for Fred Begre
row,/ the Santa Clara deputy sheriff, who
shot and killed Joseph Cech and August
Berger at a brewers' picnic last July.
Begerow won his freedon through fail
ure of .the authorities to institute further
action within sixty days after the dis
agreement of the trial jury.
In five consecutive trials juries have
â¢failed to convict the alleged murderer and
the opinion of the Supreme Court stated
that it was not apparent that further liti
gation would bring the affair to a settle
ment. The decision of the court practi
cally amounts to a final acciuittal, al
though it is possible that new charges
may be brought against him.
Begerow -while in an intoxicated condi
tion attempted to arrest George Schmied
of San Francis$p. Cech and Berger inter
fered and after some violent language on
their part Begerow drew his revolver and
shot them. . "The witnesses of the deed

to lynch the officer was frustrated only

THE shooting- kings ; continue to'
pour into the city on every train
and the predictions are that the
third National Bundes Shooting
Festival which will begin at Shell
Mound Parik next Sunday will be a record
breaker. Some of the best shooters In
America have arrived,, but the largest
contingents will reach this city 'to-day
and Saturday. Advices have been, re
ceived by .telegraph of parties en route
that will swell the number of participants
in the carnival beyond expectations. .
Yesterday a number of the shooters vis
ited the park and inspected the targets.
They went over the ground thoroughly
and expressed themselves highly satisfied
with all arrangements â¢ that have' been
made. The climate they describe as sur
passing all expectations and they antici
pate a royal good time during their Btay.
Tr'ps throughout the -State have been
planned. Those who are not engaged in
the carnival will depart after a few days
for interior points of interest, and after
the affair is concluded the bulk of the
party will go to Catalina Island on a
fishing jaunt. â¢ Upon their return the Yo
semite Valley will be the objective point.
Many will take the northern route return
ing home. They go via the Oregon and
California line, touching. at Mount Shasta
and stopping In Portland and other north
ern citieaT . Â¦ . , â¢
On Saturday the bulk of the members
of the bund, will arrive, as the. coming of
many of th6 prominent members has been
delayed until that day. ; Over 300 rooms
have been engaged at the Palace Hotel to
accommodate this party, as well aa 100 in
other leading hotels. A special train that
left New York City Saturday, July 6,
stopped at Chicago, Denver, Pueblo, Colo

Question of Supremacy
Supporters of Independence
Encouraged by the
Showing.
NEWPORT. R. I- July 11â The Colum
bia wen to-day's race in 5ne snap's with
the Constitution second and the. Inde
pendence a remarkable thhxl. The Boston
boat sailed an exciting rac e with the two
Herreshoff s and led the Constitution at
the outer mark, only to be Jieaten by her
a little over two minutes on the run to
the finish before the wind.
The breeze to-day was rrrach stronger
than on previous days and ilie'Independ
ence sailed the fifteen miles to windward
without her jib topsail am' .seemed trt
hold hierher. at the same time xootinsr jut.t
es fast. The result of to-day's .race leaves
the question of the- supremacy of the
three 90-footers uncertain, thfc . Independ
ence beinz not po slow after all. wnilo
the Constitution has yet to pro re Her un
questioned superiority to the other two
yachts in anything except t?ery light
winds. The hopes of the Boston contin
pt-nt. have therefore gone upwa.'d with a
bound, and to-night the experts are try-
Ing to figure what the Independ ence wi.I
<3o when it blows a little harder.
The race itself was very exciting, espe
cially when a little less than an Hour aft
er the start the Independence, by keeping
rear the Narragansett shore, foiled the
Cci stitution about and for a few minutes
was the leading boat in the race..
From that point to the turnirg point
thÂ«- fight between the two yachts was one
of the closest Been here for year i. Â« itli
the mark about eight miles dead to wind
ward, the two flyers battled for Uie lead.
Three times did the Herreshoff yacht at
tempt to cross the bow of the Crownin
ehield boat, only to be beaten back ana
forced about. Captain Han" kept the Con
stitution right under his lee and was abie
to maintain this commanding position
through the speed and footing ability ot
th* Boston boat, even with less sail, the
Herrestioff boat carrying as usual her
baby jib topsail.
On ar.d on sailed the rivals, the hull of
the Independence being always, on the
sunny side of the Bristol boat. VV hlle
they ' battled, however. Captain Barr of
the Columbia saw his chance and took
edvantsge of this contest between the
other two yachts to slip on to the wind
ward side and he thus reached the mark
nearlv four minutes ahead.
Astern of him were the Independence
and Constitution, each etriving for the
buoy the Boston boat giving blow for
blow and luff for luff in ever case and
finally swinging around with the Consti
tution's bowsprit right over tier taff rail.
Two brief Beconds after the Constitution
also turned.
On Monday the Herreshoff yacht was
forty minutes In the ten-minute beat to
the "windward mark. On the home beat
both the HerreshoST boats pulled away
from the Independence, but the gain was
comparatively small and not at all dis
couraging to the followers of the Boston
* Shrouded in a dense canopy of fog, the
Columbia swept across the finish line.
Three minutes and 42 seconds after came
the Constitution and right astern by less
than half a mile sailed the Independence,
defeated but not humiliated. The three
crews cheered each other, the Independ
ence tars being particularly demonstra
tive.

Joy on the Independence.
NEWPORT, R. I.. July 1Lâ There was
almost the joy of victory on the Indepen
dence to-night. The remarkable improve
ment in the speed qualities of the boat
has given all hands hope. Captain Haff,
who has never lost confidence, said to
day that after the Independence had been
properly tuned up she can- beat. either of
the two boats in any kind of breeze". He
further said that she has not yet been
thoroughly tried out In equal conditions.
The present series of races has so far only
afforded opportunity to find out what was
the matter. But. the captain said, since
the faults have become known there has
been no time to remedy them. All the
sails, especially the head sails, are bag
ging badly, and the sailmaker has had no
time to tighten them. An entire new eet
of head sails Is now being made. The
Independence sailed to-day with a ton less
ballast than in the other two races, and in
the absence of the jib topsail she carried
nsuch less lee helm.
There is the best of feeling and a
healthy spirit of rivalry among the crews.
Captain Barr of the Columbia dined with
Captain Haff on the Independence tender
to-nisrht.
Drennan. was the first to suffer from .the
new foul strike rule. : -.=.-;; .;/... j
Babbitt made the prettiest bunt ever
seen on the grounds. With Spies far back
he used the handle end of j the bat and
dropped the ball a foot in front of the
rubber.
In the second inning the' Dufles began
scoring. Dunleavy was safe on a hit and
made second on Kelly's error, * Francks
getting Into the running on the same play.
A double steal and a hit by Arrellanes
scored Dunleavy. Francks scored en an
cut
Youngey Johnson may have a good voice
â as far as pure, untarnished noise goes.
He may even come under the name of
pitcher at times, but what he wants to
learn and that quickly is that posing is
not baseball. It consumes time and does
the game no good. The diamond is not
the vaudeville stage.
Pete Lohman made a pretty steal from
second to third.
The irony of fate came when Hutchinson
put the ball over the right field fence on
the wrong side of the foul line and had a
strike called on him for so doing.
Lohman did a pretty piece of fake work
in the sixth. Reitz was on third and
Householder on i first. Lohman gave all
the signs and show of throwing to sec
ond when Householder left first for the
middle station. He thre\C to Johnson in
stead and Reitz was caught between third
and the plate. / â¢ --\ Â¦Â¦Â¦' .- . - ' *
Truck Eagan hit the fence underneath
the score sign for a clean two-bagger.
Drennan's catch of Hartwell's fly pro
voked a good round of hand-clapping.
Francks* fielding was fast, sharp and
brilliant.
The last play of the day was a hot liner
to Johnson, and he caught it with one
hand, doubling Householder at first.-

defeated San Francisco to-day in an
eleven-inning game by a score of 4 to 2.
Iburg and Stricklett officiated for their re
spective teams and there was little to choose
between them, as both did excellent work.
The game throughout was the most inter
esting of the season and kept the audi
ence on the jump the majority of the
time. Croll's running- catch of Courtney's
long fly, which would have been a turee
bagger, and Stricklett striking out three
irien on nine pitched balls, were the fea
tures of the came. Score:

soldiers. The cadets marched to their
camp grounds, which are about a block
from the Southern Pacific depot. On ar
riving on the ground, .sabers and coats
were laid aside and the young men fell
to work with a will. Within an hour a
number of tents were raised to shelter the
squad . for the night. Before to-morrow
evening 100 tents will be erected in mili

The men of the advance guard ate thtlr
first meal at a downtown hotel, but to

Major John Duffey of the third battalion
was to have commanded the squad, but
owing to the illness of his mother he was
unable to accompany the advance guard.
It is understood he will, however, attend
the encampment.

In the Cooks and ' Waiters' and the
Journeymen Butchers' strikes there were
no new developments yesterday. The lead
ers of the Cooks and Waiters claim that
the wholesale butchers' move in ordering
the retailers to return the union cards has
not materially changed the conditions of
the fight, further than to arouse the ani
mosity of the retailers against the whole
salers.
The Retail Butchers' Association held a
meeting last night at B'nal B'rith Hall
and adopted new by-laws and rules of or
der. Many members of the association
had received orders from the Wholesale
Butchers' Association peremptorily de
manding that the retailers refrain from
selling meat to parties who have been
blacklisted by the wholesalers and that
they not only take down the union cards,
but that they return the cards to the
Cooks and Walters' Alliance. This notice
evoked much stormy discussion.
The retailers feel that the wholesalers'
fight against the union restaurants i9
forcing great hardship upon them. They
say they are forced to bear the brunt of
the struggle without having any means
of fighting back.
The Stationary Firemen's Union held a
meeting last night at 1133 Mission street
and elected officers. They also decided to
make a demand for a charter.
Hetail Butchers Resentful.
Decisive Action Expected To-Day.
Livingston Jenks, who was present at
the employers' conference, stated in an In
terview afterward that this was the near
est approach to a settlement of the dlf
liculties that had been reached since the
inception of the strike. He said;
"We are earnestly endeavoring to ar
range for a meeting between the two par
ties, and we hope they will arrive at a
settlement. First, however, before the
employers will consent to a conference
they desire to know exactly Â¦what subjects
are to be discussed. The programme must
be outlined beforehand. I nave learned
that the Iron Trades Council has ap
pointed an. arbitration committee, and I
am going to meet with them t for the pur
pose of arranging for a regular confer
ence."
The proposed conference between Mr.
Jenks and the representatives of the Iron
Trades Council was held later in the day,
but nothing definite was accomplishd.
Preliminary measures were discussed and
arrangements were made for a meeting
to-day, when it is expected that some
thing decisive in the way of arbitration
will be effected.
The members of the Iron Trades Council
are delighted over the prospects of a
speedy termination* of the difficulties.
They regard the desire on the part of the
managers to discuss the matter with a
committee of the ironworkers as a partial
victory, considering that in the first in
stance the bosses positively refused to
recognize the local unions.
Brewerymen May Strike. -
Although there seems to be every rea
son to believe that <the machinists' strike
will soon be terminated, the end of the
strike epidemic does not yet appear to be
in sight. Recently Branches 1 and 5
of the United Brewery Workingmen's
Association submitted a contract to the
boss brewers in which they demanded an
eight-hour day. They ' based their de
mand principally on the fact that the
brewers all over the coast, excepting in
this city alone, labor but eight hours each
day. The contract was to have gone into
effect on July 15. The boss brewers paid
not the least attention to their employes"
demands, but on the other hand presented
a contract which practically bound the
workingmen to labor nine hours at a
stretch. This contract also stipulated that
the brewers should not join In a sympa
thetic strike.
This contract of the boss brewers was
submitted to Branch 1 of the United
Brewery Workingmen's Association at
the meeting last night at 1159 Mission
street. It was unanimously rejected. In
taking this decisive action, the brewers
explained that they could not possibly
adopt a nine-hour contract without en
tailing great Injury upon the members of
the other branches of the association on
the coast, who have all been granted
shorter days. The contract now will be
referred to all the branches of the United
Brewery Workingmen's Association and
to the Labor Council, and upon their ac
tion rests the possibility of a strike. It
seems to be the sentiment among the
members of Branch 1 that when the ex
isting conditions are made clear to the
boss brewers they will not insist on their
nine-hour contract.
The United Brewery Workingmen's As
sociation comprises the teamsters and
bottlers as well as the brewers. In all
they number about 600.
The managers of the Union Iron Works
also held' a meeting yesterday for the pur
pose of considering the developments to
ward conciliation. At'the conclusion of
the meeting it was definitely announced
that the employers 'were willing to dis
cuss the strike station with a committee
appointed by the Iron Trades Council
with a view toward the adjustment of the
difficulties.
All indications now clearly point to' an
early and amicable adjustment of the dif
ficulties between the .striking machinists
and their employers. Yesterday both sides
expressed themselves as being willing and
anxious to effect a final settlement
through the medium of arbitration. At a
meeting of the executive committee of the
Iron Trades Council, which was held yes
terday morning in the Emma Spreckels
building, the referendum vote by all the
machinists' unions on the question wheth
er to submit to arbitration or to continue
the strike was canvassed. \ The vote re
sulted in an emphatic declaration in favor
of arbitration. Accordingly the council
appointed a committee ot five to confer
with a committee of the employers when
such a committee shall be appointed. This
committee of the Iron Trades Council has
full power to act.
Both Sides Hope for a
Speedy End of the
Strike.

"The electric light service would\be sold
to the hotel, camps and houses situated
in the valley, and the plant would be self
supporting. Some people have suggested
that an electric road be * operated in the
valley, but the commission is. opposed to
that. In order to make the Yosemlte at
tractive to the public we must furnish a
certain amount of comfort to visitors. To
mountain climbers : and .those who "rough
it" modern hotels,., .and^inventions .are
looked upon ; askance. S IC the .xosemite is
to be made attractive we must hare cer
tain improvements. Personally I yield to
no one in my love and admiration for the
beauties of the Yosemite, and I think that
the effect of an electric searchlight on
the falls and domes would furnish re
markable and never to be forgotten views
to visitors." Â¦ .
"The commission will be pleased if the
members of the Sierra. Club will be pres
ent and give jis their views on the mat
ter. . If we Install the plant and have a
searchlight to illuminate-, the falls at night
we think it would add to the many, charm
ing scenic effects, to be found .in' the Yo
semlte. It is only natural .that opinions
should differ on the question/and for that
reason the commission desires to have
some of the Sierra Club members present
at its meeting next â¢ Monday. .
"Some of the gentlemen Â¦who are op
posed to the lighting plant, are probably
of. the opinion. that a modern hotel in the
valley is a desecration of nature. I have
even heard complaints Â¦ made, against the
telephone and telegraph wires that run
into- the valley. If we -did not have the
telephone and telegraph in the valley oth
er people would complain at being cut off
from the outer world. Complaints are be
ing made of the dusty condition of the
roads, whilp there -is a general demand
for a system of electric lighting in the
valley. For that reason we propose to in
stall a pumping and electric lighting plant.
Plans and specifications have been drawn,
and the commission will . meet next Mon
day at 1 p. m. in the offices in the Claus
Spreckels building to pass upon the mat
ter. â¢ : Â¦ ;
"The last Legislature appropriated ($25,
000 for a pumping- plant and an electric
light system in the valley.' The two sys
tems are absolutely needed. The roads
are in need of water, and we must have
a pumping plant. The hotel, houses and
stores in the valley are lighted at present
by lamps and candles.' There is danger
of fire always present by the . use of oil
lamps. The plan to Illuminate the falls
is to use a powerful electric searchlight.
We Â¦ have ' -never thought of placing arc
lights in front of the falls or on the
domes. The idea is absurd. In Europe
many of. the great falls are illuminated
by electric searchlights, and the effect of
colored lights on the falling water and
spray is artistic to a degree. :"
Attorney "W. W. Foote, one of the Yo
semlte Commissioners, in discussing the
proposed electric lighting plant for the
valley and the protest of the Sierra Club,
said yesterday: Â¦Â¦ . ' . ; Â¦ â¢
"The Sierra Club is mistaken in thinking
that- the commission intends to mar the
beauty of the valley. On the contrary,
It desires to add to the scenic effects of
nature's wonderland. A member of 1 the
club is quoted as saying that 'electric
lights for the falls and domes would be to
convert the valley into a midway plals
ance.' . .-
The members of the Sierra Club' have
placed themselves on record' as being op
posed to the Installation of an electric
light plant In the Yosemlte Valley. A com
munication has been sent by the club to
the Yosemlte Commissioners as a result of
a meeting held In the.. valley last Tuesday,
and the protest will be discussed by the
commission when it meets next Monday
In this city.

A MISTAKEN PHILOSOPHER.
WHILE the tremendous hot wave which has
raged over the East for so long a time has
been the direct or indirect cause of many
tjundreds of deaths, the most illustrious victim thus
far has been Professor John Fiske, whose death is at
tributed, according to the reports,- to "heart trouble
and heat prostration." He died at the age of 59, when,
according to those who knew him well, he should
have lived well on toward the century mark, for he
possessed an abnormally strong constitvition and was
noted for physical as well as mental vigor. ._ -
A little more than a year ago an eccentric million
aire in Chicago gave to the world an account of a sys
tem of living by which he believed men' could live for
a hundred years. It included among its specifications
the exercise of care against over-eating, over-drinking
and over-workin^rand against sudden changes of tem
perature in the atmosphere. The -publication came at
a dull season of the year, and the subject was made a
matter of general discussion. Professor Fiske, whose
abounding health and vigor were, envied by less 'â¢ for
tunate took part ' f in the; discussion and fur
nished to a friend an account of his method of Iivinsf

A Massachusetts' man has filed a claim for Chicago
property worth $250,000,000. He has either taken the

Geronimo, the aged Apache chief who has beeff
many years a prisoner of Uncle Sam, became gay on
Independence day, . exploded some cannon crackers
and . nearly created a riot. The old fellow, probably
wanted just one more suggestion of the old "rough
houfee" wnich he used to enjoy.
After duly studying the effects of the hot spell upon
the people of the East, the' Springfield Republican
says if 100 degrees in the shade were the -normal tem
perature, American civilization would disappear, like
butter, on a hot griddle. .

This is the kind of thing that happens in Phila
delphia: A stranger in the city was called upon at his
hotel by a young woman, who told him that she had
seen him on the street, was pleased with his looks and
would like to marry him. ' The stranger .saw her
father, found out that she has in her own right $40,000,
and married her. The whole romance from proposal
to marriage occupied less than three days, and yet
there are people who say that Philadelphia is slow.
.By way of cheering up the people of New ', York
the Sun of that city on one of the hottest days of the
torrid season published an account of the great bliz
zard of 1899, when many people perished in the
streets, and closed by saying, "Oh, what wouldn't
we have given then for a breath of this present
weather?"
A JUDGE in a Colorado court is reported to have
recently decided that "any enactment relative
to the sale of liquor whereby a woman is pro
hibited from purchasing liquors under the same cir
cumstances that a man is, is in violation of her rights
under the equal suffrage constitutional provision, and
is in violation of the right given a saloon-keeper to
sell to a woman as well as to a man. By that last act,
the last vestige , of inequalities . between man and
woman under the laws of the State of Colorado was
swept away." /
It will be remembered that whenever woman suffrage
is a subject of discussion the advocates of the measure
invariably assert that it would promote the cause of
temperance, because women would be sure to vote
against the saloons. It is therefore worth noting
that if the decision of this Colorado Judge be sound
the effect'of female suffrage in that State has been,
not to close saloons to men, but to open them to
women. The result may be put down as another
illustration of the truth of the old saying that it is
always the unexpected that happens; but that will not
alter the effectiveness of it, as a refutation of the tem
perance argument of the suffragists. t -
Of course it is not likely that any considerable num
ber of women in Colorado will take advantage of the
rights and privileges of saloon drinking which the
Judge says are theirs under the constitution. There is
a social law mightier than constitutions, and Mrs.
Grundy has a way of enforcing her decrees no matter
what courts may say. Still the situation is an interest
ing one, and it might add to the midsummer gayety
of the country if Mrs. Carrie Nation's attention were
drawn to it.
A COLORADO DECISION.
VICTORY IN SIGHT.
FROM the readiness with which the better ele
ments of the Republican party have rallied to the
support of the Primary League, good omens can
be drawn to cheer the party in the campaign that is to
come. In fact since the organization of clubs in the
various Assembly districts it may be said that victory
is in sight Nothing now remains but to continue the
work. If that be done with enthusiasm and vigor all
will be welL
In taking that sanguine view of the situation, The
Call does not overlook the menace of bossism that still
threatens municipal politics. The professional politi
cians with their gangs are well aware of the advantage
which an honest primary election law gives the better
elements of the party, but they are not discouraged.
It is their belief that many good citizens will rely upon
the law and neglect to go to the polls, and accordingly
they are arranging to make a fight wherever they
think they have a chance to win. Their hopes are not
altogether vain. It is certain that any falling off in the
earnestness of the better elements of the party would
in some cases be followed by victory for the bosses.
The Call, however, does not believe there will be any
diminution in the activity of the league clubs, and
consequently it counts the defeat of the gangs as a
foregone conclusion.
The one issue before genuine Republicans at this
time is to make ready for the struggle at the primaries.
To that end every member of the party should see to
it that he is properly registered, and then unite with
the league club in his Assembly district. In that way
he will keep in touch with the general movement of
the party and be well advised for what candidates to
vote at the primaries. That is a public duty to which
all Republicans should attend.
It can hardly be necessary to point out the im
portance of the primary elections. From them are to
emanate the delegates who are to make the party
nominations for the offices that are to be filled at the
coming municipal election. In times past when pri
maries were dominated by bosses, it frequently hap
pened that the party conventions nominated men
whom honest Republicans would not support. The
primary election law affords honest Republicans a
means of defeating that sort of work and assuring an
honest convention. It can no longer be said that the
primaries will be controlled by force or fraSid, and
consequently there can be no longer a good excuse
for staying away from them. The issue is now fairly
up to the better elements of the party. It is for them
to determine what the result wall be.
It was for the purpose of rousing the better elements
of all parties to a realization of the advantages con
ferred upon them by the primary law that the Repub
lican Primary League was organized. One of its chief
objects is to get all citizens to take part in the pri
maries and to support and maintain the new law by
demonstrating its usefulness in actual operation. In
addition to that general work, the league aims at pro
moting: the election of thoroughly representative men
to the Republican nominating convention, so that a
ticket may be nominated worthy of the support of all
Republicans and of all independent voters. With
those objects every genuine 'Republican can sym
pathize and can co-operate for their attainment. That
is the appeal which is now being made to the better
elements of the party, and fortunately all evidences
point to the conclusion that the appeal is being gen
erally heeded.

PERSONAL MENTION.
DESTRUCTION OP WILD FLOWERS
CIVILIZATION,' while it is doing so much to
preserve and multiplyeverythingthat is directly
useful to it, is tremendously wasteful and de
structive of many^of nature's gifts. "Even in this coun
try, where civilized man has carried on his work and
his waste for but a comparatively short time, we have
seen the virtual extermination of the buffalo and the
extinction of many a noble forest. We have also per
ceived the danger of an extinction of many of our
birds of beautiful plumage. It will therefore, be a
matter of no great surprise to intelligent men to learn
that in Great Britain the naturalists are complaining
of the' destruction of many of the wild flowers for
which rural England has been noted from immemorial
time and of which so many of her most famous poets
have sung.
It appears that since the days of Shakespeare the
flora of England has been considerably diminished,
many fine species have become exceedingly
scarce, while others have disappeared altogether. The
Westminster Gazette in reviewing the subject says:
"Several species, such as the lizard orchis, the coral
root, the'lady's slipper, the leafless Epipogum and the
Fen orchis, may soon have to be reckoned among our
extinct species. The sweet-scented sea stock is ex
tinct on the cliffs at Hastings, and is now only to be
found in the Isle of Wight. - The little Trichonema
exists only in one locality in South Devon. In former
years the rugged heights of Portland were clothed
with the tree-mallow, which also 'grew _ at Hurst
Castle. In both these localities, and indeed along the
whole of the southern coast except in . Devon and
Cornwall, this splendid plant will now be sought for
in vain. From the Isle of Wight many flowers seem
to have gone, and concerning many other, parts of
the country the same story has to be told." '
The destruction of the wild flowers is due, primarily
to the improved facilities of which
enable thousands of city people to get out into the
country on frequent holidays. To these dwellers
among streets of brick and mortar, where flowers are
luxuries for the rich, the temptation to gather wild
flowers when they go to the. country is irresistible.
They pull them by the thousands and drag up many
by. the roots in the hope of being able to grow them
in pots at home. The loveliest flowers very naturally
are the first to be destroyed. It is said that even the
golden; daffodil. 1 and wild snowdrop that were for
merly so profuse are now in danger of extinction.
Many a year will pass before the wild flowers of
California are in danger of extinction, but nevertheless
this new proof of the waste of civilization is worth
noting. It recalls the rapidity with which our forests
are being wasted, and helps to impress the lesson
of forest preservation while we have yet' a great for
est domain to preserve.
A statistician figures it up that the gifts to Ameri
can universities announced during the recent com
mencements reached a total of $12,817,000. If that
sort of thing keeps on the universities will eventually
own the country, and be rich enough to hire the
Morgans and Rockefellers to work for them.

OEEGONIAN ANTICS.
WE seem to have offended the Portland Ore
goniaiv and it has become pustular in its
Â¦temper toward The Call and all things Cali
fornian. We were not aware that the Oregonian con
sidered Oregon, such a wallflower among the States
that she gets- green-eyed when the beau of the ball
danced with California. â¢
Mr. Scott, who "edits, owns, inspires, guides and
fashions the Oregonian, should not bite his, thumb at
California, nor say bad things about The Call because
we think well of this State. He should not let his
temper go oft in a w.iy to disturb the cordial relations
between- the two States. If we are not all he could
wish us to be let him remember that all things are
accomplished by growth, and by what is to-day none
can judge of what may be to-morrow.
When Mr. Scott was spending all he had in live
stock over in Clackamas County, he could not look
forward with prophetic vision and see himself now, the
Tycoon of Oregon, and censor morurrrof the Pacific
Coast His personality has suppressed the Oregon as
a figure, and the familiar, lines of the great threnody
are now read:
.AVhere rolls the. Oregonian
And hears no sound,
Save its own gnashings.
Journalistic peace has been broken, and grim-vis
aged war has taken its place, because we said the
Grecian climate of California would produce here the
Greek genius. To this Mr. Scott objects. Why?
Does he expect an Attic development on the Willan;
ette? While the future legend and vignette of Cali
fornia may be Venus rising frofK the sea, that of
Oregon may be a duck sitting under an umbrella.
Even now Editor Scott is dampened to his marrow by
the clammy moisture which prevents the Attic salt
from getting through the holes in the' shaker. His
editorial utterances have come to closely resemble the
angry hiss of an old gander guarding his brood of
green goslings. .
Why does he object to Greeks and Greek art in
California? No one down here is in an agony of
jealousy because of any of the gifts and graces of
Oregon. From the dusty banks of the Malheur to the
moldy borders of the Columbia, where the air smells
of a mixture of sage brush and alkali and the contents
of the dustpan are used to make saleratus biscuit, there
is much picturesque misery in Oregon. But rising
above the plain of wet distress towers the form of
Editor Scott, like Rooster Rock above the surging
Columbia, or the tri-faced figure of Satan. over the
thick ice of the ninth circle of the tenth hell in Dante's
Inferno; and like that diabolical image, chewing an
offender in each of its mouths.
Just now he has California in each of his three jaws
and the champing is like the noise in Governor Pen
noyer's sawmill. The scene is attractive to the Greek
intellect of California merely as an artistic suggestion.
Here where "the tints of the earth and the hues of the
sky, in color though varied, in beauty may vie," it is a
relief sometimes to turn for the pleasures of contrast
to such a scene of terror and of tribulation. But re
cently this Oregon Wallapus was fanging President
McKinley for devotion to his sick wife, and now is
tapering off on The Call and California. . May the gods
of Olympus get him and Charon cool him off in the
Styx by towing his inflamed ghost astern of his ferry
boat.
It was made public at the. time and was widely com
mented on, because'; of. its marked variance from "the
rules which are. ordinarily supposed to be conducive
to health and long life. /
'Since his death Â£he account given by Mr. Fiske has
been republished and makes interesting reading. It
runs this: "Always sit in a draft when I find one,
wear the thinnest clothes I can find, winter, and sum
mer, catch cold once in three and four years*but not
severely, and prefer to work in a cold room, 55 to 60
degrees. Work the larger part of each twenty-four
hours, and by day or night indifferently. '.'/ Scarcely
ever change a word once- written, eat when hungry,
rarely taste coffee or wine or smoke a cigar,' but drink
two or three quarts of beer each day and smoke a pipe
all the. time when at work. Never experienced the
feeling of disinclination for work, and} therefore, never
had to force work. If I feel dull when at work, a half
hour at the piano restores, normal mental condition,
which is one more argument for the hygienic and re
cuperative effects of music." f
A life of that kind could be lived only by persons
endowed like Mr. Fiske with exfraordinary vigor, and
we now perceive that even for such men it is not safe.
Many a man much weaker than the great philosopher
will live longer than he simply by living more wisely.
Doubtless Mr. Fiske and his friends would have
laughed in scorn had any one suggested that the Chi
cago pork packer was a wiser philosopher than Mr.
Fiske, and had a clearer brain for the understanding of
life problems, but such seems to have been the fact. It
will not profit any man to over eat, or over drink, or
over work or take liberties with the conditions of the
atmosphere.

however, it has meant a fortune to the

thing is that it was all made out of her
savings of $2000, that sum invested in
Union Pacific having been the starting
point of a fortune of ; two-thirds the
amount, or $500,000, while a subsequent in

GOSSIP FROM
LONDON WORLD
OF LETTERS
Editor Call: In your editorial column to
day, under the head of "That Tribute to
Realty." you attempt to demolish the
single tax theory. As a single taxer and
a subscriber to your paper for many
years, and particularly as I am honestly
devoted to the single tax, will you kindly
give me a little space in your valuable
paper to show if i can where you axe
mistaken? -
I will assume that your statement re
garding the great fortune of Andrew Car
negie is correct. Three hundred millions
in stocks, you say, not money, but stocks.
These stocks are supported and held up
by a monopoly of natural opportunities
land. The trusts which have Issued the
stocks held by Mr. Carnegie ,own Im
mense quantities of land. Some of this
land is used from which to produce
wealth, but the greater part of the land
Is held Idle â out of use. To have a
monopoly of the lands which produce coal
and iron is absolutely necessary to create
such a fortune as is represented by thÂ»
stocks held by Mr. Carnegie.
Mr. Carnegie's stocks are neither money
nor wealth and depend altogether upon
the continuance of the monopoly of lands
which created them for their value, there
fore if the monopoly of the land was de
stroyed, which would be done by the ap
plication of the single lax, the value of
Mr. Carnegie's stocks would disappear al
together. Mr. Carnegie evidently under
stands what would happen to his stocks,
or he would take your view, Mr. Editor,
and would have all the burdens of taxa
tion placed upon land values. But Mr.
Carnegie knows better; he knows that If
the stocks are taxed ho can shift the tax
upon the consumer of the goods produced j
by the trust whose stock he nold3 and thafV
if the land value alone is taxed monopoly
will disappear and he will have no stocks
worth taxing. You cannot fool Mr. Car
negie.
It is strange indeed that the men. who,
as you intimate, would be advantaged by
the single tax, should all without excep
tion be bitterly opposed to the single tax.
Probably we can attribute it to their
great patriotism.

preferred to spend his life chiefly at his
villa in beautifully situated Sorrento, on
the bay, opposite Naples.

visit has entered into his soul, so that the
banks of the Thames may yet prove a
rival to the picturesque Italian village
where he has lived so long.

zig. 1752-1529." if
The contents will include extracts from
his correspondence with Goethe. Schiller.
Klopstock, Wieland, Korner and many
other leading authors and men cf letters
of that time.
Â¦ Another of Mr. Murray's autumn publi
cations will be a new epic poem by Sir
Edwin Arnold entitled "The Voyage of
Ithobal." ThTs is dedicated to Lady Ar
nold, and deals first wltn the circumnav
igation of Africa by the Phoenicians, al
luded to by Herodotus. The poem la di
vided into seven cantos, corresponding
with seven days, during which Ithobal of
Tyre relates his adventures to the King;
At the outset the hero undertakes to ex
plore unknown countries beyond the Red,
Sea. In the market at Tyre he purchases
an African princess, to whom the mys
tical secret of the "Dark Continent" is
known, and having built three ships at
Suez sets out on his exploration, accom
panied by the princess. Ithobal enjoyed
many adventures by land and sea, and
not the least exciting wa3 the mutiny of
his men.

Chief Food Inspector Brown claims to
have discovered that the milk dairies are
supplying two qualities of milk to the In
habitants of this city. Brown says that
the people living south of Market street
and in the poorer sections are supplied
with inferior milk, while their more for
tunate brethren in the aristocratic neigh
borhoods receive a better grade of the
lacteal fluid for the same money. When
a driver was pressed for a reason for this
apparent discrimination, he informed
Brown that the people south of Market
street did not know the difference. Brown
says the practice is an outrage and he
will deal summarily with the milkmen
who put water in their milk.

A. little woman dressed in black an-3
leading a pretty" golden haired child by
the hand arrived at the ferry on the Ore
gon express from Portland yesterday
morning-. She approached Policeman
O'Callahan and asked his advice as to
what she should do with the child. She
said her. nam^was Miss Frances Moxley
of Lewiston, Idaho, where her brother Is
a druggist, and that while at the railroad
depot in Portland, on her way here tho
matron, Mrs. Niles, whom she knew,, in
troduced her to two young women.
One of the young women asked
her if she would take the child v to ' this
city, where some one would be in wait
ing to take charge of it. The woman of
fered her $5 for her, trouble, and she con
sented. '
The woman gave her a card reading,
"Aiiss Henlon, 415 Oregonlan building,'
and a postal card on which was type
written: "To whom it may concern: My
ncme is Olive Christine Peerless. I am
going to a lady, Mrs. Q. B. Henion, 437
Elm avenue, Pasadena, Cal., who is- to be
my grandma. She will meet me at Los
Angeles. She will know me by my blue
sunbohnet."
Miss Moxley said she told the woman
she would stop at the Arlington Hotel
here and for her to wire to Pasadena to
that effect, so that the child would be
claimed at the hotel.
O'Callaghan referred the case to Ser
geant' Mahoney, who instructed the offi
cer to take her and the child to Captain
Seymour. The captain sent for Officer
McMurray of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children, and he took
Miss Moxley and the child to the Arling
ton Hotel, but no one had made any In
quiry there about them. Meantime Cap
tain Seymour telephoned to the Marshal
at Pasadena, and was Informed that Mrs.
Henion lived there and wanted the child
sent on in charge of the conductor of the
train to Los Angeles. She had agreed to
adopt the child. .
McMurray was then instructed to bring
the child to the City Prison, where she
will be kept till some arrangements can
be made to send her . to " Lob Angeles.
There is a little basket of clothing be
longing to the child, which Is of good
quality, and the child seems to have been
associated with refined people. She is shy
and the only thing that could be got out
of her was that she had lived at 1435
Fourth avenue, but she did not know the
name of the city. A pair of her shoea
bore the name of a Seattle firm. Â¦
She. Is Only Four Years of
Age and Is on Her Way v
to Pasadena.

THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Ventura sailed for Sydney, N. S.
W\, via Honolulu, Pago Pago and
Auckland, on time yesterday
morning. In order to get. the mall
boat away according to schedule the clev
erest piece of work ever attempted on the
coast, considering the conditions, had to
be accomplished.
The Ventura arrived here from Austra
lia on June 11 last with her low-pressure
cylinder disabled. A new cylinder was
ordered from the Cramps in Philadelphia,
and Mr. Spreckels determined to put the
ship is perfect order before sending her
to sea again. It was found, however, that
to wait for a new cylinder to come from
the East would mean detaining the mail
beat in pert a couple of months. At this
juncture the Risdon Iron Works took hold
of the job and by working all its heads of
departments night and day the -repairs
were made. A new low-pressure line\ was
cast, turned and bored in place with elec
tric motor power. All the light pistons
were taken out and heavier ones put in.
While the liner was being bored the men
were working nigrht and day niaking the
connections and joints, and finally at 8
o'clock yesterday morning the engines
were turned over and found to work per
fectly. At 10 a. m. the steamship sailed
for Australia. The Ventura is now in per
fect condition and in the future will give
a good account of herself.
r ihe mx.rine corps of the Risdon are all
licensed chief engineers as well as compe
tent mechanics. On the Ventura job they
were assisted by Engineers Horgan and
Flynn of the steamship Alameda and a
few apprentice boys only.
W. N. Conger, son of the United States
Minister to China, boarded the Ventura a
few minutes before sailing time. He will
stop over at Honolulu for a short time
and then continue his journey to Peking.
The following is a complete list of the

HERE are fortunes In store for
I . the growers 'of California lemons
I if the hot weather In the Eastern
â¢ JJL States continues. Under the
: stimulus of the climbing ther
mometers in the great Middle West there
has-been, supposedly, a greater demand
for cooling drinks, seasoned with lemon
juice, than at any time in the memory of
the oldest inhabitant. The sultry season
has swept with terrific force down, upon
the blue grass region, and the smoldering
heat of the soil of the towns and cities all
along the banks of the Missouri River and
farther east has inspired men to a grand
thirst, and to unparalleled attempts to get
rid of it. Hence the supply of California
lemons at places as remote from one an
other as Omaha, "Wichita, Louisville and
Denver has run low, and the price has
gone correspondingly high. Anthentto Â¦&â¢
vices are that there had been an advance
per box In the price of lemony In thesa
places of SI 25 In the last 'fortnlg-ht, ot
since the terrific spell of hot weather be
gan. Purchasers have gladly paid $4 per
box for what they could have obtained
for $2 75 less than a month ago.
As yet, so it Is reported by Porter
Brothers, who handle many lemons if}
trade, there has been no marked advance
in prices in San Francisco.
Creates an Increased Demand Throughout the East fop
the Fruit Raised in This State.

KEWTORK, Jnly U.â Wall street had an
other paroxysm of nervousness to-day and
madÂ« some deep cuts in the prices of stocks
before equanimity had been restored. There.
Â¦were various causes assigned for the spasm of
liquidation, including some that were palpably
eurmiaed or the result of the Interested efforts
of bear traders to increase the fright of se
curity holders. Broadly considered, the selling
came from large speculators, who had accu
mulated stocks or had held on to them from
a. long- anterior date, in the hope of realizing
on the mid-July demand, which sometimes fol
lows tbe July <lisburBcments and the reflux of
funds from the interior to New York before
they are needed for moving the crops. That
some unexpected developments have helped to
discourage this new buying and even to Induce
Felling Is evident, but the underlying cause of
the selling is the Indisposition of the New York
banks to foster a speculative movement at this
time. In view of the exigencies of the money
market, which promise to come into force ear
lier than usual this fall. The damage undoubt
edly done to the corn crop and the threat of
more to come was a potent influence. The ac
tion of the corn market itself Induced a feel-
Ing In Wall etreet that the crop situation had
been overdiscounted in the week's stock mar
iet. Tbe feeling gained ground that technical
causes would have to be looked to for an ex
planation of the force of the selling move
ment.- This left tbe way open for many ven
turesome purmises as to the concealed causes
of the notable liquidation going on. One of
theoe was that discord had broken out afresh
over the control of the Northern Pacific Facts
cited to corroborate this were several. The
Northern Pacific directors. It was pointed out,
had met and adjourned yesterday without an
nouncing the p*r*onality of the new compro
mleo board. Sensational reports were current
of a Btormy meeting between the two principals
In the Northern Pacific contest. Attention was
called to the divergent policy of the banks rep
resenting the two contending Interests, the onn
Elde calling loans freely on Monday, while
call loan ratf3 were rising, and the other side
coming to the relief of the market by lend
fng millions and lowering the rate. The sen
sational drop In Rock Island caused a conjec
ture that the possession of recently acquired
holdings in that property had to do with the
drastic liquidation In other parts of the lift.
The liquidation Fpent ltÂ« greatest force during
the first hour, when half a million shares were
t^marketed* A tendency toward recovery then
developed -which carrl<Â»<l prices daring the last
hour to an average level near to or above that
of last night. The recovery, however, was not
held and. the closing was unsettled an.1 irrjre
ular, with renewed declines In some of the
yrlaclpal active stocks. Rock Island reached a

some realizing on the break in coarse grains,
but as an offset to this there were country
orders to buy everything. Topeka wired con

farmers less disposed to sell and wheat being
bought for feed. France's minimum' Import

LOCAL MARKETS.
CHICAGO, July 11.â Wheat exhibited' more
activity than of late and the opening was
steady and slightly higher, mostly in sympathy
with strength in corn and oats, although cables
were somewhat of a factor. The feature to the
trading was the covering by shorts. There was
also a good foreign demand. September opened
\ic lower to >,ic higher at 64%@65c. Firmness
prevailed during the first half of the session
and there was an advance to 65%c, but toward
the close the market weakened and the close
was at C5%c, a gain of %c.
Corn opened active and higher with a big
early demand for country account, coupled with
general local buying on continued reports of
damage by heat. The Government crop report
was 'considered a bull factor, although it did
not contain statistics for the past ten days,
during which time it is conceded the most
damage has been done to the growing grain.
Later in the day heavy liquidation caused a
slightly weaker feeling and traders became
wary, not knowing whether to take on more
holdings or let go of what they had. September
closed with a gain of 1%@1%c at 51%@61%c. ,
Oats were again only second to corn In
strength and volume of trading. The country
was again active on the buying side and there
was some replacing of lines by local longs. Sep
tember closed at 31%c, with a gain of %c.
. Provisions opened with a rush, but as It
proved, at the highest point of the day. The
feature to the trade was the scarcity of offer
ings. There was a fair outside demand, but
local packers easily led In the buying on the
soft spots. Strength in corn was a bull factor.
September pork- closed 5c higher, lard ' un
changed and ribs 2^2@5c higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
. Business -was quieter again on the morning
session of the Bond Exchange, with a decline in
i Spring Valley Water to J8S& and in Hutchlnson
Sugar to $17%. There was no change in the
oil stocks.
In the afternoon Alaska Packers was higher
at $133. Spring Valley Water still lower at
$86 and Honokaa lower at $19@18^.

CLOSING.
Yesterday's rally proved to be a flash In the
pan. The universal decline was resumed to
day under the lead of American stocks. The
New York monetary position Is disliked here
and there is a fear that Germany will take
gold from London. Americans opened depressed
and the market rushed to sell, although com
mitments here were light., Germany sold 50.000
shares and close to the bottom. There was
also selling for the New York account. Atch
ison was >most erratic, fluctuating from SO to
75 and finally recovering. The consol payment
is passing oft easily. The market price of par
gold has risen a farthing to 77s 9V4d. Money
to-day was harder, the call rate running up to
2 per cent.

DECIDUOUS FRUITS.
Two cars of Watermelons from Fresno were
held at 17c, but were too green for the trade.
One was sent down to San Jose, where It
was turned down on this account. A crate of
Nutmsgs came in from Clarksburg, on the
Sacramento River, and sold at $2 25. Canta
loupes brought good prices.
The Panama steamer brought up 269 cases
Limes, but the price has nevertheless advanced,
as will be seen. Oranges are flat and nominal,
and Lemons are unchanged.
Prices for Peaches, Pears and Plums are ad
vancing under moderate arrivals and a good
demand. Figs are lower. Berries are still
cheap and show little change. There are not
many Apricots on the market now, and fine
Peaches are scarce. Nectarines are steady at
the good prices.
The recent arrivals of Bananas are rather
green, but they are selling off well at the
quotations.

SACRAMENTO, July 11.â As a result of
the disclosures of the alleged official mis
conduct of State Gardener Dunn, the Cap
itol Commissioners to-day dismissed him
from the State service and appointed
John C. Scroggs of Sacramento in his
place. The Important incident of the
meeting was the introduction of a caustic
resolution by Governor Gage denouncing
the acts of Dunn and referring his case
to the Attorney General for action. The
resolution declares that the present Capi
tol Commissioners were induced by cer
tain high officials and by both Governors
Markham and Budd to retain Dunn, they
representing that he was an honest man
and an accomplished gardener. The reso
lution then calls for Dunn's dismissal and
the reference of his case to the Attorney
General for such steps as # the law de

It has been found that Professor George
C. Tilden, the noted mineralogist, who
was recently brought to this city from
San Salvador suffering from nervous col
lapse due to overwork at his profession,
is probably a hopeless maniac. Professor
Tilden, who Is a nephew of the late Sam
uel J. Tilden of New York and a noted
scientist, reached San Francisco on June
30 and was at once taken by his friends
to a private asylum. In the hope that he
would soon get better. He grew worse In
stead, and yesterday Flora Atkinson, the
keeper of the private sanitarium, had him
conveyed to the detention ward of the
City Receiving Hospital, as she was un- â¢
able to do anything with him. He spent
last night strapped to his bunk, raving
constantly, and to-day will be examined
for commitment to an asylum.

SAN JOSE, July 11.â The love esca
pades of Ethel "Waterhouse and Percy
Lovejoy, which created such a sensation
at Mountain View a year ago, were re
called to-day by an action to compel him
to support their child In Justice "Wallace's
court. The young people were social fa
vorites in their home town, and it was
understood they were to be married. Just
before the date fixed Waterhouse fled to
Oregon and a scandal followed. He was
arrested there and brought back to keep
his promise of marriage.
While the examination was In progress
here Lovejoy and Miss Waterhouse left
the courtroom and got married. That
quashed the case against him. Lovejoy's
parents then denounced him and told him
never to come home again.
To-day's action was on a charge of fail
ing to provide for the support of their In
fant child preferred by Mrs. Lovejov.
Ivovejoy claimed to-day he had been un
able to find remunerative work and had
been sick. The charge against him was
dismissed.

SALT LAKE, Utah, July 11.â Judge Hall
of the United States District Court to-day
rendered his decision In the celebrated
Hilton-Park case, the court holding that
the ceremony of "sealing" performed in
1872 was purely a religious ceremony af
fecting the lives of Mrs. Hilton and Dr.
Park only In the hereafter and was not a
marriage ceremony known to or recog
nized by the laws of Utah. Mrs. Hilton,
claiming by this ceremony to be a widow
of Dr. Park, had sued for part of the es
tate.
It is Mormon Church doctrine that a
woman dying out of the marriage state
does not occupy so high a plane in heaven
as a woman who has been married. In
1872 Miss Armltage, afterward Mrs. Hil
ton was believed to be dying, and in or
der to add to her happiness in the here
after. Dr. John R. Parks, a friend of some
years' standing, was called to the appar
ently dying woman's bedside and the cere
mony of "sealing" for eternity was pro
nounced over them by President Wells.
It was stated In the certificate issued by
President Wells that Miss Armitage was
sunposed to be on her death bed. .
The court holds, therefore, that as the
ceremony was performed only to provide
for the woman's spiritual welfare in the
next world. Miss Armitage and Dr. Park
were never h'.isband and wife. .

"Sealing" Is Decided

To permit the valuation of said franchise for
taxable purposes to be higher than $1,732,079
wujld be unfair and unjust, even though the
ordinance In the premises is belns contested,
in view of the proceeding's and remarks made
Â¦ by the board prior to the time when it
claimed to flx water rates.
The HIbernIa Savings and Loan Society
also protested against an assessment of
$5000 on Its franchise, $150,000 on a solvent
credit, consisting- â¢ of a United States
check, and $2^,000 on loans outside of
California. It is claimed that the society
has no capital stock, nor has the fran
chise any pecuniary value; Â¦ that the.
United States check should not be as-
sessed, as it is a draft drawn by the
United States Treasurer in payment of
interest due petitioner upon certain regis
tered bonds, and Is exempt from taxation
under section 3701 of the Revised Statutes;
that the item "loans outside the State"
is pot a taxable credit, as the loans are
secured by mortgages on real propeity. â¢
WANT THEIR FRANCHISE
ASSESSMENTS CANCELED
Whether or not the trust clause in the
famous Fair will, which was declared in
valid, affects tho distribution of the per
sonal property is the question that Judge
Troutt Is to decide within a few days.
Upon his decision rests the distribution of
an accumulated Income, a considerable
portion of which is to go to the lawyers
who have had dealings with the courts
by reason of the desire of many heirs to
handle the millions of the late Senator.
Judge Haynes argued for four hours
yesterday morning and sought to prove
that realty and personal property dis
tributed through a trust clause could be
segregated. He argued that the distribu
tion of tfie realty did not necessarily
mean that the personal property should
be distributed. His argument was an
swered by Attorney C. S. Wheeler, who
contended that segregation was not pos
sible under existing circumstances.
Mr. Wheeler contended that the late
Senator intended that the income from
the property should go to his children, as
has the property from -which the income
was derived. Many cases -were cited by
Wheeler to prove his claim, particularly
a decision which provided that "where the
gift of a residue is dependent for its as
certainment upon a prior trust, which has
been declared" invalid, the whole gift Is
void."
The afternoon session was devoted to
the arguments of Charles Pence, repre
senting Fair's alleged widow, and G. E.
Crothers.
Pence reviewed the late Senator's will
and submitted figures showing that if the
Income from the estate was allowed to
accumulate in fifty years' time more than
170,000,000 would be saved. This, he
claimed, was rot the object of the late
Senator. â¢ Â¦
Attorney Crothers devoted the time al
lowed him to a discussion of the inten
tions of Senator Fair. He touched upon
the amount of coin received by the law
yers, and was interrupted by ex-Governor
Budd. who represents the Fair children.
Mr. Bud told Crothers very forcibly
that "it was none of his business what
they received." Â¦ - Â¦ â¢
Judge Troutt adjourned court at 4
o'clock, and will continue the hearing at
10 a. m. to-day.

FAIR LAWYERS
STILL WRANGLE
In granting a writ of habeas corpus for
Hei.ry Pfirrmann of Los Angeles the Su
preme Court yesterday admitted the ex
istence of a question which vitally affects
the licensing power of every county in
California.
Pfirnaann is a liquor dealer In Los An
geles. In the spring of the current year
fce purchased a saloon from August Lep
perctt end engaged In business under the
firm name of Pflrrnann & Baumgarten.
On June 27 h<Â» paid a city license tax of
$50. An attempt was then made to com
pel Mm to pay a county tax of $15 per
month. On legal advice, he declined to
make rarracnt. and was finally impris
oned by the county authorities on June 77.
A petition for a writ of habeas corpus was
filed with th? Superior Court and was de
nied. Pfirrmann then appealed to the Su
preme Court.
The Stato law in question, which was
I>asred at the last session of the Legisla
ture is in part as follows:
Boards of supervisors of the counties of the
Ftate. and it"-* legislative bodies of the Incorpo
rated cities and towns j therein, shall. In the
exercise of their police powers, and for the
purpose of reputation, as herein provided, and
not otherwise, have power to license all and
'very kind of business net prohibited by law.
â¢ nd transacts and carried on within the limits ,
of their respective jurisdictions, and all shows, :
exhibitions snd lawful fames carried on there
in, to fix the license rates of tax upon the
rame and to provide for the collection of the
same by suit or otherwise. â¢ â¢ â¢
Pfirraann in his petition recites at
length the ordinances of Los Angeles
which govern iiouor selling and shows
that h's business is 5f>Â«rally reflated by
the municipal lavs. The legislative en
actment states that the licensing power
shall bo used -"fcr the purpose of regula
tion, rtc. and not otherwise." Hence he
claim? that the county has no right to
Impose a lirv>nse on thÂ«Â» same business,
for which he has already paid all that
the law rcq-jirpp to the city.
The Supreme Court admits the plea and
Elves the Los Angeles County authorities
or.f ; wc"c-k in which to show that the law â¢
means something different from what it
fays. j
Chief Justice Uratty says In his opinion
that there is apparently no other inter
pretation to the law than that counties
ir>r.st lose their revenue from liquor sell
ing. All towns in the State theoretically
DSP their license revenue for "the pur
pose of regulation." Counties also draw
a license revenue, but the towns have
already made their regulations, so the
funds received by the former are appar
ently rot derived in accordance with the
law. In the case of San Francisco, where
city and cour.ty are incorporate, an Inter
' rating legal point is involved as to wheth
er the city revenue is used for county pur
poses or vice versa.

. Growers' Association convention, was oc
cupied With addresses by Governor Rich
ards, President Springer, of the National
Livestock Association, Prof a. Foster and
Nelson of the 'Wyoming University, Sec
retary Snow of the' State Board of Sheep
Commissioners, Hon. B. B. Brooks, Hon.
C. W. Burdick and others.
President Springer took an optimistic
view of the livestock Industry, which was
never in, a more prosperous condition than
now. He urged the election of members
to Congress who will be favorable to the
greatest of all industries, the growing of
livestock. He said that Secretary of
Agriculture Wilson had acceded; to the
wish of the association and would main
tain a livestock statistical bureau, statis
tics.to be gathered semi-annually. He also
said that the association would urge the
passage of a bill at the next session of
Congress compelling manufacturers to tag
all clothing so as to show the percentage
of shoddy, material.
Governor Richards showed that It Is
not only possible to run sheep and cattle
together, but it is also more profitable
than conducting the two industries sep
arately. He said that the Idea that sheep
ruin a range is a mistake and cited many
instances where sheep grazing had Im
proved the range 50 per cent. â¢

Be in a Prosperous -

URGE NEW LAWS
The funeral of the late Paul Neumann
held yesterday afternoon under the aus
pices of the Masonic fraternity was one
of the largest ever seen in Honolulu. Flags
â¢were at half-mast on, the Government
building and the : entire community took
part in the obsequies. The United States
District Court, the Supreme Court and
all other courts adjourned for the day on
hearing of Neumann's death and in the
United States District Court a commit
tee of the. Hawaiian Bar Association pre
sented resolutions. Judge Estee delivered
an eloquent eulogy on the deceasd. Act
ing Govrnor Cooper and Attorney General
Dole also addressed the court, paying trib
utes to the dead lawyer.
The perjury charge against Editor Wal
ter G. Smith was dismissed to-day at the
irlstance of the prosecution. Attorney
General Dole entered a nolle prosequi . in
Judge Gear's court, declaring that there
was no evidence to warrant the supposi
tion that a jury would convict. Smith was
indicted by the recent Grand Jury on ac
count of testimony he gave regarding al
leged attempts to secure bribes from leg
islators for their support of a franchise
for a railroad' in Hawaii. Smith testified
that he did not know of any corporation
that had been asked for bribes, though
he had previously testified that he knew of
such a circumstance. The attorney gen
eral stated to the court that he had in
vestigated the- matter tmct found that the
railroad company in question was not in
corporated. This fact made Smith's testi
mony that he knew of no corporation that
had been asked for bribes correct.

It was ascertained that the burglar had
used a ladder in the yard of Phillip Ans
pacher, which adjoins the Lowry resi
dence, to climb over the fence into the
Lowry yard. A window had been left
open in the layatory, through which the
burglar obtained an entrance to the
house. The door of the lavatory was
locked, but the burglar bored holes
through the door near the lock and suc
ceeded in opening the door. The rest was
easy.
.The burglar who Is known to the police
as "the borer," and who has been suc
cessfully operating in the "Western Addi

heard from again after about two weeks'
rest since he entered the residence of Dr.
Bruguiere, 1800 Franklin street, and stole
a considerable quantity of silverware. He
will take nothing but silver, which is one
of the features that mystifies the police.
Early yesterday morning the burglar
made his way into the residence of W. G.
Lowry, commission merchant, at* 2602 Pa
cific avenue. He took away with him six
silver tablespoons, six silver teaspoons
and six silver forks. Some were marked
"G. M. .L."\md others "H. M." Nothing
else was touched, although there was a
lot of silver-plated ware and Jewelry that
he could have carried off easily.
The family Is in the country and the
only occupant of the house is Thomas W
Mulford, Mrs. Lowry's father. He re
tired about midnight and at 5 o'clock in
the morning discovered that the burglar
had been in the house. The burglar had
left the stub of a cigar which he had evi
dently been smoking while selecting the
silverware. ' . I

BORER BURGLAR
AGAIN AT WORK
Many Influential and active anti-boss
Republicans visited the headquarters of
the Primary League, 93d Market street,
last evening to express their satisfaction
over the establishment of district clubs.
The league is now organized and'equipped
to put the' bosses out of business. The
meetings "Wednesday night were largely
attended and the enrollment gives assur
ance that the best citizens of San Fran
cisco have resolved y l6 give their atten
tion to primary election duties. The
bosses: are already exhibiting signs of
alarm and demoralization. Efforts to or
ganize forces to resist the Republican
Primary League were put forward last
night, but failure was the result. The
slim attendance and lack of enthusiasm
added to -the discouragement of the bos^
followers.
The clubs organized under the auspices
of the *Republican Primary League can bo
counted on to put in the field delegate
tickets representing the best citizenship of
San Francisco, and it is therefore the duty
of Republicans to enroll and take an ac
tive interest in the campaign for good
government. Citizens who pay the taxes
to maintain the city government can take
charge of local affairs if they desire. The
only chance left for the bosses is the fail
ure of good citizens to attend the primary
election. â¢
Twenty-Eighth District.
In the Twenty-eighth Assembly district,
where the bosses are strongly intrenched,
the club organized under the banner- of

Republican citizens of the boss-ridden dis
trict are eager for the contest and con
fident of success at the primary election.
A victory for good government in the
Twenty-eighth district would be a triumph
of great significance. The Anti-Boss Club
of the district met at 323 First street last
night. M. M. Foote, vice president, pre
sided. Secretary F. J. Hopper and oth
ers addressed the meeting. The attend
ance was large and the enthusiasm in
spiring. The club adopted the following
preamble and resolutions: -
Whereas, An honest primary and a free con
vention have been heretofore unknown to the
voters of this Twenty-eighth Assembly District;
and.
Whereas. Many of , the most reputable citi
zens thereof have heretofore not dared to at
tend primary elections or political meetings for
fear of bodily harm or from disgust at the
rough criminal methods used by the so-called
"bosses" of'the district and their unprincipled

"Whereas, By the enactment of the new pri

THE Dernocra-tlo City and County
Committee m*t In R B. Hall last
night and adopted resolutions ap
portioning the delegates to be
elected from the Assembly dis
tricts at thÂ« primary election to be held
August 13. TheÂ» meeting was presided
over by Jasper McDonald, with Thomas
"VT. Hlckey at the secretary's desk.
J. D. Maxwell of tne Twenty-eighth
Assembly District introduced the resolu
tion apportioning the delegates. It could
not be determined from the tone of the in
strument whether the delegates were to
be elected from primary or Assembly dis
tricts, and S. Braunhart moved to amend
the document so as to provide for the
election of the delegates by primary dis
tricts.
Mr. Braunhart's motion caused a
lengthy discussion. S. M. Van Wyck of
the Fortieth district favored electing the
delegates from Assembly districts, giving
as his reason that in his district voters
were not acquainted with one another and
City Lawyers Take Up
the Project With
Enthusiasm.
The committee of the Bar Association
having In charge the matter of the erec
tion of a statue to the memory of the late
Hall McAllister, has met with enthusias
tic encouragement for the project among
members of the legal fraternity. The com
mittee is made up as follows:
Chief Justice "W. H. Beatty. Justice Garoutte.
Justice T. I>. McFarland. Justice F. Henshaw,
W. F. Herrin, John Garber, T. B. Bishop. Hon.

The committee has been at work but a
very short time. In effect It has not. as
yet. tried very hard to secure subscrip
tions and yet $1000 has already been raised,
which Is one-fifth of the whole sum re
quired. The plan of the committee is to
erect a life-si/ed statue of the eminent
advocate in bronze. The location of the
memorial statue has not been definitely
determined upon, but it is thought there
Â¦will be no difficulty in securing the con
tent of the Park Commissioners, who have
Jurisdiction in the premises, to the erec
tion of tfco statue in front of the City
Hall and facing the street that was named
for McAllister.
All the lawyers who have been inter
viewed on the subject have warmly in
dorsed this suggestion. The subscrip

The "whole amount necessary to be

The programme de-vised by Gavin Me-
Nab, the autocrat of the Democrats, was
executed to the letter. As foreshadowed
by The Call, everything was carried out
according to prearranged plans. When
the proper time comes Mr. McNab will
nominate the municipal ticket and Demo
crats will fall into line under his banner.
Resolved. That the Democratic City and
County Committee, in meeting held July 11,
1901, hereby fixes the following apportionment
as the apportion of delegates to be elected at
a primary election to be held August 13, 1901,
the said election being held for the purpose of
electing delegates to the Democratic Municipal
Convention to be held at a date to be fixed
hereafter: be it further
that tho establishment of so many fields
of contest as the resolutions provided for
would not prove beneficial.
He was supported in his argument by
P. J. TomaJty of the Thirtieth district. Mr.
Tomalty said he knew every one in his
district, but that he did not know every
one's politics for the reason that they
changed the complexion, of their beliefs so
often.
J. H. Farrell, also of the Thirtieth . dis
trict, thought the delegates should be
elected by Assembly districts and brought
the argument to> a close by moving that
the resolutions be changed to that extent.
His motion, however, was defeated over
whelmingly.
The resolutions as adopted read as fal
lows:

There were few persons in the audience
of the Tivoli last night who could dis
tinguish in the acting of Annie Meyers,
who appeared as Sally in "The Babes in
the- Â¦Wood," traces of the keenest sorrow
that can embitter the life of a loving wife
and mother. While the audience laughed
at her merry antics and listened to her
tremorless voice raised in song, the spirit
that animated both was lacking because
of the deep grief that tugged remorseless
ly at her heartstrings. But the sobs that
welled up in her throat gave way to
laughter more or less forced, and few
there were who realized that her breast
was shaken by the most poignant anguish,
which, happily, found relief in bitter tears
every time she made her exit into the
wings. <r
A few minutes before leaving her home
on Post street to go to the theater, Mrs.
Meyers received a telegram -from her
brother, John Jarboe, announcing the
death of her husband, Harry Meyers,, at
Baltimore, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
The unhappy woman was nearly pros
trated at the unexpected intelligence, and.
it was with great difficulty that she could
muster up sufficient courage to appear at
the theater and enact her role. As she
had no understudy she determined not to
fail the management, and with tears
streaming down her face she entered the
theater and communicated, the sad intel
ligence to Manager Leahy. Mrs. Meyers
bravely undertook to play her part as
usual, but for her benefit much of her
business was cut. In the -second act her
feelings well nigh got the better of her,
but she rallied in time and was enabled '
to go through the part without any
marked betrayal of the deep emotion that
possessed- her soul.
Mr. and Â¦ Mrs. Meyers were married
nearly twenty years ago and were warmly
attached to each other. Deceased was a
good singer and for two years was a
member of the Tivoli, chorus. His health
gave way about two years ago 'and six
months since he went to" Baltimore in the
hope that he might find relief. He steadily
grew worse, however, but his death was
totally unexpected. The Interment will
take place in Baltimore. The deceased

Camp-Fire Scintillations.
of Putting Certain Questions
to the "Woman in the
' â¢; Case."
The investigation into the '! taking Â¦ of
$30,000 from the cashier's vault at the Mint
resulted yesterday in important discov
eries. . .-â¢
Director Roberts. Superintendent Leach
and Secret Service Agent Hazen were
closeted for many hours with Walter
Dimmick, the chief clerk of the Mint, who
la believed to know more about the disap
pearance of the sacks of gold than he is
willing to tell.
The investigation into the life led . by
Dimmick in the last year was resumed.
Information has been secured by Secret
Service Agent Hazen that Dimmick,
though a married man, has been most at
tentive to a charming widow and that
her tastes were most extravagant.
A significant happening in connection
with the robbery from the Mint is that
the "woman ir the case" suddenly left heÂ»
lodgings on Powell street on Tuesday,
July 3. and the next day Dimmick, it Is
claimed, went to a newspaper office and
gave out the story of the robbery...
The investigating "officers are of the
opinion that but for the publicity given
to the robbery the thief would have been
caught in a trap that was prepared for
him. '
Widow Has Disappeared.
The woman with whom Dimmick is sup
posed to have been most friendly is well
known in political circles in this city. In
vestigation shows that she has moved
from one address to another in the last
year and that she was always disinclined
to tell where she lived.
At the rooming house on Powell street,
where she has resided* for the last three
months, it was stated last evening that
she had not given up her rooms, though
she had not been seen there since Tuesday
of last week..
Dimmick refuse to give any information
as to his acquaintance with the widow
in question. He neither affirms nor denies
the allegations made that he lavished
costly presents upon her.
."People will talk,'.' he says, "and what
can I do to stop them?"
The. secret service officials are now try
ing to locate the widow and hope to se
cure from her some information that may
be of vital importance in the investiga
tion of the Mint robbery.
Expert Maguire has almost finished his
work on the books of the Mint and so far
has not discovered a single error. The
faint hope that an error might account for
the missing $30,000 has long been dispelled.
The money was deliberately stolen from
the cashier's vault and the thief held such
a position in the Mint that his presence
in the cashier's room would not attract
attention.
Dimmick Shows Mental Strain.
Dlmmlck's examination yesterday took
many hours and he showed the effects of
the mental strain he passed through.
There Is not 'an employe of the Mint who
has a kind word to say for Dimmick and
none defend him from the suspicion that
he was well acquainted with the combi
nation of Cashier Cole's gold vault.
The sum of $4,800,000 was inspected and
counted yesterday and the coin was re
sacked and sealed. So far no shortage
has been found Â¦ in any -of the sacks of
coin inspected by the officials.
One of the Investigating officers, in
speaking of the robbery, said:
"This is a difficult case as far as getting
evidence that would .warrant a conviction
is concerned. From the start we have
felt convinced of the guilt of a certain
employe, but the necessary legal proof is
lacking. No one saw. him open the vault'
or enter it; no one saw him take the
money away and no clew can be found to
the sacks or tags. Yet we are convinced
of his guilt. "We" hope, however, to dis
cover certain evidence that wfll place an
entirely different aspect on the case."
The count of the gold in the Mint will
not be finished for some days. "When it
is completed, Director Roberts will make
a full report to the Treasury Department
and it is then expected that there will be
many phanges made in the personnel of
the Mint staff. Â¦ . " .
