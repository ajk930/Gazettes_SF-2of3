no_textlage at what they considered a fair
amount. No money is asked for, but
each district must make and deliver so
many pounds of copra, the dried kernel of
the cocoanut, which Is the chief native
product. Formerly the natives could only
get a- cent a pound from the traders for
their copra, but I have sold it by tender
for nearly two cents, a considerable gain.
In this way we raise a revenue of about
$7500, which is sufficient to defray the
modest expenses of our administration.
One thing we have not got yet, and that
is a Government house. I am going to see
about it when I reach Washington, and
hope to get funds enough to build a neat
little bungalow somewhere on the shores
of Pago Pago, which will serve as head
quarters for the administration. Up to
the . present," as . commander of the Ab
arenda as well as Governor of the islands,
,1 havo lived on board ship. But when the
coaling, stationhs completed and the Ab
arenda-is .- a house will be
needed. I suppose the Navy Department
will always keep a vessel stationed there,
otherwise it will be necessary to have a
small permanent white garrison, say fif
teen marines. I have already formed a
miniature native army of fifty-â¬lght en
listed Samoans, who make excellent sol
diers. They pick up their drill with mar
velous rapidity, and their discipline Is
perfect, l could easily increase this force
if necessary, as there is no trouble about
obtaining recruits, but happily a larger
army Is . not needed.
Manua, the other principal island over
which I have charge, is some sixty miles
away, so that, it is more rarely visited.
I have pursued the "same policy there,
with slight modifications, to suit tho pe
culiar character of the people. The
Manuana,. being so Isolated, ' have some
strange oustoms, unknown to the rest of
Samoa. They used to have a Queen,
whom they regarded -with the greatest
awe and reverence. They, worshiped her
talnous for cultivation, and there ore na
large level areas suitable for plantations.
The only native industry is the produc
tion of copra, which is purchased by the
traders or exchanged for European goods.
Healy, Ttbblts & Co., the contractors for
the coaling station, have about thirty
white employes, hut I have only had trou
ble, with them on one occasion, when I
had to adopt tho extreme course of de
porting a man. He was an ugly-tempered
fellow, a deserter from the navy, and at
the Fourth of July celebration endeavored
to stir up a flsrht among tha natives. He
grossly insulted tho officer who stopped
him, and In consequence was arrested
and sentenced to several months' Impris
onment. I gave him the option of serv
ing out his sentence or going to Ban
Francisco, and he chose the latter course..
The lesson had a wholesome moral effect.

hi?h rank which he holds he has evi
dÂ«mtly never acquired the domineering
hi vbit. He is just the kind of a man
to vrln the affection and confidence of
n limple-minded, semi-savage, sus
picious race like the Samoans. And
this is what Tilley has done. He has
achieved a peaceful victory of infin
itely' more value to the world than
man; r a deed of war. He has made a
T^fir o, small though it be, happy an-1
prosperous. He has been the first to
show t]ie world that Uncle Sam can
govern. a colony wisely and well. For
the sprtoe of more than a year he has
been absolute ruler over the people
of Tutuila, subject only to the con
trol of tiie far-away administration
in -Washington. Wisely enough, the
Cabinet lias let Commander Tilley
have MÂ» own way entirely, and the
result has "been peace and prosperity
throughout the little group of isles.
There are 'five altogether under the
control of the "United States. Tutuila,
the largest, has a population of some
four thousand souls, and is of the
greatest Importance because it pos
sesses the magnificent harbor of
Pago Pago, the finest haven in the
South Seas. Here all the warships be
longing to TJncle Sam could ride in
safety without the slightest crowd
ing, and here we are constructing a
magnificent coaling: station and pier,
at a cost of over $300,000. Indeed,
It is safe to say that if it were not
for this harbor the TJnited StatÂ«3
would never have dreamed of acquir
ing an interest in the Samoan group.
"Ma-nun, with a population of 20O0,
'comes next, and then there are the
smaller islets of Tau, Olesanga and
Ofu. This is the little cluster of trop
ical reef and rock over which Com
mander Tilley. rules, and here is the
tale of his administration as he tells
it for The Sunday Call.
THE annexation of Tutulla actually
took place on the, 17th of February,
1900. but it was the 4th of April be
fore we received news of the event.
Amid general jubilation we hoisted
Old Glory on the hill above Swimming
Point, Just Inside the entrance to Pago
Pago. Here the coaling station, which is
to be finished . next October. Is being
erected, and here, for the present, is the
seat of government.
Though only Just appointed Governor. I
was not a stranger to the native ways
and customs. I had been in Samoa over
a year as commander of the Abarenda,
stationed at Pago Pago In order to super
vise the erection of the . coaling station.
Thus I had had ample time to study the
strange ways and customs of the Tutul
lans, and as soon as my commission came,
was all ready to go ahead. Moreover, I
was fortunte enough to secure an Invalu
able assistant, Mr. E. w. Gurr, a gentle
man who has spent many years In Sa
moa, and who Is thoroughly conversant
There were â¢ many Injurious customs,
which had. existed from time immemorial,
which could only be abolished by general
consent. Chief among- these was the prac
tice of going on malangas, or large picnic
parties. A whole village would suddenly
make up Its mind to take a wandering
holiday. All work would be dropped and
the merry party would start on its trav
els. With the Samoans the virtue of hos
pitality Is developed to an excessive de
gree, and it was the bounden duty of
each village to lavishly entertain the vl3-
I considered that the best way to gov
ern these people was to let them govern
themselves. The Samoans are still in tho
patriarchal state; the head of each house
hold Is supreme ruler of his own little
family and these chiefs. In turn, form a
council which governs each village. Each
town is practically Independent of the
other, though there is a parliament, or
fono, for every district, which, however,
used to do little more than talk. My aim
was to modify this system so as to adapt
it to the reauirements of civilized gov
ernment without at the same time inter
fering with the deeply rooted customs of
the people or wounding their susceptibili
ties in any way. To achieve this I fol
lowed the plan which haa proved so suc
cessful in Fiji, of appointing native chiefs
as local magistrates, or governors, In each
district
The great trouble was the superabund
ance of material available. Nearly every
other man 'was a chief and. naturally,
they all sought the coveted positions.
There was no question about the head
chief, Mauga. He was undoubtedly the
man of highest rank in Tutuila, but the
minor chiefs all seemed to have equal
claims to precedence. However, after an
exhaustive genealogical research we got
the right men selected, and the natives
themselves - elected them magistrates.
Then we held a general council, and very
sensibly the natives began to institute
their own reforms.
The natives of Tutulla are naturally a
kindly, gentle, simple-minded race, and It
was only due to the lack of good govern
ment that they developed warlike tenden
cies. Before the annexation there was
practically no central administration on
Tutuila, for the allegiance to the King of
Samoa was purely a nominal affair, to be
set aside whenever the natives chose. The
Inevitable result was a long series of petty
tribal wars, which, though they caused
little loss of life, kept the country in a
continual state of ferment. The men on
one side of the Island were always threat
ening war against those on the other; the
natives, ever apprehensive of conflict,
would not take the trouble to cultivate
their yam and taro plantations, and food
was very scarce. They argued., with some
show of reason, that it was no use plant
ing things when an enemy might come
along any day and destroy them. Leone,
the chief town, or village, was surrounded
by a high stone wan, the only place so
fortified in the islands, and was practical
ly always in a ptate of siege.
I put a ston, at once to this lamentable
condition of affairs. The first thing I did
Was to disarm, the natives. They gave
up their guns readily enough without
compensation, though I hope to induce tho
administration to pay for them. Mostly
they were very poor weaponsâ old . Snlders
and Remingtons, with the stocks badly
worm eaten, but then they were capable
of killing men and the people were bcJWer
without them.

My tnsk wÂ«h made nattier liecauso the Â»
annexation wna vary popular among. the'
native*. They greeted thÂ« Stars and
Stripes with tho utmost enthusiasm and
gladly swore alltglanco to tho United
States. This was in striking contrast to
the scene when the German flag was
hoisted on Upolu. Thero tho natives bit
terly resented foreign dominationâ they
wanted, only tho Sumoan flag. They got
out their war spears, blackened their
faces, and a fight seemed Imminent. How
ever, under the wIbo nnd kindly adminis
tration of Dr. Solf, the Governor of Ger
man Samoa, matters soon quieted down,
and affairs on this part of the group nre
now nearly as satisfactory as In my own
territory.

wont-where Hbo and ret. food. If, how
cvtr, provisions were plentiful othern
could romi! nnd cat with them. Thus no
one ever thought of laying up stores for
the morrow, and If there was a general
failure of the crops the natives often Buf
fered Bevorely from lack of food. The
llrst council decided unanimously to pro
hibit malnngas, and tho custom was drop
ped at once, for tho natives are wonder
fully law abiding and obedient.
Another curious custom which had to
be stopped was the presentation of fine
mats at weddings and other ceremonials.
These mats, from a Samoan point x ot view,
constitute the most valuable kind of prop
erty. They are woven with great care
from a species of pandanus fiber and tho
making of one of them will occupy a
skilled woman for a couple of yenrs.
Every householder possesses a number of
them. They are handed down from gen
eration to generation ns heirlooms. The
older and more ragged they are the more
precious they become. As they are never
sold for cash, their value can only be ap
proximately estimated in American
money.* but taking their equivalent
in native produce they are worth
all the way from $1 to $500. Now,
â¢whenever there was a , big wed
ding all the bride's relatives were com
pelled by custom to make presents of fine
mats, in return for which the bride
groom's people gave an equivalent
amount in food or in trader's goods, such
as cotton prints, biscuits, salt, beet, etc.
This practice led to an enormously waste
ful expenditure, so that a big wedding
often impoverished a whole village for
years. Also, whenever a chief of impor
tance died a large number of fine mats
M r ere burled with him and there was
much, accompanying feasting. All thes^
things now .belong to the past and the
people are correspondingly benefited.
As the Samoana are naturally a virtu
ous people, I have left their marital cus
toms undisturbed, except that It is now
necessary to get a certificate of permis
sion from the native Governor before the
ceremony. Then the couple are free either
to go to the missionary and have a relig
ious service or to get united In the old
fashioned native way, fa'a Samoa. Of
course, I have not interfered in any way
with the religious belief of the people,
The missonaries go on with their work
of evangelizing and educating just as fop
fore annexation. The lvsndon Missionary
Society, under the charge of Dr. Cooper,
has by far the largest number of con
verts; In fact, In a rellgloua sense, It dom
inates the group. The society, which
teaches an absolutely unsectarlan form of
Christian worship, has churches and
schools all over the islands and a new
high school for girls has Just been com
pleted at Leone at a cost of over $10,000,
I cannot speak too highly of the excellent
work dono by this missionary body and
am doing all in my power to assist it. :
On the other hand we have a number
of Mormon apostles whom I would be
heartily glad to get rid of. Not because of
their peculiar religious views, but because
of the Injurious effect they have on the
native mind. These so-called apoatles
come to the Islands without any money
and perforce must exist on native hospi
tality. They live In the same manner and
place themselves on the same level with
the Samoans. In consequence they, do far
more harm than good. Their action tenda

and to. make Increasingly difficult the

pendent upon the people he Is trying to
convert. He 6hould live. In good style. In
a good house, so ns to raise instead of
lower the native Ideas of comfort. The
London Society missionaries do this, and
so ought the Mormons.
The' taxation question was a serious
problem at first; for Samoans, like most
other people, naturally object to be taxed
by others. Here again I turned to Fiji
for example, and settled the matter by
allowing the natives to tax themselves for
their own benefit. Money was needed to
defray the expenses of administration,

to Royalty.
THE United Stetes contributes a vast
eum of money regularly to the sup
port of foreign sovereigns. The
money Is not paid as tribute, but in
the form of Interest upon many millions
cf dollars invested by these potentates.
It is generally supposed that several
royal personages own real estate in New
York. As a matter of fact their holdings
consist of railroad and industrial stocks
and United States bonds.
Queen Victoria is believed to have de
rived an income of $700,000 annually from
her American investments. She has been
generally credited with owning a large
interest In the Bowling Green building,
though as a matter of fact her money was
nearly all Invested in stocks. Her hold
ings Included American Sugar, American
Steel and Wire, Tennessee Coal and Iron
and one or two railroad stocks unknown.
King Edward, when Prince of Wales,
enjoyed a considerable Income from Am
erican railroad holdings. The property
has since been transferred to his son
George.
The Emperor of Germany has holdings
In the Union and Southern Pacific,, Il
linois Central and Atchison Railroad
bonds. His wife has, besides, about a
half-million In American railroad hold-
Ings, and it is believed that several other
members of the royal family are interest
ed to considerable amounts.
The Czar of all the Rueslas Is said to
be the best informed of all European sov
ereigns on American railroad interests.

years ago. one of Southern Cal-
ifornia s thrifty pioneers Intro-
duced. as a feature of his arbo-
etum. a strange species of < ma-
mental grass from the distant pampas of
South America, he little dreamed the fu-
ture that awaited his novel importation,
Wlthin a decade after the planting of that
alien grass root It had proved to be the
nucleus of an Industry without a parallel
in uniqueness, while its beautiful filmy
product was destined to become one of
the nation's most exalted emblems.
In its general aspect the plant was
wholly unlike any other botanical sped-
men indigenous to the continent. In
every sense favored by soil and climatic
conditions, its development seemed all
that cculd be desired# and at the ggj of
the first year It presented the appearance

proportions of a dozen feet in height :iy as

But the most remarkable feature of this
product of the Argentine wilds consisted
in its splendid snow-white plumes which
began appearing about the fourth year
and by the sixth literally enveloped the
Immense grass plant in a delicate, fleece-
like mantle. Though exquisitely beautiful
to look upon, these stately shaft- were
exceedingly fragile and when handled
their subtle floret* would dissolve almost
as readily as thistle down. However, from
the earliest appearance of the plumes the
cultivator determined, if possible, to de
vise some process whereby their preservat
ticn might be encompassed. After much
experimenting this was finally accum
plished, with the result that an immediate
demand for the perfected product was es
tublfehed. So universally was this interest
manifested that the owner of the plant

In addition to its popularity abroad,

its snowy appearance rendering it singu

At the floral carnivals annually observ

the part of visitors and residents, the
most marvelous creations in the way of
ornamental designs being effected
through its medium. .
But one of the most graceful tributes

it will be seen that unless some means is
devised whereby the wornout plantations
can be redeemed by reasonable methods
the damage to lands resulting from tha
â¢ industry will seriously conflict with tha
profits derived therefrom. That some
such remedy may speedily be discovered
will be devoutly hoped by all who have
ever beheld this beautiful California
product.
"While pampas grass is cultivated Wore
or less throughout the entire district of
Southern California by far the most at
tention is given to . the Industry in the
county of Santa Barbara, where the
plant was first introduced. Of recent
years a serious impediment to the in
dustry has developed, the circumvention
of which is yet to be accomplished. Thl3
difficulty lies in the fact that many of
the most extensive pampas plantation?
have exhausted their productiveness,
while so compactly have the roots of
the aged plants become imbedded in the
soil that their removal would mean the
wrecking, from surface to hardpan. . of
the entire area covered. In cases where
the moving of such specimens is impera
tive it Is frequently found necessary to
first undermine the plant and then de
molish it with a heavy blast of dynamite.
But even in such. instances there remains
a great, unsightly cavity which must be
filled in with soil secured elsewhere. Thus
what resemBle immature corn tassels,
their prevalent color being a dingy gray.
They are next carried to the drying
grounds near at hand, where they are laid
out in long symmetrical rows and allowed
to remain exposed to the sunshine until
thoroughly bleached and cured. The
. plumes are now of a beautiful fluffy
whiteness, and It only remains to gather
them up and pack them in cases for ship
ment.
The best market for pampas plumes is
in Germany, and accordingly a large per
centage of the annual yield is shipped to
that country. The prices realized from
the product vary somewhat with each
year, but the yield is invariably enor
mous, which usually Insures the grower
satisfactory returns. As with all other
producers the pampas planters can cite
some truly phenomenal profits enjoyed by
their Industry at various intervals in the
past.' As, for example, some years since
a certain small producer who had two
and a half acres set to pampas grass sold
his annual crop for $1750, making his land
yield him at the rate of 5700 the acre.
Thus the pampas industry came to be
established in Southern' California, and
so remunerative did it prove, that within
the space of a few years numerous plan
tations, representing vast areas of valu
able lands, became, devoted "to the new
commodity. In laying out a pampas
plantation the young grass roots are' set
out In regular parallel rows,' the same
order being observed as in the planting
of an ordinary orchard, excepting, that
much greater space Is allotted'to each
plant. Once thoroughly started, but lit

But all the time that our women havÂ«
been organizing other women have been
doing the same. In thirteen countries,
besides the United States there are Na.
tior.al councils, built up in ways similar
to our way, and all clamoring for union.
This is how it' came about that the big
gest thing of all was formed. Fourteen
national ccnndls are banded Into an In
ternational council, and they count their
numbers by the millions.
An American woman Is president of that
body.
More than that, she is a "Western tto
m?in as the Atlantic coast reckons it, for
she comes from Indiana. Eager, impetu
ous, ' self-confident,' clear-headed as the
West is, one of Its women Is this interna
tional president.
She is Mrs. May Wright Sewall. a typi
cal American woman in force, indepen
dence, broad-mindedness. She is principal
of a girls' school in Indianapolis; and is
active in no end of women's clubs.
She seems to have an- Infinite capacity
for work, for- organization, for responsi
bility; The International council sized her
up In this way when It elected her.
"I can't say that I have come to ' this
coast for anything but to enjoy ms'self,"
she says, "but In talking "to Pacific Coast
women I may plant a seed that will sprout
by and by. I wish I could see you have
local and State councils that would come
into the national council.
"That is what Is wantedâ union. The
West and East do not work together now
because they do not know each other. I
want to see them become, acquainted."
She looks like the one to<perform the In-
troduction.
She is a cental woman.
There Is a friendliness and an under
1 standing about her that make it quite
conceivable how she will say to the "West:
'Here is your older sister, the East, want
ing to be better friends"; and to the East:
"The West is in sympathy with your
ends." Ar_*l they must grow, nearer If she
intends that they shall.
She was found at Mrs." Swift's home on
Valencia street. Mrs. Swift is one of the
International patrons of the council, and
there is a royal lot for the two of them
to talk over.
The marked thing about Mrs. Bewail Is
what isn't marked. You will notice In
many woman's clubs, not of the first rank,
a tendency to choose for president that
woman who has the most of what is called
"presence." There Is a literary club in
one of the large towns of this State whose
president' Is the type that Gibson draws
for the ideal mother of his Ideal girl. Fine
*of feature, queenly of figure, you know;
and when she speaks In public on the
stage, you wish that she. had been willing
to remain a Gibson picture.
It Is Just this that Mrs. Sewall. presi
dent of the greatest of all woman's clubs,
is not.
She Is not tall and her manner and style
of dress would indicate that she does not
study to impress with her "presence." It
is the personality of the woman . that
counts, the woman behind the presence.
There Is a great motherliness about her;
a warm sort of outreaching to take In
every one that comes her way. Intellectu
al she must bÂ« to have accomplished what
she has: forceiul, too, and finely educated;
but above all stands out that warmth,
that cordiality that is much deeper than
manner. These people who talk a Ereat
deal' nowadays about the thought of us
would say that she "projects love."
Apropos of that, it looks as if her hobby
were International peace. She won't own
that she has a hobby. She couldn't very
Â¦ well, being officially in" charge of so many
hobbies. But she can't help reverting to
that very often in her talk of the work of
her council.
In appearance she is of medium height
â barely that â and agreeably "plump In a
matronly way. Her face has individual
ity; once seen, it must be remembered.
The mouth Is firm, tight; the eyes -are
* bluish-gray, earnest' for "the most part,
now and' then twinkling with the good
tempered humor that some bluish eyes
know. They natrow almost to disappear
ing when the smile is a particularly genial

She was dressed in a dainty Persian fig
ured foulard silk. Daintiness is the key
note of her personal appearance. She'is
entirely feminine in all except that splen
did executive brain, and she will not like
it that I have not called that feminine,
too.
"I shall be delighted to tell you about
the work of the International In Paris last
year," she said In her clean-cut, business-
like way. She has talked much for publi
cation and she drives directly to the point,
making every minute count.
"We held an executive session there in
the first place, and after that, on Tues
days, we field conferences." Men and wom
en of all nations attended and we had ad
dresses by the most able people who were
in Paris. The embassies were interested
in us and gave us their support In secur-
Ing the best.
"Always during those ten weeks our
watchword was Internationalism. That is
what we are striving forâ to bring to
gether the women of the world, through
them to Wing together the men, and In
time to bring all nations into that perfect
understanding which shall mean peace."-
What she has -to say on tills point Js
best summed up in the letter which she
wrote to "the Czar of Russia in 1S39. She
was then retiring president of the Na
tional Council. '^
"The members of the National Council
of Women\of the "United . States," she
wrote, ','beg his . Majesty to accept their

which he has been .moved 'Â¦, to .render hu

Some of the Biggest Things in the World.
THE biggest diamond in the world is
the great Goblnd gem,- which weighs
nearly 450 karats/ is as big as an
average inkstand, and worth about
$450,000. Three murders and countless In
trigues and robberies have had it for their
object. It now belongs to the Rajali i ; of
Futtehpore. The smallest- diamond on
earth, can Just be seen with trie' naked
eye. A microscope shows it to be of per
fect water and brilliancy, and its actual
market value Is 'about a cent : as'" a dia
mond. As a curiosity, however, it '"Is
worth $75.
The biggest man In the world is 'Brenni,
the Swiss giant. There are several Swiss
giants, but Brenni overtops them all with
his height of nine feet seven 'inches, anirl
he is a big man in proportion. HSs clothes
cost him $73 per suit, and he cannot j^et
Into an ordinary railway carriage. Ills
oppositeâ the smallest man aliveâis'Me
truEki, "the" little Hungarian, who. is just
under three feet high. He can get into
the clothes of an ordinary large doll,,an.'l
feel small in them. He makes more mom*y
than his big rival, making $10,000 a your
as a "freak," while the giant Brenni only
gets $6000. He Is accomplished, is much
stronger In proportion than the giant, and
will probably last longer.
' The hugest steamship afloat Just now Is

Among living things the most vast is a

that whatever is most, promotive of the

pretation. They unite in the hope that
his Majesty, in the execution of his be
nevolent designs, may enjoy the co-opera
tion of the governments of all civilized
countries throughout the world." * -i*'.~:.
And yet there are so many other objects
in view of the organization that she can
give only a small part of her time to the
"work of peace. The National Council de
fines Its objects thus: To .make better
known to the general public the razgni
tudp and. variety of women's work. To
avoid the multiplication of organizations
each with some special object, and thus
to secure results at less extravagant ex-
of time, money and force. To
bring together women In all lines of work,
to the end that they may be more intelli
gent respecting all others and consequent
ly more sympathetic with all others. To
give the united influence of these women
to all lines of work that all can heartily
agree upon.
And the lines of general work :of the
National Council are these: Peace and
arbitration; to work to secure the adop
tion of the international peace flag by
all organizations of women and to assist
by all means In Its power the causes of
social peace and International arbitration.
.Education' and citizenship; to introduce
into the schools of the land, public and
private, - sound and , honest Instruction In
general as well as In United States his
tory; in civil government and especially
in civic duty. Domestic science; to study
the sociological, questions affecting do
mestic life and. to diffuse the results of
such studies. Dress: To promote study
for the hygienic and esthetic Improve
ment of women's dress and to arouse pub
lic sentiment in favor of greater attention
to health, ease and beauty therein. The
admission of women to equality with men
m the work of the church of whatever
denomination. Other lines are: Equal
pay for equal work, divorce reform, so
cial purity.
You see, this Just covers the objects of
the' various organizations that make up
the' council. "Wlien the council meets rep
resentatives "from Its different organiza
tions present their own' work before the
general body. "When the International

' There are now fourteen nations repre
sented In the great council, and that,
means a total membership of 7,000,000. The"
figures tell their own story.
Seven more" countries are on the verge
of Joining, "and it is probable that at the
next quinquennial, which will be held in
Berlin in 1904, there will be twenty-one na
tions represented. y
Those at present belonging come from
the uttermost parts of the earth. Not only
do the greater nations, such as England,
the United States, Germany and France,
belong, but such as New South Wales,
New Zealand and Tasmania. All docu
ments are printed in English, French and
German: addresses are delivered In these
languages.
"The whole trouble between the "West
and East is that they have never been
brought together," Mrs. Sewall says.
"They are friendly as far as the wish
goes."" .

Shafter Howard, Mrs. Julia Sanborn and .
Mrs^ Mary "Wood Swift, who is also an In
ternational patron. These are the people
who will nourish the seed that Mrs.
Sewall has planted In California.
"What it means to be an International
patron is touched upon in a letter which
Mrs. Sewall wrote Mrs. Swift.
"I know you will be interested in. seeing '
what work you have been aiding," she
wrote, "and I* confess with gratitude that
the work which was done at Paris couid
not have been undertaken at all but for
our patrons. I think much good was ac
complished by this work. You have the
satisfaction of feeling thnt you were a di
rect and important contributor.
"My own view of the patrons Is that
they, occupy the position of a board of ad
;. visors â that they constitute a sort of privy
council, to any one of whom the president
may apply for -advice or help. I. am
helped every day as I go feebly forward
in my efforts by the .reflection that you a?

ance." â¢ â¢
And this woman, this enterprising
American woman, elected to preside over
7,000,000 other women, closes with: ' ;

SECOND FOURTH
1899
on sea Is something to remember to the
grave.
Scarcely had the first ship cleared the
harbor entrance before a Bhot from one
of the Oregon's sfr-pounders, manned by
marines, sounded sharp and clear, and
the battle of the century w'as on. The
American ships closed in, and the Spanish
or-eced with a volley, which was Imme
diately â¢ returned. this Juncture the
tcrpedo boats had .cleared the entrance
and were headinff for our ships at full
speed with a view j of torpedoing them.
Â¦\Vcrd was passed to man the starboard
guns. The secondary batteries of all the
ships within gun range were immediately
tralred upon the torpedo boats, but it was
a well-directed shot from the after six
inch starboard gun of the Oregon that
struck one of the torpedo boats amid
ships and seemed to part her in two, after
which she' headed for the shore, barely
able to reach it. The other 'torpedo boat
was sunk by the secondary batteries of all
the ships. /
Great shells . from the Spanish ships
were passing over us, and their madrush
through thÂ© air. told their destructive
powers. The Oregon was a sheet of
flame from the firing of other. guns and
dense columns of smoke partially ob
scured our view of the enemy. The men
below deck were heaving coal Into the
Colon, far ahead. X n Â« Oregon and the
Brooklyn steam within â¢ close ; proximity
of the Colon with guns trained on her..
A boat from the Brooklyn is sent to.re-.
ceive the surrender. Our. men cheer Cap
tain Clark again and again. In a broken .
voice he begs them to cheer themselves.
"It was you who did it, not I, men," he
says.
That night "we remained in the vicinity
of the sunken Colon. â¢When the morning
of the Fourth broke we steamed back
over, the scenes* of our triumph and
viewed ' with deepest curiosity the deeds'
of cruel war. i
We arrived among the fleet and took '
our usual station. At noon we fired a
national salute in honor of the Fourth.
"We had three wounded prisoners from
. the Colon on board, and when" the salute
was fired they became frightened and "
feared another battle was on. ....Â¦Â¦
After resuming our station Commodore
â¢ Watson transferred his broad pennant to Â¦
the Oregon and said he would have given
his right leg to have been aboard the'
Oregon during . fight. ! We pray God
that the Oregon may know many, other
happy Fourthsâ but we who lived through
it feel that she can never know, a more
glorious, memorable Fourth of July, than
that of '98 with Santiago and the Spanish'

of the -big guns was deafening and the
saltpeter from the powder smarted our
eyes. . â¢ . .
Suddenly some one shouted "She's on
fire," and the cheers rang loud. Present
ly another vessel is oA fire and the sweat
ing, battle-frenzied men again cheer mad
ly. The Maria Teresa is on the beach a
mass bf flames, her crew in distress, her
flag lowered and the Oquendo is likewise
heading shoreward meeting- a similar fate,
but fighting and doing the best she can:
By this time the Colon and Viscaya ~
have steamed well ahead and are nearly
out of range. The Oregon is rushing,mad
ly on, shelling the Oquendo as â¢ she
passes. The s Oregon continues to gain,
firing upon the Viscaya. The other Ameri
ican ships are ' far behind, save the
Brooklyn, which is on our. N port bow and
well out. The Viscaya, too, N ls on fire and
we are rapidly gaining and continuing a
fierce fire with all the guns that can be
brought to bear upon her. Soon she Is
hit in the quarter by. a big shell- which
seems to raise her stern out [ot the water
and she Is headed full speed for the
shore. She lowers her flag and â¢ the
Oregon steams on, leaving the Viscaya
to the American ships coming rapidly
astern.
Now there Is but one left, the fleeing
f - M
Who would ever have predicted that the
stanch Oregon would spend her third
'Fourth of July listed on the rocks at
Howky Light Straits, In the Gulf of
Pechlll? No one knew at- what moment â¢â¢â¢
our beloved Oregon wouU be swallowed
by lashing waters.' For days" and days
she had been on the rocks there, with but
a dim hope of ultimate, safety. "We on
board were prepared to jump for the al
ready lowered lifeboats at the first sJgn
that the ship could no longer hold Its
own. But the fact that our lives ' were
comparatively safe did little to lessen our
sorrowful fears lest the Oregon should
come to harm. "The Fourth will be the
fatal day," we said all along, as the tug
ging and straining to get her off proved
unsuccessful. We made up our minds that
she would slide off or sink on the Fourth
of July.
We had left Hongkong on June 23,' and .
on the 28th a heavy fog and strong cur
rents carried us out" of our course, and
we struck the rocks. Collision quarters
sounded and the men-' went to their sta
tions to close the water tank doors. Then
we stood by to abandon ship. We loved
the Oregon, every one of us, and the
thought of her going down, unnen-ed U3
.more than the danger to our lives. When
she gave evidence of holding her own for
a while at Iea3t Captain Wilde gave or- '
ders for the men to go to work.
Night and j day those men worKea as
Â¦men only work when their hearts are In
accord with their hands. If they could
Â¦ save the Oregon they didn't care whether
they ate or slept. The diver reported that
the hole was eighteen feet wide and
twenty-four feet long and she was listed
to the starboard within two de
grees of keeling over. The Eng
-IJsh wrecking company from the
other side of the island sent, a
large crew and a steam launch and 'two
ten-inch pumps. Through the heroic as
sistance of the men of life Oregon they
managed to cork up the hole with can
vas, sacks or any available stuff. The
Russian, English. Japanese and Chinese
cruisers did everything In their power to
help us. But she broke nine-inch hatisera
and could not move off the rocks. AH
around us lay the hulls of vessels that
had gone to their doom In that treacher
ous strait. So far the weather had been
perfect, but we knew a storm meant sure
disasterâ a heavy swell would have
dashed her to pieces.
Ori the afternoon of the 3d of July we
commenced to dress the ship for the mor
row. If she went down, we meant that
she should meet old Neptune in Fourth
of July attire. All day long on the Fourth
they tried to tow her off, but they couldn't
budge her. We had pinned our faith *to
that day of days, and when night fell like
a pall over her, still fast to the rocks, we
almost lost hope.
But on the'mornlne or tne oth, or her
own free will, at high tide, the majestic
Oregon floated off the rocks. She struck
a second reef, but again floated off that,
and on July 17 wÂ© were safely at Kure.
the Japanese naval station;' where sha
â¢was repaired".
"We had dressed the Oregon In flags, not
knowing whether they would be her
shrcud or the symbols of new life. It was
tLS though the doughty ship herself,
stirred by. those emblems of the country
she had served so well, made one last
mighty effort to escape the rocks that
gored her. Still flaunting her Fourth of
July attire, the Oregon floated off to the
sea and safety.

*^yy FTER the famous run of the Ore
f \ gon along the South Americar
J I coast ive ccaled at Key West, and
Â» I on May 29, I C 23. joined the Havana
blockade. The assembled ships
cheered the Oregon, and the band on the
Indiana played the "New Bully." Tha
next morning, in company with the flas
ship New Yerk. we steamed away far
Santiago de Cuba, and then came the
weary days and nights of watchfulness
on the Santiago blockade. On the M of
July we were detailed as guard ship.
About noon that Â£ay smoke was sighted
in the distance and, by order from the
Brooklyn, the Oregon immediately gave
chase under forced draft until she over
hauled what we ail felt sure was a prize,
but proved to be only a newspaper boat
making for Mole St. Nicholas with all
possible speed to transmit news to the
United States. - ~,
Often afterward the merry laugh of
Captain Clark rang out on the still Santi
ago air as he told how some officers of
the fleet had comicall*- sung out when the
Oregon started on her chase after thÂ»
tug. "There goes Clark: he's off fcr ths
Pacific again. Things are too . slow f sr
him here. Gocd-by." j
The sinking of the Merrimac was the
frfst exciting event until the 6th of Juno,
when after breakfast the buglers sounded
"Clear ship for action," the men went
quickly to their stations and soon every
thing was in readiness for firing. Slowly
the American ships steamed within range
of the forts and opened a fierce cannon
ade, which was returned with almost
equal fury by the shore batteries. Now
for the first time we were in the midst
of flying shells. Our big guns belched
forth their ponderous projectiles and the
forts returned the fire, but with poor
marksmanship. Battery after battery on
shore was silenced by the American gun
ners. The Americans finally withdrew
without the least damage from the en
emy's fire, but with a positive assurance
that the enemy had been greatly dam
aged, though they were at a loss to find
out the exact results.
On June 10 we were at Guantanamo fop
coal, and on that day forty marines from
the Oregon, in company with twenty ma-*
rines from the cruiser Marblehead. were
sent ashore under arms, thus forming th<Â»
first successful landing of armed troopi
on Cuban soil. "When we had finishe.l
coaling the big guns were turned upsi\
the town cf Caimanera. a distance of 75^
yards, and several shells were thrown,
into the town, doing great damage, many
of the inhabitants deserting the city in
haste.
From this on until the first of July we
continued the Mine routine before San
tiago. It was yetting monotonous and we
longed for decisive action. ' â¢ .
On the morning cf + he 1st of July we
had an early call to general quarters.
With guns manned we steamed under
the very guns of the shore batteries, but
for some reason no firing was done and
the American fleet withdrew after invit
ing the fire of the Spanish. They would
not open fire on us though we were with
in easy range of their guns. On the aft
ernoon of that same day the flagship New
York and the Oregon threw shells over
the hills into ihe city of Santiago. The
firing lasted for about two hours, after
which they returned to their respective
positions on the blockade.
Early on the morning cf the 2d we were
again called to general quarters and bom
barded the fortifications for over two
hours. Old Morro, which thus far had
been spared, was fired on and pierced bjr
numerous shells, which exploded with ter
rific force and rent asunder her mortared
sides. Great clouds of flirt and rubbish
were thrown up, which at times partially
obscured the ancient, picturesque build
ing, which, like a lonely sentinel, seemed
to have watched the movements of the
American fleet since the first day of its
arrival there. The ensign of Spain, which
for centuries had waved over Morro. was
shot down at 6:51 a. m. by a projectile
from cne cf the Oregon's big guns. When
the clouds of dust cleared away and It
was seen that the flag of Spain was down
cheers echoed from* every ship of the
blockade.
The Oregon then steamed to within 700
yards of Jlorro and to the very entrance
of the harbor and fired upon and silenced
. the Punts. Gorda batteryâ a battery
which until this time had remained in
tact.
Sunday morning. July 3, dawned
beautiful and bright. The waters before
Santiago harbor were as calm and beau

short rations, and when the order came
to go to Manila everybody was happy,
for square meals were in sight. We ar- l
rived at Manila on the Fourth, but too
late to take on supplies.
The other ships in Manila Bay were
dressed In gala attire, bands playing-; flags
waving and happy voices calling: across
_- the water. Hunger was gnawing too hard "
for our hearts to beat very high. But It
was the dear old Fourth, and with thft
comforting thought that on the morrow
our larder would be replenished, we man
aged to be cheerful and even join In the
national songs as the music of the bands
was wafted our way.
So, cheered by the promise of the" fat
days to follow the lean ones, we watched
' the Fourth go out on Manila Bay to the
boom of salutes* and the blare of the '
bands.

of tho proper conception of the advan

unexcelled throughout the world. Appre

Can Francisco and the State of Califor
nia have. then, come Into the region of
large opportunity.
The United States is one of the very
greatest surplus producing nations In tho
world. Our care should be to find a mar
ket for thesa nurplua products. California
is onÂ« of the very greatest surplus pro
ducing Rtnten In tho Union, and It Is
through the hartiqr of Snn Francisco that
this surplus must pass as i\ gateway. San

After all. the building up of a great port
ia a slow process; it la not done by legis
lation bo much as it Is done by the indus
ery and activity of the commercial ele
ments within the State. Trade represents
conditions, A fine free harbor does not In
and of Itself provide great results, but
it presents opportunities for the develop
ment of trade which ought to be grasped
to tho fullest extent.
When I spoke a moment ago of San
Francisco developing Us export resources,
I ennnot recur too strongly to the bene
fits to be derived from the continued pro
duction of the oil and petroleum resources
of this State. This will furnish the solu
tion of tho difficulty of cheap fuel: cheap
fuel means new manufactures, and new
manufactures mean a Held not only for
the labor of the State, but for the
export of the products of American labor.
The cheapness of oil as a fuel, at the
present time far less than that of coal,
will be of the largest advantage to the
greatness of San Francisco. Already un
dertakings are at hand Involving the ex
penditure in plants and Improvements of
peveral millions of dollars, which have
been attracted to tidewater by the great
production of oil In this State. I look to
thin Influence as one of the best for tho
commercial greatness of this harbor.
The Nicaragua canal is of so much more
Importance to the rest of the State that It
would outweigh the small incidental loss
which San Francisco might sustain by be
ing passed by certain of the vessels which
would use the new waterway. San Fran
cisco, however, would Immeasurably gain
from the increased greatness of the State,
and in this way the Nicaragua canal be
comes of first importances to 'San Fran
cisco, both commercially and as a port of
entry and export.
The Importance of the Nicaragua canal
to San Francisco, in so far as the require
ments of this port 'are concerned, cannot
be overestimated. It is true that this city
would lpse some of the commerce which
comes to It now by reason of its propin
quity to Asiatic countries. What it would
lose in this regard, however, would be
made up*at least tenfold by the develop
ment of tho industries and agricultural re
sources of this State by bringing the mar
kets of the world the nearer. California's
greatness will rest in the future on Its In
ternal resources and on the development
of its great Interior.
The policy of reciprocity advocated by
Mr. Blalne and carried out successively by
different administrations has been In a
different form the building up of the same
system. This furnishes an easier solution

been available by bringing cargoes of
coal rather than merely coming In bal
last. Theref orer what is true here is true
in many other directions. Vessels must
not be expected to either bring or take
merchandise unless they can do both.
This shows, therefore, the importance to
San Francisco of increasing our import
trade as well as our exports. The devel
opment of this theory has resulted in the
commercial greatness of England. The
establishment of Its colonies and the ac
quisition of provinces in distant lands
have not been made or brought about
merely for the desire of territorial expan
sion or political or governmental power.
He Indeed would be a superficial reader
of history who Interpreted the acts of
England's statesmen by any such rule.
The building up, however, of England's
trade and commerce have been the con
trolling incentive for this policy of expan
sion. The acquisition of the Philippines
ha3 brought this entire matter with force
home to us. Within less than two years
the exports from San' Francisco to Asiatic
ports have increased more than 200 per
cent. This shows the importance, com
mercially speaking, of the annexation of
distant lands.
â¢It ought further to be understood that
the requirements of this harbor do not
merely demand that goods be brought
here but It Is further essential that goods
be shipped from this port. As an example
of this, the price of coal has to some
extent heretofore been regulated by the
tonnage of wheat to be exported from
thiS State.- The charters required for the
carrying trade of our wheat supply have

It Is true that If all of these thlnrs de
flected commerce to other ports, their re
moval would Increase the shipping In the
harbor of. San Francisco. There must.
however, as a primary essential, be faund
practical reasons why merchandise should
be brought to thl* port, or exported from
It. before any artificial regulation can be
of substantial Importance.
Even New Tork, New Orleans and Bos
ton of our own country furnish Illustra
tions of this condition of affairs. San
Francisco, however, possesses one of tho
very few natural ports, if not the very
greatest pert, on the globe. The question
presents ksrlf as to how can It be bes 1 :
brought to Its best use. It ought to bo
thoroughly understood that a. great har
bor cannot be made such by legislative
enactment, or by the mere passage of
maritime regulations, or by the removal of
commercial restrictions.
This Is especially true of every one of
the well-known ports of those islands.
The same might be said of all the Euro
pean countries, with but few exceptions.
Enormous breakwaters and walls of con
crete and etone. together with jetties and
solid embankments, have been everywhere
constructed 50 as to render available tho
harbors of the Old World.
Any visitor to the Old World view'ng
any of the ports of Europe or of the Brit
ish Kingdom cannot but fail to bÂ«Â» con
vinced of the importance which a good
natural harbor possesses. In the entire
seacoast line of England. Ireland. Scot
land and Wales, as far as I have person
ally observed them, there Is not a single
* harbor but which has required the most
elaborate and expensive Improvements In
order to render it available for ocean com
merce.
The Interests of the two are commingled
and blended to the fullest possible extent.
The visit .of the Congressional Committee
on Rivers and Harbors has been a timely
one In attracting the attention of our
own people to the requirements of this
port. Few of our citizens sufficiently com
prehend the physical advantages which
nature has given us. Very little is needed
to supplement what has already been
found here free at hand.
This port will never assume Its true po
sition until California has reached its
proper development. "While, however, it
Is important to Â£an Francisco that the
Interests of the State should be developed,
it is also most essential to the State that
the harbor" of San Francisco should have
all needed retirements.

C"T\ T*E requirements of the harbor of
I San Francisco are matters which
I should attract the attention of the
! entire State. The greatness of San
Francisco must inevitably reflect
the greatness of California. The two will
always bo together.
F. S. Stratton, in his position of
Collector of the Port of San Francisco.

course upon this subject. He has
written at length upon this matter
exclusively and especially for the

that the stnrs and stripes has gone

tions in the world as California is
one of the very greatest surplus pro

The countries of the Pacific need
this surplus and San Francisco is the
one harbor of America through which
this supply for a great demand

of San Francisco"Go, fast," "ordered the engineer in a
smooth stretch of road, and she turned
on tho steam and z-z-a, they were off, her

"Stop quick, now," and the well-trained

"Here we are at a hill, and a pretty

chine came to a dead halt. ,
"I did know, after all," she said, "of
course I knew all the time."
She laughed then and her nervousness
was over. The examination went on with
the smoothness of a well-rehearsed play*
and the word was passed from one way
farer to another to come and admire.
As she drove smoothly over the rolled,
surface of the South Drive her examiner
asked questions and proposed problems

"What are you going to do about It?"

drive she lighted the, mimic engine and
thoy were off again.

"Twenty miles," she replied, sinfully,
for she knew the truth. â¢ "
and the injured child were the fictitious
emergencies that It is Mr. Saville'a busi
ness to invent. She entered into the spirit
of the thing with gusto.
"I'll get back up that hill." she an
nounced firmly, and she proceeded.
You have got to know your machine
pretty .well If you are going to make It
run backward up hill by reversing the
steam arrangement. When Mrs. Moore
did this she had scored a point that

It Is all in the same spirit
Fan Fraritisco is in line with the rest
of the world now. We have our own
char.fTeuses, and they are growing in
numbers. Time was when enc woman
held the honors all to herself: now we
have Mrs. Moore. Mrs. Miles Baird, Mrs.'
Talbot, and they are not half the list.
Two of them. Mrs. Mocre and Mrs.
F?a!rd. have been through the park exam
ination. Moreover, they have passed It.
Walt till you have seen a park examlna â¢
ticn and you will be more respectful.
There Is no city law corepellirg an ex-'
amiratlcn to be passed by the runners of
automobiles, so the park has to look out
for itself. It is first and last a pleasure
ground, and nothing that interferes With
nr.ybt dy's safe pleasure '.8 to be allowed
therein. And inasmuch as babies and
nurs-o ma'.ds have not got over
shying; at the machines the sensitive feel
ing of the babies and the nurse maids
l.ave to be considered.
Sj It i'ame about that a park ordinance
was created, ruling that no automobile
was to be driven within park limits un
less the driver thereof had obtained a
permit by means of various red-tape-tied
devices. The amount of the thing is that
vi-u have to puss an examination in the
us*, of the machine, and If .this test
jiruvÂ«s successful you are* given the per
mii after due ceremony. The number of
the permit is fastened in showy white let
ter* to the back of your machine, and
any officious officer about the park who
shall at any time challenge ycur right to
be motoring therein may be shown the
mystic sign which refers him to your
honorable permit.
Mrs. Charles C. Moore acquitted herself
with glory, so they say. when she was
put through her paces on her locomobile.
This machine Is a natty little runabout
that she handles no more dextrously
than she does the heavlersurrey and dos
a dos. But the runabout is her pet. In
lact, you can't have an auto of any kind
without reminding your friends of a fond
parent with the first-born. An 'auto has
great Individuality, and if you don't th'.nk
It Is alive, that just shows how much you
linow i\boui it.
â¢I was a little bit nervous about the
examination when I started in." says
Mrs. Moore, "because I had heard that
Mr. Saville was a very strict examiner."
H. D. Saville. park engineer, certainly
does mean business when he goes about
nis test. It Is all up to him, you see. and
if any of the autos that he has passel
should "get fresh" afterward within park
domain, he fceys be would hear of It. So
he provides for emergencies in his ques
tior.s.
It was en a Tuesday that the test came^
off. Tuesday is the day set aside for"
the** examinations, and Mr. Saville' a
business, from 3 to 5 on that day, is to
probe the would-be chauffeur.
When Mrs. Moore started out she
thought she knew all about her little ma
chine. She was certain of the reason for.
every lever and gauge and she was cer
tain of her steady hand. But when the
engineer looked at her and through her,
she wondered if her hand was going to
keep steady.
He looked over the locomobile and he
looked over her. Then he leaned an elbow
on the dashboard and glanced casually at
the brake.
"What's that for?" he asked suddenly.
"That? That's the brake," she answer
ed, puzzled.
"Yes. What's It for?"
It.had always seemed plain enough what
it was for. It was plainly meant to keep
your right foot busy. It occurred to her
that this was a very simple examination
ifter all and that she needn't be excited
over it.
"It's to stop the mnehine," she said glib
ly.
"All right. Now suppose tho brake
breaks and you want to stop In a hurry,
what are you going to do?" ?
"Why, It never does break," she stam
mered, and with the thought of her per
mit ahead she couldn't for the life of her
think of a better answer. Â»
The examiner saw that this sort of a
test was hopeless. "Let me get In there,"
he said, and took his place on the seat.
'He started the machine whirring along
the South Drive, where all automobiles
are confined. He covered the brake with
his foot.
"You can't touch the brake," he said.
Then, on the Instant. "That team Is
frightened. Stop." he cried.
And automatically she closed the throt
tle, turning "ft the Â«team. and the ma-
that wore to test her quickness and'un
dc'rstahdlnf!
The preliminaries are quickly sailed
over. . v
"What do you know about the throt
tle?"
"It is used to shut off the steam or let
it on." â¢; f . â¢
"And how do you open ltwhen starting
up the power?" ...: Â¦'.Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦,
"Very slowly." She Illustrated, bracing
her hand by hooking the third finger into
the iron ao that the hand found it easy to
move slowly instead of In Jerks. This, is
better for the machinery.
It is this throttle that keeps your right
hand busy In running the locomobile,
which Is a steam-propelled machine with
a gasoline engine to do the heating. Mrs.
Moore then showed, the deftness of her
left hand with the steering bar which'-is
to be held lightly, not gripped. â¢ If you ride
a wheel you know iO about that. The auto
counted.
Before they started off again the en
glncer mado an excuse to Jump out and
apeak to a park policeman on business.
Looking over the machine before ha
climbed back he contrived to put out the
fire.
As Mrs. Moore opened the throttle slow
ly there was no sign of renewed 'life In
the vehicle.
"Hello! What's the matter?"
"I'll find 3 out what's the matter," she
said, and descended. "The fire's out," she
exrJ.8.'Tnpft. "I never knew the wind to
tie, giving tho uteam full Bway to do the
hard task nhend, while the machine short
ed and puffed v.p the slope like a pudgy,
apoplectic old man. : . ,
"Down we go now. What about it?"
The slope was sharp, and she turned off
the steam altogether, leaving the brake
off, and- coasted. "No use of wasting
x Bteam when gravity will do the work,"'the
said.
"Didn't you, know that you threw a
child off a wheel as you passedâ at the
top of the hill? Go back, quick." .
Mrs. Moore paled like a Laura Jean
Libbey lady, for she did not yet know the
extent of Mr. Savllle's imagination.
"Quick," he. urged.
Then her color came back, and shÂ«
grasped the idea, that the narrow road
She drew the steering bar Inward In or
der to turn. "No, no; this road is toÂ«
narrow. You can't turn around here," hÂ«
exclaimed.
When Mr. Savllle had impressed upon
her the obligation of a maximum ten-mile
rate he tried her Judgment of the rate.
This is a test where the average appli
cant fall/i. It is a hard thing to gauge
your own speed, and It is guesswork at
best. However, Mrs. Moore's guess ap
peared to be a good one.
Going up the iiext slope
"That horse ahead of you is frightened."
he cried.
Mrs. Moore saw nary a horse In any di
rection, but she showed presence of mind.
A quick turn to the side of the road. Off
with the^ steam. On with the reverse
brake, and there they halted, stock still,
In the midst of ascending a hill.
For the rule of the park is that if any
thing, be It man, -woman, baby or horse,
shows fright at the new-century steed
that steed shall be halted until the -rlctlm
be calmed. Just how long this halt shall
last, supposing the baby continues to
weep. Mr. Saville says, becomes a matter
of sentiment. : Â¦
â¢ As they started" the engineer was seized
with a desire to go back. "This road la
wide enough to turn in," he said. "Turn
short."
There on the hillside sha'dld It. by a
delicate handling of the steering bar. a
keen hand on the throttle, a foot quick
at the brake and two eyes everywhere.
Both feet and both hands are always oc
ct'pled In the- driving, to say nothlnsr of
both earn and both eyes; and It Is only tha
expert who dares to talk. The locomobile
wfcfch Mrs. Moore handles gives ocupatlon
to the eyes, part of the time tn calling
upon them to keep track of thÂ© water
gauge. It is reflected In a tiny mirror at
the rijrhtâ it looks like a thermometer fill
ed with pink mercury. If the water rises
above half or sinks below It, then some
thing is to be attended to.
A* they rode alon*. fictitious carriages
and pedestrians and frightened horses
sprang up In every direction at one wave
of Savllle's wand, m every cafe the
chauffeuse turned to right or left, siowed
or stopped" as the case might be. Near
the end of the Journey:
"1 hear a runaway coming around 'that
curve," he shouted.
She laughed with the fun of the game
Â«nd on the Instant glanced up. There,
from the tree-hidden curve, dashed a
maddened little sorrel with a powerless
driver clinging foolishly to the lap robe
while the reins trailed the ground.
Mrs. Moore's face tightened. It was all
in an instant. A. sharp Jerk on the steer
ing bar that twisted the loco to the side
of the road, a closing of the throttle, and
there the machine stood against the grass
and out of the way of danger, while the
horse flung itself Into the trap of a mount
ed policeman's bridle.
"You're all right for your permit." said
Savllle.
But there can't be a real runaway made
to order for every Tuesday's test, and un
fortunately there isn't one. So Savllle says
that he hopes In time to have matters ar

THE nightmare, has nothing to do
with horses, althc ugh they occasion
ally have it; the word mare really
nr.earis Ir. this connection a specter.
According to the Bavarian popular
belief the nightmare is a woman who ap
pears in the morning asking to borrow
something. To keep her away at night
they promise her the three white gifts if
she tv 111 ceme for them the next mcrning,
and 'when she does conie, as she furely
will, she is given a htfrsdful of flour, a
handful of salt and an egg. In Morocco
It Is customary to place a dagger under
the pillow at night to ward off the night
mare, and in Greece a black-handled knife
Is supposed to have- the same effect. The
ancient Germans* believed that nightmare
was due to a demon who. during sleep,
seated himself upon the chest of* the
sleeper and oppressed his breathing.
The symptoms of nightmare are varia
ble, though they may be always extreme
ly disagreeable. It may be a realistic
sensation of falling from a high place.,
such. as the summit of a steep precipice;
or one may suffer all the horrors of a
flood or flre or a struggle with enemies
superior in force and number. Frantic ani
mals may attack or spring upon the
Fleeper, and with all these visions there Is
an inexpressible anguish end, pain, with
a sense of Imminent danger, escape or
defence Eeemlng Impossible, while the vic
tim 1r unable to cry out for assistance, or
in the always present struggle at last ut
ters a groan or two which may awake
him.
Nightmare Is especially distinguishable
from dreams by the sensation of depres
sion and suffocation. It is, in fact, a true
What Nightmare Really Is and Its Prevention.
temporary, miniature delirium. Sometimes
long after awakening it. leaves the subject
a prey to nervous anxiety, violent palpita
tion and unusual debility. In fact, it has
a. marked ana'osy with insanity, and If it
Is constantly rexutrinsr It may be of stfi
ous portent, pointing to some affection of
the brain or mind. Not that nightmare
causes nervous disease or insanity, but
that nervous disease pre-existing causes,
on the contrary, this special disposition of
the brain to temporary delirium.
From this !t can be -understood v/hy
nightmare is often hereditary, just as ab
normal m-rvous Impressionability' may be
inherited. The child, too. sensitive to the
slightest impression, a living bundle of
nerves. Is more especlal'v subject to night
terrois, even while awake, owing to the
power of the mind to project ideas Into
rpp.ee and with the eye to see them as
ectualities imbued with life. Next In sus
ceptibility are women and some men
whose brains hove remained in the Infan
tile state properly called simple-minded.
Anaemia, fever, disturbance of the circu
lation, cnused by diseases of the heart of
the large blood vessels: disturbed respira
tion, due -to nrthma or a full stomach,
are the most frequent predisposing causes
and are as powerful as nervous disturb
ance^, such as hysteria and hypochondria.
In causing nightmare. #
Sometimes nightmare Is due to pro
longed wakefulness, a radical change In
diet, or faulty position of the body, ' such
as lying upon the back or face. Some
times It Js due to some mechanical inter
ference, such as an aneurism or even swol
len tonsils. West has reported a cttse In
which, In spite of all hygienic treatment,
nightmare continued every njgfft for a
long period, due. as was Uncovered after
careCul consideration, to a prolonged
.uvula, which, during sleep, in the prone
position hindered free ' respiration. Cut
ting off the point of this mischievous
uvula caused the permanent, discontinu
ance of the visits of the nightmare. . .
In nervous persons emotional in charac
ter nightmare may be caused by gruesome
tales or wo.ful spectacles,, grief, discour
agement, hatred, anger, etc. In fact, the
most Intense nightmare is due to exhala
tions of passion, due to the loss of clearly
loved relatives or friends, sudden and ex
treme revKi: of fortune. " disappointed
ambition, the fear of disease, or even a
shock to one's self love and esteem, which,
as has been aptly said, slays more vic
tims than love.
The treatment of nightmare consists In
awakening the subject, and. If there is
perturbation of mind, giving some mildly
sedative potion, such "as .warm water
sweetened with syrup of lettuce. Follow
ing this, cafe should be taken to remove
the supposed cause, to prevent recurrence
of the nightmare. In the case of children
Wond erful Instinct o f the Wasp
ONE- of our commonest and moat in
teresting Insects is the threml
walsted wasp, which' builds iho
mud nests which are so numerous
in old outbuildings. The children usually
call these Insects "mud daubers." It Is
intensely interesting to watch these light,
rlende.r-ho.dled wasps busy with their ma
sonry. The mud of which their nests is
composed Is often carried for some ins
tance, as It is essential for them to ufea
cood. stiff clay. At the edge of. some
pond or 'stream you may see these Insects
running about! continually twitching their
glossy wings, their black .bscks showing
a fine stsel blue in the strong summer
sunlight. Some of them are nearly stand
ing on their heads as they roll sticky lit
tle balls out of the stiff mud with their
heavy Jaws. With this heavy load of mini
they rise slowly, and having gained some
height they get their hearings and fly in
a straight line to their nests. In this they
resemble the bees; indeed, all the wasps
and bees seem to have a wonderful fhc-
ulty for flying directly home from any
point. The expression, "making a' bÂ£e
line." is derived from this habit. of the
bees and their close kindred. . .
When the wasp has gained the place
It has selected for a bulldtng v site she puts
the tiny ball of mud against the wall uf
the building and rubs it tight by moving
her head from side to side very rapidly.
When doing this the Insect makes a low,
rap|d huzzlng sound. This, operation is
probably performed to insure the proper
texture for the mud, just as we work the
clay with a big wheel when making br'ck.
The outer surface of the nest- shows a
series of rings with sharply defined lines
between most of them, but the Interior
Is always extremely smooth and almost
a perfect cylinder. While building her
nest the insect is "very careful and con
tinually runs In and out of the tiny cylin
der, examining It minutely with her "feel
ers." If a rough place is felt on the Inuftr
surface she carefully smooths It out and
rubs It smooth. When the cylinder Is fin
ished the wasp goes hunting for spiders.
intense moral impressions, weird stories
and gruesome tales should be avoided, es
pecially before bedtime.-
The child should be^put to bed early to
avoid the exciting environment of the so
cial circle, of animated conversation and
convivial jollity. The evening meal should
be a light one,' both as to quantity and
quality of food and drink, avoiding hlghly
spiced relishes and stimulating drinks.
The chamber should be spacious and well
ventllated, the bed not too soft and with
out too much bed clothing. Perfect mus
cular relaxation, avoidance of false posi
tions and perfect freedom, all compression
interfering with. respiration or Circulation
must be avoided. The feet ought to be
warm and lower than the head. The body
should be extended and- not quddled up
Into a ball. "When the bed is in an alcove
or surrounded by heavy curtains night
mare is sure to lurk within, for they pre
vent the free circulation of air. and the
brain Is stupefied, as It were. -by laugh-
Ing gas produced by the sleeper, the air
vitiated, by* him being breathed over and
over again.
The bed ought to j be slightly Inclined
from head to foot,, but the proper eleva
tion of the head varies according to tem
perament. Anaemic people need to have
the head quite low. but full-blooded peo
ple resUeasier It the head Is higher. An
excitable.. congested brain may. be relieved
by warm baths, tonics and anti-spasmod
ics like the bromides and valerian. If there
Is a tendency to palpitation the person
should He upon the right side; If the liver
is disordered by chronic digestive troubles
the person should He on the left side. The
stomach should' be iii good condition, es-
peclally If there Is flatulence due to gas
tric torpidity, leading to fermentation of
food, and dilation of the stomach should
be energetically treated.
In Bacon's "Natural History." which la
quaintly worded and based. on very crude
knowledge of natural history, as It Is un
derstood to-day, the author says, with a
grain of truth, "mushrooms cause the in
cubus of mare In the stomach." The same
might be said of Welsh rarebits and sim
ilar indigestible delicacies eaten just be
fore retiring; these lie hard on the stom
ach and cause more 'horrible dreams In
those not hardened to such ijourmandism.
But it is equally erroneous to go to the
opposite extreme and prohibit all food be
fore retiring, for often a light repast Is a
most excellent nightcap, and the pleasant
est and safest remedy against- Insomnia
and. In fact, against nightmare, for an
empty stomach may cause it just as much
as an overloaded one.
Not less Important In the treatment of
nightmare is an endeavor to neutralize, as
far as possible, all Injurious moral causes.
This Is often simply a matter of good
counsel nnd caution against the dangers
of poor hygiene and excess of passion. Tha
friends should especially endeavor to reas
sure and render cheerful those unfortun
ate beings who have a morbid fear of dis
ease (nosophobla, as It Is technically call
ed), to discourage their broodinga and en
courage, them not to give way to despair.
Unfortunately, the physician of to-day
too often scorns and neglects this anlmlso
latlo, this solace of mind, which Is none
the less often far superior to and more ef
ficacious than the most potent drugs.â In

The
PASSING
OF THE SWORD
An Opinion Held by Officers
FROId Major-General Shafter downward through the scale of of
ficers stationed in San Francisco but one opinion is expressed:
"The sword is truly a -back number in Â£b,e field."
General Shafter, like all military men, is a martinet when it
comes to following army rules and regulations. So long as swords
are retained in the regular uniform he will continue to wear his
sword and trimmings. But let the order come from Washington to
discard thim and he will be one of the first to cast aside the useless
paraphernalia. . \
Captain Benjamin C. Horse, General Shafter's chief aid, is a
warm adherent of the practical idea advanced and acted upon by
General Roberts. "Swords are truly useless," said Captain Morse,
"and I think you will find few officers in the army or navy who
will not agree with me. In warfare, hand to hand, the weapon is a
nuisance, and in times of peace, while it may be ornamental,- it is
certainly not useful." - -
"What of duels P"
"Well, it might be useful there, but unfortunately (P) duÂ»ls
are no longer the fashion."
Finally the i officers' destruction j was
going on. at such a wholesale rate that
the War Office in England wired to th9
commander in Africa that the first officer
refusing to obey orders should be placed
under arrest. And â curious to relate â
rather than' discard the emblem of their
authority many officers submitted to ar
rest. The sword has been abolished in the
field by our . officers, who consider it a
useless incumbrance. During the war in
China and in the Philippines not only tho
sv.ord was discarded, but the epaulets
also, and~the officers even tore the stripes
from- their trousers so that a line of of
ficers could not be distinguished from a
line of privates.
Only tho revolver was carried. As a
rule both officers and men were In khakt
In the Philippines, and in this plain
brown material an officer shows up no
different from a private. .= â¢'"
O\HE knell of the sword has sounded.
I .That accessory to a uniform that
N . I marks the distinction between a
I private and an officer Is no longer
X to be worn, save perhaps on state
occasions.
The order a few .months ago Issued by
Lord Roberts, commander In chief of the
British army In South Africa, has already
been followed by American and other
commanders.
This opposition to the wearing of the
sword Is no new thing. When the war In
Africa first broke out â¢ the officers were
told to discard their swords, epaulets, etc..
but they refused to do so. Owing to this
act of vanltv in one of the first engage
ments seven hundred officers were killed,
while there were only ten thousand men
in the field. â¢ -.. :
The sword Is the emblem of authority.
As such many officers express regret that
it has been abolished for field wear.
There Is a surprising difference at this
time of writing between the military dress
on state occasions and in the field. The
gold and glitter Is reserved for formal
military functions: In the field all tinsel
is left behind.
Interviews with prominent and repre
sentative army officers in San Francisco
all express one opinion â the sword Is truly
a back number in the field.
Major General William R. Shafter: Cap
tain Benjamin C. Morse, his chief aid;
Colonel William H. Forwood, assistant
purgeon general, chief surgeon; Colonel
Frank M. Coxe, assistant paymaster gen
eral, and Major A. C. Girard. surgeon
commanding United -^States general hos
pital, Presidioâ all these have one answer:
The sword is useless: therefore let It-go.
Yet 'tis a pity, too, a thousand pities,
that the sword had to die. It elves such*
"an air" to the most ordinary looking of
ficer. What Is an officer without his
sword in the eyes of the susceptible,
brass-button loving bud! . Â¦
Fancy DVArtagnan and Athos, Porthos
and Aramis, without .their Bwords! How
would they ever have served Anne of Aus
tria bo well without their swbrd3 to help
them ealn back her diamonds for her
from Buckingham?
What would the hero of "When Knight
hood Was In Flower" have been without
his eword? And what would have been
J van hoe's attraction minus the sword that
helped him win- victory from his . ene
mies? Think of Richard Tea-and-Nay
In armor without a sword!
But the sword belongs to the days of
chivalry, and, as Alexander Barrett said
Jn Munsey a short time ago, "it is about
to Join the battleax and the Javelin in
obscurity." The sword of Bunker Hill
.will live In memory, because somebody
put it Into a poem, but our grandfather's
sword will .now have a mate In the
eword of the young army officer of to
day. They will both help swell a collec
tion of swords to hang on some library
wall.
. Le sword est mort:
Â¦_ â¢â¢Â¦ . Vive le revolver, i
And what is the sword that is to be
relegated to the curiosity? Webster calls
It "an offensive weapon, having a long
strong and usually sharp-pointed blade
either straight and sharp upon both
edges, for thrusting, or somewhat curved
and Bharp on the convex edge, for cut
ting at a-Dlow."
Among the different styles of swords
are the ancient Saxon sceax, old form
English larger rapier, with 36-mch blades-
Eastern cimiter, cut and thrust sword,
-with 30-lnch blade; sabre or cavalry
broadsword, 40-inch blade; claymore or
Scotch broadsword, with basket hilt. 40-
Inch blade: falchion, navy cutlass, and
the haraklrl or Japanese disemboweler.
Several San Franciscans have fluÂ© collec
tions of swords.

In a certain degree of refinement-.it was
the proper thing- for men to hack each
other to pieces without any show of
courtesy, but about that time men began
to learn that one can kill and be polite at
the same time.
The Greeks. Romans and Norsemen had
swords of metal, the Romans making
theirs of copper, the Greeks of-bronze and
the Norsemen of Iron. Short, thick blades
were often the. only kind known.
The wealthy .classes had the handles
of tnelr weapons richly Jeweled.
The broadsword, battleax and mace
were in use during the first crusade, and
It was not until the seventeenth century
that the beautiful, light French rapier
came into general use for cavaliers
These rapiers had points as sharp as
needles, and It Is easy to understand how
dangerous they became in the hands of
expert fencers.
In "The Talisman"- onÂ© reads of the
work done by the crescent-shaped "cim
iter" wielded by the graceful, agile In
fidels.
The Mohammedans were so skillful In
the use of their moon-shaped weapons
that they could cut off the head of their
enemy without removing the- head from
the body.
The rapier, above referred to. * was a
discovery of a Toledo peasant, who after

THE MID-SUMMER HAT
VASTLY different were the bonnets
worn by the Belles of '76 in their
memorable Fourth of July from
these in which the up-to-date maid
en-frames her pretty face.
In America's provincial days fashions
did nnt travel around the civilized world
in six months. The same style of dress
and headgear lasted several years and
new bonnets were not purchased every
spring and autumn for our grcat-grand
mothiTsâhow much our great-grandfath
ers had to be thankful for!
The woman of this date may wear what
she chooses in the line of hats Just so It
1? flat.
Dame Fashion's decree is unequivocally
for low. flat effects of varying style. Thera
is tho wide, flat effect to be discreetly
avoided by the long-faced woman and
there are hats and toques of various
heights and sizes built to suit Individual
needs and fancies.
There are tulle hats, chiffon hats, hats
of flowers, of leaves, of fancy straw, hats
trimmed with feather?â a confusing lot to
choore fromâ but find the woman who
would comr>!atn.
Hats of one color have been and still
are very much worn. A Virot of pa!e
blue chiffon has for Its trimming three
immense rosettes; the brim is wide, the
crown low; the whole effect is serpen
tine. In solid black, in pink and white,
this Ftyle is especially pretty. ,
The flower and foliage hats are fresh
and attractive In coloring. but x the chif

the shape that is flat at the back and
Â¦worn oft the face,, and for trimming has
autumn folinse or roses, or both. Is a
prettier model and more popular. Ecru

White and black Is a combination much
too stylish and becoming to become a
thing of the past. One of rough 'white
straw is trimmed with black and white
polka dot ribbon, and two long aigrettes
twisted around the crown Inpi..me ef
fect. Poyennier. says the tag.
Another in black and white . is from
Camllle Roger.- It Is double rimmed
and made of mohair braid. Gilt orna
ments and extremely wide black velvet
ribbon is all the trimming It boasts.
A novelty much prettier than novel
ties usually are. is the hand-painted hat.
One from Mme. Heltz Boyer has largo
pink roses painted on white mulle draped
over rough white* straw. A bow' of black
velvet Is its only trimming. Â¦ â¢
A hat of cherry tulle has a broad band
of the same colored velvet around the
crown, and foliage for trimming.- It
bears the name Marescot Soeurs.

"White plumage for summer, hats is be
ine much used. White ostrich feathers
have become more popular than was

must have one solid white hat. A white
chip -. with â¢ a Â¦ drapery of ..white, tulle . or.
with - two ostrich . tips â¢ secured with a
dull gold buckle, in front is distinctly
swagger. , - J
Colored 'feathers, are to be found . In
plenty, but white ones or black com
bined with white seem- the preference.
For late summer very light, and quiet
toned straws are to be worn, taking the
place of roughly plaited "ecru" grass -now
so much in vogue. - "" '
Never before has black velvet 1 ribbon
been so much used. It is twisted, stitch
ed down flat, pleatqd, made un Into bows,
inserted and put in' either the under or
upper side. From the! one-inch width to
that of three inches is used. If there Is a
place to nut it a bow of velvet is tacked
on tho hat.
v After the hat. a" veil- is the 'next con
sideration. The newest style is one
In creamy lace in the form of a scarf, to
be tied behind, the ends falling down
tho backâ not at all pretty, and therer
fore not apt to-be popular. Other veils,
made of black sprigged net ' and twenty
inches deep, are bordered top and bot
tom with lace edging surmounted by
Insertions through which a velvet cord
Is drawn so as -to gather up the veil
on the brim of the hat and under the
chin, wnere a- tranch of velvet loops Is
placed. With a large hat it is almost
Impossible to wear a veil without spoil
ing the effect, so if one "dotes" on pic
ture hats veils are out of the question.
-Hats for outing wear are made of whltw
Panama braid, and stitched or quflted
white linen duck. ' The Panama hats
have medium-tall- slightly oval crowns,
which appear a .little crushed, and me-
dtum-wide brims, which curl up gently
all around; the duck hats, with brims
similar to the Panama hat3, have, me
dium-tall square crowns and gored
ones.
They are trimmed as the wearer
chooses. Brightly colored scarfs -wound
around the crown and tied at the left
of the front in a loose knot In which is
thrust a breast plume of white rond
feathers that curves against the crown
make a stylish trimming. . *
Duck hats may be trimmed with a
drapery of soft white satin and a pair
of half-folded pigeon wings flecked with
pale gray. Both of these styles arc es
pecially fetching when worn with the
new duck shirts and ' a dainty shirt
waist. '
For veiling floral trails a very fine gos
samerllke chantllly Is employed and is un
deniably effective, the while U hints at
an Importance somewhat lacking in tulle.

smart woman.
Few hats are worn off the face. Almost
without exception they are worn quite far
forward, but most of them bent upward
Instead of downward, so that the hair
across the forehead Is not hidden. Few
hats have any brim at the back; hence
the line of the back of the head is almost
straight. At first this style may seem a
llttlo peculiar, but now that the hair !s
worn forward again, this shape Is becom
ing and seems to take away, from the too
flat appearance that the low hats other
wise might present. Many of the new
hats are made with an 1 Ins4de - crown rim
that lifts the hat from the head and pre- .
vents the brim from shading the face too
much. These hats are only effective when
the brim points upward instead of down
ward. '"Â¦!Â¦ '.

The second story. "The Youngest , Miss

not permitted at that.' time to -Join the army
which, wai giving bo much. trouble to^Spaln,
but later on when the United States took a
hand In the quarrel his . impatient sympathy
drove him to the front. As Boon- as the Maine
was ; blown up he Joined . the Ohio mllltla,
knowing that war was Inevitable, and when it
was actually declared he was .among the first
to offer his services.' . His â¢ record through i that
Fhort and sharp . struggle is of the most gal
lant, and the charm of the wild and fascinat
ing life made it difficult for him to throw It up
in favor of the more prosaic practice of law.
It Is perhaps because he wished,* by way of
contrast, to bring a little of the romance of
life in the field into his law office that he be
gan the , writing of novels. "Ezra Caine" is
the first' fruit of his effort.
B. G. LATHROP.
' His publishers, Herbert S. Stone & Co.,
Chicago, have fcent me the following about
Mr. Sharts himself. It is worth reading,
for I feel assured we shall hear more from
this author. He undoubtedly possesses
great talent:
"Ezra Caine". is the first work from the
pen of Joseph Sharts. Of its kind it is a
gem and well rhows the.tiand of a pow
erful writer, keen in psychological analy
sis and endowed with a most vivid imag
ination. It is to be hoped that we shall
hear from him again in more^pleasant
vein. "Ezra Caine" is too horrible to
recommend as a story.
He kills thÂ«> doctor in as brutal a man
ner as his description of the battle Is
brutish. - â¢ .
Just at this point. a sort of whirl came into
my drowsy head and the next Instant I' found
that it was I -who was straining and fighting,
that It was I who was crunching and snarling
with a thick, hairy thumb in my mouth.
The next Instant It seems to this "mad
man that he is standing apart watching
these two figures bend and sway and
strike in mortal combat. Then he sees
the doctor force back the other figure and
reach with his hand to grasp it by the
throat. He sees this figure s*ize the doc
tor's thumb in its strong white teeth:
He looks at the Intruder at first in a
calm, dispassionate light as if he con
cerned him. not at all. _ . .
Ezra even Imagines that it is his father
and not himself standing "by the wlrjdow
waiting for this . muscular doctor to
attack. â¢ * Â¦â¢â¢-. â¢
In his tale he starts from the beginning
in the old house with his devoted mother
by his side, and with the first hearing of
things and seeing of faces that exist in
his imagination alone. From this he goes
on step by step analyzing feelings and
sensations as the madness gradually
creeps into his veins, until, in its climax,
he throttles his pursuing demon â the dpc->
torâ and escapes to the fields to run mad
ly over hill and dale through the night,
iinally to be caught at last and doomed
for life to the padded" cell.
That account, as he tells it himself, of
his flight after the murder is enough of
horror to satisfy the greatest lover of the
morbid. There is only one more frightful
passage in the book, and that is where
he tells of his fight with and murder of
the doctor. It is the maniac describing
his own sensations.
He sees this doctor come Into the dark
ened room of the attic where he has hid
den.
To make this man more dangerous, he
is not one of the common sort, but has
been raised in a rejined way. All of his
education, however, has but tended to
make him cunning beyond the average,
end therefore with his mentality, physical
power and murderous instincts combined,
he Is a creature half human, half beast.
A personality .that makes the blood run
cold.
If you want a story that will freeze
your blood on a summer night, if you are
looking for something 1 to read that will
make vou almost afraid to look into a
mirror lest you see the staring eyes of a
maniac, if you want a chilling depres
sion like a series of funerals of deaily
beloved, if you are looking for any or
all of these sensations, get a copy of
"Ezra Caine" and take it In large or
small doses as the case requires. .
There is a story that would tickle even
the fancy of Poe to be able to sign his
name to it.
Of its. kind it is excellent. For any one
with a vivid imagination it is too strong
for use except in the most homeopathic
doser-.
Ezra Caine, who gives his name to the
story, is the son of a maniac. He writes
this story himself from the cell of an
asyli'm. His insanity is of the most
dangerous sort, for it is that that craves
the taking of human life.
girl for his eon. So far everything Is
Jovely.
But Cea there Is the crafty, villain, Lu-
A BRAVE story, brave deeds and
brave wordsâ therein lies the suc
cess of "The Helmet of Navarre."
It is really a remarkable bit of
fiction, considered as the first work of a
young girl, and even when not regarded
In that light it will more than hold its
own with similar novels of to-day.
Its charm lies largely in Its spontaneity
and the rapid recital of events. The story
carries you along from nace to page. You
read in spite of yourself, and yei all the
time you well know that it is all deMcious
ly improbable.
Just the thing for a piay. and 3 good
melodramatic one at that, you murmur as
you finish the last page.
In this connection it is said that when
two installments of tbe story had boen
printed in the Century magazine theatri
cal managers all over the country came
hot-foot to capture the rights. Miss Eliz
abeth Marbury took charge of the matter
for Miss Runkle. and in due time the
dramatization is to appear on the boards.
For the purposes? of i lie .stage the book
has been literally written over for the
play, and great .results are promised. This
is an excellent point, for by this time peo
ple are tired of the cheap dramatizations
of historical noveis that have been -going
the rounds. It is no easy matter to adapt
a play from a book, and the greatest mis
take is to lift whole chunks of the novel
out bodily to place in the dialogue â a
method that is now proving its own fal
lacy.
If "The Helmet of Navarre" Is well dra
matized it will go as a play with the same
success that has greeted it as a novel. %
There are very few pages of Miss Run
kle's book that are occupied by Henry of
France In person; still his individuality
and cause influence the actions of the
characters sufficiently to warrant the title
â"The Helmet of Navarre.'"
That boy Felix, who tells the story, goes
through enough adventures to the square
inch in the shortest time and the most
dangerous manner to please the most rab
id youthful reader of Indian literature. It
is a comfort to have him tell the story
himself, for you feel sure then that his
adventures cannot prove fatal, or other- â¢
wise the recital would have been put in
eome other's mcuth. Even as It Is. the
mental strain is pretty severe, and there
are times when you nearly lose confidence
on his finally being able to pull through.
From, the first moment Felix puts his
foot in Paris the trouble begins.
It has had a good start really before -
that time, but this all gradually unfolds
Itself to the astonished reader as the
"plot thickens."
Felix serves the DukÂ« of St. Quentln
body and soul, although his devotion is a
bit shaken by the first reception when,
suddenly reporting on duty by climbing
over the side of the Duke's carriage, he is
thrown to the ground by the arch villain
To explain the arch villain's presence at
this time by the side of the Duke, It must
be stated that just at the beginning of the
story the villain is acting as secretary for
the Duke and incidentally spying out his
affairs for the benefit of the Duke of
Mayenne â another villain, but of the bet
ter sort.
The honors of hero are divided among
the Duke of San Quentin, his 6on and his
page, Felixâ there is also Vlgo. the man
at arms, who deserves some atten
tion in this connection.
There is only one heroine and of course
that one is the relative of the Duke's arch
enemy. She indirectly causes all the
trouble, and finally all the happiness. For â¢
like the regulation ; sort of the bravo
school the story ends well. You know
It must do that before you have read
three chapters.
If Miss Runkle had dared- put her hero,
the young Comte de Mar, through all
those incredible hairbreadth escapes only
> to cle in the end and lose the beautiful
of his heart, she would certainly de
\erve a letter of censure from one and all
ct her readers.
iW this book there Is no time for sur
gerjj of mental insldes â as Winston
Churchill aptly puts itâ Miss Runkle does
not pause to analyze feelings. She relates
actions pure and simple and lets' the
reader draw his own conclusions. The
actual time consumed from that period
â¢when "all seems lost" to the happy finale
in the camp of Henry of France, Is only a
lew days, but there Is enough blood spilled
per day to compare favorably with an In
dian raid In an up to date Arizona frontier
town. ...
Tet, so skillful Is the author, all this
shedding of gore seems natural enough
and the most extraordinary incidents are
made to appear plausibleâ that Is art.
On one page the Duke thinks that his
eon Is going to murder him because he
would not let his son marry the cousin
of Mayenne. Felix thinks bo, too, for It
is he who brings the Information. The
reader Is neutral.
On the next page Felix falls into more
discoveries so fast that the reader almost
loses his breath, and it is established that
the Comte did not Intend to take . his
father's life.
Later, quite by accident, the Comte de
Max and Felix arrive Just In time to savÂ«
the Duke's life and then the Duke finds

doors that cpen to catch the hero and
Felix just as they are about to be run
through by a score of swords, escapes
through tunnels and trap doors, reprieves
from death in the Bastille â there are
enough in "The Helmet of Navarre" to
make Stanley Weyman fearful for his
laurels.
"The Helmet of Navarre" is certainly
melodramatic, but it is written with a
dash and style that would cover a multi
tude of- sawmills and "real water.". The
vocabulary is not strained and the dia
logue Is natural. .
They say that to. see Bertha Runkle at.
her summer home in the Ca tskllls riding
around with the pony and cart bought
from the check the Century Company sent
when "The Helmet of Xavarre" was ac
cepted you would never take her for the
author of such a work.
But then authors, never look nor act
quite as one expects. -Â¦ v
Miss Runkle seems to be a charming
American girl who can wear her hair
down her back and enjoy o.ut of doer life
or dance at a hop with the most natural
and simple of our maids. ' .
It is to be hoped her success will not
turn her head.
Lucas, who is really i nephew of .May
enne with a bar sinister on his scutcheon,
plays the villain very satisfactorily.
Foiled in his first attempt he keeps up the
good work, according to his lights, of try
ing to get rid of De Mar and marry the
girl himself. But Felix, with more luck
than you even read about, Is always on
hand just at the opportune moment to
hear the plan and work a counter-plot. :
There is not much time in the story for

are more broken swords and broken heads

So Sixte finds that, however much he
may deny the real existence of moral re
sponsibility, while men are bound together
In a society, the consequences which fol
low from a man's actions, by affecting all

an hypothesis, if not as a demonstrable
truth, the theory that the preservation
of society makes necessary, criticism of
conduct according to a definite standard

sophical problems. As a result of.' his
studies he publishes several treatises, in
which he endeavors to prove by 'logical
argument, strengthened by illustrations
from the phenomena of the ..natural
sciences, that, as man is the measure, of
all things, it is impossible with justice to
hold a man responsible for not complying
with customs which may not accord with
his Individual tastes, and further, that the
doctrine of moral responsibility, which'
assumes that every man torn in a society
is answerable in a greater or less degree
for the happiness of the other members
of the community, is but an idle myth. .
A young Frenchman. Robert Greslan,
becomes acquainted with the works of
Sixte and "finds in them a philosophy
whose tenets'are in accord with his own
views. Unfortunately, Greslan is, unlike
Sixte. a man in^whom evil passions strug
gle for mastery with noble traits of char
acter. Accepting with enthusiasm the
philosophy of Sixte, Greslan finds In Its
study an intellectual delight and in the
application of Its principles to his own
conduct an excuse for the indulgence of
his passions. At last Breslan. finds that
even if, according to his philosophy, he
is accountable for his actions only to him
self, before the law he must stand ready
to answer for them. Grecian's career
ends in disaster and he appeals to Sixte
to aid him, telling the philosopher that
his conduct has been influenced by the
writings of Sixte, and therefore that they
are responsible for the trouble into .which
it leads him. v '

With the Wild Flowers.
A stranger in a city without friends or
guide book would see but little to interest
him compared to what the knowing could
show. Â¦ Â¦ , ' â¢ 'â¢â¢'
One who grows flowers, a garden, or
who has. time to visit any -part of the
great park with -which nature covers the
earth, is missing more than half of the
beauties of.the flower world If Unacquaint
ed with botany. That Is such a dry-sound
ing word, and so much associated with
long meaningless other worda which have
no more significance than a catalogue
number that Maud Going (E. M. Hard
inge). the author of "With the "Wild
Flowers." has purposely chosen a prettier
name for the work, although it is in real
ity a very interesting and correct little
elementary botany. Just enough to give
an Interest if one desires to study, or
to satisfy the curiosity it. one does not
care to go further. It is much devoted to
the love affairs of the flowers and to the
bees and butterflies who carry love's mes
sages from one to the other.
There come3 s human interest into the
lives of the flowers when one learns how
each of them is striving to win some flow
er-mate and send its message by a bee
who is all too busy, or a butterfly who is
all too careless of the precious dispatch
intrusted to Its keeping. How the little
flower is businesslike, too, and S^ys the
bee for Its service by giving it a little drop
of honey. Or if it is a flower who thinks
the bee is much too hurried and matter
of-fact to be trusted with Cupid's mes
sage, then it sinks its honey away in a
deep pouch where only the long proboscis
of the butterfly can reach.
Then there are the troubles that the
poor little flower has, when the ants come
stealing honey snd pollen and positively
refuse to carry any message to anybody
in return. For them the little flower
makes savage preparations for defense.
It is no longer a guileless little blossom,
but a perfect ilttle Hades on a stem. It
plans sharp stickers to gouge their eyes
out, and noxious stickinesses to smother
'their insect lungs and tangle their spidery
legs. It puts out cups of water to drown
them in and bayonets to stab them. Never
â¢believe that a flower Is as Innocent as It
looks. Even the modest Ilttle violet and
the chaste Illy are quite ferocious when It
.comes to defending themselves against
marauders.
Of course to one who is a botanist .all
of these things are not new and perhaps
not so interesting, but to the person who
has been too busy to wade through a bog
of Latin terms relating to "endogenous
and exogenous" and.-whi^h give to a
strawberry such a harsh consonantal
name that you would think it would cer
tainly choke you if you tried to eat It.
this book will give many a pleasant hour.
The author is evidently a naturalist who
studies nature with no more aids than the
eyes. and ears and fingers which nature
gave us. The result is that all which is
told in the book may be seen in the gar
den and before you have read many pages
you will send, or better still, go cut and
get some flowors to see for yourself all
of the busy doings which go on In' the
little world of a foot square, where life
and death ami commerce are' carried on
by flowers, ant*, and boes with honey for
money and everything for love.
Another good feature of the work Is tnat
it does not send the reader chasing half
way round the world to illustrate the
wonders of nature as shown in vegetable
life, but on the contrary, presents them
from descriptions of flowers that grow in
every American garden and roadside. The
story of "How the Garden Goes to Sleep"
Is a pretty one and Is just jfl^.well illus
trated by the description of a sleepy
stringbean plant and a yawny, drooping,
little clover patch, as it would be if the
author had used South American flowers

E. L. Voynlch. the author of "Jack Ray
mond." which the J. B. Llppincott Com-,
pany recently published, and of which the
first edition was sold before publication,
and of which the second edition was dis
posed of within three weeks of publica
tion, is a womanâ and of Irish, not. as
you may suppose, of Russian birth. Her
name is Ethel Lillian Voynich. Some
thirty-three years ago, she was born In
Ireland, of English parents, and all her
education was gained In London schools.
According to her own confession her life
has been singularly free from startling
Incidents, and there is nothing that dis
tresses and annoys her more than the two
assertions, freely and frequently made,
that her husband's history Is brimful of
tragic fncidents, Mr. Voynich Is really a
native of Lithuania, in Russian Poland, a
quiet, cultivated gentleman, who. not ap
proving of the methods of the Russian
Government, located himself in England.
He was never a Siberian exile, and In
England he met and married Miss Ethel
Lillian Boole, daughter of the eminent
logician of that name. Before her mar
riage Mrs. Voynich. like many an English
Erirl. spent several years on the Continent.
but since her marriage she has made her
home In London. This Is the record of a
quiet, happy life. "Jack Raymond" Is the
favorite among her intellectual creations.
She wrote It out of a full heart, and the
story would not be stayed, once she en
tered on its composition.
Mark Twain once had an engagement to
lecture in a small, town, and was met at
the railway station by. the minister, as
the leader of intellectual society In the
place. The minister welcomed the dis
tinguished visitor, and. ; as they walked
up to the parsonage where Mark was to
be housed and fed during his stay, his
host conversed on several topics and
finally said: /
"Mr. Clemens, it has always been our
custom, in this little town, to open every
entertainment given here with prayer, and
I should litfe to do so to-nisht. If agree
able to you. Would you have any objec
tion to my doing so?"
"Why. my dear sir," replied Mark-.*
warmly, "on the contrary It will give me
great pleasureâ I should be very glad to
know that the lecture was going to be
started right, anyhow."
So with this understanding: they went
to the lecture-room that evening, and the
minister left the lecturer sitting In thÂ»
corner of the platform, took the center of
the stage himself, and proceeded to offer a
prayer about half an hour long. In tlie
course of which he gave his views on all
current affairs of interest, and concluded
by saying:
"And now. O Lord, we have with us
to-night a man who is known throughout
all the world as the great American hu
morist. Help us, O Lord â help us to un
derstand what he Is about to say to us.
and to be amused by it; and. if possible,
grant that we may derive some real
benefit from his lecture."

A. M. ROBERTSON.Anong the hills a day has dawned most fair;
In hazy languor tower the mountain crests;
And bathed in splendor arc the uplands where
The vale of La Crcsccnta calmly rests.
Here Solitude in sweet seclusion reigns,
From all the elements of strife apart;
And peaceful pleasures strike away the chains
That worldly cares have forged about the heart.
A loitering horseman seeking to beguile '
In Nature's realm the golden summer hours,
With lagging pace ascends the long defile
That upward winds through slopes of fern and flowers.
Aaon, some verdant canopy beneath,
His charger reined,* he lingers for a time,
The perfume-laden atmosphere to breathe,
And feast his fancy on the scene sublime.
The rippling brooklet springing at his feet â
The silent river flowing through the lea â
Their ways pursue until at length they meet,
And, sweeping onward, seek the boundless sea.
/The glorious sea! Yon vast resplendent sheet,
Whence glistening shafts of golden light are driven,
Its billows wide the vague horizon greet
And melt into the firmament of heaven.
Before him stretch in undulating grace
Expansive sun-kissed fields of ripening .grain;
While threadlike streams in silvery radiance trace
Their winding courses o'er the distant plain.
A dreamy stillness dwells the landscape o'er,
And undisturbed is Nature's deep repose; /
Above, the austere eagles illy soar,
Like guardian wraiths whose vigils never close.
But hark! Upon the stillness faintly steals
The weird vibration of a distant strain;
In softest rhythm float the mystic peals,
As echoes from an elfin choir's refrain.
Awakened from his reverie profound,
With eager interest the wanderer guides
His courser on toward whence the luring sound
Is borne adown the canyon's wooded sides.
Thus onward drawn as by a phantom cord â
The echoes answering in vague replies-
He views at length upon an emerald sward
The' source from whence the magic sounds arise.
But vain the poet's tongue may seek to. tell,
In lyric verse or measured sonnet sweet,
The rich enchantments which this mountain dell
Unfolds, the stranger's wondering gaze' to greet
"Oh, fair is the realm where the Naiads roam,
'Neath the spreading shade of the whispering trees;
And careless and free in our mountain home,
Where the wavelets dance and the torrents foam,
We sport in the gentle breeze.
"No cares we own in cur blissful clime â ,
No wasting sorrows. nor. baneful ills,
But our voices glad rnd the brooklet's chimo
Are softly blended in rippling : rhyme
As we chant by the eddying rills.
A band of Naiads here their bower have made,
With sylvan charms luxuriantly graced;. -v-
And deep within the grove's sequestered shade,
On cunning webs, grotesquely interlaced
With drooping boughs, the gladsome nymphs recline;
While one, the sweetest cf the concourse fair,
Around whose brow the sunbeams gently twine,
Pours forth this carol on the balmy air:
"In a far-off town on the sultry plain,
With the mortals dwelt we long ago,
Till the Dryads called us to join their train,
And we followed, ne'er to return again,
;While the laughing waters flow."
"And oft on the midnight's gentle gale,
; When woods are silent -and skies are clear,
Â¦ To our wild domain do the sea sprites sail,
And we laugh and sing in the moonlight pale
Till the purple dawn is near.
J a
In startled haste the lissome, nymphs arise,
And shrinking back into the forest shade
Upon the stranger gaze in mute surprise,
Who now proceeds â his mild obeisance paid-â.
In courtly terms his presence to explain;
Then, scarcely passed though are the morning hours, ]
He pleads fatigue and would awhile remain,
To seek refreshment in their fragrcnt bowers.
The measure o'er, the queenly sylph retires \
With languid grace amidst the fairy band, \
When, stepping < forth, the cavalier desires,
With gallant mein, a welcome to their land.
That briefly since entranced thee with their wiles!
What now, are lone retreats and purling streams
Compared to glances shy and sunny smiles!
Oh, yielding man! How transient were the dreamr
1 -FINALE.
" The Minstrel and the Muse may sing
Of spheres where blooms eternal Springâ
Of joy untold that hidden lies \
Beyond the azure of the skiesâ
Their psalmodies might vainly seelc '
The glories of this land to speak!
Nor breathes the Bard who can portray
The raptures I have known to-day.
Thus joyously the leisure moments speed, \
And soon o'er earth the shade of even steals;
With vain regret the traveler girths his steedt
But ere he mounts this sentiment reveals:
For now, with sweet and winning diffidence,
The gentle spirits slowly venture, near;
While from each fair, angelic countenance
â¢ Has vanished every trace of doubt and fear.
They bid their guest the freedom of their hauntsâ
Before him place the choicest of their board.
And kindly minister unto his wants,
Till Paradise naught sweeter could afford. \

" Ye erentle nymphs who vigils keep
O'er sparkling rills and eddies deep,
This blessing would I fain call down
.From Paradise, your lives to crown;
Hence, as of yore, may peace divine,
Within your realms forever shine;
And when ye rest the stars beneath
May zephyrs o'er you softly breathe;
While angels guard with zealous love
(Your slumbers, from their, thrones above.
"In spirit kneeling at your feet,
I thank you for. the moments sweet
Thus spent within your fair domain;
And oft amid December's rain
I'll dream the happy June-tide, when
I wandered to this blissful glen;
And here will memory fondly rest
tWhere I have been an honored guest."

The echoes of the Nymphs' farewell.

LOS AXGELES, June 29.â Ora Mc-
Henry, a 10-year-old niece of A. C.
Bilecke, proprietor of the Hollenbeck Ho
tel, was so severely burned this evening
that the physician in attendance is doubt
ful of her recovery. Mrs. McHenry. Ora's
mother, has been staying at the Hollen
beck Hotel with her daughter. Ora was
left alone in her room for a few minutes
this evening and improved the oppor
tunity by attempting to curl her hair with
an iron heated over a small alcohol lamp.
How her clothing, which was composed of
a light, fluffy fabric, caught fire is not
known, but it is supposed that the child
must have tipped over the lamp, the flam
ing alcohol communicating to her dress.
The child's first thought was to rush out
and find help. There was no one in the
halls and she sped toward the - elevator,
her little body wrapped in flames. The
elevator cage was not on the third floor,
but little Ora did not lose her presence of
mind*, and she pressed the button to ring.
When the elevator boy opened the door
of the cage he was horrified to see the
little girl, wreathed in flames, tumble
into it. He used all possible speed to
descend with his burden and on the
ground floor a number of guests and em
ployes of the hotel strove to tear the
burning garments from the girl's body
with ail poss'ble haste. Ora was badly
burnwl about the hips and abdomen, but
her face was spared. The elevator boy's
hands were badly burned.

with. red. white and black festoons and
draperies, these being the colors of the
order. During, the day a number of Mac
cabees from surrounding towns arrived
and early evening boats brought scores
from across the straits. There' was a.
parade on the arrival of the San Fran
cisco and Oakland tents this evening.
The local tent turned out 100 strong, head
ed by the receiving ship Independence

Here the business and festivities of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 29.â In the case of Mrs.
Lorinda A.. Haskell against ex-Assembly
man J. K. Burnett to secure the release
of a mortgage which the plaintiff claims
was given without consideration, Henry
French, who appears in the case as the
promoter and agent, and who seemed, ac
cording to the evidence of the prosecu
tion, to be placed in a questionable light
in the transaction, was placeG on the
stand this morning and given an oppor
tunity to explain his position.
So far as his evidence i3 concerned on
the point in question â the accusation that
he compounded a felonyâ he simply denied
the entire allegation made by Terrill on
the stand. He explained the transac
tion as one common to attorneys, and
said it was a frequent practice for an
attorney to use the name of some person
near at hand as trustee for a person at a
distance whose signature was difficult to
obtain. He denied emphatically that he
agreed with Terrill to procure from Cline
the bogus papers held by Cline as security
for the claim against Terrill, or that he
agreed to prevent the Grand Jury from
bringing in an indictment in consequence
of the giving of the note and mortgage.
He concedes that he paid Cline the money
due him In the transaction, that Cline did
not take the money away, but left it in
his "burglar proof safe," and that Cline
did surrender ttf Terrill the incriminating
papers soon after the npte and mortgage
had been given. **
Court adjourned at noon, continuing the
hearing until Monday afternoon, when
the prosecution will be given an opportu
nity of cross-examining Â¦ Mr. French.
The testimony of Burnett does not agree
with that of French as to the strong
friendship of the two. Each now claims
that the other is a prevaricator, and after
court adjourned at noon to-day hot words
passed between them in the corridors. It
was only by the interposition of friends
that a rough and tumble fight was pre

SACRAMENTO. June 29.â Particulars
reached this city to-night of the drown
ing near Grimes Landing, Colusa. County,
of Mrs. J. J. Dwyer last night. Mrs. Dwyer
had accomnanled her husband,: John J.
Dwyer; his brother, William Dwyer, and
Berj friend. Miss' Edna Carroll of
city, on a pleasure trip up the Sacramento
River on one of the steamers of the Sac
ramento Transportation Company, in
which the Dwyer estate has an interest.
The night had been very warm and when
the boat reached Grimes Landing it was
proposed that the party should go in
bathing in the river at a point near the
grain corral. The moon was shining
brightly and it was believed the sport
would be attended by no danger.
Miss Carroll was afraid to go far into
the water, but Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer and
William Dwyer went out quite a distance,
though not beyond their depth. The three
were wading to the shore, when suddenly
the sand beneath their feet shifted and
in an instant they were floundering in the
water. Mrs. Dwyer grasped William
Dwyer about the neck and. thus clinging
to him and screaming to be saved, went
down with him. Her husband swam to
their rescue and succeeded in disengaging
her grasp about the neck of her brother
in-law.
'; He was swimming with her toward the
shore and was rapidly nearing It, when
suddenly he experienced the sensation of
being struck and was obliged'' temporarily
to release his hold. Instantly, and before
he could recover -hla hold upon his wife,
Mrs. Dwyer sank for Â»the last time. The
screams of the others brought residents
of the locality to the river bank, but they
were too late -to render assistance, except
to William Dwyer, who was\brought back
to life only after three hours' hard work.
The body- of Mrs. Dwyer was recovered
within an hour after the drowning. It
was brought to this city to-night, accom
panied by the remaining members of the
party. -

"Feel Better Than for Five Years."
Mr. James B. Taylor. Roberts. Ind..
writes:
"I am at the present time entirely well.
I can eat anything I ever could. I took
five bottles of Peruna, and feel better now
than I have for five years. I have doc-
tored with other doctors off and on for
fifteen years, so I can recommend your
medicine very highly for. stomach
troubles. I take great pleasure in, thank-
ing you for your free advice and Peruna."
â James B. Taylor.
"I Enjoy My- Meals as I Used To."
Mr. J. "W. Pritchard, "Wolf Lake. Ind..
writes :
"I am pleased to say that I have been
cured of catarrh of the stomach by Pe-
runa. I could hardly eat anything that
agreed with me. Before I would sret half
through my meal my stomach would fill
with gas, causing me much distress and
unpleasant feelings for an hour or two
after each meal. But, thanks to your Pe-
runa, I am now completely cured, and can
eat anything I want to without any of
the distressing symptoms. I can now en-
joy my meals as loused to do, and it is,
all due to Dr. Hartman and his wonder-
ful medicine, Peruna.
"It has been one year since I was cured,
and I am all O. K. yet. so I know I am
cured."â J. W. Pritchard.
Dyspepsia is a very common phase of
summer catarrh. A remedy that Â¦will cure
catarrh of one location will -cure It any-
where. Peruna cures catarrh wherever
located. That it is a prompt and perma-
nent cure for catarrh of the stomach the
above letters testify.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna,
write at once to Dr. Hartman, givinir a
full statement of your case and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable advlc*
gTatis.
Address Dr. Hartman. President of The
Hartman Sanitarium, Columbus, Ohio.
Prof. L. J. Miller, late Professor of
Chemistry and Botany of the High School
of Tpsilftritl. Mich., writes from 3327 N.
Clark street, Chicago, 111., as follfiws:
"As several of my friends have spoken
to me of the . favorable results obtained
through the use of Peruna. especially In
cases of catafrh, 1 examined it most
thoroughly to learn its contents.
"I found it composed of extracts of
herbs and barks of- most valuable medi-
cinal . qualities, combined with other in-
gredients, delicately balanced, calculated
to tone up the system, restore the func-
tions and procure health.
"I consider Peruna one of the most skill-
fully and scientifically prepared medi-
cines, which the public can use with safe-
ty. and success." â Prof. L. J. Miller.

Based on the press reports of the af
fair, the officials do not attach serious
importance to the incident itself, although
it is recognized that the matter might as
sume importance if the raising of the flag
was an assertion of British sovereignty
over that locality. In that event there is
no. doubt that the State Department
would take cognizance of the matter. But
as It stands the flag appears to be that of
the customs office, put up for convenience
in designating where customs may be
paid, and not the British emblem indi
cating any claim of sovereignty. * â¢
The modus Vivendi made on October 20,
1899, between Secretary Hay and the Brit
ish Charge d' Affairs here established, a
provisional line running some distance
north of Skaguay, on the summit of the
Chilkoot Pass and of the White Pass, the
main trails in that locality. Reference to
the official map indicates that Skaguay is
clearly' wHhin the American line, accord
ing to this modus Vivendi. If. a
customs "officer is ' at Skaguay he
is ' there -for the convenience of
locating imports before they reach the
wild region through which the actual pro
visional line runs. Under such circum
stances it is ' ;elt that forbearnce should
be shown on both sides. For the present
no official attention will be given the in
cident, as it is not before the department
in any form.
OTTAWA, June 29.â The Canadian Gov
ernment authorities have not heard full
particulars . of the flag incident at Skag
uay, but are Inclined to think -that its im
portance is exaggerated. The JJominion
has no customs collectors there. Iso cus
toms duties for this country are taken
there, but the Dominion maintains what
is known as a transit office , for :. the ex
amination of goods designed to pass
through the disputed "strip of territory to
the Yukon district beyond, the object be
ing to facilitate through shipments and
to prevent their being delayed at the in
ternational boundary, which laps half
way across the line of the White Pass
Railway. ,
The arrangement :1s one used by the
Canadian Government at Tacoma; Seattle,,
Chicago, Duluth, '.Portland -and .other
American points, and by the American
authorities inthe Dominion, s Usually the
officers are quartered at the railway sta
tions, ;where it would be absurd to have
flags flying. There Â¦ is : a special . office - at
Skaguay., It was not known here whether
it flew a flag or not, ;but the impression
is that a flag is not necessary to the busi
ness the office has to transact.:
WASHINGTON, June 29.â The State De
partment has not received any represen
tation concerning the flag incident at
Skaguay, where much excitement is said
to have 1 been caused by the hauling down
of a British customs ensign raised at that
point. iiv.'\Y;Â£>>': :

It was scon learned thaÂ£, though several
had been severely hurt, none were in a

The engineer quickly brought his train
to a full etop and word was sent from a
signal tower to Union station. A" yard
engine was sent into the tunnel and the
thinly filled passenger coaches were
drawn back to Union station without. the
occupants being aware of the danger
through which they had passed. The
houses on each side seem perilously close
to the brink and should any further cave
in occur they must be precipitated into
the cavity below.
A narrow escape from death or serious
injury was experienced by the passengers
and crew of an express train which was
caught by the falling debris in the tunnel.
The train was the regular north-bound
express, which leaves the Union station
at 1:08 o'clock in the morning, consisting
or three baggage and express cars and
three passenjrer coaches. As far as can
be learned, the avalanche of earth and
rocks caught the rear express car, which
was immediately In front of the passenger
cars. The train was not running rapidly
and the jar was not severe.

"it is really undesirable that things should

Referring to the Chinese attempts to

Judge Little Makes Ruling
.Upon the Question of
v -Desertion.
â¢ ' J â -_ Â¦
HONOLULU. June 22â The Grand Jury
called to Investigate the charges of bri
bery in the Legislature has made its re
port to Circuit. Judge Gear. The jury re
ports that it has found no evidence that
there was any- bribery of members of the
Legislature. Over a hundred witnesses
were examined by the jury, and the re
port says that the jurors found "no war
rant" for the accusation that there had
been any cases of*, briber in connection
with the proceedings of the Legislature.
The report states that the testimony of
Governor Dole was to the effeci that his
Information on the subject of bribery was
second or third hand, and that at the
time when he informed the Legislature
that'he had information he could not ig
nore that bribery was taking place, he
had no legal evidence that such was the
case. The jurors in their report review
at. length the testimony given by various
witnesses and sum up their conclusions in
a statement that "the majority of wit
nesses testified that their information was
based upon newspaper reports or street
! rumors." 'Â¦ â¢' ...
- The Grand Jury's report states further
that while the jurors find no warrant for
the charges of bribery, "testimony was
given that warranted the belief , that per
sons not members of the Legislature had
asked for a commission for furnishing
printing to the printing offices and for
discounts when they paid bills."
Judge Little of Hawaii has rendered a
decision declaring unconstitutional the
old Hawaiian law regarding desertions of
husbands and wives. Under the law in
question a husband or wife who was
guilty of desertion could be arrested and
subjected to criminal prosecution, and It
was the duty of district magistrates to
endeavor to effect reconciliations, or/ fail-
Ing so. to do, to inflict sentences upon the
deserters. The law has been regarded as
In ; conflict, with American statutes â¢ for
some time, but has never reached a court
of record until the case in which Little
gave the decision was brought up.
The Sailors' Union fight against the
work of the shipping masters, Turk and
Lewis, continues'to make lively times on
the water front. Lewis was assaulted the
day before yesterday by a large crowd of
union sailors, and one Chrlstianson; a
runner for the union, was fined $50 for
the assault. Eight others were arrested,
but not convicted, iewis and Turk had
shipped a non-union crew for the ship
.Louisiana, and thus incurred the enmity
of the union. The union and non-union
men are at loggerheads and serious trou
ble is feared.
Prince David has sworn to .warrants for
the arrest of W. H. Cunningham -and J.
Morgan, two well-known local turf men,
on a charge of conspiracy, alleging that
they attempted to hire his jockey to drug
the horse "Weller in the race of June 14.
Weller Is one. of the Prince's horses and
was a strong favorite In the betting until
the evening before the race, when h,is
stock- fell under heavy betting against
him. The jockey informed the Prince that
the defendants had offered him a large
bribe to "dope" the' horse before the race.
The jockey declares that he took a pill
given him for the purpose, but did not ad
minister it. turning it over to the Prince.
Weller was an easy winner in the race.
The scandal has created quite a sensa
tion here, being the first of the kind In a
long series of .Kamchameha day races.

The physical machinery of most people
often has a "spoke in the wheel." That #
is, they have some disorder which either
impedes their progress or creates nerve
friction in some portion of their delicate
mechanism.
PileÂ«> is a tedious and persistent disease
which wears out the patience of Its vic-
tims. It has several forms of torture.
. Sometimes it's a maddening itching sen-
sation. At other times it's a knot or ach-
ing tumors highly inflamed.
The only way to cure the disease per-
manently is to use a remedy that has the
power to permeate through the delicate
membranes and tissues and remove all
traces, of inflammation.
The Pyramid Pile Cure possesses this
power to nerfection. It Is formulated on
scientific principles by specialists who un-
derstand the nature of the disease thor-
oughly.
Thousands have been permanently cured
by it and the manufacturers have come to
look upon it as a "remedy that never
fails.",
You need not go through an incon-
venient course of dieting and supplement-
ary treatment while using- it. It is a com-
plete cure, requiring nothing on your part
but a strict observance of the printed di-
rections which go with each package.
It is manufactured by the Pyramid Drug
Co., at Marshall. Mich., and may be had
of all first class druggists.
Don't experiment if you are afflicted
with this troublesome disease. It may
lead to' serious complications If allowed to
continue. Get this remedy and check the
disease before it becomes chronic; don't
allow it to drain your best energies and
weaken your constitution.

Yesterday's argument hinged upon the
allegations of the petitioner that his

inthnidated by the representatives of the
union. It was contended by Mr. Hutton
that no effort to intimidate customers or
employes had been made by the unions:
that an effort to intimidate necessitated
the use of force and threats, which he de
nied had been irsed.
On the other hand. Attorney Rix stated
that he would furnish affidavits to the ef

he has not as yet made an accounting.
furthermore, their agreement with other

Pittsburg Conference Oom
inittee Cannot Adjust
.. Differences.
PITTSBURG, June 29.â A general order
for a strike of all union sheet steel work
ers,was issued by President T. J. f Shaffer
of the Amalgamated Association of Iron,
Steel arid Tin Workers to-dayl There are
over : 20,0C0 men affected. by this order and
every mill operated . by. the American,
Sheet Steel Company where, union men
are employed throughout -the country will
close indefinitely or until such time . as- a
settlement of the matters in dispute has
been reached.
Pemand of the Workers.
, . The officials of the American Sheet Steel
Company refuse to discuss the Â¦ troubles
with their workmen., P. Smith, the man
ager, of the Dewees-Wood . plant of the
company, and Earner Kline, who is also
connected with the company,, acted as
negotiators for the combine. Smith is
said to have been one of the most pro
nounced non-union mill -managers In the
country, and from, the time he represented
the company In the present wage negotia
tions trouble was anticipated by the men.
At the offices of the Amalgamated As
sociation to-day it was said that the sheet
steel workers had decided at the last con
vention of the Amalgamated Association
to ask only the readoption of the present
scale for the present year. No changes
were wanted, but there would be one de
mand, and .that was that the American
Sheet Steel Company should sign the
scale so that it would cover all of its
plants. . In other words, the Amalgamated
Association asked that non-union plants
now operated by the combine should be
turned over to the union and be governed
by the same rules as union mills. The
officials of the company declined to con
sider the proposition.
- This morning, at the solicitation of
Manager Smith for the American Sheet
Steel Company, the wage committee of
the Amalgamated Association met in -con
ference at the Hotel Lincoln. At this
final conference Smith submitted an ulti
matum to. the workmen, which was in ef
fect that the wage scale for the plants
of the company would be signed without
question with the exception of the old
Meadow mills in Scottdale, the Dewees-
Wood mill in* McKeesport, the Wellsville
plant and all other plants not now consid
ered a part of the union workmen's
province. -The workers' committee refused
absolutely to consider the proposition, and
in ten minutes the conference adjourned
without formalities.
Order for the 'Strike.
As soon as the convention was over
President Shaffer issued an urgent call
for a meeting of the advisory board. The
board met and approved the decision of
the president to call out all the men of
the union. The strike order in general
will take men from the non-union plants
who belong to the organization, as well
as from the union mills.
The men explain their demand for the
unionizing of all the mills of the combine
by stating that last year the combine had
taken advantage of its position in having
the non-union mills by operating/them
first and leaving organized mills idle until
pressure of business forced them, to start.
It was resolved by the men at that time
that such a. chance should never occur
again for the company, that it would be
either all unitfn mills or all : non-union
mills. To grain this point no 1 change in the
scale was asked, but a demand for union
izing all the mills was made .definite. y .
1 The men claim that by the work of mis
sionaries of late they have succeeded in
organizing to such, an -extent that it is.
doubtful if the ' combine will be able to
turn-out the full tonnage of any one of
its non-union mills. It'ig generally agrreea,'
however, that the real test of strength be
tween the combine and the. workers will
not be made until after the warm weath
er. During July and August there will be
no strike benefits -paid the men out of
work, as these two months are used by
saeet mills, like all other iron plants, for
repairs. After September 1, if the scale
is not signed, the Amalgamated Associa
tion will be called on for support of the
idle men.
The Board of Education held a special
session yesterday for the purpose of reas
signing twenty-five teachers who arÂ©
about to return from long leaves of ab
sence. It was deckled that with two ex
ceptions the teachers who will reaasume
their duties shall take charge of the same
classes they had when they were granted
their leaves.
The substitute teachers who have re
placed them during their absence will re
turn to what has been deslgmated by the
board as the eligible list, which is ths
former substitute and day unassiyned Hst3
combined. The eligible Ii3t will then con

assignments have been made. The teach

they will be assigned and the date of tha
expiration of the leaves, are as follows:

ADVEHTTSE1O5NTS.Argument on demurrer to the two Fed
eral Indictments against Captain John M.
Neall for forgery and embezzlement was
begun yesterday morning before . United
States District Judgft do Haven.
Neall waÂ« present in court and looked
a triflft worn and pale. He' had no iack of
attorneys and was represented by Crltten
den Thornton. Harclay Henley, John F.
Rlley and James Sims. Mr. Thornton
read tha demurrer and made an argument
lasting the wholn of the forenoon.
The vital point In the demurrer was that
tho United States District Court did not
have Jurisdiction In the matter, tlie rea
8fÂ«n bÂ»lng that Neall at the timo of the
allcK^d commission of the offenses
charged was an ofllcer in the army, com
manding tho Fourth Cavalry, and that
the offenses were properly the subject of
court-martial and, could not be tried, by
the Federal courts.- Many authorities
were cited by Mr. Thornton in support of
his contention. â¢ Â¦ .
The argument will be resumed next
Tuesday morning at 11 o'clock.

SHOW INCREASE
Reports for California's
Mines Will Soon Be
Ready.
Utah nnd ,T<l*iho -have made returns con
cerning their mineral output for the year,
and the showing is interesting. The value
of gold, silver, copper and lead taken
from the mines of Utah was the largest In
the history of 1hc State. The. increase in
value amounted to 24.6 per cent, principal
ly in the copper and silver produced. The
value of silver was $1",129.S53; copper, $2,
334,076; lead, $4,260,095; gold, $4,035,609. The
increase in the silver output was occa
sioned by the operations in the Tintic and
Park City districts, while the output of
copper shows a gain in the Tintic and
Bingham districts. The output of gold in
thÂ« Mercur district was below that of the
preceding year, but the gains in the Tintic
and Bingham districts overcame this de
crease, and a gain of $500,000, approxi
mately, is noted for the gold output. The
gain In lead was about $340,000.
The Salt Lako Tribune says:
Placer mining for gold in this State is not
carried on. It will be noted that the gain was
largest in copper ore. This came principally
from the Tintic district, where many of the |
ores carry a considerable percentage of cop- j
per, and It seems wise to eo class them. In
1899 a part of these ores carried lower per
centages In copper and were classed as smelt
ing ores. It is for this reason that a decrease
is to be nqjed in the amount of pold contained
In smelting ores during 1900. The large in
crease of gold in copper ores and the decrease
of the same metal in smelting : and dry ores
is due to a changed classification of this prod
uct rather than to any actual variation in the
industry. The decrease of gold- in the lead
ores was partially due to this cause also, part
of the gold heretofore shown as originating- in
lead ore being now classed as gold taken from
milling ores. Nearly all the output of gold
originates in Tooele. Salt Lake and Summit
counties.
Mineral Output of Idaho.
The report of the United States assay
office at Boise gives the mineral output
of Idaho for the year 1900. The increase
over the preceding year is more than 50
per cent. The figures for 1900 are as fol
lows: Gold. J2.078.036: silver. $8,468,839;
lead. J4.713.C04; total. $12,107,765. The in
crease of 1900 over 1S99 was $6,129,084.
Statistician Charles G. Yale is preparing
the estimated returns for California for
the year 1900, and has been so engaged for
Borne time. His report will Include inter
esting statistics concerning the oil indus
try. They will be as accurate as it is pos
sible to make them. The showing will in
dicate the steady advance of the State In
mineral production.
Negotiations are reported pending for
the purchase of the Bullychoop and the
Cleveland mines, in Shasta County. The
properties adjoin and are on the line be
tween Shasta and Trinity counties. The
Cleveland was last worked , by W. R.
Beale. It has been under bond several
times. It is owned principally by Charles
Foster of Corning and by the Hart estate.
The Bullychoop is operating with a ten
stamp mill. It was secured two years ago
by Jerome Childs. who has been running
it since.
The Kline and Wall groups of copper
claims In Shasta County are under bond
to S. L. Jones. A. C. Hamilton. W. E.
Lester. J. M. Day. J. D. Ludwlg and H.
M. Oorham. The bond is for $45,000 and is
of eighteen months' duration. There are
six claims. Llttlo development work has
been done.
The find of anthracite coal made by F.
H. Heald, who is known as "the father of
Elslnore." is bixteen miles from Rands
burjf. Six hundred and forty acres have
been filed on. A company has been or
ganized to get out the coal.
The boom in the Wlckenberg district in
Arizona Is Increasing.
The Amador Ledger reports that an en
tirely new lease of life has been given
the Keystone mine, in Amador County,
by the recent developments. A new 20
utamp mill Is In courso of construction.
The old 40-stamp mill will be replaced by a
new one. making 60 stamps in all.
The Tuolumne Independent says the
days of '49 are being re-enacted in tho
center of Sonora on J. H. Heale's Wash
ington-street property. The lot is about
200 feet square. Several thousand dollars
has already been taken out and liberal
quantities of gold are being secured dally
through the placer mining operations that
are In progress. The ground has never
been worked before. It is where several
building* stood that were destroyed by
fire about a year ago. From six to eight
men are employed, all the ground being
sluiced. The gold is coarse. The lot is
supposed to be a part of the old bed of
the Sonora Creek. The workings are kept
free from water by two pumps which are
operated day and night by water power.
ThB Independent says It will take two
years to work out the ground. When all
the gold has been mined the rock will
be used for the foundation of a brick
business block that will be erected on the
elte of the present mine.
Mining in Calaverns County.
Mining -work is progressing well in Cala
veras County, near Angels Camp. Many
new mills are going up and other Im
provements have been made. The new
stamps are: Duchess mine, 10 stamps:
Densmore mine, 10 stamps; California
Ophlr, 20 stamps; Alta\mine, 30 stamps.
The Demarest mine 1b being cleaned pre
paratory to a shut-down, the reason of
the proposed suspension being a lack of
funds with which to prosecute the work.
The shaft is reported to be down 600 feet.
Emll Holden believes he has found a
ledge of asbestos in the northern part of
Shasta County. His claim lies two miles
west from Sims. He has a force of men at
work.
Scrlppers will meet with opposition In
Tuolumne County. They have covered
several sections of mineral land on both
sides of the Tuolumne River, below Wards
Ferry, .says the Mother Lode Banner.
Their locations extend up stream and^Â«ov
er numbers o,f mining claims upon which
a large amount of work has been per
formed. Protests have been entered at
Washington and the matter will be fought
to a finish. The announced purpose of
the acrippers is to build a storage dam in
the river which will hold water to cover
the land that they have laid claim to.
This, says the Banner, is possible, but not
probable. There are good mines in the
land.
The investigation of the copper re
sources of Piumas County has been be
gun. The Piumas Independent says that
P. C. Du Bois has left for Greeneville.
He will make Taylorville his headquar
ters while examining the copper belt of
Indian Township. He will examine Gene
see Valley, Lights Canyon and Diamond
Â¦"Mountain.
Thomas Ewingf. president of the South
west Miners' Association, has been mak
ing a trip through Northern and Central
Arizona. He reports fine prospects and
much activity In Arizona.
CentervHle. twelve miles from Forest
Hill, is described by the Colfax Sentinel
as rapidly becoming a modern raining
camp. Many new buildings are going up.
Development Work and Bond
Agreements Tell of Pros
perity.
There Is no dcnylr.s th_t a season of
comparative quiet has come to the oil In
dustry In California. No observer believes
that there will not be a recovery of activ
ity all along: the line. The truth is that
the producers are awaiting developments.
Owing to the low price for oil they have
stopped their new work to some extent.
While the demand for oil Is increasing,
there will be common expectation of a
recovery that will be gradual but certain.
The industry has passed through the first
stage, where all was inexperience, and
now the season of adjustment â¢would seem
to be at hand. The essential thing is that
oil is better and cheaper than coal for
fuel, and that fact is sufficient to deter
mine that the demand for it for fuel will
ultimately be great. Certain well owners
have announced their intention to shut
down after completing certain work that
they have in hand. In the Kern River
diBtrict there is a falling oft in the num
ber of wells drilling from the number
drilling a month ago.
A correspondent who recently made a
tour of inspection of the Kern River dis
trict writes to the L#os Angeles Herald
that everywhere he heard of companies
Fuspending operations for the time. Most
of them have been hastening the comple
tion of the work in hand to lay their ope
rations aside. At the same time the num
ber of wells completed in June will be
double the number completed in May. In
the- reduction of the amount of develop
ment work the modification of many of
the leases has been a factor to some ex
tent. The- modifications allow two or
three wells to be drilled during the first
year of the lease as against six to eight
*vells that the original contract provided
for. The Standard Oil Company has
Feveu large tanks in the field now. which
looks as if that company was preparing
to handle a great output. The company
when eleven tanks are completed, all of
â¢which have been arranged for, will be
able to store 1.000.000 barrels of oil.
Four companies in Colusa â namely, the
Cache Creek, the Columbian Parafflne, tha
Leafed l*ond and the Falrviewâ have com
bined to drill & well deep enough to deter
mine whether there is oil in paying quan
tities In their vicinity or not. Bach com
pany will contribute to a money pool to
supply the necessary funds and the work
win soon begin.
The Wntsonville Oil Company has be
pun to drill in the Gaffey district. Sev
eral prospect holes were drilled before the
site for the test well was selected.
The stockholders of the Eastern Star,
Central Star and Diamond Star companies
may vote to consolidate the three com
panies. A meeting to consider the prop
osition has been called.
Six companies recently filed articles of
incorporation in one day. They are the
Arcofa, the Beacon. Cunard. Dlrlgo, Tre
mont and Winner.

Intense
Suffering
From Dyspepsia asd Stoaaoh Trouble.
Instantly Relieved _nd P/raaneatly Cured
by Stuart's Djspepsia
Tablets.
A Vtw Disesrtry. tnt Hot k rtUot Kedfcio..
Dr. Hedwell rc-latea an lnterestlntc ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
case of acute Ftomach trouble and chronlo
dyejvpsia by the use of the new discov-
ery. Stuart's Dyspepela Tablets.
He says: *The patient was a man who
had suffered, to my knowledge, for years
â¢with dyspepsia. Everything he ate seemed
to sour and create gases in the stomach.
}le had pains like rheumatism in the
back, shoulder blades and limbs.' fullness
and distress after eating, poor appetite
and loss of flesh; the heart became affect-
ed, causing palpitation and sleeplessness
at night
"I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As an
experiment I finally bought a 60-cent
package of Staart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
most Immediate relief was given and 'af-
ter he had used four boxes he was to all
appearances fully cured.
"There was no more acidity or sour,
Â¦watery risings, no bloating after meals,
thÂ« appetit* was vigorous and he haa
gained between 10 and 12 pounds In weight
of solid, healthy flesh.
"Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
nre advertised and sold In drug stores, yet
I consider them a most valuable addition
to any physician's line of remedies, as
they are perfectly harmless and can be
jrfven to children or Invalids or In any
condition of the stomach with perfect
rafety. belnjr harmifefis and containing
nothing but fruit and vegetable essences,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
"Without any qestlon they are :hÂ«
safest, most effective cure for Indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
gevere."

The means by which she Is enabled to da
this la Mr. Hahn's system, tor when she cum
to him two years ago she had studied very lit
tle music, and what she learned has been
done in that time, most of it since last De
cember, for before that ther* was technic to
be learned. Mr. Hahn says that his system
consists simply in. disassociating the four acts
of reading, studying, practicing and playing
which the general teaching plans allow the
student to do all at once. In the first place,
the composition Is divided into its musical sen
tences of two. four or eight measures, and
each one of these sentences Is lettered,. Then
sentence by sentence, the composition is men
tallzed. all this being done before the piano
Is .touched. The letter la associated with each
sentence, the result being that thÂ» student
knows the musical meaning before ever tho
piece is played on the piano, and the number
of hours' study required Is indefinitely dimin
ished. The practicing and playing come later
and are not arduous, as the nurd work has
been done In the earlier stages.
In the Chopin etude which Miss Richardson
played last evening the phrases took up tha
whole alphabet In their naming. YÂ«t Miss
Richardson was quite able, and actually did.
at a rehearsal in the morning, start at any
phrase required of her with apparently no
effort at all. Each one of the eighteen she
knows in this way, and wu able to begin and
play .at any letter called for in any of them.
Miss Richardson came from a small town ta
Ohio to Detroit and started studying under
Professor Hahn's direction two years ago thÂ»
coming August. Last night Â¦ she played with
perfect ease and with fine muslcianly feeling 1
the Beethoven sonata in E flat, the Chopin
etude In C sharp minor, the Bach prelude and
fugue In C sharp minor, the Arthur Foota
suite in C sharp minor, besides several other
numbers, the whole making up the kind of
programme that a student, returning after
several years in Europe, would be glad to gtva.
Yet there is Mr. Hahn's word and her own
for It that she knows eighteen other Chopin
etudes, which she can play at a moment's
notice, five Bach preludes, such as Mr. Hahn
Is quite willing to admit that hÂ« worked flva
years on when a young student, and. number
less other difficult compositions. Indeed. Mr.
Hahn says that with a couple of days' notlca

Such Is the Cigarette role in "Under
Two Flaps." In which Miss Bates is now
appearing at the Columbia Theater un
der the Frohman auspices. Of the five
or six adantatlons of the frothy novel
that have appeared within critical mem
ory this of Paul Potter's (that bears also
the magic polish of Belasco's touch) is
the only plausible attemptâ plausible be
cause of the freedom of its adaptation.
Flimsy enough It Is, obvious and ancient
In situation, hysterical In plot and de
pendent for Ujs undoubted success on "the
personality of the *tar. a certain bright

We did not like Mr. Belasco's "Naughty
Anthony" here, yet it was a reasonably
successful vonture In New York, owing,
partly, to Frank Worthing's clever work
in the name role, but still more to Miss
Bates as the airy heroine. "The Great
Ruby." given by the Frawleys last year,
â¢was docketed In our dramatic annals as a
ecenle wonder, but without other reason
for existence, yet Miss Bates actually
made an acting part out of the seemingly
Impossible role of the Countess. It was
the same thing with the "Children of the
Ghetto." for the production of which wo
â¢re also indebted to the Frawleys. As
given here the Zangwlll play pleased by
Its novel material, disappointed by its
form and delighted by the admirable op
portunity It afforded Wilton Lackaye.
whose P.cb* Shcmuel was the feature of
the play. In New York, as the Rabbi's
daughter, Miss Bates again altered the
dramatic focus and became twin star
â¢with the picturesque priest. So It has
been with all her mature work; she Is the
etar by cheer force, weight, of personality.
Put her anywhere In the picture and she
becomes at once the Important fact, the
high light, the central interest. If the
perspective Is thus occasionally disturbed,
the. dynamic values upset, po much the
worse for values and perspective; It Is
evidently safe only to give Miss Bates
the starriest of star parts.
MISS BLANCHE BATES has ar
rived. She is "there," she is
*it," in the concise and elo
quent argot of the, street, and
to the chorus of Eastern com
mendation, to the Belasco enthusiasm, to
the Frohman stamp on her genius, is now
added that which rings most kindly in
her ear. the unrestrained praise of Miss
Bates* own people.
Mr. Belasco's "discovery" cf the Califor
nia girl last season was something in the
nature of an aftor-the-event affair: not
to say, however, that it is not by his un
erring appreciation of personality that
her genius hzs been given its most grato
ful opportunities of expression. But
Miss Bates was discovered here, a full
two years ago. and her art given a cer
tain honor In her own country, which one
Is pleased to remember at this date. We
even did a little prophesying ourselves,
myself among the chorus, based upon
Miss Bates' work in "Tf.e Dancing Girl."
two years ago. which was an extraordi
nary if comparatively crude perform
ance. It is true that the "made In Cali
fornia" Ftamp on reputation is not yet
recognlred in Eastern currency, and that
the results discount tho prophecy; | for,
although the Cigarette conception might
reasonably be deduced from Miss Bates'
Drusilla Ive3, given tho actress' extreme
temperamental mobilitv. yet "Madame
Butterfly," in which she achieved her first
Eastern Â«Â«ucoe?s. Is quite another story-
In the one case nn absolute, lawless free
dom of expression Is involved, in the
Japnne.se playlet the perfection of re
straint Is required. Jn the role of Cig
trette the dominant not<Â» Is unoonventlon
ality. In that of Madame Butterfly the
last essence of conventionalism, symbol
ized to a nicety by the short skirt and
palters of the one and the slim, clinging,
prisoning kimono of the other. Yet Miss
Bater. Is equally happy in either role, and
In ether parts at apparently a direct dra
matic tangent from either of these.
But throughout the conception Is re
markable, powerful, consistent and truth
ful to the last thread. By turns child,
saint, woman, devil. Is this untamed
daughter of the regiment, her mother a
camp-follower, and herself the companion
of Zouaves, chasseurs, and God knows
who, until the coming of Cecil, whom she
has Seamed to love. Cigarette has tho
manly virtues as befits her military up
bringing, and one of the cleverest bits of
MIfs Bates" work is here done, in the sug
gestion of the conflict of her boyish can
dors with the gentle craft that the com
ing of love has taught her. Sex has been
to Cigarette an Incident, not an occupa
tion, hence her supreme contempt for her
rival, the "silver pheasant," who has
done nothing all her 4ife but study thÂ«
arts of feminine fascination, and her
contempt and the profound foar of this,
to her. unintelligible fascination, is ex
pressed with admirable Intelligence by
the actress. There are laughter and tears
in her resulting .attempts to become fem
inine, where she breaks her pipe, brushes
hair, dress and shoes with the' same
horse-brush, and scans herself in -the
mirror for the first time to measure her
physical attractions. Excellent business,
too. Is the writing of the fake love let
ter that Is to make Cecil jealous, all car
ried out with the same brilliant vivacity.
The difficult tenderness of the vlvandltre
â in the love scene, her native pride and
new humility, her pathetic fear of her old
life, her passion of delight when her lover
consents to give up tho "silver pheasant,"
her mad raga when she finds him gone, as
she supposes, to Join her rival, all is In
terpreted by Miss Bates with rare power
and charm. â¢ and even to the banal "I
will-save-hlm-yet" climax of the act, is
made credible.
And of course she "makes a good end,"
as Cigarette sÂ»ays of the dead letter car
rier. The death scene Is a touching af
fair, plentifully wept over by the audi
ence, but It loaves behind a desire for a
play that enall, by right of esthetic
morale, give Miss Bates opportunity for
the use of her extraordinary talent for
our artistic betterment. One does not
care to be cozened Into sympathy for
claptrap and banality and., in her con
scienceless way Miss Bates could persuade
to belief In any dramatic gold brick that
she might offer. It is not that this melo
dramatic entourage la her native air, wit
ness the "Madame Butterfly." and It is
not safe to mention limitations in her con
necllon. Miss Bates' domain is probably
bounded on the one sldo by Bernhardt in
the "Camlllerles" and by Mrs. Flake on
the other in the elusive nubtlettes of the
Becky Sharp school, but' all* else seems
open to her. Let us pray, then, for an
other "Madame Butterfly," Interdicted by
Mr. Belasco because of the unpopularity
of the double bill, and may a Callforniah
playwright have the good fortune of In
terpretation by this brilliant young wom
an of ours, and one of the biggest facts
of the American contemporary stage.
Best remembered in that day will be
the dance at the Ace of Spades, when
Cigarette, in a mad conflict of passion
and jealousy, dances out her sorrow on
the floor of the wineshop to the accom
paniment of the drunken soldiers and
camp followers' dancing and singing. It
Is an epic of rage and despair. She has
just discovered Cecil's love for the beau
tiful English woman, "daughter of a
hundred earls." to speak in Ouldaesc. and
every change in the brilliant, mobile face
tells the story, every lithe line of her ex
pressive body, every note of the vibrant
voice strengthens the suggestion of her
sense of the hopeless contrast between
herself and the "Silver Pheasant," until,
in an ecstacy of jealous madness she
falls fainting at the feet of her lover.

Bates. Long j after the day that will

CALIFORNIA ACTP.ESS WHO IS
STEADILY ASCENDING THE
LADDER OF FAME.
AMONG the novelties of the com
ing musical season, a children's
opera company, Pollard's Lilli
putians, hailing from Australia,
will not be the least. The ap
pearance of the Pollard Lilliputian Com
pany here is not yet a 'matter of certain
ty, but the probabilities at the present
time are all in favor of their coming.
Charles Frohman gave strong encourage
ment regarding an American tour for the
company when consulted by one of Its
managers a few weeks ago, and it is all
but certain that these clever youngsters
Â¦will be heard here.
The organization is a Melbourne one
and consists of from thirty-five to fifty
members, from 6 to 16 years of age. The
children are said to be extraordinarily
clever and have a repertoire of astonish
ing proportions, including such operas as
"The Geisha." "Mikado." "The Belle of
New York," "Les Cloches de Cornevllle."
"Mascotte." "Paul Jones," "The Lady
Slavey" and others, all given in their en
tiiety.
It is a little difficult to understand the
existence of the company In Australia,
where education Is a compulsory matter,
but I understand that it has only been
permitted to appear in the Wild" "West of
the- island continent. This, however, is
not the limit of the Lilliputians' travels.
They have toured In the Far East, in
China. Japan, Java, South Africa an.1
have just returned to Australia from a
most successful engagement â¢ in .Manila.
They were caught In the Klmberley siege
two years ago down In South Africa, Io3t
costumes, settings, everything and have
generally had much more than their share
of "adventure.
The prima donna assoluta of the com
pany is a tiny miss of six years who,
among other achievements, sings the O,
Mimosa San part in "The Geisha." She is
said to be also a wonderfully clever little
actress. Another child, picked up in the
streets â the children are all of the poorer
classesâ has a natural genius for odd
character parts, keeping the whole house
entertained with her own witticisms. And
there are clever dancers galore in. thÂ«
company, good singers and actors that
compare .very, favorably with their elders,
and In addition to their operatic attain
ments the Lilliputians are accomplished
voudevilllans. Some idea of the work in
volved in the training of such a 'company
may bÂ« had when It Is understood that
alt their parts are learned by. rote, none
of the children reading written music, and
a few of them, including the six-year-old
prima donna, not even knowing how to
read and write. Yet they memorise cor
rectly whole operas, words and music,
gesture and dialogue, becoming thereby
unconsciously educated, and in spite of
the apparent moralities of the case the
Lilliputians must be considered compara
tively fortunate In their career,, when
their origin/ and former environment are
remembered. It will gratify several sorts
of interest if they do make their appear
ance here, which they will,, if at all, most
probably In September.
Most of the above rather scattered In
formation I obtained from A. R. Moulton,
former conductor of the leading Mel
bourne theater, the Princess, who is now
In town. Mr.' Moulton conducted the chil
dren's opera company on one of its tours,
besides helping materially In Its training.
The conductor, la himself aÂ« composer of
some note, with two light operas now in
hand that he is anxious to place, "Lela
mlne" and "The American Girl." "Lela
mlne" has already received Its copyright
performances in England and has received
considerable praise from well known mu
sicians. Herr Meyer Lut* of the Gaiety,
London, said of it in a letter to the writer:
The music of your serlo . comic opera "Le
lamlne" Is certatnly moat taking. The libretto
Is rood, the music pretty. You may tell any
manager I have said" no. The song "Dilapi
dated Don" is an extraordinarily funny sons,
and the patter sons is the most remarkable
patter song; to put before the public Your
lyrics rood, your dialogue good, and the ideas
remarkable. If It takes, it will take with a
crash of thunder. I will talk about It to Ed
wardes at the Gaiety.
It seems, however, that "Edwardes of
the Gaiety" .was crowded with other
things, and the opera is still open to pur
chase.

memory.
i The following Interesting account of thÂ©
COMMENCEMENT ADDRESSES.
WEATHER reports from the East show that the cold spring has been followed by a
summer of unusual severity. We read of forty-one persons prostrated from heat in
New York in a single day, and that, at night the tenement districts reveal thousands
of men, women and children lying on the sidewalks, balconies and roofs trying to
find 'sleep and rest after the exhaustion of the day.
Throughout the Mississippi Valley matters are about as bad as on the Atlantic Coast.- A
recent dispatch says: "Men. women and children are dropping on every side in city and in
country. Cattle shipped to the slaughter-houses at Chicago are taken from the cars dead, and
powerful horses sink down on the pavements and are shotto put them out of misery."-
Through all the sweltering season the cheerful optimist tries to keep cool. He admits that
the weather is hot, but he insists the world is still beautiful. Thus the Atlanta Constitution man
says: "Too hot for thinking, too^hot to write, too hot to quarrel, too hot to fight, too hot for
talking, for riding or walking â but the world's out of sight/'. s
In Boston the philosophers of the press advise their readers to forget the heat, the the
ory being that if a Boston, man can forget a trouble then the trouble ceases to exist. ' Conse
quently all New England is getting plenty of advice to "forget the'heat, go slow and think, cool
things/' One transcendentalist sings a song of consolation' to this effect:
1 ,"- â¢ Where Venus and Neptune and Mars are;
Though it's hot down here about half of the year,
It's cool up there where the stars are. !
By ceasing to work, by sleeping on the sidewalks by thinking cool things and looking up
at the stars, a. good many Eastern people may survive the heated, season; but if they be wise they
will come West next year and spend the summer in a decent climate.
HOT TIMES IN THE EAST.
\ -"\ / ITH the commencement season in our colleges and universities the scholar who pos
\ f\ I sesses any faculty of oratory has the attention of the American people to a greater
Y y degree than at any other time. In fact, so numerous are our colleges and so great
is the public interest in the annual graduation and other exercises attendant upon the
commencement week that there is hardly any portion of the people who have not been more or
less under the influence of the scholars who have been called upon to make addresses.
President Hadley of Yale in the baccalaureate address at that university pointed out the
great change which has taken place in later years in the world and in its demands upon men of
culture. He said: ''Three hundred years ago the man who left college to go out into active
life found a wide range of careers open before' him. No social 'barriers or conventional re
straints restricted his choice between good and evil. , If he were bent on nothing higher than per
sonal pleasure and adventure, *hc~ might turn buccaneer and sail for the Spanish main on a career
of piracy, or he might become a soldier of fortune and engage himself for years in wars which as
then conducted were little better than piratical: or he might attach himself to the fortunes of
some great man whose followers countenanced one another in a career of dissolute case. Any
or all of those evil . things he might do without forfeiting his hope of what the world called
success." ..
That statement of the conditions of the past serves admirably to reveal the immense ad
vance that has taken place in social conditions and in the moral standards by which men are
judged. As President Hadley pointed out: ) "We live in a f world where, the nian. who would be
successful in serving himself must at the same time be occupied in serving others. We no longer
respect the pirate, the soldier of fortune or the libertine. The careers which appeal to ambitious
men are careers of large public service, whatever may be the underlying motive with which such
service was begun. The fact that we have been able to secure tlrs degree of coincidence between
selfishness and unselfishness is- the most important characteristic of modern civilization."
The bright picture which our age presents when contrasted wjth the conditions of the
past has not, however, led our scholars to look upon it with complete satisfaction. Dr. Edward
B. Coe of New York in addressing the graduates of Radcliffe College at Cambridge, Mass., "re
minded them it is an error to suppose that intellectual culture makes beautiful lives, and that
sometimes knowledge is like the ornamentation put on an ugly building. Dr. Buckham of/the
University of Vermont told his class that society and humanity have the right to expect service
from every individual. ''Some men," he said, "have no right to live, in a community because they
make themselves no part of it." That doctrine is pertinent to every American community, for one
of the great evils of American life is that men of culture and of wealth neglect their political and
other public duties. It is to that neglect much of the weakness of municipal ' administrations is
due, and the right of a community to command the service of all its citizens cannot be too often
emphas : . v .ed.
A strong note of warning was sounded by Wayne MacVeagh in an address before the Phi
Beta Kappa at Cambridge. He spoke of the widening gap between the contented and the dis
contented class of our people, and declared that eventually these would constitute the two
great political parties of the country, the. one representing property and the other representing
labor. In that conclusion Mr. MacVeagh will not have many to agree with him. There are no evi
dences that all men of property will ever agree upon a platform of content, or all laborers upon a
platform of discontent. Upon another point, however, he will have more support. In speaking
of the growing indifference of our people for the weaker races of the earth he said "that no single
member of a weaker race can.be killed; no hut of such a race, however humble, can-be burned;
no one can be selected for especial honor for his part in such pitiful warfare, without its helping
to light the torch which starts the fire by which some hapless negro is to be burned at the stake
in our own country, not only in defiance but in contempt of law! and ..all such acts must be surely
followed by greater insecurity for the surplus wealth whicli the contented class possesses."
The examples., cited serve: tq Ishoyvv the* general -tenor -of the criticism which scholarship has
to pronounce upon life. :. It is; not without its 'word "of. warning, but on the whole it is encourag
ing and hopeful. Hardly a single address that has fallen under. our observation has been of, a
strictly academic nature. In all parts of the country the Commencement addresses have ex
emplified the scholar in politics and'given proof that' the- universities are taking an active interest
in all that affects the welfare, of the.nation and.the,people. Â¦;,Â¦Â¦;- hi ; .;
It is announced that Porto Rico can pay her own expenses and will not need the revenue

all that Porto Rico needs, and that a considerable revenue can be used every year in the main.

Rudolph, Count Festetics de Tolna, has
filed notice of appeal from the Judgment
rendered by Judge Bahrs granting Ella.
Countess Festetics de Tolna. a decree of
divorce on the ground of cruelty. The
notice of appeal was placed on record by
the Count's attorneys, Loewy & Outsch,
and if It has no further effect It will at
least stay for several months any action
which the Countesa may have under con
sideration regarding matters affecting her
heart and hand.
Loewy & Gutsch objected to the trial of
the Festetics case when it was called be
fore Judge Bahrs. They wanted further
time to prove that the Count was Justi
fied in keeping his wife aboard the yacht
Tolna and was also justified when one
morning he caused a young- lieutenant of
the cruiser Philadelphia to make a hasty
departure from the Tolna in the dingy.
Judge Bahrs, however, refused to grant
the stay and in consequence an appeal
from the judgment has- been taken. In
event the Supreme Court reverses the
Judgment and sends the caso back for
trial it would not be surprising If the
Count should suddenly appear in person
to conduct his defense and explain a few
things about which society and the pub
lic in general has long been guessing.

The Southern Pacific, according to reli
able authority, has decided-, to proceed
with the new Salt Lake cut-off by which , (
the, line between Ogden and Lucln wlU
be shortened thirty-nine miles, besides
gaining a greater directness and lÂ«ss
grade*of the track. The present distance
between* the two points Is 146 miles,
which th4 cut-off will reduce to 107 miles.
A preliminary survey last year was fol
lowed by. a thoroughly unexpert body of
surveyors, who decided that there was no
obstacle to the proposed plan that could
not easily be . overcome.
The project: involves building a track
crossing the Great Salt . Lake from
Strongs Knob, on the western shore, to
Promontory, a distance of twenty miles.
This track will be built on trestles. At
Promontory the survey runs through two
miles of rock and earthwork, and thence
to the east shore of the lake, ten miles,
Involving altogether thirty miles of heavy
trestles. The expense of building the track
over the lake will be, the easiest work
that will be required on the new route.
The lake is very shallow and the bottom
Is nand, and driving piles will be easy.
The now road from Ogden Â»to the lake,
seventeen miles, requires ordinary grad
ing., with but one bridge, over Webber
River, of any consequence. At Promon
tory heavy rock will be encountered, aa
nt Strongs Knob, which la the only point
on the west shore where the cut-off can
enter tho lake. From Strongs Knob to
Lucln Is flfty-elpfht miles, in which the
northern end of the Urent American Des
ert 1r excised. ThÂ« rise will be 600 feet
to Lucln and fle.venteÂ«n from tho east
shore to Ogdein,
Compareu with the, present Una the
ndvamttgo of grndo In the new cut-off Is
very grout, being less than 1 per cent.

Court Â»eea fit to reconsider the- quealton, Ita
decision la Wndlntf upon tha lower oourta,
The plaintiffs claimed that they had not
violated the eight-hour law when actually
engaged In furnishing the building, but
only In the preparation of material to be
used therein, which work was done out
side. Two points were made on behalf of
the plaintiffs: it was contended that the
statute in question had reference only to
work done within or upon buildings under
coui'ho of construction under Statei con
tract, and, secondly, that thtÂ» statute pro
viding tor a penalty of $10 per diem was
unconstitutional. These contentions are
held to be correct by Judge Slosa, who
says:
' Superior Judge Sloss handed down a de
cision yesterday declaring unconstitution
al the law fixing a day's labor under State
contracts at eight hours. The decision was
reached in the action instituted by. L. &
E. Emanuel for a writ of mandate to com
pel the Board of Harbor Commissioners
to pay them a balance of $1800 due on a
contract for tho furnishings of the new
postonlce building at the, ferry. The con
tract called for the payment of J274&. The
board advanced 5945, but refused to pay the
balance on. the ground that the plaintiff
corporation had violated the eight-hour
law, and the sum withheld," $1800, repre
sented tho statutory penalty of $10 a day
for violations of the'law, it being alleged
that the plaintiffs had violated the con
tract on 1M) days.

Blood Poison is an universal disease. The enlightened nations of the.worlc 1 , as well as
the savage, have been contending with this monster scourge for centuries past. Civilization
has not checked its progress. Scientists have discovered little concerning the character of
this peculiar poison; they admit it to be a blood disease, for which they know no antidote
or cure. Their Mercury and Potash preparations hide the symptoms, but cannot destroy the
virus. This disease ;s so highly contagious that persons handling the clothing, using 1 the
same brush or towe.1, drinking from the same vessel, are inoculated. The deepest misery and
humiliation have followed the kiss of affection. Though guilty of no wrong, the person who
contracts the disease in this 'way endures the same physical suffering, that the guilty^ne does.
How often is the proud parent horrified when he finds the disease he so confidently bt-lieved
had been' forever driven from his own blood has been transmitted to his innocent child; its

have long since found deep loduraent in

often.

If you want meat, and you're asked
to pay two prices for it, don't eat it. If
you want furniture or carpets, and you
are asked two prices, don't buy. A
simple remedyâ Pattosien's remedy.
Don't blame the necromancers of the
society shops, nor the jusrglers of the
installment combine, who induce you to
pay two prices for anything. Blame
yourself for your own folly.

HE chartered army transport Pak
1 1 Ling arrived yesterday after ' a
1 1 smart passage of 17 days from
il Nagasaki. She brings home "Ri
ley's" battery of the Tenth Artil
lery. This is the battery which did such
excellent service before Peking, and It
' was while leading an attack on the walls
of the Chinese capital that Captain Riley
was killed. Captain T. J. Ridgway is npw
: In command of the battery.
From China the battery went to Ma
nila and there the men gave up their
Â¦ horses and guns and were sent home. The
Pak Ling brings home 136 enlisted men of
I the Tenth Artillery, ten discharged sol
diers, 102 discharged teamsters 'and civil
: ian employes, five clerks, five members of
Â¦ passengers:
the hospital corps and the following cabin
Captain T. J. Ridgeway, First Lieutenants
H. R. Burs-ess. C. P. Summerall. M. McClosky,
A- J. Bowley; H. Q. G. Schmidt, surgeon;
Captain T. P. Switier, Twenty-eighth Infan
try: H. TJri. veterinary eurgeon; C. S. Fraser
and T. J. Lee, electricians.
Besides these the Pak Ling broughtover
seventeen stowawavs. All of them pot
ashore early yesterday morning and the
officers of the transport were nothing the
â¢wiser. . The teamsters, packers and dis
charged soldiers kept the men hid during
the entire trip. Two of the stowaways
are deserters from the British man-of-
Trax Goliath, two are deserters from the
Russian army In China, one is a deserter
from the British regiment cf Sikhs in
China and twelve are discharged United
States soldiers. All of the men save three
or four stowed away at Nagasaki.
Quartermaster Captain Davis of the Pak
Ling had his hands full during the voy
age. The teamsters, packers and other
discharged employes did not like their
quarters (the Pak Ling- is fitted out as a
horse transport). Neither did they like
the food, and they did not scruple about
Baying so. In consequence there was one
clash after another throughout the voy
age and the "brig" was never without at
least half a dozen occupants. As soon as
the - anchor was down there was a rush
to get ashore and an hour after the trans
port arrived the teamsters, packers and
etowaways were scattered all over the
city.
The Pak Ling comes home in splendid
condition. She Is the fastest freighter on
the coast, as her run of 26 days from Ma
nila, via Nagasaki, shows. She will be
released by the Government to-morrow
anfl will probably go north to enter the
Oriental trade.

Ing from youthful folly, premature lost

of citizens and the organization Â¦ of dis
trict clubs. The officers of the league are
endeavoring to convince the Board of Su
pervisors that Tuesday, August 13, the
day of the primary election, should be de
clared a legal holiday. The Judiciary Com
mittee of the board holds that an after
noon holiday would give ample time for
voting. Officers of the league, however,
direct the board's attention to the fact
that August 13 is collection .day. The,
league's suggestion of a legal holiday of
the 13th, if carried out, would make Aug
ust 14 collection day. The league is ex
tremely desirous that all citizens, and
especially all citizens belonging to the
Republican party, should participate in
the election of delegates to the nomin
ating conventions. The Primary League
is exerting its power and influence to
bring the best men forward to serve in
the convention of the Republican party.
To make sure of the election of good men
a lar.are vote nt " the primary polls Is
deemed necessary. The Supervisors are
therefore urged to declare August 13 a
legal holiday. If the merchants, working
men and taxpayers generally remain away
from the polls the bosses and place-hunt
ers may muster sufficient strength to car
ry several districts,*

Wilson, as a representative of the Inter
national Association of Machinists, Is ac
credited to Cheyenne. He is just out from
the International council that met at To
ronto, Canada, about ten days ago, and
ln course of time may be an aspirant for

Everything is not "as harmonious as it
might be in the ranks of the strikers.
While Wilson is apparently keeping In the
background, local leaders seem to fear his
participation in strike affairs, because
they remember his participation in other
and possibly more disastrous strikes.
It was a case of now you see Wilson
and now you don't during the day. Ac
cording to the reports of the leaders of
the Iron Trades Council he was there dur
ing the afternoon and got out "of the
Emma Spreckels building by means of the
fire escape. There was a meeting there
during the afternoon at which Wilson was
present. Guided by Secretary Wisler, he
â¢was led to some point not given. He dis
appeared as mysteriously as he floated
in.
All efforts to locate Thomas L. "Wilson,
fourth vice president of the International
Association of Machinists, have proved
futile. Wilson arrived on Friday- night,
and according to Secretary "Wisler of the
local association, he ensconced himself in
the house of an unnamed friend whose
abode was variously located on Kentucky
street, Connecticut street, and other
streets in the Potrero.
Eight bills of complaint were filed ln

SEEKS TO AVOID NOTORIETY
ALAMEDA. June 29.â Paul Bord

mind and pluck . rescued one
companion, Samuel - Nathan.
from drowning in the tidal canal
last night and nearly succeeded in saving
the life of another. . Claude Smith, is a
modest hero of H years. He is not overly
impressed with the important part he
took in the playful but fatal struggle of
Xathan and Smith in the boat above the
deep waters of the channel, and asserts
that under similar conditions he would
again do likewise.
"When I saw Sam and Claude had' turn
bled Into water that I knew was away
over their heads I jumped from the boat
and swam out to help them, as neither
could swim much." said young Bordwell.
"When I got near them they were locked
together and struggling for dear life-
Sam grabbed me around the neck and all
three of us went under. When we came
up Sam was so weak that I shook him
off. Arthur Gtitt. who was in the boat.
worked it over near us. I caught hold of
the stern with one hand and with the
other I grasped Sam by the fingers of his
right hand and hauled him to the sur
face. Gott and I dragged him into . the
boat, where he fainted.
"I saw Claude's arms wave above tho
water a couple of times, but before I
could get back to him he went down and
that was the last of him."
At noon to-day the body of Claude
Smith was recovered by Rafael Robles
and Edward Schroeder, two youngsters,
who used a grappling hook in searching.
The remains were found close to the place
where the unfortunate youth was
drowned. They were taken to the local
Branch Morsue. Coroner H. B. Mehr
-man held an inquest thia evening. The
jury returned a verdict of accidental
death, due to submersion.

A PESTIFEROUS GEHM.
Burrows Up the Scalp Into .Dandruff
and Saps the Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair as
a rule do not know that it is the result
of dandruff, which is caused by a pestifer-
ous parasite burrowing up the scalp as It
dies down to the/sheath in .which the hair.
Is fed in trie' scalp. Before long the hair
root is shriveled up and the hair drops
,out. If the work of the germ is not de-
stroyed hair keeps thinning till baldnoss
comes. The only way to cure dandruff is
to kill the germ, and until now there has
been no hair preparation that would do it;
but to-day dandruff is easily eradicated by
Newbro's Herpicide. which makes the hair
glossy and soft as silk. ,"

TURLOCK SUIT
DECISION GIVEN
Judge Lorigan Decides
in Favor of Bond- (
holders. -
-: â .*_ â ; .., â¢
The famous Turlock Irrigation District
case has been decided' by Judge Lorigan
of Santa Clara County, sitting at Modesto
for Judge Minor, lnjavor of .the district
as against the complaining landowners.
Bonds .to the value of $1,200,000 \ were in
volved in the suit. . . \\
, The action was, a case to determine the
right of the land owners to restrain the
sale of property for assessments levied to
pay interest on the bonds.'
In deciding the case Judge Lorigan has
filed an elaborate opinion, .covering forty
four'pages of typewritten matter, fully
discussing the issues raised. His -decision
is that; the district is a' valid municipal
corporation; ; thut . lt:'had : power to issue
.the bonds, and that they, were Issued in
accordance with law.' He decides that the
landowners are not entitled to an injunc
tion, but must pay their assessments.
The attack upon < the bonds was based
upon various alleged irregularities in is
sue. The suit was brought by taxpayers
against the district, but the bondholders
intervened and aided the district in its de
fense. 1 . , .Â¦ Â¦ .
Following are portions of the decision:
The law" as to the legality of municipal
bonds, when applied In a suit brought by a
taxpayer to enjoin the Issue of bonds : which
are still in the hands and under the control
cf the district officers, is quite different from
the law which Is to i be applied when the suit
Is one where the question , of .validity Is. raised
between the taxpayer j and one who holds the
bonds after they have rbeen issued and dis
posed of' by the district and claiming to be a
bona fide holder \thereof. ., *,.;,. ; .,,...,.
Responsibility of Purchaser.
And in this regard It is. Insisted In this ac
tion, on behalf of*the intervening bondholders,
that.iflfls true.-asa-proposition of law, that
before the- bonds were Issued by the district
a taxpayer , could attack 1 their I legality for Ir
regularities or " In the steps, taken
preliminary to their : issue, yet, alter their
sale and t'ellvery by the district, any party
acquiring them in good faith in the ordinary,
course of business and for. value, and without
knowledge of any irregularity or illegality .In
their issue, holds them free from any right of
either the district or taxpayer thereof to (ques
tion their validity oh account*- of ; such defects'
or irregularities. Â¦-Â».: , ! , i
' I am of Â¦ the opinion that where bond*.: are
payable to .bearer, -and on their face recite
that- they are issued by virtue of the provisions
of a: specified act of 'the Legislature, that the
purchaser is not required to make any inquiry
further than to ascertain whether the specified
act gives power to issue. them. â¢ â¢ â¢ .
j - :-Â¦ - Money- Properly^ Spent. 3 .Â¦ j
There Is no pretense but^he bonds were sold;
for all they, were worth, and that every dollar;
of the â¢ money went ; to establish an irrigation
system, complete and. effective in its general
a-nd largely in its special details, and equal
to If not better than any in the land. .
This system is in active operation and is
conferring: < vast benefits on those who are
taking advantage of its. existence. ' ' .
The assessments levied have been paid by
all. the taxpayers with the exception of these
plalntlff8, and probably a few. others* They
are levied to pay. interest "on bonds issued for
rtoney actually expended in-' constructing the
Irrigation ! work. . There is no suggestion that
these moneys have been : squandered ; or that
the district , officers have not expended every
dollar receivedâ upward of a millionâ fairly
and. honestly. "Under these circumstances
court' should Â¦â¢Â¦ not- favor suitors who seek to
repudiate obligations; while they enjoy the
benefilts. â¢â¢â¢ ?_,.;, Â¦Â¦ '
- Jt Is well. ? occasionally, to recall the fact
that there is no more reason, to permit ami-'
nicipal government, either through its- officers
or the taxpayers, to repudiate its Â¦ solemn Â¦" ob
ligations than there Is to permit an Individual
to do so. Good faith and- fair dealings should
be exacted of the one : equally with the ; other.
The Board of Public "Works will Bubmit
a report of Its Building Bureau to the
Board of Supervisors to-morrow, Bbowlng
that during the last fiscal year there were
Issued 1204 permits for the building of new

ing her with causing a child to suffer
pain. She was released on cash bail. The
arrest was made by Officer McMurray of
the California Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children.
The complaining witness la Carl Peter
son. 10 years of age, whose parents live
at C28 Lombard street. The yards of the
two families adjoin each other and the
boy alleged thaL while he was in his yard
playing ball wltn Johnnie Young, a neigh
bor's boy, about ten days ago, the ball
was knocked over the fence into the
Vaccari premises. Carl climbed up a pole
alongside the fence to get over to recover
the ball, when, he says, Mrs. Vaccari
came out on her porch and threw a pan
of boiling water on his shoulders. He
was afraid to tell his parents, for fear of
getting a beating 1 , and it was not till Fri
day that Mrs. Peterson discovered that
the boy's back from shoulder to shoulder
was blistered. Then he told what Mrs.
Vaccari had done. The boy suffered con
siderable-pain, but bore it rather than
get a beating from his father. Mrs. Peter
son exposea his back, which was very
much inflamed and blistered, but showed
signs of healing.
Mrs. Vaccari when arrested denied that
she had thrown any boiling water at the
boy. She said her daughter, a girl about
10 years of age, threw some cold water at
him about ten days ago because he was
climbing up the pole to steal their plants.
She had warned Mrs. Peterson several
times to keep the boy away from the
plants and admitted that about a year
ago she said that unless he stopped she
would throw boiling water at him but
she did not mean it. Her daughter had
seen the boy bathing at the beach last
Sunday and (here _was then nothing
wrong with his back, she said.
Mrs. Virginia Vaccari

Deed.

The most remarkable year on record In
the history of coinage of money closed
last nicht at the United States Mint in
this city, the business for the year
amounting to the enormous total of $80,
211,426.
These figures represent the value of
gold and silver coins made at the local
Mint and statistics show that In no other
mint in the world has there ever been so
great an output of currency.
The record was previously held by the
Philadelphia Mint, where In 1881 coins to
the value of $76,000,000 were struck. Liast
year the business of the San Francisco
Mint was $54,000,000, and the big Increase
in business. for the closing fiscal year Is
a source of pride to the ortlclals of Uncle
Sam's money-making establishment.
Statistics /as to the work ; done in the
various departments will not be complete
for some days, but Colonel H. P. Bush,
chief statistician of the Mint, was able to
furnish some very intersetlng data yes
terday. The colonel Â¦ expects to work
night and day until" the records are readv
-to be made public. â¢
During the fiscal year ending last night
the coinage at the Mint was as follows:
gold. .
Double e&sles $30,570,000
Eagles â¢ 14,U2.0C0
Half-eagles 9,800,000
' Gold total ;....' :... .$74,482,500

Dollars $4,888,000
Halves i.'.'N 450,000
Quarters â¢ 128.1Ci>
Dimes 262,760
Silver total .$5,728.926
Gold and silver total ......|S0,2n,42Â«
During the year more ' than $20,000,000
came from the Seattle Assay Offlcv, the
bulk of it being gold .from the Klondike
fields. Nome and other fields contributed
about $5,000,000 of this amount.
Local banks imported from Australia
$1C,000,000 in English sovereigns, which
were sent to the Mint and' recoined into
American gold. currency.
The stock of gold on hand in the vaults
of the> Mint amounts to a- little moreÂ«than
$50,000,000. Of this reserve $45,000,000 was in
coin and was recently counted by the ex
perts. / Â¦ ' " .Â¦ -â
The vaults of the Mint also contain $55,
000,000 In silver coin and bars. The stock
of silver was counted four years ago, and
since that time has reposed in sealed steel
chambers. . ... ..Â¦.,.â¢
' The interesting work of cleaning â¢ the
chimney flues and floors was being car
ried en yesterday. Quite a sum of gold
dust is found every year when this work
is done, and pending the cleanup ' visitors
are not allowed in.'the Mint. ; . . ~
The Selby Smelting Company sent a
large quantity of gold to the Mint during
the last year for coinage. This gold rep
resented the output of mine& in this State
and also of discoveries In Alaska and the
British Northwest territories. "
The Mint will be open again for visitors
on and after July 5. .

. F. S. Stratton, Collector of the Port,
has gathered a few statistics to show how
business is increasing in the Custom
h'ouse -along with the growing, commerce
and general prosperity of \ this coast. A
few of these statistics will prove interest
ing reading, when the fact is noted that
this rapid , increase dates from the Span
ish-American war. â¢ : ,
Clement? G. Perkins, cashier of customs,
reports the total receipts from duties, ton
nage taxes, fines, fees, etc., as follows, for
the flBcal years ending:
Juno 30, 1897... .. |5,309,782 04
June 30. 1898 6.393,753 63
June 80, 18S9 6,603.855 26

All " vessels engaged in trade with the
Orient via Honolulu now' pay tonnage
taxes at Honolulu. If paid here as form
erly (before the act providing a govern
ment, for the Territory of Hawaii went
into effect, June 14. 1900) the i receipts
'shown above for the fiscal year just
closed would be considerably, more.
The number .of entries of merchandise
will eive a fair idea of the clerical work
necessary to collect all this money, and
shows the gradual and steady increase of
business. The number of entries for the
fiscal years ending on June 28 were as fol
lows:
June 30, 1898 19.203|June 30, 1899.... '....19, 649
June 30, 190O.....:.. 21,0301 June 30, 1901 23,174
The entrances and clearances of vessels
in the foreign trade show a healthy
growth, the figures for the last three fis
cal years being:

Vessels in the Hawaiian trade have been
in the coastwise trade since June 14, 1900,
but for the purpose of comparison with
former years the entrances from and
clearances to Hawaii are included in the
above figures.
Tonnage of Vessels.
Thg tendency nowadays is to build
larger vessels, each having many more
owners than formerly, and while the num
ber of vessels . documented at this port
may not greatly exceed the number for
the fiscal year ending June 30. 1900, the
total tonnage will be considerably in
creased, but the figures will not be obtain
able for some weeks owing to the time
required to tabulate the same.
A fair ictea of the growing business in
the shipping line may be obtained, how
ever, from the number of bills of sale re
corded at the Custom-house, which were
as follows for the fiscal years ending:
JUne 30. 1S99... 427|June 30, 1900 708
June 30. 1901 1122J
The foregoing statistics partially repre
sent the heavy increase in the business
in the departments in charge of Deputy
Collector N. S. Farley.
Chief Deputy Collector William B. Ham
ilton, who is also storekeeper of the port,
has a few figures to show that hie depart
ment is fully abreast of the times and
keeping right along with the procession.
For instance, comparing the business
done for the last two fiscal years with
the two preceding fiscal years, the in
crease of business has been 22 per cent

fact that at the recent special session of
the Washington Legislature a law was
passed exempting from taxes all vessels
documented at any Custum-house â¢ in
Washington and engaged exclusively in
trade between the ports of that State and
the ports of any other State, Territory or
foreign country. Of course owners of ves
sels Â¦ engaged in such trade ! will lose no
time in documenting their vessels at one
of the Sound ports, and thus not: only be
exempt from taxes in Washington, <but
also escape paying taxes in this State.,
A further idea of the growing commerce
of this port can be obtained from a com
parison of the number of licenses issued
to masters, mates and engineers for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1900, with the
number issued at other ports:
Issued" at San Francisco .........1079
Issued at New York â¢ â¢â¢â¢ 9 19
Issued at.~Boston........ 535
Issued at Baltimore 336
Issued at New Orleans. ; 243
Issued at Philadelphia... 228
Issued at Buffalo .......:.... Ill
/ Of -course the total number of licensed
'officers at New York (and- possibly Â¦ at
some few other ports) exceeds the total
â¢number at this port, but the figures above
show that the increased commerce de
manded many additional licensed officers
even a year ago. Â¦
The figures for the present fiscal year
will not be obtainable until tabulated and.
published from Washington, which will
not be. done for several weeks.

bond from this to other ports; 100 per cent
in entries for transportation and exporta
tion of bonded- merchandise to Mexico;
500 per .cent in similar entries for Canada
(this Â¦ latter . enormous increase ; being due ,
principally to the Klondike trade), and
the withdrawals for consumption on pay
ment of duty have increased over 46 per
cent. Â¦-"Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦â¢ . Â¦. â¢. - ... -Â¦_, â¢ K;
There has been an Increase of two In
the number of regular bonded warehouses
in the past two years (Sunset and South
End warehouses), and an increase of from
one to three in the bonded manufactur
ing warehouses. The business of the last
'named warehouses is constantly increas
ing. As all goods prepared in bonded
manufacturing warehouses (at ' present
only liquors) must be exported to foreign
countries," the increase in the number of
such warehouses is evidence that the ex
port business from this port is growing. ,
The business at Selby's lead warehouse
near Vallejo Junction also shows -a good
increase in business in foreign ores
brought here for reduction. Â¦
The placing of duty on tea has mainly
caused much of the increased business in
the warehouse department; still the in
crease in many other articles is readily
apparent. There has, of course, been an
increase in the work in all departments
of the' Custom-house, especially in the de
partments in charge of Auditor Georg-e
W. Cope, Deputy Naval Officer E. W.
Maslin, Adjuster of Duties H. H. White
and in the Surveyor's and Appraiser's de
partments. 1 .
Leads Other Ports.
The increase in the steam and sail ton
nage inspected by Inspector of Hulls Cap
tain O. F. Bolles and Inspector of Boilers
J. K. Bulger was extraordinary for the
.fiscal. year ended June 30, 1900, the total
steam tonnage' inspected exceeding that
of the ports of Boston and Philadelphia
combined; : it exceeded every other port,.
New York alone excepted. The sail ton
nage inspected â¢ gTeatly exceeded every
other port in the United States (exceed
ing New York by twenty-six vessels and
over 30,000 gross tons) ; and the total num
ber of vessels . inspected at this port
showed a gain of 178 vessels over the fis
cal year ended June 30, 1899â a greater
gain than at any other port in the United
States. ... â .
The increase in inspected tonnage for
the fiscal year ending June 30,' 1901, has not
been very great, but this is accounted for
by the strike of the machinists, which
has delayed the completion of a number
of vessels under construction and has pre
vented repairs to many others. It is es
timated that thirty or forty vessels docu
mented at this port were inspected at
ports on Puget Sound on account of re
cent instructions from- the Treasury De
partment, which requires vessels to be
inspected within ten days prior to the ex
piration of their current certificate of In
spection, whereas the limit was formerly
thirty days. The Alaskan trade caused
a large number of vessels to leave this
port during the intervening twenty days
for Seattle and other northern ports,
where they were inspected.
Thia new rule will often prevent vessels
being inspected at their home ports, and
at this season of the year the Sound ports
have been benefited by the new rule; but
later in the fall the same rule may be an
â¢advantage to San Francisco. â¢ Â¦
Another cause of change of vessels from
here to Sound ports is probably from the

decided -to increase the fighting force by

attempted to explain. '.'Some of the peo
ple about the theater have seen us a great
deal together. We play together and. nat
urally, are thrown much- in- each other's
society. Well, some of the people went
up to Mr.Mac and said to him,- 'The next
thing doing will be you two getting mar
ried,' and Mr. Mac, keeping up the jokÂ».
replied. 'Well, I guess so,' and really that
is .all there is to the story." Â¦
"it's all nonsense." said Miss Stone, as
she smeared her face. all over with, cold
cream. "On what ground could I get a
divorce from my husband, that Is what I
should like to know. It may be that ha
is trying to get a divorce from me on the
srround that I won't quit Jhe stage and go
home to him.
In spite of Miss Stone's denial, the tele
graph wires have ticked the story many
times to the East, and behind the scenes
of the local theaters the story has grown
as it has passed from mouth to mouth.
Miss . Stone declares that if there is a
divorce coming it may be the other way,
in that instead of her trying to be rid . of
her husband he may be trying to be freed
from her.
Miss Florence Stone, leading lady at tha

the story that she i3 about to secure a

ACTHESS MOURNS TE3TIS' DEATH
J&Ies Emily Lyttoa, Deceased's First
Sweetheart, "Weeps for Him. â¢
M:=s Emily. Lytton. the popular; and
charming: actress now playing at the Or
phetHn, spent a. sorrowful day yesterday
ashes of her late husband, Hugh Tevis.
It was a sad home coming for the young
woman, who just about a month ago
sailed away, her devoted husband by her
side, and the scent of orange blossoms
still clinging round her.
The Doric, the vessel that brought
Mrs. Tevis back to loving relatives and
friends, arrived in port at 6 o'clock on
Friday evening Quarantine restrictions
kept her passengers aboard till yesterday
morning at 9 o'clock, at which hour they
were allowed to land.
Mr. and Mrs. Baxter and Dr. Harry
Tevis were down at the dock to receive
the young widow when 6he stepped
ashore. She wÂ«s at once driven to the
residence of Mrs. Lloyd Tevis, where for
the present she will make her home.
Mrs. Tevis has borr.e up bravely through
her terrible trial, and when Bne landed
yesterday was apparently in good health,
though cast down with the Borrow of her
recent bereavement.
All of the Tevis family were assembled
h to meet the younp widow at the family
f â¢finne when she arrived there. The meet-
Vins' with those who share with her in her
flops and sympathize with her In her sor
â¢ 'row was a great comfort to the poor
young widowed bride. The details of the
death of Hugh Tevis, as related by his
bereaved widow, are practically as have
already been published. Mr. Tevis was
taken ill while sojourning at Myonoshita.
a little town within a day's travel of
Yokohama. Togc-ther with his wife he
journeyed by easy stages to Yokohama,
where they arrived on the 2d . day of
June. Dr. Eldridge of the Marine Hos
pital sen-ice, and a friend of Mr. Tevis,
â¢was called in and at once pronounced his
case a serious attack of appendicitis.
For three days Dr. Eldridge tried to
conquer the dread malady 7Â«r*- without
avail, and finally an operairyÂ»vas de
cided upon. On the afternoc.i^>f the 5th
of June the operation was performed. Dr.
Weir Mitchell, the famous specialist from
Philadelphia, was present at the opera
tion. From the surgeons' standpoint the
operation was a successful one. But the
condition of the patient was such that he
did not have the strength to rally, and
sinking gradually, he passed away on the
afternoon of the 6th, just twenty-four
hours after the operation.
Hugh Tevis' last hours were character
istic of the man himself. All through
his illness he displayed the highest cour
age, and when he found that ne was be
vond all help his thoughts were all for
his beloved wife. His last wishes were
lor arrangements to be made for her
comfdrt.
At the Tevis home there were many vis
itors during the <'ay. but the numbers of
the family denied themselves to all save
" a few very near and tried friends.
As yet no arrangements have been made
for the felijdous ceremonies attending the
final disposition of the ashes of Hugh
Tevis. â¢

terday morning, bringing with her the

had not Miss Lytton preferred the ap
plause and glitter of stage life to the
charm and peace of domesticity.
Miss Lytton and Hugh Tevis were play
mates. After a fasnion they were re
lated. Miss Lytton's mother, Mrs. Bar
schus, is the half-sister of J. B. Haggin,
whose first wife was the sister of Mrs.
Lloyd Tevis. The Barschus' never count
ed much on this far-fetched relationship,
only it served to bring the families- to
gether. In due course of time May grew
up into a handsome young woman and
decided upon the stage as a career. She
went East, and returned in 1889. when she
played an extended engagement at the
Baldwin Theater, essaying one of the
leading roles in "Little Lord Fauntleroy."
j It was during Â» this engagement that

Stubbs made a few remarks. He said he
was sorry to leave San Francisco and that
he was sorry to sever his association

explained that little gatherings of this

that as this feeling had distinguished the

Yesterday, a letter was received in this
city from employers,, informing
their patrons that he had : "gone wrong"
and advising them not to cash any checks
for < him,- as they would not be responsible
for any of h'Â« ohltgraMons.
It was not until yesterday that the for
geries were discovered. Charles New
man, who conducts the. Richelieu saloon,
became acquainted with White in a busi
ness way and he readily consented to cash
u check for $24 50 for him after listening
to his story of being temporarily short of
cash. The. check purported to have been
signed by Edward Harris, a Kearny
street clothier, and was drawn on the
Bank it California.
Yesterday Newman presented the check
for â¢ payment Â¦ and was dumf ounded to
learn that Harris' signature had been
forged. Newman went to police head
quarters, where he told Â¦Â¦ his Â¦â¢ troubles to
Captain Seymour. The latter at once de
tailed Detectives Dinan and Wren on tne
case, but beyond learning that White had
been seen on Market streetFriday after
noon they failed to get â¢ a- clew to his
whereabouts. â¢Â¦ â¢ ... Â¦ ... .'
Newman is v not the only victim of the
drummer forger. Joe - Rosenberg, who
conducts a store on Market street, ac
commodated White with a "loan" of $8,
taking a bogus check as security. Sev
eral women who conduct disreputable
h&uses. thinking that White was a "â¢good
fellow," gladly- took' his checks ' in pay
ment for champagne. Captain Seymour
has the Â¦ names > of at least a half dozen
people who were victimized . by the Chi

religiously refuses, to reveal .them. He is
of the opinion .that. White, in some-way
learned that the detectlttes were after

J. K. White, a drummer for a necktie
house in Chicago, is wanted by the police
in this city on several charges of forgery.
White, who is a well dressed, tine ap
pearing .fellow,, arrived here a short time
ago and soon made many acquaintances.
He was liberal with his money and In a
&hort time he* found himself "broke."
The manager of the house, becoming sus
picious on account of White's failure to
write to him, wired a friend to look him
up. While . the latter' was anxiously
searching for him White was "under,

A PRETTY wedding tod: p'sca in
I the quaint Church of St. "An

Army streets, on Tuesday after
noon, when Frank L. yoelng.
manager of the Oberon cafe and concert
hall, and Miss Anna Amme, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Amme, prominent in
musical circles, were married.
The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Father Raphael, O. S. F., in the

tired in a soft, clinging white silk gown
and large picture hat. She carried a beau
tiful bouquet of orchids.
After the ceremony a wedding breakfast
was served at a downtown restaurant. An
orchestra was in attendance during the
discussion of the tempting menu. A room
was devoted to the display of the wedd'.ng
presents, â¢ which were numerous " and
costly.
A â¢ reception followed the breakfast, .at
which John Hease and Theodore Hart-

" Plums for "the Shiftless Politicians. ;
Under the conditions of the amendment the lazy, thriftless,
scheming .politicians, who' have no emplos'ment in the regular
fields of .industryâ the" fellows who labor not and own nothing â
are' eligible to serve as commissioners, but thousands of the
Industrious in various 'fields of honest enterprise for the de
velopment of the State are rendered ineligible.
The State Commission is clothed with authority under the
proposed change in the constitution to fix the charges for
everything imaginable. Powers given to Supervisors, local
governing bodies, and. Town Councils are usurped and swept
aside. "-Here is the astounding proposition in the language of
section 21: '
"And from and after until appointment, the State

may conflict -with this section."
Penalties Amount Almost to Confiscation.
Penalties for failure to conform to edicts of the all-power
ful commission amount practically to confiscation of property
and the destruction of 'business.
Many Californians .will call to mind the great struggle in
the constitutional convention of 1878-79 for the rights and prin
ciples.of local government. All the' rights secured to the peo
ple by .the framers of the constitution are to be surrendered to
a commission appointed by. a Governor who may-be desirous
of retaining the favor of great corporations and small politi
cians. .- v
Many able and patriotic members of the last Legislature
entered their protest 'against the consideration of -an amend
ment*so preposterous, but in the turmoil and confusion of an
expiring session their protests were neither heard nor heeded.
When all the vicious and dangerous provisions of the meas
ure are clearly understood by the people of California voters
irrespective of party will charge their delegates to the State
conventions of 1902 to, proclaim in resolutions a sense of the
danger to the cause of local government. .At this time it is
the duty of farmers." merchants, workingmen and taxpayers
to make an intelligent study of the proposed amendment. The
corrupt politicians, regardless. of party ties, probably will em
ploy all the skill and cunning at their command to bring out
a strong vo'te in support of the amendment. It is a big and
audacious scheme of politicians, backed by Interested corpora
tions, to grasp the power that belongs to the people.
AMONG the several constitutional amendments whicli
the last Legislature adopted and which >will be sub
mitted to the people for ratification or rejection at the
general election of 1902 is one that proposes a surrender
of the. State to the corporations and politicians.. It is
-known as Assembly constitutional amendment. No. 2S.. /It : was
... > adopted during the expiring hours of the Legislature, and
doubtless many well meaning members voted for it under'ml3
apprehcr.slbn of its-true character. If it should be ratified by
. the voters "government of the people, by the people and', foi
the people" would perish from the face of California earth.
The proposed amendment annuls" outright section 22. article
. XII (corporations) of the existing constitution. All the powers
given to the Board of ftailroad Commissioners to fix railroad,
passenger and freight rates are annulled. It is true that other
provisions for tho adjustment of rates are embodied in the
proposed amendment, but as railroad influences, directed by
| W.'iP, Herrin of tho Southern Pacific law department, ' were
invoked to secure favorable action, on the measure now pend
ing, it may be accepted as a fact that the controlling powers
granted to the people in the constitution of 1S78 will be lost if
the amendment be ratified. , ,

Commission to Rcgulats Everything.
The proposed new dealâ Assembly constitutional amend
ment No. 2Sâ contemplates the creation of a commission of five
men to regulate everything; that can be taxed for regulation.
The State is to be divided into five districts and every one of
the five districts is to elect a commissioner, whose salary shall
be $6000 a year. The commissioner's term of office is ten years.
"But that is not all. The Governor appoints the first five â one
for two years, one for four years, one for six years, one for
eight years and one for ten years. Thereafter the commission
ers are to be elected by the people. . / ..
Practically there is no end to the power' granted to the
commissioners. The amendment declares: "The commission
ers shall be qualified electors of the State and of the district
frcm which they are elected or appointed, arid, shall not.be
interested directly or indirectly as stockholder, creditor, agent,
attorney, employe or otherwise in any of the- corporations,
companies or business over which they have charge." ... The
language in this respect is borrowed from section 22, article
XII, of the existing constitution, which applies solely to trans
portation companies. ...
The five commissioners to be appointed by the Governor
take in telegraph, telephone, water, light, power, transporta
tion, sleeping-car and express companies and "other corpora
tions." The clause relating to eligibility is so discriminating
and far-reaching that one-balf the voters of "the State would
be disqualified from serving on the commission.
The ferm "other corporations" relates to banking institu
tions and insurance companies. This Is made clear by the fol
lowing language of the proposed amendment; â¢'. i

aforesaid, the State Commission shall be the successor of the

Emperor William Has Hard;
Luck Until He Guides
the Iduna.
BERLIN, June 29.â In the complete ab
sence of political topics of interest this"
week the Kiel regatta attracted unusual
attention. To everybody's great surprise
the best result3 were achieved by German!
internatloEal-built yachts. The Emperor^
William prize for Instance was won by a"
yacht which until this competition had
sailed only orf Lake Wannsee, near Ber
lin. Several French yachts participated.
Two American yachts which were in the
races took no prize.
It must be remarked that Emperor
William had hard luck all the week till
he won the first prize with the Empress*
yacht, the Iduna, in the race for special
classes. But the Idima Is English built,
whereas her competitors, Samoa I and
the Samoa II, were built in Germany.
The Emperor steered the latter in the
races and made a poor showing. The Em
peror's yacht.. the Meteor, also turned out
badly. During the first half of the re
gatta season, however, the yachts were
almost without wind, and many of the
boats were becalmed for hours. Yester
day brought a spanking breeze for the
Kiel to Eckernfaerde race. The Iduna,
having been reconstructed with the main I
idea of making her a safe boat in rough ;
weather, gave the Emperor a great ad- Â¦
vantage over the other yachts. The Iduna
made forty knots in three hours and nine
minutes.' The vacht Is now considered so
safe that the Empress has decided to take
a cruise in her shortly on the Baltic with
her younger children. - . "^
While the Emperor's newest German
and English built yachts proved disap
pointing. Admiral Koestner'8 Kornet.
which is the Emperor's former yacht Me
teor rechristened. took the largest num
ber of prizes^ â two firsts and two seconds.
The Cologne Gazette referring to the
Emperor's order for an American built
yacht explains in an apologizing manner
that his Majesty has expressed the opin
ion that the Americans were far ahead
of the British and Germans In yacht
building.
AMERICAN BOATS
TAKE NO PRIZES
THE Germans plucked victory out
of a certain defeat in the ninth
inning yesterday by. alighting on
"Sapho" Harper's curves for five
bumps. The Legislators had a
lead of two runs up to this period of the
game and a roseate hue showed for the
Senators. A close decision placed Mr. Ev
acs on first in this inning and a base on
balls for Croll gave the locals the start
they needed. With hope In their breasts
they went to bat and every man tore off
a single until the score was 9 to 5. ' Then
the excitement subsided. - "
It was the slowest game that was ever
played on the home grounds. "Sapho"
Harper was as slow as the proverbial "ice
wagon." He tired every one but himself,
as he rested between pitches. The pic
ture of grace as he sent the ball over in
true Delsarte style forced the crowd to
yawn and wait in the hot sun for :some
thing to happen. That something occur
red in the ninth and Mr. Harper had a
dizzy time. - .
Umpire Tyler's lamps were either cross
ed yesterday or they were obscured by
"Old Sol's" beams. His decisions 1 ,. were
something awful at times, and when the
spectators were not having a hand in tell
ing him so both Pabst and Devereaux
took it upon themselves, with the usual
result. Pabst was fined 55 and then an
other $5, until his salary looked like 30
cents. Devereaux suffered worse humilia
tion.- In the ninth he was not only fined
Jo but was escorted off the field by a po
liceman. He had the hardihood of talking
back to the umpire.
Evans lost and won the -game. In the
early part of the trouble he gave so many
bases on balls that it looked as if Sacra
mento" would have a walk around. ;' He
settled down, however, and pitched even
ball, keeping the hits well scattered. He
came to oat five times and batted safely
thrice and made the circuit three times,
something unusual for a pitcher. He re
tired in the ninth at Uncle Hank's sug
gestion and Iburg pitched the last inning
in his usual clever style. -
Sacramento played in hard luck and the

came in first in the race for' the Victoria
cup. valued at Â£200. 'with Â£300 added and
a sweepstakes of Â£20, at the Hurst Park
summer meeting to-day. Richard Croker's
Sweet Dixie (J. Rieff) was * second and
Claquer. finished third. ; An* objection was
entered against St. Levan, on the ground
of boring. It was sustained and the race
was awarded to Sweet Dixie. The Victo
ria cup is a polid gold statuette represent

siderable amusement when Robert Kat
zenstein of Frankfort j on-the-Main came
in ; with hta; autocar running backward,
having made thirty kilometers from PotB

machinery being out of order.. Among the
tourists who ; arrived from Paris . wad
Baron< de RothachUd, who traveled under

the dispatches received from Hanover by
the "Automobile Club officers was" .one
which anouneed the start | of only fifty
one out of the seventy-three motors which
had arrived, there yesterday. The dusty
condition of the roads accounted to some
extent for the delay in the urrlval of the
racers here. Fournier was first seen at a
great distance in a thick cloud of dust,
approaching the . goal like, a whirlwind.
The, enormous crowd outside and inside
the -park, began cheering! wildly, and at
the same time the bands struck up "The
Marseillaise," while all the French, people
present waved email trl-colored. flags, and
as Fournier halted before the goal an im
mense wreath of laurel, decorated with
ribbons of the German and French colors.
and inscribed in German with the word
"Victory," was .handed to him/" Then
Fournier completed^ the circuit of the
track and left his autocar, the bands^lay
ing Sousa marches. -The victor was then
taken hold of by a score of lusty young
French and German athletes, who lifted
him upon their shoulders and carried him
across the field to the main stand. He
said: .- ... V;. >. '.. . Â¦Â¦ ' Â¦ â¢. Â¦:-.,-. Â¦

Acid Kills a Society Woman.
BUTTE, Mont., June 29.âMrs. Annie
O'Brien, a prominent society woman, the
â¢wife of William O'Brien, an architect
died this evening. She swallowed aquan'
tity of carbolic acid at her home on West
Silver street, and -when found was dead
fine was a daughter of the late Marco
Medln. who: died: a few days ago. The
Coroner's Jury returned a verdict ot ac
cidental death.
It took one hour to play four innings yester
day. The day was sultry and the players
seemed to be In a lazy mood.
Croll "and Schwartz were struck out in sue
â¢cession by Harper.. "Sapho 1 " also scalped
Pabst. and the "fans" howled in merry glee.
Croll went Into the game with a stiff neck,
but It did not prevent him from taking many
In center garden.
'"Sapho" delayed the Eame by posing. He
was as graceful as a ballet dancer and as de
liberate as a man with "charley-horse."
Hildebrand is undoubtedly the best hunter in
the league. His eye is so true that he can
bunt at will.
As soon as a player writes for a paper his
team loses. As an instance of this Matthewson
pitched winning, ball until he put pencil to
paper. Hodson lost his first game. "Brick"
Dovereaux tried It yesterday, but the Jonah
was there. His team lost the game when
victory was theirs; he was fined $5 and than
escorted out of the prame by a policeman.
Pabet and "Brick" shook hands, ,both hav
ing been ftned and put out of the game. Â¦
Bvans lort and won his game yesterday. He
contributed to SacramÂ«nto'Â» inoraentcrv â¢â¢â¢?/..
cess by allowing the Senators to walk, j then
steadied down, pitched good ball ana niaae
three runs on throe nice swats.
Francks robbed Bowman of â¢ a hit and the
Angela of a run by â¢ a sensational catch on
Thursday. ;.\v.Â» Â¦
Jor.es showed the home guard th.at he can
pitch good ball. On Thursday his work was
faultless and the victory virtually belonged
to him. '. . . .
Two hours and a half Is too long for a game.
The. managers of both teams should feed their
players on ginger.
Five of â¢ the Â«1* errors In Thursday's game
were on fly bulls. Dunleavy and Brockhoff
made, inexcusable muffs, Reilly went too far
under a high fly and Kelly and Francks drop
ped l'ners. â¢ . ,
Hodson Is not a youn* player bv any means.
Old man Graves caught .him in Buffalo as far

that he -was given his release after yes
terday's game. Tyler was conscientious
in his umpiring and tried to give just de

"orb" brought him into disrenute with
the spectators. It is thought that Rtibe
will be the right man in the right place.
He has umpired many games, is an old

"War Eagle Is Heavily Backed
to Win the Reserve
Final.
In the run-down of the Reserve stake
at TTnion Park yesterday dogs that were
on the short end in the betting figured
<iuite extensively and made the day an
tinpleasant one to the bettors who give
x>dds that their judgment is right. In all
twelve favorites were beaten, and In every
.instance the short end that caused the
"upset was at least a 3 to 1 shot The
bunch averaged 4 to 1, an extraordinary
showing.
On two occasions Santonin gave his
backers a chance to say unpleasant things
of â¢ his cualiflcations as a courser. The
dog's first failure was in his course- with
Jingle Bells. Ten to 1 was offered that
Santonin would get the flag, but after a
short course he was declared a loser by a
score of 1 to 3. On accoupt of the with
drawal of McKinley near the finish of tha
cay's sport Santonin was sent to the slips
as the bye dog to compete with Lord Bea
consfield. Once acain he was made a fa
vorite, this time at 3 to 1, and once again
did he fail to make good to the ones who
played him.
Algie McDonald beat Vixen, a bye dog,
at 5 to 1; May Hempstead beat Tea Rose,
Oolden Russet beat Spiteful, Tom Hur
leck beat Tapioca, at 4 to 1; Master Work
man beat Fontenoy, Royal Anne beat
Strayaway, Cash beat Freeze Out in a bye,
Thelma beat Thornhill. Swedish beat
King's Borderer and ; Kound About beat
Black Head, at 3 to L
"War Eagle is well played for the stake
at 5. Tyrone Prince, at the top of the
.card, is quoted at 6. He is in a good posi
tion on the card and considering his re
cent good work should finish close to the
money, unless Mayflower beats him in the
third round. Rocker and Hot Haste are
not without backing. The Grafter Is held
>at 7 and King Cotton at 8." Narcissus, at
5 to 1, is at top price witn War Eagle,
though not so Heavily played.
â¢ Likely winners in the second round are
Tyrone Prince, Mayflower, Shadow, Chi
cago Boy, Candelaria, Buck, Frisco Lad,
Loyal Lad. Silver Cloud. Rocker, Master
Rocket, N'ora. Agamemnon. Vulcan. Echo,
War Eagie, The Grafter, Talk to Me, Nar
cissus, Roval Flash, Greenhall. Freeze
Out, Lilac. Honor Bright, Ever Sure,
Flower of Gold, Round About and King
Cotton.
In the Champion Reserve event Rector,
"who has the epeed over any in the stake,
is the choice, and it looks as if he will
contest for the last flag with the winner
cf the Little Sister-Harlean Gladys
course. Lujcor Is at top figures, but will
have to show much above his form of last
vreek to keep in the chase.
For a good outside chance. Fine Fire is
worth noticing. He has been trying hard
and his failure to reach the finals has
been because of bad luck.

ST LOUIS, June 29.-The getaway at the
Fair Grounds was marked by. one of the
most threatening- demonstrations ever
witnessed on a racetrack in thlg city. The
trouble was caused by the unsatisfactory
running: in the fifth 'race, in which Varro,
Chappaqua and Peaceful were figured as
the principal contenders. Varro was made
a redhot favorite at 13 to 10, with Chap
paqua well backed at 14 to 5. Three to
one was chalked up against Peaceful.
Starter . Bruen shocked the backers of
Varro and Chappaqua by letting Peace
ful off with a flying start, not dropping
Ws flag until that horse was beyond the
timo nag. The crowd yelled in derision
as Peaceful opened up .a big gap. The
other contenders never had the ghost of
a chance to win. Peaceful led into the
stretch .by eight lengths and won, pulled
"!>â¢ i>y haI * that distance from Varro.
Hundreds of angry men surrounded the
Judges stand, demanding that Peaceful
?o set back, and crying. "Thieves!"
Robbers!" and other like terms, while
nis.ses could be Â¦ heard throughout the
grounds. Peaceful is owned by C. J.
Cella, a brother of one of the proprietors
of the racetrack, and this fact was strong
ly commented on. Racing will be re
sumed at Delmar Monday. Results:

MRS. BOTKIN'S ATTORNEYS
OUTLINE THEIR PLANS
The Time for the Second Trial Has
Not Yet Been Peremptorily
Set.
The case of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,
charged with the murder of Mrs. Dunning
and Mrs. Deane of Dover, Del:, by send
ing poisoned candy to them through the
mails, was" again called in Judge Cook's
court yesterday to be peremptorily set for
the second trial. Attorney Charles Heg
eerty asked for a further continuance till
July 15, as his law partner, George A.
Knight, was still suffering from the ef
fects of the accident last Monday, and as
he was chief counsel .in -the case he
thought the motion ' for a continuance
should be granted to enable Mr. Knight
to complete the papers necessary to carry
the case to the highest court on the ques
tion of jurisdiction. He said the defense
would first petition, the Superior Court for
the defendant's release on a writ of
habeas corpus, which would probably be
denied; the appeal would then be taken
to the Supreme Court and from there to
the Federal courts. Â¦- â¢
District Attorney Byington opposed the
motion for a continuance. He contended
that the defense had been given ample
time to prepare all the papers needed to
appeal to the Federal courts, and he
thought the case should be peremptorily
set for trial. The Judge, however, de
cided to grant the continuance. Mrs. Bot
kin was in court, attended by her sister.

DEPUTIES AT ROME
HAVE LIVELY SESSION
cultural Strikers Ended by a
Speedy Adjournment.
Debate About the Killing of Agri-
ROME, June. 29.â The debate in the
Chamber of Deputies to-day on the con
flict at Ferrara on June 27. between agri
cultural strikers and soldiers, some of the
former being killed, became so super
heated that the President was obliged .to
suspend the sitting.
Signor Giolitti, the Minister of the In
terior, replj'lng to an interpolation Jin
the subject, said he regretted the Inci
dent, which was due to the introduction
of foreign labor for harvesting. The Gov
ernment advised against foreign labor,
but when the advice was not heeded it
was obliged to safeguard the liberty of
work. The strikers attacked the .troops,
and the latter fired and killed three men
and wounded a score.
Deputy Blssolati asked if It was true
that the officer in command was drunk.
The Minister of War, General Count San
Martino, hotly repudiated the charge, and
a violent exchange of recrimination fol
lowed, ending with the suspension of the
session.
Tranquillity was restored and the session

PARISHIONEKS TO AID
SACRED HEART SCHOOL
Benefit Entertainment to Be Given at
Native Sons' Hall Next Wednes-
day Night.
Arrangements have been completed for
the benefit entertainment to be given by
the parishioners of Sacred Heart for the
Dominican Sisters of Sacred Heart School.
The entertainment is to be given next
Wednesday evening at the Native Sons'
Hall. Â» j
The people of the, parish and the Cath
olics of the city in general have been
greatly surprised and grieved to learn of
the anticipated suspension of the Sacred
Heart School. The pastor, Rev. 1 Father
Lagan, has made no official announce
ment, but the expected departure of the
nuns has confirmed the rumors.
- For many years these good sisters have
worked among the children of this dis
trict and the people are leaving no stone
unturned in their endeavors to retain the
Sisters.
The school building formerly used has
been declared unfit for school purposes
and, the parishioners are anxious to se
cure a rented house in the neighborhood
until such time as they, in conjunction
with Father Lagan, can erect an edifice
that will stand a monument to the parish.
Some of the best local talent has volun
teered its services for the benefit enter
tainment, and there is every indication
that the affair will be successful and that
the people of the parish will be able to
present a worthy sum to the sisters, aid
ing them to take up again the work in
which they have proved so efficient.

considerably delayed her. From 50 de
grees south in the Pacific to port the us
ual weather was encountered.

rible D?ath at Early Hour. â¢
William Wilde, a lineman employed by
the Independent Electric Light Company,
was almost instantly killed early this
morning by an electric shock. The acci
dent occurred near the corner of Taylor
and Ellis streets.
The unfortunate man, with several help
ers,was sent out to repair a break in the
lines operated by the company. A break

the pole and ascertained the extent of tlie
damage. -.-.'. , . .-â¢--. , â¢ . Â¦ ,
Â¦ Climbing to .the^top of the pole he pro
ceeded' to" examine the wires..' Suddenly
he uttered a shriek. His companions
looked upward and were horrified to see
Wilde hanging from a wire by his hands.
His body was jerking about convulsively,
and the uncanny blue flame generated
by v contact ; of flesh with a live electric
wire, was showing' against the darkness
of the niffht.
As quickly as possible a comrade of
Wilde climbed the pole, fastened a rope
about his body and severing the wire
lowered the. unfortunate man to the oth
ers below. â¢ :
Life was extinct when the body reached
the pavement.. The little finger of his
right hand was badly burned show'ng
that one of his gloves must have been
faulty.
At the Morgue a small hole was found
in the little finger of the faulty glove.
Wilde, was 21 years of age, and resided

WASHINGTON, June 29â Comptroller
of the Currency Dawes late to-night ap
pointed a temporary receiver for the City
National Bank or" Buffalo. The follow
ing statement was made by Dawes:
"A recent examination of the City Na
tional Bank of Buffalo made by a special
examiner showed a serious condition of
affairs existing in the bank. In order thai
this report.might.be thoroughly verified
the Comptroller on Friday sent A. D.
Lynch of his ottice, together with another
examiner, to Buffalo to make a careful
re-examination of the condition of the
bank. On Saturday Mr.-Lynch telegraphed
the Comptroller that the- former report
was sustained in all particulars, and
thereupon the Comptroller wired him as
follows:
" 'The condition of this bank is so seri
ous that I cannot consent to Its reopening
for business Monday morning unless suf
ficient assets to pay the depositors in full
are satisfactorily guaranteed. The bank
is certainly insolvent, and I have no right
under these circumstances to permit the
withdrawal of deposits by delaying action.
If the directors think that their efforts
from this time until banking hours Mon
day morning are insutiicient to provide
means to rehabilitate the bank, notify me
and I will appoint a receiver immediate
ly.'
"In accordance with the tenor of this
dispatch arid reports from. Buffalo, the
Comptroller has appointed E. J. Vaughn.
National Bank Examiner, as temporary
receiver of the bank. The failure of the
bank is due to injudicious loans. It is not
thought that the loss to depositors Â¦will be
large."

Howard ' W. Kernaghan and

Missing.
â¢Special Dispatch to The Call. *
SEATTLE. June 29.â An elopement, a
probable, marriage, and no knowledge of
whither the young couple has gone, is
causing grief to the parents of Edith
Morse of Everett and .genuine surp*rlse to
the friends and acquaintances of Howard
Vv\ Kernaghan, erstwhile cashier of the
Sunset Telephone Company of this city.
Miss Morse, scarcely. 20, and pretty, was
until Wednesday afternoon long-distance
telephone operator â¢ at- Everett.-" She had
answered the "hellos" at that place for
many months and not infrequent were the
call-ups from young â¢ Kernaghan when
things were dull of an evening at the local
exchange. Besides the dally talks over the
wire Mr. Kemaerhan made it a Sunday
habit to visit Edith at her home in Ev
erett.. Friendship soon ripened into love,
with the result that Edith left home on
Wednesday afternoon, ostensibly to visty
Snohomish. She has not been seen by her
parents since, neither do they know' where
she .is. iKernaghan was absent from his
desk at the Sunset yesterday ' morning
and no one knows whither he has gone.
At his boarding place on Fourth avenue
it was learned that lie had not occupied
his room last night. Evidently he had.
taken all of his best clothing with him.
as his apartments were in a state of con
fusion and all effects of value had been
removed.
Kernaghan was seen hastening with a
huge grip toward the depot at the foot
of Columbia street yesterday afternoon.
An hour afterward he was seen in com
pany with Miss Morse on the water front.
. Howard W. Kernaghan is the son of
George F. Kernaghan, a banker of Pasa
dena, Cal. He is widely acquainted In
Seattle. Miss Morse is well known in
Everett.
A marriage license was procured of the
Auditor on Thursday. The names given
were Warren H. Kernaghan and D.
Morse, the ages 23 and 20 respectively.'
The young man transposed his first and
second given names, for what purpose is
not known, unless to keep the fact of his
marriage secret.

A CALIFORNIAN VISITS THE MONTEZUMA
MINES.
Concord, Cal., June 27. 1901. â¢
J. 6. C. Thompson. Esq.. General Manager
American Guaranty and Trust Company, San
San Francisco:
Dear Sir â Having just returned from a visit
to the Montezuma Mining Company's proper-
ties near Fairfax. Wash., I desire to say that
I am more than pleased with what I. saw. I
found everything humming at the coal camp,
tawmill g-?ttirur out lumber, carpenters busy
st the flume, miners extending the coal drift,
and everything progressing favorably. After
spending nearly a day examining the coal prop-
osition, and having satisfied myself that If
the Montezuma had no copper at all. It had a
very profitable business in Its Immense seams
of coal, I rode out to the Mowich camp (the
Tarotna mine, but I prerer to call It the Mo-
wich. as being the more distinctive name).
The camp Is in process of r>eing enlarged, a
eecond log house being nearly finished, and
â¢when ready the working force at this mine will.
I understand, be considerably Increased. As It
is. the main tunnel is now in over 200 feet, sev-
eral cross sections have been made, and a sec-
end tunnel started down at the river level.
Every indication points to the fact that the
Monteruma has in this Mowich copper mine
a fund of almoet inexhaustible wealth. You
can see that the mine is a good one, but how
pood it remains to be proved. The rule Is for
copper to be richer and better the deeper you
go. At least I saw enough to convince me that
in Investing in the Montezuma I had gotten
hold of a good thing. I am quite content to
await developments, and am ready whenever
the funds are available to increase my holding
In the company. The shares would be cheap
at par.
I had a most enjoyable trip, â¢was cordially
received by the officers of the company and
was only sorry I could not spare the time to
etay longer tnd see more cf the beautiful State
of Washington. Yours faithfully. Â¦ â¢
GEO. R. WARD.
A PetAluma client Increased his holdings by
4000 shares because a friend of his Is "ac-
quainted with the properties and declares they
are all the company claims for them." Clients
resident in San Francisco and vicinity yester-
day added 39.000 chares to their holdings. The
Montezuma Is the only company that has cop-
per, coal and coke "all under one roof." The
consensus of opinion among Investigators Is
Pt offers the best opportunity for lnveet-
before the people to-day. Address

: renPresident D. E. Collins of the California
Bank haa returned from the Y. M. C. A.
Jubilee Convention In Boston and speaka
with enthusiasm of the great gatheri^s
held to commemorate the fiftieth anniver
sary of the founding of the association
in the United States. Mr. Collins said
that most of the time Mechanics Hall,
where the sessions of the convention were
held, was crowded to its full capacity of
6000 seats.
"It was a magnificent gathering, includ
ing leaders in every department of busi
ness and scientific activity, said Mr. Col
lins. "We received messages from Presi
dent McKlnley, King Edward, Emperor
William and other distinguished person
ages. A dramatic incident was the recep
tion accorded to the cablegram of the
King of England. The delegates arose
and sang "God Save the King." while tha
leader waved the union jack.
"I never knew of so many eminent men
being gathered together in one place be
fore. The addresses were notable efforts
by some of the ablest orators of the coun
try "
Mr. Collins made a study of Eastern
business conditions and visited the Buf
falo exposition. . He said there was a
strong feeling of confidence among finan
ciers, although some uneasiness is felt
over the influence of the new trusts.

It New York Stock Market.
j NEW YORK. June 29.â Professional opera
tions r>layed a large part in to-day's stock mar
ket, but the professional operators bought
stocks Quite freely and bid up prices with con
fidence. The conviction that the money mar
ket -will show progress toward greater ease
next week with the disbursement of funds ac
cumulated for the purpose of paying half-year
ly dividends and interest, was the mainspring
of this confidence. There Â«ae relief also over
the settling up of the affairs of the Stock Ex
change house which closed its doors yesterday.
Although the embarrassment of this house
came as a eurpribe to the general public, its
struggle to secure means to continue has been
known to business connections for some time
end has created dread of the effect of the fail
ure. It ls believed that a considerable part of
ltÂ» credits had been accumulated with the
bank whose suspension was caused thereby.
With the shock of the announcement passed
and the affairs in course of settlement, the at
mosphere is felt to be clearer. The corn car
rying grangers were in conspicuous demand to
day on account of favorable reports regarding
the corn crop. Illinois Central roee S%, St.
Paul >VÂ» and Bock Island 2%. There was a
fair sprinklnlg of gains, reaching a point cr
more, among the Important standard stocks.
The market closed Quiet and etcady at about
tbe tor level.
The influences which ere usually looked to
to repress if not depress epeculation in stocks
during the last week in June have been em
phasized this week by the disturbance of cred
it caused by the failure of the Seventh National
Bank and the Stuck exchange house whoso
operations had involved the bank in its diffi
culties. The financial disturbance in Germany
growing out of the failure of th*Â» Leipzic Bank
hac Irt-t-n a minor influence in the same direc
tion. The result has been some forced liquida
tion by weak speculative holders, which cut
Into prices throughout the list. The liquidation
Â«u not remarkably heavy and prices showed
resiliency, coming back rather easily in the
Intervals. The eelling pressure was partly due
to the fact that the Stock Exchange bou&e in
volved was on the ehort side of tile market and
the cloeJng out of Its accounts Involved the
buyinp-in of stocks. But the usual â¢ conse
quences of a downfall of banking credit, how
ever much the causes were seen to be .local
ized and due to Irregular methods, were not
to' be escaped. The disclosures in connection
with the failure made no showing calculated to

arouse distrust as to the soundness of the
general business situation, but the character of
ihe securities Involved and shown to have fig
ured in that banking business supposed to be
conducted on conservative linos had the inevi
table effect of caufcing a closer scrutiny of col
lateral on. the i>art of all money lenders and
a feeling of suspicion of credits in general.
Much had been said and written since the
stock market panic in- May of the healthful
result of that episode in having checked ex
cessive speculation which Would lead to infla
tion of X'rices and to the flotation of all man
ner of doubtful securities. The very general
recuperation in prices of standard securities
since the May overturn has revived confidence
in 'the intrinsic value of securities. 'Such de
velopments as those of this week, however, in
cite to some contemplative reasoning as to the
after effects likely to" flow from a great epec
ulatije boom like that of this year, in its
residue of securities in which capital was con
fidently invested during the boom period with
the well warranted prospect of a ready sale,
while all was confidence in the indefinite rise
of pricos and speculators were eagerly seek
ing new securities. The number of new secu
rities of a minor class which do not figure at
all in the Stock Exchange dealings and which
are of the class designated as "inactive," has
been multiplied in the last few months. There
have been in consequence much throwing out
of doubtful collateral for loans and calling of
loans for any cause of dissatisfaction, which
aggravated the scarcity of money incident to
the season. Great confidence is professed that
thp market will be benefited by the release of
lanre amounts of money next week by the divi
dend and interest disbursements, but in times
past this relief has proved somewhat tardy on
many cases. Notwithstanding the restrictions
of money supplies and the narrowness of the
speculation. Wall street sentiment is that a*
r-orfidenee in the future. The outlook for a
wh.>.at crop of almost unexampled proportions,
coupled with foreign shortage, is the most Im
portant item in this confidence.
T'le shortage in Germany has been supple
merited by the- growing evidence of large re
quirements by France. It is felt that the growth
of foreign exchange at the gold export point,
while the excess of our merchandise exports
over imports, is at an unprecedented level. The
larg-j production of gold in the United States
has made the world dependent upon us for a
rart of its supply of the precious metal. The
strii ping of foreign markets of American se
curities and the possible, resumption of South
African gold production, in connection with'
the maintenance of our favorable trade bal
ance and the continuance of industrial activ
ity in the United States are liable to result In
the â¢liversion of the gold current to New York
In the autumn. Such a development would be
llkel;' to have a revivifying . influence upon
prices of etocke here.
Bonds were slightly more active than usual
and ihe price movement was irregular.

WASHINGTON, June 29.â To-day's statement
of the Treasury balances shows: Available
rash balance, ?175,0SS,22L; gold, $38,571,338.
Condition of the Treasury.
The Financier eays: The bank statement of
last week reflected in the decrease of Â«10, 474,000 in
loans, the liquidation In this item which was in
progress during the greater part of. the week
and also the elimination from the statement of
about $4,C0O.0O0 of the loans of the closed Sev-.
enth National Bank. The cash was reduced by
$392,700, which amount very closely agrees with
the preliminary estimate of the movement of
money during the week. It should be noted,
however, that the elimination of the Seventh
National's cash, which in the previous week
was reported at $1,335,400, should be considered
as more or less affectir.g the statement. In ex
planation of the loss of cash through Sub-Treas
ury operations, it should be observed that in
addition to the depository receipts over dis
bursementn there was a payment Â¦ into the
Treasury early in the week of about $1,900,000
by the Chicago and Northwestern, which in the
previous' week bought from the Government the
latter's interest in the Uoux City and Pacific
Railway. Detailed returns of the movement of
cash between banks of this pity and of the
interior disclosed some withdrawals which' may
have been caused by apprehension- of trouble
resulting from the Seventh National's failure.
The decrease of $11,462,200 in deposits Includes,
of course, the $5,712,400 reported by the Sev
enth National in the week ending June 22. This
total loss by all banks, however, harmonizes
with the decrease of cash and of loans. It is
noteworthy that ihe circulation of the banks
as shown In the statement was reduced $351,700.
This, however, was due to the omisssion from
the return of the $299,300 circulation of the Sev
enth National as ttell as by the other items of
that bank. The incidents of the weak were of
a more or less disturbing character, but the
outlook on the whole appears favorable. Be
ginning on Monday the heavy disbursements of
dividends, aggregating over $100,000,OCO, will be
inaugurated, and in addition # to this supplies of
gold are already arriving from Alaska. There
will be a great deal of shifting of funds and
this .will be reflected in succeeding bank state
ments.
Surplusâ *8,S44,20O, increase Jl.872,630.

Assessor Dodge yesterday completed the
total assessment roll of the city and
county for the next fiscal year and sub
mitted his report thereon to the Board
of Supervisors. The total assessed valua
tion on which the city's revenue will be
raised amounts to $415,135,184. This in
sures an excess revenue of about $100,0(50,
as the tax budget was based on a valua
tion of 5405,000,000. If the city does not
lose that amount by return of protested
taxes it will have a surplus fund to be
used ffcr various purposes. In his report
the Assessor says:
The assessment roll for the coming year
â¢mount* to $415,195,184. This Insures a revenue
at least $300,000 greater than that which your
board had at its disposal last July.
This additional revenue, together w*th the un
expended surplus of last year, due to a similar
increase in the assessment roll of that year.
Fives a tctal of $568,000, Â¦which Is now available
for needed public improvements, and for liqui
dating tne city's Indebtedness to its creditors,
including Its school teachers and merchants.
While our revenue has thus been increased,
largely through the assessment of newly discov
ered property, there have been large reductions
made in the assessments of certain kinds of
property, as shown in the following table:
Boll Of 1900 $410,155,304
Redaction on old dwellings. $3,700,000
Reduction on outlying- real
â¢estate 2.500,000
Loss on church property.... 1,500,000
Loss on national bank stock 1,700,000
Loss on estates 2,180,000
Total loss ! $11,680,000
Remaining .\ $398,575,304
This loss in the roll was made up by the fol
lowing increase:
Is'ewly discovered property $10,125,000
Increase in real estate 4.500,000
Other additions 1,994,880
Total roll 1901. .......$415,195,184
The reductions made in the assessed valuation
of dwellings and of suburban real estate have
afforded relief to 20,000 taxpayers, and aggre
gate $6,200,000. Notwithstanding these reduc
tions, the additions made to the roll during the
past two years have added 'at least $600,000 to
the yearly revenue of the city. An examination
of the roll will show that real estate is assess
ed this year for J192, 000.000. while in 1898. prior
to these additions, it was assessed for $189,000,
000. This increased revenue then is almost en
tirely due to an increase of $55,000,000 in the
assessed valuation of newly discovered personal
property, all cf which has been in the posses
sion of these individuals and Â¦ corporations, who
had not heretofore contributed their just share
In taxes, but who are now willingly bearing
their proportionate burden.
In 1897-98 out of every $100 in taxes collected.
real estate contributed $S1. while to-day It
pays only $69 out of each $100 collected. To
this extent, then, has the real estate owner
been benefited by the Increased assessment of
personal property.
The collections made by this office on unse
cured personal property during the past ninety
days amount to $623,521, which Is now in the
hands of the Treasurer, subject to Immediate
use. and which amount greatly exceeds that
eollected by this office during any previous
year.
While the roll of this year exceeds the sum
on which your board based the city's revenue
by $10,000,000. it Is not unnecessarily large, as
the amount of last year's roll standing delin
quent to-day, including the national bank stock,
Is $9,500,000.

The Board of Supervisors and the Board
of Fire Commissioners are again adver
tising for bids to supply the city with
forage for year ensuing. The fact was
made known by The Call that the dealers
were preparing to , make .' the city pay
exhorbitant prices, 'as was evidenced by,
bids that were opened some -time -ago.'
Upon the presentation of the fact by The
Call that the bids were far too high, the
Supervisors, and the Fire Commissioners
threw ~ out all . bids with one * exception-
The Fire . Commissioners - have . awarded
the bid for oats. Under : existing'condi
tions there is every reason suppose
that the" city will get a much- fairer/ deal
when the new forage bids axe opened than
it had under the old* bids. ~The * bid for
supplying oats that the Fire Commission
ers have -,; accepted . was made ' by " Simon
Erlanger, and was' for Jl 38%: per 100
pounds for No. 1- white oats. .'Â¦â¢ This is , far
beyond the actual- worth, of Â¦'- the- oats..
Some way may yet be found to have 'the
oat bid rejected. * The"; price of ; oats â¢; has
been steadily falling. The crops of. oats,,
barley and hay . are exceptionally, large
this year. One month ago red oats; were
bringing 51 40 to $1 45 on 'change: . Now
they can be bought for $1 02 per 100 pounds
and the price may. yet go down to 90 cents.;
Dealers- who are not: in ' the combine ; to
supply the city say ".that. the:, bid before
the . Fire Commissioners . for . oats'-, was
higher/proportionately, than were the bids
for; the various grades Â¦ of ; hay^ required
