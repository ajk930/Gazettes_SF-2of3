MEMBERS DEVOTE MUCH TIME
TO TOPICS OF IMPORTANCE

lively sessions, at which reports were received from tzvo
of the.- leading committees, who submitted matters for

TO JOHANNES BOTHA
British Authorities Decide That the
Young Fighter Should Not Be
Executed.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 22.â The sentence of
.death recently imposed upon Johannes
< Botha has been commuted to imprison
ment for life. Commandant Scheeper has
been added to the list of those sentenced
to riermanent banishment from South Af
rica.
\u25a0 PUEBLO. Colo., Oct. 22.â A special
courier to the Star Journal brings news
of wild excitement over a gold discov
ery at Beulah, thirty-eight miles west <.f
this city. Five hundred claims have been
located in the past twenty-four hours. A
ledge of free milling gold returns nearly
$2000 a ton. Pueblo people are rushing to
the place.
Wild Excitement in Gold Fields.
The Times, confirming the report that
General Buller preferred dismissal to
resignation, expresses astonishment at
his "amazing defects of judgment and
sense of military discipline," and says it
hopes the change is the beginning of an
era of real army reform.
The Daily Chronicle and the Daily News
attack the Government for weakness and
lack of courage in ever appointing. Gen
eral- Buller to the command of an army
corps.
LONDON. Oct. 22.â The War Office an
nounces that after a consideration of all
the circumstances of General Buller'a
speech of October 10 and the explanations
thereof furnished by General Buller, ho
has been relieved of his command and
placed on half pay. The King has op
proved the appointment of General
French to succeed Buller as commander
of the First Army Corps, the appointment
to become effective when French's ser
vices are no longer required in South -Af
rica. Pending his return, General Hild
yard will assume command.
General' Buller's supercesslon was not
unexpected, but the manner of it has
caused a sensation. It is understood that
the Government endeavored to break the
fall by giving him the option of resigning,
but that Buller declined to give way. The
morning papers all express sympathy for
the unfortunate ending of a brilliant
career, but they are unanimous that no
other course was open after his indiscreet
speech,* and they express the greatest ap
proval of the selection of General French
to succeed him.
Indiscreet Speech of the General the
Immediate Cause of His
Dismissal.
BTJLLER HAS LEFT
THE ARMY OF BRITAIN
There are some facts that have not been
mentioned ' previously that illustrate the
peculiarities of an episode that probably
has never been paralleled in mining his
tory. It has [been published in The Call
that after the convention of the" miners
was adjourned Monday the special .com
mittee went: to the office of the Debris
Commission and there held a protracted
conference. At the end of the talk W. C.
Ralston emerged from the Flood .build
ing, tightly gripping in his ' stout : right
hand a sack which "contained $2500 in shin-
Ing gold pieces. He turned down Market
street and went to the hotel where
O'Brien was supposed to be. O'Brien, by
the way; after his appearance at the min
ers' convention . that day, the first day of
the proceedings, went directly away, but
having had time to hear that the conven
tion proposed to. collect the money and to
offer it to him' and so force an issue. -
Ralston did not find O'Brien at the ho
tel. The committee did not mean to be
balked by trifles and at once began to use
the . wires to Smartsville, where ! O'Brien
lives, to find out where he: was stopping
and they learned. at a late hour Monday
night that he was supposed to ; be at ; the
home of a daughter who : lives : on Myrtle
street In Oakland. ..: Notwithstanding : the
Ralston added that it; had been ascer
tained that the failure to make the tender
to O'Brien personally would not 'do any
harm.. The committee had : visited the
office of the United .. States Attorney and
had there: been advised that O'Brien's
own act in notifying/the Debris Commis
sion that he withdrew his option had ob
viated - any. difficulty ' occasioned by the
failure, to find him. When O'Brien so no
tified the commission he practically sahi
he -would decline to accept the
money in pursuance of thecarrylng out
of the option. The money had been raised
and was ready for O'Brien before the ex
piration of the option.- The United States
had already taken cognizance of O'Brlen'a
attitude ' by . bringing . suit in the' United
States Circuit' Court;to compel; him to
make the option good. , This information
pleased the convention.- With the state
ment the consideration of '\u25a0 the : O'Brien
matter before the convention was. closed

to the Farallones, whereat the members
of the convention laughed.
The text of the committee report, Is as
fellows:
Resolved, By the California State Miners' As-'
eoclatlon, that we mourn in William McKinley
the type of American citizen that we all honor;
Dsplore President's Death..
"All In favor of the adoption of these
resolutions," said President Voorhies,
"will please rise."
The scene was â¢ impressive. The entire
hall had been patriotically decorated
with the national colors. From galleries
depended gay festoons of bunting, and
the shields of the several counties of the
State gleamed at Intervals along the dra
peries, above which rose small American
flags. Picks and shovels told of the na
ture of the convention. Gay bannerets
of blue, with golden fringes, defined the
location of the numerous delegations
from the mining counties. Amid the ar
ray of bannerets and under the masses
of bunting and the insignia of their
craft the miners rose to their feet. Here
and there the light colored gowns of
ladles made a patch of color in relief.
Only the day before the Nestor of the
convention, J. H. Neff, had repeated to
the convention the famous . message that
Abraham Lincoln told Schuyler Colfax to
bring to the coast. "Tell the miners of
California" â so ran the wordsâ "that the
country owes a debt of gratitude to
them." With that message still fresh in
mind the California miners paid respect
to the memory of McKinley.
"The resolutions," said President Voor
hles, not without a show of emotion, "are
unanimously adopted." <
yesterday at the convention of
the California Miners' Association and
stood silently a moment in testimony, of
their respect to the memory of William
McKinley, late President of the United
States. A special committee had been
appointed to draft suitable resolutions.
President Voorhles, presiding over the
deliberations of the convention, an
nounced that the committee was ready
to report. Professor Christy of the min
ing department of the University* of Cali
fornia, took the center of the stage and
read, solemnly and slowly, the resolu
tions in which the ' death of the nation's
chief was deplored.
MEN representing all the mining
counties in California, from
SIskiyou to San Diego, rose to
their feet in Golden Gate Hall
One of the delegates facetiously sug
gested that O'Brien. had gone for a trip
The entire second day of the miners'
convention was crowded with matters of
concern to the mining industry. 'There
were addresses and reports, the latter be
ing filled with facts. The interests of
the petroleum miners received attention.
Once more the matter of O'Brien's option
on lands for the restraining basin of the
Yuba River Works came up.
When the convention adjourned for the
day O'Brien had not been found. The
special committee appointed to locate
him and make proffer of the $2500 in cash
that was raised on the preceding day re
ported through the chairman, W. C. Ral
ston, that although efforts had been made
to place O'Brien failure had so far been
the result. As the option was dated bn
October 22, 1900, and yesterday .was the
22d, marking the full expiration of the
time for the payment of the money, Ral
ston reported also that the committee
were of the opinion that they would, not
be able to make the tender personally to'
O'Brien. ,
O'Brien Still Missing.
Resolved, That, recognizing in loyal â¢ citizen
ship* the strongest safeguard against anarchy,
we call upon every American to do his whole
duty aa a citizen, to create and maintain a
quickened public sentiment which shall not only
aid in the enactment of wise and Just laws,
but shall compel them to be respected and en
forced. WÂ« most especially urge our courts
to aid In such swift and certain admlnstratlon
of Justice as shall command the respect and
confidence of the people; be it further
Resolved, That we urge upon Congress to
pass such Immigration laws as while enabling
all honorable and worthy foreigners to become
citizens shall vigorously exclude from our coun
try all who, are unwilling to abide by Its
laws. '
Resolved, That we wish to express with the
entire civilized world our abhorrence of govern
ment by assassination as foreign to the spirit
of our civilization, and as the mortal foe oC all
that makes for patriotism or progress; be. it
further '
the brave Eoldier, the tender and devoted hus
band, the generous and loyal friend, the public
spirited citizen, the wise statesman. His broad
sympathies with every section of our great
country, his long and useful public life, his
tragic end, his generous kindness and sublime
faith in the face of death have made us forget
differences of parties and creeds, and we stand
by his grave united In our common loss; be it
further
One of the most important pieces of work for
this convention will be to take all due care that
in the . remaining legislation to be passed by
Congress . upon this subject there shall be no
deviation by a hair's breadth from the original
purpose of this scheme of legislation, or from
the understanding under which this scheme of
legislation has had the approval of the Cali
fornia-State Miners' Association. For what
ever purpose, or upon whatever foundation In
timations have been fluttering In the air, of late
that there might be an attempt made' In the
coming session of Congress, j in the bill appro
priating the remaining $150, 000, to incorporate
some proviso or clause which would nullify the
A very interesting report was sub
mitted to the convention by the commit
tee on legislation through the chairman
of the committee, John F. Davis of Ama
dor County. The committee maintained
the doctrine championed by it at two pre
ceding conventions of the miners that fu
ture legislation with reference to the law
of mining in almost . all its branches
should *be amendatory of existing Federal
law rather than "independent statutory
amendment at the hands of the Legisla
ture. - - Generally speaking, so .. the com
mittee reported, there was nothing in the
geology of California which required min
ing legislation of such a peculiar .nature
that it could be obtained only from.* the
State Legislature, 1 , The following resolu
tion was recommended for passage by the
convention:
Resolved. That wo heartily favor the amend
ments to sections 2319, 2320, 2324, of the Revised
Statutes of the- United States, \ concerning the
location of mining claims, bo that the locator
shall be accorded a reasonable time within
which to finally mark his surface boundaries
on tha ground; so that all local rules, regula
tions and customs of miners and all State and
territorial law on \ the location of mining
claims shall be abolished; and so that, whllo
liberal provision 'shall be made for the protec
tion of the locator who holds and works . his
claim In good faith, the law concerning annual
assessment work shall most effectually check
the present Injurious practice of holding claims
year after year without practical development.
\u25a0 The committee also reported concerning
the work of securing additional legisla
tion and appropriations for the aid of the
Yuba River restraining barriers. The
Legislature had appropriated ! $150,000,
one-half of the remaining $300,000 that was
asked for. . It remained for Congress to
appropriate $150,000, the State having com
pleted its share of the work as suggested
in the recommendation of the California
Debris Commission. The committee re
ported: â¢
Report on Legislation.
lateness of the hour, there was a member
of the Debris Commission at a hotel on
Montgomery street who then had the coin
for O'Brien in charge. As soon as the
news came from Smartsville there was a
stir in the Palace Hotel, where the min
ers were holding committee meetings.
There was then a wild rush to' catch a
boat for Oakland, but this mission failed
of results, as- O'Brien was- not found.
Yesterday there was more searching, but
the advice of. the United States Attorney
made it appear that It was of less impor
tance than it had at first appeared wheth
er O'Brien was located or not.
For the purpose of any miner who desires to
take his chances under the act the test of the
constitutional question should be made in some
case brought against a company or person oper
ating under a duly obtained permit from the
commission, and not In any case against a
company or person not operating under' such a
permit. Not only Is that true, but the test
would have to be made In a case where a
farmer attacks the constitutionality of the act
on the ground that some constitutional right of
his. Is being abridged' by the. miner, working
under the permit of the commission, or by the
State of California contending that some of
its constitutional rights are being abridged by
the act of a miner operating under 'a duly ob-"
talned permit from the commission. No other
test will be of any avail; no obiter dictum of
any court In considering the act from any other
point of view or in any other controversy, other
than either of the two above set forth, will. at
The committee recommended as follows
concerning the case to be brought to test
the act:
Such action, continued the committee, on the
part of the Anti-Debris Association, challenges
the constitutionality of the act and discloses
their purpose of getting the miner to submit
to that Jurisdiction without submitting to it
themselves. The question of the constitutional
ity of the act. as a protection to the miner,
has never been passed upon.
The committee reported that the min
ers who have availed themselves of the
terms of the act have complied with the
onerous terms imposed and have in every
such instance gone before .the commis
sion. The Anti-Debris Association, on
the other hand, when they have â¢ com
plained of mines working Injuriously un
der permit, do not go before the same tri
bunal to ask for a revocation or modifi
cation of the permit, as they can do at
any time, but have of late been going Into
the Superior courts of California, asking
for injunctions.
The Red Dog: hydraulic mine has already
been closed down by injunction from the Su
perior. Court of Sutter County; the Polar Star
mine Is closed down under a temporary re
straining order from the same court, and suits
have been begun or are . threatened against
many other mines operating under the Juris
diction of the commission.
The committee also paid attention to
the law on the statute book for the pro
tection of minority stockholders In min
ing corporations. This law was discussed
at length. The committee found it to be
cumbersome and of no further use; there
fore its repeal was urged. Oil corpora
tions complained that the law hampered
their free" action. The instructions of the
preceding convention to the committee
were to have the constitutionality of the
California Debris Commission act tested.
The committee reviewed -. that act at
length, going back to the North Bloom
field decision.
Dehris Act Discussed.
good faith upon which all previous appropria
tions have received our support, and It will be
necessary, therefore, for thl3 association by
the means of a committee, or In some other
practical way, to see to it that in the bill
passed by the coming Congress there shall be
no rider and no variation of the phraseology,
or'of the terms In which 'the appropriation is
made. ' \u25a0

San Jose Young Man Knocks Down
His Bloodthirsty Father
in-Law. Â»
SAN JOSE. Oct. 22.â The wielding of a
rolling pin in the hands of his brawny
6on-in-law prevented Frank .Williams
killing his wife and daughter at his home
on Race street last night. As it was, the
would-be murderer was rendered uncon
scious and before he recovered his senses
he had been locked in jail and charged
with assault to commit murder.
With Williams and his wife have lived
their daughter and her husband, Frank
Hines. For some time the two couples
have not got aiong very well. On Sun
day Williams chased his wife with a large
knife. Last night he pursued her with
an aoc. declaring- he would kill her. His
daughter and Hines came to the rescue,
and Hines struck Wiiliams down with a
rolling pin before he could do any
damage.
After his arrest Williams said the only
reason he did not kill the "whole outfit"
was because he had no pistol. He at
tributes all the trouble to his son-in-law.
Williams is an engineer and about 50
years of age.

REDDING, Oct. 22.â Because he was of

man Beshaw of Quartz Hill is in a pre

his sufferings. The youngster asked the
head of a neighboring family how steam
wa3 made." The man, who was a miner,
entered into .an explanation, and, to ad-
Just it to the boy's mind, told Herman
that if he placed a* coal oil can full of
water over a lire and allowed no oppor
tunity for the steam to escape it would
burst the can. At the same time ho
warned the youngster against trying the
experiment.
Mr. and Mrs. Beshaw paid a visit, to
Keswlck yesterday. Their boy and a
young son of Mr. and Mrs. John Kemble,
a neighboring family, proceeded to try
the steam experiment. Herman Beshaw
procured a syrup can, filled it with water,
corked it up tightly and placed it over a
fire. they. built on the ground. The ex
pected explosion occurred, but earlier than
the youngsters expected. Steam and hot
water struck Herman on the face, chest
and arms, scalding him frightfully. The
other !ad escaped with slight scalds on
the face. â¢\u25a0 Little Herman's recovery is

There were -few men better --known in

about 76 years of age. ;
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Oct. 22.â The death
of Judge ' George Steele, which occurred
at his home this morning, was a shock to
the community. He was a member of
the well-known family of that name,
many members of which have been prom
inent in the State's history.
Judge Steele's death was occasioned by
blood poisoning, which he contracted from
a sick horse. He was in San Luis Obispo
on Wednesday last and was seemingly
as hale and hearty as possible for a man
of his years. Shortly after he returned
home he remarked that he did not feel
well. On Friday a physician was sum
moned, but the Judge gradually sank.

DAWSON, Oct. 3, via Seattle, Oct. 22.â
Four birdes-to-be, one from San Fran
cisco, who arrived from the outside on
the steamer Yukoner, coming in to be
married here, had a romantic conclusion
to their engagements. It happened that
the steamer had brought several small
pox patients down the river a trip or two
before that on which the brides came.
The health officers did not learn the fact
until this later trip, when the, Yukoner
was about to land in Dawson with the
brides and her other passengers.
The vessel was, unexpectedly to those
on board, boarded here and fumigated,
and all the passengers not having vacci
nation certificates or being unable to
make affidavit that they "had been vacci
nated within the last seven years were
required to submit to the operation on
the vessel. Two of the intending brides
had to bare their arms with the others
The trouble did not end here. The bag
gage of the young ladies ,was seized for
fumigation, and three who would not de
lay their wedding even a day had the
ceremony enacted in their ordinary gar
ments, while the trousseaus were treated
with sulphur. The steamer got in at sun
set and before midnight three of the
couples were wedded. The ceremony
uniting the fourth took place three days
later.

BAKERSFIELD, Oct. 22.â So far as the
laying of the rails and ties is concerned
the Sunset Railroad, from Gosford to the
town of Sunset, is completed. However,
many days will elapse before the trains
will be run on regular trips, as the work
of leveling and filling in is yet to be done.
The schedule for the trains has not as yet
been arranged, but President C. N. Beal
said that an extra train probably would
be run over the line until the traffic war
rants the operating ' of passenger and
freight trains separately. -
The completion of the road has done
away -with the uncertainty in which the
Sunset district has been enveloped, and
it is said that extensive development
work will soon be commenced by new oil
companies and operations resumed by
those already in the field. Oil men who
have made a study of the situation assert
that the Sunset district ,is in the future
to be prominent in the oil industry of
California.

UKIAH, Oct. 22.â William H. Lowe,
the alleged kidnaper of little
Harold C. Sloper, is still in jail
here, no bail having been.sup
plied. There appears to be quite
a difference in the stories/ told- by Lowe
and Mrs. Sloper, Sheriff Grace and others.
Mrs. Sloper says her baby .was in his
buggy, with ..her and her friends, when
Lowe first approached. He wanted to
shake. hands with the child, who was eat
ing some popcorn.. Then ,he asked for
some of the popcorn, and after the young
ster had given him some Lowe walked
away. Soon .he; returned and finding the
baby out of the buggy picked him up and
walked off down the platform. Returning
he passed the mother, the child in his
arms and then disappeared in the crowd.
About that time the train began to move
and Mrs. Slower learned, that the .man
had taken her child aboard.
It is claimed that Lowe had no reason
to believe the child's mother was on the
train, as he had just passed her on the
outskirts of the crowd and ne?r the buggy
beside which he had picked u1> the child.
Passengers, on â¢ the train deny that he
tried to find the parents, as he avows,
but say he placed the boy beside him in a
car and fed him on candy when he grew
restless. . Lowe could have gone .through

Engineering Laboratory
to Be Constructed

Fifty Thousand Dollars Will

Special Dispatch to The Call.
UNIVERSITY, Oct. 22.â
As was expected, -Mrs. Stanford's arrival
at the university \u25a0 has stimulated action
here along the line of the construction of
buildings. Before she had been in the
campus twenty-four hours she had au
thorized the immediate construction and
equipment of an engineering laboratory at
a cost of $50,000. â¢
The new laboratory is to be a large one
story fireproof structure, 235x60 feet in
dimensions, and probably will : be located
just west of the present civil engineering
building, on' the site originally intended
for the chemistry department. The west
erly, half of the new edifice is to house the
steam engineering- laboratory of the me
chanical engineering department, while
the quarters for the experimental work of
the . electrical engineering v *gtudents will
occupy the remainder. v
As soon -as the present civil engineering
building can' be vacated it will be remod
eled into a perfectly equipped laboratory
for the testing of materials, and the me
chanical engineering quarters will under
go a similar change, being converted into
a machine shop flted with all the modern
improvements. Recitation and draught
ing rooms for engineering students will
be installed on the Inner quadrangle as
soon as, those now occupied by the chem
istry end some ether departments are va
cated, buildings being now under can
struction for these latter departments.
Architect Charles E. Hodges is draw
ing up plans for the engineering labora
tory and ground will be broken prepara
tory to- its construction as soon as they
are submitted and approved. It is Mrs.
Stanford's intention to have work on the
structure rushed. The building will be
completed within four or five months and
will be equipped and "ready for use as a
laboratory with the beginning af the col
lege year next September. Orders will be
placed for the necessary equipments im
mediately. The sum of $50,000 does not
represent . the total amount that' will be
expended on the laboratory; more will be
spent as soon as it is placed in a condi
tion to justify the expenditure.
It is also learned that work will soon
be started on the buildings and arcades
that are to complete the second or outer
quadrangle. Mrs. Stanford intends that
the view of the memorial church shall be
obstructed as little as possible; accord
ingly, there will be no buildings directly
back of the church. That part of the
quadrangle will be composed of arcades
which will overlook the beautiful gardens
and grounds that will flank the edifice on
three sides. Work on the church itself
will be. hurried.-

that the convention sat and passed reso

Committee Allege Fraud.
The committee made the following sen
;ral .statements, in Which fraud is
iverred:
The niatter has now arrived at Buch a stage
that it is perfectly evldfcnt tha tthe mineral
lands on railroad grants are earnestly desired
ay the railroad companies, as being- more val
jablc than the- agricultural. The Government
:harges more for them on its own territory and
:he railroad follows suit. - If- these i mineral
ands were segregated thej? would be open to
iny man citizen or one 'who has declared his
r.tention to become one." "We haye been.majt
ng a fair and open fight against injustice and
lk-gal action of the corporations .for the sole
>enefit of the miner and prospector of Califor
lia and in behalf of his natural heritage, the
nineral bearing 'tracts held in trust for. him
jy the United States Government. That much
>; thif land has been alreffOy, alienated is un
lortunately true; and unless this association
jontinues its active contest to have the re
nainir.K lands , clasplflod and segregated, hun
ireds of thousands of acres more will. fall into
.he hands of those for whom neither the Gov-

he last session of Congress. The influ

)f the measure was Chairman Lacey i of
he House Committee on Public Lands.
all settle the question which the hydraulic
miner in California desires to have settled. It
is simpJy throwing sand in people's eyes to pick
out any expression of any court in favor of the
constitutionality of the act,- -which does not
arise out of either of the two states of facts
above set forth. . The miner ought to be just
as anxious as the farmer to ascertain whether
he is moving in a fool's paradise or on solid
earth. The friends and sponsors of the act
should be the first to desire the question of its
constitutionality finally determined. Any other
Donrse means rashness or nervousness.
The committee on mineral lands also
reported through Charles G. Yale, its
:hairrr.an. . The substance of the report
was that after seven years of work for
t.he mineral lands bill, the expenditure of
nany thousands of \u25a0\u25a0 dollars, many com
nitteÂ£ meetings, hundreds of pages of
resolutions and expensive trips to Wash
ngton by attorneys, the miners are, j so
far as Congressional action is concerned,
iust where they began, and at the com
ng session of Congress must relntroduce
:heir bill. The railroad people were
Dlamcd for the situation, and the com
aiittee reported:
To put it more plainly, perhaps. It may be
asserted that if the California Miners' Associa
tion had the money, to' buy out the Southern
Pacific Company, this long pending and pet
measure of ours could be enacted into: law
in about thirty seconds. , ~ ,.."Â» \u25a0
Thanks were recommended to Senators
Perkins and Bard and Congressman. Sam
Dr. C. T. Deane, secretary of the Cali
fornia Petroleum Miners' Association,
submitted a report showing the present
importance to the State of the petroleum
industry. He estimated the total output
of the oil wells of California for the pres
ent year at 8,000,000 barrels. -, He. said that
the Petroleum Miners'- Association pro
posed to see that the smoke ordinance
that has been passed bv the Supervisors
of San Francisco shall be carried out. The
consumption of fuel oil. would be increas
ed by that ordinance." A conservative esti
mate of the requirements of crude oil
aro*nd the bay, apart from that needed
for the refineries/ he said, was more than
2,000,000 barrels per annum. A combina
tion, of interests would remove the cause
that has clogged the way to financial suc
cess for. the petroleum miners. .
State Mineralogist Aubury \ described
the work- of the State - Mining Bureau
and. told of the practical lines along
which it is proceeding for the -promotion
of the mining industry of tbJs State. The
convention \ indorsed = the
of the bureau by Mineralogist Aubury, a
resolution for that purpose having been
introduced by J. H. Tibbits of Shasta
County.:
There was some speech-making, the
speakers being Samuel M.Shortridge and
United States Senator George C. Perkins
The proceedings of :->the day -went
smoothly with ;the exception of a Blight
flurry when the adoption of the report of
the committee on legislation was moved.
There were other , reports. Secretary
Benjamin and Treasurer S. J. Hendy re
ported on the financial and other condi
tions, of the association. ' From these it
appeared that ' the membership had been
largely increased in the past year. New
organizations ..were formed In Mariposa,
Madeta, Kern and Lassen counties and a
large organization of the miners of
Northern California was about to come
into existence. The treasurer showed
that there were funds, on hand, to the
credit of the California Miners' Associa
tion amounting to $2983 74.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W.. WASHINGTON, Oct. 22.â
In order to deal a death blow to
the insurrection- throughout the
Philippine archipelago, an active
'campaign, participated . in â¢" by the army
and navy, has been inaugurated against
the rebels in Samar. That island is to
be swept clean of Filipinos hostile to
American sovereignty. They are to be \
given no opportunity to escape to another
island. They will be killed in action, or
in order to prevent being driven into the
sea they must surrender.
Comparatively meager is the informa
tion in possession of the, authorities re
garding the tmrposes of Major. General
Chaffee. Some light was thrown upon
them by the following dispatch received
by the Navy Department from Rear Ad
miral Frederic Rodcers:
CAV1TE, Oct. 22.â Secretary Navy, Wash-
I' ington: Active insurrection in Samar. New
York leaves to-day for Catbalcgan with 300
marines, to return to Bazy and Balangigan,
Lto co-ocerate with army. Nearly all naval
r force concentrated on Samar patrol. Services
I Arethusa and Zaliru, two colliers, needed and
beine utilized. , RODGERS. t
I* This dispatch shows, Secretary Long be-
Ilieves, most gratifying co-operation be
tween Rear Admiral Rodgers and General
Chaffee. It is apparent that the two offi
cers have held a conference at which they
have determined upon a vigorous cam
paign. The authorities have not been in
formed by names of the men of war pa
trolling the island of Samar, but they be
lieve that there are about twenty-seven
distributed in its waters. These include
the armored cruiser New York, the gun
boats Annapolis, Don Juan de Austria,
Frolic, General Alava. Isla. de Cuba, Isla
de Luzon, Manila, Princeton, Vicksburg,
Piscataqua, Wompatuck. Arayat, Basco,
Gardoqui, Leyte, Mariveles, Panay.Pam
panga, Paragua, Quiros, Urdaneta, Vil
lalobos, Arethusa. Zafiro. Justin and Iris.
These vessels are under the supreme di
rection of Rear Admiral Rodgers, and be
sides aiding the army in attacking coast
and river towns which may be held by the
insurgents, will prevent the escape of any
in small boats to neighboring islands. The
effect of the patrol that will be maintained
will be to pen the hostile natives in Sa
mar, and they must either suffer death
or throw themselves upon the mercy of
the American troops.
The direction of military operations has
been entrusted to Brigadier General
Hughes. The force under this officer ap
proximates 3500 men and with the marines
will number 3S00 men. General Chaffee is
expected to order reinforcements to pro
ceed to Samar.
Wheatcn May Take Command.
It Is possible that he may send an offi
cer to assume the supreme command of
operations in Samar, thus enabling Gen
eral Hughes to devote his energies to
actual field work. In this event a major
general, perhaps General Lloyd Wheaton,
will be ordered to the island. Some ap
prehension exists at the War Department
as to whether General Hughes properly
estimates the strength of the insurrec
tlonaries In Samar. The War .Depart
ment Is hopeful that with the force now
ak General Chaffee' s disposal he will be
able to suppress the insurrection; if not
General Chaffee must provide him with
additional troops. in Luzon who
are decidedly hostile to American sover
eignty, are greatly encouraged by the

AUBURN, N. Y., Oct. 22.â Leon F. Czol
gosz, the assassin of President McKinley,
who is awaiting electrocution in the pris
on here during the week commencing
next \u25a0 Monday, , fully realizing that his
death is now a question of. a few days,
has. asked for spiritual consolation, and
this afternoon received a visit f rom the
Rev. T. Szardinski, a Polish priest of the
Roman Catholic church.'
Czolgosz's request for a priest of . his
own nationality was made known - to
Warden Meade this morning. Father
Szardinski, who is pastor of St. Stanislaus
Church, Rochester, was in this. city at
tending the forty hours' devotion of St.
Alphonsus Church, and was asked to visit
the prisoner. This afternoon he went to
the prison and remained there about an
hour. -r
The interview between priest and' pris
oner proved very unsatisfactory : to both.
It took place in the condemned man's cell
and. the conversation was carried on In
Polish. During the interview CzolgosZ
said that he had been baptized in the
Roman Catholic faith ~ in the Polish
church In Detroit. . He had abandoned
the church early in life and had lost all
faith in its teachings. Father Szardinski
urged him to renounce his belief in an
archism and return to the faith of ; his
early years. Czolgosz declared his in
ability to'do so. and he was informed that
unless he did the consolation of th3
church would be denied him.
The priest urged the condemned man to
consider the matter carefully, and told
him that if at any time he decided to re
embrace the faith he would return from
his home in Rochester and stay with him
until the end. Father Szardinski before
taking his departure left with Czolsosz
some Catholic literature printed in Polish
and also some emblems of the church.
Czolgosz assured Father Szardinski that
in case he determined to accept the of
fices of religion he would send for h'ro,
but he did not hold out much hope that he
would renounce the doctrines of an
archism, â ,

Sir Thomas Already Takes Steps
. Toward Another Contest for
the Cup.
GLASGOW, Oct. 22.â Sir Thomas Lipton.
while desiring to avoid monopolizing the
British side of the -America's cup con
tests, has already taken a step toward a
third contest for the trophy. Captain Rob
ert Wringe, who returned here from New
York on the Anchor line steamer City
of Rome yesterday, went to Fairlle and
held a conference with "W. W. Fife Jr.,
as to whether he would undertake de
signing the Shamrock III for a series of
races in 1902. It is understood that Fife
was opposed to rushing out a challenger
for 1902. He considered the time too
short to do his best work, but was will
ing to design a challenger to race. in the
autumn of 1903. No absolute arrange
ments can be made until Sir Thomas Lip
ton arrives, but there is little doubt that
a challenger will be sent.
Acting on Fife's suggestion, Captain
Wringe went to Gareloch to provide for
the better preservation of the Shamrock
I, which will be used in the trials on this
side of the water, the Shamrock II to ba
employed in the trials on the American
side' of the Atlantic.
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â Sir Thomas Lip
ton sailed for home to-day on the
steamer Celtic. His steam yacht, the
Erin, will sail to-morrow.
"And Captain Sigsbee took that dispatch?"
"Xez. sir. It was cpen. It detailed the fact
that the fleet was net there."
Continuing, the witness said that by the
time the Brocklyn had completed her
turn (and he thought the turn had been
continuously to the nght). the three lead-
Ing Spanish ships had emerged from the
harbor. The witness thought they had
come out in fan-shape order. "The com
modore," he said at this point, "stood all
the time on the side of fire so he could
eee what was going on. He was abso
lutely cool, end sent continuous messages
to the men to cheer them up. When Ellis'
head was shot oft he wiped some of the
tilood from his own person, and when the
men picked the bedy up to throw it over,
"While the rest of us stood horrified, he
calmly said: 'Don't throw that body over.
Take it below and we'll give it a Chris
tian burial.' V
The court adjourned until to-morrow.
Eispatch. Sigsbcs Took.
"Captain Sigsbee knew I was a newspaper
irian and was there looking for information and
Captain Sigsbee later took a dispatch written
by me and vised by Commodore Schley. He
t'Xik it aboard his s=hip and he was to deliver
i: to one of the erninl beats or else take Â«t
over himself."
' Graham was then questioned particu
larly concerning the conversation between
Commodore Schley and Captain Sigsbee
en the 'occasion of the captain's visit to
the .tsrooklyr. on May 26, as follows:
"Did you 'see Captain Sigsbee on board the
trocklyn en May Â£6?"
"Yes. sir. After he had reached the quar
terdeck frcm the gangway he stopped and
Commodore Schley said to him: "Have we got
'<;m, Sigsbee?" The captain said: 'So, they arc
r.ot here.* I have been here for a week and
they art not here.' "
\u25a0"Is that the Trliole of the conversation as you
recollect?"
"So, sir. "iVe went aft, farther back on the
quarterdeck, and he continued the conversa
tion. Commodore Schley said: "Are you sure
they are net in there?" He sr.ld: 'I have been
Viry close to the harbcr entrance two or three
time-s. Cajitfein Cottcn iÂ»as been in and cut a
cable and ihey are not there.' "
"You heard Sigs-bee saj* that?"
"Ytg. Â£jr. 1 Look some )<jii in the convcr-
BC.tion."
" Did you record that conversation and did
Captain S'Psbes knov.- you rtioided it?"
Graham detailed a conversation between
\u25a0Commodore Schley and Captain Robley
J3X Evans which took place after the San
*tiagx> engagement. Tnere was some dis
cussion over the admissibility of this
\u25a0 statement, but the court decided that any
\u25a0conversation between the commodore and
any one else Rearing upon the case was
\u25a0admissible.
The witnesses for the afternoon were
iJer.nis J. Cronin, who was Admiral
'Schley's orderly, and who also testified
'along* the same lines as Graham to the
\u25a0conversation with Captain Sigsbee; Lieu
tenant Commander William R. Rush, who
f aid he thought the Viscaya had planned
to ram the Brooklyn; Lieutenant Â£dwafd
Simpson, who gave a very graphic pic
ture of the battle of July 3, and Lieuten
ant Edward T. Fitzgerald, an assistant
engineer, who was on duty in the tire
room on July 3, and who testified that an
order had been given early in the action
to stand by for a ram.
The Conversation With Evajis.
Graham's testimony covered all the
principal events of the campaign and dis
euased especially the bombardment of the
Spanish ship Colon on May 31, and tt:e
battle off Santiago on July 3. Graham tes
tified to hearing a conversation between
: <Z Dmmodore i Schley and Captain Sigsbee
when the latter came; aboard, the flagship
Brooklyn off Santiago, May 23. He said
\he had distinctly heard Captain Sigsbee
tell the commodore that the Spanish fleet
"was nfct inside the harbor of Santiago.
Graham also stated that Admiral
Â£chley had told him that the object of the
bombardment on May 31 was to develop
the Spanish land batteries, and he said
'that the range was fixed at 7000- or <o00
yards in order to draw their fire. He fur
ther said, with reference to the events of
this ergagement, that he had heard no
â¢conversation in which Commodore Schley
â¢liad said that the officers in their white
'Uniforms were conspicuous objects.
"WASHINGTON. Oct. 22.â The Schley
\u25a0court of inquiry opened to-day with Lieu
teaiant B." W. Weils Jr., who wus Commo
dore Schlcy's flag lieutenant during the
Spanish war. still on the stand, but he
â¢was soon displaced to allow Yeoman Al
twrt V. Mason, who had written the
Brooklyn's log for the period covering the
Santiago campaign, to testify.
Mason explained the erasures in the log
Â«ntry referring: to the Brooklyn's turn on
ihe day of the battle off Santiago. He
â¢was followed by George E. Graham, who
a;> correspondent was with Commodore
Schley during the enure campaign.

that it is probable they, will resume active
operations if American troops are t with
drawn or reduced to a point where they
can be attacked with some 'show, of vic
tory. These considerations, will be put
before Secretary-Root in connection with
a recommendation that reinforcements be
sent, from the United States to the Phil
ippines. It .Is proposed to order several
regiments to Manila to replace those who
will be withdrawn on account of the ex
piration of terms of enlistments of: many
of the enlisted* men. While General
Hughes has not communicated to the
"War Department, his plan of campaign," it
is expected that it contemplates a divi
sion of the island into squares, in each of
\u25a0which a strong detachment will operate.
By this 'means the whole island, will be
rid o'f insurgents and it will 'be impossible
for any to escape. .; â¢ ./
The island of Samar is a dense jungle,
and it is extremely difficult to operate
with success in such a country. If Gen
eral . Hughes pursues his planr; however,
the authorities , are satisfied that it will
not be long before the rebellion in Samar
is crushed and the insurrection through-

Baldness follows falling hair, falling

result of a germ digging its way into the
scalp to the root of the hair, whefe It saps
the vitality of the hair. , To destroy., that
germ is to prevent as well as cure dan-
druff, falling hair/ and, lastly, baldness.
There Is only one preparation known to

1 Qan FrancJsco. |no_textno_textno_textno_textIt will be recalled that up to the time of the pri
maries it was believed the Republicans had something
like an easy walkover in this contest The Demo
cratic party was divided and almost demoralized. A
straight-out Republican convention could have nomi
nated a ticket which would have had a victory that
would hardly have been disputed. That prospect,
however, was blighted by the convention when it-sur
rendered to the bosses and accepted a ticket made up
fcr it by two railroad Democrats who never in their
lives cared anything about the Republican party or
about San Francisco, and whose only aim in helping
the Republican bosses was to put themselves in a"
position where they cculd demand a return of favors
in the shape of service rendered to the corporations
by which Burke and Herrin are employed.
Stanch and loyal Republicans will not accept can
didates named by corporation Democrats. Under any
circumstances such nominations would be revolting
to the party. In this instance there are many cir
cumstances attending the nominations that make
them even more revolting than they would otherwise
be. In the first place the manner in which the nomi
nations were Kiade was insulting to the intelligence
and independence of the rank and- file of tne party,
and in the second place it seems the bosses deem this
to be a yellow dog year, for most of the candidates
on the ticket for Supervisors are of that variety.
There is but one way for honest Republicans to
effectively resent and remedy the wrong that has been
put upon the party, and that is by defeating the can
didates whom Herrin and Burke have nominated. It
happens that the men named by the Democratic party
for Supervisors are men whom the stanchest of Re
publicans can vote for without any sacrifice of party
loyaity or any lack of civic patriotism. They have been
tried in office and they have been found to be faith
ful and honest. No scandal stains the record of their
service. In an election of this kind, where no party
principle nor even a partisan policy is at stake, Re
publicans can well afford to vote for the candidates
for Supervisors who can be expected to render the
most faithful service to the city. One set of candi
dates comes before the people with an open record of
work done for the city, the other with a secret pledge
of work to be done for corporations. No intelligent
man, Republican or independent, can hesitate how to
vote on si:ch an issue . .
STANCH and stalwart Republicans who are
proud of the traditions of the party and who are
loyal to its principles watched with no little dis
gust the proceedings of the so-called Republican
convention in this city which nominated candidates
for Supervisors dictated by such well-known Demo
cratic bosses of the Southern Pacific Railroad as W.
F. Herrin and Jcre Burke. It may. be admitted that
some of the candidates nominated are. good men, but
why was it necessary for them to have the indorse
ment of Burke and Herrin?
It is a safe proposition that politics is never
employed for the accomplishment of straight ends.
Burke and Herrin were not called into Republican
councils for nothing, neither did they intrude them
selves into those councils for nothing. It must have
been an arrangement ior muiual profit between the
Republican bosses of the convention and the Demo
cratic bosses of the railroad that brought their agree
ment upon the ticket for Supervisors.
It hardly requires any probing into the secret meet
ings of the bosses before the convention to demon
strate the existence of a conspiracy among them to
use the Republican party as a means of getting con
trol of the city government and making use of it for
the advantage of corporations. Where Herrin and
Burke are working in the sunshine we may be sure
that corporations. are lurking in the shadow. It is
therefore a foregone conclusion that these men nomi
nated at the dictation of the Democratic corporation
bosses were pledged to give the corporations what
soever they wish.
THE CHOICE OF SUPERVISORS.
Senator- Mason's recent" statement that the fight
against him amounts to nothing and that he is;sure
of/re-election may be cited- as another evidence that

A sea captain who recently arrived at. Philadelphia
reports having sailed for miles \u25a0 through "a blood
colored-sea which' was' swarming with snakes." The
log shows no statement as* to the kind of grog used
during the voyage.
It is announced that Sarah Grand, author of "The

formation that her name is Mrs. McFall; she is of

WOODWARD'S RULES-O. - C, City.
You "have informed as to
the rules of the late R. B. Woodward, he
whp founded Woodward's Gardens, as to
the conduct of the What Cheer House,
which he opened in this city In 1852. First,
'he gave no man credit for room, or board.
If a party came to ;Mr. Woodward and
told him that he was broke and wanted
a meal or a bed on credit he would refuse
him, but would call him to' one side and
give him, if he appeared to be a deserv
ing person, 50 cents and tell him to go
somewhere else for a meal or a bed, as
the' case .may.;be.- .The second- rule was
that no liquors . should â¢ be sold on the
premises, and the third was the , rule
which prohibited the entrance of women
in- the .What' Cheer- under any- circum
stances. '.- No man, however high his sta
tion, could get a room there for his wife.
The rule was extended^ to apply to. all
employes, and during th'e time he was in
charge there never was "a" female employe
or servant in the premises.' " .
A Pennsylvania gentleman is boasting of having a
fruit, tree which bears two kinds of apples and four
kinds of pears, but even that record does not equal
Quay's famous plum tree, from which he could shake
down at any time any kind of plum for any number
of men who voted right. â¢ â¢
The Republican State campaign committee of
Maryland has purchased 14,000 pairs of spectacles, so
that nearsighted persons may see clearly to vote the

LETTER OF INQUIRYâ Subscriber,
City. A letter of inquiry addressed to The
Call's department of Answers to Corre
spondents asking for an answer through
the columns of the paper does not have
to have a stamp inclosed, but letters of
inquiry of a personal nature or those ask
ing for answers which if printed 'would
amount to an advertisement of any busi
ness or firm should be accompanied by a
self-addressed and stamped envelope. The
same rule applies to a letter of Inquiry
sent to any one outside of a. newspaper
that has a department of answers to cor
respondents. It is enough to ask the par
ty addressed to furnish the information
desired, without asking him to* pay post
age for the privilege, of answering.
SUPERVISOR REED'S new ordinance intended
to abate the nuisance of freak advertising on
the public streets appears to be well devised to
meet and overcome the objections made to the former
ordinance on the subject. The issue is one that has
engaged the attention of municipal authorities not
only in all parts of the United States, but in Europe
as well. That form of advertising has, in fact, be
come one of the serious nuisances of civilization, and
it is everywhere evident that some means must be de
vised for putting an end to it.
While restrictive ordinances have been adopted in
many cities, it is notable .that at present in the East
ern States the trend of public sentiment on the sub
ject is in the direction of regulating the nuisance by
means of. taxation. That system was adopted some
years ago in France, and as a result the French Gov
ernment enjoys the satisfaction of deriving a hand
some revenue from, billboard advertising, as well as
the satisfaction of jjerceiving that the worst features
of the nuisance have been abated.
In discussing this phase of the subject the Boston
Herald recently said: "Advertising genius has had
its ruthless, impudent way too. long, 'making its work
a nuisance to; the life of communities. There are laws
now forbidding some kinds of signs, but they are not
well enforced, chiefly because it is not made any one's
business to enforce them. But if all posters were sub
ject to taxation, an immense number would promptly
cease to afflict, and all that would hereafter appear
would conform to such rules and regulations as the
law might impose. The regulations might apply to
FREAK ADVERTISING-.
. Chairman Jones of the Democratic State Commit
tee of South Carolina recently withdrew from the
race for the seat in the Senate now held by McLaurin,
and in doing so recommended that the party unite on
Wade Hampton for the succession. The affair has
created something of a sensation in the State and
should the plan be carried out there will be surprise
in the country, for a combination of Wade Hampton
and Tillman would be a startling novelty even in
politics.
PUBLIC UTILITIES â T. E. McG.,
Eureka, Cal. The following named pirtces
in the State of California own their own

Palo Alto.
A story is going the rounds of Europe to the effect
that the Czar of Russia, as a means of promoting the
peace of Europe, has suggested to France and Ger
many the advisability of making Alsace and Lorraine
an independent country to form a "buffer state" be
tween the two nations; and there the story ends. It
appears the man who invented it did not feel capable
of telling what-the Kaiser said when the proposition
was made to him.
LICENSESâ K., Kirkwood, Cal. If you
desire to go into the business of travel
ing .through the country and selling from
house to house spectacles and eyeglarses
and propose to deliver the glasses to those
who need them after an examination of
their sight, you will become a peddler and
will have to have a peddler's license in
whichever county you' may do business.
If you canvass for books to be delivered
by the house you represent, you will not
need a license.
SUNDAY CONTRACTSâ A. M. T. Con
tracts made on Sunday are popularly
supposed to .be void. This is a matter
largely dependent on local statutory law.
In the absence of a statutory inhibition
parties may make a valid contract on
Sunday as well as on any other day. Even
when enactments exist such contracts are
not usually void, but only voidable, and
if subsequently, ratified on a secular day
they may be enforceable according to the
terms.
MOVER OF A MOTION-P. D. R., City.
It is customary for the president of an
assemblage to appoint the mover of a
motion to name a committee as chairman
of such committee, but it is not obliga
tory. That the president of the assembly
'does not appoint, the mover on the com
mittee or as chairman thereof is not to be
taken as evidence that the president is
ignorant of parliamentary law.
HOSPITALSâ Inquirer, Haywards, Cal.
To prevent one county from saddling the
destitute sick of its territory upon the
free hospital of another county each
county in the State of California, has
placed a time limit as to residence before
a patient can be admitted for treatment.
This does not, however, apply to emer
gency cases.
OZOCERITEâ Subscriber, City. Ozocer
ite, also written ozokerite, is a mineral
"wax of a rich brown color with a green
tint, found in immense deposits in Galicia
and Moldavia. It is one of the mineral
resins occurring in shales of the coal
formation, and is refined and molded into
candles.
ST. LOUIS BRIDGE-J. K., City. The
great Eades bridge across the Mississippi
at St. Louis was, according to Switzer's
"History of, Missouri," the Missouri State

The smart, clean, well dressed boy gazed
longingly at the gutter urchins, with their
damp bundles of newspapers and matches.
This activity and independence had an un
speakable charm for him, and after a se

It so happened that the telephone girls

Tire United States owes much to the Yale teaching
and the Yale influence. It is now recognized that the
founder of the institution was one of the truest of the
benefactors of the country. His memory merits every
honor that will be given it. More and more we are
coming to recognize that the welfare of our republic
is dependent less upon its political constitution than
upon its educational system. The best form of gov
ernment cannot avail to advance an ignorant or a cor
rupt people. It is therefore to the centers of light
and learning that we look for the inculcation of the
principles and precepts that are to keep us as a free
people and a great nation.
In his address the other day President Hadley said:
"It is becoming evident that the real test of an educa
tional system lies in its training of a citizen to meet
political exigencies. If it accomplishvthat result it is
fundamentally good whatever else it may leave un
done. If it fail in that -cardinal point no amount of
excellence in other directions can save it from con
demnation."
That is the kind of doctrine taught at Yale, and it
is sound doctrine. It is quite true that. all students
at Yale are not attentive to the teaching, but most of
them are, and the people as a whole are in full sym
pathy with the Yale festival because they know that
she has taught her sons that to be rightly trained for
citizenship the youth must be as President Hadley
has said: "Inflamed with the study of learning and
the admiration of virtue, stirred up with high hopes
of living to be brave men and worthy patriots."
On the day when the university extended her formal

President Eliot of Harvard, for the universities of the
Eastern States; President Dabney of the University
of Tennessee, for the universities of the Southern
States, and President Harper of Chicago, for the uni
versities of the West. It will be perceived Yale has
not yet learned that Chicago is 'not the West of this
country; that, in fact, it is some distance east of the
center; but that error, we trust, will not long con
tinue. In the absence of any genuine Western repre
sentative we are just as well satisfied to be repre
sented by President Harper as by any other Eastern

Look at this list of these products mined and pro
duced in commercial quantities in California alone.
We produced for the season of 1899-1900 antimony,

chrome, brick clay, potters clay, coal, copper, fullers

products of our soil in field and garden crops and
fruits and timber, aÂ«d of our waters in fish. But Na
ture has not been content to endow us with these
alone, and has stored in the soil and in the embrace
of the rocks an equally amazing variety of metals and
minerals.
It is a goodly, land, and that part of its interests rep
resented by this Miners' Convention is in good hands.
genius of our people is trained and brought to bear
upon these problems of reduction, and we learn how
to wrest the value of our metals from close-fisted Na
ture, the metallurgical center of the world, which is
now at Swansea, Wales, will be transferred to this
coast, and will rise somewhere upon the shores of
San Francisco Bay.
The Miners' Convention has before it practical is
sues of immediate importance, but it should have a
forward look toward these other issues which affect
the permanence of mining and the location of its
greatest and most complete expression here.
" There is no doubt that all of these interests would
get a great impulse' if the industry could secure repre
sentation in the Cabinet. This is the greatest mining
country in the world. Our iron, coal, copper, oil,
stone, gold, silver, salt, borax and soda make up the
greatest group of precious and economic metals and
IN no other State in the Union is there as general
interest in mining as in California. Here was the
great production of gold in the United States.
We were ahead of Australia in the discovery and de
velopment of large deposits, and our fame as a gold
producer went fo*th into the world ahead of Siberia.
Nearly all of the improved processes of mining have
originated in California, or have been the discovery
or invention of California miners.' Our other indus
tries are great and permanent, but there is scarcely
an enterprising man who does not turn to the mines
as a last resort to make or recruit his fortune. Nearly
every prominent public man has had something to
do with mines. Our senior Senator, Perkins, was a
sailor, a merchant, and is now a large ship-owner,
but still he is a miner. The great fortunes made in
this State. have been won in the mines, or in their-be
ginning related to that industry. Even the four build
ers of the Central Pacific Railway had to trace the
foundation of their wealth to the building of a line
originally intended to reach the mines of Dutch Flat.
- It is no wonder that the State Mining Association,
which is now holding its tenth annual convention in
this city, has a membership of nine thousand, the
largest, we believe, of any industrial organization in
the Union, and perhaps in the world, in proportion
to the population .it represents. It has done much
for mining, but much remains to be done. California
should no longer permit the State of Colorado to
have the leading School of Mines ii\ this country.
Her institution at Golden is overflowing with students
of mining from all over the world. California . has
furnished the greatest mining experts and engineers
known to that industry. They have developed the
mines \u25a0 of Africa and are developing those of
China. They are consulted by the Russian officers in
Siberia. \u25a0 Naturally the State from which they hail
should have a great mining school, in which the en
gineering, , metallurgy, mineralogy and' geology of
the subject should be taught to all comers. This
State should permit it no longer to appear that Wash
ington University in St. Louis and Johns Hopkins in
Baltimore have to furnish the mining chemists who
master the reduction of the refractory copper ores of
Arizona and the rebellious ores of Oregon. California
has excelled all others in the mechanical appliances
of mining, and in the engineering of mines. But
mining now requires the union of chemical with me
chanical skill and knowledge, and this State should
go forward to that branch of the subject in the knowl
edge that rich rewards await the experts who' can
solve some of the great chemical problems presented
by the large variety of our ores and by the combina
tions in which the precious metals are found.
Between this State and a great iron mining industry
lies a barrier that mechanics and chemists must com
bine to solve, and when a smelter rises in that solution
we will export iron instead of importing it. If the

The problem is a troublesome one, and the nuisance
increases rather than diminishes. In some way a
remedy must be provided, and up to this time no plan
for abating the nuisance has proven more successful
or has been more generally commended than that of
subjecting it to the regulations of tax laws.
place as well as to size and character. Taxation
need not, as some fear it would, authorize offensive
signs. Certainly they would have no more freedom
and encouragement than they now have, and it would
be practicable to abolish them altogether."
That statement may be taken as a fair expression
of the conclusion of the Eastern press upon the sub
ject. It has been stated in almost the same language
again and again by the leading papers in New York,
Philadelphia and Chicago. In fact, the French plan
of imposing a tax upon such advertising has been
tried and found to be. effective, while no other form
of regulation has been effective. As the Herald has
said, "there are laws now forbidding some kind of
signs, but they are not well enforced chiefly because
it is not made any one's business to enforce them."
We have an illustration of that neglect' in our own
city in the fact that the Supervisors have found it
necessary to refer to the 'Police Committee a resolu-.
tion directing the attention of the police to J;he ordi
nance prohibiting the maintenance of inflammable
fences more than ten feet in height. That ordinance,
it appears, has not been enforced,, and the Chief of
Police has been called upon now to enforce it.

Up to the present publishers have very

but there are many signs that he is to be
extensively for- in future.
The ordinary booksellers seem aboutvto

stores of America has damaged the trade
of the old fashioned booksellers.

Some people s.re wondering if the
American system of selling books is being
introduced into this country.
Hall Caine's 100,000 was the biggest send
off a novel ever had. g I believe at least
75,000 copies of these have already been
sold.
The "Life of Tolstoi," by Dr. E. J. Dil
lon, is to be published by Messrs. Hoflder
& Stoughton, while Messrs. Sands will
send out "Gabriel Rossetti," W. M. Ros
setti'B translation of his father's versified
autobiography.
Fiction reigns supreme as ever so far
as quantity is concerned.
One or two records have been estab
lished in. the matter of first editions.
Graham Balfour's "Life of Robert Louis
Stevei:son," in two volumes, is to copae
from Messrs. Methuen. "Jane Austen,"
by Constance Hill, a guinea book, with il
lustrations, will be published by John
Lane, and an essay on "Walt Whitman,
with a selection from his writings by Ed
mund Holmes, is also promised by the
same house.
The list is especially strong in literary
biographies, including Andrew Lang's
"Alfred Tennyson," which Messrs. Black
wood have nearfy ready in their "Modern
English Writers" series.
The publishers' programme, if it prom
ises nothing of surpassing importance, is
of average interest as a whole, and it
sometimes happens, as In the case of "An
Englishwoman's Love Letters," the suc
cess of the season lurks in a book which
has passed unnoticed in the announce
ments. That is the way of the book trade.
Biography and autobiography again
take the lion's share in the leading an
nouncements.
With the autumn publishing announce
ments out It is easy to anticipate a busy
season. The \u25a0 difficult thing is to Eay
whether it will be a prosperous one or
not. Booksellers, from what I can gather,
seem rather more sanguine than they
were a year ago. They point to the fact
that the theaters have begun well. This Is
a good sign, they say, and they
add that the book trade has improved con
siderably since the beginning of Septem
ber.

Joseph S. Tobin* spoke at three meet
ings last night. The courtesy of a crowd
ed hall was extended to him in every case
and his frank declarations for things hon
est and clean won for. the candidate for
the Mayoralty the respect and enthusi
astic approval of all his auditors.
He spoke first at Murphy's Hall, Ocean
View, where he found a bonfire and the
whole community ready to greet him.
"I came here to talk to you," he said,
"not as an aspirant for office but as a
young man seeking the same ends for
which you are striving. I mean the bet-'
terment of San Francisco. We are seek
ing an honest government, not a govern
ment subordinated to boss and corpora
tion rule. My object in 1 political life is to
improve the government of this city. I
am not trying to garner votes for the
future. I want no other office. I have
no object -beyond what I consider rthe
duty I owe the city I love so well. If I
fÂ»m elected Mayor of this municipality the
doors of my office will be open to the rail
road magnate and to the humblest citi
zen. I want you to feel that my fight is
your fight and to give me the same sup
port-you would if I occupied the cottage
adjoining yours or spent my days plowing
furrow for furrow with you in the field."
Tobin's reception at Progress Hall, 3766
Twenty-fourth street, was, if anything,
more enthusiastic than at Ocean View.
"I was nominated at the eleventh hour,"
he said,'"and I have made pledges to no
body, g I accepted the nomination feeling
it was my duty as a young man. I have
no ax to grind. If elected I, shall use
the office , for. the single purpose of fur

in life is to scrape the bones of the body

a story which was published in the Bul

happened tending to establish cordial re

The Tobin managers fully appreciate
the advantage to their candidate of giv

from the Toâ¢n headquarters last night

Many of the candidates fancy that it
would be a good thing for them if Wells

conceded by the leading politicians of all
parties that the Supervisors nominated
by the Democratic convention will be

ly fear that. the bosses who dictated the
Republican nominations are behind a
scheme to loot the city. It Is.amte well
known that Wells is suspicious of the Re

The candidates who are under suspicion

and if common gossip can be accepted
many of them are quite willing that their
friends should vote for Tobin.
Kainey Is for Wells.
The story that Sam Rainey has deserted
the Republican boss combination and
gone over to play in Schmitz's orchestra
is not correct. Rainey is for Wells and
the whole list of Supervisors presented to
the convention by the allied bosses.
Tobin is likely to secure a large vote
from the Republican Primary League. A.
Ruef however, is supporting Schmitz.
Rainey in the hope of curing this defec
tion promises Ruef the future leadership
of the Republican party in the north end
of town. It is known to all the politicians
that the bosses gave out orders to ignore
the Primary League in every matter con
nected with the organization of the con
vention, although the league ticket se
cured S500 Republican votes, which was
really a majority of the Republican vote
cast at the primary election. Democrats,
rounded up by Rainey and Graney,
turned the scale against the league, but
there will be another election November
5 and the bosses are beginning to fear
that the league voteis going to Tobin.

him draw up a will, leaving every dollar

ter, and In the event of her death every
thing reverted to him. When she died
the daughter took possession of the prop
ertv, and by the shrewdest kind of in
ves'tments doubled its value. It was her
plan to buy a lot in the business portion
of the- city '.nd then borrow money
enough to erect a substantial building on
it. She would then devote all her time
to securing tenants and- mortgage the
property, receiving her profit from
rentals. . .
A year ago she created a sensation by
having General W. H. L. Barnes draw
up a deed by which she gave all her prop
erty to Mr. Lloyd. The latter was loath
to accept the munificent gift and in or
der that the donor could have the use of
the property during her lifetime Mr.
Lloyd gave her an irrevocable power of
attorney. She made the deed so that her
relatives could not secure a dollar from
her estate after her death. It was even
stipulated In the deed of gift that in the
event of Mr. Lloyd's death the property
would go to his heirs. .
Miss Isabella Levy succumbed to in

him all her property, which she was to
hold until her cemise. By her death Mr.
Lloyd's fortune, will be increased to the
extent of $30,000.
The story of her peculiar action is an
interesting one. Mr. Lloyd had been her
friend and counselor for a score of years.
He had watched her develop from a
young girl to si shrewd business woman.
He had counseled sending her to Mills

STATEMENT BY ASA R. 1A/ELLS
Extract from San Francisco Bulletin, October 3, _^1OO1. Six
o'clock edition:
There is trouble in the Republican cainp. ' Auditor Wells, ,the
nominee for Mayor, has shown his' dissatisfaction and delivered
tfce' hottest ultimatum to the campaign managers of his party
that has been heard in political circles for many a day.
When Mr. AVells learned yesterday morning that Flint had
been left out in the cold he vowed that he would have something
to say before the day Was over. In the evening? he went to his
rooms in thc'Fleasanton and after dinner sent for Max Goldberg.
Max canxe quickly, and after discussing: the various phases of the
situation Mr. Wells rose from his chair and began pacing the
floor. Then he started:
"Mr. Goldberg, you are aware that I asked that Sir. Flint be
nominated for Supervisor on that ticket?"
"I am well aware of it," said Max, "but I couldn't help the
action of the convention."
/ "Then I want to tell yon now that unless a place Is made on
the ticket for Mr. Flint I sliall withdraw from the contest. I care
not whom you may drop, but I insist that some one shall be drop
ped. Flint goes on or I go off."
To say that Goldberg was stunned would be putting: it mild
ly. He reached for thephone and called up Herrln. The latter
told him to come tu his house at once. Goldberg left the Auditor,
jumped into a hack and started for the Herrin home. What hap
pened there is not known, but this morning a conference was
held at the Auditor's offfice at which Tom Itiordan and Max Gold
berg were present.
"Xow," said Mr. Wells, "before Saturday that ticket must be
changed. I don't care whom ypu decide to let out, but unless way
is made for Mr. Flint â at onceâ I shall withdraw for good."
Shortly afterward Auditor Wells made this statement to a. .
reporter of the Bulletin: "I -wish it understood that I am" not
finding fault with asrf gentleman who has been named on the
ticket. I believe, however, that, as the head of the ticuet, I have
some rights, and tlTcss i-igrhts I am determined to - preserve. â¢ * â¢ * ,
The leaders of the party agree -with the 'position I have taken,
and Mr. Herrin has so expressed himself. I don't know yet
whether the change will be made, but if It is not I shall certainly
retire not only from the contest, but from politics for all time
to come." Â»
Horace Davis was called upon by Presi
dent Newhall to speak on "Flour." Mr.
Davis traced briefly the growth of trade
in flour with Asiatic ports and spoke of
its enormous increase in the , v last ten
years, within which period the leading
millers of California have all established
permanent agencies in the Orient. He
said that if no duty were placed on flour
by the new tariff regulations, within ten
or twelve years the exportation of flour
to China would take all the surplus of
the wheat production of the State, leav
ing growers and grain merchants largely
Independent of the Liverpool market. The
farmers would, he asserted, reap much of
the benefit.
Isador Jacobs spoke for the fruit can
ning industry. He said that all the mar
kets of Europe, except that of England,
were closed by high tariffs against Cali
fornia canned goods. In the opening up
of Oriental trade California saw a ray of
hope, and If the Commissioner were suc
cessful in protecting the interests of that
industry there ought to be a vast in
crease in exportation of that class of mer
chandise. -
Hugh Craig spoke briefly for the lum
ber and shipping interests. He said all

were adopted. Members spent an hour in
conversation with the guest upon details
of trade with China. â
The reception followed a luncheon given
to Judge Sharretts at the Merchants' Club
by George A. Newhall. There were pres
ent at the luncheon: F. S. Sharretts,

After concluding my labors on the commis
sion of the Chinese tariff to a specific basis I
have been notified by.the President and State
Department that I will probably be called
upon in conjunction with Minister Conger to
negotiate a new commercial treaty with China,
rn this connection I would be glad to receive
suggestions In the near future from merchants
in the United States regarding such changes
as in their opinion will prove beneficial.
In conclusion I wish to say that President
Roosevelt in a recent conversation I had with
him spoke of my mission to China as one of
momentous importance, especially as respect
ing the States west of the Rocky Mountains,
and he expressed an earnest desire that I
would faithfully protect your interests, and T
promise you, gentlemen, that I will carry out
his wishes and demand for you every privilege
enjoyed by citizens of other nations. I am
proud to stand in your midst to-day and have
you speed me on my way with words of friend
ship and esteem. I will feel far prouder when
I have finished my task to have ydu claBp me
by the hand and say, "Well done, good and
faithful servant, welcome home." Gentlemen,
I thank you for your courtesy.
Trade "With. China Discussed.
New Commercial Treaty.
Flour is entitled to free entry into China
under the terms of the protocol signed by the
allied powers and flour will be- on the free
list of the revised Chinese tariff when I have
concluded my labors. Canned fruits and jel
lies I am informed are the next most'import
ant articles exported from the Pacific Coast.
To the shippers I ask that you prepare and
forward to me at Shanghai the home value
per can of every description of this class of
merchandise, and I will then be in a position
to advocate a tariff thereon advantageous to
you, and I trust acceptable to the other pow
ers. To prospective exporters of every line of
American products I urge similar expeditious
action.
Freight rates based upon our geographical
position must be demanded and secured and
active agents to advertise and push your
wares be located in China. Adopt the same
business principles there that you have in
augurated at home, and the day is not far dis
tant when your exports to the Orient will be
enormous.
Whatever differences of opinion may exist
regarding territorial expansion, there can be
but one opinion that expansion of trade is es
sential to our future prosperity. To-day the
United States stands amone the nations of
the earth as a comsetitor for the trade and
commerce of the world and with an open door
and equal richts in China the products of our
mills and factories can and will be marketed
side by side with those of all Europe, and I
am empowered by the President to demand for
the merchants of our country the same rights
accorded to tradesmen of other nations, but
let me warn you, gentlemen, that however
successful my mission may be it must be sup
plemented by diligent efforts on your part to
secure and hold the trade opened to you by
diplomacy.
Trade Expansion Is Essential.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Cham
ber of Commerce: When your distinguished
president and a delegation ot your leilow mem-
Ders requested me last evening to address to
you a lew. words to-day I consented lor the
purpose of explaining briefly the object of my
mission to China ana soliciting from you such
suggestions as would best assist me in pro
moting your interests.
This gathering: ot prominent residents of
your beautilul city warns me that my remarks
devoted to business details like an array of
figures will, I fear, prove dry and uninterest
ing to many of you. in extenuation i piead an
earnest desire to acquire inrormation which
will aid me in adding to your commercial
prosperity. This is my rtrst visit to San Fran-
Cisco and your hospitable greeting will insure
an abiding and pleasant recollection cf the
metropolis of the Far West. Chosen by Mr.
McKlnley before he was stricken down by the
assassin's bullet to represent the United States
as its commissioner to revise the Chinese tariff,
1 feel honored that President Roosevelt con
firmed that choice and called on me to fill
such an important post, but the responsibility
of the position outv/eighg all teelinKS of per
sonal Dride and makes me wish that a more
competent person had been selected to promote
the interests of our country in the Orient.
Unsolicited the honor came to me and I could
but obey the order of our chief executive with
the firm determination .to surrender none of
the rights to which our nation Is Justly en
titled.
The Chamber of Commerce gave a re
ception yesterday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock to the lion. T. S. Sharretts, the
recently appointed United States Com
missioner to China, who will sa'l this
morning for the Orient to look afier the
interests of the United States in the re
vision of the tariff, laws of China. The
most prominent merchants of San Fran

HEART DISEASE.
Some Facts Regarding the Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart troubles, at least among the
Americans, are certainly increasing, and
while~this may be largely due to the ex-
cUement and worry of American business
lite.- it is more often the result of weak
stomachs, of poor digestion.
Keal organic disease is incurable, but
not one case In a hundred of heart trouble
is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nerves,
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way, also the h^art is af-
fected by, the form of poor digestion,
which causes gas and fermentation from
half digested food. There is a feeling of
oppression and heaviness in the chest
caused by pressure of the distended
stomach on the heart and lungs, interfer-
ing with their action, hence arises pal-
pitation and short breath.
Poor' digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment , for heart
trouble is to improve the digestion and to
insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use
after meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be found
at most drug stores, and which contain
valuable, harmless digestive elements in
a pleasant, convenient form.
It Is safe to say that the regular, per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at meal time will cure any form of
stomach trouble except cancer of the
stomach. â¢ >, â \u25a0 .' . , . ,.

COFFEE DID IT.
â¢ETauld Have Been Fatal if Kept Up.
"Coffee!! Oh, how I did want it after
thts nervous strain of public work.
Something warm to brace me up was
all the breakfast I craved, but every
time I drank it I suffered the dying
sensation that follows it with heart flut-
tering and throbbing of the throat and
ears.
"I had no strencth to throw away In
that way, so decided that hot water must
do for me.
â¢One morning I cams to breakfast In
th<5 homo of eome friends In Pueblo,
Colo., Just in time to Bee the mother
pouring some rich, deep yellow coffee
into mugs for the two little boys. One
UttSe chap, had thrust his fingers in the
mug and was Mcklng them with such ap-
proving smacks. This opened the way
for me to say, 'Are you not afraid of the
effects of coffee on the litUe folks?'
The mother explained that it was Postum
Fciod Coffee made at Battle Creek,
Mich., and remarked. 'We think there
is nothing like It.' Then she explained
hew the new coffee had weaned them
away from the use of the old-fashioned
coffee and tea because 'it is so whole-
some.' I drank it there for the first time
and was delighted, not only with the de-
licious flavor, but the after satisfaction it
gives. One day I was speaking with our
family physician's wife about Postum,
when her daughter remarked, 'Yes,
mamma, we are out of Postum, â¢ and I
hi.ve used coffee for the last two morn-
ings and it always brings the tired feel-
ln.ff and troubles my stomach and bowels,
bit Postum makes mefeel all right.'
"In one home they served Postum In
such a way that it was tasteless. I have
found that Postum boiled sometimes five
m:.nutes, and r ometlmes ten, is nothing
more than spoiled water, but when it is
made with two heaping teaspoonsful for
each cup and boiled fifteen or twenty
minutes it becomes a tried a^d proven

REAL ESTATE CITY KOIt SALE.
WILL YOU MAKE SOME MONEY IN THIS?
A big new laundry Is coming to town, and
it's going to make some money. The com-
pany has decided to make it even bigger than
originally intended. To speedily effect the
proposed enlargement the company, at first
a close corporation, has decided to sell a
small block of its stock by popular subscrip-
tion. It is the bargain of the day in in-
dustrial lines, and is being subscribed for by
our clients in all sections of the State in re-
ply to an advance circular mailed to them
a few days ngo. It has been subscribed in
amounts running from $5 to $800. Dividends
will, so shareholders believe, equal the
amount of the investment In about three
years. Call or write for circulars, or better
yet, talk the matter over with us. You may
like it well enough to buy, while we recognize
your privilege to "turn it down." Subscrip-
tion books . are open at our office. THE

PAYING QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS.
Thousands of readers of these advertisements
have cause to regret their apathy as regards
Ehares cf the Monteruma Mining Company of
Washington when they were offered a few
months ago at 4c and 5c. The price of shares
is now I5e cash or CSc on installments, yet are
only one-quarter the price they '\u25a0will be in less
than a year; for Montezuma shares are cer-
tainly going to par value of $1 per share. The
reason for it is obvious. While no copper ore
has been marketed, many tons of it are being
piled up on the dump at the "Tacoma" mine,
\u25a0wher* a second er.try is being driven. Active
work in tunneling was suspended for two
months while the machinery for operating the
air drills was being installed. That work is
competed and a largely increased operating
force is now busily engaged in taking out ore.-
Before this ore can be marketed It Is necessary
to btlld an electric line of about 18 miles to
conntrct the mines with the Northern Pacific
ns.!lt.-ay. which has just been completed from
Fairfax to the new town of Montezuma, where
a pottorflee has been established.
DIVIDENDS PAID FROM COAL.
While work at the copper mines is, as stated,
being vigorously prosecuted, operations at the
coal mines are even more active. More than
ICO men are at work at the mines and In the
building of a 50,000 ton bunker-st Montezuma.
The roal taken out is of a superior quality for
Fteanlng ard cckir.g, while the product of our
creat blacksmithing vein, varying from 6 to 8
feet in width, is being eold on the Tacoma and
Prattle markets at $10 per ton. Monteruma
shareholders are absolutely certain of handsome
dividends from this coal alone, there being 52
feet of it In eight veins, all above water level.
As to quality, we cannot do better than quote
the following report of the test of Montezuma
coal made by the Quartermaster General's De-
rart:nent. Washington. D. c.. and addressed to
Major Ruhlen, Quartermaster, Seattle, Wat-h-
lnrton. as follows:
GOOD COAL. FAYS THE GOVERNMENT.
"I am directed by the Quartermaster General
t" advise you that the Paid sample (Montezuma
<"ca!> has be<-n carefully tested by this office
and Â«as found to have an equivalence of eight-
fen hundred and fifty-nine <1SM) pounds to the
cord of standard oak wood.
"This coal was tried also in a blacksmith's
forge, and was found to yield a heavy welding
heat "
Aeiompanyinpr thin report is a tabular state-
men- of tests of various coals in use on the
Pacific Coast.

"We: ing-ton Coal. British Columbia ;o<Â« lbs \u25a0
f=outh Prairie. Washington 1973 lbs
MONTEZUMA .:..... 1SM , bs
It will be seen from the above that our Mon-
tezuna Coal has nearly eight and one-half (S.4)
per cent greater heating power than the cele-
brated Nanaimo Coal and Welsh Anthracite,
end falls very little short of Pennsylvania An-
thracite itself. In this respect. Considering that
the Montezuma Coal was taken directly from
the mines unwashed, this is indeed a remark-
Eble Ehowing.
WHAT PRACTICAL MEN SAY
ABOUT MONTEZUMA COAL.
P.e?er.tly quantities of coal from our new
celetrated " Blacksmith" vein (7 feet wide)
were submitted to certain manufacturing firms
in Tacoma for thorough testing In a practical
\u25a0way. The following is one of several letters
Fho-ning just how these coals behave on the
iorge:
Colo:iel C. W. Thompson.
President Montezuma Mining Co.,
Tacoma, Wash.
TACOMA. Wash., Oct. L 1901.
Deir E'.r: We gave the coal you sent us a
thorough trial, and find the following result:
Fim we used your coal for five hours doing
h'avr, solid work, largely in welding, and
found it gave the very best satisfaction, making
a gcod strong heat, free from sulphur, and
C'jite fre* from clinkers, in fact, during the en-
tire Ive hours' work it made but t lbs 6 or of
clinker, ar.d a part of that was welding sand.
Your coal 1s not quite as heavy as the Penn-
sylvania Cumberland blacksmith coal, but tak-
ing it altogether, it ranks with that coal for
general blacksmith purposes, end the Pacific
Coar: is to be congratulated on having such a
blacl- smith coal as yours to supply the large
and .jrowing demand.
I understand the price of your coal Is $10 per
ton celivered, IT so, please send us as soon as
convenient a carload. Yours truly.

By J. R. Turner, Manager.
When it is remembered that the company has
practically unlimited quantities of this coal
vhlch,-it jÂ£_fstimated, can be mined and placed
en the cars for $1.15 per ton. the values behind
Meet izuraa shares can be understood. . The
McntÂ»rjma Mining Company's Ehares with the
ccal er-d copper back of them are at present
prices unquestionably the best investment now
offered to the cubllc.
ANNUAL MEETING.
The annual meeting of the stockholders was
held la Taccma, Sept. 10. The California
Branch Advisory Board was represented by Mr.
J. S. C. Thompson. Mr. "W. A. C. Smith, ex-

port, of which the report of the Secretary and
Treajuerer Is a condensed etatement. Â£xpert
AceouaUnt Smith, in concluding his report

The profits are dividends. It must be remem-
bered that the policy of the Montezuma Mining
Company makes it Imperative that every eU r-
plus 3ollar derived from the sale of coal must
be paid In dividends to shareholders. That the
development of the copper properties may be
continued without interruption it Is necessary
that, additional shares be sold. These shares
are absolutely free from the element of specu-
lation, since regular dividends will be paid on
Siem from the products cf the coal mines.

STOCK MTD BOND EXCHANGE.
NEW HAVEN. Conn., Oct. 22.â Yale de
feated tlie Bates College eleven this af
ternoon in a game rendered spectacular
by the presence of more than 10,000 Yale
alumni, students and guests. The final
score was 21 to 0. Yale scored four
touchdowns, but only one was converted
Into a goal.
From the moment \u25a0 of the first scrim
mage it becam& evident that the same
surprising skill still remained in the great
players who had often brought victory to
Yale. Although they were soon puffing,
thwy were still in every play with a fire
and dash which amazed the spectators.
"Pa" Corbin, at center, was the same
great center as of old. Heffelfinger, at
guard, tore his way through the players
and into- the thick of it like a locomo
tive. Gordon Brown was a. counterpart.
Chamberlain and Murphy, at the tackles,
were Just as sturdy as ever, while at the
ends Josh Hartwell and Johnny Hall de
lighted the "crowds with the consummate
tactics of the end rusher. At quarter
McCormick was the same masterful gen
eral. McClung, on his first dash for the
end, resorted to that thrilling dodge
\u25a0which made him a marvel in the early
'90s. Brink Thorne was the same hurd
ling, plunging, implacable halfback, and
at fullback Butterworth brought
the days when the football world was as
tounded at his prowess as a line-bucker
and long, low-kicking fullback.
The old players soon began to feel the
effects of poor condition, however, and
substitutes began to go in. Corbin gave
way to Cutten, and Cross, Chadwick,
Armstrong, Ely, Sharpe and Hale went
in one by one. In spite of their, best
modern football the college team could
not score, however, and the final score
stood 12 to 0 in favor of the stars.

"Walter Camp, the dean of Yale football,

"Pa" Corbin. F. Gordon Brown, Heffel
finger, Burt Chamberlain, former captain

nence on the field and in the kick-off line
were Harry Cross, a guard; Chad wick,
a tackle, and Cullen, a center.
Walter Camp kicked off, 'â¢.mid tremen
dous cheering. The kick was a short
one and the college runner was quickly
clowned. The star team was then re
duced to eleven players, who lined up for
the first scrimmage^, as follows: Left
end, Hartwell; left tackle, Murphy; left
guard, Heffelfinger; N center,- Cprbin;

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 22.â Football
of an extraordinary, character was wit
nessed by the bl-centennial guests at
Yale field this afternoon^ when a team
composed of the most famous - stars
among Yale's former players lined up
against the substitute varsity eleven.
Despite the fact that they were undis
ciplined and unconditioned, the veterans
outplayed their younger rivals from start
to finish, and during the contest the
star's goal was never In danger,\ while
the old-timers succeeded in making two
touchdowns, both of which were con
verted into goals. The score in the first
half stood: Stars, 12; second eleven, 0.
The game was played immediately after
the regularly scheduled game between
the Yale varsity and Bates, and all of
the 12,000 spectators remained to witness
the old football against the new.
At the first Hne-up for the kick-off
there was a bewildering array of stars.
JSvery former Yale player of prominence
who had returned for the festival was in
football togs and all were lined up In a
sort of dress parade for the kick-off.

his sixth lecture in the University of Cal

Men's Christian Association Auditorium
last evening, the subject being the last
half of Professor Greene's lecture on
"Renaissance Art in Italy." It was de
lightfully treated and although, as In the
former lectures given in this series the
detail was necessarily somewhat technical,
the clearness with which the subject was
handled brought it well within range of
the audience. The illustrations were prin
cipally from the masterpieces of Michael
Ar-eio and Raphael. On next Tuesday
the subject will be "Continental Illustra
tion" and on the succeeding Tuesday

It is not expected that the Railroad
Commissioners will ' eo deeply into the
case to-day, but will, fix a date for the re
hearing of the case. â¢
The Railroad Commissioners will hold
a special meeting to-day to consider the
Bakersfleld transportation rate oil case.
The Commissioners rendered a decision in
reference to the matter three weeks ago,
ordering the Southern Pacific Company
and the Santa Fe Railway Company to
make a slight reduction in their charges
for the transportation of petroleum.
The railroad companies in return filed a
document protesting against this lower
rate. .

Maguire & Gallagher allege on behalf
of their client that the ordinance deprives
persons of their liberty and pronertv
without due process of law and denies to
persons the equal protection of the laws
that the ordinance is unreasonable arbl'
trary and oppressive and permits' arbi

useful occupations. v .. rr"
The granting of such a privilege would sub
ject the residents and adjacent property own
ers to a serious nuisance in the shape of a so
called Japanese laundry, which would be In
jurious to the comfort of the residents of that
section, as well as deteriorate the value of
their property. ,;â¢,-- i>- _
George Tsukamoto, a subject of the
Mikado, Is determined to engage in the
steam laundry business in this city, even
though it may be necessary to call to his
aid the entire land and naval forces of
the United States to enforce his rights
under the national constitution. He has
taken one case to the United States Su
preme Court and has just started in to
serve a Police Court sentence of 100 days*
imprisonment for violating an ordinance
of- the Board of Supervisors prohibiting
the maintenance of steam engines and
-boilers within certain specified limits.
Tsukamoto was taken before United
States District Judge de Haven yester
day on a writ of habeas corpus petitioned
for by his attorneys, Maguire & Galla
gher. The petition-' recited that Tsuka
moto Aad / expended $6000 in outfitting a
modern steam laundry at the northwest
corner of San Jose avenue and Twenty
third street. In this city, and that the
Board of Supervisors had refused to grant
him a permit to carry on the business,
the Fire Department Committee of the
board having made the following report
upon his application:
The directors of the Camera Club stated
last night that they had made frequent
'complaints as to the inefficiency of the
elevator in the building and that early
last evening the machine was disabled and
the attendant had been warned . not to
carry too many passengers at one time.
There was a scene of excitement last
night in the Academy of^^Sciences build
ing, 819 Market street, when the elevator,
crowded with ladies, fell from the third
story to the basement. -,
The Ip.dies had left the rooms of the
California Camera Club, where an enter
tainment had been held, and entered the
elevator to reach the street. Dozens of
the club members -and their friends were
walking down the stairs when the acci
dent happened and they rushed to the aid
of those in the disabled elevator.
The crash of broken glass, mingled with
the screams of the ladies, attracted the
attention of persons on Market street and
a call was sent for an ambulance, which,
however, was not needed.
Mrs. LÂ». D. Hitchcock was cut on the
head by broken glass and was removed to
her home by friends. Mrs. C.'E. Baldwin
and her daughter were severely jarred by
the fall and a number of* other fair pas
sengers suffered from shock.
Peter O'Eourke, a Mission hoodlum, ap
peared In â¢ Judge Cabaniss' court yester
day on the charge of robbery. He was
instructed as. to his rights and the case
was continued till .to-day.
Edwin L. Eaton; gateman for the South
ern Pacific at the crossing, at Sixteenth
and garrison streets,' was beaten and
robbed by four men Sunday night on Six
teenth 1 street, between ilarrison and Bry
ant.-'They took $4 30 from him, all the
money he had-in.his pockets. O'Rourke
was arrested early - Monday morning and
was positively identified by 'Eaton as | one
of the men. who robbed" him. -.The police
expect to arrest the other three-men soon;
He Is Accused of Being One of Four

O'ROTJBKE ARRESTED ON
CHARGE OF ROBBERY.
At a point on East street, which, Bardon
says was about two blocks from the ferry
building, the : hold-up occurred. He was
beaten into insensibility by two men while
a third robber went through his pockets
and took the money out of them. Bardon
lay where he fell until early yesterday
morning. When he recovered conscious
ness he. says he started up Market street
and spent the day looking about the city.
He suffered considerably from the effects
of the beating and having no money he
decided last night to seek the aid. of the
police. . . . Â» \u25a0 :;V-; v
Two weeks ago the boys reached Sac
ramento, after having tramped from tho
Atlantic shore. While there Kimball was
taken seriously ill and he was obliged to
go to a hospital. Bardon came here with
out his traveling partner and arrived .late
Monday night on an Oakland ferry-boat.
Being a stranger In the city he wandered
along East street in the direction of North
Beach. When the lads commenced their
journey they were given $100. Bardon had
but $5 left, of hia share when he stepped
from the boat.
After traveling nearly 4000 miles* on a
wager Claude Bardon, aged 17 years, was
held up and robbed of his last cent on
the water front Monday night. Bardon
appeared at the Central police station last
night and related the story of his ad
ventures, after which he was given lodg
ings in the prison. *
According to Bardon's story, he- and a
companion named Will Klmball started on
foot from Portland, Me., January l*last
and were to receive $1000 if they succeeded
in crossing the continent and returning
within a year. Bardon says he undertook
the trip because of poverty. His father
and his mother . perished with seventy
others in the wreck of the steamer Lady
Elder off the Maine coast tome -months
before. \u25a0:.---.

OAKLAND, Oct. 22. â The two contest
ants for victory In the ring before tha
Reliance Club of this city to-morrow
night are in the best of condition, and
there is more interest in this event than
has been shown in any minor flght in
many months. It is felt that Mowatt
must make a good showing if he is going
to build up a reputation on this coast that
Is equal to his Chicago record, and Irwin
will have to do his best if he- is going to
maintain that which he already has.
Both men have been training hard and
are in first-class condition.
If Mowatt wins he will probably be
matched with Billy De Coursey in .Los
Angeles._an offer of $1000 having been
made for the match, so that this 13 an
additional inducement to make the flght
one that will be a record maker.

give first aid to the injured. Dave Sul
livan played to the grana stand, but when
a sniall boy told him to "Go aw-a-y back"
he felt sore. Levings and Sheehan shared
errors between them. The ball was so hot
that they dropped it every time it touched
their mitts. Pat McGee guarded the third
cushion, but fell aslep at the switch.
The small boy occupied a seat in the
press box and made life miserable for the
'"cops." He told them that they were a
band of lobsters and ought to be brought
up before the Commissioners for playing
"rotten" ball.
When the game was over the scorer

Dick Cullen and Harry Forbes were the

James Cromley lasted less than a min

down several times. He was Just able to
respond to call of time. He finally went
down and stayed down.
Barney Driscoll and Tom Ward went
four fast rounds, the former getting the
decision. Both were tired when the end
came. It seemed either man's fight up
to the last moment.
Frank McConnell, the clever feather

still in half a round. He devoted all his
energies to Little's body and stopped him
finally with a right to the body.
Jack Welch had enough In one. round
with Frank George. He went down, in

sounded, much to his disgust, and he waa
carried to his corner. He had to fight
again, but made it as short as possible.

Provisions were steady at Chicago, but the
outlook there is not bullish, as the market
goes down every day or two and never gets
back again. Hogs are lower at Chicago, and
while receipts at the moment are moderate
there are plenty in the country ready to be k
shipped in at short notice. I
This market shows little change, though few*
dealers now ask 14%c for Hams, the tendency
in these goods being rather downward. Lard

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â Waiting on the North
ern Pacific settlement best describes the con
dition of to-day's stock market. As the convic
tion is general that the final steps in the set
tlement must await the presence in this city of
J. P. Morgan and as that gentleman was re
ported still in the Norhwest on his return
across the continent, the outlook for immedi
ate activity in the stock market waÂ« not prom
ising. Whether any significance attaches . to
the fact that out of the Northwest came the
influence which moved the stock market to
strength and activity late in the day can only
be surmised. There was no clearly defined ex
planation of the movement, but it grew and
spread from the Chicago and Northwestern
stocks and embraced the principal railroads in
the Northwest and the Vanderbilts all the way
to the seaboard. Northwestern itself rose an
extreme 6 points, the preferred 10, Chicago, St.
Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha 10. the preferred
13. Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul 3 and
the preferred 4%. Considerable sympathetic
effect was produced by this at the last," result
ing In advances of as much as a point in some
of the Pacifies, grangers and half-priced spe
cialties. New York Central and the so-called
Junior Vanderbilta advanced 1 to 1%.
An impression has gone abroad that the de
velopment pending in the Vanderbllt system
is to take the form of a melon-cutting for the
benefit of Lake Shore. The recent increase in
the valuation of subsidiary stocks held in its
treasury provides material for an extra 'dis
bursement, which would operate Indirectly, to
the benefit of New Y/rk -Central. The pamph
let reports from the! Great Northern Rallway>
notwithstanding thV ar g e decrease in net earn
ings reported as * result of laet year's spring
wheat shortage/contained so nattering an ac
count of the general conditions in that region
and the large movement of immigrants thither
that it was an important influence in the rise
of all the Northwestern railroads. Great
Northern preferred itself fell 1% at first, owing
to the 6howing of net earnings, but recovered
with the late movement in the group. There
was continued speculation ln Amalgamated
Copper, the stock receding early on the decline
in raw copper in London, and the further
spread of futures below that for spot, indicat
ing the expectation of a coming fall in prices.
Amalgamated Copper, however, recovered with
the late buying movement in the market. Large
lending of money on call, coming from the
banks affiliated with the Standard Oil patty,
was interpreted by the speculators as an Indi
cation that the recent attitude of opposition
to a cpeculative advance by that party had
been modified.
The banks received payments for an addition
al half-million of gold at Pacific Coast points
and there were reports that the movement of
currency to the South was declining, .although
$275,000 was deposited at the eub- treasury for
transfer to New Orleans. From a money stand
point the further violent rise in foreign ex
change was not reassuring. There seems to be
something like a rush of cotton this week to
export points, but this has not had the slight
est influence ln checking the advance in ex-

The San Jose Association has again reduced
the price of last year's Prunes, this time from
3o to' 2%c for the four sizes, the object being
to clean up the old Prunes before the new crop
is placed on the market. A good many of the
new Prunes have already passed out of grow
ers' hands. These continued cuts on the part
of the association are lowering the market for
the new crop. The demand is slow. In this
respect, however. Prunes are no worse off than
the other fruits, all being dull, both here and
in the East. Raisins continue unsettled, owing
t6 the differences between the factions at
Fresno. Nuts are quiet and there is no especial

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Some spot chartering is
being done at 33s &d, usual options. The char
tered wheat fleet in port has a registered ton
nage of 79,250,. against 33,830 tons on the same
date last year; disengaged, 20,620 tons, against
1608; on the way to this port, 206,49a tons,
against 161,153.
WHEATâ The foreign markets are showing
Ies3 firmness, notwithstanding the damage to
the Argentine crop, which, according to private
cables, will amount to 50 per cent in the prin
cipal Wheat provinces. The weather continues
bad and further damage is feared. Bradstreet's
gives the following estimate of the stock on
hand: East of the Rockies, an increase of 2,
500,000 bushels; Europe and afloat, a decrease
of 200,000; total net increase, 2,300.000 bushels. ,
Chicago opened dull and a shade lower on ca
bles. The movement in the Northwest is not
what had been expected, and the elevator peo
ple think that it will not be realized, and that
the crop in North Dakota has been overestl
i mated.
' In this market there was considerable doing
in December at lc advance, but May showed
no change. Shipping grades were unchanged.

CHICAGO, Oct. 22.â There was little," news of
European business in wheat at the outset and
December, wheat opened unchanged to a shade
higher at 70%@70%c on steady cables. The trade
was largely local with'no early reports of ex
ports. Conditions were ready, therefore, fop a
&lump in prices when a sharp decline began in
corn. Following this influence December wheat
sagged off to 7UV4@V0%c. ' Primary receipts had
also increased considerably, but these factors
toward lower prices were soon overbalanced by
renewed reports of drought damage to the crop
of Arcentina. Under this influence December
regained its early loss and sold to 70%(Ji)70%c,
though there was nothing like any active trade.
Continental cables Jailed to respond to the
Argentine news and December closed only
steady, a shade higher, at 70%@70%c.
Corn gave way early under a renewal of the
selling that set in yesterday, but recovered
sharply on an oversold market. December
closed weak, %c depressed, at 53V4@35V4c.
1 Oats had a dull and narrow market. Decem
ber closed steady unchanged at 35%c.
Provisions ruled easy on a large supply \u25a0 of
hogs and a resulting lower hog market. There
was a recovery toward the close of the session
by covering for shorts, 'tut the cash demand
was sluggish and January pork closed 7%c
lower, lard 7%c down, ribs 2%c lower.

Petitions in Insolvency.
Bloojl has been shed under the shadow
of the Custom-house flag. It flowed yes
terday during; the progress of a fist flght,
the principals being Harry Thomas, a
popular Custom-house broker, and Lloyd
Spencer, messenger in the offlce of First
Deputy Farley.
It is an admitted state of facts that Mr.
Thomas went to Deputy Farley's desk to
have some papers signed, and, Mr. Far
ley being temporarily absent, Mr. Thomas
expressed his displeasure. Messenger
Spencer took exception to the remark,
and from this point the admitted state
of facts diverges Into two statements, one
being that Thomas applied an insulting
name to Spencer, and the other that
Spencer called Thomas a liar and that
Thomas resented it in words the opposite
of soothing. When Thomas left the desk
both parties were at white heat.
Thomas and Spencer met on the steps
of the Custom-house after lunch, and
Spencer peremptorily demanded an apol
ogy. Thomas refused, and the gage of
battle \u25a0was resorted to. Both pricipals,
with several friends, immediately repaired
to Oregon street, a cul de sac beginning
on Battery street, opposite the Custom
house and running about half a block
until intercepted by a fruit-packing estab
lishment. Between an ale house and the
fruit house the crowd piled a barricade
of empty boxes to cut off the view from
the main street, and Thomas and Spen
cer, peeling off their .coats and vests,
sailed into each other with much gritting
of teeth and many grunts between blows.
Two rounds were fought, at the end of
which period both combatants, bleeding
and breathless, were* separated by the
spectators and honor was adjudged to
have been satisfied. The end of the bat
tle was hastened by a report that the
British and Italian Consuls, whose win
dows overlook Oregon street, had sent
special messengers for squads of marines
from English and Italian men of war to
stop the gory contest. . '. â¢

BLOOD IS SHED
UNDER THE FLAG
NOME COURT IS WELL RUN.
" SEATTLE, Oct. 22.â According to Judge
H. A. Day, who has arrived from Nome,
the immense accumulation of legal com
plications in Nome has been untangled
and is not likely to again assume a threat
ening aspect to the country. Credit for
the relieved situation Judge Day gives to
Judge James Wickersham, who is tem
porarily filling the place of Judge Arthur
H^ Noyes.
"Since Judge Wickersham has assumed
control," said Judge Day, "he has taken
up and rendered decisions in all cases
where a question of law was involved.
The court docket is practically cleaned up
and the Judge announced that he would
hold a term of court beginning October
7 witU Jury service.. The cases set for
trial are to be peremptorily disposed of.
The fact of the matter is that Judge
Wickersham has untangled the badly
mixed court calendar and by his severely
upright, Judicial demeanor has gained the
respect'- and regard of all. If he takes
a case under advisement as a rule he
renders a decision the next day.
"Judge Wickersham's executive ability
Is something unusual, i There is a much
more settled feeling exhibited since the
people saw .that he was able and intended
to be ~ arbitrator in fact as well as in
name.
"One rule of Judee WIckersham is to
allow no lawyer to secure a- private order.
That was brought about owing to the pe
culiar position of affairs previously. Nor
does he allow lawyers to reach intimate
terms with him. Still another rule pro
mulgated was to the effect that Jury ser
vice within a year was sufficient cause for
a challenge on a second call to serve."

ANOTHER SCHOOL FOTTND
TO BE GREATLY CROWDED
Deputy Superintendent Kingsbury
Officially Inspects the Ever
ett Grammar.
Deputy Superintendent of Schools
Kingsbury made an ofQcial inspection yes
terday of the Everett Grammar School at
Sanchez and Sixteenth streets and found
the classes in an overcrowded condition.
In most of them there were not sufficient
desks to accommodate the pupils and
every available inch of space in the rooms
was taken up with the desks.
Iu Miss Grim's class there were forty
six pupils in what was once a lunchroom.
ICineteen desks were ranged along the
sides against the blackboard, so that chil
dren were forced to reach over the desk
to use the board. The desks were only
fifteen inches apart. Similar conditions
prevailed in Miss Lindberghs class. In the
receiving class there were fifty-five
youngsters. Miss Perl had fifty in an out
side class located in a store, with only
forty-seven seats. The eighth grade had
forty-eight pupils present and forty-six
seats. The third grade has sixty-two en
rolled. The Park School has fifty-three
pupils in a class comprising . the third,
fourth and fifth grades, and fifty-one
pupils in a class containing pupils of the
firs* and second grades. In all likelihood
a new class will be formed in the last
named school.

to X-MARSHAL VAWTER proved e
hostile > witness yesterday when
" the taking of testimony in tha
Nome contempt cases was re
sumed before Judge Heacock.
Vawter tilted his chair on the hind legs,
looked defiance at the respondents' attor
neys and drove McLaughlin to the ice
water four times during the morning ses
sion. He had his story to tell and he told
itâ sometimes so fast that even the court
reporter threw his hands upward ln de
spair. The marshal had a grievance and
he didn't care who knew it.
Vawter went Into detail when he came
to the Jim Gaylen and Senator Carter
phase of the cases. He testified to his
relations with Noyes, McKenzie and
FVost, and recited how he came to over
hear the conversations between Judge
Noyes and other parties, in which the
good name of Circuit Court, Judges and
Congressmen were categorically con
demned. Much of Vawter's testimony is
to the point without any mincing.
But Vawter was not the only man on
the stand yesterday. George V. Borch
senius took the witness chair during the
afternoon. He was the clerk of the court
over which Noyes presided, but was re
moved later by Noyes. Borchsenius re
ceived his appointment, according to his
testimony, on account of the influence of
McKenzie. He did not, however, last long
with the combination. At Seattle, where
they all rested on their way to Nome,
Borchsenius felt that he was in disfavor,
and that they wanted to give him the
slip. His life was not a merry one at
Nomeâ from his storyâ and his work none
of the pleasantest.
Day by day the attorneys drop more
and more of their pristine courtesy. Ami
cus Curiae Plllsbury and Judge McLaugh
lin have now reached the state of super
heated politeness. Their remarks sound
well, but they are full of sarcasm and
Irony. Now and then they have a tilt,
and then Judge McLaughlin drinks ice
water. Francis J. Heney, second to Mc-
Laughlin. is also in a warlike and argu
mentative mood.
The case of Joseph K. Wood came up
before the Circuit Court of Appeals at
the morning session, but the court re
fused to pass sentence until the testimony
was read.
Conversation of June, 1901.
The morning session opened with a con
tinuation of Ex-Marshal Vawter's cross
examination by Attorney McLaughlin.
The .first question propounded was;
"Referring now, Mr. Vawter, to the conver
sation you overheard in June, 1891. in which
you said something about Judge Noyes' criti
cism on Judge Ross, do you remember the
date?"
"It is either June 9 or June 16. It was either
the day before or a week before I went to
St. Michael. We were two weeks getting to St.
Michael because we were stuck ln the ice. We
arrived in Nome on the 4th. I made the mem
orandum immediately upon my return to Nome.
I made It in case I was ever asked about it, to
specify the time exactly."
"Where was that talk held?"
"That talk was in Judge Noyes' chambers or
the room adjoining the chambers. I think Bell
was present."
"Where were you when you heard this?"
"In my office, which adjoined Judge Noyes.'
I was about nine feet from the door between
the rooms. I recognized Bell's voice besides
that of Judge Noyes. There was nothing but
a thin board partition between the rooms and
I could hear plainly."
"You didn't put your ear to the wall. I bup
pose?V
"No, sir; never at any time."
"Now have you related every conversation
you have overheard concerning this matter and
ln which Judge Noyes figures?"
"I think I have."
"Did you state substantially all Mr: Frost
said when he handed you that letter?"
"When, he handed me that letter and told me
I must swear in the posse comltatus and pre
vent these people from getting the gold dust
he also said, 'you must obey this court and
never mind the other courts.' "
Not in With, the Gang. v
"When dlfl you 6end your resignation to
Senator Carter?"
"I think it was in October, 1900."
"Yesterday you testified that Mr. Gaylen had
disappeared."
"Yes, I feared for his safety and was organ
izing a party to search for him."
"When did he return?"
"He went to see Senator Carter and came
back ln September."
"When didjrou forward your resignation?"
"Soon after Gaylen's return."
"Then you sent a second part of your resig
nation, did you not?"
"About fifteen days after I withdrew my res
ignation." . .
"Notwithstanding that Senator Carter did
send in your resignation?"
"It eeems so." S \u25a0 â¢
"Did you talk with Gaylen after his return?"

_ After that a desultory cross-examina
tion followed and 'â¢ nothing more of any
jj? Borchsenius gave testimony on other pe
culiar methods of doing business then In
vogue In Judge Noyes' court and made a
statement concerning the calling of a
grand jury: .. - ;
.V-'"lri January or February, 1901, Judge Noyes
advised me to call a Grand Jury. I put in
a list of 300 names and' Joseph K. Wood and
John T. Reed selected twenty-three of them.
The following day J Judge -Noyes handed- me
twenty-three names, saying that- he wanted
them as a Grand Jury, as it was the custom
In; the States to appoint in that manner."
'\u25a0 Borchsenius further testified that , he
did not wish to pay the bills that McLain,
Carroll and Carson, put in for detective
service, \u25a0 but was ordered to do so. Also
that he complained of .Deputy Clerk John
T. Peed for the manner in which he drew
juries and that he received fees, but
Judge Noyes would pay no attention to
him. _
The cross-examination of Borchsenius
was undertaken by McLaughlin.
." "I. think I heard you eay that Mr. McKenzie
had secured transportation for the whole party,
did you not?" â¢ â â¢ â¢ \u25a0 . '
: "So I was informed."
"Did you complain to Judge Noyes of Reed's
delay in the preparation of the papers?" i .
"No. sir. I didn't think It would do any
good."
"Had you done anything on the transcript?"
"Just started it." â¢ -â¢ -â¢./ rV -
Then the line of questions of the amicus
curiae was devoted 'to- the preparation of
the transcripts or a record of the proceed
ings in the five cases which were to t be
appealed to the ' Circuit Court. John T.
Reed, a deputy clerk of the court, had the
work In hand and according. to the testi
mony of Borchsenius delayed the prepara
tion of the papers ln an attempt to miss
the last boat of the season. . .
Borchsenius said . in answer to one of
Pillsbury's questions:
"Mr. Reed had charge of the making of the
transcripts and he so delayed it that I was
afraid that we would not get them out on the
last boat to 1 send to the Circuit Court of Ap
peals.".' \u25a0\u25a0.\u25a0':\u25a0
"What reasons did Noyes give for the inter
ference ln the making of the transcripts?"
"None whatever."-
Another Blow at N"oyes.
Delayed the Transcript.
"Did you have any talk with McKenzie
after the receiverships were bestowed?" Inter
rogated Plllsbury a few moments later, receiv
ing a positive answer.
"Did you go to St. Michael?"
"Yes, ln September for a special term of
court there." '. '
"Did you hear Judge Noyes Bay anything
about the writs there?"
"Yes, he said he did not know Compton and
talked elightlngly of them."
"They seemed to be anxious to keep me in
ignorance of when aud how they would leave
Seattle, for Nome."
"Was there any change in his manner to you
when you got to Nome?" H . â¢. ; â¢
"Yes, altogether different from . when we
were in Washington.". .
Then the witness of his own accord of
fered* some enlightenment. â¢
"No, - I did not. It there was, it was filed
afterward."
"Did Judge Noyes pay anything to you about
going to St. Michael?"
"Yes; shortly after we came, but I wanted
to be on the mining ground and refused to
"When did you learn of any proceedings be
ing commenced in reference to receiverships,"
asked Pillsbury.
â¢ "On the evening of July 23 I went with Mr.
Stenges to Judge Noyes' office and found the
papers appointing McKenzie on Judge Noyes'
desk. I also found Mr. Dickey there, and he
said Judge Noyes left them" about 9 o'clock.
They were not file-marked at that time. I
think Dickey filed them after."
"Did you see a complaint in the cases?" i
Vawter left- the stand and the amlcua
curiae called for George V. Borchsenius,
clerk of the court at Nome. He also had a
grievance and . he told it j without much
coaxing or urging. Borchsenius went into
Nome with McKenzie, Judge Noyes,
Dickey and a number of others who have
since arrayed thmselves on one side or
the other of this case.
Borchsenius on Deck.
McLaughlin wanted to prod the witness
with personal questions then and said: â¢
1 "How much money did you get to pay your
expenses to come here?"
"I have not been paid any money; I never
asked any."
Vawter then told at the Instigation of
Pillsbury how Frost came to him and
asked for a deputy to do some detective
work. He got the deputy, one McLain
by name, but his bills were paid by Judge
Noyes.
The re-examination was short. Then
McLaughlin had his opportunity again.
"You Bay you 'were asked to appoint L. D.
McLain Deputy Marshal ! to do detective work
by Frost, and you afterward learned that he
was engaged to spy upon the defendant's at
torneys in the mining claims cases?"
"Yes, sir." ' .
"You said he was paid on an order from
Judge Noyes?" ! â¢ i
"Yes, sir. He was paid as a detective, and
not as a Marshal." â¢ ' .
*.; : +
visited by Judjje Noyes and Frost after
the riling of the charge against himself
and both said they were sorry for it.
Then the friend of the court came back
to Gaylen, Senator Carter's nephew. â¢
"What did Gaylen 8ay7"
"He said I balled the^whole thine ud and
Carter would be very sore over it Then I
missed him and wantefl-to get a posse coml
tatus to search for him, fearing that he was
foully dealt with. When Gaylen came bacK
from his trio to Senator Carter he said, 'I
have seen Noyes and Frost and both want you
removed.' He went out to see Carter and an
attorney for these cases."
"What were the relations between Judge
Noyes and Mr. Frost the time these, writs ar
rived there?"
"Very thick."
McLaughlin switched his line of inter
rogation at this point and began o cross
examination of Vawter on the differences
that arose betwee-n the witness on one
side and Judge Noyes and C. E.. B. Frost
on the other.
"Did you connect Judge Noyes with the
charges filed against you ln Washington?"
"Noyes sent Frost to George Lekely. Frost
eald to Lekely that Noyes wanted to find out
something- against me ln order to get me out of
the way. I knew these things were going on
and had been Informed that they were trying
to make a raid on me."
"Did you rely on Lekely?"
"Yes, I think he was all; right. He was ap
pointed at the instance of Senator Carter."
"When did you first learn that they were
making a raid on you?"
"Some time ln October, but I- couldn't believe
It at first. I believed It when Jim Gaylen got
back from Senator Carter."
"When did Lekely Inform you that Frost ap
proached him?"
"It may have been November or December."
"Was Judge Noyes and Frost friendly to you
at this time?' -
"They appeared so."
"Do you remember having a conversation
about this time ln relation to an offer of money
in the Jersey Hotel when Judge Noyes and
Frost and Wood were present?"
"That â¢was in reference to a conversation I
had with another man. I don't know about
Wood being present."
"Do you remember knowing at that time that'
the defendant in these mining suits had made
an application to discbarge Receiver McKen
zle?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you not have another conversation In
front of the Golden Gate Hotel with Judge
Noyes that if he would discharge orders of re
ceivership for McKenzle that it would be worth
$20,000 to him?"
"No, sir." flashed the witness at his interrog
ator. â¢ .
"Did you mention that he would get any
thing at all?" . . .. ,
"I did not."
"Did you mention anything about benefits?"
"I did not."
"A short time after that did you meet Frost
on the street and did he not tell you that Judge
Noyes complained about the talk and did you
not say you were sorry that Noyes took it se
riously?"
"No, sir. I said that was a damn lie and
that if the Judge said I offered him money he
was not telling the truth."
"Do you recollect the next day that Judge
Noyes was passing a house that you were fix
ing, and you said that you must have been
'nutty' when you approached him and that he
should not say anything about it and that you
would be a good officer thereafter?"
"No, sir; that's made out of whole cloth. I
never had such a conversation. I told him once
that I didn't want to get in a fight with him
and that our offices ought to harmonize."
â¢Ahout the Bribe Offer.
"On the next day did you. Wood, Frost and
Noyes meet in the Jersey Hotel and discuss
these matters?"
"We discussed what a certain fellow had said
to me on the street." . '
"Did you ln the course of that conversation,
state that you heard he could get $20,000 'if Mc-
Kenzle was discharged; that you didn't think
he would take it seriously and that you hoped
he would not let it go further?" - 1
"No, air. I did not say that even In sub
stance." - .
"Did you give Frosty the name of the man who
would furnish the money?"
"The man I suppose you refer to hasn't 15
cents."
"Did these men have nothing to do with
your resignation?"
"No, sir."
"Did not Gaylen state to you ln substance
that there was a charge filed against you in
Washington on account of this very offer of
$20,000 and that this was I the reason of the
demand of the resignation?"
"I saw a letter from Gaylen, written by
Carter, in which it was stated that unless I
resigned I would be summarily discharged."
"Was there anything like the conversation
I pictured at the hotel?" ' :
"No, nothing like it. Many times Judge
Noyes and I had friendly confidential talks.
He would come to me with anonymous letters
and say his life was threatened. I offered him
the protection of my deputies." . \u25a0
"Did you not avow . that you .would get
even with Noyes after your resignation?"
"No, sir."
\u25a0 "Did you not say a few days ago In the lob
by of the Palace Hotel that. you wanted the
opportunity of saying Judge Noyes was a
liar?" . . -,
"I don't remember It." .;
"When did the defendants have the- gold
dust. and when did you get it?"
"In October, 1900." . .. . . *
"When did you overhear tho 1 conversation
about Judge Ross?" â¢\u25a0. , . \u25a0
"In June, 1901." ' .
"And you made a memorandum of It 7" â¢: ' \u25a0

McLaughlin- went back to- the Jersey
Hotel conversation and got this explana
.tion from the witness:
"I told him that this man came to me and
said if he could . get the receiver discharged
he could . make a lot of money. I- told > him
that he couldn't approach Judge Noyes and
the man left. I told Judge Noyes, because â¢ I
was in tho habit of telling him whatever hap
pened."' , - . . . -. â¢ t â v,"
''What receiver? What claim? Who was
the m8n?" |
."I don't know what receiver, what claim,
but his name was May â sometimes . called col
onel because he wore a plug hat."
"Did you ever see May after that?"
"I saw him In September in Washington,
where I, think he lives. He's a real estate
man." \
Here, ended the cross-examination,
i Plllsbury then took up the re-examina
tion.
.. "Was there any thought that you attempted
to bribe Judge Noyes?"
"Well, Frost seems to think bo."
"Was that letter received from Judge Noyes
after or before the conversation in the Jersey
Hotel r* .
"The conversation about May took place ln
August, 1900, some time before the writs of
sujiersedeas arrived." â¢ -
"I want you to state whether you had any
other purpose than friendliness to Judge Noyes
when you stated that conversation?" . .
"No other. He didn't think anything about
money at that time."

At the beginning- of the afternoon ses
sion in response to an interrogation . by

"Tea, and he said that I was not ln with the

"Did you find out that Frost had filed charges
against you?"
"Yes. Eome time afterâ I think it was la Oc

In their haste to escape the burglars
overlooked a considerable sum of money
which the proprietor had concealed.
When the police began their Investiga
tions they found that the tiurglars had
forced an entrance into the building ad
joining, which is being remodeled, taken
a rone and let themselves down to the
next structure. Another, piece of rone was
made fast and passed through a skylight
over the pooltable. It was by this means
they effected an entrance and exit. The
police are inclined to believe that it was
some one well acquainted with the place
who committed the burglary.
When J. L. Hedrick, the proprietor,
opened the place in the morning he found
a rope hanging from the roof through the
Ekyliglit. Bottles of wine and a bottle of
beer were standing on the pooltable. A
brace and a bit taken from a rear room
were on the counter, and a number of
painters' tools, taken from an adjoining
building 1 , were found scattered on the
floor.
Some time between midnight and 6
o'clock yesterday morning burglars en
tered the Waldorf, a saloon at 5 Taylor
street, rifled a cash drawer and secured
55 SO in nickels and several hundred cigars.
They made an attempt to break open a
nickel-in-the-slot machine and also to
force their way through a partition into
the jewelry store of A. Aufrichtig ad
joining-. They were evidently frightened
off before comDletinsr their work.

IS VERY CRUEL
Margaret: May : . Bowhay, wife of Leon
ard Bowhay, the . proprietor of a ladles'
tailoring parlor at -616 Sutter Btreet. com
menced divorce proceedings yesterday
against her husband. In her complaint
she alleses that for fourteen years her
husband has treated her ln a harsh, brutal
and inhuman manner. She asks the
court to grrant her a decree, award her the
custody of their four children, allow her
J750 a month alimony and for an order
restraining 1 her husband from forcing an
entrance to the Bowhay home at 40
Twenty-second avenue.
Mrs. Bowhay alleges ln her complaint
that August 10. 18S7, she married Bowhay,
who at that time was ln her employ in
the ladles' tailoring establishment at 41
Post street. "Within a few daya after
the marriage, Mrs. Bowhay alleges, her
husband assumed the management of her
business and In addition to compelling her
to work for him commenced a course of
cruel treatment. On one occasion, Mrs.
Bowhay alleges,, her husband locked her
in the sitting-- room at the tailoring par
lors 'and held her prisoner for several
hours. She further alleges that her hus
band compelled her to sleep on a cot at
tho store and that- he compelled her to
remain at work up to within a few days
of the birth of her eldest child. Ten days
after the child was born he made her
leave her bed and return to her place in
the store. "While she was seriously ill in
1893, Mrs. Bowhay alleges, her husband
boasted that while she was sick he was
spending his time with other women, tak
ing them to theaters and buying them
flowers. She remonstrated with him, she
alleges, and he cursed her and struck her,
thereby making her illness- much more
serious. Among \u25a0 the many other acts of
cruelty which Mrs. Bowhay alleges her
husband to be guilty of are: Using pro
fane and vulgar language toward her in
the presence of their children; compelling
his stepson, her son by a former marriage,
to eat in the kitchen; compelling her to
practice the strictest economy and making
her such a small allowance that she was
often harassed by creditors. â¢
Mrs. Bowhay also alleges that her hus
band spends $1000 per month In a riotous
and extravagant manner and that out of
the tailoring business, which, she claims,
yields a profit of $1500 monthly, she re
ceives only ?250.
On October 19 of this year, she alleges,
while she was ill at home, Bowhay
called and demanded to see her. She re
fused to see him and .thereupon he seized
one of the children and endeavored to
drag it from the house.
