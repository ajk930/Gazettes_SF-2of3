spector "W. T. Sullivan of Denver has just
turned a clever trick. He placed Ernest
J. Walter, a Schuyler. Nebr., merchant,
in jail in Omaha to-day for attempting
to blackmail Senator Thomas Kearns of
Utah out of $5000. He used the mails in
the endeavor and his bad penmanship
brought him to grief. Walter also wrote
a threatening letter to the Senator's wife
demanding $2000. and stated that if he did
not get it he would kill the children.
Senator Kearns put the letters in the
hands of Inspector Sullivan, who went to
Sohuyler and got his man. Some years
ago Walter lived in Salt Lake City and
there became acquainted with the fact
that Kearns had money and a very
charming family. Walter was a mer
chant, but led a rather fast life. In
Schuyler he runs the Cash Store and
stands well In the community. He hails
from Wisconsin originally ard sprang
from a good family. The letter he wrote
to the Senator reads as" follows:
SALT LAKE CITT, Feb. 19.â Mr. Thomas
KrarriF: Permit me to be the first to con
cratulate you on your new honors. You are
new hapry In your fortunes, in your family
end in your wife; you have a sufficiency of
VtlM worM"s goods and to spare. But how
did you get your start in life? Dead men tell
no tales. I v.ant JoOOO. and I must have It
right away. I have nothing to live for. If
I do not get It I would as soon din with you
as In any ether way. I want JjOOO. Now. If
sou have any love for your family or any re
spect for yourself you will send me the money.

to Schuyler and get the money and your fam
ily will remain undisturbed. If it is not there
I will come to Salt Lake and you will rufTer

charge, and that a traveling man has put
him in a false light.

LONDON", March S.â Whatever negotia

Mr. Krujrer declares they can only be for
Â»n armistice â the Government cvldently
fcaÂ«5 no intention of slackening reinforce
ment?. The War Office issued a detailed
statement last evening of transports that
are to Â«?ail for South Africa within the
enming week with 12,000 troops.
The casualty list reveals the fact that
two officers were killod at Llchtenburg
March. Lord Kitchener's telegram, "Am
pending reinforcements" was dated
March 6. Evidently, therefore, the fighting
continued for some days and further ad
vices are awaited with anxiety.
According to the Daily Mail's dispatches
General Dewrt and Steyn have separated,
the former being: at Petrusburg, west of
Bloemfontcin. and the latter at Smith
. field.
Sending Reinforcements.
Here Is the latest report from Kitchener
that causes aome uneasiness in London:
"PRETORIA. March 6.-Lichtenburg is
being attacked by Dclarey's forces; fight
jr.g continued ail day long. The garrison
consists of 200 yeomanry and 300
Northumberland Fusileers. with -two
;runs. Major Fletcher and Lieutenant
Hull art- reported killed. I am sending
reinforcements."
The progress of the bubonic plague
causes deep anxiety and apprehension In
Â«'ape Town. The Cape Government has
. decided to remove the people from one-,

precaution will be taken should the dis
ease spread tr> the troops.
The Amsterdam correspondent of the
Daily Mail pays Mr. Kruger Is informed
thaÂ» F. W. Reitz. former Stat* Secretary
Of thÂ» Transvaal, is suffering from abber- i
ration of mind.
The Times understands that the re- '
ir.alnder of the war loan will be issued in
consols, the Government having already
issued as much in short term loans and
bonds as it is likely to obtain from the
proceeds of a Transvaal loan.
Pearston Is Reoccupied.
A Cape Town special says: It is offi
cially announced that Colonel Goring re
occupied Pearston. on the great Riet
River. March 5. He says the town should
have bf^n impregnable to the Boers, but
the town guard offered inadequate resist
ance and the Boers captured the place,
together with sixty rifles, fifteen men and
10.000 rounds of ammunition.
Ixird Roberts, presiding yesterday at a
meeting of the army Temperance Society,
contrasted the moderation of the British
soldiers in South Africa with previous
campaigns. He said that It was true they
had not many opportunities to drink, hut
at BioemfontHn, Johannesburg and Pre
toria, where they did have such oppor
tunities, they were remarkably well be
haved and he never had heard a single
complair.t of a soldier being rude or im
properly behaved toward Boer women.

.The story Is told with ( a minuteness of
detail and great plausibility. The nar
rator says he is going to file mining
claims on the property and that when his
brother arrives they will go in and make
further examinations. . â¢
There were vessels of different kinds,
all of metal, and a number of tools. Seven
hammers, weighing twelve", to fifteen
pounds each, with metal handles, and a
great many chisels were among the dis
coveries. The cave is very rich with splen
did white gold quartz and there is much
copper.'
The woman is described as having re
markably long hair. From one ear hung
a heavy pendant of gqld. Near the bodies
were the dismembered skeletons of two
children, and there were numerous bones
throughout other parts of the cave. ""'
Skeletons of Children.
The chamber seemed dry, but was very
cold and there was much ice inside. On a
huge slab side by side were two hugo
human figures, those of a woman meas
uring more than seven feet In length and
a man seven feet and ten Inches long.
Both bodies were frozen solidly and in a
perfect state of preservation. The man,
had a black beard and long dark hair,
and on his left wrist was a gold band an
inch and a half wide and a quarter of an
inch thick. On the band were engraved
an antelope and a number of characters.
Another passage from the main boule
vard led the explorer to a flight of stone
steps leading down a distance of sixty
feet. ' At the bottom was a passageway
ten feet or more wide. Along this were
several Eealed vaults. One of the vaults
had a small lid resting loosely against
the main slab which Inclosed It. The ex
plorer removed It and entered.
In this same passage was a well about
thirty feet deep and a circular stairway
leads to the bottom. After devious wind
ings around the bottom of the well an
immense underground lake was discov
ered, and at the very entrance a canoe,
apparently of" cedar, but petrified and
chained to the wall by a heavy metal sta
ple. The chain was five- feet long, mado
of metal swivels woven together. The
bank of the lake was explored a mile and
a half one way and a little more than that
distance the other, but its extent could
not be determined.
Large Underground Lake.
Forest says he left Chicago a year ago
last February and came West to prospect.
He went to Alaska and also made a thor
ough Investigation of the St. Helens dis
trict, in Lewis County. Last August he
started for the mountains with a. good
outfit, intending to remain there ail win
ter. He believed the great mother lode
of the Pacific slope lay farther north than
St. Helens, and so went to Mount Rainier.
He prospected about the base of the
mountain for some time, and at last
reached a point about 7500 feet above sea
level. The formation was of rough gran
ite covered with a crust of ( lava, which
was hard to penetrate. He at length dis
covered an opening which showed .evi
dences of human handiwork, as It at. one
time evidently had been covered with a
large flat rock.
Forest narrates with much detail his
discovery and subsequent explorations.
He unpacked his horses, on September 4
and sent them down the side of the moun
tain, and from that time until a few
days ago, he says, he has lived in the
cave and conducted his explorations.
The cave Is described as about twelve
feet In height and from eight to fifty or
sixty feet in width. The walls have been
polished and are covered by many hiero
glyphics and figures made by human
hands. The main passage was explored
for a distance of five miles. Passages led
off in many directions from the main
cave. One of these contained boiling
water and in others huge blocks of Ice
were found. In one place there was ,a hot
spring and a sulphur spring, with^a cold
spring between them. Two tubs had been
cut into the stone near these springs.
Sought the Mother Lode.
If his story S<s trueâ and there is as yet
no evidence to contradict it â he has dis
covered a mine of vast wealth and a cave
that will rival the famous Mammoth Cave
of Kentucky. His find will also set the
archaeologists wild with curiosity.
SEATTLE, March 7.â Remarkable In the
extreme â so extraordinary that not all of
those who have heard of it can bring
themselves to regard it seriouslyâ is a tale
of discovery that came from the town of
Chehalis to-day. It is told by II. F. For
est, who claims to be a prospector. He
arrived in Chehalis yesterday and says his
home Is in Chicago. He is an educated
man and declares that he is not trying to
form a stock company or to borrow
money, but intends to wait In Chehalis a
couple of weeks until he can be joined by
his brother, when he expects to return to
the scene of his remarkable find, on the
south side of Mount Rainier.

officer was duly ordered to remove the
Secretary of the Territory. The action of
the legislators created a great sensation
and Is the subject of much comment, opin
ions differing. It is thought by many that
he should have asked permission to oc
cupy a place on- the floor and not have
taken It as a right. On the "other hand,
scme^ofthe Independents hold that the
Secretary had no right to attempt to make

makers were held In the palace, of the an

House of Representatives assembled in
the throne room of the defunct dynasty,
while the Senate occupied makeshift quar
ters In the upper corridor of the' building.
The; upper house is composed of fifteen

On the third day of the session Secre

escorted out by the sergeant at arms.
Acting- under the section of the Territo

took up a place on the floor of the House,
with a stenographer, to secure a record
of the proceedings. On the second day of
the meeting attention was called to his
presence, and Representative Beckley
(Ind.) of Molokal offered a resolution re

"It Is our duty," Insisted Morgan, "to
declare that this treaty is not in the wav

If we hesitate to-day it will be the same
a year hence, and the provisions of that
treaty will be fastened upon us." Â¦
Morgan urged that his resolution be
adopted in order that the President might
understand the position of the Senate" so
thoroughly that he would feel justified In
proceeding along lines looking to the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal while
Congress was In Its long recess.
At the conclusion of Morgan's speech

upon the resolution, on motion of Lodge

eminent were a distinct violation of the
Clayton-Bulwar treaty. It was equally
evident that the United States must aban
don its plighted faith with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica in order that the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty might be fastened perma

like a pall over It, or take such a stand
as will sustain the President in hla "pa
triotic and noble action."
The protocols entered into expressed the
defiance by the President of the Clayton-

provisions. They undertook to place the
Government on the high ground that the

this Government.

LONDON. March 7.â In antldoatlon of
a lively debate and exciting scenes aris
ing from the suspension of the Irish Na
tionalists and Balfour's punishment pro
posals there was a great attendance in the
House of Commons to-day. The visitors*
galleries were filled, many peers and ladles
being among those present. Though no
extra policemen were visible a large force
of police was within reach.
Speaker Gully announced that he had
received a letter -rom Jordan to the ef
fect that he had not defied the author'.tv
of tho chair and on motion of Dillon Jor
dan's name was removed from the list of
suspended members.
Balfour then moved his amendment for
the suspension of recalcitrant members
for the session. In supporting the motion
Balfour said it was necessary to provide
adequate summary punishment for such
physical resistance to the Speaker's or
ders as occurred Tuesday. He trusted thÂ«
House would aeree unanimously to the
amendment. The House ought not to re
main helpless against a member who had
committed such an aggravated crlmo
against the House, an oftenae thÂ« danger
and reality of which had been so pain
fully brought before them.
Disorder is Condemned.
ft Sir Henry Campbcll-Bannerman alluded
to the grossly, disorderly conduct of cer
tain members and s#Jd he had not a word
of excuse to say In their Justification or
palliation, but he suggested a modifica
tion of Balfour's amendment.
Â¦ John Redmond said what had occurred
was an ebullition of fesllng and against
an unjust closure. Ho denied premedita
tion and said the moral responsibility for
what had occurred waÂ« wholly on Bal-'
four, whose proposal was extravagant
and unnecessary. ---"
Lord Hugh Cecil. Conservative, moved
an amendment providing that recalcit
rant members should be Imprisoned. This
was opposed by Balfour, w;ho pointed out
that It would place too much responsibil
ity upon the Government.
Several passionate speeches were made
and the scene was one cf the greatest ex
citement. Finally, having forcd a division
by shouting "aye" when the Speaker put
the question-, the Irish members joined
the. rest of the House in the "no" lobby,
the result being that no one voted for the
amendment of Lord Cecil and <2t> voted
against it. â¢ . '

WASHINGTON. March 7.âSen
ator William P. Frye of Maine
wa3 to-day re-elected unani
mously President pro tem. of
the Senate, to serve during the
pleasure of the Senate. This Is the second
time Senator Frye has been' honored by
his colleagues. Five years ago, on Febru
ary 7, 1S96, the Republicans 'then being in
a minority, he was elected unanimously.
At to-day's session Morgan of Alabama
concluded his speech in support of his res
olution declaring \the abrogation of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty *' between the
XTnited States and Great Britain. His
peroration was pathetic. He had devoted
the best years of his official life, he said,
to advance the construction of the Nica
ragua canal, but now%lie did not expect to
see the work upon the great waterway
begun.
The Senator read that part of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty which relates to the
Nicaragua canal, and also the protocols
of an agreement for the construction of
the canal made between the United States
Government and the Governments of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica. He declared
that It was perfectly clear that the pro
tocols entered into last fall by this Gov-
Swink, the cowboy, notified Sheriff Del
Lewis of the visit of the desperado and
the Sheriff headed a posse, which is now
searching the country, and sent Deputy
Porter McDonald out with a second pof'se,
which is following the desperado's trull
toward the Mexican border. Swlnk says
he recognized Alvord as soon as he rode
up to the ranch. The desperado demand
ed supper, which Swink provided, and
later Alvord and his Yaqui Indian depart
ed, warning Swink not to leave the ranch
or divulge 'any information in regard to
the visit. Sv.lnk remained at the ranch
during the day and in the evening Alvord
and the Indian returned. It is believed
that they went to dig up treasure which
Alvord had buried near Warren's ranch
after the Cochiie hold-up.
The desperadJ said he would remain all
night at the ranch, and after Swlnk had
prepated supper for the two men Alvord
sat before the fire Â£nd told stories about
his experiences in Mexico and how he
evaded the officers in Arizona. The des
perado retired early and during the night
left the ranch. Swink was again warned
to remain In the house and obeyed orders,
knowing that Alvord Is a desperate man
and would shoot him if he attempted to
leave and were caught.
In the morning Swink went to the corral
and discovered that Alvord and his Indian
companion had taken five horses, two of
them pets of the cowboy. He was angered
and determined to avenge the loss, and
starting over the hills for Pearce he noti
fied the cowboys ho met and at Pearce
told the deputy sheriff.
TUCSON. Ariz.. March 7.â Outlaw Burt
Alvord, accompanied by a Yaqui Indian,
came across the border from Mexico a
few days ago and yesterday visited the
Warren ranch, in Sulphur Springs Valley.
There Alvord held up Frank Swlnk, a
cowboy, who was the only person at the
ranch when he arrived. Alvord, since
"Billy" Stiles left him, has been in Mex
ico with Bravo Juan. He is the only
member of the notorious train robber
gang who Is at liberty, and he has suc

MANILA. March 7 âAdditional induce
ments have been made to the Insurgents
to surrender their guns. General MacAr
thur has directed .nil department com
manders to release one prisoner for every
rifle surrendered. An insurgent who sur
renders his gun will be permitted to name
the prisoner to be if leased, provided no
exceptional circumstances require this
man's detention, in which case another
selection will be allowed.
It is rumored in the local press that
the Carman case will be 'referred to
Washington, and that a statement on cer
tain matters concerning the case will be
obtained from Major General Otis.
The Federalists report that as a re-
Bult of the ncgotlaticns with the insur
gent general, Trias, who is in Southern
Luzon. Trias probaLly will soon surrender.

WASHINGTON. March 7.â A large mall
has been received at the War Depart
ment from General MacArthur. It, in
cludes the record of many cases of mur
der, treason and other high crimes and
misdemeanors on the part of the Fili
pinos.
A native named Luchino Almlda was
convicted l>y a military commission of
flagrant violations of the laws of war and
was sentenced to hard labor for twenty
years and! to pay a fine of 20,000 pesos
General MacArthur commuted the sen
tence to deportation to Guam. It appears
from the evidence that Almida was the
principal chief of La Union at the time
of the occupation of that province, hold
ing office for the Insurrectionary junta
In that official capacity he called on the
officer commanding the American forces
and offered his services to aid in the
work of pacification of the province. His
offer was accepted in good faith and he
Â¦was allowed to continue in office.
Treachery of a Filipino.
While thus acting the role of a friend
of the American cause, the presldehte
and those under. him in authority were
with a common and secret understanding
actually administering their offices under
the orders and in the interest of .the in
surrectionary chiefs. Whenever they col
lected lawfully imposed taxes, they also
sought to impose and collect a like or
larger amount of taxes for the benefit of
the insurgent forces, and In some in
stances they diverted the public funds
derived from taxes legitimately collected
to the same treasonable use.
Another case of treachery reported by
General MacArthur is that of Catalino
Landayan, who was convicted by a mill
tary commission of violating: the laws of
war and giving intelligence to the enemy

LONDOX. March 7.â John . MacWilson
Durant told a -story to-night of his alleged
Ostend duel, to a correspondent which Is
somewhat different from what he told
last night. He said:
"The duel came oft all right enough. It
was very irregular, according to French
rules, but was perfectly fair a la Barrlere
âten paces apart, back to back, heels to
gether; at, drop of handkerchief . turn
round and fire. He was hurt. I was not
touched. The only fake was the tele
gram. I knew I might be dead or might
not, so I told my second to send It off at
any rate.
"I love the girl passionately and have
been miserable since I have been away
from her. I have not been able to sleep
for thinking of her. I would marry her
to-morrow. .It is not true that I am
pressed for money or that- 1 am dependent
on my mother. I have never had as much
money to spend In my life before as I
have had lately.
"I cannot tell you the names of the
other parties to the duel, because they are
probably liable for a criminal offense un
der both the Belgian and French law. . I
gave my word that I would keep the affair
secret. I don't know who gave It away,
but when I go back to Paris, as I shall,
I'll twist his neck for the sake of my
family, for her sake and for the sake of
the Russians, all of whom I shall have to
fight in consequence when I go back. But
I'm not afraid to die."
In an interview with another reporter
Durant said his opponent was not gravely
hurt.
"He fell on his back, but we had a
medical man present, and he will not die.
It was a chest wound. I'm going to Amer
ica and then back to Paris, but not for a
couple of months. I can shoot, and I'm
very lucky." ~

The negotiations. Rockhlll says, are go

they should not be completed in two
months, with the exception of the com
mercial treaties, which will probably take
a long time.
General Chaffee replied to the copy of
General Yin Tn'-hang's letter sent him by
Court von Wa'dersee ihat he had given
instructions to the American troop* when
any detachments were sent against rob
bers and boxers to obtain to the lullest
extent possible the assistance of Chiness
officials in making arrests and punishing
the guilty.
Regarding indemnity for losses stiÂ«
tained by missionaries and native Chris

his sentiments were well known to the
American missionariesâ that he was op
posed to extortion In every form and that
he favored strict justice in every case.
and that therefore he would agree quickly
to his Excellency's proposition that the
Indemnities Sir Robert Hart had men
tioned should be settled by the diplomats.

WASHINGTON. March 7.â Since last
autumn the Xavy Department has sus
perdfd the experiments in the employ
ment of wireless telegraphy as a means of
communication between naval vessels and
between vessels and the shore. Up to
this time none of the warships have been
equipped with a permanent plant.
Rear Admiral Bradford, the chief of the
equipmerit bureau, which naturally would
install any such mr-ans of communication.
has bren having conferences with gome
of the mest eminent electricians in the
United States as to the availability of the
Â¦wireless telegraph for naval use. But so
far norhing lik<Â»*the ideal system has been
found. The latest proposition has been
broached by the TVpartment of Agricul
ture. Secretary Wilson, hearing that the
navy -was casting about for a serviceable
system of tMcgraphy. has written to Ad
miral Rradford to notify him that the
Agricultural Dcrartment has been exper
imenting for some lime with wireless
telegraphy and has attained remarkable
results. His experts assert with the
greatest positiveness that they have
evolved a system radlcnllv different from
Marconi's and of far greater efficiency It
is probable that within a short t:rne a
practical ?xhiKition will be made on board
cf a naval vessel.

The Hawaiian Govprnmfiit'a steam tug
Elfu. which Â«u bought from Mr.
BpreokHs about BSS,"4* the occasion of a
ludicrous attitude on the part of the Ter
ritorial Govprnrhent. Before the advent
of the SDrerkels' me fearless^ the Eleu
did all the tow-ing, excepting; for an occa
sional enlistment of the inter-Island steam
t-tders. When the Council of State un
der the republic *a$ passing emergency
nrproprlatinns, pending the coming Into
effect of Teprltnrial Government, the
tjueFtion was raised In that body as to
whether the tug should be maintained, as
there van ft belief that under American
lati the Government co*jld not enpage in
the towfns business. AJt all events, pro
vision was made for Jceeptne: up the ves
ppI. It being represented that the boat
might be needed for other service, such as
irat cf the Board of Health. She has
been towing parbage to pea. latterly, but
Et ihe nine time making many comical
efforts to compete with the swift and
powerful Fearless.
A few days ago it was up against the
Orverr.ment to have the tug Inspected by
T'ncle Sam's inspector* of hulls and boil
er*. Then the Superintendent of Public
Works performed a tactical stroke which
prrved effective. Making the plea that
the tug had passed with other public prop
erty into the possesFion of the Federal
Government, he induced the Inspectors to
waive inspection of the craft. This put
the tujf urton the distinguished plane of
being a ship of the United States navy. A'
test of her distinction in this respect came

HAVANA. March 7.â The constitutional
convention met in secret session this af
ternoon for a forma! discussion of the
Platt amendment. The conservative ele
ment scored a victory. It was decided tc
continue the sessions of the convention
and to refer the amendment to the special
committee on relations with Instructions
to bring In a. report.
General SangulHy favored dissolving th-Â»
convention and returning the amendment
without discussion. The other delegate*
ware unanimously In favor of continuing
the session and of sending some answer
to the executive department in Washing
ton.
It Is generally believed that the crisis,
if any existed, has passed, and by the
time the committee reports the present
excitement will have died out. Much de
pends upon the attitude of the radical
delegates. If an impassioned appeal to thÂ»Â»
people is issued, as Is rumored will be the
case, this will cause demonstrations of
protest against the United States. But
nothing in the nature of an uprising: is
any longer feared.

MEXTO, March 7.â The Senators who op
posed the ratification of the China Basin
lease on the presumption, that the South
ern Pacific Company secretly desired a
denial of the lease reckoned without au
thentic Information, and ' their conduct
may compel the law department of the
company to make an explanation. It
transpires that President Ripley of the
Santa Fe recently met President Hays of
the Southern Pacific and submitted a
statetnent that members of the Legisla
ture had received a hint from the law do
partment of the latter corporation that
the lease ought to be opposed. President
Hays asserted in the most explicit man
ner that the company which he repre
sented was not fighting the Santa Fe in
the California Legislature, and that no
authority had been given to any officer
of the Southern Pacific to concern himself
in the legislation relative to the lease
President Hays said rurther that he
would immediately inquire if instructions
had been given from any department to
oppose the Santa Fe, and if the inquiry
should establish the fact of such inter
ference the officer responsible for it would
be called to strict reckoning. President
Ripley of the Santa Fe was earnestly re
quested to present all the facta to the
Southern Pacific, and the wires wer*
promptly used In compliance with the re
quest. * . - â¢ ,.; r - :Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-

the Assembly th!s afternoon by a vote of 46
ayes to 21 noes. Sutro changed his vote
from no to aye and gave notice that he
would move to reconsider.
The Senate Finance Committee, to
which was referred the concurrent resolu
tion providing for an adjournment on
March 9. had the matter under discussion
this evening and changed the date to
Saturday, March 16, at 12 midnight. The
change was made only after considerable
debate.
What is known as the "Nosier bill"

setback in the Assembly to-night. By pro
test of -seven members- Johnson. Ralston.

Francisco and Chilesâ its consideration on
the special urgency file was denied, and it
was returned to its place on the second
reading file. The end of the session prob
ably will be reached before it comes up on
final passage. The bill is In the form of
an act authorizing and providing the
means for the collection of the "war
claims" of the State, amounting to $4 000
000, out of which J800.000 would go to
Thomas M. Nosier, according to the pro

claims.

Error in Slot Machine Bill. y
When the slot machine bill came up in
the Senate this afternoon Oneal asked
that it be passed on file, but the Senate
was not going to lei it go Â»o easily. Bel
fhaw got up and objected, "unless," he
Kaid, "some good reason be given why
the bill should go over."
It already had been passed once and to
ra.Â»s it again would be to send it to the
foot of the file, an<l to this also Belshaw
objected. The objection caused much
consternation among the opponents of the
measure. Oneal tn*d to give a reason by
ravins that there probably would be a
exeat deal of dis-cusslon over the measure
and it would block other bills below it
en the file. Belshaw taw no rorce in this
reason and Davis declared that the bill
â¢vvas entitled to consiot-ration in its place
en the file and saw no reason against dis
cussing it at once, particularly as the
request cair.e from one who was not
"handling" the measure in the Senate.
Wolf*- wanted to know why then it was
that Davis, who was uqt the author, ob

bv Johnson to prc33 the bill to a vote
sÂ« soon as possible. He called attention

sideration after nearly an hour;
of rustling about on a call of the Hou?-> j
to g-et the necessary lorty-one votes. The j
fiz-.p.l vote stood â ayes H. noes 15.
Martin Kelly, Brady. Franklin and oth
f.s immediately interested In the bill are
jubilant. They hope the fear that the bi:l j
will pars the Senate will cause the tele- j
phor.e company to send a "sack" to Sac- j
ramento and that they will be the benen â¢ |
claries. Up to the present the telephone
company has stubbornly refused to t>5
"touched." taklr.g the stand that the bill.
on account of its orig'.n, was obviously a
cinch measure, and it did not believe the
Legislature would enact a law from sucn j
â¢curce. Whether or not the company will j
maintain that stand, now that one branch |
of the Legislature has passed the bill, re
xnair.s to be scâ¬n.
A number of Assemblymen who believed
the provisions of the bill to be good in
the main voted against the measure,
knowing that Brady -was not the autho.- â¢
of it and that it m introduced for
"cinch" purposes only. Martin Kelly *
connection with it is veri- well known and
the bill was passed because many Assem
blymen believed it was a good bill and
could be forced through the Senate
though they distrusted Lue good faith of
Â¦ the men behindJt.
The bill compels telephone companies
doing other than an interstate business to
â¢secure from the Secretary of State certi
iieates of authority fÂ» tiansact such busi
ness. They must keep pioper books of ac
oount. subject to the inspection of the |
Controller or Secretary of State, and
f hall pay to the Contrr.ller of the State 2
t>er cent of the gross receipts of their
business.
A long debate preceded the roll call.
Kelley spoke for the bill, as did Henry
and Hourigan. Brown of San Mateo.
I^aird. Hanen, Feliz and Guilfoyle spoke
against It.
Hourigan appealed a? a laboring man
to all those who "loved labor" to vote for
the bill, but when McLaughlfn a?ked him
If It was not tiue that the San Francisco
Typographical Union, the Building Trades
Council and ether labor organizations
were united in opposition to the bill.
Hourigan said he refused to recognize any
particular, class or organization, but
would vote for the Interests of all the
people. Guilfoyle told the Assembly plain-
Leavitt's Senate bill 56, providing for the
appointment of the State Printer instead
of his election by the people, was passed
by the Assembly this afternoon by a vote
of 44 to 22. Guilfoyle changed his vote
from no to aye* and gave notice of a mo
tion to reconsider.
By consent of both sides Senate bill 539,
providing a cfintinuous appropriation for
the University of California, .was amend
ed in the Assembly to-day in a manner
that very materially changes its import.
As originally drawn the bill in effect ap
propriated $1,000,000. payable in five bien
nial installments. Unless future Legisla
tures should repeal the act the item rtt
$200,000 had to be provided for in the tax
levy and inserted as an item In the gen
eral appropriation bill. As amended. In
accordance with the objections 'offered by
Fisk, the bill amounts to a resolution de
claring the State's policy to be to appro
priate $200,000 biennially. In addition to all
other revenues of the university. Sections
3. 4 and 5 of the original bill are stricken
out.
University Bill Amended.
The caucus amendmc-nts to the Senate
apportionment bill were adopted in the
Assembly this morning and the bill was
ordered to engrossment and third reading.
The bill will be promptly passed by the
Assembly, but in the Senate a bitter con
test will be made against concurrence.
The committee primary election bill
(Assembly Bill 793) and 3Iacbeth's bill
<109), relating to conventions, -were passed
by the Assembly ihi3 morning without
debate. The former bill, as amended,
probably will meet strong opposition in
the Senate. It embodies Johnson"s test
of party affiliation, brised on adherence
to the principles enunciated in the most
recent party platform oi by other high
est authority, as against the test pro
posed by the joint elections committee â
a declaration of intention to support thÂ«s
nominees of the party.
Primary Bill Passes.
On or after six months aftÂ«r the entry
of thÂ»Â» decree, unless it shall have been
reversed on appeal or a new trial shall
have been granted, the court shall mak*

L The existence of the fact of the marriage
and of a ground for divorce, and the non
existence of any cause for denying the same.
2. The portions of the property, community

Upon the hearing of the evidence in a
divorce suit. If the court finds that a
ground for divorce exists, it shall make

it may be presumed. v1ll be signed by the
Governor, the prohibition of marriafe of
divorced persons witnin a year after di
vorce is removed and instead a scheme is
adopted which will prevent marriage for
six months. This scheme is such that il
cannot be evaded by Reno marriages.
This end is gained by ueans of interlocu
tory decrees.

divorce bill (Assembly bill 531). The
amended bill will be returned to the Sen
ate and thence will ro to the Governor.

The total printing appropriation, whicn
was Â«125,000 and left a deficit, was cut by
the bill to 557,000 and was raised by the
committee to $125.0u0. The total appro
priation for agricultural fairs was raised
from $S0.'><0 to J1OJ.000 by Increasing each
individual appropriation by 25 per cent.
The appropriation of $60,000 for the State

Linville haa set the police on the track

of Washington. Linville was greatly con
cerned in the fate of the boy and is happy
now that he has him safely within his
custody again. He will return with the
boy to Lodi to-morrow.
Tiie story Linville tells is a remarkable
one. He detailed the manner of. his pur
suit, aided by police and detectives, and
how McCrea each time eluded him. While
the couple were on the train from Seattle
to Tacoma, McCrea got a hint that he was
being pursued and dropped off at a way
station, , leaving Mrs. Linville and the
child on the train. Mrs. I^inville told the
conductor she had been led away from her
home by McCrea under threats to kill her
if she did not obey him and she begged
the conductor to rescue her. The con
ductor told her to stay on the train until
the return trip should have been com
pleted and she did so. '
It was then that Linville met his wife
and child. Linville says she told him
McCrea had visited her home at Lodi
while he was at work in the mines and
at the point of a pistol commanded her to
follow him with her child. Once they were
away from Lodi. he took from hla valise
a rcpe and said â¢ that if she resisted he
would kill her and the boy and hang hint
self with the rope. She told her husband
that she - tried to escape from McCrea's
clutches, but could not. The husband be
lieved the story, which he afterward
learned the woman had told also to the
conductor who aided her and he then
brought his wife to her sister's home at
Aberdeen, there to let her remain until
she recovers from her thrilling experi
ence.

Talent at Oakland Bet Heavily on Bangor and He Again
Sulked---Flora Pomona Outfooted by. Waterscratch in
Track Record Time â Dominick Rides in Splendid Form
By F. E. Mulholland.
SO accustomed have the crowds at
Oakland become to backing any
and every horse that Bullman
rides that were Johnny to strad
dle a lop-eared government mule
in far away Manila he would be heavily
played to win the Filipino Derby. At
Oakland yesterday the crack rider was
posted to pilot Bangor in the mile and
seventy yards selling run, for the first
time since the notorious rogue became
the property of Burns & Waterhouse. Al
though there was nothing rise to justify
it. the 7 to 5 laid was snapped up as
eagerly as a mountain trout snaps at a
brown hackle f y. Away well at the start.
Bullman whistled in the chestnut horse's
iar. told him what easy game he was up
agair.st. then "fanned" him with a new $6
whip. It was justr like a tramp looking
for hard work, "there wns nothing do
ing." Bangor has apparently set his mind
against the game, and finished in fifth po
sition. In a iong. hard drive Dominick
rut the 9 to 2 chance El Mido over the
plate lirst. half a length in advance of the
rank outsider Spike. Opponent, primed
:md ready for Â« bruising race, was badly
messed about by little Meany. never hav
ing a chance to show what he could do.
The Ftsiking feature of the sport was
I he riding of ihe St. Louis boy, Dom
ini'-k. who after finishing second In the
nper.ing number captured the last three
races on the card. Four smart choices
were bowled over in St. Rica. Flora Po
mona. Bangor nnd Dollie Welthoff. The
attendance and betting was quite as good
as on the preceding day.
Had Pat Morrissey. the 3 to 5 favorite,
stopped U; catch his breath during the
progress of the mile run. first decided, he
would have been beaten. As it -was Bull
man landed him winner by a nose over
Don Luis, a 10 to 1 shot. Florabird ran
third.
Even if Owen Mounce on St. Rica had
been quicker away from the post in the
scramble next decided It is doubtful
whether the favorite could have downed
Jingle Jingle. The brown mare, with
Ransch on her hack, possessed most of
her old-time speed, winning from start to
tinish. Pilot, \ despised outsider, led St.
Rica out for the place. The latter horse
came fast through the j-tretch. but the
ground lost at the start could not be re
covered.
All of the handk-appers and ready reck
oners spread the coin about good and
thick on Flora Pomona to tnkeÂ»the three
and one-half furlong dash for two-year
olds. While the filly ran a very tidy look
ing race she was unable to overhaul
Mounce on Watersoratch. which scored
by :Â» half-length. The half-brother to old
Braw Scot equaled the track record for
the distance of 41Vi seconds. Jack Tyr
rell, second choice in the ring, lost the
show to Monastic.
Mike Strauss, at odd.s of 6 to 3. led all
the way in the <xtra seven-furlong selling
affair. Dr. Maiks. a r.0 to 1 shot, finished
second a head in front of Young Morello.
Jollying J. Ransch on the favorite. Dol
lie Weithoff. into thinking that he had
the last race up his sleeve. Dominick.
astride St. Wood, outfinlshed "Jay" the
last few yards, getting home first by a
neck. The winner was a 7 to 1 chance in
the books. living Cup received substan
tial backing at short odds, but the weight
carried told neir the end. and third was
as close up as the mare could get.
Track Notes.

ed to have died at Oakland Tuesday* night.

SY LOUIS HONIG.
AT TANFORAN TRACK
rÂ«Â»*>y IGHT from the north came the
I )# yesterday, and it tore
L-^' through the Tanforan inclosure
JX*^^ and up the stretch to the preat
discomfort of horses, jockeys
and patrons of the game. It may have
been this wind that added so many sec
onds to the time in the fourth race, the
one and one-sixteenth mile event, and it
may not have been the wind at all. What
the spectators 'houpht when they saw the
four fast footers snail themselves along
the backstretcli was that the race was
very badly ridden. The track was fast,
which is more than can be said for the
track performers.
In this handicap race for three-year-olds
and over Formero. Florizar. Advance
Guard and Autumn went to the post. Ad
vance Guard, with O'Connor up. was a 3
to 5 favorite and received the bulk of the
play, although Florizar. piloted by Burns,
came In for quite a bit of backing. No
pace was set at the start and the race,
was inexplicably slow. Miller took
Formero. 12 to 1, to the front 80911 after
the Ftart. Burns on Florizar keeping in
close touch, whiie O'Connor lay back with
Advance Guar.l. There seemed *o be no
difficulty for Formero to head the Held
over the entire route. At the stretch Ad
vance Guard passed Autumn, hut O'Con
nor couldn't move beyond this position.
Formero won right easily. Advance Guard
and Florizar having the flgHt at the wire
for place and show. Florizar held to his
oripinal position, and all the great Ad
vancf Guard, with top weight, could get
was the show In a four-horse race.
Dangfrnus Maid, at 15 to 1, acted the
part which the name indicates in the third
race, over six and a half furlongs. Handi
capper. with O Connor in the saddle, was
the third choice, while the talent fell upon
Isaline. steered by Tommy Burns, for the
prime selection. At the quarter post Wed
derstrand took thÂ«* Dangerous Maid to
the for*\ and Kitty Kelly, coming from
the back, tried some team work until the
three-quarter post. Handicapper hove in
sight at the stretch, and then began the
hard sailing for port. Dangerous Maid
passed under tlie. wire a neck in advance
of Handicapper. Isallne beat Kitty Kelly
out for the Khow.
The third long shot winner was Dr.
Cave, 7 to 1. This happened in the last
race, in which Catastrophe, ridden by
O'Connor and made a 9 to 10 favorite,
could not overtake the lead which Thorpe
on Dr. Cave assumed at the outset.
O'Connor started out to win the series,
but he lasted only for the first two games.
Mounted on Gonfalon, an 8 to 5 favorite,
over a good firld in the first race O'Con
nor, fourth at the stretch, passed Specific
and Kdinboroupb and took the money.
Sad Sam was wretchedly ridden. Then
came O'Connor's second winning, this
time on Wyoming, which was done In
faFy style. Owensboro and Phoenician
fiKhting for the place.
Charley Thorpe had th*Â» extreme pleas
ure and gratification to find himself win
ner on two occasions. Saddled to Artena
Thorpe rode home, in glaring fashion in
the fifth race. Quibo, 20 to 1. got the
rlare. Then came the Dr. Cave race,
which made Thorpe's second victory.
Presiding Judge Pettinglll called the
jockeys up after the second race and read
them a lesson on the evils of bumping.
The jockeys looked weepy for a time, but
It can hnrdly be said that their subse
quent actions marked a deep penitence.

CHINESE THICK OF *,
SUBSTITUTION PLAYED
PLANS for a splendid apartment
house, to be known as th-3
Drexel, to be erected on the north
west corner of a 50-vara lot locat
ed but a short distance from the
Olympic Club, have been accented and
construction will begin in "the near future.
A number of local capitalists have formed
a corporation for the purpose of erecting
the building.
The plans accepted are those of New
som Newsom & Newsom. The Drexe!
will be the best arranged apartment
house on this coast. In New York and
other large Eastern cities the apartment
house system has always been popular,
as it combines the maximum of comfort.
The Drexel will be 137:6 by 137:6 feet in
exterior dimensions und six or possibly
eight stories in height. With six stories
there will be seventy separate suites of
from four to five rooms each. The who'e
building will be fireproof and every apart
ment will have the benefit of sunlight.
The main staircase win be of sculptured
marble and the halls will be paved In
mosaic and wainscoted in marble, with
grained ceilings. Two electric elevators
will convey residents to their several
floors. The apartments will be models of
luxury, finished in native woods and ar-
convenience and luxury with the mini
mum of expense. The famous Strathmor*
of New York was the first built in this
country and one with twenty-four stones
is now being erected in the same city.

tion, be fixed at tl and that the senerai
admission be fixed at &â¢ cents. A commit
tee was appointed to wait upon the mem
bers of the Board of Kducation and ask
that a half holiday be granted school chil
dren. A circular letter will also be sent' to
business houses asking the proprietors to
allow their employes off at noontime in
order that they may bo able to attend tho
afternoon performance and evening ex â¢
erclsea.
The first story will be of dressed stone
and the superstructure of buff brick ard
terra cotta. Provision is made for a druÂ»r
store on the first floor. The usual tele
phonic, electrical and water convenience 1 ?
will be Introduced. Bay-windows will
adorn the front of each suite. The styiÂ«
of architecture is French renaissance.
The approximate cost of the improvement
is J300.000.

tiled floors and be furnished with gas
ranges and every imaginable device to se

DENVER, March 7.â The organization
of the American Cattle Growers' Associa
tion was completed to-day. The constitu
tion a? adopted permits men engaged in
raising both cattle and sheep to become
members provided cattle raising is their
paramount Industry. Denver was made
the headquarters for the association.
The basis of representation is by indi
vidual membership, in nerson or by proxy.
Each member pays an initiation fee of $5.
There may also be levied a tax of one
cent a head on all, cattle owned by each
member of the association. Officers were
elected to-day as follows: President, F.
C. Lusk, California; first vice president,
F. C. Goudy, Colorado: second vice presi
dent, M. K. Parsons, Utah; treasurer, F.
A. Keener, Colorado. H. H. Robinson of
Colorado was elected member-at-large of
the executive committee in recognition of
his services in organizing the association.
The secretary will be chosen by the ex
ecutive committee.
The resolutions proposed by Colonel
John P. Irish of California advocating the
leasing of the public ranges by the Govern
ment were adopted after a prolonged dis
cussion, about three-fourths of the dele
gatos voting for them. Resolutions were
adopted opposing the Grout" oleomarga
rine bill. and approving the action of the
Bureau of Animal Industry in furnishing
vaccine to stockmen. The following reso
lution, offered by Paul McCormick of Ne
braska, was unanimously adopted:
Whereas. In some unfortunate manner the
Uea has been promulgated that the members
of this asbociutlon are antagonistic to the Na
tional Livestock Association and that the
American Cattle Growers was organized
largely for the purpose of drawing sup
port from the National Association; and
whereas, a number of the members of this
association are members of the National As
sociation and some of the officers of this as
rociatlon are also officers of the Xatlonrfl As
sociation and are serving in both organisa
tions, believing that both are occupying sepa
rate and distinct fields of usefulness in the
livestock world: and whereas, the National
Livestock Association has recently secured a
sreat victory In the defeat of the iniquitous
Grout bill, which. If it had become a law.
Â¦would have denrived the cattlemen - of this
country of over $20,000,000 every year; and
v.hereas, it is the intention of this association
t> uphold the Rood work being done by the
National Association and all reports to the
c< ntrary. are unfounded and not based upon
the facts. Therefore,
Resolved. That the members of the American
Cattle Growers' Association, in convention as
sembled, extend greetings to the National Live
stock Association and our congratulations to
the officers of said association in their sUp
cess In defeating the Grout bill, and the ex
ecutive committee of this association Is In
structed that if, in its judgment, it is prac
ticable for this association to be enrolled as
a member of the National Livestock Associa
tion the committee be and is hereby authorized
ti take the necessary action to accomplish this
result.
The convention adjourned sine die this
afternoon.

shout. "Allah. Allah. Kismet. Kismet."
p.n<1 when th<"- steamship was lost to view
a quiet prayer was breathed by many at
tb" -lo^k that the happy band of pilgrims
mieht have a pleasant voyage and safe
return to thÂ»Â»ir fnis In this broad land.
Long before the hour set for the depart
ure of .the Sierra the hosts of friends of
the Shrincrs gathered on the ship to bid
farewell to the departing pilgrims. Th-j
bf-autiful raioon of ih~ Sierra was a veri
table bower of roses and the overflow of
floral gifts was plaeei in the staterooms
Of the sons of Sala<Un.
"Kismet. Kismet." shouted the pilgrims
as they bid farewell to their friends of
th* Golden State, and huge bumpers of
â¢"rim-zim" were quaffed. â¢â¢Kfsmet, Kis
met." shouted the daughters of California
who had journeyed to th* water front to
bid pood-by to the departing caravan.
Supreme Potentate Lou B. Winsor led
his followers in the farewell salutations
and did himself "proud." Even the
"camel" was moved to tears when the
potentate mistook a policeman for a
"brother"! ami cave him the sign of "over
ihp hot sands."
The peculiar sounds were simply an ac
companiment to the departure of th*e band
of Mystic Shriners to the Paradise of the
Pacific to establish aii "oasis" in thd
xnldst of the deep bluÂ« sea.
'"Kismet," "Allah be praised," "Bismil
lah," were Fome of the exclamations
heard at the Oceanic ilock and at regular
intervals one could hoar a peculiar "pop,
pop," which seemed as if corks were be
ing ejected from bottles containing liquid*
charged with a gas at high pressure.
Strange Founds wen? heard last evening
In flie vicinity tf the steamship Sierra
for an hour previous to her departure for
Honolulu ami the Antipodes.
Steamship Sierra Sails for the An
tipodes With the Largest Pas
senger List Ever Known
at This Port.
Crowds of Friends Bid Fare
well to Shriners at
Oceanic Dock.

fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long been
considrred th*> next thir.p to incurable.

maTion of pases, causinc pressure on the |
heart and lungs and difficult breathing. 1
heada'-hrs. ?'ckl<? app^t!t<>. nervousness
and a cer.<?ral playod out. languid feeling. I
Th^re is Â«->ften a foul taste in the mouth, j
coatM tongi:' 1 and if thÂ«Â» interior of the ]
etoTTiach cou'.d be t-ren it would show a
filmy, inflamed condition.
ThÂ» cure for this common and obstinate
Â¦trouble is found in a. treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment and
Irritate the delicate mucous surfaces of
the stomach. To secure a prompt and
healthy dicestioa IÂ« the one necessary
thing- to do and when normal digestion is
f^curf-d the catarrhal condition will have
disappeared.
According: to Dr. Harlanson the safest
pnd be^t treatment is to use after each
rr.'-al a Uiblr>t, composed of Diastase.
Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux. Golden Seal

Vie found at all drug stores under the
name ot Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and
x~.ot r^inpr a patent medicine, cati be used

Mr. N. J. Booher. Chicapo. HI., writes:
"Catarrh i? a locÂ«l condition resulting-
from a negjoctr-d cold in the head, where-
by the lining membrane vt the nose be-
C'i:nes inflamed and the poisonous dis-

<J'.:ci:i^ oatarrh of the stomach. Medical
authorities prescribed for me for three

riir<\ but to-day I am the happiest of men
nf;Â»r usinff one box of Stuart's
Pytpgprta Tablets. I cannot Iind appro-
pri-.jte words to express my good feeling.

EROTIC INSANITY.
WITHIN a few months thirty-five women have
been brutally butchered by men in this coun
try.
In each case the slayer professed to be in love with
the slain and killed her because the feeling was not
reciprocated. In some cases the girl had made known
to her parents that threats had been made against her
life and the man had been bound over to keep the
peace. But his bond was no restraint and he killed
her.
This erotic insanity is the most dangerous form cf
homicidal mania. >It is treated lightly by the law or
not at all. It generally appears in persons of evil
temper and uncontrolled passions, who are not de
sirable company for any self-respecting woman. It
is becoming, too common, and in default of legal pro
tection should be dealt with sternly by the male pro
tectors of women.
When these erotics are arrested for making threats
their offense, is treated all too lightly. Often the mat
ter is regarded as a joke.
Any man, who forces his disagreeable attentions
upon a woman should be isolated and held either in a
prison or an asylum. In 99 per cent of such cases the
unreciprocated infatuation ends in murder. Women
are entitled to the most complete protection against
such brutes. If the law will not furnish it there is no
other way than to kill the man who wooes a woman
by threat" of murder. If she have a male protector he
should save her life, for she is doomed unless he act
If a woman yield to the threats of such a man and
marry him to save her life she makes for herself a
lifetime of misery, for such men are perverts, degen
erates or psychopaths unfit for the conjugal associa
tion.
We do not wish to be misunderstood in these com
ments. We only say that it is the duty of a father to
save the life of his daughter, or of a brother to save
his sister.. If he arrive on the scene when such an
erotic beast is executing his threat it is hi^ duty ta
kill the wretch, and the law holds him blameless. In
view of the" fact that such threats to kill are inva
riably carried out, why is it not the.duty of a father
or brother to act in advance of the opportunity which
the erotic assassin is ceeking? '

A nugget weighing 1130 ounces was
found recently In the Ural gold mines at
Orsk, in the Government of Orenberg.
Among them were found women who had entered
the camps to visit relatives and were forbidden to de
part. One of these had carried with her a baby boy, that
had been kept and had nearly grown to manhood as a
convict. The mother had been repeatedly whipped by
the overseer to compel her to render uncompensated
service. The story of wrongs endured by her and
other innocent persons held in slavery as criminals
caused a passing sensation. There is no evidence that
the State took any steps to right the wrongs or pun
ish the wrongdoers. In a normal state of society,
where men are mindful of human rights, such a
hideous condition of things would have roused the
deepest indignation, and for the honor of the com
monwealth the sternest measures would have been
taken. But there is no evidence that anything was
done. The sufferers were negroes, and the difference
in race and color marked the difference in treat
ment of a matter that would have stirred the State
to its depths had they been whites.
It was revealed that the system of farming out con.
victs to work mines and plantations in the South had
led to other abuses scarcely less heinous. To replen
ish or increase the supply of such labor negroes are
arrested and convicted upon the most trifling pretext.
What elsewhere, or when committed by whites, are
I treated as misdemeanors receive the punishment of
felonies in. the case of negroes, and those unfortu
nate people have no assurance that their detention will
tease with the expiration of their sentences, as they
are liable to be held indefinitely by force. Tnere has
been recently exposed a worse condition of affairs in
South Carolina than in Georgia. The convict campf.
on the plantations are full of innocent negroes, who
were never accused of any crime, never had a trial,
were never convicted of anything, but are held in vir
tual slavery- They are captives as much as any of
â¢their race were on the African slave coast in the palny
days of the slave trade. '.
The exposure of this crime against the. rights o!
humanity came through a planter brutally killing, one
of these innocent men who tried to escape from
bondage. Upon examination of the matter it was dis
covered that the murdered negro was a captive slave
and not a convict criminal. Then followed other reve
lations of which the Grand Jury has been compelled to
take cognizance.
It is proved that in South Carolina has grown up
a system of labor contracts with the negroes and that
these contracts are made assignable. A planter in am
county, makes a number of these contracts, and when
work is slack he. sells the contracts to another, per
haps a considerable distance away, and unless the con
tract negroes. go, away to their new master they are
arrested and charged with breach of contract, which
is treated as a feiony. Of course conviction follows,
and the unfortunate negroes are sentenced to the con
vict camps.
In no other civilized state on earth is the violation
THE SOUTH CAROLINA WAY.
LAST year the discovery was made that a large
number of negroes were held in the convict
camps in Georgia and worked under the lash
who had never been convicted of, any crime nor sen
tenced by any court. They had been lured into the
camps and thereafter detained by force.

To what extent will Supervisor Tobin hold himself
responsible for the results that are sure to follow the
resumption of gambling at Ingleside? To what ex
tent can he be responsible? What is his responsibility
worth to the community? â¢
Can he or his friends prevent men and women from
gambling away at the track the money they require
for the maintenance of an honest life? Can any law
or watchfulness prevent the heavy^osers from robbing
their employers, or perhaps plying the trade of a high
way robber, for the sake of getting money to retrieve
their losses? Can it stay the hand of the desponding
wretches when even crime itself holds out no hope to
their maddened brains and they set about suicide?
The responsibility for the ruin wrought by track
gambling does indeed rest upon the officials who
grant the gambling privileges and thus legalize tht
curse, but that responsibility is of no use to the com
munity. It does not repay the stolen money, it does
not bring back lost honor, nor save from prison or
suicide the victims of the wrong.
Somewhere in New York there are officials who are
responsible for the ruin of Conlin, but they will not
appear in court to help him, neither will they assist ,
the family he abandoned. Their responsibility does
not go that far. We shall see the same play repeated
here. Supervisor Tobin was bold in proclaiming his
â¢csponsibiliiy before the Supervisors, but when the
results of gambling at Ingleside begin to show them
selver in the prisons and at the Morgue the "respon
sible" Supervisor will dodge the consequences.
The Buffalo Exposition may be regarded as an as
sured success, for the Government has authorized the
issue of a Pan-American postage stamp, for the 'occa
sion.
This century did not sec the beginning of the Chi
nese imbroglio, and from the way things are going
with the concert of powers it has very dim prospects
German statesmen are nothing if not original in
expression. Some of them believe that their policy
has been a mistake in China. The rest of us believe
it to have been wholesale, wanton murder.
When the gambling ordinance was before the Su
pervisors, after representatives of the better elements
of the people had protested against it in the name of
morality and humanity and had pointed out the many
fearful crimes that resulted from gambling in the
past, Supervisor Tobin said: "I assume the entire re
sponsibility for it. and I shall not shirk it now or
hereafter. I alone am responsible for the introduc
tion of the bill." (
This story of wrong and ruin which, beginning on
the other side of the continent, has had its culmination
here is another illustration of the evil results of race
track gambling in whatever form such gambling is
permitted. In this city there have been many parallel
cases. We have had in the annals of our criminal
courts and in the records of the Morgue so many
similar instances of moral ruin that we did not need
this story from the East to teach us the results of race
tracks that are maintained not for honest races but
for the profits that are obtained from gambling. Yet
in the face of those lessons the Supervisors have de
cided to permit gambling at Ingleside, and the Mayor,
after describing the .scheme as a privilege of "pocket
picking." sanctioned the permit.
ANOTHER RACETRACK WRECK
PERTINENT to the revival 01 racetracK gam
bling at Ingleside track in this city is the case
of Joseph A. Conlin, the young man from New
York who was arrested here last Tuesday upon a
charge of embezzlement from the New York post
office. Conlin frankly declares his fall to be due to
betting on the races. His losses were heavy, and in
his efforts to make up the loss he robbed the mails.
That, ho.vever, is not his only offense. While fre
quenting the racetrack he met a young woman who
like himself was going the pace, and when he fled

SUCH good citizens as voted for the election of
the notorious "Eddie" Wolfe to the State Sen
ate solely because he obtained through the
bosses the nomination of the Republican party have
now an opportunity to study the result of their ac
tion. .In the debate on the China Basin bill Senator
Wolfe showed not only his temper but his character.
He revealed the estimate which he puts upon ths
business men of this city, and in doing so made clear
to all the folly of any business man who 'voted for
him against the protests of so many of the ablest Re
publicans in his district.
No one thought it worth. while to take a verbatim
report of Wolfe's speech, but all reports agree that
iik opposing the China Basin lease he denounced tha
character of the business men who signed petitions
requesting the passage of the measure.
When the advocates of the lease pointed out that it
is supported by representatives of the commercial and
manufacturing interests of the city, and that these en
terprising and sagacious men regard the lease as bene
ficial to the public welfare, Wolfe declared that none
of the business organizations of the people really rep
resent the public or have any due regard for the gen
eral gdod. He is quoted as saying:. ''These organi
zations do not represent the people of San Francisco.
They do-Jiot favor anything except what will benefit
their own pockets. One or two "or three of them get
together and decide that they want the Supervisors
or the Legislature to do something or other, and then
they send in their petitions or dispatch their repre
sentatives to ask for it. That is the way they work.
Take the Merchants' Association, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Board of Trade, Pacific Commercial
Museum and all the lest of them, and you will find
them looking out for their own interests every time.
The Merchants' Association has resolved upon every
question excepting those affecting the interests of the
people." â¢ _J
The various organizations thus attacked by name
need no defense from The Call nor any other source.
Neither do they need to defend themselves by reply
ing to the attack. Their deeds speak for them, and the
work which in one way or another they have accom
plished for the promotion of the great interests of the
city and the State and the welfare of all citizens is
fairly well known, j So well known, at least, that no
intelligent man will give . any further attention to
Wolfe's attack than is necessary to mentally register
judgment as to the sort of man Senator Wolfe is.
So long as unscrupulous bosses are enabled to
dominate primaries by force or to vitiate them by
frauds, so long will such men as Wolfe manage to get
nominations for office; and so long as good citizens
believe .they must blindly vote the party ticket, no
matter who may be the nominee, such men will be
elected. A good primary law will rid the California
Legislature of such men \s Wolfe. That is the chief
reason why a primary law should be enacted.
It is an old saying, "The curses of bad men are
better than their blessings." Wolfe could not have,
served Hhe State better than by making that attack
upon the great commercial and industrial organiza
tions. It shows the evil results of electing such men
to office, and thus will be a potent help in ridding
State 'politics not only of Wolfe himself but of all
others of his class.

These straw bonnets were worn in winter

later, when many Americans awoke tp
the simultaneous consciousness that the
costly and intricate straw bonnets made
of the beautiful Italian braids could be
successfully imitated at home. Hand

When the truth is known about the practices in
Mississippi and Alabama they will be found as ne
farious as those of South Carolina. It may soon be
proper to begin running the underground railroad
again to rescue innocent men from this slavery of the
convict camps.
It is 'a violation of every constitutional right of
free men, and is a stain upon the State and section
where the practice prevails. The existence of such a
system is a commentary upon the professions of Sena
tor Tillman, who assumes to teach the North its duty
to its laboring population.

CHINA BASIN LEASE
There are now good reasons for t believing the
Southern Pacific is going out of politics. The Santa
Fe system has never been in politics. We are to have
two great transcontinental lines whose energies will
be devoted solely to the task of providing transporta
tion for the commerce that goes on between this coast
and the rest of the continent." It is therefore to our
advantage to co-operate with the new movement, to
give the roads every opportunity to increase their
terminal facilities so that the city and the State can
do business to better advantage. The China Basin
lease has been drawn up in the interests of the people.
It means a benefit to San Francisco and to Califor
nia. It has been passed by the Senate, and the As
sembly should now promptly follow the example set
by the upper house.
also sought to dominate the politics, of the State, of
the counties and of every important city; and in its
ambition did not hesitate to resort to every form of
corruption and intimidation which cunning men
could devise and brutal bosses put into practice. The
fight against the Southern Pacific was therefore "a
fght in self-defense. It was imperative and unavoid
able.
Such being the facts of the case the opposition
made to the measure was peculiar, and Senator Smith
of Kern was justified in saying: "I am amazed at the
attitude of the San Francisco delegation. With every
business interest in that great city pleading with us
to let this railroad in, every representative of that city
in the Senate, with one or two exceptions, is setting
his judgment up against the combined voice of the
business and commercial interests of the city." Mr.
Smith went on to add: "I believe a new day has besn
born in California and that the people appreciate that
it is unwise to fight a new railroad, and the best pol
icy is to meet it fairly and do business with it on
business principles. You have seen Kansas City, St.
Louis, Chicago, Indianapolis and a score of inland
cities grow up. What has done it? The railroads.
It is the destiny of the age that wherever steel rails
converge there you have prosperity. You can no
more build a city without railways than you can a
railway without steel."
No intelligent man will question the soundness of
those statements. In times past the people of Cali
fornia had good cause to fight the Southern Pacific
Railroad. That corporation not only practiced ex
tortion upon the industries of the State by fixing ex
cessive freight rates upon trade and traffic, but it
There should- never have been any opposition to
the.bill at all. The lease was not made in a- hurry. It
was carefully considered, not only by the Harbor
Commissioners and other State officials, but by the
merchants and business men of the city. Every
feature of the lease from. first to last was duly ex
amined and criticized with respect to its validity, its
fairness and its expediency. The result of the pro
longed discussions of the subject was the adoption of
a measure that is satisfactory to every important in
terest of the city, the State and the railroad. The
bill went before the Legislature with the actual in
dorsement of many of the foremost business men of
the community and with the virtual indorsement of
all.
CONGRATULATIONS are in order among the
people of San Francisco and the State upon
the passage by the Senate of the China Basin
lease. The thanks of the community are due to the
men who made the auccessful fight for the measure
against an opposition which we regret to have to say
was led by Senators fiom San Franci%co. The pas
sage of the measure in the Senate gives reason for the
belief that it will be promptly passed by the Assem
bly, and the way will then be open for the work that
is to give San Francisco and California the additional
transportation facilities which have been so long
needed.

adoption of these modes was not in ex
treme. Our leg-of-mutton sleeves were
not stiffened with whalebones nor stunted
with down pillows. Our skirts were
longer, and we had beautiful and useful
capeÂ«. instead of scarfs and shawls, and
we had not the same, ungainly form of
hair dressing. v
One curious and yet graceful ornament I
of the fashion of 1S20 to 1840 we did not re
vive. I refer to the feronniere. or band
around the head, from which depended a
jewel or ornament over the middle of the
forehead, as may be seen in scores of
portraits. With the smoothly banded or
slngleted hair it gives to every counten
ance a curiously submissive took, as if
the jewel were hung on a slaveâ it is. I
believe, an Oriental fashion. This feron
niere was often composed 6f fine gold
Venetian chain: sometimes also of black
velvet ribbon, of fine vines of artificial
flowers, of silken cord, or strings of beads.
By 1S37 the. style of the gown was
slightly changed. The bodice became
pointed and the waist smaller: the sleeves
also were smaller, and a pelerine was
warn tight-drawn over the folded arms.
The skirts were lornrer. The girlish por
traits of Queen Victoria show these
modes. Bows of ribbon down the dress
front and larpe oval brooches were all the
fashion. Muffs, bounuets, fans and para

Harry Rethers graduated from the Uni
versity of California In 1833, and after
vainly waiting for an appointment to
West Point enlisted as a private, donning
the suit of blue a few months after re
ceiving his degree of A. B. He made an
ideal soldier and his merits soon attracted
attention. Early in 1S06 he entered the
lists for the shoulder straps of a second
lieutenant, passing the examination with
tlylng colors. He was assigned to Com
pany D, Xinth Infantry, and during the
Cuban campaign made an enviable repu
tation as a fighter and tactician. He re
ceived his promotion to a first lieutenancy
on September 8. 1898. being assigned to the
Second Infantry in January, 1899. He was
transferred to the Ninth Infantry a morith
later. â¢
He served with distinction In the Phil
ippines and the outbreak of the trou
bles in China saw him embarking
with the famous Ninth Infantry, under
command of Colonel Llscum. for the scene
of strife. Lieutenant Rethers participated
in the famous battles around Tientsin and
the death-dealing march to Peking, dis
playing such valor that he was recom
mended for a brevet. Dread dysentery at

The comity which exists between different
rtPFnrtments or a government permits and may
justify the assumption by the Civil Service
Commlflslon that a necessity exists solely by
reason of the fact that another department a im
plies fcr a certified member of the civil ser
vice. Apart from this, there appearn to be no
way provided by which your commission can
be convinced of the existence of a necessity
Section 3, chapter I. article VI,' makes this
department the Judge of its own needs and
grants to it .unusual powers. These power's It
is the duty of the Board to maintain. To sur
render this power of Judgment to another de
partment would be an act of self-obliteration
If generally admitted, It would come to pass
that responsibility for performance would re
main where -it now is. upon this board and
power of performance would no longer be' ours
but be liable to hindrance at the hands of
three gentlemen necessarily unacquainted with
the scope, necessities, principles and njethods
of constructive operations, and, therefore " dif
ficult of conviction as 'to the propriety of a
request.
Inasmuch as the employment of a malo
stenographer was verbally arranged with vour
preMdetst _ and secretary, upon the occasion of
their visit to this office n few days Bince this
board was unprepared to receive your 'letter
of the 12th lnst., disapproving of this employ
ment. '
Last December the Board â¢ of Works
made a reauisition for a male stenogra
pher, but was informed by the Civil Ser
vice Commissioners that there were no
male ellcibles. but that they were pre
pared, to certify a name from i the list
which was composed of females only
Nothing more was said about the matter
until it was learned that Mogan had been
selected for the place, wnen the Civil Ser
vice Board demanded an explanation as
to why It had not been consulted in the
appointment. It drew attention to the
charter provision which says that "to pre
vent the stoppage of public business or
to meet extraordinary exigencies, the
head of any department or office mav
with the' approval of the Commissioners'
make temporary appointments, to remain
in force not exceeding sixty days, and
only until regular appointments under the
provisions of this article can be made-
It Is upon this provision that the" two
boards have again clashed. President
Mendell contends that his board alone has
the power to determine the' necessity of
appointing erftra employes, and that the
Civil Service Board's function of approval
Is purely ministerial. The latter bodv
claims, however, that- it has the right to
investigate the necessity for the appoint
ment. Voluminous correspondence has
passed and Mayor Phelan has taken a
hand in the fray. In a letter to President
Freud, the Mayor agrees with Mendell's
contention that the approval of the Civil
Service Board is merely perfunctory but
advises that the disputed point be referred
to the City Attorney, which was accord
ingly done yesterday. Incidentally. Men

Important Development in the Liti
gation to Force the Corpora
tion to Pay War Rev
enue.
After trsviriR its patrons wrongfully for
thousands of dollars :.nd lighting bitterly |
in the courts for nearly two years Wells, j
FarffO & Co. has practically admitted !
the notorious tajustlcfl of their position in J
reference to the payment of war revenuv !
i-tamps. Attorneys for the company have '
gone into the State courts, paid the Judg-
IBeatl demanded and the ccsts incurred
in suits Instituted against the corpora-
T!on. This action on the part of Wells.
Farjro & Co. is a practical admission of |
the ; j .ccu?atioa that the corporation has
been imposingr on its patrons in order that
It might not be forced to pay its Just obli
gations to the Xational Government.
Tho attorneys representing the express
mrr.pary have practically confessed judg
ment in the various suits brought apainst
it by citizens who would not submit to
the Improper charge and â¢ took their
pricvance? into court. This action on the
tart of the attorneys seems to indicate
conclusively that the company has n:>
;-cal ground upon which it cn'n hope to
;uFtify Its mulcting of the public in the
ciormouj sums made up by the innumer
able stamps told. The amounts illegally
'.aken from large concerns by the express
company represent a great deal of money
in each case, while the public in. general
has contributed thousand? to the coffers
<'f the corporation that should never have
been paid.
Though the confessions of judgment, or
v.hat amounts to the same thing, were
made on the 1st ins^t. they have not been
made matters of record yet, and probably
never will be. There seems to be a desire
on the part of the representatives of
"Wells. Kargo & Co. to keep the final
proceedings a secret. The final statc
:npnts would probably have not becorce
known at all had not cne of the pla?n-
Tiffs, who had the daring to assert his
rights against the corporation, made tha
announcement that he had received the
amount of his judgment. 55. and that the
costs of his suit had been paid by tiie
company.
Attorney Pillsbury. chief counsel for
the express company, says that no con
fessions of judgment were made. Some
of th* suit? had been "settled," he said.
by Alfred Sutro of his office by payment
Of costs and the amount of the judg
ment to Georpe D. Squires, plaintiffs at
torney, but this action was in no way
a confession of judgment. Mr. Pillsbury
sail there is a gTeat deal of difference
between paying to an attorney the cost*
and the amount awarded a plaintiff by
the court and a confession of judgment.
The firtt suit against the express com
pany was brought in Justice of the
Peace Barry's court by W. E. Ccstley in '
August, IS38. He asked for $50 damages
because Wells. Fargo & Co. had refuswf"
to send a package for him unless he paid
fnr the revenue stamp on the bill of lad
ins:, or receipt. B. Johnson and G. )*.
Benham eubseuuently filed suits on the
fame groundp. in the same court and in
:hr same amount.
Attempts were made by defendant's at
torneys to get these suits into the United
S;;;tes Circuit Court on the ground that
a Fr-deral question was involved, but
Sv.S.po Morrow ordered them back in'.o
ihe Justice's? Court, saying- that this
e-.>urt had jurisdiction. The proceedings
'n the (federal court, it is said, were
taken simply to cause delay. Well?. Far
po & Co.** representatives hoping that in
ihe meantime the t'nited States Supreme
'^mirt mig-ht hand down a decision bus
â¢ !nlng thÂ«:n. They seem to have given
up that hope.
In each of these cases Justice Barry
rendered a decision for plaintiff for $5
and rests. Each case was appealed tc
Ibe Su:>erior Court by the express com
par.y. and now in each the judgment and '
corts have been paid.
Then came the novel suit of Farrell
vÂ«=. (V>tU. Fargo & Co.. In which the
plaintiff sued to recover 5 cents he had
paid the defendant corporation under
protest for stamps placed upon a receipt.
Thi? case was called before Justice Diinn
pa February 8. and on March 1 the 5
<-r-r.Ts demanded and the costs were paid
by the ciefendant.
Mr. Pnistrarf personally argued tho
cases bef->r<5 Justice Barry and also made
ihe argument on appeal in the Superior
Court.
"I never authorized confession of judg
ment in either of these suits." said Mr.
Pillsbury. "'Two of the cases came up
a cay or two after the repeal of the rev
enue law provision providing for this tax.
and Mr. Sutro said it would he cheaper
to pay the judgment and costs than to
p.rpue th^m further. I said all right, anil
don't know what he did about it.
"No. sir. the action was not taken be
cause we realized that we did not have
R kg to stand on. I still hold that wo
are right. The Supreme Court of Michi
gan has sustained us. The suits her*; were
not carried further because the Federal
question was not raised."
In the JIich!gan case tho Supreme
Court held only that an express company
eould include the stamp tax in its rate
for shipping, provided that this inclusion
old not create an excessive rate. It di<i
rot pass upon the question involved here,
whether or not a company could force
the shipper to pay the tax in addition t'Â»
the shipping rate.
There is now before the Supreme
Court of this State an action brought op
relation of the Attorney General which
will settle the question involved in Jus
tiro Barry's court.
Upon motion cf Attorney Oeorgp D.
Squire* the eases of Johnson and Benham
pjrainst Wells. Fargo & Co. were stricken
from Judge Graham's calendar yesterday.
It was announced by Sauires that a set
tlement of the cases had been effected out
of court.

eftalrs due to a variety of bearish Influences.
Liverpool was depressed to begin with. North
west receipts were liberal and the weather
of a mild character calculated to stifle crop
damage reports. Commission houses sold heav
ily and during thÂ» first half hour the market
was pounded to 73 >* Hi 75 Vie Then the market
l>ecame dull and under local buying, much of
it Coverinc by shorts, reacted to TS^jc Durlnff
the afternoon the pronounced weakneps-'of corn
and ocÂ«Â« and the discouraging export situation
awoke bears to the possibilities of the Mtua
t'f>n and the market declined with some celer
ity to 7.x: and closed weak U6HÂ« lower at
Corn opened weak on freer country offerings,
liberal receipts and a slack shipping situation.
In sympathy with oats the low point of the
day ws-s reached In the afternoon, but It
steadier! again on the reported engagement of
57 loads for export. May closed \c lower at
40ri l 540'ic.
As was the case yesterday th/Â» oats, market
led in -Â«e weakness of the grain markets, due
to the unloading of the longs. May closed
â¢i*- lower at 24V.
Provisions were active and strong rII day.
The market ojiened at a small advance because
of a light run of hojes and advanced sharply
on buying by Influential packers. The close
was strong. May pork 30c higher, lard 7>ic

Kulomene, which arrived to-night from
Hlogo, Japan, which port she left on
January 20, reports a very rough pas
sage, during which she lost her fore and
main lower topsails, which blew, right

the eastward, and after the two lower
topsails were carried away and the in

ballast shifted, and during tho storm' the
ship rolled so fearfully that it was feared
she would turn turtle. After the breeze
there was a calm and the ship Was tossed

Ex-Alderman James Dunne of Brook
lyn. N. Y., the famous handball plajer,
will arrive in this city to-day. His com
ing has been eagerly awaited by the local
players, who are desirous of pitting their
skill against the Easterner.
J. C. Nealon.a personal friend of Dunne,
received word of his coming. Mr. Nealon,
despite his age. Is one of the best men at
the game on this coast. When Casey and
Dunne were here some years ago Nealon
and "Jack" Bonnet played a series of
games at Ryan's court.
Bonnet has oeen forced to Rive up the
game on account of a serious Injury to his
knee and will not be able to meej Dunne.
Nealon is hopeful, however, of getting up
a match game between Al Hampton, and
pome of the other local experts. Dunne
and Casey are looked upon as being the
leading exponents of the game in this
country. As a team they defeated the
bei=t players In the ITnited States.
Mr. Dunne will be Invited by the Olym
pic Club to exhibit his cleverness in the
club's new regulation court. There are a
score of good men at the club who are

PRINCE ENGALITSCHEFF. a
Russian nobleman, who served on
the staff of General Waldersee in
Peking, arrived on the steamship
America Maru yesterday and is
registered at the Palace.
The Prince might be described in the
social columns of a weekly paper as "tall,
willowy and brimful of magnetism." After
inscribing his name and title In a bold
hand on the hotel register he adjourned
to the grillroom and dallied with some
English mutton chops. At the close of his
meal he was approached by an attache
cf the hotel, who presented the newspaper
reporters' cards. The Prince frowned
down the bearer of the cards, and with
a fierce look at the reporters, suggestive
of the typical Russian Prince in melo
drama, who shouts all through the play
â¢â¢Ba^'k to the mines, you dogs!" he strode
out of the hotel. â¢
Prince Buys Valet a Ticket.
The Prince will never be traced by the
quarters that he drops, as a well known
financier once said of himself, for the
Muscovite noble is thrifty. He called at
the ticket office of an Eastern railroad
and wanted to know the cheapest way to
reach New York. The clerk, not recogniz
ing the distinguished inquirer as a Prince
of the royal blood. Informed him that the
cheapest route he ,knew of was "hitting
a brakebeam."
Eventually the Prince negotiated for a.
first class ticket for himself and a second
class ticket for bis valet to New York.
For the valet to travel second class is con
sidered very bad form by railroad men;
at least that was their decision when they

The Park Commissioners were besieged
last night by a delegation of auto

pelled by gasoline and steam be allowed
the same privileges granted, the' electric
machines. On motion of Commissioner
Lloyd it. was agreed to grant them the

The theory is advanced by some of the
railroad men that the Prjince en his way

ing literature distributed by the Southern
Pacific Railroad. The fruit pamphlets
are bound in attractive covers. When the
reader of one of these books has finished

thing needful to raise apples In California
is to sit on the front porch of the house
erected on the place and listen to them
grow.
Victim of Railroad Literature.
The Prince became communicative to a
clerk employed in the railroad office. To
him the Prince unbosomed himself, stat
ing that he was to visit Del Monte and
that he wns going to look Into the apple

formation the Prince has of his own free
will vouchsafed during his twenty-four
hours* stay in this city. Whether the
Prince intends to invest some of his fat
bank roll in California fruit lands or
whether he will enlighten his serfs in
Russia on the art of raising the apple can
only be found out by some one who is
closer to the Prince than the railroad
clerk.

Dr. Reinhardt had been on the field with
some of the' students during their prac
tice work. Soon after the accident to |
Schuster occurred he ordered an ambu
lance and the helpless man was removed
to the sanitarium, the surgeons being
summoned Immediately from Oakland and
San Francisco. The total paralysis was
regarded by the surgeons as significant of
an extremely serious injury to the spine.
They found sufficient evidence to warrant
them In making. a guarded report that
there was a spinal fracture. Without
giving a final opinion on the" case there is
little doubt in the minds of the doctors
that such is the nature of the injury and
that recovery is practically out of the
Question.
Schuster went out on the field shortly
after 2 o'clock to practice vaulting. On
his first try he ran with his pole, reached
the take-off and swung up into the air.
When near the crossbar and some nine
feet from the ground the pole snapped
Summoned an Ambulance.
The spinal cord had been so seriously in
jured that the Burgeons pronounce the
case extremely critical. The surgeons
who conducted the examination were Dr.
Harry Sherman. Dr. Herbert C. Moffitt,
Professor A. H. Taylor of the medical de
partment of the University of California.
Dr. Carl R. Krone, Dr. D. D. Crowley and
Dr. George Relnhardt. the latter being

BERKELEY, March 7.â Through
the breaking of a pole with
which he was vaulting this after
noon at the university athletic

injuries which will probably result fatally.
The young man was completely paralyzed
from his shoulders down, including his
arms and legs. An exÂ£#nination of Schus
ter's injuries this evening by surgeons at
the East Bay Sanitarium, where the
young student was removed, resulted In
the discovery of a probable fracture of
the spine between the fourth and fifth
vertebrae.

The injury to Schuster is the third case
of fracture of the spinal column which
has~"oecurred at the university during the
past two years. The death of Lee Duff,
who was hurt at football, is still fresh In
the students' minds. In the fall of 1S99
Jesse Hicks, a beginner at the game, had
his neck broken in a tackle at a practice
game on the campus. He survived only a
couple of days, while Duff lived several
months. â¢ ;
Schuster Is one of the popular young
men in the university. He is a junior in
the college of social science and was mak
ing jurisprudence hla principal study. He
Is a member of the glee club and a musi
cian of marked ability. His father, A. C.
Schuster, resides in Santa Barbara, The
young man Is a graduate of the Santa
Barbara High School. While In Berkeley
he resided at 2223 Union street. Hi? rela
tives were notified by telegraph as soon
as the seriousness of the accident was
made known.
The pole which broke with Schuster was
considered strong. It was the one taken
East last year by Jack Hoffman and used
by him during the contests there. The
same pole had been in service here during
the time that rractice has been going on
this season at the university.
Pole Was Considered Strong.
Schuster was a novice at the work he
was doing. Ha had some faults in his
style of handling the pole which he had
realized, and was daily practicing to cor
rect. It was said among the students
who had been watching his vaulting that
the chief trouble lay in his manner of
setting the pole. It was noticed that he
caused the pole to spring In the middle
by throwing hi3 weight across Instead of
with the grain of the wood.
and Schuster fell heavily on the wooden
take-off â a plank set on edge In the
ground where the vaulter leaps. Schuster
struck the obstruction on his back and
shoulders. He lay there unable to move,
and fellow students rushed to his assist
ance. They carried Schuster to the gym
nasium, not realizing at first the serious
nature of the injury. But no time was
lost in sending the young athlete, to the
Oakland Sanitarium, where surgeons at
once took charge of him.

He had taken passage at Victoria, but

followed him aboard r.nd to this ci'.v and
with the assistance of Inspector Osborne
effected the capture here.
When O'Brien was stopped by Spc-oiil
Officer Osborne at the gangplank as he
stepped from the steamer at Schwa
bacher's wharf he protested against what
he called an outrage in being summarily
halted. The officer calmly proceeded to
open the grip, however, and found it
stored with smuggled opium. In all thirty
one-pound tins were packed snugly to
gether in his grip and :n the lining of his
overcoat. Their market value would be
estimated roughly at about $400. The duty
on the whole would am-iunt to $6 a pound,
or $180. As soon as the smuggled opium
was found In the grip Osborne took
O'Brien to the police station and had him
locked up. He also took charge of the
opium.

PROFESSOR JOHNS, *
The wcrld's greatest living palmist and clair-
voyant, can be consulted dally on all affairs of
. life; he advises you whether you will be suc-
cessful In business, mining or lawsuits, etc.;
Professor Johns is beyond the shadow of a
doubt the most scientific practicing palmist
and clairvoyant in the world to-day.
There Is no home so dreary or sad, no life
so hard and blighted, no heart so sad and
lonely, that cannot be set right and kept right
after a visit to this inspired prophet or modern
times: all long-standing and chronic diseases
that have baffled the physician's skill cured
without the use of medicine; he reunites the
separated, settle* lovers' quarrels, causes
, speedy and happy marriage, locates hidden
treasures, removes evil Influences; cures fits;
drunkenness cured without the patient's
knowledge; tells if your loved one is true; en-
, ables you to win the affection of any one you
. defiire; also that which a person is best adapt-
ed for In life Is pointed out; he enables you to
â¢ overcome your enemies; no matter what your
trouble Is. he can and will help you or
charge you nothing for his services.

HEAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Serious Condition Confronts the Bed
lands Orange Growers.
REDLANDS, March 7. â The . orange
shippers of this city and valley are ex
periencing a car famine and unless the
railroad companies supply the necessary
relief within a few davs the growers will
lose thousands of dollars. Such a critical
condition of affairs .iaj never before ex
isted here. Fred Ruggles. manager of the
Redlands Orange Growers' Association,
admits that the situation is a serious one.
The orange shipping season is at its height
and the transportation companies are un
able to supply a sufficient number of car3
to move the heavy crop.
The navels are becoming unusually ripe
owing to the warm weather during the
past week. One nrm here that has ten
carloads on hand awaiting cars for East
ern shipment insists that if immediate re
lief Is not forthcoming the entire lot will
decay. Several large packing houses have
been forced to close because no more fruit
il-ould be received until the 'crisis Is over.
To-day thirty cars were needed and but
four were to be had.
DEARTH OF FBuiT CABS.
ed until further notice, or until the suc
cess or failure of the scheme Is noted.
H. E. Leson of the r L.eson Advertising
Company of St. Louis. Mo., who was se
lected as the advertising agent of the
prune combine, signed a contract with the
association to-day.
The work of advertising and promoting
the sale of prunes will commence at once.
The whole territory east of the Rocky
Mountains is to be exploited. Mr. Leson
went to San Francisco to-day and will
open headquarters at the Palace Hotel,
where he will surround himself with a
score of writers, stenographers and art
ists. Advertising space in the press of
the country will be used. Magazines, peri
odicals and all such publications will con
tain alluring advertisements of the food
merits of prunes and recipes for cooking
them in the various styles. In the large
Eastern cities young ladies will be sta
tioned in stores to demonstrate the cook
ing of prunes.
The full details have not yet been de
cided upon, but California prunes will be
advertised and offered for sale in neat and
attractive packages.
It is expected that this will move the
great prune crop of 1900 into the channel
of trade, and the outcome will be closely
watched by the growers.
Several millions of pounds of the smaller
sizes will be got rid of in by-products.
The directors have set a price of 510 net
per ton on these, with the guarantee that
they will not find their way into the
market. These sizes are under 120s, and it
is said they will bo converted into brandy.
SAN JOSE. March 7.-CalifornIa dried
prunes are to be advertised throughout
the length and breadth of the country and
given the greatest exploitation ever given
any kind of food stuffs. This is what the
directors of the California Cured Fruit
Association decided pn last night. Thirty
thousand dollars a month is to be expend-

The investigation being made by the
Federal authorities Into the cause of the
wreck of the steamship Rio de Janeiro
will be resumed this afternoon, when It Is
expected that J. K. Carpenter, one of the
passengers, will be on hand. It is be
lieved that Carpenter will- be able to
throw considerable light on the question
as to whether the steamship was slowed
down at the time the rock was struck
When the investigation was resumed
yesterday afternoon Second Officer Cogh
lan was called to the-witness. stand The
only material and important testimony
given by him was that the steamship was
proceeding slowly into port when the w"
sel struck, and that if Pilot Jordan had

delivered an entertaining lecture last
night. at Metropolitan Hall. The lecture
was illustrated by more than two hun

A score of guests, mostly ladies, were
in Zinkand's when the crash of glass
startled them and directed their gaze
upward. ' They were still more startled
when they saw the shapely limbs of the
struggling young milliner protruding
through the glass roof. But the vision
quickly vanished, almost before the spec
tators fully recovered the power of
ppeech.
One of the windows of the millinery
establishment opens out on a light well
that, gives light to the Zinkand Cafe.
Ihe spool of thread was on the sill and
was accidentally knocked oft by the mil
liner. The girl was anxious to see where
the spool had gone. She leaned too far
out of the window, and, losing her bal
ance, pitched headlong down tho light
well. Her frightened companions ex
pected that her body had been crushed
Into an unrecognizable mass. To their
great relief they soon heard her calling
.lor assistance. She was sitting astride
cne of the beams supporting the glass
covering of the roof of Zinkand's and
wanted to get down. "I've got the spool."
she laughingly said, "but the next time
I won't be in such a hurry going after
it.'-'.
A ladder was secured by Zinkand's em
ployes and she was taken from, her un
comfortable position. Strange to say,
only one large pane Of glass in the res
taurant roof was broken.
A young and pretty milliner employed
in the Emma Spreckels building on Mar
ket street narrowly escaped being killed
yesterday afternoon by a fall from a
window. on the sixth floor. She lost her
balance while looking after a spool of
thread that had been accidentally
knocked out of the window by her
employer. She fell five stories, alighting
on the skylight over the Zinkand Cafe.
She escaped with a few slight bruises,
but recovered the spool of thread. She
says, however, that she would not again
put herself in the position- of taking an
aerial .flight for all the thread that will
be manufactured during the next cen
tury.

MILLINER HAS
NARROW ESCAPE
Schubner took Dr. Evans to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where Dr. Charles Millar
attended to his wounds. He remained in
the hospital for a few hours and was then
taken to his home.
The soldiers appeared in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday, but as the Judge was
notified that Dr. Evans was very ill and
confined to his bed through tho unmerci
ful beating he had received the case was
continued till Monday. Harris and Roper
A young man named N. Schubner saw
the assault and ran to the City Hall sta
tion, where he notified the police. Officer
J. r. Brazel was sent with the patrol
wagon to arrest the soldiers and he had
to chase them several blocks before he
overtook and captured them. They were
booked on a charge of battery, and the
woman, who was found with the doctor's
nat still on her head, was arrested for
drunkenness.
John TV. Harris of Company A, Tenth In
fantry, and Richard Roper of Company
B, Twenty-eighth Infantry, and a woman,
Nita Pintus, approached him.. The woman
took oft the physician's silk hat and
placed it upon her head. He remonstrated
with her, and the soldiers, who had been
drinking, struck him from each side on
the face, cutting a long, deep gash on his
forehead and knocking him down. HÂ©
was rendered -unconscious.
E. Fabian, iormerly an electrician o?
the United States na\'y, claims to have a
plan for locating Iron wrecks by means
of magnets and electricity. His idea is to
drag for the wreck, and In event the mag
nets are attracted to the hull of the vessel
During the last few days many plans
for locating the wreck of the Rio have
been suggested. The ideas range from the
use of bread filled with mercury, which
the author of this plan sagely' asserts
would be attracted directly to the spot
where the wreck is. to apparatus which
would cost many thousands of dollars.
One gentleman suggested that the "Texas
boy," who is supposed to possess remark
able powers of vision, be sent for to peer
Into the waters of the Golden Gate.
IHvers to Claim Reward.
The divers will file a claim this morning
for the reward, but will not ask for pay
ment until they succeed in fastening a
buoy to the rigging of the submerged ves
sel.
The efforts of The Call and the Japa
nese divers to locate the Rio have induced
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company to
offer a reward of $1000 for any one furnish
ing the exact Information as to the loca
tion of the wreck. The divers of T. Mori
& Co. feel that they are entitled to the
reward, as they are positive that the Rio
is lying in the spot where the drag rope
caught on Tuesday last.
As the launches puffed their way out to
sea the waves dashed over the divers and
newspaper men, and* after proceeding
about a mile it was decided that the con
ditions were too dangerous for work. The
small deck space on the launches affords
nut little room for the men to work, even
in fair weather, and owing to the wash it
was impossible for them to pay out the
drag rope. Diving operations were out of
the question in the heavy sea, as the air
lines would not have stood the strain
The divers reluctantly put back to Har
bor View and the launcnes were anchored.
The Call representatives telephoned to
Lookout Hyslop of the Merchants' Ex
change at Point Iv5bos for half-hourly re
ports as to the conditions of the weather
but learned that the sea was not quieting.
At noon the flood tide ended and the div
ers were compelled to return to the city.
Another attemnt to fasten the drag rope
to the wreck of .the Rio will be made in
favorable weather.
Too Dangerous to Work.
Yesterday the divers purposed using a
750-foot drag rope, suspended in the water
at a depth ranging from twenty to thirty
live fathoms, hoping to fasten it around
the rigging or hull of the vessel. The
launches Sybil and Amy made a start
from Folsom-street wharf at 7 a. m., and
on reaching Harbor View took In tow
the fishing boat carrying the divers and
their apparatus.
At Fort Point the water was running In
a heavy swell, but the launches headed in
the direction of Mile Rock, it being the
intention to make a start with the drag
rope from the rock and sweep over the
same ground covered on Tuesdav last.
The divers were elated by the success
which attended the use of the ISOO-foot
drag rope last Tuesday. The rope was
caught hard and fast for ten minutes in
thirty-five fathoms of water, the drag line
being twenty-one fathoms below the sur
face. This showed that the rope had made
fast to some oDstruction jutting up from
the bottom for a distance , of fourteen
fathoms, which would be about the height
of the Rlo's topmasts if she was resting
at an angle.
Representatives of The Call and the
Japanese divers of T. Mori & Co. made
an attempt yesterday morning to find the
exact location of the wreck of the Rio de
Janeiro, but owing to the heavy sea that
was running It was impossible for the
launches to work.
Wreckage Washed Ashore.
The Merchants' Exel-ange lookout at
Point Lobos reported last evening that
some wreckage from the Rio de Janeiro
had been washed ashore at Bakers Beach.
dog to lead you?"
"Well, blindfolded I mieht need some
thins like that."
The witness In response to further ques
tions said that he did not take any sound
ings to ascertain whether he was being
carried to the southward.
"Don't you think," asked Major Blake
ney, "that it would have been somewhat
of an assurance to you if soundings had
been taken?"
"I could tell by tho sound of the land
whistles," was the reply, "and .they didn't
indicate to me that I was being carried
to the southward."
"When you struck how far off your
proper course were you to the south
ward?"
"Half a mile."
"How long 1 would It take the currant
running at that time to takÂ» you that dis
tance?"
"1 didn't know what the current was at
that time. It may have been ten miles or
more; I could not tell."
Sergeant John Marine of Fort Mlley at
Point Lobos was called upon to sign tho
transcript of his testimony given on thÂ»
preceding day. Major Blakeney asked
whether in his three years' experience aa
a sentry along the shore he had not often,
heard similar whistles to those blown by
the Rio. The witness replied that he often
heard fog whistles, but never signals of
distress. lie added that four or five short
whistles or a long continuous blast were
sitrnals of, distress.
The other soldiers who had testified on
"Wednesday were recalled and asked
whether they had ever heard similar sig
nals. They replied that they had not.
After the soldiers had retired Major
Blakeney remarked:
"They can't tell the truth. 'Twould kill
'em if they did."
None of the soldiers were asked whether
they had heard the passengers shouting
and screaming, although they had mada
statements to that effect to the reporters.
The inquiry will be resumed at 9 o'clock
this morning.
The investigation into the neglect of thÂ»
life-savins station lookout, who failed to
heed the distress signals of the Rio da
Janicro when she struck on the rock?,
was continued yesterday before Superin
tendent Blakeney. Pilot Jordan was again
called to the witness stand and told tho
oft-repeated story of how the Rio'a
whistles sounded signals of distress from
the time she struck until her final plunga
beneath the sea.
The pilot, in answer to a question by
"Ward McAllister, counsel for the Pacifio
Mail Steamship Company, said that tha
distance from the point where the Rio
had been anchored during the night to the
place where she struck on the reef was
three and a naif miles. After going prob
ably a mile and a half the vessel could
have anchored, but beyond that dlstanca
the current -was too strong to admit of
anchoring'. The time consumed by the
steamer going: from the point of anchor
age to the place where she struck was
forty-five minutes, and It was possible to
drop anchor during any part of that
period, excepting the last ten minutes.
"Did you not testify before the Coroner
that you could find your way into this
harbor in a dense fog as well as you could
thread your way along ilontgomery
street?" asked Major Blakeney.
"Yes," was the reply.
"Blindfolded .and without a cane or a
