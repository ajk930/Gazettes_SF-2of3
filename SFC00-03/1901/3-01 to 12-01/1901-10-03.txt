sult John E. Hopkins, better known as
the "Zebra," a union teamster, lies in
the Receiving Hospital with a bullet
wound in his thigh, while William Mc-
Grath, a special officer, who is employed
by the Overland Transfer Company, is
locked up in tho City Prison charged with
having shot Hopkins. The latter in the
hot "mix-up" was also shot in the leg.
The shooting occurred shortly atterll
o'clock, when Market street was crowded
with theater-goers on their way to their
homes. According to McGrath's story he
was walking Along Mason street with two
friends, named Halloran and McDonald,
when he noticed Hopkins and a .half
dozen other teamsters following him.
Realizing that they meant to injure him
McGrath, 'whcÂ» is deemed an unusually
game fellow by his employers, suddenly
turned around and asked Hopkins, whom
he knew, what he meant by following him
and his two friends. With an oath Hop
kins whipped out his revolver and fired at
the special. The latter quickly drew his
revolver and emptied it at his assailant.
Dash Over Olympia Stage.
. Hopkins, although seriously wounded,
continued to shoot at McGrath. Billy
Patton, another union, teamster, who
was with Hopkins, also took a hand in the
shooting. Whil&Nhe was blazing away at
McGratn Harry Rosseter of the firm of
Kosseter & Co. stepped up and took the
smoking pistol from him.
By this time Policemen Driscoll,
Matthewson and Coleman appeared on tho
scene and arrested Hopkins and Patton.
McGrath was also taken into custody.
Shortly after the shooting commenced,
Mc-Grath's two friends started down
Market street, pursued by at least a half
dozen murderous union men. Seeing that
they could not escape, the men ran into a
lodging house above Powell street, expect
ing that their pursuers would not attempt
to further foflovr them. Just as they
reached the top of the stairway one of the
teamsters fired two shots at the . fleeing
men, but failed to hit them. Seeing that
the quarry had escaped the bullets, the
crowd of union men followed the two men
into the house, firing after them. Mc-
Donald and Halloran ran along the hall
way and emerged on the Eddy street side.
Running up tne latter street they darted
into the Olympia Theater, followed by the
angry crowd. Seeing that the teamsters
were still after them, the two frightened
men jumped on the stage, upsetting the
ecenery in their mad effort to escape their
furious pursuers.
Had McGrath on Their List.
Fortunately for them. Captain Wittman
and a strong posse of officers appeared
and after a short conflict put the luiion.
men to flight. McDonald and Halloran
were then escorted to their homes.
"We were quietly walking along the
street," said McGrath in giving his ver
sion of the shooting, "when suddenly, I
saw Hopkins and Patton, together with a
number of other teamsters, following us.
I scented serious trouble and, turning to
them, asked them what they wanted. For
a reply Hopkins drew his revolver fcn<l
fired at me. I quickly returned the fire,
when Patton joined in the shooting. I
shot low purposely, as I was afraid of
hitting some innocent person.
"Hopkins has frequently declared , that
he would 'get me' on account of the part
I took in defending ' the non-union men
who were attacked by strikers in the
barn of. tho Overland Transfer Company.
"As I understood that the strike was
settled I went out with my two friends,
never dreamine that I would be at
tacked.'"
Hopkins, shortly after being taken to
the Receiving Hospital, was visited by
Michael Casey; president of the Team
sters' Union. He refused to make a state
ment, except to say that McGrath had
sent word to him that he was going to
whip him and, thinking he meant it, he
went looking for him.
WILL NOT DISCUSS TERMS.
Furuseth Says the Governor Must Do
the Talking. . -
"You can go to work in the morning.
Now go home and go to bed."
In these words Andrew Furuseth, chair
man of the executive committee of the
City Front Federation, announced last
night at the federation headquarters
that peace had been declared in that
section of the local labor world in which
the federation has been waging war.
The announcement was received with
which spoke volumes and there
were tears in the eyes of some of the
older members as they passed quiciHy
down the steep stairs to carry the good
news home to those to, whom "strike"
means "suffering.'.'
Although the news of the settlement of
the trouble had been circulated through
out the city -during the afternoon - those
most vitally interested refused to accept
it as positive until the action of the ex
ecutive committee had been formally rat
ified. Outside the doors of the room in
which, this ratification was to be made
was gathered- a crowd of anxious toilers,
ail of them wearied- of the conflict, all
of them hoping the pood news was true,
but many of them full of doubt and all
hungry. for the certainty. â¢â¢ Â¦ . Â¦ -.
When the doors opened and the news
of the ratification was announced cheer
after cheer burst forth.
Â¦ "That's the best speech Andrew ever
made," was the exclamation from one
middle-aged sailprman as he tripped
down the- stairs two steps at a time,
emitting "Hurrahs" at every jump.
Furuseth declined to discuss the terms
of settlement. He said it had been
agreed to give nothing in this regard for
publication except such as Governor
Gage should consider necessary. The
matter had been left entirely in the
hands of the chief executive and the
officers of the City Front Federation had
promised to remain absolutely silent as
far as the public was concerned.
"The action of the executive commit
tee'has bedn ratiffed. " The strike is. off
and there will be no mass-meeting to
morrow night." This was ! all the man
behind the late strike would say. " -. -;
While the leaders decline to discuss the
matter the really -. interested parties to
tho settlement are frank in thir expres
sions of Joy at this ending to the strug
gle. They care neither whether they won
nor whether, they lost.: VWe can go to
work to-morrow" was the burden of their
song and it was the cheeriest'. music the
water front has heard for many- a day. â¢
For the first time in quite a while men
gathered along the front in groups.
Everybody was in good humor and there
was never a "Move on" from the mem
bers of Chief Sullivan's water front
squad, who are probably as highly
pleased at the termination of the trouble
as any of the strikers. Pickets who on
Monday night stood their vigllsvbehind
barricades were last night shaking hands

PUBLIC EXPBESSES r JOY;
Settlement of- the Great i Strike Dis
; cussed by All Classes.
It; was. an evening of unalloyed enjoy
ment to thousands 'of citizens last night
when the news of the settlement of the
strike of the teamsters and the City Front
Federation spread like wildfire Â» to every
part of the city. Men discussed it on the
street corners with satlsf action and hun
dreds of housewives whoso, larders have
been for weeks gainfully destitute of sup
plies in* consequence of the flght in which
their husbands were engaged embraced
Governor Gage said at that time that a
further statement might be issued at S
o'clock, but at that hour he said only
At 5 o'clock Governor Gage issued h;3
statement to the pressâ which is printed
In full in this connectionâ announcing that
after full consideration by both sides
"terms and conditions were arrived at ac
ceptable to both, and that I am author
ized by officers of both contending parties
to declare the teamsters' strike and the
collateral and sympathetic strikes or lock
outs originating from the teamsters'
strike are at an end. .which 'I hereby do."
In consideration of the guarantee given
by the draymen the strike leaders at once
declared the strike off and gave to Gov
ernor Gage a guarantee that the members
of the unions would be permitted to go
back to work under the terms stated.
Peace was accomplished at a meeting
yesterdav afternoon in the office of R. P.
Schwerin, vice president and general man
ager of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany, between Governor Gage and the
executive committee of the Draymen's
Association. This conference was the last
of a series of meetings between the em
ployers and Mr. Schwerin as a representa
tive of the Governor, at which terms of
peace Â¦which the strike leaders had
authorized the Governor to make were
under consideration. These terms, em
bodied in written guarantees, were
formally accepted at 4 o'clock and duly
eigned. a.nd by authority previously given
him by the strike leaders and concurred
!n at that time by the officers' of the
Draymen'B Association Governor Gage in
formed the newspapers by telephone that
the strike was declared off, and he ex
pressed the willingness to give to their
representatives a statement concerning
the consummation of the peace negotia
tions, it having been agreed that the
Governor alone should give to the press
whatever Information was deemed advis
able for the public to have for the pres
ent.

Strike Is Declared Off.
the strike sha'.l not be disturbed. The
guarantee has been accepted by the strike
leaders, and tne Brotherhood of Team
sters and the unions that went out in
sympathy with it have released their men
and instructed them to return to work.
The wheels of industry will once more
move unclogged. '1 he full complement of
drays will again be sent out and the pro
tection of policemen will no longer be
necessary. Longshoremen, sailors, ma
rine firemen and other laborers along the
water front will take up the welcome bur
den of daily toil, guards will be removed
from wharves and gates will be thrown
open again. To-day will see a trans
formation in th<=> wholesale district and at
the docks through the abandonment of
all the safegnards and devices made
necessary by the abnormal conditions that'
obtained during the strike.
The controversy between the draymen
and the teamsters led to the general
strike, and the settlement of that contro
verEv removes all cause for the continu
ance of the general strike. The draymen
do not agree to any concessions against
which they previously took a stand, but
they give the teamsters the protection of
a guarantee, delivered into the hands of_
Governor Gag-, that wages will not be"
cut. hours of the workday increased or
pay for overtime decreased during the pe
riod of a year. They agree further to re
instate as many of their former employes
as they have places for, but do not agree
to discharge non-union men who have
given satisfaction in order to make room
for. the union men. There is to be no dis
crimination against union men, but all
employes are to obey orders in regard to
the conduct of the employers' business.
Continued From Page One.
The fear on the part of the strikers that
a return to work would be followed by
serious cuts in wages and lengthening of
the work-day has been a stumbling-block
for weeks In the way of a settlement of
the controversy. While individual em
ployers asserted that no reduction in
wages or changes In hours would be
made, the teamsters felt that some pro
tection was needed, and the scheme of
the guarantee to be placed in the hands
of the Governor was devised.
Governor Gage at the Palace Hotel last
evening declined to make known the
terms on which the strike was settled, but
said the settlement was fully accom
plished. In reply to questions he said
that the agreement was in writing, signed
by the duly authorized representatives of
the Draymen's Association, the Brother
hood of Teamsters and the City Front
Federation. He stated that the . agree
ment, signed and sealed, -was in his pos
session. When asked If the Employers'
Association was a party to the adjust
ment he replied that he did not wish to
speak on that subject. He said that ne
gotiations In the progress of the settle
ment were conducted in writing, and for
that reason muoh time was taken to bririg
about the adjustment.
The negotiations that resulted in the
settlement of the controversy yesterday
apparently had their beginning in two in
dependent efforts at mediation. Mayor
Phelan,- in a sisrned statement given to
The Call last night, says that a few days
ago he secured a meeting between two
men, representatives of the two sides to
the labor controversy, and that it was
there agreed that the interpretation of
paragraph four of M. F. Michael's letter
of August 2 was the only thing" that stood
in the way of settlement; that an inter
pretation was agreed upon, and that only
the method of announcing this agreement
was left undetermined. Governor Gage,
Mayor Phelan says, was chosen, subse
quently it is presumed, to make the an
nouncement and declare the strike ended.
Governor Gag-e was -authorized some
days ago to present peace proposals on
behalf of the City Front Federation and
the Brotherhood of Teamsters to the Em
ployers' Association. R. P. Schwerin. rep
resenting the Governor, laid those propo
sals before the executive committee of
the Employers* ' Association. Several
meetings were held, at the last of which,
held Tuesday afternoon, the proposals
were put into terms agreeable to the em
ployers and the committee gave its ap
proval and advised the executive commit
tee of the Draymen's Association to meet
Governor Gage and sign the guarantee if
the terms should meet the approval of the
draymen. ...
Draymen Meet Governor.
The executive committee of the Dray
men's Association was requested yester
day at 10 o'clock to meet Governor Gage
at 2:15 in the office of R. P. Schwerin in
the Wells-Fargo building. The members
complied with the request, and at the ap
pointed hour Charles L.. Tilden, presi
dent; George Renner, vice president an<l
manager, and James McNab, Daniel Cut
ter, Charles Everett and M. Strauss were
lit Mr. Schwerin's office. Governor GasÂ«,
Mr. Schwerin and Dan Kevane were the
others present at the conference.
The two guarantees to be placed in the
keeping of the -Governor were read to the
draymen. The one. ;that of the strike
leaders, had been signed by the officers
of the City Front Federation and the
Brotherhood of Teamsters. The other
was ready to be signed by the officers of
the draymen's organization. The ques
tion was discussed in all its phases and
the agreements gone over with care to
insure a/perfect understanding of their
provisions. After the committee had
agreed to approve the terms submitted.

I am satisfied from what I believe to be the facts that it is"closed
with satisfaction to both sides, and that "peace with honor";are
the only words that should be spoken., â¢ . : :
A few days ago I brought two men, representatives of both
sides, together, and it was understood that if paragraph four of the
letter of August 2 addressed to me by M. F. Michael was satisfac
torily interpreted, the strike would possibly be closed. That para
graph, which was the bone of contention, was satisfactorily'inter
preted. It was then discussed how to make the announcement, and
I see it has been made through th e Governor. - - â¢ : ; .
. I only regret that two months ago, when the letter, was written,,
better judgment did not prevail on both sides. It should have been
clearly understood then. That letter concedes the right of the men to
form unions for the amelioration of their condition and the em
ployers on their part state in paragraph four that it is not their pur
pose or intention to discriminate against any one because. h'e. employs
union men. That leaves any employer the right to . employ; union
men without being discriminated against by the Association of Em

I hope neither side will mak p any exaggerated claims and that
industrial peace will now be gladly accepted and good feeling again

NAVAL, OPERATIONS DURING THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR, AND TWO MEN WHO ARE EXPECTED
TO FURNISH IMPORTANT TESTIMONY AT THE SCHLEY COURT.
. Commander Sharp said in ' response to ques
tions by Mr. Raynor that one of the results
of Â¦ the bombardment- of the. Colon had- been
to develop the Spanish shore batteries. Mr.
Raynor then asked:
"Do you recollect a conversation with Com
modore Schley in the presence of Lieutenant
Harlow In which the commodore remarked
that his purpose had been to develop the
strength of those batteries?"
"I really do not rememoer," was the.re
sponse, "I wish I could."
In response to a question from Mr. Raynor,
Commander Sharp said that the position of
the Vixen during the blockade was not cor
rectly given by the official chart. He was
nearer* the ehore than, there shown.
On redirect examination Captain Lemly
brought out the fact as to the change in the
Harlow notes.
Judge Advocateâ Did you attach to your of-
"Did you furnish a copy of these particu
lar notes to any one elseâ any other officer In
that squadron?"
"Not that I remember. There were several
copies printed, but what became of all of them
I do not know." .
i "Did you take a copy or send a copy to
any other commanding or staff officer of that
fleet except Commodore Schley?" ';
| "Not that I remember."
"Will you say that you did not?"
! "No sir, I will not say that I did not.- To
the best Of my knowledge and belief, I did
not of these identical notes.!' _~
Eaw the Brooklyn," responded the witness.
'â¢'She was southward to westward of the
Brooklyn. The Texas was then apparently ly
ing dead in the water. I remarked to some
officer standing near: 'The ship will never
start and those fellows will. get away.' The
Brooklyn was. then . swinging around toward"
the Spanish fleet."
"How near was she to the Texas?"
"I could not give an estimate of the dis
tance."
On cross-examination Commander Sharp was
questioned in great detail by Captain Parker
â¢in regard to entries in th<Â» Â»og of the Brooklyn
for, the period covering the Cuban campaign.
He referred to the entries concerning the
Vixen's firing upon a locomotive engine on
shore near Santiago, taking It for a gunboat.
He elicited from the witness the statement
that at the time the Vixen must have been,
very near the shore. $
Captain Parker then questioned Commander
Sharp Â¦ concerning the notes made of the bat
tle of July 3 by Lieutenant Harlow on board
the Vixen. Â¦ This report has occasioned no
little controversy, it being claimed by some
of Admiral Schley's friends that after a copy
of "the notes was delivered to the Â¦ Admiral
(then commodore) by Commander Sharp, they
were changed somewhat. The witness said
that he had taken a carbon copy to the com
modore after the battle.
"Do these notes state the truth of the bat
tle as you saw it?"- asked Captain â¢ Parker,
and the witness replied: "These are Lieu
tenant Harlow' s notes. He took them and I
am not prepared to say yes or no whether
they are absolutely correct in every particu
lar or not."
"Have you not read them over several
times?"
"I have."
"Now, are you not prepared to say to the
best of your knowledge and belief they con
tain a true statement of what Lieutenant Har
low saw?"
"I cannot tell what Lieutenant Harlow
saw."
"You do not know whether they (the notes)
are true or not from having read them over
several times and from your own knowledge
of the battle?"
"In the main essentials I should say that
they are true, but there may be mistakes and
probably are mistakes. In them."
"Is It possible that this could have occurred?
The Vixen was constantly on errands of ;hls
sort?"
Mr. Raynor â Do you remember when you
ramied to Commodore Schley the typewritten
transcript of the Harlow notes from which the
I>an>i>hlet was printed, that you said: 'Commo
dore Pchley. these are the true notes of the
flpht. which will stand?' " r . ,
"1 have no recollection of using such lan
Â£ruas. J ."
"I want to see if you recollect this Incident:
Do you remember that on the afternoon of the
first or second of July you were called along
sulfÂ» the Brooklyn and by a megaphone messasa
from Lieutenant Sears, speaking for Commo
dore Schley, directed * to igo to the New
York and report to Admiral Sampson that Com
modore Schley had observed suspicious move
ments of smoke in the harbor. Indicating that
vessels Â¦were moving toward the entrance, and
that Commodore Schley thought the enemy W3F
preparing to come out? That you did go to the
New York and report to Admiral Sampson as
directed and that by Admiral Sampson vou
we*-e ordered to " go to each vessol on "the
blofk-ade and repeat Commodore Schtey'e mes
sage, with an additional order from Admiral
Samjycn directing the ships to close In and
'keep a sharp lookout: that you perform&l this
duty, ami so reported later in the same <Jay
th.-it you had done as directed?" -
Â¦ -"I have no remembrance of the occurrence
I am sort" to say: I wish Lesuld rer.ioinb*r "
Captain Parker â You can hardly remember at
this time whether the Brooklyn was on the
starboard or port bow, can you?"
"Yes, sir; my Impression Is she was on the
port bow."
Captain Parkerâ Now. knowing that fact,
may it not be possible that, before you sent
those notes to the commodore, the word "star
board", may have beeiwchanged into "port" or
vice versa? If you re'ad the notes over before
you took them to the commodore and saw any
Inaccuracies in them, you probably would have
changed them, would you not?
"I am afraid I did not look them over as
carefully as I should have done. That Is an
error undoubtedly about the Brooklyn being
on the starboard bow. It was on the port
side."
Captain Parker also called the attention of
the witness to 'the entry in Lieutenant Har
low's notes wherein he said: "11:15, the Iowa
Is gaining on the Massachusetts" and asked if
he had read the notes at the time, calling his
attention to the fact that the Massachusetts
was then at Guantanamo. Commander Sharp
replied that he did read the notes, but thought
he must have overlooked this notation.
Captain Parker then asked whether it was
not true that the changes from the original
copy appearing in the Brooklyn print had been
made by Lieutenant Harlow himself before he
delivered the transcript .to him (Sharp) for
Commodore Schley. The witness replied that
he did not think so.
Cross-examining the witness Captain Parker
elicited from him the statement that the
printed word "starboard" In Lieutenant Har
low's entry for 11:45.' as printed In the Brook
lyn print of the notes, corresponded with the
official print as given In the appendix, that
word being given In place of the word "port,"
as originally - stated in the notes.
"What was the effect of the differences be
tween the copy of the log book and the notes?"
"The copy of the Brooklyn's printed, notes
would put the Brooklyn farther inshore or
the Vixen farther out, sir, as the case might
be."
Commander Sharp (reading)â "The Brooklyn
one point on the port bow, distant about three
miles." In the notes: "The Brooklyn one
point on the starboard bow, distant about
three miles."
Commander Sharp (reading)â The two leading
ships were well on her starboard quarter. It
says "quarter" here and . "bow" In the notes
of the Vixen's log.
"Then the Brooklyn Is placed further ahead
by the printed copy of the log, is she not?"
"Either ahead or the ships of the Spanish
fleet astern, yes, sir."
"In the entry made at 11:45 a. m. it appears
from your fog that the Brooklyn bore one
point on the port bow of the Vixen, does it
not?"
Commander Sharp (reading}â The two leading
enemy's ships were well on her starboard bow,
yes, sir. #
â¢"Now. in the copy printed on the Brooklyn
what is the bearing of those ships?"
â¢ When the court reconvened after luncheon
Captain Lemly continued his questioning of
Commander Sharp concerning the changes in
the notes made by Lieutenant Harlow, as fol
lows:
Judge Advocateâ In the entry made in your
log, hour 10:15, -the two leading ships of the
enemy are given as well on the starboard bow
of the Brooklyn, are they not?
At this point Judge Advocate Lemly had the
witness compare the original copy of the Har
low notes with the copy printed on board the
Brooklyn, with the result of showing that the
notes had been changed before being printed,
so as to make the account say that at 10:05
the two leading ships of the enemy "bore well
on the Brooklyn's starboard quarter" Instead
of on her '"starboard bow," and that at 11:43
the Brooklyn was "one point on port bow" in
stead of "one point on starboard bow."
"What does it purport to be?" ' â¢
"An account of the engagement with the
Spanish squadron as seen from the United
States ship Vixen July 3, 1898, United States
ship Brooklyn, flagship." â¢ . Â¦
ficlal report of July 3 a copy of the notes of
said action? - - . .
"Yes, sir."
: "Where did you obtain this copy?"
"From the executive of fleer, Lieutenant Har
low," ;- / â¢ .
"Did you at that time know whether there
were any differences between this copy as at
tached to your official report and the copy as
it appears in your log book?"
"Yes, sir, I knew there were some slight
differences."
"From whom did you learn that there were
these differences, and was .any explanation
made of this fact to you?" â¢ "
"When I was writing my report of the action
of July 3 I said to Lieutenant Harlow: 'I de
sire a copy of ' your notes taken during the
action to accompany my report to the admiral.'
His reply, as near as I now remember it, was:
'Those notes were taken for the representative
of a newspaper on board the Brooklyn and I
would like to make some changes in them.' L
said: 'Very well. I wish the notes to go with
my report.' He afterward submitted to me the
notes written in script, which I read over and
Inclosed in my report to the admiral."
VMention has been made of the copy of the
notes sentto the Brooklyn which were printed
on board that vessel. Do you recognize that
paper?" (Handing him a printed pamphlet.)
"I have seen a copy of this before. If I
am not mistaken several were sent through the
Vixen." .

Lieutenant Commander Sharp Tells

He might have given several orders at about
that time I did not hear. Of course I did not
note everything I heard."
Yeoman Becker was then recalled -and was
excused after brief questioning concerning the
dispatches prepared by him at Key West for
Admiral Sampson for Admiral Schley. He then
said that according to his recollection these
dispatches "were forwarded by the Iowa and
the Dupont. but said that his statement was"
based entirely upon his memory-
I Commander Sharp said that the Vixen had
carried Commodore Schley from the Brooklyn
to the Massachusetts on May 31 before the be
ginning of the bombardment of the Cristobal
Colon, and that when he had asked what course
he should pursue in the approaching: action,
Leutenant Sears had replied for the commo
dore that the latter had directed that Com
mander Sharp keep his craft clear, as she was
vulnerable and should not assume any risks.
He thought the commodore had afterward
epoken to him to the same effect
Mr. Hanna â Passing onto the battle of July
3. did you see any portion of the loop made
by the Brooklyn?
. "When I first saw the Brooklyn I think she
was headed about south, and swinging very
rapidly under her port helm."
"Did you at any time have any conversation
with any person in the presence of Commodore
Schley with respect to the direction in which
the Brooklyn turned on that occasion?"
"Yes, sir."
"State the circumstances of that conversa
tion."
"I took on board .the... Brooklyn a copy of
the notes taken by Lieutenant "Harlow, the
executive officer of the Vixen, during the en
gagement, and showed them to the commodore.
The commodore was seated at his desk, as I
remember it, and at various times different of
ficers came into the commodore's cabin. Cap
tain Oook was there, I think, at one time. The
navigator of the Brooklyn, Lieutenant Hodgson,
came in also. I think Commander Eaton was
In at one time and, if I am not mistaken. Cap
tain Barker was In. I was talking to the
commodore about those notes, and at one part
of. the conversation, on the way the helm of
the Brooklyn had been put to form the so
called loop. I stated that the helm was put
to port. Lieutenant Hodgson . spoke up and
said: 'No, you are mistaken. Helm was put
to starboard.' I said: 'No, no; you put your
helm to port.' He said: 'I can prove it to
you. Look at this chart.' I -said: 'I don't
want to see -the chart.- You swung . with . the
port helm.'.,"
"Was it conceded â¢ finally," asked Captain
Lemly< "that the helm had been put to port
to make the turn?"
"I am not positive." was the reply, '.'but it
is my Impression that it was."
"By whom was the concession made?"
"I do not remember."
"Were there any Instructions at that time
to the navigator In regard to entries in the
log?"
."Not that I remember." Â¦Â¦ .
"Did you see the Texas during the battle off
Santiago?? asked Mr. Hanna. . â¢
"I saw the Texas about the "first time I
"Under those, circumstances could you have

"I. think not All we saw was the light."
who commanded thaconverted yacht Vixen dur
ing the Spanish war, was the first new wit
ness of the day. He testified that he had first
fallen in with the flying squadron on the morn
ing, of May, 24 ofC Cienfuegos. He said that the
weather on the cruise from Cienfuegos to San
tiago.had been "squally," but not sufficiently
bad to Interfere with the speed' of the Vixen.
The vessel had . not, he said, been In urgent
need of coal on May 26. "If I had been," he
said, "and -received orders to coal, I should
have-tried to do so, though it would have been
an uncomfortable job, because the Vixen was
a very small ship."
* Commander . Sharp said that notwithstanding
he had been on board the Brooklyn several
times. Commodore Schley had never discussed
with him the retrograde movement toward
Key West begun on May. 26. Describing the
service of the Vixen during the siege of San
tiago under Commodore Schley, Commander
Sharp said that he had been placed on picket
duty at the eastern end of the line on the night
of May 29 and had continued this duty after
ward. He was about two miles from the
shore, he said, and probably three miles from
the mouth of the harbor. He said that the en
tire fleet could not be discerned at night and
that the shore line could only be discerned as
a black mass in the distance.
Mr. Hannaâ Could you have seen a vessel
undertaking to pass out near the shore under
those conditions?
"If she had shown no lights and made no
noise; I do not believe we could."
"Did you at any time suppose yourself to
have discovered a torpedo boat attempting to
escape?"
"One night we sighted a light, running ap
parently alongside shore, with a good deal of
speed, and signaled that it was a torpedo boat
escaping. It turned out to be a locomotive
headlight on the railroad."
"The next thing- I heard waÂ« the range
riven, and Just then the starboard twelve-
Inch gun was fired almost fore and aft of the
ehlp. I Jotted that and went around to port
Thomas Dieuaide. the newspaper man, when
called to correct his testimony of yesterday,
made a brief addition to his response to one of
Admiral Dcwey's questions. The question put
by the admiral was whether he (Mr. 1 Dieuaide)
had heard Captain Philip give orders to back
engines, when the two were on the bridge of the
Texas during the battle off Santiago. Mr
Dieuaide had replied that he might have heard
the order and he might not. To-day he said In
explanation of this statement:
Mr. Raynor said he would object to the pre
sentation of the letter at this time, but not at
the proper time. He said the proper time for
this will be when Captain Cook is on the stand
Admiral Evansâ I withdraw it.
Mr. Raynorâ I am perfectly willing you shall
submit It at the proper time.
After pome further colloquy the Incident
doted.
"The question was put to me as If I had
rtated 'I had shot the bow off the Pluton,
raked this ship and knocked out another one
etc.' There Is Captain Cook's letter denying
that such a conversation took place."
Mr. Raynorâ The point Is whether the conver
sation was between you and Commodore
Sehley.
"Certainly." handing it to Mr. Raynor. "It
lc a matter entirely personal to me, sir. The
way the question was put to me yesterday put
me in the position of having bragged of de
stroying the whole Spanish fleet on board the
Brooklyn. The identical words were used in a
letter purporting to come from the Brooklyn
and published in a Washington newspaper of
July 25, 183S. I immediately went to the editor
of the paper to ascertain the author of such a
letter and he, after a good deal of trouble, as
certained that it was a woman who had given
this information. Whether she was paid fpr it
or not I could not find out. At the same time
I wrote to Captain Cook of the Brooklyn, in
closing the article, and there is his reply. I
should like that letter to go In the testimony
In connection with the testimony, as the words
are the identical words used in this scurrilous
letter published in the newspaper."
Mr. Raynor â I do not object to any explana
tion at all that you may make. There was
nothing wrong in the question itself."
Admiral E% - ans was the first of the witnesses
of yesterday, who appeared for the purpose of
making corrections in his testimony. Having
made these corrections. Admiral Evans rose
and formally addressing; the court, said:
"May It please the court. In connection w'th
or.e of the questions asked me yesterday, un
less Admiral Schley or his counsel object. I
chould like to make a statement and produce
a letter. If at any moment counsel object or
Admiral Schley objects, I will withdraw it and
stop."
ilr. Raynor â Could we look at the letter?
The formalities of the day were begun with a
brief explanation of the large chart of the
southern coast of Cuba, which hangs on the
Â»â¢Â«.:] of the courtroom. Thl* explanation was
made by Captain Leir.ly, who said the chart
had been prepared from data collected since
the war with Spain and was much mere cor
rect than former charts. Captain Parker on
behalf of Admiral Schley said that with these
explanations he was willing to accept the chart
as authentic.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â The proceedings to
day befran with the usual recall of former wit
i:espcs for the correction of their testimony in
the official record. After these came Chief
Teoman Becker, who had bepua his testimony
yerterday and was on the stand when the pro
ceedings closed. He was at that time under
cross-examination by Mr. Raynor, and that

Admiral Evans. Captain Sigsbee and
Correspondent Dieuaide were all recalled
for the purpose of correcting their testi
mony as given yesterday, and all made
additional statements.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â Among
the important witnesses at
to-day's session of the Schley
court of inquiry was Lieu
tenant Commander Sharp,
who commanded Ihe Vixen during the
Spanish- American War. He was examined
at great length on the operations off
Santiago and particularly about discrep
ancies in the notes of Kxecutive Officer
Harlow of his ship and the copy of the
log which was included in the official
record. The witness admitted that some
changes had been made.
An interesting turn was given to the
inquiry by the introduction of the first
witness in Admiral Schley's behalf. This
was lieutenant James B. Doyle, who was
a watch officer on board the flagship
Brooklyn during the war with Spain. The
fact that Lieutenant Doyle was put on the
stand does not mean that the Navy De
partment has concluded the presentation
of its side of the case. Mr. Doyle was
called by the department, but as it also
had been the purpose of Admiral Schley
to summon him, advantage was taken of
his presence on the stand to question him
as an original witness for the "applicant."
He was under examination by Mr. Raynor
in the interest of the admiral when the
court adjourned for the day.
Before undergoing examination at Mr.
Raynor's hands. Lieutenant Doyle, at
Captain Lemly's request, explained his
part in the battle of July 3 and his
original entry In the ship's log concern
ing the famous loop and his alteration of
that entry because he subsequently dis
covered that his first entry had been
erroneous.

MHEN the Lord Bishop of Newcastle was introduced to the House of Bishops yesterday after
noon he presented the following letter from the Archbishop. of Canterbury:
August 17, iqoi.
"MY DEAR BISHOP OF NEWCASTLE: I shall be glad if you will take the oppor
tunity â and especially the opportunity you will have when you attend the proposed convention
at San Franciscoâ to express the warm desire of the Episcopate of the Church of England to facilitate 'and en
courage the most frequent and cordial intercourse between ourselves and our brethren on the other side' of the
Atlantic. To know one another, to. know each the difficulties and aspirations and aims of all the others, to feel
the growth that grows out of such knowledge, is a greater blessing by far than it is ;commonly supposed to" be.
faith grows largely,' says Coleridge, 'when I am in the presence of another man who holds the same faith
as I do.' And this is true in the fullest sense. â¢ The growth of the church in extension is the source of a Chris
tian growth in fervor and power. To see Christians makes it easier to love them; and that love reacts on our
love to God himself. I pray earnestly for God's blessing on your visit to the West. Yours affectionately,
"F., Cantuar." .-

IMPRESSIVE SCENE IN FRQNT OF TRINITY CHURCH AS THE EPISCOPAL CLERGY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO ATTEND WORSHIP.
The Bishop stated that his sermon
would be- a Western one in every respect,
and it was for the purpose Of -conveying
to the members of the church from the
East the urgent necessity of financial help
and moral support for the great territory
of the Pacific Coast States in the mis
sionary field. " Â¦
Bishop Morris in part said:
These w6rds from St. Luke's gospel were ad
dressed by our blessed Lord to a fisherman and
his partners who had just passed through a
long night of toll that had brought no reward
lor their labors. The vessel in which they had
spent these fruitless hours, now lying on the
shores of Lake Gennesaret, / had furnished a
convenient place from which to address those
who pressed about . the divine speaker to hear
the word of God; and when he had left speak
ing he. said unto Simon: "Launch out into
the deep and set your nets for a draught"
Simon, answering, said unto him: "Master,
we- have toiled all the night and have taken
nothing; nevertheless, at thy word, I will let
down the net." And when tney had done this
they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and
their net brake, and they beckoned unto their
partners, who went in . their ship, and they
filled both ships, so that they began to sink.
Into the â¢ particulars of this transaction we
need not go to discover lessons and prophecies
concerning the higher calling to I which those
fishermen, were now to . be advanced. It was,
in the flrst place, a sign of the power of Christ.
It was a symbol and a prophetic type of the
new. calling 'Of these disciples, and we may
not doubt that it was an end oÂ£ their fear of
earthly need In following Jesus. But- it was
also a lesson in their own craft. They, were
to launch out into the deep lor this draught.
They were to leave the shores and shoals,
where the natural habits of the fish led them
and where they were accustomed to find them,
and sink their nets deep in the waters- of I thÂ»
sea. What was th!s but a prophecy of- the
great * purpose and destiny of the church of
Christ, for which these Gallileeans and their
successors were henceforth to fish in all the
waters of the world? The narrow net of Juda
ism must'needs break to pieces in'the under
taking. ' ' Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦ :
My brethren of this congregation, it is for
the furtherance of this work, for. the promo
tion of this fishing for men. for spreading your
nets wider and wider, mending them and mak
ing them more enduring and more certain of
gathering in and retaining the fish, for dis

along Bush street to the Gough street
entrance of the church.
Bishops Walk in Procession.
Ahead walked a lad in white surplice
carrying the golden crucifix, then came
Rev Dr. Clampett, rector of Trinity
Church, wearing his surplice. Two by
two followed the Bishops In the order
of their consecration. As the church was
entered the choir and congregation joined
in singing the processional hymn, No. 311,
"Ancient of Days. Who SIttest Throned
Sn Glory," written by Bishop Doane of
Albany. The Bishops were garbed In
the black satin robes of their rank, with
full lawn sleeves. Many of the prelates
also wore the colored hoods of their col
lege degrees. At the door of the church
the procession halted and the younger
Bishops walked ahead and formed in two
lines along the main aisle, so that the
elder Bishops might pass between the
ranks and enter the chancel in the order
of seniority.
Bishop Tuttle of Missouri, the senior
prelate, entered thÂ« chancel rail and was
followed by the Bishops of Albany, New
assembled around the church doors long
before that time. Wire cables had been
stretched in front of the church along
the curbstones and a squad of police was
on hand to watch over the safety of the
assemblage.
The morning was a gloomy one and
a heavy shower of rain occurred an hour
previous to the commencement of tho
services. The carriages bearing the
Bishops and prominent lay deputies rolled
up to the doors of Trinity Church in
almost endless procession.
The arrangements made 'by the local
committees were faultless and every
holder of a ticket knew exactly at which
t3oor the permit for admission to the
church should be presented. The lower
lloor of the church was reserved for the
clerical and lay deputies, while the three
galleries, specially built for the occasion,
were used by invited guests and the
parishioners of Trinity Church.
The choir stalls were given over to the
uÂ»e or the Bishops and the vested choir
robed Bishops and the entire congrega
tion sank to their knees and bowed their
heads In prayer. *,
Bishop Tuttle was the celebrant of the
holy communion service. Bishop Doane of
Albany read the Epistles and the Lord
Bishop of Newcastle read the Gospel.
The choir and congregation joined in
singing hymn 490, "Glorious Things of
Thee Are Spoken," after which Bishop
Morris of Oregon ascended to the plat
form and delivered the sermon. The ven
erable Bishop was heard in every part of
the church and 'his sermon was a mas
terly effort in every detail.

HOLDING SESSIONS IN TRINITY CHURCH
f| T is expected that a strong effort
â¢ will be made by the ritualists
. to i secure ' recognition for their
. following on the floor of the con
" yentiq'h. Although it is claimed
Â¦'Â¦ that the ritualists . have lost
." .â¢ strength - In x the past few
years -they assert that they represent
fully 20 .per cent of the church of Amer
ica. -The "low", church element does not
allow 1 , this claim and says that the ritual
ists only" number about 7 per cent.
The Bishop of Chicago, Rev Dr. W. E.
McLaren/ is considered the nestor of the
ritualists. The Bishop of Fond du Lac.
ReA\ AV. â¢ H. Graf ton, is a powerful, ad
yocate. of the ritualists and it was in his
diocese that the use of certain emblems
and vestments created a stir in Episcopal
church circles. . . :. : . . ' Â¦ Â¦ '
The 'â¢troublesome belt" of the church
-comprises "the States of "Wisconsin, Illi
nois and portions of . adjacent territory.
Bishop Nicholson ,of Milwaukee is cpn
sitiered to be a ritualist and many tninK
that he would follow the leaders If called
upon. . ;
Bishop Seymour of Springfield. 111..,
Bishop Taylor of Quincy, 111., Bishop
JVhitehead of Pittsburg. Pa., Bishop Hall
of Vermont and Bishop Francis of In
diana are- all counted on the ritualist
side.
Their views, expressed In the House of
Bishops, cannot be learned, as the upper
house sits In executive session, but when
the prelates sit with the lower house as
the board of missions it is expected that
the ritualistic Bishops will fully vent
their views upon the subject that for
years has caused a conflict to be waged
in the Church of England and the Epis
copal church of the United -States..;.*. L -

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
AT a recent meeting of the" "Howard Associar
tion of Criminal Experts," a British organi
zation devoted to the study, of penology,
some reports were made concerning the American
system of jails,, and it -appears the experts
pronounced the system to be much worse than that
which obtains in British jails of a similar grade.
Some of our contemporaries have met this criticism
with a vigorous and emphatic denial. It seems to
be the opinion of many of -them that the criticism
upon our jails was virtually an assaiHt upon our
government, and the Atlanta Constitution goes so
far as to say: "The American newspaper that
would uphold any of the charges made by the How
ard Association is untrue to its country."
We have not seen the charges, made by the How
ard Association, and consequently we can neither upy
hold them nor refute them. We have noted, . how
ever, in some of our contemporaries' statements in
tended to prove the American system better than
the British, but which in our estimation prove the
reverse. For example, the Boston Globe says:
"America's alleged increase of! crime, "as compared
with the reported contrary tendency in Great Britain,
is cited as proof of the superior efficiency of British
penal methods. The severity of some of the. British
and Continental jails may possibly work to decrease
crime abroad by, driving criminals out of the coun
try. Certain it is that here in America we have been
obliged to receive some of the refuse of foreign jails.
Some of the British prisons have been notorious dis
graces to the human race. While the prison system
in some cases in this country has been lamentable
enough, the general tendency has been to make them
as humane .as-is^ compatible- with justice. Indeed,
some. maintain that we have erred on the r side of
leniency." .V ' -. :'_'â¢Â¦'-Â¦'
Accepting that statement as- true, th^ question
arises: Why should a jail /which, induces :
criminals to leave the country be deemed-a bad sys
tem? Why should a system that attracts the crimi-'
nal elements of other countries be deemed a good
system? - If the British jails put a stop to crime, or.
at least notably diminish it, and the American jail is
so pleasant as to prove a welcome resting-place ;|or
tramps during the winter months, why should burs
be deemed the better of the two? VAre jails designed
for the encouragement of petty crimes and .the-mani
festation of a. tender humanity/toward the criminals?
> The_CalI believes in patriotism. It is ready and
prompt to uphold any American institution* when as
sailed by a foreigner, but it does not believe that the
county jail system, either in Boston or Atlanta, or
even in some California counties, is above legitimate
criticism by' expert penologists, Certainly no county
in America has yet had any -remarkable success in
dealing with the petty criminals that make-: up .the
habitual inmates of county jails,' and if the Howard
Association can furnish any plan by which we v can
make criminals leave the country or/quit. the trade
it will be worth oiir while to consider it seriously and
not reject it simply because the county jail is an
"American institution/' *-
THE Saturday Evening Post notices the alarm
ing prevalence of typhoid in Philadelphia, ad
mitting that it is the chronic summer condition
in that city. For years the public water supply has
been reeking with filth, and jobbery in the manage
ment of the water suppty, under municipal ownership,
has either prevented any attempt at betterment, or
when such attempt has been made conditions have
become worse, since the consumers, relying upon
official statements that the water was all right, have
been freer and less cautious in its use. It is said that
in all the history of Philadelphia's ownership of the
water supply the municipal government* has been a
willing captive of speculators who know how to make
money for themselves out of the public necessities.
The oldest water plants in the United States under
municipal ownership are those of Washington City,
Philadelphia, Xew York and Boston, and it is an in-,
teresting fact that^for a large part of every year the
water in each of those cities is unfit or dangerous for
potable uses. There is no city with its supply in pri
vate ownership that can show such a record of neg
lect of the public health, which may be affected by
water-borne diseases.
One point put forward in the advocacy of public
ownership is the greater cheapness of the water. But
this point is impossible of proof because nowhere
do the municipal accounts show the oost to the tax
payers, who are also water rate payers, of the public
supply.
It is to be hoped that this phase of the question
will be taken hold of by State Legislatures and that
laws will be passed compelling cities which have gone
into business, in street railroads, water and lighting
plants, to keep their accounts exactly as the accounts
of corporations engaged in the same lines of business
are kept. Only then can anything be known about
the cost cf a municipal water supply. If the claim of
the municipal ownership advocates -now made rela
tive to the comparative cost of water by the two sys
tems, private and public, made upon the face of the
present erroneous system of accounts, be true, it is
evident that correct accounting will show that the
private supply is the cheaper, for the difference
clamed ls such a narrow margin that it will disappear
when it becomes possibly to get a correct balance
from mumapal accounts. This factor in the problem
determined .there remains the question of sanitation !
*s affected by the water supply. Here appears the
cxpenence of Pbiladelph.a, bec* use . f or the bettcr
part of a century the quality of her supply has been
deteriorating, and no effort by the city government
has availed to correct the evil.
At the present time several millions oi dollars have
been put in the hands of the government *f that _-. tv
to purify the water, but the Philadelphia pa Per savs .
"It is probable that the betterment will be l* ss; f '
the citizens than for those who are undertakin ***
bring it about. In any case, long before the citfzenÂ°
obtain the filtered water promised them there it
ample thnc tor typhoid an& other impure water dis
eases to reap their grim death harvest."
Does any one imagine that if a corporation owned
the Philadelphia water plant it would have taken
nearly a century to call it to account and compel it to
purify the supply? Or does any one believe that
when the corporation was compelled to do so the
consumers would be in doubt whether they were
to be benefited in the end? f
The lesson is that government can compel to be
done well that which it cannot do well itself. It will
be interesting to know whether the twelve millions
that Philadelphia spends for filters will be charged
to betterments of the plant and appear as partÂ° <5 f >
the cost of the water supply, or be put to some other
recount in order tfot members of. the city govern

It is stated that the British , Government has ex
pended the sum of $5,000,060' in Missouri and Kansas

signs of any speedy end to the struggle. & : ::$-
BY way of celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of
its first publication theNew/York Times re
cently issued a fac-simile of the first edition
of the.paper, together with an elaborate history of its
career from that time to this/Taken together the two
constitute a striking proof that sensationalism," bf any
other-form of freak and folly, are not necessary to
the success of journalism in this country. .From the
start the Times has been. a legitimate newÂ«(paper, ap
pealing to the intelligence of the public, and it has
found a support sufficient to enable it to grow from
a four-page paper. when it began 6n September 18,
1851, to the large and handsome journal it' is to-day!
There have been many improvements in the world
since the first copy of the Times was published, and
a glance at the fac-simile of that copy shows a con
siderable number of them. k In the first place the
European news was obtained from papers two or
three weeks old that had" been brought over by the
slow-going steamers of those" days, for there were no
ocean cables. In the second; place the principal item
of home news was an account of a fugitive slave riot
in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and attention is
thus directed to the bad conditions of the old'slavery
days.
.On the other hand, the paper affords evidences that
the people of the world were much the same then
as they are now. Thus in an account given of the
visit of President Fillmore to Boston the writer says:
"I am informed that the true friends of the Presi
dent took no part in the formal preparations to re
ceive him, because of the officiousness of certain in
dividuals." It will be perceived from that statement
that^ Presidential receptions then were not widely dif
ferent from those of our time. The officious men
took front seats and the true friends were crowded
-but. Oilier items of "note are a discussion of the Nica
ragua canal route and Great Britain's relations to
it,^and aUetter taken from the, London '-Times dis
.cussing how the British' could win back the yacht cup
that; the America had captured.- In the fifty years
that .have passed since that bygone day when the
light' of the sun first .saw the. Times there' have been
many discussions on those subjects, but they, are still
unsettled.; The cup as yet remains with us, and â¢ the
canal is still in the air.'
Â¦In-tHe course"of its longcareer the Times of course
has had. varying popularity and influence. Its found
ers, Henry J. Raymond and George: Jones, have a
high place in the history of . American ; journalism.
They made the Times a power in the nation, and the
present proprietors and editors are- to be congratu
lated on the success with: which they have kept up the
best traditions of their predecessors and continue to
make the Times an dxemplar of legitimate jour
nalism. Â¦ â¢Â¦.â¢.'â¢ . : â¢ Â¦;;Â¦-Â¦Â¦ ... '.-;.

The lesson has been a costly one, but fortunately the moral is plain. The strike has
ended like all others started upon such pretexts as thi& The amount that has been.lost to
the employers during the struggle may to some extent be made up by them through" the
process, of increasing the price of their commodities, but the losses of the workingmen
can never be regained. They can never recall the days that were passed in idleness nor
obtain the wages they might have earned during all these weeks. Nor will the commani
ty ever make up the loss resulting from the suspension of traffic, and the cost of the ef
forts, to maintain the peace, The price has been paid. Now let us profit by it so that we
will notHiave. to take another lesson of this kind for many a vear to come.
Bad as the strike was in its effects upon the industries and' trade of the community
and of the State, the public will have no word of blame for. the industrious and law
abiding workingmeu of the unions who took part in it. ' They were the victims of lead
ers who forced the strike upon the unions in order that those leaders might have a chance
of posing before the public and of making a pretentious showing of earning the salaries
paid to them out of the fees and dues collected from the industrious. Later jon the strikers
were further ill advised by the pxaminer and by certain inflammatory speakers who 1 ve
hemently insisted th.it the business men of the city were trying to crush the poor into
slavery, and that unless they continued to fight they would be reduced to a condition
worse than that of the serfs of Russia or the slaves of old Rome. . , . â¢ -Â¦
By their clamors and falsehoods these leaders and demagogues managed to prolong
the strike for weeks after the more reasonable and intelligent workingmen were willing
to settle it. They also provoked the lawless to commit those assaults that have in so
many cases resulted in death. They have done their worst, and now the . members
of the unions can look back over the record of the strike and see what such leadership
has cost them, and upon what false pretenses' it was asserted. -Â¦Â¦Â¦
OVER the settlement of the strike in this city there will be "wejl nigh 'universal
rejoicing. Only thpse who fomented and encouraged it, the walking delegates,
the' yellow journal, and the inflammatory writers and orators who were gain
ing notoriety from it, will be dissatisfied. ;As_a whole the_cdmmunity will find
abundant cause for gratification in the ending of a struggle "^
begun and which after entailing heavy losses threatened to culminate in serious riots and
disturbances. ; . Â¦ :"â¢"Â¦. -.. v â¢
There;- was rejoicing in many a workingman's home last evening when the news was
received that; the strike was over and the workers are to returri to their work. The wolf
of destitution that threatened the family vanished when the glad announcement was
made. Once more the days are to be passed in earnest industry instead of idling about
the streets, and'once more wages are to come regularly to. support the home. The sav
ings of past years are not to be drawn upon any longer for daily bread and supplies, but. on
the contrary there are now' to come earnings which will afford an opportunity for more
savings. . " : '- â¢Â¦ :
Nor is it in the homes of workingmen. only that there has been rejoicing. The strug
gle affected to a greater or less extent almost every class in the community. There is
hardly any trade or industry that did not suffer some injury from the prolongation of a
struggle that disturbed business and menaced the peace of the community. Even beyond
the city the news of the settlement will go as glad tidings, for now there will be an end
to the restraints that have been upon the shipment of the crops of the farmers. Traffic
will move forward again, goods will obtain a prompt access to their markets, capital will
begin to circulate and pouring into the channels of trade through the medium ofwajres
will quicken/activity in all lines and restore to the city its wonted prosperity. :"".-Â¦/
â¢ With all this rejoicing The Call has the fullest and heartiest sympathy. From the first
it has deplored the strike and has endeavored to hasten the settlement of it upon terms
that would be satisfactory to all. There was indeed no reason' why the struggle should
have been waged so bitterly or continued so long. The unions were not striving for
any benefit for labor generally, nor for their own members. There was at stake no ques
tion of hours nor of wages. The members of the unions were satisfied with their pay,
with the labor and with their employers. They were called out to make a so-called
'sympathetic" strike upon the wild cry that rich men had*, organized, to (lestroy. labor
unionism. ' .

the office. He has had a long and faithful serv
ice and without . regard to or heeding his per
sonal wishes in the matter, the New York dele
gation presents the name of Rev. Dr. Hunting
ton, D. D., of Trinity Church, New York.
Rev. Dr. Greer of New York nominated
the Rev. Dr. Huntington of Trinity
Church, New York City, in the following
words: Â¦ â¢ .
I presume under the ruling of the secretary
it is not in order for me to say anything at
all, except perhaps to venture to record to this
holy body the absence of him who for five suc
cessive terms has presided with so much grace,
courtesy, dignity and Impartiality over the de
liberations of this house. If he were here now
I. am sure he would be re-elected by a unani
mous vote.

DR. GREER NOMINATES
REV. DR. HUNTINGTON
A majority of the house being present, nom
inations for the election of a presiding of fleer
will now be in order, according to the rules of
the house. It Is understood that there will be
no nominating speeches.
Assistant secretaries Rev. Henry An
stice of Philadelphia, Rev. Edward
Worthington of Cleveland, Ohio; Rev.
Carroll M. Davis of St. Louis, Mo., and
William C. Prout of Herkimer, New
York, had prepared the list of the cleri
cal and lay members of the house and
they were called over by the Rev. Dr.
Hutchins. As the names were called
each member answered and at the end
of half an hour it was announced by the
secretary that 350 deputies were. present.
Secretary Hutchins then said:
form- His associates were Bayard Cut
ting-, Rev. Dr. Greer and Rev. Dr. Hunt
ington. Banker Charles Thomas of Phila
delphia, a partner of Morgan, sat with
the Pennsylvania delegation, close to the
seats of the New Yorkers. The entire
lower floor of the church was laid out for
the deputies and those in the rear of the
edifice will be allowed to-day to occupy
the galleries, owinsr to the poor acoustic
properties of the church. As soon- as the
proceeding's began yesterday the deputies
in the rear of the building complained
that they could not hear the speakers in
front of the building or those who were
on the platform.
When Rev. â¢ Dr. Hutchins called the
meeting to order he did so in the follow
ing words:
Members of the House of Deputies will please
come to order. The secretary will now call the
roll of the deputies.

The offertory was then' sung- ' arid ' con
sisted of Gounod's creation ""Unfold -Ye
Alaska needs ten more ordained missions;
Olympia six, Boise seven, California six. In
the whole eastern ' part of Oregon, twice the
size of the State of Maine, we have but six
clergymen. There are hundreds of Â¦â¢ square
miles where our Savior is as unknown as he is
in China. ' ' <
It is a crying shame. The spiritual condition
of these people is ' f earfuL '-
We must launch our nets and gather them
In â¢ at the command of our master. These
frivolous Questions of copes, miters, candles
and Incense are mere trifles when compared to
the mighty question I speak about. . We should
not waste time on these trifles and forget this
mighty question. Let us . not forget the mill-
Ions to whom we were commanded to "carry
the gospel of our Lord. ; . â¢ . â¢ -. - -
Of the slow progress of the church westward,
it was said in 1866 by Bishop Stevens: "How
much have we lost by the delay? While we
have hesitated others have pushed forward.
The children of our church have gone hungry
while we have held back." . :.
Our people in the East lack knowledge of
the chances for the growth of the church here.
The whole Western country north of California
is a terra incognita to the people of the East.
This Northwestern corner of our country is
usually Â¦ regarded as a very slow and back
ward country. I was ordained Just at the time
this country .was acquired by the United
States. Forty-five years ago there was not a
white settler in this Northwest country. The
hostile Indian had driven all the white, settlers
out. â¢
Is it any wonder that the progress of the
church in this district has been slow?
Oh, blessed master, when will the time come
when thy children, will lavish their strength
and money as the children of the world have
done to gather in their children, to bring thy
hosts to the kingdom of heaven?
It happens by an accident of years that he
Â¦wlio comes to be your preacher on this the
first occasion of your meeting on these distant
shores ot the PacMc is himself a resident of
this land. It is well known to all persons fa
miliar with the early history of the -.United
States that for long years the Western part
was little cared for and thought of beyond
Its being a haven for the savage and a profit
able hunting ground for the fur trader and
his employes. President Roosevelt, Daniel
Webster and Henry Clay, among many others,
have contributed to the literature on this
point. The two latter in their speeches in
Congress told the people what a desert land
this Western country was and how profitless
to the purposes of civilization. â¢
The purchase of Alaska was ridiculed. . It
was a most unpopular measure; referred to as
an unprofitable piece of speculation.
It is of this country, Alaska, that its Gov
ernor, Brady, says that it i has the greatest
latent richea of any State in the Union.
ing that you have come together here in this
far-off part of our country. It is the final
â¢object and end of everything that you say
and do.

The Flight of Time
The presiding officer then appointed the
Rev. Dr. Foute of San Francisco and
Deputy Fairbanks of Florida to convey
the message to the House of Bishops.
The Rev. Dr. Huntington of New York
presented a resolution that the reports
of the committee on constitutional
amendments be received this morning-,
but It was voted down by the acceptance
of a substitute offered by the Rev. Dr.
Fulton of Pennsylvania providing that the
committee on rules and order, when it
should be appointed, be requested to con
sider and report at Its earliest conve
nience the more important matters of
business now awaiting action at the
hands of the house, and report also the
order in which such matters might be
most conveniently disposed of by the or
ganization.
Considerable discussion then followed as
to the adoption of a resolution to fix the
hour at which the house should convene
each morning. Some of the deputies fa
vored meeting at 9 a. . m., while others
desired that the hour of 10 be selected.
A compromise was finally effected, and
the time for meeting 1 each morning will
be 9:30. The house will sit each day from
that hour until 1 p. m. and adjourn for
two hours. The afternoon sessions will
be from 3 p. m. until 5 p. m. V \
With the* adoption of the resolution fix
ing the daily hour of meeting' the conven
tion adjourned until this morning.
Gentlemen, brethren, have we not something
to do in this convention of 1901, this first con
vention of the new century? Let us then, I
beseech you, for I speak to you as my breth
ren and my friends, begin to-day a simple and
businesslike session, using the time, short or
long, with good common sense, with genuine
devotion and trying to make the best of our
time, in devising schemes and passing laws
which, like those passed by -our fathers and
which have come down to us through the cen
tury, shall reach into the coming century,
praying God that he may make us of one mind
in this house and may cause a right Judg
ment to be exercised in all things that we
shall do to Eet forward the safety, honor and
welfare of our church.
The Rev. Dr. Beatty of Kansas then
placed the name of the Rev. Dr. Hutch
ins in nomination for the office of secre
tary of the house, stating that he had
performed a similar office at the last two
conventions of the church. M. Fairbanks,
representing the Florida delegation, and
Major Hooper j'or the California deputies
heartily seconded the nomination, and the
assistant secretary, the Rev. Dr. Anstice,
was authorized to cast the ballot of the
house for the election of Dr. Hutchins.
A unanimous affirmative reply from the
entire house showed the popularity of Dr.
Hutchins.
At this point a message was presented
from the house of Bishops by its secre
tary, the Rev. Dr. Hart, announcing that
it had convened and elected the Bishop
of Kentucky as chairman and Dr. Hart
as secretary and that it was ready to
proceed to business.
Deputy Fairbanks of Florida moved
that a committee be appointed to Inform
the House of Bishops that the organiza
tion of the lower house had been perfect
ed and that it was also ready to proceed
with its work.
Then, further, when I remember again that
this is not a collection of self-seeking politi
cians, but an assemblage of churchmen, every
one loyal to his church, having come here, not
for his personal advancement or for the ad
vancement of any party with which he may be
affiliated, but in simple, supreme devotion to
that great church which we love and honor,
that every one intends to sink every personal
consideration in the great aim of advancing
this church. I feel certain that our delibera
tions will move on smoothly and rapidly.
Finally, there are some thoughts that ought
to be Inspiring to us. We have come for the
first time to this unique city, fresh and splen
did in its history and noble in its opportunities
and Us outlook. We are standing here near
the very spot where first the English service
was celebrated upon this continent of America,
and we ought to catch the spirit of this new
civilization and feel deeply desirous to do some
thing to contribute to the spiritual advancement
of this great community. We have just crossed
the American continent. We have seen many
of its magnificent cities, its great spaces of
country unoccupied by our church, and these
spaces little influenced, I am sorry to say, in
many instances by the authority of this church.
We want to see this church, by Its presence
and power, filling these cities and these spaces,
and making them powers for good in the moral
and religious regeneration of this country.
We are standing, many of us, upon the shores
of the Pacific Ocean for the first time. We
feel its waters rolling from California to far
Cathay 'and remember the new opportunities
that are opening to us, not only as American
citizens, but as American churchmen. And we
are Inspired with a deep desire to do what we
can in these directions. We are not only to
gird ourselves to meet the great problems of
this tontinent, but to do the Master's work
in these distant lands.
Yet there are considerations that give me a
cheerful courage when I remember the compo
sition of this house, as made up of Christian
gentlemen from-every part of the United States,
each one coming from some position of influ
ence, perhaps, In the different States or dio
ceses from which .they severally come. When
I remember that I feel perfectly certain that
they need little guidance from me, and much
further am I assured that their native courtesy
will always make it impossible for them to vio
late any of the amenities of life, and make it
certain that they will deport themselves in this
place just as Christian gentlemen ought always
to do. '
Gentlemen of the House of Clerical and Lay
Deputies: I have reached that time of life
when a man's most precious possession is the
affection and the confidence of his friends.
And to have the friends of my boyhood, with
whom I attended college, the friends of my
later life, who, when I went to Massachusetts
a stranger, took me into their hearts and their
homes, nominate me for this position and elect
me, 'without one thought or one word in regard
to It by myself, is an honor that appeals to
the best that is in me. And I am not ashamed
to say that I never was prouder in- my lift
than when it was announced that I had been
elected president of this' assembly.
I say it is an honor that any one may appre
ciate, when we consider the personnel of this
house, with the constituencies from which its
members come, the great church that they
represent, the splendid? questions that they must
consider and decide; surely the man whom such
a house elects as its president has a right to
feel that he has been honored indeed. And
then, when we remember the man who has
filled this chair during five successive conven
tions, a man of such distinguished presence,
of such exquisite dignity, of . such gracious
courtesy, of such pleasing humor, of such ad
mirable fairness, of such mature Judgmentâ
when we think of that ideal president, and
then I remember that I am to take his seat,
unworthy as I am, I appreciate yet more highly
the honor you have conferred upon me.
But, gentlemen, let me say frankly, it Is not
the honor that you have given me that I
chiefly feel; it Is the responsibility and the
difficulties of this high office. Therefore, as
you well know that parliamentary law is not
an exact science that any man can learn and
remember and apply easily, but is rather like
the bark of the growing tree that must adapt
itself as the tree advances from day to day
and year to year, and you and I here can make
precedents for ourselves, and we have made
precedentsâ therefore. I say, we will use every
moment as . best we may. and do quickly and
without any fear those things that ought to
be done, applying our common sense to the
various exigencies of legislation and so tran
sact the business committed to us by this
church.
The newly elected presiding officer was
called to the j:hair and In accepting the
honored office said: . .â¢ .-.. t
Expresses His Appreciation to the
. House of Deputies for Corj
ferring the Honor.

A meeting of the State Redwood Park
Commission was held yesterday after
noon, at which Rev. Father Kenna, "W. H.
Mills, Professor Dudley of Stanford Uni
versity and A. W. Foster were present.
Preliminary reports were received by the
Commissioners from the timber experts
who were employed to visit the Big Basin
the site of the proposed State park. TheÂ«e
were placed on file.
No action was taken toward acquiring
the lands that have been offered by the
B!g Basin Lumber Company to the State
for park purposes.
A discussion of the several matters con
nected with the general proposition took
place. According to one of the commls-
Bioners, speaking after the meeting the
possession of a part of Waddell Creek and
eome assurance concerning the preserva
tion of the watershed of that stream is
essential. There are comparatively worth
less lands needed to rectify the boun
daries to make the tract acceptable to the
State.

at the Harlem Track.
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â Yachting enthu
siasts and the general public are to-night
expecting a most exciting race to-morrow
between the Columbia and the Shamrock.
They base their high hopes on the strong
wind blowing to-night and which the local
weather prophets assert is likely to con
tinue for twenty-four hours or more. The
Washington Weather Bureau adds to the
i expectations which it is hoped will be
j realized by holding out a promise of a
I strong breeze off Sandy Hook. The bu
reau says:
"Fresh northwest winds and fair weath
er for to-morrow. The winds ought to
! hold good throughout the day." '
| The contest between the two yachts to
morrow will be over a thirty-mile trian
gular course, the same as that attempted
on Tuesday. It is the intention of the
committee to-night to sail the first leg
to windward, which will make -the other
two a broad reach and a close reach, pro
vided the wind does not shift.
At Sandy Hook to-night everything is
ready for to-morrow's race, and if the
weather predictions prove true the yachts
I will have -plenty of wind. At 10 o'clock
to-night the velocity of the wind was
thirty-six miles an hour.
Busy Day for Officials.
While it was a quiet day with the
yachts lying at the mooring inside Sandy
Hook, the officials of the New York
Yacht Club and the Royal Ulster Yacht
Club had a busy time of it complying
with the request of Sir Thomas lapton,
backed by the assent of E. D. Morgan
of the Columbia, that in future the races
should be had on consecutive days, not
counting Sunday. In addition there came
a request from George L. Watson, the de
signer of the Shamrock, for a remeasure
ment because of his intention to take out
ballast before to-morrow's race.
On the first proposition an agreement
was finally reached between the challenge
committees of the two clubs for a race
every day, but on the second Watson,
after further considering the matter, de
cided to let it drop, and the yacht will
sail to-morrow with exactly the same
amount of ballast which she has carried
I in previous races. This will not prevent
Watson from taking out ballast at any
time he may wish, which, of course, the
club is willing to have done at any time.
If, however, after to-morrow's race Wat
son decides to take out ballast it is prob
able that there will be no race on Friday,
as under the new arrangement either
yacht is at liberty to decline to race on
the next day. This will be seen in the
agreement, which was drawn up and
signed this afternoon and which is as fol
lows:
The agreement determining the conditions and
governing the races for the America's cup. as
agreed upon by the committees of the New
York Yacht 'Club and the Royal Ulster Yacht
Club, is hereby modified as follows:
Strike out clause beginning: "The first race
Ehall be sailed on Saturday, September 21, 1901,"
and substitute the following:
"The races shall be sailed on the following
dates until the series be completed, namely,
September 26, September 28, October 1 and Oc
tober 3, 19C1, and each following day except
Sunday; provided, however, that immediately
on the conclusion of the race of October 3 and
of each succeeding race, the regatta committee
shall inquire of each contestant whether he is
willing to start the next day, and should either
contestant reply in the negative one day shall
intervene before starting the day's race. The
Sunday shall not count as such intervening
day."
for the New York Yacht Club,
LEWIS T. CASS LEDYARD,
Chairman.
For the Royal Ulster Yacht Club,
R. G. SHARMAN CRAWFORD,
Chairman.
May Remove Ballast.
The proposition for a race on consecu
tive days came from Sir Thomas Lipton,
and as E. D. Morgan at once agreed two
representatives of the Royal Ulster Yacht
Club immediately sought Commodore
Ledyard of the New York YaÂ«ht Club,
Mr. Oddie and former Commodore E. M.
Brown. The matter was discussed fully
in Commodore Ledyard's office.
The agreement of two years ago was
gone over and a similar one finally drawn
and signed late in the afternoon.
About noon it was learned at the club
that those in charge of the Shamrock de
sired to shift some ballast, which, of
course, necessitated plans for remeasure
ments. Whether this plan of removing
ballast from the challenger was made
with a view of decreasing the stiffness of
the boat or cutting the waterllne the mat
ter of a few inches so as to gain in time
allowance could not be ascertained. Wat
son was at the club about 3 o'clock, but
found none of the officials in the building
and left immediately. He admitted, how
ever, that he proposed to take out ballast
from the Shamrock, but refused to make
any other statement regarding it. Under
her present measurement the Shamrock
allows the Columbia 43 seconds. Much of
this allowance was due to her great sail
plan, as her waterllne measurement is al
ready some inches shorter than the Co
lumbia's. It will be necessary for Wat
son to decrease the Shamrock's waterline
length by a foot in order to gain fifteen
seconds in time allowance, and although
the overhang of the challenger, both fore
and aft, is very long, it is thought that
considerable ballast will have to be taken
out in order to make a gain of even live
or six seconds. Still in races In which
neither boat seems to have the advantage
of more than a minute or two the matter
of five seconds might become very impor
tant.
At the time of the explosion at the stone
yards the lives of hundreds of persons In
neighboring houses were endangered.
They were saved only by the bad manner
In which the worV vraB handled. The dy
namiters tried to wreck the machinery in
the yards.
"That body is cf the man they called
Lou, and he lit the fuse at the stone
yards."
Brow's death adds a new phase of mvs
tery to the case. He arrived in Chicago
two days ago Buffering from severe in
juries to his lees. While being taken
home in the police ambulance he became
unconscious and died a few hours later.
The police are now investigating the
cause of his death.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2.â The funeral services
over the remains of Thomas Brow to-day
were interrupted in order that the body
â¢about to be buried might be identified as
that of one of the conspirators in the
wrecking by dynamite of the Heldmaier
& Edgeworth stone yards six weeks ago.
The identification will release an innocent
man who is at present locked up in the
County Jail charged with knowledge of
the crime.
Frank Hardy, who had turned State's
evidence, was taken to the Brow resi
dence to make the identification. He was
not told what was wanted of him and
he was led into the house where the
mourners and friends were gathered
about the coffin. Approaching the coffin,
Hardy was told to look upon the face of
The dead man. One glance and Hardy's
face turned white and he was visibly agi
tated. He said:

team to a surprise this afternoon in hold
ing the Elis down to a single touchdown
in a game of twelve and ten minute
halves. The Massachusetts men put up>
a remarkably aggressive game for tho
first of the season. Yale scored her touch
down in the first half by a series of short

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.. Oct. 2.â Harvard
defeated Bowdoin to-day In two twelve
minute halves, twelve to nothing, the
same score as last year. Harvard's back
field was composed of substitutes, and
only the excellence of the linemen saved
the day. Bowdoin's back was better than
Harvard's. The work of the Harvard
backs was so ragged that no end runs
could be tried. Campbell played at left
and showed all his oldtime form. Touch
downs were made by Derby and Swann
and the goals by Campbell.

Huggins, William C. Whitney's trainer,
said he considered that Reiff rode an ad
mirable and perfectly fair race.
Continuing, Reiff said: "I never bet on
horses, and I told the stewards so. I
made this explanation to them, but the
case was already decided against me.
One of the three stewards acted as prose
cutor as well as judge. It was no use to
argue. The whole business is the out
come of the hatred and jealousy of the
English trainers and jockeys to us Ameri
cans."
"Lester, rode as straight a race as I ever
saw," interposed Wishard, Richard Cro
ker's trainer. "I never saw a horse that
did not swerve at the Manchester bend,
as Reiff says."
"It's all a maze and a muddle. There
are no explanations. The stewards de
cided that I pulled, or at any rate rode a
crooked race on Delacey and let my
brother win on Minnie Dee. I have near
ly been at the top of the list this year
and was the leading jockey in 1900. I
have half as many mounts as some of
the crack jockeys, yet I ride more win
ners. To do more than this I would have
to ride the winner in every race. Yet
Lord Marcus Beresford declares 1 rode
crooked. I got away well on Delacey,
leading until he reached the bend to the
straight. It is a peculiarity of the Man
chester course that the leading horse al
ways goes wide four or. five feet or more
in turning in the straight. . Delacey did
this thing. Johnnie, seeing his chance,
shot through and got in. If I had closed
in again 1 should have put my brother
over the rail. All I could do was to keep
Delacey straight and ride like the devil to
win."
LONDON, , Oct. 2.â Lester Reiff, the
American jockey, whose license was with
drawn by the Jockey Club yesterday and
who', was warned off Newmarket Heath,
in an interview to-day on the subject
said:
The special boxing bouts at the Olympic
Club last night provided some sensational
boxing. There was no clean knockout,
but there was enough hard hitting to
supply several championship bouts.
J. J. Dukelow and William Kelly were
one brace of boxers who went to work
with a rush. Each had the other in dif
ficulty in the first round, both being
groggy at times. In the second they
fought all over the ring. Toward the end
of tne round Kelly had Dukelow in dis
tress. The third round was one of thÂ©
most sensational ever fought in the club.
Kelly was first to try ana then Dukelow
came back at him. Kelly waited awhile
and then buttered Dukelow all over the
ring. The last round was hammer ana
tongs throughout and It ;^emed Dukelow
1^
d \?f J. n LecnardÂ° a^Sanny Danziger met
last night for the third time Theymt
at it as though no love was lost between
them. Leonard started proceedings at a
lightning pace. He ripped his left to to
body and face and soon had Danziger
badiy cut about the eyes and mouth. In
the fourth round Leonard landed a left
hook which dazed Danziger. Leonard was
quick to see his advantage and rained,
blows on his opponent. Danziger fell to
his knees and remained .down four
seconds Leonard went after him viciously
and knocked him down again. Danziger
did not revive rapidly and Referee Smith
humanely stopped the fight and gave the
d j ClS FÂ° n McCarthy a an'd T. Wolfe went four
fast slugging rounds. They stood breast
to breast and never stopped. The judges
disagreed, one calling it a draw, the
other deciding in favor of Wolfe. Tho
referee ordered an extra round, but tho
club officials would not let McCarthy go
on, as It Is against the amateur interests
to fight more than four rounds. Referee
Smith accordingly gave the fight to W olf e.
C. Milward and W. Moreno were the
only heavyweights to hook up during the
evening. Moreno seemed to lack condi
tion He was knocked down repeatedly
in the second round and finally stayed
down until counted out.
R A. Stone defeated Joe Collins by
clean hitting and aggressive work.
J M. Lundie made a hurricane finish In
his' bout with T. Everett, thereby earning
the decision. .
â¢ The bout between Champion Britt and
D. Barry was the only disappointment.
Barry trembled so much from fear of his
opponent as to nearly shake his gloves off
his hands. He went down repeatedly
without being hit. Britt fought in his
usual fast, clever style. V^ "'\. y
The officials were: Judgesâ J. C. Wil
liamson and E. M. Graney: referee, E. J.
Smith; timekeeper. F. R. Butz; announcer.
G. A. Hensley. The affair was under tho
direction of Leader John A. Hammer

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Sufferers from this horrible malady
nearly always inherit it â not necessarily
from the parents, but may be from some
remote ancestor, for Cancer often runs
through several generations. This deadly
poison may lay dormant in the blood for
years, or pntil you reach middle life, then
the first little sore or ulcer makes its ap-
pearance â or a swollen gland in the
breast, or some other part of the body,
gives the first warning.
To cure Cancer thoroughly and perma-
nently all the poisonous virus must be
eliminated from the bloodâ every vestage
of it driven out. This S. S. S. does, and
is the only medicine that can reach deep-
seated, obstinate blood troubles like this.
When all the poison has been forced out
of the system the Cancer heals, and the
disease never returns.
Cancer begins often in a small way, as the
following letter from Mrs. Shirer shows :
A. small pimple came on my jaw about an inch
oelow the ear on the left side of my face. It gave
me no pain or inconven- * Â°
cince, and I should have .-aiS^jl^* 5^

CfCRISTT * WISE COMMISSION CO., Inc.the Brooklyn, Gives Testimony.
When Captain Sigsbee left the witness stand
he was succeeded by Lieutenant James J.
Doyle, vrho was watch officer on board Com
modore Sehley's flagship, the Brooklyn, dur-
lieutenant Doyle, Watch. Officer of
FIRST SCHLEY WITNESS.
"They were informal meetings to talk over
the situation. I remember I objected to one
because the Spaniards might come out anj
catch us out of our ships at any time, and
I wanted to go aboard my ship. The meeting
was broken up on my account."
Mr. Hanna handed to Captain Sigsbee a
press copybook containing the order to him
self in response to which he had proceeded
to Santiago to meet the flying squadron. The
dispatch read:
â¢â¢Proceed at once off Santiago. The Spanish
fleet If. reported there; communicate occasion
ally." - "
Captain Sigsbee eaid the dispatch was cor
rect. . . .
Captain Eigsbee was then recalled to cor
rect the official copy of his testimony of yes
terday, but before he proceeded Mr. Raynor
asked him whether, in view of the state of
the weather and the sea on May 26, ships could
have coaled with safety to them."
Captain Sigsbee replied: Â¦"Possibly, yes, on
the evening of the 26th, but at the risk of
danger to the ships. The weather had some
what abated and I cannot say that it would
have been impossible."
Captain Sigsbee also made an addition to his
statement of yesterday concerning any state
ment that he might have made to Admiral
Sampson or any one else, to the effect that
Commodore Schley was blockading Santiago
harbor twer.ty-flve miles out at sea. He said:
"I did not and never have stated that Ad
miral Schley was blockading twenty-five miles
out at sea."
The court asked questions of Captain Sigsbee
as follows:
"You have stated there were two meetings
of commanding officers off Santiago while you
were blockading there, have you not?"
'â¢Yes; I stated that to the beet of my recol
lection there were. I am not too firm In the
belief. I am positive of one."
"Upon what ship or ships were those meet-
Inge or this meeting held?"
"Either the Yale or the Harvard."
"Were the meetings accidental or by order
of the senior officer present?"
"By order of the senior officer present."
'"What was the object of these meetings?"
More Testimony About the Condition
of the Weather.
SIGSBKE IS RECAULED.
"Constantly."
"And owing to the many sen-ices and mis
sions of that sort she performed, :a It piotable
yen might have forgotten this?"
"It is always probable, possible also."
The court asked a number of questions, which
w*th responses were as follows:
"Were the positions t>f the Brooklyn and
Oregon relative to the Vixen during thÂ« battle
of July 3 taken from Lieutenant Harlow's
notes or from your personal observation?"
"From my recollection of the fight that <Tay."
"During the attack on the Colon May 31
could you see If the shots from the squadron
struck near the enemy?"
"I could not."
By the Court â What conversation, if any. had
you with Commodore Schley relating to the
object of the bombardment on May 81 while
you were taking him to the Massachusetts?"
"The only conversation I remember was that
relating to what should become of the Vixen
after the commodore left."
By the Court â What signals. If any, were
made by the Brooklyn from the commence
ment to the end of the battle on July 3?
"The Brooklyn had hoisted the signal:
'Enemy attempting: to escape"; that Is in the
notes. There may have been others, but I
do not find any here."
By the Courtâ State the orders under which
you acted when on blockade when off Santi
ago.
â¢'My impression is that I received my li.
etructions from Commander McCalla to go in
sWe the line of vessels and to the seaward
of Santiago about two miles. That is for the
29th, 30th and 31st of May."
"I do not, sir."
"About how was the ship heading at that
time within the quadrant of a circle south
ward to westward, northward to eastward?" Â¦
"We were headed at the beginning of the
battle inshore; that is to say, the head of our
ship was about north. As soon as the Spanish
ships came out and I got on top of the port tur
ret the ship was then moving ahead and turn
ing with port helm, because the Spanish ships
were a little on our starboard bow, but we
were working the port battery and started to
swing first and brought the port battery into
action. Now, then, we must have continued
around there, as I know, but when I was in
the starboard turret we lost sight of the ships
because they were on our port bow."
"The effect, then, of putting the helm aport.
In order io bring the starboard battery to bear,
would be to send the vessel through more than
ISO degrees, would it not, in turning?"
"Certainly, yes; we were headed about north
east and that would mean more than 180 de
crees." j .
"The cheaper way would have been to put
the helm to starboard, would it not?"
"I am not. prepared to say;"
"If the ship was headed northeast and the
chase wag going nearly west or a westward
course?"
."Yes, you could make the turn in that' way."
"Do you of your own knowledge know of any
thing to prevent your turning?"
"When I was on totj of the starboard turret
it looked very much to me as though we were
going to have a general melee or mix-up with
the Spanish ships." . '
"How far were they from you at that time?"
"When we took them up on the starboard
"Did you have an opportunity of observing
which way the vessel turned?" Captain Lemly
acked.
Witness responded in the affirmative. He
said, however, that he did not hear orders
given to the man at the wheel.
"What did you observe?"
"I observed while in the port turret that
we had an opportunity of tiring at the Spanish
ships and the turret was trained nearly ahead.
The Spanish ships were a little bit then on our
port bow and we lost sight of them by our
thlp turning with a starboard helm. Then
it was that the order was given to man the
starboard battery, and as I crossed from, one
turret to the other I observed the Spanish
ships a little bit on our starboard bow. As
scon as I got in that turret I swung the gun
sharp on the starboard bow. In the meantime
some of our own guns Tiafl fired, probably in
the forward eight-inch turret, so I could see
nothing at all for the dense smoke. 'While in
that position, and while the turret was being
trained, Mr. Mason, the executive officer,
passed down the starboard gangway, calling
'Sharp on the starboard quarter,' and I ac
cordingly trained the turret around and picked
the Spanish up on our starboard quarter, and
from then on It was a constant train of the
turret until we had the Spanish ships about
abeam." $
"What do you mean, exactly, when you say
the vessel turned the starboard helm?"
"She was then turning with a . starboard
helm, because that is the reason we lost sight
of the Spanish ships."
The witness then stated that the original en
try in the log had made it appear that the
helm was put to starboard instead of to port,
as it appears in the permanent log. The
change, he said, had been made on the 5th of
July, two days after the action.
Asked why he changed it, Mr. Doyle said:
"I changed it after I had had a discussion
with Sharp. I had been under the impression,
as I have stated, that we had turned with a
starboard helm. . Sharp was aboard the Brook
lyn on July 5 to luncheon with us and I had
a discussion with him that day on that sub
ject. I think that is the time I changed it."
"Do you know "whether the navigator had
then signed the log as correct?"
When the Brooklyn steamed westward wit
ness was first in the port turret and then in
the starboard turret.
Ing the Spanish war. There was much inter
est in his appearance, as he is the first of the
Brooklyn's officers to be called since the in
quiry began. He was called by the depart
ment, but when Captain Lemly had concluded
his examination Mr. Raynor announced that
it had been Admiral Sehley's intention to have
Lieutenant IJoyle summoned as a witness in
his behalf. He. therefore, with the consent of
the court, questioned the witness as if his ex
amination had been in chief and did not confine
himself to cross-examination.
In response to questions by Captain Lemly
Lieutenant Doyle said that during the battle
oft Santiago he had had charge of the two
waUt turrets. He had, he said, written the
log giving the account of the battle as there
recorded, but afterward an addenda had been
made by the navigator. *

Special Train Carries Engines to Al

Is Checked.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 2.â Fire that broke out
at 10 a. m. in the plant of the E. O. Stan
ard Milling Company on the river front
at Alton, 111., destroyed that and several
other buildings, causing a loss estimated
at $400,000. A high wind blew the sparks
broadcast, threatening the destruction of
the business section of Alton, and fat.
Louis Â¦was asked for relief. A special
train carried two engine companies from
here and they, with the local department,
finally got the flames under control at 1
o'clock.
The heaviest losers are the E. O. Stan
al'd Milling Company, three buildings, loss
J300.000, insured; Roller Milling Company,
loss $5000, partially insured; George
B. Hayden, machine shop, loss
$15,000, partially insured: Farmers' ele
vator, loss $25,000, partiallv Insured, and
the Model Hotel, loss $5000, partially in
sured. Five Bluff line freight cars loaded
with wheat, the freight house of the Dia
mond Joe steamship line and seven build
ings of minor importance were also
burned.
Marquis Ito spoke very feelingly of the
assassination of the President, and said
that it had caused much gloom among
Japanese, high and low.
The Senator was returning to the United
States on the transport Thomas when he
heard of President McKinley's death, and
hurried hither from Nagasaki on the
Kaga Maru.
"Political conditions in Japan were fast
approaching a satisfactory basis when I
left. The Seiyukai party, which is a par
ty of progress â a party formed of old and
new elementsâ was firmly molded before
I left, and much is looked for from it.
"Japan is now on friendly relations with
all the powers. Not even with Russia is
there a question likely to cause friction,
r.oi withstanding; the oft repeated rumors
to that effect. There was nothing new
when I left regarding Russia's move
ments in Korea and Manchuria, but it is
hardly likely that they would cause fric
tion between the two powers."
Regarding the report that Russia had
offered to take the Chinese fleet as part
payment of the indemnity, the Marquis
said he had not heard the report, but if
true it was hardly likely tnat Japan
would offer any objection.
Senator Beveridge of Indiana, who ac
companied the Marquis on the Kagra Maru
was returning lrom a trip across Siberia,
whither he went, he said, to study the
trade conditions and see what could be
done by the United States toward foster
ing trade with that great market, where
millions of dollars worth of goods could
be sold.
VICTORIA, B. C. Oct. 2.-The steamer
Kaga Slaru, which arrived here this
morning-, brought among her passengers
Marquis Ito, formerly Premier of Japan,
and Hon. K. Tsuzuko. who was Under
Secretary of Education in the Ito min
istry. A doctor and two secretaries ac
company the party. Marquis Ito said on
his arrival here that he had left Japan
on a pleasure trip to the United States
and Euroj e. and was out of politics.
"Xo, not foreverâ oh, no," he said. "It
is hardly likely that 1 will cease to give
my services to my country when needed.
My trip is taken solely in search of
health, but when a Japanese is abroad his
main thoughts are of Japan. If anything
is noted on my journey tnat will be of in
terest to Japan I will promptly send the
information home, and it is quite likely
that much information will be garnered
in the United Slates. Western affairs
have now begun to oc<upv a large share
of the attention, of the Orient.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"Absolutely," was the response.
"And the error," continued Mr. Raynor, "oc
curred, as I understand you to say, in this way:
That during the action you could not see on
account of the smoke and. thought the ship did
turn with starboard helm and entered It, so In
the log?"
"Yes," was the reply. "We lost track of the
enemy in the first Instance with the port bat
tery by our own bow shutting' the enemy out
and showing that at the time we must have had
our helm a little to starboard or that the enemy
was going with the starboard helm."
"And then when you learned you had been
mistaken you made the change?"
"I changed the entry and I think if you had
the rough copy here you would find it was
changed In my own handwriting."
Mr. Raynor then stated to the court that it
was his desire to treat Lieutenant Doyle as
a witness for Admiral Schley. To this the
court assented and Mr. Raynor asked the wit
ness a series of questions calculated to bring
out a brief history of the Brooklyn's part m
the Santiago campaign and a full statement
of his observations while an officer on board
that vessci.
Mr. Doyle said in response to these questions
that while at Key West, which port the Brook
lyn had left at the head of the flying squadron
on May 19, 1S98. he had heard nothing of the
Â¦ Spanish fleet nor had he then been informed
of a secret code of signals arranged by Cap
tain McCalla for communicating with the
Cuban insurgents.
Relating the particulars of the blockade off
Clenfuegos by the flying squadron from the
21st to the 24th of May, Lieutenant Doyle said
he had observed three lights which looked like
bonfires on shore each night that the squadron
lay off Cienfuegos, but that neither he nor
any on* else on board, so far as he knew,
understood their purport. He also told of a
reconnoissance of the harbor at Cienfuegos on
the evening of the 22d of May; of the conver
sation with the officers of the British ship
Adula and of the arrival of the Marblehead
and the departure of the entire squadron for
Santiago after the last named vessel had made
communication with the Cubans ashore.
Then, he said, on the night of May 24, the
ships formed in squadron and started eastward,
the speed at first being nine.. -knots an hour,
but afterward being reduced to accommodate
the smaller vessels, the Vixen and Eagle.
When they started there was quite a surf,
a "long swell of the sea," and on the 25th
the weather was still worse, making. It very
difficult for the yachts to keep up.
Lieutenant Doyle placed the distance of the
American fleet oft Santiago from the mouth
of the harbor at from four to five miles, and
said there were picket' boats on the insiue
of the line. .
Speaking of ' the bombardment of the Colon
on the 31st of May, he designated it as a
r^connoissance and said that its effect had
been to develop the fact that the Spanish had
two guns in their land batteries.
Mr. Raynor asked â "When was the circular
form of blockade commenced?"
While no mention was made of the name of
Admiral Sampson, this question wa^ evidently
regarded as an attempt to bring his blockade
into the case for the purpose of comparison and
Captain Lemly was prompt in noting a vig
orous objection.
Without waiting for any argument on the
point the court immediately announced a brief
recess. The members retired for a minute
or two, and when they returned Admiral Dew
ey said: *
"The court "decides that all questions relat
ing to the blockade off Santiago must be con
fined to the time prior to the arrival of the
commander-ln-chief."
The court then adjourned for the day.
quarter after, we made part of the turn, as I
remember the range, it was 1400 yards."
"How do you verify that range?"
"I have no way of verifying that. We had
to take the range given to us."
."What I mean by verifying is as to whether
or not shots were fired at that range and how
they fell?"
"I fired at that range. I fired one I know."
Mr. Haynor then took the witness and asked
him if it were not true that the change in the
log was due to an error on the part of the wit
ness and to no desire on the part of anybody
to falsify tbe facts.
LONDON, Oct. 2.â Lord Kitchener to
day reports that two officers and thirty
one men have been killed in an attack
made on Colonel Kekewich's camp at
Moedwill. The Boers, who were under
Commandants Delarey and Kemp, had
fourteen officers and 114 men wounded
after two hours' fighting, when the Boers
were driven off. Colonel Kekewich was
among the wounded.
The Boer reverse at Moedwill occurred
September 28. The Boers are reported
to have been 1000 strong. Lord Kitchener
in his dispatch says the British repelled
the attack with great vigor. Colonel
Kekewich was slightly wounded in two
places. He* says that all . ranks . behaved
extremely well. The wounded, were taken ,
to Rustenburg, half way between Pre
toria and ,Mafeking. . : :.j. ' a ' ' . ' ' .

A PESTIFEROUS GERM.
Burrows Up the Scalp Into DandrutE
and Saps the Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair as
a rule do not know that it is the result
of dandruff, which is caused by a pesti-
ferous parasite burrowing up the scalp as
it digs down to the sheath in which the
hair is fed in the scalp. Before long the
hair root is shriveled up and the hair
drops out. If the work of the germ is not
destroyed hair keeps thinning till bald-
ness comes. â¢ The only way to cure dan-
druff Is to kill the germ, and until now
there has been no hair preparation that
would do it; but to-day dandruff is easily
eradicated by Newbro's Herpicide, which
makes hair glossy and soft as silk.

GRAPE-NUTS.
BOXES OF GOLD.
Sent for Letters About Grape-HTut3.
S3 1 ) boxes of gold and greenbacks will be
sent to persons writing interesting and
truthful letters a.bout the g-ood that has
been done them by the use of Grape-Nuts
food.
10 little boxes, each containing a $10
gold piece, will be sent the 10 writers of
the most Interesting letters.
20 boxes, each containing a $5 gold piece,
to the 29 next most interesting writers,
and a $1 greenback will go to each of the
S00 next best. A committee of three, not
members of the Postum. Co., will make
decision between December 1 and 10, 190L
Write plain, sensible letters, giving de-
tailed facts of 111 health caused from im-
proper food, and explain the improvement,
the gain in strength, in Â¦weight, or in brain
power afier using Grape-Xuts food.
It is a profound fact that most ails of
humanity come from improper and non-
nourishing food, such as white bread, hot
biscuit, starchy and uncooked cereals, etc.
A change to perfectly cooked, predigest-
ed fr>od like Grape-Nuts, scientifically
made and containing exactly the elements
r.ature requires for building the delicate
and wonderful cells of brain and body,
will quickly change a half sick person to
a well person. Food, good food, is Na-
ture's strongest weapon of defense.
Include in the letter the true names and
addresses, carefully written, of 20 persons
r.ot \ery well, to whom we can write re-
KmiOJag the food cure by Grape-Nuts.
Almost every one interested in pure food
is willing to have his or her name appear
in ihe papers for such help as they may
offer the human race. A request, however,
to omit name will be respected. Try for
one of the 330 prizes. Every one has an
f-Qual show. Don't write poetry, but just
honest and interesting facts about the
good you have obtained from the pure
food Grape-Nuts. If a roan or woman has
found a true way to get well and keep
well, it should be a pleasure to stretch
a helping hand to humanity by telling the
facts.
Write your name and address plainly on
ie:ter and mail promptly to the Postum

bears in the wheat pit at the opening to
day. December started %@%c Â¦ lower at' 63%Â®
69c and at the outset there was more of the

but later in the session a drive by a small
bear clique depressed December to 68^c. De
cember closed ViÂ®%c under yesterday at

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Chicago was more active and
steady, though the bears were still pressing.
There was no special support, however. The
cash demand was rather better. It was stated
that France would need very little Wheat be
fore spring, and that the French have actually
been reselling all the Wheat they bought early
in the year. Beerbohm cabled that free Ameri
can receipts and cheap offerings from Russia
have weakened the English market. Minnea
polis reported a good domestic demand for
Flour, but not much doing for export.
This market continued quiet, with a further
weakening in futures.

Provisions.
In view of the continued decline In' pork prod
ucts at Chicago local dealers -now think that
possibly Hams may not advance after all. The

Currants, Raisins, Prunes, Nuts.
Mall advices from New York say: "Trade
on spot continues dull and featureless, but a
Tery fair business Is doing in new crop fruits
nuts for future delivery. Naturally, cur
rants attract most attention, the first direct
jszeamer, the U&nim, now being due. A con
siderable portion of her cargo has been sold
to arrive to cleaners and Jobbers at prices
considerably above the present range. Ama-
Xias, per this vessel, now offer at 6%<g6^4c
according to holder, while goods on the Mel
vllle, the next direct steamer, are quoted at
Â»ic lesÂ«. A fair business is doing In currants
liy both vessels, but orders are mostly for
eicsll lots. New currants on spot were quoted
st 7 : *c, with a. light demand for immediate
requirements. The Greek market was reported
elightly higher, particularly for the better
frades.
"New Valencia layer raisins are meeting
With moderate sale at 7%@7%c on spot, ac
cording: to bolder, and supplies are temporarily
not heavy. A further quantity of Valencia:*,
due on the Manim, Is offering at 7c. New
Smyrna figs are dull. Prices are nominally
unchanged at 8%@12c for layers. There will
be Bold to-morrow 500 cases new layers and
tfGO new crop hags and the prices then realized
will establish the market.
"The raisin situation in California is firmer,
cffering-6 at the moment being few. Prunes
are held steady at a 3%c basis for^Santa
Claras. .A single car of 40-50s, 50-60s and 60-70s,
it is understood, -was sold recently at a 3c
basis, with bids for a number of other care
at the same figure turned down.
"Very little business has been done in the
local market in new California walnuts, the
price being too high as against the prices
ior foreign nuts. New Grenobles, for de
livery about November -U5, are having fair
eale around lOHglO^jc. Ivica almonds, on the
ex>ot, are %c lower at 10%c."
The Lumber Trade.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says: "The
tragic death of President McKinley naturally
bad a depressing influence last month upon
all trade, and the lumber market for at least
fcalf of the month was listless and depressed.
The strike of the teamsters and longshoremen
sJfo affected it. but the action of the Manu
facturers' Association in securing a vessel
end housing and feeding new men broke the
effect of the strike and as fast as possible
vessels were unloaded and sent to sea again.
The effect of this good work is seen In the
Increased receipts of lumber over last month.
"Prices have been somewhat firmer than
usual at this season of the year and carl
rates have been generally maintained. As
coon as the labor excitement is over it is ex
rected that building will be far more active.
'She usual talk of extending trade to East
ern and foreign markets is now being in
dulged in, but no great improvement can be
looked for until the mill owners devise some
plan by which orders from outside States can
be promptly tilled.
"Redwood and mountain pine will find a
ready market In the East when It becomes
known that all sizes can be obtained in
large quantities. Eastern buyers long siftce
tÂ«camÂ« disgusted with having their orders
(shelved, with the explanation that no mill
could fill the orders. This should not be so.
Arrangements should be made by which a
stock of dry lumber could be kept on hand
ready for . delivery at a moment's notice.
When this is done Eastern architects and
builders, kno-wing that their orders can and
will be. filled, will pay some attention to Cal
ifornia' lumber."

NEW TORK, Oct. 2.â The market started
out to-day with an upward rush. Apparently
the professional traders were Impressed with
the . idea that the statement of net earnings
officially promulgated last evening as the
market closed by the president of the United
States Steel Corporation -would have . a
strengthening influence on the whole list.
There was quite an active demand for a while
for United States Steel, which lifted the price
1% over yesterday. Colorado Fuel and Ten
nessee Coal showed some strength on the as
sumption that the favorable conditions in the
trade revealed by the statement of steel cor
poration earnings â¢ would benefit these com-'
panies also. The railroad list was affected
by a demand from the shorts, but the force
of the demand spent itself early and the mar
ket rell into dullness and heaviness, punctu
ated by a number of weak spots among the
industrials. The friends of United States Steel
were inclined to attribute this weakness to
the contrast afforded with the policy of that
company In the publication of its earnings,
but the United States Steel securities fell back
with the rest of the market and the profes
sional speculative^ sentiment in the street
failed apparently to be impressed with the
new policy of the United States Steel Corfjora
tion as an epoch-making departure. The large
profits reported by that company had some
reassuring effect nevertheless, owing to the
wide-reaching importance attached to pros
perous conditions in the iron and steel in
dustry. The American Car stock, the Pressed
Steel stocks. Glucose and National Salt were
notably affected, losing from 2% to 4 points.
Brooklyn Transit continued weak under pres
sure of liquidation. The stock fell an extreme
4H to below 60, the lowest price of the year.
Manhattan 2%, partly In sympathy. The level
of prices generally was carried below last
night, but new declines did not reach a point
in important railroad stocks except for Mis
souri Pacific. The money market continued
strong and sterling exchange advanced again.
Covering of shorts rallied the market slightly
and It closed about steady.
Railroad bonds were dull and irregular.
Total ealeE, par value, $1,605,000.
United States old 4s declined U. 3s and 5s
% and the new 4s 1 per cent on the last call.

The asking price for. Australian coal cargoes

branches. Its general use may eventually- cause
an advance in price and may check its consump

POLICE WILL SUMMON
' THE WITTMAN JURY
Judge Seavrell Decides That Sheriff Is
Not Proper Officer to Serve
Summons.
The order issued by Police Judge Ca
baniss directing the Sheriff to summon a
jury to try Captain Wittman on a charge
of battery was) annulled by Judge Sea
well yesterday. The decision was ren
dered on a writ; of review.
Judge Seawell in his decision states that
in respect to the proposed trial the peti
tion must be denied for the reason that in
a proceeding of this character he could
only review the proceedings which have
already taken place and that he had no
power to prohibit future action.
The court further holds:
"That the Sheriff is not required to at-:
tend any police court in the State. The
Political Code provides that the Sheriff
rnust attend all courts, except Justices',
Probate and Police courts held within his
county. The charter provides that the
Chief of Police shall appoint one or more
public officers to attend the, sessions of
the Police Court to preserve order and ex
ecute the orders of the court."

Foote lately reached Balangiga, the scene
of the disaster to Company C, Ninth In

five Americans unburied, including that
of Captain Connell, who was bound with
rcpes and partly burned. The Filipinos
had carefully buried the bodies of their
countrymen killed in the fighting. The

the Americans. Three companies of Maca

Business Agent Wisler of the machin

opinion upon the settlement of the team

"I have not yet ascertained just what
the terms of agreement between the
teamsters and draymen are, and until I
know the precise status of affairs I ha\e

"Is it true that the Governor is interest

Members of the Mechanics' Institute
met last night to discuss the proposition
to sell the pavilion embracing the
block bounded by Larkln, Hayes, Polk
and; Grove streets, to the city for the
Caniegie library. Mayor Phelan appeared
on y behalf of the municipality and urged
that $â¬00,COO be fixed as the price.
A report from three real estate experts
was read in which this figure was named.
This was without consideration or the
value of the buildings on the site, w^hich
it was understood the Mechanics' Institute
would have the right to remove or dis
pose of, as was best seen fit. A vote was
taken and the proposition rejected by
twenty-seven to forty-nine votes.
Â¦ After a long discussion a valuation of
$750,000 was placed upon the property, and
by a vote of sixty-four to five it was de
cided to sell the property to the city at
that figure if -possible. The matter now
will come up for consideration before. the

DRAYMEN TAKE ACTION.
Association Indorses Settlement With
the Teamsters.
The settlement -of the teamsters' strike
was the main faiibject of discussion at the
meeting of the Draymen's Association in
the Alcazar building last night. The news
at this event spread rapidly, and when
the meeting wÂ»s called to order by Chair
man Tilden at 8:S0 o'clock the hall was
( rowfled almost to suffocation.
Manager Renr.er reported the result of
the conference with Governor Gage dur
ing the afternoon, at which the terms of
settlement of the strike were arrived at.
It was agreed by both sides that the
teamsters could go back to their trucks
on the conditions outlined by the associa
tion on August 30, which were at that
lime refufcea by the teamsters, or rather
iheir leaders.
"It was understood." said Renner. "that
ne would not discriminate against union
rnen in the matter of giving them em
ployment. Neither were we to discrim
inate against -ion-union men. It was fur
ther agreed that there would be no modi
fication of wages for one year. TMe
schedule in force at the time the strike
v/as Inaugurated was accepted by the
teamsters."
The report W3s received with applause
by the dravmen. The announcement was
then made by Chairman Tilden that every
drayman was empowered to do as he
pleased in the matter of taking back his
old teamsters. L'nder the terms of settle
ment it was understood that the draymen
bhculd treat with their men on independ
ent lines, the same, as if there were no
teamsters' union in existence. The dray
men were urged to accept the result with
out exhibiting signs of satisfaction over
what they might deem to be a victory.
The terms of settlement were approved
by the association, and the action of the
executive committee in arriving at a set
tlement of the strike was indorsed with
cheers. The meeting then adjourned.
Manager Renner said after the meeting
that the draymen were more than satis
fied with the terms of the settlement. He
admitted that the terms were substantially
the same at- were offered to and rejected
by the strike Jeaders a month ago. These
w<vre that theiv should be no reduction in
wages for one year; that there should be
no discrimination against the men, be
they non-union or otherwise; that the
draymen treat directly with their em
ployes and not with the union; that the
men agree to work with such non-union
drivers as may be retained by the dray
men without offering to mokst them in
any particular, and that the wage sched
ule shall be the same as was In force
prior to the inauguration of the strike.
Chairman Tilden made a similar state
ment. He added that the terms were per
fectly satisfactory to both sides and that
they would be strictly carried out. He ex
pressed gratification at the result of the
peace negotiations, which would prove of
vsiue not only to the teamsters and dray
men, but to the general public as well.
MACHINISTS ABE JOYFUL.
Ne-ws of Settlement of Teamsters'
Strike Received With Applause.
The tffc-ct of the settlement of the
i^amsters* strike was plainly manifest at
in<s meeting of the Machinists' Union last
OAKLAND, Oct. 2.-lIies Agnes S. |
Adams, eyewitness of the trag
edy that resulted in the death of
Dr. John G. Jessup at the hand/3
of her father, Charles G. Adams,
the unfrocked Episcopal clergyman, told
the story of the affair to the jury sitting
In the trial in Judge Melvin's court to
day. Again the tale of that tragic night
last June, when Dr. Jessup was shot
down, was related in all its -detailsâ Dr. '
Jessup's meeting with Miss Adams, his <
wild rush up the stairs of the Adams ;
home, Miss Adams' effort to dissuade him :
from his rash attempt, his standing in ;
front of the door and saying to Adams, j
"Now shoot me if you dare"; the shot
ringing out from Adams' pistol, the vic
tim's attack on the murderer, the inno
cent cause of it all. helping the wounded
man, dawn- the stairs and upon the ver~ c
anda to the fresh airâ all this was told by
the daughter of the man who is on trial
for his life.
Miss Adams spent almost the entire day
in the witness chair. She will spend an
other- day there to-morrow. She stood
the ordeal well. The cynosure of many
eyes, she did not quaver before them and
delivered her answers without a falter.
When she testified at the Coroner's in
quest and the preliminary examination
she was so troubled with a throat affec
tion that her voice was hardly audiW 1 ?
and the court attaches and reporters had
to gather close around her in order to
catch the words, but tc-day she spoke in
a voice so firm and distinct that she could
be - hÂ»ard from" almost any part of tho
courtroom. Mies Adams' face is not as
pallid ea !t was at her two previous ap
pearances before the public and her de
meanor was brighter. She even smiled at
the questions and the answers she was
compelled to give.
Miss Adams' Testimony Strengthened
The testimony given by Miss Adams in
relating the story of the tragedy at her
home in Berkeley was stronger in a de
gree than that given by her at the pre
liminary examination. She put emphasis
on the part of the story which had refer
ence to Dr. Jessup's manner at the time
he entered the house and the efforts she
made to keep him from going up the
stairs. For instance, at the preliminary
SLAIN TROOPS'
BODIES FOUND
I examination she said the deceased was
I not excited: to-day she said he was con
siderably so. When presented with the
transcript of the testimony she had to
admit the changes. The prosecution made
Miss Adams its witness this morning and
immediately after the prosecution fin
ished the defense called her as its wit
ness.
"Where do you live?" was the first ques
tion asked of Miss Adams by District At
torney Allen.
| "In San Francisco," was the reply.
â¢ Miss Adams has been living In San
| Francisco since the shooting.
i "What time did you meet Dr. Jessup
on the day this shooting affair took place-
June 17, 1001?" asked the District Attor
ney.
"About 7:30 in the evening."
"Did you enter the house together?"
"Yes."
"Did anything occur after you went In?"
"Yes." : â¢
"Well, will you please state to thecourt
and jury just what occurred on that oc
casion?"
"Now Shoot, if You Dare."
"I stepped inside the door and Dr. Jes
sup followed me. Father asked, 'Who is
that?' and Dr. Jessup said 'It Is I. I want
you to stop abusing this girl!' Father
shouted down, 'Don't Â¦ come up or I'll
shoot; I'm dangerous.' Dr. Jessup said,
'I'll come up, if I have business to come
up,' and started up the stairs. I told
him not to go upstairs, but he said, 'He'll
never shoot,' and continued up the stairs.
After golngitwo or three steps he stopped
and disengaged my hands from his coat,
to which I was holding on. When he
reached almost to the top of the stairs he
stopped again, and taking off his coat
hung it on the newel post.
"Dr. Jessup was very pale and excited.
; He stood in front of the door with his
I arms stretched out and said, 'Now shoot
if you dare.' Father was lying on the bed
in the west bedroom. He raised his head
and the revolver at the same time and
fired one shot. Dr. Jessup staggered back
against the balustrade and then rushed
Into the room again and attacked father
He beat father over the-head with the re
volver, which ho took away from him
"I asked Dr. Jessup if he was hurt and
he tald he was. He wanted me to stay
away from him as he was covered with
blood, but I took him by the arm and
helped him downstairs. He said he want
j cd to be taken out In the fresh air and
I with reference to a settlement of the
strike." I
Inquiry ' among the machinists devel
oped a strong sentiment in favor of a bct
tlement of their dispute in some honor
able way. The men do not disguise the
fact that they are in financial distress
and that they would gladly welcome an
adjustment of their strike. The recent
defection of a number of their men ha*
had the effect of spreading the feeling of
discontent which prevails in the ranks,
and the news of >he settlement of the
teamsters' strikeMvill, in the opinion of
many, have the effect of precipitating a
crisis in the affairs of the machinists.
STUDENTS OF STANFORD
VOTE ON AMENDMENTS
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 2. -
The five amendments to the constitution
of the Associated Students, which were
submitted by the executive committee of
the student body, were voted on by the
students at a meeting this afternoon. The
first for.r passed, but the fifth, providins
that the executive committee have the
power to remove officials of the Associ
ated Students, failed.
The first amendment provides that tha
president of the university shall have the
power to remove any student officer who
commits a breach of university discip
line or who fails to meet scholarship or
other requirements. The second requires
the treasurer of the Associated Students
to rile his bond of $5000. or more, not later
than throe weeks after his election. The
third and fourth amendments provide that
officers shall assume their duties at the
end of the semester In which they are
elected and that members of the execu
tive committee must be given notice of a
meeting before it is held.
The principal aim of the amendments is
to prevent any further difficulty between
the faculty and student officials, such as
has lately occurred in the case of Treas
urer Nourse. The passing of the first
amendment was made by the faculty a
condition precedent to their ratifying tn<j
election of Harry Edwards as success jr
to Nourse. As it was necessary to have a
treasurer immediately the executive com
mittee agreed to the requirement.

Her Testimony Stronger in Favor
of Father Than at the
Coroner's Inquest
"No. He was a large, powerful man,"
was the reply.
"Did your father say anything to Dr.
Jessup while he was being beaten with
the revolver?"
"He said, 'Keep on.' "
At this juncture Juror Thomas White of
Alarneda asked the court's permission to
ask a question, which was- given him.
"What business had Dr. Jessup there
at your house that night?"
"I sent for him."
"Were you afraid of your father?"
"No; I disliked going into the house
alone."
"Why did you go?"
"To get father something to eat.'
Miss Adams' testimony for the prosecu
tion was finished shortly after the court
convened after the noon recess. The.de
fense began immediately to put In Its
case. Attorney Church made the opening
statement for his side. He said in part:
In behalf of the defendant testimony v.-lll bÂ«
offered confirming the inferences you have al
ready no doubt adduced from the examination
upon your qualifications as Jurors. We propose
to show that the deceased went to the house
of the defendant to offer him violence. We will
1 offer testimony of witnesses for the purpose of
showing- that the deceased uttered threats
against the life and person of thi3 defendant,
before this shooting took place; that he said
he would break his head. We will show that
j the accused was justified in shooting down the
I deceased.
Suffered From Delirium Tremens.
We will show that at the time of thi3 shoot
ing the condition of the defendant waa such
that he was not responsible for hi3 acts under
the law. We will show that he became ad
dicted to drink; that he was a minister o* the
Episcopal church; that he was a man of edu :
cation; that two years ago he had an attack
of the deHrum tremens and that he has been
detained in an asylum because of his habits;
that on the Saturday previous tp the shooting
of Dr. Jessup he suffered an attack of delirum
tremens and that he was drunk at the timn
he committed this crime. ;' : *V
Miss Adams was the first witness called by
the defense. In answer to the first question
she said she was 22 years of age.
"When did your father begin using alcoholic
liquors?" was asked.
"In 1S88. when he was rector of an Episcopal
church in Southport. Conn.," was the reply.
"Of what schools or colleges Is your father
a graduate?"
"Baxter Hall, an Episcopal seminary; Cam
bria College in Ohio, and Columbia College,
New York."
"How long did you stay In Southport?"
"Until -the fall of 1890, when we went to
Mount Vernon. N. Y.. my father having re
signed the Southport parish. We stayed there
a year and then went to New York, where
father had chajge of St. Mark's Memorial
Chapel for awhile. Afterward he had charge
of the Church of the Intercession and at the
same town he conducted a towel business."
Tries to Jump From Window.
"Did your father continue to drink alcoholic
liquors to excess in those places?"
"Yes as the years went by he drank much
harder." He was almost continuously Intoxi
cated in New York."
"Was he ever drunk In the pulpit?
"Yes he was often intoxicated at St. Mark's.
He would become very excited while preach

afternoon. Judge Melvin announcing that
as Miss Adams had been on the stand all
day she was in need of a rest. The case
was therefore continued until to-morrow

STOCKTON. Oct. 2.â The case cf Cap
tain William Bruce, formerly of Company
B. National Guard of California, court
martialed on a charge of a misappropria
tion of company funds, was concluded
this afternoon and the court announced
that judgment would be rendered en the
12th inst.
Colonel Hay gave the most damaging
testimony against the accused. He said
that in October last he was appointed \.o
inspect the - local companies.. He ga\"e
Captain Bruce notice of his coming, but
the captain failed to appear on the day
Â¦et. He did appear, however, in the even
ing- at the inspection of the company.
Colonel Hay then made an appointment
Â¦with Captain Bruce for a day in Novem
ber, and again Captain Bruce was absent.
On January io Colonel Hay came to
Stockton and discovered that Captain
Bruce was short nearly $1400 of the
cmoum of money he should have had on
hand. Captain Bruce stated that he had
rhe money at his -houfce, but did not like
to bring it through the streets .at so late
an hour at night. Accordingly Colontl
Hay made an appointment with the cap
tain for io o'clock the next day. Captain
Bruce cr.me and said the money was
locked up in his father-in-law's safe and
he would have to await his relative's rt
turn at noon vrith the key. An acoolnt
ment was made for 'J. o'clock in the after
noon, but Captain Bruce did not keep it.
Captain Bruce took the stand and ad
mitted that his reports of the balances
of moneys on hand had been false. He
said he had spent all of the money re
ceived In the interests of the National
Guard. He said much of the money was
spent In providing refreshments and
amusements to keep the bo'-s of the com
pany interested and obtain their attend
ance ftt drills.
At this stage the judge advocate offered
to admit it as a fact that the accused had
spent all the money received for the good
cf the company. The court went into ex
ecutive session and refused to receive the
admission.
GENERAL STRIKE ENDS.
Continued From Page Two.
HONOLULU, Sept. 27, via Victoria, B.
C, Oct. 2.â The First Circuit and the Su
perior Court of the Territory had anoth
er clash last Friday. As a result the
bailiff of the Supreme Court and the bail
iff of the Grand Jury of the Circuit Court
had a physical encounter outside the
room occupied by the Grand Jury, the two
officers meeting in efforts to carry out the
orders given them.
The cause of the trouble this time was
the occupancy of the chambers of Chief
Justice Frear, who is absent, by the
Grand Jury. The room formerly occupied
by the jury was too small, and Deputy
Attorney General Davis asked Judge Gear
for a better room, proposing to use
Krear's room. Gear stated that he had
no authority to order the jury to occupy
Frear's room, but that the jurors could
do bo if they wished. Davis at once se
cured the keys and the jury began to use
the room.
On Friday morning Associate Justlca
Perry, the only member of the Supreme
Court who is in the city now, ordered
Bailiff McGurn to take possession of the
room and exclude the Grand Jury. He
took the position that it was an out
rageous invasion of Frear's private office
for the Grand Jury to enter the room.
When McGurn started to unlock the door
of the room he was resisted by Bailiff
Noy of the Grand Jury. He overpowered
Noy, and then Judge Gear himself of the
First Circuit Court, wha had been at
tracted by the noise, stood guard at the
door of the Giand Jury's quarters and
defied the Supreme Court bailiff to oust
him. The bailiif was just about to do so
when Justice Perry stopped him. '
The Department of Public Works
authorized the use of the room, and it 19
still being used. An order signed by
Judge Gear is on the dor ordering all
persons except those entitled to enter the
room to keep out, as the Grand Jury's
private papers are in the room.

THEIR SCIENTIFIC EVOLUTION.
lalt Breakfast Food
The Highest, Type..
The evolution of breakfast cereal*
makes a most interesting study. The
origin was" undoubtedly in "bonnle Scot-
land." where so many things that ha"s
added to the brain and brawn of the world
have had their birth. Scotch "parritch."
as their oatmeal porridge was called, wa3
the daily breakfast of most Scotch fami-
lies of whatever rank.
The most important part of this evolu-
tion, however, was reserved for the time
when a practical manufacturer realized -
the Importance of the suggestions of ex-
perts concerning the use of maljt In con-
nection with cereals. After many years
of experiment a practical method of
manufacture was devised and the result
was given to the world as Malt Breakfast
Food. This food, with its peculiarly de-
licious flavor.' its great nutritive proper-
. ties. Its adaptability for the digestion of
either weak or strong people, has become
the favorite breakfast food with old and
i young, the athlete and the invalid.THE " SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1901

With Mismanaging Funds Held
in Trust for Her.
Mr3. Mary Bruning filed a complaint In
the County Clerk's office yesterday in
which she alleges that Attorney E. Myron
Wolf, while acting as trustee of her
estate, mismanaged the same and is
guilty of fraud and dishonesty.
Attorney Wolf was appointed. Mrs.
Bruning*s guardian when she was de
clared insane three years ago and sent to
the Stockton Asylum. She possessed at
that time $11,500, and the money was
turned over to Wolf to be held in trust
for her.
Last July Mrs. Brunlng was restored to
capacity by Judge Carroll Coofc, and Wolf
was relieved of his duties as guardian,
but retained as trustee. He ls still in
charge of the plaintiff's funds. At the
time Judge Cook declared Mrs. Brunins
sane it wasfctlpulated that she was not to
be given control of her property. Judge
Cook directed Wolf to pay her an allow
ance of $50 monthly.
At the time of her commitment to tha
insane asylum her property was in the
possession of Miss Hulda Thompson, and
a legal battle was necessary before it
could be recovered. W. L. Pierce was the
attorney for Wolf and succeeded in re
gaining the money, which amounted to
511,500. For his services he put in a claim
for $3SpO, which' was paid by order of court.
In the complaint filed yesterday Mrs.
Bruning alleges that Wolf conspired with
Pierce to defraud her. She further alleges
that Wolf approved her restoration to
capacity in order that he might retain
control of her property.
The complaint alleges still further that
the claims allowed for expert medical
testimony and other lawyers' fees were
unnecessary.
Attorney Wolf said last night: "In my
opinion Mrs. Binning is still mentally un
balanced. Her charges against me have
grown out of her vagaries. She has
always imagined that she uas the victim
of a conspiracy. No later than three
weeks ago she came to my office and' by
her conversation showed that she was far
from beins sane. So far as I am con
cerned every cent I expended was paid
out on an order of court. I can say that
her charges will prove groundless when
the suit is heard."
VEBBICT OF HTJRTJER
IN STANTON INQITEST
Witnesses Before the Coroner Tall tb.e
Story of Tragic Minna-Street
Deed.
The Coroner's jury yesterday returned a

shots fired before he looked out of his
window. Then he saw Stanton lying- on
the sidewalk and Dunphy. standing over
h'm. fire three more shots at the wounded
man. Then Dunphy. drawing a second
revolver from his pocket, fired three more
shots Into the body of his victim.
M. " J. Fay, a grocer, residing at 419 Min
na street, told about Dunphy asking him
several days prior to the murder to find
out the whereabouts of Stanton, saying:
he wanted to get even with Stanton for
having robbed him of some money when
they were rooming together. After the
shooting the witness met Dunphy at the
door of the grocery with a pistol In his
hand, and Dunphy said, "I have got my
man."
Police Officer R. E. Silver told about
the arrest of Dunphy with two revolvers
in his hand and of the confession made by
the prisoner.
Dunphy was represented by Attorney
John J. Barrett. Judge Conlan has post

Other Tableaux at the Carnival of
Ancient and Modern Art Elicit
Warm Praise. â¢
The first rendering of "The Marsellalse"
by Roget de L'Isle formed the subject of
a tableau at the carnival, of ancient
and modern art in Native Sons' Hall last
evening. It was French night at the car
nival, and the French Consul and the
presidents of nearly all the French socie
ties in San Francisco were present In
honor of the occasion. The tableau of
"The Marsellaise" called forth lively ap
plause from the representatives of all na
tions. Altogether the mood of the French
Americans- was patriotic, and they did
not stint their manifestations of approval.
There were other tableaux. One was
from a painting by Jacques. Louis David,
"The Crowning of Josephine." There was
also one based upon a poem by Racine,
"Athalle." The band of the Jewish Or
phan Asylum supplied the music.
Headed by the Goddess of Liberty and
Uncle Sam and Columbia, the costumed
chiefs of the booths and their forces of
assistants â¢ joined in the grand march.'
There has not been a more successful
evening since the opening of the carni
val. Including this evening . there are
three more nights of the carnival. " The
Germans have the honors to-night. The
tableaux will represent scenes from "Loh
engrin," "Faust" and "William Tell."
Miss A. Barkduli, Mrs. S. Braverman and
Dr. Anna Joost, the presidents of the
German booths, .will preside over â¢ the
tableaux. "Germania" will be represented
by Dr. Anna Joost in the grand march.
To-morrow evening will be Irish night,
and Saturday evening will be devoted to
Italian tableaux. The carnival is fully
realizing the expectations of the "man
agers of the Women's Educational and
Industrial Association, for the benefit of
which it is given. â¢ Â¦

The visiting Episcopalians in this city
saw about the greater part of the rain of
yesterday. There were slight dashes as
far ncrth as Red Bluff, in the interior, but
there was none at Eureka and northward
on the coast. Nor was there any at
Fresno. Light showers fell in this citv,
at Santa Cruz and at Tres Plnos and near
by points. Mr. McAdie says that the
meteorological. conditions existing yester
day were exceptional for this time of the
year. Ordinarily, with a low east
of the Rocky Mountains and the barom
eter making the records that the Weather
Bureau had to- credit to it officially, there
would have been a southeast storm ex
tending to Los Angeles and San Diego
but there was no precipitation at either
of those points. Yesterday afternoon the
flags of the city floated toward the east
signifying the coming of the west wind
and presaging clear weather for to-day
The barometer rose and was high. Mr.
McAdie looks for good weather to-day.

On May 27, the witness said, he went to
Wilson's office to see about a bond being
put up by Wilson in the appeal case, and
they quarreled. He alleged that Wilson
threatened to throw him out of his of
fice, arid when he was leaving he stum
bled and fell and Wilson seized a chair
with which to strike him. Being afraid
of his life he shot Wilson. His cross-ex
amination will go on to-day.
A number of witnesses were called to
testify to the defendant's reputation in
the community and as to Wilson's repu
tation. Among the latter was Attorney
E. S. Pillsbury and Joseph Hayes of the
Recorder's office, who testified that Wil
eon's reputation was bad.

own behalf. He told of his employing
Wilson to look after his interests in the

Gage, Secretary of- the Treasury, arrived
In this city this morning and left for
Camp Talcott, the home of Colonel Bray
nerd, on Left Hand Creek, near Ward,
where Secretary Gage owns the mines.
"Do you anticipate any changes in the
Cabinet, Mr. Gage?" was asked.
"Well, Secretary riay is getting tired of
the business," said Mr. Gage. "He is a
man of the strictest honor. He is very
sensitive, however, and it hurts him after
he has worked hard to be misrepresented,
cartooned and lampooned. He is inde
pendently rich. He can do as he wishes,
go wherever he desires. He has a very
few intimate friends and would rather en
joy life surrounded by these friends and
his books than to attend to the very tire
some and endless routine of the office of
Secretary of State. I should not be sur
prised if he should soon withdraw. If so,
Mr. Root will take his place in all proba
bility."

Richelieu, owned by the Rlchelleu-On
tario Navigation Company and engaged
on the route between Kingston and Belle
ville, foundered to-day while bound for
this city. -She was within three miles of
port when she took a header and sank.

before it could be righted it filled and
went down in about sixty feet of water.
Her crew and passengers got - ashore
safely.

J. "W. Thompson, a discharged janitor,
petitioned that he be granted a hearing.
The West of Castro Street Improvement
Club petitioned that two .lots on Eliza
beth and Douglass streets adjoining the
site for a new schoolhouse at Twenty
fourth and Douglass be purchased by the
board. It is claimed that the added space
would Improve the sanitary conditions and
give more room for a playground.
Mrs. V. E. Smith was transferred from
the Ccoper to the Denman School, and
Miss E. T. Holmes from the Noe Valley
School to the Peabody.
Leaves of absence were granted to Miss
Julia A. Murphy and Miss Esther Living
ston.

The following assignments were made:
Teachers who are sick need expect no
mercy from the Board of Education when
they apply for leaves of absence. -This
was demonstrated yesterday when Miss
Annie Sutherland, a teacher in the Spring
Valley, asked for a leave from October 2,
1901, to January 1, 1902. She filed a doc
tor's certificate to the effect that she was
in ill health and that It was necessary for
her to have rest from her work. Under
the rules a teacher who is granted a leave
for six months or less is entitled to return
to her class. Directors Kincaid and Den
man expressed themselves as opposed to
granting the leave unless Miss Sutherland
would waive her right to return to her
class. The rules were suspended and the
leave granted, but Miss Sutherland must
take her changes at getting an assign
ment when she reports for duty.
The pupils under F. H. Dam, a teacher
in the Girls' High School, whose applica
tion for an absence leave has been denied
by the board, filed a petition that he be
retained in his position. Dam's original
leave has expired, and unless the board
experiences a change of heart he is now
out of the department. Dam's physician
filed a certificate that his patient is suf
fering from overwork. The board took
no action. ...

Dr. L. D. â¢ Bacigalupl, autopsy surgeon
to the Coroner, testified that the bullet
entered Bailey's left breast above the left
nipple and four Inches to the left of the
breastbone. Then It ranged downward,
Inward and backward toward the spine.
The wound was powder burned, as though
the weapon had been fired at close range.
On the assumption that the ball was de
flected by the rib It was possible, said the
witness, for Bailey to have fired the shot
himself.
Dr. Allen, resident physician of St.
Luke's Hospital, who was called in im
mediately aftÂ«r the shooting, testified
that Mrs. Bailey gave him to understand
that she had shot her husband, but he
could not- remember her exact words. She
said to her sister, Mrs. Gardner: "Give
me the pistol. Wouldn't you rather see
me dead than in prison?"
Mrs. Carrie Gardner of 118% Clipper
street testified that she found husband
and wife quarreling. Bailey was jealous
of some man whom he did not name. Mrs.
Bailey informed her that Bailey had made
threats to kill, and the witness left the
house. She had gone about a half-block
when Mrs. Bailey called her back and told
her that Bailey had been shot. Later she
told the witness that Bailey had tried to
kill her and had then shot himself.
Mrs. Bailey was the first witness at the
inquest. She gave her age as 29 years and
that of her husband as 53. On the day of
the shooting, September 25, her husband
had been drinking, she said, and was very
abusive, insulting her and throwing a
glass of whisky into her face. She sent
for her sister, Mrs. Gardner, whereupon
Bailey became so boisterous and quarrel
some that Mrs. Gardner left. After she
had gone Bailey took a pistol from a bu
reau drawer and threatened to kill his
wife and himseit. He caught hold of her
and she broke away. Then he fired two
shots and sank bleeding into a chair. She
called In her tdster. and asked the dying
man to forgive her after he had asked for
forgiveness from her.
Mrs. Newton J. Bailey, held on suspi
cion of murdering her husband, was re
leased from custody yesterday by order of
Police Captain Seymour after he had
learned of the verdict of suicide rendered
by the Coroner's jury.
Mrs. McCarthy was a Miss Webber be
fore she became the wife of the young
real estate man. She was considered one
of the beauties of the swell set and the
marriage was a great society event.
The troubles of the McCarthys com
menced about a year ago. In the com
plaint filed by the husband yesterday he
alleges that his wife left him September
1. 1900, and since that time they have lived
apart. He further alleges in the com
plaint that when they separated his wife
was given the custody of the younger
child, Lillian, while he retained the cus
tody of the Â«lder, Aileen. aad that he is
satisfied to have the arrangement con
tinued.
McCarthy further sets forth that he has
made ample provision for the mainten
ance of his wife and the child under her
care. He has settled upon her her share
of the community property, and is In ad
dition willing to make a suitable allow
ance for the support of both her and the
child.
Though Mr. and Mrs. E. Avery McCar
thy, the well-known society people, have
persistently denied the rumens that their
married life was unhappy and said that
there was no truth in the tales which a
short time ago were being told by the
members of the smart set, the fact re
mains that they have not been living a
life of peace.
The first move towarj ending their un
happiness was made by the husband yes
terday, when he filed a complaint for di
vorce against his wife, alleging desertion
as the cause of action-
The McCarthys were married in 1S92 and
have had two children born to them,
Aileen, who is now about 8 years of age.
and Lillian, who is about five years
younger.

would materially better himself by ac
cepting the position offered him by the
