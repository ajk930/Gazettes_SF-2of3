SIBYL SANDERSON BACK TO HER OLD HOME
FLUSHED WITH UNDYING GLORY OF EUROPE'S
APPROVAL AND ANXIOUS TO WIN OUR FAVOR
Recalls Old Times, Old Friends and Old Scenes, Tells ' A
necdotes of Days Gone By and Patches Up a Quarrel
With an Old Friend, Who Makes the First Advances
AFTER an absence of sixteen
years, during which time ehe has
gained world-wide fame and a
tremendous fortune, Sibyl Sander
son came quietly into town yes
terday morning and went directly to the
Palace, where she will make her home
during her etay in this city.
The first person the prima donna met
mt she stepped into the Palace elevator
was a friend of olden days.
"How do you do, dear," said the visitor
Impulsively and laying so much stress on
tr.e "dear" that the great singer after
ward told about it. And then they shook
hiuids and for a few minutes swapped
reminiscences, and thus healed the breach
â¢xlsting between them and dating back
y to a Paris dinner of several years ago.
7 Madame Sandersonâ as she desires to be
known in public liftfâ was not at her
best yesterday. However, if Mrs. Yost,
the singer's aunt, had not explained this
to her interviewers, no one would have
suspected it. The trip from Los Angeles
to this city had been a very trying one
for the singer. She had eaten some
canned meats that had made her ill and
dectors had to be telegraphed for and
doses of laudanum administered before
the pain could be allayed. Although the
lady thought she "was going to die" and
spent a miserable night in a very cold
cf r, Madame Sanderson's friends need
have no apprehension- She is thoroughly
and absolutely well and without the pos
elbilitr of Â«yen a very slight cold.
The rooms reserved for Madame San
derson were a perfect bower of flowers
when she came to them. Legions of
friends had sent their choicest blossoms
to welcome home the celebrated song
stress. There were roses and violets.
leng-stemmed shaggy chrysanthemums
e.:id an immense bunch of gTeat pink Han
n.-Lh Hobart carnations. The flowers
charmed Madame Sanderson. She snuffed
cm delightedly. The great carna
Â¦ especially pleased her.
"Look at those pinks," she kept eaylng
over and over again. "Did you ever see
anything like them? I never have."
Madame Sanderson quite upsets one's
preconceived ideas of a prima donna. She
is- not fat. She does not muffle up her
throat. She is charmingly natural, and
Â¦ exactly like her photographs. Of
course she said she was pleased to be
once again in San Francisco, but she did
not dwell upon the fact. Naturally she
declared that she was a bit nervous about
% a San Francisco audience, and
neither did she emphasize this statement.
Her old friend Henry Redington was
h her while she met her interviewers.
With the aid of his very good memory
the songstress recalled old times and old
Â¦nds. Redington called her Sibyl, and
fd implicitly upon his version of
ays rone by. She smiled fascinat
at him when she told it, and he
d back and said "that was many
Â¦ afro and Sibyl was so youngâ a mere
girl then."
"Do you remember when we all went
d Mm in a special train to the opening of
the Hotel del Monte?" asked the prima
donna of Redington. "And do you remem
:ow vie used to go every Saturday
:o the Bush-Ftrert Theater?"
q jeried Eedington. And then Damrosch
; rima donna had
HÂ«ltuÂ»i ' him she turned a
ftdfoc face to him and said:
"I tell you where I want to go to while
I am here. I want to go to the minstrels."
Damrosch said. "Very well, " ignorant
that he was promising that which he
could not possibly fulfill. Then one of tho
interviewers told Madame Sanderson that
there was no stock minstrel show here
like there was in her time, and she
c ghed and said she was "Oh, so sorry."
Sibyl Sanderson is very pretty. She is
tall and graceful and is at once roguish
and dignified. She i? about as French as
it is possible for a California girl to be,
e v en to a very slight French turn to her
speech and a suspicion of a French ac
cent. She says she loves- Paris, and the
-ringuishing touch of the gay capital is
mped all over her from the tips of the
c blue little pointed satin slippers that

"J love Paris and St. Petersburg," she
said, "and I suppose it is because they

Madame Sanderson was extremely anx

that have appeared from time to time in
the various papers about her.
"There is no truth in any of them," she
said. "The only true one was that I was

CONGRESS MAY REVOKE
DR. MARY WALKER'S PENSION
1 Officials Investigate Alleged Utter

WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â The Pension

It is but necessary to see Madame San
derson to be i-onvinced that her restora
tion to health is perfect and complete.
Her face is round and firm and smooth,
and her gray eyes that are set well apart
are clear and bright, all of which be
token health and vigor. The dress sh<Â±

"half conceals and half reveals," lets it

The meeting was to discuss matters of
reciprocity, revenue and tariff which may
come before their committee at the ap

State Department Takes Prompt Step?
to Thwart the Bold Design
of the Berlin Gov
ernment.
Special Disoatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â Finding It
impolitic to acquire a coaling station on
the shores of the Caribbean Sea by direct
negotiation, Germany has apparently at
tempted to evade the Monroe doctrine by
obtaining control of territory for this pur
pose through one of her subsidized steam
ship lines. An official report has been re
ceived by the State Department from Jo
seph Bowron, United States Consul at
Carthagena, announcing that the Ham
burg-American Steamship Company, own
ers of the Atlas line, which plies between
Central and South American ports, had
filed an application with the Colombian
Government for the right to establish a
coaling station near that city.
Referred to Bradford.
Immediately upon receipt of this report
Secretary Hay referred it to the Navy De
partment, and the effect of the applica
tion is now being considered by Rear Ad
miral Bradford, Chief of the Bureau of
Equipment and coaling station expert of
the service.
While there is no disposition on the part
of the United States to interfere with pri
vate enterpriser *here s no doubt that the
administration it oukt "-prefer that \hb ap
plication of the Hamburg-American lino be
not granted. That company draws a sub
sidy from the German Government and
in case of war its steamers would be avail
able for use by the German Government
as auxiliary cruisers. A coal pile near
Carthagena would be of immense value,
as a fleet using it as a base would, if suf
ficiently strong, be able to dominate the
Caribbean Sea and the eastern terminus
of the Isthmian Canal.
Of Strategic Importance.
The strategic importance of a coaling
station at or near Carthagena Is hard to
overestimate. The application of the
Hamburg-American line is regarded not
only in official but in diplomatic circles
as the thin edge of wedge intended to
split the Monroe doctrine.
Senor Herran, Colombian Charge d'Af
faires, is confident that the application
will be very carefully considered by the
Colombian officials.
"The application is probably made to
the President of Colombia," said Senor
Herran, "but it will be referred to the
Governor of the State of Carthagena for
his views. This official is one of the great
est jingoes in the country and is strongly
opposed to the extension of European in
fluence in Colombia. The only coaling
station that Colombia is disposed to con
cede is one to the United States in con
nection with the Panama Canal."
IDENTIFIES SUSPECT
AS A NOTED DESPERADO
rormer Wyoming Official Declares St.
Louis Prisoner to Be an
ex-Convict.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. B.â John Rose, th-3
man suspected of the robbery of an ex
press car on the Great Northern Railway
near Wagner, Mont., July 3 last and who
was arrested Ll this city by detectives on
Tuesday, was to-day identified as Harry
Longbaugh, a celebrated Western des
perado. The Identification was made by
a St. Louisan, who desires his name with
held from publication. He was prosecut
ing attorney for Cook County, Wyoming,
in 1887 and prosecuted Longbaugh in that
year on a charge of horse stealing. Long
baugh was convicted and sentenced to
eighteen months in jail. The ex-prose
cuting attorney described to Chief Des
mond the distinguishing marks of the
Longbaugh of 1887, and as these are all
found on the prisoner he Is satisfied that
he has the bandit properly identified.
Chief of Detectives Desmond said to
night that he would if necessary send for
one of the officers of Wagner, Mont., at
the department's expense to come here
and identify Longbaugh.
"We can prosecute him here if neces
sary," said the chief, "either in the Fed
eral court on a charge of forgery, or in
the State courts on the charge of uttering
a fraudulent instrument. In this way wo
are sure to be able to hold him here until
we can thoroughly investigate his rec
ord."

DEATH OF EARL LI HUNG CHANG IS HASTENED
BY A VERY VIOLENT DISPUTE WITH RUSSIAN
MINISTER LESSAR OVER MANCHURIAN TREATY
After a Stormy Interview With the Czar's Representative
the Aged Diplomat Goes Home Feeling Furious and Is
Stricken With Hemorrhage â His Successor Is Chosen
P EKING, Nov. B.â A violent dispute
with Paul Lessar, Russian Minis
ter to China, over the Manchu
rlan treaty appears to have been
the immediate cause of the death
of LI Hung Chang. The diplomatic events
preceding this tragic climax have enabled
Japan for a moment to frustrate the de
signs of Rus3la. A fortnight ago the
Japanese legation secured a reliable out
line of the terms of the treaty and there
upon demanded that the Chinese plenipo
tentiaries officially lay before them the
text, basing this demand upon the alle
gation that Japanese interests were in
volved in any change of the status of
Manchuria.
The Chinese plenipotentiaries refused to
comply with the demand. Thereupon the
Japanese Government from Tokio com
municated with the Southern Viceroys
and induced them to use their influence
with the Empress Dowager against the
treaty. In the meantime the Empress
Dowager Instructed Li Hung Chang l<i
communicate the treaty, after certain
modifications, to the Ministers of the
powers, and if they did not object to sign
the same.
Fatal Hemorrhage Follows.
Ll Hung Chang visited M. Lessar and
explained to him the instructions. The
Russian Minister strongly objected to re
vealing the text of the treaty to the Min
isters of the other powers, and a stormy
Interview ensued. Ll Hung Chang went
home in a violent passion and had a
hemorrhage, which the doctors attribute
to the over-exertion of a weakened sys
tem.
While these things were happening in
Peking the southern Viceroys sent to the
Empress Dowager a memorial against the
treaty. On receiving it she telegraphed
to Li Hung Chang countermanding the
order to sign. This instruction came after
Li Hung Chang had become unconscious.
When M. Lessar endeavored to have LI
Hung Chang's seal affixed to the treaty
Chou Fu, Provincial Treasurer, had ar
rived from Paotingfu and had taken
charge of the seals as the temporary suc
cessor of Earl Li.
The flag of the United States legation
was the only one half-masted in Peking
to-day. The mourners and the family of
Li Hung Chang will burn paper offerings
to-morrow, in accordance with custom,
for the use of his spirit in the other
world. The street is hung with mourning
emblems. All the attendants at the ya
.men are richly attired and many of them
gaudily dressed. To-day musicians beat
drums about the house.
Earl Li's Successor.
The special edict has arrived her* ap
pointing Yuan Shi Kai (Governor of Shan
tung Province) to be Governor of the pro
vince of Chili, and appointing Wang Wen
Shao president of the Foreign Office and
a member of the Cabinet to succeed Li
Hung Chang as plenipotentiary- They are
both ordered to come to Peking forthwith.
Another edict creates Li Hung Chang a
Marquis and bestows on him the new
name of Li Wen Chung, by which he will
be known in history.
LI Hung Chang's estate will remain in
tact for the use of his eldest son, who will
provide for the other members of his fam
ily.
Yuan Shi Kai'a successor in the Gov
ernorship of the Province of Shantung is
Chang Yen Chun, who has been holding
an unimportant though lucrative position
as grain commissioner in one of the In
lands towns of the province. He will be
watched with the deepest solicitude, as
the peace of China will largely depend
upon his course.
Wang Weng Shao, who is 74 years of
age and deaf, was never rated as a states
man or a diplomatist. His appointment
is probably temporary.
Emperor's Military Spirit.
Telegraphic communication with Prince
Ching was obtained to-day. He la has
tening to meet the court. After consulta
tion he will return with Wang Weng
Shao, who Is accompanying the court,
which is now five days' journey from Kai
Fong Fu.
Emperor Kwang Su, report says, is as
serting himself and leading the imperial
cortege on horseback. Native papers de
clare that he purposes to inaugurate a
revival of the military spirit, assuming the
honorary position of commander-in-chief
and "wearing a uniform. They also assert
that he will compel the nobles to follow
his example, to take military positions and
to study military science.
A Drlvate letter from a European now
in Tai Yuen Fu says that two British of"
fleers, with -a party of Indian soldiers, en
countered the imperial procession, were
suspected of unfriendly motives and were
detained as prisoners by the Emperor's
body guard for a few days. Apparently
this was an exploring party commanded
by Major Manifold and Captain Hunter,
who has been operating in that region for
some time.
Kai a Smart Man.
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â Minister Con
ger at Peking has informed the State De
partment that Yuan Shi Kai has been ap
pointed to succeed Li Hung Chang as
Viceroy of Chili, and that Wang Weng
Shao has been appointed Deputy Viceroy
of the same province. Yuan is the pres
ent Viceroy of Shantung Province.

pointment that could have been matte
from all China, according to Rockhill, the
Special Commissioner of the United
States to China. He is about 45 years old
and came originally from the province of
Hunan, where he began his public career
as a military officer. He was made Min
ister to Korea, and for many years ably
defended Chinese interests in that trou
bled land. As Governor of Shantung he
showed surprising ability in tranquiliain*
that dangerous province, while his gift for
diplomacy was exercised fully in prevent
ing friction between the turbulent popula
tion of the peninsula and the Germans
when the latter were steadily encroaching
from their original holdings at Kiaochau
on the north coast.
As a military man Yuan showed his
ability by the organization of what Is un
doubtedly thÂ«Â» best military force in
China, and they were his troops that oc
cupied Peking last summer when the for
<Agn forces were withdrawn. They are
thoroughly disciplined and well officered,
and, considering Chinese conservatism,
they form a magnificent display of Yuan's
ability.
Shao Is a Reformer.
Watig Wengr Shao, who is made Deputy
Viceroy of Chili, is also a man of marked
ability. Fortunately he always has been
friendly to foreign ideas and is not a re
actionist. He was one of the Grand Sec
retaries of State and is at present one O***
the two Ministers appointed to form the\
new Chinese Foreign Office which will re
' place the Tsung-Li-Yamen. Wang is a
man of affairs and was himself a member
of the T3ung-Li-Yamen some years ago,
besides having been Director of Mines
and Railways. He has been with the im- /
perial court ever since it fled from Pe
king.
The records show that he always h? Jk

ARMED CITIZENS KILL CONVICTS
IN A RUNNING DUEL IN KANSAS
Hundreds of Pursuers Now Out on the
Trail of the Desperae Men Who Escaped
From the Leavenworth "Prison Stockade
LEAVENWORTH, Kara., Nov. S.â
All the police, Deputy Sheriffs
and farmers in the country adja
cent to Leavenworth were on the
lookout to-day for the twenty-six
federal convicts who escaped from the
stockade here yesterday. As a result two
convicts have been killed, two wounded
and five captured unhurt. The casualties
took place in a fight near Nortonville,
Kan., that resulted in the death or cap
ture of five men. The dead are:
JAMES HOFFMAN, aged 20 years,
white.
J. J. POFFENHOLZ, aged 25 years,
white, a soldier convict.
The wounded are: Johh Green, aged 21,
white, and Willard Drake, aged 19, white.
Fred Moore, aged 16, a negro,- was recap
tured unhurt.
The five men were discovered in the
barn of Fay Welshaar, a quarter of a
mile from Nortonville, Kans., about 3
o'clock this afternoon. Weishaar went
into the barn and was ordered out at the
point of guns. He rushed to Nortonville
and gathered a wagonload of men who
with revolvers, shotguns and a few riMes
hastened to the scene.
The convicts saw the men coming and
rushed from the barn. They had a rifle,
a shotgun and an old revolver. Hoffman
carried the shotgun. In the running duel
he was struck first in the hand. He yelled
and dropped the gun. Just then a bullet
entered his back and he fell dead. Poffcn
WILL ARREST
THE DEFAULTER
Maccabee Officials to Act
Against Charles
Thompson.
PORT HURON. Mich., Nov. B.â lt now
transpires that the Fidelity and Deposit
Company of Maryland, which carried the
bond of Charles D. Thompson, the self
confessed defaulting supreme finance
keeper of the tent of the Knights of the
Maccabees before being released last
July, is still liable for any loss which the
order may have sustained by the defalca
tion.
Representatives of the company, it is
said, have informed Maccabee officials
that the loss will be paid. Therefore it is
now probable that Thompson will be ar
rested to-morrow. This was indicated to
night from a talk of officials of the order,
and the arrest will come as a result of a
conference between the trustees of the
order and representatives of the bonding
company.
The heaviest loss, it is said, falls upon
the Maryland Fidelity Company, as
Thompson's defalcations since August,
when the National Surety Company as
sumed the risk, were comparatively small.
It was announced to-day that Thompson's
shortage was $60,000 instead of $57,000. All
data concerning the embezzlement are in
the hands of the bond company and or
ders are being aw Mted from headquar
ters.
The aaost important matter for consid
eration before the trustees was the selec
tion of a successor for Thompson, but no
successor was announced.

Two unarmed convicts were found hid

Kan., and they surrendered without re
sistance. The Sheriff of Douglass County
captured two convicts at Lawrence, TKan.
They are Ole Bobo, a half-breed Indian,
and Joseph H. Deekin, a soldier serving
a term for desertion and assault to kill.
Frank Thompson, the negro desperado
who led the outbreak, is supposed to be
.near Lawrence, heavily armed. He will
probably not be taken alive.
Nearly all the convicts came from Okla
homa, and Indian Territory and they are
supposed to be making for that country.
They are a hard lot of men, used to fire
arms and horses. Some have obtained
both, but others are afoot and detense
less. Warden McCloughrey says .he will
capture every one of the men. In The dis

the $60 reward that will be paid for the
return of each convict. Those of the con

the two previous years. The extent and
nature of work under way or projected in
shipyards* promises an even greater
growth for the current fiscal year.
American tonnage has now attained
practically the former maximum of 1861.
The figures of 1901, compared with 1861,
show an increase in coasting trade ves
sels from 2,704,554 tons to 4,582,683 tons
(two-thirds of this increase being on the
great lakes); a decrease in foreign trade
vessels from 2,496,tÂ»48 tons to 879,595 tons,
and a decrease in whaling and fishing ves
sels from 338,375 tons to 61,940 tons.
Of our total tonnage 3,623.210 tons are
wooden vessels and only 1,901,017 tons are
iron or steel. In 1900 Great Britain
launched 1,440,000 tons of steel vessels.
Porto Rico appears in the returns with
twenty-five vessels of 5297 fons and Ha
waii with sixty-four vessels of 37,149 tons.
In the Philippines 2340 vessels of iU2,SSI
tons (of which 149 vessels are steam) are
under American protection. Until Con
gress has so enacted, the report says,
Philippine vessels are not vessels of the
United States.
Small American Cargoes.
Although registered American vessels
increased 62,635 tons during the year,
American vessels carried only 8.2 per cent
of our exports and imports, the smallest
percentage in our history. Our fleet of
ocean steamers in fofeign trade, the re
port says, is too small to be compared
with that of foreign nations. The fleets
of each of the four 'large British and
German steamship corporations exceeds
the American fleets in tonnage, mileage
and business. The tonnage built and
documented !n the United States during
the past fiscal year comprised 1580 vessels
of 453.469 gross tons.
The steel vessels under construction or
under contract during the current fiscal
year will much exceed similar tonnage
built in any previous year. The bureau
is advised of eighty-nine such merchant
vessels of 355.465 gross tons, to be valued
at about $36,000,000. Besides these seven
ty-one naval vessels of 281,148 tons' dis
placement are building. In this worl:
forty-four olants, with a capital of about
$68,000,000, employing about 46,000 men, am
engaged.
The American cost of building a steam
er of the Minnehaha type is $1,846,800, and
the British cost is $1,419,200. The Ameri
can cost of the smaller trans-Atlantic
caigo steamers will be $729,000, and the
British price ranges from $534,000 to $486,
00.
Wages on the Vessels.
The difference of wages on American
and foreign vessels is considered in
detail. The pay noil (excluding mas
ter), the report says, of 1580 men on the
steamship St. Louis is $11,300; of 427 men
on the British steamship Oceanic is $9900,
and of 900 men on the German steamship
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse $7715.
The report coi.tains a detailed statement
of the foreign voyages of American ves
sels last year, showing that the American
flag was seen much oftener in the North
Atlantic during President Jefferson's em
bargo (1805) or during the cruises of the
Alabama than at present. Foreign ship Â¦
ping in our Pacific trade had doubled in
three years. The purchase of the Ley
land line is spoken of in the report as
evidence that American capital is willing
to invest in ocean steamships; that theic
is an advantage to .American exporter-?
in American control of ocean steamships,
even if not under the American flag, and
that in the coming development of our
ocean transportation facifities the union
of trunk railroad lines and steamship cor
porations will be an important factor.
Including the Leyland purchase, Ameri
can caDital owns fully 670:000 tons of
steamers under foreign flags, which in
actual carrying power exceed all Ameri
can vessels now engaged in foreign trade.
The War and Navy Departments also own
126,847 gross tons of foreign built trans
ports and colliers.
"The principal foreign and American
ocean mail contracts are printed in full,
and it is shown that at the present prices
of steamships British ocean mail contracts
are more advantageous for steamer Â¦lines
than American contracts under the act of
1891.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1901.
IF SCHLEY IS DULY VINDICATED
HE MAY BECOME A VICE ADMIRAL
Friends Are Most Anxious That Congress Reward the
Distinguished Naval Veteran.
BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W., WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â lf the court of inquiry which has just fln
(T ished the takingof testimony relative to the conduct of Rear Admiral Schley during the Santiago campaign ab-
I . solves that officer from blame, or at most finds him guilty of only errors of judgment, a resolution will be
introduced in Congress reviving the grade of vice admiral for his benefit. Should the court report, on the
other hand, that Rear Admiral Sohley was censurable undtr several precepts, a Congressional investigation
is likely to be begun immediately after the session opens. It can be stated authoritatively that Secretary Long would
welcome such an investigation. In his communication to the the Secretary made no charge of cowardice
against Rear Admiral Schley. The Secretary rather believes him to be personally courageous. At the same time Long
stated that the commander-in-chief of the flying squadron lacked steadiness and push.
It has been alleged that Rear Admiral Crowninshleld, chief of the Bureau of Navigation, was head and front of
the naval conspiracy which sought to discredit Rear Admiral Schley. Rear Admiral Qrowninshield declares this charge
ridiculous and is prepared, his friends ass-crt, to show conclusively that he has not engaged in any â¢ movement against
the admiral. It is asserted that the evidence presented before the court of inquiry has proven that there was no alter
ation of the records of the Spanish warâ another charge made against Rear Admiral Crowninshield.
â¢ As showing the fairness of the President and Secretary Long, it is understood that if the court's finding should
be favorable to Rear Admiral Schley, -.there will be no opposition to the movement by the latter's friends to secure
for him proper reward.
The court to-day began transferring effects jfrom the gunners' workshop in the navy yard to quarters in the Mc-
Lean building; which will be consulting quarters. No conference will be held before next Monday, as the members are
in need of a physical rest. The published testimony comprise^ more than 810,008 words. It is the purpose of the court
to make a brief of the testimony relating to each specification of the precept, and from this findings will be prepared.
SULTAN BOWS
BEFORE FRANCE
Timorous Turkey Yields
to All the Demands
Made.
â¢ â Â¦ â -
PARIS, Nov. B.â France has scored a
complete triumph in the Turkish dispute.
An official note was issued at 1 p. m. to
day to the effect that the Porte has de
cided to yield to all the demands of
France and that as soon as the Sultah
has issued an iradÂ« ratifying the decision
the French squadron will leave Mitylene..
This may be done within twenty-four
hours, or it is expected at the latest in
two or three days.
President Loubet presided to-day at the
Cabinet council. The Foreign Minister,
M. Delcasse, announced that the Porte
had just informed him that it had de
cided to give satisfaction in the case of
the various French demands, in which M. .
Delcasse replied that so soon as the Sul
tan's order regarding the Porte's decision
was communicated to him Admiral Cail
lard's squadron would leave the island of
Mitylere.
The Temps prints a dispatch from Con
stantinople stating the Sultan has accept
ed the demands and authorizes and rec
ognizes the existence of religious and
charitable institutions, and he authorizes
the reconstruction of the schools and
hospitals destroyed in the time of the
Armenian troubles, of which a detailed
list is attached to the French note.
Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish Foreign Min
ister, has announced that the recognition
of the Chaldean Patriarch demanded by
France already has been accorded.
VIENNA, Nov. B.â The Neu Frie Presse
publishes the contents of a circular note
addressed by the Ottoman Minister,
Tewflk Pasha, to the representatives of
Turkey abroad, announcing that the
Porte nas satisfied all the French de
mands and expressing a hope that France
will appreciate the conciliatory spirit thua
displayed and resume the relations so un
fortunately interrupted.
STJLTAN IS WELL SCARED.
Success of France May Stir Other
Powers to Action.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â Turkey f s
hands will be frequently in her pockets
as a result of the naval demonstration
which France is making. This at least is
the opinion of the officials and diplomats
who have been considering the effect of
the French seizure of the island of Mity
lene. France is not the only European
power that has claims against Turkey,
and in view of the success of the French
method it would not be surprising should
other nations observe it in the collection
of their claims.
Should the responsibility for the abduc
tion of Miss Stone be finally placed with
Turkey, the United States will present a
claim for indemnity, and the French au
thorities here believe that the effect of
their naval demonstration will be to cause
the Porte to make arrangements for an
immediate settlement. So far as the State
Department is advised, none of the gov
ernments to which France communicated
her purposes in connection with the seiz
ure of Mitylene island have responded
unfavorably. Secretary Hay's reply to
the French representation was this:
"The United States is not concerned
with the action of* France, but should
American interests be endangered, if will,
of course, be necessary to provide them
with protection."

SEEK LETTERS
FROM BRIGANDS
Authorities of Bulgaria
Endanger Safety of
Miss Stone.
SOFIA, Nov. S.â The Government last
night caused the arrest of a man who
was visiting United States Consul General
Dickinson and searched him, presumably
thinking he was an emissary of the brig
ands and hoping to seize a communica
tion to or from Miss Ellen M. Stone. The
man was subsequently released.
This act of the authorities was seem
ingly a deliberate attempt to frighten del
egates who might visit Dickinson and
thus prevent negotiations from taking
place in Bulgarian territory. The attitude
of the authorities has hampered Dickin
son, as the brigands refuse to treat in
Turkey.
Dickinson, in his reply to Miss Stone's
letter, urged the brigands to still further
reductions in their demands and to accept
the amount subscribed, in view of the de
termination of the Government not to
contribute toward the ransom and the
impossibility of collecting further sub
scriptions. It is believed the brigands
will agree to this, as they are now begin
ning to feel hard pressed and want money
for current expenses, such as bribery of
officials, peasants and others.
The letter insists that the surrender of
the prisoners must precede or be" simul
taneous with the payment, but leaves the
question of the place open. A messenger
last night brought a letter from Miss
Stone, written in English. All the previ
ous communications from Miss Stone
have been in Bulgarian. This letter says
she is still well and gives valuable in
formation about her captors which Miss
Stone was prevented from sending in
Bulgarian.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 8.-All that can
be gathered here touching Miss Stone's
case is that the reports from the Levant
are to the effect that some kind of com
munication is being maintained, although
very indirectly, between Miss Stone's cap
tors and the power* to secure her release.
It is up,to this point believed the mission
aries themselves have been able to keep
up the line of communication.
INSTJLT TO UNCLE SAM.
Venezuela's President Forgets Cour
tesy in Accepting Offer From Chile.
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â ln accepting
Chile's offer of mediation it is apparent
to the Washington administration that
President Castro of Venezuela desired t>
deliberately insult the United Stales. Of
ficial information of the acceptance of th >
Chilean mediation has been received here,
but in view of the terms fixed by Castro
there is no disposition here to credit
Chile with a -Jesire to pursue the matter
further. The United States offered to us.;
its good offices last August. The offer
was gratefully received uy Colombia,
which has insisted that it wants no for
eign war, but President Castro was un
willing to have the United States inter
vene.
Castro Is as much in need of external
peace, it is learned from an official
source, as is Colombia. His invasions oL
Colombia have been disastrous, and he U
just making headway against revolution
in his own territory. For him to now in
sist that Colombia shall make reparation
and pay damages for an invasion by Co
lombia of his territory is said by the
authorities here to be ridiculous.
Senor Herran, Charge d' Affaires of the
Colombian legation, said to-night that the
Chilean offer of mediation was made Ion;?
after the United States made known its
willingness to intervene and was cordial
ly accepted by Ms Government. The pre
tensions of President Castro are ridicu
lous, Herran said, and Colombia will cer
tainly not make reparation, because sh-j
is guilty of no offense.
The rebels in Colombia are encouraged
by the capture of the port of Tumaco.
The revolutionists took 400 or 500 soldiers
as prisoners, captured five or six cannon,
.a number of l'iffes and a quantity of am
munition, with one small ship, the Caitan.
Senor Herran says the loss of Tumaco Ie
unimportant to his Government, as it is
far away from Bogota.
PANAMA, Nov. B.â The revolutionary
gunboat Darien, which was captured
from the Colombian Government, recent
ly stopped the Telegrafo, a Government
vessel, proceeding- from David with troops
under Captain Delbusto. The Darien cap
tured the soldiers and arms and ammuni
tion. While she was towing away th 2
Telegrafo a barge bringing the remainder
of the federal troops to Fort Aguadalic3
came into sight. The Darien then let go
the Telegrafo and steamed at full spec 1
for Chorreva.
BOSTON WELCOMES
THE IRISH ENVOYS
Nationalist Members of Parliament
Given a Bousing Reception on
Their Arrival.
BOSTON, Nov. 3.â A great reception was
given the Irish envoys, John E. Redmond,
"M. P.,. P. A. McHugh, M. P., and Thomas
O'Donnell, M. P., as' they landed at the
terminal station from New York to-day.
The station platform was a mass of men.
held in check by a cordon of officers.
Within a roped inclosure were the mem
bers of the reception committee of the
United Irish League. As the trio came to
a stop and Redmond was seen on the car
steps cheers rang out loud and long.
Then there was a rush which swept away
the officers and nearly carried the vis
itors off their feet.
In a few minutes the crowd became
calmer, and, escorted by the reception
committee, the envoys were taken to
Hotel Bellevue, where they spent a quiet
evening informally rceiving visitors.

ANTARCTIC ICE
BURS HER WAY
Sugar-Laden Bark Finds
a Barrier Below
Cape Horn.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. B.â The first
vessel to be caught in Antarctic ice this
season and within 100 miles of the Horn
was the sugar bark Nunanu, which docked
at the Spreckels Sugar Refinery to-day
after a run of 129 days from Honolulu.
After having encountered two severe
gales on the Pacific Ocean she was
stopped in the field Ice in the early part
of September while rounding Cape Horn
on her way to the Atlantic Ocean. Far
to the south the iÂ£e could be seen. The
sea was smooth and there was no sign
of land. The weather was fair at the
time and this enabled the Nunanu to
work her way into clear water.
Captain Josslyn, the vessel's master
calculated that the ice was about #)Â¦)
miles south of Cape Horn. The Nunanu's
run was over 14,000 miles. She is the first
of a fleet of sugar-laden sailing vessels
bound from the Hawaiian Islands to Phil
adelphia and New York, which, it is said,
are to displace steamers, which have
found the trade unprofitable owing to the
long run.
PAYS FOR SPREE
WITH HIS LIFE
Slave to Liquor Habit
Carries Out Threat
of Suicide.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Nov. B.â Charles Adams
ended a life wrecked by strong drink at
Saltese, Mont., yesterday by shooting
himself through the head. Adams was
generally credited with a peaceable dis
position, but when aroused by liquor he
is said to have been almost a demon.
Time and again he would reform and his
friends would extend a helping hand, only
to see him fall again.
In the summer of 1900 Adams was work
ing in the beet fields at Waverlv. One
day he became engaged in an altercation
in a saloon with John Gaston. A blow
from Adams' fist sent Gaston to the floor
and the stricken man died soon afterward.
Adams was charged with manslaughter.
At the trial he was acquitted, the jury
deciding that he had acted in self-defense.
Adams was admonished by Judge Ricn
ardson on his drinking habits and the
young man seemed deeply impressed.
When Adams left the jail ne went to
Waverly and little was heard of him un
til he appeared in Spokane a few weeks
later on a spree. Sheriff Cole took charge
of the man and allowed him to sleep in
the County Jail for a few nights. Adams
again made promises of reformation.
While in the jail he was exposed to small
pox and contracted che disease. Then lie
was sent to the Pesthouae, a county
charge.
Adams left the Pesthouse on January 5
full of intention to lead a better life.
He made a friend of Superintendent Hos
ier and the latter obtained a position fnr
the young man in a mine near Saltese,
Montana. Adams declared to Hosier be
fore leaving that if he ever took to drink
again he would kill himself. Yesterday
Mr. Hosier received word from Saltese
that Adams had shot himself through the
head while recovering from a spree.
TAX ON ARTICLES OF
GENERAL CONSUMPTION
How England May Raise Revenues
to Defray the Costs of
War.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â The London cor
respondent of the Tribune cables the fol
lowing regarding the financial policy of
Great Britain: The presence of the Chan
cellor of the Exchequer on the platform
is not desired by financiers for consols go
down whenever he speaks, although he
contents himself with reminding the tax
payers that war is an expensive business.
They are wondering, however, whether he
will increase the income tax in commem
oration of coronation year, or widen the
area of indirect taxation. The price of
consols is affected by the certainty that
there will be borrowing operations on a
large scale.
The Unionist press, under the leader
ship of the Times, is prepared to welcome
a revenue tariff on many articles' in addi
tion to sugar and coal. What Mr. Cham
berlain would do is an open secret â he
would take advantage of the opportunity
for restoring ft gt nerai tariff and con
verting it into an Imperial zollverein. on
lines suggested by his famous speech be
fore the Cana U flub a few years ago.
Sir Michael Hick*- Beach lacks both cour
age and breadth of mind for a complete
transformation if England's financial
policy. He watches revenue returns more
closely than anybody else, and is said to
be convinced that the resources of direct
taxation are piacttcally exhausted, with
evidence that lean years are following fat
years.
A Unionist member of Parliament is
authority for the statement that Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach will not take a
backward step, but will increase the
sugar duties ..-nd tax other articles of
general consumption.

PRESIDENT AND SENATOR HANNA
WORKING IN PERFECT HARMONY
Roosevelt and the Ohio Statesman in Ac
' cord on All Great Public Questions Ex
cept Concerning Legislation on Trusts
Special Dispatch to The Call.
jtt ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
,f N. W.. WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â
1 . This has been the most interest-
ing and possibly most important
day in the White House since
Roosevelt became President, because
Senator Mark Hanna of Ohio has fcr the
first time appeared upon the scene, has
been gTeeted by the President as an ar
fectionate son might greet a father, has
talked over matters of legislation with
important men in the administration and
has been entertained by the President at
dinner.
It would be putting it far too strongly to
say that the President and Senator Hanna
occupy the relations that President Mc-
Kinley and Senator Hanna did, but the
outcome of the visit of the Senator is that
he and the President thoroughly under
stand each other and each will have the
other's help. Coming on the heels of
Roosevelt's action In again upsetting the
Addicks machine in Delaware, to which
Senator Hanna had pledged his support
with the administration, this may seem
strange. It is nevertheless true that there
Is to be a strong community of interest
between the President and Senator Hanna
at this session of Congress at least.
Hanna Pledges Support.
Senator Hanr.a has pledged his heartiest
support to Roosevelt. The President will
consult Senator Hanna, as chairman of
the Republican National Committee, in
JILTED GIRL
HAS REVENGE
South Carolina Maid Pre
vents an Army Ap
pointment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â President
Roosevelt has decided that a man who
jilts a girl is. not entitled to an appoint
ment in the army, as such conduct may
be properly termed ungentlemanly, and
contrary to the beat interests of the ser
vice. He therefore refused to appoint for
mer Lieutenant William P. Crawford of
Camden, S. C, second lieutenant in the
regular army and thereby satisfied the
girl's friends, who have made a deter
mined fight against the young man's ap
pointment.
There is nothing against young Craw
ford on file save the fact that he refused
to marry the young woman to whom he
was engaged, and there would have been
no obstacle in the way of his appointment
had she not permitted her relatives and
friends to protest against his selection.
Cards Out for Wedding.
The case has caused considerable stir
at the War Department. Crawford served
during the war with Spain as a captain
of volunteers. He had a most creditable
record and was slated for appointment
last summer as second lieutenant of in
fantry along with hundreds of other
young officers serving in the Philippines.
When he became engaged to Miss Re
becca Douglass, of Camden, S. C the
wedding day was named, cards were is
sued and presents began to be received.
It was said that Crawford, who was the
publisher of a small newspaper in his
town, told his friends that unless he was
appointed he could not marry. His in
fluence in Washington seemed to insure
his selection and all his plans, therefore,
were completed for the event. Suddenly
Crawford changed his mind and told the
mother of the young woman he would
not marry her daughter, but assigned no
good reason for his change of purpose.
Conduct Not Gentlemanly.
Then it was that pressure was brought
on the authorities here to prevent his
being commissioned on the ground that
if he was guilty of such conduct he was
not entitled to associate with officers of
the army. Politicians and other influen
tial people of South Carolina took the
case up and brought it directly to the
President's attention.
The case is considered by the War De
partment officials as unique and is be
lieved to be the first on record where a
protest against the selection of an appli
cant for commissioned rank has been
based on precisely these grounds.
FIND GOLDEN ORE
ON FEDERAL GROUND
Precious Metal Discovered on the Site
of a Proposed Government
Building.
HELENA. Mont.. Nov. B.â A ledge of
free milling gold ore was struck to-day
while men were grading the foundation
for the United States federal building,
which is now under construction. The
ledge is a strong one of iron-staine 1
quartz containing free milling gold. The
Government when letting the contract
for the Government building explicitly
stipulated that any finds of mineral made
by the contractor should go to the Gov
ernment. This is the second strike of
rich ore made within the Helena city Hm
its within the last thirty days. The
ground through which the ledge runs is
in the best residence district of Helena.
Surrenders to the Sheriff.
SEVIERVILLH. Term., Nov. B.â Bob
Cattlett has given himself up to the Sher
iff of Sevier County to answer the charge
of being an accomplice in the murder o*
William Whaley and wife in 1897. Plea
Wynn and Catilett Tipton were hanged
in July, 1899, as the principals in the
crime, and it was charged that Bob Catt
lett had paid them a sum of money to get

He knows that his sufferings are very

What he voanU to know Is what will per-

matters of party policy. On large ques
tions the two men appear to be together,
with the possible exception of how trusia
are to be treated. Even this difference
may be reconciled. This exception con
stitutes the very important news of Sena
tor Hanna's visit. The great Ohio man
ager satd in the campaign of 1900. Thera
are no trusts." He holds that great in
dustrial combinations are the natural out
growth of national prosperity and are
essential to America's fight for supremacy
in the markets of the world. He would
let matters go on just aa they are with
out saying anything to Congress about
trusts and without seeking to curb them
or meddle with them in any way. Â»,
President Roosevelt ia of the impressionf J
that Congress ought to do somethi
not in the way of regulating trusr
least in the way of making it posaib.a
for investors to know exactly the s<
securities they are buying when they put
their money in industrials. It is the pur
pose of the" President, unless convnv
its inexpediency, to deal with this ques
tion in his message to Congress. He has
been devoting much time to getting; in
formation about corporations.
No one expects that Roosevelt will fa
vor legislation to break up trusts and
other great combinations, but he Is ex
pected to bear down very severely on cer
tain methods pursued by many persons
and to make recorrimendations that, in
his opinion, will improve conditions and
protect the public.
Harmony on Legislation.
As to all other questions there is ap
parent harmony between Senator Hanna
and President Roosevelt.
Roosevelt Is in favor of carrying: out
President McKinley's policy of reciproc
ity. Treaties that were before the last
Senate, with some additional conventions,
will be pressed in the Senate.
President Roosevelt is in favor of the
new Hay-Pauncefote treaty now bein*
negotiated. Senator Hanna is expected t >
aid that treaty in every way. President
Roosevelt is not convinced of the wisdom
of opening up the question of tariff re
vision. Senator Hanna will try to per
suade the President that the tariff should
not be touched, and he will not hays
much trouble in doing it.
President Roosevelt and Senator Hanna
stand together on the question of an isth- *
mian canal, which was indorsed in the
Republican national platform adopted in
Philadelphia.

A Daily Nuisance
A Simple Remedy Which Will In-
\_ terest Catarrh Sufferers.
In its earlier stage* catarrh Is more of
a nuisance than a menace to the general
health, but sooner or later, the diseaM
extends to the throat, bronchial tubes
and even -to the stomach and intestines.
Catarrh is essentially a disease of the*
mucous membrane, the local symptoms
being a profuse discharge of mucus,
stoppage of the nostrils, Irritation in
throat, causing coughing, sneezing, gag-
\ ging and frequent clearings of the threat
and ' head.
' The usual treatment by local douches,
snuffs, salves, etc., often gives temporary
relief, but anything like a cure can only
be obtained by a treatment which removes
the catarrhal taint from the blood and
the disappearance of ' the inflammation
from the mucous surfaces.
A new remedy which meets these re-
quirements and which so far ha 3. been re-
markably successful in curing catarrh la
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
These tablets act upon the blood and
mucous membranes only. They can hard-
ly be called . a secret patent medicine as
they are -composed of such valuable rem-
edies as Sanguinaria, Hydrastin, Eucalyp-
tol and similar cleansing antiseptics which
cure by eliminating from the blood and *
mucous surfaces the catarrhal poison.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are" large
pleasant tasting lozenges taken internally
allowing them to dissolve slowly In the
mouth; in this way they reach the throat
fauces and the entire alimentary canal *
If desired, they may also be dissolved
in water and used as a douche. In addi-
tion to the internal use, but it is not at
all necessary to use a douche; a few of
them dissolved in the mouth daily will
be sufficient. However, . when there la
much stoppage of the. nose, a douche
made from these tablets will give imme-
diate relief, but the regular daily use in-
ternally of these tablets will cure the
whole catarrhal trouble without resortinir
to the inconvenience of a douche
Dr. Bement states "that the internal
treatment for catarrh is rapidly taking
the place of the old- plan of douching and
local application and further says z
probably the best and certainly the safest
remedy at present on the market Is Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets, as no secret Is
made of their composition and all thÂ©
really efficient remedies for catarrh ara
contaired in this tablet."
Druggists sell- Stuart's Catarrh Tablet*
;at fifty cents for full sized packages. Ask
your druggist and if he is honest he will
tell you there i* no safer, more palatable,
more efficient and convenient remedy ca
the market.

Tie Victim to a Tree.
PHOENIX. Ariz., Nov. B.â An unusual
case of highway robbery occurred twelve
miles from Mayer, a little town in the
Bradshaw Mountains. Monday afternoon
when two Mexican.* held up Matt Welch,
and relieving him of $50 in cash, tied him
to a tree and made their escape. It was
several hours into the night when Welch
succeeded in freeing himself from the
ropes that held him. He traveled to
Mayer, which is the nearest telegraph
point, and informed the Sheriff at Pres
cott. A posse is scouring the hills for
the highwaymen.
CALVE APPEARS
UNDER PROTEST
Only Urgent Pleading
Induces Her to
Sing.
Special Dispatch to The Csu\.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.â The Herald
says: We did not see or hear Calve at
her best. She was palpably "off color."
The secrets of a prima donna's entour
age are as jealousiy guarded as the in
trigues of a court, but it is perfectly true
that Calve was induced to appear last
night only by the most urgent pleas.
Calve is not used to transcontinental
travel, and the trip from New Orleans to
Los Angeles, after a weeks indisposition
in the south, exhausted her strength or
at least racked those nerves which are
supposed to v be inseparable from the high
est strung artistic temperament.
The prima donna's throat troubled her
yestercay morning, and she did not want
to sing in the evening. Fritzi Scheff. orig
maJly bmtd to sing Micaela, was also
under the doctor's care. And so the man
agement, with Napoleon Grau 50C miles
Â«iway. was at its wit's end
.Finally Calve yielded, and, in a.! Jos
tice, it must be said, she tried to earn
her night's wage. But she was at pains
to let the audience into at least a shaie
of her troubles. In the first act sht be
haved bravely, and, while she did not tax
her voice, was far from being the disap
pointment that she subsequently proved
In the second act something hart agaii'
disturbed mademoiselle's nerves. She even
left the stage for a few seconds, pr. sum
ably to protest against a draft that blew
across the stage. Calve never once reallr
aroused her house, and, sensitive person
that she is, she was quick enough to re
alize it.
Campanari received an ovation after
the toreador song and fairly won the hon
ors of the evening, dividing a share o'
them with Marylli, who. as Micaela
made a most favorable impression with
a voice of rare clearness and beauty
These incidents, obviously enough did
not add to Calves satisfaction with her
self.or with her audience.
Charged With Murder.
Richard Menander. longshoreman, who
is charged with murder, appeared before
Judge Cabaniss in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday and was Instructed as to his
rights. As no complaint was on file, the
case was continued till November 35 Men
ander is accused of fatally stabbing Frenz
E. Paterson. a marine painter, in a sa
loon ait Battery and Sansome streets.
Eesidence Entered by Burglar.
The residence of Herbert Dyer, 315 Lo
cust avenue, was entered by a burglar
Thursday night. The only thing stolen
was a pair of trousers, containing a buncn
of keys. Mrs. Dyer found the front door
partly open yesterday morning, and it is
supposed the burglar had opened the door
with the aid of a skeleton key.

What Was Due the Professor.
She was a normal school girl and had
taken the regents' examination in Latin.
Comely, well-dressed, alert, and rather
"proper" in her mannerisms, she woui-1
no doubt take great offense if told that
she was so addicted to slang that she
dropped into it without having any more
than a subconscious knowledge of the
fact. And yet this is what happened. The
examination was ever and the papers
were being collected.
"Miss ," said the chief examiner to
the young woman-, "did you not look on
Miss 's paper for answers to these
questions?"
"No, sir," snapped the girl, with eyes
ablaze.
"Well. Professor thought he saw
you do so."
"Well. Professor has another think
coming," retorted the candidate, who ex
pects some day to have in her care a part
of the growing population of New York
City.â New York Times.
High Ocean Waves.
Some interesting details as to the
height of waves recorded on the east
coast of Scotland have Just been com
municated to the Institution of Civil En
gineers by William Shield, the engineer
at the Peterhead harbor works, where
the records were taken. During a storm
from the southeast, veering to east
southeast, the velocity of the wind rose
from fifty-seven to eighty-nine miles per
hour witlfln the thirtv-slx hours. The
waves, carefully measured by instru
ments, were found to be irregular both
as to height and length, but wave after
wave passed, having its crest quite un
broken, fully twenty-two feet six inches
above the still-water level. Assuming
the troughs to be as far below the still
water level as their crest was above it
the height of the waves would thus be
forty-five feet.
An Athletic Queen.
The Queen of Portugal is probably the
most athletic Queen in the world. She
greatly enjoys an oceaji swim, and nearly
every morning during the hot weather,
when at home, she may be seen at Cas
caes. swimming farther out to sea than
any one else. She may almost be counted
as an English woman, for she was born
thirty-six years ago at Twickenham,
where her mother went to live when her
father was banished from France.
"Did that impudent young man call
here during my absence, Maria?"
"Yes, papa."
"He did! Well, all I've got to say is
that he is as stupid as old Cervera. He
made a mistake and he ought 'to be
ashamed of it."
"A mistake, father?"
"Yes, a mistake. It's just as Adm'ra 1
Sampson saysâ had no business to leal
me to believe he would come at some
other time, and then come as soon as i
left home. He's a regular Cervera, .that's
what he Is!"â Cleveland Plain Dealer.
"What makes you so positive that he Is
from the country?" asked the first Brook
lyn girl.
"Well." responded the second Brookyln

GENTLY REARED
WOMAN'S PLUCK
Mary Clagett Opens a
Barber Shop in
Spokane.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Nov. B.â Mary Clagett,
daughter of the late Judge Clagett, has
opened a barber shop in Spokane â the only
woman's shop in Washington. By the
laws of the International Barbers' Union
she is barred from entering the union. She
recently applied and was refused admis
sion.
The little woman comes of a distin
guished family. She is a daughter of the
late Judge William H. Clagett of this city,
who wa.s one of the best-known men of
the West and whose fame as a lawyer
and political orator has been told around
many a campiire since the days of '49.
Judge Clagett once presented a certificate
of election to the Senate of the United
States, but was not seated, owing to a
technicality in His election. The place
went to Fred Dubois. Judge Clagett rep
resented Montana in Congress at one
term.
Miss Clagett had learned the barber
trade in Chicago. After her father's deatn
she came here and sought work, though
her family strongly objected to this
means of her earning a living.
"I don't blame the boys in the local
union for barring me out," says she. "I:
is a rule of their international union an 1
they have no voice in the matter. Many
of them have been most kind to me per
sonally, but the shops here employ none
but members of the union, and the union
will not let me in. It was as a last resort
that I opened this shop of my own. I
couldn't do anything else â I had to mak;
a living and barbering is my trade. It is
the only thing I can work at."

Shipping Silver to Mexico.
It is an instance of carrying coals to
Newcastle that refined silver is now being 1
shipped in considerable quantities from
the United States to the neighboring re
public of Mexico, whose silver production
is very large. It comes abont by the fact
that excessive exportations of silver coin
from Mexico to the Orient has caused a
decided stringency in the Mexican money
market. Many of the banks felt the
effect, and it was difficult to obtain lonr.P
For a time a scarcity of silver in Mexico
caused a rise in the price of coined silver
but now the demand is better supplied'
and the money condition has been re
lieved. Mexico has the right of way in
supplying the people of China, Japan the
Philippines and India, and, in fact, ali the
East with silver coinage. The people of
Asia seem to have unlimited confidence in
the integrity of Mexican coinage.â New

SLAYER FLEES

Tug Carries Officers in
Pursuit of a Mur
derer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. B.â Tom Netes,
a Greek fisherman, was murdered early
this morning. He was stabbed to death by
Frank Nicholas, another Greek fisherman,
who, like himself, lived in one of the
shacks clustered on Turret Rock, fronting
the upper harbor. The body of the mur
dered man, who died in less than a half
hour after the constables brought him
to the city lock-up, lies at the City Morgue
and out on the water of the straits the
murderer is endeavoring to escape in his
hshing sloop from constables Tvho are
pursuing on the tug Sadie. So far he has
eluded the officers, but It Is hardly likely
that he will escape.
The tragedy was the result of a quarrel
between the two fishermen. The men were
seen fighting by another fisherman, who,
with the brother of the murdered man,
is assisting in the search for the murderer.
The police believe Nctes was intoxi
cated when they found him, but when they
reached the station it was found that he
was wounded In the abdomen. He fell
back dead just as his brother came in and
clasped him In his arms.

Meredith Dazed When
Fatal Shots Are
Fired.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. B.â Testimony to-day
in the trial of John W. Considine for the
murder of ex-Chief of Police Meredith
was devoted to the â¢ fatal struggle in
Guy's drug store on June 25, several wit
nesses testifying that Meredith had been
rendered dazed and helpless by the blows
rained upon his head by Thomas Consi
dine and had lost motive and reasoning
power when John Considine fired the
fatal shot. Evidence as to the interval
between Meredith's last shot and Consi
dine's first was conflicting, but the whole
tended to show that Meredith's hands
were hanging at. his side and he was lean
ing against a showcase when John
pressed close to him and fired three shots
in quick succession into his body.
H. M. Hammond, the missing telegraph
operator, who will testify to a first shot
outside the drug store, arrived to-night
YAQUI SIGNAL FIRES BURNING
ON MOUNTAINS NEAR GUAYMAS
Citizens of the Mexican Town, Fearing a Night
Attack, Post Scouts on Surrounding Hills

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Ariz.. Nov. B.â Great fires
I have been burning upon the moun
tains surrounding Guaymas this
il week, according to Correo de So
nora, a Mexican paper, which ar
rived to-day. The city is illuminated by
night and ominous sounds are heard from
the mountains, where hundreds of Yaqui
braves are holding weird ceremonies over
their dead, killed in La Tuna Canyon by
Mexican cavalry during the recent battle.
A large posse has been stationed at a
point where the approach of the Indians
upon the town can be seen and warning
given in case an attack is attempted dur
ing the night.
The Indians have kept up a continual
warfare, raiding ranches and driving off
horses and cattle. Women who go to the
river every day to wash clothing were at
tacked and their clothing stolen by In
dians. Ranches have been desolated, and
there is scarcely a horse left at the ha
ciendas, all of them having fallen into
the hands of the Yaquis. The Indians
have stolen sufficient corn and other pro
visions to last them many months and

British Columbia's wealthiest family, has
entered an action against her son, Hon.

SAN RAFAEL, Nov. B.â lt took a jury
about ten minutes in Judge Angellotti's
court here this afternoon to decide that
the county was nor. indebted to the con
stables and justices of Sausalito for work
performed by them in catching tramps.
The suit against the county was for
claims aggregating m.ire than $1000. The
trial lasted several days and the methods
of tramp catching were fully exploited.
In his charge to the jury this afternoon
Judge Angellotti disposed of about $SOO of
the claims by ruling that the justices
could not recover fees when their records
were incomplete or when they had sim
ply ordered a man to leave town.

SLUMMING TOUR
PROVES SUCCESS
Proprietor of Pabst Cafe
in San Jose Is
Convicted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Nov. S.â After ten minutes'
deliberation to-night a jury in Justice
Cobb't; court found H. L. Hirsch, proprie
tor of the Pabst Cafe, guilty of violating
the ordinance imposing a license on con
cert halls.
Greater interest centered in this ca.Â«e
than in any Justice Court affair tried
here in years. For more than a year
Hirsch had refused to pay a license for
the concert hall attachment to his. sa
loon. The resort finally became so noto
rious that it was denounced from tha
church pulpit and public sentiment caused
it to close. Then City Treasurer Mc-
Geoghcgan bad Hirsch arrested for vio
lating the license ordinance. Two days
were occupied in selecting a jury, which
was composed of business men.
Rev. Dr. MacLaren of the Second Pres
byterian Church was a witness against
Hirsch. He said he had gone on a slum
ming tour at the request of some of his
congregation to investigate the character
of the resort. He had found gambling
running full blast, a "ladies' orchestra"
rendering music and youths and women
drinking. Dr. MacLaren said the place
was a vile den.
Hirsch will be sentenced on Wednesday
morning.
IMPROVED OUTLOOK
IN WALL STREET
Early Agreement Will Insure Peace
in Northwestern Bail
road Circles.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â The conviction
has crystallized in Wall street that an
agreement will be arrived at which will
insure peace between the contestants in
the Northwestern Railroad territory and
will untie the hands of capitalists who
have been obliged to lock up enormous
capital in the struggle for control of the
Northern Pacific and the Burlington.
Reports of great activity in iron and
steel, of large percentage increases in
railroad gross earnings for the fourth
week in October and continued heavy
traffic and of good trade in general helped
rising prices. Large receipts of Aus
tralian and Klondike gold have offset
withdrawal for export, and treasury
bond redemptions have kept pace wltli
the Government surplus, thus keeping In
abeya'nee any anxiety over the money
market. Activity has greatly Increased
both in stocks and bonds and prices hayÂ«
risen.
Caliahan Declared Not Guilty.
OMAHA. Neb.. Nov. B.â The jury in the
case of James Caliahan, after being out
thiriy-six hours, brought in a verdict at
10 o'clock to-night, finding the defendant
not guilty, and the prisoner was dis
charged. This is the last echo in the Cud
ahy kidnaping case, and Caliahan is ac
quitted of the kidnaping charge. It was
said to-night that there was little to pre
vent Pat Crowe from coming to Omaha.
The evidence on which Caliahan has been
tried would probably prevail in case of
Crowe being tried on the same charges,
and County Attorney Shields to-night
gave it as his opinion that Crowe would
now return.
Chinese Soldiers' Rewards.
Rewards are seldom given for prowesa
on the battlefield in China, but when they
are the most acceptable of them all. from
the private soldier's point of view, is a
sack of rice, valued at about $15 50. The
commanding officer of each regiment has
power to give as many sacks as are de
served, and at the conclusion of every
campaign he sends in a formidable bill to
the Government for rice. No inquiries are
made, nor are the names of the recipient*
asked for, so in nine cases out of ten thÂ«
officer sells the grain and puts the money
into his own pocket, while the deserving
soldier, to whom the rice would have
meant a good deal, has to go without.â

A Reformed River.
Naturally, th ; fact which first rivets at
tention in tht story of the steamboat
fcteward who was arrested for throwing
the remnants c: a meal into the Chicago
i-.ivtr and thu* contaminating 4t is that
the story is true. The arrest was not
made In a facetious spirit by a praciticai
joker. It was ;>n official act "pertormed in
earnest. The theory that the river
had been subjected to contaminating in
l.uences calculated to lessen its purity
was not propounded in a spirit of sarcasm
Lut as a fact.
Considering that only two short years
ago It was not believed tnat thert" was
any known substance which could con
taminate the Chicago River, it is now
le to form som .st!ma;e of the
marvelous change which has been
wrought in that regenerate stream. 'I hen
it was not the river but the thing that
went into it that suffered contamination.
]t was simpiy impossible to impair its
purity, because- it haa none. Refuse
mrown into it trom shore was popularly
believed to improve its general character
us a river. Taking note of the sweeping
l.ature of the change which has been
made in so short a time, the possibilities
*he future condition of the river are
not even yet foreseen. It is not wildly
\:sionary to imagine a day when vessel
owners will be forbidden to sail into the
harbor unless they have had their ships
thoroughly cleansed and treated with an
usepucs. and persons who fall into the
nver will br fined on the charge of defil
ing its purity.

Branch Dead Letter Office.
More than 10,000 letters mailed at the lo
<al delivery at Chicago are t?em to tne
'ever office at Washington every
month. The Postmaster of Chicagoâ who,
by the way. ha<= only been in the office a
tev. monthsâ has ventured to suggest to
iÂ£f- Postmaster Genera! that the aead let
ter office at Washington he decentralized
establishment of a branch dead let
ter office in all the principal postofnees of
the country. We doubt very much wheth
er the puggestkn will meet with favor
able consideration. There is no saving to
fleeted by the scheme, but. on the
contrary, it would involve- greater outlay
than if now incurred by the Government.
AVhile it might enable the Postmaster
â¢ al to do away with a small part of
the force employed in the dead letter of
fice, it would involve the employment of
additional clerks in every important post
effief- that would be designated as a
branch. The additional expense to be in

saving on pound ratos paid by the "Gov

Not Discharged by Bankruptcy.
Two courts, one in Illinois and the
ether in Massachusetts, have recently de
cided that alimony to a divorced wife is
an obligation that cannot be discharged in
bankruptcy proceedings. The Illinois
Judge lays down the matter succinctly
and convincingly in the following words:
"Alimony cannot be regarded as a debt
owing from the husband to the wife,
which may be discharged by an order in
bankruptcy, whether the alimony accrues
before or after the bankruptcy proceed
ings. The duty which the law Imposes
upon a husband and father to support his
wife and children is not such a debt as is
contemplated by the bankruptcy act. It Is
a social obligation as well as a pecuniary
liability: it is founded upon public policy
end is for the good of society." â Newark

SAUSALITO COMES TO THE FORE
AS AN UP-TO-DATE BAY RESORT
Sea Serpent of the "Genuine" Variety Makes Its Ap
pearance and Pursues a Luckless Swimmer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN" RAFAEL, Nov. S.â A "genuine" sea serpent has made its appearance off the shore of Sausalito and as a
consequence E. H. Shoemaker, superintendent of the Narrow Gauge Railroad, has given up swimming in the
cooling brine.
Several days ago Mr. Shoemaker had the distinction of holding close communion with the monster of the
deep. It was a race for life and the railroad man won.
For years Mr. Shoemaker has been In the habit of taking an occasional swim in the bay at Sausalita. While
thus engaged several clays ago his attention was attracted by the warning cries of some men in a nearby boat. At
that instant a dark object surged past him like a submarine boat. Mr. Shoemaker struck out for the shore. The
monster circled around him, passing back very close to the now rapidly swimming man. As Mr. Shoemaker reached
the shallow water on the beach and looked back he beheld a sight that made his blood run cold. The strange &ea
creature, whatever it was. was directly behind him, snapping its alligator-like jaws and struggling to reach him.
After lashing the water for a while In its fury it departed.
Mr. Shoemaker says that It was not a shark. It was about twenty feet long and had a head exactly like an
alligator, with great jaws filled with heavy teeth.
The good people of Sausalito are well up on both land and water sharks and most other sea monsters, but this
freak of the ocean is a "new one on them."

SUGAR FACTORY
NEAR TEHAMA
Vast Tracts Will Be
Devoted to Beet
Culture.
Â Special' Dispatch to The Call.
_ REDDING. Nov. 8.-Tne people of Te
hama County are. congratulating them
selves upon the fact that a large beet
sugar factory Is soon to be built near
Tenama. The speculation and experi
ments of the past year, appear to have
crystallized into action that will have
the , factory complete in time to handle
the beet crop of next season. John Fin
nell, who, with his sons, owns the Finnell
tract of 20,000 acres near Tehaina, is in
ban Francisco, where he is - said to be
concluding arrangements with the com
pany that will build the factory. Con
tractors are on the ground at Tehama.
nguring en the construction of the build
fi. I* is b 4 elieved that Dwyer Brothers
L the American Sugar Company are the
men who will build the factory, because
they were merely waiting for the Ala
meda Sugar Company to gather its crop
en the Finnell tract and give up posses
sion before entering into a contract with
the runnells.
The establishment of a factory and re

Vulcan Furnaces j
Successfully Dunning I
The recent marked successes of the VULCAN SMELTING AND REFINING
COMPANY In the operation of their furnaces have created considerable excitement
in the mlninx and metallurgical world. The Vulcan smelter is an innovation in the
methods for reducing ores by the smelting process, in that they do away with all
machinery used in connection with the blast type of furnace and in place of a positive
blast use a suction draught caused by the introduction of a jet of steam, intro-
duced immediately underneath the gas outlets of the stack, thus forming a vacuum
immediately over the smelting zone, the intake of air being through an annular
opening all # around the furnace, between the crucible and the upper part of the
stack and immediately underneath the smelting zone, thus giving a generally dis-
tributed roasting atmosphere permeating- the entire charge in the furnace the result
of which is the wonderful oxidizing action, which permits of taking raw sulphide
ores as they come from the mine (without previous roasting to desulphurize) and
burning off the sulphur in the furnace, making use of the fuel values of the sulphur
as a reducing agent.
During the Nevada State Fair at Reno, held from the 18th to the 21st of last
September, the Vulcan Company had one of its plants on exhibition Just outside the
Fair Grounds and treated all ores offered for treatment for test runs. Among the
ores treated were the following: A copper carbonate ore, carrying lead carbonate 11
per cent copper and about 42 per cent silica: 10 per cent coke was used, with a steam
pressure of 40 pounds. Furnace ran fast and hot and product was a bullion assay! ne
85 per cent copper, with balance lead, with some of the usual impurities of black cop-
per and carrying the gold and silver values.
A quartzose ore carrying about 2 per cent iron, 21 per cent silica and about 20
per cent <-orÂ»per in the form of a gray copper sulphide, with approximately 2 per
cent of the copper In the form of a carbonate, and the balance consisting of clayey
matter (alumina).
The flux used was an oxidized Iron ore (gossan) carrying about $3 50 in gold con-
siderable silica and some alumina. Fuel used, 9 per cent coke. Furnace ran hot
and slag liquid. Product consisted of black copper of about 94 per cent fineness, with
6 per cent of the product in the form of a hlch grade matte (blue metal) as a top
layer over bars. Slags assayed 9-10 of 1 per cent copi>er.
Ore No. BâThis8 â This ore was a quartz ore carrying oxides and carbonates of copper
9 per cent iron and 48 per cent silica, with some basic material. It ran about the same
as ore No; 2, the product being black copper of about 55 per rent purity, with no
matte production. Ccke used, 10 per cent on charge. Furnace bottom kept hot and
tapped easily.
Since the above runs were made the company has had a furnace in operation tn
Los Angeles, treating ores from that section of the State and from Arizona with even
better results than were produced at Reno.
The ability of the Vulcan furnace to take raw sulphide ores and pass them through
the furnace without previously desulphurizing and turn out high-grade cooDer bill
lion, in addition to the small cost of installation and maintenance after installation
bids fair to revolutionize the mining and smelting industry. For full information and

STEAMER SINKS
WITH HER CREW
Forty- Nine Men Perish
on the Tsurohika
Maru.
Only One Sailor of the Jap
anese Vessel Gains
the Shore.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. Nov. B.â The steamer
Adelaide, which arrived from the Orient
to-day, brought news of the loss of the
2000-ton Japanese steamer Tsurohika
Maru, owned by Ohkura & Co. of Tokio.
All hands were lost excepting one man
of her crew of fifty, who was washed
ashore on the wreckage at Fukuye and
who gave news of the disaster.
After taking on coal at Moji, the Tsuro
hika cleared early on the 6th for Keelung.
On the morning of the 7th she went ashore
on Mejima island, Goto Archipelago, ana
became a total wreck.
The cargo consisted of two locomotives
for the Formosan Railway and a large
quantity of miscellaneous goods. The ves
sel was bought in February, last, for 130,
00 yen. ...a.:,
The scene of the wreck Is an island
about fifrv miles from the Fukuye, Coto
lÂ«land. There were no passengers on the
steamer, me torpedo Doat destroyer Mu
rakumo left Sasebo for the scene of the
disaster. The Sasebo naval station au
thorities were awaiting intelligence in the
signal house at Ose. Goto island, before
dispatching further assistance, when the
Queen Adelaide left Kobe.
Mexican Aristocrats.
The cultivated Mexican, priding himself
on his "educacion," looks for its manifes
tations in the person who claims his
frifndship and intimacy. He insists on
good breeding among his own people, or
thty may not pass his threshold; all the
n^ofe Is he likely to Insist that the for
eigner who would visit him be a man of
pel sh and with the ability to say and
do things the ricrht way.
A Mexican of excellent family was say
ing to me the other day that going to an
interior state he had sojourned at a ha
cienda where the men there assembled,
on engineering and other matters, were
not of his kind, and "so I did not eat at
the same table," for they were not "ca
balleros," or gentlemen. "I demand
brains and good breeding in my asso
cis>tes, or T live alone!"
This gentleman speaks English perfectly
and reads our best authors and he is
equally well grounded in other foreign
ljirguages. He has none of that snobbish
pride that offends, -would not hurt an
other's felings and does not insist on
nicety of dress, but does demand of his
associates that fine breeding and perfect
tact that characterize people who have in
herited the courtly traditions of old Spain.
It struck me that he went too far, that
the technically trained men he met in the
country were quite good enough to asso
ciate with, but to all objections he would
roply: "They were not of my kind!"
A Mexican lady of the old nobility of
the country, wealthy and of long resi
dence abroad, witty, of linguistic accom
plishments and much social experience in
Europe as* at home, said:
"I do not invite foreigners to my table,
not even diplomats, for they are too criti
cal of the service, and here you know
that It is impossible to have such well
trained servants as in France or England.
I have been hurt in my feelings at my
own table at the uuiet amusement of
guests when something went wrong,
some blunder in service. And. as for
eigners will make no allowances for our
domestic shortcomings. I close my doors
to them. In Paris I should entertain for
eigners, for there I could be sure of my
servants. But we Mexicans do not want
to bt- laughed at. and that, perhaps, by
people who are not at home, in their own
countries, of our class. One does not
know who they are or what is their origin.
The lower their extraction the greater
their presumption here."
Definition of Mugwump.
The late Secretary Evarts liked fun, and
there was a dry wit in his public utter
ances at times that nearly convulsed those
who clearly understood his meaning. It
was almost impossible for him to avoid
being deep, even in humor, and many a
good fling at political opponents was lost
because he talked above the heads of his
audience, or because his sentences were
too involved. At the time when the Mug
wumps were just beginning to show their
teeth he delivered one of his long political
speeches from the stage of the Grand
Opera-house and in "the course of it re
marked that he believed the Republican
party need not fear the Mugwumps, as the
latter were only a lot of "marsupials."'
Some 3500 men heard the word, and after
the meeting groups got together to discuss
the meaning of It and its application.
Some went home to look in their diction
aries, while others called on Mr. Evarts
for an explanation. "Marsupials," said
he, "are born extremely small, imperfect
and quite helpless, and have to be carried
in pouches on the bellies of their moth
ers."âPittsburg Press.
The Forbidden Fruit.
A fruit supposed to bear the mark of
Eve's teeth is one of the many botanical
curiosities of Ceylon. The tree on which
it grows is known by the significant
name of "the forbidden fruit," or "Eve's
apple tree." The blossom has a very
pleasant scent, but the really remark
able feature of the tree, the one to which
it owes its name, Is the fruit. It is beau
tiful and hangs from the tree in a pe
culiar manner. Orange on the outside
and deep crimson within, each fruit has
the appearance of having had a piece
bitten out of it. This fact, together with
its poisonous quality, led the Mohamme
dans to represent it as the forbidden
fruit of the Garden of Eden and to warn
men against Its noxious properties. The
mark upon the fruit is attributed to Eve.
Why the bite of Adam did not also leave
its mork is not known, but as only one
piece seems to be missing Its loss is
ascribed to the womanâ Buffalo Commer
cial.

Attorney General Ex

WASHINGTON. Nov. B.â The Cabinet
meeting to-day developed the fact that
there exists an entire misapprehension
concerning the legal proceedings which
are to take place in Chicago in the case
of Captain Oberlin M. Carter, who was
led by a court-martial of embez
zlement and sentenced to a term in the
penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kans.
Attorney General Knox said to the
President and Cabinet to-day that Cap
barter was not to be given a new
trial, as has been erroneously reported.
The Government has attached about $150,
â¢ the property belonging to Captain
Carter, and the question which will be
tried before Judge Kohlsaat relates only
lo the title of that property. Incidentally,
-rse, the question of Captain Car

ac raised, but Attorney General Knox

SCULPTOR DIES
IN AN ASYLUM
Adolph Krause, Famous
in the Art World,
Passes Away.
HYDE PARK, Mass., Nov. B.â Adolpn
F. Krause, the famous sculptor, died in
Danvers Insane Hospital last night.
Krause had been receiving treatment at
the institution since last July. He was 5i
years of age. A wife, four sons and two
daughters survive him.
A pensioner of the Prussian Govern
ment and winner of the grand prize of
Rome, the name of the sculptor was es
tablished in Europe before he came to
America, in 1881. In this country he con
tinued to win fame, and it was the disap
pointment of his ambition to produce a
masterpiece which is said to have caused
his mind to give way.
He had partially completed a model in
clay of a heroic figure of Belshazzar at
the moment of seeing the handwriting on
the wall when his mind became unbal
anced. Among his noted pieces in Amer
ica are the Theodore Parker and the Cris
pus at Tuck's monument. In the compe
tition for the lowa State soldiers' monu
ment he won the second prize. He was
the sculptor of the winged figures of Vic
tory that crowned the towers of Machin
cry Hall at the World's Fair at Chicago,
which received great praise.

FROST IS AFTER
LAWYER METSON
Says Detective Carson
Played Into His
Hands.
Attcrneys Wrangle Before
Circuit Court of
Appeals. â¢
William H. Metson, according to the
testimony adduced in the hearing of the
Nome contempt cases before Commis
sioner Heacock, has figured in vari
ous capacities since he visited the Nome
country. First he became renowned as a
gun tighter, then as a captain of detec
tives. Now comes young fiery Mr. Froit
and with sorrow in his heart says thai,
he was told by one Carson that Metsou
bore the reputation in California as a
jury fixer.
This Frost gave as testimony following
Metson's declarations against him. Frost
was all in a fume as he told how Carson,
the detective employed by Metson and
subsequently taken into his own service,
represented two different conditions ot
things. Frost insinuated that Metson was
the deluded one, and that Frost was too
wise to give credence to the preposterous
statements oÂ£ Carson.
Metson smiled at this testimony of the
special examiner, and Pillsbury was anx
ious for the cross-examination to begin.
He is now fairly started, and when the
morning session is finished to-day Frost
will have passed through an ordeal. Met
son announced his unequivocal antipathy
to C. A. S. Frost on Thursday. The bat
tle is now between the "gun fighter,"
chief of detectives and attorney, William
H. Metson, and C. A. S. Frost.
The proceedings of yesterday befor3
Judge Heacock were divided between tor
rid arguments lefore the Circuit Court oi
Appeals and the taking of Metson's ani
Frost's testimony before Commissioner
Heacock. Judge Noyes may go on the
stand this morning.
Go Before the Court.
The warmest tilt between the attorneys
occurred yesterday morning, and the
three Judges of me Circuit court of Ap
peals were present at the hearing. Tn<;
examination was proceeding slowly when
word was sent to Judge McLaughlin thai
the Circuit Court of Appeals desired hii
presence. Attorneys and all filed out of
one room and into the other, and then
the fun began.
The Circuit Court of Appeals desired f>
know when the testimony taking would
come to an end. Judge McLaughlin coul 1
not fix a date, and staled his many rea
sons for the slow pace at which tht: pro
ceedings were moving. Then Mr. Pills
bury, amlcus curiae, was called upon for
his statement. He cited the record as his
support in the charge that the respond
ents' attorneys wasted 'oceans of tim?,
and that the reason the case was drag
ging so painfully was of this wearisome
disregard of expeditious examination.
When Pillsbmy sat down McLaughlin
was on his feet. He was bristling wit.i
anger.
"If this is Intended as a lecture," he
said, "I shall tell Mr. Pillsbury now, ana
with all due respect to the court, that his
language Is certainly offensive. He says
he is entirely disinterested in this case.
If he is the record will not bear him out.
His manner and actions show more than
a duty to the court. He has been over
zealous in this case and the record will
show this."
After McLaughlin had finished Pills
bury called attention to 500 or more pages
nf needless objections, which he would
move to have *axed as costs upon the re
spondents. The heads of Judges Hawley. j
Gilbert and Morrow came together, and 1
they ordered the attorneys to expedite j
the taking of testimony and inform th->
court Monday morning WTien they wouH
be ready for a hearing.
Metson on the Old Road.
The first questions of the morning pro
ceedings were directed by the amicus cu
riae In the cross-examination of Metson
to the diversion of gold dust by McKen
zie. Try as they would, Metson and his
coworkers could secure nothing from
Juoge Noyes In the way of orders.
"McKenzie could and did get everything i
he wanted," said Metson, "and it was im
possible for us to get a ruling antagonis
tic to McKenzie. McKenzie was part
owner lr. 500 and more claims, most of
them by jumpers' title."
On redirect examination, Judge Mc-
Laughlin asked:
"Do you make a charge that McKenzie
tried to steal the $15,000 that you claim he
diverted?"
"I told Alexander McKejizie to his
teeth," answered the witness, "that he
went up there and tried to steal the whole
country. I say yes under the guise of
the law."
later on Judge McLaughlin asked:
"Did you ever offer or cause to be of
fered any money to Judge Noyes?"
"No, sir." said Metson decisively.
McLaughlin then carried Metson over
much of the ground that has been plowed
and harrowed again and again. Metson's
story was as firmly g|ven as on the for
mer occasion when he took the stand.
The conclusion of the examination of
the witness by Judge McLaughlin was
directed toward the interest of Metson in
the issuance of the writs. Pillsbury had
asked the witness for all possible assist
ance in the securing of testimony and it
was joyfully, willingly given.
Frost Is Very Warm.
After Metson came Frost. Attorney
Heney took the helm. His first request
to the witness was for a statement of
facts about Carson's report.
"I am anxious, now that Mr. Metson
ha? brought up the matter of these re
ports, to tell all about them," said Frost
He then retold the story of the rumors
about jury corruption, and declared that
this was the reason for the employment
of d&tectives. Frost said that Carson
fooled Metson just the same as he did
himself. The witness said:
"Mr. Carson came to me soon after he
was employed by me and said Metson was
an alleged lawyer; that he fixed juries,
and that 13 what he did in California. I
told him if that was so I wanted to get
at the bottom of it. I told him to pursue
his own methods. A little while after he
told me Metson wanted to employ him
in the jury business and by accepting the
offer he would get some valuable infor
mation. He reported from time to time
that Metson had men employed to inquire
about the men who were to go on the
jury to see who could be used. My effort
was to discover persons who attempted
to bribe jurors. I never interested my
self in any way in any of the cases."
"Why did you refrain from stating this
the other day?"- interrogated Heney.
"Mr. Heney, there has been much black
ening of character on hearsay in this
case," said Frost, "and I never would
have told this if Metson had not taken
Carson's word as truth. Â¦ I wish Carson
could be brought here."
The witness kept no copies of the re
ports, but placed them in a tin box in the
District Attorney's office.
Attorneys at "War.
Then Amicus Curiae Pillsbury took up
the cross-examination. He wanted to
know when and with whom Frost com
municated about the reports of the de
tectives. Frost was about to explain,
when Pillsbury held him to his question.
Judge McLaughlin jumped in and said the
witness had a right to explain. The ami
cus curiae thought this was unprofes
sionalâthe interruptionâ and he told Mc-
Laughlin so.
"Now, Mr. Pillsbury, I don't profess to
have you lecture me on what is what and
what is not professional!" shouted Mc-
Laughlin, looking savagely at the amicus
curiae, "and I warn you now to put an
end to it."
"Witness, answer the question," said
Pillsbury.
"Gentlemen," said Commissioner Hea
cock, "there is no occasion for this dis
play of anger, and please refrain from it
ip the future." The sjtorm forthwith sub
sided.
Breslauer Is Acquitted.
The case of Llpman Breslauer, wool
commission merchant, charged with fel
ony embezzlement on complaint of J. B.

DIMMICK ADMITS
USING THE COIN
Superintendent Narrates
Graphic Tale of
Guilt.
An Indulgent Father-in-Law
Sends Money to Help
Defendant.
Superintendcr.t Frank Leach of the
Mint told a damaging story under oata
yesterday in the United States District
Court about Walter N. Dlmmick, ex-chief
clerk of the Mint, on trial for embezzling
Government funds.
On February 4, 1901, according to Super
intendent Leach he called Dlmmick into
his office and ;nformed him that he de
sired to count $1338 97 which Dimmick's
books showed was in the chief clerk's of
flce in the safe. This money had been
received by Dimmick from the Selby
Smelting and Lead Works for bluestone.
one of the by-products of the Mint, sold
to the Selby Company. On the next morn
ing Dimmick came to Leach and said:
"Mr. Leach, for the first time in my life
I have told you a lie, and t could net
sleep last night thinking over it." Then
he confessed that he had used the money
for his own purposes. He said that he
would make it cood â that he was the cus
todian of the money and had always pro
duced it when called upon to do so; that
he was under bonds, and the Government
would not lose a dollar. Dimmick fol
lowed up this statement with what was
virtually a plea for mercy, saying that
he had been in debt for about $4000 and
that he had paid up $2000 of that debt out
of his earnings.
"I told him," continued Superintendent
Leach, "that whatever his purpose might
have been in using me money he ha-I
committed a criminal act. He told me
then that he expected to receive. $1500
from the sale of a life insurance policy
on March 5. I tola him that I could not
wait that long and that he would have
to get the money immediately. He then
said that he would write to his father-in
law for the money. He wrote, and a day
or two later lie showed me a telegram
from his father-in-law stating that after
he had received certain papers from Dim
mick he would send the money. I said to
him then that his ideas and mine with
regard to propriety and integrity were so
far apart that Ms relations witn the Mint
must cease, and that I would give him
three or four months to look out for an
other situation. He finally made good the
money on February 19."
Leach identified th^ seven receipts
which form the basis of the indictment
as being in the handwriting of Dimmick.
He testified further that Dimmick had
sole charge of the sales of by-products
to the Selby Smelting and Lead Com
pany.
After Ira T. Plackwood, assistant cash
ier of Selby's. had also identified the re
ceipted bills the court adjourned until
Monday.

"J. D. S." KILLS HIMSELF
IN GOLDEN GATE PARK
Unidentified Old Man Found Hang
ing by the Neck to Limb of
a-Tree.
Who is "J. D. S.?"
The body of an unidentified man about
60 years old, with the foregoing initials
in his hat, was found yesterday morning
hanging by the neck to a limb of a tree
in Golden Gate Park at the intersection
of Fifth avenue and McAllister street.
The remains were evidently those of a
laborer. The clothing was a cheap coat
and pants of brown checked goods, a
dotted vest of silk mixed goods, white
cotton shirt and collar and blue under
wear.
The suicide had used a common baling
rope, one end of which he had wounrt.
twice around the limb of the tree and
the other knotted around his neck.
A pearl handled knife, a nickel watch
with brass chain and a few dollars in sil
ver were found in the pockets of the
clothing. On the vest lapel was a photo
button containing his own portrait and
that of three young men.
Harry Ward, an engineer on the steamer
Enterprise, called at the Morgue last night
and stated he believed the body of the
suicide to be that of S. Jones, also a
steamship engineer. Ward said that
Jones came to the coast from Philadel
phia some time ago to take a position on
the steamship Sonoma. After that vessel
had made two trips to Sydney Jones was
discharged, and the loss of work brought
on despondency. Jones told Ward Sunday
evening that he expected to kill himself.

MEETS A GANG
OF BUNKO MEN
H. Lamotte, a Wealthy
Germam, Gets Valu
able Experience.
Succeeds in Making Escape
Without Parting With
His Coin.
Henry Lamotte, a young gentleman on
a pleasure tour from Germany, who has
apartments at the Palace Hotel, fell into
the hands of bunko men yesterday morn
ing, but fortunately escaped without part
ing with any of his coin.
He arrived Thursday and yesterday
morning went to the Bank of California
and drew $200. He had also a letter of
credit in his pocket for $2000. While walk
ing from the bank he was accosted by a
well-dressed young man, who asked him
to direct him to the PalacÂ« Hotel. He
said he was the son of the vice presi
dent of the National Bank in New York
and was a stranger in the city.
They entered into conversation and the
stranger suggested to Lamotte that he
should go and see the paintings in the
Hopkins Art Institute and said he had a
friend, a colonel, who would get them
a permit.
Lamotte was steered to 405 Geary street,
where he was introduced to a "judge"
and three others. The colonel was not
at home and the "judge" suggested a
game of California poker. They started
to play and Lamotte' s friend won, and
suggested he should take a hand. La
motte at first declined but finally was in
duced to play, his new-found friend giv
ing him money, as Lamotte declared he
had no money with him. He won and
he decided to go to the hotel and asiv
it the game was all right, telling the
bunko men that all his money was in his
trunk.
When he reached the hotel he>was told
to have nothing to do with the game and
then he consulted a friend who advised
him to notify the police. He went to po
lice headauarters and Policeman George
Collins went with him to 405 Geary street.
There they found Robert Tait, known
as the "Sheeny Kid"; "Judge" W. J.
Franklin, alias Foster, and George H.
Lawrence, all well-known bunko men.
They were placed under arrest and taken
to the City Prison. Lamotte's friend and
another of the gang had disappeared.

PARK COMMISSIONERS
TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS
Decide to Advance Wages of Skilled
Laborers From S2 to $2 50
Per Day.
At a meeting of the Park Commissioners
held Thursday afternoon it was decided
to improve the Japanese garden in Golden
Gate Park. Lakes and small streams will
be formed, walks will be laid and the gar
den will be further adorned with Japan
ese houses.
The park superintendent suggested in
his report that the museum building is In
need of repairs. To make the necessary
repairs the commissioners decided to ap
propriate $2500. For the improvement of
Franklin Square $3000 was set apart.
Professor Gruber reported that the col
lection of curios In the park museum has
recently received a valuable acquisition In
the nature of a collection of Japanese
fish and crabs. The collection was pre
sented by W. J. Sargent, a tourist.
In answer to the park laborers' petition
for an increase of wages from $2 to $2 50
per day, the commissioners decided that
there was not sufficient money in the park
fund to permit an increase in the salary
of all the laborers employed in the park.
It was determined, however, to grant the
required increase in the case of all skilled
laborers, such as teamsters and assistant
gardeners.

Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound can always be relied
upon to restore health to women who thus suffer. It is a sovereign
: cure for the worst forms of female complaints, that bearing down feeling,
weak back, falling and displacement of the womb, inflammation of the
ovaries and all troubles of the uterus or womb. It dissolves and expels
tumors from the "terus in the early stage of development and checks
any tendency to cancerous humors. It subdues excitability, nervous
I prostration, and tones up the entire female system.
Mrs. Pinkham especially invites young- girls to write her about
their sickness. She has made thousands of young sufferers happy.
Two young women authorize us to publish the following letters. <

FAILURE OF PRUNE BRANDY.
IT is to be regretted that the abundant experiments
made in prune brandy by Mr. Korbel have failed
to produce a merchantable liquor that can expect
v profitable market.
We fail to make use of our entire fruit crop in this
State. In European fruit districts there is much
closer use made oi everything. The vintage yields*
profitable by-products, and pits and parings of stone
fruits are made by distillation to reappear in some
form that prevents their waste. The many merchant
able liqueurs, as apricctine, distilled from apricots,
kirsch and others, represent the saving process of dis
tillation. If our prunes could have been used in the
1 tub profitably the surplus of a crop might have
been profnably disposed of in that way.
But the experiments of Mr. Korbel may yet be of
great importance to California as a suggestion. There
is a considerable importation of rig brandy into this â¢
country. It is a liqueur, used as such as a "coup" at
table, and is also a fine cooking liquor for sauces. It
is made in Greece, of capri and purple figs, and has
a market in Europe.
We are producing a surplus of purple and other
figs which do not require the blastophaga in pollina
tion. In many pans of the State these figs are used
in fattening hogs. They are a delicious fruit, but in
their fresh state do not bear long shipment, and there
fore are net an export crop.
A few years ago the distillation of fig brand}' was
begun here, but was forbidden by the internal rev
enue officers because it is not" mentioned in the law!
Unfortunately the few barrels that were distilled be
fore this important discovery was ma.de were de
stroyed by the officers, so there was no chance to
test it after aging.
There is no known reason, however, why our figs
should not make as fine an aromatic brandy as those
of Greece, and we are sure that California fig brandy
would find a profitable market in the United States
and some demand abroad.
As it is a local interest our members of Congress
can be relied on to get fig liquor into the revenue law,
and then, if Mr. Korbel will bring his skill ami"ex
perience to bear on its distillation, his work for'prune
brandy will not be wholly lost.
There seems to be no reason why we should not
also supply the American demand for apricotine.
The apricot is more generally distributed over the
State than the prune", and in full years not only must
there be a surplus over the demand for canning and
drying, but in all years there must be much fruit not
up to the standard required by either. This ought to
go to the still, as it does in France, and be saved in
stead of wasted.
Failure is the alphabet of success, and perhaps the
publicity given to Mr. Korbel's failure in prune
brandy may make him the real founder of profitable
uses for much that is now wasted.
It is stated that as a result of the invasion of China
â¢ the powers the industries of the country were so
Curbed that upward of 900,000 people arc now on
.he verge of starvation, so it would seem that in some
respects the processes of civilization are not widely
different from those of barbarism.
If the bandits who abducted Miss Stone were good
business men they would accept the ransom offered
and close the incident. By holding out for more they
may convince the authorities that it would be cheaper
to offer a reward for the capture of the bandits than
to try to ransom the lady.
The annual horse show in New York is expected
to be eclipsed by the forthcoming automobile show,
xt which it is said there will be exhibited an auto
capable of making seventy miles an hour on a smooth
road.
It is announced that Crokcr is to retire from New
Yor!c politic;:, but it would have been more accurate
to say New York politics has shaken him off.
THE FOOTBALL SEASON.
THE annual football season is upon us. The
various college and university teams have been
in practice since the weather became cool
enough for hot work, and the "rooters" have invented
their various yells, nicely adjusted to their double
purpose of terrifying the other team and encourag
ing their own. The list of casualties in the practice
games is a measure of the strength and courage that
have been developed, and, until the last game
played, horse-racing and prize-fighting will "go way
back and sit down," according to the latest slang,
while this strenuous sport holds the front of* the
stage.
There is no denying the danger of football; the
bruised bodies and broken bones and the annual
fatalities testify to that. But still it stands first in col
lege athletics. Parents may tremble when their stu
dent sons join the team, but as a rule their commands
are in vain. The boy will play and make his muscle
mighty and his eye quick to excel in the rugged
sport. Professors do not always look kindly on the
game. They make rigid rules as to the scholastic
rating of the players. They scold, .admonish and
deprecate. They warn, advise and forbid. Then when
the game comes oft they are found among the
boys on the bleachers, wearing the team colors and
cracking their throats with the demoniac yell. It is
somewhat the same with the parents of the players.
They go in fear and trembling to see the game and
remain to swing their arms and add their voices to
the awful chorus of encouragement, which makes the
field sound like two rival pandemoniums turned loose
in a match at shouting jargon.
When the game and the motive that makes it popu
lar are analyzed it is evident that it is a favorite with
American boys because it has the spice of danger and
is a rugged test of physical strength, alertness and
courage. It is all very well for the staid old man who
is called "daddy" by two or three student sons to
suggest the bucksaw and tough wood as furnishing
the means of exercise when he was a boy. The buck
saw is all right, but running it lacks the spice of ad
venture and competition that gives football its flavor.
Then the use of a bucksaw is very monotonous, and
youth abhors monotony. If it could be invested with
the variety of changer, that add to the charms of
a strenuous game of football, and with <=nme of the
dangers thereof, it might figure as a rival. But as ft
cannot we fear that "daddy" will have to give it up,
and hang up the buck and the saw, like the fiddle and
the bow of "poor old Ned," and take his place on the
bleachers and master the barbaric syllables of the
yell.
To-day our two universities have it out in the an
nual competition game, and the boys of both will be
there, learning something more than the wild and
dangerous scuffle of the play. They .yvill be learning
to keep their temper and their wits, to take care of
their defense in emergency. The winners will learn
to be polite and not patronizing to the losers, and the
losers will learn the most needful lesson of all â to be
good losers, for in all human history no fact stands
out more prominently in war, politics, business and"
society than that the good loser is the final winger.
If we differ from the parents and the professors
about football in colleges we do so with becoming
diffidence, but still we must insist that the rough and
dangerous game teaches something that is not taught
in books nor classroom. . It is for that reason that
young and old, women and girls, men of affairs and
all, will be found on the bleachers to-day to shout ap
proval at the gladiators who will grapple in the field.
Some may get hurt, but, like the game of war and of
life, the battle will go on to a finish, and may the
best men. win.
In his race for Governor of Massachusetts Josiah
Quincy did about as well as could have been expected
by such of his friends as are reasonable, but he will
not be looked to any longer as a Democratic Moses.
PROGRESS IN THE SOUTH.
ONE of the most cheering factors in the South
ern problem is the rapidity with which it is
developing along all lines of industry. It
may naturally be expected that with an increase of
wealth there will come an increase of education, as
well as more industrious habits, and that from those
improvements there will in turn develop a sense of re
sponsibility to law which will put an end to the
homicides and the lynchings which now not only
disgrace the community where they occur but retard
the immigration of settlers, who would materially
benefit the South in many ways.
Of the industrial advance there is no longer any
question. It is, in fact, one of the most notable fea
tures of the development of our time. It hardly
seems credible that in some kinds of production other
than that of agriculture the South now produces as
much as the whole Union did in 1880, and yet the
trade statistics show that such is the case. In fact, the
South is rapidly advancing from an agricultural to a
manufacturing community. Her cities arc increasing
in population and her railroad mileage is advancing
by le^ips and bounds. In a comparatively few years
the South will no longer be poor. She will be able
to educate her children as well as those of other parts
of the Union and to enforce her laws with an equal
firmness and impartiality.
Some evidences of Southern progress have been
recently presented in the New York Commercial Ad
vertiser, and while they by no means cover the
whole subject they are none the less sufficient to show
that a new era has begun for that section of the
country. In 1890 the South had $61,000,000 invested
in cotton factories, but at present such investments
represent upward of $200,000,000. At present the
Southern mills consume annually about 1,600,000
bales of cotton, while the mills of all other parts of
the country consume 1,800,000 bales. Moreover, the
cottonseed oil industry has developed in the South
until it now yields a product of $80,000,000 a year.
â¢This product a few years ago was thrown away as
waste.
Cotton, however, does not engage all the manufac
turing energies of the South. The advance in tha
iron and coal interests has been not less marked than
that made in the manufacture of cotton goods. At
the present time the South is making about 3,000,
00 tons of pigiron and mining about 50,000,000 tons
of bituminous coal, making an output in each case
which is said to be just about equal to that of the en
tire Union in 1880. Another expanding industry is
that of working up the woods of the country. In
some localities the development of furniture and
other wood-working factories has proceeded so far
they are beginning to be counted as rivals to the lar
gest centers of such industries in the North.
It is to be noted, finally, that the improved methods
of operating gold mines has led to a renewal of gold
mining in North Carolina and Georgia, and fairly
good results have been attained. Thus, in all kinds of
mining, metal-working and wood-working, as well as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1901.
in cotton-spinning, the South is approaching the ac
tivity of the North and the West. It is stated that her
railways are so crowded with business it is almost im
possible for them to handle it.
Surely, with so much in the way of improving ma
chinery, it is not too much to expect there will be
an improvement in the social conditions of the peo
ple, that Bourbonism will die out, and that the South
ern problem, which Is now so perplexing, will solve
itself in the hum of industry, the advance of education
and the establishment of law.
If the report be true that France, Russia and Great
Britain have agreed upon a programme of action with
respect to Turkey, it is likely the Sultan will find a
warm sympathizer in Kaiser Wilhelm.
THE PERPLEXING SURPLUS.
Â£-> ECRETARY GAGE has complained that the in-
creasing surplus in the treasury takes and keeps
money out of the channels of trade. He is not
the only one to whom the surplus is a matter of se
rious consideration. In fact, there are a very large
number of people who have the money on their
minds by day and possibly in their dreams by night,
and one of the things which will interest us in the
proceedings of Congress this winter will be that of
determining what to say about the surplus and what
to do with it.
At the close of October the surplus for the fiscal
year, which began on July r, had already reached the
sum of more than $23,000,000, and it is increasing
right along. The changes made in the war revenue
act at the last session of Congress were expected to
reduce the revenue by $40,000,000, but such has been
the increased prosperity and business of the country
that the reduction will not amount to niore than
$27,000,000. So we have the surplus and the problem
of deciding- what to do with it.
There are three classes of people who have their
eyes on it. First are the liquor men, who believe the
surplus justifies them in demanding a reduction of the
tax upon liquor from $1 10 to 70 cents per gallon. It
is stated that they have already begun their campaign
and will make a strong attack upon Congressmen as
soon as the session begins. They will not have to
fight the battle alone, for the brewers are organizing
and it is probable the two will combine to bring
about a reduction of taxes upon both whisky and
beer.
A second class of men who are interested in the
money are the Congressmen who wish appropria
tions for their districts. It is stated that a river and
harbor bill carrying at least $20,000,000 of immediate
appropriations is one of the things that are confi
dently expected at Washington. Furthermore, there
is a prospect of a good and liberal appropriation bill
for public buildings and the construction of the
memorial bridge across the Potomac. These bills
will of course find favor with many persons, and they
constitute a very strong force in opposition to the
liquor men and the brewery.
Finally, there is among the departments of the
Government itself a desÂ»reÂ«to relieve the treasury of
its surplus and Secretary Gage of his troubles. For
example, the War Department is said to be of the
opinion that the expenditures in the Philippines next
year will be higher than they were for last year, and
consequently more money will be needed. Other de
partments take similar views of their expenditures.
In short, nearly every one who has' a reach long
enough to get at the surplus has a, decided opinion as
to what should be done with it. ' It is a familiar say
ing that it is easier to handle a surplus than a deficit,
but it must be admitted that ir*would take a pretty
big deficit to make mere trouble and cause more talk
than will be produced by this surplus when Congress
gets down to business.
When the chiefs who made the campaign against
Croker, begin to discuss who did the lion's share of
the work we may expect Mark Twain to rise and
claim the honor of having run him out of town by
"way of a new joke.
MINISTER CONGER has transmitted to the
State Department at Washington a transla
tion of a series of rules and orders adopted
by the newly organized Board of National Adminis
tration in China. There have been many reports
that the new board would set about undertaking re
forms which would strengthen as well as improve
China, and from the documents furnished by Mr.
Conger it would seem the reports have by no means
exaggerated the purposes of the officials now at the
head of the Chinese Government.
The full text of the rules and orders transmitted by
the Minister has not been given out by the State
Department, but from the summary that has been
made public it will be easy to perceive that a new and
deeply significant spirit has been awakened in China.
Among other things the regulations say: "Japan is
of the same continent with ourselves; her change of
methods is quite recent, and she has attained to
strength and prosperity. Her experience has been so
nearly like our own that we may derive instruction
from it. The Chinese Minister to Japan, therefore,
should be directed to make a report of all the changes
in Government methods that have been adopted, and
that have proved advantageous, and send it to us; and
all the Chinese Ministers to the various countries
should be instructed to report the various financial
measures, military laws, commercial and industrial
legislation which prevail abroad, selecting the most
important measures, classifying them, and submitting
them to us for our consideration. The object of the es
tablishment of this Board of Administration is to pro
mote the independence of China. China's weakness
is due to her poverty. The strength of foreign powers
is due to their wealth. Heretofore there have been
debts to the foreign powers unpaid; now there is the
pressure of the indemnity, amounting to more than
$14,840,000 per annum."
It may be that the Chinese will not be able to live
up to the spirit of that report, that Chinese conserva
tism and stagnation will be too powerful for any ad
ministrative board to overcome, no matter how en
lightened and enterprising it may be. Nevertheless,
the very fact that the Chinese Government has been
enlightened is a proof that the whole population may
be moved to some extent by the same spirit. It is to
be remembered that the Chinaman 13 by no means so
stagnant and stolid a man as he has been depicted.
The Chinese who come to California do indeed re
tain their old style of dress and many of their ancient
ways and customs, but they manage just the same to
learn American trades and American methods of
doing business. It is therefore no* unlikely that the
race, remembering the suffering and wrongs inflicted
by foreign Invaders, will set itself resolutely to sup
port the improvements undertaken by the Board of
National Administration. If that should happen the
world will have a new problem on its hands before
the century closes.
AWAKENING OP CHINA.
WHEN KING EDWARD
OF BRITAIN SMILES
SNAPSHOT OF EDWARD OF ENGLAND, WHO IS OF UNUSUAL. SE
RIOUSNESS, TAKEN RECENTLY AS HIS MAJESTY WAS GREETING
HIS FAVORITE NIECE. THE CZARINA, IN DENMARK.
KING EDWARD has not forgotten how to smile, says the New York W r orld.
Since his accession to office the new King has shown himself a person
of unusual seriousness. The royal face, formerly of a decidedly genial
cast, has grown many years graver and older. Nevertheless his Majesty
Is still able to smile, and if you study this interesting new photograph
of him you will know how imperial maj? sty looks when it is greeting its favorite
niece.
At the moment when this snapshot was taken the King was saluting the*
Czarina of Russia. They happened both to be in Denmark, where the King had
gone for the first time since his accession to meet the Queen, and where the Czar
and Czarina were at the same time paying a hurried visit to relatives.
The Czarina Is a great pet with all the many branches of her large family.
She is perhaps the most beautiful sovereign in Europe and is the daughter of
that much beloved Princess Alice, the King's sister. And she was always a spe
cial favorite of Queen Victoria. There were a great many reasons why the King
should have been glad to see her, and he undoubtedly was.
NATIONAL THEATER
TO BE ESTABLISHED
IN WINDY CITY
The first national theater may be estab
lished in Chicago, after all. .An experi
ment looking to that end is to be made
there next spring and out of it is hoped to
grow the national theatrical company and
in time a national theater, too. But the
organization is deemed more important
than the building for housing it, and to
getting the company together the first
efforts of the organizers will be devoted.
The movement has been started by
Henry T. Powers, who will place Pow- j
ers' Theater at the disposal of the com-*
pany be organized for a period of three
months. Should the experiment prove ac
ceptable to the public he says he is will
ing after that to turn the theater over
to the organization for a stated time each
year. It is not proposed to seek Govern
ment or municipal help, but to raise a
fund of $50,000 by private subscription for
the other expenses.
The plan was suggested to Manager
Powers by Leo Dltrlchsteln some time
ago, and he Is, therefore, really its orig
inator. It Is proposed to organise a stock
company of twenty-eight persons to pre
sent the pieces chosen. This will be large
enough to permit the leading players to
appear only three times a week, while the
minor players appear nightly.
Four plays would be tried, and after
they had been on#rlew it could be seen
which was the most popular. Two rounds
of performances, it is considered, would i
show the direction of the public fancy j
conclusively enough. Afterward the piece
or two pieces showing the greatest draw
ing capacity would have the preference in
the succeeding two weeks, the others be
ing played, however, at least once every
week. At the end of a month a fifth play
could be produced or revived.
The promoters of the plan hope to ex
tend its operations to New York. Boston
and Philadelphia. The company, it is sug
gested, could play three months each in
Chicago and New York, if a New York
theater could be secured, and divide the
remaining three months between Boston
and Philadelphia.
"Into cities much smaller than these,"
said Mr. Dltrichstein in an interview, "the
company could not hope to go, but Its in
fluence nevertheless would be felt In every
city, and its repertoire of plays could be
drawn upon, after an Interval, by any
crty. More pieces could be put in with the
knowledge that they could not be played
two consecutive nights at a time with
profit, and a blow would be dealt at the
long run system. Long runs have been
the greatest enemy dramatic art has ever
had, and nothing but a repertoire theater
or a repertoire company can bring about
any change in present theatrical meth
ods."

NO MAN'S LAND.
"No Man's Land," over which there has
been a six years' contest between the cor
poration of the city of New York, the
town of Pelham and the county of West
chester, will soon be a thing of the past,
as a bill passed by the recent Legislature
provides for a settlement of this long and
expensive legal dispute.
Ever since the laying out of the city
line in the borough of the Bronx in 1894
there has existed a narrow strip of land
running from the Bronx River in a south
erly direction to the shores of Long Island
Sound, claimed by the city, town and
county, and which has become known
throughout the borough as "No Man's
Land.'' On the Long Island Bound shore
the strip of land In question is about 250
feet wide, and ie tapers gradually for a
distance of two miles or more northerly
until it reaches an angle and dies away
near the heart of South Mount Vernon.
The bill gives the land to the county of
Westchester, but provides tor the con
struction of an avenue 100 feet wide run
ning from Long Island Sound to South
Mount Vernon. The center line of this
avenue will, according to the provisions of
the bill, be the boundary line between
New York and Westchester County, and
the expense of the construction of the
avenue will be borne equally. This new
avenue will also form the eastern boun
dary of Bronx and Pelham parks. Prop
erty owners in the vicinity are elated over
the outcome of the dispute, as it will open
up a territory that has been unimproved
for years and provide a fine roadway lead
ing straight from Long Island Sound.

TELLS STRANGE
STORY OF THEFT
Man Giving the Name of
Harrington Says He
Was Robbed.
A peculiar story of an alleged holdup
on thelngleside road_was reported yes
terday evening lo the'police at'the'Sev
enteenth-street station. A man giving the
name of Harrington and his residence at
2S* Hyde street reported to the ofSce that
he had been held up on the Ingleside road
during the afternoon and relieved of $400
in money and diamonds and other jewelry
valued at $1500.
"When the report was made, detectives
were detailed on the case, and later they
arrested a suspect, whose name was
placed on the detinue book.
A Mr. Harrington does live at 299 Hyde
street, but both he and his wife deny that
he was held up. Mrs. Harrington said
her husband was not possessed of so
much money and jewelry.
The Harrington who lives at 299 Hyde
street Is employed as a cook in a restau
rant at 113 Ellis street. He denied em
phatically that he had been held up or
that he ever had that amount of money
and valuables about him. According to
his story he quit work yesterday morn
ing about 3:30 o'clock, went directly home
and remained there until about 4:30 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. He claimed to have
gene to work at the restaurant about fif
teen minutes later. The men in the res
taurant substantiate that part of his story
and say that he had not left there during
the afternoon and evening-.
Harrington claims that he has never
been near the Ingleside road or the Seven
teenth street police station, and *hat he
knows nothing of any such occurrence.
The description of the "Harrington" that
made the report to the police does not
fit that of the Harrington employed in
the restaurant.
Another story of the robbery is that
"Harrington" was riding on the Ingleside
road in a buggy accompanied by a woman.
A man. wearing a mask, stepped out into
the road, caught the horse by the bridle,
.and asked for a match. At the same
time he drew & pistol, demanded the
money of the man and the jewelry of the
woman. The former passed out $400 and
the woman gems valued at $1500. The
police are still working on the case.
The Biggest on Earth.
Here are various salient facts which
show the magnitude of the Newport
News shipyard:
Largest shipyard on the hemisphere.

Nearly 7000 hands at work.

than any other firm in the United
States.
Biggest drydock in the world, lifting
capacity 1500 tons, operated by electricity
by one man.
Greatest collection of electrio compresd
ed air power machinery in existence.
Biggest vertical planer ever made.

WHERE SCHMITZ
MAY BE FOILED
Mrs. Kincaid Has Friends
Who Will Sustain
Her Position.
Influence of the Election
on the Next State
Campaign.
Mayor-elect Eugene E. Echmitz has
gone to the country for rest and quiet
perusal of the new charter. Before leav
ing the city he spoke of the management
of school depaitment affairs and clearly
gave the impression that Mrs. Kincaid |
would not be rsappointed to the Board of
Education and that her successor would
be a man. This statement is taken to J
mean that the Mayor-elect is in favor of
excluding women from direct manage
ment of school affairs. It is known that
Mayor Phelan was guided somewhat by
the judgment of Mrs. Hearst in appoint
ing Mrs. Kincaid. Mrs. Hearst is helpful
to the State University. She is in favor
of establishing close educational relations
between the State Institution of learning
and the advanced schools of San Francis
co. It is said that she will contend
against the Schmitz proposition to ex
clude women from the local Board of '
Education. Her opposition is likely to be i
sustained by strong influences. After
rest and meditation in the country the
Mayor-elect may reconsider his intention
to banish Mrs. Kincaid from the Board
of Education.
There is a good deal of gossip concern
ing the Chief of Police under the Schmitz
regime. The Call can mention throe men.
neither one of whom will b^; Chief. These
three are Michael Casey, ex-Chief
Isaiah Lees and Lieutenant Esola. It is
a sure thing also that Mose Gunst will
not be appointed Police Commissioner and
that the smokers on the force will not
be compelled to smoke Gunst's cigars.
Recognition of Primary League.
It is refreshing to observe that the Pri
mary League has been recognized by one
of the State boards since iast Tuesday s
election. William Harrington, who led
the Independent Republican forces against
the Martin Kelly push in the Twenty
eighth Assembly District at the primary
election August 13, has been appointed
i wharfinger to fill the vacancy caused oy
! the death of ex-Assemblyman Raw. har-
I rington is a good worker in politics and
! a capable, square man.
The public observes with pleasure the
I interchange of complimentary letters be
1 tween the defeated candidates and the
| winning aspirant for Mayor. The felic
i ity of expression is admirable. The com
i pfiments of the season ought to be broad
; ened or extended to embrace congratula
i tory letters from Colonel George Stone,
I chairman of the Republican State Com-
I mittee, to Hon. A. Ruef, letters from
I Judge McKinley of Los Angeles, John
Mackenzie of San Jose, and A. B. Lem
mon of Santa Rosa to Mr. Ruef would
; not be amiss. Judge McKinley, the
i statesman with the handiest type-writing
machine ever produced for political work,
: should lead off in congratulations to Mr.
i Ruef.
Political Atmosphere Is Cleared.
The result of last Tuesday's election in
I San Francisco is bound to have an im
: portant bearing throughout the State.
: Assurance is given that the Republican
; State Convention next year will not be
forced to accept such a programme as the
! allied corporations represented by W. F.
' Horrin may hand to the delegates. Law
1 vers other than \V. C. Van Fleet of San
Francisco and Judge Sweeney of Shasta
. may reasonably aspire for Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court. The field is
: also wide open for every aspirant for the
office of Governor. Senator Thomas
I Flint, George C. Pardee, E. F. Preston,
N. P. Chipman. E. B. Edson, Frank
Short, Eugene E. Schmitz and Henry T.
Gage and others are privileged to regis
; ter for the race on equal footing.
Senators and Representatives belonging
' to the California Congressional delegation
; wisely refrained from interference in the
recent local contest. Senator Perkins,
who admires oratory, although- not an
: orator himself, was deeply touched by the
eloquence of Samuel M. Shortridge in the
campaign. Mr. Shortridge's tribute to th^
, heroism of the colored troops at San Juan
Hill was truly eloquent. Perhaps it was
a failure as "applied to the mere local
purpose of enlisting the enthusiasm of
the Forty-third Assembly District Afro-
American League for Mr. Wells' candi
dacy, but the ' eloquence was there and
Senator Perkins appreciated it. Election
returns indicate that the colored troops
cf San Francisco, to whom the Shortridpe
: oratory was addressed, followed the lea<l
: ership of Ruef and voted for Schmitz.
Good Work Appreciated.
J. S. Parry, chairman of the executive
committee of the Union Labor "party, has
received the followin-g appreciative letter
from Mayor-elect Schmitz:
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 7, 1901.
j Mr. J. S. Parry. Chairman of Executive Com
; mittee of the Union Labor PartyâDear Sir: I
viHh, through you, to thank the Union Labor
j party, its executive committee, the delegates to
I its convention and the rank and file of its vot-
I ers for the trreat assistance and uniform con
! sideration extended to me by them on every
I hand during the exciting and important cam
! paign which has just closed in victory for us.
: Yv> have won a great fight for the wage-earn
i ers of Ran Francisco for fair recognition and
equal rights, and I trust that through my ad
: ministration, based on high and honest princi
ple?, the relations between employer and em-
I ploye will become less strained, and that the
reciprocal rights of invested capital and organ
; ized labor will be so adjusted, through mutual
1 respect and confidence, that the prosperity and
I well being of the wageworkers of San Fran
: cisco and of every other element of our popula
| tion will be constantly assured. I renew my
I promise that I shall consistently work to that
I en^l, and I trust that when my term of office
j shall expire th* wage-earners of San Francisco
! will point with pride to the record of my ad
| ministration, written not only on the official
I books of the municipality, but also in the hap
piness, contentment and prosperity of my fellow
wageworkPrs. I hope to be able to bring about
such conditions by the conservative and safe
, administration of the city's highest office that
\ the working classes will be looked upon with
i favor and respect by all our fellow citizens,
\ and that they may show that such sentiments,
I of confidence and esteem are justified by their
action r.r.d by mine.
I pledge myself now to do all in my power
to improve the conditions ot* the workingmen
I of our city, within every reasonable limit con
i sonant with the proper protection of the rights
'; of others, and I shall be glad at all times to
; receive in such matters your advice and th.;
i counsel of our fellow-workers in the ranks of
: the party.
My election to the important and dtstin
: guished office of Mayer of this great city, an
j honor cherished above all ocner possibilities
1 Yip.f in no wise turned my head, nor will it
; ever make me forget the cause of those whose
j avowed champion and standard bearer I was
] in this campaign. My office will be open and
1 myself accessible to tham and to all of them
: at all times, to the humblest as well as to the
highest, and I shall be plad to receive you and
thf-m at oil times.
While from my position I bore a great part
of tho hrunt of the battle, I recognize now and
shall always remember, that I alone did not
accomplish tho successful result. A large part
of the work was en the shoulders of my
friends, the woikingmen, and a large part of
the victory is due to their loyal and enthusi
astic support. While I shall never allow this
Ito fade from my recollection, it will in the
I nature of things, be impossible for me' to meet
end thank in person the many thousands of
them who voted for me.
I therefore take this method of thanking
them through you, and trust that you will
give my letter such publicity as you may deem
it worth. Very cordially,
EUGENE E. SCHMITZ
Mayor-elect of San Francisco.

of the Naval Reserves were out last night
with a band celebrating the election of
First Lieutenant T. B. W. Leland, U. S.

was probably the most popular candidate
on any ticket. His fellow sailormen un

terday in financial circles in this city.
The story of the colossal transaction,
as published in The Call, was read far
and wide and on all sides congratulations
were heard for the men who engineered
the big deal.
The acquisition of the Market street sys
tem by the Baltimore syndicate means
more to the residents of San Francisco
than appears on the surface. Not only
will this city have a model street car sys
tem, but the benefits are unlimited that
will result from the present stockholders
receiving the sum of *26,000,000 for rein
vestment. With few exceptions, all the
stockholders of the Market street com
pany reside in San Francisco. They are
to receive cash for their holdings and, as
a natural consequence, the many millions
of dollars must be invested in this city
and vicinity. The money will net be al
lowed to he idle and certainly will not
be taken to the East or other points for
investment, when so many golden oppor
tunities are but awaiting capital in this
city and State.
Arother great benefit that arises from
the transfer of the street car system to
the Baltimore syndicate is the valuable
advertising San Francisco will receive in
all the financial centers of the East and
Europe.
The field of investment in transportation
lines of the Eastern and Middle West cit
ies has been thoroughly utilized and East
ern capital will regard with interest the
colossal transaction of the Baltimore syn
dicate in San Francisco.
George R. Webb, who has represented
the firm of Alexander Brown & Sons of
Baltimore, which, with its many branches,
forms the syndicate, left for the East
yesterday morning. Two hours previous
to his departure Webb met H. E. Hunt
ington, 1. W. Hellman, R. G. Hanford
and Attorney General Tirey L. Ford. The
final papers of the transfer of the Mar
ket-street company's property were signed
and all were elated at the ending of the
huge deal.
Hanford's Power Is Recognized.
The acquisition of the Market street sys
tem is but a step in the plans of the Balti
more syndicate, and in R. G. Hanford the
world of finance is likely to see the rise
of another Napoleon. Hanford first car
ried through the deal by which the San
Mateo line was purchased by the Balti
more, syndicate; then, in the face of great
difficulties, he engineered the purchase by
the syndicate of the Sutter street line and
the Sutro road to the Cliff House. He
has successfully put through the transfer
of the Market street system and other
enormous financial transactions are being
carried on in similar lines.
As soon as the Baltimore syndicate is in
actual control of the Market street sys
tem it will inaugurate many reforms. It
cannot be too strongly emphasized that
the syndicate, in coming to San Fran
cisco, does so for business purposes only
and will have nothing to do with politics.
It will carefully look into the merits of
the local men who will be available for
executive positions and who know the
wants and desires of the people of this
city. Local men will alone be chosen, and

ANTI-POLYGAMY
CRUSADER TALKS
Mrs. Dr. Elliott of Utah
Speaks of the Wives
of Mormons.
Mrs. Dr. Elliott of Utah delivered a lec
ture last evening in the auditorium of th?
Young Men's Christian Association in be-<
half of the anti-polygamy crusade. Dr.
Elliott has spent a lifetime of active ser
vice among the Mormons. She has vis
ited them as a friend and as a physiciar>.
She is probably one of the best informed
authorities on polygamy in the United
States. She has made the cause of the
women of Utah her own, and declares he.
intention of staying wiih the conflict un
til anti-polygamy is made one of the con
ditions of the constitution of the United
States.
tihe presented the religion of Brlgham
Young in a new light. When Roberts
was making nis fight against removal
from Congress he posed as a martyr. He
appealed to the men of America as to the
injustice of udklng him to discard tho
superfluous wives whom he had prom
ised to support and cherish.
"This sounds very grand," continued
the speaker, "but some of- its torce is
taken away when one knows that- every
one of Mr. Roberts' wives possessed in
dependent means, and that between them
they were able to support him very hand
" l"r. Elliott said that it is the almost in
variable custom for the plural wives of a
Mormon to support themselves. They
take up quarter-sections ot land. In this
way the man with four wives is able to
get hold of some SOO acres of landâ plenty
in that fertile State to support wives and
children without any considerable effort
on his part. i
The speaker called attention to the fact
that in this way the Mormons were ac
quiring a vast expanse of territory in a
number of States, and for this reason
alone, she thoaght, some action by the
Government was necessary.
Her interest in the fight, she said, was
the improvement of the condition of tho
Mormon women.
"When a system of ethics produces an
abnormal American woman it Is time for
American womfin to protest."
Dr Elliott then made an earnest appeal
for signatures to a petition to be present
ed by the American women to Congress
asking for the enactment of a constitu
tional amendment of an anti-polygamy
nature. Â , ,
Signature blanks were provided last
night and after the address nearly every
one present signed the petition.
Vaccination and Juxtaposition.
"On my right arm, please," said the
sweet young thing.
The physician who was arranging the
vaccine points looked surprised. The
mother, who was supervising the proceed
ings seemed even more astonished.
"You mean your left arm, Clara?" she
asserted. ,
"No I don't; I mean my right arm, an
swered the willful girl.
"But it will annoy yoy so much less on
your left arm," insisted the mother.
Thegirl blushed, but shook her head.
"You don't understand," she said.
"I confess I don't," admitted the
mother. . . .
"Very likely that is because you were
not vaccinated at a time when you were
ergaged to be married," suggested the
girl "Harold has been vaccinated on his
left arm. so Iâ erâ as a mere matter of
convenience, don't you see, when you con

Herrin, Lynch, Burke et al. to Go.
The heads of the syndicate have always
been opposed to having men in their em
ploy who try to "do politics" or those
who are unpopular with the public. The
notorious political wire-pulling of William
F. Herrin, the flagrant loobying with
lawmakers by Jere riurlie and the high
handed methods pursued in this city for
years by Superintendent of Construction
.Lynch and General Manager E. P. Vin
ing will make them personae non grata
with the new owners of the Market-street
system of transportation. 'i'ne rule of
Cleanliness ,that the syndicate will apply
to its cars and power-houses will also
rule in its selection of employes of all
ranks. They must have clean records and
business ability alone will be considered.
The syndicate admits through its repre
sentatives that San Francisco has en
joyed a good system of street transporta
tion, but it proposes to give its patrons
a model one in every respect.
In the matter of "transfers" the plan in
vogue in the Eastern systems owned by
the syndicate will be used in this city
and the tickets will be given out at all
connecting line 3 of the system.
The acquisition of the San Mateo, the
Sutter street, the Sutro line and the' Ma
rket-street Company's system but mark
the beginning of the operations of the
Baltimore syndicate.
Plan a Network of Lines.
The street car lines in Oakland, Ala
meda, Berkeley and San Jose have been
inspected and options given on these sys
tems. The San Mateo line is to be extend
ed to San Jose and a network of lines Is
pianned around the bay of San Fran
cisco. New lines will run in all directions
and property around the bay will conse
quently increase in value.
The syndicate is not making boasts of
what it intends to do. The sum of $4,000,
00 that will be expended in improvements
on the Market-street system is but a
forerunner of what will be done later on.
The Baltimore syndicate has every
faith in the future of San Francisco and
adjacent territory and the plans of the
Eastern capitalists will in a few short
years make it possible for a trip to be
made on swift street cars starting from
the ferry depot in San Francisco and by
way of San Mateo, San Jose and other
bay shore cities arrive in Oakland, Ala
meda or Berkeley.
The Market-street system, which passes
into the hands of the Baltimore syndi
cate, has more than 200 miles of road.
The company was consolidated on Octo
ber 13, 1593, out of the Market-street Cable
Railway Company, which was opened
July 4, 1860, and incorporated May 20. 1882;
the Central Railroad Company, incor
porated July 3, 1862, and opened in Sep

WANDERING JEW
IS A BAD TYPE
Rabbi Voorsanger Talks
of Modern Fiction
Writers.
In the second of a series of lectures on
the "Wandering Jew" Rabbi Voorsangor
spake last night at Temple Emanu-El on
the character of the Jew as portrayed
in modern fiction. His discourse took tho
form of an analytical review of the works
of Rev. George Croley, General Lew
Wallace and Sienkowitz. He spoke in
part as follows:
In the last decades of the eighteenth century
the legend of the Wandering Jew began to at
tract the attention of writers and poets. Dur
ing the last half of the eighteenth century the
Wandering Jew became a beautiful theme and
the people of Israel became identified with that
lonely wanderer. For over three centuries the
Wandering Jew had been set aside as unworthy
the notice of the latter day historian.
Every prohibitive law, everything that could
be done to set him outside the pale of civiliza
tion, everything that could be conjured up to
exclude him from the sublime and cast him
into the ridiculous mold, was taken advantage
of, until the matter had reached its climax.
Goethe, however, depicted him in his true light
as only could a master word painter.
We therefore find two discordant types of
the Wandering Jew. He is painted by some
writers as the wandering son of the accursed
Cain. In the other he ia a poetic being, gather
ing the ends of the mind of man.
RÂ«v. George Croley and General Lew Wallace
have endeavored to present a consistent Jew
ish character, but in each Instance have sig
nally tailed. Seraphiel is the Rev. Mr. Cio
ley's ideal; Beja-Hur that of General Wallace.
Tt-ftimony shows that the most stubborn re
sistance against Rome was made by n son of
Israel. Neither Hannibal, the Goths, the Van
dals, the Huns, nnr the black visaged warriors
of Africa put up a more stubborn resistance.
Both Croley and Wallace are guilty of creat
ing a scandal that is a disgrace to any Chris
tian writer. Both books are as treacherous to
the Jewish race as is the "Prince of Ind,ia."
All make the Jew appear as an accursed being.
It matters not whtye the Jew Is, or what he is
doing, he is always made out as a traitor to
his taith and his country.
It may be true that everything comes from the
Jew, but all the good that is in him is ob
scured by ecclesiasticis-m. Take all the types of
the Jew as he Is depicted by the story writers.
They first make you see him in all his mag
nificence, only to cast him down and make him
a traitor to his belief and hurl him down to the
most despicable depths.
When you read these books be extremely cau
tious, as there is always some subtle poison
within their leaves. The writers lack the moral
courage to paint the historic character of the
Wandering Jew. These are a few of the dan
gerous tendencies of a. literature that is tainted
with ecclestastieism. The time has come that
when a Christian wants to write a legend of
the Wandering Jew he must change his plan
nd bring the Jew and the Christian together
in unity. But the story must be told as they
travel down the pathway of time together, rer
ognizlng in each other, not what the church
has made them, opposing champions, but rather
champions working to the one end and awaiting
the coming of the Redeemer.
Owing to illness Dr. Jacob Nieto was
unable last night to address the Congre
gation Sherith Israel. He will be unable
to speak to-day, his place being taken by
Rabbi Mannheim.

related in La Chronique of Brussels and

"Johann Steiner, a farmer from the en

he was 55 years of age) a woman of

POLICE CHIEF
SERIOUSLY ILL
He Is Suffering From
Effects of Overwork
and Rheumatism.
Rumors That He Had Suc
cumbed Cause Alarm to
His Friends.
Reports that Chief of Police William
P. Sullivan was in a dying condition were
spread all over the city yesterday even
ing and rumors of his death were aba
circulated.
The reports were exaggerated, how
ever, and while the Chief of Police is a
very sick man the physicians have every
hope of his recovery.
The Chief has been ailing for some
time. He recently suffered from diphthe
ria, and despite the advice of his doctors
and also of his wife insisted on returning
to duty during the recent strike. He wad
on almost constant duty and the strain
gradually wore upon him.
A few days ago he again complained of
feeling sick and was obliged to take
to his bed. Medical aid was at once sum
moned and it was seen that the Chief of
Police was a very sick man. Yesterday
afterncon reports were circulated that
the Chief was suffering from Bright's dis
ease and could not live. This report was
unfourded. Dr. Bazet last evening called
Dr. Galiwey and other physicians into
consultation and it was announced later
that the Chief was suffering from nerv
ous prostration and rheumatism. The
physicians were undecided as to whether
the Chief was suffering from Bright's dis
ease, but inclined to the theory that he
was not afflicted with that malady.
The popularity of Chief Sullivan was
shown yesterday by the numerous ex
pressions of sympathy heard everywhere
in the city when the news of his condi
tion was learned.
The physicians in attendance hope that
with absolute rest Chief Sullivan will re
cover his health.
An Extensive .Traveler.
Have you spent all of your life right
here in this one place?" asked a stranger
of an old fellow he came across seated
on a rail fence whittling in front of a
log and slab cabin tn one of the back
counties of Arkansas.
"Not by a durned sight," was the terse
reply. "I've been hyar the better part o'
the time; but, la, I hey traveled fur an'
wide."
"Ever been abroad?"
"Wai, not exactly to say abroad, on
less you call goln' abroad to . go from
here way over to Petersville. I been
over there twice in the last forty year.
Its thirty-six an' a half mile to Peters
ville, an' I been furder than that, fer my
ole woman an' me went clean to Hog
back Ridge on our weddin' tower, an'
that's forty-one mile from here. Then I
been over in Pettis county to see my
wife's folks twice, an' that's twenty odd
miles from here. Then I been over to
Rocky Hill ez many ez four times, an'
that's eighteen mile. Ez I say, I been
here most o' the time, but then I've trav
eled fur an' wide all the same. I've seen
the big four-story mill over In Peters
ville, an' the engine kyars over to Pea
ville. I rid three miles on 'em. an' It's
all I want o' the pesky things. I've seen
a calf with two heads an' a feller that
could eat fire an' dance on broken glass
in his bare feet. I see a man hung once
an' a hoss race for a purse of $65. Yes,
sir; I've been fur an" wide, an' I reckon
I've seen the biggest part o' what there
is to see In this world, *nd I don't let on
doln' no more gaddin' about." â July Llp

Origin of Four Ones.
There is a tradition that accounts for
the four ones instead of the TV. A
famous French jeweler of the name of
Henry Vick presented to King Charles V,
surnamed Wise, a clock whose dial bore
the correct Roman numerals.
Now, Charles did not know anything,
but being a King, he pretended to omni
science, and after failing to find a flaw in
the works said:
"The clock runs well, but you have got
the figures on the dial wrong."
"Surely not, your Majesty," protested
the jeweler.
"Yes; that four should be four ones."
"You are wrong, your Majesty."
"I'm never wrong!" thundered the King.
"Take it away and correct the mistake."
Vick obeyed. The fashion was followed
by others, and to this day we have 1111

TENNIS PLAYERS
OF OTHER DAYS
ON THE COURTS
Tom Driscoil, Will and Gus
Taylor, Hobart and Others
Promise to Appear Again
The oft-discussed question as to whether
the champion tennis players of former
years were as skillful as those of the
present day will probably be solved short
ly. The Taylors. Will and Gus. Tom Dris
coll, Walter Hobart and other old-time
experts have expressed their intention of
again taking up the game. For several
years Will Taylor was in a class by him
self on the coast. At that time Champion
Whitney was a beginner. Those who are
in a position to know are all inclined to
think the quality of the game has ad
vanced considerably in the last few years.
Taylor can hardly be expected to regain
hU championship form, but it will be pos
sible to judge from his present game how
he would rank with the cracks of to-day.
He would probably be near the top of the
firfct class, but would have his hands full
beating such men as MacGavin, Collier
and Smith.
"Young Joe" Tobin created a sensation
last Sunday by his brilliant volleying.
With Gus Taylor as a partner, he easily
defeated Collier and Crowell with a small
handicap.
If Tobin could bring his back-court
Btrokes up to his volleying he would be
a hard man for any of the experts to
beat. Tom Driscoil. ex-champion of the
coast, is another beautiful net player. He
16 lcit handed and puts lots of steam into
his strokes.
The handicap doubles tournament held
last Sunday was successful in point of
numbers, but the outcome was unsatisfac
tory, as the winnersâ C. Smith and Codeâ
yon the cups by piaying only one match.
They won both the semi-linal and final
match by default.
The tournament committee of the Cali
fornia Tennis Club is planning a novel
tournajnent. This is to hold a tournament
for each of the classes on different days
and an inter-class handicap tournament
for the winners of the classes. The short
ening days and the large entry list make
It impossible to complete a class tourna
ment in one day.
The public courts in Golden Gate Park
are being- placed in better condition and
in a short time will be as good as any
similar courts in the State. The oiled
courts are much harder than they were
at first and will be in first-class order in
a. month or two. The courts are particu
larly fast after a rain. The old band-
Btajid has been removed. In its place is
being erected a fine club house, which
will be fitted with lockers and showers.
It is the intention of the park tennis

BERKELEY. Nov. S.â The I'niver
sky of California football men
have passed all stages of prepa
ration for ths intercollegiate
game to-morrow afternoon, and
are waiting with what patience they have
for the hour to arrive when the first
whistle will sound. Behind them they
have the loyai support of the college*
they representâ of \he men and women
who have watched them grinding ami
struggling day after day on the gridiron,
and have felt their confidence In the
team's ability to win grow with each suc
ceeding day. The season opened in a
half-hearted fashion, with the worth of
the material in doubt. Time and work
have changed this, and California sup
porters look tor victory. They recognize
the struggle will be hard and the game
close, but in Berkeley there is p. strong
ieelmg of coniiaence as to ultimate suc
cess which aoes not come from loyalty
alone.
No man on the team mentions defeat.
The word has fallen into disuse in the
training quarters, yet those who have
watched the work, stcrinct; and care of
coaches and men cannot say that Cali
fornia has a case of "over-confidence."
The team is going in determined to win,
and whichever way the score goes there
will have been some good football played
in San Francisco to-morrow.
The last twj days have been passed
with just work enough to keep the men
in condition. Signal practice, punting
and running in ct punts has been the ex
tent of the exercise. Considerable time
has been spent in the training (fuarters
in order to get all the benefits possible
of the trainers' care. Bruises were looked
after and strained muscles kneaded and
worked, after the strenuous methods of
athletic training, back into shape again.
On the whole the physical condition of
the team is satisfactory. Dibblee's knee
is not expected to last, but the team has
a good man in Starr to take his place.
Dlbblee may not go on the field at all, for
his condition is such that another night's
rest and care must be had to determine
that. Duden's series of unlucky acci
dents puts his ability to stay through the
game in question. He has gained much
during recent rest and is counted on to
make a good showing, whether in the
game five minutes or throughout both
halves. Btow's shoulder is sore, but
should not hinder his play seriously.
There will probably be considerable
shifting of positions during the game. In [
defensive work it Is planned to have Hud- '
son go back of the line and Womble play
end. More will go in the back field,
where he has no superior on the Califoi
nia team. Should Duden be disabled More
will go in at full. Hudson at quarter.
Womble at end and Whipple at right
half. Should More go out Hudson will g i
to quarter. Womble to end and Whipple j
to half. Should both More and Duden go
out Sherman will be called into action
back of the line. These shifts are made
necessary through scarcity of substitute
material.
Records of the Men.
The men whÂ« will play for California
and their previous records ar% as follows:
Captain I>. A. Womble will represent Cali
fornia on the gridiron for the fourth and last
time against Stanford. He played at end dur
ing his freshman year and held that position
for the two succeeding seasons. His past work
has gained him the reputation of an alert,
6wift player, strong at breaking up an oppos
ing play and clever in blocking on the line.
Before entering college he played end and cap
tained the eleven from St. Matthew's School.
Womble will go on the field at rierht half
on the offensive, but on the defensive he will
play end. He runs well with the ball, but
when the opposing team hap the pigskin he
is needed on the line for his ability to stop
end runs.

Genilottt. center. playÂ«d sub-center- on the
Olympic heavyweights and center on the light
weights helore coming to college. He was sub
center here last year. Gendotti is light for
the position, weighing but IG4 pounds.
Orval Overt.ll, right guard, is the heaviest
man on the team as well as one of Its most
reliable players. This is his second year on
the varsity, he having made the team during
his freshman days of twelve months ago.
Previous to that he played for three years as
fullback on the Visalia High School team.
Overall has developed into a first-class player.
He is cool and reliable and his giant bulk is
formidable in defensive and offensive plays.
He is often put back to run with the ball and
seldom fallp to gain distance for his team.
In punting he is unexcelled on this gridiron
or perhaps any other on this coast.
S. M. Stow, left gruard, had three years' ex
perience as tackle on the Belmont team before
coming to college. He was substitute en last
year's varsity, but was put in the game soon
after the first half began on account of Clay
being ruled off the field.
J. O. Heaaea, right tackle, is playing on the
varsity for the first time. He made freshman
tackle in 1898, after having some experience
at full on the Arcata High fchool team. He
has been faithful to his university by giving
his time for the past two years to second
eleven work.
W. B. Albertson plays a reliable game at
left tackle. He commenced his football career
on the Belmont team, played tackle on the
freshman eleven in '98 and substituted on the
varsity in his sonhomore year. This is his
second season on the first eleven at tackle.
Harry Hudson is playing at right end after
a past season's varsity experience on the other
side of the line. Before entering college he
played end and quarter on the Marysville High
School team and end at St. Matthew's.
Claude Starr Is playine left end after two
years' experience in the same position at St.
Paul's School, Garden City. Long Island, and
one year at California. He was caotain of
the freshman eleven last year.
Wilson IMbblee will go in at left and some
time during the game, but a wrenched knee
is not expected to let him stay in long. Dib
blee is a eood end and a thorough workeV.
He has had three years at end at Belmont
and was sub-end on last year's varsity.
Johnny More will play quarterback. He has
had a year's experience on the first eleven
in the same position, played two years at half
at Belmont. was fullback on the freshman
team in 1898 and svb-full on the varsity in
'99. More is a splendid back fielder and passes
the ball well at quarter. He is fearless and
swift, but lack of weight makes hi 3 defensive
play weak.
E. Mini plays a capable game at left half.
His work at running ends and diving through
the line is splendid. He played one year on
the Vallejo High School team and was half
in his freshman year at college. Last season
he was snb-half on the varsity.
Ernest Duden is playing his second year as
fullbaclt. His early experience was on the
San Francisco Young Men's Christian Associa
tion eleven and as center on the freshman team
and a few "cans" at their shooting lodge
near Sears Point.
Edgar Forster and Ben Baum each se
cured f-ome twenty-three birds also on
San Pablo Bay.
The marshes near Belmont were alive
with sportsmen last Sunday in quest of
rail. The season closes on the 15th inst..
so that all who can are taking advantage
of the last opportunities offered.
The market hunters apparently do not
keep informed on the laws governing the
killing of game in this State. Every day
the deputies of the Fish and Game ' Co
mission seize quail sent into the market
to be sold. I'nder the new law no quail
can be exposed for sale.
Chaffer Admits He Got Drunk.
The Chaffer divorce suit yesterday end
ed in a decree of divorce and the custody
of two minor children being given to Mrs.
Chaffer. Suit was brought for divorce on
the ground of extreme cruelty. Chaffer,
who testified yesterday, admitted getting
drunk "about three times a month." but
said he seldom got so drunk that he was
not able to navigate. He got drunk, he
said, every time he went hunting.
Mrs. Chaffer testified that her husband
insisted on having his hunting dogs
sleep on her best rugs and that he
would come home at 4 a. m. and- compel
her to get up and cook his breakfast, so
that he could make an early start on a
hunting trip.
Position.
in 189 S. In '99 he tried for a position back
of the line but failed to make the varsity.
â¢ What the Coaches Say.
Head Coach Dr. Frank Simpson looks
for a close game and hopes for victory.
He says: â¢ * . , . â¢
We have endeavored to develop an all 'round
team, which 'Will not have to depend alone on
punting or bucking or end runs, but can use
them all with equal facility. We have Â¦ been
handicapped greatly this season 1 , by lack of
material. I have no complaint to make of
the men who are in the team or who stayed
with the game, but many men have deserted
us, "especially freshmen, and there are a lot
of big men around . college who ought to be
in .suits but who are not. The boys ! who
stayed with practice deserve great credit for
the manly way in which they have conducted
themselves. So far as I know there has been
i'O friction among them and never, a word of
complaint has reached me. They have worked
faithfully and as a result we have a good
team that will play together and put up a
hard, gritty game. If they ape defeated they
deserve the same credit for their honest work
as if they are victorious. With our strong de
fense and ' capable punting we should not
allow a big score to be run up against us.
Our defense ought to hold them. We hope for
victory. -.-.- Â¦ Â¦-...-,.Â¦
L. A. Womble, capta'.n of the eleven,
has this to say regarding to-morrow sÂ»
game: . -'. . -
The long grind of the season ii finished.
The coaches have done their best for the team
in every way and I feel confident that, come
what may. California will be prepared to meet
It. A certain lack of material has been off
set by the spirit and determination shown by
the men. Too much cannot be said in praise
of the small body of. loyal men which has
stood by the team and the coaches and en
abled them to whip into shape the varsity
materialâ l mean the second eleven. The team
Is a. good crowd bf light, gritty fellows who
will stay with the game to the finish and I
sincerely hope that finish will be across the
Stanford goal line. -V,
Assistant Coach James Hopper spoke of
to-morrow's prospects as follows: :

The features of Stanford's game which I
consider most dangerous to California are
Maker s line hammering and Traeger's place
kicking- Neither team has any man approach-
Inp Slaker for relentless, ferocious bucking
Iraeger, with an additional season's practice
has become very dangerous this year. Overall
of taJifornia Is also place kicking, but h- is
of course, one year behind Traeger in th* sub
tle play. The punting will be about even for
distance, but in California's favor for accur
acy. In I would say that Stanford
has gome advantage in offensive work, neu
tralized to a degree by California's stronger
detense.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov.
B.â The cardinal eleven went
through the final signal practice
to-night prior to their effort on
the gridiron to-morrow. The team
will not leave Palo Alto until to-morrow
morning, arriving in San Francisco abouc
1! o'clock, when they will proceed at once
to the Palace Hotel. They will remain
there until time for the final contest.
Coach Fickert says of the outlook:
To-morrow's game will be even harder fought
and the teams more evenly matched than they
were last year. Berkeley's principal chance of
scoring lies in end runs and straight plunges.
However our ends will be stronger than people
Â¦ generally believe.
Trainer Moulton vouches for the condi
; tion of the men in the following state
ment:
The men are all in first-class condition ami
: will go into the game without a bandage â alk
! being in proper shape. No one of them will be
! handicapped by a bruise or sore that amounts
ito anything. The condition of the team i 3
i such that they should put up better bail In
: the second than In the first half. I believe the
men have followed training rules as closely as
possible and I appreciate their faithful train
ing and think it will bring forth good results.
Captain' Fisher te cheerful over the
piospects, but not overconfident. He said
to-day:
We think we are to meet a team just about
equally as good as oursâ the chances are even.
Most of our new plays will be a mixture of
Eastern and Western football and there is
some doubt in my mind as to their effective
ness. We are going to play a good, hard clean
game of football and if we are defeated it
will be because we have met a better team.
A perusal of the descriptions of the
varsity men, aa given below, shows that
the average age of the cardinal varsity
is nearly 22 years, the average height 5
feet 10 inches and the average weight
l-early 174 pounds.

Upon the outcome of the Petaluma

proposed heat stake. Many of the owners
whose coursers are admittedly in a class
below that of the speedy champions in in
closed meetings expect to even up mat

ized they will be anxious to give their
opponents a return at a game whers
stamina is as great a factor as speed.
D. J. Healey has withheld his champion
greyhound Sisquoc from the plains meet

Curtis" stake- winner Beacon. The Peta

should impress Curtis as an easy p

dog and a winner for his owner, in i
match race with Beacon, where speetl
would be the prime factor, the talent fig
ures he could not be trained to get foot
enough to offset the great blue grey
hound.

OARSMEN SEEKING
SAFE ANCHORAGE
FOR THEIR HOMES
March of Improvements in
Mission Bay Deprives Clubs
of Their Former Locations
At the last reguiar monthly meeting of
the Ariel Rowing Club the following nom
inations were made for officers to serve
during the coming year: For president,
Charley Wilson; vice president. A. W.
Tayloâ¢ financial secretary, Eugene Flan
ders; treasurer, Johnson Hardy; captain.
W. McKee and Harry Foley; lieutenant
captain, E. L. Smith; directors, Robert
Ellis, A. W. Taylor, W. T. Howe, Robert
Collins, P. J. Enright, George McGinnis
and Leon Franks; delegates to the Pacific
Association of the Amateur Athletic
Union, E. J. Lynch, A. W. Taylor and
W. Keegan. Among the candidates are
most of the best known oarsmen in the
club. Charles Wilson, Robert Ellis and
W. T. Howe having rowed in the senior
barge crew and Harry Foley and E. L.
Smith being members of the junior barg-j
crew which took first place in the Lake
Uerritt regatta. P. J. Enright is a past
president, and E. J. Lynch is nearing the
end of his term as president.
The representatives of the Ariel Row
ing Club have been assured that a site
for a boat house will shortly be assigned
them by the Harbor Commissioners. The
new plans of the drydock company
leave the location previously selected by
the Ariels open and it is not unlikely that
the club may get it, in which case the
work done on the concrete piers will not
have been wasted. In aid of the building
fund the club is preparing to give a mas
querade ball at Saratoga Hall on Satur
day evening. November 23.
Several members of the Olympic Boat
Club were out last Sunday in outrigged
skiffs on Tiburon lagoon and Belvedere
Cove. It is proposed to hold a regatta in
the cove at an early date, probably Sun
day, November 17. The plans of the
Olympians for securing a tract of land
in East Oakland for an athletic field
seem to have failed, but some other suit
able ground on San Antonio estuary may
be found.
Alameda Cricketers' Averages.
The batting and bowling averaged of
the members of the Alameda Cricket Club
for the season of 1901 have been prepared
by the secretary. They show Bert Bird
at the head of both lists. His batting
average for twelve completed innings in
association matches is 37.1, his best score
in a single inning being 120 runs. In
bowling he took 23 wickets at an average
cost of 6.5 runs. The batting averages of
those who batted not less than four times

Bert Bird and F. J. Croll, who have
learned cricket wholly in California, have
now surpassed their teachers, having
made most runs during the season and
having the two highest innings of the
year to their credit. F. J. Croll has
played in more innings than any other
member of his club and only one other
player, G. H. Ward, equals Bert Birfl's
total number of completed innings. Tile
veteran batsman J. J. Moriarty's average
is a little below that of Croll and much
below that of Bert Bird. He has been ill
and has not been able to do himself jus
tice.
In bowling Bert Bird has the best aver
age, but Harold Ward's performance is
really better, as he took more than twice
as many wickets at a slightly greater
east. The averages of all the bowlers
who captured any wickets in an associa
tion match are given below:

The Board of Public Works received
bids yesterday for the paving with asphalt
of Mission street from Silver avenue to
Onondaga avenue. The Alcatraz Asphalt

at $59,296 60, and will be awarded the con
tract. The cost as estimated was $30,000,
and the Board of Supervisors appropriated
the sum of $15,000 for the purpose, the
balance having been raised by subscrip
tion by Commissioner Maguire from sev
eral hundred taxpayers and property own

men the roadway of Potrero avenue from
Twenty-first to Twenty-third streets was
received from the City Street Impro?*

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1901.
FOOTLIGHTS ATTRACT JOCKEY O'CONNOR,
WHO WILL STAR AT ONE PERFORMANCE
To Appear To-Night in Role of German Comedian â Cousin
Carrie Outsprints Some Fast Ones at Oakland Track.
Jesse Matthews on Sir Hampton Defeats Goldone a Head
WHEN scarcely old enough to
tell the time of day Jockey
Winnie O'Connor schooled
horses at the steeplechase
game. He has scribbled off
verse of the "Great Chicago Fire" and
"He Shouldn't Have Struck Dear Old
Dad So Hard" sort; possesses a fair
voice; can knock out six out of ten of
the itinerant featherweights with four
ounce gloves; put up a finish that re
verses the hair on the cranium of every
body in the grand stand because of its
closeness, and now Winnie has histrionic
aspirations. To-night at the Grand
Opera-house the noted rider will make his
debut as the unlucky German in "The
Man From Mexico." Winnie says he has
n dialect that will dispel all recollections
of Bonnie Runnels and "Dutch" Daly
and as the house has been sold out, he
can rest assured of getting a warm recep
tion.
By the way, things did not break any
too well for O'Connor at Oakland yester
day, Royalty being his only winning
mount. He finished second on Gibraltar
and later on with the leg up on Goldone
was beaten a head by Sir Hampton, ably
piloted by "Jesb" Matthews. Altogether
it was a discouraging day at the track
for favorite players, as three heavily
backed choices were counted out.
At the commencement Buck Taylor, a
smartly bet on 7 to o chance, fell by the
wayside. He met with some Interference
at the start, and Clarando, a 10 to 1 shot, I
wita little Ransom up, won all the way. t
Nilgar finished third behind Tizona.
Undoubtedly short in his previous race, I
Willie Sink's Royalty made a joke of tne
two-year-old sprint. Inocencia, it was
thought, might furnish an argument, but
bhe died away young. The coin was set
on Royalty at 4 to 5 and O'Connor never
had to make a move until the last 100
yards, when St. Sever moved up from the
third hole.
Introduced to some very moderate com
pany in the mile selling affair, Galanthus
finally won a purse. At that, Ransch had
the chestnut in a pocket to the stretch.
There he extricated himself and with the
10 pounds gradually anchoring Tony
Lepping, got home less than a length to
â¢ the good. Game Warden ran into the
show.
Cousin Carrie, the fast daughter of Mid
lothian and Sister Mary, upset calcula
tions a trifle in the six furlong number
following. An 8 to 1 shot In the ring,
she gave the slip to the others at the
start and was never headed, winning all
out by a length.
Gibraltar, the even money favorite,
ridden by O'Connor, had his hands full
to overhaul and down Reina de Cuba a
head for the place.
W. J. Spiers and his friends got a very
fair price about Oscar Tolle in the betting
on the seven-furlong run, for which but
four lined up at the webbing. S^a Lion,
carrying ninety-nine- pounds and ruling
an even money chance, broke away first,
only to be shortly after passed by Oscar
Tolle. Ransom astride the latter let the
big colt rate along, and he registered an
exceedingly clever win in 1:27 flat. The
favorite took the place from Decoy in a
drive. Rio Shannon has apparently gore
back, as he never looked a contender.
A close and exciting drive marked the
finish of the concluding mile and 100 yard
run. When Goldone, the favorite, had
passed Pat Morrissey and looked to have
the race won Jesse Matthews slipped
along on the outside with Sir Hamptoi',
and despite O'Connor's desperate riding
got the decision by a head. The winner
opened favorite but later gave way to
Goldone.

JEFFRIES COMES
TO COMPLETE HIS
TRAINING WORK
Has Established Himself in
Oakland and Will Use the
Reliance Club Gymnasium
James J. Jeffries, champion heavy
weight pugilist of the world, arrived in
Oakland last evening. The big fellow
presented a hearty appearance. His
clothes did not fit his athletic form as of
yore, and the champion apologized for
this, explaining that he has reduced him
self by heavy training at Harbin Springs.
Jeffries' trip from the-health resort was
without accident. Tluft there was none
was due to the care exercised by Billy
Deianey, the big tellow'a trainer. DÂ«
laney had a heart to heart talk with the
stage driver before starting on the eight
en-mile journey through the mountains.
"Billy" at the outset admitted that the
driver was skilled and he knew it, but he
did not want an exhibition of fancy driv
ing for fear of an accident. Deianey or
dered the manipulator of the reins to take
his time and nut go round curves on two
wheels. The driver was impressed with
the importance of his contract and drove
siowly and carefully.
At every stopping place along the route
the citizens came out to see tne big fel
low. They admired his proportions and
debated his chances in* the coming fight.
Many presumed an acquaintanceship with
Jeffries and grasped his mighty right.
Jim stood the ordeal in good fashion.
Throughout the long journey to the city
he skylarked and raised his voice in song.
Deianey was delighted with this display
of spirits, because it presaged that hla
man was not worrying.
Jeffries was accompanied by Bob Arm
strong, JBilly Deianey, Jack Jeffries.
'"Kid" Eagan, George Miller and Colonel
Fulton J. Berry of Fresno. The cham
pion tbok quarters at the Hotel Metro
pole, where he will stay until after the
battle.
Eugene Van Court met the champion
when ho alighted from the train and tha
two old friends cordially greeted eacn
other. Jeffries told V-in Court he never
felt better in his life. He asked the latter
if he had secured any bets yet, and Van
Court informed Mm the betting was light.
Jeffrie3 brought down a handsome pai
of antlers as evidence of his prowess as
a hunter. He presented them to John
Markowitz. Jeffries' baggage was heavy.
He had five trunks tilled with wearing
apparel, gymnasium apparatus and sou
venirs gathered in the last five years.
In the evening the champion went t.i
the Dewey Theater. He retired at 11
o'clock. Jim will be up early this morn
ing and take a jog over the Oakland
streets. He will begin work at the Reli
ance Club at 10:30 a. m., and will also ex
ercise in the afternoon.
It is his intention to box Armstrong and
his brother alternately. He wants them
to work fast, and by giving them four
minutes' rest after each round expects to
get the desired speed. The champion re
ceived several pairs of boxing shoes from
the East last evening.
State Floral Society Meets.
The State Floral Society held its regu
lar monthly meeting yesterday afternoon
in Sherman, Clay & Co.'s Hall, 223 Sutter
street. There was a large attendance and

the society, who is one of its most active
members. The selection of official poet
ess made at the previous meeting was

RUHLIN'S HEART
ACTION SLOWEST
RECENTLY NOTED
Is Absolutely Healthy and
Resembles That of Napo
leon in Number of Its Beats
In addition to being an aspirant for
heavyweight championship honors in the
prize ring Gus Ruhlin claims other dis
tinctiops. He says his pulse is "gaUed"
lower than that of any other healthy
man alive. Ruhlin's natural heart action
is only 42 beats to the minute. In this
he resembles the great Napoleon. Cham
pion Jeffries also has an exceedingly low
pulse. A renowned New York heart spe
cialist has said it helped him both in hia
training and in his battles. Just why a
low pulse is a favorable circumstance in
a fighter's makeup only a physician who
has studied it carefully could say. Jef
iries' heart action i 3 usually about 52
beats to the minute.
Dr. Charles A. Clinton, who made a
physical examination of Jeffries at Har
bin Springs for The Call, visited Blank
en's yesterday. Gus was sitting on the
veranda with his manager, Billy Madden,
and some friends when the physiciari
called. The conversation quickly turned
to Jeffries. Dr. Clinton had spent several
clays with the champion and had much
information about Jeff and his training,
all of which was eagerly listened to by
Gus and his friends. In speaking of Jeff's
wonderful 'physical condition Dr. Clinton
incidentally mentioned that he had thÂ»
lowest pulse he had ever noticed in as
athlete.
Ruhlin invited the doctor to feel his
pulse. Dr. Clinton took the big fellow's
wrist and encircling it with his pulse
teeling finger, noted the beats. When the
physician's watch had clicked off a half
minute his face became a study. First
it was an expression of apprehension and
then one of wonder and perplexity. When
Dr. Clinton had taken the pulse a min
ute he said: "Why that beats anything
I ever saw." Gus asked him how many
beats he had recorded and the physician
told him 46. "Well, that's two more than
usual," said Gus, "it generally only
counts 43."
Dr. Clinton was surprised at the coirii
cidence of the slow heart action of the two
neavyweights. Ruhlin's heart Is normal
and absolutely healthy.
Ruhlin basked in the sunshine until 3
o'clock, when he went to the gymnasium
and worked out strongly. The room pre
sented a busy scene. Ruhlin punched thÂ«
tag in one corner. Lavigne hammered
a leathern sphere in another. Tom Her
man skipped rope and swung dumb bells,
and Denver Ed Martin flitted about thÂ»
100 m. Ruhlin punched the bag for sev
eral three-minute rounds. He also took
his usual inning at the heavy grain sack.
He worked an hour. Ruhlin will prob
jibly omit his afternoon gymnasium work
to-day and substitute a trip on the road
instead.
SUPREME COURT ORDERS
AUDITOR WELLS TO ACT
He Refuses to Allow the Claim of a
Corporation for $1625 Overpaid
in Taxes.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that the Pacific Coast Company should
be paid $1625 from the city treasury.
Through a clerical error the corporation
paid this amount in excess of Its legal
taxes, and upon the recommendation ot
the Assessor the Board of Supervisors
ordered that it bÂ« returned. Auditor
Wells refused to audit the bill and suit
was commenced. The Superior Court up
held the Auditor, but the judgment is now
reversed.
By a decision of the Supreme Court also
the Provident Savings Life Assurance So
ciety of New York is sustained in its re
fusal to pay $2500 to Matilda Nielsen on
an insurance policy. The plaintiff's de
ceased husband was insured in the com
pany, but was delinquent in the payment,
of premiums at the time of his death. The
lower court held that the company waÂ«
liable for the amount of the insurance,
but the Supreme Court rtnds no ground
for such an opinion and orders a new
trial.
Says Mrs. Maxwell Is a Disturber.
An answer to the suit instituted by Mrt).
M. M. Maxwell, a minister of the Inde
pendent Freethought Bible Spiritualistic
Socity, against the society for restoration
to membership was tiled by the director*
of the organization yesterday. In Mrs.
Maxwell's complaint it was alleged that
she was removed without cause and with
out having a chance â¢Â© defend herself.
The directors in theft* answer deny Mrs.
Maxwell's allegations and claim that she
was expelled from the society because Â«he
was not congenial and that her presence
at the meetings cauied discussion and
prevented the members acting 1 in har
mony. They claim further that Mrs. Max
well brought her private disputes into thÂ«
society instead of settling them on the
outside, as the by-laws of the society pro
vided.
Carson Loses His Wife.

RICH DISCOVERIES OF MINERALS IN MANY SECTIONS OF NEVADA LEAD ARMY
OF PROSPECTORS OVER SNOWY SIERRA AND RENEW PROSPERITY OF THE STATE
EDITOR OF THE STATE JOURNAL
PLEASED WITH THE OUTLOOK
NEVADA liaÂ« now a bright prospect. It needs only the foster
ing Influence of capital and enterprise to make it agrain fa
mous for its addition* to the world's store of treasures. At
tliift tinie prospectors are afield in many directions and the
range of their exploitation extends over a vast area. De
posits of great value have recently been discovered and
these are yielding; very rich ores. The mountains of Nevada
have only been scratched, comparatively speaking-. They contain
enormous wealth, the extent of which can only be conjectured.
Reno is attracting; much attention for many cogent reasons.
It is a railroad center with large possibilities. The State Univer
sity, extensive in scope and admirable in its results, holds ont al
lurements that draw to us citizens from all parts of Xevada, Cali
fornia and from other sections, who make their homes here per
manently in the end. Our sheep and cattle men are alive and pro
gressive. Since the "Wedekind discovery prospectors have flocked
here from many camps and they are still coming.
As a place in which to dwell Reno ls perfection. It has a fine
climate, delightful surroundings, broad and well-kept streets,
active business men, an intelligent and growing population,
handsome dwellings and unlimited room ln which to expand. New
buildings of a good class are continually being added. In my
opinion, as a candid observer, this State, and Reno especially, has
a glorious outlook. JOHX H. DENNIS,
Editor Nevada State Journal.
RENO. New, Nov. B.â Sitting by the
beautiful Truckee River, with her
eyes upon the snow crested sum
mits of the Sierra, lovely Reno 's
Â« dreaming of future greatness â of
a boom, in fact. Down from
mountains ribbed and seamed
with precious ores comes the
Truckee 6parkling, flashing, ever
singing; now necked with white
as it is whirled into eddies, now
dropping with sheer weight, as water
falls, in masses of foam. Strong as a
multitude of giants to turn wheels and to
awaken the cadences of falling stamps.
Its hurrying flood also promises fruitful
ness to thousands of arid acres and makes
lands that not long ago produced only
sagebrush blossom as the rose.
On the northern heights of Reno the
JCevada State University, commanding a
view of the eternal mountains that rim
the fortunate Washoe Valley, also sur
veys a remarkably^ pleasing vista of roofs
end 6pires that nestle amid rows of pop
lar and cork elms, whose leafage, touched
by the season and the frost, flames yellow
against the blue background of the far
mountainsâ a flame of pure gold.
Here are the three sources of Reno's
Jiresr-nt prosperity and the basis of her
reasonable dream of developmentâ the
Â¦wealth giving mountains, the wealth giv
ing river and the institution of learning
which draws to thia center men of all
classes, who seek education for their chil
dren. The agriculture and stock and
sheep raising, that are important factors
ln the development of Washoe County,
dÂ«pend upon the Â»aters of the Truckee
and its many trroutary streams. This
trinity of favoring causes have made
Keno thriving and charming, but the
growth of the community has been steady
rather than rapid until within the last
few months.
Wedekind Appears.
Now there appears upon the scene a
little o'd man who is sitting on an over
used buckboard and who treads the
Reno streets daily, driving a sway-backed
and flea bitten old white horse that only
just moves when goaded by a green
6witch from a Lombardy poplar. Day
after day, month after month, year after
year, this little old man has traveled the
same road in the morning and has re
turned the same way every night, the
â¢weather permitting. His clothes are rag
j:e<3. Hie old white hat has long been
overdue in the refuse pile. But stop a
minute and peer under that white hat.
{There you shall see frank, blue. German
fcyes, a little faded, but with the glint of
faur&ee Jo them. The lower part of the
face is made masculine by a strong,
square jaw. So shall you discover the
features of a man of force, of character;
of a man with the Midas touch.
In th<_- year 1831, in the song land of
Germany, in Hesse-Cassel, was born a boy
with a musical ear, George H. A edekino.
He learned to distinguish between deli
cate distinctions of sound with the facil
ity of a skylark. His school days devel
oped a musician. In time he also learned
something of metallurgy and geology. He
served his time In the German army;
then, tiring of it all, turned his back on
his native land and came to the United
States.
He tuned pianos for the Steinways for
a time. Then came the Civil War and
Wedekind, afraid that he would once
more become a compulsory soldier, de
cided to go to San Francisco. He was
known well to musicians, as he worked
over pianos. Then came the White Pine
district mining excitement. Wedekind
went to White Pine, speculated and once
mere was penniless. An acquaintance
paid his passage to Virginia City when
there were flush times in that place and
Wedekind recouped by tuning pianos at
$15 per piano and earning from $45 to $60
per day.
Old Man to the Front.
But the speculative spirit in him was
still strong and, when the Comstock boom
was over. Wedekind was no better off
than before. He liked Nevada and event
ually found his way to Reno. Here he
eked out a scanty living by tuning and
repairing pianos. He was now over 60
years old, but hope and determination
were still conspicuous in his make-up.
When he first appears on his buckboard
behind his dismal old white horse, mak
ing daily journeys to and from the hills,
he is Just turned 65, the time when al
most every one is ready to rest.
"Oh, ho," say many of Wedekind's
neighbors. "Wedekind is an old fool."
They have a chance to say this many
times, as Wedekind works continuously
for three long years, only stopping long
enough to tune a piano occasionally to
get money for provisions.
One day, Weciekind having found gold
in the very roadway over which practical
miners and the general public had been
daily passing for ten years, climbed to
the top of a hill. He dug and shoveled
antt carted dirt in a handbarrow many
days andâ struck gold!
Not one word^of this did he mention to
his neighbors or friends. But he sent
samples to an assayer and found that he
had struck dirt worth about $23 per ton
That V/-as not rich enough for him. So he
began again to select a site to tunnel
Miners from Virginia City chaffed him
One stuck up a derisive placard.
"Veil." said Wedekind, looking at this
attempt at humor and wearing a placid
expression, "dot is goot. too "
When Wedekind w^ 68 years old, two
years only inside of^.ie scriptural limit

to man's life, he made it known to his
neighbors that he had found ore, some of
I which had assayed as high as $10,400 per
ton! He sold the property for $175,000, as
the story goes. He then had $50,000 in
bank for ore he had taken out. Now he
has retired, and his chief pleasure is in
thinking, as he expressed it to a Call
correspondent:
"To have my friends find out that I am
not an old fool, as they said I was, ls as
better as the mine."
Prospectors Flock In.
Wedekind's discovery, which was un
] questionably one of much value, led to
j wholesale prospecting on the hills ami
mountains of \\ ashoe County, near Reno.
The odd story connected with Wedekind
I is mated with another equally queer con
1 cerning Steamboat Springs, a locality
I about thirteen miles from Reno.
Steamboat Springs has long been known
to the tourist. From time immemorial
from hundreds of crevices in the rocks
jets of steam, accompanied by a sulphur
ous smell and subterranean noises re
sembling the violent bubbling of large
: quantities of water, have given testi-
I mony to nature's incessant work in her
laboratory. These jets have been visible
from far off. During several years they
justified the maintenance of a hotel and
var>or bathe.
By and by the partial failure of the
supply of hot medicated water from the
springs near the hotel led to boring for
wells. Then some metal was discovered.
The hotel caught tire and was burned
some time ago. The ground formerly
familiar to tourists is now staked out in
mining claims. There are scores of stakes
and other evidences of mining Interest in
the view of all visitors to the steam
springs. To the casual observer it would
seem that the entire region had been
claimed. There is gold at Steamboat
Springs. That fact Is certain. How much
there is may be another question. The
ore that comes to the surface is accom
panied by scalding hot water.
"We have tapped," said a grim miner
while the steam from the water made it
appear that the ore was smoking hot,
"the n?other lode. of hell."
Rich Ores in View.
The Steamboat Springs exploitation has
increased the rush of prospectors. All the
hotels in Reno have been filled during the
last year and the hotel men have been
reaping a rich harvest. The Riverside is
building a large wing and will be replaced
by a $40,000 structure. Everybody here is
anticipating a boom. There are prospec
tors in the Pea Vine district near Reno
at Tuscarora, at Pyramid, at Olinghouse
Canyon, In the Wedekind district and at
Steamboat Springs, all of which are trib
utary to Reno. At each of these places
actual mining is progressing.
The Wedekind property was purchased
by the Sparks Mining Company, in which
the principal owner is John Sparks. Ad
joining is the property which was worked
for a short time by Bell of Colorado
This is now tied up by litigation to de
termine the rights of the Sparks Mining
Company to the land claimed by Bell and
his associates. The superintendent of the
Sparks Mining Company is C. X,. Crane
*.vho is well known to mining men from
California. He came here from Hayden
Hill. There are thousands of tons of ore
in sight. Crane says that nothing worth
less than $100 per ton is sacked. Some of
the ore assays $1000 per ton.
The most striking statement made by
Superintendent Crane is that, car for car
the ore at the Wedekin â¢ discovery has
assayed higher than that taken from the
famous discovery in the ' Tonopah dis
trict, sixty miles from Candelaria. The
company has established its store and of
fice and has built cabins for "the miners,
so that quite a camp is already in exis
tence. The company will build its own
mill and put in other plants needed. Ore
which cannot be profitably transported by
rail at existing rates will be worked up
at the mine.- Such ore now in sight is
estimated at $100,000 in value. The great
est depth of the shaft is 140 feet. No one
can foresee what this mine may do, but
it appears to have a very bright future.
The ores contain gold, silver and lead. I
* A short distance southwest from the
.wedekind discovery ex-State Senator -D.
C. Wheeler . and S. H. Wheeler have a
claim 1500x600 feet in size, where they are
prospecting. Their land looks just like
that where Wedekind made his discovery.
Tne entire- district is the same in outward
appearance, being covered with small
Etones, some of which are mineralized,
in fact.between the apex of Wedekind's
mine on the surface and the bottom of
the hill, a distance of about 200 yards,
rcughly estimated, a cartload of rock
which had been lying in plain sight and
close beside the traveled road for many
years was picked up, which gave an
assay value, of $60 per ton. .senator
Wheeler has hopes accordingly.
Other Camps Active. ' Â¦ /'. .
There is a gold, camp at Olinghouse
Canyon, which is about twenty miles
east from Reno. Three mills are going
there. , The ores are gold, medium and
nigh grade. Each of the mills running
can crush from ten â¢to , twenty tons per
ay. A scarcity of water has retarded
operations. Sheriff McGinnis is a leading
owner at .Olinghouse, having, several
claims and prospects. Â¦ â¢-.- - .
In the Pyramid mining district copper
and gold mines are being developed.

ALLEN C. BRAGG FINDS REASONS
FOR ADVANCEMENT OF NEVADA
NEVADA has awakened from her sleep of nearly twenty years
and is now attracting: much attention. 'Sot only her agri
cultural possibilities are beginning to be recognised, but her
woaderful mineral -wealth is again being sought after, for
her hills contain almost all the minerals known to science.
Her beef, mutton and lamb have always commanded' the
highest price ln the markets of the United States, and those
products are by no means a small factor in the commonwealth's
make-up. While the beef supply is not nearly so large as in for
mer years, what Nevada lacks in quantity is more than made op ln
price. I say that, take it all ln all, Nevada ls all right.
We of the sagebrush hardly ever hear of dismantled ma
chinery in the erstwhile mining camps, and nobody talk* about
them any more as being the home of the bat. coyote and snake,
so after all the silver agitation of past years ls proving to be a

Florodora Sextet Wins the Favor of a
Delighted Audience.
ANEW era has come in in doll
showp. The new regime glorifies
the vaudeville skit, the musical
numberâ in a word, the set pro
gramme of entertainment. Society
on the stage amuses society in the
boxes and in the balcony. The
dolls are relegated for the time to
the safety of side rooms and are
forgotten except in so far as the
name of the function keeps them
present in the thoughts of the pleasure
seekers.
At least such is the new doll show of
the Doctor's Daughters as seen last night
at Native Sons' Hall. Transported into a
new atmosphere, the traditions of the old
Maple room exhibition all broken, the new
function established a record all its own,
and, while many of the old-time patrons
j felt regret for the bid, most were pleased
with the new.
At night society turned â¢ out in force.
Mason street was early crowded with car
riages from Post street to far below
Geary. The beautiful women, and hand
some men of San Francisco were there,
and the assemblage resembled' that of a
first night of grand opera more than the
casual coming and going of the custom
ary doll show first night.
There were intermissions in the pro
gramme when people remembered that
there were other ways to swell the fund
of the society than simply paying the
price of admission, and at such times the
refreshment booths and the fish pond
were crowded and - "change" was not a
consideration. But the poor dolls in their
dainty dresses of white and pink silk were
utterly neglected.' The doilhouse alone
was left, moved into the vestibule, to re
mind patrons in its charming way that
the show was one of dolls and not of Bo
hemians and grown-up beauties.
The afternoon was an auspicious open
ing of the doll show. The dolls were
then all in evidence and the children were
there in numbers to admire them and the
women studied with delight the creations
of the modietes. Many sales were made
and the Doctor's Daughters felt that it
was a happy beginning.'
Florodora Sextet the Feature.
At night, however, came i the triumph,
the new conquest .of society by this par
ticular function, and it was more com
plete than ever the Maple room â¢ saw.
The society edition :of the Florodora
sextet and the Bohemian Club skit- had
every one on the gui vive. Not that the'
remainder of the programme was unat
tractive, but Florodora sextets with real
society belles and beaux in the line-up and
a vaudeville skit with' Bohemians burst
ing forth from the exclusiveness of jinks
under the redwoods are drawing cards
which are not bumped into every day.
The sextet made, a great hit. It was
different, it is true, from that of the
"pretty maidens" and "gentle . strangers",
that San Francisco learned to love it the
Columbia, but it had its own peculiar
merits. The girls were pretty and . the
men could be matinee idols if they would.
They sang well and danced well. To be'
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1901.
sure, the first time off the girls failed to
give the nod in concert, but on the en
cores they did the trick to perfection.
Among the men Frank Rodolph made the
hit. He went into the game with all tne
enthusiasm he displayed in the Stanford-
California football game two years ago
when he stopped Kaarsburg's kangaroo
plunges over the Stanford line. He made
a few foul tackles, but there was no um
pire to penalize his side, and the game
went on to the great delight of the "au
dience.
The Bohemian Club skit, "The Billion
aire," was replete with witticisms and
funny situations, and the members of tne
cast acquitted themselves with much
credit. Dr. Shiels, the fake philanthro
pist, "Lord Mornegie," kept the sympathy
of the audience in spite of his cruel
hoaxes on trusting grafters. Jack Wil
son was an ideal oil stock promoter. C. J.
Dickman, as "Schweips," the artist, con
verted a haying scene into a moonlight
with a facility that was most disillusion

even for a husky stage-struck girl, but
his exposure of short hair beneath the
picture hat and blonde wig was clever
and very fetching. Dick Hotaling was
unobjectionable as the tramp who dis

the billionaire, and Noble Eaton was a
good enough hotel clerk.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. 'Nov. B.â There was a falling
off in the volume of transactions in to-day's
stock market, but the speculation continued
notably active. There were conspicuous points
of strer-zth throughout, but the general list
moved irregularly and a number of prominent
stocks were Â«t different times above and be

largre in stocks which have been' strongest re
cently, following the custom "of the market for
Borne time past. Notable in this respect wer->
St. Paul and the Pacifies. An effort was made
at one time to renew the upward movement in
these stocks, with a resulting advance in St.
Paul ot 1% over last night's level, but the
advance met fresh realizing and was wiped

New York Central made another notable show
of Btrenrth at an extreme advance of 3%.

of a olan for a proprietary company to hold
the stocks of the Vanderbllt railroads. Penn
sylvania and its subsidiary stocks formed
another center of strength, except Baltimore
and Ohio which was reactionary on realizing-,
and the Wheeling and Like Erie stocks moved
in sympathy with this group. The Southwest
ern stocks were generally strong to the ac
companiment of reports of large earnings and
pending inereasas in disbursements. An ac
tive demand occurred for Louisville and Nash
ville and for the Atchison stocks, notably the
preferred, which touched 102%.
The buying of this stock and of Louisville
was bailed on the general argument that they
were.sellins low compared with other stocks
paying the same dividend. Â¦ The settlement of
the Northwestern Railroad controversy con
tinued to receive much attention, to-day's ver-
Fion pointing to the granting to the Union

particularly attractive to the speculative imag

ThÂ« Sub-Treasury paid to-day on that account

London Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. B.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market 'was brisker and more cheer
ful to-day, the rumor that Turkey had yielded
to France creating a favorable . Impression.
American shares were. neglected till the close,
London showing caution and taking profits be
fore to-morrow's holiday, while New York
showed apathy. On the curb there was a sud
den flare up to the amazement of everybody.
The Â¦ market was h furiously active. â¢ New York
buying everything, particularly Atclftson,' Nor
folk and Western and Chesapeake and Ohio.
There was no explanation of this burst of ac
tivity and London was much puzzled.

Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. B.â To-morrow Brad
street's will say:
Colder weather throughout the country has
stimulated retail trade in heavy clothing,
groceries, shoes and rubber goods, and this has
already been reflected in an Improved reorder
demand from Western and Southern jobbers.
Collections, too, are more satisfactory. Coun
try merchants are reported in good financial
shape and one result of this is found in the
better supply and easier tone of money. Hold
ing of cotton is reported from the South, this
being aided by the strength of the business
community generally. Higher prices have
been made for cereals. Bradstreet's figures
on world's visible supply favor the bears but
l'ttle; foreign cables are better and export de
mand has been Improved both for wheat and
corn, the strength of these being shared in
by flour, the production of which at Minne
apolis and other centers is very heavy, ana by
oats. The price situation is one of steadiness,
though some hesitation was shown during- Oc
tcber.
While nearly all industries are active, special
strength and activity have been displayed In
iron and steel.
The coal trade was in good condition pre
vious to the cold weather. It has lost none of
its strength since, and the only source of ccsrt
plaint is the small stocks in dealers' hands
and the trouble growing out of thÂ» scarcity
of cars. Raw sugar is lower, in sympathy
with the continued bearish feeling here and
abroad, and refined Is three points lower all
around. Coffee is slightly higher on smaller
crop estimates.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week
aggregate 5,469,645 bushels, as against 6 672 SRS
bushels last week and 3,555,507 bushels in th?R
week last year. Wheat exports July 1 to
date (nineteen weeks) aggregate 112 198 918
bushels, as against 66,555,7:)7 bushels last sea
son.
Failures in the United States are 191 >> R
against 172 last week, 161 In this week a year
ago, 182 in 1899 and 181 in 1898.
Canadian failures number 35 as against 22
last week and last year, 23 in 1899 and 30 In
ISSfo.
Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW , YORK, Nov. B.â R. G. Â¦ Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say, to-morrow: .
Little relief has been afforded the leading
manufacturing Industry In the matter of trans
porting facilities. In fact, the situation on the
whole is less satisfactory since inability to se
cure coke has brought about the banking of
some of the furnaces. This in turn tends to
harden the market for pigiron. As this in
dustry is considered the best business barom
eter, present conditions and future prospects
are certainly most encouraging.
In -woolens there is a free movement of
women's dress goods and orders are plentiful
in heavyweight lines for immediate delivery.
The season has reduced manufactured stocks
cf heavy wool goods and worsteds to a low
point and recent unprecedented buying of raw
material indicates that orders come forward
freely.
Leather is held Â«t the best prices of the
season and dry hides rose further on heavy
sales. Low temperature in grain-growing
States brought a higher level of quotations.
Wheat is moving out freely at coasts, ship
ments from the United States for the week
amounting to 5,651,727 bushels, against 3,210,164
bushels in the same week of 1900.
Coffee advanced despite the record-breaking
supply.
Failures for the week numbered 243 in the
United States against*2ol last week and 23 in
Canada aeainst 18 last year.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. B.â Profit-taking was popu
lar early in the wheat pit, as the result of
disappointing cabjps. December opened a shade
higher to a shade lower at 72%@72%c, and sold
rapidly down to 72% c. For a time the mar
ket took everything offered and then it was
suddenly discovered that the pit was oversold.
Bullish news began to arrive, tfhere was a
report of scanty rainfall for the late sown
crop and the flour situation was reported
strong with prices up 10c. This brought a
sudden bulge, frightened the shorts and De
cember reacted to 73%@73%c. Prices West wera
still strong, but otherwise most outside war
kets were weaker. Professionals seemed to
be controlling affairs and near the end of the
session when they were satisfied with profits
December sagged off again and closed steady,
a shade higher, at 72% c.
Corn was somewhat Irregular over a narrow
ranse, with a moderate downward tendency.
December corn closed weak, %c lower, at 59Vic.
Oats held well, considering the general liqui
dation. December closed hie lower at 38%@
38% c.
Provisions .were dull and steady. Pork closed
unchanged, lard 2%c up and ribs a shade

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign rffarkets were firm and
Liverpool and Paris futures were higher.
Private wires from Chicago to local brokers
reported a strong and buoyant market there
at a slight advance. Telegrams to M. Blum
& Co. said that prominent houses were buy
ing, and that offerings were well absorbed,
but that the disposition to realize by
scalping bull checked the advance. The
tone, however, was firm and speculation
was fairly active, and there was more doing
in wheat than in the coarser grains. The crowd
was short. The Modern Miller was very bull
ish on dry weather and the large feeding of
wheat to live stock. Paris was a free buyer
at New York. The Southwestern farmers of
fered very sparingly.
Wires to Bolton, De Ruyter & Co. called at
tention to the appearance of Mexfto as a buyer
in the American market, owing to the light
corn^ crop down there and to the removal of
the import duty on wheat, and said that Mex
ico would probably take a good deal of wheat
from this country- A Chicago house has sold
300,000 bushels to Mexico during the past two
days, the grain to be shipped from San An
tonjo, Texas. There was aiso a similar quan
tity sold from other Southewstern points. In
terior Argentine conditions were reported im
proved.
This market was higher, both on call and in
the shipping market, and the feeling was
strong all around.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The tendency in Butter is toward lower
prices, as there Is altogether too much on the
market. Dealers have been making conces
sions to buyers for several days.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.

shipping demand and the local inquiry was cot
brisk enough to absorb all offerings, hence
more or less stock was carried over. Good
Muscats alone were scarce and sold oft readily.

crop are green yet and therefore undesirable,
and old goods are somewhat lower. Lemons

less than one-half the quantity received last
week, still there is ample on hand to suddlv
all pressing wants. A few cargoes of fuel
suitable for domestic purposes .would come to
a profitable market, as the accidents to the
British Columbia collieries have created an
opening for the sale of such coal Beside*

OAKLAND. Nov. S.â Thomas E.
Archer, a well-known insurance
man and prominent among ama

INTERNATIONAL
COURT OF CLAIMS
Project Is Presented at
I the Pan- American
Congress.
CITY OF MEXICO, Nov. S.-The Pan-
American Congress at its session this
morr.ing decided, at the suggestion of
freeident Riagosa, to adjourn lor a fort
ln order, as be cam, to allow the
committees time to consider the projects
tubn-itted to tnem.
A cablegram of felicitation was ordered
sent to Santos-Dumont, and a cablegram
of thanks for good wishes was sent to thi
Spanish Parliament.
Th<? project of the treaty for an inter
national <ourt of claims was presented
by the Mexican delegates.
In an introductory speech Francisco L
de la Barra, delegate of Mexico and
author of the project, said that it was
largely based on the Olney-Pauucefote
treaty of Janus ry 12, 1897, with modifica
tions suggested by the objections which
were made to the same treaty in the
United States Senate and which caused
that body to reject it.
Th<! proposed convention provides that
the parties thereto will bind themselves
to submit to an international court a.l
clainr.e proceeding from pecuniary losse<
end damages occasioned to any state or
: tizens on account of acts or commis
sions of another state or any of its citi
zens, provided that such claims cannot
be arranged diplomatically.
The obligation bo to submit claims com
mencs af= soon as it if demanded by any
tw contracting governments.
How the Court Will Be Formed.
The court of claims will be constituted
at ftjllows: Each contending government
shall appoint one arbitrator, who mu6t
be a :eput<-. not a native of the
inting him. and the two arbi
trator together shall elect a third one,
who -vill preside. If the two arbitrators
pree to the appointment of a
third . ask the Chief Justice of
- ipreme Court of any of the American
to designate a third arbitrator,
not be a native of any of the
â¢ :ed in the controversy.
\e states requesting the arbi
n be mort than two each shall ap

OAKLAND SPORTSMAN AND HIS BIG STRING OF STRIPED BASS THAT
HE CAUGHT IN AN HOUR AND A HALF NEAR THE FLOOD GATES OF
LAKE MERRITT, THE CATCH BREAKING THE RECORD.
more than fifteen pounds each. Archer is
much elated over his success, for it is
quite unprecedented in the annals of bay
fishing. He declares that in all of his ex
perience he never saw the equal of. the
magnificent string of striped bass that
were exposed to-day to the admiring gaze
of many devotees of the piscatorial sport.
It was also the first time on record tnat
such a quantity of this species was found
in the lake. That sheet of water uas
never been noted as a fishing ground, al
though occasionally a small bass two,
three or four pounds in weight, would be
hauled in by patient anglers. Mr. Archer
was attracted to Lake Merritt in his
search for good fishing ground by seeing
a small striped bass that was caught in
the lake yesterday. Realizing what good
sport a run of the fish would make, he
started out this morning to try hi-: for
tune.
Locating near the Twelfth-street dam
floodgates, he cast his line and awaited
with pole in hand for results. The first
bass Archer landed after a hard fight
was thirty-five inches long and weighed
seventeen pounds. This monster battled
with his captor gamely and merrily
enough to satisfy any fisherman. Three
times the hooked fish reeled out a hun
dred yards of line, and when it finally quit
the battle Archer had to gaff his prize to
thus appointed will secure the appoint- |
ment of the presiding officer in tne same
manner as above indicated. The presid
ing arbitrator will have the casting of a
vote in case of a tie.
Sentence must be rendered within three
months from the date on which the case
is closed. If the sentence is unanimous
it will be final, save that within two
months its revision by the same court
may be demanded in case its publication
gives rise to doubts of various interpre
tations; or in case it fails to decide any of
the points at issue the court will decide
the case anew and definitely within one
month of the date of the application for
a revision.
Losing Party May Appeal.
If the original sentence was rendered by
a majority of the voters only the losing
party may appeal to an international
court composed of five members, of whom
two will be selected by the heads of the
contending states, four of those thus
elected appointing a fifth or proceeding as
above indicated in case of railure to come
to an agreement as to the fifth. But, if
in case of a non-unanimous sentence, no
appeal is taken within three months, the
sentence shall become irrevocable. In
case an appeal is taken the case shall be
considered and decided irrevocably by the
court of appeal, constituted as above,
within such a period of time as it may
fix. Both the court of claims and the I
court of appeals may order the payment
of court expenses by either of the con
tending parties, otherwise the parties
must share the court expenses equally.
Each of the contending parties shall pay j
its private expenses. The high contract- I
ing parties in the treaty obligate them
selves in good faith to comply with the
stipulations of the treaty, but If any state
fails bo to comply other states may sub- |
scribe to collective Kotes of censure whicn
shall become public and official, provided
it is subscribed by at least three of the
contracting states.
The treaty is to remain in force five
years, counted from the date on which
the exchange of ratifications by at least
three of the states 6hall take place. Any
state may withdraw from the convention
one year after giving notice to that effect.
The Mexican delegation at this morn
ing's session of the conference presented
a project on international sanitary regu
lations based on the most recent scientific
discoveries.
The Brazilian delegation presented a
project of a treaty whereby arbitration
is proclaimed not as obligatory but as o
regular means of settling international
controversies among the republics of
America.
MAD DOG GIVES POLICE
SERGEANT A HARD CHASE
Demoralizes a Millinery and a Cigar
Store and Is Killed in a Pri
vate Residence.
A mad dof? on Montgomery avenue, near
Green street, gave Sergeant Christensen
and Police Officer Robert Silvey a bad
half hour last night. The dog was In
front of the drug store, at 509 Montgomery
avenue, and was acting queerly. Ser
geant Christensen threw a rope oveT the
dog, but it got away.
The animal darted into the adjoining
cigar store, overturned boxes of cigars
and a nickel in the slot machine and got
out again before Christensen and Silvey
could get hold of him. His next place
was the millinery store of Mrs. Wittman
at 523 Montgomery avenue, where he
wrecked a number of opera bonnets.
From there he went into an adjoining ilat
and hid under the bed.
In an endeavor to get out of the last
place of refuge the dop got tangled up
in a chair, and was unable to extricate
himself. Christens=en ended his existence

eight inches, one thirty-three inches and
one thirty-one inches, were captured, to
gether with three that ran the usual mar
ket size of four or five pounds.
After presenting two of the largest bass
to friends. Archer had his string photo
graphed.
"Fishing is my hobby," eaid Mr. Archer
this afternoon at his offices in the Cen
tral Bank block, "and I indulge it to the
limit. I have fished in lakes, rivers, bays
and ocean, but never ran across such a
find as this one. It will make some of
the San Francisco fishermen stare when
they hear of seventeen pound striped bass.
One might travel the boundaries of the
bay and never strike such a catch as this
one. The striped bass, as sportsmen all
know, furnishes peculiarly good sport, and
to land these big fellows was a job that
any lover of rod and reel will appreciate.
'I have caught striped bass off Angel
Island in Raccoon Straits that ran to
fair size, but nothing ever approached
this bunch. How to account for this run
in Lake Merritt I do not know, except
that these big fellows must have been
attracted by a school of young smelt,
which probably worked In with the tide "'
Archer was besieged all day with in
quiries from fishermen who heard of the
extraordinary catch.
CLUBMAN FAILS
TO PAY ALIMONY
Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ ?
Otto A. Bernard Refuses
to Support His Minor
Child.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 8.
Woefully in arrears is Otto A. Bernard,
a San Francisco society and club man,
who was ordered to pay his divorced wife,
Lilly M. Bernard, $25 every three months
for the support of their minor child, and
Judge Ellsworth has cited him to appear
in court Friday, November 22, to show
cause why it is that he owes $250 on the
alimony account.
According to an affidavit filed by Mrs
Bernard to-day she was divorced from her
husband in October. 1897, when it was de
creed by an Alameda County Judge that
he should pay her $25 quarterly for their
child's support. Bernard kept up the pay
ments, it is alleged, only until April 5
1899, since Which time he has absolutely
refused to contribute any more money.
Now the delinquencies amount to $250 ana
the wife wants to know why she cannot
get an allotment from her late husband.
Bernard was before the court a year ago
for neglecting- to satisfy the demands of
his wife. He appeared in court dressed
as becomes a society gentleman and
calmly told the court that he hadn't any
moneyâ that his present wife who is
worth $100,000, gave him pin money now
and then and paid his dues in the Bohe
mian Club, but it wasn't enough to pay
alimony with. The court scored him for
failing to support his own child.
Goff Is President Again.
At last night's meeting of the Labor
Council Walter H. Goff, who was forced
to withdraw as a delegate from the Labor
Council by a ruling of the Building Trades
Council, but who was reinstated, was
elected to his former position as presi
dent. As soon as Goff entered the hall
President Michael Casey tendered his
resignation as a compliment to the for
mer presiding officer, who was elected by
acclamation, receiving a rousing cheer as
he took his seat. The reinstating of Goff
with other delegates who were compelled
to withdraw under a similar ruling, is a
direct slap at P. H. McCarthy and his
Building Trades Council, who are accused
as being the direct cause of all that
trouble. This, and a declination, of some
carpenters to quit work at the behest of
the walking delegate of the Building
Trades Council yesterday, is not intended
to smooth over some of the rough ridges
left by the late election. The council de
clared a boycott against the football game
between Berkeley and Stanford, which
comes off this afternoon at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets. Similar action was taken
against Meese, Gottfried & Co., the Reli
ance Machine Works and the Risdon Iron
Works. The boycott was raised from the
Compressed Air Machine establishment
because it complied with union rules.
The wise man wh* knows more than his
wife is? unwise if he tries to conceal his
knowledge from her.
NATION'S HEAD
TO VISIT WEST
Chief Executive Informs
Dr. Wheeler of His
Intentions.
University President Denies
Story of Appointment to
Foreign Office.
BERKELEY, Nov. 8.--President Benja
min Ide Wheeler returned to-day from a
three weeks' trip in the East, and pre
sided at the semi-monthly university
meeting held at 11 o'clock in Har
mon gymnasium. He announced to the
students that in a personal talk with
President Roosevelt the chief executive
had said it was his intention to visit this
coast as soon as the business of the next
session of Congress is over. This will
bring him here some time during the sum
mer.
The main purpose of his visit, so Presi
dent Wheeler stated, will be to inspect
the conditions of the arid lands of the
West, so that he can recommend to Con
gress some action to be taken to reclaim
the waste territory. Dr. Wheeler said
that he believed President Roosevelt will
urge a large appropriation by Congress
for the irrigation of Western lands as a
national benefit.
President Wheeler denied the account
recently published that he would receive
the appointment of Ernbassador to Ger
many. When asked if the statements
were true that he would receive an ap
pointment from President Roosevelt's
hands, he classed them as "nonsense"
without the slightest foundation of truth.
"I would rather the matter would not be
mentioned," he said, "as it simply brings
it again to public mind. It is absurd."
The meeting this morning was address
ed also by Dr. Thomas Aadison, Pacific
Coast agent of the General Electric Com
pany, who spoke interestingly on the work
in the broad school of life.
President Wheeler's address to the stu
dents was in part as follows:
I very much enjoyed visiting old Yale and
giving to her the felicitations you sent. There
is a kind of virility and abundance of spirit
here that reminds one of Yale. Yale is not rich,
but like ourselves has been in need. The old
buildings there are the ugliest I have seen ex
cept the ones here. Yale hasn't much money,
but she has any amount of loyalty from those
who have studied within her walls.
It is always good to meet a man who is a
man and that's what Theodore Roosevelt Is.
There is no suspicion but he is a whole man â
a masculine man â and that's the kind of a man
to be. He has entered office looking things In
the face as realities, so that he might live and
act in the real. He is not afraid to act In the
light of what he sees to be facts. It was in
teresting to notice how anxious he was to get
at the actual facts. There seemed to be a posi
tive yearning in his mind to get at the real
status of things. In talking with him he ex
pressed his great desire for better information
regarding the country's needs.
I told him that to become acquainted with
things he ought to look at them. He told me
that he had decided just as soon as Congress
was through its session to come to this coast.
So he will be here next summer. He is coming
out to the Pacific Coast in order that he may
become acquainted with conditions on the Pa
cific strip. He is very much interested in af
fairs in the section west of Kansas and he is
prepared to take an active hand in the irri
gation of the arid West. He sees in It a na
tional duty. He will not hesitate to support a
national contribution for irrigation of the West
ern lands the same as he would advocate im
proving rivers and harbors. It is a national
policy with him to turn toward the arid West.
He knows the country is not a desert, as most
people think, but a waste which can be made
fertile through proper means.
lam glad to be back among you. There is no
place I have seen so good as Berkeley. I am
back here for the purpose of attending the foot
ball game to-morrow and I want you all to be
there behind that team. Be a body of stu
dents until noon to-morrow and then be a body
of football enthusiasts. Put your minds on vic
tory and hypnotize that team into carrying the
ball across the line.
President Wheeler, besides attending thÂ»
bicentennial celebration at Yale, visited
Washington, Chicago and other Eastern
cities. He held conferences with many
scholars for the purpose of looking over
material for the university faculty. He
also made arrangements for men to come
here to teach at the next summer session
and opened negotiations with others.
President Wheelers selections for new
faculty men will not be announced until
after the regents have taken action on
them.
President Wheeler stated that John Ga
len Howard, the New York architect,
would start for this city next Monday to
look over the grounds with the view uf
taking up the general superintendency of
the construction of the new university
buildings.
WILL BREAK
MAIL RECORDS
Remarkable Time to Be
Made Half Around
the Globe.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â When the Cunard
| liner Umbria sails to-day she will carry
j a batch of mail matter that arrived in
[ San Francisco on last Monday on the
steamship Ventura from Sydney and
Auckland. It will be the speediest mail
delivery ever accomplished in the world
more than half-way around the globe,
by steam at sea and steam on land and
steam at sea again, in less than thirty
days.
The New York Central Railroad will de
liver the mail bag â which includes several
bagsâ on board the Cunarder within five
minutes of her sailing time this morning
and the steamship will have the letters
in the London postoffice on the morning
of November 16. It will beat the fiction
of Phineas Fogg by twenty days.
The Ventura left Melbourne, Australia,
on October 14, bound for San Francisco
by way of Sydney, Auckland and Hono
lulu. From Melbourne to San Francisco
the distance is about 9200 miles; from Syd
ney it is about 8500 miles; from Honolulu
2600 miles. The Ventura stopped at each
of these ports. She arrived at Sydney
late on the 15th and her average speed
was about 400 knots in twenty-four
hours. From Sydney it took her three
days to Auckland, and from Auckland to
the Hawaiian Islands eleven days.
Her passage from Honolulu to the
Golden Gate was exceptionally speedy,
although it did not break the high record.
The Ventura anchored in American
waters on the morning of November 4.
The mail bags were brought ashore and
placed on the regular mail trains of the
Southern Pacific and then run over the
Union Pacific, the Burlington and the
Lake Shore and then to the New York
Central.
The first feat of this sort was on Sep
tember 7. The run was made over the
Central and the mail was put on board
the Campania on that date and delivered
in the London postoffice and made ready
for distribution on the morning of Sep
tember 14. This run was not like that
which will be finished this morning. A
special train was run on the Lake Shore
road from Chicago to Toledo, and ripped
over the rails at sixty miles an hour,
overtaking the fast mail which had left
two hours before.
To-day's mail delivery will be by regu
lar transcontinental mail trains. The ex
treme distance from Melbourne to London
by way of San Francisco and New York
is 15,265 miles.
Nearly 11,000 miles of the new route be
tween England and its far away colony
are covered by American ships and rail
way trains. The beating of the last rec
ord of 31% days will prove that mail can
be taken through New York more quickly
than through the Suez canal and much
more quickly than by the all-water route.
"This," says the editor of the Preston
(Kans.) Plalndealer, "is the only paper in
Kansas that has been under the same
management for eleven years, never
missed an issue and never paid out a dol
lar for labor."

CUTS HIS WIFE
WITH A RAZOR
Painter Keeffe Slashes
Spouse Twice on
Left Side.
Cornelius J. Keeffe, a marine painter
living at 29A Morris avenue, seriously cut
his wife with a razor early this morning.
He was arrested and charged at the
Southern police station with an assault
with intent to commit murder.
Keeffe began drinking during the early
part of the night and while his wife w^s
temporarily absent he retired. Mrs. Keclte
returned with her sons by a former mar
riage later, and endeavored to rouse her
husband.
He was in an ugly mood and proceeded
to demolish the furniture. During the
scuffle a lamp was overturned, and Gil
bert Fackspader, Keefe's stepson, a
young man about 21 years of age, and his
younger brother, aged 17, went to the as
sistance of their mother.
Picking up the overturned lamp, Gilbert
proceeded to beat his stepfather over the
head with the lamp chimney. Keeffe
turned on his wife, and drawing a razor
slashed her twice on the left side. Tht
boys continued to protect her and finally
drove Keeffe out of the house. One of
them called Officer R. H. Beamer, who
arrested Keeffe and took his wife to the
Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Millar, who attended her, found two
deep wounds in the left side. One was
under the armpit and the other on the
left breast. The eldest boy was also cut
slightly upon the throat during the scuffle.
Mrs. Keefe was placed in bed at the Re
ceiving Hospital, as her wounds were too
serious to permit of her removal.
Mrs. Keeffe has been married three
times and has had one child by each hus
band. Keeffe has been drinking heavily
of late and f?ets into an ugly temper
when intoxicated. The prompt action of
Mrs. Keefte's eldest son prevented the
house from taking fire when the lamp
was overturned.

FLATLY REFUSE
TO CONSOLIDATE
Plymouth Congregation
alists in Opposition
to a Union.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway. Nov. 8.
A war between the Congregational
churches of North Oakland is imminent.
Its basis is the effort which is being madÂ©
to force a consolidation of Plymouth
Congregational Church and the Fourth
Church. Plymouth's people declare they
do not desire to amalgamate, while the
leaders in Oakland Congregationalism be
lieve that there is not room enough for
the two organizations in the same terri
tory.
It is an old story, this fight on consoli
dation, but it did not reach a crucial point
until last evening, when a church council
was held. The delegates were from the
First Church and from the two churches
directly in interest, as follows:
First Churchâ Mr. and Mrs. C. Z. Merrltt,
Mr. and Mrs. Russell Whitman, Mrs. A. H.
Bridgman, Mrs. S. F. Swain, Miss Emily
Swain, Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Keyes, John Rob-
Ins. Fourth Churchâ E. T. Letter, Charles
Irving, George S. Naismith. James Mitchell,
John Mitchell. Mrs. S. Wright. Mrs. George
Naismith. George Leiter. E. Paltoe. Plymouth
Churchâ Miss Belle Keefer, Miss Carrie Pulei
fe-r, A. A. Jones. Joseph Bacon. Mrs S K.
Love. Mrs. Tenney, S. S. Batchelder, Edward
White, Mrs. Bennetts, Dr. George Mooar.
The Fourth Church people, whose house
of worship is located at Thirty-fourth anu
Adeline streets, desire to move east nearer
San Pablo avenue, but the Plymouth com
municants, who worship at Thirty-fourth
street, near Telegraph avenue, object to
the invasion of what they declare is their
territory. And they object also to con
solidation. Therefore the council was
called in a desire to straighten the tangle.
But it is not straightened.
After a long executive session, of which
Judge J. M. Haven was chairman and C.
Z. Merritt secretary, the council was ad
journed without action. The opponents of
consolidation succeeded in keeping that
cuestion away from the chair. They de
clined to join in a call for another coun
cil.
It remains now for the Fourth Church
peoDle to say whether they shall change
their base of operations. Invade Ply
mouth's territory, as claimed, and fight it
out for support.
More Philippine Teachers Wanted.
BERKELEY. Nov. B.â Mrs. May L.
Chei.ey, appointment secretary at the
University of California, has recei'-ed a
letter from F. W. Atkinson, superintend
ent of public instruction in the Philip
pines, asking- her to recommend twenty
young men for teachers in the Islands at
$1200 a year. He will cable for them as
required. Superintendent Atkinson stated
that no more women teachers would be
appointed, as there were no further ac
commodations for them in the islands. He
congratulated Mrs. Cheney on her selec
tions, declaring that the California men
and women were second to none as
teachers.
Licensed to Marry.
OAKLAND, Nov. B.â Licenses to marry

PEACE ABIDES
AT THE ISTHMUS
Commanders Send Re
ports to the Navy
Department.
Severe Measures Are Being
Taken for Raising
. of Funds.
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â The Navy De
partment has received mail advices from
both sides of the Isthmus of Panama
touching the revolutionary conditions.
From the west side Captain Perry of the
lowa reports at Panama and on the gulf
side Commander McCrea, on the Machia^,
submitted a report from Colon. These re
ports are Important as throwing light oa
the political conditions there rather than
as conveying news of warlike conditions.
They are as follows:
U. S. S. IOWA, PANAMA. COLOMBIA, Oct.
25, 1901.â Sir: I have the honor to report that
all is quiet and peaceful in and about Panama.
The activities reported in my letter last week
on the part of the insurgents and government
forces quickly subsided and nothing whatever
came of It. There are no insurgent troops in
the neighborhood of Panama City. The re
port that they had left Chorrera is not be
lieved now. In a word the condition of affairs
in Panama is normal.
Tumaco, near the Ecuadorean border, has
fallen into the hands of the insurgents. Dur
ing the week the Chilian cruiser Ministro Zen
teno arrived in Panama road with an envoy ex
traordinary on board accredited to Ecuador and
the Central American Republic. They re
mained two days and then sailed for Costa
Rica.
The French cruiser Protet remains the only
man-of-war in the harbor besides the lowa.
The British gunboat Icarus is at Taboga. Very
respectfully. THOMAS PERRY.
Captain U. S. N., Commanding U. S. S. lowa.
U. S. S. MACHIAS, COLON. REPUBLIC OF
COLOMBIA, Oct. 29. 1901.â Sir: I have to re
port the usual quiet conditions* prevailing In
Colon and along the north coast of the isthmus.
The Colombian gunboat Pinzon made a round
trip to Bocas del Toro during the week, touch
ing at intermediate points and she reports all
quiet to the west. I incite papers showing
to what miserable straits the local authorities
have been reduced to raise funds, and am not
surprised that the steamship companies have
agreed to protest. If this path is once opened
to protect the sinews of war and no protests
are made there 13 no limit to the annoyances
which will follow and traffic over the railroad
would be seriously interfered with. This reso
lution doubles the harÃor dues, which, are
lumped together and called "the commercial
contribution"; if meekly acquiesced in, steam
ship lines might be diverted from running
here, which would of course, injure the traffic
on the railroad.
The department .has been informed as to the
various ways by which the local authorities
have raised funds, such as hypothecating all
the dues from the Panama Railway Company
for six months to come, adding 20 per cent.
and then doubling the customs dues on all
articles and by levying "war taxes" or assess
ments upon all solvent Colombians. These
measures, if taken by the Republic of Colom
bia and h>l ireed throughout, would perhaps be
Justifiable ,h war measures. But when asso
ciated with the discontent, almost amounting
to revolt, among the soldiers because of no
pay, it looks as though the funds being raised
are for some other purpose than suppressing
the revolution. HENRY McCKEA,
Lieutenant Commander U. S. N. Commanding.

HIGHBINDER WAR
SEEMS IMMINENT
Chinese Six Companies
Not Able to Bring
About Peace.
Rival Tongs Say That Blood
Will Alone Appease
Their Wrath.
The far-reaching arm of Chinese ven
geance was revealed last night at a meet
ing of the Six Companies. Representa
tives of the Wong family appeared before
that organization and declared that the
surrender of Wong Chut to the police
would involve a frightful loss of life, not
only In San Francisco., but also in China,
where hundreds of innocent Mongolians
would perish in retaliation for American
interference in highbinder affairs.
"We dare not turn this man over to the
police," the Wong family's spokesman
said. "His family is one of the most pow
erful in China and when we considered
the Chin family's plan to allow the Ameri
can courts to mete out justice we received
&i\ ultimatum that violent death, sooner
or later, would be our fate. The ulti
matum stated that the man's family woulti
not tolerate any deviation from the oIJ
honored custom of permitting Chinese ie
c their own difficulties. !_>ea.th would
not only be visited upon those who would
surrender Wcng Chut, but upon the wit
nesses. In fact all the members of the
local long would feel the force of the tor
ribie vengeance.
"The threat extended further. Not only
would the Wongs of San Francisco be
come targets for bullets, but their rela
tivts in China would be slaughtered by
the hundreds."
Threatening Messages Sent.
This is the first time that the local Chi
nese have ever proposed the American
courts as a medium through which to
work out their revenge. Heretofore when
a. murder has been committed the ton?
to which the murderer belonged either
paid the price of the crime in blood or
coin. So closely has this custom been ad
hered to that the victim's own brother
would refuse to give testimony against
the slayer were the latter arrested and
brought in the courts. Now the resent
ment for the new plan is shown in vhe
threatening message sent to the local
Wong*.
Wong Chut shot and killed Chin Chow
about two weeks ago. Chut was a mem
ber of the Hop Sing Tong. but the Chins
regarded family affiliations more than
tong membership, and hence made t:ie
demand upon the Wong family for lr.s
surrender. They made a bold and novel
proposition. They ordered the Wongs to
turn the murderer over to the police and
said that they would furnish six witnesses
for the prosecution.
The Chins extended the time for the de
livery until midnight Thursday. If the
man was not behind prison bars by that
time they vowed to kill five Wong men
and offered large inducements to their
highbinders to do the work. The man
va? not surrendered at the appointed
time, and the hatchetmen started out to
earn their rewards, which ranged from
$500 to $1500. according to the importance
of the Wong mÂ»n who might be slain.
Efforts Made to Prevent Bloodshed.
The Six Companies took a hand in the
trouble in an effort to prevent bloodshed.
The officers of each of the warring fac
tions were cited to appear and explain
their cases. The meeting last night was
accordingly arranged and the parties ap
peared under special griard.
When the Wong men told of their fears,
the hope that Wong Chut would ever
reach prison vanished. It was then urged
that the Chins accept a sum. of money lor
the life of Chin Chow, but this they re
fused to do, and announced their deter
mination to kill five of their rivals, as
they had previously avowed. The "Wongs
in turn will send out their hatchetmen
and will attempt to retaliate by killing
Chins.

FLYING TRIP OF THE STEAMSHIP PUEBLA
FROM PUGET SOUND TO SAN FRANCISCO
Sails From Flattery to the Golden Gate in Record Time and
Her Commander Says She Can Make a Better Show
ing When Called Upon â Two Transports to Depart
THE Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's City of Puebla has made a
flying run from the Sound to San
Francisco. Fifty-three hours from
Victoria, B. C, is railroad time,
and many of the liners would be pleased
to own the record.
The Puebla has recently been over
hauled and is now a good seventeen-knot
ship. Captain Jepsen has never rushed
her. however, but when he left Seattle
five hours behind time and there seemed
no reasonable means of making up the
lost hours he decided to make time. .In
consequence from the hour Flattery was
passed everything was wide open and the
vessel came in on time. The Puebla
brought in a big crowd of passengers and
will be ready to sail again on time.
All the passengers were more than
pleased with the vessel's showing, and
Captain Jepsen says that no one knows
Just what his boat can do. Next trip he
expects the Puebla to make the run in
forty-eight hours.
Movement of Transports.
The Grant is scheduled to sail on the
15th inst. She will carry one regiment
and a number of civilians.
The Meade is also scheduled to sail on
the 16th. Among her passengers will be
a number of non-commissioned officers
wives and their children.
The Meade will probably sail from here
on her last run, while the Grant will be
laid up on her return here.
Water-Front Notes.
The Harbor Commissioners made a tour
of the front yesterday morning. Accom
panied by the chief engineer and chief
wharfinger, they inspected the docks

foot of Powell ftreet. Many of the struc
tures were pronounced dangerous and new
wharves will be built as soon as the
board can obtain the money from the

from the East, where he went as repre
sentative of the Foresters at the Buffalo

Selects a Local Rabbi.
Information was received in this city
last night that Dr. Victor Rosenstein has '
been chosen rabbi of a syngogue in Taco
ma. Although Dr. Rosenstein was never '
a rabbi in any of the local synagogues,
he is well known here. For three weeks
he read the service in the Bush-street
synagogue. During the recent Jewish
holidays he officiated In Tacoma, and it is
supposed that his able service during that
time earned for him his present position. >
POLICE ARREST
A BAY PIRATE
Exciting Chase Out by
by the Seven-Mile
House.
Band of Thieves Loots Large
Quantity of White
Paint.
Numerous complaints have been sent to
police headquarters of the operations of
a gang of bay pirates who have been
stealing goods from vessels in the bay.
Captain Seymour detailed Detective
Crockett on the case, and Thursday he
got a clew in the shape of a strange sloop
that was 'seen going in the direction of
Mission Bay. He was also able to dis
cover that three men were in the habit of
hiring a wagon from Lambert's stables
at Fifth and Folsom streets.
Crockett stationed himself in a house
near the stables and shortly after dawn
yesterday morning he saw two men drive
out of the stables with a wagon. He
quickly hired a buggy and trailed behind
them till they reached the beach near the
Seven-mile House, San Bruno road. The
men had stolen a large quantity of white
paint from a schooner lying at Third anu
Kentucky streets. It belonged to W. P.
Fuller & Co. They had loaded the palm
into the sloop and sailed with it to Mis
sion Bay, where they unloaded it Thurs
day night and piled it on the beach near
the Seven-mile House.
Crockett watched them till they began
loading the paint into the wagon and he
telephoned to the Potrero station for Po
liceman Ennis. As soon as Ennis arrived
they advanced upon the pirates, who saw
them coming and jumped into the wagon,
driving off furiously. They drove against
a fence and jumped off. Crockett rired a
shot at.pne of them. He chased anotiier
of the gang through pig pens and sloughs
till he overtook nlm and soon had the
handcufts on him. The other two escaped.
The captured pirate gave his name as
John Reed. He had a revolver in ni:
pocket, and when the officers went to the
sloop they found another loaded revolver
and a dark lantern. The white lead was
marked "A. R.," which is \v . f. tU;...
& Co.'s private mark. Crockett and Ennis
loaded the wagon and Crockett drove into
the city with it and his prisoner, while
Ennis remained to keep guard over the
sloop. Reed was placed in "the tanks."
A search will- be made for his two con
federates.

FIGHT AGAINST
ASIATIC LABOR
Special Committee Pre
pares for Exclusion
Convention.
The special committee of the Board of
Supervisors appointed to make arrange
ments for holding a Chinese exclusion
convention in this city November 21 met
yesterday afternoon in the Mayor's office.
The reports presented to the committee
indicate that gyreat interest is being man
ifested throughout the State in the pro
posed convention.
The secretary of the committee reporte-J
that a large number of replies to the call
for a convention have been received and
that many of the most prominent citizens
in the State were enlisted in the work oi
securing the re-enactment of the law pre
venting cheap Asiatic labor from coming
into this country. The reports showel
that the city and county officials in th-3
interior of the State have selected dele
gates to attend the convention, as also
have many commercial bodies, improve
ment clubs and trade and labor unions.
All indications point to the convention
being numerously attended and in being
most successful in arousing public Inter â¢
est in the tight.
After the committee had discussed the
question of Chinese exclusion in its vari
ous phases the proposition was made to
divide the subject into parts and to lnvit*
specialists to prepare papers on separate
topics for presentation to the convention.
Specialists will be selected to consider the
industrial phase of Chinese immigration,
the Chinese as non-consumers of Ameri
can products and as competitors of Amer
ican labor. An interesting programme
has been.outlined.
Among the prominent men who^hav-*
signified their intention of being present
is ex-Congre3sman Thomas J. Geary, the
author of the present law. Congressman
Woods is engaged in gathering material
for an address on the exclusion act. Ex-
Speaker of the Assembly Alden Anderson
of Suisun will also take part in the con
vention.
