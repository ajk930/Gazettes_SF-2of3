2:15 a. m. He had been uncon
scious since 7:50 p. m. His last
conscious hour on earth was
spent with his wife, to whom he
devoted a lifetime of care. He
died unattended by a minister -'of
the Gospel, but his .last words
were a humble submission to the
will of the God in whom he be
lieved. He was reconciled to the
cruel fate to which an assassin's
bullet had condemned him and
faced death in the same spirit of
calmness which has marked his
long and honorable career. His
last conscious words, reduced to
writing by Dr. Mann, who stood
at his bedside when they were
uttered, were:
"GOOD-BY ALL"
"Good-by, all; good-by. . It
is God's way." His will be done."
His relatives and tHe members
of his official family were at the
Milburn house, except Secretary
Wilson, who -did not avail, him
self of the opportunity,. and some
of his personal and /'political
friends took leave of him.': /This
painful ceremony; was simple.' His
friends came , to the door of the
sick room, took a longing glance
at him and turned tearfully away.
He was practically unconscious
during this time. But the'pow
erful heart stimulants, including
oxygen, were employed to re
store him to consciousness for
the final parting with his wife.
He asked for her and she sat at

his side and held his hand. He
qonspled her and bade her good

bravery and fortitude with which
she has borne the grief of the
tragedy Â« which ended his life.

The immediate cause of the
President's death is undeterm-

EW YORK, Sept. 13.â Vice Pres
ident Roosevelt will probably be
sworn in without delay to fill
| the office made vacant, by the
> death of McKinley. It Is not
necessary even that a Supreme
Court Judge should administer
the oath. This may be done by a Justice
of the Peace.
Theodore Roosevelt is the fifth Vice
President who has become President in
this way. The first was John Tyler, who
succeeded William Henry Harrison in
1841. The next was Millard Fillmore, who
became President after the death of
Zachary Taylor In 1850; Andrew Johnson
became President on the death of Abra
ham Lincoln in 1S65, "and when James' A.
Garfield died in 18S1, Chester A. Arthur
became President.
It is twenty years ago with the excep
tion of seven days since Vice President
Arthur assumed the highest office in the
land. In less than four hours after death
Â¦ had claimed President Garfield, the vic
tim of Guiteau's bullet, General Arthur
had been sworn In as chief executive of
the United States.
Death of Garfield.
It was at twenty-five minutes to 11
o'clock on the night of September 19, 1881,
that President Garfleld breathed his last
in a cottage in Elberon, N. J. At once a
telegram bearing the sad news was dis
patched by Attorney General MacVeagh
to Vice President Arthur, who was in his
home on Lexington avenue, this city.
With General Arthur were District Attor
ney Rollins, Police Commissioner French
and Kliliu Root, who is now Secretary of
. War.
v After consultation with these gentle
man it was decided by the Vice President
that he should take the oath of office
- without delay. Leaving him with Â¦ his
' private secretary. Colonel J. C. Reed, the
three gentlemen named left the house
about 1 o'clock In the morning. When
Mr. Root and Mr. Rollins returned in a
carriage they had with them Judge R.
Brady of the Supreme Court. - Scarcely
liad they entered the house when Mr.
French drove up and with him was Judge
Donohu<*, also of the Supreme Court. It
Jiad been deemed the wisest course -to
send to the homes of two judges so that
if either was away the services of the
other could be available.
Scene in Arthur's House.
The party assembled in ti.e front part
of General Arthur's house, a big room
pHelved with books, with rare old paint
ings on the walls and a bust of Henry
Clay in one corner. General Arthur stood
at a. table in the center of the room with
Â¦ the others clustered about him. As Judge
Brady had been the first to arrive, to him
fell the honor of the oath
of fealty to the Government. It was a
simple ceremony, but it was impressive,
and all of those present felt the solemnity
1 . of the occasion. From a book Judge
* Brady read the oath:
â¢ "I do solemnly swear that I will faith
j fully execute the office of President of the
! United States and will, to the best of my
ability, preserve, protect and defend the
constitution of the United States."
So deeply was General Arthur affected
as he endeavored to repeat these words
that he was forced to interrupt himself
and leave the room that he might 1 give
way to his emotion. Both Judges and
others of the party felt the stress of the
moment, and when finally the oath which
made him President of the United States
had been completed. General Arthur

WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â When the

had been on the streets restlessly and sor
rowfully awaiting news of the end hart
retired for the night, as had all the Gov
ernment officials, save a few clerks at the
State, War and Navy departments. Sec
retary' Hay had given directions what
should, be done and Acting Chief Martin
and other employes, as soon as they re
ceived official confirmation of the news,
immediately sent cablegrams to each and
every United States Embassador and
Minister, or to the Charge where the
chief diplomatic officials were absent
from their posts, notifying them that
President McKinley died at 2:15 o'clock
this morning in Buffalo and instructing
them to inform the Governments to which
they were accredited.
There were no details in the message
nothing but its brief announcement â and
they were identical in language, except in
the names of the persons addressed.
The Embassadors t and Ministers were
expected to communicate the information
in turn to" the United States Consular of
ficers within the limits of their posts.. In
cases of countries like Australia and
Canada, where the United States Govern
ment is not represented in a diplomatic
capacity, messages of like character were
eent to the United States Consuls Gen
eral, who were to repeat them to the Con
suls.
The Â¦ original message was signed by
Secretary Hay, Mr. Babcock, his private
secretary, having taken it from the State
Department to the. Secretary's home for
that purpose. This was all that the De

.Last Day Which Ends
in Despair.

MILBURN HOUSE, BUFFALO, Sept.
14.â The President's last day, which ended
in despair, was begun in hope. The ills
that came on Friday afternoon when the
organs of digestion refused to handle the
solid food that had been taken earlier in
the day had seemingly been overcome by
midnight and when the new day came it
found the President relieved and resting.
Hope, that had suddenly dropped from
the high place which it had held, began
to revive. The healing of the v/ounds had
progressed favorably, general conditions
were, in the main quite satisfactory and
the immediate future of the case seemed
to hold no threat. The physicians who
had been in almost constant attendance
during the night parted, and the watch
in the sick room was reduced.
Suddenly there was a failure of the
heart which for several days had been
manifesting slgnsi of weakness, and the
President sank toward unconsciousness.
This was at 2 o'clock in the morning.
There was an immediate application of
restoratives and a general call went out
to the absent physicians and nurses. Digi
talis, strychnine and saline solution were
administered to the patient, but there
was no immediate response to the treat
ment. The physicians admitted that ne
was desperately ill. and Secretary Cortol
you decided to send for the relatives and
close friends of the President, Vice Presi
dent and the members of the Cabtn.u.
Those within reach were called by tele
phone or messenger and telegrams were
rushed to those who had left the city.
The first of the messages were sent out
at 2:30 o'clock, and within half an hour
the Mllburn house began to nil again.
The serious condition of the President
and the general call sent out gave rise to
a' general feeling of alarm Jhat was never
again allayed. Desperate measures were
resorted to in order to stimulate the heart
and the sinking spell was over by 4
o'clock. It was decided to continue the
treatment, and the physicians laid their
greatest hope on weathering the day. " : It
was agreed that if the wounded -..'man
could be carried for twenty-four hours his
chances would be very favorable, for the
wounds were healing splendidly. .
It was decided to summon Dr.' W. W.
Johnston of Washington and Dr. E. 6.
Janoway of New York, heart specialists,
and telegrams were hurried out asking
that they come at once. Before dawn -a
desen of the relatives and friends of the
President arrived at the Mllburn house.
They assembled in the' drawing room,
where they waited for tidings from the
sick room above them. The physicians
nssurcd them- that the; Prexldent had a
fighting chnnco for his life, and to the
hope that In the' end victory would be his
they clung all day. "

CHICAGO, Sept. 11â From the win

half-mast, announcing premature
ly the "death of President McKln

her face, but the next moment her coun

Matron Kegan, "the President Is dead.

the flag. , The prisoners in an adjoining'
room to whom the news had been com
municated stood In dejected groups.
Emma Goldman alone stood unmoved.
"You officials mourn as a matter of
course," she said, with a flash of scorn
at the group.
"If I were in your position I might do
the same. The President was an ordinary
man, however, and I lament his loss no
more than that of. an ordinary laborer.
Would you weep if a common toiler wero
dead? No. Why then should I weep be
cause the President is dead?"
She crossed the room and took her seat
in a chair. Stoutly she rocked to and fro,
her lips compressed and her face set.
"No, I do not think the nation has sus

"1 am sorry- for Mr. McKinley as a man
and deplore his death as a human being,
but that is as far as my sympathy ex
tends."

NEW ADVEBTISEMENTS.
HAIR NATtTRALLY ABUNDANT.
When It Is Free of Dandruff, It Grows
Luxuriantly.
Hair preparations and dandruff cures,
as a rule, are sticky or irritating affalra
that do no earthly good. Hair, when no:
diseased, grows naturally luxuriantly.
Daridruff is the cause of nine-tenths of
all hair trouble, and dandruff is caused by
a germ. The only way to cure dandruff
is to kill the germ; and, so far, the only
hair preparation that will positively de-
stroy that germ is Ifewbro's Herpicldeâ
absolutely harmless, free from grease,
sediment, dye matter or dangerous drugs!
It allays itching instantly; makes hair
glossy and soft as silk. "Destroy the
cause, you remove the effect"â dandruff.

/T is expected that, the

but their acceptance by the

as unlikely.
All Washington Is
Shocked by the
Sad News.
? â Â¦
Hay Prepares to As
sume New Re
sponsibilities.
It Is Believed President
Roosevelt Will Make
Few Changes.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 13.â Th<*
news of the expected death
of President McKinley came
as a crushing blow to the
nation's capital. Nowhere,
perhaps, had the citizens
been so full of confidence In
the recovery of the President, and the
buoyant bulletins of the past week from
the sickbed had lulled them Into a false
sense of security, â¢which made the shock
terrible when the news that the Buffalo
tragedy would have a fatal ending came
to them.
All day long the bulletin boards were
surrounded by crowds waiting for the lat
est word from the Mllburn house. Little
work was done in the great executive de
partments, as at the slightest excuse the
clerks dropped their pens and turned to
talk of the chances that their chief mag
istrate had against death in the gallant
struggle he was making in the far-away
cltj- on the lake.
The three Cabinet officers in the capital
to-day were pictures of distress. Two
days ago Secretary Hay had left his chief
apparently on the road to recovery, and
to-day Postmaster General Smith, who
had left Buffalo even later and reached
here this morning, said when he came
from the Mllburn house yesterday that
the President was, according to his best
information, surely on the mend.
Burden on Hay's Shoulders.
The Postmaster General returned to
Buffalo on the 7;15 o'clock train to-night.
Secretary Hay had engaged accommoda
tions on to-night's New England train,
intending to return to his New Hamp
shire summer home for much-needed rest,
but canceled the order early in the day,
es on him devolved Important functions
at once on the President's demise. He
divided his time between the State De
partment and his home, waiting for the
end, prepared for his sorrowful duty or
conveying to the nations of the world in
official form the news of the demise of
the third American President through the
agency of an assassin's bullet wlthm the
short space of one human life.
As the senior member in rank of the
Cabinet, upon Mr. Hay's shoulders also
will rest the burden of the government of
the great republic In the short but Im
portant interval that must elapse before
the Vice President, under the terms of
the constitution, assumes the cares and
responsibilities of the Presidential office.
At his home In Woodley Secretary Gage
mournfully awaited the close of his chief's
life. During the day he had been at the
Treasury Department and had kept in
touch with financial affairs In order that
the President's end might not cause any
commercial disturbance that foresight on
the part of his department could avert.
General Glllespie, Acting Secretary of
War. - remained at his post in the War
Department to make such army orders as
the sad event would force him to issue.
He got into communication with General
Miles at Seattle and the latter notified the
department that he would return im
mediately.
"Will Tender Resignations.
The fact that the physicians had given
.up all hope caused some discussion among
the public men in the city of the prob
ability of an extra session of Congress
and of early changes in the Cabinet but
â¢ the consensus of opinion was that no Cab
inet changes or important departures in
public policy were at all likely for some
time to come and that Congress would not
be assembled until Its regular session in
December. All the Cabinet, the chief dip
lomatic officials and heads of the impor
tant bureaus, according to custom will
tender their resignations to relieve the
i President of embarrassment, but It is be
lieved Mr. Roosevelt would follow the
precedent of President Arthur after Gar
field's death and allow them to continue
in office. Some of the Cabinet officers are
not in good health and would sincerely
welcome a relief from their offices, but all
would waive their personal desires and
continue until such time as they could be
relieved easily. If indeed they request re
lief at all.
Under the Presidential succession act a
Cabinet officer becoming chief magistrate
would have to summon Congress in special
session; but this requirement does not
apply to a Vice President succeeding to
the office of his predecessor and It is be
lieved no extra session would be called in
the absence of statutory requirements as
the three mbnths intervening until De
cember can be bridged over without diffi
culty and there is no special occasion for
Congress assembling.
Money for Russian Railroads.
. ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 13.â A syndi
cate of German and Russian banks has
agreed, on Government guarantee, to lend
80,000,000 marks to the Moscow, Kasan,
Southeastern and Lodz railroads.
PLEA IS MADE
FOR ANARCHISTS
Nine Suspects Are Brought
Into Criminal Court at
Chicago.
CHICAGO, Sept. 13.â Hearing on _ the
writ of habeas corpus issued Wednesday
for the release of the anarchists under
arrest here began before Judge Chetlin in
the Criminal Court at 11:40 a. m. to-day^.
Judge Chetlin arrived at 11:30 a. m., and
a few minutes later the nine . prisoners
charged with conspiracy to kill the Presi
dent were led In and given seats behind
a row of bailiffs. Sheriff Magerstadt was
present. Throughout the room were Dep
uty Sheriffs and detectives in plain
clothes, the Sheriff having determined to
take every possible precaution against
trouble.
The writ of habeas corpus having been
complied with in the production of the
nine prisoners in court, counsel then made
returns in behalf of the Sheriff, the Chief
of Police and Justice Prindeville, who,
according to the petition, held the prison
ers under restraint Illegally. The prison
ers brought into court were: Abraham
Isaak, Abraham Isaak Jr., Clemens
Pfuetzner, Hippolyte Havel, Henry Tra
vagllo. Michael Roze.'Martin Roznick and
Morris J. Fox. Emma Goldman was pres
ent, but Justice Prindeville had promised
to follow whatever decision was made by
Judge ChetliÂ». - â¢ - '
Leopold Saltiel. representing the prison
ers, opened the argument, asking for the
release* of his clients on the ground that
they were being held without a shadow
of legal reason.. Attorney Saltiel claimed
that. all the papers in the case were-in
sufficient and were issued under false pre
tense. John F. Geetlng, assistant counsel
for the prisoners, followed Saltiel. Â¦
When Lawyer Geetlng ceased speaking.
Dr. Taylor, for the city, arose andsald
the. only question before the court ; was
the adequate Jurisdiction of the Justice's
Courtâ that Is, the Jurisdiction of Magis
trate. Prindeville. His ; argument , was
technical, tending to uphold the authority
of the lower court and the. legality of the
official acts of Magistrate Prindevillc.
The case was then postponed until 10
o'clock to-morrow morning, no decision
being given on any of the points raised.
City . Prosecutor Taylor, and his assist
ants were in secret conference this morn
ing concerning the habeas corpus case.
Taylor refused absolutely to say whether
any evidence against the anarchist sus
pects had been secured. Chief of Police
O'Neill said that as far as he knew no
evidence had been produced by the Buf
falo authorities; but no matter, what ac
tion^ the court might take the public could
rest\ assured that the police would keep
an eye on the anarchists, so as to be
ready for any contingency.
New Law "Will Probably Deal; With
Assailants of Presidents. , -
WASHINGTON, Sept.- 13.â Messrs. Bot
kin and Bynum, ; members : of 'the â¢ com
mission to revise and codify; the criminal
and penal laws , of " the United States,
since the attack upon the life of the Pres-
ident have been investigating the author
ities Â¦with a view, to the preparation of a
law making an assault upon the Presi
dent of the United States with the intent
to murder cognizable to the courts of the
United States and punishable by death.
They have prepared a draft of a bill to
be submitted to Congress, making assault
upon the President punishable by death
when the assault is for the purpose of
obstructing the operations. of the Govern
ment. It. is believed that this qualifica
tion will have the effect of giving the
Federal courts jurisdiction in such cases.
Czolgosz Is Guarded.
BUFFALO, SeDt. 14.â Chief Bull. said to
night with reference to rumors of the re
moval of Czolffosz:
"There is only one person to whose cus
tody ." the prisoner could be . removed and
that is the *> Sheriff of Erie County. He
has not been, turned over to him -and it
will be some time before. Czolgosz leaves
my custody. ' The arrangements we made
were to provide for any contingency that
might arise. I am now sure that there is
no danger of any trouble in this city. 'i'
DOCTORS MAY
HOLD AUTOPSY
Anxious to Determine the
Exact Cause of Presi
dent's Death.
MILBTJRN HOUSE, BUFFALO, Sept.
14.â It. is almost certain that an autopsy
on the President's body will be held to
determine the exact cause of death. This
is the wish of all the surgeons and physi
cians who were In attendance. The pecu
liar action of the President's heart was
more or less of a puzzle to all, and Dr.
McBurney expressed the opinion that in
the interest of science as well as the in
terest of the Government and the world
it was desirable that the exact cause of
death be determined.. .
The President's heart gave trouble from
the beginning, but its erratic action was
at first believed to be due to the shock
of the wound. When the wound had be-
I gun to progress favorably the heart gave
more trouble and anxiety than ever. Its
action became feeble and finally gave out
altogether.. . . â¢ Â¦
The theory of at least one of. the physi
cians is that the original shock caused by
the first wound over, the heart had much
to do with the trouble which caused death.

This startling appeal was circulated
through the city and sent to the newspa
per offices to-night. The three mfcn who
sign the proclamation calling on Chicago
to take the initiative in ridding the coun
try of anarchists and asking its citizens
to summarily take the law in their own
hands declare they did not issue it In a
spirit of bravado, but with the sober ex
pectation that it would meet with a re
sponse. Each avers he- would willingly
lead an avenging mob.
"There are times when the people should
take the law into their own hands, and
when codes and precedents are not suffi
cient," said J. Irving Pearce Jr. of the
Sherman House. "The present Is one of
those times. We want an expression of
the wish of the people, and offer them
an opportunity to make a demonstration.
Anarchy should be met by its own weap
ons. Emma Goldman, the arch conspira
tor, is the person whom we especially
wish to secure and give her a taste of
the beheading which she advocates. "When
we issued the proclamation- we meant
every, word we said, and I would volun
teer to be one of the leaders in avenging
the death of President McKinley."
Rumors of mob violence this evening
Â¦were the cause of much concern at cen
tral police headquarters and In the de
tective bureau. On the streets opinions
were freely expressed that the public
should take a hand in dealing with an
archists.
After receiving alarming reports from
the streets, Chief O'Neill issued an order
holding 100 detectives in readiness to move
at a moment's notice on the County Jail
or the Harrison-street police station in
case public sentiment grew so strong that
the ordinary police details could not pro
tect the imprisoned anarchists.

Methodist Delegates Mourn the Sad
News From Buffalo.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 13.â The erron
eous report of the President's death, re
ceived this afternoon, was announced to
the Methodist Laymen's ' Association and
as if by magic the convention broke up,
many going out weeping and others re
maining to offer prayers for the country
In its great calamity. Flags which were
half-masted when the report came ran
joyfully to the masthead when It was con
tradicted, but the deepest 'gloom of the
people was not entirely dispelled. The
sorrow exhibited Is as that for a personal
friend. - .
Bishop C. C. McCabe addressed the Lay
men's Association to-night, but instead of
speaking upon the relation of the laity
and the clergy, as He Intended, he spoke
of President McKinley.
"For," said he, "whatever we may talk
of there is only one thought in all our
hearts to-night."
He dwelt upon the grand life of the
President as man and statesman and the
gTeat love Â¦which the nation had for him.
And he gave personal reminiscences of
McKinley, the soldier, in a voice that
trembled with deep emotion.
. The feeling among Methodists here, both
clergy and laity, against Czolgosz and
anarchy in general is intense and some
organized effort against anarchy in Cali
fornia will, it. is said, result from it.

DR. JAEEWAY ARRIVES.
j Dr. Janeway of New York City ar
rived at the station at 1 1 :4O o'clock. He
was shown to the President's room at
once and began an examination of \ the
almost inanimate form. "-.
Secretary Long arrived" at the Mil
burn house at 11:06 o'clock. This was
I his first visit to the city, and he had the
I extreme satisfaction of seeing the Pres
ident alive, even though he was not
conscious of his visitor's presence.
Vice Presiderit Roosevelt had been
notified early in the day of the* critical
state of affairs. There was no longer
a doubt- .that in the approach
ing death of the President a
complete change in the exec
utive administration of the , Govern
ment would ensue. When Roosevelt
would take the oath of office was
wholly a matter of conjecture. Presi
i dent Arthur took the oath at 2 a. m.,
after the death of Garfield. , and in that
case Justice Brady of New York ad
! ministered the oath. There is no re
jquirement that the oath. shall" be admin
jistcred by a Justice of the Supreme
I Court of the United States, although
\ that procedure is adopted when circum
stances permit.
Without unseemly haste the members
of the Cabinet will tender, their resig
nations and the new President will then
ne free to initiate his own policy and
choose his own Cabinet. .
There is little possibility, to-night that
Roosevelt will get here. - Ansley - Wil
cox, who entertained the Vice Pre'si-r
'dent when he was here last, said to â¢ in
quirers that the best information he had
was that Roosevelt would be here to
morrow morning, and not until late in
the morning/ He said that the Vice
President would be unable to 'reach a
railroad station" much before 4 o'clock
to- n^orrow morning, and that would
bring him here about noon. Wilcox
said in explanation of Roosevelt's being
so far out of touch:
"The Vice Presiderit was at all times
very optimistic, and when . he ; went
away was absolutely "positive that the
President would recover and that the
convalescence would be rapid. He" cer
tainly never expected to-day's sad. oc
currence." '
THE 'CORONER ARRIVES.
Shortly after midnight the Presi
dent's breathing was. .barely .percep
j tible. His pulse had practicatly -ceased
and the extremities were cold. It was
recognized that nothing remained but
the last struggle, and some of, the
friends of the family who had remained
throughout the day began to leave the
house.
Such an intense state of- anxiety ex
isted among the watchers that rumors
gained frequent circulation that death
had already actually occurred. : The ar
ival of the Coroner pave rise to one
such rumor, and a flood of groundless
dispatches were sent sayinj? that the end
bad come. These were speedily set at
â¢est by an official statement from within
:he house that the ''reports of r death
were groundless. and that the President
still" lived. -'_ -,X,; ' # v
Coroner Wilson said that he had
seen ordered by; the District" Attorney
}f the I county, to go to the | Milburn
â¢esidence j as " soon as possible after, the
announcement of death. He had seen
a reputable local paper issued with the
announcement that the President died
at ii:o6 p. m. and had hurried up in
order that there might be no delay in
removing the body. * He was very
much chagrined when Dr. Mann met
him at the door and told him that his
services were not required and that he
would be. notified when he was wanted.
Dr. Mann said, that the President is
still alive and that Dr. Janeway was ex
amining the. heart action. There 1 was
really no hope, but he did not desire
grewsome anticipations.
Undertakers Prepare the Body; .
BUFFALO, Sept. 14.â The undertakers
occupied less than two hours in their first
treatment of the body of the dead Presi
dent. Upon their arrival they were in
formed that the body must be left unem

ingly the body was removed from the bed
in which death occurred and placed upon

autopsy is to be performed. early. In the

Bad Roads.
Special Trains in Waiting
to Speed Him On to
Buffalo.
NORTH CREEK, N. Y.. Sept It-
President Roosevelt arrived at
Aiden Lair at 3:15 a, m. The six
teen miles between that place
and this village will be covered
in the quickest possible time. A
relay of horses has been provtdad
in order that he may reach North Creek,
where his special train awaits him.
The roads are in a. very poor condition
on account of the heavy rainfall of the.
past two days and bnt slow progress can
be made. If nothing happens to prevent,
he should arrive here about 5 o'clock.
Mf. Roosevelt is now within reach of
telephone communication, but has not
been informed of President McKinley s
death, and will not be until he arrives in
North Creek.
Banger Attends the B-ide.
The road, to be traveled, from Aiden
Lair to this place is through heavy forest
timber, and the trip will be attended by
more or less danger. The roads are very
narrow in many places, with deep ravines
on either side. A slight deviation would
mean a. broken carriage or perhaps more
serious trouble. â
Mr. Roosevelt, on his arrival here, will
at once take the special train for Albany,
arriving there about 7 a. m. At Albany
ai.cther special will be awaiting to convey
him' over the New York Central Railroad
direct to Buffalo.
ALBANY, Sept. 12.â Vice President
Roosevelt reached the camp of the Ta
hawas Club in the Adirondacks, thirty
five miles north of North Creek, at 9
o'clock. He was found on the top of
Mount Warcy. where he had gone on a
hunting expedition, by guides who had
been sent out early in the day to deliver
to him the telegram from Buffalo an
nouncing a change for the worse -in the
President's condition.
Reaches Albany This Morning.
At 9:45 o'clock to-night Superintendent
Hammond of the Delav/are and Hudson,
who has been at North Creek all day with
a special train to bring Vice President
Roosevelt to Albany, telegraphed the
train dispatcher in this city that Roose
velt could not possibly reach North Creek
before 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning.
Mr. Hammond also wired to Superin
tendent Harrington of this division of the
New Tork Central and Hudson River
Railroad, saying Mr. Roosevelt could not
possibly reach Albany before 7 or 8
S o'clock to-morrow rooming. The Dela
fware and Hudson officials who knew the

him at all times and until death
came. The other doctors were
in the room at times and they re
paired to the front room, where
the consultation had been held.
About 2 o'clock Dr. Rixey
noticed unmistakable signs of dis
solution and the members of the
family were summoned to the
bedside. Mrs. McKinley was
asleep and it was desirable not to
awaken her for the last moments
of anguish.
STAND BY BEDSIDE.
Silently and sadly the mem
bers of the family stole into the
room. They stood about the foot
and sides of the bed where the
great man's life was ebbing away.
Those in the circle were: Abner
McKinley, the President's broth
er; Mrs. Abner McKinley, Miss
Helen, the President's sister;
Mrs. Sarah Duncan, another sis
ter; Miss Mary Barber, a niece;
Miss Sarah Duncan, Lieutenant
J. F. McKinley, a nephew; Wil
liam M. Duncan, a nephew;
Charles Dawes, the" Comptroller
of the Currency; F. M. Osborne,
a cousin; Colonel Webb C.
Hayes, John A. Barber, a
nephew; Secretary George B.
Cortelyou; Colonel W. C. Brown,
the business partner of Abner
McKinley; Dr. P. M. Rixey, the
family physician^ and six nurses
and attendants.
In p.n adjoining room sat the
physicians, -including Drs. Me-
Burney, Wasdin, Park, Stockton
and Mynter.
DEATH IS ANNOUNCED.
It was now 2:05 o'clock and
the 'minutes were slipping away. ,
Only the sobs of those in the cir
cle about the President's bedside
broke the awelike silence. Five
minutes passed, then six, seven,
eight â .
Now Dr. Rixey bent forward
and then one of his hands was
raised as if in warning. The flut
tering heart ,was just going to
rest. A moment more and Dr.
Rixey straightened up and with
choking voice said:
"The President is dead." ',
Secretary * Cortelyou was the
first to turn from the stricken
circle. IJe stepped : from the
chamber to the outer hall and
then down the. stairway to the
large rcom where the members
of the Cabinet, Senators and dis
tinguished officials were assem
bled. As his tense white face ap
peared at the doorway a hush fell
upon the assemblage.
p "Gentlemen,' the President has
passed away," he said. For a
moment not a word came in re
ply. Even though the end had
been expected 'Â¦ the actual an
nouncement that Mr. McKin
ley was dead fairly stunned these
men who had been his 1 closet con
fidants and advisers. Then a
groan of anguish went up from
the assembled officials. They
cried like children. All the pent
up emotions of the last few days
were let loose. They turned
from . the room and came from
the house' with eyes.

Around the station house at 6 o'clock
it was estimated that at least 4000 people
were gathered. They were not'particu

Only two companies have been assembled
at each armory. They will not leave- their

He Was to Speak.
CHICAGO, Sept 13.-Of . the . sor- _.
rowf ul tidings from the Presi
dent's bedside. Colonel W. J. 1
Bryan said to-night: *
"I cannot believe the Presi
dent's life is to end this way. . It
seems impossible. I simply ( will not beâ,
lleve that he can die from an assassin's
bullet until I hear that he has breathed
his last. While there Is life there is
hope."
Mr. Bryan arrived here from Lincoln, -
Neb., at 8:30 o'clock and was driven at*
once to the Sherman House.
While Mr. ' Bryan was talking his head
was bowed and he appeared to be greatly
dejected. Over, and over again he re
peated the words: "I cannot believe his
life is to end this way."
"I have already spoken o*. the horror, in'
which I regard the assassin's crime," he
added, "I have already spoken of the
high personal esteem In which I held Mr.
McKinley. Â« In this moment of sorrow I
can add nothing to either." / ...
No Time for Partisanship.
Later, when the committee of the Car-,
ter if. Harrison League, at whose picnic
Mr. Bryan was to have, spoken to-mor
row, announced that the demonstration
had been abandoned, Mr. Bryan, In a
voice that shook with emotion, read the
following:
"I most cordially commend your action
In abandoning the contemplated demon
stration. We are .all oppressed by the
grief which has fallen upon the nation.
We have no spirit for a partisan meeting
at this time, for partisamship is swallo wetl
up in universal sorrow. Political contro
versies and the prizes and disappoint
ments which attend them, dwindle into
insignificance Â¦ when we stand In the pres
ence of the tragedy which seems likely to
rbb the nation of its chief executive. We
all feel the humiliation that our country
has suffered and our hearts are with the
lovely woman from whom foul and brutal
assassination is taking one of the moat
faithful and tender of husbands. Whether
the heroic struggle ends fatally or in his
restoration to health, you have acted
wisely."
Sheds Sympathetic Tears.
When Mr. Bryan ceased reading hi3 face
was exceedingly grave. He was shown
the latest bulletins, which he read care
fully with downcast head, and when he
looked up tears stood /in his eyes. In a
voice that broke he indicated the bulletin
wherein the dying President was said Â« to
be murmuring, "Nearer, My God. to
Thee." and said: . -
"Isn't that pitifulâ it's too pitiful."
"God's will be done," he read In another
bulletin, giving the President's last words
to Mrs. McKinley, and again Mr. Bryan
was deeply moved. He made no (com
ment, but again tears came streaming
from^ils eyes. He stood like one looking
on the bier of a loved one and the room
was hushed In funereal silencV â¢ â¢ . ,
It was with an effort that the Demo
cratic leader threw off the evidence of
grief and shook hands with the commit
tee, the members of which had been sym
pathetic spectators. . â¢Â¦Â¦,â¢Â¦'

BUSINESS HOUSES BE CLOSED TODAY
ON RECEIPT of the news of the President's death the following statement was made by Mayor
Phelan:
"Words fail to express my grief and sorrow at the calamity that ha befallen the nation. I
will make a suggestion to the people of this city to=morrow morning that all places of business be closed
for the day as a mark of sympathy and sorrow at the nation's loss. I will also suggest that the places
of amusement in the city also close in the afternoon and evening.
" On Monday the Board of Supervisprs meet and we will then take steps to observe a day of
mourning in the city. I cannot state now just what these plans might be, but I will favor public serv=
ices on the day of the President's funeral and such other marks of respect and sympathy as will be ap
propriate. The death of the President will be acutely felt in San Francisco, for he endeared himself to
thousands during his recent sojourn with us. The hearts of our citizens will go oujt in sympathy to the be=
reaved wife and relatives of our martyred President. JAMES D. PHELAN."

As soon as the information reached Chief
Sullivan of President McKinley's death he or
dered the bells rung. The streets were not yet
cleared of the anxious crowds that stood in
waiting, round r the bulletin 'boards hour after

fire, but after the tenth bell had struck the sor
rowing public realized its import.
Anxious Crowds Gather at Call
Offices and Wait for
Bulletins.
S~m^ AN FRANCISCO . was thrown
A^ ' into deep gloom and sorrow yes
*^S^ tcrday when her citizens learned
. ' of the critical condition of the
J^ / President.
' The early extra editions of
The CalK telling of the sudden
chsnge for the worse In the President's
condition, were the medium of carrying
the sad news to thousands of* the city's
residents, and during: the entire day all
personal and business cares gave way to
the one vital question, "Will the beloved
President live?"
In front, of the business office of The
Call In the Claus Spreckels building, hun
dreds of men, women and children gath
ered during the morning and at the lunch
hour the waiting crowd grew into' thou
sands.
From everj' quarter of the city tele
phone messages were sent to the offices
of The Call, anxiously asking as to the
President's condition.
-In business circles, in offices. In the
City Hall and Federal building, on the
streets and on the cars, the crisis in the
condition . of the President was the sole
topic of conversation.
Sadness, was depicted on the faces of
men and women and the many thousands,
who a few weeks ago gave hearty wel
come to McKinley, felt they were almost
at the bedside of the dying man.
In. front of The Call office, the bulletins
were received in grim silence. Those who
waited hour after hour for the latest
news from the East breathed silent pray
ers that, the Ruler of the Universe might
spare the nation's chief executive and
assuage the grief of the republic.
Erroneous Dispatch Causes Grief.
In the afternoon when a dispatch from
Buffalo . was received announcing the
President's death a thrill of horror went
through the entire city. Flags were set
at halfmast and many of the leading re
tail and wholesale h.ouses closed their
places of business.
Grief was turned to joy, however, when
later on the telegraphic news from the
East was that the President still lived.
At (J p. m. . the crowd in front of The
Call office was estimated at thousands
and the cable cars were blocked in their
progress, along Market street.
Considerable excitement was caused
when a scoundrel, whose name is un
known, declared in loud tones that "more
men like. McKinley should be murdered."
"Long". John Wllkins, the colored politi
cian, heard the speech of the disciple of
anarchy and asked the fellow if he meant
what he had said. "Every word of it,"
\vas the reply, as the speaker made a mo
tion to draw a pistol from his hip pocket.
Wilkins at once smashed the- man over
the bead Â¦ with a heavy cane and was ar
rested by. Officer RIley, who witnessed the
occurrence. In the excitement the de
famer of the President made his escape In
the crowd. Wilkins was charged with
Lattery but was promptly bailed out by
Attorney Horace Ford.
Anxiously Wait for Bulletins.
The crowd in front of The Call's offices
increased rapidly, and by 8 p. m. a solid
mass of humanity was closely packed to
prether at MarkeUand Third streets. The
lrequent bulletins that told of the battle
with death were eagerly read, but there
was a dread feeling that all hope had
pone v.'hen the messages told of the un
conscious state of the President. '
The dispatch announcing the arrival of
Dr. Janeway. the noted heart specialist,
at the' bedside oi the President caused the
drooping spirits of San Francisco's citi
zens to revive. Expressions were heard
on all sides in the crowd of thousands
ihat perhaps the specialist might save the
spark of life that was flickering.
Men distinguished in all walks of life
/gathered In. the various clubs and dis
cussed the latest news from the dying
President's bedside. With the deep sym
pathy expressed were also heard denun
ciations of the yellow press, that had by
vilifying the chief executive brought
from their dark lairs the cowardly band
of murderers, whose representative had
struck at a nation's heart.
_When the theaters and other places of
.amusement closed last evening many of
the audiences wended their way to The
Call's business office to learn of the con
dition of the President.
The various cable and electric cars car
ried the news of the bulletins of the Pres
ident's condition to the residents of the
outlyirii? districts. The gripmen, motor
men and conductors were asked for'in
formation at each street corner, and those
who questioned them carried the news to
their neighbors on streets adjacent to the
car lines. _.
Old Friends Express Sympathy.
At a meeting of the Old Friends the fol
lowing dispatch was sent to President Mc-
Kinley:
The "Old Friends." of which society you are
an honorary member, extends to you the sym
pathy of its members, as President of the
United States, as well as a brother of our so
ciety, in the late dastardly attempt on your
life. JUDGE CHAS. T. CONLAN, President.

ITALIAN EDITORS FIGHT
ABOUT ANARCHISTS
Ferruccio Pedretti Is Arrested for
Battery on Complaint of
Ettore Patrizi.
Ettcre Patrizi, editor of 1/ It alia, -swore
to a complaint in Judge Cabaniss' court
yesterday, charging Ferruccio Pedretti,
editor of La Voce del Popoio, with bat
tery. Pedretti was arrested by Detectives
Whittaker and McMahon and booked at
the City Prison. He was released on $50
bail.
Patrizi, in the columns of his paper, has
been denouncing the anarchists- for the
assassination of the President, and In yes
terday morning's edition accused Pedretti
of not having the courage to give utter
ance in his paper to his abhorrence of the
dastardly deed.
"This afternoon about 2 o'clock," said
Patrizi, "I was standing in front of my
office, talking to a friend, when Pedretti
walked from behind my friend and struck
me three blows on the face. I was dazed
for a moment by the unexpected attack,
and by that time Pedretti had fled."
Pedretti's story is that L'ltalia had
been constantly insinuating that he was
the friend of anarchists and he offered to
donate $500 to a charity if one word in his
paper could be shown bearing out the as
sertion, but the challenge was not accept
ed. \JVhen he passed Patrizi on the street
Pedretti says his rival editor struck at
him, but he got in the first blow. Then he
walked away.

CLEVELAND, Sept. 13â In a frame

about six years ago. ' He was employed
for a while by . the Lackawanna Coal
Company at Duryea, this county, and
whila there is said to have organized a
lodge of anarchists. He could speak sev
eral languages and soon became popular
with the foreign element. He was known
as Fred Neiman.
People who came in contact with Czol
gosz then say that he was after notoriety
all the time, and whenever the anarchists
met he Insisted on doing all the talking.
His theory was, that the condition of the
working people in this country would
never be improved until the doctrines ad
vocated by the anarchists' were put in
practice. ; â¢

Offer Song as a Prayer.
The students of the University of Cali
fornia, at a general meeting in the gym
nasium, arose this morning and sang the
first verse of "My Country, 'Tis of Thee,"
offering it as a prayer for the recovery
of the head of the nation. The verse
came . with great feeling from the .voices
of the students joined in supplication and
in hope. The verse was sung at the sug
gestion of President Wheeler, who, just
beforo dismissing the audience at- the
close of the regular address, said:
"When the. beloved head of our nation' lies at
the present crisis we can only feel our very
hearts' love Involved in the Issue. May I ask
you all to rise and sing one . verse of .. "My
Country 'Tis of Thee," offering if as a prayer
to God for the recovery of our chief executive?
THE message telling of the death
of the beloved President was. re
ceived, last night with the deepest
feelings of sorrow and grief.
The telegram announcing the
passing away of the chieftain was
received at The Call's offices at
11:20 p. m., five minutes after, the sad
event.
A large crowd was gathered in front
of the business offices of The Call and
for some minutes before the final bulletin
was posted a deathlike stillness prevaded
the assemblage. Not a sound could be
heard save the rumble of a passing car or
vehicle.
All eyes were fixed on The Call attache
who, brush In hand, was waiting to print
on the white canvas the latest news x'rom
the bedside of the dying chief. . â¢ .
A member of The Call's staff suddenly
appeared with a written telegraphic mes
sage and hundreds of men and women
watched with sorrow the printing of the
fatal, "The President is dead." Not a
word was spoken and not a comment wa3
made, as with bowed heads and blanched
faces the loyal citizens turned away from
the spot where they had waited for hours
hoping and praying for a message of
cheering . news.
Homeward they wended their way, with
hearts filled with grief over the nation's
loss, a loss that adds another name to the
glorious roll of. those who have died for
their country.

The' State Board of the Ancient Order
of Hibernians last evening passed the fol
lowing resolutions in memory of Presl-
dent McKinley:
"Whereas, The Ancient Order of Hibernians,
true to its principles and constitution, has al

The announcement of the death of the
President last night resulted In a meet
ing of the Theatrical Managers' Associa
tion for the purpose of taking some action
in the premises. It was decided to close
all theaters this afternoon and evening
As was anticipated the audiences at the
various theaters were very small last
night. The Columbia had a good advance
sale, but many of the seats paid for
during the week were not used. At the
Central a decided drop in the attendance
was observable. The Alcazar was well
filled, but Manager Thall was prepared
up to 10 o'clock to dismiss his audience
immediately on receipt of news from Buf
falo and to refund the money. The Or
pheum, ordinarily crowded to the doors
presented rows upon rows of unoccupied
seats. . â¢
The box sale of seats at all the theaters
was extremely slow and no effort was
made to force matters. The theater
goers of this city, bowed down as they
were with the grief that now shakes the
JVfart of the nation, preferred to study
the bulletins which told the story of the
tragedy of a human life cut short in its
prime, to witnessing mimetic representa
tion of any description. Where hearts
are full of grief and anxiety mirth or thÂ«
semblance of it finds no room.
At the regular meeting of San Francis

COFFEE DISEASES.
Minister and _ Young I.ady Affected.
Ministers sometimes find they suffer
from the effects of bad habits as well as
ordinary people. Rev. Mr. of Ath-
en*, N. Y., had become greatly emaciated
from coffee drinking:, which produced
etomach trouble and all of the effects of
oveVwork or poor nourishment.
He quit the coffee and began drinking
Postum Cereal Food Coffee.
His health began to Improve and he
now weighs 151 pounds, an Increase of IS
pounds over his former weight. This Im-
provement In health and strength Is
shown to be due to the use of Postum
Food Coffee, by the fact that when he
stops drinking Postumâ as he has done
for an experimentâ he begins to lose flesh
and get back Into his old condition.
A young lady who writes about the case
says that she was formerly suffering
gTeatly from "those twin diseases." dys-
pepsia and nervousness. "I knew that
both of the diseases had their origin In
the use of coffee, and while I was' fully
aware of its Injurious effects upon my
system I was not willing to give it up,
for I did not know of anything to take its
place.
"Tea, I knew, was also Injurious, and
as for cocoa. It lacked the 'snap and go'
which can alone satisfy a coffee drinker's
taste. About two years ago I purchased
my first box of Postum Food Coffee and
quit the use of coffee. I made Postum
according to directions and found I had
a drink not only equal to coffee but far
superior to It In many ways. Since that
time I have used it constantly and find
my general health very much improved
and the 'twin diseases' gone. I also send
you the names of Rev. and Mrs. of
Athens, N. Y., who have been greatly
helped by the use of Postum Food Coffee
in the" place of ordinary coffee."

THE EMBATTLED FARMERS.
rp^HE Farmers' Convention at Sacramento on
I Thursday fired a resolution that was heard
Â¦*â¢ around the State. The pressure of their neces
sities brought them together to see whether there is
any government that can save their crops from de
struction by protecting, in their lawful right to la
bor, the workmen who are willing to handle those
crops on their way to market. They appointed a
committee to begin at the beginning, at the first
point- where the law is executed, the county Sheriff
in Contra Costa. If he cannot execute the law ap
peal goes to the Governor. If that official, through
the failure of the county authorities to call on him,
cannot interfere, the farmers, thrown upon their own
resources, will repair to the shipping point and with
arms protect the transit of their property to market.
The labor leaders and the Examiner purposely
promoted the congestion of perishable property at
the point of shipment, in the expectation that it
would bring public opinion among the farmers to
the aid of the strikers. <Jn this they signally failed.
The farmers saw abundant' labor offering to handle
their property in transit, and daily witnessed the use
of force and violence to deter and intimidate that
willing labor. _ They were themselves importuned by
strikers from the city for country employment at
less wages than the country rate. They saw la
boiers from the country who took employment in the
city at ruling wages waylaid, beaten brutally and
their pockets picked by city strikers. They knew of
such laborers being seized by overwhelming numbers
of strikers and their arms broken to prevent them
working at all. They saw every pretense _of humanity
and regard for the public welfare put forward by the
strike leaders and the Examiner proved to be hol
low hypocrisy by the daily act of the pretenders.
Seeing these things and feeling the prospective
loss of millions of dollars in . perishable property,
they refused to be made the victim of the Exam
iner's desire to get nickels by posing as the friend of
striking labor, and have taken their affairs into their
flwn hands. When bad men conspire, good men com
bine. The Examiner and the strike leaders have
conspired, and the farmers have combined. We
have no doubt that they will succeed. The conges
tion at Port Costa will cease. Wheat â¢ will move.
The idle ships will load and sail away, and the farm
ers will learn the- value of doing their own think
ing and working together in their own interests.
Had this strike succeeded and had there been
established the right of the imported leaders
of labor to dictate what man's goods may go
to market and what rot in the field or on the
wharf, the next victims of their autocratic dictation
would have been the farmers, and we -would have
seen the seal of their displeasure put upon "unfair"
wheat, potatoes, melons or . peaches, and those ar
ticles left to rot on the wharf or. boycotted in the
market. '{' '
The farmers have won a victory for free labor and
free capital. [~\< : '\ ']Â¦/'. .
DEAD.
Â¦.'.'.. FT^ â "" â : : â .-: ..â¢Â¦.;',- . : ' Â¦'
THE President's death, coming close upon the bright promise of his recovery, hurts
the good' heart of the people more than if the assassin's malice had effected its
purpose immediately. In the universal sorrow there is little to be said that is
.comforting. Our people have taken pride in the peculiarly American career
of their Presidents. Washington was the owner of' a large estate, but his life was that ot
a plain man, the planter's life of his time, and aside from' his work as a civil engineer and
his military experience, his interests were with the land, the crops and the markets and
his country. ...
. -The elder and younger Adams were more nearly patrician than any others of our
Presidents. Jefferson lived upon the income of his land, and Madison and Monroe were
men of means below the average of their, time. Jackson was orphaned by the Revolution
in his childhood. His mother died by the wayside on her way from nursing the
wounded Continentals, and while in the Presidency he was concerned in the marketing of
the crops produced, and the skins of wild animals killed, on the lands around the Her
mitage. Martin Van Buren's life began among humble surroundings at Kiriderhook, and
both the Harrisons had rugged struggles in early life. Lincoln and Johnson had no her
itage but their genius. Grant began on ah Ohio farm. Garfield was a -barefoot boy on
the canal, and Cleveland had his growth upward through a weight of poverty and
privation. .'.-'Â¦'
To this class belonged William McKinley. The first necessity of his' life was self
support, and the Civil War found him a youth contributing cheerfully as a breadwinner
to the typically American family into which he was born. The tocsin stirred him to inime '-'
diate action, and he entered the ranks as a private soldier, offering his .life for that of his
country, to witness the victory of the Union as a commissioned officer. Â¦ '..['.
In*- Congress, as Governor of his State, and as President, he was always the typical
American.. On him no experience was lost. His early privations, his observations as an
industrial doctrinaire, his keen analysis of the conditions of popular prosperity, formed in
him the resolution to do his might for the industrial financial and commercial supremacy
of his country, to the end that not only should opportunity be equal and better than in
his youth, but that the means of men to grasp it should be increased. Dominated.by this
idea, his election to the Presidency made him the instrument of its realization.
He has fallen in the midst of his fruition among men. By .his fidelity his country
is the foremost nation. No empire past or present exceeded its power. He found it in
dustrially depressed and financially dependent. It mourns with his household, a nation
that, centers/within itself the power todictate to the world. â¢
The day that a wretched assassin executed upon him the malice of his detractors,
his country could boast the largest number of the best paid laborers, the most pros
perous farmers and manufacturers in the world, the most contented homes, the best fed
and best clothed people upon whom the sun shines. In all this his agency. was direct
and not intermediate. The benefactor of his country dies, murdered by a monster who
prates in justification his love of "the common people!" A typical American, the light of
the nation's life, is dead, slain by the distorted spawn of imported degeneracy, inspired by
a sentiment promoted by one who 'should- be outlawed by all races and all nations
and scorned by all men.
The nation will wipe away its tears and go forward. The great President survives
himself. The impulse his potent genius has given to the interests of the people, will con
tinue.. This is a land of law which all make, all must obey and none can assassinate. His
constitutional successor will take the great office and its great responsibilities, and hear
them like a man. % The assassin sought to murder a nation, but that nation will live with
power unimpaired.' It will fulfill 5 the high destiny devised for it by ; its stricken citizen
and chief. Its people will draw closer together. They will,- with awakened zeal, demand
that American life and energy shall be less polluted by the turbid stream that has poured
upon our shores, bringing the morbid and murderous blood that breeds. such reptiles as
this assassin. They will more quickly mark the degenerate ingrate among themselves,
whose cunning lies and false alarms misrepresent his country.. Over the white face of the
dead they will tafke s fresh oath of fidelity to freedom, to American principles, to a higher
sense of duty, and they will make this a land in which no traitor to the principles of its
people can live. * { ;
While the bells toll for^the dead and the somber emblems of mourning are
abroad, and the sun shines less brightly 'and men go softly and downcast, let no one mis
take it all for a sign of despair. It means heart-soreness and sorrow as the beginning of
a hjgh resolve that toleration- of the causes of this mighty crime has ended.
MUNICIPAL PATERNALISM.
THE convention of the political labor unionists
in this city has followed the example of the
charter makers by fefvoring municipal paternal
ism, through the public ownership and operation' of
public utilities. . â¢ \
It has been the desire of The Call to so discuss this
economic question as to permit the people who de
sire to embark this city in such business operations
to take the plunge open-eyed. We have developed
the in municipal â¢ paternalism elsewhere to a
demonstration that municipal waste exceeds corpor
ate profits in the administration of the same lines of
business. It is an interesting and suggestive fact
that wherever an effort is made to compel such pub
lic bookkeeping as- will disclose all items of expense
and income in the operation of business enterprises
under municipal ownership a determined opposition
appears, in which municipal officers and the theoret
ical advocates of such ownership â¢* appear to com
bine. â¢ '
The doctrinaires of , municipal paternalism never
lire of quoting the example of the British crown col
ony, New Zealand, which is cited as an economic
paradise and model of successful government under
highly communistic conditions. The London Times"
published last month a letter from that colony which
indicates that these -conditions are producing re
sults expected by practical men. . The Edinburgh
Scotsman, commenting on this, says that' the colony
treasury is empty and the Government is compelled
to borrow small sums at 4 per cent. Mr. -Scddon,
the New Zealand Premier, admits that. the Govern
ment lizs been unable" to make receipts equal to ex
penditures. /
A glance at the methods of that Government easily^
accounts, for this'. The 'Government is in the life
insurance business, owns the railways, and bought
great tracts of land on, which to . settle socialistic
colonies. It lias adopted a standard fate of wages
for all labor, regardless of. any natural law of supply
and demand/ It provides work for all unemployed.
The colony has borrowed a great deal of money to
carry on these experiments in 'paternalism, to' build
railroads" and furnish employment. The Scotsman
says that .all. these .public works cost double -what
they should. Nor was this , the v whole evil. ' The
money .spent in giving work to the unemployed vir
tually became a bribe for. votes for the Government.
Ministers bought the labor vote by the lavish distri
bution as % wages of the money they borrowed. It
became the policy of the Ministers to let every fad
dist carry his measure. When its futility was demon
strated it would be repealed. The compulsory arbi
tration act to settle labor disputes promoted" such
disputes and has caused a paralysis of business.
The colony is rich in natural resources, and, left
to the development of private enterprise, offers de
sirable opportunities. But the Government has re
pressed such enterprise. It has practically penalized
the private} ownership of land, and in the endeavor
to create a socialist heaven has made an industrial
hell.
Fortunately, these experiments in the United
States have been confined to cities and on a less
comprehensive scale. But they are no "more suc
cessful. The latest failure is that of public owner
ship of. the natural gas' plant in Toledo, Ohio. To
ledo is dominated by that primate of -socialism and
fads, "Golden Rule Jones," who has been its Mayor
for many, years.- Ten years ago that city issued a
million dollars in bonds to create a public gas plant.
Its cost of administration gradually increased until
the burden became unbearable to the taxpayers, and
it has been leased to a private corporation at an' an
nual rental of $6500. The interest charge on the
debt is $47,250, and the taxpayers have to make up
the difference between that and Jhe rental. The plant
had deteriorated, and the taxpayers were unwilling
to stand the cost of repairing the ravages of neglect
and bad management."
The Toledo Bee, commenting on the affair, says:
"Incidentally many- of the men who shouted loudest
for the public' gas plant got their start in life' through
their connection with its administration, and having
become taxpayers managed to, bob up in time to urge
the Council to lease it to a\ private corporation, so
as to save their taxes." J Â¦-.

to learn just how 'many Boers are going to accept his
invitation- to- come in and -be- good before 'Septem-
HOW BETTING PRICES RANGED
IN LAST CUP YACHT RACES
The Columbia Which Is Again to Defend the Cup Was a
Strong Favorite Two Years Ago.
JN view of the near approach of the international yacht races for the Ameri
ca's cup, every one interested in the big contests, especially those who will
soon be making wagers on the outcome, will beÂ«glad to know how the bet
ting on-"the cup races in 1899 stood. It was strongly in favor of the Colum
bia, the early odds generally standing at 2 to 1. The form shown by the
Shamrock I In her trial spin changed the odds materially. Some of the largest
wagers were as follows:
Captain Lawrence, a friend of Lord Dunraven, bet $2500 to J200O on the
Shamrock I with Riley Grannan.
A prominent New York club member bet $1000 even on the Columbia.
"Tom" O'Rourke bet $1000 to $S00 on the Columbia.
Thomas Lee bet $400 to $500 on the Shamrock I.
Leo Swatts bet $600 to $1000 on the Shamrock I with a syndicate.

of imprisonment. Therefore, the de
vices employed by some deserters are as
ingenious as they are exciting* although
they cannot be said to be always crowned
with success. - For sheer audacity the
case of an Irish soldier who deserted in a
south coast town in England some years
ago would be hard to beat. Just at that
time, a number of desertions had occurred
in the â¢ neighborhood and the authorities
were therefore unusually sharp to prevent
further offenses of this nature. But the
man in question was dissatisfied with sol
diering and having, a number of friends in
the town who were disposed to help him,
and being possessed of an unusually large
modicum of pluck, resolved to delay his
return to civil life no longer. One morn
ing early he slipped out of the barracks
and made his way to a friend's house
without being seen. Arriving there he
shaved off his mustache, and, donning a
policeman's uniform, boldly promenaded
the main streets of the town. He was,
of course, missed in the barracks and
knew that the* 'surrounding country was
being scoured In the hope of finding him.
j On one occasion his sergeant came up to
him and asked him if he had seen or
heard anything of the missing man, and
he, of course, replied that he had not," but
he would keep his eyes open! . For inore
than a fortnight he preserved his dis
guise without it being penetrated even by
the police themselves, and he then calm
ly left the town when the hue and cry had
subsided somewhat. Nevertheless, his en
terprise came to naught, for he was ar
rested in trying to work his passage back
to Ireland.
Scarcely less audacious was the ruse
employed by another dissatisfied son ot
Mars, and in this case, likewise, it proved
futile. He happened to know that a cer
tain publican in the town was In anything
but affluent circumstances, for he visited
the house regularly, and from remarks
dropped at odd times discovered that the
publican was heavily in debt to a Scotch
spirit merchant. > One morning, as soon
as the publican opened his doors, the sol
dier arrived, after having first disguised
himself with a beard and wig and donned
civilian attire. With him came a friend,
who agreed to act as -a. representative of
the law,; and he promptly told the aston
ished publican that he had orders to leave
a man in possession unless 'the sum owing
to tie Scotch spirit merchant was paid to
him there and then. The publican, of
course, could not pay, so the deserter was
quartered upon him and lived in his house
and at his expense for more than a week
before the deception was discovered. Per
haps the most successful deserterâ for a
time â was William Conrad. Through one
of his comrades he heard of a man whose
son had gone to Australia gold mining,
and had, apparently, disappeared, for
nothing more had been heard of him.
though the parent still believed he would
see him again. Conrad therefore hit upon
the ingenious idea of leaving the army by
stealth, and, going to the man, informing
him that he was. the missing son. As his
knowledge of Australia was considerable,
he lost no time In putting his plant into
execution, and the parent, believing in
him, despite the supposed alteration In
his appearance, provided him with a home
and money galore, a commodity he con
fessed he lacked. But unfortunately for
him, at the end of eighteen months the
real son turned up, and what followed
can better be Imagined than described;

IMMENSE OREGON LOG RAFT MISSING
SINCE IT LEFT THE COLUMBIA RIVER
Vessels From North Report No Sign of Tugs or Their Tow, Which Went to
Sea Over a Week Agoâ Shipping Men Think They Have Been Driven
Past the Port During the Recent Northwester That Raged on the Coast
AMERICAN SHIP JOHN ENA, NOW LOADING BARLEY AT OAKLAND LONG WHARF FOR NEW YORK. SHE
ARRIVED FROM AUSTRALIA WITH A COAL CARGO LAST MONTH. CAPTAIN MADSEN IS IN COMMAND
OF THE VESSEL. . '
SHIPPING men are wondering what
has become of the big log raft
that left the Columbia River on
the 6th inst. It was in tow of the
Puget Sound tugs Tatoosh and
Richard Holyoke. Since passing out over
the bar nothing has been heard of either
the raft or tugs. None of the coasters
have reported wreckage and the general
supposition is that the tugs and their tow
have been compelled to run past this port
in the recent northwester. One of the
colliers left here for Puget Sound early
in the week and after bucking tho gale
for several days had to put back short of
coal. If the log raft ran into the same
kind of weather the chances are it will
next be heard from coming from the
south.

NATIVES PERISH
BY THOUSANDS
Dreadful Mortality in
the Indian Tribes
of Alaska.
Â»
Famine Aids the Ravages of
a Disease Resembling
Cholera.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Sept. 13. â The ravages of the
epidemic of disease among the Indians on
the Lower Yukon last summer was awful.
The mortality reported from Catholic mis
sions Is greater than In any other pre
vious year. Old natives were chiefly the
victims.
Rev. Father Rene has just returned to
Dawson from a trip to Nome and Teller.
He says that thousands of Indians died
lu the area spreading from Nulato down
to St Michael, southward to the Kuskok
wim and northward toward Bering Strait.
Many In the Lower Yukon basin were vic
tims. The epidemic was a sort of cholera
that ran among the natives alone. Father
Rene says It is believed to have been
brought over In some way from the Sibe
rian coast. The shortage of fish and other
food among the natives did a great deal
to spread the plague by rendering the In
dians first - impoverished as to strength
and unable to withstand the disease.
A very strange report is brought by
Father Rene as to the origin of the In
dians, of America. He says that it has
beeen ascertained by the missionaries at
Nulato and those in Arizona and New
Mexico that the Indians of those two wide
ly remote quarters speak the same identi
cal language. The report seems scarcely
credible, but comes from the father direct
as given him by priests under his charge
at Nulato, who have mastered the Nulato
language and who have been correspond
ing with the fathers among the Apaches.
The headquarters of Father Rene are. in
Juneau. He will proceed from Dawson to
Seattle to endeavor to raise fund3 for the
establishment of a Catholic hospital in
Nome. He established a Catholic church
in Nome only a few weeks ago and left a
priest in charge, and soon will have an
assistant sent there.
Minook Swept by Fire.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 13.â The steam
er Cottage City, which arrived here short
ly after midnight, brought news that the
town of Little Minook, on the Lower Yu
kon, has been swept by fire 'and all the
cabins and much valuable property de
stroyed. Forest fires were the cause. -

New York Stock Market. Â¦
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â The news of the Pres
ident's relapse fell upon the stock market with
almost greater force than did that of the first
attack upon him. The measure of this effect
Is seen in the result and prices as a rule fell
to-day below the level of last Saturday. The
laborious course of restoration of prices during
the week had carried the averaze well back
to that ruling at the close of last Friday, be
fore the news of the shooting was known in
Wall street. A false report of the President's
death had circulated in London to-day and the
panicky selling from that center was thrown
upon the opening market here. The condition
of the money market and eome of the develop
ments of yesterday left the market vulnerable
even to a more natural course of events Dis
appointment over yesterday's dividend action
on M. Paul was keen and heavy selling of that
stock was inevitable In any event. Amalga
mated Copper also continued under special pres
sure, owing to assertions that enormous stocks
of copper were being accumulated and that thÂ»
maintenance of tlie nrice of the product was
becoming difficult. Republic Steel was actually
affected by the comments on its. poor showing
of earnings for the year. The amount of offer
ings of Government bonds brought out by Sec
retary Gage's proposal was disappointing the
t0 . t i 1 JÂ£ a Â£Â£ ln & only about tf.500.000. compared
with $20,000,000 invited, but payments mad"
for these were in cash unon uresentatlon at
the sub-treasiiry to-day most of the offered
bonds being sold in New York. The apprecia
tion of this situation was seen in the prompt
offerings of bonds at the sub-treasury, the pay-
ments on this account for the day 'reaching
about $ 3, 000, 000. or practically the whole amount
mvcivea in the settlement of the purchase.
ihe critical condition of the money market
during the past week has apparently brought
some relief to the drain on i\ew iTorK 'reserves
and the cash losses are estimated to be no
greater than ?2,5ia),(aK>. This does not include
to-tlay's large gain from the sub-treasury. The
loan item is a matter of mere guess work, but
the tree lending of money eany in the week
to ke*p down the money rate must be reckoned
with, as wen as the liquidation which has been
effected. Call loans went to ltÂ» per cent to
day, but relacsed to 6 per cent. No extraor
dinary measures were deemed necessary by the
clearing-house committee, and in fact that body
was not In session durinsthe day.
Kailroad bonds were weak, but not acutely
as stocks. Total sales. $3,850,000.

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day was dominated by
the alarming bulletins regarding the condition
of President McKinley. American stocks
opened from 2 to 3 points under j parity. , The
more- leassurins news caused a slieht im
provement at the end of the flrit hour on the
theory that there was an opportunity to buy
stocks cheap. There was a sharp rally of from
1 to 3 points on the New York opening. Then
followed renewed selling, but . the movement

PLAN REVOLT
FROM RANKS
Union Men Hold Further
Caucuses and Talk
of; Break.
Â¦Â¦ â ?
Effort Among Them to Get a
Hundred Men to Return !
- to "Work.
Brotherhood Quadruples Its Picket
Force in *\frliolesale District
and Close Watch Is Kept
on Members. .
The movement among dissatisfied teams
ters to return to work gathered momen
tum yesterday when, at caucuses on Bush
street', it was decided as soon as 100 union
men had pledged themselves a break
would be made Monday morning.
Some seventy-five men. agreed on Thurs
day to go to work yesterday, but the
prompt interference of Michael Casey,
business agent of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters, together with the appearance
of a quadrupled guard of pickets in the
downtown district, prevented the consum
mation of the plan. The men say-they
are not dismayed, however, and that they
will carry out their intention on Monday,
be the cost to themselves what it may.
Tho only circumstance which prevents
an open break among the teamsters is
the lear of violence" at the hands of the
strikers or sympathizers. This waÂ« the
subject of discussion between Manager
Renner of the Draymen's Association and
a few of the striking teamsters yesterday.
Manager Renner made the following
statement yesterday:
The report has been industriously circulated
among the striking teamsters that the prom
ises made by the Draymen's Association that
waeen and houra will not be changed if - the
men tro back to work will be broken and ths
drivers will bo ground down to the lowest
notch. I wlffh to make the explicit statement
for myself as member of the nrm of Stetson-
Kenner Drayase Company and for all the
members of ,the Draymen's Association that
the wages and hours of all teamsters In the
fuuire, no matter In what way the present
strike is settled, will bo the same as those In
existence at the tlmo the strike was Inaugu
rated, an established by the agreement be
tween the Draymen's Association and the
Hrotherhood of Teamsters October 1, 1900, with
the exception of Sunday and holiday work. On
these daya drivers taking out teams until 12
o'clock noon or any time before that shall get
a full day's pay, and teams kept out all day
time and a half. I wish It to be distinctly
understood that all benefits to drivers will be
the tame whether they are members of unions
or not.
Leading draymen assert that the action
of the brotherhood in increasing- the pick
ets is a positive indication that a break
is feared and that strenuous efforts will
be made to prevent such a culmination of
the strike if possible. The belief is .gen
eral, that the end of the teamsters' strike
is now close at hand and that by Mon
day,. a' decided stampedo will have taken
place.
ATTACK AN ENGLISH RATTER.
British Consul May Appeal for Fed
- eral Protection.
An attack made on a sailor, a Brit'sh
subject, one of the crew of a British ship,
yesterday afternoon will probably be
mdde the basis of an appeal by ,tho Brit
ish Consul to the Federal authorities fur
protection from violence at the hands of
strikers.
Charles Lindsay, an able seaman -be
longing to the British ship Haddon Hall,
was attacked about G o'clock In the after
noon by a mob of union sailors. After
being chased for several blocks he took
refugo In the Seamen's Institute, where
he remained until a policeman arrived
from the harbor station. Sergeant Blank
later escorted aim to his ship. Lindsay
was on his way- up town when attacked.
A number of men approached .him and
ankr-d:
"You belong to the Haddon Hall?"
"Yes, I do."
."And you're working cargo. Take that!"
Ltindxay dodged the blow but in dodging
stopped another one. J'.Iowh mined from
Â«vcry Hide but Iwforo they could pursue*
tho usual tacticsâ knock him down ami
rob himâ he Jumped clear of tho crowd
ntnl took to hla heels with tho mob after
him.
When tho Haddon Hall first came along
side Howard-street wharf tho men called
on tho British Consul for advice au to
whether tho articles they had Â«ignec!
mado it compulsory for them to work the
cargo. They wcro told that their con
tract was to that effect and tfiat any vio
lation of the articles' would be puniqhed
with imprisonment. The men went back
to the ship and have faithfully fulfilled
their contract.
The local Sailors' Union has arrogated
to itself in this ca3e the right to Jay down
the law in regard to protection of labor
ers. When notified of the decision of the
British Consul ths union pickets were
given orders by their officers not to inter
fere with or use violence toward the
crews of British ships, whether they
worked cargo or not. Â¦â¢Â¦
Lindsay, who is colored and a British
subject, declares that the matter has not
ended; that his contract with his em
ployers compeis him to work cargo, and
that as a 'British subject he is entitled to
walk the streets of an American port
without being exposed to murderous at
tack at the hands of American citizens.
As several of the officers of British ships
have been attacked and a number of
others threatened it is more than likely
that the Lindsay case will be brought to
the attention of the Federal authorities
through the British Consul.

HONORS OF FIGHT EVE1T.
Sailors From British. Ship Australian
, , - " Stand Off Strikers.
C. Peters and AL , Wester oerg, 'sailors
belonging to the British ship Australian,
were attacked yesterday morning by a
crowd of strikers. -The strikers greatly
outnumbered the sailors, but, although
the limejuicers both went to the Harbor
Hospital, they were followed shortly by
Ernest French and H. Lauf of the at
tacking party. Some sixteen scalp wounds
were impartially distributed among the
quartet, which was helped to the hospital
in sections by Policemen Edner and Mc-
Gowan. Dr. Digglns attended to the in
juries.
A truck belonging to the J. B. Bocarde
Drayage Company, laden with glassware,
was intercepted- by a gang of strikers at
Twenty-fourth and -Mission .streets at 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon. The driver
and special policeman deserted the team
and fled.' -Word was 'sent to the Seven
teenth-street police station and f- Officers
Winters and Martin were dispatched to
the place. The officers found. the traces
cut and the nuts taken off the wagon.

HEBREWS USHER
IN A NEW YEAR
Hold Special Services in
the Synagogues of
the City.
Rabbi Nieto Bids, the People
Hope for the Vindica
tion of Truth.
The Hebrew New Tear was ushered In.
at sundown last evening with special ser
vices in the synagogues. According to the
calendar it was the beginning of the first
day of the seventh, month of the Hebrew
sacred year and the beginning of the civil
year 5662. The occasion Is observed as a
sacred festival and all work Is prohibited.
To-day Is set apart for the work of self
examination and preparation for the Day
of Atonement, which comes ten days later.
During the days preceding thÂ© first of
the new year It Is customary to visit the
graves of friends and relatives and give
charity. The distinguishing feature of the
days is the blowing of ram's horn, or Sho
far. The ram's horn In ancient times
seems to have been blown at times of
national danger, or when It became neces
sary to alarm the. inhabitants of a city
or to arouse them, to defense when at
tacked. At the present day It is said the
blowing of the ram's horn signifies the
arousing of man to a knowledge of his de
pendence upon God and his need for pre
paring to defend himself against evil and
to. Justify 'his conduct for the past year
at the tribunal of his own conscience.
After the evening services of last night
and until the eve of the Day of Atone
ment it is customary for friends to greet
each other with, the words, "Mayst thou
be inscribed in the book of life," it being
a part of the Jewish belief that the per
fectly good are Immediately ' Inscribed.
They often add to this greeting the words
"Immediately" to show their appreciation
for the friend's character as a man.
In all of the synagogues services were
held, so as to greet the new year at the
proper season, which is at sunset. '

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 13.â The swel

th.= percentage of the book to melt
a bit, the watermelon man grew
wealthy in fifteen minutes and the
<iÂ»wds surrounding the bars resembled
ir.e New'. York Stock Exchange when
NcTthern Pacific touched the limit. Many
cf the kvJies' costumes looked like sea

aot accent; above mediocrity." Inasmuch
.as the spo.-t was commonplace, it seemed
remarkable that five of the fa.vorites had

ioiing three winners.
It wsis quite a profitable afternoon for
Jrving-' Mulholland, the Inyo horseman.
He captured the special 2:14 trot with
Osito and the 2:12 class pace with Edna
H. Osito sold a mild favorite in the. pools,
and the only other starter to furnish an
argument wj-j; Alta Vela. The last named

pacing numier. Jn each heat exoept the
inird Edna R nearly lost the other side
wheelers. This one she dropped to Gaff
Topsail and then cane out in the fourth
and made the latter look as if his topsail
had been blown to shreds.
After many trials and tribulations old
Toribio linaliy earned a pair of brackets,
besting a very ordinary field in the first
six-furlong- sprint. He closed a 4 to 5 fa
vorite, with Hoar up, and . after shaking
off Phlegon beat that horse easily at the
iinish. Burlingajne landed Howard in tha
show.

Huachuca, reached the wire half a length
before- Torso Maid. The 1 to 2 favorite
Tyranus lost the snow to Fred Atterbury
by a rose.
The mile selling affair resulted in a hol
low victory for ex-Joc-key Johnny Web
er's old mare Lizzella. She had J. "Ransch
on her back and, played heavily at odds
of 3 to 5. won all the way. Mike Rice, the
second choice, took the place quite as
tasily from Ringmaster.
3urns & Waterhouse's gelding Rollick
proved no match for Caesar Young's fast
Jilly Eonic in the sixth event, a six-fur
long selling run. The filly enjoyed a pro
nounced call in the betting, although the
stable sent in a commission on Rollick.
Hoar laid away with the favorite until
the stretch was reached, where he' took
the lead and she came home on the bit.
Rollick disposed of Gusto for place hon
ors.
An outsider. Gold Baron, against which
10 to 1 was laid, took the final ftve-furlong
dash In a drive from the two favorites,
Catherine Bravo and Galene. Swiftwater
led to the stretch and there gave up to
Catherine Bravo. The last few strides
Howson closed fast on the outside witli
the outsider, getting the decision by a
head, with only a neck separating the two
choices.

Jimmie Whalen proved too much for the
Senators yesterday afternoon at Recrea
tion grounds, and as a. consequence three
scattering hits and one lone mark on the
score board were all that were made off
his puzzling delivery. On the other hand,
the German aggregation fell on Hoffer's
shoots to the extent of three runs and
three times as many safe bumps. The
contest was decidedly a pitchers' battle
up to the seventh round, when the Dutch
began to land on Hoffer. When the shout
ing was all over Hoffer's delivery was
found to have been damaged to the extent
of four clean swr.ts and three tallies. The
Capital City slugg-ers could do absolutely
nothing with "Chimmie der Whale,'.' one
man only making the round trip.
Uncle Hank's men began to do business
in the seventh. Captain Pabst opened
with a hit, went 'to second on Krug's out
and came home on Shay's clean single,
Shay taking second on the throw. By
means of two more hits and a Â¦ pretty
double steal another pair of pretzel shoot,
ers ambled home, which made, the score
board stand 3 to 1, remaining so untllÂ«the
end.
I McLaughlln reached first on Jimmie's
wild throw in the sixth, was moved up to
third on Sheehan's hit and bounded across
the rubber on Courtney's out to Shay and
Pabst. i â¢ '
The Senators played *a perfect fielding
game but lacked the hitting power. The
Wasps, on the other hand, made a few
niisplays. but managed to come in con
tact with the sphere at the right moment.

Notes of the Game.
Tim Flood, Sacramento's new inflelder.. ha*
not arrived, but is expected in time to play In
some of the games of the present series. He Is
said to be a fast fielder.
Devereaux did not make a single assist in
yesterday's contest, a singular occurrence for
a shortstop. ' 1.
Wilson seems to be:spins back on his. stick
record. In the last two games he has not made
a single hit. :.-..,
The Sacramento players (rive too much back
talk from the bench. It should not be allowed.
The easiest way of putting an end to It is to
have Rube Levy fine a few of them, and then
perhaps they would at least make an attempt
to behave themselves.
"Chlmmie der Whale" surprised himself and
everybody else yesterday by hitting out a three
bagger to left. He did not stop even then, but
later on made a single. "Chlmmie" bids fair
to become a second Lajole.
Los Angeles has a large delegation of crack
Eastern players en route to the City of Sun
fhlne. It begins to look as though a few of
the present sluggers will soon be looking for
jobs. .
Devereaux. HUdebrand and McGucken â¢ each
made a startling catch in yesterday's game.
Shay and Reilly executed a pretty double
steal'in the seventh, the former coming home
and the latter reaching the middle cushion.
Ashenbach and Stricklett were put In to bat
in place of Hanlon and McGucken in the ninth
round, but neither made. good.

DUBOSE MAKES
HIS DEFENSE
Denies That He Advised
His , Clients to; Dis
j obey the Writs.
His Statements Are Flatly
Contradicted by Fink
and Knight.
The rehearing granted Dudley Dubose by
the United States Circuit Court of Appeals
was taken up yesterday by United States
Commissioner Heaccck, . E.- S. PiKsbury
appearing a3 amicus curiae and Garret
McEnerney as counsel for Dubose. Du
bCEe was found gulityof c:ntempt of court
several weeks ago and sentenced to six
months' imprisonment in the Alameda
County Jail for having advised his clients
in the celebrated Nome mining litigation
to disobey a writ of siipersedeas issued by
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals^in this city. ...
In the rehearing yesterday Attorney
Pillsbury established the fact that con
tempt of court had been committed-, al
though Dubose sought to show that he
had not directly advised disobedience,- but
had made efforts to prevent the writs
from being enforced.
Dubose was the first witness placed on
the stand. He was asked by .McEnerney:
"Did you ever advise or order your cli
ents to disobey any writ issued out of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals?"
"No. sir.!' was the reply. â¢ ; ,
"You had nothing to 00 with that what
ever?"
"No, sir."
"At the meeting with Major Van Ars
dale did you state that you had advised
your clients to disobey that writ, and
would continue to do so?"
"No. sir."
"Had you any arrangement with any
persoi* whatever to obstruct, interfere
with, disobey -or refuse to comply with
any order issued by this court in any ot
this Nome litigation?"
"No, sir."
Pillsbury declined to cross-examine the
witness. . â¢ â¢
Damaging Testimony Against Duboso
Damaging testimony contradicting that
of Dubose was given by Alfred Fink, a
lawyer doing business in Nome. He nar
rated that the writs of supersedeas
reached Nome September 14, 190u. and on
the afternoon of the next day the attor
neys for both sides appeared before Major
Van Arsdalc. The attorneys for McKenzie
requested him not to assist the defend
ants in enforcing the writs of. superse
deas by helping them to take possession
of a_large quantity of gold dust that was
stored in the bank vaults and was in pos
session of Receiver McKenzie. Messrs.
Metson. Knight and Johnson argued that
the writs were valid, and Dubose. Beam
er and Geary contended that the writs
were void. Receiver McKenzie- had de
clined to obey the writs, and the question
was whether/ or not they were able to be
protected by Major Van Arsdale and the
military in their disobedience.
Dubose stated at that meeting that lie
had advised his clients not to obey the
writs, t and that he would continue to ad
vise ' them so. because he regarded Â¦ the
writs as altogether void.
Knight Corroborates Witness Fink.
Samuel Knight, attorney at law, cor
roborated the testimony of Fink as to the
ndmlssions made. by Dubose on the occa
sion of the conference at Major Van Ars
dale's room. On that occasion Dubose
said: "If you want my opinion, I have ad
vised my clients to disobey the writs."
Dubose being recalled went on to ex
plain what he had said and meant at the
conference spoken of.
"I did not advise McKenzie to disobey
the order of the court." added Dubose,
"because McKerzie had discharged me as
his attorney a month before. I told Fink
that I had advised Chipps that the writs
were void. I never' advised my clients to
disobey the writs. Chipps said to me on
the street. 'Judge, the Swedes have-got us
on the run.' and I said to Ghipps. 'That's
all right; that matter will be argued be
fore the Circuit Court of Appeals in Seat
tle on the 10th of this month.' "
The transcript of the testimony and pro
ceedings will be forwarded to-day to the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals at
Seattle. > .
RAMSAY NAMED
FOR THE PLACE
Successor to Howison on
the Schley Court of
, Inquiry.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 13.â Rear Ad
miral Francis Munroe Ramsay, retired,
was to-day ordered to. duty as a member
of the court of inquiry which is investi
gating the conduct of Rear Admiral
Schley during the war with Spain. Unlike
Rear Admiral Howison, whom he suc
ceeds, Rear Admiral Ramsay ha*s never,
so far as known, publicly â¢ or privately
commented upon Rear Admiral Schley's
behavior and the latter regards him as
entirely acceptable. 'â¢Â¦' :< Â¦
It developed to-day that the Navy De
partment had anticipated that Admiral
Dewey and Rear Admiral Benhaih would
sustain the challenge of Rear Admiral
Howison and two days ago began to con
sider who should be ordered to fill the
vacancy. The decision was finally ma.de
in favor of Rear. Admiral Ramsay, in the
first place because he Is. the choice of
Secretary Long, and, second, because- of
his known fairness and judgment.
Rear Admiral Ramsay, who will succeed
Rear Admiral Â¦ Howison, .was born, in the
District of Columbia on April 5, 1833. He
is in excellent health/mentally and physi
cally. He entered the navy. on October 5,
1S50. He served in various positions, in
accordance with his rank, until 1881, when
as a special mark of tha department's ap
preciation of his services he was appoint
ed superintendent of the Naval Academy.
When he had â¢ completed , his term of
duty at Annapolis he was given command
of the Boston, and upon his relief from
that vessel was appointed Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, which position he
held until his retirement. He was placed
on the retired list in .1897. In religion,
Admiral Ramsay is a Catholic, and this
fact has given rise to reports that he
would ..be . antagonistic to Schley. â¢Â¦ . The
acceptance of Rear Admiral. Ramsay by
the latter effectually disposes, of - these
reports.- . â¢â¢Â¦ . - ; ." . v :iC '.\.

COOPER'S FIRST
VICTIM HERE
Bertha Young Will Tes
tify Against the
Swindler.
Intends to Give Her Aid in
the Effort to Convict
â¢4 the Rogue.
. Â« â :
THE luck of "Sir" Harry Westwood
Cooper, alias Ernest Moore Chad
wick and a score - of other
equally high-sounding names, has
changed. "Sir" Harry now stands
but little chance of escaping a long term
in jail.
Miss Bertha Young, the famous swind
ler's second wife, is in town and ready to
take the stand in the interest of the State
and testify that Cooper knowingly com
mitted bigamy when he married the
pretty little Crockett girl, Norine Schnei
der. .This evidence will sweep away the
objection "that was made at the swindler's
former trial, to the effect that his latest
victim could . not testify against him be
cause she was his wife.
Miss Bertha Young was married to
Cooper in June, 1896, at her home in Bris
bane, Queensland, Australia. Miss Young
is the unfortunate young woman whom
the bigamist deserted in Toronto when he
eloped with Ida Maud Campaign. Miss
Campaign was with Â¦ Cooper in this city
when he was convicted and sent to San
yuentin. Miss Young, so far as is known,
was the first victim of the swindling big
amist. She Is a tall, pretty girl, . witn soit
brown eyes and dimpled cheeks. The
story she tells of. how Cooper wooed and
won her is, in many particulars, like the
sad experience of Norine Schneider. When
Cooper met Miss Young he was posing
as a poor physician at Brisbane, little
by little he built round himself a tale in
which he figured as a hero who had fallen
heir to an English estate that grew grad
ually from Â£2000 to Â£18,000. Alter Cooper
married Miss* Young he managed to bor
row Â£400 from her aunt in Melbourne. and
then went with his bride and her little
brother to England and then to Toronto,
where he deserte,d them. !
Miss Young and her mother have been
making their home in Buffalo, N. Y., and
it is owing to the efforts of ex-Chief Lees
that they came out here to testify against
Cooper. , â¢
Cooper's second trial on the charge of
sending a forged telegram to Miss Norine
Schneider will commence before a jury in
Judge Lawlor's court Monday, and Miss
Young' and her 'mother will be called as
witnesses to prove his marriage to her.
It is also likely 'that the Grand Jury will
be asked to bring an indictment against
Cooper on the charge of bigamy.
SHAFFER BUSY
SEEKING PEACE
PITTSBURG, Sept. 13.-The absence of
President Shaffer from Amalgamated
headquarters was noted this morning and
when the day passed and he did not ap
pear the report that he was in New York
was received from several sources. The
officials of the organization declined to
discuss the strike in~any form and said
that they did not know where Shaffer was.
It was learned to-night that President
Shaffer, with several of his advisers, took
the 10 p. m. train for New York, pre
sumably under, an arrangement with the
steel people to settle the strike. It can
not be said positively that this is the case
but all indications point to it.
The indications early in the day were
that a settlement of the strike was looked
for by the Amalgamated men. This be
lief was strengthened by the current issue
of the Amalgamated Journal, which told
of President Shaffer's renewed efforts for
negotiations. His reported trip to New
York is believed to.be the consummation
of these efforts. Until the result is known
no developments are expected in the
strike situation.
JOLIET. 111.. Sept. 13.â Although not
sanctioned by a joint session of the
lodges the steel strike in Joliet is at an
end. An order from President Shaffer is
on the way declaring the strike here off.
The order will not reach here until late
to-night or early to-morrow and the/men
will hold one more joint meeting to-mor
row morning to ratify the action of Presi
dent Shaffer. The mill started at 2 o'clock
this afternoon and many of the strikers
have already returned to work.
Ground to Death. Under Train Wheels
Willie Cook, 13 years of age, son of
Ernest Cook, a" tinsmith living at 7 Aztec
street, was ground to . pieces under\a
Southern Pacific freight train last night
at Valencia and Twenty-fifth streets
Pieces of his body were found scattered
along the track for over a block. An
elder brother recognized the clothing after
the remains had been taken to the
Morgue.
KILLED BY A TRAIN.â A man supposed to
be B. Mollnarl, a Journeyman baker, was
killed last evening in an attempt to board a
train near Baden. From letters found in his
pockets the railroad officials concluded that
he was Molinari. , ; .
SUPREME CUT
AGAINST BOUND
The Supreme Court yesterday decided
that John Farnham and not Patrick Bo
land was legally entitled to the office of
Public Administrator of San Francisco.
The court did not directly order Boland's
immediate removal from office, but de
creed a new trial, with the suggestion that
judgment be given to Farnham.
Farnham's contention, which is sus
tained, is that enough of the ballots cast
for Boland were marked in such a way as
to identify the voters. . Section. 1215 of the.
Political Code says: "No voter shall place
any mark upon his ballot by which it may
be afterwards identified as the one voted
by him." Boland was elected by a ma
jority of 203 votes. Under the law, the Su
preme Court finds that more than this
number must be discarded in the count. .
Farnham objects to five classes of bal
lots, and four of them are declared illegal.
In certain ballots there is found a cross
in squares opposite which there are no
candidates' names. The court holds that
such marks may identify the voter. There
are other ballots where a cross is found
on the lines dividing two squares. Such
ballots, the court holds, should not be
counted. A third class of ballots contains
two crosses after the names of certain
candidates. Identification is again, in this
case, thought to be possible. Again, two
crosses appear in the squares. The court
says that the law orders one cross and
when two appear the vote is illegal.
Farnham also attempts to have votes
cast out where the stubs are not detached,
but the court says that in such cases the
voter is not responsible, but the, persons
who prepared the ballot3. '
The decision of the court was considera
bly accelerated in the case on the ground
that an election is in the nature of a sum
mary proceeding and should be disposed
of with the least possible delay.
Justice Garoutte, Â¦who gives the decis
ion, and with whom Justices Harrison and
Van Dyke concur, instead of ordering Bo
land to retire in favor of Farnham, turns
the case back to the Superior Court again.
His remarks to this effect are as follows: -
In the many recent election contests that
have been presented here by appeal it appears
to have been the rule without exception to re
turn the cause to the trial court for further
hearing when the Judgment has been reversed,
and we will not depart from that practice In
this case./ At the same time, in so dolnsr, the
action of the court must not be construed as
establishing a precedent which will be fol
lowed in every case of this character brought
here on appeal. Â¦ For the foregoing reasons the
Judgment is reversed and the cause remanded..
Boland assumed the duties of the office
of Public Administrator in January. 1900,
and his term would have expired
next January.. Attorney Hassett, his
legal adviser, ' states that the case
will be fought to the end. Â¦
