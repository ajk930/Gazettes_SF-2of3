Hypnotism exists and has always done

influence of the Hindoo fakir o\'er the

same principle as the experiments of a
Paracelsus or a Charcotâ viz., the elimina

The evil that could be done with the
aid of hypnotism Is practically unllmlte-i
and the good eo very limited that on the
whole it should better be frowned upon
by all, including the medical profession.
I have never tried to hypnotize any one,
though I have seen something of It. It is
not to be depended on and there Is very
little to recommend it.
Its use is so limited, almost entirely to
hysterical patients, and it might assist in
nervous trouble. It has no curative qual
ities, and I do not think it has made much
progress or headway.
I do not favor hypnotism. It is a bad
agent in the hands of unprincipled per
sons, and I think the majority of physi
cians in good standing disapprove of It.
I know there are some good physicians
Â¦who favor its use, but they are the ex
ception that prove the rule to the con
trary.
Hypnotism! Why, I really never tried
it, and have not even seen much of it, so
my opinion on It would not amount to
anything. Of course, there Is such a
thing, but I always feel like classing it
with the work of mediums and clairvoy
ants. It is so associated In my mind,
though some physicians approve of it. I
do not think the majority favor it. Hys
terical patients are about the only class
benefited by it.

outside of such it is of little use. For
genuine sickness or ailments, such as con

I favor hypnotism to,sqme extent, .but

COLONEL JAMES BOWIE AND HIS KNIFE THAT NEVER "MISSED FIRE"
present The fight began with pistols. One
of. Bowie's missed fire, while both of
Wright's bullets took effect upon his an
tagonist. ,'
Thinking he had Bowie at his mercy,
Norrisl;W right sprang upon him. 'In. a
moment Bowie had drawn his deadly
knife, and though two or three of Wright's
friends were shooting a\, him and hitting
him, too, Bowie made one awful slash at
Wright's neck. The keen steel hit" Into
the very neck bone. The blood shot. out
over Bowie, and Norris .Wright was dead
before : he touched the' ground.
Seriously wounded himself, it was for
some time ." a very doubtful question
whether or, not he would 'ever get well.
But youth, a temperate life; and an excel
lent Â¦ constitution finally brought him
around, and in a year from that 'time he
killed General Craln with the same knife
he had. used in -his first encounter.^ "The
knife doesn't miss fire," he said to an inti
mate friend, : Mr. Bynum of. the parish of

tracts of land that had been grants made
by the French crown. When Louisiana,
was ceded to the United States and fin
ally became a State there was a good deal
of trouble on this account over some of
the titles to land along Red River and its
tributaries. A man often had to fight for
his plantation, as frequently he would net
give it up to somebody with an old French
or Spanish' grant It was^ in these con- .
tests that James Bowie did the most of
his kilUns. He had sixteen lives on- his
hands from the use of that one bloody
knife. After much consideration he had
made a knife that has been the model and
pattern for all the real bowie knives that
ever had the sanction of their originator.
In 1835 Colonel Bowie sold his Louisiana
property and went to Texas. The Lone
Star State was in the throes of a bloody
revolution. The gallant resistance of the
â¢Texans so exasperated General Santa
Â¦ Ana,. who was chief in command of the
Mexican forces, that he swore he would
take no more prisoners. When Bowie ar
rived in Texas and 'offered his services
to the young republic, he was at once
made Â¦ a 'colonel of riflemen in the army
of Texas. \ .."
Â¦ ' ' ' Â¦.â¢ V â¢
In January, 1S36, Colonel Bowie was or
dered to San Antonio de Bexar to- assi>t
in holding that place against Santa Ana's
coming 1 forces. The siege ran along until
March, when San Antonio, trusting in the
pledged word of honor of Santa Ana. with
a starved-out garrison, surrendered. A
general massacre took place. Travis,
Crockett and Bowie were murdered In
cold blood, a stain on General Santa- Ana's
memory that time can never blot out.
Colonel Bowie was badly wounded three
times, and was in a room of the main
work of the place called the Alamo. He
opposed the surrender as long as was pos
sible. â¢ .
He was lying on his bed when he heard
the triumphant Mexicans coming In. It
was the first hint he had had of the sur
render. He knew his life was ended. He
could, however, move about a little. The
instant the Mexicans came into the room
they began shooting at him.' He grasped
his knife and leaped among them like an
enraged tiger. And when the firing ended
six of his enemies had crossed the, Styx
with James Bowie and gone with him to
the shades.
The knife was fitted with' a wooden scab
bard, covered with leather* and was sharp
enough to shave the hair off the back of
one's hand. ' This was the original bowlo

subsequently in shape. ', 'Bowie, : whll6 a

to rely upon a knife he-had caused to be
made for' just such a contingency.. He
had taken a 14-inch long file, such as was
then used to sharpen crosscut saws and
the upright saws used for 'turning out
planks from logs. He had the file marks
carefully ground . off \ the file and the
smooth piece of steel skillfully . reduced
by the grindstone until it was about the
thickness and weight he desired. Then
he took it to a Spaniard in New Orleans
known as "Pedro, the skilled cutler," a
man who had learned his art In Toledo,
where the finest sword blades in all Spain
were forged. He tempered and finished
the knife, fitted it with a crosspiece and
haft. When it was done James Bowie had
a weapon "fit to fight for a man's life
with," as he said to Governor Wells.; It
was beautifully balanced, and the artist
had hollow-ground it like a razor, with a
double edge for three or four inches from
the point.

And so he was much* better equipped for
the deadly fight that was so near at hand.

many respects the greatest was James
Bowie, famous only by reason of the
v/orld-renowned knife called by his name.
A few words touching his ancestry may
not be out of place. He was not from
Maryland, as has been stated, but was
born In Burke County, Ga., in 17D0. In 1802
his father emigrated to Louisiana. .
That country was then still under
French domination. There had been large
tracts of land granted by 'the French
crown in the territory named for Louis
XIV. and one of these, in the parish of
Catahoula. was acquired by the elder
B,owie. He was a man of substance, own
ing nearly 100 slaves. He soon had his
estate -well opened out and was growing
superb crops of cotton and corn. His ; sori
Jame3 he sent first to a- famous private
school at Natchez, Miss., and afterward
to the Jesuit college, then located in New
Orleans.

BIRDS THAT BIND
THEIR OWN
WOUNDS.
YOU are not accustomed to think
of birds as surgeons, but It Is true
that the woodcock, the partridge
and some other birds are able to
dress their wounds with consider
able skill. A French naturalist says that
on several occasions he has killed wood
cccks that were when shot convalescing
from wounds previously received. In
every instance he found the old Injury
neatly dressed with down, plucked from,
the stem of feathers, and skillfully ar
ranged over the wound, evidently by the
long beak of the bird. In some Instances
a solid plaster was thus formed and In
others ligatures had been applied to
wounded or broken limbs.
One day he killed a bird that evidently
had been severely wounded at some reÂ»
cent period. The wound was covered and
piotected by a sort of network of feath
ers, which had been plucked by the bird
from its own body and so arranged as to
fcrro a plaster completely covering: and
protecting the wounded surface. It had
evidently acted as hemostatic in the first
place and subsequently as a shield cover
ing the wound. The feathers were fairly
netted together, passing alternately under
and above each other, and forming a
textile fabric of great protective power.
Birds are often found whose limbs have
been broken by shot, with the fractured
ends neatly joined and ligated. AT.
Dumonteil tells of a woodcock that had
been shot by a sportsman on the after
noon of a certain day. After a long
search the bird was given up, but It was
discovered the next morning by an acci
dent. In the meantime the wounded legs
were found to* be neatly ligated, an ex
quisitely neat blindage having been placed
around each wounded limb. The poor
bird, however, had. in dressing Its wound,
entangled its beak with some long soft
feathers and had It not been discovered
It would have died of starvation.
A HUMAN CALENDAR
FOR LAST HALF
CENTURY.
fTy? 1S-TEAR-OLD boy of Bloomington.
/Z-A\ Ind., carries in his mind a per
11 Â» manent calendar for at least the
last half-century, although by
many of the citizens he Is considered men
tally deficient.
To everybody in Bloomington and
around the quarries he is known as the
"weasel." "When asked his real name he
gives any of a half-dozen which he has
at his tongue's end for the purpose of sat
isfying the curiosity of the questioner.
So far as known the boy has never at-
Itnded school and knows nothing about
the system by which past and future
dates are calculated. When -asked on
what day of the week a date twenty
years back carae. the "weasel" answers
the question correctly within the space of
cne minute and often in much less time.
He gathers up many nickels and pennies
by telling commercial travelers " at the
hotels on what day of the week they were
born. The day of the month on which one
â¢was born is given the boy and he imme
diately supplies the day of the week. To
the Questioner this is in many cases
knewn, so that it is at once known that
the boy has given a correct answer.
Every ruse has been made use of to mud
dle him in his calculations, but in each
case he gets the best of the undertaking.
The other day he was asked on what day
of the month would come the seconJ
Tuesday after the first Monday of a
month of a year In advance. His answer
ccme in forty seconds and it was found
to be correct.
Nobody in Bloomington claims to know
the secret of the "weasel's" method of
calculating dates. When ask': I a date he
raises his hand to his mout'i, mumMes
something through* his thin lips, and
works the finders of one hand.
The Bushmen, or low-grade Hottentots,

to be a close approximation to that of
the higher apes. It consists of hissing,
clicking and grunting sounds.
laying the side of the face 'fiat on the sur
face of the water, so that it just reaches
the side of the mouth, keeping the.head in
exactly the same position in relation to
the body as when walking, taking care
not to move it up or down. ' The body and
head should be kept rigid and the arms
and legs used as propellers.
. Supposing the pupil to be lying on his "
right side, his first movement is to place
the left hand as far advanced as possi
ble, the thumb being tightened over the
forefinger .to form a kind of scoop to en
able the swimmer in the next movement
to get a good "grip" of the water, the
right hand being held at the breast and
the legs opened as wide as possible. -This
is movement No. 1... The next movement, '
No. : 2, is to bring the ; left hand
pact the breast,' getting~a* good -hold of the
water in so doing, throwing the. hand back
to its full extent, the right arm being shot,
straight forward, palm downward. Take
great care not to allow any part to come
iut of tbe water, but to be iust beneath
water, and the movements of arms and
legs are for propulsion only. Â¦
The most common fault with beginners
is their anxiety to keep their heads too
much out of water, which necessitates
great effortsâ efforts which Bhould be di
rected to propelling the body along. The
lower your head is in the water the bet
ter; just keep it sufficiently above the wa
ter to breathe.
Before entering the water practice
drawing the hands up to the breast, palms
downward and thumbs together, with the
lower arms and elbows close to the sides.
Next shoot out the arms well in front of
the breast, as if trying to touch something
out of reach, taking care to stiffen the
joints. Then turn the palms outward and
take a circular sweepwith both arms un
til they are square "with the shoulder.
These three movements constitute a stroke
and should be performed in one continu
ous motion. . â¢'
As for your legs, you won't -have to
Â¦worry about them. In all my experience
I have found that the legg fall in line
naturally when the arms have learned
their duty. You need not teach them to
kick; they will do it automatically. For
you know swimming is almost natural to
you, anyway. Your cousins, the other
animals, swim by instinct. If Darwin is
true, probably you used to do the same.
Now that you have practiced the stroke
on dry land so that you have the idea of
it a little, you are ready to try the water.
Obtain a small rope about twenty-five
or thirty feet long, make a running knot
in it and let your friend place this around
your waist with the knot in the center
of the body in front, so as to balance you
nicely; then haul the rope in while you
make the stroke at the same time. Enter
the water with a resolve to make three
long steady strokes and increase the num
ber as progress is made. I lay great
stress on the steadiness of the stroke, as
all beginners seem to be possessed with
the idea that they can only keep up by a
succession of quick, jerky strokes, which
only have the effect of jerking the head
out of the water at f one moment and im
mersing it the next, besides quickly ex
hausting . the learner's strength. Great
care should, be taken to keep both hands
and feet, when taking a stroke, under
the surface of the water. The inhaling of
the breath should be done at the moment
when the arms are being shot forward
from the breast.
After you make yourself thoroughly ac
quainted with the breast stroke, you
should learn to float. Some people learn
this before swimming. Place yourself on
your back, throw, your head back, your
chest well out, straighten your limbs and
you will float with the lightness of a cork.
Be careful not to throw the head up after
getting into position.
When commencing to learn the side
stroke, turn the body over on the side.
Many lives would be saved if people
could keep a cool head and place them
selves in floating position when a ship Is
wrecked. People who could not swim
have often floated for hours, waiting for
succor.
THINK of it â you way learn to swim
by yourself. It is almost as easy as
hanging your clothes on a hickory
limb and not groins near the w^ter.
It is somewhat wetter but very
easy.
As far as hanging your clothes on a
hickory limb goes, that is exactly the
same proposition. The only difference is
that you have to go near the water.
The things to provide yourself with are
a bathing suitâ the simpler the better
plenty of water, a rope and a devoted and
patient friend. Now go ahead.
In the first place put yourself In the
right spirit cf confidence by remembering
that of all outdoor pastimes, swimming is
the most easily learned, especially swim
ming in salt water. In learning the first
necessity is to fully understand that It is
our natural buoyancy that keeps the hu
man body afloat, since the specific gravity
of the human body is less than that of
the surface. As the left arm Is pulled
back the legs are brought sharply to
gether, the swimmer taking care to use
the 'flat part of his feet as much as pos
sible for propellers.
The side stroke Is, of course, very dif
ficult to learn, but once you have mas
tered It you will employ the stroke con
siderably and pronounce it easy, graceful
and pleasant.
Now, in the overhand stroke the head
sinks lower than in other styles of swim
ming and the feeling Is not so agreeable.
Presuming you are on your right side,
the only difference between this and the
ordinary side stroke is that the left arm
Is thrown forward above the surface of
the water to . Its utmost extent. Then
placing it In the water, a strong, powerful
pull is taken, letting the arm go back to
its full length. The exertion is much more
severe than for the common side stroke.
Try to consider swimming as a sport for
your own benefit. Never mind other peo-
By this time you are a good swimmer.
Not by the time that you have read to the
bottom of this page, but by the time that
you have implicitly followed these direc

I'll tell you what I think about them. I

AN EASY METHOD OF LEARNING
TO SWIM
2The Indian, left Kaskaskia. For almost
a year nothing was heard of him, and
Benard thought that his daughter had
forgotten her lover, for she ' appeared
gay and careless, and she accepted < with
apparent pleasure the 'attentions 'of a
young Frenchman. One night -y when" a
large ball at Kaskaskia was at Its height
But love always finds a way, and the
young couple managed to see each other
despite all the precautions of the girl's
father. Benard became aware of
these meetings and again took .means to
prevent them. He was a man of wealth
and influence, and he had the Indian
forced out of the partnership in the trad
ing' company. ',
The girl was at once fascinated by the
tall, . fine . looking Indian, who fell in. love
with ber at first sight and made no secret
of his, admiration. But' Benard pere soon
noticed the attachment and forbade his
daughter from communication -with the
young Indian. To make sure that : there
would be no more meetings Benard used
his influence to prevent the chief from at
tending an/, of the social entertainments
given in Kaskaskia. ,
A young chief of the'Kaskaskia tribe of
Indians, having become converted to
Christianity, after several years of study
undsr the tutelage of the Jesuits, built
himself a house in Kaskaskia and was
taken into partnership in one of the trad
ing houses there. He was prosperous,
handsome and well educated and was soon
received Into the homes of the wihte set
tlers. One night at a ball he happened to
meet Maria Benard.
Jean Benard came to this country from
France in 169S, bringing with him his wife
and Ills 10-year-old daughter, Marie. The
family settled in Kaskaskia, where Be
nard established a merchandising business.
The Frenchman soon became one of the
most 'prosperous and most influential men
of the town. Marie, his daughter, grew
to be a beautiful woman, 'much courted by
the most eligible young men of the new
country. "
land where the town once stood has nn
ally disappeared. According to the people
who knew ! the story, it had taken two
hundred yours for the curse to act..
Beneath our .feet are forms equally
weird, the bottom blazing with light at
every step. j Hera are: phosphorescent
crabs, and seafans that emit golden* green
and lilac hues. ' Blue scintillations come
from seapens, while others give out
gleams of gold and green. Almost every
animal is a light-giver. Some of the craba
are phosphorescent over the entire sur-.
face; others have their lights on stalked
eyes, while the very mud that rises seems
to scintillate with light that would appear
to be an essential feature of the deep sea. -
We might in this walk of Jhe imagination
descend to a depth of six miles beneath
the sea and still find life. ,
In all probability the largest and most
remarkable fishes have not been seen, and
escape the dredge. Many of these strange
forms of the abysmal depths are types of
A WHOLE town destroyed- by * a
wronged man's curse. Such, â¢ de
clare the people who once lived
there, is the fate which has finally
overtaken Kaskaskia, the old town which
was tee first capital of ; Illinois.
| Kaskaskia was situated on a peninsula
at the. Junction â¢ of the- Kaskaskia and
Mississippi rivers, and In 1882 the Missis
sippi . cut its way through \ the peninsula,
leaving the, remnant of the town on ah
island. The water continued- to wash
away the rich alluvial deposits on which
Kaskaskia was built until, during - the
winter just -passed, the last' foot of the
surface, each one emitting a vivid, lilae
colored light.
Above this forest of living lights strange
and weird fishes are passing, which we
recognize as forms that have been dredgfl
from great depths by the Albatross, Chal
lenger and others. . One, the Chiasmodun,
dashes by emitting light from its own
bedy. and wonder of wonders, we see it
seize a fish live times Its own bulk i.nd
draw itself over it like a glove. Its Jaws
by a special arrangement separate, and
the mouth is a cavern- of India-rubber
like possibilities. A similar fish, mala
ccsteus.is of a rich black velvet hue, and
as it poises we see Upon , its head two
large lights. One emits a golden light;
the other throws out fitful green rays,
which have some hidden meaning in the
company of nature. Some of the fishes
seem to be literal mouths. Such is the
Eurypharynx or pelican fish. The mouth
is enormous, the bones of the jaw being 1
attached to the skull by movable joints,
so that It has enormous powers of dis
tension, i!
A curious black fish called Echlostoma
has Its lanterns arranged about its head:
two are just below the eyes, while there
are several others at various portions of
the head. At a depth of two miles we
find the fish Bythites, and at three miles
we shall find others more remarkable. A
hideous snakelike creature is' Stomias,
with pointed teeth and a row of lights
along its ventral surface like the lights
that are seen in a dark night in the car
window as the train dashes along. This
fish has been taken from a mile and a
quarter beneath the surface by an Eng
lish dredger. .
In descending into the intermediate
depths, the jelly-fishes and forms that
live in the open water attract our atten-/
tlon. Here is a jelly-fish, its disk six feet
across, its train of tentacles possibly emit
ting a vivid light and stretching away in
a maze of brilliant lines for. perhaps, one
hundred feet. Such is the Cyanea. one of
about this dimension being seen by Mrs.
Agapsiz off Nahant. Such a. jelly-fish,
moving through the upper depths, might
well be compared to a great comet.
Other forms â huge disksâ are the moons
and lesser planets of this submarine
world of space. The variety of tints and
colors* emitted, by the jelly-fishes is al
most beyond comprehension, and so- di
verse are the lights that the belief is

. low light. Idyia emits a roseate hue,
while the light of Aurella is of such a bril
liant yellow that when one of the animals
was squeezed into a glass of milk the
latter was rendered so luminous that a
letter was read by it.
From these instances, and they are but
a few in many, it is evident, that the
stroller through the ocean, either in the
moderate depths at night of the abysmal
realms of day, would not wander about
blindly, but would have his pathway
illuminated by lights effective, and bril
liant, rendering the deepest ocean a region
the opposite of the conditions of stygian
darkness that it Is erroneously supposed to
hold.

THE TOWN
DESTROYED BY
A CURSE.
Assuming that we are walking on tho
ocean bottom at the depth of over a mile,
we move cautiously along In water Icy
cold, and suddenly are confronted with a
blaze of light, and find ourselves in a field
of light-givers. Imagine a cornfield with
stalks from two to four, feet in height,
tho tips gleaming with light and .waving
gently to and fro. Such an appearance
the fields of umbellulana present. Off St.
Vincent the Challenger dredged In a fioid
of light-giving gorgonias wlth v stems about
two feet long. The trawl came up choked
with them from a region a mile below the
Descending into deeper depth we still
find life. Many of the fishes are blind;
nearly all have phosphorescent lights, and
their shapes and forms are strange and
uncanny. Sunlight does not reach below
1000 fathoms: beyond this no plant life
exists, and the various forms of life prey
upon one another. Among the deep sea
fishes especially there Is constants war-
The rainstorm is the falling of these
countless shells to the bottom. They are
ever dying; the animal Is destroyed, and
the, little shell sinks, piling up at the
bottom and forming . the well-known
globigerina ooze. The increasing weight
grinds up the lower stratum into an im
palpable powder and slowly piles up the
bottom, forming a mass which, if
elevated above the surface, would re
semble the chalk cliffs of Dover, which
were formed at the bottom of the ocean
In much the same way:
ture. Everywhere there is life. Kvery
drop of water is alive; and standing In
this strange region, at a depth of a mile
or so we find ourselves in a rainstorm
beneath the sea. All about are count
less objects dropping upon us. Invisible to
the eye, but so result-producing In the
aggregate that the raindrops pile and
heap up in such masses that with those
th6t die on the bottom they round off
the tops of submarine hills and moun
tains, fill up the valleys, and the thick
gelatinous ooze through which we have
walked with so much difficulty Is the
visible result of the rain. In brief, we
are in the region of the globigerina oozeâ
a condition found In great depths, but
not always In the greatest: It has been
estimated that if lime-secreting organ
isms are as numerous down to a depth of
600 feet as they are near the surface
there would be more than sixteen tons of

In the uppermost 100 fathoms of every
square mile of ocean.
extinct forms, and we only imagine what
wonders the deep sea hides. In the At
lantic and Pacific gigantic squids from
fifty to seventy feet in length are found,
and glimpses of strange snake or cell
like sharks are suggestive of the uncaught
mysteries and unseen dwellers in the deep
eea. Among the curious light-givers Is a
Fhark which was caught by Dr. Bennett,
It was perfectly black, but emitted a
strange phosphorescent light which ) re
mained some time after the animal's
death. The shark was placed in a Jar In
the cabin of the vessel, and is described
as presenting a ghostly appearance, emit
ting a rich green light almost sufficient to
read by.
I have often read of boys who awake at
sunrise and bound/ out of bed with a sin
gle leap, and ha,Ve always thought that
such sudden awakening could be true only
in books. But that was exactly how thl3
shark woke. It fairly leaped out of a
sound sleep and jerked the skiff ahead so
violently that the box seat upset and I
fell backward upon my companions. This
upset was certainly not a dignified begin
ning, and I heard a roar of laughter from,
some fun-loving lookerson.
The shark, now feeling; the rope, dashed
along at a rapid pace, making It ex
tremely difficult for us to retain our
places; but my companions aided me.
Carefully raising me, they righted the
box. I secured Â¦ the painter and held thÂ©
single rein in triumph. It was a signal
success. We had harnessed the shark and
were moving at a rate that was wildly
exciting. The speed was so great that tha
boat was pulled almost bow under, and a
wave of foam preceded us.
One of my companions paddled gently
and the flat-bottomed boat slowly drifted
on. Leaning forward, I picked up ths
float and quickly ran the painter through
a hole thar had been left in the float for
the purpose, and fastened it with a bow
line knot. "When thls^was done I hauled
in the slack and gently pulled tha rein,
while one of ihe boys "clucked" at the
shark and the other said "Gedap!" No
response. Then I gave another jerk at
the line and the shark woke up.
Presently we saw the float lying mo
tionless on the water near the wall. The
shark was undoubtedly asleep, little sus
pecting the rude awakening that was in
store for him. I now handed the paddle
to one of the boys behind me and took in
hand our painter, the rope fastened to the
boat, and it was now my business to se
cure this to the float and to arouse tha
shark. . $'C-
Finally the day arrived, and very early,
while the great tropical sun was creeping
up through the vermllllon clouds, we
made our way around the wall and to our
marine carriage. Being the originator of
the scheme, the privilege of the box seat
was awarded to me. Literally, this seat
was a boxâ a discarded cracker box. My
two companions sat upon a board In the
stern to balance the skiff. "We were soon
in place.' and sitting on the box I care
fully paddled the little craft out from the
tide gate and began the search for our
steed. I paddled down one side of the
great wall, keeping perfectly quiet, as
every quick movement threatened us with
a capsize.
For some time we had been building: a
boat which was to be the carriage of thl3
steed. The. masons had given to us the
frame of a great brick arch upon which
they were working. This resembled a
scow with squaro ends. It was a perfect
eklff, except that the planks were an Inch
apart; but we filled these crevices and
calked It with oakum. The day before the
shark was caught the boat was launched
and tested, and It was found that It would
hold three boys, two on a lower seat and
one on the box seat of the coach. The
"shark ride" was looked forward to with

fitted over the head and was tightened
Just behind' the fins, so that it remained
in place, a perfect saddle girth. To this
a rope about ten feet long was attached,
and in turn made fast to a float. All this
was prepared in advance, and It did not
require much time to attach it. though
the plunges of the shark knocked several
men from their feet. Finally all was
ready and the shark was rolled over into
the moat, where It went dashing away,
the telltale float following at the surface.

Strange animals inhabit this region,
and â¢ the deeper we go the more remark

or so they fairly compel our admiration.

Along the shore are schools of porpoises,

show a singular change. Many of the
fish are of gay. colors, and could we

be popping from its head when it arrived
from the sudden change.
To make the ocean bed a reality I will
ask the reader to imagine that he is equip
ped with a diver's armor capable of re
sisting pressure and accompany me into
the deep sea. As we descend Into the blue
depths we realize that we have entered
another world, where to all Intents and

Immediately the light fades, so that when

concerned.
If the ocean bed. which is popularly sup
posed to occupy three-fourths of the

thrown up by volcanic action into moun

the changes of the land with which we are
familiar, and in a measure resembles it.
The deep sea. while forbidding and un
inviting, has Its inhabitants that are well

Marie Benard disappeared.
Those who searched for Marie discov
ered that the young chief of the Kaskas
kians had been seen that evening in the
town, and the conclusion was at oneÂ©
reached that the girl had eloped with him.
Benard at once organized a party to go
in pursuit of the fugitives. As there was
a heavy, snow on the ground, their trail
was easily discovered and followed. The
Indian and Marie had crept away afoot,,
and' as their pursuers were supplied with
fast horses the young lovers were cap

miles from Kaskaskia. Their destination,
had been the French settlement at St.

Benard took the Indian to the bank of
the Mississippi and, binding him tightly
to a log, turned him adrift in the liver.
As -. the helpless Indian floated away to
his death, he raised his eyes to heaven
and cursed Benard, who, he declared,

SOME CALIFORNIA
BUTTERFLIES"Highways and Byways of Music", is by
Hugh A. Clarke, musical- director of the
University of Pannsylvania..- This, book, a
companion volume to , "Music and the
Comrade Arts," is a series of six essays
on the history of music as an art, with its
development along that line from the days
of myths down to- the present composers.
In no sense is the book biographical, but
it deals with the trend, the motif, of the
musical art. 1iv:vvv; :
; In ,the. essay 'on "Myths", the universal
ity of - certain striking coincidences is
pointed out and- argues for the great an
tiquity of the art. ; "Literary Men and
Music" is a plea for the fuller recognition
on the part of literary men of music as a
â¢'great art." Professor Clarke sets forth
the theory, that the, \'folk song" is simply
an indication cf racial temperament, out
of | which "art music" may grow, ' arid that
the German branch alone of the . Teutonic
family-was possessed of the requisite tem
peramental conditions for this growthMn
"Modern Tendencies" the author has at
tempted to* strike . a balance ; between .the
losses and gains i of the art since the first
quarter of the century just ended.', -.

WARREN CHENEY.
THE latest addition to tha fast- growing group of California authors
is Warren Cheney, who has just published a collection of poeina
under the title "The Flight of Helen and Other Poems." Like, sev
eral, writers in 'whom California has centered her hopes of becoming as
prominent in the field of literature as by the efforts of others she has
already been made in the domain of art. Mr. Cheney, although a native
of New York, received his training in letters at the "University of Califor
nia.' He had the good fortune to be there when Edward Rowland Sill was
doing so much by his teaching to incite in his pupils a love for all that
is "best in literature and, whon he was producing examples of .literary ex
cellence ! which for a long time have proved an inspiration to young
writers. /
Although this is Mr. Cheney^s first book, it does not represent the
results, of his, first efforts as a writer. He-was at one time J associate
editor of the Overland Monthly and at another editor of the Mining and
Scientific Press. Besides, he lias at various times contributed to maga
zines verses and short stories. ', \
All of the poems in the book are short. They are dainty and mu
sical, and have the charm which comes from the felicitous expression of
a beautiful thought. Â¦ .
The following poems reveal well the main â¢ characteristics of Mr,
Cheney's work: .- :

"With sodden drift and the red mold;

â¢^TvP SECOND volume of short stories
// \\ by Jack London is on the market
/' \under the title of tbe first tale in the
*'book-"The God of His Fathers,"
Last year before the appearance of Lon
don's first book he was practically un
known in the field of letters. It was only
when his short stories had made hits in
various magazines and then were gathered
together under the title of "The Sons of
the Wolf that people began to realize
that this Oakland boy possessed a genius
peculiarly his own. Now his life has been
printed so often and his praises sung so
loudly that every one is familiar with his
history and certainly every reader who
reads at all has read one or more of his
stories of the "Frozen XCorth" and the
"'Great "White Silence."
That firpt collection of short stories of
last year was sp'endid. "The God of His
Fathers'* is not so good.
Xow let it not be misunderstood that
his tales of this season are lacking in
meritâ quite 4 _he contraryâ but. in com
parison with" the spontaneous outburst of
last yeaT. they seem a. little bit "written
to order."*
This year there seems to be an effort
cn London's part to affect the marvelous
and out of tbe ordinary â last year there
was rc.".fc. Elill, it must be said that in
its own line of virile tales of this stranara
Jand "Ths Gad cf His Fathers'* stands
far and aiiead of any of its competitors â
excepting, of course, LÂ«ndon's own work.
"The Sons.nf the Wolf."
It mar possibly be that. Mr. London's
r.ext work ' wIH either "make or break"
him. The reading public is a fickle jad^ 1 .
Â£he i?ooti decides that 'â¢'enough of a good
thing is enough/* and now that London's
Klondike stories have gone up close to
the two dozen mark she may net praise
a third effort if it is simply more short
stories from the ICorth.
Of coxiTse this great country is a vast
and comparatively virgin field and there
is plenty of cliance for volumes upon
voVanK-s of good copy to come out of it.
but or?? of London's etories is very much,
like anotherâ^good cf course â but one
even tires of beefsteak for steady diet.
He possesses undoubted and natural
genins for short Etory writing. He gets
his effects naturally and without effort,
liut he seems lacking in versatility. "When

Mr. Mowry tells us that his book was
not born, but that, like "Topsy," it grew.
He has spent his time for the last twen
ty-five year*? in collecting material for Itâ
in fact, ever since he first learned cf the
heroic labors and the tragic death of the
man who saved Oregon for the United
Statesâ Dr. Marcus Whitman. His list of

"I have visited Oregon, Washington ana

Mr.- Mowry expressly I states ; that; hl3
work is a history. and jiot an "embellished,
story." " He writes .with the purpose . of
showing what he firmly believes that all
honor is due. to "the a memory of that
Christian patriot, tkat heroic missionary,
Marcus "Whitman,"., who braved all " the
cold and snows of the Rocky Mountains
to cross the continent and warn our Gov
ernment of 'the advance i of an English
colony of eighty persons from the"; Red
River region. "Whitman set the truth be
fore , President Tyler, and in June, ; 1843,
led a caravan of two hundred wagons and'
nine hundred ; people back to the new
country. This was the first marking:., out
of the Oregon, trail over which, so many
companies of emigrants were '.to pass.
Whitman's final death at the hands of the
Indians : gives a very tragic ending to a
romantic Â¦ life. .
We have read records of remarkable his
torical rides, but that ride of Marcus
Whitman to save a State for the Unionâ
a ride of over four thousand miles . In
midwinterâ would seem to put all others
to shame.
Mr. Mowry has treated his subject
thoroughly and his book deserves a place
of Its own with the best historical, ac
counts of early Oregon. (Published by

A Series of Uatxire Books.
The Appletona have published a note
worthy series of nature books this year.
First came/F. M. Chapman's "Bird Life,"
which was reviewed at some length in a
past Issue of The CalL Mr. .Chapman i3
recognized as an authority onthe subject
all over the United States. The other
volumes of the series are" "Insect Life,"
by Professor J. H. Comstock; "Familiar
Trees," by F. Schuyler Mathews, and
also Mr. Mathew's ""Familiar Flowers."
All of these books ara illustrated pro
fusely with excellent half-tone reproduc
tions, as âell as many colored platÂ«3.
Professor John Henry Comstock is
professor or entomology in Cornell Uni
versity and his book certainly deserves
a. Srst place among popular guides to the
study and identification of insect life. The
twelve full-page plates reproducing but
terflies and insects in their natural colors
are remarkably well done. These wood
engravings were made by Anna. Botsford
Conastock, member : of the Society of
American "Wood Engravers. _Y*: ;
"Familiar Trees and Their Leaves"
also has twelve pictures of representative
tress in colors and la addition there are
over 200 drawings from nature by. the au
thor.' Mr. Mathews, besides treating his
subject in a popular vein, gives the
botanical Â¦name and habitant of each tree
ajid a record of the precise character and
color of its leafage. Nature lovers can
not fail, to appreciate the conscientious
work . evidently expended' in bringing this
book to It3 present state of completeness.
No small part. of this series is the ad
mirable manner of illustration. Just to

Jan -was evidently a heavyweight lifter,
for they had to pry his teeth open with
a. Jnftchei. All of irtiieb reflects further
credit on Mr. Taylor, for he goes right
on with the fight after merely politely
expressing his relic?.
Even -with a. -wooden finger It is con
clraively shown that Taylor was a friend
.out of the ordinary, that he could sins
the praises of "Mistah Gordon, as brave
ami honorable a gentleman as ever hit the
trail aftah the dogs," even -while the fight
Â¦was on. :0-W~% ' Â¦"-
Personally I think that Mr. Taylor must
have had a wooden finder and that Jan
got his mouth full of splinters for his
trouble.
. â¢Thank yon, suh; it is a powerful relief."
Anl Sir. Taylor proceeded to gather into his
arms ths victim's wildly waving legs.
'Xemme get the hatchet to him!" vociferated
tbe sailor. "Lemme get the hatchet!" He
shoved the f!pÂ«1 edge close to Mr. Taylor's
finger and used the man's teeth as a fulcrum.
Jan held cn and breathed through his no3e,
melting like a grampus. "Steady, all! Kow
she takes it!"
"I' yen will allow me, Ulstah Lawson, be
foah we eo further in this rumpus, I would say
it wall a good idea to pry this hyer varmint's
teeth apart. Neither will he bite off, nor will
he Jet go. He has the wisdom of the sar
pint. suh. the wisdom of the sarpint."
"Stand by Jpr stays." As Lawson gave the
warning, Jan half lifted himself and the strug
gling quartet floundered across the tent into
a muddle of furs and blankets. In Its passage
it cleared th<? body of a man who lay motion
less, bleeding from a bullet wound In the
neefc.
"Steady, all!" Lawsoin the . sallorrnan,
bawled. "Jam his head Into the bean pot and
batten down."
".But my fing-ah, suh," ilr. Taylor protest

"But I car.'t, Mirtah Lawson. It's In the
critter's gullet, and nigh chevr-d o~ as "Us."
But Jan kept his grip on the third man's
finger and squirmed ever tha floor of the tent,
into the pots and nqr.s.
"Touah no Kentl?man. suh," reproved Mr.
Taylor, his body foHowfns his finger, and en
deavoring to accommodate, itself to every jerk
of Jan's head. "You hÂ»v killed Mistah Gor

I will give a part of what the Man with

a verdict to any one who has a finger of
his own. If you are lacking in the ex

Now Mr. London does not say, but pos-
Fibiy this finger is a wooden one and the
Southerner is merely anxious lest the
paint pet scratched off it. If so, all
well and good. But if this finger Is mere

the words that London puts in the mouth
of the man with his finger in the other
man's mouth show that the author could
not have heard as well as he saw. That
is a ml'd way of putting it.
There is one point in "Jan, the Unre
pentant," that is either deeply hidden
humor or worse. Mr. London opens his
story with the fight in full blast. Three
men are endeavoring to overpower Jan.
One of these men, a "real Southern gen

one that will set the studies of the logi

that logic is of practical utility and not
merely a purely formal science concerned
with the* form and not with the thought
expressed. He claims that. logic does deal
with the matter as well as with the form
of thought and its expression; dnd that
it embraces, in its scope everything that
relates to the right use of words. He as
serts, further, that logic is the very foun

Mr. George M. Drum, the blind man
who keeps the "Little White Stand" for
the pale of newspapers, etc., in front Oi
Hale Bros.', on Market street, has gone
into literature* on his own account. In
hia announcement he says that the pres

Btory and a few verses, Is to be the first
of a series of travels In a wonderful sub
marine boat described in this tale. This
first story Is called "The Bottomless Lako
and Mysteries of the Haunted Cavern."
Mr. Drum la to be complimented both up
on "his grit in not giving way' to his un-~
fortunate affliction and also upon the ex
cellence of this fantastical bit of story

these men the poems have a peculiar zest,
but even deprived of this they can still
well afford to stand upon their own mer

Although they were not then known as
the work of Field, their authorship would
now be plain to the many lovers of -the
genial poet's verse. They are filled with
his versatile spirit. This volume will make
a very acceptable addition to two volumes

overlapping our quarter, a gruff voice
hailed, "What yacht is that?" > .

that did him credit, answered, "Fleur de

"That can't be her," I' heard some one

"Madge," I said, "do you know the

We kept them waiting at the Vicarage.
"How long you have been, Madge," said
Eva.
"Madge and I have been delayed ar

"Oh, Eva," exclaimed my sailor boy.

"I hope the two boys got away," said
another.
"I'm not on speaking terms with the old

however, we struck the wall just below
Havengore Cre'ek. I knew the spot well,
which was lucky. Looking back over the
sands, I saw two distant figures f ollow-

: ''Jacfc." I said, "if we; can only put
Beauchamp on a false scent, you and Eva
will be safe. There's no time' to be lost:
listen to me. You and Eva go on by the
side of the creek, and you can either walk
to the village or get a bargee to take you
to Raglesham in his boat. You will be
sure to find several bargees off the brick
fields yonder. . Madge and I will decoy
Beauchamp northward toward Foulness;
then weUl give him the slip and return
aboard again before the tide has had
time to flow."
"I can't leave Madge." said Eva, anx
iously.
" "You must, Eva." said Madge. "Don't
trouble a bit about me. and besides I
can't go into civilization like this. Don't
ruin everything, Eva."
"Jack, we must not leave her," Eva
pleaded;
"Don't be silly," said Madge, and fling
ing her arms around Eva's neck kissed
her good-by.
We crossed the dry mouth of the creek
and hurried north along the sands. Our
pursuers sighted us and changed their
course. Presently we mounted the sea
wall and ran across its- summit until we
came to some saltings that afforded ex
cellent cover. ; Being out of sight of the
captain, we took refuge in a dry sully.
In a few minutes we heard the heavy
tread of feet and the muttered curses of
panting lips, and the captain and one fof
his officers passed. The old man seemed
pretty well done up and dragged himselfÂ»
along painfully. As they passed I felt
my companion thrust her arm through
mine and the moonlight fell upon a little
face plaintive in its excitement.
' "Thank goodnesa, he's gone." she said.
"Oh, how my heart is beating."
We waited a few minutes, then com
menced our walk back. Madge was feel-
Ing the effects of fatigue and excitement
and leaned rather heavily on my arm. I
would have gladly picked her up and car
ried her.
Well, to get to the end of my yarn, we
got aboard the yacht and told Rogers how
that the runaway couple had made good
their escape.
We got the yacht off as the tide flowed
and sailed round to Raglesham. The tug
was lying at anchor "with her crew turned
in as we got under way. Bringing up off
the village at about 9:30 o'clock, I hurried
ashore and was met at the causeway by
Mr. and Mrs. Musgrave. They had spent
the night in the village of Barling, and
gone on to Raglesham in the morning and
got married j as per arrangement. On
leaving- the church the welcome sight of
the yacht sailing serenely up the river in
the bright sunshine met their gaze.
Jack and his wife went on ahead to
warn his friend tha-t two more guests
Eva ran up to the Vicarage and bor
rowed some attire from, the vicar's wife
for Madge, and then we all went aboard.
We congratulated the happy pair, but it
was easy to see that a shadow of anxiety
rested on the bride's face. I guessed Its
generous cause. The wedding breakfast
was to be given at the Vicarage and
thither wo all presently repaired.
You're* keeping the gentleman waiting,"
paid the officer.
"Half a minute, sir, if you don't mind,"
raid one of them. The other young beggar
actually winked at me. Two other young
boys took the bags down to the boat, while
my two dived below.
"More farewells, . I suppose," I said to
the officer, with a smile. Some youngsters
were skylarking aloftâ doubtless with a
purposeâ and their daring gymnastics
caught the officer's attention. He took a
few steps forward and shouted for them
to come down, which they did not appear
anxious to do. Just then the, two boys re
appeared, and skipping across the deck,
descended the ladder. They had their sou'
westers pulled well over their faces, and
their oilskin coats were thrown over their
shoulders. I followed hastily, leaving the
officer rating the skylarkers. He came to
the gangway as we were entering the
boat, and hurled some sarcasm at the
boys for wearing oilys now the rain had
stopped, and also passed disparaging re
marks at their want of smartness In tum
bling into the dingy. It must have struck
the fellow as being strange that the boys
eat aft while Jack and I took the oars. In
fact, I saw a puzzled look come into his
face, and heard him utter an ejaculation
of surprise. He evidently thought some
thing strange was happening.
f'Hurrah!" she cried.
We soon arrived alongside the Lillth
and found Rogers had everything ready
We bent our backs to our work and sent
the little boat flying over the water. Our
two new hands sitting on the stern-bench
did not have the appearance of rollicking
young sea-dogs. Poor girl?, they had been
through a trying ordeal. Eva was"deathly
pale and not far off fainting, I imagined.
Madge had stood the strain best, and now
clasped Eva's hand tightly in hers, and in
many mute little ways tried to cheer and
comfort her cousin. AsÂ» we increased the
distance between us and the Grampus her
eyes brightened, and her face caught the
flush of excitement She did not allow her
embarrassment to overpower her, as did
Eva, but seemed to catch th'e true spirit
of adventure and rise upon it. As I
watched her little flushed face peeping
from beneath the sou'wester, I was forced
to admit that for the first time In my life
I was afloat with a girl who harmonized
with her surroundings. "You're a plucky
little girl. Miss Madge," I thought.
"They are not chasing us, are, they?"
she asked me.
"No. no," I answered, reassuringly,
"we've completely given them the slip."
for a start. There was a nice whole-sail
breeze from the westward, and in a few
minutes the yacht was under way, hurry
ing seaward. ,
Musgrave gave a sigh of relief, and the
tension of his features relaxed. "So far,
Â£0 good, Jack," I said.
"You're a good fellow, Drake," he re
marked, "and your nerves are like Iron."
I did not tell him what a miserable funk
I'd been in aboard the Grampus.
The girls had retired to the after cabin
to attire themselves more conventionally.
The skylight was opened an inch or so for
ventilation, and I heard Madge chattering
as I stood at the tiller. Then I heard Eva
utter an exclamation of dismay, and her
cousin exclaim. "Oh, goodness!" A si
lence followedâ broken by Madge's rip
pling laughter. Evidently nothing very
serious had happened. Presently Eva said,
"You have my dress. Madge."â and the
reply came, "Certainly not, Eva. I'm all
right as I amâ I don't care." Jack came
aft.
' "There's something wrong- with the
wardrobe," I said, nodding toward the
ladies' cabin. In a few minutes Eva's
head appeared at the companion, and Jack
ran to her.
"Oh, Jack," I heard her say, "those
stupid boys have made such a terrible
mistake. They packed their bags intend
ing to escape later in the evening, . and
somehow Madge's bag got mixed with
theirs, and now she finds that she has cot
Wood's things, and I suppose he has got
hers. What shall we do?"
I admit it was most heartless conduct on
my part, but really I could not help laugh
ing up my sleeve. But, you know, I did
not feel that the roguish Madge would be
overpowered by the contretemps. If, It
had been Eva who had lost her bag, I
should have been sorry for tier.
On a strong ebb, tide, and with the wind
dead aft, we made a good ten knots past'
the land. The night was clear, and we
should have the moon presently. One
thing was certainâ none of the ship's boats
could overtake us while the breeze held, j I
began to feel hungry, which was. a' sure
sign my anxiety was wearing off. Rogers
came aft, and I went. down t<$ tea. '
Eva was looking pale and interestingly
distraught, but' she gave me a generous
smile and offered her hand. I was always
a lout with women, but to show how im
pregnated I was by the spirit of romance.
I bent down and kissed her fingers. Think
of that, ye fair damsels who have 'flouted
me! Jack was quite affected. I expected
our sailor boy (the very uniform suggest-
Madge, but the first is the solid fact."
"Jack told Eva, and she told' me, that
you were a wretch â a woman-hater."
"That's nnother fact." I remarked.
"I think It's shameful. You really can't
mean it, Mr. Drake?"
"To apply to you?" I put in, "certainly
not â that would be, absurd." ' \\
"Oh, I think I had better' go below
again." But she didn't.
"What a glorious night," she said pres
ently.' "It must be lovel" to be a sailor,"
and she commenced singing "A Life on
the Ocean Wave." Laugh if you like, but
we callous beggars are softer than we
think.
I "I say, won't you feel 'cold?. I can't
leave |he helm, and you'll find my pilot
coat hanging by the side of the ladder.
You'd better go and get It." She went
below and got the coat.
"Eva's looking very much better," she
said.
"I'm glad of that. Let me help you on."
Steadying the tiller with my knee, I held
the coat for her to slip her arms into it.
Girls always used to glare at me when I
helped them with their wraps and things;
but then I never knew which was the
right side up. and as often as not . helfi.
them upside down, or Inside out, or hind
part. beforeâ never getting the right bear
ing of the things. But a pilot coat's dif
ferent. Madge slipped into it, and I'but
toned it and turned up the collar. You
see. her hands were half way up the
sleeve, so how could j she help herself?
She didn't say "thanks, very much." In
a tone that Implied "you clumsy idiot,
you." like girls generally do,; but just
looked at me, and a good deal more sen
sible and expressive I thought it. There
was a softened glitter in her eyes,' and a
little smile at the corners of her mouth
that spoke the truth. A good binnacle
lamp is always desirable. .
.' That was rattier a pretty sail down Sea
Reachâ take it altogether.
' "I suppose Jack and Eva are discussing
the wedding," said Madge. - " -
Â¦ "I expect so. Jack : has -.made all ar

"What a .. funny experience It has all

seems like a dream."
â¢ "A pleasant dream."
"I hope dear Eva will be happy. ' Do
you know, Mr.- Drake, I had a wedding

a. bad omen."

we'll sink you.*' Â¦ .
"What's to be done, Rogers?" I asked In
a whisper. -- :
"He'll be drawing; more water than us;
let's gibe over and run into shoal water
on the edge of the Mapllns."
Jack sprang to the weather runner and
cast it off. The tug Â¦was closing In upon
us when I put up the helm, and the boom
came over with a Jerk that made the ves
sel heel. Madge was standing by my
Bide, and I clasped her round the waist
to Bteady her. You know : a man can't
stand on ceremony in a sudden glbft.
Trimming in the sheets, we started off on
a broad reach for the sands.
' "If we can pick up the East Shoebury
buoy," said Rogers, "I know a llttlo
swatch-way we can run into." The tug
was after us, but as we neared the sand,
I heard the" engine-room bell ring, and I
guessed he was- slowing up. We sighted
the buoy, and Rogers taking the helm ran
the yacht into the swatch-way. The tug
dared not follow, and we noticed that she
came-to just inside the buoy.
"What's the -next move, Rogers?" I
asked.
"Well, sir, if .you want to give the old
gentleman the slip, I should run on*- till
we ground. Then go ashore."
"Jack," I said, "that's the very thing.
Beauchamp is.aure to come off in the tug's

"They're getting it over now, sir; I can

"Come along. Jack, fetch up Eva; we're

I am ready to admit that I funked go-

I told Jack It was clearly his duty, but
he excused himself on the ground that
he might be recognized. He 'remained In
the boat while I ran up the accommo
dation ladder and stepped through tha
gangway, whera a petty officer was
standing guard.
"My boys ready?" I asked. ,
*"Oh. let me see, youjre from the yacht.

There were sfx training ships on the
Tiver Thames, so I shall not be personal in
referring to one of them under a fictitious
name. Captain Beauchamp commanded
the Grampus, and during his earlier
career in the navy nis superior officer.
Commander Musgrave, had reported him
lor some dereliction of duty, whereby his
prospects were blighted. So that our
Borneo and Juliet had parental Montagues
and Capulets to thwart their love.
It does not naturally follow that thÂ»
commander of a training ship should be
a cross-grained martinet, though the life
Tnay be conducive to such a development;
but the captain of the Grampus was an
autocrat of the good old school. His
daughter, however, possessed a sweet lit
tle will of her own. and refused to be the
slave of her arrogant father. She was a
handsome blonde, and proved herself to
be as sweet and gentle as she was do
voted and determined.
"When the old man heard of the engage
ment he fumed and made the atmosphere
of the battleship a bit suffocating^ but as
tc-OE as his fury had effervesced itself Into
a elate of calm he chuckled and thanked
his stars he lived on a vessel moored out
on the river and not ashore. He was cap
tain of the Grampus and could rule all
aboard with an iron hand. No medieval
Baron could have dealt more effectively
with a recalcitrant daughter than it was
ir. his power to do. So Eva was locked
In l.er stateroom at night and confined to
the Â£Â±Jp during the day. He vowed he'd
bring tbÂ« sirl to her senses.
M-usgraTe took me into his confidence;

M!ss Beanchamp standing on the gallery-
Come and spend a few days aboard and
we'll try and open up communication with

He did so. and Hiss Beauchamp soon
recognized him. It was rather a quaint

means of a fishing line suspended from
her stateroom window.
TCIth a discreet fellow like myself act-
Ing as Postmaster General, this clandes
tine corre?ponder.ce was carried on suc
cessfully. The first letters that passed
were merely silly protestations of love
end did not concern me. but presently Eva
wrote in a different strain. Her father
Â¦was treating her shamefullyâ she could
r.o longer tolerate the indignities of her
position. Her cousin Madge was coming
on a visit, and they would take counsel
toseiier.
A second young lady appeared on the
rtern gallery the next dayâ a piquant lit
tle brunetteâ an affectionate and impul
sive creature, to Judge from her bearing.
I was not wrong In thinking that this
little Madge would bring matters to a
crisis. That night's post brought us the
following- from Eva:
"ily cousin and I have seriously dis
cussed my position, and I have resolved
to put an end to this Intolerable captivity.
Escape Is most difflcult. as there la al
ways an officer on watch to prevent tho
boys from deserting. We hope, however,
same opportunity will aid us."
"We discussed the matter half through
the night, and the result of our delib
erations was that Alusgrave asked her to
elope vrith him. so that they could bo
married at once. This she agreed to do,
nrsd asked Jack to help them to escape
from the ship, stipulating that Madge
was to come, too, for she would not leave
her cousin to meet her father's wrath.
nor would Madge leave the ship until
she <Eva) had got safely away.
Tfcis step decided on we made our plans.
I wrote to the captain in the name of a
fellow clubman whose yacht lay further
down the river, asking' to be supplied
â¢with a couple of time-expired lads. The
ship. I knew, was always glad to find
berths for the boys, and I received a re
ply staling that two reliable lads were
at my disposal and awaiting instructions
to join the yacht. Of course we were act
ins in collusion with Eva, and after com
municating' with her, fixed a certain
evening on which to call for the boys.
In the meantime the girls had to arrange
their difficult and trying escapade, and
Jack to st-.e to his part of the contract.
Our anxiety was lightened by our knowl
edge at the fact that the boys' on the ship
liked Eva as much as they hated the
captain, and I had little doubt that the
bewitching: Madge would soon surround
herself with a train of loyal courtiers.
We moved the yacht half a mile down
the river, and there waited the eventful
day. My man Rogers, t being: a trust
-vorthy fellow, was taken In our confi

Rogers was familiar, but he was loyal;

BOYSOME VERY EXCENTRIC
DISPOSALS OF PROPERTY
o aj7 CHEN Benjamin Franklin died,
VVJ in 1790. he left a small sura of
\j\j money which was not to be
usfd until the twentieth cen
tury. His gift is at last available, and
the sum now amounts to $375,000, having
been Invested at compound interest.
The trustees of the Franklin fund have
decided to use the money for the erection
of a Franklin Institute in Franklin
square. Boston.
Curious provisions made by will are
more common than 'one would suppose.
Within the last few months there have
been several examples of eccentric dis
posals of property. To one young woman
has been left S23.000 by her brother under
the express conditions that she neither
marries nor becomes a nun. If the con
ditions aro. not fulfilled tho money i3 to
be distributed among other relatives.
To his three daughters an Italian who
recently died left $500 a year each if they
remained single and $2500 each a year if
they married. Â¦
V A late member of the English Parlia
ment left by will to his two daughters
5720.C0O, with the provision that the money
is only to be payable if they attain the
age of thirty-five without marrying either

Telegraph WIres Are
Good Weather Prophets
CCORDING to Dr. Eydam, a Ger
/lJ\ man physician, there are no more
it "^ reliable weather prophets than tel
- egraph wires. This novel discovery
was made by him in . the following 'man
ner: As be was waiting for a train at a
country- station ho heard a shrill sound,
which was made by the wind as It passed
through a Â¦ net work of nearby wires. At
once'the doctor remembered that he had
frequently heard a similar sound either
immediately before or after a stornVor a
heavy fall of rain or snow, and it natur
ally, occurred to him to try and ascertain
whether there was any connection be
tween the sound and such changes in the
weather.
As a heavy shower of rain fell within
forty-eight' hours after! he had heard the
â¢ound at iJne railroad station, he conclud-
ed that there was such a connection, and
he then determined to investigate the
matter thoroughly. As a result he now
maintains, first, that any unusual disturb
ance in the telegraph wires is an infallible
indicator of bad weather, and. second
that the nature of the changes In the at
mosphere may be learned-frOm the sound"
which the wind makes when passing
through the wires. \yV : ;> * H
Thus a deep sound, he says, which is of
considerable or medium strength indicates
that there will be slight showers of rain
with moderate winds within from thirty
to forty-eight hours, and.^ on the other
hand, a sharp, 8hrill sound is the sure
token of a heavy storm, which will be ac
companied by much rain or snow.

THE fruit garden comes, well within
the range of household economics.
An acre is none too_iruÂ»eh for it. yet
it may be brought within the con
fines of an ordinary village lot. The tini
est back yard has space for at least a
grapevine, a dwarf fruit tree and a
strawberry barrel. Set the vine so it may
be (rained over a light trellis shading the
back door. Dig out a hole for it at least
three feet square and board the hole all
around with rouph lumber painted with
coal tar. This will last a long time and
keep t'.ie vine roots from damaging: drains
or cellar walls, If, every fall,, when the
sap is well down, the roots are cut along
the board line with an ax or sharp-edged
spa<3e. Such root pruning* properly done
is an aid to health and fruitfulness.
In the corner farthest from the vine set
the tree. The strawberry barrel needs all
the light and sunshine possible. It must
be stout and well hooped, otherwise it is
not worth while. Begin by taking out one
head, then bore the sides full of two-Inch
holes and bottom full of half-inch ones.
Bury it half way, fill with very rich earth,
set some sort of drain in the middle and
let the earth slope . lightly toward the
drain. Plant a strong vine in every hole
and a row all around the top. A barrel
prepared in May or June and well tended,
especially if planted with pot-grown
vines, ought to bear., next season. The
main trouble is to keep it well watered.
In warm weather water it twice a day,
before sunrise and late In the afternoon.
Once a week give a copious watering of
liquid manure. Pick outsail weeds and
semi-occasionally lighten the earth with
a garden trowel. Protect through the
Â¦winter with boughs of i cornstalks. In
spring, as soon as the buds swell, water
plentifully, and. until the berries are with

nure twice a week. When the earliest

A plat of 93 by 50 feet may be made to
yield an astonishing supply of fruit. Given
such dimension in the brick shape un
luckily, so common, run narrow paths
down each side next the fences and plant
in them grape vines with roots projecting
inward. For six inches around the stems
the earth should be kept light and loose
and in winter the whole root spread needs
a good coat of coarse manure. Train the
vines up against the fence or on wires
stretched inside it. Keep the canes well
shortened and summer prune from." June
forward, rubbing off all but two or three
new shoots. In the fall cut back these
new canes to sound, fully ripened
wood. .
All along beside the end fence dig! a
trench four feet wide and five feet deep,
the whole plot breadth. Board up ] the
sides stoutly with well-tarred boards,
then fill in the first with a foot of stones,
brickbats, old shoes, bones and general
coarse litter. Upon top of that put six
inches of rotted manure, and cover with
rich earth to within a foot "of the top.
Thus, in spite of the boarding which will
keep in the roots, the trees will be in no
danger of starving.
â¢ Plant three dwarf fruit treats In the
ditch, spreading out their roots well, then
filling in the remaining foot with the fin
est, lightest earth. Tramp and pack firm
ly, heaping .the earth a little, then mulch
the whole trench surface thickly so as to
keep down the weeds. Once In six months
or so rake off the mulch, dig up the whole
space, using a three-tined fork, and never
prying out the roots, replace the mulch,
thickening it as necessary, and water
â¢whenever there is even a hint of 'drought.
Fruit trees will always be the better for
a copious sunset watering, also at mid
day or 1 o'clock, if the leaves droop per-
ceptibly. #
A good tree selection is a pear, a peach,
a plum, or a cherry. Choose a very early
pear and a very late peach. Very early
peaches seldom bear fruit enough to be
worth while. A medium early sort will
give more satisfaction. Keep down all
suckers. Dwarf trees being grafted upon
other than their own roots, if alien shoots
come up, the budded trunk will die. Sum
mer prune, which means pinch back all
shoots to a compact, symmetrical -head,
flattish rather than round, with no branch
extending beyond the trench. Every
spring dig away the earth around the
trunks down to the crown of the root, ex
amine for borers, and, if found, dig them
out and burn. Wash the trunks well with
strong soap suds the first warm day. If
insects attack the foliage either cover
them, a tree at time, with a sheet
or burn half a pound of sulphur under
neath it, or spray well with some insecti

â¢ Probably the class who are the best
buyers of these colored-to-order meer
schaums is collegians, who want to show
fine pipes, but who have neither the pa
tience nor thejriull to produce tho effect
themselves. .
The best meerschaums, it is said, come
from Turkey, and the designs are worked
out and cut upon the meerschaum In Vi
enna.
This kind of work as a rule takes all
the time and attention of the men. but
some or them are so perfect that they
can devote themselves to designing
shapes and figures fcr new pipes, special
attention being given to the possibility of
producing quaint effects in the coloring.
The highly accomplished among: these
young fellows can get away with four
ounces of tobacco a day. They are paid
weli, and they have their regular holi
days. Some of them have been with
their employer for five years. But it
isn't a business in which onÂ© may stay
a- lifetime, for, though they appear able
to smoke for years, night and day, with
out hurting them, when they get to bo
old men their occupation has made them
too nervous to be useful. The proprietor
himself smokes not at all, when
he Is teaching an apprentice how to go
about It. The new hand receives a cheap
pipe, and after being toJd how to go
ahead is left to himself to show what he
can do. There are prize competitions,

become proficient are graduated to taJce
their seats with the notables on the sec

can take his pipe and hava It smoked
until the desired color Is obtained. Such
an enterprise exists In the outskirts of
London and makes a fine competence for
its proprietor, an Austrian. It Is a larga
house that used to be the country seat
of an English gentleman. Hither come
every day a score of young men who are
the "experienced employes of the house.
They pass upstairs to the business room
in the rear of the house, seat themselves
In arm chairs and forthwith begin their
day's work of smoking meerschaum
pipes. Each one knows the art of smok
ing steadily, neither too fast nor too
slow. The tobacco they use is a special
blend of the proprietor's, for he knows it
is only rarely that the right kind of to
bacco is used for thl3 purpose. The bowls
of the pipes which these young men
smoke are covered with wash leather so
that they cannot by any chance be
harmed or improperly stained.

to, "If at flrst you don't succeed, try, try
again." constantly in his memory. 1
Then one gloriously sunny day he
gained his point," and has never lost an
inch of ground, and, Judging from the
looks of things at the present time, never
will. S
These two tall Dalmatians seemed made
for each other. . â¢
As Bakulich said, "What wrs the
earthly use in waiting for a long time?
I loved Andriane and she loved me, so
why not get married and spend my va
cation together?" '
So he insisted, and insisted " and kept
right on insisting until Andriane married
him "to get rid of him." .
It took Just fifteen days fiom the ctart
of the courtship to the happy consumma
tion, and Virgil thinks he wasn't so very
slow. â¢
it wasn't so awfully strange, after all,
perhaps. Their parents had been neigh
bors for years, and Virgil could lie In his
bed and see the house that Andriane was
born in. â¢ , â¢ .~-
This tall bridal couple started out on
their wedding trip. They visited various
parts of Europe, and wandered aimlessly
hither and thither until it was time for
Bakulich to report at police headquarters
in San Francisco. i .
Then he brought the girl who had only
known him for such a brief time across
the water. Away from her family, all
her friends, and even her country. She
certainly proved her love for him when
she did that, for it requires strong con
victions and great moral courage to leave
behind, all that is connected with one's
youth' and to tear oneself away from
father and mother.
She believed as did our friend of long
ago, "Whither thou goest. I will go,' 1 and
like her also, went.
When reached New York the
policemen had already heard the news
and they were brimful of curiosity. They
met Mr. f.nd Mrs. Bakulich and ques
tioned them fast and furiously. Didn't,
Wasn'tâ and - Wasn't Didn't, all over
again. Talk about women! y
Through It all Andriane could only smile
and now â¢ and trfffi resort to her hand
language, which, by the way. has im
proved wonderfully since her sojourn in
this city.
The fellow officers insisted that an in
terpreter had been employed and that Vir
gil had met his wife in Rome. How could
Bakulich get up enough nerve to propose
to .a girl through another fellow, and
stand right beside her at that?
To all kinds of vigorous expostulations
and Indignant "I dldn'ts" they deliberate-
ly closed and barred their ears. It was
delightfully romantic to think that one of
them had stood In the Parthenon by
moonlight and had been bo eminently suc
cessful.
"Why. the idea of It; It's absurd 1 My
wife and I can talk with perfect ease In
several languages," and Bakulich fairly
bristles when he even thinks, about it.
They slipped quietly into San Francisco
tired and awfully cramped, for six days
and nights in a Pullman Isn't a restora
tive for anybody, let alone seven-footers.
Everywhere they went the same curious
crowd turned and gazed and made re
marks, and they still continue to do so,
by the way.
California people are accustomed to
large girls and are Justly proud of them,
but they don't, as a rule, raise girls who
go over the six-foot mark.
Business kept him away. His relations
insisted on giving him dinners, luncheons
and every other old thing to keep him
busy. His friends took occasion to tease
him a little. Everything went wrong for
two long, miserable weeks, but Cupid had
sent too straight an arrow to be lightly
Then he tried to get an introduction to
her, for he somehow felt it in his bones
that she was the only girl on earth for
him.
Then everybody commenced to iaugh.
and Virgil failed to see tho Joke. But
only for an instant. Several girls were
coming toward the group of men, and
one girl loomed above her companions
head and shoulders. What was -more to
the point she was pretty, and from the
way she was* smiling appeared to be Jolly,
too.
So that was the first gllmps.e that Bak
ulich got of his wife. - :
That's where he showed the man in him.
No, Vir wasn't married yet.
"Well, old man. you are getting old
enough to commence thinking about it."
Informed his kind friend. "What kind of
girls do you like?"
Then it Â¦was that Bakulich settled down
and told them that he couldn't find any
one to please him, and furthermore, that
he wanted a wife who could look into his
eyes without standing on a chair. He
liked large girls, the larger the better,
only they must be pretty.
So Virgil met and confabbed with his
friends of long ago. It took them some
time to get over the marvel of his six feet
and about as many inches and his 350 solid
pounds. Then they commenced to ply him
with questions about America and the life
that he led out in that far-away place.
One fellow said: .
"Not married yet, are you, Vir?"
If he had. he micht have thought twice
before leaping, but as it was he walked
right into Cupid's little snare Just ! as
many another fellow had done before him.
How could he help U when love and fate
led the way? , '
About eight months ago Virgil N. Bak
ulich, known as the tailest policeman in
San Francisco and a brilliant Greek schol
ar, took it into his head to visit the home
of his boyhood days.
Little did he dream that he would go
over one and come back two.
A real, true love story in which Cupid,
a man's determination and a few kind
friends figured strongly.
She has a romance!

LEAH MAT must look sharp. She
will find that there are other tall
people â and not so very far away
from her height, either. _
Andriane Babulich is six feet four
and a half inches taiL Her four and a
half inches creep to five and a half, and
sometimes add an extra half-inch wlien
she puts her shoes on.
And she is still growing!

the case, then. Indeed, may Leah com

But Mrs. Virgil N. Bakulich has more

SAN FRANCISCO'S
TALLEST
POLICEMAN
AND HIS
ROMANTIC MARRIAGE
The only consolation that Mrs. Virgil N.
Bakulich has for being called a freak and
for being a stranger In a strange land is
that she is still horribly Interested In her
own husband.
They both agree that Cupid had a. fin
ger In their pie, and maybe two.
"Andriane gets lonely and It Is hard on
her because she can't understand people.
She appears at poor advantage, too. Oh,
we are uaed at people staring now. They
always do," and Bakulich chuckled as he
recalled the rubbernecks.
Mrs. B. with girlish pride showed me
her wedding frocks. Just for fun I tried
one on and I looked like a baby in long
clothes and was almost as helpless. When
the skirt was fastened a la Mother Hub
bard fashion It was too long to'comfort
ably walk In.
Then It was that Bakulich said all sorts
of bad things about himself for bringing
his wife to_a new country, but wound up
with the question, "What else could Z
do?"
Verily, what else would any other man
do?
After fl^.een minutes' talk we came to
the collusion that Mr. Baku-
HcX 1 was the only thing that both of us
were certain of, excepting: that we had
succeeded most beautifully In waking up
the lord and master of the house. Then
I waited for Virgil and while I sat waiting
a dainty table was placed before me, and
coffee, rolls and fruit were served ma by
his wife.
"Got any rags, bottles, sacks to-day?"
or "Strawberries, strawberries: 10 cents a
box. Want to see them, lady?"
A dozen times a day Andriane goes to
the door, and a dozen times a day she
fails utterly to comprehend what the
caller wants unless he pokes his wares
under her nose.
Think of being in a strange country
with absolutely no frl?nds and not being
able to understand a word that is spoken
to you! Think of the thousand and one
vexatious things that araf always and for
ever bobbing up to annoy you. when you
are not fully able to Rive tit for tat. Im
agine how dreadfully hartdleapped yon
would be in every respect, and how terri
bly lonely and stupid it would be. It
would take an American girl Just about a
month to get Rood and sick of It and to
pack her little trunk and go home to
mother.
Perhaps Dalmatians train their children
better than most Americans do. for An
driane has been over here between three
and four months and she i3 decidedly
cheerful yet and delightfully hospltabl*
when she gets a chance.
When I called at their flat the maid
chanced to answer the bell. Yes: Mrs. Ba
kulleh was at home, but shÂ« couldn't un
derstand a word of English. Should, she
call her?
Then the mistress of the house appeared,
and I wondered whether I should better
take to my heels and run while I had a
chance, for she looked like a giantess who
had Just stepped out of a fairy book.
After a while they settled down In a
cozy flat on Taylor street and spent their
time In getting furniture large enough to
be comfortable. No ordinary sized bed
room woii'd do for them. Well, hardly, as
the bed is in Itself over eight, feet long
and takes up a goodly space the other
way. Everything In their house Is built
on the extension plan. Imagine one of
them sitting on a tiny chair! -it might fall
down in the first place, and. secondly,
their knees would be In their faces all the
time, and last, but not least, that position
Isn't at all graceful.
But though the path of their love was
not strewn with thorns, it wasn't exactly
covered with roses either. When Virgil is
afhome there Is no difficulty, but the>
minute he goes out about his duties trou
ble is sure to brew.
B-r-r-r goes the doorbell.
THE SUNDAY GALL.
6a more comfortably Inhabited look than
low, easy chairs, hassocks and footstools,
rich sofa cushions and broad couches. In
a room which bears the impress of re
fined, intelligent living there should also
be at least one broad, substantial table at
which to write and on which lie the latest
magazines or the last popular novel, etc.
Â¦i his table, to be complete, should hold a
shaded light, either an electric light
brought up from the floor or down by a
cord from the ceiling (it can be so shaded
and arranged as to represent a handsome
reading lamp) or one of the tall lamps In
standards called banquet lamps. This
lamp can be so decorated with an artistic
shade as to be one of the features of your
room.
One thinks of an easy chair as. neces
sarily an expensive piece of furniture, but
a determined and energetic woman can
get around this obstacle by searching the
Becond-hand shops for a large, comfort
able, stuffed chair, -the glory of whose
covering has departed. It may once have
been covered with brocade, but she can
rejuvenate it with some or the art denims
which are brought in such soft shades of
old blue, dark blue, green, old rose, dark
brownish red and clear -wine color that it
will affiliate much more congenially with
its inexpensively artistic surroundings
than if clad In brocade. The striped can
vas, cross-legged chair which is bought
for porches and which costs from SI 50 to
J2, can, with taste and very little trouble,
be transformed into something handscme
enough for a room of this character.
Â¦ While not 'made on the precise principle
of the Morris chair, it can be let down to
any angle of extension one requires.
Therefore If rubbed down and painted to
look like ebony and stretched wilh tapes
try or . velours instead of awning goods,
then filled with cushions of eiderdown cov
ered with silks or rich brocades, it is
transformed into an extremely handsome
article of furniture. A tiny brass beading
let into -the wood of the pieces which
come down the sides makes a still pret
tier finish. More cheaply still. I have seen
one of these chairs ebonized and having a
As you have not a har*dwood floor, cover
it with dark red filling and lay a Turkish
rug under the table. It would be well if
this rug also had some blue in it. Cer
tainly there Is nothing more beautiful for
dorways than handsome Kisklllims.
The large windows you speak of and the

and slightly , _er shade of red. It will
look well between the crossbeams of black
wood, and you. will flnd the effect excel
lent, especially if your electric light of old
brass comes, up close .against it. Have
your chairs made to order in some pretty
' quaint designs. Any thoroughly artistic
architect can - do this for you. As . you
would do well to keep a hint of Venetian
art to the fore in this room, I would have
the back pieces run up in some long twist
ed effect, and then have them stained;
in the very dark Flemish oak. Let the
seats be covered with dark red morocco
and finished with old brass nails. Have.
. a Flemish oak table made with twisted
legs. If you have an impression that to
have furniture made to order by any spe
cial design Is an enormously expensive
fancy I wish to undeceive you- You will
be agreeably surprised to flnd that chairs
of your own design frequently can be
made for less than the more commonplace
patterns found in the shops.
Use a heavy white lace scarf across tha
middle of your table and have for a center
piece a Venetian glass bowl set in silver
filagree. You will flnd, I think, that all
of your silver, cut glass and brasses will
gleam out with extreme beauty in this
room. I like a buffet built into the wall
with doors here and there of brilliant
glass leaded in. Curtala your windows
first with, net which has a heavy white
lace border. Let this border run across
the window, showing heavily against the
glass. If you are fortunate enough to
possess any old Italian ecclesiastical laca
this is the place to use it. FTom the top
of the window to the window seat hang
full draped curtains of some rich Oriental
stuff which has some- blue in it.
which Is slightly off shade from the rest
of the room.
- M. P. G.â By all means set the large
mirror into the wall of your hall. As you
say, It will in this way exactly face the
front door, and as your hall is not large
it will be a great acquisition,- for it
apparently add much depth and certainly
much elegance to the apartment. I would
place some sort of light pedestal with a
growing fern or delicate little palm In it
in front of the mirror if I were you.
INEXPENSIVE' DEVICES THAT LEND
LUXURY. ,
B. M. G.â You ask me for some- general
advice about lending to a simple room
that "air of luxury . which I have sev
eral Â¦ times referred to. I have no doubt
you have smiled over this expression as
being rather strong when used in connec
tion with really Â¦- economical arrange
ments, but I promise you sincerely, if you
will- carry out- practically some of the
hints I am now going to give you, you
will smile with .satisfaction over the 're
sult o\ your work. You must feel that
many rooms,' while expensively furnished,
lack -that air of invitation to: restful ease
which, after, all, lends the real charm to
an interior. It Is more desirable to in
vest a room with this quality than to be
able to spend an unlimited amount of
money on It.- There Is nothing which gives
row of.brass-headed tacks driven into zn*
wood so closely as to look like a beading |
a piece of dark blue denim was then
doubled and stitched together (to give it
sufficient firmness to serve as a seat) ami
stretched over the chair. In this -were
cushions of orange-colored silk, a long one
tied to the back, a square one in the scyr,
which almost hid the blue denim. Thus
It was one of the prettiest, things in a
room which held many that were far more
expensive and intrinsically valuable.
A hassock or largo cushion placed on the
floor can be made of Japanese matting.
Put two pieces, a square of the width of
matting, together and bind them with
wool braid. You will flnd that you caji
readily stitch this on the machine. Make
a firmly stuffed cushion first of white cot
ton or canvas, filling it with excelsior aril
cotton wool, then slip your matting cover
over it. Use this cushion to throw on the
floor and on top of it lay a softer one cov
ered with cotton or silk. This will. give
you a bit of bright color just when some
dingy corner of the room seems to call
for it.
A DINING ROOM m VENETIAN
REDâ L. T. V. I agree with you that
Venetian red is very- rich and handsome
for a dining room. As your woodwork
has .been painted and you cannot use the
Flemish oak stain, I would paint my
heAry white lace In tms room will pre
vent all possibility of Its looking darkj it
will be exceedingly rich, but not glomy.
And now for the mantel, which you con
sider so hopelessly commonplace. Paint
it black and make a lambrequin- for It
coming down in a straight line across tho
front â do not be tempted to drape it â of a
piece of old red brocade, somewhat faded
if you can get it. Border this with gold
galloon, and if you can find a tall Vene
tian bottle with a' twisted neck, or a husÂ»~
"Venetian candlestick, it will pay you to
place it there, as it will lift your mantel
at once out of the commonplace. Your
flredogs should be of brass and selected
to accord with your electric light fixtures.
PAINT FOR BEDROOMSâ You ask my
advice about painting the woodwork for
bed chambers. In a bedroom I prefer the
paint to hardwood. It seems to me to tone
in more softly and beautifully with the
papers. If your paper has a white ground
with yellow roses on it. paint all of your
wood the exact shade of some yellow toao
in the rose. I would select a medium tone,
but be very careful that your painter
catches it exactly. Your yellow mantel
piece will look very attractive with wblta
hearth and tiling.
rich bronzes, rare carvings, cabinet3, etc.,
thougn these latter are not necessary to
give a Japanese effect and may be ac
cumulated at leisure when one has ar
ranged a setting- for them.
First, by all means have y jur paint as
black as ebony or teakwooci, your floor
must be stained dark and highly polished
or (if you prefer it so) covered with fine
Japanese matting. Curtain your windows
with strips In widths of stuff unsewed
together of blue and white cotton crepe,
Japanese. Do not use white muslin with
them.ss You will flnd that the blue and
white against the black woodwork of
your window casing is beautiful, and I
would hang several strips at each win
dow. If you can procure for your door
way one of the Japanese curtains which
come In strips of embroidery on colored
silks you will be fortunate. Have your
pots of plants (dwarf cypress trees, etc.)
Fet near the floor on the little square
teakwood stands which lend such a for
eign look. Place a flowering azalea or
small rope t*-ee in full bloom in a pot on
a high shelf.
A dado of fine matting running up "to tie
black candle shelf around the walls is
beautiful, and above that the walls shoulJ
be colored a dull blue. For a frieze above
your black picture molding you may be
able to find a paper which represents Jap
Â£.rse figures and trees, In blue on a white
ground.' I found It once and used It sev
eral years ago. Tho effect was exquisite
and Japanese to a degree. The cotton
crepe would also make a good frieze. As
for furniture I would use only bamboo and
teakwood. You will find also that .one of
their vivid scarlet panels of embroidery
will add much life and beauty to your
room.
THE DRAPING OF WINDOWS AND
DOOKWAYSâ In window drapery it Is
often merely a matter of taste whether
the curtains hang to the floor or are cut
off at the sill, but it is also sometime^ a
matter of construction. For a casement
window there Is seldom a questionâ the
curtain should fall only to the sill. Cass-
ment windows are meant to Iootk wide, and
short curtains strengthen this effect.
These short curtains may be caught back
midway with cords and tassels, If straight
muslin curtains next the panes are un
derneath them; or, all.colored and white,
may be left to hang straight ami full to
gether.- In hanging muslin, or net, or silk
at casement windows do not sew any of
the breadths together. They .are much
more artistic and airy loking if left hang
ing selvedge to selvedge. The fashion of
trimming with fringes and tassels has for
tunately been abandoned. The outer cur
tain, therefore, you understand, may bo
caught back and the under ones left"
straight or vice versa. These are all
rather cottage effects. If your windows
are medium long and you wish to five
more height and a statelier look, hang
heavy outside curtains to the floor. <Thesa
curtains may be only of cretonne and yet
will look very rich, If lined with plain
colors in raw silk or sateen. They should
be caught back just above the sill lin Q .
A very commonplace window may be
metamorphosed into a picturesque arrt
Â¦noticeable feature of your room by means
jof its drapery. If, for instance, you have
two plain, mill-made -windows .which are
placed not more than a fc/ot apart, you
can so curtain them that they, will look
On the other hand you- might. If you
choose to do so, merely hang green paper
blinds at these windows and leave them
undraped to stare at you in characterless
stupidity. For curtaining doorways I
would merely advise hanging all drapery
'straight from rods. It is seldom pretty
caught back. A handsome KisklUim rug
should be thrown over a pole and one
end left to hang over straight. They can
be fastened invisibly/ to the pole with
safety pins and push back easily. â¢ Inbuy
ing- a handsome KiskilUm rip "the â¢ seam
which runs down the middle and hang
them with the borders facing one another.
L. M. P.â You ask about the fireplace
tiling in your yellow â¢â¢ room. As "your
woodwork is yellow and your paper yel
low and white, I would have my tiles
white. Indeed, It Is a very safe plan when
you wish to keep a room light and to
give" it a particularly dainty, look to have
white tiling. It is far better than a color
like 9m targe window. This Is done by*,
hanging a valance from the top casing
over . both windows, and letting the
breadths of goods hang from this. One
on either side of the outside edge and one
to cover the wall space between the two
windows. Suppose this poods to be pretty
flowered chintz, and that you have whlto
muslin caught back against the panes,
and suppose you go still further and have
a broad shelf made and fastened to your
sill, so that you can set flower-pots on it i
with blooming plants in them; have you
not thus created an effect which will be a
constant pleasure to you and to your
friends? --Â¦-:".-
A JAPANESE ROOMâ As I do not
know Just what Japanese furniture you
may have it is diincult for me to give
you any precise information; however, I
may be able to help you. I think the
first thing to do in turnishing up to any
particular period or foreign nationality
is to realise in your own mind the salient
twin's, the leading characteristics which
lend the most potent charm to that period
or nationality We know that to embody
a Japanese idea is to produce an effect
of airin<-Ks> and grace almost beyondHhat
of any o'her nation. There must be much
vivid color delicately sprinkled about and
constantly outlined and intermingled with
black. There must be the pale pink of
the cherry bloom, the varied tints of
chrysanthemums and the rich glitter o f
embroideries.
There should be swinging lights In lan
tern shapes and always glowing through
colored glass or silk, and there may be
THE ADAPTATION OT FOREIGN
IDEASâ To furnish a room as the
Japanese would furnish It is one
thins and to furnish It In Americo-
Japanese style is quite another.
There are many people in the United
Stales whose conception of Japanese in
terior* and effects tallies with that of
the stage Fetters cf Sullivan's opera of
"The Mikado." Indeed, I think that the
prevalence of Japanese operettas pro
duced the rage for Japanese furnishing
in our staid American houses a few years
ago While th* finest touches of Japan
ftp* art lie in their use of grays, of black
and white and absolutely neutral tonesâ
and in reality the interior* of their homes
are marked by an absence of furniture
which to the American taste is actually
painfulâ the embodiment of a Japanese
idea in this country usually means a
glittering confusion of colors and of
objets d'art. A lady writing- from Santa
Barbara asks my advice in fitting up a
Japanese loom..

more comfortable for 'the dog to lie on.
Some breeders think that animals are
better for not having anything but boards
to sleep on, claiming that bedding in
jures their coat. This, however, is a
fallacy. Bedding should never be allowed
to remain more than a week at the ut
most, and the house should be thoroughly
cleaned every week or ten days.
It has been said that a dog's goodness
goes in at the mouth, meaning that a
well nourished dog. will turn out a better
animal than one whose wants in this Una
have been neglected. The secrets in feed
ing are: Wholesome food and variety in
diet. Those in a position to know never
advocate the feeding of dogs wholly upon
meat. Such a diet is injudicious, as it is
heating. Meat can be given to a dog three
or fcur times a week, not oftener, in addi
tion to the meal or biscuits which form
the foundation of the daily meal.
Decayed or maggoty meat, such as Is
given to many dogs, is sure to affect their
health sconer or later. They will thrive
better on a small of good food
than an unlimited supply of bad quality.
The subject of how often dogs should be
fed is one that has been much discussed,
v In the case of old dogs once a day is
generally considered ! enough, provided
they are given all they want. In' this
event the evening is the best time for
feeding, as it allows the animal to be put
Â¦ by comfortably for the night, and they
yfill generally sleep quietly after eating.
.''tTounger dogs require more food, and
jhould be given one or two extra meals.
Che meat biscuits which are so generally
Used form an excellent diet, and can ba
givendry or soaked.
Another good food as a basis of diet Is
coarse oatmeal, which should be thor
oughly boiled, or it will disarrange the
dog's " stomach. Bones from which most
of the meat has been scraped 3hould ba
freauently BUDDlIed.as they not only
amuse the dog for hours, but benefit the

lng badly it Is apt to sicken him, when
he will not eat at all, whereas a littla
given him from his master's hand will
most likely be swallowed eagerly. Some
dog fanciers claim that an animal should
be fed off the ground, but this Is not a
good plan. They should be fed from a
plate or a tin of some kind.
The best feeding vessels for dogs are
probably round baking tins, which will
be found in every family. A dog should
also have all the fresh water he wants.
The value of this point can hardly be
overestimated, for, although he will drink
almost anything, he is sure to be upset
by bad water sooner or later.

DOGS like comforts the same as hu
man beings. They want a roomy
house, a good place to sleep and
kind treatment, and will repay
their owner for all that is done for their
comfort.
A dog house should be raised from the
ground, as the dampness will give the
animal cold and rot the floor. A few
pieces of three-inch flooring placed un
derneath or some bricks will serve the
purpose in every way.
Bee that the opening of the house Is on
one side, so that the wind and- rain will
be turned off as much as possible. It is
never good to chain a dog in his house;
better drive a stout piece of quartering
into the ground about one foot and fasten
the chain to this. Chain a dog only when
necessary.

FASHION SHOESAPABLE of discharging 116 bullets
ff a minute, at high initial velocity,
the new automatic pistol adopted
by the Board of Ordnance and For
tification for the United States army is in
many respect* a remarkable weapon. As
a first step toward the equipment of the
army with the new arm, an order for 1000
of the, pistols for the use of the cavalry
has been placed with the manufacturers.
Exhaustive tests by Government experts
have been made, which seem to Indicate
that the principle of the automatic field
gun and magazine rifle have been combin
ed In practical form In a pistol no heavier
than the revolver with which the army is
now equipped.
Named for its inventor, GÂ«org Luger, a
former officer In the Austrian army, the
Lug-cr automatic pistol Is made, by the
German Arms and Ammunition Factories.
This concern has manufactured about
6,000,000 Mauser, rifles for European ' na
tions, and has also brought out several
types of automatic pistols. H. Tauscher,
one of the representatives of the company,
who came to this country to submit the
Luger pistol to tfc# Government, said re
cently, when seen at his hotel, that the
new pistol was the result of ten years' ex
periment.
"We brought out the Borchardt. the
Mauser and Browning, and tested the
Mannlicher, the Bergmann and others,"
eaid Mr. Tauscher. â¢ "All governments

the Swiss.
"At a test which It Instituted In 1896
the Borchardt, which employed the 'link
system' of feeding from the magazine,
was deemed superior. This is the system
that has shown value in the Maxim guni
and Is now used in many arms. The Swiss
ordnance officer asked for a smaller arm
than the Borchardt, and Mr. Georg Luger,
the inventor of the Mannlicher, set to
work 'to reconstruct the arm, retaining
only the link system. Switzerland made a
test in 1838, % and in 1893 its military com
mission adopted the Luger pistol.
i "In a recent test at Washington the pis
tol met all requirements arid received the
unanimous approval of the members of
the board. Its chief points are its fine
shape'. Its balance, its precision of aim. Its
rapidity of fire and its great simplicity. It
operates on the link system, has a maga
zine containing: eight cartridges, which Is
thrown out when empty and may be re
placed by a single movement. It uses a
22-caliber bullet. The initial velocity of
1200 feet a second gives a greater striking:
effect than a 44-callper bullet from, the
pistol now in use In this country.'*

What Wars Cost

THE disbursements by the United
States treasury on account of thÂ« '
Civil War from July 1. 1SS1. to JunÂ«
30,. 1ST?, amounted to $3,187,243,285.
Thomas E. Wilson, in the Review of
the Republic for March, estimates that
the additional Civil War disbursements
for dubt, interest and pensions from Juna
30, 1879, to July 1, 1900, amounted to
$3,904,838,775, making a total Federal ex
penditure, of $10,092,C82,160. The disburse
ments of the Confederate Government
exceeded $3,000,000,000 for thÂ© mere main
tenance of armies In the field. Mr. Wil
son estimates that the Governmental ex
penditures on both sides in the Civil
War will, when the books aro closed,
amount to $17,772,000,000, and that the In
dividual losses during? the war amount
ed to $30,000,000,000. Placing the cash ex
penditures of the United States In the
Civil War at $17,772,000,000. in the Span
ish, war at $500,000,000 and In the war of
1S12, the Mexican war, and the Indian
wars at $500,000,000, Mr. Wilson makes
the total contribution of the United;
States treasury to the war fund for tha
century $18,772,000,000. It is estimated that
the Napoleonic wars from 1793 to 1315
cost $8,250,000,000; the war between, Rus-
Bla and Turkey In 1S23, $100,000,000; tho

mated that the minor wars of Great Brit
ain in India, Egypt and Africa have cost

wars have cost $1,600,00^.000, and Spain
has epent . in various wars $3,000,000,000.
On these statements presented by Wil
son and Mulhall, manifestly incomplete
and unfair, the United States Civil War
cost more by $7,000,000,000 than ten Euro

believed the prophecy could have neen
fulfilled in 80 short a time.
Prior to August,' 1SS9, the work was as
sociated with the "Armitage Orphanage"
at Ban Mateo.
Finding the house inadequate for the
rapidly increasing numbers, it was de
cided to separate the orphanages, -which
were already separate incorporations, and
on August 10, 1SS9, with thirteen girls this
Institution began its career at 570 Harri
son street. San Francisco.
It took Just nine years to build our new
home, which is located at Lake street and
Seventh avenue, but the place represents
a. paid up capital of $60,000 and there is no
home of Its kind that surpasses it In the
city.
Being an Episcopalian home, the insti
tution has a chapel, and it is truly a
beautiful one. About $1500 has been
given to the chapel in memorials, which
could not help but make it more attrac
tive. Things. which we never could have
hoped to have hadâ for instance, a solid
silver baptismal bowl and two very hand
some brass altar vases â have been gen
erously and lovingly given.
The home has been furnished with an
eye for comfort and durability, for It is
the borne of 115 orphans, half-orphans and
forsaken girls. Children are taken in
when they are two years old and in
urgent cases a little younger, and are kept
there until they are 15. When it is time
for them to leave the home the discharge
committee usually knows of some church
family who will take them in. Many
times they are adopted outright, and, for
tunately, there seem to oe many philan
thropic families left.
During- the eleven or twelve years they
are taught as well as our limited means
â¢will permit. Every afternoon upon the
close of the public school, which ail the
larger girls attend, most of them may bo
found mending, darning or learning- to cut
out garments under the tutelage of a
careful instructress. A few hours later,
when the evening meal has been heartily
consumed. many nimble fingers quickly
restore order in the immense dining room
under the guidance of a watchful house
keeper.
People have two wrong- impressions of
the Maria Kip Orphanage. They think
because we- have an imposing building
that we are a rich institution. That is not
so. They also think we take only the chil-
Dr. Worth makes visits to our home to
see thai all is well. At the first intima
tion of trouble the child is bundled off to
the sick ward, where a trained nurse and
the doctor rout the enemy. Once in a
while the whole household comes down
with measles or whopping cough, but they
are babies' diseases and are very seldom
severe.

We have a steam laundry, but even then
it keeps him. busy all the time." The other

The Mary A. Crocker Trust has given
550 monthly, quietly and un.>_eentatiously,
for the past six years, and It Is one of our
mainstays.
The expenses -of the house are paid by
donations from various firms, churches,
people and from the State. What we want
is an assured income, be it great or small.

of the public is, to say the least, an un

The work runs along: harmoniously, as
all are heart and soul in the cause. Thl*

a great strain upon the Orphanage, and
it is nip and tuck to keep all things run

The girls are also taught to cook, notn

"Contented?" said Mrs. Perley; looking
up from the. -book of designs through
which she was searching for one suitable
for an expected student; "don't you think
when one has something to show for., the
efforts , of a lifetime . they would be tho

"It is the most difficult line of work, ex
cept figure painting,' and takes so much
time that it cannot be handled success
fully in class. You see, first the design
has to be traced, then it is fired, then the
colors are, put on and again it is flred.
The coloring and firing is repeated until
each color is' perfect. After the fifth fir
ing the enamel is put on, and it. is then
that I nearly burn my poor old nose off
watching the heat. It must be just so
or the enamel will melt and run off and
hours of work will be-lost.

So says Mrs. Perley.
Students of keramic art In San Fran
cisco owe to "the desire of knowledge
and patience" the existence of the cosy
flat in which they pursue their studies;
Its completeness in its every detail and
tho perfection of the work done.

covered 'with 'Â¦ gold .; work, "those were
taken with the other things." He. almost
cleaned out the shop. We were months
getting them back. The police' found
them In every and any old place. That
tankard yonder was found In a' five-cent

beer barrels. Been sold for 23 cents and
I valued it at the same number of dollars';
Those plates were scattered all over town.
And cups and saucers! One cup and its
saucer were disposed of in different places
and It was two months before we found
them. How the pieces escaped breaking

With a last look at the kiln to see If the

to my forget-me-not.
"Perhaps you won't believe it, but we

Sooner far design a battleship,
t I gazed helplessly at the little dab
of blue paint, the only blemish oa the
otherwise spotless surface of the
palette, then at Mrs. Perley to see if she
really meant it.
The tiny cup I was holding #ot bigger
and bigger: it absolutely refused to stay
etiU and somehow, try as I might, the
brush made nothing but a geometrical de
sign which might be proved anything but
a forret-me-not.
Mrs. Perley is the fair ruler of the Ker
amic Art Etudio at 203 Post street.
My gaze wandered from the table, with
Its miscellaneous assortment of brushes,
bottles, paints and half-finished studies,
around the cosy studio, with its wealth
of curios, its beautifully decorated china
on shelves, on tables and on the walls.

"Getting along all right?"
I started guiltily, nearly dropped the
cup, gazed stupidly at the forget-me-not
âthe beginner's flowciâ and then at my
feeble attempt-
I -aiped it out.

Mrs. Perley laughed heartily, "who came

"There, this !s ready to be flred."
Mrs. Perley laid the pink roses on the
table and began putting the covers on the

"Put in the kiln." she explained, "for
the first firing. Come, I'll show you."
She led the way into a .Back room where
the kilns stood. Two big, important-look
ins: ovens which bespoke of beaten bis

Into the clay-lined Interior Mrs. Perley
put the china, turned on the oil, lighted it
and the fire was started.

"Many others. You see, sometimesâ y<?3,

Different degrees of' heat bring out or
spoil different colors. For instance, pur

while pinks and yellows the most delicate ;
consequently they are lost in the first fir

CATS are by nature dainty, even In
their cruelties. There Is all man
ner of feline grace in the way they
play with mice.\ Cats suffer much
less from constant housing than dog3,
although they run wild much more read
ily, and never quite get over their mur
derous instincts. A cat of fancy breed,
as Maltese. Angora. Conn-eat or JIanx.
is a possession more fashionable than
precious. Each and " several they are
no end decorative, but in affection, in
telligence and playfulness they rank be
low their black, gray, tiger-marked and
tortoise-shell brethren.
"White cats are in general more savaga
and less intelligent than gray or tortoise
shell. Many of them have blue eyes, and
all such are said to be stone deaf, hence
they are less desirable in the house. Un
like dogs, cats require to have their
meat raw, but they must not have too
much of it. Milk should constitute at
least a third of their food. Crumple
stale bread in the milk, and now and
again beat up a raw egg In It. A bit
of raw liver as big as two fingers, or a
flsh head, is meat enough for a day's ra
tions. Supplement it with milk and bread,
or milk and mashed potatoes, a cracker
or two or a bit of hard bread, lightly
buttered, and a few^ small bones, as from
chicken, same or chops.
Cats as well as dogs suffer a plague of '
fle2s. Oddly enough, cat fleas are unllkft
dog fleas, and if the two sorts of in-
sects meet upon one poor beast there i3
a fight to the finish, ending commonly in
victory for the ca^ fleas, which are much
bigger and more voracious than those
found on the dog. If left to ravage un
checked, they soon ,reduce a sleek,
healthy cat to a miserable skeleton, suf
, fering all over from. eczema. To get rid
of the fleas, wash with sulphur soap â
any good brand which the nearest shop
affords â comb out the fleas with a flne
tooth comb . while the hair is still wet,
then rinse the cat well in milk warm
water, dry It with soft towels, and give
It after the bath a saucer of warm milk
with a teaspoonfut of brandy or whisky
in It. A kitten should have only a. few
drops of spirits, and kept snug In a
clean basket for an hour after the bath.
"When the hair is very dry blow in all
alorg ; the backbone some sort of line
insect powderâ either larkspur or pyreth
rin. Hub behind the ears with the sul
phur ointment directed for dogs. Next
day brush out all the powder with a fine,
close brush, comb the coat lightly, then
part it along the backbone, and rub with
the sulnhur ointment.
For mange, rub all over with the sul
phur ointment. Keep the cat confined so
It cannot He in the dirt., and after, twen
ty-four hours wash it well In hot soap
suds â Just comfortably hot, not scalding:
rinse, dry, and leave alone. In three days,
if the mange persists, repeat" the oint
ment, and after the treatment give the
cat plenty of catnip, either green or dry. '
with milk and bread diet. Catnip indeed
ought to be given always twice a. week.
Burn infected bedding, and fumigate

make a special scale for this mill and sign
the same. This was refused and the company
was given to understand that the men in all
the tin mills would be called out, even though
the scale has been signed for all other tin
mills. The privilege requested above would
settle all differences between the tin plate com
pany and the Amalgamated Association.
It was after 6 o'clock to-night when the
members of the executive committee of
the Amalgamated Association filed down
stairs from the conference room. In 'the
Hotsl Lincoln. The members looked un
concerned, and when questioned as to the
result of the day's work declined to say
anything. \ They each referred the in
quirers to President Schaffer, who,- they
said, was still in the conference room.

fact that President Schaffer. had eluded
the newspaper men and had taken a pri
vate exit in departing from the- hotel.
Warner Ames, vice president -of the
American Tin Plate Company, and Voyl
Preston, on behalf of the Steel Hoop Com-,
pany, shortly afterward announced that
.they had but one statement to make re
garding the conference. 1 This was em
bodied in the foregoing communication.
None of the officials of the manufactur

view as to the probable result of , the
strike. They would not estimate the num
ber of men who will go out o"n the order
of President Schaffer and said the facts
in the statements submitted embraced all
that they had to say. As soon as the
workers reached the quarters of the
Amalgamated Association a statement
was prepared for the association side of
the case. * . -
MANY MII/LS ABE AFFECTED.
SchafEer-WillTry to Make the Strike
General as Possible.
PITTSBURG, July 13.â In giving gen
eral details of the effect of the strike that
is now ordered, President Schaffer said
that the first order only went to the mills
of tlfe three companies that have been
carrying on negotiations. It was thought
best that this should be the case.
The orders for the others to be called
out is to follow in a circular letter sent to
every lodge of the Amalgamated Associa
tion in the country where there are mills
of the United States Steel Corporation in
operation, it would Include the mills of
the Federal Steel Company, the mills of
the National Steel Company, the National
Tube Company and wherever there were
organized men employed in non-union
plants of the first-mentioned companies.
He could not give the total number of
men that. would be thus' rendered idle,
but estimated them at 150,000 directly. It
was his intention to have the strlice as
general as possible at the earliest pos
sible moment, so as to force a settlement
of the dispute the quickest way.

The perfection of arms and skill in the use
of them will give the besf assurance of peace.
And that, is what I desire to say,- that no
sane man will go into a war which means the
slaughter of so many human , beings. It is a
terrible thing, but with the perfection of arms
and their use there is very little likelihood, ex
cept for the gravest of causes, of nation going

War is a terrible Â¦â¢ thing. It has ' been said,
"Who preaches war is the devil's chaplain";
and old Sherman said more forcibly than ele

there are occasions on which every drop of
blood in our being and : every fiber dictates a
warlike policy for a nation, - lest it be humili
ated, and lest all the terrors of war be nothing
as compared to the humiliating condition in
which it would be put if it did not pick up the
gage of battle when it. was cast down. We
do not wish to go to Â« war, but .when we are
entered upon: so serious a -business we wish it
to be done expeditiously,;well and conclusively.
Therefore, in the success of American arms in
Manila, just as in the success of American
arms before Santiago, for us it ts a conspicuous
and glorious fact that it\ was due primarily to
the skill of. the marksmen on ioard our men
of-war that the war was decisive, and what
ever horrors there were of the war, they are
abridged and limited by reason of the perfec
tion which our men have attained In the use
of weapons of precision. (Applause.), It was
a most remarkable thing m the history of war
fare.that battles should be waged in which the
bloodshed was all upon one side, and that great
armaments were engaged in .fierce conflict, and'
an enemy older and more seasoned in the
usages of war should be beaten to silence by
a foe unused, -you might say, to war, but who
was accustomed to the uto or firearms in the
gentle pursuits of life, simply at target ' prac
tice. The United States never engaged in a
warfare within our recollection in which they
were called upon to use weapons of high pre
cision, such as have been invented \ and per
fected since ' the civil war, great guns^-those
great guns, "which make ambition virtue." says
the poet we were unaccustomed to, and yet
that new learning, the making of the steel ship
and the making of the perfected rifle, we went
into, and engaged with one of the oldest coun
tries of the world, and signally achieved a vic
tory. This >ls due to the fact that the men
behind the guns knew how to use these modern
weapons-more than to the guns themselves-
and that they attained their skUI by practice
at targets, both on land and on sea, and when
they engaged In war they knew exactly what
they were about. Â¦ Â¦

Hospitality of Calif orniaus.
After the long, and we may, notwithstanding
the luxurious character of travel, say, after an
irksome trip across the continent, it must be
pleasing to their eyes to behold the fertile
plains of California, and when they arrive at
the great Bay City, the metropolis of the Pa
cific, to behold the waters of the largest ocean
on this globe stretching away to v the far-off
east And wherein -has California acquired a
reputation for hospitality? I can see two rea
aone why our fame, with little effort of our
own, has established itself: because, in the
first place, nature has been kind beyond the
expression , of words In conferring upon this
State, in mountain and in valley which gladden
the eyes and please all the senses, and the sky
above, always benignant, looks down upon the
Inhabitants of this favored country, not with
the severity of winter's cold nor with the tor
rid heat of middle summer in the East. We
read in the East to-day that the people, with
out any fault of their own, those who must
labor in shops and in the field, are stricken by
the deadly heat, and never in - this favored
land are our people exposed to such hardships.
In fact the only hardships which they do feel
are those which they impose upon themselves,
though they do not so regard it. They are the
labors which they are constantly engaged i in
In preparing a welcome for their Eastern
.neighbors; but "the labor we delight in physics
pain," and if the heart is in the work it adds
its grace unto. every part. Californians seem
to me to be always happy when they are mak
ing welcome their friends. -.'Â¦*Â¦ , "' â¢
Mr. President and distinguished guests, and
fellow citizens: San Francisco Is so remote

Nervous, thin-blooded, run-down - people should bear In
mind that drugs I and stimulants * cannot furnish good blood,

condition resulting from a neglected cold in the head, whereby
the lining membrane of the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge - therefrom jj passing | backward into ; the
throat reaches the stomach, thus producing catarrh of the stom-
ach. Medical authorities prescribed for me for three years for
catarrh of stomach without cure; but to-day I am the happiest
of men after using only one box of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

Since X learned of the merits of Stuart's Tablets I keep them in
my desk or carry them ln my pocket, and find j that I can eat
anything at all without discomfort. They were recommended
to me by a friend who is enthusiastic In their praise. I cannot
afford to be drowsy after lunch, and find these tablets just the
thing to assist digestion and keep all my faculties wide awake."
The Rev. F. I. Bell, a highly esteemed minister residing hi
Â¦Weedsport, Cayuga Co., N. Y., in a recent letter writes as fol-
lows: "There has never been anything that I have taken that
has relieved tbe dyspepsia from which I have suffered for ten
years except the new remedy called Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Since taking them I hava had no distress at all after eating
and again after long years can sleep well. : Sev. F. I. Bell,

6ee any symptoms of indigestion I take one, also one after each
meal, and for a year and a half I have not lost a day by reason
of poor health and can eat anything and relish what I eat; my
digestion' Is absolutely perfect as far as I can judge from my
feelings and although there may be other stomach medicines
]ust as good as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, I do not know what
they are. Certainly for people who travel they are far ahead of
I any liquid medicine, as they are so convenient, they can bo
carried ln the pocket and used whenever needed."
because It directly Interested me; and at the next town I in.
quired at tbe first drag store and bought a package for fifty
cents, and from that day to this I have nover been without
them. They are pleasant tasting tablets, not a secret patent
medicine but composed of vegetable essences, pure pepsin,
fruit salts and Golden Seal; being in tablet form they never lose
their good qualities like a liquid medicine would, but are always
fresh and ready for use. -
Every Man Must Be That to Retain His
Haafth and Digestion.
There are- thousands of people in t!z!s world who eat no meat
from one year's end to another, and certain savage tribes in Af-
rica and PolT&asla are almost exclusively meat eaters; but
while there are thousands of these, there are millions who lira
upon a mixed diet of meat, vegetables and grains and if num-
bers Is a criterictn it would seem that a mixed diet Is the best
for the human f amlly.
Tbe. fact thnt you will find many vegetarians who appear
healthy and vigorous and many meat eaters equally so, and any
number of robust specimens who eat both meat and vegetables
and anything else tbat comes their way all goes to show that
the old saw Is the true one, that every man must be a law to
himself as to -what Jve shall eat and drink.
To repair the waste of tissue in brain workers as well as to
replace the muscle and sinew of the laborer, can only be done
through the process of digestion. '
Every serve, m-scle, sinew, every iropof blood Is extracted
from the food we eat and digest. - . '
In these days of hustle and worry,' and artificial habits of
life, scarcely one person ln a thousand can lay claim to a per"
feet digestion; d?spepÂ£a is a national affliction and Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets a national blessing.
Most cases of poor digestion are caused by failure of the
stomach to secrete sufficient gastric Juice, or too little Hydro-
Chloric add and lack of peptones and all of these important es-
sentials to perfect digestion are found In Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets ln convenient palatable form.
One or two of these tablets taken after meals Insure perfect
digestion and assimilation of the food. !
Cathartic pills and laxative medicines have no effect what-
ever In digesting food and to call such remedies a cure for
dyspepsia 1Â» far fetched and absurd.* " ' , -
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain pepsin free from animal
matter, diastase and other digestives, and not only digest all
wholesome food but tend to increase the flow of gastric Juices
and by giving the weak stomach a much needed rest bring about
a healthy condition of the digestive organs and a normal ap-
petite. /.?;>
Mr. E. W. Wlncherdon, a commercial traveler from Birm-
ingham, whose business keeps him almost, constantly on the
road, relates ln tbe Sunday News the dangers to health result-
ing from constant change cf residence and the way he over-
came the usual injurious effects.
He says : "One thing people traveling cannot very well avoid
Is the constant change In water and food; the stomach never
has an opportunity to become accustomed to anything and in a
few yeara or much sooner the average traveling man becomes
a hopeless dyspeptic.
"For several years I suffered more or less from Indigestion,
sour stomach, headaches, distaste for food, often no appetite,
gas on the stomach and the usual unpleasant effects of Imper-
fect digestion.
"Nearly every traveling man has his favorite remedy for dif-
ferent trouble* and I tried all of them with indifferent results.
Finally on the train between Pittsburg and Philadelphia one
day, I overheard a conversation between two ladles, one of
whom had suffered severely from Indigestion and stated she

SACRAMENTO. July 13.-Margaret
Cooke, aged and hopelessly blind, has in
stituted in the Superior Court a contest of
the will of her deceased son, Thomas M.
Cooke, asserting that . he was induced
through undue Influence to > part' with his
property. Cooke owned in the rich Sacra
mento River section a ranch worth $8000.'
Some time ago, needing ready money, he
borrowed $300 from William H. Curry of
Nord, Butte County,; giving as security an
absolute deed tc his ranch. . Soon after
ward Illness necessitated his departure
for the dry climate of Tucson, Ariz.
It Is alleged in the proceedings brought
to-day that Curry followed ' Cooke to
Tucson; that he Induced him to return
with him to San Francisco and there en
ter a private hospital, and that while
there . and undor the influence of strong
drugs Curry prevailed -upon him to make
a' will in his 1 * favor, confirming the trans
fer of his ranch and giving Curry all he
possessed. The- will named William H.
Schooler, an attorney of San Francisco,
formerly of Chico, as executor. It was
filed ohortly after Cookc's death in May.
It is averred in Mrs. Cooke's complaint
that her son induced her to come to Sac
ramento to live with him; that their rela
tions had been s.uch as became a mother
pnd son, and that he often remarked that
he intended to leave her his estate. It is
alleged that Si?hocler, the executor, is a
friend of Curry, but- he is not cnargred
with having had any wrongful connection
with tbe transaction. It is declared that
at present Mrs. Cooke is penniless.

LACK OF MOTIVE POWER SPOILS
SECOND TRIAL OF THE AIRSHIP
. Lands in a Tree.
A cumber of spectators had congregated
on the platform of the Eiffel tower to
watch the trial. They cheered the balloon-
prise of 100,000 francs offered by
Henry Deutsch for a manageable balloon
before a committee of the Aero Club to
day. Starting from the Pare de Meudon,
he reached the Eiffel Tower in a quarter
of an hour, and after sailing around the
tower started to return to the Pare de
Meudon. but lack of motive power neces
sitated a descent at Boulogne-sur-Seine.
The condition of the winning of the
Deutsch prize is that the trip from St.
Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back must
be made in half an hour.
Santos-Dumont started at 7:40 a. m. He
reached the Eiffel Tower in fifteen min
utes, turned around it and had begun his
return trip, when the motor failed and
the aeronaut ripped the silk of his bal
loon, fearing disaster unless he could
quickly reach the ground. The balloon
pitched forward headforemost into a
clump of trees on the Rothschild estate
near Boulogne, where it was caught and
suspended In the branches on the oppo
site side of the Seine from, the starting
point. Santos-Dumont was not hurt.

machinery, as the balloon was seen to
turn partly over on- its side. ,, It is calcu
lated that but for the accident the trip
from the Pare de Meudon around the
tower and back would have been a com
plete success and would have been accom
plished in fifty minutes. Santos-Dumont,
as he climbed down from the tree where
his balloon caught, was questioned as to
what had. occurred. He said; . f
"My motor was badly regulated and
suddenly refused to act when I was pre
paring to descend. I saw at once that un
less some action was promptly taken the
balloon would be carried away by the
wind. So I ripped the silk in order -to
come down immediately. All had gone
well on my trip up to that moment. I did
not succeed entirely this time, but I hape
to be more fortunate with my next at
tempt. I am not bruised or hurt in any
way."
Consternation Prevails.
A . few more Â¦ moments would have
brought Santos-Dumont safely back to
his port of , departure, when suddenly the
balloon stopped short and its screws
ceased to revolve. Consternation pre
vailed among the members of the Aero
Club committee and the crowd, and some
one exclaimed, "He is done for."
The balloon, however, was carried slow
ly by the breeze toward the grounds of the
Aero Club, and subsequently it was blown
back to Boulogne, where the aerial trav
eler ripped its silken sides and descended

Santos-Dumont will resume his attempt

the review will be the presence of the
members of the Moorish mission, attired
in striking Oriental costuwies. There will
participate for the first time a company of
military cyclists, who have just ridden to
Parts from Sedan in three days. They
ride specially -made bicycles, .which can bÂ«
folded in thirty seconds and carried on the
backs of the men. They will march past
President Loubet, first with their bicycles
on their backs and the*n mounted.
The spell of sultry weather which has
prevailed for a week past was broken by
a heavy hailstorm this afternoon and to
night the weather is fine and cool. The
terraces in front of the cafes are crammed
with holiday-makers. There will be a
children's fete, open-air games and other
amusements in the working quarters to
morrow and displays of fireworks will.be
given and music and dancing will be re
sumed in the evening. The festivities will
be continued Monday, â¢â¢which, although
the' authorities have refused to declare it
an official fete day, it will be kept as a
holiday by most Parisians. - v
PARIS, July 13.â Paris Is gayly beÂ«
flagged to-night in anticipation of the na
tional fete to-morrow, the anniversary ot
the Fall of the Bastile. Throughout tha
city, particularly in the middle and work
ing classes, open-air bills, are being held
in almost every square* and cross-street,
where band stands have been erected.
Th6se in central positoins, such as tha
Opera square and the Place de la Bourse,
are elaborately decorated with bunting
and Chinese lanterns, while in the poorer
quarters a few planks placed on barrels
or a wagon dra pea with national colors oj
ornamented with a half dozen lanterns
serve as a stand for a scratch orchestra,
around which workingmen and their fan>
ilies dance the night long.

While scientists are puzzling their brains
to find out the cause, each individual can,
by a little precaution* avoid the chances
of contracting dreaded and dangerous
kidney trouble, or eradicate it completely
from their system if already af Aicted.
Many precious lives might have been, and
many more can yet be saved, by paying
attention to the kidneys.
It is the mission of The Call to benefit
its readers at ' every opportunity and,
therefore, we advise all who have any
symptoms of kidney or bladder trouble to
write to-day to Dr. Kilmer & Co.. Bing-
hamton, N. Y., for a free sample bottla
of Swamp-Root, the celebrated specino
which Is having such a great demand
and remarkable success in the euro of tho
most distressing kidney and bladder
troubles. With the sample bottle of
Swamp-Root will also be sent free a pam-
phlet and treatise of valuable informa-
tion.
To-day -we see a relative, a friend or an
acquaintance apparently veil *Â¦ and in a
few days we may be grieved to learn of
their serious illness or sudden death,
caused by that fatal type of kidney trou-
bleâ Bright's disease.
- Kidney trouble often becomes advanced
into acute stages before the afflicted Is
aware of its presence; that is why wa
read of so n?any sudden deaths of promi-
nent business and professional men, phy-
sicians and others. They have neglected
to stop the leak in time.
At no time in the history of disease has
there been such an alarming increase in
the number of cases of any particular
malady as in that of kidney and bladder
troubles now preying upon the people of
this country.

Dr. Pierce's Golden' Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and , nutrition. It
cures diseases . of lungs, heart, liver, and

Smelters Will Resume Work.
BUTTE. Mont, July 13.â After being
idle for six weeks on account of differ
ences with employes over the elpht-hour
question the Colorado smelter will start
to-morrow with a full force of men. Tha
trouble arose over the demand of tho
smelter men that the outside men. In
cluding machinists, should receive tha
benefit of the eight-hour law. The com
pany, not being willing to concede thia.
closed down the works. The men will go
to work on the old arrangement, by which
all men actually employed in the work of
smelting get eight hours a day at tha
wages formerly paid for ten.
In India and Persia sheep are used aa
beasts of burden.
The Kansas. City livestock market la an
index to the situation. The livestock mar
ket has gone through one of the most try
ing weeks ln many years. As many, feed
ers as possible are holding back their cat
tle in the hope that rain will come. Each
day. however, brings them to the inevita
ble and the commission men are flooded
with letters Indicating that next week is
the longest they can hold out. Ruling
Â¦prices are. the !owest in many years, and
during the last few days the commoner
grades of stock cattle could not be sold at
any prices.

There is no relief in sight and the situ
ation becomes worse each hour. Prayer
for rain will be heard | in . scores of
churches in Missouri and Kansas to-mor

The atmosphere la heated to such a great

.KANSAS CITT, July 13.â Despite local
thunderstorms, accompanied by slight
rainfalls in Western Missouri last night,
the drought that is burning up vegetation
in Missouri, .Kansas, Oklahoma and In
dian Territory is still unbroken. The Kan
sas City weather bureau observer says:
Much sickness is resulting from the
scarcity of good water. .. Boiling the
water will not remove the disease germs
with which it is infected, so low i3 the
supply.
Reports from the country districts tell
that all the streams are getting runs.
Mills and electric light plants that were
run by water power have been forced to
close. Most of the ponds have been dry
for two weeks and the. question of where
Much. Sickness Results.
The firÂ© departments in Topeka, Atchi
son, Emporla. Lawrence and other of the
larger cities have addressed appeals to
the people asking them to shut off all
their hydrants whenever the fire whistle
is blown, so as to give the proper amount
of pressure on the water mains leading to
the flres. There is not a city ln the otate
which is to-night able to cope with a fire.
Buildings have reached such an intense
degree of dryness that a fire will start on
the slightest' provocation and once start
ed Id some part of the cities, enormous
losses would be sure to ensue.
People do not now expend so much time
ln worrying about the loss of the crops
and the hard times which must of neces
sity comeâ they are devoting all their
energies to the exigencies of the. present.
With water works systems givlrtg out. Ice
famines threatened, and .farm products of
all kinds obtaining large prices, the sit
uation is' becoming a serious one for Kan
sas. \ Â¦ i- Â» -
A Topeka special says: The suffering
in Kansas from the prolonged drought 13
now more intense than ever. The skies
are leaden and the sun's heat is intense.
No immediate relief is expected. It is the
opinion of some who experienced the
drought of 1860 that the present dry period
promises to be even more severe. It is
hardly expected that there will be any
lasting relief before fall.
Great Suffering in Kansas.
Unless rain comes the supply may be still
greater next week. -
The livestock situation Is very Jsad.
Dairymen have been obliged to double the
price of milk, so high have the prices of
feed become.
Reports from twenty-four Kansas coun
ties to-night, mostly in the eastern and
central parts of the State, indicate that
the corn crop is not so bad off as ha 3
hitherto been published. The late product
has not yet begun to tassel and It is thÂ©
general verdict that it i3 standing the
heat remarkably well. In some places the
corn is worse off than in others, but tak
ing It on an average of aJl the conditions
reported, it can be safely said that If
favorable weather conditions' would coma
at once half a crop of corn would be ob
tained. But the conditions now are any
thing but propitious for better weather.
to obtain -water for stock Is one of the
most important propositions that ha3 con
fronted the Kansas farmer for years.
As a result stock is being placed on sale
at ridiculously low prices. Some have
said they would even give their stock
away if some relief did not come soon, as
to purchase feed for the animals would be
investing more money than they are
worth.

I am a native of France. I came to this

am 8. Journeyman tailor and "work at 116 Mont-
gomery street, this city. I have been a great
sufferer from catarrh of the head, throat and
stomach. I have consulted many doctors and
so-called specialists for my trouble, but their
treatment did me no. good. In fact, I became
greatly reduced and feared I never would be-
come well again., My nose would stop up so at
night it Interfered much with my sleep, and I
became very nervous. I lost my appetite and
strength. This -was _iny condition when I
came to Drs. Shores & Shores JUST . ONE
MONTH AGO. I can truthfully say Drs.
Shores' treatment and medicines helped me
from the start. My appetite Is good; my ner-
vousness ia gone, and I sleep good now. The
catarrh in my head is much improved, and I
feel better in every way. I feel that ln a
short time Drs. Shores', treatment will entirely
cure me, and I heartily recommend Drs. Shores

The Supervisors, sitting as a Board of
Equalization, adopted "razooing" tactics,
as Braunhart put it. yesterday in the
case of tax-dodgers who Ignored the
Bubpenas to appear before the board and
Ebow cause why their arbitrary assess-'
znents should riot be raised. - In most in
6tanc.es the assessments â¢were doubled by
way of penalty and education in the
duties of citizensKlD.
Since the sessions of the Board of
Equalization, assessments have been re
duced $2,030,000. The Supervisors felt that
eorae part of that amount might *be added
again to the rolls with advantage at the
expense of Indifferent citizens who appar- â¢
ently regarded themselves as lucky to es
cape "with the assessments fixed by Dodge, i
J. B. Relnstein, attorney and regent of .
the University of California, was one of
the first to be penalized. Assessor Dodge
had placed an arbitrary assessment of i
$51WO on his personal property. He ignored
the board's subpena and his assessment
was doubled.
P. N. Lilienthal will pay taxes on an as
sessment of $30,000 for personal property
Instead of 510,000, as tixed by the Assessor. ,
Charles S. Wheeler's assessment was
raised from $10,000 to $15,000.
Assessments That Were Raised.
r Homer S. King, manager of the Wells-
Kargro Bank, was assessed $6000 arbitrar
ily. He stayed away and the figure was
raised to $10,000.
J. H. Follis and R. J. Kerr & Co.. will
each pay taxes on 35000, double the
amount of the assessment-
Joseph B. Crockett will have to raise
enough ready money to pay taxes on an
arbitrary personal property tax of $4000.-
Dodge had fixed the assessment at $2900.
James G. Magrulre. holding: consistently
to single tax, ignored the subpena. and
his assessment was raised from $1500 to
J2500. Maguire & Gallagher suffered an
increase from $1000 to $1390, but Walter
Gallagher had the satisfaction of getting
a reduction to $16,000 from an assessment
of $19,000 upon the clubrooms on Sacra
mento street of the Yeong Wa Associa
tionâcne of the Chinese Six Companies.
Other arbitrary personal property as-
Btfcsnients were raised as follows:
Sullivan & Sujlivan, from $5000 to $6000:
Louis Meyerstein, from $2000 to $3000; Mr?.
S. Seymour, from $1500 to $2500; John A.
"Wright, from $1500 to $3000; Crittenden
Thornton, from $1501 to $250); H. F. Lally.
from 51500 to $2590; M. Ostrosky. from 51500
to S2500; A. V. Morrison, from $1500 to
$2500: H. Duncan, from $1500 to $2500; W.
H. Daly. $1000 to $1500; William Bradford,
from $2500 to $3500.
Crocker Estate Overlooked.
An arbitrary personal property tax of
$217,750 on the Crocker estate was author
ized. Assessor Dodge had overlooked the
estate, and no statement had been filed.
The H. E. Huntlngton assessment of
$1,000,000 was allowed to stand. The cor
responding assessment last year Â¦was but
$80(K>. The following assessments "also
werÂ«Â» left unchanged:
Rudolph Spreckels, $70,000; W. H.
Crocker. $60.0o0; W. G. Irwin. $27,000; R.
E. Queen. J1S.120; Robert Oxnard, $10,182;
J. M. McDonald, $10,000.
Charles Mattheas. the cigar dealer, who
had a wrangle with Assessor Dodge be
fore the board last year, appeared again,
asking- that his assessment be reduced
from $22,490 to $16,000. He had his book
keeper along, but Dodge objected to the
presentation of evidence that had persist
ently been denied the Assessor's depu
ties.
Mattheas was in choleric mood, and
raid he did not care whether his
assessment were raised or lowered,
but he was not going to be abused nor
to stand before the board and be accused
of dishonesty. Finally Deputy Assessor
Ginty Â¦was instructed to examine the bal
ance sheets presented by Mattheas. He
did so and reported that the cigar man
â¢was entitled to a reduction to J2L.S34 in
stead of to $16,000. The reduction was
made.
The Armour Packing Company's fran
chise assessment of $10,000 was not can
celed, the company's application being
denied.
The board will meet at 10 o'clock to
morrow morning to complete its work.

leaning* toward the stage. In "Privata

Los Angelesâ G. Hockwell, at the Gil

J. C Spruam, at the Holland.
NEW YORK. July 13.â The following
Calif ornians have arrived: San Francisco
â B. L. Dow and wife, at the Imperial;
Miss V. Foltz, at the Victoria; Mrs. M. A.
Greenwood, at the Imperial; W. G. Mc-
Carthy, at the Earlington; D. E. Newell,
at the Albert; J. H. Reid, J. Reid Jr., J.
Reid and wife, at .the Grand Union; F.
Shaly, at the Ashland.
Calif oroians in New 'York.
The organ, by the way, is not the least
notable of the features of the convention.
It is the new memorial instrument pre
sented by Mrs. Jane L. Stanford to Stan
ford University, and desUned to occupy
a permanent place in the college chapel.
It has been very kindly lent to the Ep
worth League by Mrs. Stanford and has
come right from the organ shop to San
Francisco. The instrument has a patriot
ic as well as an artistic value, being the
work of a Californlan organ builder, Mur
ray M. Harris of Â£os Angeles, and Is, I
believe, the fim electrical, organ built
west of Chicago. It is an excellent speci
men of the organ builder's art, the most
ambitious product so far of home talent
in this direction, and is the promise and
portent of development here of a highly
Important industry- The organ is large,
with three manuals and forty-six stops,
thus divided: On the great organ, thir
teen; swell organ, fifteen; choir, nine, and
pedat. nine. There Is an ample variety "of
tone and color, a good volume, excellent
balance and admirable mechanical action
It Is most probable that the Epworth
League chorus singing will be of the kind
that is worth hearing. Long practice has
gone to the study of the choruses, there
are 1300 voices in the choir and a good or
gan to back up the vocal volume. There
will be sung on Tuesday evening next at
the Pavilion "The Heavens Are Telling,"
"Gloria" from Mozart's "Twelfth Mass,"
"Thanks Be to God," "Be Not Afraid,"
"By Babylon's Wave," "Worthy Is the
Lamb" and to conclude with the "Halle
lujah Chorus." There Is but one thing
lackingâ the usual lackâ that , of a sym
phony orchestra to add to the orchestral
coloring. But the organ will- go far to
remedy the deficiency In the capable
hands of W.'F. Skeele of Los Angeles and
"William B. Kin? of Oakland, who will ac
company the choruses, and also give solos
on the new Instrument.
It is Impossible to overestimate the hu
manlzing-^plritualizing, if you like it
betterâ influence of this form of- musical
expression both on listener and singer.
There is a vastness of 'result, a breadth
of emotional reach never otherwise ob
tained. Heaven is touched and earth's
utmost sounded as the great common
chord of worship or lament is set vibrat
ing. Each singer feels the God of his
fathers praised by the thousand throats
of his fellow choristers, each listener the
joy and grief of his world sung to heaven
by lips opened for him alone. Most truly
do' these things make for the brotherhood
of man, and â but. I never meant to be be
guiled into sermonizing this gracious Sun
day morning!
Beethoven felt this. In his last, and
largely held to be his greatest symphony,
to the wealth of orchestral beauty he
added the human voice, with what mag
nificent largeness of result is known to all
hearers of the "Choral Symphony." More
familiarly felt because more widely
known Is the effect of the great oratorio
choruses, many of which we shall have
the privilege of hearing during the comr
ing week from the Epworth League sing
ers.
TO the Epworth Leaguers, Chris
tian Endeavorers and other oon
ventionersâto keep the English up
to pitchâ San Francisco ' owes
it gets in the way of
the large choral festival, a debt, look you,
cf no mean proportions. Since old King
Solomon's time (who, according to Jo
sephus. numbered two hundred thousand

In a dead level State, where the seasons change at the same time throughout its area, one
game law may apply to all parts, but it is not so here, either 'as to feathered or four-footed
animals.
THE Marysville Democrat assumes that the Call opposes the protection of:fish and game
because we question the wisdom of .a. law which destroys allfish and game found on hand
the first day of the close season. Such' a regulation destroys food and causes a loss to the
dealer. Precautions against accumulating a surplus stock in cold storage are just as easy
as the tagging of such legitimate surplus as a dealer may carry over in the ordinary course of trade.
Game laws should be rigid and rigidly enforced. It is even well to have laws that forbid
entirely the taking of deer and large game for a period of three or five years, in order that it may
multiplicand then the open season be thereafter limited, and killing restricted to the male
animals. â¢.
It would be well if Legislatures would consult naturalists in the fixing of the open and
close season for game. In California the altitude of our mountains counts for latitude, and the
season of breeding has a wide range. A law that permits the shodting of deer and birds in the
valleys is not applicable at the same date to the whole State. When spring is advanced and it is
even summer in the valleys, the vernal season has not opened in the mountains.- The present
arrangement of the deer law permits the killing of deer at a season wkjen the venison is not fit J:'o
eat, so that all taken is wasted, and the animals are practically killed for their hides. At the sea
son when the venison is fit to eat, it cannot be taken without penalty. This misplacing of the
shooting season does not preserve the deer, as the great bales of dried hides sold in this city
prove.
The same criticism applies to the dove season. For years it has opened while the birds
are still nesting. The result has been a great decrease in that game. The opening has now been
set forward to August, which is* an improvement.
To return fo the deer season, prohibition of the sale of venison and of export from the
county where taken has turned deer hunting into hide hunting. The limitation of the season's
hunt to. three deer per hunter is entirely ineffective, since there is no way of proving that more
are taken, and the hunter is not likely to turn informer "on himself. As has been frequently said
our deer law is intended for an exclusive few, "or to profit the hide hunter. The Legislature
should consult naturalists and intelligent hunters in the different zones of altitude, and they
would then prepare a law that would run not by county lines, but according to altitude, as the
natural seasons go. Its effect would be to really preserve the, game and permit the best us.e of
that which is taken. \

"Well, - it is an old story now, Â¦ how the
Japanese actors played for three cents a
performance at the beginning of the Paris
Exposition, and ended at eight francs,
with Bernhardt * and Kejane everyday
spectators of their efforts. But we had
the first hearing and sight of the unique
entertainment, and gave the first god
speed to the quaint company.

But one thing out of key was there, the
unspeakable singing of the De Reszke of
Japan, Fujita, Of all amazing, hair-rais
ing and incomprehensible performances
that It has been my lot to hear, that was
the worst, and so far as that goes the
Englishman's attitude is readily under
stood â one is tempted to believe, indeed,
that the London performance began with
Fujita, and could readily sympathize with
the critic If for him it had ended there.
Fortunately for us Fujita came late on
the programme. The audience had settled
down Into an inspired politeness of at
tention, suggested by a printed slip with
minute directions for the etiquette of the
affair, and had just attained a soothing
belief in itself as a model of manners
that even the most hypercritical maid of
Nippon could find no flaw in, when Fu
jita happened along. It was the sudden
ness of the affair. Into the cherry-blos
som daintiness and grace the little brown
grotesque dropped like a frog in a bou
quet of butterflies, and the newly acquired
manners of the audience took rapid
flight It hid behind its shrieking neigh
bor, stuffed its handkerchief . into its
mouth in a vain attempt to smother Its
Olympic laughter, as Fujita howled and
squealed and squirted out his gong. But
just the same the song had the artistic
value of the grotesque, and only made the
Japanese introduction to the West the
more nationally characteristic.
Not that it matters, for the quaint lit
tle company that we first greeted here on
one never to be forgotten night in June,
'99, at Maple Hall in the Palace Hotel,
has received its full meed of sympathy
and appreciation since that time. To any
one present at that Vsach-blossom festi
val, that correct, ridiculous and charming
affair, the future success of Madame Sada
and her company in Paris was a, foregone
conclusion. The whole thing was as cer
tainly and conventionally artistic as a
Hiroshlgo drawing, with the same inspired
and weird perspective, the same absolute
loveliness of line and the same auda
cious brilliance of color. From the geisha
dance of Madame Yacco, an absolute
music of movement, in which the slim,
brilliant figure fitted, half bird-like, half
like a butterfly against the still gold of
the black edged screen behind, to the
delicate melancholy of the symphonies of
Japan played on the saaiisen and koto,
and the crowning grace of the quaint
ceremonies of the Chanoyuâ the ancient
festival of the tea-drinkingâ the Japanese
greeting to the West was a keen, artistic
delight.
OUR Captious Critic" in the Lon
don Sporting and Dramatic
News, this week, falls afoul of
that charming: little tea-house
lady, Sada Yacco. whose first
acquaintance with the stern world on the
other side of the jade and pearl screen
was made some two years ago In San
Francisco. Sada Yacco and Otto Kawa
kami, the Ellen Terry and Irving of
Japan, have recently been doing the
drama as she is done in Japan for the
benefit of Criterion patrons in London,
and the critic caps his captlousness by a
refusal to see good of any kind In the
efforts of these stars of the Oriental
stage. Gcod, that Is. according to Occi
dental standards, and that there may be
others he seems to find difficult of be
lief. Even for the music and dancing of
these jewels of Asia he finds no word of
praise, but the doubtful appreciation
"that it may be simply perfect in Japan,
but that I feel that I should need to be
a Japanese to enjoy it," an attitude
neither wise nor logical.
BAFFLED in their efforts, to obtain- control of the machinery of the Republican party, and
seeing defeat of all then- political schemes staring them in the face, the bosses, who
for so long a ' time have done politics for profit in this city , have now in their despera
tion turned to the Republican State Committee for assistance. , * It is their desire to get
the State Committee to recognize their so-called County Committee ; as the body legally author
ized to present to the Board of Election Gommissioners on the part of the Republicans of San
Francisco a plan for apportionment of delegates to the approaching convention.
In these efforts the bosses have been so far successful that the chairman of the State Com
mittee has been induced to consent to issue a call for a meeting of that body. An jssue is there
fore raised which, it behooves the members 'of the committee to study carefully. The gentle
men who compose the committee are to be called from their counties to interfere in the local
politics of San Francisco: There is no State; question involved in the campaign, nor is any State
officer to be voted for at the election. Such controversies as exist are matters of what is strictly
and exclusively San Francisco politics. Why then should the State Committee be called upon to
decide them?
It is to be borne in mind there has been established by law. a Board of Election Commis
sioners to settle any questions of this kind that may. arise. The board is a part of the political
machinery of San Francisco, and the members of it are much/better fitted to.deal with local con
troversies than are any set of men drawn from the State at large. There* is no reason why men
should come from their homes, in far-away Modoc, or even from the nearness of Alameda. to
interfere in San Francisco politics, any more than that San Francisco politicians should inter
pose "in the politics of those counties.
While there are no reasons to justify interference on the part of the State Committee
there are several good reasons why it should not interfere. In the first place by such action the
State Committee would be involved in a broil from which it could not derive credit and might
emerge with discredit that would seriously affect its efficiency in matters that rightly belong to it.
The outsider who interposes in a family quarrel never gets thanks for his pains. In the second
place such interference from outsiders would probably disgust- many of the more independent
members of the Republican party and thus endanger the whole ticket. ... It will hardly be denied
by any sane man. that the American people resent outside interference with local, affairs, and such
interference in San Francisco on the part of the Republican State Committee would go far toward
bringing about a Democratic victory.
Finally, the State Committee should bear in mind this, plain, fact â there is no controversy
among the Republicans of San Francisco; they are united and harmonious. The controversy
that has been carried to the committee is ope raised by Martin Kelly and Phil Crimmins, sup
ported and assisted by W. F: Herrin,\ John C. Lynch, Jere Burke and other employes of the
Southern Pacific Railroad. Not one of these men is in any sense a genuine Republican. They are
in politics for what they can make out of it, and are even now scheming with Democratic bosses
to do politics together. The claim of such men to control the Republican organization is
so shamelessly impudent that it. is not entitled to a 'moment's consideration.
The activity of the Southern Pacific officials and employes in supporting men like Crim
mins and Kelly is in violation of the orders issued by President Hays, and he should certainly
give his attention to it. If that. order is not to be looked upon as a farce it should be promptly
enforced. t> â¢

BERLIN, July 13.â In the complete
absence of other political Interests , this
week/ the great trial at Posen of the thir
teen Polish students charged with be
longing to secret political societies at vari
ous German universities, organized' to
promote the national aspirations of Po
land, attracts much attention. ;Â¦
The examination of the accused students
has not, up to the present time, developed
any sensational features. They all deny
the charges of participating knowingly In
illegal societies. The most sensational
feature of this trial so far has been the
throwing up of their briefs by the leading
lawyers for the defense, protesting
against the rigid limitations prescribed
for them by the court." ,
In connection with the trial the German
newspapers print articles concerning the
Polish National Fund at Rapperschwyl,
Switzerland, which was collected chiefly
among American Pole3. This fund now
amounts to about $46,000 and continues to
grow rapidly. The newspapers, referring
to the matter, say:
"The purpose of this fund, as stated
by the Polish managing committee, is that
it be used at a given moment, with all its
power, In support of a decision for po
litical action." The official publications of
those having in hand the collection of this
fund say the only institution openly work
ing for the Independence of Poland is "the
national fund."
Other developments of the last week
Indicate further Polish activity. Besides
the decision of the German authorities to
prosecute the sixty Polish students at
Thorl, in West Prussia, charged also with
being connected with Polish political or
ganizations, the Polish voters In the bye
electlon at Duisburg, on the Rhine, re

unless a pledge was given to support the
idea of holding Polish religious service

Governor General Wood Improves.
HAVANA, July 13.âGovernor General
Wood, who is suffering from typhoid fev
er, has recuperated wonderfully and his
physicians are confident he will be able to
get up in a'few days.
Officials of the War Office are more wor
ried now than at any previous time dur
ing the war, and they are working stren
uously to. explain the mistake. The inci
dent has awakened in the public mind an
eagerness, most unfortunate for the Gov
ernment, to know the details of opera
tions and an everlasting and ever-Increas
ing dissatisfaction with the progress of
the British army in South Africa. Â¦
Amid the storm of disapproval of the
Vlakfontein affair and which the Govern
ment supporters are pouring out on the
War Office on account of the suppression
of news and the flagrant vagaries of the
censorship, the Liberal party, through its
hopeless differences of opinion, is obliged
to sit stupidly- and see the best oppor
tunity ever afforded pass out of its hands.
The extraordinary spectacle has been pre
sented of an advance radical newspaper,
the Daily News, patting the War Office
and Lord Kitchener on the back for sup
pressing the story of alleged Boer out
rages to British wounded, while the
Times and other Government, though less
radical, organs, like- them say the feeling
aroused In the general public, who have
up. to this time blindly and enthusiastic
ally supported the Government's war pol
icy, can scarcely be estimated.
There is little doubt that Lord Mil
ner and Lord Kitchener have had several
disagreements and the High Commissioner
does not want to return to South Africa
as long as the hard, high-handed General
Kitchener remains in control there.
LONDON, July 13.â The Vlakfontein in
cident has come near to spelling Water
loo for the Government. An apparently
unimportant incident, the censorship of
one- of the newspaper dispatches, has had
the effect. of crystallizing all the widely
differentiating^sorts of public dissatisfac
tion concerning the conduct of the war in
South Africa. This dissatisfaction has
long been pent up and now finds free
vent, not, strangely enough, through the
columns of the opposition newspapers, but
In the Government journals.
For months past the public belief in and
admiration for Lord Kitchener has been
waning and by some he is openly and
severely criticized. A rumor which can
not be substantiated is current that he
will shortly be succeeded in the command
of the British forces in South Africa by
General Sir Bindon Blood, who has been
operating in the Eastern Tran3vaal.
Should this change occur it would prob
ably be due to the differences of opinion
existing between Lord Milner of Cape
town and Lord Kitchener, and it would
be announced In the form of promotion,
accompanied by the statement' that the
operations in South Africa no longer jus
tified the presence of an officer of the
seniority of Lord Kitchener.

This movement, he believes, will com
mence In America, where he believes the
economic conditions are Inferior to those
of Germany and France, especially the
latter, which, he maintains, is the sound

distribution of wealth between the agra
rian and metropolitan classes. -
Bookwalter spent the greater part of his
time living among: and closely studying
peasantry, and he Is thoroughly convinced
that a crisis is imminent between the
urban and rural populations of the world.
In the rise in the price of grain he sees
the beginning of a struggle of the agri
cultural element against the concentra
tion of capital in cities.
Italy almost from end to end, crossed the
Apennines, went over the Saint Gothard
Range and wheeled over the mountainous

Taylor has a long record of crime and
was in Jail awaiting trial for holding up
and robbing a passenger train on'the Gulf
Colorado and Banta Fe Railway near
Coleman, Tex., two years ago. Taylor
and other members of his band were cap
tured by State Rangers after a desperate
chase of several hundred miles, but short
ly after arrest he broke Jail and was nt
liberty for several months. He was" cap
tured a second time and on the trial of
one of his accomplices the latter turned
State s evidence and placed the blame for
the robbery on Taylor. The accomplice
was given his liberty in return for his
testimony.
Â¦ Taylor vowed vengeance, and a short
me thereafter he again escaped from
Jail. He got on the trail of the accom
plice who turned State's evidence and aft
er a chase of 300 miles he came upon the
man in a cow camp near the Rio Grande
The two men had a desperate duel wl 4
pistols at short range and . Taylor kiliea
his former companion. Shortly after this
Taylor was recaptured. He said that he
left Jail for the purpose of killing the
man who had turned State's evidence and
that he had another old score with a cer
tain man before he would be satisfied. It
is thought that he has gone in search of
this man, whom he has vowed to kill.

OFFICERS HAVE SOTJGHT
A PASSEN'GEH'S SLATTER
For the -benefit of those of my friends who
don't know the situation. I want to Bay that
there Is a grreat deal of animus on the part of
Fethers and his followers back of this proceed
ing The cause for this bitter feeling on his
part consists of my refusal to support him in
1896 and again In 1898. for supreme vice chan
cellor. He succeeded In being elected In 1898
at the convention held at Indianapolis and after
the contest was over threatened to drive me
out of the order.
I again refused to support him 1 for supreme
chancellor at the Supreme Lodge session held
at IJetrolt tn 1900. This action of mine seem
ingly-added to his enmity to me. Being su
preme chancellor he was ex-offlcio a member
of the board of controf and I was president of
the board, re-elected at the Detroit convention.
They claim that I voluntarily resigned. That
is not true; they made It Impossible for me to
continue as president, having long previously
contended that the president of the board ought
to devote his entire time to the business of the
rank and be paid a salary commensurate 'with
the service. Taking- advantage of this expres
sion of mine, a resolution was offered to that
effect and to be consistent I had to vote for it.
The resolution passed and, of course, I re
signed, because the endowment rank could not
pay the salary 'which I could afford to accept.
These are the exact circumstances under
which I resigned and no other. "When I re
signed as president I also desired to resign aa a
member of the board, but my request was vig
orously opposed by the whole board, and I con
cluded to continue as a member of the board.
Taking up the charges made in the re
nort of the Supreme Lodge, Hlnsey justi
fies his course in financial matters, and
his Btatement closes by saying:
"I am not ! Indebted to the endowment
rank to the extent of one cent, and have
not used any of its funds for my per
sonal benefit, neither directly or Indi
rectly." Â¦Â¦ ' ' " '- Â¦ ' Â¦
CHICAGO, July ll-John 'JL Hlnsey,
former president of tho board of control
of the endowment ranV of the Knights of

ing the report of Supreme Chancellor Og
den H. Elthers and the board of control

Lodge Just held in this city. Hlnsey says:

KJ33 MARKET STC.&E-/MIMis3 Hill resides in Alameda, and Is ons
of the most popular of the pretty girls of
the Tivoli chorus.
Colverd was just starting- for the thea
ter whan he heard Miss Hill scream, for
assistance. It was only a matter of a
minute for him to pull off his coat and
plunge into the water and* swim for the.
girl, who was sinking for the second time.
Colverd can swim as well as he can
play tho trombone, and he soon reached
the drowning pirl and bore her In safety
to the shore." It was a forty-yard swim,
and -when the gallant musician placed bis
dripping burden on terra firma he was
completely exhausted. A change of
clothes and several warm drinks quickly
restored the rescued and rescuer.
Mr. and Mrs. Colverd live In a trim lit
tle houseboat at Pleasant Cove, at thÂ»
foot of Powell street, and Miss Hill was
their guest. Yesterday the girl went for
a swim. She was not many minutes In the
water before she got tangled In the ropes
attached to the boats, and her cries for
help came shrilly over the water.
Jack Colverd, the trombone player of
the Tlvoli orchestra, is a hero. Colverd
distinguished himself yesterday by sav
ing Mae Hill, a pretty little chorus girl,
from a watery grave.

is so much smoke there must be some fire.
I am convinced your interest in these
women is not from a motive of friend
liness. You are always hanging around
the courts and I .want you from this time
to keep away from my court, and I will
advise the other Judges to make a similar
order."
The Judge said he. believed the woman
and adjudged Potter guilty of contempt
of court. He sentenced him to twenty
four hours in jail. Potter protested that
he was innocent, but the Judge promptly
silenced him.
The woman declared positively that
Potter was the man who made the propo
sition to her. He at first asked $20 and
finally reduced the amount to $10.
Detective T. B. Gibson found Bert Pot
ter, a teamster, at his home, 348 Clemen
tina . street, yesterday morning and
brought him into court. He was sworn
and denied that he had made the proposi
tion to the woman to "fix" the case for
$29. He said he had never spoken to her
on the subject and only saw her once
Â¦when she was in the company of Abe
Becker, the saloon-keeper, and "Pinkey."
Judge Fritz continued his Investigation
yesterday of the alleged charge that some
one had offered to "fix" the case of Stella
Bolman, charged with grand larceny, for

Captain Putnam Bradlee Strong, who is
sojourning in this city with Lady Francis
Hope, wife of the heir to the Duchy of
Newcastle, is likely to be court-martialed
and dismissed in disgrace from the United
States armv.
When the liaison of Captain Strong and
Lady Hope was exposed the military; man
at once sent his resignation by telegraph
to the. Secretary of War, fearing expul
sion from the army at the hands of the
authorities. Secretary Root accepted
Captain Strong's resignation immediately,
but on learning yesterday that' the gay
soldier was guilty T>f conduct unbecoming
an officer and a gentleman the War Sec
retary . at once withdrew his acceptance
of Captain Strong's resignation.
The "protector" of the ex-burlesque
singer and dancer, May Yohe, whose mar
riage to Lord Francis Hope placed her in
line of succession . to the coronet of a
Duchess of England, will be called upon
by the Secretary of War to forward by
letter the reasons for wishing to discard
the shoulder straps of an officer of ancle
Sam's army.
At the French restaurant on Geary and
Stockton streets the couple have-, given
strict orders that no one is to be allowed
to even approach their rooms.- The host
and the well 'trained garcons shrug their
shoulders when any inquiry is made for
Captain Strong or Lady Francis Hope.
Captain Strong sent his valet to the
Palace Hotel yesterday for his-mailand
telegrams. It is understood that one of
the telegrams was -from the Secretary of
War, who, in addition to notifying Cap
tain Strong that his resignation had not
been accepted, also ..ordered him to re
main in San Francisco on waiting orders.
Trouble Looms Ahead.
Lady Francis Hope is booked to sail for
the Orient next Wednesday on the Nippon
Maru. If Captain Strong attempts to de
part on the. same vessel he will be guilty
of -desertion from the army in the event
that the orders to remain in this city are
not countermanded by Secretary Root.
The flagrant violation of social ethics
by Captain Strong and Lady Francis Hope
is attracting the attention of the Pacific
Society for the Suppression of Vice. The
friends bf the couple informed them yes
terday of the arrest. in this city some
years, ago of the wife of a .well known
millionaire of Southern California and thÂ«
man ! who accompanied her \ to this city.
The possibility of being taken in a patrol
wagon to the City Prison and charged
with adultery has made no change in the
menage maintained by Lady Francis Hope
and Captain Strong.' They are known as
husband Â¦ and wife at "the restaurant to
which they fled after being ejected from
the California Hotel.!
Lady Francis Hope did not leave her
.apartments yesterday until the afternoon,
when, she accompanied Captain Strong
for a drive to the park in a closed car
riage.
:.The friends of Captain Strong are i say
ing. that he was very -much amused when
he read an account In a morning paper as
to Lady Francis Hope being identified by
her displaying the famous . diamonds of
the Hope family. May Yohe .when she
married- Lord Francis Hope was not pre
sented Â¦with any of the famous Hope jew
els. They are . heirlooms and are in the
custody of the Duke of- Newcastle, the
elder. brother of May.Yohe's husband. The
glittering gems- worn -Â¦ by Lady Francis
Hope in this city may possibly be replicas
of the famous* Hope jewels. . Lord Hope .

posed his marriage to May Yohe, but
there was a reconciliation after a time.
There is no possible doubt now that
Lord Hope will soon divorce his actress
wife.
When Mayor Strong of New York died
he was rated as a millionaire. His estate
Â¦was appraised, however, at $125,000, of
which amount Captain Strong, his son, re
ceived about $30,000. In the few months
that have elapsed since Captain Strong
secured his inheritance he has lived at a
rapid gait, and It is generally stated that
his means are almost exhausted.
Whether May Yohe will dispose of her
jewels in order to maintain her relations
with Captain Strong Is a doubtful ques
tion. She has always been fond of the
pleasures of Hie; and many men have lav
ished fortunes Jn entertaining her. She is
known to have objected seriously when
she married Lord Hope to using his fam
ily motto on her stationery. The motto
of the Hope family is "Loyalty knows not
shame."
A Washington dispatch says:
The War DeDartment does not desire . that
Stro'ng should complicate his case by any Ill
advised action. He may be able to make an
explanation, the officials nay, which will b?
entirely satisfactory and which will admit of
his retention in the service. The department
does not, of course, desire the retentiort of any
officer gruilty of scandalous conduct, but there
is certainly a disposition to be lenjent to
ward Caytaln Strong. There Is no intention
to appoint a court of inquiry to make an In
vestigation, nor Is it proposed to hold a court
martial. The uselessness of a. court is appar
ent when CaDtain Strong stands ready to
Bever his connection with the army.
It was. the understanding of the department
that financial matters connected with his
father's . estate were the cause of Captain
Strong's action. His explanation, called for
By/;, Secretary Root, will now be officially filed
with other papers regarding hia military
career. â¢

Lady Francis Can Hardly Hope for
' ' ' ' Eeconciliation.
NEW YORK, July 13.â There is no
doubt In* the minds of the friends of Lady
Francis Hope in this , city that she went
to San Francisco with Captain Strong
two weeks ago.' She had previously made
up her mind to sail for England to accept
overtures ; for reconciliation which had
been made by her husband.
All who. knew her. were aware of the
fact that she and Captain Strong had
been Infatuated with each other ever
since they met in Paris several years ago.
Captain Strong continued his attentions
after she returned to this country last
November, and Lord Francis finally *went'
to England, leaving his wife here. The
Duke. of Newcastle, Lord Francis" elder
brother, came to this country and tried
to patch up the differences.. Lord Francis
returned soon afterward, having â¢ sold
Deepdeem â¢ in Surrey, an estate which he
had inherited from his mother. His wife
did not meet him, though he had asked
her. to do so, and he joined his brother at
the Savoy Hotel. . '.
After a trip through the South with the
Duke of Newcastle Lord Francis returned
to England. Recently it was '; announced '
that he had written to his wife, offering
her a final chance to return to him. She
was strongly, advised to accept the offer.
Captain - Strong himself agreeing that: it
would be the wisest thing she could do.
; Lady Francis gave up her apartment on
July 1, and told all her friends that she
was going to England. She .was to have
saiied two weeks ago. ; Her friends Â¦ fear
that their presence In San I Francisco to-'
gether -has. not only seriously affected
Captain Strong's career but has also pre
vented any possibility that the^Hopes will
makeup their differences. ' Â¦ . .

Chinese Question to Be Presented to
- Epworth League Delegates.
In making: these requests we are actuated
only by a desire to protect our membership and
families. The hours now- worked and the
wages' Daid do not in any wise conmare with
those, in other sections of the country for sim
ilar work. We are under heavier living ex
penses than those employed as dock and ware
house men in San Francisco, where the wages
are far in excess of what we ask. â¢ Again, the
work along 1 the bay shores of this county Is
never as steady as that In San Francisco,
which diminishes the chances of providing
proper support for our families and to educate
our children to properly enter the field of hu
man endeavor.
We trust, therefore, you will see that we are
enduring wrongs that must be righted, and
the committee would be glad to have you or.
your authorized representative advise them of

and enterprise of the visitors. The claims

have taken tbe utmost pains to make' our stay
pleasant and to give. us opportunities for thor

It has been particularly noticeable that San

other places would . seem to be a detriment to
Its own - trade. ? I am sure that j I voleÂ© the

DOVER * Del., July 1 13.â The Delaware
witnesses in the celebrated Botkin murder
case will ettend the new trial and testify
for the people of Calif ornia. . and have so
communicated to the Attorney General of
California. The last witness was heard
from to-day. '-- It Is John P. Dunning, hus
band of the Dover woman, who -with her
sister, Mrs. Ida D. Deane. was killed- by
poisoned candv sent by Mrs. Botkin in
August, i 1898. ; â¢ Dunning in a letter, which
he voluntarily, wrote to-day to Mr. Deane
- "You can, Inform the California author
ities that I will be there at the trial and
will be ready to 4 go, whenever they call
upon, me,: at any .' hour, and ': will, submit
again* to- all; the criticism and roasting
of the former trial." ~ A; r . Â¦
The ordeal of the former trial, say. the
Delaware witnesses, was the most' severe
on Mr.: Dunning that they have ever seen
Inflicted Â¦Â¦ upon a witness. The whole list
of .witnesses from I this. State who will
make the : transcontinental Â¦ trip is now
complete, and all will positively go except
Dr: Li'.-A. Bishop, the first. physician called
tn for. Mrs.' Dunning," and Professor T. j R.
Wolfe, acting, president of Delaware Col
lege, each : of whom has asked -an extra
allowance of " $1000. <Dr. , Bishop Â¦ will, of
course," have to I be : paid, but it i ia â¢ under

points can be had before the court of last

Second Point Raised. '^
" The second point raised in support of
the petition for a writ of habeas corpus

reads: . : Â¦ â¢ Â¦ Â¦ -

In the petition for the writ- of habeas

conviction having been secured under that
section of the Penal Code which reads:, ';Â¦â¢

judgment, in the hope that a favorable
decision may save her the ordeal of a sec

FOR MRS. BOTKIN
ONE of the rHbst tragic suicides
reported to tliS Morgue in a long
time was that of a stranger who
deliberately knelt in front . of an
approachln- passenger train *at
Eighteenth and Harrison streets last
night and calmly welcomed Inevitable
death. A head completely severed from
the body as . if by a knife and the sev
ered f ragments of the body gathered up
along the stretch of railroad track for
100 feet now occupy a slab at the Morgue,
mute evidence of the accomplishment of
the strange being's desire to leave this
vale of tears.
The suicide's horrible act was not com
mitted on the impulse of a moment. He
had evidently contemplated the deed for
somo tlme.for he was v seen loitering
about In the vicinity, apparently awaiting
hij opportunity . since * morning.' â¢ He was
poorly . dressed and his .actions created
Shortly after 5 o'clock the whistle of
the south-b^und San Jose express sound
ed -the crossing signal and the stranger
was seen to approach the track. : He
stood for a time as if waiting for the
train to pass and then suddenly sprang
forward \ and . stopped between the rails
when the pilot of the engine, driving
along at a high rate of speed, was but
fifty feet away. . Â¦;-Â¦Â¦.
.The' horrified spectators Â¦ turned their
heads as the man deliberately dropped to
his knees and laid his neck over one of
the rails. In an Instant the heavy loco
motive had done its bloody work. A
human head rolled in the dust alongside
of the track, and the body, ground to
fragments beneath the wheels of the
cars, was scattered In many directions.
The engineer of the train was powerless
to avert the tragedssf ' He was taken by
surprise and did not realize what was
some comment, but no one questioned
him and he remained throughout the day,
pacing up and down and paying little
heed to any one.
Th* chairman of the committee. Colonel
George Stone, has frequently declared that
he was opposed to the scheme of calling a
meeting of the State body. He did not
Issue the call for a meeting until the
pressure came with great force from the
source that issues orders. HI* own Judg
ment was against the proceeding, but he
was not able to stand up.
Republican- merchants, business men
Stone Changes His Mind.
The bosses of both political parties are
pulling together to bring the Republican
Etate Central Committee into the San
Francisco municipal contest. The argu
ment is put forward by the Republican
bosses that Mayor Phelan controls the
Board of Election Commissioners and
that the Republican members of the board
take orders from the Mayor. The people
, of San Francisco have greater respect for
the Election Commissioners than they
have for W. F. Herrin. Jere Burke, John
C. Lynch and the other bosses in the
camp of Crimmlns and Kelly. The inter
ference of the Republican State Commit
tee is not sought by the voters belonging
to the party.

about to happen until he saw the cronch
inj? figure directly ahead of him. He In
stantly applied the air and reversed his
lever, but It was -too late and. the train
ran a hundred feet before It was brought
to a standstill. â¢.- â¢ '
Four people in the vicinity witnessed
th> tragic act. William Connolly, Alex
Hogue, John Spangler and Sam. Harring
ton were standing on an opposite corner,
but, like the engineer, could do nothing.
'Deputy Coroners Brown and Smith ar
rived on the scene a short time afterward
and took charge of the dismembered re
mains. They spent most of the evening
In. an effort to discover the man's Iden
tity, but without success. Nothing in the
torn and bloody clothing could assist
them. A pocket comb alone remained In
ono of the vest pockets.
The suicide was apparently 35 years of
age. He had light hair and a light mus
tache. He was attired in a black coat
and vest, gray trousers and wore no
socks. Hla shoes were dusty and had
been used for some time.
and workingmen will take note of the sig
nificant fact that the Republican State
Committee is being- used at the instance
of W. F. Herrin and Jere Burke, who are
on the railroad pay roll and using South
ern Pacific prestige to do politics. John
C. Lynch of the Federal brigade is also in
the scheme to deprive- the Republican
voters of San Francisco of the right to
regulate their own affairs.
The Election Commissioners will meet
to-morrow to determine the questions in
volved, and it is to be hoped that they
will do their duty as the law directs. They
are assured that the citizens of San Fran
clsco will honor their courage and intelli
gence if they refuse to obey the orders of
political rounders, and railroad lawyers
and lobbyists. .. ' . Â»

Conger is favorably inclined toward the

opinion that the latter la becoming more

leave of absence and says that ( he never

does now. When he reathes Peking he

In reference to the Chinese indemnity
Mr. Conger says that he is fully satisfied

slowly this work has to be done and what
difficulties have â¢ to be contended with.
Mr. Conger is satisfied that there will

no more organized rebellions.- He says
the Boxer movement is thoroughly
crushed out and that the Chinese have
been severely punished and. will not dare
to start "such another movement.

TRATION BY PROPER USE
OF FOOD.
TO KEEP OUT OF NERVOUS PROS-
It is a lamentable fact that American
brain workers do not. as a. rule, know
how to feed themselves to rebuild the
daily loss occasioned by active mental
effort This fact, coupled with the dis-
astrous effects of the alkaloids contained
In tobacco, coffee and Â¦whisky, makes a
sure pathway toward nervous prostra-
tion.
Ths remedy is simple enough. Em-
ploy the services of a food expert, who
knows the kind of fopd required to re-
build the daily, losses in the human body.
This can be done by making free use of
Grape-Nuts, the famous breakfast food,
which contains exactly the elemental
principles which have an affinity for
albumen and gro directly to rebuild the
pray matter in the brain, solar plexus
and nerve centers throughout the body.
Follow your selection of food up with
a dismissal of coffee, tobacco and whisky
" for nfteen days and .mark the difference
in your mental ability, which means
everything to the average hustling
American, who must nave physical- and
mental strength or he falls out in the
nice for dollars.

Without dandruff, hair must-
grow luxuriantly; and it will be
soft and silky. Herpicide is a de-
lightful hair dressing, being: en-
tirely free from preasiness. It
makes the scalp clean and feel
fresh. One" bottle will convince
an\' one of Â¦ Herpicide's merits
over all other hair dressings. i
Xewbro's Herpicide is the only
hair preparation in the world made
to kill the dandruff cerra that
claims to kill the dandruff perm
and that actually does kill the
dandruff germ.
NEWBRO'S
HERPICIDE
(s the On'y Known Remedy
That Kii.'s the Dandruff Germ.
"He took a rabbit and inoculated
it deeply under the skin with the
fluid. As he hoped and anticipated,
the rabbit speedily began- to lose Its
fur. and In between five and six
weeks it was completely denuded â
Jn fa<-t. it had become entirely
bald."â From Pasteur Institute,
Paris, France. Official Report.
M. Sehouraud found that this mi-
crobe which makes men ba'd is so
deadly to hair that it is possible
that animals inoculated with it lose
all their fur.
"The development and growth oÂ£
the microbe causes certain changes
in its environmentsâ the breaking
up. for Instance, of substances
around from which It obtains nec-
essary food and ener?ryâ and the
cycle of results thus brought about
pives the production of a substance
poisonous to the root of a hair.
This tcxln passes down to the root
and acts as a Flow poison, not kill-
ing all at once, but inducing cer-
tain characteristic symptoms: the
hair becomes liehter in color until
its pigment has practically disap-
peared; its diameter gradually les-
sens, it becomes brittle and dried up
and eventually dies and falls out.
The root, though weakened by the
poison, sends up another hair to re-
place the fallen one. but the new
outgrowth begins life feebler and
poorer than Its predecessors, so It,
too, only -with greater speed, be-
comes a victim. So It goes on; each
successive outgrowth starts more
weakly its fight against the in-
sinuating poison until a point is
reached when the root can no
longer make a fresh effort, for it
has also fallen completely under the
noxious influence as it does simul-
taneously in hundreds of adjacent
hair-follicles, naturally resulting in
complete baldness."
M. Sebouraud. a former pupil of
the great Pasteur, has discovered
the microbe of baldness, says a
v.riter in the London Contemporary
Review.

"^^ league colors so constantly In
evidence amply prove. Every
Incoming overland train furnishes its
quota of Leaguers to swell the number
now in the city, so that their presence in
our midst is becoming more and more
conspicuously apparent.
!Co less than 600 leaguers arrived In the
city yesterday, making the total now here
nearly 3000. Yesterday's arrivals belonged
to no special party, but they came as
ordinary passengers on toe regular trains,
of which four arrived. AH trains were
from one to three hours late, but this did
not disconcert the members of the recep
tion committee, who extended ' the hand
of welcome to every traveler . who wore
the Epworth cap or league badee. One
party of twenty-five arrived at the foot
of Market street at 5:30 a. m., where they
were met by the committee and escorted
to the. Pavilion. The members of the
party were registered and after breakfast
had been provided all were furnished
quarters by the entertainment committee.
This prompt discharge of duty, even at
the expense of personal comfort, is dis
played among the membership of all the
committees without exception. It is to
this enthusiasm manifested by the active
workers that the success of the Epworth
convention Â¦ wiU be principally due.
Through the painstaking efforts of these
indefatigable workers on the committees
the reputation of California for warm
hearted hospitality will be added to.
All Incoming trains were met by the
Berkeley and Oakland 'sections of the re
ception committee. * The- sectipn- at the
ferry was managed by-J.-C Smith. The
Oakland section was. under the guidance
of A. H. Trathen.
The treatment accorded the members of
the committee and the aids by the public
officials and the transportation people has
been most courteous. Every effort is be
ing made to assist those . in charge of
terminal points in the most practical
manner. The Harbor Commissioners have
even gone to the Inconvenience of vacat
ing their offices in the grand nave of the
ferry building, and have installed the fer
ry section of the reception' committee
therein. The Commissioners.. ha,ve- also
agreed to light up the building whenever
the reception committee may desire It for

service. Its particular -province is' to: as

supplement the work of the other com

has also installed in the. Pavilion a com

morning Lennon made a motion for a new
trial, chiefly on the ground that the Judge
had erred In his instructions to the jury.
He quoted numerous authorities in .sup
port of the motion. Assistant District At
torney Deuprey briefly replied, and the
Judge denied the motion. Â¦
â¢ The Judge said it was not a pleasant
duty to pass Judgment upon the defend
ant, but the lav/ must be upheld. One of
the most grievous points , that>he had
noted during the trial was the defendant's
insensibility to the fact that he had com
mitted a crime against honorable men.' He
regretted that the custom was too preva
lent for young men. to condone offenses
of the kind. They seemed to glorify men
who committed these crimes, and in that
regard they fell far short of the customs
of their fathers. He failed to understand
why the defendant had committed the
crime. Ho seemed a young man of ability
and intelligence, and was apparently fit tb
fill any position in the gift cf the com
monwealth. He could not comprehend it.
As the court was about to pronounce
judgment Attorney Lennon interrupted
him and 'made an earnest and impassioned
plea for the mercy of the court, not alone
for the defendant, but for his wife and lit
tle son. 1 He pointed out that the defend
ant had. been nearly three years in jail,
and for the short time he had been at lib
erty he. had worked to support his family,
showing a desire for reformation.
- "I have no assurance of that," replied
the Judge. â¢= "If I thought the - defendant
was sincere In; his reformation I would
not sentence him to a single day."
Lennon continued his plea, and stiid that
although the defendant might seem cold
and phlegmatic he keenly felt the position
in which he had placed himself. There
was already a conviction against him and
the case was in the Supreme Court on ap
peal,'and there was still another case on
the court's calendar. The day would come
when the defendant would walk from the
prison walls to take up again the battle
of life -with a renewed and good purpose.
< Deuprey said there was no desire on the
part of the prosecution to be merciless,
but if seemed to him that the defendant
had forgotten his wife and child when
committing the crime. It was not done
in a moment of passion, but was premedi
tated. - . . â¢ -
The Judge said he would give Judgment
at 1:30 o'clock, and at that time when
court reconvened. he said'.that the defend
ant was yet young . and there- was a
chance of his reformation. "â¢ Punishment
was not so much, to punish, -but to re
strain others from crime. If the defend
ant- had a ,. proper idea of citi
zenship and became a good citizen he
might do v well, as he had a splendid per
sonality and intelligence. His first impres
sion Lwas to give him the limit, fourteen
years, but under, all. the circumstances he
thought ; the ends of justice would be
served by a sentence of eight? years in San
Quentin.- : ,--.. Â¦..'-.. }' >
McGlade .retained % his composure
throughout, and did not seem in. the least
perturbed when sentence was passed upon
him. The trial of the/other, case against
him was continued for three weeks. : â¢ .

here that an English explorer, Jackson,
was staying when Nansen and, his com
panion came back from their historic
journey. And hither came Wellman. an
American, several years ago when he
meditated an attack on the pole. Baldwin
was with him at the time.
Baldwin has etudied the procedure and
equipments of his predecessors carefully,
and has sought ' to discover the reasons
why they did not achieve greater tri
umphs. He has sought to improve on their
methods. He carries an unusual lot of
food in condensed form and more dogs to
haul his sledges than any other Arctic ex
plorer ever had. In other particulars also
it is probable he is better provided for his
undertaking. Moreover, he takes the Stars

of a host of friends.

LOS ANGELES.
Mosklman, who was on the slab for the
Oaklands, although weak from recent ill
ness, pitched excellent ball and kept the
six hits which were made off his delivery
well scattered. The score:
C. Reilly. at third, Reitz at second and
Bowman in left field all participated in
brilliant plays. C. Reilly, in the early
part of the game so greatly distingnished
himself that he almost succeeded in win
ning his way into the hearts of the fans.
Hale, who pitched for the losers, besides
restricting his opponents to but three hits
secured two hits himself, the first he has
made during the season.
Despite the sweltering heat, the game
of baseball which was -played yesterday
at the Eighth and Harrison streets
grounds' between the Oakland and Los
Angeles teams glistened with innumer
able snappy plays. The talent from across
the boy took sweet revenge for the de
ieat which was administered to them on
the previous* day. With the score tied at
1 to 1 in the eighth inning and with
: Francks on the third station Lohman
drove a beautiful hit to the left garden
which won the game for the Oakland
team. â¢
To the hardest of hard luck more than
to poor playing may be attributed Los
Angeles' defeat. With Bowman on third
base in one Inning C. Reilly launched a
long, high fly out Into center field. It
was taken into- custody by j Drennan. On j
the play Bownjan attempted to reach the
home station, but was called out by Um
pire Levy on the ground that he failed to
hold his base until after the ball i had
landed in the ' fielder's hands. The decis
ion of the umpire, although considered
just by a major part of the fans, was se
verely criticized by Manager Morley. The
Southern baseball magnate threatened all
kinds of dreadful things, even to with
drawing his team from, the league.

Feeling so why should I live to be as enor-Â»

I have chosen, the morphine route as tha

Let no one try to pay my debts. They are
paid by this act of mine. If I could I 'would
suggest a few I would rather see paid than
others. I freely -torglve those who have
wronged me. : Hoping this explanation ex

VANCOUVER, B. C, July 13.â Police
Judge j Joseph Russell narrowly escaped
death just after, a session of the Police
Court at noon to-day. He was assailed
by Michael Sullivan, a member of the
strikers' committee of the fishermen.
Sullivan made his escape after the attack.
Judge Russell was standing on Powell
street, in front of the police station, talk-
ing with a friend, when suddenly' a man
rushed up and demanded why the Magis
trate had been out last night in. one of
the police patrol boats. The Judge Is a
cannery manager and the feeling against
him and other members -of the Canners'
Association has mounted to a high pitch.
The Magistrate replied that it was no
b'usiness of any one but himself.
"Wejl, 1 had the drop on you last night
and I am sorry I did not fill you full of
lead," said Sullivan.
"Tou ought to be under lock and key,"
replied the , Magistrate.
With an oath the man drew a revolver
from his hip pocket. Judge Russell, who
is an athlete, sprang at him before he
could pull the trisrger. Sullivan got away
and fled down the street, with the Justice
at his heels. All of the policemen who
happened to be around the station Joined
in the chase. Sullivan led them up Water
street,, ran through the lengtn of two ho
tels, down an alley and into two business
streets. Then he dashed Into the side
entrance of a saloon and was lost to
view. A patrol of police surrounded the
block, but although the search was kept
up for two hours the man got away. It
was learned afterward that he stood in
a closet while his pursuers passed four
feet away, and then quietly walked back
Into the street.

While It appears by the terms of the

reason of the value of the property which
was deeded to Mrs. Tevis Bhortly after

A telegram was read from the executive
officers in the East stating that the local
unions would have the moral and financial
support of their brethren throughout the
East. This was offset in a measure by
the fact that the Brewers' Protective As
sociation had invited the general secreta
ries of the National Union of Brewery
Workmen to come to this coast and en
deavor to settle matters.- It was decided
to refer the whole question to the various
unions throughout the State, with a view
of taking a referendum vote. It will take
under the circumstances nearly two
weeks to reach a result. Secretary Berg
says that all the men will continue at
work until the matter Is thus settled.

at the United States Marine Hospital for
H. Johnson, whom Nielsen represented to
be a sailor, whereas Johnson was only a

Last night, while "Bugs""was sleeping, a half

afternoon, while "Bugs" was visiting friendÂ»,
tha advance guard held a mock funeral, using
the mustache for corpse. As none of \ the
hair was saved a piece of Jack Hennos' dog's
tail was used. This' was placed In a small
fruit box. A cross wan prepared to mark the
Bpot where the mustache was interred and
the boys formed for the solemn ceremonies.
Three drummers led the way, followed by two
buglers. Then came the' honorary pall-bearers,
carrying a cross on which was printed in green
letters, "Sacred to the Memory of Bugs'
Mustache."- Following in their wake were
the bearers' of the priceless bunch of hair
neatly tied with a piece of hay-rope. The fun

then out to the parade ground, where the burial
services wercheld. Bugler Cresalla, who Is a

The "corpse" was lowered Into, its abiding
place, tap3 was blown, drums were muffled,

DEPARTURE OF THE CADETS.
Market-Street Crowds Review .. the
Passing 1 Companies.
Led by Lieutenant Colonel McGloln. the-
League of the Cross Cadets marched
down Market street yesterday afternoon
with drums beating and banners floating
gayly in the west â¢wind. The boys were
off to the summer camp in the Napa Val
ley, and each felt himself every Inch a
soldier as the martial music made . his
blood go bounding to his head. . He looked
every Inch a soldier, too. The boys of the
several companies made, in fact, a most
martial appearance in their dark blue uni
forms with '.red trimmings, . their cam
paign hats and leggings, and with their
rolls of blanketa about their shoulders.
The companies began assembling at the
Market-street armory early in the after
noon, and for an hour or two the place
was full of : the bustle of preparation 'for
the march. - . At 2 :30 tho , order was given
to fall In, ) and the companies I began to
find their places. In ten- minutes more,
headed by the League of the Cross band,
the ferry to see the last of the young
toldJers, and many of these crossed with
them on the boat.
SCENES ATTENDING THE DEPARTURE OF THE LEAGUE OF THE
CROSS CADETS FOR CAMP POWER AT NAPA, WHERE FOR A
TIME THEY WILL DO MILITARY DUTY.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, CAMP
POWER, NAPA; July 13.â The
First Regiment, League of the
Cross Cadets, arrived in this city
shortly after 6:30 o'clock this
evening. The train drew up at the First
street crossing and the cadets poured out
of the cars like so many bees. Cheers
greeted them and the young soldiers re
sponded with happy shouts of recognition.
There was an immense crowd at the train.
Pretty girls predominated and the cadets
proceeded to break hearts like so many
gallants. The advance guard, which has
been here for the last three days, setting
up tents and making itself popular as well
as useful, was drawn up in line at the
station and presented sabers to its fellow
cadets. . Â¦/ .
As soon as the cars drew'away the regi
ment formed in line and, precedtTd by its
brass band, marched through the main
thoroughfares. Crowds lined the streets
and welcomed the boys. The cadets made
a martial showing and their appearance
and soldierly marching aroused favorable
criticism."
When the command reached Camp Pow
er It was drawn up in battalion formation.
Orders for the night and the morrow were
read by the adjutant. The detail for
guard duty numbered forty men. Captain
Philip Bannln of Company C is officer of
the day and Captain J. McCormick of
Company D officer of the guard. â¢
The cadets were then marched to their
company streets and took formal posses
sion of their tented homes. Five minutes
were given to the.command to prepare to
attack rations. Mess call sounded loud
and clear and the bugler wa3 blessed for
the timely warning, as the cadets were
hungry. Company by company marched
to the open-air dining place. "When all
were at their proper nlaces Rev. Philip
OÂ£Ryan, chaplain of the regiment, said
grace. The boys listened with bowed
heads and hats over their hearts. When
this little ceremony was concluded they
sat down- and fell to Â¦with vigor. The first
meal of the regiment in camp was hugely
enjoyed. ,
After supper the cadets removed the
stains of travel and dust from their
clothes and then went uptown on an all
conquering expedition. As usual brass
buttons and glittering cros3 cannons cap
tured the fair ones. Some of the boys
forgot to return to camp before taps,
and when they did come in it was on the
run, with the guard hot on their heels.
Before midnight the guardhouse was filled
to overflowing. These culprits will be
compelled to tidy up camp to-morrow
morning. Those who escaped the guard
after taps are proudly boasting of their
cleverness.
The following * routine will govern the
encampment: First call for reveille, 5:20;

many Interesting 1 Â¦ stories to tell their friends.
During their short stay in Napa they have
made Innumerable friends and have been ac
corded the best treatment by the residents.
Last night the Native Daughters of Napa In
vited a number of cadets to be their guests
at an Informal social held In their lodgeroom.

Stewards O'Dea and Drossel of the Hospital
Corps were awakened - from sound slumber by
a flock of ducks that marched in stately dig
nity Into their tent and quacked a reveille.
O'Dea shooed them, out and returned to sleep
the march was. begun along the crowded
street, which ceased Us crowding for a
moment to Â¦watch the boys go past. There
were fifteen companies in line, 350 boys all
told, and they reached the ferry, building
in ample time to take the 3 o'clock boat
for the Oakland mole, where they board
ed i a train for. Napaâ¢ At Oakland they
were joined by two more .companies, of
seventy-flve men, so thatÂ»tnere will be
more than 400 cadets in camp when they
reach their destination. There was. a
large crowd of. friends and relatives at
Ftrrtugs were evidently at work in this
city about midnight last night and they
Trertced rapidly, confining their efforts
wlthir. a. radius of several blocks ami
making stables the especial mark for tha
torch. Alarm after alarm ran* in. excit
ing citizens and keepiajr the Fire Depart
ment busy.
Shortly before midnight an alarm
called the Fire Department to Turk street
and Van Ness avenue. A blaze hid been
discovered !n the stables of the San Ma
tÂ»o r>tlry Company, situated In the rear
of 715 Turk street and facing on Elm ave
nue. When the engines arrived the sta
bles were a mass of flames and a second
alarm was sounded for more apparatus.
Derp'.te the efforts of Chief Sullivan and
his men. the fiery element completely de
stroyed the two-story frame building and
Its contents. Eipht valuable horses be
longing to the San Mateo Dairy Company
were fctirned to a crisp and a like fate was
met by four animals belonging to H.
Sturfiiv&nt. a coal man doing business on
Golden Gate avenue and Larkin street.
Four milk wagons and their contents and
two coal wagons were destroyed by the
flames.
A. Berg:, the owner of the dairy, who
resides at 717 Turk street, was burned
about the fsce and hand? In trying to
save some of his horses. He resides next
door to th* Ftable? and was awakened
by the screams of the animals. Berg
locked up the stables at 10 p. m. and is
positive that everything was safe when
he retired. The rear of 717 Turk street
and the porch of 236 Elm avenue were se
verely damaged. The stables were owned
by A. Levi and Trere fully insured. The
loss on the stables is estimated at $1003.
Berg estimated his loss In horses and
wagons at $3000, while Sturdivant's prop
erty -was estimated to be worth Â£2009. Berg
and SturdJvant were insured for half the
amount of their losses.
Another Stable on Fire.
"VTMIe the firemen were at work an
alarm was sent in for a burning stable in
the rear of 7Â» Ellis street, facing on Olive
avenue. The second fire was but three
Mocks from the first. Six horses belong
ing- to O'Meara & McCarthy, coal dealers,
were in the stable on Olive avenue and
wer? safely taken out of the burning
building by Special Officer Stevenson. The
rtab!e was completely destroyed, the
fenaf? being estimated at J1000.
At 1:20 o'clock this morning, as the fire
apparatus was on its way home, a fire
Â¦was discovered In the rear of a saloon
owned by D. B. Dunbar. on the northeast
comer cf Geary and Larkin streets, In the
locality of the other two. The prompt ar
rival of the firemen and engines prevented
any but nominal damage. ,
The third alarm from box 137. located
at Laxkin and Post streets, and the sixth
from that locality, was sounded at 2:10.
The stable of the Signal Transfer Com
pany on Larkin street, between Bush and
Gutter, was blazing fiercely, and the
flames were only subdued after a hard
struggle.
Fifty head of horses were in the stable
Â¦when the fire broke out and six perished.
The rescue of the animals was accom
plished with great difficulty, owing to the
Intensity of the heat and the fierce strug
gles of the horses.
The stable is in the rear of 1110 Larkin
ftreet and is owned by A- Boardman.
The property at 1110 and 1112 Larkln
etreet. â¢which is also owned by Board
inan, is considerably damaged.
Police Pour Into District.
As soon as It became evident that the
fires were ot Incendiary origin the police
poured into the locality from which the
Â¦lanne were sounding, in the hope of cap
turing the dastards who were applying
the torch, or at least of preventing more
destruction of property.
Owners of stables were aroused and told
to watch their buildings. So many peo
ple were running to the fires from va
rious directions that the police stood lit
tle chance of capturing the truilty ones.
All the available policemen were sent
Into the district with Instructions to con
tinue the patrol until daylight. Mem
bers of the detective force in citizens'
clothes also scoured the neighborhood.

American River's Gold.
Silas Peary writes to the Amador Dis
patch that there are millions of dollars
In gold at the very door of Sacramento in
the American River. Peary says:
j From a tew mites below Folsom down to
the raouth of the river 1 am told that the bed-
I rock on the bottom of the river has scarcely
j been touched by miners at any time, owing fo
j its drr>th nnd the dlfncultles attendant upon
i deep gravel or placer mining by the former
I system of oreraiion, thus leaving at the bot
tom of, this *reat natural tall race all the
' rich virgin gold that it originally contained.
besio.es the millions that have accumulated In
the sand and crave! since mining commenced
on the upper American River in 1849. TestB
nave been made of the late deposits of sand
and travel in the river channel and bars and
1 am informed that they show an average
prospect of not less than 30 cents per cubic
yard very near the ton. )
If these prospects are correctâ and I have no
doubt about them-the American River is in
deed one cf the Greatest gold bonanzas ever
known !n California, if not in the world.
There are millions upon millions of cubic
yards cf this sand and gravel in this
great irround alulce. in which the gold has
been concentrating ever since mining first
commenced fn the State, and it is but reason
able to presume that the gravel gradually be
comes richer and richer as the bottom is ap
proached, which point, as I before stated, will
be found In its virgin richness.
It would be folly to attempt to even approxl
rriately estimate the gold in this river, but
tliat it will reach many millions of dollars is
not the figures of wild fancy.
By tha up-to-date system of gold dredging it
is an established fact that gravel situated as
that In the American River can be worked at
a cost not exceeding 4 cents per cubic yard
leaving a marrln for possible accidents and
bad luck" which sometimes occur. Even if
it should cost es high as S cents to work the
dirt and brine down the contents as low as
, "HlS aer cubic yard, even then the profits
ft* â¢m.â¢ r Ch f n 5*, 1 , WOUM reach hl * h U P Into
J^rÂ»? u T of . do Â»ars for those who might
operate it. I have every reason to believe
?ZIJ C a Â£? IW , >leld of the wel Â«" the
"4Â£rIiiÂ£St JH2S Â£ r over twent y miles above
Sacramento will be very materially above the
figures I have suggested.
Hayward Gets Tories
The Plymouth Consolidated mines in
Amador County, which have been trans
ferred to Alvinza Hayward and the Ho
bart estate, were largely owned by Hav
ward and W. S. Hobart for many years
The transfer was brought about by the
failure of the company to meet its pay
ments. The mines produced an average
of $53,000 per month for five years. A fire
caused a shutdown after tha mines had
been worked to the depth of 1700 feet.
The Sonora Union-Democrat reports
that Prank Plummer and partner uncov
ered a $1000 gold pocket in the Telephone
mine recently located' by* them. The
strike was made near the surface. An
other rich strike has been made in the
Susarman pocket mine on - Bald Moun
tain. The extent of the strike is not
known, but it will go into the thousands.
The Tanzy pocket mine situated just
outside the northeasterly limits of So
nora, which yielded a $40,000 pocket about
five years ag-o, Is still being operated un
der lease by Birney, Munroe & Co. Since
the big strike the mine has produced onlv
55000.

BOARD OPPOSES
ALL TRANSFERS
?-
Will Adopt a Stringent
Rule for Teachers
Who Apply.
The Board of Education has dedded to
ba more particular in the future regard-
Ing, the granting- to teachers of transfers
from one school to , another. " Heretofore
it has been the practice of the board in
most cases to act favorably on the appli
cations, of teachers who desired to be as
signed to schools near, which they re
sided. . Mrs. Kincaid, president of the
board , said yesterday that in future the
convenience of teachers would not be con
sulted in the matter of transfers. If it Is
possible to grant the application the board
will do so, but no teacher will be trans
ferred simply because' she may ' happen to
reside ' a ; long- distance J away ' from I the
school in ' which she is teaching. | If there
are physical reasons for making:, the
change the transfer will be made. ; The
rules affecting transfers will be made
more stringent in the-future. '
The, board will meet on Wednesday to
inaugurate a new classification. So much
unfavorable ' criticism has been engen
dered over, the requirement of fifty-five
pupils in each class .that it is almost cer
tain that the rule wiiÂ» be abrogated. The
board has finally come to the conclusion
that fifty-five pupils are too many for one
teacher to do full Justice to. There will
be no particular limit set to the enroll
ment, but only the number of pupils that
a classroom can comfortably accommo
date will be admitted. This will do away
with Â¦ some pupils occupying the desks
while others are absent. Â¦ â¢ -'Â¦ . -V
P From 'all accounts Miss ' Margaret Â¦/ Mc-
Kenzie, ; principal of the Hancock Gram
mar School, whose trial on charges of in
competency. has just been , concluded, will
fare-badly at the hands * of ; the board.

"There are two happy old men in a cozy
little home out; on Howard street, and
their happiness is not due to thoughts "of
the leaguers that throng our streets nor
of the famous marksmen that are arriv
ing on every train./ They are happy : in
their thoughts of each other, for until last
Friday night they had not met for fifty
years. Â¦ â¢
They are Joseph and Charles Cooke,
and each has lived more than man's al
lotted three score and ten years. Both are
white-haired, wrinkled and 'bear other
marks of age, but from the eye of each
beams the light of a brotherly love, which
a half-century of separation has not
dimmed. They are both bright and chat
ty, and "Joe" laughs heartily as "Char
lie" tells him of some boyish prank in
which they participated more than fifty
years ago. They speak of these pranks
of the days of their youth as if they had
happened but yesterday, and enjoy the
telling.
Joseph Cooke, who is 76 years of age ana
resides at 1760 Howard street, left his
home in Ohio in 1851, leaving his brother
Charles, Ms junior by rive years, at home
to care for the farm. He traveled across
the plains with an ox team, settled in
Salem, Or., and embarked in business. He
remained there until five years ago, when
he came to this city with his family to
enjoy a much needed rest.
His brother Charles remained In North
Monroeville, Ohio, tilling the acres which
his brother had left in his charge.
The meeting was an affecting one and af
forded the two old gentlemen a great deal
of pleasure. The visiting brother will re
main here for, some time and then go to
Oregon, where he will spend a week or so
with another brother, whom he has not
seen for forty-eight years.

This grove will be. visited by the Past

ed a committee to arrange for an excur

cussed was the resolution of the" Grand
Grove that the association "and others of
the same character in different parts of
the jurisdiction v/ould be of great advan
tage to the order. It- was decided that

to the circles but to the groves to take
hints.
El Dorado Circle at its last held meet
ing initiated two candidates. The follow

Circle gave a pleasing entertainment on
the 5th inst., which was well attended.
Cypress Circle has ordered a new set of
regalia for officers and members.
Supreme Arch Beckman has written for
a copy of the constitution of California's
Grand Circle to be used in the organiza
tion of a grand circle in the State of Min
nesota. -
The noble grand arch of Ohio in his re
port to the Grand Grove of that State
recommends the organizing ' of a grand
circle in that State, expressing the opin
ion that it would be for the welfare of
the order. The Grand Grove acted upon
the recommendation and appointed a com
mittee to organize such a body. â¢
A new . Druidic circle was instituted at
Los Angeles by Mrs. A. Sorensen. G. A.
D., last week with a membership of flfty
two. The circle is called Golden West.

Drastic liquidation of speculative accounts
has swept the stock market this . week and
considerable long selling has been added under
the threat of damage to values of securities
by developments indicating future impairment
of earning power. The speculative buying,
which was conducted pretty eteadlly during
June, has been thoroughly shaken out and the
level of prices cairieci below where it started.
The process was begun last week and cut
â¢ihort by the aojournment of the Stock Ex
< hung from Wednesday until Monday of this
week. T'ie developments during the interfm
aggravated the : rtsture to tell this week. Â» A
eurvey of the motives of the June speculation
will help the understanding of the acuteness
0/ the depression this week. For one thing,
the stiffness of the money market waÂ» per-
Firtently Ignored during June on the supposi
tion that with the July requirements met and
the accumulations rediebursed there would be
sr t abundance of resources and easy credits.
On the contrary, bankers have shown a
markÂ«>d indisposition to extend credits for
*P*-oulatlvÂ« purposes. They have exercised
more stringent discrimination as to collateral
under the influence of the disclosures in con
nection with the Seventh National Bank fail
ure and they have called many loans to repair
Inroads made upon tbeir legal reserves. Fresh
exports of gold to Germany made additional
drains. The movements oT the Interior money
markets have indicated an unusually early de
mand upon New York for funds to move the
crops and bankers have felt impelled to pre
pare themselve* for this. The sums disbursed
for dividends and interest on July 1 made no
impression on the stock market In the way
of ceniand for reinvestment. Wall street is
inclined to recognize a division Into two groups
of the dominant financial power of the -country
â the distinction between which was empba
rtze<J by the struRKle for control ot Northern
Pacific. The operations of these two groups
are easily distinguished as independent, but as
a result of the promised settlemAat of the
Northern Paelnc contest they were Â¦ supposed
to be not antagonistic and to be u one to
support the stock market at the high range
of pricee. The fear got abroad -thla week that
the policy of the two groups In this respect

SEW YORK, July 13. â There was a feverish
and erratic market for 6tocks throughout the
day's chort eessicn due to hesitation engen
dered in the minds of the bears by the vio
lent break in the corn market and by the
l8rge recuperation in the condition of the
clearing house banks disclosed by the weekly
bank statement. There were two sharp
rallies on account of these factors. Neither
rally was held with any firmness and the mar
ket closed with renewed declines at many
points en realizing and sharp advances In in
dividual stocks. There was evidence of con
tinued pressure to liquidate in the opening
dÂ«allngs. most marked in the United States
Steel stocks. The preferred was carried down
2% before vigorous support rallied it. The com
mon lost V& and rallied more easily. The pre
ferred rose again l^i with the general rally in
the market, but continued under pressure.
The recent market leadersâ St. Paul, Atchison
*nd Union Pacificâ lost 1 to 2 points, but
came up vigorously when the break in corn
on the Chicago market was reported. The re
covery in corn sent prices of stocks down
again, as it was feared the movement was
more due to precautionary realizing by longs
In corn on the possibility .of Sunday rains
than to actual new* of amelioration of the
conditions in the corn belt.

Sensational reports . were published of a
i stormy interview between the two principal
representatives of the "groups which threatened
to reopen the wh61e Northern Pacific quarreL
In the absence of a formal authorized an
nouncement on the subject the inspired publi
cations designed to create assurances that all
was peace in Northern. Pacific "failed of their
purpose. The announcement by the Atchison
of an open cut in freight rates between Chi
cago and Missouri River points, to go into
effect July 15, was a proclamation of the
futility of the community of interests plan to
prevent rate contests in the very territory
where that policy had had its most striking
example. This .week's market -proves that
large speculative holdings still remained which
were boucht last June in the belief that the
community of interests plan would prevent
rate-cutting and which were unloaded Indis
criminately in the fright caused by the doubt
cast upon it. It will be seen, therefore, that
the stock market was in a weak position tech
nically. The damage to the corn crop is of
most Immediate concern to the Grangers, Pa
cifies aiid Scuthwesterns. A contributing cause
to the weakness of stocks was the threatened
strike of steel Workers.
The railroad bonds have been affected In
sympathy with stocks, but In much less de
gree. .Â«

NEW YORK, July 13. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
Â¦ NEW YORK, July 13.â The statement of the
Associated Banks for the week ending to-day
shows: Loans. $868,485,400; decrease.- $21,001,500.
Deposits, 5947,534,100; decrease, $17,719,000. Cir
culation, ?30, 629,500; Increase, $60,700. . Legal
tenders, $77,395,200; increase, $726,500. Specie,'
$172,312,700; increase, $6,448,600. Reserves, $249,
707,900; Increase, $3,175,100. Reserve*- required,
$236,898,525; decrease, $4,422,450. Surplus, $12,
809.375; Increase, $7,757,850.
The Financier eays: The statement of the
New York Associated Banks last week was
quite favorable, Indicating an expansion In
the surplus reserve compared -with the previous
week from $7,597,850 to $12,809,375. The reduc
tion of - $21,011,500 in loans was a striking fea
ture of the statement. . The decrease in this
item was doubtless principally due to the
liquidation which was in progress in stock
values during .the week, caused by speculative
manipulation, the unfavorable news concern
ing the condition of the corn crop, the threat
ened railroad war among the Western lines
and tension between the operatives and steel
manufacturers. There was probably also pome
reduction of loans by individual banks, with
a. view to the rectification of their percentage
of reserve to deposits. The gain of $3,175,100
cash closely agreed with the most liberal oi
the preliminary estimates. One notable feature
of this gain was the preponderance of specie,
due to the fact that this kind of money- is
held by banks in greater abundance than cur
rency, and therefore, . In interior bank move
ments, specie or its representative, gold cer
tificates, is preferred for transfer. The de
crease of $17,691,000 in deposits is in close cor
respondence with the changes in the loan cash
items of the statement, which together call for
a net reduction of $17,862,400, and therefore the
statement harmonizes. Taken as a whole the
bank return may be regarded as reflecting in
the improved condition of the banks the re
turn of the money disbursed to the interior for
the early July settlements of Interest and divi
dends, and through this contraction of loans
the banks are doubtless placed In a much
stronger position than has recently, appeared.
With further Improvements, which will doubt
lees be possible should nothing occur to pre
vent, the banks will most likely be able to
meet the early requirements of money for crop
purposes without difficulty, thus allaying much
of the apprehension which has recently been
felt regarding the effect of the crop demand of
the current season upon the New York banks
and Incidentally upon the money market. The
excess reserve is in fact higher than at this
period last year, and it is also to be remem
bered that bank receipts from the treasury and
through replenishments due to shipments from
Alaska will from this time on constitute an
important factor in the situation. Stories of
regular weekly exports of gold to Germany,
current last week, j are denied, and shipments,
if made, will be only Intermittent. Altogether
the statement is favorable In its revelation
of the power of the banks in making a quick
recovery from the low point reached eaxller
In the month and the apprehension manifested
at that time is seen to have been for the most
part unfounded.

DECIDUOUS FRUITS.
A dispatch to the East from this Coast says:
"The Bartlett rear crop of the present' season
is confined. to the central portion of the State,
and will be gathered and shipped mostly from
within a radius of 75 miles around Sacramento.
Districts which have heretofore made reason
ably heavy shipments, such as Anderson, Cot
tonwood, Red Bluff, Â». Biggs, etc.. on the ex
treme north, and Bakersfteld, Tulare, Visalla,
Fowler. Fresno, etc., on the extreme south, are
more, than deficient, and . in | many instances
will not be able to gather and ship a single
car load. The. supply for canning purposes is
short, and canners are making unusual efforts
to obtain their share of the fruit." -
There is nothing new in'Berrlea.
.Peaches are in rather better supply and some
what lower, but Apricots and Plums keep up
Figs are scarce again and higher. Supplies of
Nectarines are moderate and the market is
steady. Apples have not changed, for .Â¦ some
time. Pears are weaker here' but there is a
good demand for Bartletts in the country at the
price given below. .-, â¢ _ ...
Grapes and Melons continue to bring good
prices under light receipts.
The recent arrivals ""of Limes are reported
cleaned up and' the market is nominal at the

OPEN MARKET QUOTATIONS.
The. recent 1 order of things has been reversed
and the Dairy Exchange is now quoting Eggs
higher than the outside dealers. But the lat

than the Exchange. .
Stocks of Butter are now reduced to moder
ate dimensions, and the demand is reported
sufficient to keep them down. Cheese rules
firm. Eggs are in lighter supply and steady
though the demand is nothing extra.
Butter and Eggs were both advanced on the,

COAL TRUST
IS ORGANIZING
Producing and Trans
portation Companies
in Harmony.
CLEVELAND, July 13.â The Leader to
morrow will say: Owing to certain ex
pansions of the original plan having been
agreed on, the formation of the soft coal
trust may be delayed to give time for the
working out of larger. plans. The plan as
now outlined by those who are on *the
Inside provides for close harmony between
the producing and the transportation
companies. In the latter are to be in
cluded both lake, rail and ocean facilities
of the largest proportions.
It now comes out that the purchase of
the Ohio River mines reached by the Bal
timore and Ohio was a part^pf this big
scheme, and perfected in a way the con
trol of the soft coal carrying facilities for
certain parts of Ohio. West Virginia and
the Pittsburg districts. The same inter
ests now control, with the assistance of
the Morgan holdings, all of the- coal car
rying properties in this territory that ship
coal to the lakes or the East. A. fleet of
ocean-goin and lake-traversing vessels is
to be collected under the guidance of the
big combination that will be distinctly
trust boats. - \
In this connection It might be said that
more of an endeavor is to be. made to sell
the Pittsburg and "West Virginia- steam
aoals abroad- than to put them into com
petition in the Northwest -with the coals
of the same company, which are mined in .
the Illinois and Western Indiana fields.
The West being compelled to.- provide
largely for. itself In the way of coal pro
duction, the -fields of Indiana and Illinois
will be developed and the mines recently
discovered ~, in ' Indian - Territory and
that vicinity will be opened to afford
material for -the Western part of this
country.' v .
The. main hindrance to the exportation
of bituminous coal has been the lack of
do=k facilities for handling, the big boats
which heretofore have engaged â¢ In the
coaling trade. .It Is. the announced intend
tlon of the promoters of r the soft coal
trust to build a specific class of ocean go
ing tonnage which can be handled In the

SAN DIEGO, July 13.â The report comes
from the mountains above^the Julian sec
tion that during a thunder-storm- on
Thursday afternoon . lightning ; struck a
tree on the mountain east, of Julian rand
set fire to the grasa and underbrush. '..The
conflagration soon spread to the . trees.
All ranchers living in : the 'Â¦" vicinity and
many Julian people turned out and fought
the flames. After working for a day and
a half the fire was finally controlled last
night. Quite an area - of the forest was
burned, but - no damage . was done to

ropean coal receiving ports j without the
intervention of a lighter. Â¦ ' ' Â¦
'Associated directly with this scheme is
the purchase of the Pennsylvania Steel
Company by the Pennsylvania financial
interests which seem to be handling the
transportation- end of the big soft coal
deal, while the Morgan Interests take
charge-of the financing of the producing
properties.^ It is said that one of n the
plants of the Pennsylvania Steel Company
is to.be turned' Into a ship yard for the
production of ships of specific "size' that
will be able to navigate the harbors of
Southern Europe and - still carry enough
coal to make them pay.
Some have looked upon the Leyland
purchase . as the establishment of Â¦ a ' nu
cleus of" this fleet, and it is thought these
have more to do with the United", States

cial interests wfeich are behind the steel
corporation are forming an- underwriting

INDUCTED INTO
THEIR OFFICES
The flrÂ»t contract for the construction
of thÂ© Flood office building to stand on the
old Bite of the Baldwin Hotel has been
a-warded by James Ll Flood. This is for
jjulkheading. pumping, grading, trench
ing, refilling and paving. Albert Pissis
is the architect. The City Street Improve
ment Company has the contract for the
preliminary -work, the cost being $11,515.
This is the most significant move of ' the
â¢week relating: to realty. The Flood and
Crocker hotel buildings will be under con
struction simultaneously.
There is a slack season in the realty
raarket as in other lines of business, and
that season has arrived, but it will be
very brief. The coming of the Epworth
Leaguers^has distracted attention for one
thing. The vacation season is still on,
and will not end for some days yet. The
curing market for realty was good. So
will be the fall market. G. H. Umbsen &
Co. in their Beal Estate Record say that
the revival of interest in city realty,
which dales back to the purchases made
by the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific
Company, has been more than maintained
Blnce that time and during the
Hist half of the present year. It is well
that the Epworth Leaguers have come
when signs of improvement are apparent
in many Quarters. The advantage of that
iact will be manifested abundantly in the
future. They will relate what they saw
in San Francisco to many thousands in
the East upon their return.

a unique and 'interesting person.'
He is such an interesting and unique
character that we knew you'd be glad
to meet him and see what he can do.
We've fixed up for him a cozy Ori-
ental room on the second floor. He
says it reminds him so much, of Cairo
that he'll dress up as he used to.
By the way, he is a full-fledged
