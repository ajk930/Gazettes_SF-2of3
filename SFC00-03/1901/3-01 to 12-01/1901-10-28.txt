"The court cannot accept Schley's testi
mony as absolutely reliable, because in
many points it is' contradicted by not one
but a dozen witnesses," and these j were
officers whose "conduct never has been
brought into question.. The court must
now judge as to how far these witnesses
were credible and how. far the admiral,
testifying in his own behalf, shall be re
garded as a reliable witness. 1 Flat con
tradictions make the duty of the. court an
unpleasant one. "It cannot find Schley
blameless without assuming that a ma
jority, of the naval officers called bore
false } witness and should be subject to
court-martial."
" "Schley's' testimony was different from
that of all the other witnesses," said this
officer. ; "He is the subject of inquiry and
he been present to hear all the testi
mony, offered. . He has been able to com
pare .this testimony- and sum up in a gen
eral denial." Since Schley read most of
his testimony, or his counsel held a type
written copy of his testimony to correct
him should he make mistakes, it would
not be unfair to assume that It was pre
pared with the aid of counsel. It was,
therefore, a summing up of the defense
and. an argument rather than testimony.
The only real testimony by Admiral
Schley will be that under cross-examina
tion. ...

_ _ ASHINGTON, Oct. 27.-The
\\ )V / Schley Court, of | Inquiry, will
x/ \* finish taking testimony this
'* y week and ; speculation as to',
. the outcome \u25a0 is rife. Schley..
proved to be ah effective witness . before
the p'ublic. His dramatic description of
the battle of Santiago was admirable and
his friends are already. referring to it as
his vindication.' But there never has been
any question raised against Schley's con
duct at the battle of Santiago, except as
to the mischance' of the loop made by the
Brooklyn. Sampson, in his report, praised
Schley's conduct at" Santiago and left to
the Navy Department ' the question as to
how far that conduct should. wipe out his
."reprehensible conduct" preliminary to
the battle. Schley's conduct while in
command of the flying squadron i3 the
subject of inquiry, and the court will. pay
little attention to the story of the battle.
The friends of Schley are beginning to
talk about a 'Congressional . Investigation
in case the report of the court is against
him. They. do not propose to accept'any
thing short Of complete vindication and
they believe that 1 public sentiment ' will
sustain them in such demand. They. also
propose to have Congress create the rank

LONDON, Oct. 2/.â Reynolds' Weekly
newspaper is the first British paper to
assert that King Eaward Is suffering
from cancer of the throat. In to-day's
issue it declared that since the King's ac
cession three operations -have -been per
formed for the removal /'of. papilloma on
the left vocal chord and 'that one was re
moved from the right vocal chord last
week. \u25a0 \u25a0 Â£ . ' , '
'â¢ "Assistance was hastily- summoned,"
says this journal, "as his .Majesty was
breathing with difficulty 'and an immedi
ate operation was performed. . But it Is
regarded as only a temporary relief, the
injured epithelium now leaving become a
cancerous growth and ierious develop
ments are expected. h ,
Dr. McDonald replied: "I would have
liked to take the brain away, -but I am
frank to say that you are absolutely right
In the matter. If I desire to make any
examination I will do it at the prison."
TTie plan of Superintendent Collins Is
befertily acquiesced In by Warden Mead,
i/n\ It '.s understood that an unrepealed
law will be found that will allow the
"Doctor. I have planned to make this
execution an example of mystery that
will forestall any attempt at sensational
ism. I cannot allow anything to go away
from the prison that will In any; way
continue this. man's identity for notoriety.
You mj.y stay .at the prison for: a week
if you will and examine any portion of the
anatomy you please, but my present plan
is not to allow any portion of the man,
his clothing, or even the. letters be re
ceived to leave this place." . .
Wants No Sensationalism.
The death warrant has not yet been
read to the prisoner, but it will be to
morrow afternoon. The general practica
is to read the paper some time after the
preparation for the execution designed by
the ccurt. The time in this case com
mences at midnight to-night.
The firm purpose of Superintendent Col
lins and Warden Mead to avoid the ap
pearance of sensationalism in this- case
is demonstrated by an incident in con
nection with one of the principal wit
nesses. Dr. Carlos McDonald of New
York, a former president of the Sta^e
Lunacy Commission, is to be the prin
cipal attending physician at the execu
tion. He was* the alienist who examine!
Czoigosz at Buffalo and pronounced the
prisoner sane. He has been very anxious
to take away with him from the au
t*psy the assassin's brain for the pm-
ITOOi* of a microscopical examination. A
few davs ago Dr. McDonald had a talk
with Superintendent Collins and askeJ
him to allow htm. after the autopsy, to
take the brain to New York City for ex
amination. Mr. Collins said to him:
The chair in which Czolgosz will sit to
receive the deadly electrical shock was
\u25a0examir.ed and tested to-day' by State
Electrician Darts, and is ready for the
part that It is to play in the final scene
of the great national tragedy. Davis
carefully examined the wiring, switch
board and electrodues, and satisfied him-
Oelf th;it they were in good condition. He
also inspected the dynamos in the prison
ehop, â¢vrh'ere the current is generated, and
at his direction the current was for i
\u25a0brief period sent pulsating into the
death house as it will go on Tuesday
carrying final punishment to
' the asjiassin.
Electrician Da.vis will look the appa
ratus over again to-morrow and review
â¢with the prison officials the plan under
Trhich the sentence of death is to be car
ried out. CzoTgosz will be the fifty-ninth
man in the State and the fifteenth- at
Auburn Prison at whose electrocution
Davis has applied the current.
The hour of 7 on Tuesday morning *s
the tirae set by Warden J. "Warren Meail
for the execution. Various reports
changing that time have gone through
Auburn to-day and to-night. One rumor
places the time at 7 o'clock to-morrow,
but that is discredited by the fact that
Superintendent of State Prisons Cornelius
V. Collins will not arrive here until 3
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, and none
of the regularly summoned witnesses
have yet reached Auburn.
Death Chair Is Tested.
AUBCRX, X. T.. Oct. 27.â The time
that Leon Czoigosz. assassin of Presi
dent McKinley, has to live, is reckoned
by hours now, but there has been no re
laxation of the stringent rules by which
the prisoner has been secluded since hlÂ«
arrest The prison was closed to-day to
any who sought the assassin, and so It
\u25a0will remain until the prisoner has paid
the penalty that the law exacts. In fact
the pi in to deprive CzolgoEZ, living, of
any notoriety, has been extended to de
prive Czoigosz, dead, of notoriety.
Immediately after the execution the
clothirg of the prisoner, with the vast ac
cumulation of mall that came to ths
murderer will be burned, and, if possible,
the request of the parents of the dead
man for his remains will be evaded. It
Is feared that the removal of his body
to Cleveland would lead to scenes of an
unfortunate nature, and the prison offi
cials Â£.re very anxious to avoid anything
of the kind. The plan of burning the

In'addltion to these matters, Mr. Roose
velt is expected to urge the maintenance
of the status quo In the Philippines, and
"the enactment of more stringent immi
gration laws, which will. enable the ex
clusion of undesirable aliens and tlM re
enactment of the Chinese exclusion aot> .
Ship Subsidy Billâ The need of augmen
tation of the merchant marine is .well
known to the country and Mr. Roosevelt
will' dwell' with' emphasis upon it.' He
will not . commit himself to the indorse
ment of any measure. In fact, speaking
of this subject .a few days ago, Mr.
Roosevelt said to a member of Congress
that he did not believe it thj duty of the
1-rcsident to recommend specific legisla
tion. His duty was to point out the need
and leave Congress to furnish the
remedy.
' Navyâ By reason of : his service In the-
Navy .Department, Mr. Roosevelt takes'
deep interest. in the navy. He has al
ready dictated a very strong essay on the'
need of a strong navy. He will earnestly
urge the adoption of a formidable ship
building programme, which shall Include
â¢battleships. Outlying dependencies must
! be protected and the command of the sea
is : essential i to their preservation to the
United^ States. A large navy is also nec
essary'for the defense of the Monroe doc
trine. This will be an especially strong
feature of the message.
Isthmian Canalâ Mr. Roosevelt will call
attention to the report of the Isthmian
Canal Commission, which will be sub
mitted to him about the middle of No
vember. He is an ardent advocate of the
canal and will earnestly urge action. He
will also refer to the negotiation of the
treaty with Great Britain, which removes
all obstacles in the way of American con
struction of the canal, and will urge Its
ratification.

of Ihis â¢ Cabinet * a statement "of "the work
of his department and the important rec
ommendations he proposed to Incorporate
in his annual report. A portion of this
statement would be used and Mr. Mc-
Kinley would call attention to the recom
mendations. Mr. Roosevelt has been
supplied by members of the Cabinet with
data, such as was given to Mr. McKin
ley, but he Is paraphrasing them.
Trusts the Main Feature.
Mr. Roosevelt . does .not write with a
pen. He dictates sometimes to Secretary
Cortelyou, sometimes to Assistant Secre
tary Loeb and again to Assistant Seere*-'
tary Barnes. -His message is not, of
course, - completed. It will be necessary
to revise it this week, when he learns the
views of his Cabinet, and events may
cause changes and additions before it is
finally transmitted to Congress.
These will be some of the important
matters discussed by Mr. Roosevelt:
Reciprocity â Mr. Roosevelt will make a
g*eneral statement of the necessity of re
ciprocity, but it is not expected that he
will make a specific recommendation of
treaties negotiated.
Trusts â The President feete strongly on
this subject and it is his purpose to de
vote a considerable portion of his mes
sage to it. - At the same time, he will not,
though he will urge legislation, present
any plan for a determination of this im-i
portant question. If he follows the view
of the Department of Justice, he will
urge the amendment of the Sherman law
so as to provide machinery for the prose
cution of trusts, . makin ; it compulsory
for them. to show to government officials,
on demand, copies of their contracts and
agreements, and authorizing the employ
ment of agents to make an Investigation.
Mr. Roosevelt will â¢ not indorse this rec
ommendation, so .far, as is now known J
and may not even call attention to It. :
In his method of writing the message
he has pursued a different course from
that of the late Mr. McKinley. The lat

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. X.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â President
Roosevelt has informed the members of
his Cabinet that he will read to them for
criticism during the present week his
first annual message to Congress.
This document is briefer than any mes
sage yet transmitted and it probably will
be compressed Into still smaller compass.
Mr. Roosevelt does not propose to burden
the people with a lengthy document, the
sight of which will appall them. It Is his
opinion that a message briefly but
strongly discussing each of the important
Questions engrossing the attention of the
country -will be what the nation wants.

Special Dispatch to. The Call,
, CORNING, Oct. ... 27.â William Bailey
was found dead near the railroad track
at the north end of town early this morn
ing 'and", his passing fiom life Is hedged
about with Just enough mystery to puzzle
the county . authorities. The. manner of
the man's death is v now being investi
gated. â¢
According to the testimony of a num
ber of. persons here Bailey indulged to a
considerable degree In"- intoxicating drink
last- night. With him was a companion
to-- whom he made known "his purpose to
commit suicide. It Is stated by .those who
watched the; actions and heard the con
versation of the two -men that Bailey's
friend said he also waa tired of life and
would gladly join In . the tragio business
of self-destruction. . : ' ,
-The men left the saloon where both had
been drinking and walked-a short; dis
tance down the railrbad track. Bailey
drew a revolver and spoke again of sui
cide.- His companion, either from fear or
a ' return of good judgment, changed his
mind and; put as much distance between
himself and Bailey as his fieetness of foot
would permit. ' , ; ...
All that Bailey did between the time of
the friend's reconsideration and abrupt
departure and the former's . death is a
matter of conjecture; but it is generally
considered that he took his own life.
There is,- however, \u25a0 one circumstance
which appears to disturb the theory of
self destruction. This is that no powder
burns are to be found near ' the place
where the bullet entered. The authorities
are disposed to attach some j importance
to this fact -and suspect that -there may
have been foul play. â¢ \u25a0 ,

Elliott, who is a native of Lancashire.

the latter had placed his (Sherman's) wife
in a house of ill-fame. Elliott, in ex

says that in San Francisco five years
ago beside the dead father of Bessie Bray,
then 13 years old, and in the presence of
her mother, he raised his right hand and
swore that v.o harm should ever befall the !
girl. Though boy and girl, they werÂ«
plighted lovers. He says about a ; ;year
ago the- girl married J. W. Sherman.
Three weeks ago while at Oxnard, he, 1

VANCOUVER, B. C.', Oct. 27.â The se

shelter, and 'the steamers New England

During Tuesday, night, wh'en-'the gale
from the westward was at its, height
heavy' seas' broke over the Uapitaho" and
she was in much danger of! being*caxried
on the rocks.' The New England cruised
around for five days before she found : it
possible to lower her boats* and
was reported a week overdue when she
arrived in port this evening. . â¢ '*.-.;"'\u25a0â¢

Breclal Dispatch to The Call.
UKIAH, Oct. 27,â This morning such
early risers as chanced to stroll aroun-J
the Courthouse square in this city; no
ticed a long-rope pendant ftfom, the roof
of the, County Jail and reaching to the
ground. An investigation followed,, an.1
it -was- discovered that four prisoners haJ
escaped i from Jail during the night. The
surprise was- great, as heretofore the jail
has been considered perfectly safe.
The- four- who escaped' were' George Mi
chael, awaiting trial for horse stealing;
Fred 'Housman, awaiting trial for for- :
gery; Jim Dempsey, serving time for petty
larceny, and Lorenzo Jeff, a half -tree J
.Indian, committed for battery. Five other
prisoners; refused to escape. . ." \u25a0.*'. '\u25a0-.
The manner of escape .was ingenious
but simple. . .Within the main room of the
Jail there, is a targe cage of crossed bats
of steel, and into this tne cells open. On
three sides thU cage does not touch the
wall. Trie prisoners were not locked in
their cells, but were allowed the joint
use of the Jarge space of the cag. j .
Along the east end .of the cage is a
movable bathtub. A few days ago the
cement floor beneath -this tub was broken
up to "fix some defect in the plumbing,
.and the broken part was mended with
fresh cement.
' Removing the tub, the prisoners, with
a wire shovel and caseknives, dug and
broke-out. a hold in. the cement and crawl
ed urider the steel 'grating to the corridor,
which-, surrounds the cage. They found a
large sea-grass mat of the kind which la
first made into a kind of rope and then
coiled from the- center outward. Cutting
the stitches which held this together,
they coiled a strong 1 rope some sixty f e ;t
long. Next' they, climbed to the top o^
the cage, threw the rope over the steel
girders, about twelve feet above, and
pulled tnemselves up. Standing on the
girders, they opened a pane of the sky
light, climbed ro the roof, let down their
rope on the outside and . descended hand
under hand.
They broke through the cement floor
about 9 o'clock, but did not complete the
escape until about 2 o'clock this morning,
'as reported by the remaining prisoners.
The night was very stormy, and on ac
count of a burned-out dynamo the streets
were not lighted. It was a most favorable
night for the attempt. Sheriff Smith im
mediately sent deputies out on all roads,
but at this, hour none of the escaped men
have been overhauled.

An instance of the way South African
news is being "doctored" for the benefit
of the public and the Stock Exchange was
afforded when the papers all announced
in large headlines that one British column
had brought in 250 prisoners to Kleerks
dorp, October, 17. Following .this sensa

that the net result of sweeping operations
by four or five British columns through

capture of 250 fugitives, thirty-seven of

Several weeks now having passed with

the opinion is gaining ground that the

LONDON, Oct. 27.â The Stock Exchange
had another dull / experience last weeK,
without any appreciably brighter outlook
for the near future. The money market
was the most interesting: feature of the
situation. The threatened drain of gold
to Paris materialized and the open market
rate responded, advancing from 2% to 3.
A considerable quantity of gold was taken
out of the bank, creating some popular^de
mand and an increase in the offlciaUrate
of discount f
In view of the fact that the gold reserve
Is now under Â£25,000,000, an advance in the
rate is very probable,, but there is noth
ing to indicate when it will be made. The
same factors which deterred speculation
In the week previous continued to operate

After attacking Senor Silvela, the Con
servative leader, for advocating an alli
ance between France and Spain, Senor
Romero attacked General Weyler for in
specting the forts in the neighborhood- of
Gibraltar without due cause. He declared
that these actions were "imprudent and
dangerous as tending to create an'appre
hension. In a powerful country which has
always advocated Spanish predominance

shortly resign the Premiership owing to

bate." â¢ : ; .
I am a politician and a Liberal, but before
all I am a soldier; and if it should become
necessary I will defend our Institutions and
Parliament.
Senor Romero rejoined:
I take -note of the declarations of the Min
ister of War on the subject o( a. dictatorship.
Loud and prolonged uproar interrupted
the Minister of War, and several of his
Finlsteriai colleagues were unable to re
strain expressions of surprise at his
v.-ords. Resuming, Weyler baid:
. I have always faithfully observed discipline,
and he who talks of dlctatorthip Is the enemy
cf discipline. Our recent maneuvers have
proved that good feeling exists between the
people and the army, as for dictatorship, no
one thinks of such a thing. Dictators are the
offspring of circumstances. For myself I may
Kay this: I huve never thought of being one,
nor do I now. Nevertheless, If -my aid were
asked at a moment of gravity I do not know
how I should decide between my political and
military duties, but I should always incline to
ward the latter.
MADRID, Oct. 27.â During yesterday's
sitting of the Spanish Chamber of Depu
ties, which proved sensational, Senor
Romero y Robledo cleverly led the Min
ister of War, General Weyler, to define
his attitude and intentions. General Wey
ler declared that while the war in Cubi
lasted his views were totally distinct
from those of the Liberal party, but that
when the war was at an end the motive
for separation disappeared and he saw
nothing to prevent him attaching him
self to a Liberal Government. Weyler

or is billed in the records of the bank

District Court. His liabilities were placed
at $16,400 and his assets at $9900.
The names of thirty-seven creditors ap

the creditors is W. A. Clark Jr. of Butte,

scenery and costumes in various theaters.
Another 'item is the copyright of a play,
"With Other Eyes," valued at $1000.
Clay Clement is well known all over the
Pacific Coast and has many friends and
acquaintances in San Francisco. His last
appearance here was about eighteen
months ago, when, \u25a0 with his own com
pany, he presented "The New Dominion"
and "The Bells" at the Columbia Theater.
At the close of that engagement he toured
Australia with Nance O'Neill. Clement

Whether the outbreak predicted for the

\u25a0doubtful.
When Senator Beveridge was in Shang
hai he interviewed a number of mission
aries who had visited interior points as
to the feelings of the people toward for
eigners. This feeling, bitter before the
Boxer outbreak, has grown more hostile
as a result of the conduct of the allied
powers. Mr. Beveridge asked them if they
feared another outbreak. All replied In
the affirmative. As to the;'tlme of its oc
currence, some said two. some three and
others five years. The last estimate was
regarded as extreme.
France has already begun the concession
irovement by negotiating a convention
with China in regard to railway rights in
lanunan. Germany has shown no dispo
sition to withdraw her garrisons at Shang
hai and her steamers are plowing Yang
tsse-Kiang River and are endeavoring to
take away from the English the trade of
the populous region watered by the
stream. Germany is also taking measures
to increase her interests in the province of
Shantung. \
Dangerous as such a condition would be
to the territorial Integrity of China, the
prospect of Its development Is not more
menacing to the Chinese entity than the
present attitude of certain European
powers. Pledged. as her revenues are to
the payment of the indemlty demanded by
the powers for the Boxer outrage, further
monetary demands upon China, for out
ri.ges committed upon foreigners cannot
be granted and concessions will have to
bÂ« made instead. . These concessions. It is
apprehended here, \u25a0will take the form of
territorial grants.

a Pottawatomie by birth, but was
brought up by the Sacs. When the Sacs
were driven from lower Lake Huron by
the. Iroauois they went to the region of
Green Bay, where- they were joined by
the Foxes, and afterward the two tribes
inhabited both sides of the Mississippi
River from Wisconsin to Missouri His

By a. treaty with chiefs of the Sacs "and
Koxes at Prairie du Chien July 15 lgao
their land east of the Mississippi wa ,'
ceded to the whites. Black Hawk refused
to consent and in 1831 made an attack on
some Illinois villages and the following
year massacred whites. He was defeated
at Wisconsin River July 31, 1832, and again
(August 2 at Bad Ax, River, when he was
cr.ptured | and the war ended. > He was
confined at Jefferson Barracks. Mo an*
in April, 1833. he was, with other chief a

where he was restored to freedom after
having promised never to raise his hand
against the whites. He was taken on the

BIG GUNSâ G. V. T.. Oakland, Cal. ,It
is claimed that a thlrteen-inch gun on
board of a war vessel could be loaded and
fired twice a minute, but such would not
be the case in an engagement.^ While
rapidity is . desired, accuracy must be
taken Into consideration. Shots from a
thlrteen-lnch gun are not fired off as art
firecrackers, just to make a noise. It Is
the aim of the officers in charge to make
each shot tell. During the battle off San
tiago, the vessels "of the United States
navy fired one round from eight-inch gun
once in four minutes.
TWO RUNS-F. S. S., City. In cribbage
it matters not in what order cards are
played in order to count a run, so long
as trie cards can be counted in consecu
tive order, without an intervening card
appearing. If the play was 6â3â7â4â3
that makes a run of five because the
cards can be counted 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. If the
next play was. a duce then there would
be a run of 6. If however a oard that
would not make a sequence, as for in
stance there had been played a trey or a
ten after the seven, there would not have
been a run.

The reason assigned by Mr. Edson for the flop
was not less farcical than the flop itself. The petition,
or demand, for a rehearing came from the railroad]
but Mr. Edson said # ht : granted the rehearing for the
sake of giving the oil men a chance to introduce more
evidence. Did ever a clown utter a greater absurdity?
The. public would like to have a heart to heart talk
with Edson, one of the kind of talks that Herrin has
with himâ a sort of searching talk that .reaches him
in the right place. It would like to learn from him
whether he really believes he is deceiving the public
by his pretense that he has granted a rehearing to the
railroad solely for the purpose of doing more sub
stantial justice to the oil men. It would like to know
just why Mr. Edson voted to vacate the. act reducing
rates before the new hearing is had. If, upon the
evidence submitted to him at the first hearing of the
case, Mr. Edson deemed.it right to reduce rates, why
does he now set the reduction aside without further
evidence. If the railroad have made. a sufficient
showing for a rehearing why does not Mr. Edson
grant the rehearing on that showing instead of grant
ing it,: as he says, for the sake of giving the oil men
a hearing? If the railroad have not made a sufficient
showing for a rehearing why does: Mr. Edson grant
it at all? Why does he drag the oil men in when
they did '.not wish; to come in? . Is it that -he in
tends to force a benefit on them? '
Whether the commission costs the Southern Pacific
Company more money, than it costs the State of
California we know, not," but of one thing We are
certainâ the work done by the commission is worth a
great deal more to the 1 road than to the State; so
that if the cost to the road is five times that im
posed on the people the road is still getting the bet
ter of the bargain. The public has long noted that
every, time a Commissioner flops he flops "agin the
people."
The project for draining the Zuyder Zee of which

It is reported from London that a difficulty is

When those astute railroad Democrats; Burke and

they ought at least to have made it harmonious and

HUDSON'S SECOND THOUGHT.
OVER and over again The Call has had occa
sion to point out to the people facts tend-,
ing to the conclusion that the Railroad Com
mission obtains from the Southern Pacific Company's
law office the decision which the commission is called
upon to. make in any important case that comes be
fore it. Upon one occasion, indeed, the decision
seems to have been handed over to the commission
not from the iaw office direct, but from the dining
room of the residence of W. F. Herrin. It is now
necessary to once more direct attention. to new facts
tending to the same conclusion.
When a majority of the Commissioners decided the
oil rate case in such 0 way as to give a slight reduc
tion in rates on oil between Bakersfield and this city
there was a little flutter of surprise among the peo
ple. Something utterly unexpected had happened.
It seemed that the commission had for once found a
decision without consulting the railroad law office.
The, reduction made was very slight, but still it was
a reduction, and among the oil men there was a con
sciousness of victory. â¢
The oil men, however, were mistaken. Why the
commission reduced rates we* do not know, but it is
now evident that it acted unadvisedly, for the railroad
has petitioned or demanded a rehearing and the com
mission has promptly declared its former action in
valid and put the rates back where they were before.
There is to be a rehearing of the case and, perhaps, a
redining at Mr. Herrin's residence; and then there
will be another decision. It remains to be seen
whether after that decision the smile will be on- the
face of the oil men or on that of the railroad. ' .
The" old farce plays itself over and over, again. In
this particular instance it has presented a new stunt
that of Mr. Edson performing a flip-flop. That Com
missioner was one of the majority that reduced the
oil rate's. He is also one of the majority that invalid
ated the reduction. His colleague, Laumeister," who
voted with him for-the reduction, was not present
when the vote for invalidation was taken. Mr. Ed-
From;the attention which King Edward is giving
to the details of the coronation ceremonies it seems
that he has made up his mind that since he had to
wait for it so long he is going to have it now" just
exactly as he chooses.
It is now reported that Sir Thomas Lipton has
been rash enough to say he will never marry until
he has lifted the America's cup, so it would seem
that any girls who may have been setting theircaps
for him might just as well look in another .direction.
The municipal! contest has now shaped itself*- so
clearly that every one can. understand it. There is
a ticket to represent those who favor class politics,
another ticket pledged to corporations, anicT then
there, is the ticket that stands for the whole people
and the public good.
A New York physician who has just returned home
after a prolonged tour of observation around", the
world is quoted as saying that the most thorough
ly modern hospitals to be found anywhere are those
of Japan. Here is another proof that travelers see
strange things and possibly also^a proof that travelers
sometimes lie.
GENERAL trade was less active last week.
The bank clearings of the country were only
14.8 per cent larger than for the correspond
ing week in 1900, which is the smallest gain for some
time. But every city of size showed an increase,
though the gains in all were smaller than has been
the rule of late. The failures were 240, against 205
last i:ear.
No particular line is responsible for this slight de
crease in the volume of business last week. It seemed
to be general rather than special, but it* was not-suf
ficiently pronounced to cause unfavorable comment.
In fact, the business of the country was so brisk that
there were not cars enough to handle the freight of
fered. This condition has prevailed for a year or
more and is hampering trade from Maine to Califor
nia. The railroads are ordering new cars fa^t
enough, but the iron and steel trade has been so
lushed for several years that the different works have
been unable to supply the demand. Nor is there any
immediate prospect of a slackening up in the iron
trade. The Pennsylvania Railroad last week placed
an order 'for 160,000 tons of steel rails, the largest
order of the year, 'and this! with other orders for rails,
has run the total amount booked for 1002 delivery up
to 1,500,000 tons. This does not indicate any lack of
actirity in the iron and steel business.
The other staples 3re also sending in good reports.
Shoe shipments are largely in excess of a year ago,
and leather is from 5 to 10 per cent higher than in
September, while hides are strong and active all over
the country. Woolen mills are fully occupied and
are buying raw wools liberally at firm prices. The
cotton crop has begun to move more freely, which
has led to prompter Southern collections. The move
ment in coal is retarded by lack of cars. Provisions
are unsettled at Chicago and other Western centers,
and the general tendency in both hog's and cured
meats is downward, as the recent high prices checked
consumption. Wheat has taken an upward turn,
chiefly on account of serious damage to the Argen
tine crop by drought, and quotations have been
slowly advancing for some days. Flour has sympa
thized with wheat, and the output is heavy, the Min
neapolis mills breaking all records last week. The
general wholesale and jobbing trade of the country
is reported good, though hardly as lively as it has
been for some time. Sales of fancy goods for the
Christmas holidays are unusually early, indicating an
expected heavy business in this direction.
A good sign is the liberal ordering by railroads of
steel to replace wooden work. This shows that the
railroads are on a good basis and are now in a po
sition to build with a view. to solidity and permanence.
Coupled with the general shortage in cars just men
tioned, this looks as if the railroads were doing a
rushing business.
Conditions in the local market remain about as be
fore. All lines, except several farm products, such
as hops, dried fruits and the minor cereals, including
barley, are reported active, and generally at good
prices. The outward movement of -wheat has im
proved materially, owing largely to a ifcarked decline
in ocean freights and a simultaneous- improvement
in the price of wheat abroad. Merchants who handle
general merchandise report the demand steady and
large. Passengers on the ferry-boats see many more
vessels in the bay than in recent years, and they are all
moving about Collections in all lines are reported
good, and there are no failures large enough to at
tract attention. . The present year, taken all in all, is
one of the best that the farmers have had for some
time, and the city trade reflects this prosperity in a
brisk commerce, both local and foreign. We are do
ing about as well as we ever did, which is saying a
good deal, and there are no indications of any fall
ing off in business. V

JULES VERNE, who is reported to have become totally blind at his home
in Amiens, has been a sufferer with deficient eyes for a long time. The
great romancer of science Is now in his seventy-thii'd year, but he has
never ceased his literary work, even after his sight began to fall. He
published a novel only three years ago, and, although this did not bear
the vigorous stamp of his early, work, if was by no. means weak. M. Verne re
cently distinguished himself by declining a seat in the French. Academy for the.
second time. He began his literary career as a dramatist and for thirteen
years labored successfully in that field as a writer of comedies. It was 'not un- â¢
til 1863 that he published the first of the stories upon which his fame was to rest.
This was "Five Weeks in a Balloon." j Itj immediate and rebounding success in
duced M. Verne to continue to exploit himself in this, direction and. the result
was .that widely read series of romances which have delighted the world, young
and old, for thirty years or more. M. Verne's chief amusement since his youth
has been yachting. " He owns a fine steam yacht and his happiest days have
been those spent on its decks.

During a race between seven torpedo
boat destroyers off Margate, October 7, the
Angler and Salmon collided and a terrible
calamity was narrowly averted. The boats
were within thirty yards of each other
when rounding the lightship, the Angler
being inside the Salmon's course: both
boats were under forced draught, and it
appeared that the Angler was In danger
of ramming the Salmon. The latter real
ized her peril and starboarded her helm,
but the momentum of the Angler was too
great and the Salmon's stern caught the
other's starboard quarter, completely
sweeping the after deck. The Angler's
propellers were thrust through the Sal
mon's side, rending the thin plates like
cardboard. Only two men were Injured,
but the boats, brought in in a sinking con
dition into Sheerness, will require very ex
tensive repairs
The floating dock built at Baltimore foe,
the naval station at Algiers, near New
Orleans, has been completed and has
started on its long voyage for Its destina
tion, which It may reach, barring acci
dents, in about twenty-five days. Another
floating dock, that at Havana, is slated
for a much longer voyage, but the time
for its departure for the Philippines ha3
not been fixed. This dock was built in
England for the Spanish Government at
a cost of $345,000 and towed to Havana in
1897 at a cost of $25,000. It was purchased
by the United States last July for J1S5.000,
with the Intention of locating the dock at
Subig Bay in the Philippines. The
structure is said to be in good condition
and only about 150,0000 will be required to
put it in perfect working order, but the
expense of towing the dock nearly 12,000
miles via the Suez canal will be very
heavy. The cost has been estimated as
low as $30,000, but as the canal dues will
not be less than $10,000 It is evident that
coal, vessels for towing and other neces
sary outlays will largely exceed this low
estimate. "The dock is capable of lifting

Last January at a banquet at the Palace Hotel Mr. Wells said: "The Supervisors 1
believe are the best board we ever had in this city. In the forty-eight years I have lived in
this city I have known of no such board as we now have."
The board deserved the commendation thus given by Mr. Wells: It has received
substantially the same commendation from the great mass of the intelligent people of the
city. Most of its members have been renominated. The Call supports them because they
deserve re-election. Their defeat would mean the betrayal of the city into the hands of
those men whom Mr. Wells has declared to be unfit and who are known. to be : pledged
to the worst elements in alliance with Herrin. The appeal therefore goes to the civic
patriotism of tlie citizens: Vote for the men who have been tried .and found true; and
down the tools of the corporations and. the advocates ,of. a wide, open tow'nÂ£ ; _ *Â£
..-: \u25a0" -r r Finally it is just as well to remind Mr, Wells that he was nominated \ by the same
convention .that nominated the Supervisor ticket of which he is ashamed. >--\u25a0-'
The issue in the contest for Supervisors is that of saving San Francisco from be
ing looted. Mr. Wells spoke like a man of true civic patriotism when he said that if he
had known what kind of men were to be nominated on the Herrin ticket for Supervisors
he would no more have accepted the nomination than he would have given up his hope
of going to heaven. There is no possible defense for such a ticket, no sufficient palliation
of its offensiveness, no satisfactory apology for its nomination. It* is not a Republican
ticket. It is a Herrin and Burke ticket, a Goldberg and Gunst ticket; a ticket that means
loot. .- ,
Herrin has surrounded himself with the worst elements in Sari Francisco. He is
backed in this, fight not only by Jere Burke and Sam Rainey of the Democratic camp,
but by Mose Gunst and Max Goldberg. His success would mean the opening up of the
town to pretty nearly every form of vice and iniquity that has money in it. .The schemes
of the gas company and the water company and the Southern Pacific Company would
be jostled by* the jobs that Gunst and Goldberg delight in. Everything from the City
Treasury to the Police Department would be in the hands of the looters. The Supervis
ors would do what Herrin commanded, and Herrin would command whatever meant
money for the .vicious and debased gang that is supporting him in the fight.
The ticket of Supervisors which revolted Mr. Wells for a moment and The Call per
manently is pledged to a wide open town, to the schemes of the gas and the water com
pany and to whatever else Mr. Herrin may demand. That charge has been made over
and over in language even more specific than we now state it, and yet it has never been
denied by Mr. Wells, by Mr. Herrin, nor by the Herrin nominees for Supervisor. /
The issue raised by the nomination of such a set of Supervisor candidates under
such domination is one which no decent citizen of San Francisco can afford to overlook
or ignore. The election of that set of men would surrender San Francisco to the looting
of every kind of looters from corrupt corporations to tin horn gamblers and poolroom'
touts. '\u25a0-\u25a0'\u25a0.'. . \u25a0 -
MR. ASA R:; WELLS said in his speech on Saturday evening that he was nom
inated by the Republican party and that The Call; opposes him because the
proprietor of N The Call was not permitted toMominate the Republican conven
tion.' From that statement it is evident that either Mr. Wells has a very
short memory or else he is utterly reckless of what he says.
When soliciting the support of The Call, which was refused him, Mr. Wells stated
to the proprietor in the presence of Mr. Grove P. Ayers'that if he had seen the list of niert
who were to be nominated as Supervisors on his ticket he would not have accepted the
nomination for Mayor. In repeating that statement substantially to a representative of
The Call for publication, he said: "If I had seen the list of names I would no more- have
accepted the nomination for Mayor than give up my hope of going to heaven
. That is Mr. Wells' opinion of the men whose nomination for Supervisors was
dictated to the so-called Republican convention by the Democratic railroad bosses, W. F.
Heron and Jere Burke. If Mr. Wells would not have accepted the nomination on such
a ticket, had he known what it" was going to be, why should he expect The Call to sup
port the. ticket now that the character of its membership is known?'
The Burke and Herrin ticket of Supervisors is not only bad in its personnel, being
composed in the main of persons utterly unfit for the office, but it is rendered worse by the
pledges imposed upon it and by the character of the domination to which it is subject.

The sermon was preached by Father
Guibert, who took for his subject, "The
Cult of Mary in France." The reverend
speaker traced the influence of- the
Blessed Virgin through successive ages
by a reference to the history of France.
He showed how her grace had' been
manifested In the conversion of King
Clovis and Emperor Charlemagne in the
early ages. He then referred to her in
fluence during the rise of the Albigenses,
when v St. Thomas Aquinas and St.
Francis of Assisium did so much for the
uplifting of the Christian church. He
treated of the reformation and after-
Ward of the reign of Louis XIII, when
that monarch dedicated France toÂ» the
Blessed Virgin. The speaker concluded
by pointing to the fact that notwith
standing the many vicissitudes through
which France had passed she is Btill a
Catholic country and the motto, . the
"Kingdom of France, , the Kingdom' of
Mary," is being exemplified to this very
day.

entrance to the pavilion as unostenta
tiously as possible. He received a rous
ing welcome when he appeared on the
stage, and loud and prolonged cheers
greeted him when he was introduced to
speak by Chairman Gould.

The tremendous force displayed by Asa
R. Wells in his discussion of the cam
paign issues at Metropolitan Temple Sat
urday night was the subject of consider
able comment in political circles yester
day. On the occasion of his first public
address a week ago, Mr. Wells made a
big hit by stultifying his own party, and
he repeated the break he made on that
occasion in his second attempt at
oratory. ,
Notwithstanding the efforts of Man
ager Cobb to curb his employer's propen
sity to talk arrant nonsense on the plat
form, Mr. Wells continues to do his own
sweet will whenever he appears on the
rostrum. With every appearance before
the public the Republican candidate for
Mayor weakens his candidacy, so that
few Republicans are to be found who do
not regard his election . as being prac
tically hopeless.
A leading Republican said yesterday
that Mr. Wells lacked those qualifica
tions which one naturally looked for in
a candidate for so important and digni
fied an office as Mayor of San Francisco.
Without the ability to express himself,
even in the most ordinary way, upon
topics with which he should be familiar,
he has the faculty of weakening his own
case by announcing his intention to do
certain things and then forgetting to keep
hi3 promise. At the meeting Saturday
evening he was to have declared himself
as to his policy In the event of his elec
tion. Instead of doing this he told his
hearers that he had the example of the
immortal Lincoln and McKinley con
stantly before him, and that in all ; the

WELLS WEAKENS HIS CASE.
Frank Gould, chairman of the meeting,
and Candidates John H. Wise, Judge
Charles T. Conlan, Laurence J. Dwyer,
Justus S. Wardell, Joseph Fassler, Judge
Alfred J. Fritz, Samuel Braunhart, Maur
ice V. Samuels, Lewis F. Byington, George
Dahlbender, Dr. Thomas B.'W. Leland and
Franklin IC Lane also delivered - short
addresses.
We say to-day the enemy is before us. It Is
a crisis in the political career of San Fran
cisco, and the Question is whether you will
submit to the domination of the corporations
or support men who have done. their duty faith
fully and who now stand upon a platform for
honest government. I say you should support
the men who Have never faltered in their duty
as honest and conscientious citizens.
Mr. Tobin then briefly related the story
of Paul Revere and his appeal to our fore
fathers to defend their firesides, . the en
emy being before them. He continued:
Crisis in City's Career. !
I am not a politician. I am not in public
life seeking: to climb higher up > the ladder;
seeking for some future political preferment.
I hope to do my duty if elected and retire
absolutely from politics at the end- of my term
of office. My only object *in public life Is to
discharge what I deem my duty to the citi
zens oÂ£ San Francisco.
these results to support men dominated and
controlled by the corporations?
In speaking of himself and his can
didacy for Mayor. Mr. Tobin said:
walks of his life he sought to emulate
them. Then, instead of telling why "the
twin Benedict. Arnolds of the press"
were opposing his candidacy, he merely
charged that "De Young and Spreckete
opposed him because they were not al
lowed to dominate the convention."
Wells Mixes Matters.
With becoming modesty he referred to
franchises and public, utilities as being
momentous questions, and in the next
breath he remarked with refreshing can
dor that "the Mayor should be above
th?se petty questions." His most re
markable statement was that the people
ought to take the Mayor on trust, and
that he asked for the popular suffrage on
that account, evidently forgetting that In
taking him on trust the people would nec
essarily have â¢ to take Kelly and Herrin
on trust also. The audience, was yearn
ing for more of the same sort, but In
stead of supplying it, Mr. "Wells began to
ramble in the mazes of generalities IlkÂ©
a lad delivering a badly memorized ad
dress. The audience began to leave the
hall before he had finished his two-min
ute speech, and it was observed that the
cheers given at the close of the meeting
lacked the enthusiasm which Short
ridge's speech had momentarily aroused.
The supporters of the Republican ticket
are experiencing that panicky feeling
which is the result of premonitions of de
feat: All. along the line are the signs
which point to Tobin as the people's
choice for Mayor on November 5, and
there is much despondency in the Re
publican camp in consequence. The Re
publican County Committee has issued
Instructions to Its workers in behalf of
the ticket to leave no stone unturned to
secure the election of Wells, even at the
expense of the remainder of the tickt. In
other words, the orders of a week ago to
knife the Supervisors in the interests of
Wells have been reiterated. This move
is regarded as the only one now possible
to insure the election of the head of the
ticket.-
Tobin Adherents Active. â¢
The Tobin adherents say they will not
be caught napping in the eleventh hour,
and now that the Democracy is working
harmoniously in the Interest of the Dem
ocratic ticket, an Immense advantage 13
thereby secured. The reports from the
field indicate that Tobin's candidacy is
growing stronger every day. His manly
addresses, free from vituperation and
bitterness, are making themselves felt in
all quarters. Mr. Tobin may not be a
Cicero, but he speaks with intelligence
and force, and every address made by
him means an accumulation of more votes
for himself and the ticket of which he is
the head.
The call recently Issued by prominent
Germans for a mass meeting in the in
terests of Tobin for Mayor has precipi
tated statements to the effect that many
of the men signing the call are not vot
ers. At a meeting of the German-Ameri
can Club Friday evening 1 , at which Mr.
Wells was present, D. B. Faktor said
that the men who were supporting Tobin
were not voters. Oscar Hocks, one of the
signers of the call, resented this as being
untrue, and the Registrar was appealed
to for data, concerning the gentlemen's
qualifications as electors. That official
responded with the information that the
following named gentlemen who signed
the call are voters: Oscar Hocks, TV. J.
G. Muhl, Charles A. Zinkand, H. M.
Wreden, August Hansen, Emil Pohli, W.
J. Hess. A. C. Wieland, Franz Kuckeln
and Robert Capelle.
Another Case of Roosevelt
Tobln's campaign has been the cleanest
In the history of San Francisco. His
courteous treatment of. those whose op
position to him has expressed itself in
petty personalities' has won for hlm'hosts
of friends. His frankness, independence
and unlimited capacity for hard work
have inspired confidence on all hands. The
qualities he has shown as a campaigner
are the very qualities demanded in the
chief executive of a modern metropolis.
He has worked vigorously, but with dis
cretion ;-has been frank without hurting
anybody's feelings; has shown infinite
tact under trying circumstances; has
shown his ability to meet emergencies and
has convinced all who have met him of
his absolute sincerity.
This is a summary of the opinions freely
expressed yesterday by men of all shades
of political faith.
"It's another case of Roosevelt," said
one man.
Tobln will address meetings to-night In
the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirty
sixth, Thirty-seventh, Forty-second and
Forty-third Assembly districts. He will
speak in Golden Gate Hall, Park View
Hall, at Ninth avenue and H street, and
in Pioneer Hall on Fourth street.

NEW . ANNOUNCEMENT.
HAIB WON'T I 1 ALT, OUT.
If- You "Kill the Dandruff Germ "With
the New Treatment.
John N. Fuller, a well known citizen of
Coif ax, Wash., says: "I had dandruff so
badly that v lt caked on my scalp. Herpi-
cide completely cured me." . George H.
McWhirk of Walla Walla, Wash., says:
"Herpicide completely cured me of a bad
case of dandruff of 30 years' standing."
They took the only really sensible treat-
ment,' a remedy that destroys the dan-
druff germâ Newbro's Herpicide. Stop
dandruff, hair won't fall out, but will
grow naturally, luxuriantly. Allays Itch-
ing instantly and makes hair glossy and
soft as silk. At druggists. One bottle
will convince any doubter of its merits.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27.â Bad throws
beat Sacramento to-day in a game which
was snappy for five innings. The muddy
field was responsible for â¢ many wild
throws and made good base running im
possible. Five double plays enlivened the
game. Levy presented the Senators with
their only run by calling Sullivan's toy!

: The champion has - been accustomed to
the single-handed game. When play, be
came exciting and there was. a point to
be scored or a ball "killed" he gave no
heed to - his partner, but went after it.
He was /all over the court, and despite
his lack of practice stood the severe strain
of "the match well. -
JAMES F. FITZGERALD, champion
handball player of the. world,
proved his right. to that , title yes
terday at Phil ' Ryan's 'court. ' With
James C. .Nealon as partner he eas
ily defeated Hampton and Collins. The
little amphitheater on Howard street was
crowded to the point of suffocation with
men . enthusiastic over- the Irish game
which is making such rapid headway,
both as a sport and a pastime.
Fitzgerald and the veteran "Cousin
Jim" Nealon were pitted against Al
Hampton and "Joe" Collins, both recog
nized as being of the champion class on
this coast. Of the five games played Fitz
gerald and Nealon won the first, fourth
cheers. The sharp exchanges pleased the
enthusiasts, who were quick to note every
move of the great quartet of players.
Fitzgerald 'expressed himself as being
somewhat hampered by the regulation re-'
quiring a player to serve to either the
right or left court instead of. any part of
the court, as is the custom in champion
ship games. . . â¢
As he said: "If you are fighting a man
who; has but one arm, -that is all you
have to watch. There Is no fear of a
blow from a second arm. So in handball
if. the service is- in one court that is all
you have to watch. . I prefer the other
style, as you keep a player on the jump
all the time. He never knows where the
next ball is coming from." . \u25a0 /
Fitzgerald wlll.be on the coast some
time and will take part In other matches.

suspicion; first given utterance last Thurs
day, investigated on Friday and proven on
Saturday, that one of the poles marking
the distances at the racetrack had been
moved on Wednesday night. This made
the pole marking three-eighths of a mile
from the timers' stand forty to forty-five
fe,et less than the supposed distance.' The
pole was in its proper place again Thurs
day night. . â¢
Had It been that only the usual work
outs were given it would have made no
greater difference than that several men
who on Thursday thought they had phe
nomenal yearlings found their mistake
later. There was, however, a gentleman
from New York, Mr. Hill, the representa
tive of Clarence Mackay, who was there
on Thursday and saw a yearling make the
short three-eighths in 36% seconds. He re
turned with an option on the colt, said to
be $$000. Trainers at the track made the
discovery as to the change in the position
of the pole. While no one Is suspected, a
popular demand for an investigation led
to the following call for a meeting on
Tuesday:
All- those interested In the breeding, training
or retiring of thoroughbred horses are request
ed to meet at the Phoenix Hotel in this city.
Tuesday noon; for the purpose of taking such
action as may be necessary to determine the
truth of reports that a pole, supposed to mark
three-efjrhtns of -a mile from the wire, on the
Kentucky Association racetrack, was moved,
and. if the reports be found correct, â¢ to take
such action as may be .necessary to expose and
punish the person or -persons guilty of mov
ing it. ...

\u25a0The Cripples seemed to have exhausted
their supply of ginger in the morning
game. They proved no "match for the
sprightly young men who serve Uncle
Henry Harris. The latter had the spec
tators on tiptoe In the third when they
rolled up four runs, lburg hit safe. Nor
dyke flew out and Wilson followed with a
two-bagger, sending lburg to third. Hilde
brand fouled -out. Schwartz secured a
pass to first, filling the bases. Pabst was
next up, and the crowd, which for once
was rooting hard for the home team
urged him to repeat his performance of
the previous day and sÂ«nd It over the
fence. He fouled the first ball over tne
fence and a nice new one was produced.
PAbst hit It safe for two bags just inside
the right field foul line. He scored lburg
and Wilson. Krug followed with a tnree
bagger, sending home Schwartz and
Pabst. Shay was hit by the pitcher.. In
attempting a double steal Krug was out
at the plate, retiring the side.
San Francisco sent its last man home
in the next inning. Josh Reilly reached
second on a hit. assisted by several heici
iag errors. He went to third on Nordyke's
hit and scored on a throw to second to
head on* Xordyke.
Kagan scorea the only run for Oakland.
He reached first on a wild throw from
Shay at shortstop and made second on
Babbitt's single, which rolled between
Krug's legs. Eagan went to third while
Catcher Wilson held the ball and watched
him. He came home on Hanson's hit.
Babbitt was caught at the plate. The
score:.
The ground was slippery under the sur
face, making the lielders uncertain of
their footing and explaining away some
of the errors.
Nagle, the amateur pitcher from Santa
Rosa, was given a severe trial by the
hard hitting batters on Uncle Henry's
busebalr team yesterday afternoon at
Recreation Park. He went through the
ordeal creditably, although showing his
lack of experience in fast company. The
spectators Indicated by their applause
that they appreciated his efforts.

Thirty Pleasure Craft Take Up Win
ter Moorings in the Quiet Water*
-\u25a0;.;.?\u25a0 ':'." Behind Tiburon.
Promptly at noon yesterday the draw
bridge at Tlburon was raised and the
yachts began at one a to pass into the
lagoon, where they will safely ride out
the 'storms of winter.. The launch C. A.
McNeill towed the first string, consisting
of the yachts Edna, Spray, Phoenicia.
Mignon and Emma. The topmast of tha
sloop Phoenicia caught against the draw
bridge and was broken, though It did not
fall down. The rest passed throug^wlth
out mishap. Then, the launch
pulled \u25a0 the sloop "Wawona and a small
craft also named Emma Into the lagoon.
Next came the launch Puss, with the
sloop Halcyon, the big and much-traveled
yawl Frolic and the sloop Xada tagging
after her. Another small launch towed
Frank Stone's cup winner Presto and the
sloop Cupid. These were followed by tha
launch Helen, towing the sloop Mist.
Charles Crocker's launch gave her tow
line to the sloops Truant and Amigo and
the launch Gazelle towed the San Fran
cisco yachts Royal, Thetis and Juanita.
The launch C. A. McNeill on her second
trip brought in- the sloops Clara. Discov
ery and May. -Next came the sloop Ram
bler, followed by the launch Puss, with
the sloops Harpoon, Freda and Aeolus.
The sloops Merope and Queen were
brought in by the launch- Crescle and the
sloop Rover by the launch C. A. McNeill.
Charles Crocker's launch took charge of
the sloop Moccasin and the launch Crescle
towed in the big sloop Mischief. After the
yachts came the arks Bat. Utopia and La
Fiesta. The towline of La Fiesta parted
but a fresh line was made fast and with
some little difficulty the unwieldy craft
which was all but as wide as the bridge
was pulled through. The launch Gipsy
brought up the rear with -Peter Lamb's
prize-winning sloop Stella. The whole af
fair occupied a little more than an hour
The tide was ebbing strongly while the
yachts entered the lagoon and three or
four hours later the water had nearly all
run out, leaving the yachts heeled over on
their sides In the soft mud. About ten or
a dozen yachts still remain in Tlburon
Cove, as well as several arks
The yawl Seven Bells is on the way3 at
Andersen's shipyard. South San Fran
cisco, and the sloop Nixie is on Swanson's
ways at Tlburon. The sloops Genesta.
Speedwell and Ceres will be taken up to
Corto Madera Creek next Saturday and
will lie there during the winter. Most of
the yachts of the San Francisco fleet have
taken up anchorage to the north of the
ferry slip of the North Pacific Coast Rail
road, where the water is shoal and the
bottom muddy. Thus ends the last chap
ter of the yachting season of 1001.

NEW HAVEN. Conn,. Oct .27.â Ugly
stories are heard of the game .between
Columbia and Â»YaIe yesterday, the Yale
students asserting that several of the
Columbia eleven were not bona-flde stu

not make a statement to that effect, but
admit an Investigation has been started.
Coach G. Foster Sanford of Columbia
while here denied absolutely that a single
man on the Columbia eleven was not a
student In good standing in that univer

Columbia's football players and the un

the insinuation made by Yale that Colum

though an hour after they made the in-,
sinuations they were retracted. The stu-A
dents against whom It Is thought suspt- J

The only apparent foundation for. the

Time of Death Was Strange.

Then, as if guided by prophecy, Curtiss
sent to his own residence and' told his
wife to go at once and tell Mrs. Sugden
what had occurred.
Thus the~message of death was borne
to the family with all of the detail that
pertained to the dream of Friday night.

Curtiss ran out and saw the prostrate
form of his friend and neighbor. . The
hand of death was. there, and before Dr.

called, could reach the scene the stricken
man breathed his last. . .
"It was the dream." shrieked the grief
stricken woman as she fell, fainting, into
the arms of Mrs. Curtiss.
It was the fact, for not half a block
from his home the aged railroad' employe
had dropped dead, stricken by heart dis
ease, while he was on his way to his
work. Some little children saw him reel,
stagger and fall to the ground. They did
not realize what had actually occurred,
that the death, so remarkably foretold,
had come. So the witnesses ran to.Police

the boÂ«Iy of George C. Boswell, a miner
from .Muska. was found in his room at
the Alaska House. Sixth and Broadway,
this morning. Boswell had not been seen
since '..'hursday night. He had come to
Oaklar.d two weeks ago from the Klon
dike, trhere he met indifferent success.
During his stay in this city Boswell went
to Dr. llehrmann. the Coroner, for treat
ment, laving an ailment which gave him
a great deal of mental distress. The phy
sician tried to ease his patient's mind,
but Be swell persisted in borrowing trou
ble, exaggerating to himself the condition.
The Coroner feels that his patient became
so despondent over his physical state that
he either ended his life or died from over
indulgence in liquor taken to drown his
thougMs.
So far as could be learned, Boswell had
no reljitlve*-h(?re, and was a total stran

Father Crowley received a copy of the

The order was the result of attacks by
Father Crowley upon fellow pastors and
charges of favoritism, fraud and cruelty
which he made at the time Father Mul
doon was consecrated as auxiliary Bishon
of the Chicago diocese. Father Crowley
was warned repeatedly to desist, but
finally Archbishop Feehan compelled him
to resign. Later Father Crowley with
drew his resignation, but it had already
been accepted by Chancellor Barry, ani
it was made absolute. Then Father Crow
ley started legal proceedings to keep his
successor out of the pastorate, and re
newed his attack on Bishop Muldoon. A
vc-ek s.go Cardinal Martinelli. the papal
delegate, came to Chicago and took fin-U
action. He gave Father Crowley a
i ho.es of two thingsâ ;o make humbie pen
iime and accept without protest a life
within the confines of a monastery or
be dismissed forever from the rights and
privileges of the Catholic church. Father
Crowley was given until Saturday night
to decide, and as nothing was heard
from fcim an order for excommunication
was sent to-day by Archbishop Feehan to
every pastor in the diocese.
CHICAGO. Oct. 27.-Father Jeremiah
Crowley, late pastor of SL Mary's
Church at Oregon. 111., has been excom
munica:cd by Archbishop Feehan of the
Chicago diocese. The edict of excom
munication forbids his being present or
assisting at any of the public exercises
or offices of religion in the Roman Catho

The facts were placed before the painter
this afternoon and he admitted to Chief
of Police Hodgkins and Detectives Shorey
and Kyte that be had been toying with the
truth. ; \u25a0
When he recovered himself, Knight ex
plained, he did not have time to report the
robbery at the police office, but waited
until this morning.
Ail this with a careful description of
the robbers was supplied the police, who
then went at once to work on the affair.
First they discovered that Knight - had
not been home all night. Then they traced
him to a downtown saloon, then to the
green baize-covered table with a slot in it,
where Knight and a company o* boon
companions .were playing poker at the
very hour he had said he was the victim
of the trio of desperadoes.
To cover the loss of his money at the
gambling: table. M. M. Knight, a contract
ing painter, residing at 1940 Linden street,
told the police to-day a wild story of as
sault and robbery, which on its face led
the detectives to make investigation. The
result of the police inquiry was to force
Knight to confess he had lost the money.
5<5, at poker last night, a portion of the
coin belonging to A. H. Jones, his partner.
As narrated by the contractor,* he was
going home last night about 7:30 o'clock,
when he was assailed by three men at the
corner of West and Eighteenth streets.
The trio of highwaymen, who the police
discovered were phantoms, did a regula
tion job. One of them, said Knight, struck
him with a blunt weapon, knocked him
down and almost senseless, then tne two
other footpads rifled his pockets.

Men's building. The memorial service,
simple yet solemn and impressive, was
similar to that which was celebrated yes-Â»
terday. in all the great reservations of
the United States by the different tribes
of the Red Men. Representatives from all
the local tribes were present. The in
terior of Assembly Hall was appropriately
decked in mourning.
The service, besides â¢ being commemora
tive of all the brethren. who passed away
during the year, was in. particular a me
morial to William McKinley, the great
chief of the Ohio reservation. In his eulo
gy, Emillo Lastreto, grand sannap, paid a
touching tribute to the sterling virtues of
our martyred President. He described
how McKinley rose by his own merits
from soldier to lawyer, to statesman, and
how he was chosen Governor by the peo
ple of his State, and lastly how he was
elected by the people of the whole United
States to. the Presidency. He recalled the
pathetic scene which marked the close of
the great statesman's life, and declared
that the. implicit faith "which McKinley
professed in . God was the same as' ani
mated the Red Men of the Forest.
In the first part of his eulogy, Grand
Sannap Lastreto spoke, of the various
ceremonies of respect and veneration
which the people of various nations of
the past were accustomed to pay to their
dear departed. In this connection he told
of the imperishable pyramids which the
Egyptian kings erected in order to per
petuate their memory.
The order of exercises was as follows:

Mrs. General George- W. Dietzlor died
yesterday morning at her home. 3309 Clay
street. She was the widow of General
Dietzler. who died in this city in 1884,
and whose funeral was largely attended
by representatives of .the Grand Army,
Loyal Legion and Knights Templar. In the
civil war he rendered distinguished ser
vice. His leadership of the Kansas troops
at the battle of Wilson's Creek was
heroic. His widow, who passed away yes
terday, was born in Virginia, Her maiden
name was Anna M. Neill. The family
moved to Missouri when she was a child.
She and \u25a0General Dietzler were married
at Lexington; Mo., in 1S65. They lived. at
Lawrence, Kan., until 1873, when they
came to California. The survivors of the
family are two daughtersâ Miss Mamie
Dietzler and Mrs. George W. Toohy. The
funeral. will take place at 10:30 a. m. to
morrow from the family home.
Death of Mrs. General Dietzler.
The supposed husband of - the woman
did not learn of the mishap until he found
a young man bringing his horse and cart
toward the Seal Rock House. Jumping
into the cart he whipped up his steed and
started ' in . pursuit of the well-meaning
citizen who was trying to aid the injured
woman. His horse was not very speedy,
so it is not yet known how or where the
incident terminated.
The woman is described as being be
tween 25 and 30 years of age, while her
supposed husband was apparently several
years her senior.
The woman in her efforts to seize the
reins fell to the ground. In falling-, how
ever, she managed to grasp the axle. She
held on with desperation and was drag
ged over the rough road until she re
leased her hold and fell unconscious to
the ground. . . . . â¢\u25a0 \u25a0 '.
A driver of a horse and buggy, seeing
her plight and' evidently thinking .the
woman had been driving alone, jumped
out of his buggy and seizing the pros
trate woman lifted her into his vehicle.
He then', started his horse at breakneck
speed down the hill, holding the uncon
scious woman in his buggy with one arm.
He raced his horse off in the direction of
the road leading into the park, with the
evident intention of carrying the unfor
tunate woman to some hospital or drug
store. ' . \u25a0
There was a startling scene enacted
yesterday afternoon at the ocean beach,
which was witnessed by many people..
A woman whose name could not be
learned was riding with a man supposed
to be her husband in a cart drawn by a
big- black steed. In front of the Seal Rock
House the man alighted and entered the
resort to secure refreshments. Suddenly
the horse started on a wild run up the
steep road to the Cliff House. ..

with -Judge Noyes, posing and drawing
down a salary as the Judge's private sec
retary and stenographer. â¢ It became a
notorious fact soon after Wheeler reached
Nome that he could not write a word oi
shorthand, and to those who touched on
this point he intimated that it was a
shield to protect him "while he practiced
law. in the Judge's chambers, and repre
sented that he was Judge Noyes' broker.
In this position Wheeler proved more
than once that he could get the Judge to
sign "any old order," the notorious deep
sea orders being a few of the reliefs
which he got from the Judge.
When Judge Noyes departed from

R. N. Stevens, one of McKenzie's chief
lieutenants In North Dakota politics, was
appointed Commissioner of the Nome dis
trict, and although he is said to have
left Dakota broke he succeeded after a
brief period as Commissioner and Recorder
of the Nome district in amassing money
Forced Incorporation for Spite.
In Alaska a United States Commission
er enjoys the combined powers of a
Police Judge, Justice of the Peace and
Recorder. Without the collusion of the
Commissioners wholesale corruption and
â¢â¢graft" would be almost impossible in the
higher court, over which Judge Noyes
presided. When McKenzie and his satel
lites set foct on the shore at Nome Judge
Noyes evinced great care in the selec
tion of the United States Commissioners
for that place and its adjacent districts.
Every one of the important commissioner
ships were settled upon men who were
friends of the ringleaders in the alleged
conspiracy to loot the mines of Nome, the
details of which are now being threshed 1
out in the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals.
In aadition to this the telegram, which
came via Seattle, and which was re
ceived by one of the attorneys of the Pio
r.ecr Mining Company, stated that the
Grand Jury was investigating the corrup
tion existing in the lower judiciary of the
Second Division of Alaska, and that it is
o,uite likely that Galen." Wheeler, Stevens
and Cochrane will be indicted upon
charges of blackmail, bribery and perhaps
embezzlement of Government funds.

from that section brought the informa

O. D. Cochrane, aJl of whom were looked
tpon as creatures of Alexander McKen
zie and Judge Arthur H. Noyes.

When questioned, the night watchman
vowed that none of the Chinese had
escaped. .. ,
"I caught one man coming down the
water spout," said he, "and took him
by the queue back to the corral. I then
made an investigation and heard some
v/agons driving away. I suspected a plot
and at once placed a man on the look
cut. I thought I had got the ! first run
away, but if the inspectors say five are
missing, then they got away before I
made my rounds."
The steamship compbnies will now have
to reckon with Uncle Sam over the five
unless the Chinese Six Companies pay it
and hush the whole matter up. At pres
ent "the Mail Dock is an-easy place to
escape from.
A big- plot to release the 150 Chinese
In the Mail Dock corral was frustrated
early yesterday morning. As it was, five
of the coolie prisoners got away, while
another was caught in the act. â¢
- The matter had .evidently ' been care
fully considered in and engineered from
Chinatown. A hole had been made in
the roof near the eaves. Alongside the
hole was an escape pipe for the water
that falls during rains. This, pipe ends
near the Brahnan street sewer, and once
the Chinese got that far, escape was
easy. Half a dozen hacks were in wait-
Ing- among the lumber piles, and as soon
as a man. made the journey down the
water pipe, he, was gathered in and
hustled away to Chinatown.
Almost every steamship that has ar
rived from the Orient during the last
month has brought a crowd of Chinese
for this port; Most of them land as "Na
tive Sons" and merchants, others as trav
elers and students, while ' the rest
are held as having -no right to enter the
United States. These latter have been in
creasing in number until Saturday night
there were more than 150 of them, in the
corral. These were all held at the expense
of the Pacific Mail, Occidental and Ori
ental and Toyo Kisen Kaisha companies.
If any one of them escaped the company
that brought them here was liable to
Uncle Sam under its bond.
Saturday afternoon the Chinese were
all counted by the Customs authorities.
Yesterday morning the count was made
again and five were missing. Then there
was an inquiry and the watchman was
called 'in. A close insDection of the prem
ises showed where the "Heathen Chinee"
had cut the hole, the cgver to which,
when put in place, fitted like a die. The
toe marks on the side of the building
showed how the escapes had slid down
the wall to the wharf below.
"When Stevens went to Nome he left a
very unsavory reputation behind him in
the States. While living in MenoH
County. Illinois, in 1877. Eli Reep oÂ£
Petersburg. In the .same county, went
Into bankruptcy, and Stevens was ap
pointed assignee. Fearing that there had
been some juggling with the funds, thÂ»
creditors sued tor an accounting. Stevens
said he had received only 5111 15. but 5*
was shown thst he had received $495 In
addition, which he disclaimed all knowl
edge of. The matter was brought before
the Grand Jury, but United States Attor
ney Van Hoobeck. a friend of p. Mr. Mi-
Meeley, Stevens' chief counsel, had the
matter quashed. Subsequently Stevens
went to North Dakota, where he was
mixed up in many legislative and other
scandals. He has a reputation for wrong
enough to become quite a factor in min
ing aeals requiring me investment of Â«con
s:uerablÂ« money ana incidentally a little
official protection.
At the election to decide whether or not
the town oi Nome should be incorporated
Judge Stevens used his office as a club
to compel the gambling and saloon ele
ment to vote for tne measure oy threat
ening m a. public speech to close every
salogn and gambling house in tne town
if incorporation did not carry. This bold
declaration was made in the face of the
tact that there was a statute in the Alas
ka code which provided that gambling of
any kind was umawtul ana punishable by
heavy fines and imprisonment. At the
time Judge Stevens made tnis declaration
tne. Nome newspapers charged that he
was actuated by spite because the gam
blers and business men owning large
stores refused to contribute to a corrup
tion fund of $30u0 said to have been de
manded by District Attorney Wood, which
the latter claimed he wouia use to defeat
incorporation.
Stevens had the reputation in Nome' of
being the shrewdest manipulator of the
McKenzie-Noyes crowd. During the trial
of the famous Ring-Yager case for the
possession of claim 7, on Gold Run. Ste
vens, who was acting as attorney fo.*
Jumper King-, was caught in a pretty
trap. He induced Yager to sell his in
terest in the mine for $5000 and agree to
leave the country, thus leaving his at
torneys, who had taken the case on tt
contingent fee, in a sorry plight. Stevens
paid 1'ager the money while the case wai
being tried, but while attempting to leave
the country yager was arrested by his
own attorneys and made to go upon th3
witness stand, vindicate his own location
and tell the story â¢ of Stevens' shady
transaction. On the witness stand In
Judge Noyes 1 court Stevens attempted to
justify his action by saying: "I find It
necessary under the present administra
tion of justice to be on both sides of the
case in order to get to work a piece Of
ground in this country." Noyes, evi
dently, was so much in Stevens' power
that "he did not take cognizance of th^
Insult which Stevens" shameless admis
sion offered. Shortly afterward, how
ever, Stevens and Noyes quarreled about
the division 'of some mining property, so
it is said, and then came the passing of
Stevens.

If Felts' elegant stock has been sold to the Walk-over |j

i Felts', needed the space for their new line of ladies' II
H Walk-overs and to meet the urgent demand for more fj
05 room made necessary by their growing business. fl 1
7T ( Every lady in San Francisco who - appreciates ele- 1
J gance in footwear knows Felts.' She knows. that. less 11
fi than a year ago Felts' was inaugurated on lines that II
fl for sumptuousness of appointment . and elegance of v
II contents was conceded to be immeasurably beyond &ft
11 anything in this line ever before seen in San Francisco, iy
Ij or, for that matter, in any other American city. \|
U. Every pair of shoes in the Felts stock is the very H
1' finest that skill and care can devise for the price 1
i charged and reflects its grace and elegance in every J
J line. That many of these shoes sold for $6 to $io a ||
j pair gives some idea of their excellence and splendid II
!f worth. That the Walk-over management intends "to .1 1-
dispose of this stock at once is evident from the fact Â§
that these $6, $7, $8. and $10 shoes, will all be. sold i'
The sale will begin next Wednesday morning at 9 I I
