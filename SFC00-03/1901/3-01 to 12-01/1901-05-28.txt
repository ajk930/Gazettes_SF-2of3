view of- the formation of the Government
and the constitution provision ' requiring
that "duties,' imposts and excises shall bo
uniform throughout .the United States,','
saying that' '/it is explained by subsequent
provisions of the constitution that 'no tax

bo given by ' any regulation of commerce
or revenue to the ports of one State o-.cr
those of another.7 nor shall .vessels bound

The Circuit Court of the United States
for the Southern District of New York,
sustained /^he^ Government In ? this posi
tion in imposing' n duty.
The Supreme Court aiflrmed the opinion
of the Circuit .Court, saying:.
"Wo are of the opinion that the Island
of Porto Rico Is a territory. appurtenant,
and belonging to the United States, but
not a part of 'the : United States within
the. revenue' clause' of the constitution;
that the Foraker act Is constitutional so
far as It Imposes Â¦ duties upon Imports
from such Islands and,' that the plaintiff
cannot recover back the duties exacted
In ; the case."
Tho opinion of the; court went, into the
case very fully. Justlco Brown early In
his opinion outlined the distinction be
tween this case, and the De Lima case,
which had juat been decided, saying:
"In the case of De Lima versus > Bid
well,, wo hold that upon the ratification
of the treaty of pcace*wlth Spain,' Porto
Rico coased to .be a foreign , country and
that duties were, no longer collectable
upon , merchandise , brought from . that
Island. 'Â¦ We are now asked to hold that
It became ' a part . of , the United ; States
within . that \ provision of the constitution
which declares that 'all i duties, imposts
and excises shall be uniform throughout
the United States.' If Porto Rico be ',a
part of /the United* States, the Foraker
act. Imposing duties upon its products
is unconstitutional, not only by reason of
a violation of the. uniformity clause, but
because by section' 9/ .'vessels bound -to
or -from one State,' cannot 'be obliged to
enter,". clear or pay duties in another.'
Not Answered by Constitution.
"The -case- also involves the broader
question whether Â¦ the revenue clauses of
the - constitution ; extend : of ,' their. â¢. own
force to | our newly acquired Territories.
The constitution itself doos . not ; answer
the question. -'Its' solution' must* be found
In ' the # * naturo fof . the | government 'I created

"contemporaries '/.".in ; . the -K' practical ," con
struction . put ; upon it by7 Congress and ; In
the decisions of this court." ;' " ,
before the opening of the civil war, that
the Chief Justice had felt Impelled to dis
cuss the question upon Its merit*.
"It is," he said, "sufficient to say that
tho country did not acquiesce in the opin
ion and that the civil war which ahortlv
thereafter, followed 'produced such
changes In Judicial as well as public sen
timent as to seriously Impair the author
ity of the casÂ«." , . â¢
He added: "The power to prohibit
slavery in the Territories is so different
from the power to imnoso duties upon
Territorial .products and depends upon
such 'different provisions of the constitu
tion that they can; scarcely be considered
as analogous: unless: we assume broadly
that every clause of the constitution at
tachecTto the Territories as well as lo the
States,' a claim quite Inconsistent with the
position of the court in the Canter, case.
The difficulty with the Dred Scott case
was that the court refused to make 'a dis
tinction between property in general . nnd
a wholly, exceptional class of property."
Taking up the'ease in. hand the Justice
continued hi* opinion, stfylng:
Organization of Territories.
,"The practical interpretation put by
Congress upon the constitution has, been
long continued and uniform to the effect
that the constitution is applicable to ter
ritories acquired by purchase or conquest
only when and so , far as Congress < shall
so direct. Notwithstanding its duty to
â¢guarantee to every State lir this Union a
republican form of government,' 'Congress
did not hesitate In the original organiza

WASHINGTON. Msy 27,-In the
United BtfttM Supreme Court
to-day opinions wero handed
down In all but two easts be
foro that court Involving thÂ«
relations of the United States to lti In
ruler possessions. The two cases in which
no conclusion was anounced were thote
known as the fourteen diamond rings
i fine and the aocond of the Dooley cases.
'i tm undecided Dooley case deals with a
}ihnÂ«e of the Porto Rican question, and
the diamond rings case involves the right
tn the free transportation of merchandise
from the Philippines to the United States.
The original intention of the court had
been to adjourn after to-day's pitting for
the term, but discussion of the cases
paBsed on to-day took about live hours,
ro the court adjourned until to-morrow,
when it Is presumed the remaining cases
will be passed upon.
Of the several cases decided to-day the
two which atracted the greatest share of
attention from the court were what is
known as the De Lima case and that
known as the Downes caw. and of these
two the opinion in the Downes case is
considered the most far-reaching, as It af
fects our future relations, whereas the
De Lima case dealt with a transitional
phase of our insular relations.
The De Lima case was the first to re
ceive the attention of the court, and as it
appeared to be quite swecplngly opposed
to the Government's contentions many
persons precipitately, arrived at the con
clusion that the Government had been
worsted all along the line. iThis view
Euffered a decided change when the con
clusion was announced in the Downes
case. The court was very evenly divided
on both caEes, but political lines were
not at all controlling.
Duty Must Be Returned.
The De Lima case involved the power
of the Government to collect a duty on
goods Imported into the United States
from Porto Rico after the ratification of
the treaty of Paris and before the passage
of the Porto Rican act. The court said
the Government's contention In this case
was substantially a claim that Porto Rico
Is foreign territory. The entire case turned
upon that contention. The court held that
the position was not well takenâ that Por
to Rico was not at the time foreign ter
ritory, and that therefore the duty which
had been collected must be returned.
The decision In the Downes case fol
lowed the history of the dealings of the
United States with Porto Rico, a step fur
ther. That case dealt with the legality
of the exaction of duties on goods im
ported from Porto Rico into New York
after the paeeage of the Foraker act pro
viding for a duty upon goods shipped from
Porto Rico to the United States. In this
caee the court held that such exaction
was legal and constitutional.
The point of the two opinions con
sidered collectively Is that Fort)
Ulco was never after the acquisition
of that island foreign territory; that
until Congress acted upon tho ques
tion no duty could be collected, but
lhat as soon as Congress outlined a
method of controlling the island's rev
enues that action became binding â in
other words, that Congress has power
under the constitution to prescribe
the manner of collecting the revenues
rf the country's insular possessions,
Chlef Justice and Justice Harlan present
ed their views in written form. Justices
Gray, Shlras, White and McKenna also,
while agreeing with the conclusion an
nounced by. Justice Brown, announced
that they had reached the conclusion by
different lines of argument, and Justices
i. This" case involved the question wheth
er merchandise brought Into the port of
New York from Porto. Rico .since the
p'assage of: the Foraker act is exempt
from duty, notwithstanding the .third
section of that act, " : which- requires the
payment , of "fifteen per cent : of the du-
end has the right to lay a duty on
goods Imported into our insular poi â¢
sessions from the United States or
exported from them Into the United
States. It holds, in brief, that for tax
ation purposes they are not a part of
the United States to the extent that
goods shipped between their ports
and the United States are entitled to
the same treatment as though they
were shipped between New York and
New Orleans .
Justice Brown delivered 'the court's
opinion In both cases, and there were vig
orous dissenting opinions In both. In the
Downes case four of the nine members of
the court united in en opinion crltcizlug

Shiran and MeKnmia united, concurring
in th# decree affirming the Judgment of
the Downes case, but placing it on
ground* which hÂ« laid were not only dif
ferent from but In conflict with those ex
prensed by Justice Brown. The question
At lsiue In this case, he said, was whether
tho provision of the constitution giving
Congress power to lay duties, Imposts and
excises, but requiring that they should be
uniform' "throughout the United States,"
had been violated by the Foraker act Im
posing duties on poods corning: from Porto
Rico Into the United States. The propo
sitions, elaborately argued at the trial,
that the Government of the United States,
being created; by the constitution, that
instrument, where It limits the power of
the Government, does so everywhere,
wherever it3 authority is exerted, were
conceded. Thero never could txÂ» any seri
ous question that when the Government
3 of the United States exorcises an authority
" winch ' the"* constitution confers the appli
cable limitations of the constitution con
trol It. While this was true universally
In evÂ«sry case, tho question was not
whether the constitution followed the flag,
but, granting that It did so. what provi
sion wns applicable to particular cases.
The cruses which it waÂ» said werÂ© an ex
ception were certain general limitations In
the constitution' In favor of liberty and
property which withdraw all power from
Congress. Such limitations were every
where applicable, and of course could
never be transgressed. In view of this,
the opinion went on; "there Is reason
then to contend In this case that Congress
can destroy the liberties of the people of
Porto Rico by exercising In their regard 1
- powers against freedom and Justice which
the constitution has absolutely denied."
The sole and only issue is, Has
Porto Elco, at the timo of passage of
the act in question, been incorporated
into and become an integral part of
the United States P )'.â¢?;
' Considering this question. Justice Whits
affirmed that the rule of international law
was that the relation which an acquired
country would bear to the acquiring coun
try in the absence of treaty stipulations
was to be determined by that country con
formably to Its institutions. The"Unlted
States possessed the same powers on this
subject a.<i any qther nation.
Right to Acquire Territory.
.Justice White then went exhaustively
into the history of the United States and
of Its acquired territories,' and In support
of his assertion that our history from the
beginning had manifested that this power
was possessed by the United States. Ah
acknowledgment of our right to acquire
territory, coupled with a contention that
when acquired the territory was abso
lutely and unconditionally Incorporated
Into the United States, he sold, was to ad
mit the power to acquire and Immediately
to deny Its beneficial existence To hold
that the treaty-majclng power cannot in
sert conditions In acquiring would deprive
that power of a necessary attribute and
would confer upon It tho authority to de
stroy/the; Government of the United
States. If millions of Inhabitants of alien
.territory, if acquired by treaty, can. with
out the desire or consent of the people of
the United States, speaking through Con
cms, bo Immediately and Irrevocably in-'
corporate^ Into the United States, the
whole structure of tbo Government can
be overthrown. While thus aggrandizing
the treaty-making power on the one haml,
tho constitution at the same time min
imizes. It on the other, in that it strips
that autherlty of any right to acquire ter
rltoy upon any condition which would
guard the people of the United States
frcm< the evil of Immediate Incorporation.
What also becomes of the popular branch
of Congress, which, though it might be
unwilling to agree to the Incorporation of
alien races, would be Impotent to prevent
Its accomplishment?

HEANS FREE IMPORTATION
OF ARCHIPELAGO'S PRODUCTS
Now That the Barrier Is Thrown Down It Is Expected There
Will Be an Immediate Increase in Importations From Isl
ands, and ; Sugars, Tobaccos and Herrip Be Hurried Here
S0C&AL.L. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
if W.. WASHINGTON. May 27.â An
(I . extra session of Congress is pos-
elble as a result of the decisions
of the Supreme Court to-day in the
Insular cases, though lt Is not considered
probable by Senators and Representatives
who are now here.
The effect of tho {decision* is to open up
the ports of the United States to the free
importation of all products of the Philip
pines until such time as Congress shall
enact a law prescribing the duties to bo
assessed. Up to this time full Dlngley
duties have been collected on all Imports
from the Philippines. Now that that bar
rier has been thrown down it Is expected^
that there will be an Immediate increase
ln importations from the inlands. Philip
pine sugars, tobaccos, hemp and all other
goods produced in tho islands will be
hurried across the Pacific as fast as pos
sible, with a view to getting them inside
the tariff barrier before Congress can put
the bars up again. V
The effect of this will be not only to
bring goods of the Philippines into direct
competition with similar goods produced
In the United States, which is contrary to
the policy of protection, but lt will result
In an appreciable reduction ln the reve
nues of the Government as well.
The general Impression here to-night Is
that the conditions will not be so serious
as to warrant tho calling of an extra scs
nicn.
Secretary of the Treasury Gage said ho
did* not think It would be necessary to
call Congress together. Senator Lodge
also said he did not think an extra session
would be necessary. Â¦ It may bo possible
to accomplish nearly the same effec,t from
a protective point of view 'by the Imposi
tion of an export duty on goods leaving
the Philippines equivalent to the Dlngley
duties. '.V -
Money to Be Refunded.
It Is Impossible to form even an approx
imate estimate of the amount of money
that the, Government will' have to' refund
to Importers under to-day'a decisions of
the court.
"I cannot talk with any certainty about
the amount of money to be ' refunded,"
paid Assistant. Secretary of the Treasury
fipauldlng to-night. "It Is impossible to
even estimate the amount vt money that
will be paid back. To get these figures lt
would be nccessury to communicate with
the various custpm-houscs, ns tho de
partment records do not show payments
of duties that have been protested. As I
understand, the Government can continue
to collect duties from Porto Rico under
the Foraker act, but lt cannot collect
from, the Philippines In the absence of
legislation. The department has a con
tinuing appropriation which will permit
the refunding of duties improperly col
lected undeÂ»r the DLhgley act where pro
tcBt has been made. ' Unless a protest was
mado at the time of payment the Govern
ment will not have to* refund. Tho whole
thing is up in the air now, and I do not
know how the situation Btands. If any
steps are to be taken to close the open
door to tho Philippines lt Is for the Presi
dent to act,"

Including stamps, licenses, excises and all
the paraphernalia of that system, and
applying It to territories which have hu.l
no experience of this kind, and where it
would prove an Intolerable burden."
Commenting upon the virtual absence of
provision ln the constitution for the ac
quisition of territory. Justloe Brown say*
It can only be accounted for on the ground
that the framers of that Instrument did
not foresee the country's future possibili
ties ln that respect.
"If," he says, "lt be once conceded that
we are at liberty to acquire foreign terri
tory, a presumption arises that our power
with respect to such territory Is the same
power which other nations have been ac
customed to exercise with respect to ter
ritories acquired by them. If, In limiting
the power .which Congress was to exer
cise within the United States, lt was also
Intended to limit lt with recard to sucn
territories as the people of the United
States should thereafter acquire, such lim
itations should have been expressed. In
stead of that we find the constitution
speaking only to States, except In the ter
ritorial clause which Is absolute ln Its
terms and suggestive of no* limitations
upon the power of Congress In dealing
with them. The States could only dele
gate to Congress such power as they
themselves possessed and as they had no
power to acquire new territory they had
none to delegate ln that connection. The
logical Inference from, this is that If Con
gress had power to acquire new territory,
which Is conceded, that power was not
hampered by the constitutional pro
visions."
In the last paragraph of his opinion, be
fore announcing the court's opinion, Jus
tice Brown said:
"Patriotic and Intelligent men may dif
fer widely as to the desirableness of this
or that acquisition, but this is solely a po
litical question. We can only consider this
aspect of the case so far as to say that
no construction of the constitution should
bo adopted which would prevent Congress
from considering each case upon Its
merits, unless the language of tha Instru
ment Imperatively demands It. A false
step at this time might be fatal to the de
velopment of what Chief Justice Marshall
called the American empire. Choice In
some cases, the natural . gravitation of
small bodies toward largo ones In others,
the result of a successful war in still
others, may bring about conditions which
would render the- annexation of distant
possessions desirable. If those possessions
are Inhabited by alien races, differing
from us In religion, customs, laws, meth
ods of taxation and modes of thought, the
administration of government and Justice,
according to Anglo-Saxon principles, may
for a time be Impossible, and the question
at once arises whether large concession*
ought not to be made for a time that, ul
timately, our own theories may be carried
out and the blessings of a free govern
ment under the constitution extended to
them. We decline to hold that there l*
anything in the, constitution to forbid
such action."

IN THE DE LIMA CASE
A .< - ; *â â ' m -
Differs From the Easy Definition of the Majority of the
Highest Tribunalon the Question* as to Whether Porto

W-ASHINGTON. May SV-Jus

case, stating that Justices
, Shlraa and White Joined In
his views. The majority, he said, pro
ceeded on, tho simple proposition that to
settle whether Porto Rico is "foreign
country" or domestic territory is to settle
the controversy, in "litigation In the par
ticular case. But In his views lt could not
turn on so easy a definition. Between the
extremes thero wero other relations which
Porto Rico might sustain to the United
States," and It could bo 'determined that
Porto Rico occupied one "of these other
relations and Its products, hence were sub

Tho' history of our country, said Jus

quisition of foreign territoryâ examples of
what relationship territory bears to the
United Stateu authorities, executive, .leg
islative and Judicialâ as to what was wise
in statesmanship as well as what was
legal and constitutional In withholding or
extending our laws to such territory: and,

cchjUI not bo enlarged or restricted by tha
advanco or retreat of armies, and that
whether duties should b* levied wan de
pendent on Congress - granting authority,
should be accepted as wise and consid
erate of ths different functions of the ex
ecutive, legislative and Judicial depart
ments, and of their Independence. Why
should they then be discarded aa dicta?
Justice McKenna called attention to
the fact that after California's an
nexation our - customs laws had been
extended . over It, and asked why
was this necessary If they applied of their
own force. He also controverted other
historical precedents cited by the major
ity and then attacked tha majority for
asserting that without precedent it
would be Irresistibly impelled to the con
clusion that by accession of territory that
territory automatically becamo a part of
tho United States. A treaty, ho said, could
not have nn automatic force contrary to
Its terms or greater than them. Whether
Porto Rico was a foreign country within
the meaning of the revenue laws depend
ed on the treaty.
Justice Gray announced that he like
wise dissented from the majority opinion,
saying briefly that Its Judgment appeared
to him Irreconcilable with the unanimous
opinion of this court in Fleming vs. Page

the Justices ln the case to-day decidod of

lllzed, are such and entitled to all the
rights, privileges and Immunities of cit
izens. .If such be their status, the conse
quence will be extremely serious. Indeed,
lt Is doubtful if Congress would ever as
Â¦ent to the annexation of territory upon
the condition that its inhabitants, how
ever foreign they may be to our habits,
traditions and modes of life, shall become
at once citizens of the United States, ln
all Its treaties hitherto the treaty-making
power has made special provision for this
subject. ,
- "Orave apprehensions of danger are felt
by many eminent menâ a fear lest an un
restrained possession of power on the part
of Congress may lead to unjust and op
pressive legislation, ln which the natural
rights of territories, or their Inhabitants,
may be engulfed in a centralized despot-
Ism. These fears, however, find no Justi
fication ln the action of Congress In the
past century, nor ln the conduct of the
British Parliament toward its outlying
possessions since the American revolu
tion." â¢ . Â¦-Â¦'
Further along Justice Brown remarked:
"Whatever may be finally decided by the
American people as to the status of these
Islands and their* ' Inhabitantsâ whether
they shall be Introduced Into the sister
hood of State* or be permitted to form
Independent governmentsâ lt does not fol
low that ln the meantime, awaiting that
decision, the people are in the matter of
personal rights unprotected by the provi
sions of our constitution aud subject to
the merely arbitrary control of Congress.
Even If regarded as aliens they are en
titled under the principles of the constitu
tion to be protected. in .life, liberty and
property. ',
"Jjarge powers must 'necessarily be
entrusted Â¦ to Congress j in dealing
with these problems and we are
bound to assume that they will . ba
judiciously, exercised. That these
powers may be abused is possible.
But the same may be said of its pow
ers under the constitution as well as
cut side of it. Human wisdom has
never devised a form of government
so perfect that it may not be pervert
rd to bad purposes. It is never con
clusive to argue a gainst, the posses
sion of certain powers from possible
abuse a of them.
"It is safe to say that If Congress should
venture upon Â¦ legislation manifestly
dictated by selfish interests, it would re
ceive quick rebuke at the hands of the
people. Indeed, It Is scarcely possible
that Congress could do a greater Injus
tice to these bland* than would be In
volved ln holding that it could not Impose
upon the States taxes and excises with
out extending the same taxes to them.
Such requirements would bring them at
onca within our Internal revenue system.

THROUGH a ' committee which
came out from Wisconsin for
the purpose the battleship Wis
consin was presented with a sil
ver-service for her wardroom
and a plate of bronae for her
pilot house yesterday. The cere-,
mony of presentation took, j)lace on her
forward deck in the presence of her offi
cers and crew and |two score of visitors
vho accompnnied the committee from
Wisconsin out to the warship.
.The silver service consisted of punch
bowls of ample proportions and the ac
companying ladles and cups and trays,
ull beautifully ongraved and all bearing
tbu distinctive kIkii of the State of Wis
consin, the badger. The lithe little ani
mal is fac-slmlled on handles and
stands, on the cups and on the trays and
wherever he can conveniently be put. and,
like tho bear of California, he makes a
most picturesque decoration. Tbe silver.
Is all engraved with the legend, '.'From
the People of Wisconsin, by Unanimous
Vote of the Legislature of 1899."
. The silver service, however, was not the
only nor the most important. presentation.
Tlxre was also the plate of bronze bear
ing the eve# alert badger for the front of
the pilot house, and this, too was ;en-
Kravud with a legend reading "Presentea
by the People of Wisconsin," and with
thin explanatory note:' "Cast from bronze
recovered from tho wrecks of the -Spanish
crultfers destroyed by the United Btntcs
(Wet near Santiago, Cuba, "July 3, 1S0S." .
The plate stands out in bold relief from
the pilot house. It consists "of a shield
bearing the arms of the State of WlBCon
*ln> the plow, emblematic of agriculture,
and tbe anchor, emblematic of commerce,
nnd surrounded ' by a wreath of laurel.

In presenting tho plate and the silver
service Mr. Bleyer spoke briefly of the
interest which is taken ln the vessel by
the people of the State after which shb
Is named, and he expressed the hope that
tho watchword of the State would be an
encouragement to the ship iln her craeer
on the sea*. As he commenced speaking
a flag that hung from the pilot houBe and
waf. draped'-over the plate was pulled
aside, disclosing the shield and -badger.
In replying. Captain Relter commented
on the growing popularity and efficiency
of tho navy and upon the Increasing In
tctcst which Is being taken ln tho vowels.
ThlH he attributed to tho practice of nom-
Inir the vessels nfter the large cities and
tlm States of tho Union. A few years ago,
he enld, the navy of the United States was
known In only a few of its towns, and
these. only along the sea coast, â¢ but now
Its fame had spread through the country
until every village and hamlet knew of Its
shins and its deed*, and gloried In 'them.'

This ended the ceremonies, and then the
Ruostfl wore escorted aft to the cabin and
the wardroom, whero they were enter
tained In naval style and with naval fare.
ho . that concessions might well Â¦ be made
for a time, that ultimately our own
theories might bo carried out. But,
Harlan dissented from -any such theory
of our governmental system, Ho Hii'd:
* .Tho "expanding future of our country,"
Justifying' the belief that' the â¢ United
States is to become what Is called â¢ a
"world power," of which sp much, was
heard In the, argument, does not Justify
any such jugglinff with. the words of the
constitution as would ' authorize the
courts to hold that the words "throuKh
out the United States" In the taxing
clause of 'the conotltutlon do "not em
brace a '/territory of tho United States."
In conclusion, Justice Ilarlan said:
-The addition of Porto Rico 'to the territory of
the United Btates hns been recognised by direct
action- upon tin" purl of Cnngreiii. It hai log.
dinted In recognition of tha treaty with K|uilii.

the territory west of the Missouri, Is not less
within the United States than Maryland or
Pennsylvania; and It Is not less necessary,
on the principles of our constitution, that'uni
formity ln the imposition of Imposts, duties
and excises should be observed In the one than'
In the other. Since, then, the power to lay
and collect taxes, which includes direct taxei*.
Is obviously co-cxtenslve with the power to
lay and collect duties, Imposts and excises,
and since tho latter extends throughout the
United States, lt follows that the power to
impede direct taxes also extends thnaighout
the United States."
Of the suggestion that this statement
was mere dicta Chief 'Justice Fuller bald:
It Is wholly Inadmissible to reject the pro
cess of reasoning by which the Chief Justice
rc-ached and tested the soundness of his con
clusion aa merely obiter. . â¢ â¢/.â¢â¢ .
The Chief Justice held the Territories as
w <- cl i? 8 l ,!? e . DI .. 8t Â£ lct of Columbia to bo pun
of the United States for the purpose of
national taxation and repeated ln eKect
what he had already said In AlcCulloutrh
vs. Maryland, 5 Wheaton, 408: "Through
out this vast reDUbllc, from tho St. Cioix
to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, revenue Is to be collected
nnd expended, armies are to be marched
and supported." Continuing, ho combat
ted the contention that these particular
duties are local. ln their nature and bald
the levy is clearly a regulation of com
merce and' made in the exercise of*'na- !
tlonal power. He added: Â¦ ,'
In any point of view the imposition of duties
on commerce operates to regulate commerce,
and is not a matter of local- legislation, and
It follows that the levy of these duties was
In the exercise of the national power to do so.
and subject to tho requirement of geograph
ical uniformity. 7 â¢
The fact that the proceeds of these duties
are devoted by the act to the use of the Ter
ritory dooB not make national taxes local.
Nobody disputes the power of Congress to
lay and collect duties geographically uniform
and apply the proceeds, by a proper approprl*
atlon act. to the relief of a particular terri
tory, but the destination of ' the I proceeds
would not change the source of the power to
lay and collect. And that suggestion certainly
is not strengthened when based ' on the diver
sion of duties collected from all p*ts of the
United States to a territorial treaslry before
reaching the Treasury of the Unite* States.
Clause 7 of section 9 of article J. provides that
"No money shall be drawn* from the Treas
ury but ln consequence of appropriations made
by law." and the proposition that this may
be rendered inapplicable if the money is not
permitted to be paid in so as to be sURceptlble
of being drawn out Is som#)vhat startling.
The proposition that Chief Justice Mar
shall bad erred in his opinion- and that tne
rule of uniformity was a limitation to try*
States aa such was declared to b*Â» wholly
unwarranted and quite a number of cane*
were cited In which the Suprome Court
and Congress, notably by the thirteenth
and fifteenth amendments to tho constitu
tion, had sustained the view that the
United States meant Territories as well
as States.
No Boom for Arbitrary Power.
Chief Justice Puller then advanced the
proposition enunciated in MarburR vs.
Madison,- lirst Cranch,,that the constitu
tion was written in order to define and
limit and keep within Its restricted bound
aries all persons and departments of gov
ernment and was meant to leavo no room
for the play and action of purely personal
and arbitrary power. He added:
Krom Marburg vs. Madison to the' present
day no utterance of this court has Intimated
a doubt that In Its operation on the peoplo by
whom and for whom It was established' tho
national Government Is a Government of
t numerated powers, the exercise of uMch in
restricted to tho use of means appropriate and
plainly adapted by. constitutional ends, ami
which arc "not prohibited, but consist
with the letter and spirit of the constitution,"
the powers delegated by the people to their
agents ore not enlarged by the ' expansion of
th domain within which they arc exercised.
When tho restriction on tha exercise of a par
ticular power by a particular agent Is-ascer*
talned, that Is an end of the question.
To hold otherwise is to overthrow the basis
of our constitutional law and, moreover, In
effect, to rcasicrt the proposition â¢ that tho
Hi at r * and not tho people created tho Govern
ment. â¢

Â¦ Majority Concurring Opinion.
' The ', concurring opinion of the* majority
recognizes . that Congress," ln dealing , with
a foot of American territory, and all ter
ritory incorporated Into tha United States
wus taken under a pledge that it should
Lt forever a part of the United States.
He cited the Louisiana Purchase and
other Instances, where considerable time
elapsed prior to â¢incorporation, and sum
marized his views as follows:
It U then, as I think. Indubitably settled hy
the principles of the law of nations, by the
nature of the Government created under the
constitution, by the express and Implied powers
conferred upon that Government by the consti
tution, by the mode In which those powers have
been executed from the beginning and by an
unbroken line of decisions of this court, first
announced by Marshall, and followed and lu
cidly expounded by Taney. that the treaty
making; power cannot Incorporate territory Into
the United Stales without the expressed and
implied assent of Congress, that It may assert
in a treaty conditions aitaJrm Immediate lncor-
Iteration. It must follow, therefore, that where
a treaty contains no condition! for Incorpora
tion, and, above all, where lt not only haa no
â¢ucli conditions, but expressly provides to the
contrary. Incorporation docs not arise, until,
In the wisdom of Congress, It Is deemed that
the acquired territory has reached that state
where it la proper that lt should enter Into
and form a part of the American family.
To Be Determined by Congress.
Attention was then -called to the fact
that the trtaty' of peace expressly pro
vided that the civil rights and political
etatu* of the inhabitants of tho Islands
rhould be determined by Congress, and
the conclusion was stated as follows:
The result of what has been said is that
while in an international sense Porto Rico was
rot a foreign country it was foreign to the
United States In a domestic een?e, because the
island had not been incorporated Into the
United States, but waa merely appurtenant
thereto as a possession. As a necessary conse
quence the impost in question assessed on mer.
fhandipe coming from Porto Rico Into the
United States after the cession was within the
powers of Congress, and that body was not.
moreover, as to eueh Impost, controlled by the
clause requiring that imposts should ! be uni
form throughout the United States; In other
words, the provision of the constitution Just
referred to was not applicable to Congress In
licriElating for Porto . Rico.
In concluding, it was said that the
question when Porto Rico was to be in
corporated was a political question, to
be determined by the American, people,
ppeakinsr through Congress, and was not
for the courts to determine.
Justice Gray announced his concur
rence in the majority's conclusion in the
Dowries case and in doing: so said in
substance:
The civil covernment of the United States
cannot extend Immediately and of iu own
force over territory acquired by war. Such
territory murt necessarily. In tht first instance,
tx- governed by the military power, under the
control of the President, as commander in
chief. Ci\-ll government cannot take effect a*
soon as possession is acquired under military
authority, or even as soon as that posneÂ»*lon
is corn mod by treaty. It can bÂ« permanent in
operation only by the action of the appropriate
political doartment of the Government, at
rurh time and In euch decree as that depart
ment may determine. There must, of neces
sity, he a transition i>eriod.
Bo long as CnnrrMK nsÂ« not Incorporated the
territory Into the United fitatet neither military
occupation nor censlon by treaty makes the
conquered territory domestic territory In tho
â¢rnÂ«t of revenue laws. Hut those laws con
cerning "foreirn countries" Temaln applicable
to the conquered territory until chang-ed by
ConirrcM. Buch was the unanlmoui opinion
Â«if this court, as declared by Chief Justice
Teney In Fleming- vs. Pare. 9.
If Congress. Is not ready to construct a com
pine government of the conquered territory
it may enobllnh a temporary government,
Mhl'li I* not subject to all the restriction* of
. the constitution.
Kuch was the effect of the act of OonnreÂ«s
of April 12. l>00. entitled "An act temporarily
to provide revenues and a civil Government for
Pcrto Rico, and for other purposes." The sys
tem of duties temporarily established by that
act during the- transition period was within
the authority of Concreos under the constitu
tion of the United States.
Chief Justice Fuller Dissents.
The chief dlswntlng opinion In the
Dowries cane was announced by Clilff
Justice Fuller, JuÂ»tlcea Harlan, Brewer

ST. PETERSBURG, May 27.â ThÂ© pro
hibition of the publication of the NovoÂ«
Vremya for a week because of Its edi
torial article on the labor troubles la
creating an immense sensation as indi
cating extraordinary nervousness on tha
part of the Government. -
The Novoo Vremya is second only to tha
Moscow VladomotiÂ© in conservatism and
is usually allowed greater latitude than
are the other papers. The editorial In
question is mild as compared with many
Governmental publications on the labor
situation in more quiet times. It merely
said the operatives were poorly paid for
excessively hard work and were beginning
to be influenced by Western literature and
suggested that tho Government carry on
the work begun for emancipation and en*
force social reforms. . ,t-j> - . â¢

The explosion was caused by what Is
known among miners as a "blown blast."
It is the custom of the miners to place
blasts and fire them oft at quitting time
each afternoon, leaving the coal thus
thrown down to be , loaded and hauled
from the mine the next- morning. The
Richland mine Is destitute of water and
great volumes of I fine particles , of coal
dust invisible to the naked eye accumu
lated at the roof of the mine. This after
noon at 4:30 o'clock a dynamite cartridge
was placed in position in one of the rooms
for a blast and tho miners started for the
mouth of the mine. The blast did not ex
plode as intended, but Instead, .a long
flame shot out of the blast hole and ig
nited the accumulation of dust. Instantly
a terrlllo explosion occurred and a seeth
ing mass of- flame shot to the mouth of
the mine and extended 300 feet into the

open air, scorcmrtff the leaves from the
nearby trees. â¢ There were thirty-four men
In the mine at the time. Four of these ea
caped with slight Injuries. Twenty-dno
were klllt'd nnd nine terribly burned, most
of them fatally. The force of the explo*
Nlon caused great mossex of coal and slate
to cave In from the roof of the mine and
many fated miners were completely
burled.
Word quickly reached Day ton. and rÂ«i<
cue forces were at once organized and
proceeded to the mine. , One by one the
blackened and horribly disfigured bodies
were taken from the debris and carried
to the mouth of the mine, where they
were put on a locomotive and taken to
I'uyton. Scores of relatives and friends
gathered at tho mouth of the mine and
the shrieks of anguish as the bodies
were removed were heartrending. .
The two undertaking establishments at
Dayton were turned into morgues, whero
the mangled bodies were dressed and
prepared for delivery to their families.
All the men employed In this mine wero
residents of Dayton.
The Richland mine Is the property of
the Dayton Coal and Iron Company, com
posed of Glasgow capitalists. The com
pany operates an iron furnace at Dayton.
GETS THE VERDICT
/ IN A DAMAGE STTIT
Sequel to a Newspaper Controversy
Between Two Modesto
Dentists. â¢
' MODESTO, May 27.â The suit of Dr. M.
L. Cooper for $10,000 against Emery and
Laud Gates was tried In the. Superior
Court to-day. The Jury returned a ver
1 diet in favor of Dr. Cooper, awarding him
$330 damages. The judgment carries with
it the costs of court.
The case was the outgrowth of a news
paper controversy laat February, In which
Dr. Cooper and Dr. W. F. Green, rival
dentists, referred to each other in uncom
plimentary terms through the local press.
Borne of tne effusions were in verse. The
Gates brothers, who are â¢ brothers-in-law
of Dr. Green, resented the articles by as
saulting Dr. Cooper, who sustained In
juries about the face and body during a
street flffht. Emery Gates struck the blows,
while Laud Gates was near and was ac
cused of being a party to the assault.
Virtue Is Its own rewardâ and no ques
tions asked.
It Is ridiculous to think that fruits and vege
tables raised on the elopes of the distant Pa
cific ehould compete at the very doors of Spain
with thos* produced in this country, yet the
fact la undeniable. How Is the mystery ex
plained? It Is simply this: Spain sends her
fruit and vegetables In the worst possible con
dition, so far as packing and transportation
are concerned; piled on wretched railway cars,
exposed to sun and rain and reaching Paris
from fourteen to seventeen days after their de
parture from Valencia; while the Callfornlana
offer their fruit in the came fine condition In
which It Is ricked from me trees. Their or
anges, apples, peaches and pears reach Paris,
after traversing 6000 miles, In a more attrac
tive and appetizing condition than ours after
* Journey of only 490 mllei.

CALL BUREAU, 1408 G 8TREET, N.
w., WASHINGTON, May 27,-The recoff
nized excellence of California fruit*
abroad and their successful competition
with Spanish fruita appears from tho fol
lowing translation from a Valencia paper
received at the Slate Department from
Consul Bartleman of that city under date
or April 10, 1901:
Epanlsh product! are rapidly losing ground,
Â«.nd unless our methods be brought Into llnÂ«
with those of progressive nations, our wines,
our oil, our fruiu and vegetables will bÂ« con
flcmned to home consumption. We have been
astonished at the falling oft in our exports of
irult and fresh vegetables to France, England
and Germany. The decrease for France, not
withstanding the enormously enlarged con
sumption created by the Paris exposition, was
erroneously attributed to Italian competition.
The rivalry really comes from the United
States. California Is now supplying the
French. English and German markets with
freBh fruit and vegetables. The fruits are not
offered at lower prices than our own, but they
are presented neatly packed and In eplendld
condition.
Our Products Are Steadily
Crowding Out Those of
Europe.
Spain Feels California
Is a Dangerous

SIDNBT,- Neb., May 27.-The Presiden

homeward Journed without incident. The
trip across Wyoming was at an average
elevation of 4000 feet, and at Bhorman,
Just before the train began. to descend tho
eastern slope of the Itocky Mountains, the
elevation exceeded 7000 feet. Brief stops
wero made for water and to change en
gines at Bawllns, Laratnle and Cheyenne,
Wyo., and Klmball arid Sidney, Neb. The
President made no < remarks at., any of
these places, but he appeared upon tho
rear platform and shook hands with some
of those nearest the car. There were
crowds at every station along the route
and every cattle ranch had its little group
of cowboys sitting bolt upright on their
horses and waving' their sombreros as the
train went by. . '
Mrs. McKinley is standing the trip well.
The weather has been exceedingly pleas

Chicago to the Pennsylvania line, and
proceed without further stops.
- The President and Cabinet received of
ficial information here that the Supreme
Court, had decided the Insular cases in ac
cordance with the contentions of the Gov

Cabinet officers were elated, 1 although
they have never doubted that the decision
would be in favor of the Government. The

'I "will try conclusions with, Terrence
â¢jl McGovern, better known to the
ring as "Terrible Terry," the
champion featherweight of .: the world.
Victory to Herrera means fame and dol
lars,, Defeat: to McGovern ; signifies the
loss of all the 'laurels he has won in a
ecore of hard fought contests, :- and per
haps oblivion: Both men, having much at
stake, have trained for their twenty-round
battle and are rfeady to enter the ring in
â¢the", best -of fettle. They have worked
faithfully and with a view to undergoing
a grueling contest. ."., Â¦ Â¦
Herrera will carry "the hopes and the
dollars of the entire oil belt-on his should
ers. That he wiil do his utmost to achieve
a victory is beyond dispute. He is "an
ambitious youngster and is possessed of a
punch which if it lands on an opponent j
cuts short his aspirations. â¢ Herrera is. a,
Spanish-American boy and was brought (
up ' In ; Bakersfield. Â¦ jHe has- gradually
fought his way'to the,top of the pugilistic j
heap, and through .his. manager has sue- i
ceeded in securing a match with McGov- j
em, the "king-pin" in two classes. Man
ager Carillo has .watched over Herrera
i with. the fond eye of a parent. He has
seen his protege defeat such good men as
Toby . Irwin and Tommy . Cox, Â¦ and with
the confidence . born of " conviction has
wagered thousands of dollars on his man s
chances. - , . / -

On the other" hand. Sam Harris, the
alert manager of McGovern, has supreme

the fights. His past decisions have won
him the respect of ring-goers and he is the
choice of the contestants. "' .'
: Sam Harris,, manager of the feather
weight champion, announced last night
that he had $5000 to bet on McGovern at
the prevailing odds, and that he would
bet", $2000 even â¢ that the champion would
win inside of ten rounds.
The. curtain raiser will be presented by
Dukelow and Fincke, - two amateurs who
have graduated into the â¢ professional
ranks. 'These two fought two years ago
in the amateur tournament . N held at the
Olympic Club and Fincke secured a deci
sion. by a narrow^ margin. Dukelow has
since won 1 the amateur championship of
the United - States and has always been
anxious ta -wipe' out Â¦Â¦ the. defeat he suf
fered at Fincke's hands. He came out
here a few months ago. with this end in
view, but was unable to get a/match. The
local boxing club saw the opportunity and
signed the men to- box ten rounds for a
decision. They* are clever and hard hit
ters. Fincke has defeated many good ama
teurs and Dukelow has had the benefit of
training McGovern for his fight with
Gardner.- . . ,
That the -Mechanics' Pavilion will be
crowded is a certainty. The sale of tick
ets opened at Corbett's on Saturday and
blocks of chairs were purchased. Every
one is anxious to see McGovern in action
again. He had such an easy time defeat
ing Oscar Gardner that ring-goers are" de
sirous of watching him work against a
man who' is capable of giving and with
standing punishment. â¢ .
The preliminaries to the Wg fight are
the best to be had. "Kid" McFadden and

MEMORIAL DAY
PLANS ACCEPTED
The Bay City Athletic Club is either the
most unfortunate .athletic institution in
the world, or it possesses a very poor
matchmaker. Nearly every exhibition
: given by that club In the last six months
has been marred by fake boxing bouts
and the permitting of untrained men In
! the ring. Last night's exhibition in the
Mechanics' Pavilion Annex was no excep
tion to the rule, liiight bouts .were pre
sented and of that number two 'were pal
pable fakes and a third was spoiled by an
untrained boy entering the ring.
"Kid" Parker and Jerry Fairbanks were
first on the programme. Both lads were
newspaper venders and fast friends. They
struck each other with open gloves until
the referee warned them to fight properly.
The bout was a poor on^ and was won
by Parker. Jack McCormick and; Joe
Howard put up a splendid battle. Both
blocked cleverly - and landed hard and
with frequency. Howard was much bigger
and stranger than, his opponent and â¢ sq
cured a decision. "Kid" Angelo knocked
Joe Reno â¢ out in two rounds. Angelo
played for Reno's body and before the
first round "closed it took on a ruddy hue.
In the second Angelo sailed in and . bat
tered Reno to the carpet, 'but the plucky
boxer was up and ready for more. One
of his seconds, humanely threw up the
towel and Reno was led weeping from the
"Young Kid" McFadde'n secured a de
cision over Mike Haley after four rounds
cf heavy fighting. Haley would ,< have"
made a "better showing had hie seconds
remained quiet. Their continuous coach
ing bewildered the boy more than the
blows- McFadden showered on him.
Harry Baker, a. weak newsboy, who had
been ordered not to enter the ring by the
club's doctor, disobeyed the admonition
and tried -conclusions with hard-hitting-
Frankie Neil. Baker lasted one minute
and a half/ He picked out a. soft spot and
remained there until counted out. He af
terward admitted that he -had split the
purse and had not trained a minute for
the contest;* It is Just such cases as this
that result 1 in ring fatalities. "Cyclone"
Kelly and Harry Foley boxed two rounds
in a sllpBhod fashion and the club man
agers â¢ ordered - them ( taken out of - the
ring. The' pair left the arena in a crest
fallen manner. Â»>
: Nobby Otts and Dan Barry put up the
best bout of the night. They, hammered
each other for - four rounds and as. neither
man had the advantage an extra round
was called. As the amateur rule3 will not
permit an extra round, the bout was
stopped after one minute's . fighting and
Otts was Â¦ given a well deserved < decision: :
Teddy Wolfe knocked Red Kelly into in
sensibility in two rounds. -Kelly^showed
lack, of training and science and was no
match for his clever opponent. . _ Â¦

The attendance was good,' and - first
choices rewarded their backers by tak
ing three purses. Ten books chalked
prices and were kept busy. Fauntleroy,
Alexander, Hoar, Armstrong,;' Stuart and
Bozeman each rode a winner.
-As the track was soft, Intrepido with
his bad legs found his way to favoritism,
in the betting on the opening sprint.
The gelding passed Senator Matis on the
way home, and standing a drive gamely,
defeated Sisctuoc a head. v. Â¦
Prejudice, now owned by Burns and
Waterhouse, came out fresh looking as a
May poppy for the seven furlong run fol
lowing, and at scant odds won - all the
way. The mare will take same beating
from now on. Eight lengths away, Cas
dale ran in eight lengths before Burdock
for the place. :
Then followed the surprise of the .card.
With all the smart ones unloading on
Willie Sink's Royalty to win the five
furlong dash for two-year olds, Yellow
stone, a' 20 to 1 shot turned them all
down. The outsider early assumed the
lead, and though hard pressed* at the
close by Vasallo, lasted long enough to
get the decision by a head. Quadra led
Royalty out for third place.
Right on top of this came the victory
of another somewhat neglected one in
the betting. The books chalked 10 to 1
against Eddie Kauffman's mare . Katie
Wolcott, and well ridden by Armstrong,
she dropped in first, a length ahead of
La Calma, the Elmwood farm entry.
Rasp, the favorite, ended up in fourth po
sition, apparently unable to get up.
A large sized package of coin - was
dumped into the ring on High Hos to
get away with the final number, and the
mare delivered the merchandise. . Backed

UNPAID TAXES
ARE NOT HEAVY
Auditor and Collectoi
Strike an Annual
Balance.
Owners of Personal Property
Are Still Owing
$76,000.
-'- ?""Â¦:
The annual accounting between thei
ditor and the Tax Collector was practi
cally completed yesterday. Some idea oi
the financial condition of the munldpallts
may be obtained from it. â¢
On the books of the Auditor the Taa
Collector is charged with $90,293 47 on per
sonal property unsecured by real estate,
On this has been collected and paid to the
Treasurer $14,019 81, leaving a balance due
of $76,273 66. On personal property secure*
by real estate the figures show the as
sessment amounted to $l,331,33o 83. Collec
tions amounted to $1,280,377 60, leaving a
balance of $50,953 22. . Â¦ â¢ -
The amount charged to the first in
stallment of taxes on real estate is ?3.3Â«.
311 48, and of this $2,313,227 65 was jwJd In.
the outstanding balance being $26,083 83.
On the second installment $2,344,311 oO was
charged and $2,296,247 77 collected, $48,064 X
remaining delinquent.
All assessments combined aggregated
$6,110,252 28 and the amounts collected *>,
908.872 23. leaving an apparent uncollected
balance of S201.3SO 05. The Board of Equal
ization further reduced the assessment,
leaving a balance of $198,794 72. It is ex
pected that some $50,000 will be paid in be
fore the sale, reducing the amount tc
$148,794 72. Another item to be considered
is the refunding of about $100,000 levied as
taxe3 on the stocks of national banks, a
matter which is now in dispute in the
courts. This leaves ' the amount delin
quent $48,794 72. The estimated penalty or
the total delinquency is $32,504.
Although the amount of taxes remain
ing unpaid has been less in several years
previous, it i3 proportionately lower, wher
the amount of the tax levy of the com
pared fiscal years is taken Into consider
ation. According to Auditor Wells it
shows a most gratifying financial state.
"I think when accounts are balanced ai
the end of the year." said the Auditor yes
terday afternoon, "that we will have had
the most successful year in the history ol
our city as far as finances are concerned.

King Edward Vll, then Duke of Cornwall.
Sydney Smith, preaching at St. Paul's
Cathedral, made an addition of the Bid
ding Prayer as follows:
"We pray also for that infant of the
royal race whom in thy good Providence
thou hast given us for our future King.
We beseech Thee so to mold his heart
and fashion his spirit that he may become
a blessing and not an evil to the land of
his birth. May he grow in favor with
man, by leaving to its own force and di
rection the energy of a free people. May
he grow in favor with God by holding the
faith of Christ . fervently and feelingly,
without feebleness, without fanaticism,
without folly. As he will be the first man
in these realms, so may he be the best;
disdaining to hide bad actions by high
station, and endeavoring always by the
example of a strict and moral life to re
pay those gifts which a loyal people are
so willing to spare from their own neces
sities to a good King."â New York Sun.

Secretary Root Says That He
Can Do Nothing For
â¢ Them.
Â¦WASHINGTON. May 27.â The, five
cadets dismissed by the Secretary from
the West Point Military Academy called
at the War Department this afternoon
and 'were presented to Secretary Root by
Senator Hawley of Connecticut and Sen
ator Cockrell of Missouri. The object of
the cadets' visit was to complain to Sec
retary Root that action had been taken in
their cases without giving them access to
the testimony against them, or without
permitting them to offer any testimony in
reply to the charges made as to their con
duct. Each" cadet made a long- statement
to Secretary Root, and all. were persistent
In their representations that they had not
been treated fairly. At the conclusion of
their statements Secretary Root asked
them if they had not .been given a copy of
the r'.^rgres against them, and they re
plied .\ the affirmative. They also admit
ted beli.g- in a group that mad^va demon
stration against Superintendent Mills.*
Secretary Root told, them he could do
nothing for them; that the action of the
War Department was final, and that they
would not be given an opportunity to
have the question reopened. After leaving
Secretary Root's office they went to the
office of General Davis, Judge Advocate
General, whom they knew when he was
instructor of law at West Point, and re
newed their j efforts to impress the auth
oritleswith the justice of their - claims,
but without avail.

p^p^HE Importance of Being Earnest,"
I a trivial comedy by Oscar Wilde,
I , was presented at the Columbia
1L Theater last evening- by Henry
/ Miller and his talented company.
The audience was keenly alive to^the wit
and satire of which Wilde was a mas
ter and the clever work of Miller
and his associates brought out the
heartiest approval of those who wit
nessed the play; Miller's company is not
as strong as it was last season and while
the performance last night was excellent,
it lacked the finesse that characterized
the previous presentations of Miller's
company. Margaret Anglin and E. J.
Morgan are not easily replaced. Of
those who shared the success of last
night, special mention must 1 ' be accord
ed to Miss Jennie Eustace and Miss
Florence Rockwell. The change from a
costume play to a society comedy serves
to show the versatility of Miller and his
company. "The Importance of Being
Earnest" is well presented and should
serve to crowd the theater during the
week.

Dowell last night an open handed w"el
come, as warm as a California 'summer,
and filled the Grand Opera-house with
a ' discriminating and well pleased audi
ence that applauded all the good things
in Victorlen Sardou's , "Cleopatra," and
was tolerant of the indifferent. | The
costumes were . rich, the scenery beauti
ful, and the spirit of the play well car
ried out. Mr. MacDowell has Improved
in appearance and even, in style since we
last saw him and he .well earned the ap
plause that was showered upon his first
appearance. . Florence Stone made the
most of the role of -the Egyptian queen
and, although boisterous where force was
Indicated in the lines, amply made up
for that error by the excellence of her,
acting in the magnificent fourth act, the
gem of the play. Jack Webster, ; the
Kephren, was over loud and authoritative
for a slave. The thunder storm, before
the temple of Isis was well worked up
and earned' curtain . calls for the princi
pal characters." "Cleopatra" will have a
good' week's run . if the reception * last
night is to be taken as an indication.
Central.
"The War of Wealth" began what prom
ises to be a most successful engagement
at the Central Theater last night. ;Tho

ing arid lurid complications in I almost
every act.. .. Robert Cummings- as Â¦ John
Warfleld' In the leading role Â¦ earned re
peated applause for his emotional work.

The "First Born" began its second week
at the Alcazar last evening. There was

BIG HAUL IDE
BY BUNKO MEN
Son of Hawaiian Planter
Is Fleeced Out of
$5000.
*7
Victim Advised to Go Home,
but He Finally Informs
the Police.
One of the most successful swindles
ever perpetrated by bunko men In this
city was consummated yesterday morn
ing when 55000 was obtained by four con
fidence men from the son of a millionaire
planter of the Hawaiian Islands.
The young man recently arived from
Hawaii and brought a letter of credit for
$3000 on the Anglo-Californian Bank. Yes
terday morning, while walking on Mar
ket Ftrec-t, the ycung Hawaiian was ac
costed by a well dressed man, who struck
up an acquaintance. The bunko steerer
was "Sheeny Kid." whose face adorns
the Rogues' Gallery of many cities. The
swindler told his 'Hawaiian friend that
he was the nephew of a well-known mil
lionaire, who has large interests in Ha
waii. Finally the victim was induced to
go to the Anglo-California Bank and cash
his letter of credit.
In a little while the Hawaiian was
steered to a room at 21 Grant avenue,
where "Billy McDonald," "Morgan,"
alias "Cruiser Jim," and "Foster." alias
"Crooked," were engaged in a game of
poker. The Hawaiian was Induced to
take a hand and the old "mitt-game"
was sprung on him. He was allowed to
win at first, and finally, when the stakes
were heavy, he was dealt four kings.
Excited at his previous good fortune, the
victim did not allow himself to be bluffed.
When all his money was on the table, he
was "called"' by one of the gang, who
held four sees.
The Hawaiian was staggered at his loss,
and the men who fleeced him promised to
help him out of his trouble. They told
him that "gentlemen" never paid back
their winnings, but prave him $200 and a
bogus check for SSOOO on a bank in Ha
waii. The victim was advised to say noth
ing as to his escapade. Â¦ but to leave the
city for a few days and return to Hawaii
as soon as he could. The Hawaiian was
escorted to the ferry building and was
left there. Finally realizing- that he was
the victim of bunko-steerers. the , Ha
waiian sought a police officer and told
his story. He was escorted to police
headquarter? and Captain of Detectives
Seymour was able to identify the bunko
men by the descriptions furnished. De
tectives Wren and Bfnan were sent out to
round up the quartet of rogues, and their
victim was taken to his hotel to ponder
over the pitfalls that menace a stranger
in large cities.
HONOLULU. H. T.. May 16.â A joint
committee of the Legislature yesterday
paid a visit to Quarantine Island landing
to inspect the immigrants" brought here by
the steamer Colon. They are Porto
Ricans and were declared to be In need of
food and rest before they would be strong
enough to stand the trip to s the other
islands.
The trip of the legislators resulte'd in
disagreement as to the condition of the
immigrants and their value as new citi
zens of Hawaii. The three Senators who
were en the committee have mado a
unanimous renort to the effect that the
Porto. Ricans are all right, but it Is under
stood that John Emmeluth of the House
Committee will present a report severely
denouncing the planters for bringing the
Porto Ricans here and on account of al
leged ill-treatment of them when they ar
rived.
More than half the immigrants on the
Colon were women and children ai:d a
considerable number of the men were in
firm, while all were more or less emaci
ated. This is attributed to lack of food In
their old homes. Some of thosÂ« who came
will never be able to work and Jt is said
the planters will enpage representatives
to act for them In Porto Rico and see that
no more such immigrants are sent heie at
their expense. Objection is made here to
the bringing in of so many children, who
will have to be educated at the expense of
the Territory, and of many men and wo
men who are said to be unlikelv to ever
become healthy and strong..

.?? What is Malaria? ...
MALARIA is One of the most subtle affections with which we have to deal.
There is iW a hamlet or town in this country in which malaria is not found. It
is a- peculiar poison circulating or existing in the air, a .result of veg-
etable decomposition, â poisons emanating from the soil. Its most marked ac-
tion is upon the kidneys and liver, yet it gives rise to other complaints as well,
each of which, however, can be traced primarily to the fact that the kidneys
and liver have become diseased Q
The presence of malaria can be recognized by the fact that there are
chills or fever, headache, backach^ pain in the loins or extremities, sweat-
ing, sometimes profuse, other times but littlei marked '
There are cases tint are termed dumb ague which are malarious in charac-
ter, in winch there is no sweating, and but rarely any fever, yet a continued
malaise, a lack of energy and buoyancy, in fact a prostration which com-
pletely enervates the sufferer, causing tired feelings, headaches, neuralgia,
enlargement and hardening of the liver, and Bright's disease of the kidneys.

OUR FRUIT IN EUROPE.
VOICES from Europe complaining of the effects
of American competition have become com
monplaces, but none the less they, are interest
ing. Each successive repetition is but another assur
ance of the expanding market for our products and
another stimulus to further enterprise. It is there
fore worth noting that in addition to the complaints
so frequently heard from Great Britain, France, Ger
many and Austria, there comes now a complaint from
Spain, coupled with a warning to the Spanish .people
that they must improve in their methods of doing
business or they will lose altogether a trade that in the
past has been highly profitable to them.
The Spanish complaint is of especial interest 'â¢ to
Californians because it refers to the fruit trade â¢ in
Europe, and notes our advance in markets which
have hitherto relied largely upon Spanish gardens,
orchards and vineyards for their supplies. It occurs
in an article recently published in a Valencia paper,
a translation of which has been furnished by Consul
Bartleman of that city to the -State Department.
After pointing out that there has been a heavy
diminution of Spanish exports of wines, oil, fruit and
vegetables to France, Great Britain and Germany,
and noting that the competing supplies are drawn
from California, the paper says: "It is ridiculous to
think that fruits and vegetables' raised on the slopes
of the distant .Pacific should compete at the very
doors of Spain with those produced in this country,
yet the fact is undeniable. How is the mystery ex
plained? It is simply this:, Spain sends her fruit and
vegetables in the worst possible condition, so far as
packing and transportation are concerned; piled on
wretched railway cars, exposed to sun and rain, and
reaching. Paris from fourteen to seventeen days after
their departure from Valencia; .while the Califor
nians offer their fruit in the same fine condition in
which it is picked from the trees. ? * * Shall we
live to see the American oranges competing with ours
in the Valencia market itself?"
From the tenor of the complaint it appears that
American commercial competition may, teach Spain
as much in, the way of advanced business methods as
our navy taught her of the art of war." Moreover, in
these days when Americans are so loud in" complaints
of the railway service of the country it is worth noting
this evidence of its' vast superiority' over that of one
at' least of our European rivals. \ Evidently in our
transportation facilities we have, more to brag of than
to complain of, since, it is by rrfeans of them that we
may yet succeed in selling California oranges in the
markets of Valencia itself. .
BRITISH PRESS ON CARNEGIE.
THE British press is just now busy at baiting
Andrew Carnegie. The Scotch universities
were poverty stricken. They found themselves
long on reputation, but short on funds, apparatus,
laboratories and the muniments which are needful to
a modern university. The reputation of Adam Smith
and Kit North is a valuable asset. A long line of
Lords Rector, bejeweied with the names of Carlyle,
Disraeli and Gladstone, is a good thing to have, but
none of these supplied the place of the facilities de
manded for tbe teaching of modern science and the
payment of adequate salaries to a faculty.
Andrew Carnegie had the good luck, for Scotland,
to be born in the land o* cakes, and the good luck
also, for himself and the world, to be reared in the
United. States. He has made a fortune too large for
his own use. Indeed he regards it as an incumbrance,
and whether he is an agnostic, as charged, or a be
liever in the plan of salvation as counter-charged, he
has scruples against flying rich. He has therefore a
pardonable desire to indulge in the distribution of his
estate ante-mortem, and a hope that the probate
court may be left free to distribute the estates of
poorer men so promptly that they will not go to the
lawyers.
Observing the distressed condition of the Scotch
universities he produced his check book and prepared
to draw one for the trifle of $10,000,000 of lucre,
which those institutions require to put them on their
scholastic legs again.
The British press regards this as an insult to the
whole nation and a bruising blow to Scottish pride.
Therefore it advises the universities to refuse the gift,
and reminds the Scottish lairds" that their pride will
not permit them to send their sons to drink of the
Pierian spring made affluent by an "ironmonger's
purse." The. result is awaited with interest in the
British Isles and also in this country. Scotland is
not afraid of ironmongers or other people who have
had to work for a living or acquire fortunes in trade.
Scotch genius has not been born in the purple.
Burns was a plowboy, and never knew any better way
of getting bread than out of the soil. James Hogg
was a sheep herder, and as for Carlyle, he was born
to poverty, and had plenty of it in stock even after
his pen had made him famous. MacQueen was ' a
Paisley weaver, and Wilson was a country editor.'.
But the London papers complain that the United
States is becoming the owner of the world's capital
and is in danger of buying up .the whole kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, universities and all. Per
haps that is the real Tub. If Andrew Carnegie should
use his money to stimulate general education in Great
Britain Darby and Joan might take a notion to dis
place some of the existing ruling classes and change
places with them.* If this country is becoming the
owner of the world's capital it must be because of the
opportunity furnished by our political institutions.
Europe was a new country a long; time back, and in
the day of her adolescence probably roused the same
feeling in the older East that she now feels toward the
bumptious, rich and pushing New World.
In the latest number of the Commoner, Bryan say's:
'The principal value of education lies in the fact that
it disciplines the mind, enlarges the horizon, and en
ables one to view jnen and things in their proper re
lations." Since Bryan has such a clear perception of
that truth, the wonder will be greater than ever that
he doesn't go somewhere and get an education.

INDIA AND HER INDUSTRIES.
WE have heard much of late concerning the
effect of American competition upon the in
dustries of Europe, and now British India
comes forward with complaints. It appears that our
enterprise has seriously interfered with several of the
greater industries of the East Indian people, and par
ticularly with that of the tanners. Tanned skins and
hides have long constituted one of the chief exports
of Madras, but of late the raw skins and hides have
been shipped to the United States and the tanners
have been nearly driven out of business. A memorial
was recently presented to the Indian Government
asking" that an export duty be imposed upon the raw.
material so as to check the effects of our competition.
That complaint is the more interesting because
there have been complaints in Great Britain of the
disastrous effects of Indian competition upon British
industries. In a recent lecture in London Sir Richard
Temple, one of the leading authorities on India, said
Indian manufactures of various goods are supplanting
the products of British factories to a very large ex
tent, and that machinery is working a revolution in
the industrial relations between Great Britain and the
Indian empire.
â¢ A summary of his address given by the London
Chronicle reports him as having said that not many
years ago most of the jute crop of Bengal was sent
to Dundee and other manufacturing centers of the
British Islands, but now capitalists have established
factories in. Bengal, and last -year they ex
ported manufactured jute goods to the value
of more than $20,000,000. The progress of cot
ton manufacturing has been - yet more remark
able, ;for within the last twenty years the cot
ton spindles of India have increased 221 per cent and
the looms 189 per cent. Last year they manufactured
1,641,000 bales of raw cotton. It iss added: "India
does not yet manufacture the finer grades of cotton
goods, but her. coarse fabrics are becoming more and
more popular in markets where she has the special
advantage of comparative proximity. Thus she is now
selling $15,000,000 worth of coarse cottons, most of
them in Mozambique, Zanzibar and: Aden, whence
they are distributed in East Africa. Her trade in these
goods is also growingin Abyssinia, Ceylon, Turkey
and the Strait Settlements. Her increasing product
of cotton fabrics enables the home industry to keep
pace with the growing demand both in India and
foreign- markets." . , â¢ ,
The apparent conflict- between the demand of the
Madras tanners for^protection and the ability of the
Bengal jute and cotton manufacturers to defy
competition shows in what seemingly contrary
ways the streams of trade and commerce run.
The explanation is probably the^simple ' one
When one professor at Chicago University said that
Rockefeller is greater than Shakespeare, and another
said in his classroom that he had never kissed a girl in
his life, the offenses were pardonable; but now that
a third has declared no sensible man will marry a col
lege-bred woman it is time for Harper to make a clean
sweep.
As an illustration of the general policy
of the Ceylon Government toward the na
tives It Is Interesting to note that in the
last thirty years free grants of 40,000 acres
of land have been made, after due in
quiry, to the people, while a large extent
has been granted at half value and u still
larger area of clearly proved "encroach-,
ments" has been transferred at a moder
ate valpation.
But while Ceylon undoubtedly owes viÂ«ry
much to the fostering care of the British
officials and to the enterprise of the Euro
pean community generally. The "energy,
ability and real grit" of the 3,000,000 native
inhabitants of the island have n roved be
yond all question that, whether it oe in
the learned professions, in the civil der
vice or in trade â in all ranks and In all
classes â the native can ."not only imitate
but emulate the skill and the attainments
of the European colonist."
As regards education t>ie natives of Cey
lon owe a great debt of gratitude to the
various missionary bodies which, since
1814, have been at work among them. It
was they who grave the first impetus to
the Instruction of the people; It was not
until the '70s that the Government, under
Sir Hercules Robinson, gave any official
encouragement to education. Now, in
making liberal grants for public instruc
tion the Government of Ceylon pays spe
cial attention to technical and industrial
training, one very noticeable result of
which is to be seen In the great improve
ment in Â¦ appearance of the Cingalese
youth, especially in the towns, under the
Influence of Western instruction ond ath
letic training, while the expenditure of
public money in training and maintains
a volunteer Infantry has not only provid
ed a valuable means of supplementary
defense but has gone far to improve the
physique and bearing of the young men
of the' country.

What the British Government has done
In Ceylon, says John Ferguson, editor of
the Ceylon Observer, perhaps the greatest
living authority on the subject â in medical
treatment, hospitals, asylums and dispen
saries, in enforcing sanitary regulations,
and by the provision of a water supply in
the chief towns, is beyond all praise. No
native ruler In Oriental history has any
record of the kind to show and no feature
of the British administration is more ac
ceptable to the natives than the generous
provision thus made for the treatment of
their sick and suffering. Moreover, to the
prompt and effective measures taken by
the Government, no doubt, may De traced

other palms, additional activity in plum

of, the : great planting j enterprise, chiefly
in the ; hands of the colonists, of cacao
and cardamoms, but, above all. of tea,
there has been a marked advance In the
trade and revenue of the Island. In the
case of tea. the export trade, which began
in 1873 with twenty-three . pounds, has
grown in less than thirty years to the
gigantic dimensions of 125,000,000 pounds.
In the early days of British .rule the

The administration of the law is vested
in a Supreme Court,' consisting of a chief
Justice and two puisne Judges, and by dis
trict judges and police magistrates, many
of the natives holding lesser judicial of
fices. ,
The executive and administrative power
is in the hands of the Governor and six
official members, all British; while the
Legislative Council consists of the Gov
ernor with ten official and eight unofficial
members, the latter being nominated by
the Governor after consulting the various
public bodies and opinions; three of them
are Europeans, representing respectively
the planters, the merchants and the gen
eral European community; of the remain
ing five two are Cingalese, one is a Tamil,
the fourth represents the Moorsmen and
the fifth is a burgher or Eurasian. Thus,
while there is no pretense of a popular
elective government,' an attempt is made
to afford some degree of representation
in the Legislature to all the different sec
tions and interests of the inhabitants.

the Malays, Veddahs and various other
races, 200,000; the burghers,' including
those of pure Dutch descent, * as well as

climate and of rainfall; consequently the
products also are various., But though
the soil is rich there is no good natural
water communication, the rivers of Cey
lon being of but little use for navigation
or for storage. In olden days this want
was partially met by canals and 'reser
voirs constructed under the authority of
the native kings; but in later times of
trouble and invasion these channels and
tanks were allowed to go to ruin, and It
is only in comparatively recent years that
the Government has applied itself .to the
task of restoring them. . . .
Ceylon from time immemorial has been
famed for its gemsâ catseyes, sapphires,
rubles and other precious stones: The
pearl fishery, too, on the west coast, is
from time to time a valuable source of
revenue; and the salt monopoly in the
northwestern and southern provinces
yields a steady income to the Govern
ment. Plumbago is an important feature
in its mineral products, being exported
largely for the making of crucibles and
lead-pencils. â¢ .. * Â¦ . , . . ,
Attracted by the peculiarly healthful
climate, the beauty of the country and
the suitability of the soil, large numbers
of colonists from Great Britain made
their way to the up-country districts
sixty years ago to take advantage of the
great opportunities offered by the already
established coffee-planting industry,
which, in spite of a speedy and serious
check, soon recovered Itself and for some
years returned a rich reward for their in
vested capital and labor. But from 1880
onward first the "coffee bug" and then
the "leaf mold" proved so disastrous that
very many who had risked their fortunes
on coffee abandoned its cultivation. With
characteristic British "pluck," they root
ed, up acres upon acres of : their planta
tions, preferring all the risk of a new en
terprise to what appeared to be inevitable
ruin. Hence sprang that great cultiva
tion which has caused Ceylon tea to be
come a household word throughout the
civilized world.

The island has large resources, mainly

Resources of the Island.
Geographically Ceylon is an 1 appendage
of # India,- as Sicily is of Italy; but though
it 'has roughly followed the fortunes of
India in its history, it has never been an
Indian . province, but always a .separate
dependency, jtlte varied resources'make it
a land to be desired for Its own sake by
a commercial nation. , The , harbor of
Trincomalee is sufficient inducement to
make a naval power with an interest in
Eastern seas glad to possess it and eager
to keep it, holding as it does a singularly^
central position as a place of call on the
route from the west to the south and east.
So great, indeed, from the first has been
the value put upon Ceylon that at the
general peace in 1815, after the conquest
of Kandy, Great Britain elected rather -to
give up Java to the Dutch' in order to re
tain in her own hands the "key of India,"
inferior though It was in area, in popula
tion and in natural resources.
Ceylon is the largest, the most popu
lous and the most prosperous and pro
gressive of Great Britain's "crown colo
nies," so called because i the administra
tion of their affairs is directly under the
control of the British Colonial Office.
Â¦ The Cingalese have no poor Iaw3, r.or
do they need any: the weakest are tho
most cared for. The rich help their poor
relatives and do not disown, them: the
poor assist those of their own families and
friends who are poorer still, so that they
live in great contentment with no dread
of poverty in" old age.
The people of Ceylon are not only peace
able and law-abidingâ they are Intensely
loyal. No. colony is more attached to the
British crown, as they showed by ihe en
thusiastic welcome given to the different
Characteristic of the People.
ment, Colombo is also the largest town â
having a population of over 100,000, the
principal trade center, and since the con
struction of the breakwater works the
chief port of the island. When the new
harbor is finished three years hence Co
lombo will possess one of the largest and
best-protected harbors In the. world, hav
ing an inclosed area of 600 acres fully
equipped with numerous shipping con
veniences. In the Pettah, or native set
tlement, are found congregated together
in what has been described as "an ever
fascinating kaleidoscope," Cingalese,
Moorsmen, Tamils, Parsees, Dutch, Portu
guese, Malays and Afghans; "handi
craftsmen, working 1 in their open sheds,
women occupied in their, domestic affairs
and tiny children, clothed only in the rich
tints of their own complexions, sporting
among the traffic." .
From that description it would appear the hella-'
dotherium must have been the parent type of the
Democratic donkey, but he should not be blamed for
Bryanism, for no ancestor can be justly held respon
sible for the vagaries of degenerate descendants who
have evoluted away .from the original type by reason
of a mixture of blood or the excesses of pure cussed
ness. That, however, is a side" issue. The point of in
terest is that hunters are now seeking to capture one
of the beasts alive to take him to London, and before
long no menagerie will be complete without one. It
will be perceived, then, that in protecting the big
game of Africa the international'association is doing
much to add to the joy of some future San Francisco
holiday.
"The helladotherium is of the size of an ox; its neck
is a little longer, proportionately, than that of a horse,
the ears like those of the ass with silky black fringes,
the head taper-like and the nostrils like those of the
giraffe. The forehead is a vivid red, and the neck,
shoulders, stomach and back a deep. reddish brown,
and the hindquarters and legs are boldly striped in
purplish black and white.''
The animal has a sufficient distinction to make up
for the disappearance of the quagga and the zebra
from the attractions of menageries. He appears to be
almost as gay and gaudy as a tropical bird. A de
scription of hinr says: Â¦
As something of an ofl&et to the animals that are
disappearing,' it is reported that in the recesses of
Uganda there has been discovered alive an animal
hitherto known only by fossil remains found in
Greece. The newly found creature, known as the hella
dotherium, has been regarded as one of the oldest
types of animal creation or evolution; and the surviv
ing specimens have the honor of belonging to a race
that has withstood the* vicissitudes of at least two
geological ages.
In exploring the wilds of the interior of the conti
nent and gathering . information concerning the big
game it has been found that the quagga is either ex
tinct or else has become so scarce that one is not to
be found in- the districts they formerly frequented;
several species of antelope have also been . extermi
nated, zebras are very scarce, giraffes are disappearing
and the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus are now
comparatively few in number.
.A NEW THING FOR MENAGERIES.
SOME time ago The Call directed attention to the
â¢ organization Jof an international society for the
protection of the big game of Central and South
Africa. All the "-European nations having any ex

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
The Christian nations, after all the innocent, blood
they have shed and the tens of millions of Chinese
property they have stolen or destroyed, are demand
ing of distressed China a money indemnity in an
amount that would have scared the conscience of
Timour.
To our credit be it remembered that the civil gov
ernment of this republic, the secular power of this
nation, does , not forget the commandments, but
stands yet for justice, moderation and mercy. It
would- heal Christian self-respect and pride if the
churches would cease defending missionary looters
long enough to commend the President and Secre
tary of State for their high and honorable stand.
We submit to the Christian church at home, if it
is worth wjiile to continue missionary effort in a
country where the missionaries themselves jocundly
confess that they forget the commandments?
It is a dangerous example for a missionary to for
get one of the commandments. The brutal Euro
pean soldiery, from the standpoint of genuine Chris
tianity, were as justifiable in forgetting the other
commandments when they committed the unspeak
able crimes told by Sir Robert Hart, Dr. Dillon and
other observers. *
He is entitled to credit for entire frankness. He
does not even pretend that he was looting to relieve
the distress of native Christians or anybody else. He
forgot one of the commandments when he found
himself near unprotected property that did not be
long to him, and stole it.
Let it be remembered that Rev. Mr. Reid has long
lived in China disseminating there the principles
of that Teacher who said, "Love your enemies; re
turn not evil^for evil, but overcome evil with good."
But to him his enemies are despicable wretches, and
ne regrets lack of time to steal all they had, and la
ments that he had to leave much of their property to
be carried off by other thieves.
For weeks this gentle shepherd, whose life is lighted
by wisdom from on high, says that he "was -very
busy discriminating between the places that should
be looted and those that should -not. Now and then
I branched out to loot from those who were our ene
mies, and I only regret that I did not have more
time to loot from such despicable wretches, instead
of leaving so much to others. It has also grieved me
that so many really good people think that my loot
is good enough for them to want. The friends of
looters are beyond calculation." ,
We do not know what view the Rev. Mr. Ament
and the Board of Foreign Missions will take of Rev.
Mr. Reid's" frank admissions. That good man says:
"I confess I looted, and in good company. We en
tered the palace of Prince Li and found there French
soldiers and a French priest surrounded with vast
wealthâ iron 'safes containing nearly 300,000 taels in
silver, trunks laden with magnificent furs, silks and
satins, and rooms adorned with the finest Chinese art.
For a moment I forgot the tenth commandment. I
.had no house, no art, no books, no silver, no clothes
except a suit made for me by missionary ladies while
I lay in the hospital. The only trouble was- the
French were there; and were not kind enough to
leave. The French general came in and told us that
on that morning that section of ; the city had been
voted to the French. Seeing our downcast counte
nances he magnanimously said, 'I am very sorry, gen
tlemen; ; but each one may take a memento.' I se
cured two elegant furs and moved on."'
North China Herald prints a communication
from Rev. Gilbert Reid, a good missionary, who has
been carrying the consolations of Christianity to the
heathen who in his blindness bows down to -wood
and stone.
O t NE has to. read. the files of Oriental news
papers to get the facts, as to the devastation
of Chtna and the views of the missionaries
themselves on the ethics of looting.

The refusal of the water and light cor
porations to- comply with the ordinance
requiring tho payment of fees and the se
curing of a permit from the Board of
Public Works for the performance of
trenching work prompted the Board of
Supervisors to adopt retaliatory measures
yesterday. The board paÂ»Bed the follow
ing, resolution, presented by Curtis:
Whereas. Certain persona and corporations
refuse to comply with ordinances Nos. 288 and
253 of the Board of Supervisors providing: for
the payment of fees for inspection of work In
opening and closlnt? streets, and ' whereas, the
city is indebted for water and light to certain
of aaid corporations; therefore
Resolved, That notice be given to the Audi
tor of . these facts and his attention be re
spectfully called to section 6, chapter II, arti
cle III, of the charter, requiring him to deduct
amounts due the city from bills due by the
city to these corporations.
Resolved, That the Board of Public Works
be requested to notiry the Auditor of any fur
ther default by said corporations.
A. communication- was received from
George H. Roundey, president of the Uni
versity "Mound and Bay View Improve
ment Club, in which he agrees to give
bonds to furnish a new block book for the
Assessor's office for $1500. The Finance
Committee has recommended an expendi
ture of $8500 for, the purpose, and Koundey
asks that the balance of $7000 be expended
on San Bruno road, from. Fifteenth ave
nue to the county line.
"As. the Board of Public Works does not
knew the valuo of other people's money,"
concludes Roundey, significantly, "I sug
gest that the sum named be placed at tho
disposalof the Sheriff in order that he
may do the work with the prisoners.
Assessor Dodge addressed the board to
the effect that his demand for the block
book at a cost of $8500 was not excessive.
He said that the copy now in use was full
of incorrect descriptions of real estate,
and $10,000 yearly is expended to keep It
up. JJodgo took exception to the criti
cism of the Improvement clubs, snylng
that it was prompted by ignorance of the
true conditions.. The Mayor stated that
the members of the board will visit the
Assessor's oilice^to judge for themselves.
Teachers Ask for Searing.
In a communication George H. Roundey,
president of the Federation of Mission
Improvement Clubs, asked the board to
take into consideration In making the al
lowance to the Health Board that the fol
lowing named employes, all physicians,
Judging from the signs displayed in front
of their ofllces and residences, are not de
voting their whole time to the affairs of
the municipality, which the charter de
mands :
G. E. Sussdorft, salary, $2400; Thomat D.
Maher, $1600: Beatrice Hinkie. $1200; A. P.

$1200; Z. T. Malaby, $1200; H. O. von der Leith,
$1200.
â¢ Charles H. Murphy, chairman of the
teachers' executive committee, requested,
the board to give the teachers a heuring
upon the compilation of the budget apper
taining to the unpaid salary claims for
November and December, 1898. The board
adjourned to meet to-night to consider
the budget.
D'Ancona's ordinance providing for the
vacation of unsanitary buildings in China
town and their abatement as nuisances
was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
He submitted a partial list of houses
which the health authorities claim should
be destroyed in whole or in part on Dun
combe alley, Washington alley, Pacific
street, Cum Cook alley, HOT to 1117 Stock
ton street, 623 Jackson street, known as
Jackson-street Theater; 612 Jackson

BOARD INDULGES
IN RETALIATION
The ordinance empowering the Mayor to
confer with the Board at Public Works
and the Park Commissioners for the pur
pose of reporting a system of parks and
boulevards was passed to print by the
Board of Supervisors yesterday. The or
dinance was recommended by the Street
Committee In lieu of one introduced toy
Reed providing for the appointment by
the Mayor of a non-salaried Park and
Boulevard Commission.
Reed made a strong plea for the passage
of his bill, but Curtis contended that tha
creation of a new commission is unwise
and that the matter of new parks and
boulevards should rest with the park and
works boards. - McCarthy thought the last
named board should be eliminated and the
work be done by the Park Commission
alone. The substitute measure received
ten votes. .
The ordinance limiting the height of fire
proof buildings to 145 feet on streets more
than 100 feet in width and to 120 feet on
streets less than 100 feet in width, and of
non-fireproof buildings to 110 feet In
height, was defeated. D'Ancona moved to
make the highest limit 125 feet, but his
motion was lost, as was Connor's to fix
It at 135 feet. As the members were un
able to agree the present ordinance, mak
ing the limit 125 feet and eighty feet, is In
effect. Brandensteln gave notice of re
consideration.
The ordinance providing for the manner
in which bail moneys shall be withdrawn
from the city treasury was finally passed.
The bill makes the Auditor's signature a
necessary factor on the demand before it
can be paid. As the Auditor has been ad
vised by his attorney that he has nothing
to do with the demands and the City At
torney holds otherwise mandamus pro
ceedings will be invoked.
The resolution directing the City Attor
ney to assume charge of cases now pend
ing in the Superior Court for the recovery
of back license taxes. on the nickel tele
phone machines belonging to the Pacific
States Company was adopted.'
The Spring Valley Water Works was
directed to comply with an ordinance re
quiring; It to lay eight-Inch mains In cer
tain streets in the University Mound dis
trict.
Bids for Lighting.
The bids for lighting: public buildings
were opened and referred to the Light*
Committee. They showed a reduction of
35. per cent in gas rates and 25 per cent tn
electric light rates compared with last
year. The Pacific Gas Improvement Com
pany bid 88 cents per 1000 cubic feet for
gas, and the Independent Electric Light
and Power Company 29 cents per 1000
watt hours for electric lights, they being
the lowest bidders. Last year's rates
were, respectively. $1 85 and 39.5 cents.
The Water Committee filed a delayed
report recommending the indefinite post
ponement of Reed's bill fixing: the. water
lates for the next fiscal year, thej rates
having been already fixed by ordinance.
The ordinance making it a misdemeanor
to defraud a hack driver of his legal fare
was finally passed.
The Board of Worka was authorized to
advertise for proposals for the keeping In
repair of bituminous^ rock pavements, but
the work must be done in a manner sim
ilar to that in which it Is done under the
existing contract.
Braunhart's ordinance requiring street
railway i companies to provide suitable
fenders and brakes on their cars was re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee.

TTJUTDS FOR UNCOMPLETED
CONTRACTS ARE INVIOLATE
Attorney Lloyd Advisss Auditor Re
garding Payment for Construct
ing Trocadero Gulch.
Aurtltcr Wells wajÂ« advised by his at
torney. Reuben H. Lloyd, yesterday that
the funds appropriated* for the construc
tion of Trocadero Gulch may be carried
over into the next fiscal year, although
the contract for the work will not
completed this fiscal year. Lloyd holds
that no contracts could be awarded
toward the end of one fiscal year if the
funds therefor were transferred to the
surplus fund on account of non-comple
tion of the contract.
The contract for Trocadero Gulch has
been certified by the Auditor and the
contractors are advised to secure an ex
tension of time from the Supervisors and
the money will be held inviolate by the
Auditor to pay for the work, when it is
completed. The opinion is important, as
contractors on other work, which will
remain uncompleted this fiscal year, were
uneasy as to the disposition of the funds
for their payment.

THE Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's Walla Walla had a narrow
escape from going ashore on her
last trip. Had it not been for the
care and skill of Captain Andrew
Hail the chances are that the big vessel
would have been beached a mile north of
Point Reyes, a spot that is 'the grave
yard of many a stout ship.
When the Walla Walla left Victoria,
B. C, for San Francisco she had about
200 passengers aboard. As soon as Flat
tery was passed the fog settled down and
from that time on the vessel had to be
run by dead reckoning, as the sun was
never seen. When Captain Hall figured
that he was off Cape Blanco the lead was
constantly in use until that point was
reached and passed. The same plan was
followed at Cape Mendocino and Point
Arena.
Early on Sunday morning the Point
Reyes whistle was heard but almost, im
mediately the sound died out. . All hands
waited for the next warning note and
when it did not come Captain Hall or
dered the ship slowed down and the lead
cast. The latter showed twenty-nine
fathoms of water, but nevertheless the
vessel was stopped. In a few minutes the
fog lifted and then settled down again
thicker than ever. That moment was
enough, however, as it showed the heavy
surf breaking on the beach half a milo
away. The <-nginen were at once ordered
full npet'd astern and the helm hard over.
The Walla Walla was soon on her course
and four minutes later the Point Reyes
whistle wan once more abeam.
In tho place in which Captain Hall
found himself when the fog lifted the
Point Royes whistle cannot bo heard. It
1Â« a spot in which many a good ship has
left her bones. An English bark laden
with railroad iron went to pieces there,
the bark Otago went on the beach and
never came off. The schooner Rachel loft
her bones there and the Point Arena wont
on the reef but was got off.
After the Walla Walla had backed out
from the beach and was holding her
course along the shore one of the llshlng

SHIPWRECKED SAILORS HOME.
Tour Men From Burned Ship B. D.
/ Rice Back From Japan.
Among the Walla Walla's passengers
were four sailors from the American ship
R. D. Rice, which was burned In Kobe

Canadian Pacific steamships by the Am
erican Consul. E. Tilman, H. Fresher, E.
Nilsson and B. Bertelsen elected to come
to San Francisco, but the remainder of
the crew went to Eastern point. They say
say that the court of inquiry held that
the burning of the vessel was accidental.
M. S. McDevitt, another passenger of
the Walla Walla, had to be removed to
the Harbor Hospital as soon as the vessel
docked. He had been drinking more or
less all the way down and yesterday
morning he wound up with a wild de
bauch. He could not get any liquor from
the steward so he sent his room-mate to
buy a bottle of Scotch. This he secured
and retiring to his stateroom drank every
drop of the liquor In less than fifteen
minutes. It took four policemen to carry
him to the patrol wagon. He is a drum
mer for R. E. Mullane & Co: of Cincin

of them got to work all danger was over
in a few minutes. There was no alarm

Politicians Believe That
Phelan Wants to
Run Again.
Several Well-Known Citizens
Are Considered by the '
Republicans.
Citizen* who take an Interest in mu
nicipal affairs are beginning to discuss
the probable chances of several aspirants
for Mayor of San Franciaco. It is the
judgment of politicians who are usually
â¢well posted that Mayor Phelan will be the
candidate of the Democrats for re-elec
tion. His unpopularity with the voters
comprising the political party to which he
belongs is deep and widespread, but poli
ticians take "into account the fact that he
is rich and does not hesitate to spend
money to gratify his own ambitions. It is
also considered that he is In power and
will not hesitate to employ the patronage
at his command to serve his political ends.
The civil service barriers of the new char
ter present but few obstacles to the mis
use of municipal patronage. Phelan's
candidacy for another term as Mayor will
be brought about if the Republican busi
ness men can again b,e worked in his be
half, and it is no secret among the friends
of the Mayor that be is counting on Xte
jiublka.ii support to overcome the objec
tion of Democratic voters.
Elect Delegates in August.
The election of delecates to the nom
inating; convention wil; take i>l:iee In Au
gust next. County Committee meetings
will be held cany in June to begin tne
active work of Assembly district organi
zation, lit-publicans are already at work
in this direction, l^ast week the Forty
first District Central Kepublican Club re
cltcled Horace Davis president and elect
ed Colonel John C. Currier iirst vice presi
dent. An executive committee of well
known useful citizens will be appointed
til is week.
Itcpubllcans are discussing the merits
of men spoken of as probable candidates
before the convention for Mayor. Charles
ft. ration, who ran against Phelan In 1S9S,
hai> the support of many active Republi
cans. Auditor Asa 1L Wells is regarded
as a strong and available man. The gos
s=:p gees that George A. Newhall would be
jjlras-ed to serve his fellow citizens In the
ofhee of Mayor, and there is talk that he
would do well in that place. James Mc-
Nab'p name Is said to be on the list of the
available, an<l it is a known fact that he
is energetic and can command the support
of influential friends. E>r. Perrault's name
is often mentioned, and the record ot his
service in the Board of Supervisors is re
called to prove that he has the ability to
serve the public.
Dodge and the Governorship.
Assessor Washington Dodge is the Dem
ocratic idol of the day in San Francisco.
All along the line he is spoken of as the
next Democratic nominee for Governor of
California. In the Iroquois Club Dodge
.â¢ippears to have a strong following. The
fact that he has some patronage to be
stow, as he holds the office of Assessor
for two years more, may account for the
sentiments of respect entertained for him.
by local statesmen. It is the talk that he
is stronger in the south than either Mayor
Snyder of Ix>s Angeles or Senator Sims
of Sonoma- The plea is advanced that
the name Washington Dodge is better
pounding and more acceptable to the or
ange grove population than the name Ma
puire ever could be, and far more pleasing
to the newcomers than the name Snyder.
The Democrats seem to take it for grant
ed that the Republicans have decided to
renomlnate Henry T. Gage.

Santa Clara Valley's Wine Yield Will
Be But Kalf That of Last
Year.
SAN JOSE. May 27.â Conservative esti
mates made this morning by local wineries
give the yield of wine for Santa Clara
Valley this season at 1.500,000 gallons. The
yield last year was given at about 3,000,000
gallons.
Last season the price of grapes varied
from $17 to $19, and in few cases were
tests for sugar made, so anxious were
the wineries to get stock. The test this
year Is going to be of still lees import
ance owing to the abnormal shortage.
Wineries bought grapes last year with 19
per cent of sugar, as against the required
22 per cent at market prices. They are
going to pay $23 a ton thi* year, it is said,
and ask no questions.

ity Dr. Moffat announced that la view or
the divergency of opinion he would to
day offer an amendment which he hoped
would meet the approval of the entire as
sembly. When he presented this amend
ment to-day It was Instantly accepted by

tho report as a whole followed with little
delay.
A viva voce vote was taken and when

their Christian spirit and American spirit.

Charles Field's C'95) poems, termine him
"Stanford's first poet."

STANTTORX) UNIVERSITY, May 27.â
The members of the graduating class cele
brated class day with fitting exercises
this morning. At half-past 10 the univer
sity chapel was crowded to the doors by
the members. of the class, undergraduates
and visitors. .President W. MJ Parkin
made the address for the class and in
wcJJ.-chosen words conveyed the gratitude
of Its members to the founders and .fac
ulty of tho university. Dr. Angell; re
sponded on. behalf of the university.
yesterday afternoon on the Great North
ern Railway fo/Jr miles east of Skyomish,
the circumstances of which will make the
imall number of casualties almost miracu
lous. A car loaded with a ton and a half
of dynamite was being run to a siding
when a west-bound freight train, John
Mr-Grouty engineer and Henry Berry
conductor, came along. The men having
the dynamite car In charge attempted to
put it on the siding before the freight
train reached them. They were too late,
however, and fled for their lives.
The engineer reversed his engine and
made every effort to stop the train, but
seeing this was Impossible and knowing
the contents of the dynamite car both ho
and the lireman started to jump from the
cab. The fireman was well out of danger
and Engineer McGrouty was crawling
over the rear ol' the tender when the en
gine struck the dynamite car, and there
was a terrific explosion. â¢
The engine was separated from the
trucks and hurled some distance up the
mouhtain side. Thirteen freight cars were
demolished and about 800 feet of track
torn up. A eteam shovel standing near
was reduced to scraplron.
Engineer John McGrouty was the only
one seriously injured. He received a scalp
wound, his tongue was bitten almost in
two and he was injured about the spine.
He was taken to the Everett hospital.
A watchman's cabin fifty yards from the
scene of the explosion was blown to
pieces and the watchman, who was inside
Â«t the time, was stunned and dazed. The
engine and caboose bringing In the in
jured men made the trip from Monroe to
Bnohomish, a distance of seven miles, in
exactly seven minutes.
After the explosion the railroad authori
ties sent at once to Spokane for a wreck-
Ing train to clear away the debris.
Freight and passenger traffic was delayed
many hours. The west-bound overland,
due in Everett at 6:30 o'clock last even-
Ing, did not arrive until nearly noon to
day.
Railroad officials blame the men having
the dynamite car in charge for the acci
dent.

nate, was to-day threatened wtlh attach
ment proceedings. In fact, the matter had
gono bo far that the writ was actually is
sued and in the possession of Jules Gam
age, a collector of San Francisco, .who
camÂ© on one of the afternoon trains to
levy upon the horses of Pullman. How
ever, the affair was arranged amicably
before he left Redwood City."* ..â¢-Â¦â¢
The difficulty arose out of a life insur
ance policy which Mr. Pullman was per
suaded to take out in the Mutual Life,
but which ho never obtained, .and for
which -ho had given his note in payment.
According to Mr. Pullman's statement, a
man named Morgan Smith on April 23 last
persuaded him to have his life Insured,
the premium on the policy amounting to
$300. On that day he gave his note for the
amount, payable in thirty days. The note
became due, but the policy was not forth
coming.- After the note had been executed
it was transferred, coming into the hands
of Gamage. Mr. Pullman refused to pay
it for the reason that he had not got value
received.
Mr. Pullman is occupying the Hopkins
mansion at the outskirts of this city, hav
ing moved here with a large retinue of
servants about' a month ago. Ho has
leased tho premises for six months and 13
entertaining in a lavish manner. He has
signified his intention of buying the Hop
kins place if he be satisfied with it.
BRICKLAYERS' LOCKOUT '
7 IS NOW DECLARED OFF
The Men Arrive at "a Satisfactory
Settlement With the Mason â¢
Builders' Association.
NEW YORK, May 28.â Tho joint arbi
tration board of the Bricklayers' .Union

ing. It was then announced that all dif
ferences had been settled and that the
lockout and strike had been mutually de
clared off. - The men will return to work
this morning. From June 28 the men will
receive 60 cents an hour instead of 55
cents, as heretofore. This rate of wages
will ho!d good until'May 1. 1902. At the
conference it was decided that all differ
ences between the bricklayers and the
mason builders shall be referred to the

The settlement of the strike, which has
been in force for about two weeks, will

are substantially the demands made by
the 1 machinists.
Sampson Has Not Resigned.
BOSTON, May 27.â Lieutenant Bennett,
aid to Admiral Sampson, commandant of
the Charleston navy yard, stated to-day
that the report to the effect that the ad

He added that the admiral was enjoying
very good health at present. Lieutenant
Bennett said: 'â¢Â¦â¢Â»- Â¦â¢--..'
"The fact that he retires next February
makes the story all the more preposter

When thereto a natural and healthy circulation of the .blood, the entire
quantity, estimated at one-eighth the weight of the body,' passes through the heart
every five minutes. This rapid flow of the blood through the system prevents the
entrance of disease germs and impurities of every description. It filters out all that
is not necessary or good for the growth and' development of the body and nourish-
ing and strengthening the muscles, tissues, nerves and bones. . But, unfortunately,
few persons can rightly, claim an absolutely pure blood supply and perfect and'
unpolluted circulation, and in consequence are exposed to innumerable diseases.'

evidence some constitutional or blood trouble, which salves, lotions, powders, nor
any external treatment can cure. Diseases that originate in the blood, whether
they manifest themselves as ulcers* tumors, itching eruptions, muscular or -bone
pains, require a tonic and blood purifier such as S. S. S., which not only~ antidotes
and neutralizes blood poisons and humors, but possesses health-giving tonic proper-

/Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C.;May 27.-The United
States revenufl cutter U.S. Grant haa
been flpated. She was lifted off the rocks
in Enanich Inlet yesterday afternoon and
taken in tow by the cutter Perry and the
tug Mystery. She was hauled out this
afternoon on the ways ' here for repairs.
Her injuries are confined to her hull, but,
there, being a number of holes, many new
plates will be placed in her.
On the arrival of the Grant here to-day
it waa learned that it was due to the de
sire on the part of Captain Tozier to add
to his collection of Indian curios that the
Grant went into Saanlch Inlet, a body of
water seldom freauented and not more
than fifteen miles from Victoria. There Is
a deserted village of the Malahath Indians
there, and a few days before the ' Grant
started on her cruise word waa sent to
an officer of one of the ships at Esqui
mau, a collector â¢ of Indian totems and
other curios, that there was a fine collec
tion at the Malahath village for sale. * I
Captain Tozier Jearned of this- and when
the Grant, left here she proceeded to Saa
nich Inlet, where Captain Tozier hoped to
procure the collection. "Unfortunately,
the Grant - ran upon the rocks which lie
opposite the village and was almost lost.
Had she slipped but five feet farther for
ward she would have glided - right over
the rock and foundered. She was lifted
from the rock at high tide on Saturday

CUTTER GRANT
OFF THE REEF
York. The decision was rendered on be
half of the majority of the court by Jus
tice-Brown,' tho opinion being: concurred
in by all the Justices except Justices Me-
Kenna,. Shiras and White. The decision
hung upon the case coming from the
State of New York, Involving the levying
of $13,000 in duties on goods imported Irom
Porto Rico into the United States, the
collection having been sustained by the
Â¦lower court. In effect the decision vas
that territory acquired by : the United
States is a part of the; United States and
not foreign territory and that such import
duties could not be levied. ;Thp decision
of the lower court was reversed. â¢
Justice Brown announced in the beRin
ning of his decision that tho court un
doubtedly has Jurisdiction in this case. He
said the case raised the single question
whether territory acquired by the United
States by cession from a foreljrn power
remained a. "foreign country" within the
meaning: of tiro tariff laws, and added:
The queBtlon involved in this case is not
whether the sugars were Importable articles
under the tariff laws, but whether, coming ai
they .Jiii, from a port alleged to be domentic,
they w*re Imported from a foreign countryâ In
other wordÂ», whether they were imported iÂ»t

Status of Porto Bico.
"The Btatus of Porto Rico was thlli: The
island had been for some months under
military occupation by the United States
as a conquered country, when, by the t>ec
ond article of the treaty of peaoÂ» between
the United States and Spain, Piened 1ir->
cemEer 10, 1808, and ratified April 11, 1899.
Spain ceded to the United States the
island of Porto Rico, which has ever since
remained in our possession and nas been
governed and administered by us. If the
case depended solely upon those facts and
the question were hxoadly held whether a
country which had been ceded to us, the
cession accepted, possession delivered "anil
the Island occupied s and administered,
without interference by Spain or any
other power, was a foreign country or do
mestic territory, it.woul^ seem that there
could be as little hesitation : in answertnR
this question as there wÂ»uld-be in deter
mining the ownership of a house deeded
in fee simple to a purchaser who had ac
cepted the deed, gone into possession, paid
taxes and made improvements without let
or hindrance from his vendor. But It is
earnestly insisted by the Government that
it never could have been the intention of
Congress to admit Porto Rico into a cus
toms union with the United States.. and
that, while the island may be to a certain
extent domestic territory, it still remains
a 'foreign country' under the tariff laws
until Consrress has embraced it within the
general revenue system."
At great length the court then discussed
similar Cases arising from previous ac
quisitions of territory by ,the United
States, reviewing very fully former de
cisions of the court involving cases such
as are presented in this case. The pos
sessions ' in connection with which the
main auestion involved in thl3 'case^haa
arisen are Louisiana, Florida, Texas, Cal
ifornia and Alaska, Each case was taken
up in order and, analyzed minutely.
As to Foreign Countries.
The court then presented Its conclusions
in the following language:
" As showing- the construction put upon this
question by the legislative department, we
need only to add that section 232 of the For
aker act makes a distinction between foreign
countries and . Porto Rico, by enacting that
the same, duties shall be paid . upon . Vail, ar
ticles imported into Porto Rico from ports
other than "those of the United States, which
are required by law to be collected upon ar
ticles imported into the United States from
foreign countries." â¢ .
From this resume of the decisions of this
court the instructions of the executive depart
ments \ and the above act of Congress, .it is
evident that, from 1803, the date of Mr. Gal
latin's letter, to this present time, there is
not' a shred of authority, except the dictum
in Fleming- vs. Page, for holding- that a dis
trict ceded to and In the possession of the
United States remains for any purpose a for
eign country. Both these conditions must ex
ist to produce a change of nationality for rev
enue purposes. Possession Is not alone suf
ficient, as was held in Fleming vs. .Page, nor
is a treaty ceding- such territory sufficient
â¢without a surrender of possession. Tne prac
tice of the executive departments, thus con
tinued for more than half a century, is en
titled to srreat weight and should not be dis
regarded nor overturned except for cogent rea
sons and unlees it be clear that such con
struction' be erroneous. .
If this were placed as an original question we
should . be compelled Irresistibly to the same
conclusion. By article XI of section 2 the
President is given power "by and with .the
advice and consent of the Senate, to make
treaties, provided that. two-thirds of the Sena
tors present concur.", and by article VI. "this
constitution and the laws of the United States
which sh3ll be made in pursuance thereof, and
all treaties Â¦ made â¢ or which shall be made,
under the authority of the United States shall
be-the supreme lawof the land." â¢ ,,V
It will be observed that no distinction Ms
marie as to the question of supremacy between
laws, and treaties, except that both are con
trolled by the constitution. A law requires the
assent of both houses of Congress; and, ex
cept in certain specified cases, the signature
of the President. A treaty Is negotiated and
made by the President, with the concurrence
of two-thirds of the Senators present, .but eacii
of them is> the supreme law of the land. Â¦ I
As if by Annexation.
One of the ordinary incidents, of a treaty Is
the cession of territory. It is not too nfuch to
say it is the rule, rather than Â¦ the exception,
that a. treaty of. peace, following upon a war,
provide for a cession of territory to the victo
rious party. The territory thus acquired Is ac
quired as absolutely as if the annexation were
made as In the case of ,. Texas and Hawaii by
an act of Congress.
It follows from this that by ratification of the
treaty of Paris the island became territory of
the United States â although not an- organized
Territory in the technical sense of the word.
.It Is true Chief Justice Taney held, In Scott
vs. Sandford that the territorial clause of the
constitution was confined and then tended to be
confined to the territory which at that time
belonged to or was claimed by the United States
and was within their boundaries, as settled by
that treaty. with Great Britain and waa not in
tended to apply to territory, subsequently, ac
quired. He seemed to (lifter in this construc
tion from Chief Justice Marshall who. In speak
ing of Florida before it became a State, re
marked that It continued to be a Territory of.
the United States, governed by the territorial
oLnuse of the constitution. ' . â¢
, But whatever be the source of this power its
uninterrupted exercise by CongTess for a cen
tury and the repeated declarations of this court
have settled the law that the right to acquire
territory involves the right to govern and dis
pose of it. Indeed, it it, scarcely too mschto
say that thero has not been a session of Con
gress since the Territory of Louisiana was pur
chased that that body has not enacted legisla
tion based upon the assumed authority to kov
er nand control the territories. It is an author
ity which arises not necessarily from the ter
ritorial clause., of the ; constitution, but from
the necpEB6ltiÂ«s of the case and from the Inabil
ity of the States -to act upon the subject. Under
this power Congress may deal : with territory

Territory thus acquired can remain a foreign
country under the tariff laws only upon one o(
two theories: Either that the word "foreign"
applieR to such countries as were foreign at tho
time theistatute was enacted, notwithstanding
any subsequent Â¦ change In their condition; or
that they remain foreign under the tariff laws
until Congress â¢ has formally embraced them
within the customs union of the States. The
first theory Is obvlouoly untenable. While at
statute Is presumed. to speak from the time of
Its enactment. It embraces all such persons or
things as subsequently fall within Its scope.
Thus,' a statute forblddir.fr the sale of liquors

to oil who are subsequently born, and ceases to
apply to such as thereafter reach their major

States declares In article I section 10 that the
Htntes shall not do certain things, this declara

Lower Court Is Reversed.
A, slnele further point remains to be con
sidered* 1 Â¦ . Â¦ ' Â¦ - â¢ Â¦-"Â« 'Â¦Â¦Â¦
It is insisted that an act of Congress passed
March 24, v - 19Q0 (SUfitat. .151). applying fcr the
'benefit of Porto = Rico' the amount of customs,
revtmue' received on importations by the United
States from Porto Rico since the evacuation
of Potto Rico by Spanish force* October 18.
1S98, to January 1, 1800,' together with any-fur
ther customs revenue)! ' collected on, importa
tions from Porto Rico since January 1, 1900.
or shall hereafter be under existing
law, is "a recognition by Congress of the riffht
to collect . such duties as upon importations
from a foreign country, and a recognition of
the fact that Porto Rico continued to be a
foreign country until Congress .embraced it
within customs union. . It may be seriously
questioned whether this Is anything more than
a recoenitlon of the fact, that there were
moneys !n the territory not subject tÂ« exist
ing appropriation law. Perhaps we may go
further and say that so far as those duties
were r>ald.\ voluntarily and without protest,
the legftlity of the payment was intended. to be
recognized, but it can clearly have no retro
active effect as to moneys thereafter paid un
der protest for which an action to recover
back has already been brought. As this ac
tion in this case was brought March 13. 1900.
eleven days before the act was passed, the
right to recover the money sued for could not
be taken away by any- subsequent" act of Con
grefs. Plaintiff suea'in assumosit for money
which the collector has in his hands, justly
and equitably belonging to them. To say that
Congress could by a subsequent act deprive
them of tho right to prosscute this action
would be. beyond Its powers. .In any event,
it should not be interpreted so as to make it
REVERSE JUDGMENTS
OF THE COURT BELOW
We are, therefore, of the opinion that at the
time these duties were levied Porto Rico
was not a foreign country within the meaning
of the tariff laws; . but a Territory of. the
United States: that the duties were illegally
exacted and that the plaintiffs are entitled to
recover them back.
The juds-ment of the Circuit Court for the
Southern District of New York is, therefore, re
versed and tho case remanded to that court for
further proceedings in consonance with ' this
opinion. 'Â¦ T - *
NEW YORK, May 27.â Frederick R.
Coudert Jr., who argued the cases of De
Lima "and Downes before the Supreme
Court, said: â¢ - - v
"This De Lima decision affects only the
duties collected on Porto Rican products
previous .to the passage of the Foraker
act. We have covered the auestion of
duties collected since the passage of that
act by 'what is called the Downes case.
This Is an issue which we created to test
the constitutionality of the law."
â¢ Speaking of the De Lima decision Mr.
Coudert said:
. "This case, I think I can say, is a his
tory making decision. It will have a bear
ing upon the position not only of Porto
Rico but of the Philippines and Hawaii as
well. It practically means that.this.Gov
ernment can have no such thine as col
onies in the sense that Great Britain has
them. ' Every inch of territory over which
the "nag;" floats must hereafter be consid
ered an integral part of the Union."
- Charles' .Frederick -Adams; or the' law
firm Of Coudert Bros., who prepared tne
case of De Lima, said: \
â¢-"If the court says the Foraker act Is
.right, then the constitutional question is
against us, "for. Congress has the power to
discriminate against ceded countries. In
that act a duty of 15 per cent of the Ding
ley tax was regarded .as legal on -goods
shipped from Porto Rico; but in the case
of Downes,it was brought up as a test
caee,' their duty being levied after -the
passage of the Foraker act." r %â¢
Naturally, members of tho firm 'of D.
A. de lima were flated by the decisions.
Said Mr. de Lima:
fOiir contention that Porto Rico sug-ar
was American sugar, and therefore not
dutiable,* has been sustained." â¢
Â¦ Another member of the firm said: ; :
"\V"e are much gTatifledto learn that a
great national "Question has flnally_ been
settled. Bince Porto Rico came under the
American flag the firm has paid under
protest duties amounting to a large sum,
which.. we understand, under the Supreme
Court's ruling, will have to be refunded."
W. J. Bryan's Opinion.
LINCOLN, Neb, May 27.â W. J. Bryan's
only opinion on the decision In the insular
cases was that it upheld the contention of
the Republicans in some respects and that
of the Democrats in â¢ others. Â¦; He said he
would not commit^himself further on, the
effect of the opinion until he had read the

~1(NEW~THE WAY OUT. .
Made a Study of His Food.
It Is not always that the user of food
understands about that food, but a gentle-
man in Cincinnati writing about Grape-
Nutf expresses himself perfectly. Ha
says; "A business man devoting himself
to hard, mental labor, requires different
focd than a man doing muscular work. I
became aware of a dull, heavy feeling in
my head day by day. which did an un-
told damage to my work. Verdict, In-
testinal Indigestion; punishment, a severe
diet list, leaving out starchy foods, sugar
and fat.
"Up to this time, with the most precise
care In cooking, the ordinary breakfast
food tame to the table a pasty, starchy
mass. Added to that was sugar and
more or less white bread, which gave an
excess cf starchy food that could not be
digested. This Indigested mass passed
into the intestines, creating gas and all of
ihe distressing symptoms both of body
and brain.
"I was put on Grape-Nuts Food for the
reason that it is made of selected parts of
wheat and barley, thoroughly cooked -at
the factory, giving to the body the
starchy part of the food (which Is neces-
sary), predigested. that is, turned into
dextrose or grape sugar. This furnished
the sweet needed, without the use of cane
sugar, and gave me the starchy ' principle
of food already passed Into the second
condition, exactly in the same manner as
a healthy body digests It.
"After eatiQg Grape-Nuts for. a short
time I found a most remarkable improve-
ment in my health, and I also discovered
the reason why the claim made on the
package is true, that one pound of Grape-
Nuts, which is perfectly absorbed by the
body, will afford fkore nutrition than ten
pounds of meat, wheat or bread, imper-
fectly digested. I can assure any . one
that a week or ten days' conscientious
use of Grape-Nuts will prove far more
convincing testimony than . any written
words. I subscribe myself a gratefulcon-
Bumer. Please do not publish my name."

OLD DOCTOR
Â¦y ;, This Is a Story With a Moral.
Once a young man met a wise old, doctor. The doctor was rich,
as doctors often get to be. The young man was poor,' as young men
often are; but he had studied hard arid had invented an' electric belt
which he thought was better than anything else in the world as a strength-
builder. He hoped some day to prove its value.
And .then he hoped to be as rich as the wise old doctor.
' The wise old doctor and the young man had known each other as
fellow-travelers for two whole days, and they were rather inclined to be
sociable, as fellow-travelers often are. ..
"1 would like to ask you, Doctor," said the young man, "why- it 13
that doctors as a rule are so bitter against my electric belt; why you
always condemn it, and discourage your* patients from using it^ Do you
mind giving me an honest answer to that question?"
."Why, my. dear boy," said the wise old doctor with, a fatherly smile, .
"that is a ridiculous question. Let us suppose that you and I ' owned
grocery stores on opposite corners; that I had a. good customer whom I
wished to keep, and that he asked me if I thought you sold better gro-
ceries than I .did, and at ?ower prices, do you think I would tell him you
did and advise him to trade with you?. No, my son; you don't think me
such a fool; v
"Doctors,: my boy, are doctors because it brings them a living, and
they are not going to lose'aigood customer if they can help it."
Â¦": 'Â¦Â¦"â¢ "But," .ventured the young man, "do you not know that my plan of

years of careful) study I should know how it ought to be applied?
Based on its actual -merit, ought not the doctors to recommend it for the
good of humanity?" ...
"Yes, yes, yes.- I concede all that, my son, but you forget that if we
acknowledge all* this to our patients we would be taking the bread out
of our. own mouths, and that we are not willing to do. I know of two
cases of my ; o\vn' patients who have used your" belt, and they have
spoken very highly of it; but you don't get any more of my patients if I
can help it." ' -
So said the wise old doctor,. and the young man agreed that he wa3

NEW YORK. May 27.â To-day's business in
the stock market, was the smallest for any
full d2>- since the Presidential election. There
was nothing in the market to indicate any out
pide interest, either speculative or investment.
The bond market â¢ shared in the dullness. In
the general run of stocks professional traders
made iutile attempts to force a movement of
prices, but in covering their contracts the
movement was undone. There was a slight
hardening of prices early In sympathy with
the movement in Tobaccos, followed by a period
of weakness. There was a general hardening
again bstore the close. Recoveries were not
complete in the general list and losses are the
iule in stocks that were traded in. The move
ment tii tobacco stocks was the only thing
â¢worthy of special notice in the day's trading.
It was unexplained and the movement came
to a halt, caused by some reaction on the first
announcement of the Supreme Court's decision
in the Porto Rican cases. Continental Tobacco,
however, held stubbornly and rose to the high
est in the dealings, closing 5% points over Sat
urday. American Tobacco's net gain was 3%.
The weakness in Sugar was perhaps the effect
of the decision, although the troubles with the
importers of refined sugar have affected the
F'ock. Lackawanna moved up a clear 8
points after an opening reaction on light tran
sactions and without explanation. Amalga
mated Copper was under some pressure and
fell at one time 2%. Late in the day there were
two transactions of 100 shares each In Northern
Pacific at 160. compared with 200 en Saturday.
The failure to relax the close holding of this
ptock on the part of any of the interests con
cerned keeps alive apprehension respecting the
Northern Pacific situation. Although the for
eign markets were all closed to-day there was
a good demand for exchange from arbitrage
housee. said to be in preparation for the Stock
Exchange in London the latter part of the
week. The continued demand for exchange
from these sources attracts increasing atten
tion to the heavy return of American securi
ties to the home market. The money market
t-hoTred increasing ease and it is the general
expectation that further gold will go out to
France this week.
There was a small business in bonds/ with
an irregular movement of prices. Total sales,
par value. $2,200,000.

Ealmonâ The position is unchanged, actual
values here being somewhat above those being
accepted at Liverpool, where some holders of
Fraser River ealmon are accepting reduced
prices, especially for lialf-pound flats, which
are in srood supply. The Machrihanish has ar
' rived at Liverpool with CS.098 cases of Fraser
River salmon. Alaska, salmon moves off quiet
ly, prices being without alteration. Fruitsâ The
uncertainty still prevailing as to the amount
of the duty to be charged on California fruits
continues to hinder business, and a settlement
of the question is anxiously awaited. The con
tentiuns of the customs officials that canned
apricots ehould be classed as '"dried" apricots
can t-carcely be put forward seriously, and
certainly appears absurd. Pines are firm, both
on ihe ppot and for forward delivery, and con
tinue to meet a brisk demand. Liverpool fruit
ti a-io. while net so active as last week, still
continues good. Aprieote are in demand. The
edvires for March and April shipments of pine
Â¦jgdffl from Singapore go to show that there
nay be' a squeeze here in that article during
the next two or three weeks. .

CHICAGO, May 27.â July wheat opened un
changed to a shade lower at 72"d@73e. In
duced by reports of damage by .insects, an
advance developed, and within half~an hour
after the opening July sold at 73%c. The buoy
ancy of the situation was accentuated by fa*
vorable figures on the visible supply and a de
crease in the quantity on passage. During the
forenoon the bull leader in corn, who had
been a seller of July wheat, became a buyer,
carrying a following with him, and the price
rose to 73%c, after which under profit-taking it
reacted to 73%c. The close was steady, July
%c higher at 73%c.
The activity in the corn pit was only a
shade less marked than that exhibited, in
wheat. It opened unchanged to a shade lower,
but recovered under" the strength in wheat.
July closed steady, %c higher, at 43%c.
Oats were active and Improved . at the open T
inar, but later developed dullness. July oats
closed steady at %@Vic higher at 28%@28%c. .

Madame "Wu's Observations.
The wife of the Chinese Minister, in an
article in Success, says that while she
was living in England she was often sur
prised at the ways of English eirls, but
when she came to America she,found that
the girls here enjoyed a still greater free
dom and she believes that lt may have
good results. In China the girls are pre
vented from having any knowledge of the
world until they are married, and for this
reason they are always helpless and thor
oughly dependent. Even after marriage
they learn but little of real life unless
they are very poor and are oblised -to
work hard, whereas American girls seem
always to.be able to take care of them
selves. Mme. Wu observes that she is
more and more astonished â¢ every day at
the thing3 American girls are able to do,
as there Is hardly any profession which
they do not follow and that often they
are more successful than men.â St. Louis

which is located across the street from
Baurjohn'js stand. / .,
The grocer marched his captive to the
jail at the point of his revolver. The de

or his business. As Bourjohn had no
charg-es to prefer, the jailers made no at
tempt to hold the prisoner. After his re
lease from the jail he left the neighbor

"Clarice" is a sparkling- little comedy
with many taking- situations. The com
plications are introduced by Captain
Racket's bold mendacity, which "finally
leads to his undoing. In order to fore
stall his Uncle Obadiah's matrimonial de-
tain is led to believe that his wife has
really been 'out to a champagne supper
with another man and the revelation is
too much for him. The illustration shows
Clarice carrying out her ruse of a "happy
jag," while the rest of the company at
tempts to restrain the husband's fury.
Clarice, thinking the, captain sufficiently
punished, relents and*explanations follow.

OAKLAND, May 27.â The failure of
a pair of Japanese to pay for a
set of pork chops" precipitated an
international riot in Chinatown
last night. The entire population
leaped on the body of one of the Japanese
and so maltreated him that he had to be
taken to a doctor. But for "detachments
from the American, and German eontin
gÂ«tits, who came on the run to the rescue;
the man would have been killed.
Satsuma and Hayatsi entered the Yan
Kee rotisserie, the s"wellest place in Chi
natown, about 7 o'clock in the evening.
Yan Kee himself waited on them. After
consuming the first course of birdsnest
soup they ordered pork chops for two for
the second. The next course was gin, but
by this time the proprietor had made up
his mind that all future orders should be
on a C. O. D. basis and that all arrearages
must be paid quickly. His customers had
been dining, with such heartiness that a
strong suspicion was aroused within his
breast that they were going to "get in on
him" for a large lump of money. Besides
he has a natural antipathy for the race

FAil'lLFXTTj PREACHIN'G # V Â¦-
RECOGNIZED BY COTTRT
Pastor's Account for Subscription to
Sis Salary Allowed Against
Parishioner's Estate.
OAKLAND, May 27.â Because he had
"preached salvation to the best of hi3
ability" to his wealthy parishioner, Mrs.
Charlotte Sahlmann. during 1 her lifetime,
the Rev. C. W. MHnes of Fruitvale is
authorized by Judge Hall to draw $3 50
from her estate.
The matter was up in the Probate Court
to-day for final settlement. Mr. mines,
who is pastor of the Methodist church in
Fruitvale, was named by Mrs. Sahlmann
as her executor. Several items which ha
claimed on his own account were disal
lowed by the court at a former hearing
pending further investigation. Among
these was included one of IS 50, the residue
of a subscription made by the deceased
toward the pastor's salary.
"Never mind it, Judge," said the preach
er;, "if the heirs need it more than I do
let them have it."
"That Isn't the question," answered his
Honor. "Did Mrs. Sahlmann make this
subscription before her death?"
"Yes."
"Well, I have no doubt you fulfilled your
part by preaching salvation to her to tho
best of your ability."
"Let it go, Judge; it won't break ma
nor make them." .
The mob dragged him to the middle of
Eighth street and passed the time away
by taking running jumps and landing on
his face as he lay prostrate. They also
threw basalt paving- rocks at him and
blew police whistles In his ear. The
Chinamen would have kept up the ex
citement until the man was dead had It
rot been for the timely interference of a
man named Gallagher and another man
named Koenig, who were attracted by the
rioting. They helped, him to his feet and
walked with him to his home on Seventh
street, where he was treated by a Jap
anese practitioner. The Jap was hardly
able to stand.
The "chinks" followed the allied forces
down Franklin street, , threatening to
lynch the offender and occasionally hurl
ing onions and bricks. But when they ar
rived at Seventh street they came In sight
of a lot of pickets parading in front of a
colonizing establishment. Hayatsi ha<l
told them what had happened to him and
his Â¦ countrymen prepared. They filled
their pockets with ballast from, the car
tracks and charged. The Boxers retreated
in disorder to their own breastworks, after
making a feeble show of fight. Some
heads were broken and queues hacked, but
that was all.
and didn't care to serve them anyway.
j Madly Hurls the Pork Chops.
Yan Kee bluntly told the diners of. his
conclusions and showed them the rules of
the house. The effect was instantaneous.
Satsuma let fly a plateful of pork chop
bones, at Yan Kee's head. Hayatsi flung
a potted plant in the same direction. Both
gentlemen then moved toward the door.
But egress was barred to the Japs by
the hordes of Chinamen, who came fast
as soon as they heard a noise. Satsuma
got wedged in the doorway and could os
cillate neither way. His friend was being
chased around the restaurant with knives,
forks and cleavers. It looked bad for the
late diners for e while, but finally a great
thought struck Satsuma. He yelled it to
Hayatsi at the top of his lungs. Hayatsi
caught the' idea immediately and began
to throw anything he could lay his hands
on at the windows and crockery. The
rotisserie was coon a sad wreck. Before
he got through Hayatsi had Yan Kee et
al. running in another direction from him.
and in the excitement he made good hl3
escape. /

After Wolf's wrathful exit the trial of
the case went on. Menges had, plenty of
witnesses to testify that they, believed his
wife of unsound mind, and a decree was
given on that ground dissolving the mar
riage. Menges testifying that he did not
know at the time of the tfceddlng that his
wife was Insane. Menges Is a plumber,
living at 821 Center street. His place of
business Is in San Francisco.
Until the misunderstanding in court-to
day the defense has felt confident of easily
winning the suit. Mrs. Menges' father
W. C. Good, who was a party to the suit
as her guardian, was too ill to appear in
court to-day, and a doctor's certificate to
*I> a f, effect was presented by Attorney
Wolf. He had already secured one con
tinuance and the Judge refused to allow
further delay.
Menges brought the suit for annullment
of the marriage on the ground that his
wife is of unsound mind. He said that he
learned of her insanity five weeks after
their marriage, but continued to live with
her for nine" years, during which time sev
eral children were born to the couple
The case lirst came up before Judge
Ellsworth. He declared that the conten
tion of the plaintiff seemed to him, If
granted, to open the way for monstrous
abuse of the meaning of the law allowing
a man to claim the better part of a
woman's life and to discard her when it
suited his pleasure. The case was trans
ferred to Judge Greene's court for con
venience.
Exasperated at the refusal of Judge
Greene to grant him a continuance in the
Menges marriage contest case on account
of the illness of one of his clients, Attor
ney Myron E. Wolf to-day withdrew from
the courtroom, leaving the plaintiff, Adam
F. Menges, to get judgment by default.
Wolf declared he would appeal the case
to the Supreme Court.

High School Students Arrange th3
Celebration of the Close of
the Term. .
OAKLAND, May 27.â The class day
farde of the Oakland High School will be
given June 6. It is "Esmeralda." The
commencement exercises will be held June
7 at 8 o'clock p. m. The graduating class
is as follows: â¢ *
Mr. Wilder is a brother of the late A.
D. Wilder, who was superintendent of the
western division for many years and un
til his death two years. ago. The new as
sistant stands high in' the esteem and
confidence of the division -officials, and
brings to his new post of duty a wide ac
quaintance and complete familiarity with
the intricate details of train operation.
The Southern Pacific Company officials
have decided to restore the position of
resident engineer of the western division,
which was combined with that of assist
ant division superintendent when Mr. Pal
mer was named to succeed the late Joseph
E. Thompson. At that time Mr. Palmer
was resident engineer, but after his ad
vancement the two positions > were, con
solidated. .
By the decision to again separate the
duties of the two posts F. F.- Lloyd, a
clerk in the superintendent's office, will be
advanced, and on June 1 he will be given
the responsible place of resident engineer.
The reasons assigned for the re-creation
of the position are based upon the heavy
increase in traffic and the demand for
more supervision in the operating and
track departments. Much interest has
been taken in speculation concerning Mr.
Palmer's successor here, because the po
sition is deemed by railroad men a very
desirable appointment. This division, be
ing the main line terminal for both
freight and passengers, is the most im
portant on the system, particularly on
account of the added heavy local service
which is handled.
J. C. "Wilder, who- nas: been for years
connected with the superintendent's of
fice on the western division of the South
ern Pacific Company, has been promoted
to be assistant division superintendent
under James â¢ Agler, succeeding W. S.
Palmer, who on June 1 will take charge
of the Sacramento division in place of
Jack Wright, resigned.

Chinese woman, be deported to China.
Tsoy j was found stowed away on the
Prlae of the River, a Stockton boat. She
had no registration paper and was ar
rested for being unlawfully in the- coun

claiming to* be a native of California, ap
peared in court and swore that he mar
ried Sin six months ago. Her counsel
raised the point that being the wife of
an American citizen, the woman could
not- be deported. An appeal will be ta

question has ever been raised.

When the accusation had been written
his strength had not deserted him, and he
did not stop Jn his effort to expose the
guilty party. He dragged himself to an
Wilson -staggered about for a moment
or two and noted the escape of the as-
Eassin. He realized that the act had been
witnessed by no one and the pain was al
ready weakening him. In his turn he ex
perienced a passion for revenge, and not
knowing how soon his lips might be si
lenced he determined that Clancy should
not be gpared the" lash of Justice. With
an effort he made his way to a desk and
with -^a quivering -hand penned tliese
words: . ; .
Patrick Clancy ehot tae.
J. JC. E. WILSON.
Clancy believed that" the attorney had
not served him faithfully and sought him
with a view of securing satisfaction.
They met fape to. face and were: alone. A
few words were spoken and the dis
gruntled client quickly executed his plan
cf revenge. While his victim was beg
g!r.g for mercy he fired two shats, both of
which took effect, then replaced the
smoking revolver in his pocket and went
his way, satisfied that old scores had been
evened up. ..
Sanscme street. After his victim had
felt the sting of two bullets and fallen to
the floor his . slayer coolly walked
away from the scene of the "crime and
surrendered himself to Police Officer J. L.
Nelson on Kearny street. Wilson was
taken to .the Receiving Hospital .and ex
pire-.l on an operating table several hours
later.
At the Receiving hospital the Burgeons
found that -one bullet had passed through
the forearm, then through the biceps of
the" same limb and'into the body. It was
extracted about ten inches below the
Attorney's Dying Statement.
The attorney, after his return, had the
judgment set aside, and according to his
statement demanded costs from his client.
These the latter refused to pay and .the
judgment stood. Clancy claims that he
then paid the attorney a retainer to ap
peal the case, but that Wilson neglected
to do so and started to go to Alaska in
the interest of the South Alaska Packers'
Association. He reached Seattle but came
back to San Francisco. Clancy, having
lost his property, brooded over the matter
and craved satisfaction. He attributed
his loss to the peculiar methods of his
attorney and the outcome of his wrath
was the tragedy of yesterday. The ques
tion of the mortgage is held by the shooter
as a. shady feature of the suit and Clancy
insists that his attorney assisted in a
scheme against him.
Clancy Broods Over Loss of Suit.
adjoining office and made a declaration
of what had happened. - . .
Some months ago Mrs. " Clancy died,
leaving an estate consisting of property
and cash, but no will. A question was
raised by the three sisters of the deceased
regarding the distribution of the prop
erty and Attorney "Wilson was engaged to
protect the husband's interests. The sis
ters- brought suit against Clancy on a
mortgage and secured/Judgment. At the
time the case was heard Wilson was in
Seattle and Clancy did not appear.
In connection with the 1 failure of the
Pacific' Bank he. was sued by the ' State
and judgment obtained for '$4000, which as
Insurance Commissioner he had deposited
in the bank instead: of transmitting at
once to Sacramento, as the law required.
This judgment served as a bar to an in
dictment for embezzlement when his case
was later presented to the Grand Jury. .
In 1893 he was engaged by Dr. West " to
defend him on the charge of murder in
Sued by the State.
On the expiration of his tenure of the
office of Insurance Commissioner he re
sumed the practice of law, but, the best
part of his former clientele "no longer,
sought his services," and soon his practice
was mostly confined to Police Court cases,
and in consequence of a number of ques
tionable transactions he lost all standing
with the reputable members of the pro
fession. â¢-
Wilson was. married in 1877 to a most
estimable woman, by whom he had two
children, both of whom, with their moth
er, are now residing in this city. -
It was while serving his term as Sen
ator that he took the step from which
most people date his downfall. He pro
cured a divorce from the wife of his
young manhood ' and . the mother of his
children and married a woman whom he
had met in Sacramento. â¢ This cost him
many of his best friends and largely com
promised his social standing. He retained
his hold, however, on the political ropes,
and in 1889 was appointed Insurance Com
missioner, by Governor Waterman,, which
position he held for one term. Part of his
strength lay in his affiliations with a num
ber of secret societies, of which, he was
an active member. In. 1890 he was- made
deputy grand master of the Odd Fellows
of California.
J. N. : E. Wilson was about 45 years of
age, having been born in this city, where
his aged parents still reside, in 1856. After
a course In the public schools he entered
the University of California, from which
he graduated with honors in 1876. He then
studied law for two years in- the office of
Judge Mastick, and In 1878 was admitted
to practice- by the Supreme Court of the
State. He was not long in demonstrating
his aptitude for -the legal profession, and
though quite a young man his name was
soon Identified with some of the most im
portant cases, both civil and criminal,,
that have come before the courts of this
city. His success at the bar continued for
some years, until he became involved in
politics. In 1884 he was elected District
Attorney, and on the expiration of j his
term was sent to the ] State Senate for
the session of 1887-89. . . .

At the request of Assistant District At
torney T. I. Fitzpatrick and , after the
reading of his statement Wilson made his
mark in the presence of Detective Tom
Ryan, T. I. Fitzpatrick and Police Officer
John J. -Moriarity. Wilson was so weak
that Fitzpatrick had to hold his hand.
Signs of internal trouble made them
selves manifest- and an operation was de
cided upon. Drs. Malaby, Rixford and
Sartori were in attendance. Shortly after
10 o'clock -the patient was taken from the
table, and in a few. minutes later the doc
tors announced that Wilson had passed
away.
At the hospital Wilson's daughter at
tended him. .She came in response to a
telephone message and almost fainted
when she beheld the . condition of her
the big- office and wrote on a piece of paper,
thinking that I waa going to die right away,
these words: "Patrick Clancy shot me," and
signed my. name. I then rushed to the door,
out Into the hall. and into a printer's office and
there fell down. I had no weapon on me and
made no attempt to injure him in any way. He
took me completely by surprise. This was a
cold-blooded assassination.

Lukherath's statements as to his move

roborated by his friend Smith. Smith
says that he met Lukherath and, after
having several drink*, they walked along
Market street to ; Oak and thence along
Laguna â¢ to their home. Lukherath. he
says, went to bed first. \ It was between

"The * three - of Â¦ us had a -number of
drinks, and It was about 9:30 o'clock when
Smith and I left the saloon. On our way
home Smith stopped in a drug store on
Ninth street and purchased some medi

ONtf 6! the most Important Â¦devel
opments yesterday In connection
â¢with the murder of Utitert tttaletf
Jt> was the positive contradiction
of Ltikherath's statement that he
did not know the unfortunate boy, When
taken Into custody on pusplclon of having
committed the uwful crime IiUkherath de
clared to Detective 'Ed Gibson that he
had never met young Hlslop,- notwith
standing that he had lived In the same
house with him. Charles Seibt; who, con
ducts a candy and fruit store' at 1944 Mar
ket street, says that Lukherath lied when
he declared that he was not acquainted
with the murdered boy.
Vlt was only last Wednesday evening,"
said Seibt to Detective Gibson, "that
Lukherath and Hislop vlelted" my place of
business together and Lukherath pur
chased 10 cents' worth of candy.' After
passing the candy to' Hislop he promised
to pay him 25 cents for the delivery to
him of every letter received at the'Haight
street residence addressed to him." \
â¢ "The boy, in anticipation of earning
some money, promised to bring to Lukhe
rath all letters that came to the house
addressed to him.
"They then left the store and walked up
Market street.",
Thinking that Seibt might be mistaken
in the Identification of the suspected mur
derer, Captain Seymour had Lukherath
brought f rom ', the prison and confronted
with the. candy dealer. \.
Identified by- Seibt. ;
"Is this the man whom you saw in your
store with Hislop?" asked the head of the
detective department, pointing to Luithe
rath. .
"I could not be mistaken," positively de
clared Seibt.* "I am willing to swear that
he is the man who was with Hislop when
they i visited my store, and bought some
candy." f â¢ . ' -Â¦" . Â¦
Seibt's statement and the positive dec
laration of Seibt conclusively prove that
the suspected murderer did not tell the
truth- when he positively declared that he
had never metyoung Hislop. Â¦ -,Â¦
Mrs. Houston, who lives, at 4 Â¦ Central
court, near the scene of the tragedy, told
the police yesterday that she had seen a
man answering Lukherath's" description
at about 8:30 o'clock on the night of the
murder standing on Haight street almost
opposite the Hislop residence. After be
ing shown Lukherath she. declared that he
answered the description of- the man she
had seen. As he was some distance from
her she could not see his face, but from
the general make up Â¦: she is confident
Lukherath is the man she saw.
Last night Lukherath was subjected to
a rigid cross-examination by Captain Sey
mour and District Attorney Byington.
Sergeant - Christiansen acted as - ; inter
preter. After saying that his true name
was Herman Lukherath he made the fol
lowing statement:
"I left my home In Norway about thir
teen months ago and came to this city by
way of New York. Harry Smith, whose
Â¦name has also-been brought Into the case,
made the trip with me. After arriving in
this city we went to a lodging house on
Third street, but as we were not satisfied,
at my suggestion we moved to the Hislop
residence. We left there on March 9, as
the room we occupied was cold and cheer
less, and went to live at our present abode
at 318 Laguna street. Saturday eveningâ
the date of the murder â Smith and I met
In front of the sausage place where I am
employed. We. went to a saloon at Ninth
and Howard â¢ streets and : after leaving
Smith I returned to the sausage place and
was paid- my wages, amounting. to $10. I
met another employe of the sausage fac
tory and took- him to the saloon where
Smith was waiting for, me.- Â¦ : Â¦.

. That President McKinley waÂ« the guest
of the. people of this city In every sense
of the term was proven yesterday, when
the finance committee of the citizens' re
ception committee received the bills of the
caterer who furnished the provisions for
the President and | his entourage during
his stay at the Scott residence. ;The pub
licity of this proof, so timely given, will
unquestionably bo a matter of sincere con
gratulation not only to the public at largo,
and to thejreceptlon committee but to Mr.
Scott and to his friends.
The presentation of the caterer's ac
count tor provisions used at the Presi
dent's temporary home and for the hiring
of servants to wait upon the President
und the members of his party eradicates
the unjust Impression that Henry T. Bcott
had monopolized the chief executive as
his exclusive guest or in the slightest way
/lau attempted to bear a burden which
me people of thlu.city h*4 so gladly and
enthusiastically assumed.
The President wan as much the guest

chief executive residedi The contract of
the caterer was based ori a sojourn of one
week, but the Illness of Mrs* MdKloley
caused the retention of his services for
double that time.
A similar increase in expense was expe
rienced as to the use of carriages for the
Presidential party. When the contracts
were awarded the committee figured on
the use of carriages for the various pa
rades and for the personal use of the
Cabinet members and attaches for but ono
week. The Item for carriage hire was, of
course, largely Increased by the extra
week spent in this city by the Presiden
tial party. Leaving out the expense of
carriages for the parades, the citizens'
committee will be called upon -to pay
twice as much for the use of carriages by
the Presidential party as was originally
estimated.
The viands and flowers prepared for the
Ohio banquet will have to be paid for,
though they were not utilized. The ban
quet was to have taken place on Thurs
day, May 16, and the first intimation that
the President would be . obliged to cancel
his engagements owing to the illness of
Mrs. McKinley was exclusively announced
in The Call on the previous day. Â¦'- .'
F. W. Dohrmann, chairman of the fin
ance committee of the reception commit
tee, said yesterday that the bills of ex
pense were being audited, and as soon as
possible a detailed statement would be
made public and a copy furnished to each
subscriber, to the -: entertainment fund.
When this statement is made public the
injustice of the suspicion against Mr.
Scott will be made apparent and the war
for . pre-eminence as entertainers, Â¦ social
but bitter, among some of our worthy cit
izens will happily be over. It is estimated
that the total expense will be about dou
ble the $30,000 which it was expected would
cover the cost of entertaining the Presi
dential party for one week. . Mr. Dohr
mann said that a number of subscribers
had promised to make extra donations to
the entertainment fund. â¢Â¦
Decorations Cost $9414 05. .
The committee on decorations, of which
Andrea Sbarboro is chairman, has practi
cally finished its report, showing that
$9414 05 was used for street display.
The Whyly-Hendy Company win receive
{1800 for lighting the ferry tower for five
nights. This sum includes the placing of
the incandescent lamps upon the struc
ture.. The finance committee has not yet
decided as to whether it will pay the cost
of illuminating the City Hall or if that
expense shall be borne by the city.
The arc electric lights on : Market and
other streets cost $3125 and the cost of the
evergreens strung across , the roadways
figures up to $950. Much comment has
been caused by the fact that- the decayed
evergreens have been J allowed to remain
in place long after the President has left
the city. .
Chairman Sharboro said yesterday that
the. San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany had contracted to put up all the
wires and lights and had agreed to take
the same down. It was understood by the
lighting company Â¦ that the florist should
be permitted to strine evergreens on the
wires, but that the j company should re
move them. . â¢ Â¦ Â¦ ' â¢ ; - Â¦
Must Take Down Evergreens.
Mr. Sharboro yesterday notified the gas
and : electric company that it- must pro
ceed to take down the wires without fur
ther delay, and the manager of the com
pany promised that the work would be
done at once. The contract for evergreens
was awarded to Jacquemet & Co. .

the badges furnished the various commit
tees.' Â¦ . Â¦ . Â¦ â¢ Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ 'Â«.' ,'"\ Â¦- .
Felgenbaum & Co. 1 are to t>e paid $335 for
flags used at the . ferry depot reception
and $31 35 for flags used on the exterior of
the building. Badges for the Native Sons'
reception cost $252, while the cost of plac
ing, flags in position on the streets calls
tor the payment of $175. â¢ ...
" The > California Fireworks â¢ Company Is
to be paid $1813 85 for the red fire and
>ther glaring displays made during the
week of May 13. The committee spent $70
for printing "20,000 circulars asking the
public to decorate buildings and for the
iistributlon of the printed J matter. J.
