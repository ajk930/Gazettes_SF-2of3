speaker declared that in the latter city
the joy and gladness were underlined with
sadness and misery. He said that the

usually end in the morgue.
Dr. Jordan spoke in high praise of the

It Is- expected that the canon on di

House of Deputies sitting as a committee
of the whole. Sharp debate is looked for,
as it is known that many of the dis

of Bishops. Among the deputies are some
of the most learned legal lights in the
country and their views on the vital mat

ment that industrial emancipation would
bring on the age of peace.
Frederick Foster of the Typographical
Union of this city spoke briefly of the
antagonistic relations existing among the
employers a.nd those they employ. The
object of the society was to harmonize
these^ conditions, so that the social lot of
wage earners might be improved. He ar
gued that it was to. the interest of . em
ployers to come to a speedy

Before pronouncing benediction Bishop
Potter complimented the local press for
its faithful reports of the sessions of the
Episcopal convention. The following
statement was received with applause:
I take pleasure In calling to your attention
We will never solve the question of labor
until the organizing minds, the guiding hands
and Â«mploying managers are identified with
the unions with which the employes are ldenti-
It Is not surprising: that the New Testament,
under conditions which prevailed at its con
ception, ehould have assimilated the Ideas of
the times. The pagan Idea, which was then
In force, became hardened Into Inexorable
forms by which the strong became more pow
erful and the. weak were forced to the wall.
The fraternj.1 Idea iÂ« the real basis of all
human society. The feudal agree, which we
think were KCSM than the age In which we
live, were ir fc-jme respects very much better.
It was in feudal timea when the principle of
trades unionism was born. In those days these
unions were known as guilds. We, who to-day
may deem our trades unions as perfect, should
etufly the guild system of the dark ages. Our
system of trades unions has not the striking
feature possessed by the guilds, which was a
mutual dependence upon each other of the
employer and the employed. Both of these
elements defended a common Interestâ and that
Is not the ruie that obtains to-day.
Bishop Potter was then introduced by
Bishop Coleman. The venerable prelate
was received with applause. He began
his discourse with a review of the three
great ideasâ monarchial, military and
aristocraticâ which animated men in their
social relations since the Christian era
began. Under the monarchial rule au
thority was exercised with a harsh and
inexorabJfe Â£and. Under the military
forms of, government the principle of
brotherly love became^ a myth to be
laughed at and scorned. Under the aris
tocratic regimes the needs of the common
people were seldom If ever recognized, the
inevitable result being discord, degrada
tion and social gloom. Resuming, the
Bishop said:

vancement of the Interests of
X-abcr. Several addresses were made
upon the subject of organized labor, but
the principal speaker of the evening was
Bishop Potter of New York.
The service began with the speaking of
the Apostles' Creed by the audience un
der the leadership of Bishop Coleman.
The Bishop then made the opening an
nouncement. He said that the society
â¢under whose auspices the meeting was
assembled was a missionary society form
ed fn the Interest of labor. This was one
of the gTand works which the Episcopal
church was undertaking.
It hoped to mitigate eome of the evils
of the industrial system and to assist the
laborer to secure the wages and other
considerations that are justly his due.
There are conditions which hamper the
\u25a0work, and these must be overcome. One
of the means employed was to open
braach societies of the C. A. A. L L. in
all parts of the country- There were
some who believed that the church should
not engage In work of that kind, "but,"
resumed the speaker, "we are brethren
who should live together In fairness and
good will."

"When Bishop Potter concluded his ad
dress Miss Harriet Keyser, general sec
retary of the C. A. A. I. L,., was intro
duced. She told of the organization of
the association In 1887, and outlined the
work In which it Is engaged. The- main
object of the society was to teach mem
bers the .concientious use of the ballot,
although no partisan politics are encour
aged. The society aimed to promote fel
lowship among men. She alluded to the
abuses of labor In New York, of people
living in frightful tenements, and won ap
plause with the statement that '*no syn
dicate can purchase sunlight and air,
those unpurchasable gifts of God." She
AIMS OF THE SOCIETY.
The Intorei and employer must be brought
closer tcicether. You may legislate aa you
please, impose taxation as you please, or by
any othÂ»r process readjust the conflicting ele
ments of modern society, but if you have not
your henrt in the work you will fail utterly.
The solution of the labor problem consists in
t*i* cwskening in the hearts of the employer
a deep concern for the welfare of those who
are in his employ. Their ideas and hopes should
not be antagonistic. They should mingle to
gether and observe the laws of social contact.
Their aims being identical, their methods
should be harmonious If those aims are to be
subserved.
I stood one day . la front of a factory and
eaw 600 men Ruing out io dinner. I said to
the owner oi the factory: "How many of
these men do you know?" He looked at me
astonished, and though he did not say it, I
knew he felt that I was very presumptuous.
The times require a change from conditions
like this. It has always been a question In
my mind whether the industrial development
of the nineteenth century has been of benefit
to human society; I once dined with a family
in New York, the housewife of which went to
a store and bought everything for the table,
including pressed meat, baked beans, brown
bread ana canned fruits. Everything came In
tins or glass Jars, and not a thing was pre
pared in that home.
When I was young, women touched home
life with the chaime of their personality. It
was an lasp!t alien to dine at a housewife's
table 9lty years ago. The modern eystem, the
result of advancement along Industrial lines,
seems to me to be radically wrong and worthy
of rtmodeiing. - \u25a0
We have not yet learned to extinguish that
characterietic by which we differentiate be
tween those antagonistic elements that make
up modern society. There is no complete har
mony of re#timent and idea. The mischief oÂ£
thÂ« modern social order is that the moment
people begin to accumulate money or lands or
any other valuables, other people begin to dif
ferentiate themselves from the cause that
should be harmoniously co-operated in by all
alike. Oarist received sinners and ate with
them, but the modern Phariseeism prompts
men to ignore those who are beneath them
socially, or whose degree is of the baser sort.
The greatest missionary society in the world
Is that society which follows the precepts of
Christ and establishes a brotherhood among all
sorts and conditions of men. That is the aim
of the Church Association for the Advance
ment of the Interests of Labor. It is to rem
edy defects we come in contact with every
day that the association was called into being.
Bishop Potter then spoke of^the opera
tions of the Board of Mediation and Con
ciliation of Ner, York,\df.7TrtrtdrTie'~tÂ«r
president. He said the board came into
being without authority and added that
that was the reason probably why he was
chosen as its president.. The board was
in existence some ten years and had set
tled a number of momentous labor dis
turbances The operations of the board
were conducted on the principle that
nothing tangible could be accomplished if
the question of social contact was ig

163 to 157.
The original Motion was then discussed.
Lay Deputy James C. Buxton of North
Carolina arose and said that the subject
under consideration had been discussed
through the newspapers and religious pa
pers and was familiar to the whole coun
try; that the eyes of the people of the
church were looking to the convention to
take some action and that the people of
this city were interested in the discus
sion. He thought no member of the house
would use language that could not be
heard by the ladies. He therefore hoped
the house would not sit with closed doors.
A vote was taken and the motion was
lost by a vote of 201 to 126.
Deputy Lewis made a motion to ad

The motion to have the committee of
the whole sit with closed doors during the
discussion of marriage and divorce, was
ister, through whom they then exchange their
marriage vows, and â¢ who having pronounced
them in the name of . the Holy Trinity to be
man and wife invokes upon their union the
blessing of the Triune God."
The reason why I have been led and urged
to offer this as an amendment to the report Is
that I know of no subject that can be brought
before this convention that touches so closely
and practically the life of our own church
people and the people of this land, and the
Christian people of the United States are
watching this convention to see 'what we are'
going to say about marriage and what we are
going to do about divorce.
I submit that the language of the first para
graph In canon 26 sent to us by the House of
Bishops Is- inaccurate and Infelicitous â "Par
ties entering into this state of life." Matri
mony Is not a state of life. It Is an act only.
It Is understood, of course, that the consent
given is given to Almighty God, and on that
rests the validity of the marriage contract.
I also urge that there must be some one
who knows that that consent has been given
and so the amendment' says "they must con
sent to a minister. " I believe that this church
has a right to say that marriage Is something
more than a mere consent, and that mere con
sent, while It will validate the marriage in the
eyes of the law, is not sufficient to satisfy the
demands of the chureh. and so there Is added
that after the consent is given they then ex-.
change their marriage vows.
The reason why this Is added is that con
sent is something that may be given to-day
and may be withdrawn to-morrow, but a vow
Is something very different; It can only be
disposed of In two waysâ it may be kept or it
may be broken, and it ought to be understood
that the dissolution of marriage means some
thing more than the mere withdrawal of con
sent; It means the violation of a vow taken
before Almighty God.
A resolution was offered by a member
from the diocese â¢ of "Western Virginia to
have the convention go into committee of
.the whole and to sit with closed doors.
The resolution waa divided and the con
vention decided to go into committee of

Rev. Dr. Greer of New York then called
for. the order of the day. This was the
discussion on marriage and divorce, and
was declared in order. The first speaker
'was Rev. Dr. Plttlnger. In part ha said:
It Is with no little hesitation that an humble
priest ventures to offer a substitute or amend
ment, but I submit that for a learned gentle
man, sitting in an editorial "chair, to theorize
about the subject of marriage and divorce is
one thing, while'to a man who Is on the line of

In the life of the American ptople it is another
thing.

amendment to the report of the ! committee of
this house on the subject of marriage and di

a substitute for the first section sent to this

Rev. Mr. Tayler of Los Angeles said the
proposed amendment tied the .hands of
tho house. There were eighty votes in
the House of Bishops, but the convention
being held at points remote to many of
their dioceses they were unable f<.n" that
reason and on account of age anil infirm
ity to attend. Not more than seventy at
tended the conventions and of this num
ber several were absent at one tinje and
another, so that about sixty-five usually
transacted the business of the House of
Bishops. To carry any measure it. was ab
solutely necessary to have forty-one votes
out of the sixtv-five voting. While the
House of Deputies might pays a measure
unanimously, before it could become ef
fective it \u25a0was necessary not only to pass
this house, but tc overcome the majority
in the House of Bishops. In his opinion
this invalidated the proposed amendment.
: A vote was taken on ihe proposed
amendment and it was carried by a vote
of 40 clerics and 44 laymen to 12 clerics
and 9 laymen in the negative; divided -7.
Dr. Grammer then introduced the fol
lowing resolution, which was placed on
the calendar with a similar resolution of
fered by. Dr. Mann:
Resolved, the House of Bishops concurring.
That the marginal readings for the English ver
sion of the Apocrypha, reported to this house
by the joint commission, be published under the
direction of said commission and are hereby

proposition was one that came up in

important measure that had come before
a convention of the church since 1769. It
contemplated a revolutton, and 'its effect
and purpese were not generally under
stood and appreciated. He earnestly
urged that action on It be deferred till the

The secretary then read the rroposed

lows :
Mr.Saundcrs offered as an amendment

Rev. Dr. Gre^r of New York was de
sirous of learning what action the House

AMENDMENT TO CONSTITUTION.
ion and for that reason he moved the
adoption of all but that resolution.
In view of the fact that the next regular
step in the proceedings under this head
must be a request from the House of
Bishops for conference on the subject, a
delegate objected to the consideration at
that time of the resolutions and under the
rule they went over.

Rev. Dr. Payne read the report of the
minority. They were opposed to the re
quest being granted. The report showed
that the territory to be set aside for
missionary districts would comprise 56
703 square miles with a population of 600 -

charged from further consideration of the
subject. Both reports were pla'ced on the
calendar.
Rev. Dr. Neville of Rome, as delegate of
the Convocation of American Churches in
Europe, presented two memorials, which
\u25a0were placed on the calendar. The first
asked for representation of such* churches
in the General Convention, with limited
power to vote. The second asked the con
vention to consider whether- some better
proi'lslon than that now existing could
not be devised for the Episcopal oversight
of s-uch. churches, suited to their growth
and improved condition.

lows :
Dr. Mann said that the third resolution
was the only one on which he could an
ticipate any debate or difference of.opin-
..Rev. Dr. Mann of West Missouri offered

Whereas, the General Convention of 1901 hav
ing Just massed an amendment of the consti
tution giving one ypte each to the clerical and
lay delegates, when vote Is taken by orders, and
Instantly the house was In an uproar
of disapproval and dissent. Rev. Dr.
Fulton withdrew his second and a motion
was made to lay the proposed amendment
on the table, followed by a motion to
throw it out entirely and refuse to con
sider it. The storm soon subsided arid the
house calmed down sufficiently to allow
the proposed amendment to take the reg
ular course in the hands of the commit
tee on constitutional amendments.
Thomas H. Walbridge of Ohio presented
the following resolution, which was re
ferred to the committee on'constltutlonal
amendments:
Because with all frankness, gentlemen, per
sonally I do not consider it necessary to the
administration of the Lord's supper that the
administrator shall have received episcopal
sanction.
Rev. Dr. Huntington asked the gentle

enant aÂ» may be prescribed by canon of the
General Convention to use in public worship
In the eaid congregation such form or directory
as the General Convention by canon shall set
forth and authorize.
Rev. Dr. E. W. Donald of Massachusetts
offered an amendment to the constitution,
prefacing the offer by saying:
Whatever the informed gentlemen of the con
vention may think of the effect of the defeat
of the so-called Huntington amendment on the
Protestant Episcopal church, I think there can
be no doubt In the minds of a majority of the
convention of what the effect of its defeat is
to be upon the attitude of the Christian people
of America toward the Episcopal church. I
think the effect of It is to be disastrous, and,
therefore, with great reluctance, I venture to
ask that the following resolution may be rc
lerred to the committee on amendments to the
constitution. If the gentlemen will turn to
page 2S6 of the Journal of 1838 it will obviate
the necessity of my reading my entire resolu
tion :
Rev. Dr. McConnell moved that the me
morial from the people of Hawaii asking
for the establishment of a diocese be re
ferred to the committee on new dioceses.
The motion was carried.
Whereas, the announcement of the death of
the Right Rev. Alexander Burgess, late Bishop
of Quiney. has been made during the sitting
of the House of Clerical and Lay Deputies;
therefore.
Resolved. That this house has heard with
sorrow of the departure of this faithful servant
of Christ and is grateful to God for the emi
nent, services which he has been permitted to
render to the church and kingdom of Christ.
Dr. Beatty said he proposed the adop
tion of the resolution, as it was his privi
lege of voting for Bishop Burgess when
he was elected president of the House of
Deputies. It was adopted by a rising
vote.

NEW YORK. Oct. 10.â To attack the
city of Panama and to destroy or capture
Governor General Alban and forces is to
be the next move of the revolutionists on
the Isthmus of Panama. The hope of the
leaders was explained last night by Dr.
Restrepo, agent in this city for the Lib
eral, or insurgent, party in Colombia.
"I have received a code letter from a
lawyer in Panama, whose "name I would
gladly give except that it would imperil
his life." said Dr. Restrepo, "in which the
movements of one force there are record
ed. Within two weeks an expedition con
sisting of the civilian chief Don Diaz Do
mingo, General Lugo and General Cortis
soz and sixty stall officers have been
landed at Point Chame, fifty miles from
Panama. The expedition sailed from
Nicaragua and brought 2500 rifles, three
mountain Krupp guns and 500,000 car
tridges. Guerrillas of the surrounding
country have met the expedition, and
troops are now being drilled for *the at
tack upon Panama, which will be by both
land and sea. General Alban has less than
1000 soldiers in Panama, and. in the city
prisons are 500 Liberal prisoners. The for
eign element In Panama is all with us,
and 80 per cent of the natives. In fact,
the city is nearly deserted, as men have
gone to enlist with our troops. The
Cnited States battleship Iowa is in the
harbor, but I can assure you that no prop
erty of any United States citizens will be
molested. We have three thousand men
now under arms near Panama and two
gunboats. The attack will not be made
for several days. Then we shall demand
that General Alban and his forces sur
render. If our demands are not complied

from San Francisco. Mrs. Arthur Flckenshar
was the accompanist. ' Over one thousand Rovers
of music listened to the recital and opera, many
of them coming from San Jose and other neigh
boring towns.
"Hansel and Gretel" Is an old German
fairy tale in which two children. Hansel
and Gretel, sent into the woods to gather
berries, become lost and, as night draws
on, are badly frightened by the strange
sounds they hear and uncanny forms they
see. \u25a0 Finally the Sandman appears, lulls
them to sleep and they are then seen at
the close with protecting angels hovering
around them.
Miss Helen Heath's portrayal of the
character of Gretel was the hit . of the
evening. She acted the part perfectly and
her excellent soprano . voice was at its
best. Miss Mae Cullen played the part of
Hensel in a charmingly vivacious man
ner, eliciting frequent applause. Mrs.
Dexter had the difficult part of the Sand
man, but she acquitted herself admirably.
The prettiest feature of the opera was the
closing scene in the woods when the four
teen young ladies representing angels ap
peared hovering over the sleeping . chil
dren. They were attired in white and their
graceful movements were well set oft by
the stage setting of dark green.
The cast of the opera was as follows: . .
The opening- numbers of the programme
were the old German folk songs, "Drel
Roeseleln" and "Abschied," sung by a
double quartet composed of the Misses
Helen Heath, Mae Cullen, Maybelle Craig,
Mabel Gross, Jessie Burns, Lulu Feld
heim, Estelle Davidson and Mrs. Cecilia
Cox. The numbers were exceedingly well
rendered and enthusiastically received, as
were also the solos by Mrs. Cox, Mrs.
Carrie Brown Dexter and Miss Maud Fay.
Both Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Dexter sang
selections composed by FIckensher,, with
words by Professor Goebel. *

To Professor Goebel of the German de

Mr. Huntington admitted to-day, that
his aunt, Mrs. Collis P. Huntington, may
donate to the city of San Francisco the
big Huntington mansion on Nob Hill, in
that city.
Mr. Huntington said: "The belt line road
will be built, and "that soon. The story
that we paid $32,000 for the franchise for
the mere purpose of keeping out rjvals is
silly, to say the least. On the' contrary,
work on the belt line will be begun at
once, and it will be ready for service
within the time allowed in the franchise.
We already have on the ground sufficient
steel to set the work well along.
"Mr. Hellman 2nd I have had no oppor
tunity for discussion, for many weeks,
and our plans have been long In matur
ing, but we now have brought matters
to such a point that definite, final action
is necessary, and that is the reason of our
meeting here."
It is the avowed Intention of the Hunt
ington-Hellman syndicate to hereafter
make Los Angeles and its vlciniiy the
chief field of Its operations. It has been
generally understood for some time that
the Market Street railway system of San
Francisco has been all but transferred to
a wealthy Baltimore syndicate, and $15,
000.000 has been named as the purchase
price. - - . -. . -\u25a0::-" â¢
"We are preparing to spend a large
amonnt of money during the coming year,
and it will be spent in Los Angtles. I
cannot say what the amount will be, but
it will run into the millions." This was
the statement of Mr. Hellman.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10.â Two men of
many millions met in Los Angeles to-day
to discuss that portion of the city's fu
ture that is to be gridironed by urban and
interurban railway lines. They were H.
E. Huntington and I. W. Hellman, and It
was the first opportunity the two mag
nates had had for months for a solid busi
ness discussion.
Mr. Huntington came to town nearly a
week ago. Mr. Hellman arrived this
morning. They held a long 1 conference in
the afternoon and another at night in the
Hotel Van Nuys, and the result of their
agreement '\u25a0 means the distribution of a

CALL BTJREAJT, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â Bulgaria's
efforts to rescue Miss Stone may lead to
her death. From what the Washington
authorities have- been inclined to criticize
as dilatoriness the Bulgarian Government
has Jumped to the utmost energy in con
nection with Miss Stone's case. Advices
received by the State Department show
that a military force has been set in mo
tion against the mountain stronghold In
which the brigands with their captive
have taken refuge. Consul General Dick
inson fears that if any atack is made the
brigands will not hesitate to murder Miss
Stone. He is making urgent representa
tions to the Bulgarian Government to di
rect its force to await the result of the
negotiations wih the brigands before
authorizing an attack. Once the woman
is liberated this Government will urge
Bulgaria to take vigorous measures for
the arrest and punishment of all con
cerned In Miss Stone's abduction.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 10.â The sur
rounding movement of Turkish and Bul
garian troops on Gueltepe Mountain, on
the Turko-Bulgarian frontier, near Dub
nitza, has commenced. The presence of
Miss Stone and the bandits on the moun

Dubnitza are supplying the outlaws with
food.
LONDON, Oct. 10.â With reference to
the announcement that the Turkish and
Bulgarian troops are surrounding the ab
ductors of Miss Stone the Globe says that
It considers that unless tne movement Is
suspended until she is safe out of the
hands of the brigands there will infallibly
be a repetition of the tragedy in Greece
during the year 1870, when Lord Muncas
ter and a party were captured. Lord
Muncaster was released In order to nego
tiate for a ransom of Â£25,000.) Then, as
now, an attempt was made to surround
the brigands, with the result that four
gentlemen of the party were murdered.
Lord and Lady Muncaster and a party
of English travelers were seized by Greek
brigands April 11, 1870, at Oropos, near
Marathon. Lord Muncaster and the la
dies of the party were sent to treat for
the Â£25,000 demanded as ransom, with ,a
free pardon for the brigands. The latter
were surrounded by troops, and in re
treatingÂ»on"April 21 killed Mr. Vyner, Mr.
Lloyd, Mr. Herbert and Count de Boyl.
The incident caused great excitement,
especially as many influential persons
were charged with connivance at the
brigandage. Several of the brigands were
killed and seven were captured, tried and
condemned May 23 of the same year. On
June 20, 1870, five of the brigands were ex

Paragraph 2 of section 3 was then offered
by Deputy Lewis, the leader of the debate.
"The Rev. Dr. Tayler of Los Angeles called
attention to what he thought might prove to
be an ambiguity to many people. To clear
it up he inquired whether the expression, "Such
\u25a0witnesses," referred to the witnesses men
tioned in the first case as well as those men
tioned In the second case. He was* quite sure
that the committee did not so Intend, and he
therefore proposed an amendment making the
second paragraph read:
"No minister shall solemnize a marriage ex
cept In the presence of two witnesses. In case
the parties are unknown to the minister he
shall not solemnize the marriage without the
presence of witnesses to whom the parties
are personally known, unless in the judgment
of the minister It shall be Impracticable to ob
tain such witnesses."

PROVISO FOR WITNESSES.
The amendment offered by the Rev. Dr.
Nevins to strike out the last eight words of
the section was then voted upon and was car
ried by 224 ayes to 59 noes.
A motion to adopt paragraph 1 of section 3,
as amended, was then put before the com
mittee and adopted by a vote of ,192 ayes to
136 noes.
A vote was taken on the amendment present
ed by Deputy Evans, which, however, met with
defeat.
"No minister shall solemnize the marriage of
any minor unless the parent or guardian of such
minor is present and consenting, or shall have
given written consent to the marriage, or Is
permanently resident In a foreign country."
. Deputy Old of Southern Virginia did not
think that the Evans amendment would, meet
the difficulty. Ke did not see the need of the
section at all, as he felt sure that the clergy
could not go wrong if they followed the laws
of the State In which they solemnized mar
riages.
The Rev. Dr. Bennett of Newark opposed the
substitution of the word "minor" in the sec
tion. -
Deputy Rowland Evans . of '\u25a0 Pennsylvania
moved as a substitute for the pending amend
ment the following: Strike out the words:
"Person who under, the law of the place of mar
riage is not free to marry without the consent
of parent or guardian." and insert in place of
those words the word "minors," so that the
clause should read as follows:
The hoilse roared with laughter at the verbal
slip. "I hope that this lapsus linguae will
prove prophetic," said he, and the house laugh
ed with him at the deft way In which he had
extricated himself and voted with him to re
consider.
. If the section did not mean that the consent
of the parent or guardian living in a foreign
country was not required, then what did it
mean? This was ' intended to waive the con
sent of the parent or guardian because that
person was in Rome, perhaps-. "The committee
had left it in section 3, and then they, had said
that ministers can disregara me law.
Deputy Stetson of New York hoped that the
last eight words of paragraph 1 of section 3
be stricken out. The paragraph had been in
serted to call the attention of the clergy to a
particular phase of laws relating to the consent
of parents to children's marriage and the canon,
should not allow those laws te be violated.
CAUSES A ROAR OF LAUGHTER.
Rev. Dr. Gatt of Easton said that his object
in rising was simply to make a motion because
there was too much in this section 3 that they
could not afford to lose, and there seemed to
him to be some danger of losing it unless they
went back upon their action in regard to the
motion of Dr. Nevlns of Rome. â¢ â¢ â¢ ;
"I therefore," said he, "as one who voted
against his resolution, move that we reconsider
the resolution as offered by the Bishop of
Rome."
In their own house took up the report of the
sub-committee, and the result of their action
as presented by 'their own committee was sim
ply to indorse what the deputies' committee
had reported, leaving out entirely this question
of prohibited degrees. Since nothing was said
in the message of the House of Bishops about
prohibited degrees; the committee of the house
had omitted any mention of them.-
Deputy Hicks of Arkansas^thought that para
graph 1 of section 3 was not required at all,
for the reason that section 2 provided that the
clergy must observe the laws of the State in
solemnizing marriage^. â¢
Deputy George F. Henry of Iowa said that
to his â¢ mind it was perfectly plain that they
were saying in-^thls section that the ministers
of the church could violate the law. Section
2 required compliance with the law. The first
clause pf section 3 said that if the parents be
resident of a. foreign country the minister could
disresard the law.
The Rev. Dr. Ely of Southern Ohio moved
that a vote be taken on each section sep
arately.
The motion to strike out section 1 was de
feated by a .vote of 156 noes to 143 'ayes.
The mectlon was then adopted by the com
mittee.
A debate followed on the motion to adopt
section 2 of the canon.
The Rev. Dr. Davenport of Tennessee thought
that the second section was absolutely re
quired. He was of the opinion that ministers
could not be too careful In the solemnization
of marriages.
"I once went out of my State," he said, "to
perform a marriase and was about to do so
when I discovered that I required a special
Tne Rev. Dr. Pittenger of South Carolina
moved to amend the section by substituting:
the words "holy ordinance" In place of "ser
vice." A vote on Dr. Fittenger's amendment
was taken and it was defeated.
The Rev. Dr. Estill of Kentucky moved that
the two sections be stricken out of the pro
posed canon.
Deputy Lewis of Pennsylvania, in explana
tion of the house committee's report, said that
if they were going 1 to pass a canon on the sol
emnization of matrimony it was thought wise
In the first section to state what the solemniz
ation of matrimony was, and they had tried to
do it In a way which in their judgment, while
perfectly true and clear, would not be likely
to cause any particular amount of criticism
as tending to give countenance to any par
ticular theory. They also wanted it to be
clearly understood that by their legislation
they were not dealing with the subject of mar
riage. They wished to make it perfectly clear
what it was they were dealing with and the
way in which they were dealing with it. ;
age and residence of" each party. Such record
shall be signed by the minister who solemnizes
the marriage, 'and, if practicable, by the mar
ried parties and at least two witnesses of the
marriage.
"(4) No minister shall solemnize a marriage
between any two persons unless nor until, by
inquiry, he shall have satisfied himself that
neither person is the husband or the wife of
any other person then living or has been the
husband or the wife of any other person -then
living, unless the former marriage was an
nulled by a decree of some civil court of com
petent jurisdiction for cause existing before
such former marriage."
Deputy Lewis \u25a0 of Pennsylvania then . moved
the adoption of section 1 of the proposed canon.
Deputy Bassett of Rhode Island thought that
sections 1 and 2 were unnecessary- They simply
defined what marriage was under the laws of
the church, and that explanation could be
found in the prayer book. . â¢

The Rev. Dr. Davenport of Tennessee ex
plained for the enlightenment of the Rev. Dr.
Spalding of Alabama as to the omission In
the report of a table of prohibited degrees, say
ing that the sub-committee in their report to
the joint committee left out that question en
tirely, while the report which Dr. Spaldlng
had in his hand and which contained the table
of prohibited degrees was originally reported by
a committee of this house.
The motion of Dr. Edsall to entirely strike
out section S was also defeated when voted on.
The original motion to adopt section 2 of the
cancn was then put to a vote and carried.
Section 3 of the proposed canon was then
brought up, to be considered by paragraphs. !
After the. first paragraph of the section had
been read, and a motion had been made for ita
adoption, the Rev. Dr. Nevins of Rome, repre
senting the Episcopal American churches in
Europe, moved to amend by striking out the
words "or is permanently resident in a foreign
country." He asked. Deputy Lewis why the
final clause had been inserted. ,
Deputy Lewis admitted that he could not
remember, but the Rev. Dr. Saunders of Mas
sachusetts, a member of the committee, stated
that it was put in at the express request of
the Rev. Dr. Richards of Rhode Island.
"He Informed me," said the speaker, "that
In the large manufacturing towns in the East
it was impossible to get the consent of parents
to the marriage of children when the parents
lived in many countries of Europe."
Deputy Stanley of Washington thought that
It would be a hardship where children whose
parents permanently lived abroad should be
compelled to secure the consent of the parents
in order to be married.
The amendment of the Rev.^ Dr. Nevins was
voted ur>on and lost.
The Rev. Dr. Spaldins of Alabama thought
the entire canon was defective in that it did
not state the prohibited degrees of marriage.
He asked for an exalanation from the com
mittee.

amend. the section to read, "In the solemn

The amendment of Dr. Bnos was voted upon
and defeated.

Deputy Lewis accepted the amendment of
Dr. Tayler and asked for a vote.
Deputy John T. Hicks of Arkansas proposed
the following amendment:
"No minister shall solemnize. & marriage In
case the parties are unknown to thÂ» minister
without the presence of at least two persons
to whom the parties are personally known."
Deputy Lewis explained that the paragraph
was Intended to do away with private mar
riages and t<9 prevent fraudulent ones.
The Rev. Dr. Huntington of New York thÂ«a
secured tha floor and said: ".V :
"I agree in Inferring that under toma cir
cumstances the canon would allow the solemn
ization of marriage without -witnesses, accord
ing to this amendment. "We have been told
that there are States where no witnesses are
required. There is no State where the law as It
stands at present does sot require witnesses.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the presence of this company. Two
witnesses are necessary to make company. Wo
must bear in mind that there are four parties
to the ordinance of holy matrimony as this
church has received the same, the man. the
woman, the minister and the representative of
society."
The amendment proposed by Deputy Hicks
of Arkansas was voted upon and defeated.
A vote on the amendment of Rev. Dr. Tay

taken and resulted in the affirmative.
The paragraph as amended was then adopted.
As the hour of adjournment had arrived a

of its life the Brotherhood of St. Andrew
had been confronted by many trying; con

he stated has now a membership of over
4000. He declared that the order has con
stantly, expanded, that it has invaded
Canada, crossed the Atlantic to Scotland
and England and that chapters have been
formed in South Africa, along; the Yukon
and in far off Australia.
In conclusion Secretary Wood stated
that he thought that the brotherhood
could look forward with considerable con

confidence ought to be supported by a
good deal of determination.

opening ceremony a hundred delegates
were present, almost every State In the
Union being represented.
Frederick Rice Rowell of Seattle, 'Wash.,
delivered a welcoming address, in. which

MARRIAGE DISCUSSED AT LEN6TH
The Bishop of Tokio told of Japan as
he knew it after twenty years' residence.
He had found it a land of contrasts, a
fertile field for the student of sociology.
In a Japanese library, he said, one might
find a translation of "Little Lord Fauntle
roy" 6ide by side with a Japanese classic
of ponderous depth, and both of them
well thumbed.
So far as civilization was concerned the
prelate paid a high tribute to the Japan
ese. He found them more adaptable than
their Chinese neighbors and thought the
future held a brighter promise for them.
He compared their moral and religious
development with their business instinct.
"Of their morality, the less said the bet
ter." There were laws in Japan, he said,
\u25a0which forbade parents selling their daugh
ters into lives of ehame; but not only are
these laws not enforced, he said, but the
authorities conspire with the parents and
the purchasers of their daughters for the
purpose of maintaining these contracts.
The adoption of the Christian religion",
he continued, was Japan's only hope of
ealvation. She has religions in plenty,
but that of the Christ Is the only one
\u25a0which carries with its spread the found
ing of hospitals, schools and asylums for
the seed and indigent.
But for the criminal mistakes of Roman
Catholic missionaries two hundred years
ago Japan would now be a Christian coun
try, he sal* 1 He told how the acts of
these missionaries had aroused the coun
try and resulted in their expulsion from
the land and the martyrdom, of many of
their followers. Among the descendants
of these martyrs, he said, were to be
found the Christians of to-day.
He paid a tribute to the powerful influ
ence of the Ja.DanesÂ» press, and said that
many of the "most influential papers in
that land were now exerting their influ
ence in behalf of the Christian religion.

The opportunities of the Episcopal
board and told something of
tlie â¢work accomplished and the obstacles
to be overcome. The report of the com
mittee intrusted with the amendment of
c&i:on No. 7 was read, but will not be
considered until this evening. This
amendment deals with the concentration
of the work at present done by the board
of missions and the turnine of it over to
an executive committee.
THE session of the board of mis
sions held last evening in Trin
ity Church was devoted prin
cipally to the missions in China
and Japan. Representatives of
both these fields addressed the
given written consent to the marriage or Is

In the matter of civilization, the- mis

her schools, her systems of education, her
universities will stand comparison with
similar institutions of any other country.
Christianity, he concluded, was the one
thing needed to place Japan in her proper
place on the world's stage.
The board of missions will hold another
session this evening.
church In Japan are great, and if oppor
tunities are responsibilities we are face to
face with a serious duty toward the little
brown man, he continued.
The Bishop of Shanghai said that he
felt in speaking in San Francisco about
China he was doing so with a weight
about his neck.
"You know the Chinese quarter here,
he said, "and the question will naturally
arise in your mind as to whether it is
with matter so low in the human plane
that the missionary in China has to deal.
I accept the handicap."
He then said that the missionaries
were taking Chinese such as are located
in San Francisco's Chinese quarter and
turning them Into civilized Christians.
The missionaries, he said, had come mt
of the recent persecutions in China more
than ever determined to go on with their
work in that land. Christianity, he held,
was the only hope for a people so situated
that in all their broad land there was not
a single force to attract the best that
was in them, not a single hope around
which they could rally.
While nothing, he believed, could pre
vent the ultimate division of the Chinese
empire, Christian education would do
much to stem the tide of disorganization.
The Bishop of Kyoto, "young man elo
quent," as a delegate spoke of him after
his address, spoke of Japan in interesting
vein. Japan, he said, was a living illus
tration of the fact that civilization did
not necessarily mean Christianity. Con
tinuing, he said:
Take the locomotives. We are told that the
Introduction of the locomotive into Japan would
mean death to the temple. As a matter of fact
It has been the finest promoter of prosperity
the temple and the doctrines that go with it
ever had. Instead of the visit to the temple
city being the occasion of a life-time, special
excursions at reduced rates place the opportu
nity within, the frequent grrasp of all.
We were told that with a knowledge of the
marvels of electricity heathen superstition
would die a natural death. Instead of that I
have Btood in heathen temples among: crowds
of the most abject ldolators, have seen them
bowing- down before an Idol, the gigantic eyes
of which were lighted with the most modern
high-power arc lights.

TTZHILE the local Episcopalians have left nothing undone zvhich would tend to the comfort
f/ [/ and well being of the visiting churchmen, it has been the pleasant privilege of The Call to
keep the visitors in close and constant touch with their widely scattered homes: '
Local church authorities have equipped headquarters, at 1703 Bush street, where the visit
ing Bishops and Deputies can en joy in comfort such leisure as the intervals of their work affords.
In the same building ike Brotherhood of St. Andrew has provided a "rest room" for delegates.
The Call has undertaken to maintain at these headquarters during the convention a daily
service of newspapers from all over the United States; This service has already been inaugurated,
and now nearly every visiting churchman, either before or after convention hours, drops in at
1703 Bush street to read the home. news in the home paper. â¢
The Bishops' quarters dozun stairs and the "rest room" upstairs are equally well provided in
the newspaper line. These papers are received by The Call as quickly after publication as the
raihvay mail service can carry them. Each day, immediately upon their receipt, The Call sends
them by special messenger to the convention t headquarters, where they are at the disposal â¢ of the
visitors. f -.
These papers supplied daily by The Call are from every State in the Union, and' from every
town that boasts a daily nezvspaper. In fact, at convention headquarters, during the convention J
will be found nearly every newspaper publishedHn the United States.

FIERCE STORM OF CONDEMNATION AROUND
THE ASSASSIN NEWSPAPER, THE EXAMINER
THE SAN "FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1901.
THE Examiner says: "The man who attacks this newspaper attacks a great many millions of good citizens. The great majority of the attacks, as our readers know, are
based on envy and on the hatred of those who have been thwarted in their schemes of plunder. The cells of prisons are filled with men who loathe this newspaper.
Thousands of men not yet in prison detest the Examiner because it prevents them from carrying out plans as criminal as any that have sent men to jail."
There we have the opinion and Judgment of the Examiner upon the men and {he organizations that have condemned and thrown it out, together with its allies in Chi
cago and New York. They attack and condemn it because it has "thwarted them in their schemes of plunder," and "because it prevents them from carrying out plans as criminal
as any that have sent men to jail." . â¢â¢ .
This is of the same class of utterances as confirmed criminals indulge in against the Judge, Prosecuting Attorney and Jury that have enforced the law and convicted them of
crime. \u25a0 *. -â¢ â¢
That the public may see what kind of men and organizations are described by the Examiner as "thwarted plunderers" and "criminals" as great as any that have been sent
to Jail, we submit the following list of those who have attacked, condemned and thrown it out.
That discredited sheet can make its columns nearly as lively as by its cartoons of President McKinley if it will give its readers a history of "the schemes of plunder" and
"plans as criminal as any that have sent men to jail," of which the following condemners of Hearst's papers have been guilty.
Here are some of the men, institutions and newspapers who are characterized as opposing ths Examiner because they are "criminals."

The cripples and the Dutch, began this
week's series yesterday at Recreation
grounds and as usual the cripples run
second. In reality Bwings "Old "World",
aggregation should have taken the spoils,
but their six errors, especially when made
at critical periods, were enough to beat
almost any team. "Whalen and Schmidt
did the pitching and both were found fre-i
quently. Whalen allowed the IHides
eleven safe ones, \u25a0while the Wasps se
cured nine from Schmidt. The heat
6eemed too much for the players, as they
lacked life and spirit. The score:

NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â Tim Murphy, the
Western 'turf plunger, was officially de
nominated a welcher to-day by the Metro
politan Bookmakers' Association. Mur
phy's liabilities to" the betting ring, all
contracted during the past fortnight, ex
ceed $25,000. Every bookmaker in the ring
suffered by the plunger's delinquency, as
his credit was unquestioned.
During the late Gravesend meeting
Murphy gambled recklessly and lost in
cash wagers in a single week a sum esti
mated at $50,000 before he began to bet
the markers he owes. His disappearance
October 1 occasioned no suspicion. He
took French leave that day, and the first
intimation of his flight came through tel
eE rams to his creditors, dated at Chicago,
a==uring them he would return and meet
his obligations within forty-eight hours.
Nothing has been heard from him since,
and the bookmakers' association has list
ed him with Riley Grannan, Stedeker,
Charley Dwyer and other plungers who
have welched tor thousands within the
last few years. . A . ......*
Murphy was one of the heaviest bettors
in California last winter. He was sup
nosed to have gathered a competence dur
ing the years he has been battling against
betting rings all over, the country. He
could have easily defaulted for five times
the sum he owes, and from this fact his
creditors drew the logical comfort that he
will ultimately settle. .
The heaviest losers by Murphy's de
campment are George Rose $1800, Frank
Kckert $1200, Bill Jackman $1000, Leo
Maver $1500, George Wheelock $2000, Eddie
Burke $2500 and Sol Lichtenstein $2000.
Murphy belongs to a prominent family
of turfmen from St. Louis, and, with his
brothers, has teen a prominent figure in
the betting rings for the past decade.

PLUNGER MURPHY
OWES THOUSANDS
RESENTED BY SAMPSON.
His Counsel Call Attention to Charges
Against the Admiral.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â William H. Stay
ton, the New York attorney who some time
ago asked to be allowed to represent Rear Ad
miral Sampson before the \u25a0 Schley court of in
quiry, and whose request was denied by the
court, to-day presented the following letter to
the court:
NAVY YARD. WASHINGTON. D. C, Oct.
10, 1901.â To Admiral George Dewey, U. S. N.,
President Naval Court of Inquiry, Washington,
D. Câ Sir: I am instructed by Rear Admiral
Sampson to acknowledge for him the receipt of
your letter of the 27th of September, 1901, sta
ting the court does not at this time regard him
as a party to the case now before It, and is.
therefore, unable to comply with hia request
that he be permitted to representation by
counsel. .
' 2. . I am further instructed by the admiral
to ask that whenever the circumstances arise,
which entitle him to representation, you will
permit our admission as counsel In his behalf.
3. Mr. E. S. Theall of Washington, D. C,
who is ray associate In this matter, and my
self have been present in the courtroom of the
procedure, and one or both of us will endaavor
to be present every day hereafter.
4. We have not had facilities which would
permit us to hear the proceedings, but we have
been furnished with copies of the court's record,
and beg leave to refer respectfully to certain
pages of that record, which contain attacks
upon Admiral Sampson.
6. Rear Admiral Schley, for instance, was
permitted to say (see page 7) that "the prin
cipal parties to the present issue are Rear Ad
mirals Sampson and Schley."
6. Direct allegations have been made against
Admiral Sampson and we ask the court to re
fer to pages 152 to 156 of the record, where coun
sel repeatedly accuse Admiral Sampsonâ first,
of conducting a blockade "with his vessels at a
distance as great as t'hat-'-whlch was selected
by Admiral . Schley for his blockade; and, ' sec
ond, of .permitting the Colon to remain for an
Indefinite time after his arrival in full sight
of his squadron without making an effort to
destroy her.
7. On page 23 of the record counsel was al
lowed \u25a0 to declare that despite Admiral Samp
son's official report, In which he Etates that
the battle on July 3 was fought under his com
mand, and that as a matter of fact Admiral
Sampson did not command on that day, and
effort was made by counsel in yesterday's pro
ceedings to Introduce Into evidence a signal
made 'by Admiral Samoson which counsel
stated In his argument was Intended to show
that Rear Admiral Schley was commander In
chief of that battle. Surely these allegations
involve the honor of a naval officer,
' 8. The court's precept states that an officer
who is Interested may be permitted to appear
and defend himself, and while we fully realize
that Admiral Sampson is not a party to the
case, as the court ' states in Its letter of the
27th of September, yet notice has been given
that an effort will be made to deprive him of
his honors and even of his honor and his good
name, and he is accused of permitting an
enemy's vessel to lie undisturbed in his pres
ence, and all that as a naval officer he holds
dear Is involved, and we ask you to decide
merely that he !\u25a0 "interested."
9. It Is true that the attacks upon Admiral
Sampson have been made covertly and under
the name of argument, but the statements
have been, nevertheless, public; they have been
given great currency and they are embodid
In the record to remain forever on the flies
of the Navy Department. It Is at least worthy
of comment that on every occasion in which
such an argument has been indulged in, the
question at issue has been voluntarily with
drawn, after full opportunity had been taken
to accuse the admiral.
10. Were we alone In our opinion that these
arguments are improper, we should hesitate*
to make such statements, but the Judicial of
ficer of the courtâ the judge advocateâ has re
peatedly characterized these arguments as im
proper.
11. We of course realize fully that the In
tervention of new Issues and new parties might
be improperly used to cumber the record and
prolong the trial; but counsel are entirely un
der the control of the court and may always
be suitably restricted. We therefore request
that we now be permitted to appear before
the court and given facilities which will en
able us to hear the procedure and be present
to defend Rear Admiral Sampson when coun
sel shall make upon him attacks of the nature
which they have already deemed proper to
make. Very respectfully, .
WILLIAM H. STAYTON.
The court replied as follows:
The court has received and considered your
letter of this date In which you again request
that you be permitted to appear before the
court as counsel for Rear Admiral Sampson
and given facilities which will enable you to
hear the procedure and to defend that officer
from attack when necessary.
In reply I have to state that while the pre
cept convening this court gives It authority to
permit any person whom It may regard as con
cerned in the Investigation to be present for the
purpose of cross-examining witnesses and offer
ing evidence the court considers that Rear Ad
miral Sampson is not an Interested party in
the case now before It and is not, therefore en
titled to appear as such, either in person o'r bv
counsel, and you are further informed that If
circumstances arise which, in the opinion of
the court, render it necessary f or Admfrnl
Sampson to be . represented, due notice will hÂ«Â»
sent him. Very respectfully.

WASHINGTON. Oct. lO.-Just
before the Schley Court of In
quiry adjourned to-day Jucrge
Advocate Lemly introduced
Lieutenant J. H. Holden, for
merly watch officer of the Scorpion, as a
witness. Lieutenant Holden signed the
entry in the Scorpion's log griving the par
ticulars of the receipt of a message from
Commodore Schley from the Eagle, which
that vessel had brought from Captain Mc-
Calla on May 19. 1S98. when the flying
squadron, then bound for Cienfuegos/ fell
in with Captain ' McCalla' s sub-squadron,
which had just left that port.
The Government had sought to show
that by this message Commodore Schley
had been notified that the Spanish fleet
was not in the harbor of Cienfuegos and
Lieutenant Commander Southerland of
the Eagle had testified that he had mega
phoned to the Scorpion that there were
only a torpedo boat and several canoneros
in that harbor.
Other witnesses of the day were Lieu
tenant Commander W. H. Schuetze, who
served on the Iowa, and Lieutenant A. F.
Grant, who was on the Massachusetts,
who testified concerning- the general cam
paign of the flying squadron. Lieutenant
Edward P. Leiper concluded his testi
mony, begun yesterday.
TESTIJÂ£OK-y OF OFFICERS.
Movements of the Warships Ex
plained at Court of Inquiry.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 10.â The Schley na\-al
court of inquiry began business at 11 o'clock
to-day with the recall of yesterday's witnesses
lor the correction of their testimony and the
addition of such points as might have sug
gested themselves since their retirement from
the witness stand. These were Admiral Tay
lor. Lieutenant Commander Potts and Lieu
tenant Bristol. They were followed by Lieu
tenant Edward F. Leiper. who had begun his
testimony, but not concluded it, when the
court adjourned for the day.
The new -witnesses on the list for to-day In
cluded Lieutenant Commander Schuetze. who
was -on the Iowa in the Santiago campaign,
Lieutenant A. W. Grant, who was on the
Massachusetts. Lieutenant Commander C. C
Marsh and Lieutenant E. L. Bennett, both of
whom were on the Xew York, and Lieutenant
J. K. Holden, who was on the Scorpion. Cap
tain Chadwick, who was in direct command
of Admiral Sampson's flagship, the New York,
and who was the admiral's chief of staff dur
ing the war, was also expected to arrive during
the day and to give .testimony, especially con
cerning the sending of dispatches from Key
West to Commodore Schley when he lay off
Cynfuegos from Slay 22 to May 24.
Captain Cook, who occupied the same relative
position toward Commodore Schley that Cap
tain Chadwick occupied toward Admiral Samp-
Fcn, was also present in the courtroom during
the day. but he is not expected to testify until
Admiral Schley begins to present his side of
the case, he being one of the most prominent
of the admiral's witnesses.
Assistant Judge Advocate Hanna was not
present in the courtroom to-day. He was de
tained at his home by illness and the entire
presentation of the case on behalf of the Gov
ernment was conducted by Judge Advocate
Lemly.
Captain Parker of counsel for Admiral Schley
also was absent, having gone to his home in
New Jersey.
lieutenant Leiper Questioned.
Captain l*mly resumed the questioning of
Lieutenant Leiper by asking him concerning
the blockade of Santiago by Commodore Schlev.
The witness eaid that when the New Orleans
Joined the blockade the vessels were lying in
column from six to eight miles off shore, a
little to the eastward of directly south of the
Biouth of the harbor. AJ night they steamed
â¢lowly back and forth in front of the harbor
fcK 1 yards apart. They were so far out, the
witness said, that it was impossible to dis
tinguish points on the shore or to determine
where the ehore line met the water line. He
could distinguish the vessel nearest to him
ehead.
On the first night of the blockade he had
not been able to distinguish the Brooklyn and
the Vixen. The Marblehead and Vixen had
occupied places between the blockade line and
the Fhore. but he had not been able to dis
tinguish them. Practically the distance of the
main vessels from the shore line was the same
in the day as at night. He could not say how
tar east or west of the mouth of the harbor
the flewt had steamed, as he could not see the
harbor.
On cross-examination Mr. Raynor called the
attention of the witness to the statement of
Captain Folger. who had been in command of
the New Orleans, that the fleet was nearer to
the shore at night than in the day time, and
asked whether he agreed with his commanding
officer. The witness replied:
"As a fleet or squadron I do not agree that
they rr.oved closer to the shore at night. I
have an Indistinct recollection that the Xew
Orleans the first evening was lying a little far
ther off shore than the Brooklyn. When the
Brooklyn took up her course east the New Or
leans had to go in probably a quarter or pos
sibly half a mile to get her position in the
rp2r of the Brooklyn, but it was no more than
that. It was simply to stand in. It may have
been that that gave the captain the impression
that we were closer In at night."
Mr. Raynor called attention to the fact that
the log of the New Orleans placed the dis
tance of that vessel from the Morro at four
r.r.d a ha!f miles, and the witness said this
vas true.
Lieutenant Leiper said In further reply to
"Does that entry In the log embody all that
was communicated to the Brooklyn?"
"To the best of my knowledge and belief it
does."
"Who did receive the message?"
"The commanding officer, Lieutenant Com
mander Marix."
"Was there any difficulty 'in receiving it, so
far as you know, on account of the distance?"
"There was considerable difficulty in receiv
ing. It on account of the distance between the
ships and the wind, which was blowing from
us toward the Eagle. The commanding officer
had the megaphone, and in receiving the mes
sage held it up to his ear and' was thus able
to hear more than other people /from the bridge
at that time."
Mr. Kaynorâ How far was the Eagle from
the Scorpion when she megaphoned?
"The distance varied. I should say the dis
tance ranged between one and two hundred
yards."
Mr. Raynorâ Was the Eagle bo close to the
Scorpion that she had to back off for fear of a
collision?
"I don't recollect that she was so close that
there, was imminent danger of a collision."
Lieutenant Commander Southerland stated in
response to the question: "Do you recollect
about how far your vessel was when you mega
phoned? 'So near I had to back off for fear of
a collision, which made a little confusion for"
the time being.' .You don't think you were so
near as to be in danger of collision?"'/
"Mo, sir."
Captain Lemlyâ Do you remember the vessel
backins?
"I don't recollect the Scorpion's backing."
"Do you recollect whether you saw the Eagle
backing:?"
"I don't recollect seeing her back, but she
probably backed, as we had to slow down and
stop more suddenly than we ordinarily would
continuing under way."
The court then adjourned until to-morrow.

Judge Advocate Lemly Con

at Schley Court of Inquiry
and the attention we were paying to our own
ship in that fight"
Commander Schuetze was then excused and
Lieutenant Commander Albert W. Grant, who
was senior watch officer on the Massachusetts
during the war with Spain, was called.
Asked by Captain Lemly concerning the
blockade of Cienfuegos, Commander Grant said
there were no directions giving an order of
battle, but there was upon arrival a signal
from the flagship that Cienfuegos was to be
blockaded. He had on the occasion of the
maneuver off Cienfuegos seen the Spanish
earthworks there and the masts of one vessel
lying in the harbor, but nothing to his knowl
edge had been done to destroy those works.
Commander Grant said that' he remembered
a signal from the Brooklyn before starting for
Cienfuegcs saying the fleet was bound for
Santiago and would rendezvous at Gonaives
Bay. The progress on that cruise was, he said,
slow, because the smaller vessels were affected
by the weather. He said that on the first
night out from Cienfuegos a suspicious vessel
which had erroneously been supposed to be
long to the enemy, had been sighted. The
Brooklyn, which had been steaming just In
front of the Massachusetts, changed its course
and turned to port. The witness said that as
soon as he observed this maneuver he turned
the Massachusetts so as to protect the ship
following."
"Then," he said, "as I knew I was going to
clear the Brooklyn I went ahead with port
engine full speed and shifted the helm and
gave the whistle signal."
"Were the ships in formation of column?"
Captain Lemly asked.
The witness replied: "They were not. There
\u25a0was a mix-up."
Tlie Retrograde JEo^ment.
Commander Grant then told about the retro
grade movement of the tiylng squadron toward
Key West as well as the blockade of Santiago.
He also described the bombardment of the
Colon on May 31 and said that on that oc
casion he had no conversation with Admiral
Schley.
"Have you stated all or did you understand
that I want all that the commodore may have
said within your hearing in relation to this
battle on that day?"
"I wa B only in Commodore Schley"s presence
once and that was when he went over the side
after the firing was over. I heard these words,
that the reconnoissance had developed the bat
teries and he was satisfied, or words to that
effect."
Mr. Raynor questioned the witness concern-
Ing the signals of May. 28, with the end In view
of showing that Commodore Schley' s signal at
4:30 p. m., saying that "the general meeting
place will be twenty-five miles south of San
tiago," was modified by the preceding signal
of 11:30 a. m., saying, "In case of separation
the fleet will rendezvous at place designated
by sitrnal." v
The witness declined to admit that this was
true, calling attention to the fact that the
11:30 signal also specified the latitude and longi
tude of Gonaives Bay, showing, as he heid,
that that signal referred to a former \ signal
and that the 4:30 signal for a rendezvous twen
ty-five miles south of Santiago was Independent
and was not modified.
Mr. Raynor questioned the witness concern
ing the encounter with a suspicious vessel
while en route to Santiago.
"You say there was a melee or mix-up on
the night of the 2oth. That was the time you
were on your way from Cienfuegos to San
tiago. Is there anything In your log book about
that?"
"I do not think so, but next morning I made
a written statement to Captain Hlgginson. I
am very sorry I have not a copy pf the letter
I wrote at that time."
The court asked the following questions:
"Were any efforts made by the flying squad
ron to discover whether or not Cervera's squad
ron was In the harbor of CienfueKOs?"
"None to my knowledge."
"Were any orders given from the flagship
by signal or otherwise for the guidance of the
ships composing the flying squadron In the
event of meeting Cervera's squadron in the
passage from Cienfuegos to Santiago?"
"None to my knowledse."
Commander Grant was then excused and
Lieutenant J. H. Holden, who was watch officer
on the Scorpion during the Spanish war, was
called.
Captain Lemly only asked Lieutenant Holden
concerning the Scorpion's mission as a dispatch
boat from Commodore Schley to the Harvard
off Santiago on May 22, He then stated that
Lieutenant Holden was the writer of the log
of the Scorpion in which an entry was made
concerning the message conveyed to Commodore
Schley through the Eagle and the Scorpion
from Captain McCalla. when the flying squad
ron was en route to Cienfuegos.
Message to the Scorpion.
Mr. Raynor then addressed the court, quoting
the message which Lieutenant Commander
Southerland, in command of the Eagle, testi
fied he had megaphoned to the Scorpion on May
19 in order to intercept the Eagle. This mes
sage, as the lieutenant commander gave it,
read :
"We left Cienfuegos on the night of the 16th,
at which time, as we learned from an insur
gent camp about thirteen miles to the westward
of Cienfuegos. some of the people from which
were inside the town every night, that the only
vessels in that harbor were a torpedo boat and
nine canoneros."
Mr. Raynor then inquired of Captain Lemly
whether Commander Marix, who commanded
the Scorpion, was not now In Manila. Without
immediately replying to this Captain Leraly
said:
"I believe that Lieutenant Commander South
erland is right in his statement as to the mes
sage he communicated to the Scorpion, but it
Is like any other case of communicating through
personsâ there is a disagreement between the
log of the Scorpion, which I have before me,
and Mr. Southerland's statement, and we are
not able to carry that message, which was de
livered to the Scorpion, to Commodore Schley
on board the Brooklyn in our evidence. Marix
is at Cavite. I have every reason to believe,
there would be a disagreement between Marix
and Southerland If Marix were summoned fi-om
this great distajice, and we are prepared to ad
mit that if he were summoned he would not
say that communication had been made to the
Brooklyn as to the presence of the insurgents
with whom communication had been had near
Cienfuegos."
Reading from the log. Captain Lemly quoted
the entry from 8 a. nT. to meridian for May
19, showing that the Brooklyn had instructed
the Scorpion to "speak the Eagle and obtain
news and the names of the vessels off Clen
fuejos."
The entry then proceeds to tell of the carry
ing out of the order and reports the following
as being the message signaled to the Brooklyn
by the Scorpion as the result of the interview
with the Easle:
"Eagle sent by McCalla from Cienfuegos to
report. Nashville following about twenty-five
miles in rear to westward. Starboard hitrh
pressure cylinder disabled. Proceed slowlv
Cincinnati and Vesuvius off Cape San Antonio!
about fifteen miles to northward. Flying squad
ron has left Cienfuegos for Key West. No
news of the Spanish."
Mr. Raynorâ Are you able to state what
Lieutenant Commander Marix would testify to
before the court if he were here?
Captain Lemlvâ I. have it in the shape of a
cablegram and letter, neither of which is
properly evidence before the court, because it
is not sworn to.
Mr. Raynorâ I will agree to accept that let
ter and cablegram. I do not know what is in
either of them.
Captain Lemlyâ I am perfectly willing the
court should have them.
The cablegram and letter were then read
as was Assistant Secretary Hackett's cable
gram requesting the information. The Secre
tary's cablegram was as follows:
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 11. 1901.â Rem'ey,
Manila: See Marix and obtain a correct state
ment of information communicated through
Eagle. May 19. Did he communicate informa
tion Schley? Give date of. All messages to
be in cipher. HACKETT."
Statement From Marix.
The cable received in reply was as follows:
(Translation:)
"CAVITE. P. I.. Aug. 14, 1901.â Secretary
Navy, Washington: Referring â¢ telegram Au
gust 11, Marix has deposed as follows:
" "The message communicated to the com
mander of Eagle, May 19, was to Schley from
McCalla to the effect that before leaving Cien
fuegos with his ships did not believe Spanish
ships had arrived there when Marblehead left.
The message was communicated to Brooklyn
and Scorpion by hail.' REMEY."
The letter which followed, and which con
firmed the cablegram, read:
"Office of the commander-in-chlef, United
States naval force on Asiatic station, August
13, 1901.
"Remey, Manila: Commander Adolph Marix,
U. S. N.i deposes as follows:
" 'The message communicated by the com
manding officer of the Eagle, May 19, was from
McCalla to Schley to the effect that McCalla
had left Cienfuegos with his ships and did
not believe that Cervera's fleet had arrived
there when Marblehead left. This message
was communicated to Scorpion and Brooklyn
by hailing.
" 'I do hereby swear the foregoing to be a
true statement.
A. MARIX. Commander, U. S. N.'
"Sworn and subscribed to before me this 13th
day of August, 1901, on board United States
flagship Brooklyn.
"GEORGE C. REMEY,
"Commander-in-Chief, United States Naval
Forces. Naval Station."
Mr. Raynor then presented the Scorpion's
log containing the entry covering the meeting
with the Eagle, and Mr. Holden eald that- it
was correct, according to his best knowledge
and belief.
Captain Lemlyâ I ask if you are quite posi
tive nothing else was communicated to the
vessel at this time which you may have omitted
from this entry in the log book? ,
"1 did not conduct the megaphone message."
"Did you hear it?"
"I did not hear all of It; only parts of it."
"You mean you did not hear all of it as re
ceived on board the Scorpion V
"I did not."
"Did you hear all that was communicated to
the Brooklyn T" Â« , /
"I did." " ) â¢ \u25a0 â¢ ..__
questions that his estimate of the distance
out was entirely due to visual observation.
Asked whether ho agreed with Captain Folger
in stating that the reconnolssancc of May 31,
when the Colon was bombarded, was a success
in developing the strength and number of the
shore batteries, the \u25a0 witness replied that â¢ he
thought it had been a success to that extent,
but that he could not agree with Captain Fol
ger in all that he had said. He found that the
lire of the batteries was slow. He also found
that the greatest caliber probably was a 6
inch gun on the Zocapa battery; that there
appeared to be only two or three guns there,
not of that caliber; that on the. battery east
of the Morro there appeared to be- four or five
guns fired, and "from the volume of smoke
and the range attained it appeared to me that
they were light guns, less than 6-inch in cal
iber."
"Batteries Were Weak."
The Judge advocate asked:
"What, really, as a matter of fact, was de
veloped^ by the affair of May 31, as to tha
strength or weakness of guns?" !
The witness replied:
"As compared with the strength of the ships
of the squadron, or as compared with the
strength of the guns of any ship in the squad
ron, any of the battleships, the Brooklyn, New
Orleans or the Marblehead. the batteries were
weak."
Lieutenant Commander William H. Schuetze,
who, as lieutenant, was the navigator of the
battleship Iowa during the summer of 1858,
and who is now superintendent of compasses
in the Xavy Department, was the next wit
ness. He was a member of the board of nav
igation which prepared the official chart of
the positions of the vessels engaged on both
sides in the battle of July 3, and Judge Advo
cate Lemly asked him concerning the report
made by that board, which accompanied the
chart. The witness eaid he had not been sat
isfied with the report.
"I protested," he said, "against signing the
report, as being Inaccurate, but I was finally
persuaded to ao so by the senior member of
the board, Commander Wainwright, who
thought that was the best we could do, even
if we stayed there until doomsday, and I
signed it undsr protest. My tirst objection was
that the chart was inaccurate; that the posi
tion of the Iowa, as platted on his chart,
gave her too much speed. In order to keep
the Iowa in relative position to the other ships
for certain distances, she approximately ap
peared to be making eighteen knots, when she
was making nine or ten. Another objection I
had was the initial position of the Brooklyn
when 'the Spaniards first left the harbor. I
contended that the Brooklyn's position was too
close to the mouth of the harbor; that she
was not in her regular position. She was south
of it. I based that opinion upon the fact that
when I first discovered the Spaniards coming
out of the harbor I looked over toward the
ether ships on our left and the Brooklyn was
very neariy abeam of the Iowa. The Iowa
was heading north, directly into the harbor."
Commander Schuetze was asked In regard to
his observations of the Brooklyn In the battle
of July 3. He replied:
Action of the Brooklyn.
"I saw the Brooklyn at the beginning of the
action about port abeam of the Iowa. I saw
her some minutes afterward, when she ap
peared to be headed a little to the eastward
of north. It is difficult to tell, because she
was very nearly broadside-on. Soon afterwa'rd
I saw her headed to the eastward, about due
cast. I should say. That is the last I saw of
her."
Captain Lemlyâ I want you to state whether
you saw the Texas about this time. How was
she located, relative to the Brooklyn? Did you
notice anything particularly as to the speed or
maneuvering of the Texas?
"When I first saw the Texas she was headed
to the eastward of north. Soon afterward I
noticed her again and she was headed to the
westward and apparently lying dead in the
water. I called Captain Evans' attention to
the fact that she was in our way; that she was
lying dead in the water, and cautioned the
captain that we would probably run Into her
if we kept on the way we were heading. She
was then on our port bow. We were trying to
get close into the harbor and steamed at first
directly for the mouth of the harbor. As the
Spaniards turned to the westward we turned
in the same direction and in this maneuver
ing we were hindered by the Texas."
Captain Lemly â It is In evidence here that
the Brooklyn crossed the bow of the Texas.
Have you any personal knowledge of that?
"No. sir."
On cross-examination Mr. Raynor questioned
the witness in reference to the official chart
of the position of the .various ships in the
battle off Santiago.
"Why did not you state. 'This chart is wrong
and I won't sign?' "
"I did."
"Then." why did you sign?"
"Because I was persuaded by the other mem
bers of the board that was the best we could
do and they wanted to come to an agreement.
That vras a compromise."
"Then really this chart was signed for the
purpose of coming to an agreement and not
for the purpose of showing any accurate re
sults, was it?"
"The board \u25a0was ordered to show accurate
results, but It was an absolute impossibility
to make a chart of that kind showing accurate
results. It was the best we could do so long
after the battle."
Questions by the Court.
The court put a number of questions to the
witness.
By the courtâ Was your position during the
battle of July 3 such as to enable you to ob
serve clearly the relative positions and move- #
ments of the different ships?"
"No, sir. I never observed the relative posi
tions of all the ships on account of the smoke
"How did you determine the distance of the
Iowa from the shore while blockading Cienfue
gos?"
"We did not determine the distance at all.
except simply by bearings occasionally. There
was not any regular effort made to obtain
any particular position."
"Were the vessels nearer to or farther from
shore at night at Santiago?"
"At what time of the blockade?"
Captain Lemly â Prior to the 1st of June.
"About the same distance day and night Is
my recollection, about eight miles."
When the court reconvened after luncheon
Lieutenant Commander Schuetze continued his
testimony. In response to a question by the
court he that he had determined the
position of the Iowa at 7:40 a. m. on May
28, and that its distance out was seven miles.
He also said that the bombardment of May
31 had developed that the Spanish shore bat
teries were extremely weak. He had seen no
evidence of a disposition on the part of any
of Cervera's ships to ram any of the American
vessels.

One of the curious features of the municipal cam
paign in New York is that each side is loudly as
serting that the triumph of the other would convert
j that city into "a second Phifadelphia."
For the purpose of,. obtaining .direct Information as
to the proper method of pronouncing Roosevelt's
name the Boston Transcript wrote to the President
and received from his secretary the reply that the
name should be pronounced as if spelled "Rosyvelt."
THE Colusa Sun makes note* of a letter written
by Mr. Crosette, an old California journalist, to
the effect that in the East, quite generally, it is
believed that Southern California, meaning that part
of the State below the Tchachapi Pass, is all there is
of this State. In the East it is believed, he says,
that to that section are confined our climate, our
fruits, our productive capacity, our commercial en
terprise and prospects, and, in effect, all the material
elements that make a State.
We can add our testimony to that of Mr. Crosette
that this ir the case, and congratulate' Southern Cali
fornia upon the generality of its excellent advertise
ment as the whole thing.
If this Eastern opinion were true it would be glory
enough to make a State to have such a section as
Southern California, so in the long run the State is
not much out and injured by the error. The harm is
done to the many who desire to seek homes here and
leave that desire unsatisfied because they look at
the map and refrain from seeking what they want in
a State that has so small a desirable area as Southern
California. It becomes the duty of all public-spirited
media of information, therefore, to stand for pan-
California. No section has any monopoly of our
justly celebrated climate. Physically the State is
beautiful and equally productive of the same articles
of luxury and necessity throughout its entire nine
hundred miles of length, and the same sun kisses it
into blushing with the same fruits and flowers from
border to border". The ascription of peculiar quali
ties to Southern California did not originate with
old Californians. It was put in action for pelfish
purposes by the great company of Eastern real estate
agents, who staked* Southern California off in town
lots and boomed the great speculation which for a
time rivaled the Mississippi scheme of John Law,
or the moms multicaulus speculation, which was to
dress every American in home-grown silk. If was
these Eastern real estate experts who used to tell
"tenderfeet that San Francisco Bay froze solid every
winter, and that ice and snow locked all life in cold
storage in Northern California for half of every year.
It was speculative fibbing, but it left a deep impres
sion, upon which the Eastern error complained of is
based to this day. .
Mr. Crosette advises a Northern California move
ment to enlighten Eastern opinion, but we demur to
that. What is wanted^ is a pan-California movement,
in which north and south will cordially, join, to do
justice to the whole State. , In the State Board of
Trade this plan will be found already in action.
There the whole State, from Los Angeles to the Sis
kiyous, is represented. The products, maps and
statistics of every county are kept for distribution,
and exact justice is done to every section. If that
plan have put into' it the exquisite enterprise which
has characterized Southern California every section
will be benefited and the prosperity of the State in
creased.
The whole State is like a perfectly beautiful woman.
But if the beauties of such a woman are divided, and
one is asked to be enraptured over her dissected
eyes, or amputated nose, or shorn hair, rapture does
not report for duty. So it is with California. To
be appreciated her beauties and resources must "be'
exhibited as a whole, as the most * inspiring . and
illuminating unit that nature has ever produced. So
exhibited to the unfortunate people whose lot has
been cast elsewhere, they will hasten hither, with
their household gods and their enterprise and indus-,
try, and the whole State will make â¢ their coming
profitable to them and will benefit by their prosperity.

. The one danger to be feared now is that for one
reason or another the movement may be permitted
to drag until its original impulse is largely lost. The
bad results of delay in a cause' of this kind were strik
ingly shown in the history of the movement started
to erect a monumental tomb for Grant in New York,
That work;was eventually, accomplished in a majestic
manner, and the tomb is now the greatest structure
of its kind, in the world; but so long were the New
Yorkers engaged in raising money for it that at times
it seemed as if. the monument would never be com
pleted at all. Let us do things more promptly. Be
fore the holidays come we ought to have in the
memorial fund a sum large enough , to justify the
committee in beginning to get plans for the monu
ment, so that within a reasonable time we. may see
the work completed ?nd standing as an ornament to
our city, and a proof o? the patriotic liberality of our
Among those that are now reasonably certain of
ultimate success is the movement started in San
Francisco. The contributions already made to the
fund give ample assurance of coming success. It ; is
gratifying, moreover, that most ' of the donations
have come in comparatively small amounts, showing
that the movement is supported, by the people as a
whole, and that when the memorial is completed it
will in the truest sense represent the popular heart
of San Francisco.
DURING the week that followed the death of
President' McKinley there were started for
the erection of a memorial to him almost as
many movements as there are cities in the United
States. Even .a considerable number of compara
tively small towns undertook some such enterprise.
Certainly there is not a State in the Union that did
hot have one or more of them.
These movements were the natural results of the
sorrow of the people, and there is nothing to be said
against any of them. It is inevitable, however, that
most of them should die away and be heard of no
more. Only a few of them will live to go forward to
the accomplishment of such memorials as will attest
to future generations the love which to-day the
American people feel for the great statesman so
cruelly murdered while in the administration 'of his
high office.

DUNDEE, Scotland, has just unveiled a monu
: ment erected to the memory oLJames Bow
man Lindsay, who his fellow citizens proudly
claim to have been the world's pioneer in applying
electricity to the uses of mankind. It is said of him
that he anticipated by half a century not only elec
tric lighting and electric power distribution, but wire
less telegraphy as well.
In a brief biographical sketch of Lindsay given in
the London Chronicle it is stated that in 1834 he
promulgated his views of electric energy and its util
ity, and made experiments in sending messages
across the Tay without wires. In the same year he
went to London and submitted his theories and his
experiments to the British Association, but nothing
resulted from the visit. One of the scientists of that
time who served on the committee appointed to in
vestigate Lindsay's inventions is still living, and in
explanation of the failure to profit by them recently
said that there was in 1834 no demand for such ap
pliances. He went on to argue that an invention to
be of service must be produced at the appropriate
moment. If it be premature it is useless. Lindsay
had the misfortune to be ahead of his time. Instead
of being hailed by the whole civilized world as Mar
coni is to-day, and gaining honors and being en
riched by his invention,, he died obscure and gets
nothing but a monument in his native town.
The fortune of the Scottish inventor is by no means
singular. Many a supposed new invention of our
time is but a revival of something that was known
ages ago but was. useless in the civilization that then'
prevailed. Of course any credit given to Lindsay by
no means. .detracts \u25a0from the honor due to Marconi.
There is. no evidence that the experiments of 1834,
resulted in anything which would be of practical
value- even, now. Lindsay managed to strike out
theories that- were far in advance of his time, but
Marconi, in competition with hundreds of the
brightest scientists and mechanical inventors, has
been first to devise a system of wireless telegraphy
that meets the need of his age and is practically val
uable.' It is, in fact, the achievement of Marconi
that has been the occasion of the erection of the
monument to Lindsay. The Scotchman and his in-,
ventions were forgotten even in his own land until
the marvels wrought by the young Italian- revived an
interest in the bygone experimenter and made! his
townsmen feel that something of honor is due tq v the
memory of the man \vhq fifty years ago did in some

is about 2500 Fahrenheit. The body is ra
duced to ashes in from an hour and a half
to two hours. The coffin, with the excep
tion of the glass and trimmings, is incin
erated with the body, except in the case
of metallic caskets, then the body is re
moved from the casket. There is no odor
while the body is being consumed. When

on the carriage just before being sent into
the furnace it is covered with an alum
soaked cloth, so that it may not catch
fire while being transferred to the fur
nace. Within three minutes after the cas

destroy the world. God will then make his children

way" for a time and opened more bottles
than even the very hot day provoked.
The ride over the new road was the busi
ness of the celebration. The lunch at
California City was the entertainment.
Both were successful.
The line of rolling carriers was a long
one. The men in them made a jolly party
and after-the day's pleasure was over the

Picturesque Driveway.
This new read improvement of the
county winds round curves and corners
and affords both picturesque and comr
fortable drives. It has been building for
more than two years and represents the
work of many public-spirited, men of the
county. And these men had a chance to
tell of their labors for tne new improve-
The road as it is now is in splendid con

reaches almost a state of perfection.
Without any question, this improvement
will be of inestimable value to the county.

SCENES AT THE L.UXCH AND
ALONG THE ROAD FROM TIBU
RON TO CALIFORNIA CITY.
It will be seen that while most of these might be
fairly called \u25a0conservative, there are several of them
that go" as far as the Populists themselves ever went.
The call for protection to individual rights against
"monopolistic power,", the assertion that the "com
munism of capital" must be met by State control,
the denunciation of the United States Senate as a
"dangerous oligarchy," may seem to Mr. Quincy to
be conservative phrases, but to the country at large
they will sound very much like the old Bryan clamors
against corporations and the rich. In what way
monopolistic power is crushing individual rights in
Massachusetts is more than we know, and as Mr.
Quincy intends it strictly as a State issue perhaps it
is no concern to Californians; but none the less it
is interesting as an illustration of the kind of platform
on which the Democrats are uniting. It would seem
that Williams was not far wrong when he declared
the party still breathes the spirit of the Bryanite con
vention of 1806. .
17. A constitutional convention should be held,
15. Metropolitan commissions should be reorganized
to represent the people and taxpayers of the metropoli
tan district.
f " 16. Boston harbor must be at once improved, by State
action if necessary.
4. Every branch of State government should be a de
partment; the head of every department should repre
sent it upon the floor of the Legislature. *
5. The gTOwing evil of special legislation must be
abated.
6. Legislative sessions should be curtailed.
7. Legislative measures should be subject to referen
dum to the people whenever duly petitioned for. .
8. A single primary election for all parties should be
established in place of separate caucuses. , . >
9. All candidates voted for in districts should be nom
inated by direct vote; optional direct nomination of can
didates for State offices should be provided for.
10. The United States Senate is becoming a danger
ous oligarchy; Senators should be nominated and elected
by direct vote of the people.
' 11. The, suffrage is a duty, â¢ not merely a privilege;
compulsory voting is desirable.
, 12. Progressive labor legislation should be revived.
." 13. The right of home rule should be given to cities.
;PubUcownership of public utilities is demanded.
" ' 14. City"' governments should be given larger legisla
tive powers. \u25a0 ~t -â¢. \u25a0 , \u25a0;â¢:-\u25a0 \u25a0; ,\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0: . . â¢

3. A responsible Governor should be at the head of all
administration; the executive council should be abol
ished. - â¢
1. Individual rights must be safeguarded by law
against monopolistic power; communism of capital must
be met by State control. '
MASSACHUSETTS Democrats, it seems,
have, got togetherâ at least the Boston pa
pers agree that the convention manifested
something like a genuine harmony between the two
wings that were flapping against one another so vio
lently as long' as' Bryan was to the fore. Josiah
Quincy was nominated by. a. vote so overwhelming
that it was hardly worth while for the opponent to
move to make it unanimous, and so strong was the
sentiment of union that it was not disturbed even
when George Fred Williams declared: "The
Democracy of this country is absolutely pledged to
the essential policy and the spirit and soul that ani
mated the party in the convention of 1896. It cannot
be stirred, from that foundation."
It goes without saying that the platform adopted
by the convention set national aside. That
is an essential part of every harmony programme
known to Democracy in these days. It enables the
candidates to skip the silver question in their
speeches, ;;as well as every other national issue, and
thus greatly simplifies the process of bringing all the
elements of the party together. It is not to be sup
posed, however, that a Boston convention would set
those issues aside in the crude way in which the thing
was done in Ohio. A little more tact was displayed
and a finer diplomacy exhibited in removing Bryan
ism. The platform, says: "We believe that in the
present campaign attention, should be concentrated
chiefly upon our State government and State legis
lation; its paramount issues are those that relate to
domestic affairs. . In place of colonial imperialism
abroad we offer the people progressive democracy at
home."
In a public letter to which we directed attention
a few days ago Mr. Quincy, the candidate for Gov
ernor, declared that while Democracy would stand
for the laboring classes against capital, the party
should adopt a platform that would be acceptable to
conservatives. As he' was unquestionably consulted
in the framing of the platform, upon which he has
been nominated, it is interesting to note what he
regards as conservatism in the way of State reforms.
There are seventeen of these demands, and by the
chairman of the committee on platforms they were
thus stated in brief:
MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRACY.
Our .cartoons of Mr. Bryan were legitimate â¢ cam
paign material. He had provoked that style of
graphic argument by his own attacks upon his oppo
nents. He had called them "hogs" and said that his
mission was to put rings in their noses, so that they
could hot root: He hcd characterized a large section
of the republic as "the enemy's country," and by his
forcible pnd fantastic oratory had assumed positions
that were best answerable by ridicule, a weapon that
he often used himself. When told that many Gold
Democrats were following Richard Olney , in his
camp he said: "Had I known that so many were
coming 1 .would have had a large number of candy
fatted calves made with which to reward these re
turning prodigals." In countless instances he used'
the weapons of satire and ridicule in promoting his
political fortunes, and the same weapons were turned
against him, never in malice, but in humorous illus
tration of his peculiarities.
Between such campaign methods and the Exam
iner's steady, stealthy and: malign pursuit of Presi
dent McKinley there was all the difference between a
joke and a murder. He had been elected to a second
term by the largest popular majority ever given to a
candidate for that great office. Neither in his first
candidacy nor his second had he. ever offensively
characterized his opponents. After .his first election
his action was that of President of the whole people.
He invited the South to sit above the salt at the
national table, and commissioned Lee and Wheeler
and restored them to the place in the regular army,
they had resigned to fight for the Confederacy.
Never for a moment did his patience or his amiabil
ity disappear. The Democratic members of Congress
in .personal intercourse found him a considerate
friend, and his popularity with them was as great as
with his own party. In fine, he never said nor did a
partisan thing from his first nomination to the day
of his death to justify the malice with which he was
created by the Hearst papers, and they cannot excuse
nor soften their brutality by reprinting campaign pic
tures which we're humorously intended to reduce Mr.
Bryan's position to its ultimate absurdity.
After. . his second .election President McKinley's
career had a perspective of only four years. He could
not be chosen again. There was no good point nor
purpose in personally assailing and brutally abusing
him. .The Examiner attacks by cartoon and text
were not partisan nor political. They were entirely
personal, directed against the man and intended to
degrade him in the eyes of his countrymen and the
world. They were more than this. They repre
sented him as the enemy of the plain people, the
avaricious destroyer of their happiness, the greedy
robber of their substance, the foolish-minded tool of
their enemies. In all the history of cartoons, from
the days of Gillray to these days, there were never
such incitements to the murder of a man as lay in
the Examiner's pictures. In all the history of lam
poons from the .days of Cobbett there were nevef
printed such reckless, malicious, murder-provoking
lampoons as the Examiner editorials against the
President. Neither the "Cri du Peuple" nor any
other hysterical publication that preceded the French
Revolution ever exceeded the malign influence of the
Examiner against law, government and the rights of
person and property.
All this is of black record, and so black that it
may superimpose the ridicule of others in text and
picture a foot deep upon it, and the black purpose of
it will show through.
IN its efforts to prove some one else as bad as
.itself the Examiner, is quite frantic, and; as usual,
illogical. It is reproducing from The Call cam
paign cartoons of Mr. Bryan^ and tries to represent
them as the same in spirit and purpose as its own
lampoons and cartoons of "Willie and His Papa" and
"The McKinley Minstrels," published persistently
after the campaign was over and up to the very
morning of the day on which the President was shot.

Thief Takes $350 From
John Fitzpatrick
of Manila.
A stranger in the city was held up
Tuesday night in the shadow of the Hall
of Justice. John Fitzpatrick, a recent ar
rival from Manila, was the victim.
Fitzpatrick was drinking In a saloon on
Kearny street, near \Vashington,,when he
was accosted by a well dressed young
man, who informed / him that a woman
waa waiting outside to see him. Fitzpat
rick unsuspectingly walked out of the
saloon, followed by . the man who had
spoken to him. As he stood on the side
walk, anxiously looking for the woman
who waa supposed to be waiting for him'.
the stranger grabbed him by the throat
and after choking him" into insensibility
robbed him of his wallet, containing J350
in greenbacks. >
Notwithstanding the fact that at least
a' half . dozen ' people - witnessed the \u25a0 bold
crime, no attempt was made to apprehend
the robber. - ,. ..
As soon as Fitzpatrick recovered he
went to the Central police station and re
ported the robbery to the officer in charge.
Detectives Coleman and Crockett were at
once detailed on the case, but thus far
they have failed to get a trace of the rob
ber. â¢
: Fitzpatrick describes his assailant as
being about 2Â»> years of age, rather fash
ionably attired and wearing a small, light
mustache. He is satisfied that he will be
able to identify him in case he is arrested.

"Water Front Notes.
Captain Charles Seymour, who twice
nearly lost his life In Bering Sea, reached
here Wednesday on the steamer Dora.
The story of his narrow escapes was told
in The Call two weeks ago. Seymour was
captain of tbe schooner Imlama and with
a crew of three men he sailed for Unga.
At the latter place he paid off his men
and tied up the vessel. During a north
west gale the Imlama dragged her anchor
and went to sea, taking Seymour with
her. For two months and fifteen days the
Jittle boat was driven around Bering Sea
and finally went ashore about fifty miles
below Atka. All the provisions were lost,
but Seymour got ashore and for two
months and five days subsisted upon shell
fish and whatever birds he could snare.
Finally the Indians found him and car
ried him to Altak, where he caught the
schooner Challenge for Unalaska. At the
latter place he took the Dora for San
Francisco. While drif^ng around Bering-
Sea the British steamer Oopack spoke the
Imlama and offered to take Captain Sey
mour abcard. The latter would not leave
his vessel, however, and the Steamer
\u25a0would not tow her, so they parted com
pany. The Oopack brought the story to
Victoria. B. C, and from there it was
telegraphed to The Call.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, Oct. 10 (via
Haytian cable).â The British Royal Mall
steamer Eden arrived here to-day from
La Guaira. Venezuela, and brought the
following reliable story: -
Last Sunday night fifty sailors from the
German cruiser Vineta became engaged
in a street row at Porto Cabello with the
local populace. Police in civilian clothes
interfered, siding with the inhabitants,
and the fight became general, the Ger
mans makins their way toward the
whsrf, where' they boarded the German
steamer Valesia, moored at that place. In
the meantime two petty officers of the
Vineta, who were sober and who were
waiting at the wharf to take the Vineta's
boats, were attacked by the police. They
resisted and the police wounded them
badly with their swords. All the Ger
mans ashore were unarmed. The wound
ed petty officers were carried on board the
Va'.esia by members of the Valesia a
crew, the populace and police still attack
ing them with stones and sticks. The
mob then tried to board the Valesia, but
were' prevented from so doing by the cap
tain and crew of that vessel. In the
meantime the captain of the Valesia had
signaled to the Vineta, which was in the
harbor, the perilous condition of the Ger
mans, and the Vineta. sent a boatload of
thirty armed men to the Valesia, which
they boarded by the side opposite the
wharf, not landing on Venezuelan soil.
The mob, estimated to number 1200 per
sons, was still acting in a threatening
manner and fired a few shots. The com
mander of the Vineta's boat ordered his
men to perform the motions of loading,
but not to introduce cartridges into their
rifles. Hearing the rattling of the breeches
of the rifles the mob disappeared rapidly
in all directions.
Considerable excitement prevailed at
Porto Cabello when the Eden sailed.
It is said that the Venezuelan Govern
ment is putting the blame for the affair
upon the Germans and has requested ths
German Minister to apologize for the sail
ors' conduct. ' â
It is believed at Caracas that the Ger
man Minister intends to ask Venezuela to
apologize.

The railroad station. including the

The old canteen issue is revived in this
report through a substitute" sub-report
furnished by Inspector General Burton.
lie says that the exchange is a. great com
fort to the soldier in Cuba, who is de
prived ot many ot the comtorts Known to
him at home. The officers generally com
plain that the elimination ot beer from the
exchange has worked a hardship on the
soldier and has been detrimental to good
order and military discipline.
General Burton has some interesting
recommendations to submit, based upon
the experience of the American soldier in
Cuba. For instance, he says that the cav
alry pistol is too small in caliber; it has
no stopping power, though it carries
unnecessarily far. The general recom
mendation of the service is that the cali
ber be increased above 45. rather than de
creased, and that it be given a range of
75 or 100 yards for effective work. Except
for its shock action, the pistol is of little
service. The saber should be enameled
with bicycle enamel, as should all metal
parts of the equipment, to resist the rust,
which rapidly destroys steel and iron in
Cuba. The cavalry boot is shunned by all
soldiers, and it is recommended that it
be abandoned. The khaki leggings are
unsatisfactory: they hunch at the ankle,
are not durable and must be laced too
tight. If a leg-ging is to be worn at all,
it should be an English leather legging.
The campaign hat has no proper place in
the army in tropical climates. At any
rate, it should be made of much better
material and lighter. Finally, Colonel
Burton recommends a complete revision
of the cavalry drill regulations, which are
severely criticized.
WASHINGTON. Oct. lO.-Tne War De

President Snow, during his life, was the
husband of nine wives and the father of
forty-three children. Three of his wives
are still living.
President Snow -will be known as the
business president of the Mormon church.
His first moves after his promotion to
the head of the church were all of a
financial nature. The church had been
b&dly crippled financially by the confis-
Lorenzo Snow was born in Mantua,
Portage County, Ohio, April 3, 1814, receiv
ing a classical education at Oberlin Col
lege. He became a convert to Mormon
ism in 183a and immediately began prose
lyting. Since then he has been one of the
most active and prominent members of
the church organization. He has been on
numerous foreign missions, the most im
portant being that to Great Britain in
1840, where he became president of the
London conference.
In 1S4S, at the head of a train, of one
hundred wagons, he made the overland
trip from Illinois to the present site of
Salt Lake City, and in all the work of
founding and building up of this city he
has been a leader. For thirty years, com
mencing with 1S52, he was a member of
the Territorial Legislature, chiefly as pre
siding officer of the upper house. In 1855,
with fifty famines, he founded and named
Brigham City, in Northern Utah, which
was his home for many years. In 1886,
during the agitation against the practice
of polygamy, he was convicted of unlaw
ful cohabitation and sentenced to three
terms of six months each, but later was
released on a writ of habeas corpus. On
September 13. 1S98, he was chosen presi
dent of the church in succession to Wil
ford "Woodruff.
President Snow leaves a large family,
the members being scattered throughout
the world. AH have been notified of his
demise. /
The church authorities became alarmed
at his condition early yesterday and most
of the leaders, together with such mem
bers of h}s family as could be summoned
by telegraph and otherwise, remained In
the sick chamber until the end.
The news of President Snow's death
caused a great shock to the entire com
munity and is deeply deplored by all
classes, for he was regarded as a broad
minded, generous-hearted Christian, who
desired the upbuilding of Utah as well
as the progress of the Mormon church.
President Snow's death dissolves the
first presidency, of which he was the
head, his two councilors being Joseph F.
Smith and Rudger Clawson. Until his
successor is chosen, which may not be
until the annual conference next April,
the leadership of the church will devolve
upon the council of twelve apostles, of
which body Mr. Smith is. the" recognized
head. Unless death should come to him
in the meantime Mr. Smith will be the
next president of the church.
The church leaders will probably meet
to-morrow and make arrangements for
the funeral.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Oct. 10.âLoren
zo Snow, fifth president of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints, better known as the
Mormon church, died rather un
expectedly at his private residence, the
historic Bee-Hive House, at 3:35 o'clock
this afternoon, after an illness that had
been alarmingly serious only since yes
terday. The immediate cause of his death
was. hypostatic congestion, superinduced
by aggravated bronchitis. Several weeks
ago President Snow contracted a cold. He
was at his desk, however, attending to
business' as late as Tuesday. Yesterday
morning he was suddenly seized with a fit
of vomiting, which continued at intervals
throughout the day. Last night his phy
sicians were called and remained in con^
stant attendance until death came.

Baptists End Their Session.
It may not be announced that all Interests
absolutely agree that the new corporation
either has been organized or is" to be immedi
ately organized. The situation in this respect,
in fact, may be condensed as follows:
Firstâ Hill interests state positively that the
company has not only been organized, but
deposits of Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific stock have been freely made.
Secondâ Harriman Interests assert that the
company has been formed to take over the
control of Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific stock, but the present intention Is to
confine the operations to controlling the Great
Northern only; and that the Northern Pacific
matter will be taken up later.
Thirdâ Morgan interests claim that there
Is nothing- definite in the entire report, and
that nothing actually has been accomplished.
Fourthâ Rockefeller interests say the plan
thus far is one drawn entirely by J. J. Hill
and :that it has not yet received Morgan's
approval.
NEW YORK, Oct. lO.-The Journal of

The first definite Information of the long

(Thursday) in the announcement that a large
corporation has been or Is soon to be organ
ized for the sole purpose of owning a
in the two companies first named. . As tho
companies own the Burlington the transaction
means the control by the new corporation of

REDDI1CO, Oct. 10.â A railway collision
occurred at Hooker Station, ten miles
above Red Bluff, this mornine, in which
cars were demolished and the trainmen
and a section crew escaped serious in-
Jury by the sheerest luck.
A double-header work train, unable to
check itself, pitched into seven freight
cars and destroyed them. The heavy work
train which moves the large crew of men
employed on. the Red Bluff division, was
running up from the gravel beds to make
the siding: at Hooker to allow a south
bound train to pass- The work train was
behind time and two locomotives -were
puHlng- It along at unusual speed. There
is a down grade into H&oker and the work
train ran on . this in fast time and
straight on the sldine.
Away down the side track stood seven
box and flat cars with various cargoes.
John Armstrong, in charge of the first
engine, pulled at the air brake, but It
failed to respond.. The men in the en
gine saw the impending danger, but dared
not leap. The work train struck the cars
with a terrific concussion that tore every
one of them to pieces and scattered the
wood and steel and contents in every
direction. Both engines were. lifted off the
rails. The boiler of one blew out, but
the men in the cab sprang as the shock
came and escaped with a few cuts.

Marcus made the attempt on his life the
day before yesterday, and since then
those most directly concerned have en
deavored to keep the matter a secret.
Mrs. Bly is a rather pretty blonde, about
25 years of age. Marcus \u25a0 is well known,
about town as an oil speculator and man
of affairs.

taking a dose of laudanum. He now lies
seriously ill at the Waldeck Sanatorium,
while Mrs. Vera Bly, the tender object of
his unrequited affections, keeps strictly to
her apartments In the Sutherland Hotel,
fearful lest the rest "of "the boarders at the
Gutter-street hostelry should ply her with
Questions about the affair, which has al
ready .set the neighbors gossiping.
TIRED and weary of a long siege
in an attempt to gain the affec
tions of a pretty grass widow,
Harry Carroll Marcus attempted
the theater and other places of amuse
ment several times, but I really never
suspected until of late that he enter
tained any serious Intentions toward me.
When he first told me that he loved me
I counseled him to take his affections
'away back,' but he persisted, and now
you see the result. I do not want to be
deemed cruel or heartless, but his atten
tions really annoyed me so much that I
had to take a firm stand. and tell him
that there was no hope.
"I am very sorry that this affair has
leaked out. It puts me in a rather em
barrassing- position, especially when I am
entirely Innocent or having given him the
merest suspicion of encouragement. Mr.
Marcus is a very fine gentleman, and all
that, but I must characterize his act as
being extremely silly."
Marcus Is said to have made a former
attempt at suicide. It is alleged that he
was picked up one night recently in
Union square by several friends and taken
home,- where it was found necessary to
call In a physician.
The effects of the poison have almost
disappeared, but the attending physicians
say that Marcus is now suffering a severe
attack of peritonitis as a result of. his
act. It may be some weeks before he will
recover.
so foolish, and denied having offered him
the slightest encouragement.
"I have known Mr. Marcus for some
time," she said. "We have been out to
Cashier W.- K. Cole also denied that
Dimmick had told him that he needed the
money to straighten his account for the
bluestone Item. On the contrary, Dim
mick said that he wanted the money for
the purpose of paying the Selby people.
Ben W. Day, chief clerk of the Mint,
testified that Dimmick was absent from
the Mint from April 21 until May 21: '\u25a0\u25a0:
E. R. Synd, office clerk, testified that
he saw Dimmick enter the office on April
30 and put some coin into the drawer of
the safe. The witness knew that it was
coin because he heard the money Jingle.
United States Naval Officer John P.
Irish and Leon Blum testified that they
had known Dimmick for many years and
that his reputation for truth; honesty and
integrity was good.
Superintendent Leach was recalled and
testified in contradiction of Dimmick that
bluestone and other by-products of the
Mint, when sold, were never delivered un
til after they had been paid for, and that
he had not instructed Dimmick to carry
the bluestone it,em into the succeeding
quarter. He denied also that Dimmick
on March 31, or at any other time, had
made any explanation to him about that
transaction.
Leach Contradicts Dimmick.
Then the witness told how he had been
laid on his back with rheumatism, and
that on April 30, 1900, he had come to this
city in a carriage, drawn $400 from Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s bank,, gone to the Mint,
taken the $498 37 out of the office safe and
paid It to Cashier Cole. The witness
swore further that he had had a quarrel
with Leach and Cole and that they were
therefore preju Heed against him.
Dimmick testified that, he took the
voucher for $498 37- -.- to Cashier Cole
and drew the money,- explaining at
the ' same time what he wanted
it for. He placed the money In the
safe in his office and told Superintendent
.Leach "about the $405 discrepancy in the
statement and what he had done to rec
tify it. Leach instructed him to take out
the bluestone item and hold it over until
the next quarter. This Dimmick ilid, the
$498 37 remaining in his safe. A few days
later, when the Selby Company paid the
$405 for the Milestone, that money was
also put into the safe by, Dimmick. The
witness swore further, that Cashier Cole
was mistaken as to the date of the draw
ing of the $43S 37. It was not April I, but
March 31. '
The witness denied' also that he had
drawn the amounts of two other vouch
ers from Cole, and insisted that all he had
received was $<i:>8 37.
The DImmick case was closed in the
United States District Court yesterday
nfte.n-jon.so far as the evidence. was con
cerned,, and Bert Schleslnger of special
counsel for the Government concluded the
opening argument to the jury. Mr. Col
lins will begin his argument for the de
fense at .11 o'clock this morning.' Â»â¢
Walter N. DImmick, the defendant, was
placed on the 6tand the first thing In the
morning. He gave ' his testimony glibly
and with an apparent air of frankness,
but left the witness stand several times
for the purpose of holding a whispered
consultation with Mr. Collins. He denied
that he received the $498 37 from Cashier
Cole on April 7, 1900, but admitted that he
drew the money on March 31 of the same
year. He explained that he had on that
day Bold twenty barrels of bluestone to
the Selby Smelting ami Lead Company
for $405. The Milestone, however, had not
been delivered and the Selby Company
had not yald for It."' In making up his
statement for the quarter ended March
31, 1900,.. he had inserter! this Item. This
would leave an -apparent shortage of $405,

slight illness, Mrs. Bly visited him. When
she entered the room the would-be sui
cide, according to her story, renewed his
attentions and asked if he could only

What Shall
We Eat
To Keep Healthy and Strong-?
A healthy -appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats is undoubtedly the best, in
epite of the claims made by vegetarians
and food cranks generally.
As compared with grains and vegeta-
bles, meat furnishes the most nutriment
in a highly concentrated form and is di-
gested and assimilated more quickly than
vegetables or grains.
L>r. Julius hemusson on this subject
says: N'ervous persons, people run down
in health and of low vitality, should eat
plenty of meat. If the digestion is too
feeble at first it may be easily strength-
ened by the regular use cf Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meaL Two of*
these excellent tablets taien after dinner
will digest several thousand grains of
meat, eggs or other animal food in three
or four hours, while the malt diastase also
contained in Stuart's Tablets cause the
perfect digestion of starchy foods, like
potatoes, bread, etc., and no matter how
weak the stomach may be. no trouble will
be experienced if a regular practice is
made of using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
because they supply the peps-ln and
diastase so necessary to perfect digestion.
end ar.y form of indigestion and stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach will
be overcome by their dally use.
That large class of people who come un-
der the head of nervous dyspeptics should
eat plenty of meat and insure its com-
plete digestion by the systematic use of a
safe, harmless digestive medicine like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, composed of
the natural digestive principles, peptones
and diastase, which actually perform the
work of digestion and give the abused
etomach a chance to rest and to furnish
the bedy and brain with the necessary-
nutriment. Cheap cathartic medicines
masquerading under the name of dyspep-
sia cures are useless for relief or cure of
indigestion, because they have absolutely
no effect upon the actual digestion of
food.
Dyspepsia in all its forms is simply a
failure of the stomach to digest food and
the sensible way to solve the riddle and
cure the indigestion is to make daily use
et meal time of a safe preparation which
is'lndorsed by tho medical profession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples, and all this can truly be said of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

States. Canada and Great Britain sell
them at the uniform price of fifty cents
for full treatment.

improvement at ,the opening in response to the

pending the Government report, there were only
narrow fluctuations, save a slight reaction In
sympathy with a flurry in corn and December
closed steady, a shade lower at 69%c.
Apprehension of an Increase in the Govern
ment crop report, together with lower cables
and liberal receipts, had a depressing" influence
on corn early, but it steadied | on uneasiness

The pressure baa risen slowly over the
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The market is almost devoid of feature at
the moment. Peaches are higher, as stocks are
steadily decreasing. Plums and Prunes are
firm and in light supply. Some poor Figs and
Quinces are coming in. The same may be
said of Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons, some
of the arrivals being overripe. Choice Apples,
free from worms, continue firm. Table Grapes
are in fair supply and the warm weather has
stimulated their sale. * \u25a0

local dealers cautious. A dispatch from Chi
cago to Bolton, de Ruyter & Co. says that if
the advance in Hogs had stopped around 6c
there would have been a good steady distribu
tive trade, but they went up to $7 40, the high
est price for eight years, and checked the de
mand. Since then the market has been on the
down grade. One Chicago packer says that he
has not killed a hog for a month and still has
plenty of product -to sell. The .product has
Wheat and- Other Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign markets continue weak,
with still lower futures at Paris 4 and \ Liver
pool.
Chicago was steady and dull. Minneapolis
stocks have increased 300,000 bushels thus far
this week. The Northwestern movement is
likely to be interrupted by wet weather.
Futures were weaker again yesterday, but
shipping grades were not disturbed.

Dealers are selling both Butter and Eggs,
even at concessions. In fact, as far as ap
pears, there are more goods selling below the
quotations than at them. Meanwhile prices go
up every day or so. In this respect the situ
ation has been unique for some days. The ma
jority of dealers consider the advance in both
Butter and Eggs too sharp, and say they have
plenty of stock. Butter is relatively firmer
than Eggs. There is no change in Cheese.
Receipts were 17.600 pounds of Butter,

LONDON, Oct. 10.â The fifth series of the
wool auction sales closed to-day with a good
attendance of buyers. The selection was good
and the various grades offered met with active
competition. Since the close of the July series
there was some improvement in the demand
for finer growths experienced in the manufac
turing districts. The movement was largely
due to the necessities of the German and
French manufacturers and spinners, who failed
to replenish their stocks, allowing them to run
abnormally low during the financial troubles
of 1900. Merinos were In "strong demand and
advanced Vh. per cent. All scoureds showed fur
ther hardening as the sales progressed. The
finer scoureds sold fully 10 per cent and super
grades 5 to 7%. per cent above the July aver
age. Fine crossbreds advanced 5 to 10 per cent
to the higher points of the series. Superiors
held the advance until the close, but medium
and Inferior merlnoes weakened somewhat. The
closing tone, however," was firm. Coarse cross
breds declined until prices reached 5 per cent
below the July 6eries. The general demand
during the entire series was strong and ani
mated. During the series 305,000 bales were
available, and of this number 2S3.196 were cata
logued. The total sales numbered 141,600 balfes
to the home trade, 127,000 to the' Continent, 3000
to America and 34,000 held over. \

NEW YORK. Oct. 10.â There was a notable
revival of speculation in the stock market to
day, following the wavering and hesitating
movement of the last day or two. Pretty
much every department of the market became
affected in an increasing degree and in the
late dealings the market bec&me fairly buoy
ant and closed active and strong" at about the
top leveL This sudden outburst of speculation
at a reversal of the recently ourrent sentiment
caused a circulation of many rumors and gave
rise to a supposition of some important de
velopment in the financial world not yet dis
closed to the public The rumors centered
about supposed further developments in the
Northwestern railroad world and early took the
form of a plan tor adjustment with the Can
adian Pacitic. which might eliminate compe
tition. Another report specifically formulated
was that a corporation was to be formed to
consolidate thÂ«,ownership of the Great No'rth
ern and Northern Pacific on the basis of 2J0
shares for Great Northern preferred and 125
for Northern Pacific common, Northern Paciflo
preferred to be retired at par. The transcon
tinental stocks, which had been somewhat
neglected in the early strength, leaped into
activity and strength. Great Northern pre
ferred jumped 8 points to 136%; Northern Pa
cific preferred and Chicago and Northwestern 3,
St. Paul 2% and Union Pacific 2^4. There was
a renewed heavy demand for the Erie stocks
also, which lifted them l*i@4. This culmina
tion of the day's bullish tendency caused a rush
to cover by the bears. The demand from this
source showed a state bordering on demoraliza
tion on the part of the large short interest in
the market. The majority of active stocks are
a point or more higher. The coalers showed
the first marked evidence of. strength. New
Jersey Central jumping 7 points and others of
the group .1 to 4. Amalgamated Copper and
Sugar were very active and strong: at an ad
vance of about 3 points each, the short in
terest playing an important part in their move
ment. The opening of the market gave no pre
monition of the day's movement, many im
portant Etocks opening unchanged. Very large
speculative interests obviously had the market
in hand. They seemed to be actuated by a
belief that the resources of the banks were
now sufficient to provide for the season's de
mand from the interior for money. Taking
the ground that the fall demand for money
has been the only repressive Influence on the
market these interests inaugurated an active
buying movement for a recovery in the mar
ket. Several unfavorable factors were com
pletely ignored. Some of these were the notable
strength of sterling exchange, which was em
phasized to-day, .renewed softness in the Lon
don market for .raw copper, the threatened ex
tension of the trade war between the American
Sugar RefiDing Company and the beet sugar
interests, decidedly less sanguine views of the
year's outlook tor the iron industry, a declining
ratio of increas* of railroad earnings and vari
ous minor factors which have been influential
of late.
There was a decided increase of activity in
the railroad bond market and prices generally
advanced. Total sales, par value, $4,784,00<>.
United States new 4s advanced V4 per cent
on the last call.

- As will be seen under the head of Provisions,
the Hog market Is declining throughout the
West. A dispatch from Chicago to this city
says that Henry Zeiss, a Chicago packer, says:
"Last month the best Hogs sold at $7 40. Now
they are down to $6 60 and before long they
will be $5 50. This has been a year of extremes.
They rose higher than was warranted and are
now apt to go lower than warranted."
There Is no change in this market. The
packers continue in the market for Hogs, while
supplies of Beef, Mutton and Veal are sufficient
for all requirements.

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:'
The better feeling in the stock market con- |
tlnues, although trading Is quiet. The Ameri

day, dealings In that group steadily increasing
in volume, developing into a burst of activity
on the street after the close of business. In
the upward movement the coal stocks, particu

CHICAGO, Oct. 10.â Stricken by recur
rent affection of the heart, a malady to
which he has long been subjected, Mar
quis Ito, the former Premier of Japan, is
confined to his room at the Auditorium
Annex and may be forced to abandon his
prospective tour of the United States. His
condition is such that his attendants are
much distressed concerning him. All plans
for the visit In Chicago were laid aside
and no arrangements were made for the
continuance of the journey. F. Koyama,
the Marquis' physician, said to-night that
his condition was less hopeful than in the
early part of the journey.
"We may be forced to return to Japan
at any time because of his Excellency's
health, and for that reason we have made
our plans from day to day," he said. "It
was our hope that travel in this country
and in Europe would be of much benefit to
him and that rest from cares of state
would give him the needed strength."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â It Is the in

one of its vessels down to Panama In the
near future to relieve the battleship Iowa,
which has been watching over American
interests there during the unsettled con
dition of affairs on the isthmus and which
ie in need of docking and overhauling.
When this Is done the Iowa will proceed
down to Talcahuano, Chile, to dock, and
will be the first big American ship to go
into dock outside the United States. It
has not been decided what vessel will .re
lieve the Iowa, but it will probably be the
protected cruiser Philadelphia, which is
now cruising along the coast of Califor

BERKELEY, Oct. 10.â P. W. Owen,
a senior in the College of Social
Sciences, has written this year's
prize football song for the Uni
versity of California. It is en
titled "Foot-Ball-Ball-Ball" and won the
prize offered by the student executive
committee. There were one hundred com
petitors for the prize. i
Each year new songs and yells are
wanted for noise-making at the intercol
legiate game and each year dozens of stu
dents puzzle their brains for something
new and. novel. Good yells are particular
ly hard to secure and although many were
submitted this term none were considered
worthy of prizes.
Owen's song is written to the tune of
"Copn-Coon-Coon" and is as follows:
Blue; blue, blue, wo sing for California, \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
Gold, gold, gold, we all shout rah! rah! rah!
Red, red, " red, that color we hate to see.
We'll swallow them up like Pharaoh In
' Bed, Red Sea.
Howl, howl, howl, then shout our oskl wow,
AH play ball and teach the lobsters how.
Tell, cry, bawl, just mash them to the wall,
We'll break their backs, disgrace them, in
foot-ball-ball-ball.

And your captain so conceited.
That you wish he wag "back-seated,"
And your rooters cursing Fate, Stanford, dear!
We are bound to win the game, Stanford dear!

And when it s all been done, Stanford, dear!

We won't uree you any more,
But we'll sing as you depart, Stanford, dear!

The heroine of this unusual elopement
is credited with much firmness of charac
ter, which does not brook what she con
siders unwarranted small talk on the part
of her -wide circle of acquaintances. Her
daughters, one of whom is Mrs. R. Reid,
wife of a Haywards druggist, do not at
tempt to openly comment upon their
mother's runaway match. Mrs. Williams
id content to say that she was in love with
her bucolic swain and that declaration
suffices to explain her action.
The youthful bridegroom, has been
known to his present wife for many
years, even \u25a0when he was a barefoot boy
on the farm. When he was perched upon
a load of hay hauled to the Hamilton
home the lad had the eye of his employer,
little dreaming perhaps that he should vo
socn become her life partner.
Mrs. Hamilton-Williams insists that the.
marriage resulted from a proposal she re
ceived from her new husband some time
before the wedding at Stockton on IVIon-

friends by clandestinely wedding Robert

Prizes were awarded to-day in the compe
tition for yells and football songs, which
was instituted by the student body execu
tive committee. A large number of yells
and songs were submitted to the song
committee, composed of E. E. Gilman '01,
P. P. Parker '0a and A. S. Henley '04. It
awarded the prize for the best song to M.
A. Thomas Jr. '04. and for the yell to F.
B. Wagner '02. The song, "Just Because
They Hit That Line So Hard." is a catchy
hit on Professor Thomas Bacon's speech
to the University of California students,
in which he referred to Stanford football
players as fallen stars. The yell is com
posed of Spanish words and Is considered
one of the best that has ever been sub
mitted in a competition at Stanford.

Drs. Rowell and Hatch, who testified at
the trial that they thought Adams Insane,
and Dr. Lustig of San Francisco will of
fer expert testimony at the insanity trial.
The same \u25a0witnesses may be summoned
who testified at his trial and the District
Attorney must conduct the proceedings,
counsel being allowed tc appear for the
defense. The defendant may be detained
until the jury determines the question of
his continuing insanity and if he is de
clared insane he may be committed to an
asylum.
It is understood that no contest will be
made by the defense to prevent Adams
being sent to an asylum and it is prob
able that the prosecution will be assisted
by the defense. Miss Adams is said to be
desirous of having her father detained in
some asylum until he recovers from his
insane tendencies and Adams himself has
said that he does not care much what 13
done with him.
Adams took an interest in all that went
on about him and seemed to have re
covered from his dejection.
The proceedings before Judge Meivin
were short and formal. After the session
began the court called up the matter and
at the end of a short discussion amons
the attorneys it was decided to fix the
trial for October 17. Adams was then
taken back to the County Jail for safe
keeping.
The verdict rendered by the jury in the
Adams case is without precedent in the
State, so District Attorney Allen says.
All verdicts in former murder cases have
pronounced upon the guilt or innocence of
the accused only, with perhaps a recom
mendation as to the severity of the pun
ishment, but in this case the jury decided
that the accused was "not guilty by rea
son of insanity." Provision is made in
the Penal Code for just such cases as this,
the declaration being made in section 116T
that where the jury renders a verdict of
acquittal on the ground of Insanity the
court may order a jury impaneled to In
quire whether the defendant is still in
sane.
Daughter Want3 Him Confined.
Recovers From His Dejection.
When the verdict was announced yes
terday afternoon Judge Melvin directed
the /Sheriff to restrain, the man who had
just been acquitted of murder until after
his trial for insanity and ordered him
brought into his presence this morning
for the purpose of fixing the time for
holding the proceeding.
Adams came into the courtroom this
morning accompanied by his daughter.
Miss Agnes S. Adams, and a deputy
sheriff. He limped slightly from the par
tial paralysis that affects his right side,
but otherwise his general appearance was
very much improved. He assumed a mora
erect attitude in his chair than he has
her?tofore and he was altogether neglect
ful of the watch he habitually handled
and the scant hair he stroked during the
progress of the trial.
Charles G.. Adams, the slayer of Dr.
John G. Jessup, who was acquitted yes
terday by a jury in Judge Melvin's court
by reason of his insanity, is destined to
face another jury before he is finally lost
to the public eye. Judge Melvin to-day
set Thursday, October 17, as the time for
the trial of the unfrocked clergyman be
fore a jury on an information of insanity.
On the result of that trial and the Ae
liberations of the jury depend whether he
remains in confinement or is given his
freedom.

The promised investigation into the acts
of Attorney E. Myron Wolf, trustee of
the estate of Mrs. Mary Brunnings, who
was declared Insane and recently restored
to capacity, came to an abrupt close In
Judge Cook's court. yesterday. In a peti
tion for a change of venue Attorney Fran-
J. H. Tibbitts, who has been examining
Into the copper deposits of. Shasta County
for tho State Mining Bureau, predicts that
in a few years Shasta will be mentioned
in the list with Butte, Mont., arid Cripple
Creek, Colo. He estimates that by 1903
the annual mineral output of the county
will amount to $12,000,000. The figures
show an increase from $623,443 . in 1896 to
$5,574,020 in 1900, and the present rate of
production Mr. Tibbitts finds to be $3,139,
026 per finnum. The Mountain Copper
Company's output for 1900 is estimated at
$4,149,872 in copper, and the gold and silver
bring up the total to $4,772,&85. This year
the JDe la Mar smelters at De la Mar
treating the ores from the Bully Hill
mine, are adding $250,000 per month to the
output, and this will be increased to $450 -
000 per month when- the addition now
making to the present plant is completed.
Mr. Tibbitts says that the Bully Hill mine
will eventually add $5,000,000 per annum
to the output of Shasta County.
When tho smelter- of the Trinity Copper
Company is operating, Mr. Tibbitts says
the Trinity property may be counted on
to rival the other copper mines, and from
that time the mineral production of
bhasta will be In excess of $1,000,000 per
month. In five years Shasta County will
employ 5000 to 6000 miners and produce
from $20,000,000 to $25,000,000 worth of cop
per, gold and silver. There are great
expectations entertained concerning the
Balakala mine, the Backbone and After
thought districts and the region between
Balakala and Iron Mountain.
Redding is rapidly growing. Mr. Tib
bitts says that it will have a population
of 20,000 before the end of the first decade
of this century. There are â¢ two great
power -plants under way in the county
one of which, that of the Keswick Light
and Power Company, will be ready to de
liver light and power this year. Redding
which is expending $250,000 on buildings
and is proposing an electric road to Kes
wick, may also have the advantage of a
copper belt railway. . â¢
Shasta County will send down a large
delegation to the California Miners' Con
vention. -L
\u25a0"While the Code of Civil Procedure is the
only code directly involved In tne decision of
the court the Penal Code, the Civil Code and
the county governments act would all seem
affected by the same line of argument, as all
were enacted. in the same manner. The. other
cases have not as yet come before the court
and there may be a difference in them which
will affect the decision of the court.
The question as to the validity of the
codes was brought up in the Supreme Court
on August 5 In five different proceedings
in mandamus. The cases were instituted
to make certain Judges perform duties
from which they were freed under the
new codes. . Incidentally the Attorney
General brought up the question and the
lawyers in the succeeding cases advanced
the same arguments, so all were referred
to the court at the same time. Those yet
te be decided are Gillis vs. Judge Jones of
San Joaquin County, Leventon vs. Judge
Harrington of Modoc County, in connec
tion with the Lpokout lynchings, . and
Watt vs. Judge Cook of San Francisco.
In the years subsequent to the adoption
of the new constitution lt was discovered
that many laws should be revised or
amended. ! In 1895 Governor Budd appoint
ed a commission to do this work. Gov
ernor Gage made reappolntments and the
recommendations of the Commissioners
named by him were adopted at the recent
session of the Legislature with the pres
ent discouraging result.
Justices Henshaw, Van Dyke. Temple,
Harrison and Garoutte concur directly in
the opinion written by Justice McFarland.
Chief Justice Beatty concurs on the point
that the law is unconstitutional > from the
fact of its having been enacted in frag
mentary form, but dissents from the view
that the subject Is inadequate. He con
tends that the Code of Civil Procedure is
clearly denned. - â¢
In an interview the Chief Justice stated:
County Government Act Too.
the said act is unconstitutional and void for
all purposes and is inoperative to change or
in any way affect the law of the State as It
stood Immediately before the approval of. said
act. Â»:. â¢
TIBBITTS TALKS
ABOUT COPPER
Judge Cook remarked that In view of
what had transpired he had serious
doubts as to the wisdom of restoring Mrs.
Brunnings to capacity. It was hinted
thaf Attorneys Pierce and Wolf might in
stitute proceedings for the disbarment of
Pope and Archer.
cis Pope, for Mrs. Brunnlngs, made cer
tain allegations that particularly reflected
upon Attorney W. L. 'Pierce and the trus
tee, which were scathingly denounced in
court by Attorney Pierce Tuesday.
When the matter was called yesterday
for Investigation Attorney Pope said he
had been instructed by Attorney LÂ». B.
Archer of San Jose, senior counsel >for
Mrs. Brunnlngs, to make a motion for
the withdrawal of the petition. Ex-Judge
Slack opposed the motion, as he wanted a
thorough investigation to vindicate his
clients. Attorneys Pierce and Wolf; but
the Judge said there was no alternativeâ
the motion would prevail. He then asked
that the petition be stricken from the
record, but the Judge said he did not have
that power. All he could do was to state
on the record that the petition had been
withdrawn on motion of its author.
The matter of the annual report of the
trustee then came up for hearing. Pope
begged leave to \u25a0withdraw from the case.
He had asked for no fee and would make
no claim for compensation. Ex- Judge
Slack said he would also receive no fee
for his services. . The court appointed At
torney L>. deF. Barteltt to represent Mrs.
Brunnings, and Wolf testified as to the
accounts, showing that each had been
paid by order of court and duly certified.
Bartlett had no protest to make, but said
he might petition'for the appointment of
a new trustee. *

Companions Are Questioned.
FRANK RODRIGUEZ, 20 years of
age, was shot in the head in room
11 of the lodging-house at 803
Montgomery street yesterday aft
ernoon, and three other youths-
Clement Aragon, 16: Charles Aragon, 22,
and John Mendez, 20 â are being detained
in the City Prison pending the result of
the wound and an investigation by the
police.
The room in which the shooting took
place was occupied by Clement Aragon.
Rodnruez slept with him "Wednesday
night and about 1 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon Policemen Nelson and Maloney
were notified by the landlady of the house
that Rodriguez had been shot. "When
they entered the room they found Clem
ent Aragon supporting the unconscious
fcrm of Rodriguez, who had been shot In
the head. They summoned, the ambulance
and Rodriguez was sent to the Receiving
Hospital, where the opinion was expressed
that he would die. ' .
The officers noticed that a pane of glass
in the window of the room was broken
and Arazon said he had thrown the re
volver, in his excitement, through the
window to the roof of the - adjoining
building, where Policeman Nelson found
it. There were loaded cartridges' in it
and two empty ones. The officers also
noticed a hole in the ceiling, evidently
made fay a bullet, and .part of the plaster
was scattered on the floor, showing that
the shot had been recently fired.
Many arguments are advanced by the
respondents and one after the other they
are summarily dismissed by the court.
In fact the able legal lights who try to
uphold the codes find apparently little
ground on which a stand may be taken.
The wording of the constitution is such
that there can be little discussion as to
its meaning, on the point in question at
least. The law was clearly violated, so
the decision says, and the labors of the
Code Commission and the Legislature, so
far as they are mutually concerned, is un
done. The court admits that the intent
of the commission was praiseworthy, but
apparently not. productive of desired re
sults. It .is, said by the Justices that the
decision is to be deplored, but Justice Mc-
Farland and his associates are, of course,
firm in the opinion that: the law must be
followed, even though the results seem to
be disastrous.
On this point, the court says in clos
ing: , V
Complaint Is ; made that the rule aa" above
stated would put .the Legislature to .great in-'

That consideration could not, under any cir
cumstances, destroy a- constitutional provision
Butâ without impugning the wisdom of any
provision of the 'act before usâ lt Is quite ap
parent that the very purpose of the constitu
tional provision In question is to prevent the
evils which might come from hasty, inconsid
erate or wholesale legislation. The statutes
which cannot be enacted in the manner pre
scribed by the constitution should not be at
tempted. The scarcity of statutory laws and
want of facility for passing them are not
among the evils of the times.
â¢ Our conclusion is that, for the reasons stated.
Labors of Commission Undone.
How then can lt be rightly said that a mere
reference to the title . of an act expresses any
subject? If so, what subject? It does not
even refer to a single section which Is to be
amended or repealed, and as to the "new"
sections it does not give the slightest intima
tion as to what they, are to contain.
, The various respondents maintain that
the title in question is a device for insert
ing a subject '"broad" enough to cover
everything. Considering the matter in
this light Justice McFarland says:
Under that view the people who framed and
adopted the constitution would be convicted of
folly in elaborately construing- a -grave con
stitutional limitation of legislative power upon
a most important subject when the Legislature
could at once circumvent it by a mere verbal
trick. \
It Is contended on the part of the re
spondents that although the title does
not, as an independent instrument, ex
press any subject, yet it does so by "ref
erence." The court concedes that where
the title still expresses a definite subject
then the title of an amendatory act may
be helped by reference lo the title of the
original act, which does express a subject,
being incorporated into the title of the
amendatory act.
The case at bar, however, refers merely
to the Code of Civil Procedure. The court
holds that the name Civil Procedure cov
ers the great body of the State's laws and
is not confined to any particular line of
subjects, but includes substantive law,
criminal law and "legislation that might
be classed under any category whatever."
The law recognizes four codesâ the Civil
Code, the Political Code, the Penal Code
and the Code of Vivil Procedure.
Justice McFarland in his decision states
that legislation under any code is insep
arably interwoven with legislation under
the others. He says further:
The form in which revisions and amend
ments were presented to the Legislature
was a connotation of the numeral by
which the statute is designated, followed
by the text of whatever it was desired to
be enacted, to repeal, add or correct in
the original lav/. The court says:
Tho Bald Code of Civil Procedure was not
"re-enacted and published at length as revised."
It seems as though the mind of either layman
or lawyer might accept with safety the con
struction which is so obvious.
' The first part of the constitutional law
was violated, and there was little or no
defense offered. The court does not even
pause to argue the matter.
In reference to the second question, that
"every act shall embrace but one sub
ject," the points made by the respondents
and the anxious amici curiae are deemed
worthy of an answer. The- title of the act
in question is "An act to revise the Code
of Civil Procedure by amending certain
sections, repealing others and 'adding cer
tain new sections."
The court on this point says:
It is apparent that the language of the title
of the act in question in and of itself ex
presses no subject whatever. No or." could
tell from the title alone what subject of legis
lation was dealt with in the body of the act;
such subject, as far as the title of. the act in
forms us. might have been entirely different
from, anything to be found in the act itself.
All the Codes Affected.
Construction Is Obvious.
The Supreme Court yesterday declared
unanimously that the Code of Civil Pro
cedure as revised and amended during the
last session of the Legislature is uncon
stitutional. Chief Justice Beatty says
that the fate of the Penal Code, the Civil
Code and the county government act will
probably be the same. The work of the
Code Commission, covering a period of
seven years and costing directly about
$100,000, is rendered valueless. The fault
seems, by the decision of the Supreme
Court, to rest entirely on the carelessness
of Governor Gage's appointees In present
ing the revisions and amendments for en
actment in an unconstitutional form.' .
The statutes will remain as they were
before the new codes- were adopted. The
outlook is not pleasant, for courts all
over the State will now be beset with
difficulties. Scores of cases will have to
be tried all over again. Appeals and peti
tions for new trials will be 'presented in
dismaying numbers. The Code of Civil
Procedure is the only one directly in
volved In the decision, but a half-dozen
cases In which the other codes mentioned
are concerned are before the , Supreme
Court and must apparently be annulled
for the same reasons.
Article IV of the State constitution, re
ferring to provisions and amendments,
says:
No law shall bÂ« revised or amended by ref
erence to its title; but In each case the act
revised or section amended shall be re-enacted
and published at length as revised or amended.
Every act shall embrace but one subject, which
shall be expressed In Its title.
