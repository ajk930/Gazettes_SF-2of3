of fusion of the Popuiist and Democratic

"The strength of the People's party
never did lie in its party organization. In
deed, one of its mfnor impulses was a
protest against tho dangers and the
tyranny of permanent party organization.
"What foolishness to let the fetich of

BUTTE, Mont., June 2.â The strange
sliding movement of the city of Butte,
â¢which has been noticeable at intervale for
several years, has again manifested itsei*
by five large cracks in the earth in dif

crevice occurred on West Galena street,
where a crack twelve inches wiJe and of
considerable length and deptn has ap
peared. Three of the- opening's occur on
the west side of the town and two t n the

(Seal) "HENRY T. GAGE. Governor.
"Attest: C. F. CURRY,
"Secretary of State."
Governor Gage has also offered a re
ward of $300 for the arrest and conviction
of E. A. Illinssworth. who killled Con
stable II. S. Walker of Modoc County. II
lingsworth, who had escaped from the
County Jail, killed the Constable whfie
resisting arrest. , â¢
Size of Reward Unprecedented.
The action of the Governor is regarded
as extraordinary in view of the fact that
the usual amount of the reward in cases
of murder is but $300. In fact, the pres
ent offer is declared to be without piece
dent and testifies to the abhorrence with
which the crime is viewed.
It Is rot. probable that the State will
take other action than the present/ at
least not until it is shown that the county
officials of. Modoc are unwilling or power
less to administer justice. In that event
the Attorney General would probably be
called upon to act, and^the secrat service
fund at the disposal of the Governor
could be utilized to fasten the responsibil
ity far the lynching upon -the shoulder's cf
the guilty^ Governor Gage has'bjen re
. markably chary in the matter of Issuing
offers of reward for the apprehension of
murderers, and his present action is 8n
Indication of the strong sentiment of con
demnation of the acts of the Modoc
lynchers-which pervades official circles.
Governor Gage left last evening on the
Owl train for Ja>s Angeles, where he will
probably remain for ten days or two
weeks. He will not cease, however, to
urge upon the officials of Modoc County
the necessity of vigorous action to appre
hend the guilty leaders of the rnob.
"Now, therefore. I. Henry T. Gage, Gov
ernor of the State of California, by virtue
cf the authority in me vested by the con
stitution and laws of said State, do here
by offer a. reward of five thousand dollars.
Disgrace Upon the People.
"Whereas, The notoriety and audacity
of the crimes if tolerated will likely lead
to a repetition of similar crimes in other
localities In this State, will brine disgrace
upon our law-abiding people, obstruct the
orderly conduct of courts of justice and
will tend to render life and property in
secure from the willful and wanton acts
of lawless mobs.
"Whereas. The said crimes w'ere com
mit by the said unknown perpetrators in
open defiance of the laws of the State of
California, by hanc'ug the said victims
until they were dead, under an unlawful
and audacious claim of a right to wreak
their personal vengeance upon the said
victims, on account of the alleged com
mission of petty crimes, for the punish

quately provide; and
"Whereas, On May 31. 1301, Jive men. to

Martin Hall and Daniel Yantis. were mur
dered at Lookout, ntar Alturas. in the

forcibly taken by the murderers from the
custody of the law; and
QOVERXOR GAGE, after spend

without parallel in the historv of ihe
State. By proclamation issued yesterday

Governor Gage was in San Francisco
Saturday and yesterday and was ?n tele
graphic and telephonic communication
T.1tb the Sheriff and District Attornev,of
Modoc County. Being convinced that
nothing in the evidence against the five
victims warranted In the least the out
rage upon law and order and justice per
petrated in their lynching, he drafted the
following proclamation, which was issued
from. Sacramento:
NEAL UNDER
ARREST FOR
FORGERY
legation that Neall had something "to 'do
with' the issuance of duplicate '..vouchers
while stationed at the Presidio. Neall de
nies having committed any forgeries and
claims he will be able to prove his inno
cence. -
The case of Captain '"Jack" Neall at
tracted a great deal of attention in this
city three years ago. He Â¦was one of the
most efficient and 'popular, officers in the
army and the news of his downfall cre
ated a. furor in army circles and in. the
upper crust of San Francisco society. :
â¢ At the outbreak of the Spanish war
Neall was located at the Presidio. Many
of his fellow-officers were ordered to the
front, which resulted in the placing of
added responsibilities upon the shoulders
of Neall. In addition to the 4 duties con
nected with his troop command he was
made exchange officer and also sprved as
officer in charge of the Presidio Club.
These duties wore onerous and brought
with thorn the handling of considerable I
cash. Under the strain of his multitud- |
inous duties Neall commenced to break
down and finally he resorted' to the U3c
of stimulants to enable him to continue at
his- post. Neall haul, a passion for cards
and when in liquor would play for high
stakes. He lost steadily, but played on,
hoping to recoup and restore the army
funds which his losing game had induced
him to use. -'>->' .'-,* '-""'>'*Â¦;
Â¦*-' - *l>ared Not- Face "Disgrace." '~ \
Early in February. 1899. Captain Neall
was notified that the quarterly inspection
of his books would be made in a few
days. At this time he was short $4300.
"With disgrace staring him In the face, he
knew not which way to turn. He deter
mined.to run away and when the next
morning an orderly went to' his quarters
to deliver him an order assigning him to
duty as officer of the day he was not to
be found.
His failure to appear caused a suspicion
to arise that all was not as it'should be,
and a hurried investigation revealed the
fact of the shortage. It was feared that
he, had committed suicide and for days
parties patroled the Presidio woods in
search of his body.
Neall had not taken his life, but had
gone to Old Mexico. His whereabouts
soon became known and Â¦ friends urged
him to return, informing him that his ac
counts would be made straight. He came
back and paid over to the military author
ities $4300, the amount of his shortage,
which was advanced by men of promi
nence who had faith in him. Ho reported
at the Presidio, however, too late to pre
vent 'a chafte of desertion being placed
against his name. He was court-mar
tialed and the findings of the court were
that he be dismissed from the : service.
Every effort was made by the California
delegation in Congress to save his com
mission. John \V. Mackay and Senator
Jones of Nevada made personal appeals
to the President, but at the time of the
trial army scandals were plentiful and
the President refused to disapprove the
verdict. Â¦ After losing his commission
NÂ«all went to Mexico and sought employ
ment as an engineer. He was unsuccess
ful and returned to this city after an ab
sence of little more than a year.
Neall is a brilliant Spanish and French
scholar, and while at West Point 'enjoyed
the, reputation of being a master of math
ematics.
About a year ago he accepted a posi
tion as engineer at the Anaconda mines'
in Butte, and advices from' that city say
he has been leading an exemplary life
during his residence there. ,.
News of' Arrest a Surprise.
AH seemed well with the unfortunate
captain and the news of his arrest' is a
surprise.
At the time of his trial Captain JCeall
was in the possession of ample funds and
made good every known shortage. At no
time, during the proceedings was " there
any intimation of forgery and on no occa
sion was he accused of the misuse of Gov
ernment papers. - -
Captain Neall's wife and two children
reside in Berkeley. Mrs. Neall is the
daughter of the late General Hardie, who
was inspector general of the army under
Secretary Seward.
Captain John M. >7eall. who was tried
by court-martial at ihe Presidio in Feb
luary, 1S99. and dismissed from the army
for^ "absence without leave," was arrested
at Butte. Mont., by a - deputy ' United

charging him with forgery. ,11 e will be

ship of his wife. They were in their, mar
ried life singularly helpful and consonant,
Herne being an ardent advocate >of. the
emancipation of woman, giving her an
equality with man before the law and be- !
fore society, as a means for purifying !
politics and elevating mankind. - Throe
daughters were born to them, Julia
Chrystal and Dorothy. â¢-
Mr. Herne's marked uuccesses as P.n
actor were in character parts, ranging
from Bill Sykes . in "Oliver Twist" to
Nathaniel Berry in "Shore Acres." His
first plays, "Hearts~bf Oak" and "The
Lighthouse on the Cliff" were produced in
this city in 1878: his "Minute Man" -at
Philadelphia In 1S85 and "Drifting Apart"
at the People's Theater in New York
City. "Shore Acres," the next of hU
plays, was not produced until after "Mar
garet Fleming," which was written ex- |
pressly for his wife, as were also the
"Minute Men" and "Drifting Apart.".'
"Shore Acres" was produced in- Chicago '.
in 1892, two years after the successful ;
production of -^'Margaret Fleming" at
Lynn, Mass. â¢ . . . -
Mr. Herne toured the â¢ country with
"Shore Acres" for a few seasons and. then '
produced two plays which did not meet'
public favor, r He quickly withdrew, them'
â¢and wrote "Sag Harbor." and it achieved
as great a triumph as did "Shore Acres."
The play was recently seen at the Colum- j
bia Theater by a road company. . -. Â»
Mr. Herne was a realist, both on and oft I
the stage. As an actor, he iived rather
than acted his characters, and In writing
he made his characters picture life as he
viewed it. He was simple in his habits '
and domestic in his traits. In nolitics he '
was independent, and in religion an evo
lutionist. He was 1 a disciple of Henry
George in his land philosophy, and be
lieved that free land means absolute lib
erty, not of one sex or of one class, but
of the race.
In many of the large cities of the East
and middle West Mr. Herne was i.ot only
popular as an actor but also as a lecturer
Thousands have listened to his views on
the question of "single tax." and the an
nouncement that Mr. Herne would deliver
an address on the subject' was suttlclent
guarantee of a crowded house.
Mr. Herne was stricken with illness
some months ago and he was obl'.g-ed to
relinquish : his role in "Sag-. Harbor" to
an understudy. Recent ad vices from New
York stated that the author-actor was
improving and ' that his return to -the
stage could be looked for.. The news of
his death was heard with deep regret last
night In theatrical circles here.

Returning to this city Mr. Herne ac
cepted the management of the Baldwin

that he met and was married to Katlier

From Washington Mr. Herne went to
the Walnut-street Theater, Philadelphia,
and thence to the Theater Royal, .Mon
treal. In Canada he engaged as leading
support to Helen Western, and traveled
with her for two seasons, subsequently
marrying her. At the end of the engage
ment he came to California, and opened
>ns a star at Platt's'Hall and at Maguire's
Opera-house in this city in 1864. He next
joined Lucille Western, a sister of Helen
Western, and. starred jointly with her for
several rears..
Mr. Herne delivered the opening address
at the inaugural performance at Ford's
Theater, a playhouse afterward made his

James A. Herne, actor and playwright,
was born at West Troy, New York, 1'cb

public schools of Albany, New York. He
early displayed â¢ histrionic talent, and
when 20 years old made nis first pi of es
siOnal appearance at the Adelpht Theater
in Troy. This engagement was made at
a salary of $6 per week. He afterward
went to Baltimore, where he became the
leading man of. the Holliday-street Thea
ter, and then to Ford's Theater, Washing
ton, both at that time under the manage

Herne, the well known actor and

CHICAGO. June 2.â Prayer from the
Presbyterian Assembly and from preach
ers of every religious denomination was
requested for the success of the eight
hour workday by the Chicago Federation
of Labor at a meeting here to-day. The
federation formulated a telegram to the
eynod, now in session at JPittsburg, and
the Secretary was ordered to send the
message to-night ' -
In this dispatch the Â«ynod was re
minded that no scoring of labor unions
for meetings on Sundays would be neces
sary if the hours of labor were shortened
to the union standard of eight a day,
and that the Chicago labor assembly in
vited the synod and religious workers
throughout the countr y to inaugurate a
vigorous campaign of prayer for the suc
cess of the eight-hour movement.
From the declarations of President
Bowman and other speakers favoring the
sending of the message it was apparent
that it was intended as a bit of satire
amounting: to a rebuke to the synod for
the criticisms recently uttered against
union labor on v the floor of the religious
assembly.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET N. W..
WASHINGTON, June 2.â Officials of the
administration to-day . for the first tlnvs
since the announcement of the decisions
of\ the Supreme. Court in the insular cases
began to admit that there is a growing
possibility of an extra session of Congress
in July." - â¢ ' , . , . ,*>Â¦:! i
If Attorney General Knox, after" a care
ful review of the decisions, concludes that
the President will not have "power under
the Spooner amendement to the army ap
propriation bill to impose duties on goods
going into the Philippines from the UniteU
States or coming into the United States
from the Philippines, the President wtil
seriously consider the advisability of issu
ing an immedate call for an extra session
of Congress.
| This statement is made on the authority
of a member of the Cabinet who is devot
ing much time to a study of the situation
raised by the decisions. Attorney General
Kncx and Secretary of War Root spent
several hours to-day discussing the legal
points involved. Mr. Knox is
hard on his opinion in order to have it
ready for the Cabinet meeting on -Tues
day. This meeting is expected to be ' of
great importance. The question which
will then be presented, and the one which
the Attorney General is now considering,
is whether the President will have tha
power not only to- promulgate a tariff for
the Philippines, but" to direct that either
the Dingley rates or some other rates of
duty shall be collected on goods coming:
from the "Philippines into- the ' United
States. . The only authority Â¦which tho
President would have for such actinr*
would be. the Spooncr amendment to the
army appropriation bill.

CHICAGO. June 2.â At a meeting to-day
of- the Chicago Protective League, which
formerly was the Jewish Peddlers*
Â¦Union, an appeal for justice was made for
the entire Jewish race, both rich and poor.
It was pointed out by numerous speak
ers that, while the poor and ignorant were
assaulted on Chicago streets, the wealthy
and educated were reviled and insulted on
frequent occasions. It was declared that,
regardless of the persecutions of the Jews
in Russia, they waie safer from, assault
and insult in that country than they were
on the streets of Chicago, and the charge
was made that the laws of Russia were
better, enforced than were the laws of the
city of Chicago.
Severe criticism was directed toward
many individual members of the Chicago
police force for their failure to furnish
protection to the members of the associa
tion.

Michael Doran, who has slept for two
years, has been discnarged aft cured from
the BInghamton State Hospital. When
he was sent to that institution his case
puzzled the doctors. He had an uncon
trollable desire to sleep. and his naps be
came longer and longer. All efforts to
awaken him proved unavailing and finally
he went to sleep and remained in a som
nolent state for two years, his only mpve
ment being to turn from one side to the
other, as though restless.
It was found necessary to feed him.arti
ficially and he remained in this state until
four months ago, when the attendants
noticed an occasional flutter of the eye
lids. This lasted for several days and then
as a man carrying bread passed through
the ward he asked for "bread," the first
word spoken in two years. It was given
him and from that time he recovered rap
idly, until he was able to go out in the
sunshine. This quickly restored the use
of ihis limbs and now he has been dis
charged as perfectly cured of any desire
to take lengthy naps.

'roof for cover. They are at their place at
Burlingame. Any of. us could and would
have done as much at so little an outlay,
and with such glorious returns."
I tried to dr.iw a dear, sweet, generoua
and well-known society woman into the
discussion.
"I offered ray home to the President,"
she said, "and would have .considered it
an honor to have had him for my guest."
.That Is as far as she would commit
herself. However,. I could read between
the words that had the President accept
ed, the citizens would not have had the
privilege of ' paying the caterer.
All the fun, though, is not confined to
one camp. The Ohio Society got. its little
surprise. It oa'me in the shape of a
laundry bill for the washing of a military
guest's linen-. As the general is worth
only about five millions, the Ohioans
must be excused for the gasp they gave
when they got the laundryman's account.,

What a glorious place the Voorhleses
have. I never saw it show up so beauti
fully as on ' Saturday, the.. day that
made sweet Anna Voorhies and Tom
Bishop one. I do not believe that any
other house in this city can boast' of so
many pieces- of old mahogany as can be
found up at the Voor-hles place. There is
a wonderful table and sideboard in a din
ing hall quite worthy of them, and a ta
ble more wonderful still in the bright and
cosy library. The library table is the
one on which Fresident Madison signed
the treaty of Ghent and the Voorhieses
value it beyond everything. Some of
Anna's presents were quite In keeping
with the many valuable old pieces of fur
niture in her home. One of. the presents
was a set of twelve silver candlesticks,
low and broad, and altogether ancient as
to pattern and design. Two other darling
candlesticks found. among the splendid
gifts were tall and graceful and slender,
just such ones as all collectors pine to
possess.
I never saw a family so uniformly
handsome and all gowned so beautifully
as were the Voorhies ladies on Saturday.
Mrs. Voorhies looked magnificent in a
gray satin gowr. trimmed with some rare
old Duchesse lace. Miss Voorhies was a
stunning pictuie In fluffy white chiffon
and Mrs. Malcolm Henry, nee Voorhies,
was radiant in white crepe with a dash
of pink at the neck and waist. â¢

HUSBAND FACES
MURDER CHARGE
Kansas Suspect Claims
Eis Wife Committed
Suicide.
Says He Buried Her Secretly
in Order to Avoid
Disgrace.
Klensmire is a farmer. 48 years old, tall,
pp&re and uneducated. He talks with hes
itation and appears dull of mind. .The
possibility that he will be tried for mur
der seemed secondary to the disgrace that
would result from the publicitj' of the af
fair. Klensmire was born near Holton,
and has always lived in that vicinity. His
mother and two or three brothers and
sisters live there and are prosperous and
respected. â¢
All this was got from Klensmire In
short, hesitating sentences. Asked aboui
the condition of his wife's crushed head,
he said:
"Maybe the dirt falling on it mashed it
in. â¢ 1 would not strike her."
There was no more than two feet of dirt
over the body when it was found.
My wife and I disagreed frequently, but I
usually let her have her own way. Just before
her death she was very angry because I
Â¦wanted to sell some land to which she had
Klsned a deed. She said she would leave me.
But I did not want people to know she had
left me. and told her to say she was going
away en a visit. We had a few words on
Sunday (May 12) about it. She went away,
and later I found her -body hanging from a
rcpe in the barn. I took her down, but was
ai'raid of the disgrace and hid her body in the
ftraw. The next day I buried her. I told the
Â«Ii!ldren she had gone to Texas, and the tele-
Rrsm I had sent EKylng; that she was dead was
intended to keep them from knowing she had
k;i!ed herself.
â¢ When arrested to-day Klensmire was at
the depot waiting to take a train, as. he
said, for Hoi ton. Â¦When told that he was
wtmted on suspicion of having murdered
his wife he refused for a time* to talk.
Then he declared that his wife had com
muted suicide on .May 12. On the follow
ing morning, he said, .when he found the
poay hanging from the rafters in their
house, he took it to the trench and buried
it. Klensmire denied that he Had mur
dered his wife. He was traced to Kansas
City, Kans.. by a Tcpeka detective, and
said that he hud arrived here on May 30.
He was taken to Topeka to-night.
Avlensmire was supposed to have gone
to Texas, but it appears that detectives
who have been working on the case traced
him to Kansas City yesterday. On Friday
List the . Klensmire children, in Holton.
received a telegram from Texas and ap
parently frpm their father stating that
-ills. Klensmire had died there of yellow
fever. Following: the finding of the body,
the mysterious murder in 1S92 of Paul
Swetlick. Mrs. Klensmire's brother, who
tarried $66,000 life insurance In favor of
the Klensmlres, was brought forth as a
suspicious circumstance, and this led to
coupling - Klensmire's mvsterious disap
pearance with the murder of his wife:
J^naHr Klensmire was Induced to make
the following statement:
KANSAS CITT, Mo.. June 2.-W. H.
Klensmire, whose wife was yesterday
found murdered near their home at Hol
ton. Kaas., buried in a shallow trench,
was arrested In Kansas City, Kans., to
day. Marks on the body, which Is be
lieved to. have been burled since May 29,
Indicated that Mrs. Klensmire's skull had
been crushed with a <Slub and suspicion
was directed against the husband, who
disappeared on that date.

Such reports'gave justification for the belief that the
\ Boers were being worn down and that further opera
tions by them, on a large scale were not tobe expected.;.
I The movement. against Vladfontein has,' however.V re-*
vealed the fact that the Boer armies have not yet'been
; scattered, the rank arid file have not become clespon-
I dent and the generals are as, resourceful and as ener
i gc'tic as ever. In fact, it is now feared that the recent
I movements were intended to cover' an , advance into-
Cape Colony, and that the British armies, so Carefully
i stationed to harry every section of the Transvaal, may
\ have to hurry away to protect the Cape. t '
[.. Some 'time ago. the correspondent of; the" London
Standard wrote to his paper: "The task .which faces
Lord Kitchener is as heavy/as if is possible to" con-;

Â¦ the_ submission of the Boer leaders,. months of weary,
'fighting are before us. Already there is every. prospect
! of the stock reserves of the two colonies being, wiped
The news is the more interesting because all reports
that immediately preceded it we're to the effect that the
armies of the Boers had been dispersed and that the
British were slowly but surely overtaking and. captur
ing the scattered guerilla bands. Thus, in a dispatch
giving a report of. the operations during the first fif
teen days in May, Lord Kitchener notified the .British
War Department that 115 Boers -had been killed or"
woun"ded,,437 made prisoners and 341 surrendered, an
average of over 50 a day. Besides. this he reported, in
the same period of fifteen days, the* capture of 4
guns, 469,000 rounds of atrimunitiori, 600 wagons and
4300 horses. . . â¢ ." .-,.';Â¦ ; '"V â¢ .'.'
AFTER a "little while of seeming inactivity, and
just when the public lost expectation of any
further exciting news from the Transvaal, the
Boers have again taken the aggressive, have attacked
a British' stronghold at* Vladfontein and, according to
.on"e : report,. have won-a victory and captured six-guns
almost within sight of Pretoria itself. . >'

cite'd ' instances j of other batteries that 'worked .'well 'for

ican Institute of Electrical Engineers. v The exhibition
was accompanied by "a lecture by Dr. A. E. Kennelly,
who is reported to have affirmed that the new battery
is a masterpiece of. simplicity that will remove all ob
jections hitherto made to the bulk and weight of such
batteries when used as an independent propelling
power for vehicles.
It is well known that the electric storage batteries
in use. up to this time have been so bulky and so heavy
that they are unprofitable as a motive power for any
kind of machine that^had to carry" them. Cars run by
such" motors have bpen found to be costly, irregular
and comparatively . slow, j while electric automobiles,
although swift, have also been subject" to the same
objections of: weight and cost.' If the claims made for
the Edison battery; be sustained something like a revo
lution in the propulsion- of vehicles and small '-boats
may be soon accomplished. * / -1 *

The crop outlook continues; good, though it is not
aÂ§ promising as a month or so ago. While this is the
season for crop 'damage reports, which are set afloat
every year by speculators to affect the grain markets 1 ,
it is undeniable that rain is needed in s6me parts of
the West to insure a full yield,, and that the Hessian
fly is cutting down the total in other sections.* But
thus far the damage has hot been 4 serious enough to
produce any 'marked effect on. "quotations, though
wheat has been more buljisji for the past day or' two. .
? In our local market there is, little new to repo-t.
Our crop prospects are still fine. Fruit. is developing
more of a shortage than expected, and it is now ap
parent that the, estimates of damage by the unusually
-severe frosts of April were not exaggerated. The
whtafit â¢ fruit 3'i eld,- with- the exception of peaches, will
be 'lighter than usual this' year, and the cannersare
already. paying. high' prices, for. some varieties in the
, country/ .But the outlook for grain, hay and kindred
products could not be better. The grape crop will be
.short. It is the general expectation that prices for fruit
will be much^ higher tbis year." than last, nor does'
anybody look for very low prices for other product?
of the farm. This creates general confidence in the
future, stimulates the demand for goods, expands
credits, eases collections and makes good times' all
around. . - â¢ ' \
ing offt Heavy rains in the East have interfered with
this line, and have also caused a decrease in the move
ment in -cotton and -.woolen goods and clothing,
though there is more activity in wools and woolens
than in the other fabrics. The cotton plantations are
suffering as the" result of heavy receipts of raw cotton
at the principal markets and a further -reduction .in
quotations at the New' England mills.
General trade conditions, however, continue prom
ising. The labor situation is reported clearing, many
of the May strikes, which hung like a cloud over the
country for weeks ahead, haying been settled," and''
more are being" settled every day. The iron and steel
trades are sending in good reports, most works being
in full operation and new ones starting up. Prices are
stea*dj% but there is no disposition to advance quota
tions. Rails and railway cars, farming tools and struc
tural material are particularly in demand. The boot
and shoe industry is quieting down. Some factories
are suspending operations and shipments show a fall-
r-pÂ»HE weather was rather against business last
Â¦ â¢ I week. The eastern part of: the country com
..Â¦*â¢ plained of lack of warm, sunny weather, and. the
Southwest and Northwest clamored for rain to revive
theraxying crops. All this affected the retail and job
bing distributive trade,.' and the bank clearings
reflected the unfavorable conditions by falling sharply
to a gain of only 21.9 per cent over the same week last
year, whereas the gain for the past two months or so
has been, from 'two to three and even four times av
much. New York recorded an especially sharp de
crease, the increase there over 1000 being only'26.0 per
cent. This loss was due to the flattening out of busi
ness. inAVall street.- Times, are now dull there. All
the steam Uas fizzled cut of the market andnot a-ves-.
tige of the recent boorn remains. 'The public, finding
itself "milked, liquidated, swallowed its. losses with a
wry face, expressed thanks that the matter was no
worse, and left the street. Nor can the public be
induced to return, for the present at least. All of which
,is distressing to the street, and the market reports say
that it is causing the professionals 'much perturbation.'
THE BUSINESS SITUATION.
It. is reported that public opinion in Modoc con
demns the outrage, that good- citizens are. shocked,
that the event is greatly deplored and that the lynch
ers are 'being everywhere denounced. " All of that is
excellent in its way, but it is not enough. California
has a right to expect the Jaw abiding* citizens of
Modoc' to cordially co-operate wj.th the officers of the
law in bringing 'the offenders to justice. , Where so
many persons are engaged in a crime it is not impos
sible to identify and convict at least some of them.
There is no reason, therefore,' why this outrage should
be permitted to pass as a "mysterious crime" com
mitted by "persons unknown." It is in the power of
the people of Modoc to vindicate the law and- the good
name, of California, and it is to be hoped they will
promptly do so. Â¦ .
â¢ So far as .the facts have heen made known not the
slightest excuse can be given for the Modo'c lynching.
Theaccused men were in the.hands of the authorities;
they were to have been tried in the county where their
offenses are alleged to have been committed, and the
law provides ample punishment for any crime of which
they might have been'convictcd. Under such circum
stances the action of the lynchers was a far worse
offense than' anything* of- which the. victims were
accused or suspected, V, r */,"' r^ V" 'â¢'â¢'." ".V.
, The most portentous fact, about the evil is the fre
quency with which it is being resorted to.- It is. no
longer confined to any particular section of the coun
try, or for the punishment of atiy especially abomin
able crime. It has' occurred not only in sparsely' settled
and backward localities, but in some of the most pop
ulous and advanced States in the Union. It has t been
committed for nearly all kinds of suspected offenses,
an.d in the'Modoc case it appears the victims s of the
mob we're accused of nothing worse than petty theft:
This tendency of mobs to violate the law, ignore jus
tice," trample upon every dictate of right and. reason,
and inflict death and not infrequently torture upon
persons who are merely suspected of crime,- is â¢ ah
actual menace to society. It calls for the most earnest
and vigorous efforts on the part of the authorities to
stop it by drastic measures before it becomes even
Â¦more appalling and more menacing. than at present.
THE MODOC LYNCHING.
FOR the welfare of California as well as for the
maintenance of our laws, the perpetrators of. the
lynching! outrage in Morioc County should "be
brdught to the -bar of justice to answer for the crime.
Murder committed under -the -name : of lynch law has
now: become so frequent, in the United States -that -it
can' be no'. longer palliated.or.excusedMn.the old days,
when there '.were vast border districts where
ments had not.beeni organized, aixd -when .lynch -Jaw
was carried out with something of rude justice, it was
tolerated as a sort" of necessary .evil; but those times
have - long passed away and their conditions have
passed with them. At the. present time' there is no
justification whatever for sucK offenses, and they have
now become nothing more nor lessthan crimes which
should be punished by. the severest penalties, ; - â¢"-,; â¢
. A visitor in our midst who was robbed of $5000 by
bUnko steerers says' he is puzzled to understand how
the trick was turned. It is safe to wager that he does
not. wish to repeat the experiment in order. to satisfy
his curiosity. Â¦ . . ? /

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
and Hazel. Green was" a central location
for the mountain trade. Under the. new
management branch .-stores were estab
lished. The business prospered and had it
not been for the construction of the rail
road the partnership might have contin
ued until this day. Floyd Day", however,
saw that Hazel Green's . prestige -.as an
important business center of the moun
tains would pass as soon as the construc
tion of the railroad was completed, and
that Jackson would become the business
center for the mountain country. - Mov
ing to Jackson, he established a store for
general merchandise.
This . parent store now has many
branches through the mountains. The
Jackson store does a large jobbing busi
ness as well as attending to its retail
trade. Mr. Day has another large store
at Clay City, but the others are smaller,
having stocks valued at from J2000 to $5000
each. They are at small stations along
the line of the railroad' and at points
through the_ mountains. The connection
between the lumber business and the busi
ness. of running a number of stores carry
ing a line of general merchandise can be
surmised when the crossties, staves, tan
bark and logs piled around them are seen..
The lumber dealer becomes a merchant
and makes a profit in' both ways. ! Very
.little money is used in the transaction of
business. The mountaineer cuts his trees,
hews out his crossties and splits his
staves from the wood not tit for ties,
strips his tanbark and brings them by
wagon to the general store of the neigh
borhood. He rarely carries away any
money with him. When he returns home
he carries sugar, coffee, lard, bacon, calico
for dresses for his girls and jeans for his
boys. Â¦ . â¢
Merchandise and Lumber.
In. speaking of this trade recently Mr.
Day said: "Of course, it is necessary to
have a man in charge who thoroughly
understands his business. Jn the case of
the larger storts there are two men; one
attends to the portion of the business
which relates to lumber and the other to
the merchandise, department. In -aH of
these stores I require, four accounts
against the name of each man. These- are
under the hearts of sawed lumber, cress
ties, staves and tanhark. It is necessarily
an additional burden in keeping the
books, but it systematizes the business to
such -an extent that I can tell which of
these departments is paying best and,
whether it is, worth while to maintain all
branches of the trade or whether I shall
let drop any department."
Â¦ The Clay City lumber yards" are the
largest in the South. The little town of
the name is about forty miles from Lex
ington, on Red River. This is the largest
plant of the Day & Swan interests and
about 150 hands are employed. There are
large planing mills as well as stave works,
and there has been as much as 10,000,000
feet of lumber stored in the yards at one
time. Poplar lumber is the specialty of
the firm, but large quantities of oak are
sawed as well. The sawmills at the place
have a capacity of about 60,000 feet a day.
The yards' have a private electric plant,
which also furnishes the town with light,
and the large ?tore supplies the wants of
the employes. Day & Swan have mills at
.Beattyville and Natural Bridge as well,
the former running about 50.0U0 feet, the
latter about 30,000 feet a. day. At Jackson
are the mills cf the Day Bros.' Lumber
Company, with a capacity of 40,000 feet,
and at Torrent are the interests of Day
& Congleton: Here are three portable
mills, working now on Walker's Creek.
The capacity of the .three mills Is 30,000
feet a day. ' r " . '
' , Hoads'for Hauling' Logs.*'; .". Â¦. .'
â¢At Natural Bridge the narrow gauge
roads and at Torrent what are called
"tram roads" can be seen in operation.
Mr. Day owns about ten or twelve miles
of narrow gauge road and about .twenty
miles of tram road. It is by this means
that logs are taken to the mills and to
the railroad stations at points where there
are no facilities for sawing. Th.ese roads
are invariably built in creek beds. The
narrow gauge roads are the more durable,
having light weight steel rails and light
ties. Small steam engines operate on
them and pull from six to eight cars of
logs at a time. The tram roads are built
with small saplings for rails and larger
ones for ties. On these roads "mules
draw the cars of logs, bringing between
1000 and 1800 feet at a load.
In the mountains of- Kentucky timber is
necessarily, cut according to the creeks.
These small streams flow down every ra
vine: . Up the' ravine the tram road or the
narrow, gauge road is laid. The timber in
the ravine is first cut. and then the trees
from -the cliffs on either side.
Floating Logs to the Mill.
Where the creeks are large and a'consid
erable amount of water is available the
tram-road method is not" resorted to. The
roads cost from $300 to $-100 a mile in their
construction and have to be abandoned aa
soon as the timber -of the small district
has been cut away.' When possible the
creeks are dammed in rough but effective
fashion and wide sluice-gates are con-'
structed t>f timber sawpd .by hand on the
banks of the stream. Logs are rolled into
the stream and the dam remains closed
until several thousand logs have, collect
ed. The water meantime has backed up
into a small lake, and when the gates are
raised the logs are carried several' mile3
down stream, where another dam again
serves to collect them and supply water
to send them forward. The rivers near
.the headwaters are treated in the same
"fashion. ; â¢ ' .
At Clay City, Beattyvilie and Jackson,
the first being on the Red River and the
other tvro on the north fork of the Ken
tucky River, booms of logs are run along
the shore for the purpose of catching the
timber .floated down stream with the
freshets in the spring and fall. At Jack
son and Beattyville, 60,000 to 70,000 logs are
floated down "and caught in the booms
each year, while at Clay City between
40,000 and 50,000 logs are caught.' .
Mr. Day and hia family reside in a pret
ty home in Jackson. Mr. Day 'â¢ gives this
advice to young men starting in business:
"They should remember two thingsâ first,
to look' after their health: and,' second,
not to -think any detail of ' business too
trivial to merit their personal attention/' '

t Dealing With the Mountaineers. Â¦
Floyd Day, the brain and nerve force of
these'great business interests, is one of
the most kindly, retiring, unobtrusive men
in the district in which he lives. Nearly
six feet In height, v/ith brown eyes and
hair, a nose rather long and thin, droop
ing brown mustache and a complexion al
most as brown, deliberate .in movement
and in speaking, modest almost to a fault,
â¢lie would never be picked out in a crowd
as one capable of directing such an ex
tensive business. His success has taken
away none of his kindly .llsposilion.
Mr: Day has been property called
"the- father of the; mountain poo
ple," in the" sense that he gives each of
nis employes his personal- attention.. The
simple people of the. more remote -dis
tricts see him during his annual rounds,
tell him their difficulties and follow his
advice. Business in the mountains has to
"be conducted on a paternal basis 'that
would cause astonishment in the large
cities. Every year- Mr. -Day sets aside a
certain sum for the profit and loss ac
count, which represents the amount that
he will practically give to -hundreds of
men through the counties of the district
in which, he operates his mills. F.amilies
of the improvident mountaineers almost
starve during the winter. Then the father
of six or seven or even elsht.or nine' or
ten children . comes to . one of the. Day
â¢stores in his neighborhood and gets pro
visions on i,he promise of logs to be cut,
of crossties to be delivered at the store as
soon as the weather will permit of work.
But the premise is more often forgotten
than kept and there is never a rebuke for
the' storekeeiJer when- Mr. Day appears on
his rounds of annual inspectfon. "You did
right; it won't do -to let them suffer," 13
his most frequent comment. '
His First Business -Venture.
Mr. Day was born on Frozen Creek, in
Breathitt County. December 18,: 1854, being
one of a family of nine, five brothers and
four sisters. William Day, his father,
was one 'of the most prosperous men of
the section. He owned large holdings oÂ£
farming and timber lands and engaged. to
a considerable extent in the logging busi
ness. His home was a favorite stopping
place for travelers, who then traversed
the country on horseback, and the big
frame house was therefore. the center of
nev/s from the outer world. Floyd, re
ceived I the common school education of
the county and nothing more. When
about 20 years of age he began work for
himself. .His father's logging bu !e:s,
! however, soon needed his help, and he
was made superintendent of it, serving
thrf:e years in that capacity. During tJiis
time lie made his first, business venture.
Borrowing $50 to make a first payment,
he bought between 300,000 and 400.000 feet
of poplar, trees. â¢ He had the use of his
father's, teams arid wagons and- also the
paternal indulgence to the extent of credit
at his grocery near the home on Frozen
Creek. This was necessary, as almost in
variably the logmen take their pay in
trade at the store. He established a camp
â¢and- went to work with a will. The logs,
were cut and sawed into proper lengths
and rolled into the river, according to
contract." They sold for about $1500, leav
ing a profit of $500 in the hands of the
young man.- ; .
Goods- for Mountain Men, .
Shortly after this time he moved to Ha
zel Green, a small town in Wolfe County,
where his eldest brother, J. Y. Day. con :
ducted a grocery. For. three years the
younger brother worked as a clerk.' Then
he bought a grocery of his*o.wn for $5000.
He paid his entire savings, $1000 in cash,
and gave a mortgage on the business for
the rest -.*-.* Â¦ --â¢'Â¦.Â¦
The father in the meantime divided a
portion of .his land â¢ among: his -sons.
Floyd's share amounted to $3oOO when sold,
and with -this and his earnings all debt
was removed : from his business. After
four years the , two Tarothers consolidated

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS
Prepared by Experts and Specialists for
The effect of taxing public bonds is even- worse. in
California than in New York, for it not only lowers
the value of the bonds, but it drives them out of the
State into the hands of outside holders,- and we "thus
lose the tax we put upontheni and the interest we pay
upon them. It. is, in fact, a losing business all around,
and the amendment should undoubtedly be again sub
mitted to the people and a thorough campaign of
education' made to explain its purposes and its merits.
* The third and final resolution urges a resubmission
to the people'of the proposed, amendment to the conr
stitution providing for. the exemption from. taxation^
StateY county, municipal andjschbbl- bonds, and re-,
solves .-^- V* / : ; ';';:* '''.''^ â¢'
"That the California Bankers'. Association take. all
honorable means to instruct the voters of this State of .'
the benefits that. may be derived by the. adoption" of an
amendment to the constitution of our State exempting..
from taxation State, county, municipal and school
bonds." : ." Â¦ t ? ' "V "' Â¦â¢ \' . Â¦ â¢Â¦
The legislation recommended in each] and all of the
resolutions. will. tend directly to the general good. It
is undeniable that great inconvenience will result to a
considerable, number of persons if incorporated banks
or other corporations be forced to go through liquida
tion upon the expiration of the term of their articles
before they can obtain an extension. It is equally
evident that financial business will be greatly facili
tated if our laivs governing negotiable instruments.be'
made uniform, with those of the great States of the
East, with which the bulk of our- trade is carried on.
Of the third resolution it may be said that while the
vote of the people against the amendment exempting
public bonds from taxation shows that it is difficult to
clear the minds of the voters from misconceptions
concerning" the incidence of taxation, it is nevertheless
worth while to continue the campaign of education.
California loses so much by the present law that the
repeal of it is a matter of prime importance. ..,
An object lesson on the- subject is afforded by the
recent experience, of the city of New York in selling
bonds to the amount of .$3,855,000. . The bonds,.bear
ing 3 r A per cent interest, brought a much smaller
premium " than was expected, and . the New York
Times, in commenting upon the Â«ale, said: .
"Under the conditions of previous sales the bonds
sold on Tuesday should have brought. 108 or no. In
expressing his disappointment the Controller said that'
at least 75 per cent of the, fair in the. price of city
bonds was due to laws passed by the Legislature. The
laws of the session of 1901 in reference to taxation, he
declared, 'have cost the city of New York on this one
bond 'sale alone $300,000.' He specified in particular
the law imposing a tax of 1 per cent on the trust com
panies . * * * It- appears, therefore, that while the
â¢city was.able in January to. borrow money at 2.93 per
cent interest, and oh previous issues of bonds even at
a lower rate, it must now, by reason of the new tax
laws, pay something over 3 1-3 per cent. The trust
companies, which are among the chief buyers of city
bonds, have simply shifted the tax, or as much of it
as they are able to shift, upon the general taxpayers."
The second resolution deals with the important
problem of providing throughout the Union some
thing like uniform. laws governing negotiable instru
ments. This is a reform that has long been desired by
all classes of business men, and considerable progress
has been' made in attaining it, as many States have so
revised their laws as tobring them into harmony. The
resolution asks the Code Commission to make- such
amendment to our laws as will place us on an equality
with other progressive States in that respect.
'j-^ Y. the California Bankers' Association, at the
H^ annual convention in San Jose last week, there
,1â/ w^ s 'adopted a series' of resolutions which merit
the consideration and the support of the people. They
are in the nature, of suggestions for legislation in the
financial interests not of bankers only but ,pf the whole
b'usinesiVworld, and* as they cannot be accomplished
except' through the Legislature and the votes of the
citizensVthey- should be borne in mind so that ample
support will be found for'them when the time comes
for action. . . â¢ -.. ' / â¢'
. The first resolution refers to the approaching time,
wrfen the corporate existence of a number of banks
wjll' be terminated," arid points out the desirability of
permitting them to renew their existence without hav
ing to go through liquidation. The benefits accruing
from such a privilege would, of course, be shared by
depositors and all persons .doing, business with the
banks* It is, therefore, resolved to ask the enactment
of a law by the next .Legislature authorizing in some
form, at the option of the parties interested, the exten
sion of the corporate existence of corporations.

mands are briefly as follows: ...
The engine room complement to be classed as
a military branch.
Prince Adalbert, son of. Emperor "Wil
liam, who recently joined the navy, has
received his first lesson in naval disci
pline. The youngster had. a terrier as a
constant companion and the dog followed
Its master on board the training ship. The
captain objected to the. dog's presence as
contrary to the regulations, but the younpr
Prince demurred against .being 1 subjected
to a strict interpretation of navy law in
hi3 case, which, he contended, might ap
ply to other ordinary officers, but not lr>
a Prince. The captain wrote to' the Em
peror, who in turn notified his sailor son
to submit to navy regulations, and the
dog was sent ashore. : . .."..* .'.
The Belleville boiler, originally intended
for seven ships in course of construction
for the British navy, will be displaced
by some other type legs objectionable. The
battleship Queen is to have large Yarrow
boilers, and a sister ship, the Prince o*
"Wales," will- be fitted wKh Babcock and
Wilcox boilers. The Encounter, a second
class cruiser, is to have' the Durr-Thorr
eycroft boilers, and "a sloop named Merlin
will be fitted with Niclausse boilers.
Sixteen ironclad vessels . have been
struck off the active navy, list of Great
Britain durjng the past fiscal year, name
ly: Achilles. Aginceur.t. Audacious, Black
Prince, Belleisle, Invincible. Iron Duke,
Hydra. Minotaur. Nelson, Northampton.
Neptune. Northumberland. Swiftsure. Tri
umph and "Warrior. There still remain
eighteen ironclads built from, thirty to
twenty years ago, the utility, of which
has ceased long ago, but are still retainer!
on the active list. as. a part of their'bat
teries consist of breech-loading gun3.
while, the sixteen vessels retired were
armed solely with muzzle-loaders. â¢ .
The Reina Mercedes, which was sunk in
Santiago harbor July. 4. 1S38, and after
ward raised and towed to the United
States, is to be extensively repaired and
fitted with new machinery to become a
training ship. In view of the fact that
our navy has several cruisers which the
advances of recent years have made next
to obsolete, It appears not to bo econom
ical nor'wise to expend half a million, dol
lars on a vessel built fourteen years- ago.
The new- 9.2-inch gun made at Elswick
has a recQtd.cf firing five shots in one
minute. This, of course. Is not to be ac
cepted as its capability, on board ship, but
one round per minute will be Quite satis

Gains and losses on both sides were re
ported in the matter of the bakers' strike.
The employes seem eo far to have the
better of the situation. The men will re
port for work twenty-four hours after
leaving- Their demand is for seven days'
pay for six days' work and they are confi
dent of securing this concession.
A long and practically technical sched
ule of wages was adopted. In some
branches of the trade nine hours was
adopted; in others ten. Some men may
commence work in the early hours of the
morning, others later in the day; but the
schedule. : say the journeymen, must be
observed". In the event of the Inability of
the employers to secure a union man, a
non-union man may be employed. Instead
of demanding notification immediately
when a question of emergency work is
raised; the employer is relieved of respon
sibility of reporting the matter.
On the usual working days the ten-hour
limit will prevail and on Saturdays and
days preceding holidays thirteen hours
shall constitute a- aay's labor. Sausage
makers are to work ten hours daily u..u
slaughter house men nine hours.
"If the proprietors do not wish to put
out the union card, and are willing to
accede to our other demands, we will be
satisfied," said .Secretary May. ; "Some of
"the proprietors *could not afford to put out
this card, so we are willing. to meet them
half-way. We feel, though, that we have
our contentions won. About hiring non
union help our position has been mis
represented. If the tosses cannot find a
union man, let them take the first best
man they can get, and then we will try
to make him a union man."
It was reported by Secretary May that
all employers could agree to accept the
union rules and rates of wages except as
to the displaying of the union card. Some
friction is expected until this matter is
adjusted. The members will meet every
night at the Turk-street Temple until the
details are adjusted.
Differences between employing and em
ployed butchers are likely to be settled
without any strike. Concessions are be
ing made on both sides and the ten-hour
working day asked by the workingmeu,
except in a very few -instances, is likely
to be granted. The Journeymen Butchers
met at the Turk-street Temple yesterday
afternoon and so modified their demands
that the proprietors of butcher shops who
are willing to give the working' hours and
the pay asked may display the union card
or not as they see fit.

proved to ' be some old petticoats tied
around a piece of a pile. - *
â¢ The ferry steamship Tamalpais is not
a success Â¦ and she has- been withdrawn
from the Sausalito run to see if some de
fects in her construction can bo rectified.
Her paddles are fitted with feathering
buckets, and when the vessel is gong
ahead these work well, but when going
astern they will not feather, and the-ves
sel Is nearly jarred to pieces. This is the
defect the builders are trying to remedy.
The steamship* purchased by ;ho Ger
mans to run- between Apia and Honolulu
is the Ringarooma, not Ringraroons., as
given in Samoan dispatches. She is a
small vessel of 623 tons net burden. 215
feet long, 30 feet beam and 14 fe^t Oeep.
She. was built in England in i.875. Her
name is to be changed to Samoa, and she
will run under the German lias.
Water Front Notes.
A big crowd on Meiggs wharf watched
an interesting race between two crab
boats yesterday. James Sennett and W.
Barlow are two of the boatmen -al the
foot of Powell street, and last week they
made a match to sail a race from oft the
barge office around Blossom- Rock, back
to the barge office, thence around Anita
Rock and back to the barge office. The
race wzts to be sailed in two of the crab
fishermen's boats, the winner. to receive a
$10 purse. Sennett won the race with six
minutes to spare. A strong breeze was
blowing .and the winner showed hmi c elf
more familiar with the kind of craft he
was handling than did his competitor.
Raced in Crab Boats..
THIS steamship Charles D. Lane
got away fur Nome, via Seattle,
on time yesterday. There was
a big crowd dowji to see her
away and' Captain Dunlevy had
a squad of police on the wharf 'n antici
pation of trouble. Two officers in a
Whitehall boat patrolled the slip in which
the vessel lay and followed the craft in
to the stream. Everything passed off
quietly, however, and the Lane is now
well on her way to 'Puget Sound.
The vessel took away auite a number of
passengers, the majority of whom are
men going north to work Mr. Lane's min
ing claims. Charles D. Lane himself went
along and says that work will bes;iii in
earnest as soon as he reaches Nome. Off
Melggs wharf a thorough search was
made- for stowaways, but not cne could
be found. Outside, however, two made
their appearance on deck and Captain
Ames at once gave orders to transfer
them to the pilot boat. One of the stow
aways ran to a gangway and disappeared
and could not be found. The other was a
negro boy and he begged so hard that
Mr. Lane told the captain to let him work
his way as a cabin boy. â¢ â¢ . â¢ â¢ "
The troubles of the Lane began with
the machinists' strike. When the ! men
walked out she required a new- shaft and
her machinery- had to be overhauled.' At
one time it looked as if she would not go
north this year, but the bosses oÂ£ tho
machine shops came to the rescue. They
took off their coats" and with the assist
ance of a few outsiders' completed the re
pairs and last Thursday had the steam
ship ready for sea. There was much r-ard
feeling over the matter and at one time it
was feared that something- might be done
to the machinery in order "to prevent the
vessel going to sea. The police were
called up and a watch kept from Friday
evening until the Lane sailed yesterday.

"Three days out from Hilo a hawk
came aboard and stayed with the ship
for four days. How the bird got so far
out to sea is a mystery. We were all
of 700 miles from land, and that is a
long fly, even for a hawk. When the sail
o-s saw the bird they felt better," and
said it had been sent to take away the
hoodoo. For four days the bird stayed
/around, and during that time I never
had better sailing weather in my life.
j Every stitch of canvas â¢ drew, and for
ninety-four hours the, men never took a
! pull on a brace. Then one night the
hawk . disappeared, and for a week we
had baffling winds that would have made
a saint swear. What became of the bird
is a mystery, but maybe he flew to some
other vessel of the sugar fleet. ' .
""With the disappearance â¢ of the hawk
all the men's superstitions came back;
but everything moved along quietly un
*il last Saturday night, when a gale
came up in a few minutes. A big sea
flooded the decks and washed all the
rope ends out through the portholes. Be
fore the men could get hold of the braces
the pressure of the sail broke the fore
topgallant yard in the sling, one of the
lower topsails split, a jib was blown out
of the bolt-ropes, and 'I was nearly wash
ed out of the jigger rigging. I was aloft
looking for the Farallone light when the
wave climbed around me and gave me
a soaking from which my clothes are
still wet.. It blew so hard that under
topsails we were making ten knots, so
I had to heave the ship to and wait for.
morning. The men are satisfied now.
They knew that three hoodoos meant
some mishap, and Saturday night's
breeze has convinced them they were
right."
Among those who came up on the Falls
of Clyde are S. G. Walker, and wife, Miss
M. Margetts, Miss Hilton. John Akau
and H. L. Achilles and wife.
"We made a splendid run of twelve
days to Hllo." said the Clyde's Jolly
master, "and I fully expected to come
home in thirteen days or less. The
crew swears we would have done it, too,
had It not been for three hoodoos. First,
w^ sailed on a Friday. Jack passed
that over until he counted noses and
found we had thirteen passengers aboard.
Then the men swore by Neptune that
there would be trouble before the voy
age was over.
The best run was made by the four

HOODOOS DELAY
FALLS OF CLYDE
LONDON. June 2.â AH Indications point
to a rational resumption of business, on
the Stock Exchange in the near future.
There is no reason why this should have
been delayed as long as it has, except
* that London recovers| slowly, and there
fore the effect of the recent panic has
been a week during which transactions
have been decidedly dull. New York has
continued sending higher prices, and
these were marked up here in a per
functory fashion, but .actual business
has been very small. Leading critics
now point out that the material pros
pects of the United States, which caused
the recent advance, in stocks, are as
{rood as even and that the interests of
the "community of interest" campaign
that is essential to the development of the
American railways system is certain to
cause higher prices.
London's Northern Pacific settlement is
now practically completed, and money is
easy. Home rails are dull, and Ameri
can securities offer the most attractive
rield for operations. The depression in
home rails Is due to unfavorable traffic
reports; the recent holiday period did
not bring the traffic improvement ex
pected. .\
The decided ease in money. was due" to
immense Government disbursements, and
there are confident predictions of an
early reduction In the. bank rate. The
Government, however, owing to the large
amount of foreign money which might be
withdrawn if money oversharpened, is
cautious.
It is reported that Berlin is investing
In Chinese bonds, owing to the clearing
of the political atmosphere in the Orient.
Quotations Lower on Berlin Bourse.
BERLIN. June 2.â It is a significant
fact that the announcement of the with
drawal of the allied troops from China,
which the Bourse had long expected,
would give an impetus to business, was
almost wholly- without influence upon
trading last week. Its only effect was
tj increase transactions in Chinese loans
at rising Quotations.
In all departments the Bourse had a
very bad week, with lower quotations
everywhere. The causes were the un
satisfactory reports from the Iron cen
ters and the general industrial situation.
The weakest spot in the market was the
iron section. All iron shares fell off,
the decline in some instances reaching
seven points.
The general industrial situation is re- '
parded as less favorr.ole. Canadian Pa
cific developed strength upon the in
creased earnings, but Northern Pacifies
were neglected.
The Prussian Government has an order
for 305 locomotives, at an aggregate cost
cf 17,500,000 marks.

BALLARD, June 2.â The farmers of the
Santa Ynez VaHey are beginning to har
vest the heaviest and best crop raised In
fifteen years. The outlook at one time
was anything but promising, but the
splendid x rains during the last days of
April performed wonders and thousands
of acres of grain now await the header
and thresher. â¢ Â¦ - â¢
Santa Ynez Grain Abundant.
Warrants will be procured to-day for
the â¢ arrest ' of ; a number of the soldiers
who took part in the riot of Friday night,
and they will be served on the offenders
as soon as they are mustered out.
' To secure evidence i that the pro
prietors of- the groggeries were break
ing the laws ' was an easy Â¦â¢"- matter.
Three police officers wearing the uni
forms of soldiers entered the places
and purchased numerous rounds pf
drinks, which were served without any
questioning.
Ample evidence was secured by the of
ficers, and they swore to warrants for
the arrest of Adolph Rehfeld, Otto Weln
hold and Leon Borel. The warrants were
served yesterday by Officer Pete Fan
ning. Â¦Â¦>,:. . '
Rehf eld's corner has been a source of
trouble -to the police - for the last three
years, and the news, of his arrest afford
ed the officers at the Presidio great sat
isfaction. His place was burned down
by the soldiers two years ago, and he
has been threatened repeatedly with trou
ble since resuming business.
The soldiers of .the Forty-fifth Regi
ment were confined to their camp yester
day, and a strong guard was placed -to
keep out all visitors. The guard- of
mounted artillerymen patrolled the streets
last night and prevented the gathering
in any one spot of many soldiers. It was
feared that a repetition of the attack of
Friday night would be made. The men,
however, were disposed to be orderly,
and made no trouble.

Game Full of Blunders PoorlyPlayed
at the Capital.
SACRAMENTO. June 2.â Sacramento
took the series by defeating the cripples
again to-day by a score of 13 to 8. The
game was of the amateur order, and a
series of blunders from start to finish,
with just enough hard hitting to make it
endurable; and.it dragged along for two
hours and a half. MoEkiman officiated
for Oakland, and was hit safely four
teen times, while Doyle, who twirled for
Sacramento, was found thirteen times,
and both men walked seven players. The
score:

HOBNDfG GAME.
The latter game was scientific to the
core, the work devolving upon both pitch
ers, who labored in glorious fashion in
the box. Hartwell, the Angel twirler.
pitched remarkable baseball one inning
after the other and Iburg came close to
a perfect imitation of It. The Orangeman
etruck out six men, allowed but two hits
and gave two men free transportation.
Iburg's hitting allowance was three hits,
passing one and striking out one.
To him. is accredited the single run of
the day. Reaching the first bag In the
third inning on a hit to left, he skirted
to third on Bowman's error and scored
latterly on Hildebrand's out.
Hlldebrand forced a cheer from the
crowd by the one featural play of the
day. With Hutchlnson on second. House
holder sent the ball out. to the far-away
left field. Hildebrand brought the spheroid
down by a remarkable one-hand catch.
This saved the game for San Francisco
just as Bowman's error, allowing the ball
to slip through his hands, lost it for Los
Angeles.- The score:

.TACOMA. Wash., June 2.'â Reports re
ceived to-d.ay from Wilkeson throw fur
ther light on the probable motive for the
poisoning of Vincent Burgis, or Hen
dricksÂ» last week by his young bride. It
Is claimed at Wilkeson that Stella Worc
zek, the girl, waa sold by her father, who
was paid $300 by Burgis. The girl was in
love with another Hungarian named Joe
Rye, and objected to being delivered to
Burgis. Her father is said to have, com
pelled her to accede to h-is wishes and In
spite of her reluctance she wedded Bur
gis last Sunday night.
It was noticed that the girl took little
part in the wedding festivities. Indicating
that she was brooding over her sorrow at
being compelled to marry a man she did
not love. The Idea of using poison is
eaid to have been suggested to her by an
other Hungarian woman, who once tried
to poison herself in consequence of do
mestic trouble. - â¢ â¢ .
â¢ The "Wllkeson people who give this ver
sion claim that Burgis demanded the re
turn of his $300 by the girl's- father, but
the latter had rpent the money.

SAY THE BRIDE
WAS PURCHASED
ALTHOUGH but three organiza
tions had official shooting con
tests at the Shell Mound ranges
yesterday,. candidates for honors
in the international shooting fes
tival were present in hundreds from early
morning until the sun set behind the hills
of San Francisco. The time set for the
bund shoot is but "six weeks distant and
all of the large clubs have some of their
crack shots practicing every day.
All of the old-time marksmen who have
won honors in other international con
tests are in the best of trim and promise
to eclipse all previous performances. Dark
horses are appearing daily among the
younger shots and some of them are said
by the local bund officials to be in line for
some of the best prizes. The local lovers
of the sport are consequently expecting
that many marksmen from San Francisco
will stand pre-eminent among the crack
shots of the world after the festival.
New and valuable prizes are being re
ceived from time to time, but still there
are many lacking from the desired num
ber. It Is expected however, that this'
difficulty will be overcome within the next
month at most. The ranges have been
put in the best of condition and several
new buildings have been erected in antici
pation of the event.
'The organizations which shot yesterday
were Companies D and L, First Infantry,
National Guard of California, and the
Deutscher Krieger Verein. The scores
â¢were as follows.:

Some years ago Lee, who claims to be
a regularly licensed doctor, was arrested
while trying to dispose of twenty thou
sand dollars' worth of bonds which had
been stolen'in Kansas City. He claimed
that they were given to him by a friend
to seH*and as the police were unable 'to
show/that he knew the bonds had been
sto.len, he was given his freedom.
Â¦ When Captain Seymour learned that
Lee had got away he ordered his men. to
continue the search and spare no effort
to land him. Lee, learning that the de
tectives were after him, telephoned to
Captain Seymour last evening and in
quired if he was wanted. Seymour told
him he was anxious to see him, and in
vited him to pay him a visit.
Lee visited the Hall of Justice and- was

greyhounds well up in the game and with

but one story to tell and he repeated It
without change. One after the other of
the clever lot had to succumb to the pace
of the brilliant performer and when, in
the deciding course, the final flag was
raised, the result showed that the stake

his opponents without a single point be
ing scored against him.
â¢The one Â¦ noticeable feature of the win

The young man who has to scratch for
a living seldom sows any wild oats.
Young Dingwell was a student at the.
Central High School, particularly apt- and
clever, with a decided bent toward . theat
ricals. Ever since childhood he has mani
fested a keen Interest In everything that
flavored of the stage. He was the leader
in many amateur â¢ theatrical entertain
ments and had gone so far as . to write
plays that" were subsequently produced by
his young companions, under his own di
rection and supervision.
At home his leisure time was occupied
in constructing scenic eets and building
stage mechanical -appliances. i â¢ Â¦
.His parents saw nothing harmful in his
boyish ambitions. Although they had
never given him any special encourage
ment.'no obstacles had been thrown In his
way to prevent I him from" employing .his
youthful talents in the direction he had
selected.
Friday afternoon the lad went home
from school and at 4 o'clock left the house
to go to an evening, newspaper office to
handle his route, which he waÂ« serving to
earn money for his theatrical endeavors.
Dingwell dld'not arrive as usual . at the
office and he has not since been seen
at home. He departed 'without a word of
warning. He left without taking any
clothing excepting the: garments he wore;
and to no one, so far as the family and
the police have been able to learn, did he
.confide his intention to depart. .
Â¦ ."We cannot Imagine what Induced the
boy to â¢ leave," â¢ said the father, a promi
nent building contractor of this city, "un
less It be that his. ambition to go on the
stage has mastered his good sense. He
had everything at home that a boy could
expect to .have and .was j a. lad of good
morals and habits." â¢Â» .'.-.â¢ .

THERE is a good play spoiled in
Grace Livingston and A*bby Sage
Richardson's comedy "A Colonial
Girl," presented this week by the
James N'eill company at the Cali
fornia Theater. The first act is a charm
ing bit of comedy, picturesque in. inci
dent and plausibly built The second act
Is loosely constructed and overcrowded
with characters, wiâle the third act drops
into pure melodrama.
The story deals with colonial days, and
every possible picturesqueness cf the
time has been levied upon for the inci
dents of the plot. â¢ A j-oung scapegrace
returns from England to Xew York . to
find himself "heir to a stern uncle, who
has left him large estates. He finds,
also, that his cousin, with whom he is
in love, has married an old man for his
â¢wealth and title. Stung into madness at
this latter discovery, he marries a charm-
Is* young girl that fate (in the shape of a
couple of sturdy ruffians) has thrown in
his way on the day of his return and dis
covery. A charming scene takes place
between these two. The girl. " Molly
Heddin (Julia Dean). . daughter of an old
soldier friend of the disappointed lover
(James Neill), mistakes the house of the
hero for a tavern, and, after her res
cue, innocently orders dinner there. Sup
posing her rescuer to be- a poor soldier,
though knowing him to be the nephew
of his uncle, and Godfrey Remsen by
name, she also orders dinner for him,
and then confides that she has run away
for a day from the home farm, where
she is tyrannized over by a cruel step
mamma. At this unconventional feast,
charmed by the simplicity and kindli
ness of the country girl; Godfrey con
ceives the idea of making good a boast
of his on receipt of the news of his
cousin's marriage â that he, too, was Just"
on the point of being married. He there
fore asks the roma;nic little person trom
ihe country to be his wife, and she, with
head full of tl)<> point-lace romances; of
the time, joyfully consents. The scene
end? v.-lth the entrance upon the scene of
Lady Danvcrs, tb<* first" love, who is
Btfll in love y."ith Godfrey, arrd who in
forms her poor little rival, that -.her hus
band has married -her out of pique. The
music then begins, and the plot is fur
ther complicated by Godfrey- becoming
involved m the plot of the Rebellion.
Lady Danven betrays him, and impli
cates his wife (who wcuW have nothing
to do with him after Lady Danvers'
declaration of his love for her) in the
transaction. It all ends happily, how
ever, and just misses being, a clever
crmedy.
James XeiH is well s=een as the lover,
though it is by no' means one of his best
parts. One of the best bits of acting Is
done by John W. Burton as a peppery old
colonel with a ratner overtorrld vocabu
lary. Frank McVickars is an excellent
Â¦old family servant,"' a faithful and. per
sistent husybody. Jack Osborne is over
emphasized, thoug-h on the right side of
impulsiveness.
Lady Danvers was given with the right
melodramatic touch by Miss Edythe
Chapman, -and Julia Dean gave a dainty
and delicate interpretation of the part
of Molly Heddin. The work of Mary
Elizabeth Fort>es shows promise as
*Lady Sarah Ketelas, but her diction
stands in much need of improvement.

THE 'many friends of "W.'J.:At
tridge, a promising young.attor
ney, were shocked to learn upon
the arrival of the last transport
from j Manila that he had died
there, supposedly of fever. Two years
ago he was seriously ill from an attack
of appendicitis, but recovered and did not
seem to suffer trom any after effects. He
was - at that time assistant prosecuting
attorney in Judge Conlan's .court, 'Â¦', in
which office he made hosts of friends.
The deceased was a past president of
Presidio Parlor, Native Sons of the Gold
en "West, and always took a warm Inter
est in the success of the parlor. He. had
political aspirations while here and if
he had remained he would have been" a
leading candidate for the office of Justice
of the Peace. He retired in favor of a
friend prior to trie nominations for the
last election. He> left for Manila some
months ago, end it -was understood by
his friends that he was to secure a judge
ship there, for which he was eminently
qualified. Although quite a young man.
he had the happy faculty of making and
keeping friends and his untimely end will
I be sincerely mourned by them. He was
born in this city.
MURDER OF LITTLE ROBBIE HISLOP
STILL REMAINS A DEEP MYSTERY
Police Have Nearly Given Up Hope of Arresting the Fiend.
Silly Story (in a Yellow Paper a Rank Fake.
It is extremely doubtful if ; the brutal
.murderer of Robbie ' Hlslop will 'ever; be
caught. The police, after following up
every clew, have about realized the hope
lessness of their task and -are' ready to
admit that they are up: against it.
'.."It is the deepest mystery I have ever
had to deal with," ( said; Captain of De
tectives Seymour last night. "We have
all along worked in the dark, hoping to
get. some tangible clew to the perpetrator
of the awful crime, but without success.
As far as the identity of the murderer is
concerned we know as much about it now
as we did when we first worked on the
case. However, there is always a hope
that something will turn up that will
eventually lead to the apprehension . of
the fiend.". . -â : - ",'.'Â¦'.Â¦ ,.
The silly story published in a" yellow
paper that the hatchet which is in the
possession of the- police was the prop
erty of a man who had killed some chick
ens in the lot opposite the Hislop resi
dence on the , afternoon of I the murder
caused laughter in police circles yester
day, i It was stated -in the article that
three boysâ Harry Qulnn of 34 Octavla
street, Lester Conn, 71 Halght street, and
George Benton. 102 Octavfa street, saw
the man enter the lot, take four chickens
out of a box and chop their, heads off.
It was also claimed that the man left
the hatchet behind him. . This hatchet,
the yellow sheet claimed, was the ; one
-that was found in the lot by the police
and which is supposed to be the one used
by the murderer. . .
The three boys were Interviewed by
Detective Tom Gibson yesterday and they
all gave the lie to the story. They were
unanimous in declaring that the episode
happened on Decoration day and not on
the afternoon of the murder, as the story
read.. After killing the chickens the man
picked up their headless bodies, and
placing the bloody hatchet under his arm
walked away. This was all. there was to
the incident.' , Â¦
The hatchet which the police think was
used by the murderer still awaits an
owner. Hundreds of people have exam
ined it, but not one had ever seen it be
fore. . Captain Seymour is Inclined to be
lieve that the owner does not read the
newspapers and knows nothing about the
awful tragedy, or that, fearing notoriety,
he does not want 'his identity known-

FOOTPADS ROB
AND BEAT GIRL
Miss A. Williams Held
Up Near Her Home
in Oakland.
Choked and Relieved of
Her Valuables.
Knocked Down, After Being
Captain Petersen of the Oakland Police
Department sent oui. a posse of policemen
to scour the city for the two footpads; but
up to a late hour they had not been ap
prehended.
The force of the brutal punch sent the
girl reeling to the ground, where the
brace of robbers left her and quickly made
their escape. HaJf-consclous, she strug
gled to her feet and theji managed to at
tract attention of pedestrians on the op
posite side of he street. She was assisted
to her home and then the police were
called. Miss Williams' face was badly
bruised from, the blows. She could give
only a meager description of her assail
ants.
Miss Williams screamed once and then
struggled to free herself rfom the robber's
grasp, biting his finders in the fight; He
involuntarily released his hold, but only
for a second, as his companion with an
oath snatched the bag from the belt and
then struck the girl heavily on the head.
The first highwayman then threw the girl
from him and "No. 2 again dealt Miss
Williams a heavy blow In the face with
his fist. -
Directly across the street from the
scene of the robbery, In Madison square,
were numbers of people enjoying the
bright moonlight- night. , The one scream
the girl gave as the footpads grabbed and
throttled her was heard in the park, but
none paid sufficient heed to the. cry to
go to the assistance of the helpless young
woman. The robbers grabbed a chate
laine bag that dangled from her waist
belt and made off with the plunder, after
beating Miss Williams on the head and
face. The purse contained $1 50.
Miss Williams had been calling on
friends and was hurrying down Madison
street toward her home. She noticed two
young men on the same side of the street,
but paid no attention to them. Just as
she passed the crossing at Ninth street
the men separated quickly and without
a word one of them /grabbed her by the
throat with one hand and quickly threw
her head back, putting his other , hand
over her mouth.
Miss Augusta Williams, a stenographer,
residing at 865 Madison street, Oakland,
was held up and robbed at 10:30 o'clock
last night by two footpads, after she had
made a plucky fight and had been .bru
tally beaten by the pair ' of desperadoes.'
The robbery occurred at Ninth and Madl-'
son streets, within a block of the young
woman's home, under the shadow of the
trees that line the sidewalk. â¢ Â¦
Jones of Stockton made a hurried trip
to Oakland late last night and induced
Deputy County Clerk C. F. Pugh to pro
vide them with a marriage license.
Brown gave his age as 33 ,Â»nd the girl
confessed to 20 years. After securing the
license they departed to find a clergyman
to tie the matrimonial knot. They did
not confide in Mr. Pugh the reason of
their haste to be made one or any details
as to their identity. .
