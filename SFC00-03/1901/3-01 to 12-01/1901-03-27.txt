Hear Play Read and Judge
Its Morality.
PARIS, March 26.â The Chamber of Dep
uties is soon to have a novel experience.
A comedy which has been condemned by
the censor as immoral will be read in. its
hearing. During the last few months the
censor has been unusually active. A num
ber of plays have been refused by him
and three have very recently been con
demned. This has led to some outcry
against the censor.
Jean Drault. a playwright and newspa
per man, has been notified that a comedy
which, he recently submitted to the censor
has been rejected, and a friendly Socialist
Deputy, Charles Bernard, who has taken
the matter up, 'announces that he will
bring the subject before the Chamber, as
he understands that the charge of immor- 1
ality is a mere pretext for rejection, the"
real reason being that the comedy scath
ingly critiqjzes the Cabinet.
- M. Bernard intends to read the play be
fore the Deputies that they may have an
opportunity to judge. In this he will be
seconded ,by Joseph Laies, anti-Semite,
who will Interpellate the Government on
the method of choosing censors, whom he
intends to arraign as lacking literary ca
pacity. Â¦_, . - - _ Â¦-'

ORDER COMES OUT
OF RUIN'S CHAOS
COLUMBUS, March 26.â The Supreme
Court to-day dealt a death blow to
the so-called debenture business In Ohio.
In the quo warranto proceedings brought
by the Attorney General against the In
terstate Investment Company of Cincin
nati, the court entered judgment of
ouster. The decision is based upon the
finding of the court that the methods
employed by the debenture â¢ companies
are those of a lottery: that /they are
fraudulent, contrary to public policy and
unlawful. Five of the six Judges concur
in the judgment, and the sixth, .Judge
Shauck. does not dissent.
Assistant Attorney General Todd, who
has had charge of the case for the State,
said to-day that in his belief the nine
debenture companies of Ohio will attempt
to do no further business. Applications
for receiver* for most of them have al
ready been made.
The companies' aggregate deposits in'
the State Treasury, now -amount to about
5539,000. According to their own reports
the aggregate liabilities to debenture
holders amount to approximately $2,000,
000. The assets claimed by the
corporations, other than the deposits with
the State Treasurer, amolint to about
$300,000.
Supreme Court's Syllabus.-
The syllabus of the Supreme" Court In
the case is as follows:
Contracts of Investment security, deben
tures or certificates which, by the device of a
â¢numeral part." may, be called in and re
deemed at any period before they would reg
ularly accumulate a credit In the reserve
Ivnd equal to the stipulated endowment
value- and otherwise jrlvlng unequal advantage
to the certificate holders contain elements of
chance and prize constituting a lottery and are
wlawful.
<Jbatrmcts of Investment security, debentures
cr certificates which cannot reasonably be ex
pected to "accumulate a sufficient reserve fund
-to equal 'the stipulated endowment values
within the staled period without aid from
lapses or appropriation from premiums on new
-tijs1ni?aÂ» - are - fraudulent.- contrary to public
1'ollcy and unlawful.
A comprehensive review of the court's
reasons for reaching its conclusion that
the business of the debenture companies
is fraudulent is presented in the opinion
prepared by Judge Davis. The court
says :
Reasons for Judgment.
The question here Is not whether the pro
moters of the defendant company have inten
tionally devised a scheme to mislead and de
fraud, but -whether that is the effect of it. The
I.romoters and the investors may be self-de
luded or satisfied to take the chance offered,
but that does not altar the character of the
scheme. If the company is misusing its cor
1-erate privileges in such <t way as to be a
public abuse the writ must issue, regardless
of the intent.
An inspection of the different classes of
"accumulative endowment certificates" Issued
tc 'â¢ the defendant discloses that in none of
them does a certificate absolutely and certain
ly mkture within any fixed and definite period,
yet the certificates are all so drawn as t.o cre
ate the expectation and to make it appear
that they will mature 1n a period of 120
months. With all the light which we have
received from counsel and other sources we
have been unable to persuade ourselveÂ« that
the credit -to any of these classes of certifi
cates In the reserve fund or the reserve or
tontine funds will equal the endowment value
vlthln the stipulated periods without the aid
of lapses or the apportionment of dues de
rived from new business. Indeed, it is almost
eclf-evident that with 75 or 80 per cent of the
premiums received consumed In expenses and
monthly redemptions the reserve credits could
rot equal the endowment value in several
times the periods stipulated. In other words,
20 or K per cent of the premiums, with its in
terest earnings alone and unaided . by lapses
or the appropriation of money from premiums,
received for new business, will not sufficiently
cccumulate to equal the represented endow
ment value in the stipulated periods. A
scheme which can succeed only by lapses is
manifestly a scheme which will enrich some
at. the expense of others who embark In the
t.atne enterprise. The percentage of 'afrses
varies with different companies and at differ
ent times wilh the same company. Shall this
fallacious and uncertain - element, which has
thus been in so large a measure eliminated
from legitimate business methods, be encour
aged' to rcapnear and to delude the inexperi
enced and the unwary? We cannot conceive
it to be our duty to lend euch encourage
ment.
Cincinnati Takes Action.
CINCINNATI. March 26.â Following the
Supreme Court decision against the Inter
state Debenture Bond. Company Judge
Pfleger to-day appointed M. G. Helntz arvl
F. R. Williams receivers of the concern.
The assets on the outside -will not exceed
$175,000 and the liabilities may reach $300 -
O00. possibly more. If, as said, the com
pany is liable for unly Its 4 per cent re
serve the debts will be less than the as
sets. But if the company is liable for. all
the money that has been paid in the debts
will accumulate rapidly. The concern has
1900 policy-holders, scattered all over the
country. *
Later In the day the Superior Court
granted injunctions against the National
Investment Company, the United States
Investment Company and the Germania
Bond and Investment Company from do
ing business in Ohio. These debenture
companies are operated under the same
law as the Interstate Company, which
was ousted at Columbus by the Supreme
Court to-day. The announcement of th<Â»
proceedings In court here to-day created
quite a sensation as there are about 5000
debenture holders In Cincinnati. Notices
were-seiit out early In the day for a mass
meeting' of the; local debenture holders
this evening, at which about 300 Indignant
bondholders were present.' Resolutions
were adopted charging that a conspiracy
of insurance companies was responsible

to consult J. P. Morgan in an effort to

conferences with his . representatives. It
was said to-day that Mr. Mitchell had
not approached any of the operators and
railway officials ' in New York, but has
confined his attention to talking with men
close to Mr. Morgan. .
There is a feeling among the operators
that if Mr. Morgan says there must not
be a Btrike there will not be one. Ralph
M. Kasley, secretary of the National Civic
Federation. Is authority for the statement
that the meeting of the National Civic

Descriptions of the vision by each of

ally and at different places by a Call cor
respondent this morning. They describe
the vision as a representation or picture
of the' dead girl, showing- her head and
ftart cf her body, surrounded by a. halo
or cloucJlike effect. A. simple white gown,
which setmed to lose itself in clouds, was
the clothing; her hands were crossed on
her breast from shoulder to shoulder: her
features were very distinct. On her head
nas a wreath and hajifrtng from one hand
was a rosary. Starting at the corner
away frcm the parlor the apparition
heemed to move slowly along the. wall in
the direction of the parlor, its arms un
folding. Arriving at the corner., of the
room nearest the parlor the flsrire slowly
faded e way. according to all the wit
nesses, leaving a bright cloud light on the
wall for 6ome time. It is estimated that
the vision lasted for from three to five
minutes. Â¦ The entire party stood Fpell

: YONKERF. N. Y.. March 26.â What is
the roost remarkable story of^a vision or
apparition ever known here* is told by
peveri pt reons, who solemnly declare they
raw a miraculous vision of Miss Julia
Murray in the room adjoining that in.
she lay dead.
One girl on seeing- the supernatural ap
pearance dropped to her knees to pray, a
second fainted and a third ran through
the house calling in other persons. Four
came in time to see the full vision, while
others reached the room only in time to
*>ee the portion of the wall where the
vision had been last seen brilliantly and
mysteriously illuminated.
In words they hold sacred these persons
affirm that they saw a spectacle of mag
nificent splendor. As the witnesses are
well known in the cli$\ their story has
caused a tremendous stir. Miss Murray
died on Saturday Â«u her home, 151 Ash
burton avenue, oppositu St. Joseph's Cath
olic Church. Miss Murray was one of
the nu-st popular young women in the
northern section of this city, and several
,i,t her friends stayed over night at the
house. The body "' was in' thÂ« parlor,
Â¦where feme of Miss Murray's friends sat
ihrouph the nijrht, others being scattered
through the house.
Miss Katie Kane of Brooklyn, a cousin
of Miss Murray, at about half-past 4 this
morning t-tarted to go through the bed
room in which.Miss Murray had died. She
guddeniv stopped.
"My Ood." she cried, "there ts Julia."
With this exclamation she dropped to
her kr.ec-b, and covering her face with her
hands commenced praying. Miss Nora
Smith of '.''i Palisade avenue was near by.
She looked where Miss Kane had pointed
and then fainted. Miss Rose Kearns of
St. Joseph avenue ran into the room from
the parlor, looked once and then, hiding
her face in her hands ran out through the
other rooms screaming:.
William Murray, brother "Of "the-tJeatl

too, saw the vision. Misses Rose and

CITY OF MEXICO, March 26.â The air
is full of rumors of great and sweeping
changes in the railroad ' situation and'}
division of railroads of this country Jn two
groups, one controlling the Mexican Na
tional, which will be made standard
gauge, and the other taking over the Mex

Pacific is absorbing the Mexican National
and will controt the Monterey and* Gulf
road and possibly the old Vera Cruz line.
Prominent capitalists h.ave their agents
here, who are in daily' consultation with
the highest Government people. One re
port has it that the Mexican Central and
Santa Fe will consolidate, and another
that the Rock Island will absorb the Cen

in this city tÂ«-day as to the details of the

mits of no nuestion. comes a report that
the proposition has been made and thÂ»

not cannot be ascertained.
It is stated that the proposition is op
posed by former President Perkins of the
Burlington, who has left Burlington.

with his colleagues. Perkins is still a di

success were not bright. . Among the con

State Senators Frank Leavitt and S!g.

fancied that Wakefleld Baker -and Isaac

John Beck Finds His
Relatives.
Family Has Mourned Him as One
Dead Since He Left His San
I Francisco Home Nearly a
Half Century Ago.
SpecieJ Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL. March 26.â After be
lieving all his kin dead and after a lapse
cf more than forty-six years John Beck,
a farmer of Napa and Sacramento coun
ties, was yesterday conducted into {he
presence of his sister, Mrs. J. E. Woot
. ten, and to-morrow brother and sister
will journey to San Juan, San Benito
County, where an 82-year-old mother
will clasp her son to her heart, after al
most a half-century had separated them.
On November 7, 1855, Uttie John Beck
left the home of his mother and step
father in San Francisco and set himself
to the task of building his own for
tune.
"When X left San Francisco," said he
to-day. "I went to Sacramento and ob
tained employment in U" dairy. 1 stayed
at this for a number of years. Then I
went prospecting and met the* usual luck
attending such venturesâ I went 'broke.'
I came back to Sacramento and tried
ranching again. After this I obtained
employment on the railroad then build
ing. In 1S68, I returned to San Francisco
to look. uÂ»Â«-tny folks, but the great
changes there baffled my efforts to find
them, and I gave up the quest in despair.
I am glad lhat they are alive and we
can be together once more. To-morrow
1 shall go "to Â»ee my mother, whom for
many years I have believed to be dead."
After entering the employ of the rail
road company Mr. Beck worked upward
and was for seventeen years a superin
tendent rnder Benjamin Crocker. Some
years ago he returned to farming and
now has considerable property in Napa
and Sacramento counties.
The way ihe reunion was brought
about almost challenges belief. About
four weeks ago Joseph Zuver of Auburn
was dining with Mr. and Mrs. J. E.
Wootten at their home at San Quentln.
In the course of the conversation llr.
Zuver said that a person could tell one's
nationality by his name, whereupon Mrs.
Wootten asked him to tell her national
ity, saying that her maiden name was
Beck. Zuver said that her face had long
reminded him of some person whom he
could not call to mind, but that her men
tion of the name Beck, had quickened
his memory. J>>hn Beck of Sacramento
wae the person he had been \ trying to
recall. He then told Mrs. Wootten that
there was a stronp reeemblance between
her and John Berk. In the conversation
that followed. Mrs. Wootten told the
story of her long-lost brother, and won
dered if the Sacramento Beck could be
he. On Suvcr's return home he met Beck
Â«nd told him the story, with the result
that yesterday brother and sister were
united.
When yonsr Beck returned to San Fran
cisco in 1M>S, his people had moved to
Alameda. I^ater they went to Watson
ville, and from there to San Benito Coun
ty, where th<? aged mother now resides.
Mr. Beck has several half-brothers and
Bisters whom he has never seen, and one
fister. who was a baby when he left
home. It is intended to call the whole
family together at the mother's home
at San Juan. The news will be broken
>rently to the mother, Mrs. Reglna Beut
tier. lÂ«>st the shock may have serious con
sequences.

CUTS THE PRICE OF
PRUNES FOB EXPORT
California Cured Fruit Association
Acts "Without Consulting the
Packers.
SAN JOSE. March 26.â The California
Cured Fruit Association has cut the
prices of prunes for export one-half cent
a pound. This is for the sizes from 40-50" a
to 90-100's, inclusive. The packers' com
pany this afternoon notified the jobbers
of America and Europe of the reduction.
This action of the Cured Fruit Associa
tion was taken without the advice of the
packers. While the latter may not seri
ously oppose the reduction it is said that
in view of the fact that the cut Is made
not . so much to meet competition is to
unload an oversupply the American deal
ers should also have had the benefit of
the reduction.
On the other hand, the association peo
ple eajs that the cut would be of no ma
terial benefit to the American trade; but
is absolutely necessary if California
prunes are to be sold in-Germany. where
the prune of Europe Is selling for less
money than the . California product can
be sold for there on a 2^-cent basis. The
new basisâ 2 centsâ puts the exporter on
an equal footing with the jobber of Eu
ropean prunes. '._ . ... -.. ',

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. March 26.â Minute de
tails of the' terrible tragedy enacted at
Compton ! last night confirm the early
story of the killing of Ward C. Stratton
and Ralph Mulherron and the sensational
suicide of their slayor, Clarence S. Craw
ford,. in the dooryard of Strattqn's home,
as being the deed of an Insane man. Mul
herron died at 4 o'clock this morning. He
was 'the first; person on whom Crawford
attempted , to wreak summary Vengeance
for Â¦ imaginary v wrongs. Mulherron : was
called from a bunknouse and shot down
in cold blood ' by tlio man whdm"~ he be
lieved to.be his friend. :- .
Compton had not recovered from the ex
citement of last night's tragedy when the
Coroner appeared on the scene this morn
ing. LJttle; by little the story was wrung
from witnesses before the Coroner's jurw
until the chapter Â¦ of terrible events wa$
rendered complete. That Stratton .was
killed because Crawford imagined the
rancher Â¦ had -heaped wrongs upon him
there is no, doubt. â¢ Mulherron was killed
because Crawford believed he had circu
lated stories in the neighborhood â¢deroga
tory to Crawford's character' and which
had caused him to lose the friendship of
Mrs. .' Stratton. 'â¢ Thcr*>; is no Â¦ doubt that
Crawford had deliberately, planned to
murder Mr. , and * Mrs. Stratton and theu
end his own career.
Confession of Jealousy.
: The bo.dy of the murderer .." and suicide
was searched by tiie Coroner. Among
other 'articles founi was a passbook is
sued to Crawford by the local lodge of
the Fraternal Aid Association of Comp
ton.=A single sentence that had evidently
been penciled on a page -of this book a
short time prior to the tragedy told the
story of Crawford's awful crime. It was:
"Jealousy is hell." . >
Nineteen cartridges were Â¦ found in a
coat-pocket of thÂ« youth. .
Â¦ After viewing Crav/iord's body members
of the jury were driven to the ranch of
Daniel Hathron, where an inquest was
held over, the body, ot ; Ralph Mulherron,
who was the first victim of Crawford's
wrath. From Hathron's- place the jury
went- to the ranch of Mason Brothers,
where Stratton had Jived for the last six
years. After the body of Ward C. Strat
ton had been viewed the evidence of Mrs.
Stratton was given. She had suffered a
severe shock from the awful tragedy and
was able to leave her bed scarcely long
enough to tell her story.
Told Her of His Love.
"My husband had some trouble swlth
Crawford last August," she said, between
sobs. < "Crawford quit his employ. and a
few days later wanted to be taken back.
When. Mr. Strattqn refused to Rive him
employment longer he threatened to 'get
even 1 "with him.' I do not know that Mr.
Stratton feared him, but I had taken the
precaution to warn my husband against
bim." -
"Did Crawford ever propose to you that
you should leave your husband and elope
with him?" Coroner Holland asked Mrs.
Stratton. , . .;
"Yes, he did." she replied, after some
hesitation. "About three weeks before he
quit my husband's employ he approached
me one day and told me that he could not
live without me. He wanted me to elope
with him and I refined* to- gx>. I repulsed
his attentions, an-1 during the eight
months that he was. here I never gave
him occasion to speak of love to me.".
The jury found that Crawford had mur
dered Stratton and- Mulherron and killed
himself while temporarily insane.

It used to be considered that only urin-
ary, and bladder troubles were to be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all disease*
have ' their beginning In the disorder ot
these most Important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the blood;
that is their work. Â»
Therefore. when your kidneys are weak
or out of order "you can understand how
quickly your entire body Is affected, and
how every organ seems to fail to do its
duty.
If you' are sick or "feel badly" begin
taking the famous new discovery. Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon
as your kidneys are well they, will help
all the other organs to health. A trial

Weak and unhealthy kidneys are re-
sponsible for more sickness and suffering:
than any other disease, and if permitted
to continue fatal results are surq to fol-
low. Kidney trouble Irritates the nerves,
makes you dizzy, .restless, sleepless and
irritable: makes you pass water often
during the day, and obliges you to get
up many. times during the night; cause3
puffy or dsrk circles under the eyes,
rheumatism, gravel, . catarrh of the blad-
der, pain or dull ache in the back, joints
and muscles, makes your head ache and
back ache, causes indigestion, stomach
and liver trouble; you get a sallow, yel-
low complexion; makes you feel as
though you had heart trouble: you may
have plenty of ambition but no strength;
get weak and waste away.

mer's Swamp-Root.- the world-famous
kidney remedy. In' taking Swamp-Root

a glass or bottle and let it Btand twenty-
four hours. If on examination it is milky
or cloudy, if there is a hrick-dust- settling
or if email particles float about in it,
your kidneys are in need of Immediate
attention.
Swamp-Root Is peasant to take and Is
used In the leading hospitals, -recom-
mended Iiy physicians in their private
practice and is taken by doctors them-
selves who have kidney nllm"nt.Â«. becau<*

The following letter was received the other day
from a customer who had ordered one of our $10.00
made-to-order suits:
Gentlemen: â My suit arrived yesterday and I have great
pleasure in stating that I found it entirely satisfactory in every
respect. v
I have had a tolerably extensive experience with tailors,
having in the course of my life had garments cut for m^ by
some^of the best-known firms in New York and Boston, in this
country, as well as in London, Vienna and other capitals abroad.
And I can assure you that 1 have rarely had the experience of
having a suit come home where I- found absolutely nothing
needing correction, as in this case.
I consider your success really f remarkable, especially as
this was the first time.you had worked for me and you had only,
my. own measurements to go by, without even requiring me to.
try on the' garments before they were finished. Not alone the
fit but the finish, linings, etc., leave nothing to be desired.
You may be sure that so long as you continue to fulfill your
promises as well as you have done in this you may
count on me as a regular customer. Mianwhile I will do my
â¢â¢^best to recomm nJ you 'to my friend?.
' Yours very trukv

Judge Sea-Rell. in -an opinion handed

and Diamond streets, is not a nuisance.
For some time cerutn residents of the
Mission have been erideavorinc to. secure
action by the local authorities condemn

applied to the Board ol Supervisors to
take action, but on investigation the board
decided that the reauest of the Mission
residents was unreasonable and that ac

Finally Patrick Rooney. who lives near
the quirrry. and other residents joined as
plafntiffs in an action in which they
sought judsrment declaring the Quarry a.

Deardruff said he planned the robbery
by himself and had taken no one into his
confidence. His first idea was simply to
steal the tray of diamonds. He accom
plished this, he said, during the afternoon
of March 11 and hid the rings in the base
ment. It then occurred to him that he
could not immediately negotiate a sale of
the diamonds, and the scheme to extort
money from Mr. Edwards was conceived.
Deardruff has been employed by the firm
for eighteen months. He will be prose
cuted for grand larceny.
KANSAS CITY. March 26.âTwenty
year-old William Deardruff v a clerk, was
arrested to-day charged with stealing
$3100 worth of diamond rings from, his em
ployers, Edwards & Sloan, wholesale Jew
elers. Later when confronted with the
rings, which had been found hidden in the
basement of the firm's building. Deardruff
broke down and confessed. Deardruff. also
confessed to having sent Mr. Edwards,
the senior member of the flnn. a letter
threatening to kidnap the jeweler's son if
he did not immediately produce $1000 In
gold.
"I admit the .whole thing," said the pris
oner after he had signed a written con

The law which appjies to railroaders In
Mexico was passed many years ago. Mem
bers of the Order of Railway Conductors
here feel that owing to their proximity to
the border they are in a position to do
more to alleviate the conditions among
railway men In Mexico than lodges else
where, and have gone to work with a
will. There are said to be nearly 100
American ' trainmen â¢ in prison - in various
parts of Mexico. Most of them have been
held- for months without -trial. Â¦'Â¦ - >. â¢Â¦
EL PASO, Tex.. March 26.â Innumerable
arrests and indefinite Imprisonments with

Mexico have at last awakened members
of the Order of Railway Conductors along
the border to a realization of the fact that
It is high time to put an end to what they
characterize us an Intolerable, condition
of affairs. To-day a second Mexican Cen
tral train crew was arrested at
Juarez because their train killed a Mexi
can who ran upon the track- directly in
front of a rapidly moving locomotive. The
men were locked up to await trial, which
may take place at some time in. the future
that suits the, convenience of court offi
cials. . *
Less than a week ago another Mexican
Central crew, .whose train ran over and
killed a Mexican tramp who tried to board
it, were thrown into prison aod held ln

This crew consisted of Engineer Kelly and
his two American brakemen. â¢ Kelly is
prominently connected. His father was

hold of Kelly's case, and after thoroughly
investigating \ and convincing themselves
of the innocence of Kelly, and his associ

decided to take the matter up with' the

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART,
"I am.*' said the witness emphatically.
The witness related how Swenson &
Sons had refused to cafh the check, and
said that he had learned of Rice'B death
at their office. Subsequently witness told
how he had -been given a check for $135,-
OCW on the Fifth Avenue Trust Company,
which he- had taken to the office of that
company to have certified. He succeeded
in having the check certified. Witness
admitted he had not mentioned at the
bank that Rice was d"ead. The two checks
were placed in evidence. Patrick, the wit
ness s=a!d. upon his seturn from the office
of Swenson & Sons had informed him that
Rice was dead, "had passed away early
on Sunday afternoon."
"So you are positive Patrick sent you to
cafh Mr. Rice's check for $25,000 and did
not tell you he was dead? Are you sure
of that?" asked Mr. Osborne. "
Sir. Osborae then examined Short at
length concerning his last visit to the
house of Mr. Rice on the 21st of Septem
ber, two days before the death of Mr.
Riee. Mr. Osborne then nns<=pd over thÂ«
incidents following immediately upon th*
death of Mr. Rice. Witness related how
he had been sent to Swenson &. Sons to
cash a check for $25,000. He did not know
that Mr. Rice was dead at the time, Pat
rick had not told him.
"Yes; he asked me not to say anything
about it until after he was dead and
gone."
The witness then said Rice handed the
will to Myers, Patrick's law partner, who
glanced it over and returned it, and Mr.
Rice sat at his desk and signed all the
papers. Myers and Short then signed as
witnesses. Osborne handed him the will,
which he identified. The witness also iden
tified three other papers as documents
which he had executed as Commissioner
on June 30. When the will had been exe
cuted it was handed to Myers to take to
Patrick's office.
"Did Mr. Rice Fay anything to you re
garding the will?" asked Mr. Osborne.
"Did > ou see Mr. Rice sign those papers,
including the will?" Short said he did.
He Â»iaid he signed the three documents
and Rice then said, "Gentlemen, while
you are here 1 want you to witness an
other paper, my last will and testament."
"On June 30 you said you had acknowl
edged three papers for Mr. Rice?" asked
Assistant District Attorney Osborne.
"Yes." He also said he had witnessed
another, a will.
At the afternoon session Short resumed
the stand and said he had failed to nnd
the book in which he put down the dates
when he had visited Rice's house.
The witness identified a paper that he
had acknowledged as Commissioner of
l>eeds. The paper was offered in evidence
by the prosecution, who expected to prove
that it was a forgery. Counsel for the de
fense objected on the ground of irrele
vancy, and the paper was excluded tem
porarily. The prosecution brought out
from the. witness that he had been at Mr.
Rice's house on business on May 26, June
IS), Septen.ber 7, September 19 and Septem
ber 21. two days ber'ore Rice's death. Short
paid he might have been at the house of
Mr. IUce on other occasions. He had wit
nessed several assignments of property to
be filed in the State of New York.
The i:rst witness was l>avid L.. Short, a
publisher of Brooklyn. Short said he be
came a Commissioner of Deeds of Texas
at the suggestion of Patrick. Jones was
introduced to him, he said, as the private
eecrt-tary of a wealthy Texas client of
1'atricK.s. The witness admitted that on
several occasions he had left his official
eeal at the apartments of Mr. Kice alter
transacting business there. Witness said
he had never acted as a commissioner for
any one except Mr. Kice, and that was at
the request of Patrick. Witness had

. C0LUMBU3. Ohio. March 26.â Seven
men robbed the Somerset bank at about
1:30 o'clock this morning. Only about $5000
in cash was taken, the robbers In their
hurry overlooking $3000 in gold coin and
$30,000 in bond3 and time securities. Three
men worked in the bank and four were
stationed as sentinels near by.
At the first explosion Mr. Hayes, mrtng
opposite the bank, came out and was met
by a sentinel, who told him to get back
into the house If he did not want hl3 head
blown off.' Mr. rLovett; another citizen,
took four shots at the robbers, which
were "returned, and a fusillade waj kept
up for some time.'
* Armed citizens pursued the robbers
some distance north, and the polico here
notified ail nearby towns and instructed
them to keep a sharp lookout fur the
bandits. The Sheriff cf Perry County, at
New Lexington, was notified ard drove to
Somerset \Hth bis bloodhounds. The
dogs readily tuok up the trail, which let!
from a blacksmith shop where the tools
were obtained, thence to a livery stablo
and to the bank. Two rigs had. been
stolen, and after the robbers had driven
away the officers waited for daylight to
follow the wheel tracks. A hard fight is
expected If tha band is captured.
After the robbers had completed their
work the men were lined up In single file
and the leader gave the order, "All ready ;
forward, march."
The robbers were as cool as soldiers on
dress parade.
The stolen horses were recovered about
4 o'clock three and a half milea from
â¢town.* where they had been abandoned.
The robbers were then making their way
toward Hadley Junction.
The bank at Somerset Is located In a
brick building, and the force of the explo
sions blew out the entire front and scat
tered debris all over the street. The bank
Is a State institution. Samuel Ream is
the president and A. B. Ream the cashier.
The loss is fully covered by insurance and

John J. English and 123 others ta recover
$500 damages each, a total of $62,000, Tor

The complaint alleges that "on Septem

contract, with W. R; Grace & Co. to take
care of a shipment of horses on the trans

II i man, cigar stand v layer of odd3,
race-groins 1 woman and "regular"
possessed the' secret that Wardman would
win the fifth event yesterday at Tanforan.
It was a seven-furlong selection and
eleven as good and healthy looking maid
ens 'as were ever omitted from the hack
and cab service galloped toahe post. The
bookies.laid 6 to 5 until the drop curtain
fell, because they thought it a case of the
doer that. howled loudest getting away
with the bone. No doubt some few of
them are still paying off, for with Dom
inick on his back Wardman won pricking
his ears by five open lengths before Illu
sion and Canejo. The winner, for a lowly
ie aid en with no pretensions to class, had
shown well in workouts and the employes
of the bottling works had distributed the
information gratuitously in, advance,
which precluded any sort of a fair price
being obtained.
In fact.. the entire card was one that
catered to the cheaper class of racing ma
terial, possibly the hardest the talent has
been-asked to grapple with this season.
Upsets were looked for, and they: came.
Of the favorites besides Wardman, Alarys
Garter was the only one to abscond with
a purse. Class seems to cut no figure
anyhow, for the attendance was again
large.
By his own admfssion, according to the
Judges, Mounce and his mount Hipponax,
after finishing first for the final seven
furlong event, also for maidens, were dis
qualified and the race given to Letlger.
To many it looked as if Hipponax was
best, and that O'Connor, in desperation,
had worked the shop-worn dodge of pull
ing up as if dreadfully fouled when he
saw all was lost. Both Hipponax and
Letig-er, the latter a 13 to 5 favorite, came
from far back, the former winning by a
couple of lengths. When opposite the pad
dock Hipponax bore in and O'Connor ap
parently had to ease up with Letlger.
Called into the stand, Mounce admitted
that his horse -bumped Letlger not only
opposite the paddock but again farther
down the stretch. On this admission the
purse was awarded to Letiger. Even at
that there is ground for disputing the
fairness of the disqualification. O'Connor
has ridden several years and knows -what
time it is. Further, when on a beaten
horse and the slightest provocation arises
he w}U pull his horse* up and cast a de
spairing look at the stand. The trick is
dusty and shop worn and was tried with
some success long before uÂ«e> old-fash
ioned photograph of mother was found in
the attic and the house where the author
was born had been replaced by a seven
teen-story skyscraper, in this particular
instance, however, the ruling was no
doubt a just one.
A big bunch of twelve started in the in
troductory five and a half furlong scram
ble, for which Alarys Garter, with O'Con
nor in the saddle, ruled favorite. The air
was full of flying tips on Montanus, Rl
cardo, Zurich and Dunboy. O'Connor was
fortunate in getting away first with the
favorite, winning from the jump. â¢ Midian,
on the rail, got the place from the fast
closing- Montanus. .
This was followed by a six and a half
furlong sprint, for which Pat Dunne's
three-year-old Benson Caldwell came in
for steady support "at odds Â»of 2 to 1.
O'Connor had the leg up, and in an en
deavor to get a flying start ran into *a
pocket as the barrier was released. Eonic.
ridden by J. Ransch, went out in the lead
and was never caught, beating Bernota
and Sublime home in ragtime. Introductor
ran under wraps to the etretch, when he'
fell back.
Of the eight "leppers" that started in
the mile and three-quarter hurdle num
ber only three finished. Rio Chlco, ridden
by Lloyd and accorded â¢ extensive wise
support, held May Boy safe at "the close,
scoring with comparative ease. Granger,
a 20 to 1 shot, ran third. J O C, the fa
vorite, refused to jump on the back
stretch while leading the second division
Â¦up to the firing line. Dlomed turned a
flip-flap on the backstretch also, and his
rider, O. Brown, had his collarbone frac
tured.
Through a piece of " misjudgment
Jlonnw on the. favorite,-Nullah, threw
away the fourth event. ..Getting away
first, he thought the clip too fast, allow
ing Jennie, a* speedy mare from Harry
Sjover's string, to pick up the running.
In the run to the wire the latter did not
back up as Mounce had - figured arid the
favorite arrived late by a short head. The
winner was 6 and 7 to*l in the ring. Ed
Lanigan's Genua ran a fair third.

OF EJECTMENTS
Decision for Railroad in
Hyatt Case Causes
Uneasiness.
The decision of the Supreme Court In
the case of the Southern Pacific Company
egainst J. W. Hyatt, handed down on the
16th instant and In favor of the railroad.
Trill result in many ejectment suits by the
corporation and consequent uneasiness en
the part of hundreds of owners of land
Â¦whose titles are affected by the ruling.
Chief Counsel Herrin of the railroad com
pany is preparing to at once oust those
who are holding lands which. In view of
the decision, they are not legally en
titled to.
The Southern Pacific Company brought
suit to eject Hyatt, who for more than
twenty years had maintained a hotel in
a building distant about 1C0 feet from the
Central Pacific Railroad. The Congres
sional act under which the railroad was
built grants a right-of-way for 200 feet In
width on each side cf the cenler of the
railroad, and the Southern Pacific Com
pany, contending tliat the company's
granting act created a public highway 4iX)
lcet wide within which no person may
lawfully settle or acquire prescriptive
right, brought suit to eject Hyatt. The
Superior Court of Flacer County herd
rpainst the Southern Pacific Company on
the grounds that Hyatt, by adverse occu
pancy and the payment of taxes for more
than five years, had acquired prescriptive
title to the lands in Â£uit.
As there are mary persons occupying
lands within "00 fr-et of this railroad claim
ing title as did IIyrÂ»' w t. by adverse occu
pancy, this decision 1.-. of general interest.
The decision starts out by saying:
ThÂ» cuMitiors involved In this appeal are:
<1) Whether a railroad rlsht of way if such
a fiublic uis* as to prevent the running of the
Etatute of limitation*, cr the acquisition of an
adverse titl* thereto by r'reKciiDtlcn ? (2) In
cue of intrusion ui>on euch ricnt of v.ay, Is
ejectment the inoper remedy?
The decision, after Baying that "the
questions involved are not new, butHhave
been passed upon frequently in the courts
of the I'nited Staves, of this State and
cf other States." and quoting from such
decisions, holds that the Southern Pacific
right-of-way for 200 feet on each side of
Its read is such a p"klic use as prevents
the statute of limitatipns from running In
favor of. an adverse occupant of ground
within those limits, and that ejectment Is
the proper remedy to dispossess such oc
cupants.

p^l^HE Panama Railroad Company's
I chartered steamship Roandke ar
! rived from Panama and way ports
1L yesterday after a very rough pas
sage. During a four days' gale in
the gulf of Tehuantepec the vessel was
swept by heavy seas and much damage*
was done. The pilot-house was stove In,
ventilators carried away, storm ports
smashed In and the cabins flooded. Three
seas broke aboard, one after the other, on
the mornins of the 17th, and the passen
gers ftared that the vessel would never
clear herself of the body of water that
was hurled on her decks.
In his report the captain says:
Left Panama on March 12 with a fair wind
and smooth pea. Before many hours had
passed we ran into a heavy NNWi gale, dur
ing which the vessel labored heavily. For four
daya the storm rased and some seas that broke
over us started the starboard railing-, carried
away the JackstaiT and ventilators, stove in
the pilot-house and tore four of the storm
ports off their hlngca. At 1 a. m. on the 17th
Ir.st. ' v/c had to heave the ship S to and for
elaven hours i we hail to grin and bear it.
From that time until port was Â¦ reached we
had nothing but heavy northwest gales and
head seas to contend with.
The Roanoke will be repaired and will
make one more trip to Panama for the
railroad company, after which she will go
into the Nome trade.

Gentlemen â I had been afflicted for ten

flisease, but after having the physicians
examine me I learned that I was almost
dead with indigestion. They told me that
they could give me medicine that would
relieve me, but there was no permanent
cure. Then I began using Paine's celery
compound, which gave me immediate re-
lief, and now I am well and enjoying good
health. I can recommend Paine's celery
compound to be the best remedy for all
ailments I ever used. and. furthermore,
I "tell my people if they will use the com-
pound freely they will have no doctor's
bills to pay.

Under such circumstances it is saddening to learn
that the big house in New York is to serve alternately
as a grand opera-house and as a cheap variety show.
The New .York Times says: "Unless plans miscarry
a complete change in the policy of the Metropolitan
Opera-house will occur shortly after the close of the
operatic season on April 29, when grand opera per
formances given by the finest artists in the world will
give place to vaudeville at prices ranging from 15 to
50 cents. This arrangement, it is understood, is to be
concluded shortly, and a contract entered into be
tween the Maurice Grau Opera Company, the. lessees
of the house, and the Lederer Amusement Compan3\
of which George W. Lederer is the managing director.
The latter company is to have a permanent tenancy
of the opera-house for both winter and summer, with
the exception of an interval of ten weeks for grand
opera, which will begin in all probability about Christ
mas week. The remainder M the year .will be given
over to the biggest kind of ah indoor entertainment,
which 'will embrace circus, variety, minstrelsy, ballet,
burlesque and opera."
1 â ;OR a long time the Metropolitan Opera-house
I in New York has been the boast of the Ameri
. can people. It has been an evidence that under
republican institutions it is possible to do as much
for the luxury of art as any imperial power can do.
While the opera-house itself has not rivaled in mag
nificence nor in beauty of architecture some of the
grand opera buildings of Europe, it has nevertheless
served to gather to this country troupes of singers
superior to, any troupe that ever delighted the Old
World. No combinations of genius have ever been
formed for rendering opera in any other country equal
to those which have been drawn together primarily
for the Metropolitan, and which from that center have
gone up and down the length and breadth of the land
as far as San Francisco, delighting audiences, giving
society a chance to show itself under its fairest aspect;
and materially adding to the musical culture of the
people. *

Eastern people insist on removing the Californian

Now, what is hacking Kansas bars compared to the

not odious men, either. They all belong to Carrie's
gentle sex. Let her go"and argue with that smoke
seasoned old Connecticut dame and that hardened
whiffer from Missouri, and see what she can do with
them. After she has c.rried the Fort Nicotine, gar
risoned by a female army,, she may return to the

ing short of her hatchet will break those ladies of the
tobacco habit. . How she is to apply her favorite
weapon is for her to choose, whether the edge, or
flatwise as a spanker. We will not presume to advise
such an expert.
A sufferer from tobacco who properly calls himself
a martyr writes from New York a Macedonian cry
in a big round hand, and Mrs. Nation should take the
next train to the' scene of his torment. He says: "My
paternal grandmother, who is a native of Connecticut
and lives with. me, has always smoked a pipe. My
mother, who is a Missourian and lives with me, also
smokes a pipe. My wife is a Russian and smokes
cigarettes, as does my sister-in-law, who is a Cuban.
My daughter is. an artist and als.o smokes. I hate
tobacco in any form, and if grandma and ma and
my wife, sister-in-law and daughter: can. be made to
s^op smoking I shall be a happy man."
GARRIE NATION'S hatchet is growing rusty
while that knightess errant' is admonishing
against the sinful round dance and the soothing
cigar. She goes forth upon the street to halt every
gentleman with pipe or cigar stuck in his face and
orders him, in the name of the Great Jehovah and
Carrie Nation, to quit, swear off and cease right there
fiorri sinning with nicotine. So far hot a conversion
is recorded. ,No one has quit. The fragrant Havana
and the unfragrant nauseadora Perfecto still blaze and
their smoke ascends to heaven; even as did the smoke

Clearly the Czar has many troubles, and those in
China are the least of them. There is now a seem
ir^gly clofe alliance in Russia between the university
students, the socialist labor party ;md the Pan-rSlav
conspirator?. Xor can there be any question that the
nihilists and anarchists will lend their help to th-s
others in disturbing the Government. It is to be
noted, moreover, that a recent report of the arrests
following the first outbreak of students at St. Peters
burg announced that among the arrested persons wers
upward of 350 women students. Thus there appears
to be something like a desire for a general uprising,
including women as well as men. No one believes
that the Czar sleeps in a steel safe, but all tho same
the man who invented the story had' a fairly good
idea of what he would do if he were Czar.
In making that declaration we fear Count Cassini
was more mindful of his duty to his Czar than of
his duty to speak the truth when talking to the Ameri
can people.. The Cossacks of the Imperial Guard are
habitually equipped, it appears, with whips, and as
such weapons cannot be of use in war, it is evident
they are intended solely for flogging the folks at
home in piping times of peace. Such being the case,
it is certainly quite within the scope of probability
that in using whips upon a crowd of students and
workingmen who were sufficiently numerous to feel
something of strength there should have been an out
break that could not be put down by the lash and the
Cossacks were forced to use their swords. There may
have been and doubtless was something of exaggera
tion in the reports, but the world cannot be convinced
by a simple statement from a diplomat living in Wash
ington that there was, in fact, no more truth in the
report of the slaughter than there was in the yarn
of the steel-lined bedroom.
Cassini, however, did not content himself with de
nying the existence of a steel armored room in the
palace in which the Czar is kept like a good gold brick
in a safe deposit vault. He declared a conviction of
the falseness of the reports concerning the affray a:
St. Petersburg between the students and the working
men on the one side and the Cossacks of the guard
on the other. He scoffed at the idea that any one
had been killed, and said: "This report is probably
based upon the fact that the Cossacks in dispersing
a crowd used their whips, with which they are
equipped. It is utter nonsense to say a hundred men
were killed." * .: " ;
The St. Petersburg correspondent who sent that
story to Berlin, or the Berlin newspaper man who
composed it in a beer cellar at home and dated it
from the Russian capital, is a faker of talent. His
story was worthy of a romance. It will be remem
bered he said that the walls of the Czar's study and
bedroom are covered with steel armor, that the doors
are closed by a cunning mechanism so arranged that
no one can open them while the Czar is within the
room, and finally th-u he has five desks in his study
which he uses ore after another, so that no one can
foresee at which desk he will be working at any given
time. That was a story that lacked but one element
to make it worthy of the yellow fakers of this country.
It would have been complete had the writer described
himself as interviewing the Czar in the steel cage and
getting his opinions on the situation in Manchuria
and King Edv.ard's recer.t order that all persons who
call upon him must wear court dress.
COUNT CASSINI, Russian Embassador at
Washington, I12S departed from the serene
heights of diplomacy long enough to take an in
terest in the news of the day and to inform the Ameri
can public that there is no truth in the recent dis
patch from Berlin to the effect that the Czar is com
j-elied to take extraoidinary precautions to assure
himself from assassination. In making this refuta
tion t\ve Count has spoiled a good story which no one
believed, and consequently one that contributed much
to the amusement of the public without doing any

Such being the sentiment in Great Britain it is clear
that if Japan wishes to keep Russia out of Manchuria
she must be prepared to act without allies. Indeed
the Japanese Government will have cause to be thank
ful if it be left free to play a lone hand, for the chances
are that Germany at least will back Russia's scheme
in the expectation of getting something of profit out
of it for herself.
More significant still is the recent declaration of the
London Spectator that Russia will have Manchuria
and cannot be driven out. It went on to say: "If
Europe likes to try the awful experiment of governing
China, let it. Our business is to trade with it, and to
secure that right of trading the sooner we disappear
from Peking and all North China the better. All the
shillyshallying now going on only increases the
chances of some event, or some combination, that will
plunge us .more deeply into the Chinese swamp or
compel us to threaten war with powers who in this
matter are doing us no substantial harm. Imagine our
people, already' overburdened, fighting to prevent
somebody else from getting Mongolia or Shantung!
We might almost as welt fight for trading privileges
in the moon."
Recently in the Commons when the Ministers were
asked whether Russia was acting alone in China and
what the British and other Governments were pre
pared to do to prevent such action, Lord Cranborne
answered that the proposed agreement between Rus
sia and China is still under discussion and that he is
unable to make any positive statement concerning the
matter.
Whether or no that statement rightly express the
intentions of the Japanese Government no one not
in the confidence of that Government can say, but it
is certainly accurate zo far as it relates to the other
powers. Should the Russians compel the Chinese to
cede Manchuria and should they in the face of all the
allied armies now in the Orient proceed to take pos
session of it, there would go forth from "the United
States, from Germany, from France and even from
Great Britain nothing more than a protest. It would
be a bluff which the Russian bear would be very will
ing to meet by showing his hand, being well assure!
that the United States has no intention to go to war
for the preservation of China, and that the other
powers would just as soon compound the Russian
grab by making a grab of their own.
DISPATCHES nom -London quote the First
Secretary of the Japanese legation in that city
as saying of the Russian aggressions in Man
churia: "Assuming that China signs the treaties, I
suppose Great Britain, Germany and the United
States will protest to Russia. But- that is about as
far as they will go and about as much as they will
get. With Japan it is a matter of fighting. The ques
tion is whether we are to fight Russia now or to fight
her later on. She has no right to' Manchuria, and if
she secures Manchuria she willbe.on. the way to se
curing Korea, Our Government, I believe, is consid
ering the crisis. Its eyes are wide open and it will
not be driven to precipitate action by the jingoists of
Japan, who are openly clamoring for immediate war.
Yet if they see that war is unavoidable they will not

and foods for Â¦- their children they must
create the demand : for them. â¢ The Con

lic to a sense of its responsibilities. It
has pointed out the degrading conditions
in several lines: of Industry, notably the
g-arment-maklng Industry, and has shown
that consumers are - partially responsible
for these conditions and can remedy
them' If they combine and make an ear

ten years .ago In New York by a email

' Â¦ Tho Woman's Health ; Protective Asso

in different cities, began life in New York
under difliculties. Its first- effort was di
rected against the old abominable slaugh
ter, housesâ filthy : wooden structures,
where : the slaughtering was -: carried ; on
with- open doors in the presence of spec
tators,; who were usually the children of
the neighborhood. There .were no decent
quarters : for the cattle. before they were
slaughtered : Â¦â¢ they were carried into
stifling and .fetid cellars, where they
could be . seen clambering Â¦ over 'Â¦ one ,Â¦ an
other in vain attempts, to get a whiff 6f
fresh air.; The result Â¦ of the women's
efforts was the substitution eventually of
sp'.endld * modern ,' abattoirs. This Â¦society
has - successfully protested â¢ against - the
maintenance of, stationary scows at docks

In the larger cities in the East the
clubs are usually formed for one definite
purpose; they do not combine the various
departments that are to be found in those
organized in the smaller towns or in the
larger cities of the West. In New York
a large number of women's leagues or as
sociations ' have been organized Â¦ not for
general culture but for a specific object.
The successful accomplishment of the ob
ject in view has led to the formation of
similar organizations in other cities, until
to-day there Is a great â¢ network of these
associations spread all over the country.
Sometimes they become affiliated and
grow into national movements. Among
these . may be named the National Cdn
press of Mothers' Clubs., the National
Consumers' League, the National House
hold Economic Association, the National
Women's Suffrage Association, the Na
tional Women's Temperance Union, the
National Council of Jewish Women and
the National League of Women Workers.
Clubs Having a Specific Object.
The so-called department club, which
Jennte June calls a "club of clubs J' has
grown greatly In Importance. Among the
best known of these Is the Chicago
Woman's Club. In that club there are
six departmentsâ reform, home, educa
tion, philanthropy, art and literature,
philosophy and science. In each depart
ment work Is. carried on along very broad
lines. For Instance, included In the de
partment of education are the visits paid
to public schools, decorations for school
rooms and of special methods in pedagogy,
establishment of vacation schools and
play grounds. The members choose
whichever department they prefer for
work; each department has its own stand
ing committees and its own programme.
Several auxiliary societies have been
formed as an outcome of the work done
by the woman's club. Among these may
be mentioned the Protective Agency for
Women and Children, the School Chil
dren's Aid Society, the Chicago Public
School Art Society, the Chicago Political
Equality League and the Woman's Model
Lodging House Association. The club has
nearly . 850 members enrolled. These
women, if isolated, could do little individ
ually to arouse the public conscience on.

tne unsanitary and disgusting habit of
expectorating in cars and on the floors
of public buildings.
For Better City Government.
Taking the New fork organizations
more especially, though only as examples
of the many similar ones throughout 'no
country, a brief sketch of their origin
may be given. The Woman's Municipal
League of New York, Mrs. I. N. Pheliw
Stokes . president, was organized on the
suggestion of the Rev. Dr. Charles H.
Parkhurst. Its object was to assist In
bringing into power a reform administra
tion at the time of the mayoralty cam
paign of 1S95. The league raised money
among tha> women of the city, held parlor
meetings and meetings in small halls in
the downtown districts, where the benefits
of good , city, go vernmeni. were explained.
After the election the league disbanded;
but was reorganized In 1SD7. During the*
mayoralty campaigned that year it raise!
19000 entirely from women to aid the Citi
zens' Union movement. It arranged two
large and successful mass-meetings that
were held in Cooper Union for men and
women and held manv smaller meetings
for the purpose of keeping before the peo
ple the great Issues at stake. After the
campaign was over the executive commit
tee decided to continue the work for good
municipal government und during the laÂ«t
three years It has kept two lecturers reg
ularly employed In lecturing upon the city
departments, civil service reform and the
city charter. The object of the league Is
to "secure active support for such move
ments and candidates as may give prom
ise of tho best government for the city,
without regard to party lines."
Study of Municipal Needs.
Among other societies that have co
operated with the Municipal
League and that may be considered under
the category of civic, political or patriotic
leagues, I may mention the woman's aux
iliary of the Civil Service Reform Asso
ciation, Mrs. W. H. Schleffelin, president,
which has collected from women about
$1200 a year during the five years that it
has been organized. It offers this year
to members of women's clubs two prizes
of $100 and $50 â¢ respectively for the best
essays on the subject of civil service re
form- The League for Political Educa
tion. Mrs. Henry M. Sanders, president,
strives "to facilitate the study of social
and political science" by forming classes
In economics, civics and parliamentary
law and by providing lectures by eminent
authorities upon political and social sub
jects. It has a reference library for the
benefit of lta members, and it conducts in
vestigations in the various Assembly dis
tricts with the view of studying the moral
and social forces of the city. It pleads for
the study of the city charter, the tene
ment-house laws, the school system, tax
ation and raising of revenue, and the
methods of .the municipal courts. It ad
vises a closer knowledge of the work of
the public departments, of the police,
charities, education, fire and street clean-
Ing service In one's own election district.
Teaching the City's History.
Women in Politics.
While this league is occupied in endeav
oring to instruct adults and Interest them
In political reform the City History Club.
Mrs. Robert Abbe, president, is co-operat
ing by inculcating in the breasts of the
little ones a love for their city, a knowl
edge of its past, an appreciation of its
present needs and an earnest desire to
help it to maintain lofty ideals in the fu
ture. The club alms "to awaken civic
patriotism by the study of city history
and tradition." It aspires to make good,
noble citizens, who will take an interest
in civic affairs, who will consider it their
privilege to assume some of the burdens
and responsibilities of civic life. The club
started its work with seven classes under
the charge of one experienced teacher,
and it has developed so rapidly that at
present there are 108 classes, in which
nearly 2000 children have been enrolled.
Traveling libraries have helped th,e club
with its work; about forty of these libra
ries of books upon the history and govern
ment of the city, volumes of biography
and historical tiction, have been loaned to
classes. Excursions to places of interest
are made by the club in order to visit the
scenes where important events have oc
curred.
One of the best known of the civic clubs
organized by women is the Philadelphia
Civic Club. Its aim is outlined by its
pledge to promote "by education and ac
tive co-operation a higher public spirit
and a better social order." The club has
four standing committees â municipal gov
ernment, education, social science and art.
As women the members have felt pecu
liarly fitted to do municipal house-clean
ing. Through the social science depart
ment they looked into conditions of
schoolhouscs, the proper disposal of
household refuse and. the care of cellars; !
they sought the co-operation of public of
ficials and private householders, and en
deavored to raise a higher standard In
the community. Through the art depart
ment the club instituted a system of Joan
collections and of pictures for schools. It
decorated the schoolrooms with appro
priate photographs and casts. The club
was Invited to co-operate with the Anti-
Spoils League, but the women declined,
because as citizens they bad no political
status. The National Civil Service Re
form Association invited the club to send
delegates to Its convention, but the club
maintained that as its members were dis
franchised citizens it could not do so with
dignity.
The women of the West End Woman's
Republican Association of New York have
taken an entirely different attitude; al
though given no recognition by the Re
publican party, they have united for the
purpose of maintaining and strengthening
the principles of that party. The first year
that the club was organized It devoted It
self to the study of Fiske's "Civil Gov
ernment," Bryce's "American Common
wealth," Gunton's "Wealth and Progress"
and other standard works. 1 The club con
ducted an active campaign in favor of the
gold standard and protection in 1S96. The
members visited the tenement houses In
the Tammany districts, discussed the
Questions at issue with about 15.000 women
and 2000 men. and distributed ov<>r 200 000
pamphlets published in many, languages

Is it not claar that these and the many
siâ¢ 11 ", organizations have ***** a means
; SÂ«tiff KiV^i e w ? men out Â°f the narrow
paths that lay between high walls of
prejudice and ignorance into the open
fields where_they can have an extended
horizon? The woman's club movement,
originating with Sorosis. the seed sowe
has become an .effectual medium for the
propagation of ideas and principles that
affect the welfare of humanity. There
may be some women .who, like Selma in
"Unleavened Bread." use the clubs for
selfish purposes of advancement, but, aa
Herbert Spencer well says, "Societies, lu
their actions and structures, are deter
mined by the mental character of their
units.*' The club that Is made up of
weak characters cannot develop strength
as a club, and it is- unfortunately true
that many weak and foolish women's
clubs exist. But' the work that has been
done by other^>rganlzations \ gives ample
proof that there Is" a living atrengui
somewhere behind the movement.
The club which .will be developed by the
twentieth century in Its full strength win
be composed, let us hope, of both men
and -women. There Is no reason why the
two sexes should . not work side by side
for -.mental development, mutual â¢ recrea
tion and mutual service. The New % Eng

and best known of such organizations

One by one* the glories depart from the stage. Some
of thebest of our actresses and of our singers have
left the opera and the drama for the higher salaries
of the vaudeville. Commercialism rules the stage as
well as "the camp, the court, the grove." Perhaps

will take to the variety route, and it w'U be left after
all to the prize-fighters to uphold the last tradition?

there is something to regret in the fact that the most

to the uses and abuses of vaudeville.
PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
THERE has just been taken an accurate census
of India. It gives a total population of 294,000,
000, an increase, for the decade, of 7,000,000.
But as for the first time it includes the population. of
Baluchistan, Shanstaks, the Chin Hills and Sikkim
territory, the actual net Increase is only 1.4 per cent^
showing that the population is practically stationary.
This census and the conditions which it reveals brings
to -the front again the question of the resources and
the value of tropical countries. It confirms the con
clusions of economists who have always placed the
wealth of, the world in the temperate zone and its
poverty in the tropics.
There is a school of philanthropic economists who
have sought to make the world believe that the pov
erty of the tropics is due to avoidable causes, and that
all that is necessary to its banishment is the introduc
tion of Christianity and what are called modern
methods, meaning thereby the processes of art and
science that have developed under temperate zone
conditions. We regard this view as erroneous and
wholly unscientific.
The development of the temperate zone and the
transmutation of its natural resources into wealth by
human labor has been entirely the outcome of physi
cal conditions, which man did not make and cannot
change.'-- '-*;â¢
No wealth is acquired anywhere except by the exer
tion of human energy. In the tropics natural condi
tions are adverse to human energy, and there is nonÂ».
Life multiplies there until it overtakes the food sup
ply which nature produces spontaneously or yields
grudgingly to small exertion; then famine and its
partner, pestilence, stop the increase and- reduce the
population until it is below the food supply again.
This process has been repeated over and over again
in India for uncounted ages.
It is quite remarkable how little of what are re
garded in the temperate zone as the necessaries of life
is produced in the tropics. None of our great cereals
except rice may be found there. We wonder that the
Indians are vegetarians and that tropical people are
not meat-caters. But the reason behind it all is that
as the climate does not require a meat diet the stan
dard meat foods of the world are not produced in the
equatorial belt. In tropical Central America the prin
cipal meat used is the iguana lizard and the armadillo,
two reptilian animals, znd the monkey. Beef and pork
and mutton as we produce them are impossible there.
The temperate zone gets out of the tropics hardly
any of the necessaries of temperate zone life that can
r.ot be produced elsewhere. If not a stalk of cane
grew in the tropics California alone could supply
every ounce of sugar consumed in this country. If
not a stalk of tobacco grew in Cuba or the Philip
pines, we could produce our own tobacco. The same
is true of rice, which can be grown in unlimited quan
tities in the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, the low
lands of Louisiana and of Eastern Texas.
This leaves but a few dye woods and spices, many
of them unknown to our ancestors, who never felt
the deprivation.
It is true that England gets some revenue from In
dia and her merchant class have enriched themselves
on the spoil of that poverty-smitten people, but the
methods by which th%e results are accomplished are
less creditable than the. enlightened use to which they
are put. *' . ' 1" '
The same may be said 'of Dutch rule in Java and
Sumatra, and was eminently true of the whole colonial
career of Spain. The fancy of theorists in the tem
perate zone is inflamed to enthusiasm over the bright
plumage, the serpentine vines, the brilliant flowers of
the tropical landscape. â¢
But cold and sober-minded judgment tells a differ
ent story- To the temperate zone races and physical
constitution the tropics are noxious. The land, the
water and the air teem with poison for the northern
races. There is no such thing as acclimatization pos
sible. The northern constitution, which withstands all
the rigors of its native climate, and thrives upon alter
nating extremes of heat and cold, wilts, surrenders
and wears away in the tropics.
The physical beauties over which the sentimental
rave to the philosopher and the naturalist are the
gauds of the siren, displayed to woo men to death.
Every nation in the temperate zone, from ancient
times until now, has had* its turn with this tropical
problem and has come under the spell of the siren,
only to drag itself back to its frost and climatic rigors,
where the energies of man are vitalized by nature.

Lennon came back with a sharp reply.
"Yes, I have heard It." he said, "but it
was quoted by the District Attorney, and
that is why I doubted it."
Judge Melvin stopped the squabble by
saying: "If there is any more bickering
between counsel I shall take steps to stop
it- I want counsel to address their re
marks to the court, and I shall see that
they do so after this." The rebuke had
the effect of keeping peace for the rest of
the morning session. Cathcart would not
state If the "Sullivan" warrant was in
the handwriting of McGlade, though he
believed one word looked like it.
Auditor Broderick testified as to the
modus operand! of handling salary war
rants In the municipal government In
1S98, and was still testifying when the
noon lecess was called.
When the afternoon session was called
Auditor Broderick was cross-examined by
the defense, but nothing material was
elicited.
C. S. Derham, deputy superintendent of
streets in 1897-93, testified that he did not
sign his name on the "John Sullivan" sal
ary warrant and did not authorize any
one to do so. ' ; ; M
Evidence Against McGlade.
John .Sullivan, who worked for the
Street Department in 1S98 as a hodcarrier
and bricklayer, was positive that he had
not signed his name on the alleged forged
document. Witness had not worked in the
department at the time the warrant al
leged on its* face. â¢
Charles Trull, clerk for Bier & Regens
berger, identified receipts signed by Mc-
Glade when he discounted salary war
rants with the firm. -
"When Theodore Kytka took the stand
Lennon made vigorous objection to eve~y
question asked of tho witness by the pros
ecution. Kytka started in to make an ar-
Kument to the jury, but was shut off by
Jodpe Melvin at the request of the do
fense.
The handwriting expert stated that he
had inspected certain papes of writing in
the books of the Street Department, and
had aleo studied the â¢writing' and signa
tures on the "John Sullivan" salary war
rant. Kytka was emphatic in stating that
the same hand had done the writing in
the books and on the salary warrant pro
duced In court.
"The evidence of previous witnesses was
that McGlade had made the entries in the
hooks, and the prosecution hopes to show
by Kytka's expert testimony that Mc-
Glade forged the names on the salary
warrant, obtaining the money for tho
same. m
Kytka, despite the objections of Attor
ney Lennon, was allowed to explain tha
arrangement of samples of handwriting
on the large screen. The witness Informed
the Jury how uÂ« had secured the enlarge
ments from the books of the Street De
partment and from the alleged forged sal
ary warrant.
The enlargements of the admitted hand
writing of McGlado were lettered "G "
and the sample? of disputed handwrltin'e
were lettered "D." 6
While- Kytka was in the midst of his
explanation the hour for adjournment was
reached, and the further hearing of the
case will be resumed this morning at 10

GUESSING WHAT
RULES MAY MEAN
Police i Promotions Subject
of Much Discussion
in Department.
Many Ambiguous , Propositions Pro
Â§ pounded by the Civil Service
Commissioners for Ad- .
vancement in Bank.
If you. are a policeman^ and want to
get a promotion, just remember that the
Civil Service ; Commission has adopted
sundry rules and regulations to give the
candidate an opportunity to guess "who
is who and what. is what."
Secretary Moran has formulated the
rules, for the promotion of members of
the force. But between the lines, ambi
tious, ones are guessing what* may mean
"Meritorious Public Service," "Seniority
in Service" and "Scope of Examination."
These are the three features that count
the most and they are subdivided into
numerous heads. For instance, Secretary
Moran's propaganda reads: -
For the purposes of examination for promo
tion In the Ponce Department meritorious pub
lic service shall be considered ascertained
merit. Merit shall be .ascertained by investi
gating the records of applicants since their
original appointment to the, Police Department.
"Meritorious Public Service" Is also
subdivided into many heads, the relative
value of each proposition being left to
the , fine discernment of the Commission
ers or those who may be called upon 'to
pass upon the worth attached to each
deed of daring. .'Â¦
Here is the gem of thought that leaves
wide open a chance for favoritism:
Meritorious public service is hereby declared
to be service performed In . the line of duty,
which Id of such a nature that it is worthy of
commendation. So that credit may be prop
erly awarded meritorious public service is
hereby divided into the following â¢ three classes,
arranged In the order of their relative excel
lence, that of the highest degree being first:
1. Distinguished service.
2. Highly meritorious jiervlce.
3. Good and faithful service. ;
' Penalties Inflicted. 1'
If a police officer takes one "high ball"
the commission decrees that he is twen
ty-five points off. Should he take the
second, just a century of points is
knocked off his record. His infractions
of discipline are to be regulated according
to the following schedule:
Intoxication. 25 points off: Intoxication (sec
ond conviction). 100 points oft; asleep on duty,
20 points off; absence from beat, 20 points off;
neglect of duty, 10 points off; assault, 20 points
off; exceeding powers, 10 points off; allowins
prisoners to escape, 10 points oft: tardiness, 10
points off: misconduct, in proportion to of
fense, 6-20 points; Insolence to superiors, 13
points off. '
The sum of the penalties for infractions of
discipline shall be deducted from the credit
awarded for meritorious service, and the re
mainder shall be the rate to be given th9 ap
plicant under the heading "meritorious ser
vice" in the examination for promotion.
Under separate heads, each of the vari
ous degrees of qualification for promotion
is Bet forth. A wide-open range for pre
ferment is left to the Commissioners and
examiners, but just wherein the degree
and the difference may come is known
only to those In power.
The rules read that applicants within
the "distinguished service class" "shall
be awarded a credit of 100 on the subject
of meritorious service in an examination
for promotion, provided they have never
been convicted, after a hearing before
thd Police Commissioners, on charges of
conduct subversive of good discipline,
and prejudicial to the best interests of
the Police Department."
Seniority Relative.
"The rating for seniority in service,"
says the report, "should be based upon
the applicant's continuous service In the
Police Department, Including service In
all ranks. As seniority is merely a rela
tive term, the applicant with the least
service 'is entitled to some credit," how
ever small it may be. when compared
with the highest 'credit, awarded the
applicant with the greatest service. This
credit Is to be given not to all the men
in a certain class, nor yet to all of one
class that may apply for examination for
promotion, but only to those that take
the examination. Until the commission
"knows, therefore, who have taken an ex
amination for promotion, it does not
seem possible to establish a schedule of
credits for seniority in service."
Here Is where the Joker comes In, say
pome of ths men aspiring for a chango
in their relative ranks.
"Who is the man that can tell just what
a policeman does." paid a veteran officer
last night. "It looks to me as if the
door was left wide open, 1 , and the deter
mination'of < the merits of any one man
may depend upon personal considerations
of the examiners. '- . '
A number of other recommendations are
made, all trending to the point that the
final determination of every officer's de
mand for preferment shall be left within
the province of the Civil Service Com
missioners and the examiners employed
by them.

Funds to Cleanse Chinatown.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
recommended yesterday that the sum of
$6000 be appropriated to place Chinatown
in a sanitary condition. The money will
be expended by the Board of Health,
which will put a score of Inspectors to
work. The sum of $3000 wag allowed for
the extension of the Twenty-sixth street

J12.000 to its credit The resolution appro
priating $3000 for an engine-house on San

thar a systematic crusade against filth
Jn Chinatown be Inaugurated, and that

Vigorous Action to Be Taken
by Federal and State
Officials.
A DAMAGING chain of evidence
was welded around Peter Mc-
Glade yesterday at the trial of
the ex-bookkeeper of the Street
Department on a charge of forg
ir.g salary warrants.
Yesterday's proceedings were not devoid
of sensations, and at one stage of the trial
it looked as if Attorney Lennon would be
punished for contempt of court on ac
count of his attitude toward District At
torney Ryington. Although warned by
Judge Melvin on the previous day that
bickerings between opposing counsel must
cease, there was a repetition of the ac
tions yesterday. Lennon would hurl
charges at Byington, and the District At
torney would "give as. good." Judge Mel
vin finally lost his patience and told the
attorney* that any further breach of
court rules would be visited with punish
ment.
Attorney I>nnon is making a strenuous
f.pht to save McGlade, and the same pol
icy of objecting to every question of the
prosecution or the introduction of docu
mentary evidence was carried on yester
day.. When Lennon had used up every
known legal objection he objected on
"general grounds." which did not save
him frcm being: overruled.
Kytka Appears as Witness.
Theodore Kytka., the "Sousaesque"
handwriting e*j:-ert. was a prominent fig
ure In the case yesterday. A fifteen-foot
screen, with enlargements of the hand
writing of Peter McGlade and of the writ
ing on the forged "John Sullivan" salary
warrant, was brought into court during
the noon recess. Kytka also piled up
negatives, photographs, microscopes and
flides, until the courtroom took on the as
pect of a Thotographic gallery.
When court convened yesterday morn
ing Attorney I^ennon made a long argu
ment in the hope of being allowed to test
Witness McGinness 1 ability to identify his
own writing by the use of "test signa
tures." The court denied the motion for
the defence, and when Lonnon tried to
pet around the decision by calling Mc-
Ginness to ihÂ» stand and changing the
form of question the objections of the
prosecution were sustained.
I^mion then threatened "to bring the
balance of the City Hall here" to sustain
his contention that McGInness could not
identify his own signature.
J. J. Cathcart. assistant bookkeeper un
dÂ«r McGlade ip 1R3S. was not a wlllinsr
witness. He identified McGlade's writing
in the books of the Street Department.
Â»>ut would not j wear to McGlade's signa
ture on the "John Sullivan" salary war
rant, which is the alleged forged docu
ment. Cathrart was requested to examine
the timebook of the Street Department,
hut he could find no trace of "John Sulli
van" having worked twenty-four days as
a fewer repairer at U per day during
August. 1S3S. The witness further testi
fied that McGlade rtisappeared from the
office in November, IE38.
Judge Melvin Warns Counsel.
PLAN TO CLEAN
CHINESE QUARTER
District Attorney Bylngton then asked
Â«""athcart If the writing In the body of the
"John EulHvan" salary warrant was in
McG lade's hand, to which Attorney Len
non objected, claiming that the document
was not in evidence. Byington retorted
that "the law on the matter has been
quoted many times In this case, and coun
sel ehould know it."
Strong Testimony Is Presented at Trial, Which Again
Results in Wrangle of Counsel.

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report cf A. G. McAdie. section
director of the climate and crop service of
the weather bureau, is as fellows:
"The temperature has continued slightly
sbove ncrraal throughout the State during ths
meek and conditions have been generally favor
able lor the growth of crops and the develop
ment of deciduous fruits. No injurious frosts
have occurred. Drying winds have crusted the
surface feoil in seme localities, but there has
been no serious injury thus far. Light rain
Â«-Â«.u'd be beneficial in all sections. Rain has
falier on the northwe-st coast and In San Diego
County. Light showers are falling to-day tn
the central and north^ro portions of the State.
"Grain continues jr. excellent condition in
reaily all fiectioni". but will need rain very
foon in Southern California and In some por
tions of the San Joaqu!n Valley and the south
ern coast counties. With occasional light
fhowers during the enduing month the yield of
grain should exceed th? average in all parts
of the fc-'ate. Prospects are also good for
large cror= Â«f alfalfa. Pasturage continue!
I'lcntlful iu most sections. Summer fallowing
is progressing and conriderable work is being
den* in cultivating orchards and vineyards.
Irrigating is in rr&grcFS wherever necessary
and water is ptentttoL
"Deciduous fruits are In full bloom in nearly
all t-ecticTis and advancing rapidly. In some
< rcranis the yield of apricots will fall below
last season 1 *, but lt it- said the fruit gives
indit-a-tions cf being much larger. Almonds

f=AN FRANCISCO. March 26, 1301â 5 p. m.
The followins are the seasonal rainfalls to
date, as compared with those of the same date
laet i-eason, and rainfalls in the last twenty-
back to ICO 1 ;. The local traction stocks were
notably weak, declining from 2 to 2%. and
there was especially notable declines In the
Industrial list. Tobacco falling 1 at one time
3 l Â». Amalgamated Copper 2% and Sugar 2
points. Some of the usually quiet stocks
which have enjoyed recent extraordinary ad
vances fell back sharply. The steel stocks
chared In the general weakness and many of
them dropped from 1 to 2 points under last
night. It was after I. early the whole session
had been consumed in this procession of ex
tension of short accounts that the Northern
Pacific movement developed. The bears were
completely routed and found the supply of
etoclu very small, bidding up prices on them
selves by rapid strides. There was an almost
complete recovery in. the general list and
Northern Pacific surged upward 3 l i points to
91%. a record price. The rise In Burlington
reached 4\. It was the current belief in Wall
street that a. reaction was favored by the cap
italists who are heavily committed to the pend
ing great syndicate transactions, owing to the
apprehension that the demands of the ani
mated speculation upon the money market
threaten to exhaust the surplus supplies. The
steady upward course of sterling exchange
grave good ground for the expectation that gold
might go out at an early period. In fact the
report was current tint actual arrangements
had been made for shipments on Saturday's
â¢eteamer. but it is probable that sterling ex
change will have to rise an additional fraction
before exports of gold will be profitable.'

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Dealers are quoting a weak market for both
Potatoes and Onions, 'with no especial feature
to the market. .
Were it not for the canning and Eastern" de
mand for Asparagus, the market for this vege
table would probably be much lower, owing
to the continued heavy receipts. These are
not expected to last very long, however, as
they are already falling off from Bouldin
Island, owing to the canning consumption there.
Rhubarb and Peas keep up, and the latter
are somewhat higher. , The other vegetables
show no changes wortHy of note.
Receipts ' were 1 Wl boxes Asparagus, 810
boxes Rhubarb. 225 sacks Bay Peas and 66

Poultry and Game.
', The Poultry market continues in fine shape
for sellers, receipts being small and the de
mand good. Ducks are higher than for years,
and Hens and young stock are also high. Tur
keys fail to improve like the other kinds, and
In fact are rattier slow than otherwise.

Â¦ Butter, Cheese and Eggs. .
â¢"Another decline in Butter is noted. North
ern orders are falling off and stocks are ac
cumulating.' Receipts are large, and the floors
of the stores are getting cramped for Butter
room.
Cheese Is still quoted firm, but dealers re
port a falling off in the shipping demand.
Stocks of Eggs continue light and the Dairy
Exchange quotes a steady market. The bulk
of the demand, however. Is for cold storage
account, and when that ceases dealers look
for a weaker market.
Receipts as reported by the Dairy Exchange
were: S0.100 pounds of Butter. 1693 cases Eggs,
11,663 pounds California Cheese and pounds
Eastern Cheese.

A " week or ten days aco the local packers
were expecting a weaker market for Hogs about
this time, but they were mistaken. Now they
are expecting a further advance before the week
is out. The rise at Chicago has been so sharp
that it has stopped shipments from Western
and Southern points to this market, and local
supplies are insufficient to supply our wants.
It appears that Hogs are scarce all over the
United States.

The effect of the action taken at New York

To the officers and ' members of the Pacific
Coast Kennel and Specialty Club â Gentlemen:
iThe Pacific advisory committee of the Ameri

of your club to a few facts. In the considera

and opportunity for profit.
It is the desire of this committee to serve
kennel interests by uniting all clubs under the
auspices of the American Kennel Club. In
the recent past this has been not only difficult,
but impossible, on account of the A. K. C.
method of governing coast clubs * and coaet
shows. The points of objection urged In this
behalf have now been so far removed that this
committee feels Justified in asking general
support of the A. K. O. on this coast and the
holding of all coast - kennel shows under A.

CLAIMED.
The regular weekly meeting of the Po
lice Commission was held at the Hall of
Justice last night...- â¢
Patrolman Edward J. RUey was tried
on the charge of neglect of duty. Rlley
was accused of failure to arrest two men
who were fighting In Muller*s saloon, cor
ner of Sutter and Devisadero streets.
Numerous witnesses who were called by
the. commission testified rather in favor
of Rlley, but when Rlley himself tools
the stand his story was so disconnected
and contradictory that little doubt could
be entertained that the accused officer
was ignorant of his duties and negligent
in the discharge of them. The commis
sion unanimously voted that Officer Riley
was guilty and he was accordingly dis
missed from the service.
A 'petition for reinstatement by J. Johns,
who was dismissed from the force in. 1S94,
was denied. Six months' .leave of absence
Â¦was granted- to Patrolman John Kelly. A.
Fanke and W. Winkler, two Dupont-street
saloon-keepers, had their licenses revoked
on account of selling lottery tickets.
/An attempt was made to reinstate Pa
trolman Bernard Harter to the rank of
sergeant, from which he was disrated in
1S94. P. F. Dunne represented Harter,
who offered t{ie petition as a result of
the reinstatement of Lieutenant Price by
Judge Hebbard. The board was ; divided
and -suggested that- the matter- be earned
to the courts. Officers Kelly and Murphy
have similar cases to present.
CommissUmers Mahony and "Wallace fa
vored .the'petitlon and Chairman Newhall
and 'Commissioner Ho well were opposed.
About fifty applications for the reopen
ing of disreputable. saloons were denied
and an enual number, of license applica
tions' were, granted.- 'The commission
voted that, the Civil Service Commission
be requested- to furnish a list oS certified
candidates for the police force. â¢

HOLD WEEKLY MEETING
The receipts of the Postal Department jf the
T7n!te<3 States n^ver can be made to fxjuril the
expenditures. We have the cheapest service
In the world. The deficit, which amounted to
clout $10,000,000 this year, will steadily be
come greater, as the Government ha* now en
tt-red Into a plan of making substantially a
r-creonal delivery to every man In the country.
We have adopted a rural delivery, which In
the next elx years will be ?o developed that
every man living within returnable distance
of the distributing center will have his mall
delivered to him at his residence. This sys
tem when completed will cost $20,000,000. so
tl-at we may never hope to make it self
suFt&lniriff.
When I entered Congress I was an advocate
of the postal telegraph, the parcel delivery
Fvstem and tho postal savings bank, but I
am now or the opinion that these affairs
sl-ould be left to private enterprise. A gov
ernment cannot accomplish work as cheaply
as an individual. The postal telegraph ser
vice in England last year Involved over re
ceipts an expense of $3,000,000. As to the par
eel delivery there is no more reason why the
Government Ehould transport . ten pounds of
matter than why it ihould transport 1.300,000
pounds. K>ep the Government out of business.
I hope that the time shall never come when
railroads may he owned . by the people.

OAKLAND, March 26.â Onnar Bos
well, tha queen of .the gypsies. Is
dead. The aged ruler of . the
Romany tribe succumbed at her
camp,. Thirty-ninth and Adeline
streets, to-day from the effects of injuries
she suffered last Saturday in a collision
of carts on Broadway, near Fourteenth
street. She had been driving in her vehicle
with a granddaughter. _ A buggy driven
by a boy suddenly turned the street cor- ;
ner and struck the gypsy equipage, up- ;
setting It and throwing the venerable
queen and her companion into the street.
As soon as the aged woman had been
removed to her tent It" was found , by the
physician who' was : summoned that she
had suffered several broken ribs and In
ternal injuries. The injured queen, who
was nearly SO years of age. rallied re
markably at the outset, but her. years
were against recovery and death ensued
to-day.
The younger woman escaped from the
accident with a few minor bruises and
cuts.
A strange fatality hangs over the Gypsy
Boswells. A short time ago the tribes
men were called to the bier of Prince
Walter, a son of the dead queen, who
came home from a wandering. trip to die
from pneumonia. He was a proud scion
of the Boswell tribe and the light. of his
mother's eyes.
The queen was. despite the wild and
romantic character of her life, a woman",
of much force of character, and she did
not hesitate to assert at all times her de
mand for allegiance from her gypsy sub
jects.
The Beswells and their followers came
many years ago from England. Their de
scendant? are scattered over a score "of
States. In the West, and especially on
the Pacific Coast, they have been numer
ically strong and wealthy. Â¦
The gypsy queen's husband. Josiah "Bos
well, survives, but he is older than his
consort and will not long stay behind.
'Wherever a gypsy of the Boswell tribe
now roams he will learn by some mys
terious messenger that his queen has gone
across the dark river. . He will mourn in
his own strange fashion for. her. Here, at
tho gypsy encampment there will be a
solemn funeral service, with all. the' sa-

CLAIMS DAMAGES FROM

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 28.â
President Arthur Twining Hadley of Yale
University visited Stanford University to
day as the euett of President Jordan. In
the afternoon the distinguished educator
addressed the students, who had crowded
Assembly Hall to hear him. His topic was
"The University's Trust." He said in part:
There are many ideas as to what constitutes
a university. Some consider it merely aa a
medium to scatter knowledge abroad: a place
where men are trained in miscellaneous fact*.
Another conception la that th* university is
a place for the training: of â¢peclallsts in law,
medicine and . theology. But If we consider It
solely as a place for the production of doctors
of philosophy we make a. mistake, for four
fifths of these who come to a- university come
for the purpose of becoming strong men and
women . In whatever line their UvÂ«s may ca.ll
them.Â«'
The public believes only what it can readily
r.ee, hence overvalues the work of the expert.
The tendency of the university is to cater to
this taste and to turn out. not ten doctors of
philosophy of the flrat rank, but rather five
tlmee as many of the second rank. The uni
versities must correct this evil by the division
of labor. This would be economy of both time
and material and beneficial for all concerned.
In closing President Hadley said â¢ that
the universities must form a trust among
themselves, so that they could improve
their methods of instruction and broaden
the training for graduate students. They
should lessen their antagonism and In
crease their sympathy till every univer
sity could take pride In the good work of
its rivals. To-day the colleges were learn
ing that the establishment of rival col
leges was not a hindrance, but a help, and
college graduates were broad enough to
have an interest * in institutions other
than those from which they graduated.

The amount which will be actually
available at once for construction is not
definite. The trustees have been led to
adopt the pavilion one-story system in
order to start In- a limited way. and to
expand as rapidly as possible. It Is esti
mated that about $6000 a year will be
available for building. Until the finances
have been adjusted it will be difficult to
estimate closely what will be the actual
yearly income from the trust funds. There
Is considerable real and personal prop
erty to be sold before the fund can be
created under the terms of the trust
deed.
The trustees aro now engaged In ar
ranging the details for the trust funds.
Under Its terms they must invest $500,000,
the income of which is to be applied to
maintenance of the hospital. A stipulated
amount will be reserved for building pur
poses. For temporary use the large wood
en buildings now on the property will be
saved, one for administration purposes,
the other probably for a nurses' dormi

The trustees of the Merritt Hospital
have decided to adopt the pavilion plan
for the structures for the Institution for
which provision was made by the late Dr.
Samuel H. Merritt and Mrs. Catherine
Garcelon. his sister. This plan will be
utilized because it will enable the trustees
to build 'additions and to enlarge the hos
pital facilities as funds become available,
and adhere to a general scheme of con
struction, which will be mapped out in the
beginning.
The preliminary surveys of the site, the
Pacific Theological Seminary property,
have been ordered. As eoon as these are
completed architects will be engaged to

Holland that her daughter was In Mexico.
She volunteered no information' as to the
cause of her daughter's sudden dlsap

tell whether she knew anything about it.
MisÂ«= McGraw has undergone the ordeal
of the trial c.f each of her three alleged

years in the penitentiary. Another. John

With dividends assured this autumn from the
product of the new coal lands, the Montezuma
Mining Company has decided for the present
to make only a slight increase In the price of
its shares from month to month. The reason
is simple:' The company Is pledged by resolu-
tion adopted by Us board* of trustees to pay all
its surplus * earnings In dividends to share-
holders (see prospectus, page 10). To obtain
funds, then, for the continued development of
its '24 copper, properties and 'for the building
of a smelting plant on Its own coal lands at
Fairfax (in which smelter the company wtll
burn Its own coke). It la necessary to sell more
stock; and while â¢ It is : generally agreed the
stock . is: to-day worth three times the price
asked, the company fear that to advance the
stock Â¦ to Â¦ Its true value now would/result In
diminished ' sales with consequents-curtailment
of revenue for development purposes. The pay-
ment of. one dividend means the payment of
others,, and after the first it is probable the
stock will be advanced to 60 or 70 cents, while
it, will, certainly- go Â»to par with .the payment
of a; second or third dividend.
This week the stock will be sold for Sc cash
or St on installments. Higher next week.
The State coal Inspector of Washington says
of this coal in his official report to the Gover-
nor: ."The coal is of excellent quality for cok-
ing;- steaming and blacksmithtng purposes."
Intending Investors may easily satisfy them-
selves as to the stable character of the Monte-
zuma proposition. â¢ Write or call for 'full in-

A colored soldier, who stated in the
hearing of James Milworth of Company
G. Twenty-seventh Infantry, yesterday
near the entrance to the Presidio that he
"could whip any white soldier on the
street." now regrets his rashness.. Mil
worth thought differently and proved to
his dusky opponent that there was- at
least one vÂ« - hlte soldier was his mas
ter. The colored soldier was rescued
from . the vigorous attack of Milworth
and escorted within the military reserva
tion by Police Officers W. J. Mangan and
Phil Herring.
Not satisfied with the beating he had
received, the colored fighter hunted for
more. He secured the services of three
of his colored friends and started for Mil-,
worth. The latter was ready, backed up
by Frank Brady and Otto Harding of his
regiment, and the fight was renewed.
The appearance of the colored men and
Incipient Riot Precipitated
by Colored Trooper's
Rash Boast.
NEGRO SOLDIERS
AND WHITE CLASH
the prospect of a fight quickened the
blood of the hundreds of soldiers who
were on the street and they determined
to take a hand in the affair.
They crowded around the -fighting white
men and negroes and the.- police, officers
were in difficulties in the twinkling of an
eye. With cries of "Lynch them!" they
surged around the fighting men. The ef
forts of the officers â¢ were of no avail.
They were determined to get their hands
on the colored men.
Police Sergeant Campbell, seeing that
mere talk would not control the soldiers
ordered his small force, to draw their
pistols, and surround thejlghters. The
sight of the weapons in tne hands of the
police had a quieting effect. - The mob
melted away and the officers then took
the negroes inside the Presidio gate and
spent the rest of the afternoon preventing
the soldiers from gathering in crowds. .
The question of w;iges and a desire to
pet rid of an objectionable overseer nam<?d
Todd seem to be the grievances of the
men who arc now out on strike at the
Union Iron Works. The men are de
tormined also that the present plan of
employing apprentices shall be changed,
that Tcdd must go and other minor dlf
lercnces be arranged before they will re
fcume work.
In these contentions th'y have the moral
support, it is claimed, of their fellow
workmen, but so far the strike has only
alfected the men engaged in the ship
fittir-g department. But that it may
spread further is not denied by other em
ployes. \
One of the great objections made is to
the apprentice clause in the contracts that
those entering the works are compelled
to sign
"It savors of the cid system." said one
cf the passed apprentices yesterday. "For
instance, a boy signs for $3 per week for
the first year. He *s penalized 5 cents for
a half-day on Saturday, although he may
work the full timo>. and really receives
only $2 S5 for his WK-k's pay. Then in his
second year, when he is entitled to $4 per
week, a proportionate deduction is mad*,
and soon through all the years of his ap
prenticeship. But even after he has ful
filled the terms of Ult> agreement and is
qualified to do a. man's work he is denied
the opportunity. Tod-l hires" men and puts
them at any occupation he sees fit, finally
displacing the young men who have en
deavored to learn tn;ir business."
Such, in brief, was ine opinion expressed
t-y a representative d the striking fitters
at a meeting held last night. Each em
ploye seemed confident that the strike
would extend further and embrace other
lines of^tradc. Out at the works every
thing v.ws quiet and no one was interfere!
with, although later an attempt may be
made to prevent "scabs" from taking the
jobs of the men who have voluntarily
walked out.
Under the apprentice system the re
quirement is that each one shall work 3000
hours per year. Failure to complete the
full Quota of time assigned means a de
duction in pay. To break up this system
and knock out the "handy man," or help
er, seems to be the object of the strikers.
At their meeting last night many fiery
speeches were made and many resolutions
passed. It was definitely decided that
none will return to work until all griev
ances are settled and every effort will be
made to call out other branches of trade.
A meeting was also held in the Potrero
Opera-house during the afternoon. It was
addressed by a representative of the ship
hands, the men who run the shears,
planes and drills, and all agreed that if it
v.cre necessary they would stand with the
ttrtkers.
The committee appointed to meet Su
perintendent John T. Scott reported that
after two meetings with him they were
unable to reach an agreement. He in
formed them that they could return to
their work under the same conditions as
before, but that he would not discharge
any cf the so-called "handy men." against
whoiri so much objection was raised. A
fctcond meetins was held and Scott is re
ported to have said:
"Well, boys, your money is ready for
you if you want it and whenever you
want it."
The incident closed when the strikers
informed him that no further parley
would bo had with him and that if be
dtsired to call the men back he would
have to send for the committee.
Something over 1003 men. It is said, are
affected b;- the strike. Owfng to the de
lay over ax> riveters and 150 rivet boys are
out cf employment. The blacksmiths can
rot work if the litters do not keep them
supplied with v,-ork. The threat that the
work on two cruisers may be sent to other
yards does not seem to bother the men.
as they claim that Congressional require
ments demand that they shall be built on
this coast.
If all other means fail, it is the inten
tion of the strikers to endeavor to call out
nil olher workers in the Union Iron Works
and precipitate the impending strike out
lined in The Call on Monday.
Yf tt UGH TEVIS is to wed Miss Cor
1â41 nelia McGhee Baxter. The en-
I I gagement was announced yes-
JJL JX terday afternoon and caused
quite a flutter over the Lenten
tea cupsÂ» The wedding is to take place ln j
the near future, probably during Easter
week. The betrothal of Mr. Tevis and
Miss Baxter is the closing: chapter of a 5
pretty romance. Only a little more than
a month ago the couple met at Monterey,
where the lady had come from her home
in Denver to recuperate after an attack
of pneumonia. It was a case of love at
.first sightâ at least on the gentleman's
part.
Miss Baxter, the fair bride-to-be, is a
Denver belle. She is the eldest daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. George White Baxter,
prominent socially In Wyoming. Colorado
and in Tennessee, where the family origi
nally came from. Miss Baxter i sonly 13
years old, but has achieved a reputation
as a beauty, not only in her own State
and in the East, but in Europe as we'l.
She was educated in New York and at
the Sacred Heart Convent in Paris. She
is personally very attractive. She is tall,
willowy and blonde, and in addition
has all the charm and grace that refine
ment and education alone can give.
Although the acquaintance of Mr. Tevla .
and his fiancee dates back only a few'
weeks, the Baxter family and Mr. Tevia
have known each other for several yeaib.
Mr. and Mrs. Baxter have come for the
last three years to this coast to -escape
the rigors of the Denver winter and thj
acquaintance of Mr. Tevis. ' which was
made during their first visit here, has
been renewed with pleasure on- each sub
sequent occasion. .
When the Baxters , first left their Ten
nessee-home they . wetit to ' Wyomlns,
where Mr. Baxter engaged in ranching.
Eight years ago he was elected Governor
of Wyoming and after' his term of office

A POPULAR DENVER BELLE
Grant says that I the ! Santa Fe - people
have had the subject under consideration;
but he will not admit that he has acted
as their agent. . He says that if he ser
cures the property he expects to dispose
of it to advantage, if not to the Santa :Fe
then to some one else. He points out
possible extensions of the road, either
across to Walnut Creek, up the San-Ra
mon Valley, thence into the Llvermore
Valley, with possible connection with, the
Corral Hollow: road; or out by Clayton
Canyon- to Modesto and ' on into, the
mountains; or on to Bay Point and New
York â¢'â¢ Landing, across the San Joaquln
and. up towards. Dlxon. With these pos
sibilities he regards" the property a? val
uable, whether, the Santa .Fe wants; it
or not. "
Captain . A. H. - Payson, Â¦ vice president
of the Santa Fe,- says that as far as -his
knowledge goes, there has been.no nego
tiation on the part, of his. company.* to
secure ' the' California and Nevada .Rail
road property. He looks upon -Grant's
investment as a private venture, though,
as he states, he do':s not know what as
surances may have been given- to .Grant
by President Ripley. ..â¢..â¢"..;
A committee representing . the . commer
cial bodies of Oakland .was appointed. in
November, 1899. to devise ways and means
to induce the Santa Fe to enter Oakland,
and it is now preparing to reportUo the
City* Council. M.". J. * Keller, representing
the Board of Trade, said yesterday that
the committee had had many conferences
with the 'Santa Fe officials ; and .", knew
that important transactions awaited â¢ the>
termination of this litigation.
Santa Fe's Opportunity.
. The foreclosure ouit now pending was
brought by the Central -Trust Company
of New York for tlu bondholders on the
ground of default In the payment of . in
terest. There can bc ; no defense estab
lished in the case and a decree is certain
in the near future uniess those who want
to prevent any transler of the property
enter other exceptions to the report- of
the master in chancery .which Is before
Judge Morrow.- Â¦' ..'
If a foreclosure sale Is ordered, Grant,
as the holder of a 'large share of the
bonds, will be able to â¢ outbid any out
sider, and he will doubtless be the pur
chaser - of â¢Â¦' the property.- The right of
way will then be ready for disposal and
the presumption is that , the Santa . Fe
will acquire it.. . Â¦ .- : . . . > .\ : <
The California and Nevada; Railroad is
twenty-two miles long. It, reaches % the
bay just north of the Oakland race track,
on Fortieth street. It extends northward
to Old. San Pablo and. then doubles back
up San Pablo Creek to Bryant.' A - mile
and a half only -separates the Santa Fe
track from the line'of the California and
Nevada Railroad at Old. San Pablo. The
acquirement ol right of way for that dis
tance and the purchase- of the" narrow

now owns 30S of the S45 bonds of the Cali

number 230 were held by Charles H. Smith,
and his title to them was cleared by Judge
Morrow's decision. A . total of 304 bonds
were concerned in the suit- brought by
Smith, but fourteen of them had been
conditionally transferred f.o relatives.
Smith entered into a contract to sell '290
bonds to Grant. Of that number 100 were
delivered. The remaining 190 were In the
possession of the California Safe Deposit

At this season the housekeeper must look spe-
cially after the baking powder.
As she cannot make good cake with bad eggs, no
more can she make cake that is light, delicious arid
dainty with inferior baking powder.
Royal Baking Powder is indispensable for the
preparation of the finest food. It imparts that pe-.
t culiar lightness, sweetness and flavor noticed in the
finest cake, biscuit, doughnuts, crusts, etc., which
expert bakers say is unobtainable by the use of any
other leavening agent.
