claimed.. Information received at' the

quire reimbursement fur the expense they
have incurred and tho losses sustained.
But even with Russia and France votlntf
with the United States, Great Britain and

moderation, so that. It was comparatively
easy to obtain rejection of the blood*

presented, as there Is ' the, question of

Praises American Wagons.
Another dispatch from Lord Roberts on
the subject of the South African cam
paign, dated April 2, has been published
In the Gazette. It. largely concerns the
transport service and says the mule trans
port consisted of what are called in South
Africa buck wagons, carrying a load of
3500 pounds, drawn by ten mules each,
with two native drivers. After mention
ing the serviceable wagons made in Cape
Colony and the frequent re-tiring and
other repairs, which the English-made
wagons required, Lord Roberts said:
"Six buck wagons were imported for
trial from the United "States: These
proved to be superior to any other pat
tern of either Cape or Englioh manufac
ture. The wheels were of hickory, the
bodies of black walnut and the metal
work of steel. The superiority of these
vehicles was doubtless due to the fact
that mule wagons are largely used in
America for the carrying of goods as well
as for military transport. The manufac
turers have therefore learned by practical
experience what is the best type of wagon
and what are the most suitable materials
in building them. It may be added that
the wagons in question cost considerably
less than the Bristol pattern wagons."
. Lord Roberts, in his dispatch, goes over
all branches of the service, and in review
ing the hospital department mentions the
American hospital ship Maine, "fitted out
and maintained by the splendid generosity
of private individuals and the committee
of American ladies."

Thus the powers will have' to consider

northern lines will have to sell direct to

G. W. Luce, Los Angeles agent for the

ingratitude by his confreres. He was in

its special train in Los Angeles and to
travel upon it to Del Monte. The train
stopped over night at Paso Robles. Luce
this morning procured an old cloth ban

in bold letters the legend "The Old Maids'

of one of . the coaches. The train pulled
into Del Monte with the sign in plain

ment at Manila, was 'not implicated. He
said that Colonel Woodruff was one of
the ablest men in the service and that
his honesty was unquestioned. He assert-
ed that Colonel Woodruff was "ignorant of
the fact that Harold M. Pitt, manager of
Evans & Co., the army contractors, was
leasing him the house in which he lived
for much less rental than ;Pitt had paid
therefor. On discovering this Colonel
Woodruff immediately vacated the house.
Deceived by Manager Pitt.
Pitt is alleged to have said that Cap
tain Read of the commissary department
deceived Colonel Woodruff, who thought
Captain Read to be thoroughly honest.
The irregularities in commissary matters
were first attributed to Captain Read's
unfamlliarity with commissary work.
Colonel Woodruff was reluctant to believe
that frauds were being perpetrated, but

WASHINGTON, . April 16.â Secretary
Root to-day cabled General MacArthur
asking for additional information con â¢
cerning the reports of frauds in Manila.
It is expected that a reply will be re
ceived to-morrow. While definite instruc
tions have not been given General Mac-
Arthur heretofore to make a searching
and complete investigation, it is under
stood that the requests for information
were of a character to imply that the de
partment expected such an investigation
shotild be made. Nothing definite has
been received from General MacArthur
about the alleged frauds, although refer
ence has been made to the investigation
in cablegrams received. /The first dis
patch on the subject from Gener.al Mac-
Arthur said that there had been exagger
ation in the press reports,, but the persis
tence with which the reports have been
reiterated and the news dispatch to-day
giving names and specific amounts have
indicated to the department officials that
perhaps General MacArthur was not ad
vised fully when he made his first report.
It can be stated that the department in
tends to have all the information possible
on the subject and General MacArthur
will be expected to push the trials anil
make a complete report of any and all
wrongdoings. A
Major George B. Davis, whose name Is

from her arms, hands, feet, breast/ the

piercing the epidermis. . ;Â¦

This latter treaty, unlike most of the

Senate for action, was . never published,
and still remains Under the seal of confi

generally the same ground covered by the
treaty between Chile and Nicaragua. It
so happens that the United States has no
trade treaty with Nicaragua of . recent
date and under the old treaty there Is no
warrant for the preference pt a claim by
our Government for equal rights with
Chile,. inasmuch as we have not seen fit to
enter " into similar special arrangements

CLARK ROAD TO HAVE
OUTLET TO ATLANTIC
The message received in this city to-day was merely one of many sent to
the numerous agents of the road. It announced simply the fact of the Clark,
Burlington and Pennsylvania combination. ' 'It emanated from the president
of the biggest railway system in. the country outside the Harnman syndicate.
.,â¢ Simultaneously with the private information of this latest combination
corn.es the published statement that the Burlington management has ordered
the surveying and building of its extension to proceed with all dispatch from
Guernsey, Wyo., 200 miles through the Laramie | Mountains, to Salt Lake.
Once into Salt Lake, over the right of .way already secured, the Burlington
will have a direct line to Chicago, passing within a short distance of Senator
Clark's immense copper properties in Montana. The road runs through the
northeastern corner of Wyoming, through Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and
through Illinois to Chicago, "where it connects with the Pennsylvania system,
running directly to New York. Â¦ Â¦ ' ; \ Â¦ I .,
At the present time, the Harriman syndicate controls every line running
out of Salt Lake and Ogden except the .Burlington. Figuring the Burling
'.ton as an inevitable acquisition of the Great Northern, or of the Southern
Pacific, the wise ones In railroad matters. have not been able to. see where
Clark could make his proposed road pay by' making its Eastern terminal
point at Salt Lake. Arrived there his freight and passengers would fall into
the hands of the Harriman syndicate, which organization could. place upon
them whatever price it pleased. It could at least fix its rates so that the
only business Clark's road could handle at a profit would be local traffic
between Salt Lake and Los Angeles. The Great Northern has assiduously
claimed an_option. on the Burlington, the one route east from the Salt Lake
end of the Clark road not tied up, while the Harriman syndicate" has insisted
that Gould ctjuld break into the Pennsylvania line at any time-; he desired
and turn thafc system, over to the syndicate. *Â¦ Â¦_Â¦â¢ ' Â¦' ' ' Â¦ ; Â¦ / " Â¦ - :'
Recent developments have demonstrated that Hill cannot get 'the Burling
ton for money or any other consideration, and that the Pennsylvania system
cannot be touched ' by any one. The .two lines, forming as they do the key to
the "Western situation, have been fought for with money and every other com
mercial weapon by the syndicate, but they have withstood the assault. Why
they have resisted tremendous- cash offers no one has been able to understand,
but now the secret of^ their persistent . refusal arid- the reason 'for Senator
Clark's absolute confidence is revealed.
LOS ANGELES, April 16.â The Salt Lake, San Pedro and Los Angeles
railroad will find its way to New York City and. a deep-water "Atlantic
terminal by way of the Burlington -tailroad and the j Pennsylvania- short
lines. Information to this effect was received to-day in a cipher dispatch to
a well-known San Francisco railroad man now in this city.
Special Dispatch to Tlie Call.
â¢ When the time came to make a payment un
der the contract Carter, who was located at
.Savannah and had charge of the work on be-
Kalf of the Government, would 'give to the rep
resentatives of Greene and'the Gaynors. locally
in charge at Savannah, a Government check
puf ficient to pay for the labor and materials
vhich actually went into the improvement and
then- he -would -draw- a.- Government-check for
the excess of. the contract price, representing
what the gamblers- would call the "velvet" â
I the fruit of the fraudulent conspiracy and, ptft-
I ting this in his Docket, would go to New York.
There he would meet Greene and- Gaynors.
Tften the division would take place.' Carter
would --be specially allowed out of the amount
$75 for traveling expenses and the baiancq
v.-ould be divided into thirds â one-third going" to
Carter, one-third to Green and one-third to the
Gaynors. In this way Carter drew out of the I
cc-nsftiracy .$722,528 02. and of this amount the I
records- of stockbrokers in New^ York show that |
he invested Jn stocks and bonds $690,301 So. For
Ws .traveling expenses Carter received $1575. He
made twenty-one trips of New York on this
mission and at the time was in excellent con
dition financially to be appointed military at
tache at-the Court of St. James.'i .. 'Â¦
Carter Divided "Swag."
Mr. Richards then details the method
pursued by the captain In his operations,
saying that "the division of 'swag 1 was
attended to by Carter/personally." '
Solicitor Richards continues:
Mr. Richards says that ! the Investiga
tions of the Government reveal the loss of
an aggregate of $2,169,159 through Carter's
operations, of which he (Carter) received
one-third, with traveling expenses added.
In view of these facts Mr. Richard3 asks:
"Is It any wonder that Carter* wants to
get out on ball? Is it any wonder that he
desires to be put in a position where he j
can personally handle the sinews of war |
which he obtained by fraud from the I
Government that educated him and gave
him his standing and reputation? What
bail could the court fix that would be suf- j
ficient in his "case, if he has sent his se
curities out of the country and made up j
his mind that the best he could do would j
be to follow them?" .
Since Carter has dragged into this case the
fact that he Is under indictment along with
Greene and the Gaynors and has* sworn that
the criminal case cannot be tried because of
his absence from Georgia, and asserts that he
wants to be released bo he may demand a
trial by jury lit- Georgia and prepare for ' It.
it Is proper for me to call the attention of the
court to the fact .-that if the criminal case
cannot be tried without Carter, neither can
it be tried without- his co-consplrators, Greene
and the Gaynora -Yet,, ever Blnce the indict
ment was found; in December, 18S9. the Gov
ernment has been, strenuously endeavoring to
secure the removal of Greene and the Gaynors
from New York to Georgia for trial.
This affidavit is supplemented by affi
davits from the warden and physician of
the prison.
-'As to the second ground for release on
ball the Solicitor General says in part:
As to the first ground the Solicitor Gen
eral submits an argument tending to show
Carter's sound mental condition and. files
with the court the affidavits of five phy
sicians who examined Carter and affirm
In closing that "Carter Is not now suffer
ing neurasthenia": that he Is not on the
verge of nervous- collapse; that his ner
vous condition is not greater than we
would expect to find in a healthy person
of said Carter's .. standing confined In
prison. -Affiants further say that said Car
ter Is now physically and mentally
sound."

HAVANA. April 16.â The commission
appointed by the Cuban Constitutional
Convention to go to Washington and lay
before President McKinley the desires of
the convention regarding the future irela
tions between Cuba and the United States
will leave here Saturday. General Wood
will present the commission to the Presi
dent. He will leave here Friday and go to
Washington by way of Tampa, Fla, The
Cuhfln commission which is to visit Wash
ington consists of Senores Diego, Tamayo,
Capote, Berriel, Portuondo and Lierente.
The President will not have much time
to devote to the Cuban envoys. He is very
busy now attending to small matters and
getting everything in readiness for his
tour of the country. This tour begins on
April 29. The Cuban committee will prob
ably not arrive here until three or .four
days before the President Is ready to
start. As already pointed out, the Presi
dent will absolutely refuse to hold any
conference with a view to . modifying the'
terms of the Platt amendment. ; This
amendment, being an act of Congress,
cannot be changed except by an act of
Congress, and the President will frankly
tell the committee so. It is expected that
the committee, however, will see and hear
much In Washington to convince its mem
bers that the best interests of their island
will be served by an acceptance of the
American terms. Secretary Root said to
day that the committee appeared to be
an excellent one. He. however, is only
acquainted with two of its members, Sen
cres Tamaj'O and Capote, with whom he
discussed Cuban affairs when he last vis
ited the Island.
The failure of the Cuban convention to
accept the terms of the Platt amendment
has been described in quarters hostile to
General Wood as due to General Wood's
lack of diplomacy. Cuban newspapers
have asserted that the appointment of a
committee to come to Washington was a
"slap" at General Wood. The President
has every confidence In General Wood's
ability and Integrity. It is characteristic
of him to stand by any well meaning offi
cial in whom he has confidence whenever
that official is attacked. He did It in the
case of Admiral Sampson and Secretary
of War Aleer and is now doing it in the
case of Penrlon Commissioner Evans, who
is under a continuous fire from pension
attorneys.
Special Dlepatch. to 'The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, April 16.-President.
McKinley Is determined to make it clear
that the appointment by the Cuban Con
stitutional Convention of a committee to
come to Washington does not prejudice
General Wood In his eyes. This' is shown,
by the fact that General Wood has-beÂ£Â«
ordered to Washington in advance of the
committee. General Wood is expected
here on next Monday or Tuesday, a couple
of days ahead of the Cuban commission.
He will talk over the whole situation with
the President, and when the committee
arrives he will receive them and present
them to the President, and will probably
be present at the interviews which will
follow.

The scheme of improvement, as con
templated, provides for the extensive
beautifying of that portion of thÂ« estuary
south of -the dam.
The opening of Ninth and Tenth streets
to Fallon street, the completion of the
proposed park along the estuary arm be
tween Twelfth and Eighth streets and the
reconstruction of Twelfth street dam are
public improvements comprehended in a
series of preliminary- moves made last
night by the City Council.
A resolution was introduced calling up
on the City Engineer to prepare immedi
ately plans and estimates of the cost of
rebuilding the dam, the condition of
which has been not only an eyesore, but a
serious menace to the heavy traflic be
tween Easf Oakland and the. West Side.
The resolution provides also for the im
provement of Twelfth street from Oak
street to First avenue. This includes the
dam and the approaches on each side.
The matter .was referred: to the commit
tee of the whole. -'â¢ '
The next Step was the recommendation
to create a park, as proposed two years
ago, of that property lying between
Eighth street bridge and the dam. These
plans will be fully discussed in public be
fore adoption.
The opening of Ninth and Tenth streets
will give an outlet to the proposed park.
The property has been utilized by private
parties, but assurance has been given that
there will be no. claim of title when the
city s"hall be ready to cut through. The
Street Committee was given charge of the
resolution, which provides that all ob
structions must be removed within twen
ty days after the adoption of the reso
lution. The Council's proposed action is
based upon the declaration that the
streets named are necessary for use aa
public highways, that the crossings of
the estuary at Eighth street and Twelfth
street may be reached by way of Fallon
street.

WASHIXGTOX, April 16.â The financial
condition of Japan at present Is far from
encouraging, and the bankers, statesmen
and business men are exerting every ef
fort to avert a pending panic. This state
ment is conveyed to the State Department
in a communication from United States
Consul Bellows at Yokohama. The situ
ation, as analyzed by the shrewdest finan
ciers and statesmen of the empire, show
that the Chinese indemnity secured at
the close of the Japan-China war, to
gether with large national loans, led to
the exploiting of many public and private
undertakings, which caused money to be
unusually plentiful among the coolie or
hiboring classes. This induced extrava
gant methods of living, and is' assigned as
a potent factor In the large Increase of
Imports. The amount of^indemnity paid
by China proved insufficient for the en
terprises projected, and many millions
were diverted from the customary chan
nels of trade to carry forward the under
takings referred to. .
ThÂ» Interruption of the Chinese trade
brought a falling off in exports also dur
ing the past year.- In 1000 the relations of
Japan's exports to her imports stood at
the ratio of five to six, and $24,900,090
passed out of the country to settle Japan s
trade balances. Foreign capital, it Is
stated, declines to enter the Japanese
market although tempted by flattering
rates of interest. Living expenses have
increased during the past few years over
75 per cent, which causes the scarcity of
money for commercial and industrial pur
poses to be all the more keenly felt.
The Consul General closes his report by
saying:
"The closeness of the money market
combined with the dullness of trade and
violent fluctuations of prices, is causing
much alarm among merchants, manufac
turers and bankers, and more failures are
imminent."

NERVOUS DYSPEPSIA.
Â¦Â¦â¢r. : ' r -
A CUBE FOR IT.
Not a Patent Cure-Ail, Hot b Modern
Miracle, but Simply a Rational
Cure for Dyspepsia.
In these days of humbu&grery and decep-
tion the manufacturers of patent medi-
cines, as a rule, seem to thinK their medi-
cine? will not sell unless they claim that
It will cure every disease under the sun.
And they never think of leaving out dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. â¢ They are
sure to claim that their nostrum is abso-
lutely certain to cure every dyspeptic and
he TTeed look no further.
In the face of these absurd claims It is
refreshing to note that the proprietors of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have carefully
retrained from making any undue claims
. or false representations regarding the
merits of this most excellent remedy for
dyspepsia and stomach troubles. They
make but one claim for it, and that is,
that for indigestion and various stomach
] troubles Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is a
radical cure. They go no farther than
' this and any man or woman suffering
from indigestion, chronic or nervous dys-
pepsia, who will give the remedy a trial
w 111 find that nothing is claimed for it
that the facts will not fully sustain.
It is a modern discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable Ingredients acceptable
a to the weakest or most delicate stomach.
Its preat success in curing stomach
troubles is due to the fact that the medl-
eaJ properties are such that it will digest
Â¦whatever wholesome food is taken into
the stomach, no matter whether the
stomach is in good working order or not.
It rests the overworked organ and re-
plenishes the body, the blood, the nerves,
creating a healthy appetite, gives refresh-
ing sleep and the. blessings which always
accompany a good digestion and proper
assimilation of food.
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets no
dieting is required. Simply eat plenty of
Â¦wholesome food and take . these Tablets
at each meal, thus assisting and resting
. the stomach which rapidly regains . its
. proper digestive power, when the Tablets
' will be* no longer required. - -
Nervous Dyspepsia, is simply a condition
in which some portion or portions of the
nervous system are not properly nour-
ished. Good digestion invigorates the ner-
vous system and every organ in the body.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. are sold by

SAN LUCAS, April 16.â The oil situation

at a standstill during the past two weeks,
although v/ork is being vigorously prose

has secured the right to bore wells on
land contiguous to the Tomboy. He saye
that the main oil vdu will most certainly
be struck in a few <2nys by the Tomboy.

Glllis, W. T. Sesnon and others for rein
statement as part owners with the defend-?
ants in certain valuable oil lands in Kern

fraud and misrepresentation they were in
duced by Carmichael and Sesnon, " for a
few hundred dollars, to part with lands
which the defendants knew at the time
to be worth many thousands. On the
other hand, the defendants set up the
claim that Clark and Booth were quite
willing to part with their land at the fig
ure paid, believing that they were realiz
ing a good profit, and they declare that
no misrepresentation was used.
Owing to the prominence of the princi

WATSONVILLE, April 16.â Since the
running of through trains commenced
over the coast division, wrecks have been
of almost daily occurrence, Many ascribe
the frequency of these accidents to an at
tempt to make too fast time on poorly bal
lasted roadbed; others say that they are
due to the fact that many of the en
gineers and firemen- are not acquainted
with the coast division and necessarily do
not know the weak spots along the line. .
Near Vega Station, three miles from
Watsonvllle, the fast Sunset freight train
was wrecked shortly after 6 o'clock this
morning. It was due at Pajaro at o:30
o'clock and was making extremely fast
time down the valley, over the straight
away track, when it was suddenly stopped
in the race and fifteen of the twenty-nine
freight cars were piled in a heap on both
slde3 of the track. The two engines and
six freight cars in front and the seven
freight cars and caboose on the rear end
were not damaged. " Â¦ Â¦
The wrecked cars were all heavilyi laden
with through freight, with the -exception
of the car that caused the accident. This
car was empty, and, as the train was go
ing at such a high rate of speed, it is be
lieved-that the car kept hitting the rails
so hard that it broke the flange of one of
the wheels on the rear truck. 'After the
breaking of the flange the train kept on
its course for several hundred feet until
the car, with the rear truck off the rails,
reached a cattleguard, where the smash
up took place. ; . .â¢
Luckily none of the train crew were In
close proximity to . any of the wrecked
cars and there . was no loss of Â¦ life. The
train was in charge of Conductor James
Frances and on the head engine was En
gineer Hays,' who is said to be a' nephew
of C. M. Hays, president of the Southern
Pacific Company.
One of the wrecked cars was filled with
a shipment of Wieland barrel beer packed
in ice. While the car was badly broken,
the barrels of iced beer came out of the
scuffle unscatched and they remained in
that excellent condition until the "Willy
Thirstys" began tapping and partaking of
their cooling and exhilarating contents.
â¢ A wrecking crew arrived later ifi the
morning and. by evening had temporary
track laid around the wreck that per
mitted the several north and sound bound
passenger trains to go by. â¢ The loss to
the railroad company will foot up several
thousand dollars. '. Â¦ ,

In the mission that brought her to the

Mrs. Horn Is a fascinating brunette of
18. A year ago she met Horn at Philips,
her home In Nebraska, and after a short
courtship they were married. The honey
moon lasted until a month ago, when
Horn deserted his young bride. Since
that time she has heard nothing of him.
Some of Horn's friends told the girl he
had gone to California and she deter
mined to follow him. Her Â¦ parents ob
jected, as they could not afford the trip
and believed it would be useless. . The girl
was persistent and said she would go if
she had to walk. Her father is a member
of the Woodmen of the World and .that
lodge donated the necessary funds and the
girl started for the coast. She reached San
Jose last Friday, having only 11 cents In
her possession. She had no baggage and
her only worldly possessions were the
clothes on her back. Her stepmother had
hidden her clothing, hoping to keep the
girl from carrying out her plans.
Upon reaching San Jose Mrs. Horn
Journeyed wearily to the police station,
but Chief Kidward, after making a num
ber of inquiries, could give her no infor
mation relative to her husband. Through
the Chief's kind-heartedness enough
money was raised to send her to her Ne

Two Men Who Attempt to Restrain

allegations were made on the witness
stand In Justice Parker's court this Af
ternoon by Benjamin Kohlbcrg,.a whole

cerning C. H. Benham, lecal agent of the
New York Mutual Life Insurance : Com
pany. Kohlberg was sued on two notes
of $125, each assigned by Benham. to a
local collector.
According to Kohlberg's story Benham
asked him to havr* his life insured for a
large amount, but Kohlberg said he coulÂ«J
not do it owing to the fuct that a kidney
trouble would prevent his passing tbe
examination. Benham, so Kohlberg says,
declared that that oould easily be ar
ranged by substituting false proof for the
examining physician to pass upon. Tbis
was done, and Kohlberg passed the ex
amination. Later, , however. He learned
that should this be .found out it .'would
vitiate the policy and he would get noth
ing for- his money, so he gave up the pol
icy to Benham and declined to pay -the
premium, amounting in all to $250. He
had given his notes for the amount pre
viously. Benham declined to accept the
policy, and when one of the note3 became
due he assigned them for collection. â¢

trouble. After using other remedies .without satisfaction I decided to try Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, which is prepared in my own city and recommended by so
many Binghamton people. Within a short time I realized | a marked improve-
ment, and in a reasonable time a complete cure was accomplished. It has been
some time since I have had to use any of the remedy, and I have no. fear of a
recurrence of the trouble. Two of my fellow carriers (E. J. Casey and S. C.
Sweeney) have also used Swamp-Eoot tor about the same difficulty as mine, and
with exactly the same results, and they gladly Join me in recommending the
remedy to any one who suffers from klcney, liver .or bladder disprders. Very
truly yours, " ,

kidneys are in need of immediate atten-
S^amp-Root is pleasant to take and ia

WHEN Miss Ruth Louise Wins
low, daughter of C. R. Wins
low, pressed the electric but
ton at the Union Iron Works
yesterday morning the North
Pacific Coast Railroad's magnificent new
feathering paddle-wheel ferryboat Tamal
pais glided gracefully from her cradle out
into the waters of the bay. The ceremony
of launching was accomplished without a
single mishap. As the last restraining
block was knocked frcm beneath the
boat's stern and she started down, the de
clivity, little Miss Marguerite Doe, the
adopted daughter of President J. B. Stet
son of the North Pacific Coast Railroad,
broke a bottle of champagne against her
bow and christened her Tamalpals. The
launching was witnessed by the officers
of the railroad and hundreds of visitors.
The new ferryboat, which will be used
to carry passengers between this city and
Sausalito, has been constructed on plans
similar to those upon which the Berkeley
â¢was built. The apartments for passen
pers are especially commodious and are
artistically ornamented with pictures of
vessels and nautical scenes. The seating
capacity is S20, while it is estimated that the
vessel can comfortably transport between
S000 and 4000 passengers. The crew's
berths, the bar and the restaurant are all
below the deck. The day for the trial
trip has not yet been set, but it is ex
pected that the Tamalpals will be ready
for her commission in about ten days,
when she will take the place of the San
Rafael on the Sausalito route. The San
Rafael will be held in reserve, to be used
in case of accident.
The new boat, it is expected, will have a
ppeed of fourteen knots. Her displace
ment is 14W tons, depth of hold, 16 feet 2
inches: depth, molded, 17 feet 2 inches;
breadth of overguards, 64 feet; breadth of
hull, 3S feet; length over all, 235 feet, and
length between perpendiculars, 223 feet.

of Soo Ho Mon and Ho Mon, charged with
murder, it was discovered that a diagram

Corporal Russell of the- Police Depart

former trial, could not be found. It had
been in the custody of "W. Jost. the former
clerk of the court, but he could not throw
any light on the subject of its disappear
ance. The Judge had to continue the case
till this afternoon, by which time Cor
poral Russell will have another diagram
ready.
One of the jurors examined was Samuel
E. Dutton, who was a juror in the Durr

juror in a case where the death penalty
might be Imposed. I

took '"no part in the looting of China, and now the
British, German, French and Japs 'deny that their
troops had any hand in it. Evidently it was the car.
The Louisville boy-husband who killed his girl-wife

Bryan has a right to call his weekly whatever he

The latest New York novelty is the organization of

Tom L. Johnson, the nearly elected Mayor of Cleve
land, is said to have ona eye on a seat in the United
States Senate and the ether on the Governorship, 50
it would seem he will have to go it blind so far as the
cil3 - is concerned.
The 14-year-old Chicago boy who killed himself the
c^her day because he had not the financial means witii
vhich to continue his studies certainly took a short
cut for zt least one kind of learning.
It is announced by the Washington Post that all
white tents now in use by the United States army nre
to be called in and khaki tents substituted in place
of them. The modern gun has become so far-reaching
with it's projectiles and modern gunners so accurate-in
aim it is unsafe for an army to give an enemy any kind
of a target. Hereafter the name of the color of a
"tented field" r.ill be mud. > If.
That Bryari fully understands the situation is made
evident by his comments in the last number of, the
Fleming has no such far-reaching policy. He has
no other object than that of Democratic success, and
he advocates reorganization only because success can
riot be attained unless the Democratic party can win
back the favor of -those whom it alienated by the
Chicago platform. In a recent statement on the
subject he said: "The rock upon which Democracy
split in twain in the last two campaigns was the free
coinage of silver. Thai obstacle ought no longer to
impede our progress or divide our forces. * * *
Unless present conditions ; undergo, a radical change
the question of the free coinage -of silver at 16 to 1
will not be a practical, living issue in the next cam
paign."
It will be seen Mr. Fleming believes he can reor
ganize and reinvigoratc Democracy by the simple act
of dismissing the silver question from the domain, of
politics. If that be all that is accomplished, how
ever, his reorganization will -not amount to much.
Bryanism means mo --e evils than free silver. The
Chicago platform, striking at the courts as well as at
the finances of. the nation, is a menace to almost the
whole fabric of society. Consequently if reorganiza
tion is to be the means of bringing back conserva
tive voters to the Democratic fold it must get rid not
enly of the silver <yaze but all that is expressed by the
word "Brvanism." including Bryan himself.
McLaurin thus far has not given out any definite
programme, of action. He is employing himself for
the present in preaching discontent against Bourbon
ism and all of its dogmas, from free trade to free sil
ver. He is appealing to the growing industrial spirit
ct the South and asking progressive and enterprising
myi to unite for the purpose of putting an end to the
ceaseless Southern agitation against protection and
sound money.
DEMOCRATIC REORGANIZATION.
BY way of employing the leisure of the season
several prominent Democrats in the Southern
States have "started movements"* toward the
reorganization of the Democratic party. The most
notable among them are Senator McLaurin of South
Carolina and Congressman Fleming of Georgia.
The first is a Democrat of such liberal tendencies that
he found it necessary for his peace of mind to have
his name removed/from the roll of the Democratic
caucus of the United States Senate, while the other
has been a IJryanite and is still a stalwart. So the
movement comes from both ends of the party and has
therefore features of general interest.
The people of Siberia are said to be suffering from
famine, but the Government is using^the cars of the
Siberian railway to ship men and military stores to
Manchuria, so there is no means of sending food tc
the sufferers. By and bv Americans will be asked to
contribute to the support of the Siberians, and when
the contributions are received the good Czar will give
us his imperial thanks. _

PRINCE OF MASSERANOâ S., City.
Prince Carlo Ferrero-Fieschi Masserano,
mentioned In Mark Twain's "Innocents
Abroad," and whose remains are at rest
in the Pere la Chaise Cemetery, was a
Spanish diplomat, who died in Paris.
France, in 1831. Le Grand rrtctionaire
says of him: "He was a captain of the
corps of the Flemish Guard, when in 1805
he wa3 named Embaasador to Paris by
Carlos IV. Three years later this ap
pointment was confirmed by Ferdinand
VII, but politicial complications did. not
permit of the acceptance of his creden
tials. After the forced abdication of his
sovereign, he felt constrained to live in
Paris, under police surveillance. In 1S09
he was appointed grand master of cere
monies to Joseph Napoleon, who became
King of Spain. He accepted the position
In order to save his fortune and estate,
but he continued to reside in Paris with
his family and ended his days there."

The plan would result in many benefits. It would
provide a means of putting money into circulation
through the banks of tbe large cities without showing
any favoritism, the distribution .would be general, and
there would be a considerable revenue to the Govern
ment from the interest on the deposits. There never
v.as a time when some improvement of the sort was
more needed than now, for at present the amount "of
money in the treasury is exceptionally large. The
subject is one that might well engage the attention of
business associations during the holidays so that when
Congress meets next rail there will be a resolute pub
lic sentiment to support the Secretary of the Treasury
in getting the law amended so that his plan may be
carried ot.t. ....
Secretary Gage has been among the foremost advo
cates of a better system. According to a recent sum
mary his plan is to deposit the money with the na
tional banks of all the larger cities of the country,
the banks to pay 2 per cent interest on the deposits.
The plan provides for to dividing the deposits as to
give each city a share in proportion to the ratio of its
reserves to the total reserves of the system, each bank
:n these cities to be given deposits on a correspond
ing basis. The Government's lien is to be first on ihÂ»
assets of each depository bank. The Secretary has
made a careful computation which shows that had this
plan been adopted thirty-six years ago there would
not have been a single dollar lost to the Government,
but, in fact, it would have made a profit of $32,000,000.
It is to the credit of cur national officials of both
parties that despite all sllegations of favoritism and
the investigations that have frequently been made con
cerning them there has never been a scandal devel
oped out of them. No official has ever been fonnd
guilty of making a profit out of the immense deposits
which the Secretary of the Treasury has the authority
to place in such banks as he chooses. That fact, how
ever, does not dispel the objections to the system,
and it is therefore gratifying that at the next session of
Congress an effort will be made to so amend the law
as to admit of a better system of getting money out
of the treasury into circulation.
THE TREASURY AND THE BANKS.
AT nearly all times the United States has in its
treasury a much larger sum of money than
there is any need for. It has been the custom
to distribute the surplus among the banks do that it
can get into circulation, prevent a monetary strin-
C^ncy and serve the people in the channels of trade.
That custom has never been satisfactory. It has in
v-iiiably given rise to charges of favoritism. When
Cleveland was in office l.is administration was chkrged
vith placing public funds in the hands of Democratic
bankers, and all Republican administrations have had
to meet similar charges of favoritism shown to Re
publican banks.
Any colored man who will"' follow^ those rules will
have no need of emigrating to Liberia or anywhere
else. With all it? faults America is still the best land
on earth for any man with thrift, energy and honesty.
The' colored man is an American citizen;, he is here
to stay, and should direct his thoughts and his efforts
toward improving his condition here and not else
where. ;V"
That some of them should have thought to find es
cape by emigration is not unnatural. .Fortunately
there are among them many leaders who have wiser
plans than that of the Atlanta organization. The
teachings and influence of Booker Washington have
borne fruit all over the South'. Not long ago a â¢com
mittee of colored men in New Orleans appointed, to
devise means for advancing the welfare of their race
reported a programme of action embodied in the fol
lowing rules: .
Fight the dives and dens and begin the fight for the
negro's moral elevation around the negro's own hearth
stone.
Help the authorities to sustain and enforce the laws
of the city and aid in the detection of crime and the pun
ishment of criminals.
Respect the lav/ and the officers of the, law, and quit
shielding negroes who are guilty of criminal offenses.
If an officer attempts to make an arrest, do not resist
or in any ; way interfere with him.
Stop looking upon a policeman as a common enemy.
Quit loafing around the'eorners.
Go to work for a living. -;;;â¢â¢;'''
From the promptings of that restlessness there will
of course come a struggle that will carry them up
ward and onward. All the great movements^ of hu
manity have been due to discontent^' and the more
restless^ the colored people of the South become the
more earnest will be their efforts to improve .their
conditions.
The chief interest in the incident lies in the signifi
cant light it throws upon the situation in the South.
The members of the Atlanta organization have no
complaints of poverty or of specific acts of ill treat
ment.- They are doing well in a material sense", are
steadily employed, are earning money, and, as ihe.
committee put it, "are making a living." (Their, de
sire to leave the country is due solely to an ambition
for something more than meat and drink and rai
n<ent. They long for a chance to raise their families
better, for a place where they can be free from race
prejudice, and where they are not subject 'to daily in
tercourse with a dominant society that looks down
upon them.
When properly considered it will be seen that ths
scheme of the Atlanta negroes, however impracticable
in itself, is* an encouraging sign. It is an evidence
that among the colored people there has been awak
ened an aspiration for a full and genuine freedom.
It is not now with them a mere question of running
for office, but of advancing themselves socially. They
have become restless under the existing order of
things, and, perceiving no way to better their condi
tion in any part of this country, are seeking to es
cape to another.
The scheme of the committee is of course an im
practicable one. Neither. Georgia nor any other State
in the Union has any money to promote the whole 1
sale emigration of any class of its population. Nor is
the scheme one that is likely to appeal to the public
at large and bring about any considerable contribu
tion of funds to aid the promoters in carrying it out.
It is doomed to failure.
Kliza Nunnally was the spokesman of the party and
she told the Governor all about the situation. There
were 500 or more negroes in Atlanta, she asserted, who
were anxious to go to Liberia, and these had appointed
the committee to see the Governor and ascertain what
could be done about it.- They had no special grievance,
she said, but they felt that It would never be possible for
the negroes to get-along well with the whites, and that
they could not raise their families as well here as If they
were separate and ,to themselves. They admitted that
they were making a living and gave no other reason for
their desire to go to Liberia. Eliza stated that about all
of the 500 negroes were middle-aged and had families,
and that none of them were young negroes.
pZJ IVE'HUNDRED negroes living in Atlanta are
I . â¢ eager to emigrate to Liberia, according to a re
port of the Atlanta Constitution. Our contem
porary states that a committee of colored people re
contly called upon the Governor and presented to him
a communication from their organization giving their
names and stating that 500 of them wish to go to
Liberia. They asked the Governor for advice and
for State aid.
In narrating the conference between the Governor
and the committee the Constitution says:

timidity with which women began intel
lectual association with one another, put
they are a simple confession that the
average woman joining the club felt tnai
she had no resources, no accumulated in
formation out of which a paper might oe
written or with which an impersonal con
versation might be garnished and sus
tained. One good, result of the club is
that It has sent women to the worm s
literature and has given them a purpose
in serious reading. It has also given them
opportunities for expression. It was a
rare woman who in the early club days
expressed her own ideas; not because it
was so rare that a woman had Ideas, but
In the ordinary relations of life such ideas
as she had upon any' but domestic sub
jects were carefully concealed. It was an
unwritten law that domestic harmony
and social courtesy demanded this.
Benefits of a Broader View.
One of the greatest advantages of the
club is that it has given women a new
opportunity to study human nature, the
Opportunity growing larger and more
varied as experience in club Hie ha3 led
women to be more natural and more spon
taneous in their discussions. The serious
reading and study induced by club mem
bership In no small measure has supple
mented early education* Club programmes
have become the but! of the "smart"
Journalist's ridicule, which has made it
ah old story that a woman's club will dis
patch in one afternoon several subjects,
any one of which would be considered a
matter for an investigation of months by
a learned man. It, must be borne in mind
that no club woman has ever claimed that
club membership made her "learned,"
and in emphasizing as one of the club's
advantages the freer play and the larger
neld^of contemplation which the club has
opened to woman's intelligence we make
no claim that the club 13 the equivalent
of the university.
The experience of associating with oth
ers not their Inferiors, not related to them
by ties of consanguinity or of the church,
and therefore not bound to flatter and to
coddle them, has had upon women an
effect the extent of which can hardly be
magnified. It is probable that the good
effects already presented measure about
all that the first decade of club life did
for the women who shared it. At the be
ginning of the second decade, when, by
their innocent pursuits, they had silenced
the light mockery with which they were
at first greeted, the club began yielding
its members another advantage: It gave
them some experience into which pleasure
enters in a much larger degree than It
enters Into the rivalries of ordinary so
ciety.
Courtesy and Intellectual Interchange
The second decade of club life Is marked
by the study of parliamentary law. The
endeavor to conduct clubs according to
parliamentary usage gave women a new
sense of order and decorum: taught them
that the primary object is not to differ
in opinion but to express differences in
an Inoffensive manner. This study of par
liamentary law often induced an undue
attention to "mint, anise and cummin''
and a forgetfulness of "weightier mat
ters," but the observance of parliamen
tary usage has had . one good effect In
that it has trained women to self-control
and to moderation and has compelled
them to pay outward respect to opponents.
I believe that women thus schooled do, on
the average, practice higher courtesy in
social life than women not thus trained,
since the Indispensable element of fine
courtesy is self-restraint.
The influence of the club upon its mem
bers has reacted upon the homes and upon
social life in general so that to a much
larger degree than formerly does social
life. demand some intellectual interchange,
some manifestation of spiritual activity.
Having learned to enjoy one another in
their clubs, women have increased this
pleasure by creating opportunities for
meeting this larger and more varied cir
cle of women outside of their clubs. To
a larsre extent the social functions made
by women for women only are the fruit
of club association. A good effect of ex
clusively feminine social life is that it has
rendered it as to manner, dress and sub
jects of conversation less Bervile to pre
conceived demands of men. It has culti
vated within women a desire to please
one another and a capacity for deriving
pleasure from social relations into which
coquetry does not enter.
Club Work of the Present Day.
The characteristic new feature of club
life in its third decade has been break-
Ing away from self-imposed limitations
that marked the Initial efforts of women
and the application of their garnered In
telligence and experience to the solution
of serious sociological problems and the
amelioration of social conditions.
A new interest in popular education, the
attempt to relate the home and the school,
to increase the sense of responsibility in
the former for the latter, the establish
ment of social relations between teach
ers and parents, the intelligent study and
public discussion of questions affecting
the public health may be enumerated
among the good effects of the club as
conducted at the present time.
Many of the principal clubs in the larger
cities from the beginning have been what
are called department clubs; In such clubs
the work has been carried on under the
direction of committees, and members
have been able- to be - registered in one or
another section according to their pref
erences. But while there was from the
beginning some opportunity for choice In
tlub work-in the larger clubs, in small
places this subdivision of the club into
sections is relatively recent. The study
of the semi-public/or wholly public ques
tions just enumerated has compelled wo
men to investigate the conditions of their
own community in these respects. Many
clubs now have their standing committees
on school visitation and on inspection of
public institutions; many clubs also ap
point special committees to report from
time to time, as need arises, the condi
tions of the odious quarters of a city.
Women's Larger View of Life.
Through this more practical study the
club In its third decade is relating woman
to the common life and quickening wo
man's conscience as to her duty toward
that \ life. This is perhaps the very best
effect upon women themselves that thÂ©
club has wrought. It implies all of the
other preceding good effects and is a
promise of results in whose benefits the
entire commonwealth will share. -All of
the good effects produced upon its mem
bers by the individual club are induced
in a correspondingly larger degree by
the General Federation of Women's
Clubs. It is only very recently that many
women have gone from their homes save
in pursuit of either pleasure or health; a
woman's journey from her home has al
ways meant either a visit to personal
friends or the temporary surrender to dis
sipation, more or less mild in its char
acter at some pleasure resort, or the
search for health by change of climate or
by being domiciled, 1 in a sanatorium.
The annual meetings of the State feder
ation, the biennials of the general federa
tion, with their intermediate gatherings of
committees, have all contributed their
share in giving to woman a larger sense
of State and national life and a keener
perception of their relation to both.
â¢ Thus briefly I have suggested the direc
tions in which the woman's club, by its
good effects upin its members, has proved
its right to a place among our social insti
tutions. I reserve to a later date a discus
sion of what to my mind are the distinctly
bad effects upon women of club life.

: On. March 18- last Sorosis celebrated
Its thirty-first anniversary. Called the
"mother, of clubs," Sorosis has not yet
attained an 1 age which makes a woman

Only at' the | hither verge of her later

tive, for art ample discussion of this sub
ject.*' In less than a generation, as. gen
erations are counted, many generations
of women, as we count generations in
the development of individual life, have
gone into clubs.
At the present time there are -within
the General Federation "of Women's Clubs
about 2000 clubs. A large majority of
clubs, however, are still outside of the
federation. It is probable, there
fore, that a moderate estimate of this
form of organization permits us to" say
that in the United States there are be
tween 8000 and 12,000 women's clubs, in
cluding a membership of about 300,000 wo
men.
Before the Era of Women's Clubs.
How the club has reacted upon its mem
bers and upon general society is an inter
esting inquiry. I shall give my first at
tention to the favorable effects of cluD
life. There is hardly a. better method
than the one pursued by the venders 01
patent' medicines, who show the contrast
of "before and after taking." Before and
after? Thirty years ago the average wo
man of the class from which clubs draw
the majority of their members recognized
only three proper avenues for the move
ment of her life.' r>omestic duty, social
pleasure, the church and the charities ana
philanthropies clustering about the churcn
and entering in it, measured the accepted
boundaries of the activties of the aver
age woman. Such women, for the most
part,' met as eauals only the members or
their own church or their own social set.
Outside of these circles women associated
habitually with their inferiors in age or
in position, namely, with their children or
their servants. , Â¦ * j ,
The shrewd observers of America prior
to ths club era -unite in their recognt
tion of the limited and the local intelli
gence of the average American woman.
Harriet Martineau, Frederika Bremer,
Mrs. Trollope and Frances Wright are
the four women who, after having en
joyed abundant opportunities for study
ing American life, publicly and frankly
expressed their opinions of it. These four
women, only two of them of the same
nationality and no two of them of trie
same temperament and mental naDits,
were of one accord in deploring the ae
gree to which the attention of American
women was monopolized by petty cares
and petty pleasures. Mrs. Trollope t ouna
them restricted and vulgarized by tne
personal nature of all of their interests.
Frederika Bremer gently regretted the lit
tle attention given by them to art or to
the amenities of general social life. Fran
ces Wright found that the minds of wo
men who had themselves personally con
tended with pioneer conditions had been
opened and broadened by this contact with
facts and with conditions which consti
tuted an unending series of emergencies
and made upon the wits of all -n omen a,
draft to which even the dullest made some
response. Harriet Martineau found Amer,

sion like most human' contrivances, has
bcÂ° n accompanied by both advantages and
disadvantages. In this i article only tne
advantages will be noted. - The fact tnat
tb. exclusion was made a serious condi
tion bv the clubs earliest organized, Inti
mates the timidity with which women en-
S.red into thTclub relation They sought
harmonious relations with * lar ?f t r h f LI Â£
more varied cime than they had hitherto
known. To secure harmony they felt
theV must banish subjects upon which
opinions naturally would differ, beca use
to their minds to differ was to clwh to
clash was to experience a sense of dis
courtesy, of wrong, o'.^ffnteient. The
mere fact that women instinctively felt it
necessary to limit their discussions to sub
jects upon which they could not widely
di-a^ree that hey might maintain peace,
is the best possible proof of the degree to
which custom had limited their horizon
narrowed their prejudice and reduced
their vision. The origin of many clubs
is an interesting story. The chronicles of
women's clubs, even the meager records
of club secretaries, will be valuable fpr
students of sociology and historians, yet
even these chronicles will be less valu
able than they might have been because
the same timidity which feared the Intro
duction of questions that might occasion
difference of opinion and consequent dlsÂ»
pute. also voted it discourteous to retain
on the records any discussions which dis
tinctly reveal a 'troubled mood.
How Women Found One Another Out.
The immediate occasion of the birth of
Sorosis was the decision of the New York
Press Club to exclude its one or two
women members from the banquet with
which Charles Dickens was to be wel
comed on the occasion of his first visit to
this country. Not every club can quote
so interesting an ante-natal incident, but
every club will find at the very root of its
origin a multitude of half-confessed or en
tirely concealed local causes and every
club Includes at least one member with
some sense of humor who is ready to
transmit the traditions of divers incidents
showing a tendency toward touchiness,
Â¦which is only an expression of the petti
ness that was a marked characteristic of
the ante-club woman. . .
The club discovered to women that other
women not belonging to their church and
whose husbands belonged to the opposing
political party were not less agreeable and
not less trustworthy than themselves. In
this initial discovery may be found the
first stupendous good effect- of the club
upon club women. The habit of meeting
with women outside Of their own particu
lar set who could not be interested in the
discussion of the same social incidents
forced them to prepare themselves by
study to discuss questions that were other
than personal and local and . sectarian.
As there must be a common basis for all
happy social intercouse, and as some com
mon 'knowledge and some common inter
est must constitute such a basis, the club
set women to studying the same books ,
that they might talk about them. It is
generally supposed that the most innocu
ous of books are of the purely remote his
torical type. Club programmes show that
a large majority of women's clubs began
their careers. by -laborious papers and con
versations upon' subjects drawn from the
history of Egypt or Asia Minor or Greece
or else they studied pure belles-lettres.
While no club exactly duplicates the ex
perience of any other, : I think that club
women all over the country would dis- >
cover relatively the same evolutionary !
stages in the clubs to which they belong !

The.next meeting of the same club I
shows that its members were occupied in I

On March 15 of -the present year the same
club was considering John Ruskin. My
inference that the majority of eluba at
the outset have found refuge in antiquity
and have gradually developed themselves
into becoming : contemporary with them

principle can be killed by killing the one who gives
it expression. So the Cossacks kill and the. prisons
burst with victims to give life to Holy Russia and
safety to the Czar.
To guard against a future outbreak of intelligence
it is further proposed to put such restrictions upon
university education as shall render it worthless. This
purpose is to be effected by giving university degrees
to those who ?pply under proper conditions without
examination and without the receiver having taken
the courses required for the degree he receives.
But Russian autocracy is not made of such stuff.
Its oriental feature is from the old Orient, whence
The remedy proposed is peculiarly that of a be
sotted tyranny.' An intelligent ruler, seeing his dy
nasty threatened by 'a 'revolt against a policy of re
pression, would examine and relax that policy. He
would bring to his side the intelligence of his empire
by enfranchising the. minds of his people. He would
save his dynasty from overthrow and his country from
decay at one stroke.
Not so with the educated and enlightened classes.
Their loyalty to their race and country revolts at the
repression of the manhood of the one and. the moral
decay of the other. Education makes them aspire.
They would utilize the splendid capacity and virility
of the Russian character before it has been quenched
and yields no spark of fire under the blows of sodden
autocracy. But in Russia loyalty must run to the
small personality of the Czar,. not to the transcendent
figure of the state. So in the realization of loyalty to
country these scholars and thinkers are guilty of trea
son to the Czar. In their last uprising the moujik has
moved uneasily in his sleep. A forgotten thrill of man
hood has run along his nerves. As in a vision he has
seemed to see himself disenthralled, standing upright
with his forehead to the stars, a man among men. So
here and there this class has added its brawn to the
brains of the scholars, and with sticks and stones has
met the. awful whips and keen swords of the Cossack
troops. .True, they ars ridden down and tramped to
death by the horses of the Don, but their act has made
the Czar tremble. He' sees the muscle of his empire
responding to its mind, and is afraid.
Â¦"Tâ HE folly" of Russian policy receives fresh illus-
I > tration. Recently Tolstoi had occasion. to re
â¢: *>- monstrate against' a conspicuous act of senile
tyranny. A considerable number of Russians had mi
grated to this continent, leavingÂ»their wives to follow
when provision had been made to receive them. That
having been done the women were sent for, but Rus
sia forbade them leaving the empire. It is difficult to
be patient with such an exhibition of the wanton use
of power. A Government guilty of it is not entitled
to the loyalty of ' its people nor the respect of the
world. In all the real revolutionary movements in
Russia, which have been public and open, the leaders
and followers have been university students and pro
fessors and the educated and thinking classes. As a
rule the moujik has taken his lot as a matter of
course and has been content to look worshipfully
ttpon the Czar and. gnaw his black crust.

Chief Elton also inclosed a list of
jewelry found in the possession of Gor
delli when arrested. Mrs. Espinoza called
at the office of Captain Seymour yesterday
afternoon and the captain went through
the list with her. AH the articles be
longed to her and were stolen by the
wornan. There are only a few articles
missing and it is probable that they have
been, sold by the pair. The coin, of
course, has gone glimmering.
Captain Seymour is Inclined to believe
that the robbery at the Espinosa resi
dence was the only one committed by the
Woman in this city, as no other com
plaints have been received by him of the
kind. Nothing is known of the past rec
ord of the couple here and Chief Elton
writes that they are reticent as to their
past life and refuse to talk. The woman
is about 23 years of age and of prepossess
ing appearance. Her complexion i8 very
dark her hair "black and she has rosy
cheeks and an innocent air. She speaks
Spanish fluently. She and Gordelli lived
together for a short time as man and wife
in the Lombard! Hotel on Broadway, near
Sansome street, where they took the plun
der stolen from Mrs. Espinoza, but de
camped before the detectives got there.
Captain Seymour received a letter yes
terday from Chief Elton of Los Angeles,
inclosing photographs of the woman and
the man arrested there for stealing $800
worth of jewelry from the house of Morita
Meyberg, where the woman was employed
as a domestic for a few days. The
woman gave her name there as Julia
Carpi and the man as Alfred Gatia, but
yesterday Mrs. Catharine Espinoza, 2400
Harrison street, Identified the photograph
of the woman as that of Julia Gonzaleski,
who was employed by her for a few weeks
as a domestic and absconded on March 21
with more than $1000 worth of jewelry and
$450 in coin. The photograph of the man
was identified as that of Francisco Gor
delli, the woman's companion here. Mrs.
Espinoza swore to a warrant for their ar
rest Monday on the charge of grand lar
ceny and if they cannot be convicted, in
Los Angeles they will be brought back
here and tried.

BIG MINING SUIT IN
THE CIRCUIT COURT
Grass Valley Gold Producers B-epre
ssnted by Notable Legal Talent
in the Trial.
A notable array of legal talent was pres
ent yesterday morning In the United
States Circuit Court, the occasion being
the trial of the suit of the Penn Consoli
dated Mining Company ; vs. The Grass
Valley Exploration Company. The plain
tiff was represented by Curtis H. Lindley,
H. Eickhoff, Frederick Searls and G. W.
Kitts, and the defendant by Garber, Cres
well & Garber and P. F. Simonds. * -
The suit was brought to recover $G00,000
damages and restitution of property, the
plaintiff alleging that the defendant took
out of one of its veins gold ore of- that
value within the last two years. There Is
another suit pending In which the parties
are reversed, the Grass Valley Explora
tion Company being the plaintiff, and
asking for $100,000 damages and the eject
ment of the Penn Consolidated miners.
Mr. Lindley made the opening state
ment, occupying two hours in explaining
by mean3 of maps and diagrams what he
intended to prove. The issue in the case
Is whether certain gold-bearing veins out
side the surface boundaries of the Penn
Consolidated and tapped by the defendant
in one of its mine shafts have their apices
within the surface boundary lines of the
Penn Consolidated.
The mines are situated at the town of
Grass 'Valley. The trial will be resumed
this mornlnjr.

Mr. Woodworth's reply 'will be for
warded to-day. It will consist merely of
a statement of the legal procedure to be
adopted and of the steps already taken in
the way of proof.
United States Attorney, San Francisco, Cal.:
"What have you done on Instructions concern
lnK slave traffic in Chinese girls? I desire
full and prompt co-operation with State au
thorities In all v/ays which law authorizes.
HOYT, Acting Attorney General.
United States Attorney Woodworth said
yesterday that no steps toward arrests
would be made until (sufficient evidence
should have been sceured to justify con
victions. There is a company and a
lawyer behind every Chinaman and slaves
or other property will not bo given up
withcut a legal struggle.
The Attorney General of the United
States thinks it is an easy stunt to arrest
and convict the Chinese inmates of dis
reputable houses, as is shown by the fol
lowing dipatch, received yesterday morn
ing by Mr. Woodworth: ,
The first point to which Mr. Woodworth
has turned his attention is whether there
are any persons in this district held in
slavery. After the individual slaves shall
have" been found the next point will be the
evidence to convict the persons holding
them in slavery. On these propositions
Miss Cameron of the Presbyterian Chinese
Mission. Miss Lake of the Methodist Chi
nese Mission and Dr. John Endicott Gar
diner, Chinese Inspector, have furnished
considerable evidence.
United States Attorney Marshall B.
Woodworth has been quietly gathering
evidence for the past three weeks respect
ing the existence of Chinese girl slavery
in the Northern District of California.
He has taken the best legal advice. Includ
ing that of United States Circuit Judge
W. W. Morrow, as to the mode of pro
cedure to be adopted and as to the kind
of proof to be secured in- order to warrant
convictions, for he is well aware that in
discriminate and hastily advised arrests
would result in the discharge of the ar
rested pers&ns and would turn the efforts
of the Federal authorities into a farce.

THE members of the California
Club were gladdened yesterday by
a large attendance at the Indus
trial and Allied Arts Exhibition at
Mechanics' Pavilion, the celebra
tion of "President's day" serving to at
tract visitors.
Mrs. Lovell White, president of the
club, and Mr-s. A. D. Sharon, vice-presi
dent, were In charge for the day, and
supplied two delightful musical pro
grammes for the afternoon and evening.
Kampe succeeded in getting himself
elected president, director, secretary and
treasurer of the company. The property
of the corporation consisted of sixty-four
claims, which are said by members of the
company who have seen them to be of
considerable value. Kampe then got the
stockholders to give him an option on
$180,000 worth of the property, which he
was to develop, at his own. expense, for
his own personal benefit, according to
their allegations. â¢Â¦
By virtue of his many offices, his con
fidence-inspiring manner and an explana
tion that while he was in Alaska he
might have to call an assessment or
might sell the property and would need
the stock to turn it over toUhe possible
purchaser, Kampe induced . the stock
holders to intrust every share of the com
pany to himself. In lieu of a receipt they
adopted a resolution accepting Kampe s
guarantee. He developed the claims, but
finding that there was no profit in them,
it is alleged, he decided that the investi
gation of the property had been conducted
in behalf of the Independent Mining Com
panv and levied a $10,000 assessment ac
cordingly.
Meanwhile he sold the property on
which he had the $180,000 option for $240,
000. The purchaser paid $10,000, and think
ing the deal would soon be- completed,
Kampe decided that he was developing
the property on his own account again.
The prospective purchaser did not com
plete the deal, but forced Kampe to re
turn tho $10,000. As a result of this affair
Kampe decided that the company had
been conducting the development opera
tions after all.
President, Secretary, Treasurer and Di
rector Kampe recently returned to this
city and informed the eager stockholders
that he had developed the property at a
cost of $10,000 on behalf of the company
and that there were no returns. To in
sure his position, Kampe still holds the
stock. The stockholders remember very
plainly that Kampe was to develop this
property, on which they had given him an
option, and at his own expense. To re
cover this $10,000 the suit is filed.
The plaintiffs, who own about 80,000
shares of stock, are R. W. Schultze,
Maurice Enright, T. Olsen; "W. J. McDon
ald, A. Petry. C. Juhl, A. H. Schultze, E.
F. Schumacher, H. Mein, C. F. Rydell, W.
P. Schultze, A. Richter, W. Falkenberg,
Eliza Schultze, A. Peterson, A. R. Peter
son, Charles Lutjen and W. C. Jensen.
The remaining 20,000 shares are owned by
Kampe and his friends. The board of
directors, named as defendants in the
suit, are Solomon Kampe, D. J. Welsh, J.
H. Ryan, Henry Ingerson, A. Richter and
John Doe.
Solomon Kampe, one-time money lender
and later mining promoter, is the prin
cipar defendant in a suit for $10,000. filed
by various stockholders of the Independ

shares -of the company's stock, out of
which they believe themselves t& have
been defrauded. The company was formed
In the fall of 18S9 for the purpose of de
veloping mining property, in the vicinity

Tulare County.
Young Wiikie left Glasgow on June
28, and arrived at Tulare August
4, or nearly three weeks after he
ought to have reached his desti
nation, lie inquired of the Southern Pa
cific seent how to reach Boulder Spring
and was directed to go via Visalia. though
he Phould have been sent via Exeter, from
vhich nlace a daily staÂ«?e runs to Three
Rivcre, which is fourteen miles from
Boulder Spring-, the lad's destination. The
boy wer.t to Visalia that same day and
four days later either he or Some one
else holding his baggage checks called at
the office and got the baggage. Nothing
farther is known of young- Wilkie's move
in en t p.
The equipment furnished the boy by his
father is typical of the outfit given young
Britishers who r.re ppnt out to rough It
for a t!mo on some Western ranch. Be
r'o'es a liberal supply of clothing- .end
seme JkioIcp, tho following- articles were
packed in a box: A double-barreled
breach-loading gun, with "Boulder Spring"
trgraved on the stock; two spring sheath
knives, a large hunting knife and sheath,
?Tgravcd "Boulder Spring-"; a field glass,
lifty cartridges and reloading tools.
McCaskills ranch at BouUler Spring is
fourteen miles from Three Rivere and
filly from Visalia. so that his search for
hi? nephew's son has been attended with
rr.uch difficulty. He ha* a theory that
f me one. influenced by the standing offer
that is made during the fruit picking sea
son, of a money reward for each laborer
brought in. induced the boy to turn aside
i:i tho fce'.itf that he could do better than
to en to his uncle's ranch. McCasklll is
oonvincc-o that his young relative met
v;th foul play, else he would have been
hmrd from before this.
Th^ box which contained the outfit was
marked in larce letters In paint. "Ken
neth Wilkie, Boulder Spring, Three Riv
ers, Tulare County, California." It was
larg-e and conspicuous, and the failure of
t*e local r>eace and railroad officials to
get an:- information as to what became
of It after it was taken from the office
at Visalia throws a greater air of mystery
aV>out the case.
V>*ilkie is 16 years of age and S feet 7
inches in height. He had not been away
from home before and was ignorant of
travel and the ways of the world.

Fried Foods
â such as fried oysters, doughnuts, fish,
potatoes, etc. â don't always "sit well" in
some stomachs. "Too rich." they de-
clare; "don't agree with me." Why?
Nine times out of ten because they have
been fried in lard, and what was charged

Send for a pail of

and use that for shortening and frying.
There will be no more complaints of

White Cottolene is an old friend in

NEW YORK, April 16.â A firm opening, with
prices 5@10 points higher, resulted from an
unexpected show of strength abroad. The July
position was relatively the firmest option on
the list, while May, except at the opening, was
the first to give way to liquidation on room

v
NEW YORK. April 16.â The downward course
of lead In London' was unabated to-day, prices
having further declined 3s 9d to Â£12 2s 6d,
touching the lowest figures in years. The
principal cause attributed to the weakness Is
heavy shipments from this country; New York
alone shipped 4200 tons abroad since the 1st of
April. Lead In local circles, however, remains
inactive ' and unchanged at $4 37%. There was
a sympathetic rise of about 15 points on bid
figures for tin to-day as prices took another
move upward In London. Trading, nevertheless,
was very slow and our market closed firm but
quiet at $26@26 50. At London the close was
firm at Â£117 27s 6d for spot and Â£114 5s for
futures. Although a steady undertone was
prevalent in' copper prices were more or less
nominal, owing to the absence of business,
with the closing basis at $17 .for Lake Superior
and $16 62% for casting. ) In London an ad
vance of 10s was noted, making spot Â£70 17s 6d
and futures Â£71. 10s. Spelter ruled quiet and
about steady at $3 9O@3 95. Domestic iron
markets were Â¦without Important features, but
continue steady. Glasgow warrants closed

NEW YORK, April 16.â The stock market
gave evidence to-day that the speculation still
retains an abundant vitality, 'but nevertheless
the tone was exceedingly feverish and at times
very nervous. An opportunity was given dur
ing the morning to see the unwisdom of the
speculative'leaders in having attempted to sub
stitute a lot of low-grade_ industrial stocks ;
for the high-grade rallroads~as leaders the I
market. The violent relapses from yesterday's
manipulated advances in some of these stocks
caused considerable disorder in the market dur
ing the early trading. The decided weakness
of the United States Steel stocks on account Â¦
of the reported threat ot the president of the
Amalgamated Association to precipitate a
strike had an unsettling effect all through the
industrial list. It was proved once again that
the industrial stocks are influenced by such (
variety of causes and conditions that it is
hopeless to expect any uniform movement in
all of them. All high-priced Industrials con
tinued to show strength, notably Sugar and
Amalgamated Copper. The dealings in the lat
ter stock were on an enormous scale and the
price movement violent and erratic. After the
opening bulge realizing carried the price %
point below last night. Later in the day, after
the publication of tha proposition for absorb
ing the Butte and Boston and Boston and Mon
tana the stock was run up 4% from the lowest
to 12S%. The last price was 125%â a net gain
of only %. The general market proved rather
Indifferent to the movement of the specialties ,
and there was a general declining tendency,
Rock Island especially falling 3% under last
night and a large number of prominent rail
road stocks from 1 to 2 points. With the re
vival of rumors that the Burlington plan of
merger would certainly be published to-mor
row that stock. Northern Pacific and the Eries
became extraordinarily buoyant again and
there was a sympathetic recovery in the gen
eral market. The Kaunas and Texas stocks
were another center of strength. In this move
ment Burlington touched 195, a recovery from
the lowest of 7%. and Northern Pacific, selling
ex-divldend of 1 per cent, rose by violent ad
vances to 105% â an extreme advance of 7%.
The Erie stocks rose from 2 to 3 points. The
prices of all of these stocks except Erie second
preferred made new high records to-day. Not
withstanding the sympathetic recoveries In the
general market it will be seen that the day's
net changes are as a rule of Insignificant di
mensions. The gains by the banks from the
6ub-treasury, owing to the high level of pen
sion payments and the buying of bonds by the
Secretary of the Treasury, afford unquestion
able relief to the money market. The rise In
Chicago exchange to 10c premium also reflects
the turning point in the interior currency
movement in favor of New York? But the sig
nificant fact in the day's money market was
the quick response of the sterling exchange
market to the easier money conditions here,
giving grounds for the conjecture that any in
crease In the available supply of funds in New
York will go to London for the purpose of the
coming issue of consols. It is Important to
rememj>er that this government loan, which
is estimated at $250,000,000 as a minimum, is in
excess of any loan since the French Indemnity
to Germany. The London money market is at
present not only heavily indebted to the Bank
of England, but the amount of French and
American capital at interest In London is of
unprecedented volume. London's solicitude
over the foreign exchange is thus easily ex
plicable. The constant growth of the trade
balance indicates the increase of this country's
capital resources for investment. But it is
obvious that the placing of the investment is
purely a question of relative Interest rates.
The extraordinary financial operations in pro
gress in New York were again reflected to
day In the clearing-house exchanges, Â¦which
reached the astounding aggregate of $445,241,
223. compared with tha previous record daily
clearing of $437,852,980 on one day of last week.
Operations in connection with the United States
Steel Company's finances are supposed to ac
count for these figruree.
The bond market became irregular to-day on
realizing in speculative issues. Total sales,
par value, $3,200,000.
United States refunding 2s declined % and
new 4s advanced hi. per cent on the last call:

Chicago opened firm and a shade higher, with
a light demand, mostly speculative. The local
longs were fair buyers. A better, shipping and
milling demand was , reported for the low
grades. The weather for the next three or
l(-ur weeks is likely to be a factor. Brad
street's estimate gave an increase east of the
Kockies of 3,912,000 bushels, and a decrease
ufioat and in Europe of 800,000. leaving a total
decrease of 3,112,000 bushels. Toward the close
the crowd got afraid of carrying their wheat
over night and began to unload.

Weather Report
Los Angeles summaryâ Frost damage last
week Â¦was not general : apricots, walnuts and
vegetables were injured in some "localities, in
others not. Apricots are practically a failure;
peaches promise well. Haying. Is In progress;
early sown, good crop: late sown, drying up.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAâ Nearly normal
temperature has prevailed during the week.
Xo eevere frosts have occurred and no rain
has fallen, except a light shower in San Diego
County. Early sown grain continues in good
condition, but the later 6own must have rain
eoon to insure a crop. Haying is in progress in
some sections: the yield of hay will be heavy.
Apricots were seriously damaged by froets dur
ing the preceding week in Santa Barbara
County and other places, are on mar
ket In Ran Diego.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEYâ Generally clear
weather, with warm days and cool nights ac
companied by dry northerly wind, has pre
vailed during the past week. Frosts occurred
Qurte often during the early part of the week,
ceverely damaging almonds and apricots anl
in some sections vines. Peaches were damaged
considerably in some localities, but a fair crop
If expected. Other fruits were but slightly
da.maged. Rain Is badly needed In all sections.
The ground is generally too dry for the culti
vation of orchards and vineyards. Early sown
p-ain continues to look well in most sections,
but the late sown is generally suffering for
rain. Grain is heading out in some places.
Haying will commence next week and a good
crop is expected. Alfalfa is doing well. Stock
of all kinds is healthy and in good condition.
Green feed continues plentiful.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS-The tempera
ture has been above normal during the week
and no severe frosts have occurred since the
9ih. The continuance of dry winds and absence
of rain are seriously affecting crops in some
sections. Early wheat is in good condition,
but the late sown and pasturage need rain
very soon. Barley is heading out. The hay
crop will be heavy. Deciduous fruits were
considerably injured by frosts during thepre
ceaing week, although some sections report
that the Ices will be very light. Apricots,
peaches and almonds appear to have been most
fcerlously affected, but in places prunes, grapes
and walnuts were greatly damaged. The or
chards on high lands suffered lees than those
on the lower lands.
SACRAMENTO VALLEYâ The weather has
been wanner than during the preceding weetc
and no severe frosts have been reported since
last Mor.day. Dry northerly winds have pre
vailed, and- as no rain has fallen during the
week the soil has become very dry. Late re
ports from the fruit districts state that while
considerable damage resulted from the frosts
of last week, the loss will not be as heavy
as then estimated. In portions of Placer
County there was no injury to fruit, and the
orchards on the -Sacramento and American
rivers were not seriously damaged. Good crops
are expected in those sections. The first
strawberries from Placer County and the first
cherries from Sola no County were shipped on
the 11th. Grain is still In fair condition, but
rain is needed.
The severe frosts of the preceding week,
though less injurious than at that time esti
mated, damaged all varieties of deciduous
fruits materially, especially in the central and
northern portions of the State. Some favored
localities escaped serious injury, but from
nearly all sections the reports continue very
discouraging. In some places it Is said the
apricot crop will be a failure, and peaches,
prunes, grapes and other fruits will yield a
very light crop. The first shipments of early
cherries and strawberries were made from the
Sacramento Valley during the week. Oranges
and calves were not injured by frost.
The temperature has been considerably high
er than during the preceding week and no in
jurious frosts ha\-Â« occurred since Tuesday
morning. With the exception of a light shower
in the vicinity of San Diego, no rain has fallen
during the week. Dry northerly winds have
continued in most sections. Fogs along the
coast have been beneficial to crops.
GENERAL SUMMARY,
The report of A. G. McAdie, section director
of the climate and crop section of the Weather
Bureau, for the week ending Monday. Is as
follows:
The Weather and Crops.
"There is a better feeling In apricots, due
largely to the recent buying: but quotations
are practically as they have been. Figs are
in rood demand and firm; dates quiet; apples
very dull; sun-dried apples are lower and
easy." ,
â¢â¢The extreme weakness of the raisin market
led to some speculative buying yesterday of
California London layers. A well-known Job
ling house, which has been prominent of late
as a rather heavy buyer of apricots, purchased
4300 boxes of 3-crown layers from a local
holder, this transaction practically giving the
buyer, it Is understood, control of the bulk of
these goods on the sr-ot. The price was not
Biven out, but undoubtedly was considerably
under the market. The new holder asks $1 40.
"The cut of 2c on seeded raisins by the asso
ciation has affected the spot market for all
sorts of raisins, but the market is still so un
cetlted and there is so complete a lack of de
mand that it is practically impossible to quote
the actual market at the moment. California
loose Muscatels, however, can be bought with
out difficulty at 5%c for 2-crown, 5%c for i
crown and 6c for 4-crown, and very likely less
morey would be accepted.
"Demoralized conditions prevail at practically
all points in prunes and raisins. Excitement
quoted down somewhat yesterday, but general
conditions were about the same as on Wednes
day. The New York trade still gives little
evidence of any disposition to buy to any
extent either prunes or seeded raisins from
California at the reduced prices, while holders
of spot stocks, particularly raisins, are willing
to sell at almost any price at which they can
find a buyer. The spot situation on prunes is
a little better than on raisins, for the simple
reason that stocks are light. What trade is
doing is at i4@^c under prices at which sales
were made before the cut on the coast.
Latest mail advices from New York say
Fruit and Salmon in London.
The London Grocers' Gazette of March 30
Â¦aye:
"The market for salmon is without anima
tion, but prices ke*Â» steady, and with -more
suitable weather after the holidays & brisker
business is anticipated. The Etrathdon and
Alsternixe are both reported off the coast and
may be expected in at London shortly. The
former brings 55,000 cases and the latter 91,000
cares of Alaska.. The heavy quantities of
California fruit which have been arriving in
this country are to be further augmented by
the arrival of the Strathdcn with 35,000 cases
i.nd the Alstemixe vith 44.000* cases. 'While
the recent arrivals have practically all been
taken off the quays, resales have only beej
possible at prices considerably lower than those
originally paid by the sellers. In fact busi
ness has only been possible at a smart reduc
tion in prices."

CHICAGO, April 16.â During the first two
hours the wheat market looked strong. The
weather maintained a seasonable perfection
and receipts were liberal it spring wheat
points, but on the other hand was a collection
of considerations mora potent, at least early,
when the " market advanced %c. Liverpool
showed appreciation of the advance here yes
terday and with this in mind opening bids
were from J / B c to %c improved for May, which
changed hands from 70%@71c. Bears hazarded
small lots and forced the market to 70%c a few
minutes later. The strength of the coarser
grains made itself felt afthls juncture, how
ever, and the bears ceased their operations and
covered later as addad incentives for so doing
were felt. Among these bullish Items were -a
report from Oklahoma that the crop of that
territory had been damaged 23 per cent by fly,
liberal seaboard clearances, a heavy visible
decrease and a prediction of frost for Kansas.
May rallied and advanced slowly to 71%c dur
ing the forenoon. The market was not strong
on the bulge, however, and when longs at
tempted to secure profits the price dropped
sharply to 70%<S7C%c. The close a moment
later found May %c under yesterday at 70%c.
Moderate â¢ activity and a considerable degree
of strength, due 10 unfavorable . seeding
weather, characterized the corn market. May
clcstd %c higher at 44%c.
Oats were active and strong. May closed %c
higher at 25%c. . '
Provisions were quiet and easier, Influenced
by increasing hoe receipts and lower prices
for them. July pork ciosed 10c lower; lard,
12%c down and ribs 20c depressed. â¢
The leading futures ranged as follows:

and "A for the end of June, but this stock
relapsed later with the rest of the American

shares were stagnant, dragging down to the
very close of the day that was featureless.
There was some talk of active money in New

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
When . the case was called Attorney
Herman J. Custer. representing Coburn,
whom even the mandate of a subpoena
had failed to bring to court, asked for &
continuance for four weeks, "that he
might procure depositions from the East."
Attorney Matt Sullivan, representing
Mrs. Ella F. Murray, decedent's daughter,
objected to a continuance. The request
for a continuance was denied, and Cuatej
was called upon to furnish his proof. He
had none, and hence the order denying
the petition was entered on the ground
The "denial of Coburn's petition practi
cally frees the estate from litigation. The
greater portion of the estate, which 13
valued at $600,000. has already, been dis
tributed to Mrs. Murray by Judge Troutt.
only the sum of $25,000 being withheld to
pay any debts against the estate which
may hereafter be approved by the court.
Sullivan & Sullivan have represented Mra.
Murray, and within less than a year have
practically closed up the estate, a record
for quick work seldom equaled in a Cali
fornia court.
Joseph M. Cofcurn failed to appear in
Judge Troutt's court yesterday morning
to offer proofs in support of his petition
for the probate of a "last will" of the
late Mrs. Almira S. Townsend. In con
sequence the court denied the petition on
the eround that it was a sham and fraud.

Miss Alice Dunn and Alfred J. Kelleher.
It was a pleasing and well arranged enter
tainment. Miss La Barraque is blind, but
notwithstanding this obstacle to her musi
cal progress she gave evidence of con
scientious study and of sensibilitv, which
is the soul of all real music. She sang
two songs, "Without Tnee," by D'Harde
lot, and "When the Heart Is Young," by
Dudley Buck: a number from. "Der
Frelschutz." an Alpine melody by Weker
lln, and Gounod's "Ave Maria." In -the
last number she was accompanied by Mr.
Wismer, Mr. Kelleher and Miss Dunn. In
this variety of selections her voice was
exhibited to srood advantage. She was
thrice recalled and her performaneo
caused much enthusiasm. Miss Dunn was
a clever and pleasing accompanist and
added much to the excellence of the enter
tainment.
Mr. Wismer and Mr. Maurer performed
with fine finish two movements of a suite
in A major by Goldmark. and a Spohr
adagio, E flat. op. 145. Mr. Sherin sang
"Beyond the Gates of Paradise" and
"The Indifferent Mariner." Messrs Wis
mer and Sherin were both recalled. The
audience was quite large and tho affair
may be set down as a success in all re
spects.

Speaks to Large Audience on "Soldier
Spirit" and "Success in-
Life."
An interesting address was delivered by
J. C. Stubbs, third vice president of the
Southern Pacific Company, at the parlors
of the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church . on Mission street last night.
A laree audience of both sexes
was \present and listened to the
address with marked Interest. Mr.
Stubbs reviewed the events of the
civil war and the late conflict with Spain,
and dwelt upon the x "soldier spirit" , dis
played by the citizens of America. He
claimed that this spirit was shown in all
walks of life and that it was displayed,
not for the hope of future promotion or
reward, but 'for self-pride and conscience.
Mr. Stubbs said that all great men of
history had won their fame unselfishly.
He eulogized Grant, Lincoln. Garfleld and
President McKinley and begged the young
men of to-day to follow in the footsteps
of the heroes of America. Â«,.'.,_
"Success in life." said Mr. Stubbs.
"means the doing of ordinary things in
an extremely Â«well manner. Success is
not the doing of great things. A steady
and constant striving to overcome the ob
stacles of the day will lead to success in
life and happiness." :

o'clock this forenoon in the Senate cham

Thomas Ross. Mayor George H. Clark,
who was ill, sent Colonel H. \yeinstock to
deliver an address of welcome.
Dr. "'Ross In his annual address spoke
of the progress in surgery and medipine
in the past twenty -five' years, giving fig
ures to show the gain which has been
made through modern .investigation 'and
discovery. Dr. J. A. McKee, president oi
the Sacramento Society for Medical Im

come on behalf of his society. Dr. "Wil

tee of arrangements, also bade the phy
sicians welcome.
The afternoon session of the State Med
ical Society opened v/ith a, discussion on
bubonic plague, a payer being read by Dr.
David Powell ' of Marysville, who gave
something of the history of the disease.
Dr.H. D. Lawhead of Woodland followed
with* a paper entitled "A review of the
chemical features rÂ«nd treatment of the
plague," which was largely technical.
A paper was ready by Dr. *W. H. Kel
logg, bacterioloffist of the Board of
Health of San-Francisco, on "The Pathol
ogy'iind Bacteriology, of Bubonic Plague."
tne paper described minutely the plague
bacilli, which Dr. Kellogg claimed were
much better known and understood than
bacilli of other diseases much more com
mon. The germs of the" disease, he' said,
wero soon killed by sunshine and drying
winds, but remained alive for long periods
in dark and damp localities. The bacil
lus caused plague. The fact was as well
established as that the earth was round.
"The Prophylaxis of Bubonic Plague"
was the subject of a paper by Dr. S. J. S.
Rodgers of Marysville, read uy Dr. Rodg
ers Jr. The paper dealt with the treat
ment of plague and with the antirplague
serum which has been used with success,
and also explained how the dread disease
could be and is spread.
Dr. . J. J. Kinyoun, Federal Quarantine
Ofticer of San Francisco, opened the dis
cussion of the plague papers and said that
owing to the long period of inaction of the
disease the medical fraternity was prone
to treat it lightly.
Dr. \\\ A. Briggs offered' a series of res

The building of the line insures the city
a bountiful supply of water from the
mountain reservoirs of the company and
the contract binds the company to sup
ply all the water needed by the city up to
tOO inches a day.
The essential part of the contract to
supply the water is found in the fact
tha* the whole hinges on the voting oC
bonds by the city next Saturday for tho
purchase of the distributing systems now
in use in the city. Thus far no opposition
to the bonds has developed. The distri
buting systems to be purchased are those
now in use by the rival companies doing
business in the city and will form on<Â»
complete system for the use of the city.
The pipe line being built will be able O
handle more water than the contract calls
for, se that San Diego will not ba In any
danger of a shortage of water In tho
future. - -
SAN DIEGO, April 16.â In its prepara
tions to carry out tne contract whereby
the city of San Diego is to be supplied
with water from the Otay reservoir the
Southern California Mountain TVater
Company has been crowding the work un
til the graders who are preparing the
grade for the immense pipe line are now
within sight - of the city. In less than
three weeks they "will have the grade
finished. The pipe line, which is to be
made of redwood, bound with steel bands,
like a long barrel,' will *be built on the
grade and not made in sections and laid,
as ia steel or iron pipe. Between 2,50O,(Xw
and 3,000,000 feet of cuefully selected lum
ber has beenÂ»dellverccl at the drying yards
on Coronado beach and 2,ut)t>,000 pounds of
steel bands comprise the lirst order for
that sort of material.
The reservoir whence the water supply
is to come is located on the Otay River,
which is dammed at a narrow gorge ia
the mesa, backing i.p the water until I:
covers an immense territory. The water
leaves the reservoir by a flve-foot tunnel
through the surrounding hill and the steel
lining of the tunnel will be fastened di
rect to the forty-inch wooden pipe. The
pipe will remain that size until it leaves
the Otay Valley, and the branches taken
off there to conduct the water to Otay,
Coronado Heights and Coronado Beacn
will permit of the pipe being made smaller
until, when it reaches tne Sweetwater
Valley, other branch lines are expected ti>
diminish the quantity of water so that a
thirty-inch pipe will be sufficient to con
duct the supply into this city. Here it Is
to be delivered, according to contract, at
the reservoir on University Heights. This
reservoir is 378 feet above the sea level
and it is possible that a different - site'
will be obtained, which will give the city
a pressure of twenty-tlve feet more.
- Though the distance from the Otay
reservoir to the city Is not more than
twenty-five miles, it is considered quua
a long route over which to bring watei"
under pressure. The ditch in which Una
piDe line will be laid is carefully graded
to insure a solid foundation throughout
the line's entire length, but it is unllku
a railroad grade, because it is possible to
follow the general contour of the hill*
There are four tunnels on the line, ail
of them through the hills which separata
the Otay Valley from Telegraph Canyon.
The four aggregate a mile and a quarter
in length and night and day shifts havo
been kept at work at either end of each
tunnel.

TPE. engagement of . a California
belle, descended from one of the
old aristocratic Spanish families
of this State, and one of San
Francisco's most prominent young
physicians, has just been announced. The
engagement is one of more than ordinary
note, owing to the prominence and popu
larity of the parties. They are Miss
Francesca Vallejo, granddaughter of the
late General M. G. Vallejo,. whose name
is one of the most familiar in the early
history of ' the State, and Dr. Charles D.
McGettigan, who has rapidly risen to a
place in the front rank of San. Francisco
physicians.
Though the doctor and his handsome
fiancee have known each other since child
hood and have always been much in each
other's company, their engagement will
be a. surprise and a pleasing one to their
friends. The couple were children to
gether in Vallejo, their, respective fami
lies being close friends, and it seems that

POSTUM CEREAL.
IT SLUGS HARD.
Coffee a Sure and Powerful Bruiser.
"jjet your coffee slave be denied his grog
at its appointed time! Headacheâ sick
stomachâ fatigue like unto death, I know
it all in myself, and have seen it in oth-
ers. Stranee that thinking, reasoning be-
ings will persist in its use," says Charles
Worrall of Topeka, Kans.
He says further that he <JId not begin
<3rlnking coffee until after he was twenty
years old, and that slowly it began to poi-
f=on him and affect his hearing through
his nervous eystem. He would quit cof-
fee and the conditions would slowly dis-
appear, but "one cold morning the smell
of my wire'6 coffee was too much for me
and I took a cup. Soon I was drinking
my regular allowance, tearing down brain
and nerves by tho daily dose of the ne-
farious concoction.
"Lat*>r I found my breath coming hard
and f reauent fits of nausea, and then I
was taken down with bilious fever.
"Common sense came to me and I quit
coffee and went back to Postum. I at
once bepan to gain and have had no re-
turns of my bilious symptoms, headache,
dizziness or vertigo.
"I now have health, bright thoughts and
added weight, where before there was ln-
valiciism, the blues and a skeletonllke
condition of the body.
"It would be hard to tell how highly I
value Postum. â¢'.-*; -Â¦'Â¦Â¦
"My brother. Professor Harvey Wor-
ra!l. <;uit coffee because of its effect on his
health and uses Postum Food Coffee." He
could not stand the nervous strain while
using- coffee, but keeps well on Postum-
"Miss Fantz I know personally has been
incapable of doing a day's work while she
was using coffee. She quit it and took
up Postum and is now well and has per-
fectly steady nerves."THE SAN FRANCISCO iCALI^ WEDNESDAY, IT, 1901.

Monteasuma Copper and CoaL
Has It ever occurred to the reader of these
advertisements that the Montezuma Mining Co.
has. by reason of Its new coal leases, an Im-
mense advantage over any other mining com-
pany less favorably situated? Such is the fact.
The Montezuma Company will mine its own
ccal, make its own coke and burn that coke In
its own smelter, thus reducing operating ex-
I>en3es to the minimum. At the same time it
Will escape the probable exactions of the smelt-
Ir.K trust. .
The Montezuma Mining: Co. Is selling stock
to continue development on its 24 copper prbp-
ertles and to build a smelter on its own lands.
Over 40 men are workins Â¦ on. the copper and
coal properties.
If you don't know It now you will one day
awake to a realization of the fact that "Cop-
per Is King." and that the Monteiuma is In
a position to- richly reward for a lifetime the
holders of its stock. We have in our offlce the
copper ores, the coal, the coke and printed
matter containing: valuable Information.
.Our special excursion for Tacoma and Seattla
Â¦tviH leave San Francisco June 13. Send for
excursion folder.
For a short time the stock In offered at 10o
per share cash or 12c per shav on installments.
Any amount will be sold for cash, but not less
than SCO shares on the installment plan. In-
stallment termsâ 5C0 shares, $6 down and $S
monthly; 1000 shares. $10 down and $10 monthly:
larger quantities at proportionate prices; 3000
shares, $50 down and $13 monthly. Including
free round-trip excursion ticket. ;
Did vou ever before hear of a mining com-
pany that was willing and anxious to show Its
properties to Its shareholders, big and little,
and would pay the expenses ot a trip to thÂ»
mines? That's what the Montezuma will do.

Kills Husband and Herself.
MASON CITY. Iowa, April 16.â At mid
night Mrs. H. B. Tunure shot and killed
her husband and then shot herself through
the heart. . It was thought she was insane.
Attorney H. n.' Lowenthal appeared be
fore Judge -Fritz at 8 o'clock last night- in
answer to a charge of embezzling $623
from Mrs. Clara Knauer. The reason
for the unusal hour of holding the court
was that Lowenthal at his first hearing
pleaded that his health was seriously af
fected, and unless he could depart for
Germany at an early date there was lit
tle chance for. his life. and. he requested
accordingly thaL all haste be made in the
settlement of Ms case. - '
Tho . proceedings last night were con
fined to an examination of the complain
ing witness, and the case was then ad
journed till 8 o'clock to-night.
As the parties were leaving the court
room Attorney Pistolesi, representing the
prosecuting witness, asked Mr. Lowenthal
when he intended to leave for Germany.
Mrs. Lowenthal, who accompanied her
husband, told him not to answer. Low
enthal states that Pistolesi then said, "If
you say that you are no lady." Lowenthal
replied that he could stand Pistolesi's
abuse of himself, but that he could not
allow such disrespectful remarks to Â¦ be
made in reference to his wife.
Lowenthal then raised his cane and at
tempted to strike Pistolesi with it. Before
any harm was done, however, friends in
tervened. , .

Western Shipyards Overlooked.
An effort is being made by the Chamber
of Commerce to have ships belonging to
the Government repaired on this coast.
Owing to strong influence ships stationed
in. China and the Philippines have been
ordered East for repairs, and the West
ern ship builders have been overlooked.
At a meeting of the trustees of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday resolutions
were adopted and Secretary Scott was in
structed to mail them to the Navy De
partment. These resolutions call atten
tion to the fact that there are fifty-seven
ships on the Western station and when
repairing is needed they should be sent to
shipyards on this coast. Captain Charles
Nelson, past president of the Chamber of
Commerce, was elected an honorary
member. William M. -Bunker was elected
a member of the board of trustees.
The members of the California Congres
sional delegation, . who' were I invited Â¦ by
the citizens' executive committee, Irving
M. Scott, chairman, to accompany Gov
ernor Gage and. staff to Redlands and
there assist In extending to President Mc-
Kinley and his Cabinet a cordial welcome
to the Golden State, have received a sup
plement to the original letter of invita
tion. The supplement advises them that
transportation is not included in the in
vitation, and that arrangements in this
respect must be made with J. C. Stubbs,
\*ice president of the Southern Pacific.
When the Congressmen received "the
notice inviting them to go south to wel
come the Presidential party to the hos
pitalities of Calif ornia . they fancied that
the managers of the excursion would pro
vide tickets. At least two of the Con
gressmen imagined that, favors in the
way . of transportation would be readily
extended to embrace passes and reserva
tions for their respective wives, so that
the ladies of the Presidential party could
be greeted by a delegation of their own
sex. Accordingly they filed requests for
additional tickets. About the time a re
sponse to the application was due the
eupplementary letter that transportation
was not included in the original invita
tion was mailed. .. - ." ' â¢
The Congressmen were certainly sur
prised, if not embarrassed, when they were
apprised of the rule. Perhaps the South
ern Pacific took a stand which surprised
the committee. The statesmen who were
honored with a call * to assist the Gover
nor and staff in receiving- the President
do not care to "talk for publication," but
they have opinions,' nevertheless, .which
they express one " to another. Of course
the price of a ticket to Redlands and re
turn is nothing to a Congressman who
represents a- district of the Golden State,
yet his sense of - propriety is shocked
when he is asked to pay the expenses, of
a function to which he is invited. He Is
wining, to buy- the ticket if the Southern
Pacific declines to furnish the committee
with .transportation, . but he hopes that
the rule applied- to members of Congress
will not bo extended to apply to the chief
executive and Cabinet officers. The old
rule of charging all the traffic will bear
ought, in Â¦ his judgment, to be suspended
for this occasion. .
One of the Congressmen remarks: "It
will be embarrassing all around if any
thing is said of this in the papers." The
chairman of the Society for the Suppres
sion of News fancies that everything can
be adjusted by requesting Irving M. Scott
to pay for the tickets. . The plan has some
merit in it when viewed from a point re
mote from Scott's zone, but that does not
touch ' the principle. Some enterprising
corporation like the Southern Pacific may
attempt to collect from the President. the
price of a ticket to his banquet, hence at
the outset it is well to establish the de
gree of legitimate tolls. .
The Republican gentlemen who were
chosen -as Presidential 'Electors last No
vember and who subsequently performed
the eminent duty of casting California's
electoral vote for .William McKinley have
not been invited to perform conspicuous
service in arranging .for the reception of
the Presidential party. The Senators and
Representatives 1 in Â¦ Congress who are in
vited to go to the" front with Governor
Gage have frequent opportunities in
Washington to see the President, whereas
equal privilege is rarely accorded to more
i^an one of the Electors. It is noted as
another oversight that â¢ these Electors
were not included in the excursion to the
State line. It is well known that Hon.
Samuel : M. Shortridge, . candidate for
United States Senator to succeed George
C. Perkins, and Hon. William R. Davis,
one of Alameda's candidates for Governor
to succeed Henry T. Gage, are ', able and
willing to pay fare from San Francisco
to Redlands and return.
SETON-THOKPSON WILL
GIVE FOUR ADDRESSES
Ernest Seton-Thompson, whose name is
to-day familiar to lovers of animals as
â¢was that of Landseer io a. former gen

Metropolitan Hall next week. He lectures
for the benefit of and under the auspices
of the California Club of California.
Seton-Thompson's knowledge of animals
was gained at first hand in American for
ests and African jungles. He has lived
for years among birds and beasts; made
friends with them, photographed them
and probably knows more interesting
facts about them than any other man liv
ing.
His first lecture will be In the afternoon
of Monday. April 22, and will be of special
interest to children. Pupils of the public
schools wishing to hear the lecture will
be, by special arrangement, relieved from
study in time. There will be another lec
ture the same evening and two more on

Bosquet Given Notice to
Quit and. Nurse ? s Suit-
Compromised.
The French colony is in a whirl of ex
citement. Last evening] the sole topic, of
discussion was the dismissal of Superin
tendent Bosquet from the French Hos
pital by the new board of directors of -tho
French Mutual Benevolent Society and
the settlement by the directors of. the
damage suit brought against the society"
by Miss Margaret Hanavan, the pretty
nurse who was dismissed by ex-President
Chartrey when -he was in power. . *
When President Dupas and his asso
ciates recently took office it was decided
that ths head of Bosquet should fall. The
new board of. directors were: all anti-
Chartrey men and they arranged to oust
Bosquet, who .was placed in office by
Chartrey. â¢ â¢ .
The directors have already notified Bos
quet that his services will not be required
after this month and this evening a new
superintendent will be elected by the
board.
The suit of Miss Hanavan arose out of.
ber refusal to apologize to Chartrey and
Bosquet. Miss Hanavan claimed that
Bosquet had annoy sd her with his unwel
come attentions and it was rumored
around the hospital that Bosquet had
kissed -the pretty nurse despite her pro
tests.
Miss Hanavan made complaint to Chart
rey against Bosquet and the ex-president
took sides with the superintendent and
asked the nurse to make apology for un
warranted charges.
Miss Hanavan stood firm and refused to
apologize, claiming that she was the one
entitled to an apology. Chartrey dis
chaiged the nurse from duty, declining to
give her a diploma when she demanded
one. Miss Hanavan then brought suit
against the society for $5000 damages for
breach of contract and injury caused 'by
the diploma being kept from her. Henley
& Costello were the attorneys employed
by Miss Hanavan and it was expected
that when the case came on for trial that
sensational testimony would be given.
The recently elected board of directors
of the French Society are anxious to wipe
out all memories of the scandals that ex
isted during the regime of Chartrey and
Bosquet as president and superintendent
respectively.
With that object in view a conference

Dr. Ra!r>h A. Huntinston, who was con
victed of manslaughter by a jury In Judge
Lawlor's court on January 23 and- sen
tenced to serve ten years in San Quentin
on February 19 In connection with the
murder of Miss Jennie McKown, his
sweetheart, has been in the County Jail
since, as notice of appeal was given to
the Supreme Court.
Yesterday Huntington's attorney, ex-
Judge Ferral. appeared before Judge Law
lor and asked that the defendant be ad
mitted to bail. Otherwise the latter would
be dead in a few days, the attorney said.
He called Dr. Morrissey, city physician,
who testified that Huntington was suffer
ing from nervous prostration and acute
gastritis, and if he was not instantly re
leased from jail his mental and physical
condition would soon pass to the hopeless
stage. He had -not eaten any food for
over 'two weeks and was so weak that he
had to be carried around, Morrissey said.
Chief Jailer Frank W. Cornyn corrob
orated the doctor's testimony. Hunting
ton was carried to a place Monday where
he could sit in the sun. but he was so
weak that he fainted. .He had been for
more than two weeks unable to restrain
any food on his stomach. He was con
stantly grieving over his punishment and
looked like a dving man.
The Judge, after deliberation, decided
in the circumstances to admit the de
fendant to ball in $10,000, and yesterday
afternoon the defendant's mother and her
friend, Mrs. Lockford, qualified on the
bond and the Judge gave them an order
for the defendant's release from Jail.
They are the same sureties as on the
bond given at the time of his arrest.
