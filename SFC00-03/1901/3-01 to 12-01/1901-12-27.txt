Fears Entertained That
a Steamer Has
Been Lost.
Many. Cases of Salmon Float
to the Vancouver
Beaches.
Shipping Men in the North Suspect
That an Alaska Liner Met
With Disaster in a
Storm.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Dec. 26.-From the
number of salmon cases and other bits of
Jetsam now floating in along the shore
lina of Greers Beach and English Bay
bearing Alaskan marks it is greatly
feared that in the gale of last night one
of the Alaskan steamships, possibly the
Cottage City, has come to grief near Van
couver.
The disaster obviously occurred not far
away, since the bits of broken cases all
chow little signs of water wear and all
faeir markings are as distinct and fresh
as well can be. A number of painted
boards which evidently belonged to tlie
â¢upper works of some steamer were also
found.
This morning boxes were picked up on
the shore line all the way from the beach
immediately south of False Creek right
around to the English Bay cannery. These
began to come in about 9 o'clock. Most
of the boxes were from the Icy Pass Can
ning Company, Alaska, the Star of India
brand, and from the Kanakan Packing
Company. Kanakan, Alaska, Red Beauty
brand. The cases are intact. From the
marks of the water on them it is plain
ihey have been in the water but a short
time, for the boxes have not even been
soaked through, and from this it Is
thought that the disaster must have oc
curred on nearby shores. The edges and
of the cases are hardly worn, and
Notwithstanding the action of the heavy
.fceas and the rolling on the rocks at the
beach evidences of friction are barely dis-
cernible.
"What is remarkable is that the salmon
cases did not begin to arrive until late
this morning and were blown In by the
wind from the direction of Bowen Island
and Point Gray, nine miles out. Ever
since that hour the cases have been float
ing In and salvers en the beach are reap
ing a bountiful harvest.
It can only be purmised from what boat
the fish have como. The Cottage City.
â "vhlch took the run of the City of Seattle,
left last Thursday on a trip to Sitka, and,
It Is thought, called at Icy Pass and Kan
akan. where she would take on salmon
at this time of year and in all probability
v.-ould have some of these brands. The
Icy Strait Cannery is owned by a com
pany In which Thomas Earle, M- P., was
the largest stockholder. Indeed virtual
proprietor. It is stated that the Cottage
City was more than likely to have some
of his pack on board for Eastern ship
ment. No Alaska salmon, it may be men
tioned, was stored at nearby points from
which it could have been washed.

L LONDON, Dec. 25.â As a Christmas at
traction the Dally News has been at
tempting to obtain the views of prominent
men on the best way of "waking up Eng
land," in view of American and German
commercial competition. The paper con
sulted Sir Thomas Sutherland, Kenric B.

of Commerce, and others, only to discover
the greatest divergence in the views of the
persons questioned as to whether any real
necessity for "waking up England"
exists.

OF ANTI-TOXINE
Negro Janitor Causes
t Deaths of Sixteen
Children.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 26.-Before the teta
nus court of inquiry to-day Henry It.
Taylor, janitor for the chemical and bac
teriological divisions of the Health De
partment, admitted under oath that he
Issued for public use the toxic antl-dlph
theritic serum, which caused the -recent
deaths of sixteen children from tetanus.
He distributed the vials, properly label
ed, he said, because the supply of diph
theria antl-toxine had become exhausted
early In October, and he did not belle ve
that the serum was "bad enough to kill
children."
Taylor is a negro. He has held city po
sitions for many years. In addition, to
his duties as janitor he acted as assist-
ant to Consulting City Bacteriologist
Amand Ravold. More or less in the ca
pacity of an assistant he had charge of
the antl-toxine when it was in flasks and
after it had been poured into the vials
for distribution to physicians.
For two hours Taylor was closeted this
afternoon with Chief of Detectives Des
mond. Taylor was placed on the witness
stand with the Chief of Detectives at
his side. Mayor Wells advised Taylor to
give a distinct, true, connected relation of
facts appertaining to the toxic, serum.
Taylor then admitted that his former tes
timony, in which he swore that serum of
September 20 had not been distributed,
was false. Taylor said positively that he
gave out serum of the make of Septem
ber 30. This serum, it is alleged, was re
sponsible for the deaths of sixteen or
more children.
Taylor said the serum of September 30
was !not destroyed until after the trouble
began, and that he had been trying to
"protect the whole oflice."

V
Cursing Mob Beats Retreat and Makes 4 a
Stand* in the Presidio Grove,/ Where
One Man Is Nearly Trampled to Death
TJJERE -was rioting outside the
Presidio gates again last night.
Angered by the severe repulse
they had received at the hands
of the police, provost guard? and
cavalry on Christmas day, the mob of in
furiated soldiers who tried to wreck Dave
Tarpey's and other saloons in the neigh
borhood returned to the attack last even-
Ing. Fully 1000 desperate men in blue
threw their fear of the police and natural
instinct to obey their superior officers to
the fbur^winds and charged pell-mell, like
a herd of infuriated cattle, on Tarpey's
saloon, and many crowded into the place
in wild disorder.
Louis Tarpey, the 16-year-old son of the
proprietor of the Vs'n mill," was in the
act of drawing a glass of beer, and one of
the soldiers picked up a chair and struck
him down with a blow on the head and
shoulders. \ Then the rioters demolished
everything 1 in sight, both in front and be
hind the bar, and rushed out again Into
the street and prepared to give the police
| a battle. Dave Tarpey and his son made
good their escape through the back way.
In the melee that occurred outside one
soldier was trampled down and terribly
mangled.
The assault was evidently planned with
deliberation. The recruits and . casuals
who participated in it were not under the
influence of liquor. â 
After wrecking Tarpey's saloon the an
gry soldiers engaged in another riotous
skirmish with the police, and a detach
ment of mounted light artillery from the
Eighteenth Regiment was dispatched to
the scene as quickly as possible after the
.first outbreak occurred. The police faced
the soldiers with their clubs, and the riot
ers, armed with sticks and rocks, beat a
sullen retreat.
* Several Shots Axe Fired.
Several shots were fired, windows were
broken and the shattered glass ' was
picked up by the rioting soldiers and
thrown in all directions. They yelled like
a band of Comanches. Vile epithets were
hurled at the police and the excitement
reached an intense pitch;
On Greenwich street the soldiers made
their first stand. Policemen : Hostetter,
Herlng, Rice and Stratton were on duty
in the neighborhood when the trouble
commenced. A. riot call was sent to the
North End and Central stations and Lieu
tenant Martin and a squad of police re
sponded from the Central and Sergeant
Campbell with another squad came from
the North End.
Saloon-keeper Tarpey barricaded his
doors after the soldiers left and then' ran
into the reservation . to. seek the protec
tion of the military authorities. While he
was gone . the mob of soldiers secured a
stout board, . and using it as a battering
'ram, splintered the barricaded doors of
the saloon and added a few finishing
touches to the work of wrecking the place.
About this time the police arrived and
charged the desperate mob with their
clubs.
The rioters retreated to Greenwich
street in front of the reservation and
assailed Anderson's^ saloon and the Can
teen across on Lyon street with mud and
rocks. They broke several windows and
a number of people were struck with the
flying missiles.
One Man Perhaps Fatally Trampled.
The police fought the mob gamely and
were gradually forcing the angry soldiers
inside the reservation when a detachment
of mounted light artillery, commanded by
Captain Rumbaugh, dashed up Greenwich
street toward the maddened throng. Cap
tain Miller, officer of the day, appeared
on the scene also with a big provost
guard, and they, too, engaged the mob.
The mounted artillerymen drove the riot
ers into the reservation and they then
entrenched themselves in the thick grove
of trees just Inside the gate. The soldiers
refused to go farther, thinking that the
mounted men would not pursue them into
the small forest. But In this they were
mistaken as more than one: of .the rioters
found to their sorrow. The mob hooted,
Jeered and howled at their mounted pur
suers, and this > enraged the artillerymen
beyond measure. Right on through the
thick grove of trees charged the artillery
men. They \ rode right . into the middle
of the throng and trampled some' of the
rioters down. William Hawley, a recruit
from Alabama, had enough liquor aboard
to be particularly ugly, and one of the
artillerymen knocked him 'down' and the
horse j trampled over his prostrate body,
inflicting injuries from which he will not
recover for many a day. When picked up
by a fellow-soldier ' shortly ' after the
trouble was quelled Hawley. was. uncon
scious. They removed him- to- the Gen
eral Hospital on'a stretcher, and Dr. Ben
nett, who was in charge, dressed hia in
juries. Hawley's left leg was shattered
and over and under his left eye there was
a gash bearing the shape of a horse's
hoof. Hawley had not regained conscious
ness up to a late hour last night, and the
physicians fear that he may have re
ceived severe internal injuries.
Fear Still Another Riot.
After the mounted soldiers had routed
the mob, the provost guard searched the
grove for stragglers. Several were found
and locked up in the guardhouse.
After l the â  disturbance extra policemen
were stationed on Baker, Lyon and Green
wich streets, and as fast as any soldiers
showed up they were hustled into the
reservation. â -:..:' /

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 26.-A Washington
dispatch to the Record-Herald says: It
may be Panama after all. As soon as the
holidays are over and Congress returns to
town, the battle of the canals is expected
to rage with great fury. Nicaragua still
ha3 the advantage, but it is not to be
permitted to carry off the honors with
out a struggle. Panama is developing un
looked for strength.
A private telegram from Paris received
here Indicates that the new Panama
Canal Company is prepared to submit to
the United States a definite offer of sale
at a value set by the Walker commission
namely $40,000,000. t'-c-j
If the Panama Company does submit
such an offer and includes in It all Its
property of whatever description, there te
at least a chance that the strong tide now
running in favor of the Nicaragua may
be stemmed.
In the Senate a strong Panama party is
developing. Influential Senators say pri
vately to your correspondent that they
are convinced Panama is by long odds
the better route, and that if any offer to
sell at the commission's valuation Is re
ceived, they declare it will receive favor
able attention at the hands of the Senate.

LONDON, Dec. 26.â General Dewet has

AGREEMENT THAT STALLS

WASHINGTON, Dec. . 26.-The Argen
tina Minister, Dr. Garcia-Merou. to-day
received a dispatch from the Minister of
Foreign Affairs at Buenos Ayres announc
ing the satisfactory termination of the
Chile-Argentina trouble and giving the
basis of settlement. The dispatch is as
follows:
"The pending incidents with Chile have
been settled by agreement directly # wlth
the Government of that country and in a
satisfactory form. Chile gives explanation
of the opening of roads through the dis
puted territory, and both Governments
agree to withdraw the police forces which
they have maintained in the territory in
controversy, situated near the inlet of
Ultima Esperanza. . ALCORTA,
"Minister of Foreign Affairs."
Dr. Garcia-Merou expresesd himself as
highly gratified with the disappearance of
the war cloud, and pointed out that tho
terms of settlement showed that Argen
tina's earnest desire to maintain peace
had led her to make a considerable sacri
fice. By both forces withdrawing their
police from that locality the Government
ownership of the Ultima Esperanza ter
ritory becomes a question for arbitration.
DIAMOND CHAIN TAKEN ggj

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â A mysterious
robbery of a diamond chain valued at
$3500, of which either the Adams Express
Company or Shaw & Berry, a local jew
elry firm which shipped it to New York,
are probably the victims, occurred some
time between Sunday afternoon and this
forenoon. The jewelry was dispatched
from here to Joseph Frankel & Sons, No.
63 Nassau street. New York. When deliv
ered there was no evidence that the seal
had been tampered with, and the pack
age was not opened In New York until
to-day, when the chain was found miss
ing.
The stolen gems numbered 300, and were
set in a platinum lorgnette chain fifty
four Inches long. The package was made
up by the local firm under the personal
supervision of the proprietors, and duly
â registered. Detectives here and in New
York are working on the case. It is sup
posed that the package was opened by
some one acquainted with its contents,
the chain removed, and the package thea
restored to Its original appearance.

NAVY TO TEST
NEW TELEGRAPH
Takes the Initial Steps
Toward Using Wire
less System.
Armored. Cruisers to Be Pre
pared to Conduct the
Experiments.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â The Navy De
partment has taken the initial steps to
ward the adoption of wireless telegraphy
as a means of signaling between war
ships at sea. To this end Admiral Brad
ford of the bureau of equipment has
asked that the armored cruisers of the
Pennsylvania class have their masts and
rigging- so arranged that the wireless sys
tem can be introduced. This will necessi
tate the lengthening of the masts of the
ships and the insulation of the metal rig
ging by the use of a hemp covering for
the halyards. It is intended to get test
Fets of instruments of the various wire
less system now being operated. Thes3
include the Marconi system. Thus far,
however, the Navy Department has not
adopted definitely any system, but the
construction of the new ships is regarded
as a preliminary to the adoption of a sys
tem whenever its practicability is estab
lished. The British navy already has a
number of its ships equipped with the
wireless system, but this is the first move
on the part of tho American navy ta make
use of a wireless plan.
HALIFAX N. S.. Dec. 26.â The steam
er Bruce, with Signer Marconi en board,
arrived at North Sydney to-day. Marconi
was met by Mr. Smith on behalf of the
Canadian Government, Premier Murry of
the Nova Scctia Government and Mayor
McKenzie of North Sydney. Marconi and
the Government representatives held a
short conference, and Marconi afterward
expressed a desire to place on record his
appreciation <:f the courtesy shown him
by the Canadian Government and its de
sire to further his experiments. He thinks
it probable that a spot in Cape Breton will
be selected for a permanent station, and
he says that the point chosen must be
from 100 to 200 feet above the sea level.
Marconi will remain in Cape Breton a few
days and then proceed to Ottawa.
When asked as to the present stage of
his experiments in telegraphing across
the Atlantic, Marconi said that up to the
present only one letter, continuously re
peated, had beea received.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A COMMON TROUBLE.
Thousands Suffer From It .Without'
Knowing Its Heal Character.
No trouble :s more common or -more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia,
feople having it think that their nerves
ate io blame, are surprised that they are
liot cured by nerve medicines and spring
remedies; the real seat of the mischief
is lost Right of; the stomach is the organ
to be looked after.
"â Nervous uytpeptics often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the utual symptoms of
ctomach weakness. Nervous ayspepsia
shows itself not in the stomach so much
as in nearly every other organ; in some
casts the heart palpitates and is irregu-
iar; in others the Kidneys are affected;:
in others the Vowels are troubled, wlih
joes ot fleeh and appetite, with the ac-
cumulation of gas, sour risings and heari-
fcurn.
Mr. A. W. Sharper of No. Cl Prospect
St., Indianapolis, lnd., writes as follows:
"A motive of pure gratitude prompts me
to write these few lines regarding the
rew and valuable medicine, Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I have been a sufferer
from rervous dyspesia for the last four
years; have used various patent medicines
and other remedies without anv favorable
result. They sometimes gave temporary
relief until the effects of the medicine
wore off. I attributed this to my sedentary

physical exercise, but I am glad to state
that the tablets have overcome all these
obstacles, for 1 have gained in flesh, sleep

The Colombian gunboat General Pin

Here for Rio Hacha. It is reported from
the interior of Colombia that there has
been no recent serious lighting there. A
lew Liberal insurgents .were round near
Honda, on the -Magdalena River. They
were easily defeated and dispersed by
the Government troops.
The Colombian Conservative General
Castro, considering it next to impossible
to surround the Liberal leader, Lorenzo,
;<nd his followers, who are now in La
Negrila Mountains, has come- to the con
ciusion that the Government's best pol
icy is to garrison thfe interior towns
strongly in the neighborhood of the Lib
eral retreat, thus cutting off Lorenzo's
supplies and ultimately forcing him to
surrender.
General Castro is an eld Indian
fighter. He has campaigned in the Gua
jira Peninsula and in the Colombian De
partment of Cauca. He is familiar with
the Indian tactics of warfare used by
Lorenzo.
Indiana Beaches Willemstad.
WASHINGTOfr, Dec. 26.â The Indiana
has arrived at Willemstad, island of
Curacao. There have been reports '.hat
there was? yellow fever at Curacao, and
as the Navy Department does not wish
to subject the crew of the Indiana to any
(larger inquiry was instituted by the offi
cials here to iearn whether the disease
was prevalent there. If there is any dan
ger the Indiana will not remain there.
Mail advices received at the. Colom
bian legation speak of the disturbed
financial condition of the country, .re
sulting from the strain of the rebellion.
Paper money has depreciated so that $45
in paper money is equivalent to only $1
in gold. Mr. Herran, the Charge at the
legation, said to-night: i
"The rebellion is now practically over.
There are only scatttered marauding
bands left, numbering not much more
than 300 men. These are in the Isthmus
of Panama and the state of Toulama, but
they, are being wined out rapidly. The
rebellion broke out in October, 1899, and
has cost the country the lives of 50 000
able-bodied men, the sinews of her pop
ulation, and $250,000,000 in money, and has
left the country in a state of exhaus
tion." â¢ -

PINCHES BEARS
"Shorts" Are Treated to
Costly Surprise on
'Change. .
Special Dlepatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 26.â American Sugar
Refinery stock turned on the "shorts"
to-day and for a while financial fur
flew on the New York Exchange. Wall
street has been selling the stock of the
Sugar Refining Company lately with con
fidence and with a break in the price
from above 120 nearly to par. The con
fidence was born of the admitted enor
mous oversupply of raw sugars, both
beet and cane, throughout the world, the
announcements of cuts in prices by va
rious refiners and the ease with which
the stock had gone down, ro-day the
price of the stocK opened at 105&, falling
with scarcely any hesitation to 103%,
when it began to rally. .
The bears kept on bravely selling, for
they argued that the buying demand was
probably but a little covering of con
tracts by other "shorts,", who were go
ing to miss the real pie and only get the
crust. But the stock, though it dropped
a little' every now and then, kept stead
ily tending upward. Thousands upon
thousands of-snares were dealt In and
the bears were" plainly getting nervous.
The price finally got above 109 and there
was a rush of bears to cover. The
price ran "up^ in a few minutes from
108% to 112y 2 , fell to lllMsf then jumped to
113%, Closing at 112*4, a net advance of
6% points -for the day.,.. The sales were

WhilqVtAQ price of the. stock was jump

"things^Tiad -Â«naaTred-"up-- in -the -sugar

an important- conference had been held
cl leading 'Stigar refinery interests at
which â  a. "truce ' had been declared."

It was .-r.that rJames H. Post,

OMAHA, Neb.. Dec. 26.â The Bee will
print an announcement to-morrow morn
ing based on direct information from, the
family of F. D. Coburn of Kansas to the
effect that the Kansan will be tendered
the portfolio of Agriculture in President
Roosevelt's Cabinet. Coburn is serving
his fourth term as Secretary, of tne
Kansa's State Board of Agriculture, and
his work in the advancement of husban
dry in his State has been widely ack-;
nowledged. ' . . .
Coburn only missed the appointment
by a narrow margin when McKiniey s
Cabinet was formulated, and his candi
dacy came at once into prominence again
when Secretary Wilson's friends saw
the impropriety of the Cabinet contain
ing two members from such an over
whelmingly Republican State as Iowa.
His appointment in this instance, it is
said, will follow at once upon the notice
of Secretary Wilson's retirement. .,

AUSTIN; Tex., Dec. 26.â Governor Les-;
lie M.-Shawj who. has been tendered the:
appointment of Secretary of the Treas
ury by tne. President, is another person
of national, prominence who has made a
big fortune out. of the Beaumont oil dis
covery. Governor'Shaw was one of the
pioneers in the development of the rice
growing industry in Western- Louisiana
and Eastern Texas. Through the efforts
of Governor Shaw and associates large
tracts of rice lands around Orange and
Beaumont, Tex., were developed by Iowa
colonists, and when the oil discovery was
made at Beaumont ten months ago they,
quickly proilted by the increased value
of their land, which doubled many times
within a few :weeks. In addition to this,
wealth derived from this rapid increase
in the value of his^ lands. Governor Shaw
is interested In -.several large oil compa
nies which are operating extensively in :
the Beaumont fields. It was stated here
to-day by men who are acquainted with
tiovernor Shaw's holdings around Beau
mont that the oil discovery has brought
him .a fortune of not less than $800,000.
He had the good fortune to be onv the
ground floor so far as owning prospective'
oil lands in that district was concerned. 1
DES MOINES, Dec. 26.â Governor Shaw
to-night received the following message
from - President Roosevelt, the.-, first he

ADOPT A SCHEME

Pan-American Delegates
Are Unanimous on
the Subject.
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 26.â A substantial
agreement on the subject of arbitration,
was practically reached to-day by the
several delegations to the Pan-American
conference. Contrary to what had been
anticipated, it is almost sure that the
agreement is unanimous, Including even
Argentina, which country, it was thought
would refuse to sign any but a compul
sory scheme of arbitration. The basis of
agreement is simply the Hague conven
tion. All the nations represented at the
SÂ«?ffi"- en * ce â¦Â£* ?? exlco City, will become
ESÂ£h?V? the Hague convention. They
m ? i Â°J n U independently, but as the
United States and Mexico are already
members of the Hague convention, It has

other than the United. States. Chile. Co
lombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and perhaps
one or two others, will sign among them
selves a scheme of compulsory arbitra
tion, but still accepting the Hague tribu
nal and the Hague procedure. This com
pulsory plan hWvever. will have effect
only among the signatory nations and will
not have the official sanction of the Pan-
American conference. -
A sentiment is growing up in favor of

the closing of the conference.

HANNA SKETCHES
M'KINLEY'S LIFE
Writes of Dead President
as He Knew Him for
Thirty Years.
Tells of the Qualities That
Won for Him Hosts of
â¢ Loyal Frienda
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Dec. 26.â The January num
ber of the National Magazine will con
tain the first of a series of articles by
Senator M. A. Hanna on "William Mc-
Kiniey as I Knew Him." Senator Hanna,
through his close friendship for the mar
tyred President, Is enabled to write with
intimate knowledge of Mr. â  McKlnley's
personal life and characteristics.' In In
troducing the article ne says:
It is something over thirty jears ago that I
first knew William McKiniey, a youn<j practic
ing attorney at Canton, Ohio. Strange as It
may seem, I cannot recall the cxa^t time or
piace wlien I nrs: met him. I know that It
was early in the seventies, and I have a recol-
Ivcuon of being atrangsiy attracted to the quiet
and methodical lawyer. Our acquaintance was
somewhat CKser after his elaction to Congress
and In some way I always felt a personal In
terest In his contests from time to time. Our
acquaintanceship was a simple growth of
friendship. Hia splendid work In tne cause of
protection aa a Congressman further attracted
me. This waa even before he had reached
prominence In Congress as a member of the
Ways and Means Committee. I never thought
of the possibility at that time of his becoming
a candidate for the Presidency and was not
especially active In politics except in so far as
exercising my influence in the interests of the
Republican party. Our tirst association politi
cally was in 18&O, when Ohio took a prominent
part in the campaign In Which Garflfld was
elected. . .
Senator Hanna, after describing the
steady growth of his friendship tor the
late President, writes that it was in 18SS
when McKinley developed a positive na
tional force. McKinley- was pledged with
the other delegates from Ohio to cast
their ballots in the convention for John
isherman. McKinley's name was brought
forward as a candidate and the loyal
speech he made in withdrawing won for
him the friends and supporters who after
ward joined their hands in making him
President. Writing of that occurrence,
Senator Hanna says of the dead Presi
dent:
Rare Qualities of Manhood.
His utterances in that convention are the
best index to his character that I know of.
and displayed In him those rare qualities of
manhood which convinced me that he was des
tined to becortie a great power In national poli
tics. And here for the first time it occurred
to me that he was a logical candidate for the
â¢Presidency in years to come. I was with him
In 1892 at Minneapolis, and as it will be re
membered, the demand from the people for
McKiniey as a candidate was even mere out
spoken and seemingly irresistible than at the
that it would have been an easy matter for
him . to have spoken and won the entire sup
port of the Blaine men, to say nothing of his
many admirers among those pledged for Har
rison. At that time it was evident to even
the most casual observer that sooner or later
I he would be placed in that high position for
which his talent and particular abilities quali
fied him.
The demonstration at Minneapolis convinced
mo that, although it waÂ» an impolitic thing
for his Interests to nominate him there, that
in the next national convention the popular de
mand for his candidacy would override all op
position.
The condition of the country that followed
the election of 1892 so clearly denned him as
the one man of all others in public life to
lead the Republican party that I felt that h:s
nomination was assured.
As early as 1S04 I began to feel the pulse
of the people; that Is, the rank and file, busi
ness men. laboring men, traveling men and
manufacturers, to' learn. how far the sentiment
for McKiniey had taken hold. .It required only
the opportunity for the people of the Northern
States to express their sentiment on the sub
ject, and the result St. Louis lustifled the
expectations of his friends anjl admirers and
gave proof of the correctness of their Judg
ment in believing him to be the one man who
fitted the situation and Insured the success of
the party. â¢
Had Great Confidence in His Friends.
Senator Hanna managed the campaign
that followed and writes interestingly of
how McKinley's strong and noble person
ality contributed to its success:
â  His entire and complete confidence In those
who were conducting the affairs of the cam
paign stimulated them to their utmost efforts,
inspiring in them a desire to show their ap
preciation of this confidence and trust in them.
1 don't believe that any other political cam
paign in the history of the Republican party
ever demonstrated such a growing Interest and
enthusiasm, and above all confidence, in the
personality of the candidate, which continued
to grow and increase from the opening of the
campaign to the great climax of flag day,
which marked an epoch in the campaign of
l$OtJ.
If there were any dark days in the campaign
It waa during the earlier weeks of the work.
It was at that time that William McKiniey in
his conversation with us showed his buoyant
spirit and his strong faith in the common peo
ple of the country, believing that they would
meet and solve the question right and indorse
the principles which were to bring relief to all.
lie insisted that all that was necessary was to
make them understand the cause and effect of
the principles advocated by both parties. â¢ â¢ â¢
His victory was greater in its triumphal
faith of the people in him than merely in the
choice of himself as President of the United
States. This was the subject that In after
years we often talked about, and it was a
beautiful thing to me to see how much he
realized and appreciated the confidence which
had come to him as a result of his abiding
faith in the people. If there had been no other
motive, thi3 waa the great incentive for him
to use all the power and talent with which he
had been endowed to give the people in return
for their confidence his best life work. And
he consecrated the best efforts of his life to
fulfill their expectations.
My associations with him during the yearj
of executive life gave me further opportunity
to appreciate aa I never had before the great
reserve force which he possessed. He seema
to have met every emergency and the unusual
problems and annoying complications of the
times in a masterful way. These conditions
furnished the opportunity for him to demon
strate his enormous talent and ability for suc
cessfully solvlne every problem, rising to the
full measure of every situation and overcom
ing' all obstacles.
Won the Respect of All Classes.
And then the summing of It all In that beau
tiful death, which was so characteristic of his
career, is one almost unequaled In history.
He has won the admiration, love and respect
of all classes of his own people and of all na
tions.
After briefly referring to the sad ending
of McKinley's life. Senator Hanna con
cludes the article:
It la difficult for me to express the extent
of the love and respect which I, In common
with many others, felt for him personally. The
feeling was the outgrowth of an appreciation
of his noble, self-sacrificing nature. My af
fection for him and faith and confidence In him
always seemed to be reciprocated, to the ex
tent that there was never an unpleasant word
passed between us, and the history of his ad
ministration, his Cabinet and his associations
with public men, so entirely free from Intrigue
or base selfishness, I think will be a splendid
example to the youth of the coming genera
tions. There was nothing in the expression of
his face or manner denoting, exultation over
his victory when it wa3 announced that he was
elected President. He seemed to realize fully
the sacred responsibilities placed upon him, and
the Quiet dignity and self-possession which'
marked the man' then and In days after were
Just what his personal friends expected of him.
The first day I greeted him after he was In
augurated at the White House in the course of
our conversation I Inadvertently called him
"Major" and "Governor," and when I stopped
to correct myself, he would say, "Each one Is
fitting; I'm not particular which."
ZIONIST CONGRESS OPENS
WITH A LARGE ATTENDANCE
President of the Conference Expresses
Absolute Confidence in the
. Colonization Movement.
BASLE, Switzerland, Dec. 26.â The Zion
ist Congress opened here to-day under th"
presidency of Dr. Theodore Herzl of Vienl
na, the founder of the Zionist movement

more than 1000 delegates, representing
every important country in the world
with the exception of Australia.
In the course of his opening address
President Herzl referred to his audience
with* the Sultan last May, in which the
Sultan expressed his sympathy with the
Zionist movement and said he considered
; the Jews to be desirable colonists and
'declared himself their friend.
Dr. Herzl said that he had absolute con

where efforts toward charitable coloniza
tion had failed.

Any Piano Sold at This Sale and Not

May Be Kept by the Recipient
Without Further Payment on the
Contractâ We Mean Business â
Everything Must Be Found Satis-
factory or No Sale.
"Two weeks ago my partner paLSv $625
for a piano not nearly so fine as the> <?nÂ«
I have just bought for $3S5," said a. de-
lighted buyer at Ellers Piano Company*b
sacrifice sale yesterday. "And," he conr
tinued. "if the public only knew what *
veritable bonanza is presented to piano
buyers here you would not have a slngla
pianc for sale this evening."
Many do not understand how it is pos-,
sible for us to sell these filter nÂ§w pianos
at such a tremendous reduction' in price.
But it la simply this: Before January 1 we
must turn this entire wholesaler stock of
pianos into cash or interest-bearing notes.
The question of profit or even coat does
not enter into the proposition at all and
â when you realize that it costs an ordinary
dealer an enormous amount of money to
sell a piano at retail, not to say anything
of the freights and actual factory cost of
the instrument, you will understand the
difference that exists between the actual
wholesale factory cost and the retail sell-
ing: price.
But time is the important consideration
in this matter. If you wish to take ad-
vantage of this money-saving opportunity
you will have to act at once. Now, right
now, to-day, ia the time for you to at-
tend to this, while the assortment i3 com-
plete. You will find here now the most
beautiful display of pianos ever seen in
San Francisco, instruments of the highest
grade that ordinarily could not be secured

ALTURAS, Dec. 2S.-A considerable
measure of yuletlde good-will infused into
la* yers -- and witnesses in the Lookout
lynching: case rendered the proceedings
unaramonly serene to-day.
Tha harsh word and the ominous threat
were eliminated, the attorneys addressed
each other with Chesterfieldian grace of
manner and tone and there was not the
remotest suggestion of the recent tem
pestuous scenes which have already made
the trial one of the most picturesque ever
held in California.
Whether this be a lull before the wind
blows up the storm or a settled course of
conduct no one ventures to conjecture.
The people hereabout are maintaining a
resolute silence in nearly everything that
appertains to the exciting old practice of
lynching.
One of the interesting features of to
day's session was the examination of the
ropes used In hanging the five men.
The first witness this morning was Dr.
C. M. Tinsman of Adin. He was the phy
sician at the inquest held over the bodies
of Calvin Hall, Frank and Jim Hall. Dan
"Vantis and Martin Wilson at Lookout.
He stated that he made a thorough exam
ination of the heads and necks of the
men lynched, but did not examine the
bodies, and could not state positively as
to any other mutilation than the breaking
of their necks. Ke noticed no signs of
violence about their faces. He believed
that they came to their death by strangu
lation.
Sheriff B. B. Street testified relative to
the position of the Lookout bridge, and
stated that the body of Martin Wilson
was in a hall in Lookout when he arrived
there.
C. R. Harris of Adin, Justice of the Peace
an4 acting coroner at the inquest, was
nc%: put upon the stand. Harris stated
thai he went to Lookout on the 31st of
May to hold an inquest. The ropes with
which the men were hanged were brought
in by the clerk and Harris Identified them
as the ropes with which Calvin Hali,
Martin Wilson. Bill and Frank Hall and
Dan Yantis were swung from the bridge.
The ropes are all strong ones, each about
three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and
at the end of each is a regulation hang
man's knot.
Harris Etated that when he first saw the
bodies at Lookout the ropes were etill
around the necks of men. Harris tagged
the ropes himself and had his wife write
the names on the tags. Harris was not
positive whether the hands of Martin
Wilson were tied or not. He believed that
the hands of all save one were tied. Cal
vin Hall was barefooted, the Indians had
on socks but no shoes and Dan Yantis
had on shoes. He saw Calvin Hall. Jim
and Frank Hall and Dan Yantis buried.
All were buried in the same grave, which
was dug just large enough for four cof
fins. Martin Wilson was buried separate
ly. All tne coffins furnished were of good
material.

BAKERSFIELD, Dec 26.â The discov
ery has been msfie through the arrival of
Amos Lichty at the County Hospital from
Randsburg that about twenty residents
of that place are afflicted with smallpox.
The disease had been pronounced a skin
affection and but little attention was at
first paid to it. Later so many were
taken ill that a physician was called from
this city. He also pronounced the causes
skin disease. Dr. Schafer, the County
Physician, was also called to Randsburg
and be stated that the cases were those

Lichty has been removed to the pest
house and the Board of Supervisors has
been notified. Many residents of Rands

is not smallpox, and an expert may be
called to give his 'views.

OLYMPIA. 'Wash., Dec. 26.âGov
ernor John R, Rogers died this
evening at 8 o'clock after an Ill
ness of six days. This morning
he began to sink and passed into
a comatose state. He grew steadily weak
er throughout the day. The collapse was
a surprise to his physician and family, as
he rested better last night than he had
since his illness began. He took some
nourishment this morning, but became
unconscious about 9 o'clock.
Mrs. Rogers and the Governor's daugh
ters Mrs. Blackman and Miss Helen
Rogers, were at his bedside all day. The
Governor's son, Edwin Rogers, who Is in
London, was cabled, and F. J. Roger?,
the Stanford University professor, and

and Private Secretary Peletiere, together
with Chief Justice Reavis and Justice

tendance at the house during the day.
The first symptoms of Governor Rogers'
illness developed Friday. Friday after
noon at his office he contracted a chill. A
fever resulted and by 10 o'clock Saturday
morning the Governor began to complain
of pains in his chest. The fever increased
slightly and the pains became' quite se

Shinano Maru Arrives
in Port With Blaze in
Her Hold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. 25.â The Shinano Maru,
of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, arrived in
Port Townsend harbor at 4 o'clock this
morning with fire in her hold. A hurri
cane was blowing at the time and her
signals of distress were not responded to
from shore until after daybreak. British
Vice Consul Oscar Klocker then put off in
the steamer Wildwood, and, running
alongside, learned from the captain that
the flames were consuming his cargo. Al
though by the hard work of the crew the
blaze had been well confined, it had been
impossible to suppress It.
Meager details of the Shinano's plight
were brought to Seattle this even
ing by storm-belated steamers arriving
from Port Townsend. The hurricanes of
Christmas night prostrated telegraph and
telephone wires to all down-Sound points.
When the Wiidwood put back from her
visit to -the Japanese liner she met the
steamer North Pacific, Just starting for
Seattle, and passed the information.
The steamer Alice Gertrude, leaving
Port Townsend shortly after the Nortn
Pacific, brought word that when she left
the Shinano was pulling alongside of one
of the city docks, presumably to get
within reach of the local Fire Depart
ment.
F. M. Studley, Seattle agent of the
Nippon Yusen Kaisha, left for Port
Townsend on a chartered tug imme
diately on receipt of the news. He ex
pected before reaching that city to over
haul the tug* Pioneer, which is bound
down the Sound and which is fully
equipped for fire fighting." He carries or
ders for the Pioneer to render all pos
sible assistance.
The Shinano left Seattle on Decemb'er

a cargo of Great Northern freight valued
at 5400,000, consisting chiefly of flour, cot
ton, machinery and structural steeL

ously 111, his condition was not considered
dangerous. The Governor was known to
be a man of regular habits and strong
constitution, and although in one of his
advanced years pneumonia is never to be
lightly considered, it was thought that he
would pull through. It was to-day that
the first turn for the worse came. By
afternoon he was very weak and the end
was expected at any moment. He was un
conscious and therefore free from pain.-
He lingered until 8 o'clock to-night, when
he expired.
John R. Rogers was born In Brunswick,
Me., September 4, 1838. From 1852 to 1856
he was a drug clerk in Boston and for
the next four years was engaged in the
drug business in Jackson, Miss. He
taught school for several years in Illinois
and in 1876 moved to Wichita, Kans.,
where he was editor of the Kansas Com

Governor Rogers became a Farmers* Al
liance organizer. In 1890 he removed to
the State of Washington, where he was
elected to the Legislature. In 1896 he was
elected Governor on the fusion ticket and
re-elected in 1900. Governor Rogers was
the author of several works on political
economy, among them "The Irrepressible
Conflict, "Looking Forward" and "The
Inalienable Rights of Man."

STRIKE RICHES
Gold Is Found on Seven
Creeks by Northern
Prospectors.
Trapper Whos9 Home Was

Disappears.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Dec. 26.â Seven new and rich
gold-producing creeks have been discov
ered in the Koyukuk district since last
summer. This news was brought to Daw
son December 4 by. Peter Dow,' a pros
pector, who. arrived from the head of tho
Middle Fork after traveling â¢ thirty-six
days.
Dow states that the new streams will
rank among the best in Koyukuk camp.
His reports are corroborated by private
letters which he brought. The new creeks
are Hammond, Union, Wiseman, Noman,
Swift, Vermont and Vista. Pans have
been taken from Hammond Creek ranging
from $2 to $20. The other streams were
yielding almost as good results.
Dow discovered Hammond Creek, and
says the gold Is on bedrock at the ex
ceedingly shallow depth of two to four
feet. It lies In crevices and is worth as
high as $19 60 per ounce, containing nug
gets as large as butter-beans. Hammond
Creek has been staked for eight mlle3.
It has high, rugged mountains on either
side. The discoverers took $800 from Un
ion Creek in two days, including a $59
nugget.

only relatives reside at Lodi, Cal., per

seen since November 19. The day pre
vious he walked thirty-five miles on snow
shoes to Ahtmum for provisions. He pur
chased these and started back over the
divide, but was not seen again. Rathbun
had been trapping there for years. He
received mail at North Yakima from C.
W. Rathbun of Lodi, who is believed to be
his brother. Slight suspicion exists of
foul play, as he had recently converted
his furs into cash.
RIOTING SOLDIERS AGAIN WRECK,
Continued from Page One.
In the dangerous free-for-all fight were
injured. Lieutenant Martin's squad con
sisted of Policemen Attrldge, Baxter,
Maloney, Fenner and Brodt. Those who
came from the North End station were
Officers Butterworth, Larkin, Webster,
Dougherty, Lyon, Stratton, Cavanaugh
and Ottson.
It is the general belief of those -who pre
tend to know the situation at the Pre
sidio \that the casuals and recruits will
make another attempt to wreck Tarpey's
saloon and others In the vicinity. The
police will be especially vigilant, however,
and with the assistance of the military
authorities they hope to cope -with the
dangerous situation. In the mixup last
night many of the rioters would have
been arrested had not the mounted men
driven them into . the reservation so
quickly.
"A policeman can do more good help
ing to drive a big mob back," said Ser
geant Campbell last night, "than he can
trying to arres"t one of them."
David Tarpey stated after the trouble
that he was 'Of the opinion that the sol
diers intended to sprinkle his place with
kerosene and then set the saloon on fire.
This theory is not credited by the police.
TEND BAB IN ARMY BLUE.
The "front door" of the Presidio had
resumed its -wonted daytime quiet yes
terday morning, following the nrst riot,
and the official records at the post con
tain no evidence that a howling mob had
raged through the saloon-lined s-treets
just outside the Presidio eates. .
In the Police Court, however, there was
a different story. Judge Conlan convicted
thirteen of the fifteen soldiers arrested tÂ»y
the police on charges of disturbing the
peace. He deferred sentence till this
morning, and unless Colonel Rawles pre
fers to have them punished in camp Judge
Conlan will give them heavy sentences.
Colonel Rawles Is bitter toward the
Police Commissioners for permitting
saloons of the character common along
Greenwich and Baker streets to do busi
ness at the very agates of the Presidio.
Tarpey's place was only recently opened.
C. E. Ritter, who was recently refused a
license, has built a new place across the
street from Tarpey's and has secured a
saloon license. There are fifteen saloons
in the vicinity and at least twelve of them
are dives that are a constant menace to
the peace of the Presidio.
"If the municipal authorities," said
Colonel Rawles, "would suppress a lot of
these hell holes it would be a source of
great satisfaction to us here at the post."
. The existence of the dives licensed by
the Police Commissioners at the Presidio
gates is a cause of disorder that Is further
aggravated by a condition of things that
Colonel Rawles cannot charge to the civil
authorities. William Ross, .the soldier
bar-tender, who was the cause,^ innocent
or otherwise, of the ChristmaSr riot, serves
Uncle Sam as a private of the Seventieth
Coast Artillery and when he goes off duty
he tends bar for Dave Tarpey in the uni
form of Uncle Sam. David C. Tarpey, son
of the saloon man, is a member of the
Hospital Corps. He also tends bar in the
army blue and would have been in the
melee last night except that at present he
is sick i In the general hospital. He has
eleven months to serve yet, after which,
he says, he will become proprietor of the
saloon. The license stands in his father's
name only because he could not take one
out while In the service.
Asked if it were permissible for a sol
dier to tend bar when off duty, Colonel
Rawles said yesterday that it certainly
was not.
"The fact has not come to me officially,"
Colonel Rawles continued. "I heard of It
only through the papers. It will be in
vestigated and a stop put to such thrift."
Ross was not seriously injured by the
knife cut in the back and yesterday morn
tng he was discharged from the hospital
and sent back to duty.
Major J. B. HIckey, in command of the
four troops of the Eleventh Cavalry now
at the Presidio, yesterday investigated
Ross' charge that a corporal of the
Eleventh was the man who stabbed him
Major Hickey found that none of his men
was concerned In the riot and Ross ad
mitted to him that he did not know that
the man belonged to that regiment. As
there are cavalrymen'"' .among the'
"casuals," who were most numerous
among the rioters. Major HIckey is Â» con
vinced that the corporal who stabbed
Ross belongs in that camp. 'â .â â *
FILLED WITH RECRUITS.
The casual camp at the Presidio is near
ly filled with recruits and more men are
arriving dally. Several hundred new men
are also scheduled to report at headquar
ters before the end of the week. The War
Department has ordered that 750 soldiers
be ready to leave for Manila on the Sheri
dan January 1, so that the congestion will
be relieved to some degree. The officers
who will command the detachment during
the voyage are Major T. F. .Davis, Fif

convalescent camp on Angel Island, has
been ordered to take his men to Benlcia

discharged to-day. Maclay went to tho
navy yard as usual this morning and pre
pared to resume his duties. Pay Director
Putnam went to Maclay's desk, read him
the telegram received from Washington
yesterday and told him that he was dis
missed. Maclay left the yard immediate
ly. He said he would return at the usual
time to-morrow prepared to go to work.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.-The Civil Ser
vice Commission to-day notified Edgar S.
Maclay, the historian, recently employed
in the Brooklyn Navy Tard, that his re
moval from his position' at that point was
not In violation of the civil service act.
This notification Is contained in a letter
written to Maclay by President Proctor
of the commission, and Is in reply to an
inquiry from him. In his letter Maclay
asked these questions:
"First-Has the President of the United
States any authority under the laws gov
erning civil service to demand the resig
nation of a civil service employe in the
classified list?
"Second â Has the President the power
or authority to cause the dismissal of any
civil service employe without preferring
charges in writing and giving said em
ploye an opportunity in which to make a
defense?" â¢
To this the commission replied as fol
lows:
"December 26, 1901.â Edgar S. Maclay,
Navy Yard, New Yorkâ Sir: The com
mission is in receipt of your letter of De
cember 21, 1901. In response to your ques
tions you are informed that it is- con
trary to the practice of the commission to
undertake to answer hypothetical ques
tions. Your separation from the service,
according to the facts in your case as
they appeared in the public press, was
made upon the order of the Secretary of
the Navy, in whom the power of removal
rests. The demand for your resignation,
followed by your removal, upon the di
rection of the President through the Sec
retary of the Navy, was not in violation
of the civil service act and rules In view
of the well-known facts In your case.
"The object of the rule requiring notice
and a hearing was to prevent political re
movals or removals on secret charges. No
Issue of this kind Is Involved in your case.
Very respectfully,
"JOHN PROCTOR, President." .

Commission also gave out the following
statement bearing upon the case:

FRUIT GROWERS

Poor Railroad Service
Causes Wrath in
the South.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. SAN BERNARDINO, Dec 26.â The or
ange-growers of Southern California are
planning to combine for the purpose of
making an organized fight to compel the
Santa Fe and the Southern, Pacific rail
road companies to furnish b,ettec service
for the transportation of ; fruit , from this
part of the State to the Eastern: markets.
The directors of the Southern California
Fruit Exchange are to meet In Los An
geles to-morrow, and the exchange will
take some decided action In regard to the
matter at this meeting. Before another
week has passed it is . understood meet
ings of the growers are to be called In
every orange-growing section. At â  these
meetings committees will be- appointed
for the purpose of arranging with the
railroads for the furnishing of better
service.
. The growers at Highland are the most
active relative to this matter, and they
will undertake to arrange for the meet
ings throughout Southern California. In
the meantime representatives of the
growers I and the packers are making a
little quiet investigation, and in some in
stances the results are surprising. , ,
On Tuesday last 40ff cars of oranges
were sidetracked between Barstow and
Needles. The Santa Fe Company gives
as a reason for this that the shipments
were so heavy It was impossible to se
cure motive power enough to handle the
freight. The great losses that the grow
ers have sustained and are sustaining
througn a delay in shipping on the part
of the railroad companies has aroused the
orange men to a greater degree than ever
before, and the matter will not only be
fought before, the Railroad Commission
ers, but suits for damages are to be in
stituted against the railroads, and they
will ask pay for the fruit that is dam
aged in transit. For the next ten 'days
but little shipping will be done, and dur
ing this time the packers and growers
are to bend every effort toward devising
some scheme to compel the railroads
to furnish better service. -r

Is the Scene of a
Shooting.
The Slapping of a Girl's Face
Causes Quarrel Among
Men.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 28.â Word was re
ceived here this morning of a probably
fatal shooting affair at the Aiborgia ranch
at Point Reyes, in which Ben Alcantra
and Joseph Alborgi were shot. The name
of the man who did %ht shooting is un
known here and he is still at large,
though the Sheriff and his deputies are
making a vigorous hunt for him.
Last night Michael Alborgla gave a
Christmas party. Among those he In
vited was Alcantra, who is a Country
Club gamekeeper, and two woodchoppera,
whom he had recently hired. In the
course of the evening it is said that one
of the woodchoppers took . offense at
spme fancied slight offered him. by Oia
conia, a daughter of his host, and slapped
her face. The father interfered and grap
pled with his daughter's assailant. Al
cantra tried to separate the two men.
when the smaller woodchopper struck at
Alcantra. knocking him down. The wood-
Choppers then left the house.
After several hours they returned. Al
cantra told the larger man that he owed
the host and his daughter an apology.
This he agreed to and was In the act of
shaking Alborgi's band when his com
panion stepped up to Alcantra. and. fired
a shot through his abdomen. He fired
another shot, breaking Joseph Alborgl's
arm. In the ensuing excitement he made*
his escape In the darkness.
Sheriff Taylor was notified this morning:
and left immediately for the scene of the
shooting. Alcantra. was removed to San
Francisco. It is said he cannot live.
GOVERNOR APPROVES
COTJRT-HARTIAIi SENTENCE
Captain William Bruce of tne Stock
ton Company Must Lose His
Double Bars.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 26.â Governor
Gage this afternoon confirmed the de
cision and sentence of the general court
martial in the case of Captain William
Bruce of Company B, Sixth Infantry, N.
G. C, of Stockton. Under the terms of
the sentence Bruce must suffer dismissal
from the National Guard, and he 'will
cease to be an officer therein on January
4, 1902.
Captain Bruce was convicted a couple
of months ago of having failed to apply
to the requirements pertaining to the du
ties of his office the sum of $1421 38, or to
account for that sum as- demanded by
law and the military regulations, and also
of making a false return of money ac
counts to the State. It was charged also
..- at Bruce claimed he had deposited in
a Stockton bank about $1323 23, for which
he waa accountable to the State, when he
did not have the money on deposit. The
affirmation of the verdict of the court
martial by Governor Gage settles the fatÂ©
of Bruce In so far as his connection with
the National Guard is concerned.

SAMPSON" A MENTAL WRECK.
Wife of Admiral Says His Reason Is
Hopelessly Shattered.
URBANA, 111., Dec. 26.â John B. "Weeks
of Champaign, a personal friend of Ad
miral Sampson, has received a letter from
Mrs. Sampson, in which she says that the
mental condition of the admiral Is prac
tically hopeless. The letter was written in
reply to a note expressing sympathy with
Sampson in the presonaf annoyance he
has suffered In the controversy over the
Santiago battle. The letter says:
"WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 23. â My Dear
Mr. 'Weeks: Admiral Sampson is too ill to
really understand your most kind letter just
received, but If he were well he would wish
to thank you for it; he cares so much for all
"old times" and for anything that concerns
Palmyra. The reading of your letter shows
that living- in the 'West has not blinded your
eyes to the truth concerning: recent events. I
have enjoyed your expression of the true facts
as you understand them. My dear husband is
quite worn out with a long life consecrated to
duty. Physically he Is comfortable and happy,
but his brain is tired beyond ever being rested.
Sincerely,
ELIZABETH BURLING SAMPSON.

Tremendous Amount of
Damage Done in the
Northwest.
Special Dispatch to The CaK.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Dec. 26.â Between
J100.000 and $200,000 damage was done early
this morning by a storm which burst
thortly after midnight over the whole
lower coast of the mainland. The dam
age here was principally to small steam
ers, towboats and scows and also to the
cable between this city and Victoria. The
wind was the heaviest experienced here
for half a dozen years and af times
leached a velocity of fifty miles an hour.
All over the city minor damage â  was
done, chimneys were blown down, plate
glass windows shattered and roofs torn
ciff houses. So great was the velocity
of the gale that a large fir tree on the
English Bay beach was torn out by the
xoots crashed through a house. A
masonry wall protecting the beach was
hammered down and thousands of dollars'
damage was done to boathouses and small
tugs in the Fame vicinity. The cable sta
tion was wrecked by logs crashing against
ft and the steamer Aorangl. dragging her
anchor, fouled this cable and ruptured it
three* miles from shore.
In the inner harbor the three-masted
chip Elizabeth Nicholson drass<*d her an
chor and piled up .^gainst a wharf. The
tide was so high that the wharf was only
two feet out of water and the ship ca
teened until she had a li?t of forty-five
degrees and threatened every moment to
capsize as shte lay broadside against the
wharf. The steamer Active attempted to
rescue her from her perilous position and
her bow was thrown by a big wave right
on top of the wharf.
None of the ferry steamers from Van
couver l#land maae the trip until this
evening. 'when the sea was comparatively
calm. The steamers Kildonan, Halifax,
Reliance and a large dredpe were all
seriously damaged, bur no fatalities oc
curred. The steamer Mainlander, which
left Seattle last night for this port, has
not yet arrived and considerable anxiety
is felt for her.

Conductor Charles* King was killed last
night just across the line in Idaho. Con
ductor King, who had charge of a freight'
train, was blown from his train while try
ing to reach the caboose. King had been
helping a brakeman, and started to the

the bottom of a deep gorge, having blown
from the .train while almost in the center
of a trestle.

Disastrous Gale at Astoria.
ASTORIA, Or., Dec. 26.â The worst
storm of the winter prevailed along the
coast last night and to-day, doing consid
erable damage to property. During the
night two of the three barges used by the
contractors at the Sylvia de Grasse reef
broke from their moorings and were driv
en, against the railroad trestle in East
Astoria. One of the barges was destroyed,
while the other was badly damaged. The
total loss will it is thought reach $10,000.

Houses Are Blown Away.
SEATTLE, Dec. 26.â Thursday night's
storm did much damage and endangered
many lives in this city. Along the north
end of the water front, where wind and
wave had full sweep at high tide, . the
breakers washed away eight houses.
Floating driftwood battered these to
matchwood. The occupants barely es
caped. On Xorth Broadway a little cot
tage was overturned. No one was in
jured. High water on the Duwamish
River added to the complexity of the sit
uation. Wires are down all over the city.
The highest velocity of the wind reached
at 2:30 this morning was thirty-five miles
an hour.
Storm's Damage in Walla Walla.
WALLA WALLA, Wash., Dec. 26.â
Wind blowing at the rate of forty-five
miles an hour caused considerable â¢ dam
age in this section this morning. Tele
graph lines and electric light wires. were
tossed about and poles fell in dangerous
proximity (o buildings. The residence of
G. S. Bond caught lire from a live wire
and a small fire was caused at the home
of Allen H. Reynolds by the. crossing of a
telephone and a live arc light wire. Weak
ened by the strain of the wind, the barrel
flume leading to the power plant of the
Walla Walla Light and Power Company
exploded at noon to-day and a column of
water shot skyward under a pressure of
thirty pounds to the square inch. For
more than an hour steam spouted sixty
feet into the air at the power plant, and
it was not until a late hour to-night that
repairs. could be made sufficient to supply
power. The city is still in darkness.

President of Northr

ST. PAUL, Dec. 26.â President Mellen
of the Northern Pacific to-night author
ized a plain statement that he had not
resigned and does not contemplate re
signing. The statement sets at rest the
reports of antagonism on the part ofj.
J. Hill and outlines in concise form what
may be expected in the Northern Pacific
following tne organization of the North
ern Securities Company.
Reports that Mellen would resign
have been periodical for more than a
â year. Mellen .has disregarded them un
til to-night, when he dictated the follow
ing resume of the situation:
There is no foundation in the statement re
cently made- in. the press that I have either
resigned or that 1 am contemplating such ac
tion. The Northern Pacific Is being operated
independently of other railways now, as it has
. been during the time I have been connected
with it, and I have no knowledge of any at
tempt to change its policy or curtail the au
thority heretofore' entrusted to me.
To my mind it is extremely unfortunate both
to the .: railway. ..-. and- the public that
so much apprehension is being indulged In
regarding the Northern Securities Company and
-its relation to this property.
Practically .the same parties own its stock
as have for several yearn and no .more dispo

starter.". The association across the bay
will offer a suitable purse and it Is be
lieved the three will meet within a few
days at five and a half furlongs. All are
speed marvels, and it would be the great
est drawing card of the season.
From the outset favorites encountered
tempestuous weather. Rollick alone
weathering the gale. Buzzer, at 12, and
Rose of Hilo, a 15 to 1 outsider, were the
star long-shot performers. The attend
ance was large for a day devoid of any
special features. . â¢
Tom Ryan's Buzzer, a full sister to The
Pride, and 12 to 1 at one stage of the bet
ting, beat Cathello a nose for the four
and a half furlong two-year-old dash. The
winner outfooted Esternell the Hrst part,
but was dying fast at the close. Malas
pina, the favorite, ridden by Burns, fin
ished fourth, behind Prudence, a. 60 to 1
shot.
When the books chalked even money
and 6 to 5 against Afghan in the betting
on the six furlong selling sprint, "Frisco"
Lind, the gelding's owner, said it was a
shame to take the money. The price later
dropped to 13 to 20. At the start Tommy
Burns hustled the 12 to 1 shot Rose of
Hilo away in tho lead and was never
headed. The favorite Beaded McNamara
out for the place.
Hainault started in the six furlong sell
ing run for two-year-olds, sporting for
the first time the colors of Frank Doss.
He was well played at 4 to 5, and finished
third behind The Giver and Lapidus. The
latter cut out the running, only to be
downed easily by The Giver, well ridden,
by Ransch. The winner closed at 5 to 2 in
several of the books.
Nearly all the handicappers tripped up
over the result of the mile and a furlong
selling a/fair. It was iifrvjred for some
inexplicable reason that Diomed couldn't
go a mile and a. furlong. He scored hand
ily at odds of 4 to 1. Morinel made the
running for a time, then suddenly faded

home, I^ee Jackson landed Dlomed first,
two lengths before Artilla, in 1:53%. Dr.

favorite, only laid him low by a head in
1:2Â«?4.
Track Notes.
. Willie Buchanan rode a pretty finish on
Rollick, for at one time in the stretch he
wjis more pressed for room than a sleepy
tramp looking for an unlocked barn.
Howson rode a perfect race on Josle
G, which excellent effort -was deservedly
applauded by the crowd.
If the owner of Byron Rose looks out
for difficult spots to place the sprinter,
he Is an adept.
The long races Doublet , started in evi

I Weekly Gall, Â§1 per YearBARK MAUNA ALA SKIRTS THE EDGE
OF A HURRICANE IN SOUTHERN SEAS
Captain Smith* Makes Use of Oil to Calm the Angry Seas,
Thus Preventing Damage to His VesselâThe Master
Recalls Experience in Typhoon That Wrecked Warships
AMERICAN BARK MAUXA ALA TWO POINTS ON THE WIND UNDER LOWER TOPSAILS AND FORESAILS IN
A GALE. MANY YEARS AGO SHE WAS CAUGHT IN THE GREAT SAMOAN HURRICANE, BUT MANAGED
TO WEATHER IT.
p-+ jg"-^ HE bark Slauna Ala,- -which docked
â¢ at Pacific-street wharf yesterday,
| had a most eventful run from the
Jl islands. At times she was under
water and Captain. Smith had to
use oil bags in order to keep the craft
afloat.
The bark has aboard over 4000 sacks of
palt, a peculiar cargo when the loads of
sugur that come from Hawaii are taken
into consideration. This peculiar load has
a history.
Away back in the SO's a man named
Dousett started the idea that the making
: of sea salt by evaporation would pay.^ He
began work "on the coral reefs of Hono
lulu and in years accumulated thousands
of tons of the saline product. Then came
the reaction and salt was a drug on the
market as the Mount Eden salt marshes
on the AJameda shore had been discov
*"ered. These proved a good investment to
the holders and the Honolulu product was
a drug in the market. The Dousett estate
now wants to get rid of the stuff and the
Ma una Ala comes here laden with it- It
has lain in thd storehouses of the family
for nearly a generation and when it came
to getting the stuff aboard the bark picks
and shovels had to be used. Several other
vessels are now on their way here with
Vsalt instead of sugar aAd the price of the
former is sure to fall. In any event thou
sands of tons of the stuff that has been
kopt out of the market for years will
' come here on the sugar boats and thus
â¢ reach the regular market.
The JIauna Ala had a peculiar experl
.. e:ice in latitude 30 degrees north, 14S de
grees west. This was on October 17 and
about noon the barometer was down to
23.45.
"The wind was then backing from west
northwest to east -southeast," said Cap
tain Smith yesterday. "The ship was
down to lower topsails and foresail and
we were running about two points free.
It blew a hurricane and for a time we had
to use oil bags to keep the seas from
breaking aboard. We were then on the
tail end of a huricane.
"Back in 1SS7 I was on my way from
Australia to Honolulu with a cargo of
â¢ coal. We were caught in the gale that
wiecked the Vandalia and Trenton and
vcie in pretty sere straits ourselves. On
f;cccur.t of our troubles we had to put into
Tahiti for repairs and it took us quite a
while before we could leave Papeete. On
this occasion we only pot the tail end of a
similar gale, but it was just as bad as we
wanted. We will discharge our cargo of
salt at once and will probably go back
to the islands and bring up another load."

Returns to Port Disabled.
The steam schooner W. H. Kruger came
back to port under sail yesterday. She
ieft here the day before Christmas with
the schooner Lillebonne in tow. Both
were bound for Tiilamook, but during
a northwest gale when forty miles south
west of Point Arena the steamer and
her tow parted company. "While search
ing for the missing schooner, which in
the meantime had stood off shore, the
Kfuger lost her propeller and had to
put back to San Francisco under sail.
It was an unfortunate accident, as both
vessels were near their destination at
the time.
The Kruger is now on the dock getting
a new propeller and will sail to-morrow
for Tiilamook. She will pick up the
Lillebonne if that vessel has not already
made port.

The trouble grew out of a crap game,
the negroes having quarreled over the
winnings. Tom Hoiley shot at one of the
party, when J. â¢Bird, a white man, came
up and advised the negroes to stop light
ing. Holley, becoming angered at the in
terference-, lired on Bird, mortally wound
ing him. Bird's two sons rushed to his
siae and one of them shot the negro Hoi
ley, inflicting a fatal wound. By this
time the negroes were firing on both the
boys and they began to seek shelter.
Reuben Bird went to his father, who was
dying, and was ordered by George Woods
a negro, to run. .
TTie boy begged to remain by his father,
but on failure to move was shot dead.
Charles Woods, father of George Woods
then shot the elder Bird again. George
Bird was shot in the leg while escaping.
A large crowd of whites quickly gathered
and, surrounding the negroes, captured
them all and took them to Talladega
For a while it seemed as if a race riot
would result, but the qtiick action of con
servative citizens prevented an outbreak.

The Methodist Episcopal
Church Adopts New
Constitution.
CHICAGO, Dec. 26.â Announcement was
made here to-day that the new constitu
tion of the Methodist Episcopal church,
which was adopted at the last general
conference of that denomination, held in
the Auditorium in 1900 and referred to the
various conferences throughout the ctmn
try, has finally been approved by the
three-quarters vote required. The vote i3
as follows: Ayes, 8968: nays, 2231.
The element which opposed the new or
ganic law of the church because it pro
vided for the admission of women as' dele
gates to the general conference made war
on the constitution all along, but met
with defeat.
One hundred and twenty-one annual
conferences voted on the question, a total
of 10,709 ballots beings cast by delegates.
The principal changes provided for in the
new constitution are:
It gives women the right to sit as dele
gates in the general conference, gives
laymen's electoral meetings authority to
vote on constitutional questions and
changes the vote necessary in the gen
eral conference to amend the constitution
from three-fourths to two-thirds.

AN ENGLISH VIEW.
THE principal American opponents of a law to
recreate our merchant marine are connected in
some way with the British ship builders and
owners, and are concerned in the prosperity of the
British owners of the ships which carry the most of
our deep water commerce.
They have just been reinforced by an interview
given to the Cincinnati Enquirer by Sir Christopher
Furness, the largest fhip-builder and ship-owner in
the world.
Sir Christopher is visiting this country in connec
tion with his interest in copper properties, and while
at New Orleans in his pfivatc car sought opportunity
to make public his opinions in opposition to the
proposition to protect ship-building in this country
until we get enough bottoms under our own flag to
carry our own commerce. He said: "It could cer
tainly serve no useful purpose to subsidize passen
ger ships. They cannot be depended on to extend the
commercial relations of the country. To subsidize
them would be of*no use whatever to American
commerce. On the other hand, if subsidies were ex
tended to cargo vessels only, luch a course would not
be beneficial to commerce, and I think would only
increase the cost of freight to shippers by giving such
a large margin of profit in prospect that it would
encourajjc extravagance in expenditures and enervate
the business."
These views of Sir Christopher arc bcinn seized
1 upon as material in ih c campaign against nn Ameri
can merchant marine. Hut no one has so far shown
that they arc anything more than the opinions of n
gentleman who i* interested on the other side of the
question, lie refers to the cheapness of our steel
for t>hip-huilditiR and the advantages we have for con
struction. Dut the difficulty does not lie In the price
of material, nor is it incident to the mechanics of
construction. It is in the cost of operating Ameri
can built and repistcrcd ships after they arc built.
Even if we admit that our higher wages to ship
building mechanics do not figure against construc
tion, because of their greater skill nnd productive
power, the fact remains that in operating ships the
higher wages paid to American seamen do put our
merchant marine at a decided disadvantage.
The same issue is carried into the shipping busi
ness that prevails throughout pur industrial system.
The American wage scale leads the world and Amer
icans insist that it shall be maintained. If it be de
sirable that our flag float at sea over American ships,
they must have a measure of that protection which
has given us industrial independence on the land
or the first inroad must be made in the American
wage scale. We must reconquest our carrying trade
at the expense of the American sailor or by the joint
encouragement of the whole people.
In a recent address at the Franklin Institute in
; Philadelphia on the evolution of firearms General
Wheeler said that as late as the beginning of the
nineteenth century many military experts believed the
crossbow a more effective weapon than any firearm
then in use, and experiments made in England in
1/92 seemed to confirm the opinion. As evidences of
the slowness of army and navy officers to adopt new
inventions in arms he cited the facts that old-fash
ioned muskets were used in the Mexican war, and
that during the war with Spain our fleets were not
supplied with smokeless powder.
Not content with an insurrection at home, and im
pending conflict with Colombia, a row with the
United States over the asphalt claims and an ultima
tum threatened from Germany, President Castro of
Venezuela has picked a quarrel with France; and if
there are any other nations that wish to talk war
Castro will accommodate them.
In raiding the policy shops in New York recently
the police found papers which show that the'aggre
gate receipts of the. shops raided amounted to up
ward of $70,000 a week; so it will be seen the tin
horn gambler sometimes blows a big horn.
The society fox hunters of Long Island are com
plaining of other society folk who insist on following
the hunt in automobiles, and from that fact we may
infer what kind of fox hunting they do.

PROSPEROUS CONDITIONS.
THE Telegram cf Portland, Or., bases a sharp
criticism of The Call on this sentence, which we
used in discussing proposed' free trade with
Cuba: "It is as much as we can do.,by careful legis
lation to preserve the conditions of prosperity for our
own people."
The Telegram scouts the idea that protection has
any part in a prosperity that it ascribes to "the ex
tent and nature of our country, the superior, charac
ter of our people and bur democratic institutions." -
'As a rejoinder it may well be said that the charac
ter of our people is founded in the nature of our in
stitutions and the legislation necessary for their
maintenance. Suppose that after we achieved inde
pendence our legislation had been. such as to leave
the people where- Great Britain held them as colo
nists, compelling them to be producers of raw ma
terial and buyers of all manufactured articles from her
or other foreign nations, will any one contend that
their character would be what it is now, their quality
the same, even with the extent and nature of the
country and its democratic institutions as they are?
Even before the constitutional period which began
in 1789, the leaders of the Revolution saw that inde
pendence meant something besides and much more
than political independence. They saw that it meant
also industrial independence, the production of raw
material and its manufacture, both by our own labor.
The first â  tariff was passed by the first Congress,
with that end in view, and the purpose of all subse
quent tariff legislation has been the same. It has been
a system of legislation designed to supplement politi
cal with industrial freedom. Jefferson believed in it,
and Clay reduced it to formula and called it "the
American system." As our population has increased
the necessity for it has seemed to survive and be
more vital than ever.
No one denies that the resulting quality of our
people, their genius and initiative, have put many
forms of manufacture beyond the need of protection,
but no one claims with reason that they would have
reached that stage without protection. .
The industries that are now threatened by Cuban
free trade and unrestricted coitimercial intercourse
with the Philippines are agricultural..I'n some of their
aspects they are new industries. Thiejkdiversify crops.
They benefit all pre-existing agriculture by giving
land a new use. Every acre in sugar, rice and to
bacco is an acre taken from the production of cereals,
cotton and forage, and adds to the^^alue of those
crops. The Telegram says that: "Fair and just pro
tection is good in its way, but it is time to cease
making a political and economic fetich out of it."
* Will that paper contend that specific forms of agri
culture are not as much entitled to "fair and just pro
tection" as were specific forms of manufacture?
The Telegram says what no one denies, that "with
or without protection, with or without any particular
law or set or series of laws, there are periods of
prosperity and depression." No paper has more fre
quently or clearly stated this law of action and re
action than has The Call. But here again legislation
has something to do with the severity and duration of
the reaction when jj comes. Individuals who arc out
of debt do not feel hard times. Nations that are not
in debt feel them less severely than those that are
debtors. By the financial and tariff reforms insti
tuted by the Republican party since 1897 this has
ceased tc be a debtor, nation. We owe â nothing
abroad for manufactured supplies, nor are we bor
rowers from other nations. They owe us for sup
plies, and they borrow of us. The rule is a simple
one to understand, but its practice seems to depend
on some form of authority. The first protective code
that is recorded was given to the children of Israel
by Moses, and he clearly stated the above rule by en
joining them to borrow of no man but lend to all
nations.
The Telegram sees already signs of a business re
action. To do so needs no clairvoyance nor sorcery.
So in the depths of the panic that be^an in
i&J.l. and was prolonged by our status' ns a
debtor nation, the gift of prophecy was not
required to sec the end of the hnrd times
and the reinstatement of enterprise. The panic
was prolonged by the fact that it was n slow process
of liquidation of our debts. Another pnnic will
come, but the liquidation will not require ns much
time. We nre on a better basis. A protective
tarilT, sound money and less need of liquidation will
mitigate it, and to thf.t extent legislation will prove
to lie a factor in the prosperity of our people.
It is announced that Congressman Wnchter of
Maryland has withdrawn his bill to abolish football
fjames between Annapolis and West Point, and so
one cloud passes from the sky and the coming year
may be merry after all.
HIGHER EDUJATION.
ACCORDING to figures compiled by the Phil
adelphia Press the gifts to educational institu
tions this year will be in the neighborhood of
$75,000,000. The banner year for such gifts in the
past was 1899, when the total reached the sum of
S55.ooo.ooo. In the compilation of the Press the re
cent gift to Stanford University is put down at
$15,000,000, the estimate being that such sum repre
sented the increase on the endowment originally
made by the founders. The gift of Mrs. Stanford
thus ranks as the largest of the year. Carnegie's of
fer of $10,000,000 to found an institution for research
at Washington takes second place, and the gift of
Rockefeller of $5,000,000 to the University of Chi
cago holds third place.
The New England States get a large proportion of
the total gifts. Boston gets $2,500,000 to found the
Simmons technological school for, '/women. Clark-
University, it is estimated, will get about $2,000,000
when the estate left by the founder is' settled up.
Brown University gets $1,000,000, and Harvard and
Yale each receive more than that sum, so that even
were the smaller donations to the minor colleges to
be omitted, the increase of the New England educa
tional endowments would be notable and impressive.
The North, the East and the West have thus been
generously and munificently provided for during the
year, but the South receives little. That fact is due
of course to the lack of wealth in the Southern
States. When the South has millionaires it cannot be
doubted they will prove equally liberal in promoting
education, and fortunately the number of rich men in
the South is increasing rapidly. The manufacturing
industries that are springing up in all parts of that
section will produce' wealth for the South just/as
similar industries produced it in the North, and con
sequently the time is not far distant when the yearly
summary of munificent gifts to education will be
augmented by gifts in the South as well as in other
sections of the Union.
While we are thus rapidly increasing bur educa
tional facilities and' are congratulating ourselves
upon the fact a warning comes from Germany,
where higher education has been more widely dif
fused than. in any other country in the world. Dr.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY; DECEMBER '27, 15)1)1.
von Stradonitz of the University of Berlin, com
menting upon Carnegie's offer of $10,000,000 for edu
cation at Washington,- is reported to have said
Americans must begin to guard against the danger of
fostering higher education at the expense of the
practical intelligence of the people, and to have
added: "We are suffering from it in Germany. We
are burdened with an unproductive class who look
with inherited scorn on those whose education' has
been merely in the art of bread-winning. The evil
manifests itself in Germany, by the existence of an
idle element which, lacking, any other occupation,
serves the recruiting sergeant of the enemies of
social order. The fundamental feature of American
schooling as a preliminary fitting for men and women
in life's battles is truly the Darwinian principle, and
it finds a splendid vindication in the strength of
America's position in the world to-day. Mr. Car
negie's technical school endowments showed that he
was fully in harmony with the American spirit, but
his latest proposal I am unable to commend."
The warning coming from such a source is interest
ing, but.it is not likely to alarm any considerable
number of our people. It is true the endowments of
our universities are now very large and are increas
ing at an extraordinary rate, but the country is large
and the population is increasing. Moreover, the op
portunities to make use of the highest education are
abundant. It is going to be a long time before the
United States will have to complain of the "burden"
of too many learned men.
It is said the Presidential campaign in Cuba is
gradually working up to, a true American enthusiasm.
The rival parties have already begun to denounce one
another as "pig heads" and "traitors," and before the
election takes place the oratory may be quite equal
to anything our own spellbinders could do.
FOREIGNERS AND THE LAW.
HOWEVER strongly intelligent Americans
may be inclined to support their own country
"right or wrong" in a controversy with a for
eign power, it will not be easy for them to deny the
justice of the claim the Italian Government is now
making at Washington with respect to the lynching
of certain Italians in Colorado, Louisiana and Mis
sissippi. The claim is the simple one that since
Americans in Italy have all the protection the Italian
courts 'can give, Italians in this country should have
protection from the Federal courts, since it is the
Federal Government which makes the treaties under
which they come here.
In a recent statement of his side of the question
the Italian Embassador said: "In the case of Italians
residing in the United States the treaty assures them
the same rights and protection given to American
citizens. But, unfortunately, this expression of the
treaty, so far as it relates to Italians in this country,
is somewhat theoretical, for under the American sys
tem, which limits the Federal authority over States,
the central government is not able to give effect to
the guarantee laid down by the treaty. We fully rec
ognize the difficulties of this situation, which have
been as apparent to the statesmen of this country as
they have to those of Italy. We have hoped this
would bring about the enactment of' a law which
would permit the Federal Government to carry out
the guarantees of the treaties."
Under ordinary circumstances there would be no
sympathy among Americans with any effort made by
a foreign power to induce us 'tb; change quf system
of doing justice. We arc well content with our
method of leaving life and property to the care of
the States rather than burdening the Federal courts
with them except where the wrong done, is in viola
tion of a Federal statute. Upon the subject of lynch
ing, however, we arc likely to be tolerant of any sug
gestion from any source that tends to put an end to
it. Lynch law has now bfeome so prevalent that it
constitutes one of the most serious evils of the time.
In several of the States the courts are unable to ef
fectively deal with it. Consequently anything which
will bring a lynching gang to answer to Federal
nuthority instead of State authority will be widely
approved.
There is a show of reason in the claim of the
Italian Government that the Federal courts should
have power to enforce Federal treaties niul it is to
be hoped Congress cti'n provide some method of
granting the power.
MAROONI AND THE CABLES.
HARDLY more attention lias been Riven in the
East to the marvel of Marconi's dispatch of
a wireless message across the ocean than to'
the action of the Anglo-American Cable Company in
informing him that the company has exclusive rights
in the operation of ocean telegraph stations in New
foundland and that he must cease making his experi
ments there. The action has been taken as an evi
dence that the cable company recognizes a potent
rival in the Marconi system and is desirous of pro- i
tecting its monopoly in the island as fully as. possible
during the two years jt will remain in force.
Marconi has expressed the conviction that it will !
be easy to arrange terms with the cable company,
but in a good many quarters it is believed that not
only the Anglo-American but other cable companies
will fight the advance of wireless ' telegraphy by
every means in. their power.
Over that issue a warm controversy has arisen. It
is asserted on one side that should Marconi establish
wireless telegraphic communication across the ocean
the system would not be a successful rival to the
cables because of the length of time it take& to send
a wireless message and the liability of the system to
frequent interruptions and disturbances. On the
other hand it is said tht Marconi system can be oper
ated so cheaply it will be possible for the managers
to profitably transmit messages across the ocean for
one cent a word. It i? argued that such competition
will force the cable companies to. reduce prices even
ifjthey continue to hold the bulk of the commercial 4
business that requires quicker dispatch than Marconi
can cive. â¢'. . i^", s :;-v! r C
It will be seen that neither side takes into account
the possible and even probable improvement of the
wireless system until it reaches a degree of perfec
tion that it can transmit messages as rapidly as by
wire. That probability, however, is one that the cable
companies have not overlooked. At any rate the ac
tion of the Anglo-American Company has given no
tice to the world that it looks upon the Marconi tele
graph as a rival in even "its present , experimental
stage, and consequently the public will be justified in
reaching the same conclusion.
General Grosvenor of Ohio has introduced into
Congress a bill providing that all manufacturers of
cloth , of mixed- shoddy and wool shall tag it in
plain letters and figures showing the percentages of
the mixture. Tailors and clothiers are also required
to tag all garments. The only defect- in the bill is
that it does not provide that people who wear the
I cloth .shall also have it tagged.

FOR five hours yesterday afternoon and evening, says the
New York World of December 18, New York had the real
thing in the way of a snowstorm. It set in at 3:25 and
stopped at 8:23 p. m. and began again at 11 p. m. The
wind was northerly during most of the, storm, but by 10 p. m.
had shifted into the north and northwest and the storm center
had moved off Block Island.
Although the Instruments of the Weather Bureau showed
that the snow began sifting down at 3:25 p. m.. but few people
were aware that the storm had started in business until 4
o'clock. Then It came down In a good old-fashioned way,- such

CALIFORNIA CREAMERY OPERATORS
HOLD FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION
Important Addresses by Some Experts on
Subjects Pertaining to the Manufacture,
Sale and Betterment of Dairy Products
troJHE first annual convention of the
I California Creamery Operators'
I Association convened for a two
)\ days' session in the rooms of the
San Francisco Dairy Exchange,
40 California street, yesterday. Topics of
interest to the dairy and creamery men of
the State will be discussed by competent
authorities during the sessions.
There was a large attendance of dele
gates from various parts of the State.
President Henry F. Lyon of Alameda was
in the chair. William H. Saylor of San
FranciEco acted as secretary. Many of
the leading commission houses of this
city which make a specialty of handling
dairy and creamery produce were repre
sented on the floor of the convention.
Among these firms were W. H. Rouss^l
& Co.; Hllmer, Bredhoff & Schulz; Mar
tlnelli, Luhman & Co.; Hills Bros.; Brig
ham, Hoppe & Co. .
After the call to order at 9 a. m. Pro
fessor Leroy Anderson of the State Uni
versity at Berkeley invited the delegates
to inspect the dairy school, college of
agriculture and experiment station in the
university. The morning was devoted to
the tour across the bay, a party of some
twenty delegates availing themselves of
the opportunity. Several profitable hours
were spent by the delegates under the
chaperonage of Professor Anderson.
The address of the president opened the
afternoon session. President Lyon re
ferred to the history of- the formation of
the association a year ago. The member
ship then was thirty, while to-day it
reaches nearly 100, with additions coming
in every week. He thought the organiza
tion would be of vast benefit to the
creamery operators of the State because
of the Interchange of practical ideas of
the members which must result. He ad
vocated the periodical holding of scoring
contests in which the efficiency of the
operators in the art of making butter
may be shown. The speaker said that the
annual dairy output of California aggre
gated $15,000,000 In value, and that .the
association meetings would result in the ,
fostering of a spirit of fraternity and
good will between the commission â¢ men
and operators, promote the handling and
sale of dairy products, harmonize con
flicting interests and advance the dairy
operators of the State along the proper
lines.
Committees Are Appointed.
Secretary â¢ Saylor reported ninety-one
members on the roll and $262 30 in the
treasury of the association. The chair
then appointed the following committees:
Resolutions â Leroy Anderson, H. D. Glasier,
Thomas Hods-e.
Auditingâ E. N. Bell, C. F. Andrews, A. C.
Grossman.
Butter contest â W. M. Turner, George E.
Peoples, T. G. Kins.
Professor Anderson delivered an inter
esting address on the subject, "Scientific
Education of the Creamery Operator."
He said that without some scientific
knowledge of his business the dairy ope
rator could not hope for success. The
literature upon the subject issued at in
tervals was quite voluminous, so that
there was no excuse for an operator to
work along the lines in vogue ten years
ago. The purposes of the dairy school in
operation i at the university were ex
plained. The warning was sounded that
if a man had no aptitude for butter or
cheese making his time would be wasted
in that or any other practical school.
A general discussion followed, in which
the necessity, of making- better butter for
SUN PERFORMS STUNT
ON CHRISTMAS DAY
Sets Tire to Picture in Range of Lens
in the Ferry Build- 1\
ing.
The sun did a stunt on Christmas day
that puts San Francisco's climate upon
a high plane. Shining through a window
that was closed and being focused by a
magnifying glass in a large monocle
used for the examination of photographs,
the summer-like rays of the sun set fire
to a picture of Mount Hamilton that
rested on an easel in the rooms of the
State Board of Trade in the ferry build
ing. When the rooms were opened yes
terday morning the remains of the pic
ture were seen mainly in ashes under
t Y\ p f'J^^-^l
A series of interesting experiments de
termined that the winter sun had heat
on days other than Christmas. A board
was placed in the spot where the heat
was centered and there immediately ap
peared a black spot on the board, accom
panied by the smell of scorched wood.
This confirms all that has been said
about the warmth of the winter climate
of San Francisco.

VASELINE NO GOOD FOB HATK.
Dandruff Germ. Thrives in It, as "Well
as in All Grease.
A well-known Chicago hair specialist
invited the Inter Ocean reporter to come
to his office and see under a microscope
how the germ that causes dandruff
thrives in vaseline. The specialist said
that all hair preparations containing
grease, simply furnish food for the germs
and help to propagate them. The only
way to cure dandruff is to destroy the
germs, and the only hair preparation that
will do that Is Newbro's Herplcide. "De-
stroy the cause, you remove the effect."
Without dandruff no falling hair, no
baldness. Ask for Herplcide. It is the
only destroyer of the dandruff germ.

the trade was urged. One delegate said
the competition was too keen, thereby
causing the manufacture of too many
cheap qualities. Another insisted that if
tho quality waa not improved the East
ern butter makers would capture our
market. The necessity of a more diversi
fied education of creamery operators was
advanced as the only solution of the prob
lem of improvement. The market was
glutted with .second rate, butter marked
v.ith the best creamery brands, thereby
deceiving the public and harming the in
terests of the trade. With proper edu
cation this growing evil must eventually
bo removcil.
Thomas Hodge next spoke on the ques
tion, "How Can the Creamery Operator
Aid the Merchant?" The speaker urged
that the operators should visit the mcr
chants with whom they do business and
study the methods of shipment and i.and
ling of dairy products. This, he thought,
would educate the operator to the impor
tance of attending carefully to those little
details which go to make the success of
any business enterprise.
Need of Dairy Inspector.
"W. H. Roussel argued that an inspector
ought to be appointed by the State to in
spect dairies and examine into the meth
ods of handling milk. He urged that the'
attention of the Legislature should oe
called to this Important matter, in order
that the quality of butter now being
turned out might be improved.
After some discussion the matter was
referred to the committee on resolutions
with instructions to report to-day.
Professor Anderson said that the rea
son so much inferior butter was made in
California was because there was too lit
tle attention, paid to the handling and
care of milk and cream. Milk was al
lowed to remain for hours in unsanitary
places, in which impure matter was ab
sorbed, the result being a production of
butter not at all calculated to benefit the
health of the public or enhance the in
terests of the dairymen. If the milk and
cream were properly handled existing
complaints against our lacteal products
might not exist.
The closing paper of the session was
on the subject, "Qualifications of the
Creamery Operator," by II. P. Carpenter
of Los Banos. He held that the principal
qualifications which the operator should
possess are knowledge of his business,
cleanliness and cheerfulness. In the gen
eral discussion that followed the matter
of scoring butter was debated and it was
decided to score samples of butter at 1
o'clock to-day. It is by this process that
the quality of butter is determined and In
consequence its value.

TOO MUCH JOHNSON
..IN POLICE COURTS
Three of the Family With the Sarao
Christian Name Bewilder the
Judges.
There was a case of "Too Much John
son" in the Police Courts yesterday, and
three of the Judges and their bailiffs were
kept in a ferment for more than an hour.
Judge Mogan had a Charles Johnson on
his calendar who was charged -with bur
glary. . When the case was called a man
answered to the name, but declared em
phatically that he was not a burglar and
said he had been arrested for battery.
Three times the case was called and three
times Johnson made the same statement.
It began to look awkward for Johnson
till Assistant District Attorney Hanley of
Judge Cabaniss' court asked Mogan if he
had a Charles Johnson in his dock who
was charged with battery. Johnson was
taken out of the dock and proved that he
was the man wanted by Hanley, and was
taken before Judge Cabaniss.
About the same time Bailiff Walsh of
Judge Conlan's court asked Judge Mogan
if he had a Charles Johnson on his calen
dar charged with disturbing the peace, as
there was a man on Conlan's calendar
with that charge against him who had
failed to answer to his name. Mogan ex
plained to Walsh that he had a Charles
Johnson, but he had been turned over to
Judge Cabaniss. Walsh returned in a. few
minutes and told Mogan that Conlan's
Johnson had been out on bail and had
made his appearance.
"Where is my Burglar Johnson?" asked
Mogan, but no one could give a satisfac
tory answer. Finally Bailiff Hickey was
sent to the City Prison and Burglar John
son was found in his cell and brought into
court, and Mogan breathed freely, aa he
had two other Johnsons, P. B. and John
on his calendar and began to get afraid of
another mix-up.

west-bound electric car opposite his late
home at half past 7 o'clock yesterday
morning and almost instantly killed.

der at the time and was crossing tho

Mission, when the car in charge of Mo
torman W. H. Hobbs and Conductor
Keating struck him, crushing his skull.
The victim was 62 years old and a native
of Ireland.
Motorman Hobbs was arrested and
charged with manslaughter. He said that
Moore stopped near the track as though
Intending to let the car pass by, but that
when the car was only a few feet from
him he stepped between the rails, and be
fore the current could be shut off or the
brakes applied he was struck and fell in
front of the car.
Hobbs was released on the usual cash
bail of ?50.

When the case of Anlton McGilvery, the

ccny for stealing a purse on Christmas
eve from Mrs. I. J. Sears, who lives at

Cabaniss' court yesterday Mrs. Sears re
fused to prosecute the boy owing to his
youth. The boy said that some other
boys made him do it. The Judge dis
missed the case.

PLAYWRIGHTS
AND BALLADISTS
Punditti in Discussion of
Literati of the Past
Centuries.
The third annual meeting of the Philo
logical Association of the Pacific Coast
was held in the Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art yesterday afternoon, Ewald Flugel
In the chair. The.re was a large attend
ance and the papers read were profound,
argumentative and of varied character
and color. Professor E. B. Cla'pp, Uni
versity of California, read a paper giving
a full and complete statement of Pindar's
usage in the matter of hiatus, with a new
explanation of some of the cases and ob
servations on the poet's habits of compo
sition.
Miss Reynolds of Los Angeles entered
into the spirit of the professor's sugges
tions and took up several of the points in
a very able manner.
Professor C. M. Gayley, University of
California, aroused the interest of the au
dience with a paper entitled "JTresh Light
on Henry Porter." â¢He showed Porter to
be a neglected but important Elizabeth
ian dramatist, whose works he ventured
to predict would before long come promi
nently before the public again. Some
learned authorities had attributed the
plays of Porter to another of the same
name, Henry Porter, a profound musician,
but Professor Gayley combated the idea
nnd showed that they were two distinct
persons. Henry Porter, the dramatist, de
veloped realistic comedy â the comedy of
humor. The speaker cited, as an instance,
the dramatist's play, "Two Angry
Women of Abblngton." '
Professor Johnson, Leland Stanford Jr.
University, contributed a paner, "The
Fountain Episode in Chretien "de Troies'
Yvain." The first part dealt* with the
Celtic sources of Chretien's description of
the fountain of Barenton in Brittany.
Chretien's version was probably a fusion
of several older fountain stories. The
second part of the paper discussed the
source of the Loudine legend.
Professor E. M. Pease, Leland Stanford
Jr. University, read a paper on the sig
nificance of the different forms of address
in the Latin vocative.
Professor A.- P. Lange, University of
California, contributed a paper entitled
"Some Notes on the Sources of Delaney's
Gentle Craft," in which he showed De
laney as the most noted artificer of bal
lads in the reign of Elizabeth, also as tho
first English writer of historical novels.
The following named were present* â  '
Professors E. Flugel, F. M, Padelford - Uni
versity of Washington; F. S. Dunn, Univer
sity of Oregon; Dr. B. O. Foster, Leland Stan
ford Junior University; L. J. Richardson Uni

Runaway on Market Street.
An exciting runaway occurred on Mar
ket street last night about G o'clock, when
the thoroughfare was crowded with peo
ple and vehicles. The horse was attached
to a light buggy, which was unoccupied
at the time. It started to run between
Third and Fourth streets, and at the cor

CLAIMS DEEDS
ARE VALUELESS
Serious Charge Is Made
Against Notary by
Oil Company.
The Kern River Oil Company Consoli
dated filed suits in the Superior Court
yesterday against Notary Public K. C.
Mosebach and Martin Jones and A. Ros
enblund, his sureties, for $1225 and $2125,
the. prices paid by the company for two
lots of land in Kern County. The plain
tiff corporation claims that the deeds are
false and valueless by reason of the fact
that the original owners of the land did
not sign the deeds in the presence" of
Mosebach. as he as a notary attested,
and that the names of the owners were
not signed by them.
The original , owners of the section of
land for which the oil company paid $1223
were Mr. and Mrs. J. Winifield Pearson
Jr., Herbert Murray, Mrs. A. M. Porter,
Miss Ernestine Coughran, M. L. Temple
ton and Theodore Cashman. The second
lot was owned by R. J. Graf, John W.
Pearson, Mrs. M. E. Pearson, A. Francis
Hall, John P. Uhlhorn, Mr. and Mrs.
Jackson Saufley and George W. Pearson.
The deeds -were executed December 27,
1900, and according to Mosebach's certifi
cations the parties owning the land ap
peared before him and affixed their sig
natures to the documents.
In the suit filed yesterday the oil com
pany claims it was informed In October
last that the parties owning the land did
not appear before the notary and sign the
conveyances, but that the signatures to
the deeds were not signed by the owners.
The plaintiff claims that it has made de
mand upon Mosebach and his sureties
for the sums paid for the property and
that they have refused to comply with the
demand.
Corporations Sued.
George Nisbet is suing Joseph Werlnger
and the Greenback Chopper Company for a
one-fifth Interest in a section of land In
Kern County owned by the Copper Com
pany. He ojalms that ho gave Weringer
$2500 to purchase the land in dispute and
that the latter transferred it to Die
Greenback Copper Company, which sub
sequently pooled Issues with, the Green
back Copper Mining Company, a corpora
tion -owning the other half of the section
of land. â¢ Weringer obtained through the
conveyance of the share of thd land he
purchased for . Nisbet .. one-fifth of the
shares of stock issued by the companies,
and Nisbet asks .the court to declare that
the Weringer stock is held In trust for
him. .......
Buried Under Beer Barrels.
Michael Devareaux, a laborer in the
employ of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, was buried under several beer bar
rels in a trench on Eighth street yester
day. Devareaux 'was in the trench en
gaged at his work when a beer wagon
drove along Eighth street. The driver,
without any apparent regard for the
safety of either himself or others, per
mitted the wagon to run into the trench
The result was that a lot of empty barrels
got jolted out of the wagon, fallng on top
of Devareaux. He was extricated and
taken to the Emergency Hospital, where
Dr. McElroy treated him for several lac
erated wounds of the head and face and
contused injuries to his body. The shock so
prostrated Devareaux that it was thought
for a time he would die. The injured man
lives at 803 Harrison street.

DYING TEACHER
IS DENIED LEAVE
Board Learns Miss Mo
roney's True Condi
tion Too Late.
Miss Mary E. Moroney, a teacher in the
School Department, whose application for
a week's lekve of absence on account of
sickness was denied by the Board of Edu
cation at its last meeting, died Christmas
day at St. Mary's Hospital after a surgi
cal operation. At yesterday's meeting of
the board President Kincaid announced
that after the denial of the leave th3
physician in attendance on Miss Moroney
notified the School Director that his pa
tient was seriously ill and the leave was
thereupon granted by Mrs. Kincaid on
her own authority. It was not ratified
by the board, however, until It was too
late, for Miss Moroney died before it was
effective. . She was elected in the School
Department on February 21, 1S71, and was
highly regarded as an educator. She -was
an assistant in the Franklin Grammar
School for a number of years.
The withdrawal by Miss Annie E. Sla
van of her resignation as principal of the
Cleveland Primary School was read and
taken under advisement.
Miss Ruth G. Campbell, a teacher in
the Jean Parker School, made applica
tion to be placed on the list of retired
teachers.
The recommendations of the City Board
of Examination for certificates to be
granted to teachers which have been pub
lished were adopted:
The annual report of Truant Officers
Floyd and Cavanagh showed that they
attended to 218 calls. The report says:
Frequently tardy and unruly boya cause tlls
tubance at different schools. This has been
corrected by compelling punctuality at school
and lecturing the unruly ones. Many com
plaints of boys remaining away from school
have been received. Immediate investigation
shows a desire to work with a disposition to
attend niKht school.
' Grants Temporary Injunction.
Annie E. Slavan, principal of the Cleve
land Primary School, who has been a
teacher in the schools of this, city since
1S64, applied to the Superior Court yester
day for a writ of prohibition to prevent
the Board of Education from acting on a
resignation filed by her In July. 1901, and
â¢which she subsequently withdrew.
The resignation was to take effect !n
January, 31*02, but on the 16th inst. the
teacher notified the board that a change
in her family affairs obliged her to with
draw the resignation. The board, how
ever, she alleges, has taken no cognizance
of the withdrawal, and will, unless pre
vented by the courts, accept the resigna
tion, notwithstanding that she has
changed her mind.
A temporary writ , returnable before
Judge Seawe'.l January 3, 1902, was signed
by Judge Dunne.

The Copper Situation.
A well-known Wall-street authority says of
Copper :
"Copper has continued the dominating influ
ence In the stock market. Amalgamated shares
touched the- lowest point on record and after
v.-ai<5 marie p. partial recovery. The raw mate
rial declined to 13c and predictions are fre
qxif-nl that it will drop to 12c. At this figure
there is a liberal margin between the cost of
j>roÂ«luction and the selling price, and the Cop
|Â«Â»r industry. under proper management.
Might soon be brought back into a healthy ccn
cition were it not for the complications re
rulting from excessive capitalization, excessive
rrotiyctlon. prolonged litigation and blind pool
inetheds. There Is a large demand for copper
â¢with every pnrepect of its continuance; but -the
lolly of continuing production upon the oM
Fccle in face of a decline of over $20.000.<X>0
in exports In ten months Is noxv- bringing nat
i:ral results. Very likeiy the worst of the
topper situation has been made known, but
confidence has received a shock from which
it will take time to recover, and the financial
Josses which have been incurred have had a
distinctly injurious effect upon the stock mar
ket. Koluir.gte of Amalgamated Copper had been
â widely scattered, and the losses have come
liardest upon small investors, so that the pub
lic is not likely to display the same eager ap
petite lcr stocks that it did in the early part
at the current year. This Is a factor that v.i!l
Jiave to be taken into- consideration later 0:1.
Df. it will undoubtedly add to the difficulty of

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 20.â The bears in the
stock market beat a precipitate retreat in the
later hours of the day's session at the Stock
Exchange, and their eager rush to buy In or
to cover short contracts <Jevelopad a fairly
buoyant condition before the close. â¢ There were
some relapses in the 'more volatile stocks, but
the closing generally was strong and active
and near the top level. The volume of deal
ings showed a material increase over that pre
vailing for the last few days. The bears were
inclined to continue their campaign when the
masket opened this morning and they ef
fected a nuinbbr ot serious iniuads upon prices-.
But they soon became aware that their offer
ings were being absorbed ln a volume and qon
tiaence which sounded a. warning. Sugar con
tinued to be the leader of the market, but by
no means ln m overwhelming a proportion aa
of late. The " vigorous support accorded this
6Ux.-k and the success achieved in driving tne
bears to cover In it were important factors in
lunnng tiie general market upward and in
swelling the iien-.t-.nd for other stocks to ami
extent which lessened Sugar's proportion of
dealings in the market. The bears in the stock
showcu-grov.-ing evidence of acute distress ana
having over-extended their accounts, apparent
ly In the confidence that the recent exp*rience
M <^o:;i<pr wjms 10 L>e repeated in Sugar. Rumors
sot abroad that negotiations were in progress
lor latching up a truce in the trade war. But
whatever may the grounds of to-day's various
rumors, the shorts were thrown into a frignt
and rushed the price up from the low point
at 103% to 11314. The stock closed at 112V*.
a net gain of ti%. Amalgamated Copper, ehar
ins in the heaviness at the earjy market, also
developed a very strong tone, adding to the
sentimental effect of the rebound in Sugar.
The price rose to <7JiÂ£ and closed only a shaci^
lower at a net gain of 2%. The quieter tone
of the London copper market, reports of some
large takings by manufacturers, the strength
or: Rio Tintos in Paris, reports that an agree
ment between copper producers was imminent,
under the pressure of the fall in price, all
helped the advance in Amalgamated. The ac
tivity In the stocks of electric manufacturing
companies may have been connected with the
developments ln the copper trade. Westins
house was at one time up 17 points and closed
with a net gain of 14. The majority of rail
roads reporting to-day gross earnings for the
third week In December showed decreases com
pared with last night, and this was an Influ
ence In the early decline, especially in St.
Paul. That system, Louisville and a number
of important Southern systems and smaller
railroads reported decreased earnings. The
showing was> ignored apparently because of the
very high level of earnings in the third week
of December last year, which were some 11 per
cent over those of the preceding year and were
notably heavy in . the Southwestern region.
The Southwesterns. Pacifies and Grangers be

CHICAGO, Dec. . 26. â The wheat market's
activity began at the tap of the gong despite
the absence of cables, May selling V-iQKc to
%@%c higher at 82V4c to 82%c. Sentiment,
already inclined to bull>hness, was stimulated
In that direction by the " report of damage â¢ to
winter wheat in the Southwest. Lack of snow,
protection, it was' stated, had worked harm to
the tender roots. . A large demand sent May
to SS&esSJ/ic Sales from brokerage houses,
accompanied by the profit-taking operations of
floor traders, sent May back to 82%@82%c dur
ing the afternoon. At this â  point puylng was
renewed for both the local and outside ac
count, and the market closed strong. May %@
%c over Monday, at 82 %c.
The corn market was a rather narrow affair
In the hands of the local traders. It held Its
own until the late drop in wheat, when corn
gave way. May closing easy, a shade lower, at
67c.
The market for- oats was local and trade
small. May closed %@%c up'at 45%c.
Provisions were fairly active and strong. A
light run of hogs and higher prices at the yards
gave the market strength and prices advanced.
On the bulge there was moderate profit-taking.
May pork closed 32%c higher, lard 20@22%c
up and ribs 12%@15c improved.

WHEAT â The foreign markets were steady
but dull, as usual during the holidays. Cables
from Rosarlo reduced the already low Argen
tine'estimates still lower- to an estimated ex
portable surplus of 16,000,000 or 17,000,000
bushels. Bradstreet's weekly estimate of sup
plies was as follows: East of the Rockies, an
increase of 400,000 bushels; Europe and afloat,
a decrease of 1,000,000; total decrease, 000,000
bushels'.
Chicago rose from 82c to SS^c and fell back
â  to 82%c. At the opening the demand was
good, but it was freely met. The buying was
better, than the selling, however. Snow's bul
letin on the growing winter crop was. rather
bullish, as -it reported the plant small, with a
poor root growth, due to the dry fall and lack
of snow protection during the recent low tem
perature. The millers took about 300,000 .bush
els. The break in prices was due to the real
izing on fears of the Government report to be
issued shortly. There was a tip, however, that
the report would make a crop of or>(),COO,000
bushels, or. uO.OOO.OOO under the estimates of
private statisticians. .'Stocks at Minneapolis
and Duluth Increased COO.COO bushels for the
week and Minneapolis reported the car famine
in North Dakota distressing, the elevators be
ing brimful of wheat. St. Louis reported feed-
Ing to' stock larger than had been anticipated.
The Cincinnati Price Current reported that the
late freeze was apparently -harmless and the
situation was favorable. Chicago reported that
foreigners had been buying for several : days
and that the farmers were holding back their
wheat. â  .
This market showed no change on the spot.
Futures were higher at the opening, but sub
sequently fell back In sympathy with Chicago.

Butter, Cheese and 'Eggs.
The only change worthy of note was a de

23c was the top price. The Egs market is well
cleaned up as far as ranch arc concerned, but
the feeling is not over firm, as this is the
season when values are likely to tumble at
short notice. Stocks are too light for a de
cline now, however.
Butter rules firm for creameries, which are
well cleaned up, but dull and easy for all other
grades. Cheese. Is weak and quiet, with liberal
stocks.

STUDENTS EAT
POISONED FOOD
College Men Become 111
After Christmas
Dinner.
BERKELEY, Dec. 26.â Two students of
the University of California are in a seri
ous condition as the result of eating a
poisoned Christmas pie left for them l:y
some unknown person. Whether the pie
was poisoned as a joke, with criminal in
tent or accidentally is not known.
F. D. Lord and J. R. Hall, two mem
bers of the La Junta Club, at 2511 Dwlght
way, discovered a pie which they ha-.i
not ordered &t the clubhouse on their re
turn there for a late dinner yesterday
after several hours' absence. The pie was
accepted in good faith, and the' young
men prepared and ate their bachelor re
pdfct. No one was with them at the time.
as most of the boys had gone to their
honifs for the v.inter vacation.
I^ord ate the larger part of the. pie, and
became ill soon afterward. He rapidly
grew \vor>e. and at an early hour this
morning Hall, who was not no ill as his
companion, summoned medical aid.
Lord was removed to a friend's house
in North Berkeley this morning, and is
now believed to be out of danger. Hall'*
condition is much improved. Neither cf
f the boys is able to tell who sent the poi
soned pie or why. They lean to the the
ory that it must have been an attempt
at a joke on the part of some one.
Robbed the Mail.
Charles Boraigard was arrested la^t
night and charged with having robbed
ihe United States mall. He was dis
charged from the Central Emergency
â¢lospital at 6 o'clock last night and a
short time afterward was seen taking a
package from the outside of a mall box
on Market street, between Grant avenue
and Kearny street. He was taken into
< -ustody by Officers Winzler and Clark.

Among men Walter Morosco was ex
tremeiy reserved. With the children he
was different, and he was never happier
than when administering to the enjoyment
of the troops of youngsters tf> whom he
periodically turned over his 'house,
grounds and Shetland ponies.
Shortly before retiring last â¢ night he
wont to considerable trouble to find out
whether his Christmas arrangements for
the West Oakland Home had been car
ried out.
Harry Morosco, decedent s son. said to
dav that he intended to continue the
treats to children out of which his father
: got so much pleasure.

1 leaves one son. Harry, and two grandchil
dren, Elsie Melville Bishop, aged 3V6 years,
and King Lester Bishop, 2 years old.
Walter Morosco ran away from home
when 1" years of age to become an acro
bat-In a circus. He remained In the show
buÂ«iness until a short time ago. when he
' disposed of his Interests to the Grand
! Opera-house Company, of which concern
Harry Morosco is now manager. .
Morosco has acted In a managerial ca
pacity ever since 1878, when he touted the
Southern and Central States with a cir
cus. His last circus experience was with
the Sherman show, which he took to Hon
olulu shortlv before opening Union Hall
in San Francisco. This was In 1886.
â  His late home In Upper Fruitvale is one
of the most beautiful residences in the
State.

WOMAN SHOOTS
AT MASKED MAN
Sends Five Bullets After
Thief as He Flees
for Safety.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 26.â Mrs. George W.
Allinger of 1530 Court street greeted a
masked robber with a bombardment from
a pistol early yesterday morning. -
On Christmas eve the members of the
Allinger family were up until after 12
o'clock. While Mrs. Allinger was making
her way from a rear to a front room in
the residence she looked through a win
dow and saw a man outelde who was try-
Ing to force an entrance into the house.
Mrs. Allinger secured a revolver, went
to the front door and opened It just as tho
man was passing along to the gate open-
Ing to the sidewalk.
"Throw up your hands!" ordered the
woman behind the gun.
Up went the supposed burglar's hands,
but while t.hc-y were erect he kept back
ing toward the gate and suddenly broke
and ran. Mrs. Allinger pulled the trigger
of the pistol five times as rapidlv as she
could. The fleeing man did not heed the
fusillade and lengthened his strides until
he got out of sight.
"I was first afraid that one of the bul
lets hit the man," said Mrs. Allinger to
day, "and now I am glad that he got
away without being killed."
INDIANS ARE STRICKEN
WITH DEADLY SMALLPOX
TACOMA, Dec. 26â Missionary Carl,
who is living among the Hoonah (Alaska)
Indians, has appealed to Governor Brady
and the citizens of Juneau and Sltka for
aid In stamping out malignant smallpox
prevalent among that tribe. He states
that unless active measures are taken to
eradicate the disease it will also become
epidemic among the whites. Governor
Brady and Mayor Forrest of Juneau were
present at a meeting of Juneau citizens
held last week. It was decided that Im
mediate relief should be afforded, as the
Hoonah Indians are wandering from
camp to camp and are liable to spread
the smallpox. Governor Brady has since
sent the revenue cutter Rush to Hoonah
with everything necessary to disinfect the
whole village.
Juneau Is raising funds. Governor
Brady's talk revealed the fact that
though the Alaska Indians are the only
ones in the United States or her colonies
that are of no expense to the Govern
ment, there Is not a cent available for
their welfare In <such an emergency as
this.

SAW IRON BARS
AND BREAK JAIL
Prank Case and William
Kelly Secure Their
Freedom.
Mystery Surrounds Manner
in Which Escapes Se
cured Tools.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 28.
With a possibility of a life in prison in
mind Frank Case, who was awaiting trial
on a charge of robbery, sawed hie way out
of the Alameda County Jail and escaped
to-day. With him went William Kelly,
who was being held pending trial for
burglary. The disappearance of the two
prisoners was not noted by the jailers un
til late this afternoon. As soon as. their
absence was observed Chief Jailer Louis
Schoenau and Deputy George Taylor sum
moned Sheriff- Oscar Rogers and the trio
went. about to Investigate. â /' ,
They found that two half-inch iron
bars across the top of the south or Grand
Jury corridor had been cut in half and
removed. Through the aperture Case and
Kelly had easily climbed, reaching the
â¢roof. Then they pulled away a couple
of shingles and were outside the jail.
Tracing the tugitives down the outside
of the jail corriuor by way of tall vent
pipes the Sheriff and his deputies followed
the trail through th<i jail yard to the south
wall facing Fourth street, near Washing
ton. On tiie outside was stretched a long
ladder-like contrivance made of broken
mop handles and strips of cloth. It huns;
over the edge of the wall, dangling by ah
iron hook made from a section of a stove
poker. - \.
. This explained the way the men got
away, but the puzzle to the jailers is.
Where did the implements come from that
the prisoners used to cut the bars?
Escaped in Daylight.
The escape was accomplished, according
to the Sheriff's theory, between 7 and J)
o'clock this morning. Case occupied a
cell with Charles Merrill, who was jointly
charged with his cellmate with the rob
bery of a Chinese laundryman on Eighth
street bridge in October. Kelly had a cell
near that of Case.
The cells open on the corridor, which is
barred overhead. The bars are the only
obstacle to easy access to the jail roof.
Where Case got the saws and when he
cut the two bars is a mystery. It is sus
pected he did the cutting yesterday af
ternoon while Christmas services were
being held on the main jail floor. The
singing would have drowned the noise of
the saw on the iron.
When Case and Kelly were released
from their cells this morning at 7 o r clock.
thinks the Sheriff, they quickly removed
the bars which only needed a tap to free
them. Then they climbed through and
replaced the broken plecfes with dummy
bars of wood. Only by testing each over
head bar was the change discovered. As
quickly as the deceptive blocks were
found the way of departure was exposed.
The men took desperate chances for it
must have been daylight when they
crawled through the jail roof, scrambled
down the vents for thirty feet to the
> ard and then clambered over a flfteen
foot .wall.
"Case is a desperate man," said Sheriff
Rogers to-night. "He has served one
term for robbery and if convicted on the
pending charge v.'as in danger of suffering
life imprisonment. I am satisfied that
only Case and Kelly were in the plot, be
cause Merrill, Case's cellmate, could have
gone, just as well as not. He knew some
thing was going on. but he said to-day
after we found the men had fled that he
did not want t<} escape. ......
Second Jail delivery.
"The job was a good one, and the es
cape was clean enough. It was made In
precisely the same way that lour men got
out during Sheriff White's administration.
I am conducting as close an investiga
tion as possible. We have no idea now
where the saws came from. All of our
efforts are at present centered upon re
capture of the men."
The jailers have not found any of
the tools that were used to cut the bars.
The pieces of iron that were removed
were left behind. The Sheriff is con
gratulating himself that there was not a
general jail delivery. He said it would
have 'been easy for all of the twenty-six
occupants of the corridor cells to have
made thfilr way but had they known what
Case and Kelly had In hand. The Sheriff
has wired descriptions of the escaped
prisoners throughout the bay counties.
Kelly is 27 years old, and was working
at the 'racetrack when ho was arrested
on a charge of stealing saddles and blan
kets from stables there. He had been in
Jail since November 11. Case had been
confined since October 2G. He Is about SO
years old.

be corn that is corn to look at In Califor
nia after awhile.
The first plantation in this State ia In a
shallow tin dish in the west window of
the ferry building on the third floor. Some
kernels, as large as lima beans, were
placed in water, and in an hour or two
they had burst open and shoots were vis
ible.
"Ha," said the Senator, "we'll show
them what California can do."
Later in the day he explained that hÂ»
now wishes to have skilled corn growers
of this State who have land suitable for
the best results to try the seed, which
he will furnish to them free, and produce
record-breaking stalks that will do to
show at the coming exposition at St.
Louis. He Is satisfied that California can
beat the world with the Peruvian seed.
His-estimate ia that thirty feet is a possi
ble height of the stalk.
This Is as high as the tops of most resi

would take a fire extension ladder, but
Senator Filcher faces such consequences,
and all other queer happenings that may
result, with the equanimity of a philoso
pher or scientist, who cannot be diverted
from his ultimate aim by trifles. Any
farmer who wishes to grow corn taller
than his fruit trees will apply to Sen
ator Filcher for a limited supply of Peru
vian seed.

Some Old Names for Cannon.
As the use of artillery became more
common and the advantages of porta
bility and rapidity of fire were recognized,
guns, except among the Orientals, became
smaller, but of better workmanship and
construction. Inventors began to try
their hands at all sorts of Improvements
or attempts at Improvements, and in the
course of a hundred years or so the num
ber of different pieces of cannon, large
and small, muzzle or breach loading, was
simply legion. There were cannon, can
non royal and deml-cannon, three or four
classes of culverlns, bombards, mortars,
perriers, serpentines, carthouns, curtails,
passevolants or zemrantanas, basilisks,
crgues, sakers, minions, mojanes, falcons
and falconets, robinets, fowlers, bases,
slings, pert pieces, murderers, drakes,
aspics, double dogs and lagtors, to say
nothing of rlbadoqulns, flying dragons
and partridge mortars.
Kansans are "Jayhawkers," Illinois
people are "Sand Hillers," "Suckers" or
"Egyptians." ; h,\v

SOLDIER'S MIMIC
SCENES OF WAR
Anniversary! of Battle of
Trenton Elaborately
Celebrated.
Firing of Guns and Cannons
Makes Sham- Battle .
Realistic.
TRENTON, N. J.,, Dec. 26.â The one
hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of
the battle of Trenton was elaborately cel
ebrated here to-day. The auspicious
weather in the morning had the effect of
bringing out a large crowd, who lined the
streets along which the sham battle and
the subsequent parade took place. The
three forces of General "Washington, Gen
eral Sullivan and the Hessians for more
than an hour occupied the streets and
covered the ground that was gone over
in the original battle and a realistic pic
ture of that battle was presented, except
the suffering which* the American forces
underwent because of the cold weather
and the inefficiency of clothing. The sham
battle began 'near the battle monument
and continued down Warren and Broad
streets, the Hessian forces, under Colonel
Gilmore of the Second Regiment, retreat
ing and halting at short distances, % firing
on the advancing American army. 'Thia
continued until the surrender at two
pointsâ in front of the postofflce on East
State street and the other on South Broad
street. ..-..,
During the sham battle there, was con
tinuous firing of guns and cannon. After
the surrender the military was re-formed
for the" general parade, which was sup
plemented by more than 1000 members of
civic organizations of the city. In the
procession was the Second Battery of
New Jersey National Guards, consisting
of the Second and, Third regiments, under
the command of General Cooper. . .
The parade proved somewhat disap
pointing by reason of a misunderstanding
which resulted in the military of the first
division passing the reviewing stand fully
half an hour ahead of the^-second: or civic,
division. . ' â¢, â¢ ' ' < 'â  - .â :^'"''-" , .

jects. But in the eyes of the law there
is considerable confusion as to the neces
sary qualifications which outsiders must
show before they can be admitted to all
the privileges of citizenship. On this ac
count the home secretary appointed an
inter-departmental committee eighteen
months ago to report "upon the doubts
and difficulties which have arisen in con
nection with the interpretation and ad
ministration of the acts relating to natr
uralization, and to advise whether legis
lation for the amending of those acts 13
desirable, and, if so, what scope and di
rection such legislation should take." Who
is a British subject? The committee point
out that:
"To the common law belongs the funda
mental principle that any :person who is
born within his Majesty's dominions Is
from thfe moment of his birth a British
subject, whatever may be the nationality
of either or both of his parents, and how
ever temporary and casual the circum
stances determining the locality of his
birth may have been."
The child of an alien enemy born in a
part of his Majesty's dominions which is
at the time in hostile occupation is not a
British subject. Again, the child born
within the British dominions of an Em
bassador or other diplomatic agent ac
credited to the crown by a foreign sover
eign is not a British subject: The limits
of this latter exception have not been ex
actly ascertained.
The King's son is always a British sub
ject, wherever he may be born. With this
exception the acquisition of the status of
a British subject by parents rests on stat
ute law. A person whose father or pater
nal grandfather was born within his Ma
jesty's dominions is deemed a natural
born British subject, although he himself
was Lorn abroad.'
To the category of persons who are
British subjects by reason of their birth
having taken place within his Majesty's
dominions must be added those who are
born on board a British ship. Some doubt
exists as to the extent of this rule. There
seems to be no doubt, the committee re
marks, that a person is a natural-born
British subject who isâ
(a). Born on board a British ship of war,
wherever such ship may be.
(b) Born on board a British merchant
vessel on the high seas.
It is suggested that a simple rule should
be made that any child born on a foreign
ship while in British waters should not
be deemed to be a subject of this country
owing to this accident of birth; but, on
the other hand, an infant who first looks
out on life under the white and red en
sign, wherever it may fly afloat, ig appar
ently a subject of the King, though he ba
as black as ebony or his father be this
country's most deadly enemy.â London

PURE BLOODED CELTS OR
TEUTONS ARE NO LONGER
Races So Mingled in Europe One Can
- not Hope to Separate. Them.
Unobservant, â¢ over-scholarly petfple talk
or write in the profotmflest' matiti'er about
a Teutonic race and. a Celtic, race, and
institute all sorts of curious contrasts be
tween these phantoms, but:ihese.are not
races at- all, if physical-characteristics
have anything to do with- race.""" 1
The Dane, the Bavarian, the Prussian,
the Frieslander, the Wessex. peasant, the
Kentish man, the Virginian, the man from
New Jersey, the . Nor\vegiaÂ»,-.the Swede
and the Transvaal Beer are ganerallzed
about, for example, as Teutonic, wh'iie
the short, dark, cunning sort of Welsh
man, the tall and generous .Highlander
the miscellaneous Irish, the .square-head
ed Breton and any .sort of Cornwall-peas
ant are Celts within the meaning of this
oil lamp anthropology.' '
People who believe in! this sort of thing
are not the sort of people" that .one at
tempts, to convert by. a.Vset argument.
One need only say the- thing Is. not so
there Is no Teutonic race, and there never
has been; there is no 'Celtic -race, â¢ and
there never has been. ...
No one has ever proved br.attemp'ed
to prove the existence of such races: the
thing has always been assumed; they are
dogmas with nothing but questionable au
thority behind them, and the onus of
proof rests on the. believer. V
â Indisputably there are. several races in
termingled in the European populations
but there is no inkling of a satisfactory
analysis yet that will discriminate what
these races were and define them in terms
of physical and moral : character. The
fact remains there is no such thing as
a rationally cure and homogeneous com
munity in Europe distinct from other
communities. . ,_ . >-.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 27. 1JJ01
HOTEL MANAGER POLLOK RETURNS
FROM A TOUR OF INVESTIGATION
. â¢ i .
Sees Best Hosielries .of Europe and Favor>
Some Features of London's New Carlton
for the Palatial Hotel on Union Square
ALLAN POLLOK; WHO HAS RETURNED FROM EUROPE, WHERE HE
WENT IN QUEST OF THE LATEST IDEAS IN HOTEL CONSTRUC
TION AND. MANAGEMENT. PHOTO BY ELITE GALLERY.
AFTER an extended trip to Eu
rope, Allan Poilok, manager of
the San Francisco Hotel Com
pany/which is building the new
hotel facing Union Square on the
Crocker property, arrived in the city
Christmas day.
The tour was taken at the reauest of
the directors of the company, that the
latest methods of hotel management and
equipment abroad might be studied" and
taken advantage of â¢ In the â  construction
of what will be one of the finest hotels
in the land. During his six months'-ab
sence Poilok visited the principal, hotels
of London. Berlin. Paris. Dresden, Mu
nich, Wiesbaden, St. Petersburg, Baden
Baden Carlsbad, and went far into
Switzerland knd Italy and through the
Tyrol, Bohemia and Saxony looking at
Sneaking last night of his investigations.
Poilok said: * â  y
In construction and equipment there is no
hotel in Europe to -equal the American hotel,
yet there will be found many points In the way
of service abroad worthy of serious attention.
The hotels across the pond are as a rule much
smaller than we are accustomed to, and as
a consequence greater attention is given to
the details which add to thÂ« comfort of guests.
Hotel keeping in Europe Is recognized as a pro
fession and all the hotel keepers . there have
gone through a long and arduous apprentice
ship in all the different branches.
Mine was an Interesting trip. One of the
finest and by. the way, one of the most ex
pensive hotels in London, is the New Carl
ton which is owned and managed by RitÂ« of
the Hotel Rltz. Paris. The Carlton is ex
tremely exclusive. The great feature of the
hotel is the dining-room, and in this particular
respect it is the inttntlon or the San Fran
cisco Hotel Company to follow the â  Carlton's
methods. Whatever is best in the RItz estab
lishments we shall adopt. All our china and
cllverware will be patterned after the Carlton
designs and the coloring and general decora
tions of the rooms will also be from the Rltz

Supervisors Favor Improvement and
Discountenance Extensions of
Time on Public Contracts.
The Supervisors' Street Committee met
yesterday and' ordered the preparation of
an ordinance reducing by five feet the
width of the sidewalks on Van' Ness ave
nue, between/Bush and Pine streets. This
action is preparatory to tae proposed
adornment of the avenue by placing trees
thereon, a central strip of sixteen feet
being set aside for the purpose. The
Board of Works was authorized to ex
pend $1958 23 for the improvement. , â 
Frank Symmes, president of the Mer
chants' Association, addressed the com
mittee In favor of the plan, but requested
that the placing of statuary on the street
be dispensed with. It Is the opinion of
the association that property owners will
see the advantages of the adornment and
favor beautifying the avenue throughout.
The committee ordered the preparation
of an ordinance for the paving of Va
lencia street, from Market to "Eighteenth,
with bitumen, at a cost of $28,300.
A bill was ordered amended so as to
include pressed brick in the materials
called for in specifications for paving
streets. ' : . â¢ ' â  ~
Grades were ordered changed on rse
vada avenue and Waverly place.
The applications of J. J. Dowling ana
Fllnn & Treacy. for ; extensions on their
contracts to repaye. certain streets were
granted, bat they .were notified that no
further extensions would be allowed.
Westmore Appears in Court.
E. G.' Westmore, the boiler-maker, who
shot Hans Alverson, night . clerk at the
Montgomery Hotel. 2&7 Second street, and
Charles' Penne, barkeeper in a saloon at
620 Market street,- appeared before Judge
Mogan yesterday on two charges of as
sault to murder. He was .nstructed and
arraigned and the cases continued till
January 3. He says he recollects nothing
about the shooting, as he was drunk all
day. Alveraon's wound may prove fatal.
He was removed to the City and County
Hospital yesterday. ;,
Stole Valise . From Wagon.
J. Wilson. < alias Barker.- was booked at
the City Prison yesterday by. Detectives
Harper, and Armstrong on the felony
charge of petty .larceny, second offense.
He stole. a valise from a delivery wagon
of the Pacific Transfer Company last Sat
urday, and the officers found him with it
on Montgomery street yesterday after
noon. Wilson served a term of ten years
for grand larceny, and" since 1S95 has been
arrested fourteen times for petty larceny.
Christmas at Presidio.
Soldiers, sick and convalescent, in the
general hospital at the Presidio were not
forgotten on Christmas day. Dainties and
fruits were distributed among them.
There was a Christmas tree, in the post
chapel, and Santa' Claus -distributed gifts
among the children of the. post. During
the advent season Chaplain C. â  C. '. Miller
preached a series of sermons.
Kagal Stole a Bicycle.
"John Kagal was booked at the City
Prison^ yesterday by ; Detectives .Harper
and Armstrong on' a' charge of grand lar-.
ceny. He is accused of stealing a bicycle
from the front of the dental college, Mar
ket and Taylor streets, - last Monday,
which belonged to W. B. Corliss.
hotels. Through the courtesy of the proprietor
I was enabled to bring back designs.
While we have not yet named our new hotel
it is possible it will be called the St. Francis.
Speaking of the newly constructed ho
tels abroad, Pollok said the modern ho
tels of London he found to be a great
attraction to the tourist. Hotels such as
the Grand and Cecil, with its 1000 rooms,
were besieged, though the older and
smaller typical London hostelries still
have a patronage clinging almost affec
tionately to them. Traveling Americans
simply love them, for they possess and
offer comfort and exclusiveness. The af
ternoon tea is apparently an 1 institution
being much supported by the Americans.
According to Poilok it is a positive func
tion with them at "the famous .Claridge's,
where every day will be found an Amer
ican reunion, those present sipping the
refreshing beverage and chatting over
home affairs, political and social. Every
body who is anybody meets there, and
the discussions are of the most animated
kind.
The hotel manager had taken a deep
interest in British politics, and in speak
ing of the King saw his Majesty and the
.Queen on the occasion of their meeting
'the Prince and Princess -of Wales on their
arrival from their long tour around the
world. Mr. Poilok said:
The Kingr looked to be in grand health and
I cannot understand how at that time such
alarminjr reports should have reached America
concerning him. The Queen looked on â¢ that
day as lovely and young as her young daughter
in-law, who sat in the carriage beside her.
It was a source of happiness and deep satis
faction to note the strong, the undoubtedly
brotherly fellowship existing between the
Americans and Kngllsh over there. There are
but few families in England who have not ties
of blood relationship in the United States. The
intense interest they take in the welfare and
progress of this country was shown on the
death of the late lamented President. I can
never forget the scene of sorrow at the funeral
services held in St.. Paul's, when every foot of
that great cathedral was filled by a worship
ing and heart-touched assembly.
ALAMEDAN BOBBED IN
KEABNT-STREET SALOON
George Heinrich Knocked Down and
His Watch and Money Taken
From Him. â¢
George Heinrich, who lives at 2412 Lin
coln avenue, Alameda, was robbed of a
gold watch and $20 in Oscar Osterdahl's
saloon, 921 Kearny street, about 1 o'clock
yesterday morning. He entered the sa
loon and ordered a drink. While waiting
to be served a man approached him, say-
Ing he was a fighter, and asked the Ala
medan to "treat." Heinrich did so, and
the fighter began fooling with him and
struck him on the face. Two other men
also struck him, knocking him down, and
while he was on the floor he was robbed.
Heinrich notified Policeman J. B. Cava
naugh of the robbery # and he went to the
saloon. v The bartends, H. E. McMahon,
refused to give him any information as to
the men who assaulted and robbed Hein
rich, and was very impudent and defiant
in his manner. Cavanaugh reported the
facts to his superiors, and the bartender
and proprietor of the saloon will probably
have to make an explanation to the Po
lice Commissioners.
Zionists Hold Meeting.
: A' large mass-meeting- of Zionists was
held at B'nai B'rith Hall on Wednesday
evening, in compliance with a request of
the central committee in Vienna that such

the existing regime of Federal office
holders in California. They do not want ;
to be perplexed and badgered by appli
cants for office. It seem3 to be the Presi
dent's wish that no changes be made un
less the good of the public service abso
lutely demands new appointments. It
seems to be settled that John C. Lynch,
Collector of Internal Revenue, will re
main in office until Senator Perkins re
cords his protest against the removal of
the Collector.
The story comes from "Washington that
Senator Perkins brought forth a letter
addressed to him four years ago by
Charles M. Belshaw ajid other leading
men, in which Lynch was highly com
mended. The Senator, it is said, renled
these indorsements to sustain his position
in protesting against Lynch'e removal.
Lynch will doubtless hold office for a
while longer. He has been admonished
against "pernicious activity" in politics.
It is quite well understood that his offi
cial head will go in the waste basket If he
abandons his post of duty to meddle In
nominating conventions or permits his
deputies to resume political work for the
Southern Pacific Company.
So much scandal has been caused by
Lynch's superserviceable zeal In the work
of Herrin that his friends have advised
him to attGTid strictly to his official busi
ness and let the railroad do its own poli
tics. If Lynch should make another bad
break â and be again exposed in the cir
culation of bogus telegramsâ Senator
Perkins might be forced to join Senator
Bard in recommending the appointment
of Stephen Kelly to the Revenue Collec
torship. Senator Bard -is at hla home in
Southern California for the holidays. He
