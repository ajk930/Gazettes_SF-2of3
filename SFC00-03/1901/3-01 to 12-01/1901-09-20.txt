He was a man born in comparative poverty
and grew up in what might be called poor
conditions.' When ' the trumpet ct.lled In the
war for the preservation , of the Union he en
listed in the ranks as a common soldier. His
record as a soldier shows that he was both
modest . and earnest. We see him at the end
of the war with' the rank of major, turning back
to civil life and perfecting his education. He
gained a few simple friends and it Is beauti
ful to think that he was surroundÂ©:! by them
all through hia V.te. â¢; McKinley was a. just man
âa man who had the â¢ highest regard.. for a
pure domestic life and believed in- the sanctity
of home. This is a good object , lesson tor us
to observe. The true character of McKinley
was shown while he was In San Francisco. He

The â¢ question .that confronts us to-day ' Is,
"What: will' be the outcome '-of hla death?" Our
Modest and Earnest.
From all over the world tender .and loving
messages of condolence have come at this sad
time. -They are not mere matter-of-form tele
grams, but expressions of genuine sorrow. The
President had grown up and had been -looked
upon as a man of generous heart and loving
soul and a man of no narrow views. He loved
God and his last words were: "God's will be
done," showing that he was a devout Chris
tian.
â¢ Two weeks ago- the entire nation was startled
by the news that our great President had been
stricken down. He was loved by the North
and South alike, and we now have the pleasure
of remembering how affectionately he was re
ceived in the South in ; his Presidential tour

The next question that faces u* Is, How was
this terrible assassination caused? No sane man
can claim that this poor wretch is solely re- "
st>onslble for" the act.
Responsibility for Crime.
Back of that assassin Is an Influence that -
loaded the pistol and pulled the trigger. It
was an utter lack of respect for law. An utter .
disrespect for superiors Is a lack of reverence
for God. God says "Honor the King." Any
one placed in power should be honored. A
man who has the high honor to be exalted to
the dignity of President of this great nation
should be deeply respected. It Is our privilege
to criticize, but when we try to despoil their
authority and disregard them or treat a Pres- !
ldent with disrespect we are sinning.
If we look to God as our guardian. If we love
him as we should, we will soon find that de
grading influences of a certain element of the
press and of public speech will not contaminate
us. We shall then have reverence for those
above us and live happier lives.
Our President is gone to paradise and I am -
sure that if he Is privileged to be able to look
down and see that his life and death have been .
! an object lesson and that the nation that he
loved so well is better by -his martyrdom, he
will feel amply repaid and will be most happy.
when we are protecting him we are protecting
tire nation.
answer Is, we must have more protection. It
is hard to say that we must keep our Presi
dents from shaking: hands with the crowds
that throng to greet them on our 'public streets.
The dominant feature of our Government Is
simplicity, but times have changed. It is a
serious Question, this protecting- or our Presi- .
dent and keeping him from the public. ' To
every real Republican or Democrat It is a hard
pill to swallow, yet this must be done. ThÂ»
nation depends upon our President.- Our mer
cantile world, our I shipping Interestsâevery
thing is centered round our Fresldent, and

The favorite hymn , of President Mc-
Kinley, "Lead." Kindly Light." was then
rendered by a quartet of two male and two
female voices. "When this hymn had been
finished Dr. C. E. Manchester, pastor of
the First Methodist Church, delivered his
address, which read as follows: :
Our President is dead. The silver cord ' Is
loosed. The golden bowl is broken. The pitcher
is broken at the fountain. The wheel Is broken
at the cistern. Tha mourners go about the
streets. One voice Is heard â a wall of sorrow
from all the lands, for the beauty of Israel Is
slain upon the : high- places. -How are the
mighty fallen!

pleasant hast, thou been unto me.
Our President Js dead. AVe can hardly be

seemed that our hopes were to be realized and
our pYayers answered., when the emotion of
Joy was changed to one- of grave apprehen
sion. Still we waited, for we said. "It may be
that God will be . gracious and merciful unto
us."- It seemed to us that it must be his will
to spare the. life -of one so well -beloved and
so much , needed. - Thus alternating between
hope and fear the weary hours passed on -Then
came the tidings of defeated science, of the
failure of love and prayer to hold its object to
the earth. We seemed to hear the faintly ut
tered words: "Good-by all, good-by. It's God's
way. His will be done," and then,' "Nearer,
My.- God, to Thee." So," nestling nearer to his
God, he passed out into unconsciousness,
skirted the dark shores of the sea of death for
a time and then passed on to be at rest.
"A voice Is heard; on earth of kinsfolk
weeping: . . -

CANTON*. Sept. 19.â With ma
jestic solemnity, surrounded
by his countrymen and his
townspeople. In the presence
of the President of the
United States, the Cabinet,
Justices of the United States
Supreme Court, Senators and Representa

tary and naval establishments, the Gov
ernors of States and a great concourse of
people who bad known and loved him, all
that is mortal of the third President to
fa^I by an assassin's bullet was committed
to the grave. It was a si>ectacle of
mournful grandeur. Canton ceased to be
a town and swelled to the proportions of
a great city. From every city and, ham
let in Ohio, from the remote corners of
the South and from, the Hast and West,
the human tide flowed into the town until
100,000 people were within its gates, here
to pay their last tribute to the fallen
chief.
The final scenes at the First Methodist
Church where the funeral service was
held and at the beautiful Westlawn
Cemetery, where the body was consigned
to a. vault, were simple and impressive. .
The service at the church consisted of a
brief oration, prayers by the ministers of
three denominations and singing by aquar
let. The body was then taken to West
'awn Cemetery and placed In a receiving
vault pending the time when it will be
ihiallv laid to rest beside the dead chil
dren," who were buried years ago. The
luneral procession was very Imposing and
included not only the- representatives of
the army and navy of the United States,
but the entire military strength of the
Sta.tÂ» of Ohio and hundreds of civic, fra
ternal and other organizations. It was
t -^3n<5 n of C th8 most pathetic features of the
day was the absence of Mrs. McKinley

The speaker spoke feelingly of the dead
President's devotion to his wife, of his
policies, the conception of which stamped
him as a man of genius, and whose worth,
gauged by the standards before him, will
be duly recognized by future generations.
The service closed- with tho singing of
"Nearer, My God, to Thee, "â¢' and prayer
by Rev. Father Rlordan.. Â¦ :
men dare to assail the flag, how quick are we
to rise up in anger and resentment. Â¦ And yet
we permit men to assail our President, who
represents the spirit of our Government! "Why,
then, should not our anger be as quick to rise
when the President is attacked? Oh, let us
thrust back these -detainers from the darkness
whence they sprung!
In this day of national mourning: we have
not far to seek for the cause of this great dis
aster. It is .the -Infamous action of Infamous
anarchy. Sensational newspapers Â¦ have not
spared the victim of anarchy.- for in the past
they, have held him up to ridicule, criticized
him with viciousness, and poisoned the minds
of certain beings against the -man- in- whom
was embodied the majesty of government. The
death of President McKlnley should teach us
this great lesson, namely, . that . the majesty of
the President of the United States is as sacred
as the majesty of the flag of our country be
fore which all must bow with respect. ,\Vh*n
Victim of Infamous Anarchy.
To-day the voices of men and women
throughout the land are hushed, and traffic is
stilled. Mourners walk the streets everywhere
sad and disconsolate over the national loss of
a noble man and Christian. â¢ We grieve over
him who was smitten in his strong manhood;
who was removed . from his . field of usefulness
before his time. President McKlnley . was a
man of prayer, and a Christian who . partook
of the sacrament regularly. That he was kind
hearted and merciful was manifested when
violence was shown to* his assassin; he said.
"Don't hurt -him." His calm resignation in
the hour of death was shown by the utterance
of those immortal words, "Let God'a will, not
ours, be done." His death â¢Â¦ reveals to us on
one hand the exceeding einfulness of sin, i and
on the other the nobility of a, true Christian
character. The President died not In vain, for
his noble works and example will survive him
long. . i â¢Â¦Â¦â¢_.
The closing address was by Rev. George
B. Hatch.- It was a masterly effort. He
scored anarchy and the sensational press,
which, he declared, was responsible for
tho death of the President He said, in

When President Wheeler closed the
audience sang- "Jesus, Lover of My Soul,"
cr.e of the favorite hymns of the dead
executive. Rev. C. K. Jenness then
spoke of tho religious side of President
McKinley's character. He said In part:
He Is cone from among us. His public acts
and policies have passed to their long hear
ing- before the grave tribunal of history. There
wÂ« leave them. We know he was a man who
loved his country, who gave himself unstlnt
lngly to Us service. We know that under his
rule the land prospered, that the nation en
tered upon larger tasks which opened before it,
and gained for itself and the principles upon
which it was founded a larger hearing in the
courts of the world. But to-day It Is the man
himself who is In our thought, and we know
that in him we and all humanity have lost a

BERKELEY, Sept. 19. - The
memorial service for the
martyred President William
McKlnley. held by the people
and churches of Berkeley In
conjunction with the State
University, attracted a very
large assemblage to the Harmon Gym
nasium in the university grounds this
morning. The fact that at the very mo
ment the service began the body of the
Icte President wsls being borne to Its last
' retting place cast a gloom over the vast
audience and evidences of the deepest
emotion were observed at every hand.
The gymnasium was tastefully deco
. rated In purple and sable. The speakers'
platform was banked with palms and
flowers, in the midst of which a draped
picture of the dead President -was placed.
: The sweet aroma of the magnolia mingled
with the scent of begonias and filled the
air with rare fragrance. Seated on the
I stage were President Benjamin Ide
IV heeler and the corps of university pro
fessors, together with the clergy and
â¢ representative citizens of Berkeley.
Among the latter were Rev. George E.
: Swan of St. Mark's Episcopal Church,
Rev. Hiram Van Kirk of the Berkeley
Bitle Seminary, Rev. Father Rlordan of
Et. Joseph's Catholic Church, Rev. J. K.
McLean.-presldent of the Pacific Theologi
: cal Seminary; Rev. Dr. Hosmer of the
"Unitarian Church, Rev. Mrs. Rebecca
ICuylor of the Friends* Church. Warring
Wilkinson, superintendent of the Deaf and
. Dumb and Blind Asylum, and many
others. It was a solemn gathering and
inpressiveness was lent to the scene by
the tolling of the, college bell during the
6?rvicc.
The service began with Scriptural read
ing and prayer by Rev. George E. Swan.
Tills was followed by the singing- of Presi
dent McKinley's favorite hymn, "Lead,
Kindly Light." by the vested choir of St
Mark's Church, singers of other churches
and the young women of the University
Choral societies. W. B. King presided at
the organ and Clinton R. Morse directed
the music. At the close of the hymn
President Wheeler delivered a memorial
address, in -which hÂ« said in part:
Most Beloved of Men.
We are assembled here as members of the
richest, freest, most progressive nation that
is or ever has been upon the earth, and we
an come to mourn the loss of our great father
and head, who was the kindliest, the wisest,
the mort beloved of men. Again has the ardor
cf a crcat public grief fused all our loves Into
one common loyalty: Again has the bearing of
a. common pain blurred the lines of party and
creed, section and race, and piled higher that
hidden treasure of â¢ loei which as a common
wealth beyond the veil blnda us In kinship and
Â¦ love.
Of all men who ever sat In the chair of
high authority, none has come nearer .to a
true understanding of the people's will than
. this man whose death we mourn to-day; none
was more faithful to execute It The source
of his power to know his people must, I think,
be identified with his rare endowment - of
human sympathy. He was naturally and spon
taneously Interested In his fellow-men, and
that singly quite as well as collectively. It
â¢ was no tur<Jtn to him to give any plain man a
: hearing. He was easy of access: men talked
t freely with him, because he showed interest
jln them; he gathered from them not crude ln
j formation merely, but that priceless thing, the
\ point of view. He was a friend of man and
\ * trWnd of men. {To no rufferlcr. to no In-
Nations as well as individuals have their days
of grief, as well as their, days of joy. Grief Is
not a new thing to this republic. It has seen
more than one of Its chief magistrates go down
to a'martyr's grave.' But to-day , our sorrow Is
peculiarly intense. He whom we mourn was
not-only among the greatest of our Presidents,
but one of the greatest of our men. His private
life was an example. ''His public life was an
inspiration.. He fell a; victim, not to external
force, nor to Internal sedition.- He Is a victim
of doctrines that . seek the destruction - of all
government, that stand to pull down what
the wisdom of centuries has built up. - ;
At the Church of the Immaculate Con
ception . the Rev. Dr. Morrison preached
the sermon. He said: Â» : .
During the mass music was rendered by
the children's choir of St. Patrick's. Pu
pils of the convent and Christian Broth
ers' School: were, â¢Â¦ after participating;- In
the memorial mass, given a holiday. â¢
All authority, civil Included, comes from
God. All lawfully chosen rulers are the earth
ly representatives of this authority. In dis
obeying and belittling our lawful rulers wÂ« are
disobeying and belittling God and sinning
grievously. Disrespect for the law breeds dis
respect for the law-giver and both are sources
of anarchy. When man neither loves nor fears

mass was said. The congregation was a
large and representative one. Rev. J. B.

out of town, his- assistant. Rev.' James
Kiely, officiated. Prior to the mass prop
er . Father Kiely explained the Catholic
teaching regarding the civil authority and
obedience to the same. Father Kiely- In

In every land there is a threefold relationship
of authority, obedience and brotherhood, found

The lesson of to-day is one that I might say
we need every dayâ that we must not be too
anxious for the worldly things. It is the
history of nations that they cannot survive
where there -is no- love or religion. Institutions
cannot live without God. The liberty we fought
for would not have been ours but. that It was
grounded upon the love and knowledge of God.

we might ask for rest and peace for the de

history was there such a general suspen
sion of business. Even the Chinese closed
all their games of chance. The city was
appropriately, garbed in. morning and the
flags everywhere were flying at half-mast.
Impressive services were held this fore
noon in all the churches and at the State
Normal School, while thousands gathered
in St. James Park in the early afternoon
to listen to the public memorial exercises
arranged by the general committee. The
stand was substantially the same as that
from which the martyred President spoke
on the occasion of his visit here last May,
and the same chair in which he sat was
draped In mourning "and occupied the
place of honor. ..The services were solemn
and appropriate. E. A. Hayes presided
and fitting eulogies were delivered by the
Rev. Father Kenna of San Jose, president
of Santa Clara College, and the Rev. Eli
McCllsh. president of the University of

Its display of shoddy and greed, and intensified
by the cold, hard selfishness which underlies
the power of the trust. . All these people, mo
nopolists, social leaders, walking delegates,
agitators, sensationalists, dreamers, are alien
to our ways, outside the scope of our democ
racy and enemies to good citizenship.
The real Americans, trying to live their lives
In their own way, saving a'little of their earn
ings and turning the rest Into education and
enjoyment have many grievances "In these days
of grasping trusts and lawless unions. But
of such free Americans our country is made.
They are the 1 peopfe, not the trusts or the
unions, nor their sensational go-betweens. This
Is their government, and the government of the
people, by the people and for the people shall
not perish from the earth. This is the people's
Presidentâ our Presidentâ who was killed and
It is ours to avenge him. Not by lynch law
or a large or small scale may we do It, not
by anarchy or despotism, not by the destruc
tion of all who call themselves anarchists, not
by abridging freedom of â¢ the press nor by
checking freedom of speech. Those who would
wreak lawless vengeance on the anarchists are
themselves anarchists and makers of anarch
ists.
Laws Enough. Already.
We have laws enough already without mak
ing more for men to break. Let us get a
little closer to the higher law. Let us respect
our own rights "and those of our neighbor a
little better. Let â¢ us cease to tolerate sensa
tional falsehood about our neighbors, or vulgar
abuse of those In power. If Â¦ we have bad
rulers let us change them peacefully. Let us
put an end to every form of Â¦ Intimidation
wherever practiced. The cause that depends
upon hurling rocks or epithets, on clubbing
teamsters or â¢ derailing trains cannot be a
good cause. Even If originally m the right,
the act of violence' puts the 1 partisans of such
a cause In the wrong. No free man ever needs
to do such things as these. For the final mean
ing of democracy is peace on earth, good will
toward men. When we stand for justice
among ourselves we can demand â¢ Justice of
the monopolistic trust. When . we attack it
with clear vision and cool speech we, shall
find the problem of combination for monopoly
not greater . than any other. And large or

made a few very appropriate remarks, the
main address being delivered by S. J.
Duckworth. The clergymen of the town
and the City Council also took part in the

over the town and bells were tolled during
the hour of the memorial services.
MONTEREY, Sept. 19.â Never before in
her history has Monterey paid such a
tribute to living or dead as that which
to-day was laid at the bier of President
McKinley. For thirty-six hours no busi
ness of any kind has been or will be car
ried on in town, signs of mourning are
everywhere and deepest quiet reigns. The
memory of the late President's visit to
Monterey last May and his great-hearted
and brotherly words to its people is still
fresh in the minds of all and no sincerer
sorrow is felt anywhare in the nation
than that manifested here to-day. The
memorial ceremonies were somewhat elab
orate and very Impressive. At 9 a. m. a
solemn votive mass was celebrated at San
Carlos Catholic Church, followed by an
eloquent sermon by the Rev. Father R.
M. Mestres. After the sermon the regu
lar prayers of the church for the author
ities of the nation were offered.

Dr. H. Chetwood, preached a sermon from

bitter in his denunciation of anarchy and
all that fosters and abets it.

Tears were shed and words said as If for

the town all day, broken only for a while
this morning by the tolling bells. All the
shops were closed and very few people

The Rev. C. M. Westlake and other

forbidden the papers claiming to be re

abused public men and taught anarchy,
to be .left at his home. No respectable
person, he said, should read or patronize
any yellow journal which referred to pub

chy and mischief. He hoped that the
law would make the owners accessory to
e>uch murders as that of President IMc-
Kinley.

which he claimed to be like a hydra

PRESIDENT JORDAN AND SCENES AT STANFORD.
It is not theoretical anarchism or socialism
or any other "Ism" which Is responsible for
this. Many of the gentlest spirits in the world
to-day call themselves anarchists, because they
look forward to the time when personal meek
ness shall take the place of all statute. The
gentle anarchism of the ootimlstlc philosopher
is not that which confronts us to-day. It . Is
the anarchy of destruction, the hatred of class
for class, a hatred that rests only on dis
torted imagination, for, after all Is said, there
are no classes In .America. It is the hatred
imported from the old world, excited by walk-
Ing delegates whose purpose It is to carry a
torch through society, fanned by agitators of
whatever sort, unpractical dreamers or con
scienceless scoundrels, exploited in the news
papers, abetted by so-called high society with
Where Responsibility Lies.
The gospel of discontent has no place within
our republic. .It is true, as has often been said,
that discontent is the cause of human prog
ress. It is truer still, as Mr. John P. Irish
has lately pointed out. that discontent may be
good or bad, according to its relation to the
Individual man. ' There is a noble discontent
which a man turns against himself. It leads
the man who falls to examine his own weak
nesses to make the reeded repairs in himself,
then to take up the struggle again. There is
a cowardly discontent which leads the man to
blame all failure on' his prosperous neighbor or
on society at large, as if a social system ex
isted apart from the men who make it. This
is the sort of discontent to which the agitator
appeals, that finds its stimulus in sensational
Journalism. It is that which feeds the frenzy
of the assassin who would work revenge on
society by destroying Its accepted head.
The journal for weak-minded . and debased
makes heroes of those of Its class who carry
folly into crime. The half-crary egotist im*
agines himself a regicide, and his neighbor,
with thi clean shirt, is his oppressor, and
therefore his natural victim. Usually his
heart fails him and his madness spends it
self in foul words. Sometimes it does not, and
the world stands aghast. But it is not alone
against the chief magistrate that these thoughts
and deeds are directed. There are usually
others within closer range. There is scarcely
a man in our country prominent in any way â
statesman, banker, merchant, railway man
ager, clergyman, teacher evenâ that has not
somewhere his would-be Nemesis, some lunatic
with a senrational newspaper and a pistol pre
pared to take his life. '
Yellow Papers Scored.
Again a President is slain for the republicâ
and the lesson is ths homely one of peace and
order, patience and Justice, respect for our
selves through respect for the law, for public
welfare and for public right. For this country
is pas3in? through a time of storm and
stress, a flurry of lawless sensationalism. The
irresponsible journalism, the industrial war3,
the display of hastily gotten wealth, the grasp
ing of monopoly, the walking delegate, the
vulgar cartoon, the foul-mouthed agitator, the
sympathetic strike and the unsympathetic lock
out are all symptoms of a single disease â the
loss of patriotism, the decay of the sense of
Justice. As in other cases, the symptoms feed
the disease as well as indicate it. The deed
of violence breeds more deeds of violence; an
archy provokes hysteria, and hysteria makes
anarchy. The unfounded scandal sets a hun
dred tongues to wagging and the seepage from
the gutter reaches a thousand homes.
.The last words of â¢ Garfield were these:
"Strangulatus pro renublica"â "slain for the
republic." The feudal tyranny of the spoils
system which had made republican adminis
tration a farce has not had since Garfleld's
time a public defender. It has not vanished
from our politics, but its place is where it be
longsâamong the petty wrongs of maladminis
tration.
their land held other men in bondage and the
dearest hope of freedom was that such things
should not go on forever. I can remember
when we looked forward to the time when "at
least the present form of slavery should be no
more." For democracy and slavery could not
subsist together. The Union could not stand
half slave, half free.
Tbre* times has our nation been called upon
to pars tnto the shadow of humiliation and
â¢each time in the past its severe lesson it has
learned. When Lincoln* fell slavery perished.
To tfae American of to-day human slavery in
a. land of civilization is almost an impossible
conception, 'et many of us who think our
selves still young can remember when hair of
lessons of Tragedies.
We meet to-day under the sway of a number
of different emotions. We would express our
sorrow at the untimely death of a good man.
We would show our regret that our nation has
lost the chief magistrate of its choice. We
would express our sympathy with the gentle
woman who has been suddenly bereft of the
kindeet and most considerate of husbands. We
are filled with ehame that in our republic, the
land where all men are free and equal wher
ever they behave themselves as men, the land
which has no rulers save the public servants
tit its own choosing, a deed like this should be
rioesible. We would express our detestation of
that kind of political and eocial agitation which
finds no method of working reform eave
through intimidation and killing:. We would
â¢wish to find the true lessons of this event and
would not let even the least of them fall on our
ears unheeded.
\r.d one plain lesson is this: Under democ
racy all violence is treason. Whosoever throws
a stone at a scab teamster, whosoever fires a
shot Â«t the President of the TJnited States, is'
tin enemy of the republic. He is cuilty of
high treason in his heart, and treason In
thought works itself out in lawlessness of ac-
The central fact of all democracy is agree

compact of democracy Is that we change it In
peae*. "The sole source of power under God
is the consent of the governed." This Crom
well wrote oÂ»ee across the statute books of
Parliament. This, in other words, our fathers
wrote in our own constitution. The will of the
people is the sole source of any statute you
or I may be called on to obey. It is the decree
of no army, the dictum of no President. It is
the work of no aristocracy; not of blood or of
wealth. It is etmply our own understanding
that we have to do right, shall behave Justly,
shall live and let our neighbor live. If our law

There Is no other honest way, no other way

r.esa. of ignorance, of unpatriotism. If tyr

The ministers who marched were:
Ministers in the Line.
There Â»vere less than a hundred minis
ters Sn line, but they were from every
rlonominaxiun and from every creed. The
Protestant marched with the CathoHc,
the Jew with the Gentile. When It was
proposed that the ministers should ride
and that carriages should be provided
for the representatives of the'ehurches,
the ministers themselves said that they
would rather walk. All denominations,
all creeds, all differences In religion were
forgotttn.
There is net recorded in the history of
this cour.tr>' a similar situation, wnere
all denominations, no matter how diver
pent in c pinion, walked side by "side in
or.e common expression of grief at the
death of a citfzen cr ruler.
No raorj impressive funeral procession
was ever held in California. No more
sincere mourning service was ever held
iu the United States. This could not be
more forcibly illustrated than in the
little knot cf ministers who were not only
willing but anxious to walk over the en
tire line of march to show their sincere
regard for the departed President of the
United States.
Precession Was Impressive.
The parade in Oakland was representa
tive of no class cr creed. The whole peo
ple left their homes and either marched
in the parade or lined the streets to do
full honor to the memory of the nation's
idol. Citizens followed .closely upon the
footsteps of soldiers. The schoolboy and
the adult marched in the same rank. The
minister of the church of God marched
with the soldier under arms. Laborers
walked with their employers.

of crape that was used at the funerals of
Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfleld and
U. S. Grant being utilized. ' \
The parade was full of features, each in
itself indicative of the sorrow that was
felt. -It was full of earnest-, men who
marched over the streets in ; procession.
The people of Oakland had arisen in their
sorrow and if there were any sympathiz
ers with the creed of the Buffalo assassin
in the city- they must Â¦ have ' felt the
solemnity, the meaning of this demonstra
tion.
The narade was headed by Grand Mar
shal St. Clair Hodgkins, with his aids.
Captain W. J. Petersen, George W. Ar
per and Lieutenant Pierce of the Fifth
Regiment. National Guard of California.
Then, came the Oakland police, a com
pany of United States marines, a bat
talion of naval cadets from the training
school on Goat Island, three companies of
the National Guard and. the Veteran Re
serves. ' Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦..â¢â¢Â¦-Â¦. -'Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢:
The second division was headed bv the
Knights Templar, Â¦ under the command of
John A. Britton, with Webb N. Pierce as
marshal. Following the Templars came
the McKinley carriage. This carriage
was loaned by F. M. Smith on the occa
sion of the late President's visit-to-Oak
land, and. to-day it was loaded with
flowers and driven over the line of march.
This carriage was escorted by the honor
ary pallbearers, Benjamin . Ide Wheeler,

Societies in Parade.
The third division had S. J. Taylor for
its marshal.' ! The blue lodges of Masons
occupied' a large portion of this division;
with the Odd Fellows, the Knights . of
Pythias and the city and. county officials.
The Elks had the right of the. line of the
fourth division. ' John W. Tompkins was
the .-marshal. Included; In: this division
were the Workmen, Native Sons, Wood
men of the World, Knights of Maccabees
and Bohemians of America. V
Postmaster W. H.- Friend and the Oak
land Postofflce employers led the fifth di-
dead. President; W. W. Foote, a represen
tative of the Democracy and of the South
ern Confederacy, against which McKin
ley fought; E. B. Jerome and J. A. Col
quhoun, both comrades of the dead Presi
dent in the Grand Army of the Republic;
Robert M. Fitzgerald, a leader of the
Oakland Democracy; the Mayor of Oak
land, Anson Barstow; the president of the
Board of Supervisors, John Mitchell; Hon.
Victor H. Metcalf. Congressman from this
district, and Frederick S. Stratton, Col
lector of the Port of San Francisco. They
marched on foot over the whole line.
Every feature, every incident in the
whole parade showed that the people had
turned out to show their sorrow at the
untimely death of their leader. There
was sincerity and sorrow from the Head
of the procession to the very end: from
the police and the military to the school
boys and the citizens. ,
Many Masons in Line.
It is conservatively estimated that there
were 8000 men in line to-day. When it is
considered that every one of these men
was on foot, that every one from the
minister of . the Gospel, the Mayor of the
city and the president of the university
to the High School boys, who brought up
in the rear of the procession, had asked
for permission to walk in honor of â¢ the
deaa President, the sincerity of the senti
ment that the procession represented' can
be estimated. The procession vr&s twenty
eight blocks long. There were seven di
visions with as many bands of music.
/ Twenty thousand people gathered on the
sidewalks. And over this vast assemblage
was the great hush of death, as impres
sive as if the body of the man whom all
were mourning was to be borne through
the streets of Oakland. It was noticeable
that even the spectators kept the silence
that was 'due to'the dead' and that con
versations were carried on in whispers.
The measured tolling of the church bells
and the solemn music of the dirges
heightened the solemn effect and empha
sized the sincerity of the demonstration!
When the funeral procession Â¦ was first
proposed it was thought that the societies
of the city would be limited to two di
visions. Seven divisions marched over the
line, however.
The Masonic bodies of Oakland marched
for the first time in this city for a funeral
that was actually taking place in a far
distant State. Every Masonic body turned
out a full membership from the Knights
Templar to the blue lodges. At the head
of the Knights Templar was a fife : and
drum corps that played "Nearer, My God,
to . Thee.7 The corps .was forbidden to

to safely uphold the integrity of the republic.

of a mourning nation. The whole nation loved
their President. His kindly disposition and
affectionate traits, his amiable consideration
for all around him, will long be in the hearts
of his countrymen. He loved them in return
with such patriotism end unselfishness that In
this hour of their grief and humiliation he
would say to them, "It Is God's will: I am
content. If there Is a lesson In my life or
death, let it be taught to those who still live
and have the destiny of their country in their

There is a most eerious lesson for all of tin

If we arÂ« to escaoe further attacks upon our

lutely grapple with the monster of anarchy. It
Is not a thing that we can safely leave to be
dealt with by party or partisanship. Nothing
can guarantee us against its menace, except
the teaching and the practice of the best citi
zenship, the exposure of the ends and alms of
the rospel of discontent and hatred of social
order Â«nd the brave enactment and execution
of repressive laws.

morial services were almost
universal to-day "throughout
this State. .Perhaps, the. most
important and -impressive were
the ceremonies -at the cathe-'
dral ia -this -city, at which Car-*
dinal Gibbons delivered, the following
eulogy:
It has been my melancholy experlerice in the
course of my sacred ministry to be startled by.
the assassinations of three Presidents of- the
Vnlted States. ' .
In the annals of crime It is difficult to find an
Instance of murder eo atrocious, i eo wanton
and meanineless as the assassination, of Mr.
McKinley. . ... ,V
Whatever may nave been the errors of Judg-;
ment on the 'part of the late President (and
who Is free from them?) no man can honestly
charge him with tyranny or ornclal corruption.
The Redeemer of mankind was - betrayed by
the universal symbol of love. If I may rev
erently make the comparison, the President was
betrayed by the universal emblem of friendship."
The President could have said to his slayer:
"Betrayest. thou the head of the nation with'
the grasp of the hand?" He was struck down
surrounded by a host of his fellow-citizens,
every one of whom would gladly have risked
his life in defense of his beloved chieftain.' ,
Few Presidents were better equipped than
Mr. McKinley for the exalted position which
lie filled.
As President he was thoroughly conversant
with the duties of his office and could enter
into its most minute details. His characteristic
virtues were courtesy and politeness, patience
and forbearance and masterly self-control un
der very trying circumstaijees. When .unable*
to grant a favor he had the rare and happy
talent to disappoint the supplicant without of-,
fending him. The domestic virtues of Mr Mc-
K:inley were worthy of all praise. He was a'
Aiodel . husband. Amid the pressing and ! en-"
grossing duties of his official life he would,'
from time to time, enatch a few moments to"
devote to the invalid and loving partner of his
joys and sorrows. - - ,
Anarchy Must Be Crushed.
It is a Bad reflection that some fanatic or
miscreant has it in .hie power to take the life
of the head of the nation and to throw .the
whole country in|.o mourning. . It "was no doubt
this thought that inspired' some writers within '<
the last few days to advise that the President
henceforth abstain from public receptions â¢ and
handshaking and that greater protection should
be given to. his person. . ._ .
Tou might have him surrounded with co-"
horts, defended with bayonets and have. him.
followed by argus-eyed detectives and vet he
will not be proof against* the stroke of the as-:
sassin. Are not tbe crowned beads - of -Europe

how marf of ihfia have perished at. the hand"
of some criminal. "JCo. 'let the. President con
tinue to move amons his -people and take them
ly the hand. The strongest shield of our chief
magistrate is tire love and devotion of his fel-'
low-citizens. The most effective way to stop
euch crimes is to inspire. the rising generation
with greater reverence for the constituted - au
thorities and a greater horror for any insult
or injury to their peson. '. All seditious lan
guage should be suppressed. Incendiary speech
is too often an incentive to the acts of violence
to many with whom the transition from words
to deeds is easy. â¢â¢ â¢ -. . â¢
Let it be understood, once for oil, that the .
euthoritles are determined to crush the serpent
of anarchy whenever it lifts its venomous
head. Â¦ . -. *
We have prp.yed for tbe .President's life, but
it did cot please God to grant our petition.
Let ao one in: er from this - that our prayers
Â¦were- in vain. No fervent prayer ascending to
the throne of heaven remains unanswered. (Jod
answers our petitions either directly or indi
rectly. If he does not grant us what we ask
he gives us something equivalent or better. If
he has not saved the life of the President he
preserves the life of the nation, which is of
more importance than ths life of an indi
vidual. He has infused into the hearts of the
American people a greater reverence for the
hÂ»ad of the nation and a greater abhorrence
of assassination. Ke has intensified and ener
gized our love of country and our devotion to
cur political Institutions.
The President is dead! Long live the Presi
dent '. "William McKinley has passed away,
-honored and mourned by the nation. ! Theodore
Roosevelt succeeds to the honors and to the
responsibilities cf tbe Presidential office. Let
bis fellow-citizens rally around him. Let them
uphold and sustain him in bearing the for
midable burden suddenly thrust upon him.
May he be equal to the emergency and fulfill
his duties with credit to himself, and may his
administration redound to the peace and pros
perity of the American people.

of which has -already been performed.
- McKinley .won . hla epaulettes at Gettysburg.
â¢He was" successively- Congressman, Governor
of his State and 'President for two terms.- His'
promotion to r.the. last' exalted office made him
more. modest and more unassuming, if possible.

while before his- place can be filled. I believe
in immortality. in heaven and If there is any
immortality.; on 1 earth the name of McKinley
will endure as long as the , government by the

that so good a man is taken from us at this

away and both of these were good men. The
Â¦inarchist and communist, however, are power

ELOQUENT WORDS BY ARCHBISHOP
After the singing of "Rock of Ages" by
the choir Rev. Dr. Bell pronounced the
benediction and the congregation rever
ently filed out of the church.
. Perhaps at this very moment the bodv of our
slain brother is bein^ reverently lifted to his
last resting place. In this hour let hand cl.i3p>
hand and swear renewed allegiance to the coun
try for which the stricken chief magfstrato

successor 'to God's ..bra ve3t. God's grands?.
Ood's greatpst man. God bless and keep thta
natirn nrtd bring anarchy to a sneedy end ,in
the United States and all the world.
Anarchy Is bloody treason, for It planned- th*
malignant, cowardly assassination of a nation's
ruler. What a mistake it made in killing Mc-
Klnley,-;for in killing him it killed itself. Xt it
is not yet dead we as a nation must arise and
deal to it Its death blow. Anarchy must not be
tolerated in this free country any more. We
should not permit red-handed assassins to en
joy - its nrotection or breathe its native air.
We should hold them as a menace to the na
1 Inn's welfare.
. His was an ideal death for a Christian pa
triot to die. .Mysterious to us, but not to God.
with' whom there are no mysteries. Perhaps
there was no better way, no better time for him
to pass away, placed as he was In the very
zenith of his power. He died like a devout
Christian In the sure and certain hope of im
mortality. His was a' glorious death. Tho
memory of the just is blessed. God ble*s3 the
memory of 'William McKinley. ,
An Ideal Death to Die.
> If anarchy sntist'have a victim .why select
such a. man, who was born of thÂ© people, and
was but living for the people's Interests? Ha
was a plain, honest, man with a benevolent,
true and grand heart. His affection for his lov
ing wife but increased with her invalldlsm. and
liisted through all the triumphs of the White
House. . Best of all his good qualities, and they
were many, he was a devout Christian, a fol
lower of Â¦ Jesus Christ, living always near to
God. . :
â¢ Of "the. deep damnation - of his. taking off I
cannot trust myself to speak. The enormity of
the Â¦ crime demands- that we should find the
plotters'whq aided, abetted and incited the red
handed anarchist to his, hellish deed, and that
adequate punishment , lie meted out to them.
iFe and 1 they together must make. to a bereaved
ration the. full atonement for their cursed and
Â¦wretched, aet- - The spirit that struck down a
good man must perish. Justice iaf a holy thing
and is - quite as ne'edful as mercy. Any mis
taken kindness to. the guilty. is mistaken cru
elty to the innocent. The gaping- wounds of
McKinftjy.: cry out for vengeance.
After the placing of, two beautiful wreaths
on the bier of the fallen magistrate I bid you
tt.rry a little longer until' I have placed a sprig:
of Irish heather beside them. I do it In love
for the dead man and the nation for which he
d!:ed: Â¦ He needs no eulogy ; -his . good deeds
si:eak-for themselves. He has reached the land
o:! the living and we are in the land of thÂ«
dying. ; If we by prayer are lifted up to a no
b' er and more strenuous life and are made to
soefthe. justification' of .the ways of providence
then -these services :ha\%: not been held In vain.
Needs Ho Eulogy.
Eloquent . and forceful wag the eulogy
delivered by- Rev. Dr. Hemphill. In vig
orous language he denounced the perpe
trators of the cowardly deed which had
deprived the nation of Its idolized ruler,
saying' In part:
"Reciprocity treaties' are in harmony with the
times, measures of retaliation are not," will
live- forever.' Â¦
.He -'was a man of . religious purpose. As a
servant of the Prince of , Peace, he. loved peace.
He believed in the settlement of international
disputes "by arbitration -rather than at the
rr.outh of the cannon. His last speech at the
Pan-American exposition Is a grand effort
worthy of our best study. HlÂ» closing words.
. Why is this man so dear to ; the people oflthÂ«
United' States. Not any man since Lfncolii so
touched the hearts of the people as â¢ McKinley.
His statesmanship is a matter of â¢ historical
record. Â¦ If we look to his character we find an
affectionate husband; a kfndly, considerate man
to, the 'Weak and humble. He was a man of
stÂ«rn- Integrity In business and public affairs.
He . was- a- patriot 'devoted to his country,' but
hi3 ; greatest attribute, one inclosing alt his

NEW YORK, Sept. lQ.âWilliamiR. Hearst, proprietor of the New York Journal, was' hanged in

jeered and stoned forforty-eight hours, because the crowd feared that the police, would destroy
the efflgy before arrangements could be completed to burn it. On Wednesday evening the efflgy was
hanged again a block away, but the' police got around early to-day and themselves burned it.-

seemed to enter into every one, and the

The Pavilion was draped In somber col
ors. Hanging from its groined arches
were pendants of black and along- the
sides of the gallery were festoons of black
cloth bordered in white and over thla
were wreaths and stringers of smllax and
greens. The building was filled with -a
subdued light from scores of chandeliers
As a fitting background for the plat
form on which were the distinguished
guests, choir and orchestra, were the last
words uttered by the martyred President
just before his death.
The words that will live for all tlm
"Good-by. all! It is God's way. Let his
will, not ours, be done," were worked In
flowers of white and red and stood out in
bold relief before a background of azure
blue. On either side were flags and
wreaths draped in mourning. Flagpoles
with the national colors at half mast/tHfrt
draped also were a part of the generaj
effect. Â¦

As the church bells began to ring out
their call to worship the crowds began to
assemble at the main entrance to the Me
chanics* Pavilion. Early comers crowded
against the doors, while many were as
sembled at the Grove and Polk street en
trances. Toward noon the crowd had
reached large proportions and Larkln
street was so blockaded that it was
scarcely possible for the cars to get
through.
Chief of Police Sullivan and Captain
Wittman shortly after the noon hour, at
the head of a force of seventy-flve om
cers, began to handle the crowd, which
was increasing at every moment. Cap
tain Wittman suggested to William Greer
liarrison, chairman of the admission com
mittee, mat it would be well to open the
doors, but the latter Insisted on keeping
them closed until the appointed hour. 1
o'clock. At that time Larkln street and
other streets in the vicinity of the Pa
vilion held a throng of people stretching
for blocks.
On the Grove-street side the chorus and
some of the invited guests were admitted.
The Polk-street entrances were reserved,
for the civic and military dignitaries. Tho
latter had to pass through a large crowd
of onlookers. Officers and ushers we-?*
stationed in the aisles and other places.
and the crowd was so safely and care
fully handled that all were seated long:
before 2 o'clock.
Although there were 14,000 chairs placed
in the Pavilion every one was occupied,
but there was no crowding of aisles. Chief
of Police Sullivan and Captain Wittman
saw that the aisles were kept clear, ana
not a single accident marred the day. As
soon as the exercises were concluded the
doors were thrown open and the biff
building was quickly emptied.
It was remarked on all sides that never
had so large a crowd been so efficiently
handled in tKe Pavilion. While every one
wished to secure the best ' possible seat
the crowd was orderly. The arrangement
of seats in the Pavilion was excellent and
all had a chance to see and hear.

He drew a vivid picture of the career of
the dead President, and at the close of
his address offered a heartfelt prayer for
the repose of the soul of William Mc-
Kinley. Men and women wept aloud
when Rabbi Levy told ln eloquent lan
guage of the life and death of the lato
President.
The musical portion of the services
were of unusual excellence, and the tones
of the organ and voices of the choir
stirred the emotions of the large congre
gation.
The capacity of the Geary-street Syna
gogue was taxed to Its capacity yesterday
at the special memorial services held In
memory of the martyr President, and
long before the commencement of the
exercises the announcement was made to
waiting hundreds of men and women
that they could not secure seats ln the

The musical portion of the service was
rendered by Cantor Salomon, assisted by
the choir and the organ, the eulogy on
the martyred President being delivered by
Rabbi Isidore Myers, his text being from
II Samuel, chapter 3, verse 38: "Know ye
not that a prince and a great man has
this day fallen In Israel?"
The entire congregation was moved to
tears ' when Rabbi Myers delivered in a
voice trembling with emotion the "ln Me

services, whlcn was as follows:
Peace to thy soul, thou noble martyred chief!

Fcf nearly an hour before the head of
the funeral procession arrived at the gate
cf the ce:rsetery the strains of the dirges
played by the bands came over the hill
top to the watchers by the vault, telling
them that the procession was on its way.
Finally, at 3:3J o'clock, the detachment
of mov.r.ted police heading the parade
came sickly around the corner of Lin
coln street and passed up West Third
street to the cemetery gates. Behind
them came the Grand Army Band of Can
tor, the solemn notes of "Nearer, My
Gcd. to Thee," sounding out as it came
up the driveway. A moment after en
tering the cemetery the music was
changed t-> Chopin's funeral interlude and
it whs to the sound of .this that the band
passed out and on to Kentucky avenue to
the south of the enclosure. Behind the
ban.i came the Grand Army posts, fully
five hundred of the veterans marching by.
As they passed along the flower-strewn
p^th cstnjr of them were weeping bitterly
and they stooped by dorens to gather the
fclc-f scn.s which lay at their feet and car

school children of Nashville, Tcnn., and
r.o tribute of love that was seen during
the funeral exercises more amply fulfilled

message of affection.
Solemn T-Iusic in Parade.
No greater reverence has ever been
fhown to any man, living or dead, than
was exhibited toward the dead President
to-day. As the funeral car passed through
the streets men and women sobbed con
vulsively, and at the cemetery gates,
Â¦rheM the crowd was densely packed and
where the people had remained for hours
l;reÂ£s:r:s against the iron fence, two wom

vault. It was a wonderful tribute of sur
passing love that was rendered to-day in
his native place to the memory of Wil
liam McKinley. and it will be long before
gr^ctcr or more reverent honor is paid to
aay man.
it was exactly 4:01' o'clock when the
funeral car bore the remains of the dead
President through the gateway of his last
resting place. Twenty minutes after that
time thu brief services at the vault were
over a-;u the members of the family and
distinguished men of the nation wjio had
ccme so far to do him , honor> passed
through the gates on their homeward way.
One hcur and forty minutes after the
hearr.o had entered the cemetery the place
was c!rar and the dead President was
res'.irg: aicne under the watchful care of
the men cf the regular army. A sentry's
measured tread resounded from the
conent walk before the vault and kept
vigil on the grassy slope above, and at
the hea~ and at the foot of the casket
stood armed men. Before the door, which
vas not closed to-night, was pitched the
tent cf the guard, and tr-ere it will remain
until the doors are e'osed to-morrow.
Sentries will then guard the vault every
hour o( the day and night until the body
has been borne to its final resting place.
Greater Reverence Never Shown.
All day long the streets were kept clear
by the military, and not a vehicle of any
description save those belonging to the
funeral cortege were permitted to enter
upon them. Notwithstanding the dense
crowds no accident of any kind was re
ported.
There was not a window that command

were crowded to their utmost capacity,
and on the roofs were hundreds of peo
ple. From 9 o'clock in the morning* until
5 in the afternoon, by which time the last
of the parade had passed the church on
its way to the cemetery, this condition
prevailed.
For hours even before the time set for
the commencement of the funeral exercises
at the McKinley home the streets along
the entire length of the. line of march
were crowded with spectators. From the
gates of the cemetery to the doors of the
church there was on each side of the
street an almost unbroken line of sol
diers, and on all the intersecting streets
detachments of the militia were posted
about 100 feet from the thoroughfare on

VETERANS TAKE
FORMAL ACTION
Few words will be needed to interpret tha
sorrows of this calamitous day. The American
people stand by an open tomb. "With benedic
tions, mingled with tears, the President for
ever passes from view. The heart of tho
American people salutes the merrory of Wil
liam McKinley and passes on to accomplish
its destiny. The gates of the mausoleum are
closed; the standard of God and the consti
tution is lifted on high and with mourning yet
hopeful hearts we follow where it leads.
To-day wfe are assembled to pray and ponder
the lessons of the great life gone out. To
morrow we shall again â¢ think oi duty' ana
responsibility. Our hearts and minds are rest
ing to-day, resting by the open vault, resting
In the modest home, where God grant an af
flicted widow's head may be pillowed on the
pitying bosom of her mother's faith. We can
only think with inexpressible sorrow of the
loss we have suffered. We can only hope that
with the softening influence of the passing year
our loss will not be as terrible e.s it appears
to-day. Let us pray that our beloved country
may pass from this awful shadow of the crime
of murder; that God may turn the darkness of
our affliction into a beaming hope; that from
the grave of William McKinley and the other
martyrs of America the flowers of a generous
national manhood may diffuse their scent un
til in this sorrowing people all tts nations of
this earth shall be blessed.
People Bless His Memory.
Couple with the private virtues of this man
that fine public spirit that in the days of his
youth exposes his breast to the spitting fire
'of a rebellious cannon, but Is mercifully re
served for greater achievements and greater
honors, and complete the picture by presenting
William McKinley in the .fullness of his days,
the liberator of- people,.>who bless his memory
In languages that he himself could not under
stand. Give this to the painter of history and
it will constitute an Inspiration that will bless
all future days of the American people."
Every nation has Its monuments, but there
is no nation on earth that has as keen â¢ a
memory as the American people. An affection
ate remembrance of his achievements may ul
timately be expressed in statues that will
adorn public halls and public parks, but
greater than these shall be the deathless love
that makes of every child's heart in America
a temple wherein Washington and Lincoln
and all the others are placed for dally teach
ing and daily Invocation. And there stands
William McKinley from henceforth, in the
hearts of the children of America, the nation
of the future, and that shall be his .reward
and his Immortality.

Nature has been kind in selecting the
last resting place for President McKinley.
Westlawn Cemetery is on a high knoll
overlooking the peaceful valley, with the
busy little city of Canton laid out below.
If It were not for an intervening church
spire one might get from this elevation a
glimpse of the McKinley home. Here,
looking out on his native city and his na
tive State, the body of William McKinley
is laid to rest. The beauty of the grounds
has attracted the attention of the coun
try's best landscape gardeners, who have
journeyed here to study their attraction.
Tc-'day the cemetery was doubly beauti
ful â¢with the rustling trees giving off their
first yellowed leaves of fall and adding a
golden touch to the green clad slopes.
Just Inside the stately entrance stands
the graystone vault, where for a time the
casket will repose. Its dreary exterior
was relieved to-day by great masses of
flowers, banked all about until the gray
walls were shut out from view. 1 But in'
due time the casket will be taken from
the vault and committed to the little plat
of ground lying farther on. This is the
McKinley lot and here He his father,
whose name he bore; the mother he
guarded so tenderly in life, his brother
James, his sister Anna and his two chil
dren. And when that time comes a state
ly shaft of granite will arise above the
grave, telling of the civic virtues, the pure
life and the martyred death of William
McKinley. .
Nature Kind to HcKinley.
The President, the members of the Cab
inet and the officers of the army and navy
then entered their carriages, and followed
by the members of the family passed out
of the cemetery and returned to the city.
The delay caused by the services at the
vault being, over, the procession resumed
Its march. Every man 4 n the line save
those in uniform, who rendered appro
priate honor in other ways, went past the
casket with uncovered head.
As the head of the division containing
the Knights Templar wheeled into the
cemetery the quartet that had been de
layed in reaching the place for ,the pre-i
vious ceremonies took'tip a posltionto the
south of the vault and . sans .".Farewell.
My Brother.". This hymn was' followed
by others, including "Rock of â¢ Ages,",
"The Christian's Uood-nlght" and "Way
side Cross." The selections were beauti-"
fully rendered, and no part of the funeral
ceremonies in Canton was more impres
sive. The darkness was gathering fast as
the Knights sang on, and many in the
multitude around the casket were moved
.to tears, and the sound of sobs was dis
tinctly audible in the crowd that lined
the fence beyond the line of National
Guardsmen.
The last of the procession passed the
bier at 5:48, and then orders were given
by Captain Biddle that the â¢ cemetery
should be cleared. The order was quickly
carried out and the President was left in
the care of his guard of honor.
The first sentry to be posted in a tour
of guard duty before the doorway was

but In a voice that could be heard dis
tinctly by all who were grouped about
the vault. As Us words ended there was
a brief pause, for it had been understood
that a quartet of the Knights Templar
was to be present to render a hymn.
Through a misunderstanding, however, it
had not arrived, and after satisfying him
self of this fact Colonel Bingham waved
his hand to eight buglers of the Canton
band who had taken station upon the side
of the mound above and to the south of
the vault. Instantly from the eight bu
gles rang out the notes of the soldier's
last call, "taps." It was beautifully done,
and the last notes of the bugles died away
so softly that all who heard it remained
listening for a few seconds to hear if it
was really ended. When the last note had
floated away Secretary Wilson was in
tears, Secretary Hitchcock was also weep
ing and the President was gazing grimly
at the walk. ' It was the last moment for
the men who had been closely associated
with the- President for so long, and the
thought seemed more than most of them
could bear. It was ended at last, 'and Cap
tain Biddle of Company C of the Four
teenth Infantry, who will command the
guard which is to be placed around the
vault, stepped up to a line of five soldiers
which he had posted just north of the
doorway and who throughout the cere
mony had stood at "present arms" as
rigid as though carved out of iron. One
of them passed quickly Into the vault,
taking station at the head of the casket.
Another placed himself at the foot and
three men stood in the doorway, two on
the lower step and the third on the floor
of the vault directly behind them. There
they remained until after the passage of
the funeral procession.

that may be. made against him. The measure there-*
fore amply preserves all the liberty to which a man is
rightly entitled, and in no way conflicts with our po
litical ideals. V â¢Â¦'-->"
A recent summary of the bill states that it does, no
rhpre than to include among the', classes of immi
grants already barred by the exclusion laws all per
sons who may be regarded as enemies of organized
society. ". The bill .makes no attempt to define what
is meant by an anarchist, or what teachings are in
culcated by the.creedv of anarchy, but provides that
evidence that an immigrant asking admission into the
United States has belonged to any foreign anarch
istic society, or has been rated by the police of the
country from which he comes as an anarchist sus
pect,'is to be considered sufficient to justify his deten
tion and deportation, unless he can clear himself by
controverting testimony. ,To gather the evidence
necessary to hold aliens of anarchistic affiliations an
additional . immigrant inspection service is created,
twelve Secret agents : being: detailed to watch the lists
at emigrant passenger ports abroad, and with the aid
of the foreign police to identify such known enemies
of established government, as may seek to make the
United States a base for criminal activity.
OUT of the popular demand for legislation pre
venting the entrance" of : anarchists to this
country there "will probably come at the next
session of Congress -the passage of an immigration

the passage of the bill which was -prepared in 1894 by

pressed upon the minds of all classes of the people
was made -evident by the universality of the,mourn
ing. How long that lesson will remain dominant in
the minds of the public remains to be seen. In the
hearts, of someiit will be ever present, but others will
soon forget. From the community as a whole, how
ever, its teaching can never pass away. The nation
has not ha(f this great sorrow in Vain. In this city

was laid down to his long rest yesterday.

Moreover, political criticism In America is of such
a free and unlicensed kind that it would seem upon
the surface of things that we have but little respect
for the men who hold official 'positions among us.
The profound mourning over the death of McKinley
proves the falseness of that seeming.! In no land on
earth is the chief magistrate or sovereign regarded by
the great mass of the people with more of loyalty
misrepresentations on the part of his foes. The work
Is hard and the pay is small. The outward prizes ,of
official life are poor when compared with those which
are to be gained by . strong men in. any of the lucra
tive industries of the world. Consequently it is not
strange that at the close of a long life spent in pub
lic service some of those who have been ' most suc
cessful are heard to express regret that they did not
choose another vocation and follow out a far different
career.
These evidences of a well nigh universal love for
the memory of McKinley attest that after -all it is
worth while for a great man to devote his energies
to the service of the people. The career of a states
man is hard and often exasperating. At every point
he Is euhject-to party criticism from his political
opponents, and. to the antagonisms; of rivals in -his

Nature herself seemed to mourn. Though this is
the pleasantest season of the year in -San Francisco,
and the period at which we have niost'of sunshine and
least of fog or cloud, the day was dull and gray and
somber, as if the eky had been draped over for the
funeral. Throughout the city there was quiet,' and
in comparison with the usual noises of traffic along
the streets the hush was so deep as to impress itself
with something of solemnity upon the minds of all.
RARELY, if ever before in human history, have
the people of a great city shown such evidence
Â¦ of universal mourning as was manifest in San
Francisco yesterday. It was a day of virtually a com
plete cessation of business. Only such work as is
necessary to the daily life of the community was car
ried on. Workshops, stores, offices and saloons were
closed, and in many instances the merchants not only
shut their doors, but drew down the curtains over
their windows, so that there was no display to dis
tract the mind from the sorrowrof the occasion. â¢-*Â¦

- The method of procedure is as follows: A.pen'and ink draw
ing of the picture is glued to a panel of wood one-sixteenth of
an inch thick, .which is backed with a piece of wood of the same
thickness. Both are then sawed with a fine Swiss blade along
the lines, of the picture, the severed portions of the top panel
THE picture reproduced here is entitled "After the Storm
â A Scene, in the. Desert," and is a very remarkable piece
of work, being made of several hundreds of minute pieces
. of wood. The woods employed are perfectly natural, not
-stained or colored in any way; and to arrange them so'
that they will produce a picture in harmonious colors is cer
tainly a task requiring great skill and even greater patience.
The artist who produced the picture is E. C. Larrabee of Sa
lem, Mass. The tools he employs are a jig saw and a glass ta
ble that can be set at any desired an%le, and the material* ara

being removed. Minute r>ieces of wood of the right tint are
then arranged so as to produce the efTect of an oil painting,
without stiffness.. Mr. Larrabee says that he has sometimes
spent five hours in searching for a bit of wood of a particular
hue, and has then inserted it in its place in a few minutes. In
making a picture 14 by 10 inches from six to eight hundred
pieces of wood are utfed and five or six dozen saw blades ara
worn out, the sawing of some of the wood requiring great pa-*?
tience. .Among the many woods employed are Madagascar eb
ony and ebony from the Congo River region, ashen gray impee
from Manila, P. I., Alabama persimmon, English white holly,
American maple, gold colored babbool . from India, cream
quince from Massachusetts, pepil from Cuba and cream colored
olive wood grown in Palestine.
. Mr. Larrabee has produced a portrait of President McKin
ley, which now hangs on the walls of the White House, and
at an art exhibition recently held in the Public Library at"
Bridgeport, Conn., five of these remarkable pictures were
shown.

"is; a- curious condition ; of British politics that, re
quires {this old man to, remain;, in office.^ The empire
is suffering -from a -dearth of statesmanship. .,:., The
Liberals are- admittedly and hopelessly Without"' a
leader, and the retirement of Salisbury would leave
the Conservatives hardly any better off. Joseph
Chamberlain,- despite his admitted cleverness, has not
the confidence of any considerable/ following. His
career has been too full of changes. for the people to
trust him much." Balfour has never fulfilled the
promise of his youth and falls farrshort of the force
required of a Prime Minister. 'Rosebery is too given
to criticizing . things, ever to be a real leader. So
neither party has any man to offer, for the; place.
Salisbury, therefore, will probably be retained as long
as he lives. Even in decay he is'better than any one
else for the 'position. * Â»
Salisbury is said to have spoken all that in the style
of a man communing with himself rather than ad
dressing an audience, and as if he were seeking to
unravel some tangled skein of events with which he
had nothing to do further than 'to study it for the
gratification of an intellectual curiosity. He looked,
says the writer, as if "he-might have. been a philoso
pher summing up the meaning of an epoch, but he
did not look like a statesman whose business it is to
withstand fate." ....
: The London Chronicle recently gave an account of
the old statesman's manner in" making a speech on the
finances of. the empire. It says he spoke as if he were
detached. from the Government," and were an impar
tial, spectator viewing things which he does'not con
trol, but in which he acquiesces as a part. oi, the de
crees of fate. Virtually his argument amounted to
this: "There is^af great expenditure; there . is what
|may be called extravagance, but the cause of it is
wrapped up in the history of the times. The huge
outlay to-day is due to the economy of former years.
A love of national thrift reduced the country to a
state of disarmament, and in. this unprotected condi
tion it was compelled to spend money with bound
less liberality.. But there is another cause, more im
mediate and yet closely interwoven with the move
ment of history. It is a historical law that political
life is subject to perils and accidents. One- of these
was the invasion of the King's territory by the Boers,
and, as always happens when these unforeseen things
occur, the outbreak. of war caused great: expense..
There are great tides, too, in history which we can
not govern. ; We are in the full sweep of such a tide,
and this great outlay is' largely due to it; but there
is danger in such an expenditure, and the wise states
man-will watch it, and, where he can, curb it."- . ,
REPEATED reports and rumors of ' the ap
& proaching retirement; of Lord Salisbury from
< the British Cabinet may have no official foun
dation, but at /least they serve to show that in the'
opinion of a, considerable part of the British .public
he ought to retire. He is at present hardly' more than
a figurehead in the Government,* and is probably re
tained there solely because the Conservatives have
nobody to put in his place. ,-" V
THE .DECAY OF SALISBURY.
Dr. Etand, chief chemist of the Pasteur 'Institute
in Paris, has confirmed the report that the institute
has discovered a method' of producing food from ab
'solutely - inorganic matter, but he adds : "The only
objection to the process is that the production of the
food would require a' year with, an "ultimate cost of
$1000 a pound." 'Food like' that might be fit for the
gods," but it would be too high even for millionaires.

countries. It is gratifying to know . , that the . full
strength of the administration will be used in urging
the passage of a shipping bill. at the coming session,
for hardly any other legislation is more important at
this time. Â« Â¦ " .
Upon the other great policies it is hardly likely there
will be any dissensions.. It is true that for one reason
or another the .Republican party has not yet kept its
pledge to promote the upbuilding of the American
merchant marine, but the opposition is hardly likely
to be strong enough to prevenfthe desired legislation
this winter. Our expanding commerce requires a
larger merchant fleet than we have at this time upon
the seas, or are likely to have so long as our shipping
The problem of reciprocity is one over which there
have arisen some dissensions. There 'are sortie manu
facturers who -would quite willingly sacrifice our rural"
industries for the-Salce of getting additional markets
for. their manufacturecLgoods, ?and there are 'some
Eastern States seemingly willing, to sacrifice Western
interests for the sake of. Eastern trade; nor. can it be
denied' that some of the reciprocity treaties now be
fore the Senate are of a kind that would be unjust to
many American industries. In so far as the treaties
are unjust; -they violate the principle of reciprocity of '
which the 'Republican party is champion, and for
which McKinley stood' from the time he entered of-.,
fice down to the day when he delivered his. speech at"
the Buffalo exposition just before his assassination. ' 3.
In that address President McKinley said we should
seek to increase pur* foreign commerce "by sensible
trade arrangements which will not interrupt, our
home production." T In another place he > said: "We
should 'take from .'our customers such of their
products as we can use without harm to our indus
tries &hd labor.!' Statements of that kind make it
clear that such reciprocity as McKinley" favored
would not sacrifice any American industry for the
sake of promoting the foreign trade of another indus
try, .or, break down the comprehensive system of pro
tection with which "his name as a statesman is firmly
associated.
Of the various ; policies,; for which the.-administra
tiori stands there are four of paramount importance.
These 'are the^ adoption of reciprocity'treaties for .the
expansion of our foreign commerce, the development
of the American merchant marine by the aid of* wisely
devised legislation;, the construction of the isthmian
canal and" the laying of' a Pacific Ocean cable; With
respect to of these, the-President stands exactly
where his predecessor stood," and willvbe true to every
pledge the Republican party has ''made concerning
them. . '' * . . .

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES
. ON THE CINDER PATH
The decision. If It stands, will have a
very important effect There are twenty
five or thirty prisoners in the Oahu jail
who were illegally convicted and sen
tenced under the ruling of the court and
all may have to be tried over again. Some
of the cases are old ones, w in which the
witnesses cannot be found. Large sums
collected by the Hawaiian Government in
tariffs may have to be refunded.
After deciding to take up the case,
Judge^ Estee discussed at length various
decisions on the question of trial by jury.
He quoted the Xewlands resolution, as
did Gear, to the effect that Hawaiian
laws "not contrary to the constitution of
the United States" should remain In force,
and held with Gear that this meant that
laws that were contrary to the constitu
tion were abrogated and annulled. The
Hawaiian Supreme Court reversed Gear
on this point only a, few weeks ago.
Immediately after the discharge of the
prisoner he was rearrested on a new
charge. The prosecution hopes to hold
him until an appeal from Estee's decision
can be taken to the United States Su
preme Court.
Judge Estee first discussed at length. the
question of whether he should take juris
diction, referring to the delicacy with
which Federal courts regarded the ques
tion of Interfering with State or Terri
torial courts and saying that it was only
done when the conditions were peculiar
and unusual. He said that the Territorial
Supreme Court "decided one way at one
time and another way at another time
upon questions of the gravest importance
and which involved Identically the same
principle." He said that If it were true
that the American constitution, as it
provided the right of trial by juryt had
been nullified by the Territorial court there
should be an immediate remedy, and it
was his duty to take jurisdiction, under
such conditions.
HONOLULU, Sept. 13.â United States
Judge Estee yesterday decided that the
constitution of the United States was ex
tended to the Hawaiian Islands by the
Newlands resolution, sustaining the de
cision of Circuit Judge Gear and reversing
the Supreme Court of Hawaii. The deci
sion was rendered in the case of one Osakl
Manklchi, a Japanese, convicted of man
slaughter without the indictment of a
grand jury and on a verdict of nine trial
jurors.
A dispatch from Middlesboro says
twelve survivors of the crew of the Cobra
were landed there this "morning and con
firmed the report that all the others were
drowned. The British Admiralty has re
ceived information that the explosion oc
curred after the Cobra struck a rock and
that she sank immediately.
The Cobra was a turbine-englned ves
sel. She had just left the yard of her
contractors and was undergoing a boiler
test.
The first Intimation of the disaster was
the arrival of a fishing boat at Yarmouth
with six bodies which she had picked up
In the vicinity of the spot where the
Cobra was last seen. According to the
fishermen, the Cobra was sighted by the
lightship off Dowsing Sands yesterday,
enveloped in steam, and she shortly after
ward disappeared. The men on the light
ship supposed the Cobra had sailed away
until the evening, when they observed
bodies floating In the water and signaled
to the fishing boat to investigate the dis
aster.
Five boats were launched after the
Cobra struck, but some of them were
swamped in the heavy, sea which was
runnlns: at the time.
Lieutenant Bosworth Smith, the Cobra's
commander, stood upon the bridge with
his arms folded, as impassive as if on pa
rade, and went down with the vessel.
The Cobra had seventy-nine souls on
â¢ board. For sirty-seven no hope Is held
out, but torpedo-boats and cruisers have
gone at full speed to the scene of the dis
aster, which is the most serious the Brit
ish navy has suffered since the sinking of
the Victoria.
LONDON. Sept. 19.â The torpedo-boat
destroyer Cobra has foundered In the
North Sea, the result of an explosion.

PIETERMARITZBURG, Natal, Sept.
19.â In view of the Imminence of the re-
Invasion of Natal by General Louis Botha,
with a force of 1500 men, a special issue
of .the Gazette has called out a number
of men of the Natal corps to muster here

General French reports that Command
ant Smuts, In order to break through a
cordon, rushed on a squadron of the Sev
enteenth Lancers at Elands River Poort,
killing: three officers and twenty men and
wounding one officer and thirty men.
The Boers, who were dressed in khaki
and who were mistaken for British 1 offi
cers, lost heavily.
Major Gough, who escaped during the
night, reports that the Boers numbered
1000 men and. that they were commanded
by General Botha. â¢ .
â¢ A dispatch from Lord Kitchener from
Pretoria, dated September 18, announces
that the Boers on September 17 ambushed
three companies of mounted Infantry with
three suns, commanded by, Major Gough,
In the vicinity of Scheepers Nek. After
severe fighting the British were over
powered and lost their guns, the sights
and breech blocks of which were first de
stroyed. Two officers and fourteen men
were killed and five officers and twenty
flve men were wounded. Five officers and
150 men were made prisoners.

Sergeant Conboy arrested Oliver, who
made the first assault on McAllister, and
charged him at the City Hall Station with
battery. McAllister was treated at the
Emergency Hospital for slight bruises.
"W. F. McAllister, a special police offl
cer, was set upon by a gang of men at
Third and Stevenson streets last night
and but. for the timely assistance of Ser
geant Conboy, who witnessed the assault,
would have been severely beaten. Mc-
Allister claims that he. had been watched
and followed for some time. Last night
as he came out of a Third-street restau
rant he was attacked by a striker named"
Richard Oliver. In an instant he was sur
rounded by other strikers, who com
menced to beat 'him. Sergeant Conboy
made his appearance at thiis time and by
the use of his club managed to save Mc-
Allister from further injury. As the ser
geant was trying to get bis man to a
place of safety the crowd kept closing in,
trying to administer further punishment
to the special. C. H.- Carrington, a re
cently appointed special officer, worked
his way Into the crowd and kept the lead
ers-from doing further damage. Finally
the mob became so great that Carrington
was compelled to draw his weapon for
his own protection. During the trouble
Carrington fired a shot, but evidently
without hitting any one.

Among the officers who arrived on the

Lieutenant J. M. Munro, who Is at present
quartered at the Presidio.
This young officer won considerable
fame by his daring bravery while in the
Islands. He started with fifty, cavalrymen
to take the town of Bayonbong. When a
short distance from the town he tapped
the telegraph wires and sent a message
that he was coming with a large force to
capture it. He suggested in his dispatch
to the chief magistrate that he would first
send a troop of cavalry to the town and
that the dignitary allow them to make the
terms of peace. This frightened the na
tives. They all surrendered and Munro
captured 800 prisoners. He was warmly
commended in the dispatches to the War
Department at Washington for his clever
and brave deed/

President. At noon everybody was at
watch for the signal from Mare Island
and as soon as the ball on the ferry depot
dropped the warship appeared draped in
black and guns from the port. and star
board batteries began booming. After a na
tional salute had been fired the cruiser
went back to her old-time appearance and
after that one gun flashed forth every
hour. It was an Impressive scene. The
port is crowded with shipping and every
thing from a scow schooner to a four
masted bark and ocean liner had its flag
at halfmast- Owing to the crowd of ship
ping the Philadelphia had to run close In
shore and in consequence she is not five
ship's lengths from the â¢ wharves. ' The
sound of rfer starboard guns reverberated
heavily along the front," ' while ' some of
her port guns were lost in the echo.
As a result many people thought that only
nineteen guns were fired, having lost

C. H. Dietrich "Â¦ Is- United States Senator
from Nebraska and has-been making a
holiday tour of the Orient. As soon as
the steamship docked he hurried to the
obsequies of the late. President. .
Hazen stated at midnight that he had
not arrested- Cullinan, but that a close
watch was being kept upon him and that
he could be found when wanted. Hazen
declined to state the nature of the papers
he had seized, and when asked if Culli
nan was suspected of being an accomplice
of the President's murderer he replied
that he was still looking for evidence In
the matter. Cullinan is said to be a Jew
eler, and was recently In business on Post
or Polk street. It is expected that he will
be placed under arrest to-day. Startling
developments are looked for
Shortly before midnight it was reported
that Cullinan had been arrested by the
secret service men, but no. trace of him
could be. found at the County Jail or at
the City Prison.
Yesterday Secret Service Agent Hazen
and a number of his deputies were busily
engaged In scouring the city for evidence
against Cullinan, and it was learned that
Hazen had made a search of Cullinan's
room and found implicating documents,
the nature of which Hazen refused last
night to reveal.
Secret Service Agent Hazen has in the
past few days kept a close watch on a
man known, as Harry Cullinan, who is
suspected of being an anarchist, and who
Is thought to be implicated in the plot
that led to the assassination of President
McKinley.

French Troops Maneuver
I on the Plain Around
Fort Vitry.
COMPIEGNE, Sept. 19. â Emperor
Nicholas passed a day full of interest.
The morning was spent in witnessing the
final 3peratlons of the grand manuevers
at which the Czar for the first time came
into contact with the French military
operating under war conditions and not
merely in parade uniform.
The troops were concentrated on the
plain around Fort Vitry in the early
morning. Operations began at 10 o'clock,
on the arrival of the Czar, -who. sur
rounded by French and Russian staff of
ficers, followed most of the movements
horseback. The Czarina and # PresldeTit
Loubet, accompanied by M. Waldeck-
Rousseau, the Premier, followed in car
riages drawn by six artillery horses.
The skirmishing army corps early de
veloped an attack upon Fort Fresne, the
minor fort. The Czar and Czarina, with
M. Loubet and others, mounted the earth
works inside and watched a whole army
corps advancing to the assault. It was a
highly" theatrical operation, utterly im
possible in war, but carried out with the
dash for which the French soldier is fa
mous and it aroused the enthusiasm of.
thousands of spectator.!.
A significant incident Illustrating the
anxiety of the French, not only to Insure
the Czar's safety but to avoid the slight
est cause for uneasinesis on hi3 part, oc
curred during the assault. The infantry
had reached the edge of the moat and wan
pouring flre into the fort -when some of
the attacking party aimed in the direc
tion of Emperor Nicholas, who was a
prominent figure, and stood watching the
vanguard sliding down poles into the
moat and fixing the selling ladders. One
of the generals noticed the direction in
which the rifles were pointed, and, hasten
ing to the scene, pushed the muzzles
aside, explaining excitedly: "Don't flre In
the direction of the Czar."
The closing phase of the operations,
when the entire force of 140,000 men was
In action, was viewed from an eminence
near Fort Vitry.
It is worthy of note that the Russian
Emperor chatted cordially with General
Andre, the Minister of War. which was
an excellent repudiation of the assertions
made by the Nationalist organs that the
Czar ' regarded him, as a dlsorganizer oi
the French army.
As both cases were reported late to
night the Coroner did not sot any time for
the inquests. When they are held Cor
oner Mehrmann says he will conduct a
thorough examination into the causes
which led to the death of the men.
The striker called others; to his assist
ance and together they set upon and beat
Matheson until he was almost insensible.
Matheson managed to make his way to
his home In Alameda, where Dr. H. M.
Pond was called in to attend him. The
physician found him to be suffering from
brain concussion and severe bruises and
treated him for them. Hisi patient could
not recover from the shock and died this
morning. He was 42 years of age and un
married.
Matheson was a coachman and had been
driving *.a truck in San Francisco during
the strike. He quit work one day last
week because, so he told his aged mother,
who speaks in a broken tongue, he had
been threatened by the strikers and feared
for his life. He .did not go to San Fran
cisco again until last Saturday, when he
had to go to attend to some personal mat
ters. While on East street he walked into
a saloon to get a drink, where he was
iecognized as a non-union workman by a
striker.
After being in the hospital for several
days McGuire was removed to his home
in this city, where he was treated by Drs.
Rowell and Dukes. They found him to be
suffering from severe body bruises and
concussion of the brain. He did not im
prove under their ministrs.tion. however,
and died at an early hour this morning.
McGuire was 49 years old and unmarried.
The moment he stepped off the ship
after she had docked at the San Francisco
wharves, McGuire told his people, he was
attacked by a crowd of unknown men.
They set upon him and. struck' him ..on
the head a number of times with iron and
wooden bars and after besiting him into
insensibility made off. The- victim of the
assault lay in an unconsicous condition
until found by friends, who took him to
the Emergency Hospital on the city
front.
The story told by McGuire to his broth
er-in-law, Joseph Cumming s, and his sis
ter, with whom he lived, ws.s to the effect
that he arrived about ten days ago on
the sailing ship Fresno from Alaska, hav
ing been in the employ of the Alaska
Commercial Company. He was a boiler
maker, but had been forced to ship on ac
count of the lack of work. He knew
nothing about the strike situation in San
Francisco and was not in any way antag
onistic to the unions.
Two workingmen whose homes were in
Alameda County died to-day as the re
sult of Injuries inflicted upon them by
strikers, according to the stories as to
the manner of their deaths told by their
relatives to Coroner Mehrraann. One of
the victims of violence is Frank Mc-
Guire, who lived with his relatives at 434
Forty-fifth street, Oakland, and the other
is Remus Matheson, the only support of
his mother, living at 914 Central avenue,
Alameda. Both men died from injuries of
the head.

Nine months ago Miss Hansen came
from Seattle and went into the employ
of Frederick Levy. 2321 Devisadero street,
as nursegirl. On July 24 of this year she
made application to the City and" County
Hospital for employment as a trained
nurse, but her application was rejected,
ehe being somewhat illiterate so far as
the spelling and pronunciation of the
i-nglisa language were concerned. She
was a native of* Denmark, 25 years old,
and has a sister, Louise Haneen, residing
at East Orange, N. J.. and a cousin,
whose Christian name is -Ella, residing
In Park City. Utah. A letter found among
the effects of the suicide, written by her-
Felf, speaks of her being "bothered" very
much with her head and expresses her
Deller that her life would soon come to
an end.
The discovery was made by T. Wllkin
80a Tetley, proprietor of the furnished
rooming house at that number, about 11:30
o'clock in the forenoon. Having ob
served that Miss Hansen had not made
her appearance and suspecting that she
might be sick and in need of medical as
sistance he knocked at her door, and re
ceiving no answer peeped over the tran
som and eaw her dead body on the floor,
her head and neck being close to the
door knob. An entrance was forced, and
it was found that Miss Hansen had tied
a. whitÂ© silk handkerchief about her neck,
passed one end of the loop around the
knob and strangled herself. j .
Mr. Tetley Informed Deputy Coroner
Median that on September 1 Miss Han
ten appeared at his place -with a man
about SO or 85 years old. The man had a
young child in his arms, and Informed
Mr. Tetley that Mies Hansen was a nurse
by occupation, that she had become run
down in health by overwork and needed
a quiet room where she could have rest.
Â£he paid two weeks' rent and requested
a room next to nome lady lodger* She
seemed to be a very quiet, modest girl
and had no visitors whatever.
Miss Johanna Hansen, a housemaid,
committed suicide yesterday by hanging
herself to the knob of her bedroom door
at 1111 Sutter street.

Mr. Sternheim was a member, of Pacific

On July 4. 1872. Mr. Sternheim espoused
Miss Rosie Fox at Laporte, Ind.. and the
fruit of the union were a son, Benjamin
F., and daughter, Blanche. The deceased
was | enabled -by close attention to his
business to amass a considerable fortune.
Although 62 years of age, Mr. Sternheim
had not' until recently complained of ill
health/ He had shown no symptoms of
heart disease, which was the â¢ cause of
death, and his cudden demise came as a
blow to his family, and friends. He was
In the best of spirits when he left his
home at 1728 Bush street, and conversed
freely with his family on their way to the
temple. The death was at once reported
to the Coroner, who after an investiga
tion decided that the remains might be
sent to the family home without delay.
The news of the demise was withheld
from those who attended the memorial
service, and â¢ there were few who knew
that: while ths service was in progress
Mr. Sternheim lay cold in death in the
vestry-room beneath. Â¦ > .
The deceased was a native* of Heinstadt,
Germany, where he was born on October
10, 1839. He came to this country when
quite young-, and early in the '60's arrived
In San Francisco. In '1863 he engaged' In
the crockery business with Mr. Wangen
heim under the firm name of â¢ Wangen
heim. Sternheim & Co. On the death of
Mr. Wangenhelm, in 1889, the firm name
was changed to Sternheim & Son.

Samuel Sternheim, the well-known crock
ery merchant, with the suddenness of a
flash of lightning- at 1:15 o'clock yesterday
afternoon in the vestibule of the Temple
Emanu-El, on Sutter* street. Mr. Stern
helm was accompanied by his wife,
"daughter and son, their- intention being to
attend the- memorial service , in . memory
of the dead President. The" party had
reached the vestibule. and were standing
beneath the /"sable, hangings ; there when
Mr. Sternheim placed his hand -'to'-' his
breast, gasped, feebly and fell to the floor.

In Chinatown every store, warehouse,
gambling den and theater -was closed.
Over each barred door was a picture of
McKinley draped with, black. Since the
day of the tragedy j in the exposition
grounds the Chinese have evinced an un
usual interest in the affairs of the Presi
dent. Before his death and at times when
hope alternated with fear they inquired
of white pedestrians after his condition.
When told that there was great chance
for recovery they* smiled. Just before
death came and when dismal reports
came from. the. Milburn house a gloom
bverspread Chinatown which is not yet
dispelled.
Street venders and the owners of stands
removed their goods from the sidewalks,
and the only articles for sale on the
streets were little emblems of respect â
the American colors entwined with crape.
Some places hitherto' open to the public
continually had no doors to close, and in
their absence temporary streamers or
black hung over the space. Flaming ad
vertisements were concealed by mourning
and draped flags. Show windows werÂ»
shut from public view by curtains. Many
restaurants remained closed all day, but
from the force of public necessity a large
majority opened in the evening at 5
o'clock. l
Along .Market,. Kearny and other busi
ness-thoroughfares nothing stirred in the
marts of trade. Every, window and every
door. displayed cards-bordered with blacK.
Each one of the placards, bore .the simple
words, "Closed out of respect to the mem
ory of the late President McKinley/'
Some ended with a prayer that tne soul
of the man who was being laid away with
a nation's tears might rest in peace. Not
only were such announcements shown In
stores both large and small, but the pro
prietors of saloons and cigar stores,
touched by the sweeping -wave of. sym
pathy, had turned their keys and left
their- places -<3eserted. â â ;
The spirit that moved , men to respect
the | memory of the dead was universal,
extending not.' only Â£ over ' the .territory
wholly, American, but to quarters where
other tongues are spoken, and where loy
alty to other flags was not 'quite obliter-',
ated in the process of immigration. Ks-'

Its Charter Draped.
We pray thee. O God of Might, Wisdom and
.Justice, through whom authority is rightly ad
ministered, laws are enacted and Judgment is
decreed, assist with thy holy spirit of counsel
and fortitude the President of these United
States, that his administration may be con
ducted In righteousness and be eminently use
ful to thy people, over whom he presides, by
encouraging due respect for virtue and reli
gion, by faithful execution of the laws In
Justice and mercy and by restraining vice and
immorality. Let the light of thy divine wis
dom direct the deliberations of Congress and
thine forth In all the proceedings and laws
framed for our rule and government, so that
they may tend to the preservation of peace,
the promotion of national happiness, the in
crease of industry, sobriety and useful knowl
edge and may perpetuate to us the blessings
of equal liberty.
We recommend likewise to thine unbounded
mercy aU our brethren and fellow citizens
throughout the United States, that they may
be blessed in the knowledge and sanctified In
the observance of thy most holy law; that they
may be preserved in union and that peace
which the world cannot give, and after enjoy
ing the blessings of this life be admitted to
those which are eternal.
Finally we pray thee, O Lord of Mercy, to
remember the souls of thy servants departed,
who are gone before us with the sign of faith,
and who repose in the sleep of peace. To these,
O Lord, and to all that sleep In Christ, grant,
Â¦we beseech thee, a place of refreshment, light
and peace, through the Savior Jesus Christ, our
Lord, who liveth and reigneth world without
end. Amen. ]_Â¦â¢_- J.
Archbishop's Prayer.
The Archbishop then read the prayer of
the Catholic church and asked the con
gregation to add Its prayers. The prayer
is as follows:
The press must respect the constituted au
thorities. The welfare of the State and of
society demands It. To ridicule the President
is to ridicule the republic. To ridicule and
sneer at the constituted authorities is to rid
cule and sneer at the nation. To attack elected
and lawful rulers so foully, so unfairly. Is to
raise up enemies against them and against
the republic. No more must we suffer the
propaganda of anarchism.
It 1Â« a shame to recall, it provokes our bit
ter indignation to think of the contumely, the
ridicule, the abuse, the denunciation which
were poured out by degraded, unmanly, cow
ardly and malignant newspapers upon the
noble, worthy gentleman, William McKlnley;
against the painstaking, honorable President,
whi injured no man, who bore hatred for
none. Shame on those papers which hounded
President McKlnley and used every false and
dishonorable means to place him In a false
light before the nation; which misrepresented
his words and actions; which cartooned and
lampooned him; which denied him not only the
respect due to the head of the nation, but the
respect paid to the humblest citizen. Ehame,
I eay, upon the cowardly, infamous mallgners
who, during the years when President I McKln
ley was striving sincerely for the nation's good,
treated him as brutally and unfairly as they
-would not have dared to treat a common crim
inal, an outcast; as they would not treat the
very murderer who Elew him.
-Miy all of us learn a lesson to-day of good
citizenship. Let us learn lessons of devotion
to oar country, and let us so live that God's
blessing may fall upon us. It Is with sorrow
and ehame that we behold the service that
must be held to-day. It Is with profound sor
row that a man in the prime of life and our
leader should be taken away. We feel that
it is & shame that In a country so large and
full of liberty as ours such a deed should
take place.

ELOQUENT WORDS BY ARCHBISHOP
The Rev. Mr. Mills read an adaptation
of Tennyson's ode to the Duke of Wel
lington. After the singing of "America"
was concluded the benediction was pro
nounced. As the audience dispersed
Beethoven's "Funeral March" was ren
dered.
When Presiaent McKlnley fell, then fell for
you and me all that was beet of us. He had
been marked out by fate because all that was
good, creat, gentle and tender in him was in
you and me. Let all men resolve to bring their
IH-ee into harmony with the beautiful and
lovely features that characterized bis life.
The death of President McKinley is the direct
result of tolerance of the American people to
the roepel of despair. Out of that frontier spirit
which made men so eelf-willed that they only
could govern themselves has grown a spirit of
pessimism and complaint.
This is a day when It becomes a citizen of
the republic to examine himself to see whether
he has in any manner contributed to mold,
not by direction, but by indirection, the' fiend
ish sentiment which inspired the hand that
killed the President.
The congregation sang "Nearer, My
God, to Thee," following which Colonel
John P. Irish was introduced. In part he

FITTING REWARD
:MM for dr. rixey
After prayer by the pastor, the choir
sang "Abide With Me," and a benediction
was pronounced by the Rev. Dr. Adams.
Dr. Adams said by way of introduction
that there had never been a day when
the American people were so completely
one. Every village had suspended busi
ness and ail the people were mourning
not merely the President but the man.
All were giving honor to the sincerity,
the large sympathy, the great-heartedness
of the martyred President.
Rev. Dr. Adams read the 'President's
proclamation, In accordance with which
the service was being held, and the con
gregation Joined in singing "Nearer, My
God, to Thee." â¢ â¢ .
As the opening number the choir sang
"Sleep the Last Sleep." The pastor, Rev.
Dr. George C. Adams, offered prayer and

offered the prayer, and Rev. John Rhlllys
read the scriptural selections. The cadet
corps of fifty boys attired in uniform
occupied a conspicuous place in the
church. Dr. Rader spoke eloquently and
drew tears from his auditors by his ex
pressions of sorrow for the martyred
President.
The Third Congregational Church on
Mission street, near Fifteenth, was far
too small to accommodate the Immense
crowds that sought admission to the me

The audience and chorus, accompanied
by the orchestra, sartg the verses of "The
Star-Spangled Banner." which concluded
the saddest memorial service ever held In
San Francisco.
The funeral march from "Erolca" by
the orchestra and a singing of "America .
by the chorus and audience followed in
order, and then the Rev. Dr. Hutsinpll
ler delivered the benediction, which was
as follows:
Have no fear for the future. It Is full of
glory and of hope, happy with a bow of
promise extending from one end of the land
to the other. We have only to do right, seek
justice, obey the law, live as McKinley lived,
teach children to be as he was. and this will
be a nation of patriots, of noble women, of
God-fearing men. (Applause.)
Those who thought they would bury Theo
dore Roosevelt when they made him Vice
President, if such there were, bullded better
than they knew. Never. In an hour of agony,
did a man exhibit greater wisdom and pru
dence than when, an he took his sacred oath
of office to administer the laws' and protect
and defend the constitution of the United
States, he said that it should be his firm pur
pose to carry out the plans and the principles
of Mr. McKlnley for the honor, peace and
prosperity of our common country. (Applause.)
His words fell like a benlson upon the people of
the United States. They fell like the calm of
God descending upon a troubled nation. And
when the new President gathered around him
those faithful associates of the dead and took
them to his heart and said to the people, "He
Is gone, but I am Jiere, so help me God, to
exercise his will; be not afraid," he showed
himself as great as any who ever took oath
of office in this nation. (Applause.)
History will write of William McKinley what
deserved to be written, and when the book is
made up his life and time and service will
form one of Its most beautiful and glowing
pages. I make no exceptions. He le below
no man who haa ever lived in this country,
and history will so record him. There, were
great men before Agamemnon; thers were
great men after him. There were great men
before McKlnley: there will be great men after
him. who will bave in view, as he had. the
honor, the glory and the prosperity of the hun
dreds of millions who shall come to live upon
this continent. We shall possess them, because
conditions here make such men possible. The
ration never haa been in danger but God has
raised up a living shield to ward - off the
harm.
"Have No Fear for Future."
It is said that matter never perishes; that
every particle in the universe is preserved in
one form or another; that nothing is lost. It
is equally true of that which is great and good
in life. Of the Influence the President will
have upon the future no man can estimate
the weight, nor can we here exaggerate It. His
place Is fixed. His fame is as the stars, per
manent as the nation, true as the light, clear,
bright, glorious. No human tongue from this
hour on shall vilify him. no hand shall be
raised to drag that divine form down from the
pedestal on which the American nation has
placed It. There.it will remain to be remem
bered long after his detractors have returned to
dust and their works have followed them,,
If this shall be the result; if these people
shall be reformed and regenerated; if out of.
this catastrophe shall come a higher and no
bler ambition on the part of the teachers of
the time, the great public press; if there shall
come a higher Ideal as to the protection that
should be thrown about the executive head of
the nation by the press; If It shall be bo ar
ranged that hereafter there shall be no assas
sin with word or dagger who shall reach him,
or that the destroyer shall be disposed of In
ways* I will not attempt here now to discuss,
but that shall forever hold back the hand that
would strike the pen that would defame, or
the pencil that would libel, caricature and de
grade without cause, him who has been se
lected by his fellow-citizens to administer the
law, our martyred President will not have died
wholly In vain.
I sanction the widest range of criticism.
Every public man in this nation Is a light set
on a hill, and as he shines the nature
and the character of his illumination should be
known to all men. But there Is that which
ought not to be, that which the American peo
ple have this day served notice must not be.
And If this warning is heeded I say again that
our dear friend did not die In vain. His life,
shortened though it was, will have another
crown of glory and the setting of his sun will
send rays of light far to the zenith, ages after
his human form shall have passed away.
May Not Have Died in Vain.
I believe we have all learned a lesson. We
have come to the conclusion that there Is too
much glittering generality In the constitutional
declaration that no law shall be passed abridg
ing the liberty of the press or the right of
free speech. Liberty is one thing; I ice rife Is
a very different thing. The right to live In
this country that has so widely thrown open
its arms to the people of all nations to many,
the right of refuge, is one thing; but the right
of the anarchist and the enemy of human so
ciety to stalk his way among this people and
spread his deadly doctrines and Incite and
hurry on feeble mental organizations to the
commission of crimes such as he would never
dare to commit himself, cannot longer be tol
erated: he must stop. (Applause.) If there
Is no law for it the law will be found. If it
does not exist upon the statute books, it shall
be put there. (Applause.) If. it requires an
amendment to the constitution of the United
States, the constitution shall be amended. , (Ap
plause.)
Morecver. these people who have been so long
permitted to plot while we have rested In
our selfish and cold indifference to what has
happened In other lands, must be made to
suffer here and now. What was it to us if
Alexander perished by a bomb? What was it
to us if the good King of Italy was murdered?
What to us if Carnot, the President of our
sister republic, died by the hands of an assas
sin? What to us if Elizabeth of Austria met
her death by the poniard of one of this spawn
of hell? What was it to us? Why, It was
nothing to us. But the chicken has come
home to roost. Shall we act now? Shall we
deal with this subject as it ought to be dealt
with? I firmly believe we shall. I am confi
dent, that before another year Is gone we Fhall
have laws, not precisely such as were the alien
and sedition laws of John Adamsâ but which.
If we had them to-day, would seem a good
kind of legislationâ we shall have laws that
will enable the authorities of this nation to
capture known anarchists and those who asso
ciate with them, put them on board a Govern
ment ship and send them together to some
unoccupied Island. That may be one reason
why God gave us the Philippines. (Applause.)
Send them to one of our unoccupied islands,
give "them agricultural tools and a few barrels
of dynamite, and then say to them, "Now you
have what you want; you have no government.
You can kill one another." (A voice, "Kill
them.")
Let the past go. Forgive as our dear Presi
dent forgave. But let him who' proposes to
renew that epecles of evil look out for him
self.

Henry I. Kowalsky Speaks Before
the Grand Hospitlum in
Oakland.
Henry I. Kowalsky delivered the ora
tion at the memorial services held yester
day by the Grand Hospltium of the Bohe
mians of America in Oakland. He said in
part:
There Is Joy in heaven while we weep on
earth 1 . Our grandest citizen haa been .called
above, to sit forever In the sight of his Heav
enly Father, while we mourn 'In. sackcloth and
ashes! All that is earthly of our martyred
President is being laid irway In the country
churchyard, In the home that has known him
Binco his youth. Standing at his bier are the
representatives of all nations, and with them
the civilized world sheds Its tears'.
The cannons roar forth their ponderous adieu,
the muffled drums sound the token that causes
the flag of the nation to be lowered over him
who has been its champion and who as its
Btajidard-bearer In war and peace held It high,
pure and untarnished to the vision of all the
world. My countrymen, our subject Is rich In
virtues beyond the poverty of our language to
describe, yet we owe the duty to the millions
of freemen yet to be born to tell on this day,
as best we can, the story of the life It breaks
our hearts to say adieu to. .
After a review of McKinley's life Colonel
Kowalsky concluded his oration with the
following:
He loved us because wa were his people,
we loved him because he was from our midst.
His justice was complete, his honor always
high, his Integrity never questioned, and If
ever a perfect man, rich In honors, rich in
friends, passed from earth to heaven, it was
our martyred President.

awful crime; and we request the Congress of
these United States to pass such laws as will

Whereas, While our great and noble Presi
dent. William McKlnley, at a gathering of the
people In Buffalo, where all were rejoicing, was
approached by a stranger In apparent friendli
ness, but with a bandaged hand' treacherously
concealing the weapon of destruction; and.
Whereas, In keeping with Â¦ hla kindly and
sympathetic nature, our warm-hearted Presi

to this creature, only to be shot down by the
cowardly assassin and anarchist; and.
Whereas. We, In common with all right

prayer for the life of our beloved chief magis

Up till then you can buy a good fitting, stylish and durable suit for $6.55 or over-
joat for $5.55? providing 'ypif can find your size in a pattern that pleases you. We have
the garments in air sizes, but each pattern only contains one or two sizes. We expect that
the suits and. overcoats will last until the sale ends, but the sooner you buy the less risk
you run in getting what you want. ;
If a customer is displeased we will take back the clothes next week and^return his
money. We know the clothes are bargains and that he won't want his money. But it will
be here for him if he does. -
Remember the sale ends to-morrow night.

Brutal Treatment of E. T. Haas by
Pickets of Machinists" Union.
The - high-handed manner in which
strikers Intimidate and attack strangers
whom they, suspect to be Identified with
non-imiori workers was illustrated by the
unwarranted and brutal assault upon E.
T. Haas, the' civil engineer and contKact
or of 320 Sansome street, on the Santa Fe
ferry last Tuesday evening. -'. *
According to? the statement of -Mr.
Â±iaas,-he was returning to the city -from
the country, whither he had gone on a
business trip. A number of non-union
machinists were expected to arrive on
the same train, and some twenty pickets
of the Machinists' Union were on board
the boat in readiness . to meet and argue
the question with the new-comers. Mr.
Haas was seajted reading a paper, when
a crowd of the pickets approached him.
What transpired is described by Mr.
Haas as follows: - . " -.
. "One of the men asked me who I was
and what my busines might be. I an
swered that that was my affair, and I
declined to satisfy his curiosity. The
men then became abusive, and when I
persisted in my refusal to tell them what
my business was a. dozen others were
called up, and three flourished revolvers
In my face, I was struck simultaneously
on the head, and face, receiving severe
cuts on the scalp and lip; from which
the blood flowed copiously. Finding that
no one was willing to assist me. and
rearing to be beaten insensible, I was
compelled to give my. name and announce
my business. They affected to disbelieve
my statement and demanded proofs of
my assertion. An acquaintance of mine,
also a civil engineer, identified me, but
even this did not satisfy my assailants,
and they made threats against him. They
finally left me alter abusing me roundly
and defied me to see the captain of the
boat and - have tl*em punished. I could
get no redress for the wrong done me,
and, although one of .the pickets had the
manhood to apologize to me subsequently,
that did not compensate me for the In
dignity cast, upon me by the ruffians: .
â¢ "That such a state of affairs should ex
ist in this community is a shame and dis
grace. When men-who have nothing in
common with the. strikers are wantonly
assaulted by amob In defiance of law
and absolutely without fear of punish
ment, it is time to cease boasting of our
liberty and rights as citizens. When trav
elers on the public highways must sub
mit to insult or suffer attack at the hands
of a gang of ruffians who fear neither
molestation nor punishment, * a state of
anarchy prevails which it Is the duty of
the authorities to suppress without loss
of time." .
Captain, Anderson and His Pistol
Â¦ Rout Strikers. "
The prompt' action of Captain Anderson
of the Pacific Mall dock and the persua
sive eloquence of his six-shooter yester
day saved two non-union firemen from
one of those beatings for which the water
front is now becoming famous. Anderson
was coming out of a restaurant opposite
.the Mail dock when the two men were'at
tacked. There was no policeman in sight;
so Anderson interfered and arrested two
of the attacking party. ~ ,-.....
A crowd of strikers continued the at
tack on the non-union men. Anderson
pulled his revolver and threatened to kill
the first man that attempted to lay a hand
on either of the men. Tne crowd dis
persed and later Sergeant Wolfe arrested
four of the men on the charge of being
drunk. / Â¦ . ; .
Captain Anderson's action averted what
might have been quite serious
The conduct of the strikers alarmed the
neighborhood, one woman telephoning to
police headquarters for assistance. Au
gust Busse, the proprietor, of the restau
rant in which Anderson had. been eating,
said that but for the captain's interfer
ence the two non-union men would have
been seriously injured or possibly killed. ,
BETRAYS HIS TRUST.
r Through the duplicity of a union sailor
picket . Captain Gunderson ' of . the . bark
Agate has lost the four remaining, mem
bers of his crew. 'The Agate is lying at
Mission-street wharf No. 2. Â¦ Ship and
wharf have been carefully guarded by a
watchman employed by the captain ever
sir.-ce the vessel came alongside. On Wed
nesday evening the watchman reported
himself too sick for "duty, but introduced
a friend to the .skipper as a man that
could "be depended upon. Captain Gunder
son took his' watchman's word and ac
cepted the "friend" as a substitute.
Â¦ When Gunderson went, on board his
ship yesterday morning, there was noth
ing there but the cargo. -The "friend". of
the watchman/as subsequently develope.1,'
was a union sailor and had used -the op
portunity his ' trust gave . him to , go on
board; the ship 'and persuade the crew to
desert. They left with all their belong
ings. The "friend" then boarded the Czar
ina, a privilege his post as watchman
gave him. - His ; missionary work on the
collier, however, J met ' with . discourage
ment. He then deserted his post and was
not on hand yesterday morning to face
the man, whose trust he had betrayed.* /; V

CHICAGO Sept. 19.â Locked up in a
heavy barred vault in Captain: Porter's
private office in the quarters occupied by
the United States Secret Service Bureau,
according to Detective | Gallaher, is the
handkerchief In which Anarchist Czol
gosz concealed his weapon when firing
the shots that killed President McKinley.
The tragic relic was brought to Chicago
from Buffalo by Detective Gallaher, who
is attached to the. Chicago branch of the
secret service. It .will be taken- later on
to the trial of the assassin at Buffalo, to
be used as evidence before the jOry which
tries him. A study of the piece of cloth
has led to the startling discovery that lt
is a woman's handkerchief. It is an ordi
nary fabric of white cotton, such as can
be purchased at any Chicago store for 5
cents. Â¦ "
x Just why the Chicago secret service of
ficer has retained the handkerchief when
all the other articles in evidence have
been surrendered, to the Buffalo . police is
a mystery which Captain Porter and De
tective Gallaher refuse to explain. The
handkerchief is not only an important
piece of evidence, but may also serve as a
clew, to the identity of the assassin's ac
complices. _â¢Â¦ - Â¦ '

The services at the Catholic churches
were elaborate and touching, as they were
at the Grace Reformed *â¬hapel, where
President Roosevelt worshiped when a
resident of Washington.
General H. V. Boynton read the Presi
dent's proclamation and he recalled the
words of Garfield on hearing of Lincoln's
assassination: "God reigns, and the Gov
ernment at Washington still lives."
Rev. John Paxton was the speaker of
the day at the New York-avenue Presby
terian Church, his theme being "It Is
God's Way." "This is not an indignation
meeting," said Dr. Paxton. "but a funeral
service, not to curse assassins and advo
cate lawlessness in exterminating lawless
ness."

To the people of Washington the late
President McKinley .was more than an
officialâ he was their kindly guardianâ
and they rendered their tributes of re
spect with their whole hearts. .The peo
ple in accordance. with President Koose

The" Metropolitan M. E. Church, where
Mr. McKinley worshiped, was the center
of interest, and here the services were
more impressive than elsewhere. The
President's seat was draped in black ana
left vacant. It waa originally set apart
for President Grant and has ever since
borne tho inscription, "Our President.
The crowd could not be accommodated In
the main body of the church, and a sec
ond Service progressed in the lecture hall.
Bishop Waring and Dr.' Crawford spoke
in each place. The services were presided,
over bv Rev. Dr. Naylor, assisted by Dr.
Hugh 'Johnson of Baltimore, the former
pastor of the church, and Rev. George B.
Teach. The hymns were the favorites of
the late President. A tribute' was read
by Bishop Cranston. One significant ut
terance by Dr. Crawford was ' that the
President's words when Czolgosz was as
saulted would do more for law and order
than anything that had been said for a
generation.
The services at the Episcopal Pro-
Cathedral also were elaborate and impres
sive.. They were personally conducted by
Bishop Satterlee, assisted by Rev. Dr.
Devrles. rector of St. Mark's, and Chap
lain Pierce of the One Hundred and Fif
teenth Infantry, U. S. A. The bishop's
address was poetical and brief.' He. felt
called, he said, to sound a note of warning
against the unshielded and unprotected
position in which the American people
leave their chief magistrate and to re
proach them, rather than the "ignorant,
plotting anarchists, for the third tragedy
in the nation's history."
Justice Brewer of the United States Su
preme Court delivered the principal ad
dress at the First Congregational Church.
His keynote was the need- of impressing
upon all Americans the necessity of ; a
personal respect for the law. He depre
cated the general suggestions that the
people take the law into their own hands
and put every anarchist speedily to death.
While anarchy may be the extreme of law
lessness, he said, every breaking of the
law breathes, though in a slighter degree,
the same spirit of lawlessness. It was the
duty of the citizens to show by their own
conduct and example that social order was
the culmination of human happiness.
At All Souls Unitarian Church Carroll
D. Wright, Commissioner of Labor, was
the principal speaker, though Secretary
Long, when called, responded with a few
brief remarks, eloauejit with praise for
the memory of.* the dead. President.
Wright's address was reminiscent of per
sonal memories of the late President, and
he drew interesting parallels between his
career and those of Lincoln and Garfleld.

The cause of this universal mourning: Is to
be found in the man himself. The inspired
penman's picture of Jonathan, likening mm
unto the "Beauty of, Israel," could not be
more appropriately employed than in chanting
the lament of our fallen chieftain.; It does no
violence to human speech, nor is it fulsome
eulogy to speak thus of him, for who that Has
seen his stately bearing, his grace and manli
ness of demeanor, his kindliness of aspect,
but gives assent to this description of him. It
was characteristic of our beloved President
that men met him only to love him. â¢ h fy
might indeed differ: with him. but in the
presence of such dignity of character anil
grace of manner, none could fall Â¦ to love the
man. The people confided in him. believed in
him. It was said of Lincoln' that probably no
man since the daysr of Washington waa, ever
eo deeply Imbedded and enshrined in the hearts
of the people, but it Is true of McKinley In a
larger sense. Industrial and social conditions
are such that he was, even, more than Ws
predecessors, the friend of. the whole people. ,
: Touching Scene in Church.
A touching seine was enacted in this church
last Sunday nl*ht. The services had 'closed.
The worshipers were gone to their homes.
Only a few lingered to discuss the sad event
that brings uÂ»' together to-day. Three men .in
working garb of a foreign race and unfamiliar
tongue entered the room. They approached tho
altar, kneeling before it and before his pic
ture. â¢ Their lips moved as if In prayer, while
tears furrowed their cheeks. They, may have
been thinking of their own King Humbert and
of his untimely death. Their emotion was elo
quent, eloquent , beyond speech, and Jt boro
testimony to their . appreciation of maniy
friendship and of honest worth.- '
It is a glorious thing to be able to say _ in
this presence, with our illustrious dead be
fore us, that he never betrayed the conndence
of his countrymen. Not for personal gain _or
pre-eminence would he mar the beauty of his
soul. He kept lt clean and white before God
and man, and his hands were unsullied by
His eyes looked right . on and his eyelids
looked straight .'before him. _ He was sincere,
plain and honest. Just, benevolent juid kind.
He never disappointed- those who believed In
him, but measured up to every duty < and met
every responsibility in . life grandly and un
flinchingly. â¢ Â¦ - . j , â¢':
Not only was our President brave, heroic and
honest; he was as gallant a knight as ever
rode the lists for his lady love in the days
when knighthood- was in flower. It is but a few
weeks since the nation looked on with tear
dlmmed eyes as it saw with what tender con
jugal devotion he sat at the bedside of his
beloved wife, when all feared that a fatal Ill
ness was upon her. No public clamor that he
might show himself to the populace, no. de
mand of a social function was sufficient to
draw the lover from the bedside of his wife.
Ho watched and'walted while we all prayedâ
and she lived. This sweet and tender story all
the world knows. And the world knows that
his whole life had run in this one groove of
love. It was a strong arm that she leaned
upon and It never failed her. , Her smile was
more to him than the plaudits of the multitude
and for her' greeting- his acknowledgments of
them must wait. After receiving the fatal
wound his first thought was that the terrible
news might be broken gently to her. May
God In this deep hour of sorrow, comfort her.
May his grace be greater than . her anguish.
May the widow's God.be her God., â¢
Beauty of Character.
Another beauty of the character of our Presi
dent, that was a chaplet of grace about his
neck, was that he was a Christian." - In . the
broadest, noblest sense of the â¢ word, that was
true. His confidence In God. was strong and
unwavering. It held him steady in many a
storm, where others wera driven before- the
wind and tossed. He believed in the father
hood of God and in his sovereignty. His faith
In the gospel of Christ was deep and abiding.'
He had no patience with any other theme of
pulpit discourse. "Christ and him crucified'.',
was to his mind the only panacea for the
world's disorders. He believed it to , be; the
supreme duty of the Christian minister to
preach the word. He said, "We do not look for
great business men to the: pulpit, 'Â¦' but ; for
preachers." It- is well known that 'his godly
mother had hoped for him that : he would be
come a minister of the gospel and that she
believed lt to be the highest vocation In > life.
It was not, however, his mother's faith, that
made him a Christian. He had gained in early
life a personal knowledge of Jesus which guided
him in the performance of greater duties and
vaster than have been the lot of any other
American President. I He said at one time."
while bearing heavy burdens, that he could
not discharge the dally duties of his life -but
for the fact that he had faith in God.' ,. â¢ Â¦ 'Â¦ .
William McKinley believed In prayer. In the
beauty of it, in the potency of it. Its language
was not unfamiliar to him,' and his public ad
dresses not infrequently evince â¢ the* fact.". It
was perfectly consistent -with his life-long con
victions and his personal experiences that * ha
should say as the. first critical moment after
the assassin approached; "Thy kingdom come,
thy .will be done," and that ' he . should declare
"at the last. "It's God's way; his will be done."
He lived grandly; lt was fitting that he should
die grandly. And now that the majesty of
death has touched and calmed him we find
that in his supreme moment he was still a
conqueror.
My friends and countrymen,*. with what Ian- Â¦
guage shall I attempt to give expression to
the deep horror of our souls as I speak of the
cause of his desith? When .' we. consider the
magnitude of the crime that has plunged the
country and the world into unutterable ; grief
we are not surprised that one nationality after
another has hastened td repudiate the dread
ful act. This gentle spirit, who hated no one,
to whom â¢ every man was. a brother, was sud
denly smitten by the cruel hand of an assassin
and that, too. while In the very act of ex
tending a kind and generous greeting to one
who approached him under the- sacred guise
of friendship;
Mystery of Providence.
Could the assailant have realized how awful
was- the act . he was about to perform, how
utterly heartless the deed, methinks he would
have stayed his hand at the very threshold-of
it. In all the comlne years men will seek In
vain to fathom the > enormity of that crime.
Had this man who fell been a despot, a tyrant,
an oppressor, an Insane frenzy to rid the world
of him might have sought excuse, but . It ; was
the people's friend Â¦who fell when 'William Mc-
Kinley received the fatal ; wound. Himself Â¦ a
son of toll, his sympathies were with the Roller.
No one. who has seen the matchless Â¦ grace and
perfect ease with, which he greeted such ; can
ever doubt that his heart was in his open hand..
E?very heart throb was for his countrymen.
That his life should be sacrificed at such time;
Just when there was abundant peace, when all

CANTON, Sept. 19.â Never before on this
continent has such a floral display been
seen at any public occasion; as that: in
Westlawn Cemetery . this afternoon. The
vault was lined with the rarest and cost
liest flowers, a multitude .: of floral pieces
was spread on the ground before the door
of the vault and r for 100 feet to. the right
and left of the doorway, and for half as
many feet to the rear of 'a line passing
through the front-wall' it was "Impossible
to tread, so thickly did the tributes- lie.
Nearly every country on both hemispheres
was , represented by an , offering. The
number of -those from the > United States
was almost past counting. > They j came
from every. atate in the Union and, there
is scarcely a man in .public life whose
tribute of respect for the virtues of Wil
liam McKinley -did not. lie beside his cof
fined remains this afternoon. .; - :,
The inside of the vault .was literally a
mass of roses and orchids when the casket
was carried* into it and ; the outside walls
were weli-nlgh .hidden'beneathrthe.profu

But it was a triumphal march. How vast
the. procession'. The nation rose and stood with
uncovered head. The people of the land are
chief . mourners. The nations of j the Â¦ earth
weep with them.. But oh, what a victory! -. I
do not ask you In the heat of public address,
but in. the' calm moments of mature reflec
tion, what other man ever had such high hon
ors bestowed upon him by so many people?
What pageant has equaled this that we look
upon? We gave him to the nation but a little
more than four years ago. He went out with
the light of the morning upon his brow, but
with his task set and the purpose: to complete
it. ,. We take him back a mighty conqueror.

At the conclusion "of Dr.* Manchester's

The hymn, "Nearer, .My God, to Tnee,
was sung by the entire congregation: The
people remained standing after the close
of the hymn while the benediction was
pronounced by Monslgnor T.-P.:Thorpe

The casket was then borne from the
church to the funeral car and the march
of the procession to the cemetery began.
He has, mdeed, returned to us, but how?
Borne to the strains of ."Nearer, My God, to
Thee,", and placed where he first began life's
struggle, that the people might look and weep
ever so sad a home-coming. â¢ .
He Has Returned.
We hoped with him that when his work was
done, freed from the burdens of his great office,
crowned with the affections of a happy people,
he might be permitted to close his earthly life
in the home he had loved. . ' N
. But our last - words must be spoken. - Little
more than four years ago we bade him good
by as he went to assume the great responsi
bilities to which the nation -had called him.
His last -words as- he left Us were: "Nothing
could give me greater pleasure than this fare
well greetingâ this evidence of your friendship
and sympathy, : your good. will, and, I am sure,"
the prayers of all the people with whom I have
lived so long and whose confidence and esteem
are dearer to me than any other earthly honors.
To*all of us the future is as a sealed book,. but
if- 1. can by, official act, or administration,- â¢ or
utterance in any degree add to the prosperity
and unity of our beloved "country and the ad
vancement and well being of our splendid citi
zenship -'I will devote the best and -most un
selfish efforts of, my life to that end. > With
this thought uppermost in my mind I . reluc
tantly take leave of my friends and neighbors,

and thoughts of my old homeâ my home nowâ

'Another ' great ' lesson that we should heed is
the vanity of earthly . greatness. In tha pres

all the trappings of wealth and distinctions of

said: "I am' the resurrection and tho lifer he
