WASHINGTON. March 29.-An Import
ant dispatch was received "at the War De
partment to-day from General MacArthur
at Manila, dated to-day. It did not refer
to Aguinaldo or Funston, but In the opin
ion of the War Department officials it
went far to support the prediction made
by General MacArthur in yesterday's dis
patch relating to those two leaders, to the
effect that the end of the rebellion ls near
at hand. This dispatch chronicles the
surrender of a considerable Â¦ additional
number of insurgents and military arms,
and the Important feature of it is that
the surrender marks the complete stamp
ing out of the insurrection In the island of
Mindanao, which Is, next to Luzon, tha
largest island In the group. The dispatch
is as follows:
. "MANILA, March 29.â Brigadier General
William A. Kobb reports the surrender at
Sumulao, Mindanao, ' of nine officers, 160
men, 187 rifles and - eighty shotguns of
Capistrano's command.. This ends the
trouble in Mindanao as far as the'Filipi
nos are concerned. /.-â¢Â¦--..
"Brigadier General Robert P. Hughes
reports that Alikpali and Ruiz, with thir
ty-four guns, surrendered to Captain Da
vid Shanks, Eighteenth Infantry, at Mam
burao; 206 guns of Fulton's command sur
rendered to Lieutenant Colonel William
S. Scott, Forty- fourth Infantry.

ble on Mindanao.
It ls reported that the Spaniard, Segovia,
an ex-insurgent who recently acted as
General Funston's interpreter, who gave
valuable -assistance to the expedition
which resulted in Aguinaldo's capture,
will be recommended for a commission as
an officer of native troops. The- othur
three ex-insurgents officers who took part
in the expedition are known to have re
ceived heavy money rewards.
SURRENDER, OP INSURGENTS.
These two statements are characteristic
of the shifty nature of the Filipino leader.
Aguinaldo, in the course of conversation
on the gunboat, said that he had never
been in a single battle, a statement which
may, perhaps, be true. He admitted that
he had ordered the assassination of Gen
eral Luna, giving as his reason that the
security of the Filipino cause demanded
General Luna's death.
NEW YORK, March 29.â A Sun cable
from Manila says: While he was being
brought here by his captors on the gun
boat Vlcksburg Aguinaldo said" that in
June, 1899, he, together with a number
of his officers, swore . to prosecute me
war as long as they lived. He considered
this oath inviolate and had Intended to
live up to It. Later he declared that he
desired peace from the outbreak of hos
tilities, and if he was convinced that a
majority of his followers desired the ces
sation of the war he would use every
means in his power to accomplish tnis
end.
While Being Taken to Manila.

said he had under consideration the mat
ter of rewarding General Funston for his
services in capturing the Filipino chief.
The delegation regard thejr interview as
encouraging and hope to see the Kansas
man made a brigadier general in the reg
ular establishment, but its members were
careful to -say that the President gave
them no promise nor any indication aa to
his intentions in this regard.
They would not be surprised, however,
if considerable opposition to giving P"un
ston a brigadier generalship should de
velop at the War Department. There ia
no disposition in tho regular establish
ment to belittle General Funston's ex
ploit,-especially since the receipt of Gen
eral MacArthur's dispatch giving full
credit to Funston, but there would natur
ally be opposition there to jumping a vol
unteer officer 35 years of age into the
grade of brigadier general, and the Kan-
Baa delegation recognize this fact.

Returning Officers Tell of Their Work
Interesting stories of the pursuit of
Filipino Insurgents are told by- officers of
the Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth regi
ments of United States Volunteers who
arrived on the transport Logan yesterday.
These officers also liberally praise the
daring deeds of Brigadier General Fred
erick Funston. the captor of Aguinaldo.
When the Thirty-third left here in Sep
tember. 1S99, Colonel Hare was in com
mand, the next ranking officers being
Lieutenant Colonel Brereton and Major
Cronin. Colonel Hare was promoted to a
brigadier generalship and Lieutenant Col
onel Brereton died In Manila, eo Major
Cronin was given the command of the
regiment.
"As soon as the Thirty-third reached
Manila," said Colonel Cronin yesterday,
"we were sent north to Llngayan and
from that time on we never gave the in
surgents a rest. On November 11. 1S9U.
we had a pitched battle with over 1300 of
Aguinaldo's men. In that fight Major
John A. Logan was killed. A few com
panies of the Thirty-third were garrison
ing the city of Vigan when an assault was
made by the rebels They outnumbered
our men two to one and It was the hottest
tight of the whole campaign.
"Aguinaldo's wife and two sisters sur
rendered to Major March of the Thirty
third, and I and my men captured Agui
naldo's mother, his son Miguel and Felipe
Buencamino. the Filipino Secretary of
State. Old Mrs. Aguinaldo is a most de
termined woman and if her son has any
force of character he gets It from her.
She is about 80 years of age and looks
more like a European than a Filipino.
"Miguel Aguinaldo was about three or
four years old and a holy terror. When
he got Into a tantrum the only thing his
nuree could do to pacify him was to give
him a big cigar. This the baby would
Ught and smoke down to a half-inch
stump. His constitution must have been
undermined as he died soon ' after his
capture.
"A detachment from the Thirty-third
under my command was later joined by
a detachment from tbe Thirty-fourth un
der Lieutenant Colonel Houze and Major
Penn, Lieutenant Gillmore and his party
of marines. All the men In the regiment
have seen hard times and we are more
â¢than glad to get horns. The regiment was
recruited from Texas, Oklahoma. Indian
Territory and a contingent came from
Chicago."
The Thirty-fourth was recruited from
Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
\\ yoming and Montana. Many of them
were with Roosevelt in Cuba and fully
one-third of the regiment had seen pre
vious service before sailing for the Phil
ippines. On arriving at Manila the regi
ment was sent to Cabantuan. where it
M-as broken up into divisions, some of
which did not meet again for eighteen
m S nt Â£5;, Garris Â°n duty and chasing the
wily Filipino kept the regiment going and
at times whole companies were barefooted
and half naked owing to forced marches
through Jungles and over mountains. The
breaking up of the Filipino army into
small parties was due more to the un
yring energy of the \ Thirty-third and
Thirty-fourth than perhaps any other two
regiments In the Philippines.
All the officers wno came back on the
Logan were delighted to hear of the cap
ture of Aguinaldo by General Funston.
Their praise of the daring Kansan was
not stinted, and onÂ« and all laughed at
the idea of bribery, figuring in the matter.
The following officers who came home on
the Logan served under General Funston:
Majors Wheeler ante Shunk, \CaptaIns
Barnes and Sullivan and Lieutenants Deil
nck, Rittenhouse and Matson.
"General Funston Is one of the most
courteous and pleasant men I ever met."
said Major Shunk yesterday. "He is a
volcano of energy and nothing seems to
tire him. I was in command at San IbI
dro from December. 1899. to February.
1900. and as San Isidro was the general's
headquarters I eaw a good deal of him.
He would Just as soon go out with five
men behind him as 500, and he was never
beaten back. He generally rode a black
horse and wore a white coat. In a fight
he was in and out among his men and
used a carbine with the best of them.
When he first arrived at San Isidro he
went all over his district, a distance of
over 100 miles, with only a corporal's
guard in attendance. He escaped but a
few days later, a telegraph operator, a
signal man and five eoldiers of the Twen
ty-fourth being captured by the Filipinos.
He would swim rivers and .take chances
that, few others would tackle, but hia
men were always right behind him. Once
he wanted to get to Bautista and I wanted
to send an escort of fifteen men along.
From San Isidro to San Fernando, where
?ifi was Â« to tak , e the traln - ls a distance of
thirty-five miles and parties of our men
who had to go over the road were con
stantly fired on. General Funston would
not take an escort, but with three men
for company made the journey in a twe
mule wagon."
All the officers who served under him
speak in the highest terms of the daring
gallantry and soldierly qualities of Brig
adier General Funston. Mrs. Funston is
now at San Isidro with her husband but
both of them expect to get home about
next June.
The soldiers on the Logan were taken
to the Presidio on the steamers Sunol
Resolute and Grace Barton, while the
civilians and discharged men were landed
at the transport wharf.
Woodman, after ha had surrendered to
the authorities, declared that he had not
intended to kill his wife, but that a charge
of shot that was meant for Jones went
wide of its mark and hit her. He said
he had warned Jones to keep away from
his home, but no attention was paid to
his threats. Made desperate, at last by
his wife's supposed infatuation for Jones
and the latter's attempt to break up his
home he resolved to kill Jones when next
he found the couple in company. This
evening when his -wife and her supposed
lover went for a walk he got his shotgun,
followed them and opened fire. Excite
ment spoiled his aim and his wife fell at
the first fire, although he had Intended to
spars her life.
Jones and Mrs. Woodman were on
friendly terms and for some" time the
jealousy of the husband has been aroused.
Several weeks ago he threatened to kill
his supposed rival for : the affections of
his wife. This evening Jones and Mrs.
Woodman met and went for a' walk to
gether. When they were about 200 yards
south of the railroad bridge Woodman
came up behind them and opened fire.
His weapon, was a shotgun. Four shots
were fired at tha couple. One charge
pierce'd the heart of the woman, killing
her Instantly. Another struck Jones In

for the reason that no exact dividing lino

additional expenditure would have been

ticularly true of the increased naval ex

new construction and other improvements
not In any Â¦way connected Â¦with the insur

cost of the army has been necessitated by
operations in the Philippines, but part of
it is chargeable to the military occupa

. This committee was given arbitrary
power by the general convention of min

the month to declare a strike if the cir
cumstances warranted it. In the opinion
of the committee, expressed In a lengthy
address issued this evening: and - which
was prepared by President Mitchell him
self, the circumstances did not warrant a
strike at this time. ;
Mitchell made an address at the after
noon session of the committee which was
conservative In the extreme. He spoke
of his .visit to New York and his efforts
to secure interviews with the men who
control the anthracite coal trade. He said
all the concessions asked for had not been
granted, but the outlook for the future
was bright, and it was his opinion that
the day was not far distant when the
operators of tho anthracite region would
see that it was to their advantage to
meet their miners In joint conference. It
took some time and hard work before the
bituminous operators would consent to
meet their miners, but they eventually
did. .
Some members of the committee, it was
said/ were in favor of pursuing a radical
course, on the ground that if the oper
ators did not recognize the miners' union
now the opportunity would be lost for
ever. President Mitchell, however, soon
convinced the committee that a conserva

this time.

Stanton Brown, who came here two
months ago from San Francisco, has re
turned to the city from an exceedingly
adventurous trip to the north. His boat
was capsized in the surf, and after losing
his entire outfit he narrowly escaped
death from exposure. For a week he
camped on the shore In rainy weather
without a fire, and he had only- a little
oatmeal dally to eat during that time.
Brown is a large, strongly built man,
but he Is now worn and emaciated. He
left here three weeks ago, taking an out
fit worth $500 with him. After leaving the
steamer he went In his open boat to the
head of Knights Inlet. There he met ex
ceedingly rough weather, and while try
ing to make a landing his boat capsized
In the surf. He swam ashore, and the
only thing he saved of boat and outfit was
a sealed tin of oatmeal. This he subsisted
on for six days, and It was on the even-
Ing of the seventh that he wandered into
an Indian settlement and got help.
Two snowstorms occurred Immediately
after Brown was wrecked, and this added
to his misery. He could not make a fire,
and several times he expected .to go to
sleep and die. He was badly frozen and
Is still in great pain from, the privations
of the trip. The Indians cared for him
and he was sent by them to Vancouver
to-day.

enne Gedge, daughter of Dr. Donald
Gedge of San Francisco, one of the best
known physicians in that city. The child
had started for school and while waiting
for a street car at the corner of Main and
Eleventh streets a man drove up In a
bugjry, alighted and threw a shawl . over
her head. He lifted her into the buggy,
bound her hands and gagged her and
drove rapidly toward the country road.
He stopped at a point near Vermont ave
nue and entered a clump of trees.
As soon as he was gone the child leaped
from the buggy, and, after she had run
half a mile, a young 1 man on a bicycle
released her hands and removed the gag.
She finally reached the terminus of the
University car line, and, boarding a car,
reached home In a highly excited condi
tion at about noon.

Does Not Intend to Give Up
District Attorneyship
Voluntarily.
Denies Senator Bard's Recent State
ment That He Has, Quit the
Contest in' Favor of L.
H. Valentine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. March 29.â The United
States District Attorneyship of Southern
California, which for weeks has been the
capital prize In the lottery of local poll
tics, Is asain at stake. War has broken
out afresh, with all its former flercenes3.
The so-called treaty of peace -which was
said a few days ago on the authority of
Senator Bard and former Assemblyman
L. H. Valentine to have been signed had
been abrogated.
Frank P. Flint has decided not to vol
untarily give up bis present billet after
next winter, when the United States ben
ate â¢was to have confirmed the nomina
tion of L. H. Valentine. Flint will re
main in the running: to the end or the
game. If he Is to be displaced. Senator
Bard will have to come out into the open
and oppose his reappolntment.
Flint says that he was never a party to
any formal deal by which he was to step
down and out next December or at any
other time, and he declares that he has
by tho contrary statement been placets, tn
a false light before the public.
"In reference to the appointment of
United States Attorney to succeed me. '
said Flint to-day. "I wish to say that I
did signify to Senator Perkins and Sen
ator Bard my desire to be reappolnted.
as an indorsement of my administration
of the office which I have held for four
years. Afterward I informed them both
that It was my Intention to retire at the
end of this /ear for the purpose of devot
ing my entire time to my private prac
tice. This intimation has been perverted
so as to place me in the position of en
tering Into an agreement to the effect
that I should retain the office for a cer
tain time, and I wa3 then to retire to
make way for my successor. This la not
a fact. I have entered into no such
; agreement, and I have written to botn
Senator Perkins and Senator Bard that
any suggestion that I may have made
that I would retire at the end of this
year is withdrawn, and that my applica
tion to succeed myself should be acted
upon regardless of any statement from
me as to the length of time I should re
tain the position.
"Senator Bard said to me. and to a
number of business men of this city who
called on him in ray behalf, that some
time previous to March 6 of this year he
had said to Senator Perkins and others
that mv conduct of the office of United
States Attorney had given general satis
faction and that he had decided to in
dorse me for reappolntment. On March
6 he received a telegram from a number
of State Senators who had vo"ted for him
for United States Senator requesting that
he recommend the appointment of L. H.
Valentine, and he then decided that ho
could not refuse this request, and deter
mined to recommend Mr. Valentine.
"I have requested Senator Bard to file
my indorsements with the Department of
Justice, and I am willing to submit the
matter of my reappolntment upon the rec
ord I have made In the office and upon,
said indorsements.
"I want to say positively that It Is my
desire that definite action be taken upon
this matter before April 8. the time of
the expiration of my term of office."

At present the most talked of and the
most important event in tennis circles Is
the intercollegiate championship tourna
ment which will be played on April 20 at
the California Club courts. It was thÂ»
Intention of the tennis managers to hold
the matches at Berkeley, but as there Is
but one court there the idea was imprac
ticable.
A round robin tournament Is In prog
ress at Berkeley. In which Paul Selby
has beaten all of tho other four contest
ants and has thereby won a place on the :
singles team as well as the doubles. Selbv
deieated Drummond McGavin. Fred
Brown. Baker and Dibert. He had some
trouble beating McGavin, with whom it
wa . 3 ,?i c S? sary t0 P la y tno fu Â» five sets.
but he* disposed of the other three con
testants rather easily. But one other
match has been played, that between
Drummond McGavin and Fred Brown.
This was a most stubborn contest and
with two sets to the credit of each Mc-
Gavin finally won the deciding set, 10-8.
Reuben Hunt. California's strongest
player, has expressed his intention of tak
ing no part in the intercollegiate contests,
owing to a lack of time. Heretofore It
has been customary for three men to rep
resent each college, but with Hunt out of
It California will probably be represented
In both singles and doubles by Selby and
McGavin.
Collier and Crowell played a match on
Saturday at Stanford with Weihe and
Adams and one at Menlo on Sunday. The
ponies won on their own courts, but were
beaten at Menlo. Adams and Weihe hava
always been considered a stronger team
than their opponents, and the fact that
they only broke even with them shows
that, they will have to do considerable
practicing to beat the University of Cali
fornia doubles team-.
In the singles Weihe should have little
trouble in winnine his match, but thÂ«
other singles event will probably be won
by California, and thus the doubles will
be tho deciding event.
There will be a straight handicap sin
gles tournament on the local courts to
morrow. On Tuesday a tournament for
the. ladles* championship of Alameda
County and the GutteCup will be held
at Alameda. There is some doubt aa to
whether Miss Hunter or Mrs. Haslett Is
the present champion, and this question

The secretary of the California Coursing

the names of their last owners. . Copies

weighing slxty-ilve pounds. He is by
Lamberskat, out of : Quiver. Little is
known on this side of his qualifications as.
a courser, but the usual "wait till you'

and keeps the. local leash men guessing.
The dog will be left here In charge of a

The Ingleside Coursing Club held- its
annual meeting last Sunday at Vallejo.
Russell Allen's Hosie Clair and Daisy
Clair divided the stake. Andy Dean, who

who, when his own dogs were slipped,
stepped down and out in favor of, John

A bad feature of the meeting was . the
disgraceful performance of Pasha Queen,
whose work has furnished considerable
gossip in coursing circles. The field stew

Montana Jack, Loughneagh and -Honesty.
In the fourth, against , Rosle ; Clair,. she

evident that some stimulant stronger than
beef tea -had been administered to the
hound.' According tOi a -late: rule* witch
hazel Is allowed as a rub and; beef tea as
a stimulant. The finding of any, other rub
or stimulant in. the kennel or on the per
son of n licensed trainer, subjects him to
being ' ruled Â¦ off - for life. .If . the rule -is
strictly enforced it looks bad for the ken

courser was overdosed with whisky. Â¦Â¦--â¢'Â¦ .

OPEN STAKE AND
ANOTHER SAPLING
FOR UNION PARK
BERKELEY, March 29.â The Univer
sity of California athletes will hold their
annual interclass day to-morrow after
noon on the. cinder path for Individual
college championships. ' There will be
some exciting races and efforts will be
made to lower a few records.
Service will try to cut off some of the
seconds on the collese' one-mile run rec
ord of 4 :3S 1-5. held by E. J. Brown. His
condition is splendid and men -who havo
seen him at work believe he wMsucceed.
Track Captain Walsh looks for Service to
establish a new. record and win the gold
medal offered Â¦ by James Elliott " of the
Olympic Club for anv one who would
lower the present time. Walsh himself
will probably be sent out by Trainer
Christie to cut off a fow superfluous sec
onds of ' his . mile walk ; ; record.' I His time
of 7:24 has not been beaten by either col
lege and if lowered this year must be dona
by himself. , .
."One of the prettiest races of the day
will be the 100-yard dash. Cadojsran will
win, but there are five men : of almost
equal merit for second Dlace. The times
of four of them -at least are practically
the same and theman who follows Cado
gan past the tapÂ© la yet unpicked.- . The
men for second place are Squires, Hussey,
Brown,. Townsend" and Lldga. '
Â¦-Clifford; -: Pede will and Gustaf son . are
likely men for second . place in the mile
run. Bailey, Â¦ oh account of , illness, will
not compete. ' Gustaf son has been in prac
tice but a few. days, but Is showing:. good
form -; and ' remarkable staying 'powers.
Cadogan will get the 220-dash and Squires
the 440. Hamlln,' if he is in good condi
tion, ought to win . the ' 120 hurdles. Hia
baseball c practice has' kept him -off . the
track . and he Â¦ may be pressed hard for
flrsr place by neither Powell or Cheek.
' Of the freshmen who are developing into
good material Cheek is -one of'the most
promising. . Hels~taking. the hurdles m

among Powell, Cheek and Cooley. Hus
sey, who "Is going " to make a record - for
himself some. day cIosg. at hand," will win
the broad: jump. Topham of the medical

Union Park presents for its weekly
meeting a card which would be hard in

a great bunch of performers. Palo Alto
is. as usual, first choice for the stake.
With Hot Haste and Roman Athlete at
the top of'the card, Santonnl. Luxor and
Rural Artist at the bottom, the stake sug
gests some close going. Worship, winner
of last week's stake, is in again, but fig

so well along in the running against older
opponents. Homer Boy led everything
until near the close of the day, when he
was put out by Slsquoc. He is the only
one of the St. Clalr-Gilder litter that has
shown any speed.
George Sharman has Fine Fire in this
week's stake. It is expected that in the

there were speeches, toasts and a song by
"Judge" Keogh in honor of the new craft.
The skiff is very shallow, sits low In the
water and is rigged , low. - A. W. Pape,
after trial, said that she is very light, fast

TRACEY AFTER THURSTON.
Al Smith, who Is the manager of Tom
my Tracey, has deposited $50 with- the
sporting editor of The Call for a match
between Tracey and Thurston for $500 a
side. Smith will match TTacey with any
fighter under 14(1 pounds for $500. The de
posit money will â¢ remain for ten days.
The fight became gentler in spots aftor
this, Cribb evidently waiting for a finish
ing blow with his right. He used his
straight left and shot hl3 right In on
Thurston on more than one occas!on, but
the Flying Dutchman failed to weaken
fight took on its old pace in the seventh,
both men getting a chance to do damag
ing work. First it was 'Cribb and then
Thurston. At the wind-up Thurston was
butting his head into Cribb's right and
left, but the Australian was In no condi
tion to end the milling with a knockout
punch.
With all thÂ© light and shade of heavy
glove work the light advanced round by
round, until the thirteenth, when some
thing occurred which pulled the crowd
right out of the chairs and gave brave
Captain Wlttman a chance to show him
self. In a mlx-up Cribb undoubtedly hit
Thurston lower than the rules allow.
Thurston winced and backer away, claim
ing a foul. Alec Greggalns was up at tho
rope-i yelling for Referee Phil Wand to
stop the fight and declare his man the
Â¦winner. The spectators, shouting and
hissing, were equally excited, but all the
time Thurston continued his recessional
dance and protected himself from Cribb.
Then maddened and fierce he let loose, his
pain seemingly disappearing as If it had
been â¢ passed through a sieve. When the
gong sounded Thurston was again the
aggressor and Cribb was walking back
ward. Then it was that Captain Â¦Witt
ma n arose and said to the referee that
Cribb should be counseled against foul
fighting. Cribb was none too clean In his
work.
sufficiently for the reception -of. a knock
out blow, Cribb wms clearly tired * out
when the gong sounded at the close of thÂ«j
fight and Thurston not. so gingery, but
still aggressive. â¢ â >
The preliminaries were short affairs.
Denny Mahoney was satisfied with one
round and a half of thumping from the
gloves of Kid McFadden. The Kid re
peatedly knocked Mahoney down, but it
was not the force <^f the blows so much
as Mahoney's weakness. Mahoney was
clearly outclassed. In the second round lie
was so completely hors de combat that
Referee Phil Wand stopped the fight, pro
claiming McFadden the winner.
Tommy Cox found "that vulnerable
spot" on Jack Granfield's chin when the
second round was naif finished and Gran
field fell on his face. He remained just
that way for more than ten seconds and
was then packed to his corner by sur
prised seconds. Everything up to that
point had been progressing smoothly, both
men fighting earnestly and dividing the
honors. Then Cox scored the blow that
ended it allâ a right jolt on Granfield's
chin.

ROAD AND TRACK RACING.
pÂ»T|-^HE two fistic whirl winds, Otto
I Cribb and "Dutch" Thurston. met
j again last night at the Mechan
(I icE" Pavilion before the Xational
Sporting Club, and Alec Greg
eains' protege walked out of the ring at
the end of the twentieth round with Ch*
honors of victory and the entire purse of
fered. Two months ago, when these two
fighters clashed for the first time, they
were hailed as marvelsâ not for their
cleverness but for their physical game
ness and endurance. In a mild measure
they repealed last night their initial dual
performance before the San Francisco
ring pubJic.
For eight rounds the fighting was full
of the furv of the wind and the eurginfr
sea. Wficn'tSe referee gave the signal to
cut Ioofo Thurston and Cribb' came to
gether with all that wild dash and reck
l*>s=sn*ss that marked the first meet'ng.
The pacp that was set was Just as hot
and furious. This kept up with steady
continuity for five rounds, when a slight
Jull in the storm gave the spectators a
chance to catch breath. The fighters acted
as if they neither knew nor cared what
! reathlng or rest meant.
Thurston, following the instructions of
his seconds, waded in. He was wild, but
not bo wild sis two months ago. He
blocked in better fashion; he even pro
jected himself at times while delivering
a blow. But he has much to learn of the
jr&me puglli&tic. With his arms beating
about like flails he rJayed the aggressor
tor almcst the full twenty rounds. Fierce
buffeting on head and body fell from him
as if it were of no physical concern. He
Thirsted for punishment, and some that
be received was severe enough to make
any ordirary fighter wish for a quiet spot
beneath the trees with a fair sky over
head.
The Improvement in Thurston's form
saved him from the same kind of a "beat-
Ing that Cribb administerd in the last
fight. Th the fourth round, when all was
heavy fistic sailing on a gusty sea, Thurs
ton landed a wild left swing that atag
jrered Cribb for a momentâ but only for
a moment. The round ended with both
playing the proverbial hammer and tongs
act.

of the season with the Santa Clara boys
by a score of 8 to 7 to-day. The game

PUNCHING OF THE REFEREE.
DENVER. March 29.â At the end of a
ten-round go before the Colorado Athletic
Association here to-night between Dave
Barry of Toronto and Kid McPartland of
New York. Referee Floto. who is also
manager of the club, awarded the decision
to. McPartland. He immediately left the
ring amid the jeers of the entire audi
ence and followed by Pat Early, manager
for Barrv.
When the men reached the office of the
club Early struck Floto several times in
the face and was proceeding to pound him
when bystanders separated them. The po
lice cleared the house and prevented what
threatened for a time to become a riot.
The fight was even up to the filth round
when Barry began pounding McPartland's
heart with his right. He blocked nearly
all the kid's leads and landed his right in
return invariably. An old wound over
Dave's right eye was opened in the eighth
and bled profusely until the finish. Mc-
Partland was weak in the ninth from
Dave's persistent punching over the heart
and Barn- seemed to be the stronger at
the end. â¢ . .

would take the matter up and bring tha
problem to a conclusion at the next meet

The magnates of the California Base
ball League breathe easier, for the danger
of a boycott by the labor unions has
passed away. Henry Harris in particular,
at whose team and for whose punishment
the proposed boycott was aimed, is beam
ing with smiles and If a union man wants
anything of Henry he will get it. The
San Francisco Labor Council at its meet
ing last night effectively disposed of the
proposition to boycott the games of the
California League. .-. -
Recently the cigar store of Goodman &
Harris, at Stockton and Ellis streets, was
remodeled, the work being done by
West Coast Furniture Company, which,
employs "scab" labor. Air it happened.
Goodman let the contract for the work.
Harris being too busy with plans for the
coming baseball season, to give attention
to details of the cigar business. However.
P H McCarthy of the Building Trades
Council took the case in hand and urged
a boycott of the games in which Harris
baseball club should participate. Every
union man was to be forbidden to attend
The Varnishers' and Polishers' - Union
two weeks ago presented a request to the
Labor Council for an "unfair" notice
against the local baseball league for the
reason stated. Such notice was the first
step toward a boycott. Tne request went
to the executive committee for . recom
mendation. ;Â¦ .-;.,.,: . :
For two weeks Harris and his associates
in the California League have been busy
explaining the mistake that Henry's part
ner made. Members of the Labor Council
readily recognized the impossibility, of
boycotting the San Francisco club with
out injuring equally the other clubs,
against whom no shadow, of a grievance
existed. Last night the executive com
mittee recommended , that no action upon
the request for an - "unfair' notice be
taken and the report was unanimously
adopted. Delegates from the Varnishers 1
and Polishers' Union said they no longer
desired a boycott.
. When the season opens next Sunday the
financial support of the workingmen will
not be wanting.

Zschokke, the mile" walker, was the
other record-breaker. After distancing
Lewis, his closest rival, by a auarter of
a lap, he finished the mile in 7 mln. 21 sec.
beating the intercollegiate record by 4 2-5
seconds. y
Henley took the broad jump and hlgfi

THE big crowd of local turfgoers
that'.went r dowh. to Tanforan yes
terday to see the match race be
tween Kenilworth and Yellowtail
decided was augmented by a dele
gation of Oaklanders, all "rooters" for
Captain Hacketfs horse. In receipt of
thirteen pounds, eight out of every ten
turfites picked Yellowtail to beat the
three-year-old, but Harry Stover was
right, for Kenilworth won, "all out again
as usual." A pile, of coin was wagered
on the result, with Yellowtail always the
favorite, opening at 4 to 5 and closing at
3 to 4. , Six to 5 was the top quotation
about the brown colt. It was generally
conceded that if Yellowtail could outrun
Kenilworth the first part of it he would
win, but this he could not do. .Breaking:
away from a running start, Kenilworth, a
head to the good, thÂ«p)alr set a clip that
left a trail of smoke Behind. Turner rode
Kenilworth hard from the jump, leading
thejt>ig chestnut at" the end of the first
quarter, rattled off in :23S*. Aided by a stiff
breeze, the half was covered in :46%, and
as Kenilworth forged ahead, his admirers
let out a cheer. Just.before the turn for
home was reached-O'Connor, eased Yel
lowtail up a trifle, preparatory to making
one last desperate effort, for things looked
dark. Straightened â¢ away, ' O'Connor,
called on Yellowtail, and although weary,
he responded, but the three-year-old never
let up in his work and won by half a
length in- 1:14 flat. The sum of . $2500
hinged on the result, the owner :of each
horse putting up $11XW, with $500 added by
the association.
From-the commencement it was not a
particularly happy inning for favorites,
Waidman and Articulate being, the only
ones that "did_ not disappoint. Mounce

smart ones were down hook, line and

not in the best shape, although ruling fa- .

1 â ; ROM the Treasury Bureau of Statistics at Wash-
I ington there has just been issued a review of thj
Â¦*\ - trade and shipping carried on by United States'
merchant vessels on the Great Lakes, which is of i\\-\
terest to the larger subject of American shipping,
generally because it shows what can be done in the
way of building up a merchant marine where ample
pictection from foreign competition is afforded.
The lakes are small in comparison with the immense
frontage of the United States on the Pacific, the Gulf
and the Atlantic, but, small as the lake frontage is,
the increase in merchant" shipping on its waters is one
el the marvels of American enterprise.
It appears from the review that prior to 1890 the
bke tonnage in American vessels never reached an
aggregate of 1,000,000 tons. In that year the aggre
gate tonnage was 1,063,064 tons, and from that time,
until the present day an almost steady increase has
been noted. Never since 1889 has the total dropped
below the 1,000,000 mark, and with the single excep
tion of 1894 there has been no year wherein the ton
nage has not shown an increase over the preceding
twclvfc months. The minimum yearly increase dur
ing the decade was 14,039 tons, arid the maximum
&5.O35 tons, the latter having been in 1897,
while the year previous has a gain of 82,608 tons to its
credit. The aggregate tonnage om the lakes at the
close of the last, fiscal year (June 30, 1900) was
1,565,587 tons, a gain of 502,524 tons, or 32 per cent;
during the interim covered by the comparison.
. Passing from the tonnage carried to a consideration
of the shipping itself, the review gives the informa
tion that in 1 89 1, when the aggregate tonnage under
the. American flag was 4,684,759, the tonnage of the
lake craft amounted f .o 1,154,870 tons, or over 24 per
cent. The aggregate tonnage for the nation in
creased very gradually prior to 1900, and thus in
1896 and 1897, when heavy additions Were made To
the complement of fresh-water carriers,' the shipping
of the inland seas represented as high as 29 per cent
of the whole. According to the latest statistics com
piled by. the' United' States Commissioner of Navi
gation, the aggregate burden of "American vessels/ is
5.164,8.39 tons, and the Great Lakes shipping,' with
1,565,587 tons, thus embraces 30 per cent. /
When attention is cirected exclusively to iron an j
steel vessels the showing is much' more favorable 'o

CAUFORNIANS IN NEW YOBK
It is to be noted, moreover, that marine life is be
coming more and more interesting to mankind. Some
of the .ablest scientists of the day are devoting them
fclves to that study exclusively. It has been noted
that the aquarium at Naples has made that city a. cen
ter for sttrdents from all parts of the civilized worH.
A well planned and well maintained aquarium wotflcf
thtrefore be to San Francisco a most valuable addi
tioT. to her educational institutions and would soon
have a repute that would command the attention cf
i-ultured people in all parts of the globe.
We cannot of course expect to obtain a fully
equipped and comprehensive aquarium at once, but
we can at least make a beginning and lay the foun
dations upon which to build later on. There can be
no question that if well started the institution wouM
rapidly grow. The life of the. land shenvs no such
wonders as the life of the sea, and accordingly the
exhibits at the aquarium would soon attract so much
of public attention that men of wealth .would be glad
to co-operate in promoting the work and augment
ing the plant. Private generosity would thus follow
public enterprise, and it would not be very long bc
lore the San Francisco aquarium would be world
famous. An appropriation' for an aquarium is there
fore among the things which-the Park Commis
sioners e'an reasonably ask from the Supervisors
at the next tax levy, and the grant would meet with
public approval.
A further advantage which an aquarium in this city
would have over one in any other important city of
the world is to be found in the richness of the ma
rine life immediately available for it. We have the
Parjfic Ocean at our command, and in its waters and
along its shores are to be found a well nigh infinite
vnricty of the creatures of the sea. To gather fine
specimens of them would be a comparatively easy
ta;.k, while to make the collection complete would re
*,':ire years of work end thought, so that each suc
ceeding year would see marked improvements in the
exhibit, and popular interest in it would be con
tinually excited by the acquisition of new specimens
r.f the wonders of the deep.
Serious difficulties have to be overcome in the main
tenance of aquariums in New York or other local.
tÂ»e? where extremes of cold and heat are experienced
during the year. The water, which must be kept at a
temperature to suit marine life brought from tropic
seas, has to be artificially warmed, and consequently
llic expense? are large. No such difficulty would be
r.ei ir. establishing an aquarium at Golden Gate Park,
and no such expenditure for maintenance would be
ivqrired. The equable weather of our climate would
enable us to maintain tanks of large size suitable for
alJ kinds of sea plants, animals and fishes without hav
ing recourse to artificial heat to any considerable ex
tent at any period of the year.
\\ herever aquariums have been established they
Jiaie proven to be among the most interesting and
mo^t instructive of popular resorts. In New York
an aquarium was established some years ago at Castfe
Garden, and despite the fact that it stands in Battery
J-"ark. at the extreme lower end of the island, far re
moved from the residence districts, it has been found
tj be an attraction almost equal to Central Park it
pe:i. It is reported that since it has been open the
aÂ» trage attendance has been upward of 5000 a day."
bifiiijar successes have attended the aquariums at
Prighton and at Naples, and even in the smaller in
stitutions of the kind at Berlin and other cities of
Europe something of the same remarkable public ap
j rtciation has been manifested.
AMONG the many features that have been pro
vided at Golden Gate Park for the entertain
ment and instruction of the people there is
one notable omission. We have the beginnings at
least of an aviary, a zoological garden, a museum and
an art gallery, but we have nothing in the semblance
of un aquarium. The omission is the more strange
because of all the adornments possible to parks there
if rot one v.hich in San Francisco could be so easily
raited to ths first rank among things of its kind in

PERSONAL MENTION.
divided into three districts. â¢ It is provided in the last
section that the act is irrevocable and can never be
repealed without the consent of the majority of the
old ladies who have been regularly admitted to the
home.
A bill of that character of course cannot escape
criticism and even condemnation. It has been argued
that so far from encouraging matrimony it will have
an opposite effect. In fact, the Philadelphia Record
says: "A male person who waits forty years,
without trying to get married when the cost of a
Keystone license, is only 50 cents is not likely to be
spurred" into greater activity by a tax of $99,50 in
tended to. prick the sides of his intent. Nor after he
should go out of the State to wive him would he be
encouraged to return by a fine of $100. It
were better to stay in Chicago or Skaneateles than
to dwell in Highspire or Harrisburg on such terms.
Instead of encouraging matrimony the proposed law
would operate to promote depopulation."
.There are other objections made to the bill. It is
said that in Pennsylvania there are a considerable
number of bachelors who have reached 40 years
of age without having been able to find womenwho
would marry them. Should the measure go into
effect there would result the possibility that some
bachelor of 40 when at last he was' successful in.
l:is wooing might have in taking out a marriage li
cense-to-contribute to the support of some spinster
'.vho had refused him. That would be the uttermost
refinement of tyranny, and it is natural that an
aroused sense of justice should lead to protests
against the purposed iniquity of the man from Allen
town.
There are so many States in the Union that it might
I be possible to set apart'one of them for the purpose
of. making experiments with all such legislation as
this. It might be arranged that every reform crank
who believes in the statutory elevation of mankind,
and who succeeded in getting elected to the Legisla
ture of any commonwealth, should be sent to take his
seat in'the Legislature of the State assigned for the
experiment. Then the country would have a great
and variegated object lesson and an opportunity : for
inextinguishable laughter.
SOME days ago we directed attention to certain
examples pi reform by statute which are now
engaging the thoughts of the legislators of the
Eastern States. At that time it was noted that the
Wisconsin solons had before them a bill designed to
promote matrimony, and it is only fair, therefore, to
gi\e Pennsylvania c-edit for a similar good intention.
Representative Jeremiah Roth of Allcntown has in
troduced into the Legislature of that State a bill
v.hich he says is intended to encourage matrimony and
at the same time provide for the support of old maids
vho have had no chance to get married. It is there-,
fore a double-acting measure and merits at least a
parsing notice.
The bill provides that "any male citizen of the com
monwealth who is 21 years of age and desires the
office of husband may procure a license as prescribed
by existing laws, provided he is under 40 years of age;
but if the applicant is over 46 years of age he shall
before securing the license pay into the clerk of the
court's office $100 as. a license fee, which this bill im
poses on all bachelors over 40 years old." It is fur
ther provided that all the fees shall be turned into
the State treasury for the purpose of maintaining
three homes for old ladies over 40 years of age "who
have not had a suitable opportunity or offer of mar
riage, and have not means sufficient to keep them
selves in clothes and spending money." Any bache
lor ever 40 years of age who shall go to another Stats
and procure a wife and shall return to this State shall
pay into the State treasury the sum of $100, otherwise
tho marriage contract shall be declared null and. void;
"or any such bachelor coming from another State who
his married after the age of 40 years shall come un
der the same laws as a resident. The State must be

We want as little risk of such result as possible,
am' therefore are frank enough to dislike this smart
move by Chile.
. In war time â and there will be wars and fighting, as
in the past â an active enemy, with free admission to a
naval and coaling station like Jiquilisco Bay, coufi
ihrow its commerce destroyers over the line of the
"tieutral zone and make it more grievous than interest
ing for the merchant ships faring toward our canal.
Our Government should look alive and see to it
that no further aggressions escape notice, whether by
Chile or any other power.
We do not suppose it would be possible to have
joint occupancy of a naval station, sharing the con
cession with Chile, so if she get ahead of us we must
grin and bear it. To bear a thing of that kind is
2:hilosophical, but to grin is a sacrifice of which we
are hardly capable.
Salvador is not a maritime nation. Her exports
and imports have to be carried by other countries,
and it will surely pluck plumage from the wing of our
commercial pride if v:q find Chile carrying the Sal
vador output to the exclusion of our flag.
The issue is of real importance to our Pacific
coast. It involves bur easiest commercial intercourse
with Salvador, and an unscrupulous commercial rival
will not find it hard to make American commerce dif
ficult in those waters.
Unfortunately the administration at Washington
has been diverted from such concerns to the vast
complications caused by the Senate's course on the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty, and so while the husbandmen
slept the enemy has sown tares.
With no coaling place nor naval station our position
would be intolerable, especially if we have to watch
our canal with such a waspish and aggressive neigh
bor as Chile.
During the Spanish war her sympathies were bla
tantly pro-Spanish, and she did not fatigue herself in
nny labored attempt to conceal them. Of all the
So'.ith American countries she has shown the most
truculent spirit. After practically destroying Peru
she acted the part of spitfire toward Bolivia, has
snubbed the Argentine Republic, and would not hesi
tate to defy Brazil. Altogether she has the resources
and the defiant spirit to make her a power hard to
neighbor with, and we are not out hunting any more
of that kind of acquaintances.
With the canal built the United States will greatiy
reed a convenient coaling station and naval ren
dezvous, but it is jdifftcult to see where it can be had
if Chile accomplishes her purpose in Jiquilisco Bay.
I: will be easily seen that we need such facilities con
venient to the Pacific end of the canal far more than
v. e need to fortify the canal itself.
NEWS from Central. America makes it plain that
the United States is not alone in commercial
ambitions and aggressive enterprise. It- is an
nounccd here that Chile has an eye to .her position
for trade, and defense and proposes to secure it, as
Bryan wanted to get free silver, without the aid or
consent of any other nation.
South of the Mexican . line the Pacific coast is
lacking in safe and bnd-lockcd harbors. They. are
so scarce that the nation that secures .one has the dip-,
k.iratic laugh on those that wait and get left out.
The only such harbor of consequence on that entire
coastline is Jiquilisco Bay/in Salvador. It is an ample
harbor, with safe anchorage for a large fleet, and ap
proachable landings in abundance. In the bay are
large islands, ideal places for naval stations, out of
which another Esquimau can be easily made. The
commercial drainage to Jiquilisco Bay is valuable.
The San Miguel River debouches into the bay and is
navigable right up into the coffee-bearing region of
Usulutan, and around the bay are extensive and vir
gin forests.

GOSSIP FROM
LONDON'S WORLD ,
OF LETTERS
The pension laws of the United States r
provide for two. systems of pensioning.
Under the first system the pension Is
based, upon wound or injury received or
disease contracted while In the military or
naval service of the "United States and In
the line of duty. A' 'distinction Is created
by the law between disabilities originat
ing prior to March 4, 1861, and those in
curred after that 1 date, but as the great
bulk of disability pensions is based upon
service rendered since March 4, 1861, the
system established by the acts of July 11,
1SG2, and March 3, 1873, will first be dis
cussed. Three distinct classes of bene
ficiaries are provided for under these acts,
which constitute what is termed "the gen
eral laV' :
First â The officer, soldier, sailor or
marine who rendered the service.
Secondâ Their widows and minor chil
dren.
Thirdâ Their dependent parents and
brothers and sisters.
An application for pension properly exe
cuted must be liled in every case with the
Commissioner of Pensions. Upon appli
cation to him in. person or by letter by
any claimant or applicant for pension the
Commissioner of Pensions will furnish
such claimant or applicant, free of all ex
pense, all printed Instructions and forms
that may be necessary In establishing and
obtaining the claims.
Evidence of Wound or Disability.
- Declarations for pension "may be exe
cuted before any officer authorized to ad
minister oaths for general purposes in the
State, city or county where the officer re
sides. .The declaration should bear the
official seal of such officer. If he has one;
otherwise his official character must be
shown by the certificate of. a clerk of a
court. .
.In every case two identifying -witnesses
must certify to the applicant's Â¦ Identity
and state their means of Knowledge.
"The declaration in the case of the soldier
or sailor must set forth the following
points: All service rendered by claimant;
his personal description; full description'
of disability or, disabilities claimed, the
facts connected therewith and incurrence
thereof and his hospital treatment.
The declaration must be supported by
competent evidence, showing that the
soldier or sailor contracted the alleged
wound, injury or disability in the service
and line of duty. If the records of the
War Department show his treatment for
the alleged disability In the servfee no
further evidence is usually required as to
that fact, but in the case of the wound or
injury evidence is necessary to show the
time, place and circumstances under
which it was received, unless t^ie record
discloses that fact.
If there is no record of the alleged dis
ability in the War Department compe
tent testimony is required to show the
time and manner of its origin* The best
testimony upon this point is that of an
officer or two enlisted men. of the claim
ant's company having personal knowl
edge, of the facts." and the testimony of
the surgeon who treated him in* the ser
. vice. .
. Continuance of the Disability.
After the origin of the disability in the
service has been established the question
of continuance is one of great importance.
The continuance of- disability! from
causes alleged from the soldier's dis
charge must be proved In all claims based
upon disease, and. this should be done by.
medical evidence whenever that is ob
tainable. Any period after discharge that
cannot be. covered by medical evidence
should be covered by the testimony of two
or more neighbors or employers, giving a
specific history of the claimant's condi
tion from time to .time since his'dis
charge, describing his symptoms as well
as it is possible for witnesses who are not
physicians to do so. The claimant's pres
ent condition is of course shown on med
ical examination, by the examining sur
geons of the Pension Bureau. >
Claimants should use great care in the
selection of- their witnesses, j All testi
mony should be based upon actual per
sonal knowledge and not upon state
ments of the claimant or of others. Many
affidavits filed in pension claims are
found to be of no value, as they were giv
en merely as "an accommodation" and
were not based upon personal knowledge.
This frequently brings trouble upon the
witnesses and throws . a cloud upon the
entire claim. The facilities enjoyed by
the bureau for the cross-examination of
witnesses enable it thoroughly to sift the
evidence submitted, and to eliminate
from consideration all testimony shown to
be of no value.
Claims of Soldier's Widow.
When a soldier or sailor dies as a result
of disabilities contracted in service and
line of duty his widow or minor children
are entitled to pension. : '
A declaration In proper form is required,
which - should set forth' all the material
facts upon which the claim is based.
The declaration should bÂ£ accompanied
by a statement from the claimant showing
whether the soldier or his widow had been
married prior to their marriage to each
other, and if so whether such relation had
been terminated by death or divorce. I
Â¦ Proof is requiredâ the record if possible
â showing date and cause of -the soldier's
death and marriage of the claimant to the
. soldier. Also evidence is required showing
that the claimant lived with the soldier up
to the date of his death and that she wad
never divorced from him." If "the soldier
leffany children under 16 years of age the
dates of their birth must be shown by the
best evidence obtainable. Copies of city or
town" records, baptismal r.ecords or the
testimony of the attending physician con
stitute the best evidence on this point.
The widow's remarriage forfeits her title
to a pension from and after that date, and
therefore proof of continued widowhood ia
required. .â¢-..-
The widow Is entitled to a pe"hsion in her
own right and also to $2 a month addi
tional for each. minor child of the soldier
under the age of 16 years. If, however, the
soldier left any children under 16 . by a
former marriage the widow is entitled lo
the increase of their account only so long
as Â¦ she shall be . charged : with Â¦ their, care
and maintenance. For any period during
which they are not under her care the J2
a month is paid to their guardian upon
proper application and proof. ' â¢
Minor children of the soldier become en
titled- to pensions upon the death' or re
marriage of the widow, and the proof re
quired : in claims of ' minors is practically
the same as- In those : of widows.
] - 'An application by a guardian is accepted
in claims "of .minor children. Â¦
The pension ' to children Â¦ ceases when
they become 16 years of age.
. Dependent .Â¦ Parents and' Others. -
. : If a soldier or sailor dies of a disability
contracted in the service under such cir
cumstances as would have - entitled him
to a- pension, and. leaves neither widow
Â¦ nor minor child, â¢ certain dependent rela
tives ! of the soldier or sailor, if any v sur
' vive, may become entitled to a pension.
The mother is :â¢ first, entitled/then the
father, 'and then -'orphan - brothers an-1
sisters under -16 years of age, who are
pensioned jointly.
Declarations and proof in this class of
- cases are the same as in widow's claims,
except ; that Â» in ; a . mother's claim proof " of
marrlago is not required. h : In claims * of
mothers and fathers proof Is also required
showing 'that the aeft.no widow
or minor' child,' and that they, are at pres-
I entdependent on: her or, his: own manual
labor; being without I other present * means
of support than â¢ their own manual labor
or the contributions of others not legally
* bound for 'their, support:- '"
1 1n - claims - of â¢ dependent - sisters 'Â¦â¢ and
brothers proof. Is- also required showing
that theyÂ»were dependent in>whole;or, in
part on the soldler.'or sailor at- the time
i of : his ; death. â¢ '
- The -' second . system of ; pensioning is
created Â¦â¢: by -â¢ the : act ; of June 27, . 1SD0, â¢ as
amended by. the act;of May .Â»,-. 1900.
Pension under. this act:ls limited to per
' sons v regularly â¢ enlisted Â¦' or ; mustered ..Into
the military "or naval - ; -service, of Â¦-'.' the
United States > who served ; therein Â¦â¢ for
ninety days or more during the- war of
the rebellion, and were honorably dis
charged from the service. A declaration
is also required under this act in which
the necessary facts should be set forth.
In the case of a soldier or sailor his dis
abilities, not due to vicious habits, should
be fully stated In the declaration.
It will be remembered that under this
law each and every mental or physical In
firmity, of a permanent character, not due
to the applicant's- own vicious habits, is
duly considered.- and the rate of pension
to which the applicant is entitled is deter
mined by the degree to which all these In
firmities, whether minor or serious, when
considered tog-ether, render the appli
cant unable to earn a support by manual
labor.
How the Pension Is Granted.
Upon receipt of the application a med
ical examination is ordered. If the certifi
cate of the surgeons discloses the exist
ence of a disability not mentioned in the*
declaration the claimant is afforded an
opportunity of filing a supplemental affi
davit covering such disability. If more
than three months has elapsed between
the filing of the declaration and the med
ical examination evidence la usually re
quired showing the * claimant's physical
condition from the date of filing his appli
cation. \
A claimant who has reached the age of
75 years is allowed the maximum rate of
$12 a month under -the act of 1SDO. for
senility alone, even where there are no
special pensionable disabilities. A claim
ant who has attained the age of 65 years
is allowed at least the minimum rate un
der the act of 1S90, "unless he appears to
have unusual vigor and ability for the pr
formance of manual labor in one of that
age. The effect of partial senility Is con
sidered with other Infirmities, where there
are such, and the aggregate Incapacity is
rated. -Â»
If a soldier voluntarily served In the
Confederate army and afterward served
In the army or navy of the United States
during the war of the rebellion he has no
pensionable status under the act of June
27. 1S90.
Widows and Minor Children.
If any officer or enlisted man who served
ninety days or more In the army or navy
' of the United States or In Its marine corps
during the late war of the rebellion, and
who was honorably discharged, has died,
or shall hereafter die, leaving a widow
without other means of support than- her
dally labor, such widow shall, upon due
proof of her husband's death, without
proving his death to be the result of his
army service, be placed on the pension roll
from the date of the application under the
act of Juno 27. 1S90, the pension to con
Â¦ tlnue during her widowhood. It 19, pro
vided, however, that the widow shall have
i married the officer or enlisted man prior
â¢ to JUne 27, 1S90. otherwise there la no
title to pension under the act.
The act of May 9, 1W0, amended the act
â¢ of June 27. 1890, by accepting dependence
â¢ of a widow for pensionable purposes if
! she Is without means of support other
. than her dally labor and has an actual net
l income not exceeding $230 a year.
The additional pension of $2 a month for
â¢ each of the minor children of the soldier
! under the age of 16 years Is paid to tho
â¢ widow in the same manner and under thÂ»
came conditions as those provided undor
the general law.
, The rate of pension to widows under this
Â¦ act Is $S u month, regardless of the rank
held by the husband in the service.
> Applications of Widows.
I In order to secure the benefits of the act
; of May 9, 1900, a declaration must be filed
thereunder, whether a previous declara
| tion under the act o* June 27, 1890, had
, been filed or not. -
' Proof of the soldier's death, of his mar
: riage to the applicant and of her con
tinued widowhood and dates of birth of
" children Is required the same as in claims
T under. the general law. In addition, the
J claimant must file her statement showing
the amount and value of her possessions
and her yearly income from all sources.
This statement must be corroborated by
the testimony of at least two credible wit
Â¦ nesses, who have personal knowledge of
- the facts, and by a. certificate from the
" assessment records showing the amount,
" character and value of her property.
" Where the witnesses possess sufficient
' knowledge to describe the financial con
3 dition of the claimant the testimony above
7 Indicated is usually sufficient to establish
1 the claim.
â¢ In case of the death or remarriage of
I the widow the minor children of the sol
= dier under the age of 16 years become en
\ titled to the pension until they severally
â¢ attain the age of 16 years. If the children
were born of a marriage entered into sub
!j sequent to June 27, ISM), they have no title
0 to pension under this act.
Proof of dependence in a pecuniary point
of view is not necessary to establish a
t minor's pensionable status.
1 Applications for pension in behalf of j
"z minor children may be made by their next
friend, but before payment ia made a
, guardian must be appointed by a court of
.' competent Jurisdiction, to whom the pen
1 slon is paid.
, If a minor child becomes Insane, idiotic
" or otherwise permanently helpless before
Â» It attains the age of 16 years the pension
{? continues during the life of the child, or
5 during the period of such disability. But
a a child who becomes insane, idiotic or per
manently helpless after he or she has
Â® completed his or her sixteenth year is not
3 entitled to such continuance of pension.
e and there is no provision of law by which
6 a helpless or idiotic child, who was over
P 16 years of age at the death of the soldier
3 or sailor, can be pensioned.
e Increases of Pension.
0 The rates of pensions in the cases of
' r widows, minor children and dependent rel
e atives are fixed by law and are not sub
l " ject to change. But In the case of soldiers
and sailors who are pensioned on account
% of disability, either under the general law
" or the act of June 27. 1S0O. the law pro
's vides for the allowance of an Increased
rate for Increasing disabilities. It is also
!r provided that except in cases of "pÂ«rma
l- nent specific disabilities" no increase of
sr pension shall be allowed to commence
ie prior to the date of the examining sur
a geon's certificate establishing the same,
o made under tho pending claim for ln
g crease. The law provides further that In
â¢e this, as well as in all other cases, the cÂ«r-
S tiflcate of an examining surgeon or of a
12 board of examining surgeons shall be sub
n ject to the approval of the Commissioner
of Pensions.
i- An application for increase must there
i-. fore tbe filed, by the claimant, and this Is
:- usually all that is required in the way of
y evidence in a straight increase claim. An
order, for his medical examination is sent
'.& direct to the claimant, and such examin
ation usually determines the question as
n to whether an increased disability Is
shown. When application is made for one
of : the higher grades of pensionâ $30. $50
or $72 a month â medical evidence should
y accompany the ' application, showing the
<*â¢ exact physical condition of the claimant
m and the degree of disability from pen
w sloned causes.

So of the great steel vessels whose tonnage exceeds
1000 tons each, the lakes have more. in number and
of a. larger capacity than the Pacific, the Gulf and
the Atlantic combined.; The showing is highly cred
itable to the lake ports, but it is not creditable to the
nation as a whole. We give to our shipping on the
lakes full protection from foreign competition, but we
do not give any protection at all to American vessels
competing for the ocean trade, and until' there is a
change in that respect we shall continue to have this
disproportion between the lake* shipping and that of
the deep seas. Â¦
lantic and Gulf coasts numerically exceeds that on the
lakes by 137 per ; cent, in tonnage : the excess is less
than 1 1 per cent. To carry this comparison further,"
it may be of interest, to consider, the apportionment
of the larger iron and steel vesselsâ those of 1000

the 'United States and Hawaii of 778 vessels of
1,710,136 tons, there are to be found on the Great

RICHMOND, Va., March 3O.-The Jef
ferson Hotel in this city, which was erect
ed and furnished by the late Louis Glnter
at a cost of $1,000,000, was destroyed by
fire last night. The magnificent structure
covered a half-block in the ultra-fashion
able part of the city, and was built of
buff brick with granite foundation.
The flames were discovered in the upper
part of the Main street side shortly before
midnight, and in a ebon time that part
of the building? was a roaring furnace.
The fire, despite I every effort, continued
to spread, and at 1 o'clock this morning
all hope of saving any part of the struc
ture had been given up. The guests who
were first dTiven out of the Main street
portion of the hotel took refuge in the lob
by on the Franklin street side. There was
much excitement, especially among the
women, many cf whom had retired for the
night! Many persons lost all their ef
fects. Several persons were hurt by fall
ing down stairs. . One man had his hip
broken. No one perished in the flames.
The fire started in the linen-room from
a defective flue. The insurance is about
$6oO,000.
At 2 o'clock this (Saturday) morning it
is almost certain that not a vestige
of the hotel will be left. There were in
the hotel many works of art, including
Valentine's marble statue of Jefferson,
which stood in the Franklin street court.
This statue was lost.

possibility of peace in the Orient save by
administering to Russia a sound drubbing,
and Judging from the almost unanimous
voice of the native press, if the powers
do not take measures to curb her inso
lence and to rebuke her violations of good
faith, Japan will undertake the task alone.
Although there have as yet been no open
demonstrations of public feeling, the un
dercurrent of feeling is manifest, to the
most casual observer, and coupled with it
is evidence that the Government is pre
paring for the emergency with the utmost
possible diligence. Unceasing activity at
the various naval stations and yards is
reported and the nation is gathering its
resources and energies for the struggle
with its. northern neighbor.
It seems impossible that the rest of tho
world,, in view of the rankly insolent de
mands of Russia or of the obligation it is
under to Japan for the relief of the lega
tions, should stand calmly by while this
little empire tackles its. giant foe, but
from every point of view it is manifest
that both Government and people are
alive to the fact that it is now .or never,
and that the aggressions of Russia have
become a matter of life or death to Japan.
It is particularly unfortunate that the
crisis comes at a time when the Ministry
Is absorbed in Its struggle with the House
of Peers on a petty question of taxation.
The deadlock still continues.
The extraordinary strike of the Judges
is still on and, although the courts are
not brought to a standstill, there is a gen
eral demoralization sCriously retarding
business and giving rise to complaints of
unusual delay. There is talk of bringing
the recalcitrants before a disciplinary
court, but as the latter Is itself in sym
pathy with the strikers' cause this meas
ure seems hardly feasible. Among the 1700
judicial officials in Japan fully one-half
are said to have joined in the agitation.
Their action In the Toklo local court
amounted distinctly to a strike, for al
though the various barristers, suitors and
witnesses assembled as usual at the ap
pointed hour the Judges did not open the
court, but spent their time in secret dis
cussion.
The economic situation in Yokohama
continues decidedly depressed. The small
er banks are rumored to be in a perilous
condition and reports are rife as to the
shaky status of important foreign as well
as Japanese firms. The internal political
crisis, the upsetting of the hopes of peace
in China by Russian diplomatic maneuv
ers and the financial stringency have com
bined to cause a downfall in local stocks.
It Is a curious fact, however, that the de-'
pression seems as yet to bo of a local
rather than a general character, as busi
ness in Kobe and the southern cities is re
ported to be in a healthy condition.

has occurred to justify the Emperor's
words. It hints- that the revolution of
1848 'was not directed against the Hohen
zollern dynasty, and appeals "from the
ill informed Emperor to the Emperor
rightly informed." .
The . Vorwaerts cites a number of pre
vious .speeches of the Emperor exhorting
the soldiers to fight for him when neces
sary, and claims it has authentic infor
mation that his words were literally as
follows: â¢ . . â¢ Â¦
"If the city of Berlin should again.im
pudently and disobediently rise against
the King, as In 1848, then, my grenadiers,
it will be your duty, with the points of
your bayonet**, to annihilate the Impudent

see any occasion for ths Emperor's words,
since nobody in Berlin is thinking of a
revolution, and his Majesty's predecessors
repeatedly recognized the loyalty of Ber
lin's population.
Tho National Zcitung expresses its ina
bility to comprehend what current events
induced the Emperor to refer to the revo
lution of 1S48, and sayB it does not see nny
signs of his Majesty needing a bodyguard.
BERLIN, March 29.â The Conservative
papers to-day do not discuss Emperor
William's speech to the Emperor Alex

poppies, in great profusion, were banked
on the table. Branches representing a

added to the pleasure of the reunion. A

nufacturers in This Country
Branching Out to Supply Mex-
American manufacturers are groin* to make
& bid for the South American boot trade as
well aÂ« the European and Colonial. There is
f'.fo some talk cf an American factory being
s-.arted in the City of Mexico. Practically the
whole of the boots and shoes made In the
Vr.fted Prates rame formerly from the fac
t< lies situated in the East. IJoeton being: the
center. Latterly, however, tanneries have
*irung tip further weft, about Chicago espe
cially, to as to be near the supply of hem
lock bark. ThÂ» boot and shoe factories have
naturally followed suit, and consequently a
considerable pcrtior. of the trade haÂ« been
tal-.cr. out of the hard? of Eastern maker*,
pr.d they in turn have been obliged to lock
for other markets where they can dispose of
their roods. It is therefore from that quar
ter that British manufacturers must look for
thf- severest competition. It has been sue
csted that a combination of American manu
facturers should erect in different parts of
lUf world larpe warehouses in which could be
FUred the different kinds and sizes of boots
i>nd Fhoes. so that retailers could replenish
thrir rtocks as and when they required it.
The advantages of such a plan, should It be
tarried out. would be conriderable.
Improved Machinery in TJse.
Those in the trade will doubtless \m able to
ray whether the disadvantage cf having to
import th'.s' quantity of hides, bringing them
firm such srÂ«>t distances and paying 15 per
'Â¦<nt duty, fiayinjr higher wases than aÂ»v cus-
Kfflnr)- ia Europe and heavy railway and
ftesmer freights, are compensated for by itet
firfr cheaper bark; If not. there roust be some
t) ;r.g in the process of tanning that enables
the American tanners to compete with other
HUTHli+1 in their own market*. Needless to
pay only the latent improvements in the gen
eral process of tarnir.R are employed in the
T'riited Fiate*. It is the use of bo much im
proved machinery that enables the American
manufacturer to turn out such large quan
tities and do it so cheaply.
The I'nited Plates is a large Importer of
hirim. There were imported durinir the year
en'.'n* De-ember 31. 1900. S07.2S7.P24 hides,
valued at C10,TÂ«.OO7. of which 1^.792,222. valued
at Â£3.MS.?S7. wore hid** of cattle, which pay
import <!u.t-- of '.;. per cent ad valorem, and 69.
1T1.6W1. valued at Â£3.SC0.3:fl. were Â«roat skins.
which are admitted free of duty. Of the. total
Import* 12Â«.Â£Â£.2eÂ«. valued at Â£Â«.2SS,707. came
from K"jro;>e, and e6.J12.7sC. valued at Â£2.191,
4*1. cr.me from the East Indies.
V'hr th!f= Mate of affairs should be possible
1? not lit first Fight quite clear. It means
fithrr the Amerlcan-madf article is cheaper
than the nritis^-rr.ad* <jne. or that it is r>f
letter quality. Takir.R- it lor grants that the
British boots and fhoes are not inferior to
those of America, there mutt be some im
portant reason why the latter ehould cost less
than thr former. That America is a larpe ex
porter of leather to the I'nite-f) Kingdom shows
that they ran manufacture it cheaper. Con
eiderlr.tr that fo muih of the raw material has
to bÂ» lmi'onrd Into the [Jotted States by the
tanner*, there s^ems nr> reasjn why leather
t-hould not r** manufactured as Â£heao or
cheaper In the I'nited KinP'iom. This applies
especially to the finer qualities, such as patent
leather, p'.aze<j kl<l and others.
Therr- is no doubt that a* far as certain
class leather is conremod America poÂ»sesses
orvns;5'rab!e natural advnr.taees. There are
plentiful fupplie? of suitable hark crowing in
the different part? of the country and the tan
r'-riey haw been jilaced at no Rreat distance
from it. The hemlock bark, â¢which is that
mrtst used for tannin); sole leather, is obtained
fmrn the forests situated In the States of
Wisconsin and Michigan. It is also found In
New York and Pennsylvania, but the
supply is rapidly diminishing. For tanning:
the finer qualities t<f leather chemicals end ex
tracts are ueed, a large quantity of which ia

Theirs was a stormy passage from the

driven to the Cosmos Club, where they

Major General Shafter, whom General
Young: is to succeed as commander of .the
Department of California, called on the
latter and paid his respects. The two of

General Young is in splendid health. His
tall and robus.t figure does not give any
indication of the hard service he has seen
in the Philippines. With his usual mod

achievements, but he was eager to give
credit to those who served under him.

difficult but disagreeable," said General
Young. "As compared with campaigning

After the matter of the contempt pro
ceedings had been disposed of, counsel
representing Mrs. Hayden filed an answer
snd cross-complaint to the complaint for
divorce placed on record by Hayden some
months ago. In her answer Mrs. Hayden
denies that she has been guilty of im
proper conduct with any person, as al
leged by her husband. In her cross-com
plaint she sets forth many specific allega
tions of cruelty on the part of her huÂ»
band. She claims that on various occa
sions he beat her, knocked her down,
blackened her eves, choked her almost
into insensibility and concluded his round
of abuse by kicking her severely shortly
before her youngest child was born.
Mrs. Hayden further charges that her
husband's cruelty and evil disposition are
responsible for the death of her oldest son.
She avers that the child was taken ill and
lay between life and death for two weeks
before she could secure her husband's con
sent to send for a physician. When she
did, she declares. It was too late and the
boy died. The cross-complaint bristles
with similar allegations of cruelty, and
hence sensational developments are ex
pected Trhen the case is next called for
trial-^that is. If Hayden has obeyed the
order of court in the meantime and taken
up quarters other than the County Jail.
Â¦^Tdwin Hayden, president of the Hayden
Packing Company, was committed to jail
for contempt of court by Judge Kerrigan
yesterday. Hayden's contempt consisted
In a. refusal to obey an order of court
directing him to pay his wife, Josephine
D. Hayden, whom he is now suing for
divorce, alimony in the sum of $100. When
the case was called yesterday morning
Hayden appeared In court and said he
was financially unable to comply with the
order. 'Jud^e Kerrigan was of the opin
ion that Hayden's statement was not
based on fact, and he forthwith ordered
him into the custody of the Sheriff, there
to remain until the order had been com
plied with.

She alleges that he has called at her

CLAIMS HUSBAND
PERSECUTES HER
The further hearing of the case .will be
resumed on Monday morning at 10 o'clock,
and it is expected â¢ that ' the defense will
put : a handwriting expert on - the Â¦witness
stand in order, to break down the testi
mony of Kytka, ,/
Former City Treasurer Reis testified to
having 1 paid the salarv waixants produced
in evidence,-, but could not state to whom
they were paid.
j. Sullivan, the hodcarrier, testified that
he Â¦ did not â¢ kpow of another man of his
name, wcrkinsr In the Street Department
in August. 1898. , \
' Thomas F. Clark, called by the prose
cution, stated that his signature had been
forged to a number of salary warrants
shown, to 'him,', all of which warrants. It
is alleged, wero forged by McGlade. The
witness testified that none- of. the men in
whose:: favor , the warrants were drawn
had ever worked in the Street_Depart
ment in the months of July or. August,
1898.
Clark Tells of More Forgeries.
When Lennon sought further Informa
tion as to Kytka's "pistol pocket" the
witness stated that he was a ''dead shot"
and had winged a footpad in St. Louis
and also brought down enemies when he
was fighting in the Austrian army.
At one stage of the examination Lennon
reproved Kytka for v Impertinence, and
Eugene . Deuprey asked the court to ad
monish counsel for the defense. The
court aid so, and warned Lennon that he
must not repeat his conduct. Lennon in
formed Judge Melvin that an injustice
was being done to. him and practically
said that if Kytka had not started "mak
ing goo-goo eyes" he (the attorney) would
not have "retaliated."
The merry war between the aggressive
attorney and the loquacious handwriting:
expert was continued during the entire
day.. :
Lennon questioned Kytka as to the vari
ous styles of handwriting, but Kytka in
sisted that the "Spencerian" mode â¢ was
the basis of all the styles quoted by tho
attorney.
Lennon wanted to know If Kytka was
not the sworn enemy of McGlade and if
he did not carry a pistol to defend him
self against any attack of the defendant.
Kytka denied the allegation and virtually
'.'passed the lie" to Lennon, who claimed
that the expert had so claimed In a con
versation at the Palace Hotel a few* weeks
ago. Kytka admitted that he carried a
pistol, but did so to prevent any one tak
ing . from him "valuable papers in the
case he was engaged in."
Kytka Says He Is a Dead Shot.
With continued bickerings, objections,
exceptions, rulings of the court and roars
of laughter from the spectators the exam
ination of Kytka was proceeded with.
Lenncn then awitched off to the evi
dence of K,*. tka Riven in the Becker-Cree
gan fOi'KPry cases, and when Eugene Deu
prey sprung the ever-ready objection
Kytka raised a howl of laughter by say
ing: "Let me answer, his questions. He
Is only on a fishing expedition."
Attorney Lennon sourM to break down
the evidence of-Kytka as to the similarity
of the handwriting of McGlade and the
writing of the signatures on the alleged
forged salary warrants.
"When Lennon tried to ask Kytka what
muscles of the hand were required to
make certain "up strokes" and "down
strokes" the prosecution interjected an

â¢ Â¦ - _
NEW: YORK;: March . 29.â The Evening
Post has the following: â¢ President Burt
of the Â¦ Union Pacific "and President Hays
of the Southern Pacific, - ; : together . with
Secretary Miller of the Union Pacific, who
have been traveling together from the
Far West, were . at their offices in this
city to-day. Both officers have been in
specting the Central Pacific and other di
visions of; the Southern 'Pacific and will
submit -their :â¢ recommendations for im
provements and means of operation. Both
officers will â¢ remain here at least until
after the annual meeting of *tne Southern
Pacific, which will be held on April 3.
â¢ Â¦ Union :â¢ Pacific , officials : will be elected
into r- the â¢ Southern Pacific board at this
meeting. , The present board consists of
eleven members, with one vacancy, and it
is i probable that the new directors to bo
elected: will, constitute a majority of the
board. - .
Since the last annual meeting of South
ern Pacific shareholders the board has
been entirely Â¦ reconstructed, August Bel
mont, D. O. Mills, John W. Mackay, J. B.
Haggin going into the board last summer
at the request of C. P. Huntington, not
long before his death, together with C. H.
Tweed, B. Hawley and J. D. Probst.
President Hays and James Speyer were
elected in the fall. â¢
Besides Chairman Harrlman of the
Union Pacific, it is probable that Otto H.
Kuhn of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Goorge Gould
of the Missouri- Pacific and Jamea Still
man will go into the Southern Pacific
board.
The Mall and Express, discussing the
announcement that George J. Gould is to
enter the Southern Pacific directorate,
says:
"This Is -what Mr. Gould referred to
some time apo when he said that still
larger deals thA any that had been put
through were coming. f If the proposed
harmony of relations is established It will
enable the .Missouri Pacific and affiliated
lines to secure better terms on through
traffic to the Pacific Coast. On the north
the Missouri Pacific's business will go over
the Denver and Rio Grande to Ogden. an.l
thence over the Central Pacific to San
Francisco. On the south traffic will qn
over the Texas and Pacific to El. Paso
and thence over the Southern Pacific to
California points."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL, Mlnri.. March 29.â The Great
Northern made a record run from Seattle
to St. Paul with a train load of California
oranges in fifteen refrigerator cars, ar
riving here at noon to-day, being seventy
one Â¦ hours on the road. The distance Is
1&7. miles. The trip eclipses the furious
run from St. Paul to Seattle three years
ago, when this road carried a traJn load
of Alaskan reindeer in eighty-four hours.
Â¦ The oranges were delivered to the Great
Northern, at Seattle by boat from San
Francisco Monday. The warehousemen
worked all Monday night loading the or
anges into the refrigerator cars, and by
noon. Tuesday the record-breaking train
was off and away toward the Cascade
Mountains on Its long flight to St. Paul.
General Traffic Manager Clark says tho
train surpassed the schedule on the
Washington and the mountain divisions..
Tho record-breaker stopped only for
water and fuel, and several passenger
trains wtre left In the rear before the spe
cial started down the eastern slope of the
Rockies. This portion of the homestretch
.was entered early Thursday morning. Tho
Great Northern officials waited with In
terest the reports from- tho dispatcher's
office, .which, were sent in as soon as the
flyer passed each station.
About daybreak . the Â¦- train commenced
the run down the mountain slope. From
Cut Bank to Havre, Mont., is a distance
of 130 miles. The special ran down at the
rate ; of .thirty-five- miles an hour. An Im
pression â¢ of -the , fast rate , may be gained
from tho ; fact that a passenger train
which was following was left behind an
hour *Â¦ and ten minutes when the fast
freight reached Havre.
-The oranges were examined and found
to be in perfect condition. The cars were
at once distributed among the various St.
Paul-Chicago lines and started for the
East. ' Â¦:-Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ .-, Â¦

THANKFUL TO Mbs.PINKHAM
Letters Proving Positively that
there is No Medicine for Woman's
Ills Equal to Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound.
(jS .Â¦Â¦(HR5. ANNIE THOMPSONS |^y
(ALL LETTEBS XBZ PTTBUSEXD BT SPECIAL PZSXUSIOX)
"I cannot say enough in regard to Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
It has done me more good than all the doctors. I have been troubled with
female weakness in its worst form for about ten years. I had leucorrhoea
and was so weak that I could not do my housework.
I also had falling of the womb and inflammation of the womb and ovaries,
and at menstrual periods I suffered terribly. At times my back would ache
very hard. I could not lift anything or do any heavy work ; was not able to
stand on my feet long at a time. My husband spent hundreds of dollars for
doctors but they did me no good. My husband's sister wrote what the Vege-
table Compound had done for her, and wanted me to try it, but I did not then
think it would do me any good. After a time, I concluded to try it, and I can
truly say it does all that is claimed for it. Ten bottles of the Vegetable Com-
and seven packages of Sanative Wash have made a new woman of me, I have
had no wer%b trouble since taking the fifth bottle. I weigh more than I have
in years ; can do all my own housework, sleep well, have a pood appetite, and
now feel that life is worth living. I owe all to Lydia E. Pinkham's
etable Compound. I feel that it has saved my life and would not be with-
out it for anything. I am always glad to recommend it to all my sex, for I
know if they will follow Mrs. Pinkham's directions, they will be cured."
Gratefully yours, Mbs. Ajs'xie Thompson, South Hot Springs, Ark.

STICK RIGHT TO IT
And Coffee Will "Do You" Good and
Brown, if You Are Highly
Organized.
It Is remarkable how persistently men
or women will stick to a Â«3ruc through
thick and thin, even after they become
convinced that the drug Is slowly killing
them. .
Tliis Is Illustrated thousands of tim^s
every day. A cample case Is that of F.
I*. Wolford of Columbus. Ohio, who says
;ha.t all fcis life, since a boy when he be-
paiT drinking coffee, he has been any-
thing but robust, or even in what might
be termed good health. He has tried all
w>rts of <!ru^s and tonics and consulted
rr.ary doctors. He quit tobacco, avoided
all intoxicating drinks, stopped eating
pastry and took life easy as far as work
â¢was concerned, but the same old trouble
continued and he could not get well.
He Etuck to the coffee because, he said.
"I could not do without It. The climax
came about a year ago. I went all to
pieces with nervous prostration, neu-
rasthenia and insomnia. The physician
absolutely demanded t*:at I cease drink-
Ing coffee and put me on Postum Food
Coffee.
"I very much disliked to think that I
must take something In place of coffee,
but to my surprise I found that Postum
was so oVlicious and so exactly like first-
rlass Java coffee In taste that I got on
with it very well.
"After a few days I began to notice that
I craved Postum as much as I had the old
coffee, and the longer I use Postum the
more satisfied I become with it, until to-
day I look upon Postum as the 'real
thins' and the ordinary coffee as the 'sub-
stitute.'
"I would not rive one cup of Postum
for all the coffee that grows In Central
America, not only as a drink, but for
what It has done for my health. I have
built up again until I arh in better health
than I ever was. and owe- the entire
praise to Postum. It Is simply a case of
Iraving off a poison and using a healthrul
food drink, containing powerful elements
of nutrition.
"Many among: ray own friends have quit
f-offee and begun using Postum Food
Coffee: fflfljfftWflS
."Richard 'vrilhelm. 823 Hast Main
street, and his wife both suffered from
dyspepsia, but were cured by quitting cof-
fee and using Postum Food Coffe*.
"James Netikamp. a grocer on East Ful-
ton Btreet, had liver complaint. He has
been greatly benefited by leaving off coffee
and taking Postum.
"I can elvt) you the names of a. number
of others \rho have either been enUrely
cured or greatly benefited by the use of
Post tun."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK. March 23.-R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
The condition of general business is in more
respects satisfactory. The dry goods traders
gloomy, with further reductions In prices ' of
staple goods this week and demand failing to
increase with the 'shading of quotations, but
from every other department of business re
ports are cheerful and ihe outlook for a good
spring retail turn over Is encouraging. There
is little difficulty over : collections In any dl
tection.and the mercantile demand for money
from numerous quarters Is proof of the con
fidence felt among manufacturers and jobbers.
The labor situation is more tranquil. . Â¦ .
Aside from the expected advance in struct
ural shapes there Is comparative steadiness in
Iron and steel. After more or leas\ advance
every week for two months it is gratifying
to flnd that Bessemer pig remained seven days
without alteration. The tone Is flrm and pro
ducers report all recent cales for early delivery.
While exports of cruder forms are light, other
countries having reduced prices until compe
tition Is felt, there is no diminution In the
foreign demand for bridge material and other
finished products.
Prices of boots and shoes are well sustained
without any quotable change. New England
chops report fewer oniers, but most concerns
h.tve sufficient work for some months on old
contracts. Japanned g'seds and chromo patent
kid are In special request. Most lines of sole
leather are firmly held, while receipts of glazed
kid and patent leather are quickly absorbed. at
steady prices.
That the bottom price.s for wool have been
reached at last Is evidenced by the growing
unwillingness of holders to make concessions,
the greater activity of dealers and: indications
that purchases for speculation are of consid
erable volume. Transactions show a material
gain at the leading markets, while shipments
from Boston exceed those of preceding weeks.
Efforts to secure even fractional advances in
quotations, however, end negotiations. Manu
facturers are not inclined to accumulate stocks.
The new clip moves very slowly, consignors
accompanying shipments with Instructions not
to sell at current figures. ; .
It was not possible to maintain the small
recovery late last week In raw cotton and sub
sequent reaction established a new low record
for the crop year.
Wheat did not respon-1 to rumors of damage,
but found reason for strength in Atlantic ex
ports, including flour. In four weeks of 11,432.
847 bushels, against 6,073,762 bushels In 1900.
Failures for the week numbered 206 In the
United States, against 203 last year, and 29 in
Canada, acalnst 33 last year. J

NEW YORK. March 2.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was slack on the stock exchange
here to-day. London is beginning to antlclpats
the Easter holidays. The tone waa satisfac
tory. E\en Americans were affected. " That de
partment was idle â¢ and â¢ London was taking
In a leisurely fashion until New York caused
a hardening of prices by purchases of tha
Northern Pacific issues, Ontario and Weste-n
and a sharp spurt In New York Central. This
last was on bidding in the street after ths
close. Part of the late strength was attributed
to the reports of the deal for the control of
Mexican Central.
ixmcion Is now displaying no independence
whatever In Its trading in American stocks.
Everybody here Is simply following the New
York lead and the local market becomes dis
tinctly nervous on any breaJt In Wall street.
The bank has bought Â£502,000 of gold barb,
which came txpm India.
The market is beginning to pay back the

The. leading futures ranged as follows:
periods, while 'Â¦ the future, with some excep
tions, is viewed Â¦ with apparent confidence. ;. The
advance of . the ;' spring season , is, of course,
partly responsible for the feeling , above men
tioned, allowing as It does better opportunity
for e. ivider range of operations than was pos
sible In the . winter months. V: First Indications
as to crop prospects h.nd - outlook are . in the
main favorable. Bank clearings are- showing
steady gains over unprccedentedly large totals
a year ago. : Railway earnings testify an im
mense volume of merchandise passing into con
sumption and as for some time past the active
demand at advancing prices for iron and steel
is regarded as a reliable index of good general
trade to come.' Building is becoming more ac
tive and promises this spring to be the heaviest
for many-years past.- Hence the lumber trades
and all lines of builders' hardware note con
tinued growing activity. - The demand in the
latter line and in agricultural implements at
the West is. in fact,- most notable.
As pointed out a week ago there has been
an apparent turn; in the tide In the wool trade
even while some quotations are technically
lower. A good volume of business has been
done at the leading Eastern markets and values
as a whole are quite tlrm. Boston sales this
week are estimated to amount to nearly 6,000,
000 pounds, bought by two large mills, and
the stocks of - Montana wool have been well
cleared up. Â»
The boot and shoe trade is in good condition.
Another gain In shipments is Indicated this
week ar.d the total is 0C0O cases ahead of this
week last year, while the unfavorable balance
for the season has been cut down. - The situa
tion in leather. Is quite satisfactory and stocks
of sole leather are limited. Â¦. \
Â¦ There Is a little more doing in the- cereals
this week, j corn being especially active and in
the hands of a bull clique advanced ' to above
50 cents. Wheat was In better export demand
and strengthened' slightly in sympathy with
the coarser grain. . ' J
Iron and steel have made - steady, progress
alike in .the volume of sales and in the mat
ter of price. The long expected advance In
structural- material came this week with a
gain of $2 to $4 in beams, chains and similar
products. Other finished' products are active
and strong. â¢ Pig iron has been more active
than for some time past, a feature being re
ported sales at . Pittsburg I of 40,000 tons . of
Bessemer pig on a basis of $17 25 delivered at
Pittsburg: 2000 tons of billets are also reported
sold at $24. Â¦ At least twenty Mahonlng, Slie
rango and . Cleveland district furnaces are re
ported In combination to Improve the situa
tion as 1 to - Bessemer rig. - The feeling . grows
that iron ore prices will not be far from $4 50
per ton. Current export figures point to smaller
shipments of goods - abroad,-, but the strength
noted In foreign market3 last week may post
pone-and even temporarily avert the decline
of our, export business. : -â¢
Wheat, including fluur, shipments ..for the
week aggregate 4,494,633 bushels, against 3,256,
644 bushels last week, 2.962,349 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1S00. 3.988,238 bushels In

The secret conference of President
James J. Hill of the Great Northern.
Charles E. Perkins, chairman of ths
Burlington board of directors, and ex-
Senator Wolcott of Colorado at the Vic
toria Hotel in this city on Wednesday la
believed to have settled the question.
The plan provides, it is said, fdr the pur

per cent guaranteed bonds, or fisi) cash.
It Is not known whether the proposition
contained a* guarantee to the stockholders
of the proposed 7 per cent. The large
Burlington stockholders do not manifest
pleasure over the rumors of the deal.
The plans were laid some time ago. "Wed
nesday's conference was prolonged, and at

cott hurriedly departed for the West. Mr.
Wolcott had been in Boston since March
17 Â¦ talking Â¦ over matters pertaining to tha

could give no new light on the report that
the Northern Pacific and Great Northern
interests had gained control of the v Bur

the dark-as to the facts. In financial cir
cles it i3 believed that President Hill of
the Great Northern is in. such a position
that his large holdings in Burlington and
strong backing in hi3 purpose to lease
Burlington Â¦ will force the Burlington di
rectors to give more serious consideration
to the offer of a guarantee on. the stock

Conditions Named for Trans

United States must Grant Concessions
but the Lease Will Be Offered
Â¦ ' on Most Advantageous . -^:
Terms. fulfil
Colombia will not grant sovereignty over
the strip of territory involved in the 'con
struction of the canal, but sha is willing
to make a lease on highly advantageous
terms to the United States. Senor Silva
refers to the concession held by the Pan
ama Canal Company, but he indicates that
his Government is willing to negotiate di
rectly with the United States and leave
tho question of compensation the French
company shall receive to negotiations to
be conducted by the United States anil
the company. Colombia desired that her
vessels shall be allowed to freely traverse
the canal, and she alao wants compensa
tion, either annually or in a lump sum.
M. Huntin, president of the Panama
Canal Company, who is still in Washing
ton, is satisfied that Colombia will carÂ©
for the interests of the* company, and it is
possible the question of the amount to be
paid to the company will be brought up
in negotiations between Secretary Hay
and Senor Sllva.
Secretary Hay is indisposed to actively
push negotiations with Colombia until
after the treaty with Great Britain modi
fying the Clayton-Bulwer convention 13
signed. Senor Sllva is anxious that the
two Governments shall first arrange a.
protocol similar to that signed with Nica
ragua and Costa Rica, and when this pre
liminary convention has been disposed of
that they shall proceed to negotiate the
treaty. Secretary Hay will be willing to
8lgm the protocol provided a satisfactory
agreement can be reached, but he will not
negotiate the treaty with Colombia until
Congress has authorized the construction
of the canal.
CALL, BUREAU. H06 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, March Â©.-Colombia
has formally presented to the United
States her proposals for the transfer to
this Government of the Panama canal
concession. The exact terms offered can
not be obtained, but enough is learned to
show that Senor Sllva. the Colombian
Minister, has not departed from the ver
bal suggestions be made to Secretary
Hay.

In November MacCausland was cap
tured by a Sheriff's posse near Holbrook.*
He had terrorized .the populace by- his
weird screaming around the camps ac
night and by appearing- among' the super
stitious miners and woodmenlat unexpect
ed times, his long sojourn in the wilder
ness having given him the appearance of
a creature half-animal, half-man. For
several months he had existed In the for
est, living on wild birds, eggs and fowls
and what he could steal from camps.
After his capture he was adjudged insane
and committed to the asylum here.
As MacCausland left the carriage to be
taken into the hospital he broke away
from Deputy Sheriff Bargeman and ran.
Bargeman drew his revolver and fired
into the ground to frighten MacCauslaxid
into stopping. The bullet glanced and
struck the maniac in the back, penetrat
ing the abdomen. , MacCausland died the
following day.
Dr. W. H. Ward, superintendent of the
asylum^ has just given out further par
ticulars of the case. As soon as MacCaus
land was Btruck by Bargeman's bullet his
wandering reason returned, and before his
death he told the strange story of his life.
He was 27 years old and the only son of.
William Sanderson .MacCausland of Gal
wally Park, Belfast. He was the "black
sheep" of the family and after a dissi
pated career wag disinherited. He came
to America, and during a fight In a min
ing town was shot In the head. The in-
Jury to his brain, where the bullet re
mained, caused insanity, and since then
he had lived like an animal In the forest.
MacCausIand's relatives have just com
pleted an investigation of his death and
removed the body to the parental estate.
PHOENIX, Ariz., March 29.-It has just
Jieen learned .here that Robert MacCaus
land, the "wild man of Arizona," who for
weeks last fall kept lumber and ralnins
camps in the northern part of the Terri
tory in a state of panic and wia finally
killed here, was descended from .an an
cient and honorable family in Ireland.

terday in the case of John E. English and
others against the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company for damages for having been
fed on bad food on the Rio. de Janeiro.
Several petty officers and members of the
crew of the Rio de Janeiro testified that
the European stee/age was on the main
deck and the Asiatic steerage was below,
but that when the European steerage was
overcrowded the overflow passengers were
placed on' the samo deck as the Asiatic
steerage, separated from -it by-a canvas
curtain or partition. The witnesses testi
fied a!so that the food supplied to the
plaintiffs was not "rancid and rotten." as
alleged, but that it was the same quaiity
of food as that served the petty officers
of the Rio. and that it cost much more
than did the food furnished to the Chi
nese. Quartermaster Lindstrom said 'that
Chinese and Japanese passengers were fed
on next to nothing, and that most of them
brought food with them. *

As there will be a complete change of

some change in the aspect of the litiga
tion that has piled up over the city. The

This change of administration will make
some changes about the City Hall. James
A. Johnson, City Attorney-elect, has an
nounced that he will retain present Dep
uty City Attorney Condon as his deputy.
City Engineer-elect F. C. Turner will ap
point David Brown, a brother of Chair

City Central Committee, his chief deputy,
and will retain the services of Charles E.
Proctor, field man, and Miss Maud M.
Dent in' the office. City Treasurer Tay
lor will appoint E. S. Finch his. chief
deputy, will retain Charles Cole, at pres

as special deputies William T. Dickenson.

swindling Griffln out of $97 5a and
Goertz out of $53 by what is
known as the "plate game" in a shed at
tached to photopraph parlors at the Cliff
House. After losing their monev they
were very indignant and readily swore to
warrants for the arrest of the defendants,
1-ut the police now believe that they have
received back their money and have left
the city.
G<>ertz was at police headquarters
Thursday night and stated that he had
got back $40. with the promise of more,
but he would be in court in the morning.
The presumption is that both have re
ceived the full p. mounts of their losses.
Attorney Arthur Mack appears for the de
fendants.

It lz equally true in the use of medl-

their existence was known the knowledge
of how to use them was lacking:.
They became valuable to the human

The grip iÂ» Â«n old disease Trtth a new
name: it is really catarrhal in character
arjl the usual symptoms are those of
acute catarrh, but the old-time catarrh
pow.lers, salves and pprays do not cure it,
. nfithÂ»r does the application of antiseptics
through an inhaler eive anything more
than relief for a short time.
Thf antiseptics are all right; they will
kill the perms of catarrh and grip If they
are applied rightly, but their local appli-
cation to the nose and throat avail little
because the perms are In the blood and
through tbe whole Fj'stem.
â¢ Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain many
of these same antiseptics, that aro used
In f prays and Inhalers, but Instead of ap-
plylru them *o the inflamed membranes !
ot the nose and throat, they are taken. ;
Into the. stomach and thus reach tho blood,
Â¦ he real seat of the disease, and drive out '
the Infectious germs through the natural 'Â¦
channels of the bowels and kidneys.
In ether words Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
reach the cause of the mischief instead of
merely local symptoms.
The remarkable success of these tablets
in curing grip, catarrh ami throat and
lung troubles is because they drive the ca-
iarrhal poison from the system and the
nose and throat become clear of the ex-
cessivc secretion of mucus, which causes
the hawking, spitting and gagging, be-
cause the secretion is not supplied from
\ healthy blood. .
Ll Two years ago Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
â¢ were unknown, but to-day have become so
popular through positive merit that drug-
gists everywhere tn the United States.
Canada and Creat Britain now sell them.-

Â¦It floes not look as it there will be any
money appropriated ioi a Hawaiian ex
hibit at the Buffalo exhibition. The sug
gestion has not met with much favor
owing to more important matters demand
ing public attention.
There has been no change in the strtke
of the machinists at the Honolulu Iron
Works. Two representatives of the com
pany were dispatched on the steamship
Gaelic on the ISth for the purpose of se
curing machinists to take the places mads
vacant by the strike. So anxious was the
company to secure the men at an early
date that a fine of $200 for each representa
tive was paid the agent of the steamship
line to pay the Collector of the Port at
San Francisco in oraer that the agentn
could travel on a vessel of foreign regis
ter between two American ports. Â¦,".--
The steamship Zealandia arrived this
morning eight days from Port Los Ange
les with 545 Porto Ricau laborers aboard
for service on the various sugar planta
tions. The crowd appeared to be much
stronger and' healthier than any- other
shipment which has reached here from
Porto Rico. There were two deaths on
the voyage.
The visiting Shriners expect to leave for
home April 2. On the evening of the 18th
the nobles and their wives were the guests
at an elaborate banquet tendered byth.3
members of Aloha Temple, which was or
ganized here last Â«w?ek. The following
day many of the Shriners took passage for
the island of Hawaii to visit the volcano
of Kilauea. A ball was also given the
Shriners the night of the 20th, the Terri
torial band being in attendance.
Shriners Soon to Return.
The storm occurred in darkness and all
that could be done was to heave to on the
starboard tack. The next day Captain
Glbbs went before the wind back toward
the Pacific Coast. For two days he kept
this course, cutting away the wreckage,
but when within 200 miles of San Francis
co a strong northerly wind was encoun
tered, which carried the vessel into the
p"ort of Honolulu under a jury rig. Thy
lost sailor was about 38 years of age and
shipped in San Francisco.
Both the main and mlzzen masts suf
fered, too, for the report of the break-
Ing foremast had scarcely died away be
fore a second : report came and' every,
thing above the main topmast head went
toppling into the sea. The mlzzen topmast
was next carried awav. All of the wreck
age was carried clear of the ship's sides
and absolutely no damage was done to her
hull or the livestock on deck. .
Timbers Crash on Backs.
Two of the sailors, Frank Behlander and
Frank Anderson, were carried over the
shin's side with the mass of wreckage
Benlander is thought to have been struck
by a falling piece of timber and rendered
unconscious, for nothing was seen or
heard of him after the 'rigging, was car
ried away. Anderson scramble! on the
spar ' and was rescued by the crew. He
was badly Injured by the fall.
The vessel left Ban Francisco February
13 with a general cargo and a deckload of
a dozen cattle and a quantity of bricks.
Fair weather was experienced' until the
ninth day out, about 400 miles south of
San Francisco. Captain Glbbs saw that a
storm was brewing and ordered sail short
ened. Only the fore lower topsail, fore
sail and spanker were set about 8 o'clock
at night, when a terrible hurricane struck;
the vessel from the tfest-southttest. A
part of the crew was on the fore lower
topsail yard when the storm struck tho
vessel. The foremast snapped - at the
doublins by the lower ma&thead, carrying
everything above with it. '
HONOLULU, H. T., March 23.â After
being thirty-three days out from San
Francisco the bark Olympic, Captain
Oibbs, arrived in port the morning of the
18th with her masts ' nearly gone and one
member of the crew missing 1 .' A sudden

GARBENâ SCHMIDTâ In this city, March 17,
1901, by the Rev. J. H. Schroeder, John Gar-
ben and Ella Schmidt. - Â¦- .irMHlWprWHBBWslMrs. Ellen C. Sargent, widow of the late
Senator Aaron Sargent, accompanied by a
majority of those ladies of this city who
believe In woman suffrage and kindred
privileges, had com% to court to press
her suit against the city and county for
the recovery of $440 94, taxes paid into the
local treasury under protest. Mrs. Sar
gent does not wish to avoid the payment
of taxes, but if she must pay them she
asks the right to vote; to be represented,
together with all of her sex, who must
also bear their share of the burdens of
government, in those conventions which
fix the tax levy. *
Mrk Sargent protested and now pro
tests against the burden imposed upon her
on the ground "that all political power is
inherent in the people and that govern

curity and benefit of the people and that

that the demurrer to the complaint should

sufficient and that it stated facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action.

the recovery of the $440 94 on the ground

The absolute confidence which has hith

the commercial companies and their
agents doing. business In the canneries in
Alaska .is* considerably on the wane. It
has been the custom for years past to ad
vance.- these workingmen , money In sums
ranging from $100 to $150 as soon as they
sign as employes* and .before leaving: for
the fishing Â¦ grounds. As a rule the Mon
golians were faithful and, kept their con
tracts, but this year nearly 200 of them
are on the delinquent list, and-the com
panies will lose many thousands of "dol
lars. * In .' some cases the â¢ men are â¢ found
to have signed agreements to , work for
several companies and drew advance
money from each, receiving for. their mis
representation nearly. $600 apiece.

The accused policeman denies that h<t
saw Walters pass any money to his vic
tim. His only excuse for not having ar
rested Walters at the time was that Rob
inson refused to appear against him. This
is strenuously denied by. the victim of the
bunko gang. He Bays,lhat he requested
Colen to arrest Walters but he refused
claiming that as he did not witness the
robbery he was powerless to take him into
custody. -
As Robinson could not identify Walters
as being one of the men who â¢ separated
him from his money Chief Sullivan re
leased him on his promise to Â¦â¢ find the
guilty parties.
Realizing the lncompolency of Captain
of Detectives Seymour In obtaining, evi
dence against Colen and the band of con
fidence -men- Chief Sui'i van turned < tho
case over to Captain Wittman. The lat
ter, after. satisfying himself that Walters
was the main conspirator, arrested him
and locked him up in the tanks. - Â¦ â¢;Â¦ â¢
It was not until one of Seymour's blun
dering sleuths apprised him of the arrest
that tie learned that the robbery had been
committed.
Formal charges of compounding a felony
and neglect of duty in. failing to make, a
written report of the occurrence were
yesterday filed against Policeman Colen,
who is accused by J. A. Robinson, a re
cent arrival from tho interior, of shielding
Harry Walters, the king of bunko men,
end his ilk. Robinson claims that <. after
he had been robbed by the gang Colen, to
whom he. had reported his loss. Induced
Walters to return part of the amount, but
made no effort to arrest the sharpers. He
also failed to report the robbery to his su
perior officers.
Walters, who had been arrested Thurs
day evening, was taken from his cell In
the City Prison to tho office of the Chief
of .Police and there closely questioned.
He at first denied that he knew anything
of the transaction, but finally admitted
that he had represented , himself as At
torney Arthur Mack to Robinson and
after considerable trouble Induced him . to
accept half of the amount he had lost.
Colen, so Walters claims, stood by when,
the money was returned to Robinson. â¢-.

they have the right to alter or reform the
same whenever the public good may re

Some time prior to the institution of the
action Mrs. Sargent prepared her case.
In September. 1S99. she applied to the Reg
istrar for leave to register. He refused
her application on the ground that she
was not a male citizen. On election day
r.he went to a voting booth and demanded
that the right to vote be extended her.
She was refused on the ground that she
was not a male citizen. Karly in. 1900 her
property was assessed and she was com
pelled to pay taxes In, the sum of $440 94.
When she paid the sum named into the
treasury she filed the protest quoted
above. Â¦;"'' ' â¢..* .
agreeing that counsel was right. The
bailiff rapped for order and the argument
continued. . ...
Mr. Sargent said the section of the con
stitution limiting the right of suffrage to
male citizens was in conflict with that
section which states "that all political
power is inherent â¢ in the people." . In
other words, his "point was that â¢women
are "people" and hence under the consti
tution political power is "inherent" In
them as much, as it is in the other sex.
"Under this reasoning, he contended,, they
should either be given the right to vote
or permission to refuse to pay taxes. He
did not state, however, that if immunity
from taxation was extended to women It
would-be a problem to find a married man
who was not a pauper or a wife without
money.: ; .
a After suggesting 1 ' that the course being
pursued by Mrs. Sargent was not a proper
one; that she should institute mandamus
proceedings against the Registrar to com
pel him to register hex. Instead of suing
for the .return of taxes. Attorney "Walter
Dorn, representing the city and county,
handed the court a list of authorities in
support of his demurrer. This ended his
argument and 'the- case was submitted.
The ladies in the case rounded up the
argument when they reached the corridor
and it is said that some of the more ar
dent stipporters of woman's suffrage
"really" believe they will get a favorable
decision. . : .".

LABOR .UNIONS PROGRESSING.
Council Receives Flattering Reports
A temporary organization was effected,
but it will not be made permanent until
all the other large centers have been vis
ited, which will be done as soon as prac
ticable. .
Then came the line-up. First, the yard
men were singled out and seated, others
followiiiR as fast as the Investigating
committees could pick them out. No one
who failed to pass the scrutiny was al
lowed to remain in the room. The doors
were closed and for nearly three hours
matters were discussed.
The principal point at Issue was the
formation of a union to include all
branches that were represented at thÂ»
meeting and to extend the plan to the
other large railroad centers throughout
the State wtih a view "of resisting," as
one speaker put it. "the threatened in
crease in hours of labor and decrease in
pay." Many of the remarks of the speak
ers were loudly applauded.
â¢ "We don't want this matter to get into
the papers," said the organizer of the
movement. "We don't want big scare
headlines to proclaim to the public and
our employers what we are going to do.
"Let the freight clerks, the men from
the ticket auditor's office, the yardmen,
the switchmen and the other branches
present select and pass upon the creden
tials of the men with whom they arc ac
quainted." .
Great care was exercised that none but
railroad men should be admitted. As soon
as the hall was filled the men were lined
up on one side of the room.
Fully 500 employes of the Southern Pa
cific Company, mainly drawn from the
men employed in the yards and offices at
Fourth and Townsend streets, met last
night at Pythian Castle to form a union
for mutual protection and to arrange to
resist the increase in hours and decrease
in â¢ pay which seems to be threatening
them.
"Captain" Frank E. Webb, the well
known traveling: man for Murphy. Grant
& Co., and renowned as a "bon vivant"
Â¦ nd entertainer. Is no longer a represen
tative for the big dry goods house, and.
but for the aid of friends, a charge of
using the firm's money would have been
placed against him on the blotter of the
Police Department, within the past few
days.
\\>bb. who is known to have a "cham
pagne appetite on a beer Income," has
fallen from srace on account of lavish at
tention to the fair sex. and to one par
licular demoiselle from San Jose.
<TbÂ«? first intimation received by Murphy,
Grant & Co. that their debonair repre
sentative had "gone wrong" was when
the Snn sent a bill for fifteen hundred odd
dollars to a customer In San Jose. Word
was quickly eent back that the amount
had been paid. Investigation showed that
Webb had secured sundry sums from the
San Jore customer, invariably giving his
personal receipt for the money. On one
occasion be had eigned his name for $2S5
"per Murphy. Grant & Co.," and this
transaction gave the big dry goods house
a. chance for action.
The San Jose customer was called into
consultation and Webb was given the al
t^raative of settling or being prosecuted.
Murphy. Grant & Co. yesterday received
SCS5 from Webb's friends, but the San
Jose customer, at the last moment, de
rlined to make a settlement for the money
it had advanced Webb on the supposition
that he was making collections for his
r-mploy*-rs. Webb and his friends are
wondering what the San Jose people In
tend 10 do. Meanwhile Pinkerton detec
tives are chaperoning Webb around the
â¢â¢r*d light" district.
W^bb is well known in theatrical circles.
l!r has Kiven many gay supper parties to
ladies of the ballet and actresses in a
<-ozy flat on California street, near Powell.
.Webb lias military tastes, and dozens of
liis lady friends cherish his photos taken
a la militaire. Webb's stories that he
fought through the Cuban war are fic
tions, and those who know him laugh at
tlie "scars" he was so fond "of showing
as having been received from the Span
ish enemy.
Webb belongs to a good family In San.
Jose, and he recently receded word that
political influence had secured for him a
lieutenancy in the regular army. In the
faco of Webb's recent escapade, it is not
thought likely that President McKinley
will recommend him to wear the shoulder
straps of an officer in the army.
