BARGE CREWS PRACTICING ON THE THAMES FOR THE HENLEY RE
GATTA AND. THE POINTS OF STARTING AND FINISHING IN THE
CONTESTS FOR THE VARIOUS PRIZES. '
HENLEY, England, July 2.â Owing
to the large number of entries
for the Thames challenge cup
at the Henley regatta, which
commences to-morrow, three
heats in the contest for that trophy were
rowed this afternoon. The results were
as follows:
First heatâ Trinity Hall, Cambridge,
beat the Vesta Rowing Club. The Cam-,
bridge men led throughout and paddled
home six lengths ahead in 7:35.
Second heatâ The School of Mines won
by a length and three-quarters. Time,
7:33. I .'
Third heatâ Kingston beat the Thames
Rowing Club by two lengths. Time, 7:57.
The heats were rowed under depressing
conditions, with heavy .clouds and occa-.
sional rain. The weather prospects" for.
the formal opening of the regatta to-mor
row are not promising.
Americans Are Confident. .
The oarsmen of the Pennsylvania Unl- .
verslty did only routine work. this morn
ing The Belgian crew's rowing was the
feature of the niornlng's work. They ere- :
ated such a favorable impression that
many of the spectators thought it quite
possible that they would beat Leander in
the trial heat, in which, case the Ameri
cans and Belgians would in all probability |
meet in the Grand Challenge cup final.
The . American crew will have ' its Â¦ first
race over the Henley course > to-morrow.
The members of the crew themselves ate
very confident, not only of the result of
the race Â¦with the London Club, but they
are also confident of winning the final on
Friday. The general . opinion of rowing
men here to-night, however. Is that Le
ander is sure to win in the final, and from -
more than one quarter the correspondent
hears the opinion expressed that at least
two of" the Pennsylvanlans are over
trained.. There was little evidence of this
when the American oarsmen came in from
their paddle this, afternoon. They all
looked, fit. Coach Ward, who stood by:
and noted his men with approving glances !
as they carried their boat to the boat
house, said: .
Coach Ward Satisfied.
"I am perfectly satisfied with their work
and their condition. In every respect the
boys are as good as ever they were in
their lives. I have great hopes. Of course
It is always difficult to predict the result
of any boat race, but all I ask is. that all
the men be in as good condition Friday as *
they are to-night."
Coach Ward is undisturbed by the fact
that during Leander's trial, over the full
course the latter made several seconds
better time than the Pennsylvanlans. '
"The conditions were entirely, different,"
said Ward, "and I am well satisfied with
the outlook."
The Pennsylvanians concluded - their-
city, as well as -the patrol wagons and
many other vehicles, were kept busy
answering calls. At the rate of about one
a minute the calls came in over the po-?
lice wires throughout the day. breaking
, all records of demands upon the ambu
lance service, and providing patients

city as they have never been before

"WASHINGTON, July 2.âThunder

hot spell late in the afternoon. The ther
mometer, which had reached almost a
hundred degrees at noon, fell steadily
throughout the afternoon and evening 1 , so
that at 9 o'clock to-night the record at

PITTSBURG. July 2.â Aside from
the faith that is being pinned to
J. Pierpont Morgan's probable
6tate of mind when he steps from
the Deutschland to-morrow, there
5s no sign that the Joint strike involving
most cf the mills of the United States
Steel Corporation will be avoided. The
strike that has begun was until to-day
practically no strike at all.
The men are not working for two rea
sons: First, many mills at this time shut
down anyway for repairs; second, the
men left work owing to tne failure of the
representatives of the union and of the
manufacturers to sign the scale, but no
itrike was ordered until notice was sent
out by President Shaffer to-night. The
expiration on June SO cf the scale which
has not been renewed was a signal for
work to bo abandoned and the men, like
a trained army, quit without the formal
ity of a notice and will remain idle until
the scale Is signed.
A far more serious phase Â¦will be devel
oped in two weeks. If at that time, when
the repairs are completed and the men
have had their rest, the scale be not
Fipried then will come the great conflict.

NEW YORK, July 2.â A tornado struck
the shores of the Hudson River. near Os
sining, N. Y., this afternoon, cutting a
path two miles or more long and several
hundred feet vride. All along its course
trees were uprooted, buildings unroofed
and windows blown In. No houses were
blown down as far as reported, neither
â¢wers there any fatalities as far as can
be learned.
The tornado embraced practically the
whole village, and the Sing, Sing Prison
was in the very center of' the storm's
path. There was great excitement and
much tamage. Almost every window on
the water side of the prison was blown
In, Â«jn<S the rain and yellow mud, scooped
up by the wind, was driven through the
prison in every- direction. '
The prisoners had just been locked in
their cells for the night when the. blast
hit the place. They set up an awful howl-
Ing and screaming. Their terror was in
tensified when a moment after the win
dows were blown in there was a ripping
and roaring sound caused by the wind
tearing off the roof of the administration
building. The roof of a shop, was also
torn away.
Through the village trees were torn up

The scene as the frightened inmates
rushed half-naked into the streets, utter
ing shrill cries and imprecations, beg

spread from the central structure to-, the
adjoining buildings the pandemonium in
creased.
Half-clad women, shrieking hysteri
cally, attempted to dash back into the
blazing buildings, crying out that some ot
their children or their kin were perish
ing in the flames, and it took the united
efforts of the police and the firemen to
ished in the flames.
At 3:30 it had been impossible to verify
these rumors of deaths, and it may be
possible that the women may have been
rescued by friends and found shelter in
seme of the nearby houses.
The burned tenements were situated on
the side of Telegraph Hill, and the flames
were therefore clearly visible throughout
the city, leading to the general impression
that the conflagration was greater than
it really was.
While the financial loss is not heavy,
the destruction of the chattels in the old
buildings is a serious loss to the poor
Italians inhabiting the place.
Two aged women are thought to have
perished in a fire that broke out in the
Latin quarter at 2:45 o'clock this morning,
destroying three tenement houses at H15
and 317 Valiejo rtreet and 3 Prescott
place, together with all the contents.
The three tenement houses were occu

ilies. The tenement at 317 Valiejo street
was a four-story structure, and was con
ducted by C. Demarti. who also con
ducted the houÂ«e at 3 Prescott place,
which was a three-story building. The
house at S15 VaJlejo street was a three
story tenement, conducted by M. Scheelin.
It was in the Scheelin building that the
farces were first discovered. How the
fire originated is not known, but as soon
as the flames were seen an alarm was
turned in. and this was quickly followed

sacrificing their lives.
The firemen got the fire under control
at 3:30 o'clock, though at that hour the
old buildings were still blazing fiercely.
Between seventy-five and eighty peoplo
were rendered homeless, losing all their
worldly effects.
There were many rumors of loss of life,
some placing the number of victims as
high as five, but closer inquiry brought
the number down to two. One of these
victims is supposed to be Mrs. * Taran
tinl, an aged cripple, who resided in the
tenement at 317 VaJlejo street. Several
persons stated that they saw her trying
to get out, but that she fell back into the
flames.

"The eastward movement of another
low pressure fir ea in the extreme West
renders it improbable that there will be
any long continued relief from the high
temperatures over districts now affected,
but it Is not probable they will reach the
previous extreme in the Atlantic States,
because of the . influence of a moderate
West Indian disturbance, which appears
to be moving northward over the Lesser
Antilles. H. E. WILLIAMS,
"The hot wave which has prevailed dur
ing the. ten or twelve d'ays over New Eng
land, the Mi'ldle Atlantic j States, the
lake region, the Ohio Villey and trie Cen
tral West and Northwest, continued dur
ing Tuesday, although temporary relief
was ifforded during the afternoon by
numerous thunder-storms in New England
and the Middle Atlantic States and at
Chicago and St. Lot'Is. . As yet this warm
wave has not equaled in duration those
of 1SS1 and 1900. except in New York City,
where during the present hot wave the
maximum temperatures have ranged
from 90 to 98 during the past seven days,
exceeding the greatest previous record by
two degrees. Neither have the extreme

character, will bring only partial relief
from the heat. The prediction oCrthe offi

the next forty-eight hours will show a

that they will still climb above the 90-de

WASHINGTON, July 2. â President

regarded the machinists' strike as practi

"Even if an order should be issued at
this time directing all men out to return
to work on the old basis," he said, "the
nine-hour day would be won.
"The movement has been attended with
every success and in many respects is the
most remarkable struggle on record.
There are now only 8000 men out and
agreements are being signed every day,
reducing this number. It has not been a
strike. It simply has been a cessation of
work. A strike, to the mind of the, pub

chinists have had none of these. It is
true, there have 'been one or two cases of
assault, but these are liable to occur at

clothes. He was about 5 feet 10 inches in.
height and weighed In the neighborhood
of 180 pounds. He had gray whiskers and

tried to get to St. Michael, but, like the
Centennial, had to abandon the attempt.

fortunate legal entanglements with hla
daughter, Mrs, Tom Lewla, concerning
the disposition of the late Mrs. l>uncan's
property and jewels, waa examined In th*
Township Court to-day on supplementary
proceedings. His daughter's attorneys
subjected the old man to a. rigid examina
tion aa to what sources of lncomÂ» ha had
beyond those derived from his late wife's
property. The colonel replied that hÂ» had
made several thousand dollars by the
correctness of his political prophecies of
the election in '92, having backed his be
liefs heavily. He addeE that his income
had been increased considerably by his
skill as a whist player.
Mrs. Lewis' attorneys asked Colonel
Duncan to irive the names of somÂ« of the
gentlemen from whom he had won at
whist. The KentucMan indignantly re
fused, protesting that snch action would
be unworthy of a Southern gentleman.
The court insisted that the colonel an
swer, but Colonel Duncan refused to take

SAX BERNARDINO. July 2.â News has
reached here of a fight that took place
early this morning on the Southern Pa
cific Railway at a watering station be
tween Indlo and Yuma. The participants
were the crew of an east-bound freight
train and three tramps. Shortly before
reaching the station the tramps were dis
covered by the head brakeman stealing a
ride. He requested them to get off at the
next stop. They did so. but when the
train started they again got aboard. The
train was stopped and upon being ordered
off again, the tramps drew knives and at
tacked the conductor. The latter drew
his revolver and nred. The bullet entered
the head of one of the tramps. The rest
of the train crew came to the conductor's
assistance and finally overcame the
tramps. The wounded man was placed
aboard a passenger train and taken to the
Sisters' Hospital in Los Angeles for treat
ment.

PHOENIX. Ariz., July 2.â Tod Carver.
alias Hilliard, one of the most notorious
outlaws operating In this Territory In re
cent years. Is behind prison bans. He was
captured by George E. Scarborough Jr.,
Ed Halverson and Pollard Pearson and
jailed in St. Johns, the county seat of
Apache County, on June 27, the news
reaching here to-day.
For months officers have been on the
trail of the bandit and his capture was
effected near Luna, N. Mcx., by a clever
scheme. Carver recently returned to
Arizona from Texas. The officers were
on the lookout for some time before they
found an opportunity to take him by sur
prise. They finally located his camp, and
during his absence from the rendezvous
secreted their horses elsewhere, and, slip
ping In, quietly took possession and hid
themselves.
Late in the evening- Carter and another
man came Into camp. When Scarborough
shouted "Up with your hands!" the
stranger obeyed, but Carver replied, "Not
for an officer." Scarborough repeated his
command and was about to open fire
when Carver's hands went up. The
stranger was given his liberty and the
officers escorted Carver to Luna Valley
and thence to St. Johns, where he is
eruarded by an extra force to prevent a
rescue by his friends.
Fifteen months agro Frank Lesuer and
Andrew A. Gibbons, two popular young
men. were murdered near St. Johns by a
band of outlaws, one of the leaders of
which was Carver. The identity of the
man is beyond question, and all that re
mains is to prove conclusively his connec
tion with that r>articular crime.
Since the wanton murder the Apache
County officers have sought contlnuously
for the outlaws and have followed notori
ous gangs- all over the West. Scarbor
ough is a son of George Scarborough, who
was killed a year or two ago In South
eastern Arizona and v.-ho was famous
throughout this region as a bandit
catcher. The son took up his work with
the rangers shortly after the killing of
his father and for a young officer has a
notable record for daring and .bravery.

SACRAMEXTO. July 2.â The Prince and
Princess Hatzfeldt are guests at' the Cap
ital Hotel. They will leave to-morrow
for the East. Joseph D. Redding, the San
Francisco attorney, will not go East with
them, but will remain In California. The
Prince explains this by saying, that Mr.
Redding Is a native Calif ornian and Is
naturally loth to leave the State.. Sac
ramento happens to be the scene of Mr.
Reddlng's happy childhood hours, and It
was supposed that he would put in much
6t his time looking up old primary school
chums and swapping yarns with them.
But while Mr. Redding under ordinary
circumstances is quite given to social
amenities and the exchange of reminis
cences, he did not indulge that amiable
weakness to any extent to-day. The only
person who seemed to awaken the confi
dence of the Hatzfeldts* counsel to-day
was Frank D. Ryan, a well known local
lawyer. The Prince and Mr. Redding had
Mr. Ryan at luncheon in their apartments
and the fact that the three were together
considerably during tÂ£e day gave rise to
the general impression that there was
"something doing" in the legal line.
The Prince was asked if any settlement
had been made with the legatees of the
Huntington will, and he declared that no
setlement had ever been suggested, much
less accomplished.
The Prince said that he might go to
Newport for the season " or return to
Europe, his course being governed Â¦ en
tirely byconditions when he reached New
York. E&cally the impression Is that
some form of a legal proceeding will
shortly be sprung by the Hatzfeldts and
that the visit of Redding and the con
ferences wijh local counsel bear out this
Idea.

SACRAMENTO, July 2.-A telegram re-
The Balaena is -a total wreck." She is
hanging to the rock .where She struck,
but is liable to slip off Into the water and
sink at any time. She struck on the port
side and crashad a hole fully twelve feet
In length In her hull. The waves during
the night of the wreck pounded her stern
to pieces. The wrecked whaler is a ves
sel of 600 tons burden.
In a very short, time the boats were
manned and the crew started for shore.
The sea was bo high that it was impos
sible ; for the boats to keep together, but
they all made the island eventually. .The
boat which contained Captain Cotte was
stove In as it struck the beach, but the
captain and all the men succeeded in get
ting beyond the reach of the waves. The
drenched and half frozen - crew remained
huddled about in groups during the re
mainder of the night. Several had their
hands and feet frozen. .
The Balaena was on a voyage to. the
Arctic. She was provisioned for thirty
months. The whaler left San Francisco
on April 4 and after battling with the
ice -for weeks had succeeded in working
through the worst of the floes. She was
headed to pass St. Lawrence Island when
the wreck occurred. Shortly after mid
night on the -first of May the wind rose
until It assumed the strength of a gale
and the whaler was driven to a point
twenty miles .west of Southeast Cape,
where she struck a rock. The captain im
mediately ordered the boats out. The
whaler seemed to have been hung on the
rock and although the waves "were pound
ing her terribly she did not founder. !
News of the wreck, -which occurred on
May 1, reached Nome on June 21, and the
whaler Alexander was immediately sent
to St. Lawrence Island to the relief of
the wrecked crew. . Captain Cotte, with
several of the crew, reached Nome in a
rowboat with "particulars of the loss of
his vessel and the terrible straits to which
starvation had reduced the crew.
SEATTLE, July 2.â The whaler Balaena
of San Francisco, belonging, to the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company, lies on St.

Board of Education met in the office of
the Superintendent of Public Instruction
this morning, with Samuel Black In the
chair and Messrs. Van Llew, Burk and
Daley present. Dr.- Wheeler and F. B.
Dressier appeared later.
Superintendent Kirk reported that Dr.
E. E. Brown had been granted leave of
absence from the State University for one
year, and F. B. Dressier had been ap
pointed at the head of the department of
pedagogy of that institution in the in
terim, and it was ordered that for one
year he take Dr. Brown's place on the
State Board of Education and upon the
committees of which Dr. Brown had been
a member.
At the afternoon session ten ballots
were taken on the adoption of a primary
United States history textbook for the
public schools, without a choice. Mr.
Burk of San Francisco protested against
the adoption of any history textbook
until that adopted at the April meeting
should have been given a year's trial. _He
proved a clever obstructionist' and carried
his point by blocking every attempt to
make a choice.
Dr. Dressier of the State University said
he had examined the courses of study of
forty counties and found that twelve had
already adopted Barnes' .primary history,
ten had adopted Eggleston's, seven Mont
gomery's and one Scudder's.
The board refused to appoint a commit
tee of teachers to examine and rfinort upon
the best textbook of primary and gram
mar grade geographies, but appointed - a
oommittee consisting of J. W. McCly
monds of Oakland, W. H. Baker of San

was taken. "'..

Mr. Davidson is a son of Peter Davidson,
a pioneer, who came to California in 1840._
He was among the first settlers of San".
Jose, having resided there when the town
consisted only of tents. In 1844 the elder
Davidson married a daughter of the Cas
tros and the two families were associated
In many ways. Peter A. Davidson, who
Is a man of San Francisco, re
tains many of the ancestral acres in this
county. He was a student at Santa Clara
College. â¢
The bride is the -daughter of early pio
neer settlers of San Francisco. She Is
graceful In manner and conversation and
beautiful of feature. She is a finished
musician and her social accomplishments
are many.
Rev. Father Leggio performed the wed
ding ceremony In the presence of only In
timate friends and relatives. Miss Louisa
Peralta was bridesmaid and little Edna
Pearl Vidy carried the bride's bouquet.
Walter A. Vidy was best man.
The large parlors of the Castro homo
were appropriately decorated In pink and
white. In the spacious dining room and
veranda the tracery of smllax and deli
cate tints wandered over the wedding
breakfast table.
The bride wore a gown of mode shade,

Suesser says that one night when his
sister was in church at Salinas one of the
Farleys sat behind her and put his hands
on - her shoulder. His action was sus
picious, and a person seated next to Far
ley, made him desist. Suesser claims that
Farley then told that person that he had
"a notion to kill' the girl right here.*'
The prisoner says that had he remained
in Salinas last night he .would surely have
been lynched. Thomas Farley told Keefe
after their arrival here that a mob had
been organized. Farley had served as a
deputy sheriff and; knew the jail thor
oughly, and Suepser declares Farley could
have' opened the combination door and let
the avensers in. .Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦
Suesser has not yet engaged- counsel,
but he says he will put up,a hard fight for
his life. Since he was previously brought
here to escape lynching, at the time of the
murder, Suesser has grown thin and lost
his braggadocio spirit. -
Suesser was se"en at the County Jail to
day and affirmed the story that Sheriff
Keefe had received Information that a
mob from Gonzales intended to lynch
him last night. He is not only afraid that
some of the Farleys may kill him, but
said that . a short time ago one of the
Farleys had â¢ made a threat against his
sister while/she was in church. He de
nounces Thomas Farley as a coward for
attacking him on a train when he was in
the custody of an officer and handcuffed.
Suesser says he asked Sheriff Keefe last
evening on. the train to loosen his hands
so he could defend himself, and he inti
mated he would have settled with Farley
then and there. ,

POUGHKEEPSIE, N. T.. July 2--The
varsity race between the six crews was
a most brilliant one. such a race as Cor
nell, Columbia and Wisconsin put up be
ing the greatest ever seen on any course.
When the crews neared the bridge at the
threermile mark these three crews were
having a most magnificent struggle. Their
shells were at times lapping one another
and this position was maintained until
the three crews entered into the last half
mile of the race. They were all rowing
a steady, strong stroke of about thirty
two and thirty-four and then Cornell
raised her stroke and made an elegant
spurt. Increasing her lead over Columbia
by a length. Columbia, also entered into
the spurt and again went after Cornell.
When the three leading crews were within
a few hundred yards of the nnlsn line tne
shells of Cornell and Columbia began to
draw toward each other, thus shutting
out the Wisconsin lane. The Badgers
still kept their steady speed and the nose
of their shell was gaining on the leaders
at all times. Gradually the shells of Co
lumbia and Cornell again began to part
and the Wisconsin crew then made a des
perate effort to push up. but the power
did not seem to be In the boat. Cornell's
cockswain then began to swerve his shell
toward the east shore and Columbia fol
lowed, leaving Wisconsin in their wash.
Cornell finished first, Columbia second.
Wisconsin third and Georgetown fourth.
All four of these crews broke the world's
record. Syracuse was almost a quarter of
a mile behind Georgetown, with Pennsyl
vania an eighth of a mile still further up
the course.

BOSTON. July 2. â By the hardest sort
of riding James F. Moran pulled himself
to the top of the score in the six-day race
at Charles River Park to-night. Score:
Moran, 135 miles; Champion, 133; Stinson,
130; Nelson, 127.
.The best match of the day was between
Fred Brown and Drummond ilacGavin.
the two University of California men.
Both players were in fine form and after
playing three close sets Brown finally won
out by steadiness. In all three sets Mac-
Gavin had a lead of 2-0 and 4-2, but his
opponent played a great game and won
out, the score being 7-5, 6-4, 8-6.
George Whitney was in poor form yes
terday; but disposed of Collier rather
handily. The score in Whitney's favor
was 6-2, 6-3. 6-L Had Collier put more
speed Into his strokes the result might
have been very different. Harry. Haight
and Cnet Smith played an extremely close
match, the score in the former's favor be
ing t-6. 6-S. 7-5. 6-L Smith had a good
lead in the first three sets but his op
ponent proved to be steadier ana more
experienced, which enabled him to win
Percy D. Kahn surprised everybody by
the clever game be put up. He defeated
Richard Erskine 6-2, 6-1, 3-6. 7-5.
- The first match in the preliminary round
was between Harry Dibblee and Charles
Kuehn. The latter, while suffering from
an attack of stage fright, lost the first
two sets 6-0. In the third set Kuehn was
more confident and won 6-3. The fourth
set fell to Dibblee 6-3. The complete
score in his favor, was 6-0, 6-0, 3-6, 6-3.
Ogden Hoffman, one of tie best men in
the second class several years ago, forced
R. N.. "Whitney to play his best game to
win. The score in the latter*s favor was
6-4, 7-5, 6-2. Merle Johnson beat John
Craig "of Woodland in a rather one-sided
contest. The score In favor of the former
W ?f was thought that after Brown had
disposed of MacGavin, handily, he would
have little trouble in beating Harry
Haight. but the latter, when once fairly
Ftarted, played a terrific game. Brown
won the first set, but in the second set
Haigbt commenced to show his real form.
This set also went to Brown 7-5. At this
stage of the game Haight, who was for
merly one of the best players on the coast,
g-ot down to Â¦work and took the next two
sets easily. In the last set Haight, who
Is much older than his opponent, appeared
to be worn out and the set went to Brown
6-0 The score in the latter's favor was
6-0. 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-0. " .
Carl Gardner, a novice, -who plays for
Ixiwell High School, also caused a genuine
surprise by almost beating Alex Stewart
of Oakland. The latter is an experienced
player, but his younger opponent made
him put his best foot forward to win.
This was the closest match of the day, tRe
score in Stewart's favor being 6-3, <-5, 4-6,
3-6 9-7.
In his match with Dibblee. Kahn with
drew when the score was two sets to one
ntrainst him. Jack Hoffman and Grant
Smith each won a match by default.
The matches to be played to-morrow are
as follows: Johnson vs. J. Hoffman, G.
Whitney vs. Dibblee, Brown vs-.R. Whtt
nev and Stewart vs. Grant Smith. This
will probably bring Johnson and G. F.
Whitney together In one-half of the semi
finals and R. N. Whitney and Grant Smith
In the other.
The first Â¦ singles tournament for the
championship of California begran yester
day on the courts of the Hotel Rafael at
San Rafael. A slight breeze blowing
throughout the day diminished the heat
somewhat and the players were less dis
tressed after their matches than usual.
A crowd well above the average for the
first day was on hand and witnessed some
very good matches in the preliminary and
first rounds. Of the twenty men entered,
eighteen were on hand when play was
called. .
The winners In the first two rounds
were Merle Johnson, John Hoffman,
George Whitney. Harrison Dibblee, . Fred
Brown. R. N. Whitney. Alex Stewart and
Grant Smith.

death. Â¦ Â¦ ; . '
' Scott was . no common dog. He was a
life-saver; and his death was due to his
zeal in that direction. The dog was a
handsome collie, and for several ' years
had been the companion of Dan Saph, a
fisherman at Thirty-third street and Lake
Shore. He had rescued many small boys
from death in the lake, during his life.
Tommy Ackerspn, 10 years of age,
sought relief to-day from the heat by
plunging in the lake. Scott saw the little
fellow out beyond his depth. Jumping
from the pier that projects into the water
at that point he seized the bather by the
leg and dragged him to shore. The boy
returned to his home and Informed his
parents that a dog had bitten him and' Mrs.
Ackerson made complaint to the Stanton

to kill the animal, the police not recog
nizing the hero, of many reports in the

SAN JOSE. July 2.â The system of elec

that a syndicate of capitalists, headed by
George T. Dunlap of Gilroy, has promised
this county assumed a more definite shape
to-day at. a hearing before the Board .of
Supervisors upon the question of offering
the franchises for sale. The entire day
was taken up in discussion. All sections
of. the county are to be reached, the'ag
gregate mileage of the system being above
100.
The original petition had seven roads
in one franchise. This has been changed
and the roads divided into four franchises.
The first Is for a road from San Jose to.
Gllroy, with separate -lines to Pacheeo
Pass and Sargenta; the second from San
Jose to Alviso. by way of Santa Clara;
another line will reach Los Gatos by way
of Campbell, and the fourth is from Santa
Clara along the San Francisco road to San
Mateo County. ' â¢ â¢
The roads are to be built along the side
of the county roads. Work must com
mence In nine months and be completed
within two years.
Resolutions were passed by the Super
visors this afternoon directing the clerk
to advertise the Gilroy and Alviso. fran
chises for sale. . The others will be taken
up to-morrow and passed, i
Dunlap : still refuses to divulge who his
backers are, but as long as good faith is
shown by the promoters there will be no
opposition to the granting of the fran
chises. He declares there is plenty - of
money back of the . project, and that if
given an opportunity San Jose ; will soon
be the center of an electric railway sys
tem that will have no equal on the coast.

to the large crowd of passengers it was
after 5 p. m. before the quarantine officer

As was surmised, the Zealandia was the
cause of the Sierra being behind time.
The former vessel left Honolulu at 4 p. m.

At 9 p. m. two pipes in the starboard
boiler began to leak and Captain Dowdell
decided to put back. When the Sierra

Wholesome Advice
For People Whose Stomachs Are
Weak and Digestion Poop.
Dr. Hsrlandson, whose opinion in dis-
eases is worthy of attention, says when a
nan or woman comes to me complaining
cf indigestion, loss of appetite, sour stom-
ach, belching, sour watery rising, head-
aches, sleeplessness, lack of ambition and
a general run down nervous condition I
H-3viÂ£e them to take after each meal one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, al-
lowing the tablet to dissolve in the mouth,
and thus mingle with the food eaten. The
result is that the food is speedily digested
before it has time to sour and ferment.
These tablets will digest the food any-
way, whether the stomach wants to or
not. because they contain harmless di-
gestive principles, vegetable essences,
pepsin and Golden Seal, which supply
just what the weak stomach lacks.
I have advised the tablets with great
success, both in curing indigestion and to,
build up the tissues, increasing flesh in
thin, nervous patients, whose real trouble
was dyspepsia, and as soon as the stom-
ach was put to rights they did not know
what sickness was.
A fifty cent package of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets can be bought at any drug
store, and as they are not a secret patent
medicine, they can be used as often as
desired, with full assurance that they
contain nothing harmful in the slightest
degree; on the contrary, any one whose
stomach is at all deranpred will find great
benefit from the use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets. They will cure any form of
stomach weakness or disease except can-
cer of the stomach.

It is conceded that the British are doing in South
Africa just about what Weyler did in Cuba, but as the
affair is not within our sphere of influence we have no
kick to make-
An English editor says that the British merchant
is the easiest man on earth to swindle. This gives
us no particular reason, however, to cease watching
our innocent British competitors.
Such climatic conditions are bound to handicap the
East in competition with California should this State
ever have sufficient fuel and manufacturing equip-
Among the industrial effects of the heat have been
the closing of most of the big mills in Pittsburg and
elsewhere. It is reported from Philadelphia that in
Monday, forenoon . the number of prostrations at
Cramp's shipyard was so large that at noon work was
stopped and all the men employed were relieved trom
"duty.
Of course weather, of that kind is of exceptional
severity, but every summer finds the Eastern people
sweltering with heat and well nigh incapacitated for
hard work. While the Californian can work with
vigor at all seasons of the year the Easterner is com
pelled both in midsummer and in midwinter to relax
his efforts. It is possible that from^that enforced rest
he derives something of benefit, but subjection to
such humid heat as that which for several days has
been inflicted upon the East can hardly be perma
nently beneficial even in an indirect way. The Cali
fornian going about his work or his summer pleasures
with full vigor of body and mind is sure to be much
better off in every respect than the panting dweller in
the fields or in the cities where men fall prostrate and
horses drop dead from the slightest exertion.
It appears that in the crowded districts of the large
cities on the Atlantic seaboard and in the Mississippi
Valley the unfortunate people are'sweltering in some
thing like a furnace that does not cool off even at
night. From their crowded tenements they pour
forth to the parks, but find little relief even there.
Thus the New York dispatches announce that all the
grass plats in Bryant Park and Battery Park are used
as beds, that an army of men have been sleeping on
the sands at Coney Island, and on Monday the re
port says: "More than 100 men appeared at the
Manhattan end of the bridge carrying blankets and
pillows, and by midnight at least 15,000 persons were
asleep on the beach and hundreds more were coming."
SJJMMER in the Eastern States this year has be
come altogether too severe to be treated as a
jest by even the most incorrigible jokers. It
has gone beyond the point where it could be met by
sighing for a lodge in a garden of icebergs. â¢ Day
after /day the reports bring stories of men, women
and children killed or prostrated in such numbers as
to prove that the heated spell has attained the evil
rank of an actual calamity. When on a single day
and in a single city there occur fifty-eight fatal sun
strokes and, eighty-seven cases of prostration on the
streets, it is evident that a condition prevails which is
almost as destructive as plague or war.
THE EASTERN SUMMER.
Herbert Spencer has shaken off the feebleness of
old age long enough to write a letter protesting
against the war in South Africa and saying: "What
ever fosters militarism makes for barbarism; what
ever fosters peace makes for civilization." The truth
of his words is demonstrated by what is going on in
the Transvaal, but they are little likely to be heeded.
A great deal of this well ordered conduct on the
part of white and black alike is doubtless due to the
thoroughness of the military training they have re
ceived in the army. They went away from their
homes as young recruits, but they return seasoned
and disciplined soldiers. - They carry with them back
to civil life a sense of the responsibilities they ac
quired in the army. They have learned to withstand
temptation, to believe that order is better than dis
order, and to take pride in conducting themselves
in such a w2y as to command respect When, how
ever, all that has been done by discipline is conceded,
there remains much in the . conduct of these thou
Â«ands of young men that must be due to the posses
sion of a native good sense and an inherent self
respect They do not intend to discredit an honor
able career in the ranks by a -week or more of dissi
pation. They intend to, save their money .and their
honors and to carry them undiminished to their
homes, where they will be received as men of whom
the whole community is proud.
Their conduct has not been that of a mere ordinary
absence of turbulence or lawlessness. It has been so
exemplary as to have attracted attention and won gen
eral commendation. When it was known that thou
sands of soldiers were to be paid off it was expected
that the streets in the neighborhood of the tenderloin
would be crowded at night by soldiers in various
stages of intoxication, that the late street cars would
be thronged with them, and that their disorderly con
duct would be a nuisance and annoyance. Had such
things occurred they would have been forgiven on the
old pleas of youth, of liberty and of the natural ex
uberance of men just returned to their native land
after years of absence. However, nothing of the kind
has taken place. The men in uniform have been
everywhere visible upon the streets, but they have
shown themselves as quiet, as courteous and as or
derly as h the restraints of military discipline were
still upon them.
" In a particular measure the colored volunteers have
commanded respect and admiration. That may have
been due to the fact that the public did not expect so
much from them as from the white troops; but, what
ever may have been the cause, the men of the colored
regiments have been especially noted for meritorious
behavior. Their politeness and courtesy shown to
ladies in the cars and elsewhere and their general
good conduct have attested not only their respect for
the rights of others, but the high standards of con
duct they have adopted for themselves.
OUR returning volunteers who after long ser
vice in the Philippines have been paid off at the
Presidio and are now making their way back
to their homes and to civil life have shown in this city
soldierly qualities and a self-respecting manhood not
less honorable than any called for while with the flag
at the front These thousands of young men, freed
from the discipline of the army, turned loose in a
large city far from the homes of many of them, and
with their pockets full of money, have conducted
themselves with a degree of decorum that has won for
them the praise of every one whose praise is worth
having.
MEN WE ARE PROUD OF.
Of course it is said that, as personal must always
pay tribute to real property, the latter will get its
return in the increase of such tribute with the in
crease of untaxed personalty. But, as personalty is
not likely to increase beyond the use that it has, and
as under the present system there appears to be per
sonalty enough to go round and serve the purposes
of society, we are inclined to doubt that any increase
will recoup the realty owner.
Now while an argument may be made for exemp
tion of the personalty of a manufacturing establish
ment as a bounty to secure its location, it will be
somewhat difficult to convince realty owners that they
must pay all the taxes, and that Mr. Carnegie should
pay none. He, no doubt, like his brother millionaire,
Mayor Johnson of Cleveland, would see much merit
in such exemption, but the costliest functions of gov
ernment are those that protect personal property. A
large percentage of all city taxation is to maintain
Police and Fire departments to protect personal prop
erty against thieves and fire. But realty can be
neither burned nor stolen.
Mr. Purdy is evidently a single taxer, for in advo
cating local option he advises the total exemption of
moneys, credits and personalty. He uses Carnegie's
case as an illustration. He says: "Mr. Carnegie holds
three hundred millions in bonds. In the present state
of our New York law, if he retain his residence in
the city of New York, he will be liable to pay a tax
of seven and a half million dollars a year. â¢ In Pitts
burg he would pay one million two hundred thousand.
In Connecticut it would cost him the same. In De
troit it would cost him two millions. But he can have
his legal residence in Idaho, the only State in the
Union that has the sense not to tax credits at all,
and pay not one dollar of tax on his evidences of
debt."
The New York Chamber of Commerce has rec
ommended a plan that has the merit of simplicity for
raisins State taxes. The amount to be' raised for State
purposes is levied on the counties in proportion to the
amount they raise for local purposes. This does
away with State equalization entirely and tends to
economy in local taxation. If a county be 'extrava
gant and raise a large revenue for lavish expenditure,
it must pay State taxes in proportion to its own
income. In fact, it is- a sort of income tax.
Local option in taxation will finally disappear in
practice. That is to say, the fact of county and State
tax being paid on the local assessment will finally
compel the same system throughout the whole State.
Mr. Purdy, secretary of the Tax Reform Associa
tion, tells of an instance in New York in which the
Assessors used some local option. The town of Vol
ney had three Assessors, and they divided the work
so that one assessed the property in the large village
of Fulton, and the others took the town outside.
These increased the assessment outside from its for
mer figure of $25,000 to over $400,000, most of the in
crease being on the cattle, horses, hogs, sheep and
implements of the farmers. The Assessor of the vil
lage made no raise on personal property. When the
Board of Supervisors of the county met as a Board
of Equalization it -found that no other town had fol
lowed the example of this one, and that it had no
authority to equalize personal assessments, so that
town had to bear its burden of increase in county and
State tax; but the Assessors learned something, for
the next year the assessment fell back to $25,000.
In its practical operation local option taxation will
develop difficulties that must be, as far as possible,
foreseen and provided for. Every State has a system
of equalization of assessments. The local Assessor
makes the assessment, but the valuation fixed by him
must pay the State tax, as well as the local tax, and so
there is an effort made to equalize the assessment that
one county may not pay an undue share of the State
tax. ; v ; ,-* _
COLORADO has before it a constitutional
â¢ amendment providing for local option taxa
tion. This amendment was urged especially
by the single taxers, but was backed by ihe large cap
italized interests of the State.'

It is certain: the bosses of each party will: have their
gangs registered and that they will make a fight to
carry the primaries under the new law. Good citizens
must -be .vigilant and resolute in, opposing . them.
Those, therefore, who- propose to leave town should
register" before they go, in order to make sure of
their right to vote when the election takes place.'
At the present time business is dull and there is no
rush at the registration office. It can hardly be a mat
ter of difficulty for any citizen to find time to have his
name registered so as to make sure of his right to
vote at the approaching primaries, but what can be
done so easily now may be troublesome, later on.
When the citizen returns from his holiday he will find
a good deal of back work claiming his attention, and
when "once absorbed in it he may forget all about his
political duties until too late. The safe way, then, is
for every citizen to register at once. ;';"
The issue is one bi great importance to every citi
zen, no matter to what political party he belongs. ' It
has been pointed out again and again by the ablest
students. of our political system that the defectiveness
and frequent corruption in .American municipalities
have been due mainly to the fact that so large a pro
portion of thebusiness men of the community neg
lect their political duties. In times past that neglect
in San Francisco has been because of the boss domi
nation of the primaries, 'but now we, have a primary
election law which gives every citizen an opportunity
to have a voice in the control of his party. No ex
cuse remains, therefore, for any neglect of political
duty. There should be a full vote of the strength of
each of the two great parties at the primaries,
and in order that such vote -may be given there must
be a. careful attention to registration.
A MONG the people who will leave the city about
j\ this time for their summer holidays there are
Â¦*Â¦ *Â¦ doubtless a good many who have not regis
tered, but who intend to register when they return.
It would be well for all such citizens to change their
plans a little and register before they go.

There is little or nothing to be gained by raising
another sectional issue. The constitutionality of the
Southern suffrage acts can be safely left to the Su
preme Court. There is no. use reviving old antagon
isms between North and South. The Ohio' Republi
cans should remember Grant's platform, "Let us have
peace."
While this issue has much to commend it we be-,
lieve the sober judgment of the Republican party will
not sustain it. We have had sectional questions in
our politics for years, and out of them have come
strife and wars and still further strife. There must be
an end to that sort of thing at some time, for we
cannot go. on being sectional and divided forever.
This is as good a time to end.it as there will ever
be. The South has felt a new impulse of loyalty re
sulting from the war with Spain, and there is no
longer any suspicion in the North of the existence of
a disunion sentiment among the Southern people.
The negro in the South is fairly prosperous. He has
ample employment, and his children are provided
with schools and colleges. Moreover, there is among
the white people of the South a distinct line of cleav
age which promises to bring about the existence of
two parties there. That will mean the breaking down
of the Bourbon domination and the establishment
in the South of a party that will be as progressive in
politics as in business. .
Following the lead thus given the convention
adopted in its platform a plank which after reciting
the disfranchisement of the negroes in several States
says: "We therefore call upon our Senators and Rep
resentatives in Congress for such legislation asshall
secure the strict enforcement of constitutional meas
ures guaranteeing to every citizen the right of fran
chise, without distinction as to race, color, or previous
condition of servitude. And we demand that repre
sentation in Congress and in the Electoral College
shall be based on the actual voting population's pro
vided in the constitution, proportionate reduction
being made for any State in which the right of suf
frage is denied except for crime."
Senator Foraker in his addressat the opening of
the convention declared: "This is no time to show
indifference to the wrong the Democratic party is
committing to-day in the Southern States against the
black man, whom it is robbing of his suffrage under
the forms of constitutional amendments and legal en
actments that are in violation of the constitution of
the United States. This is worse, if possible, than
the inhuman lynchings of which we read almost daily,
because it is without provocation, and is a blow aimed
both at a class and the government of a nation. Con
stituted authority must find a way to suppress these
wrongs, or the Government will deserve to lose the
support of a race that has shed its blood for' our flag
in every war and upon almost every field where it has
waved."
OHIO Republicans have taken a step toward
making the South once more an issue in na
tional politics, and it is probable that under
the lead of Senator Foraker the State campaign this
fall will be largely directed to that end. .The issuers
that raised by the Southern States in virtually dis
franchising the negro, 1 and the demand of Ohio Re
publicans that the representation of the South in^Con
gress be proportionately diminished. â¢Â¦"'Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦ '
A NEW SECTIONALISM.
Senator, Hoar says it. would be a "most delightful
thing to be a United States Senator if onejwere not
obliged to attend the sessions of the Senate." The
phrase sounds witty, but after all any office would be
nice if one could have the salary and the honor with
out having to spend any time at the office.
The design of the merit medal Is a flve
polnted star in open work, encircled by
a laurel wreath and supported by a bar,
the whole backed by a red, white and blue
ribbon. On the face the five points of the
star bear this inscription: "United States
Navy in the War with Spain, 1898." A
"foul" anchor fills in the* center of the
star. The name of the recipient will bo
engraved on the back.

Indian campaign at all, as either block
ader or fighter, will get a medal of one
kind or the other.
ONLY A FEW DAYS MORE AND THE CALL'S SPLENDID
ATLAS WILL BE READY FOR ITS MANY SUBSCRIBERS
AS was announced in The Call's
"Washington dispatch at the' time.
. Secretary Long on June 24 adopted
designs for the two medals author
-. ized by Congress to commemorate
the achievements of the navy in the Span
ish-American war. One is to be known
as the "battle medal," and is intended for
all the men who participated in the West
Indian campaign. The other is. the merit
medal, intended for such men as Ilobson.
of Merrimac fame; Lieutenant Ward, Svho
went to Spain and obtained valuable in
formation about the enemy's navy; Victor
Blue, Buck and others/
The battle medal bears on the obverse
side the profile likeness of Rear Admiral
Sampson, with the inscription, "United
States Naval Campaign in the -West In
dies, 189&â William Thomas Sampson,
Commander, in Chief." On the reverse
side is a* scene on the deck of a warship
in action, the central figure of which is
"the man behind the gun." This is in
tended: to recognize the services of the
junior commissioned officers and the
jackles. Â¦'
It was Secretary Long's Idea to have the
man behind the gun a distinctive feature
of the battle scene. ' This scene shows a
typical American bluejacket stripped to
the waist sighting a rapid-fire gun. Be
hind him is a young officer pointing to the
target to be struck, while behind the offi
cer' is a marine with a belt full of car
tridges about his waist and a gun in his
hand, awaiting his time to go into action.
In the background Is the dim. outline of a
battleship. On the whole a spirited scene
of the gun deck of a warship Is portrayed.
The Naval Board of Awards, which rec
ommended the, designs to : the" Secretary,
sought to. dodge the Sampson-Schley con
troversy ' without . sacrificing glory for
Sampson by stating in its report to the
Secretary that Sampson's likeness was
placed on the medal because he Â¦was com
mander in chief of the .West Indian
squadron, just as Dewey's likeness was
placed on the Manila Bay medals, and,
further, that these medals are for all the
men "who , engaged in the West Indian
campaign, whether at Santiago or else
where.

There is another important factor in the problem.
All students of crime arid insanity have noted that

A. A. d'Ancona, chairman of -the Super

munication yesterday to the Board of
Health in which he takes exception to the
appointment of a successor to Dr. Suss
dorff as Superintendent of tne City and
County Hospital and calls attention to the
fact that the board has exceeded its ap
propriation for the. payment of certain
employes. D'Ancona says:
The appropriations of 112.480, for student
nurses, orderlies and ward tenders, and ?23 Â»*o
for other employes, have been - overdrawn by
|46O, and I would ask that the salaries paid to
these employes do not exceed the sums named
The plan whereby your board will give the ex
ecutive control to two officers â one to attend to
the business of the hospital and the other to
professional aiTalrs â Is In violation of the pro
visions of the charter, which say that the resi
dent physician shall give his whole time to the
duties of his office. .. ,
It seems to me that no officer should be ap

resident physician should be made the execu
tive of the hospital and should supervise the

The charge of burglary against Matthew
Collins, special policeman, was dismissed
by Police Judge Mogan yesterday morn
ing. Later the Judge ordered that the
case be again placed on the calendar, he
having been informed that misrepresenta
tions had been made to him The court
ordered that Collins, who was out on
bonds,, and the witnesses for the prosecu
tion be subpenaed to appear in court this
morning.
Collins was arrested on the charge of
entering the cigar warehouse of Rlnaldo
& Co. and stealing 3000 clgarsi which he
was alleged to have sold to Arthur Bird
sey, a saloon-keeper at 123 Front street.
Charles S. Bier, a member of the cigar
firm, swore to the complaint and engaged
Attorney Ach to specially prosecute. As
Collins had denied that he sold the cigars
to Birdsey, the last named engaged At
torney Riordan to look after his interests
during Collins' preliminary examination.
Ach Told Him There Was No Case.
When the case came up yesterday Bier
was called to the stand. He testified In
effect that he had been informed by At
torney Ach, who was not in court, that as
there had been no breakage in makingÂ«an
entrance to the store there was no case.
There were only three keys to the door
of the warehouse. He had one, the cashier
had one and the porter the third, therefore
Collins could not , have had a key. He
admitted that the cigars had been stolen
between the night of June 18 and the morn
ing of June 19, but he was not sure that
tho ones which Birdsey alleged he had
purchased from Collins belonged to his
firm.
Ex- Judge Ferral, who represented Col
lins, made a motion to dismiss the case
as there was no evidence against the de
fendant.
Attorney Riordan at this point said that
his client, Birdsey, was not in court. He
had been in attendance, but as Attorney
Ach had informed Riordan that there was
no evidence against Collins and he had
withdrawn from the case, Birdsey had
been told that he was not wanted. He
could be sent for If it was deemed neces
sary.
Birdsey Ready to Testify.
Bier again took the stand and said there
was no usÂ© sending for Birdsey, as he
could not testify to anything material.
.The Judge then gTanted the motion to
dismiss. Later he was notified of the
fact that Birdsey would testify that he
had purchased the cigars- from Collins
and he Immediately ordered the case put
back on the calendar. Detective Me-
Mahon was instructed to bring Collins
into court and subpena all the witnesses
to be present this morning. McMahon
found Collins and the Judge instructed
him to be in court at the time- arranged
"There is something peculiar in the
case." said the Judge, "and I want all the
witnesses to tell what they know In open
court. There is apparently no disposi
tion to prosecute the case and I want to
know the reason."
Judge Mogan Suspects
a Scheme to Free
Collins.
REVOKES ORDER
OF DISMISSAL
mar the success of the undertaking and
all interested predict that it will forever
redound to the glory of the League and
the people of California.
The following appeal for subscriptions
to the expense fund was issued yt&ter
day:
Appeal for Subscriptions.
The finance committee of the International
Epworth League Convention finds itself much
delayed In gathering funds for the coming of
the great convention and time presses so close
as to make the situation uncomfortable; our
visitors are to be with us in a few days.
The committee was ready to press its can
vass at the time the Presidential reception was
projected and the subscription undertaken for
its funds. There was nothing to do in the
premises but withdraw our plans and to wait
till this was over.
We have pressed the canvass since that date
and have in sight only some fourteen thousa'hd
dollars of the twenty-five thousand dollars re
rcquired.
The estimated amount required cannot be re
duced: the contracts covering nearly the whole
amount have already been made. We feel sat
isfied that this situation . needs only to be
brought to the attention of our citizens to have
prompt and generous response by them.
. At the time the convention was secured the
committee having the matter In charge pledged
twenty-live thousand dollars for the city to meet
these expenses. This pledge was made neces
sary by the fact that Los Angeles, then in com- ;
petition for the convention, through Its Cham
ber of Commerce, offered to guarantee twenty
five thousand dollars to meet estimated ex
penses of the gathering. We felt assured then
and are confident now that our citizens are
ready to fulfill this pledge.
The promised attendance on the convention
Is greater than anticipated. Definite reports of
travel indicate that the larg-est number of per
sons from the East ever in California at one
time will be here during the convention.
Asking the prompt and generous response of
our citizens, I am, THOMAS FILBEN.

At least two big quasi-public corpora
tions will be called upon this year to pay
Increased taxes on their franchises. The
assessment roll just submitted to the
Board of Supervisors bv Assessor Dodge
<iifc!oses the fact that the franchise of
the Pacific States Telephone and Tele

$1,500,000. whereas in the year preceding
the corporation paid taxes on the same
itf>m at a valuation of $380,673. This Is an
inoreasr of $T.19.227.
The Market Str^pt Railway Company
has had its iranchise assessment raised
from J12.535.3Tii. on which it paid taxes last
? far, to S13X72.1S5. this year's valuation
This Is an increase of over $1,000,000. The
franchise of the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company was reduced from
$1.?1 1.571 to $^06,770. due to shrinkage In the
value of up property and reduction in the

BEGINNING WORK
FOR CONVENTION
THE contract was awarded last
week for the erection of a new
parochial residence for the clergy
of St. Peter's Church, of which
Rev. Father Peter Casey is the
pastor. The parishioners have been busily
engaged in raising the necessary funds,
and sufficient money is now assured to
proceed with the building. The structure
Is to be built back of the present church
and will front on Florida street. It will
cost about $11,000. The plans prepared by
Shea & Shea, architects, show the Italian
AH about the headquarters is busy pre
paration. The heads of all the commit
tees report that plans are. complete and
will be executed in ample time for the
convention. Nothing has yet occurred to
It has been decided to spend $5000 on
deaorations. In addition to what -will be
done in that line by private individuals.
Gigantic Maltese crosses are to hang over
the streets all the way from the ferry
station to the Pavilion. Hundreds of Ep
worth League red and white banners are
being made to decorate the buildings in
which exercises are to be held. Uniforms
for the ushers and guides are also being
made. *
It is expected that many thousands of
the Leaguers will be in the city several
days before the convention, although the
railroads are planning to handle the bulk
of the traffic on -July 16 and 17.
Some of the delegates who have ar
ranged for a tour of the principal points
of the West are already on the way and
others are starting daily.
The Pavilion has not, however, the
capacity for containing all the people
who will wish to attend the meetings of
the convention, and exercises will take
place simultaneously In Metropolitan
Temple, the Alhambra Theater and sev
eral of the largest churches. Open air
meetings are to be held at noon on all
four days of the convention in the City
Hall Square and on Van Ness avenue. '
The work of preparing the meeting
places and decorations for the Epworth
League convention is now actually under
way and will continue uninterruptedly
Until July IS, the day on which the pre
liminary exercises will take place. It has
been discovered that considerably more
work will have to be done on the Me
chanics' Pavilion than was originally out
lined and it ha3 been found necessary to
employ two shifts of men, who will labor
night and day until the arrangements are
completed.
A great auditorium is to be built in the
center of the Pavilion, and all around the
sides booths for the exhibits of the uif
ferent counties and religious organizations
are to be constructed. There will also
be in the same building an emergency
hospital, telephone and telegraph con
veniences, an information bureau and a
branch postoffice exclusively for the use
of the visiting delegates.
â¢ Suits for divorce were filed yesterday by
Louise F. McDonald against John S. Mc-
Donald for cruelty, Harry L. Curzens
against Hattie A. Curzens for desertion
and HJalmer A. Erunell against Marie E.
Brunell for desertion.
Lizzie Kosher has been granted a di
vorce from Paul Kosher for desertion.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Renaissance style of architecture. Work
will be commenced to-morrow.
The facade of the proposed building is
marked strongly and beautifully by a
triple arched portico. The sides are em
phasized by pavilion breaks, which de
stroy the appearance of great length and
give grace and dignity to the design.
The first floor is to be devoted to a re
ception hall and offices for the clergy,
culinary and living apartments, while the
second floor provides each clergyman with
a separate study in addition to his bed
chamber. The reception room Is to bo
paneled in redwood, with the natural fln-
ish. The rest of the residence will be
noted for Its strict simplicity and con
venient arrangements. The house will be
heated with steam and wired for electric
lighting.
The plan is peculiar because of the shal
low depth of the lot necessitating the en
tire length of the house to form the
facade. The depth of the house will' be
35 feet and the width or frontage 92 feet.
The parishioners are 'enthusiastic over 'the
plan to build a suitable residence to re
place the present abode of the energetic
and self-sacrificing pastor and his able
assistants.

Union cards came down from restaurant
windows all 'day yesterday at .varying
hours. Some proprietors anticipated the
time, while others held the cards in sight
until the last minute. Some overstepped
the limit. A record of these is being kept,
agents of the Jobbing butchers having
been scattered around the city for that
purpose.
Those who were interested in the matter
were unable last night to give a definite
idea of the number of cards that were
taken down. The spokesman for the job
bing butchers said, "It does not matter
how many union cards came down to-day;
tfley will all be down In due time."
Secretary Rosenberg of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council, speaking for tho or
ganizations affiliated with that body and
in the presence of Business Agent Lane
of the Cooks' and Walters' Alliance, made
the following statement: <
Information has come to us that some of
the union restaurant cards hare been surren
dered under threats of the Jobbing and retail
ing butchers that meat would not be furnished
to restaurants displaying union cards. This
simply means that the Kmployers" Association
is enforcing the policy of withholding supplies
from union houses. Wherever possible we
shall meet that Issue by withholding men, or
where that is not advisable, withhold our pa
tronage. There is no question but that the
wholesale and Jobbing- butchers are at the
bottom of the present difficulty. The executive
committee will meet to-morrow night and then
when we have more detailed reports at hand
we shall strike back at the butchers . mainly
responsible for the interference. We are going
to convince some of the retailers that the
trades unionists, and for that matter the gen
eral public, is opposed to the methods of the
Employers' Association.
President vGoff of the San Francisco
Labor Council was before the Building
Trades Council at 915V6 Market street last
night and advocated the plan of issuing
a journal devoted to laboring Interests.
Goff made a gallant plea for the proposi
tion, but the sense of the meeting, taken
by a rising vote, was against the plan.
The following statement, presented by
W. E. French, representative of the Der
rickmen's. Engineers' and Structural Iron
Workers' Union, was adopted last night
and furnished the press over the seal of
the Building Trades Council:
It has been reported in public print that Guy
Lathrop, "lately of the Building Trades Coun
cil," but now secretary of the State Federa
tion of Labor, and a member of its " executive
council, did indorse a variety of measures re
cently passed on by that body.
As this report, like everything else emanat
ing from the same source, is more for the pur
pose of deceiving the public, and because It Is
wholly false as far as it concerns the Building
Trades Council, we deem it our duty to set the
matter right before the reading and thinking
public of S'an Francisco.
Guy Lathrop is not nor has he ever been a
member of the Building Trades Council any
more than the thousands of other men who
hold membership in any affiliating- union can
claim to be. He has not nor has he at any
time been a delegate to the council, and is not
likely to be in the future if his present In
dorsing proclivities and erratic tactics are not
changed. O. A. TVEITMOB, Secretary.
The Leather Workers have agreed to
assess themselves 5 per cent of their
weekly wages until further notice for the
benefit of the striking iron workers.
Barbers - Honor State Board.
I. Less, secretary of the local associa
tion of Journeymen .barbers, has been
elected delegate to the .meeting of the in
ternational association to be held at Sag-
Inaw, Mich., in the early days of October.
At present he is in Bakersfield, where he
is preparing to organize the barbers of
that town into a union. He will return,
and visit various cities in the San Joaquin
Valley, organizing unions wherever there
Is sufficient material.
The Board of State Barber Commission
ers announces that certificates will be
ready on Monday afternoon and will
be promptly distributed to those entitled
to them. They were the guests last night
of the Barbers' Protective Association,
Speeches were made by Calish, Fleming
and Drake, E. P. Roche and others. At
the conclusion of the meeting refresh
ments were served.
At the ball to be shortly given by the
several local barbers' organizations, the
retiring president of the Journeymen Bar
bers'. Union,- J. R. Bliely, will be presented
with a gold badge by the organization, in
recognition of his services. No date has
as yet been set for the affair, but it is
proposed to make it a grand occasion.
The date selected will probably be that on
which the State Board of Barber Commis
sionefs will be ready to conclude Its la
bors in this city.
The Shinglers' Union has elected the
following officers: President, "William
Joy; vice president, Fred Brooks; record
ing and corresponding secretary, William
Garvey; financial secretary, John Bald
win; treasurer, William Kurlbaum; ser
geant at arms, Fred Joy; auditing com
mittee â H. Robertson, E. Davis, J. Sulli
van; delegates to Building Trades Council
âWilliam Joy, Larry Smith, Fred Joy. An
entertainment and social tendered to the
retiring officers will be given at 1159 Mis
sion street on the evening of July 12.
m .
Bookbinders Have Wo Union Label.
Harry Gibb, president of the San Fran
cisco Typographical Union, yesterday said
that the bookbinders have no right to any
union label, not being affiliated with the
International Union of Bookbinders or
with the local Allied Printing . Trades
Council; the rules of these bodies forbid
ding the use of a label other than the Al
lied Printing Trades Council label. The
bookbinders nave been given thirty daysl
notice by the Labor Council, said Gibba,
to affiliate with the International Union,
otherwise to withdraw their delegates.
The effect of passing the resolution of
fered In tho Board of Supervisors to re
quire the bookbinders' label on all muni
cipal books would have been to restrict
all binding to bookbinders, shutting out
the printers and pressmen. The Interna
tional Printers, -Pressmen and Bookbind
ers are one association as allied printing:
trades and have. only one label, and the
bookbinders are not entitled to the special
label they claim.

Yearly Report Shows That
Private Institutions Have
From figrures at present being: compiled
In the office of the Superintendent of
Schools the fact was developed yesterday
that the average daily attendance in the
public schools for the fiscal year just end
ed shows a marked decrease compared
with that of the year 1S99-1900. Superin
tendent Webster states that notwith
standing the increase of 2613 in the num
ber of census children, as returned' by
Chief Census Marshal Elbert. the average
attendance has fallen off 2S3, although
according to the census returns the at
tendance should have been sensibly In
creased. The figures for 1S29-1900 were
25.004 and those for the last fiscal year
34,771.
Another Interesting fact In connection
with the report now being prepared is
that the parochial schools and private In
stitutions have had a slight Increase in
their attendance. While the law does n<n
require the calculation of the grand tot">l
In the attendance in private schools, each
oae has taught more pupils during the
last fiscal year than the year preceding.
Superintendent Webster ascribes as the
reason for the decrease in the attendance
in public schools and a corresponding in
crease in the private schools the high
classification Inaugurated by the Board of
Education. He says that the reason why
there are not at least 1500 pupils more in
average daily attendance is the fact
that some parents were unable to
find a class in which their children could
be enrolled. Other parents were opposed
to their children attending classes which
were overcrowded. As a consequence the
private schools reaped the benefit of the
lack of accommodations In the schools
maintained by the State.
Webster will shortly file a report with
the board, in which he will reiterate hlf
recommendation made last year that the
maximum enrollment in the grades front
the second to the eighth, both inclusK-e,
be fixed at fifty pupils, and in the first
grade the pupils enrolled shall not exceed
forty. Webster contends that even these
figures are too high, according to the best
educational thought of the country, but
the funds available will not permit of a
lower classification, as it would necessi
tate the employment of a number of ad
ditional teachers. The School Directors,
with the possible exception of Denman
p. re beginning to realize that the classifi
cation at present in force is too high and
after further consideration they may de
ride thjat the Superintendent's figures are
the correct ones and should be adopted.
Too High.

CLOSING,
The stock market to-day was as dull as
ditch water and what business there was in
the American department was compressed in
the first hour and a half. Â¦ The list was heavy
on American bank failures and the strike in
the steel trade, but the best authorities io not
regard the labor troubles as serious, knowing
that only twenty per cent of the steel em
ployes belong to the labor unions. Although
London was a seller, the quantity was small,
and New York turning a quiet buyer, the
whole 'lifit rallied on an average of half a
point to a full point, Atchiaon leading in tho
recovery. The close was at the top, but the
market was neglected.
Money on call was easy at l\i per cert", and
finally became, unlendable.

ICEW TORK, July 2.â Probably the all-em
bracing topic of the weather Is sufficient ex
planation of all that called for notice in to
day's stock market. The attendance at the
board fell to the smallest of the summer and
business fell to insignificant proportions. The
recording of transactions of "odd lots" or lots
of less than 100 shares was resumed for the first
time since business in exchange reached abnor
mal proportions after the election last fall. Quo
tations were made of bid and of asked prices
where no transaction could be effected. The move
ment of .prices in the few active stocks was also
barren of significance. London was Inclined to
take a pessimistic view or American affairs,
especially of the steel strike, and caused some
sympathetic effect at the opening here. But
prices did not fall as far as the London parity,
and there were dull rallies after the opening.
There is not entire freedom from apprehension
over the labor outlook in the Eteel trade: but
Wall streef has arrived at a conviction that in
its present phase the desire for a relaxation
from arduous work plays a large part In the
action of the men and that the crucial stage
in the controversy will not be 'definitely devel
oped until later in the year. The South had
light on the probable action of the United
States Steel, as their meeting was called for
the hour of closing of the exchange. The iso
lation at sea of J. P. Mcrgun caused a belief
that action in the many important projects in
which he is a force would await his presence
and advlcp. and emphasized the waiting dispo
sition of the market Yesterday's crop scare
rumors were partly offset by reports of this
morning of rains In the corn belt, but the con
tinued hot . wave and the Government weekly
report on cotton were rather depressing factors
in the market.
The failure of another small bank in Buffalo
created an unfavorable impression and was the
occasion of conjecture regarding the nature of
securities held for collateral by banks in gen
eral. The call money market was distinctly
easier than yesterday. Witn the day's business
below 200,000 shares and the prospect of con
tinued hot -weather unanimous approval was
given to a movement to require the governors
to reconsider their refusal to adjourn the ex
change over from July 3, at 3 p. m., to Monday,
July 8, at 10 p. m. The individual movements
of prices during the day do not call for special
comment.
The bond market shared in the dullness and
heaviness of the stock market. Total sales, par
value, n.585,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the call.

in some localities, which caused but
little damage, conditions have been favor
able for all crops. Harvesting is progressing
rapidly. The yield of wheat is fuliy as good
as expected, and the quality excellent. Hay Is
abundant and cf good quality. Hops are eaid
to be earlier than usual and looking well. The
hot weather toward the close of the week has

]y. The olive crop will be large. Citrus fruits
and grapes continue in good condition.
Coast and Bay Sections â High temperatures
have prevailed most cf the week except on the
northern t^ast, and grain and fruit have ma

l>rogresa is being made. The yield and quality
are fully up to expectations. The grain is
moftly being stored in the warehouses, very

vegetables are doir.j well.
The weekly report cf A. G. McAdle, section
director of the climate and crop section of the
Weather Eureau, says:
The Weather and Crops.
"The demand is the most noticeable feature
of the business for June, both in the redwood
and pine, spruce and fir circles. Receipts have
not been able to keep up with the call and
there is very little pine or redwood in San
Francisco or its nearby localities. Generally
business is greatly improved along all lines,
and the manufacturers, with the retailers, feel
thp.t a very prosperous season is ahead."
"The thirty days just closed have not seen
eny Important innovation and the status of
the trade circles of the coast, and especially
in this State, are felt to be improving with
the passing of each day and week. Prices
have advanced on redwood boards and pine
has been affected in a like proportionate man
ner. There is every reason to believe that
there will be further and more important rises
before the end of summer. The most notice
â¢able feature of the lumber trade hereabouts
is the scarcity of lcth. Orders for building
purposes have been so heavy and frequent that
the manufacturers and dealers have not been
able to ke*p up with the market demands.
Never before has San Francisco and its vicin
ity witnessed to much building with wood as

CHICAGO. July 2.â Wheat was weak early on
continued declines at Liverpool and on fine
harvesting weather and increasing movement.
There was a complete rally later, however, on
French news, Broomhall reportlng\ that the
crop in France had been injured by the heat
and storms, and private cables announced
France would require eighty to ninety million
bushels of Wheat , from abroad. It was mostly
a local market, with shorts adding to their
lines^ early and buying later on the reaction.
September opened Vsc lower to "c higher at
G5%<565?ic. Between these limits the price held
fairly steady. The low point was touched. at
65?gc. Toward the close a quick advance was
made to 66Hc and the close was firm, and %@
%c higher at 66@66%c.
There was a nervous, active market at the
opening In Corn, with conditions nearly the
reverse of those prevalent yesterday. Showers
over the Corn belt, with reports of no dam
age thus far to the growing grain by heat,
caused a weak opening and considerable long
Corn came out September opened %@MtC to
a shade over a cent lower than yesterday's
close and later the price dropped to 45Uc. " To
ward the close there was a sharp advance o"n
good, commission-house buying, together with
buying by outsiders and the market advanced
to 47%c. closing %@%c higher at 47c.
Oats were active and lower early, recovering
with other grains toward the dose.' Septem
ber closed %c higher 'at 27%c. . Â¦ : . ' '
Provisions were dull and heavy on large re
ceipts of hogs. September poric closed 22%c
lower, lard 7%c lower and ribs 5c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
The mining and oil exchanges adjourned yes
Â¦terday afternoon to next Monday morning.

cording to Bradstreet's weekly estimate,

Honey is freely offered but the demand is
slack. Nuts and Raisins are quiet and fea
tureless. Apricots are firm and in steady de
mand, and still higher prices are possible.
New Peaches and Apples are not yet mention
ed, but they will soon be. There is nothing
new in Prunes. It is now admitted that the
crop will be light, both here and in France,
and the trade say that were it not for the un
fortunate muddle in the market we would
probably have a brisk and good market this
fall. At present nobody ventures to foretell
the future one way or the -other. One thing
is tolerably certain â the i small and poor
Prunes which comprise the carry-over stock
will not be accepted by foreign buyers. .

Limes are still higher and getting scarce.
Lemons and Oranges are in ample supply and
unchanged.
Summer fruits continue to show the effects
of heat, being soft and sunburned. Prices, how
ever, are not materially changed, and have been
remarkably stationary for a week. Apricots in
bulk have a very wide range, say from $5Q15
per ton for small and scabby up to $20(925 for
good to choice large fruit. Figs maintain the
advance noted at the beginning of the week,
supplies being somewhat lighter, though there
is no scarcity. Melons and Grapes are not mak
ing much show as yet. There are plenty of
Apples, Plums and Peaches on the market, but
Pear3 are rather shy. Cherries are hardly seen
now. Â¦ . Berries continue cheap.

are too large for the poor midsummer demand.
Stocks of Butter are not as heavy as they
were, but the reduction is mainly due to the
liberal storing which has been going on, so In
reality the goods are still on the market Just
the came. Large quantities are arriving soft
and otherwise in poor condition, owing to the
recent hot spell.

' London Wool Sales.
LONDON, July 2.â The fourth series of wool
auction sales opened to-day with offerings of
13,042 bales. The selection was not good, cross
breds and medium Merinos predominating.
Competition was unsatisfactory and there was
considerable hesitation until holders met this
new demand by accepting 5 to 15 per cent below
the May average. Thereafter the bidding was
spirited and most of the offerings were sold.
American buyers secured a few good lines of
crossbreds. â¢..Â¦â¢Â¦

Hawaiian > Lawmakers
Declare Against the
Proposition.
HONOLULU, H. T., June 26.â The
House of Representatives yesterday
adopted and sent to the Senate a concur
rent resolution opposing the annexation of
Hawaii to Cairfornia. The resolution was
a result of recent newspaper discussions
of the advisability of joining the islands
to California, President David Starr Jor
dan of Stanford University having de
clared himself in favor of so doing.' The
resolution declared such action to be
"contrary to the rights of the citizens of
Hawaii."
It was stated by some, of the representa
tives that Circuit Judge Humphreys, who
is now in California, had gone there to
act in favor of the plan, and the Home
Rulers were quite worked up ' over the
proposition. They all voted in favor of
the resolution opposing such annexation.
The resolution, it is stated, will pass in
the Senate.
Â¦Acting Governor Cooper has received a
letter from Governor Dole, who Is on the
island of Hawaii, stating that he is much
improved in health as a result of hia
outing. The Governor will be away' from
Honolulu for about a month more, after
which he is expected to return and re
sume his office. Some of the Honolulu
and Hilo papers continue to hold to the
report that he has resigned, In spite pf his
denial.
United States Judge Bstee this morning
intimated that he would not admit to citi
zenship in the United States a native of
the island of Guam. The applicant was
a man named Ooomanche, who has been
a resident of Hawaii for many j years.
Judge Estee had several other cases be
fore him and did not decide the matter,
but, he intimated that it was his opinion
that the court could not grant citizenship
in such a case, the only Polynesians ad
mitted to citizenship being the Hawaiians
admitted by act of Congress. .
The Iwilei stockade has been closed by
order of Acting (jovernor Cooper. He
decided that the. place, which had been
running by consent of and under the pro
tection of the authorities, was conducted
in violation of the Edmunds act, and he
ordered the police to close it. Governor
Dole had allowed the place to remain as it
was for many months, in spite of a vig
orous fight against it; There is strong op
position to Cooper's action, and it â¢ is
thought by many that the breaking up of
the establishment will have a bad effect
morally. Members of the Legislature are
signing a protest against the"" action* of
the Acting Governor. " 'â¢
â¢ Treasurer Wright is preparing to en
force the new income tax law, which goes
into effect on the 1st of next month. It
imposes a tax of 2 per cent on all incomes
over $1000. the sum of $1000 being exempt.
The law is claimed by some to be uncon
stitutional, and it will probably soon be
tested in the courts.

YACHT COMET SAVES
CHTCTAiMAN FROM DEATH
A party aboard the yacht Comet saved a
Chinaman from death by .drowning in the
tapper bay" on Sunday afternoon. The
yacht, which was in charge of Captain
Frank Raymond, one of its owners, was
sailing along the Marin shore. When
about midway between San Quentin and
El Campd the Chinaman, who was in A
small skiff, passed along frantically cry r
ing for help- The bay was very choppy
and he was unable to make shore. The
small boat was rapidly filling with water
and in imminent danger of sinking.
| Raymond put his yacht about and suc
ceeded in. getting a line to the Chinaman
and he was soon on board, where 'he was
"dried out." His boat was in a water
logged condition, but it was towed along
by the yacht and finally beached on El
CaitiDO shore. --Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦â¢.,Â¦: Â¦: Â¦ *
The Chinaman was exhausted with his
efforts to beat against the tide and heavy
gale which prevailed, but he soon recov
ered. He said that two yachts passed
him while he was In a helpless condition.
Had he not been rescued by the Comet he
Â¦would have sunk with his boat. He said
he came from one of the ChinesÂ© camps
off Point Richmond. He was so grateful
for his rescue that he pressed his rescuers
to accept a. battered purse containing 05
cents. This was refused and the grate
ful Celestial was left at El Campo.
Among the pleasure-seekers on the
Comet who were instrumental in saving 1
a life were Frank Raymond. Frank Clin
ton. Mr. and Mrs. A, Raymond, Miss Net
tie Burton and John Behan and family.
Severe weather was encountered by the
yachts, of the Corinthian Club which
sailed to McNears Landing on a cruise.
The Surprise sprang a leak and the pumps
â¢were set to work. After hundreds >of gal
lons of water had been pumped out it was
necessary for the whole crew to set to
"bailing" to save the yacht from sinking.
The Harpoon with a party of ladies
aboard got the full force of the wind,
which blew at the rate. of sixty miles an
hour, and the pleasure-seekers ' Â¦ were
drenched w}th the salt water. All the
yachts were under close reef, and the
wonder -is that serious accidents were
avoided. .......

iespor.se to his request asking for a state
ment of the reasons that prompted his
Â£00 pupils to elect his course. A number
of students stated in their answer that
they wished to learn the Harvard method
of teaching English composition, as Pro
fessor Wendell is considered a grt-at
American authority on the subject.
In commencing Ms discourse Professor
Wendell said: "I really don't know that
there are any Harvard methods, but if
there are any I suppose this is the way."
With tills brief introduction he read some
of the essays, with a running comment
on them. He picked out the obvious faults
la their style and made more or less geod
natured fun out of the papers. "Themes
Â¦which are handed in to a teacher of com
position can be treated with just as much
freedom as if they were in print," said
the professor, as an excuse for his severe
comments upon the literary efforts of his
class. He characterized some of the
themes as "sloppy," others "nonsensical"'
and "worthless." He finally selected a
composition by a female student, which
he described as "the worst example of
Flop I have met yet." and closed the dis
cussion with a smile and the statement,
"That's the way I would criticize the
Harvard students."
The "Harvard method" illustrated In
Professor Wendell's . class this morning
has created considerable comment among
the students, many of whom are school
teachers. They consider the remarks of
the instructor in poor taste considering
the circumstances. It was not the criti
cism as much as the language used that
caused the comment in Berkeley, particu
larly his use of the word "fool" in com
menting; upon the work of one of his fe
male students. But Professor Wendell
protected himself by announcing at the
Vtpginning that he would use the Harvard
method of criticism. He has created a
little excitement in Berkeley with this
method.
Professor Wendell is considered the star
of the summer school at Berkeley. He
came here as a special attraction and has
over 200 students in his class, showing the
Importance of his course and his work.
Professor Wendell refused to discuss
the incident this evening. He said: "I
make it a point to keep my class work
private and not public property. I must
beg to be excused from saying anything
about the affair."

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
; 1118 , Broadway, i July 2.
The, Macdonough Theater will probably
be closed after the middle of this month
and the residents of 'Oakland will be de
prived of even the* small amount of the
atrical amusement that has been doled
out to themat the will of a San Fran
cisco management There is a..disagree
ment between the Macdonough >: estate
managers and the Gottlob-Marx Com
pany, which now holds the lease, as to the
amount of the rental, and between the
two sides the people of Oakland are get
ting no theatrical attractions for the S10,
000 bonus subscribed Â¦ by the city toward
the building of the theater.' .
The theater at present pays an annual
rental of . $4200.' The lessees want It . re
duced and the managers of the estate
want the rental increased to $5000 a year.
Each side refuses to modify its demands
and the San Francisco Theatrical Com
pany has ordered its resident agrerit to
preyare tp move. "
-Tne managers of the estate figure that
a theater in Oakland is essential to the
San Francisco syndicate and the San
Francisco syndicate figures that it con
trols all of the theatrical attractions that
come to this coast and the Macdonqugh
Theater cannot be run without its con
sent.
The management of the Macdonough
Theater for the last two years- has been
far from satisfactory to the people of'
Oakland, who feel that they paid to have
a theater built arid that they are entitled
to at least have it kept open. The pres
ent management has done little for Oak
land, in some instances even billing 1 the
town that attractions would not play in
4his city. Oakland is a city that will not
contribute to a cheap road show of the
farce comedy type, but is a liberal pa
tron of the legitimate. In drama. This is
proved by the door .receipts of such at
tractions as Sousa, ' Henry Miller, John
Drew and Hobson's Oliver Goldsmith.
These attractions have played to as big
houses in Oakland as.' in any city in 'which
they appeared.' But Oakland has been
surfeited with one night stand shows.
The town has in consequence acquired a
poor name In the theatrical world and the
theater has acquired a poorer name in
return. There has been little effort upon
the part of the management to cultivate
Oakland, and the condition into which
this yery charming little theater has
fallen Is the cause t>f much cqmrnent.

Serious Riots Take Place
in the City of
Mexico.
CITT OF MEXICO. July *2.-Th9 public
mind i$ much excited and the clergy are
filled with indignation over the results
of the students^ anti-clerical demonstra
tion yesterday. The students, to the num
mer of 300. held a public meeting near the
statue of Columbus, on El Paso and Shive
driveway. Stirring speeches were made,
showing the intense feeling of the young
r.ier and (denouncing the recent immorali
ties of the few priests, Â»who, it was
claimed, have been shielded and not pun
ished. A charge was made that former
Archbishop Labastida was a traitor to his
country, while the present Archbishop
Alarief showed no disposition to punish
recreant priests with that measure of se
verjty demanded by the nature of their
offenses.
A company of mounted gendarmes pre
served order, and the demonstration was
witnessed by Governor Coral of the fed
eral district and by Chief of Police Ville
gas.. The students, accompanied by a
great number of people' of different
classes, marched up San Francisco street
and on the way the police arrested three
men for insulting women while going to
mass.
By this time the crowd numbered fully
3000 people and made its way toward the
Church of Santo -Domingo, where the
Dominican fathers officiate. Part of the
crowd entered while the church was filled
with worshipers, mostly women, i Shouts
Â¦were raised of "Death to the priests!"
"Down with the clergy!" and the priests
left the altar and sought refuge in the
sacristy, with many of the worshipers.
Women cried and shrieked and the dis
turbance went no farther.
Another part of the crowd entered the
Church of Santa Carija, arriving during
12 o'clock mass. Windows were broken
and linages hurled down. The priests were
dispersed and the students made speeches
denouncing the clergy. There were heard
shouts for Father lcaza, who is accused
of many misdeeds.- .
The women present were terrified and
the police made several arrests, but
many of the prisoners were afterward re
leased. . The leaders among the students
had. counseled moderation and | against
making a disturbance, but the mob was
apparently bent on showing its feeling to
ward the clergy. In the" afternoon peo
ple assembled for prayer In the Cathedral
and other churches. . and to-day the
Catholic people are offering prayer for the
enemies of religion. -
Precautions have been taken to prevent
further trouble, but it is believed that if
several priests who are -publicly de
nounced in the press are not punished,
the young men may make an attempt to
invade the temples. Public opinion is di
vided as regards the demonstration made
by the students, but the liberals and non-
Catholics, consider that the clergy will
not be compelled to demand the expulsion
of priests who have been causing public
indignation to reach fever heat. â¢â¢" /
MOB WRECKS
THE CHURCHES
OAKLAND, July 2.â Cracksmen used
nitro-glycerine so effectively on the safe
in the Southern Pacific Company's rail
way station in San Leandro this morning
that the massive door was blown a dis
tance of ten feet. The robbers got 540 *or
their few minutes* work, but were forced
to leave behind them about $400 that was
locked up in a burglar-proof compartment
of the safe. They left little evidence be
hind them and the officers hardly hope
to effect their capture.'
The blast that shattered the safe wa3
set off at 1:10 o'clock this morning, the
concussion being so heavy that It stopped
the station clock at that hour. Several
people were awakened by the explosion,
but none of them connected it with rob
bers or safes. T. P. Knightly, assistant
agent at the station, heard the noise from
his home in the neighborhood, but wenc
to sleep again when he was satisfied that
the world was not coming to an end.
Mrs. C. "VV. HcLaughlin. the station
agent's wife, was awakened out of a
sound slumber by the noise, but was not
much alarmed.
That cracksmen had been around was
not discovered until 6:30 o'clock this morn
ing when Agent C. W. McLaughlin en
tered the station. As soon as he opened
the door he saw that the place was a
wreck. The door of the safe, weighing in
the neighborhood of 250 pounds, was lying
across the office floor, at least ten feet
away from the strong box. It was rest
ing party against the remains of a chair
tftat had been smashed to pieces. The
contents of all the small drawers of the.
safe, tickets, checks, books and papers,
were strewn about in all directions. Tha
money till, under the counter near tfca
ticket window, had been forced open ami
thrown on the floor. It contained no
money at the closing time last night.
" An examination of the safe showed that
â¢the robbers had drilled a quarter-inch
hole through the top of it into which had
been inserted a quantity of nltro-glycer
ine. . The explosive tore through the ce
ment filling and found the point of easiest
resistance to be the cast-iron flanges into
which the bolts of the outer door fitted.
The brittle cast-iron broke easily, freed
the bolts and allowed the door to be
thrown a distance.
The absence of the door left the rob
bers free to rifle the drawers of the in
terior.* In one of these they found $40 in
silver that had been left out for change
in the morning. A lot of checks ai:Â«l
thousands of tickets were left untouched,
though they were mutilated by the ex
plosion. No attempt was 'made upon the
steel box inside the safe, which contained
$400. . .Vâ Â¦":
All the robbers left behind them -was
an old brace they had used to do the drill
ing with and a small quantity of black
powder in a bottle. A fish plate used by
them as a lever to press upon the brace
was among; the debris.
Agent McLaughlin at once notified
Division Superintendent Agler of the oc
currence and Detective Maloney was sent
to San Leandro to make an investigation.
He said that it waa undoubtedly the work
of men experienced in safe-cracking. HÂ«
thinks he has a slender clew to the rob
bers in the brace and vial of powder h 3
carried away with him.

A CALIFORNIAN VISITS THE MONTEZUMA
MINES.
Concord, Cal.. June 27. 1301.
J. S. C. Thompson, Esq., General Manager
American Guaranty and Trust Company, San
San Francisco:
Dear Sirâ Having Just returned from a visit
to the Montezuma Mining Company's proper-
ties near Fairfax, Wash.. I desire to say that
I am more than pleased with what I saw. I
found everything humming at the coal camp,
fcawmill l getting out lumber, carpenters busy
at the flume, .miners extending the coal drift,
and everything progressing favorably. After
spending nearly a day examining the coal prop-
osition, and having satisfied myself that i'
the Montezuma had no copper at all. it had a
very profitable business in. its immense seams
of coal, I rode out to the Mowich camp (the
Tacoma mine, but I prefer to call It the Mo-
ivich, as being the more distinctive name).
The camp is in process of being enlarged, a.
second log- house being nearly finished, and
when ready the working force at this mine will,
I understand, be considerably increased. As it
Is, the v maln tunnel Is now In over 200 feet, sev-
eral cross sections have been made, and a sec-
ond tunnel started down at. the river level.
Every indication points to the fact that the
Montezuma has in this Mowich copper mine
a fund of almost inexhaustible wealth. You
can see that the mine Is a good -one, but how
good it remains to be proved. The rule is for
cooper to be richer and better the deeper you
go*' At least I saw enough to convince me that
In investing- in the Montezuma I had gotten
hold of a good thing. I am quite content to
await developments, and' am ready whenever
the funds are available to increase my holding
in the company. The shares would be cheap
at par.
â¢I had a most enjoyable trip, -was cordially
received by the officers of the company and
was only sorry I could not spar? the time to
stay longer and see rcore of the beautiful State
of Washington. Yours faithfully,
GEO.' R. WARD.
A Petaluma client increased his holdings by
4C0O shares because a friend of his Is "ac-
quainted with the properties and declares they
are all the company claims for them." Clients
resident in San Francisco and vicinity yester-
day added 30,000 shares to their holdings. The
Montezuma is tffe- only, company that has cop-
per, coal and coke "all under one roof." The
consensus of opinion arming . investigators is
that It offers the best opportunity for Invest-
ment before the people to-day. Address *

State Department Ignores Claim.
WASHINGTON. July 2.â The State De
partment has declined, to prosecute the
claim of Charles S. Allen, an 'American,
against - th*e Government of Mexico.- Al
len was arrested for working on a broken
water pipe in the streets of Ensenada
without the permit of the municipality.
The result of the judicial proceedings was
his final discharge by the Superior Court,
but he claimed damages for imprison
ment. The State- Department holds that
there has been no denial of justice and
if there had been malicious prosecution
the local tribunals afforded an ample
remedy. . . â¢

The - members cf the Journeymen
Butchers' Protective Association have
been deluding themselves with the belief
that Charles Ruisinger, their treasurer,
Â¦who disappeared a week ago, would re
turn and straighten out all discrepancies.
Now they have arrived at the conclusion
that â¢ Ruisinger, whom they Implicitly
trusted, has basely deceived them.
â¢ Yesterday afternoon four of the â¢ direc
Â¦ tors called upon Judge Conlan and the
Judge advised them to swear o.ut search
warrants to recover possession of gold
medals, books and .other documents and
money -which had been in Ruisinger' s pos
session. This property is supposed to be
cither in safe deposit vaults or in
Ruisinger's residence, which has been un
occupied since a week ago yesterday, Mrs.
Ruisinger having also disappeared. The
search warrants were procured, F. W.
Dar.z, one of the directors, swearinsr to
them. The gold medals alone are valued
at $200. Until they get possession of the
books the directors Â¦will be unable to dis
cover how much of the funds Ruisinger
has embezzled if any. .
Ruisinger was also treasurer of the
Journeymen Butchers' Union and It is be
lieved that he has embezzled at least $1300
cf the funds of the union.

that the railroad president of to-day does
not buy a dollar's worth of rolling stock,
but that the representatives who wish to
sell anything in this line to the railroads
go to Wall street and arrange their sales
with Harriman.

Headquarters.
The Republican Prinaary League Is far
In advance of all other organizations In
the work of awakening public Interest In
the cause of good municipal government.
Activity prevails at the headquarters of
the league, 930 Market street. Citizens
recognize the fact that the founders of the
league have no candidates to boom. The
â¢ main purpose is . to bring to the j primary
polls a large representation of Republican
voters. Bosses and place-hunters are tak
ing alarm because they perceive that an
awakening of citizens to a full sense of
public duty means the overthrow of boss
ism and the defeat of cliques formed to
further the interests of candidates.
The directors of the league are highly
gratified to receive personal assurance
from " leading citizens that the work al
ready accomplished is widely appreciated.
Yesterday was a . busy day at headquar
ters. In the afternoon the advisory com
mittee met to confer with the president
and board of directors of the league.
Among well known Republicans attending
were Vanderlynn Stow, ; I. J. Truman, J.
E. Doollttle, Marion Leventritt, A. Ger
berding, Emile Bauer, H. P. Sonntag,
George Lowenberg, G. â¢ H. Umbsen, I* H.
Bonestell, B. Arnhold, O. F. von Rhein,
E. W. Joy, Dr. W. F. McNutt and Thomas
R. Bannerman. Owing to absence from
the city or the necessity of keeping busi
ness engagements the following named
citizens abuld not be present at the hour
set for tie meeting, but they sent assur
ances of their support: I. W. Hellman Jr.,

At the joint conference of the directors
of the Primary League and the advisory
committee Thomas P. Woodward, presi
dent of the league, presided. The pur
poses of the organization were clearly set
forth by ' A. Ruef, chairman of the
league's campaign committee. He spoke
of the work already accomplished and
outlined the duties aiiead. The members
of the advisory committee listened with
keen interest to all that Mr. Ruef had to
say in regard to the purposes and princi
ples of the organization. At the conclu
sion of his statement H. P. Sonntag,
Marlon Leventritt, Emile Bauer, G. H.
Umbeen and others addressed the confer
ence. The brief speeches Inspired enthu
siasm.' Mr. Leventritt introduced these
resolutions, which were adopted with
hearty applause: :
Importance of Attending Primary.
- The advisory committee cordially Indorses
the purposes and objects of Â¦ the Republican
Primary League and commends the faithful
and honest work thus far carried on by ita
members. Â¦ . >Â¦
Recognizing that the primary elections are In
reality the fundamental and Important basis
of every project making for good government,
it is heartily to be hoped that all good citizens
of every party will do their utmost toward
calling out as large a vote aa possible at the
ensuing primary elections, which are now, by
force of a beneflclent â¢ law governing " primary
elections, surrounded by the same safeguards
and securities against frauds and violence as
are regular elections. .
It Is only by the apathy of the great body
of good citizens that the ever vigilant boss
cliques may rule and ruin our city govern
ment. "
As the day fixed by law for the next' primary
election, namely, August 13, 1901, has now on
the petition of the Republican Primary League,
been declared, a legal holiday, there Is no jus
tifying reason for the failure of any good citi
zen to do his share, large or small, in secur
ing a representative vote at said primary elec-
The primary election being held to select del
egates to a convention which will nominate a
Mayor, Board of Supervisors and all the mu
nicipal officers, is of prime importance to
every citizen who favors a strong, clean and
sound municipal administration.
The work of the Republican Primary League
in enlisting public Interest and in organizing
the forces of the Republican party for the es
tablishment- and maintenance of an honest,
firm and stable city government cannot be too
warmly praised.
Advisory Committee Organizes.
The advisory committee resolved to or
ganize and co-operate actively with the
league. A preliminary organization was
effected by the election of H. P. Sonntag
chairman. Vanderlynn Stow vice chair
man, Charles B.- Arnhold secretary and L
J. Truman treasurer. So much Interest
was manifested in the campaign for good
government that the members of the ad
visory committee attending resolved to
increase the committee from fifty mem
bers to one hundred, each committeeman
pledging to secure the co-operation of one
other active citizen. On account -01. the
magnitude of the advisory body .1^ was
decided to create : an executive commit
tee of eleven members to act in conjunc
tion with the league. It was further re
solved that the spacious headquarters of
the Republican Primary League, 930 Mar
ket street, should be the headquarters of
the advisory committee. '
An important conference of leading Re
publicans representing the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District. was held at the rooms
of the league yesterday. Indications of
harmony in the district were noted. The
voters are organizing to send a delegation
of good men to the municipal convention.

Mr. Robert Cummings left the city yes-r
terday.to return in six weeks, and he says
nothing.
Shaw wrote to Cummings and was successful
in getting a contract. He asked for $50 a week
for himself and the radiant creature - he - de
scribed as being with him, and -was told 'to Join
the company, as it came west,- at Chicago.
Cumm'nsa had no idea Mrs. Spies .was with
Shaw and did not learn this until he landed In
New York. When he did learn this fact he de,
termlned to terminate that Shaw contract right
there. . , #
When Shaw landed in Chicago, ready to start
to Salt Lake City with the company, he was
Jarred by receiving notice that he was not
wanted. He showed up at the depot with Mrs.
Spies, however, and | insisted- on going aboard
the train that was taking the company.
Then Mr. Cummings fell upon Mr. Shaw and
not only violently restrained him from enter
ing the car, but so altered and marred his linea
ments as to make Mr. Shaw practically unrec
ognizable.
And the plaint. of Mr. Shaw is : that all
this is woefully and cruelly untrue. .
"I have had trouble enough," Â¦ he said
last night. "All. I want now is to make a
living. For my own sake, and for the
lady's, I assure you most emphatically
that there is no truth in . the story, of
Mrs. Spies. I never had any trouble, fis
tic or otherwise, with Bob Cummings. He
is one of my best â¢ friends. He told me
only yesterday that he was glad he had
placed me here." , Â¦
But Mr. Shaw refused, positively, to say
that he had lost an engagement . because
of the Nemesis.. t ,':Â¦:
They were stranded at the -end of the
traditional two weeks. ; Let the Nemesis
go on with the story: r , ' ..
Shaw welcomed himself Into the Spies house
hold. He spent most of the time In Spies' of
fice, softly whispering to Mrs. Spies. *.*.;Â¦â¢
Last summer, when the companies for the road
v. ere being filled, Shaw succeeded j in Inducing
Mrs. Spies to Join her fortunes with his, and he
secured an engagement with the Krankie Car
penter Company, touring 1 New . England.
h The tale of the Nemesis Is thus told:
Shaw had been engaged by Robert Cum
mlngs, manager, as a general utility, man.
That* was: nearly or quite two years ago.
He lasted through the season,, and when
it closed Shaw was recommended by Mr.
Cummings to J. J. Spies, the well known
dramatic agent of New York, as a capa
ble man for general work. . - . .'. Â¦Â¦ a
' The Nemesis, which is another name for
an article from the New York ( Morning
Telegraph cf December 28/ 1900, goes on
with the story as follows: Â¦ Â¦ . .
The Nemesis comes all the way. from
New York in the form of a circular that
has been sent broadcast; apparently to
theatrical men all through the. country.
Mr. Shaw- himself â¢ comes from - Los" An
geles with Mrs. Shaw, where he has been
playing with the Ralph Cummlrigs Dra
matic Company. Mr. Shaw saya :that
company owed -him moneys when he left
and that he has need of it. . . -
Mr. Shaw himself dawned on the city
only a few days ago. He was engaged for
a part In a play, soon to be produced at
a popular place of amusement. Then the
Nemesis came. Mr. Shaw was disengaged.
He says, moreover, and with some bitter
ness of spirit, that the Nemesis is wrong
and that it has caused him. trouble before
this.
There is a Nemesis on the track of John'
Jay Shaw, actor. Mr. Shaw was booked
to rise above the dramatic horizon of San
Francisco, but the Nemesis may stop him.
