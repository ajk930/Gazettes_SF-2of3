recommendation, it Is stated,, is ".embar
rassing-" to "the" General, inasmu'ch'as such
action would-result in-his;own -promotion,
but he points out that the- present author
ized strength of the corps, 6062 men,
should entitle the commandant to the rank
of major general," as the army regula
tion* provide that the - appropriate \u25a0 com
mand for a major general Is r four' regl-'
ments and 4800 men; General 'Heywood
strongly recommends. that ;tbe:law pro

extended to the Marine Corps.-'.; .%\u25a0
The total number of casualties- in ; - the

the line were about sixteen or eighteen . Expo

As Is the case with the British defenses

TACOMA. Oct. 28.â Government experts
are superintending the construction of a
conning tower on one of the commanding 1
eminences of Fort Worden, on Point Wil
son, near Port Townsend, overlooking a
long stretch of the Straits of Juan de
Fuca. The tower is provided with a sys
tem of mirrors which reflect on a pre
pared chart the exact position of any ves
sel entering the straits. These waters are
divided on the charts into small squares,
the necessary elevation for the gunworlc
on any square being prepared in advance.
In the event of invasion the observer sim
ply communicates with the "man behind
the guns" the information that the inva
der is in a certain square. From this "in
formation the bombardment is at once
commenced* with great prospects for sink

The reported richness of ; the mineral

systematic effort to develop a., single

what' there may be in it. The Business

HELENA, Mont.. Oct. 23.â The business

of all mining towns who.have the'wel

every mining company that' claims Hel

tigated, and, if it is found to have any
"wildcat" characteristics. It will be un
sparingly condemned through-, the me
dium of the press, and unsuspicious in
vestors will be warned away. '
The necessity of this move ; hats been
made apparent from the fact that,
throughout the East, a large^-Jiumber of
these Irresponsible mushrooxn
have been -formed, without'/a* foundation
In fact for their extravagant claims of
fortunes that await those who. buy,' their
stock. The fact that .a decided interest
Is being taken in the 'mineral ' district

CORNING, Oct. 28.â The rirst heavy
rainstorm of the season visited this place
last night. About an inch of moisture
fell. This will gprout the summer fallow

damage will result. . The rain came just
when needed.
STOCKTON. Oct. 28.^rThere was quite
a heavy rainfall early this morning, but
the clouds have broken and to all appear
ances the storm is over, though there Is
a brisk wind from the west.- What little

The rain will be of great benefit to the
farming lands. In some sections of the
country, on the river islands, the bean
crop has not been thrashed. It is not
believed, however, that the storm just
enfied will "do any damage. The "north
wind will soon dry the crop of beans, so
that the threshers may be set to running
again. The fruit shipping season is about
ended, the bulk of \u25a0 the shipments to the
East consisting of apples, grapes and
pears. Thirty-two carloads were shipped
from Sacramento this morning.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 2S.â The- .rainfall
for the forty-eight hours ending at 7

at the bead of ihe valley, it amounted to
nearly six inches, and the downpour at

Mehomla with this object In view. \u25a0
Unfortunately, there. has not been col

announced that^it^nnot^add a cent to
that sum. * The negotiations." which will
be conducted will Include ;'a counter '/pro?
p"osal, : which will' be . made either: through
Mr. Eddy or through the' .missionaries,
who have been J vainly.; searching: ' for
traces of the captive. The. brigands , have
doubtless been apprised of the fact that
the friends of Miss Stone are unable to
raise "the sum of . $110,000, originally de
manded, and it is hoped they will now
accept less.
The exact whereabouts of the, band
which has possession of Miss Stone is
not*, known to the State Department. â¢\u25a0: It
ha3 the; general idea '.of', its location, but
the information is withheld . because* the
department does not wish the Turkish or
Bulgarian Government to dispatch troops
to the place. of refuge of the brigands,
with the result that e the â¢ latter would
probably flee to another hiding place and
be more chary of reopening negotiations.

W., "WASHINGTON, Oct. 28.â What will
be probably the most comprehensive pro
gramme ever submitted by the board of
naval officers to the Navy Department
for transmission' to Congress will be sub
mitted this week to Secretary Long of
the Board on Construction. The pro
gramme i urged to-day by the . members of
the board for adoption included: Four
first class battleships of 15,000 tons dis
placement," carrying the heaviest- arma
ment and protected by the thickest armor
possible on such displacement; four arm
ored cruisers of 14,000 tons displacement,
of high speed, carrying the heaviest arm
ament and the thickest armor compati
ble with displacement and speed; eight
een gunboats for. service in South Amer
ica and the Philippines of more than 1200
tons displacement; twelve gunboats of a
few hundred tons displacement each, for
service In the Philippines. In addition, it
is the purpose of the board to recommend
the construction of auxiliary ships, in
cluding colliers, training ships and an en
gineering repairing vessel. No torpedo
boats or submarine-boats have been sug
gested for incorporation in the pro
gramme, and it is-extremely doubtful if
any construction of these types will.be
considered. It is the intention of the;
board to hold another meeting on Wed
nesday, when there will be a renewal, of
the discussion relative to the character
istics of the programme to be submitted.
No naval officer has lost sight of the
action taken by Germany to expedite the
completion of its programme of ship con
struction, and there is reason to belleva
that this matter will enter into the con
sideration of the Board on Construction.
' In' conversation to-day with Represen
tative Fitzgerald, who represents the
Brooklyn Navy Yard district, and Repre
sentative Rupert of New York City, Pres
ident Roosevelt declined to make any rec
ommendations for the construction of tha
warships in navy yards as suggested by
the Brooklyn Congressman, on the ground
that such recommendation should prop
erly come through the Navy Department.
He said the subject had been discussed
with the Secretary of the Navy on sev
eral previous occasions and the latter has
invariably held that the construction of
new warships can be accomplished cheap
er and to better advantage to the Govern
ment at private shipyards. *>.:..> â¢
Some of the members of the board thin*
the programme considered to-day too ex
tensive, insisting that the shipbuilding ca
pacity of the country cannot accommo
date so many new vessels. Other mem
bers hold that as Congress adopted no
authorization of additional anmorclads at
the last session of Congress it is desira
ble to ask that a programme be adopted
which shall make provision for the ships
that should have been laid down during
the present year, as well \u25a0 as those which
in the usual course" would be provided for
in the law to be passed during the com
ing session.

The scene of the trouble is at or near

\u25a0was not the cause, however, of the mur

and eleven negroes . were killed and sev

Mixon talked with many men from the

reported that the blacks were equally ac

P. B. Carter arrived from Franklinton
a little after dark to-night, and said that
the situation was terrible and that more
trouble was feared. He said Joe Searlos
and Charles Elliott and another white
man, whose name he did not know, were

man, was wounded, .and that eleven ne

ing: alleged conversations 'with Admiral (then
captain) Evans on July 4 or 5. Â» . - - ...
"I did have a conversation with him,", re
plied the wltnees, - "but ' I do not remember
whether it was on the 4th or 5th. \u25a0 I would
eay of Captain Evans, as I have said of all the
others, I do not. believe .he would willingly
misstate. I think his recollection is at fault.
He did have, a conversation -with me in rela
tion to shooting the bow off one of the tor
pedo boats and the stern off another, and put
tup his helm to starboard and raking- one ship
and then aport and rakingr another. My recol
lection now is that preliminarily ha said - to
me, 'I>id you see Jack Philip start to run
away?' and I said, 'No,' that he was mistaken.
It was the -Brooklyn that made the turn, and
I asked him if he did not see the tactical ne
cessity for it." - . . . -'. .
Raynor then called , Admiral Sehley*s atten
tion to the testimony of Admiral Taylor, who,
as captain, commanded the battleship In
diana during the battle off Santiago, and Cap
tain Dawson, who commanded the marines en
that vessel, to the \u25a0 effect that the Brooklyn,
when she made the loop, went southward a
mile or a. mile and a halt.
"I think -they are - entirely \u25a0 and 1 absolutely
mistaken," replied the witness. "The Brook
lyn did not pass to the southward of the line
except the distance, perhaps, of her tactical
diameter, which surely was . not greater than
600 yards, and \u25a0 from that time she steered, a
course parallel to the Spaniards, and I- do not
think we were over. 2800 or 2400 yards at any
time from the Spanish -line. I say emphati
cally that the Brooklyn did not run eouth and
any statement to the contrary is a mistake."
The witness stated \u25a0 In reply to . a question
from - Raynor that when he started to the
westward. from Santiago he left the St. Paul
at the latter'placel " *
Admiral Schley then told of how Ms"
papers were boxed up by his secretary for
transmission to the department as the regula
tions require. He turned the box over, to
the department about February 6. He esti
mated that this box .contained all his papers
except the document he had turned over to
the court, namely, a copy of the No. 7 dis
patch
Conversations With Evans.
Reverting to May 31, the day of the recon
nolssajice. Raynor asked the witness if he rec
ollected any signal from the Massachusetts
to the squadron to not go in any closer.- \u25a0\u25a0
"I cannot recall that- signal at all," replied
Admiral Schley. "It . would have been, of
course, unnecessary In view of the fact that no
vessel could have left the line without per
mission from. the flag or comander in chief."
Previous to Admiral Schley taking the stand
Lieutenant Commander Harlow, was called to
correct his testimony. This occupied but a few
minutes, and Admiral Schley took the staad
about 11:10. Raynor's first question related \o
an Incident testified to by Lieutenant Grant of
a melee the ships- got Into on the way from
Cienfuegos to Santiago when they met a
sailing vessel. - _
Admiral Schley replied that he had an in
distinct recollection of the incident. He said
that whenever the squadron stopped it . was
always in conformity with signals previously
made. "If there was any mix-up, as testified
to," he said,' "it must have been the result of
the carelessness of the officer of the deck in
not carrying out the signals of the flagship." â¢
\u25a0WASHINGTON.. . Oct. . 28.â Soon after, the
Schley court of 'inquiry'' resumed its sitting at
11 o'clock to-day Admiral Schley took the
stand, continuing- his testimony. "When he lÂ«ft
the stand on Friday his examination ' in chief
had been almost concluded, and when he re
sumed to-day it was with the understanding
that after comparatively few questions . had
been asked by Raynor he would be placed in
the hands of Judge Advocate Lemly and
Hanna for cross-examination. Raynor' s ques
tions were again directed toward throwing
light upon disputed points in the controversy,
and most' of them concerned conversations
which' witnesses for the Navy Department had
reported as having had with the admiral.

T2XIiS OF HIS CRIMES
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2S.â Only one de
cision \ras rendered in the United States
Supreme Court to-day. It was the case of
Kred A. McMasters, administrator of F.
E. HcMasters, formerly a resident of the
State of Iowa. The case involved the
<jues;tions as to whether an insurance pol
icy soes into effect on the date of the ap
plication for it or when the policy is de
livered. In this instance the application
xras made on December 12, 1893, and' tha
policy, was delivered December 26. 1893,
when the premium was paid. Provision
â¢was made for grace of a month in the
matter of payment of the second policy.
McMasters died January 18, 1E95. six days
after the expiration of the- month of
grace, if it was to be computed from De
cember 12. or eigrht days before its ex
piration, computing it from the 26th of
December, the anniversary of the delivery
cf the premium. The Supreme Court de
cided that the grace began only after the
delivery of the premium, thus holding' the
policy to be good. The opinion of the Cir
cuit Court ol Appeals for the Eighth Cir
cuit was reversed.

time of - the arrival of the flying squadron off
Cienfuegos- and both sides finally settled on
fourteen hours instead 'of thirty-one. .
Lemly then reiterated his question on a basis
of fourteen hours. ; V
"The only reason I can give," said the wit
ness, '"is that she stood directly, across from
Key West to Havana; also that In shore the
current would not be as strong as It was
oft shored Then, probably, she may have
steamed out of . the current after she got
around.?-,- >
Raynor called attention to the fact that the
precept does not require any question cbnoern
ing the movements of the squadron from Key
West to Cienfuegos, but Captain Lemly and
Hanna contended .-that Inquiry in this line is
included in the precept's Instructions to in
vestigate Admiral Schley's conduct generally.
In presenting his objection Raynor spoke of
the "charges against Admiral Schley," but
Captain Lemly replied that there were no
"eharces." .. , . .
The; court retired to consider Ray nor* s sug
gestion and when its members had -returned
Admiral Dewey announced that the question
was in compliance with its decision of this
morning, coming between the of the 19th
.of: May, and the 1st of June. ~ _ . \u25a0
Captain Lemly then began a line of inquiry
to develop the fact concerning the alleged de
lays en route to Cienfuegos, beginning with
the interview between Admiral Schley and Cap
tain^Chester of the Cincinnati. In connection
with this incident Admiral Schley repeated that
he declined to take the Cincinnati alone be
cause he did not feel that he had a right to
take^a;. ship from where she had been placed
by the .commander In chief.
"When did you, first acquire the belief that
the Spanish fleet was at Cienfuegos?" asked
the Judee advocate. â¢ ;"-. â¢ . :
â¢\u25a0> "That question \u25a0 is difficult to answer, but I
think I became reasonably certain that the
fleet was there after hearing the gun firing on
the afternoon preceding my arrival and after
receiving the new s brought by the Adula from
Kingston." '.- â¢\u25a0--.. - ' \u25a0 ,.
"Waa there anything in dispatches No. 5 or
No. 7 to Indicate that the Spaniards were at
Cienfuesos?"
.'."There was not." .' s ' . '
'"Why did you not make an effort to ascer
tain whether the Spanish fleet was there?" > -
"I made a distinct effort on May 23 by allow
ing the Adula to. bo in." ;Â«,
"You regard that as the best effort that could
have beenmade?'^ \u25a0 . ' J. fi . \u25a0â¢Â«> , \u25a0 \u25a0 . <
"I do; inasmuch as she was to come out the
dar after." \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â--\u25a0 â CVÂ»i ,' "i'-- ' '
'"..- The? Witness was then questioned ' as to the
orders he received by the Hawk. , He remem
bered dispatch No. 8 distinctly.
"Whenyou received that 'order why aid you
not proceed to Santiago?" '/;.-â¢\u25a0 â¢Â»\u25a0
"Simply because the order'. was conditional.
When I became satisfied that the fleet was not
at Cienf uegos I was directed to proceed to
Santiago." - ' " ,
Schley's Letter to ; Sampson.
Captain Lemly called Admiral .Schley's at
tention to his letter to Admiral Sampson dated
off Cienfuegos. May*23, and raiding: -
"Sir: In reply to your letl&r. No. 8. I would
state ' that I am by no means satisfied that
the Spanish i squadron is not at Cienfuegos.
The large amount of smoke seen in the harbor
would Indicate the presence of a number of
vessels and under such circumstances It would
seem to .be extremely unwise to chase ud a
probability at â¢ Santiago ' reported by way of
Havana and no doubt as a ruse." |
. j "Does that contain all your reasons for not
proceeding when you received this last dis
patch from Admiral Sampson?"
"Yes. I may have had other reasons, but
I do not now recall them." :
'The Judge advocate asked the "witness as to
why he ' questioned the credibility of some of
the reports concerning 1 the location of the Span
ish fleet which came from Admiral Sampson.
He read^Admiral Schley's statement saying: " :
\u25a0 "We ought to be carefulhow we'receive in
formation from Havana." â¢
-He' wanted to know why the admiral was
shy- about taking: information from Havana
when i he would accept information brought by
the Adula from Kingston. ' .
"On account . of - the Implied doubt in the
mind of the commander in chief as shown
by the language of his dispatch."
Referring to Lieutenant Hood's memorandum
Admiral Schley said that for one thing he
should have been glad tff know \u25a0 that , Santiago
and Cienfuegos were mined. He did not think
,. "When,' at. 1:45 a. m., May 20, you sighted "a
man-of-war as shown by the Brooklyn's log,"
and cleared for action, what orders had been
issued In conformity with the provisions of the
regulations?" :- \u25a0 \ . : - \u25a0-\u25a0-.â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0;.. \u25a0-
*- "I should â¢ not \u25a0â think any : instructions f would
be necessary for a fleet meeting a single vessel
except to smash. her. up." '.'â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 t
â¢ Captain v : Lemlyâ Could \ you" tell absolutely
there \u25a0 was . only a single vessel, although ' you
sighted but one? : *Â»-
Captain Lemlyâ Do you think you. could sup
ply the captains with a plan of, battle without
writing them? â¢ \u25a0 -, - ' \u25a0':
Raynorâ I could not, but I know the admiral
could. - . . ' ' â¢-.' '
Continuing his examination, .Captain Lemly
asked: \u25a0_. ... \u25a0\u25a0, ".;\u25a0\u25a0;-\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0â¢- ; â¢: \ \u25a0- . . .
"Do you 'think, admiral, that you can sup
ply every captain. with a plan of battle and
do that at an oreil conference?" asked Captain
Lemly. -â¢'.-:.. . ' â¢..,/' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-. -
"I do not think that is absolutely necessary,"
replied the witness." "There are Instances where
battles have been \u25a0 fought without 'â doing that.
Any plan of battle that might be originated Is
subject to a change; I have never known a
battle that was' ever fought on the plan orig
inally chosen by the commander-in-chief .".-â¢: .
Raynorâ Do any of i the regulations use \u25a0 the
word, "written?" '- - . â¢ : -..
The next article was as follows: "Article
269 â He shall, if possible, before going into
action, communicate to the Juniors in command
his private signals and other information that
will materially assist them if called upon to
exercise command. 1 ' ... \u25a0 ; . ,-'..
"That I do not remember to have complied
with," said the witness. \u25a0 \ A- . \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0;
Captain Lemly -then read article 271, which
provides that the commander-in-chief shall. If
possible, before going into action, supply every
captain with a plan of battle, showing therein
the position each shall occupy. J , _ -
â¢ "Yes," replied . the witness, in reply to Cap
tain Lemiy's- question' if he>had complled^.wlth
that article. "I do - not understand that that
is necessarily written. I. think. that that order
Is sufficiently carried but when a commarraer
ln-chief decides to place his crews in the. order
of ' battle and inform each what he proposes to
&O." -" ":^' -::.-:\u25a0---.",.-- --- -;-, ....
Gives Oral Instructions.
"Yes," responded Admiral Schley. â¢
Captain Lemly read a number of articles of
the regulations, in each case asking the wit
ness If he had complied with the terma of the
paragraph. -The first paragraph was No. 267
and requires the commander-in-chief when pre
paring his fleet or squadron to meet the enemy
to communicate his general orders, instructions,
private signals and suoh other information as
will enable each so far as possible to under
stand his duty, when in action. and at all other
I. compiled with that." replied the
wltneis. /\u25a0--..
"How and in what manner?", asked Captain
Lemly. : ( ' - â¢ â¢' ' \,
"By Issuing general orders for thÂ« organiza
tion of the squadron, their .- instructions and
their private signals." .
The witness said he thought he could tell
why the department issued Its order regard
ing the protection of ships from land batter
ies, i when Captain Lemly objected. The court
decided that they did not .-care for this. The
â¢witness said he was on board the New York,
as well as he could' remember at that timt_.
from a half to three-quarters of an hour. Mr.
Hanna then read two dispatches from the de
partment, dated Washington, May 16, regarding
the reported presence of the SpanUh fleet near
Curacao. 'Captain Lemly asked the witness if
be was famllia r with these dispatches when he
had his conversation with Admiral Sampson.
"Admiral . Sampson merely ' mentioned them
to me," replied the witness. "I had not seen
them." '\u25a0 .<*'-\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0''â¢ ' ' ..'\u25a0.â¢ . ".." '
Captain Lemly then took up the question of
naval regulations and asked the witness if he
was familiar with them. * â¢ ;.
The witness said he had had no conversation
with Captain Chester about the methods of
blockade. The conversation dealt rather with
the habits and usages of the blockade.
"Did you learn from Captain CWester or Cap
tain McCalla that several gunboats were re
ported at Cienf uegoe?" '\u25a0 . \u25a0 . \u25a0'
"I heard that in Key West. It was the gen
eral report there," replied the witness.
"What official information and instructions
did you get at Key West from the Commander
in-chief?"- asked Captain Lemly. \u25a0
"His orders, of course, to proceed and ' the
conversation I have detailed with him." \u25a0 . '
Protection of Vessels.
"Did Captain Chester inform you that Cap
tain McCalla who came aboard the Cincinnati
had lately been at Cienfuegos in communication
with the insurgents?"
"No." i ., .- ' : . "
"Was it the duty of senior officers to call
for reports or the Juniors' duty to volunteer
themr
â¢Tne Junior officer Invariably volunteers such
information." *' . ,-
Admiral- Schley was asked why he did not
personally communicate with Captain McCalla
when he met the Marblehead on the way down.
He replied that he saw the auxiliary cruiser
coming down from the Marblehead to com
municate with htm. It was Captain McCalla' s
duty, if he possessed important information, to
communicate it. \u25a0\u25a0 â¢ â .
"We were ten or twelve miles" from the
height of land where the mouth of the harbor
of Cienfuegos was and we stopped until day
light. I . did not care to arrive there in tha
dark." . <
"Why, at 2:33 p. m. May ti, . according to
the log, did you slow to four and a half knots?"
- "I think it was. on account- cf the lire on
board the Scorpion." ' â¢ " ' ! . -â¢ ' I '\u25a0\u25a0
"Why did you stop at midnight, May ., 21,,
before your arrival at Cienf uegoe?" - . * .
'Admiral Schley said he and Admiral Samp
son talked of many things. It was rather a
long conference, and he reiterated that he
could not recall whether Captain Chadwick was
present all the time. The Judge advocate then
Jumped to the communication from i the Mar
blehead, conveyed to Schley. through the Eagle
while the flying squadron was on . its way to
Cienfuegos. The admiral said that . the mes
sage he received was that there was no news
of the Spanish fleet. The Judge advocate then
asked Admiral Schley if " he regarded . as ex
peditious the Journey of the squadron from
Key West to Cienfuegos in view of the in
struction to establish the blockade there with
as little delay as possible. â¢ .'.\u25a0*%'/

The Judge advocate asked about the speed
from Charleston to Key West to show that
the speed from Key West southward was not
so" great. He asked why at one stage the ad
miral had signaled to the Massachusetts that
if she could make ten knots It would-be suf-.
flcient. The admiral replied that after three
years it was pretty difficult to tell Just why
a particular, signal had been made when there
was nothing startling to fix it.
"Your speed was two knots less from Key
West to Cienf uegos than from Charleston to
Key West." '
"Apparently yes."

"Did Admiral Sampson exhibit- to you any
or all the instructions he had from the Navy
Department?" ' \u25a0 . . ' .." ' ; ' - .
"No. He simply spoke of his "confidential
Instructions from the Secretary of the -Navy."
'On May; 18."
"Yes. I do not think the regulations pro

The Judge advocate ' questioned Admiral
Schley as to the identity . of the Cubans who
had informed him at Hampton Roads that the
portion of the Island of Cuba west of Havana
and Cienfuegos was well held by the Spanish
soldiers. He replied that he could .not give
the names; that they were Cubans who had
come to him as commander of the flying squad
ron to give him that information. \u25a0
Schley -was closely questioned as; to who was
present in the cabin of the New York at I Key
West when he talked over the campaign with
Admiral Sampson. Admiral Schley, replied that
Captain Chadwlck had been present part of
the time. . \u25a0 ' .. . \u25a0 . .- '
"When was this?"
Captain Lemly" stated 'that the Iowa left Key
West at U a. m. on May 20. and gained in her
trip about thirty-one : hours on the squadron. \u25a0

the confidential orders .received t rom ,â¢ Admiral
Sampson and \ called the witness' attention to

As a large portion of the army is stA
tioned in the western part of this United
States and over half west of the Pacific
Ocean. General Miles recommends the es
tablishment of a military post in South
ern California. He also recommends the
establishment of a war college in the city
of Washington.
General Miles refers to a number cf"
recommendat'ons which he made in for
mer reports looking to the improvement
of the condition of the army; also to or
ders he has issued during the year to ac
complish this purpose, i He speaks espe
cially of the experienc*, intelligence and
efficiency of the troops of the Unite!
States and the success tney have had '.n
China and the Philippines, and says they
have borne the rigors of the Arctic cli
mate in Alaska and the heat of the
tropics, and under all circumstances
maintained the character of the Ameri
can army. He recommends that the mili
tary posts throughout the country be put
in excellent shape for troops that are re-Â»
turned from service beyond the seas.
While Congress has made ample provision for
the management of military affairs In the or
ganization of the army, whereby the companies,
regiments, brigade*, divisions and departments
are made the units of administration and by
statute has clothed the officials not only -with
executive authority but with judicial powers
and responsibility, yet the tendency has been
to absorb and usurp the entire conduct of the
military establishment in the city of Washing
ton, and especially in the staE departments.
This has been found most injurious in other
armies and is one of the principal defects in
our own system. The evil has been Increasing
during the activities of the wars of the last
three years to an extent that, in my Judgment,
requires serious consideration, and I recommend
that decentralization be effected as far as pob
eible and that all proper and lawful authority
be restored to eubordinate commanders who are
provided with an efficient organization and who
\u25a0 can be safely Intrusted with responsibility for
the efficient and faithful administration of
military affairs commensurate with their im
portant commands.
General Miles does not approve of the
present organization of the artillery
corps, saying that it establishes another
bureau in Washington. He believes in
the former regimental organizations*.
Speaking of the army canteen, which is
abolshed by the army reorganization law,
he says that no injury has resulted, and
in the main the law has been beneficial.
General Miles states his objections to
the management of military affairs in the
War Department in the following lan
guage :
WASHINGTON. Oct. 28.â Lieutenant
General Miles, in his annual report, gives
the "otal strength of the army at pres
ent at S4.513. of which number 33,S74 are
In the United States; 43,238 in the Philip
pines; 4?14 in Cuba, and ths remainder in
small detachments being in Porto Rico,
Hawaii, China and Alaska. He says it
is expected that the force In Cuba will
be very much reduced and hopes that the
force iu the Philippines also can be re
duced.
The crowd present to-day, while hardly
so large as on Friday last, when Admirai
Schley told the story of the battle of
Santiago, showed unabated interest in the
proceedings. Nothing sensational devel
oped, ana the only outburst in the court
occurred when Raynor, Admiral Schley's
counsel,. objected to a line of inquiry. 01
the judge advocate designed to - criticise
Admiral Schley's alleged failure to form
ulate a plan of battle, witn the declara
tion that as Admiral Sampson was in
command, the junior haa no right to plan
an order of battle.
Admiral Schley concluded his direct ex
amination, which occupied only about ten
minutes after the court convened this
morning, with a statement of the effect
of thÂ« fire of the respective* ships, show
ing that 36 per cent of the hits suffered
by the enemy were 'scored by the Brok
lyn's live-inch guns, while his ship reÂ»
ceived 75 per cent of the hits from the
Spanish ships. \u25a0 - -
Captain Lemiy's cross-examination was
very searching. Admiral Schley, how
ever, appeared to be unruffled throughout
the examination, frankly admitting on
several occasions that he could not re
member little details after the lapse of
three years. One line of inquiry which
the judge advocate tried to press to show
that Admiral Schley did not proceed
"with dispatch" from Key West to Cien
fuegos, â¢ by attempting to ' contrast the
speed between Charleston and Key West
and between Key West and Cienfuegos,
was curtailed by a decision of the court,
which confined the questions to the time
subsequent to May 19, the date on whicli
the flying squadron Key West. The
judge advocate in His cross-examination
dwelt upon the interview between Admi
rals Sampson and Schley at Key West
before the departure of the flying squad
ron, at which the latter testified that Ad
miral Sampson Instructed him not to ex
pose his ship3 to shore batteries until
the Spanish fle<;t had been destroyed; on
the fact that Admiral Schley issued no
written order of battle: on the question
of coaling off Cienfuegos and the steps
Schley took there to ascertain the pres
ence of the Spanish fleet. He was cross
examining the witness upon matters con
nected with the cruise of' the squadroi
from Cienfuegos to Santiago \u25a0 when tho
court adjourned. The retrograde move
ment, the firing upon the Colon and the
battle of Santiago, which constitute tho
main features of the precept, . were not
touched upon to-day. .-
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28â The
cross-examination of Admiral
â¢Schley began to-day before
the court of inquiry, and
hardly more than a third o?
the ground was covered when the court
adjourned at 4 o'clock,:. After Admiral
Schley concludes to-morrow, two other
witnesses will be called in his behalf, Ad
miral Barker and Captain Thomas Bor
den. The latter was an officer of the Ma
rine Corps aboard the v Brooklyn. The
judge advocate will then call his wit
nessed in rebuttal, of whom there are un
derstood to be more than fifteen, and it is
probable that Admiral Schley's , counsel
will call witnesses on rebuttal. .

LONDON, Oct. 28.â At the resumption
of the sitting of the South African Com
pensation Commission to-day, Major Gen
eral Sir John C. Ardagh, on behalf of the
Government, announced that all claims of
foreign countries had been settled dlpU*
matically, with the exception oi vavÂ»*
of the Netherlands ana .France, as fol
lows: â¢ ,
The United States, Â£6000; Austria, Â£15.

Â£12,000; Spain, Â£150; Sweden and Norway.
Â£1000; Switzerland, Â£250; Belgium, Â£300.
and Denmark, JS25O.
It is expected that the claims of Franca
and the Netherlands will be settled this
week. , '
.General Ardagb. said the Government
has consented *o an amicable settlemenc
on the ground that the claimants haU
suffered individual hardships and loss for
which they were entitled to considera
tion, although they might fail to substan
tiate legal claims. The sums awarde-I
will be distributed to the claimants, by
their respective governments.
Newton Crane, who represents the
United States before the commission, re
gards the settlement as most favorable
for the American claimants, of whom.
there are only fifteen. The average, after
the expenses are deducted, will be Â£333
for the_Americans, against Â£63 for th-a
claimants of other countries. All the
American claimants will not share equal
ly, as some of them have not been natu
ralized and others have fought for the
Boers.
"The terms are generous," said Crane,
"inasmuch as no court would have com
pelled Great Britain to pay the money."
The amount is 14 per cent of the claims,
while the award under the treaty o'
Washington to British subjects who suf
fered through the Civil War was 3 per
cent. . :

"Did not he say large vessels could coal

about that time which I think will make the

munication now is that It referred entirely ! to
the coaling of smaller vessels. I do not see
here (looking at the log he held in his hand),
however that any reference is made to the
Hayti coast \u25a0 in the telegram of May , 28. The
reason I say that is because the impression
left by the communication of Captain Cotton
upon my mind was . that the ports of both
Gonaives and Mole St. Nicholas. Haytl (I
never had been in either), were so contracted
that nothing but small \u25a0 vessels could' coal

cause when one Is blockading a port he could
not entirely abandon it and take all his ships

questions to develop the state of the weather
on May 24. Various officers had testified that
they boarded the Brooklyn in small boats.. The

"When Captain McCalla gave you the in
formation with regard to the Spanish fleet not
being In Cienfuegos did you determine to leave
for Santiago that day?"' â¢
-"I think I did. That is my impression. I
remember to have sent a dispatch in which I
said that I might leave in the morning. I had
in view at that time the sending of the Scor
pion, which I had sent . east feeling that she
might bring me some necessary information."
"Here Is your letter of May 24, in which you
say:. 'I have ascertained from the insurgents
that the Spanish fleet is not In this port. As It
is not found practicable to coal the Texas here,
I shall proceed to-morrow for Santiago, being
embarrassed by the Texas' short coal supply
and our Inability to coal In the open sea.' That
Is correct is it not?" >
"Yes; I said that."
"In a dispatch that you sent to Commodore

."-'.'Undoubtedly: "In June, we coaled consider
ably, there, but on one occasion we cast off
after coaling for an hour or so. As our ex
perience increased we got on better, and,
furthermore, the later colliers were better
arranged than the former.-"
"There are some difficulties about coaling at
sea generally, are there not?"
"There are, and I think ws met them."
\u25a0â¢ "Did you consult any of -your captains about
coaling on the 26th?" . â¢ \u25a0'
\u25a0 "I did not. I preferred to act upon my own
Judgment," .

"On the 27th and 2Sth some vessels coaled,
also on the 31st, but I do not recall about the
29th and 30th." * , . â¢ .
"Had you less coal when you arrived off

that they could have made It longer."
"J. mean to cruise around from point to point
and get It. Did they rely at any time upon the
colliers of the squadron to supply them with
coal?"
" "Yes.- sir."
"In view of the idea you had of preserving
the squadron as a unit, why did you detach
the Eagle?"
"Simply because she was an impediment. I
did not think it possible to coal her In that
state of the weather. I used to consider my
self weather-wise, now I find I am sometimes
Otherwise." (Laughter.)
"Tou testified that you received a signal from
Lieutenant Boutherland that the Eagle was
dangerously short of coal/'

of the Eagle to show that on May 26 (the day
she was detached) . she had 'twenty-eight tons
of icoal aboard. . â¢ â¢ .
. 'TVhy did you not take the Eagle. Vixen ard

"Because, in my opinion that woud have
been poor military policy. It would not do
to abandon auxiliaries where they might have
been picked up by the enemy.. Such a course
would have been censurable."
To Intercept the Enemy.
Asked why. If he believed the enemy's ves
sels had. left Santiago before he left Cienf uegos,
he had not dispersed his. vessels more widely
in order to intercept them, the admiral said
that that was a military 'disposition about
which there might be reasonable difference of
opinion. Such a .disposition, would, have ren
dered' the smaller vessels more liable to at

Now, I wilt give you another instance. â¢ Some
years ago the franchise of one of the railroads
In the Western Addition was about to expirp.
A man in -this city, a capitalist, who. owned
the' railroad at the time, wished to secure a
renewal of the franchise. He went to the man
who controlled the Board of Supervisors at
that timeâ and you all know him, his name is
famous, and Infamous, tooâ and he said to
that man: "I want this franchise renewed.
What can I get it for?" And he said to himâ
this story was told to me the other day by the
man who made the proposition, tfce- capitalist
who owned the road â and the man who con
trolled the , board said to him: ."I will renew
Did they fail to take advantage of it as an
opportunity for stealing the public funds?. No.
it was proposed to buy Mission Rock, a deso
late rock about a mile from the shore â¢ of
Butchertown, which was worth at most about
$500. It is a rock about fifty feet square, stand
ing alone, open to the winds, in the middle of
the bay. They proposed to pay for that rock,
worth $500, the sum of {15,000. Where was the
$14,500 to go, ladies and gentlemen? It was to
go Into the- same capacious maw that has swal
lowed millions of the dollars raised in 'this city
and county by taxation, and the many, many
millions of dollars raised besides . by: the cor
rupt bribery of corporations. We came .into of
flce, gentlemen, when that scheme was almost
carried out, but at the last moment it was ex
posed. It was exposed in the press, there was
an outcry on. the part of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, on the part of the capitalists interested,
ana the thing was stopped. We came into of
fice and the same subject was raised. How did
we provide for it? The Merchants' Association
proposed to us a site which they said could be
purchased for $15,000. We chose three reputable
real estate agents to appraise that site. They
appraised it at $15,000. We were not satisfied.
We made a provision in the budget for the pur-,
chase of that site for $12,000. and last week the
sale was about completed at that figure.
Business Methods.
Ladles and Gentlemen: I see that I have been
quoted as making a speech at the banquet at
notes and in addition to my other misfortunes
I had the misfortune to lose them.
Mr. Brandenstein has spoken to you of the
old order of things and the new order which
the charter inaugurated and which we, the
first officials under the new administration, did
our best to carry out. I will give you an ex
ample under the old order of things: For some
time It was a crying shame in the city of San
Francisco that there was no adequate accom-*
modation for any person the victim oi a con
tagious disease. The habitation that was af
forded them was unfit for the habitation of a
dog. To make the necessary improvement it
Was determined to buy a new site for a pest
house. Now this, ladies and gentlemen, is a
subject that' should have appealed to the heart
of any man, no matter, how calloused it might
have been; no matter how hardened it might
have been by political life, by political . cor
ruption and by political debauchery.,

There was a sigh of relief on the stage
where the candidates sat when the sud
ject was dropped without the mention of
Herrin's name.- Throughout his speech
Mr. Shortridge spoke as If he really sup
posed that the Republicans had some
thing to siay In the nomination of the Re
publican ticket. He did not tell his hear
ers that the delegates to the convention
were never consulted about the nomina
tions. . The gifted, but forgetful, orator
failed to tell his -hearers that Wells got
his nomination from D. M. Burns and W.
P. Herrin.

whooping-up attracted an audience. â¢ The
main floor of the hall and some of the
seats in the gallery were occupied when
the meeting was called to order by
Thomas D. Riordan, who introduced
"The Colored Trio of the Forty-third
Assembly District." Horace Wilson, who
was chosen to preside, j introduced Sam
uel M. Shortridge as Charles M., but cor
rected the error in a second edition of his
remarks. Â«In his eloquent address Sam
uel paid a tribute to the heroism of. the
colored troops at San Juan hill. In fur
ther discussion of local affairs he pre
dicted the nomination of Theodore Koose
.velt for the Presidency In 1304.
In extolling the administration of
Henry T. Gage, the orator mentioned the
appointment by the Governor of several
citizens to consider plague conditions.
The names of John P. -Young-. Fremont
Older, Henry T. Scott and T. T. "Williams
were recollected, but one name slipped
the memory of the orator. At least he
told the audience that there was one he
did not think of. Everybody on tb,e in
side knew that "William F. Herrin was
the man whose name ihe orator could not
rtien pronounce. The candidates, who are
"getting on to their jobs," did not prompt
the forgetful Sam.

Mr. Chairman, ladies and: gentlemen: I am
not able to appear to you In very stirring words
this evening. I have traveled over the entire
city to-day, and In addition to the physical ex
ertion I lost the few notes that I had prepared
on my way here.
I am told that in an afternoon paper, which I
never read â not that the reading of it would
disturb my equanimity of temper, but because
it does not print any news (laughter)â I am
told that this afternoon paper reprinted a story
from the Examinerâ to which the Examiner,
by the way. was fair enough to append my de
nial â I am told that this statement is repeated
in an afternoon paper, the reputation of -which
is entlrely(?) established, and the proprietor,
whose character for honesty, integrity and im
peccability la so well established it would do
me no harm to deny. Conscious as I am. ladies
and gentlemen, of all these things, I tUink it
will do me no harm to deny absolutely, wholly
and completely the entire story.
It is false in whole, it is false in part. The
very fact that I voted for the passage of thfs
bill, the very fact that it was passed by the
entire Board of Supervisors without a dissent
ing voice, is answer enough to this. This is
the statement of a thing without honor, a thing
that creeps, a thing without honesty. Gen
tlemen, this is the statement of a thins that
has grown fat and loathsome upon blackmail.
Gentlemen. I cannot soil my hands nor my
tongue further to-night. . I shall allude no
further to such people. I hold them in the con
tempt which their base character merits;.
We say," have we done well or ill' by the citi
zens? If we have done well. - then you - must
support us. -whether you are Republicans or
whether you are Democrats. If we^have no'.
then you must discharge us. no matter what
our party affiliations maybe. â¢*..* ".

I believe that corporation waa then, in exist
ence, the largest street railway corporation â
would ha.ve purchased that franchise for a
great deal more than $40,000 from the ring in
the Board of Supervisors. All he could do was
to say: "Well, what guarantee have I If I
pay you the $40,000 that I will get the fran
chise?" â¢ < Oh." he said, "that is all rtglrt; if
I give you my word for it you win have it:

LABOR CANDIDATES SPEAK.
tiD has been given out from
II the headquarters of the allied cor-
I porations that everything can be
UL thrown overboard as a last resort
to save Wells from defeat. All
the other candidates on his ticket are to
be Facrfflced to pull Wells through. The
trading and the knifing cause indignation
among Republican nominees, and every
man is bent on saving himself. The utter
defeat of Wells seems inevitable. . The
poor impression that he made in the be
ginning of the campaign in saying that
Mr. Herrin agreed with him that B. P.
Flint should go on the ticket has not been
removed by his subsequent utterances.
Voters who heard his speech at Garibaldi
Hall last week thought it was the worst
campaign speech ever made until they
heard his talk at B'nai B'rith Hall last
night. Every time that the corporation
nominee for Mayor makes any attempt
to discuss living questions he displays a
lamentable ignorance of the public af
fairs. If his managers would prepare and
typewrite something for him -and charge
him particularly to read it and not rely
on his memory to repeat it, he would
make a much better impression than he
has yet made. The worst feature of the
whole affair from one point of view is that
Sam Shortridge. who is out getting a rep
utation for ora-tory, is using poor Wells
as a foil. Sam shows off to tine advan
tage as a speaker in comparison with
Wells.
Bosses Imploring' Lieutenants.
The bosses who put Wells at the head
of the ticket are sending out for the dis
trict leaders who are not in line and im
ploring them to get in for Wells.
Promises of support in the next cam
paign are fr?ely given. The balky leaders
are not asked to support the Supervisors
or candidates other than Mayor, but just
to get in and save the head of the ticket
from ruin. Everything now points to the
defeat of Wells. Republican merchants,
property owners and taxpayers generally
have resolved to support Tobin. In the
Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Forty
fourth and Forty-fifth districts there is a
strong Republican tendency toward the
support of Schmitz. Politicians who have
studied the situation estimate that Wells
will not get one-half the Republican vote
of the city. Two weeks ago the betting
was even money for Wells against the
field. There has been a complete turn
about since. The only Wells money
Offered is on a proposition of Tobin
against the field.
Promises of Places.
The recent order of the bosses to cut
everybody to save Wells Is inciting a
spirit of hostility toward the head of
the boss ticket. From now on Herrin and
Burns will draw freely on the brick
yard. Everything in the way of patronage
at the City Hall will be plastered with
ten layers of promises in order to catch
votes for the head of the ticket. It is
quite evident that the "boys" who want
recognition will not be fooled again. >Iany
of the promises made in the Senatorial
canvass and In the campaign last fall
have not been kept. Sam Rainey Is do
ing his hardest work to save Wells from
defeat* but his followers are cutting loose
to save something for themselves.
Gennans Support Tobin.

Alviso will probably experience a boom,
for within a month a line of automobiles
will be running between that place and
San Jose, and another electric road, to
be built by San Jose capital, is among
the possibilities.
A 1 fast steamer service between Al
viso and San Francisco will connect with
the new road, and that it -will be an ac
tive competitor with the Southern Pacific
for freight and passengers is assured.
' The' purchasers were here a few weeks
ago looking over the ground, but they
left without disclosing their plans. A
lme terminal site of sixty acres goes with
tha property. It is right on tidewater
at Alvlso, and now that the government
has just completed dredging the slough
the property is valuable. The right. of
way is sixty feet -wide, and extends a
distance of eight miles. The old plan of
the San Jose and^Alviso Railroad in
tended the terminal to be near the Hotel
Vendome. and It Is believed this new cor
poration, has made arrangements for sta
tion facilities in about the same place.
Only light grading will have to be done,
and it would take but a few months'
work to put the line into operation..
Just who is back of the project ia
not known, and one rumor has it that the
road will be used for the Santa Fe,
which will make boat connection at Al
viso. Work 13 to be rushed, and, it Is
said, cars will be running in a few
months.

Communication with Asia is most important
to u s at present because our trade will be with
Asia, not with Europe. The Islands as coal-
Ing stations and bases of naval supplies are
of infinite importance for protection of our line
of communication.
Communication â that is. forming lines of
commerce â affects greatly national expansion.
The acquisition of Porto Rico, Hawaii and the
Philippines is Important in that these points
ere necessary in completing our lines of com
munication. The United States has been par
ticu:ar!y fortunate in stumbling upon such pos
sefs.ons as she has acquired in the Philippines
and Hawaii.
What are the motives operative in bringing
al>out the development from the national state
to national imperialism? Colonization has been
dÂ«=flnÂ»d as the exertion of Influence by a. more
hip-hly civilized state over a less highly civil
ized state, with the purpose of elevating the
latter. Migration of Chinese to the United
States is not colonization, therefore, nor is the
migration of an entire nation to a new demaln.
The motives or causes In the development of
national imperlali-m are: Overpopulation, mis
sionaries, the adventuresome spirit of Individ
uals, commerce, communication, industrial de
velopment, direct occupation of territory with
the idea of enlarging the national power. Over
population is seldom a cause of colonizing at
lirft but It keeps ur> colonies once organized.
Missionaries are of far greater Importance. In
ca.Â«e of nations having low forms of religion
missionaries can often have direct influence
on :;he government. In countries like China
and India, however, their Influence Is more
indirect because of the large number of persons
to influence and the strong pre-established re
ligicn. The murder of missionaries has often
led to the conquest of territory.
Individual adventure is a most important mo
tive in the expansion of European interests.
Commercial expansion Is another important
xnot.ve. Present world politics is to-Â«. certain
extent a struggle for markets. All nations
begi.n making the commerce of their colonies
the exclusive possession of the mother country.
Wits the growth of Liberalism these restric
tions fell and by 1S60 the policy of free trade
\u25a0was In full sway. Recently, however, the ar-
KUir,ent that "commerce follows the flag" has
beer. made, reviving the old idea. Statistics
Fhow that the greater commerce is between
rival nations, consequently it would be utter
felly to chop off the trade of other nations In
order to secure the colonial trade.
ThÂ« idea that there will be a world unity Is
looking coo far Into the future to be politically
practical. National imperialism is a new de
velopment, but it does not lead of necessity
to a world-state. Roman imperialism had as
Its core a city-state and as its aim the con
<iues: of other cities. The core of our present
cyetrm is the national state. National imper
ialism recognizes a number of national sys
tems.
J'hÂ«ire may be said to be five stages in the
evolution of political society. First, the agrl
cuUurai etaee. where the clan was paramount;
tecord, the stage of caste or feudal society;
third, the city stage, as first developed in
Greece, where aristocratic caste privileges were
discarded and all freemen were equal, with
the rower not extending beyond the city's lim
its; fourth, the territorial stage, where the
cities or States were united under -political
leadersâ princes and kingsâ the unity being ter
ritorial and artificial; fifth, the national stage,
in wlaich the world powers are to-day.
The English Llberalists believe in the fourth
Ftagt. Individualism without governmental in
terference is the basis of Liberalismâ hence the
doctrine of free trade. We are gradually
throwing over the Liberal idea that govern
ment is a mere mechanism and are recogniz
ing i.he fact that we are integral parts of the
gove-nment.

Uurlng the two decades from 1850 to 1S70
hardly a statesman In England, Prance or
Geriracy was enthusiastic on the subject of
colonies. At this time Gladstone and other
English statesmen looked forward to the ulti
mate separation of the British colonies from
the raothcr country and they believed such ac
tion advisable. John Bright, In speaking of
Canada, said that It would be allowed to choose
Us courseâ either to -separate from or remain

cessively. So, after two hours of haggling
and testimony taking before the Commis
sioner the lawyers and witnesses flocked
out of one courtroom and settled them;
selves in the other. The scene was
changed from a rather informal court to
the dignified procedure of the Federal-tri
bunal, with the three Justices,- Gilbert,
Ross and Morrow, on the bench.' .
Heney made a statement of the Britt
episode and asked the court to issue, an
order compelling the witness to answer
the question. For the sake of argument
Heney was willing to consider the, ques
tion whether Britt was biased or preju
diced, as already asked. : The reason of
the question, Heney stated to the court,
was to attack the credibility of the wit
ness. The three Judges: put their heads
together p.nd Judge Gilbert announced
that the objection was sustained.
Then the court had to listen to another
argument from the wrangling .' attorneys.
Judge McLaughlin wants a letter which
he thinks E. S. Pillsbury has In his pos
session. During the taking of testimony
in the morning Judge Johnson of Nome
was recalled to the stand and cross-ex
amined on a letter which he signed and
which it is claimed was sent to Pills
bury, asking for the protection of W. T.
Hume and his immunity from punish
ment on account of his efforts to furnish
information against the Noyes I regime.
McLaughlin demanded that the letter be
produced. Pillsbury, without denying or
admitting the receipt of the letter, said
he didn't see by what right the respon
dents should ask for private papers.,

Heney came into the courtroom yester
day morning, his heart surcharged with
indignation and his temper bristling at all
points. In yesterday's- Call there appeared
on the last page an article concerning
Judge Noyes, McKenzie and the rest of
the Nome ring. Heney had read it before
coming into court. So had Judge Mc-
JLaughlin and the two sang a duet, "Scan
dalous! Scandalous!" every time The
Call's article came to their '.'. attention.
When Heney reached the tail end of his
cross-examination he asked Britt: : \u25a0 >
"Did you write that article in * to-day's
Call headed â¢ 'Weeding Out Noyes' Gang
Up at Nome'?" .. ... '
Britt declined to answer, and neither. the
soft cajolery of- Heney's voice "nor\hW
brusque, impatient manner could ; induce
the witness to go ' further, i Heney's '-opa
tience gave out finally and he took? the
matter before the Circuit Court of/Ap

"Are you unfriendly to him?"
On Another Tack,

it is unprofessionarto say whether I did

Deputy Marshal Burnham, who served
the writs on McKenzie, took the stand
at the opening of the morning session.
He testified that Judge Noyes visited' Mc-

He left McKenzlcin Geary's offices and
saw Noyes in the rooms. Thomas J.

whether it should go into. the record or
not. Pillsbury declared that he was
East when the letter arrived, if it ever
came to his office, and that he had no
recollection of seeing it at any time. ThÂ©
judicial , whisper was passed again and
the amicus curiae i was . requested to
favor the court with the letter.
Argument three was next -heard. Judge
McLaughlin, who has been ill during the
last few days, was on hand to flght this
battle. He said that owing to the char
acter of the testimony that had been
read and entered in the record he wished
the court to designate just which por
tions should be met, and he masked for
time to present- this matter to the: court.
Pillsbury and Heney came into this con
flict of words and so did Judge Maguire,
who begged of the court to .decide ' the
Geary contempt at once as all the. evi
dence was taken on this case. .The court
told Maguire hewa's one of- many, and
that he -should wait until all the testi
mony was Inscribed for their Judicial
cognizance. Judge McDaughlin was /given
until to-day at 11 o'clock to present his
arguments for a continuance. ;
REDDING, Oct. 28.â Pathetic is the
case of .John N. Gatherne, a youris Eng
lishman of good - family, who came to
Redding for his health some time ago.
His mind failed and he was committed to
Napa Asylum. His wealthy parents have
hurried over from England to his succor,
only to be confronted at the asylum by
the refusal of the authorities to allow
them to take their boy home with them.
Gatherne came to Redding more than
a year ago. He had been in delicate
health at the country seat of his parents
in England, and it was hoped the change
would benefit him. It Is now said he hai
suffered some mental trouble. A friend
had assured Gatherne in London of the
wlldness of the country and its necessi
ties, and he arrived with seven trunks full
of outlandish cowboy outfits, small arms
and ammunition. He joined the English
colony, rode the range for his health, be
came popular socially and ranked as one
of the best tennis players of the county.
A month ago Gatherne became pos
sessed of the hallucination that he was
being pursued by murderers. He grew
violent and was put in a padded cell. In
a week he was liberated, with a guard,
and his condition was cabled to his par
ents. No answer came back. Gatherne
grew violent again and was committed
to Napa Insane Asylum by Judge Edward
Sweeney.
It seems that J. Gatherne and his wif?
sailed immediately from London upon
learning of their son's dementia. Tney
wired ahead * while coming, from New
York, and learning that he was in Napa.
went thither. The officials, when aske-J
to allow them to take their son, who is
no longer violent, back to England, sai3
they had no power to do so after his com
mitment. The' distracted parents came
here and learned the full circumstances
and to-day went back to Napa. They
will take the case into court, if possible,
in an attempt to force the delivery of
their unfortunate son to them.

Homer Bird, who has once been sen
tenced to death for murder in Alaska, is
again on trial for his life in Juneau.
About six years ago Bird, in company
with three male .comrades and one fe
male, were gold prospecting on the Yu
kon. They were living on a small boat.
According to the testimony introduced,
Bird shot two of his companions without
cause and drove another ashore. The
woman escaped. Bird was caught through
the' efforts of the man who was driven
ashore. He was tried, convicted adn
sentenced to be hanged, but was granted
a new trial through technicalities.

SITKA, Alaska, Oct. 19 (via Seattle,
Oct. 28).â According. to reliable informa
tion recently received here, the. Rodman
Bay, mines are likely to exceed in magni
tude the famous Treadwell mines on
Douglass Island. Rodman Bay is about
sixty miles from Sitka and the mines are
located on Baranoff Island, in a valley
eight miles from tidewater. The mines
are' operated by the Rodman Bay Com
pany, a corporation financed principally
with English capital.
The ore tested shows itself to be of a
low grade, but in -great, quantity. It. is

The taking of testimony in the Nome contempt cases before Commissioner Hcacock was
interrupted yesterday by arguments made on motion before the Circuit Court of Appeals. The Gov
ernment' has finished its cast;, with the exception of placing two. other zvitnesseson the stand, men
who have not yet arrived from Nome. To-day the attorneys representing the respondent, Arthur
H. Noyes/ will appear before Judges Ross, Morrow and Gilbert, sitting as the Circuit Court of
Appeals, and ask* for a continuance until such time as the court may designate just what portion
of the testimony already' taken shall be met by them. They allege that the testimony so far pro

MR. 'ASQUITH, who ranks among the fore
most Liberals in Parliament, recently- ad
Â« dressed his constituents on the issues of \he
day, and_ in doing so brought to .. .public
once more the fact that the Salisbury Ministry is in
power only because the, Liberals cannot' -frame a
programme of' work on which they will agree. In a
recent contest at Lanark,' where a strong majority pf
the voters are Liberals, the seat was won by a Con
servative because of divisions in the Liberal ranks.'
The socialists put up a candidate against the party
nominee and a considerable Irish element in the pop
ulation voted with the socialists, so that it was a
walkover for the supporters of the Ministry. . '.-
The Conservatives who are thus, profiting, by ,the
mistakes of -their have done nothing^to
deserve public confidence. "It is not only that their
predictions concerning the war have been invariably
discredited by the events, and that the intelligence
of the country now perceives that the nation was hur
ried into a wasteful and bloody struggle by blunder
ing" or worse on the part of the Ministers, but that
the home policy of the Government has been as futile
a's its military policy. .
'In'his'.address. Mr. Asquith said: ''The country
has, in my belief, Httle affettipn* for, and. still less
confidence in, -its present rulers." Never has there
been so little to show as a restiltbf six years of power
âsix years during which anj&lmost t . unexampled ma
jority in-the. House of Commb'ns-.ha's been able to act
uritrammele'd and A unchecked ; by-its docile -partner in
ihe .House-,of Lords^/ What use have the Government
made iff so "unprecedented^ an . .^opportunity ? f What
liave .they done tp improve the social"^onditions and
to brighten the lives of the people? Gentlemen,, they
have tinkered at housing; they have fumbled with
education; they have procrastinated- over temp'er
arice,' and -they 'have played' the game of battledore
and shuttlecock with old-age pensions. And even
their one considerable achievement in -the domain of
social reformâthe workmen's- compensation act of
1897 â is so honeycombed with exceptions and con
tradictions* that^iThas become the , despair .an-d the
laughing-stock /of the Judges of England." - - :\u25a0..
'-.On that 'shpwing; there is clearly a need fora betr
ter Government in-Great Britain^. but the opposition
is- unable to offer it.: The socialists have no desire
to put the Liberals into power, a'nd the Irish party
has taken such a stand with ; relation to the union withi
England that jMr.^Asquith 'declares ' he. would; not
agree for the Liberal party to take office: if its'con
trol of jPariiament were .dependent upon Irish votes.'
It would seem: that his position in that respect is
justified by the facts/ for it is certain the Irish- are
acting for themselves and would not be a reliable
part ot any governmental majority except "where an
Irish measure favored by them '.^vas .under cdhside'ra- 1

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Only one public man-in the South has denounced
snd deprecated the wcrk of Washington among the
'members of his race, and that is the inexpressible
Tillman of South Carolina, who declares that the in
dustrial education of the negro is a detriment to the
country! We do not believe that the Maryland
voters wiil be influenced by caricatures of the Presi
'dent or his wife, but if they. can be this ie a good time
! to find it. out.
The North has not been harsh nor hasty with. the
South in its struggle with the race problem. ,Jf that
struggle is for the preservation of society there is no
to interfered. But if.it is a manifestation
of mere prejudice, an .outbreak of personal ' hatred
and a sodden and sordid expression of enmity tcrthe
negro for. wjiat he can't help, his color" and his racial
character, the views of the -North are subject to
change and the power of the constitution may be in
voked to protect thexWack 'man, who, left to himself,
ctn^proteet his- rights only, by the miracle of changing
his skin. To reasonable men it appears that when a
negro, bd.rn.in slavery, raises .himself by his own ex
ertions and genius as Booker Washington has* done,'
U'is.the first duty of, good citizenship to. recognize
.and encourage him.: : It goes- without saying that if
all, or a majority, or a large fraction, of the negroes
' in this country were, equal. to.: h'im, it would be better
for the country and a glad thing for both races. -
Therefore, by encouraging him t let others.be en
couraged to be like him. : . President Roosevelt .^ has
.acted from a profound philosophy and in line ', with
the peace and 'welfare of his country by- giving' this
foremost negro in the world the recognition mer
ited by his talents, training and work.
*.'. Those who turn it into an appeal to prejudice and
, ignorance arÂ« not acting" from philosophy nor patriot
} ism. Their motive is the ; s6rdid J bne of office-getting.
Professor Washington has hot regretted the wresting
of the ballot and .of political power from the South
ern negro,, for he sees 'no good to him in the posses
sion of -a\power that he does -not know how to use.
His object is to enlarge the: negro's means of liveli
. hood by manual training, .increasing his knowledge
snd-his-skili in the economic use of his capacity. -He
wants him educated to want a better house,, to .be bet
ter clad, to own real property and to be trained to get
all these by his own exertions. One may well pity
a man who has no sympathy for such a work and no
encouragement for the earnest man who has started
and prosecuted it s'o promisingly among the "people
.of his race. "â¢ "\u25a0\u25a0 ' : . - \./' ' ;'C-- '\u25a0\u25a0i." v -\ â¢ \ .

ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT.
CZARâ E. G., City. Czar is the English
designation of the Emperor of, Russia.
The Russian Is Tzare, with the e mute.
It is a corruption of the Latin Caesar.
The Russians also use Tsar. In that lan
guage Czarttza and Tsaritsa are the
equivalent of Czarina. Tzar, sometimes
Tsar, is the form*, while the Russian la
Tsare. One etymologist asserts that Czar
Is derived from the old Slavonic language
and signifies very much the same as the
German Kaiser and the Latin Caesar, to
which it probably owes Its origin. Somo
etymologists identify it with the termina
tion of the names of the old Assyrian
kings, such as Phalassar, Nabonassar and
Nabopolassar. The title of Tsare was first
given to the Grand Duke Vladimir, who
reigned 950 to 1015.
Never having tried either of the methods
this department cannot say anything as
to their efficacy. Â»
TO REMOVE VARNISH-E., City. The
following are given as methods to remove
varnish from an oil painting: "Remove
the picture from the 'frame. "Wash tho
painting with a weak solution of carbo
nate of ammonia, wiping it off with a
sponge wetted with water as soon as it
has fulfilled its purpose. If allowed to
remain too long it will Injure: the oil col
ors. Another way is to spread a thick
coat of wet fuller's earth over the surface
of the varnish, leaving it on long enough
to soften it. It may then be removed by
washing."
The "Ligue Contre le Mai de Mer" may
/never be able to discover a way of totally
preventing seasiekness, but it may be
able to so direct and instruct people in
hygienic methods that an ocean voyage
will cease to be-the martyrdom that it
: now is for those who are "poor sailors "
For example, one will know whether or
not it is advisable to eat heartily before
embarking, and what kind of food must
be taken. It is evident that if among a
thousand persons who have eaten before
embarking there is found, to be^a greater
number of cases of seasickness than
among the same number of .persons who
have not eaten, the main part of the ques
tion will have already, been answered.
As soon as the Ligue has a sufficient
number of adherents to constitute a
strong "moral force" It " will endeavor to
bring to bear a pressure that will oblige
the steamship companies to follow the
elementary. rules of hygiene in the mat
ter of table fare. It will also give its
support to the inventors of suspension ap
paratus .that are intended to counteract
the motion of 'vessels.
a general correspondence on thfs vital
topic, and letters are coming in by thou
sands. From the tone of the majority "of
these letters it will be possible to ascer
tain under what conditions seasiskness is
developed In the majority of persons, and
consequently a definite problem can be
proposed for solution.
PERSONAL MENTION.
I" T is Impossible that all - the persons
â¢ who have ever suffered from seasick
ness have heard of the.Ligue Contre
le'Mal de Mer. It is also improbable
that' those who have "paid their trib
ute" from the ship's deck would hesitate
very long about paying a visit to the
headquarters of this well meaning Ligue
if they were reasonably certain of learn
ing how the terrors of seasickness could
be averted. . ....
The object of the "League Against Sea
sickness" is to bring together all -those
who are "interested" in the' subject of
seasickness as a result ; of having had
practical experience in that line and who
want to be rendered immune fo'r all time.
The Matin remarks that the Frenchman
who has once had' seasickness will never
travel on the perfidious element again as
long as he can travel on land, and that
this explains the lack of colonial develop
ment on the. part of the French and some
of the difficulties experienced by that na
tion In Its relation with other countries.
The Ligue Contre le Mai de Mer is hope
ful of .being able, to do something practi
cal with this malady, which is so regu
larly made a subject of ridicule. on land,
but which is sometimes such a serious
matter on board ship' that the victims
would' like^ to 'be thrown Into the -sea.

FOUR years have passed since S. A.
Andree started for; the North Pole;
in a "balloon. ' . The Swedish courts
, have declared that the explorer
may legally be supposed to be dead.
Andree's; own extreme limit ot time has
passed, geographers agree that he is lost,
his own brother has accepted the bequests
made to him in Andree's will; yet his
mother ; and his sister are still confident
that he is alive and will return. -
-These two .women * live at Grenna in
Sweden. They keep themselves ready to
receive him any day or night and dust and
clear every, morning the rooms in which
he made the plans for his expeditions. Say
what you may, produce .the ':-\u25a0. most ' con

invokes grace before each meal, "And,

prayer every day for these four â¢ years.
"Amen! Amen!" responds Fru Spanberff.

% Beautiful Crystallized Minerals. S
The collection contains many rare spe
cimens , not. generally found in a private
cabinet and embraces besides rich ores and
ornamental stones hundreds of attractive
and beautiful crystallized minerals from
different \ parts . of America and foreign
lands.
; San Francisco on receiving this gener
ous gift can boast of having the finest
collection of geodes on the Pacific Coast,
if not in the country. There are about
thirty specimens of these and no two
alike.
The collection is very rich in calcltes
of various forms and colors and fluorites
in groups of beautiful crystals in differ
ent shades of red. pink, purple, gTeen
yellow, white, etc.,' from different parts
of the world, the celebrated English fluors
being fully represented.
The group of quartz Is particularly in
teresting, there being many
crystallized specimens of various forms,
including quartz in phantom crystalsâ
these freaks of nature which show I a â¢
crystal within a crystal. There are fine
specimens of amethyst in crystallized and
massive form from Mexico and foreign
countries and beautiful hematites.
There is a splendid group of silver min
erals, n,ot merely ore-bearing rock, but at
tractive specimens rich in free wire silver.
. â¢ Other Rare Specimens.
Other specimens are the rare mineral
known to science as arguerite, a combi
nation of silver and quicksilver, found in
its natural state, and the very rare min
erals selenium, osmium, iridium-and plat
inum.
: Other specimens .that are most inter
esting are a mineral curio which resem
bles a fungous growth on a decaying tree,
known to the mineral world as bernardi
nite; a specimen which looks like a piece
of white leather is known to scientists
under the' name of .plllnite;' a "crystal of
halite (salt) contains several water bub
blesrthe water being Inclosed In cavities,
which can be seen to move as the speci
men Is shaken or vibrated.
â¢The collection numbers about 800 speci
mens and is valued by its former owner
at $10,000. It is deemed one of the finest
private cabinets in the State and about
thirty years' research was . necessary in
the forming of it. Mr. Braverman states
that he has received applications from
several Eastern institutions, as well as
two on this coast for his collection, but
has concluded that the general public will
derive greater benefit from it in the Park
Museum than elsewhere. ' \u25a0
'A magnificent addition to the mineral
exhibit in the Golden Gate Park Memo
rial Museum . has been made by Max
Braverman of Visalla. It comprises a col
lection of -minerals, embraced in ten
cases, and containing many rare speci
mens. The ten cases arrived on Satur
day and are now being. unpacked and re
corded. Work will then be commenced
on a series of labels, each one of. which
will be fully descriptive of the specimen
to which it is attached.'
Some idea of the : extent of' the collec
tion may be gained; from the fact that at
least several weeks' time will be required
in -the preparation and printing of the
labels alone. : In the meanwhile the col
lection : will be temporarily installed In
flat top cases and kept together In the
center of Mineral Hall,: so that the public
may have an opportunity of seeing it in
its entirety. Later it will be arranged in
systematic order in the general mineral
collection. . K ' \ .. . â¢ . .: â¢-

UNITED STATES ARMY TRANSPORT MEADE AS SHE APPEARED IN A GALE WHILE CROSSING v THE PA
CIFIC ON THE YOYAGE FROM MANILA TO THIS PORT, WHICH SHE HAS JUST COMPLETED, ARRIVING
IN SPLENDID CONDITION. " . . Â«
-The Meade brought np a number of cof
fuis containing the bodies of soldiers.
One of the boxes was labeled: "The re
mains of Corporal John A. Dolan, Com
piuir C, Thirty-seventh Infantry, cap
tured and starved to death by ladrones"
(robbers). It happened in Northern Lu
zon while Dolan was out with a scout
ing party. He was captured and carried
Into the fastnesses. Quite a number of
the marauders had been killed and the
remainder of the band took its revenge
by starving Dolan to death. His com
rades were hot on the trail of the rob
bers,-however, but it was months" before
the camp was discovered and the re
mains of noor Dolan, wasted to a skele
ton, recovered. They were brought to
Msinila and then shipped on the Meade to
San Francisco. %
The Meade brought over thirty pris
oners, nearly all of whom are sen
tenced for assaults upon native women.

It was expected that the men would be

are that they will be scattered all over

bor, where he served with the Third Ar
tillery several' years before being ordered

The United States Army transport
Meade arrived from the Philippines yes
terday. During the run across she ex
perienced some very heavy weather, and
tome of the men had a bad quarter of an
haur. Everything came out well in the
end, however, and Captain Wilson
brought his vessel into p<jrt in splendid
. \u25a0
Tne Meade brought over 960 soldiers and
a number of cabin uassengers. The tnen
are nearly all from the coast artillery.

A LARGE fleet, among which was
one overdue, made port yester
day. Among: the arrivals was the
army transport Meade, from the
Philippines; the British ships
Eracadale and Marion Frazer. from New
castle. Australia; the British ship
Chelmsford. from Hamburg, and the
overdue French bark Edouard Detaille,,
from Cardiff. , (
The Marion Frazer made the banner
run of the season, coming here from
Newcastle, N. S. W., in fifty-five days.
After crossing the equator she. secured
trade winds that brought her along at
steamship speed.
On the Bracadale; John Mannen," 68
years oX age, died from natural causes
znd was buried at sea.
The Chelmsford was 1G6 days coming
from Hamburg, and had a succession of
sales in the Atlantic, during which she
iost a number of sail. Friday and Sat
trday iast she rode out a heavy south
east gale, and the chances are that it is
the aftermath of that blow that made
things uncomfortable on the bay yester
day.
The Chelmsford was 166 days coming
from Hamburg, while the Edouard De
taille was 166 aays coming from Swansea.
On the latter vessel 10 per cent reinsur
ence was paid, however, and net a cent
on the Chelmsford. The reason probably <
was that the Detaille was coal-laden .and
the underwriters feared she had caugut
f.re.

ANOTHEB. WONDER OF SCIENCE.
Biology Has Proved That Dandruff Is
/' . ; Causejkby a" Germ.
\u25a0 Science is doing wonders these days In
medicine as well as in mechanics. Since
Adam delved, the human. race has been
troubled with dandruff, for which no hair
preparation has heretofore proved a suc-
cessful cure until Newbro's Herpicide
was put on/ the -market. It is a scientific
preparation that \u25a0 kills the germ that
makes dandruff or scurf by digging into
the scalp to get at' the root of the hair,
where it saps the vitality, causing itch-
ing scalp, falling hair and finally bald-
ness. Without dandruff, hair must . grow
luxuriantly. Herpicide at all druggists'.
It is the only destroyer of dandruff.

days before the vessel arrived Eng Go
died'and yesterday the two sons made ap

if he wanted to, but as he turned a deaf
ear to my entreaties. I intend to do like

As soon as Captain Scymo'jr learned of

Detective Coleman was instructed by
Captain Seymour to show the telegram

formed the detective that she did not in
tend to return to her husband.
Friday morning she "was picked up by
a policeman, who discovered her lying on

she was weak from hunger, she was sent
to the Receiving Hospital. Word was
sent to her husband iniorming him of her
pitiable plight, and yesterday he an
swered by saying that he would send a
railroad ticket to her providing she want
ed to rejoin him.
Despiro and his wife separated some

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 28.â Superior
Judge Hart this afternoon heard the con
fession of Thomas Hardy that he had
committed perjury and sentenced him to
one year's Imprisonment in . the' County
Jail. Hardy is one of several men arrest
ed by City Detective JVIax P. Fisher for
having illegally registered In order to
vote for Mayor next week. The records
of the County Clerk were produced, show
ing, that Hardy had registered in Sep
tember last and given his residence as the
Tremont Hotel.
Although Hardy claimed to have been
a resident of the city for ninety days prior
to registering Detective Fisher swore
that Haray had not resided here thirty
days. The officer said he first met Hardy
on September 8 and the latter told him he
had been in the city only three days.
Detective Fisher presented a signed
statement made by Hardy to the. effect
that he had never. resided in Sacramento
and had come here in the early part of
September.
Fisher claims to have found evidence* of
stuffing in seventeen cases in the First
"Ward. Chief of Police Sullivan declares
that he will vigorously prosecute all reg
ister stutters.
Halmeyer was a shoemaker. His do
mestic, happiness was shattered sometime
ago and the couple decided to forget all
conjugal bliss by separating.
Mrs. Halmeyer went to live with her
mother. 'at 18 Willow avenue, and there
the man who ended his life so dramatic
ally called frequently, to see his six chil
dren, aged from one- to ten years.
No particular attention was paid to his
visit to the house yesterday evening, but
when he informed his wife that he came
there to end his existence and made good
his threat by lifting a bottle of poison to
his mouth and swallowing the. contents,
the wife was panic stricken.
She rushed out of the house for assist
ance, leaving the children to watch the
father in his dying agonies. ' Â»
Then the Coroner's deputies were sum
moned to the Receiving . Hospital, and
relatives of the shoemaker who had
ended his life in such a tragic fashion
appeared upon the scene to express their
sorrow.
The desperate and despondent man; who
had been separated from his family, for a
few months, succumbed quickly to the
poison. The ambulance was called and
his body removed to the Receiving Hospi
tal. The doctors pronounced him dead;
"I'll drink this to show you that I love
you," eXclalmed Charles G. Halmeyer, as
he swallowed the contents of .a small bot

Mrs. H. S. Wagstaff, President Kansas*
City, Mo., Blue Ribbon Club, Tells Howj
She was Cured of Severe Bearing-Down 1
Pains, \ Backache, etc., by Lydia E._Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound.
" Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â After suffering for months with a
complication of female troubles, causing severe bearing-down pains
and backache, feeling constantly fatigued and unable to stand up
without great weariness, great relief came to me when a friend
advised me to use Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound,
which I did. It was worth more to me than all other medicines I ever*
tried, which only seemed to poison my system, while your Compound
healed me. I took your pills in connection, and they seemed to help
cast the poison and waste matter out of the system. I used the
Compound for six weeks and was then completely cured, and while
this was eighteen months ago I have had no relapse, but have en- j
joyed the best of health ever since. I wish that every poor dragged-
down, suffering woman might know that it would bring them health
to consult you and use Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound,
and I always do what I can to tell them of it." â Mrs. H. S. Wag-
staff, 1330 McGee St., Kansas City, Mo. |

'All the employes of the laundry were
at lunch when the fire broke out. " It Is
supposed- that lint, which sometimes ac
cumulates around the. pipes, ignited and
set fire to the clothes. .The woodwork
and clothes'were highly inflammable ow
ing to the constant heat and burned like
tinder. . . \u25a0 . .
â¢ Major Hooper says his loss will approxi
mate $1000. . Water ruined a great deal of
material on the : first floor and some of
the walls and floors were torn by the
firemen's axes in their effort to locate tho
flre. â¢ \u25a0
Three firemen were overcome by smoke
â Daugherty and Conlan of engine 2 and
Freeman of the fire patrol. Freeman was
caught In the basement and was brought
out of his perilous position through a hole
chopped in the sidewalk. .
When Chief Sullivan responded to the
first alarm the smoke was bo dense that
entrance to the basement where the fire
was burning was almost impossible. The
firemen were unable for many minutes
to determine the exact location of the
fire. Whether it was creeping up between
the walls, as was indicated by the smoke,
could not be told. The Chief, in a quan
dary as to the extent of the blaze, ordered
a second alarm rung in and the firemen
set to work with a will. Sections of the
barroom floor, were chopped out and'vol
umes of water directed into, the base
ment. : -. . â¢ .
Despite the efforts of the firemen, the
smoke thickened and the building became
almost completely enveloped. The Chief
then turned in a" third alarm, and an
other relay of engines' hurried to the flre.
A circulator was then set to work. This
piece, of serviceable apparatus had been
in use -but a short time when it reached
the blaze and the danger was pronounced
past. The room in which the flre started
was walled by brick, making It difficult
for the water to reach it. It contains the
steam pipes for drying the clothes. â¢
-Burned Like Tinder. \u25a0
Police Officers l Kd j Leonard, Tom . "Walsh
and- James \u25a0 Farrel were quickly on the
scene and rendered excellent service in
the' streets,' keeping the more excited off
the flre escapes and quelling any dem
onstration that would be likely -to lead to
a panic As soon as the flre was under
control t order- was restored, people re
turned to their apartments and the trunks
and other personal belongings that had
been â¢ dragged into the corridors were
taken back to their respective places. ,
The. odor of smoke, the clang of fire
apparatus and' the shouting from the
streets aroused the guests to act.on.
Many were at', lunch in the dining-room
and- they, rushed pellmell . into the lower
corridors. \u25a0 Those ; occupying rooms came
to windows and for a time appeared panic
stricken. â¢ Some shouted to spectators be
low, but i assurances. of safety were called
back. The hotelattaches displayed great
presence of mind and as quickly as possi
ble circulated' through the building, ex
plainlng-the location 'of the flames and
telling. of. the ample time for.escape In
the' event that the building should be
doomed. .- .

Fire broke out yesterday in. the drying
room of the Occidental- Hotel laundry.
Little damage was done, but for a time
intense excitement prevailed, on the
streets ' and jn the hotel. The excellent
service rendered by the Fire Department
prevented. great loss. Three alarms were
sent in by Chief Sullivan because of tha
menacing; .appearance of the blaze.
â¢â¢ It " was shortly after the noon hour
when : the fire was discovered. | ' Hundreds
of pedestrians were on their way in and
out of the business section. A. dense vol

of tm address delivered last evening be
fore a large audience at Metropolitan
Temple by Re\-. Peter C. Yorke at an en
tertainment given in aid of. the clergy
house of St. Peter's parish, of which
Father Casey is pastor.
D. F. Keefe presided, and a pleasing
proijramme was rendered by Miss Des
mond, the Knickerbocker Quartet, Miss
Annie Rooney and William Ogilvie.
The address cf Father Yorke was a de
fence of his attitude in the recent labor
strikes in this city and of the stand
tak'?n by a morning newspaper. An at
tack, extreme in its vituperation, was
made by Father Yorke on Colonel John
P. Irish, who had disagreed with the
speaker's views during the labor troubles,
and shafts of denunciation were hurled
at the newspapers that deprecated the
reign of terror existing during the strikes.
In defending the "freedom of the
preiis," Father Yorke said that the op
position to yellow Journalism following
the assassination of President McKinley
was the work of competitors of the saf
fror-hued periodicals. He characterized
the world-wide storm of condemnation as
an "attempt to cut off the freedom of the
preflB."

the ordinance limiting buildings on streets
less than 100 feet wide to 100 feet in
height. Reed contended that the permit
should be granted, as it was for a worthy
improvement, and that the board had al
ready granted similar privileges and
others that violated the charter, whereas
the De Young permit -was within the
province of the board. The ordinance wa3

tions of tonsorial artists. Shortly after
noon they repaired to, the Occidental Ho
tel tonsorial parlors, located on the Bush
street side of that caravansary.
Whether the. heat of the political de
bate, in which the legal men of diverse
political faiths indulged -while the
knights of the razor were lathering them
in the most approved fashion of the State
Board of Examiners caused the confla
gration in the drying-room is a question.
Fire Marshal Towe is investigating the
matter, for the drying-room, which
.caused... the scare and the. clanging of fire
noon about emulating the- hero
ism of the boy who stood on the burning
deck. â¢ '

and the Chief of Police and a temporary in

Court forbidding 'the Board of Public T Works

desire to prevent action until the matter is
tried in the courts, and that they will then
appeal to ( the Supreme' Court in case the or
dinance is decided valid. In. this manner
they will consume two or. three years in liti

seen fit to issue injunctions preventing- the Po

has been done in the case of Ingleslde track

The tonsorial artists tried to hold them,
but they broke into a run and were
greeted cheerfully at the door by" Mayor
Phelan. The Mayor, with coat collar
turned. up, wap watching the work of the
firemen, and he expressed great pleasure
that'\Mr. Riordan and Judge Conlan had
been saved from death. The legal gentle
men thanked him for his sympathetic re
gard, and removing the lather from their
faces with, their handkerchiefs proceeded
to another tonsorial parlor to have a final
and clean cut decision of ' the shaving
problem.' . . ' ' . "" . . :
The. men of the razor tried to assure
them that.it was not at all close in the
tonsorial parlors," and that they could
send them on their way looking' as hand
some as ever long before the marble floor
could be thrown against the ceiling by
the heat. Â»
The men of jurisprudence would heed
no such advice and with lather on their
faces and with only the port side of their
physiognomies cleared of stubble they
rushed for their coats and tiles.

NEW TORK. Oct. 28.â There was no very ag
gressive bull spirit manifest from the outset
In to-day's stock market, although there was
some support for special stocks from time to
time. About midday an attempt was made to
bid up a group of specialties, but the demand
lor Etocke ; was at a minimum and. prices kept
Bagging to . a lower level. The . pressure was
not severe through the earlier part of the day,
but gained ' force and In the last hour of the
session became acute. The realizing was by
recent speculative buyers, evidently, shown by
the conspicuous -weakness of those stocks which
have been under recent manipulation for the
advance. The weakness became quite general
at the last and the majority of the active
stocks fell a point or more below Saturday.
\u25a0The fall In Northwestern was 5%; Delaware &
Hudson. 4; St. Paul. 3%; Amalgamated Copper,
3V4: General Electric and Colorado Fuel, 3;
Sugar, 2%', New York Central. 2%; Union Pa
cific. 2% ; Missouri Pacific, Northern . Pacific
preferred. Baltimore & Ohio. Tennessee Coal
and Reading preferred, 2. The taking of bear
profits by the room traders caused only feeble
rallies and the closing was weak at about the
lowest. Undoubtedly the hardening tendency
of the money market and the prospect of gold
6hlpments to Paris this week prompted the
epeeulatlve liquidation. â¢ The clouds '\u25a0 of uncer
tainty which have gathered again over the
Northern Pacific settlement â¢ seemed' -to cast
gloom over the Epeeulatlve mind after Mr. Mor
gan had arrived at his office and no instan
taneous statement of settlement was given out.
The renewed weakness of ' Amalgamated Cop
per was also an unsettling influence. .The sell
ing of this stock and of Sugar was very heavy
for Boston, account. Call , loans advanced to
day to 4 per cent and the assurance which was
professed on Saturday over the "increased cash
reserves of the banks was dissipated and yield
ed to anxiety on account of the large loan ex
pansion. Foreign- exchange continued firm to-'
New York Stock Market.

class than the selling. There was general con

of shorts. , ; -
In this market there was no material change
in quotations, but the feeling was easy and
there was. a falling off in business on call.

starting . %c lower, at 71M>@71c. Report had
It that there had been good rains In Argentina
and at once there was a general liquidation,
not *only of large accounts, but also for short
sellers. The world's visible- supply had In
creased and world's -shipments had decreased
and there was an attempt to press the market
under 71c â¢ No sooner had the bull clique got
rid of their- wheat, however, than there came
reports that- the rain -was In ; provinces where
it was not needed. and December took a quick
upturn. It only reached 71%@71V4c,' however,
and when the pit showed signs of growing
dullness prices- eased oft again- to. 71c. De
cember closed weak, %(f^V4c lower, at 71%c.
Corn started weak because of the selling
pressure In wheat. Ibut turned up slightly as
soon as the other pit began to recover. De
cember closed easy, %c lower, 56%c. < -'-t
A fair cash demand kept the. oats pit fairly
firm and independent of ether markets. De
cember closed a shade lower, at 36%@36V4c. ;
"Hog products were ; profoundly dull, having
only enough business to establish quotations.
Prices opened lower on a *weaker hog market

Germany by to-morrow's steamers. In fact,
the discount rate at Berlin eased off a fraction
to-day and sterling exchange hardened, indi
cating a relaxation of th'e pressure at ' that
point There was no rally, however, In sterling
exchange at Paris and it is generally expected
that gold will go from New York to that point
on Thursday in considerable volume. . Call
money stiffened Bharply In London and open
market discount rates rose above the bank
rate, indicating an early advance by the bank.

back -to 25c discount, while shipments to New
Orleans from here continue. The optimists

But the analogy of the fall of 1898 and the evi
dent break of the Boer war is fresh In mind
when the call loan rate on the Stock Exchange
advanced to 186 per cent without / preventing
the current export movement of "gold. The
dally surplus of the Government revenue is also
rapidly augmenting in the latter part of the
month, making an additional drain on the
money market.

MANCHESTER, Oct 28.â The Guardian
prints a letter, dated August 15, written
by Steyn, ex-President of â¢ the Orange
Free State, to .General Lord Kitchener,
commanding the British forces in South
Africa, discussing the military situation.
The letter] is too long to quote textually,'
but in It Steyn says In the Free State
"order and peace are' maintained by us,
and not by your Excellency. If your Ex
cellency will permit me, your Excellency's
jurisdiction extends only as far as your
Excellency's cannon can reach. If It .Is
a crime to- fight in . self-defense, and ' if
such crime must be punished, then I think
his Majesty's Government, ought to be
satisfied -with the destruction ot the coun
try, the chastisement of women and chil
dren, arid the general misery which has
been caused by this war." ...
Steyn deals with the misery of the con
centration camps. He states th@.t a great
majority of the fighting Boers are stllL
in arms, and gives it as his opinion it is
in Kitchener's power more, than that of
any other man to make an end" of the
war. He concludes- by declaring the Boers
ask for no magnanimity, but only demand
justice. .V- -\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'.

er Hay, that magnificent liar, and hfs
wife. In the part of Tennessee Kent,
Agnes Ranken achieved an unqualified
success. She is a bright, clever girl and
was the life and soul of the piece. There
was nothing overdone in her. rendition of
the part, which was portrayed with,life
like fidelity and ingenuousness. M. L. Al
sop as Caleb Swan, the "legitimate and
high-toned card player,"' was admirable,
and Howard Scott was, as usual, excellent
as Asa Bice, the "pardner." Frank Bacon
was simply immense as Gewilliker Hay
and made a decided hit. He seems to revel
in the part. The other characters were
ably sustained by Miss Lillian Elliott, as
Nettie Bice;. Miss Marie Howe, as Mrs.
Hay; Paul Gerson, as Tom Romaine;
Barton Hill, as Spike, and Carlyle Moore,
as Amos Barlow. The piece is well staged.

The claim grows out of mining ventures
in which both men and other St. Louis
people are interested. Chartrand claims
that he "grub-staked" certain properties
which Shotwell has worked to the extent
of $22,00), and it is this amount, together
with the profits that he might have made,
that he seeks to recover. Shotwell is re
ported to be wealthy and is well-known
in mining circles both in Arizona and
Colorado.

OAKLAND, Oct. 2S.-Judge Stetson, City
Justice of the Peace; Is out 50 cents. Ha
married OweivP. Mellen of Akron, Ohio,
to an Oaklana girl to-day in his ,court
ropm and when the nuptial knot had been
drawn good and tight the bridegroom
asked him how much it was.
"Three dollars!" '
"Haven't got it!" exclaimed the bride
groom. "Only got two and a half."
J'Well, that's what the code allows us
to' charge."
"Seems to me you charge an awful lot
to marry a feller out here. Back in Ohio
they only charge $1 50. Why, I could have
got a minister to do it for nothing."
Finally Judge Stetson accepted the J2 50.
As he is a salaried officer and turns in
all his fees he will have to die down,
unless the. bridegroom shows up and pro
vides enough to make. up the full $3, tee

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 28.â
Strenuous efforts are being' made to have
Stanford represented at the intercollegi

and. \u25a0 best organized force of "rooters'*
that has ever represented the cardinal.
Six hundred seats for: the game, to bo
sold to "rooters" only, will be placed on
sale in the N campus Thursday, and it is
expected that every. one will be occupied
the day of the game by a Stanford man
with a red hat and leathern lungs. Four
hundred "rooters' hats" of red cloth, have
been ordered by students trl> to the .'pres
ent date and 200 more will'be ordered be
fore the game: An effort is being made
to have'Sanford alumni in San Franciso

LONDON, Oct. 2S.-The pertinacity with
which society discusses the rumors N re
garding the health of King Edward has
had a serious effect on tne 'court dress
makers, who expected <o have been ere
now busily engaged on the eourt dresses.
They are keeping large | staffs in almost
complete idleness. .The members of so
ciety have apparently made up their
minds that they will not go to any ex
pense until they are sure that the cor
onation will really occur. There is a very
clearly defined impression in the diplo
matic corps Uiat the King is threatened
with some organic corrfplaint.' Some go
so far as' to say it Is cancer, or Bright's
disease, cr both: Probably. the truer so
lution is that th.c cancer rumor springs
from \u25a0 the King's oft-expressed dread of
cancer, which has made such ravages in
his own family, and that whatever ail
ment may threaten him it has , ; not
reached any definite cr dangerous stage,
else he would be quite unable to keep
up" his incessant round* of public duties
and private pastimes with the regularity
and zest which - he continues to display.
In spite. of these tacts, there is undoubt
edly a very alarming premonition in court
circles, especially among women;. that the
King will never live to be crowned,
which, however .baseless, is having seri
ous eifect on trade. The favorite story
in this connection now current is thnt a
palmist told i^ueon Alexandra not long
ugo that she would never live to be
crowned.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28.-The incoming
mail, from the East has brought to the
Navy Department a number of Chinese
newspapers which contain the news o*
what is termed an "outrage" upon an
American .citizen, andalso a British citi
zen, employed by the lumber firm of Bush
Bros, at Niuchwang. It is said that these
two men, whose names \ are not given,
were arrested illegally and threatened
with loaded rifles and bayonets by a, : party
of Cossacks outside the Russian lines at
Niuchwang on the 12th of August last, an-i
that both the British and the American
Consuls at Niuchwang have been making
vigorous representations upon the sub
ject.
The State Department has received from
Minister Conger at Peking a translation
of a series . of preliminary- regulations
adopted by the recently organized Chi
nese ..board of national administration,
charged with the reorganization of that
Government on modern and efficient lines.
The sentiments ! expressed- are conserva
tive, .says Conger, and it is made plain
that there is , no intention to imitate the
too brisk pace set by the reformers of
1898, but instead to study Western meth
ods, and, without' adopting' Western civ
ilization as a whole, to' adapt to Chinese
conditions such institutions as seem, likely
to add strength to the state. ~.:\ V \u25a0\u25a0.
Finally the whole matter was left in
the hands of President Marston and Town
Attorney Havne.
. Some discussion -was provoked over the
final clause of the resolution, which pro
vided that the Town Trustees waived all
right to declare forfeited the franchise
for failure to run the trains at least once
In six months. However, the board was
about to accept the proposition when
Trustee Staats suggested looking up tha
old franchise ordinance and its production
developed the. fact that that document
contained a clause fixing a penalty of
$5000 for non-conformity to the conditions.
Staats discovered that a bond for $5000
had been put up years ago by the railroad
company as an assurance of good faith
and he* wanted the board to make an
effort to get at the subscribers to the in
strument."
BERKELEY, Oct. 28.â Attorney A. E.
Bolton appeared before the Town Trustees
to-night and offered the members induce
ments to rescind its action of last week
in declaring forfeited the franchise of the
California and Nevada Railroad for non
payment of taxes. Attorney Bolton, who
represents the receiver for the road, ten
dered* a check for $993 97 in payment of
the delinquent taxes fc for the last five
years and also effsred a resolution for the
board's consideration undoing the work of
last week. ' .

Naval Cadet Noa was appointed from
Tennessee and entered the Annapolis
Academy in September, 1S96. After his
graduation in June of 1900 he went to the
Philippines in the performance of the
required two years' service abroad and
was one of the two officers aboard the
email gunbeat Mariveles which has been
doing patrol duty among the smaller
Islands of the Philippine group.
It developed to-day that Naval Cadet
Ivoveman Noa, who lost his life near
Nipa-Nipa, Samar. was killed by natives
while on a boat expedition. Rear Admiral
Rodg-ersi in his dispatch announcing the
death of Noa, gave no other casualties.
Rodgrers' cablegram follows:
"Naval Cadet Loveman Noa, while on
shore near Nipa-Nipa, Samar, on boat ex
pedition, was killed by natives October

TOPEKA, Kans., Oct. 28.â Hugh Wal
lace, aged 35 years, was shot and fatally
wounded by his aged father to-day. The
elder Wallace went to Oklahoma at the
time of the opening and persuaded his
son to go down and try for a claim. Not
drawing any, young- Wallace returned to
Topeka after spending quite a sum of
money. This caused bad feeling between
the men and the tragedy resulted.
Aged Father Shoots His Son.
The only reference of general Interest
was the promise that measures should
shortly be submittted to finally complete
the reform of the-currency.
BUDAPEST, Oct. 28.â "A close under
standing with the allies of the empire
and : continued ' friendly relations with all
the powers, permits us to hope that Piov
idence will not deprive U3 of the blessings
of peace."
"With the exception of remarks regard
ing commercial treaties, ' the above con
stituted. Emperor .Francis Joseph's sola
reference to international affairs when he
personally opened the newly elected Hun
garian Diet to-day. The speech from the
throne dwelt upon the necessity for com
prehensive legislation in all fields, in or
der to raise the standard cf intellectual
and material development, and for a per
manent settlement on a reciprocal basis
of .the economic questions pending in dif
ferent parts of the monarchy.
"With a view to the preparation of in
ternational commercial treaties, â¢which
are of decisive importance to the whale
economic system," said the Emperor, "a
rearrangement of the general customs
tariff on the lines of the law of lSs9,
Is above all necessary, extending: equal
and harmonious protection to every
branch of production and agricultural
and Industrial Interest?." Â»
Hopes for the Continuance of
the Great Blessings of
Peace.

THE ladies and gentlemen con
nected with Sacred Heart parish
will produce the pretty comic
opera, "The Doctor of Alcantara,"
"A Billionaire" was written by Peter
Robertson, a Bohemian Club man. There
are eight characters in the sketch, and
the text Is said to be bubbling over with
witty lines and clever situations.
Orrin Peck will play the part of a girl,
fair and only 17 and full of wisdom. Dr.
J. Wilson Shiels is the billionaire, who in
the development of the play is discovered
to be a fakerâ a "billoinaire" in his mind
only. J. C. Wilson runs through the play
as an "oil boomer"; Charles : Dickman is
Snapps, an artist; Dick Hotallng will play
the part of a tramp, and Beverly Letcher
a servant. There is "also a "policeman"
in the cast, but his identity off the stage
has not yet been disclosed.
The clubmen are having frequent re
hearsals, and those who have been priv
ileged to attend them declare that in this
sketch they are going to surpass even the
splendid record they have .previously es
tablished.
Unusual interest is being manifested in
the skit, "A Billionaire," in which' the
Bohemian Club men will appear. The
talent and versatility of the brilliant club
men are a well established fact, but the
public has never been allowed to revel in
it The Bohemian heretofore . has sung
and played and danced and quipped his
jokes to the delight and. for the delight of
his fellow clubmen only. The doll show
will be the first time that Bohemian talent
may be seen and enjoyed outside the'sa
cred precincts of Bohemian Clubdom.

Thirty ladies enjoyed a delightful after

Apropos of golfing, news comes via New
York that the Brookline Country Club,
which has an excellent 18-hole course, is
preparing to make a strong bid for the
women's national championship next year.
The excellent showing of the Boston
women on the New Jersey links, although
disappointed in not winning the leading
honor, will be used as a strong argument
in favor of the move. The qualifying six
teen included seven members of clubs In
or near Boston, and they also showed up
well in the consolation set. Miss Elizabeth
Porter of the Oakley Club winning the
cup. The Brookline Club has always
taken a prominent part in the encourage
ment of women's golf, and holds an open
tournament for the fair players every
year.
SMALL and altogether exclusive
will be the meetings of the Fri
day Fortnlghtlys this winter. The
dancing class will meet six times
and the opening cotillon will be
held on the evening of November 22. As
usual, the meetings will take place at
Cotillon Hall and are to "be characterized
by the Eame delightful - informality and
early hours that made the Fortnlghtlys
to vastly popular during last winter. The
Christmas meeting, as has # heretofore been
the custom, will be an army and navy
cotillon.
At the first cotillon nearly all the de
