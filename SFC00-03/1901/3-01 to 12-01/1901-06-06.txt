number of. men doing duty in the out

'lleved in military circles that the experts
favor the subdivision of the islands into
districts and the establishment therein of
garrisons, thus rendering It possible for
a â¢ lesser number of men to control tha
natives. Such a plan would greatly re
duce the expense of military operations.
It is also believed that the visIJIng offi

use of army provender and that the cor

FINISH OF THE DERBY.
Although Volodyovski Is owned and
trained by", Americans, he is an Erigish
bred colt, being by the King's horse Florl
zeli II out of La Reine! He was bred by
Lady Meux, and , leased by her' to the late
Lord William Beresford. At the death of
Lord' William .his executors held the opin
ion that the lease of the colt did not lapsed
but 'Lady Meux took a contrary- view.
Litigation ensued and the colt was re
turned'to .his breeder. Subsequently he
was leased to Mr. Whitney. -But for the

Volodyovski's victory was very popular,
and his success has taken a lot of money
out of the ring. "He was cheered aÂ§raln

. There was some delay at the start, but
eventually an excellent one was eff ected
and Foxhall Keene's Jockey, Henry, on
Olympian, got away like a shot from a
gun. He set a cracking pace and before
Tattenham Corner * was reached- had
spread-eagled his field. As they rounded
and came into the straight it was. seen
that Volodyovskl was right -there, run
ning with great resolution. A tremen
dous roar went up when it was seen that
he had got on even terms a quarter of a
mile. from home, coming along at a rare
clip, with William III In hot pursuit.

LOrCDOX, June 5. â The race for the
Derby, the blue ribbon of the
English turf, run at Epsom to
day, resulted "In an easy victory
for the 5 to 2 favorite, William
C. Whitney's Volodyovskl, whom Lester
Relff steered hone three-quarters of a
length In front of the Duke of Portland's
William III. Douglass Baird's Veronez, a
40 to 1 chance, was third, four lengths
away, and the French Jockey, Watkins. on
Floriform. Just missed the place by a
head. Thus for the fourth time In the his
tory of the Derby it has been won by a
foreigner. Once before, in 1S81. the race
was won by a citizen of the United States.
Pierre Lorillard. In that instance the
jockey, Fred Archer, was an Englishman.
To-day was the first occasion on which an
American horseman proved successful.
The day appeared to have been made for
the occasion. One glarce at the white
flecked clouds In the dome of blue forbade
the thought of umbrellas or waterproofs,
and the pretty dresses of the many ladies
on coaches, or the flaring colors of less
fortunate members of their sex who trav

the chief surgeon to request his selection

The .". departure of Colonel ".. Forwood is
deeply regretted by the hosts of friends
he has made since his 'connection with
the -Department- of California. % He ; has
been on j duty here since December, 1838,
and his courteous treatment of every, one
visiting headquarters has made" him most
popular. Colonel Forwood Is to ,be~ con

His selection to temporarily fill the posi

of his merits as a surgeon and* an ac

Praise for Generous Hosts.
Mr. Jessup, : president of the Chamber
of Commerce, , replying to the address of
welcome, spoke in part as follows:
All those who, like myself, are servants of
the public feel that they hold an unwritten
commlssloln that no pains shall be spared to
maintain the most friendly relations. "With re
gard to President McKinley, we think of the
great efflce he fills and, in addition to his
public cares, we remember the burden of pri
vate anxiety he lias to bear, and it Is the
prayer of our whole country that his wife may
be restored to health and that he may con
tinue to t>J to the whole world a potent Influ
ence for ' the cood of the human race.
I imagine that this honorable duty has been
assigned to me because I am connected with
the Department of Foreign Affairs and be
cause it may be that a toast, coming from my
lips, may seem to denote something more than
a mere private expression of admiration and
rcoi will. I think I may say that to all the
subjects of his Majesty it requires an effort
to think of our relation with the United States
as foreign relations. (Prolonged cheers.)
There was a' murmur of expectancy as
Lord Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary,
rose to toast President McKinley. He
said:
To no other nation are wÂ» drawn as we are
to our kinsmen across the Atlantic The wise
ly directed friendship of our two peoplesâ not
as yet, and perhaps never to be, cemented by
formal allianceâ should be a potent influence.
Working together for the common good of all
mankind, we may keep open the door for
trade, we rr.ay spread civilization, we may
protect the oppressed, and we may establish
pÂ»ace amongr the nations. Â«
Grocers' Hall, Just opposite the Bank of
England, has the reputation of being the
most Interesting 'chamber of all city com
panies. The tables to-night were deco
rated with a profusion of flowers and his-'
toric plate. Around the hall is a gallery ;
which, as the evening advanced, was filled
with ladles, who attended to hear the
speeches.

Associated Chambers of Commerce), and
J. Pierpont Morgan were among those
seated at the table of honor. In all near

â¢ WASHINGTON. June 5.â For the first

President and her physicians to-day felt
encouraged over her condition. She is so
weak and worn by disease that they are
almost afraid to hope and the bulletin is
feued by Secretary Cortelyou at 11 o'clock
this morning, after thÂ« consultation of
doctors, was of a tone less optimistic than
Was warranted by the state of Mrs. Mc-
Kinley's health. The bulletin was: "Mrs
McKJnleys physicians report that she has
had a very comfortable night and that
her general condition Is somewhat im
proved."
. This Improved condition has continued
throughout the day and eveninr. Mrs
McKinley is now sleeping naturally and if
this situation continues until to-morrow
It is believed that the physicians will be
9ble to report that there is hope of her
ultimate recovery. The warm weather
has had a beneficial effect. Mrs. McKin

UKIAH. June 5.â The town of Willits,
twenty-four miles north of Ukiah, was
practically destroyed by fire this after
noon. The fire started, in a blacksmith
shop in the northern part of town, and,
urged bya brisk wind,,- it was soon com-,
muuicated-to other buildings*. There be
ing no waterworks or lire apparatus,
nothing could be done to stay the ad
vance of the flames.
Three hotelsâ the Palace, the Little,
Lake and the Occidental;- three livery,
stabies, several stores and saloons, shops,
etc., were soon destroyed. In fact, the
only business buildings left standing were
Irvine & Muir's brick store, the Odd Fel
lows' building and one or two stores.
Nine or ten residences were burned.
Quite a number of- houses were new and
some of -them uncompleted. . Willits has
enjoyed a substantial boom for several
months, as it is soon to be the terminus
of the California Northwestern Railway.
Buildings have . been going up on. every
hand and the town has been crowded with
people. The losses are, very heavy ' and
the. insurance light. Many new stores had
recently been opened, several Ukiah mer
chants having established branches there.
The fire will be quite a backset to. the
town temporarily, as it was difficult to
procure lumber for the buildings already
under way. Rebuilding will- begin soon
and progress as rapidly as possibly. The
railroad extension will reach Willits
about September and it is expected the
town will continue to grow.
The following is a -list' of the-- losses so

Lyons had prepared his charges in writ
ten form and attested them before a No
tary Public, He announced his intention
of going before the Commissioners and
reading them at all hazards. The charges
were that the guardian had attempted to
make improper advances to the wife of
the complainant and had threatened the
complainant with loss of employment if
he made trouble. Efforts to get the wo
man out of the valley upon various pre
texts before the meeting of the Commis
sioners were alleged.
But Lyons did not present the charges,
despite all of his threats, and the Yo
semite Valley was spared its first scan
dal.
The annual " meeting , brought forth
nothing of moment except Â¦ this burst
sensation. I Governor Gage did not attend
and Commissioners Kirkpatrick and Met
son and Clinch were absent. Those pres
ent were Vice President William G. Hen
shaw, W. W. Foote, Charles S. Glvens,
Frank H. Short and William G. Kerck
hoff. William G. Henshaw was re-elected
vice president and J. J. Lermen was re
elected secretary. , .. . .,
Besides granting all of the' old conces
sions the only business of importance was
the decision reached to expend all of the
llarlposa big tree grove fund- in the
grove at Wawona at. once. .This fund has
been allowed to accumulate of late. C. L.
Cory, who was instructed to prepare
plans for the proposed electric light
plant, for Â¦which a special appropriation
was made by the last Legislature, ' re
ported a general plan, to include a power
station below Vernal Falls, a system I of
wires for the valley and a searchlight to
be thrown across the valley upon â¢ Yo
semite Falls. This matter will be finally
settled at a future meeting to be held -in
San Francisco. Governor Gage will be
conferred with upon this, as he Is much
interested in the plan. ' . * i
For several days it has been open gos
sip that W. F. Lyons, who resides at the
Eleven Mile Station, would prefer
charges of a very serious nature 1 against
Guardian John F. Stevens. So far did it
go that Lyons left his position two days
ago and came into the Yosemite Valley,
so as to be before the Commissioners.
He announced â¢ to many that he would
prefer written charges against Stevens,
affecting the attitude of the guardian
toward the wife of the man who was
making the complaint. Lyons told nearly
everybody in the Yosemite Valley that he
intended to bring an accusation of im
morality against the guardian and that
he would appear before the Commission
ers himself in support of it. But as the
meeting of the Commissioners drew near
Lyons' attitude changed.
The first session of the commission was
held thfe morning. Commissioner Frank
H. Short of Fresno asked that the elec
tion of officers go over until evening, giv
ing as his reason that certain matters
"which might cause trouble" could prob
ably be disposed of if the election were
postponed. Upon his suggestion the elec
tion was carried over until this evening,
and the regular concessions were all
granted as for last year.
During the afternoon when some of the
Commissioners were inspecting the pro
posed site of the new electric light plant
there "were several conferences with Lyons.
The result of these conferences was seen
at the meeting to-night, when Lyons'
charges were not presented and Guardian
Stevens was re-elected by a unanimous
vote.
YOSEMITE, June 6.â The sensation that
was expected to break at the annual
meeting of the Yosemite Valley Commis
sioners did not materialize to-night. The
old officials were re-elected without op
position and the charges that have been
talked about against Guardian John F.
Stevens were not presented.

CLOUD OF VAPOR
Mare Island Explosion
Costs Uncle Sam
$600,000.
More Than Three Hundred
Tons of Smokeless Pow
der is Burned.
The smokeless powder was stored in
copper tanks and there was no possibility
of a. spark from the outside igniting it.
The greatest precautions are taken in
the handling of the powder and the ar
rangement of the magazine and no
chances are taken with the deadly stuff.
No iron is allowed on floor or on walls,
no Iron- tools are permitted, and when a
hammer is necessary a copper one or a
malle* is used. Even the men who enter
must put on Ions robes and change their
shoes for wooden sandals. All these pre
cautions are enforced in the magazines
of the navy on shore as well as on ship
board, and powder is handled as tenderly
as Venetian elass. . ..
The explosion was a peculiar one in
many ways. Smokeless powder may be
ignited in the open air and it will burn
plowly with a fizz and a sputter, but
Â¦when confined even in the slightest de
cree it bursts all restraint and thunders
through everything in its way. it was
believed that the flimsy roof over the
magazine- might cause pressure enough
to madden the forces of the burning pow
der, but it seems it did not. The roof
was made as flimsy aa possible for just
that purpose, but the powder was not be-
Heved to be as tame as it was. It simply
lifted the roof and then burned between
/the walls, slowly for powder, but rapidly
.enough to finish the Job it was at The
cloud that arose after the explosion was
Yiot smoke, but a thin vapor, and it took
the form of pmoke because there was so
much of it. It is not often that 325 tons
'of powder are allowed to . burn - all at
once. The vapor disappeared in a few
moments and the magazine walls and
some burning grass were all that told of
the explosion. *
The total loss will probably reach $500,
000. â¢
Explosion a Peculiar One.
An eye-witness of the explosion says
the column of vapor stood up from the
site of the magazine like a tremendous
balloon, and, as he stood on the Vallejo
side of the channel, he could see flashes
flame cutting through the column from
base to crest. He felt no shock and
heard no noise, and he believes he was
led to look in the direction of the maga
zine by the first flash of the explosion.
That the explosion occurred so early in
the morning accounts for the fact that
there were no lives lost. After 8 o'clock
from fifteen to twenty men are continu
ally at work in the vicinity of the maga
zine and sometimes inside of it. Had the
explosion been delayed two hours and a
half it is certain that some of these men
would have been killed.
The fire alarm was quickly turned in
and from the Alert, the Philadelphia, the
Independence and the marine barracks
poured hundreds of men, all organized
into tire brigades and ready for duty.
Commander Thomas Phelps, commander
of the Alert, took charge of the fire bri
gade and he soon had the men at work
controlling the flames that were consum
ing what was left of the magazine and
the grass on the hillside near it. They
were fearful that the blaze would spread
to the black powder magazine and knowl
edge of what would happen did it get
that far lent strength to their energy.
The yard tug Unadilla and a corps of
jmen from the department of yards and
docks assisted and within a few hours
the fire was quenched.
Near the wharf and but a hundred
yards away from, the explosion is the
shell house, and near to that Is the
packing house where the shells are charg
ed. . Neither of them was injured in the
least. And within 500 feet of the smoke
less powder magazine stands another in
which Is stored 800,000 pounds of black
powder, and this was not touched. Had
the black powder been ignited it would
have exploded in the old fashioned way,
and there is not a house lor miles around
but would have felt the shock. Buildings
on the island would have been wrecked,
the whole powder station demolished and
the town of Vallejo shaken as fcy an
earthquake.
Black Powder Not Ignited.

der flew skyward at 6 o'clock Â£hls morn-
Ing from the magazine ' at " the end of
Mare Island, snd formed a column of
white 1500 feet high. There was no shock
and no noise; no men were killed or in
jured and very little property, was de
stroyed; but in the space of a few seconds
$580,000 worth of powder had eaten itself
up and the people in the town of Vallejo,
not a half mile across the strait, had not
been jarred into a knowledge of what had
happened.
No one knows what caused the explo
sion. It is attributed â¢ to gases which
formed from the powder and was ignited
in one of the mysterious ways that make
explosions so much of a puzzle. There
was a watchman on duty, but he was not
near enough to the scene to know of
what happened just before the powder
ignited, and while a board of officers will
be appointed to investigate, it is not prob
able that any explanation will be found.
The remarkable feature of the explo
sion is the small damage done. The new
smokeless powder used by the navy is a
composition in which guncotton figures
largely, and the composition is one hav
ing tremendous power when ignited un
der certain conditions. There were other
conditions present to-day, however, for
all the damage done was to the magazine
in which- the powder* was stored. The
walls of the magazine were of brick and
the roof was a light one of metal. When
the powder was ignited it tore the roof
from the walls and sent the fragments
flying just as a cyclone might have done,
and then the powder burned itself out
without doing any more damage. Just
over the ridge from the burning maga
zine was the house in which Gunner Hal
ford, who is in charge of the magazine,
lives with his family. His house was not
damaged, but his wife and children were
so frightened they ran out of the build
ing and took lefuge farther over the
ridge.

REDDING, June 5.â George C. Carson, a
mining man of experience In Northern
California and recently employed as su
perintendent of. the Boulder mine in the
Echo Lake district, has Invented a pro
cess for . the manufacture " of steel. It
consists of a carbon blowpipe, through
the operation of which pigirqn may be
converted into steel as it leaves Â¦ the
cupola furnace. Mr. Carson has taken
advantage of several chemical properties,
a technical recital of which would only be
wearisome to the average' mind, and Â¦ by
their operation has produced a plan for
the manufacture of steel which is claimed'
to bo far ahead of the Bessemer process.
Mr. Carson has been ! several years in
perfecting his â¢ invention. . As . soon as his
patents were applied -for; he' was ap
proached by a person whom he will Â¦ not
name, but whom he believes to represent

process. The terms of the offer were that
he .would be given that immense sum for
absolute control of his patents, providing
they were issued and the process /proved
anything like what is claimed for it. To
test the plan -the agent offered to con
struct a plant near. Chicago. The entire
offer has been Â¦ accepted by. the Inventor

NEW YORK. June 5.â The liauor tax
certificate held by J. J. Corbett. the
pugilist, was revoked to-day by Justice
Kreedman of the Supreme Court on con
sidering the report of Alfred Page as
referee in a proceeding brought for the re
vocation of the license by the Rev. J. Q.
A. Henry, superintendent of the New York
Anti-Saloon t^eague^
Corbett Loses His License.
.The sentences were on account of an af
fidavit which, the attorneys attempted to
read and file in Humpreys' court to show,
on motion for a change - of venue, the
Judge's: alleged personal bias. against Edi
tor Smith of the Advertiser, who was In
dicted by the Grand Jury for perjury. In
the storm raised by. these proceedings the
Grand Jury's investigations of the bribery
charges have been lost sight of, but the
jury is still in session and is believed to be
getting close to some bribery cases. l
The affidavit, of which the introduction
was adjudged to be contempt, was sworn
to by Smith and presented in , court by
Hartwell, Kinney and . Ballou, Kinney
reading it to the Judge. "â¢ It purported to
relate facts showing the personal relations
of Smith and the Judge and told of offers
the latter made to Smith of a position as
editor: of the Honolulu Republican, in
which Humphreys is a stockholder, which
offers were rejected.
When the attorney reached a statement
that the defendant's relations with the
Judge had enabled him to become ac
quainted with his "inordinate ambitions
and his "personal weaknesses," the court
Interrupted the reading and ordered the
three attorneys who offered the document
to answer for contempt. After â¢ hearing
their cases he ruled that the document
had been filed for the purpose or bringing
into the case extraneous matters, slan
derous and false and of a political nature,
with a view to impeding and obstructing
justice and bringing the court into con
tempt and. he sentenced each of the at
torneys to thirty days in jail. '.
Hartwell was formerly representative of
the Hawaiian Government at Washington
and Is a veteran attorney â¢ of Hawaii,
and the others, with him, have long been
prominent in island affairs. % â¢ '_ â¢ â¢-
Acting Governor "Coopers pardons
reeached the High Sheriff before the at
torneys had been placed' in jail and they
were released. Cooper's act is denounced
on the one hand as executive Interference
with the judiciary and as destructive â¢ of
the power of the tlrst Circuit Court to en
force its processes, and en the other hand
it is warmly commended as releasing
three highly respected lawyers. from what
is claimed was an unreasonable sentence.
Local Eentiment runs high and the af
fair Is generally regarded as a political
row. The Star and the Advertiser bitter
ly assail Judge Humphreys as a politician
on the bench and denounce his sentence as
having been the result of personal vlndic
tiveness, while the Bulletin and the Re
publican as vigorously defend his course
and attack Cooper, declaring that his par
dons were for members of the "missionary
ring." -The. "Advertiser says that the
Grand Jury Is packed for political ends
and" it has published- an affidavit, signed
by its business manager, A. W. Pearson,
saying that Oscar Lewis, bailiff of Hum
phreys' court, who is. well, known, as a
shipping master in many Pacific Coast
ports, offered to "pack" a trial jury for
the Smith perjury case in consideration of
being assisted to gefa license for a water
front saloon. This publication was fol
lowed by Humphreys calling for' Lewis'
resignation as bailiff.. ef.
The foundation for the reports of brib
ery in the Legislature has suddenly been
revealed by Jacob Coerper. a man who
wanted a railroad franchise and -who is
the client whose name L. A. Thurston
refused to reveal to the Grand Jury.

DEMAND OUSTING
OF THE JUDGE
Coulter tried to reply, but the audience
hooted him down. The President' then
declared all discussion out of order and
ordered that balloting be proceeded with.
The count of the ballots showed 1659
votes cast. 181 short of the number, and
an adjournment was. taken until to-mor
row. From the expression of to-day's
meeting it is certain Bond and the old
board of directors will be re-elected. The
opposition* ticket, headed by J. H. Henry,
will receive but few votes. . Â¦
When Bond finished reading, the report
was received. Election officers were ap
pointed and a recess taken until 1:30
o'clock. At the opening of the afternoon
session Major "W. A. Coulter precipitated
a hot discussion by asking a number of
questions of President Bond, which turn
ed out to be arguments against .the re
election of the president and board of di
rectors. I$e asked Judge Bond what he
meant by arraigning all the growers In
his report when he charged that they
sold their prunes to outside packers.
Coulter's questions were such as to show
he was opposed to Bond's administration.
The meeting was thrown into excite
ment and there were cries of "Sit Down,"
"Hurrah for Bond" and "Put him out."
President Bond then took the floor. He
accused Coulter of trying to wreck the
association and declared he had been
working to that end for months and had
boasted that unless the association dis
banded at this meeting he would take
steps that would put it out of existence.
"In the first place, I did not arraign the
growers for selling their prunes outside
of the association," he said. "I said that
there was a certain percentage of them
who had sold their prunes outside of the
association, and I made the statement on
the information given me by the outside
packers themselves. If outside packers
bought all the prunes not pledged to the
association they could have got only 22,
000,000 pounds. In fact, they got 50,000,000.
This is sufficient answer as to where they
got them." . â¢;.-.-,'

The result of the present method of market

proves that it has not increased the consump

Judicious advertising of goods with the asocla

such a course. Even the experience you have

more fruit than was ever rrown before. More

is but one way by which the organization can

reason why sales were not made at satisfac
tory prices was the unprecdented crops of fruit
of all kinds In this country and In Europe.
There was an overproduction of fruit every
where. Every fruit that could compete with
the prune was offered in every market as a
substitute and at low prices.
It "was a mistake that the basis price was
made 3 cents Instead of 2*4 or 2%; It was a
mistake, as we now know, that when the out

President Bond's Report.
SAH JOSE, June 5.â The annual meet
ing of the California Cured Fruit Asso
ciation to-day was attended "by about 800
prune growers, and these showed that
they were unanimously for President
Bond and his policy. They applauded his
remarks and refused to allow any ad
verse criticism. This change of heart on
the part of the growers was .^surprising,
for a few months ago they iiad nothing
but condemnation for Bond and. the direc
tors. The object of to-day's meeting, the
election of officers and changes in the
by-laws, failed for lack of a auorum, and
an. adjournment was taken until to-mor
row afternoon. One-half.of the members
of the association is a*quorum. With
about 800 ballots that had been sent In by
mall, the attendance lacked about 200 of
the requisite number.
Judge Bond called the meeting to order
at 10 o'clock. The auditorium was well
filled. On the stage beside the presiding
officer was the board of directors. Presi
dent Bond at once read his report. At
frequent intervals it was applauded.

MACOK". Mo., June 5.â James Stacey, an
engineer aged El years, living ten miles
east of here on the Burlington road, to
cay. in a fit of mental aberration, killed
his wife and daughter, aged 18 years, and
then, after relating the fact to a neighbor,
shot himself to death. James, an eight
year-old son. was spared. The tragedy
occurred early this morning when the vic
tims were asleep. -Â»--
Stacey, who for the past thirty years
has been a trusted engineer at the Clar
ence water tank, arose at 3 a. m.. to go to
work. It is known that he loved his
family, but it seems that when he awoke
this morning he was seized with an un
controllable Impulse to commit the hor
rible deed. The wife was the ..flrst to suf
fer. With a clock weight Stacey killed
her by a blow on the left temple. The
daughter. Alma, was asleep In a room
upstairs with her brother James. There
the father went next, and. picking up the
boy. laid him on a cot in an adjoining
room. Then, with the clock weight, the
crazed man ended the life of his daughter.
Shortly^ before daylight Mrs. Sophia
Spitles. Stacey"s married daughter, who
lived near by, ran over on some errand.
Her father calmly told her what he had
done and the frightened woman rushed to
Inform her husband, who immediately
ran over to the Stacey home. Before he
arrived he heard the report of a gun.
Stacey was found lying on the porch with
his head nearly blown off by the contents
of a heavily loaded shotgun. He had
placed the barrel in his mouth and pulled
the trigger with his toes.
The little boy. who was unharmed, is
unable to give any account of the tragedy.
The father was addicted to no bad habits
and had, it is stated, amassed quite - a
fortune. He owned sixty acres of fine
land and had other property. His home
life was pleasant and in the village of
Clarence no family was more highly
respected than was Stacey's. The dead
wife was a sister of R. E. Dale, one of
the most prominent citizens. Stacey's
sanity had never been Questioned, but
now it is thought long hours of work and
loss of Bleep unbalanced his mind and im
pelled him to commit the frightful deed.

vertised on Tuesday morning for â¢ a '. do
mestic servant, and in response a young
woman called at the ' house -yesterday
morning. and was engaged, . Mra. . Tibbitts
being somewhat of : an' invalid. The first
duty assigned to the new servant was -to
go upstairs to Mr. Tibbitts' . room and
awaken him. The girl knocked.* at the
door, and receiving no answer, opened it
and was. almost -overcome by the fumes
of the deadly gas. i As soon as she got a
glimpse of the dead body ; lying on the
bed she ran out of the house and disap
peared. As Mrs. Tibbitts had not taken
the girl's name , the Coroner's deputies
were unable to obtain her as, a witness.
The testimony at the inquest was to the
effect that ; Mr. Tibbitts had been a suf

had frequently threatened to commit sui

CITT WHO DIED YESTERDAY
AFTER A LINGERING ILLNESS.
Physical Examination of Pupils.
Dr. Winslow Anderson has submitted to
the Board -of Education a proposition to
make an examination of the pupils in the
public schools' to determine whether their
eyes, ears, throat or nose are affected,
v.-ith a view to effecting a cure. The sys
tem has been established in several East
ern cities, notably Cincinnati. Chicago and
Milwaukee, with success. Dr. g Anderson
says that â¢ many children are suffering
from, diseases of the orpans named, which
are conducive to part of the dullness pre
vailing: among some pupils. Director Cas
serly is in favor of the plan, but the other
members of the board are disinclined to
p-.it it In operation on account of the ex
pected opposition of .parents, although the
system does not contemplate the com
pelling of pupils to submit to an opera
tion. The Board of Health was asked to
take the matter up, but claims that it is
something entirely within the jurisdiction
of the School Board. â¢

The Southern Pacific has arranged to
run a special train to Santa Clara again
this evening to accommodate those who
wish to attend the reproduction of the
"Passion Play," which proved such a
great success last night and Monday

The honor and emoluments of the Sher
iffs office are appreciated by the politi
cians. It Is known that John Lackmann
intends to go before the Republican
nominating convention and make a vigor
ous contest for renominatlon. His
friends are already actH'.e and will not
lose Bight of his interests when the dis
trict delegate tickets to be voted for on
primary election day are made up. Mr.
Lackmann Is not the only candidate in
the field. E. H, Aigeltinger, ex-Supervls
or. hay and grain merchant and president
of the Golden Gate Driving Association,
is surrounded by friends who fancy that
he can win the nomination and election.
Cclonel Charles E. Boxton, dean of the
dental college, and late major of the first
California U. S. volunteers, is backed by
supporters who maintain that the office
under his administration would be admir
ebi^ conducted. W. A. Deane talks of re
linquishing his bright prospects for an
other term as County Clerk for the pur
pose dt entering the contest for Sheriff.
Harry Baehr is also urged to enter the
race and may be listed among the as
pirants for the office. In the Democratic
column of prospective candidates stand:
Supervisors L. J. Dwyer and P. J. Curtis,
T H. McCarthy. Richard Whelan and
John McDade.
. When the time comes for nominating a
candidate for District Attorney there will
be no scarcity of patriots ready to serve
the public. 'At this time the Republicans
can Une up General E. S. Salomon, Frank
McGowan, John A. Hosmer and E. Myron
Wolf All these candidates are orators.
The last named is expecting to get a
prize in the next drawing of Governor
Gage's lottery. If his expectations are
realized he will not press his claims for
th^ District Attorneyship. The offloe that
Mr. Wolf expects is that of Building and
Loan Commissioner. The term or" the
Df-raocratic Incumbent. Frank Gould, has
expired, or is soon to expire. Informa-
tion respecting the expiration of the- term
Is not derived from the State Blue Book.
According to that record Mr. Gould's term
will net expire until 1903. Governor Gage
is said to be in possession of facts regard
ing the date of Mr. Gould's appointment
which the Blue Book does not set forth.
The Democrats will be able to present
an imposing array of candidates for Dis
trict Attorney before the entries close.
L. F. Byington, the incumbent, and Her
bert Choynski are already on the list.
Members of Martin Kelly's county com
mittee will hold a reunion next Monday
evening. Reminiscences of ballot-box
stuffing and smashing at the last open
primary will be related. Alfred Bouvier,
the unfortunate, is not In town, hence the
meeting of his committee will ' not take
place until later In the season.
Last Tuesday evening a Republican

PHILIP S. FAT, a prominent Demo
crat and well-known business man
of this city, died yesterday morn
ir.fi: at his home, S34 Grove street.
He had been In Ill-health for
many months, but it was not until about
two weeks ago that his condition became
serious. He then commenced to decline
rapidly and his death was dally expected.
Mr. Fay was born In New York in "842
and came to California before attaining
his majority. For a number of years he
was In the employ of the late James Phe
lan, father of Mayor Phelan. He later
engaged in the stock brokerage business
and during the great mining excitement
several years ago he was one of the best
known brokers on Pine street.
Mr. Fay always found time to take an
active interest in politics and in many a
pait campaign he contributed largely
toward securing success for the Demo
cratic ticket. He was considered one of
the shrewdest of political advisers and not
a few noliticlans owed their prestige to
following his advice. He was. at all times
willing to further the ambitions of his
friends and particularly was this the case
with young men who sought his counsel.
Of late years he had been engaged in the
contracting business and he was one of
the first to Introduce bituminous pavement
In this city.
The deceased leaves a wife and nine
children. Charles Fay, one of the sons, is
secretary to Mayor Phelan, while another
son. Phil J. Fay. is secretary of the Park*
Commission. The funeral will take place
to-morrow from Sacred Heart Church.
FAITHFUL ALREADY CASTING EYES
AT PLUMS THEY HOPE TO GATHER
An opinion of considerable interest to
organized labor was handed down yester
day by United States District Judge de
Kaven in the suit brought by Labor Sec
retary. Edward Rosenberg against .the
Union Iron Works.
The suit was filed by Henry E. Monroe,
attorney for" Secretary' Rosenberg, and al
leged that the Union Iron Works had vio
lated the act of Congress, approved Feb
ruary 26, 18S5, entitled, "An act to pro
hibit the importation and immigration of
foreigners or aliens under contract or
agreement to perform labor in the United
States, its Territories and the District of
Columbia." The complaint set forth that
the defendant entered into contract with
Carl Englund, a subject of the Kingdom
of Sweden and residing therein', whereby
Englund should emigrate to the United
States and labor for the defendant as a
coppersmith for one year, the defendant
to prepay his passage from Sweden to
San Francisco and to pay him "from $3 to
$4 per day!' for his services. Plaintiff
averred that because of such violation of
law the defendant had become liable to a
penalty in the shape of a fine of S1000 to
be paid to Secretary Rosenberg in com
pliance with the provisions of the act.
Wilson & Wilson, attorneys for the
Union Iron Works, demurred to the com
plaint on two grounds; first, that the DisÂ»
trict Court had no jurisdiction, and sec
ond, that the complaint did not set forth
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of ac
tion.
Judge de Haven decides that his court
has jurisdiction. On the second ground
of the demurrer he rules that the action is
m t prosecuted for the " benefit of the
Uniied States; that the plaintiff is not en
titled to maintain the action for his own
benefit and that the complaint is defective
in that it does not appear that the action
is brouerht to recover a- "penalty for the
United States.
The demurrer Is sustained and the plain
tiff is given ten days to amend the com
plaint in conformity with the court's opin
ion. Â¦ Â¦ ' /
The following are extracts from the act
on which Judge de. Haven bases his de
cision:
Section 3â That for every violation of any of
the provisions of section 1 of this act the per
son Â« â¢ â¢ shall forfeit and pay for every
such offense the sum of one thousand dollars,
which may be sued for and recovered by the
United States or by any person who shall first
bring his action therefor, including any such
alien or foreigner who may be a party to any
such contract or agreement, as debts ot like
of the United States; the proceeds to be paid
into the Treasury of the United States. â¢ â¢ â¢
And it shall be the duty of the District At
torney of the proper district to prosecute every
such suit at the expense of the United States-.

Although reports have been current
for some days that an agreement was
about to be reached. between the striking
cooks and waiters and the members of the
Restaurant Keepers' Association. Presi
dent Johnson of the latter association saya
that the matter is as far from settlement
as ever.
"There was an ill-advised conference be

representatives of the Cooks' and Waiters'
Alliance on Tuesday afternoon, but the
Restaurant Keepers' Association repudi
ates such action," said President Johnson.
"We are willing to treat with the mem
bers of the alliance, but we draw the line
with dealing with the Pan Francisco;La
bor Council and its affiliated bodies."

Diseases and
\v Weakness of
fTOjMENONIiT
IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF GENERAL
debility, and convalescence following- certain
diseases, such is the io-wered standard of the
I vital processes that the function of no organ is
1 perfectly performed, and with the resulting: de- ;
I pressicn,the patient lias a REAL weakness.'
The physician's first thought, under these con-
. dlt'.ons, Is nerve and other tonics.
I Not Weakness ; Symptoms
I - By far the greater, number of patients, how- !
i ever, seelcine relief for so-called "Weakness" |
Is furnished by healthy- and robust men. On
- examination, I we find a Prostate Gland which
! has been damaged by -either- a, contracted -dls-
! order or early j dissipation. These patients
have no weakness at all. Pretnatureness, Loss.
of Vitality, etc., are the ' symptoms, or disor-
dered function, of the chronically inflamed
prostate gland. We find by curing this inflam-
mation- that full vipor at once returns. Â¦ It
should be understood that tonics, electricity,
etc., might cure a real weakness, but would do
harm in Inflammation. . The main object is to
reduce the size of the tender, swollen and In-
flamed prostate. This we accomplish by local
treatment, thus avoiding drugs. Men who have
.unsuccessfully treated for a weakness , should
now understand the cause of failure.

THE HICKS-JUDD CO.^'
â¢ i- - â¢ . ,. .. ; - *3 Fim Street Ban Francitco.The disappearance of the long hostility between the
two > races is- a fact of great importance -in European
affairs. It is' a striking evidence of the wisdom of the
Kaiser's policy "of conciliation toward France arid jus
tifies, his action in "dismissing Bismarck # and "getting
rid.of the old ariti- French influences at his court. For
many a year it was:doubtful.whether.his repeated man
ifestations of a desire for friendly relations with France
would have" any marked effect, but it now seems they
have been successful. . By w reason/of. the clash; of in
terests*between French. and British in Africa French
hostility , has once more turned against the ancient
foe,-,and for; the present. the'Kaiser sees^hisknopes of
a friendly France blossoming around? him. 'He may
yet live to see "Frahce included in the famous alliance
withV Austria and Italy,, and thus 'obtain, for Germany
and himself the undisputed headship of Western' Eu
rope,;.with strength enough' to undertake thegreatest
adventures his, ambition may prompt.
While the . troopers ! of the two nations were thus
showing in a rough way their friendliness a similar
feeling was -being exhibited in a widely different' way
in Germany itself. The Kaiser's annual spring, re
view of the guards 'at Berlin was attended this year by
a number of French officers for the first time since the
Franco-Prussian war. â¢ The Kaiser is said to have
shown them marked attention at every stage of the
review, and in the course^ of his speech at the ban
quet afterward he said: "The Brigade of Guards en
joysthe honor 'of the presence oftwo gallant French
officers among them' for the first time' in many years,
as also for. the first. time French and German- soldiers
fought shoulder to - shoulder for "Â¦ civilization,
against' a common 'foe in faithful and loyal brother
hood^ I hail, the' fact with great satisfaction.' I drink
to the health of the : two, gallant officers arid their
glorious army." ,. .. ' ; ' \ " , . . v
A recent dispatch from Tientsin announced a serious
affray among the troops in that city caused by the in
terference of the British Fusileers, who were acting
as a. police, to prevent a. number of French soldiers
from housebreaking: , The French, resenting the in
terference, attacked the" British, and as soon as the
affray became known a number of German soldiers
went to the, assistance of the "French, and it was not
until a strong guard was called t out that the affray
was checked.:, ; .
OF the minor events connected with the joint
occupation of. China by the allied troops
: none have been more interesting than the fre
quent manifestations of international' likes and dis
likes among the rank and file of the various armies.
It might have been expected that the French and the
Germans^ for example, would regard each other with
a mutual hostility, but the reverse has been the case.
In fact, the soldiers of the two former enemies have
repeatedly fraternized, while neither of them has
shown any liking for the. British or for ourselves.
THE -FRENCH AND THE GERMANS:-
ANOTHER RISE IN BEEF.
WHEN beef advanced, 40 per cent last winter
those who do not seek, far for causes said -it
was due to the season of the year. .That rise
has remained, become permanent, and is now followed
by another rise of 3 cents a pound" right in the height"
of the grazing season, when the spring grasses are at
their best and the conditions affecting. the production
of beef are in their most favorable phase. , No sorcery
is needed to find the cause of this permanent rise in an
important food article. It is found in' the decrease of
the supply. The most economical production of beef,
is on the ranges, in the arid regions west of the
ninety-ninth meridian. The cattle industry there has
supplied the domestic demand and kept the slaught
ering centers busy packing for a growing foreign de
mand. JBut in the six years last past the range cattle
have decreased 60 per cent, the supply has. fallen. off
more than half, while the domestic demand "increases
with the. population and the foreign demand spreads
with the increase of ouk export trade. "
Cattle men know that to-day there are no big
steers left in the United, States. The stock has been
gleaned down 'until animals are slaughtered younger
than ever before, and the calf crop is invaded to sup
ply the butcher's block. It takes three years to pro
duce a big steer, and with the younglings sent to the
poleax the crop of full. age animals is cut off.
This condition is brought about by the decrease in
range cattle, and that in turn is due to the destruction
of the forage on the arid ranges of the public do
main. As these were used in common there has been
np disposition to preserve the grasses.' Each herds
man has eagerly secured what' he could in the pres
ent and without regard to the future. Finally, the
ranges are being finished by sheep, which drive the
cattle off and tramp and feed the forage clean, leaving
neither root nor seed for. renewal of the crop.
The remnant of the cattle interest is in battle array
to protect grass enough to feed what cattle are left.
The sheep have destroyed the fine public pastures in
Southern Utah, and are now being driven into Colo
rado and Nevada to encroach on the cattle ranges.
The day that beef rose 3 cents a pound in Chicago
cowboys at Gunnison, Colo., surrounded 5000 Utah
sheep, made prisoners^ of the shepherds and killed
2500 sheep. Similar war in Idaho and .Wyoming,
Montana and Arizona, has already been commented
upon.
The sheep first drive out cattle and then -destroy
what is left of the pasture, and have to be driven on
to repeat the operation, leaving the country a^desert
behind them. It is a struggle for existence on pub
lic property, for the use of which there is nÂ© law nor
regulation, except poison and the Winchester.
The sheep men enjoy the benefit of a heavy wool
tariff, get the feed for their sheep for nothing and
destroy cattle-growing, to the injury of the beef
eater, who must pay higher prices. They. inflict, there
fore, a triple exaction upon the people^ â the wool
tariff, the destruction of public property on the
ranges, and a higher price for beef. , The remedy is
simple, easily within reach and does no injustice to
the sheep or cattle interest. It lies in the leasing of
the arid ranges, under such regulation as protects" the
small and large stock-t>\vner, the mineral prospector
and the agricultural homesteader. Then those who
use this public p'roperty will pay for its use; each
stock man will keep his sheep and cattle on his own
leasehold; each will take an interest in the renewal
of the forage; the ranges will carry more stock; the
beef supply will increase, benefiting both the pro
ducer and consumer, and the wool tariff Willie safer
when the people feel that they are not paying it for
wool which is produced at their expense, on pastures
they own, unpaid for by the flock-masters.
â¢ The American Cattle-growers' Association acknowl
edges the justice of this leasing policy. The Ameri
can Wool-growers' Association opposes it. Individual
flock-masters, who own land already and know that
the nomad sheep men are endangering the wool tariff
by their aggressions, are also in favor of leasing. \ Â¦
A Western committee is organized to draft a lease
bill for action by the next Congress. It is proposed
that the revenue from the leases, which are estimated
at $10,000,000 a year, shall be returned to the' States
and Territories where they are derived for use in irri
gation works instead of demanding appropriations for
that purpose out of the Federal treasury. It is diffi
cult to discern a reason for opposing such a law, out
side of mere selfishness expressed in a desire < to get
something for nothing. A vast portion of the public
domain in the arid regions is fit for grazing only. At
present that is its sole value, and therefore its only
value is being destroyed, permanently, by its use in
common.
The approaching national convention of the Ep
worth League in San Francisco will have two mean
ings of deep importance to the city. We will welcome
and entertain many thousands of . men and women
whom we will care very much to meet, and .-we will
be seen by people whose impressions of us we will
strive to make the best.
The local'dunese slaves who change their names
as they change their masters are inspired probably by
the same reason by which a new name is given: to a
Jonah shipâ deception. , - .
The labor exploited in the operation will be Ameri
can labor, forced to meet coolie competition. Filipino
labor cannot be exploited, for there is none.
Not a word about the placeboic dose of commercial
and fiscal union. They do not want a union whose
benefits are to come to them only as the result of hard
work. They can enjoy a political union, the indepen
dence of incorporation into the Union of the United
States, without working, and that is what they want.
The country can be exploited, but the people cannot
be. Its exploitation can be brought about only by
the emplojinent of Chinese coolie labor, and the profit
of the exploiters' will arise in low wages and free ad
mission to the American market, which is what'eom
mercial and fiscal union means.
Mr. Albert Sonnichsen has just published a book,
"Ten Months a Captive Among the Filipinos," which
is indorsed by Dewey and other American officers,
and also by papers of such opposite opinions as the
Outlook, the Nation and the New York Times. Son
nichsen agrees with nearly every other observer of
the Philippine situation that the insurgent govern
ment had the practically unanimous support of the
people, but they were willing to have peace on con
ditions stated by the Presidents of Ilocano, who fa
vored American rule but said: "The only basis on
which peace can be established between us and the
Americans is the total abolition of monastic frater
nities and representation in your Congress,, with home
self-government. On no other terms will the insur
gents surrender, and, although they may be conquered
by superior forces, the spark of rebellion will always
remain ready to burst into flame , at every oppor
tunity."
Now we do not believe that the great body of Fili
pinos care a fig for commercial and fiscal union.
They are not a commercial, industrial nor industrious
people. Like all tropical people, they have no com
mercial ambition. The labor in the islands which pro
duces a surplus for export is Chinese, labor. The na
tives do not dream of commercial greatness.
If the Chronicle mean that the Philippines and
Porto. Rico arc to be made potential States, by being
made Territories, as a condition of Republican peace,
there will be no peace. The American people do not
want such States, nor such citizens, and therefore do
not want any party to take the first step toward
making them States and citizens. No doubt that is
what the Filipinos want, and from their standpoint we
do not blame them. But there is also an American
standpoint, which will be ignored by any party at its
peril.
The Chronicle says that only "commercial and fis
cal union is demanded, not Anly as a means of pre
venting the commercial exploitation of a subject peo
ple, but also as the only means by which they can
ever become loyal American citizens, or by which we
can escape the cost and disgrace of holding in sub
jection a discontented and rebellious people by main
taining in their midst a standing army of what they
will consider an alien race."
THE San Francisco Chronicle discovers that
there is need of immediate peace within the
Republican party, and that it can be secured
only by placing the Philippines "where Hawaii now
is and Porto Rico soon will be."
THE ISLAND ISSUE.
SENATOR MORGAN'S PROGRAMME.
SENATOR MORGAN is not so much occupied
with the task of providing a means for disfran
chising the negroes of Alabama without violat
ing the letter of the constitution of the United States
as to be neglectful of the need Â¦ of the Democratic
party for guidance in national affairs. He has re
cently contributed to the discussion of, that subject
a lengthy letter, in which he sets forth the platform
and the tactics by which he believes Democracy, may
win. . .--;-Â¦; Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'â¢â¢ ' :* *"- >. -
â¢ After an elaborate review of the situation as seen ;
from his intensely partisan standpoint and extensive
arguments upon various issues which he; would have
the Democratic party take up he summarizes the
whole platform in this way: "A demand for the pay
ment of the national debt; for free markets, without
payment of tariff taxes, between each' arid every port
of the world that is included within the . sovereign
ownership and possession of the United States; for
the old specie basis, as broad and solid as it can be
made by all the treasures of gold and silver that. we
can control, . at the ratio of 16 to 1, or' 'something
equally as good'; for the annexation ofXuba, with
the free consent of those people; for. the government
of the Philippines through acts of Congress, 'and
offices created by law", with salaries fixed by law;; and
appointments to office, when made by the President,
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,' and
not by legislators; and Judges whose official conduct
shall be 'in such manner as the President shall direct,'
as the Spooner amendment requites; the collection
of the income taxes, as required by' the Dingley. tariff
law, which is in force, according to the official admis
sion of the President;, arid by unrelenting opposition
to all abuses of the powers of taxation.", ' ;. : ) '-" Â¦
Jt will be seen the old fighter is eager to, fight all
his battles. o'er again. He wishes to revive the free
trade agitation, the free silver controversy . and â¢ the

second function , Is by - far the most im
portant, for it will give knowledge which
can' be applied not only to the given pa
tient, not only utilized by the community
In which It has -arisen, but which Is of
general applicability everywhere, within
the scope which it specifically covers.
All these remarks are true of hospitals
in general, but why should children's
hospitals be especially established- along
such lines as are here outlined? All that
has gone before in these papers shows
that every fact relating to the natural
history of child life is a fact utillzable
for the benefit of. the race In a construc
tive way, and not merely in a. separative
way. In pathology It promotes preven
tion, and "an ounce of prevention Is
worth a pound of cure." -
Physical Development of the Child.
.Important as is the mtitter of the physi
cal development of : the child, it has not
received* the attention It deserves. The
first formal treatise on the diseases of
children was published in Sweden about
150 years ago, and the bulk of the world's
literature . on thai subject has - been pro
duced In the past thirty yeara, and this
In a profession which has existed for cen
turies. Even to-day 'the subject is treat
ed in a stepmotherly way in our medical
colleges,' comparatively few of Â» which
made adequate provision for its teaching.
The term physical training, which ,is
broad enough to cover the management
of the whole body, has Instead a . very
special and limited meaning, referring en
tirely to gymnastic and allied proceed
tures. Physical training has for ita pri
mary ideal muscular development, and
only incidentally the improvement of oth
er structures of the body. That exercise
does influence all other structures of the
body is, of course, true; so also is It true
that Improvement of other organs and
structures influences secondarily the
muscular system. Physical training may,
and often does, influence organs other
than the muscles unfavorably, and its
indiscriminate use is to be Â¦ guarded
against. It is a powerful engine, and that
it is not always used with just discrimi
nation is not to be laid at its door, for it
not a means of investigation, but merely
of application, and principles modifying
its use must be sought through other
channels. .
Intellectual Development in Schools.
The intellectual development of the child
is intrusted to the schools, the greatest
single institution which the race pos
sesses. If it was necessary. to deplore the
slow accumulation of knowledge relating
to the physical development of the child.
it is more . necessary to deplore the still
slower accumulation of knowledge relat
ing to the child's Intellectual development.
In both instances a priori ideas and meth
ods of application have predominated, and
investigation of principles has lagged.
The educational world was surprised
some years ago by the intrusion of psy
chology into its domain. It is, however,
gradually accommodating itself to the in
trusion. More recently . it has met an
other intruder, in the shape of the so
called child study, which as yet has by
no means received a warm welcome. Both
these intruders have brought with them
the idea of Investigation. Each has as its
function the determination of facts relat
ing to the development of the child, and
from these facts the -formulation of defi
nite ; laws ,' of development, which must
subsequently be used to modify the peda
gogic methods and subject matter." - " : Â¦*.
-Schools were originally established to
train the intellectual functions of the
brain." The training of the other func
tions of the brain was left to the other
activities of the child, which accomplished
the work fairly well. So -long, as life was
limited to relatively small communities
where the activities of the children , were
numerous and varied a wide education
occurred. But when the advancement of
"civilization : produced â conditions which
prevented the child from coming into di
rect and frequent contact with nature
this education failed. Contact with plant
and animal life not only. gave information
concerning such objects, but trained the
senses through which such information
.was obtained. . The more natural, less so
phistical and wider range : of plays and
duties gave to the child of a generation
ago an opportunity for motor training, of
which he is to-day largely deprived. Such
part of a child's life is as truly education
as is the intellectual training. . The de
ficiency to-day of such training makes it
necessary for some other agency to take
up the work. This agency can only be the
school, at least for the overwhelming ma
jority of the children- in large cities. The
schools are attempting this new duty and
thus- there appears in the modern curric
ulum manual . training and other con
structive work, drawing, music, nature
study and physical training.! Thus, the
schools," Â¦ originally organized for the pur
pose of promoting the development of the
intellectual function of -the brain, find
themselves forced to moderate the devel-

For a long time "there has been -a demand on the
part of good citizens for a, law which will ensure hon
esty and fair dealing at the primaries. 1 ' There is every
reason to believe the present law fulfills those de
mands, but it is to be borne in mind it does no more
than dflford men a right to vote and to have the vote
counted.. If good' citizens stay away .from the pri
maries we shall-iiave no better municipal government
than heretofore. The issue is before the citizens. The
bosses will have every man of their following regis
tered and ready for voting when the election takes
place, and unless the better elements of the com
munity are equally vigilant and active the victory will
go to the bosses. - _ -
It is estimated that there are upward of 15,000 voters
in the city who are entitled to register and to vote,
but whose names have not yet been registered. Among
them'are quite sure to be many of that class of citi
zens upon whom the ' municipality depends for the
election of hoiiesVand capable officials. Such men
wrong not only themselves but their fellow citizens
and the community as a whole when they neglect a
political duty of this kind, and accordingly any one
who has not properly registered should at once attend
to it.
. 6/ All- persÂ»is who were registered, but by moving out
of their respective precincts, or' otherwise, have lost
their right to vote. â¢ . . " â¢
6. All electors who have changed their residence from
county in this State to this county since the
last general election, and prior to May 15, 1901.
4. All foreign-born citizens naturalized within ninety
/days next preceding the last general electi^i,; and all
foreign-boi-n citizens naturalized since the last general
election and prior to May 15, 1901." ,.
i 3. All native - male Â¦ citizens not - registered who have
secured a residence in the State and county since the
last general election. â¢ ......
The first duty to be attended to is that of registra
tion. Citizens who were registered last year and
who have not changed their, residence need not regis
ter; but there are considerable numbers of â¢ persons
entitled to register and to vote who are not in that
category. The Registrar, has recently issued a no
tice that his office is now open for registration for the
primaries and. will continue open for that purpose
until the close of August 3. The following are en
titled to register and must do so if they . desire to
take part in the primaries: Â¦ . -
1. All persons not registered at the last election, but
who were, entitled thereto.
2. All native male citizens who have arrived at age
since the last general election.
ALTHOUGH-* the municipal primary elections
are not. to be held until August 13 it is none
the' less. full time for good citizens to give at
tention to .them' and to* arrange/ for taking part in
them. The politicians are already active, and it is a
foregone conclusion that the bosses have their fol
lowing in readiness even at this early date.
PREPARE FOR THE - PRIMARIES.
According to a decision of the United States Su
preme Court corporations that have extended their
mining shafts under the city of Leadville must pay for
the privilege of working them, and it is estimated the
royalty will amount " to $2,000,000 a year. Leadville
ought to be able to live easy on that.

Functions of a Hospital.
Hospitals were originally established to
take care gratuitously of sick people who
were unable -to. provide themselves with
proper attention at home. -This function
of > course still attaches to hospitals. But
additional > functions have been added. , It
was soon found that the 4arge number of
cases of various diseases brought together
in a large hospital afforded most excellent
means for studying the natural history of
disease. Then the hospitals became pro
vided with . means : for observing after
death those results of the / disease
which could not be observed directly dur
ing life. These means could not readily,
or conveniently be used at private homes,
and it is a fact that nearly, all our knowl
edge of morbid anatomy, has been gained
from the autopsies made in hospitals.
When methods of treatment, such as those
of modern surgery. â¢ came | to -demand ; an
extensive and - complex >a plant Â» f or; v their
proper performance, t plants , whieh f could
not possibly Â» be established at short no
tice, the hospital - added to its previous
functions and became ; a - place which all
requiring and desiring, the best attention
were glad to have provided . for their
needs., Now that : methods of diagnosis
are becoming more and more complex and
require for their , proper performance ad
juncts which :.Â¦ cannot f be carried Ao the
private house, it : is a fact that the hum
blest . imtient in a well-equipped hospital
can receive more Â¦ complete and Â« therefore
better attention-, than â¢ can be commanded
in any private home. .,
Value of Children's Hospitals.
' , The duty of . collecting facts relating to
physical development/as well as the duty
of formulating the applications of these
facts, has been relegated. to the so-called
biologic professions, represented by zoolo
gists, anatomists, physiologists, patholo
gists arid physicians. '. , These professions
have studied the normal development of
the child both in structure and in func
tion. They have; moreover, studied the
influence Â¦ of vicious environment in the
production "of abnormal or. pathological
conditions. It has been their duty to give
us the natural history, of normal nutri
tion, and the causes and effects of mal
nutrition; to work out the influence of
climate and other geographic factors; to
investigate the causes and effects of in
fections; of proper and improper physical
activities and mental activities; to tra*ce
the effects and-dimlnlsh,the damages of
traumatism, and the effects of discipline
to some extent come within their pur
view. But with all this work, and the
numerous facts obtained and the exten
sive generalizations rendered possible by
these facts; many problems are pressing
for solution and- crying for more facts.
The work has been done in laboratories,
in the fields and at the^bedside. Of all
the various agencies for work of this kind
there are two kinds .. which stand pre
eminently forward as promising impor
tant results at present in the problem of
child development and its corollary, child
training. These two are laboratories for
so-called child study and children's hos
pitals. â¢ '.Â» * -.â¢â¢' ' '.'Â¦ . . .-â¢ . â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦' Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦;Â¦ ;,.'..
How Facts Are Collected.
As shown in the preceding paper the in
fant at birth is very incompletely devel
oped.' Nevertheless it Is endowed with a
heredity which predetermines in general
the lines along which its development Is
to proceed, but specifically this develop
ment is determined by the environmental
factors. On the .wholei adaptation -to en
vironment is expressed in the customs of
society. These customs, established al
most entirely % involuntarily, are over
whelmingly advantageous to the race, and
he would be a bold man and a dangerous
counselor who would advise sweeping and
far-reaching changes in Trell-established
customs. This is far from implying, how
ever, that existing customs are the best
possible adjustment to environment. It
is. practically certain, onÂ» the contrary,
that they are ,not, and that -important
advantages are to be gained by slight
modifications of customs, based upon
an accurate knowledge of the totality of
conditions and by adapting them to the
demands of . individual I cases. . Opinions
are worth but little except as they -are
attempts to Interpret facts, but 1 acts are
very precious, difficult to get, cost much
in time, effort and money. It will be
well, therefore, to inquire what agencies
exist for the collection of facts regarding
the development of the child and what
agencies there are for the ! application of
these facts.
The aim of child training may be stated
to be to produce in the individual child
the greatest intellectuality and highest
morality that the individual is capable of
attaining. The aim thus formulated must
not be construed as excluding physical
training, or ignoring the advantages of
first-class physical condition. On the con
trary, the highest possible physical per
fection is necessarily included in the aim,
as without it the highest possible intellec
tual and moral development is not at
tainable. The glorious, achievements of
the fighting line of an army would not
long be maintained if the commissary de
partment failed in its function.
The Aim of Child Training.
Hie Intellectual development is con
cerned with a certain phase of brain ac
tion:
Both these phases of life relate princi
pally to the individual.
Moral development, however, has as its
predominant concern the relation of the
individual to his fellows.
i Ihe development of the physical side of
life is concerned with the body as a whole
and its E several organs, including the
brain. > Â¦ . Â¦Â¦Â¦ .
Man's life is ' I frequently.- spoken of as
threefold in characterâ physical, Intellec
tual and moral. The subdivision is a'con
venient one provided 'it is recognized that
the three phases are not ' absolutely dis
tinct f from _..! each other, but axe closely
correlated and interwoven. >Â¦
In a preceding paper it was shown that
man. has risen to his present high estate
because of the prolonged period of in
fancy or plasticity with which his species
is endowed. Most of his -advancement has
been through the slow process of natural
selection. ; Child training implies that in
telligent advantage Is to be taken of the
natural processes of development, with a
view to the most complete possible devel
opment of the individual. Child training,
to bo intelligent or scientific, must be
based upon the natural history of man's
development in all of its phases, together
with the natural history of the "environ
mental factors operative in modifying the
development as predetermined by her
edity. * Â¦ . â¢

The world is filled to-day with people
who studying- the problem of the child,
some to establish new truths and some to
apply them, and no more hopeful move
ment for civilization was ever undertaken.
â¢ When the ethical training: of tlia child is
considered. great difficulties are encoun
tered. The home is, of course, the insti
tution for this part of child training, but
when the wide variation in thÂ» capacities
of individual homes is considered, some
additional agency seems demanded. The
church has assumed this function, on the
ground that ethics and religion are essen
tially united. But the church- has failed
to investigate for us the laws of the de
velopment of ethics. Whichever one of
the numerous theories of the genesis of
ethics we may accept, we must admit that
the laws of the development of the
ethical nature of the Individual child are
not known, and until they are, discussion
of ethical training must ! be largely
theoretical and unprofitable.
Ethical Training" of the Child.
The "child study" department of the
Chicago public schools baa three distinct
functions. The first is research work. In
which It attempts to determine laws of
child development, partly with, reference
to the physical side, but more particularly
in the line of psychical development. With
the establishment of such laws It not only
provides suggestions for method* of teach
ing, but it also has a mechanism by
means of which It can test the efficacy of
existing methods and determine 'whether
or not these methods train the brain as
they are supposed to train it. As another
feature of ita work It has a pyschologflcal
laboratory for examining backward chil
dren, with a view to .advising as to their
management. - 1 Beth tho | laboratory and
the general research work approximate
efforts at - individualism of school work.
The one is absolutely Individualistic and
the other by Introducing new elements of
classification makes an approach to indi
vidualistic work which Is valuable.
In this way there in a true criterion of
the propriety of the Introduction, into tho
curriculum of any proposed work. If that
work 'tends to training any . function of
the brain, not otherwise provided for, it
is. a proper subject for. the schools, and
not a "fad." If It does not meet this re
quirement It Is not proper school work.
Applying this test to the curriculum now
in effect it will be found that not all the
subjects meet this requirement. ' The dan
ger of overloading toe course of study Is
one which Is very real, but it will cer
tainly be "found, when *inore of the laws
of child development are established, that
all the results of the old work, and also
the benefits of the new, can be had with
out additional . labor . on the part of the
child "or Increase m the time of school
work. To hasten this end much lnvestl-'
gation must be made in the line of child
study. This subject has been much culti
vated by private investigators, and much
good work accomplished, but certain
phases of It can be prosecuted success
fully only under, the immediate direction
of the school authorities. The action of
the Chicago Board of Education in es
tablishing a department of child study in
the system of schools under its charge is
thus far unique, but it would seem that
it ought, to be followed in other large
cities, so that the combined efforts of sev-'
eral such departments could give to the
educational world the results of their la
bors, and in this way promote the adjust
ment of school 'work.

ness a well could be sunk somewhere in the
district, and if oil is struck each of the com
panies would own an undivided interest there
in, and all would be indirectly benefited - by
having the district proven, and the . burden Of
doing so would not fall on any one company.
It is known that oil does exist northwest and
southeast of this district . and the belt must
extend through here between the two ranges
of mountains. The gas and oil found .by the
San Benito County affords sufficient evidence
that oil measures at least exist in this vicinity.
According to the Hollister Bee, W. I*
Watts has reported to the Hollister Pe
troleum Development Company that sink
ing a well on the Baldwin ranch, which is
under lease to the company named, would
be> an uncertain experiment, i. The escape
of gas from the Lathrop well was re

measures in the district and the discovery
of small quantities of oil in salt water in

Captain C. M. Thomas is now in com
mand of the Oregon.
Oregon flag:.
AFTER an absence of three years,
during which time she has earned
the sobriquet of "The Bulldojr of
the American Navy," the battle
ship Oregon Is on her way home
arain. Early last month she left Shang
hai for San Francisco in company with
the collier Isis, and on May 11 reached
Tckohama. There she was coaled and on
May 16 at 4 p. m. she got under way for
Honolulu, while the Isis went back to
Hongkong.
As she passed out of Yokohama harbor
the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Gaelic was going in and the
two vessels saluted each other. The
Oregon was flying- her homeward-bound
pennant and the officers on the Gaelic say
it is a beauty. It is 420 feet long and is
made of the finest sjlk that could be
bought for money in China. The British
cruiser Bonaventura Â¦was also homeward
bound and she had a very fine pennant,
the end of which was kept out of the
water by a real balloon, but it could not
compare in point of beauty with the
On her arrival at Ban Francisco the
chances are that the Oregon will gro out
of commission temporarily and be com
pletely remodeled. She is equipped with
circular turrets, and when the thirteen
inch puns are pointed in the same direc
tion the hull heels to such an extent as
to expose the unprotected portion below
the armor belt. This was particularly
noticeable in the Spanish war and the
Government Intends rectifying the defect.
It Is proposed to remove the four
quadrilateral turrets, accommodating two
eight-inch puns each, with which the ship
is equipped, and to install two elliptical
e!jerht-inch turrets on top of the thirteen
inch turrets, thus giving the Oregon
superimposed turrets. Careful determina
tion of the position of the eight-inch tur
rets will permit a balance which will pre
vent the heeling- now considered so ob
jectionable. The new battery arrange
ments will permit the addtiion of a
formidable row of six-inch guns. - "r. Â¦
Under easy steam the Oregon should
have reached Honolulu about June 1. It
would then take her five days to coal
there and about nine days to make the run
to San Francisco, so that she should be
here about the 15th inst. A rousing re-

to find purity and low price in a single soap

NEW TORK, June 6.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's " London financial . cablegram says:
Business .on 'the .Stock 1 Exchange .here' to-day
dwindled down' to' almost Infinitesimal propor
tions. There was a general exodus to: witness
the Derby. What jjj dealings there Â¦ were cen
tered in,; the' .American .department. ,-. Those
stocks alone were fairly: active. In the early
dealings traders were mainly inclined to sell
on the theory. that stocks had enjoyed a rath
er sharp rise and that a reaction was about
due. Denver and 'Rio Grande came to the
rescue, however, and led a rally on what
was generally assumed to be Gould buying.
Atchlson also spurted on buying for 'the New
York account. The close was at the top
figures of * the day, . the coal stocks being - es
pecially favorable. Â¦ . Â¦

time during the day,' diminished decidedly after
a while. When the check was first declslvely
establlEhed there was a notable falling- away
in the volume cf dealings, but there was a re
sumption of activity before the close, this time
on the eel!lng side, and the closing was de
cidedly weak, with some wide breaches effected
Sn prices. The progressive decline in the
BtrenKth of the market is probably due to the
completion of realizing- profits on the various
heavy lines of stock. This profit-taking was
clearly in evidence all day, every demonstra
tion of epeclal strength in Individual stocks
being taken advantage of to prosecute the sell-
Ing elsewhere. Stocks which have shown great
eft strength recently were naturally most af
fected by the realizing. .It was current report
that much of the. buying to-day and for some
time past represented a covering of- a very
heavy line of short contracts by an Interest
which took the bear side of the market last
week in the incipient stage of the Hse, argu
ing that technical considerations called for a
reaction at that time. The sustained advance
clnce is .said to have driven this Interest to
cover at a large loss. The closing out of this
bear account also removed an Important sus
taining influence from the* market and con
tributed to the vulnerable condition which In
vited renewed attack by new comers to the
bear ranks. The sharp advances - scored in a
number of low priced stocks during the earlier
part of the day pointed clearly to manipula
tion 1n the interest of the realizing process, but
there were also many notable points of strength
developed in the market in high grade stocks.
The most sensational movement was In Rock
If land. The -late spurt in that Ftock to 175^
had a momentary Influence In stiffening- the
list after it had touched the low points of the
day to that time, but as soon as it was per
ceived that the Kock Island movement was
without effect the selling was renewed with re
doubled force. The admission of new Inter
ests to the directory of Rock Island was pret
ty clearly foreshadowed, butane extra stock
CHICAGO, June 6.â A soaking rainfall in. the
spring wheat sections .where it was \ most
needed was the dominant interest In the wheat
trade throughout the session, although other,
Items were- at hand, -at' times contributing, to
the weakness, while others caused temporary
checks. to the decline. The fact that' a lead
ing commission house is believed to be mani
pulating the j July delivery^ was apparently
overlooked by the crowd. At no time did the
support have the appearance of any strength.
Jt came almost entirely from nervous Â¦ shorta, 1
: who were quick to secure' the profits which' the'
recent slump has ' brought them. Â¦ July opened'
%c to %c lower at 76c to 76Vic/ajid sold quickly
to 75W,c. A prediction of frost in the North
west and more fly damage reports from Kan
sas caused a. rally to 76c, but a decline to 73Vic
followed In short. order. : 'Later July, helped, by
reports of a better cash demand and a mo
mentary ceÂ£Â»ation of selling-, reacted to 75%@
75%c. - As the , session .neared the end the
anxiety to unload or to take the popular short
selling side increased because of light export
clearances, and July, dropped to : 74%c. Here
the market steadied as the selling ceased, 1 but
, the close was weak, July . l%c , lower at 75c.

issue was an entire surprise to the street. - The
movement in Atchlson was more gradual and
on larger dealings. Rumors of a lease to
Union Pacific persisted, and the admission to
the directory of a member of the banking firm
which represents the Northern lines of- Pa
cific railroads ' was regarded as significant of
the progress being made toward community of
interest in that territory as a result of the
adjustment of the Northern Pacific quarrel.
Atchison's extreme rise was V&. The story of
Missouri Pacific's control of Southern Pacific
and the remainder of the exchange of Missouri
Pacific stock for the Denver and Rio Grande
stock were Influences in that group of rail
roads. Pennsylvania was affected by the pub
lished opinion of an executive officer lately, re
turned from Europe of good prospects for "the
coal export trade. Executive changes in the
Erie were taken as foreshadowing Improve
ments In operation. The strength of Illinois
Central was based on comparison of its low
price with other railroad stocks In the same
category;- Amalgamated Copper suffered from
the granting cf- a new injunction ag-ainst- its
proposed absorptions. Advances of from one
to four points in a number of low priced rail
roads and industrials were unexplained by any
news. The advance In Canadian Pacific and its
affiliated lines was designed to lift the stock
in proportion to the advance of the other
stocks of Northern Pacific lines. ,
The bond market was irregular in sympathy
with stocks. Total sales, par value, $3,651,000.
United. States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.
Weather Report.
"Favorable factors m the situation: First â
The Supreme Court decision in the Porto Rico
case. Secondâ Cuba's acceptance of the terms
for the island's government. Thirdâ The final
settlement of the London shorts in the North
ern Pacific corner, which removes the North
ern Pacific menace from both the London and
New York markets. Fourthâ The settlement
of many of the threatened strikes. Fifthâ J. P.
Morgan's early return. He will leave for home
next week; his return will improve the steel
rtocks. He will also meet his adversaries and
harmenize them: as a matter of fact, the dif
ferences heretofore existing between -them are
already 6ettled and the various parties- are
ajrajn on friendly terms. The outlook for the
coining week is for a more active market and
a higher level of prices."
"A few flays before the November election
the prices of twenty-live representative stocks
averaged $68 40 per share; on the day previous
to the Northern Pacific panic the prices of
these same shares averaged $102 44, showing
an average rise In values, during the twenty
nine weeks, of 50 per cent; and, at present, the
average price of this group of shares is 6.74
per cent lower than on May 7 and yet
41.17 per cent higher than on November 2, 1900.
These comparisons show Â«-ery strikingly how
little prices have thus far been affected by the
recent immense liquidations and how widely,
in spite of those realizations, values range
ebovc a three years' normal level. Such an
array cf facts has no parallel in the history
of Wall street's many great crises. The
causes paving the way for the great advance
had been long preparing, but were unnoticed
and without effect on either investors or specu
lators; and now that the unequaled rise has
come and has suffered the attack of an un
precedented strain on confidence, the down
ward reaction in values is only some 5 per
cent, the tension has steadily relaxed, and
among the banks and the great commission
houses there seems to be confidence enough to
support a revival of the movement , which has
shown such extraordinary strength. The re
sumption of speculation, however, is now evi
dently forthcoming, especially as there are no
signs of any spirited attempt to force a back
ward movement in prices. The bears are few
and timid and find short sales dangerous. The
strong undertone of confidence is the control
ling factor; but no extravagant bull movement
is likely to be undertaken at present, because
the trained operators are willing to bide their
time, and feel satisfied that in the fall there
will be a great revival of the speculative spirit,
v.-hich will be inspired by a fine season's busi
ness and the harvesting of crops, and then the
country will have had its confidence confirmed
in the new scale of prices, all the conditions
thus being then forthcoming for a return of
the boom to about the -phase in which the May
panic found it. This, at least, appears to be
the conclusion to which a majority of the spec
ulative element is wending its way.

: While the wool market, Is still quiet the" de
mand shows' some tendency to expands. A few
fair sized lines have Â¦ been . moved, however, but
most of- the Â¦ business still ! consists : of â¢ moderate
sized lots. The outlook for, a good . of
business is considered more encouraging, how
ever, by careful observers, who state that they
would Snot be" surprised to see a fairly good
trader in progress during the .-course .of the
next few weeks.". The trend of the goods mar
ket is still toward an improvement. A num
ber of manufacturers report that they have re-,
ceived I more '. orders, and , many of those who
come ; . Into - the market look j more hopeful "and
talk more encouragingly. As far as prices are
concerned, j however, there 'is certainly no im
provement to : be noted. The pressure exerted
by the American wools has resulted in lower-,
ing prices for good domestic quarter-bloods to
a twenty-cent basis and all lines of medium
and low wools are in buyers',, favor. . Holders of
new territory wools who paid â¢ for them the
equivalent to 40c ; clean landed are asking
prices ranging anywhere from 42c to 45c clean,
which consumers will not pay unless the wools
are very fine or run very large into; staple.
Eastern houses are still buying in the West,
and especially in Wyoming.

â¢ WILLIAM McCABE.
President Iron Trades Council.
The council Is fully advised of the fact that
men not mechanics < are being brought to this
city to work in the various shops, and also
knows that these men are not mechanics, but
laborers and farm hands from the small towns
throughout the State. Mechanics are very
hard to get at present; no one knows that bet
ter than the employers themselves. We are not
worrying about that so long as our own men
remain true to their organization. Many of
these new Importations, some of whom are
past the prime of life, have taken jobs in the
various Ehops, with the understanding that
they be given an opportunity to learn a trade.
Some of the employers are under the impres
sion that we demand the signing of an agree
ment. This is false, as we have repeatedly
stated. All we ask for is a nine-hour day with
the eame remuneration as we received for the
ten hours, and overtime substantially the same
as before.
The work of repairing the steamers So
noma, Australia, Iaqua, Arctic and Mary

Trades Council "unfair" and the union
men employed thereon have been ordered

lished in a morning paper yesterday the
following has been issued by order of the
Iron Trades Council:
IRON TRADES COUNCIL OF SAN FRAN
CISCO. June 5, 1901.
The Iron Trades Council, In view 'of the
fact that many mlsstatements regarding the
standing of the various unions affiliated with
this council have been made, desires to place
itself before the public in a true light. Mem
bership comprises all trades Interested in the
metal industry of this city, nearly numbering
2500 mechanics and about the same number of
helpers and apprentices. The council has in
augurated such a perfect system of registration
that each individual can within two hours' time
be brought to our headquarters. Notwithstand
ing statements made to the contrary, we can
unhesitatingly assert and are prepared to prove
that there have been no desertions from our
ranks. These trades realizing that â¢ those . in
terests are mutual have banded themselves to
gether under one head, known as the Ban
Francisco Iron Trades Council.

Presently another man came in. "Well.
Bill, did you stake that claim in Snow

VYes, that, will make a good contest. The
writing - on the old stakes could scarcely be
read, 'bo I removed them."
'Â¦'Well, here Is another you must visit to-day.

OAKLAND, June 5.â A startling
feature of the Aegis, ' the annual
student publication of the Oak
land High School, just issued, is
a thinly veiled expose of the
Nome receivership scandals, under the
puise of a storiette entitled "Demons of
tho Gold Fiejds," in which the principal
characters, named "McKenney" and
"Boyes," are an obvious substitution ' for
Alexander McKenzie and his attorney.
Dubose. The story Is by Professor E. F.
Burrill, head of the Greeek department
of the Oakland High School, who sjpent
a year at Nome and was in the north
when the receivership troubles occurred.
Professor Burrill was asked for a contri
bution to the annual, and in response to
the request of Carl Hoffman, one of the
editors,- handed him a little later the man
uscript of the "Demons of the Gold
Fields," remarking, "That's pretty near
the inside situation." Â¦ , ' Â¦
The story opens with a scene in the
cabin of a Nome-bound ocean steamer
crowded with prospectors. At a table,
apart from the crowd, three men are sit
tingâ "McKinney.". his attorney, "Boyes/
and "Dufrasne," a Nome miner, who is
displaying a big nugget from his rich
claim. So -far he had kept his own coun
sel about his property, but now he is get
ting talkative. He is finally asked the
number of his claim. The tale runs:
"Number 10 on Dexter," answered Dufrasne,
whose tongue had been limbered with liquor
at the other's expense. "That's . nothing,"
went on Dufrasne volubly. "I can sro out on
my claim every morning: before breakfast and
pick up a whole basketfull ,of nugsÂ«ts like
"But what are you fellers going to do?" he
continued. "What are all these people on this
boat going to do? Think there's anything left
for Uiem?" ' â¢ . <
"Oh. we shall do a thing or two ourselves,"
replied McKinney. laughing. "What was the
Nome Consolidated Mining Company organized
in New York for; and what is the Nome Court
for. eh, Boyes?"
"Hush. McKinney," whispered Boyes, warn
lng-ly,' for his tongue also was getting a' bit
limber. '. 'Â¦Â¦"-, Â¦ 'â¢
Dufrasne burst into a guffaw. . "You duffers
make me laugh. Think we fellers who were
the first at the crib left anything for you?
Not if we know it."
"Perhaps you don't," retorted McKinney.
Not deisrningr " to notice this remark. Du
frasne, with a swaggering; air, pocketed the
nugget and staggered out of the room.
McKinney took out his pocketbook and mefle
a merrcrandum.' "That's a pretty good claim
to be receiver of? What do you think, Boyes?"
Scene Shifts to Home.,
The next step of the conspiracy is de
picted in a scene between Boyes and one
of his henchmen at- Nome. . The lawyer
Is seated in his office poring over a map

"The people here only know of one of

court's action. Â¦ There -Â» were others at

bution to the Aegis because I believed It

This year's Aegis is an advance over Its
predecessors. The book â¢ is adorned with
art work by professional and student tal
ent and profusely illustrated with half

' Professor Burrill said of the story:
"While I changed the circumstances of,

stantially correctl I was on the ( ground

that : no rights were ; respected- in Nome
that year. *The characters in my. story
Â¦were. not the only organized sang of rob
bers. ,
is that it was written in the heat of passion
and without due consideration. I note that
you say that IJjave "transcended my author
ity" and that a - Governor Cannot compel a
member of the United States Senate to hold his
office and exercise the functions of that office
if he chooses to surrender it" and that you de
cline 'Â¦ for the present to withdraw your resig
nation. : . i ; â¢ " . '
; Had you read carefully my letter addressed to
you and to Senator McLaurin you must have
seen that I did not express any desire to com
pel any member of the United States Senate to
hold his commission and exercise the func
tions of that office If he choose to surrender it.
My sole purpose in . returning the resignation
was to ask you gentlemen to consider Â¦ calmly
and thoughtfully the consequences to the peo
'pie of . what Â¦ I judged to be a hasty act and
what you admit to have been a hasty, act. and
I must confess that' I am - somewhat surprised
fft the tone of â¢ your answer to my request. I
considered the course which I took in ' this
matter to be for the best interest of the peo
ple of South Carolina and I am responsible to
them alone for. my action, and furthermore I
still believe that my course has met the ap
proval of a majority- of the citizens' of "the
State, .nor. do I consider them unthinking, citi
zens, but men who know and recognize as ful
ly as any people on earth the rights and duties
and responsibilities of citizenship, and who do'
not need the services of 'any one to tell them
their duty. '. . " '
Your insinuation that - 1 have been "impor
tuned", to "await the convenience',' of any pres
ent or would-be aspirants "who are not ready
Just yet for various reasons to enter the con
test brought on so unexpectedly," and that for
this reason my action has taken the direction
it has, is unworthy of a' man holding the hierh
commission which has been given you by the
people of South Carolina, -and deserves no
notice in this connection. However. I may say
for your benefit that I alone am responsible for
my reply, and will give account for the course
I ; have taken to the people who have honored
me, and not to any one individual. In this mat
ter I have done what I thought best -calculated
to promote the proiferity and contentment of
' the people of my. State, and shall continue to
do so, regardless of what any one man may
say or think of my course. Â¦ â¢ * â¢
I did not think that a political campaign this
summer could do any good, and acted according
to my belief. However, had the resignations
been unconditional and unrestricted, my action
might have been otherwise. With due respect
for your opinion, I think I have as high a. con
ception of the office of Senator and its powers
as you or any other citizen of this State, and
you must have known that the brief interview
to which you refer meant that I would simply
meet the responsibility and perform my duties
under the conditions. , If .you still wish to re
sign your commission and will send to this of
fice an unconditional resignation, ' I will exer
cise the authority and power vested in me by
the people. Respectfully, etc.. â¢ j â¢

Senator Tillman. protesting against the
Governor's right to reject the v Senatorial
resignations, to-night withdrew his resig
nation. In his letter to . . Governor Mc-
Sweeney Senator Tillman said: '
: I have Senator McLaurin" s communication. In
which he graciously consents, at 'your request,
to hold on to his commission as United ' States
Senator, and continue to serve the State as he
has done in the past.' to the best of his ability.
This leaves me one of three alternatives â to ap
peal to the Democratic executive Committee
to take the matter up and determine what the
best interests of the party require to be done;
to appeal to the Senate itself to â¢ determine
whether a resignation from I that body to take
effect at some future time is binding, or to
Â¦withdraw my own reslgrnatloit ,My chief â¢ re
gret is that I am forced by your action to
engage in what the outside world will consider
a game of opera bouffe, by withdrawing from
the combined resignation . after â¢ Senator I Mc-
Laurin's undignified and puerile action; but the
purpose for which it was. tendered has been
thwarted by Senator MclÂ«aurln's precipitous
acceptance of executive advice.. Bob Acres has
been outdone for once. - I have already said . I
had no motive or purpose in resigning except
to force McLaurin' s resignation, and there is
nothing for me to do - but to accept the sit
uation and withdraw my own resignation, i if
it be lawful for me to do so. --â¢. â

Last night there was a reception and
social to the grand officers and delegates
in the Alcazar building. There was a
musical and vaudeville programme and a
dance. The affair was under the direc
tion of Mrs. E. J. Sinclair, floor manager,
assisted by Mrs. B. Harris, Mrs. A. Levy,
Mrs. Schonone, Miss Rappin and Mr. Mar
tin, assisted by Mrs. M. Connell and M
Levy. > â¢
The election of grand officers was made
the special order for 2:30 o'clock tills
afternoon. . â¢
The presiding officer appointed J. J.
Cordy, M. Levy, M. Brady, Mrs. Emma
Agnes Harrington and Miss Agnes D.
Bremer a committee on revision of the
constitution and laws.
To authorize the Grand Circle to re
instate innocent members who belonged
to a circle suspended for cause; that non
past chief companions of subordinate cir
cles shall not be eligible to be members
of the Grand Circle before they have been
members of the order for six months;
that financial officers shall not be in
stalled until after the filing of bonds;
that the grand treasurer shall file a bond
within ten days after election; that any
past grand chief companion may install
grand officers; that a visiting board be
created and that the State be divided
into four districts for official visitations;
that district deputies visit circles once a
month.
During the afternoon there were a num
ber of amendments adopted, as follows:
The report of Grand Financial Secre
tary Miss Agnes D. Bremer shows that
the increase in membership for the year
was 746 up to January 1, at which time
the members numbered 2002. Since then
the order has increased to 2300.
The grand sub-chief companion in her
report, which is an interesting document
for members of the. order, suggests that
all circles adopt a uniform rate of fees,
so as to include free medicine, doctor
and a cash benefit to members: that steps
be taken to extend the order; that, in
view of the Increased duties, the salary
of the grand financial secretary be in
creased; that a small tax be set aside
for the entertainment of grand officers
and delegates to the Grand Circle; that
deputies should not be chosen for circles
of which they are not members when
such can be avoided, and that public
meetings be called to diffuse the prin
ciples of the order. In closing she thanks
those who assisted her during the year,
and specially mentions The Call for no
tices of the Companions of the Forest of
America.
I have only a few recommendations to offer.
I would recommend that the executive coun
cil always work in a spirit of harmony and
peace, for the future success of our beloved
order depends on the unity and harmony that
should prevail at headquarters. .
The deputies should not only be instructed
but let them know that it is an imperative duty
to eee that the officers-elect are duly qualified
in their ritualistic work, especially the chief
companion and sub- chief companion.
The Grand Circle of the Companions of
the Forest of America met in fourteenth
annual convention in Elks' Hall yester
day morning. The meeting was called
to order by Grand Sub-Chief Companion
Miss Alice Ticoulet, in the absence of
Grand Chief Companion Mrs. Katie Agee.
All the delegates and the other grand
officers were present except the outside
guard. Mrs. A. Levy, of Martha Wash
ington Circle, was appointed sub-chief
companion, and Mrs. A. Lippi, of Lorely
Circle, was appointed outside guard. .
- The reports of grand officers were re
ferred to the committee on distribution.
The report of the grand chief com
panion was read. It concludes: f
The state of the order is in every way pros- ;
perous and all that could be desired, and I am
pleased to note that tliere has been a vast in
crc-ase in members-hip during the last year, for '
which I feel very thankful.
1 do emphatically state, under this bead, that
if the brothers of the Courts of Foresters of
America gave the substantial backing and
hearty co-operation to this branch of Forestry
that it merits and deserves, it would be the
greatest benevolent secret society in the world
to-day, but I must say that I believe the broth
er Foresters are waking up to the fact slowly
a iid surely, for the. latter part of my term as
your chief executive I found them taking a
more active interest than at first.

GRAND CIRCLE
IN ELKS' HALL
J^ re Norlne Schneider will be per
muted to testify against "Sir" Harry
Cooper it must be proven to
the satisfaction of the court that ehe Is
not legally his wfie. Such was the de
cision which was definitely handed down
>es.erday by Judge Carroll Cook when
Attorney Eugene Deuprey attempted to
nave admitted as evidence her testimony
concerning the alleged telegram* upon
Wh -, h sne y* el ded her hand and heart.
The impaneling: of the Jury was com
pleted in the early part of the afternoon
and the case was immediately com
menced. The jury is made up as follows:
J. P. Stieerln. 2316 Geary street; P. J. Galla
gher. 452 Octavla; D. E. Hayden, 606 OFarrell;
J. H. Holllng. 1814 Geary; Joseph Baumgarten,
4 Montgomery; F. H. Gibson. 604 Baker; J. P.
Kekland. 593 Oary; H. K. Waterhouse. 247 San
Carles avenue; ii. Ruegg, US Geary; G. M.
Cowie. Ml Sixth; A. Jackson. 615B Mason.
The first witness called for the prose
cution was T. H. Reynolds of the West
ern Lnion Telegraph Company, who icien
'ifced the telegram which Norine Schnei
fi*r had received as one which had been
sent to the main office from one of the
branch cfSces. The telegTam was admit
ted, for identification. Air. Reynolds also
identified the relay copy of the message,
Â¦which was also introduced for identifica
tion.
He was followed by Miss Julia A.
Smith, manager of the Western Union
Telegraph ofhee at 100 ilarket street, who
identified the telegram and testified that
she had received and transmitted it. She
was unable, however, to identify the per-
Fon who had written it. Attorney Deu
prey requested that she look around. the
courtroom to see if she could discover
any one who resembled the person who
had sent the message. She could not.
Miss Ada Bertch of the main office was
next summoned to the *tand. She also
identified the telegram and relay mes>
f age. upon which Deuprey moved to have
them admitted as evidence, but this was
refused on the ground that it had not
been shown that the defendant in any
manner had been connected with them.
They were returned to the clerk's keep-
In? for further identification.
Then came the forensic battle of the
day. Norine Schneider took the witness
stand. Fcr the first few moments all
went serenely. She admitted having met
the defendant at Vallejo Junction on Jan
uary 23 and having been married to him
by the Rev. Mr. Travis. At that time.
fhe claimed, she was not aware that he
had been previously married.
At this point Attorney Murphy, who is
conducting Cooper's case, objected to Miss
Schneider being asked any further ques
tions, on the ground that the admission
that Fhe had been married to the defend
ant excluded her from testifying against
him. Attorney Deuprey argued strenu
ously against the point, but Judge Cook
decided that excepting in cases of crimi
nal violence a wife and a husband are
incompetent to testify against each other.
He admonished Deuprey that it was in
cumbent upon him to introduce evidence
that Xorine is not "Sir Harry's" wife.
Xorine Schneider's mother was then
called and denied having sent any tele
pram to her daughter on January 23 or
having authorized any one to do so. She
testified that on the eventful day she had
met Harry Westwood Cooper on the
Oakland boat and that she had gone to
lunch with him at an O'Farrell street
restaurant. Previous to the marriage
this was the last time she had seen him.
An adjournment was then taken until 10
o'clock this morning. â¢ '

School ma'ams have troubles of their

The right selection of food will cure
dyspepsia and many other disorders of
the body.

from stomach trouble for years and with-
out being able to find food that would
agret with her, she finally was Induced, to
try Grape-Nuts. The trouble with gas and
nervousness, coming from indigestion, dis-
appeared, and her own testimony says: "I
gained in flesh bo much that now I am
heavier and better than I have ever been
during the eight years I have .taught

"My stomach does not cause me the

The, Investigation by. Secretary White of
thÂ« Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children In regard to the abduction of
Joseph Clifford from a charitable Institu
tion in this city, has revealed the fact that
another boy -was taken at' the same time
and by : the : same parties: ; Roy Taylor,
the second boy. -'.left -with Clifford for
school " on April 3 and no trace has been
found of either of them since that day. >
Mrs. Clifford ' of Oakland ' and . Mrs. - Tay
lor of San Bruno, the mothers of the chil
dren, have spared no trouble or expense in
an effort to find them and both are heart
broken at the discouraging results of their
search. Secretary White states that he
heard from the authorities at Merced that
Mrs. Sllva, the natural mother of the Clif
ford boy, "brought him there, but as a re
sult of a quarrel with the man with whom
she was living, she took-. the child away
the. next day. Â¦--Â¦â¢.-Â¦ â¢ Â¦
It has . also been learned that a friend
of * the grandmother- of the â¢ Clifford boy,
while riding â¢ in a carriage with , a negro
woman in Oakland last'Sunday, confessed
that she; was concerned with the grand
mother in ; stealing, the two ' children in
April. : Her story, will be investigated and
the two 'boys will be recovered if possible.

Dr. J. JF. ttlBBOX. sail Francisco, CaL ITHE fifth national convention of
railroad commissioners opened in
the Marble Hall of the Palace
Hotel yesterday * morning and
commenced business â¢with a dis
cussion on enlarging*! the membership,
which lasted Into the afternoon session.
Under the call State ofQcers charged
with the supervision of railroads were
requested to be present, and in that con
nection the status of Alva E. Taylor, as
sistant Attorney General of South Da
kota, who in that State is adviser to the
railroad commissioners, came up for dis
cussion. It was finally decided that^ his
position was merely advisory and so* he
was not entitled to membership.
A resolution providing that civil en
gineers connected with State Railroad
Commissions should be eligible 'to mem
bership was referred to the' committee
on organization . and programme. ,The
committee did not: include the engineers
As defined by the committee and ratified
by the convention, the membership will- in
clude the members of the Interstate Com
merce Commission, the secretary, assist
ant-secretary, and statistician of the In
terstate Commerce Commission, members
of the State Railroad Commissions or
their deputies, or, in . the absence of a
State railroad commission, such State of
ficers as are charged with the supervision
of railroads, and the secretaries or chief
clerks of railroad commissioners.- . The
representatives of the steam and street
railway accounting associations are-in
cluded as members Â¦ with a voice in ; all
business, but with a vote only in- such
business as affects their own associations.
Also all former members of f the body
whose terms of office â¢may have expired
when it I made its report â¢ on membership.
A minority report included the engineers,
but the majority report . prevailed: it
was decided- also -that statisticians of
State Railroad Commissions could :,. not
become members, J and neither could - rep
resentatives appointed by Governors : un
less they were eligible otherwise.' -
I" The report of the committee on classi
fication of operating and construction ex
penses of electric street railways was first
on the order of business. The report was
read- by Lavant M. Read of Vermont. The
substance of the report was a suggestion
that a committee be appointed to formu
late some plan of report from electrlo
reads by which the expenses could be seg
rej?8ted and classified. . .'
Â¦ The committee on grade crossings made
a report," which was read by Ashley W.
Cole of New York. It reviewed the.ef
forts of the various States to secure-cross
ings above or below the track line and of
the various schemes to assist or to compel
the railroads to put such crossings in.' The
advantages. in time saved, more apparent
on the suburban roads than on the main
lines, were commented upon, and figures
of expense in changing > crossings from
grade to above or below 'were submitted.
It was suggested that some uniform plan
for the elimination of Â¦' all grade crossings
be adopted. The- law of- Connecticut,
which . requires that at least. . one : grade
crocsing in every sixty miles of track be
dene away with in each year, was cited
as an example of one way in which 1 the
evil could be abated. Grade crossing's were
condemned as a menace . to the - life . of
the passengers on the: train : and on .the
travelers on the crossing road; a .strain
uion the engineer and the train crew;*a
cause of needless delay and 'â¢ a source . of
expense , to railroads â¢ . through . ' damage
suits, that might soon eat up the cost of a
proper crossing. â¢ The subject was.thor
oughly discussed, ; but no' definite- action
was taken on any of the suggestions made
in the report except to adopt it. Â¦ . . â¢ -Â¦Â¦ Â¦ :-â¢:
| A programme for the days the visitors
will spend in California was submitted by
the committee on Â¦Â¦ arrangements and was
adopted by the convention. . It Includes a
Reports of Committees.
-The address of the chairman contained
three suggestions. He \ suggested that
some' afction bo tatoen to make uniform
the regulations governing Â£ grade cross
ings; that a committee on constitution
and by-laws be appointed, and that the
railroad commissioners : of - : Canada " and
Mexico be invited to send delegates - to
the convention at future sessions. The
suggestion regarding ' the committee on
constitution and by-laws > was acted upon
at. once, and - the chairman appointed
Charles A. Prouty, of the Interstate
Commerce Commission; Sam L. Rogers,
of North Carolina; "Robert P. Graham, of
Maryland ; . Isaac B. Brown, of Pennsyl
vania; ; W." G. Smith, of South Dakota;
E. G. Akers, of Â¦Virginia, and Lavant M.
Read, of Vermont, to. form the commit
tee. It will report to this session of the
convention.
Â¦It was then that the discussion on mem
berBhip took place, and the reference of
the matter to the committee on organiz
ation , and programme. There was some
discussion bb to who should vote on the
question; but the â¢ chairman, Cicero J.
Lindly, ruled that only those considered
eligible by the last convention, held in St.
Louis, could vote on the question of mem
bership. . â¢ Â¦
Charles S. Laumeister, Railroad Com:
missioner of â¢ California, welcomed the
visitors to the city and State. James W.
Datta of Pennsylvania responded.

-Sheriff Hall of Plumas County has been
in the city for a day or two and he took
charge of the young wife.. He will* take
her back to her home when he leaves this
morning with Stamm. . She Is Â«.. quiet,

implicitly in the Innocence of, her hus
band. - - Â« tvr.; '."
Stamm la accused of committing the
hcld-up of John Welch, station agent for
the . Sierra Valley Railway at Clairville,
Plumas County. On the night of May
25 a man knocked at the door of the sta
tion house, where. Welch was sleeping,
and In answer to Welch's inquiry said
that he wanted to use the telephone to
call up a doctor, as his partner was sick.
Welch opened the door and was confront
ed - by a masked man with i a revolver in
his ; hand. He compelled Welch to open
the safe and hand him $200. all the money
that was in it. - Part of it belonged to the
Wells-Farg-o Company, Welch also acting
as agent for them.
'Detective Hume of Wells-Fargo, who
has been working on the case, claims that
Stamm is the robber. He says he has
traced his movements since . May 23.
Stamm, be says, left San Francisco on
that day for Truckee. On the . following
day he ( hired a rig there and drove to
within four miles west of Clairville,
where he camped in the ' brush till the
evening of May 25. "; He cut the telephone
wires and drove to a point about one mile
east of Clairville, where he also cut the
telephone wires. He drove back to within
half a mile of Clairville, hitched his horse
and walked into town, where he held up
Welch. He drove back to Truckee, ar
riving May 26 and leaving at 2 o'clock the
next morning on the west-bound train for
Oroville. May 28 he hired a team at Oro
ville and drove to Quincy, Plumas Coun
ty, reaching there May 29. The following
day he was married by the minlater, of
the Methodist Episcopal church to "Pet"
Shlnn, the young daughter of < a ; miner
living about five miles from Quincy. That
evening with his bride he left for Oro
ville, arriving there on May 31.. June 2
he left i Orovllle with his bride for this
city, stopping off at Sacramento. All this
is the detective's statement.
Stamm denies his guilt and claims that
he will be able to prove an alibf. but De
tective Hume is just as positive that he
Is the right man. Hume measured
Stamm" s feet in the prison, as marks of
footsteps were discovered after. the rob
bery leading from the station house to a
buggy, and Starom's feet correspond with
the marks according to size. '
Edward J. Stamm. a miner's laborer,
about 40 years of age, was arrested on
Market street, near Grant avenue, yes
terday morning by Detectives Whittaker
and McMahon and locked up at the City
Prison. . His bride of a week was . with
him at the time and she accompanied him
to the. prison.
