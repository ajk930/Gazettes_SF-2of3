It came to him as a result of his
personal experiences with Li Hung
Chang. In the year 1895, when the
â¢war with Japan was being given its
finishing touches, Li was obliged to
go to Japan to conclude negotiations,
and he took Chamot with him as in
terpreter. From that time dates the
friendship. In Ilarch, you will re
member, the war drew to a close. To
Shimcnoseki Li set eff, accompanied
by his secretary, W. M. Pettick, and
his interpreter.
On the 24th of March he attended
a peace conference with Count Ito
and Viscount Mutan. They were ths
peace plenipotentiaries who were set
tling affairs for the Mikado. The con
ference passed smoothly and all
seemed going well when the attack
occurred which came near starting
over again the contest of two warring
nations.
Li was in a carriage returning to
his lodging, when Hoynma Eokuno- 1
suki, a miserable fanatic, a man who
had been known as belonging to the
criminal classes and had been impris- .
cned for previous crime, shot him.
The bullet penetrated tha left cheek'
a centimeter below the eye, and made *
a wound three centimeters deep. *
Li was taken to his lodgings and
there was a great ado. The Emperor
sent regards, the Empress sent twa <
nurses. Surgeons Sato and Ishimuro i

to care for the distinguished guest, j
They wanted to probe for the bullet
and announced their intention.
Chamot translated to ILL Xii half
arose from his couch, which was the
most he could do, and raised a storm
of protest.
"I 'will not permit it!" he cried,
end his words were translated.
"But " began Dr. Sato. '
"But " echoed Dr. Ishimuro.
"I will not permit it!" shouted 11 \
again, and again Chamot translated, j
The difficulties Chamot went through 1
between those doctors and the stub- <
born patient were nacre than anybody '
can imagine. For a long time Li held
out and could not be persuaded to ,
have the bullet probed for. He was
afraid of the instruments, doubting <
their cleanness.
Chemot endeavored to explain, xs
did others, and in time Li came to ,
see that risking an operation would
fce for his best good. Through all the <
tedious process of his recovery Li and

When young Holden had been upon.the
Hawaiian island for a period that seemed
to him about ten months, for he; had "no
means of gauging the flight of time, the'
three chiefs that seemed to have most to
do with him decided that he should be tat
tooed in order to be more like Vthemselvcs
and so that he could never get away from
the tribe. Holden did not know what was
to be done when he was stretched out: on
the grass by a dozen powerful kanakas
nnd tied prone to posts and trees ho that
he could not move a muscle. In vain he
tried to tell as best he could in : the mew
tongue that he would servo his masters
â¢always and never murmur If he ( might be
spared the new ordeal of, wholesale tat
tooing. All his body, except his hands,
face and feet, were subjected to tattooing.
An Indelible fluid/obtained . from a," tropl- ~l
cal plant like the indigo.: was used.'Doz
ens of. tattooing Instruments, â¢- all having .-'
sets of, minute thorns and prickers In dlf-"
ferent forms, were used. There were mil
lions of pricks into the flesh. One hideous
design alone on Holden's ; shoulder re
quired seven days of physical anguish and
tens of thousands of flesh ; punctures.
Every other day for seven months the
tattooing of the white man proceeded..
ordeals with the fingernails. _ Occasion
ally he was lacerated by a kanaka cuttlnc
at his inviting bare back, but when the
savage joke grew ancient and he showed
that he accepted, his unhappy lot .with
resignation and . that he could - eat raw
fish and rotting vegetables the 'same as
his swarthy captors, he%was treated more
considerately. Â¦ : # "." 'Â¦'.:
awoke to the pain of a consuming fire.
He never believed he could recover from
the agony of the raging, burning cuticle
all over his body. Ills master, the chief,
came and looked at him and ordered sev
eral women, to attend to the suffering
man, but they were so curious to observe
the agony of sunburn on a whtto man's
pkln that they were only a source of an
noyance and petty torture rather thanUn
aid to the sufferer.
In a week young Holden's pain was past
and a new and delicately tender cuticle
began to form. The black natives 'came
in swarms to see him and observe what
was to them an extraordinary thingâ the
formation of a new white skin-. One morn-
Ing, when Holden waa lying on his face
and stomach, weak and discouraged, a
party of Jabbering kanakas sat about
curiously observing the only white man
they had ever seen. Suddenly one of tha
kanakas sneaked over to the outstretched,
drowsy Holdcn and with his long, hawk
like fingernails, sharp as razors. on both,
hands, scraped away at one sweep down
the body the tender flesh from the neck
to the knees. If redhot Irons had been
slowly drawn down the body of the young
man it would not have been more agoniz
ing than were the eight bleeding stripes
of raw, quivering flesh that the kanaka's
fingernails left. -'iV'V â¢-â¢-Â¦<--.-<
The kanakas roaret. and Ehouted at the
humor of the thing, and for months after
ward Holden . would see them imitating
his agony at that time, while knots of
spectators laughed , and laughed - Even
little boys used to Imitate Hftlden's dread
ful pain at the time his tender cuticle was
torn away In strips by the kanaka.
When the young castaway had recov
ered from his sunburn and lacerated
wounds*' ahd a new skin had been formed
he wa^ kept busy, while. off duty from
work dodging stones and clubs â¢ that were
thrown at him to create fun for the dusky
populace. He was ever watchful lest,'un

". of the Hawaiian group. Captain Cook
antedated Mr. Holden forty-one years, but
Captain Cook never spent more than a
few weeks on either of his two visits in
the archipÂ»Iago. The story of the life that
Mr. Holden led among his dusky captors,
the manner of his appearance among the
Hawiians and his final escape from them
Â¦ are as Interesting as a chapter from
â¢â¢Robinson Crusoe" or "Swiss Family
nobir.son."
Horace Holden is white haired and
fqfeb'c. He has lived quietly in Salem for
thirty years and is known by thousands
of people here ; Very few people who have
met this apod, quiet, modest man daily for
years on the streets there have any idea
of what extraordinary experiences have
been his. and no story writer has yet
known what a volume of thrilling tales
migV.t be formed from the adventures Mr.
Holden has had. Mr. Ho!den was born in
a little viUage in New Hampshire In June,
1S10. Â¦Ho was a sailor by Instinct.- and
from his earliest boyhood his dreams and
as-piratlons were all cf the sea and life in
strange lands r.cioss.the broad ocean. In
3*2?. the year he was IS. he went on hi*
first long voyage. "With the famous old
whaler, the stanch Mentor, he salleJ out
Â¦cf the great port of Bedford, Mass., one
October day. The crew were all experi
enced whalers and had been with the.
Maxtor almost from pole to pole In pur
suit of whale oil and whalebone. Now
they were embarked for a two years* voy
cge around the Horn and up the Pacific
Coast. Young Holden eagerly accepted
the chance to sail on the whaling voyage
tnd to see new parts of the world. That
was ten years before Richard Henry Dana
ealled from New Bedford and made the
voyage so famous in his "Two Years Be
fore the Mast."
The whaling ship rounded the Horn !n
January. 1S29. and proceeded up the ccast
toward the whaling fields in the North
Pcdflc The voyage proceeded without
incident until one densely dark night.
May 21, 1S2S. when the Mentor, while in a
terrific storm, was tossed upon a ledge of
rocks. Later it was found that the rocks
were Immense coral reefs. The shin tra?
wrecked and everything on board was
lost, and | all the" crew but two were
washed away ar.d drowned In the rearing.
Fiirgir.g sea. In some unaccountable way*
yrung Horace Holden and a fellow-sailor
Â¦were carried to a coral reef projecting
above the water. When daylight came
the famished, drenched and terrified men
mw tfcat they were within sight of land.
.All that Â£ay they clung to the coral. At
FiiTiret a dr.zen long, canoelike boats, pad
dled by naked, yelling savages, came out
to Holden and his companion. The coffee
colored men had seen the Â¦wreck and had
mm* out to look it over more closely.
The two sailors were taken to one of thÂ«
Islands of the Hawaiian group. The par
t'cular Island Mr. Holden believes was
Hilo. from the descriptions he has sineÂ»
read cf that island. Thousands of the
rude natives were on the shore 'when the
tnvÂ» white men landed there from a canoe.
Hrr-at excitement wa? created among th?
*avage?. and thÂ» news that there were
two real !ive white men on thÂ» island was
'carried to th* Iribes inland. For days Mr.
Holden and his companion were regarded
with ir.tonse timidity and curiosity. The
I!awal:ai:s came and lived near the
Tnen with "-hlto skins so as to satisfy
their curiosity concerning the habits and
mode of !ifo amonc the wonderful stran
gers. Great throngs of native men and
women, nimcst rss nude ss the day they
were born, wovld feel the flesh of the
white oaptives. pinch the white skin an-i
twirl the fine hair In their fingers to see
whether it was all natural. Children In
droves viewed Holden and his companion
â¢ from safe distances and ran screamlnz
to their mothers Ir the white men moved
toward them. The srreater part of the
Islanders paied Â¦with superstitious wonder
"at young Holden and his companion, and
In order to make the captives like them
selves they tore the clothing from the
young men and left them to run naked as
themselves. The young Americans never
went otherwise during their long stay on
the Hawaiian island.
TVhen the curiosity wore away and the.
superstitious wonder of the natives had
.turned to contempt, because the white
men were not so agile at tree climbing
and enduring in aquatic feats as them-
Bdres, the natives began a series of hor
rible abuses upon the poor prisoners. whr>
were terrified lest any act of theirs or
Bcrae untoward circumstance might anger
the dusky savages to murder ahd canni
balism.
( For weeks and months Halden and hi?
companion never slept at the samel time.
They were ceaselessly watchful of the
savages. One always feigned Bleep, but
kept awake, fearing that some horrible
fate was In store fcr both of them. The
Hawaiian*, however, probably never had
any thought of making food of the whita
men, but rather to make ihem providers
cf food. AH manner of tricks to worry
and torment the castaways .were prac
ticed. Stones and missiles would be
thrown at the two men, and when the
latter would run and- dodge Â«nd scramble
out of range as beet they, could the Ha
waiians would roll and scream with
laughter. Holden and his companion,
nude as they alwayn were, would be tied
to trees where mosquitoes and gnats werÂ«s
numerous and the Kanaka women and
children would sit for hours reveling in
the scene of two -vJ.Ite. men Jabbering, in
a tongue unknown to them and squirming
and wriggling at the stlnge of a cloud
of insect*. It took weeks before H*olden
could eat the food of the natives, but
rather than starve he became an adept at
<ating raw mullet right from the water,
and of rolling li\-e :><iui<l flesh under his
tongue. ' His companion, however, slck
:*<ened and wasted away under the treat
ment he tiad at the hands of the natives,
and one # day he was found dead on the
f eashore. where he hud crawled to take a
long farewell look acro.-s the waters to
tvhrre he imagined was his home.
Along with about fine hundred and fifty
other slavesâ black-Â«kinned men, wlio had
be*n taken in recent warfare on some ad
jacent Islandâ Holden was set at .work in
a taro field, owned by a chief, whom the
white young man had been taught was
his master. The heat* under the fierce
tropic sun in the interior- of the lslar.3
almost roasted Itoidcn. In- vain he mo
tioned to the dusky boss, who sat In tho
shade r.ear at Â£anj and watched the
slaves work, that he was suffering under
the Intense heat, bat the Hawaiian only
grinned derisively and* ordered the white
man back to his task. '
In two days Holden'g body was scorched
and burred to such a degree that" It doea
. not seem any one could have been so sun
burned and outlived it. He was carried
unconscious to a spring and thrown in
ihe shade of palms. There the cool breezes

At", last, "when ' he ": could ' . not ' hold hjj

by i doing. so, .and when his brain seemed
on fire from the long imprisonment under
water, he came . to the ; surface of the
ocean. 1 It was a marvelous feat He was
out of range of the greatest' spearman in
the Sandwich Islands." ' For a few minutes
he paddled , slowly,: about -. until ';; he could
breathe." Then he yelled to the sailors In
the rowboat. They pulled toward him and
he was hauled, "exhausted , and * almost
fainting into Â¦ the boat.- The kanakas In
the proa, seeing this, paddled swiftly. back
tojshore. ... ' , ," . ', .'Â¦Â¦/. .
Half dead with ; excitement at his deliv
erance and exhaustion . from ' his supreme
effort in diving, young Holden was carried
on board the ship, which proved to be the
Britannia, In the i English merchant ser
vice.' t' Holden -was shorn of his locks and
whiskers^arid^ became 'a -pet of the fore
castle. His stories^ of , his adventures on
the strange island of the Sandwich group
always i had an ' audience. . It waa on Oc
tober 20, \ 1834, that he was ' taken aboard
the Britannia. ;; 1 1 was the ! first ' calandar
day for. month' he Â¦ had' known in ' his five
and a half years among the kanakas. He
went to Llntln, s China,. on. the Britannia.
There i he ; shipped ; for. Cadiz. Spain, and
from % there ? to % New k York. 1 ; He i reached
New Bedford early In 'the'" summer of. 1835,
nearer Holden was able to call in English
to them, and be says he almost swooned
with delight to hear his own tongue
spoken In reply. None of the kanakas,
who sat open mouthed and wondering
near him in the proa, understood a word
of English.
"Come nearer. I am a poor castawa'y
sailor and I want you to Bave me from
these savages," he shouted, when he knew
he could be iieard. .
"We don't want to.be speared, by those
devils in the canoe with you," one of the
sailors returned.
Holden urged the sailors to come a little
nearer and make a sudden demonstration
against, the savages, while he could escape
to the sailors' boat, but the sailors did not
want to risk their lives against the pois
oned spears, besides all .sailors knew th<i
frightful fate that befell' Captain James
Cook and his crew on the Â¦ shore of the
Sandwich Islands.
The ship signaled the yawl to return.
Hoi den saw the signal. ''"His -heart) beat
fast and his brain whirled. . He realized
it wa3 . then or never. ' He i was doomed
to a lifetime of barbarism and slavery, on
a lonely ' island If - he let another minute
ways with empty pockets. No. questions
are asked. What would be the use? '
The corpse is left at the morgue for a
day or two, then, if it is unclaimed, it is
burled in the potter's plat and the un
known suicide is forgotten.
And what point of view does the rescued
suicide take of life, and what are the
thoughts of the ."man overboard"?
Only those who have come back from
the watery grave can tell us.
An old German who was rescued says:
"It's a most lonely feelingâ and the fer
ry-boat so far awav, and It's a poor way
for a good swimmer to try to die."
After his plunge the German immediate
ly struck out for the beat! But he says
he felt as though he had weights on his
feet. His heavv shoes and clothes became
water-soaked, and he was, picked up by
the ferry going the other way, which got
to him first.
He was taken to the County Hospital,
and next morning he wanted to know if
the account of his attempted suicide was
in the paper, "because,", he saldj "I want
her to read it."
A drunk- who Jumped. overboard was In
stantly sobered. He said when he looked
back at the ferry he wanted to come back
and live some iriore. .
"And' It's Tterrlble cold, arid the boat; Is
so slow and you can get so tired!" he
complained. â¢ - . Â¦. ,
Verily, one of the effects of drink Is to
make the entire universe center around
the drunk!
But one young woman who was rescued
is grateful to her rescuers.
"She jumped from â¢ the Â¦ ferry-boat . and
was going under for - the ' third and last
time when we pot her. I shall never forget
her screams," says the second mate,
whose duty It is to take the body. In .'over
the stern of the lifeboat.'
"A woman : suicide always screams," he
says, "and the suicide scream is different
from anything you ever heard. Sometimes
I hear It in my dreams. It Is terrible!"
Years of experience ha vo ; trained the
crew and the wharfmen to size up a
would-be suicide at sight.
The woman who comes on board In a
crying and nervous condition is watchel
from the time she leaver till the time sha
lands.
Perhaps the wharfhand notices her
first; then he says to the deckhani.
"Watch her!".;
A drunken man usually talks about what
he Is going to do and then he can be
Â¦watched and headed 'off.
Then, again, ' so varied are the forms
of human nature that the man with sui
cidal Intentions In his *ieart Is no different
sometimes in outward appearances froia
the ordinary commuter.
One old fellow once Daced the deck
leisurely and enioked his pipe; then he
went over to the side of the boat and put
his foot on the rail and grasped the post
Â¦ for support. .
"You're riot going overboard, old man,
ere you?" 1 asked the deckhand.
"No." said the* old fellow. "That would
be a; shame. Better struggle along with
life. Don't you think *o?'"
"Yes," said the deckhand, and as he
turned he ; heard a sarcastic laugh and
then a splash. The poor old inan's strug
gles, with life were over. He jumped from
the forward deck and was probably hit
by the wheel and Instantly killed, for his
body; was never found.
â¢,'Good-by.. ladles." called a stole, as he
Jumped from the ' upper forward deck.
"It's lip to you." ,
It was afterward found that hÂ« was dlsÂ«
appointed In love. He had set his heart
on a woman and this. was the eve of her
marriage with another man. Â¦, â¢
Like Adam, he laid /the blame on the
woman* And the woman said he waa
brave.'
This little note was left by a younz
woman. whoVhad Jumped overboafd:
.â¢â¢You. who read this will think I am a
"This fellow flashed a pistol on a pas
senger who tried to step him.
" 'Let me alone.' he said, 'and you
needn't try to find me. for I don't even
want to see a human being again.'
' "He got his -wish. He was probably
laden. with weights to keep him down. f,n"
he never came to the surface.
"Now, there Is the strangest cas* on
record." paid the mate, pointing to an
entry which read: 'Feb. 17. 1S97â Manuel
Garcia Jumped from the bow of the boat.
Rescued.' It was the 10:43 trip from San
Francisco. Think' of it! He must have
under the boat without being hit by
the wheels. He said he remembered pass
ing through a great roar. "We picked him
up about a mile back. He was almost
done for and very much frightened.
"Suiddletus," declared the mate, "la a
maniaâ a diseaseâ a germ that gets Into
the air once in a while and always multi
plies â they come in crops."
The mate Is right. Two or three months
are filled with suicide records In bis log
book, and then a stretch of months and
no suicide occurs.
"Oct. 21. *9S. On 11:45 p. m. trip from
Ban Francisco Mrs. Mamie Taylor jumped
from the port side. Identified by hat and
purse left on board."
A few davs later:
"Oct. 28. '93. "Woman Jumped from up
per starboard deck. aft. Rescued. She re
fused to give her name. It was the 10:30
p. m. trip from Oakland. She Jumped as
the boat was nearlng the slip on the San
Francisco side."
"Women stand a better chance of being
rescued than men," said the mate. "Their
clothes act as balloons to keep them up
for a few moments, and at such times
every moment counts.
"Besides, they scream, and if it ts dark
we can locate them. Now this girl -was
like a bell buoy and although ; it was &
dark night we got her. Her silk sktrt was
Inflated and she sat on the water, scream-
"She apologized right away far causing
us so much trouble and then began to
cry and sob and say how she couldn't
str.nd the disgrace of It all and Fred had
promised to marry her and he had gone
to the Klondike.
"An 'old German who used to play the
zither comes next in the * suicide bookâ
but he was stopped in time.
"After he had finished playing' he said
to his friends. 'Well, I guess 'I go throw
me onto the bay.' He was climbing over
boa rd when he was nulled back. "
"Within a few days another musician,
a barytone, did something similar.
"He had a beautiful voleÂ© and had Just
finished singing 'Rocked In -the Cradle oS
the Deep. 1 He went out and jumped over.
It was dark and we didn't even see his
body."
Then comes an account In the mate's
book of a young man who reached over
the railing after his straw hat that had
blown off and he fell over and lost bis
life.
Next, two girls who had been drinking
said "What's the use?" and they, stepped
over, and were lost.
The next record is of a little miss Just
starting In on her. teens whose whole life
was blackened because she couldn't wear
her best clothes So she put on bar old
clothes and walked off the aft deck of in*
ferry-boat Just as It was leaving the Oak
land pier. She was rescued, scolded and
sent " home.
. 7Now that girl.** said the mate pointing
to the next entry "tried suicide five times.
She", tried; the ga.o route, carbolic , add*
chloroform and twice on the bay, but b ha
was a pood swimmer arid kept up* until
wo -reached her."
"She jumped from the starboard deck
aft, 1 while the- ~ boat waa passing Goat
Island. That's where the majority of sul
cides. make their death ' leap.'' he said as
he ; closed . his suicide book and uncoiled
the ropÂ« on thÂ«* forward deck, stretching
It across to keep the crowd back whlla
thÂ« boat landed. ISABEL FRASER.
*A If AN overboard!" The cry struck
/ \/\ terror to every heart as It was
I Y I echoed down the deck of the
j^ Oakland ferry.
We crowded out on the deck
and looked at the sullen waters that had
but Just swallowed up their voluntary
Â¦ prey.
The epot where the man had gone down
Â¦was marked by his hat â a silent testimo
nial of faithfulness to Its master in
death's dark hourâ by Its very worthlpss
r.ej=s drawing- pity for the wreck below.
The ferry-boat slowed up and stopped
The lifeboat was lowered and manned am".
Â«ill pulled together, steering toward the
hat.
t But the tide was strong: and the boat
seemed to make no progress. The unfor
tunate man. when he came up and strug
rled toward the boat, was held back hy
the vengeful tide, which seemed to say:
'Tool have taken this fate upon your-
selfâ take it now In full."
"That little touch of nature which makes
all mankind ak!n" reached out from the
people on board, -who witched the strug
gles of the "man overboard" with a tense-
Bess born, of sympathy.
One*â twiceâ three, times we watched
Mm come up and struggle toward the life
boat.
By the third time we had been carried
*o far apart that his form looked like a
piece of driftwood on the crest of a wave,
and then he pnr.k from view.
The lifeboat re<-onnnitered a wh!le. then
picked up h!? hat and returned to the
ferry-boat and off we steamed to Oak
land minus one passenger, who but a mo
ment before was one of us and whose soul
et the great white throne was perhaps
row answering- for the deeds done In the
flesh.
The lifeboat enme back. The deck
hands hoisted It to Its place and continued
â¢where they left eff cleaning the white
paint and moppin? up the deck?. lower
ing: the lifeboat and pulling out for the
suicide Is part of their routine. Just bs
much a? keeping- the decks clean and haul
ing the freight on and eff the ferry.
The cry. "JTan Overboard!" means to
the deck hands "Take your place at the
ropes of the life saving boat aâ i await
the command of your superior oClcer, the
captain."
Every boat's crew on the bay Is well
drilled In lowering: the lifeboats and pull-
In? out at sea.
They have a boat drill twice a week and
so well trained are they thct fifty seconds
after the bell Is rung the lifeboat Is man
. ned and In the br.y, awaitinz the captain's
orders.
Wh^n the cry. "Man Overboard!" Is
hfard. a deck hand presses an electric
button in a part of the vessel known only
to the crew. This rings the "suicide bell"
1n the captain's pilot-house. Then the
raptain presses a button which rings' an
electric bell down In the engine-room and
means "Reverse your engines!"
The captain and engineer both say that
the bell always startles and surprises
them.
The boat slows up. The captain runs
from the forward cilot-house aft. The
crew have taken their places at the ropes
of the lifeboat. Every one Is at his post.
And now comes the most trying part,
the waiting for the vessel's wake to be
come calm. The lifeboat roust not be low
ered new, else It would be dashed to
pieces against the side of the big boat.
The passengers do not understand this.
To them precious time is being lost and
a man's life Is hanging la the balance. A
minute at such a time n-fms like an hour.
"Why are Che men standing waiting?
Why Is the captain looking at the water
end not at the struggling man?
The captain Is abused.
The men at the ropes are called all sorts
of names and the officious man Is going to
report the whole affair.
Finally the signal Is given.
"Lower the boat." commands the cap
tain.
The boat Is already unfastened and
swung out over the water. At this signal
It is lowered. As It Is going down to the
-water the men Jump In. The second mate
takes the helm and directs the deckhands,
who take their places at the oars and pull
out as fast as the waves and tide will
allow.
"We like to get what we go after," says
the second mate.
The life-saving crew talk as though
they accredited themselves with "duty
Â¦well done" -when they bring back a live
body and "duty done" when they bring
back an â¢ unconscious body. "But," to
Quote one of the crew, "we feel awful
silly when we bring back Just a hat.
"We get Just about half of those who
jump overboard," he continued. "Even
though we are aulte sure the person Is
dead, we try on him all the stereotyped
movements for restoring life If It Is there,
"We roll him over a barrel to get the water
6ut of him; then we raise his arms and
press his sides to restore breathing. We
rub his pulse and pour brandy down bim^
to restore circulation, and sometimes we"
ere rewarded. Then we ring up and send
fcim to the County Hospital."
The crew who risk their lives for the
would-be suicide are seldom thanked by
the "man overboard."
"More often we are cursed," says one
who has made a record in saving lives.
"I jumped from the pier after a woman
who cald she was going to marry the,
waves and she fought me like a tigress
and said I was trying to keep her from
her husband."
A mercenary Italian fisherman says that
for a live man that you fish out you get
nothing, but for a corpse the city pays
you $10, besides what you get off the dead
man's person. Â»>..,.'.'-
About $500 a year Is expended from the
city arid county funds for the return of
Â£ead bodies from the bay.
Sometimes these fishers of men stay out
In their boats all night searching for their
ghastly prizeâ the corpse of a suicide of a
few days past. They shoot in and out tnd
underneath the piers, then out into the
moonlight and down with the tide.
When the corpse is found it is booked
Into with long tpears and drawn toward
the boat Then the boatman sends the
corpse to the morgue.
The corpse arrives at the morgue al- ]

LER Is already well known as a
writer of novels. We now have the
pleasure of making her acquaint
ance as the author of a very charming

She writes with deep sentiment and yet
with an epigrammatic humor that makes
her stories delightful reading.; . In nearly
all of (he fourteen- stories she works her
little plots out on the cumulative method
âholding her surprises until : the end,
when the climax is most effective."

Literary Notes.
"An Affair in the South. Seas," by Leigh
THE name of Gwendolen Overton Is
already familiar to the readers of
the San Francisco Argonaut as a
writer of good tales. Many of her
Ebort etorles give evidence of con
siderable talent, but her best work to date
Is a novel recently published by the Mac
tnillan Company of New York. It at once
places Miss Overton as a leader among
Californian novel writers. For that mat
ter her book. "The Heritage of Unrest."
would do credit to any of the writers who
have irs.de hits along similar lines. She
is a Tennessee woman by birth, though
most cf her life has been spent In tho
army posts of the Southwestern States.
Her novel has already run Into a second
edition within one week of publication. .
The scene of this particular etory is laid
on the great plains of the Southweet, of
New Mexico and Arizona, and the period
covered is the lifetime of the heroine â a
splendid creature whose career Is shad
owed by the curse of mixed blood.
Miss Overton gives a remarkably vlvjii
picture of the life of the plains during
that season when the Apaches were in
their prime and at their worst, from a
Government standpoint. She does not
fcar.clle her Indian subjects with a maudlin
sentimentality, but seems fair and just in
her criticI-Trcs of the citizens, the Indian
egents and their money grabbing policy,
8r<d cf the soldiers. As to the absolute
correctness of her statements and deduc
tions it 'would reaulre some one whose
personal experience or intimate connec
tion had placed them in a position to
Judge, but to the general reader her words
ring true and at least conform to accepted
history.
It is not likely that people will read
Miss Overton'6 book In the light cf a his
tory of Indian affairs, nor yet again as
a picture of army life at these South
western posts, when an officer's troubles
amounted to more than merely sitting
around and indulging in the small talk
of a shaded veranda. True it would serve
both these purposes admirably, but they
are made subservient to the strong tale
which is unfolded as the reader hurries
over the pages.
It Tray b<e said that at times Miss Over
ton Is a little sketchy and Inclined to
make her chapters almost short stories
in themselves, but still she has the knack
of bringing her characters so forcefully
to the nilnd's eye and possesses the fac
ulty of painting her incidents bo vividly
that the reader Is carried on and on tn
Epite of himself.
Unless some cne takes the book away
from you by force you will find It to be
merely a matter of one consecutive
reading, and when I say "hurries over the
pages" I mean not because they, are un
interesting but quite the contrary. Miss
Overton possesses that art which made
the books of Dumas so impossible to put
down; or, for an example of more recent
date, which made the "Prisoner of Zenda"
keep a list of library readers on the wait-
Ing card. _
There Is very little of comedy to be
found in the pages of "The Heritage of
Unrest," but there Is much of tragedy and
that of the kind that racks men's souls.
The opening chapter tells of Lieutenant
Landor's cavalry troop making a forced
march on the desert, of the gradual using
up of all the extra horses, of the break-
Ing of the leg of a horse when there Is
no other animal to replace the one gone
and then of tne realizing of that rider
that he must follow the troop on foot. It
is either the chance of one mail's life or
the loss of many.
This soldier has been the boyhood friend
of Landor and before being left behind
makes a confession and exacts a promise
from the lieutenant that he will care for
this man's Uttle daughter. The child's
mother was a half-breed Mescalero wo
man.
Landor Is true to his trust. He gets
Felipa, has her educated and finally mar
ries herâ rot because he is In love with
her but because he thinks that It is his
duty, And he knows that be likes her well
.enough to risk the lack of affection.
Landor hates Apaches as he would rat
tlesnakes and the girl's inheritance
through her mother of one-quarter Apache
Is constantly coming to the surfaceâ
sometimes in a little way that merely ex
asperates, such as her habit of dress, and
then acaln In a more eerious manner, as
hc-r love for malting animals fight and
her lack of sympathy or understanding of
physical pain in others.
Felipa admires Landor. respects him and
iÂ» as true to him as steel; but neverthe
less she knows that he has not won her
heart and, worst of all, meets a man who
does win her love.
Calrness Is really a fine fellow, although
he, too, possesses the "heritage of un
rest" He it an Englishman by parent
age, but a man ot no country by choice.
It 1s a strong situation where these two
children of social pariahs llrst find their
common bond of sympathy:
"How do you come to be living . with the

to arrive at a question Indirectly. "Hart you

It. because after ail the question waa not Im
pertinent. So be only * answered with - short

Felipa could not help the light of relief that
came on her face, but . realising It ah* . was
confused.
He helped her out.
"I have drifted' in a way," ' he went on . to
explain. "I left home when I was a mere boy
and the spirit of savagery and unrest laid hold

of me. I can't break away. And Fm not even
pure that I want to. You.* I darÂ« ' say, can't
understand." Vet he felt -. bo sure, for some
reason, that ehe could that he merely nodded
his head when she said brietly, "I caa."!
"Then, too." he went on, "there is something
In the Indian character that atrikes a respon
sive chord in ' me. I come , of . lawless . stock
myself. I was born in . Sydney/' Then he
Hopped Bhcrt. What business was it ofheri
where he hed b*en born? HÂ« had never seen
fit to speak of It before.- Iffevertless, he Intend-"
ed that she should ' tnderstand now. So he
made it: quite plain. "Sydney was a convict
eettlement, you know," he Bald deliberately,
"and marriages v.-ere promiscuous. My grand-'
father was an officer vrho was best away from
England. My grandmother poisoned her first
husband. That is on my mother's side. On
my father's side it was about as mixed." He
Uaned back, crossing hid booted legs and run
ning his fingers into his cartridge- belt. His
r^anrer aeked with a certain defiance, what
Â»-he was going to do about it, or to think..
And what she did was to Eay. with deliber
ation equal to his own. that her mother "had
heen a hair-breed Mescalero and her father a
private. Â¦,
Despite such unpromising: stock, : Miss
Overton succeeds In making out of .hen
characters a man and' a woman who
carry the reader's sympathy to the end.
According to the author, fidelity Is evi
dently an Apache virtue, and in this re
spect Fellpa Is a thorough Indian. Tha
Idea of wronging her husband never en
ters her head, and Calrness, too. Is equal
ly true to his friend.
Landor accidentally finds a letter on a
dead prospector. This letter had been
given .to the miner to deliver to Felipa
and Is an avowal of love from Calrness. In
part It reads: "I do not ask for so much
as your friendship in return, but only
that you remember that my life and devo
tion are yours, and that, should the time
ever come that you need me, you send for
me. I will come. I will never say this
to you again, even should I. see you; but
It Is true, now and for all time."
Fellpa reads the letter to her husband
and frankly admits that she loves Calr
ness, but she scorns any suggestions ot
a legal release. Mi?s Overton decribes
this dramatic Incident with characteristic
lack of gush and consequent gain u
strength:
"And you care for him?"
She nodded. Â«
"Are you certain of it? You have seen bc
very Uttle of him, and you may be mistaken."
If, he had had any hope It vanished before
her unhesitating, positive "No; I am not mis
taken. Ob, no!"
He tock a. <*halr facing ber, as. she put the
letter back in its envelcpe and laid It in her
work-basket. It was very unlike anything: he
h&d ever Imagined concerning situations of the
sort. But then he was not imaginative. "Should
you be glad to be free to marry him?" he asked
in a spirit of unbiased discussion.
She locked at him in perplexity and surprise.
"Hew could I be? There is no use talking
about it." Â«. Â¦Â¦ .
Ho hesitated, then blurted it out, in spita of
the inward warning that it would be unwise.
"I could let yeu free yourself." .
HSs clance fell before hers of. dismay, disap
proval and angerâ an anger ; so righteous that
he felt himself to t>e altogether in the wrong.
"Do you mean divorce?" She said It like an
unholy word. ., â¢-;.;
He had forgotten that the laws and rites of
the church of Rome had a powerful hold. upon
her. though ehe was quite devoid of religious
sentiment. He admitted apologetically, that he
had meant divorce, and che expressed . her re
proach. In spite of himself, and what he
thouKht ought properly to be the tragedy of the
affair, he smiled. The humor of her majestic
disapproval was irresistible under the circum
stances. But she had little sense of humor.
"What would you suggest, then, if I may
ask?" he eaid. He had to give up all pathos in
the light of her deadly simplicity.
"Nothing," she answered. "I can't see why
it rhould make any difference to you, when it
hasn't with me." She had altogether regained
the self-poesession she had been surprised j out
of, with an added note of reserve/
And eo *he had to accept It.
The secret of Miss Overton's success In
making Fellpa the strong and interesting
character that she is lies In that author's
method of contrasting good and evil.
Here she brings out an Apache trait that
is commendable or there one that re
volts. She makes her character live and
breathe and catches the varying moods
with a sure stroke that ts as absorbing as
it is at time3 surprising. Her work
suggests the style of Hamlln Garland.
Fellpa has her evil traits as strongly
marked as her good ones. At times she
is cruel with the flendishncss of the In
dian and all without in the slightest real
izing her actions from the standpoint of
the white man's code of humanism.
. She gloats over a battle royal of her
own arranging between a tarantula and
a vlngarone. She delights in a fight be
tween two wild steers and I then , at an
other time the blood of savagery rises In
her to such an extent that she disobeys
her husband's commands and In his ab
sence goes forth on a still hunt of her
own. It is at such times as these that
the' reader's sympathy with Felipa . is
sorely shaken, but the interest in Miss
Overton's work is unconsciously height
ened. . .
When the Apache taint la most strong
ly In evidence is where FelSpa goes forth
oh the warpath on her own account. Her
husband is away on duty and hostiles are
In the neighborhood. - The heritage of
unrest comes to burn In; her brain and
she buckles on her hunting knife and re
volver to go out into. the freedom of the
night. Wandering by the river she hears
a murmur, a rustle. *
Fellpa' s revolver waa In her hand and cocked
and colnted , straight between two' eyes that
Â¦hone out In the blackness. - And so, ' for an
appreciable time, the stood. . Then a long arm
came feeling out, but because she was . look-
Ing alone . the . sight into the face at the very
end of the muzzle she failed to see It. 'When
it closed tint about her waist she gave a quick
(rasp and fired. But the bullet instead of going
straight through the forehead beneath the head
band, mm she had meant It to do. plowed
down. The grasp on the body relaxed for "an
Instant; the next It had tightened, and a
branch had struck the pistol from her hand.
And now It Â¦ 'was a . struggle of . sheer, force
and agility. She managed to . whip out . the
knife from her belt and strike time and again
again through sinewy flesh to, the bone. The
' only noise was .the * dragging ; of their ; feet on
the sand, the cracking of the willows and the
Â¦wishing of .the blade. It was savage ' against
cavare, two vicious, fearless beastn. '
The Apache. In Fellpa waa fully, awake now,
, awake . In - the bliss of , killing. : the frenzy of
fight, and awake, too. In the Instinct which
told .her . how, with â¢ a deep-drawn ; breath, a
contraction, a sudden drop and writhing, she
would be free of thÂ« arms of steel. And she
wu free." but . not â¢' to turn > and t run â to lunge
forward. . once and again, her breath hilling
between her clenched, bared teeth.*
The buck fell back before" her, fury.' but she
followed him thrusting ! and ; slashing. ' . Yet It
might not even then have ended well "for her
had there not come from somewhere overhead
the sound most dreaded as an omen of harm
by all Apache*â the hoot of an owl. -The In
dian gave a low cry. of dismay and turned and
darted In among the i bushes.
"The Heritage ' of Unrest 1 ' is not a long
story, yet there are more exciting episodes
in it than are ; generally - allotted . to the
modern , novel. It ' Is ! . orrrmlsslble to Â¦ aay
that â¢ the story, throughout deals iwith the
: Bterner facts, of life: and: works jup\ to 'a

â¢That's all right. Mr. Dâ /â¢ interrupted
McCutcheon: "don't say another work
about it. It's 'nice* of you. but really I
don't see how the deuce wa can carry tha
thing out as you Intend. You see, Just
before you got here this evening our host
ess actually forced ma to repeat thoM
verses for the crowdâ and I did so."
A few months later Mr. McCutcheoa
attended a small dinner party In a city
not far from Lafayette, and among tha
guests was the man who had admired the
response. Everything was Informal, and
It was not long before one of the ladies
called for toasts. The "admirer," as ha.
may be called, was the first one urged to>
"say something nice." He arose and pro
fusely apologized for what be was about
to perpetrate, admitting that he had writ
ten some verses hurriedly for a Uttle af
fair that did not ccme off, but if tha oth
ers would promise to "throw no plates"
he would give a toast to "a woman's
smile." Forgetful that the man who wrote
them was present, he recited thÂ» verses
gallantly, and then modestly sat down,
with an uncertain sort of applause- as hla
recompense.
Suddenly the man remembered that thÂ«
writer of the verses was sitting directly
opposite and he began to turn a fiery red.
He lost his power of speech and was tha
most uncomfortable person who ever
studied a plate at a dinner party. As sooa
as the ladles left tha room he dragged
Mr. McCutcheon off to a corner and ex
claimed: "I want to explain, old man.
Don't think that I had forgotten that you
wrote that toast. I was not trying ta
steal your thunder. It was and Is my in
tention to introduce you as tha author
when we go Into the drawing room and

who has treated thÂ» city's story from a
novel point of view. Instead of following
the customary plan of dealing with facts
and alluding Incidentally to nlstorto sites,
the author has described a series of ex
cursions to old landmarks and woven thÂ«
history about them. The erection of tab
lets within recent ytears In many parts of
the city has helped materially to identify
Important sites and to give a definite
cense of realism to the story of the past.
To make a tour of these memorials In
their proper order and relate the interest
ing events connected therewith la the plan
of the book. Thus, In turn, one visits the
old Dutch settlement, the early English
colony, the city as it looked before the
Revolution, the captured town, the Federal
capital, the city as It appeared when the
Erie canal was completed, and finally the
modern metropolis. Copies of old prints
and rare maps and many plates made
tjcom recent photographs help to empha
size the landmark feature of the work. A
special effort has been made to render tha
story Particularly interesting and attrac
tive to. the young: at the same time, the
careful reproduction of Inscriptions, the
exact location of historic names, an ex
planation of the origin of street names,
and a comprehensive bibliography and
list of references, must prove of value to
the teacher and the student of history.

Clever Women J^eieciives Who Caich Smugglers.
â¢=ff=:HERE has been a recent discussion
jl as to the employment of women as
]i detectives In hotels, in shops and in
police cases. Women have been em
ployed as private detectives for years by
the various agencies In cases requiring
epecially fine work. For procuring evi
dence in divorce cases they are often em
ployed and their aptness has been proved.
The woman detective can change hef
identity with her costume far more easily
than a man. If she is tactful she can win
confidence and will arouse no suspicion.
These advantages fit her peculiarly for
the work.
Women have In recent years made rec
ords in the big department stores, where
they detect shoplifters srnd pickpockets.
These women dress as though on a shop
ping tour and are not known* to the sales
women. They pass about from counter to
counter examining goods, but manage to
keep an eye on people- they suspect and
follow them about until they, see them
actually taking goods from the tables.
In the customs service about a dozen
women are . employed as customs Inspec
tors. They look out for women smugglers .
end have been, very successful In 'detect-,
ing these fair swindlers of the Govern
ment.
It is not the amateur smuggler or the
Immigrant that these women look after,
but the women who of late years have
made a profession of smuggling, acting In
collusion with. men and apparently mak
ing the trade pay well. They are always
good, looking, well -dressed and liberally
supplied with money, which they dispense
in generous tips to the stewardess and
boys.
Women take naturally to smuggling; so
the professionals are adepts at the game.
Even the average woman likes the idea
of getting In lace or jewels or. clothes in
this way and proudly displays her smug
gled goods and 'tells the story of her feat
whenever an occasion offers..
It . was npt until women began to . make
a business of smuggling that it was
thought necessary to employ detectives of
their own sex to apprehend thenv Evi
dence Is usually obtained against them by
one of the women; inspectors who travels
from > the other side as a passenger and
observes or makes the acquaintance of the'
suspected â¢ person on" the trip across. /
If evidence has been - secured the word
is quietly passed to the, inspector! on the
pier, and when the . smuggler . prepares to
go ashore she is asked' to submit to . a
search/Every known device is resorted to
by the women .'srnugg.ers in their efforts to
conceal genis and lace. Frequently ';Â¦ the
contraband articles are securely sewn be-,
tween the lining and the material" of i a*
gown. . Diamonds ' are \ hidden : in the hair
and In pads and bustles, and some â¢ r "6meh
have been found with yards of costly lace
rolled about their bodies. .
Â¦The women. detectives In the.employ^of
the Custom-house pafss , through , a civil
service examination and receive" $3 a day.
The 1 work, while exacting. Is : not', heavy,
the* working day usually ending | at noon.'
Sometimes an Immigrant woman . Is dls-,
covered ; in" an attempt to smuggle, but'the
effort' is always a clumsy one,'; easllytde-'
tected. V "â¢ : .
;>,; But the professional, smuggler is always
cool,* collected, . plausible/, with ; plenty; of
neryÂ© ..and^many ; excuses "t when detected."'
She, always faffects to* make; light ' of the
matter.; Even when subjected to a most
humiliating search " by Â¦ the women' detect

Since thÂ« death of Queen Victoria paV
llc interest concerning the Koh-i-noor has
revived. The famous stone is not. as I*
usually supposed, part of the late Queen"*
regalia, but was her private property. It
was 'made into a brooch and worn occa^.
slonally at state functions. It was exhib
ited at the great exhibition of 1SS1. and at
that time was valued at J700.000. In its
original uncut state It weighed 800 karats/

that it was' impossible tu see a ; stone's

Â¦"Hulls, as I said before, do not show
over eighteen' miles from this point, and
unless the weather is very favorable they,
are of little aid beyond fifteen miles. The
first thing is to settle on the nationality

*J So the wires buzzed while anxious
watchers waited for the overdue
Rio. So the inquiries come, day an:t
sight, as long as there's a ship scheduled
to sail through the Golden Gate and sorni
cne on shore â friend, agent, sweetheart or
â¢wife â Is counting the moments until Its
arrival. -! .vv
porting the movements of the vessels that
come and gD at this harbor.*~Mr." Hyslop
Is still a young man, but he is the oldest
and best friend of the ships that sail the
seas. For there is never a new vessel puts
into this iKirt that Mr. Hyslop does* not
study her thoroughly from bow to stern
so that he'd be able to recognize her in
the dark on her second trip. -As for the
vessels that make steady runs here, Mr.
Hyslop can tell them with half an eye.
He squints his eye at his telescope,
which Is a sixteen-foot magnifier with a
seven and a half inch lens, and every
smudge on the horizon becomes a ship of
some kind, which he can usually name
long before the letters are visible even in
the gJass. All ships do not look alike to
John Hyslop. To the landlubber they have
no personality, But to him each individual
ship has character and a distinguishing
mark that ! makes it possible for him to
name it at a distance Â¦when even the
telescope is powerless to decipher the let*;
ters. " . ',
For instance, on the Thursday that the
. Mr.,' Hyslop has the, finest record of any
man In the United < States for sighting
ships ; at long '. distance. : A ' fleck out > at
sea' has often been* named by him'.; One of
his great} feats was Â¦' sighting, Identifying
and reporting a steamer at a^distance?of
twenty -seven", and : a half miles. "( It was*
the i ; Quejim of the Pacific f bound ' in } from
VictorlaT B.;, C. , and when Mr/ Hyslop got
his eye* on her and reported her, to the ex'-,
change ; she : : was making out from & Point
Reyes.y ' At -the; exchange the clerk ' did
not- like to: receive and. post the .report
with ; the ship., at suclt an unusual '-dis
tance. " Mr. ; Hyslop's professional pride
was ; aroused and shortly after ' ( wh'en "the
bhipt came; nearer his judgment was" vin
dicated, for. it was the Queen. He named
the steamer when the glass only revealed
the tips of her spars and the smoke," stak-
"Two or three hours later I learned that
my wits .had not gone 'a-gllmmering. -The
reason ,. I could : not : sea her was that Â» sh i
had had a hole punched in her: bottom by
a* thump on; the bar, had drifted out to
sea again and sunk in twenty-six fathoms
of.. water before the fog." had lifted."'- Â¦
Â¦ "A'V somewhat -similar -experience was
with . the * Palestine about ten" ; years ago.
I sighted her In a break of the fog and
telephoned to the exchange that she wai
crossing the bar. About fifteen , minutes
afterward the fog all blew away and the
Palestine was not in sight. I didn't know
whether I had " been in. a trance 'or. seen
the ' Flying , Dutchman. " :: I nearly ruptured
an eye trying to find the old coal vessel,
but , she \ had J ~ completely , disappeared,
which" fact . I telephoned '.. to . the 'exchange '<Â¦
"If only the* Rio had fired her guns or
given some signalof distress I might have
flashed â¢' the news in time," said ' Hyslop,
"for. I was awake, but beyond that toot
of the whistle she gave no sign.
But almost as suddenly as it had lifted
the fog shut down again like a pall,
shrouding land and . sea. Hyslop "heard
the.Rlo's whistle and waited once more to
hear her anchor clang. But Instead the
steamer went plowing through^' the' dark
and fog. Then out: of .the night .and* the
mist came a long 'whistle. But Hyslop
could not guess that that one sound was
the death ; rattle of the Rio going down
with Its precious freight of human souls
to^Davy Jones* locker.

greater than that of the ships of other
nations, while the hoist is much less than
the American idea of sky-scraping. No
two ships have exactly the same man
ner of setting their staysails. Then there
are a lot of other points that help Iden
tify a sh!p before her name Is visible."
Mr. Hyslop proved this "by taking- a
peep at the glass and identifying the
brig W. S. Irwin from Honolulu, still six
miles out. and the German steamer Tot
mes, and the four-masted schooner Nov
elty, a. bit nearer, but all were white
fcmcdges against the blue to ns.
Mr. Hyslop has been with the Mer
chants' Exchange ever since he was a
boy old enough to run errands. Every
one liked "Johnnie," and as soon as he
was old enough he. was sent down to
Metggs wharf to learn that end of the
business. There he began to take point
ers on the different ships that put Into
port here, and gradually had a valuable
stock of information stowed away that
enabled him to take the Important posi
tion of observer at Point Lobos lookout.
The little house is anchored In a bed of
rocks with rock spikes for anchors. Be
eldes the telescope Mr. Hyslop's appar
atus consists of an anemometer, & bar
ometer, doxens of signal flags and three
thermometers which he reads four times
a day and reports to the exchange and
the' weather prophet.
Mr. Hyslop's home is a steep climb from
the aerie perch to a bit of level land near
the Cliff House. There he lives wj.th bJÂ»
aunt and cousin when be Is not busy in
the lookout. There is a pretty patch of
garden around the house and Mr. Hyslop
is well content with this home by the
sea. In fact he says he could not sleep
away from the music 'of the billow's roar.
Mr. Hyslop is not only en rapport with
the ships, but he seems to have an almost
clairvoyant power of Identifying thÂ© men
on board the pilot boats. For instance,
some one helloed to find out what pilot
had boarded a steamer, and Hyslop after
a careful scrutiny answered that It waa
Pilot Newton Jordan. "I have trained
myself," he said, "to be able to recognize
them from the slightest clew. I know the
set of their heads, gestures, height, etc.,
so even when I can't get a good look at
their * faces I Â¦ can make a pretty safe
guess."
Although Mr. Hyslop is perched way op
there above the world, he has come into
closer contact with death than bis fellow
men who rub elbows with the throbbing
world. For up there within Mr. Hyslop's
ken have been enacted some of the great
tragedies of the- sea. Then, too, many
people of suicidal bent wander out In that
direction and voluntarily plunge to a wat
ery, death. . Mr. Hyslop has found the bod
ies of several suicides washed up on tha
beach. How many others have taken the
plunge in the black of the night under bis
very eyes it is Impossible to say.
But day In and month out these wÂ»it
years John Hyslop has sat trp aloft ard
reported- the doings of Jack Tar to' the
Merchants' Exchange. And it is thÂ«Â«frÂ«
to . bis prompt and unusually eSedent
work that anxious hearts on shore run get

It'.was.not the truth, bat perhaps the

; *Jâ¢\ RIVATE Billy Harkness passed
!Tj 1 half the night before the battle In
H-^ collecting subscriptions for what he
I called a "tontine" for those who
tXÂ» were to take part in the frontal
portJo:.- of the attack. There were to^ be
about 100 men engaged in that dangerous
enterprise, about half a company of
Billy's own regiment, the Loyal Upshlres;
and the same number of the Brocklehurst
Rifles, r â¢
Billy's scheme caught on well enough,
though many of those asked â and willing
â to enter the tontine did not possess
either the sovereign which he required of
them or even half that sum. From these
Billy accepted an order for the money
against the next installment of pay due
them. In this way, and with the help
of donations from officers and others,
Billy collected for his tontine over Â£100
In cash and promises. This he deposited
to the hands of the regimental doctor,
with explanations.
"But how am I to know who has won
lit?" a*ked the medico.
And Billy explained that BlueÂ© It wouid
bÂ« the doctor's duty after the light to
find and fetch In. with his bearers and
ambulance, the -wounded, and bury the
dead, it would be easy for him to Judge
who was the man entitled to sweep the
pool.
"It's him that gets farthest, alive but
wounded." Billy said; "the unwounded is
disqualified, sir."
"What if two ere toother?" asked thÂ«
doctor.
Tou*ll have to Judge, sir. If you'U be
good enough," Billy explained; "and If
you was to sec fit to divide the pool
among two or three, there'd be no one
would dispute your decision.**
The doctor accepted his appointment,
laughingly congratulating Billy upon his
tontine. "It's a grand plan, Harkness,"
be said, "and no mistake! But it's hard
on the chaps that pet in unwounded, if
Â£nr 4o!"
â¢'You're right sir. It does seem so."
Billy replied. "But if they do get in.
why, lord, they'll be glad enough to have
got off with whole skins and to let some
one else take the pool!"
There was a kopje that stood In the way
of the British advance, like a. lion in the
path. The great rocky bill was firmly
held by a strong commando of Boers,
â¢who had Intrenched themselves after
tneir fashion, and had mounted several
euns to command the approaches.
The position was practically impreg
nable to frontal attack, for from the foot
of the kopje there ran out in this direc
tion a level plain, without cover or with
only an occasional thornbush or isolated
stone or rock. Troops attacking from
the front would be exposed to a wither
ing flre from every gun and rifle that the
Boers should choose to bring to bear
upon them, and must advance half way to
the foot of the hllL
For this reason the position was to be
attacked from both flanks, only the two
half companies already mentioned being
detailed to draw the flre of the enemy
and keep his attention as far as possible
from the main attack by . attempting, or
pretending to attempt, to rush the position
from the front. The task entrusted to the
hundred brave fellows seleced for ; tnls
enterprise was dangerous enough. It was
likely to prove fatal to most or all of
those concerned, and that was why Bill
Harkness thought of his tontine, and why
tils ingenious idea "caught on" among
those about to take part in the affair.
The four young officers engaged com
menced operations overnight by placing
their handful of men in skirmishing order
under what little cover each man could
find for himself at three-quarters of a
mile from the kopje.
At dawn the guns from the British posi
tion shelled the Boer camp with vigor, as
though preparing for a frontal attack in
force, the little body of scattered men of
the Upshlres and Rifles supporting the il
lusion by peppering the hill with immense
energy from a hundred, points. in such a
manner as to lead the enemy to suppose
they were being attacked by a* very much
larger force, while the troops engaged in
the main movement made wide sweeps to
right and left Under good cover. So much
tor the battle, which went ultimately in
favor of the British. It Is with the move
ments of the hundred or 59 of men en-
Ettfced in the frontal attack that we are
concerned at present.
The enemy replied to their flre with a,
furious fusillade of shrapnel, which
searched the hiding- places of our handful
of subscribers to Billy's tontine and killed
or wounded a score of them before the
men had advanced one Inch from the po
sitions each had taken up under cover of
darkness.
At length the signal was given for the
advance, and each man left Wb shelter to
creep or rush over as many yards of open
as lay between him and the next spot,
nearer the kopje, where he could lie con
cealed while re put in a few shots from
him own rifie and drew fifty from those
of unseen Boer marksmen.
It was a lamentable task that was set
the poor fellows, and they were not long:
in learning this. , In the first rush forward
some twenty or thirty fell dead or wound
ed and were left lying in the open, to wrig
gle, if alive, toward some tuft of grass or
any kind of shelter from the hall of bul
lets which swept over every moving thing
visible to the Boers. Many found it better
to lie still, rather than attract the ene
my's fire by making any movement, and
so they Jay and suffered throughout the
scorching day, without water and with
out shade, dead and dying together. '
For many hours the skirmishing attack
continued. The men knew well enough
that they could not take the position and
were not expected to do so; that they
were there to draw the enemy's fire and
hold his attention by constantly creeping
closer and by pouring- in bullets enough
to delude him, If possible. Into supposing
that he was' being attacked by a large
force.
By 4 in the afternoon there may have
been a 6core of men left unwounded. or
so slightly wounded as to be able to con
tinue the advance, which was. of course,
by this time perfectly useless and aim
less; but the men remaining In the run
ning remembered the tontine, and though
they would have served the military pur
pose for which they had been set that
fatal task quite as well by lying, each In
the safest spot he could find, until night
or until the kopje should have been taken
by the main attack, each man now
thought of his chance for the hundred
pounds pool and pushed on, watching his
rivals and trying to gain a foot or two of
space for the tontine's sake, but thinking
little of the enemy, who sat and picked
him off whenever he moved, as a man
may sit and shoot the rabbits that dart
from hole to hole.
By 6 m the evening there were five men
still In the running; by 7 there were three
Two of them were close together, run
ningâas it wereâ neck and neck, so close
to one another that they made when they
moved for the same rock: or thorn bush.
The third man. was fifty yards away on
th . eIr v Utt and PÂ« rha P s a yard or two
ahead. The two watched the one with
anxiety, realizing that he was slightly in
front .The- single man was an- Upshiro
private, while of the other pair one was
a sergeant in the' same regiment and the
other a fine young ' private ; in the Rifles :
These two conversed in a friendly manner
In spite of their grim rivalry. Each was
slightly wounded. The older man was shot
through the left arm; . the younger
dragged his right foot , Both were glad I of
their wounds, for by virtue of them they
were qualified to win Billy Harkness' ton
tine. As for Billy himself, he had fallen
long since and lay groaning a quarter of

ITS ALL well enough to Inveigh against

"Quite a number of years ago It bo hap
pened that it W2s necessary for me in the
course of my business to go on the.St;
Louis Fire Department, temporarily. Ap
parently I was a real fireman and I was
regularly assigned to one of the engine
house* In the business part of St. Louis.
"One night we were called out for a fire
in the cellar of a candy store. Pretty
soon a battalion chief came along.
" 'Burst that grating,' the chief yelled at
one of my company.
"The mas grabbed an az and began
smashing the iron bars. He had them out
of the way in a second and then the
chief yelled at me to take the hose into
the cellar. It looked like sure death to
xne. Smoke -was pouring out of the cellar
in dense black clouds and all above flames
were to bÂ« Been. Down I went with my
foreman and two other men.
"The nnoke -was the tousrhest proposi
tion I had ever been up against. My eyes
burned as though acid were in- them. I
heard the other firemen coughing and
gasping for breath, but- strangely enough
my lungs were not Â»Â«riously affected. We
kept on groping our way In and now we
could seÂ« the flzmea ahead of us. Tb9

showing signs of. great. distress. Before
long one of them keeled over. Two of his
comrades dragged him out and then came
on back. ' ;. '. .

"Hy eyes had improved now that they,
were watering so furiously and my bron
chial tubes were holding out .with amaz
ing tenacity. In five minutes ' more one
of the chaps ~ who had .carried out the
other fireman was overcome by the
smoke and be bad to be lugged out. Ho
was an old-timer and when Â¦ he â¢ came to
outside he asked where the greeny was.
When they told him I was still Inside
he groaned In shame and said that I must
have been born In hell.
4 'Wdl, I stuck It out through the whole
fire and when It was all over, the old fire
men told me I was certainly 'a wonder.
And so I really was. and I can say that
without taking any credit to myself. It
was just a case of cigarette smoking.
"For years I had been inhaling all sort3
of cigarettes, and I had so accustomed my
bronchial tubes and the upper part of, my
lungs to smoke that the- smoke from
the fire did not hurt me half so much as
the regular firemen, who had been fight
ing: fires all their lives. So here Is a tip
for all fire departments: If they want to
have their men able to. stand all kinds of
smoke, just teach them to smoke and in
hale cigarettes and they will develop Into
regular salamanders.".Â£&$g
Fish That Remained Frozen for
Eleven Years and Then
Came To Life.
1 HAVE read with a great deal of in
. terest Â¦ an article headed' ."Life In
Frozen Fish." While it does not seem
credible that fish can be frozen unt!l
they are as hard as a stone and upon
being placed in. cold- water for a few mo
ments only become as lively as ever, it
Is. nevertheless true. . - -- .
In 1S73 I was residing at Junction City,
a pretty little city located in a romantic
spot on the banks of Mill Creek In cen
tral Wisconsin. The country at that tlreie
was -new and fish and game were plenti
ful. Mill Creek was at the time famous
as a trout stream, it being no trouble a?
all to catch fifty pounds of speckled trout
In a half day's fishing. February 15, 1S73-
I A remember Â¦ the date because it was my
twenty r first birthdayâ I took down niv
rifle and struck out into the forest for the
purpose of killing a deer. I had wandered a
distance of, perhaps two miles, when I ran
onto an old hunter who had cut a hole In
the Ice, through whlch*he was fishing for
trout. He was meeting with great suc
cess, for scattered all around him couM
be seen the speckled beauties, where h.*
had thrown them as he took them off his
hook. I was Invited to help myself, which
Invitation I cheerfully accepted and I
proceeded to put a number of the fish In
my game bag.
It was just 4:47 o'clock when I returned
homethat afternoon, tired and hungrv,
and. after hanging: up my rifle, took one
of the largest of the trout and placed It
out In a large cold-storage warehouse
that stood near my house, intending to
present It to "Uncle" Sam Carson for Ms
breakfast the next morning. Tho fish
was forgotten and as a result lay In that
warehouse solidly "frozen until June 10,
18S4. JS*ow, here is the strange part of
my story, which I should hesitate to re
late had not the article referred to paved
the way. as it were.
On the night of the date last mentioned.
Just about eleven years after this flah had
been placed In tlie cold storage, tha build'
Ing was totally destroyed by fire. During
the process of the fire the Fire Depart
ment. In the effort to save the property,
had thrown sufficient water to fill up thj
cellar, which by the way, was. walled up
in rock and cement, and was, therefor*,
water tight. Three years later It was do
cided to rebuild' the cold-storag-e ware
house upon the site originally occupied,
and men were set to work pumping the
water out of the cellar, which the raln<*
had kept well filled. To our amazement
447 fair-sized speckled trout were taken
out,- besides the old one, which had evi
dently fallen into the cellar at tho time
the warehouse was destroyed, thawed
out and spawned. The original trout was
easily Identified, one of Ifs eyes having
been accidentally knocked out and a part
of its tail broken off before It was placed
In the warehouse.

this story can easily be satisfied by writ

PECULIAR TALE OF A MOOSE THAT PROVED A MONEY MAKER.
EVERYBODY who has hunted In
northern- Somerset County, Maine.,
In the j last Â«lx years has become .
morejor less acquainted v.-ith Bar- .
Ing.- the â¢ tame bull moose' that has ' lived
at Dave Joslin*s camp. Since the passage
cf the new code of game laws It has re
quired a, good deal of diplomacy for. a
Maine man to keep. a nioose in! captivity ,
without 1 coming Into conflict with the v.ar
dens.',Under.^the revised â¢' regulations . no^
cow moose" may. be k'Ued at any time}* n^, .

in the fall, and no moose of any, kind may
be held In< restraint under | penalty , of $103 *

Joslin found his moose when it was a :
calf/ The moose was stuck. in a hoc and
would have perished in a few days' If he
had not been rescued. He grew up among
the cattle on^ the farm, going and coming
as 'he 'pleased. Joslin was arrested, three
times for having; a .noose In his posses
sion contrary to law.
"I Jess wish you'd send a Sheriff up and
drive Baring off ter- tb" woods," he told
the Judge. "He's expensive, to, keep, -an*
I'm tco poor . to he 1 / him loafln' 'roiin'l'
doln' nothln* but ear up good hay. I'd a
shot him long-ago" If it hadn't been fer '
th* law, which will tine me- fer It."
The Sheriff and a oosae of men went to
Joalln's place three times In two years to
take the moose out of captivity. They led
the ; animal over hlile . and across rivers,"
taking; him fifty miles ,6r more : from his
old haunts before turning him loose. In
spite of their labors Baring: turned Up safe
and sound in Joslin's barnyard the next
morning; so when the wardens found they
could not dog the moose away they let
Joslin 'alone.
The turning â¢ point In Baring's career
came when he was two ysars of age. He
would go to the^paMure with the cattle
every morning, but soon after reaching
the enclosure he would Jump out and go
to the fields where there was better. feed.'
If the moose had made his calls on fields
In the neighborhood and kept out'of^Jos

trouble: but when " Baring began ". to crop ;
the string beans that were growing for
the purpose of fee.llng boarders at Jos
lln's camp It was a serious matter.
In the middle of September Barint:
found himself tied t-y a long line to a

a state of affairs (or which Barine" had

' t When Joslln readied the field he f9und
two moose tangled up in thirty feet of line
and flKhtlnp so earnestly" that neither paid
any attention to his approach.'. He. lib

were phot by the means of Baring's allur-
Ins voice Joslin will not: tell. -His camp
was filled with satisfied moose hunters for
four seasons, and last year he built a
large tenement house m the city of Au
burn, paying, for it from * the earnings- of
his tame moose."
. It sometimes happenecl that no hunter
was ; near Â¦ when a moose came forth - to
fight, In which case Bp.rlng was obllge'l
to settle the battle without help, which he
did by windlng.the iine around the antics
of his adversary and throwing him" to the
ground/ where Barlne could gore "and
trample upon him Tat leisure."
Last season ended c with - twenty-seven
bull * moose to Baring's credit.' every "one
of. which .was as good as> $50 clear profit to
Joslln. As Boon as the snow, fell and the
cattle were housed for the winter Baring
was set free* to go to *he woods and get
fat on messes 'and white maple bark, two
kinds of / food of which moose are very
fond.
For. three or four weeks the moose came
to his pen at-nlght anJl was shut up and
got his accustomed rations of hay and
raw potatoes. One night a'fter the b'.sr
snow in \ f January, Bating did Â¦ ; not com*?
home. .. Joslin waited Â¦ two weeks, hoping
that -he would turn \vtzt.-.- Then he hunted
a few days on snowshoes without result.
.Along In'. the. middle Â«f February he col
lected a crew of "men and "went out on a
determined search. The second day from
home the men found a- large moose yard,
holding" one.; male and eight females. On
thVapproach of the party the cows fled In
terror, but the bull stood his ground, com.
lnu^up and playfully' greeting- the men
with ' awkwbrd 'flourishes of head arid
heels; Joslln at once recognized, the head
of. the harem as Baring. ,
i,On Investigation he found the body of a
large, bull that had oefn slain In battle.
Joslln concluded that Baring had killed
the.'hcad of the-moos-3 family In a fair

"on the side, and it was served up' in the

. Mr.' Bowser felt a bit conscience strick
en about the cat and decided, to go around
to the house for a few minutes. As ha
reRched the gate -' he found , the ; feline sit

THE SUNDAY CALI*

MR. BOWSER'S TRIBULATIONSTHE SUNDAY; CALTi.?
8
DID you me*t Hon. John W. Foster,
America's greatest dlnlomat. white
he was herÂ«? If not. why. then,
you missed Fomethlns:.
Ho docs not cause a feeling of
profound awe to creep over you at flrnt
eight; but when he talks to you a while
you begin to see that the homely old ad
ape. "Still waters run deep," has lost noa<Â»
of Its force of late.
It peculiarly applies to Hon. John W
Foster.
Tcu drop In to hear him lecture. To l
Fee before you an Inoffensive-looking gen
tleman who talk? along, not In a Demos
thenic or Bryanesque manner, but In nn
ordinary conversational voice embellisht-1
by few gestures. Occasionally he raises
his voice suddenly and talks for a shcr
time In a slightly louder tone, which gives
you^the impression that there Is a" store
of latent energy concealed somewhere
about his person.
Mr. Foster Is a well Â«-et up gentleman.
Blight cf build, erect and with a certain
air cf alertness that is ready at a mo
ment's notice to change into one of in
scrutable passivity. He Is not a man to
â¢whom you would try to eell a gold brick.
I venture to assert that he never was ap
jiroached by a green goods man In all his
life; or. If he was. I am quite sure thÂ»
green goods nsan went away much sa-.l
â¢Jer. nrjeh wiser and with the firm reso
lution In his heart to forever abjure liv
ing by hi* wits and to hire out as a farm
hand and grow a circle of whiskers be
neath his chin.
But the moment you sÂ«e Mr. Foster you
Instinctively feel that he knows things
He is the Sir John of the stageâ good,
genial Sir John, with the white mustache
and side Â¦whiskers, aquiline nose and ir
reproachable black coat. You can almost
bear him saying "Bless you. my child
rear* Tou warm toward him unconscious
ly and feel that you'd like to have him
for a fatherâ or at least a rich uncle.
There are times when his rather small
eves suddenly twinkle and he takes h-s
glasses la his right hand and graceful! v
Â¦waves them in emphasizing his speech
You expect some humor when this be
gins â and you are not disappointed.
However. Sir John'sâpardon!âHonor
able John's humor Is not the kind that
lays hold of the risibilities r.nd jars them
loose from their foundations leaviag you
tearful and with a eideache. His genFe
sallies are subtle and insidious, making
y->u laugh a laugh that you enjoy ar.'S
feel good ever; but when he has liberate!
his little Joke he suddenly pets back be
hind that mask of inscrutability and yo-i
â¢wait with lively anticipation for him to
come out again.
"It is at such times that on? feels th.it
he might have made -a successful humor
ist. In fact, he bears the unmtstaVaW*
rtamp of a man who would be a capital
ttisry tellerâ if he were not a diplomat.
Diplomats do not tell stories. Quite the
contrary: they are fl*Â»voutlv believed to
tell the truth, the wh^Â» truthâ and a lit
tle more than the truth, it it comes to a
pinch!
And yet. â¢with all his likeness to R!f
John, and in spite of the fact that he has
been brought in contact with mnst r<t tha
courts of Europe n.n<l As<a. Mr. Foster,
both in speech and mannerism, is a typ

believe that a wonderful brain lies be

"Bit wtth your back to the lightâ anl

tnrfr when Â«peaVlnK ,of what it takes to
become a uueceiisful diplomat; but I lem
toward the opinion that there is a knack
âknown to dlploraats onlyâ whereby one
may tell the troth without putting tha
other fellow in a rag*â an accompliso
nsent that Is eo rare as to call forth our
tintfounded admiration whenever we con
template It. Tndecd. It is such a govj
thing that whenever we get In a tight
place we wcr.der vasruely whv Providence
reserved it for diplomats alone.
Still, perhaps it Is all for the best. If
rone but diplomats have the secret of be
ing afcle to tell the truth with impunity,
we plebeians may yet consols ourselvc
with the reflection that there . yet rc
rnalns for us the good old honest lie; so
we take heart and are ceiaferted,

The grip microbe was getting frisky In

returned the general. \ showing me to a
seat: "all In the life's business!"

quiry, "when I Â¦was appointed Mln!ster_ to
Mexico by President lirant. In 1SSO I w,v
made Minister to Russia, and In 18S3 was
transferred: to Madrid.; I .resigned thi?

by President Harrison to negitlai*
treaties of reciprocity with Spain. Ger

In 1S92 I succeeded. Mr. Blalne as Secre
tary of State and signed the first trea'.y

In 1F55 I was asked by the Emperor of
China to act as adviser, to Ll Huns Ching
!n the matter of the war between China
and Japan. In 1537 I was appointed by
President McKlnley as .special Embassa
dorto London and St. Petersburg and in
1JSS I was a member of the Anglo-Amer
ican Joint High Commission on Canadian
matters.".
This simple catalogue of one man's
achievements sounds easy. but. as merely
one Instance, let It be remembered that He
whispered into the ear of LI Hung Char.gr
the quiet tip which virtually ended the
war between China and Japan. This alone
would satisfy most men as the results of
a life's work.
"Speaking of LI Hung Chang." I ob
served, "and his reputation as a diplo
matist, how. in your estimation. doe,s he
rank among the great .diplomats of other
nations?"
"He doesn't rank at all." sa'd Mr. Fos
ter emphatically. "To be sure, LI Hung
Chang Is a great manâ probably the great
est in all the Chinese empire, but as for
a knowledge of International law and of
modern diplomacyâ he does not possess it!
Such ability as he does possess is almost
solely along the line of native shrewd
ness/' â â¢ -"Â¦> -~
"Craftiness?" 1 suggested.
"Wellâ perhaps."
"When did you first meet Li Hung
.
'Chans?" I asked.
"It was while on my trip around the
world. I met LI Hung Chang as I was
passing through Tientsin on my way to
Peking. He earned state, bringing along
a-Chinese band." .(Here Mr. Foster's eyes
glistened.) "We felt bound to do our best
to add to the festivities; so we had up
the Moncacy's band. It was a most in
teresting occasion when those two bands
got together!
"LI Hung Chang announced his desire
to give a banquet to our party â there were
five of us â and asked what time would be
agreeable. I accepted an invitation for a
day. following my return from P.eking.
"'Now. Ll Hung Chang was not
acquainted with American customs and
etiquette, and this gave rise to a rather
amusing circumstance.
â¢^Li had been informed that he was to
take Mrs. Foster out to dinner; so when
the hour arrived the old gentleman walked
up to the lady arid made a low bow. He
then marched away to the banquet hall
with Mrs. Foster following along be
hind. Following his lead, all the other
Chinese dignitaries approached the ladies
appointed to them, made low bows and
stalked away, each with a lady In his
wake.
"At table It was rather better: Ll Hung
Chang sat at the right of Mrs. Foster and
I opposite; but it was some days before
that solemn march to the banquet hall
ceased to be a standing joke among the
members of- the American contingent.
"Still it must be remembered' that this
was 'the first occasion upon which ladles
were ever invited to attend a public ban
cuet in China.
"Early In 1E95 I was requested by the
Emperor ef- China to assist LI Hung
Chang. It _was during, this visit that Li
and I eaw much of each other. Together
we went over to Shlmonosekl (Japan), oc
cupying the ' came -caiiln. It took two
steamers to 'carry 'our' suite.

"Beneath the picture 1 was 'my auto

"And to further illustrate the good feel

we were in Japan. Since we came home
he has always sent 1 us ; a card at Christ

Our conversation drifted around to the
condition of affairs in Spain. . "Judglnij

"do you think that Spain is in any seri

HfW^^ Life by Thorodike.THE recent balloon voyage of First (
Lieutenant von Hildebrandt of the
Royal Prussian Balloon Section and
Dr.' Bcrson. as described by the .
former in the German periodical, Die
Rundchau, Is of much Interest to balloon-
ists.
' Dr. Boreon already holds the record for
attaining the greatest height, 29,280 feel,
in his balloon ascension at Stassfurt. The"
Interest excited by this and similar "trips
to the higher atmosphere led to the for-
mation ' of an Internationar Aeronautic "
Commission, the purpose of which.'was'to'i
have a number of simultaneous ascensions
made at various . geographical -. points; In
Europe, thus the better to study the phy-
slcal properties'of the atmosphere'.'- Â¦ At
the meeting In September last at Paris it
was' agreed to make balloon ascensions on
the first Thursday; of every month.'On
January 10 lastja; great number" of such
ascenslons took'place, the most Interest-
ing of which was that'of Dr.'Berson and
Lieutenant von Hlldtcrandt.
' The ascension was'made at Berlin. Orig-
inally it was Intended to make as high an
ascension as possibie.'but a cloudless sky,/
the''possibility of remaining "a"'
long time at a low level without loss of
ballast, tempted the two observers to try
to cross the Baltic Sta.,
-There were several other favorable'clr-
cumstances.- In the first place the balloon
reached the coast without any loss of bal- .

ing .straight .the'.;Â¦'north,Tat low^

THE AERONAUT WHO HOLDS THE RECORD FOR GREATEST HEIGHT TAKES A TRIP
EQUALLY REMARKABLE FOR DISTANCE COVERED.
This unique headquarters of communi
cation Is conducted on the policy of sys
tem. ' method and concentration, or. in
other words, the idea Is to do away with
the necessity for a large force of opera
tives and to save time. Thus by means of
novel devices a half dozen telegraph
operators are enabled to do work which
under ordinary circumstances would re
quire from fifteen to twenty men. For
instance, there Is a switchboard accom
modating twenty wires, and by this means
â¢ It ; la possible to secure a direct wire to
any city In the country, and this may be
"held" for â¢ any length of time without
danger that any other than the official
business will go over it. Direct connec
tion may be made with any of the oceanic
cables, and, while It is customary to send
cablegrams through the New York offices
of the various cable companies, the oper
ators have under stress of unusual cir
cumstances .worked direct with the last
land offices of the cables at Sydney,
Cape Breton.
.â¢ Always in Touch. With President.
Most marvelous of all, perhaps. Is the
manner in which communication Is kept
up with the President when he Is travel
ing by rail. The White House office has a
complete itinerary of the trip, and â¢ by
means of a system of reports from train
dispatchers the exact location of the
Presidential train is always known and
a message may be placed in the hands of
the executive at almost any moment dur
ing the tour. But In the White House, as
elsewhere, telephonic communication is,
to a considerable extent, supplanting the
telegraph. In the bureau at the White
House is a cable box holding: fifteen tele
phone wires, and a long - distance tele
phone wire may be reserved exclusively
for the President's use, just as might a
telegraph line. For instance,' during the
President's vacation visits to Cantor,
when the various Cabinet officers went to
tho telegraph room to communicate with
him he has frequently talked direct to tha
White House for hours at a time.'
respondence at the White House Is the
secretary to the President. Until the days
of President Buchanan each incumbent
was obliged to provide his own secretary,
but from that time forward . Congress
made provision for this official. Originally
the salary was fixed at $2500 per year. Af
ter a score of years or so it was raised to
JC500, and during President Cleveland's
administration it was raised to $5000, at
which It remains to the present time.'
Nowadays the two assistant secretaries to
the President each receive more than did
the secretary of a quarter, century ago.
The secretary, of course, dictates all the
letters sent out, and, indeed, President
AicKinley writes but few letters with his
own band. Save in the case of communi
cations to close friends or relatives, he
the mall to gigantic proportions, and. af
ter President .' McKinley made public his
letter of acceptance in the summer of 1900,
there was received an* average of sixty
.congratulatory telegrams per day for tho
space of a. week.
Â¦ Of course only a small proportion of tho
letters which reach the White House
come under the eye of the President.
Scarcely a doxen a day. are such as to de
mand his personal attention, and mayhap
many of these may. be answered by the
private secretary, after consultation with
the Chief Executive. Naturally such in
junctions as "Personal" and "Private"
cannot be regarded in opening the White
House mail, and many expedients aro
adopted by prominent men who send let
ters which they do not desire to have pc
â¢rused .by.any person save the chief- offi
cer of the republic. 'A~ favorite plan ia for
the writer to place his Initials in auto
graph in the lower left-hand corner of
the envelope. All the clerks have come to
recognize the Initials of the men close to
the President, and their letters go throus'n
without molestation.
The man who bears the brunt of the cor-
This Is only a small portion of the m>
prising: things Which are being accom
plished by means' of the telephone at tin
White House. There are private telephona
wires connecting the Executive Mansion
-with the Senate and House of Represen
tatives, so that the President may talk
confidentially with the Vice President or
any member of Congress: but surpassing
tbis In point of Insuring secrecy Is a pecu
liar telephone system which connects the
President with the offices of the various
members of the Cabinet. This Is auto
matic In Its action; the central station be
ing In the garret of the White House, and
there la. consequently, no "hello girl" to
overbear any secrets of state.
. Some absolutely original expedients
have been resoryd to In this wizard cabf- !
net of tbe "White House In emergencies. ;
On some occasions an operator receiving
a long telephonic message would repeat
It word b7 word to a graphophone, to bÂ«
transcribed to tbe President at bis leisure,
and more wonderful still, graphophones
carefully gauged as to speed have beea
made to record long messages clicked off-c*
b'v Â¦Â¦- the telegraph Instruments. Tbik v
scheme can be resorted to when the om>e 1
Is rushed with work, the operators trans- \
crlblng the records on tbe various cylin
ders at their leisure.
' The telegraphic messages which come tÂ«
the "White House may ba in on* of .ten
different codes. The State Department,
the War Department and the Navy T>^Z
par tmeat each . has three different codes*
and tbe President has. a private code. Ao
operator will, as a rule, recognize ln
ctantly what code Is being used. If a sus
picion arises that a code has been, discov
ered by any person outside the proper ao
thoritie's it may be changed at any time,
as. for Instance, during the Chines*
trouble, wben It was suspected that ;tÂ£e
Celestials had obtained possession of a
copy of the State Department code. The
telegraph operators stationed at the "Whits
House are the very pick of the profession.
They always take messages direct from
the wire to a. typewritez. and a speed of
seventy words per minute Is not account
ed anything out of the ordinary. The
operators work In three "shifts." the
hours being from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m_. 5 p. m.
to midnight and midnight to 9 a. m. iÂ»
ipectively. There axe usually four men on
duty an the time, although, the number
has ranged as high as eight or tea mea
- p er "shift," making a total force of trom
twenty-fonr to thirty men.
Maintaining Secrecy.
The precaution* for maintaining Â«eerÂ«cy
as to the contents of official message* are.
of course, elaborateâ how elaborate majr
be Imagined from the total absence â¢*:
"leaks'* of any kind, notwithstanding the
fact that advance information as to gov
ernmental action would frequently mean %
profit of millions of dollars for Its fortu
nate possessor in Wall street. In the first
place, the most unQuestlosable credentials
are necessary In order to obtain admis
sion to the Telegraph Bureau at an. Tba
precautions taken in the case of the tile
phone system connecting the White House
with thÂ« desks of the Cabinet offlccr*
have already been explained/ and the tile
graph operators use what are known "as
secret sounders, so ' that even were an
other telegrapher in the room, he could
not ascertain what was passing over the
vires. Finally, the White House opera
tors Invariably know Just who is taking
their messages at the other end of the
line, and if the communication is one of'
Importance they are likely to can for a
man In whom they can repose confidence,
.Â«. One of the oiHcers who plays an impor
tant part In spending the money which tt
costs to maintain the White House Is the
steward. -The entire domestlo disburse
ment la under the control of this dlgnl
tary, who is heavily bonded and receives
a salary of J1SQO per year. The steward
engages all the White House servants,
save the chef, coachman and footman,
who are hired and paid by the President.
The steward also purchases all the sup
plies for the White House table and re
plenishes household stores when neces- .
sary. but he is held to strict account for
all expenditures and must even report at
the end of the "year the breakage of china.
Congress makes a yearly appropriation of
$Â£000 for the housekeeping : equipment of i
the White House, but the President must
pay for the subsistence of his family and,
all the domestic employes..
There are minor details in the manage
ment of the home of America's chief ex-*
ecutlve. Several ' persona are employed
regularly In the laundry, and the same is
true .'of the conservatory, ' The White
House stable also requires the services
of a number of men. In addition to the
coachmen and footmen. There are al3o
oven the man who Is aeijt once each week
to wind the thirty " clocks^ In the "White
House, and the disbursing officer of tha
Presidential house, who pays almost every
- person connected with the mansion save
the President, who receives on the "first
day of each month, direct from the tre&o
1 *ury, a check for more than 14008,
ing teen necessary on occasions to "bor
row" clerks f rom somo of the departments
Any unusual event is liable to overwhelm
the correspondence, bureau at the White
Hcuee. For Instance, during the Spanish-
Ainerlcan 'war' the Inquiries of solicitous
relatives for the men at the front swelled.
There are never less than three stenog
raphers at work answering the Presi
dent's correspondence, and frequently
there are several times that number, it hav-
the Government departments, had not the
writer imagined that something was to be
gained by securing the ear of the Chief
Executive. These misdirected epistles
are dispatched forthwith to the,head
quarters of that branch of. the Govern
ment service with which they are i con
cerned;'l>ut inasmuch as It is the policy
of the present administration to acknowl
edge the receipt of every letter which
con:es to the White House the outgoing
mail is always as large as and usually
larger than that received.
The of the mail at the White
Hcuse Is a \Hs task. A wagon from the,
general postofflce calls at the White
House three times each dayâ morning,
noon and afternoonâ and seldom does a
day pass that less than 150 letters are de
livered, trt say nothing of hundreds of
papers and periodicals of various kinds.
In times when public feeling nms high, as
during the recent Chinese crisis, the dally
mail frequently runs up to KK> or GOO let
ters. As a matter of fact, many of the
letters which come to the White House
ebould have been directed to some one of
Bave for the interval of lunch time it is
likely to be continued without Interrup
tion until late in the afternoon. On Tues
day and Friday mornings there are Cabi
net meetings, and when Congress is In
session the President sets apart several
hours each day. during whicn he Is acces
eTble to members of either House. Finally
there Is the hour when any citizen having
business with the President may call.
How carefully the programme of the
Chief Executive Is mapped out may be
realized when it is stated that the Presi
dent devotes a specified time daily to
affixing his signature to papers of state
end the commissions of army, navy and
other officers bearing Presidential ap
pointments, including the four thousand
Presidential postmasters.
Immediately after breakfast, and. after' a
glance through the morning papers, takes
up the work of the day.
To watch the conduct of business at the
White House through the daylight hours
of one day is to gain a 'better idea of how
manifold are the Interests of the Govern
ment than may be obtained anywhere else
In Washington. The Presidential offices
may be said never to be closed durtnsr- a
s'.rgle hour in the year, for there is some
branch of them alwaj-3 open. If It be only

tle more than half what it *Jd during
Grant's occupancy. It Is estimated that
for the year which -will end during the
summer of 1902 It will cost $30,000 to care
for the Executive Mansion, with an addi
tional $13,000 for the lighting of the house
and grounds. i, ".**-.,; '".-v.V-; ; ; v, "'Â¦'

Managing Receptions.
: One phase of the business management
of the White House which might appear
Insignificant and unsuitable to classifica
tion under this head, but which is hevet
theless difficult and . perplexing, is the
conduct of ebc'al affairs. The secretary
to the President- and the engineer officer
in charge of the White House and
grounds wrestle with this problem jointly.
The worst phase of the matter is found In
the overwhelming and never - ending
avalanche of persistent people who seem
willing to move heaven and earth to se
cure an Invitation to a social function at
th White House. Not only | must -the
g. anting and refusal of requests and com-
plaints- made ,^by, letter, and otherwise'be . :
kept from the President and his wife, but
a nicety of decision* is neces
sary In sending out invitations for state
dinners, etc. Finally, there are the' re-*'
quests from delegations of all Imaginable
kinds /visiting Washington that the Presi
dent .tender a reception to each partlcu- \
lar party. v
Decidedly the most wonderful feature of -.
the working; apartments- of the ' White
House,' however/ is the telephone and tele-
graph room, or the telegraphi and cipher
bureau of the .executive, office, as It Is
officially designated. The room Is In
charge of a United States signal corps
officer. Colonel Benjamin F. Montgomery,
who has been detailed for the work. This
rather \\ small apartment has been aptly
termed the J'nerve center of seventy mil
lion people," and. indeed. Its sympathetic
nerves cover the plove. It is the only
telegraph ofllce* In the Government which
is never closed.. .It keeps communication
open between the White House " and the
President, wherever he may be; it trans
mits the confidential messages "from the
Government to American army and navy
officers and diplomatic representatives

THE BUSINESS END OF THE WHITE HOUSETHE DEADLIEST SPOT IN AMERICA
DEATH GULCH is the name given
by those living near it to a ravine
in the northeastern corner of the
Yellowstone National Park, in Wy
oming. Grewsome as is tho name, it is
exceedingly appropriate. It is a* V-shaped
trench cut in the mountain side, arid be
gins about 250 feet above Cache : Creek.
Apparently it. forms a natural shelter for .
the beasts of the forest, as food, water
and shelter are there, but entrance -to the
gulch means death to any animal, for the
poisonous yapors that rise out of ! the
ravine are more deadly than the bullets
of. the huntsmen. ,
Various expeditions under the direction
of thÂ© United States Geological Survey
have reported as to the characteristics of
Death Gulch, the last; being by Harvey â¢:
"W. Weed. He said that he had tested thÂ©
hollows in . the gulch for carbonic add
gas- without proving its presence. The
atmosphere In the gulch, however, ; . was;
oppressive. There ;was ,a Â¦ strong smell of
sulphur, and he Buffered from a choking
sensation, although a strong wind pre-,'
vailed at the time.- At the bottom of the
gulch were the carcasses ; of many ani
mals, some of which had met death* but
a short time before/ .These "carcasses were
of bear, elk, hares, squirrels, 1 etc.
Mr. -Weed examined : , the - body; of a
grizzly, which . evidently had died but a
day before, as Its tracks were, quite dis
tinct and perfectly fresh. There was some
blood under the nose. Nothing, more.
, Later on Charles E. : George arid a Mr.
Everett, of Boston .visited; the gulch and
made ari'extended examination. They de
clare; the gulch i Is a death trap, r which, Â¦
while different in many ways from the
famous Death Valley of -'Java, is as cer
tain, in its effect. -At one end the gulch :1s
comparatively open and the wind sweeps
through, but at- the : other, it forms
a: ravine/; the gases accumulate and as
phyxiate-all "animals 'that -'come -within
the walls of .rock.' When Mr.: George and
Mr. Everett 1 entered the gulch . the gaseous
fumes were so oppressive that | they had
difficulty.; in^ breathing, yet ; they 5 entered
at theend. where the gulch is Â¦practically
open:' .They lit a wax' taper,*and: found
that when'placed more; than forty Inches
from the ground It was extinguished. , This
proved the 'existence of carbon dioxide
gas."- â¢; Â¦Â¦,", :. : ' 'Â¦"'
: - The bed of the gulch and .ravine .was
littered with the .bones and 'skins of ani

After this entertainment the boys cam*

at the cost of $20,000.
The settlement work has been going on
Jin the south part of the city for a good
roany years now, but It has now and
acala had a hard time to make a live of
tt. The workers worked, but that was
not enough. Money was the thing- needed.
The leaders of the clubs are working
XTfca Trojans to keep things going, giving
tip evenings when they might have been
" at the theater or at a whist party. Some
- -were giving their whole time, living In the
" settlement and holding the dubs together

eaouth. The meetings had to be held In
asy scattered rooms that could be hadâ
over stores or In remote houses. They
were Illy fitted for the needs of the work
ers. Money was the thing wanted.
Then In stepped Mrs. Hearst, as she has
a way of Â£olQg. She felt In her pocket,
palled out a J20.000 bill, andâ there you
are.
It Is all smooth sailing now. The two

and fitted out completely have been
opened now, and the clubs are getting set
tled *n their new quarters.
Tou will find these buildings at 86 South
Park, right at the corner of a cross street,

air and the sunshine are quite as chummy
In South' Park as anywhere else. If they
only have a chance. :
The building that you enter first, the one
, that has S6 painted on Its transom.' Is
1 called the settlement house. Behind this
Is Bhaw gymnasium, which name covers a
multitude of good things. The two to

are quite as likely to discuss real measles
and wHooplng cough, for they turn Into

their own baby clothes, and they often
come to a club 'meeting with a' baby in
their arms. Â¦
On one side of the hall are the two large
rooms devoted to the Mothers' Club; Mrs.

On this day the church s vestments are

lights are ablaze on the altar and the
music of the mass is joyful. But the

tragedy. But first Fhe must honor Him
Â¦writh fitting reverence, the more to pro

the first holy week.
And ko it happens that a very ancient
end strikingly beautiful custom .in the
church of Rome takes place every year.
It is called ihe Holy Thursday procession.
People travel from early morning until
late in the .evening to witness it and to
tee the gorgeous 'decorations that form
f u<-h a feature of the day.
First in order are placed a *core or two

Their sweet faces are partially hidden by
long white veils, which are held in place

church uncovered.
Following them come the altar boys.

snakes are disproportionately short ar.J
thick. The puff adder grts his name- from
his peculiar habit of inflating himself
when angry. He is an impudent fellow,
with a rusty black coat, pugnacious, es- -
pecially in" early spring. If you trespass
upon his beat he will dart at you, swelling
.visibly, hissing loud and darting out Ma
wicked-looking forked tongue- But he is
for all that an arrant coward, as bluster-
Ing braggarts are apt to be. If you run
he will chase you, but If you stand your
ground, or make a motion to strike him
he shrinks one-half and scuttles off to ths*
thickest cover.
Still hÂ» is not so Queer as the glass
snake or joint snake, of whom the book
men are still incredulous. Ha exists, for
all that, not too plentifully, to be- sure,
but in reasonable numbers, all along the
historic parallel, 36 degrees 30 minutes.
That is to say, from tho Carolina seaboard
to the western edge of Arkansas and Mis
souri. If ho extends farther west the fact
has not been reported. He is brown, a
eort of earth brown.'Vith a deeper black
lsh-brown stripe down the middle of- his
back. His coat is not scaly. Instead, it
is glassy smooth. He has a perfectly flat.
triangular head, and runs with lncredlblo
swiftness. It is almost Idle to think oS
catching: him in midsummer or autumn.
The best time to observe his peculiar wayi
Is early springy Just as the plow turns him
out into a raw March world.
At first he looks and acts like any tor
pid serpent. By and by. when the sun hat
a little enlivened him, nettle him with
light blows from a keen switch, and â¢
watch what happens. At the first ha starts
a bit, the second makes him sQuIrra, tha
third sets him shivering throughout hli
length. Then he begins to think there
must be something doing. The something
is to cast off a Joint or so of himself, and
scuttle away as best he can. It pursued
he casts off other Joints until only his
head remain. The remnant Is stout and
thick. It has need to be, since into it are
crowded a full set of snaka vitals.
Once safe away the snake lies <jni,Â»t a
bit in the sunshine. Then If thare Is no
further alarm, be crawls back eeekfnr tha
fragments of himself. He seems to fol
low his own trail, no matter how devious,
and as soon as he comas to a cast-a K
Joint, backs himself against It. and re-at â¢
taches it. This keeps up until he Is mads
whole. Evidently the reconstruction Is an
exhausting process, as after It tha reptila
will lie perfectly still for/hours, unless
roughly disturbed. 'â¢
In all natures mechanism are few
things more deft or better contrived than
the provision for casting oft these Joint*
and picking them up aÂ»~aln. The first ot
them, the tall tip.' Is. of course, the small
est. At the break tha end of it fits accur
ately within a projecting ring scale. There
are further three small holes In the faca
of it ' to receive three small gristly pro
jections from the other Â¦ process.' Every
Joint is the same. But at breaking apart
they do. not bleed." Indeed there is no
evidence of any sort of circulation. Tet
circulation there must be, else the do â¢
tachablÂ© Joints could not be nourished.
There* are from four to seven joints la the
back of the snake, varying less, according
to size than to habitat. Sometimes tha
joint snake" reaches a. length , of six fact.
' But commonly he is iesa than thret.

"A snake's tail never dies till after sun-,
down." That is an article of rural faith.
By way of re-enforcing it, it may be saJl
that with some specie3 of snakes a sev
ered head bites an hour or even two after
cutting off, and further, that the headless
body will often leap its own length If irr 5 
tated. That is not, however, o;ulte so
strange as that the leap is made toward
the Irritatorâ as though the body could
still measure distance and direction with
out eye, ears or brain.. .
All snakes lay eggs. Some snakes hatch
out their . eggs before, depositing them.
Thus there is a distinction. The egg-lay
ers are said. to be oviparous, and others
ovovivlparoua. Viper, indeed, Is derived
from that reptile's supposed habit of pro
ducing Its young alive. But no matter
what the species, every snake egg as
soon as formed begins to hatch. Thus it
matters little as to when or how they are
extruded. â¢ Barring accident, there* Is very
Burs to bo a fins brood of young snakes
at a very early i data. While the. young
snakes ara very small ths mother reptile
guards them vigilantly. Upon the ap
proach of imminent danger she opens her
mouth and lets her young run down her
throat. The fact was for a long time dis
puted and reckoned only rural fable. By
a comparison/ tabulation and verification
of actual observations, extending to more
than 100 cases, it has been established bo
yond cavil.
Pythons brood their eegs. arranÂ«toÂ«
them in a pyramid, and winding them
selves around the pyramid in a sort of
Turk's cap snaps. This even In captivity.
There, however.': the eggs almost never
hatch. The period of incubation la fifty
odd days, throughout which the brooding
python eats nothing, though she will drink
thirstily if water or milk ia provided so
she may reach it without stirring her
folds.
Viper eggs are commonly linked into. a
sort of chain, but not invariably. Other
snakes .. sometimes lay linked . eggs, but
of tener single ; ones. The size of snaka
eggsis strictly proportionate to that of
the; species. Occasionally a snake shows
attachment to her Â¦ unhatched - eggs, , but
commonly she runs i away; from - them .lit

IT Is Quite natural that the younger
generation of theater-goers should find
It difficult to locate the sites of a ma
jority of the theaters built during the
flret ten years of San Francisco's his
tory. Only those who were familiar with
the business districts before Montgomery
avenue was cut through diagonally from
the corner of Montgomery and Washing
ton Btreeta can remember with anything
like certainty just where the vanished
theaters stood, and it is amusing to see
how easily old-timers are confused or
mistaken as to the exact location of the
places they knew so well from a quarter
to a half century ago. Early in the '70's
the opening of Montgomery avenue
charged the topography of the neighbor
hood material! v by cutting off coiners and
obliterating some of the ancient land
marks on the west side of Montgomery
street. About as pretty, an argument as
one would wish to hear may easily be
started by gett'r.g into a gathering of old
pioneers and asking anybody where the
stage door or the gallery entrance of the
early theaters were. In the end there is
pretty sure to be an argument upon the
location, but there will be something like
a picnic before the opinion is unanimous,
and the searcher for information will be
surprised to learn how long it takes to
get the old memories in working order.
While there were no new theaters built
In San Francisco during '56 and 'Zt. sev
eral changes in name and management
must be noted to avoid confusion. On the
29th of November the name Majruire's
Opera-house was adopted at San Francis
co Hall, and. Concert Hall was opened
January 16, 1SS7. on the corner of Clay
and Saneome streets. The first entertain
ment was a diorama - of Bunker Hill,
â¢which was consolidated subsequently with
a minstrel company, and the hall was oc
cupied a short time after by a. panorama
cf the principal incidents in the crusado
of the vigilance committee. Two attempts
were made by Incendiaries to destroy the
panorama. Tho second, on May 11. was
successful, and Concert Hall Xcr the tima

a capacity for handling' ten thousand

Company has a number of ships which, in
the event of the deal. It will sell out to the
syndicate. It Â»also owns several small
canneries in Alaska.
Should! the promoters of this syndicate
succeed, In their scheme this will be. one
of the largest commercial deals ever made
on'the Pacific Coast and means that the
salmon* canning industry will be convert
ed '.Jhto".a\ big trust. It will of course
mean the elimination of a number of the
smaller 'establishments and* the concen
tration: of the industry "at a few central
points. ' This would- mean the saving of
thousands of dollars to the syndicate,
which'. could also dictate' the price for
packed salmon. Â¦"Â¦ â¢ ; ;
but I did not seo him and he left after
making a few inquiries from the secretary
of my company. It may be possible that
a syndicate is being formed to control the
whole salmon packing Industry, but at
present we are not In the deal. I should
think, though, that with the exception of
my company an 'option could be secured
on every other cannery on the coast.
"If " Eastern capitalists* ' attention ' haa
been drawn to the coast and to the salmon
packing industry here I can readily under
stand H. This last year we had a large
supply ' of canned " salmon Â¦ on hand,- but
more than any other year. We made a
market price for the goods, which was
universally adopted. I mean by that we
placed a fair profit on our goods and tho
other canneries all fell In line. From this
step It may - be - that ; Kastern capitalists
were surprised to see such, a small con
cern as ours could dictate the price to ther
world.
"To answer the question whether wÂ»'
will sell out Is a hard matter. I suppose
anybody will sell anything if he gets tho
price he wants, and yet for Instance then*
are some things that you don't want to
sell at any price. I don't know whether
we would sell out or not. Nobody has
come and 'made us an offer, so what is the
good of asking?
"R. Onffrey I know by reputation as an
officer of the Pacific -American Fisheries
Association. I have never met him, but
my opinion is that he Is the promoter of,
this syndicate. Should he be successful 1
in securing the option on all the canneries
on the coast In my opinion he will go back
to New York and Inform the financiers.
Could he go back and place before them
this proposition they might possibly, buy;

MANILA, March 30. â In company with
Colonel Vellla.hls cMef of staff, and Dr.
Barcelona," ex-treasurer of the Filipino
government, Agulnaldo now occupies one
of the nicest apartments of the Malaca
nang palace. ' He is closely ' guarded and
courteously treated. He spends much
time seated by a barred window, watch
ing" the boats passing up and down tho
Pasig River.
This morning Aguinaldo was recognized
by a crowd of natives going tip the river
in a lighter. The natives gazed at him a
while In silence and then began to jeer,
calling him Emilio and vile names in the
Tagalog language. Â¦ The guards quieted
the ' disturbance and Agulnaldo' left' the
window in disgust.
' The natives In Manila are undemonstra

it Is difficult to ascertain what the ma

Filipinos generally with what he has done
and bis \iews as to their future course.
Amnesty, for Aguinaldo.
It was explained : to-day that, notwith
standing the fact that Aguinaldo was cap
tured, the President: holds that his case
comes within the scope . of the amnesty
proclamation Issued by General Mac-
Arthur last summer and the enabling act
recently passed by the Philippines Com
mission, which proviiied ."that all persons
who on the 1st day of April, 1901, or there
after shall be in arms against the au
thority and sovereignty of ..the United
States In the Philippine Islands and all
persons aiding and abetting them' oh and
after said date, are , hereby . declared to
be ineligible to hold any office of honor,
trust or profit In the Philippine Islands."
Agulnaldo's fate depends to a great ex
tent upon .Agulnaldo.'. If he Is disposed to
meet the President half way lie will find
that the American executive will not be
backward. It may be that eventually be
will be given an office, the authorities
holding that he is eligible under the terms
of the enabling act, but this is regarded
as a remote contingency. Before obtain
ing his freedom Aguinaldo must give con
vincing assurances of his loyalty. The
amnesty proclamation excepts from its
application "persons who. have violated
the laws of war during the 'period 'of ac
tive hostilities."
No Trial for - the Present."
Army officers say no difficulty would be
experienced In obtaining all ibit{ proof
that might be required for, the .conviction
of Agulnaldo In case It were ; desired to
punish him. Attention was . called
to the proclamation issued. by Agulnaldo
soon after..the .outbreak of 'the ' Insurrec
tion directing the "extermination |of
Americans." 'Â¦ â¢ 'â¢ - ' â¢ -. â¢
"Philippine families only will be, respect
ed," the proclamation .directed.' "They
should, not be molested, but all; other in
dividuals,* of whatever race' they, niay be,
will be exterminated' without" any .'ccm
passionby the army, of liberation."
Should â¢ Agulnaldo prove* unwilling -to
take advantage of the generous . policy, of
the United States, the military commis
sion, which would try him on the* charges
growing out of his conduct, during the in
surrection, would probably Â¦ recommend
his deportation to Guam. There will be^rio

WASHINGTON. March 29.â The
following- important army ap
pointments were announced at
the White House to-njght: Â»
To be major general. United
States Armyâ Brigadier General Lloyd
Wheaton, vice Miles, promoted to lieu
tenant general.
To bÂ« brigadier generals in regular
armyâ Colonel Jacob II. Smith, Seven
teenth United States Infantry, brigadier
general of volunteers, vice Daggett, re
tired; Brigadier General Frederick Fun-
Eton, United States Volunteers, vice
Wheaton, promoted.
The announcement of these appoint
ments was made after a conference be
tween the President, Secretary Root and
Adjutant General Corbln, and at the same
time the long expected list of appoint
ments of majors and captains in the Pay
masters, Quartermaster's and Commis
sary departments, and of chaplains, was
made known. The list Included two ma
jors and twenty-five captains in the Pay
master's Department; twenty-one cap
tains in the Commissary Department, and
seventeen " chaplains. All of these ap
pointees are in the regular army under the
recent act of Congress enlarging and re
organizing the army, and without excep
tion the staff appointees are from volun
teer organizations. The chief Interest,
however, centers in the three appoint
ments of major general and two brigadier
generals, and more particularly in the
selection of General Funston after his
brilliant exploit in capturing Agulnaldo.
Following the announcement General
Corbln sent the following to General Mac-
Arthur: ' â¢ â¢
"WASHINGTON, March ' 3O.-Mac

CAI4i BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON. March 30.â If EmUo
Agulnaldo has violated any of the lawa
pf war and declines to take the oath of
allegiance to the United States he will
be tried by a military commission to be
appointed by Major General MacArthur.
This is the important feature of the In
etructions sent by Secretary Root to Gen
eral MacArthur to-day regarding the dis
position to be made of the prisoner. Gen
eral MacArthur will make no bargain with
Aguinaldo giving aim freedom in return
for aid In establishing a recognition of
American sovereignty. He will inform
that the Government is dis
posed to deal leniently with him and he
will be held for the present as a prisoner
cf war. He will be kept under,close.sur
veillance. 80 as not to be able to com
municate with bis former subordinates to
the injury of the United States. He will
be allOTed, if he desires, to take the oath
of allegiance and then to acquaint the
treasonable communication with the in
surgents still in arms.
The tardy recognition to Brigadier Gen
eral Funston nas at last been granted. by
the War Department. Adjutant General

NEW YORK, March 3O.-Mrs. Esther

aged 5, and Sophia, aged 1â perished by
the burning of a flve-story tenement
house at Delancey and Norfolk streets
early to-day. In the panlo which occurred
other mothers lost their reason and thre
their children . from the windows to the
street below, j That all were caught by
the police and firemen and escaped'seripus
injury seems almost a miracle. The fol
lowing is the list of the Injured:
Max Salisburg, aged 20, burned about
the face, hands and 'body. .
John J. Reardon, detective, cut on hands
and face by falling .glass. . â¢
Michael Oestfeldt, suffering from shock
and contusions.
There were thirteen families Â¦ in the
house. The fire was discovered at 3:30
o'clock by the wife of the Janitor, who
aroused her husband, and together they
went to the front of the house, giving the
alarm. On the top floor of the tenement
lived Morris Cohen, his wife and their
childrenâ Sophia. Harry and Benjamin.
The flames were already through the roof
when they, were awakened. Escape by
the hallway was cut off. Groping their
way through the smoke to the window,
Cohen picked up the boy Harry and. call T
ing to his wife to follow, got out on the
fire escape and started to descend. Mrs.
Cohen carried the baby In her arms and
the boy Benjamin followed. Out on the
fire escape the flames and â¢ smoke which
burst from the windows below them sep
arated tho members of the family, and
only Cohen and the boy reached the
street. When the firemen were finally
able to reach the .top floor they found
tho bodies of Mrs. Cohen and the other
two children, blackened and burned, lying
on the fire escape landing.
The damage by the fire is estimated at
$10,000. Â¦--Â¦

considerable complaint of some loafers in

vulgar talk. To-day Mrs. J. M. Smith
took her husband's razor strap and a

LONDON, March 30.â The . diary of
Major Andre, after lying hidden for a
hundred years, has been 'discovered in
England. This interesting find was made
by Lord Grey the other day while he was
going over a lot of old family papers that
probably had not been disturbed since
the conclusion of the American war of
independence.
Lcrd Grey's great grandfather was a
commander of British troops in America
at that time, and Andre- served on his
staff. .This accounts for the diary being
in the possession of the present peer. The
diary is apparently the original, but In
order to make sure that it is not a copy
Lord Grey is' sending over to the United
States to secure samples of Andre's hand
writing, none of which can be obtained
here.
-The diary Is a story of the campaign,
day by day, during the years 1777-1778. It
is simply but interestingly told from the
soldier's standpoint and is accompanied
by maps, apparently drawn by Andre him
self with a skill that would make him
the equal of any military hydrographer
of to-day.
The diary ceases too early to throw new
lipht upon the motives which prompted
the tragic ending of his career, but it
gives interesting glimpses of the person
ality of one of the historic figures of the
revolution.

Whether the. conditions should be ex
acted from the King or whether the Lib
erals must frankly appeal to the country
for the practical abolition of the Houae
of Lords is not quite clear. But anyway,
as the Daily News says, "It is a bold and
somewhat startling suggestion in which
Mr. Gladstone seems to have put his fln
ger on the weak spot of modern liberal
ism."
"The Irish question is more to the front
than ever and the Government seems to
view it with aoathotlc impotence. Tho
advocates of the Liberals are not en
deavoring: to take up the Government's
burden. until they have exacted conditions
that their policy will not again be stulti
fied by the rejection of their measures oy
the House of Lords."
"The war in South Africa will cost not
far short of two hundred millions and the
settlement seems as far off as ever. There
are problems to be salved in the Par East
of the first magnitude and the Govern
ment appears destitute of a clear, settled
policy. Already the huge expenditure for
the army and navy Is going up by. leaps
and bounds and will force Eurose to add
to its ruinously large armaments. Where
is it to end? ,
Liberals can unite against what even the
Conservative organs admit to be the weak
management of the paity in power." The
letter is short. Its quality can be judged
from the following excerpts:

WASHINGTON. March 30.â On account
of the reported existence of rinderpest In
the Philippine Islands, Secretary Wilson
some time ago recommended to the Sec
retary of War that such action be taken
as might be necessary to prevent the in
troduction of the contagion into the Ha
waiian islands and the United States by
animals brought on Government trans
ports. He also requested the Secretary
of the Treasury to direct that special pre
cautions be taken on the Pacific Coast to
prevent the landing of susceptible ani
mals without their betng turned over to
the Department of Agriculture for quar
antine under the supervision of the
Bureau of Animal Industry. Secretary
Wilson has received replies from Secre
tary Root and Secretary Gage informing
him . that the desired instructions have
been issued. ' !
Rinderpest is the great cattle plague of
Oriental countries, which has frequently
swept over Europe, destroying nearly all
bovine animals, and has attracted special
attention during the past two or three
years by its ravages In Africa, where in
many sections it destroyed from 90 to 95
per cent of all the cattle. Although inocu
lation at last has been so far efficacious
as -somewhat to reduce the losses from
this disease. It still remains one of the
most fatal diseases to cattle. .-
Government Pears That the Cattle
Plague of the Orient May Find
a Loophole.
PRECAUTION IS TAKEN
AGAINST THE RINDERPEST
Regarding Chinese Indemnity and the
mode of apportioning it, there is no di
vergence of opinion between the United
States and Germany, notwithstanding nu
merous statements to the contrary. The
American embassy and the German For
eign office hold almost dally conferences
on the subject of China, hitherto always
leading to mutual understanding.
Emperor William unveiled to-day monu
ments to . the Great Elector. Frederick
William, and to William the Great. Noth
ing unusual occurred at the ceremony.
It is said in official circles that the
negotiations at Peking are now*wholly
confined to the details of questions re
garding the indemnity, etc., and . that
nothing ' of importance is transpiring
there. Germany does not know whether
the Russo-China Manchurlan convention
has been signed or not. Officials here re
gard the Korean question to be progress
ing satisfactorily find do not believe Ja
pan will become aggresslvo in {he matter.
The Vorwaerts is of the opinion that the
Emperor's speeches are momentary signs
of mental depression, occasioned by the
Bremen outrage, which the Emperor con
tinues to attribute to a deep laid plan In
stead of regarding it ns the irresponsible
deed of an epHeptlc. This opinion Is sys
tematically strengthened by the Conserva
tive press, clippings from which persons
of the Emperor's entourage take care reg
ularly to place before liim:
Outside of Prussia the disapproval by
the press,, including the semi-official news
papers, of the Emperor's sensational
speeches ie even greater. The comments
of the Stuttgart Schwaebische Merourare
are to the effect that the speeches are
calculated to arouse widespread misun
derstandings. The semi-cmcial newspaper
of Augsburg the Abend Zeltung, says the
speeches will nil every patriot with deep
est regrets and greatest fears for the fu
ture, and awaken the fear that the Bre
men incident has bred images in the Em
peror's mind which are the product of an
over-excited fancy. The Munich Neueste
Nachrichten says it is impossible to pro
mote monarchlal sentiments when the na
tion 1p systematically misunderstood, in
sulted and debased before the world by its
own Emperor. .
In. the House of Lords Professor Fried
ler, rector of the Charlottenburg Techni
cal High School, made a powerful speech
against the Prussian Minister of Justice,
Dr. Schlenstedt, charging him* and the
Prussian bureaucracy with trying to de
feat again Emperor William's school re
form, favoring natural sciences and mod
ern languages against ancient languages
and training in the. present gymnasiums.
The Minister weakly . denied the charge.
BERLIN, Match 30. â Emperor William's
speeches at the - dedication of the new
barracks near the imperial castle of the
Emperor Alexander Grenadier Regiment
are still the sensation of the hour. The
Vorwaerts to-day vouches lor Its sharpest
version of Â¦ his Majesty's, speech. . The.
Hamburg correspondent also Bays that
the version published by the Kreuz Zel
tung is much milder than the Emperor's
original words.
The press is 'still puzzling over what
caused Emperor William to recently in
dulge in such pessimistic talk, and consid
ers his words to be unwarranted by facts.
They point out also that the Emperor's
prediction In answering a toast Thursday
night to the effect that Germany would
soon have- to right against overwhelming
odds is at variance with all the declara
tions of Count von Bulow, the Imperial
Chancellor, who represents Germany as
surrounded by friends. -. -
The Vbssische Zeitungr and the Berliner
Tageblatt attribute the depression of the
Emperor, which inspired these speeches,
to recent determining influences and "Ir
responsible advisers.* 1 by which they re
fer to. Dr. von Lucanus, the head of his
Majesty's civil Cabinet; General von
Hahnke, the chief of his Majesty's mili
tary Cabinet; Admiral von Blbran, chief
of the marine Cabinet; the adjutant gen
eral and others, who most systematically
misrepresent the actual internal situation,
especially with regard to the Socialists.

The guests drank to the health of Gen

marks were brief but eloquent. Upon his
departure for the Southwest, he said, he
f eft â¢ a kindly feeling for Omaha, - whose
cit'rens had proven themselves most hos.

He -gracefully acknowledged the many
tokens of esteem. "iae general spoke of
the redeeming . characteristics of the

turing- Agrulnaldo. which he said was but
another striking illustration of the dar

ences to. the- .strides 'America- is making
toward commercial supremacy and the
wonderful progress made in the devglflp
ment of the resources of the South.\ His
remarks were heartily applauded.
Governor Shaw responded to the toast,
"American Patriotism and American
Valor." " The Hon. James M. Woolworth,
former president of the American Bar
Association, responded to the toast. "The
American Lawyer." Former Secretary J.

"American Motherhood and the American

"I waa taking a team up to the black
smith shop about 4 o'clock. Am I was
passing a dump of bushes on the ceme
tery road between the narrow gauge
depot and Mt. Eden a man Jumped out in
to the road and grabbed the bridle of the
horse I was riding and told me to get off
and go along with him. I tried to get
away, but he grabbed me and began
smashing me In the face with his fist, at
the same time choking me so I could
make no noise. Then he wrapped his coat
about my head. Then I heard some one
shouting: and th^Â» man ran. Pretty soon
Mr. Gall, the postman, came up and he
and another man took me home in his
wapon."
The lad's parents were terribly shocked
at the attempt to steal their child. In
answer to their appeals a band of search
ers was speedily organized to hunt the
brutal assailant down. A thorough search
of the surrounding country revealed 'no
trace of the fugitive. Meanwhile I tele
phone messages were sent to the officers
in the surrounding towns. Marshal Ram
age telephoned that he thought he had
the man at Haywards. A crowd of the
pursuers at once went oiver to Haywards
and found the object of their search In
custody. He had been arrested while
waiting for a train at the freight station.
It was proposed to string him up at
once, but the officers' counsels of modera
tion finally prevailed and the fellow was
taken to Jail.

A desperate tramp attempted to emulate
the example of Pat Crowe by kidnaping
the 12-year-old son of John Kennedy at
Mt. Eden yesterday, and narrowly escaped
lynching at the hands of a posse of angry
men .who ran him to earth. -
When - the would-be abductor was
caught, Marshal Ramage of Haywards;
where the capture was made, persuaded
the mob to let the law take its course,
and the prisoner, who had brutally beaten
his captive before alarmed by a chance
passer-by, was lodged in Jail.
The miscreant whose boldly attempted
crime was happily foiled had been seen
lurking about the saloons at Mt Eden for
several days. He was Identified readily

Cloudburst Is Thrown In for Good
Heasuxe and the Prognosticator
Says the Disturbance Is
Hot Yet Ended. :
Special Dispatch to The CaJL
SAN DIEGO. March 20.â Once more the
San Diego section of the State has been
favored beyond all others, and this time
by a double visitation of rain. That of
this forenoon was- a genuine thunder
shower, with hall accompaniment. In the
city, and bay regions and snow throughout
the mountains. The fall amounted to but
little at the northern end of the county.
Here it was .3S of an Inch and the gams
amount is reported throughout the bay
region and as far bade as the El Cajoa
and Santa Maria valleys. Grain was not
suffering, but the rain will be welcome.
A second shower fell at 7:30 this â¢vea
lng, swelling' the total of the season to
almost V& Inches. Snow fell at Campo, at
Alpine and Cuyamaca, and a similar re
port undoubtedly would have come from
Btonewail if ono could have been ob
tained. .Where the snow fell the report
was from 6 to 8 Inches, and the Indications
were for more snow In the mountains
and more rain in the valleys.
Back of Old Town there wbj quite a
cloudburst on the mesa to the north of
Mission Valley, but no damage was done,
and the cloud which carried 'the water
seemed to lift after striking the earth a
time or two. At sea opposite La Jolla
and Delmar there was a plainly denned
waterspout, which passed up the coast
about fifteen miles off shore, and when
last seen was traveling toward Ban
Clemente Island. There were no vessels
known to be in It8 track, but it seemed
large enough to have twisted a vessel at
will had it struck one.
The house of George W. Scott at Lake
view, In the upper part of El Cajon Val
ley, was struck by lightning during* the
thunder-storm of this forenoon, and.
though the building was not burned. It
waa almost entirely wrecked by the bolt.
The kitchen stove seemed the center of
the lightning's work, for it was 'literally
broken to bits, and the roof was lifted
andtorn away from the building. Though
the entire family was In the bouse at the
time, only Mrs. Scott was affected by the
streke, and she recovered almost imme
diately.
LOOMIS IS TTPHELD

It Is Believed the Venezuelan Gov

NEWYORK. March 30.â A special to
the Journal from Washington says: The
State Department, it can be said on in
formation so far received, haa approved
the attitude of Minister Loomls In the
asphalt controversy. His oourse, how
ever, has not been approved by the Vene
zuelan Government, which, it is believed,
has asked that Minister Loomls be re
called.
Venezuela acts entirely within her rights
when she asks for a recall. The*request
is conclusive, according: to the usage of
foreign offices generally. The fact of a
suggested recall, however, is nearly al
ways the forerunner of future trouble be
tween the Governments Interested; In
fact,* It Is stated by an official familiar
with the facts that if Venezuela insisted
on the departure of Minister Loomis it
will be a long time before Venezuela will
be honored. with another American Min
ister.

ADVEHTISEMENTa
THE HEALTH HABIT.
Just as Easy to Form as Any Other.
We do not deliberately f orin our pet
habits, but they are unconsciously ac-
quired and grow as we gTOw, and by the
time we learn they are hurting us we find
them too strong to be easily broken.
Then why not form a good habit, a habit
which will counteract the many bad ones?
In other words, contract the unfashion-
able habit of being always well. Â¦
The best health habit to get Into is to
have and keep a vigorous stomach; if you
ihave a healthy digestion you can drink
your beloved .coffee, smoke your> favorite
brand of tobacco, with little or no harm:
the mischief begins when these things are
forced upon the faithful stomach without
any- assistance. . . -
Form the habit of taking after meals
some harmless but efficient' digestive
which â¢will relieve the stomach of so much
extra work. .... . .
Nature furnishes us with such digestives
and when they are, combined in such a
pleasant preparation as Stuart's Dvspep-
sia Tablets they give the overworked
stomach Just the necessary assistance to
secure perfect digestion without any of
the harmful effects of cathartics and sim-
ilar drugs. . .
The habit of taking Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after meals ia as necessary to the
weak stomach as food Itself, and Indeed
to get the benefit from food eaten nothing
better and certainly nothing safer can be
used. â¢
Many families consider Stuart's Tablets
as' essential In the house as knives and
forks. .
They consist entirely of natural digest-
ive principles without the effect or char-
acteristics of drugs; they have no cathar-
tic action, but simply go to work on the
food eaten and digest it,
Take into account your bad habits and
the expense they entail and then invest
fifty cents in a box of Stuart's Dyspepsia-
Tablets and see if your digestion for the
next month la not vastly Improved,
Ask the clerk in any drug store the
name of the most successful and popular
stomach remedy and he will say Stuart's.

is due to an attack of grippe, the chief evi

the trachea; while there will be complete
restoration of her voice,, the disease Is suffi

her singing at this time: Very truly yours,

' The Loring Club concert of Tuesday
evening last served to introduce to -San
Francisco a pleasing new singer, Mrs. E.
F. Schneider, a # resident of the Garden
City. Mrs. Schneider Is a native of Copen
hagen, but received her musical education
in Berlin, with Mine. Joachim, wife of the
famous violinist, and is further indebted
to Frau Cosiraa Wagner, who took much
Interest In the clever young student. In
addition to a charming personality, Mrs.
Schneider has a mezzo-soprano voice of
gratefully pure quality, even and sweet,
and used with excellent discretion. She
has a fine gift of sympathy and her enun
ciation and phrasing are clean and artis
tic In the earlier numbers on the pro
gramme â the three songs composed by the
singer's husbandâ Mrs. Schneider was evi
dently nervous, a condition that made it
self manifest in faulty Intonation and loss
of breath control, and toight reasonably
be due to the unsympathetic accompani
ments. Miss Loring's work as accom
panist of the club choral numbers Is suf
ficiently satisfactory, but It lacks, the
"pliable quality, the quick sympathy im
perative in the work of the accompanist
to tbe solo singer. The programme also
left the Impression of Insufficient re
hearsal, particularly in the well known
"Vergebliches Staendchen," by Brahms,
in which the Instrumental setting was
frankly careless. But Mrs. Schneider's
later work was euch as to leave a most
favorable Impression and her next ap
pearance here will be awaited with much
interest. Mr. Schneider's songs, three
of which wcto sung by the composer's
wife, in common with many other mod
ern compositions, show strongly the Wag
nerian Influence, and are worthy and seri

quite decisive in form. The young San

Â£; University life in Russia has its strenuous 'moments that make football struggles appear like
a healthful and innocent amusement. Rushing the center of a Cossack guard and getting seven
years' service in the army for failure to make a touchdown is just about as exciting as anything
known to our university life, not even excepting the adoption of a new yell. - :
WHEN Senator Vest made his speech against the bill to create an American merchant ma
rine his most elegant passages, from a Missouri village standpoint, were emitted in denun
ciation of the Gloucester fishermen, because they get a tariff drawback on salt used in
curing their catch.
The Gloucester fishing industry is the principal nursery of hardy American seamanship.
The service is more dangerous and destructive to life than the navy. Congress is voting prize
money to well-paid admirals and seamen for their service in the Spanish war, and wherever they
go they are recipients of ovations for their bravery. . All this is deserved, and we find no fault with
it. But the bravery and sacrifice of the fishermen of Gloucester throws' all martial exploits into
the shade. 9 ...
Yet no- American writer has brought these brave men conspicuously into literature, and it
was left for Kipling, in his "Captains Courageous," to pay them the first immortal tribute,
in letters. u Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦
Every year at Gloucester is held a memorial service in memory of the fishermen who will
come back no more until the sea gives up its dead. It is the most pathetic ceremony held any
where in this busy world, and yet it attracts no attention beyond the borders of the primitive little
town which keeps green the memory of its heroes.
This year the list contained the names of fifty-five brave men, .who sailed away to return no
more. -But their names were read to nineteen widows, thirty-seven children who will not again see
their fathers, and a great company of fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. So Gloucester for
mally mourned- for a day, while the rest of the world went on with its pleasures, its buying and
selling, heedless of the woe wrought by the wild waters^ahd feeling but little community of feel
ing and sympathy with the hearts that ached arid the heads that bowed that day in the little fish'
ing town on the rocky coast of Massachusetts. Yet that list of the dead far outnumbered our ma
rine losses in the Spanish war, but they lostflife in the pursuits of peace and not of war, to con
tribute to the welfare of man and not to destroy him. -
In the last forty-six years Gloucester has lost 350 vessels, valued at $1,500,000, and the lives
of 1650 men. In one storm :'n 1873 31 of her'ships went down and 174 men were swallowed by
the sea.- In another storm 15 vessels foundered, carrying 120 men, who left 70 widows and 140
orphans.
The tragedy of the fisheries pf North Scotland inspired Kingsley to write that aeolian thren
ody, "The Three Fishers/' and the wraith over the unsatisfied waters of the German Ocean has ap
pealed to three French and many German writers, who have inscribed in literature the romance of
that useful occupation of risk and hazard. ;:Â¦'?'
But of all the fishing communities of the world Gloucester has seen the most tragedy, the
most tears and the sorest sorrow. Even while the comfortable Senator from Missouri stood in the
luxurious Senate making the galleries laugh by his sarcastic flings at these hardy men, they were
battling, with the tempest on the stormy banks of Newfoundland and even were plunging to their
death in the yeasty waves. Â¦ : " " -.-,..

THE GLOUCESTER FISHERMEN.
THE RUSSIAN PERIL.
" ' ' ' ' -'- Â¦' * ' iSliilll ; '' i -' ;
WHILE attacked by nihilism Russia has, to a degree, enjoyed the sympathy of the world.
The unreasoning murder of Czars and the assassinations by poison, bombs and blowing
up railway trains were abhorred by millions of men who' would instantly applaud an open
revolution against the government which these covert crimes sought to destroy.
Assassination has never weakened the Russian- autocracy. It has remained as solid, as
remorseless and as cruel as ever. Its description as a scepter that ends with a scimiter and a cross
that ends with a knout has been amply justified. Half oriental and the other half a survival of
northern savagery, it has defied dagger, bomb and poison.
Now, however, it is threatened by a new peril. The Russian students, teachers and pro
fessors are in revolt. In all the large cities they are making stormy protest against the suppres
sion of Russian manhood and womanhood. The seed planted by Tolstoi is sprouting. In vain the
holy synod excommunicates him and consigns him to torment, unblessed by the* sacraments. Thou
sands of students and teachers have assembled in protest against -the conditions they have out
grown. The savage Cossacks have' ridden them down, have cut open the faces of girls with their
whips, and have killed all sexes and ages without discrimination. The world looks on, aware that
Russian power is at war with Russian intelligence. â¢ The Muscovite empire is engaged in trying to
beat out its own brains, for when all who stand in protest are killed, Russia will have left her ex- &
serfs and her holy synod and her Cossacks, who pay their taxes by killing, and satisfy their hot
Scythian blood by overpaying when they can. â¢ ,
The students fight with sticks now, and the Cossacks with rifles, swords and thongs. : But
when thctables. turn and the people have arms, the result may be different. ' :
The struggle is one of mad desperation. It is a protest sure to end in martyrdom of .those
who make it. In all the history of the struggle of man for his heritage of freedom . no" campaign
has seemed so hopeless and the hope as forlorn as that led to-day by the cultivated brains of
Russia. The empire makes no compromise, omits no cruelty, softens no blow. While the young
life of the rest of Europe, and conspicuously that of America, is peacefully training in honor for a
high part in the future, building the fairy castles touched into form by the noble ambitions
of youth, the young life of Russia, inspired by the same ambitions, illuminated by the same lamp
of learning, swelling with the same great hopes, is being tramped out in the muddy and blood mixed
snow of the streets.
It is a pitiful and savage spectacle, but it is v not in vain. These fair-faced boys and girls,
who are ridden down by the bearded troopers from the Don, nre not the lurking and sinister assas
sins born of nihilism. They are the best and bravest blood of their race. Every student in the
schools and universities of the free lands of the world looks upon their martyrdom and makes his
quiet oath against the power that slays them. . â¢
Human thought is the force that causes power wrongly used to wither like the grass that is
cast into the oven. Thought is a magician, and some day the combined best thought of the world
will stand upon the heights and lift its hands, and Russia's autocracy will perish and fall away.
Then out of the snows will spring the seed planted by the blood of these young martyrs, and the
whip of the Cossack will fall from his hand and the jeweled crux of the holy synod will, crumble,
and man will enter into his heritage of freedom, and woman will sing the songs of liberty, and no
man shall cut her lip with a whip. . / - .'

OK the admitted failures of the
late William Shakespeare, play
wright and manager, "Cymbe
line." from the point of view of
construction, is undoubtedly the
worst. Yet nobody cares anything about
this, except an occasional actress, who
would like to present the beautiful char
acter of Imogene. but who cannot effec
tively do so on account of the crudeness
and carelessness with which are thrown
together those scenes In which she does
not appear.
For otherwise is it with Master Wil
liam's other great failureâ the character
of Julius Caesar. This is a subject of in
terest end of regret to everybody; of in
terest on account of the Intrinsic great
ness of the man; of regret on account of
Â¦what Shakespeare might have accom
plished with this character if he had not
been too lazy (?) to work it out.
The world has been waiting now exactly
Â£00 years for some dramatist to come
along and atone to Caesar for Injury done
him when, with malice prepense, he was
pitched upon the stage of the Globe Thea
ter as a mere foil to Brutus. The world
waits no longer In vain. In the fullnebs
cf time there has been given unto us
George Bernard Shaw, who claims, not
Â¦without reason, that In his "Caesar and
Clecpatra" (Stone, Chicago), he has for
the rirst time put upon the stage a reason
able, lifelike and credible representation
of the foremost man of all time.
"Shakespeare," eays Mr. Shaw, "who
knew human weakness so well, never
knew human etrength of the Caesarian
type. His Caesar is an admitted failuio;
his Lear is a masterpiece. The tragedy of
Â«^=illus!on and doubt, of the agonized
struggle *cr a foothold on the quicksand
inade by en acute observation striving to
verify its vain attribution of morality and
reipectabl^ty to nature, of the falthleÂ«s
trt'l and the keen eyes that the faithless
will is too weak to blind; all this will give
you a Hamlet cr a Macbeth, and vr'a
you ffreat applause from literary gentle
men, but it will net give you a Julius
Caesar. Caesar was not in Shakespeare,
nor in the epoch now fast waning, which
fce inaugurated. It cost Caesar no pang
to write Caesar down for the mere pur
pose cf writing Brutus up."
All of this is so admirable and 6O Ir
refutable as to make one regret that Mr.
Shaw, with a modesty unusual for him,
enould have queried that section of his
preface from which it is takenâ the sec
tion entitled "Better Than Shakespeare."
Turning now to the notes in the play,
â¢we learn how Mr. Shaw determined the
character of his hero before setting him
forth dramatically. Four negative hy
potheses had first to be considered and
rejected. Kirst. was Caesar nothing
more than the personality revealed in his
books? No, because the style is NOT the
man except in the case of authors who
are born with literary genius and who
have attained to perfect self-expression
by long practice. Caesar was not of this
class; he had no innate literary gift and
was an amateur in style. It would be
a mistake, therefore, to represent him as
his books show him, "A man of great
common sense and good taste," as the
average Bnglishman would sayâ which
being Interpreted into Shawese. reads
â¢'without originality or moral courage."
Secondâ Was Caesar a man of small mil
itary capacity, great, like Cromwell, only
by comparison, because he was never op
posed by any really capable general?
Very likely, and If Caesar's alleged great
ness rested only on his military exploits,
it would be but a little greatness. "But
Cueear's victories were only advertise
ments for an eminence that would never
have become popular without them."
Caesar, unlike Nelson (and. it might have
been added, Wellington) was greater off
the battlefield than on it.
Thirdâ Was Caesar, perhaps, nothing
b'Jt a Nelson and a Gladstone combinedâ
â¢'a prodigality of vitality without any.
epecial quality of mind â nay, with Ideas
that were worn out before he was born,
as Nelson's and Gladstone's were." All
the stories cited of Caesar's private life
eeem to negative this assumption and to
show that it is safe to predicate of Caesar
true originality.
Fourthâ Is it correct to Ceny to Caesar
a sense of hutaor? There Is no more rea
eon to suppose he was lacking in this
than to suppose he was deaf or blind.
Â¦His famous "What, you, too, Brutus?"
prove him (Shawlstlcally) to have been
an Incorrigible comedian, and his so
called ambition was rather a light-hearted
desire for explorationâ Columbus, not
Honry V.
Positively. -then, Caesar was original â
that is, great. And in what does great
ness consist? Here is the answer: "Hav
ing virtue, he has no need of goodness. He
is neither forgiving, frank nor generous,
because a man who is too great to resent
has nothing to forgive; a man who says
things that other people are afraid to say
need be no more feared than Bismarck
was; and there is no generosity in giving
things you do not want to people of whom
you intend to make use."
Here, then,. you have the Shaw Caesar,
and a very good Caesar, too. Cleopatra
Is entertainingly represented as a little
vixen of 18. antj. the play Is crowded with
other highly colored figuresâ Belzanor, the
captain of Cleopatra's guard; Ftatateeta
(whose name Caesar can never pro
nounce), the Queen's nurse, a murderess;
Theodotus, the pedant, who values a li
brary more than a man; Pothinus, a poli
tician; Apollodorus, the Sicilian shopkeep
er and Patrician patron of fine art; Ruflo.
Caesar's favorite lieutenant; Britannus,
Caesar's secretary, a delicious satire on
the English philistlne of to-Aay, whose
traits are in him foreshadowed. â¢ â¢ â¢
If a play of brilliancy equal to this were
TiTitten to-day by a Frenchman or a Ger
man the theaters of Paris or Berlin would
be competing for a chance to produce it.
But London seems satisfied with foolish
melodramas about Nell Gwyn and the
broken pieces thrown out from Sardou's
carpenter shop.
A 6lngle extract, from the climax of the
third act, must serve to give an idea of
the amusing incidents with which the play
is filled. Caesar and his friends are be
sieged in the lighthouse of Alexandria by
the Egyptians; their only chance for
safety is to reach their fleet in the har
bor.
Caesar (gravely)â Cleopatra, when that
trumpet sounds we must take every man
bis life in his hand and throw it in the
face of death. And of my soldiers who
have trusted me there is not one whoso
hand I shall not hold more sacred than
your head. (Cleopatra is overwhelmed.
Her eyes fill with tears.) -Apollodorus,
you must take her back to the palace.
Apollodorusâ Am I a dolphin, Caesar, to
cross the seas with young ladies on my
back? aiy boat Is sunk; all yours arc
either at the barricade or have returned
to the .city. I will hail one if I can; that
is all I can do. (He goes back to the cause
way.)
Cleopatra (struggling with her tears)â It
does not matter. I will not go back. No
body cares- for me.
Caesar â Cleopatra
Cleopatraâ Tou want roe to be killed.
Caesar (still . more gravely)â My poor
child; your life matters little here to any
one bet yourself. (She gives way alto
gether at this, casting herself down on the
i&ggota weeping. Suddenly a great tumult
Is heard In the distance, buclnas and
trumpets sounding through a storm of
shouting. Britannua rushes to the para
pet and looks along the mole. Caesar and
Rufio turn to one another with Quick In
telligence.)
Caesarâ Come, Ruflo.
Cleopatra (scrambling to her knees and
clinging: to him)â No. no. Do not leave
me, Caesar. (He snatches his skirt from
her clutch.) Oh!
Britannus (from the parapet)â Caesar,
we are cut off. The Egyptians have land
ed from the west harbor between us and
the barricade!
Rufio (running- to see)â Curses! It la
true. We are caught like rats In a trap.
Caesar (ruthfully)â Ruflo! Rufio! My
men at the barricade are between the sea
party and the shore party! I have mur
dered them.
Rufio (coming back from the parapet to
Caesar's right hand)â Ah, that comes of
fooling with this girl here,
Apollodorus (coming up quickly from the
causeway)â Look over the parapet, Cae
sar.
Caesarâ We have looked, my friend. We
must defend ourselves here.
Apollodorusâ I have thrown the ladder
Into the sea.' They cannot get in without
it.
Rufioâ Ay; and we cannot get out. Have
you thought of that?
Apollodorusâ Not get out? Why not?
You have ships in the east harbor.
Britannus (hopefully at the parapet)â
The Rhodian galleys are standing In
toward us already. (Caesar quickly joins
Britannus at the parapet.)
Rufio (to Apollodorus impatiently)â And
by what road are wa to walk to the

Apollodorusâ I will show you. (Calling

Britannusâ Fifty fathom.
Caesarâ No, no; they arp farther oft
than they seem in this clear air to your

Apollodorus â Good. Defend yourselves

Rufio â Have you wings, perhaps?
Apollodorus â 'Water w.ngs. soldier. Be

foremost into the sea.
Caesar (like a schoolboy, wildly excited)
âBravo! bravo! (Throwing off his cloak.)
By Jupiter! I will do that. too.
Ruflo (seizing him)â You are mad. Tea
shall not.' â¢
Caesarâ Why not? Can I not swim as
well as he? â¢
Rufio (frantic)â Can an old fool dive and
swim like a young one? He is twenty- five

Caesar â¢ (breaking loose from Ruflo)â

Caesarâ I will race you to the galley for

Cleopatraâ But me! me!! me!!! What

Caesarâ I will carry you on my back to
the galley like a dolphin.
Rufloâ When you see me rise to the sur

And then in with you after her, both of
you.
Cleopatraâ No, no, NO. I shall be
drowned.
Britannus â Caesar, I am a man and a
Briton, not a fish. I must have a boat. I
cannot swim.
Cleopatraâ Neither can I.

IT IS THE WAY YOU USE IT.
It's the Method Employed Which
Hakes Success or Failure.
One man with pen. Ink and paper can
produce a landscape, another man with
same pen and Ink may not be able to
write his own name legibly. It is all la
knowing how.
It is equally true In the use of medi-
cines. The same remedies we have to-day
have existed for thousands of years, but it
their existence was known the knowledge;
of how to use them was lacking.
They became valuable to tho hunum
race only when experiment and sdenco
showed the way to use them to get re-
sults. <
The grip Is an old disease with a new
name; it Is really catarrhal In character
and the usual symptoms are those oÂ£
acute catarrh, but the old-time catarrhi
powders, salves and sprays do 'not cure Iti
neither does the application of antiseptics
through an inhaler give * anything more
than relief for a short time.
The antiseptics are all right; they wiH
kill the germs of catarrh and grip if they
are. appUed rightly, but their local appli-
cation to the nosa and throat avail lUtla
because the. germs are In tho blood and
through the" whole system.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain many*"
of these same antiseptics, that are usett
In sprays and Inhalers, but Instead of ap-
plying them to the inflamed membranea
of the nose and throat, they are takea
into the stomach and thus reach the blood,
the real seat of the disease, and drive out
the Infectious germs through the natural
channels of the bowels and kidneys.
In other words Stuart's Catarrh Tablets'
reach the cause of the mischief Instead ejg
merely local symptoms.
The remarkable success of these tablets
In curing grip, catarrh and threat and
lung troubles Is because they drive the ca-
tarrhal poison from the system and tho
nose and throat become clear of tha ex-
cessive secretion of mucus, which causes
the hawking, spitting and gagging, be-
cause the secretion la not supplied from
healthy blood.
Two years ago Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
were unknown, but to-day have bÂ«come so
popular through positive merit that drug-
gists everywhere in the . United States,
Canada and Great Britain now sell them.

An application was made by Attorney
Gallagher before Judge Mogan yesterday
for a subpena to compel the attendance
of J. J. Gottlob of the Columbia Theater
as a witness when the case of Mary Mc-
Cann, alias Mary Thome, charged with

Fears Botsford Hay Abscond.
A bench warrant was Issued by Judge
Fritz yesterday for the arrest of Prank
Botsford, who is charged by A. M. Shields
of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
with felony embezzlement. On the repre
sentation of Shields, who was influenced
by tho defendant's wife's pleadings, the
Judge allowed Botsford his liberty on J20
cash ball till he rendered his decision as
to whether he should be held to answer.
Shields notified the Judge yesterday that
Botoford was making arrangements to
leave the city and asked that the bench
warrant be Issued.
Dan Dougherty, who faces the audience
frctn behind footlights at the Central The
ater, wels arrested yesterday for assault
with a Weadly weapon, to- wit: a cane. It
was used with considerable force upon
the cranium of Ferdinand Cooper, another
Thesjjian.
The assault is alleged to have taken
place sX Market and Powell streets, and
prew cut of Dougherty's lack of memory.
Cooper's ekull is said to have been frac
tured &x*d he is In a serious condition.
According to the 6tory told by Mrs.
Cooper, who applied for the warrant yes
terday roc ruing, a till collector persisted
In dunning her husband for a bill that the
latter claims he paid. He refreshed his
memory and recalled that his friend, Dan
Dougherty, was present when the coin
was pt-ssed over to his creditor. Meeting
Doug-herty Thursday he asked him to
make a statement that thÂ»> collector was
unjust in his demands, but Dougherty's
mind was a blank on the subject.
"If vou forget your lines like you for
pet what a friend wants you to remember
you would spend all of your salary In
fines," retorted Cooper, and he wound up
by calling the man whose memory had
slipped e. cog a liar, with embellishments.
This was Doug'herty's cue, although ho
forgot to act his part that day. He waited
until the morrow, and when he met
Cooper on Market street walked up to
him and struck him several times on the
head with a heavy cajie, felling him to
the street. Then the assailant made a
hasty exit and Cooper went to a drug
store, from where he was taken to his
home. The curtain will rise on the last
act in the Police Court Monday mornlnc.

CLEANS HER TEETH
WITH HOUGH ON" BATS
Mrs. Joseph McElroy Uses Poison
While Temporarily Insane and
Dies Soon After.
Mrs. Joseph McElroy, , an aged woman
residing at 230 Francisco .street, cleaned
her teeth with rough on â¢ rats yesterday
afternoon and died in excruciating agony
a short time afterward. The woman had
been sick for some time, and was tem
porarily Insane when she used the poison.
It is not believed that she Intended to
end her life.
Two months ago Mrs. McElroy was sent
to Mount Zlon Hospital. She Improved
under treatment, and a few days ago her
condition was such that she was sent to
her home in charge of a nurse.
Yesterday morning Mrs. McElroy be
came delirious, and in the afternoon arose
and started to clean her teeth with a sub
stance that was contained in a small box.
The nurse had stepped from the room to
secure some medicine when her patient
took the stuff, and as soon as she re
turned she investigated and found that
tho box had been filled with rough on
rats.
Mrs. McElroy died about two hours af
terward, and her body was sent to the
Morgue.
The most Interesting sign of the times
locally connected with the development of
the California oil Industry Is the,exten
sion of the market' for the. output of the
wells which this city is affording. Fire
Marshal Towe stated yesterday that from
two to three applications are made every
week for permission to use oil fuel aa a
substitute for coal fuel. The applicants
all represent large concerns. This must
necessarily be so, for the reason that con
siderable expense is Involved in making
the change from coal to oil burning ap
paratus, and unless the volume of fuel to
be consumed is large It would not pay to
change. Fire Marshal Towe is busy con
sidering various matters connected with
the permits for location of storage tanks.
There are about eighty large concerns in
San Francisco now burning oil fuel, i ThÂ«
number will be very largely increased by
the end of tha year. . .
In addition to the large 30,000-barrel
storage tank of the Market Street Rail
way Company, the compaify will .have six
other tanks in the city, for which nego
tiations are now going on. These will ba
smaller than the original tank.
It is reported that the Mount Diablo Oil
Company has struck oil sand which prom
ises well at a depth of 600 feet. This was
the first well to be drilled in Contra Costa
County.
Attention has been called to the fact
that the drilling of wells for oil has de
termined that there are vast quantities
of water to be reached, which may be
come valuable in the arid districts. Two
marked instances illustrative of the "ap
preciation in which this fact Is held have
just come to light. The San Jacinto Qll
Company employed an expert, who re
ported that he did not consider the pros
pects favorable for oil, but pointed out
a locality where he believed a large flow
of artesian water would be encountered.
The stockholders console themselves with
the thought that water is almost as valu
able as oil in the San Jacinto territory,
end also that the location selected ia
most favorable for the distribution of
water. . The second Instance is in the
Sunset district.
The Bakersfleld Callfornian says con
cerning that water find: "The most re
markable strike ever made In Sunset was
that made recently by the Raisin City on
the northwest quarter of 31, 32-24. The
find was water, pure in quality and ap
parently abunaant In quantity, as steady
baling for a half-day failed to lower the
level perceptibly. This is the only vein
Of water fit for drinking, as well as for
steaming and drilling, ever found in the
district, and the operators In that section
are jubilant. The Raisin City officials are
particularly gratified, as it sells at the
rate of 75 cent3 a barrel. T|ie company
will make a water well out of the hole,
and will sink another for the same pur
pose as soon as possible."
A tract of 2503 acres between Rag Gulch
and White River, In Kern County, has
been bonded by a company which will
drill there. This la in new territory.
The people of Del Norte County now
think -they have oil territory. The Del
Norte Record says:
A company has been formed to borÂ» and
prospect for oil near Arcata. 80 far thÂ» only
indications are that at time* a seepage has
been observed by different persons. In tho
western part of this county oil- seepage- In
large quantities can be observed any time It
Is looked for. This Is especially true around
Lake Earl, where the writer has observed
Braall ponds entirely covered with oil, and also
in the vicinity of Point St. George. The fact
that the oil seepage Is more noticeable around
the lake may be due to the fact of Its low
position and the' loose condition of the soil
through the Band hills. However, It is there.
Another supposition that strikes us as being
reasonable Is that this region lies In line with
the oil belt that has been discovered south of.
us extending- In a northerly direction, com
mencing at the southern end of the San Joa
quin Valley and extending as far north as
Humboldt County. Whether or not the belt
continues 100 mlUa farther north Into XM
Norte is yet to be ascertained, but there are
many conditions that seem to point to the
fact that it does.
Work is progressing quietly for the es
tablishment of a new refinery In Los An
geles for the manufacture of asphaltum
from crude petroleum. Southern Califor
nia has an equipment capable of refining
100,000 barrels of oil per month, "it is be
lieved," says the Los Angeles Herald,
"that these will, within & few months, be
all running at their full capacity, taking
up the equivalent of the entire Los An
geles field."
A correspondent of the Los Angeles
Times reports that surface Indications of
oil have been discovered near the town
of Daggett, on the Santa Fe, in the desert.

KING OIL BOWLS
OVER KING COAL
.Through the blundering methods of Cap
tain of Detectives Seymour, Clara Mc-
Cann, who is wanted for attempting to
blackmail Christian Smith/ Is still at
large. Last Thursday the woman was ar
rested for vagrancy, but was released on
$50 cash bail furnished by Attorney Wal
ter Gallagher. Shortly after she was re
leased from custody the head of the de
tective department happened to think that
she was wanted on the more serious
charge of blackmailing Mr. Smith and he
lost no time in detailing two of his men
to find her. '
â¢A'hey were Instructed to closely watch
her home and arrest her as soon as sho
appeared. In some way, presumably due
to the volubility of Seymour when tell
ing his troubles outside of. the Hall of
Justice, the woman learned that she wot)
wanted on. another charge and she kept
out of sight. Her attorney says that she
is still iu the city and declares that he
will have her in the Police- Court when
her case is called to-morrow.
According to a friend of the woman, she
was a passenger on the same car with
Seymour Friday night. .Notwithstanding
that he had seen her a number of times
he failed to recognize her. The woman,
at first, concluded to speak to him, but as
he seemed anxious to avoid her, according
to her friend*s statement, sho walked to
the other end of the car.
It Is reliably said that Miss McCann Is
daily seen in the vicinity of police head
quarters. . Since her release on bonds she
has frequently visited her attorney's of
fice, which Is only a ehqrt distance from
the Hall of Justice, and consulted him
about giving herself up, so as to not fur
ther worry the head of the detective de
partment. Learning that the woman will
appear when her case is called to-mor
row, Seymour, anxious to get even with
her for not throwing herself into tno
arms of his blundering sleuths and thus
save his reputation as a rank Imitator o"
Sherlock Holmes, has detailed two of
his men to stand at the entrance to the
Hall of Justice in the morning and place
her under arrest as soon as she appears.

' LOS ANGET..ES. March 30.â An Insane
man, whose mania Is of a religious char

several days a wild-eyed, long-haired man
haB patrolled the streets in that neighbor
hood, waving his arms aloft and accost
ing those whom he met with strange cries
and questions. Last night a young woman
who left a San Pedro street car at Sev

rushed up to her, shouting out biblical ad
monitions. The girl took one glance at
the demented man and then quickened
her steps. He followed, shrieking: "Re

whosoever belie veth In himâ remember,
oh, remember!" Then the woman ran at
the top of her speed. *~
The fellow has made a habit of prowling
through the streets In the neighborhood
at night, shouting at the top of his voice
and singing religious hymns: He is a
husky youth with auburn hair and wears

vicinity dread to stir from their homes
after nightfall for fear of encountering
him. He has on several occasions grabbed

Sceclal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS, ANGELES, March 30.â Pretty,
brewn-eyed Vivienne Gedge, the 13-year
old daughter of Dr. Donald McCulloch
Gedge of 406 Sutter street, San Francisco,
to-night told The Call representative her
own story of her experience with an ab
ductor in Los Angeles on Thursday morn
ing. She virtually corroborates the facts
as heretofore published. Dr. Gedge, the
girl's father, says he is satisfied the man
is a degenerate and that his motives were
of the basest. He believes that only the
exceptional coolness and courage of his
little daughter saved her. That Dr. Gedge
did not Immediately report the matter to
the police was due to the .fact that it
could only further excite and embarrass
his child, with but small chances of cap
tuilng her abductor. The little girl re
lates her perillous experience graphically:
"I had spent the night previous at Sen
ator White's house," she said, "and was
waiting at Tenth and Main streets for a
car. It was 8:30 o'clock and I was on my
Mvay to school. . Mamma and I are spend
ing the winter here with my aunt. Mrs.
George McReynolds, 490 Solano avenue,
while our new home is being built at San
Francisco, and I am going to school. Papa
happened to be visiting us. While I was
waiting for my car a man came driving
down Main street in a buggy. When op
posite me he stopped, got out of the buggy
ami started toward me. He had a shawl
In his hand. He had a gray beard and
mustache and gray hair. He was dressed
slouchy and Â¦ was not clean. He wore a
black slpucli hat. He came up behind me.
He wrapped the shawl about my orms and
whispered, 'If you scream I'll kill you.'.
"Then he lifted .me -into' the bugsry and
tied a handkerchief .about my. mouth and
one around my arms, which were tied be
hind me. He hit the horse with a whip
and we started down Tenth street. He
kept I whipping the horse until 1 1 thought
if would run away. I cried to myself, but
was afraid to cry out for fear he would
kill me. '
"When we were about a mile below the
end of the car line he stopped near a
clump of pepper trees and got out t)f the
buggy. He disappeared up a side street,
and as soon as he was out of sight I
jumped from the. buggy and ran. About
a block down the road I met a boy on a
bicycle and, seeing my aims tied and mv
mouth bandaged, , he freed me. Then'^l
ran to the car line and came home."
An examination showed the child's arms
to be bruised and swollen where they had
been bound. No trace of the abductor has
been found. â¢ v::-

SAN DIEGO, March 30.â Miss Minnie
Taylo, who for the past five years was
a member of the family. of Reuben Quad
ermass. a Kansas capitalist, -who resides
at Fourteenth and D streets in this city,
met death in a tragic manner this morn
ing. She was a member of a Jolly tally Â«ho
party driving to Lakeside for a day's out-
Ing. When near Lamasa the horses be
came slightly frightened in going down
a hill and Miss Taylo, evidently fearing
that there would be a runaway, jumped
out of the vehicle and struck on her head.
Her skull was fractured, producing con
cussion of the brain. Death was instan
taneous, according to Dr. J. C. Hearne,
who conducted the postmortem examina
tion.
The other members of the party were
Reuben Harrison, Charles Davidson,
Richard Lamar, Miss Elsie Davidson and
Miss Mabel Miller.
The accident occurred at 10:30 o'clock
in the morning, while the party was on
the outward trip. The vehicle was not
provided with a brake, making It neces
sary to use some caution in going down
hills. The strain was so great on the
harness while the descent of a hill near
Lookout ranch was being made that one
of- the holdback straps, broke, causing the
carriage to run forward against the
horses, frightening them.' As soon as
Richard Lamar, who was driving, saw
that the strap hail broken he quickly
handed the lines to Miss Miller, and. with
Reuben Harrison, jumped out to j try to
hold back the vehicle as much as pos
sible, so as to prevent it running against
the horses. They were not very success
ful, but the rig reached the bottom of
the. hill without mishap. '
It was then that Miss Taylo made her
fatal leap. While the horses were still
running at a rapid pace she arose from
her seat without a word and jumped in
an opposite direction from that in which
the rig was going. It was virtually a
dive to the ground and Miss Taylo struck
on the right side of her 'head. Members
of the party ran to where she lay and
endeavored to resuscitate her, not know
ing that life had flel. rihe did not move
a muscle, but believing mat she was only
unconscious Dr. Matthewson of Boston
and. Dr. Hammond of Spring Valley were
sent for. She was beyond their aid when
they arrived.
A postmortem examination was made
by Dr. Hearne. He found a long fracture
of the skull on the right side, extending
from, the right ear to the base of the
skull. The crack was a quarter of an Inch
wide. - . . â¢. .... ..
Miss Taylo . was 22 years of age. Her
body will be shipped to Howard, Kans. ,
for interment, her. parents, Mr. and Mrs.
John Taylo, being residents of that place.

SUISUN, March. 80.â J. A. Woodman,
who instantly killed his wife and
wounded her. companion, - Ira M. Jones , at
DaviB ville last night, was brought to the
County Jail at i Falrfleld this morning.
Woodman wu very nervous and made a
statement to thÂ« officers regarding the
tragedy. He said - that for some time, he
had -suspected Improper relations between
his wife and Jones. On Friday evening
he went to the home of his mother-in
law, Mrs. Briggs, and asked for his wife.
Finding she was not there, he concluded
that she had gone out with Johes. Wood
man went back to his residence and, se
curing a shotgun, went In search of the
couple. At a point about 200 yards south
of the railroad bridge near Davisville he
found his wife and Jones sitting on the
sidetrack.
At his approach Mrs. "Woodman Bald:
"Don't run tfway, Jones. Woodman will
do no harm. His threats amount to noth
ing." ' Woodman said he then opened fire
with the Intention of killing Jones. He
did not desire to kill his wife. He had
previously warned , Jones to desist from
paying attention to Mrs. Woodman.
Jones In his statement said when he saw
Woodman level his shotgun he immedi
ately placed Mrs. Woodman In front of
him, thinking the Infuriated husband
would not shoot. Mrs. Woodman was
shot through the heart and fell back into
his arms. He made a Tush for Woodman
and was shot in the shoulder. Then he
turned to escape and was shot In the back.

Oareer'of Mrs. Woodman.
Mrs. Georgie Woodman was the daugh
ter of the pioneer fruit grower, G. G.
Brlggs. Her life was full of vicissitudes.
Well educated, highly accomplished,
btessed with youth, beauty and wealth,
it opened auspiciously and full of prom
ise. Her first marriage was to G B.
Reid. The union proved to be an un
happy one. After three children were
born to them they were divorced. Mrs.
Reid afterward married George Maxwell,
but their married life was of short dura
tion and they were soon divorced.
While the Maxwells lived on the vine
yard south of Woodland, and which was
at one time Mrs. Maxwell's property,
they had in their employ a man named
John Woodman. After Mrs. Maxwell's
divorce from her husband, and about four
years ago, she was married to Woodman,
and they went to live In Davisville. L.ater
they lived on the Briggs vineyard, on the
Solano side of Putah Creek, near Davis
ville, with Mrs. Woodman's mother.
For a long time both Woodman and his
wife have been dissipating a great deal.
"Woodman was Jealous of his wife. Most
of the time they have lived in hard straits
and their married life was anything but
happy,
TW or three years ago Ira Jones lo
cated in Davisville. He was unmarried
and about 30 years of age. Lately he
has been paying a good deal of attention
to Mrs. Woodman, and it is said that
they met frequently and clandestinely.
Woodman warned Jones to keep away
from his wife and threatened to kill him.
Jones treated the threat lightly, but the
people of Davisville were- not surprised
when they heard of the tragedy..
Weepp Over His Dead Wife.
After the shooting last evening when
"Woodman discovered that "he -had killed
his wife he knelt beside her. held her head
in his arms and covered her face with
kisses. He wept bitterly and protested
that he did no: intend to kill her, but that
he only wanted the life of the man who
came between him and the woman he
loved.\
Two men, evidently tramps, were in ear
shot of the tragedy when it occurred. One

Sgecial Dispatch to The CalL
SAN LUCAS, March 3O.-That the ex
citement created, through the striking of
an oil .vein in the Tom Boy well, located
on the Georee J>udley farm, two miles
west of San Ardo, has spread. throughout
this entire section goes without saying.
To use a common . expression, the people
are simply "oil crazy." And they have
cause to be elated, for all Southern Monte
rey County is already feeling the effects
of the boom. Representatives of bigr oil
companies. Including the Standard, have
opened offices in San Ardo and are buying
up every available inch of oil land. Resi
dents who for years have not jingled any
thing larger than silver pieces in their
pockets are now. exhibiting handfuls of
double eagles, the proceeds of leases and
options that they have disposed of to capi
talists who have rushed in to get a por
tion of the land. What adds confidence
to the experts Is the fact that the Tom
Boy is practically the first company whose
drill has penetrated to a depth of more
than x*~m feet. It is argued that If the
pioneer has achieved such quick success,
there must be an inexhaustible supply or
oil underlying this region, which needs
only the touch of the drill to bring- It to
the surface.
The Call correspondent yesterday vis
ited the oil fields around San Ardo. The
first place stopped at was the oil well of
the San Ardo Consolidated Oil Company
on the Brandensteln place, three mile*
from San Ardo. The drillers were remov
ing the casing from this well to drill far
ther up the slone. They had penetrated
to a depth of 1300 feet. There Is some
thing- mysterious in this move of the com
pany, as it Is known it had splendid oil
indications and work on the well was pro
ceeding satisfactorily; indeed, the belief 1b
prevalent at San Ardo that the company
has struck oil and is keeping its pood for
tune quiet while it proceeds to develop a
new location. The well was started last
July. ' y '
'The Tom Boy well, of course. Is the cen
ter of attraction. This well la now 12S0
feet deep, going through what the expert
believes to be the last layer of sand. Al
ready the oil exudes through this layer
when pumped. The plain fact Is that the
Tom- Boy Company has oil, but no gusher.
Mr. Canfield, the expert on the ground,
believes the Tom Boy will prove to be a
rie~ Well.
Besides the Tom Boy, work on the San
Antonio and Normal wells Is being push
ed night and day. The secrecy that sur
rounds these wells, while mystifying, is
satisfactory evidence to the people of San
Ardo that the prospects are bright.
Below San Ardo, at Bradley, the rall
roau yards are covered with derricks and
casing pipes and all the paraphernalia
connected with oil wells. Between San
Lucas and San Miguel there are at pres
ent ten wells being drilled.

DOING GOOD EVERYWHERE.
A Medical Discovery That Effectually
Cures Piles in Every Form.
For many years physicians have experi-
mented In vain, seeking a remedy which
would effectually enre piles and other rec-
tal troubles without resorting to a surgi-
cal operation. Many remedies were found
to elve temporary relief, but none could
be depended upon to make a lasting, sat-
isfactory cure.
Within a recent period, however, a new
remedy, tha Pyramid Pile Cure, has been
repeatedly tested ln hundreds of cases
and with highly satisfactory results.
The first effect of the Pyramid Pile CurÂ«
Is to Instantly remove the pain and Irrita-
tion generally present, and from that time
on the cure rapidly progresses, and before
the patient is hardly aware of it he is en-
tirely cured. The remedy seems to act 'di-
rectly on the nerves and blood vessels of
the parts affected, as It comes Into direct
contact with them and sets up a healthy
action, which In a perfectly natural way
1 brings the parts to their normal condition.
The remedy does Us work without any
pain or Inconvenience to the sufferer, and
Is Justly considered one of the most meri-
torious discoveries of modern medicine.
Piles Is one of the most annoying and
oftentimes dangerous diseases with
which humanity Is afflicted. If neglected
It frequently develops lnto-Flstuhi or some
equally fatal and incurable trouble,
whereas by ths timely use 'of this simple
but effective remedy no one need suffer a
single day from any form of piles, unless
he wants to.
The Pyramid Plla CurÂ« Is perfectly
harmless, containing no mineral poisons,
and Is also very reasonable ln price, cost-
Ing; but CO cents a package. It is sold in
drugstores everywhere. . The manufactur-
ers of the remedy are the Pyramid Drug
Co. of Marshall, Mich., who have placed
this excellent preparation before the pub-
lic only after giving it thorough and re-
peated testa ln the hands of reputable
physicians. The results ln hundreds of
cases have convinced us that It will not
disappoint you.

amlnatlon disclosed the fact that his right
leg had been broken above the knee.
While the crowd was cheering at the
success of the launching Scott was direct
ing the final preparations to check the
headway of the vessel. For this purpose
a "snubbing rope" was used. While the
slack was being paid out one of the colls
caught around his leg and threw him to
the ground. The rope unwound almost as
soon as he fell and to this Is attributed
his escape from a plunge Into the bay.
There were a number of eye-witnesses
to the affair who declare that the accident
was unavoidable. All claim that the twist
in the rope which had been carefully
colled and caught Scott's leg In its em
brace twisted suddenly and ensnared him
before he could, possibly get out of tha
way.. . .
Mr. Scott was as soon as possible re
moved in an ambulance to St. Luke's
Hospital. He is the nephew of Henry T.
and Irving M. Scott and is the general
superintendent of tho Union Iron Works.

Asks for a Writ of Error.
John E. Sexton, convicted, in Placer
County of an attempt to extort money by
threatening to expose a cigar dealer for
using unstamped, cigar boxes containing
cigars, appealed to the Supreme Court and
judgment 'was affirmed some weeks ago.
Yesterday Sexton applied to the appellate
court for a writ of error. It appears that
at the time the Supreme Court upheld the
decision of the lower court it stated that
Sexton should have been prosecuted for
misdemeanor, but the court did not have
the power to. set aside the judgment-. The
petition for a writ of- error is on the
ground that the offense, if any, was com
mitted in violation of the Federal laws
relative to the Internal Revenue Depart-'
ment and should . have been acted upon
solely by the authorized Federal officials.'

San Francisco Lodge Gives
Its Annual Banquet at
Ban Francisco Lodge' No: .'3, Benevolent
and Protective Order, of; Elks, .gave its
annual dinner in the Maple . Hall of the
Palace Hotel last night. Nearly two hun
dred of "the best people on earth" occu-.
pied seats at the very tastefully decorated
tables to enjoy an excellent menu. The
guest of honor was. Grand Exalted Ruler
J. B. Fisher, and at'either side of him at
tlie head of the table sat H. S.- Manning,
past exalted ruler of San Francisco Lodge,
acting as toastmaster; the district depu
'tles from the north and from the south,
and. the officers of the local lodge who
were elected last Friday night and those,
who served during the term Just expired.
It was a gathering of representative men
from all walks of life, and it was a jolly
one. The menu card was in the form "of
an immense elk tooth, surmounted by 'a
clock with the hands pointing to the hour
of 11, the time when all Elks rise and in
silence drink to the memory of those who
have gone before. The menu having been
discussed, Toastmaster Manning called
upon the guest of honor to respond .to
"The Grand Exalted Ruler." His response
Â¦was a masterly effort, full of the broth
erly love for which the order is specially
noted. Other toasts were:
"The Exalted Ruler Elect," by Thomas E.
Dunne; "San Francisco Lodge," Past Exalted
Ruler T. F. Bonnet; ""The Good of the Order,"
J. J. Barret; "Eleven O'clock Toast." Frank
J. Klerce; "The Northern Jurisdiction,"
Deputy Frank Gray; "The Southern Jurisdic
tion," Deputy TV. F. Kennedy; '"The Army."
Colonel J. R. Howell; "The Navy," Colonel
Ed Beck; "Oakland Lodge," Judge Melvln.
Between toasts vocal selections were
rendered by the Elks' quartetâ O'Brien,
Ogllvie, Lloyd and Kay. Mr. "Lloyd
also rendered "The Holy City" as a solo.
Signor Castellano gave a tenor solo, Mr.
O'Brien sang "The Palms," Mr. Ogllvie
sang "Romany Lass" and Signor Pardlni
gave selections from operas. As-the gath
ering arose to say good-by all clasped
hands and sang "Should Auld Acquaint
ance Be Forgot?" â¢ Â¦ .
The Grand : Exalted Ruler, with his
wife; District Deputy Gray ' and wife,

Clerk. Williams , of the Justices' Court
will call the attention of the "Grand Jury
to the fact that the National Law and
Collection Agency Company has Issued
fraudulent summonses, purporting to have
been "Issued by the' Justices' Court. , The
summonses were issued by the collection
concern -.without the' formality 'of I filing
suit, and the offense is held by Williams
to be forgery^nnd punishable by Imprison
ment. On the face of the summonses the
name"* of . E.., W. .Williams, .the Justice's
clerk, has been forged. . The attorney for
the company, is; J. N: , Ross, who. has of
fices in the Montgomery block, at the cor-'
ner of Washington, and Montgomery
streets. â¢Â¦ â¢ ' i â¢
The attention of Williams was called
to the "fraudulent practice' when; an an
swer to- a complaint was filed yesterday
by Zena'sU. Dodge as attorney for Mrs.
S. Moffatt. The answer was numbered
22.6S4, and in it Dodge specifically denied
all the allegations in the complaint. Upon
investigation Williams learned that no
complaint had ever been filed, and he
recollected a similar occurrence in* a com
plaint purported to have been filed by A.
CBauy. Yesterday Attorney .Ross ap
peared at the Justices' clerk's. office, and
he was sharply called to account by Wil
liams, who said -that the frauds must
cease forthwith. Williams later wrote an
official communication to- the collection
company, In which he expressed his in
tention to bring the matter before the
Grand Jury at its next session. . .
The. fraudulent, summons was signed by
E. W. Williams, by George W. RIley, dep
uty clerk. Williams says there Is no such
person as Rlley employed In his office, and
charges thaf his signature is clearly a
forgery. . Ross denies that he signed the
names, and claims that it was done by
some one In his office. Williams says that
the concern has been illegally, using the
Justices' Court as a means of collecting
bills. By falling to file suit in the regular
way the concern saved the fees that are
usually colif"-tf*d.'-^ : .

ISM4R THE GYPSY
Discovery of Oil Lands Made as a
Result o? ' the Celebrated
Egyptian's Marvelous
Powers.
If Ismar, the wonderful. Egyptian clair-
voyant 'and palmist, who for months has
drawn crowds :to her Oriental office. . 1148
Market street, two doors below Weinstock
& Lubin's, was at liberty, to use the names
of some of the people to whom she has
given sittings, together with their testi-
monials as to some of the wonderful work
-he 'has done for them, there would be
absolutely no room for any doubt as to
her ability- to Â¦ forecast the future. Ismar
numbers among her patrons some of the
most prominent people of the "city, and. the
things she has correcUy predicted . con-
cerning the future of some of them would,
if properly connected, | form ;an , Intensely
Interesting 'story- . Several months ago a
prominent business man, who does not re-
side / far away 'and who" ls ' well ' known
here, called to conBult . Ismar. , Among
other things the celebrated Egyptian told
him that within two months fell In endless
quantities would be /discovered on * a- cer-
tain tract of land ..he ; owned. The .man
laughed Â¦ at 'the prediction. s However, Â¦ Is-
mar ; having - fully . described . the . tract '.of
land In question, he decided to visit it. He
soon ; became - that what i Ismar
had 1 told i him regarding the ', existence of
oil- was absolutely true, and as a result of
his efforts several very _. large veins were
located. -When Interviewed regarding thÂ«

years' use of the' glasses you fitted to my sight
I would tejl you what I thought of them, I take
pleasure in writing, I. have .never had so much
comfort in the use of glasses as I had with
those procured from you. Their. use has dem-
onstrated that they restored normal sight, and
I add further that the dally use of them for
many hours by day and by night has not pro-'
duced any strain on the eyes, such as I expe-
rienced with other glasses. .Respectfully,.-..--

Editor San Francisco Call: Kindly allow as

It Is reported that: the San JFr&ncisco Labor;
Council refused .to Indorse . tb'a -boycott Â¦ placed t
upon the San Francisco . Baseball Club by tbÂ« -
Building Trades Council- of Â¥ San- Francisco.
This is misleading and tends to' place the La- Â«
bor Council In a false light before the public.
The action which, the San Francisco Labor
Council took was the following, as shown by
Â¦a exact cony from the minutes oft. Its secre
tary: "Pending a more- definite rpq.nest.for Â»*
boycott from the Varnishers' and Polishers'

The Laundry Workers', Strike.
The threatened strike in the white laun
dries, which was expected to occur Api'l
1, has been . averted by 7, an '; agreement
which was arrived at yesterday between
representatives of the -laundry proprietor*
and the Shirtwaist and Steam Laundry
Workers* Union. The result is very grati
fying to the unions,- as it insures a reduc
tion of the working day to ten hours and
establishes a new schedule .of.: wages that
means an average Increase of about' 2>
per cent. In order to meet the advance in
wages a raise In prices in certain classes
of work has been found necessary. Tno

ST. PETERSBURG. March 23.âEx
cellent observers believe that the
position of the Minister of the
Interior, M. Sipiguane, is unten
able and anticipate his resigna
tion wttMn a few months as a result of
the inability of the police to control the
turbulent elements. M. Sipiguane was
disposed to exculpaxe Lieutenant General
Kleig-Ie, Prefect of the St. Petersburg po
lice, until the Imperial Council on the
Tuesday after the great riot reported ad-
versely tc the Czar. Prince Viastimski,
a. member of the Imperial Council, who
was an eyewitness of the noting, won
over the council in an excellent speech.
It is underwood now that his resif?na.tlon.
which. \*as tendered after he had pro
a ?ted EKalnst the conduct of the police,
has not been accepted.
M. ; SipigTiane's latest proclamation
adojrted the point cf view of the Imperial
Council. A week after it had been issued
a. report was sent to the Czar by the
Grand Duke Michael, President of the
Imperial Council, whereupon his Majesty
pertinently demanded, according to Kood
authority, what M. Sipifniane, who is
head -of the police, had done to forestall
the troubles. Some people even hold that
the police agents provoked the affair.
The publication of the j>etition of twen
ty-eight professors to the Czar In an.
English paper has been the means of
bringing the petition before the Czar, as
the Czcrina reads the paper referred to
rejjularly. Eifirht professors of the St.
Petersburg University, three of the Mos
cow University, three of the Mining Acad
emy and five of the Engineering Institute
signed this appeal, which was for more
liberal university and jpolitical institu
tions.
The present university statutes, which
will probably be revised, were adopted in
3>*4. The Liberals then predicted their
failure.
Prof encor Bilbossoff Is . publishing
scathing criticisms of the statutes, pre
dicting more serious trouble than that
which has occurred.
tem of the Government: others presume that
th* recent disturbances were of such a nature
that they are likely to lead to irrave com
plications, the result of vrnich cannot be fore
seen; still others consider the reports sensa
tional and exaggerated.
It must be borne in mind that the Russian,
as a rule,' by nature and in accordance - with
his environments is of a passive disposition
and Indifferent as to his political status. Any
demonstration against the existing order In
Russia, however; Email, therefore become* sig
nificant and can be properly understood but
by describing the character of those partici-
I>atlr(r in the outbreaks and the nature of the
grievances they are - based upon.
Beginning of Disturbances.
The beginning of disturbances In the Russian
universities dates back to the year 1565, to
the liberating of â¢ the serfs by the liberal Czar
Alexander II." .The sudden changing of the
social and ' economical conditions of the maps
brought abouj., universal belief that a reorgan
ization of the "whole Government was at hand.
But nothing of the kind happened,' and the out
breaks in . the universities during that period
had a decidedly political aspect and were at
tributable /chiefly to the agitation of the nihii
istfi. though there hardly was a connection be
tween them and the students at large at any
time.
Since 1SS5. when the i.ew regulations relating
to the universities were enacted, the frequent
outbreaks in the variotM universities and high
schools of Rusirla have an entirely different
character. The new regulation* transformed
the unlverrltie* Into military schools. The
idea and purpose of these ukases apparently
was to prevent by strict discipline any political
aspirations of tHe students. But the admin
istration failed In enforcing the law and ths
students revolted almott Immediately after en
actment of the new regulations, and the dis
turbances in. the universities of Russia have
not ceased.
Grievances of the Students.
The principal objectionable features of the
regulations frota the standpoint of the students
consist In the restriction of their academical
freedom. 1hev object to the rule by virtue
of which the doorkeeper of the university, an
illiterate â¢"mushlk," has the power to -control
their daily appearance at the lectures, and
persistently demand a repeal of the rules con
cerning the examinations. According to â¢ the '
latter the ttudents Instead of one examination
at 'tha end of Â«-ach aca-lemical year, as it has
been bafore, have to pass several examinations
in the course of each year, besides being com
pelled for the purpos- of ' graduating to pass
a special examination before a committee ap
pointed by the administration and consisting
of high officials or proi>Â»sors of other univer
sities. There are, of course, many minor
grievances, but all of them are of a similar
nature and devoid of i-illtlcs.
The administration believes that an attempt
to satisfy the demand* of the students will
destroy the, discipline cf tHe universities/and
of late took recourse to the severe measure
of enrolling disorderly students In tha mlllury
service Â«nd sending tbem to the distant, pro
vinces of the empire. The studenta. on the
other hand, became more desperate, and'up
rising* In the universltleb of, Russia at present
are an every-day occurrence. There is, in
reality, no political significance In these out
bre&ks, though the university affairs undoubt
edly are greatly hammered. - - ". ' ' . â¢
Military Unwilling to Act.
A striking feature of the outbreaks. In ..Rus
sia, according to the reports, is the unwlll
infrness of the military forces â¢ to " subdue the
disturbances. The Russian army may -be call
ed a national one with more. reason than. any
other army or the world. The of fleers of, the
Russian army are- not like the German . or
French officers, a distinct class claiming . a
superior status in . their relations with civ
ilians. The Russian army by no means is a
pretorian army. The Russian officers, with
the exception of those of the Imperial guard,
are sons of the people and their, manner of life
Is plain and democratic Receiving a . very
i mall salary <a lieutenant receives . about $44
per month and can advance but very. slowly),
he has no possibility of .indulging ; in, any of
thÂ« habita bo peculiar to the military cast of
Europe. The officer, of the Russian . army . as
k rule Is a. modest gentleman and : earnestly
devoted to his duties. There : have . been . va
rious ukases recently issued to lift up . the
professional pride of the officers of. the army.
It has been, for Instance, ordered. by ukase
of the late Czar Alexander III -that, an officer
when Insulted is bound to fight a duel., and In
cafe of refusal to do so he is compelled . to
resign. iPWMSMVWnMBBBK

ACCUSES NEUISTADT
OF STEALING RING
Miss Ethel Reier Claims He Com
mitted the Theft in Her j
Boom.- .
OAKLAND, March. SO.â George Neui
ttadt, ,who eays he Is an agent, was ar
rested In San Francisco this afternoon on
a warrant sworn out by Miss Ethel Reier
of 607 Eighth street, charging him with
the larceny of a gold ring.
Miss Reier claims that Neuistadt- was
visiting her and that she laid her ring
upon a table while he was- in the room.
According to v her story she - missed the
ilng immediately afterward.
Xeulstadt said to-night that he had
known Miss| Reier for 'two years. Â¦ About
two ': weeks , ago, he said,' he ; and . the
young woman had a quarrel and lie re
turned her ring, which he had been wear
ing. He claims that Miss Reier is put
up to the present prosecution by another
man, -.who has .come between them. -He
denies ever having- written blackmailing
letters to her or to a,ny other person,
Fuch a charge having been made against
him.- â¢ " \ '
Neuistadt was arrested here in 1898 on
a charge of embezzling a sword from a
San Francisco man. The case was dropped
upon the recovery of the sword. The pris
oner-at that time claimed' to have. been a'
marine In the navy. Chief Hodg-klns, then
a detective,' . investiera ted Neuistadt'E
stories and found them to have been un
reliable.
.On, January 15 of -last year Chief of. Po
lice Blpjry of San Francisco received a
letter from Colonel Muse of the marine
corps at Vallejo to the effect that Neui
stadt had been masquerading as an officer
of marines and as one of Dewey's' heroes
of "Manila 'Bay.* Muse said 'the man > was
an impostor of the worst , type; that he
had served two terms for desertion and
that he had finally been dishonorably dis
charged from the Â» marines In December,
1899.
Neuistadt was arrested at another time
last year for Intimidating women by rep
resenting himself as a detective.- The cul
mination of this arrest was, the taking of
Neuistadt â¢ before the Insanity Â¦ Commis
sion. He Â¦Â¦was -.not committed, however,
because' it" was determined that r he was
more of a rogue than a maniac. â¢ -

Archbishop Takes Initiative
â¢ in Attempt to Remove r '
;. "Sir" Harry- Â¦Westwood./ Cooper, alias
Dr. Ernest Moore Chadwick, was denied
the relief, sought by writ of habeas corpus
yesterday, when Superior .Judge Carroll
Cook 'denied the. application: of the pris
oner and remanded him' into custody on a
charge of forging a. telegram with intent
to: deceive: Norine Schneider of .Crockett
and inducing her to. marry. him. Cooper's
attorney later in the day applied to the
Supreme Court for a writ of habeas
corpus.
Cooper was taken Into Judge Cook's
court with irons on his wrists, Chief Suili
van of the Police Department not caring
to take any risks with the prisoner while
transferring him from the 'Jail to the
courtroom.
A numcer of oases were disposed of by
Judge Look before he called the case of
Cooper, who nervously betrayed his inter
est in the proceedings. The court in giv
ing its decision said:
I have carefully examined Section 474 of. the
Penal Code and I can see . no reason to give
any - other construction : than the one . I gave
when this case was first presented to me. Â£ 1 am
of opinion that the Legislature, in passing the
section mentioned, did not Intend that the word
"torgery" i should have . the 'Â¦ same significance
as "It has in section 470 of the Penal Code.
Under section 474, the sending, of a forged tele
gram with the Intent. to deceive or defraud is
a felony and the punishment is in the discre
tion of the court. It certainly was the Inten
tion of the Legislature to make the forging of
a telegram, with Intent to deceive or defraud, a
criminal offense. If such a construction was
not given to the section such a crime as this
Is would go unpunished. ' The writ is dismissed
and the prisoner is remanded into custody.
' On motion of Assistant District Attor
ney Deuprey, Cooper \Â«is arraigned on
the Indictment found by the Grand Jury.
Cooper was requested to stand up while
the indictment was read. Clerk : Oscar
Tolle asked Cooper what his true name
was and the prisoner answered, "Ern
nest Moore : Chad wick." Clerk Tolle,
when once before asked Cooper to tell his
true name, received the - answer, "Harry
, Westwood Cooper." This was. when
Cooper was arraigned In 1S97 on a 'charge
of passing a fictitious check.- - Â¦Â¦'- * -
To the indictment charging him with
foiling a telegram with intent to deceive
and defraud Norine Schneider, Cooper
pleaded "not guilty." though his attorney
opposed It. After an argument the plea
was allowed to stand, with the privilege
of withdrawing It within five days. Judge
Cook placed the case on his calendar for
next Saturday morning-, and Cooper was
removed to the prison in the Hall of Jus
tice. .
â¢ In the afternoon the attorney for Cooper
filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
before the Supreme Court. The. grounds
' of the petition were the same as made be
; fore Judge- Cookâ that Cooper had.jnot
' been: guilty of- a public offense even- If 'It,
was admitted that" he had. sent the tele
gram in 'Question. ,..Â¦Â¦â¢ v "-- -. ".'".- â¢< ',
mlt\ Is understood that the District" At
torney's "office will-ask for a speedy trial
of Cooper, and 'in the event of his convic
tion a rer:uesfwlll be,made-to have him
sent to Folso'm instead of San Quentln. '

ADVANCE GUARD TAKES
THE SPRING HANDICAP
BY P.; E. MUIiHOIiAND.
ON Thursday, March 21, Advance
Guard, with Joe Piggott and 127
pounds on his back, finished third
to Tutblll and Star Chamber In a
. mile and a sixteenth handicap de
cided at Tanforan Park. On that occasion
Pigrrott fell in for. much unjust criticism
for his handling -, of the four-year-old,
which was not concurred in by the writer.
Advance Guard was not at hlmeelf that
day, and his performance certainly fooled
the handlcapper.
; Yesterday before the usual Saturday
gathering of racing enthusiasts , over the
same course Caxrut hers & Shields' gal
vanized son of imp. Great Tom captured
the Spring handicap at one and a half
miles, with the $4425 gross valuation at
tached thereto, completely astounding the
form flgurers. If his previous effort waa
for the handicapper's benefit it worked to
a charm, for yesterday he was asked to
pick up but 122 pounds. From threes the
odds against Guard gradually dropped 'to
8 to 5, while the opening quotation against
Star Chamber, carrying 104, flitted from
6 to 5 to 11 to 5, It seemed too far for
Vesuvian, especially as he looked an
chored with 116 up,' and of the other two
starters, Gauntlet and My Gypsy, the last
named 90-pounder | carried considerable
support on the strength of a very last
worK-out. A switch at the last moment
aaw.Mcunce carded to ride Advance
Guard instead of Piggott. From the start
there was only one horse in it. It did look
rosy for My Gypsy as she breezed out in
front for nearly a mile and a quarter, bat
all the while Mounce, astride the favor
ite, seemed to be only abiding his time.
Gypsy suddenly snapped like a broken
twig and Advance Guard rumbling Into
the front position beat .Star Chamber two
lengths in the fast time of 2:33. Of course
the argument may be advanced that
O'Connor did nof shine at his brightest
on Star Chamber, which he certainly did
not, but there could onlv have been ons
result. Vesuvian finished third and My
Gypsy, pulling up very' lame, fourth. If
valuable horses can show such reversals
it leaves little loophole for officials to
complain about the in and out running of
cheap selling platers.
Very few or the bookmakers laid away
any money, as five choices, and all of
them handsomely bucked, landed in front.
O'Connor distinguished himself by cross
ing the line on three winners In Sir'King
s.ton. The Phoenician and Rosormonde. j
J. Ransch piloted the first winner pasÂ«t
the wire in Princess Tttanla. Stemler's
filly closed a slight favorite over Vain,
and when half the route had been-cov
ered took the lead from Alas. Vain closed
well, but the Princess held him safe, scor
ing handily by a length. Show honors
went to Decoy.
It would appear that Sir Kingston has
suddenly regained his form, for he was
given plenty of time to take the mile sell
ing run which followed, and did It easily.
Backed by the smart ones from 2 to 3 to
2. the gelding passed Mission on the
stretch turn, winning easily. Alicia led
Walkenshaw,' the opening favorite, out
for the show.
Dr. Rowell's gelding The Phoenician, at
odds of 18 to 5, turned up a handy winner
of the second mile selling run. Passing
Sir Hampton at the final quarter, he led
Vohlcer out a half-length. Edgardo. the
favorite, was bumped by the winner, "fin
ishing- fourth.
While St. Slmonian received stanch
backing to win the mile and a sixteenth
run, Rosormonde, the favorite, led from
pt art . to finish. . Turner on St. Slmonian
met with various kinds of hard luck,
though taking the place from Morelllto
by a neck.
After dislodging: his rider. J. Daly, in
an i attempt to beat the barrier in the
closing mile selling number, Goldone
eventually delivered the poods. He led
all the way, passing the judges more than
a length in advance of MacGyle. Great
land,' backed from 10 to 4, took the show.
Track Notes.
"Longshot . Conley rode his first race
since being reinstated on Morelllto.
"Dick" Dwyer and "Jake"- Holtman,
without doubt America's greatest start
ers, will both be Been. here next season.
By an agreement practically completed
with Thomas H. Williams Jr. yesterday
the two will alternate during the Califor
nia racing season of 1901-02. Jake Holt
man will probably be compelled to depart
for the East before the close of the pres
ent season at Oakland, in which case F.
Â£2. Mulholland has been engaged to oc
cupy the starter's stand.
INSURANCE MEN WIN
FROM STANFORD'S TEAM
Desultory Basaball at Recreation
.â¢ Grounds Proved a One-
Sided Affair.
The Fireman's Fund team defeated
Stanford yesterday afternoon at Recrea
tion Grounds by a score of 10 to 3 after a
most Indifferent, desultory sort of game.
At no time waa the insurance team in
dangrer of a defeat. The lack of excite
ment and Interest in the game, due to its
unevenness, made It painful to watch.
This was the twelfth game played by the
Fireman's Fund this season, eleven of
which proved victories. The score: -

: Initial Performance Was
Very Good.'
The fly casters bega,n the season at Stow

all the old-time experts augru rs success
for the season.
The results were:
Hounds, of. Record Are Much in Evi
dence in the Â¦ Regular Weekly
v Event at Union Coursing
,,..;;Â¦:,: Pin*. , .... Â¦
The run-down of the 112-dog open stake
and- two rounds of a sapling -event made
up a card of good coursing yesterday for
the patrons of Union Park. The older
performers put up some good work, and
the big stake will hold the record for some
time to come as a . banner one for the
talent. t . .
During the running but four short ends
broke the monotony, and pikers were
scarce long before the last race, bo true
did the results come tbe way of the wise
ones. Kine Fire ran well but was in
jured In the course. If the injury does not
keep him from running to-day he, has a
good chance, with Bona Fide. Rector made
the best snowing.of the day, leading and
beating the fast \Wed5ew00d with ease.
This claver youngster furnished one of the
few .upsets,- 5 to 3 being the odds quoted.
Curtis hounds look a good outside possi
bility for stake honors.
Harlean Gladys and Fiery Face were
forcad.to do, three hard goes before a de
cision could be.tcalled. .The dogs broke
even. on sreed to the hare. John Doe is
rounding into form after a season of in
termittent-sickness. He led and beat
Hurricane, making a clean score. McCar
thy's rourser appears to have, the call
over Brutus in the second round..
Lady. Clare did ;> not put up as rood a
course a'Â» .was -expected of her. After se
curing the- turn from Master Davenport
she came near to being defeated. .
Keaiey's other entry, Tiburon. was a
surprise.,. He led and beat Spiteful quite
handily."" Spiteful -was a good 2 to 1 favor
ite. Game Boy held -Moso level to the
hare, but irom there on Mose did the rest
of the work a. id kept the Boy from mak
ing a point. ; .' . -
Stantonin is one'of the fastest dogs in
the stake and will have a strong following
in to-day's" finals. He is unfortunate In
being against Rural Artist in the second
round. Artist. makes his iirst course his
best one - and Santonin will have hard
work to get the flag. Artjst figures to
"just win,".. .
Luxor is in goftd : position to reach, sec
ond--place. < It is the old story with Palo
Alto.-a strong first choice in the betting.
Hot- Haste had the longest cou"rse of tho
day. with* King '.Cob, who gave him no
assistance. ;,lle comes back after a hard
go generally in good shape and is a factor
in the running, "Roman Athlete led Mamie

Csulocan was the other record-breaker
of the day. He navisated the 220 eprfnt
in 22 4<> seconds, reducing the track rec
ord, which was formerly 23 fiat. In this
Â«vÂ«nt Brown, who had secured second
p-la.ee in ttie 100-yaxd. dash, stumbled in
roundiiiK the lower turn. His fall threw
Townsond and Herreschoff out of the race

The work in the field tras scarcely of the.

In most of tb* track events there Is room
for considerate improvement. Duden.
Â¦who annexed first placo in the pole vault,
poeseeses a. great quantity of strength,
â¢but lacks the style wfclch comes with
practice and experience. Cooley and Pow

IN the anneal championship field day

was held yesterday afternoon on the
Berkeley trzck t> Service was the
bright, particular star. I He succeed
ed In clipping- three and a half seconds off
the coast record and five and a. half sec
cnÂ£s off the college record for the mile
run.
The day was ideal for athletic sports
and the crack sprinter of the -university
was never ia tetter condition. After ho
crossed the tape ta his record-breaking
attempt he still had strength in reserve,
and had there been a. man in tire race to
press him the record would now be still
lower. Service's performance, besides
ptampirieT him a* the speediest mile
sprinter that thÂ« University of California,
ever produced, entitles him to the polil
medal offered by John Elliot of the Olym
pic Club as the first smasher of thÂ« old
record.
Â¦work In both hurdle races. He secured
first place in both In reasonably fast time.
His work yesterday, makes it evident that
with a little more training and experience
he will make an excellent hurdler.
In the UW-yard race, the second event
on the programme, the fight for second
place furnished a very spectacular flnlsh.
In this event Cadogan 7 took the lead from
the scratch and won out in 10 2-5 seconds,
with more than a yard to spare. For the
second position Townsend maintained a
slight lead until within a yard and a half
from the tape, when Brown shot ahead
of him and won by the slightest margin.
The hammer-throw was declared off.

LONDON, March 30.â Oxford's cox
swain "snatched a victory from Cambridge
to-day in a boat. steering race after the
light blues (Cambridge) had led by a
length and a half at Barnes, bridge, an ad
vantage which at that point Is supposed
to mean a sure victory. The crews were
so evenly matched that all rested upon
clever steering. V In this S alone the dark
blues (Oxford) had the advantage.
The weather could hardly have becri
worse. Rain fell all night and with ,a
strong south wind made a discouraging
outlook. The race was upstream - on â¢ a
flood tide, with a seven-knot breeze on
the port quarter at the start, which was
made at 10:25 a. m.
Both crews rowed down to the- starting
skiffs. There was little to choose between
them in action or physique. At Colonel
Willans' signal the crews caught the
Â¦water together, but Cambridge's snappy
stroke gave that crew a shade the better
of the start. Cambridge rowed thirty-four
strokes to the minute at the start and Ox
ford thirty-five, which Csoon brought' the
dark bliies abreast of â¢ Cambridge, giving
them a fractional lead, which they
lost before Hammersmith bridge was
reached. . Cheers rase from Cambridge's
steamboat as their boat passed this point
half a length ahead. On the Oxford
steamer there was silence and" anxiety.
At Thornycrofts very rough water was
met and the turn of the: course brought
the 'wind around and ahead. ; There the
superiority of the Brocas (Oxford) boat
showed itself. Both crews dropped their
stroke to twenty-nine, but Oxford was
the steadier. Still Cambridge gained. At
Barnes bridge the lead was a length and
a half. Then the Oxford champions on
the Oxford steamer gave tongue for the
first time and yelled encouragement , to
their crew. The response was . install*
taneous and as heart breaking as the pace
had been for the first mile, which waa one
second under the record, Oxford quickened
her stroke to thirty- two and then to
thirty-four, and Cambridge quickened to
thirty-six. But the latter lacked the'driv
ing power of Oxford,, who went up, foot
by foot The crowds on the banks caught
the contagion of the struggle and surged
along toward the finish. Â¦ Â¦
In tbe last 200 yards Oxford's bow began
to ehow ahead arÂ»d, sh^ relentlessly over
hauled" Cambridge, who rowed, strong, to
the, finish. -: Nevertheless deep throated
cheers arose as the crews flashed between
the red flacaat the finish and Cambridge
saluted Oxford as they ceased rowing.
Then, to the American spectators, came
a- surprising: feature. â¢ The winning i crew
rowed to their landing- place and carried
In their own oars and txiat, instead of be-
Insthempelvea carried in on the shoulders
of their admirer a as, would happen in the
case of an/American crew.
The time at - the main v. 'point* of the
course was : -, = CrVen Steps, Â¦: 3 minutes - 23
seconds: mile, a tnlnutes 54 aeconcU>: (beat-

Why Softer From This Dreadful Disease, When
Science Has Conquered It?
Nearly one j thonsand permanent cures have been
made here in your midst. Over five hundred in the city
of San Francisco alone; business men of tne first rank,
some of whom yon may know, and who for the sake of
suffering humanity are willing 1 to be privately In-
terviewed.
There is nothing: to dread; the treatment is faultless ;
no surgery, caustics, ligature or salves, and no delay
from business. â¢
ANY CASE, NO MATTER HOW SEVERE OR OF HOW
LONG STANDING, no matter how many salves you may
have tried (for they are all delusions), can be perma-
nently cured in. a very short while if,- scientifically
treated by a skilled PHYSICIAN.

LONDON, March 30.â In reply to a ques

as to the selection of a defender In tha
races for the America's cup, Sir Thomas
Lipton made this statement to-day:
"I wish to say nothing which can pos
sibly be construed as a criticism or as
gratuitous advice to the United States. I
want only to meet the best boat America
can build. I never want any one to be
able to say after the cuff races: 'You have
won, but you have not beaten our beat
boat.' My ideas on the subject can beat
be gathered from what IÂ»am doing myself.
I am putting the Shamrock II Into open
competition with any boat in the world."
Regarding his plans. Sir Thomas LJp
ton said:
"As soon as possible after the launch
ing I am going to the Solent to hav*e ths
trials. On my way back to the Clyde I
shall probably accept the Royal Yacht
Club, Kingston, invitation to race there.
Then I shall go to the Clyde and enter tho
Glasgow exhibition contests. As soon aa
possible after that, probably about June
12, the Erin and Shamrock II will sail
for America. I have not yet decided if
Shamrock I will accompany them. WÂ«
shalt first go to the Azo*a- to replenish
our fuel, for on the last trip I found the*
Erin's coal capacity scarcely equal to tha
long, slow voyage. I trust there will bo
sufficient wind to avoid much towing, for
I believe that towing, on account of tha
strain involved. Is much more harmful to
yachts than sailing'. I expect the yachts
will arrive In New York early in July.
After the cup races, unless something un
expected prevents it. I will accept tha
Boston Board of Trade Invitation to take
Shamrock II to that city and have a llttla
racing in New England waters."

County Surveyor Robinson returned Tuesday
from Green Mountain, where he had spent sev

the copper propeitles there has been almost at

tart-roads, though Indication* show that the
copper deposits are among the most colossal
.of the country. Several days 'ago three well
known experts inspected the properties which
are now held ' by O. R." Sidney at Green Moun
toln. "These men were' supposed to have been
sent out by the Boston and Montana Com
pany, and while their report was not made
public' they stated ' that the led?e on Green
Mountain was so extensive an to be almost be

and carrying copper In paying quantities. In
vcveloping the hill mi"e a large cave or nat

rich copper ore. The cave forms a natural
drifts all that is necessary being to stope out
the ore. The copper mine bonded from C. R.
Hughes to Miles Wallace, located near the
old Green mine, will be worked in a few days.
The hauling. of timbers, which was Impeded by'
tho bad weather. , Is now under way. Green
Mountain district promises to take a leading
position in the value of mineral production.
The Marlpotan says:
The new chlorlnatlon plant at the Shawmut
mine ' has started up. The furnace used In
roasting the ore uses oil for fuel. At the
Dcnsmore mine work for the new ten-stamp
minis going energetically forward. A large
fcrce of men are at work excavating:. A four
stamp mill was formerly on the property.' At
the Mount Lily mine, the clean-up of the mill

the five-stamp mill. An immense body of
-.vater Is flowing at present in Five-mile Creek
near this property.
the neighborhood of Furnaceville, says
the Redding Searchlight, has been bond

Six Jttontlis Taken Off the Suspension
of License of Captain
Miller.
Captain John Benningham. United
States Supervising. Inspector of Local and
Foreign Steam Vessels, handed down a
report yesterday In the matter of the ap
peal of Captain Frederick Miller, master
of the steam schooner Cleone. wrecked
on Point Gorda December C, 1900.
United States Inspectors Bolles and Bul
ger had suspended Miller's license for
twelve months from January 23, 1&31. and
Miller appealed. Captain Bermingham
says:
"In view of the fact that a delay, of
about a month In the trial of the appel
lant by the lower court was caused by
reason of the unavoidable absence of In
spector Bolles in Seattle, and the further
fact that no loss of life occurred by the
unskillfulness of the appellant in navigat
ing the Cleone, 197 gross tons, a propor
tionally small Eteamer, I don't think so
heavy a penalty bhould have been visited
upon him as would have been had he un
der similar circumstances lost a eteamer
of 1000 tons or upward, by which human
life had been sacrificed. Therefore I
think the interests of justice will be
served If the time of the suspension of the
license of the appellant be reduced from
twelve to six months from and aTter Jan
uary 23, which Is ao ordered."

that where thirty buildings stood he filed
a quartz mining claim and that the land
belongs exclusively to him. . He has
ordered builders to suspend operations
The controversy is as to whether the title
has lapsed by reason of the non-perform

law. Land holders are defying Sherk and
a lawsuit Is liable to involve nearly all

HEART DISEASE TAKES
AWAY RANDALL SHOAFr
Formerly a Partner of Edward Fay
in the Grand Hotel Bar
Business.
Randall Shoaff, formerly a partner of
Ed l-'ay In the Grand Hotel bar, died sud
denly yesterday afternoon at 18 Mason
strett, presumably from heart disease,
with which he had been afflicted for a
long time. Mr. Shoaff was a. native of
Maiyland, 64 years old and a widower.
A daughter-in-law, Mra. Cora M. Shoaff,
lives in Benlcla. Â¦
During the past few days there have
been frequent meetings between the sep
arated couple, the parents of the young
wife and the attorneys on both sides in
the office of J. D. Sullivan. The- .latter waa
advised yesterday that everything had
been happily arranged. The husband has
been restored by his brothers to the re
sponsible position of manager of the res
taurant and oyster business left by his
father in the California Market. He has
"sworn off" his bad habits that are said
to have been the cause Of matrimonial
disturbances. . For the present, with their
Infant child, marital life will be resumed
In' a boarding-house.
"I am satisfied," said Mrs. Moraghan'i
attorney, J. D. Sullivan, "that the young
man Intends to' do what is right In the
future. His brothers have reposed con
fidence in him, and I think that this Is a
most happy consummation of his and her
differences. It Will now be only a matter
of a day or two when all legal obstruction
to their reunion; will be removed."
Both the parties to the action are young.
Mrs. Moraghan is but 18, while her hus
band is about five years her senior.
It Is reported ; likewise that the young
wife's father, Police Officer James Fay,
and her mouther, who have been separated
for a number of iyears, have also decided
to let by-gones be by-gones. They fre
quently were compelled to meet at her
attorney's office, and it is said are re
solved to reunite for the balance of life's
Journey.-
Matters reached a climax a few days
ag^o while, the eult for divorce instituted
by the young plaintiff, for she is not yet
out of her teens, was pending In the
Superior Court before Judge Seawell.
Perhaps the frequent meetings In the
court room had something to do with fan
ning Into a new fire the spark of love, and
on yesterday they finally decided to try
over again, and as soon as the necessary
legal papers and agreements can be tiled
the divorce suit will be dismissed.
Once more | the power of love- ' has as
serted Itself In the case of Mary Gwen
dolyn' Moraghan (nee Fay) and' James
B. Moraghan, her husband, whose
differences have been a subject of court
Inquiry for some months past.

MORAGHAN'S WIFE
NOW RECONCILED
With a party of newspaper men and Mr.
Jacobs of the Munyon Remedy Company,
they visited Tanforan yesterday. and inci
dentally took In the races. It was a
breezy afternoon, and when in the fourth
race Rolling Boer was left at the post
Senator Smith was thrown into a reminis
cent mood. He said: â¢ ;
"That horse getting left at the post re
minds me of a very remarkable incident
regarding luck which may sound like a
fairy tale; but it's gospel truth, all right.
"Several years ago the late Jerry Simp
son and I chanced to be together on a trip
East, and one night when we were taking
in some of the Bights of New York we
were about to enter one of the large gam
bling resortK.-when at the door I stooped
and picked up a two-dollar bill. Jerry ex
claimed. 'That's a piece of luck. Dumont:
we II put It on roulette.' I assented, and
Jerry tried his luck with it. When he had
taken in $45 I said. 'Jerry, I'm not seeking
great wealthâ half of that's a competence
for me: let's pull out.' and we did. Next
day we went down to the races, and on
tHe way Simpson, who was custodian of
the funds, said, â¢'Smith, I'm going to place
this $15 on the longest shot we can playâ
that's a lucky $2.' We agreed on that,
and when we got down to the track we
saw a GO to 1 shot up, so we went through
the paddocks until we found the horse.
He was a gaunt individual, with a wart
on his left foreleg that looked like a big
bog spavin, but we decided at 50 to 1 he
looked all right and started back to put
up our money. On our way we met our
friend Allen hÂ»re, and he tofd us that he
knew the Jockey who was* to ride .Nellie
S. posted at 5 to 1, and that it was a sure
shot, as she was booked to win. So we
were persuaded to put the money on Nel
lie S. The gong sounded and we went out
to watch the race, and you may. search
me if that 50 to 1 horse didn't win the race
by over .three lengths, vith Nellie S left
at the post! Now, wouldn't that Jar you?
Funny part of it was that Jerry and I
were together about ten days longer, oc
cupying beds in the same room, and I no
ticed every, night about 10 o'clock, when
I had taken off my coat and vest, that
Jerry would say, 'Well, Smith. I guess I'll
go out- and get a bit of fresh air before
turning in,' and he wouldn't get back un
til after midnight.. It 'didn't impress me
particularly until dno 'day I found a slip
of addresses that -he had. dropped, and
some pt them had been- checked off. Tfcey
were in a pretty hard locality, so I deter
mined to drop out after Jerry that night
when he went out for fresh air; I followed
him along and saw him go to the entrance
of.several gaming resorts, but the strange
part of It was he didn't enter, so after
about an hour's -walk I went up to him
and said, 'For heaven's sake, Jerry what
are you after?' He replied, with one of
those droll smiles of his, 'Dumont. I am
looking for another two-dollar bill.' "
The Kansas gentlemen will be here sev
eral days. Senator Smith will doubtless
be sent to Washington by the next Legis
lature to represent the State in the Sen
ate, and Senator Allen is looked upon as
the winner of gubernatorial honors In the
next campaign.
When asked about his State's latest
freakâ Mrs. Nationâ Senator Allen said:
"Oh. that is merely a little horseplay we
have once in a while. It advertises the
State in a way, but will not work material
harm. You Bee, we are very gallant to
ward the ladies, but we know about the
time to quit" giving out any more rope. A
State which gave to the Union such a reg
iment as theTwentietn Kansas Volun
teers and so brave a general as Funston
need not worry about such minor excres
cences as occasionally afford amusement
for the columns of the press."

Dumont Smith. of Kansas are In the city

the coast climate, which, they state, com
pares favorably with the zephyr-Wssed

Dried Fruit in Nezv York.
Latest ictJl afirtces from New York ray:
"Prune demand keep* up well, and although
Â£JS7 psck&res of dried fruits, mostly prunes,
were received, during the eix business days
Of last week stocks continue light and arrivals
aro reported absorbed about, as rapidly as they
reach the market. At the close the scarcity
of 60-eOs was particularly acute and few of
th!e elze were available unSer l\c. Coast ad
vices report no probable change In the policy
ef the association and that a limited quantity
of outside stock in broken assortments of
B'.zes is offered on the basis of 2%o to S^c for
the 'four sizes. 1 It Is regarded, however. &s '
tfouhtful whether &=y Urge quantity could be
had At either of the above, figures. The out
look so tmr mm the epoc market on California
prunes is concerned favors a steady basis,
w.th poesltly higher prices as stocks clean up.
'The feeling in raisins Improved consider
ably during the week as a result of the Cured
Fruit Association's action In withdrawing- the
â¢xport rettfU* end a little business wao done
at 65 for 3-crown loose, but generally shak
ing California raisins are dull. A little better
trade is doing in Imported raisins, but the
market Is easy. Figa are selling In a Email
way. Currants dull. A little trade is doing;
in fancy apricots asd unpeeled peaches. Ap
jaes are Â£ull and easy."

traction stocks. Lake Erie and Western and
Tennessee Coal. Realising had already affected
these advances before the appearance of the
bank statement. The bears Bold the market
on the large inroad madÂ« upon the surplus re
serves of the banks and caused declines run
ning to a point In some cases. Supporting
orders were met and the rally was made effect
ive by a sudden and violent rise In Rock
Island to 136, an advance over last night of
6V points. Atchlson was marked up 1\ at the
seine time. A revival of old rumors of a com
bination between the two systems accompanied
the advance. Rock Island fell back sharply
on realizing and the closing of the market was
feverish and Irregular, with profit-taking In
force at some points In the list. The United
States Steel stocks did not fluctuate more than
a fraction, but the dealings In them was very
large. There were wide advances In a num
ber of high-grade and usually Inactive stocks,
including Lackawanna, Morris and Essex. Pull
man and Colorado Fuel preferred, running from
S% to 10 points, the latter figure for Colorado
Fuel preferred. The decline In the cash re
serves -of the banks was less than had been
estimated, but the loan expansion of $6,U0,S0O
Â¦made additional reserve requirements and so
encroached on the surplus.
Another eventful week has passed In the
stock market, with a very animated and varied
speculation in full swing. The daily average
of transactions has run well over a million
shares of stock and over $5,OCO,000 In par value
of bonds. TTiere has been a constant digestion
of speculative profits on a very large ecale
and this has encouraged the bear party to go
short of the market occasionally in the con
fidence that the culmination of the rise had
been reached and that they would have gt>od
opportunity to cover their short contracts later
on in the expected perl>l of active speculative
liquidation, but the continued largo demand
for s-tocks and the recurrence of rumors re
garding plans for the betterment of Individual
properties have as orten driven the bears to
cover ar.d have absorbed the selling to take
profits with only slight damage to prices. The
conviction remained Btropg, in spite of official
disclaimers and downright denials, that plan*
Â»ere ripe for the absorption of the Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy system In the interests
of the Hill-Morgan combine, looking to a
transcontinental system, including the Erie,
the Burlington, the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern. Rumors of the terms of the
deal have been numerous and divergent, in
cluding assertions of a lease with guaranteed
dividend, a caeh payment for the stock and
an exchange for guarantee bonds. Â¦ The ad
mission for trading in the Unlisted department
of the Stock Exchange of the United Statee
Steel stocks, when issutd, proved an incitement
to the general speculation. The prices ', to
which theee storks hud risen In the narrow
trading on the curb onered handsome profits
for- the stocks of the constituent companies
which were exchanged, compared with the
prices of thoee stocks before the merger. There
was an apprehension that, with the greater
facilities tor trading ottered on the Stock Ex
change, there would be such heavy realizing
In the new 6tocks as to force them downward,
with resulting bad effect on the general mar
ket, but it became manifest very promptly
that these stocks were not to be left without
support. There was an organized and skillful
support at the outset and the realizing was
largely absorbed <ani prices renewed. This
gave renewed confidence to the whole specula
tion and the trading in the steel Blocks formed
an Important element In the market during
the latter part of the week. ThÂ» belief that
plans were working out for a general combina
tion of Southwestern railroads made another
center of speculative activity. Missouri Pa
clflo continued the leading flg-ure in this move
ment and the Colorado roads were very con
spicuous and strong. The market was highly
professional and speculative during the whole
week, as shown by the volume of transactions
In Individual Etocks, which were sufficient to
have effected a change of control in many
stocks had they represented any proportion of
actual transfers. The good reports of business
in most lines all through the country and the
continued - high - leval of railroad earnings
rormed an effective underlying support for the
whole (peculation. 1
Ttoe strength of the bond market has not
teen so conspicuous and so general this week,
but points of strength have continued to de

CHICAGO, March SO.â Trade in corn for May
delivery became active at the tap of the open
ing gong. Within half an hour it had assumed
vast proportions. Half the wheat pit had de
serted to it and many traders were crowded
out of bounds at, times.-. George H. Phillips
took profits on a scale Approaching bis opera
tions of yesterday, yet so excited was the
trade that he was not more conspicuous than
many others. In fact It looked as If the,mar
ket was beyond the. control of this spirited
young bull, or beyond the control of any com
bination. May opened M@%c higher at 44%c to
44'ic and early touched 44c on selling said < to
have been for Phillies. The buying craze was
on, however. . and it struck this plight dip in
full force. May corn was bought and sold in
such quantities and with such rapidity by the
whole pit tbat Individual . trades were lost to
view. The market bounded to the record price
of 44*ic in the next half-hour. The remainder
of the session it was give and take between
th<* big demand and offerings from â¢ enriched
longs. May was forced back to 44r*;e, but held
strong and closed %Â®?ic over yesterday at 44^4
@44%c.
In activity and strength the oats market was
tecond only to corn. This market, ordinarily
neglected and without even a pit to call its
own, made the wheat trade look dismal by
comparison. The band of Phillips was at woik
in the market, his purchases during the day
being approximated at 3,000,000 bushels. , May
closed' Ho hUher at 26%c.
The attenuated remnant of traders left In
the. wheat pit was bearish and had It not been
for the com strength it Is highly probable the
market would have declined more than It did.
Trade was light -and the range narrow. May
opened He to %&Mc lower at 76Vic to 76S"6',ic.
and sold early to 76c on heavy Australian ship
ments and favorable weather. In sympathy
with corn a reaction to 76%c followed, but de
spite late assurances of export Inquiry., the
market eased off later and closed %c under
yesterday at 76%c. . . .
Light hog receipts, the corn strength and an
advance In prices at the yards were reflected
In higher prices for provisions. May poik
closed 20o over yesterday, lard 12%Â®15c higher
and ribs 12V4c improved.- . .
The leading futures ranged as follows:

NEW YORK, March 30. â The Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market here was extremely ' Inactive
to-day,* but prices were steady. In the Ameri
can department stocks opened below parity,
hardened as the day. progressed and closed at
tho top. London bought St Paul, Ontario and
Western and Erles.Â» The Continent showed an
inclination to take profits. Money was in good
demand. The bank bought Â£15.000 gold bars.
London Market.
The Financier says: The bank statement for
the week contains several surprising features.
It had been figured that the Interior had for
warded but little money to this center and the
Bubtivasury statements showed a loss by the
clearlng-houEe institutions of about four mil
lions. The Inference was that the cash re
serves of â¢ the bunks, Â¦ by reason of the two
operations, had been reduced several millions,
but the weekly exhibit reveals a loss of only
$1,445,700. which, of course, puts a more favor
able aspect on the situation. For all that, how
ever, the position of the banks has not been
strengthened, since the expansion of $6,110,800
in loans brought about a corresponding rise
In deposits, necessitating more reserve, and the
effect Is shown In a decrease of $2,401,925, which
brings the present excess to $7,870,500, the low
efit average reported since I>cccmber 15 last.
The expansion of $6,110,800 in Ioan3 can be
traced to changes in one or two large banks
and represents speolal transactions. As a
matter of fact the . leading Items Were all In
fluenced In this way so that aside from a very
few institutions the position of the individual
institutions does not vary much from the pre
ceding week. The statement on Its face fore
casts a firmer. condition; in tha money market,
but to what extent It is difficult to deem. The
export of a small amount of gold on a special
order during the week has given rise to many
conjectures of an impending. movement, but
it Is to be jsald that normal conditions do not
warrant this belief. The exchange price Is
so dependent upon domestics money rates that
the slightest derangement of the present level
will upset all calculations. An . advance in
rates here may also bring to this center what
ever money is now lying: idle at other points.
The general opinion Is that the critical point
of the season is being tided over and Viat be
tween coming . treasury disbursements and re
ceipts of new gold before summer, a reasonable
assurance of a satisfactory market is not want-
Ing. The heavy deals which have marked the
first quarter of the year are being adjusted and
cannot be regarded as dominating the market
to the exclusion of all other business. It was
noted that the banks sent considerable money
to one or two large centers In the Interior last
week in response to demand, due no doubt to
local causes. The United Btates Steel Corpora
tion payment of $25,000,000 and April dividend
disbursement so far have not Influenced the
situation perceptibly. . .

Blood poisoning resulting frora varcina
tios caused the death last night of MlÂ«s
Viola Myrtle Yoakum. a "Western 4 Union
telegraph operator, ?â¢mployed in 6an
Francisco. Miss Yoakum was vaccinated
by. a San Francisco physician about three
weeks ago. The sore on her arm caused
by the virus became bo painful that she
w&s compelled to remain at home for sev
eral days. As soon as nhe felt able she
went back to work, but the arm began
troubling her again <uid medical aid was
summoned. Yesterday afternoon acute
eyznptoms set in and the unfortunate girl
died at about midnight at the home of her
sister, Mrs. E. A- Young, at 951 Union
street.. .. â¢ . . f â¢.:.â¢Â¦.
Miss Yoakum was IS vears of age and
was a beautiful glr!. She was held in
high esteem -by a large circle of acquaint
ances.
About a month ago the young- lady tola
& friend that she was in constant dread of
smallpox and was advised to consult a
physician and be inoculated against th-Â»
disease. She did so and felt no special
alarm at the resulting inflammation until
last Wednesday, when Dr. J. F. Rinehdrt
was called In. Under his treatment the
patient Improved until vesterdav, whex. .a
change for the worse set in. Dr. Rinehart
called Drs. Stratum and Wilcox Into con
sultation. They found the young lady's
arm terribly swollen and diagnosed the
case as acute blood poisoning. It was de
cided that the only hope of saving the pa
tient's life lay in amputation, but she
Erew worse bo rapidly that the surgeons
saw that she could not survive the opera
tion. It was therefore abandoned.
The case of Miss Yoakum is one of sev
eral which have been recently reported by
local physicians as the result of vaccina
tion.
E>r. Rinehart claims that Miss Yoakum's
death was not due to faulty virus or to
the method of Jts application, but resulted
from taking cold In and using the affectad
erm before it was sufficiently healed over
