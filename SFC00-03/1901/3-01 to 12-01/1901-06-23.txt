next best thing, which is to get as far
away from her as possible. That Is . a
way that lovers have. They are a trifle
pouty and inclined to make things as hard
for themselves as they know how if they
cannot have all their own way.
There is another reason - perhaps for
some of his slight eccentricities.
Shortly after leaving school he was In
dulging in the national sport of fox hunt-
ing, and while racing across the wold to
head the "hounds, his horse fell, throwing
him to the ground and injuring him' so
severely . that it was years Â¦ before (, he re
covered. His health never entirely recu
perated, and he still shows' a mixture of
the delicacy " which continued 'ill ' health
brings, yet overborne and negatived by
his naturally forceful character.

[ The desire to become a recluse as far as
concerned the life. he had known led the
lover, to*' studying accounts of "far-away
lands. In a newspaper advertisement of a
land' cumpany he saw "a description of

Ar.d speaking of tigers, not irrelevantly
In this case, brings in the idea, that the"
question of the lady or the tiger is dead
easy, but when it comes to two ladies,
foolish is the man who doce not rather

The Chinese character which means
trouble is a composite of the characters
meaning a man and two women.
That's trouble for you.
Trouble, too, for William Hicks-Beach,
not always of Baktrsfield.
He wanted to marry one; his mother
would that he married the other. Of one
he will not speak â the one that he would
marry. Her name is sacred with him.
Of the other b> mill only say that, while
wealthy and of high social position, she
had r.o charms for him. as no woman
should have for the true lover of another.
William Hicks-Beach, for the present
of Bakersfield. is the eldest son of Wil
liam Frederick Hicks-Beach of Glouces
ter. England, from whom he will inherit
upon that gentleman "S death 15,000 acres
of land, with the shorthorns and cots
wolds on the downs and the red deer that
run through park and forest.
Think you that his mouth sometimes
waters for the famous double Gloucester
cheese, the saddles of mutton and
haunches of venison that load the pater
nal board at home, while he subsists on
the standard California diet of pork and
pancakes in oily Bakersfield?
Not so, friend, for he is one of those
etrange animals, a lover, and, like the
Â¦whole tribe of them, enjoys doing the
queerest of things to make men yawp.
After all, is it so bad to ride around on
a hack and think that back there in
Merrie England â good, green, healthy,
wealthy England â therÂ« la waiting for
you a eirl and a fortune?
Would that we were all as lucky !-
Hicks-Beach Is 33 years old, a graduate
of the Charterhouse School, Surrey, a
captain In the English a,rmy and was a
member of one of Rhodes* Irregular com
panies whica did so much skirmish fight

broke out.

he is here. Why? Simply to be at the

â¢would marry him.
Still he drives the hack In Bakersfield.
The Right Hon. Sir Michael Ed
ward is not to be blamed in this case,
either, though he is an uncle, for William
Hicks-Beach of oily Bakersfield has let
ters of pleasant temper from the august
member of the British Cabinet and from
his wife, the Lady Lucy Catherine,

That might not be so much, either, for
rich uncles are given to delight In the
sight of poverty stricken nephews, with
their noses on the grindstone: but it hap
pens that this particular nephew is heir
to a 15.000-acre estate In the shire of.
Gloucester. England. *
Not only does he drive a hack, but he
puts in part of his time as a handy man
around the theater, shifting scenery and
making himself useful in the many end
less ways that are expected of assistants
behind the scenes. Yet he is no more of
the place than a hermit would be. Â¦ Kis
body is there, but his heart is far away.
Across the sea, not far from the banks of
the Severn, there is a girl that is waiting.
More than thatâ there are two queenly.

girl and tfce others he will hold time, fam
ily and even the best part of himself well

He is waiting for a father to die-^-a father
who will be all the more to him when he
is gone. He Is dying himself. . All hi3
youth Is, dying away from him, leaving
him a shellâ mentally and; physically a
shell. And what for? For. the .difference'
between one ' girl and , another. A differ-,
ence that the scales would not tell. A
difference -that â¢. the keenest analyst In
chemical iesearch could not observe. A
difference that the" camera, which holds
the " fleeting shadows, might show . to be
in favor of a thousand, ten thousand'oth
ers, -who would be glad to have this man
of wealth and family.;: ;."'".*-.T
Is love worth while? is a question, that
Â¦William Hicks-Beach must be better able
to answer than most, for he is a man who
can feel keenly and live without forget
ting. He has seen himself rapidly ag'ng";
his mother has been laid in her grave un-'
seen by him. He has never heard words
of forgiveness from her lipsâ never can.'
â¢ But the living, wakeful moments of
even a metropolitan theater are few
enough and far enough between to allow
much dust to- settle, and the opera-house
at Bakersfield is a grand place for a man
who would withdraw from the world and
think. Love likes to live in the past, and
so it is that some one has laughingly
said Â¦ of the poets â¢ that their feet were
turned backward, their toes pointing out
behind them as though they would stray,
back into times gone by, of which they
write. Thus, too, the lover is never less
alone than when alone, for then he can
in thought be all with her who fills his
mind.
And of the girl herself. , \ ,
Does she write? ' 'â¢' ' '
" Does he write? '
Is she waiting for him all these long
years when he is so far away?
And the misanthrope will ask. is it all
worth the while? The years of privation,
of heart-hunger;, that even wears the body
thin and ages it before its time. Is the
fever worth th3 having? Is it not better
to be a fat, comfortable, well-fed some
body than a lovelorn, listless waiting no
body, shot through again and again each
day by the arrows of the blind archer,
who never has the courage toÂ« kill his vic
tims, but plans' his mercies as did the
kind-hearted surgeon who amputated the
patient's limb an inch at a time. Â¦ .*; ;"-:
Bakersfield which appealed to him, and
there he went.
Left, his lands, left his family, left his j
lady love. Arriving at Bakersfield he be
came acquainted with the proprietor of an
opera-house in course of construction. A
fancy struck him that nothing could bÂ«
more of a change and diversion than Ufa
around the stage. He asked for the posi
tion of watchman that he might always
have the entree of the place, and of all
lonely places for a lorn lover a deserted
theater is the loneliest. A dead tree In a
forest is a wild enough setting for tho
scene of Merlin and Vivien, but a stags
scenery tree, stowed away in the wings,
with the auditorium stretching away la
the darkness dim and vast. Is far mor*
weiri. . 'Â¦'Â¦.â¢>
No owls hoot in the mimic forest, but as
Â¦ the rope hung scenery swings in the winds
that always will pervade a stage the
Â¦tackle gives strange creaks and swishes
that make the eyes bulge and the heart
halt as do children's when the ghost Is
about to appear in a thrilling story. >
Â¦ Under the stage is a room which an
swers well for the hermit's cave, and
here he can muse upon what has been
and wonder what is yet to be. "Waiting 1 ,
waiting for death to steal to Merrle Eng
â¢ land. Waiting for the wires to flash their
message over mountain and under sea to
tell him that a cold, stiff form has been
laid in state in the family chapel and no
longer bars his way to love and fortune.
This: gloomy room beneath the dusty
boards is what he calls homeâ if It is per
missible for a wanderer to call any place
such. His meals he takes where he hap
pens to fancy. At times he lends a hand
with the scene-shifting, and chuckles to
think that If the audience knew what and
who he was tljey would have more eyes
for him than for the well-filled pink tight*
that flit and twinkle before the footlights:

It was about this time that Frederick \V.

stage manager of 'the California in its
earliest history, W.H.'Sedley Smith, and
that of W. H. Smith, the minstrel mana

has been the occasion of considerable con
fusion In the annals of the stage.. W. H.
Sedley Smith was an actor of rare versa T
tlllty, , experience and executive ability,
and a gentleman of the old theatrical
school. It was a sourceof deep annoyance
to this estimable artist to Tie mistaken In

whom, by the way; he' had a warm, friend

It was the custom of the theater-goers
of thirty years ago to take unto them-
There was no necessity for the engage
merit of stars or traveling combinations
with such a large company of competent
people, but the management continued to
present star 'attractions, utilizing as far
as possible the great stock company and
giving expensive productions at all times.
It Is a fact that luring the first two or
three years of its history the California
Theater stock frequently overshadowed
people who brought new- plays â¢ to that
House.. Imagine such players as Oliver
Doud Byron, J. K. Emmett and dthers of
the same caliber suported by artists like
Harry Edwards. John T. Raymond, Wr H.
Sedley Smith, E. J. Buckley and the bal
anco of the old California talent.
The three-hundredth performance at the
California Theater was made the occasion
of a grand Jubilee and the treasurer's
statement up to that time showed total
receipts to the amount. of $278,000.
The Bonfantis, C. R. Thome Jr., Frank
Mayo, the Llngards. the British Blondes,

Frank Wilton, the husband, of the: tal
ented little woman who subsequently be
came a very successful leading lady, was
barnstorming the great ( Northwest with
a company of about seven people, all tora,
and one of his most remunerative stands
was the town of : Astoria. ., He advertised
a brass band, which consisted of a cornet,
a tuba, bass drum and cymbals, and every
member of the company, regardless of
age or sex, appeared on the balcony /out
side of the house while ; the band was
playing, the leading Jady beating the big
drum on occasions^. when/ the;, regular
beater was engaged in looking out for the
fellows who surreptitiously threw "steel
heads" instead of Â» "ChlnooksV Into-' the
barrel. Â¦ > v /
Half a dollar^, whether ' the salmon
weighed five pounds or fifty, was the rate
given at the canneries in checks or tickets
which were. cashed at stated intervals,
and as moneywas scarce, it was the cus
tom for the managers who played Astoria
to have a barrel at the door in which a
fisherman might throw a salmon and In
return receive a ticket of admission. "
The town .had been one of the trading
posts of the great Hudson Bay Company,
as its name suggests, and Its location just
above the great Columbia bar made it a
great salmon fishery as. well. The fisher
men, who," to the number of a thousand or'
more, made Astoria their headquarters at'
that time received pay for their catch by
the month arid salmon .became regular
currency at fifty cents each for the real
article, called "Chinook," but the-"steel
head," now a very desirable fish, '.had a
commercial value of about three cents., :*
There was no Oregon line railroad In tha
early seventies and when the trip to PortÂ»
land, Puget Sound towns and British CÂ«Â».
lumbia was made it was customary to
stop at Astoria for a week or so. ' .
It was during the very first days of tha

at that house, was making her flrst ap

The days of the old Metropolitan were
already numbered, and Maguire' s Opera
house on Washington street was also des
tined to early destruction in order to sat
lÂ«fv the demand for more room and great

of the City Hall, for the erection of which
the Jenny Lind had been torn down al

A project for the opening of Montgom

must move.

D'urinjr the time that the Grand Opera
house scheme was being formulated and
carried to a successful finish the Napo
leonic Maguire had not been idle, but on
the contrary had reached out for further
fields to conquer and was announced as
lessee cf the Bush-street Opera-house in
April, 1875. It is confidently asserted by

The course of the star of theatrical em
pire took its way still southward, ' and a
magnificent theater was built by E. J.
Baldwin as an adjunct to his new hotel
on the block bounded by Market, Powell
Â¦and Ellis streets.
This house was finished In magnificent

west of New "tfork. and there was a stand

that should be pronounced a finer work
of art than the beautiful creation in oil

The Baldwin Academy, which also pass
ed into Maguire' s control soon after its
completion, was opened March 6, 1876, -with.
the celebrated tragedian," Barry. Sullivan,
as the Duke of Gloucester in "Richard

The death of W. C Ralston, the prin
cipal shareholder in the company owning
the California Theater, occurred in Aug
ust, 1ST6, and -was a serious blow to the
prosperity of the new theater.
The dead banker had been the stanch

Lucky Baldwin.

AN ARTTPTCTAU ARTERY MADE WH^ND \% THE
LATEST MARVEWN* SURGERY-
THERE seem* to be no limitations by
which the achievements of science
can be measured, especially in the
domain of surgery. A short time ago
the announcement, was made that at a
Paris hospital a patient had b eeni .nptfUjd

all the purposes of the organ
upon him by nature, and now cornea the
Intelligence that a Russian member of the
proton has succeeded in subsUtutlng
artificial for natural arteries. He has re
paired the great femoral artery: has
Sliced on to ft an artificial length. Just
as a plumber might solder a piece of lead
en pipe to a brass one. ~
The better to â¢ comprehend how radical
E nd difficult a thing Dr. Kaintsky accom
plished It is necessary to explain some
thing of the nature of functions of arte
rlc- In the first place, an artery differs
entirely from a vein. If a vein ia cut the
blood escapes for a while and after a lit
tle the vessel lies flat and collapsed. An
artery does not Its Inner coat is so ar
ranged that a series Â£of stiff fibrous rings

ing. That Is one of the reasons why,
when an artery is severed, blood con
tinues to flow from It.
These were only some of the problems
which confronted Dr. Kaintsky when
they brourht *o his hospital In St. Peters

driving In ' a. sleigh had collided with a

piece of wood struck him Just .below the

inches.
The wound produced was an exceedingly
Ugly and ragged one. It was directly over

supplies the entire leg with blood, but al

*The injured man was not brought to the
hospital until three days after the acci
dent, and It was at once evident that only
heroic measures would save either life or
leg to his patient It appeared to Dr.
Kaintsky that gangrene was threatened.
.As nearly as the surgeon could estimate
he had Just three days before an operation
became absolutely imperative. He had
already determtried^upon the heroic opera
tion, of removing the injured part of the'
â¢femoral artery and replacing it with an
artificial substitute.
Dr. Kaintsky wanted to make a tube six
inches long which should so. closely re
semble the actual tissue of a human ar
tery that It would be borne without pro
teat by the organism in ' which It was 'â¢ to
be placed. At the end of those three days,
tired "but triumphant, he emerged from

sun peeped but. It grew warmer, and
there was a new gurgle and clinking in the
ice-armored brooks. Listlessly the deer
shuffled, up and dotrn the yard. but. the
warmth had. hardly stirred them when the
wind lifted'anew. blowing with a savage
bitterness from the north. At dawn the
Fiiow had crusted, and when the big buck
tried to tread down new "paths, ha cut
Â¦himself 'unmercifully about the hoof3.
With lnllinK tongue he was looking out
along the forest, debating, when a wild
cry â a sharp, querulous hcwling â lifted
above the murmuring of ther wind among
the trees. Oofâ ooo-oooo! Woooâ oofâ ooo!
It "was a dog. Hesdrew himself together
with a shock. Nearer came the sound.
With wild eyes he looked along his trail.
The dog was In the yard. Tt was coming!
Turning on his heel, he fled, and at the
instant the voice of another hound was
added to the clamor.
The buck shot down the open path,
startling the other deer. He dashed among
them, pushing right and left, agonized in
the effort to escape, yet still Intent to lose
his "track among theirs. But at that in
stant a hound appeared In front: there was
a wild babel'of dreadful sounds. He saw
the. dog spring upon. the fawn. -It 'fell,/
struggled madly, and then the hound wor
ried it upon the ground.
Frenzied, the buck turned aside. The
dog was in his path, and one stroke of his
sharpened hoof vould have slain the crea
ture at, its work. But his own precious
me was at risk. He fled, and. unconscious
of the cutting crisst. crashed through the
forest. Bumpâ crashâ bumpâ bump! In

times galloping along the crust, and again
breaking through. The buck was almost
pptnt: the hound drew nearer. Its tongue
hanging from its red and dripping jaws.
At every step it gave tongue till the forest
was filled with the sound.
The buck could go no farther. He turned,
his neck rufiled. a red. ugly gleam in hia
eyes. He was cornered, driven to his last
stride, and must fight. Boo-oof! roared the
hcund. It sprang at his throat, but tha
treccherous crust gave way. and there it
lay at the feet of the buck, wallowing and
defenseless. ' . .
â¢For^an instant there was silence. The
deg, bewildered, lay there, the buck loom
lnc above it. Then the deer lifted both
forefeet together, and with a powerful,
sweeping stroke, beat It down. Again and
again he struck, furious. The snow grew
red beneath' his hoofs, and silently he
kept onâ a wild, remorseless destroyer.
. Before long the huddled bundle of fur be
rcath his feet neither moved, nor made

A man appeared In the brush; He held a
striving hound in leashâ the mate of the

the stamping buck the man shouted, while

At the note the back halted an instant,
staring about, his" awful fear renewed. He
saw the hound break from the leash and
spring toward him. Then, wheeling, he fled
away again. Â¦ "
His only chance was to regain the yard,
to find the tracks of the other deer, and to
turn the dog upon their trail. But as he
circled down the slope, the inexorable

plunged on. bis .tongue out and his eyes

Here is a chance for the American sol

In regard- to looting, the American soldier

than any other soldier present, nor was there
any; reason why he should have fceen. Pos
sibly. he lacked some of the feeling and ar

nationalities, and as a rule he displayed much
determined business capacity. It must bp

looter. â¢Â¦". .
He Is curt and blunt with strangers at first,
but jolly and warm-hearted upon acquaint
ance. He does not particularly : care for ar
tistic* embroiderien. r.or for rare | bronzes and
china ware, nor can he understand. why any
body else does.^ He. will pick up a costly vase
which has been preserved for centuries In the
house 'of a high official, and to 'save htnifelt
the trouble of puttinc.it gently 'down In the
place from which it came ;will drop it on th"
floor. Its companion plece ; at. the . other end
of the sideboard meets a similar fate, the
noise of smashing crockery giving more wild
delight to his unmusical ears than the beau
tiful design, the patient work of years, on the
vase, before it was broken, gave pleasure to
his artistically untrained eye. . The visit of
the -American soldiers had about the. samÂ» re
sult on the interior iof a Chinaman's house as
a severe shock of earthquake. >
The contempt ' of the American soldier for
art has a redeeming point. His dry if some
what coarse sense of humor, his extraordinary
remarks on the things he . touched and saw,
and his composite oaths, In which no nation
in the world . except the Chinese can rival or
equal him.' made him an amusing study. 'His
manner and his language may not always ful
fill the Ideals of European training, but. once
accustomed .to his "bluff." most of which U
assumed . to show his j Indeper.dence, which ; he
thinks he has no other, way of showing, we
shall find him a first-class fellow. - - "-
' From my own observation I can speak high
ly of the American as a soldier. : He generally
Impressed one! '; nevertheless, as' being a person
disappointed in life .and always'. on the look
out for a fortune. When he-talked, money was
his orlly topic, and when he could not talk

â¢urrlng their Batellites to so bravely to the
front under repeatfd assurances of being ab
solutely bullet-proof, the monks themselves
took good care to keep well tn the rear or
â¢under cover. In fact, in most casps they
cleared out of bullet reach until the fight wa<
over. This they explained, "was done, not
from cowardice, but In order to pray for those
â¢who fought for their cause.
At the attack on Tientsin City, nfter vari
ous Incantations and rondry displays of occult
powers, impressive to the . minds j of the Ig
norant and superstitious, these hordes of- fa
natics were let gro against the foreign troops.
â¢ They came running on like madmen, brandish
ing their ewords. some with wild yells, others
chanting the Ih-hwo-Ch'uan war song, the
translation of which is as follows: . '
"Strike toward heaven and its gates will be
opened.

They rushed -wildly forward, but, incanta
tions or no incantations, the bullets of thi
allies went through them all Ihe same. ThÂ«
fact must have caused them some surprise
The machine runs did terrific execution, anc
the Japanese cavalry, dashing to and fro, lcfi
the field covered with dead and wounded. Â¦
It is *aid-lba.t-the rurvivors called the monk;
to account for "the. heavy losses, but the prlesti
had a ready answef.-v,
"It is not our fault**'- J>ai(l . they. "Thosi
men died because' they were" not sufficiently In
ltiated or because they did not "-ha Ye faith Ii
our cause. Those that gave up all Tor the Ih
hwo-Ch'uan came out of the battle wlthou'

mighty, fewâ that had come off the field, scarce
out of their wits, but still alive.
It was not only the foreigners who suf
fered, but the Chinese who had adoptee
the Christian faith were also made th<
-special object cf persecution. The methof
of the Boxer* for picking out a victln
shows how much chance the suspect hat
of clearing himself, when once charged:
In their, hunt for native Christians the Box
. ers ' adopted a singular mo<3Â» of identifyinf
them. "Over the head . of the unfortunate cap
tlve'a magic mirror was held In which & cros

ible in a powerful light, so that the poo
devils arrested on suspicion were , alway
mercilessly pwt to death. . .
Mr. Landor its - absolutely, frank " In hi
criticism of the various officials. He i
himself an Englishman;- but that in n<
â¢way interferes with his candid expressloi
of oplnlonspf the acts of Sir Claude Mac
donald. He blames that gentleman f o
the unfortunate ; Brooks affairâ the .- firs
missionary : to lose his life. His criticise
, shows that the British Minister when in
. vestlgatlng the affair was so pleased a
having received a visit from the minister
of the Tsung-H-Tamen' and other high ol
-flciaJs that he accepted wholesale the 1 fin
sromlses and Â¦ assurances oÂ£ the Chinese
Another mistake he points out Is ti ~
short-sightedness of Sir Claude . in .. not
seeing long before he did that the Chinese
"Government was in perfect . sympathy
with the Boxer movement.:
Mr. Landor sounds a note of warning In
this connection that Is worth some
thought: ' â¢
In the' Imperial palaceâ although Sir Claude
reported to the contraryâ there existed, /even
before that time, not fear of but encouragement
and friendlineps tmviÂ»rd the Boxers, the. Em
press Dowager, with Prince Tuan and a number
of foreijrn-hatingr Mnnchu princes, believing
firmly that the moment had come when the Chi
nes? could at last either kill or drive, Into the sea
â¢very foreign devil. It must ever be borne In
mind that this notion: is. and always will be
firmly rocted In every Chinese mind. The
hlcW he is in official position the deeper is
his feeling of contempt and. hatred for foreign-'
ers. On<? hears reports that tne Chinese admire
our civilization: that he Is in amazement at our
Inventions; that he will one day be as civilized
as we are : that Is to say when he has learned
enoug-h. And so the Chinese will be. He will
strive to purchase- machinery, guns and, am
munition: hp trill gradually learn how to work
thrra. and when he do*s he "will do it well; but
this will rnly be In ordÂ»r to learn how to fight
xjf. and '. to have hlK revenue for what he con
riders, probably with justice, as our offenses.
He will never rest content until, no matter at
what erst to his nation 'In. human life. In
money, suffering: pnd humiliation: no matter
Â¦p-hat blows may have been : dealt him, he can
one day stand .up fiercer than ever and strike
bark a harder blow at us than any he has re
ceived. . * '
The account of the Seymour expedition,
the taking of the Taku forts and the final
capture of the native settlement In Tien

are a valuable addition to the text. Many
of them ere grewsome. but the Chinese
in warfare mate it even worse than what
Fhprman had to F.i.y about -war. and the
photographs of tortured bodiP3 show the
truth where mere words might be taken
as too strorsr s> t^uoh of Imagination.
On June 10 at 0:30 a. m. Vice Admiral
F.Ir Edward Seymour and his expedition
of 2-^CO men left Tientsin for the relief ol
Pfkinpr. only to R^t as far as Lanfang
r''ir Pjrhtirp their way -against great
odds, and finally:
T'naW? to keep open thp communication: run

rrÂ»-bjÂ»b;llty of b~lre cut offâ It was <1ec'd"d thot,
in the circumrtances. It would be wiser for thÂ«
cxreditlon to return to Tifntrln.
He thus describes the first skirmish be
tween the Boxers and the allied troops:
I-ate In the afternocn. at about 6. the trait
f topped and thÂ» alarm was riven that the en
riry v.Ts apnreachirc Major Johnstone and si>
rrarin^s, followed by Midshipman Davids anc
fn marines, were marchini? some distanc<
ahead of the train along the line to examine Its
cr-ndition. rchfn a b"dy of Doxers w<Â»s noticed
leaving the villaee. In ordor, apparently, to eul
their, off fiâ m the trsOn. . Retreating in due
ha=te towp.rd the main body, of the force' thÂ«
sn-all party kept up a funning, fizht'wiih thÂ«
one<.-ny. Â¦ When only a few hundred yards frorr
- t>*e train the "bluejackets poured : a jinf fire frorr
the railway embankment Into th*. Boxers and
drove ihom toward tke maln^ British -force. T"b(
c.CTny wÂ«p then exposed to a ~sÂ»verecross'-flrÂ»
frcm thÂ» Maxims and rifles "of the Centurion'i
men. 'The marines had alighted , from - th<
trucks to rerel the attack of this horde of fa
ratlcs. who ran close under the. runs, . waving
their swords, pitchforks and clubs. As the>
actually came within^ a ranse of two or threÂ«
hundred ysrds their red turbans and sashes
could plainly be seen, showing that they were
Boxers, and not regular troops. They car
ried no firearms to speak of, except old
fashioned matchlocks. Some of. the enemy
Â¦n-cre mounted, but the majority were or
foot, young- boys, apparently in a state of hys
terical .frenzy., running wildly In front of thÂ«
mad crowd. Their number In all was esti
mated at close upon 1500. -fTiey showed as
tounding bravery, dashiner upon the British and
exposing themselves with bare chests to thÂ«
bullets of forelsrn rifles.
For an hour the fusillade was kept" upâ or
one side only â with Maxims and rifles. tvhlW
these fanatics darned to the, attack time aftei
time with. their primitive weapons. They. wen
repulsed and were believed to have suffered
heavily.
\ â¢ It these Chinamen could fight like that
with clubs and pitchforks against modern
, rifles. It is easy to be Imagined .what
. would have happened to the. Seymour ex
Â» peditlon if the Boxers' had had military
- training and up-to-date arms. Mr.'Lan
t dor's suggestion given above regarding
r civilization and the. Chinese is really
T worth- careful consideration. Here is the

wife, has had the exclusive . care of his

5 â¢ The Cross Roads of Destiny.
"The Crossroads of Destiny," by John
P.. Eltter, :Â¦ Is- an exciting romance of love
and adventure In the fifteenth century. Â¦.
The scene is laid in .Venice when that
powerful republic was In the zenith of Us ,
power. _ Prince Angelo of Frescla is In
love with the Donna Beatrice Pilano. the
only daughter cf.S!gnor;Anafesto Pilano.
a.Venetlan Senator. Â¦" The girl returns hte
affection, but her father plans to marry
her to the . aged Christoforo Donato. his .
associate In tlÂ»e Venetian Senate. In her
despair' she sends word to her lover to
hasten to her rescue. For various state
reasons Prince Angelo Is; prevented ' from_
going to hera'd in person, so he sends
his friend j Barnabas, a gallant young-
English knight, upon the mission.
Barnabas reaches Venice In the disguise
of an English Baron traveling about the
world in the pursuit of sight-seeing and
'pleasure. He establishes himself in a pal
ace and enters upon a life! of luxurious
prodigality, in -he course of which he ac
cidentally meets a Venetian beauty with
whom he falls- passionately in love. Later
he discovers that the object of his adora
tion is none other than the Donna Beat
rice Pilano, whom Prince Angelo has sent
himÂ«tforth to rescue. " ;
A' series of thrilling and intensely dra
matic chapters â¢ follow. In which the
â¢author vividly, describes the rescue of tne
Donna Beatrice by the English knight in
the face of deadly perils and the gradual
development of a new passion In the heart
"of the Venet'an damselâ namely, an ar
dent! love, for her -fescuer. This part of
the.. narrative is replete with sentiment
of rare sweetness and delicacy, abounds
in descriptive passages full of life and
color and is irrbued with the spirit and
charm of genuine romance:
Barnabas and Donna Beatrice declare
their love for one another; then the voice
nf honor calls them back to duty. Both
heroically resolve to. keep faith with
Prince Anselo. but on their arrival at his
castle an. unexpected event happens which
frejss them from this obligation. "With
this event, the story ends happilyâ as all
pood stor'es should end. (Published by

, I Ths Little Crusaders.
A story of interest to youthful readers
has been writien by Isabel Scott Stone,
and called "The Little Crusaders." As
the name implies, it is a tale of that re
markable aftermath of the Knights' Cru
sade, which in the" thirteenth century
despoiled so roanv homes of children, and
rent. them toward. the Holy Land, only to
meet at last Oeath or captivity.
The story. Is not one. for very young
children, but for those who have begun
to be interested In the remarkable events
told in history, it is well worth reading.
The. main theme of the book is the career
of a young girl who. joins the band of
children as It sets out to rescue the Holy
Sepulcher. Her. fate Is* more fortunate
thanVthat. of almost all the others; for
she returns In safety to the home 'of her
father.^ ,"Â¦-..â¢ '] 'Â¦:Â¦ Â¦":. ' /
The story^of the fortunes of the hero
ine ' Is enlivened- by the introduction of
some of the important characters who
played a part in the Crusades, and by de
; seriptlons ;' of .Important places through
which the. little, crusaders passed on their
ill-starred 'expedition. (Published by the

The Luck of a Highland Laddie.
"The Luck of a Highland Laddie." by
May Crommelin. Is a bright, slap-dash,
pretty and â¢ thoroughly readable love
story. The hero owes his. luck to the fact
of his being the seventh son of a seventh
son. and every seven years some stroke
of fortune Increases his happiness. His
life is sketched. prettily from the moment
of his birth. Of course. 'he is poor and,
of course, he has a charming girl sweet
heartâand what would a story like this
be If with the same Inevitableness he did
not find a will bequeathing to him vast,
estate?? Then the will is stolen, and Jock
(that is the lucky boy's name) goes out
to Peru to work for .Elsie and inciden
tally to have a nice exciting time, and a
naughty person tells her he is dead. And,
of- course, he comes hack and everything
ends very happily.. To discuss the style
and other literary qualities from a crit
ical point of view would be like discuss
ing the architecture of a doll's house. It
is a simple,, wholesome story suited to
the feminine folk for whom It was writ
ten. (Published by F, M. Buckles & Co.,

devoted to a careful history of the be
liefs, customs and legends connected with
buildings, locations and landmarks and a
detailed account of the various ceremo
nies* at foundations from the earliest
times to the present day. The evolution
of these ceremonies makes a very Inter
esting study. At first they were marked
by human sacrifices, then by the slaugh
ter of animals and later by the substitu
tion of vegetable products. The chapters
on relics, images, symbols and writings
will also appeal to the student of such
matters. (Published by The Abbey Press

A Birthday Book.
Zoe Proctor has gathered selections
from the writings of John Oliver Hoboes,
(Mrs. Cralgle), and has made of them a
birthday book. The result is not entirely
satisfactory. Mrs. Cralgle is undoubtedly
clever, but with a cleverness that 13
startling rather than attractive. Her in
geniously: worded epigrams are usually of
cynical tone. Coming In the course of a
story, as observations upon particular
people, or use 1 in definite connection
with longer explanations, they are amus
ing enough. They do not, however, lend
themselves happily to the uses of quota
tions when occurring in quick succession
apart from their context.
Still, an enthusiastic admirer of Mrs.
Cralgle' s work can find In this birthday
book a plenitude of witty sayings. (Pub

If a curious title can attract the atten
tion of the public, "Anting- Anting
Stories," just announced by Small, May
nard & Co.. should be sure of success.
The volume takes Its name from a Fili
pino word signifying a charm, or amulet,
worn to protect its owner from injury or
death; and the sub-title of the book ex
plains that it is a collection. at. "Strange
Tales of the Filipinos." . Its author Is
Sargent Kayme. a new name in literature,
.but- the name of one who seems to have
had rare opportunities for studying the
life of the . inhabitants of 'our new pos
sessions.
There is untold wealth of new material
for literature in these far-away Eastern
islands, and it will not be surprising' if
these stories prove to bp the introduction
to a hew field no less fresh and original
than was the India of Mr. Kipling's
stories.
"Wonderful and varied are the phenom
ena and the inhabitants of the Philip
pines. Pirates, half-naked natives, pearls,
man-apes, towering Volcanoes about
whose summits clouds and unearthly tra
ditions float together, strange animals
and birds, and stranger men. pythons,
bejuco ropes stained with human blood,
feathering palm trees now fanned by soft
breezes and now crushed to the ground by
tornadoesâon no mimic stage was ever
a . more wonderful scene set for such a.
company of actors. That such stories as
Mr. Kayme gives us do not exaggerate
the realities of this strange, life can be
easily seen by any one who has read the
letters from press correspondente, our sol
diers or the more formal books of travel.
Strangest, perhaps, of all these possi
bilities for fiction is the anting-anting. at
once a mysterious power to protect its
possessor and the outward symbol of the
protection. No more curious fetich can
be found in the history of folklore. A
button, a coin, a bit of paper with unin
telligible words scribbled upon It, a bone,
a stone, a garment, anything, almostâ
often a thing of no intrinsic valueâ its
owner has been known to walk up to the
muzzle of a loaded musket or rush upon
the point of a bayonet with a confidence
so sublime as to silence ridicule and to
command admiration^ if not respect.

and arabesques cut from the .leather,
which is brilliantly illuminated in reds,
blues and greens, and overlaid and inlaid
with gold and silver leaf. The effect- Is
that of jewels in a rich setting, and the
treatment is that given by the leather
workers of Cordova, in old Spa'n. several

An over-mantel leather panel on the

the spears, the horses', heads and flying
manes, stand boldly out, and, like the rls-^

frieze, was done by two California wom

A noticeable fault to the. American
woman is the utter Â¦ absence of 'rocking
chairs. The Russians, who are said ,to
enjoy most fully the luxuries of. life, and
to remain indifferent to what we consider
the necessities, do not. evidently, consider
the dainty bed chamber as an essential
part of an establishment. The woes of ali
American woman who has rented a fur
nished house in St. Petersburg have been
related, and I think one of the hardest
things she had 'to endure was to find that
in a palace of a-ljouse where magnificent
paintings and superb Oriental rugs adorn
ed the walls of the salon, there was not
ore inhabitable bedroom., that the former
occupants had binpn In the habit; of sleep

contrast to this poverty of comfort and
noauty I will deFcribe jone of the airiest
and daintiest bedrooms that. -It .has ever
been * my fortune to see. , It is* pcarcely
necesrary to add that it forms part of an
American home.

The endeavor to subordinate . the vivid
green of the billiard table, which Is a
feature of this room, has resulted in . a
thoughtful shading and mingling of rich
tones which makes the room fairly pal
pitate with color and - yet lends It the
eoftened charm of an old Persian ruff.
The peculiar coloring of the curtains
adds much to the charm of the room and
Is evidence of artistic feeling In .the dec
orator. It is as beautiful as It Is unus
ual. A grayish figured net Is used in full,
straight scarfs against the glass and over
this Is hung mouse-colored velourâ a
mouse color shot -with a i yellow lightâ
lined -with gold colored satin.>The tender
suggestion of gray melts charmingly into
the yellow and serves thoroughly to bring
out the reddish tones of the mahogany.
Thus, although the room Is exception
ally long and rather heavily furnished
with much mahogany, has dark polished
floors and a profusion of rich, dark Turk
ish rugs. It Is, owing to the disposition of
its windows and the perfect harmony of
glowing colors used in Its . decoration,
beautifully lighted and cheerfulto a de
gree.
The walls are covered with a "Morris"
paper of pumpkin yellow, unglazed, with
Irregular arabesques in velvety brown
scattered over It. The celling, finished in
rough plaster and heavily beamed, 'is
toned a deep, plain yellow; the woodwork
is old mahogany finish. â¢
The living room Is forty feet long and
Is finished at one end with an Immense
rounded bay window. An alcoved recess
oti the south side Is all of glass and holds
the tea. table and Its adjuncts. Three
windows run across the front or east side
and eliding doors are the excuse for
a wide arch into thÂ« reception room at
this end.

To proceed with my description. There
are effects in this house which will have
almost a startling novelty to some minds.

I amine a luxurious and most artistic
j ally conceived home, and, as I felt
JL that tbe taste displayed in its furnish
ing and decoration would be an in
spiration to others, I requested that I
might be allowed to describe it in det.iil
to rny readers. There are many people
â¢who have the money with which to buy
a beautiful home, but as they have natu
rally never made a study of effects in
housentting and furnishing they can
only phice themselves helplessly in the
hands of the professional deeorater. Alas,
the decorator's ideas may be utterly at
variance with lhe owner's Individual con
ception of what the interior of his house
should be. and the result is that he pays
for what he does not want. The decorator
possibly has worked for such and such a
successful firm for a number of years. Hi
has always trimmed his silken window
draperies with little tasseled fringes,
therefore he will continue so to trim
them. He has always hung: these draper
ies with a stiff interlining which lakes
all softness and natural fall from the
drapery, and shrugs his shoulders at the
ridiculous suggestion that the stuff should

tions can afford to dispense with the ex

Fhe will in this way throw off the stiffness
Â¦uhich envelops like a pall many hand-
FOTPelv furnished rooms. If artists would
lend themselves to this work of benutjfy-
Jrp interiors, as Raphael and Michael
"Angelo' did with their cartoons for tapes
tries and their mural paintings, ah. then
we would have homes to charm the eye
and the senses. But men of genius who
have made a life study of the effects of
lights and shades, of backgrounds, of the
necessary prominence of certain shapes
to give character to an arrangement can
not afford to expend themselves on house
decorations. However, we can profit by
what they teach us. A woman who is
beautifying her home can make a study
for herself of these things and she will
feel amply repaid for her work by the
'beauty she will create around her. Tho
woman who really means to have an artis
tic home will not permit the folds of her
Â¦window draperies to be festooned with
mathematical precision in exact Imitation
of the time-honored drapery on hearses.
Finicky, little tasseled fringes will grate
on her nerves, and although most of the
drapery In the conservative, elegant, old
homes of her friends Is so decorated, she
will have none of them. She will not
think of having knotted rope portieres
suggest In her rooms a sleeping or a parlor
car, but ehe will shake off all tradition
and work things out on artistic lines for
herself.

An anonymous admirer once sent a for
mer President of thÂ« French republic a
somewhat curious Easter egg. It wa3 de
livered carefully packed, and being
marked "private" the package was
opened, by the President himself.
But an ominous sound of ticking inside
conjured up visions of infernal machines,
and as speedily as possible the alarming
package was placed. Just as it was, in a
bucket full of water. After: it had re
mained submerged for some time it was
taken in hand by an expert of the Police
Department. On proceeding to . open the
egg this official found inside it nothing In
the nature of an explosive, but a very
handsome gold watch.
Several. years ago a New York lady re
ceived through the post a beautiful choco
late, Easter egg. She was actually golnc
to eat It when her, sweetheart,- a young
doctor, was announced.. She showed him
the egg and inquired if he had sent it
which he denied. Not liking the look of
the egg he asked to be allowed to take
it away with him. A few houra later he
returned with the startling . information
that it contained sufficient poison to kill
half a dozen people! ' â¢ â¢ ' Â¦. â¢ Â¦
An Easter egg. of a very different type

Skill and judgment are called for In the
selection of some of the new and freakish
shades. The easiest made is the chimney
pot shape and it is still very much ad
mired. A conventional pattern Is painted
on it and gives a charming effect. It
doesn't eternally remind one of hours of
toil with a ; needle, silk and patience. \
And that Is reminf,pcent\ of something
else. Half the dainty lamps are painted
china with globes that match to a nicety
in design and color. . They I are built in
all kinds of shapes". They -scoop in here
and bulge out there; some are stout and
others can hardly, hold themselves up
but. all manage to give the soft; mellow .
This year the rose petal shades are as
big as a good-sized balloon, and aro ever
so much prettier than the old styled um
brella shapes of a few years ago. V "Â¦
A shade made of overlapping- rows of
stlken petals is most lively in rooms fur
nished in pale colors. One of yellow goes
In a room done up In creamy tints with
now. and then a touch, of crimson and
green, and another of rose color should be
in a reception-rom fitted up af ter . the
Louis Â¦ Qainze period.
And then there are out and out freak
shari<?s that make novelty hunters go into
raptures. The leather ones over colored
silk are the prettiest, and don't attract
quite so much attention as the hat or the
tinted cardboards. Only undressed kid Is
used, and the most popular shades are a
Havana brown and gray, although all
suede colors are used more or less. A

swinging lanterns that come In wrought

places.
chrysanthemums In a dozen different
shades, figures and heads and even pro
cessions.
The lamps which hold these queer look
ing shades are all tall and graceful and a
collection looks very much Ilka a garden
party. Nobody looking at them would
be the least bit surprised to see them all
begin to bow amiably at nothing and no
body In particular.
But the funniest looking of all are the
hat shades. When one gets over the sur
prise at seeing a garden hat topping off
a lamp, the spinal column suddenly gets
weak, for they are the worst kind of fire
traps. . They are made in various styles,
but yellow and red are the' nobbiest- A

brim, rivals a white straw with pink

but keeps one guessing as to its safety.
Silk shades are always more beautiful
and far more graceful than .any metal,
porcelain or painted cardboard that can
be imagined.
One of the prettiest lamps of the season
Is a queer shaped metal bowl held in place
by sealion heads. The- shade is a pink
with a Roman procession marching along
In a soft yellow. Another fancy metal
bowl possesses a lily globe. ! The two
colors are a soft red for a background and
a very light pink flower. When' that com
bination of colors Is pretty, it Is very
pretty, and in a globe it sheds a rosy,
cheerful light.
The Tiffany glass shades are dreams of
iridescent colors. On account of the price
they often remain dreams, too. "Fortu
nately they are heavy enough to stand
rather rough handling, and their numer
ous colors blend beautifully v/ith any'
room. globes set with great piece?

though they are apt to suggest a cathedral

Women have discovered that nothing
makes a room fo attractive as a stunning
lamp shadeâ unless it Is half a dozen lamp
shades. That's the reason why the dis
carded lamp has come into popularity
again.
The woman who is wise always selects
a faintly colored shade for her boudoir.
The light, filtered through delicate tints,
gives a wonderful charm %o the complex
ion. More time is being devoted to colors
nowadays, as It means so much.
There are lamps and lamps. The con
servatory lamp and the shade are an in
stitution in themselves. Then there is the
drawing-room lamp, which is covered, and
the library lamp with its green shade.
There are hall lamps and lamps for dens
and lamps for reception-rooms, and, in
fact, lamps for every conceivable corner
of the house.
The shades are as numerous and as
handsome as the lamps. Any woman who
has only a plain porcelain shade can dress
It up in such a fashion that it will - not
remind everybody of the ark. One can
buy a dingle-dangle metal fringe and slip
It over the plain pink, green or white and
hardly recognize the underneath. The
newest lamps, made of Damascus candle
sticks or of beaten brass, have shades of
metal lined with various colored muslin.

THE SUNDAY CALL. ;
D^r^r^
T HIS Is the period of the spring veg
etable, and few persons realize how
much the delights of the season may
be increased by additional care in
the preparation of those -foods, which are
never quite so good as they are just at
this period. Possibly: the peas nowin the
market have >. greater delicacy of taste
than any other springtime product, and
they are. at least regarded along with the
spring lamb as the "gastronomic symbo) of
the early summer months.
The French, who are proverbially cap
able of adding a delicate foreign) taste to
vegetables without' destroying, their; own
flavor, cook peas in a v manner that has,
never been generally, adopted here." The'
average American housewife would shu4-
der at the thought of combining onions
with the savory peas, but the
Franch cooks do~ that,' and the : result is
better than the American Â¦. prejudiced
against the onion, in- nearly, every form
would care to admit. .. This /process ..{; of
cooking peas combines also "with the onion
th e outside leaves of a head of lettuce.
The peas are inclosed- in 'these, and into
the center of them is put one small spring
oniony when they, are served :th,e .com
bined flavor of the .lettuce and the onion
asserts itself but in no way
destroys the natural taste of the peas.
That flavor seems, indeed, to be .â¢empha
sized by the combination with the other
vegetables.^^^^^^^^|^^^^^^t;

"She was beautiful!"
"Not in repose," said Belarco. radiant
in the vision of her remembered presence. â¢
Then he said suddenly: "And look at Sir
Henry Irvingâ eccentric, almost awk

bears out the promise of all those ewlft
subtleties of expression that I have Been
in the faces of great emotional actresses,
Â¦without any direct resemblance to any

While there is the predominant stamp
of tenderness in his face, there is also the

f;irerr\r-?t excellence of theatrical- art: but
of h;s imirr.nt** perrcnaMtr. of the mherent
qualities in the man. of his actual artistic
resources, little, if anythirg, is known by
the general public.
His innate spns'tivness toward any
intnnate approach of the strarsser and his
abstraction of all things not imirediat^'y
bearing upon the work in hand have mad-;
him all but inaccessible to the Interviewer.
He darts into the theater where a play
of his may be running with the manner of
a man who Is being pursued, and before
any one can buttonhole him he vanishes
through a secret door leading to a mana
jrerial sanctum and is immediately sur
rounded by his henchmen.
His guardian. "Ben" Roeder. Is ever on
the alert to throw the curious off the
scent, knowing Belasco's extreme sensi
tiveness. There are some people who at
tempt to explain this peculiarity In vari
ous -ways. agreeably and other-wise, but it
is as rr.ueh an instinct of his nature, ami
quite as uncontrollable, as his ehort. rapM
palt along 1 the street or his Indifference to

He leaned his head on his hand and de
scribed how the subtleties of human na
ture receive the touch of life on the stage.
"There are changing Â¦ expressions of
emotion that occur differently under dif
ferent circumstances," he said, slowly.
"For instance. If a man receives news
of the loss of his mother, how will he ex
press it? Is he a stoic, a tender nature,
an emotional nature? "Will he receive the
news with tears or with rigid lines of pain
In his face? Or. he has lost hia wife â
there will be a difference in expression
according to the. relationship. A sweet
heart will express the loss of the man she
loves more poignantly than if he were her
husband and they had been married
awhile." : .'K*'?~'i '-"..'Â¦
"And how have_ you gathered accuracy
In these sacred emotions?" I asked.
"I have watched and followed, and
squeezed my way in at solemn moments
in the lives of men and women."
"For the sake of art?"
"Because I have an Insatiable curiosity,
a profound sympathy with life. life, life!"
he said, looking fixedly at me, his hand
buried in his hair, his head bowed low In
a pose of concentrated purpose.
There is a deep significance In the pro
cess, when it is freely told, of artistic
expression,.
. To the layman it has the significance of
the tremendous possibilities of human en
joyment in the hidden springs of his own
nature.
To the artist it has the greater signifi
cance of professional ambition, for it
stimulates and reawakens the deep mur

Proper Care of
Corns
ffJT ARD corns are produced by friction
|n~jl and pressure. Very-loosa footgear
'.- ** may be more hurtful than tight.
The boot should perfectly fit thÂ«
foot. The best way to gtt rid of a h_nj
corn <Â« to pi* â¬ Â« over it a shield and to at
tack the growth with salicylic acid collo
dion. After some few applications thÂ»
outer layers will be easily removable. By
perseverance the corn will be , brought
even with the skin surface. If .now thÂ«
part is completely protected from pressure
and friction, the deeper, "down srowins"
center .will gradually disappear, partly by
absorption and partly by beins pushed tÂ»
*he surface. The acid should be used now
and azain until where the corn once waj
there is a smooth new skin.
Â¦ Soft corns always arises from pressnrÂ»
and moisture. -The feet when carefully
tended never develop these painful
growths. When undertaking treatment,
the first essential is to wipe the feet thor
oughly after they have been wet. If the
parts "are moist naturally, they ought to
be wiped at least twice daily. After doir.?
so an absorbent and soothing powder
should be applied freely. Starch and bo
racic acid in equal parts will be found
useful. At night do not applythe powder,
but instead lay on with a brush equal
parts of salicycllc acid collodion and fluid
hydrochlcrate of. morphia.
This plan will suffice, but another that
has proved very successful is as follows:
At night the parts are thoroughly dried.
Then this mixfure is laid on with a brush:
saturated solution, of alum, one dram.
This/will dry and harden the sodden tis
sue. Apply for six nights. On the seventh
use the salicylic and morphia. If the corn
is^.between the toes, wadding should be
placed inthat situation. *
The agony that may be caused by a nets
lected soft corn is altogether out of pro
portion to the apparent cause of the pain.
Brief pain can be borne with a smile, but
when it is ' bound to 'affect the
' facial expression of even the most stoical.

Probably -the least offÂ«"7Â»stve' and disfigur
ing of all skin blemishes, they are the
most obstinate to remove. Dermatolo
gists hav* tried in vain to compound a
remedy which ' ' should be ' a permanent
cure.- It has yet to be found. True, they
may be faded, even removed In many
cases, after persistent treatment; but,
with the' advent of the -warm spring days
and summer winds," they "are very apt to
reappear. The summer girl, inclined to
freckle, â¢ who yet justly refuses to be
housed ; when sun, sky and sea woo her,
has on hand a perpetual problem. \ :'
Freckles are divided Into two classes :
cold or constitutional freckles, and sum
mer or light freckles. The latter fade
gradually, or yield, for.a time, at least to
mild lotions: The former require almost
heroic treatment, which then frequently
brings disappointment. It is impossible
truthfully to;. 'J guarantee" a freckle cure
The very situation .of the freckle^below
the surfaces-offers an obstacle. One dif
ficulty in the way of their removal lies In
the wide^ difference in the texture of dif
ferent skins. freckle lotion that -will
have no effect upon one's complexion will
irritate and . blister, that of another

many freckle lotions â¢ is . add. An a6id

Preparing Cuts
of Meat
THE neck, skin, shank and legs are
used for soup stock. The ' brisket
makes an economical boil, .being in
terlarded with fat; it is also used for
corned beef. The cross rib is mostly used
for pot roast."
The fore-quarter' of beef has thirteen
ribs. These are divided into chuck and
prime ribs. The. chuck ribs, of which
there are seven, beginning" . where the
neck ends, are used for chuck steaks,
stews, roast or goulash. The six prime
ribs are used for rJast beef. These, are
divided into three partsâ first, second and
third cut; the first and second cut are the
best. The plate cut from the end of the
ribs Is generally "about eight or nine
inches wideband Is best for corned meat;
it is also used for boiling. /The navel may
also be used for stews or' soups.
From the short loin five different kinds
of steaks are cut, beginning where ; the
prime ribs end. . First'cbme the,Delmon
ico, which have no tenderloin; next:. to
these come the porterhouse, which have
tenderloin; then come the sirloin steaks,
which have a flat bone and a tenderloin;
next to these come .the hip steaks, which
have a tenderloin and an . oval-shaped
bone; next to these is the round bone
steak. The fillet is the tenderloin found
in the inside of the short loin, in the hol
low formed under the spinal bone; this
is considered the choicest part of '.Â¦ the
whole animal. .The fillet: is "cut" from the
epinal cord. by following the bone' with a,
knife; the fillet is then freed from all fat,
nerves and thin skins covering the" meat-
It is either larded and roasted, or- cut in
slices and broiled . for . beefsteak,, or it
may be prepared in a number, of ways.
i The rump of beef commences where the
loin ends. This piece of meat Is. excel
lent.for broiling, < braising or corning. The,
ox tail is used for stews and soups. , The
round and , bottom round^ are. usld for
'steaks, chopped beef and beef tea. -The
butt sirloin, also called ;,the';. upper arid
lower, sirloin, is used for beef a la mode,
braised beer, sauer roast and pot roastâ Â¦

OICE of the most trying seasons in
the culinary department is hereâ a
-time when the smallest detail of a
' â¢ dinner demands attention and
when all things taste so much alike. It's
because things are here and yet not here.
Certain vegetables and fruits are going
out. Only the old unsatisfactory is left.
To be sure new ones are coming in tc
take their places, but the season hasn't
yet advanced its best products. The lat
est delicacies may be very tempting t*
look at, but not prove very appetizing/
And they're , expensive as well. One
could cheerfully stand that part of it if
the palate was very much tickled, but
when the dish is a miserable failure, then
the cook is in despair. ; Â¦'.: .';.:"

ENTREES AND

OVER THE TELEPHONE
"Did you ever hear of gambling by tele
phone?" asked a sporting man at an up-'
town hotel the other night. "The inven
tor so far as I know was a German com
edian who may be called Dick. "About
six months ago Dfck was acting in Roch
ester. He Is fond of gambling and his
favorite pastime Is faro. One night after
the show he asked a friend if there were,
any games open in. the town. The friend
declared that every game was closed us
far as he knew.' Then Dick,, turning to
one of his companions, said:
"'Jack, I feel lucky to-night and I'd
like to get a bet down some way or other.
This town is slow, and without some ox
cltement life is not worth livinp. I want
to play faro.'
" 'But what are you golng'to do?' aslced
his friend: 'All the joints are closed and
I don't know of any place where we could
Invest any. money.' ;
"Dick pondered a' moment. , Abruptly
as If struck by an idea he said:
" 'I've got it, Jack. I'm going to bet if
I have to lose a leg doins so.'
"Jack was puzzled but said nothing.
" 'Where is the telephone?' said Dick
excitedly. 'I'm going to 'phone to a New
-t_ â¢ Â¦
York house where a game 13 in session at
this very moment.'.;. \. ;
"Saying this he left the room and went
to'the 'phone. The instrument was of the
automatic kind and first dropping $1 7> in
the s!ot Dick called up aweli known
New York gambling housp. 'In a few min
utes Dick got a reply. Then. the follow
ing conversation took place: - '
*; 'Dickâ Is" this Mr. Blank?'
" 'Voice â No,- It's the colored stpward.'
" "Dickâ Call. Mr. Blank. Tell him- I'm
Dick â , and that I want to talk to him.'
"In a few seconds Mr. Blank came to the
'phone and Dick- continued :' : "How"d'ye
do; My. Blank? . This is Dick. ' Â¦. I'm in
Rochester. Is there a game going on to
night?'
"'.Voiceâ Yes.* ; . ; - r f
. .".'Dick â Well as soon as you come to
the last turn let me know.'
"Dick, when : in , New York always-pnt
ronized . the game and was considered .'a
good customer and could always have a
marker for any amount. j
." 'Mr. Blankâ The last turn is on.
I've told-the dealer to wait for you/ â¢
V" 'Dickâ What is it?'
" 'Mr. Blankâ The nine, the Trey, and
the six.'

win; $50 on the -nine coppered; S50 on the
high card and $50. to call the turn.'

friends what he had done and it was hard
to make them believe what he said was
the truth. When he came to New. York
again he convinced them that he was
not joshing and treated all hands to sev

the gambling house the proprietor handed
him $350 in bills and, of course, Dick blew

"Dick says that the experlencey of
pambllns by wire, is a novel one, but
thinks the scheme rather precarious. It
convinced him of one thing and that was.
that there are some : honest ramblers in
this world.- Suppose Mr. Blank had told
him' he had lost?: He had nothing: 'but

A HOUSE and A Fat Pig we:it
on a long journey.
"Stick Close to Me, Little
Man!" said the Pig. "I am Large and
Fat and my Voice Soundeth Terrible.
None will dare to Tackle Me!"
So they traveled together a Lon^
Way. and saw many Strange Sights.
WHAT single person ever saw a
child misbehave that he or she
&X6. not immediately become pos-
Fess<>d of a stronc desire to ad
minister rebuke, both to the
parent and the child? Who has not seen
chMdren misbehave In public and mothers
try in vain to pacify a young disreputable,
aid who in such case* did not make or
hear remarks such a?: "If tha^were my
child I should whip it right here at the
time, and impress so indelibly on that
.child's mind that it must never do so
2 gain that there w.ould never bÂ« a' repe
tition of such performances." etc., etc, ad
irfinitum..
Most people have some similar comment
to make.
When occasionally some, mother, feeling
the futility of useless^ "there, darling,
fion't" etc., etc., gives a child a spanking
In public, the beholders are horrified;
shocked beyond utterance at the vulgarity
of the mother, at her utter disregard for
an audience or the public. highway for the
administering: of corporal punishment.
In fact, "coriwral punishment is a relic
of barbarism, and the mother should be
well beaten herself." . ,'*; .-*/â¢.
This and much more to the same effect
roes the rounds, and every .beholder,
either of the lenient mother, who tries- to
pacify her child for the benefit of the
public peace, cr she who chastises It pub
licly for the edification of the crowd,
meets with its disapproval;, for every wit
ness, either to the pacifying and concilia
tory regime or the rash and pugilistic ad
ministration, thinks he or sheâ usually
the latterâ could give that mother cards
and spades and beat her; give* her point-
ers of Inestimable value to her In . the
training and rearing of her degenerate
offspring. ' /'.',...
The theoretical child is always un
selfish, bo thoughtful â¢ and considerate.
The theoretical child does not care for
BTiant Etories or tales of adventure; It
though this was theorizing too: it lacks
the ring of the genuine article; that "gen- !
tleness. yet firmness," reminds her of her
visionary youth, but she listens with in
terest.
j. The Women's Congress meets.
Mamnta notices papers .are to be read
on the training of children.
- She is willing, nay, anxious to learn: her
pride is laid in. the dust; her theoretical
childrenhave died natural deaths and are
burjed 'neath flowers ]pns' since withered.
But the. practical side, the animated ac
tion, perpetual little Keely motor ma
chines, are painfully^ in evidence.
She goes to the Women's -Congress.
Here she will hear some learned and ex
perienced woman discourse on the train
ing' of children. Â¦ > ;ââ¢ V,4/
Here will be given her a' compass by
which to stÂ»cr.
She glances'at her programme.
Miss Knowitall on '.'The Training of
Children." Miss, she gasps] She listens
to the long and tedious (to her) paper on
the training, of- children.
This is of course theoretical; and all the
spinster says rolls off the mother like wa
ter off a duck's back.
She, too, once theorized the same way.
She looks at the programme again and
her face brains. "Mrs. Elizabeth "All
thingsâ"The - Training" and Culture of
Young Children." Heie she .will -at Jteast
get the practical side of It. '. .â¢ .
Mrs.- Allthines commences. ; 'â¢'â¢. . -^
She wades through a . labyrinth of preÂ«
liminaries and finally gets down to bed
rock, but the expectant -mother feels as
This ought to be practical, not bogus
theory.
This woman talks as If she knew where
of she spoke; her faith in her plans is
not of the shakable kind. Kj|
By the time she finishes the children
have been taken through thÂ© "middle
ages" to youth, and are the pride and joy
of their parents.
After the congress adjourns, the mother
of Johnny and Marguerite and the little
ones, works her way through the crowd
to* Mrs. Allthings, who looks to be on the
shady side of forty, whereas thÂ© anxious
mother is only thirty, therefore not so ex
perienced. ' * "V;.:/.
She says, "Excuse me, but how many
children have you? I suppose that the
eldest must be grown up and a great com
fort to you?"
Mrs. Allthings blushes; several of the
delegates smile; but the anxious mother
is not to be thus easily pushed away from
tasting of the tree of knowledge, so she
repeats her question, , slightly changed;
and presses her point, and Mrs. Allthing3
replies:
"Iâ Iâ have never had any children; but
Ik know. If I had. they would have been
brought up according to my theories."
Â¦â¢ And the mother of four young incorrlglj
bles goes home to meditate on her train-
Ing and wonder if her children aren't Just
the same as all others, and to tell their
papa the joke. For p.fter all. the only
ones who really know how. to train chil
dren are the women who never have any.
Mamma- feels that she* is somewhat of a
failure ; in . the "training line. '
; Papa acknowledges a like weakness.
l?ut they decide to struggle bravely on
together and do their very best.
Little Marguerite's failings are not Just
the same as Johnny's. She has some of
her own patented; she. may not be quite
so .mischievous as. her brother, but she is
fully ; as ; : wlllful. and eh'e develops an In

- | of the neck, of which poets have
Bung, is best revealed in Quarter
view photograph, but â¢ this also betrays
the fact that very few women have really
pretty shoulders. .
They look all right from the front Jp a
decollete bodice, but pose them from the>
back and they are absolutely ugly. Few
women have shoulders that matchâ that
Is. nearly ail have one shoulder higher.
than the other. In etreet suits, owing to
clever tailors and dressmakers, this lack
i of symmetry is scarcely perceptible, but
in a low gown with shoulder straps
omitted the defect is glaring.
Look about a ball room some time and
see if this assertion Is not true.
It is the corset that is responsible for
this deformity, for it certainly is a de
formity, of square shoulders. Did you
ever see a madonna In any of the old
Italian pictures with square shoulders?
JCot a bit of it
The rounded, regular shoulders are In
dispensable to beauty. They should slope
symmetrically In graceful curves from the
base of the neck to the summit of the
chest Go and study your Burke and see
what he says. "Of all the beautiful, ob-"
Jeets In nature none surpasses the well
. molded neck of a woman." He was not
writing about the big-throated, square-
Ehouldered, golf-playing, athletic modern
Ba9B
woman either. He referred to the | bWm
necked, sloping-shouldered beauty of his
time.
A too tight corset presses the , shoulder
blades below and collar bones in front too
far upward and thus ruins the. harmony
of nature. .:
The perfect figure should have shoulders
lacking salient bones and angles. The out
line should sweep In gentle curves from
the neck downward. There should be no
hollows, nor yet a superfluity bt. flesh..
That defect of the shoulders, where one
is higher thanithe other, is due tb many
causes. Golf or tennis in excess;, piano
playing, painting on porcelain ; â¢ any . num
ber.-, of . similar reasons can : be^ adduced.
It can be remedied by proper exercised but

to be ft fashion in shoulder's as in clothes, a
tradition among artists gives 'a* high -place, for
all ! time to the cnlumn-Uke neck of the un

Jones and Rossettt, have, reverted to this early

"Our daughter. Harry, the child whom
you never saw." whispered Minnie; to
whom indeed her husband's return seemed
less startling than to any of the other
spectatorsâ perhaps because, In her secret
heart, 'the fond wife hadnever ceased to
"hope against hope."

The Joy at her husband's reappearance

asked no questions regarding those nine
teen "years of- silence. She had always
cherished a secret hope that her husband
would return to her, and to-day this hope
had been- fulfilled; she had- him back
again.- and this bliss swallowed up all
other thoughts. It. was rather to the eag
er'ears, of the. re"5t of the party in the
vestry that Harry Alnslle now related the
strange ; tale of his adventures. since I e
had left :his young bride some nineteen
summers ago. . â¢ Â¦. â¢ j . .
: It was all too- true that the luckless
"Calliope had ,'Toundered at sea, 1 '.. but, as
often ; happened in such disasters, a< few
of the crew hai survived: Harry, and two
other . men. These had rigged up a raft
and been at. langth washed up on thÂ«
shores of a small uninhabited island in
the Pacific. Here they had remained tor
years, subsisting on game, fruit and fish
(happily the islet contained several
springs of fresh water) and having al3o
saved some few necessaries Â¦ from the
ship's stores on their raft. Years went
by without any hope of rescue, and Aina
lie was left the sola survivor of the trio
who had originally landed on the islet,
One of his companions had died very
shortly after the wreck (from Injuries re
ceived while m the water), the other
passed away some years afterward.
Thus Ainslie was left all alone and hers
hfs recollections became a blank. Some
ten years after the loss of the Calliope the
trew of a local trading vessel, driven out
of her course by contrary winds, landed
at the island in search of water. They
found what they sought: they also found
a man. clad in Kkins like a veritable Rob
inson Crusoe, who hailed them in Eng->
lish, but was unable to give any clear ac-Â»
count of himself, or to state how he came
where he was. The long years Of loneli
ness in this solitary islet had told
strangely upon Ainslie' 3 brain) and, by
one of those curious instances of lapse of
memory well known' tJ doctors, his mind
had become a complete blank regarding
the whole of his past life,
* The crew of the trading vessel toek him
.off in their boat, and, when on board the
vessel, the sight of -the familiar nautical
surroundings awoke remembrances of hia
old professional skill; whence his rescuers
concluded he must have been an officer
or captain of some wrecked vessel:; but;
Ainslie could tell them nothing of hia own
past life, nor even recall how long he had.
been on the island,. In all other respects
his mental faculties were sound, he eas
ily resumed the habits of civilization, and,
when he was landed at San Francisco,
whither the trading vessel 'was bound, the
tale of his romantic adventures attracted
interest and he found friends. But the
citizens of San Francisco had either never
heard of the Calliope's fate or had Ion?
ago forgotten it, and no one thought of
identifying the stranger with one of the
passengers of a vessel "missing" for over
ten years. -i - :
"John Smith." as he now called himself,
settled down to his work in a shipowner's
office, a quiet and silent man. with the sad
mystery of his own life ever pressing on
him. He made few acquaintances and led
an almost hermit existence, his one hope
and prayer being that he might regain,
the recollection of his past life, the knowl
.edge of his own identity. His wish was
answered by a sudden accident. Strolling
round the docks one day he found his
hand abcuptly grasped by the captain of
a lately arrived Knglish vessel.
"Good heavens, Ainslie, for you are
Ainslie I am sure, where have you been
hiding for the last nineteen years? We
thought the Calliope foundered then with
' all hands on board." -
"Ainslie!" The sound of his own name
brought back In a moment all the lost
past. Harry remembered all now. hia
wedding, his "last cruise." the shipwreck
â was all this nineteen years ago? Ex
planations rapidly ensued between Harrv
and his friend, a former schoolfellow and
early messmate, who had recognized Ains
lie, in spite of the lapse of years since
they had met. partly by hla features, also
by a personal peculiarity."
"When I saw you walking along I said
â¢ to myself, 'why. that must be Ainalie.
whom we all thought dead,' but when I
looked at your left hand I knew I was
right."
An accident In boyhood had necessitated
the amputation of the first joint of Har
ry's left hand little linger, and his friend
had not forgotten this mark.
Good Captain Barton was somewhat
perplexed to understand how a man.
sensible in all other points as Ainslie cer
. tairily was, could have so utterly forgot
ten his own name and identity for so
many years, but yielded at last to Ham
let's conviction that "there are more
things in heaven and earth than are
dreamt of In your philosophy.".
To fly back to England on the> wings of>
the wind was Ainslie's one desire, and it
was with a chill at heart that he yielded
to his friend's counsels to refrain from
writing or communicating until he ar
rived Jn person.
"Nineteen years fs a long -time to be
away." said Captain Barton, warnlngly.
and Ainslie understood the unspoken sen
timent that underlaid the words. His
wife might be now deadâ or another's!
Captain Barton could give no Informa
tion on the subiect; Minnie's life had been
too retired for her to keep up Intercourse
even 'with her husband's old friends, and.
it was with anxiety, even with dread,
'that AlnsÂ».e -returned to England and
hastened to t>e quiet, country village
where he had left his ' young bride so
many years before. And here, as we have
related, the long lost wanderer found the
faithful wife -waiting and hoping still,
and discovered in the bride whose wed
ding he so strangely Interrupted, a sweet
daughter of whose very birth he had been
S "A.nd now I have only found my daugh
ter to lose her again," as Harry would
' sometimes say In Jest, In the happy days
that followed. Â¦ -^j.-
But the "loss" had not separated
Marian very far from her parents, for
the Rectory and the . Knoll were close >
neighbors. Also, within a year of Ains
lie's return, another little daughter was
born at the Knoll, followed, In due time,
by a baby brother. Minnie Ainslie's cup
of happiness was now Indeed full; and, as
her friend3 said, she still looked "young
enough to be her daughter's sister."
The family circle â with some of the
nephews and niecei at the Rectory, so
closely contemporary with their little
aunt and uncle at the Knoll, was rather a
perplexing one to strangers; and the story
of Mrs. Alnslee's married -- life was pro
nounced a "real romance."
"W<s lost nineteen years of our married
life together, my darling," Harry would
sometimes say to his faithful wife, "but
I think we have all the accumulated hap
piness of those lost years granted to us
now-when we are together again." '
"I " never quite lost all hope/ Harry,"
whispered " Minnie, "not Â«even when they
made me wear my widow's dress. At
least; dearest, I felt you were mine al
ways, and I knew that we should meet
again one day, whether I went to you or
you returned to me. . You remember thÂ« â¢

husband, clasping his wife in his arms.
of his home, as she was already- of hU
heart. Minnte almost echoed the gossips'
cry regarding her own early wedlock: and
Mr Herbert half smilingly reminded the
mother that her daughter, if she married
him at once, would be an older bride than
she herself had been.
Again, in the pecond generation, tho
lovers' pleading overbore the hesitation of
the elders. The rector was all that was
cood and estimable: he had been a fa
miliar visitor in the Ainsleo household
ever since his induction into the parish
some four vears previously, and if hfs own
years, some ?hJrty-two in number, were
rather in advance of his bride's seventeen

KaidV it was a fault upon the right side,
"and another reason against delay"." as
xfr Herbert urged. Marian's father had
bL-n"but : 24 when he had wedded a yet
more eirllsh r ride.
"And you will not lose your daughter;
ehe will be close by,you still." pleaded the
prospective bridegroom; so Minnie yielded.
The wedding was to be a village festival.
The rector had becomo .very popular

passed away without ore word or token
from the missing; and even Minnie had
been forced to outwardly abandon hope,
to assume a widow's drers. to take legal
possession of her husband's property in
the interests of the baby who had come
to bless and comfort her In her desola

It was a long time before Minnie would
consent to own herself a widow; and even

the girl cherished some wild, vague hope

rector kindly but firmly, for he believed

to "accept the fact of her bereavement";
and Minnie was silent, but in her heart
the thought of the poet's story of "Enoch
Arden." a tale which has hÂ£d its many
counterparts in real life. "If my husband
comes back after forty years he shall at
least find me faithful and waiting for
him." thought the girl with a stifled sob.
More than once in the later years had
Minnie received an offer to change her
condition, offers which even the rector. .

blamed her for refusing.

*"I am waiting for Harry," said Minnie,
trith a bright flush on her cheek.
"My darling, he will never come again

"Then I will wait to go to him." said
Minnie firmly, and the old man said no

about him, as If desirous of making some
Inquiry. -
On a heap of stones at a corner of the
road sat old Roger, as he was popularly
called, one of the most venerable inhabi
tants of the village, very deaf, partially
blind, and therefore probably leas affected
by the general excitement than were the
rest of niÂ« neighbors. The grand daugh

gone off to the church with all her chil

rather a long one. and had wisely depos

expected to hear, had completely un

he had a duty to perform.
"My darling, 1 have injured you enough
already," he murmured passionately.
"Heaven knows I wish I had never lived
to return, at allâ as matters standâ but I
know your true, pure heart and I cannot
let you wrong yourself and an Innocent
man by tnklns this step in ignorance."
Bitter reflections surged in the mind of
this other "Enoch Arden" 'as he strode
up the narrow lane which led to the vil
lage church; but amid them all was no
hard thought of the wife who, as he be
lieved, was now taking upon herself, vows
to another. Nineteen years was an abÂ«

obliging Chileans had done something to
the bridge.. To the glance of the audi
ence she was hanging on a strand of rope;'
in reality she was supported by a good
strong wire hanging from the flies. As
the strand had no strength she depended
entirely, upon the wire. .
Lorena Atwood, who was playing lead-
Ing parts at one time, had blood-curdling
experiences. She' played the heroine's
part in "The Heart of. Maryland" and the
clapper of the bell was always a trouble
some thing to manage. At last it swung
hard against the side of the bell and with
one great blow the heroine was knocked
senseless. : ' '.' 'â¢ â¢ -
In one play where a tank of water was
used there came very near being a real
drowning. Sada Willis tripped when
she should have passed the tank; it stood
in the place, of an ocean and there was
plenty of real water in it, for the heroine
who shoud have fallen in, in the place of
Miss Willis, . was intended to- make a
"good splash. When bada fell-in it was her
good fortune that ; Bob Cummings' hap
pened to be looking on. Bob 1 let his own
Jurt go to wherever .t wanted to go and
plunged after her and he pulled out a
young lady . : - who was about as near
drowning as she ever wants to be. -
.Then one night the safe exploded too
explosively. It .went off with the usual
bangâ the. cap was an energetic "oneâ and
the small Â¦' children present with their
mammas were; the only ones frightened.
But when the stage hands went about
picking up the scattered properties they
found that Belle Baker was one. of those
properties. The -'explosion had tipped
over a scene which', had tipped over her
and in the general downfall she had
struck the edge of a table, whicn cut her
temple. It was no 'stage blood that she
shed, but the real thing. . :

hands as much out cf sight as she could
while she staggered across the stage to
climb the deck of a ship by clinging to a
ladder in order that she might save the

floor of the stage she had fainted and was
borne off the stage unconscious In the

system of â¢ telegraphy. From the mast of

land, the mysterious Hertzian waves car
ried the welcome message of the sighting
of the Sherman to the ocean beach station
and a few seconds later- the expectant
citizens of San , Francisco Tvere surprised
'with the glad news. ; *.^:V^ Â«
The Call on that memorable day set an
example, that has: been followed on two
continents and has won a victory for San

Farallones and the mainland.

lowed by the New York Herald In report-
Ing the result of the International yacht
THE CALL'S advocacy of the es
tablishment of a system of
wireless telegraphy between the
mainland and the Farallones
has resulted successfully, in
that Secretary Wilson of the
Agricultural Department has authorized
Chief Willis L. Moore of the United States
Weather Bureau to install a plant on the
sentinel rocks that nature has ; placed
thirty miles from the Golden Gate and en
trance to the bay of San Francisco.
Yesterday morning Alexander McAdie,
local forecast official of the Weather Bu
reau, received the following dispatch from
Chief Moore at Washington:.
"Secretary Wilson will authorize me to
Install a wireless system of telegraphy at
the Farallones and other Pacific Coast
stations Just es soon as there is any sys
tem suitable for installation."
With a system" of wlreles telegraphy be
tween the Farallones and Point Reyes and
Point Lobos the benefits that will accrue
cannot be overestimated. Xot only will it
be possible for Incoming ships to report
th/slr arrival off the coast lÂ«ng before
they could be sighted by the most power
ful marine telescopes, but in case of acci
dent or distress help . could , be summoned
froxxf the city and valuable Uves and prop
erty saved. 4
Storms that sweep across the ocean . to
ward the Pacific cAst could be reported
hours before Â»he barometer " would give
any indication of a change in the weath
er, and the early news thus given to
farmers and fruit grower* would â¢ result
In the saving of hundred* of thousands of
dollars worth of property. -
Front the evening 1 , hour on the 23d of
XuruBt, 1839, when Tfre Call by wireless
telegraphy signaled , the . arrival of the
transport- Sherman, with the First Cali
fornia Volunteers on board, experiments
have been carried on all over the world
with the mysterious Hertzian waves that
under the subtle hand of Gugllelmb Mar
coni have-Jaeen placed at the disposal of
mankind to annihilate space.. '.
GALL THE FIRST TO
TEST ITS UTILITY
The Call was ths first newspaper in the
world to give a practical demonstration^
"'of- the utility of Marconi's discovery and
invention. . -
Realizing the possibility that Marconi's
Invention. was destined, to revolutionize
the^system of teleBraphy, The Call dÂ«>
termlned to spare, no expense In putting
to a rigid test the claims made by. Mar
coni that it was possible to telegraph
without the aid of connecting wires. How
well the test succeeded Is known to every
living man, woman and, child who resided
In San Francisco on August 23, 1899. V
With a plant installed at the lightship,
nine miles from the Cliff. House, and a
sin-'ilar plant located on the ocean beach
messages were flashed through the, ether
day after day during the week when the
arrival of the Sherman was expected.
These messages sent by means of the
wireless system ,. were, however, experi
mental. The great question to be solved
by The Call was whether Marconi's claims
could be . considered as of practical use to
commerce.. The 'whole State of California
wras interested in thearrival of her flght
; ing sons from the swamps of the island of
Luzoiii- . On.alK eldes'.'the,' question : . was

fT IS doubtful if there is any great harbor in the world where .communication by means of wireless telegrauhy would be of greater value than
here in San Francisco, Nature has provided, it would almost seem, a 'great natural laboratory for the rneteorologist in the approaches to the
Golden Gate. No one can walk along the hills overlooking the bay without 'realizing tnat -the physical processes of cloudy condensation are he
shown to perhaps greater advantage than in any other part of the world. In simpler words, problems of fog formation are so wonderfulhere that
we wonder why some one does not attempt a critical study of the fogs. ( -
The loss of the ill-fated Rio de Janeiro a few months ago, appalling as the tragedy was, and in many ways it was the most remarkable a'cei
dent that ever happened to a ship within sight of land, removes the question of fog study from the purely, speculative , arid makes it incumbent
upon the commercial of San Francisco to see to it without delay that some means of quick and certain communication is established be
tween incoming and o tgolng vessels and the Fand. It seems to me that the Marconi method is exactly what is heeded at this port, It would also
be of great assistance to the forecaster, especially in connection with the heavy southeast storms which break in upon us during the* winter
months. And it should not be forgotten that even when established we shall have made but a BEGINNING in this great problem of communi
cating over a wide range of country without the; necessity of intervening metallic conductors* . ,

Local Forecast Official Alexander Mc-
Adle was Jubilant yesterday when he re
ceived the message from Chief Moore â¢ an
nouncing that San Francisco is' to have a
system of wireless telegraphy between
the city and the Farallones. -v
With a system of wireless telegraphy es
tablished at the Farallones, Point Lobos
and Point Reyes, an Incoming vessel
could keep posted as to her exact posi
tion from time to time, >-.â¢.'; . .
Pilot Jordan, who was in charge of tKe
Rio when she struck the rocks, testified
at the subsequent investigation that he
"tried .to get an echo from Point Diablo
after hearing the whistle of Point Bonita
on his beam." The atmospheric condi
tions that existed when the Rio met with
disaster may have so affected the sounds
of warning whistles that the, pilot was
confounded and led out of his course.
The prevalence of fog at the entrance
to San Francisco Bay renders It impera
tive that a system of rapid communica
tion be established between incoming
vessels and the city. It was clearly de
monstrated in the Investigation of the
loss of . the Rio that desperate chances
were taken by captains and pilots in
bringing their ships into this port. When
the fog obscured the .warning lights re
liance was placed on the fog whistles or
echoes secured from the â¢ shore -after
sounding the steamer's siren. It is well
known that sound is affected- by atmos

they had never heard anything of the
kind before. Following the direction
whence the sound'eame, everybody's gaze
was directed toward the bridge, where
the captaints and officers' quarters are lo
cated. *
' The tinkling telephone bell told the news
that ' the vessel, although, already under
full steam, was yet in. communication
with the shore by wireless telegraphy.
The passengers had'not yet seen the little

â¢From\Lon.don, W. B.. Hardy, (formerly

world wide notoriety ten years ago by. her
eccentricities, ;recerV^d the Â¦' news to-day
that she is living- almost in poverty. HavJ.

that .was left .her by her .father, she is
struggling..hard..in - an endeavor to keep
the wolf from the door, supporting her
self and three children'by keeping. a lodg
ingr-house in an' obscure part of London. '
" Frankie Brown first achieved notoriety
when ! j she â¢â¢Â¦ married '; Frank â¢ McKee, . Â¦'â¢' a
printer, in order that she might become a
widow. She was "the daughter of - Abrani
C. Brown,' a wealthy Oaklunder. who died
somewhere 'along ... in! the '*90's, leaving
$120,000 to be divided among Frankie and
two- boys, Frederick and Harry Brown:
W. B. Hardy was named* as her guardian.-
Frankie started in immediately to spend j
her patrimony. Naturally 7 of a willful and
generous disposition she exceeded- all
bounds when the parental . restraint was
removed by death. She bought, the .most
expensive trousseau that money could:, buy;
including a sealskin coat that, came down
to her knees. She wore all kinds of jewel- '
ry and ; was altogether attractive. Being
a woman, of more than ordinary beauty
she would I have ,been attractive . without
the additional ornamentation. She was
tall and slender and of the blonde type
of beauty.
The whim to see the sights of 'Europe
seized Frankie after she had seen every
thing "commonplace in California, but she
did not want to travel -without a chap
eron. How to do Europe without a chap
eron was to even her acute mind, whieh
saw a way out of every difficulty, some
thing of a Gordiari knot. She confided this
dilemma to one R. M. Apgar, clerk in a
San â¢ Francisco Police Court. He solved
that problem for her. -
Apgar I told Miss Frankie- that a friend
of his, Frank McKee, a printer, was dying
of consumption in Oakland, and he sug
gested to her that she marry him so that
she could become a widow. Once a widow
she could go where she pleased.
. Frankie thought it was a capital Idea
and she -acquiesced. Apgar acted as the
go-between and perfected the arrange
ments. McKee agreed to. marry Miss
Frankie if she would undertake to pay
all his doctors' bills during, his lifetime
and his funeral expenses after death.
After the couple were married Frankie
went East, probably to escape the noto
riety her acts brought upon her. McKee
lingered for a year after the wedding.
When he died Frankie came back to Cali
fornia and attended the funeral. She kept
'her word about the expenses and the fu
neral is said to have cost her $1000. -
While she was touring Kuropeas Mrs.
Frankie McKee, widow, she met and fell
desperately in -love with, Arthur. Brans
comb, an actor. He had a wife, and two
children and the widow was disappointed.
When she recovered she wore a bright red
dress. In Hyde Park, and the .news went
all over the world. ,. ... : â /'. â¢
Frankie.once expressed a desire to mar

but the husband abused her so much that
'she was glad to get rid t>f r him. They be

it was not hia desire to inconvenience
them, but he would not feel justified in
discharging them, 1 and ordered them back.

The defendant did not move a muscle,

that the jury be polled. Each gave an

several years Brown 'has noticed that
upon ' the surface of a large marsh on
his ranch bubbles were continually rising
and that there seemed to be ajjeculiar
odor in the air near that place. While he
often spoke of it he never gave the matter
any particular thought until yesterday, |
when a camper suggested , the possibility
of the bubbles being caused by a flow
of natural gas. The matter was at once
looked Into and -the theory was found to
be correct. / .Â¦-.Â¦â¢â¢'â¢
This morning a large sheet-iron caldron
used . for mixing sheep dip was placed in i
an Inverted position ' upon the surface of
the marsh and a lighted match was ap- )
plied to a hole punctured in the bottom
of the caldron. . A flame six feet in height
burst Into view and burned steadily and
brilliantly until extinguished by those
present. It is generally believed that a
new 1 and valuable addition to . the re
sources of Mendocino County has been
discovered and * new industry is about to
be inaugurated. - >

SAX BERNARDINO, June 22.â News
reached here this afternoon of the thrill
ing experience and narrow escape from
death of Miss Frances Fuller, aged 16
years, and George Filler, aged 17, children
of "\V. H. Fuller, a prominent L*>s Angeles
attorney, and their guest, Miss Emma
Allen, aged 24 years, an art teacher, who
resides at 4910 Prairie avenue, Chicago.
At an early hour yesterday morning the
young people started from their summer
camp at SQUirrel Inn, thirty miles from
this city, for the purpose of exploring the
adjacent country. They failed to return
by dark and their absence greatly alarmed
their parents Â¦ and two hundred friends
â¢who are spending: the season at the moun
tain resort. ' *
A searching party oJ twenty experienced
mountaineers was sent out at 10 o'clock
last night. The searchers returned with
young Fuller, whom they had found in an
unconscious condition on a dangerous
mountain trail. The \youngr people had
lost their bearings and were unable to
get out of Dead Tree Canyon. Fuller
started to reach the camp, but en route
he fell from hunger and exhaustion.
Another searching party started out and
at 8 o'clock this morning discovered the
young women almost dead from exposure
and hunger. They, too, had abandoned
the struggle to find civilization and laid
down to die. All during the night they
had tramped over steep mountain sides
and thrpugh rugged canyons in frantic
efforts 'to reach their friends. The cries
of wild beasts added horror to
their perilous surroundings. Miss Allen,
contracted poison oalt while making her
exit through the thick underbrush and her
condition is regarded as precarious.
At one point a large rock fell from a
precipice 300 feet high, and, striking Miss
Fuller, rendered her insensible for an
hour. When found the two were unable
to articulate owing to their gTeat suffer
ing from thirst. There' was no water in
that section and had not their rescue
been effected this morning they would
not have survived the day. The posse
was compelled to carry both young
women to camp, six miles distant.

and a reasonable hope of success who
would say that' the Catholic church was
not in favor of that cause which was
symbolized by the immortal flag of green?

Yorke;. "it depends on ourselves, the scat

Father Yorke was enthusiastically re
ceived with cheers. â¢ He was to have deliv
ered an address on Wolfe Tone, but it
was very late before he began, and he
therefore spoke of the Irish cause in a
more general way: He said that in South
Africa the same pl.-Mi was being carried
out 'by, "the Pharisee nation" that the
Spanish had pursued in Cuba. Had any
other /nation than England done what the
English were doing the whole world would
rise in denunciation of it. There are 63,000
Boers, of whom 30,000 are women and chil
dren, herded in: the British detention
camps? where the children are dying at
the rate of 300 per month. Practically all
the women and children of the two repub
lics had â¢ been swept into camp. There
they were poorly fed and the mortality
was large. ,
.The history, of England at the beginning
of the twentieth century, he said, had
been her history ever since VStrongbow"
was in Ireland and women and children
had been shot down in the streets of Irish
villages. Meeting on the anniversary of
the birth of Wolfe Tone, he hoped for the
time when the Irish -would repay In heap
ed up, crowded in -and overflowing meas
ure the debt that is due to "the robber
nation of the world." Catholic theology
did not oppose revolution when there was
just cause and' a reasonable hope of suc
cess. There were both in the case of Ire
land. Constitutional agitation would only
have effect, when the English Government
believed that there was some force back

- What the Irish had done in South Afri
ca, he said, they were ready to repeat in
Ireland. They did not stop fighting in
South Africa until the war had reached
the guerrilla stage. Then, being without
the prime essential of guerrilla warfare,
horses, they had to stop.
"We left many Â¦ in soldiers' graves, but
we kept the flag of Ireland unsullied. You
can take up that ' flag if you will. We
hope to take it up in our own island home,
never to drop it until ' we have swept
away the last vestige - of the empire of
hell."
He described thfe start of the Irish
Brigade for the front in; South 'Africa. 5
"The Irish flag" was flying over us and
vengeance was - burning . in our hearts.
I could not help feeling that at last we
were going out to fight England, but
wished that we were fighting for Ireland,
In Ireland."
"If freedom is worth having," said
Major McBride; "it is worth fighting for;
and if it is not worth fighting
for it is not worth having." He
spoke; ' of ./ Wojfe, Tone, Fitzgerald,
Emmet, Mitchel, . O'Mahoney. Stephens
and others, and : said * that ; * they
had the right spirit.-. Talking would never
achieve Irish independence. He had faith
that the Irish cause ' would live until the
Â¦ laurel wreath; of = victory is .placed upon
the flag of Erin.'- Americans whipped
the Â¦â¢Â¦â¢English-* twice and the Boers were
whipping them to-day, he said. The time
of the Irish might come to-morrow.

Giorgiani, Chairman Mellott "made a few
preliminary remarks, filled with patriotic
sentiment, and then introduced Major
McBride. Owing to the demonstration
Major .- McBride was .unable to -^ proceed

of. the work of the, Irish Brigade in South
Africa- -and 'recounted' the deeds of valor

The Invited Quests.
The reception by the Knights of the Red
Branch to Major John McBride in Metro
politan Temple last evening on th# 137th
anniversary^ of the birth of Theobald
Wolfe Tone was marked with great en
thusiasm. There " were two , ringing
speeches, one by Major McBride and the
other by the RÂ«v. Peter, C. Yorke, both of
which called forth prolonged cheering.
The principal idea "V advanced by. both
speakers was that if the Irish wished to
secure national independence they must
be ready to fight for it and that parlia
mentary agitation without the force of
ready and warlike men behind it would
never give Ireland its righta. At one
stage of the proceedings, after theVid
dress by Major McBride, an enthusiastic
Irishman in the gaJlery arose and called
for three cheers for Ireland and Oom
Paul, which were given. ' . .
The hall was handsomely decorated
with, harps.' Irish flags, American flags,
streamers of red, white and blue, flowers
and the emblem of the Knights of the Red
Branch. . In front of the organ a harp
blazed in electric lights and above it was
a star.- also electrically illuminated. On
the stage were T. J. Mellot the presiding

BERLIN, j June 22 This has been a 1
week of speeches and regattas, favored
during the last half by fine, sunny
weather. It began with the unveiling of \
the Bismarck memorial in front of the j
Reichstag building Sunday, which drew i
to Berlin thousands of people from every '<
part of Germany and many thousand for- <
dgners, including many American tour- ;
lstx Count voa Billow's oration on that Â¦
occasion greatly surprised the Emperor, ;
because the whole tona differed from his :
Majesty's conception of Bismarck's :
a.chitfvements, in which the Emperor only â¢
saw a servant doing his master's bidding. ;
This his Majesty emphasized at the time .
by the Inscription on the wreath deposit- j
ed at the foot of the statue. It read: "Tor â¢
the Great Emperor's Great Servant."
The Liberal press thinks it impossible to
grant the AgTarian demands, which
mean that the renewal of the commercial
treaties will be rendered most difficult.
The Agrarian press has denied this cau
tiously and the Conservative press has Â¦
kept eilent. The whole press was agree
ably affected by the Emperor's statement -
that peace Is now secured for a number of
years to come.
The Cologne Volks Zeltung to-day criti
cally reviews his Majesty's Cuxhaven
cpeech and says:
The Emperor has by his words corroborated
what is claimed by the Center, namely, that the
China expedition has been a total failure, for
If the Chinese war is . really ended, what has
Germany achieved by it? Not even the reim
bursements of her actual outlay and certainly
sot the enlaxgerftent of her Chinese possessions;
ncr has it brought harmony among the powers
In China. It is notorious that there have been
almost constant wrangling and jealousies
among: them. It would have been better If %
Germany had alone punished China for Baron
von Ketteler's death. No power could have
Â«tjected and the punishment would then have
teen adequate to the enormity of the crime.
The Emperor, who personally steered
the Empress' yacht, the Iduna, in the race
Trlday, came In fourth, losing a prize.
His Majesty entered a protest against the
winner, the Comet, but the Judges decided
against him.
Among the foreign ships which have ar
rived in Kiel harbor for the occasion is
the Russian armored cruiser Svietlana,
commanded by the Grand Duke Alexis, to
Â¦whom the Emperor showed special atten- j
tions.
The German press has not commented
tin the Washington red book's statement
regarding the Spanish-American war and
Germany's non-declaration of neutrality.
It Is said that Germany's action in not
instituting a declaration of neutrality has
been simply in accordance with German
policy, established since Bismarck's time,
and did not have any unfriendly mean-
Ing, either toward the United States or
Spain.
Germany has now secured twenty-two
steamers for the transportation home of
her troops in China, winding up August
SI from Shanghai with the Princess Irene.
It is significant that the entire German
press is discussing the chances of Dr.
von Siemens, director of the Deutsche
Bank, and â¢ Herr Ballin, director of the
Hamburg- American line, both of them
outspoken Liberals, entering the Cabinet
at the Emperor's wish. The Vossische
Zeitung, Independent â¢ Liberal, says
neither of them can afford It, as it would
mean degradation from their exalted po
eition as "royal merchants" to compara
tive official insignificance.
After yesterday's large pro-Bismarck
demonstration at Friedrlchsruhe those
who took part in It wired to Henry La
bouchere: "God bless all honest English
men who champion the Justice and utith
of the Boer cause." V
The affairs of Camp Reverie are tn the
hands of an energetic and capable man
agement and the success of the camp and
satisfaction to guests Is assured beyond
- question.
The fare for the round trip Is only $2 50,
eo It Is easy to run up for a day and in
vestigate. The railroad schedule allows
at the camp on week days three hours and
titty, minutes and on Sundays four hours
end forty minutes.
The office of the Camp Reverie Associa
tion Is located at. 81 Flood building, San
Francisco, where full particulars can be
had. Booklets containing complete infor
mation may also be had at all offices of
the California Northwestern Railway.
A special feature will be a regular morn-
Ing programme, consisting of addresses
by well known speakers on various sub
jects of public interest, besides musical
and other forms of entertainment In the
evenings. -..â¢ : . v,;
It is practically a hotel, or more strictly
speaking, a city under canvas, and yet en
tirely different from the ordinary hotel or

Camp Reverie is situated in one of the
most picturesque sections of the State,
among the Russian River redwoods, and I
Is reached by the line of the California
Northwestern Railway, being only three
and a quarter hours' ride from San Fran
cisco.
To glance at the summer resort page
of the dally papers, it would eeem no dif
ficult task to flnd a suitable place â in
Â¦which to spend a vacation, yet the very
fact that California has so much to of

It extremely difficult to make a selection.

The "Welsh contingent of the United

which assures a musical festival of strong
artistic merit. There Is a native institu
tion In Oakland, ; under , the direction
cf that genial . Welshman, D. P.
Hughes, that I think would stand an
excellent chance in the female chorus
competition. I refer to the Hughes Club,
a large chorus that has been studying
faithfully under Mr. Hughes' leadership
for some three years now and from which
I have heard some exceedingly good work.
I don't know that It would be possible to
Â«xport the club to BuSalp, but I am quite
willing to venture a prophecy as to Its
euccess when it got there. If any. club or

ar^HE : memorv of a man may suffer more from the acts of his foal disciples than from the

Colonel Robert Ingersoll's memory is just now getting punished by some people in
Ohio, who in his name have organized* an agnostic society and pretend to perpetuate the
teachings of the great agnostic. Â¦They, have gone about this: by celebrating what they call an ag- I
nostic' marriage, in which the vows were 'conditioned and the tie' was like, that free love union
which was practiced by the followers of Dr. Noyes.- : '- \ . Â¦Â¦'": ....... v . .
There is nothing in 'agnosticism;iiqr in 1 the^eachings of Ingersoll in support of such a pre- :
tended marriage. The laws of all the most civilized nations recognize marriage as a. civil con
tract, dissoluble or enforcible in the courts of /justice. The necessity for such view of the contract
arises in the. concern that third parties may have in it. -Jt affects the descent of -property and
the title of estates.-ahd inheritance and title are matters litigable, for they, concern "property. -.'.
Among the ignorant who call themselves agnostics and rejoice in a heresy which they do 'Â¦
not comprehend, there has grown up the opinion that is back, of this Ohio movement. Such :
people' think that the monogamous marriage is derived from the institution of Christianity,, car
rying Ayith it the indissohible; intent. The fact is that there- is no injunction on the subject
. among the germs of thristianity except Paul's advice that deacons should be sober and discreet
persons and have but one wife. That limitation alone, is evidence that among the early Christians
polygamy prevailed, and : was forbidden only to certain officers of the congregation.
In fact, polygamy was a venerable and deservedly honored institution in its day, for it
. succeeded just such promiscuous, go-as-you-please, catch-as-catch-can association of the sexes as
these Ohio agnostics propose in the ; name ofclngersojjj To the philosophic mind the beginning
of polygamy was the beginning of man's advance in civilization. It meant 'that he differentiated
himself from the beasts that perish! To such mind also the end of polygamy 'marked man's rise
to a still higher civilization, but the advance was not due to any direct, inspired, religious com
- mand. -Early Christians were polygamists and the primitive Christian princes ofEurope\were not
scrupulous as -to; plurality- in the married relation. The early agnostics, of the-, period that in
cludes the first;half-thousand years of the Christian era, were neither more nor less free and loose
in their matrimonial affairs than the civilization of which they- were a part/ *
Â¦Â¦Â¦::Â¦ -These Ohio folks think they are making a point ,'against Christianity by their, goose and
gander marriage, when they are only flying in the face of that decency which is an attribute of
civilization.. The morals and ethics taught In- Colonel Ingersoll were the morals and ethics of
civilization, and the humanity, the mercy, charity and love which he inculcated were of the high- .
est and "purest rorden His disagreement with the plan of salvation, the fall and atonement, was
almost forgiven by the church because of the .purity of his, morality and his high ascription to'.

ABUSE OF INGERSOLL.
y^^ HIEF W. L. MOORE of the United States Weather Bureau has telegraphed to Mr.
I " .. McAdie of the local bureau 'that Secretary Wilson will authorize the installation of
a wireless telegraph service, between San Francisco and the Farallones, and also at
. other points on the Pacific, Goast, as soon as there is asystem suitable- for installation.
We have then a promise of wireless telegraphy to be in operation in the near. future, for ,
there is at this time no doubt whatever that the Weather. Bureau can find a "suitable system"
almost as it begins to look for it. Wireless telegraphy is in fact no longer an. experiment. We
.recently had occasion to direct* attention to the success achieved with it by the steamship
Lucania in sending messages to various points along the English' coast while the -steamer was
making her way down the channel.^ Several of the messages were -received, and others seht by
the steamer at a time when she was so far at sea that land was not visible. .:â¢â¢;
The experiments made on trie Lucahia are noted only because they are the latest to which
particular attention has been drawn. As a matter of fact the system is now so well established
that t"he great steamers on the Atlantic have been fitted with the Marconi apparatus, and new'
ships now being, constructed are to have a room designed especially for wireless telegraphing. )
The swift advance of the new method of telegraphing is one of the marvels of the age. It
is; but a short time since the system was the subject of ridicule by; the incredulous. The Call was
the first newspaper in the world to take up the invention and apply it to practical use.. ' That was
done by The Call as a .'part of the arrangements made to , report the coming of the transppft bear
ing the California Volunteers on their return from the Philippines! . The test made* of. the, system
on that occasion was completely . successful, and was undoubtedly the most notable stroke of
'newspaper enterprise ever accomplished on this coast. In fact it was an achievement of world
wide interest and attracted attention Â¦everywhere."' ' Â¦ Â¦_'Â¦<Â¦Â¦
The next notable use of the new system was that made by The Call and the Herald in re- "
porting the- international yacht race. That was a direct result of the success obtained here,, so
that the : New York experiment may be said to have been .brought about by the 'test, at San Fran
cisco. Consequently the credit of leading, in the development of this latest marvel of science be
longs to this city. "\ ' l *~ , Â¦' Â¦ ;
Rarely has any great invention been met with a greater storm of ridicule. than this. When
The Call accomplished the feat of getting reports across the water from a vessel off the Golden
Gate, and the announcement was made of the means by which it .'was done,.'the Examiner scoffed
and' scouted and flouted for days. It derided the inventor by,calling him "Macaroni."- -Later on
Â¦when -the system was 1 used by The Call and in reporting the yacht race, it returned to the |
attack and again jeered at the. inventor as well as at the system and The Call: Now. the yellow
journal will at last have to admit that wireless telegraphy is a practical system of dispatching mes-- |
sages; and the chances are it will claim to have been the author of the .whole thing.
The Call having been the. first paper in the world to have faith in the invention, the first
â¢ to make practical use of it, has also been first fn urging the Â¦Government : to the system.

Progress of Producers, l
The Los Angeles Times reports the pro
gress of the Los Angeles oil producers on
their way to combination and handling
of their product as follows:
the oil encountered at 1400 feet is better
than most of that found In the district,
being of lighter gravity. There also ap
pears to be plenty of oil at that depth.
If these 'Statements are verified the sig
nificance to the oil Industry of California
Is great. The supply; of oil Is increased
and the quality will pay for going deeper.
The Los Angeles Herald says :
Evidence grows that the Standard OH Com
pany has fortified Haelf In the Kern River
better than is generally , known. Those famil
iar with the oil situation in the San Joaquin
Valley expect that the next few weeks will
bring to light a great many facts with which
the general public is not familiar. The Stand
ard Is building additional tankage in the Kern
River field and will be able to store in the
neighborhood of a half million barrels of oil,
which will put it in a position to give steady
supply, to consumers who are -yet hesitating
about the change to the new . fuel fÂ»r. fear
they cannot secure a. continuous. supply. With
control of the Kern River situation, the Stand

Railroad Has Its Scheme
' to Manipulate the
' "Oil Men.
Los Angeles Makes Advance
Toward Marketing Its
Product.
The Southern Pacific Company Is again
opposing the oil producers and apparently
the oil men are not . aware of the opposi
tion. It : is well known that oil is being
extensively used by the railroad as fuel*
and the facilities for Â¦ handling this have
been increased from time to time. Oil
burners are being added to engines and
all indications point to the exclusive use
of ollas a fuel. The cost of the two fuels,
coal and oil, compared, shows a difference
in favor of oil of 'almost one-thirdâ this
with oil at 75 and 80 cents per barrel.' If
oil should decline It is not unreasonable to
suppose' that coal will do the same, which
will mean a still greater saving for the
ra'jlroad â an addition, of thousands of dol-
lars to the earnings of the road. '.
In v order to handle the output of the
company's wells in the Kern River and
McKittrick districts immense storage
tanKs have been erected and it was omy
recently that a 30,000-barrel tame was
completed at Tucson. All this was for
the s accommodation of oil for the use of
the company. - .
The Call has told its readers of the pur
chase of oil lanus in Texas for the rail
road-by J. B. Treadwell, the company's
oil land expert, who is in charge of the
company wells in the Kern River and
McKittrick j districts. Following these
preparations and along the same lines a
contract was recently made with the
Lacy Manufacturing Company of Los
Angeles for the erection of several 30,000
barrer storage tanks in Texas and Louisi
ana. Work was ordered rushed with all
possible speed. The Eastern concern sup
plying the material was requested to
hurry the same forward and shipments
were started to their various destinations
as fast as the mill could turn them out.
All these 5 preparations have ; suddenly
stopped. The shipments are being al
lowed to come forward, but when the ma
terial is received it will not be put to
immediate use, as was the original inten
tion. An official decree has been Issued
to the effect that the work is not to pro
ceed until further orders. - The material 13
to be stored until, in the indefinite future,
the order shall be given to proceed with
the erection- of the tanks.
To the oil men in the Texas and Louis
iana fields this will doubtless be discour
aging, for on its face it would appear that
the policy of the company as regards the_
use of oil as a fuel, has changed; that oil
will not be the exclusive fuel,' and that no
attempt will be made to handle the output
of the fields mentioned. . This would ap
pear to be the case, but appearatices are
deceitful. There Is, back of this order,
much to be consideredâ another thrust of
this" powerful corporation' at Its less
powerful antagonists ; another move in
the game which has been going on since
the oil industry reached its present stand
ing; another maneuver of the railroad in
the war upon the oil men. .
Finding 1 Lower Stratum.
A pipe line has been completed by the
McKittrick company to the railroad.
The second attempt to organize a,min
ing district in the Midway failed. The
Temblor and Kramer districts will try to
organize. â¢ ,
Contracts have been let for the drilling
of a well at Goleta and another at Car
penteria. No oil has yet been struck at
either of those places, but expectation 1b
strong on the part of the prospectors that
they will find the fluid.
The exports of petroleum In May show a
gain in amount over May of last year of
over 13,000.000 gallons. The falling off in
price makes the value less by about
$300,000.
The Grace Company, in the Kern River
field, has found a stratum at a depth of
1400 feet that no other oil men have pre
viously discovered. It has also broken
the record for depth in that field. It will
be recollected that A. S. Cooper, then
State mineralogist, predicted that drilling
to lower levels in California- oil fields
would probably result in finding higher
grade oils. The Grace company would
seem to have verified that prediction for
that locality at least. It is reported â¢ that

FREE TO WEAK MEN.
A New and Successful Method
of Restoring Weakened Phys-
ical Powers, Curing Sexual
Weakness, Nerve Exhaustion
and Lost Vitality.
The Prescription Is Sent Free to Any-
one Who Writes. ;
A new scientific means of curing weaknesses
of men and diseases peculiar to the aex has
at . last been discovered, and the prescription
is being offered free to all who send name and
address. â¢;.Â¦â¢â¢. . ,, ; :,- ; \
Â¦ Dr. ,' U. G. 1 1/lpes, 1 1435 Stevenson building,
Indianapolis, Ind., is the discoverer of this
remarkable new system of treatment, . and he
says there is now no difficulty in curing the
worst cases which may arise from diseases of
this nature.
The Doctor has made a Ions study of Sexual
Disorders and he claims to have found the
exact medicine which removes/all 'traces of
debilitating disease from the -human- system,
restores the fire and buoyancy of youth, and
supplies the- strength of body and nerves that
all wish for but so few possess. Impotency,
nightly emissions, varieoeele, nervousness and
kindred troubles' disappear in a marvelously
short Â¦ space of time, while any weakened or
emaciated organs are restored in a vjery few
days to their natural size and vigor. ' .
When you stop to consider the possibilities
of loving and being loved as only strong, well
and happy men can be it does seem that any
sexually, weak man should no longer hesitate,
but write at once for the receipt which costs
absolutely nothing. There are no restrictions
whatever, as Dr. Llpes is anxious that every
afflicted man who needs it should have the
benefit of one of his free prescriptions with-
out delay. The treatment can be used in the
privacy of your own home without the knowl-
edge of even your most Intimate friend or as-
sociate.
Write to-day and learn that while the re-
ceipt costs you nothing at all, it may change
your whole existence from one of misery to
a continuous life of pleasure and happiness, i

MUCH CONTROVERSY ARISING OVER THE GOLD
DREDGING OPERATIONS ALONG FEATHER RIVER
The gold dredging operations along the
Feather River have given rise to a con
troversy among the newspapers published
ln the interior. On one side such papers
as the Woodland Democrat and^the Co
lusa Sun are Inclined to discuss the ulti
mate effect upon Butte County. The Oro
vllle Mercury, on the other hand, speaks
of the prosperity which dredging for gold
has brought to Oroville. Already there
are warm expressions of opinion. Tho |
Sun paints a picture of the future when
it foresees that "as the gold will have
been taken out Oroville will have a big
hole, a pile of bowlders and a burrowing
place for badgers, skunks, rattlesnakes
and owls." The Woodland Democrat says
that "about 4000 acres of the most pro
ductive bottom land has been acquired by
mining companies; some of the finest or
chards in the State are disappearing and
the dredger is sterilizing land that has
heretofore produced enormous crops of
hay and grain. Wherever the dredger
operates tho soil disappears, and there is
not earth enough left to sprout the hard
iest plant known." The Democrat also
says:.;
That "dredger mining in that district is a
profitable enterprise is absolutely certain. Men
of experience and capital are engaging in it.
Dredgers are multiiilylng and they are ln
operation day and night. But it is an enter
prise that destroys 'the eouice from which It
derives its Â¦ wealth. An acre of land that la
worth $300 or $100 to-day may be absolutely
valueless next month. The gold that Is washed
out of the soil is not invested in local enter-'
prises. It is not utilized to develop the re
sources and add to the assessment roll of the
county. It is shipped out of the county and
only Â¦ ao much of it ' ever comes back as is
necessary to keep up repairs and pay the few
men employed. The capital is in the main for
eign and the men who furnish it live else
where and employ the income derived from
tne dredging enterprise to increase their wealth
and permanent investments in another State
and possibly, ln another country.
Tlie Miners' Vie^w.
The Oroville Mercury presents the other
side of the matter in a long article, from
which some extracts are taken:
There are about 200 men employed in and
on and about the dredgers in this vicinity and
they receive an average of about $100 per
month each, i The total of salaries Daid by
these dredgers is about $20,000 per month. The
evidences of the prosperity to which the dredg
ers have contributed are to be seen on every
hand. During the past two years there has
scarcely ever been a vacant dwelling ln the
town and new ones have been building all the

THE British thip King Edward ar
rived from Antwerp yesterday aft
er a Ions trip of 1S7 days. Soon
after leaving Antwerp she was
caught in a heavy gale and had
to put into the Downs for repairs. One
seaman was drowned and the second mate
and an A_ B. also had very narrow es
capes. They were washed overboard and
there seemed no chance of saving them.
The wind was Wowing with hurricane
force and a high cross sea was running.
Luckily one of these contrary waves pick
ed up the mate and the A. B. and washed
them back on the deck of the King Ed
vard.
Captain Newman's account of the voy
age is as follows:
"Sailed from Antwerp December 17. Had
a succession of â¢westerly gales in. the Brit
ish Channel lasting four days. Put Into
the Downs December 2S.oa account pf
blowing away sails, running gear carried
away and cargo shifted. Also lost over
board H. Carlson, a seaman. He was a
native of Sweden, aged 2S years. The
second officer and a seaman named C.
Wilson were washed overboard and then
washed back again by the returning, wave.
"Made necessary repairs and sailed
from the Downs on January 5. Had fine
weather to the equator, which we crossed
in longitude 27 degrees west, ihlrty-two
days out. Took the southeast trades ln
lctitude 2 decrees north and carried them
to latitude 15 degrees south. Had south
west winds to latitude 50 degrees south'
tr.d was twenty-five days from 50 ln the
Atlantic to 50 in the Pacific Had a suc
cession of northerly rales rounding the
Horn. Crossed the equator May 11 ln
longitude 118 degrees west. Had north
northwest winds from latitude 11 degrees
to 30 decrees north. Had light airs and
caJms to latitude SS decrees north and had
northwest winds and a dense foe for the
last fourteen days."
THE BRITISH SHIP KING EDWARD, WHICH ARRIVED FROM ANTWERP YESTERDAY, HAD A HARD TIME
OF IT IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AND WAS COMPELLED TO PUT INTO THE DOWNS IN DISTRESS SHE
LOST SAILS. RUNNING GEAR AND A SEAMAN.

FAMILY FOOD.
Crisp, Toothsome and Requires No
A little boy down In N. C. asked his
mother to write an account of how
Grape-Nuts Food had helped their
family.
She Eays Grape-Nuts was first brought
to her attention on a visit to Charlotte,
where she visited the Mayor of that city
who was using the Food by the advice of
his physician. She Eays: "They derive
bo much grood from It that they never
pass a day without using it. While I was
there I used the Food regularly. I gained
aixmt fifteen pounds and felt so well that
when I returned home I began using
Grape-Nuts in the family regularly.
My little 18 months old baby shortly
after being weaned was very 411 with
dyspepsia and teething. She was sick nine
weeks and we tried everything. She be-
came so emaciated that It was painful
to handle her and we thought we were
going to lose her. On* day a. happy
thought urged me to try Grape-Nuts
soaked in a little warm milk.
Well, it worked like a charm, and she
began taking it regularly and Improve-
ment set in at once. She Is now getting
well and round and fat as fast as pos-
sible and on Grape-Nuts.
Some time ago a number of the i family
were stricken with La GrippÂ© at the
same time, and during the worst stages
we could not relish anything- In. the shape
of food but Grape-Nuts and oranges,
everything els* nauseated us.
We all appreciate what your famous
food baa dono for our family." ,

. The Board of Public "Works, through Its
architect's department, has blundered
again, -this time in the preparation qf
plans for an additional story to the Dud
ley Stone School. Two weeks ago the
board submitted plans and specifications
for the work to the Boardj of Education,
and the estimated cost was fixed at $5800.
Yesterday amended plans were submitted
in which the estimated cost is placed at
$7000. The Board of Works assigns as a
j reason' for the increase the rise in price
of building material, ; which it claims has
gone up in the past two weeks. There
would appear to be another, reason, and
that is .that the board erred. in Its first
estimate, which is borne out by the bids
submitted for the work, all of which were
greatly in .'excess of the estimates/ and
were .rejected. .-Â¦':;" /
J. Sinnott was the lowest bidder for the
work, his bid being $7697. The next low
! est bid, was that of Jacob Schuler. $9485.
I Sinnott made the mistake of filing a certi
fied- check for $100 only, the charter pro
viding that 10 per cent of the contract
price shall be deposited for f aithf nl per
formance of contract. Schuler. raised the
point that Sinnott's bid was "defective In
the point mentioned and claimed- that he,
as next lowest -bidder, should be given
the contract. Schuler Is a member of the
Builders' Association, which requested
IJeo Park; secretary of the Board of
Works, to appear before it and ex
plain why the contract had not been
awarded to - Schuler. The association
stated" that . if the explanation was not
satisfactory its members would refuse to
bid Â¦ on - the next specifications. Park ex
plained ,to the association yesterday that
the bids had been rejected because they
were in excess of the estimates i of the
Works Board and the Beard o& Education
had positively declined to spend one cent
more for the improvement. This was sat
isfactory to the Builders' Association,
which agreed to allow its members to file
new bids.- . :. .
| Then it was that the Board of Works
raised its former estimate, a tacit
acknowledgment that its first was too
I low. ; Notwithstanding that certain feat
ures were eliminated from . the original
plans the estimated cost Is increased by
$1200. Double floorings have been taken
out and only one coat of paint will be laid
on the old wood work. Commissioner
Manson says that the City Architect has
added certain details not Included In the
preliminary -estimates, which ; called for
an addition too severely plain, and the In
creased cost of material made up the bal
ance. aUEKMtUtSBSi

Â¦j Republican ; Primary League. \
During the last few days, to evince their
earnest - desire to secure harmony among
all well meaning Republicans, the direct
ors of the Republican Primary League
have * entertained suggestions looking ta
the consolidation of the league with the
body known as the California Republican
Association, or Grand Hotel : Club. Both
bodies claimed to be organized for the
same purpose, uamely/to abolish the per
nicious influence of the bosses in primary
and general elections, and there seemed
to be no good reason why any body of Re
publicans claiming to be actuated by such
motives should set up an independent or
ganization, which would necessarily di
vert some votesâ few or manyâ from the
ranks of those opposed to the bosses. A
conference was therefore had by officers
of the league and of the so-called "Grand
Hotel" movement, and to test the sincer
ity of the latter the directors of the Re
publican Primary League submitted v a
proposition which was not only fair but
most extravagantly liberal.
Notwithstanding the manifest superior
ity of the league in organization; numeri
cal strength and political force, they
tested the loyalty of the officers of the
Grand Hotel movement to the- Republican
party by suggesting the league's willing
ness to add to their eleven directors any
eleven men of the so-called Grand Hotel
movement, and to allow the latter's offi
cers to retain their positions in the new
committee which would thus be created.
No Consolidation Effected.
This proposition being declined, a' coun
ter proposition was made involving the
giving up of both the name and head
quarters, as well as the organization of
:he league, which the league's directors
ndighantly declined, stating, however,
their willingness to meet more than half
way on any fair basis, considering this
advisable merely as a proposition to en
courage all honest Republicans in the idea
that there would be no division in the
ranks. Â¦.. .: Â¦
Further negotiations led to further
propositions. The Grand Hotel people
suggested that each organization appoint
.a committee of five. : the ten so appointed
to select, a committee- "of eighteen, one
from each Assembly "district, the twenty
eight to constitute the "committee of con
trol." This was not satisfactory, but was
acceptable. They further proposed that
the league should abandon its name and
headquarters and that the joint organiza
tion should assume a neutral name and
take neutral headquarters.
These propositions were regarded by the
league directors as preposterous and un
fair in view of the fact that their head
quarters had been leased and rent there
of paid in advance for several months,
but In the interest of harmony even these
absurd propositions, : undoubtedly made
with a view of their non-acceptance by
be league, were agreed to. Thereupon
tie Grand Hotel people asked also that
ieir officers should be the officers of the
)Int organization. The league asked that
the committee of twenty-eight proposed
by the others should elect the officers.
This was refused. The league thereupon
determined not to accede Â¦ to the sugges
tion to abandon headquarters or name
and after giving the Grand. Hotel people
until Friday at midnight to show that
they really desired in good faith to har
monize, the directors of the league de
cided to proceed without further refer
ence to the few men representing the
other so-called organization, fr*
Scarcely a dozen of the original pro
moters of the Grand Hotel anti-boss i
movement of 1899 can be found with the
present club that is masquerading under
the old name. In fact, the existing coterie
which the Republican Primary League
has seen fit to notice is. simply the tag
end of the so-called Citizens' Republican
Association of California, which held a
few meetings in the Mills building two
years ago, but failed to achieve recogni
tion as a Republican organization. It was
really started to promote the interests of
two or three men who were candidates for
office. The politicians who are now trying
to Infuse life into the defunct association
haye a candidate for Sheriff and a candi
date for District Attorney. A half-dozen
well-meaning but misguided anti-boss Re
publicans have been persuaded to join the
_The real founders of the so-called Grand
Hotel movement 1 worked honestly to over
throw boss, rule, but while they were
Â£? + rk v! n & in , t !l e flcid scheming politicians
got hold of the organization, knifed the
Republican municipal ticket, voted for
Phelan, and shamefully betrayed Horace
Davis, the distinguished leader of the
anti-boss forces.
The Republican Primary ; League was
organized to. awaken public interest in the
primary election, to rally the reform
forces and- secure good local government
through^ the agency of the Republican
party. It cannot afford an alliance with
organizations known to be infected with
Phelanism and suspected of having indi
viduals tc- favor in the nominating con
vention. The league is doing good and
should continue its efforts on the lines
already established. The real promoters
and true anti-boss Republicans who were
foremost in the work of establishing thÂ»
original Grand Hotel party are now act
ive supporters of the league.

The Battle of the Bidges.
During the morning the ' .- Second and
Third Brigades were taken out on the pa

and for two hours the rattle of musketry
played a tattoo for the camp. It was a
good drill in all the firings, but it had
mere behind it than the mere use of the
rifle. Very few blank cartridges hadTieen
used In camp, and as a consequence there
were many left that would help to make
the last night exciting. But when the
men returned from the drill blanks were
scarce in camp. They had shot practically
all of them away. There were a few left,

One-Fourth of the Population of
California Is Foreign
Born.
"WASHINGTON, June 22.â The Census
Bureau to-day gave out the first of a
eeries of eleven bulletins giving the popu
lation by sex. general nativity and color
by groups of States and Territories. The
group announced to-day comprises Ala
bama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Cali
fornia, Colorado and Connecticut. In all
these males constitute the larger percent
age of the total population.
In Alaska, which shows the largest dis
proportion of the sexes, the males are
nearly three-quarters, or 72.1 per cent of
the population; in Arizona, 58.1; in Cali
fornia, 55.2; in Colorado, 54.7. There is
only a slight excess of males In Alabama
and Arkansas, while in Connecticut the
population is about evenly divided, the
difference in favor of the males being only
1GS in a total population in 1900 of 908.420.
The foreign born element constitutes
about one-fourth of the population of Cal
ifornia and Connecticut, not quite one
fifth of Alaska and Arizona and a little
more than one-sixth of Colorado's popu
lation. They constitute, however, less
than one per cent in. Alabama and a little
over one per cent in Arkansas.
In Colorado and Connecticut 9S per cent
of the population is white, California al
most 95 per cent, the rest being mostly
Chinese. In Arizona the colored, who are
principally Indians, constitute not quite
one-fourth of the total population, while
the colored element in Arkansas, being al
most wholly persons of negro descent,
constitute 28 per cent of the population.

The- Sixth Regiment struck tents last

to go away to-morrow morning, so every
thing possible in the way, of preparation
was done to-night. The men found time for
a v right merry evening, however, for the
camp was gay with laughter and songs

a double picket line was thrown across
the ridge above and below the camp. The
other battalions formed in the company

Sixth was not going to be taken In any
night attack. The situation was explain

The Seventh Infantry was ready to
strike tents at 11 o'clock. Tent ropes had
all been cast loose and men~ stood .by

win the fourteenth American
Derby at Washington Park track to-day
by one length in 2:33 4-5, record time for
the race. Few in the surging, cheering
throng had backed the comparatively
friendless animal to capture the rich stake
from the horses bf the Eastern and West
ern millionaires, yet never since the day
that the grand filly Modesty took the first
American Derby has the tumultuous
cheeringâ the. ije^uine. ovation .â givenâ to
horse and riderâ beeiv 'equaled in this
State. "Â¦â¢'Â¦'
Jockey Bullman, the Californian, to
whom fell the honor of taking two .Der
bies in succession, was 'swept into a
human maelstrom after he had dismount
ed and verified his weight. He was boost
ed upon the, shoulders of men and a detail
of bluecoats had 'to be called to clear the
admiring. 'cheering throngs from Â¦ the
course. As for the. earnest plebeian rac
ing tool, Robert Waddell, he refused to
permit the attendants to tie upon his back
the gigantic- floral saddle.: that the club
had provided for the winner.'
Terminus, William jT. Shaffer's Blazes
colt, was a good second, while the favor
ite, R. T. Wilson - Jr.'s grand looking
Longstreet colt The Parader was a tired
third. Frank Farrell's Bonnibert, which
shared with Tiie Parader at one time the
honors of /favoritism, failed to' run -his
race and was fourth. His Eminence, pur
chased for $20,000 by Clarence Mackay and
groomed, for a victory in the classic, had
a bad start, but under Jockey Odom's ter
rific riding at the end landed in fifth posi
tion. Sanazarro, Six Shooter, Beau.Gal
lant, Silverdale ami Badie S finished In
the order named behind His Eminence.
Bullman's Services Go Begging.
That.it was a truly run race was the
opinion of every unprejudiced spectator.
The Parader, fast as the wind in the Der
by workout that induced his owner to ship
him from New York .to the .Washington
Park track at the eleventh hour, was sev
enth away at the drop of Starter Dwyer's
red flag, after the field had made one false
break. Piggott had orders to make a kill
ing pace. J He at once took the favorite to
the front and there The Parader remained
until the stretch was reached. Piggott is
a stroneer rider, but he": did not figure
upon all of the problems that. were known
to Jockey John Bullman, who rated his
mount into second place and kept Robert
.Waddell within- striking distance until the
head of, the stretch; -- ; /:
Bullman had been the most disconsolate
person on the big track an hour and a
half; before the. Derby was run. Then it
seemed â¢ to him that he would have ho
mount In the race, although last year,. on
Sidney Lucas, he had won the race. En
gaged to ride Bonnibert. and displaced
when the Eastern owner obtained the ser
vices of Jockey Nash Turner- from Wil
liam C. Whitney, Bullman was discour
aged. Early in the day J. W. . Schorr,
owner of Lady Schorr, engaged him to
pilot the filly, in the mile and a half event.
But the. veterinarian declared against the
starting of this speedy daughter of Esher,
â¢and once more Bullman was ','in the cold,
friends who knew his riding ability work
ed hard to obtain a mount tor him. :. '
Â¦Virginia Bradley was undecided between
Van i_)usen and See for ' the mount on his
entry. He had heard from the poolroom
men that Bullman might notÂ«.try to win.
This decided the quaint Southerner. Call
ing Bulliiian ' an- hour- before the- bugle
summoned the- animals to the post, he
offered $2000 if he would .wlnj with. Robert
Waddell. ' . BuP.man was k - fixed -at - last.
Frank Farrell told him that he could not
straighten theBonr.ibert tangle and ten
dered the jockey 5500 tor. his humiliation.

J "' Bet<idng Is Lively. , ; .,
, There s -were fifty-seven ' bookmakers ' .at

of the public speculation was on the more

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW HAVEN. Conn., June 23.-Adel
bert S. Hay. son of Secretary of State
Hay and former United States Consul to
Pretoria, was found dead on the sidewalk
In front of the New Haven House at 2:30
o'clock this morning.
It is supposed Hay attended a reunion
of college classmates of Yale last night.
There is considerable mystery about his
death and the police are Investigating.
The Chief of Police said that he had ex
amined the room occupied by Hay and
everything was in Its usual condition.
There were no signs of a struggle and the
bed looked as though Hay had just left it.
It Is believed the young man got too
warm during the night and went to the
window for some air. lost his balance and
fell out. He fell from a third story
window and was found lying on the side
walk.
Mr. Hay arrived at the New Haven
House at 6 o'clock last night. At 2 o'clock
this morning a man across the street saw
a body fall out of a window. The man
said he heard no outcry. The body was
not moved for some time after it was
found that Hay was dead as the Chief of
Police wanted to get all the circumstances
connected with the accident, if it were an
accident. There was no indication that
he was sick or was suffering from any in
disposition when he went to his room.
Dr. Bartlett. the medical examiner, who
assisted the police in the investigation,
said that Mr. Hay probably came to his
death by an accident. The clothes on the
bed had been turned, sho-.ving his Inten
tion to go to bed. His clothes had been
folded. On the ledge of the window was
found a partly burned cigarette. This dis
covery leads to the belief that Hay had
lighted a cigarette before retiring and
went to the window to smoke it. Wheth
er he was seized by a, fit of dizziness or
fell asleep on the window ledge cannot be
determined. There are no external inju
ries. /
WASHINGTON", June 23.â Secretary
Hay's bouse was tightly closed and ef
forts to reach him were unavailing to

"Steamboat" Croll is caught asleep at
the switch in every game. Three times in
the present series and ; as many- times in
the Los Angeles series he was . caught
napping. He was given a life yesterday
and was sent to the bench, where he re
ceived a caustic lecture from Uncle Hank.

terday. The millennium Is at hand. Â¦â¢ -
Iburg's slow ball. Is a puzzle to the Oak
land team. They bit at it time and again
yesterday, but fanned the atmosphere.
Â» Dunleavy seemed to have his arm un
hinged. He threw yesterday, with, force
and precision.
The German' outfield had nothing to â¢ do
until the ninth, when Croll and Hilder
brand gathered in one apiece. ;

assists and not an error. . â¢ . ~

"Youngey" Johnson struck ; out . three
times in yesterday's game,.- but" it never
feased him. He took "Ham" Iburg's

revenge.
"Youngey" Johnson is a born comedian.
He affords a large amount of amusement

never pitched a game he would be -alu

sage advice is invaluable - to the men on

Umpire Tyler asks no favors of the
players. He chases after new spheres
and dusts off the plate when neces
sary. His "lamps" were a little bit
foggy in yesterday's game. He called
many balls that should have been strikes.
It is dangerous, however, to give him
"sass," as he has his "fine" clothes on.
Cal Ewlng has at last gathered a great
team together and when the aggregation
becomes better acquainted with each
other the nine should lake a bound pen

- In the ninth the fun began. The Dudes
were having their "last licks." Francks
worked a life and took two sacks - on
.Petey Lohman's two-strike to left. Bab
bitt was put* in to bat for Johnson and
with Tyler's aid took a walk. Graham,
who is usually subdued, blossomed out as
a kicker and lost a part of his salary.
Pabst tried the same dodge and also con
tributed. The crowd was on its pedals
and its lungs were in play. -
Dunleavy hit to Reilly I and Francks
scored. I Lohman either tripped â¢ or inten
tionally balked the third baseman and
the throw to first was too late. Lohman
was forced home by a life given Drennan.
Strelb flew out to . Hildebrand and Bab
bitt beat the . ball home. â¢ Doctor Moski
man failed them at this critical moment.
He hit to Helny Krug and went out at
first. The agony' being over, Uncle Hank
gave a sigh of Teller, and the' crowd went
home to come another day. â¢Â» Following Is
the. score: < , Â¦ Â¦Â¦; ; ' â¢ '-"Â¦. ''- : ;y'
UNCLE HANK'S men won from
the Dudes yesterday, but by a
very narrow margin. The Oak
land nine made a Garrison fin
ish, but was nipped at the wire
by a head. It was a game to rouse the
feelings of any fan. Not an error marred
the sport and the two pitchers succeeded
In keeping: the hits scattered. "Youngey"
Johnson cut capers In the box for the
Dudes and, "Ham" Iburg put them over
for the German band. The comedian was
a trifle wild and allowed many. to walk.
Iburg had wonderful control, but even he
permitted batters to get awa y from him,
and in both instances the bases on balls
proved costly. Umpire Tyler's orbs were
a little awry and I burg 1 -was given the
worst of It on balls and strikes. "Ham"
took it good uaturedly, but Graham and
Captain Pabst argued the point and were
fined aÂ» "V" apiece.
The Dutch scored their first two runs In
tha second. Johnson .could not find the
rubber and Pabst walked. Krug sacri
ficed and Nordyke was hit on the wish
bone and moved to first. Reilly flew out
and Graham was presented with a bag.
With three on bases, Iburg picked i out
ono and sent the ball to right, scoring
Pabst and Nordy.
â¢The Dudes gave-, their opponents a
scare In their half. ThÂ» bases were filled
and "JoshV< Reilly's , clever one-handed
stop saved the day. He threw to second
and caught Francks, who spoiled a double
by jostling Schwartz. The Dutch rolled
up four more as the game progressed and
the visitors were held. down to two tal
lies.. . '

RANCHERS FEAR
* WILD THIEF
Man of Weird Aspect
Terrorizes Monterey
People. *
Special Dispatch to The CalL
MONTEREY, June 22.â Ranchers of the
Su"r district of this county, about forty
miles south of Monterey, have been great
ly disturbed of late over the frequent ap
pearance of a wild man, who frightens
the women 'and children and steals food
from the very pantries of the farmhouses.
During the past few weeks a number of
sheep have been killed and skinned by
him, and portions of .meat from the hind
quarters cut away. Poultry has been
stolen and even provisions from the
houses.
Up to the present time the strange Indi
vidual has not attempted to harm any
one, but. his appearance is so frightful and
his methods so peculiar that the ranchmen
tear, some trouble will result unless he Is
captured. He goes about unclad, except
for a very scant tunic of sheepskin, and
his unkempt hair atad beard fly wildly
about as he .runs. He appears at all
hours of the day and night, but never
takes anything except food. He never
speaks, and if spoken to or approached he
disaorears with marvelous fleetness Into
the Wush. .-Â¦-' â¢Â¦
He was seen last week by Mrs. Barondo,
the wife of one of the Sur ranchers, stand
ing near her chicken house. Mrs. Barondo
saw him before he discovered he was be
ing watched and she was able to observe
his appearance more in detail than had
been done heretofore. She states that she
noticed a broad plain gold ring on a finger
of the skinny, dirty hand of the recluse,
but that otherwise there were no traces
of civilization about him.
Nothing is known of this mysterious
man except that he has appeared at In
tervals in the Sur country and" sometimes
as far north as the Carmel for the past
two years.
He Is seen less often during the winter
than in the summer months. Officers have
made repeated efforts to capture him, but
his fleetness of foot and extreme, cun
ning in putting his pursuers oft his trail
have always saved him. Attempts have
even been mads to take him with a lariat,
but these also have failed. The resMents
of the district where he roams believe
him to be a lunatic and great anxiety is
felt over what may occur unless he Is
soon captured and placed in confinement.

charged private of the same command, Is
held at the City Prison until the detectives
have comp.cted their Investigation of the
manner in which Slattery came to his
death to-night at 7:30 o'clock In a room
at the Avenue House, 129 San Pablo ave
nue.
Daley's story Is that his companion shot
himself ! In the head with a pistol while
sitting : in a chair, in the apartment the
two men had rented for the night an hour
before the shooting. Daley declares he
was lying ln a semi-stupor on a sofa Â»-i
poslte Slattery and knew nothing of ..the
suicidal Â¦ shooting- until he was aroused
by the shot, and awoke half dazed to find
the room full of smoke, his friend with
a bullet hole in his fprehead, and a pistol
lying on the floor by the chair.
Slattery and Daley came from Maiden.
Mass. Slattery's discharge, under the
name of Edwin Kelley, shows he is 30
years old. a native of Boston. He had $277
when he left camp. The Coroner found $3
or $4 . and some papers on his person.
These were addresses of "William C.
Morss, 741 Howard street, San Francisco:
William Connors, Vallejo, and Joseph
Shaughnesay, driver "Winchester Hotel.
The detectives say that it looks like sui
cide. The attempt of Daley to leave the
house and his explanation of the presence
of the pistol on a table six or eisht feet
from the suicide are the principal points
under investigation. No . surface motive
for murder appears.

ted that she had signed this document,
but explained that she had done so to pro
tect herself during " a recent financial
trouble and that the bill of sale had since
been canceled. The j case was not con
cluded.
Â¦ The first witness put on the stand by the
prosecution was Mrs. de Lambert and
early in the examination the defense of
fered In evidence what purported to be a
bill of sale - of the pictures from her to
Thomas for $250 each. The paper was
shown to Mrs. de Lambert and after read
ing its contents she " involuntarily raised
her right hand and said: "1 swear this

At the suggestion of Lawyer Daney, for
the defense, Mrs. de Lambert wrote her

nature on the alleged bill of sale. Attor
ney J. S. Callen was called as an expert
on handwriting and he pronounced the
signature on the alleged bill of sale to be

zon, June 22. â In the course of an inter
view to-day General Cailles, the insurgent
commander, whose surrender is promised
for Monday, and who is now established
in the former American headquarters at
Pagsanjan, said he was convinced of the
wisdom of surrender and was satisfied of
the liberal intentions of the American au
thorities. The town is full of armed and
uniformed insurgents.
Colonel Caballes, with 120 of Cailles'
command, fled to the mountains this
morning, being frightened by a rumor
that Geronimo and others were to be
hanged. Cailles sent a detachment in pur
suit of them and avers that they will re
turn to-morrow.
He asserts that he will bring more than
600 rifles to Santa Cruz on Monday, with
ten men for every rifle, and declares that
the thirty dollars received for each rifle
will be given to the widows and orphans.
General Cailles declines to be a candi

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, June 22.
Mrs. Josephine Wallace Dunsmuir,
widow of Alexander Dunsmuir and
mother of Edna Wallace Hopper, the
actress, passed away this afternoon at 1
o'clock, after an illness of ' two weeks,
from typhoid fever. Death occurred at
Mrs. Dunsmuir's beautiful country resi
dence, formerly the Souther farm, near
San Leandro.
Mrs. Dunsmuir had been critically 111
for a week. When the sickness took a
serious turn, her daughter, who was play-
Ing an engagement in New York, was
summoned by telegraph, and Is expected
to arrive here Monday. Telegrams an
nouncing Mrs. Dunsmuir's death have
been sent to Miss Hopper en route. The
attendants at the Dunsmuir home had
made a strong effort to keep the news of
Mrs. Dunsmuir's death quiet, ln order
that the daughter who is hastening home
might not receive too great a shock from
the sudden intelligence which would reach
her through the newspapers.
Dr. W. S. Thome, who was Mrs. Duns
muir's physician for many years, was
called to the San Leandro home when
Mrs. Dunsmuir was first taken sick. A
corps of trained nurses was also sum
moned and for days there has been a
hard fight to save the life of the patient,
but in vain. During the last week Mrs.
Dunsmuir failed rapidly, until her . con
dition became so critical that the attend
ing physician was compelled to give up
hope for her recovery, although for sev
eral days Dr. Thome remained constant
ly at the bedside of his patient..
Nothing will be done concerning: the
funeral arrangements until after Miss
Hopper's arrival.
Mrs. Dunsmuir went East some time
ago to visit with her daughter. She re
turned here two months and a half ago,
and had been in ill health ever since.
Mrs. Dunsmuir had resided at the Souther
farm for several years. The place had
been purchased during the lifetime of
Alexander Dunsmuir. The farm, noted for
its natural attractions, was rendered
doubly beautiful by the expenditure of a
fortune in improvements. A palatial
colonial residence was erected for Mrs.
Dunsmuir and her daughter, and all of
the luxuries that money could lavish upon
the grounds were installed for their com
fort and pleasure.
The secret of Mrs. Dunsmuir's wifehood
â¢was kept until after the coal baron's
death in New York about two years ago.
Then it developed that he had left a
widow who was the mother of 'dainty
Kdna Wallace Hopper. Mrs. Dunsmuir's
first husband was Waller Wallace, who
was head usher at the old California
Theater when John McCullough and Law
rence Barrett starred there. Wallace and
his dainty Dresden-like beauty did not
agree. After their divorce Mrs. Wallace
took charge of her daughter, Edna. For
a time mother and daughter resided in
Oakland, where the young girl was a
student at Miss BIsbee's school in East
Oakland. Dunsmuir met and wedded the
mother, ana he provided most liberally for
her, as well as for the daughter, who was
given all of the advantages of education.

The dancers remained on the floor revel

The music was furnished free by the

their services to handle the refreshments.
It is expected that the dance netted

managed the affair were:

ing. J. Desmond. W. Stewart and M. Casey.
There have been no new developments
in the relations between the strikers and
employers. Rumors were rife to the effect
that the Union Iron -Works would capiiu
iate to-morrow and grant the ironworkers
their demands. These rumors could not
Sowever, be traced to a reliable source.
Sacretary Rosenberg of the Labor Coun
cil, when questioned about the rumor,
said he knew nothing about it.
The cooks and waiters still maintain
that their battle is a winning one. The
men on strike fear, however, that the re
tail butchers will refuse to serve meat to
the "fair" restaurants, thus placing them
between two fires. President Lane of the

At the time of the horse show the asso

Owing to the high standing of the men

hair and dark ej-es, forming a rather un
usual type of beauty. Miss Curtiss is very
popular, both here and in Sacramento,

sively last winter. Her artistic work with
both pen and brush has attracted a great
deal of. attention, particularly her sketches
in water color of dancing girls.

HOUSE OF LORDS
TO TRY RUSSELL
Nevada Official Gives
Testimony Against
the Earl. *
& >~
LONDON, June 22.â Earl Russell reap
peared In the Bow-street Police Court to
day on the charge of bigamy and was
committed for trial. The court was
crowded. Among those present was the
woman (Mrs. Somerville) who, the Earl
claims, Is his wife and to whom he was
married In Reno, Nev., In 1900, after he
had obtained a divorce from his first wife.
The register of his first marriage was
produced. Mr. Brown, Assistant Director
of Public Prosecutions, then testified that
the present proceedings were taken by tha
Public Pro3ecutor independently of any
other person, confirming the first Count
ess' statement that she Is not a party to
the suit. |
Mr. Brown gave details of his Investiga
tion at i Reno, and B. P. Curler, County
Judge of Washoe County, Nevada, testi
fied to having married Earl Russell and
Mrs. Somerville at the Riverside Hotel In
Reno. The defendant called himself Mr.
'Russell, and the witness was not aware
of his rank.
After detailing, the Nevada law on di
vorce Mr. Curler said that In Earl Rus
sell's divorce the law . was not complied
with in two respects, and therefore the
decree annulling the Earl's marriage was
not valid even in Nevada.
After counsel had protested that Earl
Russell had not been given adequate time
to prepare his defense the Earl was com
mitted for trjal at the next session of the
Central Criminal Court, the same ball
(Â£2000) being allowed.
It appears that the Earl must be tried
as a Peer In the House of Lords. The
usual course is that, after the committal,
an application is made to remove the case
to the House of Lords by writ of cer
tlorarl./ Such trials have been very rare.
The last was the case of Lord Cardigan.
There have been four trials of Peers in
the House of Lords since the end of the)
reign of George II. Â¦

Three years have elapsed since Mr.
Peary left America, - and two - full sea
sons' work Is to be learned upon the re
turn of the Eric. . More Interesting In a
personal and dramatic way than the geo
graphical work of Mr. Peary is the fate
of his wife and daughter and the steamer
Windward, from which nothlnr has been
heard since her departure from God
haven, . Greenland, . August 20, . 1900. Ex
pectations and Instructions then .were
that the Windward, with Mrs. Peary and
Miss Peary," would return in the autumn,
and the hope now Is that their detention
was due to Mr. Peary's orders and rea
sons which were satisfactory to him.
The Eric will take stores for one year,
to guard against- any possible. detention,
and will, with authority from the Royal
Greenland Trading Company to land, call
at the most northern station for any pos-
Blble Information of Peary. The summer
of 1901 is likely to mark the culmination of
the work of the. Peary Club, though :lts

from the outset in Mr. Peary's success,

usual, perfect and elicited many words of
comment from the visitors present. For
the first time the chapter used new chairs
prepared expressly Â¦ for the five points.
These, in addition to the new pillars used
in the work, added much to the beauty, of
the ceremony of initiation. The new
chairs differ from those used in other
chapters in that they are hand carv
ed, covered with gold leaf highly bur
nished and the seat of each is of silk vel
vet of the color of the point at which it
is used. Ib the center of each seat there
is worked In silk the emblem of the point
of the star. The emblems are the handi
work of- Sister. Sophia Frank of San Le

admired and Is the talk of many Eastern
Star members and Masons. After the
of the evening there was a
[social hour in the banquet hall. This
chapter, although the last instituted in

MONTEZUMAâ COPPERâ COALâ COKE.
"Why do you advertise Monteruma stock so
xnuchr' is a question frequently asked. We
reply In a nutshell: Because It Is profitable.
And it is profitable only because the stock has
merit. Having merit, we wi6h the public to
know It; and that can be accomplished only
by presenting to them the facts concerning the
great Montezuma Copper and Coal Mines. It
Â¦was Lincoln who said, "You can fool some of
the people all the time and all the people
some of the time, but you can't fool all the
people all the time." Rest assured that if
Montezuma stock lacked merit all the adver-
tising we might do would not make the hosts
of friends the company has gained In Califor-
nia. The Montezuma mines have been exam-
ined by shareholders, to their entire Eatlsf ac-
tion. It offers safe and profitable Investment,
as is being constantly proven by Interested
persons. Price, 12c cash or 14c Installments

The "officer of- the day" on the battle
ship "Wisconsin caused a number of boys
to be very much disappointed yesterday.
Mrs. Peterson asked Captain Reiter for
permission to show the choir boys of St.
Peter's Church and me Good Samaritan
Mission over the battleship, and it was
granted. The boys gathered at the foot of
Folsom-street and were sent out in
launches, but when they got alongside the
officer of the day refused to allow them.
on board. Of course there was some mis
understanding, but that did not lighten
the disappointment of the boys. Mrs.
Peterson had a nice lunch for them, how
ever, and that compensated In a manner
for their failure to see the battleship.

on that vessel for a couple of days. Nearly
all the men are "time expired," and last
Thursday thirteen of them arranged to
go East. They gave their railroad .ticket*
to Carmody and he came ashore to attend
to their baggage and other matters. Tha
last seen of the master at arms was when
he went into a saloon on the front to have
a drink. After waiting two days the men
went to the ticket office and the agent at
once canceled the old tickets and issued
new ones, so the men got away for home
yesterday. Carmody is still among the
missing and some of his friends think he
may have been shanghaied on an outgoing
merchantman.

who will be carefully selected for thosa
offices which will devolve upon them to
perform. A sub-committee consisting of
several hundred young people will act aa
aids and look after details connected with
this immense labor.
As soon as the visitors arrive their
wants will be consulted and they will
then be guided about the city by members
of the Â¦ reception committee. In addition
to what will be done in San Francisco,
"train sections'* are to be orsanized in
Sacramento, Fresno and San Jose to board
the incoming trains and get acquainted so
far as possible with the desires of the
delegates and then to wire on to this city
so that preparations may be made accord-
Throughout the convention the membÂ«rÂ»

NEW TORK, June 22.â To-day*B stock mar
ket was an inconsequential affair and even the
professional trading, of which lt was wholly
made up, vras narrow and restricted. The
trading, euch as lt was, turned on the bank
statement. An inkling was obtained soon after
the opeulnr that the expected favorable fea
tures would not be forthcoming, and the trad
ers eoW the market. 2>ut when their views were
verified by the bank statement, the market
proved too narrow to reflect any action by out
ride holderB. and the covering by professional
beers rallied prices. They went oil again to
the lowest >n some cases, while a few upward
movements gave the cloelng 1U irregular tone.
The moet disappointing feature of the state
ment was its failure to show any of the ex
pected payments of large corporate loanr. If
any of these were paid oti during the week
there was eufScient new borrowing to offset
this, as the loan Item shows a slight expansion,
not threatening ln itself, but disappointing ln
view of expectations. The change in cash re
serve shows a discrepancy of fully $4,000,000
from that foreshadowed by the known move
ments of money. The consequence is a loss
cf K.EOO.OOO Instead of the expected ea |n ot
tl Â£00 000 The surplus reserves are in conse
quence carried below J7.000.0CO. This would
eeera to call for greater effect upon money rates
than has been shown. Chicago banks, however,
have placed large eums in loans ln the New
York market within the last day or two, thus,
keeping the tone easier. St. Paul and Union
Pacific sold down to the . lowest In the final
dealings at 1*Â©1% under last nlgbt. New
York Central Â«nd the local tractions were well
sustained by buying of the same character as
that recently prevailing. Long Island Jumped

cate by tunne! with the center of New York.
International Silver preferred was marked up
7 points on licht dealings.
The stock market this week has shown a pro
gressive decrease In epeculatlve interest and
activity, the dealings for a ful! day having
fallen below the ha If -mill ion share mark for
the Cm time since thÂ« first week In November

CHICAGO, June 22.â Everything combined to
create a decided weakness ln the wheat pit
and the opening 'was weak and lower. The
fine crop prospects with lower cables discour
aged holders and as a result considerable long
wheat came out, but at declines of from Ho to
He shorts attempted to cover and take prof
its, but there was little for sale, and . prices
rallied. The. advance was well maintained
throughout the day, the market holctng steady.
One of the chief - bull Influences was the
strength ln corn. September opened Ko to He
lower at 66U@66*sC. Under free selling by com
mission houses and locals the price dropped to
66!4c, around which figure shorts covered, ad
vancing the market to. 67c. A steady feeling
prevailed around these figures and the close
was He lower at 66*ic. s
Weakness was â¢ noticeable ln the corn - pit
early, '.due chiefly' to thâ¬ weakness In wheat.
Offerings ' were heavy^or a short time and
were quickly absorbed by. shorts, which ad
vanced the price and gave a strong feeling to
the market. September closed with an ad
vance of %Â®9ic at 44%c. Â¦ â¢ ' . . :
Oats opened weak with other cereals, . and
there was sufficient liquidation to prevent a
corresponding advance. There was no special
feature to the trade. September closed %@%o
hlBlier at 26V4@26%c. ' . . -
There was very little interest . manifested in
provisions, all eyes being apparently on the
grain market. Opening was steady with some
commission house buying of lard. Light re
ceipts of hogs doubtless was the main strength
ening factor. September pork closed at an ad
vance Of V/ic at $14 92%; lard closed 10c higher
at $8 75 and ribs 5@7V4c higher at $8 12#.

A feature of the week has been the moderat
ing of views regarding future railroad combi
nations and consolidations. It is not improb
able that this present result of the check on
speculation was exerted by ; the money market
situation. - Whatever may be the actual' develop
ments looking toward railroad consolidations.
It is evident that speculators have taken ad
vantage of conditions to violently manipulate
the stocks supposed to be concerned and to
circulate greatly exaggerated reports of the
plans Intended. With the restricted supply of
loanable funds with which the manipulators
might operate there has been a significant fall-
Ing off in the number and character of these
rumors and a more conservative Ispirlt of in
vestment has prevailed, which has resulted In
the discrediting of Eome of the more extrava
gant rumors lately afloat. A factor making
toward this more conservative view was the
adjournment of the directors of the Missouri
Pacific last Monday without any ac
tion on the Greater Missouri Pacific
merger project which was confidently
predicted by bull speculators and long made
a potent Instrument for advancing prices. The
versions of the so-called St. Paul deal have
been materially modified in the gossip of the
street from earlier circumstantial reports of
an Intended exchange of the stock for jointly
guaranteed 4 per cent bonds at the rate of 100
par value of stock for 200 par value of bonds.
The first revised version had it that Union
Paciflo was acquiring large blocks of St. Paul
stock to effect, an extension of community of
Interest, but that no further interchange of
securities or transfer of control of railroad
property was contemplated In the process of
extracting the Northwestern and the Pacific
Railway problem from the disputes precipitated
by the Northern Pacific contest. When specu
lation was at the low ebb it was allowed to be
possible that the settlement involved simply
an agreement or understanding between the
railroad owners and that no changes of owner-
Ehlp were to be made. Â¦ None of these versions
has any official sanction, but each has its In
fluence in the market movement of stocks in
volved- While the Immediate condition of the
speculation is thus one of repression, the
undertone Is confident. The promise of a heavy
wheat crop, the continued large demand for
cotton, the maintenance of activity in the Iron
and steel Industry,' the undlminished profits of
our foreign trade, the I unprecedented level of
earnings, the prospect that large distributions
of dividends and interest seeking reinvestment
and mpre remotely the receipts of Klondike
gold eoon to be Inaugurated, and the possibility
of renewed production of gold in South Africa
are all Interested in the sum total of confidence
in the future which underlies the speculative
market. â¢ .
The market for railway bonds has been rather
quiet except for some of the speculative issues
which have been in demand. * Â¦Â¦

pressure, and have yielded when speculative
liquidation was attempted and when profes
sional bears attempted an attack. What specu
lative operations there were were shifted into
the less conspicuous stocks of minor railroad
systems and industrials, and the causes alleged
to explain these movements were special to the
frtocks affected that their advance had little
sympathetic effect on the general list. Some
of them were 'probably due to manipulation
and were followed by collapses commensurate
with the sensational advances. The wide and
rcverirh fluctuations In this class of stocks
ratter tended to discourage operations and to
arouse uneasiness, but the deep underlying fac
tor in checking active operations was the con
cition of the local money market. When the
bank statement of last Saturday was followed
en Monday by the announcement that $4,000,000
In cold had .been feugaged for shipment for
Germany it became \ question of simple arlth
"ifV 0 t0 PÂ«> v e any large demands for loans
with which to speculate in stocks would devel
op stringency and precipitate liquidation of
stocks, thus defeating its own purpose. It was
then that there was a hardening of money,
both on time and call. Rates did not rise so
hlirh as to create any actual distress, but quite
mgh enough to serve as a warning against
indiscreet expansion of credits. With the sail
ing of Thursday's steamer for Germany it was
felt that the outward gold movement was ter
minated, as that was the latest day on which
ships could arrive In Berlin to be In time for
the July settlement, which was . the purpose
or the movement. But the money market was
still confronted by the semi-annual require
ments here, which almost Invariably make an
active money market In the lart week of June.
The disbursements of dividends and interest
on the approaching first of July will be the
largest In the history of the country as a re
sult of prosperous conditions ruling and the
l&rsre profits to be distributed to holders of all
eoru of Becurltiei. Current estimates make the
amount of money to be distributed $i;o,000,000 to
$115,000,000. Included In the amount will be a
t-eml-annual dividend of 24 per cent on Missouri
Pacific In accordance with the decision of the
directors of the company on Monday. Thl? Is
the first dividend paid on the stock since 1831.
when * Per cent was paid. The stock sold at
124 last week, but has, since shown the effect
of realizing. On May 6, 1S97, the stock sold
at l&S on the New York Stock Exchange. The
property's earning power at present, together
with these flmires, constitute a marvelous ex
hibition of the recuperation of the railroad
business of the country in general and the
Southwestern region in particular.

LONDON. June 22.â Money was . distinctly
harder and not abundant to-day. The demand
was fairly good. Discounts were firm.
The attendance on the exchanges was small
and there was little doing. Gilt edge securi
ties were overshadowed by the expected large
new borrowing., Americans Improved in sym
pathy with New York's closing of yesterday
opening above parity and closing firm and
quiet. The changes were generally slight.
Grand Trunks were harder, especially becond
preferred. The approach of the half year end
is beginning to be felt. Money will probably
be more wanted next week, owing to the set
tlement and the usual half year demand.
Commenting on the abnormal" circumstances
governing the course of the exchange between
America and Europe and the fact that gold- is
shipped from New York in spite of the fact
that the trade balance is greatly in favor "of
the United States when, under normal condlt
tlons, shipments would be made fromEurope
the Statist conclude*: ..
: "The high American exchange Â¦ of the past
two or three weeks is due to the fact that the
railroad . " and other â¢ corporations who , have
financed operations, partly by means of money
borrowed in Europe, have now marketed their
securities with the American public and ' are
in a position to pay off i the loans obtained in
Europe. How- soon the .whole will be repaid it
is 'difficult to determine,' but, in view of ; the
Lo: don Money Market.
WASHINGTON, June 22.â To-day's state

Condition of the Treasury.
Associated Banks for the week ending to-day
shows:
Increase Decrease
Loans $902,755,300 $1,881,400
Deposits' 982,844.200 $1,350,000
Circulation 30,887.500 16,900

Reserve required.. 245,711,050 ; 337,525
Eurplus 6,611,330 2,170,775
The Financier says: The bank statement of
last week reflects in the loss of $2,508,300 cash
the average of the $5,000,000 exports of gold to
Europe during the past week, and at the same
time it fails fully to record the net movement
of money to New York from the interior, which
movement was disclosed by the returns made*
by the principal banks of receipts through ex
press companies. Hence the statement in this
respect may be said to be out of harmony with
the facts as shown by the known movement of
money â a condition which It may be noted has
been exhibited at least for the past three weeks.
The gain of only $1,811,400 In loans, following
the recent large increases In this item would
seem to indicate that the syndicate operations
which have greatly â¢ contributed to the expan
sion in loans are, temporarily at least, at an
end. There were large liquidations of loans re
ported to have been made during the week by
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. If this
statement Is true there must have been a con
siderable amount of new loans to have coun
teracted the above noted liquidation and con
tributed to the increase shown by. the state
ment. The loss of $1,350,100 In deposits agrees
with . the decrease in cash, less the gain in
loans, and hence the item is harmonious. The
loss of $2,170,775 In surplus reserve carries this
item to $6,661,330 or only $793,375 above the low
est point of the year, which point was recorded
April 6. With this comparatively low surplus
reserve and with the preparations for the dis
bursement of a larger amount of July Interest
than has ever been paid at this center, which
preparations will probably begin by Thursday,
It is difficult to see how money on call at the
Stock Exchange can be otherwise than active
during the current week. At the same time it
should be remembered that until the money col
lected for disbursement shall be required the
banks and other institutions with whom 'it Is
temporarily deposited will freely loan it on call
until the day when it will be needed to be
checked out for payment, when the loans will
be called in. Moreover, though the amount of
July Interest and dividend payments is Â¦ un
preccdentedly large, only a portion of it will be
paid out ;m July 1, and while the remainder Is
being disbursed that portion which was earlier
paid will be In, course or distribution. Conse
quently the disturbance to money will be onlv
temporary. , *

CLOSING
' The stock-market was stagnant but v steady,
with American Â¦ shares . somewhat - uncertain.
New York's "higher prices induced some profit
taking, with the result that quotations dropped
slightly under parity. When this selling move
ment ceased the tone hardened and the close
was firm and a shade above parity. . The fea
tures were Union Pacific and Southern Pacific
NEW YORK. June 22.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial . cablegram says: [
London Market.
The Bank of ' England's .report, shows that
the reserve and holding of Â¦ bullion totals lour
millions more than a year ago, ;. This will con
siderably, decline 'during the next few weeks,
in consequence i of .the usual': outflow to the
country In connection with ' the holidays. The
holiday requirements will I probably be three
and a. half millions. , An early advance in the
bank rate is improbable.' Unless the reserve
reaches twenty millions. It is not likely there
will be an advance Until autumn, when the
demand for gold In the United States and on
the Continent ' may necessitate, a 4 per cent
rate. 'Â¦-,â¢, '. ' â¢'Â¦.'Â¦
Immense trade â¢ balance, ' the" process should not
be lengthy. .. Moreover, in view of .the cheap
ness of money in : London, Parti and .Berlin;
greater eagerness may presently 2 be , shown Â¦ to
continue - the .loans, when -the, amount is re
duced. Consequently, 'should money in. New

The contest over the Johnson estate was
a celebrated case in the San Joaquin Val

Falling to arouse Howell and being un
able to gain an entrance to his room the
officers broke down the door. Lying on

body, was Howell. The room was flhed
with gas that flowed from two burners.
Howell was ln an almost unconscious con

locked up on a charge of drunkenness.
After being released yesterday morning

Howell. before leaving the prison, de

Howell was one of the best known men
ln the San Joaquin Valley at one time.
For years he was a merchant in Modesto,
Stanislaus County. He married the
adopted daughter of a farmer named
Johnson of San Joaquin County, who was
worth more than half a million 'dollars.
Upon Johnson's death no will was found
and the adopted daughter secured the
bulk of the big estate after a desperate
court battle ln which ex-Governor Budd
took a prominent part.

Julius Raphael, president of the Ra

to be of the greatest importance to the
Industries of California. What this busi

Mr. Raphael admits that his mission ls

Chairman Brandensteln favored the re
jection of bids not accompanied by a
sufficient check. This action would throw
out the proposals of Phillips & Smyth,
Valleau & Peterson, the Commercial Pub
lishing Company and P. N. Steuart.
Comte agreed with Brandenstein that the
checks should equal 10 per cent of the ag
gregate . amount called for ln the pro
posals and not 10 per cent of the amounts
required by the ; various departments, as
had been the custom in the past. Comte,
however, held that the bidders had bid in
good faith and had further agreed to file
a bond for the proper carrying out of the
contract. He favored this course, but
Brandensteln would not agree to it. The
dispute between the printing firms will be
taken up at th,e board's meeting to-mor
row. .
The Judiciary Committee of the Board
of Supervisors decided yesterday that four
printing firms who had subniitted bids
for furnishing printed forms and blanks
to various departments, officers and of
fices of the municipality had neglected to
file certified checks covering 10 per cent
of the estimated amount of printing called
for Jn the proposals invited. The commit
tee further found that the charter makes
it mandatory that the checks shall be
for 10 per cent of the total amount The
committee, however, referred the ques
tion back to the board without recommen
dation, as It was divided on the question
of rejecting all bids and readvertlslng
again. If the charter ls obeyed the course
indicated must be followed.
