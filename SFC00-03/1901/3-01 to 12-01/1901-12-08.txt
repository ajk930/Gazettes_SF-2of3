].F good manners are .expected of.chll
"*dren , they must be treated cour
teously. They should be taught that
consideration for others underlies
genuine courtesy. Mere manners may
treacherously desert one at critical mo
ments, but. true politeness may be re
lied upon.
To talk of children in their presence
makes them self-conscious and robs them
of the simplicity that Js their greatest
charm â "klngdom-of-heavenltes," Cole
ridge calls them.
The least shade of impertinence or dis
respect should be checked promptly and
sharply. American parents are not con
sidered good disciplinarians. An English
man once- jestingly remarked, "In the
States parents are sent to bed for 'an
swering back!' "
Children v who are not obliged to be po
lite to their elders and to one another
will not suddenly become well-bred when
strangers are present. They should not
take the mest comfortable seats or most
advantageous ppaltlons, but be observing
and offer such little attentions to their
parents and elders, and the boys to their
plsters.
Such attentions should also be acknowl
edged with courteous appreciation. A
home may have the elegance of high
breeding, no matter how elmple the sur
roundings. Children should not be al
lowed to contradict each other, but be
early taught to use the same courtesy in
expressing differences of opinion as do
their eldersâ "I beg your pardon" or "I
am sure that you are mistaken." It i.s all
a mutter of habit; but the outward form
often compels the Inward feeling. They
should be made to understand, too, that
their unsold ltdl opinions or r advice of-

fered to their elders is a rudeness that
will make them unpopular. " :
It used to be the custom for children to
say "Yes, ma'am," "Noi sir," to their
elders, but that is now considered to bs
long to the courtesy, due from servants,
and well bred children say, "Yes, mam
ma,", "No, grandpapa," and the tone of
polite deference must underlie the simple
"Yes" and "No" when unaccompanied by
the name of the person addressed.
Well-bred children do, not pass in front
of a person without an apology, or enter
a room whistling, or addressing some one
therein, unobservant of the conversation
that may be in progress.
In the Presence cf Visitors.
Young people should .rise whenever a
visitor comes into or takes leave of the
family circle/ and also if addressed else
where by an older person, should they
happen to be seated.
In France young girls are trained in
winsome, attractive manners. They are
careful to stand aside to permit their eld
ers to pass first. They do not sit while
any one of them Is standing, "and their
polite deference in conversation pays them
a pretty compliment. It was for a French
woman that the word "charming" was
invented.
Children should not be forward in claim
ing the attention of friends or visitors
when they are being greeted by the elder
members of the family, neither should one
hold out a reluctant hand under parental
coercion. Shyness Is only less unattract
ive than forwardness, and is due generally
to ignorance of what is expected of one.
Should a child enter the room where the
mother is entertaining a visitor to ask a
question oc favor he or she should stand
by the mother's side, without speaking,
until addressed by or presented, to the
stranger. Then, after asking permission
to prefer the request, it is made, and the
child withdraws, after taking courteous
leave of the guest.
We all feel that It is humiliating to have
the attention of others directed to our
shortcomings and children are not less
sensitive, but some mothers do not seem
ETIQUETTE
to know that they are breaking all the
laws of good taste in correcting a child
before a guest. It is as annoying to the
visitor as It Is cruel to the child, making
him awkward and self-conscious, if noth
ing â¢worse. The time is ill-chosen for child
training.- Any possible conflict or clash
of wills between parent and child should
be anticipated in time and the little one
tactfully withdrawn before any 'unseemly
friction becomes apparent to the visitor.
'. "Showing off" children is an unconscious
injustice to them. Let a mother keep to
herself, for private delectation, the knowl
edge that her child is a prodigy/, â 
A Well-Trained Boy^
LÂ»et a boy be as free as air out of doors,
but in the house demand that he behave
like a 'gentleman. In medieval times
lads were, made pages to courtly dames
for such training.
It is not^' however, the province of the
entire family, to bring him up. "Nagging"
Is one of "the small foes to the >peace of
a household, but the teaching of boys to"
be gentlemen at home is as essential 'as
the training of them ' to ' be men in ' the
world. â '.:.;â¢. ,:.'' :; â â . â '.,. ._.'.<-..â¢â¢â ; ,:.. : .
When: physical ;. strength begins to be
realized by 'a boy. his first idea is touse
it solely as a power. He must be taught
to regard it also as c responsibility. His
strength inclines a truly manly man. to
gentleness toward those who tire weaker.
"Noblesse oblige." A' tactful mother. will
make much, of a lad's strength, appearing
a little dependentupon it. . â . â â¢ , -*â¢ â  < '
A boy accompanying his mother or sis
ters inf the street should be taught to
raise his. hat when they return a bow or
meet a. friend;-' or when '.alone the boy
passes an acquaintance of his own or of
the family, he should show the same cour
tesy, unless in the case of a fellow lad
or a young man, when a bow or , nod
suffices.
The old adage. "Children should be seen
and not heard," has not been supersed
ed by a better, however unpopular with
the present generation. It would spare
mal-apropos r remarks until the child
were old. enough to recognize when to
speak, and when to be silent.'
Boys early learn sportsman's etiquette,
to accept defeat uncomplainingly, to show
no favoritism in playing games, and to
keep one's temper, but girls are some
times offenders in these things.
Unless self-government is taught, pa
rental training- is imperfect.
Imposing Self -Control.
âA look should be sufficient to restrain
a child in public if he or she has been
properly Instructed behind the scenes.
Especially when guests _ are present it is
unseemly for there to be any protest on
the , child's part against the parent's*
â wishes, expressed by word or look.
At air times "No" should be irrevocable
when uttered; but a conscientious review
of the situation should first be made, in
strict Justice to the* little beings who are
so entirely dependent for happiness. A
"teasing" child is merely a victim of bad
management.
A wholesome - self-restraint about an
noying trifles la imposed by good man
ners. Fretting: about the weather or a
disappointment, fussing about what can
not be cured, poisons the atmosphere like
a miasma. â¢' .
The practice of allowing a sick child to
be as cross, petulant, and exacting as his
humor dictates is an injustice to the child,
who should be taught that under no cir
cumstances may one remit the effort at
self-control. The Injunction should be
pressed with loving firmness, -v.
Children should be early instructed in
behavior at table. No amount of tiub.se:
quent drilling quite atones for early neg
lect.
All corrections should, however, be
made in such a manor as not to attract
the attention of others. At the family
meeting-place nothing should be allowed
to overshadow the general pleasantness.
Kvery-day etiquette includes the custom
of cheerful daily greetings. When a
grunt does duty for a a pleasant "good
morning" and inaudible murmur replaces
a tender "good-night," family manners
need mending. ..'.,â 
People should never be criticised ad
versely in the presence of children.
A look should be sufficient to restrain a
child from eating some coveted dainty at
table. If children were made to feel that
their parents denied themselves? a pleas
ure in denying them their wishes, and
that only their best judgment guided by
tenderest love prompted the refusal of
what they would be. far happier to grani,
there would be more trust and less fric
tion between parents and children. "'â â¢"
In no one thing does the good and bad
training of early life so quickly betray
itself as, in the treatment of those whom
circumstances have placed in dependent
positions. The higher the nature the more
strongly is felt the inarticulate appeal
from the less-favored classes for . justice
and gentleness.
Children should not be thrown in the
society of servants for companionship
more than necessary, but they should be
required to treat them with courteous con
sideration, prefacing every request with
"please," and ready with pleasant thanks
In acknowledgment of anyv service.
Among influences that mold and re
fine the young persons of the household
is the informal and frequent entertain
ment of welcome guests. Those ac
customed to the, presence of visitors have*
more pleasing manners, are more at thelij
ease, and consequently more graceful and
tactful than those who have not this ad
vantage.
Entertaining visitors unifies a family, all
being pledged to the same object, the
gratification of theTJuest.
.Children should be made to feel their
identification with the home. A little fel
low replied to th,e question whether he had
any brothers and sisters, "No, we have
only one child."
Social observance requires no effort if
one' learns it in early youth. A child
should be encouraged to write his or her
own note of thanks for a pleasure offered
or a present received. However, childish
ly expressed, it will probably thank the
giver better than most correct effusions
written by an elder.
- Should a ehild;bf one household have a
quarrel with another, the mothers show a,
petty spirit in adopting it themselves.
The difference should be carefully look
ed into, and the children urged to apolo
gize and "make up." The one who is
most forward to take the initiative has
usually the finer instincts. Should a
mother learn that her child has been
guilty of some grave fault toward an-i,
other, she should call at once with her^
child upon the one who has been injured,/
and make her child apologize, expressing,
her own regret and offering to make any
reparation in her power. She should be
met in a generous and forgiving spirit.
The rule works goth ways.
5 No woman should ever presume to scold
or correct the child of another, rtur should
she be. the one to report its misdeeds.
A' school girl's dress should be plain,
neat and calculated to excite no envy, at
tract no attention. Simplicity Is not only
in good taste, but it is the characteristic
of a little maiden's costume among thoso
â¢who set a fashion by adopting it. Chil
dren should be as unconscious of their
clothes as birds of their plumage. To
talk of their dress before them is fatal
to that spirit.
When unwise mothers or nurses admire
them, in a particular costume or discuss
its becomingness, the poison begins to
work.
It is wisdom on the part of parents to
. encourage the visits of their children's
friends and make them so welcome that
they may feel at' home. So it may bo
Judged whether or not their companion

may be, since she nresumably knows

DO you happen to know her? If not,
you may consider yourself fortu
tunate Indeed. Lives there a man
with soul so dead that he really-'
enjoys hearing the amateur elocu- ,
tlon of a schoolgirl? It is said that "love
is blind," and so, alas, arc the mothers
and relatives of embryo, would-be elocu
tionists of the feminine persuasion.
Oh, girls, why will you do it? :
Are there not other arts which -would be

which makes your audience feel ashamed

blinded maternal ancestor, and perhaps,
by chance, the paternal also?
Not one girl In a thousand has any real
talent for elocution, and yet It seems to us
that about half of the girls nowadays
are laboring under the fatal delusion that
they have marked talent in that direction.
We have in mind just now the one girl in
a thousand who has the "real thing"â
genuine talentâ "all wool and a yard
wide," and we have also in mind one of
those deluded ones who are chasing the
Ignus fatuus of the counterfeit.

when she addresses an audience, does bo

that one's sympathies go out to her at
once, and she hua only spoken a few
words when the audience is en rapport
with her. It ia not bo much what she
Bays, as how she says it. For instance,
If she Is going to say: "Waiter, bring me
a sandwich," she says it, and does not
yell like a raving maniac, supplicating
some unseen demon and fairly tearing her
hair out by the roots in her frenzy. No!
the girl with the genuine article makes
Her request In such a natural and winning
way that the people are moved, and feel
like Roln~ en masse to grant her request.
If she Hnys "This ia killing me," her
tone is Â«o genuinely full of sorrow that It
needs no tearing of hnlr and facial gym
nastics to prove It to them. They believe
It, nnd genuine tears are streaming from
their eyes; for she made it ronl, and did
not weaken the effect by clawing atten
tion to the fact that the diamond in the
ring on the middle finger of her left hand
la not a genuine one, and that when she
leans forward her waist twists In a way
which shows that her dressmaker also
is an amateur, and is not up. to dato in
her manner of clothing "tho human form
divine."
When girl No. 1 says anything funny it
seems to have sprung spontaneously from
the impulsive humor of a girl's fresh
heart, and does not seem at all seconU
hand. You are not painfully Impressed
with the fact that this la the place to
laugh, and you must do it if it chokes
you to death, because the watchful eyes
of the girl's mother are fixed upon you
and she knows that this is .ae proper
place to laugh, so you can't elective her
for one moment. She Is Buch a der>r
friend of yours, nnd It takes so little to
please her, so, Wiilfa you watch h>r
enRer fnce and see her lips moving in
unison with every word her daughter in
saying you take the cue, and -guided by
the mother's face you laugh at the prop
er moment, or rather, you do not laugh,
but go through n process which is n crosa
between a hiccough and n yell, and for
which you loathe yourself ever after, and
ho the day is paved, and the mother 13
still your friend. . iV.-A, â¢',
Girl No. 1 might say exactly the same
thing and you could not restrain yourself
âyou would roar, you would fulrly howl,
wime your sides would ache and the tears ;
would roll down your cheeks and you
would npplnud and try to bring her back
until your hands were fairly blistered,"
and yetâ ycu had heard girl No. 2 recito
that Eelf-same thing and you had no In
clination to laugh.
When girl No. 1 has said, "I am not
mad, but soon will be,", your very heart
went, out to the poor creature and you
believed it was really, true, and you cried Â»
until you were ashamed of yourself and
made furtive dabs at. your nose and
thought of the time wasted in '-putting "
cold cream and powder on the aforesaid
organ in order to look nice. What did it
matter whether you looked nice or not?
Looked nice, indeed! and that poor, sweet
thing there before you,, actually going
madâ MAD! Ohi it was horrible! Your
very soul^was convulsed- with agony. Sho
so young and beautiful,' too, and yetâ her
unaffected tone had carried such convic
tion with it that believe it you must.
A few weeks later you happened to be
at a "missionary tea" where the other
young female with elocutionary impedi
nients was to shine forth.
\ After the heathen had been fully dis
cussed, and 11 cents had been collected
for the support of "little Rose," a heath
en in a heathen land, and sister N
had read, the- "minutes" (they seemed
more like- hours) and weak, lemonade and
sponge cake had been passed around, the
"passer" /ailing all over herself in order
to hurry by the good old "sister" who
always took two piecesâ after all these
things- had been done and the heathen
duly commiserated for not coming: at
once en masse to our country and get
ting hold of our one exclusive form of
religion as fast as they could, then^ in
deed, came THE moment of all the meet
ing:. â â¢ ' .. â¢ â  . " -
The heathen were, "not In it" when
Sophronisby paced the boards. "There
was racing and. chasing on Cannnbie
Lea" when Sophia, with majestic mien
. and stately pride, condescended to amble'
out and place herself in front of the
portieres (portieres always' looked tragic,
she thought, there was always a chance
of some one being concealed behind them
witha- dagger, "don't you know")."
â  Well, it chanced that No. 2 had
made the same selection , as the one
tflth; which No. 1 girl had con
verted you into a perfect Niobe, but
evca though you. could plainly see her
inother working her lips a.nd searching
vainly in' the back breadth of .her skirt
for a handkerchiefâ even that did not
move you from your stoical indifference.
When she frantically pulled the trump
from her sleeve and yelled In a voice
which sounded like Finnegan in the pho
nograph, "1 am not mad, but soon will
be." all sorts of ridiculous answers filled
your mind, and you felt like saying,
"Bet your life, old girl," and instead of
putiing your handkerchief up to mop the
coptous tears, you put it up to hide the
idiotic grin which you felt was gradually
spreading from ear to ear. It seems to
you that you never were possessed of
such un insane desire to laugh, and you
know by watching the thermomctrlcal
expression of the mother's face that a
laugh at ihls juncture would be "the last
strlftv."
Oh, girls, girls, GIRLS! If you are cher
ishing illusions to the effect that you are
embryo geniuses In the elocutionary line,
go, I beg of you, and be phrenologized,
orâ or chloroformed, or anything, In fact,
except to grow up retaining the illusion
and Inflicting it upon patient and well
meaning people, who might othervviso
have been your friends. ";'

ehirt waist was a iltile wusli. thing, some- '<
thing- to : be picked up, put on, worn a
day and thrown aside for the tub. The
winter shirt waist is something that is not
to be tubbed,. but to be worn delicately,
wisely und well, and to be enjoyed as a
staple and- conventional feature of dress.
â  .Yet there are winter shirt waists that
can be tubbed. The new flannel waists,
made, with ; tucked yokes and plain. bust,
with buttons down the back, are titted for
washing, provided the colors be of; the

made without lining; there being the
veriest shell of a lining from the stock

Those who do'not fancy the back but

fullness just at each side of the throat.
and at the waist these plaits are again
laid with neat precision. There Is no other
trimming down the front, for the elegance
of this waist depends wholly upon the
general set of the collar, the way the
sleeves are put in, the : trlmness of the
back and' the squareness of the coat

on these lines is called the Kngliah waist,

modes and upon this fancy shirt waist
one expends one's .admiration, for it is u
thing'of much beauty.
A shirt waist, to tell of the handsomest
first, was made of panne silk, very soft
nnd very velvety upon tho surface. Its
color was the dearest rose, such a delicata
shade. The yoke, for It had u deep yoke
front and, buck, showed a covering of net
lace upon when' there, was a litlo silk cm
broidery. To the yoke hung a. deep fall
of lace. â¢- â  .. â¢ .
The upper part of the sleeves and th*
upper part of the waist were made of tha
pink* panne silk with u little figure in it,
all Htudded with, the tiniest steel nail
heuds. Around the elbows there was i\
band of chinchillu with a deep fall of side
reaching ulmost to the wrists.
The belt wag a very deep band of white
satin ribbon studded with steel and fas.
tened at the back, with three little buc
kles of eteel and rhinestones. Over this
belt fell a putting of plain pink panne silk.
to look like a blouse. The stock was of
pink velvet and lace.
Such u waist, worn, by |Mrs. Clareivo
Mackay, was one of the loveliest at a
matinee party, and owing to its high neck
and long sleeves It was wholly appropri
ate for the occasion and for the tea which
followed the theater. No hat was worn
with this shirt waist, but a little shouLier
cape* with a hood that came up over liiu
hair. The skirt was u plain black sain
one, trimmed with a deep flounce of k> â¢ t
lace with a little pink velvet laid unlor
the lace as a heading.
The Waist and Skirt.
The ehirt waist, while differing from the
skirt, matches it In many ways. It bears
a family resemblance to it in color und
often in general style, though rarely in
texture.
In these days of choux the matter of
color can always be arranged, and it ta
a simple thing to get color results from
the judicious use of ribbon and roses.
Upon tne shirt waists there. are choux.
and few are the dressy waists that do not
show from one to three of them. These
are made up In materials light or materi
als heavy; in ribbon,, in chiffon or in vel
vet, and in the hearts ot the handsomest
ones there nestles the fashionable rtM*.
Surely there was never a season when
the artificial rose was one-half as much
sought after nor a season when it was
used In more ways. The newest chou
sets show the rose nestling In the middle
of the chou, and besides they show a ro*e
dangling from the chou until It hangs at
the end of a ribbon. - A chou that wua
placed upon the bust of a gown worn bythe pretty Miss May Goelet recently had
two narrow ribbons fastened to It, and on
the other end of the ribbons there hung
a velvet rose, dangling fully four inches
below the chou. He sure in trimming uÂ»
your handsome shirt waists to use -arti
ficial roses in plenty, for you get the. fin
est results in that manner. . j
Quite apart from the waist of flannel,
or the one of handsome velvet and lace,
Is the winter shirt waist, which is made
of corduroy and its cousin, winter velvet.
This waist is for utility, and well does it
serve, out its self-appointed mission 7 of
wearing well. A good shirt waist of
heavy, warm, dark velvet will furnish
a staple article of dres.i for every day
all winter and probably make a mountain
jacket next' fall.
Get Good Velvet.
In buying a dark velvet shirt waist
there -is -only one course- openâ get the
best. Poor velvet never was a bargain at
any time and made up Into a shirt waist
it Is doubly not what It seems to be.
Good velvet does not "crock," does not
wear off, does not crease readily and is
warm and beautiful while an inch of it re
mains.
Corduroy is still more serviceable than
velvet, for it has about it certain admir
able traits of. durability. Where velvet
"spots" corduroy does not; it can be
cleaned here and there delicately with a
sponge and water. It wtll bear hard
usage and It Is a little heavier than vel
vet. â  ' â¢
The young women of New York's Pour
Hundred are wearing corduroy shirt
waists for their tramps daily on Fifth
avenue. They select the dark-green
shades, buttoned down the front with big
brass buttons, and they choose i the
strange blues, with their big army-like
fastenings. There are browns, too, browns
galore, In corduroys, and- the waists Hint
are made from any of these are good.
The corduroy waist is very much liked
made us a Norfolk, with a wide plait
each side of the middle of the back and
one each side of the middle of the front.
The plait is stitched upon each edge and
Is very flat and trim, not loose, uncertain
an- baggy, as some plaits are.
Corduroy is also brought under the spell
of the tucker's art and Is tucked. A
beautiful corduroy waist, worn by Mrs.
Harry Payne Whitney, was In black, *. .th
the uppers of the sleeves tucked as far
as the elbow. The tucks were very, very
small and were released only to allow
the elbow room, then were resumed again
to the wrist, where they were released
again to make a Russian puff, below
which came a tight little coat cuff, all of
corduroy. The waist showed a tucked
front, with the fullness of the release com
ing over the bust, then there was tucking
again, the whole caught in a belt, which
waa, very pointed In front.'- though not
by any means exaggeratedly so. â â¢ . -

pretty. The waist and skirt were alike
and inÂ» a tobacco brown." The skirt was

of stitching around the foot, and the

it she wore the prettiest. of ermine capes,
coming just over the shoulders. The cape
had â¢ those "eyes' 1 - which 'mark ermine
with the price mark of expen&lveness.
The collar was very tall, but was cut to
roll back irom the ears. . . !
Around the neck there was a iband.of
brown velvet put on in u half puffed, half
gathered fashion, with a big bow' in front
with Jong ends that came far bjelow the
waist. These ends were "made"; ones o"
velvet, cut slanting' upon the ends, and
widening all the wajr They were lined
with satin.
"Made" velvet bows will be very much
worn and the velvet in them must be of a
very, high quality. To be extremely up-to
date these velvet ends and loops, indeed
the whole bow, must be satin lined; in
stead of velvet lined, and they must be.
large, not at all suggesting the skimpy
little .velvet bow worn upon the shirt
waist a year ago.
The winter shirt walnt is built for the
back, as the summer tsliirt waist is built
for the front. The summer girl wants to
look attractive as she comes to meet you
in the sunlight. The winter girl must
look attractive at all times, in parlor and
in Kitting room, on dull days and bright
ones. To accomplish this she must build
her shirt waist for both views, front and
back.
Not a few of the new waists are ui
trimmed In front except for bunds, per
haps of sllk.Jaid on in great circles, one
circle looping the front from shoulder to
shoulder, one edge of the band sewed
tight, the other loo.Â«e. There may be three
bands of ullk, one laid below the other,
and slightly overlapping, as though they
were tiu-ks. This style is very much af
fected by those who like the shirt waist
that is buttoned In the back.
The buck of such a waist may be quite
elHborate with Its folds of silk, its hem
stitohiiiK and its very handsome buttons
whieh can sentinel the path between tho
back of the neck and the back of the
belt. â
The trick of trimming the waist for the
back view Is much noticed upon the even
in; waists. Many of these are positively
elaborate, even fussy, in the flouncing^
and. rutnings that fall from tho neck and
from the yoke. , .
â¢ ihere Is- a back that is liked by those
-who enjoy the French waist. It begins,
to start with the belt, with a very wide
liberty satin ribbon â¢ which Is hooked in
the back underÂ»a very.ornate buckle. Tho
belt In the back" is very, very wide and
would suggest an empire were It not for
the fact that It dips upon the sides and la
pulled low, in front.
At the back of this fancy French waist
there Is. a litle bolero, put on the back
only, for. it comes only from the armpits.
Then there ' s Â» little puffing of chiffor.
wnich falls below the bolero^and over
the belt all the way around; anl
finally/ to finish at the neck there, is a
yoke of lace with a deep lace ruffle. ThÂ»
stock ie, of course, necessary, but it is a
thing that Is put on afterward and whicto
can be varied. -
Shirt "Waist Belts.
The shirt waist belt is a thing that dÂ«
mands attention, for it Is a thing apart,
like tho stock. Belts spring up every
day, and are every day buried and for
gotten in the depths of Mme. La Mode's
castaways, but they come to light again,
anew; enjoying another existence.
The belt which at this very second
holds the center of the world's attention,
that part of It which is interested in the
winter shirt waist, Is the one that haa
two buckles, one in the middle of the
front and one In the middle of the back.
This may be a shaped belt, but it must
be Bhaped by some one who understands
the how und wherefore.
The buckle in the back, in the case of
the beltwlth two buckles, is the one that
Is for show. It is slidden upon a ribbon
and takes Its place right in the middle of
the back. It may be one of those long,
nanow buckles which make the waist
look so lengthy and slender, or it may be
a more up-to-date thine.
One of the very newest of the back-of
the-walst buckles looks like three buckles
â and, indeed, U Is three, fastened .under
neath in some way. Visible there are
three circular buckles caught in buckle
fashion through the Bilk. They may bÂ«
in pearls, which are so pretty, or In steel,
which is so fashionable, or In silver, which
is a fad with so manv women.
The newest convert to the silver fad Is
Queen Wilhelmina, who has decided that
all her small ornaments shall be stiver.

THE KING AND QUEEN

of King Chulalongkorn*of Siam,
and his Queen.
Hamilton King, United States
Minister at Bangkok, Slam, has' been in
formed through Prince Devawongse, Sia
ir.eso Minister for Foreign Affairs, that
King Chulalongkorn of Siam would like
to pay a visit to America in the near fu
ture. His, Majesty has It in his mind to

PINEAPPLES for decoration seem a
little odd, but they prove very ar
tistic for center tables. The variety
Caraguata cardlnalis , has green
leaves, the inner ones of the rosette hav
ing a magnlll: snt orange red tint. . Out of
this ro?ette rises the bright red blossom.
The brilliantly tinted leaves of blooming
plants retain their color a whole year.
Other plants show beautifully marked
leaves. Billbergla rhoducyanea, for In-
Htnnco, has liuted leaves, with wavy
white cross lines. Strong plants bear
stately blossoms surmounted by large
rose-colored leaves. These plants collect
a great deal of water in the funnel-shaped
base of the leaves, whereby the at
mospheric moisture necessary to the plant
Is created and maintained. The plants
renew themselves by sprouts, so that one
l)lant pronorly attended to provides never
ending pleasure.
THE SUNDAY CAT.L.

Hamilton King, our Minister at Bangkok, receives formal no
tice of Chulalongkorn's projected trip. The monarch wants to take
another look at western civilization for the benefit of his subjects.
He "will make the trip in hia own yacht. This visit should boom
American trade with Siam. ' ' C â 
thinks that such a visit would lead- to A
better appreciation of American institu
tions on the part of the Siamese.
For some years there have been period
ical rumors that the King Intended visit
ing America. There Is a certain degree
of caution "required In discussing and ar
ranging such a trip, because of the ne
cessity of determlninc the exact status
of the Ktng abroad In such a manner
that nothing might happen In his treat
ment which would cause him to lose^dlg
nlty In the eyes of his people." While^the
King waa on his trip through Europe
several years ago circumstances with re
gard to his reception gave rise to much
newspaper comment and misinterpreta
tion. It la against the possibility of such
misinterpretation that he wishes to guard.
He appreciates that for one monarch Lo
visit the realm of another means an in
vitation from the sovereign host 'and
more or less -recognition on the part of
the government to which he Is of neces-
Kity in the position of a guest. He at
the same time appreciates that with our
republic it must be quite otherwise, and
while he fully understands this and would
be glad to come to the United State* iu
a private capacity, if he could do so, for
the sake of the education it would be to
himself and his people, he feels a fear
that tff co in such a manner might be
regarded in Siam as indicating something
of hostility, or at least Indifference to his
country.
The King would come with his suite In
his own yacht to San Francisco. There
lives In Michigan,, at Grand Rapids, Rev.
Duniel P; Bradley, D. D., who was bowi
in Siam and lived there years ago as an
Intimate friend of his Majesty, and who
speaks the Siamese language fluently. He
would be of vast assistance, if his ser
vices could be secured in charge of the
royal party.
Siam Is well disposed toward us and
thoroughly appreciates the Influence of
America in the Chinese question. She has
known us, with the exception of the
Cheek case, very favorably through our
missionaries, but naturally through such
a channel she has known us only as a
good people* rather than as a. great and
strong nation. For political power she
has always looked toward Europe only.
The best Blum has seen or now knows
in commercial or industrial development
lias either been seen in Europe or been
brought hither from Europe by her lead
ers, very many of whom have been edu
cated there.
The stars and stripes have not been
seen in the harbors of Bangkok for over
six years, but American commerce is find
ing its way there and her products are
commending themselves in competition
with the cheap stuffs that flood the Ori
ent. Japan has opened her doors toward
American goods and American Institu
tions, and the ways of Japan are the am
bition of her little sister. All^thls makes
the King the more desirous of knowing
the United States.
Bee Venom for Rheumatism
A DOCTOR of much repute in Vien

edy for rheumatism the saturat
ing of tho patient's body with tha
venom of bees. For the purpose he ex
tracts the venom, treasuring it up in
quantity and applying it artificially in the
way of punctures. He founds this treat
ment on his discovery that rheumatic pa
tients do not suffer from a bee's sting
to anything like the same degree as other
people. He found that the r tumefaction
or swelling that follows the stinging of a,
bee does not appear In the rheumatic pa
tient unless ho has been stung several
times, while in gome cases the stinging la
hardly felt. When the patient suffers
himself to be stung repeatedly his, im

Mrs. Severance has been called "Tha
Mother of Clubs" so often that it is some
what of a blow to tradition to be told that
she does not wish the title.
Yet here is what she writes:
"I do disclaim being: called the Mother
or Clubs, since, although the New
York Sorosis was u trifle behind our lios
ton-or rather, to give it the true title,
our New England Woman's Club-they
should not bo rivals for that honor, but
call themselves 'twin clubs,' as our friemi
or San 1< rancisco, Mrs. Horace Davis, hap
pily named them. When I look over the
lists and activities of our numberless wo
man s clubs the world over, I feel like si
many times great-grandmother."
However, in spite of her renunciation of
the title, It was given to her with reason.

when the multitudinous facts and theories
crammed into baby headfi go in at one ear
and come out at the other, Jt is a marvel
to look upon the old-time pupils and see

Mrs. Severance, with all her up-to-date
ness, is an example of that old-school
training. Her courtesy is old-fashioned
and â  flawless. .That she devoted herself
also to the more solid branches at Mrs.
liicord's school is proved by the fact that
she was valedictorian of her class. She
was only sixteen years old at that time.
She married young. She has never been

Thirty West Fortieth street.
In winter the entertainment usually
takes the form of a little dance, lasting 1
from 4 until 7, during which the playing
of games alternates with or follows the
dancing. '
The shades are drawn, the gap and
lamps ure lighted, the music of a piano
or a piano and violin or harp is arranged
for, and the young hosts, simply dressed,
receive their guests, aided by the mother
or some older person who is fond of chil
dren. \
The pretty courtesies and generous lit
tle sacrifices demanded by the position
of host and hostess should be mado
to appear as their pleasant duty, and
that their chief concern must be to
play the games their visitors prefer, to
Bee that none are overlooked in the
dancing and at supper, and that every
one there has a good time.
The refreshments may be served when
things begin to drag. Supper need not
necessarily be the final feature. The
birthday cake may occupy the center of
the table, Its top either decorated with au
many small candles as the child has
years, or frosted to represent the dial
of a clock, the hand pointing to the nu
meral that coincides with the age of the
host or hostess. A wreath of green may
surround it, if flowers are too expensive,

THE SUNDAY CALL.
"The Best Known Club Women on the Pacific CoastP" Do you,,
know who they areP Or, in knowing who they are, have you ever
studied their personalities to know why they should be considered
the "best known"? /â  This sketch of Mrs. C. M. S. Severance is the
sixth in an interesting series on just those lines. ..
She married before she was 21. Auburn,
another of those small and exclusive New
York towns, was her home and there she
was married. She went at once to Cleve
land and set up housekeeping. Her hus
band was launching himself in life' as' a
banker. ' 'â 
There the younj? Severance family pros
pered in a worldly sense, -but there was
sorrow in the household when the oldest
from which each child draws a flower
Â«i:.J finds a little Rift attached to it.
It fulfills the child's idea of a good
time if there is something which may be
carried homeâ a tangible evidence of
what has passed like a dream. Therefore
a simple favor may be provided, either
in the way just indicated or placed at
each cover if the children sit at_table.
This is, of course, only adapted to a
very small party. Bouillon, sandwiches
rolled and tied with rihbons, oranges cut
in the shape of baskets and plenty of mot
toes suffice for the early supper.
In summer the birthday fete will be
the more enjoyable if held on the lawn
from 4 to 7 in the afternoon. In the free
dom of an "outdoor party," in the so
ciety of many playfellows, children ac
quire such bright spirits and are usually
in such holiday mood as to make any
great effort for their amusement unnec
essary.
Games of all kinds may give merry
occupation until a slight weariness begins
'â¢ . threaten,' and then the young folk
may be marshaled to another part of the
grounds, where little tables set under the
trees, decorated with daisies and butter
cups, will enable them to "play tea
party" after an ideal fashion. A sensible
menu that will be productive of no un
pleasant after effects may consist of
chicken sandwiches, -with milk or cocoa,
let) cream in flower molds, sponge cake
and plain bonbons. The costume mottoes
never fail to create a little flutter of fun
and excitement. The boys like the noise
and the girls enjoy the "dressing up."
There is often a birthday cake with can
dles, in which are baked a little ring and
thimble. When the cake is cut, great
interest is felt in their chance of desti
nation. A bowl of lemonade should be
accessible throughout the afternoon.
If the entertainment is In hi.nor of a
birthday, the guests often lung some
trifling gift to the young host or hostess
â Â»i book, a game, or some small inex
pensive souvenir.
Their greetings should be In the form
of congratulations â "Many happy returns
of the day," "I wish you a happy birth
day," or, as a bright little girl once
s -id, "I hope that you will have three
hundred und sixty-five happy days In this
year."
In taking Jeave, each little guest should
say to the lady of the house, "Good af
ternoon, Mrs ; I have had a very
pleasant time," or "Thank you, Mrs. ;
I have enjoyed myself very much," and
then bid the child host or hostess good
by with some cordial expression of pleas

been for this sorrow Mrs. Severance would
be less of a woman than she. Is , to-day.
Her warm heart and quick sympathy are

ripened under the influence. of trouble.
There were three children besides the

Silver, it may be remarked, is the desnair"
of the dress decorator, for it is very diffi
cult to get effects with it, whereas Bteel -
works in well and ' is decorative, while
gold is absolutely brilliant. Jet has a
wlnky attractiveness, and even gun metal
looks well 'from a distance, but silver has
a provoking way of disappearing across
the room. .
A back buckle that is worn by many of
the most fashionable dressers is in strips,
all : the parls coming together at the
middle, but separating Mop and bottom.
This makes a wide buckle, narrow just
where you would have it narrowâ at the
middle of the back. "Â»
The front of the buckle had better be
small, unless one is either- very, slender
or very much after effects. The. wide
front clasp has a way of making the ab- .
domen seem prominent, and is not becom
ing to many. The little, round buckle, the
medallion, the circle, the clasp, the little
no-matter-what ornament, so long as it is '
small, looks well upon all waists and can
be drawn down In the universal point.
With the Fur Wrap.
The most delightful feature of the new
shirt waists is seen In the manner in
which they are now being made to wear
with the fur wrap. They are actually
constructed for wear -with the shoulder
cape, and are not pretty unless worn with
it. True, they will pass muster when the
cape is slipped off, but by far the hand
somest part is that which appears below
the edge of the cape, when the cape is on.
A shirt waist, made to wear with a
deep velvet collarette, trimmed with, chin
chilla, was in de pegray silk flannel,
probably lined, for It was to be worn all
winter, with no other coat except the
shoulder ornament.
The front was built. upon the Norfolk
plan, with a big plait at each side of the
middle and big brass buttons upon the
middle, between the plaits. In front there
hungdown below the belt two wide basque
ends, while the belt, with its round waist,
wan cut off and in the back it was short,
coming just to the belt line. This half
Norfolk was very pretty for a winter's
day. â 
The project of owning two or three
shirt waists that are warm enough to
wear all winter under a shoulder cape is
a good one for the woman who la out
much in the air. This heavy shirt waist
Is comfortable for walking and does not
weight the shoulders like a coat. More
over, the little collarette protects the

noclety severely alone. She had no time

as much us /study did.
She began to write for publication. She
took up book reviewing and at last catne
the day when she went to report n wo
man's suffrage conventioln at Akron,
Ol'iii,' It was one of the first of them,
v/hen the movement *vns new and unpop
ular. This was in 1S51.
This wns the real beginnir^t of her pub
lic work. She was tired with Ihe spirit of
the convention und she returned home a
full-fledged surfifiglst.
She -wrote , clcvor nnd enthusiastic re
ports of the convention, nnd these led to
Jier being invited to prepare a memorial
to be presented to the legislature oC
Ohio. The Ohio Woman's ltights Asso
clMlon requested this, und it was through
this organization that she was started
\ipon her career as a suffragist. She came
quickly to prominence In this association,
for the president was absent from the
first annual meeting in 1853 and Mrs. Sev
erance was chosen to have charge of tha
session in her place. . â -.
From that time on she was a club wo
man amonfr club women. She moved to
Boston later, and thero'she kept up her
work. Her friends included some of the
best-known thinkers. Julia Wurd Howe
â was one of them. The famous .Hutchinson
family were of her intimate friends. Sen
ator John A. Foote encouraged her In her
juffrace work.
She has never lost her interest in thÂ«.
â work of women, and .when she took up
her home in IxÂ»s Angeles she went about
stirring women there. She founded the
Friday Morning Club in . , ISM. was its
active president until the labor became
too arduous., and since that has been
president emeritus of the 'organization.
Mrs. Severance has always delighted in
adopting proteges in, whom she saw
symptoms of talent, and her generosity
has carried her too far at times, makink
inroads upon her pocketbook for unde
serving people. She believes, however,
that it is better to give to the occasional
undeserving than to refuse the now nnd

beat article that could be chosen for the
winter's outing: woman.
There is a waist that is made peculiarly
.for walking .wear., IJke its sister waist
it is built for show below the deep fur
collarette, with this difference, that all
the trimming ia In the back. This Waist
is designed to be worn with the collar
ette that has tails or ends in front. The
back, which is protected only by .the.
cape, is elaborately trimmed below the
yoke, or. below where the cape ends. This
is a novelty- waist, but It may contain -a
suggestion for the woman who likes to.di)
everything in the right, way.
Waist' Materials.
In waist materials one is really unlimit
ed. There are new goods this yeur that
flllevery chink found vacant in laBt sea
son's demands. The latest fad is the waJst
( that Is made of men's overcoating. It is
vex-y heavy and is, indeed, a coat. It is
almost too thick to be worn with a cape,
a collarette or even a boa, though there
are chiffon boas that. come for tne pur
pose of wearing with these thick- waists.
The waists made of overcoating are for
the most part blouses, as there is really
no other way to handle them, unless it be
as a Norfolk or as a plain waist, pulled
down front and buck in that rather se
vere new style. . ' .
It is a pretty mode which makes this
heavy shirt waist unbuttonuble, and of a
style, that comes oft entirely. The stock
unhooks at one side. The waist unbut
tons down the 1 front. Under it there ia
a guy silk waist, all lace und furbelows,
or a plain bilk blouse, just as may be,
Such an unbuttonable cloth shirt waist
mukes an excellent and very serviceable
church waist. One can keep it on or take
it off.
i The taffetas are more durable than they
were and some of them almost rank with
cloth in point of durability. A business
woman, who carefully tests each shirt
watst from a standpoint of durability,
found that one of tho new black' taffetas*
recommended by her dealer wore her
counting day for day, as. long as one of
cashmere. In point of beauty and com
fort she elected in favor of the talfeta,
though eomo find cashmere u more com
panionable stu rr.
The figured silks, the Loulsines, pompa
dours, Empires and colonial silks are all
relieved of their objectionable features by
the way in which they are treated. If you
cannot wear a whota bodice of J-ouismj
silk, with its scattered flowers, you cun
wear a deep yoke of it, and your sleevo
puffs can be of I^ouisine. The rest of tha
waist can be in plain silk of a color to
match the background of your Louisine.
Then your belt can be a little black velvet
strip and your stock can be of the same,
the latter overlaid with a strap of white
lace juit where it turns over under the
chlu.

THERE are some things better
than to be born with a silver spoon
in one's mouth.
One of these is to be born with
a great gift and then, just at the right
moment, to have a fairy-godmother ap
pear.
r In this story Edna Darch of Los An
geles is the good little girl and Calve
âcapricious, captivating, quick-pulsed
Calve â is the fairy-godmother, and
Hans Christian Andersen couldn't do
anything better if he tried.
The Darches are poor, but Edna has
a voice, and Mme. Calve has promised
to see that she has a future.
In other words. Calve is to do for
the child what the parents would gladly
do for her if they could â have her voice
trained by the best masters and fit her
for the operatic stage. More than this.
Calve herself will take her*ior a time
under her ov-n tuition.
Did ar.y princess in a fairy-book, or
out of one, ever fare better than this?
â¢ And it has all happened so suddenly
and unexpectedly that Edna Darch feels
as though she were afraid to open her
eyes wide lest she find she has been
asleep and it was only a dream.
She knows how that feels, for she
tried it once â just the night before she
tang for Calve. She had dreamed that
Nordica heard her sing and had taken
her away to Europe and made her a
great artist. Just as she was singing,
â w-ith all the world at her feet, she
woke up.
4 "Do you believe in dreams?" asked
her older sister when Edna told her of
the beautiful dream.
"No. But I wish they came true."
Even then, unknown to the child, a
letter had bem written to Calve asking
her to hear Edna sing.
Not that Edna's teacher hooed for
anything more than a word of praise
that might be used to advertise a bene
fit concert which it was proposed to
give in January to help a little with the
expense of music lessons. The wages
of a clerk in a lumber-yard do not war
rant the training of nightingales.
Calve, seeking rest at Pasadena, had
shut herself away from all visitors.* and
that she should take fitsc to listen to
an aspiring child singer was almost a
vain hope. -But Edna had a teacher who
knew that her pupil was a genius, and
for more than a year her one wish has
been that the child should sing for a
truly great artist.
Something in the letter struck a
chord in Calve' s warm heart. She con
sented, and on the very day of Edna's
dream the vision of the night was part
]y realized.
Edna Darch. in a plain little cotton
frock, with a voice that faltered iust ther
least with excitement, sang for the great
song-geddess. the unrecognized fairy
godmother.
"Beautiful, ravishing, magnificent."
â¢whispered the artist as the child sang.
It took but one look from the deep,
wonderful eyes of- the diva to tell the
child that all was well, that the soul of
the other understood.
AfteT the ?ong there were more hugs
znA kis*es and more adjectives.
And then all in a moment Calve made
ier plans.
She must take Edm with her. teach
her. have her study and hear other great
artists, and have pretty frocks and furs
â but simple, mind yon. for'da petite.
And then Paris, and then â the world.
No wonder the child blinked hard and
pinched herself to-make sure she was
really awake.
Edna Darch has always loved music,
always lived for it.
When a baby, tied in her little rock
ing chair and left to amuse herself, she
sang and sang, rolling her eves far
back and rocking vigorously to help
make the high notes come.
Her mother had the love of music and
an car for it. without the knowledge of
it. and her father had a voice. Edna's
gift was a natural one. and when she
was old enough both parents meant
that she should have the best help they
could give her.
But the best is not to be had for the
least money, and it was not until a fam
ily friend came to the rescue with an
open purse that Edna could have in
struction worthy of her art.
For a year or two she studied only for
piano, but that other longing would not
cease. Still she must sing, stretching
her voice from its highest to its lowest
pitch.
Then, when she was nearly 12. she be
gan to study voice culture with Miss
Elizabeth Carrick. There were no more
wild, unstudied bursts of sone. She
must sing not higher than D for a
whole year, and not more than an hour
a day in fifteen-minute periods.
When she was just slipping into her
teens there was a short rest, and she
was not allowed to sing a note.
In those days Edna was restless and
unhappy, but she obeyed her teacher.
Yet the music must out. and the child
would shut herself away in a room and
whistle until her overburdened soul
/ouid relief.
\ When she went back to her lessons
Eagaio her tones were rounder, fuller.
more mature. But now she must not grÂ»
hieher thai E. with an occasional E
with Miss Carrick. by way of a treat.
Not only must Edna thank Miss Car
rick for her first training, but for this
great opportunity that has come to her.
HM the teacher known less of the value
of Edna's voice she might still be work
ing hard to play and sing for a recital
which at most would bring her but $25.
It was really Miss Carrick who discov
ered this embryonic artist. A year asro
she had the child sing for Damrosch.
and the great interpreter of Wazner
prated her. v '*A
"Did he say no more?" asked Calve in
surprise when told that he had heard it.
But she was reminded that a year ago
th* voice was but half of what it is now.
Edna and her mother had their
Thanksgiving dinner with the fairy
godmothÂ«*r. and it was a dinner that
no"r of the three will ever forget; W
Mrs. Darch was the silent one. for
'fhack of the thankfulness for her child's
fortune was the thought of sep
aration. â â¢" -/, -â â¢" r
"But I shall not steal her awav from
you." said Calve. "She will stUl -be
your daughter. But from to-dav I must
attend to her needs, give her everything
and attend to her education for three
years. Then she will be ready to make
her debut. She shall sing Micaela
when I sing Carmenâ or, no, she will
be an ideal Marguerite."
The diva talked on, carried away with
her plan.
"I would take you with me to-day,
but that is too soon. You will wait and
come with your mother and meet me in
New York December 20. We will have
Christmas together; then when the
mother sees that you are happy in your
new home she can come away.
"No, you must not live with me. You
must learn nothing now of the theater,
not yet. You must remain sweet and
good and pure as you are now. You
will live with some friends, and study
German, Italian and French, for the last
year will be spent in Paris. You must
know French, for my sak- -~r so much
is lost when everything must be repeat
ed between us."
To the mother Calve said in parting:
"Je suis devout-mpi. I believe in le
bon Dieu and his wisdom. I shall not
let la petite forget that God is over all.
I shall arrange everything so that if I
die the child shall not suffer. I am now
responsible to you and to God fpr the
little one."
Before leaving for San Francisco
Calve took measures . for the pretty
things she is to buy for her protege,
and these will be sent to her for her
journey to New York.
At the train when she left Los An
geles Calve met Edna's father, and
when he saw the great songstress clasp
his child in her arms and kiss her again
and again he felt that she had found a
place in a warm mother-heart.
And row before leaving the home
where, she has worked so hard for her
art Edna, is busy and happy as a bird.
She spends three or four hours a day
studying French, for she must not sing
again until she is with Calve. Then
there is the dear piano nearly filling the
tiny parlor which she cannot abandon
all at once. And as she sits and dreams
and plays, the faces of Beethoven and
Mozart and Paderewski and the rest
seem to speak to her from out f their
frames, encouraging her to work, work,
work for the great art.
"I feel as if I had been away up in tfco
air and then dropped avpay down and
had just come up to the surface." she
said as she finished a serenade of ; her
own composition. "But I am so happy.
"See, here is a chain Calve gave me."
and she Held out a thin gold strand with
a strange little pendant. '
"That is an â  Egyptian charm, and
stands for strength, force, perseverance.
"I felt something cool on my throat
and Calve turned me to the mirror. â¢
"'There,' she said, 'you must wear
that because you were sweet and inno
cent when you came to me and you
must be sweet and innocent always.'
"She had on her neck a wonderful

rope of pearls, and as I kissed her my
hand passed over them. I could not
help asking if they were real. She took
my face between her hands and said,
'Ma petite, mon enfant. I* would not
wear them if they were not. If you can
not have what is genuine have nothing.
Let nothing about you be sham.'
"Oh, yes, and she gave me a hat that
she had brought from Paris. It is so
pretty and plain, just black straw with
a bit of ribbon and a feather.
" " 'You must wear it when you come
to meet me in New York, and I shall
have one made just like it to wear my
self when I come for you.
" 'You must wear it now.' she added,
and took the rubber from my red hat
and pinned it in and put the hat on my
head.
" 'But you must always keep the little
cotton gown and the jacket and red hat
so we can look at them sometimes and
think of the time we first met.'
"This made me feel very near to her.
and already I love her very much. And
my mother, too; when she first saw her
face she felt drawn to her. and when we
were at the table on Thanksgiving day
mother could scarce eat for watching
Calve's face."
Edna will be 14 in January. She is
the picture of health, with a clear skin.
a winning smile and the verv dearest
bit of dimple just where the smile
stops. In soite of praise and good
looks enough to turn many a head, she
is Â«ti!l thoroughly unspoiled.
"I have always wanted to be a great
musician, always." she said. "I have
worked hard, and it is hard work to be
come gre?t v/hen one is poor.
"AnH when I am a great artist?
Well. I shnll try to do something for
those who have been so good to me."10

The other xuve a start and old not look
picased. Then iÂ»Â« instinctively glanced
toward She caSt'.e.*. . â :
"The Princess i.s at h*r window." he
cried, clutcbii;? Lorry's arm a;id pointing
back. But the oilier refused to turn,
walking on JjHikJI.v. "You ought not to
have acted like ;hat. Greu." said Anguish
a few momenta laterJ "She saw me call
your attention to her. and she raw yo'.i
refuse to look back. 1 don't think that
you should have hurt her." Lorry did
not res-pond, and there was no word be
tween them until they were outside the
castle gates.
"You may leave to-morrow, Lorry, if
you like, but I'm going to stay a while,"
said Harry, a. mile confusedly..
"Haven't you had enough of the place?"
"I don't care a whoop for the place.
You see. it's this way: I'm jus^. as hard
hit as you, and it is not a Princess that
I have to contend with."
"You mean that you are in love with
the Countess?" c
"Emphatically."
"I'm sorry for you."
"Think she'll turn me dov.n?"
"Unless you buy a title of one of these
miserable counts or dukes."
"Oh, I'm not so sure about that- These
counts and " dukes come over and marry
our American girls. I don't see why I
can't step in and pick out a nice little
Countess if I want to."
"She is not as avaricious as the counts
and dukes, I'll wager. She cares nothing
for your money." /
"Well, she's as poor as a church mouse"
said the other, doggedly. v
"The Countess poor? How do you
know?"
"I asked her one day and she told jue
all about it," said Anguish.
XIV-4THE CLASH AND ITS RESULTS.
"I feel like spending the rest of my days
in that monastery up there," said L'orry,
after dinner - that, evening. They were
strolling about the town. One was deter
mined to leave the city, the other firm in
his resolve to stay. The latter won the
day when lie shrewdly, if explosively, re
minded the former that it was their duty
as men to stay and protect the Princess
from the machinations of Gabriel, that
knave of purgatory. Lorry, at lasC recog
nizing the hopelessness of his suit, was
ready to throw down his arms and aban
don the field to superior odds. His pre
sumption in aspiring for the hand of a
Princess began to touch his sense of hu
mor, and he laughed, not very merrily, it
is true, but long and loudly, at his folly.
At lirst he cursed the world and every one
in it, giving up in despair, but later he
cursed only himself. Yet, as he despaired
and scoffed, he felt within himself an
ever-present, hope that luck might turn
the tide of battle.
This puny ray grew perceptibly when
Anguish brought him to feel that she
needed his protection from the man who
had once sought to despoil and who might
reasonbly be expected to persevere. He
agreed to linger in Edelweiss, knowingt
that each day would add pain to the tor
ture h*e was already suffering, his sole ob
ject being-, he convinced himself, to frus
trate Gabriel's evil plans.
Returning late in the evening from their
stroll, they entered a cafe celebrated in
Edelweiss. In all his life Lorry had never
known the loneliness that makes death
â¢welcome. To-night he felt that he could
not live, so maddening was the certainty
that he could never regain joy. His heart
bled with the- longing to be near her who
dwelt inside those castle walls. He scoffed
and grieved, but grieved the more.
The cafe was crowded with men and wo
men. In a far corner sat a party of Ax
phain nobles, their Prince, a most demo
cratic fellow, at the head of a long table.
There were songs, jests and boisterous
laughter. The celebration grew wilder,
and Lorry and Anguish crossed the room,
and, taking seats at a table, ordered wine
and cigars, both eager for a closer view
of the Prince. How Lorry loathed him!
Lfcrenz was a good-looking young fel
low, little more than a boy. His smooth
face was flush ?d, and there was about
him an air of dissipation that suggested
depravity in Its advanced stage. The face
that might have been handsome was thÂ«
reflection of a roue, dashing, devilish He
was fair-haired and tall, taller than his
cenrpanions by half a head. With reck
less abandon he drank and sang and Jesr
ed, arrogant in his nighty merriment.
His cohorts were not far behind him in
riotous wit.
At length one of the revelers, speaking
in German, called on Lorenz for a toasf
to the Princess. Yetive, his promised
bride. Without a moment's hesitation
the Prince sprang to his feet, held his
glass aloft, and cried:
"Here's to the fairest of the fair, sweet
ictive, so .Â».ard to win. too good to l".se
â¢She loves me. God bless her heart! Ana
I love h*r, God bless my heart, too. For
each kiss from her wondrous lips I shall
credit myself with one thottsand gavvos
That is the price of a k'ss."
"I'll give two thousand!" roared one of
the nobles, and there was a laugh in
wh;ch the Prince joined.
"Nay ! I'll not sell them now. In after
years, when she has grown oid and her
lips are parched and dry from the siy
pings I have had 1'Ji sell them all a\ a
bargain.- Alas, she has rsot yet
kissed me!"
Lorry's heart bounded with joy, though
his hands were clenched in rage.
"She wtJ! kiss me to-morrow. To-mor
row I shall taste what no other man has
touched, what al! men have coveted. And'
I'll be sener.ius, gentlemen. She is bo
lali that your foul mouths would blight

'Don't you dar? ;t. tlrir.k that toast!"
cried a 'voice- 5ii hi?- asiorifshei! car, a voice
speaking in excited German. He whirled
iin'i taw a scowling face beside his own,
â a pair of rrray eyes that flashed fire.
"What do you mean?" he demanded,
a:iser replacing iiÂ«5aze;ne:it. The other
ir.tnXcn of.hi^iarty stood as if spell
bound. , _
â¢J Kic&ii that you speak at the Princess

"Oh!" scrcariiert the Prince, convulsed
with rage, starting back and instinctive

"I'll insult you mow decidedly; just to
avoid misapprehension," snaried- Lorry,'
swinging his Wg-fist squarely on the
mouth of the Vrince.-His PLoyal Highness
landed under a table ten feet away.
Instantly the cafe was in an uproar.

after which thÂ« Graustark spectators ".and

an instant,- yet a sensa-tion that would
live in the gossip of.^geserations had been
created. A Prince of tne realm ,had been
brutally assaulted! 'Heading his jaw, Lo
renz picked himself up ircm the floor, sev
eral of ills friends _ running to his aid.
There was biood im-lns lips and chin; it
trickled to. his shirt iicnt. For somVmo

"I am Lorenz of A::phain, sir," he said
at last, his ,vo:co quivering with sup
pressed anger., . â  *"
"It ; shall be "a pleasure ti> "kill -you. Lo-.

his ignorance of lese-r.i;ijesty. :
Anguish, pale and -'ery much concerned,
drag<jod him away, the Prince leaving the #
cafe ahead cf them, *pll=wed by bin chat
tering, cursing companions. Prince Ga
briel was standing near the door as they
passed cut. He looked" at the. Americans
sharply, and Anguish detected' 1 something
like tr'umphar.t joy -in his eyes." ,r r.
"dood' Lord, "^orry; this means a duel!
Don't you know that?" cii'ed he, as they
started upstairs.
"Of course, I. do. AnJ I'm. going to kill,
that vil!ain, toJ," exclaimed Lorry, loud
enough to.-be heard from one end of the
room to the other.
"This is horrible, horrible! Let me
square it up some way if " began the
alarmed Anguish^ . n
"Square it up! Look here. Harry An-;'
guish, I am the one who will do the squar
ing. If he wants a duel he can have it
at any old time and in any style tie de
sires." . s
"He may kill you!"
"Not while a just God rules over Qiir
destinies. I'll take my' chances with pis
tols, and now let me tell you one thins,
my boy; he'll never live to touch his lips j
to hers, nor will there be a royal wedding.
She cannot marry a dead man." He was
beside himself with excitement and it was
fully half an hour before Anguish could
bring him to a sensible discussion of tlie
affair. Gradually v he became cool, ano,
the fever once gone, he did not lose his
head again.
"Choose pistols at ten paces and at 8 to
morrow," he said, nonchalantly, as a. rap
at the door of their apartment announctd
the arrival of the Prince's friend.
Anguish admitted two well dressed,
black-bearded men, both of whom had
sat at the Prince's table in the cafe. They
introduced themselves as the Duke of Mjz--'
rox and Colonel Attobawn. Their vioit
was brief, formal and conclusive. r .
"We understand that you are persons
of rank in your own America?" said h!s.
Grace of Mizrox, after a. few moments;-..
"We are sons: of business .men,'.' â  ic;-
sponded~Mr. Anguish. .'.,."*"â¢"â :â  .'. " >; ' â¢
"Oh, well, I hardly .know. But his his u
ness is very willing to waive his rank ami
.to grant yotia meeting."; .
"I'm delighted by. his Highness' comJe- '
scension/ which I perfectly understand," _
observed Mr. Angiiish. " â¢ "Now; what have .
we to settle,' gentlemen?" . V -â 
"The detail of weapons."
When Anguish announced that his prin
cipal chose pistols a strange gleam crept
into the eyes of the Axphainians, and
they seemed satisfied.. Colonel Attobawn
acted as Interpreter during this .short but
very important interview which; was car
ried on in the Axphain language. Lorry
sat on the window-sill, steadfastly gaz
ing into the night. The visitors departed
soon, and it was understood that' Prince
Lorenz would condescend to meet . Mr.
Lorry at 8 o'clock on the next morning
in the valley beyond the castle, two miles
from town. There Is no law prohibiting
duels in Graustark. .
"Well, you're, in. for It, old man,""said
Anguish, gloomily, his chin in his hands
as he fastened melancholy eyes upon his
friend. - ' .. ' ' ..
"Don't worry about me, Harry. There's
only one -way for this thing to end. His
Royal Highness is doomed." Lorry spoKe
with the earnestness and conviction of
one who is permitted to see into the fu
ture.
Calmly he prepared to write some let
ters, not to say farewell, but to explain
to certain persons the cause* of the duel
and to say that ho gloried In the good
fortune which had presented Itself. One
of- these letters was addressed to his
mother, another to the father of Prince
l^orenz, and the last to the Princess of
Graustark. To the latter he wrote much
that did not appear in. the eplstlfes di
rected to the others."- Anguish had been '
In his room more than an hour, and had;
frequently called to his friend and begged
him to secure what rest' he could in
order that their nerves might be steady
in the morning. But it was not until
after midnight that the duelist sealed
the envelopes, directed them and knocked
at his second's dor.r to say:
"Ij shall entrust these letters to you,
Harry. You must see that they start on
their way to-morrow."
Then he. went to bed and to sleep.
At C his seco'nd, who" had slept but lit -
' tie, called him. They dressed hurriedly
and prepared for the ride to .the valley, j
The!r own new English bulldog revol
vers were to serve as weapons in the
coining combat, and a carriage was to be
in waiting fox" them in a side street at 7
o'clock. J
Before leaving their room they -heard â 
evidences of commotion. In the hotel, and
were . apprehensive lest S the inmates had
learned of the duel and., were making
ready to follow the fighters , to the ap
pointed spot. There was a. confusion of
voices, the sound of rpshing feet,' the
banging of doors; the noise increasing as
the two men stepped Into the opeu hall. .
They were amazed to -see half-dressed
' men and women standing or* running
about the 1 halls/. Intense excitement in
their . faces and in their actions. White
uniformed, policemen' were Hocking" into
the xsorrl'dora; soldiers, coatlcss.and hat
iess. fresh from their beds, came dashing
upon the scene. There were excited cries,
angry shouts and, more mystifying than
all, horrified looks and" whispers.',. 1..
1 i "What ''has happened?" asked Lorryi
stopping I near the door. ; ; ,
'â¢ "lfciui't be a fire. Look! .The door to
that' room ,. down there seems to be the
center of attraction. Hold on!: Don't
go over there, Lorry. There, may be
something to unnerve you, and .that. :
must not happen' now. Let us
go down this stairwayâ It leads id a side
entrance, I think." They were Jfalf wayj
down the stairs when the thunder of ,
ru.sh'.r.g feet in the hall above. -came to
their ears, causing them to hesitate t be
tween curiosity and good judgment. r
"They are coming this way!"
"Hear them howl! What the devil can
be the cause of all this rumpus?," cried
the other. / '.
.<\t that Instunt a half dozen police
guards appeared at the head of the stairs.
Upon seeing the Americans, they stopped
and turned as- if to oppose a ..foe, ap-
preaching from the opnositei.direction.
Baron Dangloss separated himself from
the white coats above and called to the
men below. In alarm they started for the
street door.. He was with, them. In an in
stant, his usually. red face changing from
white to "purple, hte anxious eyes. darting
first toward group above- and' then
toward the bewildered Americans.
. "AVhafs the matter?" .. demanded Lory.
. "There! Seel" cried _Dang]oss, and even
as lÂ»e Â«poke a conflict began at the head
of , the stairs, the police, augmented by
a" few soldiers, struggling against a howl
ing.'enraged mass- of' Axphainians. . Dan-
Gloss^ . dragged" 'his reluctant charges
through a , small door, and they -found
themselves in the baggage-room of the
hotel.- Despite their queries, he 'offered. no
explanation but rushed them along, pass
ing- out of the opposite door, down a short
stairway and into a side street. A half
dozen police guards Were awaiting them,
and before .they could catch the faintest/
. idea of what it all meant they were run
ning- with the officers through â  an alley
as if pursued by. demons. . ' â 'Â« 'â '"â <â 
-"Now, what in thunder does this
mean?" panted 'Lorry,' attempting to
slacken the,pace. He and Anguish were
just beginning to regain tti'eir senses. V
"Do not stop! Do' not stop!" wheezed
Dangloss. ."You. must get to a piac'e of
safety. We cannot prevent ., something
dreadful happening if you are caught."
-. "If we aie caught!'.' cried Anguidh.
"Why, -what have we done?"
"Unhand me, Baron Dangloss! This is
an. outrage!" shouted Lorry.
"For God's sake, be calm! We are. be
friending you. When we reach the Tower,
where you will be safe, I shall explain,"
gasped the panting Chief of Police. A
few moments later they, were inside the
prison gates, angry, impatient, fatigued.
"Is this a plan to .prevent" the duel?" de-,
manded Lorry, turning upon the Chief, who
had dropped limply into a chair and was
mopping his brow. When he could find
his breath enough to answer, Dangloss
did so, and he might as well have thrown
A bombshell at their feet.
"There'll be no duel. Prince Lorentz is
dead!" -.â -. .-â¢ ,;
\T>ead!" gasped. the others.
"Pound dead in his bed. stabbed to the
heart!" exclaimed the Chief. "We have
saved you from his friends, gentlemen,
but I rihist say that you afe still in a
tight Dlace." -
He then related to them the whole story.
Just before 6 o'clock Mizrox had gone to
the Prince's room to prepare him for the
,duel. The door was 'closed but unlocked,
aa he found after repeated kuockiiigs.
Lorenz was lying on. the bed. undressed
and covered with blood. The horritled
duke made a liasty examination and found
that .he was dead. 1 A dagger had been
driven to his hearths' he slept. The hotel
was- aroused, the police called, and the
excitement was at its' highest pitch when
the two" friends came from their room a
few minutes after 6.
"But what have we to do with this
dreadful affair? Why are', we rushed off
here like criminals?" asked Lorry, a feel
ing of cruel gladness growing out of the
knowledge that Lorenz was dead and that
the Princess was freed from her compact.
"My friend," said Dangloss, slowly "you
are accused of the murder.
Lorry was too mucn stunned -to be an
gry, â¢ too we^feiio protest. For some mo
ment after.the blow fell he and Anguish
were speechless. Then came the pro'testu
tio lia, *he. rage and the threats, through
all of which Daugloss sat calmly. Finally
he sought to quiet them,' partially suc
ceeding.

here, sir, because it la the only place in
which you are safe. Lorenz' s friends would
have torn you to piece-j had we not found
you first. You are net. prisoners, and you
may depart if you think it wise." '
"But, my God, how, can they accuse me?
I knew nothlnq of the murder â : until ' J
reached this place," crk-d Lorry, stopping
short in his restless walk before the little
Baron. ' ' ".'-..- <â 
"So you say, butâ â 'â¢
"If you accuse me, -camri you, I'll kill
you!" whispered Lorry holding himself
tense. Anguish caught and held trim..
"Be calm, sir.V cautioned Dangloss: ;< 1
may have my views, bm I am not willing
to take oath before her Uajasty. Listen:
You were heard lo;say you would kill
mm; you began the lipht; you were the
aggressor, arid, there is no one else- on
earth, it is said, who could have wished
to murder him. The man who did' the
stabbing entered the room through tie/
hall door and 'eft by. thesame. There are
"drops of blood In the carpet leading dU
rect to your 'door. Onyour knob are the
iprints' of bloody fingers where youâ or
some one elseâ placed his Siand in open

by me and . my men; tjÂ»&t fully convinced
the- enraged friends_ of the dead "Prince
that you were guilty. When we; opened
the door you;wcre gone. Then came the
search, the fight at the head of the stairs
and the race . to the . prison." The reason
I saved you - from , that mob should bo

doubt, but nowânow it would be madnejs
to fac/e them. : I know" not what they
â¢have done to my men at the hotelâper
haps butchered them." â 
t There was anxiety in Dangloss' voice
and there was honesty in his keen old
eyes. His charges now saw the' situation
clearly and apologized warmly for the
words they had uttered under the prei
sure of somewhat extenuating - circum
stances.' They expressed a willingness to
remain In the prison until the excitement
abated or until some Xne swore; his life
against the suppose! murderer. They
were virtually prisoners, and they knew,
It well.. Furthermore, they could see that
Baron' Dangloss believed Lorry suilty . of
the murder; protestations' of innocence
had Tjeen politely revived and -politely
disregarded. .â¢
"Do you expect one of his friends to
take the oath?" asked Lorry. , .
"Yes; it is sure, to ; came." â  : .

XVIIâ IN THE TOWER.. ' '-;,
The two captives .who were not" prison
ers y/ere so dazed by ' the â  unexpected
events of the morning that they did. not
realize the vast seriousness of- the situ
ation for hours. Then it dawned upon
them . that . appearances ' *: were really
against them, and that they were, alone
THE SUNDAY CALL;
in a land far beyond the reach of help
from home. One circumstance puzzled
them with its damning mysteryâ how
came the blood stains upon the ' door
knob? Dangloss courteously discussed
this strange and unfortunate, feature
with them, but /with ill-concealed skep
ticism. It was evident that his? mind was
clear in regard to the wTiole affair. â¢
Anguish , was of the opinions that the
real murderer had stained the knob; in
tentionally," aiming 1 to cast suspicion on
the man who had', been challenged.
The | assassin had an object - in
leaving: 1 those convicting finger-marks
where they would do the most dain
nge. . He either desired ", the arrest
and a death of the , American or hoped
that;hls : own guilt .might escape atten
tion.- through the misleading evidence.
Lorry: held, from his â¢deductions, that the
crime had been committed by a fanatic
who ; loved his sovereign 'too devotedly to
see her wedded .to. Lorchz. Then why
should he wantonly cast guilt upon the
man who.had been her protector, object
ed Dansloss. ; ' : . : .-:â â¢â â 
The police guards came in from the
hotel about 10 o'clock, bearing marks of
an ugly conflict with the Axphainians.
They reported that the avengers had been
tiuelled for the time being, but that a
deputation had already started for the
ensile to lay the matter before the Prin
cess. Officers had searched the rooms of
the.Americans for blood stains, but had
found no sign of them.
"Did you find bloody water in .; which
hands had been washed?" asked Anguish.
'-"No," responded one of the guards.
"There was nothing to be found in the
bowls and jars except soapy water. There
is not a blood stain in the room, captain."
"That shakes your theory a little, eh?"
er^d Anguish, triumphantly. "Examire
Mr) Lorry's hands and see if there" is
blood upon them." Lorry's hands were
white and â¢ tmcon tarn mated.' Danglossf
wore' a pucker on his brow.
Shortly^ afterward a' crowd of Axpbain
men came to the prison gates and de
manded the person of Grenf all Lorry, de
parting after an ugly show of rage. Cu
rious / Edelweiss citizens stood afar off,
watching' the walls and windows eagerly.
"This may cost Edelweiss a great deal
of trouble, gentlemen, but there Is more
happiness here this morning than the city
has known in months. Everybody be
lieves, you killed him, Mr. Lorry, but they
a!l love you for the deed," said Dangloss,
returning at noon from a visit to the ho
tel and a ride through the streets, VThe
Prince's friends have been at . the castle;
since 9 o'clock, and I am of the opinion
that they are having a hard time with .the
High Priestess." -- . v v" ;
"God bles3 her!" cried Lorry. > . "
"The town > is crazy with excitement.
Messengers have been sent to old Prince
Bolaroz to inform him of the murder and
to urge him to . hasten hither, where he
may fully Â«njoy the vengeance that is to
be wreaked upon his son's Blayer. I have
not seen a wilder i time in Edel
weiss since the close of . the siege,
fifteen years ago. By -my soul,
you. are in a bad box, sir. They are lurk
ing in every part of town to kill' you if
you attempt to leave the Tower before
the Princess signs an order to restrain
you legally. Tour life, outside these
walls, would not be worth' a snap of the
fingers." . .
Captain Quinnox- of the Princess' body
guard, accompanied by a half dozen of
his men, rode up to the prison gates
about 2 o'clock and was promptly admit
ted. The young captain was in sore dis
tress.
"The Duke of Mlzrox has sworn that
you are the murderer, Mr. Lorry, and
stakes his life," said he after greetings.
"Her Highness has just place'd In my
hands an order for your arrest as Ithe as
sassin of Prince Lorenz." :
Lorry turned as pale as death. "Youâ
you don't mean to say that she has signed
a warrantâ that she believes me guilty,"
he cried, aghast.
"She has signed the .warrant, but very
much against her inclination. Count
Halfont informed me that she pleaded and'
argued with the 1 Duke for hours, seeking
to avert the act which Is bound to give
pain to all of us. He was obdurate, . and
threatened to carry complaint to Bolaroz,
who would instantly demand satisfaction.
As the Duke is willing to die if you are
proved Innocent there, was no other'course
left^ for her than, to dictate and 'sign this
royal decree. Captain Dangloss,. I anvin
structed to give you these papers. â¢ One
is the warrant fqr Mr. Lorry's arrest, the
other orders you to assume charge of
Jiim and to place him in confinement un
til the day of : trial.'! ' '
While Quinnox was making this state
ment 1 the accused .ftood with bowed head
and throbless heart. He -did hot see the
captain's hand tremble asi he passed the
documents to Dangloss, nor did he, hear
the unhappy sigh that came from the lat
her's lips. Anguish, fiery and Impulsive,
was not to be subdued. ...
"Is there no warrant for my arrest?"
he demanded. ..'
. "There is not. You are at liberty to go,
sir," responded Quinnox.- . -
"I'd like to know why. there isn't. I
am just as guilty as Lorry." . '
"The Duke charges the crime to . but
one of . you. Baron Dangloss.S will yotf
read the. warrant?" . 'â  . â¢
The old Chief read the decree of the
Princess -slowly and Impressively.- It was
as follows: ' /
" Jacot, Duke of Mizrox, before his God
and' on his life swears that â¢ Grenf all
Lprry did foully, .maliciously and 'de
signedly . slay Lorenz, Prince of Ax
phain.^on the. 20th day of October, In the
year of our, Lord, 1P3-, and in the city
of Edelweiss, .Graustark. It is therefore
my decree'ihat Grenfall Lorry be declared
murderer of Lorenz, Prince of. Axphain,
until he be proved Innocent, in whlch^in
stance his accuser, Jacot, Duke of Mlzrox,
shall; forfeit his life, according to .the law
of this land providing penalty for falso
witness, and by which . he himself has
sworn to abide faithfully. '
"Signed: ;.Yetive."
There was silence -for some moments,
broken by , the dreary tones of the ac
cused.
"What chanco have I to prove my-in
nocence?", he. asked, hopelessly.,
"The same opportunity that he has to
prove your guilt. The Duko must, ac
ccfrdiria:. to our law, prove you guilty be
yond; all^doubt," spoke the young cap
;."Whon:'am I to be tried?"
"Here is my order from the Princess,"
said Dengloss, glancing over the other
paper, "It says that I am to confine you
securely and to produce you before the
tribunal on the 26th day of October."
"A : week! '< That is a long tjme," said
Lorry. '"May I have permission, to see
the. signature affixed 'to those papers?"
Dangloss handed them to him. Ho glanced
at i the name he; loved, written by the
hand he had kissed, now signing away his
life; perhaps. A mist came, over his eyes
and a strange Joy filled his soul. The hand
that '-. signed â¢ the name had trembled in
doing so, had . trembled" pitifully. , ; The
hea*-t tiad not guided the fingers. "I am
your prisoner, Captain Dangloss. Do with
me as 'you will," he said, simply.
"I regret, that I am obliged to place
you in a cell, sir, and under guard. Be
lieve'me,' I am sorry this' happened. * \l
am your friend," said the old man, gloom
ily.:. .'â â 
"And I," cried Quinnox. ' :â 
: "But what is to -become of me?" cried
poor Anguish, half in tears. "I won't
leave' you-, Gren. It's an infernal out
rase!'* : -
"Be cool, Harry, and it will come out
right, "v. He has no proof, you know," said
the- other, wringing his friend's hand.
"But ..I'll', have to stay here, too. . If I
go" outside these walls I'll be- killed like a
dog."- protested Harry.
VYouare: to have a guard' of six men
while you are in Edel^/eiss, Mr. Anguish.
Those are the Instructions of the Princess.
I do not believe, the scoundrels â I 'mean
the' Axphain noblesâ will molest you If
you do not cross them. When you are
ready to go to your hotel, I will accom-J
pany you."
â  Half an hour' later Lorry, was in a cell
from which there could be no 'escape,
while Anguish was toward the
hotel, surrounded by Graustark soldiers.
He had sworn to his friend that he would
unearth the murderer if it lay within the
power of man. Captain Dangloss heard
the oath and smiled sadly.
At the castle there was depression and :
relief, grief and joy. The royal family. ;
the nobility, even the servants, soldiers
and attendants, rejoiced in the stroke.
that had saved the Princess from a fate
worse than death. preserver's mis
fortune was â  deplored deeply
oi sympathy were whispered among them
all, high and low.; The Axphainians were
detestedâ the Prince most of all â and the
crime had corneas a joy instead of a
shock. There were, of course, seriou3
complications "for the future, ' inrolving
ugly conditions that were bound to force
themselves upon the - land. l * The dead
man's father would demand the life of
his murderer. If not Lorry, who? Grau
stark would certainly be asked to pro
duce the man who killed the heir to the
throne of Axpbain, or to make reparation
âbloody reparation, no doubt. â 
In the privacy of her room, the stricken
Princess collapsed from the effects of the
ordeal. Her poor brain had striven in
vain to invent means by .which she
might save the man she loved. She had
surrendered to the inevitable because
there was justice in the claims of the in
exorable Duke and his vindictive friends.
Against her will she had issued the de
cree, but not, - however, until she had
learned that he was in prison and unable
to fly the country. The hope that delay
might aid him in escaping [ was rudely
crushed when her uncle informed her of
Lorry's whereabouts. She signed the de
cree as if in a dream, a nightmare, with
trembling hand \ and \ broken heart. His
death warrant! And yet like all others
she believed him guilty.. ' Guilty . for her
sake! ; And this' was how she rewarded
him.' v , ; . . : â¢?,;>
/ Mizrox and his friend3 departed in tri
umph,' revenge written on every face. She
.walked ; blindly," numbly ; to her room, as
sisted by her uncle, the Count. 'Without
observing her aunt or the Countess Dag
mar,' she staggered to the window, and
looked below. The Axphainians were
crossing the parade ground jubilantly.
Then came, the clatter of a horse's hoof
and Captain Quinnox, with the fatal pa
pers in his possession, galloped down the
avenue. She clutched the curtains dis
tractedly, and; ieaning far forward, cried
from the open window: '.
"Qulnnox! ' Qulnnox! I Come, back! I
forbidâ I forbid! Destroy those papers I
Qulmiox!"
But Quinnox heard not the pitiful wall.
He; rode on, his dark face stamped with
pity for the man whose arrest he was to
make. Had he heard | that cry ; from '.his
sovereign the papers would. have been in
her destroying grasp with the speed .that
comes only to the winged birds. .Seeing
him disappear down the avenue, she
threw . her hands . to her head and sank
back with a moan, fainting." Count Hal
font caught her in his arms. It was
nightfall before she was fully revived.
The faithful young Countess clung to her
caressingly, lovingly,, uttering words of
consolation until long after the shades of '
night had dropped. They were alone In
the Princess' boudoir, seated together"
upon the divan, the tired head of the' one
resting wearily against the shoulder of
the other. Gentle fingers toyed with the'
tawny tresses, and a soft voice lulled with
its'consollng promises of hope. Wide and
dark and troubled were the eyes, of the
ruler of Graustark.
Ah attendant appeared and announced
the arrival of one of the American gen
tlemen, who insisted on seeing her maj
esty at once. The card' on- the tray bore
the name of Harry Anguish. At once^he
Princess was aflutter with eagerness 'and
excitement. â 
'-. "Anguish! Show him to this room quick
ly! Oh, Dagmar; he brings word from him!
He comes from him! Why is. he so slow!
Ach, I cannot wait!" ,'
Far from being slow, Anguish was ex
ceedingly swift in approaching the room"
to which he feared admittance might be
denied. He strode boldly, .impetuously
into the apartment, -his. feet muddy, his
clothing splashed with. rain, his appear
ance. far from that of a gentleman.
â¢ "Tell me! What Is It?"' she cried, as he
stopped in the center of the room and
glared, at her. . \, ,7.?-,.
"I don't; care whether you like It, and
it-doesn't matter if you are a Princess,"
he exploded, "there are a few things I'm
going to'' say : to you.' First, I want to
.know what kind of a woman you are to
throw Into prison a man likeâ like.â Oh,
it- drives me crazy, to think of it! I don'.t
care if you are insulted. He's a friend of
mine and he is no more guilty than you
are, and I want to know what you mean
by. ordering his arrest?"
- Her lips parted as if to speak, her face
grew deathly pale, her fingers clutched
the edge of the divan.- She stared at him
plteously, unable to move, )tp speak. Then
the blue eyes filled with tears, a sob came
to her lips and her tortured heart made
a last, brave effort at defense.
â  ' "Iâ Iâ Mr. Anguish, you wrong meâIâ
I-: â " - ; She 1 tried to whisper through the
closed throat and stiffened lips*. Words
failed her, but she pleaded with those wet,
imploring eyes. His heart melted; his an
ger was swept away in a twinkling. â¢ He
saw that he had wounded her most un
justly.
j . "You brute!" hissed the Countess, with
Hashing, indignant eyes, throwing her
arms about the Princess and drawing her
head to her breast.
: "Forgive me," he cried, sinking to his
knee before the Princess, shame and con
trition in his face. "I have been half mad
this whole day, and I have thought harsh
ly of you. I now see that you are suffer
ing more intensely than" I. I love Lorry,
and that 13 my only excuse. ,He Is being
foully wronged, your Highness, foully
wronged.".
; VI deserve your contempt, after all.
Whether he be guilty or Innocent, -I should
have, refused to sign the decree.. It is too
late nowT I have signed away, something
that ia very dear to meâ his life. You are
his friend and mine. Can you tell me what
he thinks of meâ what he saysâ how he
feels?" She asked the triple question
breathlessly.
"He believes you were forced into the
act and said as much to me. As to how
he feels, I can only ask how you would
feel if you were in his place, innocent and
yet almost sure of â  conviction. â¢ These
friends or Axphain will resort to any sub
terfuge, now that one of their number
has staked his life. Mark my. word, some
one will deliberately, swear that he saw
Grenfall: Lorry strike the blow and that
will be as villainous a lie as riran ever told.
What lam here for, your. Highness, Is to
ask if that decree cannot be withdrawn."
1 "Alas, it cannot! r would gladly order
his release if I /could, : but you can. see
what that would. mean to, us. .- A war, Mr.
Anguish," she sighed miserably.
?"But you will not see ah innocent man
5 condemned?" cried he. again Indignant.
"I have only your statement for that,
sir, if you will pardon me. I hope, from
the bottom of my heart.' that he did not
murder the Prince after bÂ£ing honorably"
challenged!" â¢â¢ â  .
"He is no coward!" thundered Anguish,
startling both women with his vehe
mence. "I say he did not kill the Prince,
but I'll stake my, life he would have done
eo had they , met this morning: " There's
no use trying to have the decree rescind
ed, I see, so I'll take my "departure. I
don't blame you, your Highness; it is your
duty, of course. But it's pretty hard on
Lorry, that's allj.'.
"He may be able to clear himself,'' sug
gested the Countess, nervously. .
"And he may not, so there you have it.
What chance have two Americana over
here with everybody against us?" , .
"Stop! You shall not say that! Ho
shall have full justice, at any cost, and
there is - one here ' who is not against.
him," cried the Princess, with flashing
'eyes; " â¢ '-'-' 'Â» â 
"I am : aware that everybody admires
him because he has done Graustark a
service in ridding it of something; obnox
iousâa prospective husband. But' that
does not get- him out of jail." V:
â ""You are unkind' again," said the Prin
cess, slowly. . "I chose my husband, and
you assume much when you intimate
that I am glad because he was mur
dered." > â  â 
"Do not. be angry," cried the Countess,
impatiently. "We all regret what: has
happened, and I for one hope that Mr.
Lorry may escape from the tower and
laugh for'evermore at ,his pursuers.' / If
he could only dig his way out!" " '
The Princess shot a startled look to
ward the speaker" as a . new thought en
tered her wearied brain; a short, involun
tary gasp told that Jt had lodged and
would grow. She laughed at the_ Idea of
an escape from. the tower, but' as she
laughed a tiny spot of red began to
spread upon her cheek, and her eyea
glistened strangely.
Anguish remained with them for half
an hour. When he left the castle it was
with a more hopeful feeling In his breast.
In the Princess* bed-chamber late that
night two girls in loose silken gowns sat
before a low fire and talked of something
that caused the Countess to tremble with
excitement when first her pink-cheeked
- soyerelgn mentioned It in confidence.
XVni-FLIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.
Lorry's cell was as comfortable as a
cell could be made through the efforts
of a ,kindly jailer and a sympathetic
chief of police. It was not located In the
dungeon, but - high ?n the tower, a little
rock-bound room, with a single barred
window far above the floor. There was a
ted of iron upon which had been placed
a clean mattress, end there was a little
chair. The next day after his arrest a
comfortable armchair replaced the latter;
a table, a lamp, some books, flowers, a
bottle of wine and some fruit found their
way to his lonely , apartmentâ whoever
may have sent them. Harry Anguish was
admitted to the cell "during the afternoon.
He promptly, and truthfully denied all In
terest In the donations, but smiled wisely.
He reported that most of the Axphain
contingent was still in tpwn; a portion
had hurried home, carrying: the news to
tne old Prince, instructed by the aggres
islve Mizrox to fetch him forthwith to
i.EdelweissV Where his august presence
,was necessary before the twenty-sixth.
Those who' remained. In the 'Graustark
.capital were uuiet. but still in a threat
ening mood; The Princess, so Harry in
formed , the prisoner, : sent sincere expres
sions of sympathy, and the hope that all
â¢would end Veil .with him. Count Hal
font, the Countess, Gaspon and many
other* had asked to be remembered. The
prisoner smiled wearily and promised that
they, should not . be forgotten in a weekâ
which 'was as far as he expected his
memory .to extend. â¢ .'.
Late in the evening, as he was lying
on his bed, staring at the shadowy ceil
-Ing and puzzling his brain with most op
pressive uncertainties, the rattle of keys
In . the ' lock announced the approach of
visitors. The . door swung open J and
through the grate he" saw Danglosa and
Qulnnox.' The latter wore a long mili
tary rain coat and had just come in from
â  a drenching downpour. Lorry's reverie
had been so deep that he had not heard
the thunder. ' nor 'the howling winds.
Springing to his feet, he advanced quick
ly to the grated door.
"Captain Qulnnox brings a private mes
sage from the Princess," said the chief,
the words scarcely more than whispered.
It was plain that the message was impor
tant and of a .secret nature. Qulnnox
looked up and down the corridor and
stairway before thrusting the tiny note
through the bars. It was grasped eagerly
and .trembling fingers broke the seal.
Bending near the light he read the lines,
his vision blurred, his heart throbbing so
fiercely that the blooa seemed to be
drowning out other sounds for all time to
come. In the dim corridor stood the two
men, watching him with bated breath
and guilty, quaking nerves.
"Oh!" gasped Lorry, kissing the mis
sive insanely as his greedy eyes careened
through the last line. There was no sig
nature, but in every word he saw her
face, felt the touch of her dear hand,
heard her timid heart beating for himâ
for him alone. Rapture thrilled him from
head to foot, the delirious rapture of love.
He could not speak, so overpowering was
the Joy,- the surprise, the awakening.
"Obey!" whispered Qulnnox,, his face
aglow with pleasure, his finger quivering
as he pointed cbmmandingly toward the
letter. . . -
"Obey what?" asked Lorry, dully.
_ "The last Hne4"
He hastily reread the last line and then
deliberately held the precious missive
over the lamp until it ignited. He would
have given all he possessed to have pre
served it. But the last line commanded.
"Burn' this at once and in the presence
of the bearer." ..*-*'^
"There!" he said, regretfully, as he
crumpled the charred remnants between
his fingers and turned to the silent
watchers.
. "Her crime goes up in smoke," mut
tered Dangloss, sententiously.
"The Princess commits no crime," re
torted Quinnox, angrily, "when she trusts
four honest men." /
"Where Is she?" whispered the pris
oner, with thrumming ears.
"Where all good women should be at 9
o'clockâ In bed," replied Dangloss, short
ly. \ "But will you obey her command?"
"So she commands me to escape!" said
Lorry, smiling. "I dare , not disobey my
sovereign, I suppose."
. "We obey her because we love her"
said the captain. of the guard.
"And for that reason I also obey. B>Â»t
can this thing be accomplished without
necessitating explanations and possible
complications? I will not obey if it ; s
likely to place her In an embarrassintr
position." â¢ Â°
She understands perfectly -what she is
.doing, sir. In the first place, she has had
my advice," said Dangloss, the' good old
betrayer of an official trust.
"You advised her to command you to
allow me to escape?"
â  "She commanded first and then I ad
vised her how to command you. Axphain
niay declare war a thousand times over
but you will be safe. That's all weâ I
mean, all she wants."'
"But I cannot desert my friend. How
ls he to know where I've gone? Will not
vengeance fall on him instead?"
"He shall know everything when the
proper time comes. And now, will you
' be ready at the hour mentioned?. You have
but to follow the instructionsâ I should
'say, the commands of the writer."
\ "And belfree! Tell her that I worship
her for this. Tell her that every drop of
blood in" my body belongs to her. She
offers mo freedom, but makes me- her
slave for life. Yes, I shall be ready.
If I do not see you again, good frfends,
remember that I love yo 1 * because you
loveher and because she l'ves you enough
to entrust a most dangerous . secret to
your keeping, the commission of an act
that may mean the downfall of your na
tion.*; He shook hands with them fer
'vently.
"Jt cannot be that. sir. It may cost the
lives of three of her subjects, but no man
save yourself can involve the Princesytjh
the crown. They may kill Qs, but tnv^

but throw myself at her feet! I must see
her before I go. I will not go without tell

passionately.
"You must obey the commands Implicit

"This escape means, then, that I am
not to see her again." he said, hia voice
chekins with emotion.
"Her instructions are that you are to
go to-night, at once," said Dangloss, and
the black-eyed soldier nodded confirma
tion. V.;..
The prisoner paced the floor of his cell,
his mind a jumble of conflicting' emotions.
His clenched hands, twitching - lips and
half-closed eyea betrayed the battle that
was Inflicting him with Its carnage.' Sud
denly he darted to the door, crying:
"Then I refuse to obey! Tell her that

death be the alternative." The two men
stared at him in amazement and con
sternation.
"You will not escape?" gasped Qulnnox.
"I will not be dragged away without
seeing her," he answered resolutely,
throwing himself on the bed.
"Damned young ass!" growled Dan
gloss. The soldier's teeth grated. A mo
ment later the slab door closed softly, a
key rattle, and his visitors were gone
messengers bearing to him the most posi
tive proof of devotion that man could
exact. What had she offered to do for
his sake? She had planned his escape,
had^ sanctioned the commission of an un
paralleled outrage against the laws of
her landâ she, of all women, a Princess!
But she also had sought to banish him
from the shrine at â â¢ which his very soul
worshiped, a fate more cruel and un
endurable than the one she would have
saved him from.
He looked at his hands and saw the
black stain3 from the charred letter, last
evidence of the crime against the stace.
A tender light came, to his eyes, a great
lump struggled to his throat and he
kissed the sooty spots, murmuring: her
name again and again. How Jonely he
was? 'How cold- and Cheerless his casts!
For the first time he began to appreciate
the real seriousness of his position. Uj)
to this time he had regarded It optimis
tically, confident of vindication and
acquittal. His only obiection to imprison
ment grew out of annoyance and the
mere deprivation of liberty. It had not
entered his head that he was actually
facing death at close range. Of course,
it had been plain to him that the charges
were serious, and that he was awkwardly
situated, but the true enormity of his
peril did .not dawn upon him until free
dom was offered in such a remarkable
manner. He grew' cold and shuddered In
stinctively as he realized that his position
was so critical that the Princess had
deemed it necessary to resort to strategic
measures in order to save him from Im
pending doom. Starting to his feet he
paced the floor, nervousness turning to
dread, dread to terror. He pounded on
the door and cried aloud. Oh, if he could
but bring back those kindly messengers!
Exhausted, torn by conflicting emotions,
he at last dropped to the bed and burled
his face in his arms, nearly mad -with, tha
sudden solitude of despair. He recalled
her dear letterâ the tender, helping hand
that had been stretched out to lift him
from the depths into which he was sink
ing. She had written. â he could sea the
words plainly â that bis danger -was great;
she could not endure life until she knew.
him to be safely outside the bounds ox
Graustark. His life was dear to her, and
she would preserve It by dishonoring her
trust. Then she had unfolded her j.!an
of escape, dlsjolntedly, guiltily, hopeless
ly. In one place near the end she wrote:
"You have done much more for me than
you know, so I pray that God may be
good enough to let me repay you so far
as it lies within my power to do so." In
another place she said: "You may trust
my accomplices, for they love me, too."
An admission unconsciously made, that
word "too."
But she was offering him freedom only
to send him away without granting one
moment of joy In her presence. After all,
with death staring him In the face, the
practically convicted murderer of a prince,
he knew he could not have gone without
seeing her. He had been ungrateful, per
haps, but the message he had sent to her
was from his heart, and something told
him that it would give her pleasure.
A key turned suddenly in the lock, and
his heart bounded with the hope that It
might be some one with her surrender In
response to hia ultimatum. He sat up
right and rubbed his swollen eyes. The
door swung open, and a tall prison guard
peered in upon him, a sharp-eyed, low
browed fellow in rain coat and helmet
His lantern's single unkind eye was
turned toward the bed.
"What do you want?" demanded tnÂ«y
prisoner, irritably. f
Instead of answering, the guard prcH
ceeded to unlock the second or grated
door, stepping Inside the cell a moment
later. Smothering an exclamation. Lorry
jerked out his watch and then sprang to
his feet, intensely excited. It was just 13
o'clock, and he remembered now that sh<J
had said a guard would come to him at
that hour. Was this the man? Was the
plan to be carried out?
The two men stood staring at each other
for a moment or two, one in the agony of
doubt and suspense, the other quizzically.
A smile flitted over the face of the guard;
he calmly advanced to the table, put
ting â¢ down his lantern. , Then he
drew oft his rain coat and hel-y

ART NOTES AND GOSSIP IN THE LOCAL STUDIO
THE New York critics are saying
many interesting things about trie
Californian artist, Amedee Joullin.
In the Town Topics of Nevember
the critic, Byron P. Stevenson,
says: "Nearly all of Joullins pic
tures shown at the Union League are ex
traordinary. When they are impressions
they do not slur over the tale they are
Intended to tell; when they are more high
ly finished the work does not stultify the
-^iruth. There is great skill shown in the
Yirawing and coloring of his figures, and
the landscapes -are refreshing in their nov
elty.* They are as bracing as the air in
â¢which they are painted. A glorious sunset
has all the color wealth of a Turner.
These landscapes are the work of a true
artist, a man who loves his work and
does not attempt to foist vagaries on the
public. The art committee of the Union
League are to be congratulated for intro
ducing him in the East, where he will
soon be appreciated at his true value."
That is the kind of thing we like to
bear about our native sons of California.
As a city or country is sometimes judged
by a stranger from the breadth of Its art
ist element. It may be a satisfaction to
the residents of San Francisco to know
that the circle of active professional art

thought.
This is the season of exhibitions. The
last two months especially have been
happy in studio openings, water color and
oil displays. During the last week of No
vember a fashionable crush attended the
annual exhibition and reception given by
L. P. Latlmer and pupils in the Maple
Room of the Palace Hotel. The place was
prettily decorated in a harmony of green
and the walls were well covered with
about two hundred water colors and some
black and whites representing the class
work of the last year.
The Improvement over the work display
ed in 1900 was very noticeable, and both
Mr. Latimer and the students are to be
congratulated for the progress shown.
Very few from the brush of Mr. Latimer
himself were in evidence, but those few
attracted a great deal of attention. One
in particular, a marine, was much ad
mired. During the week a number of
sales were made. A musical programme
was given each evening of the exhibition.
Miss Ethel Wicks will hold an exhibi
tion in the maple room on the 13th and
14th of this month (December.)
An exhibition in the studio of Annie
Frances Briggs, 44 Pine street, the last
three days In November showed some de
lightful studies in water colors.
Miss Briggs had a class In Monterey
the greater part of the year, but still
found time for her own brush to repro
duce many of the most beautiful portions
of the old capital. Among her most re
cent a picture called the "Three Oaks"
was very much admired. A sandy road
winds up the slope and disappears in the
heart of the wood. To the right In the
foreground stand three majestic old oaks,
tbÂ«> roots firmly grasping the bank,
a lunch and getting a cup of tea and the
use of a table for your picnic. But there
are things going on in that same tea
garden that may not have been called to
your attention.
You are used to the quaint houses, the
pools with their goldfish, the picturesque
bridges. You know the stunted ancient
trees, the chrysanthemums and the tea
that the smiling. geisha serves so dain
tily. But have you heard that the road
way between; the garden and the knoll op
posite is going to be filled In and on the
knoll is to be built a Japanese temple and
the whole to be changed to conform with
Japanese Ideas?
This means much more space, more
bridges to cross, more fish to feed and
beautiful In rich green, restful in dignified
simplicity. The composition is out of the
ordinary and the picture full of feeling.
Some fine glimpses of the Alameda
marshes were shown, also several Hol
land scenes, but none attracted more at
tention than the little Montereys, the sand
dunes, the cloudy effects and snatches of
the coast. Miss Briggs has surely helped
to immortalize that picturesque old place.

For another thing we are to have a bit
of real country, the wild flower kind of
country, introduced into our very midst.
California is noted for her wild flow
ers and in no park in the world are these
selfsame flowers so well looked after and
protected as in Golden Ga^e Park.
It 'is good to think that they are as well
cared for and worked on as the rare ex?
otics in the hothouses. Any day now one
may see the men at work, spading and
clearing, among the daisies and forget
me-nots.
Orders are given to increase the number
of wild flowers this year, the yellows and
blues arid reds, so that the banks may
make the road worthy of its name, "The
color from the well-known painter of
flowers, Paul de Longpre. This work is
not only attractive for the graceful/group
ing,' the delicate coloring, but from â¢ a
botanical standpoint the flowers painted
by .'this artlst'are extremely interesting.
Each flower in color, texture and every
minute detail is finished. "â  Each petal is a
study in itself. Among the most admired
is a branch of.the pepper tree, showing

well balanced. Both the. subject and its
treatment make one conscious of the
earnestness of the artist, of the simplicity

will compare favorably with that of many
artists whose works are better known.

with Innes, quotes the painter, who one
day remarked, "I never knew how to man

is the result. Mr. Baker was provided
â with credentials that permitted him to
eee and hear much that is denied to the
ordinary traveler. A glimpse at. the
chapter headings of his book will give
an idea of its contents. Mr. Baker Is a
rare hand st gathering facts and under
the following headings he has placed
many that would have escaped the ord
inary traveler entirely unless his atten
tion had been especially called to them
by a person of the author's experience:
"Common Things Seen in Germany,"
"The Kaiser," "The German Private Sol
dier," "A View of the German Working
man," "A German Professor/' "A Typi
cal Scientific Institution," "How the
Germans Created a New Industry." "A
German Venture In Practical Philanthro
py," "How the Germans Build Ships,"
"Some New Educational Ideas in Ger
many," "A Glimpse of German Student
Life," "The New Germany."
The following extract describes a corps
duel at Wollnitz. Read it and you will
probably fin.I that you have had a very
mistaken idea concerning these German
student duels:
The dueling hall was a long, low-raf
tered room s^t about with tables and
benches. In the center there was a strip
of black canvas, well sanded, on which
the duelists were to stand. Blood was
ppattered everywhere, on the white
washed ceiling above, on the walls and
rrindows at each side, and there was fresh
evidence of the last duel on the floor. The
spectators formed a ring about a sword's
length from the place where the con
testants were to 6tand, those behind
mounting on the benches and tables, until
the whole room was walled in with hu
man faces, and most of those faces bore
the gashes and scars of just such con
flicts as the one we were now to see. Two
Furjreons came in bringing a bowl of
Mine antiseptic solution, a roll of absorb
ent cotton and a bundle of bandages.
They had added oilcloth aprons to their
Â«rblte surgeon's blouses. A student in a
purple cap arranged a chair at each end
of the canvas strip, the backs facing:.
And now came the duelists themselves
with their seconds. An American uni
versity crowd would have cheered madly,
each corps for its favorite fighter: but
there was no sign of excitement or en
â¦hufiasm here, although every >eye was
f>xe<3 on the combatants. They were -both
powerfully built men. â  so tall that when
they raised their swords the points bare
ly escaped touching the ceiling. Both
here the scars of past duels, ' and both
had the reputation of being hard fighters.
The s=econdÂ§ and other attendants looked
narrowly to the adjustment of the ar
mor. And such armor as this was. A
knight of the old crusades could hardly
have been more completely protected.
Thick leathern stocks or collars covered
each combatant's throat,- holding his chin
souarely in place and preventing the pos
sible severing of the jugular vein. Thick
ly upholstered pads covered the shoulders.
The front of the body, from just above
the heart downward, was protected by a
shield not unlike that worn by an Ameri
can baseball catcher, only much heavier
and" thicker. The shields worn by both
of these duelists had a peculiar bronzed
appearance, which we took at first glance
to be the natural shade of burnished
leather. On closer examination, however,
we discovered that this color was the re
sult of the blood of many battlesâ the
same armor doing service in the duels of
an entire corps.
Heavy outjutting spectacles protected
the eyes of the duelists. They were held
in place by stout straps, which, in pass
ing round the head, bound the ears
irmly back. We observed, however, that
parts of the ears protruded above and
below the straps, a fact accounting satis
factorily for the fashion among advanced
German students of wearing their cars
squared either at top or bottom or both.
All the combatants' heads, therefore, ex
cept the eyes and part of the ears, were
entirely unprotected, although, as we
afterward learned, in some duels there
is an agreement to permit the covering
of the nose, some students preferring to
retain their noses intact. It is the sole
purpose of each duelist to cut his oppo
nent somewhere in the face or head, else
the scars will not show and much good
honor will go to waste. This is the chief
purpose of the thorough protection of the
body and the exposure of the face.
We observed that each second gave
Epecial attention to the covering of his
chiefs sword arm, which consisted of a
heavy cloth pad extending from the
shoulder down to the wrist.
The stress of many duels had cut the
outer covering of this portion of each
duelist'F armor into picturesque and
bloody tatters. And now the opponents
â  re faced, looking squarely into each
others eyes, and yet making no sign of
recognition and saying nothing, not even
to their seconds'. It is a point of honor
that there must be no show of emotion.
Each wore the gay cap of his corps,
vizor turned behind. As they raised their
arms each second stepped quickly for

into the basket handle of the sword. A
dost disagreeable weapon is this sword.

of whom were armored almost /as effect

eyes and shoulder*, lifted their hats and

duelists said nothing at all, but looked

point of his eword behind that of his
chief, so that he may not strike until the
final word is given. "Bound," comes the
reply, followed immediately by the shout
ed word, "Los" Goose). â¢ -.
There wan a downward rush of black
padded arms, a flash of swords, a din of
clashing steel, and then, before the battle
seemed fairly begun, there was a' shouted
"Halt," and the seconds rushed in with
their swords and threw up the blades of
the fighters. So quickly was it-qyer with
that one imagined there must have been
pome mistake, but this was merely the
first round. It had lasted perhaps five sec
onds, and there had not been to exceed
four swift strokes and parries' of each
duelist's sword. The chief surgeons cam*
up and examined the duelist's heads In
the most matter-of-fact and businesslike
manner. There were no wounds. A fel
low-corpsman ' lifted the sword arm of
each fighter, holding it out horizontally,
and another supported each sword. A duel
imposes a hard strain on the fighter's
sword arm, heavily padded as it is. and it
must be thus held up between rounds.
Everything had been done with so much
seriousness and formality, especially the
examination of the surgeons, and -the
round had been so short and so bloodless,
that an outsider could not 'help feeling
that a German student duel had its;irre
sistibly humorous side.
A moment sufficed .for the rest. Again
the swords went up. again the seconds
shouted, and again at the word "Los" the
clashing of swords began, this time more
swiftly and fiercely. Suddenly we saw a
lock of hair shoot from the head of one
of the fighterp. instantly followed by the
shouted '"Halt" of the seconds and the
upward swee? of thÂ«> swords. The hair
bad fallen from the purple â Bavarian; tha
umpire marked down credits for the green
â vâ Tyrolean. Again the surgeons ma.de ah
examination. There were no wounds, but
there' needed, no other evidence as- to the
keenness of the, blades than the smooth
ness "and closeness -with which that lock
of hair had been clipped. We could see
the bare place above the Bavarian's . ear
where it had been. The Tyrolean corps
man was slightly taller than his oppo
nent, though not so -powerful of build.'
He wore a heavy black mustache. The
Bavarian had been slightly pale from the
first, but absolutely unwavering.
The third round was already, beginning
with that peculiarly shrill "Los"-" Appar
ently there were only two fierce flashes
of the swords before the shouted "Halt" -,
of the seconds. But, this time the sur
geons hurried forward more eagerly.
Across the Bavarian's cheek, from the
ear nearly to the corner of the mouth,
there was a long, livid line, just* begin
ning to drip. The sword had cut almost
through the cheek. â¢ Both duelists- step
ped back, and the chairs were advanced
so that they could lean against the backs:
a duelist's armor Is too stiff for him to
sit down comfortably. We saw now
where all the blood came from. The doc
tors were busy with cotton, but they did
not attempt to put on bandages. We
were just beginning to feel relieved that
blood had at last been shed and that the
duel was well over with, when the com
batants again advanced, measuring a
sword's distance between them and lift
ing their blades. Again there were the
shouted signals, and the fourth round be
gan with the din of parried blows. We
had quite mistaken the nature of a Ger
man student duel In thinking that first
blood counted in any way except on the
umpire's slate.
In the fifth round the Bavarian returned
the cut, slashing the Tyrolean across the
scelp, so deeply that the blood instantly
gushed down over his forehead and from
his spectacles to the floor. Again there
was a rest on the chairs. This wound
was so deep that not only was cotton ap
plied. b'.:t a 'narrow leather " disk was
passed across it and fastened down to
the ear straps on each side. This did not
seem, however, to stop the flow of blood.
Indeed, the surgeons In these duels never
attempt to quench the wounds, for the
excellence of the performance depends on
a liberal flow of blood.
After each wound the swords were
wiped with cotton dipped in the antiseptic
solution, for the German duelist is noth
ing if he is not scientific. As the rounds
progressed we saw more clearly how the
fighting was done. There was none of the
movement and activity of the ordinary
swordsman's conflict, none of the splen
did clash and parry, or advance and re
treat. The duelists stood stock still; it
was dishonor to give way by an inch: it
was dishonor to move the head in the
least or to dodge a blow/'no matter how
severe the wound. The entire contest
consisted in holding up the sword arm,
and In so using the hand and "wrist 1 that
the point of the sword would slash the
opponent's head. Much' depends on the
strength and endurance of the right fore
arm, for upon it fall most of the blows,
and If it gives, way a "wound almost cer
tainly follows/ An' old fighter ' becomes
exceedingly strong and dextrous with
both wrist and forearm; and yet one can
not but reflect that all this training
would go for nothing if one of these duel
ists were called upon to defend himself
from an ordinary sword attack' such as
a soldier might have to meet. The whole
training is special, an outgrowth of the
student duel.
It was plain that the Tyrolean was the
better fighter of the two. The longer; the
duel progressed the fiercer became his on
slaughts, and in nearly every round he
struck the Bavarian somewhere on the
head or face. Blood was spattered
everywhere; on the floor." on the clothing
of the seconds, and on the surgeons.' As
fcr the duelists themselves, they were
literally bathed in it; it even ran down
their bare backs ui:der their armor lac
ings. Once the Bavarian- removed a bit
of tooth which had been broken off as
the Tyrolean's sword ripped through his
cheek. These things are not pleasant to
relate, nor pleasant to see, but without
them one cannot arrive at an understand
ing of what a. student duel really is. â 
Nor were the wound3 aÂ«d the blood the
least distressing features of the fight. It
was a warm morning. The room was
packed to suffocation with students, ana,
astonishing as it may seem, not one of
the windows was open, and the single
small door was blocked with spectators.
Add to the stifling atmosphere much to
bacco smoke and the rank smell of beer
and blood, and a faint conception 'of the
condition of the room may be formed.
The spectators suffered enough from t*he
heat and bad air, but it must have been
nothing as compared with the torture of
BOOK OF VERSE BY A YOUNG CALIFORNIAN.
/â vOME time ago Lionel Josephare. a
\j-i_' young San Franciscan, made his
y]fl appearance in the literary world *is
L^/ the author of a poem, "The Lion
\, .-. et the Well." His verses were
daring, original and bizarre. They gave
promise of something much better, for,
in the fantastic at least, they showed that
this ft-oung man could write with the
touch of genius and not with the labored
strain of studied- effort. . â¢
"With the holidays comes frotn the pen
of Mr. Josephare a volume of twenty
four poems under the title of "Turqujise
and Iron." In this book there is the
same promise of better thingsâ but then
the reputation of a poet cannot thrive on
promises alone. It is to be regretted
that in the case of* Mr. Josephare he does i
not cultivate a little more of the "labored 1
strain" in his work. He writes with a
youthful enthusiasm that is charming at
times, but in the undertaking of *> serious
things proves disastrous. *
He has enough disregard for conven
tionality and enough good ideas to be
benefited by. a thorough course In loglci
mathematics and English. It might be
said by the unthinking tnat work of such
prosaic character would kill the divine
genius of poesy. Michel Angelo was -the
most expert stonecutter of his day, yet
it did not kill his genius. â¢ You cannot do
good work,_wnether. you are a brick
layer, a sculptor, a painter or a poetâ
from the lowest to the highestâ unless
you understand the perfect use of the
tools that go to make your craft or pro
fession. '; -.:
True, a poet must be. born, not made.
So is the eagle born an eagle and not a
clumsy pigeon; but he must learn to fly
for all that before he attempts to soar
to empyrean heights. Mr. Josephare. has
tried to soar too young. He has all the
temperament of the poet. His form is
good, and, best of all, he has that ear
for music that gives to, his lines a
euphony, of sound so delightful , to the
readerâ that faculty so highly cultivated
by the, old Greeks, who selected and
placed their words â¢ to the best possible
advantage to impress the musical ear.
All of this can never be taken away from
him, for it is inbprn. ., -
But more Is required :of the . poet than
the niefe musical arrangement- of words.
Such, writing might please the ear

the duelists. For both of them were,
muffled in thick padded armor, especially
at the throat, where its effect would be
most painful, and at the same time, they
v.ere exercising violently under Intense
excitement.
Both dripped with perspiration and
there were frequent calls for water. The
Bavarian was ashy pale where the blood
had not blurred out all view of his face,
and it seemed at the close of every round
that he must certainly drop, but he came
up cheerfully at each cry of "Los!" and
went at the Tyrolean with vigor and
sometimes with effect. The swords flew
with incredible swiftness, and" the range
of the duelists was, by no means confined
to each other. After one of the rounds we
saw the Bavarian's second clap his hand
to the back of his head, and when he took
it away again out came the blood. It.
sometimes happens that the seconds are
as -seriously, wounded, as -the duelists
themselves. Indeed, a student, may thus

of a foreigner who understands, not
one word of the language, but wishes it
read to him for its melodious sound; but
to those who seek their pleasure in the
metrical expression of beautiful thought,
the thought must be there and it must be
evident and clear to the reader.
In his simpler verses Mr. Josephare is
of ttimes peculiarly happy in his writing,
but in lofty flights his ideas seem so
hazy that the reader is given to grave
suspicions that the-, young man has lost
all thread of reason and is. attempting
to :; make up with mere words and
rhythm' what is lacking In meaning.
At times his 'case reminds one
very much of ' the old" lady who de
cided to read the dictionary from cover to
cover, but finally gave it up, with the re
mark that the language was very, finer,
but the plot was most confusing. !
. Mr. Josephare's work is uneven. Take,
for example, his. poem "The Statue." In
that you . find some . of his best efforts
ruined by the outrageous^ abuse of words
and figures of speech that are worse than
mixed.- -Follow closely the picture that
the following lines bring to your mental
viEion: . , ..'-.'â 'â 
The room and I, with her own voice propelled,
Through earth and air extended: -
And like a boat, with onward prow unquelled
Glided when she had ended. < â¢
In the first line the word ,propel gives
the idea, of motion and you expect both
the room and the man to move at any
moment, but you 'are not prepared for
the most remarkable phenomenon indi
cated in the second line. You can.hardly
believe, that even the brain of^a maglc
wprklng poet can accomplish the feat of
"extending" the room and the man
through both earth and fair. Think of the
stretching involved in continuing the
length of that man and -his 'â  room through
the earth,' to say. nothing of continuing
the elastic figure of, speech t6 take in an
infinity of miles of air. ' " â¢ ; â --â  -
The third line brings them back with
a 'snap and starts them out "like a boat
with . onward 'prow unquelled." "-Boat"
goes very well with the "propel" of the
first line, ' and it is not beyond â¢ compre
hension, forgetting the "extended," to
imagine the man and his room sailing
away; but there again we have the "prow
unquelled." You can quell an insurrec
tion, or. a tumult \of your soul, or a fire;
but "quelling" the prow of a boat is a
new one In the generally accepted sense
of the word. It rhymes beautifully with
propelled and is fine reading, but "the
plot is most confusing."
The last line changes the figure in the
twinkling of an eye and tells us that after
all possibly the man and his room were
not "extended," and the prow of , the boat
did not even need to be : Vunquelled," but
merely "glided? safely into port.
I It is hardly fair in this review of Mr.
Josephare's book to bring in a verse from
the master pen of Shelley, but some lines
.occur to me from. "Prometheus Unbound"
that are quite apropos â lines that express
beautifully that thought ..which 'Mr. Jos
cphare'mangles: u -
My soul is an enchanted boat, I , â¢
â  â â -â¢â  Which like a sleeping swan doth float
Upon the sliver waver of thy sweet singing;
. And" thine doth like an angel sit
'Beside the helm conducting it, .
Whilst all the winds with melody are ringing,-
It .'seems to float ever, for ever, ' . ' ". /
. Upon that many winding river, _ ' '/.'â 
Between mountains, woods, abysses, '
A .paradise of wildernesses!
Till, like one in Elumber. bound, < -}â

Into a eea profound ! of ever-spreading sound.
Here is another, bit from the same poem
C;\ noâ she said, she who had lately, sunsâ
obtain a very conspicuous and honorable
scar without having to go to the trouble
and pain of a regular duel.
At last," at the end of fifteen rounds, tho
duelists were led back and their armor
â¢was loosened so that they. could sit down.
We were just congratulating: ourselves
that it .was well over with, when we were
informed that this was only the first half.
There were fifteen rounds more to fight.
The surgeons were very busy now for a
time, and the fellow corpsmen of . each
duelist crowded up to give him advice as
to how he could best defend himself or
overreach his opponent. The Intermission
lasted only'a.'few minutes, and then, at
the cry of the umpire, the men came back
to their," posts. .Both walked steadily; it is'
a dishonor to 'waver or flinch. And then
the hacking began again. '
One of the oddest phases of the duel wa3
the- nonchalant attitude of the students
who came as spectators. At no time -was
there a cheer, or protest, or .any other
With fertilizing grief thou art combined.
And thence thy vision sprung.
With too much world our faces are unkind;
Art Is the countenance of a lovely mind.
And thy courageous mind hath wildly hung
To heaven's ever-swinging chandelier.
But now from it are thy poor fingers wrung.
And thou art here. '
Read it and see If- you can get any
sense out of it. The figure of the mind
personified and hanging to a chandelier is
so absolutely silly and in such bad taste
in a poem of serious character that one
wonders how. on the same'page and from
the same hand we can | find verses as
pleasing as the ones immediately preced
ing thia poetical daub. 'Here are the lines
referred to:
Once mOre away! -
No more, with gaudy sound, my soul betray;
No sound shall kiss or kill my sin to-day.
. My obstinate regret
Still does desire to fret.
Music with it provokes a gentle fray
That makes th_e soul forget.
It tells the soul that sorrow Is' no debt;
With sound for prayer, the soul forgets to pray.
Thereat, again I found myself at home;
The singer sang no more.
But told me not to let my fancy roam
Beyond the human door.
She told me heaven had no bluer skies,
- No gladder golden floor, ..
Than I may see with still my earthly eyes,
.'/.â¢And might have seen before.
But" oh. while we are learning
The meaning of our yearning.
Who has not wept while heaven did refute
His statue's claW -to godly attribute?
Since no't with" entire godliness,
Did God the human visajfe knock.
Can human hammers, thinking to excess.
Inscribe upon' a; rock
Divinity which they do not possess
Within their own diviner God-made stock? '
That line.- "With sound for prayer, the
soul forgets to pray," Is", good. The
thought , is well expressed, and in tho
thought Itself there is meat for consid
eration. The idea is not a new one. for
we find in "Hamlet" the prayer of the
King and his closing words:
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below;
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
I . am not accusing Mr. Josephare of
plagiarism. It would be difficult to find
any thought that had not been "brought
out in some way in the great works of

manifestation of enthusiasm or excite

laughter over the retort of one of the sec
onds as to a charge of foul. Many of the
students had brought their wooden beer
mugs Into the dueling Inn with them. anJ
they could be seen drinking from tl^ie tc*
time, and even proposing in a loud voice
the health of some one across the room.
A barmaid was continually pushing her
way 'In and out among the crowd, some
times at the very elbows- of the seconds.
and once we saw her coming into the
room with a plate of sausage, cabbage
and rye bread. Some one had actually
ordered lunch in- this room of blood. â ; *Â«
The closing fifteen rounds dragged
themselves slowly along'. They, were even
more bloody than the first. It was diffi
cult to understand how the Bavarian
stood It to the end, for nearly every round
brought him a new wound or laid open
an old one. Toward the end he began to
pant with heat and exhaustion, and one
of the surgeons examined hte heart with
tome care; and evidently feeling that
there was danger from this source he wet.
a towel in cold water and placed it over
the heart and just under the edge of. the
armor, and then the fighting went for
ward again with its usual vigor.
At the close of the duel, astonishing as
it may seem, both contestants- were able
to walk upstairs to the dressing-room, al
though the Bavarian looked every mo
ment as if he would go down. His appear
ance Is not to be described in this place.
An hour later we saw the Tyrolean walk

bandages. He had not been seriously
wounded except for the single cut' on 'top
of his head. The Bavarian did not ap

Bachelor Bigotries.
Any one caring to enjoy a little laughter
con indulge himself by reading a small
volume called "Bachelor Bigotries," by
some authoress l/i this Instance unknown
to fame. It is a compilation from differ
ent writers, arranged to form a calendar
of the year. The selections are short,
varying from a sentence in length to a
short paragraph. The subject of most of
the selections is either woman, love pr
marriage. Particular stress is laid upon
the disadvantages of a personal experi
ence of any of the three. Still the satire
Is in humorous vein and some amiable re
flections are mixed with it. The following
selections will give an idea of the char
acter of the book:

The Golden Chimney.
An interesting tale for the young has
been written by Elizabeth Gerberding and
called "The Golden Chimney." It re
counts the adventures of a young boy,
Ben Ralston, in his, struggle to lay the
foundation of his fortune. Ralston has
been left an orphan with only a few hun
dred dollars with which to support and
educate himself. One day while he and
a young cousin, Beth, are wandering near
the ruins of an old smelting works the
latter suggests to him the Idea of mining
the works for the gold which may be left
among the soot and rubbish. Ben acts
upon Beth's suggestion and invests all of
his money In preparations for seeking the
treasure. Ben's venture leads him into
difficulties which at first promise to de
stroy air of his hopes of success, but he
surmounts them all and the end of tho
story leaves him the possessor of a cap
ital sufficiently large to enable him to
obtain the college education which ho
covets.
The book is illustrated by several fine
photographs by Dr. Arnold Genthe. (Pub

Literary Notes.
Book News for December reflects the
Christmas spirit as Well as the literary
spirit of the time. There are jnore pTc
tures than usual; 1 a page is filled wUh
Christmas poetry, and there is an Unus
ually full list of the best books of the
day, which will be helpful to those in
quest of gifts in the book line. Robert
W. Chambers is the subject of the month-
Shakespeare. In this connection It might
be mentioned that Mr. Josephare's work
shows rather an inattention to the writ
ings of great poets. It is well to be orig
inal, but experience in what has been done
before you. can do no man harm.
Some of his best work in the present
volume is found in the more unpreten
tious of his sonnets, take for example
this one:
TO MY INKWELL.
Thou blotty bottle, bottle stained and Brim,
Thou imp, thou gnome, a moody friend art
thovj.
And yet thyself I would not trade, I vow.
For golden Ink-decanter with a rim
Of pearls and decorations wreathed and slim.
Now tell me, ugly boy with Inky brow.
Of some unwritten thoughts, which you
allow *
To dream awhile within your tranquil brim. â 
How many black . imaginings are there
Waiting to crawl out for my livelihood?
Phantasmas. whims, a poefs morbid ware.
Capricious thoughts, perhaps misunderstood?
All liquid yet and blended In their well;
Some will be born: how many, who can tell?
When Mr. Josephare comes down â  to
earth he shows signs of most promise.
And he ruins what he intends to be in
spiring. Eagles do not crawl. The things
that do crawl are generally more repul
sive than impressive.
As can be seen from his picture, Mr.
Josephare is still a very young man and
therefore the good work that he has done
is all the more remarkable. It is also an
indication of what we may hope for from
him in the future. . At present he is try
ing to do too much without the proper
groundwork and experience. He" should
confine himself to verses like the follow
ing until his wings have . grown - enough
that he may fly without bumping hi3 head
on the ground: -

No one who cares for art. and whi
chances to read in the December Mc-
Clure's Mr. La Farge's first article on the
old masters wiU fall to Tead the rest as
they appear in McClure's Magazine dur
ing the coming year. The author la both
a great artist and a profound student of
art. and the series is therefore bound to
constitute the most Important contribu
tion to art criticism for some time to come.
For the importance of such, work is meas
ured by the breadth of its appeal. Other
great artists and critics have written on
the subject, and what they have said is
forgotten, because It was addressed to a
limited audience of those who have made
a life-long study of the subject. Mr. La
Farge knows better than that. No one
can fall to understand every word of these
essays, but there is no shallowness in
their simplicity.
The form of the essays is the very best
as it is also the most difficult; that, name
ly, of the critical short life. Mr. La
Farge knows how to steer successfully
between the Scylla of barren encyclopedi
cal facts and the Charybdis of critical
formulae, detached in their application
from biography and history. The person
ality of the artist is~ projected on the
background of his times, and the influ
ence of each on the other 13 carefully
traced in every one of his great paintings
and sculptures. Of the tint Illustrations
which accompany the text It is only nec
essary to say that they are fully worthy
of it.

Â«yy ?CD tjott the -wheel of fortune has

Often has Dame Fate, who turns this

give a smile of approval to genius In the
realm of music and to the devotees of
drama. In fact, she has discovered so
much cleverness on this far end of the
globe that looking for her has become al
most a habit. But seldom has she deigned
to notice the â¢workers In the field of art.
Truth to tell, seldom has she had occa

She has apparently been abroad, this

California, a San Francisco girl, Matilda
Lotz, haa been declared by the critics of
art In Paris to be the second Rosa Bon
heur of the world. That statement trans
lated and paraphrased means that she Is
to-day the greatest woman painter of an
imals and of animal life living.
The world of art has taken off its hat

this American woman has taken her
THE SUNtfAY CALL.'
place, and the artists abroad 1 and those
who have seen her most recent work here
â¢are talcing off their hats to Matilda Lotz.
Miss Lotz is a â¢Southern girl, born in Ten
nessee, but a California^ by adoption, for
she was brought to California while only
a babe In arms, so she claims, to be a na
tive of our State.
The early education of this artist who
portrays "animal life with such -realism
was gleaned f here, where in the school
room tiae little miss was at once the de
light and despair of her teacher. De
light, because she was so deliciously droll:
despair, because, like all artists, she re
fused point blank to cudgel her brain
over the mathematical problem whether
Jwo'and two-made four or six. She pre-
f erred instead to , draw. On ; every . book
and blank leaf, every piece of paper were
picturesâ landscapes, houses, cows, horses
âanything and everything in the way of
Pictures, but Tier pet subject seemed to be
pigs. On the margin of her arithmetic,
all around; the pictures of i the village
blacksmith in the Second Reader, were
pigsâ whole; processions of' them, tum
-bling, scrambling, pigs en masse, pigs sin
gle; and ' other animals, too, j some of
them entirely unknown to the world of
science, strange lookingjereatures, but all
in proportion, were drawn.
Later, when her mother began; to add
inches. 'to the length of her skirt and she
tied blue ribbons on her dignified mar
guerite braids, her chief delight was to
visit the. Zoo. The old Woodward Gar
dens was a favorite resort and there she
sketched lions in all their glory. .It was
said that even at that time, and this qual
ity is now a very pronounced fact, she
seemed to posse'ss a sort of magnetic in
fluence over, the ' animal kingdom and
could, and' frequently did. put her hands
"through the bars to pat the beasts with
perfect safety.
As the years passed and her love for art
did not abate, it was decided by her par
ents to give her a course of instruction.
.Here- in San Francisco she studied in the
old school of design, under Virgil Will
iams, and immediately made great prog
ress. At an exhibition of the local artists
her picture of a horse captured the gold
medal offered by Jlr.v William Alvord as
a prize for general excellence-' Then un
der the 'advice of Mr. -Williams and a
number of the local critics the young ar
tist was. sent to Paris, where, after a
year's sjtudy, she had two pictures . ad
mitted at the Salon.
In Paris Miss Lotz studied for scrhe
time- in the- Julian" Academy, later under
Van Marcke, but her work, unlike that
of Van Marcke, who is renowned as a
colorist. seems to be influenced more by
that of Rosa Bonheur. who, from the first,
was to Miss Lotz a faithful friend and a
valuable adviser. Up to the day cf Miss
Bonheur" s death these two artists were
' tirm friends and daily associates. Miss
Lotz, like/her friend, early decided not to
wed, .fancying tt?2t a divided attention
would 'be' a drawback in her chosen and
miich'-lnvert art, so. while she always has
many friends and la not an old maid la
any sense of the word, she Is still single.
Moreover, In spite of her artistic temper
ament, there has been no .rumor oÂ£ a ro
mance.
The romance cf her life is perhaps cen
tered in her extensive interests, her trav
els, her several studios and her numerous
pets of beautiful horses and dogs.
The pictures from Miss Lotz's brush are
all painted in a low tone; the very high
est quality being perhaps their absolute
truth to nature. Of the two principal de
partments of art comprehended in the
idealistic and the naturalistic school*
Miss Lk>tz belongs decidedly to the
latter. Nature seems to be her
inspiration; she loves the field, the
mountain, the wood; she loves animal
life, her horses, dogs and oxen are her
personal friends and to their ears are con
fided all her joys and troubles, all her
hopes and disappointments. And they,
coming under this spell of human affec
tion, stand docile and content while her
ready brush makes rapid strokes, trans
ferring their grace and beauty and their
atmosphere of utter peace 'to the canvas.
This is where her work excels, In its
atmospheric o.ualities. There is a very
vibration of the- air. a wealth of feeling:,
a rare spirit of nature. Her oxen stand
ont from the canvas in bold relief, yet
not in harsh outline. They appear almost
as the natural eye would see them in" the
field of yellowing grass. That she Is ac
complished in drawing and anatomy is
apparent. As a coiorist she does not ex- (
eel. but in boldness of execution cannot Da
surpassed. . '
'Miss Lotz paints like a man; there is a
strength and vigor, a broadness in her
work' that in some instances equals in tha
particular style that of Bonheur, who al
ways worked out the detail with a little
more linish to get the same effect. An
other' marked characteristic 'in painting
animals, and that which undoubtedly adds
to their natural appearance, is that of
preserving the likeness of each particular
animal.. Miss Lots likes to study the in
dividuaf physiognomy of a dog. an ox or
a horse, just as a. portrait artist would
do to get the exact expression of a sub
ject.
Thirf artist in her sketching tours
through Kuri'Pi baa made many friends
and has from time to time been presented
with t;ome valuable animals. As she
likes to kee:> them all. she has now in
Paris besides a studio almost a complete
menagerie.
The oops in this croup illustrated are
all gifts and personal pets and are also, I
presume, accomplished models. Ml as
Lotz' work-in panning do^s Svjen.s to u<s
influenced more by the English school
and the work of Sir Kdwin Landseer.
Kach year Hiss Lota sends to the Salon
and has received from that high authori
ty much gratifying praise and several
medals.
While dogs and oxen are, her favorita
bubjects she has also painted many horses,
malting some special studies in the racing
stable of the Duke and Duchess of Port
land, whose country estate lies near
Paris. One of her best known pictures is
that of the head and bust of a magnifi
cent St. Bernard, which was painted for
the Baroness Rothschild. The noble ani
mal became so attached to the artist that
he was afterward presented to SIIs.i
Lotz by the Baroness and is now one of
her most cherished pets and most intelli
gent models. _
Last year Miss Lotz. finding herself
failing in .health, decided to take -re3t
and' recreation in' a trip up the Nile,
where she made studies of the came's
and also painted some in landscape and
architecture, although In this line her
work doe3 not compare with her animal
pictures. After in her travtls she
stopped for a time In Budapest, whers
the Count Esterhazj-, the head of the
Government, the ruler next in power to
the. Emperor Francis Joseph, admired her
work so much that he ordered the erec
tion of a. studio for her especial benefit.
The studio is now locked up, awaitins he
return to that country. Emperor Francis
Joseph save her several commissions atnÂ»
now has a number of Miss Lotz' pictures.
Mrs. Phebe Hearst, who for many years
has been among the first to reeoVn ie
talent among our American girls, has al
ways been much interested < in the prog
ress of this artist. Two canvases, one 1 a
Jersey calf, another of hunting clogs,
which now hang in the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art. were purchased and pre
sented to the gallery by Mrs. Hearst.
â  Although Miss Lotz has been sixteen
years absent from her native land tt >is
said that she is still as patriotic as ever
and some San . Francisco friends who
spent last year abroad remarked upon
her observance of the good old American
Independence day. In whatever part of
Europe she may be, when the Fourth ot
July comes around her studio is always
gayly decorated in Uncle Sam's colors
There Is a possibility that in this com
ing year Miss Lotz may return for a few
months to her. old home In California
where she will make some studies of our

OBSCURITY
UPPOSB that all the new houses
\q^ of San Francisco could be knock-
V~ 1 ed over as If they were toys cf
wood; and that in their places
could be Bet up the homes of the
people who have made history here on
ecr tittle peninsula.
Thea you would never dream for a mo
ment that you were- in San Francisco, for
never did a city change by such swift
magic as this.
The distinctive type of the early day
house was a rambling- wooden structure,
either cottage form or square, with bal
conies above and below. Of this class, in
the northern part of the city, were the
homes of General J. P. Haven on Pow
ell street, near Unfon (he was the well
known "funny man" of the town and one
of the first major generals of San Fran
cisco's militia); Colonel J. D. Fry, on
Pacific street, near Mason; Judge H. T.
Thornton and his son-in-law. Judge
James D. Thornton, recently of the Su
preme Court, on Green street, near Stock
ton; S. M. Wilson, also on Green street,
in whose house were born his numerous
eons, several of whom are present legal
luminaries; George Hearst, on Lombard
fctrcet; W. II. V. Cronise. and William
Sharon on Green street.
Although the homes of our early day
residents were scattered all over the city
of that period, the fashionable portion of
the north side of the town was beyond
question that part of Stockton street ly
ing between Clay and Green and its im
mediate vicinity. Many of the houses
are still in existence, the buildings look-
Ing, in the main, outwardly as they did
fcrty years ago. It is in the interiors
that the most startling changes have
taken place, and to one who- may reta'n
pleasant recollections of the home life
and hospitality of that quarter at that
period a visit there now is an actual
f hock. Outward and visible signs of Chi
nes* occupancy are on every hand, and
the dilapidation which follows in its train
is but too evident. Take, for example,
what was the handsome, imposing home
of Thomas O. J-arkin,*on the east side
of Stockton street, between Pacific and
Jackson. It was one -of the city's most
elegant residences in the early sixties,
and in its spacious parlors was married, .
In 18G2, Mr. Larkin's only daughter, Caro
lina., to Sampson Tarns. Miss Larkin en-
Joyed the distinction of being the first
white child born of American parents in
6an Francisco. It is now a Chinese lodg
ing-house, -with scarcely a. whole window
pace to be seen In the entire structure.
On the opposite side of the street other
prominent early day homes have met a
similar fate. Here stand a couple of
brick houses. In one of them dwelt â
about 13G0â Judge J. P. Hoge and his fam
ily. The twin house was occupied by
Judge M. Hall McAllister of the United
States Circuit Court and his large fam
ily of sons and their wives. Mrs. McAl
lister the eldef was the soul of hospital
ity, and the McAllister house was one of
the most delightful in town to visit; the
entertainments were legion. Next in oc
cupancy came the French Consul, M.
Gautier, and his family, who kept up the
horse's reputation for brilliant festivi
ties until the recall of the Consul by his
Government. The first French consulate
was on the corner of Jackson and Mason
streets. It was a square three-storied
house, the lower story far below the
grade and most dilapidated in appear
aice.
A third example of wreck and ruin in
the vicinity of Stockton street can be seen
In what was known in 1S55 as the Gwln
hcuse. on the north side of Jackson street,
rear Stockton. Jt was one of the most
substantial in the city at that date and
in it Mrs. Gwin held almost regal sway,
eurrounded by the leaders of the Demo
cratic party and numerous satellites. It
vtas while living here that Dr. Gwjn was
re-elected to the United States Senate.
G. W. Guthrie was the. next occu
pant of the Gwin house, which was soon
Â£.fter purchased and improved by Dr. Hf.
K. Tch.nd and lived in by him and his
family for a decade or more. The house
is now the headquarters of a Chinese
laundry; in fact, the Chinese have ab
eorbed this locality In its entirety and the
old homes of the elder Dr. J. D. Whitney,
John Middleton, the pioneer auctioneer;
Dr. R. T. Maxwell, John Sime, the banker.
tinC others are now occupied by that race.
1 here are. however, two exceptions in this
block; one. the home of Captain Roberts,
en the corner of Washington street, and
the other adjoining it, the early home of
Captain F. W. Macondray," the pioneer tea
raprchant.
A building which has seen many vicissi
tudes still stands on the southwest corner
of Powell and John streets. In it were
held the first services of Grace Episcopal
Church, under the especial charge of the
late Bishop Kip, and when that congrega
tion moved into the newer church edifice
near by its Interior was remodeled into
a dwelling house and was for many years
tlie abode of J. B. Hag-gin and family.
To them succeeded as Joint occupants the
families of J. 0. Duncan and Myers P.
Truett. and at present the lower portion
1Â« usÂ«?d as a grocery store. It was in a
little house Just round the corner on John

corner of Powell and Jackson streets and
adjoining Grace Church was the pretty
white cottage of, Captain R. J. Vande
water. It has since been partly rebuilt
and at the present time is used as a drug
store.
Another house with a history in this vi
cinity was built In the early fifties by
Fletcher M. Haight on the south side of
Jackson street between Mason and Tay
lor. Sand hills abounded there'abouts at
that period and each particular piece of
lumber used in its construction was hauled
to the spot by means of a rope attached
to It at one end and to a horse at the
other. It might well have been called
building under difficulties. All of Mr.
Halght's daughters were married under
this parental roof, and then he sold the
house to J. B. Haggin, who resided there
with his family until the present hand
some abode was built on Taylor street
The Haight house was then moved from
its old locality and - now, standing on
Washington street nearly back to back
with Its old site, is the home of Lawyer
A. D. Splivalo and his family.
When F. L. a. Pioche, the French
banker, built his elegant new residence
(then the finest brick dwelling house in
the city) on Stockton street near Clay it
surely never entered his brain that ere
many years It would be used as a hos
pital and finally become the Chinese con
sulate, with the heathen "washmen" sur
rounding It on all sides. Pioche was a
man who dearly loved a good dinner; his
chef was a cordon bleu, his wines were re
nowned for their vintage and the large
dining room on the lower floor of the
three-storied building was weekly the
scene of elaborate dinner parties.
A queer looking little iron cottage on
Stockton street near California, was for
many years in the latter fifties the home
of Henry B. Willis, the Pacific Mail
steamship agent, and another odd looking
little box of a place next Starr King's
Church on Stockton street near Sacra
mento was the'abode at E. W â  Joice, the
well-known notary. About 1S57 Julia Dean
Hayne, the actress, bought and llve&Mn
the small cottage perched on top of an
almost inaccessible sand hill near the cor
ner of California and Powell. streets, aft
erward the home of C. Temple Emmett,
the lawyer.
Of the two extremities of the town it
Is a question which It is the most sadder
for an old timer to contemplate. The erst
while fashionable quarter at the north end
of the city has been absorbed by the Chi
nese, that on the south seems to have
fallen Into decay.
What was always - considered a -great
piece of vandalism by the property owners
on Rincon Hill was the cutting through
of Second street: so many pretty homes
stood upbn its lines which were ruined by
the act and disappeared from sight, while
those that remain in the vicinity are but
shadows of the past. The handsome
house of General Henry W. Halleck,
which stood part way up the hill above
Folsom on the west side, was the first
to go, its site being â  now occupied by a
brewery. (,
i farther uo the EfiT Â«as ih'e elegant res
idence of Bishop Kip, which actually top
pled over and fell into the excavation.
One of the mosfc noted residences in this
vicinity was the home of Thomas H.
Selby. Built above the grade on Harri
son street (or, rather, the street was
graded down from the, land upon which It
was built early in the fifties), access to it
was gained by a series of long flights of
stairs, and as the Selbys entertained a
great deal these stairs were always cano
pied and looked like! a succession of tun
nels winding up thei side of the hill. â¢ The
house Itself was a two-storied double
frame^ structure, to which some time
about'the middle sixties was added^a spa
cious ballroomâ the only one that Embel
lished a private dwelling in the city,
which was the scene of many brilliant
entertainments, such as the reception
given in honor of the Japanese Embassa
dor, Iwakura; the weddings of Clara Sel
by and A. J. Ralston and of Cornelia Sel
by and Captain Kempt of. the navy, to
say nothing t>f the yearly grand ball and
innumerable smaller receptions that Mrs.
Selby gave each month during the sea
son. . â¢
On the southwest corner of Harrison
and Second streets stood a large frame
house which was built in 1860 by Commo
dore R. C. Ogden for his family home,
but upon the marriage of F. W. Ather
ton's daughter tp Fred Macondray he was
induced to sell it to Mr. Atherton, who
made it a wedding, gift to the bride"..
When the hill was\cut through the lot
upon which It stood partly crumbled
away and the house was' moved to South
Park, where it was afterward for a tlrao
the abode of the Gwin family. There it
still stands, but bears evidence of the de
day that one familiar with the early day
life of that locality detects so readily.
South Park was designed and laid out
about 1E53, after the plan of English cres
cents, by the late George Gordon, one of
our best known early pioneers, and it was
for many years the nucleus around which
gathered a goodly portion of ; the social
system of that period. Within Its limits
were the dwellings of the founder, George
Gordon'; Commodore . Watklns, Horace P.
Janes, John H. Redlngtori, Lloyd Tevis,
Isaac Friedlander, Charles de. Ro, Cap
tain Richard Whiting, Alexander Forbes,
the steamship agent; Russian Consul
Kcstrlmetlnoff; James Bell, founder of
the house, of Falkner, Bell & : Co.; Dr. R.
P. Ashe (father of Porter), George C.
Johnson, Mrs. - Martha Ritchie, James
Otis, William M. Lent, etc. Thte-colonyâ
for It was oneâ far removed from tho
other parts of the city, was very sociable
within Its own circle, and among others
boasted three young ladies whom one of
the wits of the day dubbed "the world,
the flesh and the devil." They were Miss
Lottie Hall, Miss Rosa Gore â  and Miss
Patsie Ritchie, who .were the trio thus
nicknamed. South Park still remaips,;but
fashion has long since. deserted It. ; .
Another of the residences of the South
Side which saw many vicissitudes, was
the one which until lately stood 'on the
north side of Bryant street, near Third.
Originally the early day home of Colonel
B.-.F. Washington, one of the Collectors
of the Port of San Francisco; it came

into the possession of Louis McLane, who,
purchasing the adjoining property, re
built and^ altered th*e house and laid out
the grounds in an extensive flower gar
den, until the place was regarded as one
of the prettiest residences In the city.
When the McLanes ; removed East the
place was rented to "' Isaac Friedlander,
who still further improved it. Within Ua
doors hospitality reigned supreme, and
elaborate entertainments were of fre
quent occurrence. Perhaps the grandest
wedding that ever took place In our social
â world, was -celebrated in this house, when

wife of Dr.. A. J. Bowie's eldest son, A:

â McLanes, .when, the Nevada Bank was
opened, they 'again took' possession "of

as many vicissitudes as any in the city
and has come to be regarded as a most
unlucky piece of property to its owners.
It was originally the modest littjje cottage
of Captain G. W. P. Bissel, standing in
the midst of a pretty flower garden. At
his death it became the property of the
man known as "Ophir" Woodworth, he
having made a large fortune in the stock
of that mine. Moving the cottage to the
rear -of the grounds, he built in front of
It a very pretentious mansion as a home
for himself, and family, and while living
there the marriage of his daughter took
place. She was then quite an heiress. She
married Dr. W. H. Bruner. Time in its
flight brought failure and ruin to Mr.
Woodworth, who sold the property to Mil
ton .9. Latham, then in the zenith of his
wealth and fame, who still further im
proved it, adding the large library, which
was the great feature of the house.
Here Mr. Latham entertained in lavish
style; here occurred the death of his first
wife, Sophie, daughter of Dr. Louis A.
Birdsall, and a remarkably brilliant wo
man, and here also was held the marriage
reception after his second bridal to Miss
Mollie - McMullin, one i of San Francisco's
belles in .the sixties. Evil, days also be
fell Mr. Latham, and upon his failure the
house was bought by Senator William
Sharon as a wedding present to his daugh
ter, Mrs. Frank Newlands. But when she
died two years later! the place ceased to
bo looked upon as a desirable residence,
especially as fashion had j commenced to
seek other localities, so, after passing
through various hands, It is now a lodg
ing house. ' . â¢ â¢
Some of the smaller streets, such as Te
; hama, I Minna arid Natoma, were in early
days considered among the fashionable lo
calities arid- had as residents the families
of Eugene Casserly, Morton Cheeseman,
T. J. Poulterer and. others. The cottage
wherein William F. Babcock and his fam
ily, for so many years made their home
on Essex- street once stood In the midst
of a beautiful? flower .garden,, but, alas,

and while living there they entertained on
a lavish scale. The house passed into the
.hands of: Judge' H. A. Lyons in 1871 and
is now used as a lodging house.
The first-pretentious home of W. C. Ral
ston, built during the middle sixties, was
on Fremont street near Firsthand herein
he began the series of lavish entertain
ments which afterward made his name
so famous in connection with Belmont.
The handsome residence of Mrs. A. M.
Parrott on Sutter street is one of tha
it-stances of stately oak produced by the
tiny acorn. Sutter street during the mid
dle fifties was beyond Powell street an
almost impassable sand waste, ungraded,
and consequently nearly devoid of build
ings. AJmost the last dwelling-house on
the south side near Mason street was a
l'.jile four-room cottage, standing in the
middle of a sand lot. This was the home
of Lawyer W. H. Sharp, his wife and
young children^ In the course of a few
years, about 1S60, the street, being "then
graded, he built an addition of several
rooms In front of the little cottage? mak
ing it quite a presentable house. This was
the one he sold to Senator Sharon, who,
"about 1S73, occupied it with his family,
and here was soon after given the grand
ball which celebrated the entree of the
Sharon family into San Francisco society.
The house was not large* enough, however,
to suit the Sharon ambition, so after pur
chasing the adjoining property on tho
cast Mr. Sharon built the large addition
to his dwelling which made the house on*
of the most commodious in the city. Tha
first use made of the elegant, spacious par
lors was upon the occasion of the marriage
of his eldest daughter, ( Clara, to Frank
Newlands. This was the first social func
tion in which enormous wealth was lavÂ«
ishly displayed and marked a new era in
entertainment among us. The parlors
were next thrown open to friends when
the body, of Mrs. Sharon lay in state be
foie the funeral, when the floral decora
tions were, almost as great a feature of
elaborate display as at the bridal. Not
very long afterward the failure of the
Bank of California caused Mr. Sharon to
transfer the property to W. S. O'Brien,
who placed It at the disposal of his sister,
Mrs. Maria Coleman. whose pretty twin
daughters speedily became leading, belles
in society. A couple of years later the
rooms which were thronged for the mar
riage festivities of Miss Sharon once more
.were, filled with wedding guests, the bride
being Miss Cecilia Coleman and the jtroom
Harty May. After the death of Mr.
O'Brien Mrs. Coleman, to whom he willed
the property, sold .It to Mrs. Parrott, who
during the winter season generally resides
there surrounded by her large family, and
since her occupancy It has been the scene
of many brilliant hospitalities.
There wer/s but* two houses on the north
side of Sutter^treet In the block between
" Powell and Mason in the middle fifties.
One. at the corner of Powell street, was
a two-story' tottage belonging to W. S.
Clark; the other, ' a double two-storied
, house on the corner of Mason, was the
; home of Isaac Friedlander. Between the
-two was a' deep gully, long flights of stops
for, pedestrians reaching down and up on
"either. side. There was no attempt at a~
roadway, and vehicles .were an unknown
quantity^ thereabouts. The. Friedlander
house was afterward occupied . by John
Young of New Almaden fame and his
wife. Her pretty sisters, the Misses Walk-

Youngs succeeded the Rev. Dr. Ver llehr
ind his family, and it was during hia oc
cupancy that his only daughter, the beau
tiful ( bionde Gertrude, became the wife of
J. M. Seawell.one of our present Superior
Judges, and the beauty of the bridal party
as they appeared at the reception, held in
the long: parlors of the old house, was the
topic of the hour, The. bride, a perfect
blonde, looked as if she had stepped from
the frame of one of the old family por
traits, which formed a background for t)6s
party, and her two bridesmaids, Miss Sa
rah Poett and Miss Ella Maxwell, were
perfect specimens of the brunette type of
loveliness. The old house is still extant,
but it has been turned around and now
faces on Mason street, a short distance
above Sutter.
The furnishing of our early day homes
was of a very different character from
that of the present and seldom varied
from black walnut upholstered In hair
cloth cr red plush with mahogany frames.
Of this latter description was that which
the long drawing room of the early day.
Friedlander home on Sutter street con
tained, quite in contrast to the pale blue
brocade and gilt furniture of their ele
gant parlor in the McLane mansion on
Bryant street. Apropos of furniture, when
Senator Sharon finished and furnished his
Sutter-street house in 1S74 the cost of the
parlor upholstery alone exceeded the sum
of $30,000.
On the block between Powell and Stock
ton there were but three dwelling houses
on the north side of Sutter street. The
large frame house on *he corner of Sut
ter and Stockton was built early in the
fifties by Lucien Herman and was one
of the handsomest in the city for many
years. Dr. Bowie purchased the property
in 1856 and resided in It until about 1S70.
when, after being partially destroyed by
fire, it was remodeled and became a beer
hall, known as the Vienna Gardens, where
concerts were given nightly to the accom
paniment of lager and tobacco. Adjoining
it on the west was one of the cottage
houses which were brought here around
the Horn and put together with screws,
not "a nail being used In its â construction.
It was the property of B. Davidson, Roth
chllds' agent, and to the original housa
Mr. Davidson added a couple of wtng3.
one of which he used as a billiard room.
Being a lover of floriculture, he laid out
the extensive grounds which surrounded
his house in flowers and foliage, which
were brought to such a state of perfection
that it was a noted place In the young;
city. The property passed Into the hands
of the Congregation Emanu-El In 1363.
and upon it was erected the present syna
gogue, tho price paid for the land being
about $12,000. The house was then re
moved to Ellis street Just above Mason,
where it now stands, the main house by
Itself and the two wings forming- another
house, used as a blacksmith's shop be
low, with lodgings in the rooms above.
The third house on the block next west
of the Davidson domain was built and
lived in first by Abel Guy, then by F. Cav
allier, both well-known old pioneers, as
well as the third resident," Julius May,
joint manager of Rothschilds* banking
house of B. Davidson & Co.
A house which retains much of Its old
time appearance still occupies its original
location on the southwest corner of. Stock
ton and California. It was built by
Colonel J. D. Stevenson in the early fifties
and was the scene for many- years of. a
great deal of hospitality, the large draw
ing: room to the right of entrance betas
a marvel for size and "Just the thing" for
dancing. It is now and has for a
decade or more been used as a lodging
house. Across Stockton street and ad
joining Grace Church on the south Is the
large double house of Antolne Borel.
which looks precisely as It did when built
thirty years ago by "William Barren, and
occupied by him until bis death, the joint
occupants with him being his brother Jo
seph, and Thomas Bell. Mr. Barron' s bach
elor parties were renowned, and tho ball
given by him" In celebration of the mar
riage of the'eldest Miss Wallrtnahaw and
Sam Price, an early day notable, was
the most brilliant private affair ever given
then In San Francisco and would com
pare favorably with the most elaborate
function of tha present day.
Our early day residents had two otrt
of-town resorts, to which of a pleasant
afternoon many teams found their way.
They were on the route to the beach,
which, even before the building: of the
Cliff House Road, was the popular drive
of the day. One was the Ocean House,
the other the Lake House, which was
prettily situated on the banksi of the La
goon near the Ocean Beach. The Lake
House was purchased some time near the
end of the fifties by John 3Jidd!eton. the
pioneer auctioneer, and he moved It Into
town to "occupy his lot on Second street
near South Park, and it became his fam
ily home. Indeed It was owing to the po
sition of this home that Mr. Middleton
was â¢ induced to engineer the - cutting
through of the Second-street hill which he
so successfully accomplished. A house in
the Western Addition which looks to-day
exactly as It did forty years ago Is that
where Samuel Holladay and his family
reside; the only difference is that when
first built there was not a vestlga of foli
age around or near it and not a house
within a dozen blocks* ; What a contrast

palatial homes in the neighborhood oc

LASHED to the masthead of a
ship, one hundred and thirty-live
feet above the heaving sea. with
the wind j blowing a regular
â 'shiver my timbers" gale, Mclvin Van
iman. a plucky photographer of San
Francisco, retently accomplished a tri
umph in securing: tbe largest and most
beautiful harbor-city view of Honolulu
ever obtained. And thereby hangs a
tale that is of interest to photographers
and laymen alike.
Mr. Vaniman. after years spent in ex
perimenting, has reached a point in
photography which has long been
striven for unsuccessfully. He has suc
ceeded in making a continuous pano
ramic picture 20 by 72 inches in size on
one plate. The original sizes of the il
lustrations used in this article are 16 by
48 inches. The picture of Honolulu
was taken from the top of a pole 107
Â£eet high.
The other, snowing a stretch of city
streets reaching from, the Emporium to
the Hopkins Art Institute, was taken
from the Lcepalmer building. They
are taken on one plate, the camera
lenses having been made from special
designs in Germany. Until now these
large photographs have always been
taken in .sections and joined together.
Mr. Vaniman followed up this
method and used all of the various pan
orama cameras. In the joining process
all negatives have to be printed exactly
alike, the same time of exposure, etc.,
to make the whole picture perfect. He
tried enlarging small negatives.- but
found that unsatisfactory. Then he set
about making a camera of his own,
finding that- no > ordinary . one would
achieve his object. Since then he has
been through a maze of bolts and
screws, shutters and lenses, and lias
made four cameras. .
THE SUNDAY CALL.
"It took nim three weeKs to maKc tlie
first one. and with it only two suc:ess
lul pictures were made, in size 7 by ;?o
inches. Finding these somewhat de
fective, .the camera was thrown aside
and a second and larger machine start
ed. This was torn to pieces at least
six times, but, after much ;vork, with it
was made the most artistic photograph
of the famous Pali, near Honolulu, ever
produced. Mrs. Vaniman.' with the eye
of an artist, has colored this picture,
making it" even more beautiful.
The camera used for these photo
graphs is almost as large as a small
trunk. At the time of makinsr the pic
ture of the Pali Captain Maj?ee of the
bark Battle Abbey, then at Honolulu,
expressed a desire to -accompany Mr.
Vaniman up the rugged cliffs. He had
climbed the Andes and Alps, but had
hcaVd from English travelers of the
Pali, and wanted to try it. - '
LARGEST PANORAMIC
TAKEN ON
He was a heavy man,' and the method
employed in ascending the Pali was not
calculated to reassure him. The side of
the cliff is covered with tangled vegeta
tion and shrubs. The climbers made
their toilsome way with a larjje iron
hook secured to the end of a rope. This
hook was thrown up as far as possible
to catch a hold among the moss and
shrtdps and the explorers would then
pull themselves up by the rope. This
process, oft repeated, brought them at
last to a ledge at an elevation of 500
feet. . â â¢
Here the picture was taken, after
some time spent in bringing around the
doughty captain, who nearly collapsed
from his exertions in breathing and
climbing.
Mr. Vaniman became known in Hon
olulu as the "'trapeze photographer,"
from the aerial methods to which he
was often obliged to resort in securing
his broadest picture effects. In taking a
picture of the beach at Waikiki he built
a three-cornered portable tower thirty
feet high, somewhat like a windmill.
This was placed in position amone
the incoming waves and helped in giv
ing the picture a depth not usually seen
in such views. This tower cost $$o and
only came into service on this one oc
casion. \
But the most thrilling and melodra
matic position into which, Mr. Vani
man's keen scent in the advancement 01
photography ever took him was when
he spent two and a half hours rocking
to and fro at the tnn of the tallest mastPHOTOGRAPHS EVER
ONE PLATE
of the bark Gerard C. Tobev. waiting
for the great masses of cloud to give the
sxra a chance, so that he might get the
birdseye view tor which he had risked
hi< life and his limbs.
He tells of his success in the follow
ing entertaining way: "Well. I am a
great "landlubber/ you know, and I
never was tooth of a climber. I never
thought of climbing a mast before in
sny life. But, I wanted that view and it
seemed to me that the masthead of that
ship was the only place from which to
get it. The captain offered- me any part
of the ship that 1 might want, but when
he found that 1 was going to climb the
mast he advised me not to do it. I tell
you there were a grinning lot of sailors
around when the procession of two
started up through the rigging.
"I took the big box camera, and there
was no grin on my face. 1 am sure. The
captain was half way up the rigging be
fore I got stsrtcd. When I reached
him lie took the camera from me.
"I hung on and got over the rim of
the foretop.. wishing I was anywhere
but where I was. I exemplified the
next dizzy climb. of over one hundred
feet to the royal yard at the top. I
didn't <!are look anywhere else. The
captain was sitting there unconcernedly
hvjrginsj the camera. lu a few moments
more the sailors below had hoisted the
yard to the eyes of the rigging, or mast-
Ijcadcdifci as they call it^ A lower point
would have been no good for the view.
r>n account of the intervening ropes.
Then the captain slid down again.'
"I was alone, and my hair w^.s stand
ing on end â of course from the wind!
I Ird'a wad of trood stout rope 'in my
pocket and I lashed myself to the mast.
THE * SUN DAY CALL.
a (hTi'cuft onc-lianaed sort of a fob. i
tied knots without number and the
wind whistled around me and threat
ened to throw me out into space. My
bead was whirling; from the d ; zzv
height, and my hat .was gone. The
pigmy-like figures of the sailors below
seemed as far off as though in Africa,
and the mast swayed back and^ forjh
with a qualmish motion that was awful!
"The big camera box bobbed about
like a spool and threatened to fall, into
the sea with - every pitch. The royal
yard wobbled fearfully beneath my feet,
and I had to do a sort of sailor's horn
pipe step with every lurch to keep mv
feet where they ought to be. I had a
great time getting the camera into po
sition. I supoorted it on a triangle
which I lashed to the mast. . â¢ â¢ â â :
"The wind blew the cap from the lens
and I had to use a piece of paper which
I found in my pocket. Finally when I
got it focused and all readv with the
sun shining j brightly, a great cloud
sailed over the city. It threw the wnore
view into, shadow, and, will you believe
it? I had to wait up there two hours and
a. half, with the wind blowing at thirty
five miles an ho'.ir. . before I got a
chance to press the lever and take the
picture. '
"To make sure. I went through the
process three times, though with the
greatest difficulty. It took one arm to
hold on to the mast, and the other to
take out the plate holders and replace
them. The swaying of the mast ren
dered it almost impossible to keep the
plate horizontal with the view and two
of the plates were spoiled 0:1 this ac
count. The third was a success.
''Good -luck. I guess, got me down
again safely} My nerves needed, and
.trot, about two days in bed afterward.
But I felt repaid with the results I got.
If you want to take pictures, go up a
ship's mast. You'll enjoy it."
Through a* hornets' nest with a cam
era was another of Mr. Vaniman's ex
\ â 
plorations in search of the picturesque.
He found it in large bunches.
He was on his way from Hilo to Wai
aluka to take a picture for the railwav
company, and with him was young Ad
dison Mizner of San Francisco. The
two were clambering up a side hill, car
rying the camera, as big as a trunk, be
tween them. The end of it struck what
looked like a big. mass of clav. but
which turned out to be a hornets' nest
in disguise. The air was filled with
many things in less than a second. A
flying camera, two flying men and hun
dreds of flying- hornets! The lid came
off the camera, the light got in it and
no picture was taken that day.
Mr. Vaniman. who starts on a tour of
the world shortly, has just received a
commission from General Warfield to
make a panoramic view from the sum
mit of Mount Tamalpais. Before his
return the world at large will have con
tributed many beautiful scenes to his
camera. ALFRED DEZENDORF.

THERE IS A SPLENDID COLLECTION OF THE FAMUUb mnoiLun oonuuuu. . Â«.â.-
ING RIGHT HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO. TH^SE ARE THE PAINTERS WHO CAME FROM THAT
LITTLE VILUGE NEAR THE FOREST OF FONTAINEBLEAU, SUCH MEN AS COROT, MILLET,
ROUSSEAU, JACQUE, ETC. POSSIBLY YOU KNOW THE POSSESSOR OF THESE WORKS OF
ART AND THE STORY OF HOW THEY CAME TO OUR CITYâ IF NOT, READ BELOW.

will appear at a later date yet to be

f>"t COLLECTION of the famous Bar-'
f\ blzon school of painting on this
Jâ I far end â¢ of the continent! Con-
V, I nolsaeurs may open their eyea.
JL artists pause to listen, - and the
patrons of art Jingle their gold and brisk
ly Inquire, "where/," and well they may,
for the statement is not a mere jumble of
words, "it really, means" something.;
It means that here in a private gallery
in San Francisco is one of;the irfost com
plete collections in "America of the orig
inal masters and. founders of the: famous
Barbizon school of painting. In the resi
dence of Colonel Trumbo. a well known
lover and patron of ' both local and for
eign painting, are gathered together can
vases representing, with . two exceptions
only each member of the original famous
school. ' â "
This school of Barbizon,. which- Is sit
uated in the little : village of the same
name in ; Paris, has had more or less In
fluence, on art the world over, and of all
the various schools this one has to-day
the most distinguished followers. For tha
greatest landscape painters the world has
ever known and recognized lived and died
in. this little world, near the forest, of
Fontalnebleau. ' . 'â  \. \
Few there are. in America,- or for that
matter abroad, who can boast a collec
tion of these original signatures, for they
are indeed rarities. In every gallery of
note there is at least one of the Barbizon
school,- but, as the years pass the diffi
culty to procure these increases: and now
to get a Rousseau, a ..Corot or a Millet
means not only enormous outlay of ready
cash, but genuine strategy to purchase it.
Strategy, because if bought in France the
sale must be closed in secrecy, for the
French Government, the highest author
ity on art known, recognizing the merit
of their .'countrymen's work, and con
tinually wishing to add to the gigantic
salon for which Paris is renowned, will
overbid any foreign purchaser, and, of
course, claim the painting.
Whenever the rumor is given out that
a house of nobles must dispose of its gal
lery to" readjust its financial condition,
which case â¢ in France is .not an Infre
quent one, the Government purchaser i3
always on hand. For several years past
a Rousseau, a .Corot, a Millet, Dupre,
Daubigny. Diaz. Jacque,, Gerome or a
Rosa Bonheur has not been allowed to go
out of France at all if the fact were
known. So- Colonel Trumbo is wise to
prize his collection, for it would be almost
an Impossibility to duplicate It.
One side of this gallery. is given entire
ly' to the Bartfizons. There is In all a
Rousseau, a Corot. a Millet, two by Jules
Dupre. one by Victor Dupre, a De Camp,
a Daubigny, a Diaz, a Van.Marcke, a
Jacquot. a Gerome and a Rosa .Bonheur.
The last two named are of the ljiter Bar
bizon school, the others of the ekrly.
SOt the first-named master, RousseaiV
there is. much to be said, for he was one
of the original settlers in Barbizon, and
his love .-.for nature and the marvelous
fidelity, with which he could impart" the.
.same to canvas won him the name which
â¢".will.- go down; in â¢, history. He was called
the "king of landscape painters," the
â Beethoven of, art. .the Shakespeare of the
.â¢â¢brush and many other appellations,' which
',^only ; partially convey the fact that., his
. handwas gifted with an execution . cer
..tainly marvelous. :â â -,- , , â .. ; . "
'.- Rousseau; painted., nature in all, her va
rietyâmountain : and... valley, gay ' and
â¢somber,' but always nature.. Perhaps, his
most ; prized -work â  and that, in which he
.has never: had a rival is the treatment of
; <the oaks.' The.. forest of Fontainebleau,
wiiich he loved as only a native of France
can love -her woods, was immortalized by
his brush, and to-day it -is known there,
"as Rousseau's Forest, and several par?
' ticularly. grand. old trees standing on the
ioutskirts; of the' village are pointed out
â¢ to curious tourists as the Rousseau oaks.
,But like all great souls who have helped
.to make the : world's history, - Rousseau
,. . had' his hardships and his struggles. Born
v " in 1812, he worked, studied and exhibited
his efforts only to 'be laughed at and ig
nored until the year-1855. : whenhe began
â¢ ' to ; receive faint commendation. Ten years
..later the world, began \to wake to his real
worth and to'pay the homage due a great
master, but he, did not t live : to enjoy ha
fame, for in 1867 he died, iâ¢â¢*" 1 " 1^*
upon his death his works became of peat
commercial value, and now owing to
their scarcity- as well as beaut}, are
greatly coveted. . â¢ 1Q â
Camllle Corot. who died in the year -IS, w.
was also another of the so-called P^asanc
painters, whose Intense love for na^
has made his name sacred in the wora
of art. The Corot landscape which han ? s
in this collection is one of a very few Hi
the United States. It is an idealization of
nature, a beautiful brown in tone, a . poe t
lcal bit of woodland, with here and theie
a delicate effect of light; every line . eie-y
sweep of the brush-clean and aaimj,
every touch of detail adding to a har
monious whole. This masterpiece- at
Corot is a painting which will day aftei
day, with sunshine or gloom, develop new
beauty. Enchanting as it is at first sight,
with long acquaintance it will be loved-
Another very beautiful picture is a large
canvas of a storm scene by Jules uÂ«P*e â â¢
Of this artist the authorities of the Fails
salon have said that he is. the only man
who ever succeeded in painting the. otner
side of a cloud. And his clouds are cer
tainly wonderful in this picture which
represents- an angry sky, grotesquely
formed masses :of clouds, spotted ana
fringed with flecks of transparent color
and this whirlwind of toned mist swerves
and moves as the current \ sweeps _it
down landward. In the foreground a few
trees stand en masse, tall and
watching as it were the. war of the ele
ments which threatens above.
A very noticeable thing about these pu.
tures of the Barbizon school is tteelr re
markably smooth finish. There is barely

Few places in the world are more closely
allied with genius than Barbizon. anl
few nainters are better known and loved
thete than was Jean Francois Millet, for
he was born and bred a peasant; he min
gled with and was to the last one of the
people. His brush: spoke nature In its
every interpretation and always with ab
solute truthfulness. Millet did not ideal
ize; he put all the matter of fact, all tin
prose . in every-day life in his work. Yet
every picture from his hand Is a master
piece.
As with his contemporary, Rousseau,
Millet had a cruel struggle for existence,
fields tor his daily brtad. and there where
he heloed to reap and gather the harvest
he made many l-Â£ the studies which now
stand as his most famous v.-orfc.
The most widely known of Millet's pic
tures is perhaps ihe "Angelas. " In Bar
bizon thi? beauciful cus-iom of observing
the Angelus baa not entirely passea.
Sometimes stilt, when the silver bell rin~>
out, 5 the field workers bow their heavlj
reverently, and the poor struggling peas
antry, who. after ail, may be happy in
their very ignorance of a. better condition,
offer up a prayer to their Creator. Coun
try of mingled poetry and prose, small
wonder It is that it is called the Mecca of
artists. Millet was not fully recognized
and appreciated until 1S71. /and fate left
him but few years in which to enjoy
his fame, for his death occurred In '75.
But In' the village of Barbizon his studio
Still stands, every detail of interior as he
left it. - The shurters are closed and the
blinds drawn, but any one desiring to ,
visit this sanctuao* of the great master,*
can, with a small fee to the attendant;!
C There Is his table, his bookshelves. hl3
easel, the palette brushes and a few
chairsi No luxury, no article that was
not in almost daily use: simplicity was
the keynote of Millef s life. Sometimes
the students of the present day Barbizon.
and there is a colony > there, steal away
from their companions and reverently
pass the door of this humble domicile.
They sit In his chair and wander about
the room, with a vague hope that through
some subtle Influence of the quiet studio
the mantle of its former occupant will
envelop them. But Barbizon has not yeÂ«
produced a second Millet. -
Visitors to France cannot say they havf
been in France at all If they skip Barbi
zon, for there Is the most famous wood
in the world, giant trees which for count
less ages have spread their sturdy arms
to the smiles and tears of the elements,
the forest of Fontalnebleau. This forest
which Is criss-crossed with paths and
roads, is also used as a preserve, and
there the nobility of France In gay hunt
ing parties add' a touch of romance as
they dash through the masses of follasa
in pursuit of game.
The other side of the life plcttrrÂ» dis
closes a peasant, as he stoops to gather
the fagots and twigs under tha branches
of the giant oaks, forln France nothing
goes to waste, each twig Is carefully ta
ken home and Is added to others of which
the queer brooms are made which ara
used by the peasants throughout FTan.ce,
The ground Is clean, for each dried
branch Is taken for firewood.
But Barbizon with these later years fsÂ»
being invaded by wealth and fashion, r
Young Mr. Artist who has a rich father l
studies in Barbizon, the grandes dames
of society take rest cures In Barbizon
and go home with trophies In the way of
sketches of the Rousseau oaks. Young
students who are geniuses, if geniuses
consists in the length of hair, wonderful
ly attired in vari-colored clothes, with a
valet to carry their painting parapher
nalia, sit about in the fields and alons
the byways to study the tollers, much to
the disgust of those whole-souled people.
Henry Breuer, one of our local art-
spent some time In Barblzon last
rear, and while there made many charm-,
ng studies of the famous forest. Alaal
:his illustration of the street of Bar-f
Mzon was painted while there. In the\
â niddle distance to the left is the studio
>f the immortal Millet. Mr. Breuer says
:hat now through the very center of this
Jtreet. which appears so beautiful In ita
simplicity and cleanliness, the poetry la
somewhat disturbed by a very up-to-date
md decidedly out of place little tram '
;ar, which dashes up the narrow avenue
>ast the studio, chug-chug, puff, and, with
frequent unmusical toots, stops in front
af the quaintly charming old hotel, ths
first building to the right In the picture.
Here the cars are unloaded of theii
aurden of tourists and do\frn street agair
sputters this evidence of modern progress,
whose Invasion the old artist residents
there regard as sacrilege.
At the far end of this street. Juttina
nut from the ylope of the mountain, is
i huge bowldjer. one sitle made smooth,
and It serves as a mount for the portraii
head of Millet, coupled v.ith that ol
Rousseau. A noble evidence of the ap
preciation to these giants of their' da}
and generation.

CT^ HE town or rotalurra is ruled by
I five hundred thousand hens. They

But for these half a million of hens
the town would cevcr have been v.'hat
it now is. r.r.d the eg-g and poultry rais
in j industry of Petaluma would never

wi\ In thr> r>iiÂ«'trv hi'v'rw^s 1r>. Ihic fnvnr-
ed spot, which many finally do. Twenty
three years ago . there were not more
than a hundred or two chickens to be
found In or around Petaluma. Now more
e-gs and poultry are shipped from that
ooint than from all the other towns of
the State combined, and the poultry
ranches vary In Â«i*e from a backyard to
a hundred acres or more. No person hav
Â«-ig a scrap of land to spare is without a
"Yrijck of hens.
/ The few figures following make the egg
-business appear a very much more dig
nified occupation than it is popularly sup
posed to bs"
The shipments from Petaluma last year
were '' 600,000 'dozen eggs. 30,000 dozen of
poultrj : . As h!gn a? 14.000 dozen eggs
have been shipped oit in one/day from
th* Petaluma market alone. More than
onv-half of the e%s and poultry used
Jn San Francisco yearly come from this
town of brooders and Incubators. For
the motherly hen -docs "ot belong' here
and it is as much as her life is worth to
show acy inclination to set.
PetaluVna's proud position as the egs
center of the Pacific Coast Is not the re
sult of accident, but is due to a combina
tion, viz.: right soil, cool summers and
favorable location. Nearness to the San
Franclcco market and the extremely low
freight rates afforded by reason of the
competition between water and rail
transportation are other important fac
tors In its development.
The poultry Industry has been the
means of making much otherwise worth
less land much more valuable. The big
Ootati Rancho of 10.003 acres has recently
Oa on subdivided and Eold out In small
ladings. To drive through it now is to
rind a veritable poultry city.
The white Leghorn fowls, among the
best layers known, are kept to nearly the
entir* exclusion of other breeds, for the
*SX business is really more promising
here than the poultry side of the indus
try. x
It is a pretty sight at the feeding time'
of 6000 or 70C0 hens on a many-acred
ranch. Perhaps the chicken houses, each
with its r.ear-by colony of 100 to 150
chickens, are scattered over many acres,
sometimes i^rnidst the green of. a foothill
orchard. â¢ :â¢â ..â¢â¢"â 
There is a rush and. flutter of v a living/
cloud of white 1 iis the man starts-^out'

of this trip' Varies/, of -course,' with: â¢ the
Bmount .of Jand. occupied*, .nut the^feedingi
sled sorretimes makes a circuit of a mile.
The hens are generally- fed only once a
day, with the addition of ?Â» lunch of greah
feed at night. The eled Is loaded with
four barrels of water, five sacks of wheat
and a mash composed of three /sacks of
coarse middlings and forty pounds of
either cut green bone or ground fresh
meat, which Is mixed with skim milk
that has been allowed to sour. On a big
ranch it takes from 6 a. m. until 11 o'clock
to complete the feeding: and watering, and
'a sufficient quantity is put out to last
twenty-four hours. Seventy-live hens ar*
roosted In' each house, and the houses are
built on runners.
The colonies are from 400 to 500 feet
apart and the hens being well supplied
with feed, are content and do not wander
from one colony to another.
An interesting feature of this open col
ony system is that each fowl knows and
goes to unerringly Its own , particular col
ony house, for roosting, at night.
No man is considered a professional
poultry reiser about Petaluma unless hÂ«
keeps at least a thousand hens. Anothef
way of keeping the fowls Is in 'a continc
uous row of houses with wire-inclosed
run-yards attached; but the scattered col
ony system seems to be the favorite, ariÂ£
is also .the more healthful and gives beC
results in fertility, and vigor. .._
Many of the women" of Petaluma are
kept busy feeding the chickens. In 1900
$20,000 was spent with the merchants of
the town for. chicken feed. This was out
side and above the feedstuff which some
of the larger poultry raisers Import from
San Francisco. Small oyster . shells are
bought in this town of hens by . the
schooner load to furnish the biddies with
the lime wherewith- to produce' a proper
eggshell. The cost of feeding one hen wei!,
ami strike. the happy medium of success
in feeding:, is about 65^ cents per. yearâ
THE SUNDAY CALL.
from that to $1. ' A" man will. go' into a
store in Petaluma and buy $500 worth. of
chicken feed and pay cash forit as read
ily and -perhaps more so than he would
buy.hls wife a silk sown.
Spot cash is the basis on which trading
â¢ is ; done in : Petaluma; = and . the hens have
made it so.* The local merchants pay out
to small producers on an average of $3000
per. day for eggs and poultry. -
Producers get cash almost dally for
their 'products and can. sell one . bird or
one dozen eggs to a lively lot of.competi
tors' for cash at i the same rate that a
.thousand, birds or a thousand dozen eggs
would be bought for. -
. The Petaluma poultryman sells his eggs,
he. don't consign them. In the spring sea
son- San Francisco and other dealers send
to the town, and their agents may be
often found out on the country roads.try
nlg to induce the incoming poultrymen
to sign contracts to sell their products to
them i for the entire year. Many small
producers ship eggs and poultry direct
to San Francisco hotels and restaurants.
Twenty to thirty coops of poultry are
shipped each day from Petaluma to the
San. Francisco market. Poultry and eggs
to the. value of $1500 are the daily ship
ments from the town at' present, which
figure is raised to $2500 from April to July.
Wells-Fargo shipped through their of
fice last year, from Petaluma 11,000 cases
of eggs and 6000 boxes of butter, and the
Petaluma Express Company is handling
more than 100 cases per day. . ;c -.j*
The best r argument as to profits Is the
fact that everybody in the town is in the
poultry; business in some form, and they
all stay, in it and enlarge each year.' The
average profit per hen Is $1 to $1 53 Ret
per annum. One man about three miles
from Petaluma has succeeded by special
care, neatness and good selection of fowls,
in making his hens pay a trifle over Â£2
each ' per annum.
If the eggshells were only as valuable
as the eggs what a duplicate store of
riches would accrue to many. The in
cubators leave behind them a vast num
ber of shells, which are carted away by
the wagon load for use- in the tanneries,
or are crushed and fed to their near rela
tives, the chicks. Perhaps the biggest
wagon load on record was made by the
shells left by 45,000 chicks hatched by in
cubator. Encased in wire netting they re
sembled a case of huge popcorn.
The average poultry ranch is of about
ten acres, on which can be kept 1500 hens,
with plenty of room for a horse and to
raise kale and cabbage for dry season
food for the chickens, and plenty of bar
ley.
One of the biggest income producers
near Petaluma is the Freeman ranch at
Fallon, with 7000 hens, bringing in $30 per
day.. The Strantz brothers, known' as the
most progressive paultrymen, having the
prettiest ranch in the surrounding coun
try; with over 1500 thoroughbred white
Leghorns, make $20 net per day. The
Purvine brothers have among them the
largest poultry interests of the county,
perhaps, there being seven or eight of the
brothers, each having a ranch with from
S000 to 6000 hens. The farm of W. Purvine
contains 313 acres. A few people go in
for fancy breeds, but there is practically
no one engaged in raising table fowl to
any extent. H. R. Campbell makes a spe
cialty of barred Plymouth Rocks and ha3
come of the finest in Sonoma County.
Many 'poultrymen make a -specialty of
hatching by the thousand, to sell to.
others to keep up their,- flocks. In 1880
much wheat was shipped from Petaluma;
now twice the quantity â¢ is shipped into
the town to be sold for chicken feed. TeÂ»
years ago anything could be sold for
feed; now the demand Is for choice mill
ing wheat. The dealers buy in immenso
quantities" and can sell law.
It may be said that the Petaluma hen
practically lays .'her egg on. Front street.
San Francisco. â¢ â¢
By- the steamer Gold cases of eggs are
delivered in San Francisco every day to
dealers and the empty cases returned to
Petaluma for 20 cents per case. This, is
less than the cartage would be from the
ferry to the buyer in San Francisco. Tha
dealers'; aim is to make one-half to one
cent per dozen on eggs"shipped. The pro
ducer gets the balance. Eggs marked
"Petaluma" . readily bring five cents per
dozen - more than those, from other
sections. Petaluma eggs keep bet
ter than â¢ others in cold.- storage,
and - the big plant run ; there by
Dodge, Sweeney & Co. Is no small help to
the poultryman. The â  company . is now
shipping seventy-five or eighty cases per
day. and last year in competition shut out
17,000 cases of Eastern storage eggs from
the San Francisco market. The storage
room, of this. company In Petaluma will
accommodate . 10,000 cases of eggs.
Though many broilers are marketed In
San Francisco every year from Petaluma.
yet- 247 carloads of poultry came
into the San Francisco market from
the East last year, with â¢ from.
6000 to 6000 fowls In a car. which,
would suggest that some one might
make a< 'profitable specialty of ta
ble fowl raising in this town of Sonoma
County. When San Francisco needs a big
order,- of: eggs and poultry at once for
shipment to * Honolulu or for any other
purpose Petaluma is drawn upon at ad
vanced prices.
The difference in the cost of transporta
tion and the certainty of best values in
Petaluma' as compared to other more
remote,' or not so naturally favored local
ities, amounts to the saving of an enor
mous tax. Figure It on a medium sized
ranch, one 'that sells six cases of eggs
per week and saves say 'ten cents per
case on his freight and gets one cent per
dozen more lor eggs than is paid for the
product of other sections for a run of
say ten years.
One half a" million of hens within a ra
case on freizht and gets one cent per
ter fed and give the egg collector a
chance oftener than in any other known
spot. Truly, Feialuma and vicinity must'
be the ideal hennery of the world.

Specie! Dispatch to The Call.
' CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
'TT, WASHINGTON, Dec 7.â President
Roosevelt's remarks on the Monroe doc
trine In his nessage to Congress are re
garded here as an announcement that the
Monroe doctrine will hereafter be Inter
preted as discouraging and disfavoring
territorial aggrandizement by one repub
lic at the expense of another.
This Interpretation has aroused much
Interest among public men and diplomats,
and efforts have been made to ascertain
just what the President did mean by l^s
declaration.
"It is not." said a Cabinet officer, "a
declaration on the part of the President
that the United States will not permit any
aggression by any one American, power
upon territory of another. It Is" a declara
tion that this Government would regard
with great concern and great disfavor any
conquest cf an American power by an
cther American power. It does not mean
that the United States will form an alli
ance with a weaker power to prevent its
conquest with a stronger one."
Senator Lodge, a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who lis
tened to the statement, approved the in
terpretation given, adding, "The declara
tion simply repeats the traditional , and
uniform 'policy of this country. It Is nof
a new departure."
3oosevelt's Interpretation Hew.
Nevertheless, an examinaion of former
Presidents' messages shows no such in
terpretation as given by President Roose
velt. These positions have been hitherto
taken with respect to the Monroe doc
trine:
The declarations upon which Monroe
consulted Jefferson and his Cabinet relat
ed to the interposition of European pow
ers in affairs of American states.
The kind of interposition declared
against was that which may be made for
the purpose of controlling their political
affairs or cf extending to this hemisphere
the system In operation upon the conti
nent of Europe by which great powers
CSerclse control over the affairs of other
European states.
The declarations do not Intimate any
course of conduct to be pursued in case
cf such interposition, but merely say they
/ Tould be considered as dangerous to our
peace and safety, and as "manifestation
of an unfriendly disposition toward the
United States," which it would be im
possible for us to "behold with indiffer
ence," thus leaving the nation to act at
all times as Its opinion of Its policy or
duty might require.
The United States has never made any
alliance with or pledge to any other
American state en the subject corered by
the declarations.
No Prohibition by Monroe.
Declaration respecting non-colonization
was a subject distinct from European In
tervention with American states and re
lated to the acquisition of sovereign title
by any European power by new and orig
inal occupation or colonization. The
principle of public law upon which It was
placed was that the continent must be
considered as already within the occu
pation and jurisdiction of an Independent
civilized nation.
There Is nothing In the message of
President Monroe which refers in any
way to the relations of Spanish-American
states or the Imposition or any prohibi-
tion upon them to extend their respective
territories. President Monroe asserted
ltfat."it is stiil the true policy of the
Ty:ited States to leave the parties (Spain
and the South American States) to them
selves, In the hope that other powers will
pursue the same course."
President Grant, in his second annual
message, paved the way for President
Roosevelt's utterance by declaring that
"allied and other republics of Spanish
origin on this continent may see In this
fact a new proof of our sincere Interest
In their welfare, of our desire , to see
them blessed with good governments cap
able of maintaining order and of preserv
ing their respective territorial Integrity."
Little Bepublics Protest.
In Pan-American diplomatic circles
great importance Is attached to Roose
velt's declaration. One diplomat stated
that it meant nothing less than an" an
nouncement cf the purpose of the Wash
ington Government to direct the foreign
policies of the American republics.
"The Monroe doctrine," he said, "de
fined foreign policies of American repub
ycÂ» crlth respect to Europe. The doctrine
pTSLauIgated by Roosevelt tells us that
we will not be allowed to take the fruits
of war provided they be in the shape of
territory. If Brazil and Argentina were
to become involved in a war under Roose
velt's policy the conqueror would'not be

REAR ADMIRAL SAMPSON

While There Has Been No Marked Change

ONE OF THE PRINCIPALS IN A CELEBRATED NAVAL CONTRO
VERSY WHOSE FAILING HEALTH. CONTINUES TO CAUSE GREAT
CONCERN AMONG HIS RELATIVES AND FRIENDS
WSHINGTON, Dec' 7.â It is
authoritatively stated that
there has been no marked
change for the worse In the
condition of Rear Admiral
'allowed to permanently occupy territory
of the conauered.
"In the case of Chile this is particularly
unjust. She is progressive and Industri
ous. Her country Is now too small for
her population and expansion Is necessary â¢
if she Is to become a great power. Presi
dent Roosevelt, however, steps in and
says she cannot acquire additional ter
ritory. Does his doctrine apply to the
Tacna-Arlca dispute? Is Chile to be com
pelled to surrender provinces which she
has held as compensation for her ex
penses during the war with Peru?
Permanence of Small Nations.
"Carrying out the policy of Roosevelt,
in case Costa Rica and Colombia become
Involved in war, an appeal from Costa
Rica will result in the Interference of
thÂ« United States, because of Roosevelt's
purpose to secure the permanence of the
lesser among the new world of nations."
Senor Silva, the Colombian Minister,
said Roosevelt's declaration was certain
ly a new Interpretation of the Monroe
doctrine. "The Idea Roosevelt probably
had In mind," he continued, "was to dis
arm the suspicion unhappily harbored by
some South Americans that the United
States still contemplates expansion at the
expense of South American republics. He
undoubtedly designed to tighten the bonds
existing between Pan-American nations,
and to this end he gave utterance to
statements certain to inspire confidence
and trust in the country which has al
ways been our friend. Roosevelt's decla
ration is new, and it Is important, but I
am unable to state what Its effect will
be."

to-day by traffic officials of the Texas

that the xeraarkable decline in Mexican

Body.

Charles Allen Tinder Arrest for the
Murder of Joseph Griffith, Who
Disappeared in April
of This Year.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 7.â Joseph Grif
fith, the Grass Valley citizen who disap
peared from his home on April 15 of this
year and was not heard from again there
after, was murdered, 'tils bodj^ was
found to-day at the bottom of an aban
doned mine shaft, where it had lain dur
ing all the months while the relatives of
the missing man were prosecuting an ex
haustive search for trace of him. To
night Charles Allen is in the custody of
the Sheriff, charged with the crime. It
was through a relative of his that the
body of the murdered man was recov
ered, its hiding place being revealed upon
the payment of a stated sum by the
widow.
This sordid desire for money may result
in the hanging of Griffith's slayer. Al
len's relative had asked what he might
expect if he showed the exact spot where
the body lay. He was offered $100, but
this was not enough. He demanded $200,
with $50 for the woman who gave him his
information. After consultation with the
widow of Griffith it was decided to pay
the man the sum he asked and all ar
rangements were made for the transfer
of the money upon the finding of the
body. " . > '.'â " ? ;â .'â¢ .â  â¢,.â¢;â  !
Following the receipt of the money he
demanded the relative of Allen gave di
rections as to how the -body could be
found. The descent into the shaft was
made by William . Curry and John Hock
ing, who found the remains. The body
was covered with brush, tin- cans and
other refuse matt***- The head had been
severed. The body was fully clothed and
the clothing and shoes were recognized
by the relatives. The shaft was fifty feet
deep.
ylt was In Charles Allen's house that
Griffiths was last seen alive, and Mrs.
Allen's stories in relation to his visit
have been conflicting. To the members
of the missing man's family she said that
she had last seen Griffiths at' 7 o'clock on
the morning of April 15, while to Sheriff
Getcheil she said she had seen him at 4
o'clock that afternoon. Although . this
variation caused comment at the time, It
was not deemed of sufficient Importance
to connect the woman or her husband
with the disappearance. - ,
The secret of the crime came to light
through the women of the neighborhood
discussing it among themselves. At the
outset knowledge of the tragedy. was con
fined to two or three persons. One woman
confided in a friend, and in this manner
the facts came to the ears of Marshal
Deeble and John Hocking. Having as
their clew only a word dropped in an un
guarded moment they eventually came
to believe that Charles Allen had some
connection with the crime, and it was

HAY FLATLY REFUSES
TO DIVULGE SECRETS
OF STATE DEPARTMENT
Fruitless Attempt Is Made to Compel the
Secretary to Give Testimony in a
New York Libel Suit.
MEMBER OF THE CABINET WHO REFUSES TO BE BLUFFED BY AT
TORNEYS IN A LIBEL SUIT AND MAY ' BE CITED BY A NEW
YORK* JUDGE FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT.
_ __ -WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â There
>\y\ / was an interesting; and un-
VLf yy usual proceeding to-day
Â» Â» the State Department, when
attorneys representing parties
to a New York lawsuit sought to compel
the testimony of Secretary Hay. The case
was an action for libel brought against a
New York newspaper by Carl Fischer
Hansen, a Danish banker; resident In New
York, and in it Is Involved Captain Dirk-
felt Christmas. These persons were said
to be interested as agents in the attempt
to sell the Danish West Indian islands to
the United Government, and the
publication which forms the basis for the
libel suit Is said to have, reflected oh their
competency. . .
, No Personal Knowledge.
Some days ago Secretary Hay had notlco
that his testimony had been called for
by the defense before the United States
Court in New York, and to-day Clarence
J. Hearn, counsel for the newspaper in
question, appeared at the State Depart
ment with United States Commissioner
Frank Blackistone of this, city, and a
stenographer. Robert Honey of New
York appeared as counsel ; for Hansen.
The parties were : received .by Secretary.
Hay in the diplomatic room, the Secretary
being accompanied by Judge j Penflcld,
solicitor for the State Department, as his
counsel. . /
The examination did not last long; in
fact, there was no examination In sub
stance. The counsel for the newspaper
attempted to propound some "questions
touching the 4 negotiations that occurred
between Secretary Hay and the Danish
agents In 1899-1900/ The Secretary flatly
refused to answer these and through
Judge Penneld announced his reasons for
doing soâ that he had no personal knowl
edge of the . matters at issue. â¢â  Whatever
knowledge j he possessed had been ac
quired in his capacity of Secretary of
State, and' not â  as an' individual. More
over, the information sought to be elicit
ed was a privileged communication to the
Government of , the United States and to
make this public would be highly preju
dlclal^to the Interests of the country. .
â May Be 1 Cited for Contempt..
Having formally noted the Secretary's
refusal and the character of his answer,
the Commissioner and counsel withdrew.
It is their purpose to state the facts to
the New York court, with a view to_hav
ing the Secretary of State brought before
that court on a charge of contempt.
It appears that the same parties have
examined or- sought to examine Senator
Lodge and Admiral Bradford, chief of the
Equipment Bureau of the Navy Depart
ment, who has had much to do with the
negotiations looking to' the acquisition of
coaling stations by the United States
Government.
It Is gathered that neither of these wit
nesses gave *â¢ any j testimony material to
the suit, Senator Lodge, It is said, never
having, heard of Hansen, and Admiral
Bradford being acquainted with none of
the facts sought to be developed by the
defense as bearing upon the alleged libel.
Secretary Hay had had very little to
Jo wit^ the parties in this case. He saw
Captain Christmas for about five minutes
on the occasion, of the officer's visit to
Washington,- but Hansen he â  does not
know. The officials of the State Depart
ment feel secure in their position in re
sistance " to the court's order, finding
strong precedent for It in a controversy
that "arose . between President Jefferson
and 'Chief Justice Marshall over a similar
application for a mandamus. 'â¢

Surveying Party Already in the Field
to Establish Lines for the
Transmission <A*
Power.
The recently incorporated California Gaa
and Electric Company, with its capitaliza
tion of $30,000,000, is well on the way to
ward the consummation of a deal that
means the speedy development of Marln
County as a suburban residence section
and probably its ultimate connection with
the counties to the north and east DV a
network of electric railroads. The young
giant of California corporations will ab
sorb the North Pacific Coast Railroad,
commonly known as the "narrow gauge
road," and will at once convert it into an
electric road. Fast ferry-boat service will
be supplied, and the residents of San Ra
fael, Ross Station, Mill Valley and other
favorite town in California's "Switzer
land" will be given up-to-date rapid tran
sit, with electric cars or trains of cars
running as close together as the patron
age will Justify.
Papers will be filed within a few days
that will insure the control of the rail
road by the Interests dominant in the
new electric light and power corporation.
Already a surveying party is in the field,
having started from San Rafael, to es
tablish the most practicable lines for tha
transmission of power from the Yuba and
other sources controled formerly by the
Bay Counties Power Company and the
California Central Gas and Electric Com
pany, now merged Into one and strength
ened by the union of Eastern with Cali
fornia capital.
Electricity to Be Motive Power.
The entire railroad, from Sausalito to
San Rafael and San Quentln, from tha
junction to Mill Valley, and from San
Anselmo northward some eighty miles to
Cazadero, will be converted Into an elec
tric railway. First attention, of course,
will be directed to giving the section pop
ulated by San Franciscans, who have
built country homes among the redwoods
of Marin, the best possible service, with
fast boats making numerous trips and
comfortable ' electric cars or trains run
ning at short intervals and carrying the
commuters to and from their homes with
out the vexatious delays and discomforts
and great waste of time that have oper
ated to check the development of & re
gion fitted by nature to be the Ideal of
suburban residence districts.
Sausalito, Corte Madera, Ross station.
Mill Valley, San Rafaelâ all these and
others have climate and natural beauty.
Beautiful country homes have been built
on oak-studded hillsides and In shady,
canyons. Farther up the railroad are
dozens of popular summer resorts. To
allâ the residence towns and resortsâthe
conversion of tha antiquated narrow
gauge road into a modern electric railway
means a new era. And by San Francis
cans who have homes In Marln tha news
of the prospective change will be re
ceived Joyfully.
Extension to Petaluma.
The first extension of tributary lines,
reaching Into the territory In which tha
new corporation controls the power and
lighting systems, -will be from San Rafael
to Petaluma. It 13 understood that one
of the duties of the surveying party now
in the field is to make a preliminary sur
vey for such a line.
Some of the leading men among the
California stockholders of the new Cali
fornia Gas and Electric Company are
among the heavy stockholders of the
North Pacific Coast Railroad. J. C. Cole
man Is a director, and one of the large
stockholders of the railroad, and he has
already subscribed $30,000 in the stock of
the new corporation.
The p^clse nature of the deal Is still
kept secret between the two corporations.
It is believed, however, that enough pur
chases of stock have been made, together
with the affiliation of certain stockhold
ers of the railroad with the new corpora
tion, to give the gas and electric company
interests complete control. A change in
management will be involved and the
smaller stockholders who recently ; tried
to oust J. B. Stetson from his position of
president and general manager will now
doubtless have their wishes gratified. The
reorganized road will of necessity be
placed under the management of a man
familiar with the operations of electric
railroads.
The Nor^h Pacific Coast Railroad is
owned practically by ten stockholders,
four of whom have the large part of the
15,000. shares of the corporation's stock.
These are J. B. Stetson. Antoine Borel,
John C. Coleman and the Parrott estate.

son management and his encouragement

that a case not entirely cured within two

cure varlcocele in one week at our office, or
four weeks of home treatment. We have cured
over 8000 cases without a eingrle failure or un-

English Editor Advises

Bitter Article Against the

LONDON,' Dec. 7.â In an intensely bit
ter anti-American article,, the Saturday
Review to-day advocates German-Eng
lish friendship for the purpose of holding
the United States In check. Emperor
William, it declares, sees in the growing
German population of Chile and Brazil
the inevitable necessity for future inter
ference, which, "In any form, involves a
conflict with the United States."
This, the Saturday Review holds, It Is
impossible for Germany to wage success
fully if Great Britain is hostile. "While
not advocating an alliance with Germany
against the United States," the Review
says, "we advocate still less one with the
United States against Germany. But in
the event of a conflict we might, with ad
vantage to ourselves, hold the balance."
The Saturday Review stigmatizes Ger
many's rewarding Nicaragua and other
matters as fatuous, ridiculous and unpop

BY. CABLE TO THE CALL.
GERMANS WILL
FIGHT TARIFF
Opposition Leaders Plan
to Del ay Action on
a. Bill.
Russia and Austria May Suffer
From Proposed Leg-
islation.
BERLIN, Dec. 7.â The tariff bill goes
to the committee next week and nobody
expects its reappearance for months.
Bebel and Richter and other opposition
leaders have agreed to delay the measure
as long as possible in committee. They
are determined to make a light on every
one of the items. This well worn form
of preliminary action is to be continued
in the House after it leaves the commit
tee, and it is Â«f*rtte' possible that the final
vote will not be read until 1903, unless the
Government offers a. compromise, which
is unlikely. The Government, being aware
of the dilatory tactics ahead, is consider
ing changing the rules of the House so
as to block the obstructive work of the
opposition.
A variety of estimates of the majority
for or against the bill are being consid
ered. The general impression is that the
Government commands a large majority.
It is not the United States that would be
concerned should the tariff bill be put
through in its present form, but Russia
and Austria-Hungary. It is the belief of
the Foreign Office that Germany is well
able to uphold her side should the United
states make reprisals.
Russia and Austria -Hungary have al
ready informed Germany that they are
not willing to negotiate commercial
treaties on the basis of the pending tariff.
These notifications are considered equiva
lent to the declaration of an economic
war, in which the broad markets now
open to Germany will . immediately be
closed and the considerable volume of
United States products now finding its
way to Russia through German traders
would in consequence be excluded with
German goods.
The manager of the American Tool
Company's works in Berlin has made a
remarkable comparison of the wages paid
and the cost of tools made here with the.
wages paid and the cost of tools at the
American works, both sets of laborers
using identical machines. He finds that
the American workman, making an exact
allowance for the difference in wages,
turns out a clear 25 per cent more of
product for the same unit of wages. Man
for man, the German produces two-fifths
of what an American does. A shoe fac
tory at Breslau, using American machin
ery, secured better results by importing
eight American workmen and ! paying
them by the piece. Â»
The debate on- the tariff bill 'was re
sumed in the Reichstag to-day. Baron
von Wangenheim, Conservative, declared
that the proposals of Count von Kanitz,
the Agrarian leader, were the only ones
which would give relief, and that sooner
or later- recourse would have to be had
to them. The speaker added that if in
creased protection was rejected the Con
servatives would not vote for the bill.

PRINCE AS OBATOR
PLEASES THE BRITISH
Utterances of the Son of Edward
Raise Him in Public Es
timation.
LONDON, Dec. 7.â The evolution of the
Prince of Wales from a sailor Into an
orator causes more comment and satis
faction than any event of the week. His
Guildhall speech was perfectly free from
that platitudinous element usually no
ticeable in royal utterances in England.
His declaration that the old country must
wake up if it wants to hold its own al
most took his hearers' breath away, but
it has produced in all sections of the press
praise quite untainted by servility.
It is probable that the Prince was 1 not
entirely responsible for the construction
of the speech, as he used copious notes,
let his delivery, earnestness and willing
ness to commit himself to such senti
ments have raised him higher In the esti
mation of the people than any previous
action. Indeed, several of the papers de
clared that the elocution of Lord Salis
bury, Lord Rosebery and Chamberlain
fell quite flat after the Prince of Wales'
effort.
_â¢- Unquestionably the best speech deliv
ered at the breakfast," is the Spectator's
comment. The Saturday Review says:
He used his opportunity by saying things
of distinct political import, conventional
propriety being none me less punctilious
ly saved."
BRITONS FEAR FALL. .
OF THE IRON INDUSTRY
Statist Advises the Importation cf
Ore From Newfoundland and
Nova Scotia.
LONDON, Dec. 7.â Under the caption,
"Crisis in the British Iron Industry," the
Statist to-day, after expiating upon the
enormous developments in this line in the
United States to the detriment of Great
Britain, earnestly advocates the import
ing of ore from Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia and the establishment in England
of basic furnaces, by which alone that
ore can be treated.
"The revolution in the British lndustrv
must begin with the construction of basic
furnaces for the utilization of phosphoric
ores,", the paper adds, "which soon will
be all that is available. But that will not
suffice to preserve our steel making In
dustry. We must, also merge our smelt
ing^ and steel making in one continuous,
economical process."
In corroboration of the Statist's re
marks, it is said to-day that in the
Scotch steel trade many works will're
main closed throughout January, owing
to the uncombatlble competition of Amer
ica and the Continent and tne dearth of
fresh orders.
CORRESPONDENTS HAVE
PUN WITH STATESMEN
Members of the Famous Gridiron Club
Give a Notable December %
Dinner.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.-The Gridiron
Club, composed of forty Washington cor
respondents, scored another notable suc
cess to-night on the occasion of the De
cember dinner. About 150 guests assem
bled around the Gridiron table- at the Ar
lington Hotel. The features, as usual,
touched upon public events in a jocular
manner, and began with a menu which
was "A New Alice in Wonderland."; By
the most delicate inference the illustra
tions and quotations could be applied to
some of the events in the life of President
-Roosevelt. The arrival of the collier Mer
riment (Merrlmac) with a supply of cham
pagne to fill the bunkers of the diners was
a laughable skit, and the selection of : a
delegate to London to attend the corona
tion furnished opportunity for the nomi
nation of a number .of delegates for the
place and their rejection for various rea
sons.
Another laughable skit was a fake.meet
ing of an alleged cabinet, in which vari
ous characters appeared and tried to pass
themselves off as the real thing. They
were finally hustled out unceremoniously.
Among those who made excellent speeches

GET'S MURDERER
STILL AT LARGE
Brutal Chinese Assassin
Succeeds in Covering
His Tracks.
After a thorough investlgatoln the po
lice are satisfied that the three Chinamen
who were arrested in connection with the
murder of Wong Get, who was foully
slain ' on Commercial street , Friday
afternoon, had nothing to do with the
killing. The prlsoners.will.be given their
freedom to-day. The murderer, accord
ing to the police, is Quan Ho, a notorious
gun-fighter, who hails from San Jose. It
is known that he arrived here last Thurs
day, presumably in answer to a sum
mons from the BIng Kong Tong, the
most powerful organization in China
town.
Get, it was supposed, held the secrets
of a rival tong. and it was decided to put
him out of tne way. According 1 to the
ponce, Quan Ho was specially imported
trom San Jose to carry out tne eaict of
the Bing Kong Tong. While walking
along Commercial street, near Kearny,
Friday afternoon Get, who had arrived
in this city only a few days before, was
shot in i the back, dying in a short time
from, his wounds.
The murder was witnessed by Jack
Kelly, better known as Manila Jack, who
conaucts a saloon contiguous to the scene
of the shooting. After the murderer had
emptied his gun at his victim Kelly
chased him 'tor two blocks, but finally
lost him in - Fish alley. He is satisfied
that he will be able to Identify him in
case he is arersted. In his flight the
murderer dropped the revolver which he
used in dispatching his victim.
Last night Detectives George McMa
hon and" Kd Gibson were scouring China
town for the murderer. They seem, to
think he is in hiding in some den In the
Chinese quarter, awaiting a favorable op
portunity to leave the city. It is expect
ed that the Chinese Six Companies will
to-day offer a reward for the apprehen
sion of the murderer.

mittee. â '.
Dr. Russell H. Coll Entertains.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â By means
of an armored car Captain Thomas
Perry, senior officer in command of the
American naval forces j at Panama, main
tained free communication across the
isthmus. Secretary Long received to-day
two mail reports from Captain Perry re
garding the action he took to keep transit
open between Colon and Panama. Cap
tain Perry states that the interruption of
transit occurred on November. 24. He
continues:
"I decided to send an armed force of
150 out by the 8 o'clock train next morning
(this Monday morning) to clear tne line,
so an armored car was prepared during
the night and manned with a part of a
company and two Colt guns. This went
ahead of the engine flying the United
States flag. The remainder of the de
tachment was in the cars with orders to
permit no armed persons to enter, and
under command of Lieutenant Command
er G. H. Peters, U. S. N., who is com
manding the force on shore. I accom
panied the train. By the time we reached
Colon it was completely understood from
one end of the line to the other that in
future and while this disturbance con
tinues trains would be guarded by the
United States forces and under the
United States flag. On the way back to
Colon the greatest respect was shown,
and no objectionable act was committed
by either Conservative or Liberal sol
diers."
Cnptaln Perry's cable reports show that
the situation on the isthmus is quiet and
that the Government is able to maintain
free communication.

ference at Bocas del Toro between tne
foreign consuls, Captain Galloway, com
mander of the Tribune, and General Al
ban. . The latter declares that all the
Jamaicans imprisoned at Bocas del Toro
when the Government forces drove the
Liberals from the old bank were found in
arms against the Government. All of
.them had since been released.
A Colombian soldier who bayoneted a
steward of the Tribune at Bocas del Toro
was brought to Colon and will be im
prisoned at Panama, for thirty days.
Many British claims for damages sus
tained at Bocas del Toro and elsewhere
are being presented to the Government.
â¢ General Alban received the following
telegram yesterday from the capital of
the republic: .
"The country, proclaims you the savior
of the republic by virtue of your recent
triumphs and applauds you for your in
comparable energy, which is - always
greatest In times of national danger.
Alban Blames Railroad.
Senor Del Rio, the acting agent of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company at Pan
ama, who has been accused of complicity
in the doings of the Liberals and who was
given the option of standing trial or pay-
Ing $1000 and leaving the country In fifteen
days, has accepted the latter alternative
and will sail to-morrow for Chile.
General Alban says that all diplomatic
relations between Venezuela and Colom
bia have been severed. Venezuela, he
says, has 10,000 men In the Tachira dis
trict under General Gonzalo Valencia. Co
lombia has a much smaller force at
San Cristobal, under General Castro.
General Alban lays all the blame for
the recent isthmian events on the Pan
ama Railroad. He says it was criminal
to bring the enemy from Las Cascades
station to the gates of Colon, allowing
the Liberal soldiers to subseauently pay
the , fares for the Journey. The general
has formally protested against this ac
tion and a lawsuit will follow. He fur
ther declares that the railroad's subse
quent refusal to convey Government
troops along the line to the scene of the
engagements greatly Intensifies the of
fetise committed.
General Alban says that the Interior of
Colombia is all but quiet and that the
prospects of peace throughout the repub
lic are now very bright.
COURT SENDS
HER TO JAIL
Mrs. .Smith Refuses to
Tell Where Bonds
Are Located.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Dec. 7.â Because
she persistently refused to reveal the de
pository of 5300.000 In Government bonds
after being warned that her conduct con
stituted contempt of court and that the
only punishment provided by the 6tatutes
Is confinement in jail, Mrs. Mary E.
Wright Smith again defied Judge How
ard J. Curtis, in the Common Pleas Court
to-day and was committed to the County
Jail for an Indefinite period.
Mrs. Smith admitted to the court again
to-day that she had $300,000 in Govern
ment bonds, but she. said she will never
tell where they are deposited. She has
other interests which raise the value of
her fortune to more than $500,000. 8he Is
a business woman of the modern type
and has repeatedly spurned the advice of
her friends in her present predicament.
In business and social circles Mrs. Smith
stands high.
Orrin F. Dailey, a new York hat manu
facturer, brought suit against Mrs. Smith
to recover 5300 for office rent, contracted
Borne years ago when Mrs. Smith con
ducted a hat leather business in New
York City. During the trial of the case
she had as counsel " two women lawyers.
She declared, after the case was decided
against her that she would never pay the
judgment, which amounted to $300 with
costs. As she failed to liquidate the
judgment and no attachable property
could be found she was brought into
court on November 24 to reveal the
whereabouts of her bonds. She stub
bornly refused to answer the questions
put to her by the counsel and court.

FRENCH COMMERCIAL STUDENTS
MAY COME TO THIS COUNTRY
Official Who Will Investigate American Trusts to
Aid an Industrial College Project.
PARIS, Dec. 7.â LazarÂ« Welllers, Coun
cilor of Foreign Commerce, who with
Maurice de la Goutelllere. an engineer,
was Intrusted by the Government with
the task of making a special investigation
of American trusts, said to-day that he
will also make Inquiries In aid of the
Government's plan of organizing an In
dustrial college. He is a strong supporter
of the project and of the fostering of
closer commercial relations between the
two countries.
Weillers considered Plttsburg the best
center for the establishment of such an
Institution and he Intends to make an in
vestigation there, but Chicago and Phila
delphia are still being considered. The
Government has examined the suggestion
to send commercial students also, but will
wait until the industrial experiment shall
have been tried.
WeHlers' inquiry in the matter of the
trusts will occupy about four montEs,
during which time he will visit all the
Jndustrlal centers of the United States.
As the head of an electrical business he
already has relations with all the metal
lurgical concerns.
The Government is anxious to have a
competent opinion upon the effects' of the
formation of big trusts, and to what ex
tent they count in the Industrial progress
of the United States. This matter is of
peculiar interest to France, which is the
only European country enforcing the law,
dating back to the revolution, absolutely
prohibiting any form of trust. "\VeUlers
concluded:
"The results of my inquiry into the in
dustrial situation will enable the Govern
ment to Judge whether it will be the bet
ter policy for France to seek to work
hand and hand with the United States In
BOYS ORGANIZE
CRIMINAL CLUB
San Jose Police Uncover
] Band of Youthful .
[ Marauders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 7.â The police have un
earthed a Juvenile criminal club in this
city, which has been committing numer
ous depredations. In It are a dozen or
more boys and young men who have
gained notoriety in police circles because
or petty thefts. They have a thorough
organization, known as the Davy Crock
ett Club, with headquarters and a full
set of officers. So perfectly have they
organized that it is believed by the police
that some Fagln in the form of an ex
convict has been coaching the boys.
The disclosure was made by Peter Gar
cia, who was recently arrested for steal-
Ing a number of tools from John Leffler,
a livery stable keeper at the corner of
First and William streets.. Of late the
many small thefts have puzzled the po
lice. Garcia claims to have been refused
membership until he had gained a police
record, and In order to qualify he began
stealing.- Upon his arrest for purloining
the tools -Garcia pleaded guilty and re
ceived a sentence of sixty days in the
County Jail.
The boys disposed of tnelr goods
through a' local "fence" and In San Fran
cisco. A part of nil the proceeds went
into the club treasury. The police expect
to round up all the members of the club.

"Russia, from an army standpoint,
takes an intense interest in China." said
he. "In every part of the empire the
Czar is well represented by arms. This
naturally would be expected in Manchu
ria, but on the smallest pretenses Rus
sia has located company after company of
soldiers everywhere. While no one except
high army officials of Russia know any
where near the exact number, it is esti
mated that Russia has an aggregate force
of 200,000 soldiers in China. This is the
popular estimate, but it is probably too
conservative. The Czar's representatives
execute their movements in a manner
that attracts the least possible notice. In
this way thousands of soldiers have been
quietly added to the encamped forces."

and kindly nature. Captain Jacques takes
a quite different view. He claims that
there were more acts of depredation and
cruelty by Russians than. by any other
soldiers in Peking. â 
"Continually reports were brought to
me by my men," said he, "dealing with
misdeeds of Russian soldiers. They were
charged with many murders of innocent
and defenseless.' natives. Tho relations
between them and the American cavalry
at one time grew so strained that trouble
was momentarily expected. The Ameri
cans publicly denounced their acts."
Butler Practiced No Fraud.
SAN DIEGO, Doc. 7.â The Superior

of tho defendant, Butler. Two years ago
Dr. Butler traded a gold mining property

conveyance of the property. The court
decided that no fraud had been used and
refused to order a reconveyance.

BOY UNFOLDS
SOME SECRETS
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.â A number of wit
nesses, whose evidence was wanted to
show that ex-Bailiff James J. Lynch was
often in the office of Alexander Sullivan
when the latter was attorney for the West
Chicago Street Railway Company, occu
pied the stand in the Sullivan conspiracy
case to-day. Emory Warnc, Edward
Turner, P. H. Maroney ana Robert Hill,
all formerly connected with the Traction
Company's legal department, and F. Rich
clson, formerly in the city law depart
ment, testified. ,
Hill, who was an office boy for Sullivan,
was sprung as a surprise on the defense
late yesterday. He said that he had car
ried letters from Sullivan to Lynch and
that he had brought verbal communica
tions for Lynch to meet Sullivan. He
had seen Lynch and Attorney St. John in
Sullivan's office many timesâ as often as
twice and thrice a week. On cross-exam
ination the defense brought out the fact
that letters were delivered ln the open
courtroom of Judge Clifford, where Lynch
acted as bailiff. Assistant State's Attor
ney Barnes asked:
"You didn't wave them in the air, did
you?".
"No," Hill answered. "I slipped them to
him quietly." .. â  â¢-.-â¢' .V;
The testimony of Warne, Turner, Ma
roney, and Richelson supported Hill's
story that Lynch called often on Sullivan.
The defense on cross-examination brought
out assertions that. there seemed to be
nothing suspicious about the meetings.
Maroney stated that he had often seen
Dan Coughlin in Sullivan's office also.
John Gordon, husband of Josephine Gor
don, was a witness and told of forwarding
to Lynch in New York, under the name of
Conners, money which he received from
Dennis Ryan, the custodian of a fund
of 54500. which had been provided for the
support of Lynch during his exile. He
was followed by his wife, Josephine, the
last witness of the day, who corroborated
Lynch's narrative wherein it concerned
her. . and told â  of conversations she : had
had with St. John about her brother.-

SIGHT WRECKAGE
OF A SCHOONER
Steamship Men Bring
News of Northern
Disaster.
Lost Craft May Have Been the
Ralph J. Long of San
Francisco.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 7.-Accordlng
to news brought to-day from the north by
the steamship New England some small
vessel recently met disaster in the waters
off Queen Charlotte Islands. On Wednes
day afternoon, when the New England
was steaming southward past Banks Isl
and, a lot of wreckage was seen floating
on the water. Some of it was picked up
and was found to consist of the front
frame of a small ship's locker. The frame
was made of rock elm and had three
openings for drawers. The men who
picked up the wreckage saw a portion of
a curved taff rail, several . white-painted
boards, apparently belonging to & schoon
er's bulwarks, and a lot more broken and
splintered wood. No pieces bearing any
lettering could be discovered. All the
flotsam was in such a state of preserva
tion that it is not considered probable
that it had been in the water any length
of time.
It is believed here that the American
Echooher Ralph J. Long from Unalaska,
November 9, for Seattle, may have got
into trouble during the recent gales and
that the wreckage sighted may have come
from her. as she would have been in that
vicinity about the beginning of the week.
No other small craft is known to be in
northern waters. Judging from the size
of the ttotsam it did not come from a
large vessel.
The schooner Ralph J. Long should have
arrived in Seattle long ago, but she
stranded at Unalaska and for a time it
was believed a United States revenue cut
ter would be dispatched to rescue her pas
sengers, who were reported penniless and
starving. Just as the cutter McCulloch
was about to sail northward from San
Francisco, word was received from Un
alaska that the Long had sailed south
ward on November 9, fully provisioned.
The Ralph J. Long was a single-deck
schooner of ninety tons. She was built in
1888 at Bandon, Or., and was owned by A.
Frank of San Francisco, her home port.

Water and Power Company, owner of the

MURDER CAUSES
SECOND TRAGEDY
Grief of Victim's Widow
Deprives Her of
Reason.
Mrs. Delia Rader "Will Pass
Her Remaining Days ;!
in an Asylum.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Dec. 7.â Mrs. Delia Rader
was to-day for the second time commit
ted to the Napa Insane Asylum. As she
la now 50 years old it is uuitc probable
that she will end her days tnere. and this
seems to be the finale of an unusual fam
ily tragedy that had its opening chapter
five years ago.
John Rader was a goat and sheep
raiser of the Bald Hills section, near Gas
Point He and his neighbor. David Mau
pin. quarreled over pasture lands. As
Rader drew rein one day in the midst or
his children David Maupin shot him dead
from his saddle. Clay Taylor made a
famous plea in court for Maupin and ne
was acquitted. , ,
Mrs. Rader's mind gave way over grief
for her husband and ahe was taken from
her four son3 and daughter and sent to
the Napa Asylum. After a year she grew
stronger and was discharged. lor sev
eral year* Mrs. Rader has been living
with relatives in Trinity County. Re
cently she came back to ths old family
scenes at Gas Point. Ten days ago aha
suddenly became demented again and
since then has tried in many ways to
end her life. To-day her son, E. N. Ra
der, having given up hope, brought his
mother to town and she v. r a3 recommitted
to the asylum.

Method of Procedure and Stato Law
Sones of Contention in Zim
merman Case.
The case of "William Zimmerman, Ger
man teacher at tha Polytechnic 'High
School, who applied for. an injunction re
straining the Board xtt Education from
trying him on charges preferred against
him by Principal W. N. Bush, wm sub
mitted yesterday for decision by Judge
Murasky. Attorney Stephen V. Costello
appeared on behalf of the teacher and
Assistant City Attorney Brobeck defended
the board. _â
Brobeck Insisted that tho Board of Ed
ucation had absolute control of tho teach
ers ln the School Department by virtue
of powers conferred on it by the laws of
the State, which the charter could not
override. He called the court's attention
to the number of writs issued by the
courts, and declared that they greatly
hampered the board in , the discharge of
its duties.
Attorney Costello, who contends that
charges must be preferred by the Super
intendent of Schools, said that "while
there was no doubt that the State law
invested the board with the power to in
vestigate charges there was nothing ln
the statutes providing any method of pro
cedure. The charter has provided a
method," said Mr. Costello, "and by so
doing has not abridged in any way the
powers of the board."
Brobeck then said: "Supposing the Su
perintendent refuses to prefer charges,
then the board is powerless to act, ac
cording to your argument."
"The Superintendent will do hla duty,
I suppose," retorted Costello; "at least
the law presumes so."

SHIP A WITNESS

Friends of Alleged Mon

Active.
Sacramento County's District
Attorney to File Sensa
itional Affidavit.
Sswelal Dispatch, to TSÂ» Can.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 7.â A sensational
affidavit in the case Ng Yet, charged with
the murder of Chew Jew, and awaiting
trial in the Superior Court, has been pre
pared and sworn to by District Attorney
Baker and will be presented to thÂ© court
when the casa is called on Monday morn
ing. District Attorney Baker alleges that
a Chinese named Young Sam, an Im
portant witness for tho prosecution, has
been paid 5300 by persons Interested in
clearing the accused, and shipped to
China in order that his damaging testi
mony will not be available when the case
is tried.
It will be further alleged that friends of
the defendant have paid to thÂ© relatives
of the murdered man $300, as balm for
their grief and an Inducement not to be
too clamorous for the conviction of the
accused. Tho District Attorney will ask
for a reasonable continuance of thÂ© casÂ©
to enable him to obtain other evidence,
but as thÂ© testimony of Young Sam la
regarded as the most Important bearing
on the case, it appears that the crafty
Chinese have won a victory over the
prosecuting: officers by spiriting Young
Sam out of thÂ© country.

NEW USES FOR MUSIC.
"l ROM a time that precedes, the beginning oihis
â4 tory the effect of music upon the human system
was known to exceed the mere pleasure derived
from the concord of sweet sounds. When Saul
was disordered- in mind his attendants knew of no. better
way of healing the distemper than that of getting David to
play before him upon the harp and sing to him; and we
may.be sure that was not the only instance in those re
mote old days when music was resorted to as a curative
agent for diseases of one kind or another.
All classes and races of men appear to have learned
very early in their history of the value of music in rousing
the mental and moral energies of men and fitting them
for the performance of dangerous duties. It is a very low
race of savages indeed that has not a martial music which
it uses in times of war to incite the courage of its soldiers.
Among civilized races this martial strain has been devel
oped to a high degree of perfection, so that it now con
stitutes one of the chief divisions of the musical art.
Priests from the oldest times have made use of music in
the ceremonies of religion, and schoolteachers have been
hardly less earnest in resorting to it as a means of bright
ening the minds of children at their school work.
Thus from the most ancient days music has been used
in medicine, worship, war and education. In our own
time it appears a new use is to be found for it. Several
tests have been made of its availability for increasing the
efficiency of labor, and according to those who have made
the tests the results have been 'uniformly good. Some
time ago we directed attention to a report of the use ol
music in a cigarette factory, where it is said the experiment
proved that the girls worked faster and worked better, as
well as more cheerfully, while the music was sounding
than when there was none. Since then several other ex
periments have been made and the results are said to have
been equally satisfactory.
Among those by whom the industrial test of music
has been- made is Elbert Hubbard, publisher of the well
known Roycroft volumes. He is said to have placed a
piano in every room of his plant and to have found" that
the music not only provided a pleasant diversion for his
employes but increased and improved their work. He is
reported to have stared in a recent address on the sub
ject: "The time is past when music can be regarded
merely as an amusement for idle'women or a source of de
light for children. It has a higher and wider function, and
I have noticed that its effect upon the nervous system is
marked."
It is not in factories and publishing houses only that
tests have been made. The Atlanta Constitution reports
that one of the largest railroad corporations in the South
in employing negro workmen has made it a rule to select
two musicians to every_ fifty employes, since it has been
found- that "when inspired by the song of their leaders and
permitted to join in- the chant, as they keep time with
pick or shovel, the negroes are less inclined to be morose,
and can perform a greater amount of work with less
fatigue than when working in silence."
It hardly seems right that music, heavenly maid,
should be taken from the church, the camp and the court
and set to working for an increase of human wealth but it
seems she has to meet the common fate. This is a practi
cal world. If music can help industry it must get in and
SOME IMPRESSION OF THE CHARMING
ENGLISH POETESS, ALICE MEYNELL.
CALIFORNIA Is very far from
Olympus! To Us It is not given,
except at rarest intervals, to
look upon the faces of our di
vinities. We are all more or
less the readers of books, and
yet the writers of books cross
our paths but seldom. Our literary loves
dwell in the distance. "We must be con
tent with worshiping from afar, accept
ing the good things that they send us.
very much as children accept the offer
ings of Santa Claus; the greater our de
light with that which is accorded us the
greater our regret that the gracious giver
must always be invisible. "He Is a beauti
ful old man." every natural child has
thought of Santa Claus, "but oh, to sec
him. to touch him and to hear him speak!"
Most of us with emphatic literary affec
tions are thus child-like toward our Joves
âto see them, to hear them speakâ there
is a real thrill in the prospect! An idle
hero-worship, this sentiment is sometimes
called, but why? "We may read bi
ographies at length and be anything but
idle; we may righteously peruse chapters
that tell of Wordsworth's or of Tenny
son's personality; It is an indication of re
flned taste to Epend hours In the National
Portrait Gallery etudying the faces of
those who have made literature and his
tory. Should an Interest ln the personali
ties of those who are making literature
and history be less righteous or less re
fined?
Mrs. Alice Meynell, at present vleltlng
in San Francisco, ls one of the makers
of the literature of our time. No less
an authority than George Meredith has
classed her among the great English
women of letters. People who are famil
iar with' her writings and with the praises
bestowed upon her by such men as IU13
kiu and Coventry Patmore, or those who
have read the beautiful tributes in verse
by Francis Thompson, will expect much
of her personality and much will be ful
filled. A profound Intellectuality com
bined with the simplicity of a child, an
acute interest ln all life, ln all things
both great and small, with occasionally
the pardonable abstraction of the poet;
a eaint-like spirituality, and withal a
sense of humor that asserts itself in a
â¢well governed smile around the corners
of her mouth, are characteristics of Mrs.
MeynelL Her friend whom she is visiting
remarked to me concerning her: "She ls
a beautiful combination of genius and
eaint." I had long been acquainted with
the genius, the saintllness I divined at the
first meeting and was grateful for its ex
istence. Without the saint I might have
been afraid of the genius. As It Is, this
delightful combination of qualities ren
ders Mrs. Meynell the sweetest, the most
approachable of women. Never posing
herself, she requires no pose from those
who meet her. Her . physiognomy is a
tempting one to artists and yet adifflcult
one; the "heavenly light" that illumines
her countenance ls not easily caught â¢ by
pencil or brush.
A sketch of her by Will Rothsteln, that
recently appeared in the Critic, is simply
a caricature, conveying no suggesUon of
the qualities that distinguish her. Even
the portrait by Sargent hardly does her
justice, although containing much of her
beautiful Epirft. There Is an Interesting
bit of history connected with the Sargent
drawing. Coventry Patmore, as every
body knows, was an enthusiastic admirer
as well as a devoted friend of Mrs. Mey
nelL His physiognomy was most pecu
liar and impressive, and Sargent in pre
paring his series of prophets for the Bos
ton Public Library became possessed of
the desire to have him for a prophet.
The request was made to him with this
result; Mr. Patmore consented to pose as
a prophet on condition that Sargent make
for him a portrait of Mrs. Meynell. This
was agreed to and the portrait was made.
Mrs. Meynell comes of a most Interest
ing and talented family. The essay en
titled "A Remembrance" in "The Rhythm
of Life" is an exquisite description of her
father. Without knowing whom it con
cerned I had long been an admirer of the
personality therein described. "A man
whose silence seems better worth inter
preting than the speech of many another.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Loving literature, he never lifted
a pen except to write a letter. He was
not inarticulate, he was only silent. â¢ â¢ â¢
He had an exquisite style from which to
refrain. â¢ â¢ . â¦ it was his finest distinc
tion to desire no differences, no remem
brances but loss among the innumerable
forgotten." ; : VÂ£
Mrs. Meynell'a education was super
vised entirely by her father. With tho
single exception of a master of languages
she had. In fact, ho other Instructor. A
man of the most exquisite culture, he
made no practical application of his at
tainments except ln the education of his
children. Her. mother, as well, was a
woman of remarkable accomplishments.
She was a noted musician ln her day, a
pupil of Thalberg. and ranked well as

WHAT'S IN THE CANNIKIN:
THE consumption of alcoholic beverages is by no
means abating in the modern world. It must
not be assumed that drunkenness increases with
the increased consumption of liquor, for it is the
judgment of all observers that the advance in consump
tion is due more to the generality of the habit than to the"
increase in individual use. More people use liquor in mod
eration and fewer use it to excess. Drunkenness
is frowned upon by custom and fashion, while the mod
erate use of these beverages is more, general and more
generally tolerated. It is .possible, .-too,'.. that man by habit
is becoming more immune to alcohol, and suffers less,
therefore, from its use, than formerly, and has less inordi
nate craving for it.. ,
Taking six leading countries as the standard, their
consumption of wine, beer and spirits shows an increase in
the aggregate that progresses steadily. The yearly con
sumption of these is: United Kingdom, 15,000,000 gal
lons wine, 1,160,000,000 of beer, and 39,000,000 spirits;
France, 990,000,000 gallons wine, 196,000,000 beer
and , 71,000,000 spirits; Germany, 60,000,000 gallons
wine, 1,230,000,000 beer and 99,000.000 spirits; Russia.
45,000,000 gallons, beer, 90,000,000 wine and 125,000,000
spirits; Austria, 130,000,000 gallons beer, 376,000,000
wine and 97,000,000 spirits; United States, 20,000,000
gallons wine, 870,000.000 beer and 73,000,000 spirits.
We show up pretty well as the fourth in consump
tion of hard red liquor, though we are the second in popu
lation. Germany, Russia and Austria are all ahead of us.
We are the fifth in wine and the third in beer. France
leads in wine and Germany in beer.
Reducing the, whole consumption to proof alcohol
the record is interesliiig. The United Kingdom conr
sumes of alcohol 73,000,000 gallons; France, 143,000.000:
Germany, 111,000,000; Austria and the United States,
78,000,000 each.
The consumption per capita of pure alcohoi is:
France, 3.80 gallons;, Belgium, 3.10; Switzerland, 260;
Germany, 2.20; Italy, 2.10; Spain, 1.86; United States, 1.
After every university match we are told that footbail
fits men for scholarship and civic. life,. but now after the
match between West Point and Annapolis we are told it
fits them for war and stratagems. By and by we shall hear
of its introduction into business colleges as a means of
teaching the students how to sltand off a creditor and rush
a debtor. .
'It looks as if reciprocity would be put r on -the .shelf
with tariff for revenue only. Protection and prosperity. are
too good a team to be traded off for any, other that con be
brought forward.
It is said that despite the large army under his com
mand, Lord Kitchener has only 45,000 troops available for
pursuit of the Boers,. and it seems that those are tired.
a landscape painter. Having no taste for
society they preferred life on the,Conti
nent to life in England. Italy particu
larly attracted them and the memories of
Mrs. Meynell's childhood are associated
with a" beautiful old villa near Genoa,
terraced to the sea. Here she and her
sister, now Lady Butler, spent a number
of years k studying systematically, yet
mingling freely with the peasant children
about them. Evidently it was no part of
their father's educational plan to attain
culture at the cost of all human - sim
plicity. In fact one feels through an as
sociation with Mrs. Meynell the great
humanness of her character. Learned ln
It will; be seen that one gallon of alcohol divided by 365
gives a very low daily consumption, and if equally divided
wouljj hardly make that diminutive measure per capita
which sociable gentlemen call "a snoot full."
Belgium figures in the statistics as the greatest beer
drinking .country, with 42.2 gallons per capita; Great
Britain is second with 29.6, and Germany third with 23.5.
f One fact of great interest appears . in the American
consumption of wine, being 20,000.000 gallons per year
It is undoubtedly due to the rapidly increasing use of our
good California wines. ... As this State is the only. American
producer of true wine, it is evident that oitr vintners have
the promise of a -home market equal to the ab
sorption of their entire production. If they will
fake the same pains to .- study the tastes of that
market as carefully as exporters study the foreign mar
kets to which they cater, we may look forward to a de
mand at home that will make every, vineyard profitable,
and at. the same tim<5 serve the purposes of real temper
ance by replacing distilled â  liquor with a mild vinous
drink which has its best and most agreeable use as a part
of the diet. It is not a matter of speculation nor uncer
tainty that temperance is promoted in proportion, as we
teach the. appetite for alcoholic cjrink.;to be satisfied with
a beverage that. takes. the. place of tea and coffee at table.
Itis observed that an alcoholic beverage so used does not
become the vehicle of drunkenness.
Of course there are men capable of flooding an
empty stomach v w.ith dry. wine. â¢ Such men. prefer to irri
gate with whisky, which does ten times the harm with not
one-tenth the immediate discomfort.
While the statistics show a general average increase
in tlie consumption of liquor, they show 'also a decrease in
Russia, Scandinavia, Holland and the United States. The
use of whisky in this country declines as the use of wine
advances, and the vineyards of California may yet be
looked to for the supply of the national beverage, and the
glories of Blue Grass will fade and go into limbo along
with Monongahela and Robinson County.
The appointment of Congressman Mctcalf to a place
on the Ways and Means Committee is a compliment to
California, and it is also a proof of the wisdom of re-elect
ing good men to Congress for term after term instead of
changing every year, as some constituencies do.
Hawaii vvishes of this Congress appropriations for im
provements to the amount of $10,000,000, the Philippines
wish aboiit twice as. much and Porto Rico will apply for a.
million or two, so it is evidently the opinion in the islands
that an appropriation follows the flag.
The Charleston Exposition may not count for much
as expositions go in our times, but it is none the less no
table as an evidence that the city of State rights and
secession has quit talking politics and is ready for business.

THE DEAD HAND.
% * 7 E-suppo^ that only law will restrain the de
\ A I sire of nien^to'put'the quick under restraint
V V of the dead. Â£ .
â¼ " â  Men die and condition a devise to their
wives upon their remarriage and make that work forfeit of
the estate. Some undertake to control the religion and
<ome the politics of their heirs, even to the second genera
tion It is strange that a desire to dominate should sur
vive the grave and that the dead hand should be raised m
restraint of nature, and that the living shall be under or
ders from the dust.
One would think that the experiences of this brief
life would satisfy and that the dead palm would no longer
itch to hold the reins. To a normal mind it seems unnat
ural that any one can so value the sweets of power as to
cling to its post mortem exercise and expect to enjoy it in
the "cerements. Such expectation is the vanity of vani
ties, and the sooner courts curb it when directed to sticffl
purely personal rights as the right of marriage or remar
riage, freedom of conscience and natural selection of a line
of civic conduct, the better for the community.
A case of that sort has recently been before the Su
preme Court of New York. One McCombs of Dobbs Ferry
died leaving an estate worth $10,000,000. To one of his
daughters he refused equal share and put $300,000 in trust
to yield her an income of $10,000 only, if she marry Louis
Herzog. If she do not marry Herzog she to share
equally with her two sisters and brother. So it is $2,500,000
I without Herzog and $10,000 a year with him. The court
refused to construe the will and trust. It said that she has
not married Herzog and no one knows that she will ever
marry him, therefore the executors cannot execute the
trust, for its conditions are lacking. The executors must
take the responsibility of dividing to her her share of the
estate, or refusing to do so. She is not Herzog^s wife and
is clearly entitled to her full share. If she get it and then
marry him the troubles of the executors begin. The late

the proscribed daughter has the best of it so far.
Our advice to her is to get her share of the estate
and marry Herzog, if he is a decent fellow. Then let the
executors go into court to recover her $2,500,000. If they
get it they must create the trust and pay her $10,000 a
year, and if Louis is the right sort of a husband that will
keep the pot boiling.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1901.
KITCHENER IS CARICATURED,
BUT HE PROMISES TO HANG ON
LONDON. Dec. 7.â A letter Just received
from an officer in South Africa says that
a subaltern drew a caricature of Lord
Kitchener as Rip Van Winkle, leading a
centenarian soldier up a kopje. A staff
officer showed it to Kitchener and the
chief gave one of his grim, smiles and
â said, "It's an ugly prophecy, but if neces
sary we will hang on here until we are
that' age. Our duty Is to win, and we
will.".
The subaltern was paralyzed with ter
ror until assured that Kitchener had not
asked for the artist's name.

REGISTRAR'S OLEEKS -
WANT PAY TOR OVERTIME
Auditor Wells Refuses to Sign De
mands and. Tney "Will Appeal
to the Courts. â¢ f'V ;
The clerks In the Registrar's office, who
have been working overtime during the
last election and subsequent thereto, have
resolved to appeal, to the courts to de
cide whether they are entitled to extra
pay, notwithstanding that the charter
limits their salaries ito 5100 per month., j
This resolve on the part . of the clerks
was precipitated yesterday by Auditor
Wells, who refused to audit a number of
demands -aggregating $550 for | overtime.
As their salary for November would have
exceeded the sum of $100 per month - If
the overtime were paid. Wells ruled that
he could not sign the additional demands.
It Is intended to test a certain section
of the charter which, excepta the Tax
Collector's- office from the provision re
quiring city ofljeesito be kept open, from
8:30 a. m. to 5 p. m. The Tax Office is re
quired to be kept open during the busy
time of .tax collections until 9 p. m.%No
provision, however, has been made for
tho Registrar's office, and the clerks
claim that they should be paid for over
time. They say that tney have worked
on Sundays and nights,. though the char
ter specifies that eight hours shall con
stitute a day's labor. Two, of the clerks
have refused. to work nights on that ac
ccunt, and the Election Commission holds
that they cannot -be "compelled to do so.
Unless the others agreed it would' be im
possible for laboring men to register, they
being: employed during the daytime.

Medicine forced on the little ones loses half its power. Nasty,'
sickening medicine is an injustice to the dear little innocents who
can't protect themselves, makes them peevish and afraid' of the dose.
When a child hates the medicine, it will not be effective. Children
like Cascarets Candy Cathartic, ask for them and are kept healthy
always and easily against the damages of childhood's ailments.

UPHOLDS RIGHT
OF CRITICISM
Chicago Jurist Gives
Judgment in a News
paper Case.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.â Andrew M. Law
rence, managing editor of Hearst's Chi
cago American, and H. S. Canfield, a re
porter, who were sentenced recently by
Judge Hanecy to forty and thirty days,
respectively, in the County Jail for con
tempt of court, were discharged from
custody by Judge Dunne to-day.
In granting a writ of habeas corpus the
court said the matter hinged on whether
the case on which the American com
mented had been disposed of by Judge
Hanecy or was still pending. Judge
Dunne held that the case in question bad
been finally disposed cf by Judge Hanecy
â¢when he gave his decision from the bench.
The fact that the clerk had not entered
the order when the comment on the de
cision was printed and published, there
fore, does not show that the case was
still pending. The act of entering the
order on the record was merely a minis
terial act, Judge Dunne said.
Judge Dunne admitted that the arti
cles and cartoon which Judge Hanecy ob
jected to were clearly calculated to in
timidate and coerce the court, had the
court not already rendered its decision.
Judge Dunne admitted that the cartoon in
evidence was probably libelous and the
articles possibly so. Harsh criticism.
Judge Dunne remarked, Is one of the in
cidents and burdens of public life. He
continued:
I eee no reason â¢why a Judge should bÂ» offered
a different remedy for attacks In the public
print* than a President or a Governor or a
Congressman. Criticism of a particular official.
If Just, will do good; if unjust, will do no
harm. I am clearly of the opinion that the
language used in open court by Judge Hanecy
amounted to a final order disposing of the
ease under consideration, and that being a
final order under the doctrine of "contempt"
eft laid doivn in this State by our Supreme
Court In Storey vs. The People, that tha re-
Iators had a right to comment and criticize
that decision, even to the extent of libeling
the honored and respected Judge who rendered
that opinion, without exposing themselves to
prosecution for contempt of court.
Following Is Judge Hanecy*s comment
on Judge's Dunne's decision:
Judge Dunne had the power so to decide, but
he did not have the right. Any Judge has tha
power to let every prisoner oat of the peni
tentiaries, but they have not the right, nor
does anybody expect that they will.

SCANDALS SET
EUROPE ON EDGE
Marital Troubles of Boy
alties Disturb the
Rulers.
LONDON, Dec 7.-The domestic inf ellci
ties of European royalties have never,
come so prominently before the public as
have to-day the difficulties of Queen Wil
helmina of the Netherlands, the dramatic
circumstances of which form one of the
chief topics of conversation.
The romantic halo surrounding the
young Queen and the keen interest taken
in her marriage only help to accentuate
public curiosity and sympathy. Moreover,
It is realized that Holland's scandal may
have grave political consequences for
Europe, and hence its developments are
followed closely by statesmen. While
those best fitted to judge Incline to the
belief that it will all blow over for the
present there are grave apprehensions for
the future.
From a personal point of view England
Is more deeply concerned in the scandal
going on In Hesse, where one of Queen Vic
toria's granddaughters is on the verge ot
separation from her husband. This youth
ful marriageâ the Grand Duchess of Hesse
was only 18 when she exchanged her Brit
ish for a Continental titleâ has proved to be
one of the -most unsatisfactory among all
the loyal matches, and the climax, ilt is
believed, would have been reached before
this time had it not been for- the late
Queen Victoria's Imperious Influence.
The Duke of Edinburgh's other daugh
ter, the Crown Princess of Roumania, ac
cording to common report, also leads a
none too happy marital existence, though
recent rumors of an open rupture are met
with strenuous official denials. However,
no one in England would be surprised to
hear that she is figuring In a role similar
to that of her sister, the Grand Duchess
of Hesse.
Then there are scandals going on in the
courts at Belgrade and Lisbon, but these
ha.vÂ« been so long before the public eye
as to need no comment.

Frank Chandler of the Amalgamated
Association ot Carpenters and. -Joiners,
who is here as one of the -fraternal dele
gates from Great Britain, was Introduced
at the opening of the afternoon session.
He reviewed the labor conditions as they
now prevail in the British Isles. He said
his association organized a union in his
country thirty-three years ago and efforts
had been made in certain localities to
have Its members join the Brotherhood
of Carpenters. He pleaded with the dele
gates not to force the amalgamated mem
bers-to do this, or they, would sacrifice
much if they took such. action. .'
Benjamin Tillett of the British Trades
Union Congress made an address advo
cating socialism. Tillett held the atten
tion of the delegates for an hour 'and a
half. He said that the force that is do
ing more for labor than any other "is the
intellectual force of socialism." He- em
phasized the need of liberal contributions
of monfy to help labor In Its struggle for
better conditions and aided with Presi

sory arbitration. Gompers, in his annual
report made an argument In favor of
compulsory arbitration. Tillett said he
was opposed to leaving disputes to the
"prejudices of the courts." He believed
in placing these questions in the hands
of a board of arbitration made up of ex
perts.

Union Congress pleaded for more aid
from the federation. - He said. Canada pre
sented a wide field for missionary 'work In
the Interest of organized labor.' He
touched on the Chinese exclusion act and
said that Canada should also restrict Mon

the Asiatics on the payment of a poll

LABORIE MAKES
NO DISCLOSURE
Reasons for Rupture
With Dreyfus Are
Kept Secret.
PARIS, Dec. 7.â The general expecta
tion of sensational disclosures In Maltro
Laborie's explanations of bis rupture with
Dreyfus has thus far been disappointed,
as ho announced that his lips are sealed
by professional secrecy from telling the
story of the actual breaking of relations
with the Dreyfus family.. His articles up
to now have taken the form, of a personal
polemic against . Reinach and Bernard
Lazare, but they have gone to show how
wide is the breach between Dreyfus and
Reinach and the former's champion.
The friends of both sides are pained to
read such letters as Lazare writes to
Laborle. In which, declining to reply to
certain allusions by the latter, he says:
"It Is unnecessary for me to help you
In throwing down your own statue. You
appear quite able to do the work your
self."
The antl-Dreyfusard press naturally ex
ults over what they describe as a "display
of dirty Dreyfusard linen," and, with
Machiavellian Intention urge Jfaltra
Laborle, now that he has been thrown over
by his ungrateful friends, to reveal tha
whole Dreyfusard conspiracy against tha
army.
On the other hand. Tves-Guyot In tha
Siecle says the adversaries of Dreyfus are
mistaken if they Imagine that any proof
of his guilt will emanate from tha
polemics of his former friends, bnt ha
repeats his prediction that the Dreyfus
affair will dominate the elections of 1302.
as It did those of 1393.
The accusation of Major Carrier* tT'Ht
Governmental pressure had been pat upon
him to plead in favor of the release of
Dreyfus continues to be discussed, and
General de Galllfet again denied any part
therein, and challenges bis accusers to
arraign him In t&e high courts.

MISCHIEF MAKER.
A Surprise in Brooklyn.
An adult's food that can save a baby
proves itself to be nourishing and easily
digested and good fcr big and little folks.
A Brooklyn man says: "When baby was
about eleven months old he began to grow
thin and pale. This was at first attribut-
ed to the heat and the fact that his
teeth were coining, but, in reality, the
koor little thing was starving, his
"Hfriother's milk not being sufficient nour-
fchment
"One day after he had cried bitterly for
an hour, I suggested that my wife try
him on Grape-Nuts. She soaked two
tcaEpoonfuls in a saucer with a Mttle
sugar and warm millt. This baby ate so
ravenously that she fixed a second which
he likewise finished. It was not many
days before he forgot all about being
nursed, and has since lived almost ex-
clusively on Grape-Nuts. To-day the boy
is strong and robust and as cute a mis-
chief maker as a 13-months-old baby is
expected to be. . t- ; -
"We have put before him other foods,
but he will have none of them, evidently
preferring to stick to that which did him
so much good In his time of needâ his
old friend Grape-Nuts.
"Use this letter any way you wish, for
my wife and I can never praise Grape-
Nuts enough after the brightness It . has
brought to our household. These state-
ments can be verified by any one who
wishes to make a visit to our home."
F. F. McElroy. 256 South Third street,
Brooklyn, N. Y.
Grape-Nuts is not made for a baby
rW'd. but experience with thousands of
bibles shows it to be among the best, if
not entirely the best lit use. Being a
i-cientific preparation of nature's grains,
It is equally effective as a body and brain
builder for grown-ups.
CUSTOMS MEN
ARE SUSPENDED
lnree Revenue OflQcials
Charged With Bad
Conduct.
Accused of Releasing Two
Smugglers After Ca
rousing.
The not very edifying spectacle of cus
toms Inspectors carousing in saloons with
two smugglers whom they had under ar
rest, and allowing their prisoners freedom
for two daj-s, has been called to. the at
tention of Customs Collector Stratton and
the offenders have been suspended from
duty pending an investigation which will
result either in their exoneration or their
dishonorable dismissal from the service.
The suspended inspectors are E. C.
Broderick, A. M. Clifford and John B.
Peppin Jr. It was reported to Acting
Customs Surveyor St. John that the ac
cused officials had arrested on Saturday,
November 30, John and Joseph Alexander,
longshoremen employed on the Doric, for
smuggling a quantity of silks and silk
hats purchased by them from LÂ«ong How,
the sailmaker on the Doric, and that they
did not surrender their prisoners into the
custody of the proper authorities until the
following Monday. It is charged also that
immediately after making the arrest and
seizing the smuggled articles on the per
scn of one of the prisoners they went
with the smugglers into several water
front saloons and drank an indefinite
number of â¢â¢healths," all of which is al
leged to be conduct unbecoming officials
of the revenue service or of any other
service.
Collector Stratton will begin the inves
tigation nest week and will report the
facts to the Secretary of the Treasury.

Market-Street Values.
Thomas Magee & Sons, in their Real.
Estate Circular, give an example of in
terest concerning the increase in value of
real estate on Market street In this city.
The Circular says:
James L. Flood last month bought for $120,000
the frame building and lot on the northwest
side of Market street, 131:2 feet southwest of
Stockton. The lot has a frontage of 27 1-6 feet
on Market by a depth of 92:6 and 76 2-3 feet
through to Kills, with 22 feet rear front on
that etreet. This property adjoins on the south
west the gore lot on Market. Stockton and
Ellis, owned by Miss Flood. Few sales better
illustrate how San Francisco has grown and
Its best real estate increased in value than the
history of this small parcel of property, which
contains only 1S59 square feet. It was sold on
December 17. 1862. by A. and H. Wolf to Sarah
Jane Hull Icr $o200. It was resold on July 20,
15.G6, to John Grant, an old and hale pioneer
etili livine here, by Asa Hull and wife for
$10,5CO. Mr. Grant built fair two-story frame
Improvements covering the land. The building
was refitted two years ago by the present
tenant. Thomas Magee sold the property on
June 2, 1S75, for Mr. Grant to M. A. de La
veaga. for $61,500. and resold It aeain on Feb
ruary 15, 1S77. for $72,500 to the late Charles G.
Mason, discoverer of the Silver King mine of
Arizona. Mr. Mason's son is the seller now.
The rent of the property now. as we have said.
Is $550 a month from one tenant. When sold
for $61,50) in June. 1875. It was renting for $425,
and when it was resold in 1877 for $72,500 the
rents wÂ«!re the same. Now, when the property
resells for $120,000 it is renting for only $125
a month mere than that. The explanation of
the big advances in price and the comparatively
stationary condition of the rents, is due to the
reduction of interest rates, and the desire of
Investors not so much for high rates of in
come as for certainty and steadiness. Market
street secures the latter better than any other
meet. *

November a Light Mpnth.
G. H. Umbsen & Co., in their Real Es
tate Record, say of the transactions of
the last month:
November counts among the light months of
the year in the record of the transfer of sales.
This was chiefly owing to investors holding
back in the election period and for some days
following the announcement of the success ot
the Union Labor party candidates for Mayor
and three members of the new Board of Su
pervisors. At first there was a feelinsr of un
certainty and then one of distrust, but these
soon passed after the reassuring declarations
of the incoming Mayor and a calm review, of
the municipal situation. The latter half 'of
the past month developed some activity, anil,
if more were not done, it waa due as "much to
the disinclination of holders of business and
semi-business properties to accept offers aa for
buyers to make them. However, some of the
best prices ever paid for these classes of real
estate In San Francisco were received in No
vember, such as the $4000 a front foot given
by the Union Trust Company for the premises
on Montgomery street adjoining its bank build
ing, and figures given for Market street prop
erties. The prices paid for most other pieces
of realty were In general above those which
have heretofore prevailed. Little has been do
ing on the eastern end of Mission and adjoin
ing and cross streets as land there Is highly
held, but it is known that offers have been
made far In advance of those of the earlier
part of the year, while the disposition to pur
chase south of Market 6treet and, west of Third
is making itself more and more apparent. Ex
cept In a few of the outlying districts values
are advancing with the indication of maintain
ing their forward movement. â  i
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1901.
HARRY GREGORY
CHARGES FRAUD
Seeks to Prevent Dis
tribution of Uncle's
Estate.
Says Henry Campbell Is Not
Entitled to Represent
Heir.
Harry Gregory of Wayne County, Mich
igan, applied yesterday to the Superior
Court of this city and county for a stay
of the distribution of the estate of his un
cle, - George I>. Gregory, -who died in this
city In April, 1899, leaving an estate valued
at ?14,698, consisting of property at North
Beach and in the Western Addition, $5392
in bank and a number of â  promissory
notes.
The petitioner claims he has learned
that Henry Campbell, his brother-in-law,
has been collecting the share of the Greg
ory estate which wae coming to the father
of the petitioner, and . that | Campbell
claimed such right by virtue of a pretend
ed conveyance. .'â â¢ â 
The petitioner says that -if his father,
James Gregory, who Is entitled to one
eighth of the estate, executed such an in
strument he did so before he knew of the
extent of his brother's estate. The peti
tioner therefore asks that all further pro
ceedings be stayed until his right as the
heir of his father, James Gregory, be
passed upon. The records of the Superior
Court show that Edwin O. Tucker was
appointed special administrator of the
Giegory estate In "April, 1899, and that at
least two payments, one for $500, the other
for $750, were made to Henry Campbell on
account of the interest of James Gregory,
father of the petitioner. The estate was
handled by Judge Coffey, who signed two
oidcrs directing the partial distribution of
the estate, and who passed upon all the
claims presented against the estate. Greg
ory, in his petition, alleges that if Canip
bell possessed any document giving htm
the right to assume charge of James
Gitgory's share of the estate that it was
obtained by fraud and that he has good
and sufficient reasons for claimin.j that
iio such conveyance was ever made.

A CURB_FOR IT.
Not a Patent Cure All, Nora
Modern Miracle but Simply a
Rational Curs for Dyspepsia.
In these days of humbuggery-and de-
ception, the manufacturers of patent med-
icines, as a rule, seem to think their med-
icines will not sell unless they claim that
it will cure every disease under the sun.
And they never think of leaving out dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. They are
sure to claim that their nostrum is abso-
lutely certain to cure every dyspeptic and
he need look no further, v
In the face of these absurd claims, It is
refreshing to note that the proprietors of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have carefully
refrained from making undue claims or
false representations regarding the mer-
its of this most excellent remedy for dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. They m-ikc
but one claim for it, and that is that for
indigestion and various stomach troubles
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is "a radical
cure. They go no farther than this, and
any man or woman suffering from indi- â¢
gestlon, chronic or nervous dyspp.Dsia
who will give the remedy a trial wilinnd
that nothing is claimed for it that the
facts will not fully sustain. â 
It is a modern discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable ingredients acceptable
to the weakest or most. delicate stomach
Its great success in curing stomach, trou-
bles is: due to the fact that the medical
properties are such that it will digest
â¢whatever wholesome food is taken into
the stomach, no matter whether the stom-
ach is In good working order or not. It
rests the overworked organ, and replen-
ishes the body, the blood, the nerves, cre-
ating- a healthy appetite, gives refresh-
ing sleep and the blessings which always
accompany a good digestion and proper
assimilation of food. ,' .
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets no
dieting is required. Simply eat plenty of
v/holesome . food * and take these Tablets
at each meal, .thus assisting and, resting
the stomach, which rapidly regains its
proper digestive power, when the Tablets
will be no longer required. â 
Nervous Dyspepsia is simply a condi-
tion in which some portion or portions of
the nervous system are not properly nour-
ished. Good digestion , invigorates the
nervous system and every. organ In the
bedy. â  /. â â .:â â <â  ,' .-_i -.-,-.

Native Daughters.
The entertainment that was given last
week In aid of the Native Daughters'
Home will realize a very creditable sum
for that institution. The ladies of Buena
Vista Parlor, who gave their services to
the cause, are deserving of a great deal
of credit. Of the minstrels, the one who
demonstrated that she is a natural born
burnt-cork artist was Mrs. Ella Wehe.
and in the position of tambo she was as
good if not superior' to many male or
female minstrels who have taken the
place of end men. She was full of life,
witty and sang with so much gusto that
che was forced to give two encores. She
had two good seconds in Miss Tlcoulet,
the president of the parlor, and Miss Adel
Lignon. All of the performers received
many beautiful 'flowers.
The Christmas tree party and snowball
social that has been arranged by Darina,
the parlor of beautiful girls of the West

workers it Is bound to be a success.

MINE WORKERS
ARE STIRRING
Recent Rains Supply the
Means to Resume
Operations.
Progress of Developments
Promise to Be Very
Satisfactory. . > .
The last week has been a good one for
the miners of California, and Nevada, in
asmuch as considerable snow and rain
have fallen and the streams are tilling
up. Repairs on mills have been rushed
to get ready for the season's work, and
theie is general activity now all along
the line. Placer claims In the north are
reported to be in good shape for operat
ing. The feature of the time is still the
general prospecting for copper. A large
demand will undoubtedly be made for the
torthcomlng bulletin of the State Min
eralogist for the practical information
which it contains.' The scope of the pub
lication has been already indicated. It
will be out of the State Printing Office
this month. Every copper property in
the State is described and every prospect
is indicated.
Heports are received of large discov
eries of copper in Arizona. A correspond
ent of the Los Angeles Times, writing
from Jerome, makes the following state
ments:
This district has seemed to centralize in the
great United Verde copper mine, which has
made Senator Clark many times a. millionaire.
Two or three years ago miners began to .pros
pect . on adjuLning claims a; well as in the
tSlack Hills, and on Mingus Mountain, two or
three miles from the United Verde works, and
their search tor copper has been maintained by
encouragement from Eastern capital. ; The
theory long entertained that the United Verde
contained about all the really valuable copper
deposits in this region is being disproved re
peatedly, and Senator Clark's protracted legal
struggle for the Iron Mountain and Copper
Chier prospects in the Black Hills, ending in
a compromise in which he retained a hall in
terest, has demonstrated the Senator's con
fidence in the 'new property. Some experts be
lieve that the output from the Verde region
will be so enormous in a few years that the
production of the United Verde mine, the
greatest copper property in the world, will be
but one ol several great contributors to the
general output of the region.
Placers and Ledges.
According to the Yreka Journal, the
trouble between parties concerned in the
copper mine in the Preston Peak section
has been compromised. Late rains have
furnished sufilcient water to operate the
quartz mill of the Yreka gold mine at
Salmon River. There is water enough jn
Humbug Creek for the placer mines.
At Soulsby mine, so says the Tuolumne
Independent, the stamps run at night,
leaving the water power to run the hoist
in the daytime. The water has been
taken out of the old workings of the Sem
inole mine and underground work is pro
gressing. The Union-Democrat reports
that the Tanzy pocket mine near Sonora
has been yielding big bunches of gold
recently, and that the finds of the pres
ent year will net the owners $60,000. The
Stockton Smelting Company .has started
up its furnaces in the old Mason Reduc
tion Works and sulphurets iÂ»f the Black
Oak and Rawhide mines have been
treated-
Stephen Bowers, field assistant to the
State Mineralogist, who has been explor
ing the Slate Range and Spangler Moun
tain . in the vicinity of Borax Lake, re
ports that he examined a large deposit
of iron ore in the Slate Range and ad
joining country, the extent of which was
about one mile in length and one-half
mile wide. The deposit may prove to be
of value when a railroad that has been
already surveyed to pass the spot is con
structed. The pass between the Slate
RangÂ© and Pilot Knob, which debouches
Into Death Valley, is about 2300 feet
above sea level. Slate Range is about
4o00 feet higher.
A quartz ledge has been discovered by
S. Irvine of Nevada City In Sierra Coun
ty. Fourteen men are employed at the
Ruby mine, near Downievllle, taking out
ore
During the present year the Gwin Mine
Development Company has paid $115,000
in dividends, making J266.000 to date. The
mine is in Calaveras County. Laree
Quantities of old tailings have been
handled by the cyanide plant at Indian
Creek, near Murpnys.
Farmers Find Mines. "
The Mining and Scientific Press calls
attention to a familiar enough phenom
enon In Californiaâ the discovery of min
eral wealth in a locality that has long
been worked over without revealing its
hidden stores. The recent discoveries at
Mormon Island and Folsom placers are
referred to by the Press as follows:
t T 1 *^ ricl l Â£. lacer strike made near Mormon
If land andFoleom, in Sacramento County, is
another illustration of a good mine missed by
the old miners. Mormon Island was a big
placer mining camp in 1&49. In 1S69 the writer
recalls it as given over to the Chinese, who
were reworking the tailing piles of the 1849
miners. Its former brief glory Is not even a
memory to the present generation, and few of
the old miners who worked at Mormon Island
are still alive. The new discovery would ap
pear to be a rediscovery of the old channel of
the American River at this point The- miners
who worked out Mormon Island In the early
days knew nothing of channels. Gold was
where they found It, and when they did not
find It they moved on. Their successors for
years have accepted this ancient verdict of con
demnation. It has remained for farmers to
find the mine the miners missed. The incident
of farmers finding mines has been common
enough in the last twenty years In California
to base expectations for its recurrence. It is
hardly probable that this last discovery will
prove very extensive. It is likely only a rem
nant that, missed In the old mining. Is found
now. But It does not exhaust the possibilities
of the vicinity of Folsom that awat discovery
In strongly calling attention to them, an in
vestigation has been started that may lead to
the opening up to exploitation of a dozen or
more new old mines.
The mining plants in Meadow Lake
District, In Nevada County, will use
petroleum for fuel, which will be hauled
in wagrons from Truckee.
A- L. Johnson and E. S. Hadley of Sac
ramento, who bought a mine for a gold
property between Greenwood and George
town, in El Dorado County, have devel
oped a three-foot asbestos ledge, twenty
inches of it being fiber and the remainder
asbestos rock.
Twenty-eigrht men are now employed in
the old Wedekind mine in Nevada, now
known as the Reno Star. The property is
near Reno and was recently described in
this paper. The 100-foot level is being ad
vanced and the main shaft is down 140
feet Nine men are working at the Eng
lish mill, near Wedekind, getting the
plant in condition to develop 100 horse-
THE SAjS t FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1901.
AUTOLIGHT WINS FROM EONIC
IN A HAIR-RAISING FINISH
Qrayf:ld Captures the Burlingame Stake, Superbly
Ridden by Buchanan=- Favorites Do Well.
v|â s^ROM a spectacular point of view
1.,,^ the finish between^ Autolight .'and
| j '^ Eonic in the free* handicap over
Ji seven if urlongs at Oakland yester-
day must take precedence " over
the stake event in which Greyfeld was re
turned the winner.
Winnie O' Conner tossed the leg over
Autolight, .while Willie Buchanan piloted
the 100-pounder Eonic, the 9 to 10 favorite.
Down near ( the three-sixteenths pole Auto
light was bumped and nearly turned
around by Galanthus. Nothing daunted,
O'Connor went to work on the brown
horse and, later on bringing Buchanan to
a drive, was given the verdict in a finish
that se.nt the big- crowd present into a
wild state of enthusiasm. Many thought
Eonic had Tvon, so closely aligned did the
two'horses cross the wire, while twice as
many others were equally conndent Auto
light was the winner. When the numbers
were displayed, with Autolight first, It
â was greeted with tremendous applause.
Little Johnny Daly rode Galanthus and
no doubt the oumping was purely uninten
tional. The matter will be taken up by
the track officials, and quite likely a mild
fine will be imposed on the offending
jockey.
As on all previous occasions when a
course is in a heavy condition, there is
bound, to be more or less jostling, which
is unavoidable because of horses tiring.
Form was well upheld, four favorites, a
second and a third choice winning laurels.
Things seem to be breaking better for
"Bob" Smith after a long siege of ill
luck. He sent Grayfeld to the post in the
Burlingame selling stake at one mile and
a sixteenth, worth $12UO to the winner, and
.under Willie Buchanan's clever riding
the chestnut was returned winner. P.
Ryan's Obia at first had the call, but re
'ceded to 5 to 2, and J. Daly handled ths
mare about as well as a Chinaman can
throw a curved ball. Bernota cut out the
running for Grayfeld almost to the pad
dock. Then Buchanan crossed the
channel, scoring by more than a
length. If Hoar on Hortbn had not
grown over anxious way down the stretch
and drawn his whip the prize might have
been his. As it was Horton ran a dan
gerously close third.
P. Ryan's Plohn hooked up with a clus
ter of cheap ones in the opening mile run.
After six furlongs had been covered it
looked as if Lost Girl might land, but
the favorite stood for some vigorous urg
ing on O'Connor's part, winning easily at
the wire. Lost Girl at 20 beat First'Khot
for the place.
The St. Carlo youngster Hainault closed
equal favorite with Commissioner Forster
for the two-year-old sprint, and won all
the way. The Commissioner tired badly
the last furlong, losing the place to Dr.
Scharff. The latter was away badly and
ran a smashing good race.
Three fast ones in Meehanus, Frank
Bell and Hilee met in the five and a
half furlong scramble, and opinion was
about evenly divided as to the outcome.
Hilee finally closed favorite, but showed
no inclination to extend himself in the
going. Frank Bell could not lose Mee
hanus any part of it, and Caesar Young' <Â»
horse actually rolled in first, at the close.
Bell was sec-jnd.
jd^ii was istrfjna.
Bullman put up a highly polished ride
on old Wyoming in the last number, a
six-furlong run, nipping the decision by a
neck from Flamero. Heina de Cuba set
a sizzling: hot clip to the stretch, but
could not carry it to the wire. Rollick,
the second choice, finished a close third.
Track Notes.
Buchanan, who rode Landseer in the
second event, was fined $25 by Starter
Holtman.
Most of what is termed the "educated
money" went into the books on Frank
Bell. Meehanus seemed a better horse
than in any of his previous starts. - r-
Winnie C^Connor piloted two winners.
He certainly deserved v the reception he
received for his persevering effort tan Au
tolight, when it looked as if all hope of
success had flown.
Galanthus and John McGurk were all
power. Fourteen claims have been
bought by Salt Lake parties near Battle
Mountain. Bamberger Brothers have
purchased ten claims .in the same locality.
Platinum in Shasta.
The Redding Searchlight has the fol
lowing:
The value of platinum is beginning to be
appreciated by the miners of Shasta County.
There Is a brisk demand for the metal, which
commands a price of about $22 50 an ounce. A
great many of the miners have heretofore paid
no attention to this metal and have allowed
it to go to waste, being unacquainted with its
appearance and knowing nothing of the value
of it.
An aged German who Is engaged In mining
between Shasta and Keswlck was in town
Tuetday morning and shipped to the United
States Mint at San Francisco by express ten
ounces of the precious metal.
He Eald that he had been working his claim
for some time and had allowed the strange
metal to paÂ«s without particular attention, un
til -while at work one day a Swede approached
him and asked him why he did not save it
He replied that It was of no value, when the
Swede explained to him that it was more valu
able than gold. The miner immediately began
saving the metal and his first shipment of ten
ounces is expected to net htm the handsome
eum of 1 ?230.
The miner represents that he has a claim
which will yield large quantities of the valu
able stuff.
There have been some recent changes in
owners of mining properties in Southern
Oregon. The Victory mine on Soldier
Creek has become the property of Chi
cago and Tacoma parties. Placers at
Foot Creek have been transferred to a
Seattle syndicate. The Tip Top mine on
Williams Creek has been purchased by
A. C. Merrill of Tacoma and George St
John.
The Western Mining World, published
at Butte, Montana, says:
According to John Stanton, copper statistician
for the associated producers the production of
copper in the United States for October reached
a total of 24,098 long tons. This shows an in
crease for the first time in several months
being a gain of 753 tons. Of this gain 653 tons
were made by reporting companies and 200
came from outside sourcesâ the small mines
and from custom smelters as a by-product
This grain, which might have not been 'ex
pected, had full credence been given to cur
rent rumors of closed works and idle mines
changed the gmall decrease shown at the end
of September to a small increase over last
year's output. The actual gain for the ten
months was 237 tons, or 0.1 per cent" the
total for this year being 223,724 tons. That is
the production this year has been for teii
months practically the same as in 1900 and
there Is every probability that the full year
will show much the same result as the period
already passed.
An explanation of the plans for the re
opening of the Tombstone mines has been
given by Edward C. Xenney. who repre
sents the American Finance and Trust
Company, which is financing the Ameri
can Development Company of Arizona
Kenney says that E. B. Gage, since the
mines were flooded, has been securing
options and the syndicate now has con
trol "of sixty-eight mines in a group. The
plan is to operate them all from the
Grand Central. The shaft has been wid
ened until it is now 10x24 feet. It is pro
posed to put in pumps every twenty-four
feet to control the water. The ore of all
the mines will be taken out through one
shaft by meana of tunnels and electric
cars.
Women Neighbors Quarrel.
Mrs. Mary Dillon, 18 Georges â  street,
Potrero, was the complaining witness in
Judge Fritz's court yesterday against Mrs.
Mary Dalton, her neighbor, on a charge
of disturbing the peace. She testified that
on Friday Mrs. Dalton used vulgar lan
guage to her children and she remon
strated with her. A few minutes later,
â while she was in her kitchen, Mrs. Dal
ton attacked the house with an ax and
the force of the first blow knocked down
the stovepipe. The Judge convicted Mrs
Dalton, but reserved sentence for a week
to see how she would behave herself.

COOPER MAKES
A NEW DEFENSE
Raises Important Point
in N the Perjury
Case.
Alleges That the Grand
Jurors Were Illegally
Drawn.
When "Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper,
alias Ernest Moore Chadwick, appeared
before Judge Cook yesterday to plead to
the charge of perjury against him com
mitted during his trial for forgery in
Judge Lawlor's court. Attorney Murphy
made a motion to dismiss the indictment
of the Grand Jury, . raising an important
point on behalf of the defendant.
He claimed that the Grand Jury that
found the indictment had been illegally
drawn by Judge Dunne on June 3 last.
The statute provided that not more than
thirty names should be drawn from the
box and not less than twenty-live, but.
Murphy .contends, Judgi Dunne instruct
ed County Clerk Deane, wnile selecting
the grand Jurors, to draw all of the luo
names from the box. The Judge then
marked them off ' on a list of the names
as they were called out by the County
Clerk. This procedure has been declared
illegal by the Supreme Court. Murphy
contended, therefore, that as the Grand
Jury had been illegally selected it had no
power to return the indictment against
the defendant.
Chief Deputy Goddard was called and
testified as to the mode adopted ia select
ing the 100 names for grand jurors and
County Clerk Deane testified that he had
been instructed by Judge Dunne to break
the seal of the box and remove all the
slips, the Judge checking off the names
as he called them out.- The Judge then
selected the nineteen grand jurors. It
was ' done in open court and by instruc
tion of the Judge. â¢
The point raised took the District At
torney by surprise and by consent the
further argument on the motion to dis
miss was continued till Tuesday to give
the District Attorney an opportunity to
look carefully into the matter.
Attorney Murphy was successful in car
rying his motion to dismiss the previous
indictment . against Cooper for perjury
committed at the first trial ,of the for
gery charge before Judge Cook, and he
believes he will be equally successful in
the case at bar.

How to Prevent and Cure
. * Them.
â  \\.
.
People who are subject to coughs or
suffering from catarrh even in Its mild-
est forms should protect themselyes
against catching cold now, for more cases
of .consumption ars contracted in October
and November than at any other tlma
during the year. Just at this season ths .
sputa of consumptives expectorated In the
streets of every city and town during tho
summer has become . thoroughly dried
and, teeming with germs of the disease,
is taken up Into the air by the fall winds
and inhaled by every living person.
If the air passages are in a healthy con-
dition there ia no danger, but let . them
become inflamed by coughs and catarrh*
then these germs find lodgment on the in-
flamed surfaces, multiply with astonish-
ing rapidity and the disease consumption
is contracted. ' .
Heretofore the public as well as tha
medical profession have been at a loss to
prevent this terrible disease, but now that
Government statistics and health reports
have shown there is a way. and only
one. every person who contracts the dis-
ease has only himself to blame forth*
consequences.
It has now been settled beyond all dis-
pute that the new Dry-Air Germicide
HYOMEI will cure consumption, and
that coughs, catarrh, bronchitis and other
diseases of the respiratory organs cannot
exist where it Is used. HYOMEI protects
and cures by destroying the germs which
cause the disease, and which cannot be
reached by stomach medicines. Every
weak lunged or catarrh affected person
should use It dally.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 7.â For the sec
ond time within forty-eight hours â¢ train
wrebkers have sent " an ' Oregon S train
crashing into the ditch. The California
Express on the Southern Pacific, which
left San Francisco yesterday morning and
was due in this city to-night, was
wrecked 600 feet south of the depot at
Salem at 5 o'clock this morning. Fire
man Silas L. Fish of Portland was killed
and Engineer W. : H. White seriously in
jured. â¢ . â¢ â¢â¢â¢'
That the disaster, was the work of
wreckers the company employes are con
vinced. An examination of â¢ the track
shows that a -switch was left-half open
and the lock taken away. The engine ran
upon the switch, while' the tender stayed
on the main line. â¢
Thi3 wreck, following so closely upon
that of yesterday, when obstructions upon
the raHs sent eastbound passenger train
No. 2 on the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company line into the ditch near
The Dalles, has caused consternation in.
railway circles. The object of- the wreck
ers is hard to fathom, as it is apparent
that the motive is not robbery. That
they are actuated by a desire for revenge
likewise seems improbable, as they: have
not confined their operations to a single
road. In yesterday's wreck Engineer
Maurice Cavanaugh was killed and -Fire
man Frank Chase injured. > >
"When the California express left the
rails near Salem this morning Engineer
White was caught under the wreckage
and held there an hour before being res
cued, but his Injuries are not considered
fatal. Expect the fireman and engineer,
no one on the train was hurt, notwith
standing the fact that the engine and the
mail, express and baggage cars all went
into the. ditch.
At the scene of the wreck there Is a
trestle about fifteen feet high over Mill
Creek. The engine plunged into the creek,
turning over on its side, and the mail car
piled on top of It. The express and bag
gage cars left the track on the opposite
side from the engine and mall car. The
day cÂ»ach was derailed, but remained up
right The Pullman sleeper and the pri
vate car of Superintendent Fields re
mained on the track.
The train was running about ten miles
an hour at the time. The track was torn
up for more than 100 feet, blocking traffic
for. . several hours. The Albany, local
train, due in Salem at 6:30 o'clock, was
turned back to bring the overland pas
sengers and malls to Portland.

ITS INSTALLATION IN PUBLIC
Instructs Officers in Their Duties With Impressive
Ceremony and Presents Rich Jewel to the
> Retiring Matron.
j*^ OMMANDERT HALL, was crowd
// ed to Its limit last evening, the
vL_^ occasion being the public instal
\^^ lation of the new officers of Cali-
fornia Cliapter of the Order of
the Eastern Star. There were an unusual
number of members of the order present,
for It had been whispered around that the
retiring matron was to be presented with
the richest Jewel that was ever made in
this State for one who had held that
office. There were present many friends
cf the members, anxious to witness the
ceremony of charging the officers as to
their duties and Inducting them Into their
several offices.
The hall was decorated with evergreens,
while at each of the several stations
there was a profusion of sweet smelling
fiowers, and above all shone the Templar
cross In the east, flanked with large
American flags. The paraphernalia Is the
most elaborate and beautiful of any in
this jurisdiction. It consists of an Illu
minated altar resting on the central star
with Its five points; at which were chairs
of burnished gold covered with heavy
Eilk. Each chair bore in embroidery the
particular emblem off the five officers.
Adah, Ruth, Queen Esther, Martha and
Electa. who occupy them.
To the right of each of these was a
nandsome marble-white pillar, surmount
ed with a crystal bowl filled with fiowers
of the color cf the points of the starâ
blue, yellow, white, green and red. Each
pillar was capped with a different capi
tal, nve styles of architecture being rep
resented. Each has a deep symbolical
ElgniScanee in Masonry.
Officers Enter the Hall.
In the east sat the installing officer
who was the outgoing matron, Mrs Liz^

for eighteen months; 'Worthy Grand Ma

Captain Hazzard, Who
i Aided in Aguinaldo's
Capture, Arrives.
Captain Hazzard, U. S. A., was among
the arrivals from Manila yesterday. . He
registered at the Occidental. The distin
guished officer won fame through his
bravery in the Philippines. He was one
of the party of five Americans that cap
tured Aguinaldo, near Palanan.
The party â was composed -of General
Funston, his aid, Lieutenant Kltchell;
Captain Hazzard, Lieutenant Hazzard
and Captain Newton. Seventy-eight
Macabebes, enemies of the Tagalogs, were
Â£ilso chosen by Funston to form the body
of the command. The Macabebes were
mted out In castoff insurgent uniforms
and the Americans donned field-worn uni
forms cf privates. Three days' rations
were provided and each man was given a
rifle. The Vicksburg was chosen to take
the daring: command to the East Coast,
near Palanan. Arriving at Casigman, the
party was landed. Three Macabebes who
tpoke Tagalog fluently were sent into t5e
tov.n to notify the natives that they
a T'ere bringing additional forces .and im-
American prisoners. â¢ Over 'the
atony passes and through dense jungles
ttie adventurers tramped. When only
eight miles from Agulnaldo's rendezvous
their provisions gave out and they were
too weak from exhaustion to move
A messenger was sent forward to Agui
naldo begging for food. The rebel chief
tain promptly replied by dispatching rice
United States Mrs. Mary Flint, Grand
Secretary Mrs. Kate J. Willats and a
number of other grand oflScers, matrons,
patrons and past officers.' The scene as
the new officers were marshaled into the
hall by Minnie G. Stebbins and ranged in
position around the altar to take the ob
ligation was a very pretty one. After the
obligation, the answering of questions by
the worthy matron-elect as to her fealty
to the order and the offering of a prayer
by J. George Leibold, chaplain, the offi
cers were charged as to their specific du
ties In a very impressive manner. The
officers who were so charged are:
Bertha Warner Stark, worthy matron:
Phineas Fanning Ferguson, worthy patron;
Mary Wittman. associate matron; Isadora Hor

all marched into the town and presented
themselves to Aguinaldo, who cane out
on the porch of his house to see. them.
The spokesman so completely hoodwinked
Aguinaldo that he did not suspect the

they secured favorable points of vantage.
At a given signal the- entire party

REV.MULLIGAN
MAY BE BISHOP
Is Mentioned for Promo
tion to Old See of
Monterey.
Report Current That r Four
Prelates Will Be Ap
pointed.
Advlces from Washington are to the
effect that the Right Rev. : George Mont
gomery, Bishop of the See of Monterey,
is . to receive the appointment of Arch
bishop of Manila.
These reports state that the appoint
ment will be made as a result of the
meeting of the Archbishops o
recently held in Washington. Arch
bishop Riordan was present at this meet-
Ing, end it is declared that he made a
strong appeal at these executive meet-
Ings on behalf of Bishop Montgomery.
It la also stated from Eastern advices
that there will be four Archbishops ap
pointed. Mgr. Bernarjuna Nozaleda de
Villa,' at. present Archbishop of Manila,
is expected, to return to the "Philippines
for a year to straighten out all of his af
fairs before retiring. Father Fitzgerald,
who is at' present acting as Archoishop
of ..Manila, has made a splendid record
In the Philippines. He went to the isl
ands as chaplain of the Twenty-first In
fantry. To him much credit is due for
the harmony- that exists between the old
Spanish clergy and the American .Cath^
oilc priests tnat arrived there during the
late- war. - It Is conceded that Father
Fitzgerald will be selected as one of the
four Archbishops appointed from Home
when the names are announced.
Should the Right Rev. George Mont
gomery be elevated to an arcnblshopric
great interest will be aroused In Cali
fornia as to who will be his successor.
It is thought to be more than probable
that the Rev. Patrick B. Mulligan, who
has held the important office of secretary
to Archbishop Riordan for several years,
will be the next Bishop of the diocese of
Monterey. Father Mulligan has every
thing in his favor, as Archbishop Rior
dan greatly admires his secretary. Father
Mulligan Is now about 37 years of age
and has great executive ability. . .-
The selection of a Bishop for the dio
cese of Monterey is made only after care
ful deliberation. The Archbishop of San
Francisco, the Bishops of Sacramento
and Utah meet and select the names of
three men whom they think the most
capable. to fill, the exalted position. c"-The
pastors of Los Angeles also -meet and
they also send to Archbishop Riordan the
names of three priests who they think
would fill the office with : honor. These
names are -then sent back, to Rome for
final decision. . , , .
It is admitted, however,: that the Arch
bishop s- selection would-be roost favored

SYMPHONY CONCERTS ATTRACT
ATTENTION AND THEATERS ALL
ANNOUNCE BILLS OF MERIT
Lovers of Harmony Look Forward to Coming Treat,
Their Appetite for Husic Left Unsatisfied by
Â§ \ Singers in Grand Opera,
JT is pleasant to be able to announce
that the subscription sale for the
three symphony concerts to be given
under the auspices of the San Fran-
cisco Symphony Society has much
more than fulfilled the expectations I of
the officers and members of the society.;
The single seat sale will open next", Tues
day morning at Sherman- & Clay's ' music
store. It Is hoped that the sale will ex-'
hibit the same encouraging features * as
that of the subscription seats. â , â  \
The first concert of the series will take
place next Friday atfernoon at 3:15 sharp,,
by the way, and also with' the excellent
proviso that no one will be seated during
the performance of a number. Mr. Stejri
dorft is pleased, and with good reason,
at the "form" of his men. Rehearsals are
going with a continued increase of en
thusiasm. Giulio Minetti has been ap
pointed concertmeister, and in the choice
Mr. Steindorfl has shown the wisdom and
tact that, as much as good musicianship,
go to make the good leader. Mr. Minetti
is thoroughly well equipped for his im
portant post and is a valuable acquisi
tion to the strength of the orchestra. Mr.
Steindorfl will also have under his baton
almost all of the best orchestral material
in San Francisco, and it is not a little to
the credit of the city that flfty-flve mu
sicians of the caliber of those to be found
in the symphony orchestra can be gath
ered together here. It now only remains
for the public to do its part as nobly aa
it has done during the recent opera sea
son, but with the further impulse of help-
Ing the local musician. No more signifi
cant musical movement has been inaug
urated in the city since the Scheel sym
phony concerts and none with a fairer
promise of success. .It is to be devoutly
hoped all round that the series' will be
successful, no more infallible measure of
a community's musical standard being
avallai..*. than that of the standing of its
symphony society. As an educational:
means it. is unequaled. and as music pure
and simple the symphony remains unap
proached. There are all kinds of use
fulness open to a standing orchestra also

Hofmann comes in the spring, also Nor
dica and Geraray, and there is' already'
gossip concerning a joint concert wit:i
singer and orchestra, and the orchestra
with the famous pianist and cellist. It
all depends on the public that has so far
done nobly, but all thejoupport possible
is essential to a solid suwess.

OWNS PROPERTY
Lena Eisner, administratrix of the . es

stein, who died September 16, 1900, is suing
J. B. Reinstein, her brother, to I recover
moneys and property in his possession,
which she claims Is part of her father's

She claims that a life insurance policy
policy for $15,000 left by her father was
made payable to J. B. Reinstein, the de
fendant, as' security for certain sums ad
vanced by the defendant to -her father to
pay the premium on , the policy. The
property In question Is a one-half
Interest in a lot on Ellis street, west of
Van Ness avenue, which also stands in
the name of the defendant. "'
Mrs. Kisner claims that before her fath
er's death he put the property in his son's '
name to secure him against loss ! for
moneys advanced- to' pay taxes and other,
expenses. ; ::U\S- v ;
The advances made by the defendant,
alleges Mrs. Eisner, do not amount to
$15,000, and . she asks! the- court- to 'direct
her brother to render an accounting and
show thereby the exact sums he luane'd
his father. â¢ â  . >V'
-Mrs. Eisner alleges that the property
and the money received by Reinstein is
part of the estate of Oscar Reinstein, not
withstanding the fact that it stands in the
name/ of J. B. Reinstein, and that the de
fendant, should be compelled to turn it
over to. her as administratrix of her
father's estate." Her suit Is based on the
allegation that the value of the Insurance
policy and thejane-half interest in the
Ellis-street property is greater than the

much the faster. They ran like sprinters
and are credited with six stolen bases,
fchay, the shortstop of the pennant win
ners, accepted seven difficult chances
without an error. Irwin was not so suc
cessful, accepting four chances and being
â¢chaged with one error. In the latter case
the ball apparently belonged to the left
fielder, but Irwin made a gallant try for It
and failed. This left Reilly safe and he
was immediately scored by Nordyke's hit.
Lajoie did not score a hit off Whalen.
In the sixth Whalen hit him. possibly by
accident and possibly to prevent him
swelling his hitting record.
San Francisco was first at bat and the
quick action of the Eastern players was
at once in evidence. Nordyke sent the
ball down the left field line for a snigle.
Wilson hit to Irwin at second, doubling: up
Nordyke. Hildebrand struck out. For the
visitors Barrett bunted safely. Pickering
and Davis struck out and Lajoie hit to
pitcher and was out at first.
Inu the second inning Schwartz was site
on Davis' error, the first baseman letting
the ball slip through his fingers. Pabst
was given a pass to first. Krug flew out.
Shay forced Pabst at second and Reilly
retired the side, gclng out at first on a
bunted ball.
Shay commenced his preat work as
shortstop in the visitors' half of the sec
ond. He threw Bradley, Mercer and Sul
livan out at first, fielding: hits which were
difficult to handle.
The WfiFp* went out quickly in the
third. Whalen flew. Xordyke walked,
Wilson fouled out r.nd Hildebrand flew
put, retiring the side.
Pickering" Scores First Run.
The visitors made their only run in th<Â»
third. Fraeer hit safely, but was caught
stealing second. Earrett singled and met
the same fate as did Fraser at second.
Pickering sirurled and stole second on
Cousin Parke'Wilson's bad throw. Davis
singled, sending the ball to right field and
scoring Piclering. Dav's sto'e sjcoiuI
and went to third on Wilson's overthrow, i
Lajoie was the next man up. As any
kind of a safe hit meant a run the spec
tators watched the play breathlessly. Th^
best the mighty batsman cou'd do was
a little hit to Whalen, who threw him
out at first.
In the fourth Schwartz hit one appar
ently well above Third Baseman Brad
ley's head. Bradley reached for and cap
tured it, robbing Schwartz of what looked
like a two-bagger. Pabst flew and Krug
was out at first.
Shay was much In evidence in the
fourth inning. Bradley singled to deep
left and stole second. Mercer struck out.
Irwin was out at first after a great stop
by Shay. Sullivan met the same fate at
Shay's hands.
The sixth had no returns for the Wasps.
Hildebrand walked. Schwartz sacrificed
and Pabst and Krug were out at first.
I-ajoie who. from his apeparance on the
field, is not the most amiable man In the
wcrld, had much to ruffle his temper in
the sixth. Davis, who preceded him, was
thrown out at first by Shay. Lajoie was
then hit by Pitcher Whalen, to the visi
tor's evident disgust, as he apparently
â wanted a chance to show what a handy
man he is with the bat. As though this
was not enough he was called out Imme
diately afterward by Umpire "Jim" Mc-
Donald for running down to second be

Both Schmidt, who pitched for the East

were at times wild. Schmidt was the first
to go In the air. In the sixth Inning oc
curred most of the trouble.
Rellly singled and went to second on

ind Reilly collided with Steinfeldt. who
tell like a log. He was unable to get up
on account of a badly wrenched ankl<;
and had to be carried from the field. Van

and Doyle went to center. When play
wa* resumed Spies made first on a bunt
and the bases were full. Schmidt Bent

Htmphill singled to left, scoring Kelly
and Spies. Householder's two-bagger

Open Event.
Palo Alto Is First Choice in
the Union Park Spe
cial.
" Good coursing marked the run-down of
the open stake yesterday at Union Park.
Strong hares played an important part in
the day's sport and made the courses as a
rule long and hard trials. Relief dogs
were called into play oh several occasions
and -.in- more than one instance the hare
beat the combined efforts of its pursuers.
The talent had the better of the argu
ment from a betting standpoint and
picked the winner in air but eight of the
three dozen trials.
In the defeat of St. Ives, however, Ihe
wise ones were given an expensive set
back. " Sharman's courser was slipped
with Kelly & Hanley's Lusmagh L:ias
and an easy *victory was, predicted for
him. When the hare was liberated St.
Ives' chances were considered so good
the knowing bettors were laying 10 to 1
he would get the flag. St. Ives took the
lead but in the work the Lass outpointed
him and when the course was ended she
had the long end of a 13-10 score.
Imperial beat May Hempstead, a 1 to 3
choice. Ben Kirby beat Gramercy, Warco
beat The Levite, Black Bart beat Master
Workman at-1 to 2, Fannie Hughie beat
Agamemnon, Miss Brummel beat Clarice
at 3 to 5 and Lilac beat Candelaria at 2
to 5.
Probable winners in the second round
are Leola, Tralee Boy, Prompto, Courage,
Cold Shivers, Jewess, Sleety Mist, Freeze
Out, Gold-Bug, Rural Artist, Fair Oaks,
Minnie Sankey, Golden Garter, Fannie
Hughie, White Hat,. Firm Fellow, Liber
ator and Castaway. . _
In the long odds book Freeze Out and
Tralee Boy are even favorites at 4 to 1,.
Rural Artist 6, liberator and Castaway 7,
Merrimac. and Firm Fellow 8. With any
kind of even coursing Freeze Out should
win the stake. â¢
In addition to the open stake finals a
special event made up of sixteen cham
pion coursers will be run to a conclusion.
Palo Alto is favorite for honors at even
money, Charta is second choice at 5 to 1.

ALAMEDA FOOTBALL TEASrt
Persistent End Bunning of the Win
ners Proves the Most Interest
ing Feature of Game.
By a score of 11 to 0 the Signal Corps
aggregation of pigskin kickers defeated
the Alamedas yesterday afternoon at the
Sixteenth and Folsom streets grounds.
Despite the top-heavy score, the game
was interesting. Neither side displayed
any team work and interference was to
tally ignored. The features of the game
were the persistent end-running of the
Signal Corps' halfbacks.' In the flrst half
Hooper, right halfback for the Signal
men, executed a 70-yard run and carried
the ball across the goal line. The second
touchdown was achieved principally by
constant line bucks. During the second
half the pigskin was zigzagged up and
down the gridiron, but neither goal was
in danger. George Dinsmore and Whip
pie of the University of California were
the officials. The teams lined up as fol

Garden, New York.
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.â The winter In
door bicycle season was opened at Madi

Interest in Sport Vasco.
v Eder Jal, the. royal Spanish handball
game, drew a large crowd to Central Park
yesterday. The greatest Interest was
manifested in the contests by the specta
tors and the players were frequently
cheered for their marvelous dexterity.
The players, who have all been brought
here from the City of Mexico, are adepts
at the game. Their ability to wield the
"chistera," the apparatus used to catch
and cast the ball, is amazing. They are
able to hurl the light rubfcer ball from
one end of the "cancha," or court, to, the
other and cause it to strike with unfail
ing accuracy inside the required space on
the front wall. One of the features of
the game Is /the interest and life which
the players put into the contests.'
A game will be played this afternoon,
commencing at 2 o'clock, between cham
pion teams. The game is rapidly coming
to;the front. as. one of the most exciting
sports ever introduced here. A team ar
rived yesterday from Madrid, .the mem
bers of which are credited with being the
champions of the Basque provinces,
where the sport had Its origin. -

VANCOUVER, B. C. Dec. 7.â The col

Cape Flattery. When nearly 100 miles off
Cape Flattery yesterday morning the Ma
ria sighted a four-masted steel bark. She
was light and her ballast evidently had
shifted, so that she had a list of forty
rive degrees. The vessel was riding at an
chor and there was no apparent danger of
her turning turtle or otherwise coming to
disaster. A. signal of distress was flying
from her mast, but no person appeared
aboard.
The Maria went as close as she could

Captain Czerlick was unable to make out

southwest at the time the Maria left and
it is probable that the sailing vessel will
make a complete investigation.

As the result of a wound that was
caused by a steel hat pin being forced into
her bead. Miss A. LÂ». Rodgers of 1424
Franklin Btreet is lying dangerously ill.
Miss Rodgers was walking along a down
town street yesterday afternoon when a
boy allowed an awning: in front of one of
the stores to descend upon her head. The
awning struck the hat pin at such an an
gle that it was forced into her head. She
uttered a scream from the pain that en
sued, but in a moment had recovered her
composure and withdrew the pin with her
own hands. She did not pay any attention
to her wound, thinking little of it, but
later in the afternoon she fainted and was
taken home by friends. A physician was
called to attend the young woman and he
discovered that the pin had , pierced the
head at a dangerous point, nearly entering
the brain cavity. Miss Rodgers has been
constantly under treatment and she now
holds an even chance for recovery, al
though there is danger of blood poisoning.

CALL SOUNDS
FOR MISSIONS
Episcopal Conference
Finds Need of Active
Work.
ROCHESTER, N. Y.. Dec. 7.-The Epis
copal Missionary Conference came to an
end to-night. In the opinion of prominent
divines It has brought out distinctly the
following things:
The Episcopal Church has a call to mis
sion work in Latin American lands; it
sadly needs young men for mission work
both at homo and abroad: its present sup
ply of funds for prosecuting its mission
work and for entering upon Its larger op
portunities is inadequate; the laity and
even some of the bishops and clergy are
responsible for the apathy which prevails
throughout the church toward missions;
the church. at large needs a revival, a
fresh baptism of the holy spirit and sys
tematic instruction in order that zeal for
missionary work may. be aroused, stimu
lated and sustained; the men of, the
church should be systematically organized
for the purpose of coming to the aid of the
missionary cause and sharing the burdens
which have so long devolved upon the
women and children.
The Right Rev. Peter T. Howe, bishop
of Alaska, said: ,
"We sadly need money for schools and
for helpers. * Wo are the only denomina
tion in Alaska that, trains the natives to
help us in our mission Wjork. We have
three hospitals in Alaska. We want to
build more, especially -onfi at Cape Nome.
Our native schools could be planted every
where, but we have not the money to
plant them." : .

DEATH CAUSED
BY ANESTHETIC
Patient Dies While Being
â¢ Prepared for Oper
ation.
Case Is Placed in Hands of
the Coroner for an In
vestigation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
ins Broadway, Dec. 7.
While being placed under the Influence
of chloroform preparatory to undergoing
an operation Mrs. Nellie Bell Sherer, 25
years of age, died suddenly this after
noon at her residence, 513 East .Twenty
fourth street. The patient was In charge
of Dr. A. It. Cunningham and Dr. H. J.
Lackey.
The death of Mrs. Sherer, who is also
known as Mrs. Nellie Bell MoChesney.
occurred suddenly and under such circum
stances that It became a matter for pub
lic Investigation. - The case Is now In the
hands of Coroner Mehrmann. That offi
cial will determine whether an Inquest
will be necessary after he has completed
his examination. ,
Mrs. Sherer had â  been In . the doctors'
hands for some time. An operation for ab
dominal trouble having been decided upon
by the medical attendants, she was pre
pared for the ordeal to-day, arrangement*
having been made for the operation to be
performed at her mother's residence,
where she was staying.
Customary preliminaries were arranged
for the operation, which was of such a
character as to require the use of the
anesthetic. The patient, according to
the report to the Coroner, was examined
as to her ability to stand the anesthetic
and then the surgeons began to adminis
ter it.
' While the chloroform was being given
Mrs. Sherer began to show signs of dis
tress. The indications pointed to the
weakening of the heart under the effects
of the chloroform. Stimulants were ad
ministered, but no reaction could be se
cured, the patient succumbing from heart
failure.
When requested to give an explanation
of his connection with the unfortunate
case Dr. Lackey said: "I have nothing
1 to say upon the subject. If you want ln
; formation go to the Coroner."

CORPSE LASHED
TO SEWER PIPE
Infant's Body Is Found
Near a Wharf in
Alameda.
Murder May Have Been Done
and the Police Will
Investigate.
AULMEDA. Docl 7.â Lashed fast with â¢
piece of sash cord to a section of terra
cotta sewer pipe, the dead body of a baby,
girl, apparently about two months old,
was discovered this afternoon by Fred
Johnson of the sloop Gazelle, tied up at
the Walnut-street wharf on the estuary.
Johnson first observed the remains from
the deck of his boat yesterday as they
were being washed about by the action
of the tide In the shallow water near the
shore, but says he paid little attention to
them, as he .then thought they were those
of a. drowned pup. To-day the body drift
ed In nearer to the Gazelle and Johnson
discerned that the object he first believed
was a dead canine was the corpse of an
infant. With the assistance of two boys
the little body was taken from the water
and Deputy Coroner James Fowler was
notified of the find by Wharfinger OltU
Zingg.
There was no clothing or anything on
the body by which It could be Identified!
neither were there any external marks
of violence noticeable. The remains are
those of a perfectly developed child. Tha
cord which bound the body to the sewer
pipe was tightly wrapped several times
around the dead Infant's breast.
Deputy Coroner Fowler said:
"This case appears very mysterious ta
me, and as there might have been mur
der done I reported the matter to Chief of
Police John Conrad, who intends to mak*
an investigation. I could detect no signs
of violence on the body and whether tha
little one died and was thrown into the
estuary or was tossed in alive and
drowned' It , Is difficult to say. I should
Judgro that the remains are those of a
child from six weeks to two months of
age. If It was an instance where a child
died and its parents were too poor to
bury it, I think it would have been more
likely for them to have Interred it secret
ly, rather than have It sink in the estu
ary. I have communicated with Coroner
Mehrmann and it is very probable that
an autopsy will be ordered to determine
the cause of death. I am of the opinion
that the body was In the water about
three days."

MUSIC LOVERS
WERE BUNKOED
Subscribers to Grand
Opera Season Are
Disgusted.
Methods of Manager Grau
Meet With Severe
Criticism.
Now that the grand opera season has
come to a close the p?ople of San Fran
cisco, who 'contributed so largely to its
financial fuccos*. arc â¢wondering: Jf they
have not been bunkoed. They have heard
much concerning fake prizefights, and
have repeatedly expressed their indigna
tion thereat, but when bunkoism is con
rsreted with art at $7 -a 'seat for the privi
lege of hearing prima donnas who be
came suddenly and mysteriously 111 at the
croda] hour, then lovers of music re
rignedly say to themselves that they
must put up with the whims of renowned
artists whose fame has been won In the
metropolitan centers of the Old World.
When the subject of a season of grand
opera in San Francisco with such artists
as Calve. Sanderson, Gadski, Sembrich
and Eames was first broached, the lovers
of Wagner and the Italian school of
music rapturously promised their support.
Here was an opportunity to hear the
most renowned singers of the world in
standard operas, which should not be
neglected.
But what a tremendous risk for Maur
ice Grau to transport such an array of
musical talent across the continent away
from the recognized musical center.
Would the wealth and musical culture of
San Francisco come to Grau's support?
Would it pay the prices asked to hear the
greatest exponents of the art of Wagner.
Verdi and the other composers? Would
i he venture be profitable enough to war
rant Grau In sending an army of high
ralaried people to the coast? These were
the questions which were asked, and ulti
mately answered to the satisfaction of
Grau and of those interested with him in
the great venture.
Successful Sale of Seats.
When the season was under considera
tion it was decided by Grau that if suffi
cient seats could be disposed of by sub
scription for three weeks he would send
his galaxy of vocal talent to San Fran
cisco. A local agent of recognized ability
v.as engaged to work up the season's sale
f.nd his efforts wore more than success
ful. Before three days passed the greater
part of the Grand Opera-house for three
weeks was sold out at fancy prices rang
ir.g from $50 to $10) per seat. The box
sale was enormously successful, several
of the boxes bringing in as much as $SW
for the season. This substantial recogni
tion of the virtues of Grau's aggregation

Fancy Bazaar Is Held at Residence of Mrs. N. D. Ride
out=Â«Denman=Cheatham Weddings-Miss
/ Hellman Makes Debut.
MRS. N. D. HIDEOUTS beautiful
home at 1950 Washington street
was thronged yesterday after
noon with residents of this city
and vicinity. The occasion was
a bazaar given for the benefit of the Pres
byterian Orphanage at San Anselmo. The
success of the affair exceeded the expec
tations of the patronesses. Throughout
the day the residence was crowded with
society people, who purchased liberally of
the useful and beautiful things on exhibi
tion.
The various tables containing articles
of all kinds and descriptions were presid
ed aver by pretty girls tastefully gowned.
The little orphans In the home number
more than 100 and they will receive many
additional comforts through the thought
fulness of the ladles having the bazaar in
hand. Checks were received from many
quarters and when the funds are all in
many hundreds of dollars will be added to
the treasury of the charitable institution.
The kindness of Mrs. Hideout in throw
ing open her mansion to the charitable
workers was greatly appreciated. Her
servants lent their assistance and the
hostess was extremely gracious to all vis
itors. The rooms were prettily decorated
with greens, cut flowers and potted plants.

There was a meeting of the executive
and advisory committee of the George
Washington Memorial Association yes
terday morning at the Century Club. The
committee will devise ways to raise fif-
was made much of by certain of the press
which united In praising: Grau's enter
prise, and devoted columns to thÂ© free
advertising of his musical stars.
The furor in local society increased
from day to day. Everybody who pre
tended to social distinction, and many
who did not, were determined to make
this an occasion for that ostentatious
show which, as Balzac says, is so dear
to the feminine soul. The services of mo
distes were brought in requisition, for new
opera gowns and cloaks were an absolute
necessity. Those that were used at the
opera last season were out of date, and
new costumes were imperatively demand
ed. Men who could afford the expendi
ture, and many more who could not, in
vested large sums for the adornment of
their wives, who read with delight on the
following day in the newspapers complete
descriptions of their charming: costumes.
It was a social triumph for many, but the
end is not yet- The collectors for the
cloak and garment makers who do busi
ness on the installment plan will be busy
for months to come, reminding their pat
rons that while the opera season comes
but once a year they are as perennial as
the summer's sun.
Hacks Were Much." in Need.
Another item that contributed to the dis
comfiture of society spouses was the ne
cessity of hacks to and from the theater
and petite soupers at the Palace and other
noted caravansaries. It was necessary for
the social standing of many that their
names should appear in the papers as
being one of a distinguished party which
discussed an elegant collation at some
bonton restaurant or other. All this sort
of thing costs money, and, added to the
price of opera seats, enough wealth was
disbursed in this sort of polite dissipation
to keep many of the participants busy for
the next six months in an endeavor to
even up scores." It is estimated that fully
$25,000 was expended for hack rides and
fancy menus during the pendency of the
season. While this may have benefited
the industries mentioned, there are many
who will look at a hack and an epicurean
menu with positive loathing lor some
months to come.
Finally came Grau and his troupe of
world beaters. They opened up business
at the Grand Opera-house in brilliant
style. It was a triumph of art and San
Francisco went wild. Calve was to ap
pear, but instead came the sudden an
nouncement that the greatest of Carmens
was illâ positively ill. This was the first
disappointment. Then followed the state
ment that Sybil Sanderson, the California
songstress whom everybody was desirous
of seeing, had partaken of poisoned meats
and was unable to meet her engagement
as scheduled. She finally recovered and
on her appearance as Mauon people won
dered what she was doing in grand opera.
Then came Calve to win a veritable tri
umph in a single performance during the
subscription season of three weeks.
Wanted More of Calve.
For the remainder of tha season thÂ©
subscribers were forced to content them
selves with Gadski, Sembrlch and Eames,
all artistes of merit, but who alone would'
scarcely have enlisted the support of San
Francisco music lovers to the tune of
nearly $200,000 for three weeks of grand
opera. The subscribers wanted more of
Calve, but the failure of Grau to gratify
them in this respect aroused that spirit
of resentment which was to grow to posi
tive hatred before the end of the season.
During the last week of the season the
subscribers were treated to four repeti-
THE SAN- FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY,- DECEMBER 8, 1901;
teen thousand dollars to be devoted to
the erection of a George Washington Me
morial Institution in the nation's capital.
The building is to be a memorial to the
father of his country. It is to be devoted
to such uses as shall carry into effect
that object and purpose which the flrsl
President so earnestly desired- for, the
American people and which he endeav
ored to secure by a bequest in his last
will and testament.
The George Washington Memorial As
sociation has been instituted and organ
ized throughout the country to take up
and accomplish the great work of estab
lishing the foundation of tho National
University of the United States. This
national institution is not intended to be
a university for fundamental education,
but for original research, and all the de
partments, bureaus and scientific insti
tutions at Washington will be at the dis
position of the students, under reasonable
regulations, to facilitate this investiga
tion. It will have such relation to other
universities as the Berlin University has
to those of Germany.
California is expected to send $15,000 to
the central organization. The members
of tho organization in this city have
taken the matter in hand and expect to
raise the requisite sum in short order. A
number of subscriptions amounting s to
55500 have been received.
At the meeting yesterday it was decided
to give a grand colonial ball on the even
ing of Washington's birthday. Tickets
will be placed at a high figure and the
event will be a society one. The ball will
either be held at the Mark Hopkins Art
Institute or at the Grand Opera-house.
If held in tho theater a platform will bo
built over the chairs and the boxes sold
for very high prices. The advisory com
mittee is composed of the following well
known society people of this city:
Mrs. Eleanor Martin, Mrs. CharlC3 W. Slack,

The International Dall Show that has
tlons, a delight they had not bargained
for. In addition to this the management
announced that "Tristan and Isolde"
would bo produced during the supple
mental season of four days. â¢ Efforts were
made by .the subscribers to have th's
ultimatum changed and "Figaro"- substi
tuted, but without success. The "Meis
tersinger" was given instead, as was a
series of Wagner operas which General
Shatter .said he liked because he could
fall asleep at any time during the per
formance and on waking find that the
thread of the musical narrative was not
disturbed. To most of the subscribers
Wagner's wild muslp was an infliction
which was borne at any old price simply
because society was there and pretended
not only to understand but to enjoy the
jargon of bachannalian sounds. Grau
wns appealed to in vain to provide enter
tainment, with a little less of that inde
finable soul which the Wagncrltes declare
characterizes the work of their master
i^mim 11 has . tne effe Â°t of stunning the
sensibilities of those poor, uneducated
people to whom Wagnerian strains are
an affliction rather than pleasure.
. Grau's Bisk Was Not Great.
It now transpires that the risk taken by
Grau in bringing his stars here was not
of the magnitude claimed for it by his
enterprising press agent. It appears that
the Grau Grand Opera Company ia a
stock concern, with a capital of $250,000 of
which Grau owns fifty shares, and a num
ber of capitalists, including John W.
Mackey and others, the remaining fifty
shares. The company has a lease of the
Metropolitan Opera-house in New York
and It is its custom to send a company Â«m
tour every year. It is a business proposi
tion which pays well to its promoters.
Grau is manager, and in addition to his
interest in the profits as a share holder Is
allowed a salary of $25,000 a year and a
percentage of the receipts. Grau has
made the discovery that the music loving
people of San Francisco will pax almost
any price for something: which has a
metropolitan reputation and he is in the
business of supplying just what is de
manded.
But in order that he may be absolutely
on the safe side, he works the subscrip
tion Bcheme for all it is worth. Then,
assured against financial loss, he trusts
to luck to carry out his part of the agree
ment. Jf one of his stars becomes ill or
her voice cracks by reason of some slight
bronchial trouble, he merely makes his
excuses, shrugs his shoulders and ex
presses the hope that his prima donna
will soon get well. Tho subscribers' to
the season just closed were led to believe
that they would have several glimpses of
Calve and the rest of the show, but at
the last they were Informed by circular
that they might have their choice of seats
for the supplemental season of four days
by paying anything from $2 to $5 a seat.
During these few days Calve appeared
three times to packed houses. There was
method in this, for Calve drew $10,000 at
each performance and on each appear
ance she was paid $2500.
Subscribers Bef used to Pay.
About 75 per cent of the subscribers re
fused to pay the additional Bum demand
ed by the management for the privilege
of seeing Calve during the supplemental
season, and many vowed they would
never again subscribe for anything, to
which the name of Grau is attached.
It is quite likely that the music loving
folk of San Francisco will remember
the shoulder-shrugging indifference with
which Grau met all their requests after
he had their money safely stowed away.
The astuteness displayed by him in add
ing a supplemental season at which his
great stars appeared at reduced prices,
while his inferior vocalists were given
carto blanche at phenomenal figures for
a season of three weeks, may have re
sulted In increasing his bank account, but
it did not endear him tho more to the
class to which he must of necessity cater
when he brings hla aggregation of vocal
ists to San Francisco again. â¢â  That class
has set the seal of its disapprobation
upon such mountebank . methods, and if
Grau's next season here is a "frost" he
will have nona but himself to thank for
such a result. , .
That the Grau company has not treated
the San Francisco public with fairness in
the matter of charges for Beats is illus
trated by the advertisements now appear
ing in the Kansas City papers. Tho com
pany is to open in "Carmen" at the Con
vention Hall to-morrow night and the
prices for seats range from $1 to $3,: ac
cording to location. While it Is true that
the expense of transportation of a large
company to San Francisco is necessarily
large, still that does not justify a doub
ling of prices to hear singers who are con
tent to take what they can get elsewhere.
If Kansas City people, pay $3 to hear
Grau's stars, there, is no Justifica
tion for tho charge of $7 for the same
privilege In San Francisco. , This is an
other bill in the indictment against Grau,
and when he appeals to San l?*ranci scans
in the future he may learn to his cost that
he cannot twice fool the people here to his
own profit.- > .. .- . .

Secretary of Commission
Speaks of New
Conditions.
Natives Are Assimilating
American Customs
Rapidly.
Daniel R. Williams! secretary of the
Philippine Commission^ and who has just
returned from Washington, where he de
livered the first report of the commission,
ia at present staying with friends in Oak
land. He will leave on the next transport
to resume his duties in Manila.
Mr. Williams thinks that in time the
islands will become thoroughly American
ized. Speaking about the situation there
he said:
I regard the present situation In the Philip
pines as most hopeful. It was my good furtune
to visit over thirty-four provinces of the archi
pelago on the tour made by the commission
when organizing provincial governments. We
everywhere met the most cordial reception and
there can be no question that the people
are anxious lor peace and for the civil liber
ties and protection which the lav/s of the com
mission hold out to them. It is natural, of
course, that five years of war should leave
much of disorder and lawlessness, as was the
case in adr own border States after the Civil
War. In addition to the sufferings caused by
war over 75 per cent of the carabaosâ the
draught animals of the islandsâ have died of
rinderpest, while swarms of locusts have de
stroyed the rice crops in many provinces. In
thirty out of the thirty-three provinces or
ganized by the commission, however, quiet
prevails and the people are once more taking
up their usual avocations. In five provinces
only â Batangas, Samar, Cebu, Bohol and La
gunaâis there now any military activity.
When it Is considered that scarcely three years
have passed since the American occupation of
the islands, and but little more than two since
the outbreak of the insurrection, the showing
made" is certainly not discouraging.
Demand for American Schools.
In our tour through the provinces the first
request of the people was for public schools
and American teachers. They Imitate readily
and arc good linguists. It can safely be pre
dicted that within ten or fifteen years English
will be the prevailing language of the archi
pelago. With a common language many of the
misunderstandings which now necessarily arise
will disappear. The commission has had a big
task on its hands. It has had to construct a
government from the ground up, for the Span
iards bequeathed little that was of value either
in lav/s or morals. Some estimate of the
amount of work Â«fione may bj gathered from
the fact that In thirteen months something
over 283 laws have been passed. Every branch
and department ; of the Government has had
to be reorganized and started anew. The
promulgation of this legislation has had an Im
mense influence in bringing about a better un
derstanding between Americans and Filipinos.
Accustomed to being deluded, our professions
of good laith and upright intentions toward
them were regarded with such doubt and sus
picion that nothing less than a practical object
lesson would gain their confidence. This they
have received and are receiving. A municipal
code has been adopted under which the gov
ernment of the municipalities is practically au
tonomous. A act has been drawn
under which the Governor of the province is
elected by the Councilors of the municipalities.
> Public Moneys Spent by People.
All taxes collected from the people are spent
by them for their own purposes and In the
province and town where collected. The bal
ance of power is still held, however, by Ameri
cans. The courts have been reorganized. Judges
appointed and the whole machinery of Justice
put in motion along modern lines. In every
department the quickening and cleansing in
fluence of Anglo-Saxon ideas Is apparent. The
i Filipino Is quick to see where his own Inter
ests are concerned, and while the pace set may
be somewhat rapid for him at this time his
power of Imitation, his quickness and his de
sire to excel will Insure constant progress. It
may be slow work, but it is not hopeless work-
Mr. Williams was formerly connected
with the law office of Bishop, Wheeler &
Hoefler. . â¢ He went to the islands as secre
tary of Professor Bernard Moses, and
about' six months ago was promoted to
his present position. .
â  -" â  â¢
families were present and took part in the
festivities.
Promptly at 9 o'clock the strains of a
wedding march were heard. The beauti
ful bride was prettily gowned and was
escorted by her father to her place be
neath a huge floral wedding bell. She was
met by the groom and his best man, Wil
liam Denman, the bride's brother. Miss
Norma Preston was maid of honor and
the bridesmaids were Miss Medora
Cheatham and Miss Alice Cheatham 61
Tennessee, sisters of the groom. Kather
ine Redding was flower girl and Kenneth
Monteagle ring bearer.
The ushers were Thomas Ransome, Dix
well Davenport. Dr. Morton Gibbons. Fer
dinand Stephenson, "Worthington Ames
and Percy King.
Colonel Cheatham is a son of the lato
Lieutenant General Cheatham of the Con
federate army. Colonel, Cheatham has
served with distinction in the United
States army and is now on leave of ab
sence from his arduous duties in the Phil
ippines. The bride was a society belle and
extremely popular. They will, depart to
day on their honeymoon. The gifts re
ceived by the couple are handsome and
elaborate.
Miss Mabel Toy entertained seventy-five
lady friends at a euchre party at the So
roeis Club yesterday afternoon. The in
terior was tastefully decorated and the
young lady made an excellent hostess.
Miss Flora Hellman, the charming
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. I. W. Hellman.
made her debut Into society last evening
at a dinner party given at her parents'
home, corner of Franklin and Sacramento
streets. The gathering was a large one
and a delightful evening was spent by the
many guests.

gravings, and every page is brimful of In-
tensely interesting and practical informa-
tion. It is a book which should be In every
home. It is by far the most remarkable
work of the kind that has ever been writ-
ten, and it has truly created a sensation
in the book world
It tells you how a wonderful woman In
England got millions of dollars simply by
the exercise of her marvelous hypnotic
powers over the lords and millionaires or
her country. It explains numerous in-
stances in which people have been secret-
ly and instantaneously controlled by hyp-
notic influence. It teaches you how to pro-
tect yourselves from the use of hypnotic
power over you. It tells you how to de-
velop and use your magnetic power so as

and have used them in their business to
pile up millions. This book lays bare se-
crets in the lives of rich men of which
you have never dreamed. It reveals all
the hidden mysteries of personal magnet-
ism, hypnotism, magnetic healing, etc.,
and discloses the real source of power and
influence in every walk of life. It contains
secret information of inestimable value to
every person who wants to succeed in life.
Many of the most prominent public men
in this country have obtained this book
and read every line, and they are daily
using its teachings to their own profit and
gain.
It explains to you the power by which,
you may cure yourself and others of all
diseases and bad habits without the aid
of drugs or medicines. It tells of a secret,
instantaneous method by which you may
produce a state of insensibility to pain in
any parts of the body, so that the teeth
may be extracted and surgical operations
performed without the use of cocaine,
ether or anaesthetics of any kind. It gives
you the power to induce sleep in yourself
or others at any time of the day or night
you may desire. It enables you to develop
your mental .faculties, improve your mem-
ory, eradicate disagreeable tempers and
habits in children, and to develop within
yourself a marvelous magnetic will power
so ptronc: and so subtle as to make you
practically irresistible. It will give you
a force of character of which you have
little dreamed, and will truly make you a
leader of men. No matter how strong this
description may seem, it is not one-half
as ctronsr as the marvelous power ex-
plained in this wonderful work.

The following extracts from a few of
the letters received from some of thÂ© peo-
ple who have read the book give an Idea
of its unusual character and great value:
Mrs. Mary Milner, 312 D street. Pueblo.
Colo., In a recent letter says: "I was so
sick and worried I could not eat or sleep.
I wrote you for your free book. I used the
methods on myself with wonderful suc-
cess. To-day I am perfectly well. I would
not part with the information you r*ve
me for any money."
Mr. T. L. Undenstruth, SO East South
street. Wilkesbarre, Pa., says:. "Your
work on personal magnetism Is a fortune
to any one starting in life. It Is absolute-
ly sure to bring success."
A. J. McGinnis. 60 Ohio street, Alleghe-
ny, Pa., says: "When I wrote for your
book I was laboring by the day. Now I
am managing a business. This 13 certain-
ly the best proof that could be offered of
its great value. I advise every man who
wishes to succeed in life to get a copy at
once."
G. S. Lincoln. M. D.. 101 Crutchfield
street. Dallas. Texas, writes: "Your meth-
ods of personal influence are marvelous, t
have used them on my patients with won-
derful results. They cure diseases , when
medicine and every thing else fail."
S.. R. King, M. D.. Glllam. Ind.. writes:
"You have sent me the most remarkable (
book I have truly ever read. By the meth-
ods explained in your work headache, back- {
ache, rheumatism and. other diseases of
long standing disappear like magic. Your
instruction in personal magnetism is sim-
ply grand. It gives one a power and an
Influence over others which I did not
dream it was possible for the average man
to acquire. Your book Is worth more than
gold to any one starting In life. Its value
cannot be estimated. My only regret is
that it was not in my hands when I was a
young man."

Little Tryphina Entertains.
That bright little 12-year-old Companion
of the Forest. A. O. F.. Trypnina Pritch
axd, the pet of Loyal Circle and In fact
cf nil members of the order, on the night
of the 4th lnst. gave an entertainment for
the enjoyment of the members of the
circle named. 6he arranged the pro
gramme, secured the talent and during
the evening acted as mistress of cere
monies and discharged the duties of that
position without the least embarrassment
and in a manner that surpassed the ef
forts of many older in years and experi
ence. "With one exception her talent was
all juveniles and the features of the pro
gramme were a fancy dance by Miss
Martha Davis, recitation by Miss Frances
Brown, violin solo, Miss Gladys Couth, and
recitations by Little Tryphina. She gave
"The Polish Boy," a place that required
feeling and dramatic poses to render it
properly, with all the force and effect that
was Intended by the writer, her voice be
ing strong and clear in passages and
modulating to tho soft yet distinct in pa
thetic passages. She was loudly ap
plauded and as an encore gave "Joshua
and the Mouse." demonstrating her abil
ity to do as well in the comic line as in the
highly dramatic. Her mother, Mrs.
Pritchard. entertained with the rendering
cf \wo dialect selections. A -programme
of dancing followed the entertainment.

OIL SUPPLANTS
COAL AS FUEL
Many Big Local Con

fornia Petroleum.
Outlook for Growth of New
Industry Decidedly
Encouraging.
â  i
In a list Just complied by Secretary C.
T. Deane of tho California Petroleum
Miners' Association the firms and com
panies that are burning California petro
leum for fuel in this city are named. If
there were no other literature relating: to
the oil Industry at this time, this Hat
would show to what extent coal la being
superseded for the making of power in San
Francisco. Incidentally the Indorsement
of these many responsible concerns sup
plies an excellent guarantee for the
growth and permanency of the industry
when tho obstacles -that are due to a
greater supply than demand and the de
moralization in prices caused by haste to
market at any rates for ready money are
overcome.
In Secretary Deane'a list are all the
San Francisco parties who have been
granted permission between May 22, 1899,
and November 18, 1301, to handle oil fuel
In this city. Railway companies, manu
facturing plants and many leading enter
prises not before mentioned axe now us
ing oil fuel in preference to coal. Cheap
ness and convenience and neatness are
the incentives for making the change in
the fuel used. The complete list la as
follows:

This makes a very good showing for
two years, the period since the first per
mit to use oil fuel in this city was grant
ed, for there are represented 126 ; of the
leading enterprises of San Francisco,
practically all the street railways and ell
the great manufacturing plants, with
many of less size. When oil reaches th9
price of $1 per barrel delivered, it will
still be cheaper than coal and will hold
Its own as a fuel, while it will give the
stockholders In the oil companies some
dividends on their investments.
The Mining and Engineering Review
say3 that there are 'only two Texas oil
companies whose stock is above par but
there are thirteen in California.
â According to the Bakersfield Callfor
nian, the shipments from the Kern Coun
ty fields in November amounted to 23C4
carloads.
I#os Angeles Is Overstocked.
The Los Angeles Express says: *
What to do with the oil is now the problem
that faces the oil producers ' of Los Angeles.
The pumps have been kept going and wells
have been deepened until to-day there is a
surplus In production over consumption of SO -
000 barrels a month, and there are thirty-flvp.
rigs at work deepening wells in the local field
Charles Victor Hall has over 10.000 barrels of
oil stored In the field, the utornge company haÂ«s
its tanks filled with thÂ« surplus, and the oil
continues to flow out of the ground as If the
market was short instead of overstocked. The
storage company can store 175,000 barrels in
its tanks and the total amount on hand over
and above what is needed to fill contracts is
to>-day nearly 150,000 barrels. The price has
tumbled until all the contracts have been filled
and the producers now face twelve months of
price cutting and Inactivity unless something
Is done on Â»oma of thÂ« many refinery schemes
on foot. Nearly every clique of oil men In tho
field has a refinery scheme on foot. There are
no less than six new refining companies being
organized and from one extreme to the other
the oil men are at their wits' end to find a
hole to crawl out of. v
The Bakersfield Californian reports that
there is a probability that the pipe line
for the Sunset district will be begun early
next year.
The Kern County Courthouse Is now
heated with oil.
The Government returns of. exports
shows that the quantity of American pe
troleum that was sent abroad in October
was 89,476,865 gallons, a decrease of 3 712 -
196 gallons as compared with the expor
tation In October, 1900. For ten months
of the present year, as compared with
tlie corresponding period last year the
showing is a gain in exportation of illum
inating oils amounting to 56,594,439 gal
lons. The total exportation of the illumi
nating oils for the first ten months of
this year waa 616.011.167 gallons. The ex
portation of crude petroleum fell off to
the extent of about 12,000,000 gallons in
ten months.

MISCELLANEOUS.
THE LIVE MUSKOX.
Will be exhibited to-day on the east side
of Stanyan street, between Halght and
Page streets, opposite entrance of Golden
Gate Park. It can also be seen Sunday
evening and Monday and Tuesday at 427
Bush street, opposite the California Hotel.
This muskox is the only one ever seen
outside of the Arctic regions. It is con-
sidered a rare curiosity because none of
its species has ever been captured before.
This animal is not far from.18 months old
and weighs about 800 pounds. It was cap-
tured Jn March of this year somewhere
on the barren lands east of Lyngton Bay,
a branch of Lady Franklin Bay. some 700
miles northeast of the Mackenzie River,
taken by a party of Esquimaux Indians.
The animal now is completely tame and
is more docile than an ordinary domestic
cow. though it is much larger for its age
and looks ferocious.*.' The Indians at this
time killed eighteen full grown animals,
which included the males and females.
Three of last year's calves were captured
by them, one being badly wounded, and
the other two not being harmed. The
one that was wounded died of Its injuries
and the mate to this one was killed, by
the Indian dogs at HerscheMslands. /
The great value attached to thlB animal
is that it inhabits a portion of the earth
which has never yet been visited by hu-
man beings. In air the records of the ex-
plorers, Nansen, Perry and others, who
have visited those northern regions In
search of the north pole, each day their
logbook r notes what they have seen and
found in the most extreme northern re-
gions, and the muskox at all times la; en-
tered in a prominent place in those rec-
ords, which shows that, as far as we
know, the muskox inhabits all the coun-
try In the circle bounded by the north
pole. If there is land at the north pole,
there is no. doubt that this animal lives
there also.
Owing to the extreme difficulty in. reach-
ing these lands, no live specimen is to be
found on the face of the earth from those
regions, except the muskox which is now
on exhibition. Considering this and tho
fact that actually there is not, -nor ever
has been, an animal captured_and brought
from those regions before, this animal Is
a rare curiosity which all should see.- .
. In addition to this, there is also on ex-
hibition. at 427 Bush street some rare' and
â¢ valuable curiosities'. from the. Arctic re-
gions which are possessed of great inter-
est. The price of admission- Is a very
popular one, namely. 10 cents. As stated
above, -the muskox will be on; exhibition
to-day at the entrance of. Golden Gate
Park and. later at 427 Bush street. C. D.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market
NEW YORK. Dec. ".âSpeculators of stocks
rushed to sell to-day and precipitated a vio
lent decline which carried prices below last
Katurfiay'e level, leaving no vestige of the
week's gains. Amalgamated Copper led the
van with Manhattan a close second. The cop
per etock touched G4"Â£, a loss from last night
cf 3Â»fc. The scramble to cover among the shorts
reduced the net loss to S l A. In Manhattan the
extreme decline was 1% and the net loss only
\i. On the first break In the market many
railroad stocks and the Steel stocks were little
effected and they resisted the decline stoutly.
On the second break, after the appearance cf
the bank statement, the weakness became very
ireaeral at declines of 1@5 points. New York
Central. Great Northern preferred, St- Paul.
Rock Island, Chicago and Northwestern nnd
General Electric were weak. The bank state
tnmnt was even weaker than expected. The
loss in cash reserves reached over seven mil
lions and an expansion of over five millions
in the loan* stretched the legal reserve require
ment so that the surplus waa cut in half and
brought to $7,000,000. Heavy losses In Amal
gamated CoppÂ«T necessitated sacrifice* in other
Mocks. It was manifest that recent pool sup
jwrt In various etocloi had been withdrawn, the
I insiders having presumably taken their profits
I on the week's rise. The transfer of funds for
speculation to the rraln and cotton markets
Impinges on the eupply available for the stock
market. liquidation for account of unimport
ant firms about to retire Is believed to figure
largely In selling. The closing: was feverish,
but ellgtotly better than the worst.
There have been periods of general etrengtb â¢
In the etock market this week and points of
continuous strength, but the spirit of doubt
has been sufficiently obvious. The operations
were by professionals, sometimes combined
into Etrong pools and by banking Interests and
large capitalists. The commission houses re
port that there is no evidence that the general
public, which makes the really good periods of
Fpeculation, has taken any interest In the
market This is accounted for In part, no
doubt, by the large diversion of interest to the
cereal markets, in which a rampant specula
tion nas raged during the week.
The President's message was a favorable In
fluence In ths stock market, especially because
the bears had sold the market In anticipation
of an extremely hostile attitude on the part
or the Chief Magistrate against the great com
binations of capital. The buying by the bears
to cover after the contents of the message be
came known argued that the document did net
meet their expectations In that regard. The
list of stocks which advanced during the week
is rather conspicuous, nevertheless, by the ab
seno*' of thopr concerned, directly or indirectly,
in the formation of the Northern Securities
Comi-any and of such stocks as the United
Mates Steel Corporation and Amalgamated
Copper. The copper security has had Us own
srHH>lÂ«l considerations to contend with. The
discujsicn of the progress tnaktr.R In the plan
Involved in the formation of the Northern
Securities Company has been without any fur
ther information on the subject of who is con
cerned. The meeting of Western representa
tives called to discuss the new conditions and
to further the community of Interests wm with
out the attendance of the most prominent of
the executives expected, and the Information
was given out that It was considered wise to
hold the discussion in abeyance. A number
I of directory changes in the railroads con
cerned in the Northern Securities Company
1 were explained as due to a purpose to avoid
questions. It is feared also that the money
outlook to the end of the year Is not altogether
clear owing to the international situation. Less
Fold went out than was expected, but further
requirements are to be met apparently. Con
ditions ore more Improved trom Uie worst in
Germany, and the Berlin money market has
| been easy, but the year-end requirements are
J very many. Money scarcity is expected in
London to the end of the year. Paris has re
newed the buying of discounts in London, but
money rates have advanced again In Paris and
sterling at Paris has declined. The prospect
of further gold exports from New York Is not
viewed with equanimity by speculators es
pecially on account of the continued depletion
of the bank reserve here on domestic account.
Againet these factors admonishing to precau
tion is the indubitable fact that the country's
business and industries are still on the upward
trend. Bank clearings for November were iii
excess of any previous November In the coun
try's history, and it is notable that the ratio
of increase Is largest outside the._jrreat specu
lative centers. Railroad earnings continue to
show increases over those of last year, though
in a somewhat diminished ratio. The earlier .
fears of wide inroads upon railroad earnings
on account of the shortage in the corn crop
are giving way to a conviction that the gen
eral merchandise movement Is more than suf
ficient to offset tills, as it did the spring wheat
shortage last year In the Northwest. Com
platnts of insufficient car supply to carry the
freight offered come from all parts of the coun
try, and railroads are increasing their supply
of equipment and making improvements to In
crease their carrying capacity. There is ap
parent confidence '.in the continuance of de
mands tipon their* reserves. The present ac
tivity of the iron trade and the demand for
future requirements continue to break all rec
ords. General trade in all lines is reported
active and prosperous. The contrast with the
commercial and Industrial depression reported
in foreign countries Is striking. Increasing at
tention is given to the course of our foreign
trade, which reflects the depression abroad.
The question in asked whether this condition
of the outside world can fail to find an ulti
mate reflection upon our own conditions. Our
iron and steel exports have fallen on* $23,C00 COO
or 2L5 per cent, in ten month3 of 190L com
pared' with the corresponding period of 1300
In copper the decrease hae been $23,000,000 also
but the percentage is 45.5. It is claimed that
the domestic requirements of the iron and steel
industry are fo large that none can be spared
for export. The upset caused in the copper
trade by the decline in the export demand is.
however, very obvious, notwithstanding the
confusion and obscurity of the present condi
tion in that trade. The decrease in exports.
Â»s most marked in the two commodities named,
but th? declining tendency of the country's for
; eirn trade Is dear. It Is a patent fact that
while enormous proprei=s has been made In the
wide distribution of capitalization of financial
combinations, some of the most Important part
of it is still in the hands of the syndicates and
capitalists who projected it.
There has been a good demand for railroads
this week, mostly of the speculative and semi
sppculativp olafs.
The United States refunding 2s advanced %
and the 3s registered % per cent over the call
cf last we.elt.
j The sales of bonds were $2,978,000.

Associated Banks' Statement':
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.â The statement of the
Associated Banks for the week ending to-day
shows :
Loans, $881,552,000: increase, $5,332,000.
Deposits, $938,558,100; decrease, $1,71,0,400.
Circulation. {31,986,400; increase, $11,400.
Legal tenders. $71,816,500; decrease, $578,700.
Specie, $163,530,700; decrease, $6,655,500.
Reserves, J2U.247.200; decrease, $7,234,500.
Reserves required, $234,789,235; decrease
$427,600.
Surplus. $6,607,675: decrease. $6,806,900.
The Financier says: It is to be observed
that the decline from the br.nks into the Treas
ury last week was largely due to the excep
tional movement of a retirement of circulation
by interior institutions and also that there can
be no smaller retirement of notes at least until
January, the law limiting such operations to
$3,000,000 per month. The movement of the
money through transfers to the Interior watf
likewise exceptional. The estimate by the De
partment of Agriculture of a smaller crop of
cotton than had been exoected caused a bull
speculation in the staple, thus increasing the
requirements for money to carry the latter In
store and to move it from plantations. The
transfers to Chicago, which were notably large
at the end of the week, were mainly, due to the
speculation in grain at the Western centers.
It Is probable that these Fneculative move
ments In cotton and in grain will spon sub
side, and hence It seeirs likely that not much
additional money will be needed from this
center for such pun>O6es. The forelen ex
change market probably will be afTected this
week by the active money which will be ex
pected to result from the low bank reserves,
hence cold shipments to Europe may be held
In check unless. Indeed, there should be urg
ency In the demand for th<Â» metal for export.
Considering the facts noted, ths bank state
ment may be regarded as of such a character
I as not to excite apprehensions of prolonged ac
i tivity in money as the result of low bank re
' serves. Should higher rates for loana prevail.
I however, such rates will of themselves tend to
attract money from Eastern and near-bv
points, thus relieving any undue stringency in
the situation.
London Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Bay3'
The stock market to-day was idle and heavy,

American shares. London is aoathetic, but
takes a bloomy view of the monetary outlook
in New York. Copper shares as well aa Ameri
can stocks dwindled throughout, Rio Tlntos
declining to 41%.
The recent issue of Â£1,000,000 National Tele
phone preferred has been underwritten by the
Morgans and it Is reported that that house has
placed 50 per cent of the iFBue.
November trade returns Fhow a decrease In

a flood of it poured in from several sources.

Richmond the Chicago of California.
Three things have made Chicago a great
city.
Its central location, its position at the i head
of navigation and Its railroad system.
Richmond enjoys these advantages already,
-and very soon it will enjoy the manufactur-
ing business of the coast. It will enjoy the
; deepest water vessels . that travel from the
Orient and European waters.
The Ban Francisoo Call In a recent editorial
says the' development of , Point â¢ Richmond
"means that this city (San Francisco) will
â  transact its whole business along the whole
. eastern shore of . the bay, and that Its great-
est concentration â  and best development will
be where ship and car can come together."

torials could be produced from the leading
- papers of the State upon . the same , strain as
Just quoted. ' Remember, purchaser, we of-
fer you â - Vms opportunity. â¢ Will you avail

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1901.
DAMAGED BY TYPHOON'S FORCE
SHERIDAN ARRIVES IN PORT
Consumes Nearly Two Months in Getting Here From
Manila, but Beats Nagasaki Record.
THE United States army transport
Sheridan arrived from thÂ« Philip
pines, via Japanese ports, yester
day. She now holds the record
for the longest run from Manila
anil the fastest run from Nagasaki, Ja
par, of any of the twin-screw fleet In Un
cle Sam's service. She was fifty-eight
days on her way here from Manila, but
came from the Japanese coast in seven
teen days and six hours, which Is a splen
did performance.
Boon after leaving Manila the Sheridai
ran Into a typhopn, and during It the ma
chinery was disabled. The vessel was
hove to for a time and repairs made and
then the transport was able to reach Na
gasaki on October 10. Once on the Japan
ese coast her passengers began to desert
her. and many of them came home on the
M&il steamers and some on the Hancock.
Captain Pierce of the Sheridan cabled
â Washington that the repairs on his ship
would take some time, and as the Con
gressional party was aboard the Govern
ment, rushed the "Warren to the scone. All
hands were taken aboard the latter ves
sel and she made a start fpr San Fran
cisco, only to come to grief in the Inland
Set 1 ..
Then the Hancock was called upon and
rhe also went ashore, but without injury
to the hull, "so she went along, alter get
ting oft the beach. Later the passengers
of the Sheridan and the Warren were
taken aboard. They reached San Francisco
Beveral days ago. :
Nevertheless the &heridan . picked up
1600 passengers while she was detained at
Nagasaki. Those who came up in the,
cabin were:
Colonel Tully McCrea, Artillery Corps; Mrs.
Tully McCrea, Lieutenant Colonel M. C. Foote,
Ninth Infantry; Major L. W. Cooke, Twenty

The short' term men, of "whom there
were 1499 aboard, were at once transferred
to the detention camp at Angel Island.
They will be held there until their papers
arc made out and will then be sent home.
H. H. Tassler, a discharged soldier, was
in trouble on the vessel. He was a cor
poral in the Signal Corps and overstayed
his leave at Nagasaki. Being a dischaged
man it seems hard to understand how he
could overstay his leave. Anyhow Colonel
McCrea ordered him put In Irons and then
the other discharged men nearly mutinied.
There were catcalls when an officer put
in an appearance, and when he tried to
discipline a discharged man uncompli
mentary remarks were hurled at him.
"I'm not a soldier. I'm a citizen of the
United States and as good as you any
day,' one of the men exclaimed.
Finally Tassler broke out of jail and de
fled rearrest. "If the crew, of the ship
will arrest me," said he, "well and good,
but the military authorities have no con
trol over me." Then Colonel McCrea ap
pealed to Captain Pierce, and when the
fifth officer and two sailors cajne along
Tassler went quietly into the brig. .
This was on December 3 and the pris
oner was only released when the Sheridan
was making port. Every discharged man
on the vessel contributed money to help
Tassler carry his case to Washington.
Among the arrivals on the Sheridan was
Lieutenant Hazard of the First Cavalry,
who assisted in the capture of Agulnaldo.
He subsequently entered a Filipino camp
and captured Howard, a deserter from
the First California. For his services he
has been recommended for a special
medal by the commanding general and
also for promotion.
The Sheridan came to the dock late in
the afternoon and will sail again for the
Philippines almost immediately.

The Pacific Steam Navigation Compa
ny's liner Chili was a little late in getting

Chinese Is Badly Injured.
Muey Bon was brought from the ferries
yesterday to the Harbor Hospital with a
fractured skull. He was found in the
depot and no one knew what : was the
matter with him. At the hospital an ex
amination was made of his papers and
they showed that he was In transit from
Mexico to China. The doctors at the hos
pital therefore came to the conclusion
that he had eluded his guard and jumped
from the moving train, and as the effects
of the fracture did not show themselves
for several hours he was able to reach
the. steamer and get as far as San Fran
cisco. Muey Bon is not likely to recover,
but if he does he. will, go back to China. .

TARIFF RATES
FOR PHILIPPINES
Ways and Means Com
mitteemen of House
Not in Accord.
Another Important Question
Is Whether Goods Can Be
Carried in Foreign Ships.
'CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â There is a
division of opinion among the Republican
members of the "Ways and Means Com
mittee of the House over the question of
Philippine tariff. Some favor quick ac
tion on some measure like the Lodge bill
that will extend the Dingley rates to im
ports into this country from the Philip
pines and establish the duties of the Taf t
commission upon all imports into the
Philippines.
Others think that such a law should
have a definite limit, expiring: In a given
time, and that meanwhile It should bo
understood that a permanent law would
be in preparation, a result of careful and
economic Investigation, to go into effect
at a stated time.
The question will be determined by
Monday or Tuesday, and after that data
it is expected there will be prompt action
In the committee and the House on the
tariff bill.
Whether goods must be shipped ex
clusively In American vessels between
the United States and the Philippines is
a question the Treasury Department will
not decide until some definite case arises.
Treasury officials say that it would be a
misfortune should It be found necessary
to decide that the coasting' trade law ap
plies to the Philippines and that It would
certainly impede the development of our
trade with the Orient, for there are not
American ships enough to do the busi
ness. . . â
