At Present Diplomacy Is Considered
Sufficient to Bring the little

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON. April 23.â Venezuela
will be made to feel the weight of Ameri
can displeasure in return for its discour
teous treatment of Minister Francis B.
Loomis.
President Castro's attitude toward the
official representative of the United
State will be resented, not forcibly but
diplomatically. The American legation In
Caracas for some months at least will
be left in the care of Mr. Russell, who
will act as charge d'affaires, and It Is
probable that the Venezuelan Government
will be Informed of the reason which
actuates the President In reducing the
Importance of American representation at
Caracas.
Castro's Imprudent Course,
The decision of the administration with
respect to Venezuela^was reached to-day
after Secretary Hay had a conference
with Minister Loomis, and at a Cabinet
meeting had communicated the explana
tion made by the diplomat to the Presi
dent and his colleagues. It was an
nounced by a high authority that Loomis
"had acted with intelligence and discre
tion in carrying out instructions given him
by the State Department." This means
that President Castro's objection to Min
ister Loomis Is not personal, but due to
the fact that the latter represents the
United States. It is not proposed to dis
patch a sauadron to Venezuela. For the
present, at least, diplomatic representa
tions are considered sufficient, and It Is
hoped they will bring President Castro
to a proper appreciation of the course to
pursue in the treatment of foreign rep
resentatives.
Loomis Is Not Indiscreet.
Minister Loomis convinced the author
ities to-day that he had not been In
discreet, and had not made statements re
flecting upon President Castro. He said
after leaving Secretary Hay that he had
had no personal disagreement with Gen
eral Castro. He declared he did not be
lieve President Castro said that the Vene
zuela authorities believed he accepted fa
fors from the asphalt trust. He declined
to answer" the question as to whether he
was persona non grata, to President Cas
tro, but It Is learned that no representa
tions regarding Loomis have been made
by Venezuela to Secretary Hay.
The Secretary gave Loomis to under
stand that he could return to Venezuela
if he desired to do so, but the Minister
asked that he be granted leave to go
abroad for the benefit of the health of his
wife and himself. He expects to be at
Carlsbad three months. Upon his return
he will determine whether he will go back
to Caracas. The expectation is that he
will be transferred to some European
post, and the diplomat whom he succeeds
will be cent to Caracas.
Other Powers Also Object.
As a result of Loomis' report It is
learned that the officials understand that
Germany and Spain, as well as the United
States, recently separately informed the
Venezuelan Government that they -would
not consent to the consideration of claims
arising out of the recent revolution in
Venezuelan courts. Great Britain is ex
pected to make similar representations.
President Castro is said to have sacked
the court which is to consider the facts
in the asphalt disputes, but the State
Department will review the decision ren
dered.
President Castro is accused of being per
sonally interested in the settlement of this
dispute, where he and his brother. It is
charged, contemplate seizing that part
of the Felicldad concession outside of that
granted to Warner and Quinlan. Repre
sentatives of the Orinoco Iron Company,
concession which was recently canceled,
are in Washington urging that the United
States insist upon the restoration of their
grant.
CHICAGO'S CHIEF OF POLICE
RESIGNS HIS POSITION
CHICAGO, April 23.â Chief of Police
Klpley handed in his resignation this
evening to Mayor Harrison. For some
time it has been evident, from statements
made by the Mayor, that he did not intend
to reappoint Chief Kipley and as the ap
pointment is to be announced next Mon
day, the chief decided this afternoon to
take matters into bis own hands.
He called upon the Mayor and asked
him in Epeclfic terms if he was wanted
for another term. The Mayor was as spe
cific as the chief and told him that hÂ© had
no Intention of reappolntlng him. The
chief then went to his office, wrote out his
resignation, 6ent it to the Mayor and,
calling up all the police stations In the
city, announced that he was no longer
Chief of Police. Mayor Harrison declined
to discuss the retirement of Klpley or give
tbe name of his successor.

The Ohio Society of California, upon
whose shoulders will devolve a great por
tion of the responsibility of successfully
entertaining President McKinley during
his visit in this city, is without exception
one of the most vigorous social organiza
tions on . the - Pacific Coast. The- society
was organized June 12, 1897, with less
than fifty members, but since then It has
met with a . remarkable growth and to
day it numbers within its ranks many of
the State's most influential citizens. The
names of many of California's ' leading
merchants, scientists and. Jurists adorn
Its roll and = President McKinley himself

The people of Marln County are making
great preparations for welcoming the
President on May 16, for on that day he
will "cross . over to Sausalito on Â¦ his way
to the top of Mount Tamalpais. He will
be met as he leaves the ferry at Sausalito
by. thousands of citizens and by the school
children of the county. There will be no
time for more than a cheer and perhaps
another when he pauses on his return,
but the people of Marln County are mak
ing ready to crowd- Into that single mo
ment all the loyalty and hospitality they
feel for the President and all he repre
sents.

of the projects which is inviting consid

quartered at the" Presidio turn - out, I but
it is very doubtful if they/will be per
mitted to ' parade for Â¦ both , the I President

- SACRAMENTO, April 23.â The prelimi
nary arrangements for . the of
President McKinley and party in this city
are progressing. The following commit
tee of citizens has been appointed to act
Jointly with the Board of Trustees and the
committee appointed by the Legislature:
Sacramento in Line.
E. O. McCormick, traffic manager of
tiie Southern Pacific Company, leaves to
day for New Orleans to meet President
incKLnley. The popular railroad man will
superintend the t transportation of the
President over the. Sou them Pacific sys
tem and will Journey on the special train
all the way from New Orleans to Port
land, Or. Â¦ Â¦
Several of the automoblllsts will go
down to San Jose on Sunday/ May 12, and
will take part in the procession in honor
of President McKinley on the following
morning, . returning In ; the afternoon.
Dr. Frank C. Bangs has made complete
arrangements for . the j reception of the
chauffeurs and the stabling of their ve
hicles, which will be elaborately deco
rated. There . is . talk of holding- automo
bile races In San Jose on the afternoon of
the 13th," but the club will take no official
share in them.
; President Rogers appointed C. C. Moore,
C. 'Wilson Frankel and P. F. Rocket t a
committee on applications for member
ship, and F. A. Hyde, Dr. Frank J. Till
man and A. E. Brooke-Ridley a committee
on contests, runs and tours. ,

cisco and H. B. Taylor of Oakland were
elected "resident" members; 'and C. W.
Dibble of Santa Clara, F. H. Holmes of
San Jose, H. J. Mohr of Mount Eden and
"W. C. Smith of Chico were elected "non
resident", members. . ._â..â¢
Market, Montgomery and other streets
will be decorated with evergreens and gar
lands. The evergreens will be placed at
The tower of the Ferry building will
be Illuminated with incandescent lights
Just as was done upon- the arrival of the
California volunteers. Very little bunting
will be used, and that only on Third
street, through which the President will
march upon his entrance Into the cityl
One new scheme will be tried in illumin
ating Market street. Instead of Incandes
cent lights, arc lights will be used, and
will be strung fifty feet apart on each side
of Market street, from the ferry to the
City Hall.
Charles R. Allen, chairman. of the com
mittee on decorations, says the committee
has completed many of its plans, and ha3
closed contracts for the illumination and
decoration of the streets of San Francisco.
.The committee has decided to resort to
electrical illumination very largely, this
having proved such a success In the past.
The problem of the school' children, and
there are 40,000 of them. Is being consid
ered by the Board of Education.' That they
will bo lined up to be reviewed by the
President Is a settled fact, but the trouble
Is to find a place to line them up, for
40,000 children' make an army by them
selves. Golden Gate Park and Van Ness
avenue are the only available places, and
one or the other will be chosen. The
school directors prefer the avenue, be
cause it Is more accessible and ' besides
there is more room for them there in
formation for review than anywhere in
the park.
The tickets for the citizens' banquet are
$20 apiece. At first sight this seems to be
a source of revenue, but when' the cost of
the dinner Itself, the best of champagne
and cigars, the decorations, the music, the
menus and a dozen other things are fig
ured out of It, it begins to look small, for
this is going to be a pearl among ban
quets and what will not be done to make
it perfect in its kind is not worth doing.
In addition to. being surrounded by all
the rooms and conveniences necessary for
the reception of a large number of guests,
the gymnasium of the club offers peculiar
opportunities for the art of the decorator.
It may be that this feature may decide the
committee In favor of the club.
The citizens* banquet Is still without a
home, but there are but two places in the
race for the honor just now. One is the
large grillroom of the Palace Hotel and
the other is the gymnasium of the Olym
pic Club. The grillroom will seat 450 peo
ple. Already there have been received by
A. A. Watklns, chairman of the banquet
committee, 330 acceptances, so it looks
very much as If. by the end of next week,
the capacity of the grillroom will be left
far behind. This will leave the Olympic
Club next in the race for favor. The gym
nasium can be made to seat 800 persons at
table, and if advantage be taken of the
boxing room opening from the gymnas
ium. 200 more can find place. There Is a
lack of culinary appliances in the club,
but they could easily be Installed for the
time, being, and President Harrison will
allow anything that the committee sees
fit to do.
PLANS for the reception of Presi
dent McKinley are tending toward
one of the grandest demonstra
tions â¢ ever given - by a. city and
State ,lo a chief executive. . The
finance committee of the Citizens'
Committee of San Francisco now has its
work systematized, and money Is coming
In freely and with many promises of more.
Sub-committees have their work well in
hand, and the outline of the local celebra
tion is beginning to loom up among the
countless schemes under consideration.

After striking the water the man swam
about 300 yards and to within fifty yards
of shore, when he was observed to throw
up his hands nnd sink. He came to the
surface several . times, but sank for the
last time before help could reach him. -
The man was evidently a sailor on the
vessel. He wore a dark shirt and had the
sleeves rolled up. Many efforts have been
made to recover the body by dragging the
bay In the vicinity, but without success.
It Is believed that rather than embark on
the coming vovage of the Albatross the
sailor determined to desert.

MARIPOSA, April 23.â The suit of John
R. Hite vs. the Madera Canaland Irri
gation Company and the Sugar Pine Com
pany as intervenor for control of ttfe
waters of Big Creek is being fought foot
by fcot. Documentary evidence from the
records of Mariposa County was intro
duced to-day by the plaintiff to establish
his ownership of the Hite Cove property.
Each document brought objections from
the defendants' counsel as not beine per
tinent to the cause of action, but all ob
jections were overruled by the court.
John R. Hite went upon the stand and
testined that he owned three-fourths of
the Hite Cove mine and machinery, and
that Charles H. Chane was the owner of
one-fourth at the time the patent was
issued on May 28. 1874.
Daniel Heaton testified that he had lived
at Hltes Cove and vicinity for upward of
twenty years; that he was familiar with
the volume of water flowing in the south
fork of the Merced River at different sea
sons of the year; that from August up to
the beginning of the three or four months'
rainy season there was not sufficient
water in the river to operate the quartz
mill to its full capacity, and only one bat
tery of five stamps could be operated. In
seasons there was not even sufficient
water to run five stamps.
The plaintiff practically closed his case
to-day. To-morrow the Madera Canal and
Irrigation Company and the Sugar Pine
Company, as intervenor, will open up
their side of the case.

DIEGO, April 23.-The steamship
Santa Rosa, arriving to-day from San

babe deserted at Redondo on the last
northern trip of the vessel. : The desertion
was apparently by the parents of the
child, who took passage on the steamship
here. The little one was only a month
old. and as tots of that age do not pay
fare no mention of them Is made on the
passenger list, and It is impossible to
trace at this end of the line who its pa
rents were. .
The steamship sailed at 5 o'clock and
the couple were seen on the deck and in
the cabin. The next morning the Santa

SEATTLE, April 23.â Nome advices
up to January SO, received here
to-day give details of the bliz
zards that prevailed along the
Notne coast on January 1 and 21.
Instead of 200 persons having perished, the
total number of deaths reported during

follows:
DR. H. S. PELTON of Oakland. Col.
DR. W. F..BAUM of Teller City.
DR. TAM of Teller City.
DANIEL ALEXANDER of Montana.
ALEXANDER STOWE of Nome.
TWO UNKNOWN MEN.
The Nome Gold-Digger of January 30
gives an account of the blizzards and
their work of death. It says:
"Dr. Pelton, one of the best known and
most esteemed young pioneers of Alaska,
was frozen on the trail on the night of
the terrible blizzard of the 1st instant,
near Solomon. Dr. Pelton's people reside
in Oakland, Cal., from which place he
came to Alaska. Â¦ He was 32 years old.
A message received from Spruce Creek,
dated January 23, says Dr. Pelton's body
was found on the trail between Spruce
Creek and Solomon. The body was
brought to Nome.
"Dan Alexander left Dexter for Nome
four weeks ago and has not been heard
of since. It Is feared that he perished In
the New Year's blizzard.
"News of another great tragedy of the
great blizzard was brought Into town by
United States Marshal McLean. It Is the
untimely end of Dr. W. F. Baum. who
perished while carrying medical assist
ance to a sick miner. Dr. Baum left
Nome on January 21. He was a native of
Mobile, Ala., and saw service in the Cu
ban war. .
"This afternoon United States Marshal
McLean brought into town the unidenti
fied remains of a man from Solomon.
Later the body, was Identified as that of

an huddled together In a maimed and
mutilated condition from v frost bite, In a
cabin on Pilgrim River, unable to 11$ down
because of the crush, and with the added
horror of starvation facing them. This
harrowing tale touched tl*e sympathies, of
every one present. Generous Individuals
and companies donated money and . food.
An appeal to the military was resolved
upon and within two hours an emergency
supply of food was flying over the trail by
moonlight, drawn by swift dogs. The next
day, however, a number of the victims ar
rived in town and told their story. Some
of them were badly frost-bitten and had
endured severe hardships. â¢â¢'-

SANTA BARBARA, April 23.â Santa
Cruz was to-day selected as the next
meeting-place of the Grand Parlor, Na
tive Sons of the Golden West, winning
"hands down" from San Francisco.
At the Arlington this evening occurred
the grand ball. The ballroom was crowd
ed, but Joy reigned among the guests. The
spacious room had been fittingly deco
rated with colors of the order.
To-morrow will be the big day of the
week. Business houses will close and most
of the town will go to the barbecue at
Canada de Veras, eighteen miles west. A
special train will leave here at 10 a. m.
In the morning will occur the grand pa

Ball at the Arlington.
At the start Santa Barbara won the toss
and elected to a knockdown field. On the
throw-in the ball was captured by Wick
enden and passed for a short run down
field. It was then catpured by Praed and
cleverly carried up fleid with fine strokes
and. placed in good position for Norton,
who made first goal for Riverside. Time,
4 minutes. â¢ 'â¢Â¦-.Â¦'
Upon the throw-in, Riverside seized the
ball and made a line run for Santa Bar
bara's goal, but goal was cleared by Ea
land and Fernald made first goal for
Santa Barbara. Total time, 13:20.
:Thtn.hard work began and the excellent
team work of the Riversides resulted in a
victory for them by a score of 4 to 9. The
last period was the most hotly contested
of all. While Santa Barbara showed fine
individual work, the superior team play
of Riverside quickly became evident. The
work of Norton of Riverside was the best
ever seen In Santa Barbara, while the
other members of his team did excellent
service. Ealand of Santa Barbara per
formed marvelously, in spite of the con
stant Interference of Norton. His strong
hitting and steady defense drew great ap
plause.

For several months Gilbert Brothers
have been paying interest on time depos
its, as high as tt per cent being offered.
The largest depositor Is said to be a Polk
County farmer, who has $3600 tied up.
Rumors of the impending litigation
caused many business men to witndraw
deposits the past two months. The opin
ion Is general among well Informed men
that If Mary Johnson's suit should end
in Gilbert Brothers' favor the bank will
pay dollar for dollar. One pathetic fea
ture ot tho failure is that It ties up some
$1500 saved by school children.
F. N. Gilbert last Saturday transferred
his residence to A. Bush, the considera
tion being $5000, and to-day A. T. Gilbert
assigned a $5000 mortgige to John
Hughes. It Is asserted that some credi
tors are befng preierred or being given
collateral security. Gilbert Brothers are
rated by the commercial agencies at $80,
000 and this is accounted a fairly accur
ate estimate. They have conducted a
banking and brokerage business here for
twenty-one years. About ten years aso
they opened a bank in Moscow, Idaho,
F. N. Gilbert conducting it and A. T. Gil
bert the Salem concern.
PORTLAND, April U.â Judge Bellinger
to-day made an order requiring the Gil
berts and Tilmon Ford to appear on
Thursday, April 25, to show cause why a
receiver should not be appointed.
The Gilberts were confidential agents ot
William Gosper, a wealthy farmer, who
died ten years ago. After his death they
and Tilmon Ford, a Salem lawyer, who
was executor, managed the estate. Yes
terday in the United States court at Port
land Mary Johnson, a daughter of Cosper,
brought suit against the Gilberts and
Ford for an accounting and for the ap
pointment of a receiver: She charged
that the. Gilberts had grown rich by ap
propriating funds ic themselves which
should have gone to her father's estate,
and that the estate was reasonably worth

bank in this city failed to open its doors
this morning.- and a notice was posted
stating that this course had been taken
because of pending litigation and for th'j
purpose of protecting depositors. No
official statement cf Its condition was
given out, but- from faiFly accurate

amount to $125,000.
It is asserted that when the bank closed
Its doors last night there was little more
than $1000 on hand. Heavy withdrawals
were made last week. The "Gilberts tried
to raise money to tide them over, but did
not succeed, for tho reason that there
was doubt about thoir title to the securi

The perfect blood purifier is Hood's

Sarsaparilla
Is America's Greatest Sprine Medicine.
Pure blood results from wholesome food
thoroughly digested. Impure blood results
J from poor digestion end assimilation
"When the stomach refuses to work prop-
erly the food remains too lonp a time
fermenting, forming gases, shown by
sour, bitter taste In the mouth, bloating
and belching of pas, and distress and dis-
comfort generally. Poor blood, weak
'nerves, sleeplessness and a general don't
care feeling can always be. traced -to im-
perfect digestion.
This is . the reason why Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are. superior to all other
rpriner medicines and blood purifiers.
They give perfect digestion; the food does
not lie In the stomach for hours. They
give a vigorous appetite, sound sleep
Ftrong nerves, and wholesome food well
digested makes pure blood, and in no
other way can the blood be purified. The
Idea that a medicine, in itself, will purify
the blood when the stomach and diges-
tive organs are out of crder Is nonsense.
Â¦Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are used by
.thousands in preference to "bitters,"
"after dinner pills" and "blood purifiers"
because they remove the cause of the Im-
pure blood, and you do not have to taice
them forever to get results. Dyspepsia
Is an obstinate disease to cure and a
â¢remedy must be designed especially for
It and nothing else. Cure-alls will not
cure dyspepsia. . V.. â¢'.
1 Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are not
claimed to cure everything or anything
except Dyspepsia and stomach troubles,
and for that it stands alone among pat-
ent medicines. Any one suffering from
any trouble with their digestion will nnd
these tablets will give immediate relief
and a permanent cure.

think we must dose ourselves with sarsa-

to me, and, therefore. I recommend that the
application for pardcj be granted.
Tho case 1b in many respects a remark*
able one, and has attracted considerable
attention. Wolfson waa a prominent law*
yer in New Orleans before the failure of
the bank in 1S3G and had been a depositor
In the institution for. many years prior
to that time. Of the missing funds he
was charged with having obtained $19,000.
The long legal battle which to-day ended
in Wolfson's pardon then began. Wolf
son had the aid of powerful ana influential
friends. The case was appealed to the
Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed
the decision of the lower court, and was
then carried to the Supreme Court. Mean
time Wolfson continued the practice of
his profession in New Orleans until the
breaking out of * the Spanish-American
war. Being then under sentence, with his
case still pending in the Supreme Court,
he enlisted in the volunteer army, with
the coiÂ»^;^t of the Attorney General and
the SeÂ«*Â«wary of War, and served until
Februai^, 1899, when he was mustered
out. He then enlisted In the regulars and
went to the Philippines, where he served
until October, 1900, when he was invalided
home. In January of the present year
the Supreme Court refused the writ of
certiorari and Wolfson applied for execu
tive clemency. He still has about one
year to serve in the regular army before
his term of service expires. He expects
to return to the Philippines immediately
and rejoin his regiment.

W,, WASHINGTON, April 81-Acttv*
measures have been taken by the Federal
Government to prevent tho sueeeia of
plots hatched by anaiehtsts tn the United
Bt&teft against tho lives of European
rulers.
Aa a result of diplomatic representations
made to the State Department Secretary
of State Hay, through the Governors of
New York and New Jersey and other
States, has communicated with the police
of cities and seaports requesting them to
keep under surveillance all persons known
to have connection with anarchical so
cieties and to prevent the departure from
the United States of any person or per-
Bons who may be suspected of having
been chosen to slay foreign potentates.
The attention of the police of New York
and Paterson, N. J., has been especially
called to the necessity of exercising the
utmost vigilance.
It was learned to-day that this Govern
ment was asked several months, ago to
make a statement of its position with
reference to the suppression of anarchists.
Some of the powers of Europe would like
the United States to enter . Into an ar
rangement which would permit the ap
prehension and imprisonment of all per
sons known to be connected with an
archical societies. The American consti
tution permits freedom of speech and the
administration believes that it is much
wiser to permit persons having anarchical
views to express them, so that they can
be more easily watched, than to cause
them to meet in secret and thus escape
detection until the crimes they contem
plate have been accomplished. It is
doubtful If this Government would be
willing to bind, itself to any course of
action with respect to the apprehension
of pers6ns suspected of being affiliated
with anarchical societies.

"We do not wane tne shipments and
the fruit traffic rightfully belongs to the

that the volume of fruit coming north
would not be great enough to cause our
line sufficient financial gain to enter into

here yesterday at a farm In the neighbor
hood, now falls upon the father of the
children. It is suggested that the father
murdered the children in a fit of drunken
madness, as he spent the evening- in drink
ing and as no Iraee of the alleged tramps
has been found. It is a strange fact that
while the children were killed with a ham
mer or bludgeon, their father was only
stabbed and his wounds were slight. The
knife with which these wounds were made
belongs to the house and a bloodstained
jacket belonging to Briere, the father
was discovered in the courtyard, hidden

with the corpses of his children late yes

contemplates. The Adjutant General's of
tfee believes that this should be at least
â¢40,000. but General Miles holds that the
conditions do not require such a force,
and, furthermore, the number of men
fixed for the United States is absolutely
needed to garrison fortifications and posts
in the interior of the country.
Under General Miles' plan the army will
be thus distributed among the three arms:
Infantry, 38,440; artillery, 18,912; cavalry.

The strength of the Infantry company
twill remain at 104, as at present. Com

larger number of men on their rolls will
be reduced. A troop of cavalry now has
100 men. It will be reduced to 85. A bat
tery of field artillery will consist of 1C0
men and a battery of coast artillery of
103. Practically all of the artillery will
be stationed in the United States, and at
least 21.000 of the home regiments will
consist of infantry and cavalry. It is the
purpose of the department to withdraw
the artillery now in Havana. A couple of
batteries now In the United States will be

The \constitutional convention has never
vcted on or rejected the Platt amendment
This I can state positively, notwithstanding
tho reports to the contrary which have been
sent to the United States . from Havana
Things have been cabled here which had not
the shehtest foundation in fact, which de
scribed strained relations between the repre
sentatives of the United States and those of
the Cuban people. Everything has been, har
monious since I went to Cuba, and the con
vention now in session is a thoroughly repre
sentative one. Before the Platt amendment
was passed by Congress the Cubans knew the
desires of this Government on the Issues
which the amendment contains, because they
were submitted to them through the execu
tive. Intervention and the establlshme nt of
naval stations are two things Which they do
not properly comprehend, and I .think that
when they are fully explained in Washington
the only indication of Â¦- a difference : of opinion
will have Â¦ been , removed. â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦ Â¦
The members of the commission represent
all the different groups of i Cubans composing
the constitutional convention. They have
come to the United States for the purpose
of conferring with Mr. McKinley on matters
which the convention does not thoroughly un
derstand -and when they return and make
their report. I am convinced that there will
be a thorough understanding on all sides of
the controversy.

Corporal Davis was seen yesterday and

in. Those that have not are kept out and
it is my duty . to see that they remain
out.
"Those who have not been lucky enough
to secure a pass have resorted to all sorts
of schemes to get one and have not suc
ceeded, owing to my efforts, and I look
on their charge as an effort to secure
my removal from the post of provost ser
geant. I know every man who has a right

Oliver A- Gardner, Edward Parker, George
W. Blair, John J. Keating, John N. Mey
ers and John W. Dodson, conductors. The
operations, it Is claimed, have been going
on for several months. The punched
tickets turned in by the conductors are
first checked up "at the offices and then
burned by the employes. The investiga
tion that has been in progress, it is stated,
discloses that many of the tickets, instead
of being destroyed, were saved and sold
to conductors at 51 per 100, and that the
conductors who bought them substituted
them for good tickets. This Â¦was done by
turning in the old tickets to the company
at the close of each day, the same number
of good tickets being retained in the pock
ets of those who were in the conspiracy.
It is also alleged that in many cases the
number of fares rung up and the number
of passengers on trips have shown a wide
divergence.

CLAIM CARMEN
PRACTICE FRAUD
The price of the corporal's blind
ness is stated to bÂ© a high one. On
one occasion it is said he demanded $25
from a merchant who had bills amount-
Ing to but 550 to collect. The merchant
refused to pay and was not allowed in the
camp. The stories of Corporal Davis' al
leged crookedness were brought to the at
tention of Colonel Rawles, and he detailed
Lieutenant Carleton to investigate the
charges. No proof could be obtained that
Davis had been bribed and the affair was
dropped for a time. The merchants, how
ever, were not satisfied and brought the
charges to headquarters and the order for
the arrest of Corporal Davis followed.
Davis is better known as Sergeant
His Alleged Price a High One.
OWEN DAVIS, cham
// plon broadswordsman of the Unt
il . ted States army, and a victor in
many contests with some of the
most skillful swordsmen in Euro
pean armies, has been ordered under ar
rest at the Presidio. His arrest brings
out a story oÂ£ alleged crooked work in
connection with his duties as provost ser-
Reant at the Presidio.
The charge which caused Davis' arrest
emanates from a clothing dealer at the
Presidio and is a direct result of the \e
cent maltreatment of the collectors In the
camp of the Thirtieth Infantry. In his
official capacity Davis was entrusted with
the carrying out of the order issued by
Colonel R&wles, which prevented the mer
chants and others from entering: the
reservation for the purpose of soliciting
trade. According to one of the merchants
he has allowed favored ones to enter the
gTounds and has been paid for his failure
to see them as they entered the grates.
It is alleged that he has demanded money
cf them on numerous occasions, and their
refusal to pay has always resulted in their
being kept from, the camp.

NEW YORK, April 23.â News has Just
reached this city of the massacre by a
band of Indians of many persons and the
destruction in Maranone, Brazil, of the
Roman Catollc mission established there
a few years ago by the Capuchin Fathers.
The mission was organized in 1S96. ! It
was in a desolate district, but the mis
sionaries had been most successful in their
efforts to evangelize the natives and had
already formed two orphan asylums, in
which they cared for the abandoned chil
dren of the wandering tribes of savages.
Although full details of the attack upon
the mission by hostile Indians are not
contained in the advice? received here, it
is said that four of the Capuchin Fathers,
all Italians from the province of Milan;
seven Capuchin Tertiary Sisters and more
thanaoo of their little charges were mas
sacred. '

on the links of the Los Angeles Country
Club, was practicing over the Presidio

BOABD OF MANAGERS
INSPECTING HOMES
Government Officials Looking at In
stitutions for Grand Army
Veterans.
The National Board of Managers of Old
Soldiers' Homes arrived In this city yes
terday and/the members are staying at
the Palace. The party is composed of
Judge M. T. McMahon, chairman: General
C. M. Anderson, Colonel Sidney C. Clarko
and Colonel George W. Steele. The party
is on a tour of Inspection of all the Gov
ernment home3 for disabled soldiers and
also all State Institutions where infirm
soldiers are kept.
Judge McMahon said last evening that
the -most important business of the trip
was the selection of a site for the build
ing of a home that had been ordered
erected at Johnson City. East Tennessee,
at the last session of Congress.
"The Government is at present carlnjr
for 49.000 disabled soldiers." said Judge
McMahon. "This includes a few wounde.1
or disabled In the Spanish war. We are
visiting every home that old soldiers are
living in. The Government allows $100 a
year to all Institutions for the mainte
nance of each old soldier. ' We have to
visit every home where veterans are kept
to see if they are well treated. The home
at Santa Monica appears to be the favor
ite Institution among the veterans. The
place is beautiful and every year vast Im
provements are being: made.
"We will visit the home at Tountvllle
before leavins the State. On our way
back to New Tork we will also Inspect
the homes at Leavenworth. Kans., Dan
ville, 111., and Milwaukee, Wis."

The commencement exercises of Â¦ the

An aged racegoer by the name of Moody
was seized with a feeling of illness soon
after reaching the track, and though med
ical attendance was auickly on hand, he
died. He was a familiar figure about the
track, apparently possessing means to
speculate with.
American Trap-shooting Team said to
day: "Unfortunately we had already ar
ranged for the shooting tournaments in
this country during July. However, we
will endeavor to have the home dates
changed in order to be In London at the
desired time. I am inclined to think the
matter can be arranged satisfactorily."
Mr. North cabled the British team to
day as follows: "Trying to get earlier
date; will advise by cable." Mr. North
stated the American team would probably
shoot against teams in Glasgow and Dub
lin following the London match.
Chief Deputy Myrtle Resigns.
Fred S. Myrtle, chief deputy In the Re
corder's Office, resigned his position yes
terday and Recorder Godchaux immedi
ately appointed Charles Stoltz to succeed
him. Myrtle has been in ill-health for
some time past, and his duties became too
arduous. Godchaux has offered Myrtle
the deputyship made vacant by Stoltz's
promotion, but Myrtle has not yet signified
his acceptance.

To-Day's Entries.
Scotch Plaid retains his form, easily
performing the trick In the mile and a
furlong event. Ridden by Ransch, he held
sway in the ring at odds of 3 to 5 and led
from start to finish. Goldone outlasted
Catastrophe, securing the place. Merops
appeared to no advanta.ee.
For the first time the colors of "Cap"
Tilles, the well-known St. Louis turfman,
were seen first past the finishing post.
It was in' the concluding number, a six
furlong sorlnt, decided under selling con
ditions. Hindoonet sported the St. Louls
an's all blue, and after a hard drive with
Good Hope, got the verdict by a- head,
with Mocorito in the show. Dominick on
Valencienne, which with Dollie Weithoff
enjoyed the honors of favoritism, beat
the others away, but could not last. Dol
lie Weithoff appears to have lost her
form.
Barney Schreiber's Boundlee spoiled. a
good thing In the second slx-f urlong run.
Flamero of Don sCameron's string* with
Ccvi.ley up, waa played from threes to S>
to 5 favoritism. After the gelding had
raced Handlcapper into the ground he was
collared and beaten a head by the Schrei
berl horse, handled most judiciously by
Dominick. â¢ - . .
Dominick's cleverness also put Gusto
over the plate winner of. the third num
ber, at six furloners. The brown horse
ruled a 6 to 5, favorite, and though he

PEKING. April 23.â The Chinese troops
have retired from Shansi. The advance of
the French and German troops stopped at

.' Many applications have been made to
Commissioner Rockhlll and General Chaf
fee by Chinese of all degrees for the re
tention in China of the American troops
until the gercral withdrawal of the troops
of the powers. Many of those who are
-making this request think the withdrawal
Â¦ of the Americans will make the others re
main longer. There are als=o people who
<1o not desire to see any of the soldiers go,
fearing anarchy and an uprising.
Germans Want to Guard Gate.
. K}rld Marshal von "Waldcrsee has made
an application that the gate of the For
bidden City be guarded by German troops
after the departure of the Americans.
General Chaffee has replied that Am
erican soldiers -will continue to guard the
gate. At this the Germans are Indignant,
saying this impugns their honesty and
â¢that if the United States desires to do
her share of the policies of the city she
should leave behind enoush troops for
lhat purpose; that merely a few men be
longing to tho legation guards should con
iroi the gate, tvhirh will be within the
American quarters, cannot be allowed. If
Chaffee persists In this course diplomatic
representation will be made in the
matter.

"WASHINGTON. April 23.â It is under
stood here that the Chinese plenipoten
tiaries at Peking. Prince Citing and Li
Hung Chang, are prepared to give a guar
.nr!te* to the powers for the protection
nf p x u foreigners ir. China if the foreign
troops now stationed there are with
drawn. Thus far the retention of the
foreign forc-es has been urged as neces
sary 1n order to preserve order and pro
tect foreisTiprs. but the Chinese authori
ties ray that order has been so far re-es
tablished that the Imperial Government
is fully able to direct the Chinese troops
in such a way as to secure complete
safety to the interests of all foreigners.
This is understood to be the basis of the
withdrawal of 10,000 French troops, and
it Is earnestly bopr>d among Chinese offi
cials that this -vnll be followed by a
similar movement on the part of other
foreign forces in China.

C. April 23. â Dr. Ament of Peking, who
is en route for San Francisco, has thrown
some new light on the death of Professor
Hubert James. It seems that in the early
days of the siege he was imprisoned for
ref using to bend the knee to the generalis
simo and 'was beheaded seven days later,
his head being exposed at the Flowery
Gate. Identification of the latter has
placed his fate beyond question.
On April 10 a terrible fracas occurred
bet-ween a party of thirty English and
thirty French sailors. One Englishman
was killed, whi'e the French suffered
severely. While the details are not yet

The development of the sport In Cali
fornia is closely observed by Mr. Carolan.
He notes that Eastern experts, who for
merly went to Aiken, S. C., in the winter
season, prefer to come to: California. The
purpose he has in view in the extension
of polo grounds is to afford Eastern and
resident admirers of the sport all the fa
cilities demanded by the widening inter
est in this form of outdoor exercise.
The transportation companies have al
ready derived considerable revenue from
the polo tourists.; Burlingame has been
enlivened by the sojourn of these Eastern
players, who formerly went to South Car
olina. Returning East they proclaim- the
advantages of Burlingame as a polo re
sort and bring back with them other men
of means who have a fancy for this style
of field exercise. In this manner the resi
dent population of Burlingame Is aug
mented, as many who come with their
friends to pass the winter decide to re
main all the year round. The railroad,
companies are beginning to find that it
pays to make known to the Eastern world
the attractions which Btorllngame pre
sents to the disciples of polo.
The Burlingame Club, with its club
house and twelve acres of land, is an es
tablished social institution apart from the
polo clubs, yet it Is in sympathy with the
field organization.' All the leading polo
players are members of the Burlingame
Club proper, but all the dub members are
not players. '
Mr. Carolan's purchase of the Corbitt
ranch and the creation of a new polo field
will not transfer the present attractions
of Burlingame to another section of San
Mateo County. No changes in the char
acter or purposes of the Burlingame Club
are in contemplation. The purchaser hav
ing faith in San Mateo land values, and
believing that . property on the peninsula
of San Francisco is bound to increase in
value, bought the land.
Francis J. Caxolan, president of the Bur
lingame Polo Club, has purchased a large
\ract of the Corbitt ranch, east of the
railroad track and near Burlingame. A
sum approximating $250,000 was paid for
the land and improvements thereon. Mr.
Carolan bought the property as an invest
ment. He Intends to establish another
polo field on the race track of the ranch
and lease it to the polo club of Bur
lingame, so the players may use one field
while the grass Is growing on the other,
and thus stimulate interest in the game.

A hint of what may turn out to be a
portion of the defense in the trial was
presented in the cross-examination of Dr.
Swan by Counsel Bartlett. who asked
many questions with reference to the
number of times the Â¦witness had Been the
bullet he extracted from the body of Rich
ard H. Grogran. Dr. Swan said he had
seen It twice, once In October,, before the
Grand Jury, and once In the office of the
District Attorney, later in the year. The
manner In which these and other ques
tions were put led many to conclude that
the defense would maintain that the bullet
on exhibition was not the one taken from
Grogan's body.
The disclosure on the part of the wit
ness that he had performed a second au
topsy on the body of Grogan at the tomb
In Mount Auburn Cemetery was the sen
sational bit of testimony of the day. Dr.
Swan, accompanied by Medical Examiner
Durrell of Somervllle. State Detective
Wbitley and nn undertaker went to the
tomb and the vitness removed from Gro
ean's body a piece of the fifth rib and a
fragment of the bone which he had sawed
at the first autopsy. "Witness admitted
that the defense was not represented at
the autopsy, nor had any notice of the
Intention to hold the autopsy been given

Instructor charged -with^he murder of his

the prosecution's case was presented at
the opening of court to-day. The attor
ney asserted that on the day previous to
the one on which Grogan was shot he had
accused Eastman of "being out with a

Eastman were shooting at a target neigh
bors heard cries of "help." "murder." and
the two men were seen engaged in a
struggle. When neighbors reached Gro
gan he was lyinsr on the. ground, groaning
and accusing Eastman of having mur

with the declaration that It was an acci

The cause of biliousness is the lack of age â too much haste
to put the beer on the market. To ferment beer thoroughly gg&i]
requires a process of months. Without it the fermentation takes R)jn
place in your stomach. That is the cause of biliousness. Fj^l

strong musical tendencies. Competent
critics have spoken most favorably of her
musical ability, and the object of the
benefit Is to assist her in taking a course
in music at Berlin.
The proposed benefit concert will be ren

demonstration of what apparently insur
mountable obstacles those afflicted with
blindness may overcome will be a source
of great interest to those who may attend
the concert. Those who will take part
besides Miss Whaley are Miss Paraskosa

The most encouraging news to-day came
from Point Pleasant, where the river be
came stationary and later reports show
that it is falling aa far down as Marietta
and Parkersburg. In some of the smaller
places bells were rung, cannons fired and
jollification meetings held when the sta
tionary stage was reached. Preparations
are being- made for demonstrations of re
joicing throughout the Pomeroy Bend to
morrow. Pomeroy, Middleport and other
places in , that district have been badly
Inundated, and hundreds of families
driven from their homes. The railroad
stations at these places were under water
and the offices moved to higher ground.
Since the crest has passed there is great
alarm at Ashland, Ironton, Huntington,
Portsmouth and other lower points, where
the crest of the flood is now passing and
where false reports have been circulated
about another rise. One of these reports
was that there had been a cloudburst up
the Big Sandy, seriously affecting Cat
lettsburg. The flood had caused the nat
ural gas pipe line supplying this place to
burst and the people were -left without
light or fuel there. â¢ The large rolling mills
and factories at this place were compelled
to shut down for the same reason. From
that point to Cincinnati the rise fluctu
ates from one-tenth of an Inch in some
hours to almost three-tenths in other
hours, and when it increased to-night
there was renewed alarm at Ironton and
Portsmouth and points opposite them.
The weather bureau here, however, re
ports to-night that a second rise is not
threatened, and that the flood continues
to pass out of the Ohio 1 Valley more rap
idly.
CINCINNATI. April' 23.â While the Ohio
River Is reported to-night as falling', from
Pittsburg to the mouth of the Big Kan
ahwa, almost 300 miles, there is still much
distress from that point to -Cincinnati,
about 200 miles. The weather bureau still
predicts that the limit will be reached to
morrow and there will be still less trouble
below the city. 'While alarming: reports
come from Portsmouth, Huntingdon, Cat
lettsburgf and intermediate pbints to-night,
the weather bureau says the outlook is
really encouraging and the beginning of
the end will reach Cincinnati to-morrow,
when the stage will not exceed 58 feet.

ries are falling, as well as the head
waters. . Â¦

It is suspected that the men who per
petrated the robbery were In Memphis
last night. A short time before the west
bound train over the Kansas City, Fort
Scott and Memphis left the Calhoun
street station, at 8:30 o'clock last night,
two men approached the ticket window
and asked for tickets to Bridge Junction.
Ticket Agent Coltart and Night Agent
Washington were on duty at the time.
They declined to sell the ticketsto that
place, as no trains stop there. The men
insisted on buying tickets, both apparently
anxious to board the outgoing Kansas
City train. They, stated that tickets were
wanted for several persons.
The supposition is that the robbery was
planned to take place at Bridge Junction
and that the robbers were the men who
wanted tickets to that point last night,
their purpose being to go to Bridge Junc
tion on the Kansas City train at 8:30
o'clock and wait for the coming of the
Choctaw express, which reaches Bridge
Junction about 12:03 a. m. .
General Agent Longacre of the Wells-
Fargo .Express Company, who went to
Hurlbert, near the scene of the robbery, on
the outgoing train. this morning, returned
this afternoon. He said that every effort
was being made to apprehend the bandits
and that private detectives and special
agents of the railroad and express com
pany were engaged on the case. Owing
to the bottoms being overflowed he does
not think the bloodhounds will be ablÂ« to
trail the robbers. The Wells-Fargo Ex
press has a standing reward which- will
apply In . this case. Mr. Longacre thinks
the robbery was the work of seven men.

ST. PETERSBURG, Monday, April 22.â
Local speculation concerning the visit
here of M. Delcasse, the French Minister
of Foreign Affairs. Is apparently not
formed from authentic reports. One ver
sion, which Is told with the greatest posi
tiveness In spite of its Inherent Improb
ability, is to the effect that the French
Government has received from an un
named source what purported to be a
plan for a British-German war against
France, supposedly in some colonial dis
trict. M. Delcasse, it is added, communi
cated the contents of the plan to the Rus
sian Embassador at Paris, Prince
Curouseff, who, however, laughed Incred
ulously, pronouncing the project a hoax.
M. Delcasse Is said to have been not sat
isfied and to have wired Count Lams
dorff, the Russion Foreign Minister, ask
ing if It would be agreeable for him to
come to St. Petersburg and discuss tha
matter. Count LamsdorfC consulted with
the Emperor, who gave an affirmative
reply. M. Delcasse has presented Count

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
New Floating Dock Building.
A new floating- dock for Spear street is
being built at Hunters Point for the Cal
ifornia Dry Dock Company. It will cost
$120,000 and will be 270 feet long and 85
feet wide. It will be completed and In po
sition next September.
The big steamship Hawaiian had a nar
row escape while on her way here from
New Tork. While entering the harbor of
Saint Lucia she struck on a rock. As
she made no water it was thought the
damage was slight. When the vessel
arrived here she was discharged and
placed on the drydock. It was then dis
covered that there was a dent fourteen
feet long by ten feet wide that will re
quire the removal of five plates and seven
frames to repair. Luckily the damage
was over a water tank. Had it extended
seven inches farther aft the Hawaiian
would have filled and sank.
Accident to th.e Hawaiian.
Otto Gildemeister. is to be sold at auc
tion next Monday. The chances are that
she will be purchased by San Francisco
parties and resparred. It is very doubt
ful whether she can be got. under the
American flag. The hull is said to be only
slightly damaged and spars, sails, rig
ging, anchors and chain do not count
when it comes to repairing a vessel for an
American registry. A case in point is that
of the British ship Willscott. She put in
here dismasted and was later sold to John
Rosenfeld's Sons, â¢who repaired and put
her under the Nicaraguan flag. Later she
got a Hawaiian registry and came under
the American flag with annexation.
The Otto Gildemeister was formerly the
British ship Zemindar. She is 2009 tons
net burden and was built In 1885 by Hnr
land & Wolff of Belfast. She is 292 feet
6 inches long, 39 feet 7 inches beam and 23
feet 5 inches deep. She was sold to the
Germans last year by T. and J. Brockle
bank of Liverpool. She -was on her way
to the coast from Yokohama when she
was caught in a typhoon and dismasted.
Reinsurance on her went as high as 90
per cent and now that she has been con
demned there seems to be a doubt as to
whether the gamblers will get their
money. It is a knotty question and will
have to be settled in a court of law. There
was not much money risked on the vessel
in San Francisco.
THE United States army transport
Warren will go into commission
again next Saturday and will leave
for Nome with army supplies May
1. She has been thoroughly over
hauled at an expenditure of more than
$150,000, and is now in better condition
tha,n when she was purchased from her
German owners at the outbreak of the
war. Ever since ehe came in from Ma
nila more than 500 workmen have been
busy on her engines, boilers and interior
f ttings and hardly a single repair now
remains to be made.
New tubes ruid furnaces have been put
in and new connections have been made
to the boilers. The engines have been
thoroughly overhauled and the cylinders
bored and new pistons put in. The bal
last tanks have had new tops puts on,
the piping system for fresh and salt water
has been renewed and all the sheathing
has been torn out and the hull cleaned
and painted and new sheathing- put in.
A new electric system and an evaporator
with a capacity of 3000 gallons has been
installed. The decks have been over
hauled and recalked, a new smokepipe
and new butchering put in the boilers and
a. new smokestack put in. A new steam
launch has been added to the equipment
and a new storeroom, new galley and
new quarters for the engineers have been
fitted up. A new bronze propeller replaces
the old one.
Nearly all the old ot5cers were trans
ferred to other vessels. Captain James
Barneson will go out in command and
Captain H. Stanley will be quartermaster
captain. Captain Stanley was formerly
aid on General Otis' staff at Manila. W.
H. Phillips, formerly first assistant engi
neer of the Thomas, will go out as chief
of the Warren. Other positions will be
filled from vessels now in port.

rOABDHTG MASTERS WBOTH.
Sailors Leave Vessels at Honolulu
"Without Paying Bills.
Men Tfho went to the islands to fill the
places of striking: mates are not in the
best of humor and the coasting boarding
masters are vowing- that they will not
supply sailors to the vessels plying be
tv.-een this port and Hawaii.
The bearding masters find that the sail
ors they trust leave their vessels at Hono
lulu and they are left to whistle for their
money.
In the cases of the boarding- masters
end c'.cthiers the men leave here owing
them bills and never come back. In the
old days a sailor shipped for the round
voyage. He does the same thins now,
but if he demands his pay at Honolulu
the law says he must get it. All hands
quit the Gerard C. Tobey at Honolulu,
eight men left the Roderick Dhu at Hilo,
ten men cult the Georee Curtis, four men
the Irmgard. five men the Mauna Ala at
Honolulu and from three to six men every
vessel that went from here to the islands.
Every one of these sailors owes the board
ing rraster and outfitter a. bill.
The Shipowners' Association and the
Seamen's Union have the matter under
discussion and the chances are that some
remedy will be devised. The shipowners
aM Friday and the seamen Saturday
next.

\A UCH in the way of ill news has come of late
/ \ from Austria. The continuous wranglings in
* * the Reichsrath and the repeated outbreaks of
discontented and unemployed workingmen have held
the most conspicuous place in all dispatches from the
empire. Indeed, so ominous of disaster have bean
nearly all reports from Vienna that the public has be
come well-nigh convinced of the correctness of the
prediction . that upon the death of Francis Joseph
there will be an outburst of civil war which will not
end until the empire has been dismembered and
blotted from the political map of Europe. '
It appears, however, that affairs are by no means so
bad in the Austrian empire as they seem, when atten
tion is confined to political disturbances. The people
arc enjoying a fair degree of prosperity and have
from an industrial point of view bright prospects be

A very nice problem has arisen in connection with
the operation of the Chicago drainage canal. The
sanitary authorities decided that to completely carry
away the sewage and prevent the contamination of
the rivers into which Use canal empties, there should
flow through it 400,000 cubic feet of water every min
ute; but the result was the immediate lowering of the
lake 'evcl to a point :hat made navigation dangerous,
and r.c-.v Secretary Root has ordered that the flow bÂ£
limited to 200,000 cubic feet. The question is whether
navigation or public health is the more important, and

The great issue that concerns the Western world is
r.ct the conversion of Chtna, but the conversion of the
Christian nations to Christianity.
It is an evil for whi;h plain speaking is the only
medicine. The more plain speaking the better for ac
tual Christianity, which is not a dogma that must be
taught with Krag-Jorgensons and written in the blood
of slaughtered innocence, but a life to be lived in illus
ttation of the gentle and humane precepts of its
fovnder.
The result is that *hose of good heart, the lovers
of humanity, those wIid believe in manhood honorable
znd in womanhood undefiled, are averting their faces
from that which is taught as Christianity, and the very
lands which send forth the soldier to kill and the mis
sionary to convert are falling away from a system
in which the people detect such a gulf between pro
fession and practice.
The worid should this time be sufficiently informed
of the Chinese situation to conclude that wisdom re
t.ufres that the secular Governments of the Western
powers should cease til participation as Governments
in the so-called evangelizing of China. Secular and
SAcrosanct partnershio in China has caused a thou
sand murders to one tonversion, and has defiled an'!
destroyed, spread woe, sorrow, dire death and dis
tress, and has soaked the soil with the blood of the
innocent. It has done worse tlÂ»an this. It has propa
gated in the Christian world the most awful heresy
that the mind can conceive. It has caused it to be
preached that these crimes must of necessity accom
pany the evangelizing of a people, and that they are
the chosen process of the Almighty!
IT is reported that the numerous appointments of
Chinese with anti-foreign tendencies alarm the
missionaries and other foreigners as to the fu
mre. Why should it not? We have no doubt that the
election of strong anti-Chinese public officers in this
State alarms the Chinese, but let any candidate run
ci. a pro-Chinese platform and take his medicine. In
view of the established and undisputed facts concern
ing the conduct of the foreign armies in China, what
are we to expect of human beings with the experience
the Chinese have with foreigners?
ALARMS IN CHINA.
The new plan will be an improvement upon the
old, and from it there may come the formation of a
comprehensive system of, forest control and preser
vation. The issue is one toward the solution of
which* the National Government might well lead the
way. It would also be beneficial to the whole coun
try-if New Jersey would undertake in good earnest
the plan that has been proposed there. The Ameri
can people are prompt to follow a good example of
business, and if New- Jersey can at the same . time
save her forests and make an increasing profit from
them'it would not be long before other progressive
commonwealths would follow her lead.
In addition to the movements undertaken in the
various States there is also a demand for a better
system of forest control on the part of the National
Government. As has been pointed out by a recent
report on the subject: "The system of forest control
now in vogue is at once inadequate, inharmonious and
expensive. There are virtually three divisions of it â
one under the direction of the Geological Survey, one
under the control of the Land" office and one under
the direction of the Division of Forestry of the De
portment of Agriculture â and because of this division
of authority and a consequent lack of concert in ac
tion the service is by. no means as thorough â¢ as . it
should be. â¢ The plan for consolidating these various
branches under a single head has .been adopted by
Secretaries Hitchcock and Wilson after a careful study
of the whole situation, and. under it the Interior De
partment will continue to exercise the' power cf
policing forest reservations against fire and unlawful
timber cutting, while the general work of forest cul
ture and extension will be conducted by the Depart
ment of Agriculture." '
There appears to be nothing in the way of exag
geration in the estimate. The forest area of New
Jersey is 2,o6q,8i<J acres. From those woods there
were cut last year and sold lumber and timber in one
form or another amounting in value to more than
$4,000,000. The principal items were: Railroad ties,
$625,000;; telegraph and telephone wires and poling,
$100,000; fuel for domestic consumption, brick and
tile manufacture, $2,400,000; fencing, $365,000; logs
and bolts at mills, $692,537. There are other sources
by which it is believed at least a million dollars more
is added to the aggregate value of the timber an
nually cut. .
New Jersey is one of the States that has been
promptest to engage in the work. A plan has been
proposed there which is said to be more comprehen
sive than that of any other State in the Union. ' Its
pirn is nothing less than the acquirement by the State
of all the remaining forests within her borders and
of all barren lands that cfcn be used for forest.cultiva
tion. The promoters of the plan estimate that if it be
carried out and the forests be cultivated upon busi
ness principles the . State will within a few years be
pble to obtain from the woods a net revenue of not
less than $500/000, and thus add a large pecuniary
profit to the benefits which will result from the mere
pieservation of the woods. , '
rROM the floods that ,have swept along the
streams and the rivers of the East this spring
new. and forcible arguments will be drawn to
confirm the growing conviction of the people that.it
iÂ£ high time something were done to provide for the
protection and preservation of our forests. It has
been fully demonstrated that the floods are due in a
large measure to the wasting of the woods. Streams
that in former years flawed with an even volume of
water through the summer now rush down in torrents
in the spring. Once they furnished ample power to
turn mill wheels and promote industry all the year
round, but now they -flood the mills in spring and
leave them dependent upon steam for motive power
during the summer.

The writer speaks from experience, hav
ing given many similar demonstrations of
the processes! of sculpture. The interest
shown by people of all ages and classes
Is a constant - surprise. We like- to see ;
things done, and having once seen, we
retain some impression ever after. It is;
a bond of closer sympathy with the art
ist and his productions. "I shall never
see a 'statue a grain without thinking of
your work in the clay," "I had no idea
hew it was done." "I want to thank you
for opening a new world to me"â such are
expressions familiar and . ever grateful to
the lecturer's ear.,: . f â¢ ;_
-Now, let an accomplished, landscape,
man bring his canvas and blackboard and,
after illustrating the classic forms of com

ly in an hour and a half a good man
should be able to work up a very impres

shower of interesting side., hints on va-'
rious methods of .technique, juxtaposition
of colors, values, etc. By, the aid, of the
stereopticon the processes of etching could
be illustrated In the same way, and other
arts as well. â¢'. There are accomplished
masters of these' professions who are
ready and Â¦willing to do such work from
time to time. Their charges would not
be exorbitant and the united art circles
and clubs of the State Â¦will soon be able
to conunand anything that they want."
Forming the Critical Faculty.
The reference above, to composition
.brings us to another point. Art has its*
fundamental , principles. '-.which, .if under
stood, make all " things clear; - Â¦which, if
ignored, leave the student helpless and
muddled. It is not enough to know how
a yainter or a sculptor. does things: it is
even more important to know why he
does,, and /why,- on â¢ grounds *Â¦ entirely re
moved from, sentiment, one result is bet
ter thajj another. .-Here such- works, as
Van Dyke's ''How to Judge a* ; Picture"
and his ; more advanced "Art for Art's
Sake" are helpful. I The best thing that
I have seen on . the elementary principles
of art is that opening number of the "Uni
versity Lessons on; the* Fine Arts," writ
ten by Russell Sturgis. This is really a
Helpful Methods for Beginners.
The first of these is a "speaking ac
quaintance," at least, with the processes
of the arts. How can one hope to make
much out of the history of painting with
out a knowledge of what painting is; its
possibilities, its limitations and its vari
oug means and methods? To whom shall
we go for this knowledge if not to the
painter himself? -
The old method of "thinking up papers"
on art has largely given way to the
labor-saving invention of employing a
â¢'leader", to write them. By this simple
device many clubs are now supplied at a
low rate with critical essays charged with
emotion and discreetly enlivened with kit
ten stories and tales of the painters' loves.
Such a system of vicarious study has its
advantages, but suggests further devel
opment: why not learn of those who can
speak with authority? A course in the
history of painting is proposed; what
would introduce It more fittingly than a
demonstration of the artists' methods by
a skillful portrait painter? We have sev
eral of them in America who could do It
well.. Let him pose a striking model be
fore the audience, arrange his lighting
and accessories, make his" drawing (or
have, it iready). set his palette and then
"paint in" the head and surroundings
with fit explanation at each step. Would
this not make an. interesting and highly
instructive entertainment? Would it not
be something entirelv new to the larger
portion of his audience? Such an initia
tion could not fail to make them feel bet
ter acquainted with Rubens and Velas
quez, with Sargent and Zorn;
X.-AET STUDY IN WOMEN'S CLTTBS.
To the women of America we "owe the
preservation of the fine arts in this coun
try during an age of unprecedented com
mercialism.
Without the enthusiastic support of the
women's clubs art and literature alike
would be practically extinct throughout a
large section of the United States. "Were
our womankind as indifferent to these
branches of culture as were their grand
mothers a few decades, ago their very
names would â¢ soon ' become obsolete and
meaningless. Our twentieth century man,
absorbed in his fascinating.game of busi
ness," with its high stakes and narrow
horizon, would soon.be reduced to a most
limited vernacular. The few gentlemen of
fortune who possess taste as well, the oc
casional student, the schoolmaster with a
liking for literature, the lame and the in
valided who have dropped out of the
great Struggle and find solace in artâ
these all together. form so email a per cent
of the mighty, active aggressive popula
tion of the interior that by themselves
they count for nothing at all in the propa
ganda" of \ ways esthetic. By themselves,
be it noted, for reinforced as they are by
the moral strength of an Amazon army
crusading under the banner of "The True,
the Beautiful and the Good," they in turn
become positive influences. And even the
producers, the writers and the artists
gentle, unclassified dreamers that they
are, lost amid swarming wealth-winnersâ
feel now.and then the unwonted. Joy. of a
sympathetic comprehension; Imagine
themselves for the moment in an "art at
mosphere." ..-.'â¢,
"I want to knew" seems to be woman's
motto in these days. In choosing art as
one.oLthe subjects of greatest appeal the
clubs have selected the most delightful
and at the same time the most elusive of
themes. -, â¢ -
Â¦ You can study arithmetic out of a book;
you can learn a great deal about the ge
ography and geology of the world while
imprisoned within the four walls of a
schoolroom. Grammar and rhetoric, soci
ology, political economy and even theol
ogy are to be had in neat packages, like
condensed soups, ready tor use when
properly thinned out. But art is not so
complaisant. It is neither a mathematic
formula nor a synopsis. It is more than a
zinc etching or a half tone. You can learn
a vast deal about it and yet know nothing
of it. A class may study the history of art
for months and yet remain unable to tell
a good picture from a bad one. A club
may compile monumental essays on j art
for twenty years and yet fail to recognize
a masterpiece unless It be labeled.
Difficulties in Art Study.
To illustrate how the unguided student
may travel all around a subject and quite
miss its vital essence imagine an art cir
cle endeavoring to comprehend the work
of Claude Monet through the aid of re
prcductions in black and white. How ot
ten they have been discussed by the hour
without a suspicion of their real signifi
cance in the evolution of art! The half
tones show only what the pictures lack;
their absence of sentiment, their Indiffer
ent composition, their shortcomings, ac
cording to all classical precedent. Of
their sparkling sunshine, their delicate
tones, their exquisite values the reproduc
tions give no notion. Beside a neat Bharp
photograph of one of Gerome's groups
they would be voted unworthy of atten-
Take as another example the sculptures
ofM. Rodin. To the conscientious begin
ner gazing upon single views of figures
in the round how perfectly incomprehen
sible some of those strange creations
must appear! It Is impossible that. they
should convey in any wise the sculptor's
point of view. A single glance at the Bal
zac would convince the, average self-re
specting admirer of the Apollo Belvldere
that M. Rodin is a fraud. Yet he is con
sidered by many artists and critics the
greatest of living sculptors. â¢
It is evident that what the art classes
need most Is familiarity, not with books,
but with the real thingâ with art itself.
Histories and textbooks of art are neces
sary, and papers prepared and papers
heard are helpful, but there are two or
three things which should precede and
which would illuminate all of this re
search, giving it a new significance.

sponding scope. It is not superficial likÂ«
the little textbooks, nor -is It expanded
into an encyclopedia of prohibitive size
and price. A great advantage which it
possesses over the familiar standard
works lies in its being the latest, and
bringing things up to date. One can nnd

Art Studied In the Light of History.
The thing which the â¢â¢University Les
sons" do not provide, however, and which
no book offers, is that "local color" so
necessary for the full comprehension of
any work of art. ,To understand a pic
ture or statue we must know what man
ner of man created Jt and for whom the
work was done.' To understand the people
we must know the period and the common
possessions of the time. Art can. only be
studied appreciatively, when accompanied
by general history. To estimate a master
piece properly we must be able to view
it In the light of his own era, to disso
ciate it from, all that has been done since
â and to which it may have contributed.
It takes a good deal of knowledge to be
able thus to divest one's self of knowl
edge, to live for the time being in"a given
period of the past. And to put one**
self in the place of the artist who cre
ates for very joy of doing, or in the atti
tude of his publio, enthusiastic and de
vout, it maybe, or critical and discrimin
ating, requires not only knowledge but
imagination. It demands qualities of
heart as well as of mind. To grasp a great
work fully one must know Its original
purpose, its location and its associations.
Some of these things we can never know.
Impossible is It for us .to look at anything
through the eyes of centuries gone. The
work as it stands In the museum, though
complete, has lost halfâ yes, nine-tenths
of its significance. We realize this as we
stare at our dusty casts of Greek sculp
tors, wrested from noble pediments and
rhythmic frieze. It is not less the case
with the -sculptural florescence of the
gothlc period and rich fruition of the re
naissance; how far away It all seems!
Human nature is always the same, they
tell us, but I venture to doubt If we to
day can share fully the fierce Joy of the
inquisitors or the* exaltation of the crus
aders. Do we grasp the significance of
the church building of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries? r>o we realize that
within a circle of 100 miles' radius from
Paris, in a country sparsely settled, there
grew up in that time scores of the most
wonderful edifices that the world has
ever seen? Imagine the northern third of
Illinois studded with such cathedrals as
those of Paris, Chartres, Bourges, Reims,
Amiens, Beauvais, Rouen and all of the
smaller ones! Can we by any stretch of
fancy picture to ourselves the citizens of
Aurora, Elgin and Rockford consecrat
ing their lives, their wealth and their
children and grandchildren to such works
of splendid devotion? We are as intelli
gent as those old burghers of 800 years
ago, and know an enormous lot of things
they did not know, but childlike faith and
pious emulation have waned with the ad
vancing centuries, the world's capacity for
great and lasting enthusiasms has dimin
ished and at this hour we realise feeblv
the. miracle of those buoyant days when
nations were young.
Value of Breadth of View.
It is for this reason that we must do
our best to gain a point of view, to de
velop our emotions, and to thrill, for the
moment at least, in unison with the pulse
beats of those who wrought and of those
who prayed. â¢
Not only were people busy loving and
hating then, as now, and marrying and
killing as now, and painting and carv
ing, as we do â much less â here and now;
they also amused themselves by writing
chronicles and telling tales and singing
songs. These explain our pictures and
statues and must be studied with them.
That is, sometimes they explain the pic
tures, and sometimes the pictures were
made to illustrate them: often they are,
one and all. the progeny of old folk tradi
tions. At any rate the arts go hand In
hand, and though It may be possible to
know but one, it is a pity, for they are as
like as Italian to French. You can have
both for but little more than the price of
one.
Do not protest that we are piling up an
impossible task for the students of art his
tory. This is not intended for a three
months' course. Nor is it insisted â¢ that
every class begin with Egypt. I am not
at all sure that It is not best to begin with
the known and work back Into the un
known. Be this as it may, my sugges
tion is merely that whereever the class
begins, whatever the period taken up, the
history and literature of the time must re
ceive their full tribute of attention. Try
this method in Ihe study of a single cen
tury or school; search here and there un
til you have built up for yourself a good
picture of the time, until you fairly live
in it. A new world will open before you;
you will never be willing to stop. And the
Kindergarten stories will satisfy you no
longer.
Â¦ Art of the Past and the Present.
There are clubs so profundly erudite, so
enamored of antiquity, that they seem un
able to come down to everyday matters.
Some individuals are mentally long-sight
ed and can distinguish only objects held
at arm's length. The life of our own time
is too near, too commonplace, for them.
Yet, in a sense, it is for this present mo
ment, for us, that all things have been
created. All of the past has contributed
to the hour in which we live; wherein are
gathered together as in a skein the
threads of a thousand converging influ
ences. Surely nothing is so real, so true
and significant to us who tenant the earth
to-day as this work which our brothers
and sisters are doing. With naught else
can we so fully sympathise; It alone is
tangible and it alone brings with it the
appeal of an iridescent future, misty but
big with possibilities. .
â¢ On the other hand, there is danger of
living so completely and complacently in
the present as to lose much of the lesson
of the past. It is a pity to sacrifice all of
the advantages of a historic perspective.
The present means but. little save in the
light of the past. Association is all that
gives value>to anything. No one can hope
to appreciate the art of to-day without the
standard of a thorough familiarity with
the efforts and achievements of those who
have gone before.
Practical Needs of Clubs.
Each club shoujd have its library; or
else, as Is often the case, it3 "special cor
ner in the local library. There should be
likewise a club librarian or secretary ad
dicted to scissors and paste, indefatigable
in rescuing from the flood of ephemeral
literature and reproductions those things
Â¦ likely to be of future use. Their value de
pends largely upon classification and ac
cessibility. Every club should subscribe
to one or more of the good art journals.
. The federated clubs will soon be able to
command not only circulating libraries on
special topics and collections of photo
graphs and autotypes, but even good ex
hibitions under capable management, their
own lecture bureau, and possibly a maga
zine on the lines of the Chautauquan, but
specifically planned for their own work.
So much for the domestic life of art
clubsâ of that which they can do for them
selves. Later I hope to suggest some of
the things whlf'h they can do for others.

Of course The Call is a besotted secular journal, and
the Advocate is a refined, religious and upright or
gan that is mindful of morality and truthfulness. We
leave to it the front of the stage.
The Advocate concludes its caustic attack by say
ing: "Of course it to manifest to all thinking and
iaformed people that this whole string of falsehoods
are given out purely for political effect; not that The
Call has any love for the negro, or cares a snap for
his personal interests. "Such misrepresentation as this
goes a long way toward prejudicing the uninformed
against the Southern people, and especially against
the Southern Methodist Church in the West." We
submit that this is gratuitous. An opinion founded
rpon facts is not prejudice. If Tillman and Mor
gan whom we give as authority, are injuring the
Methodist Church South in the West, we suggest that
the Advocate turn its theological Gatling at them
and raise its siege on The Call. If the editor of that
excellent denominational organ will join the ranks of
the informed he will learn that the policy of the
South, as declared by Morgan, is to disfranchise
the negroes by an illiterate franchise law because their
ancestors were slaves and not voters, and at the same
t*n'e retain their members of Congress and Presiden
iiil Electors. obtained by counting the disfranchised
negroes in the apportionment, though this is forbid
den by the constitution. All frank Southerners, like
Morgan, admit this and cpenly rejoice that the scheme
is a success: In further proof we qall the Advocate's
Â»erious and religious attention to a news dispatch of
the 22d inst. from Birmingham, Ala., which notes
the close of the campaign in that State for a constitu
tional convention which proposes to make practically
but one change in the State constitution, "the elimi
nation of the negro vote by an educational qualifica
tion." To this is added: "The Democratic party has
pledged itself to see that no white man will be dis
franchised." This maans that the plan followed in
North Carolina and other parts of "the Southern
country" is to be adopted in Senator Morgan's State,
and illiteracy is to hit the black voter and miss the
'A-hite. Again let us express the pleasure we feel in
anticipation of the Advocate's citation of the' statute
of "a certain Northern State" of which such a law "is
the exact copy."
If the exception of tn illiterate white voter from
the law because his grandfather voted, and the in
clusion of an ignorant negro because his grandfather
was a sla%'e and could not vote, is not depriving him
of the ballot because of his ancestor's previous condi
tion of servitude and ;s not a violation of the Fed
eral constitution, we would like to know what would
violate it. Senator Tilhran of South Carolina says it
is 3 violation of the constitution, for which "exhibition
of ignorance or malice*' we turn him over to the Ad
vocate for discipline.
"As operated in the Southern country," the law, for
example, in North Carolina, provides that if a man is
descended from one who was a voter prior to the date
of the fifteenth amendment he is excluded from the
operation of the law, though himself illiterate, and
remains a voter by reason of the franchise of his an
cestor. As no negro was a voter "in the Southern
country" prior to the adoption of the fifteenth amend
ment, none can vote on the franchise of his ances
tor. This has come to be known as "the grandfather
clause" in the law "as operated in the Southern coun
try," but the Advocate says that law is "an exact
copy of a statute of a certain Northern State," refer
ring, we suppose, to the law of Massachusetts. Now,
will the Advocate please to specify a certain North
ern State, or any Northern State, which has a "grand
father clause" in its law to exclude illiterates from the
franchise? If it cannot do this will it please to with
draw its'charge that in discussing a public subject of
prime importance The Call shows ignorance or
malice? -
The Advocate says: 'The Call, to have been fair,
should have informed its readers that the law en
forcing these measures (negro disfranchisement) is an
exact copy of a statute of a certain Northern State,
and, also, that the law as operated in the Southern
country is against white and black alike."
He also advises that in. view of the success which
has so far attended the disfranchisement of the negro
it is best to work quietly and with as little discussion
aj possible. He concludes also that the passage of
the Congressional apportionment bill and the count
ing of the electoral vote may be taken as evidence that
the North does not intend to interfere. If quoting
Morgan is evidence of ignorance or malice we will
have to plead guilty.
Our critic read us carelessly. We have quoted a
letter written by Senator Morgan to an editor in Ala
bama in which disfranchisement of the negro is highly
approved and his expulsion from the South is advo
cated. The Senator cays that when -such" expulsion
is accomplished, the Southerners "will be a free and
happy people."
THE Methodist Advocate, organ of the M. E.
Church South, published in this city, denounces
an editorial in The Call on expulsion of the
negro from the South as "Ignorance or malicious-

When those great improvements are under way,

merchants and manufacturers and landowners are find

their business, and who are going about it with vim
and vigor. . .
The. programme of public work recently announced
i^ a notable one and will go far toward settling the
labor question by affording work for virtually all the
unemployed. It has been announced that the general
scheme of the Government is to cover Austria with a
network of railroads mid canals. Nearly $100^600,060
will be spent in the" next five years for railroads, and
a considerably larger sum will be used in the course
of a dozen years for canals. The railroads will com
prise a great trunk line running from the northern
provinces across the Tauern Alps to Trieste, with
branches and connections which will make it a high
way of traffic not only for Bohemia, Moravia and
Upper and Lower Austria to' the coast, but also for
Bavaria and Saxony; thus, it is hoped, enormously
augmenting the importance and prosperity of Trieste
as a center of commerce, i As to the canals, one is to
connect the Elbe with the Danube, and another is
to connect that with the Oder, the Vistula and all the
Galician rivers, thus opening a waterway clear across
Europe, from both the North Sea and the Baltic to
the Black Sea. . Â¦'...'
Such an increase of population during the decide

Where population advances at such a rate there must
be something ~of gencial prosperity, and it would

REIS' TESTIMONY
HELPS SULLIVAN
Treasurer's Paying Teller
Aids the Forger's
Defense.
The preliminary examination of Daniel
J. Sullivan on the charge of having 'orged
the signature of Police Judge Cabaniss
to an order for the return of $1640 bail
money put up by Wong You for the re
lease of fan-tan players on March 13
was commenced before Judge Conlan yes
terday morning. The defendant was rep
resented by Attorney T. J. Lennon, and
Assistant District Attorney Weller con
ducted the prosecution.
As In the case of the Evans forged
crder that was heard before Acting Judge
LÂ«ong and dismissed. J. O. Reis, paying
teller In the Treasurer's office, gave testi
mony that will probably result in the dis
charge of the defendant. He again stated
that the indorsement of Sullivan on the
order was not essential and it might just
as well have . been the indorsement of
Jones or Brown. He also caused a sen
sation by declaring that Judge Cabaniss
wrote his signature in a dozen or more
different ways and he believed the signa
ture to the order was genuine.
The first witness examined was Judge
Cabaniss. He was shown the order and
swore positively that his signature had
been forged and that he had not author
ized any one to sign the order for him.
In cross-examination the Judge went into
lengthy statements as to his metho"d of
signing orders, but he denied that he
had signed them in bunches, some in
blank and some filled in. The defendant
had handed him orders to sign, but he
was always careful to see that they were
properly tilled out. He was being cross
examined as to the contents of the com
plaint which he had sworn to when Wel
ler objected and the objection was sus
tained, but the Judge insisted, as a matter
of privilege, that he be allowed to make an
explanation, and he had his way.
Fenton's Signature Also Forged.
John A. Fenton, clerk in Judge Caba
niss' court, testified that no portion of the'
order had been written by him and his
signature had also been forged. He would
not like to swear positively that the
Judge's signature was forged. t
J. O. Reis, paying teller in the Treas
urer's office, testified that he had paid
the demand to the defendant who had
presented it. He thought the defendant
had indorsed it." In cross-examination he
said he did not think he looked for the
indorsement, as it was not essential to the
payment of the money. An indorsement
was only an accommodation to the- office
and he would have paid the demand
whether or not an indorsement had been
on It. If Sullivan had written Jones or
Brown he would have paid it just the
same. What ho looked to was that the
Initials of C. B. Perkins, receiving teller,
were on the corner as a sign that the
amount was correct.
Judge Cabanis' Writing Varied.
Witness 6aid he was familiar with
Judge Cabaniss' signature. The judge
had a dozen ways of signing his name,
and each was different from the other.
He had hesitated In paying orders on the
Judge's signature till on close and minute
examination he had found It to be genu
ine. ..Â¦â¢;â¢.;
He-examined by Weller, Rels said he
believed the signature of the Judge on
the order in question was genuine.
"Can you swear whether or not that
is Judge Cabaniss' signature?" asked the
court.
"At the time I paid It I could not have
sworn to it. At that time I did not ex
amine it closely. I could not swear to It
now," was the reply.
Rels wanted to explain why he did not
examine the signature closely, but Len
non objected and Rels did not press his
explanation.
Captain Seymour testified that the de
fendant had admitted to him on more
than one occasion that he had forged Ca
baniss* signature to the order and had
so testified before the Grand Jury.
This closed the case for the prosecution
and Lennon moved for a dismissal. The
motion was denied and at Lennon's re
quest a continuance was granted till Fri
day., as he wanted time to secure an im
portCJjl witness.
The almost hopeless nature of the at
tempt of the Federal authorities to crush

Saturday by Marshal Shine and the Chi

ngirtnst the woman tor conducting a house

the telephone was to the effect that tne
Â«j?i;ce was not ready to prefer charges,
and that Kwok was oeing Held anyway as
a witness in a Chinese murder case.
No permanent good would have been
ucumpiished by the arrest of Kwck on
the charge suggested, for she would have
jji.id a nne and the incident would have
i oated there.
Kariy in the morning Judge Heacock
haii fixed the bail of the woman at $3000,
cxj.eeting that application would be mads
to that effect, but no application was

litd to let them remain for a few dayt*.
Mr. Wood worth and Dr. Gardner made
a strong light for the detention of Kwok
Hang lung. She lived here at the time
the Chinese exclusion act went into effect,
and compiled with the registration re
quirement of that act. She was registered
a* "other thJin a laborer." The point was
made that as she had admitted that she
had always been a laborer her certificate
had bec-n obtained through fraudulent rep
resentations. Judge Heacock held that
it fiid not matter, because all Chinese in
this country at the time of the goinfcr int..
effect of the exclusion act and who com
plied with the statute by getting regis
tered as laborer or non-laborer were en
titled to remain here.
It is expected that the remaining women
will claim their release either upon certi
ficates or that they are native-born Amer
icans. In the latter event they will be
required to prove their nativity beyond
the slightest doubt.
In the case of those who have been
landed here upon papers by the Collector,
the documents will not be allowed any
weight in the evidence and the women
will be required to prove their status, de
novo. The fact that they are public wo
men will militate against any claim that
they are the wives of merchants, or that
they belong to any other of the privileged
classes. *
CHINESE DENIED LANDING
MTJST B.ETURN TO CHINA
May Not Be Transferred Within the
United States to Vessel for
Â¦ Mexico or Canada.
A Chinese person, who has been denied
s landing in the United States must be
returned on the ship on which he came
or on a vessel of the same line. He may
not be transferred within the limits of
the United States to a vessel bound for
Mexico or Canada. Such is the decision
of the Commissoiner General of Immigra
tion.
When Customs Collector Stratton took
oftice he addressed an inquiry to Commis
sioner Powderly as to whether Chinese
denied landing- could be transferred to
vessels bound for Alexico or Canadian
l>orts. A clerk in Mr. Powderly's office
answered the communication offhand to
ihr effect that such a course would be al
lowed. When Mr. Powderly was apprised
of what had been done, he wrote an
opinion, taking a contrary view of the
matter. In order to make his meaning
unmistakable he addressed another let
ter to Collector Stratton, which arrived
yesterday. The following is an extract
from It:
The object, and the enly one. contemplated
!n the letter referred to was to Inform you
that un3er the law there Is no authority vested
in thÂ« cdmfnlFtrativ* officers of the Govern
ment to order the deportation to China of sub
jects of that empire who are refused admission
to ports of the United States, such authority
having been conferred l>y legislation only In
the case of those round unlawfully In this
country. The refusal of permission to land,
however. In effect is the same as an order of
deportation to China If rejected Chinamen have
arrived upon vessels plying exclusively be
tween ports of the United States and China
end not touching- on 'he way at foreign ports.
The rejection of a Chinaman, besides. Is a
refusal of permission for him to land for any
purpose or even temporarily, the. only exception
to this brlns his conllr.ement on the dock at
your port, which place of confinement is. in
contemplation of the law, the ship upon which
ho came. It is manirett, therefore, that he
cannot be transferred 10 any other vessel or
nny railroad line with the object of transport
ing him to *ome foreign country, for, of course,
puch transfer would recesMltate a temporary
landing at leart. and any landing, unless he
has been adjudged admissible under the law,
would be a violation thereof. It is plain, there

retained on board the vessel upon which he

NEW YORK. April 23.â There was a slight

bearish as ever. The close abroad was steady,
with spot quoted at Â£117 2s 6d and fu
tures at Â£114 15s. The local situation was a
featureless one, and prices did not vary
throughout the session, closing on the somewhat
nominal basis' of $26. . with demand dormant.
Copper in London was a shade easier Hinder
liquidation and closed at Â£70 7s 6d for spot and
Â£70 17s ,6d for futures. While holding, quite
steady the local market was slow at $17 for
Lake and $16 62% for casting. Lead was Inactive
but nominally steady at unchanged prices, while
In London a decline of 2s 6d was noted to Â£12

The report that the price of steel rails was
to be advanced to $28 per ton was the cause
of the advance in United States Steel, although
professional manipulation was much In evi
dence as it was in all parts of the market.
The announcement over night of an engage
mment of $1,000,000 in gold for export seemed
to have little effect on sentiment and reports
were set afloat that large blocks of Govern
ment bonds were held ready to offer for re
demption, which would provide gold for any
export demand without affecting the money
market. The source of this available supply
of Government bonds was not disclosed. Ster
ling exchange also yielded slightly under the
offerings against the gold shipment" Probably
its recovery later In the day was a large in
fluence in the renewed uneasiness manifest
over the money outlook. The subtreasury Is
again taking money from the market and New
York exchange in the Interior has fallen back
to a discount, indicating a cessation of the
supply of funds from that source. The ad
journment of the Burlington directors without
offering official announcement was a disap
pointment. The success of the bulls in getting
prices up was offset by the very heavy offer
ings to realize attracted by the advance. This
was especially so In the United States Steel
stocks, owing to the suspicion . prevalent In
Wall street that heavy liquidation Is going on
tn these stocks on the part of former large in
terests in the Individual companies absorbed
by the combination and who are retiring.
Bear selling also became very bold and exten
sive when the futility of the bull efforts to
sustain the market began to be seen. The
closing was weak at the lowest and showed
such violent declines from the top level as 5%
in Sugar. i\ in St. Paul, 4K In Brooklyn
Transit. 4 In Consolidated Gas, 4% In Rock
Island and from 1 to over S points in a large
list of Important stocks.
The boo't market was active and Irregular.
Total sales, par value, $1,970,000. United States
Ss coupon declined U (*r cent on the last
call.
Powerful support and violent manipulation
were resorted to in the early dealings and the
success of these measures in turning prices
upward caused a heavy covering movement
among the large short Interest which was
formed yesterday. There were intimations dur
ing the morning that official statements re
garding the Burlington deal would be given
out later in the day and a rumor was current
that it would be found to provide an exchange
of bonds to the value of 180 per cent and a
cash payment of $20 per share, together with
a cash payment of {2 per share for the next
dividend.
NEW YORK, April 23.â To-day 1 a stock mar
ket presented even more variety than that of
yesterday, although the high record of trans
actions established yesterday was not dis
turbed by to-day's business. General dealings
were on a smaller scale than yesterday. In
fact It was not until the urgent selling move
ment of the last hour had gained full head
way that the market presented anything like
the animation which characterized it yester
day. Speculative sentiment ran over pretty
much the whole gamut of emotions, from that
of buoyant animation in the morning to some
thing like collapse in the afternoon. Although
the market closed at net declines throughout
extending in some cases to three or four points
or even more, there was a time during the
morning when the level of prices was mate
rially higher than yesterday and the market
had the appearance of a full resumption of the
bull speculation. The high-priced railroad
stocks continued to be the principal object In
the speculation, especially St. Paul. Union
Pacific and Southern Pacific. Atchison pre
ferred had a strong upward movement and
there were points of strength among the
Southwesterns. Burlington and Northern Pa
cific were strong and held better than tha
average of stocks in the late break. Among
the specialties. Amalgamated Copper recovered
quite vigorously from yesterday's depression
and United States Steel stocks made a show
of strength for the first time in several days.
These were the principal centers of the early
strength in the market, but their Influence was
radiated pretty generally through the list. It
would be somewhat difficult to assign causes
for the early strength or the late weakness.
as it seemed to depend little on news of the
day. The motives of the traders were con
fined for the most part to fears or suspicions
of what others were doing.

CHICAGO, April 23.â The corn market. clung
firmly to. its strong position and while to-day's
trade was probably less than yesterday's In
point of quantities changing hands it was
nevertheless quite active. The motive for
speculative 'activity was that of yesterdayâ
namely, the concentration of long May corn
In the . hands of George H. Phillips and -his
following. The desire for profits, which is al
ways a t factor, was gratified to a limited ex
tent, but the basic*strength of the market was
not impaired. At the opening longs offered
liberally, but so sharp was the demand that in
the confusion sales w;re made simultaneously
from 46c to 46%c, compared with yesterday" s
close at 46%c. Offerings, both of May and
July, the latter bein? also In excellent de
mand, suddenly ceased and both shot upward.
May touching 47c, making a new high record
for the crop. Realizing sent May back to
46c, but this was followed by another rally to
47c. During the closing hour of the session
the wheat weakness caused May to work down
to 46%c. but the close was strong. Uc over
yesterday at 4614c. July sold between 44%c
and 45%c, closing Uc lower at 44%c. Phillips
was credited with buying 1,000,000 bushels of
July.
Â¦ Much wheat with which bulls loaded ' them
eelves yesterday was dumped back In the pit
to-day because Liverpool failed to follow the
advance on this side. May opened i$6>Â»gc
lower at 72@72VÂ»e and It took the combined
influences of the corn strength, heavy seaboard
clearances and conflrmntion of very unfavor
> able crap prospects In Prussia to get the mar
ket up to 72Hc. As the short interest was
small and the cash demand slack, while do
mestic crop advices were as glowing as ever,
longs sought to take profit's and In so doing
broke May to 71Vic The close was heavy,
lHc lower at 7194c.
Oats opened steady and advanced early in
sympathy with corn, but lost the advance on
profit-taking. May do&ed He lower at 23**Â®

Profit-taking sales, coming on a dull market,

northerly winds have continued most of the
week. There have been no injurious frosts.
Early sown grain is etill in fair condition in
most sections, but would be improved by rain.
The continued dry weather and northerly winds
are seriously affecting late Bown grain, which
in some places is turning yellow and will bÂ«
a failure If rain does not come soon. Hay
ing is in progress in nearly all sections; the
yield is said to be unusually heavy and the
quality excellent. Work in hop fields is pro
gressing. Pasturage is very scarce in many
places and needs rain. The soil has become
too dry for cultivation In some sections and
the planting of euear beets will be consider
ably retarded. Vegetables are generally in
good condition. % ,
The prospect for a fali/crop of declduou4
fruits appears to be better* than at this time
Itft week, many sections reporting that the
damage done by frost early In April is not aa
great as has been estimated and that with
the exception of apricots, and possibly prunes
in some localities, there will be almost an
average yield. Grapes are also in better con
dition than had been reported and are remark
ably thrifty in come sections. Olive picking
has commenced in the vicinity of San Diego.
Orange* are in â¢ good condition.
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The report of A. G. McAdle, section director
of the climate and crop service of the Weather
Bureau, for the week ending- Monday, Is as
follows.
The Weather and Crops.
"Strictly good dry prime applee are wanted
but very hard to get. Bids of 4%c are made
and 5c, it is understood, would be paid for
goods of that description. Waste Is quite ac
tive and higher. A large part of the cheaper
warte has been cleared off the market. There
are still several cars offering at 75c. For
choice quality there are bids of Sac.
"Apricots are without special ' feature at the
moment. Stocks are said to be in strong
hands, with come purchases of cheap grades
noted at less than quotations. Consumptive
demend is moderate. In peaches conditions are
practically unchanged. In currants the stocks
throughout the country are reported light, and
with the opening of spring a better business
Is looked for. At the moment the tendency Is
about steady on the spot, with some holders
a trifle stronger In their views on best grades.
"In raisins the movement on the spot con
tinue* small and Jobbing In character. Stocks
of 2-crown loose are said to be comparatively
light, and a few small parcels have been
moved on the M 4 c basis, with some holders
asking up to r.'-c. In 3-crown tales are re
ported at 5%c In a Email way. Seeded are in
a little more request at the coast reduction,
although we hear of no active buying in job
bing quarters. We quote a rar.ge of from
(i^c to 7%c on 16-ounce packages, on which
basis the market is reported fairly steady.
Latest mail reports from New York Bay:
"In prunes there Is reported a fair inquiry
for 40-50S, with the views of buyers slight
ly under those of Eellers. although some busi
ness Is reported in small lots on the quoted
basis. On 40-50s 5%c is believed to be the bot
tom price, and most holders are asking Ec for
80-Â«06. On â¬0-70s some little trade is doing In a
â¢mall way at. It is said, from 4%c to 4%c
according to holder. The coast price in bags
for Santa Clara lruit is 3%c for 4O-50s. 3%c for
Â£0-60s. 60-706 2Â»Â»c. 70-SOs 2 J Ac 80-90s 1%C and 90
100s IVic For the same fruit in 25-lb boxes %c
per pound is added. We learn of no active buying
on this basis in the market here, the disposi
tion being to move slowly in view of the light
buying from consuming quarters. The pur
chase of several carloads was reported to-day,
the same, it is stated. Including the 'four
tiles' association goods. We were unable to
confirm it. Sales of goods to arrive purchased
prior to the reduction are reported also on the
<-ut basis. In Oregon prunes a little Interest Is
thown.
Dried Fruits in New York.
EgfTR continue accumulating, and it Is hard
to get the top quotation for ranch. Store
There is nothing new tn Cheese.
The street is quoting', a weak and over
stocked market for Butter, while the Ex
change quotes It- firmer, owing to. a "specu
lative demand." This, it is said, is for ac
count of parties down south, who are buying
In this part of the State. The Exchanga
marked up Its quotations %c, while open
market prices were weak.

BARLEYâ The market weakened off some

can be matured without any more rain, ex

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Are nominal at 6s 6d.
which is the rate of the last spot charter re
ported. The chartered wheat fleet In port has
a registered tonnage of 15,348, against 29,266
tons on the same date last year; disengaged,
'Â¦ tons, against 4763; on the way to this port,
187.464 tons, against 170,132.
WHEAT â Liverpool was firm at an advance
and Paris futures ---were again higher. The
market at *the . moment depends on the Ger
man situation, which Is reported bad, the Rus
sian crop showing being the worst for years.
At the same time, however, a well-known
English exporter says that England alone will
raise as much more Wheat as North Germany
is short.
Chicago opened easier on disappointing ca
bles, and the demand was moderate. The sit
uation, however, was somewhat relieved by
the free covering of shorts on Monday.
The San Francisco market was higher, ow
ing chiefly -to the continued dry weather,
though the advance- at Liverpool helped the
market a good deal. 'â¢

Evaporated Apples are firm at the advance
already noted, and are not plentiful, either here
or at New York. Peaches are also cleaning
up and a fractional advance is noted. Apri
cots rule firm, and there Is something: doing
right along-. The fact Is, It looks as If the
fruit crop would be considerably cut down this
year, and the market is already working
around Into better shape In consequence. â¢ Pears
alone are dull. The situation in Prunes, Nuts,
Raisins and Honey remains as before stated.
The three latter are dull.

Cherries have a wide range, according to
quality. The small red ones are not wanted,
and even the large black are slow of sale.
There Is nothing especially interesting In
Strawberries.
Thirteen or fourteen cars of Oranges are an
nounced, for to-day's auction. The market for
this fruit is better supplied again, though
prices keep steady under a good demand. Limes
are In good supply and dull, with fresh sup
plies due. Fancy Lemons are firm, but medium
stock is plentiful and dull. Bananas are firm
under moderate stocks'.

The tragic suicide on Monday of F. Law,

$10 was raised in a few minutes. To the

street a. delegation of the hackmen and

emotion when told of the generosity of
her benefactors and piteously moaned,

not returned, Miss Esther Hobbs, a yottngr
woman who claims to be a saleslady In

night by (swallowing a quantity of car

Beyond the burns which her face sus

At the hospital, when she became able
to talk, she. gave her address as 32tH4 Sut

of Esther Hobbs was ever a resident

Insanity.
Mrs. Dlllrtian Is the woman who, when
she lived in East Oakland about three
years ago, had her neignbor, a Mrs. John
son, arrested for sticking needles through
the eyes of her pigeons and chickens. It
turned out that Mrs. Dillman herself was
the one who committed the deed. She
seemed to take delight in torturing the
birds. She was allowed to go unpunished
on account of her uncertain mental con
dition.
It has been next to impossible for the
neighbors to sleep lately on account of
Mrs. Dillman's desire to make noise. She
yells "fire" an3 "murder" at all hours of
the night and fires off her pistol at imag
inary enemies.
ALAMEDA, April 23.â Mrs. Marie Dill
man of 2311 Clement avenue was arrested
this afternoon on a. charge of insanity,
preferred by W. A. Aram, her neighbor.
The woman has made frequent threats to
kill her neighbors, claiming that they are
trying to poison her and her chickens.
Detective Brown took her to the Receiv
ing Hospital in Oakland, where she will
be examined to-morrow for r Insanity.
Mrs. Dillman bears a particular grudge
against Harry Hintz, a boy of 14, whose
home adjoins hers. She threatened to kill
him the first time she got a chance. Two
weeks ago she followed him several blocks
on Park street with a pistol concealed be

people, and said she would use if she
could catch up to her Intended victim.

Scott says that Haynes' accounts are
straight and all delinquent tax collections
have been accounted for. The position
Scott was also considerably put out over
the resolution adorned by the Board of
Supervisors calling him to account for
rot pressing the suits against the tele
phone corporation for delinquent licenses.
This resolution was adopted about a
month ago and Scott immediately Dressed
Ruef into service, together with Peter F.
Dunne, as special counsel to prosecute the
oases. About the same time Haynes
closed up his downtown office as Delin
quent Tax Collector and discharged his
assistants. Ruef's appointment to suc
ceed him followed.
It was rumored among City Hall offi
cials that Haynes' resignation was a
forced one, as Scott had become dissat
isfied with Haynes" dilatory tactics In
prosecuting certain cases against the Pa
cific States Telephone and Telegraph Com
rany for the recovery of unpaid license
taxes on nickel telephone machines. This
is emphatically denied by Scott, who as
serts that Haynes resigned voluntarily
because nf the unfavorable criticism to
â¢which he has been subjected in collecting
delinquent taxes amounting: to a paltry
pum from householders. Scott, however,
states that he was dissatisfied with the
actions of a number of deputy delinquent
tax collectors in exacting payment of de
linquent taxes. These men had often act
ed in a brutal manner toward those who
had failed to pay their personal property
taxes, and Scott had taken Haynes to
task for the acts of his subordinates.
Frank V. Haynes, who has been special
collector of delinquent taxes, has resigned
his position and Abe Ruef has been a.p
jtointed by Tax Collector Scott to suc
ceed him. The resignation of Haynes and
the consequent appointment of Ruef, who
Is Scott's political adviser, occurred two
or three weeks e.go, but the fact was
only made public yesterday.

Supervisors' Finance Committee yester

the purpose of placing the city's wires un

itself was preventing the enforcement of
its own ordinance requiring wires to be
placed underground In the downtown dis

When the ordinance was passed some
three years ago the Board of Supervisors
pledged itself 1 to pass an appropriation
sufficient to remove the city's wires from
the poles of the telephone and telegraph
corporations, but no money had ever been
so appropriated. The corporations were
unable to comply with the law because no
money was available to take down thte
city's wires. The committee took the mat

Sues to Recover Coin Paid by Him to
Nat Raphael for
. ; ' \* Jewelry. .. -
The trial of the' suit of Colonel H. I.
Kowalsky against Nat Raphael to recover
$299 99 was on trial before Justice of the
Peace Dunn yesterday. The testimony
showed that Kowalsky executed six notes
for the future payment of a bill of jewelry
bought from Raphael. One of the notes,
for $285, was turned over to the Callornla
Jewelry Company by Raphael, who was
credited with cash to that amount, and
the company in turn gave the. note to
"Jake" Rauer for collection. Rauer re
covered judgment by default for $265, prin
cipal, and $115 interest, and levied on
money in bank belonging to Kowalsky. In
the meantime Kowalsky had compromised
on a settlement of the six notes, as he
thought, by paying $300 to Raphael, but
he afterward discovered that the judg
ment on the sixth note had been satisfied.
He accordingly sued to recover the money
paid to Raphael less 1 cent, to bring it
within the jurisdiction of the Justice's
Court. The case went over till Friday for
argument.; .-â¢-Â¦Â¦ ...

/SAN JOSE, .April 23.â James C. Dun
ham, the sextuple murderer of the Mc-
Glincy family at Campbell, is believed
to be in jail at Talledaga, Ala. This is
the opinion of Sheriff W. D. Mayo of Clay
County, Alabama, and, after viewing a
photograph of the suspect sent by Mayo,
the officials of . the Sheriff's office here
believe the same. The resemblance is so
striking that a man probably will be sent
from here to identify him.
A few weeks ago Sheriff Langf or i re
ceived a letter from Sheriff Mayo saying
he had a Dunham suspect under surveil
lance and asking for detailed information,
and photographs. . These were sent and
two more letters were received from.
Mayo, one arriving to-day containing a
photograph of the Dunham suspect,
Sheriff Mayo evidently became con
vinced to-day that he has Dunham under
arrest, for late to-night this message was
received from him: .
"Am confident I have Dunham in jail;
wire instructions."
Sheriff Langf ord instructed him Â¦ to hold
the man at any cost and procure photo
graphs in all the positions possible. * â¢
The photograph received this afternoon,
is an excellent likeness of murderer Dun
ham, or of his likenesses sent broadcast
by the thousands. The suspect had been
farming in a, sparsely settled section of
Clay County, Alabama, for several years,
"having made, his appearance there a few
mouths after the horrible crime at Camp
bell. He acted strangely and made no
friends. Lately he became communicative
and spoke of having lived in California
and the Santa Clara Valley. His appear
ance tallied with the description of Dun
ham, and closer investigation by .his
neighbors: led. to the conclusion that he
was the murderer. On the information
they gave to the Sheriff, he. was arrested
on a misdemeanor charge for the purpose
of holding him. Â¦Â¦â¢ â¢-
On January 26, 1856, Dunham killed the
McGlincy family, consisting- of his wife,
her father and mother, and brother, and
two hired men, at Campbell,' this county.
He escaped, and, "although $10,000 reward
was offered for his arrest, the capture has
not been made, unless this suspect should
prove the right one.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 23.â Plans are prac
tically perfected for the pooling of the
Business of the four American shipyards.
Those most directly. concerned In the deal
expected that an agreement would be
signed to-day. There has been delay,
which, however, is. of little consequence,
as the principals are all in full accord.
In the deal are the Union Iron Works
of San Francisco, the Bath Iron Works of
Bath, Me., the Newport News Ship
building and Drydocte Company of New
port News, Va., and the Crescent Ship
yards of Ellzabethport, N. J. Unfounded
rumors were afloat yesterday to the effect
that not fewer than a dozen shipyards
are to be brought into th*eombination with
the object of stifling competition. This,
however, those interested in the amalga
mation assert. Is absolutely without foun
dation. Competition will be courted
rather than evaded, and the men who
have the enterprise in charge will refuse
âand Indeed have refusedâ to widen its
scope.
This combination will bring together
Lewis Nixon of the Crescent Shipyards:
Edward W. Hyde, president of the Bath.
Iron Works; Calvin B. Orcutt. president
of the Newport News Shlp-bullding and
Drydock Company, and Irving M. Scott,
president of the Union Iron Works. The
Huntington estate will be largely Inter
ested 1 in the deal.
Limited to the four shipyards men
tioned, the combination will probably
form a working agreement with the
Cramps of Philadelphia, which will add
greatly to its strength and enable It to
carry out the purposes for which it ia
being brought into existence.
A rumor that is as yet unverified,
though generally believed, has It that
Naval Constructor Bowles will resign his
position' with the Navy Department In
Washington to become the executive head
of the shipyard combination. Bowles has
had- the position under consideration for
a week. __ â¢ .

INTO WONDERLAND OF RARE FLORA
But little concern la felt by the Polled
Department for that bunch of "thieve*
headed for this city, their eyes intent on
plunder." Nothing Is feared from the dep
redations of the "army of criminals,"
which the Examiner alleges "Is on its
way to gather epoll among crowds coming
to welcome the President."
â¢ Perhaps the most unfortunate compli
cation is that many of the leaders of this
most mysterious army are either dead or
in Jail. Police officials are not losing any
Bleep over their expected coming and are
not disposed to treat seriously the noti
fication received from railroad detectives
of their method of doing business.
Crooks of all classes and degrees do not
usually make public the announcement
of their route. Their press agents gener
ally get on the scene after the deed is
done. If they are dead - romantic tales
and previous records surround them with
a certain glamour. If in jail, it Is gener
ally hard for them to get, back to "the
old -Â«orld" their intentions as to future
movements, for the benefit of the gullible.
Some swallow the bait, especially when a
railroad detective is at the reel end of
So when Detective C. C. Crowley of the
Southern Pacific Company, announced
that this army was approaching San
Francisco, he hied himself to his ancient
archives, dug up copies of The Detective,
a weekly paper devoted to police news,
published in the East, got the records of
these crooks and his name into print at
the same time. One point was overlooked
by Crowley and his Examiner amanuen
sis 'Â¦ and that was keeping the. record up
to date.
If Crowley had simply announced that
All Baba and his forty thieves were com
ing to San Francisco his joke might have
been taken seriously. But he did not. In
stead, he placed in' the latter day class
photographs and pictures of the dead and
the imprisoned. Death cannot be avoided
and escape from penitentiaries is usually
difficult.
Take, for instance, the case of Richard
Preston, alias "Windy Dick." He is said
to be looked upon as a dangerous pick
pocket Unfortunately for "Windy Dick"
he. Is In Joliet Penitentiary, In Illinois,
and will not be given a parole in order to
enable him to visit San Francisco. â¢
Crook and Wife Both. Dead.
"Daniel Nugent, who has grown gray
picking pockets, and his alleged wife, Min
nie May, alias Daly, are easily at the top
of the criminal ladder," says the Exam
iner. Â¦ Â¦ . ' Â¦ â¢ â¢
Unfortunate, perhaps, it is for the two
that they cannot come with that army.
Perhaps both will -.turn uneasily in their
graves if they should know that "Danny
is Â¦ a 200-pounder and what is commonly
known as a 'stull' " as says the Exam
iner. Perhaps, -if the Examiner could
communicate through Nikola Tesla with
Mars, or some other suburban resort,
Danny and May might be here. But they
are in their graves.
â¢ Unfortunately again for the Examiner
and its pictures, James Jordan and
Charles A. Willis are at the penitentiary
at Deer Lodge, Mont. Chief of Police Sul
livan has not as yet telegraphed there to
know if they have got away, but is satis
fled that they rill stay there until the bal
ance of their long term is served. As a
companion 4 to these two. Bob Sherwood,
alias the "Gorilla," is also enjoying the
hospitality of the State of Montana with
the balance of a long sentence hanging
over him. There are others, too, in the
Examiner's list who are also In a state of
innocuous desuetude.
. "Crawley must have just been filling the
Examiner reporter with hot air, or trying
to make a flying machine out of him," re
marked Captain Seymour . yesterday.
"Why, half of these alleged notorious
crooks are dead, and the balance in jail.
They give us but little concern, especially
the dead and the jailed. From The Detec
tive one can get any old kind of a picture,
and the older the picture, is the better it
is. Crowley just gave the Examiner man
a large gold brick: ' If he is a detective,
he ought to know better than scare people
into the same condition as these dead and
jailed convicts." . ; .
Seymour Not Apprehensive.
Captain Seymour adds that the crowd
that will attend the President's reception
will probably be no larger than some oth-,
ers the Police "Department has handled,
and that the people need not go around
with their "hands on their pocketbooks."
The harvest that is likely to be reaped
will be of such small quantity that It will
be hardly worth considering.
Â¦ Through the medium of the Examiner it
is also announced that Henry Johnson,
Ed Williams and somebody's pal have ar
rived in town. Maybe they have; more
likely they have not, for at last accounts
all except the unknown pal were in East
ern penitentiaries. It is well for people to
lock their windows and keep their hands
on â¢their pockets while this army of crooks
is landed in this city, but the greatest
care should be observed regarding those
who are dead or in the penitentiary, for,
according to their published records, they
are the most dangerous of the lot.
Two Eastern crooks were apprehended
in this city at the Orpheum a few nights
ago. One who gave his name as Jo Green
is known in. the East as Harry A. Hud-
Bon, but his right name is Hudnall. He
came out to visit relatives in Oakland,
came over to the city, imbibed too freely,
and was caught. He had been shadowed
from the time of his arrival until his cap
ture. His companion, C. H. Merrill, Is
practically unknown, but has an Eastern
record that will be 'produced against him
on his trial. ' \ â¢ / % â¢

POSTUM CEREAL.
Is the subtle force which* controls the different organs of the
body. It makes them strong or weak, healthy or : diseased,
according #/ as the brain and nerves are strong and vigorous or
weak and diseased. Weak nerves cause headache, nervousness,
neuralgia, indigestion, Jjeart - trouble and many other forms "of
chronic weakness. Make 'the nerves strong, the brain clear and
active and the body will be healthy and vigorous.
"I was taken with a peculiar ailment that affected-
;>;- myneaaand my nerves were all nnstning. I was very
nervous, could not sleep and my mind was all confused. I
doctored for several weeks without getting better and

"It is a great pleasure to testify to
Postum that has made me a well woman
again. I have many friends here and in
other parts of the State who are using
Postum Food Coffee regularly, and I know
to their very ?reat benefit."
"For the past three years I have been a
perfectly strong, healthy woman, sleep
well, with good appetite, good color, active
and energetic.
"I took his advice at once and discon-
tinued medicines. Slowly the swelling dis-
appeared and the rheumatism left me,
the Blnking spells became less frequent,
and I got out of bed and around the
rouse. I was completely cured, but it re-
quired some time.
Mrs. Jeannette B. Brown, 100 Minor
street. Xew Haven, Conn., says: "Four
years ago my life hung on a very, slender
thread with liver, kidney and heart trou-
ble, and a %-ery severe form of rheuma-
tism. I was confined to bed with hands,
wrists, feet anl ankles bo badly swollen
that they bore no resemblance to parts of
the human body. I had frequent sinking
spells from heart weakness, when I was
thought to be dying and some times
thought to be dead. My doctor, one of the
directors of the State Hospital, a very
successful man in his profession, told me
to stop drinking coffee and use Postum
Food Coffee, as. he said coffee was the
primary" cause of my trouble.
When a woman Is brought to the edge
of the grave by poisoning from the' drink-
Ing of ordinary coffee day by day, and is
then made a well woman by leaving it
off, her experience Is worth something to
others that are poisoned In various ways
from the same habit.

The American Guaranty and Trust Co.â
Gentlemen: I have only recently returned
from a trip to Seattle and Tacoma. taken with
the specific purpose of Investigating the man-
agement and properties of the Montezuma Min-
ing Company. I must say your description doea
rot do Justice to the valuable copper and coal
properties you are developing. Your 1S0O acres
of coal lands could not be Improved upon for
maximum of results with minimum of expense,
since a great canyon divides the property, cut-
ting many veins of clear coal varying from S
ft 6 inches to 9 ft. 2 inches. (An 11 foot vein
has been opened since the writer's visit.) There
Is unlimited supply of wood and water. Tha
copper mines are being de^loped into valuabl*
properties-^the ore ranging from $40 to $300 a
The personnel of the directory I found second
to none, and as a result of my investigations I
unreservedly recommend "Monteiuma" as a
safe Investment. Respectfully yours,
A. M. AUBERTUS,

REPORT OF PROGRES3.
SEATTLE. "Wash.. April 5. 190L
Mr. J. S. C. Thompson, General Manager,
The American Guaranty and Trust Co.
My Dear Mr. Thompson: We had a Board
meeting yesterday and went Into matters f|UitÂ»
thoroughly. "We found everything In excellent
shape. Col. Thompson (President of the Monte-
zuma) somehow always does a little better
than he promises, and his report at this meet-
ins was no exception. We have authorized an
air compressor at the Tacoma mine, the pur-
chase of 160 acres of coal land adiDininz our
lease, and the improvement of tha Mowich trail
by which we save miles of distance. The com-
pany's books were examined, and we have
every reason to believe the affairs of the com-
pany are carried on with real economy and In
a thoroughly practical way. We were pleased
to find by examination of the bank book that
the company had a handsome credit balance
April 1. with not one cent of Indebtedness.
The "Tacoma" mine is Just now the center
of interest here. The treat vein of highly
mineralized stone has widened out from S ft. to'
9 ft., as reported to you a day or two ago. but.
better than all. the quality of the ore has im-
proved immensely. While the amount of oop-
per i3 uniformly maintained, the gold content
of the stone Is greatly Improving, showing hair
an ounce to an ounce of gold to a ton. Tha
silver values are fully maintained. It Is need-
less to say we are all extremely enthusiastic
over the great "Tacoma" mine. We believe it
la the best show on the Pacific Coast.
We have nothing mw from" the coal properties
since the uncovering of the 11 ft. vein a few
days ago. Our men are getting out coal evÂ«Â»ry
day. but this work cannot be pushed until the
fiume has been completed; then the flume is
contingent upon the construction of the saw-
mill, upon which effort" are now beina: directed.
As soon as the flume is done we shall be heard
of in the rlcht way at the coal mine* Yours
faithfully, E. m. SHDLTON.
Director Sheltcn will be at' our office Mon-
day and perhaps for several' days during the
weet. Shareholders and others are Invited to
call and -meet him.

Petitions in Insolvency.
Creditors of the Pacific Phosphate Com
pany of Alameda County petitioned the
United States District Court yesterday to
declare the firm, an involuntary insolvent.
The petition alleges that the company
owes Edward Barry $855, C. S. Goodman
$60 and E. C. Chapman $250, and that it
committed an act of insolvency by allow
ing A. B. Patrick &Co. to get judgment
against it for $308.
E. L. Moran, as an individual and as a
member of the extinct firm of Moran
Brothers of Santa' Cruz, has filed a peti
tion in insolvency. He owes $250 30 and has
no assets.
John B. Moisant, who is accused by R.
Dannmeyer, superintendent of the Crown
Distilleries Company, of having: purloined
bonds valued at $1200 and of kidnaping
his son, Stanley Moisant, is safe in Mex
ico. Yesterday evening Captain Seymour,
chief of detectives, received the following
dispatch from El Paso, Tex.:
Moisant left train at Smelter, Tez. Men are
across Rio Grande River looking: for him.
J. H. WHITE," Chief of Police.
Captain Seymour places little faith in
the charge of felony embezzlement sworn
to by Dannmeyer, but was obliged to take
steps to arrest Moisant after a warrant
had been Issued by Judge "Cabaniss. The
friends of Moisant declare that Dann
meyer Is assisting Mrs. Moisant to get her
husband within the jurisdiction of Cali
fornia In order that he might be served
with divorce papers. Â¦ â¢ ..
Investigation showed yesterday that on
February 8 Mrs. Moisant filed suit in the
Superior Court for divorce, alleging ex
treme cruelty and asking for alimony in
the sum of $200 per month. Attorney
O'Callaghan is the lawyer for Mrs. Moi
sant. He also acted for Dannmeyer in the
proceedings charging Moisant with felony
embezzlement. Dannmeyer positively re
fuses to give the address of Mrs. Moisant
to the police, and Attorney O'Callaghan
claims that he does not know where she
is living. It is known, however, that Mrs.
Moisant is residing with her mother In
this city and in the past few days has
consulted Dannmeyer, who is her uncle,
and has also visited her attorney's office.
Ridicules Charge of Felony.
A well-known attorney, who Is a friend
of Moisant, said yesterday: "If Moisant
comes back here he will do so of his own
free will, and I will probably act for him.
This story of felony emb^zlement is all
bosh. Moisant has not stolen'any bonds
of Dannmeyer* and he has not kidnaped
his child. His wife refused to live in the
Republic of Salvador with him and Moi
sant has kept her well supplied with
money. He sent her $200 last January, and
on February 8 she filed suit for divorce.
She charged him with extreme cruelty and
asks for $200 per month alimony.
"Judge Sloss made an order on the day
the suit was filed that publication be made
of the suit in the Recorder, as the best
paper likely to give Moisant notice of the
action. Moisant read of the suit in The
Call and came back from Salvador this
month. His wife did not mention her suit
when her husband called on her, but he
kept posted as to her intentions. When
he found that her attorney Intended to
serve the divorce papers on him he made
preparations to go back to Salvador and
told his friends so. He took his little boy
with him, as he is devotedly attached to
the child. Moisant has interests in salt
mines in Salvador and wants his wife to
live there with him. She tried it for a time
and then came back to San Francisco.
"If Mrs. Moisant wanted to have her
husband arrested for kidnaping her child
she would certainly not have kept in hid
ing, neither would her attorney and rela
tives keep her address secret."
Divorce Filed in February Last.
The records of the County Clerk's office
show that Mrs. Moisant filed suit for di
vorce from her husband on February 8, as
stated above, and asked for alimony In
the sum of $200 per month, counsel fees
and the custory of the child, Stanley Moi
sant.
The little town of Smelter, Tex., where
Moisant left the train on Monday night,
Is a few miles west of El Paso and close
to the Mexican border. Moisant would
have but little trouble in reaching the
Mexican Central Railroad and continuing
his journey to Salvador. He resides in the
town of Soustani in the Central American
republic, where he located in 1896, a year
after his marriage.
If Dannmeyer desires to bring Moisant
back to this city and to press the charge
of felony embezzlement, it will be a mat
ter of extradition by the Federal Govern
ment through the Secretary of State. .

Felice Cozrmisisoners Refuse to Issue
Licenses to Old-Established Places
or Consider New Applications.
Seven more saloonkeepers in the vicin
ity of the Presidio were denied licenses
Ia6t night by order of the Police Commls-
BionerB. There were a number of appli
cations for new licenses and, pursuing the
policy heretofore outlined, these were also
refused. The case of Weinhold, one of
those who was denied a license, is of in
terest from the fact that the saloon he is
at present conducting near the Presidio
gate has been open for ' forty-six vpÂ» rg.
but must now close its doors. Mrs. i\iary
Powers made a pathetic appeal to con
tinue her business, backed by a long peti
tion signed by many residents in the vicin
ity. She was given a week's time to find
a new location. All others received scant
consideration. Edward Olsen, who owns
a piece of property on Baker and Green
wich streets, wanted a license which was
denied. Licenses in other sections of the
city were freely granted.

"Lrotta," the famous actress of the
American stage, is sojourning in Belve
dere, having arrived on the overland train
from the East on Monday night.
In a quiet and unostentatious manner
"Lotta," or Miss Carlotta Crabtree, left
the train at Oakland on the night of her
arrival and yesterday morning went to
Belvedere to visit friends.
It is some years' since the talented little
lady, who has made millions laugh, was
in California, where she made the start In
her career that has brought her fame and
fortune. "Lotta" is reputed to be worth
$3,000,000, the bulk of which is invested in
giltedge real estate.
Miss Crabtree .was born. In. New Tork
City on November 7. 1847, her father be
ing a bookseller on Nassau street. When
the discovery of gold in this State was
heralded to the world Mr. Crabtree
crossed the plains with his family to Cal
ifornia. He did not get rich and his wife
Joined a variety company which was
touring the State. Her daughter, when
eleven years old, appeared at Petaluma
as Gertrude in "The Loan of a Lover"
and scored a big success. In the theaters
of San Francisco little "Lotta" became a
great favorite and the hardy miners
showered gold nuggets on the footlight
favorite. It was not uncommon for "Lot
ta" to pick up $1000 worth of nuggets and
gold dust during an evening's perform
ance.
In 1S64 she went to New Tork and ap
peared* in spectacular productions and
when she played in "Little Nell" and "The

struck Sylva and the fight was on. Every
person in the courtroom took a hand in
the affair and numerous bruises on the
heads and faces of the belligerents were
the result. Â¦
Miss Crabtree is accompanied by her
mother and says her visit to California is
for the purpose of benefiting her parent's
health.
Marchioness" Gothamites -were aware
that a genius was in their midst. In all
cities where she played "Lotta" became
the pet of the people and she accumu
lated riches quickly. She played in "Top

"Zip." "Bob" and "The Little Detective,"
ail of which were written to suit her in
imitable talents.

Kearny and Geary streets which "Lotta"
presented to the people of San Francisco
is a memento of the . love she bears the

should she consent to reappear before the
footlights it is safe to say that "standing
room only" would be at a premium.
"LOTTA," THE FAMOUS ACTRESS, AGAIN
VISITS SCENES OF EARLY TRIUMPHS
Millionaire "Bill" Bradbury is again in
trouble, brought about, it is claimed in a
suit filed yesterday against him by A. G.
Carswell andAl A. Carothers', by actions
on his part fully as accentrlc as any. others
that have lately, brought him into notor
iety. Carswell and Carothers have, been
conducting ths apartment. house at 1401
Van Ness avenue, which is owned by
Bradbury, but -they- claim he has broken
up their business, for which they demand
?15,000 damages. " , ' .
They say that shortly, after they took
the house, in January last,- Bradbury/ as
sisted by one Daniel O'Connor,^ for the
purpose of compelling the plaintiffs to va
cate the premises, began to create loud and
peculiar disturbances around the house
and make noise enough for a boiler fac
tory. I Not â¢ satisfied that this conduct
would have the desired effect, the plain
tiffs say Bradbury and O'Connor would
stand on the street and ogle at guests of
the house, annoy them In other ways and
again attempt to intimidate them. This
conduct finally broke up their business,
the plaintiffs claim, and hence they de
mand judgment as stated. â¢' . ..Â¦>Â¦-
Bradbury will have another trouble, on
his mind to-day. A warrant was sworn
out yesterday charging him with railing
to put proper plumbing into a building at
the corner of Van Ness avenue and Cali
fornia street, owned by him. He will be
arrested this morning.

\f~^ EORGE E. WHITE, the "Round
ft yj-. Valley Cattle .King," has deserted
11 I his young and pretty wife, Louise,
and sho has instituted suit for
absolute divorce. Mrs. White filed
her suit yesterday afternoon, alleging de
sertion as cause of action. While Mrs.
White is preparing her case, her aged
husband, who, through the advice of spir- '
its, it is said, is about to emerge from his
third matrimonial venture, is marshaling
his force ! about his purse, which is a
large one, 'and bis force has responded to
the call with avidity. The fact that. he is
about to. lose his wife is not particularly
displeasing to him, for the voice from the
spirit world, .which he says led him to the
altar, has again whispered its advice, and
this advice has robbed his wife of his love.\
His Third Venture.
Many years r.go White- took unto him
self a wife. Not long after the wedding
she died and for some time the aged cap
italist lived alone. Finally he married his
niece, but this marriage proved -to be un
happy. A decree of divorce was procured
by the second Mrs. White and the fight
for his property began. He refused. to
heed the various orders for the payment
of alimony issued by the court and finally
he was thrown into jail for contempt.
Then he decided to compromise and, after
freeing himself from jail and all demands
of the second Mrs. White, he returned to
his Round Valley home. Soon he became
lonesome and decided to again marry. The
spirits had always. advised him well in
business, so to their " mystic forms he
poured â¢- out â¢ his confession that . all he
needed to make him happy was some one
to love. The spirits hearkened to his story
and pointed to the path that leads to J.

Benjamin's marriage bureau. The fact
that White was looking for a wife was
circulated by the industrious Benjamin,
but among all that sought his hand there
was but one for him, then Miss Louise
Bogan, who re3lded at S10 Tehama street.
Miss Bogan had known her aged suitor
but a short time when the wedding was
arranged. He was an ardent lover and an
energetic man tor his years. His beard
was kept a shining- black with a liberal
use of aye, and. in the fire of his love he
strutted about with all the vigor of a
youth. His . blazing diamonds and fre
quent and costly presents captivated the
young lady, and when a wedding trous
seau was suggested the aged lover looked
to it. The bride stood beside him before
the minister in a rustling white silk gown,
which showed her pretty figure to ad
vantage.- Rev.- Dr. Cryor, the pastor of
the Westminster Presbyterian Church,
performed the ceremony on February 16,
1898.:
Miss Anna Hannon was the bridesmaid,
and the maid of honor was Miss Kate
Elphinston. John P. Bogan, the brother
of the bride, supported the groom. Only a
few friends of the bride were present at
the ceremony. There was a breakfast af
ter the ceremony had been performed and
then the newly married couple took the
train for Los Angeles. They toured
around the southern part of the State for
a time, crossed over into Mexico and then
came home.

SUDDEN DEATH COMES
TO THEODORE SMITH
Mrs. "White knew ot her husband's
wealth and as she, a pretty girl of 22, had
given up her life, as she then thought, to
a man past 70 and whose whiskers, in the
vernacular of the street, were palntSd,
she believed it only right to raise her liv
ing expenses to an amount commensurate
with her station In life. She hence pur
chased? a set of furniture and here the
row, began. "White could see no object in
purchasing furniture. Then spirits whis
pered more advice. They pointed out that
Mrs. .White was extravagant, that she
had started on the trail that leads to
financial ruin. So finally, Mrs. "White al
leges, her husband deserted her and hence
she demands a decree of divorce. In ad
dition to a divorce, Mrs. White asks for
alimony in the sum of $150 a month and a
judgment for counsel fees and costs of
action.- It is Mrs. White's prayer for ali
mony against which White will make his
fight, though his last attempt to evade
the process <of court may yet be fresh in
his memory, and have- a Â¦ quieting effect
upon his combative instinct, .which is al
ways awakened when money is the issue.
