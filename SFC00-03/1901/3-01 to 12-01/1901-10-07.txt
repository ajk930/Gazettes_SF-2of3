Samrjson's Friends Disturbed.
Rear ' Admiral Sampson's friends are
more disturbed over General Alger'a re
flections than either the President or Gen
eral Miles. Rear Admiral Sampson him
self could not be seen, but an officer of
service, who is familiar with the reasons
for the various maneuvers which Samp
son executed, said to-night:
â¢ "The task. before-. Rear Admiral Sampson
was to prevent the escape of the Spanish
squadron. v The vessels comprising that
squadron were rated as armored cruisers
of high speed, and, had they left Santiago,
coaled, and provisioned, they could have
steamed along. the American. coast, caus
ing the wildest alarm,- and. perhaps, some
damage. The decision of the admiral that
a vessel-should be sunk in the channel of
the. harbor at Santiago- was concurred In
by the Naval Board and was considered
good tactics by the Navy Department and
approved by the President. The admiral
sent .the collier Sterling, to join Schley.
giving. the latter instructions to sink the
collier across the channel.
" 'The Importance of absolutely prevent
ing the escape of the Spanish squadron,'
Admiral Sampson said at the time, 'la so
paramount that the promptest and most
efficient use of every means is demand

MURDEROUS ATTACKS MADE
UPON WOMEN AND GIRLS
Several Victims of the Unknown As
sailants Are Now at the Point
of. Death.
PUEBLO, Colo., Oct. 6.â This city Is in
great excitement over a series of murder
ous assaults upon women and girls. From
what can be learned they seem to have
been committed by the same person, a
negro or a very dark white man with his
face blacked. Last night Mrs. James P.
Henderson was a victim, being half killed
with a club while alone In her home, the'
assailant having induced her to admit
him by pretending he had a telegram. He
stole a revolver when he departed.
Later a girl in a family named Hamilton
was terribly choked by a man who had
forced his way in. He left on the bed
where the girl had been -stopping the same
revolver stolen at the other place.
Mrs. Hickey, who was struck down
while riding a bicycle two nights ago, is
still at the point of death with a fractured
skull and can give no clear account of
what happened. Two very young girls
had recently been victims of assaults of
the most atrocious description. In another
case a negro who seized a young lady on
the porch of her home was chased two
blocks by a young man. but escaped.
The police have been unable to get any
definite Information. Report comes late
to-night of another case, which is now be
ing Investigated.

turn the trick. Monsoon did not show
anything particularly promising in -the
first two rounds, although he won- his
courses with something to spare. War

Los Angeles sent Kihm and Reitz home

It is certain, at any rate, that the
petition bears the names of many promi
nent members of the Municipal League,
who are in honor bound to support the
candidate of that league. General L.
Tozer, whether they desire to or not.
General Tozer makes public declaration
of his belief that many members of that
league are insincere and will not support
the league's candidates. That there Is
considerable disaffection In' the body is
known, since, at a meeting held the other
night, there was a close vote on the
proposition of withdrawing the ticket
from the field altogether. A member of
the league said to-day that he was in
favor of Clark and he did not care who
knew it. He added that the league was
formed not for the purpose of nominating
a Mayor, but to support business men
for Trustees who would intelligently and
honestly handle the hundreds of thou
sands ' of dollars to be expended in the
next year in public improvements. He
declared that General Tozer was divert
ing the league from its purpose in stand-
Ing in for election for Mayor.
There is* talk that vast sums of money
will be placed in the campaign in the
Interests of Clark, independent, and Land,
Republican. Both â¢ are wealthy, and
neither is a man who will let a few
dollars stand in the way of victory.
Tents are to be erected in various parts
of the city and spellbinders are to be
engaged -on all sides. . \u25a0
The unique figure in the campaign \u25a0 is
James H. Devine, the Democratic candi
date. Asked when he was going to open
his "sack," Devine told an importunate
voter, "My jawbone's my sack," and the
remark supplies, the keynote of his can
vass. His placards call upon citizens to
"vote for James H. Devine for Mayor,
and you vote against hypocrisy and false
promises in political life."
Devine, who is a Trustee, has 'acquired
fame as an orator and pamphleteer, and
has never been mixed up In the scandals
which have been charged against the
municipal board from time to time.
Although the Democrats are in the
minority, the division in the Republican
ranks has led many to declare that
Devine is a big- factor in the fight and
may win out.
Clark has the whole municipal adminis
tration working for him, and this is
of course a big advantage in his favor.
Against him is arrayed the power of
Colonel J. B. Wright and the entire Re
publican organization. Upon the success
of the Republican efforts depends the
ascendency of the ruling faction in local
politics, and Clark will have the race of
his life. He knows it, and is doing some
clever campaigning. All of the news
papers - are against him. and if he wins
it will be largely on account of personal
popularity.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 6.-Never in the
history of the city has there been such
an interesting Mayoralty contest as the
present one. There are five candidates
in the field, and there is no telling what
will result from the general split-up.
George H. Clark, the incumbent, has not
yet filed his petition to be placed on the
ticket as an independent candidate, and
he will not need to do so, under the law,
for ten days yet. Meanwhile his friends
are circulating the document, and their
boast is that it will contain the names of
half the registered voters in the city.
This, however, is regarded as a bit of
hyperbole excusable in the heat of the
campaign.
They will leave Poplar Point at 3 p. m
Tuesday, reaching Winnipeg at 4 p ro.
Sir Wilfrid Laurler left the party a!t
Winnipeg and will remain there until
Tuesday as the guest of Lieutenant Gov
ernor McMillan and Sir Wilson.
BANFF. N. W T Oct. 6.-The Duchess
of Cornwall and York left here at 9
o'clock to-night for Poplar Point, where
on Tuesday she will rejoin the Duke
This morning, in company with the
Countess Milo, she attended special ser
vice and later drove to Devils Lake and
the buffalo and elk paddock in the Na
tional Park. She also visited the geyser
caves and sulphur pools. She was so
greatly interested in the rocks that she
purchased a collection of paintings of
them and carried away a large number
c* souvenirs. The entire local population
was at the station when the royal special
pulled out, and when the Duchess was
leaving they pave a' hearty cheer.
Shortly after the arrival at the lodge
dinner was served and the remainder of
the day was spent in a quiet inspection
of the lodge and its surroundings. The
party will remain at this shooting box
until Tuesday and will in that time have
plenty of opportunity of securing a large
bag of game..
POPLAR Point, Oct., 6.â The royal
train conveying the Duke of Cornwall
and York and suite arrived here about 11
o'clock this morning and was received by
Senator Kirchhoffer and Lord Minto,
Governor General of Canada, who had
arrived to meet tne party. The dis
tinguished guests are in excellent spirits
and looking forward with great antici
pc/ion to the enjoyment of the shooting
at Lake Manitoba. The shooting party
consists of the Duke, Prince Alexander
of Teck, Lord Crichton, Commander
Geoffrey Fossett, Sir Charles Cust and
Major Maude.
After luncheon Senator Kirchhoffer and
his guests drove out to the lake. On
arrival at the landing a fleet of canoes
was waiting to convey the guests to the
shooting lodge, which is a five mile
paddle across the marsh slough. The
canoe conveying the Duke was guided by
John Atkinson, premier guide of Lake
Manitoba shooting grounds, with Lord
Minto in the bow, the other boats form
ing a 'fleet of honor. The party reached
the shooting lodge about 5 o'clock.
Elaborate preparations had been made
for their entertainment there, which
highly delighted the guests. .The country
is wild in the extreme, but the site
selected for the shooting lodge Is an ideal
spot and has the appearance of a shoot
inr box. Outbuildings and a group of
tents made a very pretty picture. The
weather is perfect, and as game birds.,
particularly ducks, are plentiful, there
are prospects of a splendid outing. All
the shooting will be done from canoes,
and the sportsmen will be on hand in
good time in the morning to catch the
early flight of the birds. \u25a0

SAN JOSE, Oct. 6.â George Stiff, an em
ploye of Sunset Telephone Company, had
a thrilling experience "yesterday, and. at
the same time a narrow escape from hav
ing his brain battered out by a horse that
had fallen into a manhole. Stiff, with
other workmen, was engaged in splicing
two telephone cables on South First
street. He was at work in the manhole
when a shying horse jumped and both its
fore feet landed In the hole. The aper
ture was just big enough to allow its
legs to enter and the animal rested on
its neck and shoulder. . . . . .
Stiff was compelled to dodge the horse a
hoofs, which beat a steady tattoo against
the side of the aperture. After fifteen
minutes the horse was raised by means of
a pulley and rope and Stiff was dragged
out of the hole in an exhausted condition.
Stiff declared the fifteen minutes he spent
dodging the horse's hoofs seemed like a
century.

There was a period of calm last night
at the New York Yacht Club house. Talk
of models and boats had come to a close.
The proposed reception planned In honor
of Sir Thomas Lipton and to be held on
Tuesday night will be well attended.
These words of the owner of the chal
lenger were heard with much interest at
the New York Yacht Club. The members
have already begun to speculate as to
what kind of a boat he will bring to try
again for America's cup. .
It is reported by cable that the Emperor
of Germany is' considering; the matter -of

- LONDON, Oct. 7.â A fairly well attend

day in a hall in Tottenham Court Road,
London, to hear a lecture on the assassi
nation of President McKinley by R. Kelly
of New York. The audience, largely com
posed of foreigners, applauded all refer

torious" act. The speakers Included En
rico Malatesta, the Italian anarchist,
who described the assassination as "a
deed of heroism."
Kelly's lecture was a mild harangue
in denunciation of McKiniey's political ca

to justify assassination, but rather to ex
plain it as the outcome of "the oppression
of workmen by capital."

Bodies of iron ore are also located on
Dibble Creek, a tributary of Bull River.
Ten locations have been made in this
vicinity. A prospecting party from Wild
Horse Creek reports the finding of a
large deposit of iron on the east fork.
On Grundy Creek an eight-foot ledge has
been located. In the vicinity of Moyle
iron has been found, including large iron
deposits at Kltchrner. Not less than
eighty iron locations have been made in
the Kootenai district during August and
September.
This large body of iron has been traced
from the Bull River side of the mountain
over the summit down Into Iron Creek
and up Munroe Mountain, a total distance
of 4000 feet. . Fourteen claims have been
located in almost a straight line and sur
face indications show the big- lead, as far
as known, to be 21.000 feet long. The ore
deposit is covered by thirty-three loca
tions.
TACOMA. Wash., Oct. 6.â It has just
become known that during: the past
month numerous large ledges of iron ore
have been uncovered in the Fort Steele
district of British Columbia. Mining: men
say these discoveries will provide suffi
cient Iron to permit a full development of
the iron and eteel industries on the Pa
cific Coast. :
At Bull River there are great masses
of red hematite lying exposed on the side
of the mountain- Three ledges have been
uncovered, one of which has a width of
fifty feet, showing a depth of 300 feet
by- reason of an open cut extending: for
that distance up and down' the mountain
side. The ore is said to be a first class
bessemer ore, carrying about 63 per cent
metallic iron. .

ROME, Oct. 6: â An Austrian anarchist named Glavenovich was arrested to-day while loit
ering about the Vatican. It is reported he was aiming to murder the Pope and Cardinal
Rampolla. He carried a razor.
The suspect was heard to threaten the lives of Pope Leo and Cardinal Rampolla. Bos
chieri, another anarcHist has been arrested in Milan.
NEW YORK, Oct. 6. â One thousand alleged anarchists assembled in a hall on Fourth
street in this city to-night, ostensibly to hold a ball in honor of the organization of the Frei-
Arbeiter Stemme, said to be a society composed of anarchists, but the nature of the assemblage
was suspected by the manager of the hall and in a short time forty policemen were on the scene.
The manager learned that the meeting was really planned to hear Johann Most make a speech,
but Most, while on his way to the hall, was warned away by members of the society who were
sent out to head him off when the police arrived. The presence of the police prevented any
speechmaking.

W. R. Butler's Address:
William R. Butler of Mauch Chunk, Pa.,'
mlAj , the pews crowded, . the
aisles congested and the altar
steps lined with children,
Trinity Church presented a
novel scene yesterday after
noon during the missionary
service of the United Episco
palian Sunday' schools. From all the
churches of that denomination the chil
dren gathered . on Gough street, near
Bush, and in rank formation marched
Into the church, the banners alone mark
ing the distinction of congregation.
The procession of children fell in line
after the dignitaries of the church, led by
Bishops Ferguson, Hare and Nichols.
Then came the choir and other church of
ficers. Down the main -aisle to the altar
and then dividing the Sunday school chil
dren filled pew after pew. To the right
were seated the Maria Kip Orphanage
girls, noticeable for their white caps and
their white collars. Interspersed in the
rows upon rows of children were their
teachers, and further back and in the gal
leries were adult spectators.'
The services consisted of addresses by
well-known divines and missionaries and
Missionary Services for United Sunday-
School Children fire Impressive.
He spoke of the coming of the Redeemer,
and picturing the events from his coming
until the great shadow fell on Mount Cal
vary. The coming: of the Redeemer and
all the subsequent events were but the
fulfillment of the revelation, which Bishop
Graf ton said came with the singing of the
angels of the babe who was born in Beth
lehem. Then the revelation was. created.
With it came not only truth, but eternal
wisdom. He continued:
As we watch our blessed Lord and listen to
his parables we are gazing Into the depths of
divine -light. We are finding the Justice, good
ness and love given him by his father, and he
reveals man to himself. Truth had been
spoken in various ways by philosophers but
as man began to look at himself in the mirror
of divine light ha recognized how weak, how
degraded and how stained he was. But out
of it all he found he had a destiny greater than
the angels, far beyond the dreams of poets far
beyond the dreams of philosophers, Man's
destiny reaches to the realms of heaven and
God. Man was made far God and was to have
his home with God.
It all means the union of the soul with God
What Is it? We may gain or miss it for
alas! in time all evil will be destroyed and
goodness will : triumph.
Those who gain will be gathered Into divine
light and those who miss it will gin no more
The day of grace will be over. God will
triumph. Goodness will triumph. They can't
sin because grace will have been withdrawn
All this opens a tremendous destiny to us
a marvelous destiny. This goodness of God Is
so marvelous that angels look upon us - with
wondÂ«r. That man- could be so foolish, so un
grateful, so weak, so wicked to lose all ls a
problem. . . â¢
If. you die outside- of the church -you cannot
approach the seat of judgment and cry for
mercy. You have rejected it

HAVE NO RIGHT
TO DO WRONG
The Right Rev. Joseph' M. Francis. B.
The master has been proclaimed as king
throughout all the agee. He has been ac
knowledged master of the world by the greatest
men of all the ages. The greatest materialist
in Europe has said that Christ was more- than
man. He has said that Christ was the corner
stone of a mighty structure, the removal of
which would cause the superstructure to fall
In ruins. To him we owe allegiance and faith.
To him we owe our hope of Immortality. When
we enter into the decline of life, and the shad
ows of the coming end cast themselves upon
us, we will look forward to the time when we
appear before the master with exultation and
rapture. Let this be our prayer
and. granting them peace, tells them to go and
sin no mere. Through all the ages the noblest
and purest thoughts of men have had their
origin in this divine interposition In the af
fairs of mortal beings. Is It not true of us
that there is within us a little spot In which
we dwell Jn utter loneliness, where the hear ( t
yearns for sympathy, and seeks for something
but finds It not? It iÂ» the working of the mas
ter, impelling us to the performance of noble
things, so that our heritage may be noble. - Men
have always felt that there ls . another world
lying about us, and to the border line of which
we seem to be going. Then comes ChrUt and
carries Us across the border' line out ,lnto the
opening. We seem to hear the music of his
voice and catch a passing glimpse of his an
gelic face, transfigured and holy. Belief In him
will deprive us of fear, and belief in him will
render our nppearance before the master a
cause for rejoicing rather than fear.
Human llfe.Js not free. In spite of our Macna
Charta claims It cannot be free, except with
that freedom which is granted by the master
before whom we must all stand. Freedom
eourht In one field too often proves bondage in
toother. Freedom tb*t is not found la the
Freedom is like a fire, which, kept within
proper bounds, is a useful servant of man;
but when it grows beyond control it becomes
most dangerous and destructive. In some - of
our hearts this fire Is burning and rapidly be
coming a conflagration. You often hear young
men in all walks of life, some college-bred and
of rood social standing, say that so long an
they do not tranngress the limitations and
boundaries set by law, that they should be per
mitted to do as they please. Am I not sover
eign, lord and master? What shall hinder me
In the Dursult of my desires? Public ojÂ«lnlon?
It will not hear of my secret indulgences. Re
ligion? I am religious and devout. The Bible?
It has been laid on the shelf long ago. Verily,
the old traditions, sanctities and sanctions are
getting beyond control. There is too much free
dom in deportment, too much freedom in de
meanor and raiment, too much freedom of
speech. We see on the part of many a disposit
tion to thrust aside that which seems to check
the free Indulgence and gratification of our
vhims and desires.
Freedom Lil^e a Fire.
As this man who stood before his master.
bo must we all stand before our master; that
master from whom no secrets may be hidden
In this world great struggles are constantly go
ing on; struggles toward repudiation of owner
ehlp of life, struggles which In this field of ac
tion are now felt as never before. Men are
eeeking by many means to attain freedom of
pelf. In national life, Jn the field of politics
by legislative enactments, by bullets and bal
lot*, are they seeking to enlarge their scope,
bulk, power and dominion; and above all, their
freedom from sovereignty and possession.

to a suggestion from' Henry M. Stanley. â¢ the-
Propagation of the Gospel. - Trvo years after
this society was founded It was seen that, the
field to be covered was much too large for
It, so another organization, designated a3 the
Missionary Society, was started. Both are in
existence to-day and have accomplished much
for the cause of Christianity and will accom
plish much more.
Durlnpr the first 100 years after the establish
ing of these societies, be it said to the shame
of England, but little headway was made.
The English did not have uny faith In the
work and did not come forward and support
it the way it deserved to be supported.
Even in India tfwre was not a single mis
sionary from England until the close of the
eighteenth century. By the laws then pre
vailing that large dependency of the crown
was closed to missionaries. In 1S13, by an act
of Parliament, this impediment was removed
and the territory was thrown open to the ener
gies of the missionaries from the English
church. The first workers in the field were

from Honolulu, via Victoria, to at
tend the convention and is at the
Palace. He went to Honolulu in 1872 from
England and was appointed by the Arch
bishop of Canterbury. At that time the
church was known as the Reformed
Catholic church and he changed the title
to the Anglo Church of Hawaii. . Among
the important matters to be discussed at
the present convention is the question
whether the church in Hawaii shall be
come a branch of the Episcopal Church
of America,

religion, and the misery of Solomon after he
para it up makes a picture we do not like to

future life, and he received the first Intima

God took th* sufstance cf his manhood from

womanhood the greatest and most glorious
rrown of motherhood. The greatest problem

in religion, the divin* Jmminenc* of God.
The new chancel of the church was
formally opened at. thfi morning services
by Bishop Nichols. The sermon was
preached by Bishop Tuttle of Missouri.
Religious feeling was in early days a con
r^lcuous feature of the life of Solomon. He

had an idea of a vindicator, who would re-
Uerr him of his personal ills. This was real

und his property, but ho failed to grasp the
ilna. cf a future state. This Idea might find
a. reacy response in the hearts of many con
gregations, but is ths lowest level of religion.
\u25a0When Moses led his people out of thÂ« wil
demees he brought them to a realization of
their present condition. They were full only
of the idea c* present preservation. God in
tended this as an example. There Is no record
In the five books of Moses of any hope of a
future life. And so, too, we may continue
through the lives of Abraham and Jacob. In
those days religion lay In the lower levels. It
dwelt not with the future state, the greatest
solace of our religion of to-day.

Proof of Immortality.
It was given to Greece to show in the came

through the ages.
The Chinese, despite their stoicism and be
lief in the doctrines of Confucius, are the
eacred guardians of the Fifth Commandment.
"Honor thy father and thy mother." This
fundcjnental principle, respect of parents, is
apparent all through their belief, so we are
bound to think it was given to them as a
religious heritage.
Mj- friends, let us keep the second com

There 1* a way of detecting all Idolaters.
Watch a man on Sunday if you would decide
whether lit is a worshiper of idols. A man
on Sunday does what he likes and on week
Uays he does what he is compelled to do. On
Sunday every man worships. If he does not
worol:!;i God he worships idols. The idolater's
day Is devoted to his eating, his drinking, ii.s
riÂ«w>r.teg end to his play. His Sunday is no
â¢JiMereM from that of his horse. Some of our
American mÂ«n raise such a high plane that
'lif-y. like the animals in the Dark, devote
theii time to the lofty ideal of keeping them
selves in a etate of perfect physical comfort.
Idolatry means decay. If any one believes
that thÂ« civilization of the American people â
l>e it ever so strong â can stand against the
erwrvattng force of idolatry he lias, totally
ignored all the history of the nations of the
pasu This is a universe which permits the
rurvival of only the fittest. The idolater who
<1r*s r.ot devote his Sundays to communion
v.v.h God is not enrolling himself in the ranks
of the fittest. A lifetime of idolatry will turn
h'm out a demon and thus he will enter the
domain of the great hereafter.
Idolatry on Sunday,
Idcl vcrEfcip of some descriptions evaocs t'e

those who labor for a salary as well as among
those who receive dividends. The whole creed
and object of existence of some people is their
income. If you take away their income you
take OHty their title of manhoodâ you take
av.-ay their god of Idolatry.
In his sermon at the evening service
the Rev. John Henry Hopkins spoke ie
substance as follows:
The stringent provisions contained In the
EiMe tujoininjj all Christians against the wor
ship of idols appears to the people of to-day
to be absolutely inapplicable and incongruous.
The average man's conception of an idol is
that of a hideous image set up in a niche

Scripture abounds with commands a&tUi:5t 'del

BISHOP GBJFTOII DISCOURSES UPOH THE REVELATION ASD DESTINY
Paul's words have still a wider Interpreta
tion. They not only include the forgetting of
sins, but also a forgetting of the good deeds
that are done. In the past, if we have per
formed charities they must be put behind.
I have heard many Christians boasting of what
they had done. Even sometimes the little
deeds that" were done' were magnified and of
fered as an excuse for not doing more in the
living present. I know of nothing more dead-'
enlng than to keep your own goodness before
your eyes. If you are growing in grace,- your
past goodness will not satisfy you. A good
past should be the basis of a bountiful harvest
of good deeds in the future. -
Forgetting the deeds that are done is the
negative 6ide of a Christian life. Reaching for
those things which are before Is the positive
side of Christianity. Keep your eyes to the
front. Do not look upon the deeds that are
done. Turning back may be the ruin of a
noble life. Remember Lot's wife. She turned
hack and paid a grievous penalty. There is no
standing still in a Christian's life. One duty
follows another as night does day.
The Rev. John Sca.-borough, Bishop of
the diocese of New Jersey, nlledthe pul
pit of the Rev. John Bakewell at Trinity
Episcopal Church this morning. His text
was, "This one thing I do, forgetting
those things which are behind and reach
ing for those things which are before. I
press toward the mark for the prize of
the high calling of God," from the epistle
of Paul to the Philippians. He spoke in
part as follows: .
Who does not feel ashamed in the presence of
such an example as St. Paul has set? In
comparison, even the most worthy of us 1 to
day eink into insignificance when our energies
are -compared to the unflagging zeal and con
tinual pressing forward of Paul. He ever for
got the eood deeds .that he had done. Ht
forgot 'those thinjrs which were, behind and
reached forward for those things which are
before.
AVhat does he mean by saying â¢ "forgetting
those things which are behind?" Did he mean
to forget merely that he was a Jew? Or djd
he have a deeper and spiritual significance at
tached to his words? I think he meant that
we -are privileged to forget our, sins and trans
gressions. Nay. more than this, it is our
bounden duty to do so. It is folly, it is worse
ttÂ»an folly to dwell upon the past and its sins.
Such contemplation cannot result In any good.
The Creed teaches us daily to 6ay "I believe
In the forgiveness of sins." The apostle's
words makes it necessary that we forget the
eins that are behind and fix our eyes upon the
things which are before.

You and I have probably heard people say
that their circumstances were such that they

Right Rev. S. C. Edsall. D. D.. Bishop
of Minnesota, delivered the sermon at the
evening service in St"Utuck Hall, saytng-
The sacrificial death of our martyr Presi
dent has brought to the minds of the American
people the outpouring of the spirit of God upon
them. In a time of prosperity, when men had
all they needed, when there was an abundance
of material things, there was a danger that
the American people should forget their God;
there was a danger of growing cynicism and
irreverence among them. ~ In this time of great
prosperity, and where there was a danger oC
the forgetting of God. there rings out a shot
heard throughout this country. A man, the
very embodiment of God. Is stricken down as
a sacrifice to the sins of the American people.
In the silence of the throngs upon the streets
and In the multitude that U willing to come
to church, there U seen the instrument at
work touching the heart of the American peo
ple and bringing them back. to the old truths
of God. In and out of sad events like this
throughout the history of the world there
comes a rebuke to the skepticism of mankind.
Right Rev. A. C. A. Hall. D. D.. Bishop
of Vermont, delivered the morning ser
mon in Shattuck Hall, upon Christian
'love and self-denial. The services -were
conducted by the Rev. George E. Swan,
rector of the church and a fully vested
choir was in attendance. The hall was
crowded to the utmost capacity with
worshipers.
Dr. Hall's sermon was eloquently de
livered. He said in part:
The great rule laid down by Christ is. "Lots
God supremely, and love thy neighbor as thy
self." Follow this and all of the old negative
commandments will take care of themselves.
There is no need of long detailed promises if
you love him supremely and your neighbor as
yourself.
Many of us. and young people especially, are
apt to think that the Christian religion con
sists of a Â»et of tiresome restrictions. So long
as ,we think of our religion In that sort of a
way we haven't got hold of the distinguishing
characteristics of our Lord's religion. Be your
fullest and highest self in honor and In ser
viCe ot our Lord. Christian self-denial is al
ways the letting go of the lower in order that
we may lay hold of something more precious.
It is as much a part of Christian religion to
abhor all things bad as it is to love all things
good. . . \u25a0

The Right Rev. C. P. Anderson, D. D..
Bishop coadjutor, Chicago, preached the
sermon yesterday morning at St. Peter's
Episcopal Church, on Stockton street.
The service was largely attended.
I Attracted by the promise of a. sermon
by Bishop Gailor of Tennessee another
large congregation filled the church in
the evening. In honor of the distin
guished visitor the choral part of the ser
vice was somewhat amplified and the
large attendance was made the occasion
of an appeal by the rector, the Rev. W.
M. Bours, for liberal contributions to a
special collection taken up for the ex
penses of the present convention.
i Bishop Gailor took the text for his
sermon from Deuteronomy 32:47, "For
it is not a vain thing for you because It
.is- your life." He also quoted a verse in
similar .vein from the New Testament.
; The subject of his sermon was religion.
He said in part:

"I regarded that as a very nice saying,
though quite untrue. The effete East hold9
out its hand to the new blood and brawn
of the West. Yet it is not the commercial
enterprises of magnitude, not your energy
in the construction of great railway sys
tems which are to be potential in binding
the East and the West in indissoluble
bonds, but it is the fiber which is behind
these movements. The question is not
what shall be accomplished, but what
shall be the temper, the moral standard
of your works by which to illustrate to
the East the supremacy of the West."
The speaker then referred to his trip to
Japan, the Philippines, India and the Ori
ent. Everywhere he - found young men
banded together in the cause of Christ.
In Madras he found one of the hnest
Young Men's Christian Association build
ings in the world, but finer than the struc
ture itself was the spirit that dwelt with
in Its walls. He spoke of the Oriental caste
which prevented men from dining with
one another, but in the cause of Christian
ity caste was forgotten. He spoke of his
early ministry in New York, and told of
having a trotting horse which one Sunday
sequence. On the occasion of a dinner
given by Mr. Crocker he said: 'We are
glad to have our guest here; we are glad
to open his mind to a much larger horizon
than, living in the effete East, he is ac
customed to. For what gentlemen who
come from his -part of the world need to
learn, what they are perhaps reluctant to
recognize, is the fact that -San Francisco

door of the United States.' '

Rev. Herman L. Dubrlng of Philadel

out the idea of"a glorious future, full of
opportunities. The children were abjured
to seize the best of the world and ad
vance along the lines of character and
beneficent power.
The anthem "Tell It Out Among the
Heathens" concluded the services.
The Right Rev. Edgar. Jacob, Lord

work being done by the association in far

Rolla V. Watt made a few pointed re
marks at the close of Bishop Potter's ad
dress. He urged the young men to stand
firm as Christians, and to assist the asso
ciation In the performance of the noble
work in which it is engaged. .He spoke of
the debt upon the Young Men's Christian
Association building, and expressed the
hope that the young men of this city
would see to it that the mortgage was
soon lifted.
"It is a question of opportunity," con
tinued Bishop Potter. "What are you do
ing with your opportunities? What sacri
fices do you make, what studies do you
pursue? The great auestion of the hour
is honest government, and we' look to our
Christian young men for such govern
ment. All depends upon the sacrifice, de
votion and heroism of the young men. You
may undertake to make a great start on
the basis of philosophy and political econ
omy, but beneath it all must be loyalty to
Jesus Christ. Let me advise you to get

he tried on the road while on his way to
church. A butcher came along in a cart,
and immediately the speaker's horse be
gan to trot at a lively gait. The harder
he pulled the faster the horse went, and
when he passed through the country vil
lage in which his charge was located peo
ple remarked with horror that the Episco
pal clergyman was racing on the Sabbath.
The butcher beat him. however, and the

; Sightseeing In Chinatown, under the
chaperonage of guides, was the rule Sat
urday night. Large parties from the Pal

restaurantas, josshouses and other points
of interest In the Mongolian quarter. To
most of the tourists the trip was a de

joyed.
Many of the visiting Bishops and other
dignitaries of the Episcopal church spent
a portion of Saturday afternoon driving
about the park. Presidio and ocean beach.
The charming weather which prevailed
rendered the visits to the various places
of interest highly enjoyable to all
in consequence of the resolve of the
Bishops to . visit Golden Gate Park car
riages were at a premium. Every dele

residences, as well as those at the Palace.

and barouches were alone required to
transport the Palace delegation.
The places of Interest about the park

along the ocean beach as far as the Cliff
House. The return trip was made about
5 o'clock.

At .the Church of St. John the Evan
gelist yesterday morning the Right Rev.
William Lawrence of Massachusetts took
for his text "Greater things than this
shall ye do." He said that in view of the
general advancement in science and In re
ligious workings the church is able to ac
complish greater results to-day than
could have been accomplished In the days
of Jesus Christ. He stated that we are
standing, as it were, on the achievement
of the past ages, and because of this posi
tion, the church is able to take a step in
advance. He contended that in order for
the church to make great progress an in
timate relation with Jesus Christ must be
maintained.

And behold a certain lawyer stood up and
addressing him said, "What shall I do to gain
eternal life?" and the Savior, answering him,
said, "Do what is written In the law."
A lawyer of that . day was a man whose
â¢study ' was God's law. "Master," said the
lawyer, "what shall-. I do to gain eternal
life?" Think of the answer: He said noth
ins about a sacrifice. He sooke not of his
own flesh and blood as the way to his father's
hand. He doesn't tell him of the living bread
that has come down from heaven. He asks
him what la written In the law. Don't think
that Jesus said to the lawyer that God's law
can be changed. "What has been always will
be God's law can never be changed.
When you stand at the grave and hear the
last artillery of life, dust to dust, ashes to

I do to Ealn eternal life and the kingdom of
heaven?" Thou shalt render unto thy crea

vou wish to buy eternal life, love God with
alTyour heart. Love God with all your mind.
Let thought of him enter into every action of
vour <2ally life. The lawyer, the business
"man, the politician, the clerk, in fact, the
man of every vocation cannot expect to buy
eternal life by allowing his dally routine to
crush God out of his mind. \u25a0 Ask yourself
from time to time durlnjc the press of your
business affairs, "Isn't there room In my
mind for love and, thoughts of God?" Ton

and you can't get away from It.

man's father and you can't love God without
loving man. God has given us eternal life In

said, behold, I thought he will surely
come out to me and stand and call on, the
name of the Lord, his God, and strike his
hand over the place and recover the
leper." â¢ ... â¢
The Bishop Is a forceful and convincing
talker and easily holds the attention or
his audience. He briefly pointed out the
lesson to be learned from the story of the
leperâ the necessity for right thinking.
He said:
We. get our guarantee of the permanency of
life in the life of Christ, and -in spite of-pain,
doubt and distress, the human soul goes on
ward toward the goal it , believes \u25a0 must â¢ be
reached. As we stand In thÂ« presence of â¢ that
terrible mystery ,we call deatb, our consolation
lies in the knowledge that" our* - life is not

The greatest commandment Is: "Thou shalt

ment Is "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy
self." I am afraid we do not love God enough,
but we should not be discouraged. Our re
ligious love should come, from within and not
from without. True religion is the essence of
the attitude of the heart toward God. We
should love â¢ God because God loves us. A

BY reason of the continual discussion going on
among the British people concerning American
products, the directors of the Crystal Palace,
it is said, have about determined to' hold next year
an exposition devoted exclusively to American goods.
They argue that* the competition of this country with
Europe has been so keen that it has created some
thing like a popular demand for a comprehensive
knowledge of our industrial achievements and accord
ingly that- no sort of exposition would draw better
among the British' masses or among the sightseers
of the Continent than one which would undertake to
exhibit what. Americans \u25a0 are doing in the way. of
furnishing civilization with everything needed from
food to -mechanism.
Such an exposition held, at the Crystal \u25a0 Palace
.would strikingly reveal the errors of .the estimates
made by the ablest of British thinkers when the
famous palace was first opened for exposition pur
poses fifty years ago. In 1851 the Crystal Palace was
one of the wonders of the world. Its magnitude
impressed the mind, and the fact that it was con
structed of iron and glass was accounted a genuine
marvel, for at : that time those materials were but
little used for structural purposes. Moreover, it was
a period when people talked much of free trade and
of peace. It was fondly, believed that the beautiful
palace of glass, devoted to industry and designed for
the joy and the instruction of the people, would stand
as the monument of the beginning of a new era, and
that within fifty years there would be freedom of
trade amortg the nations of the earth, and armies and
fleets would be well nigh obsolete.
The fifty years have passed. Europe is an armed
camp. The ocean, bears more, and heavier warships
than- ever before in its history. F fee tra de is dying,
discredited in the land of. its birth. Thi competition
among nations, both in military and in industrial af
fairs, is keener than ever. The nation that fifty years
ago was hardly counted as a power irt the world is
now the foremost; greatest in peace and most to be
dreaded in war. It'will therefore be quite fitting that
at. its next exposition the palace should be given up
exclusively , to an > American exhibition. .
AN AMERICAN EXPOSITION.
There is of course a chance for a revival of po
litical activity before the elections take place, should
anything arise to stimulate popular interest, but there
is little probability of such a thing happening. In
several of the State elections the officers to be chosen
are comparatively unimportant, and the fights will
be. made "mainly for election of members of the Leg
islature. As the Democratic convention in Iowa re
affirmed the Bryan platform, while that of Ohio re
pudiated it, there will be of course some curiosity. to
see what the effect will be upon the vote of the party
in the two States. Anything in the way of a 1 better
showing in Iowa than in Ohio will of course be hailed
by the Bryanites as an evidence of the continued
popularity of their leader, while the opposite result
would greatly strengthen the .reorganizes and might
possibly so dishearten the radicals of the party, that
Bryan would hardly be a factor worth counting in
the next national convention.
Nebraska was carried by Republicans last fall, and
it is expected they will carry it again. The only
State officers to be chosen, however, are a Treasurer
and two Justices of the Supreme Court,, and conse
quently there is not much enthusiasm or activity in
the contest. In the remaining States there is no
doubt whatever as to the result. Virginia will of
course go Democratic, while Massachusetts, Penn
sylvania, New Jersey and Rhode Island will uphold
the banner of Republicanism. . . - ...
Far more interesting than any of the State con
gests is that waged in New York against Tammany.
There was at one time a prospect of a fine fight
in Ohio, but the assassination of the President has
put an end to anything like a vigorous campaign on
either side. The Republicans will carry, the State
as a matter of course. In Maryland there is a slight
chance for a strong contest, since Gorman is making
the last fight of his. life to get back to the Senate,
but even there the popular mind has remained up
to this time comparatively listless on the' subject.
OF all the off years in the history of our poli
tics this has probably been the one most
marked by popular indifference to the ac
tivity of politicians. State elections are to be held
this fall in Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, Rhode Island
and Virginia, nine States in 'all, and yet in not a
single one of them does there appear to be any vigor
in the campaign.

The coast defenses of the United Kingdom are gradually
being improved to bring them up to modern requirements. No
less than two hundred heavy muzzle-loading guns have been
removed from the forts at the mouth of the Thames and up
to-date breech-loaders substituted: old ironclads have been
fitted out and are kept as coast defenders at the most impor
tant points, and in addition torpedo defenses already provided
or contemplated will make the coast defenses of England quite
formidable. . â¢ ,
The British Admiralty is said to have made a contract
with Elswick to build a destroyer to replace the Cobra, lost
last month in the North Sea. It is admitted that vessels of
this class are unsuited for going to sea In all sorts of weather,
owing to their extreme lightness of hull, and It is Intended to
hold them in reserve until conditions of the weather permit
their use without taking the chances of 1 foundering. The 36
knot destroyer thus constitutes the fair weather fighting part
of the British navy.
Satisfactory trials with liquid fuel have been made in tha
French navy. The battleship Jena has used oil and coal to
gether, by which the horsepower was increased from 4000 to
6500 in a few minutes.
The record of the Belleville boiler in the French navy ia
given in the latest number of "Information From Abroad,"
and contrasts singularly with the results of,the same boiler in
the British navy. Twenty-five vessels are named, of which the
most important with the period of use of this boiler are:
Voltigeur, dispatch vessel, in .commission from 1SS0 to 1SS6, ex
cepting an interval of ten months; Milan, cruiser, fourteen
years' active service; Leger and Leuvler, torpedo vessels,
seven and one-half years; Alger, cruiser, four years, and re
turned from China cruise of twenty-eight months in perfect
condition: Latouche-Trevllle, Chauzy, Trehouart, Bruix, Bu
geaud, Descartes, Pascal and Charner, five years; Brennus
six years: Amiral Rigault de Genouilly, ten years, and ten
other vessels, built between 1S97 and 1900, range from four to
one year. \u2666
The total estimated cost of all the naval works in Great
Britain and its possessions since 1S97 and to be completed by
190$ amounts to $137,509,320. This sum is likely to be largely ex
ceeded, and at the late session of Parliament $8,765,000 addi
tional grants were voted. By 190S it is expected that the im
provements will be completed at Dover, Gibraltar Malta.

THE gallant Stephen Decatur made the trenchant remark
that the people of this country looked upon the navy as
"pillars In war and caterpillars in peace." This was on
the occasion when Congress almost obliterated the navy
" after the war of 1S12-15, and Decatur's observation fits
to three subsequent instances of public indifference, namely,
after the wars of 1S46-48, 1S61-G5 and that of 1898. It is true that
many navy ships are now in course of construction, but that
is chiefly because of 'an understanding between and a pooling
of interests of the navy people, the ship buildere and manu
facturers, for the general public takes next to no Interest in
naval affairs. It is different in the countries of Europe, where
navy leagues are established and nourish. The object of these
organizations is chiefly to educate the "people to the needs cf
a navy and in that way influence legislation. They exist in
Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, and the old
estâthat in Great Britainâ dates back only seven years. The
German Navy League had a membership of 566.141 on January
1 last; that of France numbers about uOOO. Those of Italy and
Spain are yet In their infancy, and there is no indication of a
navy league in the United States.

There Is discontent in. the British navy over the rations,
and a committee, presided over by Vice Admiral E. Rice, has
made its report and made certain important recommendations.
It admits that in many instances some articles, such as pre
served meats, flour and biscuits, have been issued when their
ago limit had been exceeded and thus become unpalatable. It
recommends the addition of several foods, giving a greater
variety in the diet, and recommends that the allowance for
"savings"â or commutation of rations as termed in our navy â
be increased from two-thirds to three-quarters of its cost
price. Salt pork, for example, which costs the Government
12*4 cents a ". pound", was thus bought back from the men at 8
cents. It Is further recommended that the time allowed for
meal hours should aggregate three, hours thirty-five minutes,
instead of two hours thirty minutes. :Vi.t
Inventors in England complain of the indifference shown
by the War Department and Admiralty to Inquire into the
merits of devices submitted. It is rarely that any attention is
paid to any models or propositions for Improvements in war
material, and it takes many months even in the most favored
cases before the inventor receives the stereotyped answer that
his "suggestions will be laid before the board." After this
nothing further is heard unless the applicant persists in know
ing the result and his model is finally returned with another
printed statement that it Is not up to service requirements.
Germany: pursues a different" policy." It welcomes "cranks"
and inventors and an examining board is kept constantly at
work looking into every proposal for improvement in war
material, and it also takes cognizance of everything offered to
the Patent Office. If the board finds a good thing, useful to
the Government, it never gets patented, for the Government
buys it and keeps the secret. In this country great difficulty
is likewise experienced by inventors to get any attention paid
to their propositions. The Army and Navy departments are
close corporations, the members of which are reluctant to even
look at things which owe their origin to outsiders. The inven-

Germany is once more unhappy about her Kaiser;
he has not only stopped the development of the elec

THERE is a growing opinion among yachtsmen that the
reason the Columbia beat the Constitution, which is sup
posedly built on faster lines, in the tryouts before the
great yacht race is not to be found so much in the poor
fit of her sails as it is in the way she was sailed. It is
freely stated by thosa who ought to know that the Columbia
won because Charlie Barr is her skipper.
The Constitution's crew was thoroughly American. Some of
the men came from Deer Isla/lfl. The others were gathered
from various points of the Eastern coast, from Long Island to
Maine. Her â¢ skipper is Uriah Rhodes, a typical Yankee, who
now hails from Long Island.
The Columbia's crew is Scandinavian, almost to a' man.
Her skipper is Charlie Barr, who is best described as a "can
ny" Scot. He commanded the ColumHa, jyhen she defeated

Shamrock I In the cup race series of 1809.
Barr and Rhodes guided their boats to thÂ© starting 1 line
more than a score of times since the Constitution was launched
at Bristol this spring. Eighteen of these races -were finished
and Barr won ten of them notwithstanding the fact that he
was supposed to have an old style and slower toat under him.
Not only as a sea jockey is Barr famous. He has a keen
nose for a wind, and has often startled his rivals by turning hi3
ship about and sailing oft the course, apparently giving up the
race. But nine times out of ten he finds a new breeze corning
up In another direction, which wins him the race, because he
gets it Hr3t.
In brief. Barr is the cleverest, trickiest, wisest skipper In

have been unsettled of late, going up one day and
down the next. Prices are high and the sentiment
among operators is that they cannot be maintained
long. The great packers have been standing under
the market so far, but whenever they relax their
hold the market at once softens. Wheat rules weak,
a large American crop and liberal offerings from
Russia on the English markets operating against
any firmness.
The feature of the local situation last week was
the settlement of the greatest strike ever experienced
in this city, and which during its course of about two
months seriously diminished the business of an other
wise very active and profitable year. The loss in
dollars cannot be accurately estimated, but it was
immense. When the strike began many lines, of
trade were reporting the greatest activity in their
history, and the months of August and' September
are among the best we have. But even with this
handicap our local bank clearings showed a large
movement of goods, and they almost invariably ex
ceeded those of last year. This fact alone will give a
fair idea of what the community lost through the
strike. Everything js running along about as usual
again, however, and when -the accumulated business
is got out of the way and the commercial decks
cleared for new business we ought to roll up a fine
fall trade. Prices for almost everything produced in
the State are on a profitable basis to producer,
manufacturer and merchant, and it is a pity that such
a fine year should have been so disturbed. The early
rains seem to foreshadow a good rainfall this. winter,
though the sign is by no means infallible, hence the
outlook for the State continues brilliant.
The staples show little change. The iron and steel
trade is still reported in good shape. There are
enormous contracts out for steel rails for next year's
delivery, hence no dullness in this line is expected
in the near future. Wool and woolen goods are
moving off steadily nt good prices, and the demand
for boots and shoes is so much better than anticipated
that jobbers in some sections report that they are
unable to obtain goods enough to fill all their orders.
Hides have gone up and are quoted firm. Provisions
SOME irregularity in trade was visible last week.
A halting tendency appeared in some lines.
There was no falling off in the general aggre
gate in trade, as far as commercial reports indi
cated, and the country's bank clearings were 30.8 per
cent larger than during the same week last year, but
the staples controlled by the trusts showed more or
less hesitation. This .was especially the case in Wall
street, where the industrials were weak, . with the
banks calling in a good many loans on them in order
to get rid of those which might be classed as doubt
ful collateral. The industrials have recently exhibited
less tendency to rise, and, as some of them have
appeared more or less unsteady, the public has shown
a disposition to take their profits where they could
and retire to cover for a brief season until this class
of securities shows more strength. The decline in
Amalgamated Copper, which is said to be due to a
lessened demand for the raw product, has been the
governing factor in this liquidation. It will be
remembered that a year or so ago . the New York
banks began to look on the industrials as securities
with some disfavor and subsequently weeded a good
many of them out of their loan accounts. They are
doing the same now, and including in the process
more or less low priced, non-dividend paying railway
shares. It is apparently one of those- periodical sift
ing out seasons in the banking business when a halt
is called on all securities that are not strictly first class.

BOOKER T. WASHINGTON has taken ad
vantage of the present outburst, of, public
indignation against anarchy to make an appeal
to the Southern people that they denounce with an
equal firmness the barbarous practice of lynch law.
His address was made through the Montgomery
Advertiser and is marked by a boldness of speech
that is the more impressive because Professor Wash
ington is known as a man of habitual reserve and
caution in speaking upon public questions outside of
those relating to education and industry.
In the reports of the address that have come to us
Professor Washington is quoted as saying:
"I want to ask, is Czolosz alone guilty? Has not
the entire nation had a part in this greatest crime
of the century? What is anarchy but a defiance of
law, and has not the nation reaped what it has been
sowing?* * * * One criminal put to death through
the majesty of the law does more, to my mind, to
prevent crime than ten put to death by the hand of
lynching anarchists."
The phrase "lynching, anarchists" is pat, pertinent
and precise. Vlt hits- the mark. The gangs of
murderous men who have again and again violated
the laws of the land and every dictate of humanity in
inflicting death by tlie most cruel barbarities upon
victim after victim are virtually as anarchistic in
their practices as ever was any professed anarchist in
his teaching. Moreover, lynch law is far more
dangerous to American life than the imported
anarchy which is taught by vicious aliens in the slums
of our great cities. The records show that during
the last sixteen years over 3000 persons have been
put to death in this country^by mobs. ;.The crime
has been cpinmitted''iiuring,that period in every State
and Territory in the Union, except Delaware, Massa
chusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Utah and
Vermont. More than half of the whole number of
lynchings took place, in the eight Southern States,
and more than half of the victims were negroes.
Professor Washington points out that when the
practice of lynching was begun it was said in defense
of it that it would be resorted to for the punishment
of but one crime, but the records show that so
rapidly does lawlessness breed lawlessness that more
people are now lynched each year for other alleged
crimes than for that for whose punishmcnt.it was
begun.
It is' well known that the better elements of the
South have already i evoked against lynching and
that time and again men of influence in the Southern
States have been outspoken in denouncing it. Never
theless, Professor Washington has done well in
directing attention to the question again in order that
it may be studied in the light of the present public
sentiment on the subject of anarchy. As he himself
says: "Now that judges, the pulpit and the press in
all parts of the country are condemning lynching
and anarchy, as never before, it is time to begin
reform and enforce respect for law."
ANARCHY A IN D LYNCH LAW.
An appeal was taken from the decision of the
Justice, and on a hearing before the Court of Appeal
the decision of the lower court was overruled. /The
Master of Rolls, who delivered the decision, with the
concurrence of the other Justices, held that the society
could not be held as a society, and pointed out that
in the trade union acts there is no provision
empowering a trade union to sue or to be sued except
in relation to its ow.i property. The injunction was
therefore dissolved and the defendants were given
costs, but the plaintitfs were given leave to appeal to
th House of Lords, which they did.
The House of Lords has now overruled the Court
of Appeal and confirmed the decision of Justice Far
well. The Lord Chancellor in moving that the appeal
be allowed said: "In this case I am content to adopt
the judgment of Mr. Justice Farwell, with which I
entirely agree, and I cannot find a satisfactory answer
to that judgment in the judgment of the Court of
Appeal which overruled it. If the Legislature has
created a thing which can own property, which can
employ servants and which can inflict injury, it must
be taken, I think, to have impliedly given the power
to make it suable in the courts of law for injuries
purposely done by its authority and procurance."
Being thus authorized to sue for damages, the Taff
Vale Railway Company has entered suit against the
Amalgamated Society for Â£20,000 damages. That suit
has not yet come on for hearing, but the principle
of law established by the decision of the Lords has
been recognized as virtually creating an entirely new
relation between labor unions and the public in Great
Britain.
It is said -that many of the labor union leaders
believe the. effects of the decision will be beneficial
to unionism, since employers will hereafter, for their
own protection, deal solely with union labor and
ignore non-union men because the unions are re
sponsible for their acts, while individual workers can
escape civil liability. On the other hand, it is believed
by British employers that if the unions can be held
for damages for.injurj' done by strikers the unions
will be more cautious in ordering strikes. It would
seem,, therefore, that both sides to the controversy
expect: beneficial results from the decision, and it
goes without saying the effects of it will be watched
with almost as much interest in this country as in
Great Britain itself.
Justice Farwell in granting the injunction con
ceded that a trade union is neither a corporation, nor
an individual, nor a partnership among a number of
individuals; but maintained that a trade union is none
the less in the eyes of the law a "corporate body,"
and as such is qualified to sue and be sued.
MAURICE LOW, the well known Washing
ton correspondent of the. Boston Globe and
the London Chronicle, has directed atten
tion in the October Forum to. an Important decision
of the House of Lords in a case affecting the liability
of British labor unions to sue and be sued as corpor
ations." As- Mr. Low points out, the decision is not
only of great importance to British labor unions but
is also of interest to the people of this country, since
the trend of legislation here is not widely different
from that of Great Britain.
The case arose out of a strike on the part of the
employes of the Taff Vale Railway. The strike was
ordered by the Amalgamated Society of Railway Ser
vants, a powerful labor union, and the railway station
at Cardiff was picketed by the strikers. The railway
company thereupon applied for an injunction against
two of the officers of the Amalgamated Society to
restrain them from watching and besetting the station
and the adjacent property, claiming that their actions
were in violation of the conspiracy and protection to
property act. The plaintiffs -further asked for an
injunction against the society itself on the same
ground. The application was opposed by the Amal
gamated Society upon the ground that being neither
a corporation nor an individual the society could not
be sued in a quasi corporate, nor in any â¢ other
capacity, and that an action in tort would not lie.
A BRITISH PRECEDENT.
That issue has been clearly made -by the reform
candidates. . In accepting the nomination for Mayor
from the Citizens' Union Mr. Seth Low said: "The
nomination you tender me is one of several, every
one of which is based on the same fundamental con
ceptions of what is necessary to secure good city ad-'
ministration, and all of which reflect a general and
common purpose to wrest the control of the city from
those who permit one man to govern it from his
English home, like a second George III, and to make
millions for himself and his friends out of his control
of it, as though this imperial city of New York were
his private gold mine. A system of government
which permits this will permit anything, and it is not
strange that in the train of such things as these every
imaginable evil that bad government can produce
has befallen the city. In contradistinction -to the
government we have, that is conducted primarily to
make political leaders rich, the government we
should strive to set vp is one whose single and only
purpose shall be to promote the public interest and
to make the conditions of life more tolerable for the.
multitudes to whom the name of New York, and not
Wantage, 'conveys the idea of home", .
A fight made in that spirit cannot fail to be inter
esting. It brings Croker's personality into the fore
frpnt of. the battle and compels every voter to deter
mine whether he prefers to be ruled by that kind of
a boss. The prospects are that Croker will be beaten
and that David Bennett Hill will have the satisfac
tion of seeing his enemy driven out of New York
politidl altogether.
The struggle of the reform elements of the commun
ity has been directed this time against Cfoker per
sonally. It is felt" that the best way to get rid of the
system of government that has corrupted the whole
municipal' administration is to overthrow the boss
who dominates and inspires it.

About 4 o'clock yesterday morning John
Evans, a waiter living at 59 Jessie street,
dropped a five-dollar gold piece at Pine

attracted a crowd, among them being A.-
Costello, a fruit packer living at 625 Val

show them how a five-dollar gold piece
would look and dropped one on the
ground, which. Evans promptly picked up,
declaring it was the one he had lost. Coa
tello protested and Policeman McShane
was called upon, but he declined to decide
the question and took the two men to
the Central police station. Lieutenant
Birdsall asked them to call in the after

their clever little sisters and brothers and
will have the opportunity to-night, to
morrow afternoon and to-morrow night.
Next Sunday night the Royal Italian
band, with its marvelous leader, Creatore.
will be here. The advance sale of seats
opens on Thursday at Sherman & Clay's
music store.
The new bill which opens at the Chutes
to-day includes Richards and Relyea,
comedy acrobats; Mile. Lotty, the modern.
Venus, in poses; Harry Allen, a coon,
shouter, who is pronounced a wonder at
singing ragtime; Carter brothers, contor

The Alcazar has lately been equipped
with all the modern mechanical and elec

in use at the po-pular little theater.

The Alcazar's delightful bill this week
Is the mirth-provoking "Too Much John
son," always a first favorite with Alcazar
audiences. Mr. M. L. Alsop, from his in
timate association with William Gillette
in the play, is particularly' well" fitted to
play Billings' part, having understudied
Gillette in the part and frequently played
It when that clever actor was ill.
To-night the Tivoli will revive "The
Masked Ball" that is to be one of the
Grau numbers in the Intended Verdi cy
cle that is to be given this year.. Ferrari
will sing the part of Renato, Agostini will
gather new glory as Ricarao and Monta
nari sings .the part of Amelia, one of the
best soprano roles in all the Verdi litera
ture.
The alternate bill is "Nabucco," that
will be revived in response to an over
whelming demand. The management ex
pected for It, when the opera was given
a. wepk or two ago, only a success de
curiosite, but its musical swing and spirit
placed it at once with the operatic favor
ites. Barbareschi appears t magnificently
Salassa, who Is famed throughout Italy
therein as Abegaille, and as Nabucco
for his assumption of the role, surpasses
himself. Dado is also excellent as the
High Priest of Baal.
The nattering and encouraging success
of Shakespearean drama down at the
Grand Opera-house last week, under Mr.
Haworth's capable direction, makes the
choice of "Hamlet" for the last week of
the eminent actor's engagement indeed
a wise one. Of al lthe good things that
Mr. Haworth can do, he is credited with
finer worth in this most difficult task of,
essaying Hamlet's part than in anything
else in his repertoire. He is the legiti
mate successor of Booth in the part and
his Interpretation is distinguished -by a
sweetness, dignity. and breadth that place
it in the category of the best legitimate
work of the day. Miss Adele Belgarde,
whose conception of Portia last week gave
much pleasure, will assume Ophelia's
part and Herschell Mayall will be an ef

"Florodora" has certainly caught "the
town. To-night the piquant musical com
edy enters upon its second week, fully as
sured of the same overflowing measure
of success that marked the first week's
presentment. The sextet is probaftly the
most popular number of its kind that has
ever been heard here, and the six pretty
maidens and six stalwart youths that
make its music are as dashing half-dozen
mimes and minstrels as may be seen any
where. There are others, too, hosts of
them, and the brilliant freshness and
beauty of the gowns and picturesque set
tings "add not a little to the effect. The
orchestral work is bright and smart, and
though the sextet rather overshadows
things there are plenty more good mu
sical numbers in the piece.

Volkyra, America's greatest hand bal
ancer; Robel Simms, tramp cartoonist;
Sam Holdsworth, the eminent tenor, and
Sydney Smith, a charming child dancer.
August Hinrichs' orchestra will present a
new programme.
A large audience turned out to greet
Herrmann the Great. at the California
last night. ' Herrmann, like good wine,
improves with age. He surpasses himself
in magic this season, and last night com
pletely proved his worth as a wonder
worker.
His illusion entitled "An Escape From
Sing Sing" is a fascinating piece of work,
and Herrmann makes it more mysterious
by his simplicity. His piece de resistance
is called "Noah's Ark, or After the
Flood." The ark is placed upon trestles
in plain view cf the audience, and after
it has been taken, apart and shown to
be perfectly empty Herrmann starts the
flood. The magician draws from the ark
dozens of fowls, guinea pigs, dogs and
finally shows a beautiful girl in restful
pose. "The Turkish Elopement" is an
other illusion that calls forth much ap
plause.
By way of diversion McWatter, Tyson
and their clover helpers afford much mer
riment. Their sketch "Scenes in a Dress

hilarity and clever vaudeville work.

Resolutions of condolence upon the
death ~ of President William McKinley
continue to be adopted by various organi
zations. Lincoln Post, Grand Army of
the Republic, has adopted the resolutions
that follow: .._... .
' Whereas, The. President of the United States
of America, Comrade William McKinley, dur
ing public festivities in the city of Buffalo,
N. Y., and while in the act of expressing to
his fellow citizens his respect and confidence
in their affection, was attacked by an assassin,
who on the 6th day of September inflicted upon
our President wounds by the use of a loaded
pistol with murderous intent, from the effects
of which wounds then received our profoundly
respected President died on the 14th inst; and
whereas, we learn with deep humiliatibn that
-the murderous assault upon our chief mag
istrate was made by one., born in our country,
educated in our public schools and one who
had received the blessed example of law-abid
ing citizens, Christian scholars and literary
gentlemen, and one who should ever have felt
it his highest duty to have at . the peril of
his life protected the chief executive of the
republic; therefore be it . .
Resolved. That Lincoln Post No. 1, Depart
ment of California and Nevada, Grand Army
of the Republic, in common with every Ameri
can citizen, expresses its limitless sorrow and
shame that our beloved President and comrade
should thus have been made a new martyr to
the high ideals of enlightened government,
humane institutions and national virtue, virtues
which have made this republic the anchor of
hope in the hearts of all ra,ces of men on this
earth.

Shortly after the shooting two police
officers appeared and made a search for
the supposed wounded man, but without
avail. Failing to locate him they went to
the Palmer House and closely questioned
the inmates. They all admitted that sev
eral shots had been fired from the house,
but disclaimed knowing who was re
sponsible for them. A citizen named
Murphy, who was passing at the time,
informed the police that the shooter
opened the window of his room and
blazed away at the crowd. He was sur
prised to learn that only one of the
belligerents had been wounded.
A mysterious shooting, which the police
are investigating, occurred at 3 o'clock
yesterday morning at Pacific and 'San
some streets. As far as is known at least
one man was shot, but up to a late hour
last night no trace of him had been found.
According to an eyewitness to the shoot
ing, a gang of union and, non-union sailors
engaged in a row at Pacific and Sansome
streets and considerable blood was shed.
As- the non-union men were getting the
worst of it a sympathizer, who lives in
the Palmer House, which is situated on
the corner opposite where the fight took
place, opened fire on the crowd. After
several shots had been fired one 4 of the
union men fell as if mortally wounded.
He was promptly picked up by two of his
friends and carried down Pacific street.

Si &5a A vmB \u25a0\u25a0Â» ELSOME OF THE SIGHTS WHEN
THE ALAMEDA SWUNG INTO
THE SEA. ;
WASHINGTON, Qct. 6.â The rapid de
cline of the native population of the Aleu
tian chain of islands Is told In a report
just received by the Marine Hospital
Service from F. J. Thornburg, its assist
ant surgeon at Dutch Harbor, Alaska.
The report says that formerly there were
120 vil'ofces on the islands with a native
population variously estimated at from
1500 to 2500. Now In the same district
there are only ten villages and 1000 inhab
itants, exclusive of whites, of whom 300
are Creoles (.mixed breeds with Russians
and other nationalities) and 700 Aleuts.
The lt-aort says:
As many as half a dozen dead bodies have
been seen by prospectors in a single hovel and
numerous dead bodies were seen lying about
on the ground partly eaten by foxes.
There are numerous instances of whole vil
lages being: deserted, the few surviving na
tives having a superstition about staying
where so many of their number had died
The remarkable mortality from measles
among the natives In Alaska during the past
year appears ascribable largely to the bad
sanitary environment and lack of precaution
against exposure.
On the Kuskowln and in other sections on
the mainland, from one-half to two-thirds of
the natives died and many more \u25a0were left un
buiied in the mud houses where they lived,
surviving members immediately deserting the
huts, which latter often contain from "one to
two dozen natives living regardless of family
relations.
Last year Unalaska had 353 Inhabitants, 116
of whom, or neatly one-third, died. Accord
ing to data obtained from the Russian priest
of the Greek Catholic Church, Rev. P. B. Kas
sereroff, who has the only mortality records
kept in the village, there being no health officer
or even physician, thirty deaths were ascribed
to "cold," twenty-four to consumption, thirty
three to measles and seven to old age; five
were drowned.
MONTEREY, Oct. 6.â Miss Hattie Ruhl
and Miss Pauline \u25a0 Belard, two young
ladies of Monterey, went out in a sail
boat on the bay to-day and both are now
ill, one so seriously that the physicians
in attendance are considerably alarmed.
Miss Belard is recovering, but the con
dition of Miss Ruhl has not greatly im
proved.
The young women had not been on the
bay before and accepted an invitation for
a sail with a party of friends. The water
â¢was choppy, and both became seasick.
They were also very nervous and fright-

$300,000 estate in trust. The will provided
that he was to receive only the interest
for two years. At the end of that period
the entire fortune was to be at his dis
posal. Heir to a fortune though he was,
his last extremity found him almost pen
niless. Had he lived but thirty days more
he would have been a rich man and his
widow would have come into possession of
his wealth without, question or contro
versy. As matters now stand there are
great probabilities of litigation over the
fortune. There is a provision in the will
that in the case of his death before the
payment of the trust, the fortune should
revert to De Forest's two sisters. Mrs.
Dooley and Mrs. Colbran, both of New

and -while some had a most enjoyable
time others had not. The latter were those
\u25a0who suffered from mal.de mer, and once
the bar was reached the proceedings had
no more interest for them. Most prom
inent among the unfortunates, because
they were most in demand, were the
members of the band. While the steam
ship was In the bay they got along fairly
well, but once the bar was reached they
one and all dropped their instruments and
became very anxious to see if they could
not discover .the spot upon which the
lightship's anchor lies imbedded. No
amount of persuasion could inducp them
to .return to their instruments until J. C.
Wilson, the well-known coal man, was
appointed a music committee of one. Mr.
Wilson engaged R. S. Moore of the Ris
don Iron Works as an assistant, and be-,
tween them they succeeded in getting the
followers of Orpheus back to their post.
If the efforts of -the musical committee
were a success those of the musicians cer
tainly were not. The band struck up
"Sweet Marie," but had only reached the
third note when the clarionet player gave
a gulp and stopped playing. The others
kept bravely on to the end of the bar,
but the opening of the second proved too
much for the cornetist and he stopped
playing.
. Left without the leading instruments,
the band was like a chicken with . a
broken wing, but at that moment old
ocean either put them out of or into their
misery. The good ship rose up. to a gen
tle roller, then rocked quietly from side
to side, and the scattering of. those bands-

working pressure of 180 pounds, all fitted
for natural draught. .
The gain in dead-weight carrying ca
pacity for the round trip with the new
machinery will be nearly 1000 tons.
The old machinery indicated 2500 horse
power and 'gave an average speed of 13.8
knots per hour, with a daily consumption
of sixty-five tons of coal.
The new machinery will indicate easily
3000 horsepower and will give a speed of
fifteen knots upon fifty-six tons of coal.
The maximum horsepower of the ship is
3500, which will drive her at a speed of
about sixteen knots per hour.
The ice machine and the refrigerating
plant were built by the Risdon Iron
Works and differ from others, being of
the "marine type," built especially for
ship purposes, and have a refrigerating
capacity equal to 15,000 feet of space for
each machine, the entire plant being in
duplicate. The ice machine will produce
enough frozen material at one time to
supply the entire ship's company in
abundance for twenty-four hours. .
Seasickness Stills Musicians.
When the steamship got alongside Pa
cific-street wharf the first men ashore
were the musiciansâ in fact, the flutist did
not wait for i.he gangway, but nearly
broke his neck jumping 1 from an after
cargo port to the wharf.
Of course, there were others seasick as
well as the band, but as they played a
minor part their deathly struggles will
not be chronicled.
For more than a half-hour the bands
men -were allowed to study the mysteries
of the deep in peace, and then the people
who know not what seasickness is began
to clamor for some music. Some one sug
gested "A Life on the Ocean "Wave," and
the music committee was called upon to
furnish an accompaniment to the song.
After herculean efforts the band was
again got together, but truly It was a
woe-begone looking crowd. After the first
bar the flutist was clearly not in condi
tion, and his instrument required an ex
tra amount of care upon his arrival home
last night. Tha others all held out until
the end of the first verse, and then they
bolted. Each man stowed himself away
in a safe place, and neither threats nor
bribes could gst him to the music stand
again as long as the Alameda was away
from the dock. - Â»
men that followed was a sight to behold.
In the twinkling of an eye their instru
ments were on the deck or tucked under
their arms, while the owners were hang

and then came home again. A heavy fog
hung- over the ocean, so no real test of
speed could be made, nevertheless enough
was done to show that the mail boat is
equal to all the requirements of the con
tract and that she will be able to hold
her own in any company on the Pacific.
From the time she was launched, in 1883,
up to last February the Alameda was in
continuous service, and during all that
time never met with a mishap of any
consequence, nor was she laid up for re
pairs. "When the Ventura, Sonoma and
Sierra were completed the directors of
the company decided to modernize both
the Alameda and the Mariposa. The
former was the first to go out of com

DEATH ARRIVES
BEFORE RICHES
A letter from President Roosevelt re
gretting his inability to be present was
read.
An interesting feature of the meeting
â¢was the reading- of a letter from Dr. M.
X>. Mann, one of the President's physi
cians, to the secretary of the association.
It was dated Buffalo, September 26, and
said: -
Ab President McKinley was dying: I stood be
hind a screen in his room and heard him say
his last words. His wife came into the room
and he said to her: "Good-by, all; good-by. It's
God's way. His will bÂ« done, not ours."
There was some further conversation with his
â¢wife in the way of leave-takinr, but this
ehould not be repeated. About an hour later
he said to his wife: " 'Nearer, my God, to
thee, c'en though it be a cross,' has been my
constant prayer." He tried to say something
more, but I couldn't catch it. I pave out at
the time the first sentence as being the most
appropriate to be remembered as his last words.

The meeting was presided over by
Colonel J. H. Brlgham, Assistant Secre
tary of Agriculture. The speeches were
full of expressions of love and honor for
the memory of Mr. McKlnley and dwelt
on the virtues and qualities that had en
deared him to the people. Several of the
speakers -took occasion to denounce an
archists in unmeasured terms and ad
vised that drastic measures be taken
against them.
WASHINGTON. Oct 6.â The sons and
daughters of the late President McKin

Rodriguez was stabbed in the back, the
blade penetrating the kidney and prob

F. Andrews, a prospector. 72 years of age,
was found in the south end of the city

He had been in hard luck of late, and In
a pitiful letter to Mayor Fletcher he de
scribed his poverty and asked for inter
ment in the potter's Held in a rough box
or sack, as he was too poor to buy either
a box or a coffin. He also described his
mode of suicide to avert the necessity of
an inquest, stating he would use three
sticks of giant powder placed on the top
of his head, with a couple of flat stones
on top of the same.
Andrews came from New Brunswick to
Nelson eleven years ago. Some years ago
he staked and developed the Goodenough
claim, on Morning Mountain. This claim
he bequeathed, together with $2, the only
money he had, to Mrs. Stewart, with
whom he boarded for the last two years.

LONDON*, Oct. 6.â A certain tightness

RIVERSIDE. Oct. 6.â Coroner Dlckson
returned this morning from Banning,
where he went on Friday to investigate
the manner of death of a man whose body
had been found in the mountains near
that place. Charles Anderson of Banning,
while out hunting last Sunday, discovered
the skeleton of a man In the mountains
about six miles from the settlement. The
man's death will ever remain a mystery,
the theory being that. he committeed sui
cide. The body lay on a blanket, part of
which was drawn over it, as though the
man had lain down to die.
No signs of a struggle were apparent.
The place was on the top of a steep ridge,
where there was only six feet of level
ground, and to which it was exceedingly
dlfllcult to climb. This precludes the idea
of a murder and the placing of the body
there afterward. A few articles and a lit
tle money were found on the body, which
was covered by a suit of old clothing. In
the opinion of the Coroner the body had
lain there about two years. The Coro
ner's jury brought in a verdict of "an un
known: death from unknown causes."

WASHINGTON. Oct. â¬.â United States
Consul McWade. at Canton. China, in a
mail report dated August 5 last, states
that the plague then had almost entirely
disappeared from Canton and the hospital
boats for the treatment of patients had
been transferred from their moorings In
the Pearl River, opposite Canton, to tem
porary stations below the leper village.
It is safe to assume, according to the
Consul, that the epidemic is fast disap

its immedintf vicinity.
A special 75-yard race will be held next
Sunday between E. Martin and A. Heintz.

President Castro's statement is a strong im
putation. Do all reports of conflict originate
in New York? Are not Mr. Hay's notes more
worthy? Can Venezuela make believe that the
powers have sent warships upon sensational
rumors? Would Mr. Roosevelt before Presi
dent McKlnley's grave have dealt minutely
with the relations of the United States to tha
Colombian question? Indeed, President Castro
seems to reign by more primitive means than
tha Grand Duchess of Gerolstein.
The National Zeitung says:
Kor a fortnight the world was under the im
pression that" a. war was In progress in Cen
tral and South America. The latest dispatches
show this was only the imagination of the
American reporters and that not a shot has
been fired.
While the Boers are fighting desperately,
across the Atlantic a military-political, com
edy is being performed. War was declared.
As soon as tho Colombian troops fhot to kill,
Venezuela suddenly announced that nobody
thought of war and the Venezuelan Minister
in Paris was ordered to explain to Europe.
While it is true that the American press is
inclined to mislead Europe regarding Western
affairs, it must.be remembered that President
Castro'3 ..attack, was reported by., a French
warship. Tho assertions of the modem Fal
staff are futile.
The Klelne Journal, under the heading,
"An Imaginary War," says:
BERLIN, Oct. 6.â The Hamburgische
correspondent publishes the surprising
statement that the Venezuelan Consul in
Hamburg, whose authority is the Ven
ezuelan Minister in Paris, declares the re
ports of war and revolution from South
America to be false and alleges that peace
is undisturbed.
Further, he says President Castro be
lieves such iumors are spread by the
United States in order to sidetrack Euro
pean interests likely to be obstructive to
the endeavors of the United States in
South America.

at Asbury Methodist Church. Bishop W.
W. Duncan officiated at the sacrament
service, .which preceded the announce
ment of the appointments to the various
pastorates within the conference juris

Bishop Duncan urged the clergymen, no

reward for service only came with hard,
continuous labor and that they should
exercise every faculty, they possessed to
uplift the people among whom they were
sent to work. The assignments for the
conference year are as follows:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 6.
The sum of $1500 was given by mem
bers of the First Congregational Church
of Chelsea. This is Die church of which
Miss Stone is a member.
The firm of Kidder, Peabody & Co.,
which is handling the funds, kept its of
fice open to-day. Late in the afternoon a
statement of the day's receipts was
made, the total being $4325 85, with $640
additional in pledges.
At the Park-street Church Rev. Dr.
Withrow pleaded the case of Miss Stone
strongly, assuring his hearers that if the
money is not used for her release it will
be returned to the donors, as the chances
are "that the United States Government
will make the Turkish Government pay a
heavy indemnity for the outrage."
At the Shawmut Congregational Church
Rev. W. T. McKlween said that while he
did not \u25a0wish to discourage the present
movement for I.Iiss Stone's release yet the
whole thing appeared to him to establish
a bad precedent. He thought there must
be some efficacy in a first-class battleship
with decks cleared for action. In his
opinion the brigands were playing a game
of bluff and had no idea of assassinating
their prisoners.
Rev. Dr. Lorimer at Tremont Temple,
Rev. John Galbraith at the Broomfield
Methodist Episcopal Church and Rev. S.
E. . Herrlck at the Mount Vernon Church
also presented the appeal, and action was
taken in other churches. Dr. Herrick's
Congregation subscribed $175, but other
pastors asked donors to send their sub
.scriptions direct, to .Kidder, Peabody &
Co. '
BOSTON, Oct. 6â Just how much money
has been given for the ransom of Miss
Ellen Stone, the American Board mission
ary held captive by. brigands in Bulgaria,
is not known to-night. Those directing
the effort in her behalf hope the response
throughout the country will be very lib
eral. In Boston and vicinity the amount
on hand from a number of. # sources
reaches nearly $30,000, and there is a host
of churches to hear from. To-morrow
morning's mail is expected to bring in
many thousands of dollars additional,
making it possible for Boston alone to
raise more than one-third of the total
amount, which is 5150,000.
The urgency of the case of Miss Stone
brought together the members of the pru
dential committee of the American board
for two hours to-day. Later the commit
tee issued a statement based upon the
views of President Samuel B. (Japen of
the board and the secretary, Rev. Dr.
Judson Smith, as the result of their visit
to Washington yesterday.
Both gentlemen had interviews with
President Koo3evelt and the officials of
the State Department. It was made plain
to them, they lold the prudential commitr
tee, that the only certain way to secured
the release of Miss Stone and save her
life would be the payment of the ransom.
The committee was informed that the
Government, by reason of the restriction,
is unable to pay the ransom. The com
mittee was also made aware of the fact
that the American board has no money
with which to save Miss Stone. The only
practical way, therefore, was shown to be
a popular subscription, which has al
ready been started. The committee heart
ily approved this and began sending notes
to many parts of the country urging sub
scriptions. The committee says that in
view of the spirit with which the appeal
is received there is strong grounds for
the hope that the amount will be obtained
speedily. In every way the board will
co-operate both by gift and by solicita
tion. President Capen says that the Gov
ernment at Washington, both the Presi
dent and the State Department, have
done and will continue to do all in their
power to procure the release of Miss
Stone.
LONDON. Oct. 6.â "Another mission has
been destroyed in the Hsing district."
says a dispatch from Hongkong to the
Times. "Tho movement resembles the
Boxer rit=ins."
The settlement of the indemnity ques
tion arrived at Is set forth in article 6.
This article reads:
On May 89, 1901. an imperial edict was Issued
consenting to the payment of on Indemnity
to the various powers, to the total sum of
haikwan taels 430,000.000. Interest on this sum
will be at 4 p6r cent, payments to be divided
into thiny-nine anr.ual installments. Principal
and interest on each installment is to be in
pold. caluclated on exchange of time and
j.eriods arreeJ upon. The first installment is
tn De en January 1, 1902; interest to commence
oa July 1. 1901. The Chinese Government may
calculate the first six months' ir.tererest dowii
to the end of December. 19C1, and then begin
frcm January 1. 1K2. but this interest must be
paid within three years and also calculated
on a basis of 4 per cent per annum.
Article 13 relates to the establishment of
a new Foreign Board. It prescribes that
in future all official correspondence be
tween foreign Ministers and the Chinese
Government shall be in French.
By article 11 China consents to free com
merce and navigation in the country, a
most important concession to the United
States, Great Britain and other commer
cial nations.
The protocol consists of twelve articles,
tr.e ftrst and third relating to the missions
cf Prince Chun and Nu Xing, vice presi
dent of the Board of Revenue, to proceed
ua Germany and Japan to express imper
ial apology for the murders during the
r'.oxer outbreak of the German Minister
ar.d the Chancellor of the Japanese lega
tion.
The second article requires the punish
tr.er.t of the chief instigators of the out
break. Article 4 requires the issuance of
an imperial edict forbidding for a period
cf two years the importation, as well as
the manufacture in China, of all arms
and munitions of war.
China cedes by article 7 an area of land
in Peking for the independent use of the
legations of the various powers and per
mits steps to be taken for its defense and
the retention of guards. She also agrees
to the razing of Taku and all forts. The
imperial Government consents to the pro
mulgation of edicts, to be posted for a
space of two years, forbidding under pain
or decapitation all societies which have for
their object hatred and enmity against
foreign countries.
convention has been received by the State
Department ar.d will be laid before the
Senate for action when Congress meets in
December.

OFFERS INSULT
TO UNCLE SAM
Thirdâ This neutrality is guaranteed by
the United States alone, and other mari
time powers are not invited to participate
in such guarantee. Great Britain is in
ferentially one of the guarantors, be
cause she is a party to this treaty.
Fourthâ In case of war the United
States reserves the right to take 6uch
steps for its own protection as it may
deem proper.
It will be seen that the new treaty meets
the principal objections which were of
fered to the old Hay-Pauncefote conven
tion and which led to its rejection by the
Senate. While the principle of neutrality
is asserted the United States, alone guar
antees that neutrality, and no European
powers are invited to give their assent
to it.
CHICAGO, Oct. 6. âWalter Wellman, In
a special to the Record-Herald from
Washington, says: The United States
and Great Britain have reached an agree
ment concerning the isthmian canal ques
tion, and a new treaty will be presented
to' the Senate for its ratification early in
the coming session. I am now able to
give the substance of this treaty. It pro
vides: ....
Firstâ For the abrogation of the old
Clayton-Bulwer treaty in toto.
Secondâ For the neutrality of the isth
mian canal, in case one be constructed
by the United States, open in time of
peace to ships of all nations upon equal
terms. . â¢
Special Dispatch to The . Call.
Attorney Samuel C. Dunham arrived
here yesterday to appear as a witness
against Judge Xoyes. He says that thft
feeling is very bitter against Noyes and

Ex-United States District Judge John
son, formerly of Circle City. Alaska but
latterly one of the attorneys of the Pio
neer Mining Company, will be another
witness against Noyes. Kenneth M. Jack
son, another of the Pioneer Mining Com
pany's attorneys, who testified at the Mc-
Kenzie trial held here last winter, arrived
here Wednesday and registered at the
Palace. Mr. Jackson will testify against
the accused members of "the Federal
rine."
George V. Borchsenius. Judge NoyeV

W. T. Hume. City Attorney of Nome.
also arrived Wednesday. He. too, has
been subpenaed to be a witness at the
trial. Attorney W. H. lletson. who was
foremost in the fight to end the McKenzie
regime in Nome, will be called upon to
testify. It is thought that the trial will
last at least two weeks. In the mean tlmÂ«
District Judge Nickerstrom is on the
bench at Nome and judging from the
notices In the Nome papers he Is giving
entire satisfaction.
Ex-United States Marshal C. I* Vawter,
who will be one of the principal witnesses
against the Nome court officials, arrived
here a few days ago and registered at the
Russ House. Vawter will testify to the
fact that the writ of supersedeas com
manding Judge Noyes to vacate the no
torious McKenzie receiverships and turn
over several hundred thousand dollars of
gold dust in his possession to the Pioneer
Mining Company, whose Anvil Creek
claims were tied up by flimsy pretenses of
prior location, was not only disregarded
by Judge Noyes and his colleagues but
that they spoke most disrespectfully of
the higher court that issued the writ.
A majority of the witnesses who will
testify against United States District
Judge Noyes, District Attorney Joseph K.
Wood and C. S. A. Frost, representatives
of the Department of Justice of Nome,
Alaska, in the contempt proceedings rend
ing against them in the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals have arrived in this
city. The case against these members of
â¢the Nome Federal ring" will be called
before United States Commissioner Hea
cock this morning at 11 o'clock.
MANILA. Oct. 6.-Major Morris C.
Foote of the Ninth United States Infan
try, who has returned here from Samar,
was in Balingiga the day before the. dis
aster to Company C. He says Captain
Connell had been warned and had taken
what he (Major Footc) considered every
precaution. Information that the plot was
brewing came to Major Foote through a
priest, who said it was the intention of
the natives to attack the garrison from a
point in the rear of the barracks. Orders
were immediately given to demolish the
cockpit. There is intense feeling through
out the army because of the massacre,
which would not be the case to any such
extent had it been the work of ordinary
insurgents. The latter might have been
expected to commit such an outrage.
Feeling is particularly intense in military
circles bfccai-se the authors of the massa
cre were pacificqs, most of - whom had
taken the. oath of allegiance, and many of
whom, including the Presldente of Bal
ingiga, were actually holding offices.
borne of the effects of the affair are al
ready shown at many points, particularly
at Baulan and Calocan, in the province of
liatangas, and Manila, where disaffection
is manifesting itself, although it is noc
likely to be allowed to go far.
On the other hand; the officers and
troops at all the garrisons throughout the
archipelago feel that the disaster conveys
a. lesson to themselves of the necessity
ior increased vigilance.
On the followinc products of the Philippine
Islands, when exported therefrom, there shall
be levied and collected on the gross -weight
thereof export duties as follows: ,
Abaca, raw or wrought hemp, 100 kilos, 75
cents.
Indigo, 100 'kilos, 25 cents.
Indigo employed for dyeing (tin tarron), 100
kilos, 25 cents.
Rice. ICO kilos, $L
Sugar, 100 kilos. 5 cents.
Cocoanuts, fresh and dried (copra), 100 kilos,
10 cents.
Tobacco, manufactured, of all kinds and
whatever origin, 100 kilos, $1 50.
Tobacco, raw, grown In the provinces of
Caigan. Isabella and New Biscay (Luzon
islands), ICO kilos. $1 r.0.
Tobacco, raw. grown in the Visayas . and
Mindanao island, 100 kilos, $1.
Tobacco, raw, grown in other provinces of
the archipelago, 100 kilos. 75 cents.
Certificates of origin of raw tobacco may be
required by the customs authorities when
proof of the place of production is necessary.
NEW YORK, Oct. 6.-A special to the
Journal of Commerce and Commercial
Bulletin from Washington says: The War
Department has just made puollc the re
vised "customs tariff of the Philinpine
archipelago," as enacted on September 17
by the United States Philippine Commis
sion. It takes effect on November 15. The
new tariff ia a revision of the provisions
of general order No. 40, office of the
United States . military governor In the
Philippine Islands, dated October 23, 1899,
and the ..several orders supplemental
thereto and amendatory thereof.
Its promulgation at thi3 time may be
regarded as an indication of the belief
entertained by the War Department that
the Supreme Court will probably take the
same view In regard to the constitution
ality of revenue relations with the Philip
pines as it did in the case of Porto Rico.
That is to say, says the Journal of Com
merce's Washington correspondent, so
long as the Philippines are under the con
trol of the War Department, and in the
absence of specific action to the contrary
by Congress, they are for customs pur
poses regarded as "foreign territory.
The new act, as already noted, takes ef
fect on November 15, but this does not
apply to goods in transit on that date.
Such merchandise, provided it arrives in
the Philippines within sixty days after
November 15, shall be dutiable under the
provisions of the law now existing.
It will be noted under section 13 that
export duties are imposed on certain pro
ducts of the islands, including among oth
ers $1 per hundred kilos for rice, 5 cents
per hundred kilos for sugar, $1 50 per hun
dred kilos for manufactured tobacco of
all kinds and whatever origin, and also
raw tobacco grown in the provinces of
Caigan, Isabella and New Biscay (Luzon
islands). Raw tobacco grown in other
provinces of the archipelago is subject to
an export duty of but 75 cents.
Section 13, which is mentioned as having
been changed in important respects, is
as follows: - .

Ling and Kit. are cousins, notwithstand

count the relatives were loth to permit a
settlement in an American court. They
preferred to deal with the offender in
their own way. With this purpose they
appealed to the Six Companies. Those
who opposed the proposition argued that
as Kit had identified Ling as his assail
ant the law should be permitted to take
its course. The decision of the organiza
tion was that no interference would be
tolerated. ..
At a spirited meeting of the Chinese Six
Companies held last evening it was de
cided that every effort would be exerted
by that organization to assist in the
prosecution of Ho Ling, president of the

to induce the Six Companies to adjust

Santa Rosa Girl Arrested.
Sheriff Borgwardt worked continuously
on the case since Saturday, September 28.
Before leaving Bakersfleld Urquhart left
his address with a fellow employe as 14
Hayes street, in this city. Through this
address Urquhart was arrested. He is an
old resident of Kern County, having been
employed there in 1892 in the Kern County
Land Company's office as stenographer.
He is also an ex-soldier, having served In
the Philippines. He went to Bakersfleld
after being mustered. out and has worked
since in the oil fields as a laborer. Sheriff
Borgwardt will leave Bakersfleld to-day
and will take the prisoner back for trial.
Winthrop was arrested for the crime,
and principally on the testimony of Urqu
hart he was convicted and sentenced to
life imprisonment by ex-Judge Wallace,
who was then -on the Superior bench.
Prior to the kidnaping of Campbell Urqu
hart was arrested by Captain Seymour
for forgery, alleged to have been com
mitted in Stockton, but was acquitted af
ter an examination In the Police Court.
A dispatch from Bakersfleld says that
Urquhart is charged with having forged
five checks; at least that number have
been found so far by Sheriff Borgwardt.
The checks were all numbered the same
and were each for $26. Urquhart, the
Sheriff claims, forged the name of the Pa
cific Coast Oil Company, by J. Matwell,
superintendent, but the name < should -be
J. M. Atwell. Urquhart was discharged
by the company on Friday, September 27,
and went to Bakersfleld.
The checks were all on the Bank of
Bakersfleld, payable to J. Sweet. They
were cashed at several stores, after bank
ing hours, it is alleged. Urquhart's plan,
it is said, was to go into a store and pur
chase some small article, then tender the
check in payment. *
. D. A. Urquhart," who gained considerable
notoriety through' his connection with the
kidnaping of James Campbell, a wealthy
Hawaiian planter, about five \u25a0 years ago,
was arrested yesterday ; by : Detective
Cody "on" ~a warrant from . Bakersfleld
charging him with forgery. O. W. Win
throp,' who figured in the abduction case,
is now doing a life sentence for his par
ticipation in the crime." .'
According to Urquhart, who was the
principal -witness against Winthrop, who
was . then superintendent of .the. Laurel
Hill Cemetery, he was sitting. in the Oc
cidental Hotel when .Winthrop engaged
him in conversation. A few minutes later
Campbell, who was stopping at the hotel,
passed them and inquired of the clerk if
there was any mail for him. Winthrop
asked Urquhart if he knew Campbell, and
when informed that he was a rich plan
ter from the Hawaiian Islands Winthrop
immediately proposed that they abduct
him and hold him for a large ransom.
Urquhart's courage, according to Cap
tain of Detectives Seymour, tailed him
and he refused to entertain the proposi
tion. The following day Campbell dis
appeared and the police were asked to
find him. Through Urquhart they iearntd
of the proposition of Winthrop to kidnap
Campbell and hold him for ransom. While
the entire detective department was out
searching for the missing planter he re
turned Â«to the Occidental Hotel two day,
later and told the story of how he had
been abducted and taken to a house at
4109 California street.

At a lonely place in Fairmount Park
the carriage was stopped by a man who
she said represented himself as D. Clar
ence Gibbony, secretary and attorney of
the Law and Order Society of this city.
This man, she went . on to say, told her
that he had a -warrant for her arrest on
the charge of keeping a disorderly house,
but that the matter could be fixed up. He
was Invited Into the carriage, and the
next moment she was gagged and blind
folded. She was driven somewhere, she
did not know, but she noticed from one
corner of the handkerchief ovef her eyes
that the men paid toll at two toll gates,
and that they took her into a building
where a fire engine and a hook and ladder
truck were standing. She was kept - a
prisoner from Tuesday night until Friday
night without anything to e.at or drink
and was then taken on another loner
drive, blindfolded, to a house where she
was kept from Friday until Monday. In
the latter place the men. who were
masked, stripped her of the Jewelry, and
noney freely. Last Wednesday week, she
;aid, he proposed a drive through Fair
nount Park. He asked her to dress in her
>est clothes and to wear all her diamonds
md other jewelry, because on the return
rom the drive he intended to take her to
he finest dining room in the city, and he
.vanted her to "shine" with the other
women in the place. She accepted, and
:he next day she went out with him in a
carriage with a pair of richly capari
soned horses and with a coachman on the
dox: wearing stylish livery.

the court of the Palace Hotel yesterday.
A picturesque Indian is this chief, and as
he rested his aged frame against a pillar
in the court he had, as usual, a story of
hard times to tell, but a story that would
have never been spoken had his friend of
thirty years, the late Collis P. Hunting
ton, been alive and aware of his plight.
Johnson Sides is stranded in the city.
He wants to go home to Reno, Nev., but
times have changed, and the railroad of
ficials in the "big yellow building" don't
know him and have not the time to look
up his past history. They are too busy
to learn of the many valuable services
this old Indian has done the railway In
the past. A tear trickled down the old
chief's rugged and deeply lined face as
he told how ne has called again and
again at the railroad office asking for a
pass to take him home.
"Old Chief" Huntington and "Old Chief"
Stanford were his friends, he explained.
They knew that good Indians always kept

With other information the .women gave
them, the detectives began to work on
what they believed to be a fairy tale.
They got several clews which led them to
a fire engine house in Fort-Wayne, fifteen
miles from this city." The fire company is
a volunteer organization, and the key to
the place was kept in the, nearest dwell
ing. 5 .The' nearest house was occupied by
a family named FIndlay, and there the
police learned that one of the sons, J.
Knight Findlay,' had been home but little
during the past two weeks. â¢
Getting a description of him,' the police
returned to the city and found the young
man, who is only 21 years of age, in the
office where he is employed. He was
charged with the crime and broke down
and implicated - three, others. Findlay
said that he had impersonated the coach
man; that Sloan, the unemployed .. re
porter, .acted the part ot Attorney Gib
bony; that the barber played the part of
the rich Germantown resident, and that
Wallace, the society editor, had rented' a
house In' Germantown, where Mrs. Good
rich was to have been held a captive.- He
told substantially the same story as that
narrated by the' woman. He: said that
they kept her confined in the fire house
and'then took her to a house at 2556 North
Twelfth street, where Sloan was arrested
yesterday. The plan to keep her in the
Wallace house in Germantown was
abandoned in favor of- the Sloan house.
Sloan, the police say, conceived the whole
plot, and it was he who got the barber
into it. He had asKed Dunlap to play
the part of the rich man and get Mrs.
Goodrich outdoors, so that he could
serve the warrant on her for keeping a
disorderly house. He did not reveal the
real purpose of the scheme to the barber.
All the jewelry was recovered, most of
it having been found In the possession of
Findlay and Sloan, who were wearing
several of the rings. Only one check for
$155 was cashed and most of this meney
was also recovered, i Sloan 'was to have
begun- work on the same newspaper on
which Findlay was employed to-morrow.
Wallace has been society editor of the
paper on â¢which he was employed for only
two weeks. .

For almost a half-century Johnson
Sides has been chief of the Washoe
Piutes. He is looked upon by his own
people as the "Messiah," whose word is
a watchful eye on the railroad track in
their part of the country, and that In
dians could thon ride on the platform of
the blind baggage when they wanted to.
But now railroad officials are voluble in
explaining why Indians cannot ride on
the platform. "Were not Indians often
killed while riding in this manner? If they
cannot afford to pay their fare and sit in
the car they had better stay at home."
This is about the answer old Johnson
Sides received when he applied for a. pass
to go home. '. .
Johnson Sides~ drifted into town the
early part of last week. He came down
from Reno to bring a party of Indians to
pick hops near Santa Rosa. The chief,
who is about 70 years -old, was too feeble
to work, and decided that the best way to
ge't back to his home was to come to San
Francisco and secure a pass from here.
He had to pay $1 50 fare from Santa Rosa
to this city, and when he arrived here he
was nearly out of funds. .
The Southern Pacific Company for
many years allowed all Indians to ride
on the platforms and blind baggage of
the trains. A prominent official stated
in an interview yesterday that an order
was issued sortie time ago instructing
railroad conductors not to allow the In
dians this privilege in the future. So
Johnson Sides must look elsewhere for
means to take him back to his people.
lawâ inspired by the "Great Spirit."
Among the whites he is known as the
"Red Man of Peace," whose good offices
on behalf of the 1 whites since the days of
Winnemucca's terrible raid and battle
against troops and rangers south of the
town that now bears his name are known
throughout the West. ! .
The threatened. uprising in Nye County,
Nevada, several years ago was put down
by Johnson Sides, and many other times
he has turned the savages in his terri
tory from the warpath into the pursuits
of peace. He has traveled with every
Wild West show that ever went on the
road, and the prowess of his bucks has
been the wonder of the palefaces. His
word he has never broken with the
whites, and so long as he livse he will
count the most distinguished citizens of
the "Indian country" as his friends and
when he is dead they will revere his
memory.

Mrs. Hattle Amelia Cloyde, a colored
woman residing at 227 Montgomery ave
nue, prevented Mrs. Johanna Brahn of 10
Vallejo place from murdering her year-old
baby girl witb an ax last night. The
mother is said to cherish a hatred for the
youngster. When drunk she gives way
to her unnatural emotions and is prompt
ed to attempt its life.
According to the story of Mrs. Cloyde
and neighbors, Mrs. Brahn has drank
much since she came into the neighbor
hood four niontns ago. Her periods ol in
toxication, they say. are marked by
extreme brutality to her younger chil
dren â Johanna, a puny child, aged eight,
and Amelia, the baby whose life she tried
to take. The brutal mother explained her
antipathy fur the youngest of her chil
dren by saying that it was illegitimate.
She is reported to have silenced the child's
crving by kicking: it in the stomach, and
at otner times left it for hours without
attention. Johanna, the older girl, was
obliged to bi>g on the streets.
Yesterday afternoon the neighbors were
alarmed hy cries from the room occupied
by the Brahns. At the door Mrs. Cloyde
met the eight-year-old girl dragging her
baby sister out cf the house. The mother,
drunk and frenzied, followed with an ax
in her hand. Little Johanna begged Mrs.
cloyde to take her and the baoy to a
place of safety, iihe said that her mother
on previous occasions had tried to kill the
baby and that miracles only had prevent
ed her from accomplishing her purpose.
Mrs. Cloyde brought the children to the
Hall of Justice, while Officer Robert Sil
ver hastened to the house and arrested
the woman. The policeman ' found that
the family lived in a single room, which
Is dingy and filthy. Mrs. . Brahn was
found fcieeping on the ! floor and heaped
abuse on the officer when he awakened
her. She was taken to police headquar
