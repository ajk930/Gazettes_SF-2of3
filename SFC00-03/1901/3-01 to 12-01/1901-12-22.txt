MOST FAMOUS
CLUB
WOMEN
>H W RS. DENNISTON is a compara
(\/\ tively recent recruit to active
V ' < I club service, but she has de-
I voted herself so steadfastly to
â¢ the work for the past few years
that she has earned for herself a place be
side many who have made a business of
clubs since clubs began.
She has already reached the position of
president of the Forum Club. That is do-
Ing a good deal in a short time." The
Forum Club la a very. busy one and its
office of president means much work.
And that. in turn means that Mrs. Dennis
ton is a busy woman.
She says that she has no time for so
ciety in the. giddy and gadding sense ol
the word. Moreover, she adds, club life
takes the place of society. And here is a
point that club women everywhere are
dwelling uporv
"Club meetings take the place of calling
and are an improvement," she says.
"Women see each other, are brightened
and freshened by contact, and to far more
advantage than by the system of a round
of calls, stand-up receptions and after
noon teas. A social and literary club
such as the Forum is gives women not
only the pleasure of social intercourse, but
the benefit of instruction. Not instruc
tion in a laborious sense; but the kind
that does not overtax busy women who
have many duties at home."
Mrs. Denniston' s many . duties are not
only at home but abroad as well. She is
not satisfied with being president of the
Forum, but is an active member of the
Corona Club. Besides' that, she keeps up
with church work, for she is devotedly re
ligious.
"Religion conies first," she : says. "The
Ideal woman must be true to her belief,
to her chorch. This is one. side of her,
It is one great factor in her complete
ness. ' .-. r â¢/â  . â¢;
"After being religious, she must be do
mestic. She must be a home-maker, both
for the sake of the home and of herself.
The nation needs homes, it needs â  homes
â where its young voters may be trained.
That suggests my ideas on voting which'I
am going to pass by at present.
"Besides the fact that the homes need
women with hearts to watch over each
one of them, the women need the homes.
"We cannot be complete , unless we have
that influence. If a woman is not naturally
domestic she should cultivate the trait.
She is unfeminine without it and her char
acter lacks one of : Its most important
foundation stones. I love my friends and
I believe strongly in social intercourse,
but the kind of. society that keeps women
away from their homes most of their wak
ing hours is ruinous to domesticity. A
life that is made up of hurrying from one
party to another, from reception to dinner
and from dinner. to dance, is a life that
cannot lead to any great and deep happi
ness. ,â  1 .:" l ~ ; :

"The Best Known Club . "Women on the Pacific Coast f" Do you
know who they are? Or, in knowing who they are, have you ever

it. It must be a beautiful garden in which
she plants and weeds and trains. After
she has passed the age of school or col
lege life, we have the woman's club which

SOME UP-TO-DATE SALAD HINTS.
r^f GOOD sized bowl is the first essential of salad making. With this well
f\ ooled, the salad leaves fresh, crisp and dry, without blemish and perfectly
1â4 clean, the mixing presents but little difficulty. Very little oil is required for
V, I a plain salad. The oil should be poured first upon the salad leaves, anl
JL these lightly tossed until they are coated with oil. The other in&redients
being added and the salad again lightly tossed, the product will be a dish evenly
seasoned, with no undressed leaves on top while tho others are soaking in a
strong dressing below. " .
For salad sandwiches pepper grass and water cress should be dipped In French
dressing or salted vinegar before using, shaken dry, and placed between thin
slices of bread and butter.
Soft, mild cheese is used In making a Welsh sandwich, which is an appe
tizing accompaniment to a green salad. Two parts of the cheese are rubbed to
gether with one part of .butter, the former first having been flavored with mus
tard and a herb vinegar. . The mixture Is spread between thin slices of bread.
Green peas mashed very soft are excellent to give color and consistency to
a fish dressing. The juice of spinach or other salad herbs will give a dellcato
Bhade of green to a, mayonnaise. The pounded coral of the lobster mixed
Bmooth with a little oil and added to a mayonnaise will give a good red color
to a fish drfssing, and cooked beet juice or deeply colored fruit Juices will color
an ordinary mayonnaise.
Chopped herbs of any kind of which the flavor Is desired make the mayon
naise tartare. Chopped onions or their Juice, chopped olives, chives, cucumber
pickles and capers added to a p'n'n dressing transforms it into the tartare.
, For the camperâ and some people like the salad for the tableâ there is a salad
dressing prepared with bacon fat. It is convenient as well as appetizing for the
man or woman living under primitive conditions. Thin slices of bacon or even
of ham fat are tried out, strained and two-thirds of the fat thus obtained is com
bined with one-third vinegar and is used in the proper proportion with green
salads. .' x
Sour cream makes an excellent dressing, and the most fastidious objector to
cream would never recognize it If not Jet into the secret. The cream must not
be too* old. The juice of half a lemon, two teaspoonsful of vinegar, a good
pinch of cayenne pepper, a' teaspoonful of gait and a teaspoonful of sugar are
added to a cupful of thick, sour cream uud beaten together thoroughly. It ia
an excellent dressing for tomatoes and (old vc. .ubk-s, and can be used with
a celery and. apple salad.
clubs that exist nowadays and are being
increased and varied all the time. If a
woman has an especial talent for one lino
of study she can find a chance to develop
it in some of our many clubs. There are
those .who devote themselves to literature,
others to art, still others to music. OnÂ©
may study languages or social science
through them. Few women have time to
make n deep study of any of these things,
but the club work is not heuvy.. The com
plete woman could seldom go very far
Into any scientific or artistic study, for the
complete woman usually has children to
rear, and it Is only after these are grown
up and have left her protection that her
opportunity comes for profound npplica
tlon to study.
"The ideal woman should have good
health. It is not safe to make too sweep
ing assertions, but there is a temptation
to say that a woman cannot fulfill her
usefulness in life without it. Of course
this is not absolutely true. We all know
of women who have fought a life battle
against sickness and at the same time
have accomplished as much as or more
than other women of fine physique. But
this, is only by way of exceDtion; it mere
ly proves the rule. The rule is that a sound
mind likes best to dwell in a sound body.
"I like the woman who takes plenty
of good out-of-door exercise. She is the
more ready after it to come indoors and
apply herself to mental work. I like the
beauty that comes as a result of breath
ing good air and plenty of it; of walk
ing in the sunshine; of riding, of playing
golf. We have not all time for a great
deal of this sort of thing, but no matter
how busy our lives are we should find
time for some of it. The club woman's
busy life keeps her going a great deal.
and if she would often walk instead of
yielding to the temptation that a street
car offers she would go home to write her
club paper with clearer thoughts, or go
to her club to read it with more spirit
and enthusiasm."
Mrs. Denniston is not a suffragist. Nor
Is she exactly an "anti." She rather
shrinks from the issue which she feels
Is sure to come. "If women come to
vote," she says, "I suppose I shall take
my place among them and try to vote
intelligently and honestly; but I doubt
if we as women or the nation as a whole
will be any better off for suffrage. I
don't see why we can't do enough for
the country by educating our boys."
This is what you would expect of her,
for she does not look like a suffragist,
although few of them do for that matter.
She is entirely womanly in the strong
sense of the word. She is large, of as
fine physique as that abstract woman
whom she admires, but there is nothing
but femininity in her strength. Her hair
is dark, her eyes are big and gray and
frank, her figure is San Franciscan. Sho
is fond of the good things of this life, es
pecially driving and music, and she finds
her happy part of the year during the
opera season. She says that she is a
musician In the sense that she enjoys
music with her whole soul, although she
does not execute.
There is a broad enough woman for
you, don't you. think so?

BEAUTY
QUEST
Facial Development lor Rounding* out Hollow Cheeks
and Cultivating Beautiful Curves.
(Copyright 1901 by P. Smith.)
TO round out hollow' cheeks, obviate
flabblncss and cultivate beautiful
curves is the object of facial de
velopment. The first step in this
direction is to learn how to exer
cise the muscles of the face. We all know
how to develop the muscles of the arms,
for example, by certain movements learn
ed at the gymnasium; to train the tissues
of the face to lines of beauty is quite as
easily learned and us important.
As we grow older muscles become de
pressed, and need cultivation to keep them
strong, iirm and free from llabbiness.
Then, too, many youthful faces, although
round 'find plump, yet are not beautiful,
or even pretty. They aro all llesh and no
muscle. It is rather a common delusion
that one can gain beauty by gaining a
little more fat. This is a fatal mistake.
The lines of beauty* will be found only
where the muscles are plump and firm. '
Going to work systematiclly, the would
be Venus seats herself in loose garments
at her toilet table facing her mirror, and
without so much as "by your leave,"
daintily puts her ringer in her mouth and
gently, firmly presses her cheek outward
in every conceivable direction; the thumb
and forefinger in the meantime, on the
outside of the cheek, are rubbing the flesh
upward, with deep pressure, which stimu
lates the blood, bringing it to the surface.
First one cheek and then the other must
undergo this treatment. Then, removing
the linger from the mouth, the muscles
under each eye are contracted or bunched
up, the thumb and forefinger pressing
downward gently, while the muscles are
contracting or bunching up; this offers the
desired resistance â the pressure downward
with thumb and iinger. Relax the mus
cles at once and then contract them again;
alternate this contracting and relaxing,
Unit one cheek and then the other, until
the muscles are tired. This Is one way to
round out hollow cheeks, give tone to
muscles and gain beauty of shape. Still
there is another way.
Rolling the Cheeks.
The next step In facial development Is to
roll the cheeks, which will also invigorate
the muscles. Place the palms of the
hands firmly on the cheeks, and roll them,
the movement always being upward. Roll
or rub deeply, so as to get at the muscles;
rubbing" the skin only make.s it loose. Use
any good cream; this facilitates the deep
rolling of the muscles and nourishes the
skin. Not only roll the cheeks, but knead
the paste into the skin.
An Inventory of the Features With
Helpful Suggestions.
Having arrived by this careful treat
ment to a proper degree of plumpness of
cheek and lirmness of muscle, the next
thing is to take an inventory of the fea
tures.
My nose. One thing is certain, a woman
cannot be beautiful unless she have a
good nose; another thing is equally cer
tain, thero is never <t handsome nose
without the company of other good look
ing features; another thing is equally ab-
Bolutely certain, the nose is the vital
point of a woman's beauty. Such being
the facts in tho case, It Is a solemn thing
to contemplate that noses are born, not
made, and we must, as a rule, submit to
the Inevitable. Noses, to be sure, are
made over, very poor specimens emerg
ing from the making over process fairly
respectable features. But it is only in
cases where tho nose is a blot upon the
fuce that heroic measures are advocated.
The ordinary, every-day nose may often
be improved, although it was the moth
er's duty to attend to this matter in in
fancy. â¢ From babyhood upward tho nose
should always be rubbed downward; even
a snub nose may bo improved in shape
by this process. Where the nostrils are
very wide open the nose can be gently
pressed together with . the lingers and
held in this position for a few moments
at a time, the process being repeated at
intervals. When blackheads appear, and
they never will if the skin is kept healthy
by daily baths, an excellent wash is made
of-
Flowers of sulphur 1 teaapoonful
Glycerine 1 teaspoonful
ltose water H Pint
Bathe the nose at night with warm
water and then with this lotion; in the
morning wash the nose again with warm
water, followed by a dash of cold water.
Keep up this treatment until the black
heads disappear. If one has a red nose
in winter she will do well to take care
when she is out in the cold to keep her
mouth shut and breathe through her
nose; also not to take hot soups or hot
drinks soon after coming In from tho
cold.
My eyes. As we grow older the ball of
the eye flattens; to preserve the normal
shape of the eye as long as possible mas
sage or rubbing of the eyeball is resorted
to. Rub the eye toward the nose, never
by outward motion; this does much to
keep the ball round and well developed,
ami should be an occasional toilet duty.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Too much tampering with the eyes should
bo avoided. For an "eye restcr" once a
week or so bathe the eyes in rather hot
water to which a drop or two of cam
phor has been added. Bathing with rose
water is also recommonded. If the eyes
have become irritated through excessive
use a. lotion should be made of rosemary
flowers steeped in distilled water. Steep
the flowers for several days, then strain
and add equal quantities of rose water
and brandy. To remove a feeling of dry
ness make a tea leaf poultice by making
ordinary tea. After straining put the
leaves between two pieces of soft muslin
and keep on the eye for some hours. Up
to forty year3 of age It Is a good plan to
bathe the eyes twice dolly with cold
water; after that age bathe them night
and morning with hot water, followed by
cold. Eyelashes* preserve the eyes from
dust, wind and glaring light. It Is, there
fore, not vanity to endeavor to improve
their quality and quantity. If the eye
lashes are thin apply this lotion twice
daily:
White wax 4 os.
Glycerine 1 ox.
Tincture of cantharides Mi oz.
Sulphur sublimated ...' % oz.
Stroking the eyelashes in an upward
direction gives them a tendency to curl
up. Although it aids the growth of e3'i-*
lashes to clip the ends carefully In child
hood an adult should on no account tam
per in this way with the lashes, as it on".j
makes them grow coarse and stubby. Tlu

ner eyeiasnes as witn a ran, ana some
times the upper and lower seemed to en
tangle for a moment and be In difficulties,
from which you wanted to extricate them
in the tenderest manner.
My mouth. Almost any one can have
a pretty mouth If she knows the proper
way to close It. It is not to allow tha
under lip to protrude. That the under
lip should obviously extend beyond tha
other Is excessively ugly. But it never
should recede. It should a trifle more
than touch tho upper Up; this makes the
real Cupid's bow, and the prettiest shaped
mouth. Syrian women have the most
beautiful mouths In the world, and Lady
Isabel Burton used to say that sho
learned from a Syrian woman the proper
way to close her mouth. Although the
Cupid's bow Is the traditionally accepted
mouth of beauty, because, for one rea
son, It gives an arch expression to the
face, ttfere are other mouths equally as
pretty, and they may be large or small,
but the perfect mouth is neither large
nor small, nor too thin about the Ups,
with a fresh, brilliant redness.
Bathing the lips with alum water keeps
them soft and In good color; follow thU
with an application of cold cream. Once
in a -while a few drops of cologne may bÂ«
rubbed In the lips; follow this also with
an emollent. Cologne or alum water
used too frequently renders the skin hard
and brittle and likely to crack. Friction
with a rough towel, which brings the
blood to the surface, helps to keep the
lips red. This, however, should not bo
a frequent practice. â¢ Passing the tongue
over the lips to moisten them is an in
jurious habit, as the saliva, always more
or less acid, shrivels the skin. Many
really nice mouths are spoiled by a hard
line, edging, at it were, tho lip, this be
ing usually caused by cold winds and
frosty weather; rubbing the lips with
sweet oil or a toilet cream la beneficial.
My chin. To develop the muscles of
the chin and prevent it having a weak,
flabby appearance, press the lower Up
upward by depressing the chin, as in the
act of pouting as strongly as you can;
crook the forefinger so as to form a
half circle of it; put the half circle form
over the point of the chin, just below
the mouth, and press downward lightly
with the tins*,. ~ Â«i ihe same time'
you are pressing the lip upward strongly,
enough to push the finger up with it..
After contracting the muscle hard
enough to force tne linger upward relax
it Instantly.
3THE NEW YEAR CALL
AND
THE NEW YEAR GOWN
THE NEW YEAR CALL;
THE NEW YEAR GOWN
Both will be revived this
year and many beautiful Nov
elties in the way of Dress and
Dress Trimmings will usher in
the year 1902 â Costumes to be
worn at the New Year "Occa
sion" of the Countess de Cas
tellaneâPreparations for the
White House reception â Miss
Helen Hay's charming but
subdued crepe de. chines â Mrs.
Gebhard's new gowns.
/"|^*O be at home on New Year's day is
I a delightful occupation for any
1 woman. It gives her an opportun
1 ity, while extending the "greetings
JL of the new twelvemonth, to wear a
sown designed for the occasion, one that
shalf be not only fresh, but typical of
the styles of the coming-year.
A typical New Year gown must com
bine these Qualities:"
It must be in style.
Its material must be one of the stai^
dards. ' .
It must be of the full dress order.
It must have characteristics that appeal
to men callers as well as to women.
It must be becomingly chic â  .
It must be of good color.
It must "light up" well.' ;
The New Year gown is so indicative of
the fashions of the coming year that if ail
the New Year., dresses of all the women
of fashion were gathered togetherjin one
fashion exposition there would be shown
the modes that will prevail the 'coming
year. The French have a way of turning
out positive novelties for the occasion. -
and in the New Year drawing-room of
the Countess de. Castellane there are
gathered representative gowns that show |
"all the little touches that mark a change
of style. For it is at this time that to*
fashions really change. .
A Conventional Gown. â¢;
The conventional New Year gown may
be high in the neck, for in this country
one throws open one's house and all thÂ«
world is bidden enter. Besides this, the
gown is put on early in the day, and un
less the house is to be darkened to simu
late night the low-necked gown would not
bo in good taste. . ...
The skirt of the gown should be en
train. We are returning to the court
train, and the skirt can scarcely be too
long. It should drag upon the floor many
a foot, and be stiffened so that, instead
of a draggly tail, spiritless and aesthetic.
It stands out a proud follower of the
gown.
Besides being, trained, the skirt should
be long in front, so that it touches the
ground just where the slippers peep
forth, and if rightly planned it should
also touch upon the sides. It is the hard
est thing in the world to hang this lull
dress pown, and in the making of it many
a modiste "falls down" Hopelessly. Prop
erly done, it is a conception of styic, a
consummation of art.
A gown -that caught the eye and rivote-1
It was made Â»for a New York debutante
who will receive with her mother for the
first time this New Year's day. She is a.
mature looking girl, rather plump, of the
blonde type, almost pretty, with a Wll
heirnina freshness and of the charmingly
vivacious order which enables its owner
to wear gowna that could not be carried
off by u plrl who drosses herself stiffly.
This studying of character, as it were.
Is an important thing for any woman who
is planning a New Year gown for herself.
If she be" listless and lackadaisical, let
her select a frock that is interesting in '
itselfâ one that is a study without its
owner; a gown that would be good if
hung upon a clotheshorse. There are
plenty of these dresses in these days,
made up in a composite of lace and silk,
satin and jewels, that, while not too rich
to be in good taste, are certafnly of great
interest from a study standpoint.
On the other hand, if a girl be vivacious
and interesting in herselfâ it ia difficult to
differentiate, but everybody understands â
then she need not rely so. entirely upon
her frock. She can go into set aud con
ventional styles if she so pleases.
A ITevr Year Ideal.
A New Year gown made for the debu
tante who is to receive with her mother
has two bodices, one for day and one for
evening. Between day and dark, when
there is a lull, the young woman will
steal away and slip into the evening
waist.
In Gotham old New York and new are
mingled, und there is a division between
the New Year call of day and the one of
night. The old New Yorkersâ those who
niade calls upon one's grandmotherâ are
the ones who call before 4 o'clock, begin
ning to drop in at 11 in the morning. In
the evening, well mellowed, they go homo
for a quiet evening around the aearth
etone.
The New Yorkers that belong to the
newer days, on the contrary, start out at
6, as though going to an afternoon tea,
and until midnight, and after, they make
merry with greetings. Between 4 and 5
there is a lull in the home, and the girl
who wishes to change her gown can slip
into the decollete bodice. â¢ â â  â¢ â '
The debutante's gown is built of flow
ered Bilk, not of the thin order, but ex
tremely heavy; brocaded silk would per
haps be a better word, though the flowers
do not look entirely like the brocade
which one understands as such. The
groundwork is a pale gray, and growing
all over it are great pink tulips, life sles,
with long yellowish green stems. The
flowers are closely clustered near the hem
of the gown, but grow scarcer toward the
waist line. . - â¢â¢;â â¢â  , ;â¢
To accomplish this marvel and maka the
gown look as though it were a pattern
dress there is recourse to embroidery.
Embroidered tulips are used upon the
hem of the skirt, and between the bro
caded flgures the embroidered flowers
grow thick.
, A Long Train. s
There is no other trimming upon the
skirt, which has a long train, round and
stiffened to hang out Btralght from the
back of the waist, where it has its start
'lhe skirt shows a lining of crocus col
ored taffeta and around- the foot there is
the little plaiting of pink chiffon, with
white lace over it, for that dainty foot
touch so much liked.
With the high necked bodice for day
wear there U a little bolero Jacket of flow
ered Bilk, sleeveless, with a deep pointed
collar overlaid with lace. A full lace
rutili* tidpeu the collar.
Under this little blouse bolero there la
worn a shirt waist of chiffon. This is very
full and th*> chiffon Is shirred over silk.
The sleeves art* cut in princess fashion;
that is, in full puffs with bands of silk
running around the arm, strapping down
tho chiffon, to make elbow puffs. A deep
fall <>t ohlffon overs the hand.
The stock la one of those simple things
In pink panne with ribbon traced upon it
to make u pretty design. The stock can
be easily managed these days for it needs
flower Or a few ft PP U( l uea
A stock showing much quiet taste was
worn by Mrs. Frederick Gebhard. It was
made of box plaited silk with a panne vel
vet rose appliqued upon each one of tho
box plaits. At the back the plaits flared,
while the sides wero stitched flat. In a
gown whose sweeping length will not per
mit her to take her time-honored position
in front of the mantel, but will force her
into the very center of the room, in order
that ' its yards may be uninterrupted, â  a
very fashionable woman will receive her
New Year guests.
As well be out of the world as out of
fashion, and she who cannot receive In
this manner can come very near to it by
putting on her best gown and bidding: her
guests welcome from. the mantel.
There is to be a general revival of the
New : Year call this year, and not only of
the call, but of all Its attendant customs.
Front doors will be opened by small
members of the family, the ushers will be
impromptu onesâ college boys home for
the holidays â tho luncheon table will be
visited by the young women who assist
the hostess, and tho whole will be done In
that old-tlmey fashion which makes one
think of George Washington and Martha.
Tho "first lady" of those days gave her.
guests only tea cakes and wine, but her
train was long and her manner cordial
and accompanied with some ceremony.
The parlors of the dressmakers have
looked like the show rooms of the import
ers of late, for there have been spread
out upon the carpets yards and yards of
material, all attached to skirts to form
long trains. Not pointed were the trains,
not soft and swisliy, as a little seamstress
put it, but long and stiff, stately and
space-defying.
A crinolined trainâ for many of tho
trains are crinollnclâ is a thing terrifying
to the woman who has never tried to walk
in it. but, once on, the figure adapts Itself
to the train with amazing swiftness. If
well stiffened it hangs out from the feet
and is really not a difficult thing to man
age. in spite of its apparent impossibility,
in a small room.
But the soul of woman worries not so
much over the length of the train and its
possibility of management as over Its ex-pense. The long or court trains as they
nre now seen in the handsomest establish
ments are things* of great cost, and the
loftiness of their prices, together with
their beauty, clothe them with something
of the majesty of mysticism.
Who enn possibly afford such a gown?"
was the question asked by a young wom
an hs she paused in front of a great glass
show window In which a waxen beauty,
life size, simpered nbovo the draporlrs of
satin and chiffon, of lace and ribbon, of
velvet roses nnd silk, nil combined in one
beautiful whole that made up an evening
gown.
"Who, indeed?" echoed another girl,
whose eyes dwelt upon the sweeping train
Jn whoso lengths there were dollars plain
ly shown.
In the shops as a New York gift to all
the world of women there are shown silks
and satins in brocades and figures, many
of them recently brought out for display.
These bring the long train, if not within
easy reach, ceitalnly within speaking dis
tance of the woman who aspires.
The New Silks.
Time was, not so long ago, when the
cost of a gown could be plainly discerned
py glancing at it, but now it is. to a cer
tain extent different. The new silks are
so beautifully finished and so prettily fig
ured that one is really deceived In them,
and might easily be mistaken in thinking
1 ,Â£ m mucn more expensive than they are.
1 here are the Louislne silks, of which
one never tires in praise, artd there arc
the empire stuffs, that are so pretty with
the r bouquets and their floral baskets,
their WFealhs and their little market
bunches; and there are the Persian silks,
which really grow more and more won
derful as the world goes by. .
But besides these there have recently
been manufactured many handsome silks
'â¢ 'or beauty of coloring and delicacy
of design will probably never be excelled
These are sold for small prices, some of
them well within a dollar a yard, and are
so good in stamp and texture that they
can be made up very simple, often with
out any trimming but their own figures.
A gown of one of these silks, made en
train for a New Year reception, could
easily be put together In a few days, cer
tainly In a week. The waist would re
quire nothing beyond cutting after a sim
ple shirtwaist pattern. Any good summer
model would do. It must blouse a little
If of figured silk, If it would be in the very
newest Parisian style; and must be
brought down to a rounding point in
front, piecisely as though it were a cot
ton shirtwaist.
It is very smart to veil such a blouse
waist In figured chiffon. Any simple chif
fon with small figure will do and the cut
tine should be .performed u&on ttwi lines
of the outside waist, though the two nvn
made separately, one over the other. Ti.o
figure from the under Bilk shows through
the outer waist of chiffon with very soft
effect.
Cutting a Bodice.
The cutting of a decollete bodice Is a
simple thing, but the amateur Is opt to
do her work not wisely but too thorough
ly. The neck should be rounded and cut
delicately, not nearly as low as one de?
sires the waist to be, but at least two
inches higher. When completed the nick
will sag and the seams will give so that
the desired lownoss ia obtained.
The cutting of a neck too low Is a fault
so common to the amateur that it can bo
always looked for, but In the hands of a
real modiste such a mistake 1* or ocSUrs.
Of course nn error of thlÂ» lÂ»..d robs a
bodice of its beauty completely. It gives
the wearer, too, an uncomfortable feel
ing as though her garments were coming
off.
The skirt of a handsomely figured ma
terial can bo entirely plain with a iopg
rounded train and a ruffle under the foot
to keep It out. The belt may be a soft
crush belt.
The sash will play no unimportant part
in the season's gowns. It will be made of
chiffon and worn in one of many ways
all thoroughly approved. Miss â¦ May,
whose engagement to Payne Whitney has
been recently announced, wears a black
crepe de chine gown with a sash of binck
silk bordered with a very narrow double
box plaiting of chiffon. This is set-entire
ly around the edge of the-sash. !
Another form shows the wide sash all
of chiffon without a border. This is
wound once around tho waist and once
around the figure, the lower winding com
ing under the hips and veil down tho
front. It is finally tied at one side.
Still another of the long sashes of the
season Is tied directly In front, but this
should be worn only by a very slender
figure.
There are new methods of tying the
sash. One shows it as a chou consisting
of four loops, with long trailing ends.
Another method displays the crossed ends
caught under a pretty pin.
The sash pin Is one of the new features
in this year's jewelry. It is in the form
of a long clasp looking something like a
buckle, but having a fastening at one
side, something like a boa pin, but on a
much more limited scale.
The sash is really a charming feature
of dress and one that will grow more
popular. For the New Year day costume
Its value can hardly be overestimated, for
It has away of beautifying a 'new gown
and of positively glorifying an old one.
The new sash ribbons are the ones that
are velvet dotted. Others are : striped
with, transparent .s,trtpes. , whjlle oi.he.rs
hnve beautiful roses that will admit of a
bit of hand embroidery upon the end*,
which can be finished with fringe.
New Year Handkerchiefs.
After a long period, during which the
pocket, handkerchief was banished from
public gaze and relegated to an Inn^r
pocket, there comes a time when it can
be brought out again. Not only is it now
permissible, but It has -become actually
an object of beauty and part of dresa.
lhe luce handkerchief of two generations
ago was not more necessary to the
woman of those days than the fine little
linen ones nowadays. .
With the New Year gown it must be
carried In the hand, or it may be tucked
In the front of one's corsage, or even
slipped in the sleeve, if that be long. It
can be arranged to hide In the belt with
pretty little ends projecting, or it can be
merely a matter of ornament, of'dalli
ance, for the fingers. The handkerchief
ring is also in process of revival, and may
be soon seen again. A ring, with chain it
is, to which is attached a ring through
which the handkerchief is drawn.
The new linen handkerchiefs are very
small' and of very fine linen. Their bor
der is narrow, and the main claim to
beauty consists of the embroidery that Is
in one corner. This is in the form of a
little wreath, with the initial inside, tho
wreath worked out In colors. Or it may
be a little white silk eagle, with a wreath
beneath it and an initial Inside the
wreath. The family, crest Is very good
upon the corner of the handkerchief, and
can be done "quartered" in full colors, to
make a very brave heraldic design.
Tho 1902 handkerchief Is a trifle that
wins favor. It is a- little linen affair, with
1902 embroidered on one corner. Below
must be one's monogram:
New Year Gloves.
It is- in the height of etiquette to go
without gloves at the New Year reception,
for there is no hand clasp like the bare
one. In one's own home the extended hand
should be gloveless. Still, there are hos
tesses who wear long gloves New Year's
day, .and for them there are the gloves
with handsomely trimmed tops. There is
this about the long gloveâ that It comes
weH up toward the shoulder and sort of
dresses up the arm and Is becoming.
Another has a top trimmed with ap
plique put on to make a still upper part.
A third has a lace top" with the kid cut
out underneath the lace, while there is
another style that has the embroidered
top, the roses coming out in full relief of
color against the kid background.
It is difficult to purchase such gloves
ready made, but they can be ordered to
Bjatch one's cos.tume. >6

Linen Closet That Is a Model of Convenience for the Housekeeper
THE finest linen and plenty of Itâ and

Brummel. The finest linen and

country washing every house mother

linen may not.be of the llnest, she can
take heaps of comfort and pride in Its
care and due arrangement.
A word In the beginning. Ldnen ought
to be for use, not for show. Better the
simplest cloths, fresh from the laundry,
even if something frayed, than the richest
damask yellow with long lying. Indeed.
it ought to be a cardinal rule in every
home that the silver, linen and fine man
ners are to be used every day. Use
brightens and whitens all three and does
not wear them anything like so much aa
lying in wait for company. Use. which is
thus essential, should be also equal. To
insure that, have a drawer apart from
this main linen closet. In it store a two
weeks' Bupply of every linen requisite.
When all its contents have had their turn
take them back to the main closet and
brins others in their stead.
Since a linen closet may be nothing

way in taking down or putting up linen.
To light a closet of any kind, but more
especially a linen closet, the safest thing
is to light a clear glass lantern with wire
guards outside the glass. Swing it by a
light chain pulley some little wayin front
of the shelves. Thus a touch sends It up
or down, throwing the light wherever It
may be needed, '-[ZZ'J.i.
Tho fine Invisible dust which oozes into
every space not hermetically sealed will
get into a linen closet in spite of all pre
cautions. Therefore, wipe off the shelves
of It once -a month with a clean cloth
dipped in boiling water and wrung vefy
dry. As to finish, the shelves may be
merely sandpapered and varnished, but
are better painted white. In damp weath
er open the linen closet almost an hour
each day. Roseleaf sachets give the linen
an exquisitely delicate fragrance. Gather
freshly opened petals and dry them in tho
shade. When thoroughly dry mix with
them half their own bulk of dry lemon
peel and' calamus root, both grated. Strew
the mixture thickly over sheets of wad
ding and tack the wadding between either
cheesecloth or china silk. Fasten the
sachets to the closet walls or lay them
along the shelves. Now and again give
them an hour's sunning. It freshens them
wonderfully and brings out the odor anew.

OOM! Boom! Clang-clang-clang!
then a vivid glare in the fog
hung sky and the blood-quicken-
ing cry of "Fire, Fire!" as the
bell of the old City Hall at
"Washington and Kearny streets rang out
its fearsome message.
Then the rush of many feet, shouts and
the light of lanterns; the sound of clank
ing brass and wheels, and the good city
folk of that time would tumble out <if
bed to see Knickerbocker Engine Com
pany No. 5 dash by on a run. Frequently
the watchers would see the strange sight
of a fair-haired girl clad In fireman's hat
and coat tugging along at the ropes of
the engine or running with the men,
shouting words of encouragement.
Many would Bay as they gazed, "Well,
L.iMe'8 with 'em to-night," or "Look,
there goes Lillie Hitchcock, the daughter
of the fire laddies." For in those* days.
In the last half of the fifties and in the
eixtles, Lillie Hitchcock was truly the gal
lant comrade and Informally recognised
member of Knickerbocker Company No.
5. She had her key to the engine house
on Sacramento street and to the meet
ing-room the same as any other brave
fireman.
She was the daughter of Dr. Hitchcock,
an old resident of San Francisco; a gen
tleman of the eld regime from South
Carolina, who served as a surgeon in the
Confederate army. When the little one
nrrived he was disappointed, for he had
set his heart on the girl being a boy,
but he is reported to have said: "Well,
never mind, we'll do the best we can to
make her a boy." So Lillie came honest
ly by the taste for masculine sports and
pursuits, which she developed frora &
child.
Engine No. 5 was not her first love in
the shape of a fire engine. Across the
street from the Oriental Hotel at Battery
and Bush streets, where the Hitchcocks
made their home when she was a tiny
pirl, was the engine house of No. 4.
This engine had a great fascination for
Lillie and another girl friend, also of the
irrepressible sort, and who is still living
in San Francisco, and together they
planned to get on the right side of the
Bremen. They did it successfully, and
there never was an alarm of fire in that
vicinity but these two small women would
put on red shirts kept for the occasion
and start for the engine house in the hope
of getting a ride on the engine, which they
â oaietlmej would accomplish.
But the best of friends must part, and
great was the wailing when the second
small girl was big enough and mischiev
ous enough to be sent to a San Jose con
vent. Then Lillie's mother sought to nip
In the bud her daughter's love for the
life of a; daring fire laddie, but as well
try to stop the wind from blowing. The
little miss used to pass on her way to
school the er.gine house at 510 Sacramento
street, still standing, then the home of
No. t>, the redoubtable engine of .tho
Knickerbocker Fire Company,-
Theie she used to stop and look with
longing eyes at the brass of the machine;
once she stopped and asked a question,
and the knowledge and bright interest she
cisplayc-d won the hearts of the firemen
of .No. 5, and she has held them to this
day. One of. the members of the com
pany then drove an omnibus for the old
People's line, and would often give tho
little would-be tlreman a lift on the way
to scho<^.
After this confidential basis was estab
lished the fire bell would never ring at
any hour hut the men of No. 5 knew thSit
Lillie Hitchcock would be on the streets
somewhere, watching for them. They all
grew to have a great interest and pride
in their young comrade, and as the years
went on tht attachment increased and
has never decreased on either side.
This continued for some years and the
little girl had grown to the threshold
of sweet sixteen perhaps, when it is said
a gallant lireman. a dashing young fel
low, showed symptoms of having designs
upon the heart of "the daughter of the
fire laddies." Then she was promptly
sent to join the o,ther girl, who had been
missing all the tires for bo long a timo
at the San Joce convent.
' But this girl, who hunted and rode like
a boj- on her father's ranch at St.- He
lena, and handled a gun with the best of
them, was not the young person to en
dure such seclusion without a protest.
She vtry promptly tried the method of
starving herself. This succeeded, and she
was brought home to the Occidental Ho
tel, where her parents were then living.
As she grew nearer to the estate of a
full-fledged young lady, her interest 4 n
her "fireboys." as she called them, grew
to be more and more a part of her llfo.
She kept her fireman's hat and belt upon
a hook or any other convenient p!*Cl
of furniture in her room where ehc coul'l
snatch it up and be off at the first sound
of the fire alarm. More than that, she
secured a badge permitting her -within
the lines at a fire.
It was a hobby carried to extremes
with her, perhaps, but in thcee days it
was considered the thing for ladles to be
honorary members of fire companies. The
Sansome hook and ladder was a grand
affair, numbering- among its members all
the your.g bloods of the town. When they
Kave a grand ball at Music Hall It wai
a social event Ions; to be remembered.
"Number 4" carried for many years on
their engine in parades an apron of red
white and blue silk thrown to them one
Fourth of July by a lady whom they
cheered for wearing it.
On August 17, 1S63. a member's fee of
S100 was paid by the chairman of a meet
ing of the members of Knickerbocker
Engine Company No. 5. at which Lillie
Hitchcock was formally made an honor
ary member cf the company. The amount
of the fee was contributed afterward by
the members of the company and re
turned to the chairman, j That v.*as an
event which she who was thus honored
looks back upon as one cf the pleasant
est of her life, and the anniversary of
which has been suitably recognized by
her ever since. On Christmas day, 1S63,
a beautifully engrossed certificate of
membership, costing the company $90,
was piesented to "the daughter of the
fire laddies" In her mother's rooms at the
Occidental Hotel by Assistant Foreman
Stephen Bor.r.cr of No. 5, who is now ser
geant of noMce here.,
This trade her more than even the idol
of No. 5, and if she could not go to a
fire with them In any other way, she
would often take a carriage and have thf
engine ropes attached to it, and then bid
Ihe driver in her hearty way: "Get up
and drive lil:e a good one, John-" And
off to the fire they would go, the car
riage first, like a triumphal chariot in a
rece, the engine and the cheering fire
men rt-Bhing along in its wake.
The one or two firemen who are left
alive as original members of Knicker
bocker Company No. 5 never tire of tell
ing the story of how one night, when a
SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST
FIRE LASSIE
bie fire was blazing at^Post and Mar
ket streets, Lillie Hitchcock came flying
up the street, distancing her esoort, anÂ«i
clad In evening dress and opera cloak,
fresh from her box at the Grand Opera
house. Eho wanted, a frolic and she got
It. She insisted that she be allowed to
hold the hose pipe, If only for a moment.
The firemen could refuse their loyal com
rade and â¢well-wisher nothing, whensud
denlv the nlr chamber of the englm>
burst, and. the "flrewoman," clad in pur
ple and fine linen, was thoroughly
drenched. Â» -.
But that was a small happening to this
most original of women, who was always
hale fellow well met in her manner to all
her friende. Even as a girl she had a way
of meeting- a fireman, slapping him on the
back cordially and Pinging out to him.
"Why. hello, Jim, how aro you?" Many a
time if even the humblest member of her
beloved No. 5 got into any trouble she
was ready to help him, even to paying a
fine if need bo, though she was never al
lowed to do so.
Many a time too at a fire, after the
firemen'? duty was done, did she have
coffee and eatables furnished for them at
her expense at a nearby restaurant. Her
interest extended to the families of the
men. and many hava been the thoughtful
and kind acts they have on record of her.
Thoughtfulness had always been one of
her characteristics, and all her favor*
were done In no niggardly way, from the
flowers for the 3ick girl, sent In a hand
some ccse as a keepsake, to the generous
check sent as a Christmas gift for a sick
"fire laddie."
In 1Â£G3, Lillie Hitchcock was married to
Howard Colt, a fine looking young fellow,'
afterward crier to the Board of Brokers.
Owing to parental opposition they were
married secretly in this city, and then
went to New York to visit friends. But
with her marriage she did not lose her in
terest in fires and her beloved "No. 5," and
on her wedding day she wore the
small JeweieU pii:, a number five in dia
monds, which no one ever remembers see
ing her without, at home or abroad. In
her diary and on her letters she always
signed her name thus: "Lillie Hitchcock
Colt â 5." For years after her husband's
death, which took place many years ago,
Mrs. Coit lived with her mother at the
Palace Hotel, where the boys of No. 5
always found a warm welcome.
Always on the occasion of anhlversary
or other parades, "the daughter, of the fire
laddies" would appear at her window, clad
in her fireman's coat and hat, and give
the salute to the tramping boys below.
One of tho most prominent decorations of
her drawing room was a large painting
representing the world. On the top of
the globe cat the '"daughter of the fire
laddies" in a fireman's scarlet coat, and
reaching out from everywhere were men
with wine glasses in their outstretched
hands, offering the toast, "To the one wo
man in the world." Some of the most
prominent citizens of San Francisco of
that day were recognisable In the paint-
Ing, which was presented to Mrs. # Coit. A
suitable verse of presentation was written
below the picture. .. ".'
At the yearly banquets of "No. 5" Lillie
Hitchcock would always honor the boys
with at least a brief presence and if that
were Impossible, no matter where In the
world ehe might do, she sent a floral token
of her thought and a letter beginning:
"Dear Number Five."

year or so after its organization. James
H. Cutter, a New Yorker who then had a
store on Front street, was the prime or
ganizer and the first foreman of the com
pany.
They must have been great lady-killers,
those firemen of the early days, for one
may read on their records of 1853 of their
sending an immense bouquet together with
their good wishes to "Kate" Hayes, the
favorite concert singer of the time. The
lady sent back a very pretty note which
was framed as a memento, and now hangs
on the walls at the Association rooms In

The animated teakettle is one of the
mest popular of Japanese fa'ry tale3.
From this originated that trite saying "A
trmpcft !n a teapot." On many decorated
panels and friezes and in Japanese paint
ings the figure of this celebrated teaket
tle is seen with frequency. The story,
boiled down, goes something like this:
Sitting by his fire one night a good
priest, living in the of MorinJI,
was cooking his supp*er~of rice and tea;
the fire flickered and the kettle sang mer
rily as it hung over the coals. After the
ri^e was dispensed and the hearth cleaned
the priest sat warming his hands over
the blaze, when his eyes chanced to fall
on the teakettle and he saw that the
spout looked like a badger's nose. Blink
ing his eyes, he looked again, and saw
four hairy legs and a bushy tail. Then
this compound of half-flesh, half-metal
Jumped off the hook, capered about on th*
floor, beat a tune- on his metal body,
scampered over shelves, books, etc., and
made such a commotion generally that
the good priest was frantic. The next day
he sold the kettle to a tinker, who, hav
ing an original turn, hired a press agent
and heralded the *news about the land
that he would give a novelty â a grand
teakettle- performance.
People through curiosity came from fay
and near to see the wonderful kettls.
which walked on tho tightrope, danced
jigs and drummed on his body to the de
light of everybody. The tinker grew rich,
and retired, the badger died, but the ket-
Lle can be seen to this day, preserved In
one of the temples, and the tiny counter
parts cf it are popular toys with the lit
tle brown men.
But the quaintest of all, and tha
most unique custom, is the presentation
of the "puppy cats," so named
by Mis3 Hyde because they resemble both
a puppy and a kitten. Not being able to
supply the right name, a compromise was
made and "puppy cat" It Is, with a dear
little, v/ise-looking face. These symbols
*re supposed to bring good luck, health
and great Intellect to the house, and
wherever a home is honored with tha
birth of a child friends throughout tha
province come with offerings of puppy
cats. Tiny ones an inch long are sent by
the children, but grave old philosophers
present the animal in its supposedly oris
iir.fi! sizeâ about a foot high.
Then there arÂ© the fete day toys and,
New Year's gifts. Long bamboo branches
with green and gold, much befeathered
little disks hanging therefromâ are car
ried about from house to house. Some
times the children put on dragon masks
over mischievous looking faces and so
about New Year's morning with these of
ferings. Into the house they prance, with
out knock or greeting, jump and caper
about, until a rlnâ about a twentieth of a
cent â Is offered them. Then they leave Â»
lucky wand and depart on their way to
the next residence.
On fete days men and women Join m
the most popular game of battledoor and
shuttlecock. Dignified business men with
their Ion? silk kimonos, little doll-faced
women, looking like gorgeous butterflies
in their violets and yellows, gather on
the lawn and enter into the game with
great enjoyment. As a forfeit for losing
is a smirch of black on the face. It is
quite amusing to see an unlucky player
with the criss-crosses marring his fea
tures. The battledoors used are elaborate
affairs, most of them being decorated
with symbols of patriotism, old-time war
heroes being most popular.-
While In Japan Miss Hyde mastered
the Japanese language, that is, enough
of it to carry on conversation, and this
was the cause of much satisfaction to
her little maid Toyo and the boy Uchl
yaraa. Toyo had much poetry In her little
Oriental heart, and when Miss Hyde of
fered-her a present just before she sailed
for home Toyo made a happy reply that
is too pretty to be lost. Going to a little
mirror that had been much used, sha
said a3 she salaamed, touching her
smooth little forehead to the floor, "It i3
tfii3 that I prefer, for in It has been mir
rored your face which I love and tha
faces of your friends whom 1 admire."
So declining the more costly present little
Toyo preferred the one that would bring
her the most tender recollections. If
that is net poetry, it is something far
more rare. One should be tempted to>
steal a maid capable of making such a
# reply. >
Uchiyama also gave proof of his devo
tion, for he insisted that the household
goods of Miss Hyde" be not sold. "Let
us store them," he requested. "But,"
said she. "it may be years before I re
turn." However, Cchiyama Insisted, say
ing that ten or twenty years might pass
and yet the goods would be safely await
ing her. So, the last vision of her beau
tiful little home ln>NIkko is peopled with
the faithful Toyo and Uchiyama packing
the mats, jars, stools and dishes which
are to repose peacefully in the "godown"
(cellar) until she shall return to claim
them. *

IN writing "Rosalynde's Lovers" Mau
rice Thompson gave full rein to that
kindly geniality so characteristic of
his poetical nature. This last work
of his is so absolutely unlike "Alice
Of Old Vincennes" that comparison in any
nay is impossible. "Rosalynde's Lovers"
is fiction pure and simple, and really a
charming little idyll lengthened out to the
proportions of a long short story. 4ts pur
pose is to interest and amuse, with noth
ing mere than a clever motif perfectly
developed.
To lay hare the plot of the story Is to
invite at once the criticism of improba
bility, but although the novelette reads
like a fairy tale, yet it is so well written
that the question of probability in plot
is ihe la?t point that would suggest itself
to a reader. "Resalynde's Lovers" has
the. same kind of clever surprise In the
endinsr that made "Marjorio Daw" and
"Prudence Palfrey" such favorites in
their day. For an idle hour of amuse
ment it is undoubtedly one of the beet
books of the season.
Fr^erick Breyton is of the handsome,
fond and wealthy that one "reads about
in books"â in fact, even there he is a rare
specimen! As ho comes to the little vil
lage of Hawford he tills more nearly the
role of an up-to-ilate fairy prince than of
any other character approved in fiction.
Like ail pood fairy princes, he travels in
itJgElto as far as his powers for doing
Â£'>od are concerned.
He is wheeling along the Hawford turn
pike at a lively gait as the story opens.
Mis rapid speed is for two reasons â first,
Ik cause a thunderstorm i? about to
break, and second, because he hopes to
overtake the delightful vision of a fair
ar^ graceful bicyclist that has suddenly
appeared to him at a bend of the road.
TiSr. Breyton's two reasons for speed bring
Oisastcr, for his careless riding throws
turn from his wheel. He has barely time
Lo pick himself and his bike up and rush
uiider the protection of a friendly bridge
;i.- the storm breaks.
This is a real old Hastern storm and the
thunder is so frightful that Mr. Breyton
is not surprised to find a pair of arms of
a terrified young woman thrown around
his neck as the result of an especially
l'jud crash.
Of course this Is the girl he lost from
r-'ght as he foil. She. too, had sought the
l-ridjre for a sheltering roof. And. of
Â«oursc. an acquaintance so romantically
1 "gun could hardly be allowed to end at
the bridge. Tin? fair maid is Rosalynde.
{>he makes her escape by a ruse imme
diately upon the cessation of weather hos
islities and Breyton finds nimself alone
v,iih a dainty kerchief, a red pocket-book
f.nd a tinpling sense of a beautiful young
v.^rnan's arms still around his neck.
With the material evidence of handker
rhief and book in his possession it is a
i-implc matter to trace the fair owner.
Breyton discovers her living with her
c:a:idfatherâ a candidate for Governor in
tlie coming election, with a poor chance
of cilice on account of his poverty. More
oves-, he finds that Rosalynde is engaged
Vm Alfred Beyle; a young fellow with a
.slight deformity of one leg, but still very
ha ndsomo.
Mr. Thompson nuts his hero above the
ordinary and into the class of fairy
princes at once by having him instruct
hi.-j bankers to secretly place at the
<rraiiUit;thcr'.Â« disposal 513,000 for his po-
Jitical campaign, and to the account o*
Hayie S'/t'jy for tho purpose of studying
crt in PstLs. Neither of the recipients
lias ii:i i<ica as to the donor of his
;,ift. but Jaior H&jie realizes ihat Brey
ton !s probably a.t ths bottom of his good
fortune.
llayle goes abroaO. but soon finds that
lie has no ger.ius and so merely remains
Jong enough to have his deformity taken
away by the clever knives of the Paris
Burgeons. Jn the meantime Breyton, by
an accident, has been thrown much in
Ihc company of Rosalyndc and has finally
told her of his love. She, however, is
true to her troth, and for a time ft cer
tainly appears that the fairy prince must
resign himself to a lovelorn old age.
It is then. that Mr. Thompson's higcnu-
Ity comes to the fore and saver, the day.
By a photograph and a girl cousin who
hears a most striking resemblance to
RosalymSc the author manages to give
I:i3 story a pretty turn of "live happy
ever afterward." We have not told
whether Breyton marries Rosalynde or
her cousinâ that is too good for any one
to tell but Mr. Thompson. He works out
tlie problem most satisfactorily and de
lightfully: all without a villain, without a
drop of blood spilled, and yet with every
page of intense interest
"Rosalynde's Lovers" is. of its kind, a
grem. It shows the master hand of po
etical prose and is as pretty a love story
as one could wist) to read. The dainty ex
pression of pure and refined sentiment
shown in the closing paragraph of the
story but indicates the character of the*
whole book:
"We can go no further. Marriage Is
not the end of Jove, but' it is the true end
of a love etory; and this is only a love
Klory."

William McKinley.
"The Life-Work of William McKinley,"
by E. T. Roe. is a splendid specimen of
buok-making by the enterprising publish
ing house of Laird & Lee, Chicago. !
WRITERS
OF BOOKS
The work is a carefully prepared and
ably written history of events of world-
wide importance, amplified by the com
ments and eulogistic tributes of eminent
men in America and Europe, and- embel
lished by a large number of most inter
esting and tastefully executed pctures of
high artistic merit. It has evidently been
the aim of the publishers to record the
life story of Mr. McKlnley in a simple
and direct manner that will appeal to all
the people with the force and eloquence
by which Mr. McKinley knew so well how
to endear himself to his countrymen.
Even a hurried glance through the book
will impress the reader with three strik
ing features: first, the amount of solid
historical Information distributed through
all the .chapters, making It a book of
reference; second, the large number of
new, Interesting incidents about the Presi
dent's ancestry and life; third, thÂ© careful
rounding out of each chapter in a way
that will surely leave a lasting impression.
The story of Mr. McKinley's life reads al
most like a romance, and through it all
runs that steadfastness of purpose, that
high moral courage and exalted patriot
ism, rarely equaled and never exceeded
in the history, of our public men. The
President/a own masterly description oÂ£
the Spanish War and the negotiations pre
ceding and following it. his splendid maer
nanimlty toward the conquered foe, his
farsighted policy in the newly acquired
possessions, and bis famous reciprocity
speech at Buffalo, are models of American
statesmanship, and form a most valuable
part of the book. Mr. McKinley's noble
character, tender heart and rare- wisdom
and the grand lessons of Tils life for
young and old are splendidly set forth.
The work is not only a mine of informa

A Book for Girls.
In her book. "To Girls," Heloise Ed
wina Hersey has much to say that is
practical and of the greatest value to the
young girl. The book is written in the
form of letters and in a confidential tone,
illustrated by introducing fictitious per
sonages\as examples or types. The au
thor writes directly to those she would
benefit and very wisely has made no effort
to produce a work for the edification of
grown-ups. Her book is for young girls
with their educations and social life be
fore them and she appeals directly to
them in a friendly and convincing way.
The author has this to say regarding the
purpose of her work and the method that
sho uses: :S-O.V
"What I had to say fell naturally into
the fornj of letters. That form kept my
audience clearly before me in the person
of a single girl that needed counsel in
some exigency of'life. large or small.
"Half unconsciously I found myself ad
dressing two different types of girls. The
first, whom I shall address as Htlen, Is
the girl who. for one reason and another,
has decided not to go to college, but who
is finding, or has found, an education in
the better sort of bourdlns-srhoo!. I have
known this kind of girl most intimately
for fifteen years. I think her problems
are grave ones and I have found her meet
ing th^m with a seriousness and a high
purpose for which she often fails to get
credit. The other â¢ letters are addressed
to Marcarct. tlie college Rirl. Of course
her position is not strictly a unique one,
and many questions which meet her mest
other c'.tIr as well.
"The subjects treated in the letters fall
into three divisions: the first of these is
thÂ«Â» educational one. thÂ» second the social
and the third concerns personal character.
These will constantly overlap each other;
but in the table of contents they have
been separated, as far as it was possible
to do so."
This book makes a very delightful holi
day present for thosr for whom it is in
tended and should well fulfill the author's
ambition to "give to some elrl a rav "f
light in perplexity or a thrill of courage
In weariness." (Published by Small, May
nard & Co., Boston.)
Three Holiday Books.
The Bowen-Merrill Company nf Indian
apolis have three very attractive hoiVs
on their holiday list. One of thfBe is thÂ°
"Farm Rhymes" of James Whltcojnl*
Rileyâ those verses that ring so true of'
the soil and the fresh, pure air of coun
try life. The twenty-seven verses that go
to make up the contents of the book have
been eharmir.erly illustrated with country
pictures by Will Vawter. and the publish
ers have printed th<? whole on fine, heavy
paper and given the book a pleasing
cover. The price is $1.
A book that will delight the hearts of
the younger folk is "The Story of Live
Dolls." by Josephine Scribner Gates, il
lustrated with sketches and v/ash draw
ings by Virginia Keep. Nothing delights
a child more than to play that her pet
doll is endowed with life. This is what
the author has done in "The Story of L've
Dolls." She relates the splendid happeu
fnes on a certain June morning, -when
all the dolls in the village of CloverdaU;
came alive. The publ'shors have done
thpir part well; for Iho type is eb large
an<i olrar that any child who ran read at
all will have no trouble. , The cover Is
quite stunning withered and blac-K" cloth
and its white picture and lettering. (Price
II.)
"Dream Children" is another holiday
book that will make a pleasing present
for children from 7 to 13 years. It is
<>riHed ?Â»nd illustrated by Elizabeth B.
Browncll. The author's selection of both
matter and pictures is admirable. The
illustrations are half-tone reproductions
of photographs especially posed for this
edition. The matter has been selected
from the best known writers of all times
and countries, with the care that every
selection has to do with. the general cap
tion of "Dream Children.". There is "The
Little Match Seller," by Hans Andersen;
"The Snow Image." by Nathaniel Haw
thorne; "Little Boy Blue," by .Eugene
Field; -The Story of Cosettc and Her
Doll," by Victor Hugo; ,"The Barefoot
Boy," by Johri G. Whittier; part of "A
Christmas Carol," by Charles Dickens,
and about twenty-five other bits along the
same lines and equally good. - This book
makes as pretty and useful a holiday gift
as one could desire. The price is 95 cents.
"Boys of the Fort."
"Boys of the Fort," by Captain. Ralph
Bonehill, is a complete story in itself, but
forms the fifth volume of a line of works
issued under the general title of "Flag of
Freedom Series." This tale relates to
the ins and out of military life at one of
our Western forts of to-day, showing
what both officers and privates are called
upon to do, and what troubles the Indians
and bad men of that locality are still in
the" habit of making. The field is one
about which little has been written, al
though abounding in interest.
The young captain is a fine specimen of
the wide-awake American army officer,
yet he is no more brave and dashing than
are thousands of others, officers and pri
vates, who serve under our flag of free
dom. He Is trained to do his duty, and
he simply does it, regardless of possible
consequence. (Published by the Mer
shon Company, New York. Price $125.)
The Master Key.
A book which will interest boys who
have a liking both for fairy tales and for
the study of electricity is "The Master
Key," by L-. Frank Baum. The young
hero Rob Joslyn, cares for nothing, so
much as, for making experiments with
electrical machines. One day while Rob
is in his workshop he discovers by acci
dent the way in which to summon to him
the demon, of electricity. When tha
demon appears Rob is told that he may
have for three weeks the power of choos
ing three times a week any gift he may
care for. Among the things given Rob
is a mechanical device enabling its pos
sessor to sail through the air In any di
rection. The other gifts are no less won
derful. With their aid Rob enters upon
a series of thrilling adventures which can
not fall to arouse the interest of . any
young reader. ,
Mr. Baum has pictured electrical appar
atus which at present can exist only la
a fairy story, but his description of it
will give boys an idea of the marvels yet
to be accomplished by a further study
into the possibilities of electricity. The
book Is well illustrated by colored pic
tures. (Published by the Bowen-Merrill
Company, Indianapolis.)
.A New Series.
"With Washington in the .West" is the
first volume of a "Colonial" series by Ed
ward Stratemeyer. While Washington's
Revolutionary career has been employed
in all possible ways by writers, his earlier
life has received scant attention, notwith
standing its possibilities, Mr. Strate
meyer has woven into an excellent story
something of Washington's youthful ex
perience as a surveyor, leading on to the
French and Indian Hostilities, and the al
ways thi tiling Braddoek's defeat. The
hero, David Morris, is the son of a Vir
ginia pioneer several years younger than
Washington, with whom he becomes well
acquainted; as well as with Captain Law
rence Washington, the elder â  brother of
the future President, and with Lord Fair
fax, the intimate fr.end of the Washing
ton family. The boys will be delighted
to follow Mr. Stratemeyer to a new histor
ical field, all the better for bejne; un
worked. There is plenty nf. military ex
perience and adventure, but tho story is
not till of war. Pictures of pioneer life are
given: scenes with friendly Indians enÂ«l
old-time games. (Published by Lee &
Shepard, Boston. Price. $1 25.)

The Illustration ahovc is one cf a great number of fine half-tone reproduc
tions that form no small part of a valuable book by IT. W. Huntlngton â"The.
LIiow Dos:." Mr. Huntingtcn is the late President of the National Greyhound
Club of America, and is also the author ot "My Dcg and I.". He ha3 his sub
ject at his linger tips and this last volume will be highly'appreciated by all lov
ers of the blue blood canine. The book 13 devoted to describing the cardinal vir
tues and objectionable features of all ths breeds of dogs from the.show ring
standpoint, with the. mode of.treatment of the dog both in health and sickness.
It is of the greatest help to the fanc.er. Firstâby the aid of a fine half-tone
illustration from life.of a typical dog, he in shown the proper conformation of
the breed concerning which he desires enlightenment. Here is an optical illustra
tion which is most potent in enabling: him to form a proper idea of the breed un
der consideration. Nextâhe is given the standard as adopted by the Specialty
'Club, which is supposed to minutely and scientifically describe in comprehensive
language what the perfect specimen shuld be. . Then the author finishes with
what he terms "Comments," which is little else, than a description of what Is to
be avoided in the conformation of the animal, and the filling up of omissions in
the standard. The entire combination of "Do's" and "Dont's" should therefore
enable the fancier to avoid all the pitfalls that beset his path In passing judg
ment on a dog. Consequently there is nothing left for the reader to do but to thor

Mexican chillis snuggling close

their red enameled forms and green
topped crowr.s scintillating -witli bright
lights, Â«s thpy are swung by the winds
and kissed by the sun.
During the months of fall, a portion of
the Southern California world is envel
oped In robes of crimson, and the land
scape for ma-ny* miles is panoramic with
the unique display.
At this season nnd in the localities
tvhere peppers arc prepared for commerce,
great walls of brilliant orimponâ the ra< ks
en >hich the peppers dry â spring spon
taneously from tbe crimson-carpeted
earth like myriads of frolirksorae flames.
There are peppers every v.herr. line af
ter line of fire-colored tendrils, until the
buildings, the fences, me pccple and the
very air Been to be festeone'1. wreathed
and enlivened with radiant coils. Here
could be obtained a supply of great jump
ing ropes sufficient for use in a city of
Goliahs, and what a marvelous spectacle
it â would be to see all the gay wreatlxs in
motion.
Peppers were introduced into Southern
Oaliiornia by the- early Spanish settlers,
who considered them an indispensable ele
ment of food, and since their initiation in
the California soil they nave flanced along
the pathway of industry and entered a
sphere of considerable prominence. They
are a necessary and conspicuous ingredi
ent in the Spanish cuisine, and enchilladas,
chilli con carne. tamales and various
other Spanish delicacies -would be flat and
Insipid without the warm flavor of the
Mexican chilli.
Peppers are extensively used in the
preparation cf canned goods, and also in
the making of tamales, which are a most
popular article of food with all classes.
When tamales are properly made they
are delicious, the method of preparation
being to boil a quantity of corn in lye,
and after it is hulled grind it in a mortar
unUl It becomes as fine as powder. Into
thii meal is poured hot butter, and the
two Ingredients are stirred together until
light and frothy. This mixture Is then
laid on corn husks in alternate layers
with a filling composed of hashed chicken,
fried onions, chopped celery, olives and
an abundance of the spicy chilli. The
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE CELLAR
QUICKLIME, borax, charcoal, dry
copperas and plaster are the things
to make and keep a cellar sweet
and fresh. Move out all things
movable, sweep, take up dust, open bins
and closets and set doors and windows
wide. Then in every bin or inclosed space
set an earthen vessel, dish or bowl with
several lumps of quicklime in it. Strew
prains of dry copperas all over the lime,
then slack it. but do net wet it. yet be
fiure the slacking is thorough. Steam
from the lime, rising up and out will take
away all bad air and III odors.
Leave the cellar open and empty for
two hours, then scatter dry powdered
boijx all around. In corners and along the
waEs. and wherever there Is a place
trhere it will not be in the way hang a
piece of net, such as fish net, with some
lumps of fresh charcoal tied Inside. I/eave
the borax until next "cleaning tlmÂ©. Take
husks are taen tied at both ends and the
tamales healed either by steaming or be
ing place ik an oven. The chillis are
prepared forbse by being cut open length
wise and solked in boiling water. The
inner lengthrise strings are then removed
and thrown iway, and the skin thorough
ly scraped ot all edible material, which,
after being aralned through a fine sieve
to remove thl seeds, is ready for its work
of spicy embellishment.
The pepperj principally cultivated in
Southern California are of the species
capsicum anmmm,' and aa they grow
luxuriantly aid bear profusely, their
planting is considered a profitable ' under
taking. The plants grow low in the fields,
something lika potato vines. The leaves
are narrow, dirk green and mostly gla
brous, and splout from many forking
stems. The white flowers bloom on soli
tary or cymoselclustered pedicels.
In the spring, after the -winter rains
have ceased, thi pepper seeds are planted
In drills. In theihand-worked gardens the
plants are placed about one foot apart,
but in the fields where horse cultivators
are used the distance should be much
gTeater, the rowa being at least three feet
apart. â¢ 1
The plants require no irrigation, culti
vation being sufteient ' to supnly their
needs. The cost o\ planting peppers aver
ages $1 50 per acre;, and at the end of the
season when the harvest is complete, the
produce from one acre amounts to about
200 strings, which usually sell at 75 cents
a string, bringing the producer the neat
little sum of $225 per acre.
In the most favorable localities where
there Is no "frost. thÂ« plants will produce,
for two years, but ttey are very suscep
tible to chill and invariable wither under
the caresses of the vfenerable Jack. Frost,
and in case he makes a visitation, re
planting is necessary every year.
The industry is carried on extensively
about Santa Ana and Anaheim, and there
are many large fields in Ventura County
and otner counties of Southern Califor
nia. Among those* engaged In the indus
try, Spanish and Chinese are the great
est producers, and a tranquil, pig-tailed
Celestial with his wagon load of bright
peppers Is not an infrequent sight on the
country roads. Every Spanish household
has its own small patch of peppers, the
harvest from which decorates their
homes and warms their food.
The peppers ripen in September, and
hang like crimson cornucopias among the
dark foliage of their mother plant. At
this time when Nature has completed her
artist's work, and when, after her help,
the peppers have attained the proper
tinge of crimson, the pickers, an assort
ment of men of various nationalities, in
which Spanish and Chinese predominate,
enter the field laden with tubs, boxes or
baskets as convenience dictates, and the
harvest begins. One conscientious worker
will pick about 200 pounds of peppers a
day.
When the various receptacles begin to
the charcoal bags down every week,
empty them, heat the charcoal very hot,
return to the bags and replace them.
Charcoal has a marvelous power to ab
sorb all sorts ot bad smells. The power
is strictly proportioned to its freshness,
which the heating restores. â¢ â¢
Make cheesecloth pads of plaster mixed
with powdered slaked lime and hang them
against the walls that are likeliest to be
damp. Lime and plaster are so thirsty
they take all the spare water to them
selves, thereby preventing must and mold.
A good way to make the pads is to stitch
or run inch tucks in a length of cheese
cloth or coarse lawn, then slip a funnel
epout Into the open end of the tuck and
pour in the plaster and lime. Make the
tucks an inch apart, and fill them evenly.
Powdered charcoal may be lixed with the
lime and plaster for pads which are to

brim over with their gay contents they
â¢are carried to the outskirts of the field,
where wagons are waiting. Into the
wagons the peppers are tossed in blush
ing confusion and carted from their
home environments to a place -where
stringing is being done. Here they are
dumped pellmell all over the ground,
where they form a mass of symphonic
brilliancy, in which the dark scarlet
shadows of the half hid mingle with the
sun-tipped crimson glints of the more

Spanish women flock in to help with
the stringingâ captivating senoritas with
witching eyes and coal black hair. Then
there are massive, plump senoras, who
have forgotten the art of witchery
and romance, Â« and who, as they work,
think and talk of new methods of mak
ing enchilladas, tamales and other edible
concoctions. They push the peppers
aside, as a hen makes her nest, and
squat flat on the ground, where, in the
midst of the glowing piles, they chatter
and work from morning till night. .
In their laps they hold a long narrow
board, in one end of which is arranged
a small block that contains a groove for
supporting the long needle used for
HOW YOU SHOULD COOK A TURKEY
MINETY-NINE women out of every
one hundred, ninety-nine cooks out
of every one hundred, will bake a
turkey with the back to the pan,"
said a New Orleans man who keeps :n
touch wth the kitchen, "and this '3
a mistake. I said ninety-nine out
of every one hundred. Rather should*
I. have said that the mistake is "almost
universally made. But few cooks ever
think of cooking the turkey any other
way. There seems to be a demand for
i well-browned turRey breast. But in
browning 7 the breast they sacrifice tho
sweetness of this part of the fowl. The
best way to prepare a turkey is to bake
it* with the breast down. I learned th'3
lesson from* Mme.- Begue, whose place
down in the Old Quarter near the French
market has become famed all over, tha
country. - She never thinks of baking a
turkey with the breast up- .The breast 13
turned to the bottom of the pan,. and In-
stringing the peppers. The needle, -whlei*
is fifteen inches in length, is placed up
right in this grove, and the peppers,
after being pierced through the stem, are
packed closely on the needle in, the
form of a star, so that the air and sun
can reach them more effectively. When
the needle is full it is raised from thÂ©
groove and the peppers pushed down on
the string, the uniform length of each
string being ten feet. The women re-
ceive from three to five cents a string:
for their work.
The strings when crowded full of thÂ«
crimson burden are hung up to dry, and
when one knows that the crop of pep
pers in Southern California this year has
run up into tens of thousands of strings,
and that all these 'strings are festooned
over buildings, fences and racks in the
localities where they are raised, one can
use his imagination and realize tha
festive aspect of the country.
When the strings are first placed in
the sun they average twenty-five pounds
in weight, but after they are thoroughly
dry and suitable for shipping they have
dwindled to a weight of live pounds.
Great â  quantities of peppers are used
on shipboard and so great is becoming
the demand fcr peppers by all classes
That they are extensively-- freighted
throughout the country.
stead of being dry and tasteless when it
is served it is richly flavored and as sweet
and juicy as one would care to have it.
You see. all the. fine flavoring of the tur
key, the juices of the dressing, and all
the daintier touches flow down toward
the breast of the fowl, and when the
white meat is served you get the full
benefit of every flavor added during tha
processes of preparing and baking tha
turkey, in addition to the distinctivo
taste of the fowl itself. Inconvenient and
awkward? Not at all. It is just aa easy
to cook a turkey in this way as in any
other way, and the result is infinitely
more satisfactory. It is no trouble to ar
range the fovfl in tho pan; if you desira
to place the fowl on the table before
carving it you will find that It will look
quite as well as it would if baked in the
usual â¢ way. and certainly it will tasta
much better than it would if you baked
tho breast until it was dry and flavor*
less."â New Orleans Times-Democrat.14
THE STORY
OF
SPEDLINS
GHOST
LET me out: Let me oxrt!" comes
the cry of a soul in torment over
the Annan waters. For nigh on to
two centuries has that beseeching
prayer come sighing with- the
winds and the hail and the sleet.
The cry is the echo of a poor unfortun
ate, done to death, left to starve in a
cold, dismal dungeon, alone with his God'
and his conscience, the bright sunshine
Ehut out forever.
Forgotten by tlie "world above him, he
makes agonizing efforts to tear down the
vails that hold him captive.
Starvation is gnawing at his vitals, he
einks his teeth in his tender flesh and his
blood-dripping lips let forth a final
scream, "Let me out! Let me out!"
â¢ * '". â¢ ," '
Far down the valley came th3 sound of
galloping horsemen, presently cculd be
heard the shouts of the drovers, urging
cattle ahead of them, then the rattle of
eteel and the clinking of spurs and ths
laughter of men whose work is accom
plished.
Around the bend came a goodly hort of
men at a hand gallop, returning from a
successful border raid, and home for
Christmas.
Xo ordinary raid had this been, how
ever, for Sir Peter, the red headed, the
dread of the south, had led it in person,
and where Sir Peter went retainers must
follow.
They had swept across the border in
the dead of night and surprised an old
enemy, John Nasoby of Riven; and
caught his guards napping.
It had been a bloody skirmish, and
many men en both sides had fallen.
Naseby had fled to the sea with a few
cf his remaining followers, guarding zeal
ously h:s only daughter, but many had
been taken prisoners and Latham of Lee
Bixtocs the number.
No wonder Sir Peter laughed long anl
Icud as he galloped along side by side
with his old crony. Sir Michael of
.Auehen; fcr was he not on his good
green turf again, had not the haul been a
rich cne and had he not in his clutches
hfs arch enemy and successful rival.
Hugh Latham of Lee.
Ay: indeed it had been worth the fight;
twenty odd good men at arms as prison- â¢
crs, lo be hanged or broken Into his own
band of hardened .marauders, fifty head
of calUe and as many horses andâSr.se
by"s pride.
Round the bend of the Annan they
â wheel up to the castle gates, the draw- f
bridge is let down, they clatter across the
moat, they are home and safe.
Into the vast hall march the conquerors
end in after them surge the retainers and
men at arms.
It has been a time of hard riding, hard
fighting, now for the cup and feasting
and well earned rest.
Health after health is drunk, the rafters
ring with joyous shouts, smoking dishes
appear and load down the tables, sheep
are roasted whole, ail to celebrate the
most successful raid in years, and the
jolly Christmas time as well.
The common prisoners, bound hand and
foot, are bedded for the night in the vast
"salle" above the banquet hall, but poor
Latham, of Lee rests his weary bones as
best t>A can. some straw for his pallet,
bread and wine for his stomach, in the
dungeons beneath the keep.
Sir Peter and his good friend * Sir
Michael talked long into the night, sit
ting, legs stretched out, before the bl? loa
fire, and Naseby'B, name and" Latham's
name were most on the tongues of both.
Should it b^ death or ransom? Quoth
Sir Peter. "Could I but have got the
wench I would have hanged young Hugh
to the highest limb ere crow of cock to
morrow."
"Hang'hlm anyhow." growled the Bar
onet, and they went to bed.
But betimes next morning there came a
messenger from Edinburgh, whose hearing
would admit. of no delay. The Council
called.
In an hour the pair, with fifty men be
hind them, were riding like devils toward
the capital. i-l-'-Vs;
Prisoners and raids had no place in their
thoughts now, and the jollity of the Tulo
tide was well forgotten. '
That night strange sounds were heard,
and the next and the next, faint cries
which grew gradually fainter and fainter,
then died cut forever.
One old servant, David Rogers, who had
served the son and the father before him.
alone bethought himself of the youns
laird, lying in the dungcen below and
trembled when he remembered that the
keys hung at Sir Peter's belt.
Xo man could be spared from guarding
the prisoners to ride to Edinburgh, and
there was no way of getting through three
feet cf solid masonry and. dreadful
thcrght. perhaps Sir Peter knew he had
the keye.
But evidently Sir Peter had forgotten all
about Hugh Lee till he got to the capital,
for one morning a horseman was seen to
draw up at the gates, his horse near dead
and he himself little better off.
He had ridden day and night, sparing
neither body nor horseflesh, to bring the
keys of the fiungecn. The key3 were de
livered, they rushed down, they turned
the heavy locks and drew back the poi -
derous bolts.
There a ghastly sight met their eyes.
By the light of the torches they saw the
wretched young man 'lying, his eyes
glassy, a bloody foam at his mouth, his
right sleeve rolled up and th* flesh of his
arm eaten away.
It is Faid that when Sir Peter heard ol
this terrible tragedy his red hair stood or
end and his face took on a frozen look.
He gave up hunting and hawking, raiding
and drinking, chut himself up in the east
wing and would see no one or have nc
one near him but old David, his old re
tainer.
To his sons he Intrusted the guarding
and management of the vast estates,
while he sat alpne with his thoughts and
his crimes.
Even the approach of the holidays
brought no cheer to the old man, but
rather dread, and Christmas came with
never a word of the old-time jollity.
That right curdling yells were heard in
the east wing, and cries as of a lost soul.
Men were quickly to the door where the
recluse slept, the sons leading the van and
old David trembling and tottering behind,
them. ,^.y.-"'l â '
The door was burst In and by, the light
of the dying logs could be seen on the bed
the gaunt body of Sir Peter, twisted into
an almost unrecognizable shape, and a
bloody hole in his throat and the marks
of teeth that belonged to no animal.
Time went on, the east wing was closed
and the sons traveled abroad, but in the
long winter nights moans and cries were
repeatedly heard.
A serving man swore by the rood that

rowing over the Annan on jne Christmas
night from a neighboring farm he had
seen a tall figure running tlong the bank
wringing its hands and crying "Let me
out!" "Let me out:" Spedins castle thus
came to be haunted, anC as the years
rolled by was deserted aad allowed â  to
crumble and decay, leaving only one mas
sive wing, the strongest of all, under
which lay the dungeons.
And in the course of events a new ancl
modern structure was seen to go up on
the other side of the river and furniture
came from London town 'and presently a.
young Sir y William brought his blushing
bride to the "Hall."
With the coming of the holidays* rumor
had it, the same moans and sighs were
heard and the patheUc cry of "Let me
out." "Let me out."
Then' the miller coming up the long drive
saw that same tall figure moving amor.jr
the beeches, crying and uttering mourn
ful sounds. He had lashed up his horse
and arrived in the kitchen whiter than
his flour, and had breathlessly related his
story. It had taken many long draughts
of the butler's best before he could be
prevailed on to make the home journey,
and how he did get home he never l:r.cw.
Again, a servant maid stealing out to
meet her lover sraw in the moonlight the
form of a young nun, his face pale,
bloody foam on his mouth, standing on
one of .the long grass mounds.
Screaming, her apron thrown over her
head, she ran back to the pantry, there
to fall in a deep swoon, which lasted so
long it seemed like death.
Sir William, hearing of these two en
counters and being himself of a nervous
temperament, took counsel of his friends.
Some suggested one thing, some another,
but one sage bade him hie to Edinburgh,
there to buy -and bring Lack the blessed
book. ,
Acting on this advice presently was to
be seen a large handsome Bible inclosed
In a beautifully carved oaken case lying
on a massive table In the center of the
large reception-room.
It is a matter of record that the soul
of the murdered Latham of Lee rested
In peace for. many years after that and
It was not till 1S20 that anything of a
serious nature occurred in connection with
the tragedy of so many years before.
The hall was once more in tbe decorat
or's hands and more new furniture came
from London and amidst great rejoicings
and flying of flags and playing of bands
another young Sir William brought hia
bride home. . -
A handsomer couple never faced their
tenantry and for many months their time
wa3 devoted to the regfcprlng of farms,
tiding over tenants and a, devotion to the
property arid the people thereon generally.
And all might have been well for all
time had not the young laird, when he
took out the great book from its oaken,
rase, there to write the name and date
of his first born, discovered that the bind
ing was sadly in need of repair.
The idea once in his head nothing would
do but the book must be taken on the
coming holiday shopping trip to Edinburgh
to be rebound.
His wife's entreaties were of no avail.
"The whole thing was superstitious non
sense, anyway,"" he argued. "He only
revered the book because it was Holy Writ
and paid no attention to the fears of the
neighborhood; nevertheless, as her lady
ship desired it. the book should be taken
in its case and brought back In its case
and then perhaps she would be satisfied."
"But, Sir William," she pleaded, "It Is
not that so much, It is not of ourselves
I am thinking, but of the poor good super
stitious souls that must remain here un
der our roof while the Bible Is away. If
they learn of it they will all leave and
will never be induced to return."
But the laird was obdurate and the next
day, in their large comfortable traveling
carriage, drawn by four horses and fol
lowed by two trusty servants on horse
back, they set forth with their precious
burden for Edinburgh.
They reached the capital in safety and
Sir William good naturedly laughed at the
fears his spouse had entertained.
The binding completed and shopping
finished they started for home.
And now came a chapter of accidents.
They had not traveled thirty miles before
one of the hind wheels came off and they
were forced to delay for repairs. The jar
had been a considerable one and her lady
ship's nerves were greatly upset thereby
âmoreover they found to their disgu.st
! that they must spend Christma3 day on
the road.
The husband consoled â  her in every
way possible and that night they rested
at the Dougla3 Arms, where accommoda
tions had already been prepared for them.
They dined iri their own apartmentsâ a
rather sorry Christmas dinnerâ and her
ladyship retired early to bed.
Sir William went downstairs to chat
with the landlord and drink a negus or
two, as was his custom.
J The common room was empty and the
landlord informed him tnere were but twf
other guests in the house, a doctor of mid
dle age, on his way to Engjand, and a be
lated young squire of the neighborhood,
on hi3 way to his father's house for the
holidays; his horse had dropped a shoe
and he had preferred to wait till morning
before undertaking the ten miles still be
fore him. % fy-
At 11 o'clock the landlord closed tip.
barred and locked the back and front
doors, and bidding Sir William a pleasant
repose retired to his own quarters.
Sir William harl just got into his first
sound sleep when something woka him
with a start. He sat up in bed, and thi3
time the undeniable report of a pistol shot
came to his ears.
Ee jumped out of bed. hastily put on his
dressing gown, bade, her ladyship stay
fiui-nly where she was, and went out lntÂ«Â»
the hallway.
His candle threw shadows on the wall
as he groped his way along the passage.
At the top of the stairs he discovered thÂ«
irnkeepcr, with a candle in cne hand and
an old blunderbuss in the ether.
"What has happened?" asked Sir WU
"God knows, sir, but the sound came
from the young squire's room."
The Jaird went quickly back for hts
small arms and they went together to the
bedchamber, whence the sound of shots
had come. J
The door was locked. One push frornA
Sir William's powerful shoulders and
they were in the room. The window was
open and they shaded their candles with
their hands from the night air.
The innkeeper shut the window. Then
they looked around them.
The table was overturned, chairs were
upset and the disorder of the room
showed there had been a desperate strug
gle.
In one corner nearest the bed ,lay a
white object. It was the young â¢ squire,
shot through the lungs.
Sir William tenderly lifted him up till
he rested on his knee.
"Run for the doctor and bring some
brandy," said the laird.
The innkeeper shuffled out of the room.
The boy, he was but nineteen, opened his
eyes, looked up at Sir William's pale face,
smiled and said "No good."
He was dead befqre the doctor, rub
bing his eyes, half awake, got to his
side.
The country was scoured for miles. The
murderer, however, was never discov
ered. How he had gained an entry to the
inn remained always a mystery. His
egress had been, of course, by the opeftV
window, whence he had dropped some ten
feet to the ground.
Sir William, himself a magistrate, took
full charge of the affair and accompanied
the remains to the house of the sorrow
ing parents, to 'whom he related the cir
cumstances as far as he was able.
Then the laird and his wife continued
their Journey with sad faces and bowed
heads.
Her ladyship whispered once in the ear
of her spouse. "Sir William, if we ever
get home with the book. In safety, go
down on your knees and thank the Al
mighty."
And Sir William, nodding his head,
promised he would.
On arriving at the hall it was with a
sigh of relief that they discovered that
from the stately butler to the boy below
stairs, there were only smiles and greet
ings and welcome home.
That night her ladyship sighed and said,
"Thank God, everything is all rigli:
here."
"Spedlins was busy elsewhere," re
plied Sir William, a3 he blew out the
Ilrht
ngnt.
For sixty years the Bible lay In its
caken case undisturbed and there v|s
peace and quiet In the land.
There came a time, however, when an
other laird sat in the home, of his fathers
and found It too small for himself and
his family.
At first he was for building a new
house, but eventually decided that the
foundations should stay, but that there
should be an extension of wlng3 and an
other stcry put on.
So the family departed to the manor
house and the Bible in its case went with
them.
The repairs commenced and the 'tirst
big brown stone was loosened at the ea?t
corner.
- David Rogers, the eldest mason on the
estate, superintended the operations.
How it happened, no one can or will
tell, but the big stone loosened before
any one realized it, tottered, then fell,
crushing poor old Rogers Into a mass of
nothing.
Accident followed accident and the men
refused to work. English masons were
sent fcr and the work went slowly on.
No sooner was the extra story up than
the house began to sink and the wings
and other improvements were given up. ,
To-day the Bible is back in Us plcjf-.

On Christmas eve. 18Gâ ." Chester Haw
ley graduate of. Yale, lawyer and shrewd
Fpeculator in mining stocks, sat down to
a mild carousal with three close friends
in what was then San Francisco's prime
restaurant There had been a sudden turn
in the market and all four had fared well
tor the deal of fortune, Hawley cleared
some twenty odd thousand dollars by the
turn the others amounts ln the same
neighborhood. They .were all unmarried,
fond of work during working hours and
iu^t aÂ« fond of pleasure when work was
tiuc aside They owned their own horses,
and whenever the occasion presented it
self they would drive out to Jim Dickey's
nid Oc.an House, along what is now
known as the Ingleside road, for a break
fast, a lunch or a dinner. These four
men made money easily and they spent
it with a free hand. Jim Dickey latterly
known as colonel, and perhaps the mott
â¢famous of all California roadhouse pro
prietors, often raid in reminiscent mood
that Ches Hawley. Frank Edwards. Jim
Boyd and Fred McAllister were the four
princes of the West, and that Hawley was
the fit leader of this unparalleled quartet.

Jim Boyd, cut and out stock gambler,
was a clcse second. Whether at poker,
âº ct faro or In business these men would
stake all their ready available funds if
the dare was properly and genuinely
given.
During the few weeks preceding this

the next. Business absorbed their atten

The strain told on all and when they met
Christmas Eve for temporary forgetful
ness of financial cares they were ready to
counteract all the inroads that the stren
uous life had made on them by a- wild
hurrah celebration. After a toast to
"Her" Boyd silenced his friend with a
quick, jerky movement of his hand and
said:
"Gentlemen, we have seen the best of

ley, I have kept account of our mutual

THE woman hesitated as she neared
the entrance of the great depart
ment store. Santa Claus was hold-
Ing his court within and the busy
throng jostled each other good
naturedly as they struggled through the
crowded doorway. Richly gowned and of
refined appearance, the woman's natural
beauty was marred by a bored, unhappy
look.
"Please, ma'am, will you take us in to
see Santa Claus?"
The wistful question, in a pleading,
childish voice, and a timid touch on the
arm, .drew the woman's attention to a
ragged feminine creature at her side.
With a flush of annoyance she was turn-
Ing away without a word when some im
pulse, possibly stirred by the srentle
Christmas spirit that once a year steals
Into every heart worthy of the Master's
sacrifice, prompted her to turn and look
again into the pinched and haggard little
face. ' *
Silently she gazed at the little, old child
âaged with poverty land grinding cares
beyond her years and strength. A small,
square shawl was pinned across her
shoulders and a shapeless arrangement of
straw and faded ribbon did duty for a
hat. Her mouth drooped at the corners.
Clinging to her hand was a tiny tot as
ragged and as pitiful looking as herself.
The hard lines of the woman's face re
laxed and she asked: ' *
"â¢Can't you go in alone?"
."No, ma'am." the answer came with
breathless ha3te, "they won't let children
go ln unless they are taken in."
"Why doesn't your mother take you
in?"
The childish lips quivered and the

AU assented that the terms offered were
fair. With raised glass Hawley pledGed
acquiescence. "Cnn you KCt tho boys to

violator of quite a few commandments,
looked horrified at the suggestion. "Why,
it's Christmas," he shouted. "Surely nut

Hawley had the same reverential feel
ing toward the holiness of the day so the
prospect of the prizefight was deferred.
The wine fizzed into the glasses and
mounted to the brains of the four diners.
Try as they would they could not get
away from the fight. Discussion followed
and the end of it all was that an agree-

With newly awakened sympathy and
tact the woman changed the conversa

"How old are you?" she asked ln a
softened voice.
â¢ The child, small, aged and thin, an
swered proudly:
"I'm 10 years old."
The woman caught her breath.
"The little boy," she went on, "is he
your grandson?"
There was a whimsical light in her
beautiful eyes as she asked the question.
"No, ma'am," gravely answered the
child. "He's my. little brother. He's 3
years old. His name is Bobby." ,
"And your name?"
"Martha."
The woman gazed a moment longer at
ths two pitiful little figures. With the
divining sense of children, they already
knew that their victory was won.

"But Bobbyâ he's little, you know, 'and â

Santa Claus handed Bobby the sweets,

"Please ask them," she sweetly said,

He understood, and put the question

Her little crushed soul was already ex

that he could demonstrate to all satis
faction his superiority over Seannel. whom,
he had seen In several hard tights. Tho
two lighters appeared in ihe big barroom
almost simultaneously. Scannel bowed
pleasantly to his antagonist and walked
over to the fireplace, poked one foot o\-Â«Â»r
the burning log and then the other and
joked good naturedly with the very re-
Fpeclful barkeeper. The new man hung
shyly to the end of the bar. Within five
minutes after the appearance of the
principals the barroom was filled with
stamping, hand-clapping men. The fire
and the bar divided immediate honors.
Not many of the men who saw that
fight are In San Francisco to-dayâ or for
the matter of that on this stdw of the
world â but those who were eye â witnesses
have never forgotten the battle between
Dick Scannel and Hawley's man. Both
young men. trained to a nicety, active,
alert, agile, about 133 pounds in weight,
fought until one was packed off the field
senseless and the other supported by his
seconds. The unknown overcame his
nervousness after he knocked down tha
redoubtable Scannel for the thin! time.
The champion was nonplused. Feint or
rush meant nothing to his opponent. All
were met with a perfect mastery of skill.
The impact of his knuckles had left cuts
and gashes ln Scanner* face and the
only visible sign of battle on his own
face was a discolored patch underneath
the eye. There seamed no hope for Scan
nel, and the time was placed on his en
durance. Congratulations were, shouted
at Ilawlcy across the Improvised ring
and even Jim Boyd whispered to the
beaten man's seconds to throw up tha
spontre. Scannel became almost frantio
at this and with a touch of melodramatic!
fury swore that he would quit only when
strength and senses left him.
The tide of battle had been steadily
sweeping one way. The new man's con
fidence in himself grew stronger and
stronger. Scanners rage was becoming
more and more impotent. Then something
happened as it does sometimes even In
legitimate prizefights. There was & sud
den rush. In a mad. wild swing Scanner*
right fist fell full tilt upon that most vul
nerable of all spots, the chin. No one wan
more surprised than Scannel. It was a
fierce blow and Hawley's man measured
his length upon the ground. He tried to
pull himself together, but his locomotive
power had left him. He was limp, pow
erless. The seconds worked hard on him.
during the minute that followed, but It
was of no avail. Hawley's man could not
toe the scratch and Scannel had won tha
fight.
Like a thunder clap out of a clear sky.
the sudden change and turn of affairs
left the spectators speechless and dura
founded. Back to the house they all
walked, wondering over the result, all
except Hawley, who waited fcÂ«hlnd to pat
his game young pugilist on the shoulder.
The seconds packed him to his* room.
Hawley administering solace and comfort.
On his cot they laid him preparatory to
a rub-aown. Hawley did not feel the
loss of the $1000 on the bet half as keenly
as the sorrow of this hardy boy. who
fought a winning fight till the very last
moment. As he left him Hawley put a
$100 bill into his hand, saying: "Here, my
boy, take this, and If you need another
you know where to find me."
Then there was bustle and flurry. It
seemed as If every one present nad to
reach town at the same time. Horses wera
hitched tn one, two and three fashion,
men called out to one another as they
drove off, betsÂ»were paid, bottles opened
and a general shout filled the air. The
prize-flghters trailed behind in their own
rig. â  Scannel won the purse, but he was
a sorry sight indeed. The new man's face
âsave for that black patchâ was un
scathed, but the deepest of sorrow sat ln
his heart.
Hawley. true to his promise to tha
pugilist, never divulged his name. The
discovery was to depend upon the result
of the tight. He had made up his mirvl
that if victorious he would . follow the
fortunes of pugilism. If defeated he
would seek luck in some other way and
ln another land.
Chester Hawley's Uew Year's eve was
a merry one in a quiet way. Dinner waÂ»
served in his own rooms and the table
was set pour deux. Hawley had mada

According to her own story, she

IT IS true that I am a student of
psychology. In fact I am a wor
eh'.per at the shrine of occultism, un
tiring in my efforts to understand
the unknown forces of the universe.
My trip to Egypt last year was partly for
my health and partly for purposes of in
vestigation, to wrest, if I could, the
secrets of so-called magic from those
sphinx-like custodians of ancient mystic
lore, the high priests of Egypt.
That I was partially successful in my
attempt is due, perhaps, to the fact
that a drop of Egyptian blood flows
in my vein?, that in a sense I
am one of them. This couplet
with the fa<?t that I am paid to possess
to a high degree a psychic power admitted
' me to the presence of Egypt's famous
seers, who initiated me, If not to the inner
sanctuary, at least to one of the inner
circles. I resent the terms magic and
mysticism. The phenomena called by
these names are neither the one nor the
other, but simply the result of scientific
research and the natural forces of nature
applied. Clairvoyance, clairaudiance.
thought telegraphy or telepathy and vari
ous phases of mediumship are only ordi
narv, and the primal result of scientific
Investigation. The more intricate phases
of psychological lore in which I am at
present much interested is that of de
materialization, or of the power to pro
ject the ego or astral from a material
body, to fly through space as it were, to
come and go. using: the material self or
body simply as a domicile or temporary
home for the ego.
The psychical sciences have in this
last decade made most wonderful strides,
and the benefits which humanity owes to
the discoveries tnus made are too many
to estimate. This domain of advanced
psychology has rendered incalculable
service In the treatment of neurotic affec
tions and cf many very pitiable mental
distresses. Psychology approaches more
closely to the problems of philosophy and
of religion than any other science, and it.
Is pre-eminently more satisfying in. re
gard to the great problem of the origin
and destiny of man than any known re
search. The facts made manifest' by
scientific investigation have seized upon
the attention of' most of the profound
thinkers of the age. i>V"
Psychical phenomena are no longer a
question of self deception, of hallucina
tion. It is not hysterical patients we have
to deal with, but people, of mind, and
those who would deny the reality of such
phenomena must confront a multitude of
our most capable men of science, who are
individuals unhampered by creeds and
prejudice, men who, for the enlightenment
of the world, as well as for their own
satisfaction, are willing to sacrifice time
and money for purposes of strict investi
gation â for exposing frauds and discover
ing truth. This can be accomplished only
when we come into the knowledge of
these unseen, and now unused forces- of
nature, which are manifestly intended for
our use, but of which we are to-day al
most entirely ignorant. â¢
Psychometry is perhaps the most uni
versal development of this natural force
or power of intuition. We are all con
stantly leaving the impress of our char
acter upon everything we touch. A mag
netism, a psychic force, constantly ex
udes from us, the very air around us is
impregnated and a sensitive or developed
psychic or advanced student of psychol
ogy can unerringly tell before seeing the
person his or her characteristics and
whether his. or her life be a good one or
a bad one. The magnetism our foot leaves
upon the ground gives the clew to our
dog who follows us, as more tangible
characteristics of our life allow our
friends to read us. We are surrounded
by a sensitive vapor, and when we meet
each other as strangers we unconsciously
and silently take estimates and impres
sions which develop into either mutual
congeniality or antagonism. As physical
facts are seen by the eye -.of the material
body, so 'can the eye of the soul look close
into nature's temple and" there read that
which to the physical is unseen.
Another unrecognized power, and one
which is, except in the circle of science,
.' almost unknown, is the force of hypno
tism, yet by its aid there remains little
in the realm of psychology that cannot
be accomplished. It is a well known fact
that hypnotic suggestion is a force more
strong than drugs in all maladies ' over
â which the mind dominates, but aside from
its medicinal value, it proves more read
ily than any other known force that the
astral body can be separated from tha
material and has the power after an
absence to return to earth. â¢ That this is
not merely a statement but a proved fact
I myself can bear testimony.
For the benefit of the students and in
vestigators in this line of thought I will
cite an instance which took place in Paris
one year ago, myself being the subject.
Before the organization of the Interna
tional Society . of Psychical Research,
which 5s now centered in Paris, , and
of which,, upon my return to that coun
try, I will become a member, a number
in the advanced thought were In the cus
tom of meeting and discussing these
questions of universal interest in the
home of Camille Flammarion, who is an
astronomer and psychologist of world
wide reputation. Among those who at
tended were Dr. Eucausse, the occult
writer, who will be' better recognized by
his pseudynom, "Papus," and the Count
de Rochas, the administrator of the Poly
technic School of France, the greatest
school of naval engineering in the world.
I give the professions of these men that
all may know they are. men of high au
thority and standing in their country, and
that those meetings were held strictly
for scientific investigation, and were not
what is commonly known in this land aa
seances.
Upon request of Mrs. Flammarion, who
was also present, I submitted myself as
a subject, and by Count de Rochas, who
is an ardent exponent of the varying
phases of hypnotism, was. magnetized, or
hypnotized. By the testimony, of those
present I soon entered into a state of
deep catalepsy, my physical body being
entirely insensible to feeling 1 . The soul,
or ego, had separated from, the. material,
but still remained and spoke in a voice
recognized as my own, saying that I was
very happy to be released. â¢ When it 'was
thought advisable to recall me I protest
ed, and refused to respond to the most
earnest efforts of the hypnotist, and . it
was only by the combined will force of
all present that I "returned to the ma
terial body.
The. theory which Count de Rochas
puts forth after ten years' investigation

EXPERIMENTS

la mat a subject under hypnotic influ
ence can exteriorize the astral body,
make" it depart- a certain distance from
the material body, and when the air is
grasped, as one would grasp I an arm
where the astral body is, it will be felt
in the material or physical. It has been
verified by eminent seers that the breath
of this projection or astral- body carries
sensibility with it.
Another Instance showing the advance
ment of psychology by means of hypno
tism Is that of Count de:Rocbas and the
well-known. Parisian model, Lina, his
subject. To this meeting, which also took
place in France in the .; residence of M.
Gailhard, the director of grand opera In
Paris, came Swami JVivikananda,' who is
known in San Francisco, | and my friend
and fellow student, who., was also one-of

der Naillen, besides Count de Rochas,

ing is unquestioned. â  The . object of this
particular meeting was; to note the; effact
of music upon the astral body and to
witness,: if possible, a demonstration of
dematerialization. â 
For this . purpose ' the director of tho
Conservatory of Music brought â  a- j book
containing some very ancient dances. No
one present had previously heard a note
of . the music , or : had '. any knowledge ' of.
the motions ' which should be shown In
the dance.' So there was no Â» possibility
of mental suggestion. The girl Lina^was
chosen particularly for her grace, for she
was .physically perfect, but in intellect
somewhat deficient.;. However, ; upon the
first' chord of r this music, which was
played' Vby'^'M. Paul VIdal, Mile.
Lina,' tinder began 'to dance,
executing | the | most graceful : movements,
swayed by, the music when gay or sad.
Finally ', some .one present J called ; for the
Spanish habanera, which I, also .. en
chanted â  by the* rhythm, began to sing.
Upon, my .joining,, Lina, apparently ex
alted by tho combined symphony ; of
sounds, became much excited, and danced
with even greater abandon, . and her
poses and grace, became so ravishlngly
beautiful that M. Gailhard. who: had
a'. ' camera with . him . for. - the purpose,'
caught her in .several of hermost grace
ful poses. ' â  .'; / ; .
Upon the development of the negatives
thus made 'Some astonishing results of
dematerialization,'' ;whlch our. eyes had
.failed, to .see, > were â found. Through the
influence of hypnotism ; and the power of
music Lina was discovered, by.! the sen
sitized -plate of the camera which ' de
tects what ' is . invisible to the , physical
eye,- to' have partially, dematerialtzed. The
anterior portion of Una's body had given
forth I effluvia or emanations; of magnet

dence of .the camera the arms had en-
tirely melted Into those streams of llfffct
and the head had completely disap
peared.
Count da Rochas In an artlda In a
paper, devoted to science states that ha
afterward made a careful examination
with a magnifying glass of the plates
showing the extraordinary results of the
experiment, but that he failed to find any
imperfection in the negative and found no
flaws whatever In the method of pho
tography used. The- subject, Lina, upon
recovering her normal state felt no phy
sical exhaustion, and asida from a cer
tain languidneas was in no way affected.
She is alive now and still follows her pro-Â»
f ession as a model in Paris.
I had a remarkable experience In Pasa
dena during my recent visit there. Ona
day my maid and I were driving out of
Pasadena along a quiet, shady road when
we met a little, decrepit old man trudging:
along laboriously with a staff. As wa
neared him he doffed his hat reverently,
and bowing In unison remarked, "I've
been wanting to see you." We -were
frightened, and onÂ© of us ejaculated some
thing about robbers, but reassuring Â«Â»
with a pacific wave of his hand ha con
tinued: "Yes, it is you. Calve, that I
have been wishing to see." TVhereupoa
we stopped the carriage and listened.
He was from 'India, ha said, and his
bronze features set the stamp of truth on
his utterance. He was on a divine mis
sion from his beloved "guru" (teacher) to
gather followers for tha great Gautama,
known to Christendom as Buddha, Im
parting his blessing upon ma and receiv
ing my well wishes in return, ha turned
away, repeating several times, "I will sea
you again; I will see you again," and I
returned, mystified, to the hotel.
That evening. I learned to my horror
that the keys to my trunks had been lost
during the drive, and I was mourning
over this catastrophe when word cams
from the office that a dwarfish old man
waited at the desk with my keys, but was
desirous of delivering them in person. I
consented, thinking that he sought a re
ward, but on his appearance was amazed
to recognize the same- little man whom I
had encountered during the drive and who
had disappeared mumbling, "I will see
you again."
I suspected some supernatural agency
and resolved to put It to test. Takinff
some dried and withered flowers from a
vase I demanded that the dwarf prove
his claims of being tha authorized emis
sary of the Buddhist cult by instantly re
storing flowers, foliage and stems to their
pristine freshness. He called for a bowl
of water "and a cloth, which I gave him.
but I smiled at hi3 simplicity, for tha
bouquet had dried to the point of brittle
ness. Nevertheless the little man pro
ceeded with all confidence, placed tha
flowers In the bowl and covered them with
the cloth, after the accepted manner of
all masters of legerdemain. Then he be
gain repeating the holy mantra of Bud
dhism and the sacred a-u-m of hia caste,
exorcising by various incantations the
spirits of darkness, conjuring those of
light and summoning them to his aid. The
cloth moved, and lifting It away I beheld
my dead and shrunken flowers as fresh
and bright as when they came from tha
garden sparkling with dew.
I have cited but a few of the wonderful
experiences which I have had In investi
gating the occult. In conclusion let mo
say that I am not a spiritualist, but In
the reality of psychic phenomena, and- toe
existence of psychic fi-'^c X do unreserv
edly believe.

IRRIGATION
SYSTEM I-N
THE UNITED
STATES.
THE Colorado Desert is being; wiped
from ihe map of California, and mi
its place there is growing up very
rapidly an extensive, prosperous
and wealthy community that will
in the next few years add many millions
to the assessment roll, of the State, many
thousands of names to the Great Register
and one more to the family of counties.
In the Beginning.
About fifty years ago Dr. Wozencraft
cf San Bernardino commenced an investi
gation of a project to reclaim this dese-t
by means of v.-ater taken from the Colo
rado River. I-lÂ«, presented his plans to
Congress, asking for a grant of the lands
In 1Â£S the Committee on Public Lands
In the House of Representatives reported
favorably en the concessions asked for.
About the same time the State of Cali
fornia conditionally surrendered its claim
to the lands in that countryâ lands that
â were absolutely of no value.
Engineers reported to both the State
and the National Governments endorsing
the plans proposed by Dr. Wozencraft,
which contemplated a heading: en the
Colorado River, at what was known as
the Har.lon Heading and the use of the
Carter River channel through lower Cali
fornia to convey the water of the Colo
rado River to the lands to be irrigated.
Other Business.
Soon after this the civil war broke out
and the project was necessarily aban
doned.
Dr. Wozencraft evidently lived about
lialf a century to<i soon. Had he suc
ceeded in getting his grant from Congress
and interesting capital to construct his
expensive works there is no doubt
that an attemjit to have colonized these
lands at that time would have been a
failure.
Land, Water and Man.
Land without water has no value: wa-
ter without land has no value, and water
and land without man to utilize them
have no value.
The great question in reclaiming the
Colorado delta has been, would the man
come alone: and utilize the land and wa
ter when 'they were bnhight together?
Magnitude of the Enterprise.
This Colorado delta Is the largest body
of arid land susceptible of irrigation to be
found in the United States, and has a
moie than abundant supply of water In
the Colorado River to Irrigate the same.
In this delta there are fully 500,000 aereÂ»
of choice land that can be irrigated In the
State of California, and 300,000 acres more
that can be Irrigated across the line In
Lower California.
There are two kinds of desertsâ the re
clairnable and the Irreclaimable. The re
claimable Sesert consists of a fertile soil,
that is desert only because of its aridity.
Plenty of water win convert such a desert
Into fertile fields. The irreclaimable des-
ert is composed of sand, gravel and
bowlders, and can never be made of any
value by the application of water.
The Colorado delta Is composed of the
most fertile soil to be found in the world,
not even excepting the celebrated valley
of the Nile. The soil is a sedimentary
deposit brought dawn by the waters of
the, Colorado River while it was at work
digging out the Grand Canyon of the Col
orado.
Another Move Made. â¢ "
After the abandonment of the Dr. Wo
zencraft proposition the question of re
claiming the Colorado delta was laid to
rÂ«st for nearly forty years. â¢
About J890 other attempts were made to
reclaim this great desert, but on ac
count of the panic of 1S9Â£ and other
causes nothing was accomplished in the
way of construction until 1900, although
extensive surveys were made, land was
purchased and a valuable property was
accumulated. â 'â¢â 'â  - 'â¢ .
During the spring of 1900 " Mr, George
Chaftey, having made a careful and ex
tensive examination of the entire enter
prise, contracted with the California De
velopment Company for an interest In the
company and undertook to. deliver water
on the desert within a given time.
A Competent Irrigation Engineer.
Mr. George Chaffey is well known In
California and in Australia as one of the
leading Irrigation engineers of this ace.
He has always managed his own enter
prises successfully, and has never man
aged enterprises -for other' people. He
founded Ontario and Etiwandaâ two suc
cessful irrigation settlements In Southern
California, and then, on the . invitation
of the Australian Government, he went
to that country and _, established Mildura
and Renroark, furnishing the' water-to
these . settlements by means of â¢ mam
moth pumping plants, which cost over
$500,000â eight of^ the centrifugal pumps
having discharge pipes each four feet in
diameter. All of his irrigation enterprises
have been successful. y
Work. Commenced.
â¢ In April, 1900, actual work was com
menced and it . has - been pushed rapidly
ever since.
In June? 1901, an abundant supply of
water was delivered through the new
canal system, crossing the International
boundary line, back-into the. State of Cal
ifornia again, about sixty miles west of
the Coiorado River.
; During the. year prior to the delivery of
water the work of resurveyingthe public
lands' and laying plans for the settlement
of the 'country progressed favorably, and
at the end of the year there had â  bean
over one hundred thousand acres of land
filed -upon by prospective settlers either
under, the desert land act or under the

tions, although about 1200 acres of
sorghum and millet were planted so as
to "furnish feed for the hundreds of
horses that were at work on the canal
system and other hundreds of horses and
cattle that would be brought into the
settlements by actual settlers before any
thing could be raised in' the spring of 1903.
This' first trial of the soil and climate was
eminently satisfactory.
A Gigantic Enterprise.
The work of colonizing and reclaiming
the Colorado delta is one of the most
gigantic enterprises ever attempted in
California, Because of its magnitude the
canal system ' was- called the Imperial
Canal and Imperial Settlements Is the
name by which that section of country is
now known.
What Has Been Done.
Settlers have taken possession of. 125,000
acres of land and secured water rights
for the same from the Imperial Canal sys
tem. This system of canals has been so
far extended that water can be used this
next season on practically any of the
land now taken from the Government. .,
The town of Imperial has been' platted
and business has been started there in
good style. There Is a hotel, a .postofflce,
a general merchandise store, a stage sta
tion, a printing office where the Imperial
Pressâ a twelve-page paper, with, four
columns to, the pageâ is' printed, a church
with a parsonageâ a- regular, little, white
New England church, with a spireâ and
the First National Bank of Imperial has
been organized and will be ready for busi
ness by the first of next year. .*â  '
ThÂ© town of Calexico has also been plat
ted. It is located on the boundary line
about sixteen miles south of Imperial.
Here is to be found the headquarters of
the California Development Company in
a large, double, adobe building. A general
merchandise store is also, to be found
here and the town only a few weeks old
is growing finely. â
The town of Parlnga Is platted, but no
improvements have been made there yet.
It is located midway between the other
two towns. '-'
The town of Imperial Is located about
twenty-eight miles south of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, and is connected with
that road by a dally stage line.
Railroads to Be Built.
The. Los Angeles, Imperial and Arizona
Railway Company will be Incorporated
very soon to build ftbout 400 miles of rail
road. This road is^ planned to be built
from Yuma westward through the Impe
rial Settlements via Calexico, Paringa and
Imperial toward Los Angeles, and will be
either extended to that city or connected
with some other standard gauge railroad
that will make satisfactory connection
with the southern metropolis, j There will
then be one branch line built
northward from Imperial to con
nect, w-lth the Southern Pacific,
and another .branch line southward
from Calexico to the head of the Gulf of
California. The road from the Southern
Pacific to Imperial, thence to Calexico,
will be graded during the coming winter
and will be put in active running order
soon thereafter.
In addition to this railroad enterprise,
the. building of which is now assuredâ
although little has been said about, itâ the
people of San Diego are moving to build
a railroad eastward from that city which,
when built, will give the Imperial Set
tlements another outlet to the coast.
A Telephone System.
A telephone line is now In operation
from Flowingwell W Imperial and Calex
ico, with a branch linfe from FlowingweU
to. Iris to connect with the Western Union
telegraph line.
population of the Imperial Settle
"ments during the past year has Increased
from practically nothing to over 1000 peo
ple, and the Increase has mostly Ween
made during the past two months. ,r\.
Such is the development of what prom
ises to be one of the most noted and pro
ductive sections of this State of garden
spots.
Trade in Whiskers of Mice
and" Bears' Eyebrows.
THE business done in mouse whiskers
Is considerable this year, for they
are used in the making of the won
derful new fly for fishermenâ the
"new gray gnat." And they are expen
siveânearly two cents per whisker. Trout
rise very much better at mouse whisker
flies than at the same "gnat" dressed
in jinglecock hackles, which look much
like them. > ;*';'
The trade of artificial fly making is the
lightest-fingered business In the world
and, it is. not one man or "woman 'out of
5000 who can learn to tie flies. These
tyers are remarkable for the beauty and
delicacy of their, hands, and only the
cleverest of fingers can deal with the
"niggling", work of knotting hairs that
can. hardly be seen.
In makins a fly . tha earth -has to be
ransacked for precisely the correct fwtth
era and hairs, and ons hair wrong will
make all the difference. ' v ""â /;;â¢*
It takes an expert tier only fifteen min
utes to turn out a fly, which consists of
a tiny hook, with wings of Egyptian
dove feather, legs of fox hair and a body
of mouse fur, wound round with a thread
of yellow silk. A carelessly madÂ© fly will
have neither legs nor "feelers," but the
true expert adds the legs and puts on a
pair of long "feelers" of cat hair, whlto
at the tips. All these tiny details will bo
exactly in their places and so finely tied
to the hook that the fly will takÂ» half a
dozen strong fish and ba none the worse.
Bear's eyebrows, . being stiff, and ex
actly the right shade, are used in a new
ly invented fly that Is killing Quantities
of salmon this year, and these eyebrows
come from, the Himalayan brown bear
and cost about $1 60 per set. There are
always agents all over the world search
iÂ«Vf tropical forests for the right birds to
supply fly hackles, and one of the most
sought after skins Is that of the rare
"green screamer," an African bird, about
the size of a fowl, which has a tiny
bunch of feathers on each shoulder that
is worth $15 per bunch to the flymaker.
One of these birds only supplies feathers
enough for half a dozen files. Numbers
of men spend their Ilves-and lose them,
too-in collecting the right kinds of birds
for fly feathers.
Thero is no limit to the enthusiasm of
an artistic fly tier, who will use hair
fxom his own eyelashes to finish off an
extra soecial fly. Baby's hair Is a much
sough It Â« material, if of the rignj
shade-golden yellow-for all the lighter'
Simon flies, and one curl will make a
doz^n first 'class flies. There^re many

THE THRONE
CHAPTER XXâ Continued.
THE APPROACHING ORDEAL.
Y Y*\ ITHIN a very few minutes af trr
\ A / they had been conducted to tha
V V/ chamber by Count Half ont and
> \ other dignitaries the fair ruler
came into the room and ad
vanced between the bowing lines of
courtiers to the spot where sat the
man who held Graustark in his grasp.
A slender, graceful figure In black,
proud and serious, she walked un
hesitatingly to the old man's side. If she
feared him. If she was impressed by his
power, she did not show It. The little
drama had two stars of equal magnitude,
neither of whom acknowledged supremacy
in the other.
Bolaroz arose as she drew near, his
Jaunt face black and unfriendly. She ex
tended her hand graciously, and he, a
Prince for all his wrath, touched his
trembling lips to its white., smooth back.
"I come in grief and saflnees to . your
court, most glorious Yetive. -My burden
of sorrow is greater than I can bear," he
said, hoarsely.
"Would that I could give you consola
tion," she said, sitting In the chair re
served for her use at council gatherings.
"Alas! it grieves me than I can offer
nothing more than words."
"You are the one he would have made
his wife." said the old Prince, sitting be
side her. He looked into her <JÂ«Â«o blue
eyes and tears sprung to his own. His
voice Jailed him, and long moments passed
before he could control his emotion. Truly
she pitied him In his bereavement.
Then followed a formal discussion of the
crime and the arrangement of details In
connection -with the removal of the dead
Prince from Graustark to his own land.
These matters settled, Bolaroz said that
he had heard of the murderer's escape
and asked what effort was being made to
recapture him. Yetive related all that
had happened, expressing humiliation over
the fact that her officers had been unable
to accomplish anything, adding that she
did not believe the fugitive could get away
from Graustark safely without her
knowledge. The old Prince was working
timself back Into the violent rage that
had been temporarily subdued, and at last
broke out In a vicious denunciation of the
carelessness that had allowed the man to
escape. He first insisted that Dangloss
and his incompetent assistants be thrown
into prison for life or executed for crim
inal negligence : then he demanded the life
cf Harry Anguish as an aider and abettor
in the flight of the murderer. In both
cases the Princess firmly refused to take
the action, demanded. She warmly de
fended Dangloss and his men, and an â¢
nour.eed In no uncertain tones that she
would not crder the arrest of the remain
ing American. Then ehe acquainted him
with her intention to detain Anguish as
hostage and to have his every action
watched in the hope that a clue to the
whereabouts of the fugitive might be Â«<jk
covcrod, providing, of course, that the
friend knew anything at all about ihe
matter. The Duke of Mizrox and others
loudly joined in the cry for Ang-ulsh's ar
rest, but she bravely held out against
them and in the end curtly lnformcl
them that the American, whom she be
lieved to be Innocent of all complicity ia
the escape, should be subjected to no in
dignity other than detention in the city
under guard, as she had ordered.
"I Insist that this man be cast Into
prison at ence," snarled the white-lipped
Bolarcz.
Her eyes flashed and her bosom heaved
with Â£cger.
"You are not at liberty to command In
Graustark, Prince Bolaroz." she said,
slowly and distinctly. "I am ruler here."
The heart of every Graustark nobleman
leaped with pride at this daring rebuff.
Bolarcz gasped and was speechless for
seme seconds.
"You shall not be ruler long, madam,"
he said, malevolently, significantly.
"But I am ruler now, and, as such, I
command you to withdraw from my cas
tle, sir. I did not know that I was to
submit to these threats and insults, or 1
should not have been kind enough to
grant you an audience, Prince though
you are. When I came to this room It
v.-as to give you my deepest sympathy
and to receive yours, not to be Insulted.
You have lost a son, 1 my betrothed. It
ill becomes you. Prince Bolarcz, to vent
ycur \1ndlctiveness upon me. My men
are doing all in their power to capture
the mÂ«tn who has so unfortunately es
caped from our clutches, and I shall not
allow you or any one elee to dictate the
manner in which we are to proceed." She
uttered these words cuttingly, and, at
their conclusion, arose to leave the room.
Bolarcz heard her through in surprise
and with conflicting emotions. There
v.-as no mistaking her indignation, so he
ueemec it policy to bottle his wrath,
overlook the most offensive rebuke his
vanity had ever received, and submit to
what vas evidently a Just decision.
"Stay, your Highness. I eubmit to your
proposition regarding the other stranger,
although I doubt its wisdom. There Js
but oa; In whom I*am really interestedâ
the one who killed my eon. There Is to
be no cessation In the effort to find him, I
am to understand. I now have a propo
sition. With n-.e are 300 of my bravest
soldiers. 1 offer them to you In order
that you may better prosecute the search.
They will remain here and you may use
them in any woy you see fit. The Duke
of Mizrox will linger In Edelweiss and
v.ith him you and yours may always con
fer. He, also. Is at your command. This
man must be retaken. I sweskr. by all that
is above and below me. he shall be found.
M I hunt the world over to accom
plish that end. He shall not escape
my vengeance! And hark you to
this! On the twentieth of next month I
shall demand payment of the debt due
Axphain. So deeply is my heart set on
the death of this Grenfall Lorry that I
agree new, before all these friends of
ours, that if he be captured and executed
In my presence before the twentieth of
Xovember, Graustark shall be granted
the extension of time that would have
in the event of your espousal
with the man he killed. You hear this
offer. Â»!!? It Is bound by my sacred
word cf honor. His death before the
twentieth gives Graustark ten years of
grace. If he is still at larpe I shall claim
:ny own. This offer. I believe, most gra
cious Yetive, will greatly encourage your
people in the effort to capture the man
we geek."
The Princess heard the remarkable
p-oposiUon with face deathly pale, heart
scarcely beating, /.gain was the duty
to Graustark thrust cruelly upon her. She
could save the one only by sacrificing the
other.
"We will do all in our power toâ to
;>rove ourselves grateful for your mag
nanimous offer," she said. As she passed
from the room on the arm of her uncle,
â -he heard the increasing: buzz of excite
ment on all sides, the unrestrained ex
pressions oi. amazement and relief from
her own subjects, the patronizing com
ments of the visitors, all conspiring to
sound her doom. Which way was she
fcÂ» turn in order to escape from herself?
"We must catch this man, Yetive," paid
H.-iIfont en the stairway. "There Is no
::Hernaiive."
% "Except our Inability to do so," she
- murmured. In that moment she deter
mined ihat Gronfall Lorry should never
be taken if she could prevent it. He was
innccent and it v.-as Graustark's penally
to pay.
The text day, amid pomp and splen-
dor, the Prince of Axphain started on his
Journey to the land erf his forefathers,
to the tombs of his ancestors, all Edel
weiss witnessing the imposing procession
that made Its way through the north
gates of the town. Far up on the moun
tain top a. man, looking from his little
window, saw the black, snake-like pro
cession wind away across the plain to the
northward, losing Itself In the distant
hills.
XXI-FROM A WINDOW ABOVE.
The longest month In Lorry's life was
that which followed his romantic flight
from the tower. To his impatient mind
the days were irksome weeks. The cold
monastery was worse than a prison. He
looked from Its windows as a convict
looks through his bars, always hoping:, al
ways disappointed. "With each of the In
frequent visits of Captain Quinnox his
heart leaped at the prospect of liberty,
only to sink deeper in despair upon the re
ceipt of emphatic though kindly assur
ances that the time had not yet come for
him to leave the haven of safety into
which he had been thrust by loving hands.
Prom his little window he could see the
active city below, with the adored castle:
to his nostrils came the breath of summer
from the coveted valley, filling him with
almost insupportable longing and desire.
Cold were the winds that swept about his
lofty home; ghastly, grewsome the nights;
pallid and desolate the days. Out of the
world was he, dreary and heartsick, while
at his feet stretched life and joy and love
in their rarest habiliments. How he en
dured the suspense, the torture of uncer
tainty, the craving for the life that
others were enjoying, he could not under
stand. Big, strong and full of vigor, his
Inactivity was maddening; this virtual
captivity grew more and more intolerable
with each succeeding day. Would they
never take him from the tomb In which
he was existing? A hundred times had
he, in his desperation, concluded to flee
from the monastery, come what might,
and to trust himself to the joyous world
below, but the ever-present though wan-
Ing spark of wisdom won out against the
fierce, aggressive folly that mutinied
within his hungry soul. He knew that
she was guarding him with loving, ten
der care, and that when the proper time
came the shackles of danger would drop
and his way would be cleared.
Still there was the longing, the craving,
the loneliness. Day by day, night after
night went by and the end seemed no
nearer. Awake or asleep, he dreamed of
her, his heart and mind always full of
that one rich blessingâ her love. At
times he was mad with the desire to know
what she was doing, what she was think
ing and what was being done for her down
there in that busy world. Lying on his
pallet, sitting in the narrow window, pac
ing the halls or wandering about the cold
courtyards, he thought always of her,
hoping and despairing with equal fervor.
The one great question that jnade his
imprisonment, his inactivity so irksome
was, Was lie to possess the treasure he
longed so much to call his own? In those
tantalizing moments of despair he felt
that If he were free and near her ne
could win the light against all odds. As
It was, he knew not what mischief was
working against his chances in the world
from which he was barred.
The prior was kind to him; everything
that could be done to provide comfort
where comfort was a stranger was em
ployed in his behalf. He lived wellâ until
his appetite deserted him; be had uo
questions to answer, for no one asked
why he was there; he s had no danger to
fear, for no foe knew Where he lived.
From the city came the promise of ulti
mate escape; verbal messages from those
who loved him; news of the worldâ ail at
long intervals, however. Qulnnox's visit*
were like sunbeams to him. The dashing
captain came only at night and in dis
guise. He bore verbal messages, a wise
precaution against mishap. Not once did
he bring a word of love from the Prin
cess, an omission which caused the fugi
tive deep misery until a ray of intelli
gence showed him that she could not give
to Quinnox the speeches from her heart,
proud woman that she was.
Anguish sent words of cheer, with com
mands to be patient. He oever failed to
tell him. through Quinnox, that he was
doing all in his power to find the real
murderer and that he had the secret co
opeiation cf the old police captain. Of
course, the hidden man heard of the re
ward and the frenzied search prosecuted
by both principalities: He laughed hys
terically over the deception that was be
ing practiced by the blue-eyed, slender
woman who held the key to the situation
in her keeping.
It was not until the night of the 18th
of November thai Quinnox confirmed his
fears by telling him of the conditions im
posed by Prince Bolaroz. For some rea
son the young officer had deceived Lorry
In regard to the all-important matter.
The American repeatedly had begged for
information about tne fatal twentieth, but
on all previous occasions his visitor dog
gedly maintained a show of ignorance,
' vowing that he knew nothing of the cir
cumstances. Finally Lorry, compietely
out of patience and determined to
know the true state of affairs,
soundly upbraided him and sent
word to the Princess that if she
did not acquaint him with the inside
facts he would leave the monastery and
rind them out for himself. This authori
tative message brought Quinnox back
two nights later with the full story of
the exciting conference. She implored
him to remain where he was, and asked
his forgiveness for having kept the ugly
truth from him. Quinnox added to his
anguish by hastily informing him that
there was a possibility of succor from
another principality. Prince Gabriel, he
said, not knowing that he was cutting
hi* listener to the heart, was daily with
the Princess, and It was believed that he
was ready to loan Graustark sufficient
money to meet the demand of Bolaros.
The mere thought that Gabriel was with
her aroused the fiercest resentment in
Lorry's breast. He writhed beneath the
knowledge that she was compelled to en
dure his advances, his protestations of
love, his presence.
As he paced his narrow room distract
edly a horrid thought struck him so vio
lently that he cried aloud and staggered
against the wall, his eyes lixed on the
face of the startled soldier. Perhaps she
might submit to Gabriel, for in .submit
ting Rhe could save. not only Graustaik,
but the man -ehe loved. The sacrificeâ
but no! he would not believe that such
affliction could come to herl Marry Ga
briel! The man who had planned to seize
her and make her his wanton! Ho
cround his teeth and glared at Quinnox
as if he wero the object of his hatred,
his vicious jealousy. The captain stepped
backward In sudden alarm; ...
"Don't be afraid!" Lorry cried, sav
agely. "I'm not crasy. It's your newoâ
your news! Docs she expect me Jo stay
up here- while that state of affairs exists
down there? Let me see; this is the 18th,
and day after to-morrow is the 20th.
There Is no time to be lost, Captain Quin
nox. I shall accompany you when you
leave St. Valentine's to-night."
â "Impossible!" exclaimed Quinnox. "I
cannot allow that, sir. My instructions
"Hang your Instructions! All the In
structions on earth can't compel mo to
sit up here and see this sacrifice made.
I am determined to see her and put a
stop to the whole affair. It is what I
feared would come to pass. She is wlll
luc to sacrifice herself or half her klng-
dom, one or the other, in order that I
may escape. It's not right, captain, it's
not right, and I'm going to stop It. How
soon can we leave this place!" He was
pacing the floor, happy in the decision he
had reached, notwithstanding the danger
it promised.
"You are mad, sir, to talk like ; this,"
protested the other, despairingly. '.'Edel
weiss swarms with Axphain soldiers; our
own men are on the alert to win the great
reward. You cannot go to the city.
When a safe time comes you will be ta
ken from this place into the mountains
instead of through the city, and given
escort to Dassas, one hundred miles east.
That step will not be taken until the way
is perfectly clear. I tell you, sir, you
cannot hope to escape if you leave the
monastery now. The mountains are full
of soldiers every night."
"I didn't say anything about an escape,
did I? On the contrary. I want to give
myself up to her. Then sho can have
Gabriel thrown" over the castle wall and
say to Bolaroz, 'Here is your man; I've
gained the ten years of grace.' That's
the point, Quinnox; can't you see It?
And I want to say to you now, I'm. going
whether you consent or refuse. I'd Just
a^ soon be In jail down there as up here,
anyhow. The only favor I have to ask
of you is that you do the best you can
to get me safely to her. I must talk with
her before I go back to the tower."
"God help me, sir, I cannot take you
to her," groaned Quinnox, trying to con
trol his nervous apprehension. "I have
sworn to her that I will keep you from
all harm, and it would be to break faith
with her if I led you Into that mob down
there." . (
"I respect your oath, my friend, but I
am going, just the same. I'll see her,
too, If I have to shoot every man who
attempts to prevent me. I'm desperate,
man, desperate! She's everything in the
world to me, and I'll die before I'll see
her suffer."
Quinnox calmly placed his hands on the
other's shoulders, and, looking him in the
eye, said quietly :
"Her sutterin:; now is as nothing com
pared to what it will be if you go back
to the tower. You forget how much
pain she is enduring to avoid that very
suffering. If you care for my mistress,
sir, add no weight to the burden she al
ready carries. Remain here, as she de
sires. You can be of no service down
there. I Implore you to be considerate."
It was an eloquent appeal, and it
struck home. Lorry wavered, but . hla
resolution would not weaken. He argued
first with Quinnox, then with himself,
finally returning to the reckless deter
mination to brave all and save her from
herself. The . soldier begged him. to
listen to reason, implored nan to recon
sider, at last turning in anger upon the
stubborn American with a torrent of
maledictions. Lorry heard him through
and quietly, unswervingly announced that
he was ready to leave the monastery at
any time his guide cared to depart. Quin
nox gave up in despair at. this, gazinjf
hopelessly at the man he had sworn to
protect, who insisted on placing his head
in the lion's Jaw. He eat down at the
window and murmured dejectedly:
"What will she say to meâ wnat will
she say to me?"
"I shall exonerate you, captain. She can
have no fault to find with your action
after I have told her how loyal you are
and howâ howâ well, how unreasonable I
am," said Lorry, kindly.
"You may never live to tell her this,
sir. Then what is to become of me? ; I
could not look her in the face again. . I
could only, die."
"Don't be so faint hearted, Quinnox!"
cried Lorry, stimulated by the desire to
be with her, recognizing: no obstacle that
might thwart him in the effort. "We'll
get through, safe and sound, and we'll
untangle a few complications before we
reach the end of the book. Brace up, for
God's sake, for mine, for hers, for-your
own. I must get to her before every
thing is lOEt. My God, the fear that sho
may marry Gabriel will drive me' mad if
I am left here another night. Come! Let
us prepare to start. We must notify the
Abbot that I am to go. I can be ready
in five minutes. Ye gods, think of what
she may be sacrificing for me."
The distracted captain gloomily
watched the nervous preparations for
departure, seeing his own disgrace ahead
as plainly as If it had already come upon
him. Lorry soon was attired In 'the
guard's uniform he had worn from the
tower a month fcefore. His .pistol was in
his pocket, and the bunch of violets she
had sent to him that very night was
pinned defiantly above his heart. Quin
nox smiled when he observed this bit of
sentiment, and grimly informed him that
he was committing an act prohibited in
Dangloss's disciplinary rules. Officers on'
duty were not to wear nosegays. .
"Dangloss will not see my violets. By
the way, the moon shines brightly,
doesn't it 7"
"It Is almost as light as day. Our trip
Is made extremely hazardous for that rea
son. I am sorely afraid, rash sir, that we
cannot reach" the castle unseen."
"We must go about it boldly, that's
all."
"Has It occurred to you, sir, that you
are placing me in a terrible position?
What excuse can I have, a captain of the
guard, for slinking about at night with
a man whom I am supposed to be track
ing to earth? Discovery will brand me as
a traitor. I cannot deny the charge with
out exposing her Majesty."
Lorry turned cold. He had not thought
of this alarming possibility. But hJs
ready wit came again to his relief, and
with bright, confident eyes he swept
awny the obstacle.
"If discovered you are at once to pro
claim me a prisoner, take the credit for
having caught me, and claim the re
ward."
"In that case you will not go to the cas
tle, but to the tower."
"Not if you obey orders. The offer of
jeward says that I must be delivered to
the undersigned. You will take me to her
and not to the tower." \
Quinnox smiled and threw up his hands
as if unable to combat the quick logic of
his companion. Together they made their
way to tho prior's cell, afterward to the
Abbot's apartment. It was barely 11
o'clock and ho had not retired. Ho ques
tioned Quinnox closely,' bade Lorry fare
well and blessed him, sent his benediction
to tho Princess and ordered them con
ducted to tho gates.
Ten minutes later they stood outside the
wall, tho great gates having been closed
Eharply behind them. Above them hung
the silvery moon, full and bright, throw
ing its refulgent splendor over the moun
tain top with all. the brilliancy of day.
Never had Lorry seen . the moon so ac
cursedly bright. /
" 'Gad, it is like day," ho exclaimed. â¢
"As I told you, sir," agreed the other,
reproof In his voice.
"We must wait until tho â¢ moon goes
down. It won't do to risk It now. Can
we not go somewhere to keep warm for,
an hour or so?" .
"There is a cave farther down the
mountain. Shall we take the chances of
reaching it?"
"By all means. I can't endure the cold
after being cooped up for ho long."
. They followed the winding road for
some distance down the mountain, com
ing at last to a point where a small path
branched off. It was the path leading
down the side of the steep overlooking
the- city, and upon that side no 'wagon
road could be built. Seven thousand feet

Standing out oil the brow, of* the moun
tain they seemed to be the only living ob
jects in the world. There was no sign of
life above, below or beside them.
"How long should we be In making the

possessing him as he looked from the
dizzy height into the ghost-like dimness

"And how are we to get into the castle?
I hadn't thought of that."
. "There is a secret entrance," said Quin
nox maliciously, enjoying the insistent
one's acknowledgment of weakness. , "If
we reach it safely I can take you under
ground to the old dungeons beneath the
castle. It may be sometime before you
can enter the halls above." for the secret
of that passage is guarded Jealously.
There are but five people who know of
its existence."
"Great confidence is placed in you, I see,
and worthily, I am sure. How is that you
are trusted so implicitly?" . '
"I Inherit the confidence. The captain
of, the guard is born to his position. My
ancestors held the place before me and
ndt one betrayed the trust. The first born
in the last ten generations has been the
captain of the guard in the royal palace,
possessing all its secrets. I shall be the
first to betray the trustâ and for a man
who .is nothing to me." :V '
, "I suppose you consider me selfish and
vile for placing you in this position," said
Lorry, somewhat contritely.
"No; I have begun the task and I will
complete it, come what may," â â > answered
the captain firmly. "You are the only be
ing in the world for whom I would sacri
fice my honor voluntarily â save one."
"I have wondered why you were never
tempted to turn traitor to the Princess
and claim the fortune that Is represented
in the reward."
"Not for five million gawos, sir!"
"By George, you are a faithful lot!
Dangloss, Allode and Ogbot and yourself,
four honest men to whom she trusts her
life, her honor. You belong to a rare
species and I am proud to know you."
The stealthy couple found the cave and
spent an hour or more within its walls,
sallying forth after the tardy darkness
had crept down over the mountair and
into the peaceful valley. Then began the
tortuous descent. Quinnox in the
lead, they walked, crawled and ran
down the narrow path, ' bruised,
scratched and aching by the time
they reached the tonmost of the
summer houses along the face of the
mountain. After this walking was easier,
but stealthiness made their progress slow.
Frequently, as they neared the base, they
were obliged to dodge behind houses or
to drop into the ditches -by the roadside
in order to avoid patrollng police: guards
or Axphain sleuth-hounds. -Lorry mar-;
veled at the vigil the soldiers were keep-
Ing, and was somewhat surprised to learn
from the young captain that prevailing
opinion located him in or near the city.
For this reason, while other men were
scouring Vienna, Paris and even London,
hordes of vengeful men searched day and
night for a clew in the city of Edelweiss.
The fugitive began to realize how de
termined was the effort to capture him
and how small the chance of acquittal if
he were taken. To his fevered imagina
tion the enmity of the whole world was
shaping Itself against him. The air was
charged with hatred, the ground with
vengeance, the trees and rocks with de
nouncing shadows, while from the dark
ness behind merciless hands seemed to be
stretched forth to clutch him. . One sim
ple, loyal love stood alone antagonistic to
the universal desire v to. crush "and kill. A
fragile woman Was shielding, him sturdi
ly, unwaveringly, against all these mighty
forces. His heart thrilled with devotion;
his arm tingted with Joy of clasping' her
once more to his breast; his wistful eyes
hung upon the flickering light far off In
the west. Quinnox had pointed It out. to
him, saying that it burned in the bed
chamber of the Princess Yetive. Since
the memorable night that took him to the
cell in St. Valentine's, ~this light had
burned from dusk to daylight. Lovingly,
faithfully it had shone for him through
all those dreary â¢ nights, a lonely signal
from one heart to another.
,At last, stiff and sore, they stole Into
the narrow streets of Edelweiss. Lorry
glanced Tsack. and shivered, although the
air was warm and balmy. He had truly
been out of the world. Not until this in
stant did he fully appreciate the dread
that possesses a man who is being hunted
down by tireless foes: never, did man's
heart go out in gratitude and trustfulness
as did his toward the strong defender
whose sinewy arm he clasped as if in
terror.'
"You understand what this means to
me," said Quinnox gravely, as they
paused to rest. "She will call me your
murderer and curse me for my miserable
treason. I am the first to dishonor the
name of Quinnox."
XXIIâ GRENFALL LORRY'S FOE.
The Princess Yetive had not flinched a
hair's breadth from the resolution formed
on that stormy night when she sacrificed
pride and duty, on the altar of love and
Justice. Prince Bola^oz's ultimatum over
whelmcd^ her, but she arose from the
wreckage that was" strewn about her con
science and remained loyal, steadfast and
true to the man* in the monastery. To
save his life was all she could hope to
accomplish, and that she was bound to
do at any cost. She could be nothing to
him â not even friend. So long as he lived
he would be considered the murderer of
Lorenz, and until the end a price would
hang over his head. She, Princess of
Graustark, had offered, a reward for him.
For that reason he was always to be a
fugitive, and she least of all could hope
to see' him. There had been a brief, hap
py dream, but it was swept away by the
unrelenting rush of reality. The mere
fact that she and she alone was responsi
ble for his flight placed between them
an unsurmountable barrier.
Clinging tenaciously to her purpose, she
was still cognizant of the debt she owed
the trusting, loving Grauatark. One word
from her could avert the calamity that
was to fall with the dawn of the fatal
20th. All . Graustark blindly trusted
and adored her; to undeceive them would
be to administer a shock from which they
could never, recover.
Her heart was bursting with love for
Lorry; her soul was overflowing with ten
dÂ».r thoughts that could not be sent to
him, much as she trusted to the honor
of Quinnox, her messenger. Hour after
hour she sat In her window and marveled
a* the change that had been wrought in
her life by this strong American, her
eyes fixed on the far-away monastery,
her heart still and cold and fearful. She
had no confidant in this miserable af
fair of the heart. Others, near and dear,
had surmised, but no word of hers con
firmed. A diffidence, strange and proud,
forbade the confession of her frailty,
sweet, pure and womanly though it was.
Sho could not forget that she was a
Princess.
The Countess Dagmar was piqued by
her reticence, and sought in manifold
ways 'to draw forth the voluntary
avowal, with Its divine tears and
blushes. Harry Anguish, who spent
much of his time at the castle and who
invariably deserted his guards at the
portals, was as eager as the Countess to
have her commit herself irretrievably by
word, or sign, but. he, too, was disap
pointed. He was, also, considerably puz
zled. ' Her Majesty's manner was at all
times frank and untroubled. She. was ap
parently light-hearted;- her cheeks had
lost none of their freshness; her eyes
were bright; her smile was quick and
merry;, her wit unclouded. Receptions,
drawing-rooms and* state functions found
her always vivacious, so much so that tier
court wondered not a little. Daily report?
brought no news of the fugitive, but while
others were beginning to acquire the hag
gard air of worry and uncertainty she
was calmly resigned. The 15th, the lu'.u,
the 17th, the ISth and now the. 19th of No
vember came and still the Princess re
vealed no marked sign of distress. <}ouM
they have seen her in the privacy of her
chamber, on those " dreary, maddenin.?
nights they would not have known their
sovereign. 'â ''
Heavy-hearted and with bowed head*
the people of Graustark saw the 19th face,
in the night, the breaking of which would
bring the crush of pride, the end of power.
At court there was the silent dread anu
the dying hope that relief might come at
the last. hour. Men, with pale faces and
tearful eyes, wandered "-through the an
cient jcaatle, speechless, nerveless, miser
able. Brave soldiers crept about, shorn
of pride and filled with woe. Citizens sat
and stared aimlessly for hours, thinking
of naught but the disaster so near, at hand
and so unavoidable. The whole nation
surged as if in the last throes of r death.
To-morrow the potency of Graustark was
to die, Its domain was to be cleft in twain
â disgraced before the world. .
And, on the throne of this afflicted land
sat- the girl, proud, tender, courageous
Yetive. To all Graustark she was it3
greatest, its most devoted sufferer; upon
her. the blow fell heaviest. There she sat,
merciful and merciless, her slim white
hand ready to sign the shameful deed in
transfer, ready . to . sell her kingdom for
her love. , Beneath her throne, beneath
her feet, cowered six souls, possessors of
the secret. Of all the people in the world
they alone knew the heart of the Prin
cess Yetive, they alone felt with her the
weight ! of the sacrifice. With wistful
eyes, fainting hearts and voiceless lips
five of them watched the day approach,
knowing that she . would not speak a.iid
that Graustark was doomed. .Loyal con
spirators against that which" they loved
better than their livesâ their country
were Dangloss, Quinnox, Allode, Ogbot
and Dagmar. To-morrow would see the
north torn from the south, the division of
families, the rending of homes, the burst-
Ing of hearts. She sanctioned all this be
cause she loved him and because Ije had
done no wrong.
Aware of her financial troubles and pur
suing the advantage that his rival's death
had opened to- him, Prince Gabriel /of
Dawsbergen renewed his ardent suit.
Scarce had the body of \ the murdered
Prince left the domain before he made his
presence remarked. She was compelled
to receive, his visits, distasteful as they
were, but she would not hear his propo
sitions. ' :', Knowing that he! was in truth,
the mysterious Michael who had planned
her abduction, she feared and despised
him, yet -dared iriake no public denuncia
tion. As Dawsbergen was too powerful
to be antagonized at this critical time,
she was constantly forced to submit to
the most trying and repulsive ordeals.
Tact and policy were required to control
the violent hot-blooded young ruler from
the south.' At times she despaired and
longed for the quiet of the tomb; at other
times she was consumed by the fires of
resentment, rebelling against the ignom
iny to which she was subjected. Worse
than all to her were the Insolent overtures
of Gabriel. The tears of humiliation shed
utter hl3 departure on the occasion -of
each visit revealed the bitterness . that
was torturing tnis proud martyr.
He had come at once to renew his offer
of a. loan, knowing her helplessness. Day
after day he haunted the castle, persist
ent in his efforts to Induce her to accept
his . proposition. So fierce was his pas
sion, so implacable his desire, that he
went among the people of Edelweiss, pre
senting to them his. ' proposal, hoping
thereby to aad public feeling to his claims.
He tried to organize a committee of citi
zens to go before the Princess with 'a
petition tnat his offer be accepted and the
country saved. But Graustark was loyal
to its Princess. Not one ot her citizens
listened to .the wily Prince, and more
than one told him or his emissaries that
the loss of the whole kingdom was prefer
able to the marriage he desired. Trie city
sickened at- the thought; . .".. â  '
H.is last and master-stroke "In the
struggle to persuade came on the af
.ternoon of the 19th, at an hour when
all Edelweiss was in gloom and
when the Princess was taxed to', the
point where the mask of courage was 'so
trail that she could scare hide her bleed
ing soul behind lt. v
Bolaroz of Axphain, to quote from the
news dispatch, was in Edelweiss, a guest,
with a lew of his lords, in' the castle.
North of the city were encamped live
thousand men. He had come prepared to
cancel the little obligation of fifteen years'
standing. With the hated creditor in the
castle, his Influence hovering above the
town, the populace distracted by the
thoughts of the day to come, Gabriel
played what he considered his best card.
He asked for and obtained a final inter
view with Yetive, not in her boudoir or
her reception-room, but in the throne
room, where she was to meet Bolaroz in
the morning. ' - ' . . , : .
The Princess, seated on her throne,
awaited the approach of the resourceful-,
tenacious suitor. He came and behind
him strode eight stalwart men, a
long iron-bound chest, the result., of his
efforts with his bankers. Yetive and her
nobles looked in surprise on this unusual
performance. Dropping to his knee before
the throne, Gabriel said, his volco
trembling slightly with eagerness and
fear:
"Your Highness, to-morrow will see the
turning point In the history of two, pos
sibly three, nationsâ Graustark, Axphain
and Dawsbergen. I have included my
own land because its ruler Is most vitally
interested. He would serve and save
Graustark, r.s you know, and he would
satisfy Axphain. It Is in my power to
give you uid at this last, trying hour, and
I Implore you to listen to my words of sin
cercat friendshipâ yes, adoration. To-mor
row you are to pay to Prince Bolaroz over
twenty-five million gawos or relinquish
the entire north half of your domain. I
understand the lamentable situation. You
can raise no more than fifteen million
and you are helpless. He will grant no ex
tension of. time. You know what I have
proffered before. I come to-day to repeat
my friendly offer and to give unquestioned
bond as to my ability 'to carry, It out.' It
you agree to accept the loan I extend, ten
million gawos for fifteen years at the
usual rate of Interest, you can on to
morrow morning place in the hand of Ax
phain when he makes his formal demand
the full amount of your Indebtedness in
gold. Ricardo, open the chest!"
â¢An attendant threw open the lid of the
chest. It'was filled with gold coins.'
"This box contains one hundred
thousand ' gawos. There are in
your halls nine boxes holding nine
times â¢ . as much as you see here.
And there are nine times as much all told
on the way. This Is an evidence of my
good faith: Here. Is the gold. Pay Bolaroz
and owe Gabriel, the greatest happiness
that could come to him." .
There wasa dead silence after this the
atrical action. . .. , .
"The interest on this loan is not all you
ask/I understand," said Half ont, slowly,
his black eyes glittering. "You ask some
thing 1 that Graustark cannot and wlllnot
barterâ the hand of Its ; sovereign. If you
are willing to make, this 'loan, naming a
fair rate of interest, withdrawing your
proposal of marriage, we can come to an
Gabriel's eyes deadened with disap
pointment, his breast heaved and his fin
gers twitched.
"I have the happiness of your sovereign
at heart as much as my , own," he said.
"She will never want for devotion, she
will never know a pain."*
"You are determined, then, to adhere to
your original proposition?" demanded the
. Count.
"She would have married Lorenz to save
her land, to protect her people. Am I not
as good as Lorerz? Why not give " be
gan Gabriel, viciously, but Yetive arose,
and with gleaming â  eyes and flushing
cheeks interrupted him.
"Go! I will not hear youâ not one
word!"
'He passed from the room without an
other word.. Her. court saw her standing
straight and immovable, her white face
transfigured.
XXIIIâ THE VISITOR AT MIDNIGHT.
Below the castle and Its distressed oc
cupants, In a dark, damp little room,
Grenfall Lorry lived a year in a day. On
the night of the 18th, or rather near the
break of dawn on the 19th, Captain Quin
nox guided him from the . dangerous
streets of Edelweiss to the secret passage
and he was safe for the time being. The
entrance to the passage was through a
skillfully hidden opening in the wall that
inclosed the park. A stone doorway, so
cleverly constructed that It defied detec
tion, led to a set of steps which, in turn,
took one to a long narrow passage. This
ended in a stairway fully a quarter of a
mile from Its beginning. Ascending this
stairway one came to a secret panel,
through whith, by pressing a spring, the
Interior of the castle was reached.' The
location of the panel was In one of the
recesses in the wall of tfie chapel, near
the altar. It was in this chapel that "rel
ive exchanged her male attire for a loose
gown, weeks before, and the servant who
saw her come from - the door at an un
earthly hour in the morning believed she
had gone there to seek surcease from the
troubles which oppressed her.
Lorry was impatient to rush forth from
his place of hiding and to end all sus
pense, but Quinnox demurred. He bessed
the eager American to remain in the pas
sage until the night of, the 19th, when, all
things going well, he might be so fortu
nate as to reach the Prince3s without
being seen. It was the secret hope of the
guilty captain that his charge could be
induced by the Princess to return to the
monastery, to avoid complications. He
promised to inform her Highness of his
presence in the underground room and to
arrange for a. meeting. The miserable fel
low could not find courage to confess his
disobedience to his trusting mistress.
Many limes during the day she had seen
him hovering near, approaching and then
retreating, and had wondered not a little
at his peculiar manner.
And so it was that Lorry chafed and
writhed through a long day of suspense
and agony. Quinncx had brought to the
little room some candles, food and bed
ding, but he utilized only the former. The
hours went by and no summons called him
to her side. He was dying with the de
sire to hold her in hla arms and to
hear her voice again. Pacing to and fro
like a caged animal, he recalled the ride
in West Virginia, the night In her beÂ«i
chamber, the day in the throne room arfd,
more delicious than all, the trip to the
monastery. In his dreams, walking or
sleeping, he had seen the slim soldier,
had heard the. muffled voice. and had felt
the womanly caresses. His brain now
â was in a whirl, busy with thoughts of
love and fear, distraught with anxiety
for her and for himself, bursting with
the awful consequences of the hour that
was upon them. What was to become at
him? What was to. be the end of this
drama? What would the night, the mor
row bring about?
He looked back and saw himself as he
was a year ago in Washington, before
she came into his life, and then won
dered if it could really be he who was
going through these strange, improbable
scenes, these sensations. It was 9 o'clock
In the evening when Quinnox returned to
the little room. The waiting one had
looked at his watch a hundred times, had
run insanely up and down the passage In
quest of the secret exit, had shouted
aloud In the frenzy of desperation.
"Have you seen her?" he cried, grasp
ing the newcomer's hand.
"I have, but, fcefore' Cod, I could not
tell her what I had done. Your visit will
be a surprise, I fear a shock."
"Then how am I to see her? Fool! Am
I to wait here forever "
"Have patience. I will take 'you to her
to-nightâ aye, within an hour. To-mor
row morning she signs away the northern
provinces, and her instructions are that
she Is not to be disturbed to-nightJ Not
even j will she f see the Countess Dagmar
after 9 o'clock. It breaks my heart to
see the sorrow that abounds in the castle
to-night. Her Highness insists on being
alone, and Basot, the new guard, has or
ders to admit no one to her apartments.
He is ill and I have promised that a sub
stitute shall relieve him at 11 o'clock.
You are to be the substitute. Here Is
a part of an old uniform of mine and
here is a coat that belonged to Dannox,
who was about your size. (Please exchange
the clothes you now have on for these. I
apprehend no trouble in reaching her
door, for the household is in gloom and
the halls seem barren of life."^
He threw the bundle on a chair and
Lorry at once proceeded to don the con
tents. In a very short time he wore,
Instead of the cellkeeper's garments,
a neat fitting uniform of the royal
guard. He was trembling violently,
chilled to the bone with nervousness, as
they began the ascent of the stairs lead-
Ing to the chapel. The crisis In his life,
he felt, was near at hand.
Under the stealthy hand of Quinnox the
panel opened and they listened intently
for some moments. There was no one In
the dimly lighted chapel, and they made
their way to the door at the opposite end.
The great organ looked down upon them
and Lorry expected every. Instant to hear
It burst . forth in sounds of thunder. It
aeemed alive and watching their move
ments reproachfully. Before unlocking
the door, the captain pointed to a lance
which stood against the wall near by.
"You are to carry that lance," he said,
briefly. Then he cautiously peered forth.
A moment later they were in the broad
hall, boldly striding toward the distant
stairway. Lorry had been Instructed to
proceed without the least sign of timidity.
They passed several attendants in the hall
and heard Count Halfont's voice in con
versation with some one in an anteroom.
As they neared the broad steps who
should come tripping down but Harry An
guish? He saluted Quinnox and walked
rapidly down the corridor, evidently tak
ing his departure after a call on the
Countess.
â¢ "There goes your hostage," said the
captain, grimly. It had required all of
Lorry's self-possession to restrain the cry
of joyful recognition. Up the staircase
they went, meeting several ladies and gen
tlemen coming down, and were soon be
fore the apartments of the Princess. A
tall guard stood In front of the boudoir
door.
"This is your relief, Bassot. You may
go," said Quinnox, and. with a careless
glance at the strange soldier, the sick man
trudged off down the hall, glad to seek his
bed.
. "Is she there?" whispered Lorry, dizzy
and faint with expectancy. \
"Yes. This may mean your death and
mine, sir, but you would do It Win you
explain to her how I came to play her
false?"
"She shall know the truth, good friend."
"After I have gone twenty paces down
the hall, do you rap on the door. Sho
may not admit you at first, but do not
give ' up. If she bid you enter or asks
your mission, enter quickly and close the
door. It is unlocked. She may swoon or
scream, and you must prevent either If
possible. In an hour I shall return and
you must go back to the passage."
"Never! I have come to save her and
her country, and I Intend to do so by
surrendering myself this very night."
"I had hoped to dissuade you. But. sir,
you cannot do so to-night. You forget
that this visit compromises her.'
"True. I had forgotten. Well. I'll go
back with you, but to-morrow I am your
prlosner, not your friend."
"Be careful." cautioned the captain as
he moved away. Lorry feverishly tapped
â¢his knuckles on the panel of the door and
waited with motionless heart for the re
sponse. It came not and he rapped
harder, a strange fear darting into his
mind.
"Well?" came from within, the voice he
adored.
Impetuous haste marked his next move
ment. He dashed open the door, sprarg
inside and closed it quickly. She was sit
ting before her escritoire, writing, and
looked' up, surprised and annoyed.
"I was not to be disturbedâ Oh, God!"
She staggered to her feet and was In
his arms before the breath of her ex
clamation had died away. Had he not
supported her she would have dropped
to the floor. . Her hands, her face were
like ice, her breast was pulseless aÂ»\d
there was the wildest terror in her -"vs.
"My darling â my queen!" he cried, pas
sionately. "At last I am with you! Don't
look at me like that! It is .really Iâ X
could not stay awayâ I could not permit
this sacrifice of yours. Speak to me! Do
not stare like that!"
Her- wide blue eyes slowly swept his
face, piteous wonder and doubt strug
gling in their depths.
"Am I awake?" she murmured, touch
ing his face with her bewildered, ques
tioning hands. "Is it truly you?" A
smile illumined' her face, but her joy was
short lived. An expression cf terror came
to her eyes and there was agony in ths
fingers that clasped his arm. "Why do
you come here?" she cried. "It is mad
ness! How and why came you to tiiU
room?"
He laughed like a delighted boy anct
hastily narrated the events of the past
twenty-four hours, ending with the trial:
that, gave him entrance to her room.
"And all this to see me?" she whispered.
"Td see you and to save you. I hear that
Gabriel has been annoying you and that
you are to give up half of the kingdom
to-morrow. Tell me everything. It iÂ»
another reason for my coming."
Sitting beside him on the divan, she
told of Gabriel's visit and hla dis
missal, the outlook for the next day,
and then sought to convince hira
of the happiness it afforded her to pro
tect him from 'an undeserved death. He
obtained fur Quinnox the royal pardon
and lauded him to the skies. So ravishing
were the moments, so ecstatic the sensa
tions that possessed them that neither
thought of the consequences if he were to
be discovered In her room, disguised aa
one of her guardsmen. He forgot the real
import of his reckless visit until she com
manded him to stand erect before her
that she might see what manner of sol
dier he was. With a laugh, he leaped to
his feet and stood before herâ attention!
She leaned back among the cushions and
surveyed him through the glowing, im
passioned eyes, 'which slowly closed as If
to shut out temptation.
"You are a perfect soldier," she said,
her lashes parting ever so slightly.
"No more perfect than you," he cried.
She remembered, with confusion, her own
masquerading;, but it was unkind of him
to remember it. Her allusion to his uni
form turned his thoughts into the channel
through which they had been suYging so
turbulently up to the moment that found
him tapping at her door. He had not told
her of his determination, and the task
grew harder as he saw the sparkle glow
brighter and brighter In her eye.
"You are a brave soldier, then," she
substituted. "It required courage to come
to Edelweiss with hundreds of men ready
to seize you at sightâ a pack of blood
hounds." â¢
"I should have been a miserable coward
to stay up there while you are so bravely
facing disaster alone down here. I came
to help you, as I should."
"But you can- do nothing, dear, and you
only make matters worse by coming to
me. I have fcught so hard to overcome
the desire to be near you; I have strug
gled against myself for days and days,
and I had won the battle when you came
to pull my walls of strength down about
my ears. Look! On my desk is a letter
I was writing to you. No; you shall not
read It! No one shall ever know what it
contains." She darted to the desk,
snatched up the sheets of paper and held
them over the waxed taper. He stood in
the middle of the room, a feeling of In
tense desolation settling down upon him.
How could he lose this woman?
"To-morrow night Quinnox is to take
you from the monastery and conduct' you
to a distant city. It has all been planned.
Your friend, Mr. Anguish, is to meet
you in three days and you are
to hurry to America by way of Athens.
This was a letter to you. In it I
said many things and was trying to write
farewell when you came to this room. Do
you wonder that I was overcome with,
doubt and amazement â yes. and horrox?
Ach, what peril you are in here! Every
minute may bring discovery and that
would mean death to you. You are inno
cent, but nothing could save you. The
proof is too strong. Mlzrox has found a
man who swears he saw you enter Lo
renz's room."
"What a damnable He!" cried Lorry
lightly. "I was not near his room!"
'.'But you can see what means they will
adopt to convict you. You are doomed if
caught, by my soldiers or thelra. I cannot
save you again. You know now that I love
you. I would not give awav half of. the
land . that my forefathers ruled were it
not true. Bolaroz would be glad to grant
ten years of grace should he but have you
In his clutches. And, to see me, you
would run the risk of undoing all that I
have planned, accomplished and suffered
for. Could you not have been content
with that last good-by at the monastery?
It is cruel to both of usâ to me especally
â that we must have the parting over
again." She had gone to the divan and
now dropped limply among the cushions,
resting her head on her hand.
"I was determined to see you," he said.
"They shall not kill me nor are you tÂ«r*.
sacrifice your lather's domain. Worse
than all, I feared that you might yield to
Gabrielâ"
"Ach! You insult me when you say
that! I yielded to Lorenz because X

jÂ» / tary Long has disposed flnal
'ft AÂ» / ly of the Schley case, so far
Â¥y Â¥m as the Navy Department Is
T Y concerned, by acting upon the
findings and conclusions of
the court of inquiry.
He approves the findings of fact and
the opinion of the full court; he approves
the majority opinion where there is a

. the battle of Santiago, and, finally, he ao-
the recommendation that no further

Schley' s counsel of that fact aa a reason
for declining to hear them on that point.

REPRIMAND FOR THE COMMANDER.
Head of War Department Issues a Stinging Rebuke
to the Ranking Officer of the Army.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â A de
termination on the part of
the administration absolute
ly to terminate further dis
cussion of the Sampson-
Schley controversy took
shape In the publication to-day of some
remarkable correspondence that has
passed between Secretary Root and Lieu
tenant General Miles relative to the lat
ter's Interview, published in a Cincinnati
paper, commenting upon the Schley case.
When the interview appeared it attract
ed much attention officially, but after the
lapse of two days without any sign of
official action the conclusion became gen
eral that the interview would be ignored.
Therefore, the publication this afternoon
of the full correspondence on this sub
ject created a sensation in army and
naval circles. It is seldom, that so severe
a reprimand is administered to an officer
of high rank in either service. What the
result will be cannot be foretold, although
it is assumed that General Miles will sub
mit without further, comment
The nearest parallel of this case of re
cent years, excluding - the incidents con
nected with the celebrated beef inquiry,
was that of Rear Admiral Richard
Meade, who upon returning from a^crulse
in Venezuelan waters with the white
squadron, accorded an interview to a
New York newspaper, severely criticizing
the administration for its lack of vigor
in dealing with the Venezuelan question.
The outcome of that case was the early
retirement of the rear admiral from ac
tive service.
That General Miles appreciates the situ
ation Is shown by the deep concern he
â* ; A3S T "FBAN CISCO, SUNDAY, DECEMBER *J2, 1 yOl-FORTY-FOUll PAG ES.
manifested to-day and his frequent visits
to the office of. Secretary Root. It was
necessary for him to write two letters
to meet the demands of the department
and even then there was no expression of
satisfaction, on the Secretary's part at
the second explanation. However, Secre
tary Root himself regards the incident as
closed. At least, he does not purpose to
take any further action unless obliged to
GO SO.
The text of the correspondence^ which
passed between the Secretary of War and
General Miles follows:

IS IT AN EPIDEMIC?
Vital Statistics Show an Alarming
Increase in an Already Prevailing
Disease â Are Any Exempt?
At no time in the history of disease has
there been such an alarming increase in
the number of cases of any particular
malady as In that of kidney and bladder
troubles now preying upon the people of
this country.
To-day we see a relative, a friend or an
acquaintance apparently well, and in a
few days we may be grieved to learn of
their serious illness or sudden death,
caused by that fatal type of kidney
troubleâ Sright's disease.
Kidney trouble often becomes ad-
vanced Into acute stages before the
afflicted is aware of its presence: that is
why we read of so many sudden deaths
of prominent business and professional
men, physicians and others. They have
neglected to stop the leak in time.
While scientists are puzzling their
brains to find out the cause, each indi-
vidual can by a little precaution avoid the
chances of contracting dreaded and dan-
gerous kidney trouble, or eradicate It
completely from their system if already
afflicted. Many precious lives might have
been, and many more can yet be saved,
by paying attention to the kidneys.
It is the mission of The Call to benefit
its readers at every opportunity and
therefore we advise all who have any
symptoms of kidney or bladder trouble to
write to-day to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Bing-
bamton, N. Y., for a free sample bottle
of Swamp-Root, the celebrated specific
which is having such a great demand and
remarkable success in the cure of the
most distressing kidney and bladder
troubles. With the sample bottle of
Swamp-Root will also be sent free a
pamphlet and treatise of valuable infor-
mation.

mand Underground
System.
LONDON, Dec. 21.-The breakdown of
England's telegraphic system, which Is
still in a state of semi-chaos as the re
sult of the recent severe storms, has pro
duced a widespread demand for under
ground wires.
This system is already in use between
London and Birmingham and is being ex
tended northward. The Postofflce au
thorities point to the tremendous expense
\rtiich would be involved in changing
from overhead to underground wires
throughout the United Kingdom, but
those who are agitating for the change
maintain that the loss caused by the re
cent storms would have gone far tov/ard
defraying the outlay which the Postoffice
dreads.
It is estimated that London alone lost
Â£200.000 by the breaking down of tna
telegraph wires, while the railroads
calculate their loss from the same cause
about Â£40,000. Another objection put
forward by the Government Is that
underground wires are slower and harder
to work than overhead vires..
Though the damage was inflicted over
a week ago, telegraphic and telephonic
communication between London and the
provinces Is still incomplete, and in some
instances is not yet restored.

KAISER'S WORDS
AROUSE ARTISTS
All Germany Is Stirred
Up Over Imperial
Criticism.
Half a Million Persons Are
Without Work in
Germany.
BERLIN, Dec. 2Lâ Emperor William's
discourse on art during the dinner which
he gave at the palace on Wednesday even'
ing to painters and sculptors is the prin
cipal topic discussed â¢ in the drawing
rooms and doctorial assemblages here. It
has even got into those socio-political
controversies which occupy so much of
the attention of the educated classes in
Germany, as well as that of the agita
tors in the cafes.
His Majesty's repugnance to natural
ism arises, the defenders of the modern
school aver, solely from his antipathy to
social democracy. The common talk at
court is that artists such as Liebermann
and Uhde, who delight In scenes repre
senting the of the poor, must be so
cialists, fellows without a country. The
political bias of the Emperor's artistic
opinions is the only explanation the crit
ics find for his condemnation of the work
of Boecklin, Liebermann, Stuck, Uhde
and even Menzel, on whom his Majesty
bestowed the Order of the Black Eagle.
None of these were present at the dinner,
but they had defenders among those who
were there. After the ladleq withdrew
Emperor William took the guests to
Heinrich's Hallen, where over beer and
tobacco they discussed the doctrines his
Majesty had laid down in his speech. The
Emperor's good humor emboldened sev
eral of those present to disagree with
him, and they rather plainly intimated
that they believed injustice to some of
the first artistic names in Germany had
been done in saying that their work
brought art down to the gutter. His
Majesty returned argument . for argu
ment, as he loves a fight of any kind, and
he is described as having been particu
larly lively in repartee. The sitting was
prolonged for several hours.
The completion of the thirty-two groups
of statuary in the Sieges Allee, Emperor
William's gift to the nation, is the text of
a number of articles surveying the ar
tistic merit of the series. The general
opinion seems to be that it is of doubtful
value. The whole series is tiresome and
monotonous. The cost, which his Majesty
paid out of his own pocket, exceeds 2,(XK),
000 marks.
This is a gloomy Christmas In Ger
many. A half-million persons are unem
ployed, and the consequent wretchedness
darkens the holidays. Even the well-to
do are most Indifferent. They are unable
to avoid seeing the misery of the cellar
dwellers of Berlin. Reports from everj'
part of the empire Indicate that extraor
dinary demands are being made on the
poor funds and private agencies for the
relief of the destitute. Several new char
itable societies have been organized In
Berlin, and three or four times more than
the usual holiday contributions to the
poor have been distributed, yet the dis
tress seems scarcely diminished.
The municipal councils of Cologne,
Stuttgart, Leipzig, Berlin and other cities
are discussing the question of municipal
aid, without reaching anything very defi
nite. The provincial government of Weis
baden has determined to distribute relief
from the provincial treasury. . .,..â -â :
One amelioration of the situatipn upon
which both trades unions and emploj'ers
agreed is the dismissal of foreign labor
ers, many thousands of . wnom, Czechs.
Poles. Italians and Russians, obtained
work in Germany during the boom period.
The Government approves or the dismissal
of these men and of giving preference to
Germans. The managers of the great
Laura Iron Works in Silesia, in discharg
ing 800 foreign workmen, said the authori
ties had advised taking this step. Other
large establishments have taken the same
course and the ducal Government of An
halt has discharged and expelled from
the duchy all foreign laborers in the Gov
ernment establishments. Expulsions of
foreigners by the local authorities have
occurred in other parts of Germany.
The census of the unemployed in Ber
lin shows that 59.593 persons are out of
work here. The Socialists,- in interpellat
ing the municipal government on the
subject this week, said the number would
be 80,000 after the Christmas work was
over. ' The burgomaster said he believed
this estimate was excessive.

The decision of the isthmian commission was

After an uproarious session the share
holders almost unanimously voted to
adopt the proposition set forth in the re
port, empowering the board to conclude
the sale and concession to the United
States of all the Panama Canal Com
pany's properties, subject to the limita
tions specified above.
"Get the United States to buy the canal
at any price, in order to save some of our
money," seemed to be the prevalent feel
ing and gist of the speeches of the share
holders. About 250 shareholders were
present, Including a number of ladies. In
the absence of M. Hutin a shareholder
presided. A storm broke- immediately
after the report had been reached. The
shareholders were greatly excited by the
news that M. Hutin had resigned and de
manded explanations of what had oc
curred at the meeting of the board at
which he had resigned. The chairman's
delay in. replying to questions led to
vituperations which were launched at the
heads of. the directors by several share
holders, whose modest attitude indicated
that they had been severe sufferers on ac
count of the Panama failure.
Eventually the proceedings degenerated
into such a tumult that policemen were
summoned to expel one of the noisiest
shareholders, who approached the direc
tors* table, thumped it with hip fist, yelled
at the top of his voice and shook a hand
ful of papers in the face of the chair
man. ' â  'â  ' A . 'â  'â¢
Why Hutin Resigned.
The intrusion of the policemen raised
such pandemonium that they felt com
pelled to withdraw, and the delinquent
subsided.
The few speakers who secured a hear
ing urged the adoption of the board's
proposals, as being the shareholders' only
salvation.
One speaker said It was palpably im
possible for the company to finish the
canal, as it could not raise money any
where In France or in the rest of Eu
rope. He added that a large shareholder,
M. Bunau-Varilla, who had published an
appeal to the shareholders, and others -at
the beginning of the year to contribute
funds to carry on the work, secured prom
ises of -only 200,000 francs.
Other speakers appealed to them to
cease the tumult, as the moment was de
cisive in regard to the fate of their mil
lions.
; Finally the chairman rose- and made a
statement which soothed his hearers.; Ho
said there was no contradiction in -the
resignation of Hutin and the expressions
of appreciation of his labors contained, in
his report. The board :hacL- considered the.
situation resulting from'. 'the Isthmian
Commissioners'- decision, - and . had come
to the conclusion that a change of policy
was needed. . . : " .â ,. . â¢
They therefore made the \ proposition
contained In the >eport; : but as it .was
thought that the negotiations with the
United States might run smoother with
out M. Hutin,, the latter, resigned. The
meeting, appeased by this explanation,
then approved of the .prppoj itlcn made In
the report. .'. . , â¢ .

terrible blow against President Castro,
who Immediately upon learning of the.up

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUENOS ATRES, Dec. 21.â The Argen
tine'Government has wired to its Min
ister in Chile, Senor Portela, authorizing
him to leave Santiago. This announce
ment has just, been made as a result of
the failure of Minister -Pbrtela and the
Chilean Secretary of Foreign' Affairs to
reach an agreement on the points at .a
sue between the two republics. The Ar
gentine Cabinet had a- 1 meeting to-day.
After it had ended the Minister of For
eign "Affairs, Senor Alcorta, said that
Minister Portela had been directed to
leave Santiago, if Chile did not accept Ar
gentina's proposal for a settlement of'tho
controversy. This statement made, it
seems very probable that Minister Por
tela would be recalled. â¢
. The withdrawal of the Argentine Min
ister will not provoke war immediately,
but it does increase the gravity of the sit
uation. There is a belief that the whole
matter may be referred to King Edward
of Great Britain, who Is. arbitrator of the
boundary dispute, with an explanatory
note.
Military preparations are being pushed
in this country and also in Chile.

these will be finished by the end of Janu

"HEADQUARTERS. OF THE ARMY,
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 21, 19D1.-The
Honorable the Secretary of War â Sir:
Referring to my note of yesterday, and In
order that there may be no misunder
standing, I desire to say that for several
years a distinguished and gallant officer
has been assailed by parties who have en
deavored .to write him and other high offi
cials down, until finally he appealed
agiiinst such assaults to a co-ordinate
branch of the Government. That co
ordinate branch of the Government grant
ed him a court of inquiry, and, as I un
derstand It, they unanimously exonerated
him from such epithets as coward, poi
trcon.etc, and their opinions were given
to the public for the information of all
citizens. When I siid that I had no sym
pathy with those who had endeavored to
destroy the reputation of a high officer
who, like all other officers, regards his
honor more sacred than life I had in mind
ami . referred . to those assaults against
which the admiral appealed for protection
and justiUcatlon and certainly "not to -a
co-ordinate branch of the Government.
"I request that this note be laid before
the President and have no objection to it
being made public. Very' respectfully,

I'Ydur explanation of the public state
ment made by you is not satisfactory.
You are in error if you say that you have
the same right as any other citizen to ex
press publicly an opinion regarding the
questions pending in the course of mili
tary discipline. The established invariable
rules of official propriety necessary to the
effective discipline of the service impose
limitations upon the public, expression of
military officers, with whichVour long ex
perience should have made you familiar.
Your duty is to express ydur opinion on
official matters when called upon by your
official superiors or In the due course of
your official reports and recommenda
tions, and not otherwise.
"The first article of the regulations gov
erning the army of the United States pro
vides :
. " 'Deliberations or discussions among
military men conveying praise or censure
or any mark of approbation toward oth
ers In the military service are prohib
ited.'
"This provision has been a part of the
army regulations for at least a half-cen
tury, nnd the highest obligation to ob
serve It rests upon the officers whose high
rank should make them examples to their
subordinates. Any other rule of action in
the military service would be subversive
of discipline. It would not be tolerated In
a subaltern, and it will not be tolerated
in any officer of whatever rank.
Justly Idable to Censure. '
"The present facts are that for several
years there has been unfortunate and bit
ter controversy in the Navy Departmentâ
a controversy generally deplored, even by
the participants, as tending to bring the
service Into disesteem at home and
abroad nnd to destroy those relations of
mutual confidence and friendship between
naval officers which the interests of ef
fective service require. In this . contro
versy the army has not been Involved,
ard no bar has been raised to that good
feeling and friendly relation between all
the officers of the navy and all the offi
cers of the army which is essential to the
successful /and harmonious co-operation
of the two services in preparation for and
in action. A court of inquiry has been
held on the matters in controversy and a
repcrt had been made in which one mem
ber of the court had dissented -in some
particulars from the majority, and the
report was pending before the reviewing
authority. At thia point the lieutenant
general of the army saw fit to make a
public expression of his opinion as be
tween the majority and the minority of
the court, accompanied by a criticism of
a most severe character, which could not
fail to be applied by the generality of
readers to the naval officers against
whose view your opinion- was expressed.
It is of no consequence on whose side
your, opinion was, or what it was. Vou
had no business in the controversy and
no right, holding the office which you did,
lo express any opinion. Your conduct
was in violation of the regulation above
cited and the rules of official propriety,
and you are justly liable to censure,
which I now express. Very respectfully,
"ELIHU ROOT,
"Secretary bf War.
"Lieutenant General Nel3on A. Miles.

Docs Not Change Case.
"P. S.â Your second letter of explana
tion, dated to-day and received since the
above was written, does not change the
case. The necessity for repeated expla
nations but illustrates the importance of
the rule which you have violated.

The fact that simultaneously with tbo
publication of the Miles correspondence
Secretary Root gave out a copy of Secre
tary Long's letter directing that Maclay's
resignation be requested, taken in con
nection with the publication this morning
of the final chapters of the Schley con
troversy, so far as it has figured before
the Navy Department, is taken as an in

clear the official records of all pending is

Howard Struble, who worked in the
Union Pacific shops, is the father of the
little ones'. A few weeks ago he disap
peared" from -home. Before the coiil
weather set in . the mother was able to
support the children although she is un
used to hard work. When it became
necessary to buy coal she was obliged to
write to her parents in. Ohio and they of
fered to care for the children on their
farm.
As the old people were poor they were
unable to send money for carfare and
Mrs. Struble â¢was forced to appeal to the
County Commissioners. The board prom
ised to pay all the fare the law allowedâ
all but $5 and this sum the mother man
aged to borrow. She was heartbroken
over the parting, but felt that it would be
setter than that the babies should suffer.
Lqraine Struble is small and in his first
trousers. When members of the Board
of Commissioners asked him if he were
afraid to go alone so far from his motht.r
he shook his head. "I know the wa'y to
grandma's house when you get off the
cars," he said. "We play at going back
to grandma's every, day." He explained
how lonesome it has ijcen while h. : s
mother is at 'work and what a good time
ho had last summer on the' farm;
The baby is still in long clothes, but the
children were put in charge of the con
ductor, who promised .to be a father t.o
them. Loral ne was given a dollar to pay

LOSES A WIFE
FOR HIS JOKE
Nebraska Man's Humor
the Cause of Mari
tal Disaster.
Special Discatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 21.â A . practical
joke has cost John S. Wetledge his wife.
Mrs. Bertha Weiledge has been granted a
divorce in Judge Estelle"s court on thÂ»
ground of cruelty. The young wife has
been caused much anguish and distress of
mind, the 'petition pointed out, tnrough
a practical joke perpetrated by the plain
tiff, who pretended that he had committed
suicide. >>,
The Weiledges were married in Rood
house, HI., in 1SDS, changing their resi
dence to Omaha one year ago. Mrs. Weil
edge says that they quarreled frequently,
but that no occurrence or any Importance
transpired until one month ago. The dis
agreement had j bqpn more violent than
usual and when it was at its height Weil
edge exclaimed that he would put an end
to his troubles.. "for^ once and for all.','
He seized his revolver and . rushed into
an adjoining room, slamming the door and
locking it. Mrs. Weiledge heard the re
port of a pistol and the tailing of a heavy
body to the floor.
The frenzied wife hastened for an ax
and broke the lock of the door. She
found her husband lying on the bed in an
abandonment of mirth over the success
of the jest. An overturned sofa- testified
as to the identity of the falling body.
Weiledge explained between I bursts jf
laughter that. he had taken this surpris
ing means of teaching his wife to appre
ciate him. Mrs. Weiledge responded by
going into hysterics from which she wuÂ«
with difficulty relieved. She failed to se-j
any humor In the incident and. sought a
divorced / 'â  ' / .
Judge Estelle said he thought the hus
band's /conduct such as to unfit him for
the possession of a wife. He gave the
plaintiff a'decree and alimony. .

PRESIDENT SAYS
IT'S RIDICULOUS
Ruraor in Washington
That Roosevelt Was
. Attacked.
Mystery Surrounds the Affair
and Officials Make
Denial.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, 1 BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â Two stories
have been circulated all day which picture
President Roosevelt in a street incident,
either with a crank or an intoxicated
man. Just what happened has not yejt
been explained," ." for neither the White
House officials nor the President's friends
will say anything about the affair. It is
still a mystery and bids fair to go down
in history as such.
One story is to the effect that while
the. President was out for his daily walk
early Thursday evening he was accosted
by a crank, who went so far as to roughly
seize the President by the shoulder. This
story has it that Mr. Roosevelt promptly
drew off and knocked the man down. It
is also reported that the President was
walking at the time with Lord Paunce
fote, the British Embassador. This, how
ever, is flatly and officially denied. What
ever the incident was Lord Pauncefnt*
may have seen it at a distance, but he
certainly was not the President's com
panion during the walk.
The other story runs 'to the effect that
while the President waa walking with
Commander Cowles and Senator Lodge he
was jostled by an intoxicated man, who
aimed a blow and was qulokly brushed
aside. When thÂ© President was asked by
one. of his friends to-day if he had been
attacked on the street he said: "Nothing
of the kind. The story is absolutely ri
diculous." And he quickly dropped the
subject. One of the officials at the White
House to-day stated that there was noth
ing whatever to give color to false re
ports, which were rather sensational. The
story accepted as most plausible to-night
is' that a badly intoxicated man came near
running into the President and that the
latter stepped aside to avoid a collision.
But why the incident snould be sur
rounded by so much mystery has not yet
been explained.
LAWYER SCORES
DOWIE METHODS
Chicago Zionite Is De-
nounced in Receiver
ship Suit.
CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â "Dr." John Alex
ander .TJowle'a business methods were
severely criticized by Attorney Reeves in
Judge Tuley's court to-day, when the
closing argument in the suit for a receiv
ership for the Zion lace industries was
begun.
His business rule was likened unto that
of a King who tells his underlings what
he wants done and then demands of them
a hearty approval. His control over his
associates was typified as a club hovering
over one's head, ci â¢'
Attorney Reeves entered a plea for all
the small investors in the Zion lace in
dustries, and said the court should â  not
consider that the interests of Samuel
Stevenson â Dowie's brother-in-law and
legal adviserâ and of Dowie were the only
equities at stake, but should remember
all the numerous small stockholders in
the concern, many of whom had invested
their all in the institution.
The attorney drew a picture of how
Dowle had discovered Stevenson in Eng
land, a prosperous merchant of a religious
turn of mind, and how by some subtle in
fluence had . induced him to part with
everything to embark with him here in
business. Attorney Packard, for Dowie,
announced to the court that Stevenson
probably could get $50,000 of the amount
he claimed from Dowie if he would make
a. demand for a return of cash for the
shares Mrs. Stevenson held in the institu
tion at the time of her death.
France Wants Our "Hustle" Spirit.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21. â The committee
appointed* by M. Millerand, the French
Minister of Commerce, to study the or
ganization and operation of trusts and to
look into the founding in this country of
an industrial school for young French
men,-arrived to-day on the La Savoie.
Lazare Weillcr, a copper manufacturer,
and M. de la Gotellerie, an engineer, con
stitute the committee.
"We are going to send our students."
said M. Weiller, "where they can learn to
be French-Americans; where they can ab
sorb knowledge and also character; the

RAILWAY SECRET
Great Northern Presi
dent Tells About
Combinations.
Denial Is MadÂ© of the Stories
About a Great
Merger.
ST. PAUL. Dec. a.-Presldent J. J.
Hill of the Great Northern Railway and
cf the recently organized Northern Secu
rities Company this afternoon gave out
the following statement:
I fcave been absent from Minnesota more than
two months and during that time there has
~^.rlsen a wide discussion throughout thÂ« State
(>f what has been generally called a consolida
tion or a merger of the Northern Pacllio and
Great Northern railways. In this discussion
etatemeats have been made which are *>o widely
dlEerent from the facts that I feel called upon
to make a statement oÂ£ Just what has beea
done la the past and what will bo done In tat
lumre.
â When the Northern Pacific failed and the
bankine-house or J. P. ilorsan & Co. reor
ganized It, myself and friends were holders
of a iaixe amount of tiiat company's security.
After the reorganization was completed ws
bought about twenty-six millions of Northern
Pacific etock, both common and preferred.
Some of this 6tock wag atterward sold, but a
large amount has L-een held from that time
to the present. About a year ago the Union
Paciflc Company bought the Huntlngton and
other Interests in the Northern Paclllc and at
the eaaie time made an effort to get tho con
trol of the Chicago, Burlington and Qulncy.
With these lines in the hands of the Union
Pacific Interests both the Northern Pacific aad
Great Northern would be shut out of Nebraska.
Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota. Iowa, Illinois
and Wisconsin, except by using other lines of
railway, some of which were In the market
tor sale and might at any tlmÂ« pass under
the control or be combined with the Union
Pacific interests. We then, with the Northern
Paciflc. made proposals to the directors of the
Burlington to buy their entire property. When
thli transaction was about being closed tho
people who represented the Union Pacific Com
pany and who had previously tried to buy the
Burlington, asked to be allowed to share with
us In the purchase of that company; this pro
posal we refused for the reason that It would
defeat our object In buying - the Burlington.
end further It was &sralnst the law of several
of the States in which the longest mileage of
ihe Burlington was located.
r Big Purchases of Stock.
At that time, axsinst the opposition of the
more southern lines, both the Northern Pacino
and Great Northern had put Into effect a low
colonization rate and were carrying dally thou
6ands of people into the Northwest, many of
whom were coming from Kansas and Nebraska
along the lines of the Union Pacific. This
movement was at Its height In the month of
April, and after we had closed the purchase of
the Burlington the Union Paciflc people un
dertook the boldest effort that ever was made
In this country and bought over sixty millions
of the stock of the Northern Pacific In the mar
kets of Europe acd the United States. I was
In Xew York at the time and after Morgan &
Co. were aware of the action of the Union
Pacific people It was found that together we
held about twenty-six millions of Northern Pa
cific common stock. Inasmuch as the common
etock. by right of a contract made with the
preferred stockholders when the company was
organized and the etock Issued, had the priv
ilege of paying off the preferred stock at par
on the 1st day of January of any year until
1917, Morgan & Co. then bought In London and
New York about sixteen millions of the com
mon stock of the Northern Paciflc At the
samÂ« time the Union Pacific Interests, having
already so large an Investment, bid the stock
up until there was the largest stock corner ever
known. The common Etock In three or four
cay E went up to $1000 per Ehare,
I erulalned to my friends how that, with
control of the Northern Pacific, the Union
Pacific would control the entire ICorthwest and
the West from Mexico to the Canadian line,
except for the Great Northern. So great was
the effort to get this control that one of my
friMics in London who owned two millions of
Northern Pacific common was offered and re
fused fourteen million dollars for his stock.
The reer:H was that Morgan & Co. and our
felves owr.e3 forty-two out of eighty millions
cf the Northern Pacific common, with the priv
ilege of paying off the seventy-five millions of
Northern Paciflc Dreferred.
The Union Pacific people owned thirty-seven
millions of the common and about forty- two
minions of the preferred, which was a c'Â«ar
majority of fill the etock of the Northern Pa
cific, end claimed the exclusive control of the
Northern Pacific ond through that ownership
of half of the Burlington. When It . was
known that these preferred chares could and
would be paid off and before the annual elec
tion mutual negotiations resulted In Mr. Mor
pan givinsr them a representative In the
Northern Pacific board. At the Fame time I
was electod a member nf the Northern Pacific
board. When I was advised of my election I
notified them that I could not. !Â«>s:aily act as a
director cf the Northern Pacific and Great
rCorthern ct the racie time, and I resigned
after the first meeting cf the board.
Reason for the Combine.
Several of thÂ« gentlemen who have long
been Interested In the Great Northern Rail
way and Its predecessor have desired to com
bine their Individual holdings In corporate
form, and in that way secure a permanent pro
tection for their Interests ana a continuation
of the policy and management which has
Sone so much for the development of the
Northwest. Out of this desire has grown the
Northern Securities Ctompany. It became nec
essary (In order to prevent the Northern Pa
;19c from passing under the control of T*nfon
Pacific int^repts and with It the Joint control
Of the Brrlinrton) to pay off these twenty
five millions of Northern Pacific preferred,
rhe enormous amount cf cash required for
(his purpose from a comparatively Fmall rum
oer of men made It necessary for them to act
:ogether In a large and permanent manner
through the medium of a corporation, and the
Korthprn Securities Company accorded them
:he means cf accomplishing this object wlth
sut the necessity of creating a new company
to finance the operations for the Northern Pa
rifie. Trh-e at the Fame time the credit of
:he Northern Securities Company would be
much eircnger. as It would also hnld ft con-
ADVZRTISEJSIENTS.
That's the personal question a woman
asks herself when 6he reads of the cures
A of womanly diseases by the use of Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription.
Why shouldn't it cure her?
Is it a complicated case? Thousands
of such cases have been cured by "Fa-
vorite Prescription." Is it a condition
which local doctors have declared in-
curable? Among the hundreds of thou-
sands of sick women cured by the use of
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription there
are a great many who were pronounced
incurable by local doctors. Wonders
have been worked by Â« Favorite Pre-
scription" in the cure of irregularity,
weakening drains, inflammation, ulcera-
tion and female weakness. It always
helps. It almost always cures.

Eecurities.
The Northern Securities Company Is or
ganized to deal in high-class securities, to hold
the same for the benefit of Its shareholders and
to advance the interests of the incorporations
whose securities it owns. Its powers do not
Include the or>eratlon of railway, banking,
mining nor the buying or selling of securities
or properties for others on commission. It is
purely an investment company and the ob
ject of its creation was simply to enable those
who hold Its stock to continue their respective
Interests In association tosether and to pre
vent such interests from being scattered by
death or otherwise; to provide against such at
tacks as have been made upon the Northern
Pacilic by a rival and competing interests
whose main investment was hundreds of miles
from the Northwest and whose only object In
buying control of the Northern Paciflc waa to
benefit their southern properties by restraining
the growth of the country between Lake Su
perior and Puget Sound.
The foregoing Is a brief and absolutely cor
rect statement of the whole subject, and Its
truth can easily be verified by the State of
Minnesota and any other State or person hav
ing sufficient Interest to Investigate the facts,
which are all matters of record.
Hill Asks Some Questions.
Now. as to the effect of what has been done
upon the public Interests, let me ask a few
questions, which I want every candid and hon
est man to answer for himself:
Did the Union Paciflc people with their rail
way lines extending from Omaha and New
Orleans to California and Oregon, through the
several States in the Middle West and South,
purchase a majority of the stock of the North
ern Paciflc Company for the purpose of aiding
that company and Increasing the growth and
prosperity cf the northern country, or was it
for the purpose of restricting such growth and
aiding the nevelocment of their enormous In
terests hundreds of miles to the south?
In defeating their control of the Northern
Paciflc and retaining it In the hands of those
who had built it up and with It the entire
Northwest, did we injure or benefit the people
of the Northwest?
Did I, by inducing my friends to hold their
Northern Paciflc common stock and act Jointly
with Morgan & Co. when this stock was selling
at $500 and $1000 a share, thus preventing the
Union Pacific from controlling the Northwest,
Injure or benefit every interest, agriculture,
business and otherwise, of the entire country
between Lake Superior and the Pacific Ocean?
Had we sold our 20.000.0CO of Northern Pa
cific even at $300 a share amounting to $60,
000.000. or nearly $40,000,000 more than Us
present value, and transferred to the Union
Paciflc the country between Canada and Mex
ico, what law of Minnesota would we have
violated? Could we not legally have put the
money In our pockets and let the country
learn what it was to be dominated by a parallel
and competing railroad?
The public is interested In having a good
railway service and fair and reasonable rates.
The past is gone and speaks for Itself; I can
speak for the future and have no hesitation
whatever in saying that the increased volume
of traffic, both through and local, will enable
the companies to reduce their rates In propor
tion to the volume of sucb traffic and that In
the near future the publlo will have a chance
to see for Itself this feature of what I have
said. The 4evelopment of the country will
Increase with greater increase In population
between Minnesota and the Paciflc. No mer
ger or consolidation of the Northern Paciflc
and the Great Northern Is contemplated. Each
company will bÂ« operated separately In the
future as in thÂ» nast. . . * -â¢. '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1901.
WOMAN MISSING;
MURDER FEARED
Vancouver Police Find
No Trace of Mrs.
Powell.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 21,-Mrs.
Grace Powell, a young and pretty German
woman of this city, has. been missing
since Thursday afternoon, and it is feared
she -has been murdered. An hour before
dusk she stepped from her house for a
moment and since that time not the
slightest trace of her has been found.
While no arrests have been made, the po
lice are watching for Oscar Lazgar, a
half demented man who for months has
been annoying Mrs. Powell with his at
tentions. They suspect that he is guilty
of either her abduction or her murder.
According to the story told by Mrs.
Powell's sister, who was present when
the woman left the house, a man had
come to the door to sell chickens. She
heard Mrs. Powell and the man making
a bargain for two fowls and Mrs. Powell
came in for her purse, which contained
between $50 and $G0. With a word. of ad
monition to the sister not to allow the
fire to slacken Mrs. Powell went out with
the man, as he said he had the fowl a
short distance up the street. The side
walk outside was narrow for some dis
tance and on both sides were bushes. Mrs.
Powell did not return, and although the
police and neighbors have searched the
district thoroughly no trace of the woman
has been found.
Lazgar was seen In the vicinity the day
before and it was known that Mrs. Powell
was afraid of him. They had been lovers
in Germany before Mrs. Powell married.
Since his arrival in this country Laz
gar has spent most of his time In an asy
lum. He threatened to kill Mayor Town
ley of this city because the latter would
not give him money. Recently he' de
manded $50 from Mrs. Powell, on condition
that. he would go away and cease annoy
ing her. The police believe that the mad
man sent the supposed poultry dealer to
the house and having enticed Mrs. Powell
away either killed her or carried her off.
No poultry seller called that day at other
houses in the vicitity. .

WASHINGTON, Dec 21.-Word was re

At the Naval Hospital it was stated late
to-night that Captain Cook's condition
was much improved. His ailment Is an

MAKES CHARGES â¢
OF CONSPIRACY
Mining Company in Mon
tana Accuses Well-
Known Men.
BUTTE, Mont.. Dec; 21.â The Parrot
Mining . Company charges F. Augustus
Helnze, the M. O. P. Company, John Mac-
Ginnisa and Daniel Lamm with being in
a conspiracy, the alleged object of which
is to get a receiver appointed for the Par
rot Company through' false representa
tions in order that they may wreck the
property and steal its wealth of ore from
the stockholders of the company.
The charges are made in an answer
filed in court to-day by che Parrot Com
pany to the suit recently brought by Mac-
G.nniss and Lamm to have the Amal
gamated Copper - Company declared a
trust and to have a receiver appointed
for the Parrot because its directors and
officers turned the company over to the
Amalgamated. It was charged by Mac-
Ginniss that the Amalgamated was using
the earnings .of .the Parrot to pay divi
dends on the stock of other concerns, and
that generally the company was misman
aged.
The Parrot Company declares that since
the Amalgamated acquired a majority of
its stock in 1898 the dividends paid have
more than doubled. It is shown that the
company paid its first dividend in 1S97.
when It amounted to $102,857, or about 4^
per cent on its capital of 250,000 shares.
In 1893 it paid $413,730, or 18 per cent; in
1899 it paid $896,415. or 39 per cent, and In
1900 it paid $1,379,160, or 60 per cent. The
par value of the stock is $10, but in 1898
it sold for $18 and in the present year it
sold for $45 and $50. It is charged that
the intention of MacGinniss is to get a
receiver who is friendly to - the- Helnze
Interests and to work the mines in the
interest of Heinze, . . v:"

CRAVING FOR SYMPHONIES
ALLAYS DOUBTS CONCERNING
THE CITY'S MUSICAL FUTURE
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
JOSEF HOFMANX. THE GREAT PIANIST, WHOSE EARLY APPEAR
ANCE IX THIS CITY WILL BE WELCOME NEWS TO MUSIC LOV-.
ERS OF SAX FRANCISCO.
PERHAPS the most hopeful local
happening of all the musical year,
not even excepting the Grau grand
opera season, was the symphony
concert of last week. The new
lesder and his men were greeted by
a surprisingly large house, in face of
almost every discouraging likelihood
against Itâ Christmas holiday shopping,
the financial shortage Incident upon the
grand opera season, the afternoon per
formance and the like. But the affair sat
isfactorily proved, among other things,
that the people are symphony hungry, and
when a city Is hungry for symphonies
there Is little to fear for its musical fu
ture.
The next concert, of Friday afternoon,
January 10, will doubtless attract a much
larger audience, but the. Symphony Soci
ety has every reason to be gratified with
the success of its first venture. Almost all
of the leading musicians turned up at the
concert, as well as the numerous ama
teurs of distinction that the town boasts,
and from a succes de curlosite the affair
became a genuine sucess d'estixne as the
good work of leader and orchestra made
iteelf felt Also, the strength of the fash
ionable contingent was distinctly encour
aging and makes it reasonable to indulge
tljÂ«? hope that the order of things that pre
vails in Boston symphony circles may be
come the rule here. A Boston society wo
man regards her seats at the symphony
concerts as the first necessity of social dis
tinction, just as the Xew York woman
lcoka upon her box at the Metropolitan
Opera House as the inevitable, If agree
able, tax on her social position. This hap
pens to be the best thing under present
conditions, unfortunately, for society pays
the piper, while the rest of us get the
benefit. Only so, under the present re
gime, can good music be given, but in
gome future day of sanity, when it Is rec
ognized as being as vitally .essential to a
rounded and harmonious life as the mat
utinal bath, music will be as much a mu
nicipal care as the city water system, as
beneficently and as widely useful. Mean
time, we must be grateful to Maecenas, or
rather to Madame Maecenas, who
shoulders most of the art patronage of
the day, and hope ehe will continue to re
gard the San Francisco Symphony Soci
ety as her best opportunity for usefulness
to the good, the true and the beautiful. It
Is the best that we have here at least and
worthy of all support.
Naturally enough the chief Interest of
the symphony concert centered In the new
leader, Paul Stelndorff. As every one
knows, Mr. Steindortf is the conductor of
the Tivoli orchestra, and the fourth Tivoli

conductor to essay symphony concerts,
Adolph Bauer, Gustave Hlnrlchs and Max
Hlrschfeld being the preceding ones. Mr.
Steindorff's excellent work during the
grand opera season " Insured a strong in
terest In his symphony effort, and the'ex
pectations aroused thereby were much
more than realized. The composition of
the orchestra, to begin with, shows the
new leader to be possessed of uncommon
skill in handling men. He has the best
orchestral material in town, lacking only
a few musicians of. note, who will doubt
less be gathered in later, and has fitted
each man to his place with an ingenuity
that speaks volumes for his capacity as a
leader. \ â¢ . . .
As a conductor Mr. Stelndorff shows an
eminent dignity, grasp and poise, as well
as delicacy and. refinement. . Inevitably it
was a somewhat more rigid effort than
his operatic work, plasticity being one of
the last qualities obtainable in orchestral
achievement, but its lack of freedom was
fully compensated for by the solidity,
smoothness and correctness of | the inter
pretations. The other things will come
later, the finer nuance, ease, abandon,
elasticity, climacteric power with rhyth
mic witchery that yield themselves only
to long and faithful wooing, but an essen
tially right beginning has been made.
There is every reason to be gratified with
the start in life of the new orchestra and
every reason for confidence in its leader.
The orchestra contains flfty-five mem
bers, distributed as follows: Ten first vio
lins, eight second violins, six violas, five
violoncellos and seven double basses in the
strings. The wood wind has three flutes,
two oboes, two clarionettes and two bas
soons and the brass four horns, two trum
pets, three trombones and a bass tuba.
T'ic bass, snare and kettledrums and cym
bals complete the list.
Among the plas'ers are to be found such
names as Giulio Minetti (concertmelster),

to be up and doing.

The California Conservatory: gave one
of its always interesting recitals on Tues
day evening last at Sherman & Clay Hall

executants. The work' throughout -was
thoroughly intelligent, capable and sin
cere, and in some instances more than
that. Miss Josie Coonan shows a strong
musical instinct, and her rendering of the
Hummel number was full of color, sym
pathy and judgment, as well as technical
sureness. MIes Lily Hansen in^a Chopin
"Ballade" (No. 2) showed herself pos

Woolf is well equipped -technically, and
temperamentally, as her "Rigoletto Fan

quickness in recovering herself after a
lapse of memory In her Beethoven num
ber showed an unusual presence of mind,
has a clean, sure touch and good style of
the bravura order. She frequently per
mits her accompaniment In the bass to
overbalance the upper melodies. Miss

rondo for two pianos with taste, and the
Misses Tolclas and Hansen gave with sym

BARBARISM AT ALTURAS.
GROSS as were the outrages committed against California law by the Modoc lynchers,
they wejre not more offensive to justice or to the dignity of law than are those which
have been of well nigh daily occurrence in the court at Alturas, where the alleged
offenders have been brought to trial for the crime. It is high time those rowdy wrang
lings and scenes of violence in the court be. brought under the condemnation of public opinion.
It is not by such methods as those which have thus iar prevailed in the trial that law can be en
forced or justice vindicated. . ' â¢
Day after day the reports of the proceedings of the trial reveal some new source of con
fusion and lawlessness that verges upon barbarism. ; Insults are bandied back and forth among
witnesses, lawyers and the Judge himself. At one time a witness sprang from his seat and made
a bodily* attack upon the attorney conducting the cross-examination. At another time the Judge
from the bench charged that the attorneys for the defense desire his< assassination;, and when
one of them declared he had never tried to assassinate any human being, the Judge in substance
retorted that he had. *
All these charges and counter charges are made with bitterness and vindictiveness. They
fill the court with turmoil, and the spectators watch the trial more as if it were a wrangle that
might lead at any moment to a fight than as a solemn hearing of evidence and law in a case in
which the life of a man is at stake. The Judge at times makes an effort- to enforce respect for
his court, but he makes it in a manner that increases the disrespect and augments the violence of
the attorneys to whom his threats are addressed. In short the scene is anything but one of dig
nity, or even of decency. A gang of wrangling "pugs" trying to bulldoze a referee would not
be more coarse or hoodlum-like in their conduct than are these representatives of California law
in the Alturas courtroom.
Lynching such as that which was committed in Modoc Count}', and for which certain per
sons are now being tried, is but. a violation of law for which law officers and the law-abiding
people of the community are not responsible, unless by a neglect to bring the offenders to justice
they make themselves indorsers of the criminals. Flagrant outrages like those reported from
the Alturas court on the other hand arc a degradation of law in the very temple of justice by the
very men who are sworn to uphold justice. The bench and the bar of Modoc are not responsible
for the lynching, but they are certainly responsible for the degradation of the court. All Califor
nia suffers when such scenes are permitted within her courtrooms. They are an outrage to civil
ization itself. Public sentiment in the State at large cannot tolerate barbarism of that kind, and
if the people of Modoc desire the respect of their fellow-Californians they must devise some means
of enforcing respect for the dignity of the courts.
GENERALS IN POLITICS.
INCIDENT to the discussion of free trade with Cuba the country is being furnished the in
teresting spectacle of several generals of the army in politics.
General Wood has made special'pilgrimage from Havana to Washington to instruct
Congress in its obligation to give "stable, prosperity to Cuba," and incidentally vote out of
the pockets of American land-owners an annual profit of about $200 per acre to Cuban land
owners. He returned to the island declaring that his mission had succeeded and a panic in Ha
vana would be averted. There are sighs that are admonitory reading for members of Con
gress that say there will -be a panic at the polls in many a district if General Wood's prophecy
come true. . â  â 
The farmers and planters are not devoted to one-sided protection any longer. Time was
that they were content to feed manufacturing labor and were. happy in the. belief that it paid
them better prices out of the better wages caused by protection of manufactures. But the grow
ing, agricultural surplus has compelled the farmer to seek a market abroad, where he has to sell
in competition with the world and at the world's price. But he has to buy at home and? pay the
protected price for manufactured articles. He has but one way to get a part of the benefit -of
protection under these circumstances. He also must have a protected monopoly of the home
market, so that 'he, too, can recoup himself for the low price of his exported surplus by the high
price permitted by protection. He demands in that respect equality with the manufacturer, and
unless he gets it his interest in protection is likely, to decline. The time has gone by in which he
is to stand for American altruism, ready to do and be "done," that manufacturers may flourish.
He desires to do some of the flourishing himself. . -
He is getting protection on sugar and tobacco. v They diversify his crops in many -States.
He is also protected on rice, and can produce it from 'the Carolmas to the Brazos., Every acre
in these three crops is an acre withdrawn from corn and wheat, to the relief of the cereal farmer,
so that protection for sugar, rice and tobacco favorably, affects every acre of farm land whether
planted in those crops or not.
The American farmer is not a peasant. He is an international merchant. He is wise in his
calling and guards his own interests. He also dominates Congress by his vote.
But the :generals in politics are proceeding as if the American farmer were indeed
"a brother of the ox." They are appealing to politicians and professional sentimentalists, those
chronic sympathizers, whose tears' flow at a word, and who are anxious to lift up the lowly every
where outside their own country â at the expense of others.
As General Wood sailed away to Cuba another general appeared on a tour among the
Chambers of Commerce in the Middle West. His credential is his military service in Cuba. He is
instructing mercantile bodies in their duty t6 make Cuba prosperous. His statement of the obli
gation we assumed toward Cuba reads like the forty-acres-and-a-mule v programme for the freed
men at the close of our Civil War. â¢ ,
His knowledge of economics is confined to the payroll he signs for his salary, and to the
conversion of, his commutations into. cash. . He' seems . to regard this country as a cow that is
always fresh, and his duty to be the bringing in of strange calves to suck her. The farmers who
feed the cow are not considered in his economic philosophy. Per haps it will be as well for our
able generals to confine themselves to military matters and leave our civil policy and public
economics alone.
THE STATE AND TUBERCULOSIS.
IT is surprising that so many people contest the right of the States and the nation to co-ordi
nate in measures for the extirpation of consumption. Whenever that policy is mentioned
it is treated in some quarters as an invasion of personal liberty. But to invoke the power
of the State against the evil is well within public authority. The same people who view such
a proposition with alarm are the first to run to the State to isolate smallpox, cholera and the
plague, to disinfect' where they have been, even to the destruction of buildings, or entire blocks
of buildings, by fire, and payment for them out of the public treasury. Yet consumption slays
more, people annually than the combined destruction of life wrought by smallpox, cholera and
plague together, not excluding the ravages of the two last in Asia.
One case of smallpox in any State of this Union causes a panic, and the local and 'State
Boards of Health are called in and the most rigorous legal measures are at once adopted. The
patient is taken from his home, against his protest and that of his family, and confined in. a pest
house. The law denounces him" as a menace to the, lives of others, and his personal rights are
wholly suspended arid his personal liberty denied. Yet smallpox is innocuous compared to con
sumption. Statistics show that the cases of consumption, constantly in existence, the place of
each victim vacated by death constantly taken by a freshly stricken; recruit, run in numbers of
from five thousand in. the smaller States to five hundred thousand in the more populous!
Suppose that cholera, smallpoxor the plague made such a showing! ; Would any one dis
pute the right of the State to use the most stern measures to right either? It is" no overstatement
to say that consumption is deadlier than either. It is endemic everywhere. It takes no vacation.
It is not sporadic nor epidemic. It is in every county in the United States, and; in some, in every
township. It goes on' in summer and in winter. Neither heat nor cold checks it; It shrivels the
physical power of its victim, removes him from the productive forces of the country, affects un
favorably the economic strength of the whole community. Therefore this disease impairs the
national power. To concert public measures to check it, to arrest its progress, to exterminate
it; is among the highest duties of government '.,''Â»;â â¢

GENIUS OF JOE JEFFERSON
NOT MANIFEST IN ASPIRING
SON OF FAMOUS OLD ACTOR
ZANGWILL somewhere discourses
with point and eloquence upon the
choice of parents. I forget his ad
vice to those intending to become
the sons of great men, but imagine
it must have been Mr. Punch's to those
about to â marr>-"Don't!" There Is an
art in being the son of a great man that
seems particularly difficult of mastery,
and characteristically unapproachable by
those who have most need of its re
sources. One of its chief laws seems to
consist in making sure of. a maternal pro
genitor of distinction, and further, in do
ing anything else than what your father
did before vou.
There is no question that Thomas Jef
ferson, the son of Joe of that. ilk. has
taken every care to provide himself ex
cellently in the first regard, but he has
vitally erred in the second and equally
important requisite to a virtuoso-like son
ship to a great man. An actor father,
the son also devotes himself to Thespls;
the father a wizard in two roles, the son
would also seek fame in one of these;
old "Rip," with the characteristic habit of
surrounding himself with dramatic make
weights and young "Rip" with the iden
tical same Inexpensive vice, in exag
gerated form. t
The Rip Van Winkle of Thomas Jeffer
son is, as a matter of fact, and almost
of course, a failure. Naturally he has the
technique of the character to the last
minute requirement, the gesture, accent,
cap, coat and trews of the lovable no
'count. But there Is no leg In the breeches,
as the painters say. no heart under the
vest, no head under the cap. It is a
walking technique, a dramatic thing that
casts no shadow, without light, life or
body and finally an affair of misused con
science. That Mr. Jefferson has the mi
metic art is undeniable. His "Rip" is an
excellent Imitation of. his father's. That
he has Industry and conscience is equally
unmistakable, no smallest detail of the
mechanics of the character being neg
lected. That he has good taste, ample
intelligence and much individual charm
is also not to be denied, but that his
brains, conscience and emotional talents
are worse than lost on "Rip Van Winkle"
âperhaps on the stage at allâ is no less a
matter of certalntv.
It would have made a difference of mo
ment to the show as a whole if the dra
matic furniture surrounding Jefferson had
suggested only for a charitable moment
that its legs were long enough to reach
the ground. There Is absolutely no ex
cuse for such a companyâ save the mark!
The Jeffersons are of the plutocracyâ if a
modest million counts for anything in this
billionalredomâ and to offer with a
warmed-over "Rip" the dregs and orts of
the green room is a "lee tie" too much
even for the stomach of gratefulest mem
ory. That much for a possible pecuniary
reason. If, on the other hand, the com
pany represents a desire for contrast to
his own luminosity on the part of the
star, then it can only be said that he Is
ir. credibly modest. An actor requiring as
shadow to his own brilliance the arche
typal badness of Mr. Jefferson's assist
ants would better put up his shutters and
go to selling peanuts for his dally beer.
Indubitably Mr. Jefferson knows very
much better; still. It's a free country and
if he can gather in the dust as the son
of his father even with these raggedest
of retainers, one can only say with ad
miring envy, "Let her 'Rip,' Jefferson!"
God rest you, merry gentlemen.

THE FEAR OF HUMBUG
Preventa Many People From Trying
a Good Medicine.
Stomach troubles are so common and in
most cases so obstinate to cure that people
are apt to look with suspicion on - any
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma-
nent cure for dyspepsia and Indigestion.
Many such pride themselves on their
acuteness in never being humbugged,
especially in medicines.
This fear of being humbugged can be
carried too far, so far, In fact, that many
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money In faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets.
Now, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different in one Important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines, for
the reason that they are not a secret pat-
ent medicine. No secret Is made of their
ingredients, although they are sold by all
druggists under protection of trade mark,
but analysis shows them to contain the
natural digestive ferments, pure aseptic
pepsin, the digestive acids, Golden Seal,
bismuth, hydrastls and ' nux. They are
not cathartic, neither do they act power-
fully on any organ, but they cure indiges-
tion on the common sense plan of digest-
ing the food eaten thoroughly before it
has time to ferment, sour and cause the
mischief. This is the only secret of their
success.
Cathartic pills never have and never can
cure indigestion and stomach troubles, be-
cause they act entirely on the bowels,
whereas the whole trouble Is really In the
stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals digest the food. That is all there is
to it. Food not digested or half-digested
is poison, as it creates gas, acidity, head-
acnes, palpitation of the heart, loss of
flesh and many other troubles which are
often called by some other name. , .

LAYING OF RAILS
WILL SOON BEGIN
New Road to Stretch
to Fall River Mills
Country.
Capitalists Procure Right of
Way and Construction
. Will Be Rushed.
El*clal Dispatch to Tbe Call.
REDDING, Dec. 21.â St. Louis railroad
and mining capitalists have procured
the right of way for a sixty-mile railroad
from Bella Vista or Kennett to Fall
River Mills, passing by the Bully Hill
smelters and through Thomas B. Walker's
great timber holdings. They agree to
begin actual construction of a road cost-
Ing nearly $1,000,000 in sixty days. Partial
purveys have already been made and a
local engineer and party will take the
field i\-ith $G0,000 cash at their disposal.
The road will follow the copper belt and
traverse a rich area of farming and tim
ber land. There is every reason to be
lieve that Its projectors purpose . to ulti
mately extend It from Fall River Mills
across the Oregon line 100 miles distant
to connect with a branch of the Chi
cago end Northwestern, giving transcon
tinental connection.
The road is projected by the recently
incorporated Shasta Mineral Belt Rail
road Company. D. P. Doak of St. Louis
is president and T. A.Â» Johnson of that
city is secretary. Both are railroad men.
The ether directors are mining capital
ists of New York. The scheme has been
fully investigated. Moving with all pos
sible Becrecy, the company has run pre
liminary surveys and has procured agree
ments for right of way deeds upon the
condition that actual building be started
within two months. Samuel E. Brackins,
ex-County Surveyor, has been chief engi
neer.
The road will either follow Pit River
from Kennett or from the terminus of the
Terry Railroad at Bella Vista, twelve
miles from Anderson. It is believed that
Thomas B. Waiker. the Minnesota lum
ber king, who has acquired immense tim
ber holdings along the line of the road.
Is interested or has a contract with its
builders. The projectors are believed to
have plans involving the development of
copper and iron properties whose present
remoteness renders them unprofitable.

and It is believed fatally wounded "Happy
Tom" Burrell. a saloon-keeper, at 7:30
o'clock to-night Burrell and his wife

of leaving his door partly open and keep
ing watch of the movements of the Bur
rells and others in the house. Burrell
came us the stairs from the street this
evening and seeing Clegg's door partly
open called in to him that he was evi
dently "rubbernecking" again and that he
"had his lamps going," meaning that
Clegg was watchful of the doings, of his
fellow roomers.
An angry altercation followed and it is
asserted that Burrell struck at Clegg with
a cane. Clegg says he had a pistol near
by and reaching for it proceeded to de
fend himself from the assault of Burrell,
a younger and stronger man. He shot
Burrell in the abdomen and as the latter
turned shot again, the bullet lodging In
the back. Clegg then walked downstairs
and surrendered himself to an officer.
Mrs. Burrell declares that her husband
did not strike Clegg with the cane, but
that she heard the blow land on the door
casing. At the police station Clegg ex
hibited a contusion on the forehead which
he asserted was inflicted by Burrell with
the cane.
Burrell probably will die. He came to
Sacramento from Placerville to engage in
the saloon business.

Harris of Attempt
on Her Life.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALTURAS, Dec. .2Lâ Judge ' G. F. Har
ris, one of the attorneys representing
James TV. Brown, the Alleged leader of
the Modoc mob that lynched old Calvin
Hall, his three sons and Daniel Yantls
last May, was arrested. this afternoon en
a charge that he committeed an assault
with a deadly weapon. 'The complainant
is Mary Lorenzo, one of the leading wit
nesses for the prosecution. She was
standing in Laird's store when Judge

Insulting remark. The woman resented
it by slapping his face. He repeated the
remark and she slapped him again.

ris drew a knife, but he was held by
Judge Cherry and others while the
woman was taken from the store. Judge
Harris, it is said, was intoxicated.
The cross-examination of Agnes Wilson,
the half-breed girl, ocwupied the entire
day, in the trial of Brown. Most of the
morning was taken up. in argument 1 by
counsel, which at times became so heateil
that the jury was excused from the room.
The, cross-examination only served to
bring out more fully the details of the
cruelty practiced by Brown and his com
panions, who formed the party that ar
rested the Halls. Agnes declared that
Browa slapped her mother and that they
were subjected to indecent treatment by
the Deputy Constable and his men, who
searched the persons of the witness and
her mother on the excuse that they might
have had stolen articles about them.

CASE OF CUBA
PROMISES STRIFE
Lawmakers Will Be Busy
With Reciprocity
Measures.
Changes May Be Made in
the Philippine Tariff
Schedule.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
TV.. WASHINGTON, Dec 21.â Cuban
reciprocity -will be taken up by the Ways
and Means Committee immediately after
the reassembling of Congress. It is likely
to come before the House soon after ac
tion on the canal bill and it will be the
big fight of the session.
"I wonder if we have made a mistake
on this Philippine tariff bill." Thus spoke
a. prominent member of the Ways and
Means Committee to-day. The recom
mendation . of . the Philippine Commission
for a reduction of 50 per cent In the Ding
ley rates on leading products of .the isl
ands has opened the eyes of several Re
publican leaders and- it Is safe to say
that had this advice come before the bill
came out of committee it would not have
passed the House in Its present form.
The President consulted Senators Lodge
and Platt of Connecticut to-day on the
question of Cuban tariffs and soon after
ward Henry T. Oxnard, as head of the
beet sugar" organization, called at the
White House. The allied sugar forces
have concluded that the administration Is
determined to force a reduction of the
tariff on Cuban sugar and" Oxnard called
to propose a compromise plan, which pro
vides for a bounty to Cuban planters In
order to put their sugar business on a
paying basis.
This scheme contemplates exacting full
Dingley rates - and then paying enough
back to encourage the Industry in the isl
and and preventing bankruptcy. Oxnard
thinks this will help the Cubans and do
no injury to home producers. He said
after the conference to-day that the Pres
ident would give it attention.
Although a majority of the Republican
members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee are still opposed to making conces
sions to Cuba on sugar and tobacco, the
matter is to be forced upon their atten
tion at once by the Republican minority
on the committee and members of the
Cabinet. The Democrats have not yet
shown their hand. As a matter of fact
they are cutting a small figure In Con
gress and only this week let slip an op
portunity to lay up future trouble f 6r the
Republican majority by mismanagement
and Inaction in the Philippine tariff. A
Republican House leader who favors the
relief of Cuba -said to-day:
"This question ha3 reached a stage
where it is something more than a mat
ter of protecting local interests. It has
a great moral side: it has to do with the
salvation or ruination of Cuba: It means
carrying out or neglecting our solemn ob
ligations. We are bound to do something
more than mere pacification of the Islands
whether it Is expressly stated In the bond
or not. I realize that we are against a
very hard combination."

Banker William Beckman, charged with

at St. Vincent's Cemetery yesterday. The
party, which came from Benlcia, was
leaving the cemetery when a horse driven
by Miss Fisher of Benicia took fright and
started off at a mad gallop. The run
away came into collision with a wagon
in which were John and An tone Borges,
farmers well known in Vallejo. Both
buggy and wagon were wrecked, and the
Borges brothers and Miss Fisher were
thrown to the ground.
As Antone Borges fell Miss Fisher's
horse stepped upon the unfortunate man,
striking him on the breast, face and back
of the head. The latter Injury caused
concussion of the brain. Miss Fisher was
seriously Injured, and there Is slight hope
for her recovery.

Flans of Projectors of the line From
Valdes Into the Copper Elver
Country.
TACOMA, Dec. 21.â I*. C. Dlllman, who
returned yesterday from New York, says
that there Is absolutely no doubt of the
early construction of a railroad 140 miles
Ions Into the Copper River districts from
Valdes. * Dillman displays a contract, call-
Ing for the construction of the road, the
sale of twenty-eight claims of the famous
Bonanza group for $1,200,000 and the erec
tion of a smelter. The approximate cost
of the latter will be $300,000. .
Dlllman has been In New York for sev
eral months effecting the deal Involving
millions of dollars. He represented own
ing miners and made the sale to Charles
G. "Weir, a New York mfnlng expert. The
latter is said to represent an English syn
dicate. Dillman said:
"I have secured. the sum asked by the
owners for the claims. Nearly all own
ers have accepted the proposition. The
conclusion of the transfer will come when
these men deliver their property to Mr.
Weir. Mr. "Weir, on behalf of his clients,
has contracted to build the railroad and
the Bmelter. The only possible hitch
could be a refusal of the proprietors who
have not yet accepted to dispose of their
claims. -
"The estimated cost of the railroad Is
$3,500,000. Of Its construction there re
mains no longer a doubt. In the unlikely
event that the mining properties were not
delivered, the railroad would be built any
way. Mr. Weir's clients have determined
upon this."
ThÂ« owners of the Bonanza gronp were
B. F. Millard, B. F. McLellan, W. S.
Amey, H. H. Fitch, J. L. Sweeney, J.
H. Smith, D. 8. King and A. Warner. The
terms upon which the Bale 'was made were
B per cent of the total of $1,200,000. or $60,
000. upon delivery and the remainder after
an Investigation proved the worth of the
properties.

Recognizes the Highway

Special Dispatch to The Call,
TKIAH, Dec. 21.â One Mendoeino stage
robber came to grief to-day and his ar
rest and confession came as a surprise to
the residents of this vicinity. The cul
yrit proved to be himself the driver of a
ft age, who, between trips, amused him
self and added to his assets by robbing
coaches driven by other knights of the
rein. In his arrest the county officials
may have landed the man who. during
the summer months, made travel: by
stasre in this region expensive to many
summer resort visitors. Robberies were
numerous and the lone highwayman who
committed them always selected a stage
crowded with wealthy city folk going for
a sojourn at the beautiful Lake County
resorts, reached from points along the
Northwestern railroad.
The southbound stage, known as the
"overland," was stopped and robbed at
6 o'ciock this morning by a masked man
one mile above "Willits. The rob
ber took Wells - Fargo' s box and
the mail sack. George Cook, the
driver, believed he recognized the
robber's voice as that of John Ivans,
who drives the stage between Willits and
_ ort Bragg. On arriving in WIllIls Cook
went to Ivaxis' room and found he was

at s o'clock and had not been seen in
Willits after that until 7 o'clock. Cook
charged Ivans -with the crime and the
accused man made a vehement denial.
Sheriff Smith started for Willits when
notified and found on his arrival there
that Ivans had not been formally arrest
ed, though the Sheriff's son. Charles
Smith" of Willits, had the suspect under
surveillance. Sheriff Smith swore out a
warrant and arrested Ivans. He started
for Uklah with his prisoner and on the
way Ivans confessed the robbery and
told where the express box and gun were
concealed. He said he did not have time
to open the box and intended to return

He said that See Chong had been conduct

TO DEFUNCT BANK'S DEPOSITORS
To Preserve Spotless the Family Name They Pay in

Which Failed Under Their Cousins' Management
KINGS OF FINANCE WHO WILL GIVE MORE THAN A HALF MILLION
DOLLARS IN CASH AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO CREDITORS OF
A -COLLAPSED BANK IN TACO MA. . â <â  \ - - â¢ .
t-nsiACOMA, Dec. 2Lâ George W. Van
11 derbilt. William K. Vanderbilt
I and Frederick W. Vanderbilt to-
R day deposited 5509,000 In a New
York bank, subject to the
order of Charles McNamee. their legal ad
viser and representative, who is now here.
This money will be used In paying In full
the depositors of the Metropolitan Eank,
which suspended on November 19. ,
This generous action on the part of the
Vanderbilts results from a desire to keep
the family name spotless In the business
world. They had neither legal nor moral
responsibility in the Metropolitan Bank
failure. Their only connection with It lay
in the fact that it was managed by Philip
Vanderbllt Caesar and Jacob Vanderbilt,
third and second cousins of the men who
to-day advanced a half million dollars to
pay off depositors.
In May. 1S98. George W. Vanderbilt per
sonally advanced $500,000 under almost
Similar circumstances to liquidate the
Metropolitan Savings Bank. He took the
assets and has since realized something
upon them, leaving his net loss about
$300,000.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, 1 SUNDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1901.
The only difference between the situ
ation then and now was that George Van
derbilt â was a stockholder in the Metro
politan Savings Bank, having become In
terested in the concern through an effort
to help his nephew, Philip V. Caesar.
Finding the bank's affairs in bad shape
he had McNamee come to Tacoma and
liquidate. McNamee issued a public notice
to the effect that Vanderbilt had no in
terest in the Metropolitan Bank, which
was immediately organized and opened by
Caesar, Jacob Vanderbilt and T. W.
Er.os, who had been officers of the' old
bank.
The liquidation of the old bank and the
knowledge that these men were connected
v.dth the Vanderbilt family Inspired public
confidence to such an extent that they did
a large business from the start, consider
ing that the bank had a capital of only
$50,000, of which $30,000 was paid up. Early
in November it had deposits of nearly
$600,000. ' â¢
Depositors Start a "Bun."
At that time tho National Exchange
Bank of New York sued for a receiver
ship for the remaining 1 assets of the old
Metropolitan Savings Bank, claiming to
be dissatisfied with the settlement offered
by George W. Vanderbilt' s representa
tive. A ten-line notice of this suit in a
local paper caused misapprehension. A
large number of Scandinavian depositors
believing that a receiver was wanted for
the new Metropolitan Bank, a "run" re
sulted and in a few days the depositors
had withdrawn $90,000, leaving only $6000
in cash on hand.
Two days after the bank failed Presi
dent Philip Caesar went to New York to
consult the Vanderbilt family. It is un
derstood here that he was not cordially
welcomed, but, nevertheless, through Mc-
Namee, who is business manager . for
George W. Vanderbilt, negotiations were
commenced looking toward a settlement
of the bank's affairs.
McNamee arrived here two weeks ago
and began a thorough investigation. His
report, together with the recommenda
tion that the money be advanced to pay
all depositors, was forwarded by mail,
reaching New York two days ago. George
W. Vanderbilt considered that it would
be unfair for him to stand the loss en
tirely alone and presented the matter to
William K. and Frederick W. Vanderbilt.
with the result that they voluntarily of
fered to aid in advancing the necessary
money. McNamee received a telegram
this afternoon announcing that the neces
sary money had been deposited in' New-
York, subject to his order.
Price of Spotless Name.
The amount advanced to-day, together
with that paid by George W. Vanderbilt
four years ago, makes more than $1,000,
000 which the Vanderbilt family has ad
vanced to pay Tacoma depositors in the
two Metropolitan banks. The assets of
the new bank are valued at about $200,000,
which will leave a net loss, after settling'
the affairs of both institutions, of about
$600,000. ,
The new bank had 3200 depositors, most
of whom were working- people. The bank
failure had greatly affected Christmas
trade and there was great rejoicing in
Tacoma to-night over this second act of
wholesale generosity on the part of the
Vanderbilt family.
There has been talk among depositors
of the possibility of criminal proceedings
against the officers of the new bank, but
its liquidation by the Vanderbilts will un
doubtedly forestall any such action.

PLANS FEASTS
FOR EPICURES
Montana Man Proposes
to Raise Thousands
of Trout.
Legal Technicality ' Will Be
Overcome by a Private
Pond.
Sneclal Dispatch to The Call.
' HELENA, Mont., Dec. 21.â Epicures
claim that no greater delicacy can be
found under the sun than Montana moun
tain trout. When Michael Kerchner, of
Victor perfects all the arrangements now
ui'der way he will be able to evade a
technicality of the law and provide a sup
ply of trout for all the markets of the
country.
The game and fish laws of all the
mountain States provide a penalty for the
selling of trout caught in any public
stream; but fish taken from, private
pends may be disposed of as the owner
wills. Kerchner has no less a project un
der way than the construction of an Im
mense private fish hatchery and catchery,
by means of which he can place hundreds
of thousands of speckled beauties In
eastern and western markets every year.
Tne ponds are all constructed arid stocked
with 25,000 trout, but this, Kerchner says,
is too small a number to begin with In a
commercial way. Kerchner gives the fol
lowing Interesting details of the business,
â which he says "beats ranchin' all hoi
low":
"The 25,000 trout we now have on hand
are of three sizesâ two, three and four
years old. They are considered about right
for the market when they are three years
old. We have been promised a large sup
ply of eggs from the Government hatch
eries in the spring. We will not enter the
market with them until we have two or
three hundred thousand on hand.
"Perhaps you don't know that trout
are cannibals ; among their kind. They
1-reyupon each other's eggs ahd ; devour
the small fry. It la therefore necessary
to take the eggs from the fish and to keÂ«p
all tho fish of one ago by themselves.
When they get ready to spawn, trout, liko
salmon, run to shallow water. We have
provided such a spawning bed for them.
It is estimated that, in natural streams,
at least 95 per cent of the eggs are de
stroyed. We expect, with care and dili
gence, to save at least 95 per cent."

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A FEW REASONS '
Which, Are Rapidly Making a New
Catarrh Cure Famous.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, the hew Ca-
tarrh cure, has the following advantages'
over other catarrh remedies:
First: These tablets contain ' no co-
caine, morphine or any other injurious
drug and are as safe and beneficial for
children as for adults; this is an import-
ant point when It Is recalled that many
catarrh remedies- do contain these very
obiectionable ingredients.
Next: Being in tablet form this rem-
edy does not deteriorate with age or an
exposure to the air, as liquid preparations
invariably do.
Next: The tablet form not only pre-
serves the medicinal properties, but it is
so far more convenient to carry and to
use at any time that it is only a question
of time when the tablet will, entirely su-
persede liquid medicines as it has al-
readv done in the medical department of
the United : States army. _ â¢ ;
Next- No secret is made of the compo-
sition of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets; they
contain the active principles of Eucalyp-
tus bark, red gum, blood root and Hy-
drastin, all harmless . antiseptics, which,
however, are death to catarrhal germs
wherever found, because they eliminato
them from the blood.
Next: You can not' cure catarrh by lo-
cal applications to the nose and throat,
because these are simply local symptoms
and euch treatment can not possibly
reach the real : teat of catarrhal disease,
which is in the blood; for this reason, in-
halers, douches, sprays and powders nev-
er really cure catarrh.. but simply give
temporary relief, which' a dose of plain
salt and water â â will-do just as well.
' Catarrh must be driven out of. the sys-
tem out of the blood, .by an internal
remedy because an internal remedy ia the
only kind which can be assimilated into
th stuart's' Ca,tarrh Tablets do this better
"than the old form of treatment because
they contain every safe specific known to
modern science in the antiseptic form of
the disease. ' â â -
' Next: The use of inhalers, and spray-
Ing apparatuses, besides being-Ineffective
and disappointing, is expensive, while a
complete treatment of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets can be had at any drug store in
the .United â  States >f and Canada for | oQ

Francisco â Don't Be Late at

but Realize the Exact Situation
as It Is Everything Would Be
Closed Gut Before Tuesday,
If you are interested in the purchase of
m. fine plano~br org-an -within the next two
years you trill have here now the most
extraordinary opportunity to secure a
good Instrument at a tremendous saving
in price.
A short time ago In order to secure our-
selves we were compelled to accept a
large stock of pianos, consisting of Steln-
way. Emerson, Estey, Starr and other
well known makes, and in order to dis-
pose of these instruments by the first of
the year we have decided to make a grreat
retail slaughter sale of them, Including
also as a special advertising feature ln
this sale our entire large wholesale stock
of etrlctly high grade pianos, carried at
our salesrooms, 645 Market street, second
floor* upstairs, in the Bishop building.
But nine days remain until the end of
the year, and we realize that only the
most sensational price cutting will move
this large stock of nearly two hundred
fine pianos within that time. But we are
determined to close out the entire stock
of Instruments before taking any further
leasÂ© of the premises, and while we re-
gret to make euch low figures or open
cut ln prices as to disturb the immediate
future of the music trade of this city, we
feel obliged to make such low prices as
will dispose of every instrument in these
warerooms within the next nine days.
"We have here now and for sale besides
the above mentioned stock of Stelnway,
Emerson, Estey and Richmond pianos the
finest assortment of the New Scale Kim-
ball pianos ever displayed on the coast,
besides eucb well known and strictly re-
liable makes as Milton, 'Whitnej-, Hinze
and other cheaper brands, a hundred and
ninety-six fine new pianos in all. We
have also a number of new odd sample
pianos, of various malces and in any and
all styles. "We offer to take for them the
exact wholesale or factory cost, which
means to you at least or nearly one-half
lower prices than these or same grades of
â¢Instruments regularly retail for in this or
eny other city.
The New Scale KImball Piano is now
recognized as the leading and greatest
American pianoforte, strictly high grrade
aud first class. Steinway pianos are so
well known ln San Krancisco as to need
no further Introduction. We offer Mon-
day the most beautiful oak cased, seven
and one-third octave. Ftrlctly high grade,
upright piano for fSU. which is almost
one-half price.
We offer the largest walnut or mahog-
any cased Sch!rmer upright -pianos for
$117. They are considered worth J2.*0
everywhere. These pianos have three
pedals, revolving lockboard and swinging
music desk, three strings throughout.
Regular $300 etyles, which have never
been sold even in the East for less than
5275, can be secured to-morrow for $137,
and the fanciest styles, also with three
pedals, are now offered for 5156. Easy
monthly payments if desired.
Choice of several so-called $G00 Stelnway
upright pianos, brand new and fully war-
ranted by the factory, as well as by our-
selves. $285.
Choice of a carload of Emerson and
Gramer pianos at 518G, for either walnut
or oak cases. Fully warranted.
A number of brand new Estey uprights,
also several Starr pianos, retail value 5400
now jni 5218 and 5247 for the fanciest
styles. Factory warrantees also accom-
pany these instruments. k
The Nugent pianos, brand new. fo long
as the supply lasts will go for 5122.50; also
on easy payments If desired.
Don't miss this sale if the savins of
money Is aa object Retail dealers will
tell you that new pianos cannot regularly
be sold at such low prices and yield even
a nominal profit to the seller, and If that
is the case, then our loss Is your gain
All other Instruments in the wholesale
stock will be slaughtered at correspond-
ingly low figures. This Is certainly the
most opportune time to buy a good piano
and if you are not prepared to pay all
cash down, we will arrange time pay-
ments with any responsible buyer
With the exception of three, large and
fancy styles on which payments must be
at least *Â» down and 520 per month, all
instruments can be obtained, at cash
prices on payment of 525 or $15 down and
$10 or $8 per month, with Interest on de-
ferred payments at 8 per cent per annum.
Regular five years' written guarantee
will accompany each instrument sold
duly countersigned *y us, thus making
these Instruments as safe to buy as Gov-
ernment bonds. And If you have unv
pcsslble use for a piano come tou s b^t

nine days these instruments will all be

CHILD ATTEMPTS
TO KILL HERSELF
Sadie Herron Drinks Car
bolic Acid to End
Existence.
Claims That She Was Abused
and Beaten by Her
Guardian.
Despondent because of alleged ill treat
ment by her aunt and guardian, 13-year
old Sadie Herron tried to end her life
yesterday afternoon at the home of her
brother, Robert Herron. S19A Tenth
street, by swallowing a dose of carbolic
acid.
Fortunately the child had diluted the
poison before drinking it and beyond brt
ing burned slightly about the mouth and
face will not suffer from its effects.
The little girl was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital. The condition of
her clothes showed that/she h.iil not re
ceived proper attention. Upon being
asked the reason for her aia-mpt upon
her life she related a pitiful story.
Some four years ago, the girl said, her
mother died and a year later her faihor
was claimed by death. After her parent*
demise the orphan girl was sent to the
St. Joseph Asylum, where she remained
until about a year ago, when she was
given Into the care of an aunt, Mrs.
Nellie Meyers, who resides at 10 Mor
ris avenue. A Bhort time' after she
had made her home in her aunt's house,
"tho girl claims, her new guardian com
menced to beat her and as time pae^ed
the beatinss were administered more fre
quently and became more severe. The
child said:
On the least provocation, and ofttlme* with
out reason or cause, my uunt would whip me,
using a heavy etrnp on my naked body.
My aunt would kpep me locked ln the house
after I had returned from school and would
threaten me with a beatlne If 1 went on the
street to play. No matter what I did. she
â vvoull find fault and scold me. She made me
do all the darnin* for the family, and when
I would finish that work she would undo it
and, after rapping- me over the knuckles with
a pair of scissors, would compel me to do the.
work again. My aunt never talked to me ex
cept to scold and would keep me ln a room
by myself.
Many times I was covered with black and
blue marks from the beatings I would get.
but except on one occasion, when I showed
them to my younger brother, who lives in the
house, I was afraid to tell any one.
Every morning- I was compelled to set up
and have breakfast for Mr. Meyers at 6 o'clock.
I became tired of living with my aunt and
left the house to go to the house of my mar
ried brother en Tenth street. I felt lonesome
and thought that nobody cared* for me, and I
wanted to die and be with my mother.
Mrs. Meyers, the accused aunt, called at
the hospital during the evening to see
her niece. She declared that she had
tried to make her home a pleasant one
for the child. "The girl Is stubborn and
hard to manage," the aunt said, "and
when she says that I abused her sho is
romancing-. She left my house a week
ago without cause."
The girl modified her statements some
what ln the presence of her aunt, but
after Mrs. Meyers had gone she reiterated
her former story.
According to. the girl's statement her
older brother contributed to her support
and that of a yo.unger brother who lives
with Mrs. Meyers.
SULLIVAN'S FATE
WITH THE JURY
Alleged Jury-Briber Is
Awaiting Verdict
in Chicago.
CHICAGO. Dec. 21.â Arguments for the
defense of Alexander Sullivan, closed to
day and Assistant State's Attorney
Barnes followed and asked the Jury to
send Sullivan to the penitentiary for con
spiracy in connection with the corruption
of juries in the civil courts here three
years ago.
Attorney O'Donnell made a strong plea
for his client and tried to show that the
West Chicago Street Railway Company
was the real culprit. He denounced
Lynch's testimony against Sullivan and
took to task the street railway company
and Its directors, whom he called "jury
bribers' masters." It was common
knowledge, he said, that the West Chi
cago Street Railway Company had a de
partment of corruption and dishonor arid
l:e wanted to know If the- jurors thought
it possible that the road had not begun
bribery until 1S97, when Sullivan made a
contract with the road. He also asked
the jury If it was reasonable that the
railway directors bribed or that they had
a man to do it who would not profit by it
a penny.
Judge Smith finished reading his In
structions at 9 p. m. and the case was
given to the jury. At 11 o'clock to-night
the Jury had not agreed and there was
no Immediate prospect of Its doing so.
Loud arguments could be heard from the
jury-room, and it was safd the Jury stood
about evenly divided for acquittal and
conviction. There Is no chance for an an
nouncement before 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning, when Judge Smith will open
court to hoar a report from the Jury.
Arch.bish.op Praises Arbitrators.
CHICAGO. Dec. 2Lâ Archbishop Ireland
of St. Paul was in Chicago for a few
hours to-day on his w f ay home from New
York. Commenting with much optimism
on the recent formation in the metropolis
of the arbitration commission, he said:
"The commission was a great success,
both on account of the character of the
men who took part In it, of the objects
which they propose to, pursue and of the
possibilities of the results to follow. It
was no small thing to bring together the
chief labor leaders of the country, em
ployers representing the largest industrial
operations, as well as those men who
spoke for public opinion and general prln
jciples of justice rather than for the spe
cial interests of labor or capital."
Angels Defeat All-Americas.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 21.â Hate's phe
nomenal pitching and the perfect fielding
of the Los Angeles team served to shut
out the All Americas to-day. Only five
scattering hits were made off Hale and
three of these were of the short infield
order. .Not once did one of the visitors
reach third base. The locals found Bern
hard quite easy and batted out five runs.
The game was a record breaker ln the
matter of time, only an hour and thirteen
minutes being occupied ln playing the full
nine innings. The last game of the series
will be played to-morrow, when Waddell
and McPartlin will be the opposing pitch
ers.

Another innovation ln the formation of
the force of nearly 1000 men who form the

HELENA, Mont. Dec. 21.â The proverb
of "Doctor, take your own medicine "
seems to have been^exempliOed in this
city, when Julius Lelirkind, a well-known
Bozeman brewer, declared on tile witness
stand in the district court that he fre
quently consumed fifty glasses of bee^ in
an evening, without injuring his health
or disturbing his mental equipoise.
Lehrkind was suing John Stelnbrenner
ror the price of a carload of malt, the
latter claiming he never ordered the malt
and would have no more use for it than
he would for a white elephant. He
claimed that Lehrkind was intoxicated.
The plaintiff strenuously denied this last
allegation. He admitted that he drank a
couplÂ© of dozen glasses of beer at the
time, but that his intellect was not the
least befogged thereby. Then he de
clared that fifty glasses would not in
toxicate him. - Nevertheless, the jury

ONLY A SCHEME,
SAYS MORGAN
Senator v' Speaks of the
â Panama Canal Com
pany's Offer.
Declares That It Is an Attempt
to Retard Legis
lation. â¢
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
"ST.*, WASHINGTON, Dec. LI.â "I have
read the proposition of the Panama Canal
Company, cabled from Paris," said Sena
tor Morgan to-night, "and I do not regard
it worthy of serious consideration. It is
but another attempt to retard the passage
of the Nicaragua canal bill during the
present session of Congress.
"In the first place the United States
cannot negotiate with the Panama Canal
Company for the purchase of its Interests
on the istbmus. This talk of the canal
company being willing to sell to the
United States Government at the figures,
$40,000,000, named by the Canal Commis
sion Is like so much hot air from Paris
blowing against the White House . at
Washington to those who have given the
subject Intelligent consideration.
"It is known that the Canal Commis
sion, of which Admiral Walker was presi
dent, never considered any proposition to
purchase the Panama canal property. The
commission had no authority to negotiate
for the purchase of a Panama canal. Ad
miral Walker simply Inquired of M. Hu
tln what he had to offer, so the commis
sion could report to Congress the facts
In the case. If it should become necessary
for this Government to open up negotia
tions for the possession of the Panama
omul property, the first step would be to
negotiate with the Colombian Govern
ment, the owner of the land, and next
with the French Government, to whom
the concession was grunted; It is absurd
tn discuss n proposition of jthe Panama
CaiiHl i'nmuany to sell out Its Interests
to this Government. It will have no effect
up"n the progress of pending measures tn
Coiigress, and unless I am very much mis
taken both houses of Congress will take
definite action in the direction of com
mencing work upon the canal before the
present session adjourns.
"Of course, there will be obstruction? of
various kinds thrown across the pathway
of the Nicaragua canal project, but I am
confident that President Roosevelt Is
deeply interested ln the construction of
the canal, and he will render valuable as
sistance to friends of the measure ln Con
gress, so that those persons who are spec
ulating on defeating the bill by procrasti
nation are apt to be disappointed when
the roll is called."

Comes Down From Ages.
NEW YORK, Dec. .21.â In speaking tc
nlght at the twenty-second annual dinner
of the New England Society in the city

Massachusetts, who was the guest of
honor, said: / - ;
There was a wireless telegraphy that came
down across the ages from the men of Mar
athon and â¢ Thermopylae to the men of the
Mayflower, and came from the men of thÂ«
Mayflower to the men of the revolution, and
came from the men of the revolution to our
splendid youth of 1861. It is not everywhere
on earth that the receiving stations of these
signals are to be found. Possibly there is a
spot in South Africa to-day where a race of
Dutch farmers have been able to. comprehend
the message. I trust there are some men still
left ln the United States who have ears to
hear. Possibly Asuinaldo may have cot a

JURY AWARDS
HALF A MILLION
Large Mining Suit at
Council Bluffs Is
Decided.
COUNCIL. BLUFFS, Iowa, Dec ZLâ The.
Jury ln the Doyle-Burns mining suit, ln
which James Doyle asks for a million
dollars In stock and dividends of the Port
land Mining Company, returned a verdict
late this afternoon awarding the plaia
tlfr J446.U22 73. Burns' attorneys at once
save notice of a motion for a new trial
and will argue it next Saturday. "If. a
new trial is not granted," said Senator
Patterson, "we will appeal the case to a
higher court."
The jury twice asked Judge Green for
further and renewed Instructions, and
also asked him to define two of ths ques
tions offered by the defendant.
The verdict decides that Burns and
Doyle entered into a contract February
2, 1892, by which each should share and
share alike In all claims they bad at that
time acquired or should ln the future ac
quire. It decided that the plaintiffs in
terests ln the Professor Grubbs and the
defendant's interests ln the Portland mlna
were not acquired under an agreement
made March 14. 1S92, and that Doyle made
his first demand for the stock ln contro
versy February 2. 1S0S. They decided that
the market value of the stock was 75
cents per share and that 45 cents ln divi
dends had been paid on ths Portland
when the demand was made.
The verdict declares Burns did not own
an Interest lu the Devil's Own claim when
It was transferred to> the Portland Min
ing Company. The verdict alao finds that
Burns owned an Interest ln the Tidal
Wave and that Doyle owned part of the
Bobtail No. 2 when thÂ» transfer was
made.
The attorneys for Doyle say they will
do nothing until after the motion for a
new trial is heard. They say that they
will insist that a bond bo given, either in
case of appeal or a new trial, and that
It It Is not given they â will petition for
the appointment of a receiver for the
Portland Gold Mining Company, as they
did when they secured a default of Judg
ment ln 1398.

MASO'S FRIENDS
ARE INDIGNANT
They Will Refuse to Par
ticipate in Cuban
Elections.
Governor-General Wood's De
cision Ruffles ths
Politicians.
HAVANA, Dec. 21.â The supporters of
General Maso in his . candidacy for the
Presidency of the republic have decided
to take no part in the coming elections
fixed for December 31. All the candidates
of the party have withdrawn, and the
Maso members of the provincial boards
have been requested to resign. These
sieps were decided upon after the receipt
of a letter from Governor General Wood,
refusing to grant the party representation
on the Board of Scrutiny or an exten
sion of time in which to modify the vot
ing list.
At a meeting cf the party leaders a res
olution was adopted declaring that "the
Central poard is a coalition of partisans,
and that General Maso, after exhausting
every means to insure impartiality, recti
tude and justice at the coming elections,
has become convinced that neither in offi
cial circles in the United States nor in
Cuba does the" Intention exist to see that
the elections are carried out with suffi
cient legality to reflect the real wish of
the Cubans, who are desirous of inde
pendence and anxious to freely elect their
first constitutional Government." r i
It was voted to inform Secretary Root
of the decision arrived at and also to pub
lish a manifesto to the country. La Lu-
Cha applauds the withdrawal of the Maso
candidates, and says that without the
guarantees asked from Secretary Root
every one knows that the election will be
a falsification of the will of the majority.
"The Maso coalition," says La Lucha,
"should not lend themselves to the be
trayal of the public will, and should not
co-operate In a policy which tends to lay
the foundation of the republic on a gi
eantlc fraud."
Besides the so-called Conservatives with
him, Maso is said to have a strong follow
ing among the blacks in the country dis
tricts, and it is intimated in Havana that
this element may not take kindly to the
present condtion of things and may cause
trouble.
The Discusion. the Palma organ, as
serts that the withdrawal of Maso's sup
porters is due to the fact that they are a
hopeless minority and the candidates
have no chance of being- elected.. .

CAUSES A FALL
IN CABLE STOCKS
Success of. the Wireless
Telegraphy Frightens
Stockholders.
Government of Canada Offers
Marconi Inducements fcr
His Experiments.
LONDON, Dec. 21.â The. fall in the se
curities of cable companies, which com
menced with the announcement of- the
success of Marconi's experiments in hav
ing signals transmitted across the ocean
by his wireless system of telegraphy, has
been continuous throughout the week.
Since December 14 , Anglo r American pre
ferred has dropped 7 points and ordinary
shares have dropped 4 points, while East
ern Telegraph was a close second with a
fall of 5% points.
Quite apart from the speculative bear
movement, there has been a real selling
of stock. The opposition of the Anglo-
American Company to Marconi's experi
ments appears to have increased the ap
prehensions of the shareholders of cable

EXTENT OF STATE.
Some Idea of Vastness of Domain
Tributary to Golden Gate.
California occupies on the Pacific Slope
a belt of land about two hundred miles
wide, extending In latitude from near the
southern line of South Carolina to the
southern line of Massachusetts. To make
up its area from corresponding Atlantic
States there must be added to Connecti
cut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North and South Car
olina, about 40,000 square miles from New
York and Pennsylvania. Laid off in the
Mississippi Valley, on the western shore
of the river, it takes a small strip from
Louisiana and embraces the whole of
Arkansas, Missouri and Iowa. In the
great San Joaquln Valley there is abund
ant room for New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecti
cut and the half of Maine. It is only by
such comparisons as these that the size
of the State and its peculiar advantages
of location can be. appreciated, and it Is
only by considering. these and its climatic
features that any correct judgment can be
formed of its possible or probable future.
When Its fertile hills and broad valleys
shall teem with a population as dense as
that on the Eastern coast, and when its
millions of acres of arable land shall be
brought under culture, occupied by an in
telligent, industrious, thrifty people, it
must become one of the greatest factors
in this our great sisterhood of States.
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE.
The Climatic conditions of California,
when closely considered, upset completely
all preconceived notions of the relations
between latitude and temperature. The
latitude of San Diego, the southern city
of the State, is about that of Charleston,
S. C, while Los Angeles lies a little
farther south than Memphis, Tenn.- The
northern line of California is on nearly
the same parallel with Boston, Mass.
From these facts it might be thought
that, although Southern California has a
sub-tropical climate, adapted to the
growth of the palm and of citrus fruits
the northern part of the State must have
the rigorous winters- of the North Atlantio
States or of Iowa or Nebraska on the
upper Mississippi. This is, however, very
far from being the case. .
Four hundred miles north of L03 Ange
les, and five hundred north of San Diego
the summers are warmer and the winters
not much more severe than In these cities
In many of the northern valleys the palm'
fig and olive find a congenial home, while
the orange and lemon reach their perfec
tion, ripenlngr from four to â¢ six weeks
earlier than In the southern counties
By a careful study of tha topography of
the State and a knowledge of oceanic cur
rents, this apparent â¢ anomaly may bo
rationally explained. The Japan. current
with its warm accompanying winds flows
up against almost tho entire coast of the
State, coming from the southwest. Wher
ever there is a breaking down of the
Coast range, which must occur wherever
the larger rivers rench the ocean, the
warm winds contlnuo their, course Inland
Passing in a.northeosterly direction thoy
nre turned north or northwest by tho
Sierra rango. This forces the Isothermal
lines far north, so' that the summer Iso
thorm takos the form of an inverted capi
tal letter U. ' â¢ . ' " 'â >â ' .';'~â "i m...... .

WIFE LEAVES
TRUANT SPOUSE
Mrs. Mabel Johnson of
New York Obtaics
a Dxvorce;
Husband Recently Figured
in a Sensational
Escapade.
Snecial Disr>atch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â Mrs. Mabel Van
Rensselaer Johnson, prominent in the ex
clusive social circles of New York, has
been granted a divorce from her hus
band, the Rev. James Le Baron Johnson,
who eloped with Miss , Mary'. Hoffman,
daughter of Southard j Hoffman' of San
Francisco. The case has been . conducted
with great secrecy, all parties to the suit
desiring to avoid publicity.* "'â 
It was learned by The Call correspond
ent to-day that a referee was appointed,
and he has for several weeks -been tak
ing testimony. The lawyers interested in
the case refuse to confirm or deny the
fact of a divorce decree signed by Judge
Scott ,of the State Supreme Court, but
there is no doubt that such a decree has
been signed, j For several months there
have'been rumors of divorce proceedings,
but no confirmation of definite 'action
could be obtained until to-day. It is un
derstood that w,hen the papers were
served on the Rev. Mr. Johnson he en
tered a denial of the charges, made and
Charles W. West was appointed referee.
His Teport. that Mrs. Johnson's charges
against her husband were substantiated
by testimony was â  confirmed by Judge
Scott and all- the testimony was ordered
sealed. Thus Miss Hoffman's name was
not disclosed. ; -. - .â¢ -
â¢ James C. - Carter, represented Mrs.
Johnson and the husband was defended
by William C. Cammann. . The : where
abouts of Johnson and Miss Hoffman Is
not known, or if known will not be di
vulged. After their 'departure for Europe
and the -stories of their conduct aboard
an Atlantic steamship -came a rumor from
Italy to the' effect that- they had quar
reled snd separated^ Later came a rumor
from- San Francisco, that they had been
married.' This rumor . of marriage was
shown to be premature at least, for at
this time there had been no divorce pro
ceedings Instituted by Mrs. Johnson.
WOMAN'S DEATH DVE
TO A PECT7LIAR CAUSE
Patient Buptures Her Oesophagus
During an Attac of Acute
' â¢â  Nausea. . â¢
LOS ANGELES, Dec.-21.-The death of
Jeanette Phillips In the: Good Samaritan
Hospital on Thursday as a result of rup
ture of the. oesophagus brings to light
one of the most remarkable fatalities
known to medical science. .The primary,
though indirect, cause of death was acute
and prolonged nausea, following the ad
ministration of an anesthetic prior to an
operation performed last Sunday The
next day her physical condition was good,
but later she began to vomit and tank
steadily until the time of her death, re
fusing all food and continuing to suffer
violent contractions of the stomach. An
autopsy showed that the oesophagus had
been ruptured just above the diaphragm,
allowing foreign matter from theVstom
ach to flow into the. left pleural cavity
when "forced up by cbnfraction. . . This
caused congestion of the left lung and
the absorption of foreign matter into the
circulatory system, which is believed to
have caused blood poisoning.
"I have, never before heard of a case
where death ensued' under such circum-'
stances," s*aid the attending physician to
day. "The oesophagus may be ruptured
by aneurism, malignant disease, the de
structive action of mineral acids or by
the swallowing of a fish bone, but a rup
ture due to vomiting, I believe, is unpre
cedented." . â¢ ' - â¢ â  â¢
Miss Phillips came to Los Angeles from
Denver early this year. Her father was
superintendent of the White Breast Coal
and Fuel Company of Ottumwa, low*. It
is said that Miss Phillips was married in
Denver before coming to this city and
that marital troubles caused a separation.
MORTENSEN IS HELD
ON SUSPICION OP MT7BDES
Evidence That He Is the Assassin of
Secretary Hay of the Pacific
Lumber Company.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 21.â Although
no formal complaint has yet been Issued
charging Peter Mortensen, the contractor,
with the murder of James R. Hay, secre
tary of the Pacific Lumber Company,
whose body was found buried in a shallow
grave In the southern outskirts of this city
Wednesday morning,, the police are be
coming more , and more convinced that
Mortensen, even if he did not commit the
crime himself, was connected with it in
some manner.. Mortensen was arrested
Wednesday, and since that time has been
kept a close prisoner in the City Jail. He
has steadily maintained his innocence and
denies all knowledge of the murder. *
On the day of his arrest the police made
a thorough examination of Mortensen's
house for the purpose of securing Incrim
inating evidence. Hidden behind a book
case, they found what they claimed, at
the time was an old-fashioned revolver.
Two chambers were empty. To-day it de
veloped that the pistol is a modern weap
on and that its. caliber practically corre
sponds with the bullet found in the dead
man's head.
Nothing has yet been found of the miss-
Ing $3800 in gold which Mortensen claims
he paid oven.to Hay on Monday night for
the purposes of canceling his indebtedness
to the lumber company.

KILLS GRIZZLY
AND HER CUBS
Ventura County Hunter
Brings in a Trio
of Bears.
Special Dlscatch to The Coll.
VENTURA, Dec. 21.â United States Sur
veyor Stoner arrived here to-day and told
a" rare story regarding the killing of an
enormous grizzly bear and her two cubs.
Bert Cooper, a hunter of local fame, was
the hero of the hunt. A' corps of Govern
ment surveyors is now at work in the
mountains back of Nordhoff. Cooper is
cooking for the party. Last Thursday he
was riding leisurely along the trail when
suddenly he encountered the three griz
zlies, all alert on their hind legs. The
trio were only thirty feet away. Cooper
jumped to the ground and tied his horse
to a nearby tree. He had only eight
cartridges in his rifle. The moment the
mother bear sighted Cooper she made a
rush for him. Cooper sent a bullet crash
ing through her head, following this shot
up with two others, which satisfied him
of her death.
The cubs yearned to decamp, but the
cook could not overlook the chance to ob
tain some tender bear steaks. By the time
he had killed one of them the other had
made a good start, and Cooper had ex
hausted his supply of cartridges. Nothing
daunted, he started after the cub. His
rifle was broken over the cub's head with
out effect. Then Cooper drew his knife
and slashed at the animal's throat. Soon
the last of the bear trio lay at his fe^t.
The female bear weighed more than 1000
pounds, while the cubs weighed 403 pounds
each. ?<;â . '.

DANIELS' SLAYER
IS SENTENCED
Mrs. Catherine Coarum
to Serve Ten Years
in State Prison.
"
Tells Judge That Women Are
. Punished While Men !
Go Free.
"It is the Judgment of this court, Cath
erine Coarum, that you be confined in the
State Prison at San Quentln for the term
of ten years."
Thus spoke Judge Dunne yesterday to
the slayer of Charles Daniels. The
woman uttered not a word but her looks
spoke volumes. Before she stood up to
receive her sentence she had said her
say. She listened to the words of the
court like a stoic.
Mrs. Coarum killed a watchman named
Charles Daniels at her home, 1133^6 Clay
Etreet, on, April 9, last. She shot him
three times and the crime was discovered
by.'a policeman to whom the neighbors of
the woman reported that at the home of
Mrs. Coarum sounds of hysterical sob
bing could be heard. The officer entered
the house and found Mrs. Coarum, who
is the white wife of a colored cook on a
vessel, moaning and bewailing her crime.
In , the cellar the policeman found Dan
iels' body, propped up against a dirt bufk
head. > â 
Mrs. Coarum was arrested and charged
with murder. She pleaded self-defense
and the Jury convicted â¢â¢ her of. man
slaughter.
When Bha appeared for sentence yester
day she was very much- excited and
asked the court for permission to say a
few words.- - - - -
Judge : Dunne . gave her permission to
talk, and she said:
"I had to ' do what I did to that man.
I: was driven' to it and had to defend my
self and my home. I never troubled that
man at all and would not have hurt him
if he had let me alone. He had been
running around my home, Judge, month
after month, and that night he got me
down on the ' stairs and held me down
and threatened to cut my throat with the
razor. What could I do? What would
any woman have done in a place like
that? I had to do what I did. If I had
not donÂ© . It, my husband would have
come home and found me murdered.
"Strong men arm themselves and go
out and look for their victims and shoot
them down dead â shoot them in cold
bloodâ and the law lets them off; but I,
a poor, helpless woman, compelled to act
In .defense of my home and my life, am
convicted. Where is the Justice of that?
It isn't right, Judge. That man would
have killed me if I had not done what I
did."
Mrs. Coarum, after finishing her speech,
sank back Into her chair and gazed
straight at the Judge.
See Ho Mon, a Chinaman convicted of
manslaughter, was sentenced by Judge
Dunne to servo nine years In State. Prison.
The Celestial and the woman were
taken from the courtroom together.
Mrs. Coarum shot a last glance at the
Judge and said:
"Humph! This Is a pretty countryâ
a white woman gets ten years for man
slaughter and a Chinaman gets nine."

EMPLOYES TALK
OF PROMOTIONS
Colonel Gray Likely to
Be New, Wells-Pargo
President.
Directors Probably Will Not
Meet Until Late in
the Week.
Although the directors of the Wella-
Fargo Company probably â¢will not meet
until late In the week to decide upon a
successor to the late president, John J.
Valentine, there is already much specula
tion as to what their action will be. It Is
generally expected that Colonel George E.
Gray, first vice president, will be pro
moted to the presidency, but as to other
changes there are radical differences of
opinions. Â«
In the Wells-Fargo offices the general
supposition is that there will be promo
tions all along the line. The employes
mostly believe that a local man, probably
a department manager, will be advanced
to the first vice presidency, and that in
consequence numerous promotions will
fall to the lot of the men In the depart
ment so fortunate as to have Its manager
honored with promotion.
Men who have studied the condition of
the directorate do not agree with the pre
dictions of the men In the offices. They
say'that Colonel Gray very probably will
be advanced to the presidency, and that
the second vice president, Colonel Dudley
Evans, also the New York manager, prob
ably will bo made first vice president. The
second vice president must be chosen
from the members of the board of dl
rectors, and the man most likely, to be
chosen Is Homer S. King, manager of the
Wells, Fargo & Co. Bank.
Of 'the eight surviving members of the
board of directors six are In San Fran
cisco at present. They are Colonel Georga
B. Gray, Homer S. King, Captain John
Bermingham, Captain Oliver Eldridge,
Andrew Christeson, manager of the Pa
cific department, and Colonel Dudley
Evans, who, though the New York man
ager, is at present in this city. The other
two members, H. E. Huntington and John
J. McCook, are both in the East.
A successor to John J. Valentine on ths
board of directors will be chosen before
the vacancy in the office is filled. The
president and vice presidents must all be
members of the board of directors.
It is possible that if Colonel Evans be
made 'first vice president a new manager
for the New York office may be chosen,
and in that case numerous local promo
tions will follow.
> Colonel Gray, who seems likely to be
made president, has been with the com
pany for twenty years, and for nearly ten
years he has been first vice president.
During the past year, since the beginning
of President Valentine's illness, he has
been acting president. He is one of the
best known and most highly respected of
San Francisco business men, and his pro
motion will give general satisfaction.
CORONA LITERACY CLTJB
DEBATES ON CHARACTER
The Madonna in Axt and Collection of
Madonnas a Feature of Next
Meeting.
At the last session of the Corona Liter
ary Club of the Mission there was an in
teresting debate upon the subject "thai
heredity is more influential than envi
ronment on the moral and Intellectual
character of man."- Miss Partridge and
Miss Cole spoke In the affirmative, and
Mrs. Frank Dalton and Mrs. Grace Part
ridge Hays in the negative. The debate
gave rise to a spirited discussion, In which
many of the ladies took part. Two votes
were taken,; on the debate itself and the
question, both resulting in a close victory
for the affirmative side.
This was one of a series of debates that
the club has arranged for the winter.
Mrs. A. L. Barry is conducting a series
of parliamentary drills with much ability
and gjiccess. At the next meeting a loan
collection of Madonnas will be exhibited,
and Mrs. George Hanson will read a paper
on the Madonnas in art. Mrs. L. R. Tut
tle will present a paper on the architec
ture of the renaissance.
A "Unique Gift.
A Government bond is supposed to be
about as good a thing as you can give
for a Christmas remembrance. Here is
something, however, quite as good as a
Government bond, and it does not cost so
much money. It is a most unique idea for
a gift, yet most practical, and solves the
problem of what to give in a most satis
factory manner.
A pair of fins shoes or a dainty pair of
slippers is a gift acceptable to all. Yet
it Is impossible to make this gift ordinar
ily, without giving away the secret. One
must know the size and other necessary
details. But the Sorosis shoe people have
solved the problem. They are issuing a
certificate which you can send in lieu of
the gift, and the happy recipient can go
and pick out her own shoes or slippers.
This certificate is good in any part of the
country where there is a Sorosis store. So
If you want to send such a gift to any one
you can purchase the certificate here at
their store, The Royal, 50 Third street,
slip It Into a letter, and the shoes will be
forthcoming at the other end when it is
presented.
It is an Ideal method to secure an ideal
gift, for the Sorosis shoe is a favorite
with well dressed women from the At
lantic to the Pacific. Its merits are so
well known they need no telllngj and few
gifts would be more acceptable. -
Boys Play the Deafmute Role.
James Harrison and John Morrison,
boys of 16 and 17 years, respectively, ap
peared before Judge Fritz yesterday on
a charge of begging. They were arrested
at Fifth and Market streets Friday night,
as they had been annoying people there
for some nights soliciting money with the
aid of cards on which were printed the
story that they were "deaf mutes." Both
could hear and talk as well as the gen
eral run of boys, and they told the Judge
they had arrived from Portland recently
and hit upon the scheme of soliciting
money with the printed cards. The Judge
sent them to the Boys' and Girls' Aid So

PARASITE TAKES

Attacks the Boss Scale
and Surprises
Experts.
Has Done Splendid Service
in Destroying the Yel
low Pest.
During the inspection of an orange tree
recently Experts Drummond and Jeffrey
of the Board of Horticultural Commis
sioners of Los Angeles discovered that
it was Infected with aspldlotus rossi (Ross
scale). Their attention was attracted by
what seemed to be the exit holes of some
parasite in a number of scales. A sam
ple was forthwith sent to Alexander
Craw,, the entomologist of the State
Board of Horticulture, in this city, for
investigation, who has determined that
the small parasite belongs to the chalcld
group of hymenopterous insects, aspld
iotophagus citrlnus, or scale killer, that
was so effective in checking the yellow
scale of the orange a few years ago. The
parasite is almost microscopic and on
that account is frequently overlooked by
orchardists. The fact remains that it has
suddenly and strangely appeared lnÂ» a dif
ferent scale to the one in which it is the
true parasite, and there ia no doubt
that it will be of great benefit in checking
the Increase of the Ross scale (aspidiotua
rossl). The history of the parasite is In
teresting, Inasmuch as it belongs to' a
class of insects that can never become
a pest. Its Btomach and whole anatomy
are such that it cannot digest vegetable
foods, in fact It is such an epicure that it
seldom attacks other scales than the one
of which it is parasitical. As an Instance
of this. It has refused to attack the red
scale of the orange, yet the structural dif
ference of the yellow and red scale can
hardly be determined by xhe most power
ful microscope. The parasite, therefore,
Is keener even than the most scientific re
searchers In readily distinguishing be
tween the two species. It came into prom
inence in 1891, when Cra-w described the
parasite which is of such interest to the
orange grower, under the name of cocco
phagus citrinus, but now and henceforth
it is to be known as aspldiotophagus cit
rinus (scale killer).
It has done yeoman service in stamping
out the yellow scale in Los Angeles, San
Bernardino and Riverside counties.
The results of Its introduction In Yuba
County has also been eminently success
ful. Entomologist Craw has also under
inspection . and is propagating the new
Chinese parasite of the red scale, sixteen
hundred of which have been sent to Los
Angeles and the orange counties. He is
breeding the insect from Â« a Chinese
orange tree sent him by Mr. Compere
from China. The results of the investiga
tion are being looked forward to with
great Interest.

KNOWLTON'S
FATE HANGS
IN BALANCE
School Board Listens to
Testimony of .Three
Witnesses.
Extreme Bitterness Is Shown
by Oasserly During
Examination. '
Comical Incidents Mark the Closing
Day of the Inquiry Into the
Veteran. Teacher's Com
petency.
The culminating act In the Investigation
of the charges of lncompetency against
Professor Ebenezer Knowlton by the
Board of Education proved to be a gen
uine farce comedy yesterday. Principal
Lyser of the John Swett Grammar
School, who preferred the charges, was
present at the investigation evidently by
appointment with Director Casserjy, who
is acting in the capacity of counsel for
the prosecution and Judge of the trial
court. That the court is biased against
Knowlton is evidenced by the manner In
which the proceedings were conducted
from the commencement of the hearing-.
When the matter, was called yesterday
afternoon Attorney McPlke, counsel for
Knowlton, announced that his client
waived the privilege of calling upon the
pupils of the Everett School to testify in
his behalf. McPike said he might have
called upon Judge Sloss, Assessor Dodge
and other prominent men who were pupils
of Knowlton at one time and who were
ready to testify as to his efficiency. But
he understood that the board had an
nounced its willingness to admit all these
gentlemen would testify to in that con
nection.
Chairman Casserly denied that this ad
mission had ever been made In the pro-*
ceedings. The testimony was read by the
reporter, but nothing bearing upon the
matter at issue could be found. McPike
insisted that the proceedings in which
the admission was made were not read,
and Casserly triumphantly announced
that McPike was wrong. The matter was
then passed.
Lyser Called in Rebuttal.
"That's our case," s&id McPike.
Casserly assumed to be surprised at
this announcement and then called Lyser
In rebuttal. . Casserly proceeded to ex
amine Lyser . upon matters which were
not hinted at by the defense on his direct
examination and McPike entered a pro
test. Casserly pompously overruled the
attorney's objection, with the announce
ment that he would allow, him an .excep
tion. ' -. ... '. . â - â¢.. â¢â¢. h -
"Your Honor is' very kind," replied Mc-
Pike sarcastically. "If you will tell me
what higher court is to pass upon the
exceptions you may be good enough to
allow me I will be pleased to take ad
vantage of your generous offer."
Casserly whispered with Mrs. Klncaid,
and after a brief consultation he said he
would examine Lyser in his own way,
and he proceeded to carry out his inten
tion In a characteristic manner. He drew
out Lyser's story in fragments as It suit
ed his convenience, and if Lyser sought
to explain himself Casserly shut him off
remorselessly. Casserly dwelt with ap
parent delight upon every point made
against Knowlton and each reply to hia
questions was repeated by him with the
air of one who was surprised that such
frightful incompetency as Knowlton dis
played could have been tolerated in the
School Department for so many years.
In his examination Lyser evinced much
bitterness of feeling against Knowlton,
and his eagerness to parade the short
comings of the veteran educator was
shown in the Irrelevant and ungram
matlcal verbosity with which he enter
tained the board and spectators.
"Give us specific illustrations of Knowl
ton's incompetency," said Director Den
man in the course of Lyser's lecture upon
the best methods of educating the young.
; , "Well," replied Lyser musingly, "he
never followed the law of mental associ
ation â "
"What's that?" interrupted McPike in
surprise.
"Let the witness proceed!" said Casser
ly severely.
"Yes, sir," resumed Lyser dreamily, "he
lacked the faculty of what Herbert calls
apperception."
"Precisely," remarked Casserly tri
umphantly. "He lackedâ lackedâ pro
ceed, sir."
Stocks Are Discussed.
LyEer told of a conversation with
Knowlton in which the latter admitted
that he did not thoroughly understand the
svbject of stocks upon which his pupils
were examined one day. The result was
that 75 per cant of the pupils failed to
properly answer a question put to them
relative to a stock transaction.
"Ah, yes," interjected Casserly. "Stocks
aiG queer things. Some days they are up
and some days they are down."
This wise observation lost Its force
when McPike began his cross-examina
tion of Lyser. . It then developed that the
question alluded to was so ambiguous that
the pupils could not answer it without
first applying" for a diagram to Lyser,
who, as principal, had framed it. Lyser
made one or two damaging admissions in
tho course of his examination by McPike,
one being that under the present system
of education in this city It was possible
for a teacher to work Indefinitely without
doir:g an honest day's work.
"â¢I don't see what this has to do with
Knowlton's competency," said Casserly
petulantly.
"You have charged," said McPike of
the witness, "that Knowlton talks too
much. You do a little talking yourself,
don't you?"
"Sometimes," was tho answer.
Casserly bobbed up with a strong objec
tion to. this line of questioning and he
administered a severe rebuke to the at
torney, who Insisted that he was acting
within his legal scope. McPike then asked
Lyser if it was not true that nine teach
ers for one class were employed at the
Swett school within 'a period of two
menths, to which the witness replied In
the affirmative.
Casserly Again Objects.
"That is a matter of record," said Cas
serly. "There is no use going over that
giound." i
"I choose to do so," replied McPike
firmly. "I will say here that under the
circumstances It Is strange that Knowl
ton, who was In charge of one class two
months, should be tried for Incompetency
when there is testimony here that nine
teachers were employed to teach one class
for a similar period."
"That's Irrelevant, incompetent and im
material." answered Casserly, coldly.
"Isn't it a fact that seven of the nlnÂ©
pupils who testified In behalf of Knowlton
GEORGE H. PIPPY'S NAME HEADS
TICKET FOR NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE UNION LEAGUE CLUB
Nominating Committee, of Organization, Consisting
of Well-Known Republicans, Puts Forward Com
plete List of Those Who May Serve as Directors
THE nominating committee of the
Union League Club met yesterday
afternoon and placed Colonel
George H. PIppy on the regular
â  ; ticket for the next president of
the League. Other nominations were made
as follows:
D. McKinlay, first vice president; S. G.
Hendy, second vice president; I. W. Hell
man Jr., treasurer: J. B. Fuller, . secre
tary; directors, W. M. Abbott, F. M. An
gellottl. H. G. W. Dinkelspeil, A. 3.-Man
grum, E. J. Smith and O. F. Westphal.
The election will take, place Januarys
There are no signs of an opposition ticket.
Colonel Pippy Is a well-known National
Guard officer, now serving on the Ftaff of
the commander in chief. He Is active in
club affairs and If elected will have the
honor of participating prominently In the
State political campaign next fall. If
President Roosevelt visits California next
summer the glad hand of Colonel Plppy
wlll^go out to him. The League's nom
inating-committee, consists of the follow
ing named:
J. B. Fuller, C. H. Garoutte, J. H. Neff,
In this investigation have failed of pro
motion since they so testified?" asked Mc-
Pike.
"The record In the office of the clerk
of the board will answer that question."
said Casserly before the witness could re
ply. "That will do, Lyser."
Mrs. Clara J. Blgelow, a teacher in the
John Swett School, was called by Cas
serly to explain why certain examination
papers were marked and the markings
subsequently changed.
Question Was Ambiguous.
"One of the questions relating to bonds
was ambiguous," replied Mrs. Bigelow.
"I called Mr. Lyser's attention to the
question and answers thereto and the
markings were changed in justice to the
pupils themselves."
The testimony was evidently not satis
factory to Casserly and the witness was
soon excused. Miss Sophia Hobe. a
teacher in the same school, was then
called. She said that she taught Knowl
ton's class and observed that pupils
lacked discipline. They were also guilty
of the crime of whispering. It developed
that the witness had followed another
teacher of the same class, and after
considerable objection by Casserly sho
said, in reply to a question by Director
Mark, that the bad conduct complained
of in Knowlton's pupils showed little
change for the better under other teach
ers.
"How long have you been a teacher,
Miss Hobe?" inquired McPike.
"Twenty-five years.".
"Was the rule requiring teachers to be
18 years of age then In force?"
"Oh, yes. I was 18 then," replied Miss
Hobe innocently.
"That la all." . .
"It's a shame to reveal a woman's age
in that manner," growled Casserly.
"Thank you very much. Miss Hobe." '
McPike announced that he had no fur
ther witnesses and he asked time In
'which to argue his client's case. Casserly
graciously accorded this privilege and set
the time for hearing argument at 9
o'clock to-morrow morning.

âVerdict of Coroner's Jury
San Lucas inquest.
SAN LUCAS, Dec. 2Lâ This afternoon
some pathetic scenes were observed dur
ing the continuation of the Inquest over
the remains of Garland and Thurber, vic
tims of the collision at Upland.
Charles F. Hicks, messenger's helper on
train No. 10, related his experiences. HÂ»
was asleep, he said, in one of the cars
used for express purposes when he was
suddenly awakened by being violently
hurled to the floor of the car. HÂ« was
covered by express matter and baggage.
Fortunately he had all his clothes on and
went outside to see where the train was.
He discovered the* mall car ahead turned
over on its side and ran at once- toward
it and helped out two mail clerks. He
then went toward train No. 9 and found
the express car Jumbled up with the en
gine. The witness hers broke down and
with trembling voice haltingly continued
his story of seeing the express car of No.
9 in flames and of how Colby, the mes
senger, and Martin, the "guard, were
dragged from their car, Colby calling for
Thurber, but receiving no response. A
vain search was made through the burn
ing car for Thurber in the hope of find
ing him still alive. Hicks told how he
watched the car burn completely up and
said he then became suddenly oblivious
to everything till he found himself help
ing rescue others from the train.
Hicks related how he had found what
remained of Thurber, only a few bones
mixed up in a pile of bullion, formerly
$125,000 Mexican coin, stove remnants and
other materials. He heard agonizing cries
from other cars as though from people in
them.
Engineer Coffey's deposition, which was
read to the jurors, was continued. His
answers were as follows:
I received my orders at San Ardo, Decem
ber 19. 1001, statin? that "trains numbers 9
and 10 will meet at Uplands." Conductor Wil
liams read them to me. "We left San Ardo at
12:55 a. m. I was on the right slda of tha
cab. Changed my position aa often as duty
required. Was tending to different duties. Did
not see Uplands lights. Did not know I was
there until we were over the switch. Don't
know how far away the train was when I saw
the light first. Did all I could to prevent tha
collision after passing the switch when I real
ized I had passed it. I put on the brakes and
slowed steam. I compared watches wfth my
fireman at 1:01 a. m., when I told him, of
orders.
This closed the testimony. After being
satisfied that the bones had been those of
a human being the jury retired to delib
erate. After two hours' deliberation thÂ«
jury returned the following verdict:
Case of O. A.' Thurber: That he came to his
death by being burned in express car attached
to train No. 9 in collision with train No. 10 at
siding called uplands, flvo miles east of San Lu
cas, Cal.. on the Coast Division of the South
ern Pacific Company; that his death was Ant
to the disobedience of train orders given Engi
neer Coftey of train No. 9. That case of. Wil
liam C. Garland or Grieves, fireman, on train
No. 10. was exactly similar, except that death;
was caused by being crushed beneath aa en
gine tender. - â 
Two sisters of Thurber arrived here thiÂ«
evening, but were not permitted to view
the remains.
WORTHINGTON INVESTIGATES.
Superintendent "Worthlngton of the coast
division of the Southern Pacific held an
investigation yesterday morning as to the
circumstances of the wreck at Upland.
The testimony will be transcribed at once
and together with the recommendations
of Mr. "Worthington will be submitted to
Manager Agler to-mcrrow.
The members of the two train- crews
were present with the exception of En
gineer Coffey, who was not able to leave
his bed. A statement by him was filed as
part of the evidence. Nothing new was
developed, and in the main the members
: of the crews , agreed as to facts. There
were discrepancies, however, between the
testimony cf Engineer Coffey, Fireman
Dameron and Conductor 'Williams of No.
9. Each of them claimed to have set t'.ie
emergency brakes when the danger was
first discovered. Coffey and Dameron
each claimed also to have closed the
throttle.
The wreckage has practically all been
cleared away and trains are running over
tha old track again. The wrecked engines
will probably be brought to the San Fran
cisco shops to-day.
No other human remains were found in
the wreckage, and the total of five la the
sum of lives lost in the disaster, the vic
tims being William C. Garland, fireman
of No. 10; Owen A. Thurber, Wells-Fargo
messenger helper; Cordona and Sava

unknown boy or man, supposed to have
been a tramp riding on the brake beam.

ANOTHER SPREAD-EAGLE VICTORY FOR CRUZADOS IN THE JUNIOR STAKES AT OAKLAND
NATIONALS WIN
BY ONE TALLY
Mertes Is Credited With
Only Run Made in
the Game.
Whalen and Schmidt Given
Superb Fielding
Support.
The Wasps and the Nationals gave a
clever exhibition of fast, snappy baseball
yesterday at Recreation Park. "Sandow"
Mertes was the only player to make a
complete circuit of the bases, although in
several innings it was only sharp fielding
that prevented a larger score.
Mertes' run was scored in the Nation
als' last time at the bat. He was sent to
first on called balls. Chance, the next
batsman up, hit a slow one to Krug. The
latter waited for it to reach him, instead
of going after it. The best he could do
was to shut off the batsman at first,
Mertes reaching third on the play. Lee
flew to Hildebrand in left field. â¢'Hilde"
misjudged the flight of the ball and finally
let it paes through his hands. Mertes
strolled home.
Mertes made the only errors charged
against the visitors, but neither were se
rious, as the side was retired before any
harm was done.
In the sixth inning Van Haltren showed
he still retained his throwing arm, putting
out Shay at the plate from deep center
field. Shay was running for Hildebrand,
who had to retire from the field to effect
temporary repairs to his knickerbockers,
which were damaged in a long-distance
slide to second. This was the nearest the
home team was to scoring.
In the fifth inning Whalen was called
out at first on a double play. The specta
tors thought he was safe. "Jake" Beck
ley was playing first, and as the ball
reached him he shouted "Three out!" and
left the field. Umpire McDonald was ap
parently caught off his guard, as he let
it go at that.
In the game to be played this afternoon
Lee, Washington's southpaw twirler, will
be in the box for the Nationals. Iburg
â will twirl for the home team. Yesterday's
score:

IMPERIAL WINS
AT GOOD ODDS
Beats Fast Lady Clare
Pointless in Short
Course.
Sir Pasha Is Favorite in
Union Park Special
Stake.
W. Cairns' greyhound Imperial gave
the talent a distressed feeling iir the run
down of the open stake at Union Cours
ing Park yesterday by winning the flag
from D. J. Healey's fast courier, Lady
Clare. The wise, ones had figured the
Petaluma greyhound had so much speed
over her opponent that unless the hare
proved a demon It was easy money for
the Lady to â¢win. - At slip time their con
fidence had increased to the extent that
the knowing ones were freely offering S
to 1 that honors in the course would go
to their choice. The tempting odds had
the desired effect and quite a number of
tickets were issued at that price. The
capitalists were given a short and sweet
run for their money. Almost before they
got a glance at their favorite on the field
the white flag went up and they learned
that Lady Clare had been retired from
the stake. Imperial took the lead and
maintaining it scored a running pick-up
and gained the decision.
Loyal Lad also proved a bad investment
for the men of money. . Five to one was
quoted on his chances and a good play
was recorded. Daisy Clalr, his opponent
in the course, outworked him for the flag
by a score of 6 to 4.
Dorothy M beat her sister, Miss Brum
mel, a 1 to 5 choice, and three other short
ends, each at 3 to 5, completed the list
of victories for the pikers. The imported
Bright Gold, one of the short ends, after
being unsighted joined in and outworked
Patriot in a good course.
The hares were not so lively as previ
ous lots', but ' at that set a pace strong
enough to make the hounds extend them
selvess.
Sir Pasha is stake favorite at 4 to 1, but
his ability to go through a seven-round
stake is questioned. Rural Artist and
Freda C are at 5 to 1; For Glory, Lottie
M. Master Clair, Black Flush and The
Grafter at 7 to L
Second round winners look to be Minnie
Sankey, Freda C, Elista, Sir Pasha,
Naughty Girl, The Grafter, Ruby San
key, Greenhall. St. Ives. Tapioca, Hick
ory Dick, Kibosh, Black. Flush, Wedding
Bells, Master Clair, Bowery Boy, Sofala,
Red Rock, Ben Lomond, Rural Artist.
In the special stake to be run to-day
Charta and Narcissus are even favorites
at 4 to 1 for final honors. Narcissus
should have the call, having won his last
three stakes In fast company. Tiburon
and Freeze Out are at 5 to 1. Tiburon may
be beaten by Fly by Night in his first
course. In his last time out Healey's dog
was outworked by Wedding Bells, which
fell an easy victim to Fly by Night.

THERE were two or three special
features that served to attract
a large and fashionable attend
ance to Oakland track yesterday.
The match race between Old
England and San Nicholas apparently
touched a popular chord, and then too
the sensational Cruzados was to start In
the Junior stake for two-year-olds.
"Lucky" Baldwin, the silver haired
maistre of Santa Anita ranch, had Jour
neyed all the way from Southern Califor
nia to see his greatly talked about colt
run, and it is likely the local public has
seen the last' of Cruzados for some time.
Before the race his owner said that If
Emperor of Norfolk's son proved success
ful he would not be starred again here,
but would be retired temporarily and
specially prepared for the Derby of 1302
at Chicago. Meeting only an ordinary
field in the stake, which was over seven
furlongs, it looked just a question as to
whether he could go a route or not. The
ring took a chance, and coupled with his
stable mate Escalante, as good as 4 jto 5
could be obtained about the Baldwin pair.
Under the conditions Cruzados. had to
carry 121 pounds. At the start he went
away In the lead with Ransom, stepping
off the first half in HYa seconds, the three
quarters in 1:13% and finished the distance
practically eased up nearly three lengths
before Botany in 1:26 flat. Escalante, not
such a poor piefce of racing hardwaro
himself, grew dizzy chasing the winner,
ending up among the tall enders. The
gross value of the stake was $1500, of
which amount $1200 went to the first
horse. Botany, piloted by Mounce and
1^ to 1 in the ring, ran a remarkably good
race and gives promise of becoming a
clever three-year-old.
No fault could be found with the cli
matic conditions. The weather was warm
and pleasant and the track lightning fast.
Still, only two favorites managed to take
purses.
In the match race Old England settled

once and for all that he is the superior
of San Nicholas. In the betting the big

Ing the Burns & Waterhouse colors, could

inside position and led San Nicholas a head
the flrst^quarter, traveled in :22%. There
was no slackening up In speed, the half
being reeled off In 46^4 seconds, and then
San Nicholas "cracked," despite Spencer's
urging. Old England finished the five
furlongs out In :59%, under close reefed
Bails, three lengths to the good.
There seemed no end to the meritorious
performances. In the six furlong handi
cap Headwater, with Buchanan In the
saddle and 10 to 1 in the betting, nipped
Sombrero, the two-year-old, a scant head
en the wire. The winner's time, 1:12%,
marks a new California record. â¢ Mercer,
carrying 107 pounds, had the call, but did
not get away from the post well. Som
brero, away on the fly, made all the pace
and had Lee Jackson refrained from look
ing behind, would unquestionably have
won. Meehanus seems to have gone
back.
Cousin Carrie, a 10 to 1 shot, with Hoar
in the saddle, led from start to finish fn
the introductory sprint. Afghan, the entry
of "Frisco" Llnd, enjoyed a slight call
In the betting around post time, and in
a fierce drive just lasted long enough to
beat Rio Shannon a nose for the place.
Jockey Hoar also landed, the second
purse with St. Philllplna, which filly was
never headed in the five and a half fur
long sprint for two-year-olds. The St.
Carlo filly possessed all sorts of speed,
and although she had nothing- left at the
wire, led Dr. Scharff out three lengths
In 1:07. Mounce took Shell Mount too far
out of It, getting up In time to finish third,
Jarretlere d'Or, the favorite, died away to

MAY MATCH ROOT
WITH GARDNER
Lowell Boxer Is Highly
Thought of by Ring
Patrons.
Few Middle weights Are Ex
pected to "Want His
Game.
Boxers George Gardner and Kid Carter
were about town yesterday" apparently
little the worse for their meeting the
night before In Mechanics' Pavilion.
Gardner bore no sign of the encounter,
while Carter's face will soon regain Its
normal size. The former went to the
races yesterday and was the subject of
congratulation on all sides.
If the San Francisco Athletic Club can
secure a license next month an effort will
be made to bring Gardner and Jack Hoot
of Chicago together. The Lowell boxer. In
his present form, seems invincible.
The total receipts on Friday night were
$5300. Of this Gardner received $1603 and
Carter $650. The Twentieth Century Ath
letic Club officials received $1000 as their
share of the receipts. This was in ac
cordance with an agreement entered Into
when negotiations were pending for the
Jeffries-Ruhlin fight. At that time the
representatives of the two clubs agreed
not to bid against one another.
The- Twentieth Century people were to
be the sole bidders for the Sght and the
San Francisco Club people were to share
in the profits. In return they agreed to
promote a second heavyweight contest In
December and the Twentieth Century peo
ple were to share their profits. The Jef
frles-Ruhlln fiasco upset these plans, as
it was seen the public would not patron
ize the proposed Jeffries-Sharkey fight-
Pressure was brought to bear on Alex
Greggains, but he -.stood on the side of
the people and insisted on a good fight
being provided. ' He carried the day and
the meeting of Gardner and Carter was
the result.
The San Francisco Club's. share of the
Jeffries-Ruhlln gate money was $3100. The
club has made a profit on the year's
rights and will apparently be the biggest
factor in the game In this city next year.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by S. A. Clark against Alice C. Clark for
cruelty and Jacob Klotz against Rachel
Klotz for desertion.
YOUNG HORSES
FOR SALES RING
Royally Bred Trotters
to Represent Aptos
Stock Farm.
Wonderful Success of the
Products of This Estab
lishment
The representatives of the Apios
Stock farm are already preparing the
trotting horses bred at this noted
Santa Crua County establishment for
' the Blue Ribbon pale at Cleveland In
May. Twenty-two head of royally bred
youngsters will be taken In hand within
the next few weeks and given such work
as will transform them Into trotters for
the Grand Circuit or the Park speedway.
A. B. Spreckels has the breeding and
development of the Aptos horses under
his personal direction and the results he
has obtained show how successful he has
been both in theory and practice. Ha
shares with C. J. Hamlln the honor
of having bred two mares with rec
ords better than 2:10. No other man
holds such a record. Mr. Spreckels bred
at Aptos the mares Dione, 2:07%, and
Hulda, 2:08%. Mr. Hamlin bred Fantasy.
2:06, and Nightingale, 2:08. <
At Aptos' Farm are three trotting
bred stallions â Dexter Prince, Cupt.i
and Aptoa "Wilkes. It Is their pro
geny which will bÂ« sold in May.
Dexter Prince is the sire of Eleata, 2:0S?i,
winner of the classic "M and M" stake
this year and winner of most money on
the Grand Circuit,
. Cupid Is the sire of Venus n, 2:11%;
Ps> che, 2:16%, and Lottie Parka, 2:16%.
These three are the only ones of his
progeny to face a starter. â¢
Aptos Wilkes is not represented InjhÂ»
list of producing sires, but so many^of
his get have sold for large figures, to bo
used as park horses, that his reputation
is more than local. ' '
â  Mr. Spreckels has bred horses for
the pleasure it affords and not for the
profit to be obtained. His youngsters,
whether runners or trotters, have all been
well nourished and well raised. His last
consignment of thoroughbred yearlings,
sold In New York, seemed as big as two
year-olds and were pronounced in better
condition than those of any consignment
sold during the past year. The trotters
will have the same care and they should
all be perfect representatives of tha
American light harness horse.NEWS OF THE BAY CITIES

CLAIMS PART OF MILLIONS FOR WHICH
LILLIAN NORDICA HAS MADE DEMAND
Oakland Saleswoman Says She Is Direct Descendant of Ichabod Norton,
the Continental Ship Owner, Who Lost Through Depredations of French
Privateers, for Which Indemnity Was Collected by United States
OAKLAND, Dec. 21.â Mrs. Virginia
C Norton, a saleswoman in W.
B. Standeford's Seventh-street
candy shop, is a claimant for a
portion of the millions which werj
paid to the United States Government as
indemnity for the destruction of Ameri
can merchant vessels by French priva
teers in 1799. Mrs. Xorton is a half
cousin of Madame Lillian Nordlca, the
rrand opera diva, who, as a relative of
Ichabod Norton, the continental ship
owner who lost through the energy of
the- French privateersmen, recently filed a
claim in Washington through Thomas B.
Reed.
But Mrs. Norton of Oakland, who has
retained Attorney Clinton tS. Dodge to
press her demands, declares that she Is
of closer relationship to Ichabod Xorton
than is the celebrated singer.
It was through the publicity given to
Madame Nordica's move upon the French
spoliation Indemnity that Mrs. Norton de
cided to begin a. fis-ht for a share of the
millions.
Woven about this old story of conti
nental days Is an Interesting narrative,
Freplete with romance of the sea, and the
preservation for more than a hundred
years of the record â¢which, it Is hoped by
the Oakland candy girl, will reap a for
tune for her.
SAYS CONTRACT
WAS ABROGATED

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Dec. 21.
A suit that Involves the performance
of a specific contract or the payment of
J1W.00J in lieu thereof was begun to-day
by the Piedmont Bath and Power Com
pany against the Piedmont and Mountain
View Railway and the Oakland Transit
Company. Heretofore the baths and the
TJ^road were thought to have been work
ing harmoniously for their own financial
benefit, but the suit not only discloses that
they have been pursuing their separate
ways, but that a stubborn war has been
C f "*ng on fÂ° r some time.
Briefly, according to the complaint, the
bath company sues the railway companies
for failure to live up to the terms of a
ADVEBTISEKCZNTS.

Ichabod Norton was one of the many
ship owners . of New England who suf
fered from the activity of the tricolor
privateersmen during the troubles be
tween France and the new republic fol
lowing the Revolution. When France In
1S03 paid over to the United States some
520,000,000 in settlement of numerous
claims a number of the sufferers received
compensation. Ship Owner Norton was
a heavy loser, but the record Ehows he
did not benefit by the indemnity.
His grandnephew, Thomas B. Norton of
Plainsburg. Merced County, who Is now
more than 66 years old, learned of
Madame Nordica's move and decided to
follow buIL The diva is a grandniece of
Ichabod Norton.
On account of his years the Californlan
claimant has assigned all of his interests
to his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Norton of
this city. The transfer was made to-day,
and the preparation of the papers to be
filed with the United States Court of
Claims has been commenced.
The Norton claim now amounts to about
$2,000,000. Mrs. Norton is a widow, and
eince her husband's death has been a
saleswoman in Standeford's candy store:
Ichabod Norton figures as her great
granduncle-ln-law.
"I have placed all of the papers in At
torney Dodge's hands," she said, "and
certain contract for the supply of salt and
fresh water and power.
The contract was entered into before the
Piedmont and Mountain View Railway
was absorbed by the Oakland Transit
Company, though It was continued a short
time by the latter corporation. The agree
ment entered Into obligated the railway
companies to furnish for a period of fif
teen years as much salt water as will be
be required by the bath company to fill
its swimmine tanks and as much steam
as is needed to heat the water and supply
the steam baths. The salt water was to
be pumped from Lake Menitt or beyond
the Twelfth-street dam from the estuary
by means of power furnished by the rail
way company.
Another part of the agreement includes
an obligation to supply power to pump
fresh water from a well on land
near the power-house, and In the event
of Its efficiency and it becoming: necessary
to purchase water from another company
the railway company must pay two-fifths
of the cost thus incurred. For this ser
vice the bath company agreed to pay $5 a
month. . -
The agreement was entered into April
1, 1KÂ»5, having appended to It the signa-r
tures of Charles P. Bishop, president of
the Piedmont and Mountain View Rail
way, and Ira Bishop, president of the
Piedmont Baths and Power Company. The
name of Daniel Grant is signed as secre
tary of both companies, showing the close
relationship between the two corporations.
About July 14. 189Â»-just after the Pied
mont road was absorbed by the Transit
Company â the contract was arbitrarily
abrogated, so the plaintiffs allege. The
railway company refused to further fur
nish power or heat or water according to
agreement, and particularly declined to
pay Its portion of the purchase price of
fresh water.
By reason of the failure of the defend
ants to carry out their obligations . the
plaintiffs allege that the baths upon
which they have expended $150,000 have
been rendered valueless. To compensate
for this alleged loss the plaintiffs demand
that the defendants be required either to
abide by the terms of the agreement or
pay $100,000 in damages.

funeral observance will be as closely in
keeping with the known desires of Mr.

received at the Valentine residence In
East Oakland. From far and near are
telegraphed the sympathetic words of sor
row which is felt all along the lines cf the
great company of which President Valen
tine was the head.
Many there are who will miss the
beneficent hand, for ypon Mr. Valentine'a
private liBt of patrons were many who

are many who have reason to know ex

George Valentine. The children of the

MRS. WILLIAMS
GETS DIVORCE
Husband Allows Wife's
Suit to Go Without
Contest.
Judge Hall. Awards Custody
.of Two Miner Children
to the Mother.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec 21.
Mrs. Clare Tucker Williams, whose high
social connections in Oakland and San
Francisco caused her application for a
divorce from her husband to' be given
wide publicity six days ago, was freed
from the matrimonial i ties to-day by
Judge Hall. Neither her husband. Philip
A. Williams, the well known clubman,
nor his attorneys, Stratton & Kaufman,
were present to oppose the young wife in
any way. She. did not ask for alimony,
presumably because her husband would
not have been "able to pay it if she re
ceived the "necessary award, and she got
all she askedâ an absolute separation and
the custody of the two minor children.
The testimony of the witnesses in Mrs.
Williams' behalf was brief. She was the
first to take the stand. In answer to the
questions of her attorney, George E. de
Golia. she said that her husband was an
excessive drinker, and. that when he was
intoxicated he became abusive and de
structive. Once, she remembered, his
conduct was particularly mortifying.
They were traveling across the continent
and her husband attracted great atten
tion to himself by pounding on the door
of the car for admittance, the precaution
having been taken to bar him out be
cause of his habits.
Mrs. Williams said that her husband
had more than once threatened to i kill
her. He came home from San Francisco
one night when ho was in an ugly mood
armed with a shotgun, with which he
said he proposed to kill everybody that
came in his way.
The testimony of Mrs. M. H. Tucker,
mother of Mrs. Williams, was corrobora
tive of that of her daughter. She related
several circumstances in the clubman's
career that showed him to be anything
but a good husband. She was a witness
of some of his alcoholic seances.
Another witness was C. F. Williams, a
professional nurse, who took care of his
namesake whenever he was unable to
take care of himself. He told about the
gun episode, where Williams went on a
tour of extermination, and said that ho
took tho cartridges out of the weapon
for fear that he might attempt to carry
ou his threats. Tho witness also told of
a fight he had .with Williams, who Btruck
him one day while he was not looking.
He returned the blow by knocking his
patient down.
Judge Hall asked Mrs. Williams if she
had made any agreement with her hus
band to secure a divorce. She replied that
she had not, adding that she had not seen
him since his return from the Philippines.

of Young San Francisco Business Man, Ceremony
Being Performed at Home of the Bride's Mother

of Miss Jennie Connor of this
city and Ollle Merle of Alameda
was solemnized this evening at
the home of the bride's mother,
lArs. . Jennie Connor, 993 Chester street.
The wedding appointments were simple
and tasteful, an effective arrangement of
foliage and Christmas berries constituting
the decorations. The Rev. Thomas Mc-
Sweeney, pastor of St. Francis de Sales,
officiated at the marriage ceremony,
which was witnessed by relatives only.
The bride's gown was of pale gray silk
crepe de chine over pink silk, and she car

ant was Miss Lillle Sandelin, her "chum"
and confidante since childhood. Miss San
delin wore pale green crepe de chine over
silk of the same shade, and carried pink
roses.

uty District Attorney of Alameda Coun
ty, whose engagement to Miss Pauline
Merle, the groom's sister, was announced
some time ago.
The young couple will make an extend
ed tour of the southern part of thÂ© State,
after which they will reside in Alameda
in a beautiful cottage, which, with the
furnishings, is a wedding gift from the
parents of the groom.
The wedding to-night was the culmina
tion of a long attachment between the
young bride and groom, which began
when they were learning their A B C'sÂ»
from the same book.
The groom is engaged in business with
his father, A. J. Merle, who is at the head
of the Novelty Plating Works of San
Francisco.

SWEEP SEAWARD
IN OPEN BOAT
Two Men Drift About
for Days Without
Food or Water.
Government Launch Rescues
Berkeleyans From
Ocean Wave.
BERKELEY. Dec tLâ The treacherous
currents of thÂ© bay waters swept two
South Berkeleyans through the Golden
Gats In an unmanageable boat during tha
darkness early Thursday morning. They
drifted about on thÂ« ocean until rescued
late yesterday by a Government launch
sent from Goat Island. The men wero
without food or water and In constant
peril of their lives during the days and
night that they drifted about on the
swirling waters. But for the passing of
a lone fisherman, who warned the Gov
ernment officials of the men's danger,
their names would probably bÂ« added to
the list of those who sleep beneath tha
billows.
On Wednesday last D. J. Keane of 201$
Ashby avenue, and Arthur St. Sure, a
Southern Pacific overland conductor who
resides In this city, went to Tlburon.
where Keane purchased a sloop. There
was gome delay In getting the boat rigged
and it was 10 o'clock at night before tfiÂ«
men started for Oakland Creek. They
were well out In the bay before It was
discovered that the center board would
not work. The boat answered her helm
badly, but Keane decided to make ths at.
tempt to cross the bay. as he had sailed
it many times before.
The mouth of Oakland Creek waa
reached at about 1:30 Thursday mornlnjr,
but It was found Impossible to get in.
owing to the strong tide running out.
Keane and St. Sure decided to put back
and they were carried rapidly across the
bay by the wind and ebbing water. Dur
ing the night an anchorage was secured,
the men were not positive where, but
since then they have concluded that It
must have been near Mission Rock.
Drift Out WMle Sleeping-.
Keane and his companion -were tired
out by the night's sail and dropped to
sleep In the bottom of the boat. In the
night the anchor dragged and when tha
men awoke the boat was past Fort Point
and still going rapidly to sea. The sail
was hoisted In hopes of holding against
the tide, but the wind was light and tha
boat refused to answer her helm.
At Point Bonlta the men shouted them
selves hoarse and fired all their ammuni
tion in an effort to attract attention, but
to no avail. A fisherman passed close
to them but refused to heed their cries.
Boats came and went, hut their signals
of distress were unnoticed.
AH day and the next night the boat
drifted about. The men became frantlo
from want of food and more especially
water and through the terror of their
situation.
Late yesterday a lone fisherman In a
gasoline launch beard their faint outcrle*.
He was unable to aid them, owing to a
short supply of gasoline, but promised to
report them at Goat Island. Fortunately
the weather was clear and the Govern
ment launch had but little difficulty la
locating them. The sloop was towed to
the Oakland mole, where the men were
landed, exhausted from their trying ex
perience.
Discharge Their Shotguns.
The rescued men were given food and
drink before being started for their
homes. They were completely collapsed
and feel yet the severe effects of the
desperate fight for life. St. Sure said to
day:
We had glren IP kÂ°DÂ« entirely when that
flshlng-boat picked us up. It seemed as If days
passed before thÂ« launch overhauled ua. With
out food or water and shelterless from the cold
wind. It seemed as If we would perish, miser
ably within sight of land.
We had shotguns with us, but after discharg
ing every shell we had Ineffectually we gave
up hope of arousing any ono to our desperate
plight.
I wouldn't underro the experience again fa*
all of the boats on the bay. -
Keane has a family that had become
distracted because of his long and unex
plained absence. "When he appeared at
home there was great rejoicing there.

YEAR'S OUTPUT
WILL BE LARGE
Mines of State Promise
'Satisfactory Record
of Increase
Dredgers Add Much to the
Total of Yellow Metal
Produced. â 
The mining men are speculating con
cerning the output of the mines of Cali
fornia during the past year. State Min
eralogist Aubury says that it will be
s^r.ir.e months before the facts can be fully
learned. He is of the opinion that the
output of minerals will be much larger
than it was last year, although" lie does
not wish to hazard a guess as to the ex
tent of the increase. Probably it will
amount to not less than f2,<m.<X.W. This is
ihe general opinion of many who are
versed in the work of the year in this
State. 'J he dredgers have added to the
gold output very largely. The situation
at home, among the miners, is one for
satisfaction. More capital is looking â  this
way than for a long time previous. Sci
entific work is finding values in ground
that has been supposed to be worked out.
I'.Ilning operations In Amador County
are actively progressing. The Defender
mine has been unwatered to the 390-foot
level and sinking has been resumed. .At
the Mitchell mine there are ten stamps
running to the full capacity. The Tua
cano mine is being opened up by the
Amadcr-Phoenix Company, which will
begin to mill as soon as the mill is up and
a tramway from the shaft to the mill has
been completed. A new shaft Is down
140 feet. The Standard Electric Company
will be operating In about two months.
Connection has been made between the
Tabeaud reservoir and the river, and the
Page dam has been completed. All that
lerr.alns to be done before operations by
the electric company can begin is the
completion of the pipe lines from Page's
dam to the river. The company has 500J
inches of water and a head of about 1M0
ieet. Twenty men are grading on the
Finch ranch, near Forest Home, and put
ting up a mill which will be operated
witli petroleum fuel. The Cranmer broth
ers have started up their mill near Dry
town.
The Mining and Scientific Press reports
that a strike of ore running $48 to the
ton is rumored in connection with the
Gold Hill mine near Angels Camp.
Philadelphians Mining.
' A Philadelphia company Is developing
the Belle mine la Mono County, near
Benton. The Golden Gate mine near
Urid^eport has started up with a three
sianip mill, v.-ith considerable ore in
sight.
Extensive improvements are planned
for the Harvard mine near Jamestown,
in Tuolumne County. Woodruff & St.
C'lair, to whom the Mount Lily mine near
Columbia has been bonded, have started
up. The Cracker Jack mine near Colum
bia has made a shipment of bullion. A
five-stamp mill has been removed from
Kzglz Creek and set up at the Contention
mine. One hundred acres of land, consti
tuting 1 what is known as the Springfield
Tunnel Company's placer claim on Table
Mountain, west from Columbia, has been
bonded to A. L. Homer of Alameda for
twelve months, the option being for
$18,000.
L. F. Montcagle. C. Paige. A. R. Pews
and F. W. Mahler of San Francisco are
the directors of the Deadwood Mining
Company, which is about to put up a
hydraulic plant at Deadwood Creek, in
Sisklyou County, near Yreka. The John
Quincy mine at Oro Flno, Sisklyou Coun
ty, has resumed operations. This Is a
placer proposition. The McKeene mine
has also been started up. A shaft 200 feet
deep will be put down at thÂ© Red Bird
quartz mino near Yreka.
Dillon & Son are developing the 16 to 1
quartz mine at Washington, Nevada
County. Operations are going on at " the
Eclipse mine at Gold Flat, near Nevada
City.
Operations at the Blackjack mine In
El Dorado County, at Centerville, have
been suspended for the winter season.
Heavier machinery will be Installed In
the spring at the elate quarry at Placer-
Yille.
In Calaveras County.
The Calaveras Citizen says:
The California Ophlr mine Is In financial
trouble. During- the week attachments aggre
gating over $10,000 have been placed on the
property. The mine was dosed Sunday, all the
men except one shift being laid off. The parties
sttachingr are the Angels Iron Works. Manuel
Estate Company and J. K. Dorroh, and the
amount claimed Is for machinery, lumber and
supplies. The Bluejay mine at Jesua Maria,
owned by George "W. Brown of. Boston, will
probably be operated very shortly. The com
pany operating the Lancell mine near Buckeye
has secured an extension of time on the prop
erty and work has been resumed after a short
stop. Thirty men are e.t present employed by
the Fannie Marls Mining and Milling Company
of Glencoe. The Buenv Vista Copper Mining
Company is making progress. The boarding

in Favor of Great
DaaL
The Daily Calif ornian, published at
Bakersfield, which is the center of the oil
industry, concedes that the recent action
of the Chicago Crude. Aztec, Central Point
Consolidated and Toltec oil companies fur
nishes a good indication of the future suc
cess of the Associated Oil Company. .The
stockholders of these, four corporatiTTfa
unanimously voted to cast their lot with
the Associated Oil Company. Tha Califor
nian is in a good position to know what ia
going on among- the producing: oil com
panies of the Kern River district. As
other important companies are taking th.3
same course, through their stockholders,
as the four companies named in the fore
going the impression 13 not confined to
Bakersfield that a way haa been finally
found to insure united action among those
who are most directly concerned in the
ultimate outcome of the negotiation*
that have been goings on for some month*.
When the plans of tho Associated OU
Company were originally given exclusive
publication in The Call on the day follow
ing the filing cf the articles of incorpora
tion of that company, Henry Ach said In
an interview that there were about thirty
companies that were expected to Join tha
combine. The total number Joining to

Orders Many Tank Cars.
The National Oil Reporter say3:
One of the larcest single orders ever elven
out for oil tank cars to handle part o{ tha
crude oil output of Beaumont waa placed ia
St. Louis a month ago, the contract calling
for BOO cars having 1 a capacity oC 200 barrel*
each. Since the original order waa Kiven.
however, it has become necessary *0r It to bÂ»
duplicated, and the company giving the order
writes that the last 500 cars will have a
capacity of 300 barrels each. Arrangements
are being perfected with the railroad com
panies to run these cars in solid trains between
Beaumont and St. Louis. The first allotment
of cars will be delivered within the next tea
or fifteen days. *nd the whole order for lOfiO
cars will be completed by April 1. TbiÂ« uac*|p
taking is in line with what seems to be Tr.a
policy wilich is to be pursued in several cases
in the Beaumont field, viz., the construction
of their own cars for oil-operatins companies.
But the cars are by no means to be the only
means of oil transportation. It is announced
that one company, which is to establish a big
refining and reduction plant at Orange. Tei.,
will pipe its oil from Eeaumont and will havÂ»
tankage for 25,000,000 gallons of oil. Another
company proposes to builii a pipe line to a
point near Galveston, where the oil will ba
placed upon tank steamers. Another corpora
tion, the Beaumont Oil Transportation Com
pany, has already secured five vessels of 30.000
barrels capacity each to transport oil from
Galveston and Beaumont to points along the
North Atlantic coast.

able to fix any stated price for oil at this
time. The Herald says:
From statistics that were presented the fact
was gleaned that the output of the Lcs An
geles field approached 9O.C0O barrels a month,
and that the consumption is about 65.0CO bar
rels a month, making an average of about 1000
barrels a day in excess of production. This
surplus ls being stored in tanks by de
livery or stored in tanks In the various
parts of the field. Reports from other oil
fields also showed that production was not de-
Creasing and that many new wells in the
eastern end of the field were producing oil
that was up to the average formerly reported.

FERRAL DENIES
BEING VENOMOUS
Attorney Says- He Did
Not Intend to Show
Contempt.
v The hearing of the petition for & writ
of habeas corpus filed by Attorney Rob
ert Ferral, who hopes by means of the
writ to escape punishment for contempt
of court, was heard by Judge Graham
yesterday. Samuel M. Shortridge and ex-
Judge *D.T. Murphy addressed tne court
in support of the petition. .
Murphy said he was sure his client, like
himself, "had all the respect in the world
for Judges both on and oft tne bench, and
never would intentionally cast odium upon
them nor offend the dignity or the feel
ings of the bench In any way. I am
sure," said Murphy, "that Mr. Ferral
meant nothing by his remark to Judge
Dunne that could be construed Into con
tempt."
Shortridge spoke in the same half-apol
ogetic strain and then raised the point
that as contempt of court is a. crime that
Judge Dunne had no right to fine Ferral
without a trial or hearing.
Ferral was placed on the stand and ex
amined by Assistant District Attorney
Greaney. Greaney asked the â witness If
it was not so that "his remark to the
Judge was not occasioned by venomous
feeling."
"Venomous," exclaimed Ferral. "I am
sure that my remark was not prompted
by any such feeling."
The case was continued at this point
until to-morrow at 2 p. m.
CHICAGO WILL HAVE
V ABTJNDANT COAL SOON
Critical Period of the Fuel Shortage
â  ";' Is Now Reported to Be
Over. >
: CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â Chicago has passed
the most serious aspect of the coal short
age and after Monday manufacturing es
tablishments and big downtown buildings
will be in. a better position to fight the
possibility of anything approaching a
famine.
The coming of. Sunday and the appar
ent break in the cold spell are the two
things that coal men believe will bring
about this change In conditions. To-mor
row the great majority of the coal sup
plies of various plants will remain undis
turbed and within the next forty-eight
hours the railroad managers say that
they will be able to pour enough soft coal
Into the city to prevent any further
shortage.
. The actual shortage, and a scare result
ing from it, accompanied by a frantic
rush for coal by the owners of office
buildings and factories, have combined to
disrupt price? and derange the fuel scales
worse than at any time during the year.
All kinds of prices have been asked and
paid within the last two days.

WIFE SUES HER
PARENTS-IN-LAW
Mrs. O. Mugler Files Ac
tion for $30,000
Damages.
Clara Muglcr valued her whole heart at
JSO.OOO, and because it has been broken
she Is suing Peter Mugler and Mary Mug
ler. her father-in-law and mother-in-law,
respectively, for that amount. She claims
that the parents of her husband, Nicholas
Mugler, have alienated his affections and
caused her such mental anguish that her
physical strength has given way.
In the complaint filed by Mrs. Mugler
>e6terday ehe avers that ehe is very Â«ensl
tive. Because Bhe possesses nerves is due
her present predicament, so Bhe claims.
She married Nicholas at Berkeley In
January of this year. Her lot was one of
peace and happiness until the parents of
her hubby discovered that they did not
like her. "Then," says the broken-hearted
â wife, "they commenced a systematic at
tack upon his feelings and his love for
me, and destroyed the love and affection
he bore me."
The "systematic attack" complained of
has been going on, according to the com
plaint, since the first month after the
marriage. Like a good wife. Mrs. Mugler
has borne the loss of her husband's ca
1 esses without a murmur until a few days
ago. Then she thought it was time she
asserted herself. She appealed to her per
secutors, but they gave her only icy re
ception and cutting glances. Her appeals
but added to her misery, eo she thought
of the courts.
How she figured damages Is not* known,
but Burke & Burke, her lawyers, evident
ly thought they knew the value of a wom
an's heart and placed the amount at $30,
000.

SELVAGE READY
FOR CONGRESS
Willing to Enter Race
in the First Dis
. trict.
Rudolph Herold's term of office as State
Harbor Commissioner will expire March
13 next. .Applicants to succeed him are
already numerous. It Is known that
Frank French, who recently found that
the Thirty-sixth Assembly District was
too large for his vest pocket, would like
to receive a commission from the Gover
nor to serve the State on the Harbor
Board. While French has one eye on the
water front he is keeping the other one
on the County Clerk's office. He regards
the chief clerkship under County Clerk
elect Mahony as already won, but he is
looking for something better. Should
French be commissioned to succeed Her
old, State Senator Richard J. "Welch will
make a try for the first place under
Mahony.
It is gossip among the politicians that
the new Mayor has decided to appoint
Tax Collector J. H. Scott to the Civil
Service Commission.
The contest for the honor of represent
ing in Congress the First California Dis
trict promises to become interesting. The
politicians hardly know how to size up
tha readjusted First District, as the ap
portionment which goes into effect Jan
uary 1 confuses the calculations. The
district embraces the following counties:
Del Norte, Humboldt, SIskiyou, Trinity,
Tehama, Shasta, Modoc, Lassen, Plumas,
Sierra, Nevada Placer, El Dorado, Ama
dor, Calaveras, Alpine, Mono, Mariposa
and Tuolumne.
It Is quite a long distance from Hum
boldt County and Alpine and Mono to
Mariposa, but Senator Selvage believes
he can make a good race for Congress
over the territory. He finds good training
quarters in San Francisco, where oppor
tunity is presented to meet in a neutral
zone Harold T. Power and Jacob H. Neff
of Placer, E. C. Voorhels of Amador, E.
B. Edson of Siskiyou and other leading
men of the First District. The old re
liable Republican counties of Napa and
Marin have been taken from the First
?nd placed in the Second District.

ties of the position during tho absence

chosen.
General Randal, commander of the De

LAWYERS TALK
AND THEN DINE
Â»
California State Bar As
sociation Finishes
Its Work.
D. M. Delmas Delivers a Fine
Address on an Economic
Subject.
The California State Bar Association is
now fairly launched. The days, of its
travail are over and the work of organi
zation will now give way to earnest labor
on legal problems that confront the law
yers and the jurisfa in their every-day
work.
During the morning session of the asso
ciation convention yesterday the assem
bled attorneys listened to reports 1 1 on.
special committees In the maple room ol
the Palace. In the afternoon in the Su
preme Court chambers addresses were de
livered by Frank N. Short of Fresno ana
D. M. Delmas. Then came the banquet
in the evening at tho California Hotel
and the final adjournment until next
year's convention. t
Delmas' address was the feature of the
day's proceedings. To a crowded court
room he reviewed the struggles between
labor and capital, analyzed the natural
antipathies brought out in the conflict
and ended in a fine rhetorical passage,
suggesting justice as the remedy to crown
the reconciliation of the two.
"Justice as a Factor in Economical
Problems" was his subject. Running
through his discouroe was the theme of
justice. So effective was the address
upon the audience that the association
resolved to have printed 100.000 copies,
which will be distributed throughout the
State.
Committee Suggestions.
At the beginning of the morning ses
sion Van R. Paterson of the Judiciary
committee reported on a plan to relieve
the congestion of business In the Supreme
Court. He said he had been in consulta
tion with Chief Justice Beatty and he
thought his suggestion was the best. This
was for the establishment of three appel
late courts in different cities of the State
â one In Los Angeles, one in San Jose and
one in this city. A committee of seven
will be appointed to devise such means
as may be practicable and feasible for
the relief of the Supreme Court.
The Superior Judges and District Attor
neys throughout the State were appoint
ed a committee on extension.
The committee on legal education ad
vised a plan of qualification and admis
sion to the bar. It was suggested that a
commission of three be appointed by the
Supreme Court to give both written and
oral examinations to applicants.
Frank N. Short's address was an urgent
call for help on the part of every lawyer
In the State to better legal conditions.
Itelmas' Stirring Address.
Mr. Short was succeeded by D. M. Del
mas. It was the peroration of Delmas'
speech that roused the audience. It is
as follows:
Side by side with the work of education shall
that of religion proceed. Unmistakable indi
cations seem to leave no room to doubt that if
the church â Protestant or Catfcollc â would re
tain its position as a controlling factor in
shaping the actions of men, it must place Itself
in thd forefront of that longing for economic
jurtico which 13 now so powerfully agitating
the maeÂ«s. They mistake the temper of tho
times they fail to rate at its proper valiio
the intellectual development brought about by
universal education, who fancy that the minds
of the multitude can long continue to be en
tertained, or the yearning of their hearts be
satisfied, with theological disquisitions about
controverted dogmas, or the pageants of cere
nicnial worship.
Tho people will no longer believe that the
paramount function of religion is to prepare
mou for the life to come. They will insist that
Its office is to help them to right living In tho
life this side the grave. The downtrodden and
the oppressed will refuse assent to the doc
trine that to bear wrongs without a murmur
is meritorious in the sight of God, or that the
sufferings of this life constitute the surest title
to everlasting Joy in heaven. The twentieth
century will cast aside these doctrines as the
false teachings of a past age â an age when
the church derived Its support from the favors
of a triumphant militancy, taught the divine
right of kings to reign, and. on condition of
becoming a partaker in their rule, helped
princes to keep their peoples In subjection by
inculcating the doctrine of submission to au
thority â an age when, to borrow the language
of England's illustrious historian, "the moat
slavish theory that has ever been known among
men prevailed," and when "no breach of law
or contract, no excess of cruelty, rapacity or
licentiousness on the part of a rightful king
could justify his people in withstanding him
by force."
Once more, as in the days of the Apostles
and the martyrs, the true nature of Christ's
mission upon earth shall stand revealed. Ones
more his teachings, disentangled from the en
cumbering casuistry of schoolmen and the
subtleties of theologians, shall be understood In
their true and sublime simplicity. Once more
his gospel shall b<? known to be the gospel of
humanity, his kingdom the brotherhood of
man, and his rule the sway of eternal Justice.
And bo. through the enlightenment of the
Intellect and the purification of the heart, final!
justice be established among the peoples of
the earth. And eo peace shall be proclaimed
between the contending hosts of capital and la
bor on' that day when, not only up3n the
frieze of the courthouse in the valley of Santa
Clara, but over the entrance of every sencol,
collpge and university, and above the portal of
every chapel, church and cathedral, shall be
Inscribed the sanctifying words Justltlae Ded
icata, and when, even thus, by a common and
unlvÂ«rpal impulse of mind and of heart, of rea
son and of sentiment, the abodes of law. edu
cation and religion shall all be equally devoted,
dedicated, consecrated to Justice.
TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE
Hi DAWS0N IS OUSTED
Governor Say res Revokes the Coom
mission Issued to Dr. Willis
E. Everett.
TACOMA, Dec. 21.â Late in Novem
ber the acting American Consul in
Dawson received a proclamation from
Governor Joseph D. Sayres of Texas re
voking a commission previously issued to
Dr. Willis E. Everett to act as Commis
sioner of Deeds for Texas in the Yukon
territory. Governor Sayres' letter and
proclamation stated that evidence on file
in his office disclosed that Everett was
not a proper person to hold such office or
to perform the duties Imposed on him by
reason of his appointment.
In defending himself Dr. Everett says
that Governor Sayres' letter of Instruc
tions was ambiguous, and that under date
of September 10. he wrote to the Governor
that he would cease to act further until
the vague sections of his instructions
were construed by the Texas executive.
Everett was formerly Commissioner of
Deeds in Dawson for Alaska and Califor
nia. He went to Dawson from. Tacoma
in 189S, having formerly conducted here
the largest assaying business in the
Northwest. . .
Chinese Plot to Evade Exclusion.
PORT TOWNSEND, Dec. 21.-Informa
tion received here by members of the
local Chinese colony is to the effect that
a large number of stock companies are
being organized in the southern provinces
of China, with capitals of $1,000,000 and
upward, and stock to the amount of $500
will be issued to Chinese coming to
America, so that they can show upon be
ing examined by the customs officials at
the pert of entry that they belong to the
exempt class, or merchants. This action
is said to be the result of the agitation
for a more stringent exclusion law at the
expiration of the present law next May.
Killed by a Trolley Car.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 21.â Charles M.
Myers, superintendent of Ihe City Park]
was run over and killed by a trolley ear
in Upper Albina to-day. He was driving
across the streetcar track in a buggy
when his horses started to run away,
throwing Myers on the track In front of
a car. The fall stunned him. and the
rapidly moving car ran over his body.
SQUALL UPSETS
AMATEUR SAILOR
Harvey Darneal Jr. Nar
rowly Escapes Being
Drowned.
Chief Officer of the Tiburon
Saves Canoeist Prom an
Untimely Death.
Harvey "Darneal Jr., a member of
the Alameda Canoe Club, had a nar
row escape from, death yesterday. He
was out for a sail with his baby
fore and main sails set and was rushing
along at a great gait when the Tiburon
hove in sight. Captain White saw a squall
coming and sounded a warning whistle,
but the canoeist only wavcM a handker
cl.ief and laughed. Suddenly the squall
struck the Email craft and as both sails
were fast over she went in an instant.
The Tiburon was at once put about and
after half an hour's hard work both canoe
and canoeist got aboard. The latter was
treated to a hot drink and sent to the
engine room to dry out.
Had it not been for Chief Officer A.
Paulson of the Tiburon the man in the
water would probably have lost his life.
He let go his hold on the canoe and was
going down when Paulson jumped over
board and held him up until assistance
came.
Darneal is a son of Hervey Darneal,
official stenographer in the Alameda
County Superior Court, residing 1 at 903
Grand street, Alameda. Young- : Darneal
said last night:
"I had bought the canoe at Tiburon
to-day and started to sail the boat back
to Alameda. There was a sliding j seat
attachment with which I was not
familiar. In making a tack the canoe
capsized. I had it almost righted when
the steamer's boat picked me up."
Darneal is an expert canoeist. He is a
member of the Alameda Boating Club
and the Enclnal Yacht Club and ranks
as one of the best amateur boatmen on
the bay.
The Darneals are among the leading
families of Alameda. . i
SFTJRIOTJS MASONS' LODGES
IN THE. EASTERN STATES
Seceders From the Craft Do Not
, Disturb Fraternity of This
Community.
The fact that certain individuals who
were once Masons of lodges in Ohio with
drew from the craft because dissatisfied
with certain rulings and organized what
they term lodges of Masons in that State
and in New York State does not disturb
the Masonic fraternity of this community.
There is but one Masonic fraternity, and
under the law of that order -there can be
but one. It does not matter how many
so-called Masonic lodges may be organ
ized without the consent of the head of
the order, they are not lodges of Free and
Accepted Masons.
One of the charges delivered to the
worshipful master of every Masonic
lodge is that he promises that he will not
recognize any lodge or body of men who
are not working under a charter granted
by the proper authorities. Any lodge
that is "organized without the charter of
the true fraternity is recognized as a
spurious institution and none of its mem
bers can affiliate with or enter any Ma
sonic lodgeroonj. Therefore those individ
uals who have joined the new organiza
tions of eelf-styled Masons are only such
in name, but not in fact. So far as Ma
sonry is concerned, while they may be
working along the lines of Masonry, they
will never be recognized by any Masonic
body. , '
Grand Master Wells of the jurisdiction
of California is of the opinion that the
movement will not amount to anything
for the reason that those who are inter
ested in it have not a charter nor can
they obtain one.
It was the opinion of a number of prom
inent Masons in this city yesterday that
when those who have been induced to
join the spurious lodges realize that they
are not Masons and will not be recog
nized as such they will drop out and
cease to be members of an organization
that has no standing in the fraternal
world.
SEVERAL RINGS FOUND
Or THEIR POSSESSION
Harry Howard and Edward Larkiu
Arrested on Suspicion That
They Are Thieves.
Harry Howard and Edward Larkln were

ARRIVES IN BALLAST FROM HAVRE
Sails Half Way Round World With Only Sand in Her Hold in Order
to Secure a Cargo of Wheat for England and Furnishes Example of
Vv'hat Subsidy Law Has Done for Vessels Flying Tricolor of France
AMONG the vessels arriving here
yesterday were the French bark
Genevlve Molinos and the
schooner Allen of the sugar
fleet. The former comes all the
tray from France in ballast in order to
secure a grain charter. Owine to the
lli^ral subsidy KlXowed its merchant ma
rine l-y the French Government the ves-
Edc flying the tricolor can come from the
ends ot" the earth to California in ballast
and compete with all nationalities In the
â¢Â«^Â»Ttter of charters.
The Genevlve Molinos had a most
eventful voyage. She left Havre for San
Francisco 123 days ago and made a splen
did run to the equator. On October 5 In
the afternoon a sudden gale came up that
threw the sliin aback and for hours she
would not answer her helm. Finally the
rr.ain lower and upper topsails were car
ried away and the bark paid off. After
the erale had blown itself out fresh sails
â were bent and the vessel once more placed
on her course. Another gale was run into
ne3r the Hern, but strange to say off the
Cepe of Storms the Molinos encountered
Ti< ihir.g but light winds and calms.
Once around the Horn, however, all
kinds of weather was experienced and
in latitude SO degrees south and longi
tude '2 dc-prees west a heavy thunder
storm made the crew think the end of
the earth had come. The run up the
coast was a favorable one and had It not
bten for the fog Captain Lemaitre thinks
he would have made port a week ago. As
it la the Genevlve Molinos has made a
record run from Havre and her captain
says she can do better.
The Molinos is a new vessel and comes
on her maiden voyage to this port. She
â was built two years ago at Nantes for
the Sccietie des Vorllers, France, and is

SPLENDID THE OUTLOOK FOR SHIPPING
AND ALL OF ITS KINDRED INTERESTS
San Francisco's Commerce Is Beginning to Improve Under the Stimulus
. of Better Railway Facilities, Fine Pacific Ocean Liners and the
Probable Early Construction of the Great Waterway Through Nicaragua
THE fact being that the greater
bulk of manufactures to be ex
ported from San Francisco by sea
must for some years to come be
manufactured in the East, where
the centralization of population furnishes
a great home market, it follows that the
introduction of competition in the over
land carrying, trade, following the coming
of the Santa Fe Railroad, is of the first
importance to the shipping of this port.
true is it that ships bound in
through the Golden Gate with wares des
tined to be moved across the territory of
the United States must be much more nu
merous when there are double the facili
ties for transportation. The Valley Rail
road, which was built by Claus Spreckels
and his business associates largely to re
lieve the local situation by lowering the
rates for carriage within the boundaries
of California, is now, in its use by the
Santa Fe, of significance to the traffic of
the entire globe.
This is one of the new things that has
improved the outlook for commercial San
Francisco since the period when the com
mercial men of this city were compelled
to fight the overland lines for the privi
lege of using its natural advantages of
position upon the Pacific. Other consid
erations Join to justify the confidence
with which this port views the future.,
Promising Outlook.
The outlook is vastly better than it was
ten years ago for shipping here and for
all the industries that employ ships as
carriers. The splendid steamers of the
Oceanic Steamship Company, by the speed
and certainty of their voyages, have put
San Francisco upon the route officially
adopted by the British Government for
the transmission of its malls between
London and Australia. The near con
struction of the first Pacific ocean cable
is promised and the, contracts are let for
a part of .Xhe work 'upon that great en
terprise. . Wireless te'iegraphy has been
adopted by the Government of the United
States to connect this port and the Far
allon Islands. New lints of great steam
ers have been established that bring San
Francisco into immediate touch with ports
that have been, in point of time and ac
cess, hitherto remote.
The construction of the Nicaragua canal
is well assured. This will bring the fields
and orchards of California 10,000 miles
nearer to Liverpool than they are now
and will undoubtedly result Jn establish
ing direct lines of steamers Ubtween San
Francisco and all the leading ports of
Europe. â¢ â 
â  A vast number of vessels will be re
quired In the not distant future to move
|he commerce of the Pacific Ocean that
moves in and out of this port, by reason
of the enlarged opportunities for Ameri
can enterprise in China, Japan, the Phil
ippines, the Far East and especially also
in Russia, when the road to Vladivostok
Is finally opened and in operation in con
nection with trans-Pacific steamship lines
using the Golden Gate at one end of their
long run.
The great carrying- capacity of modern
steamships, while they have the tendency
to keep down for the future any move
ment upon the part of the rail carriers
to inflict excessive charges on merchan
dise for the long overland haul, also af
ford in themselves means for the vast
increase of freights, that must be carried
economically.
The student of railway policies must
also see in the extension of what .is
known as the "postage stamp rate" or
uniform rate for moving freights to the
Pacific Coast from all the great territory
from the Atlantic Ocean, to Denver, a
oromise that the roads expect to win
oroJits on'carrying all the peculiar prod
ucts of all that vast region to this point
for export. The business of South America
And of Central American States to be car
-^d. in ships will be largely increased.
California Providing Freights.
The home field affords hope for the ship
ping men. No one can adequately esti
mate the productivity of California of
foods from the soil peculiar in varieties
exclusive to California in that no other
section of the United States has been able
â¦o grow many of them, enormous in ag
gregate bulk, fleets will be ultimately
needed to transport them. There are very
significant statements in the last annual
report of President N. P. Chipman of , the
California State Board of Trade, showing
something concerning the output in fruits
of the Iand3 north of Tehachapi, the ter
ritory immediately tributary to San Fran
cisco. General Chipman finds the follow-'
â¢ng to be facts:
Of the green deciduous fruits shipped out of
the State, 8799 carloads went from. Northern
California and but nineteen carloads from
â¢Southern California; on the other hand, the
shipments of citrus fruits show that in 1900,
the year to which I refer, 21.813 carloads went
from Southern California nnd R27 from North
ern California. A like disparity will be seen to
Â»xist in favor 01 Northern California in the
â¢natter of dried fruit, raisins and canned goods,
as appeared in the shipments of green decid
uous Iruits. This must necessarily be so be
cause of the much larger development of this
branch of the fruit industry in the north than
in the south. There went from the north of
dried fruit S49O carloads, and from Southern
California 369; of raisins there went from the
north 3421 carloads, and from the south 161; of
canned goods from the north 4568 carloads, 492
from the south. To the shipments from the
north should be added those appearing in the
tables by sea from San Francisco, amounting
to 32S4 carloads. The magnitude of the citrus
industry in the south will be appreciated
when it is observed that it amounts to nearly
as many carloads as the north sends out of
green deciduous fruits, dried fruit and raisins,
combined.
In the matter of the shipments of green
vegetables, the tables show that considerable
more went from the north than from the
â¢outh; that is, 2757 carloads from the north,
by rail and by sea, and 2053 from the south.
Of the canned vegetables reported, 307 car
loads went from the north and 4 carloads
from tbe south.
Coming to the wine and brandy industry
it will be observed that of the wine 5169 car
loads went from the north and 83 carloads
from the south; and of the brandy, 325 car
loads from the north and 2 carloads from the
south. In addition to the foregoing- should be
added 2831 carloads by sea from San Francisco
of wine and 32. carloads of brandy. Wines and
brandies not segregated, from the north 430
carloads and from the south 191 carloads; total
shipments of wine and brandy from the north,
Â£789.4 carloads; from the south, 277.S; in all,
9067.3 carloads. It will be seen that, except
as to citrus fruits, the orchards and vineyards
of California are in the north, and that nearly
all the oranges and lemons are in the south.
An Enormous Gain.
Turning to the table of gains and, losses be
tween 1839 and 1900, it will be observed that
the shipments of green deciduous fruit fell off.
576 carloads in 1900. Citrus fruits showed a
gain of 9462 carloads; dried fruits showed a
gain of 312 carloads: raisins, a slight gain of
three carloads; nuts fell off eight carloads;
canned fruits gained thlrty-cne carloads; vege
tables gained 1736. carloads; wines and brandy,
M3 carloads, showing a net gain for the year
over 1S99 of 11.315 carloads, of which nearly
9000 carloads v.-ero citrus fruits."
Looking to the table of comparative ship
ments for a series of years since 1890, it will
be noticed that there has been a steady and
rapid growth of the citrus fruit industry. -Tha
shipments of green deciduous fruits have not
increased as has been our hope they would,
or as they ought to have Increased. The-ship
ments of 1894. were nearly as great as In 1900.
The result has been an increase in the dried
fruit product, the tables showing a very Bteady
growth, now amounting to over 9003 carloads,
as against 3229 carloads in 1530.
An examination shows also that the ra!sin
industry reached its maximum in 1S94, yielding
4695 carloads; but one year since that time,
1898, has the output been so great, and the
year 1900 was 36C4 carloads, about the same a*
in 1S99. It will be observed that the shipments
of wine and brandy since 1891 have increased
from 4765 carloads to 8067 carloads, nearly- Id)
per cent. The table o* clearances from San
Francisco by â  sea of cereals shows that the
shipment of flour was the greatest" In l$!>9
during a period of fourteen years. The exports*
of wheat in 1900 were nearly three times ah
great as in 1899; of oats, very much greater
than any previous year, and a greater ship
ment of barley than any previous year. We
commenced . gathering statistics of the output
of lumber in the State for thÂ« year 1SS8. which
showed in millions of feet 604 for that year,
and for the year 1900, 650. V ..
Significant Agencies.
Much more of a statistical sort, illus
trative of the possibilities of California
as a freight producer, could be supplied
if there were the proper space for It. The
foregoing is sufficiently indicative. In-
creased population will Insure many fold
increase of output.
"What the products of the manufactories
of California will be for ships to carry
Is a large problem. The two significant
developments that are now concerning
manufacturing in this State are the dis
covery of unlimited quantities of fuel oil
In the San Joaquin Valley and at other
points in the State, and the application
of the water power of the mountain
streams In the Sierras to the production
of electrical energy for the turning of
wheels.
The estimate is carefully made that In
three and one-half barrels of California
crude petroleum the steam producing ca
pacity is equal to one ton of coal. Al
lowing that oil shall reach ultimately $1
per barrel, although it is now sold at one
iourth of that price at the wells in Kern
County, it will be seen by shippers that
the problem of cheap fuel, which has
been one of the great drawbacks to this
State, has been practically abolished.
"With the tendency that San Francisco
has latterly shown to reach for markets
on her own account, and anticipating the
demand that may be created, it is not
going far from soberness of calculation,
when the great capacity of the freight
carrying vessels is considered together
with the cheapness of their operation,
to anticipate that raw materials which
are now lacking in this locality may yet
be laid down as cheaplv here as they are
elsewhere, and, now that the fuel prob
lem is solved, that they can be made up
on terms to compete with other* sections
of the country and originate home
freights for ships to carry that will be
of a character that is new for this port.
Mineral discoveries are in their Infancy.
Copper is throughout a large part of Cal
ifornia. Dredging for gold and the im
proved processes of quartz mining insure
a vast growth in the output of precious
mineral. The Alaskan mineral field is In
its infancy. Turn to whatever direction
one may, there is a rosy horizon for the
shipping 'of this port.
The Oriental Prospects.
The Chamber of Commerce of San Fran
cisco, taking a lively interest in the ex
tension of the shipping and commercial
interests of this port, commissioned "Wil
liam M. Bunker, who was about to travel
through Russia, to represent the Chamber
of Commerce abroad and to gather all
the information he could that would be of
value to the commercial community of
Sun Francisco. His report has been pub
lished In part In connection with the news
paper accounts of the doings of the cham
ber.
Dealing largely with Russia and China,
with which countries this port will have
a vast trade, some extracts from Com
missioner Bunker's report will be found
to be of general interest in thi3 particular
connection:
"American exports to Asia," says Com
missioner Bunker, "grew from $27,421,893
in 1S93 to $78,235,176 in 189? Hence our
consuming Interest in Asiatic affairs. Eu
rope looks askance aa the United States
decreases the Asiatic demand 'for Euro
pean goods. The fiercest struggle is in
Northern China and the Russian Asiatic
region. The foreign trade of China ap
proximated $330,000,000 in 1899. an advance
of $44,000,000 on the total of 1898 and double
that of 1S90. Sixty-three per cent of the
trade of China is with the British; Japan
has 11 per cent, the United States 10 per
cent and Russia 5 per cent. The balance
Is with France, Germany and other coun
tries. The United States and Germany
are gaining Chinese trade at the expense
of Great Britain. The latter has lost its
coarse sheeting business with China
through American enterprise. Great Brit
ain partly consoles Itself with the thought
that 61 per cent of the tonnage entering
Chinese ports in 1899 flew the British flag."
Commissioner Bunker traveled over, the
Siberian-Russian line of railway. He was
satisfied that the operation for some years
of a line from Irkutsk westerly had not
benefited European countries outside of
Russia.
"It has increased the population of Sibe
ria," he says, "but has not, and. in my opin
ion, after a close and careful study of the
entile line from "Vladivostok to St. Peters
burg, will not, give the European countries
outside of Russia a much wider Siberian mar
ket. The transit of goods from European
Russia to Russian Oriental ports over the
Trans-Siberian Railroad will cover not less
than three months, while the sea trip from
Odessa to Vladivostok Is forty-six to forty
seven days, and the cheaper freightage is by
the ocean route.
The Russlon volunteer fleet of steamers on
the Odessa-Vladivostok and Port Arthur line
has been augmented by the addition of 8000
ton vessels belonging to the Eastern Asiatic
Steamship Company of Copenhagen. The rail
road will strengthen Russia in the Orient,
will hasten the colonization of Siberia, will
furnish the Pacific States of America with
an enduring: market for food, products and
machinery, and will influence travel between
Euroupe, China and Japan."
Commissioner's Opinion.
After quoting statistics to some extent
to prove his position to be the correct one
concerning the question which so largely
concerns the commercial interests of San
Francisco, Commissioner Bunker presents
general conclusions, which are given in
part as below:
It is the fixed policy of the Russian Gov
ernment to develop as fast as may be possible
the present and prospective territory termed
Eastern Siberia. The necessity for this devel
opment is even greater than when the railroad
was planned. To colonize and civilize the vast
region which has Port Arthur for its southern
most seaport, Russia is making superhuman
efforts and many sacrifices. These figures tell
part of the story: The total trade of Euro
pean Russia for 1899 was S635.44O.00O. being a
decrease of J4O.C95.000, or 6.3 per cent, from
that of 1S98. The trade of Asiatic Russia
came to J7S.89O.C0O. an increase of $6,100,000
over that of 1S98. bringing the total decrease
of the foreign trade of the empire for 1899
down to $33,905,000. This was the first year
for a considerable period to show a balance
of trade against Russia. Our interest is, in
the increase of the Russian-Asiatic tra<> in
the face of a marked decline in the total for
eign trade of the empire.
Now that the Russians have through the
Chinese Eastern Railway secured the commer
clal control of Manchuria, we have to accept
that Chinese province as a prime factor in
the Russian-Asiatic trade problem. Because
more temperate in climate than the region
north of the Amur River, and richer in coal
and iron and presumably richer in gold and
several other natural resources, Manchu
ria will finally prove a trade bonanza. The
trade advantages are and should stay with us.
Our commercial revival and future are top
ics of talk In all the chier cities abroad. For
eigners engaged In Oriental trade are scecu
lating on our ability to take at its flood our
tide of prosperity. They have seen us turn
out the record warship of the world, from one

Movement of Tonnage.
San Francisco Is now recording & great
er tonnage movement In and out
of the Golden Gate In tha In
terest of commerce, foreign and
domestic, than ever before. For eleven
months the movement la larger than for
the entire year of 1900, notwithstanding:
that the strikes interfered to some ex
tent for a period of many weeks this year
with the free development of commerce.
There being still an unexplred period of
the present year, complete comparison
cannot well be made -with exact accuracy. Â»
other than for the year 1301 as against
other years. But, to Illustrate the growth
of local shipping Interests, the records oC
a few years preceding will do very well.
The shipments by sea from San Fran
cisco in 1900 were $15,151,178. as against
$10,660,231 in 1899 and $3,634,695 in 1S98. The
overland exports from San Francisco in
the same three years give an Idea of thÂ©
same expansion of home resources, as la

Shipowners Concerned.
The following is an extract taken from
the last annual report of the Board of
State Harbor Commissioners: "To in
sure the permanency of our commercial
prosperity the accommodations of the
port must be of the best and as good as
are afforded in any part of the world
Promptness and dispatch In the docking
of vessels and the handling of cargoes,
both inward and outward, is a matter of
much concern to ship-owners and the
consignees of merchandise. Delays caused
by lack of port facilities are alike expen
sive to ship-owners and consignees of
cargo, and now with so many competitive
ports seeking trade, one against the
other, energy and progressivenesa ty
harbor boards- must be exercised."
Charts for the Navy.
The supply of cruising charts to the
navy of the United States is now made
up from three sources, so reports lieu
tenant Commander C. G. Calkins. Thes^e
sources are as follows: Hydrosraphir
Office charts, which are publications of
original surveys or modified reproduc
tions of sheets printed abroad: Coast Sur
vey charts, covering the coasts and in
land waters of the United States, reserved
by law for the organization known as thw
Coast and Geodetic Survey and attached
to the Treasury Department: British Ad
miralty charts, published by the Hydro
graphic Department at London. Every
man-of-war is provided with a complete
set of charts of these classes for the sta
tion to which she may be assigned, an<l
corrected flies, covering all stations, are
kept for reference at each Branch Hydro
graphic Office and thus made accessible
to the nautical community.

ARTISTS WANTED.
Outside of newspaper work my shop pays
artists the best, and the chances of ad-
vancement to people of ability are exception-
ally good. I do commercial art work only
â the illustrating of catalogues, booklets,
magazine advertisements, etc.
My shop Is the only one of its kind upon
the coast and therefore In advertising for
artists I find It necessary to explain the na-
ture of the work because a large number of
people otherwise apply who have no concep-
tion of Its requirements. I pay straight sal-
aries â allowing no piece work, and have now
positions open to artists who can put in de-
tails faithfully.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21. â Amalgamated Copper
ehowed the same stable tendency between C6%
and 07 which it developed yesterday and the
relief afforded the general market by this turn
of affairs continued In evidence. The bank
statement gave evidence of satisfactory con
ditions in the money market and also prompted
some buying of Btock. The sympathetic
etrength in the general market was taken ad
vantage of for an active liquidation in Sugar,
which forced that stock 3% under last night
and unsettled the market and made the closing
tary Net resu'jts are not generally important
and changes run both ways. The recent cut
in the price of tugar leaves a narrow margin
for pront on Its Droduction and fears are en-,
lertained of a renewal cf the sugar and cof
fee war. The Etrength of the day wae most
marked in the local tractions and in the coal
ers both soft and anthracite. Hocking Valley
added 2% to yesterday's 3-point rise and the
preferred gained IMj- There was a report of
the pending acquisition of another railroad and
a' -umor of the proposed retirement of the
preferred flock. The enormous speculation in
Amalgamated Copper was an unsettling influ
ence on the general market duri.iK ttÂ» whole
week Dealings in that one stock constituted
frora'ltt to 1% of the aggregate dealings on
<-aeh day of the week and its incessant and
violent fluctuations baffied the insight of the
most ekillful operatore. The successive cuts
in the price of raw copper, while doubtless of
vital import to the ultimate value of the stock,
vetmed to have a soothins effect upon the
Vock while adding to the unsettlemtut in the
general ir.arket. Late in the week the dividend
action on the utock overshadowed a-l other
considerations. The 1 per cent declaration had
been pretty accurately expected in spite of the
flood of rumors constantly set afloat by the
professional traders for manipulative purposes.
Olie official statement by the directors after
the dividend declaration threw very little light
on the situation beyond that Indicated by the
previous course of events, but it had the ad
vantage of formulated authorized information
as against wild surmise and rumor which had
prevailed for a long time previously. The state
ment ig accepted a s a proclamation that the
Independent producers having declined to main
tain prices the Amalg-a mated Company is pre
pared to make such prices as are necessary to
secure a market for the product of Ha com
panies. Such action is regarded as promising
lavorable results in general business and more
healthy and natural conditions in the copper
trade Itself. By stimulating- consumption at
the lower prices and decreasing production by
keeping out the profit for more expensive pro
ducers matters are set in trim for an adjust
ment of equilibrium between demand and sup
ply by the operation of natural law. As tor
the effect upon the value of Amalgamated Cop
per stock itself the fluctuations in that stock
indicate continued uncertainty. The price ad
justment In the Copper market has had a par
allel in that for other staple commodities.
There have been cuts In the price of lead,
linseed oil, sugar, petroleum and in the specu
lative markets for grains and cotton. The iron
market affords a strong contrast, where strenu
ous efforts are reported making to keep down
| prices end prevent a runaway market. "With
production in the trade at record figures the
consumptive demand ig still so urgent as to
offer abundant opportunity for asking advanced
prices. The dominant interest in the trade
urres the benefit of stability of orlces and
points to the sudden collapse in demand which
resulted from the buoyant rise of orices in
1S8&. In the railroad world the anomaly Is
presented of a pressure of traffic which the
equipment is inadequate to accommodate, ac
cording to continued complaints which come
from all sections, while reports, of cutting of
rates are more and more frequent. The logic
of cutting- prices to compete for business while
more business Is offering than can be carried
is not clear to the speculative mind In Its
efforts to fathom the future effect on railroad
earnings. Even railroads which are Included
in the newly formed community of Interests
are affected by rate cutting-, â  according to re
ports published In Wall street. The directors
of the new Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Railroad, as announced, reveal the expected
representation of Union Pacific interests and
the delayed annual report of the Union Pacific
Is awaited with interest to disclose the process
or financing that company's interest in tha
Burlington and the Northern Securities Com
pany. Early in the week there was rather
urgent pressure in the stock market against
Union Pacific and St. Paul and the stock of
the Northern Securities Company was de
pressed to near par In the curb market on al
most nominal dealings. Railroad earnings con
tinue to show Increases over those of a year
apo. The growing: hope that the money mar
ket would work safely through to the period of
relaxation after the annual settlements has en
couraged the firm holdings of stocks. The pas
sage of the time for gold shipments to be
available for use in the annual settlements
abroad without further outgo this -week has
helped this feeling- of confidence. Prices as a
whole are higher for the. week.
There has been a broad and active bond mar
ket this week. Bhowlng the effect of the In
vestment demand In anticipation of the Janu
ary disbursements.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â The statement of the
Associated Banks for the week ending to-day
' chows: Loans, $857,005,400; decrease, $13,
; 3CS.500. Deposits, $204,090,300; decrease. $19,
i 062,000. Circulation. $31,929,300; increase, $50.
â  300. Legal tenders, $70,7C0,CC0; decrease,
j $1,025,200. Specie. $101,048,800; decrease,
1 $3,410,000. Reserves, $231,809,400; decrease,
j $4,435,200. Reserve required, $226,024,075;
I decrease, $4,765,500. Surplus, $5,785,325; ln
; crease. $330,300.
; Ths Financier says: The traceable move
j ments of money this week, so far as they
i affected the bank statement, showed a loss
j to the banks of $1,700,000. The institutions
gained through receipts of new gold and for
bond purchases, and they also -gained through
the direct interior movement. The loss to the
! banks, however, was largely caused by Internal
1 revenue and customs payments Into the treas
[ ury. which more than offset disbursements by
i that office for pensions and for January Inter
est. The banks also lost through transfers of
money to Xew Orleans. It may "be noted that
the payments by the Treasury for unmatured
bonds were quite small, amounting to only
$214,200, and It seems likely that the offerings
of these bonds to the Treasury will continue
light for the remainder of the year. The bank
statement shows even a gerater loss of cash
than that above indicated. the decrease of
specie being $3,410,000 and of legal tenders
$1,025,200, making a" total of $4,435,200. Loans
were reduced by $13,308,500, making a reduc
tion of $24,546,600 In this item In two weeks.
Deposits decreased $19,200,000. which, with the
decrease in the previous week, makes a total
of $34,811,800. The reduction of $4,765,500 in
reserve requirements last week resulted in a
gain in surplus reserves of $330,300, notwith
standing the loss of cash. The surplus now
stands at $5,785,325. The specie in the bank3
i Is now $3,779,000 below the lowest of the year,
I which was recorded January 5. Compared with
I a year ago, however, the specie is $2,047,800
I higher. The surplus reserve is $573,800 more
than the minimum of thfe year, which was
! $3,211, G25 July C. but It is Ie3s by $3,711,075
than the surplus at the corresponding date in
1000. It seems quite possible that part of the
derangement in loans observable last week was
due to some shifting incident to the payment
of about $30,000,000 for new Illinois Central
j stock and for nearly $8,000,000 of New York
I City bonds. It appears unlikely that the re
j duction of $13,308,500 in this Item was wholly
due to liquidation of speculative accounts on
the Stock Exchange, and hence it is fair to
assume that the large transactions such as
i above were responsible for the decrease. There
I still doubtless will be an increase in cash and
in surplus reserves after the beginning of the
new yrar, judging from such movements In
previous years. In January of the current
I year there was a steady gain In cash each 1
week, and by January 2G the cash had been
augmented $33,267,600 and the surplus had in
creased from $14,150,075 on the 5th to $30 793 -
450, the maximum of the year on the above
date. In this interval loans were expanded
and deposits rapidly rose toward the $1,000 000 -
000 mark, which was reached February 16. '

CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â Trade . In the wheat pit
was good throughout the short session and the
tone ruled uniformly strong. â  News, was bull
ish, and there seemed to be much the same
sort of market that started the big bull move
ment two j weeks ago. Cables were well ad
vanced and the foreign demand. both here and
at the seaboard was considerable.- \ The'general
cash demand picked up materially and commis
sion houses and professionals '.' were buying.
The Impression was present that much of buy
ing was for Wall street. Tills stimulated a
local Interest and sent . shorts scurrying for
cover. Wheat was scarce In the pit all day.

REALTY SALES
PROMISE WELL
Agents Report Several
Large Transactions
During Week.
Approach of Holidays Causes
No Falling Off in
Purchases.
There have- been so many transactions
of Importance during the present month
In the realty line that the December rec
ord Is even better than had been antici
pated by many of the brokers. Of course
the sales of the William A. Piper proper
ties, all of which brought very good
prices at the auction rooms of G. H.
Cmbsen & Co., tend to swell the total for
December In excess of the regular trans
actions on tKe street But without these,
as the columns of The Call have given
fLmple evidence, the showing In the way
cf prices and in tne total sales would be
satisfactory.
The sales of several properties that hare
been recorded within the past few
months, each of which brought a profit
to the holder of the title, has afforded an
indication of the buoyancy whicli attends
the real estate situation just prior to the
closing of the year. Some facts of Inter
est have recently been given In this de
partment concerning the progress of the
market for realty In Los Angeles. The
costly bulldlng-s tn&t have been, erected
iin the south have made up an approxi
mate total of $4,000,000 In round figures
for the building improvements of the i
southern city for the year running from \
December 1, 1300, to December 1. 1901- The j
complete returns for San Francisco's !
building calendar year have not been
made up yet; but It Is a Elgnlncant fact
that the total of the Improvements in this
city es represented by contracts recorded
at the City Hall during the first six
months of the present calendar year, ap
proximated the figures officially sent out
for 1*03 Angeles as representing the build
ing progress of the entire year as defined
in the foregoing. ... i
The brokers have made some deals dur- j
Ing the past week and some others of re-
Cffft date, withheld for a time -by reason
of prudential considerations, are made :
public by them this morning. j
Taking also the report of the Building ,
Superintendent of Los Angeles, It appears.!
that the amounts expended for Improve- j
ments 1 in Los Angeles during the fiscal |
year from December 1, 1900, to December,
1901, aggregated $4,099,198. The structures
provided for by permits In the period
named are as follows:
Seventy-eight brick business buildlnrs, $680.
Â£3S; 4 brick and etcne residences, $33,050; 018
two-story fraaie residences, $1,425,069 60; 908
one-story frame residences, $939,165 60; 35
Xrazne etores, $42,254; 60 frame flats, $296,375;
6 churches. $55.SOO; 253' et&bles, ebeds. etc,
$44,539; 63 miscellaneous. $301,110; 637 alter
ations and additions, $277,000; 7 repairs on ac
count of fire, $2665; 113 removals, $21,772;
total number of bulldlnffs, 2730.
The comparison shows that the total
for Los Angeles during the year Is ap
proximately $1,600,000 in excess of the to
tal for the preceding year. The following
figures trace the course of building im
provements in Los Angeles for a series

RESERVE GUARD
FOR THE STATES
Synopsis of 'a Military
Bill to' Come Before
Congress.
Brigadier General W. H. Whiteman,
adjutant general of New Mexico, has
submitted a proposition to establish out
of the National Guard of the different
States a United States Reserve of the
Military Forces, which will be submitted
to the present Congress in the form of a
bill. The features are that It provides for
the government of the citizen soldiery
of each State according to the rules and
regulations of the United States army
enlistment for three years, makes the
President commander in chief, provides
that States organizing reserve forces
shall pay expenses, that the Secretary of
War shall require an inspection at. least
once a year, requires the issue of maga
zine rifles and carbines upon the requlsi- 1
tion of each Governor and that the sum
of $2,000,000 be appropriated annually for
the maintenance of the reserve. - .
Plans* are being prepared for work for
the men of the First Infantry after the
first meeting in January, when drills will
be resumed.
An election will be held on the 6th of
January in Company C, Fifth Infantry,
Petaluma, Major Juilliard "has been de
tailed to preside.
The resignation of Fred R. Maulsby,
sixth division of the Naval Militia, has
been accepted. ~ ...
-Lieutenant C. R. Alberger has been de
tailed to preside at an election to be held
on the Marlon for ensigns, vice Murphy,
term expired, and Smith, resigned.
Commander George W. Bauer has been
detailed to preside at an election to be
held on the Marion on the 14th of Janu
ary, for lieutenant, vice Harloe, term ex
pired.
Ten enlisted men have been discharged
from the Naval Militia on account of re
moval and one expiration of term.
At the quarterly session of the Asso
ciation of Veterans of the National Guard
of California last Wednesday night there
was a large attendance and a manifest
renewed interest In the affairs of the or
ganization., Applications to become mem
bers were received from guardsmen who
have recently obtained their exemption.
Adolph Hromada, who eight years ago
was proposed a member of Company H
of. the, First Infantry by Colonel Bush,
then commanding the regiment, has been
admitted to the veterans' association.
The new member has the distinction of
being the first on -this coast to recognize
that candy is an appreciable addition to
soldiers' rations, for when the First In
fantry went into camp, in 1894 he pre
sented to each, company a large bucket
filled with assorted candy. Soire of the
officers atthat time thought it rather a
curious part of the rations, but , Mr.
Hromada was a little ahead of the United
States - army, for in 1898 candy In large
quantities was "sent to the Philippines
by â¢ the . United States Commissary De
partment as part of the rations for the
soldier^' stationed there, r \ "â¢â¢â¢ 'â â "'â¢ v<- â â 'â¢;

GEORGE R. EATON
DENIES CHARGES
Assignee of "Mammy"
: Pleasant Says He
Is Vigilant.
George R. Eaton, assignee of "Mammy"
Pleasant, the Insolvent colored woman;
whose connection with the Bells has
made her famous, has filed an answer to
the charge made against' him by. the aged
servitor and Attorney Frank Stone and
Sam Davis of Carson in their petition for
his removal as assignee of the Pleasant
estate. "Mammy" and her attorney and
Humorist Davis applied to the courts for
the removal of Assignee Eaton on the
ground that he neglected her Interests
and did not press a suit to,, recover cer
tain property In Sonoma Co'unty claimed
by Mrs. Pleasant. Mrs. Theresa Bell
claims the ranch also, and it was to quiet
title to the place that the suit subsequent
ly dismissed at the request of Eaton was
brought.
Eaton in the answer he filed yesterday
denies that the petition for his removal
is made at the request of 90 per cent of
the creditors of the . aged negress. He
alleges that, on the contrary, not more
than 5 per cent of the people to whom
"Mammy" is indebted favor the petition
He claims that he has been extremely
vigilant in guarding' Mrs. . Pleasant's in-
terests. and that he has expended large
sums from his own purse ln caring for
her estate. He also claims that the col
ored woman has thwarted him ln his en
deavors.
He says further that the suit ln the So
noma County courts was dismissed by
him because ho could not collect evi
dence to prove that "Mammy" had any
right or title to the ranch.
