THE ADVENTURES OF
COL. TRAVISOTC Friday evening, June 24. 1SS7. at
about 15 minute? paÂ«t 7 o'clock, a
lire, causing the death of eleven
miners, broke out in the "BoniiT
sha.lt" of tho Gould & Curry mni-j
on tbÂ« Comstock lode. Virginia City. NÂ»v.
This dreadful calamity startled the en
tire coast, .and spread a cloud of sorrow
over ICevacia. . In the darkness of tli'*
night of danger and disaster that hu;i:<
over the Comstock shone the calm, ac
rene light of the star of true generosity.
The people of the Pacific Const were nut
unmindful .cf their obligation. The large
and bountiful donations made to the fam
ilies of the unfortunate men who perished
on the 400 and 1000 foot levels of the
ralnes have attested the sympathy of Cali
fornia and Nevada and placed the be
reaved women and children beyond the
reach of poverty and physical sufOrine.
Tho origin of the fire on the l!VW-foot
level is unknown, but H Is generally sup
posed that one of the minors left a burn
ing candle sticking in the old timbers and
It fell on several boxes of giant poxfder
that hsd been stored, ngainst the express
direction of the superintendent, behind
the station on the 13'*). The giant powder
burned- it did' not explode â and caused a
oense. ' sickening black smoke that rolled
i:p ihe shaft with great fury and s-ici.
filled the hoisting works po densely that
it was impossible to see across the cngln3
room.
At the tima of the fire the 3 o'clock
Fhift, conslstinsr of twenty-four miners,
had sozm down, at the usual time, an<l
the tuen were at work in four different
places underground. The men were dis
tributed as follows, viz: six men on the
1500-foot level, eight men on the 1300. five
on the E09 and live on the 403.
John C McLean was the engineer in
rharKi" of the hoisting engine at Hie
Banner shaft and noticed .the first in
<Mcai5om= of smoke coming up tho t-haf'.
He realized In a moment that a great
calamity was impending and pave the
fire Fisrral. Every man who has lived
in a mining town, where men work under
pround. knows the significance of the
dreadful signal. "The mine is on fire."
In V!rerin!a CJty It is Riven by ten strokes
on a large bell over the hoisting works.
The moment it was given all business
v.a.s ?us;>o;ided and everybody ran to the
Bonner shaft to leurn particulars and
find whether their relatives and friends
were In darscr.
The great mass iof Mack smoke rising
straight up on the calmness of a mid
summer evening toÂ«<i everybody tha.t the
matter was of grave importance and the
street was soon packed with anxious
wives and children of tlie miners working
underground through the Bonner shaft.
One little tot carrying a dinner pail
wailed out "I brought my papa's dinner,
but he cannot come up to gel it."
Every one â young and' old â -In Virginia
City lnÂ»w that great danger faced the
men below. The memory of the. great
Yellow Jacket fire, with Its fearful loss
of life, still remained as a warning of
the danger incident to ths life of a
miner In the deep level*
By the daring and efficient work of
miners from the neighboring mines â all
<'f whom volunteered their services to <Jo
anything, or go anywhereâ the- thirteen
mtn on the 800 and 1300 foot levels werÂ«
"Billy" Scadden. miner, got on the north
cagÂ« of the Bonner shaft and tDld"John
nle" McLain. ihe engineer, to lower them,
to the 1500-foot level to rescue the six
men who" were working there.' Atrthe
time these two men stepped on the cage
the black smoke was rolling out of the
mouth of | the shaft and when they told
"Johnnie" to "drop her fast" in that- dark
place it looked like suicide. Don't you
know that men that could do that must
have hearts of oak arid* nerves of "steel?
Well, they went down that shaft' and it
was three to one they never would come
back. "Larry"" told me that t after they
got below the lights of the 1300-foot level
the cage suddenly shot down into a blaze
of fire. As he expressed It.. "It, was one
blaze of many-colored lights." | He knÂ£w
that in a moment more the shaft .would
be burnt and the cage would not stay in
the> guides. The shaft was one mass- of
fire. Quick as thought "Larry" -jumped
for the bell rope and tri<!d>to. stop the
cage.' After a few. efforts he gave the sig
nal and stopped in . a . circle of fire. . He
rang the : signal * to hoist to the '< 1300-foot
level where seven men lay ; on the J floor
of the station, guessing whether life or
death was to be their fate. â¢ They knew
the chances were against themâ that a
single error was fatal. If "Larry" lost
hlR nerve and gave the wrong, signal! If
Johnnie got rattled and misunderstood it!
Or if either, or both, got so frightened
that they knew not what to do! Would
"Larry" signal for the surface, and leave
the men on the 1300 to their fate when
Belf preservation whispered. "It is death
to stop! Save yourself while there Is yet
lime!" Or if the red demon of fire should
swallow up the cage before It made the
turn! The boys on the 1300 had discov
ered the tire and were waitlns for the
cage. They were crawling like snakes on
the station floor, nearly suffocated by the
heat and smoke* -
In a moment they all got on board the
cage and were hoisted with" lightning
epeed to the surface, where, a new terror
awaited. "Johnnie" had pulled the throt
tle of his engine wide open and the cage
was flying upward with frightful speed.
McLaln knew that nine fainting men were
on the cage and that the angel of death
was in hot 'pursuit, and he dared not
slow down. The, smoke In the hoisting
works had grown so dense that "'John
nie" could not Â«ee three feet in front of
him. - The Indicator, showing the posi
tion of the cage, was totally obscured by
the thick, sickening smoke that rolled out
of the shaft. The alarm bell, showing
that the cage is within 200 feet of the
surface, is rung. In ten seconds more ths
never came. No mining man within hear
ing distance of that bell could mistake
the terrible significance of the eiznt
signal*. "Send down the cage to the UX>
foot level.' 1 How it wrung the hearts or
them who heard It. Every one knew tne
men wire In their living tomb and tnw
was a message from the dead.
A few mining men of Nevada Block ad
mirlr.fr the distinguished bravery of Lor
enzo rinaelia. John tV McLean and I W 11
lUm iikaddrn. caused three magnificent
gold m.iiais to. be struck off in commemo
ration of their heroism on the tvening of
Jure "I tSEl The medals were presented
to these' three men at the TVashoe Club on
the evening of Wednesday July 27. with
this plain request: "It in thewi?h of the
rtonors gentlemen, that you should always
keep thÂ»-j*e medals In memory of the Judg
ment thiit the history of the Comstock
does this day record in your favor: 'In

The medals were made of solid gold and
were beautifully engraved at the factory
of Adolph Hlrschman. San Francisco. In,
size the medal* are larger than the old.'W
time "$o0 slujr," but are round. They areT
alike, except the names. The Inscription*

within thirty minutes alter the fire Btart
*4. The fiinoke from the burning giart
powdor filled the drifts on the- 400, anl
spphs-xlated them. Their names were:
R. C. Bruce. C. W. Carpenter. J. Trounce,
Joncey Morgan and Andrew Bean.
The Fix men on the YM level lived for
at least three or four days â the signal
taps on the air pipe demonstrated this â
and then they perished by starvation,
heat and bad ventilation and the gas
from the smothered fire in the old tim
l>ers. The names of these six miners "were
Edward Gaffney. .Martin Tregallls, John
Kennedy, P. Eddy. Charles Dougherty
end Foss Hamilton. Their bodies were
brought to the surface on the morning of
July 11, seventeen days after the fire.
When word reached the crowd of excit
ed citizens in front cf the hoisting works
that- "all the men on the 400 are dead" a
wall of sorrow went up that was pitiful.
Andrew Bean was a great favorite in
Virginia City, and the arrival of his wife
and eight children at the tide -of the
stretcher on which his remains were
btoosbt to the hoisting works created a
profound sensation, for their Brief was
uppallins-
1 he five imprisoned miners on the 800
level v.ere rescued by a party of men,
who came to them through an old shaft.
These miners Jiad caved their lives by
making openings -in the air pipe and
breathing the pure air that was forced
from the surface down the air pipe by
the air compressor.
The rescue of the miners on the S00
level left two pangs in the mineâ one of
eeven men Â©ustbe 1300 level and the other
of bIx miners on- the 15M level.,
The rescue of the men on the 1200 level
by Lorenzo Pinaglla and William Scad
den and the passing of the six men on
the 1500 , level Is graphically described' In,
the remarks of George R. Wells In re
sponse ta the toast, "Reminiscences of
the Comstock," at tho souvenir dinner In
celebration of the Introduction of electrio
power on the Comstock ledge, on Satur
day evening. October 20, 1900:
"Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: The
Comstock ledge has played its part in
history, and it will yet make history. It
has had its share of joy and sorrow and
rejoicing and misery. It has been the
theater of noble action and 'true friend
ship, and then It has been the scena.of
treachery and duplicity. Some things
have occurred on this great lode that
make a man feel proud of his fellow man.
The bravery and loyal devotion of miners
to their Imperiled brothers is deserving
of more than a mere passing recognition.
I will briefly refer to one circumstance
that to-day is as fresh in my memory as

From the dawn of civilization' bravery

Inspired by the unselfish triumph of "the
strong arm and stout heart" Is one of tho
touches of nature that makes us all akin.
Of all men that the world has crowned
as heroes, none have risen so high as
those who for humanity's sake- have
sought to save human life. The unselfish
man, who lmperils'his own life to save
that of another, is infinitely grander than
is he who under the impulse and madness
of tattle leads an [ army to Â¦ victory

THE COMSTOCK'S GREATEST CALAMITY
THE FIRE IN BONNER SHAFTrived from Mexican workmanship. Thrf
ono eerlous defect in the latter case has!
always existed In the designing, the most
popular themes running into exaggerated
floral effects and making little of such
vagaries as a rose at the end of a 111 y

The rose, however, under a more Intel*
Ugent treatment, has lost nothing: save
its former incongruities, and, with the
oak leaf, acorn and flowering vine, will
never cease to find Idealistic em
bodiment . In Mexican carved leather.
The supplanting of their old tra
tradltional ideas by designs of a
more cosmlcal nature has, strangely
enough, met with neither disparagement
nor opposition on the part of the original
native carvers; on the contrary, they are
invariably, quick to . > embrace - the new
order of things, and consequently are to
be found In all the factories working side
by side with* their brethren of a latter-day
doctrine.; V â¢' " /V '
'The methods pursued in the carved
leather art are remarkably simple In view

The work, though characterized by the
greatest deftness, is necessarily performed
with much care, as is , evident from the
perfectly wrought raised figures In the
finished product. The variety of the con
ceits Into which Mexican "carved leather
Is worked embraces a multitude of uses
alike practical and ornamental; - ranging
In character from a thimble case to a cell-
Ing panel, and In' cost from a few cents
Into the hundreds of dollars. -
In - addition to the larger enterprises,
which owe their existence to the Western
curio craze â¢ there are - a multiplicity of
smaller pursuits In one way or another
identified with the general , Industry.
Among these are mills for Â¦ the manu

and Btcntcutting works and â¢Â»<ablYÂ»n

phases Is pursued along wholesale lines.
* While the great surplus of California's
curio output Is Industriously gathered In
by the transitory, yet omnipresent multi
tude from other climes, not a few notable
collections have . been acquired by the
more permanent habitants of this section.
Aside â¢ from Â¦ values estimated on a' basis
of miscellaneous associations the Intrinsic

of not a few Innovations, both ephemeral

The author writes very interestingly of
the many odd customs and ways of doing
things so strikingly different from our
practices. He tells of the Chinese river
gunboats..' with their night guard of a
watchman with a rattle to frighten away
thieves; of (he women who wear baskets
filled with hot wood ashes tied around
their waists to keep their stomachs
warm; of the fishermen who catch fish by
having cormorants do the work for them.
The birds dive down and get a fish in
their mouth, but cannot swallow It on ac
count of a string which has previously
been tied around their necks. All the/
fishermen have to do Is to take the fish
away from the birds as they, come up.
If the birds do well they each get a fish
to eat before the homeward trip.
Changsha is estimated by the Chinese
to have a population of over a million,
but Mr. Parsons thinks that these figures
are exaggerated. He further holds that
the population for the whole of China has
been overestimated, and that the country
is by no means crowded.

The story deals with the romance of a
young woman who flies to the colony of
Virginia to escape an objectionable mar
riage, and who finds in that colony much
of adventure and a happy love. The In
cidents of the narrative Include a war
between the colonists and the Indians and
the usual experiences of frontier life in
these troublous times. When first pub
lished the work won the approval of crit
ics and was well received by the general
public, and now that a renewed Interest
has been taken in historical pictures of
life in America in those early days, ' it
can be safely predicted -that the welcomo
given to the now publication will bÂ« even
gi eater than that accorded when it first
appeared.

Arizona. Oklahoma, Indian Territory.

To these are now added the Philippines,

persons born in the Philippines after an
nexation and subject to our Jurisdiction
are citizens of the United states, though
they are not members of the voting body
of the republic."
Having thus disposed of the legal ques
tions involved In the problem, Mr. Ran
dolph proceeds to consider the question of
expediency and of justice, and reaches the
conclusion that we should withdraw from
the islands. On that point he says:
"Withdrawal from the Philippines" will
mean that, having tried the policies of the
world powers* and found them wanting,
\ro purpose to put our strength to better
Use than conquest, to affirm the hope of
a better law for the world than the law
of war, and to Invigorate this hope in all
nations by the example of our own. And
our action will restore to our primacy In
America theVmoral weight It has lost
through aggrandizement in Asia. â¢ â¢ â¢
Withdrawal from the Philippines will re
establish the truth that the strength of
our republic Is not maintained by the
mere enlargement of boundaries nor by
mere addition of peoples. It is founded
'upon the .competency and 'loyalty of the
civic body, and upon the indestructible un
ion of Indestructible States."

In this history of the town, the author
tells of "William the Conqueror's great
fortress, his stages, and his starting forth
for the conquest of England.
In Part II is set forth the romance of
Arletteâ the love of the great Count Rob
ert, father of William the Conqueror.
The treatment of this story was suggest
ed by the models furnished in the older
chroniclers, whose versions of the loves
of Robert and Arlette agree chiefly In
their preference for a fanciful rather than
for the more conventional historical form.
She tells of the quaint old town of
Falaise and its edd street scenes; then of
the Falaise Fair, the famous Eleventh
Century Horse Fair, the greatest of its
kind in Europe, and still in full living.
Her accounts of the hor?e trading, the
fair booths, the vendors, and all the life
and incident^ of this oldest of fairs, are
fascinating.
Few landscapes in the world can equal tha
flat pasture lends of I'pper Calvados. The
proximity of the Â«*-a peoples the sky with float
ing cloud masses, the humidity of Its air giving
to all vegetation a depth of green peculiar to
molj<t oilman's.
Mrs. Dodd writes with the sure hand of
one who feels the Invigorating inspira
tion of the fresh country a!r. Every bit
of color of landscape, of people or of habi
tation is caught and given to the reader
just as it is in all its vigor and bright
ness. Her writing is made yet more con
crete by the number of splendid photo
graphs which lorrn no small part in the
illumination of the text.
In the?e cool, moist plains noise that along
the coast had plagued the air as with tha
clanpor of ,a mighty bell was softened to a
pastoral peace. The company of cows munched
and moved among the grasses. From any one
of the Ilelds one could hear the crow of tha
chanticleer, a note as soothing: and significant
to nature-loving Theocritus as to our own

yards whose open cjurtyards contributed lively

The many readers who enjoyed that
charming book, "In and Out of Three

Conqueror."
Richard Mansfield himself writes the
introduction. Should he bring this
play to California it is easy to prophesy
that all available copies of this edition
would go at a premium. Failing in l.iat,
it Is only fair to say -that the present
book deserves a place on every library
table not only out of respect for Shake

acting version and a splendid specimen uf
bookmaking as well.
Falaise â Th; Town of the Conqueror.
WE have haJ books on China from .
people who have made flying
trips for pleasure through the^
country and from others who
have lived there and have writ
ten for pleasure. In "An American Engi
neer In China" we have a book^ from a
man who went through one of tlie closed
provinces of China under the pay of an
American syndicate "to examine, survey
and it-port on an extensive railway en
terpriFe." When a man Is pent out by an
American syndicate at a grood salary and
with the idea in view that upon his report
will depend the investment of larse suma
at money. It Is sate- to expect that the
rr.an selected will be as competent as any
who could be found for such an enter
prise.
It If not to he said that we have not had
a great many deserving works on China,
but this one is especially so. Mr. William
Barclay Parsons, the author, went
throurh a part of China for the express
purpose of seeingâ and he saw- It was
a matter of bread and butter to him to
allow nothing to escape his trained mind.
One can sec- from the facts and figures
which "he presents tÂ«j back up his asser
tions that he was most thorough. .The
I ook is especially good in the careful pic
ture It gives of the n.ost conservative peo
ple of this conservative nation.
Mr. Parsons' duties took him through
the closed province of Hunan from Han
kow directly south tc Canton, and it Is
of this particular p%rt of the country and
its people that the work treats. Mr. Par
sons was afforded every facility and cour
tesy by the Chinese officials in the differ
ent sections of the country through which
he traveled. This puiced him in a position
to collect feme valuable data. He writes
in a clean, clear styl* â Pimple and entirely
lacking in verbosity. "What he has to say
he says without literary flourish but in
the earnest way of the practical business
man av.d engineer.
His first chapter, cf rorty-three pages,
gives a brief outline of the history of
China as a whole. which y %hlle necessary
by way of introduc'lcn. contains nothing
out of the ordinary- Incidentally, how
ever. It r>r??ents a very clear idea of the
Chinese fcrm of government and shows
the foothold various foreign countries
have upon the empire.
Th<Â» author'* dlFcurt-ioii of foreign con
cessions naturally lead? to the "American
Concession" for hi* pecond chapter. In
this connection Mr. Parsons says:
In the making of Chinese forsljn commerce
and the opening of the country to tra<> and

Eaiwpcaa fovfrnncntÂ« ha* been to f otter and

Ing cf American energies Into n-w channe!* were
developments that were Inevitable. â¢ â¢ â¢ A
fir.grj'.ar confirmation of the movement toward
a broadening out on the part of American capi
tal for foreign invasion was the securing of
the conoersion for the railroad from Hankow to
Canton, consummated by the signing ot the
grant in Warhir.gton in April. 1E98, by Wu Ting
Keng. the Chinese Minister, and by a sin
gular coincidence Ju*t one week before the
declaration of war. which vu to establish the
United States as a colonizing power.
The c^nr-ewlon covers about 900 mllee of rail
way, together with mining and other privileges,
which make it. In value and national import
ance, wcond to no other concession granted by
the Ohinrs-r Government. The projected route
of the railway H.-e]f is frcm Hankow, thÂ«
metropolis at the interior, or, as it li some
timeÂ£ called, the "Chicago cf China." to Can

provino of llupoh. for 400 miles through the
Â¦whole length of the province of Hunan, and

It wo s through this country that Mr.

Mr. Parscns and his party were the first

an object of interest to the inhabitants
as they were to him.
The province of Hunan has an area of
about 75,000 square miles, or half as much
again as the State of New York. -and 't*
population Is estimated at 22,000.000. A

The uniform of the Chinese Â«oldler Is a com
fortable but most unmllitary collection of gar
ments. The ccat, in Its hang, resembles a
cloak with wide, loose sleeves. It Is of a plain
color, with a wide marginal band of another
hue. On the breast and back are marked,
usually on white disks sewed to the coat, the
number of the man. the designation of thp'or
ganization to Which he belongs and his "posi
tion In the ranks. The trousers are of dark
blue cotton, and usually tied close around the
ankles. The queue Is worn wrapped about "the
head, and the whole Inclosed tn a dark blus
cotton turban. Beneath the coat is a waist
coat with ti(?ht-flttlr)fc sleeves projecting about
six Inches beyond the ends of the fingers. The
wearer caa the projections hang down.
From his description of the Chinese sol
dier, however, one can see that th.it
worthy- might certainly cultivate our ad
vanced Ideas, acquired by higher civiliza
tion, to some advantage:
In thinking of the Chinese, especially those In
the Interior, we are wont to consMer them as
uncivilized; and so they are, if measured scru
pulously by our peculiar standards. ' But. on
the other hand, they mieht say with some jus
tice that we are not civilized according; to ths
Â¦standards that they have set for themselves,
founded on an experience of four thousand
years. With ail its differences from ourselves,
a nation that has had an organization for five
thousand years; that has used printing for
over eight centuries; that has produced the
work of art that China has produced;- that
possesses a literature that antedates that of
Rome or Athens; whose people maintain
shrines along the highways in which, follow
ing the precepts of the classics to respect the
written page, they are wont to pjck up and
burn printed papers rather than have them
trampled under foot; and which, to indicate a
modern instance, wes able to furnish me with
a native letter of credit on local banks in un
explored Hunan, can hardly be denied the
rlKht to call Itself civilized.
The curiosity of the Chinese proved m
small obstacle In the path of the travel
ers. It was all expressed in the best of
good nature and resulted in harm to
no one, but at the time it caused the par
ty considerable uneasiness. When the
Americans celebrated Christmas night by
the best American banquet of the regula
tion sort which could be arranged, it al
most created a riot In the little town of
Plng-shui. They were passing the night
In a tea-hong, which opened directly on
the village street, and afforded the rabble â¢
an excellent opportunity of viewing the
proceedings :
Our actions, our songs, our very foodâ but,
above all. our forks and knivesâ were a source
of Inexplicable astonishment to the people; but
when our plum pudding â a thoughtful gift of an
English lady In Hankow â appeared, decorated
with holly and blaring in true Yule-tide style,
a look of terror appeared on their faces. The
climax, however, waÂ» reached when a flash
light picture of the scene was taken. When the
magnesium powder flared up the crowd broke
and ran.
All of Mr. Parsons' anecdotes and de
scriptions go to show the different view
point of Americans and of Chinese. To
them we appear as the barbarians, and to
us they are the ones entirely lacking in
refined civilization. It is all from the way
you look at it. Mr. Parsons is so falt
minded upon these points that it is ea3y
to understand why he encountered no se
rious difficulties upon his trip:
better tended: tea-hong* or large storehouse*,
or, aa a laat resort, inns.
Mr. Parsons' chapter on "Inland Com
munication" shows conclusively the crude
.methods of present transportation and
the splendid field open to the railroad
man; also the great need of improvement
in river trafllc. He is by no means san
guine, however, that the country is ripe
for any marked 'changes along these lines,
Under a chapter on "Chinese Construc
tion" the author points â¢ out that "the
engineering progress of the Chinese has
been along static rather than dynamic
linesâ that is. they have learned how to
construct bridges, erect pagodas and con
centrate their forces to build a wall fif
teen hundred miles long, but not how to
construct a machine, or to do any of tha
things the basal principle of which is
movement." In building he even sug
gests that the beautiful principle of, the
arch is -of ; Chinese origin, and points out.
where their structures are deserving of
great credit both as works of art and ex
amples of practical utility. He found,
however, a lacking in the understanding
of principles of transportation and of
hydraulic machinery, upon' which so much
depends in a country relying upon irriga
tion for a large percentage of its crops..
He says:
If, therefore. I were asked to enumerate the
ment, I should sayâ means of transportation;
hydraulic machinery; mining; and then, those
machines which can compete against a very
low-priced manual labor, and which can. if
possible, enter a flelÂ«J of work not now under
taken, such as electric lighting, or cnfT the
existing fields so as to change the present
conditions without too violent or Immediately
revolutionary effects.
"good reading." ThÂ© last half of It will
appeal to the business man or capitalist
who looks to the Orient* for investments.
Mr. Parsons takes up at length commerce
and commercial relations and shows Just
where the United \ State3 stands in this
light. Â¦
The White Flame.
"The White Flame" is a story dealinf
wltht the occult, which promises well
enough in the beginning but falls rather
flat In the end. The plot offers the possi
bility of a very good ghost story, but the
author wanders in a despairing way tot
ward the latter part of the book.
In the opening chapter It "suggests thÂ«
motive of the story. A young girl comet
to her room, after having been detained
late by company, to find that a stranger
is sitting; in the chair which she had that
day purchased from a second-hand dealer.

Wasson & Co., Chicago. Price $160.)
Of course, in a volume of this size It
is not to be expected that the author can
digress to any extent from absolute biog
raphy. There is no room tor anecdotes or,
incidents which mean so much in convey
ing an adequate idea of character, but as
far as the barer' facts in the lives of each
la concerned the book amply answers the
purpose. . I
In; the matter of period of time the vol
ume 19 complete, for it includes the lives
of all of the Queens of England from
the Norman Conquest, Matilda, of Flan
ders,' to the death, of Victoria, seventh
Queen Reenant. . .
Following out that view to its logical
conclusion, Mr. Randolph argues: "Tha
Philippines are not only within the United
States In a general sense: they are not
distinguished organically from the rest of
our territory. Prior to the treaty of
Paris the common property of the States
of jthe Union called the ..â¢Territory of the
the owner of the ancestor, and yet leave an
attractive profit to the borrower.
The author's closing chapters on the
"Yellow Peril" and "China in the Twen
tieth Century" contain much food for
thought. The main point of interest upon
which he spends some space is the over
estimate of the population of China and
the fact that the yellow terror is not to
bo so feared as some writers wofcld lead
us to suppose. The book is well illus
trated by half-tone reproductions of pho-.
tographs. (Published by McClure, Phil

Law and Policy of Annexation.
Carman F. Randolph of thÂ© New York
bar, author of "The Law of Eminent Do
main." has contributed to the discussion
of the Philippine question a valuable
treatise, "Law and Policy of Annexa
tion," in which he gives due considera
tion to the two phases of the issueâ has
the United States a right to the Philip
pines; is It expedient for the United:
States. to retain them? â¢ >/
Mr. Randolph holds that the. Spanish
had a full right, under the law of nations,
to sell the Islands, and that the natives
have no rights which either Spain or tha
United States Is bound to respect. He is
equally sure of the authority of Congress
under the constitution -to annex the
islands. Upon that point he quotes the
statement of Chief Justice Marshall: "The
constitution confers absolutely on the
Government of the Union the power* of
making war and of making treaties, con
sequently that Government possesses tha
power of acquiring territory either by war
or by treaty."

Still more about "An Englishwoman's
I/ove Letters!" The latest concerning the
authorship of the book is, perhaps, the
most startling of all. It is contained in
the well known Scotch paper, the Dundee
Advertiser. "I have Just had a chat with
a friend." writes a correspondent, "who
knew Oscar "Wilde In Paris. About a
month before his death, when he was very
ill, a few friends met him in his 'room,
where he read them copious extracts from
an MS. which he said had been intrusted.
to him. and on which the writer wished
to know his views. The opinion was
unanimous that the work was of no com
mon quality, and it was decided that the
book, as it stood, should be submitted to
a publisher.
"One of the party suddenly observed,
that a part of the MS. was not typewrit
ten and was In Wilde's writing. He was
taxed with the authorship and admitted
It. but said, rather sadly. 'No publisher
would look' at It under my name. Let It
stand or fall on its own merits as a liter
ary production.' Of the little party who
heard the reading only my Informant's
friend, to whom the manuscript was In
trusted, remains alive.
"Whether Mr. Murray knew of its
authorship when he accepted the hook I
do not know. It was "Wilde's earnest <X^%
sire that the book should appear anony
mously. Now the book is a success, thero
la no harm In giving honor where honor
Is due."
The most Important article In thÂ» March,
Everybody's Magazine is undoubtedly
Bird S. Coler's contribution on the "Gov
erment of a Great City." No one Is more
competent to write on this big subject
than the Comptroller of Greater New
York, whose vigorous protests havÂ© made
him a terror to corrupt politicians. He
deals forcefully with the problems
encountered In the direction of a big mu
nicipality, and his strictures and dicta
should be of value In all the other great
cities where parallel conditions exist.
Among the interesting statements Mr.
Coler makes la one that municipal govern
ment cannot be conducted on the same
lines as the business of a private corpo
ration. The sole aim of the latter Is to

The Southern newspapers have wel
comed "William Hannibal Thomas' book
on "The American Negro" for aa strong
an argument for the repeal of the fif
teenth amendment as has yet appeared.
Mr. Thomas la a nejjro of ability and
character, but rather supports the asser
tion that the Intellectual and moral quali
ties of the negro have not advanced, and
that his material advancement and well
being are not Improved by the possession,
of political rights. This argument la in
violent contrast to the optimism of Booker
T. "Washington, and public opinion In the
South is likely to regard It as an addi
tional justification for taking the negro
out of politics and confining his activities
to agricultural and industrial pursuits. In
their effort to effect some compromise on
the fifteenth amendment both Southern
Republicans and Democrats are reckoning
on much sympathy In the North.
"The Romance of the Heavens" Is thÂ«
title of a popular yet scientific book on
astronomy by A. "W. Blckerton. professor
of chemistry at the New Zealand Univer
sity, which the Macmlllan Company will
publish Immediately. A chapter which,
will probably cause some attention Is that
which deals with the possible Immortality
of the Cosmos. The author has tried to
write a book which with careful reading
may be followed by any person with a
good school knowledge of experimental
science.
Two exceedingly valuable books con

"Mechanical Traction in War," by Lieu

often seized for debt, and the legality of
the seizure might be a matter of Interna

mess ran up several bill* on shore. When
they cam* to settle, before sailing-, a .bill
was presented by a tradesman which the
mess refused to pay, or the reasonable
ground that they did not ow. it. Enow-
Ing that the vessel was to sail shortly the
tradesman rot a sharp lawyer, who pro
cured a judgment against the ?hlp for thÂ®
amount of the bill. A Sheriff came on

Actual Poverty
of the
Tropics.
THAT the tropics are really poor la
natural resources Instead of beinc
rich Is the argument of I>r. Berne
led er of Cordoba, Mexico. Hla ar
guments are especially interesting Ju*t
now, when so much attention is being at
tracted to the hot regions of the world;
as places for exploitation. The doctor, to
a letter to tha Medical Record, says:
"AH men dream of the marvelous rlcnea
of the tropics, of tha birds with rainbow
plumage, of the extravagant flowers, of
the elegant tree ferns, of the banana and
palms with waving leaves and of the coco
palm, which furnishes man with every
thing necessary for life. Indeed, wa pity
him who has never seÂ«n a tropical land
scape as we pity him who has never seen
the sea. Then we think of the enormous
treasures the English. Spanish and Dutch,
have harvested from their tropical colo
nies, and, naturally, we think that the.
tropics are the richest regions of the
-â¢rid. All this may be true. yet. never
theless, in another sense. Instead of belnff
rich, the tropics are fatally poor. Unabla
to secure the necessaries of life, the peo
pled tropical countries are like the man
In whose hand everything turns to gold,
yet who perishes of hunger and thirst
"Of all the breadstuff* necessary for
man the tropics furnish only corn and
rice, and these only to a limited extent.
They have no wheat, rye or potatoes. ThÂ«
banana may be. "as Humboldt says, 133
times more productive than wheat and 44
times more so than potatoes, yet It can
not replace either as food. ! Nor can -white
men live for any length of time on rlca
and corn alone, nor. on bananas and palm
nuts. Native tropical foods can only hold
body and soul together, as they furnish
but little vigor, energy and power. No
machine can do good work with poor f nei.
A. Â¦man who haa neither bread nor meat
cannot get life and strength and push,
from tea, coffee, sugar, vanilla and all
the precious spices. Tropical products are
merely commercial luxuries, and If the
inhabitants of cold cllmea did not buy
them the people of the tropics would lack
the necessaries and comforts of life and
would yet cheke with their own riches.
"If we wish to know the effects of tha
poor diet of the tropics combined . with
the effects of the heat, we have only to
look at the inhabitants of these countries.
As. a general rule they are thin, poorly
built and 'unfit for Intellectual or physical
labor. Occasional exceptions will only
confirm the rule.
"Even the foods which are produced ara
Insufficient In amount, so that the least
Interference with the annual crops results
In famines, as is the case in India to-day.
Indeed. India has always been the land of
fabulous rlchea of a few and of famines
of tho millions. Until recently In tho
cold countries there were none of fabulous
wealth and but few famines.
."Everything In hot countries Is harmful
to man; the ground, the water and the
air, swarming with miasma and vermin,
and with torment- and danger. Life ia as
much a torment aa a pleasure, fer what
ever -makes life Â¦ worth living la Sacking.

A CHAT ON THE CARE OF THE NECK
BY MRS. MARTHA WT WENTWORTH-
A silver fork is the best implement
for the beating, which must be kept
up until the mixture is nearly cool.
A few drops of benzoin tincture or
a tiny pinch of borax will prevent'
the cream from becoming rancid, no
matter how long it is kept, provided
it is put up in small jars, which can
be tightly closed. Both benzoin and
borax. help in thÂ© whitening process
by which the neck is to become beau
tified. ;Â¦Â¦; ,
The flabby throat has always been
regarded as an unmistakable sign of
age. It only came with thÂ© piling up
of years before the advent of thÂ© stiff,
high collar, which threatens destruc
tion to neck beauty before the wearer
has more than reached maturity. It
is amazing to see the faith women
place in ten or fifteen minutes of
massage, balanced against', as many
hours' of flesh torture in Â¦tarched
linen bonds. The massage Is not
wrong,' for it retards the destroying
process a, little, but the only sure
safeguard is the abandonment of all
but soft, loose throatwear.
A dark neck, or one disfigured by
a line which marks the ;; top of the
high collar, has 'often yielded ito a
persistent â¢ treatment of cocoa butter
or olive oil, rubbed thoroughly into
the skin, which is afterward; bathed
in a lotion made of two ounces each

scent and coarseness, however, could
never go together^-they would fall
out at the first crossing. So the girl
who would dream of making such a
choice would naturally be of a refined
type, and to her I make the sugges

passed down from mother to daugh
ter for generations, and it contains
only white wax, spermaceti, almond
oil and rose water. Every woman of
that family has been, noted for her
beautiful complexion, so the virtues
of the cream are unmistakable. There
are no unsightly necks among those
women, for every particle of exposed
ckin is nightly treated with the pure
and cleansing emollient. The propor
tions are' one ounce each of wax and
spermaceti and four ounces each of
cil and rose water. For myself, I like
a pinch of borax in this mixture and
a few drops of oil of rose put into the
perfumed water for a stronger scent.
Rose is an old-fashioned perfume,
but its sweetness has never been, sur
passed by modern chemistry. It re
minds one of everything that is
less, for some of them produce a
healthy growth of hair. Many women
have pet formulas, which they con
sider a grain better for their skins
than any they might buy at the
shops. For instance, I know a family
in which a simple formula has been
of tincture of benzoin. Twice a weÂ«k
oatmeal or Jndian meal mixed with
lemon juice and suds of castile soap
should 'be applied to assist in the
whitening process.
Small, red scars left by skin erup
tions often mar the appearance of a
woman's neck, but they will fre
quently yield to a solution of boracic
acid persistently used and followed
by a liberal coat of good face cream.
To a half -teaspoonf ul of the acid al
low two cupfuls of boiling water and
apply with a sponge. A fattening
lotion is made of one-fourth ounce of
tincture of benzoin, eight ounces of
rose water and four ounces of refined
linseed oil, applied each night 'with a
sponge and allowed to dry in. I have
also known a scrawny neck to yield to
the influence of a good nightly bath
of castile soap and warm water, fol
lowed by massage in olive oil and a
thorough wetting in equal parts of
alcohol. and water.

Now it Is discovered as a matter of fact
that Chinese, being a symbollo toning
has no alphabet; aa long as no attempt
to pronounce it Is made, the written lan
guage la by no means difficult to learn.
The phonetic or spoken language, how
ever, la so variable, and so cut up into
dialectic phrases, that few people, even
among the most learned mandarins, â¢ver
acquire a mastery over them. A Peking
scholar has about aa much, or as little,
chance of understanding 1 a farmer In the
Yunnan province as a London dandy has
of understanding a Welsh miner; but.
when It cornea to writing, thÂ« startling
fact develops that while the miner and
the dandy would not bÂ© able to make
themselves mutually understood in script
the Chinese farmer and thÂ© scholar com
prehend each other fully. ,
This 13 the situation that has led Â«tu
dents of etlmology to consider thÂ» adop
tion of the Chinese as a business and pro
fessional langauge.
Everywhere these men went In China
they were astounded by thÂ© fact that tha
people of the various province*, al
though Incapable of understanding ona
another verbally, were able to communi
cate with ease and accuracy la writing.
As this condition la exactly opposite to
that governing in Europe, where no uni
formly intelligible code exists, these men
began to examine Into- the merits of the
Chinese tongue. They seem convinced
that it Is the most practical language la
the world, and better suited for universal
adoption than any other. They are not
anxious to have it replace existing
languages, but they recommend it as an
International vehicle of business corre
spondence.
They suggest that In another generation
typewriters will be in use which will
transcribe commercial and professional
thoughts to paper, using the hentrac.t
signs of the modern laundry check.
It Is suggested in favor of this method
of â¢ communication that the Chinese
language is almost the one language of
to-day which" is neither changing nor sub
ject to change; that It is written to-day
almost exactly as it was 20UO years be
fore the coming of Christ. Comparing
the Chinese with the English language.
It has changed since the time of Chaucer
until the ordinary reader nnda It a task
to pick his way to the meaning of phrases
ana combinations that were perfectly in
telligible two centuries ago. Research
shows that while modern languages, that
are all phonetic, undergo perceptible
changes every century. Chinese, which la
the only truly symbolic language surviv
ing, is also the only language, incapable
of being changed by tlma. .

A BEAUTY specialist was hold-
Ing forth one day upon the
various methods of obtaining
p.nd holding: beauty, and, incident
ally, commented, upon the compla
cency with which women accepted
scrawny, ugly necks, when it was not
necessary. No other part of the body
responds so readily to treatment, she
averred, as she proceeded to describe
the simple methods of beautifying
the neck. . : ?Jv v ''
If there are hollows in the neck
and throat, they can be filled out by
breathing exercises, head wagging
and fattening oils. The best exer
cise is this: Rise upon the tips of the
toes at the moment of taking a deep
breath, and hold it while yon count
fifteen. Then exhale with open
mouth, and come down upon the
heels. If this makes you dizzy, be
gin by counting: five, then increase
as you gTow stronger. Repeat this
exercise ten times, night and morn
ing, when the clothing' is loose, and
in two weeks you will see an im
provement.
Massage does much for the beauty
of the neck. The muscles should ba
rotated firmly in a slanting direction
from a point under the chin toward
the shoulders, and from the middle
of the throat backward and upward
toward the ears. Always use an
emollient to prevent unnatural fric

The reeult Is that the damp bottle
catches and holds a light film, such as it
would acquire only by years of cellar life.
The final act is performed by the spi
ders. The bottles are placed in a narrow
basket and two or t!".ree energetic spiders
put in with them. The dusty surface of
the bottle offers an excellent .inducement

only a few hours for the bottle to get the
most artistic suggestion of cobwebbed
The fifteen-year-old whisky referred to
was a discovery of Professor Wiley of
the Agricultural Department, as has been
said, when he was collecting the liquors
for the American exhibit at Paris.
It developed during that work that
about nine-tenths of the whisky sold over
the bars of the country had never seen a
distillery, but was what is known to the
trade as synthetic whisky; that is to say,
whisky made up of high-proof spirits,
with a sufficient quantity of water, color
ing and flavoring matter to give it the
appearance of having been naturally
aged.
The alcohol Is furnished by high-proof
spirits, generally known as high wines.
The email black spider which haunts
the tenement rafters and delights in tak
ing possession of the windows in aban
doned stores is the chief medium in the
aging process.
The working spider* are not picked up
by chance, but are saved* from day to
day and week to week and fed with care
and system. The cobweb makers have
discovered that, lacking a sufficient sup
ply of freshly killed files, the spiders will
thrive equally well on a gelatinoua mix

sugar. , -.*

the table in forty-eight hours after it has
received Its cobweb draperies. Conse
quently the labels are ail dipped in a
t-mall bowl of weak tobacco water and
dried on a line over the stove.
The mellow suggestion of age given by
this expedient is surprisingly deceptive
when, one considers the simplicity oÂ£ the
operation.
The labels are pasted and the bottle Is
ready for the finishing touches. This con

FIFTEEN- YEAR-OLD whisky made
In fifteen minutes was one of the
things that was discovered by the
Secrets of Fake Whisky Making.
The color is obtained by the addition of
caramel, prune Juice or some similar
agent, while a very email addition of gly
cerin gives the "head" that is one of thÂ©
first signs that an amateur expert looks
for as he tips his glass up at an angle
and watches the suspicion of oiliness
where the liquor clings to the side.
In making the American exhibit for
Paris the Agricultural Department was
most careful about this feature of the dis
play, and while there was a large number
of synthetic whiskies in the exhibit, their
makers were compelled to classify them
as such, so that there was no misunder
standing as to their status In the exhibit,
and no unfair advantage was taken of
the exhibitors of genuinely distilled
liquors.
All the World May Write Chinese
HINESE as a possible universal
[( business language for the commer-
world Is startling at a first
glance, but there are persons who
reason that It ought to be so. They arÂ»
saying that the lack of the Chinese lan
guage In business correspondence the
world over Is making untold worry and
trouble for nations that are encouraging
international trade.
This Is an Idea that has been evolved
by the presence of allied troops In China.
These troops are discovering that, while

more' intricate than thÂ© Bpeech of Gar
ner's monkeysâ because there is so much
more of Itâ the written language Is sin-
Again, after an injury or ca*
tarrhal inflammation has been pro
duced on the skin or internally,
either by mechanical, chemical,
thermal, electrical or poisonous
agencies, the tissues thus affected
lack vitality and become suitable
grounds, for the development of
germs. The reasons for this lie in
the fact that the skin and the lining
membranes of our internal cavities
are natural protective shields
against disease; wfien these pro*
on sound ' tissue, a point which
should be remembered. But in the
presence of one or several of the
predisposing or exciting causes al
ready mentioned, such germs find
the tissues a suitable soil for de*
vebpment. In fact, they develop
zvherever the blood and glandular
secretions are not in a condition to
destroy them. The blood, glandu
lar secretions and digestive juices
in the healthy have a destructive
power on germs; the absence of this
power leaves the individual sus
ceptible to being preyed upon.
The same healthy condition of the
body has another eventful advant
age: it enables ulcers, wounds and
injuries of all kinds to heal much
more rapidly.
That disease germs attack and
Prey on the human organism with a
facility and rapidity proportionate
to the susceptibility of the individ
ual is a fact generally recognised.
Poor health, nervous debility and
anemic blood are conditions which
constitute this susceptibility, and
are, therefore, like gates open to in
vasion. It is indisputably settled
to-day that a good health is the an
tagonist of the elements productive
of disease. This antagonistic force
is made up of the potential energy
of the nervous system, and of the
vitality of the blood and glandular
secretions. These are our natural
defenses against disease; when
normal, they are capable of destroy
ing most of the germs which find
tlteir zvay into the human organism.
When the blood is sufficient in quan*
tity, good in quality, and is made to
circulate actively by exercise, and
the nervous system is not shattered
by overuse or strain, the individual
may be said to be comparatively
safe from most of the diseases set
up by germs or microbes. If at
tacked, he will almost every time
pull through quickly, or at any rate
have the best of the disease.
The ijicatenation of ailments
and causes should also be borne in
mind. For instance, a sick head
ache arises from a defective diges
tion, defective digestion is often
caused by torpidity of the liver and
constipation, while the most com
mon causes of a torpid liver and in
activity of the bowels are want of {
exercise or a depressed nervous sys
tem, which depression is in turn
most commonly due to summer heat
or mental disturbances, such as
grief, worry, anger, brain fatigue,
etc. ' .
breakdown occurs through their
combined effects.
tective envelopes or linings are
broken or diseased they themselves
are quickly attacked by microbes
and the tissues -beneath are no
longer protected. 'Furthermore, the
presence of these germs interferes
with the normal process of healing,
unless antiseptics are used to de
stroy them.
On the other hand, it cannot be
denied thai certain species of germs
have the power of attacking healthy
tissues. Among these we find not
ably the germs of diphtheria, ty
phoid fever, whooping cough,
measles, smallpox, chickenpox and
syphilis. There is no room for
doubt, however, that even these dis
eases zvill be milder in character,
shorter in duration and less fatal
in the robust than in the weak.
Microbes, in their development,
produce a certain poison usually
termed toxin, which, by being ab
sorbed into the blood, gives rise to
fever, headache and backache as
soon as it reaches the brain and
spinal cord. Hence, fever in dis
ease is an indication that germs are
at work.
â¢ This invasion of bacteria or
microbes is what is termed "infec
tion" or "blood poisoning." In the
popular mind the term "blood pois
oning'* has a significance limited to
infection of a zvound with virulent
germs, but, in fact, all diseases at
tended with fever may be properly
termed "blood ' poisoning" for
poison is present in the blood when
ever there is fever.
â¢ REMARKSâ In what precedes
zve have seen that the causes of dis
ease are manifold and multiform,
and that different diseases vary
zvidely in origin. In addition I
should state and emphasise the fact
tliat oftentimes the disease arises
from combined causes; the cases
are indeed numberless in which one
causative factor could not have
enough pernicious influence to seri
ously affect health, but other bane

In this class are embodied the in

and circumstances which tend to
lower the vitality of the body. By

want. Let these four legs be ampu

diseases, barring those resulting
from accident, are related by their
causes to one or several of the above
four counts. Microbes themselves
depend upon them.

to enable the reader to gain a clear

His tone was ambiguous, but the words

the table, "do you think I ever possibly
could?"

plating my ilushed cheeks with grim de

c.se of a young female of your descrip
tion an introduction to the editor would
complete the matter."
That was how the seed was sown. From
th.it moment I was possessed with but one
ideaâ an Introduction to an editor. If my
personal aj>peaicnce (of which Mr. Grud
tlt-r evidently thought a great deal) waa
Hkcly to impress an editor, how much
greater was that impression likely to be
when combined with my genius? (of which
Mr. Giudder evidently thought nothing at
all). Â«
A few days later one of the journals la
which I'ncle Robert contributed scientific
matter char.eed to contain an illustrated
interview with the editor of the Firefly, a
magazine "crowned with a peculiar dia
drtn" in my eyes, as It invariably rejected
my stories on the comforting plea of
"want of space." From this I learned
that the said editor was young and good
looking (the photograph spoke for* Itself
in that respect), leaned rather toward the
romantic than ihe prosaic side of life, was
poFsessotl of a Keen sense of humor (thers
were lurking lines around the mouth de
noting this); and. above all, had a tre
mendous capacity for recognizing latent
talent in young authors.
The very person I was looking for! The
Introduction once obtained, my future
future was assured. But how obtain it?
Inexperienced as I wasâ and in knowledge
of the world a new born kitten could have
given me pointsâ I yet knew well that to
present myself at the door of the offlcÂ©
in my ordinary aspect, with a manuscript
under my arm and a request that I might
be permitted an interview with the editor,
would be to meet a refusal, polite or oth
erwise, as the case might be.
No. It must be something unusual,
something startling. My commonplace
personality must be concealed beneath
some romantic and fascinating exterior
and the introduction must be casual, not
formal, in character.
The number of disguises that suggested
themselves to me! A fortune teller, a sis
ter of mercy, a crossing sweeper, an es
caped lunatic, a convict, in turn com
mended themselves to my Imagination.
But not one satisfied my artistic senses.
The crossing sweeper took my fancy rath
er, but Uncle Robert's were the only male
habiliments I had to draw upon, and the
patterns were too remotely hideous for
contemplation. Finally. 1 posed before
the locking-glass as a riowcr girl in the
last stage of destitution, and my mind
was made up In a moment.
With the assistance of the milk boy I
smuggled into the house one morning a
profusion of spring blossoms. (Save for
purposes of botanical research flowers
were severely condemned by Uncle Rob
bert.) That difficulty surmounted, I de
voted the rest of the day to my make-up
âthe before-mentioned pose had been im
promptu meitly; the final design was the
result of feverish deliberation and pro
found thought.
I selected for my purpose an old green
frock which 1 bad considerably outgrown.
This was an advantage, my feet being
decidedly pretty. To this garment I de
voted my attention for several hours, in
order to reduce it to a natural appearance
of dilapidation. I tipped the contents of
the cruet stand on it by way of a begin
ning, but the effect on the fabric was
hardly as perceptible as might have beea"
expected. Some applications of French
blacking were more successful, but . a
tincture of Uncle Robert's for removing
warts answered the purpose better than
anything. A few dabs of this brought
about a condition of the sere and yellow

titmed to Â«>ee me. I think they had lost
the power of seeing with the naked eye.
Curiously enough, though, it was one
of these very old gentlemen who inspired
me to undertake the solitary adventure

His name was Grudder, and Uncle Rob

him ae a "master mind." But they shook
their htads sometimes over what they
called Grudder's weakness. "A man
of Orudder's mental caliber should ignore
with Bcorn his rejection at the hands of
a purblind bitdern press," waa a remark
1 overheard one day. From which I aug
ured that Mr. Grudder also had suffered
from rejected manuscripts. Emboldened
by thla knowledge, 1 rushed eomewhat
thoughtlessly into conversation with him
at the next opportunity.
"Mr. Grudder," I began artlessly, as ho

said George decisively, "that's Just tha
sort of ending: editors like."
He was as good as his word. Only a
fortnight afterwards, as I was sitting at
the window In the evening, up dashed a
hansom with Uncle Robert and Georgeâ
"I say, you've let the cat out of the bag
now," said my husband who had been,
looking over my shoulder the last ten
minutes.
"Have I? How?â Oh, I seeâ I'll cross it
out."
"You won't betray me," I said, and tha
air seemed tense with the solemnity oi
my appeal.
The editor came close to me and put
his band softly on my shoulders.
"My dear little girl." he said, looking
straight into my eyes, and he was serious
enough, now, "I wouldn't betray you for
all the world."
After that I told him everything. Ha
knew Uncle Robert. It seemed, quite well,
and he was starting a new magazine, and
Uncle was going- to contribute the science
articles, and the editor had appointed
that evening to arrange about the illus
trations. *
"He's nearly due again now." concluded,
the editor, "so I think I'd better put you
into a cab to avoid a collision."â Really
he could not have been more kind and
considerate if I had appealed to his ar
tistic taste. "I shall get Professor Rowan
to invite me to diner." he said smiling
as he held my hand through the window
of the four wheeler, "and give me a per
sonal introduction to his niece."
"An authoress!"
f "Yes. and my stories are always râre

meant to appeal to your artistic tâ taste â "
iHere I caught a side view of myself in the
mirror and collapsed again.
"But you met with some-of the real ar
ticle on the way. By jove!" said the edi
tor, turning to his desk, and there was no
doubt about his mouth this time. He was
simply roaring. I felt as If I should like
the floor to op^n and swallow me up.
"I'll gâ go now," I said, standing up.
"No, don't," said the editor, swiftly.
"Where's the MS.?"
At another moment my heart would
have throbbed with tumultuous happiness
at the question, but that Image In the
looking-glass was too present to me. No
genius could stand against such odds a*
that. Besides, the event of the evening
had somehow modified my sense of ge
nius. I searched amid my rags and hand
ed him the MS. for which I had braved
and suffered so much. Then I stood si
lently by and resignedly awaited my con
demnation. Â»
The editor sat down at his desk and
turned over the leaves as if he were run
ning his eye down a catalogue. "Crude â
grammar might be worse â construction
atrocious," I heard him muttering to him
self. Then, as he approached the end:
"But you've got imagination," he said,
turning to me, "and that's the great
thing, all the rest will come. Burn every
thing you've written, and don't write any
thing more for six years. Read. Then
try your hand at a novel. You'll do better
with something longerâ in six years." (Â£
did, and it ran into a second edition.) Ha
turned over the last page. "Kathleen
Rowan!" he exclaimed, swooping down
on the name and addressâ Ah!â I begin to

"Nâ no. I belong to quite a resâ res â

"an authoress."
"Friend!" I sat up, my indignation tem
porarily submerging my emotion. "She's
a perfectly hateful person, with dyed hair
and red hands, and she slapped my face!"
"Indeed." murmured the editor, and I
was not sure of his mouth this time. "A
most unwarrantable proceeding, certainly.
What was the provocation?"
"I said I was m-moreâ attractive thanâ
she was."
"It was hardly a remark calculated to
conciliate, if I may venture to say so."
"Itâ wasâ quite trâ trueâ then."
"Of course, but in view of her muscular
superiority wouldn't it have been as well
to reserve the ODinion?"
"It wasâ the lirstâ thin? I could think of
to say."
"Do I infer there was Immediate neces

"Yes. t>â don't you see. They were all

"All? There were others, then, besides

"There were hundred*â allâ listening and

"Dear me! What for?"
"For me to explain why I'd been s-sell

"Oh!"
. "I dâ didn't know. I thought anybody

"Then flower-selling Is not your usual

and he was looking at me very hard.

"Has he gone?" I gasped.
"Evidently." said the editor, reconnoi
teriajr through the dcor.
"You're sure he won't come back?"
"Certain. Not for half an hour at any
rate," -with conviction. "He's a very
harmless old gentleman, though. I can as
sure you. Now tell me what's the matter.
Lean backâ why, you're tremblins ail
over. Who's been hurting you like this,
eh?"
The editor's voice was sympathetic, his
eyes were full of kind concern and his
mouth, at any rate for the present, waj
grave as a Judge's.
Reassured on the subject of Uncle Rob
ert, my mind reverted to the original ob
ject of my mission, and the recollection
plunged me again into a hysterical condi
tion.
"It'sâ all a f-allure," I said, Jerkins: out
the words between my aobs, "and It's all
âthatâ horrible girl's fault."
"What's a failure and what girl?"
"Her n-ame was â Lizâ and. and" I
stopped, chokins.
"Was she a friend of yours?" said the
editor, gently helping roe on.
But I was dumb. All my senses were
strained listening to the sound of foot
steps outside, unmistakably Uncle Rob-
"My" dear child, for goodness' sake be
calm; don't cry like that," said the editor,
alternately administering soothing pats
on my back and searching for restora
tives. "It's all right: nobody's coming In;
nobody shall come in. Tell him to go to
the devil!" he shouted over his shoulder
to the clerk who stood diffidently in the
doorway. "That is. tell him I'll be ready
for him in half an hour if he'll call again.
I'm engaged now. Now what has hap
pened? Tell me all about It." he continued,
as the clerk retreated, dragging up an
easy chair and putting me gently into It.
The next moment I had regained the
perpendicular with supernatural rapidity,
precipitated myself upon the editor's
breast and implored him to succor, help
and hide me.
I think I can without shame confess
that at this supreme moment my self
control gave way and I "fainted in coils."
That is to say, I wÂ«;nt through all the
preliminaries of that proceeding and had
actually executed one coil when a llgbt
tap came at the door, and I heard a voice
say, "If you please, sir. Professor Rowan
would like to see you."
round my neck, scratches of all dimen
sions, some bleeding freely, decorated my
face and hands, one eye 'was swelling
rapidly and my dress, rendered probably
less able to bear the strain to which it
had been subjected by reason of the ap
plication of the wart tincture, was liter
ally dropping from me piecemeal. Of
flowers I had none with the exception of
one daffodil with a long stalk, which
somehow or other had become entangled
in my fringe. In which position It stood
erect and gave the finishing stroke to my
appearance. â¢
The sickening conviction had hardly
formed itself when, as if to add the last
drop to my cup of desolation , I saw my
self reflected in a mlrror^opposite.
Great heavens! the aspect I presented!
My hat, a revolting mass of starting wire
and cardboard, hung in two detachments,
the crown raklshly over my ear, the brim
I tried to answer, but as I met his as
tonished gaze the words fell away from
my lips. . Â»
I kne.w that face wltn the hair curling
crisply on the temples and the lurking
lines of humor round the straight mouth.
It was the editor!-
He turned his head sharply at my tu
multuous entrance. "Good heavens!" hÂ©
exclaimed, rising 1 quickly with undis
guised amazement. "What on earth's the
matter?" ;v .'-.;. ;
I waited for no more. With a super
human effort, born of sheer frantic terror,
I tore my way through defenders and
antagonists alike, bolted down the street
as on wings -of .the wind and headlong
through an open doorway, the first point
of refuge which presented itself to me. A
dim gaslight revealed a flight of stairs, up
which I sprang, without pause for breath,
and finally dashed into a room on the first
landing, where a broad shouldered man
sat with, his back toward me leaning over
some papers at a desk.
It seemed to me as if I had passed years
tossed hither and thither in the howling
turmoil. In reality but a few moments
could have elapsed from the commence
ment of the fray when I discerned the ng
ure of a policeman striding rapidly round
the corner and behind him â horror! thrice
horror!â the form of Uncle Robert peer
ing curiously to see the cause of the com
motion!
It was the signal for general combat.
Polly and the tawny-halred girl fell on me
tooth and nail; the man who had thrown
me the encouraging comment harried
them in the rear. A vendor of matches,
seizing the opportunity to settle a private
grievance, struck out at Sal, and the
medicals who had joined the crowd, un
percelved by me, attacked everybody In
discriminately.
The noise and uproar were Indescriba
ble, and in the midst was I. struggling
feebly in the grasp of the two viragoes,
all my strength departed in that one reck
less blow of retaliation, my hat smashed
over my eyes, my face scratched and
bleeding, and my mind beginning to
realize in nil its Intensity the horror and
disgrace of my position.
Even at this distance of time I can re
call vividly. the effect of that slap upon
me. It was as If every sleeping devil
within me were roused into fury. Every
spark of dignity, all sense of the place
and the part I was playing deserted me,
and without the pause of a second I
struck back with all the strength 1 pos
sessed. = â¢ i-J
" 'Ear, 'ear!" said a voice from the
crowd. "Go it, little -un, let 'em 'ave It!"
"This is a free â¢country."' I went on,,
more boldly* encouraged by this applause,
"and if my flowers command better prices
than yours it is only a proof of their su
perior freshness and beauty" â here I cast
a withering glance at the bedraggled wall
flowers of the tawny-halred girl who was
standing close to me, regarding me with
a peculiarly enigmatic expression â "Possi
bly also," I continued, fairly carried off
my feet by my own eloquence, "by my su
perior attraction as a saleswoman."
The next moment I was carried off my
feet in the literal sense of the words by a
resounding slap on the fu.ee from the
tawny-halred girl.

able putative "sure cures", for seasick
ness I . found that there were but few
.really useful remedies. Among, them I
1 shall' mention strychnine, atroplne, nltro-
several ancient medical writers. As an
example, Rabelais thus describes the pre
parations for a voyage to be made by
Pantagruel and his followers, vis.: "After
prayers a melodious psalm, then a feast;
then all drank; they drank to-all, which
was the cause that none of the whole
company gave up what they had eaten,
nor were seasick with a pain at the head
and stomach, which inconvenlency they
could not so easily have prevented by
drinking for some time before salt water,
either alone or mixed with wine; using
quinces, citron peel, Juice of pomegran
ates, sourish sweetmeats, fasting, cover
ing their stomachs with paper, or follow
ing such other idle remedies as foolish
physicians prescribe to those that go to
sea."
A more modern plan of preventive
treatment, of which I had a largÂ» and
favorable experience while residing in
Australia, consists in the use of remedies
that tend to diminish the reflex irritabil
ity of the vaso-motor nervous system-
There is sufficient evidence to convince us
that the bromides when suitably used
will Induce a decided diminution of reflex
irritability without interfering material
ly with the action of the motor centers of
the brain-that they affect the reflex func
tions of the' cord only, without impairing
the activity of the motor tract. As some
individuals are extremely sensitive to bro
mides this treatment is not advised un
less it Is possible to keep the : patient
under observation lest he become over
bromizedâan unnecessary degree of
chemical restraint. Carefully detailed di
rections for using the bromide preventive
treatment may be found in the late Dr.
Beard's treatise* on seasickness, in which
he incorporated much of the experience
I had gained during several years, of
careful observation. As it is possible for
travelers to obtain all the benefits'of the
sea voyage without suffering the discom
forts of seasickness, it Is quite evident
that it is not a beneficial disease, and con
sequently we should endeavor to prevent
â¢ Its occurrence. In a general way I should
advise preventive treatment Â¦ for suscep
tible travelers as follows: Avoid unneces
sary fatigue by having all the important
preparations for the journey completed
the day before sailing. Avoid heavy din
ners, late suppers and much wine. Get
as much rest and natural sleep -. as â¢ pos
sible, and be on board the ship an hour

A few of the much vaunted remedies, such
as cocaine, nitrite of amyl, hydrate of
chloral, acetanilld, phenacetln and others
of this class, are such powerfu. depresso
motors that, owing to a marked depres
sion of the circulation caused by vaso
motor disturbances already, active, their
use at sea Is attended with no little dan
ger. Alarming symptoms of collapse have
been induced by small doses of cocaine,
antlfebrlne. phenacetin and exalgln.

whom some pearls of nitrite of amyl were
given for seasickness were never after

four to six hours for two or three doses;

Should the abbva mentioned remedies be

In their relations to seasickness Indi
viduals may be divided into three cate
goriesâthose who never suffer from the
malady, of whom there are not more thtyi
3 per cent: another group includes those
who suffer almost constantly and never
loÂ«e their susceptibility, about 4 per cent;
thtn there are those who are- sick for a
few hours at the beginning of a voyage
but finally become accustomed to the mo
tion of the ship and finish their Journey
in comfortâ unless the sea should become
unusually rough or the motion of the ship
'Change materially. As on example of
those who never quite overcome this pe
culiar susceptibility I shall mention the
experience of an unusually robust man,
who, having sailed the seas for more than
fifty years, assured me that, while mas
ter of &( steamship sailing between this
port and Panama, more than eighteen
years, he never left port without being
seasick for at least twenty minutes. An
experience gained during many years of
observation while voyaging over many
searâ a total distance of not less than
900,000 nautical miles â convinced me that
these who "rejoiced In their strength"
were quite as susceptible as those who
had far less strength or endurance.
DURATION.
In making an estimate of this kind the
weather, 6urroundings and suBceptibility
of the patient must be considered. From
one hour to three days may be considered
a fair average, although some travelers
are never entirely free from some dis
agreeable symptoms, even during long
voyages. Prognosis: Seasickness has
never, In my opinion, caused the death of
an individual free from organic disease.
s â¢ . ' TREATMENT.
- The treatment of seasickness is beset
by more than the average number of ob
stacles, peculiar difficulties and" complica
tions. It is usual for good sailors to urge
those less fortunate ' to exercise courage
and force of will, but the absolute power
of "mind over matter" is not exemplified
during a storm at sea.
Preventive treatment was advised by
should become horribly sick during a lit
tle smooth-water sailing on a comfortable
pleasure yacht. In seasickness, as in
many other functional disturbances of the
nervous system, a mysterious Influence
commonly called individual, susceptibility
must play a very prominent role, and
must account, at least in* part, for the
many and varied manifestations appar
ently proceeding from a common cause.
A STEADY Increase in ocean travel
especially between this port and
our newly acquired transmarine
possessions, has made seasickness
a BUbJect of no little practical impor
tance, but In our attempts to investigate
& collection of morbid symptoms gener
ally denominated seasickness, mal de mer,
rea illness or nausea marina, we find that
It is an Illness almost without a consecu
tive medical bibliography. .While It Is
true that Hippocrates, Galen and a few
other ancient medical writers alluded to
It in a desultory way. it Is quite safe to
assert that this malady was never thor
oughly scrutinized by them. Should we
desire proof that this affliction was quite
Â£s disagreeable and quite as much
dreaded in the days of yore as at pres
ent, we may recall the misfortunes of
poor timid old Cicero, who, when worn
out and discouraged by his sufferings, de
termined to fall into the hands of his as
ea&FinB raiher than suffer again the hor
rors of Eeaslcknees. Although an exceed
ingly disagreeable affliction to be endured
for any considerable time, there is much
consolation in the reflection that ita dis
comforts *re soon forgotten, and that It
is rarely if ever attended with fatal re
sults. While suffering from its most dis
agreeable features Its victim Is ready to
"a wear by all the gods at once" that
nothing could induce him to make another
voyasÂ«\ or that he would gladly give a
"thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of
barren ground," and yet a few days on
dry land and all disagreeable experiences
are forgotten.
1 Several modern investigators have given
ue much valuable Information and many
useful suggestions. Still, there Is much
that is mysterious yet to be explained.
That the phenomena involved are com
plex and little understood Is evident when
we reflect that It has net even been ex
plained why a few favored mortals should
never suffer from mal de mer, or why a
much larger number of equally robust
travelers should never be able to travel
without paying tribute to Nepjtune. Again
why some travelers should be made ill by
a rolling: motion of the ship caused by a
beam sea, while others who are proof
against this quickly succumb to a
fore-and-aft or pitching motion. It is also
difficult to understand why old and
prv.-eather-beaten seafaring men, who have
Epent many years on deep-water ships,
both sail and Eteam, and enjoyed perfect
freedom from seasickness In spite of bad
esiclls and disagreeable surroundings.
Hypnotic suggestion enabled mÂ» to af
ford complete or partial relief In several
Instances. An accomplished and well
known medical man gravely assured me
that he had frequently cured his wife of
seasickness after the acute stage had
passed by compelling her attention while
he slowly read aloud th* first chapter oÂ£
the Gospel according to St. Matthew. Ho
admitted, however, that this treatment
might be too powerful for general use.
Having now called your attention to the
remedies and methods of treatment I
found most useful during an experience of
several years I would remind you that
every year â in fact, almost every week â
some remedy for this malady Is brought
out with loud and positive assurances of
its efficacy, only to fall into desuetude on
the appearance of a newer and more mys
terious or fashionable rival. ,
On recovering from a prolonged at
tack of seasickness there is not in
frequently a loss, partial or complete, of
klnesthetlc sensibility, and consequently
as soon as an Inexperienced traveler
feels inclined to move about the vessel he
should be taught to harmonize with his
environment; that to resist the move
ments of the ship Is to struggle against a
vastly superior force, and consequently
he should learn as early as possible to
relax his resistant muscles In order to
assume the loose, swaying walk of an old
"salt," who accommodates his movements
to the motion of the vessel.
As animal foods possess decided stimu
lating properties and are easily assimi
lated when in their use the maxim "little
and often" is observed, they must possess
decided advantages over more bulky and
less nutritious food, especially when it is
evident that there Is diminished energy
of the digestive organs. Beet tea and
chicken or meat broths should be free
from fat. not too watery, and freely sea
soned with Cayenne pepper. Taroena.
made from taro root, is easily prepared
for administration and 13 an agreeable,
nutritious food. Toasted bread or sea bis
cuits, very slowly and carefully masti
cated, will generally be retained.
acn, cause more gastric Juice to bÂ» se
creteu and help to restore the tons of the
enfeebled digestive organs. Such fiery ex
citants as undiluted Worcestershire sauce
should be used. If at all. with caution.
During the early stages of this malady
the patient should not be Importuned to
take nourishment â In fact, he should not
take food during the nrst twenty-four
hours, unless there is a natural desire for
it. as the stomach's ability to digest food
la usually greatly impaired, owing to tha>
loss of its normal digestive, secretions
through much vomiting. â¢ "J
Diminished secretion of urine frequently
requires active treatment â external appli
cation of heat, copious draughts of pure
water, pllocarpine, strychnine or the ni
trites. In persistent Insomnia trlonal is
a. safe remedy In from 10 to 15 grain doses.
It should be triturated with an equal bulk
of milk sugar and placed dry on the
tcngue, followed by several swallows of
water. Do not give the powder until thÂ«Â»
patient Is quite ready for sleep. This rem
edy does' not depress the circulation; there
are no bad after effects, and it will give
a few hours of peaceful sleep. A rare
form of seasickness, with great prostra
tion, swooning, cold extremities, but with
out vomitingâ the form which Browning
describes as a "swooning sickness on a
dismal sea" â requires prompt and vigor
ous * treatment, with external heat, hot
turpentine .epithems, sinapisms, stimu
lants by mouth and rectum, and the usual
measures to sustain the " circulation and
bodily heat. For those who have large
and pendulous abdomens, mechanical con

tight bandages or close fitting cholera

beneficial. Attacks of Indigestion are not

As a rule, stimulants are not required in
the early stages of seasickness. They

positive indications for their use, such as
persistent subnormal temperature, feebls

general debility and loss of appetite.

The Next rioment I Was Carried Off My Feet, In tne Literal Sense of
the Words, by a Resounding Slap on the Face From the Tawny- Haired. Girl.
Grudder floated through my mind. <
Uncle Robert was always away in the
evening, so I had no difficulty in slipping
out of the house soon after six. I had
ascertained from the magazine article
that the editor of Firefly was in the habit
of leaving his ofllce at half-past seven
precisely, and it was my intention to be
in waiting for him at that hour. I had
rehearsed the scene several times. He
would come down the steps quicklyâ a
tall, manly figure with a dark mustache
and dreamy eyes. At first he would not
see me, as I should be crouched in the
fhadow. Then I should rise* up charged
with daffodils and an expression of wild
despairâ I had decided on an extremely
tragic pose as the most effective â and he
would be spellbound with admiration. I
was sufficiently acquainted with tfro as
pect of the ordinary, flower-seller to
know that I had struck an original line.
He would buy my flowers, and as I
pinned them in his coat, upon which at
tention I relied to afford an opportunity
for conversation, he would murmur a re
spectful.comment on my misery and place
himself sympathetically at my service; I
had my best story in my pocket, and the
rest would be easy. ,
I took my seat In the omnibus with
some trepidation. I was afraid least I
whose candid admiration ",."*d not terrify
me, although I -crushed -unmercifully his
feeble remarkB upon the weather. Soon
customers poured In plentifully. At first
I treated one and . all alike with a cool,
business-like air. But after a while I for
got, my shyness, the humor of the expedi
tion took possession of' me, and it oc
curred to me that I might as well rehearse
a few of the glances which I Intended for
the benefit of the "Firefly's" editor later
on. Â« <
' This I did with such effect that before
I knew where I was I was having a sort
of triumphal progress Â¦ down the Strand,
doing a roaring trade and putting up my
prices from desperate necessity every
moment for fear I should reach George
street with an empty basket. My trade
was exclusively with the male sex,
women for the most part eying me with
scorn and passing by on the other side.
With the exception of one brawny female,
a rival flower seller, who dug me aggres
sively with her elbow as I distributed vio
lets at a shilling- a bunch, smiling viva
ciously the while, to a party of young
medicals.
The only other of my own sex .who ac
costed me was a pale, sad-eyed woman in
black, with a face like a Madonna, who
swept up to me and claeped, my hands
kid bin sellln on owld rawlly s beat. See
er! there she is. Ketch 'er hup. Ol'ia

I looked wildly around. One woman had
sunk exhausted on the curb, but the other
waa upon me, and a third, a wiry-lookingr
girl with a tawny fringe dipping into her
eyes and some draggled wall-flowers in
her hand, darted toward me from the
road.
Desperately I dived between the passers
by and fled down a side street but the
tawny-fringed girl was on me in a mo
ment and had grabbed me by the arm. I
struggled to free myself, but I was like a
baby In her hands, and she held me
pinned against the wall.
"Naow, then, wot's th' raow?" she said,
as the other woman arrived on the scene,

A PERSONAL INTRODUCTION
7â¢ And again- women do not have to cut
their hair. Many people believe that cut
ting Is good for It, but the best heads of
hair I have ever seen: are those to which
the scissors have never been applied.
First, men do not take such good care
of their. hair as women do. Women must
of necessity brush out their hair in the
morning and at night, else it becomes a
mass of snarls. . .
Custom demands. that we dress our hair
in certain styles and .not allow it to blow
in the breeze as does the Indian: ' then
common sense should tell us. that nature
should be assisted by us to overcome, the
infringements en- the rights \6t : the hair.
We can not mistreat the body or the hair
and expect good results.' '
Why are men more troubled with bald
ness than women?
My lady should take out. the pins and
combs from her ha,lr when she. has an
hour in her boudoir and allow, the' sun to
shine on her head, occasionally running
her fingers through and lifting the hair
up so that the air can get at the roots.
The hairâ the long : sufferlng hairâ how
little attention is given to it!
We keep late hours "and eat late rap
pers and keep our scalps from the air
and sun. ' : .
The primitive man Is not troubled with
baldness. It Is a bane of clvllization/The
sun and air are his; hair tonics. He rises
and goes to bed with the sun.
When the hair begins ,. to fall out the
seat, of the trouble should first be sought
and then corrected! along natural, sensi
ble lines. We must "aid nature to correct
the fault, "Â¦ and nature always responds
plentifully to any encouragement we give
her. Â¦'
We are In a manner,, by the hothouse
lives we live, thwarting nature.
This is on the face of It an Impossibility.
Hair diseases are as many and varied as
diseases of any other "part of ''the body.
Until the root Itself is destroyed the hair
will try to reproduce* itself. v ,
All.of the diseases of the. hair ha\ye their
origin In the sebaceous, glands. â¢
Either the blood 'supply Is not sufficient
to give enough â¢ nourishment ! to ;' these
glands, and' they dry up, causing the lit
tle' round flakes of dandruff, or perhaps
these tiny elands secrete too much, oil,
and In . that case ; the flakes of dandruff
are large' and oily. .Both troubles loosen
the hair at the roots.' â¢Â¦
They warrant to' eure any and all, dis
eases of the hair by â¢ the same medicine.
Baldness, dandruff and excess of oil were
warranted cured out of the same bottle.
. Arotary movement can.be given with)
the fingers- of both hands along the hair
line in front where the ,halr is thin. i
The masseuse should be' Intelligent. ShÂ«
should know why each movement Is given
and Just what It is to accomplish. She
should* study the growing hair Just as a
horticulturist would his garden.
All scalp massage should be don* from
the finger Joints, wrists or elbows, and
never from the shoulders.
..Parting the hair and shaking each
strand i out separately ' is refreshing and
Is often as beneficial in its cleansing as
a shampoo,' as It removes every scale of
dandruff and every particle of dust.

The scalp should be grasped at the tenvl

hair falls out first are on the temples and

Ivory From Other Animals Just as
Good as Elephants' Tusks.
* LEPHANTS are no longer the only
animals which can produce ivory.
. . according to the official decision of
the United States general apprais
ers. Ivory dealers and those who work in
the material have known this for a long
time, but the makers of the tariff do not
seem to have been so well posted. Testi
mony from Ivory dealers was introduced
at the Investigation to show that the
tusks of the hippopotamus furnish Just as
rood Ivory as do any of the twenty-five
different varieties of elephants. It was
also shown that the boar, narwhal, right
whale and alligator were producers of
ivory. Even the Western hog gives up
many an Ivory tusk to the butchers in
Chicago packing-houses.
The Ivory question arose a few weeks
ago, when an Importing firm tried to
bring In a consignment of umbrella han
dles made of hippopotamus teeth, says the
New Tork Tribune. The importers ob
jected to paying duty at the rate of 35 per
cent ad valorem, which Is the Ivory rate,
and contended that â¢ the hippopotamus
teeth should be assessed at 20 per cent, as
they were mentioned' in. the tariff. The
decision was against the importers.
This does not mean that there is no dif
ference between elephant ivory and hip
popotamus Ivory. Ivory workers who un
derstand their vocation can distinguish a
difference even between the various kinds
of elephant ivory before It has been pol
ished and worked over. When It is carved
often experts can determine from Just
what animal the Ivory originally came,
but the ordinary purchaser can see no
difference.
Hippopotamus ivory answers every mcr-
The long, thin, yellow tusk of the nar
whal does not bring nearly as, much to
day as It did 150 years ago. . This is due
to the passing of superstitious ideas re
garding this Jvory producer of the sea.
A century ago people believed that the
walrus was connected with the fabulous
unicorn, and the horn or tusk was sup
posed to possess many magical virtues.
For instance, it was regarded as an anti
dote for all poisons,- and- Kings- kept a
horn in their dining-rooms, believing it
would warn them if their food had been
poisoned. The tusks were worth, thou
sands of dollars in these times, but the
whalers and hunters of the north are glad
to sell them to-day for $75.
When manufactured Into small articles
the hippopotamus ivory brings Just as
much as, any other kind. As far as that
goes, however, the tusks of the American
hog bring more than does any kind of
Ivory If weight alone is considered. If
they were sold at the regular ivory rate
of 14 a pound they would bring about 4
cents each. They are sold by the^ piece
and average 25 cents each. The pig teeth
are hollow, but will take a very high pol
ish, and can be used in many ways. It Is
said that 20 per cent of the hogs killed
produce valuable tusks. r T''< : '*
This is a mistake, unless from long ner
lecf the halrbulb or root is dead. If it Is
not dead, massage- will supply the roots
with nourishment by bringing a good
blcod supply to the scalp. The sebaceous
glands give to the hair its gloss and
smoothness.
The hair is a piant, consisting of a root
which is implanted in the scalp and an
elongated shaft which projects from the
root. A good blood supply, then, to feed
nourishment to the rootsâ this is the se
cret of good, healthy hair.
Not long since salves and lotions were
looked upon as the sole sources of re
newing hair.
Fakes and quack doctors have made tha
people lose faith in the possibility of re
growing hair.
cantile purpose so far as It goes. That lc
Is not considered as valuable as elephant
ivory is due to the fact that it can be
used only for smaller articles. The hippo
potamus teeth received In this market
weigh from one-half a pound to three or
four pounds. The elephant tusks range in
weight from 100 to 250 pounds. Narwhal
tusks range In weight from five to twen
ty-five pounds. c ). \l :

I / mon thing in the world, taken in
I I *\ doses to suit â this is the cure.
The number of bald-headed
men *ls increasing alarmingly.
Baldness is not confined, as of yore,
to old age. but how many of our young
men about the age of 30 begin to grow
bald either on the temples or on the top of
the head!
Look around â how few really good
heads cf hair you -see!" â¢
Overwork, mental strain, want of exer
cise and bodily diseases soon make them
selves felt In the hair. ; Nervous diseases
and dyspepsia affect the hair very
Quickly.
It is a common belief among men that
the hair ence lost can never be regained.
Rubbing the scalp and massaging the
scalp are two very different things.
Rubbing is on "the Bur face, but a scien
tific'masseuse presses down on the scalp
and firmly but gently moves the scalp it
self.. The weight of the flngera and the
force employed should be adjusted to the
patient's needs.. Some people have very
sensitive scalps and a hard massage
would make the scalp ache for .days.
When the new hair appears a kneading,
rotary motion is the thing and great care
should be taken not to rub the scalp
where new ha'.r is growing as the new
hair 1b sensitive and must be coaxed
alongâ not treated - harshly.
â¢For bald heads the heroic massage Is
necessary to' bring the blood to the sur
face, then a stimulating tonic should be
applied â¢with an easy rubbing motion and
allowed to soak in.
The first thing to do, Is to loosen the
tightened scalp, for when the scalp grows
to the head, that is a sign the blood ves
sels and tiny capillaries are stilted and
i ah not bring the proper blood supply to
the starving hair, so it dries up and drops
out. ~- â¢ Â¦ ' .,'.'
Like everything else there Is a right
and a wrong way to massage.
"Have a squirt of tonic V asks the bar
ber, and the well meaning hair Is squirted
with bay rum and alcohol, which Is ruin
ous. ..-.'-..
* A'^good tonic does the hair -worlds of
good, but first the scalp must be mas
raged to get the bulb In a receptive condi
tion. . .
The hair, when It persistB in falling out,
should be examined scientifically. Treat
the_halr with as. much respect as you
would any, part of the body that troubles
you. 'Â¦'Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ 'â¢Â¦Â¦'..' .
"With men custom . demands , that the
hair be. worn short, but 'it should
be left from three to five Inches long at
least. Men are beginning to realize this
at last. The closely shaven head of a
few years back Is now seldom seen and
the football head of hair that used to be
laughed at Is now looked upon with
envy. â¢'.
â¢ The barber with his shears is an enemy
to a healthy growth of hair. The hair
grows by a budding down process. When
the hair, Is cut for a while it does grow
faster, as nature puts forth all her effort
to â¢ make up * for what has been taken
away. The strength of the papilla goes
into the hair.

The cat as well as the dog may trans
mit certain diseases to mankind. It Is. In
fact, liable to -~ tuberculosis, eczema and
other analogous affections that rage in
mankind. From its moCe of life, attached
as It is to thb fireside, it readily accepts
the caresses of its owners, and lived be
side them; It likes to sleep In soft places,
and if It carries upon It certain jcercns or
parasites It leaves them behind It.
Generally speaking though more fre
quently in large cities than In the coun
try, dogs continually live beside their
masters, whom they scarcely ever leave,
breathing the same atmosphere and con
tributing to so'-- extent to render It
mephitlc. by diffusing into it miasma, and
perhaps also specific agents of malaria,
that are transmissible to mankind. This
being so, it Is not surprising that men
should be at times wet with the saliva
of a dog who has gone mad. or that a dog
should become tuberculous through living
beside a consumptive master, and subse
quently cause contagion in the opposite
sense.
By reason of the close and often con
tinuous contact between animals and
mankind, doss, sometimes affected by
contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis,
hydrophobia, mmnge, eczema, etc., are fre
quently the objects of such affection on
the part of their master that he will take
them in his arms, caress them in various
ways, and allow them to Jump upqn'his
knees and lick not only his hands, but his
face, and even his lips. Sometimes, also,
the does in a house live like veritable
boarders, side by side with the children,
whose food they often share: they even
eat off the plates used by the family.
'. Nervous persons have less hair than
phlegmatic persons. Brunettes have as
a rule less than blondes, blondes having
about 40 per cent more hair to the square
Inch than brunettes, and of a much finer
texture, except the peroxide blondes.
And this brings me to the subject of
bleaching the hair. S The effects of per
oxide upon the hair are to always make It
fall out in the long run. Although for a
time the hair may seem to flourish, after

there Is also a' presence of angina with

Is sufficient to warrant measures of pre
caution in that respect.
Besides diphtheria and pseudo-mem
branous angina birds have other dis
eases as to which there can be no doubt
of the possibility of their transmission to
mankind. It Is sufficient to cite avUrUn

tuberculosis.
Having exhausted, or nearly exhausted,
this long list of contagious diseases ot
small animals which they are eapable of
communicating to mankind. It remains to
consider the general prophylactic meas
ures that should be taken In respect to
them.
Tuberculosis in the dog, cat and bird
must be regarded as among those conta
gious maladies which. In the Interest of
the public, call for slaughter by order of
the authorities. Such a course is neces
sary because, according to the present
researches of science, there is a complete
identity between the determining agent
of tuberculosis In man and In the dog and
cat; because tuberculosis In fowls and
the parrot tribe only differs from human
tuberculosis in certain small points which
are merely accessory â In other words, tu
berculosis of the dog, cat, fowl and parrot
can be communicatedâ and, last, because
the passage of tuberculosis from birds to
man may be effected by the flesh of some
of them which hÂ© uses for food, also by
food that birds may contaminate with
bacilllary products. In addition to Immedi

the labors of the laboratory have estab

"How mudx'd it cost me?" asked th*
Old Groceryman, staring about In search

"A hundred dollars would do It neatly,"
suggested Roosevelt.
"Well." said, tha Old Grocrvnan re

It perhaps"â And ha looked doubtfully

$120 and we'll spend the other J100. I'll
get the check cashed. In the morning."
"Well," asked the Bad Boy, aa the Old
Groceryman, a trifle worse for wear, can
tered Into their rooms an hour later, "how
does gay life at the capital strike ycu?"
"Fine! Fins as silk!" hicconched the
old man. "But I'm kind of sorry for poor

TIIE SUNDAY CALL
PECK'S BAD BOY AND THE GROCERYMAN GO TO McKINLEYS INAUGURATION
AND COME OUT 150 DOLLARS TO THE GOOD
MR. BOWSER'S TRIBULATIONS
(Copyright. jW; by the Pr<-?s Publishing
Company. Now York World.)
*y^f VESTIBULE ti<.in was drawing v
/ | out of the big Pennsylvania sta-
I I tlon In Jersey City and two luÂ»
II urlous seats of the middle car
were occupied by the Bad Boy an.i
the CM Groceryman, who were leaving
New York for a flying visit to Washing
ton to witness the mauguraticn ceremo
nies.
When the Bad Boy had suggested the
trip and the old man had read how a
procession would Â«to from the "White
House to the Capitol, where President
McKrniey would delivei an address an !
again take the oath of oftice and how a
similar oath would be administered to
Theodore Roosevelt, and how great i a
crowd would be present at the gorgeous
#pÂ«ctacle the Old Groceryman had eager
ly assented to the, proposition and had
packed his carpetbag to overflowing wltn
â¢II the clothes be had on hand or could
afford to bui-.
The Bad Boy had advised him particu
larly not to omit taking his home-made
Tuxedo Jacket and red jind r>urple barren
drees shirt. In case the President shouM
hear of their presence in Washington and
â¢hould Invite them ..o tea after the inau
guration.
"What did you say they call this
train?" the Old Grocer j man was askir.-r
as the locomotive pulled out of the cave
like station ehed.
"The Congressional Limited," re pile i
the Bad Boy. "You see. only members of
Congneaa are allowed to ride on it. aal
only a limited number of them."
"Byt how did you rr.ar.age to sneak in?"
asked the Old Groceryman. and he glaneod
furtively about him as if he feared he
might be thrown oft.
"Oh. that's all right," the Bad Boy as
sured him. "I told the folks at the ticket
ofiHee that you were Senator Allison and Z
was Congressman Bailey. When the con
ductor comes around we must remember
to talk very loudly about the billion-dol
lar session and the defeated ship subsidy
bill."
"But what is that session and bill thing
anyhow?" queried the old man. "le It a.
dog cr a bird or a patent medicine?"
"If I should tell you just what they
are." answered the Bad Boy, "you'd know
more than half the Congressmen do. Look
out! Here comes the conductor'."
"As I was sayin'," declaimed the Old
Groceryman, loudly, as the ticket-punch
er reached them, "that there "William
Shipsubsldy won't last half a round
against eld Billion Dollar Sessions. He'll
get a g-ood old soaking uppercut on his
solar system and a right counter on the
Jaw, and then everything will be over
except the shouting."
"Say," whispered the conductor to the
Bad Boy. "I didn't know the Washing
ton asylums v.-ere so fine that they
brought funny-house candidates ail the
way from Xew York to put them there.
J s'pese you're his kejjper?" .
The Bad Boy nodded mysteriously, and
the Old Groceryman, who thought the
whisper expressed some 6ort of doubt pÂ«
to their position as members of Congress,
went on loudly:
"Yes. Congressman, President McKlnley
Bays to me only last week: Senator Alli
son, you've just got to come to my Inau
guration. Why, I wouldn't feel prooerly
inaugurated without vou was there."
With a sympathetic shake of the head
the conductor passed on, and -the old man
turned to the boy and chuckled gleefully
at his own skill as a gay deceiver.
"What are they inaugurating McKin-
Icy over again for anyhow?" he asked
after a while; "didn't it take the first
time?"'
"Oh. yes. It took all right," the Bad Boy
appured him. "It took everything in sitfht.
But he thought Roosevelt might feel
lonely being inaugurated all by 'himself,
fo he consented to do it over again, too."
On their arrival at "Washington they
were driven to the Shoreham Hotel,
where the magnificence of aH the ap
pointments failed to impress the old man,
who was fresh from the atmosphere of
the Waldorf and other New York cara
vanseries. x
"What did you say was the name of this'
tavern?" asked the Old Groceryman as he
and the Bad Boy were dressing for dinner
"Tavern?" echoed the Bad Boy. and hU
face manifested horrified surprise. "Did
I understand you to refer to this mansion
as a tavern?"
"Hotel, then." corrected the Old Gro
ceryman.
"Worse and more of It," crlÂ»d tho Bai
Boy. "Do you mean to say you doa't
know where you are?"
"Whyâ why. at some sort of hotel, of
course; but I don't know the name."
"The name." said the Bad Boy with
strong sarcasm. "Is the White House.
You may possibly have heard the name.
It's the little cottage where President Mc-
Kinley lives. I brought you here as a sur
prise. You know, of course, that on the
eve of every inauguration the President
has a grand house party made up of all
the Congressmen and Government oVn
clals and their families at the White
House. Or may be you never heard of
that custom?"
"Oh. yes," the Old Groceryman hastened
to assure him," fearful of making a new
break. "Of course I remember reading all
about It. Only I wondered how it was
that you and me was invited."
"Because we're Senator Allison and
Congressman Bailey, cz course," an
swered the Bad Boy. "And now come on
down to dinner, and I'll point out the
celebrities to you."
A portly head waiter with little side
whiskers ushered them to a table in the
dining-room, and as they followed that
functionary the Bad Boy explained that
the head waiter was Mark Hanna, who
was in charge of ail the arrangements
at the President's house party. The Old
Groceryman rushed up to the amazed
waiter and grasped toth his hands.
"Pleased to meet you:" he exclaimed.
"Proud to make your acquaintance! Take
me and introduce me to President M:-
KXuley. won't' you?"
"Hush," whispered the Bad Boy, with
a wtak at the head waiter. "The Presi
dent can't see any one just now. He's
in his room busy writing his Inauguration
address."
"But I thought Mr. Hanna wrote all
his addresses and speeches and things
for him," expostulated the old man.
ritfht hSuse. rou are useo. to a good bed
and a dainty table, and you desire to
meet congenial people around the festive
board."
"Exactly, ma'am, and Providence seems
to have guided my footsteps. I am sure
we shall get along famously. I'd like to
fend my trunk over during the day and
be here to dinner.
Mr. Bowser sent his trunk over and
turned the cat outdoors, and that even
ing he. "Joined." Ht was just in time
for dinner. For a.i hour past he had
been thinking of oyster' soup, porter
house steak. French fried potatoes and
Mocha coffee, and he sat down with an
appetite. Soup w*Â»s brought him. It was
thin soup: it was watery soup;.it was soup
which tasted of nothing in particular. He
sipped a spoonful and glared around him
at the "family" and realized that he was
In for a row. There was steak, but it was
not porterhouse; there were manned pota
toes, but they were full of lumps. Mr.
Bowser chewgd at his meat a moment,
tasted of the potatoes and then leaned
back in his chair. Had Mrs. Bowser been
there she would have felt the earth trem
bling and hastened to prevent a calamity,
but the landlady saw no signs. When she
saw that Mr. Kowser did not eat, she ten
derly said: -;',-.'Â¦ "...
"I suppose, poor man, you are thinking
of the wife who Is far away, and so you
have no appetite?'" .
"Madam, is'this-what you were pleased
to term your festive board?" he queried in
reply as -he waved his hand over the
table.
"Is anything wrong?"
He was about to reply that, there was
and to give particulars when the "fam
ily" froze him Into silence with their
looks. There were eleven of them, and
they were "agin" him to the last one.
Realizing the situation, he rose up as
calmly as possible, left the room and went
up to the newly papered room with south
ern exposure. . The landlady followed. It
was her duty a3 the^head of the "family"
and a motherly woman to comfort the
disconsolate.
"You arid \ your wife haven't been
parted very often. I take it?" she said as
Mr. Bowser opentJ the door to her. .
''Look here, woman, what sort of a hash
house do you call this?" he demanded as
â¢he turned on her and instinctively looked
around for the cat.
'[Sir! Sir Ms it possible that you ara
speaking to me?" she dei.*.anded.
"Of, course I am! Do you expect that a.
man who has ever had a home of his own
can put up with such fodder as was placed
before me? That soup was slop; that beef
came from a neck Diece. Your slcvenJy
cook did not half mash her potatoes.'
Why, if my cook had dared to set aucb a
meal before me I'd have â have" â
"You are intoxicated, sir!" she Inter
rupted.
"Bosh!"
"Then, sir, there Is no excuse for yotrr

"Never mind. your theories, sir!" Inter
rupted the "mother of the family" as sha
waved him out of the room and along the
hall and downstairs. Tho other boarders
had gathered to sea the kicker depart.
They were tall, thin, cadaverous board
ers, and most of them two weeks behind

"I was going of my own accord," replied
Mr. Bowser, who wanted to kick over
chairs and jump at the cat. "I have al

Bowser an he passed. When the door had
closed behind him with a bang and he had
descended the steps he looked around ac
the darkness and thought of Mrs. Bowser
and home and the cat, and a tear gath
ered in his eye and ran down his nose.

LENT not only offers a longed for

gives an opportunity for a welcome

by those abstaining from meat on ac

others without religious leanings.

Â¦Wasnlngton's Surprise,
You know that the up-to-dato icecream
Is baked. There are ways and ways of
doing this. Here Is one called 'Washing
ton's surprise. As In all of these formu
las, a thick meringue is at the bottom of
the trick. It forms a crust that bakes
firm and brown, leaving the icecream as
cool as a cucumber inside.
Place a mold of icecream on an Inch
layer of sponge cake, heap with a thick
meringue and garnish with candled cher

simulate leaves, and stems. Set in hot

Prunes in Wine Jelly.
We have been accustomed to look upon
prunes as a pious form of dissipation,
very good for the health and very cheap.
We are apt to associate them with Sa ;
xnanthy's best bib and tucker and the
minister coming to tea. Here is a new
point of view, however; they are being
used with wine Jelly as a swell dessert and
you would never know them for the same
old prunes.
Soak one box of eelatin In half pint
cold water for five minutes; add one quart
boiling water, one and a half cupfuls su-
fusing methods for preparing this dish,
but a simpler recipe is as follows:
Plunge a large lobster, or two of med
ium size, into a pot of salted boiling wa
ter and cook until the shell is quite red.
Then take it from the water and cool.
Remove the flesh from the shell, rejecting
the soft fins which He close to the body
vnder the legs, the stomach, which is in
closed In a hard membrane back of the
eyes, and the intestine. Save the coral
and green fat. *
Cut the flesh of the lobster Into small
pieces. Put on the flre a saucepan con
taining two heaping tablespoons each of
butter and flour and stir them together
until they bubble. Then gradually add
three quarts of boiling water, stirring it
until the soup Is very smooth. Then add
the lobster prepared as directed. Season
the soup highly with salt and "red pepper.
Boll for two or three minutes and serve
hot.
Lobster a la Newburg Is a good substi
tute for the usual flsh course and Is made
from the meat of two lobsters cut in small
pieces. Put two ounces of butter In a onn
over the flre and as soon as It melts put in
six finely chopped button mushrooms,
which must cook three minutes without
browning. Then add the lobster meat and
half a pint of sherry wine. Let this cook
for three or four minutes. Then mix one
and a half cups of cream with the yolks
of four eggs and mix well with the lob
ster, allowing it to remain over the flre
a few minutes without boiling. The mush
rooms may be omitted If desired.
-Mussels are a much neglected sea food,
although capable of preparation in many
ways that make them a most delicious
dish. At a recent luncheon the hostess
surprised her guests by serving a dish of
mussels in silver shells cooked' after a
recipe that gave them' much the flavor -of
snails prepared in the French style,

and the shells well scraped and' washed

made of vegetables containing this vast

FROM Texas comes this strange ac

War, and for several years there
after, Mns. Rachel Moores, with her hus
band. Colonel David II. Moores. resided
Â«-in her beautiful country plantation near
Alamo Mills, Tex., about twenty miles
fcouth of Tcxarkar.a. They had been large
Flaveholders and In the early part of 1SC&
had many of their former slaves living on
the place witl- them. About that time sev
eral robberies by ex-slaves of their
former masters m-ere reported In this sec
tion, the news 'of which occurrences led
to a consultation between Colonel Moores
and his wife as to the proper action neces
f&ry for the safety of their own property.

quently appears, moving over the prarie,
a light as large as the headlight of an

still other times it assumed very much
larger proportions.
No one has been. able to exactly locate
It, as it disappears before the investiga

At least two men who lived there in an

One was Gable Post.
He came to town and left without say- .

he would ask if the settlers in his section'
were still holding their claims.
The other man waa Dennis Connlhan.
In hi9 letters he frequently speaks of a>
strange section, and asks if the settlers
are there yet. .
They lived alone and, were superstitious.
It Is believed they saw the strange light
and left on account of it.
A local newspaper"gathered these facts
regarding the mysterious light:
' : A few nights ago a number of persons
1 were confident they saw a burning build

to locate anything of that nature in that
neighborhood. v
: Those ; who â¢ have been investlgatlris the

TJk. TT EAR Muncle, Ind., a phantom dog
P^ , has been reported recently.
XL li Unlike the ghost of Podunk road,
this spirit visitor can not be seen,
but Is heard barking night after night.
The phantom dog is paid to frequent the
road between Yorktown and Dale vllle. Its
barking will be heard close to pedestrians,
wheelmen or vehicles, but, upon Investi
gation, no dosr can be found.
Several bra vÂ« young men have endeav
ored to catch sight of the uncanny animal
that is heard but is never visible, but all
to no purpose.
People who believe In' ghosts predict
somo dire catastrophe for travelers in this
section, while others declared it is nothing
but a hitherto unnoticed echo. : ' But no
dog about this portion ef the country has
the shrill, terrified ' and terrifying note ;
that the phantom canine gives vent to.=-*
Another "" theory is ; that the dog itself

ago, and the dog. is' supposed by somo
people to be his.

home of J. H. Smith of Findlay,
Ohio. The family. was awakened at mid
night by the sound of music in the house,
and were horrified to find that a large
music box in the parlor was grinding mer
rily* a way without any signs' of having
been tampered with by . human hands. A'
side door leading to tne street was open,
but as nothing in the house with the pos
sible exception of the music box had been
touched the idea of burglars seems almost
preposterous. The occurrence was decid
edly uncanny, to say the least.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith retired as usual
after locking the house securely. Major,
an immense St. Bernard dog, was in the
house, as usual, and no' thought of un
welcome guests was for a moment enter
tained. They had been asleep some time
when Mrs. Smith was awakened by tha
barking of the dog. He soon desisted,
however, and thinking It was nothing
more than eomo one passing on the out
side, Mrs. Smith dropped asleep. In about
an hour she again awakened and saw that
the door to. her bedroom, which had been
closed but not Jatched, was ; open. BhÂ«'.

but they decided It must have been caused
by the dog forcing his way into the room.
Suddenly Mrs. Smith was again awak
ened. She distinctly heard, the found of
music. " There . was a party across the
street, and she was inclined to think the
music issued from that source. A glance
at the clock showed her that It was near
ly 2 o'clock,' and that the party had been
over,; for some hours. The sound of the
music was remarkably plain.. She could
distinguish each note. It was the "Mock
lnar Bird." , . ,
"No one can appreciate the . wetrdness
of that music at that hour of the night,"
said Mrs. Smith. !'As soon as I was thor
oughly awake I realized - that It issued
from the music box in the parlor, directly
beneath my bedroom. I aroused Mr. Smith
and told him, my fears. He wouldn't be

The party Jerked open the door, and
there in the streak of light coming from a
lamp in the kitchen window stood a tall,
black Â£gure. Tne^nen rushed out to catch
It, but their hands closed on nothing but
air.
The spook had vanished!
A rapid search of the entire place waa

the mysterious visitor, who acted like a
ghost but did not resemble one. At least,
no one else has ever seen one than this
reporter, and he says it was not white nor
transparent, but black and â wonderful.
Wagons and carriages were pulled out
of their accustomed places, the tails of
the horses were Draided as before, the
cot?' tails were neatly tied up. and a calf,
which had been put into a grain bin In
order to facilitate Its weaning, was found
standing in the center of the floor.
The coats of the horses were thickly
coveTed with sweat, and the straw bed
.iing was ecattered all over the interior of
the barn. .
SITUATED a mile from Kast Brook
field, on the i ..dunk highway, Mas
sachusetts. Is the farm of Wilson T.
Houle, and it is here that a series
of events, mysterious ar.d even supernat
ural, have taken plare. which bring back
with startling vividness the days of witch
craft, and which, if they continue to oc
cur, will change many an incredulous
!Â«ufh to a startled gasp and cause many
a person to think twice before saying:
â¢ "There are no such things as ghosts."
The first indication that anything out of
the ordinary was going on was a splitting
shriek which broke out on the still night
*ir a. little more than a week ago. when
the Houle family were seated In the sit
ting-room of their house, which Is but a
stone's throw from the barn.
The bead of the family, who was read-
Irg at the table, sprang to his feet and
went to the window which commanded a
view of the barn. As he looked, he claims,
he caw a peculiar light coming from the
many cracks in the walls of the barn,
which, by the way, is a very ramshackle
affair, and he at once thought that the
barn waa on Cre and that the cry came
from one of the horses, frightened by the
flames ard imoke.
"Coxne. boys," he cried to his two sons.
"the barn Is on fire! Come and help me
itve the animals." And with that he
rushed out of the door in the direction of
the stable.
ThÂ« two boys followed with all possible
cpeefi, but even as they reached the barn
floor the phosphorescent gleam vanished,
a wild cry chilled them to the very mar
row, exid â all was once more still â stiller
thai was comfortable.
The trio stood for a moment as If spell
bound, and then the father advanoed to
the door and opened It.
Tae three horses were snorting in their
Â¦tails, perhaps alarmed at the late visita
tion, maybe frightened at what had taken
place; otherwise nothing out of the ordin
ary appeared to be present.
But when a lantern was lighted a start
ling discovery was made. Every horse's
tall was tightly braided, like a young
girl's hair.
Each person rook a horse's tail In hand
and It was but a very few moments that
the unaccustomed coiffure had assumed
Its natural appearance once more.
The next right a reporter for an East
ern paper appeared on the scene, and at 9
o'clock suggested that the elder Houle
and one of the boys accompany him to
the scene of the disturbance and try to
make the edifice "ghost proof." Accord
ingly hammers and nails were pressed
into service and in a very few moments
the doors and windows were nailed tight
with strips of board. The cellar door, for
there la a cellar under one part of the
barn, was the place chosen by the ghost
hunters for th*!r concealment, and so the
party crept into Its elected rendezvous.

fael off its feet Instead they have. In-
San Rafael is an ideal place for out-of
town residences. On the elevations, the
view of the rolling hills is both pleasing
and restful. Flowers grow luxuriantly
with the slightest encouragement, and
many are the other attractions. It can
not be laid at the door of the people that
they have'not made the most of the pos
sibilities, for wherever you turn you meet
a home that is artistic and commendable
in every detail.

finally the blinds are drawn the year

the real estate agent's hammer, and the
owner, now a confirmed suburbanite, ia

really surprising hov.' each year the list
of city deserters grows apace.
The show-place of all San Rafael, how*
ever, is the house and grounds belonjinj
to A. "W. Foster, the well-known railroad
man. The house la a large ramblin* oil

that wealthy people Insisted en bavin*

are flowers and trees In such profusion

the pretty little lodge at the grata* to th*
home up the winding road Is on* mas* of
blossoms and ths air Is sweet with, their
fragrance.
Certainly In all California, ther* 1b net a
town that can boast of mom arttitlo
homes than San Rafael These picture*

others besides that the camera did not

One of the prettiest of the new houses
In San Rafael Is that of Douglas Hardy.
Another beautiful home of recent 6aU
is that of Mrs. Ella Parks.
A pretty little cottage that prores that
taste can accomplish much without a
large financial outlay Is that of Mrs. H.

The home of Sidney Smith has always

has furnished his paper with a Ions let
ter which is published to-day, containing
details regarding the Russo-Chinese
agreement on the subject of Manchuria,
Mongolia and Turkestan. He says he is
absolutely certain that the published ver
sion of this agreement is in no way near
the actual truth. He then proceeds to
give the facts concerning the proposed
international administration of that part
of China, demonstrating that Manchuria
will become an integral part"of Russia
more so than even Bokhara.
Protectorate Is Established.
In regard to Mongolia he says there is
no doubt a protectorate has been estab

Russian flags everywhere, the thorough
organization of the district, the estab
lishment of tax collecting offices and the
opening of branches of Russo-Chlnese
banks, with no one but Russian officials
in charge. All this virtually has taken
place during the past six months, and be
gan before the Boxer outbreak. The

WHY COUNT TOLSTOI
IS EXCOMMUNICATED
Charges Preferred Against the Gifted
Writer by. the Greek
Church.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 9.â The offi
cial organ of the holy synod to-day pub
lishes the forrr.aK excommunication of
Count Tolstoi, the. Russian novelist anil
social reformer, which was announced
early in the year, as follows:
In its solicitude for the children of the ortho- I
dox church to guard them from being led into
corruption and in order to save those who have
gone astray, the Holy Synod has deliberated
upon the anti-Christian and anti-ecclesiastical
teachinpR of Count Leo Tolstoi and has deemed
It expedient, in order to .preserve the r-eaceot
the church, to l!>su>Â» R circular dealing: with the.
heresies of Count" Leo -Tolstoi.' -The circular is
as follows:
"Count Leo Tolstoi, to thÂ« irrief and horror
of the whole orthodox world, has. by speech
end writing;. . unceasingly striven to separate
himself from all communication with the ortho
dox church and this not only clandestinely but
openly end in the knowledge of all persons. All
attempts to dissuade him from this conduct
have proved without avail. Consequently the
orthodox church no longer considers him to be
one of its members and cannot regard him as
such ait Ions . as he does not repent and does
not become reconciled to the churrh. We there
fore ; place Â¦' on record " his apostacy from the
church and. pray the Lord to restore htm to a
comprehension of the truth. We pray thee,
therefore, .merciful God, who does not desire
the death of a. sinner, to hear us. have mercy
on him and restore to thy holy church. Amen.".

emissary came to him and asked him
what he would do if D'Orleans appeared
at Paris the following day.
"I would arrest him with my own
hands," said M. Deroulede.
Upon this hÂ« added that the Royalists
warned the Government, which changed
tho programme of the march past of the
troops in name of the Royalist party,
which was accused of connivance with the
police. M. Buffet protested. M. Derou
lede. with fury which revealed the weak
ness of his cause, replied that he was a
liar, and now these two are to fight a
duel. One is n Spain, and the other is in
Belgium. It Is said that they will meet
in Switzerland next week. It will be a
sensational duel.

Ehocld be formally delivered by the Brit
ish ErnbMsaxlor at Washington to Secre
tary Hay within a few days. The Foreign
OSice here did not originally contemplat-s
delaying tha British answer until now.
The plan appears to have been to transmit
the answer previous to the date on which
the treaty lapsed, which, according to the
22ritlsh view of thÂ© case, would have put
the onuh of Its lapsing on the Senate. As
previously eet forth In these dispatches,
the main object of the British Govern
ment throughout is to make an entirely
;.ew arrangement. At no stace of the
proceedings has there been any inclina
tion to accept the Senate amendments.
It is understood here that the nature of
the British Government's reply has al
ready been Informally communicated to
Secretary Hay. Great Britain has no in
tention of modifying the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty without a satisfactory quid pro
quo. That treaty, according to the
foreign Office view of the case, remains
as much in force now as the day it was
Flgned. The speeches made in the Senate
did not disturb Downing street. They are
dismissed with the remark that "treaties
cannot be abrogated Â¦without the consent
of both the contracting parties."
There is, however, an apparently gen
uine belief here that a satisfactory ar
rangement will eventually be arrived at.
There is a freely expressed disinclination
on the part of the British officials to com
mit themselves to any further treaties un
til they are thoroughly assured of the
vipwe tho Senate holds on the matter in
question.

SACRAMENTO. March 9.â Senate bill
102. appropriating $50,000 for a poly
technic school, at San Luis Oblspo,
became a law to-day without the signa
ture of the Governor. The bill was intro
duced in the Senate by Smith of Kern
and In the Assembly by John. It was
passed with comparatively small opposi
tion in either house. Its friends were
somewhat apprehensive of the gubernato
rial veto, and are feeling correspondingly
elated now that the bill has been allowed
to go Into force. The act takes effect
January 1, 1902. The board of trustees is
to be appointed within thirty days after
that date. *
structlons to the officials to punish Dear
by the straitjacket process. He did not
see Dear before he was given this pun
ishment. The Warden testified that the
prison physician was always on hand to
examine convicts before they were placed
in a straitjacket for punishment. Wilkin
son believed nine hours slight punishment
for a man like Dear. â¢
Dr. Nour.se, the prison physician, testi
fied that he examined Dear before he was
placed in the jacket and found him In
sound condition both physically and men
tally. /
Convict Hanna testified that the day be
fore Dear died Dear had told him that he
was going to die that night. Hanna as
serted that Dear was virtually "done up"
from the effects of . the straitjacket pun
ishment.

FOLSOM. March 9.â Cold in death.
Convict James Dear was found
yesterday morning upon the floor
of a comfortless cell in Folsom
prison. In one corner, close
to the cold wall, lay a pallet upon which
Dear had been placed the day before, suf
fering from the effects of prison disci
pline. The convict had been laced ,in a
straitjacket for nine hours, and It is al
leged that when he was released he was
almost dead. His agonizing groans had
resounded through the corridors.
To-day a Coroner's Jury, after Investi
gating the cause of Convict Dear's death,
returned a verdict to the effect that Dear
had come to his death by accident while
in . a helpless condition from punishment
received for infraction of prison rules.
Dear was a man of powerful build. He
was born in Illinois and was 30 years of
age. Since his arrival at the Folsom
prison he had given the officials much
trouble. He was stubborn, absolutely re
fused to obev the prison rules and would
not work. When in the prison only two
weeks he was punished for an infraction
of prison rules, but this did not subdue
him in the least, and when released he
started in to make more trouble.
On Tuesday Dear was put into the
Ftraitjacket and was kept there for nine
hours. Then he was taken out, given a
bath and removed to his cell, where he
remained until found dead yesterday
morning. Â¦Â¦"Â¦
Coroner McMullen of Sacramento ar
rived In Folsom this morning, impaneled
a jury and departed to the State prison,
where an inquest was^ield over the body
of the convict. -
Warden Wilkinson testified that Guard
Leuttrel had come to him and complained
of Convict Dear shirking in his work. This
was on Monday. The Warden gave ln-
"Convict James Dear came to
his death by accident while
in a helpless condition from,
punishment received for,in
fraction of prison rules." â

VANCOUVER, B. C, March 9.â United
States immigration officials have begun a
strict watch of the boundary line. In ten
days 125 Japanese have been captured anl
their naturalization and other papers con
fiscated.
Indigent Japanese, sick, without a cent
of money and altogether the worst class
of immigrants that could possibly go
through the States, have been crossing the
boundary line during the winter months al
most without hindrance. Their plan was to
pick up a living on Puget Sound until the
fishing season commenced and then return
to Canada and work under the entitlement
of their naturalization papers. Recently
the Canadian Government established a
customs officer at tho boundary line with
an inspector to work in conjunction with
the immigration officials. They have cap
tred on an average ten Japanese and Chi
nese a day trying to smuggle themselves
and their baggage across the line without
permits. This double offense against the
customs lawsSand the immigration laws
is considered sufficient by the authorities
to declare that all naturalization papers
held by such persons shall be confiscated
Most of these papers were Issued by
fraud.
The Japanese Consul has taken the mat
ter up and is telegraphing to Sir Wllfrlc"
Laurler at Ottawa to Interfere.
A new sensation developed- here to-day
in connection with the naturalization
rights of the 4000 Japanese who hold pa
pers in British Columbia." The full Court
of Appeal, composed of three Supreme
Court Justices, decided that every Japan
ese who has naturalization papers has a
right to vote and that nothing but the
British House of Commons can deprive
them of the right to exercise all the privi
leges of British citizeqs.
Officials Seize Many Japan

RENO, Nev., March 9.â The statements
of Dr. . Patterson, superintendent of the
Hospital for Mental Diseases, who ap
peared before the Assembly recently,
have aroused much comment. In pleading
for an amendment to the law relating to
the committing of Insane persons to the
asylum he said that there were twenty or
more sane persons at the asylum who had
been sent from various counties to save
the expense of maintaining them at the
poorhouse. They were generally commit
ted by the County Clerk in the absence
of the District Judge, and when they
reached the asylum were according to the
commitment papers, "violently Insane."
Sometimes they were merely getting over
a long spree and when sobered up were
as rational as any one.
The doctor cited a case where the Sheriff
brought In a patient committed as insane
who was merely drunk when he started,
and when he reached the asylum had so
bered, while tho Sheriff who brought him
In had become drunk and was the less ra
tional of the two. The doctor told the
patient he was not a subject for the asy
lum and advised him to go home at his
own expense. He agreed to do so, and
went to Reno, and borrowing money from
George Turrittln returned to his home in
a perfectly sane condition. The Sheriff so
bered up and followed him the next day.
The doctor wanted the law so amended
as to allow no persons to be committed to
the asylum unless they were examined by
competent physicians and in the presence
of a Judge of the District Court, the com
mitment papers to come from him. It Is
evident that such a law Is badly needed.

probability the first train over the South
ern Pacific's new coast division on the
schedule to go into effect soon will be the
famous rolling palaces of the Webb-Van
derbilt party. The train is now here
awaiting the party's bidding. It has been
announced that on leaving here the East
erners will go direct to San Francisco
over the coast division, and that it Is the
Intention of Dr. Webb to continue the
Journey to New York over the Central
and Union Pacific routes, the Rock Island
line and the Vanderbilt lines east. It will
be a record-breaking trip, as no avoidable
stops will be made. The purpose of Dr.
Webb and other members of the Webb-
Harriman syndicate In visiting Santa

one of pleasure; the 6hrewd business
minds of these men have been steadily
at work on gigantic schemes of transpor
tation. By this long distance trip with

make a great experiment in fast time, and
the world will be startled a short time
hence when a)' breath-taking schedule is
adopted over the combined Vanderbilt
lines spanning the continent.

been enjoying itself greatly. The first
move of the visitors was the purchase of
a number of blooded horses, some of them
from the stables of the late Baroness
Josephine Hamsch, who committed suicide
at her beautiful Monteclto country seat
recently. Dr. Webb has consented to be
come a member of the Country Club and
has arranged to spend next winter here.
It is rumored that he has purchased some
real estate, with the Intention of erecting
a mansion, to be occupied by himself and
friends as a winter home for the future.
The latest pleasure excursion which the
party has arranged Is a relay tallyho
ridÂ© to the Underbill rancho, near Los
Alamos. The distance Is about seventy
miles and will be covered In five relays
from Santa Barbara. During the stay
there the party will be the puests of the
owner of the ranch. F. T. Underhlll, an
Intimate friend of Vice President Theo
dore Roosevelt. Since their etay here the
visitors have been the guests of Mr. Un
derhlll on several occasions and have en-
Joyed a number of Jaunts in the moun
tains under "his guidance. After a stop
of several days at the Underhlll ranch,
the party will meet Us train at Lompoc,
to continue the Journey to San Francisco.
Will Be the First to Bun From Santa

Word was received from Ogden during
that day that a registered package was
received at the postofflce there yesterday
addressed to Harry Westwood Cooper.
The notice was delivered at "the station.
The package Is said to be from C T.

Mr. Humphreys had left for Calaveras
County yesterday morning. His wife ex

late hour had not received any: Captain
Seymour was also apprised of the matter
and telegraphed the Chief of Police of Og

return it here.

He was promptly removed from the court
to the City Prison.
Before goln? to the court Cooper sent
for a messenger boy and dispatched him
on an errand. The boy returned with a
bouquet of violets and $2 50 cash. with,
which Cooper ordered a sumptuous re
past to be brought to him from a near-by
restaurant. He wanted people to believe
that his young wife had sent the bouquet
and money, so as to create the Impression,
that she wa$ still in love with him, but
when taxed with it by Captain Seymour
he confessed that he was prevaricating.
In the afternoon he sent word to Cap
tain Seymour that he would like to have
a talk with him. and the captain had him
brought to his room from the prison. They
were closeted together for over an hour,
and after Cooper had toeen taken back to
the prison the captain said Cooper wanted
to dictate terms to him as to the cases
against him, but he was Informed that
they would be prosecuted to tho bitter

NOT FORGIVING
PHOENIX, Ariz., March 9.â An exciting
pcene took place In the lower house of the
Territorial Legislature to-day, during
which Senator Barkel^y, a member from
Pima County, received a pair of black
eyes at the hands of W. J. Morgan, mem
ber from Navajo County. The men are
both Democrats and during the legislative
session have been frequently aligned on
opposite sides of questions at issue. Mor
gan is quiet and usually humorous,
though easjly offended. -
During the morning hour Barkeley made
a remark inferring that Morgan wanted
to say something but dared not do so.
I>ater, in committee rooms, Morgan told
Barkeley he could take care of himself.
During the afternoon, while a bill was
under discussion, Barkeley walked over
to Morgan's side of the house and en
gaged in conversation. No one noticed
them till Morgan landed a blow on Barke
ley's face and followed his assault with a
second blow, that staggered his opponent.
Instantly the sergeant-at-arms was or
dered to arrest Morgan, and later Barke
ley. Morgan refused to make a statement
and told the House that Barkeley had
said something to him that no man would
stand. Bloodshed Is feared.

The object of the change at this time,
Knight repeated, was that he wanted to
give Ryan a place, and the change had
not been made earlier because Peterson
had hurt his foot. He said he himself
never talked to Peterson on the subiect.
and the first thing said to Peterson about
Riving up his place was the conversation
Brown had with him a week ago.
Brown. Knight says, is a man he has
known for a long time, mainly in a poli
tical way. Brown- helped in his cam
paign and did good work. The story
that he wanted to draw the salaries of
the two clerks, .he said, was not true
The only thing that was. told to. Peterson
was that he must divide up with the man
named Ryan. â¢ .
Regarding Ryan Mr. Knight would say
but little. Ryan was a friend, he said, but
he had done no politics for Knight during
the campaign and Knight said he did not
know where he lived beyond the fact that
he was a resident of the city. Ryan ia
not up here now, but Knight said he
would be up, probably Monday, to take

"I have not known Peterson long. He
came to me first to ask me to let him
do some printing for me and then he
started to canvass for me. I did not know
him then, but up here I was told I would
have trouble with him."
"About a week ago I told Brown
to talk to him about Ryan. I
thinkâ I have no doubtâ Brown tola
him he had to make some arrange
ments with Ryan whereby his pay
could be split up between them and he
could go down to the city. I told Brown
something of that kind had to be done. I
â¢wanted to give the other man a chance,

not come to any agreement, I had the
resolution put in.

put him on aa a porter, but he would not
take the place, bo I pot him appointed bill
filer. It was the understanding that he
was not to hold on the whole session.
ASSEMBLYMAN KNIGHT OF
THE THIRTY-FOURTH LEGIS
LATIVE DISTRICT.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO. March 9.â In the As
sembly this mornins r>uryea pre
.sented. a resolution removing C.
: .J, Peterson from his position as
bill flier and substituting Henry Ryan in
his place. Now the deposed bill flier Is
making, things'/ warm for till concerned,
and in the scandal he has raised ho in
cludes E. D. Knight, Assemblyman from
the -Thirty-fourth District in San Fran
cisco, and "W. A.' Brown, clerk of the
Committee on Federal Relations, of which
Knight ia chairman.
Both Brown and. Peterson were Knight's
appointees. Brown to a $5 place and Pe
terson to a $3 place; and Peterson declares
that the -proposition to step aside and al
low Knight to draw the pay of both was
made to him by Brown.
Last Tuesday, Peterson says. Brown
came to him an.d told him that, as
Knight's pay would stop on Thursday,
the sixteenth day of the session, it would
be but fair that they should both let go
up here and return to the city, leaving
Knight to. draw their pay until adjourn
ment. It could easily be done. Brown
said, because there was-nothlng for them
to do, anyway, . and no one would miss
them.
Peterson says that he would have noth
ing to do with the proposition. He told
Brown he had worked hard for Knight
during the campaign, making a house-to
house canvass for him, and he deserved
the place and was not going to give it up.
Warned He Hust Acquiesce.
The matter rested until Thursday, when
Brown made an appointment to meet him
in front of the Golden Eagle Hotel.' When
they met, Peterson says. Brown put the
proposition to him again, and again he
declined. Then Brown told him he had
better agree, because If he did not Knight
would drop him from the payroll any
way. To this Peterson replied that he
had a family to support. If he were
dropped he could not help It, but he was
not going to get off the payroll in such
way as was proposed.
This morning Duryea submitted the res
olution In the Assembly. As he did so
Speaker Pendleton questioned the regular
ity of it, and Duryea said he put the
resolution In by request, and while he
had no personal knowledge of the matter
hfi understood it was satisfactory to every
one concerned.
Knight then arose and said that Peter
son was -his appointee and he was satis
fied with the resolution, so it was put
through, and Ryan was put in Peterson's
placeâ or will be next Monday.
In explaining : his connection with the
matter to-night Knight said:
"It was understood when I appointed
Peterson that he was not to hold on dur
ing :tho entire session. He did hold on
longer than I expected, and so I had him
removed and put Ryan in his place. Ryan
is a .friend of mine."
Knight as a Philanthropist.
Knight sa<d it was at first not his de
sire nor intention to appoint Peterson to
any position, but Peterson came to Sacra
mento and he felt he had to do some
thing for him. He expected him to hold
on during part of the session and then to
give war to some one else, but some
weeks ago Peterson hurt his foot, and
Knight said he let him hang on longer
than at first he intended.
"Peterson's desire was not' so much a
position on the pay roll," continued
Knight, "as an excuse to be in Sacra
! mento. He wanted- to .meet people who
| would help him secure a place with, the
Harbor Commission and. to be able to sqs
the Governor, who, he said, had prom
ised that he^ehoold have, a job. I told
;h!m*I could not do much for him, for I
did not believe I would have' the patron

anything -would do so long as he could

CATARRH 0F_THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef-
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has Ions been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The .usual symptoms are a full or bloating
sensation after eating, accompanied some-
times with sour or watery risings, a for-
mation of gases, causing pressure on the
heart and lungs and difficult breathing,"
headaches, fickle appetite, nervousness
and a general played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the mouth,
coated tonsue and if the interior of the
â¢stomach could be seen it would show a
slimy, inflamed condition. : .
The cure for this common and obstinate
tiouble is found in a treatment which
causes the -food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment and
irritate the delicate. mucous surfaces of
the stomach. To secure a prompt and
healthy . digestion is the />ne necessary
thing to do and when normal digestion is
secured, the catarrhal condition will have
disappeared. ; .
, According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
Â¦meal Â¦ a tablet, composed of Diastase,
Aseptic Pepsin, a. little Nux, Golden Seal
and fruit acids. These tablets can now
be found at all, drug stores under, the
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and
not being a patent medicine, can be used
with 1 perfect safety and .assurance that
healthy appetite and thorough , digestion
wP follow their regular use after meals.
Mr. N. J. Bobher, Chicago, 111... writes:
"Catarrh is a local condition resulting
from a neglected cold In the head, where-
by the lining membrane of the no.se be-
comes 'inflamed and the poisonous dis-
charge therefrom . passing 'backward Into
the throat reaches the stomach, thus pro-
ducing catarrh of! the stomach. Medical
authorities prescribed- for me for three
years' for catarrh of stomach without
cure; but to-day I am the happiest of men
after;; using only one' box of Stuart's

the headquarters, of the Department of
the Lak^e express the opinion that last

the profits went to buy delicacies for the
men's tables. Now the men spend more

I :,.v^.*Â«*aWÂ«&;Â«Â«* â CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST-AMERICA'S GRANDEST STORE VS.^OÂ«^on^c^^^^.: U :.:V^ |The Delaware Legislature has closed with a â¢ bang, leaving; the : State without a representa
tive in 'the. Senate and;Mr.,Addicks:in thetposition of a^dos:, in the /man per ' â¢ :
Eastern society notes announce that the popular game of the smart set this summer is to be
"squash tennis," which is described as an American" form of the old- English game of racquet, and a
half-brother to handball.. It: is said to be already in high favor in New York and Philadelphia,
and is expected to rule the roost at Newport. ':[ ,.. \] ; ; :
THERE is some rejoicing in the country because Senator Carter talked the river and harbor
bill to death. The garlands that' adorn Carter are contributed by those who oppose the bill
and the immense appropriation which it carries.; But these people have more -bouquets than
logic. Senator Carter did not lay. the bill in a grave dug by oratory because it appropriated too
much money, but because it did -not appropriate more. His project for expenditure of Federal
funds was not in the bin,1 therefore he slew it, and it died and is dead. There died with it all the
appropriations for Pacific Coast harbors, most, of them, sorely needed, and for rivers which serve
to regulate transportation* for a large majority of our Western people. Senator Carter wanted
several millions f or irrigatibjn, with; several millions ; multiplied in future bills.
As far as concerns irrigation, the arid West, is deliberately destroying a resource that could
accomplish niore than direct appropriations. If the stock ranges, which are now being destroyed,
were leased and preserved, their rental would' immediately produce ten millions a year, and that is
more than Senator Carter will get per year in the river and harbor bill during this century and
the next. That money devoted to irrigation in the States and Territories where, it is derived will
start irrigation and keep it going \vithout appealing to the- Federal treasury for a dollar.
Such a policy would save; our river and harbor improvements. It would save the stock
ranges and it .would also' economize Senator Carter's r c6stly breath'. SISSS
THE RIVER AND HARBOR BILL.
It is to be hoped the notices sent out will have the effect of so stimulating shipments
of exhibits as to enable. those in charge to have California's exhibit in place and in good order on
the opening day. It is safe to say that many States and many private exhibitors will be unpre
pared on that day, and consequently we can make a strong and deep impression at the i tart
by being ready at the word go. ...
The opening of the fair coincides with the inauguration by the transcontinental railroads
of a policy of promoting the immigration of home-seekers to the Pacific Coast. Cheap rates, are
to be given to such excursionists from the East to California. That in itself will be an inducement
for many persons to visit the State, and if to it be added a comprehensive and well-displayed ex
hibit of California products at Buffalo, the number of people and the amount of capital attracted
to the State during the summer and the fall ought to be very large.
It can hardly be necessary at this, late day to remind the people of California of the
importance of the enterprise. Reports from the East are to the effect that the exposition will be
not so much for spectacular display* and public education and entertainment as for the purpose of
promoting business. While the aim of the enterprise is primarily to augment trade between
the various countries of this hemisphere, it is recognized that a great deal will be done to increase
trade between the' States of the. Union. Our great market is the home market, and. whatever we
have that is likely to find customers within the United States ought to be among our exhibit-;.
PUBLIC attention has been already directed by The Call to the fact that notice has Leen
sent out that all California exhibits intended for display at the Pan-American Exposi
tion at Buffalo must be at the ferry building in this city by next Friday. The exposition is
to be opened on May r, and as it is desirable that the California exhibit shall be complete in every
respect on the opening day, there is no time to spare.
THE BUFFALO EXPOSITION.
The only character of human Interest in
the play is Selysette. In the last act, be
lieving that she has lost her husband's
love, she determines to die and throws
herself from a tower. She tries to make
Aglavaine and Meleahder believe that her
Other adjuncts, stock-in-trade of the
Maeterlinck drama, are â¢ not wanting
Something deformed or uncanny must cf
course be there and this we find in the
shape of a paralyzed old woman (Mell
grane); the usua"l "enfant terrible" ap
pears in Little Yssaline. The hero (Mele
ander) has a tolerable opinion of himself
and a wordy admiration for the beauty
of holiness and the holiness of beauty;
he is supposed to be (dramatically) cap
able of inspiring with deathless devotion
two good and beautiful women: yet, .upon
inspection, he turns out to be little more
than an inmate escaped from some neigh
boring Malson d'Allenes. For proofâ aÂ«
the husband of Selysette he Is dutifully
in love with her. but at the same time he
is In love with Aglavalne. Now. if for the
sake of argument, we stretch a term and
allow with Balzac that a man can actual
ly be in love wit\ ;-vo women at once, we
must certainly contend, as did he and
Captain Macheath, that the sight of one
dear charmer will drive away thought of
the other. Could any fact In human na
ture be clearer than that?
But M. Maeterlinck will not have it so;
he makes Meleander say to Selysette
(act III, scene 1): "When I am near you
my thoughts are of her, and when I am
by her side it i3 of you that I think" (!).
Did Selysette resent this? No. Did
Aglavaine? No. They both took it as a*
compliment. â¢ * * Such beings exist
Â¦ not in the heavens nor in the earth of
which we have ken; they exist only in the
diseased imagination of a decadent
whose system Is poisoned with the mala
ria of Belgian canals and French sym
bolism.
Ah, he Is a rare fellow, this Meleander!
Behold him in the second act:
MELEAXDER.
(Taking her in his arms)â You are beautiful. !
Aglavalne.
AGLAVAIXE.
(Throwing her arms around him)â I love you,
Meleander!
MELEANDER.
Is it you who arÂ« cryinr. Aglavalne?
AGLAVAINE.
No, it is we, Meleander.
MELEANDER.
And la it we who are trembling ?
AGLAVAINE.
Tes.
(They kisÂ« each other. A cry : of pain Is
heard through the foliage and Selysette Is
seen, all disheveled, flying toward the castle.)
Imagine the mentality of a man who
doesn't know whether he or the lady or
both are crying, and observe the cheap
old device of the Overheard Conversations
to bring about the complication. â¢ â¢ â¢
But let us proceed. Meleander follows
his wife and thus squares himself with
her (act IIU:
MELEANDER.
Oh, my beautiful Selysette! Were an ansel
from heaven to float into my arms. Into the
plac? that, is yours, I could not lay bare ray
soul more profoundly than 1 do to you. Whether
she (Aglavalnr) po or stay, the will have shown
mÂ» where your beauty lies: she will have taught
me to love "you at last as I never yet have
loved. Our love lifs far above ourselves. Sely
fette; there where we loved each other we are
pure arc! beautiful, and there, too. do we meet
you. and fcr seme time now, thanks to you, we
have no longrer had to leve you without seeing
vou Come, give me your lips. I kiss you on
your foul to-night. Selysette. Come, midnight
Is rtrlkins. Let us go and Fee whether Ajtla
vaine's dream be still weeping thrcuch her
sleep.
The psychology of this passage Is as
muddy as Its phraseology. How. for ln
stame. can Mellander be passionately in
love with Aglavalne and at the same time
be taught by her rapturously to love
Selysette? What do these phrases' mean:
"There where we love each other we are
pure and- beautiful": "I kiss you on your
soul": "Our love lies far above our
selves"? Can real men and women talk
this way and escape' the Commissioners
of Lunacy? Nowhere, let us hope, except,
perhaps. In Belgium.
This, it seems to me. is really the
banner figure of decadentism: "Hair that
can smile or weep, be full of life and be
tray beauty." is an image whose glory
makes pale by comparison those famous
lines of Dryden's on Lord Hastings
smallpox, which have . heretofore been
generally received as the standard for
this style of writing:
Blisters with pride swelled, which through his
flesh did rprout
Like rosebuds, stuck In the Illy skin about.
Each* little pimple had a tear In it
To wall the fault its rislne did commit:
Which, rebel-like, with its own lord at strife.
Thus # made an insurrection 'gainst hl9 life.
Or were thei>e Kerns sent to adorn his skin,
The cabinet of a richer soul within?

TO MEASURE HAY-Nevada, City.
'Any rule for ascertaining' the quantity of
hay in a stack or mow by measurement
is necessarily approximate only. In
large Flacks that have been standfbg long
enough to settle well 224 cubic feet make
a ton. This is a mass 4x9x9 feet. In a
email, low stack or Email loft it takes 403
cubic feet to make a ton. This is a pile
Ex0x3 feet in elze. In a wagpii. unpressed,
W0 cubic feet or a load Gx9xl0 feet poes
lor a. ton. Of newly cured hay. freshly
loaded or stacked, 70o cubic feet or 5x10x10
feet is. estimated to make a ton after it
has dried out. The Government standard
for hay in the Ftack Is 422 cubic feet to
the ton. This is a pile (1x7x10, with two
cubic f,eet added.'
A common rule to weigh hay in the
stack Is to measure the length and
breadth of the stack, take the height from
the ground to the eaves; add to this last
one-half of the height from the eaves to
the top; multiply length by breadth and
the product by the height; all expressed
in feet; divide the amount by 27 to lind
the cubic yards, which multiply by the
number of pounds supposed to be in a
cubic yard, 132 avoirdupois for new hay
and 154 for old hay.
Still another rule Is to allow 512 feet
(cubic) to a ton.
MOUNT HERCULES.-Some time ago
there was published In answer to a ques
tion, upon the authority ot Captain J. A.
Lawson. a statement to the effect that
Mount Hercules in New Guinea was 32,780
feet high. Another correspondent, R. O.
S.. of Palo Alto, who look exception to
the statement of Captain Lawson, has
made a search on nls own account with
the following result: "Regarding Mount
Hercules, named as the hl&hest mountain
in the world," writes the correspondent,
"Benjamin E. Smith, editor of the Cen
tury Atlas, writes: 'The statement with
regard to Mount Hercules In New. Guinea
Is certainly an error. The highest point
on the island Is not far from 17,000 feet, ac
cording to the latest explorations.' George
C. Hurlburt. librarian of the American
Geographical Society New York, writes
â¢Captain J. A. LawsoiTis the sole author
ity for the existence of the mythical
Mount Hercules. Captain John Moresb"
R. N.. of H. M. S. Basilisk, was engaged'
in explorations and surveys of Xew
Guinea during the time assigned by Cap
tain Lawton to his own adventures ar.d

It is good to know that the glory of the
Sembrich Opera Company is not depend
ent solely upon the magnitude of the star
who gives her name to the organization,
but that in her supporting company of
singers some worthy names are to be i
found.
Chief of these is the barytone, Signor
Bensaude. who has carried off the musical t
honors among the men of the company. I
6i|nor Bensaude will be heard in one of i
his best roles, F:garo in "The Barber of Â¦
FevIIle," on the opening evening of the 'Â¦
season-
The Rosina of Sembrich is as well j
known to repute as the Calve Carmen, j
and, like it. is probably incomparable. ': ':'Â¦

An unusually musically cultured audi
ence was that which greeted the unique
programme cf the Musicians* Club con
cert the other evening at Sherman & Clay
lialL The programme must be taken as
typical of the kind of entertainment that
musicians indulge in for their private de
lectation, and was distinctly and grate
fully out of the ordinary run of pro
prammes: The rarely heard Mozart quin
tet, for clarionet, two violins, viola and
'cello, played by Messrs. E. W. Kent,
Hother Wismer. Samuel Savannah. Con
rad Fuehrer and Arthur Weiss, came first,
and its limpi'3, easily-melodious phrases
and rich Arcadian grace were given to
admiration by the players. The addition
of the reed tone to the usual string quar
tet permits ot a surprising degree of va
rMy in the tone coloring. The quintet was
followed by a sympathetic rendering of
the quaint flute "Adagio" of Frederick the
Great, by August Rodemann, accompa
nied by Dr. EL J. Stewart. Mr. Rodemann
pnd Dr. Stewart were also heard in the
"Sonata for Flute, with Figured Bass."

hnrmonic Orchestra on an entirely new
basisâ a basis which has been found to
work successfully in Eastern cities and in
some cases in cities equal in size to San
Kranrfsco.
"The services of Mr. Rodemann have
been secured as director. This gentleman
was Mr. School's assistant in Philadelphia
and in San Francisco, and it hardly needs
to be added that he Is both musically and
executively competent. His intention is
to start in with a fixed nucleus of be

the basis of ability, from those who an

this nucleus he guarantees to produce a

successful under this system, even in the
face of excellent professionalÂ»organiza
tions, of which we have none in San Fran
cisco. Until the orchestra shall be self
supporting, dues of $1 per month will be
required until the orchestra is enlarged,
when dues will be correspondingly de
creased. Should It, however, be the wish
of the orchestra not to give concerts, it
would continue to exist on the pay basis
suggested above.

The country was informed that the' army : would' never disbandâ that it would be retained
as a permanent mercenary force to keep Lincoln in the Presidency for life. The Democrats more
'than played the return game with their enemy in mortuary and imperial politics. History was
marched around until she was footsore, and the Praetorian Guard, the Janizaries and the Mame
lukes, the Swiss Guards and the Hessians, were marched out in a longer procession than the Cru
saders made when they went against the Saracen.
But Liberty revived in time to be killed again by McKinley^ and the republic reappeared ap
parently on purpose to pass away again March 4, 1901.
It must be admitted that this ceaseless accusation had its effect on his own party. Murat
Halstead desired to have his brains knocked out, and Ben Wade and Henry Winter Davis, Sena
tors of the United States, fu.minated against him in their celebrated manifesto, which led to the
Cleveland convention and the nomination of Fremont as a Republican candidate for the Presi
dency, with the avowed [purpose of defeating Lincoln. ...
Having three times destroyed the republic and laid the pink toes of Liberty up to the daisies,
the Democrats got their fling in the Civil War. From the 15th of April, 1861, to the day of his
death Lincoln was accused ot the death of Liberty. AH kinds of testimony were offered against
him. Liberty was dead, and he was last seen going down the road in her company. The republic
had disappeared and who but he could have' abducted it? Every move that he made was looked
upon as the device of a suspect.
The country had a short breathing spell, and Liberty lifted up her renowned head until the
Mexican War, when she had another spell of dying, and the Whig politicians, including Abraham
Lincoln himself, not only despaired of the republic, but of a decent empire that would be taken into
good society. The political literature of that period reads like the lamentations of Jeremiah.
The death of Liberty in 1812, 183? and 1848 occurred under Democratic administration, and the
mourners went about the streets on the Federal and Whig platforms, and making dust their paper
with rainy eyes wrote sorrow on the bosom of the earth,- as Shakespeare said about trie pessimists
of his da v.
When Jackson was President there was no war, but he had been a soldier, had taken Jarge
responsibilities and been abused as are all men who have that initiative which is the final strength
of states. Liberty died again, poor lady, in his first administration and stayed dead through his
eight years. And she was very deceased, too, judging by the political literature of that day. ' She
died intestate, left no will, and the Whigs applied for control of the estate, just as the Public Ad
ministrator does for that of an intestate who puts off making a will until after the final interview
with the undertaker.
Jackson was pictured as an Emperor, Andrew I, enthroned as gorgeously as Shah Jehan,
and looking as savage as a meat-ax.
During and after the war of 1812 the same kind of critics wept around the deathbed of Lib
erty, and wore the badge of mourning for the time usually taken by politicians whose only stock in
trade consists in impugning the motives of those who are responsible for the government, and in
vaunting their own vestal intentions.
. It is not even" hinted that he felt the presence of the military necessary to protect him
against the outraged people whose freedom was taken from them, making bloodthirsty in
their desperation. We are willing to take these scared- critics into our confidence far enough to
whisper to them the reason why the thin-skinned militia officer acquired blisters, in the saddle and
the seasoned regular cursed his luck twice the length of Pennsylvania avenue. It was because the
inauguration is the great American show, and uniforms, especially militia uniforms, look well in a
spectacle. In all inaugurations for many years the military has been a prominent feature, and yet
the Goddess of Liberty on the dome of the Capitol glories under her, coat of verdigris and gazes
eastward whence cometh the sunrise, just as unruffled as when Jeff Davis had her hoisted up there
with an eagle roosting on her head;
SINCE the inauguration of President '.McKinley the Bryan press has seen visions â¢ and
dreamed dreams. It has published obituaries of the republic and indulged, in. epitaphy to
dead Liberty, all because of the presence of the army and navy in the inaugural proces
sion. It is alleged that the military feature not 'only dominated this, but exceeded any other in
auguration. No one has ventured to say that the President ordered all these armed men out, with
empty guns, for the purpose cf peppering Congress and the Supreme Court and declaring himself
dictator and sole branch of the government, but hardly more fuss could be made if he had.

pany will also post notices early next
.v/eek.
SCRAXTOX, Pa., March 9.â The Defa
ware and Hudson Coal Company to-day
ordered the posting of a notice at all thÂ»Â»
company's mines in the Lackawanna and
Wyoming valleys to the effect that tho
present rate of wages paid to all mine
employes will continue In force untl
April 1, 1902. At the office of General Su
perintendent Loomls of the Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western Company, it
was stated that a similar notice will be
Issued to-day, and Captain May, general
superintendent of the Hillside Coal an.l
Iron Company (the Erie Railroad's min
ing interests), eald that his, company will
follow the action taken by the others.
In only one instance thus far have tho
miners openly expressed disapproval of
the scale. The employes of the Mineral
Railroad and Mining Company, In tha
Shamokln region, say they want a 6 per
cent advance to- place them on the same
basis as the Reading miners.
PHILADELPHIA, March 9.âAnticipat
ing the convention of the United Mine
Workers of America at Hazleton, . Pa.,
next week, coal operators throughout tho
anthracite region to-day posted notices
announcing that the 10 per cent advance
In wages and other concessions made to
the miners last November would be con
tinued until April 1, 1902, and that local
differences would be adjusted with the
employes of the respective collieries. This
action, it is understood, was determined
on a week ago and is said to have been
the result of an effort on the part of the
operators to avoid a conference with the
miners or any recognition of the union.
Notices have been posted at all mints
operated by nine of the leading coal min
ing and coal carrying companies. While
the officials of the big companies are reti
cent, it is understood that they will posi
tively decline to take part In the mineis*
convention. The request made by Presi
dent Mitchell of the Mine Workers' Union
that the operators send representatives
to the convention has thus far been for
the most part ignored. In one or two
cases a negative reply was sent. Tho
operators have, however, expressed their
willingness to treat with their own em
ployes when there are any grievances to
be adjusted.
More Concessions ArÂ« Made
Through Fear of Com
ing Convention.

After the transaction of brief routine
business the resolution offered yesterday
by Hoar that a committee of two Senators
be appointed to wait upon the President of
the United States and notify him that un
less he might have some further business
to transact the Senate was ready to ad
journ without day. was laid before the
Senate and adopted. The Vice President
appointed Senators Hoar and Cockrell as
the committee. On 'motion of Hale the
Senate then, at 12:23. went Into executive
session. At 1:52 p. m. the Senate opened
its doors for the final proceedings of the
extraordinary session. They were exceed
ingly brief. The committee appointed to
wait upon the President reported through
Hear that the duty had been discharged.
The President had Informed the commit
tee' that he had no' further business for
the Senate to transact. *
Allison then moved, at 1:55 p. m., that
the Senate adjourn without day. Amid
handclapplnj? the Vice President declared
the motion carried and his gavel fell, this
ending the session.
After the request had been granted
Â¦without comment. Hoar, addressing the
chair. remarKed that for obvious reasons
no objections were made to the request
of Morgan, but be felt bound to say that
it was likely to give rise to great incon
venience on both sides of the chamber. If
any further requests of such a nature
were made by Individual Senators, he
said, he would feel bound to object.
Morgan, chairman of the CImmittee on
Interoreanic Canals, asked unanimous
consent that Mitchell be appointed to suc
ceed his predecessor. McBride, as a mem
ber of that committee. He realized, he
eald. that it was an unusual request, but
It was made because of the notable inter
est in canal legislation always manifested
by Mitchell, who, like McBride, was an
earnest and able advocate of the construc
tion of the canal.
During the session practically no busi
ness except that of an executive
character was transacted. The ses
sion was , called by the President
In order that the Senate might
have opportunity to confirm appointments
made at the beginning of the session.
This business accomplished, there was
nothing further for the Senate to do.
At the opening of to-day's session the
President pro tern. Senator Frye of
Maine, was inducted into office, the oath
being administered by Vice President
Roosevelt. John D. Mitchell, the recently
elected Senator from Oregon, was pre
sented by his colleague. Senator Simon,
and took the oath of office. He was given
a cordial reception by his colleagues on
the tloor, many of whom had served In the
Senate with him, and by his friends in
the galleries, who greeted his appearance
with hearty applause.
Several baskets of beautiful roses and
jonquils, arranged in deliberate designs,
adorned the desk of Senator Mitchell
when the Senate convened.
WASHINGTON, March 9.â After pro

statement: \
"If the winding up of the estate should
be left to the assignee for the benefit oS
creditors all the secured creditors would
participate in the remaining assets with
out any deducton on account of their se
curity. If, on the other hand, the estate
Is wound up under the bankruptcy act,
the secured creditors must first deduct
from their claims the value of the colla
teral before they are allowed to partici
pate in the distribution of the general
assets. This will make a very great dif
ference to the unsecured creditors, and
my clients are In that category."

The establishment of smelting centers
is a favorite theme just now in several
States. California miners are pointing
with pride to what is going on in Shasta
County, and there is an amount of jubila
tion in the utterances of the representa
tive mining journals in Utah and Oregon
on the outlook in those States. An ac
couiu of the recently installed plant at
Bully Hill is published by Mineral
Wealth. "There are larger, plants," says
Mineral Wealth, "but no better."
The people of Grants Pass, Or., are
speculating on the possibility of making
that place a smelting center. A writer
figures out that Grants Pass pays half
the entire taxes for Josephine County,
which indicates its monetary resources,
and this gives hope that the necessary
funds can t>e raised for smelters. A com
pany is proposed with $l,0oo,(XK> capital tor
the purpose of constructing a good roatl
to the Gallice mining district, for bridges
and for other preliminary purposes.
The Utah papers, especially the Mining
Review, are preaicting that the smelting
interests of Salt Lake City will surpass
those of Denver and Pueblo. There are
three smelting plants in' Salt Lake Val
ley which were absorbed bv the combine â
the Hanaeur, the Ucrmania and the Penn
sylvania. Uhe trust is now building a
$1,000,000 plant, which* when completed,
will treat ail ores purchased at home. In
addition to this plant the Highland Boy
plant and the Biiignam copper and Gold
Mining Company are in operation. The
United fctates plant will eventually han
dle its own ores, and a custom plant is
projected, the new State Smelting and j
Kefining Company being back of the en
terprise.
The dredging Interests are coming
steadily to tne front. A deal to which ai
i tention has previously been directed in
volves the purchase of 2000 acres about
flve miles below orovilie, on the west side
of the rivtr, and $70,(krj changed hands in
the transaction. The lanu includes in
part the well known LJiggs peacn or
chards. Prospecting drills were going
several months before the deal was finally
closed. Another dredger has been placed
on Trinity River, making three to be op
erated to date in Trinity County. The
dredgers are located respectively at Po
ker Bar, near Lowden's ranch, at Weaver
Basin and on the Trinity River on the
Boyce ranch, above Trinity Center.
The good luck of the miners of Califor
nia In the matter of abundant water this
season fs 'shared by the- miners of Ari
zona. There is an abundance of water in
the hills, so says the Mohave County
Miner, and there will be more prospectors
In the hills this spring than ever before.
In the Blue Ridge Range every canyon
has water, running, and the prospectors
will have easy work. In some parts of
the range this is the first time In years
that any water could be found, and there
fore it has been impossible for the pros
pectors to do much work heretofore.
The Angels Record reports that up to
the first of last mouth the rainfall in that
locality amounted to 16.50 inches and there
was a fall during the month of 8.61," mak
ing, a total to Marc'i 1 of 25.11, which is
nearly five Inches in excess of the record
to the corresponding date last year. â¢ Old
residents of Amador County say that the
water has not been so high: for years as
it has this season.

"A common mistake," Bays the Mining

mining scheme. Ordinarily when, a new
business is to be built up Investors rightly
recognize the injustice of expecting imme

be made and it is unjust and unbusiness
like to expect that it will begin "paying
dividends until after considerable outlay
and necessary development. More than
one good mine prospect has been spoiled
by the haste and Impatience of its co
owners, and no amount of ability or ex

"With twenty years of. refining behind tho oil
industry of the State, there ought â¢ to be no
one who would ask the question whether there
is any refined oil produced in California. At
the present time the refiners are paying from
$1 25 for 24-gravtty oil up to $1 40 for 32-gra.vlty,
and it is a well-known fact that the amount
of oil being refined In California for illuminat
ing purposes is steadily increasing.
The reflntng of illuminating oil haa passed
the experimental point, and the amount of
cil refined in California is only governed by
the amount of acceptable grades to bÂ« pro
duced. It la not claimed that the crude oil of
California Is so rich in illuminating properties
as that of the Pennsylvania fields, but much
of it is better than the Russian oil, and Russia
is to-day producing about one-half of all .the
illuminating oil used In the world.

A well will be drilled at Tomales, Maxln
County, In the hope of striking oil.
Tho Los Angeles HeraM thinks it is
suspicious that several papers have begun
to discuss the proposition as to whether
there is any illuminating- oil in Califor
nia's soil. Having In view the fact that
the Union Oil Company and the Pacific Oil
Company have had refineries in operation
for about twenty years and that for the
last. few years the Puente Company has
been operating a refinery and turning out
illuminating oil, as have the two other
companies named for a longer period,
there would seem to be room for the Her
ald to entertain suspicion. The Herald
states the case as. follows:
New Field Near Acton.
. The Los Angeles Herald carefully fig
ures out that the surplus production of
oil In the Los Angeles local field is about
15,000 barrels per month. The competition
of the Kern River district Is given as the
reason that there Is a surplus. With the
exception of 20,000 barrels per month, says
the Herald, all the oil used by the South
ern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads comes
from the Kern River fields. Production
in Los Angeles remains at 3000 to 3500 bar
rels per day. The use of oil fuel by manu
facturers in the Los Angeles field in
creases, but the Kern River field took
away customers. San Francisco as a
market has been captured by the Kern
River district and the hope of Los Angele3
that the shipping of oil by sea from there
to San Francisco would grow. to very
large proportions has not been realized.
The Herai- thinks that the present situa
tion is only temporary and urges com
bination on the part of the oil producers
to care for the surplus oil.
An oil company has been Incorporated
in Shasta County that has no stock for
sale. Ten business men of Redding are
the lncorporators. The capital stock
amounts to only 511,000 and there are 110
shares of $100 each. The company will be
known as the Phoenix Land and Oil Com
pany- The ten members of the organiza
tion will do whatever development woric
they think best and will also take all the
profits of their enterprise if it should
prove to be profitable. This i3 so unique
a corporation that it deserves some men
tion. The incorporators hÂ»ve secured a
tract of 2000 acres of patented land in
Stinking Canyon. The company is com
posed of the following named: A. w. Et
ter. D. M. Etter. II. R. Bemis. J. W.

J. Harrison Parker, assistant business
manager of the Chicago Times-Herald, is
out here on a short visit. Mr. Parker has
not visited the city for many years, but
it is more than a desire to revisit San

railroad man, to make him the happiest
of mortals, and during his stay here Mr.
Parker is enjoying the society of his

PYRAMID PILE CURE
Physicians Recommend It, Druggists
Sell It, Everybody Praisss It.
If we could sell one package of Pyramid
Pile Cure to every person in America who
Is troubled with piles and who would glad-
ly Rive the 50 ennts to be rid of piles, we
would have about ten million dollars. The
only reason that we> don't sell that many
packages this year is that we will not be
able to get ten million people to try it.
Just one application wih prove its merit
and amply repay the cost of a whole box.
The effect is Immediate. Comfort comes
at once, and continued treatment will
â¢cure any case, no matter how bad.
Pyramid Pile Cure soothes the inflamed
surface the instant It touches it, heals It,
reduces the swelling, and puts the parts
Into a healthy, active condition. There is
no substitute for It. Nothing compares
with it. ,Â¦ â¢ M
We have never heard of a single case
that It failed to cure; we have heard of
thousands that It has cured quickly and
completely.
Here are a couple of letters recently re-
From George C Geick, Owens Mill, Mo.:
"Some time ago I bought a package of
Pyramid Pile Cure for my wife, who had
suffered very much. The first trial did her
more good than anything she has ever
tried. Â» It is just what Is claimed for It."
From Richard Loan, Whlpple, Ohio:
"I have used the Pyramid Pile Cure and
am entirely pleased and satisfied with re-
sults. It does the work and no mistake."
The proprietors of the Pyramid Pile
Cure could publish columns of similar let-
ters but these are enough to show what
it will do in different cases.
All druggists sell Pyramid Pile Cure* or
will get it for you. It Is 50 cents per pack-
age, and made only by the Pyramid Drug

CONTAGION AND INFECTION.
La Grippe Is Infectious but Not Con-
tagious.
Contagious diseases arÂ« communicated
from one person to another; Infectious
diseases are conveyed through the air.
Smallpox Is a contagious disease: La
Grippe Is Infectious. When an epidemic of
the grip Is prevailing It 13 in the air wÂ»
breathe, and no one is safe.
The only' safeguard Is to keep the sys-
tem In the highest possible condition of
health, and on the first appearance of a
cold In the head to use some safe antisep-
tic like Stuart's Catarrh Tablets freely.
A tablet taken every hour or two for a
couple of days will be sufficient to break
up the attack.
La Grippe attacks the weakest part of
the system; It may be the lungs, heart,
liver, stomach or kidneys, but wherever It
finally locates It almost Invariably starts
w'th cold In the head and throat, or. In
other words, the disease at the beginning
is acute cartarrh.
This is the reason Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets have been so successful In break-
Ing ' up attacks of grip. The antiseptic
properties of the remedy destroy the
serms before the whole system is thor-
oughly infected.
Dr. Annlston says: Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets, being free from cocainw and
harmful. drups. Bhould be freely used at
this time of year on the first appearance
of Rrip symptoms.
They check the excessive catarrhal
secretions, stop the fever and prevent
pneumonia.
They are composed of antiseptics and
may be used by little children as freely as
by adults and with great benefit.
Dr. Lewlston says: My usual prescrip-
tion for the gTlp Is Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, which can be found at all drugstores.
Keep to the house for a day or two and
use the tablets freely, and I have never
heard any complaint of failure to cure.
The best opportunity yet offered in

TO ARRIVE
OWING to th^Ir own carelessness
two your.g rnen well known on
tho water front nearly lost their
lives by drowning la*t Friday.
Thpy b<-.rroweÂ«l a Tvhttoha.il and
FnilM over to G<~>at. Islard to catch a mesa
of fish for that cvming's meal. After fish
ing with fair success for a couple of hours
mi> of the fl^hTmpn lay down in the bot
tom of the boat and went to pleep. His
companion thought he could sail the.
Whitehall to San Francisco, but as soon
as Y-.e g-ot the sail Â«-et a. sudden squall cap
t'.ze<i the craft. Both men -were thrown
into the water, but manaped to get on
the bottom of ihe boat, and for an hour
â¢^i-*= r Â«i ewept to and fro by the eddies that
abound about Goat Island. Then the tug
Vigilant frcm the naval training station
cam* along: and took the men off. The
Whitehall was cast adrift, horrever, and
has probably pone out to pea.
The two young men were Richard Mc-
Donald, known to everybody on the front
&a '"Red Dick," and Gus Perata of 617
Front street. "Red Dick" is a good boat
man, but Guf Unows more about the mix
ing of cocktails than he does about hand
ling a. Whitehall. He is barkeeper for his
father, who keeps a saloon at 617 Front
Street. _=, ,
"Gus wanted to po fishing, paid Dick
v^fterday. "bo I promised to pet a boat
and take him o;:t. We intended to be pone
all day and took some refreshments alonp.
I sailed the whltf-hall over to the Island
and w-e soon caught Â»â¢ pood mess of fish.
I got tir*-d and lay down to have a sleep.
The next thing I knew I was choking in
the water. Gus had got tired of fishing
and wanting to go home, he had hauled
in the anchor and set sail. A squall
etruck the boat and Gus did uot know
what to do. so over she went.
"Well we managed to get on the bot
tom of the boat, and there we stuck for
over an hour. Once we drlfied in under
thÂ«Â» lighthouse, but wÂ» could not make
anybody hear. Then an eddy carried us
out Into the nay again and the current
sent uÂ» down toward the Oakland long
wharf. Juft when we had given up all
hope and were saying our prayers the
Vigilant came along and took us aboard.
I was nearly frozen to death and Gus was
more dead than alive. We soon came
around, however, but when we came to
look for oi:r wnitehall rhe was pone. The
crew of the tug said they could not make
fa*t to her and were compelled to pet her
adrift. We are out the boat and all our
tackle, and it will be a year before Gus

may of living combined with simplicity,
economy and tl:e highest utility, incurring
no restaurant *>r board bill, and returning
st the end of th*Â» summer with money in
my pocket, realizing that I had lived
sumptuously every day, for I had lived on
the tnoft perfect food known, and was
renewed in hÂ»^a!th. strength and mental
power end had acquired a complexion so
clear and fresh tinted that I was termed
Â¦ picture of health and felt myself to be
a happy woman."
"Many meals were made of delicious
Grape-Nuts alone. I experienced a pecu-
liar clearness of intellect and a bodily en-
duranre n^vor known before on the old-
time diet of meat, biscuits, butter, etc.
A little woman Â«rent to a certain Chau-
tauqua resort last summer and expe-
rienced a most economical and cheerful
way of livinc. Rhe was at that time in a
d^hllitated condition, with poor digestion,
which made it imperative that she have
the right kind cf food and yet such that
was nourishing nnd Ftrcngthening. "so I
took an r-rjuipm^nt of fresh, crisp Grape-

Grape-Nuts with a little cream or milk.

Mark EUingsen, Uie lookout man at the
life-saving station at Fort Po'at, was the
first witness examined by Aiajor Blake
ney yesterday morning. He was asked
whether he had or had not heard the
whistles- of distress sounded by the Rio,
and he replied that he heard no distrea?
signals whatever. He heard the usual fog
signals, but nothing more. Between 5 and
5:30 a. m. he heard a tug whistling tho
usual signal given In foggy weather when
towing a vessel through the fog. That
signal was one long and two short blasts
and was repeated between twelve and
twenty times.
The witness admitted that at the timÂ»
of the wreck he heard the noise of shout-
Ing on the bay, but he assumed that the
voices were those of Italian and GreeK
fishermen, who were often to be heard in
foggy weather.
V. A. Harrington, keeper of the Fort
Point Lighthouse, was recalled and testi
fied that during his watch, beginning at
not hear any voices coming" from-sea
ward. In very calm clear weather he had
often heard voices of fishermen in tho
bay, but he could not remember even one
occasion on which he had heard voice" "'
foggy weather. He was on the soutn
bastion and it was difficult to hear any
voices at that spot.
An adjournment was taken until 10
o'clock' to-morrow mornine, on which oc
casion It is expected that Major Blake
ney will inquire into the confession made
bv EUingsen to Captain Hodgson to the
effect that Ellingsen heard the distress
signals of the Rio, but for some unac
countable reason failed to report them.

Members of the- â¢Â¦ anti-Chartrey faction
have seen the letter of the matron, and at
the meeting to-day the charges will be

basement and obliged to use bath tubs In

The matron claims that four cf the nurses

ipera of his was very successful at the
time and his royalties from the "Trilby

travailed extensively and visited many
parts of the world.
When the years began to creep upon
him all bepan to fade away. He drifted

Springs. Then he became a wanderer
without home or frir-nds. Lust Joined the
Mario Ec-H Opera Company as conductor,
but things didn't go well with the com
pany, and when Clarksville. Tenn., was
reached the organization disbanded.
Without money the old composer was
thrown upon his own resources and tried
to earn a few dollars by teaching. His
life was so desolate thp.t even Ftrangers
noticed it and would speak a kind word
to the gray-haired musician. But there
was one vho brought cheer to his last
days. She was a b'-auliful Southern jrirl
and had seen but nineteen summers. She
was as sweet and unselfish as she was
beautiful.
Was His Favorite Pupil.
This girl was Lust's favorite pupil and
tried to throw a few rays of sunshine into
his lonely life. Sometimes when the les
sons were over she would pin a carnation
on his coat or send some little dainty to
his lonely studio. Often there were big
bunches of Southern roses. He would
place them on his piaro and play out his
soul to the sweet-scented beauties. Once
he pressed one of them in a book and
pinned it to a poem. The gray hairs were
growing thicker among the thin Iock3
and his health was falling. One morning
in the pretty Indian summer of the South
he went to her home to give a lesso'n as
Ufual. She saw that he was weak, and
didn't want him to teach that day. He
insisted. He needed the money and she
reluctantly yielded. That morning she
pang sweeter than ever, and there was
something especially tender in his music.
The effort was too much for him. Sud
denly his head began to reel, his eyes
dimmed and his voice failed. He clutched
at a chair and fell to the floor. He awoke
on the couch and felt the toijch of a pen
tie hand ur>on his brow.. HV seemed to
realize that the end was drawing near
and his eyes filled with tears as he gazed
upon the young girl. If a friend like the

After being separated for over twenty
two years, Frank and Charles Johnson,
brothers, met a few days ago under most
thrilling circumstances. Their recognition
of each other was romantic in the ex
treme and was almost accompanied by
bloodshed. Frank is now congratulating
himself that he is not occupying a cell in
the prison at San Diego, charged with
fratricide.
It happened this way. Frank, who Is a
mining man, had debarked from a steam
er at San Diego, â¢when he .was accosted
by several roughly clad fellows, who de
manded that he buy the drinks. . His re
fusal was met with a threat to send him
to the Morgue, and realizing that the

a revolver and, pointing it at the crowd,
announced his de.termlnatio'n to shoot the

"He won't: shoot," remarked one of the
fellowsâ a tall,, well-built man with a
blonde mustache. "Watch me take the
gun away from him." Â¦

None of the larger music publishers had
any knowledge of the dead composer and
none of his songs were for sale on their
shelves. A prominent firm of music deal
ers was inclined to think that Ferdinand
Lust had been mistaken for Ethelbert
Nevin. the composer, who died suddenly
last month, soon after writing the popu
lar song. "The Rosary." Lust's last song,
3?My Rosary," never obtained enough at
tention to be recalled by any one Identi
fied with music in San Francisco.
H. M. Boswick, one of the oldest musi
cians on the Pacific Coast, also failedt to
recall Lust as a factor in the local mu.it>

The dead composer lay at her feet. The
congregation v.as still and as the last

churches he had served as organist. Ft

beautiful, sunny-faced girl stepped to the
chancel rail and began the tender, sweet

company was made. The sooner the trial

Presiding Judge Dunne has assigned the
cases to Judge Hebbard for trial.

an option to purchase the mines at Gold

Syndicate bought them. Then they were

this latter, transfer. He was simply the
vendor in the first instance, selling h's

The second half of ihe first home-and
home tournament between teams of ladles
representing the Sail Francisco and Oak
land Coif clubs took place on the Presidio
links yesterday morning, beginning short
ly after 10 o'clock. Tho Oakland team was
captained by Mrs. P. E. Bowles and the
San Francisco eight by AIlss Caro Crock
ett. The San Francisco team was a much
stronger one than that which played on
the Oakland links a week ago, for it in
cluded Mrs. R. Oilman Brown. Miss Alice
C. Hoffman and Miss Alice Haecr, none
of whom played on March 2. Miss Hager
came up from Del Monte specially to take
part in the match and was a valuable
member of the team, winning 2 up from
Mrs. P. K. Bowles. Miss Mary Scott fell
an easy victim to Mrs. Le G. C Tibbetts,
losing 8 down, but Miss M. B. Houghton
more than equalized this score, winning
9 up from Mrs. \V. V. Johnson. The gen
eral result of yesterday's play was ex
ceedingly close, San Francisco winning
by the narrow margin of 1 up. Subtract
ing this from the overwhelming score of
44 up made on the Point Adams links on
March 2, the Oakland ladles win the first
match 43 up. The fair green was in splen
did condition yesterday and the putting
greens were fast. The visitors were en
tertained at luncheon in the clubhouse
after the match, and many of them
watched the men's tournament in the aft
ernoon. The. full results are given in the

iest. Eugene Geary's Ireland was hl3 op
ponent and the talent figured that the dog
with the green name could win in a walk.
Ten to 1 was the price, and a few pikers
paid it just because they looked upon it
as a good bet even if they lost. Ireland
showed that he was worthy of the confi
dence reposed in him and soon had a long
streak of daylight between him and his
opponent. The hare, though, had a say
and acted as though a good slzfd mutual
on the short-end dog had been slipped in
his boot before the course. Ireland turned
the jack right to the slower dog and the
result copt the form players a good slice.
Beacon stands first in the minds of those
who Dick stake winners well in advance,
and is he!d at 2Ms to 1 for the last flag.
\\odgewood did well enough against
Honey Boy to win favor in the eyes of
the talent and is second choice. Flood
gate and IJttle Sister have adherents who
fancy them for a good slice of the purse.
Lonneraara won his Jirst course. beat-
Ing Brass Button pointless. The old black
deg is liable to do a bit of running against
any of th* fast onos in this event and
prove a stumbling block in the way of the
top notchers. Brutus looks strong enougli
to reach woll along in the stake and then
have hard luck stories told of him.
Of the New Yoik dogs, Ideala. the only
winner, outworked Dewdrop for the deci
s.on, upsetting Calculation at the rate of
a to 1. The doga show some cleverness
but no great sptcd. . After a few stakes
they might perform to a better advantage.

TURF AND COURSING EVENTS AND FIELD DAY AT BERKELEY
FRESHMEN DEFEAT SOPHOMORES
IN ANNUAL FIELD DAY EVENTS
Close and Exciting Races on the Berkeley Cinder Path Are
' Enjoyed by a Large Gatheringâ Cheek and Cadogan
Carry Off the Honors by Their Brilliant Work
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, MARCH 10, 1901.
The crowd of spectators was not an en
thusiastic one. There was little feeling
shown by either class, and only at rare
Intervals did the collegians arouse from
their apathy to encourage their repre
sentatives to greater endeavors. The field
day practically was a tryout. A half
dozen promising sprinters and a few field
men give promise of developing Into
strong candidates for Intercollegiate hon
ors. Little Cadogan ran In great form,
and had he been pushed to his utmost
v.'ould have undoubtedly have broken the
coast record in two events. As It was, he
equaled the track record for 100 yards by
covering the distance In 10 1-5 seconds. In
the 220-yard dash he sped around the oval
and led his field by eipht yards. He did
the distance In 23 flat, but could have im
proved on this had he been pressed. If
Cadogan coi thiues to improve he will
surely equal Scroggln's time for the 100,
which was made on an Eastern track.
The two-mile run was Inaugurated.
There were more than a dozen starters,
but the distance was too great for the
bunch and only three finished. Clifford,
who won the race, finished strongly and
gives evidence* of being a good distance
man. With further training and better
pacing he ought to do better than he did
yesterday. His time for the two miles
was 11:28 -1-3, which Is comparatively slow.
Asblll did not shine in the 100-yard dash,
lie was beaten out by Brown and Town
send, two youths, who have- good speed
and endurance. Ealley won the mile run
In clever style. He allowed his field to .set
the pace until the last lap. when he let
out a few links and passed the runners
as if they were standing still. He spurted
the last 100 yards and finished fully fifty
yards ahead of his nearest competitor.
Bailoy has a fine stride and should bÂ«
heard from in the near future. Brown en
tered the 440-yard dash, but the effort was
too much for him. He fell exhausted. a
few feet from the tape and was beaten
out by Llgda. Cheek '04 did great work
for his class. He netted twenty points by
capturing the low and high hurdle events
and the broad and high jumps. He Is still
showing the great form he displayed
at Berkeley, by a score of 73 to 43.
This overwhelming victory Is evidence
that the baby class has better athletic
material than its rivals.

PRACTICAL VICTORY FOR
BISHOP MONTGOMERY
Santa Barbara Judge Decides the Suit
Brought by De la Cuesta Against
the Prelate.
SANTA BARBARA. March 9.â The long
drawn out case of Eduardo de la Cues-.a
vs. Bishop Montgomery was to-day de
cided in favor of plaintiff, but in such a
manner as to make it practically a vic
tory for the defense. In 1891 Eduardo de
la Cuesta of Santa Ynez became the man
ager of Mission Kanch at that place, then
under Bishop Mora. He continued as
manager for some time after Bishop
Montgomery took office in 1806. Trouble
arose between them in 1837, when De la
Cuest put in a bill for a balance due him.
including a certain amount as salary. The
Bishop claimed that De la Cuesta's ac
counts contained mistakes, errors and
frauds. De la Cuesta then sued for tho
payment of $3200.
The case was tried In the Superior Court
of this county last summer. During th^
trial It developed that plaintiff had kept
no accurate accounts and there had to be
an accounting on his part of some funds
which he had received from various
sources; so that in the court's opinion,
the amount sued for Is reduced from
$3200 to J73G IS.
On the original cause for action De la
Cuesta's alleged salary, the decision is In
favor of the Bishop.
GROVER CLEVELAND
IS CAUGHT IN STORM
Former President Narrowly Escapes
Drowning While Duck
Shooting.
NORFOLK, Va., March 9.â Advices re
ceived to-night from the Back Bay Club
house on this coast, where former Presi
dent Grover Cleveland Is shooting ducks,
state that he and the president of the
club, Joseph Seelinger, were In' danger of
drowning last night. | They were far out
In the bay and In good luck, having shot
seventy-five ducks and many geese and
pigeons. Cleveland refused to leave until
night fell. Then they Btarted for the
shore In their small boat. A storm arose
and the boat was nearly swamped. It was
8 o'clock and pitch dark before they got
ashore. Cleveland shot most of the game.
He sent sixty ducks through here to-night
to Mrs. Cleveland at Princeton. The club
members say that the former President
had a close call.
DUKE OF MANCHESTER
DECLARES IT BLACKMAIL
Eelieves Portia Knight Will Not
Press Her Suit for Breach, of
Â°-;'iiV" ; Promise.
NEW YORK. March 9.â A special to the
World from Liverpool says: The Duke
and Duchess of Manchester left Liverpool
to-day on the steamshiD Campania for
Queenstown, accompanying the Duke's
mother, who Is going to New York. Â¦
The young couple will spend some time
at their Irish residence at Tanderagee:
The World correspondent asked the Duke
if it was true that he had been sued for
breach of promise by Miss Portia Knight.
'"Yes," answered the Duke; "a writ was
served on me. but I look on It as being
in the nature of blackmail and have ig
nored it. The whole thing is preposterous.
I do not believe there is any real intention
to institute proceedinss. In fact, I under
stand they are already abandoned."
-Both. the Duke and the Duchess were In
high spirits.
GENERAL HARRISON v
SLIGHTLY IMPROVED
No Sign of Complication Has Been
Noted in the Condition of the
-Former President. . Â¦Â¦ -
-INDIANAPOLIS. -March 9.â The : condi
tion ofGencral Harrison. is slightly Im
proved. Friday 'night he slept well 'and
to-day he suffored less pain In the mus
cles 'ofihls chest; than' since i the attack of
intercostal neuralgia- began. : Dr. Jamie,
son called at *tho- residence. this morning
and found his distinguished patient rest
ing easily. The physician stated this
evening that immediate improvement
seemed In ' sight, although the advanced
age of General Harrison. was a factor to
be considered. ' No symptom of any. com
plication has yet arisen to alarm the
rather a ticklish subject, though," added
Butler, who is a married man.
"The Prytaneans," said Miss ' Adele
Lewis, president of that society, "were or

REPUBLICANS SLOW,
Â£..;Â¦/ SAYS WILLIAM J. BRYAN
Greater Progress Is Not Made
During This Administration.
NEW YORK, March 9.-W. J. Bryan ar
rived here from Buffalo to-day. He said
he expected to remain here several days
on business connected with the Com
moner. â¢
"I stopped at Buffalo." said Mr. Bryan,
"and saw the Pan-American Exposition
grounds and buildings. The color scheme
Impresses me as better than the Chicago,
World's Fair and I believe the exposition
will be uulte as big a success as that of
1SS3." â¢
ivir. Bryan' said he would deliver no
speeches "and attend no public exercises.
He had nothing to say about free silver
or "paramount issues." He was ques
tioned about various matters of public in
terest and made the following replies:
"It looks as if the Nicaragruan canal
project had fallen throuph. The transcon
tinental railroads and the McKinley ad
ministration are responsible. The rail
roads are afraid that if the water was
used for the canal there would not be
enough left to water the stocks. If the
Republican party makes no more progress
in the next four years than It made in
the last four It will soon reach its finish.
This big steel combine is but another Illus
tration of the trusts we fought in the last
campaign.' The tendency Is to still fur
ther and larger consolidations of capital.
"The deadlock in the Nebraska Legisla
ture â oh, yes. that is easily explained.
You see there are only two Senatorships
at the disposal of the State and there are
more than two railroads. Each railroad
can't have a Senator, therefore trouble re
sulted."

CUSHION TEAS OR RUSHES? IS THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION ON THE
BERKELEY CAMPUS, AND UPON THE INFLUENCE OF THE CO-EDS
DEPENDS THE SOLUTION.
ysâ^ ERKEI.EY, March 9.â Whether
1^/ cushion teas or the more mas
*^V culine pastime of rushes are to
,\ >m J^ be the future functions at the
University of California Is tha
momentous question on the Berkeley cam
pus. This question is based upon the part
women students take in college- life, and
upon their sphere of influence, It Is gen
erally argued, depends the answer.
The rebellion of yesterday among tho
senior boys has quieted down. They are
going to hold their smoker and they are
going to keep out all co-eds. They are de
termined to run that function at least by
themselves. .Meanwhile the women are
preparing to keep up their part of man
aging college affairs.
Miss Agnes Frisius, president of the As
sociated Women Students, believes that
the Influence of the co-eda cannot be too
widely felt at college, regardless of the
fate of the rush or the tea. She says:
"The women are taking- an active part l:i
college affairs. It is right that they
should do so, for men can't understand
the nice little details of affairs like
â¢women. We are going to elevate life hera.
Now about class day. There have been
some unkind and unjust jokes on giris
heretofore, and we are determined that
our exercises shall be better and morally
purer than the others. With President
McKinley here our class day should be
the best that it could be made.
Consultation Had to Arrange for Salfi
CANADIAN GOVERNMENT
IN A RAILROAD DEAL
"Women should have as much say in
college affairs as the men. We should be
on an amicable basis with them. The se
nior boys are going to give a smoker and
they haven't said a word about inviting
us. I believe, however, they are to give
us a lawn party instead, which will per
haps do just as well."
"In some cases the women are taking
too prominent a part In university af
fairs." said J. W. S. Butler, president of
the senior class. "They have a right to
help regulate class day and basket-ball
and charter day plays, but when It comes
to athletics something should drop. It Is
of the Northern Pacific Lines
- . In Manitoba.
ST. PAUL, Minn., March 9.â The Dis
patch says: William Mackenzie, the rail
road macnate. who is behind the. deal
whereby the Canadian Government is to
buy up the Northern Pacific lines in Mani
toba, and General Superintendent Hanna
of the Canadian Northern arrived in St.
Paul to-day for the purpose of holding a
consultation with President Mellin in an
effort it is believed, to induce the rsorth
ern Pacific to somewhat amend its origi
nal proposition. : ; :. ;. "
Considerable opposition has manifested
Itself to the deal, as it entails more or
less expense for a number of years. There
is a very well developed feeling that the
Great Northern is back of the whole
scheme.
Mr. Mackenzie Is the owner to a very
large extent of the Canadian Northern
road, which company will offer to operate
the Northern Pacific for the Government
in case the Government buys the lines. It
would surprise no one if the Canadian
Northern would promptly transfer its
license to the Great Northern. The North
ern Pacific of course claims to care noth
ing about what is done with the lines
after they are sold, and If the Great
Northern should assume the obligation of
relieving the Canadian Government of the
expense of the purchase the Northern
Pacific would probably have no objection.
Mr. Mackenzie said late this afternoon
that the proposition to lease the recently
acquired Northern Pacific lines to the
Great Northern had never been proposed
and never could be considered.

SAX FRANCISCO. March 9.â Editor Call:
The late failure of the bakery proprietors of this
city to establish a uniform price uf bread and
the subsequent agnations of the journeymen
for better conditions are attracting unusual at
tention, leading many to inquire what really Is
the matter with those who supply us our dally
bread. ,
This baking business is very old. Its origin
Is so much obscured In the early centuries that
even in the time of the Israelites it waa In a
very crude state. No doubt bread was used in
Babylon, Nineveh, Tyre, Thebes and Jerusa
lem, but as there is no Information extant to
show that crain was prepared for baking pur
poses, other than by crushing between small
flat stones, worked by hand, we must conclude
that the bread of the kings and conquero" of
thoea times, however well they may have en-
Joyed rich wines from gold and silver goblets,
lacked the color and flavor that characterizes
the toothsome edible of to-day.
Grain must have figured largely in the food
of the ancients, for we find Pharaoh confiding
in Joseph and commanding him to gather and
Htore up grain to provide against an expected
famine. Boarding or the mo<lÂ«?rn truck uysicm
must have been in full swing at the time, for
we are told that people working on public
buildings, the ruins of which are to-day the
wonder and admiration of the world, were com
pensated In foodstuffs calculated to sutnee lor
thirty days, and because of some using up their
allowance In less than that time discontent
arose, leading to the first recorded strikes,
many of which the king in person had to In
vestigate, invariably cocneding the peop! es ' de
mand. _': ,i ;
Inferior Dark Sread in Greece.
Passing to Greece! Through the times of Us
republican glory, in the rinlshed splendor of Its
architecture, wtth tta host of orators, philoso
phers, heroes, poets and historians, the bread
was very Inferior dark stuff, and If any should
think the people then lived longer or enjoyed
better health than people of to-day, I beg to
remind them that in those days life from the
age of 55 was deemed a burden: usefulness was
thought to be past and nothing left but the
hemlock cup or falling on the point of a sword.
To-day men at â¬0 are generally ambitious, and
seldom tire even at 80.
The Roman legions conquered East and West,
subduing fierce, warlike races: were almost
constantly exposed to the elements, roughing
It on the march or preparing for conflict, and
they subsisted on black bread and sour wine.
In distant countries, such as Britain, dry
grain wos carried in' pouches suspended from
belts. This has been proved recently where

The Loaves Pound in Pompeii.
In the museum at Naples can be seen a
number of loaves taken from an oven in a
public bakery unearthed during excavations at
Fompell. A mill also was found with a heap
or -wheat, suppossd to have been ready for
grinding when the bnrning lava poured over
the city. After 1700 years excavators disclosed
to the modern world the habits, manners ani
customs of the people of that once gay an<l
beautiful city. Not the least of the many
Interesting utilities then existing in Roman
cities were the public bakeries. Roman em
perors, tyrants as many of them were, took a
deep Interest in the bread supplied the people
Of the Antonlnes. under whom Rome was at
Its best. Emperor Aurelius had a statue erected
to a prominent baker In appreciation of the
good bread made under his superintendence.
So numerous fcad bakers become during ths
middle uses that in co-operatlcn with men of
other callings as a means of protection they
organized Into associations or guilds, thereby
laying the foundation of a movement that has
been more or less active for centuries and
survives to-day under the modern title of
trades unionism.
Received Charters From Kings.
The London. Edinborough and Dublin guilds
received charters from Kings of England. The
Dublin St. Anne v Uuild of Bakers has an un
troRen existence since 1408. The Bakers' Na
tional Union of Pcotland dates from 1S40 and
that of Ireland 1870. It is a matter of record
that the Dublin society is the best managed
and Its members the nest paid skilled labor
ers in Europe since 1S70. It Is also a fact,
although not" generally known, that more large
bakeries are located In Dublin, more capital
invested, more bread consumed by Its people
(S50.C00) than In any orher cltf In the world
vlth a population of 42:1.000.
American fiour enters largely into the manu
facture of bread In the three kingdoms. It
may sound strange, yet it . Is true, that the
best Minnesota flour Is exported to those coun
tries and sold at 50 cents a barrel less than
In San Francisco. It was not many years ago
when, for two eeasons, the rream of Pacific
Coast' flour r.-as shipped via the Horn to Eu
rope and sold In 50,000-barrel cargoes at UÂ®
4 50 just the price charged to local bakers.
Probably non-union sailors at bed-rock wages
had something to do with low freights. In the
Minnesota case railroad charges regulate prices.
Yearly Consumption Increasing.
"We find as the population of civilized coun
tries increase, there is a keen inquiry as to
the amount of wheat likely to be available
by a g'.ven time; then speculation influences
prices. The yearly consumption of breadstutls
Is Increasing and Is certain to conct'nue. ow
lnK to Improvements in milling and use of
machtnery in large bakeries. The trend of
study is to devise means of increasing the
output per inan and reducing cost cf produc
tion, thereby Insuring the public good bread
at a minimum cost. Bakeries of this class
must use flour of superior quality; poor, cheap
stuff will not stand the power applied to
dough mixers, rollers and cutters; it would
go to pieces. Hence the time is not far dis
tant when San Francisco's bakeries must get
Into line wtth the progressive bakeries of the
world. What more convincing proof can be
offered than the successful grown of cracker
factories on this ccastâ all operated by machin
ery, making repular hours practicable-. Insur
ing better surroundings and making the manu
facture of good crackers a certainty. I know
of no reason why bread cannot be handled In
like manner. Many already admit the possi
bility of a successful new departure. The fact

men should work actively in all that per r
tains to the university and should leave
the stamp of the feminine everywhere â
even In rushes."
"These co-eds are altogether too numer
ous." said George Mansfield, a prominent
junior. "There are too many of them on
the campus. They are mixing up in our
affairs too much. Rushes gone, high Jinks
gone, charter dar scraps gone and noth
ing but cushion tea leftâ and -j-ou have to
pay to get out."
"The women students are doing what Is
correct." said P. A. Sinsbeimer, leading
member of the Bachelordom Club. "Their
help and influence are needed at all uni
versity gatherings. They help to elevate
the fellows. That's the general opinion
of the senior men."
Yebterday there were many senior men
who declared there was "too much co
ed." To-day they meekly submitted to the
influence of their sister students. Some
even appear to be highly enthusiastic over
the prospects of class days and rushes a
la co-ed, and thO3e who yesterday loudly
declared women students too numerous
hold that opinion as a mighty private one
to-day.
It is generally expected that the men of
the freshmen class will hold out against
the women much longer than their 6enlor
brothers. Being young, they haven't yet
reached the age where co-ed Influence
reaches them individuallyâ supposed to be
the direct cause of the senior downfall.
Now it's the question on the campus,

The two highwaymen, whom the police
captured an hour after the crime- was

their part in the robbery when put upon
their preliminary examination to-day.
"Zuhoff and I beat our way over to
Oakland on the ferry-boat from Saa
Francisco." said McGulre, "We rodÂ© to>
B-street station, got off the train and
went to a couple of saloons for whisky.
At the second saloon we met a stranger,
who says to us. 'Let's go out and hold up
the first man we meet.*
"That was agreeable and oft wÂ© went.
That man." pointing to Millan. who was>
sitting' in court, "was- the first onÂ© to
come along. We followed him until wÂ»
struck a dark place in the street. Then
I grabbed ono arm. Zuhoff grabbed the
other arm and the ether fellow hit tha
man on the head, knocking him out.
We went through his pockets, pot $1 35
ami spent it ir. a saloon for whisky. I
don't know who the other fellow was. Wa
left him r.nd went downtown, where we
wore arrested." . .
Zuhnff repeated his companion's story.
Detectives Kyte and Humerton told about
the highwaymen's confession to them.

Troubles Beings Adjusted.
At a conference of the committee ap
pointed by the sand teamsters through,
the San Francisco Labor Council and a
committee from their employers, held
yesterday afternoon, both sides of the
question were discussed at length. Time
was asked by the employers to consult
with parties affected before a final an
swer could be given. It is almost cer
tain that by to-morrow morning there
will be an end to the strike and the driv
ers who quit a week or* so ago will soon
be at work.
It Is expected that a conference will
also be held by committees from Schus
sler Bros, and the picture-frame workers.
and that existing difilculties will soon bo
settled.
There Is Just at present a little friction
existing between the retail- clerks and
their employers. The clerks still stand
for 6 o'clock closing, while the retail
storekeepers would like It to be extended
to 8 o'clock. It la probable a conference
committee will be appointed to try to ad-
Just this difference also.
The Journeymen butchers will conclnda
arrangements fcr the organization of a
union at a meeting called for that pur
pose this afternoon at 2 o'clock at Shiels
building-. 22 O'Farrell street. Durin? the
coming week" the vinegar and pickle work
ers, both male and female, will organize.
At a recent meeting of the cement
workers It was decided to purchase COO
worth of mill stock In addition to what
has already been subscribed for. The
Hotel and Restaurant Union has a mem
bership of 1250. with over 100 eligible
names to add.
The striklns sand teamsters have re
ceived liberal donations from \-arlous

ous time. There were addresses by tha

fered to the American people, not only geo-
graphical but historical, political and statis-
tical, making it the most useful reference
work that a library can contain.

did work for $1.50, or about one-fifth of

scribe at once in order to take advantage of
this golden opportunity.

be secured from any other source on this
coast, as The Call has the exclusive right to
handle it on the Pacific Coast.

ment census, brought down and corrected to
March 4, 1901.

tory in the Union.
Maps of Canada, Mexico,
Central America, Europe,
Asia, Africa, Australia-
In fact of every point on the globe, also
special maps of Alaska, the Philippines,

others not found in any other atlas-
Reliable Statistical Information.
History and Platforms of Political Parties.
Constitution of "the United States.
Chronological History of the World's Doings

This Atlas will be bound -in half Russia
and English silk cloth, printed on fine Atlas
paper, manufactured expressly for this edi-
tion. The greatest care will be exercised in
the binding, presswork, and in every part, to

heavy. aside from the stocks of some of the
companies not included In the United States
Steel corporation, in which a short interest has
trf>en driven to cover by an aggressive bull in
terest. The buying of stocks has been attri
buted to further extension of the community
of interest policy and was reported to be for
account of competing and connecting railroad
systems.
The Grangers. e*pecially Burlington, the Pa
cifies, the Southwesterns and the tide-water
bituminous coal carriers have all been afTected
by this influence. ThÂ» last-named group was
benefited by the showing made in the annua!
report of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.
The good results reported in (his document of
the better freight rates secured by the rom
par;y'B jayrchase of influential holdings In com
peting lines, e?p?clal!y the. rates for soft coal,
created a strong demand fcr Baltimore and
Ohio, Chesapeake and Ohio and Norfolk and
Western. It was the current br-llef in Wall
Hreet thai before the rnjyin* war on account
of the Pennsylvania Â«"ompÂ«nv itself. The
Pennsylvania annual report had a stimulating
effect r>n the whole railway list frcm its re
flection of the prorperous condition of the
transportation Industry in all the diversified
brnrcbe^ retÂ»rÂ» wnted by that company. The
Â«tr>clc touched a remrti pric-Â» during the Â«n>l!

supply of Etorks seeking a market was not
large. The recent buying by competing rail
road interests, bankers ajid capitalists for pur
pores of Influencing control. h** evidently
much reduced the floating supply of securities
in many directions. A featui* of the> market
has been the movement of stocks of the small
eT railroads, whclh seem In any way available
for absorption by the larger railroad systems.
ihere haÂ« been a furious speculation In Amal
gamated Copper, with thÂ« price well over the
par for the first time since the etock waa
issued. Sugar has also had its usual specula
tion Incident to the dividend period. The
neglect of the steel stocks after the publica
tion or the official circular containing the terms
of the consolidation has caused much . com
ment. The prices of exchange of securi
ties hamper operation* In them In the mar
ket. Provision has been made for dealing in
the trust certificates lpsued for the stocks of
the Steel and Iron companies deposited In
assent to the plan. But there is nothing in
existence to represent the new United States
Steel stocks, beyond Individual contracts to
deliver them when Issued. â¢ r>eal!ngs In these
have oontlnu^d In the curb market in a very
moderate scale and their price has beÂ«n held
above that ruling for the old securities. Opin

tions is u. factor In the stock market for the
present. Any decisive development In the
South African war is bound to have an in
fluence on the money markets of the world,
owing to the renewal of the gold supply which
would follow. Crop prospects will have grow

The question of wage adjustment among coal
miners Is given attention by stock operators.

CHICAGO, March 9.â At the opening the
wheat market expressed its greatest activity.
May opened Uc higher at 75%g75Â»4c under the
encouragement of higher markets at Liverpool
and Antwerp, the chief Argentine market on
the Continent, and because of unfavorable
climatic conditions. A heavy trade for the
outside account was transacted at the start,
but it was wrll distributed on both sides.
Shorts, who became alarmed yesterday, were
still anxious to cover, however, and May was
worked up to 75-Ti'o during the first hour. Trade
following the nrst half-hour's activity was
more quiet. On the bulge what had been In
fluential support was withdrawn and this, com
bined with some profit-taking by scalplns
lonfirs, caused a decline to 75^1Â®n^ic. Buyin*
orders which had been waiting caught the de
cline and when more shorts took their medicine
the market experienced another rally to^i-Tic
and clcscd U@9Â»e higher at 75?4c.
Corn opened higher i:nder a sharp outside
inquiry and a decided scarcity of offerings,
due to 'the road-spoiling weather and to higher
cables. An influential speculator began ham
mering the market, but although he dumped
a big quantity in the pit May declined slowly
end stubbornly, closlns only a shade lower at
4'>vfci?41c.
O.its were the weakest of the list aa usual.
May do*od hiH^c lower at 24TÂ»c.
Pork again headed tne bill in the provision
pit. The demand was not as brisk as it was
yesterday, but ns offerings were notably light
the price ran up sharply. Light hog receipts
and higher prices at the yards were bullish
factors in the market. May pork closed firm
and unchanged, lard and ribs closing un
changed from yesterday.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, March 0.â The weekly state
ment of averages of the associated banks show:
Loans, $918.7*3.600; increase, Â»4.SS0.200.
Deposits. I1.011.92S.400: decrease, *5S5.E00.
Circulation, $31,469,000: increase, $160,000.
Legal tenders, $72.5oo,3C0; decrease, $1,415,800.
Specie. $151,134,100: decreas?, $4,330,200.
Reserve requirements, $252>9S2,125; decrease.
$146,275.
Surplus reserve, $10,717,275; decrease, $4,053,025.
The Financier says: Despite the fact that
one or more of the larger banks began to call
loans last week the current exhibit of the New
York clearing-house Institutions shows an ex
pansion in the loan item of $4,5SO,200. . It is
rather difficult to trace satisfactorily the cause
of this rise, but in explanation It may be said
that operations Incident to the completion of
larger deals are reflected to a greater or less
extent in the change. The increases and de
creases are confined for the most part to a
few banks which represent special interest and
magnitude. By far thÂ» most Interesting part
of the statement Is found In the depletion of
$4,320,200 in the cash reserves of the bank. The
loss is the heaviest that has been noted in
any week since last October and was brought
about by sub-treasury operations with the
hanks. The treasury, in fact, gained nearly
five millions during the week and this was
counteracted only slightly by interior remit
tances. From Chicago. Philadelphia and other
centers, however, come advices of extremely
ea*y money markets and any heightened de
mand for money here will no doubt be met
with a response from all large points which
have funds in excess of current needs. As a
rule, however, the excess reserves of the New
York banks show -a falling oft over the March
period. A year ago this week the banks held
less than six millions of reserve and the suc
ceeding six-day period witnessed a further de
cline of two and two-thirds millions, from
which low point there was a steady rise, which
did not culminate until September. The de
posit Items for the week Just ended showed

HER OWN IDEAS ABOUT OP
ERA MANAGEMENT.
UPON* the close of the present the
atrical season Alice Xielsen Is to
"paddle her own canoe." A dif
ference of opinion as to the man
ner In which a theatrical star
FhouM perform has led to the severance
of the business relations existing between
ihe finger and the backer of the company
la which *=he starred.
Thomas 11. Williams Jr., whose money
Mr. Williams did not care to discuss any
further the question of the proposed
change.
Alice Nielsen was here last December
v/itn an all-star aggregation and occupied
the boards at the Columbia for two weeks
She made a decided hit with her produc
tions of the "Fortune Teller" and tho
"Singing: Girl." It is said that Miss Xiel
sen will go to London with her troupe.
Miss Nielsen s views are so at variance
with those of Mr. Perley and myself that
we have determined to sever our business
connection at the end of the present sea
son. A mutual agreement was reached
last December when the oppra company
was here. Mr. Perley and I are ln tho '
theatrical business and Intend to continue
as before." i
first enabled the opera Blngrer to engage
ln the theatrical venture which has netted
her a world-wide reputation, and Frank
L. Perley. her business manager, have
Ideas of their own concerning the man
agement of a theatrical venture; and so
has Miss Nielsen. The ideas of the man
ager and the backer and those of the
singer did not Jibe, and the result is that
at the close of the present season the fair
Alice will star under other than her pres
ent managers.

? vT e a . ct und <>r which the new order of
ii ? s . is P rov ided reads as follows; "In
all cities (of the first class) and cities and
counties of this State where a regular po
lice department is maintained patrol cap
tains, lieutenants, sergeants and regular
otiicers shall be required to serve on duty
not longer than eight hours in every
twenty-four hours; provided, that in case
*r *v? or , otner emergency every attache
i 2 J ;ollce department shall perform
such duty and for such time as the direct
ing authority of the department shall. re-
The bill Introduced Into the Assembly
by Henry limiting: the time of daily serv
ice of members of the Police Department
to eight hours and which* received the
Governor's signature Friday, will necessi
tate an increase to the forco at once, as
the bill provides that tho law shall take
effect immediately.
Attempts have been made ln the past to
have the force Increased to the number
provided by law in accordance with tho
population, but without result, as the
Boards of Supervisors always pleaded
economy. The effect has been that men
have had to work overtime, and even then
the city was not patrolled as it should be,
the outlying districts being the sufferers.
ln speaking of the new law Chief Sulli
van said yesterday that he roughly esti
mated it would take about 200 additional
men to meet the requirements. He said:
i nave no power to increase the force,
as that duty devolves upon the Board of
faupervisors, which has to supply the
runcis. The board refuses to do anything,
as there are no funds, so I do not know
wnat is to be done. Putting on the addi
tional men would increase the payroll by
over J2U0.O0O per annum."
There are at present 200 men on each
?. 1 . .' and ll would -require at least 173
additional men for another watch of eight
nours, besides more sergeants and lieu
tenants. The patrolmen receive $100 per
month, sergeanis $125 per month and lieu
tenants $140 per month, so that the in
creased expenditure can readily be estl-
The purpose of that opinion on its very face
is to monopolize as large a portloruof that sur
plus ns possible for street Improvements, re
garrtWs of the clalm3 of crtditors. The -valid j
claims amount to about $30O,d0O. while thÂ» ?ur- '
plus will not pxooed |2M.0tnÂ». I make the pre- |
diction that less than $100,000 will be distributed '
among the creditor* at the end of the fiscal I
year. The schoolteachers will net a portion of
that, and they probably will never be paid the
balance.
If the Supervisor* would ccnal.ier thew claims Â¦
now and approve all thnt they believe are Kevi
uimv and honest, and then permit aHalgnmein ,
to one or more parties for the purpose of tuk-
Ing Judgment, the Supervisors waiving appeal, i
such demands would have a direct claim on thÂ« ;
surplus fund under* the charter provisions. If
this is not done. I repeat, no man can tell when
th*y will be nnld.
I can see nothing In the constitutional amend
ment that requires the puyment of interest on
the c!ty"s old Indebtedness. There in nothing '
mandatory about any purt t>f it. nothing to :
prevent the Supervisors from settling the i
claims on a percentage even, e >
If Lane's opinion la a.lheiv.1 to It seemn to me '
that the city has no Intention of paying Us f
debts; that It mÂ«y pÂ«y a portion of whnt it i
owe*.- but neither the schoolteachers nor other* Â¦
who have â¢waited for jeuriÂ» will be settleil with f

Auditor Wells Is of the odnJon that
should the most recent opinion of City
Attorney Lane in regard to the paymenc
of the city's old indebtedness be followed
it will be tantamount to a repudiation by
the city of the back claims, the payment
of which is made possible by the adoption
of the constitutional amendment. In h!3
opinion Lar.e holds that the claims neod
not be put in Judgment and that the in
terest thereon- must be paid at the race
of 5 per cent per annum from the time
the liabilities were Incurred. The Auditor
takes issue with I^ne. He unbosomed
himself yesterday. in the. following signeJ
statement:
Following Lane's Opinion
Would Be Repudiation,
Auditor Says.
CITY MAY EVADE
ITS JUST DEBTS
The servant then became possessed of
the idea that Mr. Tilden had become sud
denly Insane, and locked him up in the
room. Naturally enough. Mr. Tilden be
came excited at receiving such treatment
and commenced hammering on the door
to have It opened. The servant thereupon
became greatly Â«vscited and rang in an
alarm for the police. They soon arrived
with an ambulance and Mr. Tilden was
taken to the Receiving Hospital. He was
greatly excited and incensed over the ill
treatment received, but being a mute was
unable to explain himself. He was given

sleep was as' well as ever."
Drs. Bradley and Webster, who made
an examination into the matter, yesterday

and. accompanied by his wife and several
friends, he returned to his home. There

"All this unpleasant and unnecessary
notorietjMs due to the misapprehension of
a servant employed ln Mr. Tilden's home,"
said A. H. Brown, a half-brother of the
sculptor, yesterday. "Mr. Tilden was with
his class at the Art Institute Friday, and
when he left he felt tired and weak. He
went to a drugstore and procured a stim
ulant, as he had an engagement to meet
some friends at dinner in the evening. He
kept his engagement and left for Oak
land on the 10 o'clock boat, accompanied
by Theodore H. Grady, an attorney and
personal friend. When he reached home
he discovered that he had forgotten his
latch key. Not caring to wake the family
by ringing the doorbell, he gently forced
open a window and ir. that way gained en
trance to the house. The servant, who
had been employed in the house only a
few days, met him In the hallway. He
thought that Mr. Tilden was acting In a
peculiar manner, and went with him to
his room.
. Douglas Tilden, the well-known sculp
tor, who was taken to the Oakland Re
ceiving Hospital Friday night to be held
pending an examination before the Com
missioners of Insanity, was discharged
yesterday and returned to his home at
1545 Webster street, Oakland. Mr. Tilden
has fully recovered his mental faculties,
and on Tuesday next will resume his du
ties as instructor of modeling at the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art. The aberration
was only temporary, and when Tilden
awoke yesterday morning he was greatly
surprised to learn that his sanity had
been questioned.
Douglas Tilden Pronounced
Sane by the Lunacy
Commissioners.
