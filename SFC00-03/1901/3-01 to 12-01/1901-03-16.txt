OUTWITTING BRITISH FORCES
LONDON, March IB.â The Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York
started this afternoon on the first
stage of their tour \ of the four
quarters of the globe. Kng Ed
ward, Queen Alexandra and other mem
bers of the royal family accompanied the
travelers to Portsmouth, whence the
Bteamer Ophir, with the Duke and Duch
ess on board, will sail to-morrow. Tho
departure of the King and Queen from
Marlborough House was accompanied by
a semi-state ceremonial.
LONDON, March 15. â A dispatch received here from
Tientsin by Reuter's Telegram Company, dated from that
city to-day at 3:20 p. m., says: "The Russians are now en
trenching in the disputed territory. A company of the Hong
kong regiment, with fixed bayonets, is in front, while two
companies of. the Madras Pioneers, under the command of
Major Johnson, are held in reserve. Both the Russians and
British are awaiting instructions from their Governments."
BERING, March 15. â The Russians at Tientsin took
possession of the railway siding, and armed sentries
are now guarding it. General Barrow (second in
command of the British forces) hesitates to act, apparently in
the absence of General Gaselee, feeling sure that bloodshed
would ensue. He had a long consultation to-day with Sir
Ernest Satow, British Minister.
The Russians are jubilant. The American military line
has been sold to a private company.
LONDON, March 16.â A question In
the House of Commons yesterday
relative to the Tientsin dispatch
announcing friction between the
Russians and British there elicited
a confirmation from Lord Georgo Hamil

The Chancellor traced the deliberations
of the powers, following which negotia
tions had been entered upon with China.
Referring to the punishments inflicted on
the mandarins as a result, of Boxer atroc
ities, the Chancellor declared that the
powers were not actuated by thirst for
blood, but by a desire to make an example
of the guilty. To let them go free would
have amounted. to a charter for similar
misdeeds in the future. He suggested
that the mission of Prince Chun to.Berlin

An Example of the Guilty.
The debate on the supplementary esti

In anticipation of something: Interesting
occurring, both the floor of the house and
the galleries were filled. The Chancellor
began by declaring that the negotiations
on the Chinese question were making
slow but steady progress. Although It
had not been easy to secure an agreement,
owing .to the naturally conflicting inter
ests of the different governments, It had
been possible to draw up a reasonable
peace programme. The harmony of the
powers, thus far, had -been preserved and
hope was entertained that the feeling of
solidarity among .the civilized nations
would suffice to overcome the "differences

For many months past tho cattle ranch
of Campbell in Cochlse County, Arizona,
has been overrun by various species of
wild animals, and their depredations had
become bo frequent that material loss was
suffered and 10,000 head of cattle on the.
ranges had been ravaged so often the
dividends of the company had been per
ceptibly cut down. Last week Charles

who accompanied General Crook in his

mountain lions, black and grizzly bears.
Montgomery secured one hundred Pima
Indian bucks to assist him and the band
took the field last Saturday at daybreak.
A district five miles square in the foot
hills adjacent to the Chlricahua Moun
tain range was surrounded and the long
line of Indians and cowboys was gradually
drawn closer. A horde of black bear,
grizzlies, coyotes and mountain lions was
driven to the center by hunters and their
200 dogs. Many of the beasts, especially
the bears, became Infuriated from the at
tacks of the dogs and attempted to break

greeted with volleys.
There were many close conflicts and
four Indians were so terribly mangled by
grizzlies that they died. A former chle!
of the Pima tribe was also eo badly hurt

Gould Family Arranges to
Control Great South
western System.
CHICAGO, March 15.â The Times-Her
ald to-morrow will say: Events of the
past few weeks have made It certain that
the Missouri Pacific is shortly to be made
trie greatest system of the Southwest,
With the Missouri Pacific as the nucleus
a system will be built up and put under
one management, extending from Buffalo
to New Orleans. El Paso and Salt Lake.
Such Is the plan which is being 1 ' worked
out by the Gould family and it is equal
to the boldest scheme projected by the
late Jay Gould.
The latest evidence in this respect is the
announcement that the Goulds have ac
quired control of the Denver and Rio
Grande and will soon have the Rio Grande
Western. It is also understood that the
Missouri Pacific now has control of the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas, which ex
tends to St. Louis via Parsons, and Dallas
to Galveston, and that the extension from
Bt. Louis to Paris and southwest to Okla
homa will soon be acquired by tho Goulds.
By these purchases the Missouri Pacific
will not only extend Its "Western limit to
Ogden, but will occupy the mountain
passes to an extent that will make it dif
ficult for other roads to secure ingress on
a profitable footing. The Missouri Pacific
is In close relations with tho Union Pa
cific and other properties under syndicate
control and will, therefore, be in a situa
tion to work harmoniously west from Salt
LakÂ« City and El Paso.
Proceeding, Lord Lansdowne questioned
the correctness of some of Lord Wolee
ley's statements. He reminded the latter
how. after the Glencoe disaster, ho had
suggested that the British should fall
back behind the Tugela. If the order had
been given earlier it might have eavexl
one of the most untoward events of the
war. Lieutenant General Sir William
Butler had written a private letter to
Lord Wolseley suggesting that 40,000 men,
might be necessary for the campaign.
Lord Lansdowne did not wish to excuse
himself for underestimating the enemy,
but Lord \W)lesley should bear his full
Fhare. Lorcf Wolseley suggested, among
other things, the occupation of Delagoa
Bay and an appeal to the colonies.
Lord Salisbury said he thought it un
desirable that all the papers referred to
in the debate should be circulated. Ho
was not aware that any personal charges
had been made against Wolseley.
Lord Rosebery enumerated Lord Lans
downe's charges against Lord Wolseley
and said they were personal In the gen
eral judgment of the mass of tho House
and the men in the street. He alluded to
Lord Wolseley's historic career, now
closed, and defended the slngle-mlnded
ness of his purpose in seeking to improve
the War Office.
Lord Wolseley's motion waa rejected
by a vote of C2 to 38.
Some Mistakes of Wolseley.
Lord Wolseley admitted that, in com
mon. with all the other authorities, he had
underestimated the fighting power of the
individual Boer. Three weeks before
Kruger's declaration of war he had urged
Ivord Lansdowne to send out an army
corps, a. cavalry division and live bat
talions for the lines of communication, !n
addition to the 10,000 troops already in
South Africa. Such a comparatively
small number of troops employed early
had often achieved results which live
times their number could not produce
later. The mobilization of this force at
that, time would have produced a consid
erable effect in South Africa. If the
country was not prepared at the outbreak
of the war it was not because be had not
urged the gradual and unostentatious re
intorcement of the forces.
Lord Wolseley concluded with saying:
"1 have said as little as possible consist
ent with any Justice to myself. Th.3 no
ble Marquis made strong personal state
ments which were not supported. I have
made my reply, which is also unsupport
ed. I cannot, however, leave the matter
thus. I feel I am amply justified In mov
ing that all the papers bo laid on the
table. I am prepared to prove by official
documents all I have said."
Lord Lansdowne, in reply, said he
thought Lord Wolseley had hardly com
prehended the purport of . his former
speech when he said it was a personal at
tack on himself. Lord Wolseley could
hardly expect that he would not retali
ate.
Boers Were Underestimated.
Wolseley refuted the specific charges
launched by Lord Lansdowne. He said
he had made every effort to improve tne
auxiliary forces. In February, 189U, he
recommended that additional troops be
sent to South Africa and recommended
strengthening the Natal garrisons and the
defensive occupation not of the town of
Ladysmith but of the Biggarsberg Range,
which was twenty-live miles in advance
of Ladysmith. He had never considered
l^ady.smith and Its surrounding hills to
be tenable. :- .' â¢:
Lord Wolseley in his opening remarks
said "he regretted being compelled to dis
cuss a personal matter, but he could not
pass unchallenged the severe comments
of Lord Lansdowne on the manner in
which he had performed the duties of
commander in chief. Lord Liansdowne's
personalities were evidently premeditated.
His indictments were grave and it almost
seemed as if the personal attack was
made in order to divert attention from
the question at issue and throw upon the
commander in chief blame for the mis
takes made by the Uovernment. Until
the rocent debate he had never had rea
son to suppose that he did not posaess the
full conlidence of Lord Lansdowne and
the Cabinet. Early in 1CKW circumstances
arose which 'left him no alternative but
to resign, which he did. If he did not
possess the Cabinet's confidence that was
an object which might have teen used to
appoint a new commander in chief. *

that he rarely sleeps within the bounds of

NEW YORK, March 15.â Andrew Car
negie, who, since retiring as an active fig
ure Jn the steel world, has been able to
devote his time exclusively to his othÂ»Â»r
passionâ the founding' of librariesâ h;is
made his departure for Europe this spring

Sixty-fire branch libraries in this city.
ST. LOUIS, March 15.â Andrew Carne
gie has offered to donate $1,000,000 for the
building of a new public library in St.
Louis. The offer is similar to many oth
ers which Mr. Carnegie has made to cities
throughout the United States and abroad.
The conditions on which the Rift is to
be made are to be easily complied with
by thÂ»> city of St. Ixiuls. Mr. Carnegie
asks thnt the city furnish an unincum
bcrcd site for the library, and that a
maintenance fund of $130,000 per year be
assured.

If accepted it will result in the greatest

We may fairly infer that Mr. Carnegie's
idea is that the whole system should be
under cne management, that of the trus
tees of the Now York Public Library, but
this is not made one of his conditions. A3
to the question of sites, it is not improb
able that a considerable number could be
obtained without cost to the city through
gifts of public-spirited citizens.
"It Is of the greatest importance that
tho present buildings should be supple

be commenced upon it the bettf-r for tho
people and for the municipality as a
whole. My estimate that it will take five
years to provide and equip all the build
ings necessary is probably a reasonable
or.e. but If the matter is taken up prompt
ly by iho municipal authorities it would
seem as if this time could be shortened.
No doubt' there are some rather difficult
questions as to details to be/ settled, but
there are a number of very competent
persons to settle them, and the interest of

It took three hours of work to extin

were obliged to jump several feet to thÂ»

Stuart's Catarrh Tablets have been on
the market scarcely one year, yet they
have met with such popularity and suc-
cess 'that druggists everywhere In the
United States and Canada now have them
in stock and report a constantly increas-
ing demand for them.
The remarkable success of the new ca-
tarrh remedy. Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
Is because it drives out of the system
through the natural channels the ca-
tarrhal poison, the serma of grip, bron-
chitis and consumption that causa thÂ»
hawking, spitting- and gagging because
the excessive secretion is no longer sup-
plied when the blood Is made healthy
from the regular use of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets.
The remedy Is in the form of largs 20-
graln lozenges, pleasant and palatable,
composed only of wholesome antiseptics
and so safe to use that little children us*
them with perfect safety and benefit if
the little one is suffering from colds,
croup or cough from any cause.
Inhalers, sprays, powders and douches
are all applied locally and give temporary
relief, often for only a few hours, and It
is doubtful if anything like a real cure of
catarrh was ever accomplished by the uso
of local applications.
Catarrh is a constitutional disease: it la
in the blood like rheumatism, and to euro
It requires an internal medicine to act
upon the blood to drive out the catarrhal
poison from the system entirely, and any
one can readily we that a salve or pow-
der or inhaler which simply clears off th*
mucous membrane of the nose and throat
can have no effect on the real cause of
catarrhal disease.
There are few troubles for which therÂ»
are so many remedies and so-called
"cures" as for catarrh, and it may bÂ«
added there are few diseases so difficult
to really and permanently cure.

VANCOUVER, B. C, March 15.-Twen
ty keepers and guards of the Provincial
Asylum for the Insane at New Westmin
ster have gone on strike. They constitute
nearly the entire force at the asylum,
which institution Is now running itself.
j while an attempt is being made by the
few members of the staff, who have not
refused to work longer for the Govern
ment, to keep the inmates In restraint.
Two dangerous lunatics escaped this aft
ernoon and for a time the town Â¦was in
terror. To-night the patients were all
safely housed again and public attention
is turned to the grievances of the officials.
/ The asylum contains KO patients, there
being one keeper or guard to each ten in
mates. A Government investigation Into
the affairs of the asylum waa recently
held and the management was severely
criticized. As a result. Dr. Bodington, the
medical superintendent, resigned and his
assistant, Dr. Manchester, was appointed
in his place.
Manchester's first act was to reduce ex
penses, and he dismissed four guards.
T.ie officials held many meetings, passed
resolutions of protest and llnally formsO
themselves into a Lunatics' Guard Union
and defied the new management of the
asylum. The union asks for Increased
wages. Xot one man will go back to work
unless all are reinstated and there the
matter stands. An attempt will be made
to-morrow to impress the police force into
service.
Excitement ran high when the lunatics
began to escape this afternoon. Michael
Farquarsen, a Hungarian, who committed
murder while insane, started down town,
scaring everybody in his path. He chased
several women and threatened to kill
some children who were coming from
school. Then he went to the office of the
Brunett sawmill and inquired for the late
manager, who died two years ago. A
trembling clerk, who was alone at the
time, replied that the man he sought could
not be found. The Insane man then told
the rlcrk to prepare for death, as he in
tend :d to kill him quickly. The clerk man
aged to reach the telephone and kept the
lunatic at bay until help arrived. It re
quired the combined efforts of five men to
take the lunatic back to the asylum.
The second escaped patient was found
with less difficulty.
All the women and children of the town
shut themselves up In their homes th'a
evening. With the small guard at ths
asylum there Is danger that half the pa
tients will escape..

MENTO. March 13.â The caucus agree
ment on the reapportionment bill was sus
tained in tho Assembly to-day, but not
until after Johnson had made his last ef
fort to overturn it. In spite of his oppo
sition, the report of the free conference
committee was sustained by a vote of 4S
ajos to 19 noes. The Assembly by this
action receded from its amendments to
the Senate bill, accepting the Senate's ap
portionment of Assembly districts. John
son said in opposition that he did not feel
bound by the action of a caucus which
had adopted no resolution pledging those
participating to support the agreement
reached.
"Further than that," Johnson paid. "It
seemed to me that a third of the members
came fresh from another caucus where It
was decided what should be done."
Johnson's reference was to* the combina
tion by which Assemblyman Higby of San
Benito and some of his friends "and the
friends of Senator Flint. Including Rad
elifT. Anderson of Solano. Anderson of
Santa Clara, Walker. Wright and others
agreed to support the Curtin franchise as
sessment bill in return for the support of
the friends of that measure for the Sen
ate apportionment scheme. Johnson ar-
Bued that tho apportionment bill, ignor
ing population as it did. would be held to
be unconstitutional. There was no fur

OAIvT^ HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 15.â It took another strug
pl<Â» In the Assembly to-day to save the
Curtin franchise assessment bill. On
motion to reconFider. the foes of this little
un<5erFtr>od measuTc mustered almost
strength enough to win the day, but
though they outnumbered the friends of
the bill by fix fhey lacked four of having:
enough votes to carry the motion to re
consider.
A "bus." la the form of one of the
amendments adopted on Wednesday,
alienated a number of the friends of the
bill, but a. combination on the apportion
ment scheme of the Senate won enough
more to maintain supremacy. The amend
ment which aroused antagonism was that
which provided that the full cash value
of ail ncn-assessable property held by a
corporation, as well as the full cash value
of a!l property assessed to it. shall be sub
irac-.rd from tlie full cash value of its
entire capital stock to determine the
assessable value of its franchise. John
eor.. Cowan. Dur.lap. Myers. Sheridan and
other* pointed out that this meant an im
muse advantage to banks and other cor
porations that have large holdings in Gov
ernment bonds cr other non-assessable
property. Myers made a strong argument
afrainst the bill, independent of the
amendment in question. He denounced it
as a measure drawn in the interests of the
corporations as against those of the peo
ple.
There was a. call of the House, in the
midst of Â¦which the hour for the noon re
cess arrived, and Speaker Peniileton Ig
nored the lesson he had learned a few
days a^o in parliamentary rules, and de
clared recess. In consequence all efforts
Co persuade members to break away from
the influences which held them in line for
the bill were negatived, and when at 2
o'clock proceedings were resumed the op
ponents of the bill grave up the fight. The
motion to .reconsider had thirty-seven ayes
as ajrain^t thirty-one noes, forty-one ayes
being necessary
The amended bill would have been reeon-
Bblered and defeated except for a com
bination rntcred into last night by which
wmf â¢Mg-ht or ten members tieii them
selves up tn vote acainst reconsideration;
!n trad* for the support of the like con
tingent for tho San Benito apportionment
scheirp. That fact alienated some of the
men. like Johnson, who objected to "bow
ir.gr the knee" to the Senate, but not
enough vtrre gained by the other side to
offset its losses through the combination.
The amended bill v.as reported back to the
(Senate and after a test debate, in which
Ouriin fouirht for the bill as returned, the
action of the Assembly was concurred in

LOS ANGELES. March 15.â When the
citrus fruit shipping season opened in No
vember the crop In sight was the greatest
ever known in Southern California, the
railroad officials estimating: it at from
22,000 to 25,000 carloads. "Whon the officials
were questioned they gave assurances
that they realized the magnitude of the
task which was before them in transport
ing the fruit to the Eastern markets.
Growers and shippers ttustÂ«d to them to
rise to the emergency and save the crops.
In this they have been cadly disappointed.
Not only have the railroads kept the ship
pers from .obtaining cars when wanted
but, when the cars were once loaded, they
have been left to stand, days at. a time,
on the desert sidetracks of Southern Cali
fornia and -Arizona, where ventilation was
Impossible and where rhe fruit went down
under the heat until it became a mass of
rot.
The markets of the East, flooded with
decayed fruit, have broken under the
strain and. for days the total receipts at
Eastern auction houses have not been suf
ficient to pay the toll freights on the fruit
sold.
There are in Southern California at the
present time from 3.000,000 to 4.000,000 boxci
of oranges. On a conservative estimate
the fruit ought to be worth not less than
$5,000,000. Under the present delay in
transit, however. It is questionable
whether that magnificent body -of fru:t
represents any value. As It is now being
marketed it stands not only as a compara
tive loss to the growers or shippers, but
in addition to the fruit all expenses of
harvesting, packing and loading r.re a
dead loss.
There Is no remedy in sight. Tha ship
pers are beginning to send out their fruit
under refrigeration, but unless there, can
be a restoration of prompt movement of
cars when loaded icing wtil not save them.
Meanwhile the growers and shippers of
oranges through all portions of. Southern
California are getting no assurances that
the evil Is to end. Denials of the allega
tions of car shortage have little balm for
shippers who have beau and are still be
ing denied cars.

I have determined on Paine's Celery Com-
pound as my family remedy from now on.
E. C. MACHEN'.
As the pioneer of a new system of rail-
road building in the South. Machen knows
what it is to live under intense nervous
strain. His Jov at finding in Paine's Cel-
ery Compound a reliable means of restor-
ing his nervous energy is shown in every
line of his letter to the proprietors of this
great remedy.
"When thousands of men and women in
every walk of life, from the humblest to
the most famous and honored, voluntarily
go out of their way to tell others the great
good Paine's Celery Compound has done
them; when the ablest physicians and tho
best informed pharmacists not only pre-
scribe and recommend, but themselves
use and find health In Paine's Celery Com-
pound, the present great demand for the
spring remedy is not to be wondered at.
Paine's Celery Compound Is the. one real
spring remedy known to-day that never
falls to benefit. It cures diseases due to
nervous weakness or a bad state of tha
blood. The most wideawake. Intelligent
part of every community In this country
are among- its most enthusiastic vouchers
and lndorsers.
The agreement of opinion among the
best informed, most observant class of
people. In the well-to-do homes of our
largest cities, as well as in the more fru-
gal town communities, places Paine's Cel-
ery Compound far In advance of any
spring remedy.
It is, In fact, the only spring remedy
ever heard of in the homes of practicing
nhvsicians.
Machen Is one of the makers of the new
South. He has changed the map of Cen-
tral Georgia. Flourishing towns have
sprung up along the railroad lines he has
developed.
Hon. Clark Howell, In an editorial In the
Atlanta Constitution, said of him: To the
people of Georgia Machen Is known prin-
cipally by the roads he has built in the
South. He has brought all Georgia with-
in hand-reach cf Atlanta. He Is a public
benefactor.
While at work on the Covlngton and
Macon Railroad Machen's health failed.
After much useless expenditure of time
and money he was Induced by a friend
Â¦who had been cured of nervous prostra-
tion to try Paine's Celery Compound.
That the remedy waa a revelation to him
no one can doubt who reads Machen's
letter:
S9 Wall St.. New Tork.

"Wells, Richardson & Co.,
Burlington. Vt.
Gentlemen: I spent many thousands of
dollars. Including eight months abroad,
for nervous prostration, and then found
Paine's Celery Compound the remedy I
ought to have taken at first. Doctors peri-
odically tinkered at and patched me up so
that my nerve's would hold together for a
short while, seemingly just long enough
for my bank account to get a respite.
However, your medicine has eide-tracked
the doctors. My nerves don't seem to re-
quire any rest, and I am In such good
spirits these days It doesn't matter much
â¢whether I have any bank account or not.

ciously and the gunmen surprised even

played next month, and although tho
Hardys will not take part It will be an
Interesting event, as the players are very
evenly matched. 'The tryouts at Stanford
were won by Dick Adams and William
Roth, who will represent their college In
singles. The fact that Harry Welhe will
not play for Stanford in singles has occa
sioned much surprise, as he is by far the
best player that college can produce.
With Weiho out of the singles, Stanford's
chances of victory are lessened. Dick
Adams and Harry Weihe, the famous
pony team, should win tho doubles on
team work if nothing else, but they will
have to play good tennis to beat Drum
rnond McGavIn and Paul Selby, the Cali
fornia double steam. The latter team has
been practicing constantly of late and
plays a very strong game. The Califor
nia doubles tryout will be held next Sat
urday at Berkeley. Reuben Hunt and
Fred Brown are a strong team, but owing
to a lack of practice on the part of tho
former they will probably go down before
Selby and McGavin. A match between
Hunt and Weihe would be very close and
tennis cracks have been looking forward
to It for many months. California will
be represented In singles by Hunt and'
Selby or McGavin, all of whom are crack
players. At present It looks as if both
singles events will go to U. C, but should
Dick Adams regain his old form he would
be a very dangerous opponent. Roth, the
other Stanford man. plays brilliant tennis
at times, but is a very streaky player.

"Big BUI" Lange could not be i.auied
back into the national game by a team of
oxen. The tempting offers made by var>
ous baseball managers for the clever ball
player's services have been parsed up by
Lanpe as If they were mere bagatelles.
Lange has doCfed his suit and shaken the
dust of the diamond eff his shoes for all
time. He has taken this course at tho
request of his wife and because his pres
ent business demands all his attention.
I^ange has the distinction of having re
ceived the highest. offer ever made a ball
player. It is true that Kelly and Clarkson,
the $20,000 battery, were released to an
other club for an immense sum, but their
individual salaries never amounted to
more than H'.GQ. "Buck" Ewine received
the highest salary ever paid a ball-player.
He was paid $5000 for his services, but
that was in the days when the Brother
hood fight was on. Lange was offered $3000
and expenses to play on the Boston team.
When It was taken Into consideration that
he would only have to play five months
in the reason, all his expenses would be
paid and his railroad faie from this citv
to Boston would also be paid, it will
dawn on the average "fan" that Lange
Is in great demand.
Henry Harris, manager of the San
Franciscos, had his eagle eye on Lange
lie offered him $2500 for the season, well
knowing "Bill" would Drove an exception
al drawing card. Comi?ky wanted Lange
to play with the Chicago American
I^eapue. but Lange paid no. A. H. Soden,
manager of the Boston team, would no
doubt be willing to give Lange $0000 for
his valuable services, but the big fellow,
much as he would like to be in harness
again, remembers hl3 promise to his w'fa
and his growing business, shakes his hea I
and refuses all offers.

The substitution of Oscar Gardiner for Â¦
Sullivan has been the chief .topic of dis
cupsion in local circles duriEg the past j
week. Many of the rinprgoers appear to I
be dissatisfied with the selection of Gardi
ner. They look upon him as a "has been,"
whose hands have given out. It is true,
they easy, Oscar pave Terry a hard fight
and actually knocked down the Brooklyn
Â¦whirl wind, but this was some years apo.
Since then Gardiner has been frequently
defeated "by men who have never figured
as chp_m vlonship possibilities. The local
Tir.cxoers .aj-jrue that Os=car will be an easy
mark for Tern', and the public will there
fore hav<Â» .little chance of judging the
champion'** ability as a fighter.

The directors of the Sausallto Golf Club
recently sent out a circular to the mem
bers, in which they request them either
to loan sums of money to the club for the
purpose of erecting a club house, or to
buy lockers at r cost of $10 each. The re
plies received have been satisfactory, and
it is hoped that the erection of a small
club house on the Fort Baker links will
soon be a fact.
Major General Shafter. at the request
of Major T. W. M. Draper, some time ago
pranted an unprecedented privilege to the
Sausalito Golf Club, issuing an order per
mitting the erection of a club house on a
militarv reservation. The course Is In
splendfd condition at the present time, ex
cept that a few marshy spots have not yet
dried out sufficiently to allow the long
grass being cut. As soon as the fair green
is in a condition to be cropped short the
San Rafael Golf Club will be invited to
play the return match against the team
of six Sausalito players, who were beaten
on the San Rafael links recently. The
directors of the Sausalito Golf Club have
wisely given up the Idea of raising money
by means of a fair, thinking that the get
ting up of such an enterprise would be
troublesome and costly and might result
in leaving a deficit Instead of the desired
surplus. The construction of the barracks
for the soldiers quartered at Fort Baker
has necessitated changing the position of
three or four of the putting greens, but
this has been done without detriment to
the course.
John B. Miller of the Pasadena Country
Club, president of the Southern California
Golf Association, was recently in San
Francisco, and took a leading part In the
discussion regarding the formation of a
Pacific Coast Golf Association, to com
prise the associations of Northern Cali
fornia. Southern California and the
Northwest. The association of Northern
California will include three or four of the
club3 near San Francisco. That of South
ern California has seven associate and five
allied clubs, and the Northwestern Asso
ciation comprises the most Important
clubs in Portland. Tacoma. Seattle and
Victoria. By-laws and a constitution have
been drafted, and it is proposed that the
governing body shall consist of nine mem
bersâthree from each association.
It is the opinion rt many of the San
Francisco golfers that Tacoma. Portland
and Victoria are too far away for any ef
fective conjunction with California, and
that it would be better to be content with
a California Golf Association, comprising
the associations of the northern and
southern parts of the State. There is
good reason, however,' to believe that,
while an association of some kind will
undoubtedly be formed, the arrangements
have not yet been fully made.

COLLEGE TRACK AND FIELD NOISY
WITH THE SHOUTS OF THE ATHLETES
BERKELEY, March 13.â The big
EQuad of track men at the Uni
versity of California has been
out at hard practice during the
past week. An occasional lessen
ing: of a iron's record by a second or two
cr the adding of an Inch to It has kept
vp full Interest In the work. The weath
er hns been splendid for practice.
Check, the freshman, who made nine
teen points for his class during the recent
f.eJd cay vrith the sophomores, has
dropped the broad Jump and may drop
the high Jump. He Is confining himself
to the hurdles and promises to make a
F-R-lft man in both the high and low
events. Cafiogan ought to do the 100-yard
cath in ID seconds before the close of the
eeason. His record last Saturday of 10 1-5
seconds after euch short practice makes
this extremely possible. He has tied
Drum's record of 23 fiat In the 220.
Service Btill leads In the distances.
Bailey is doing better work than before
and is crawling up on Service's records.
Clifford, although a good man, has hardly
come up to expectations. He Is running
next to Bailey.
Trainer Christie expects to make a rec
ord-breaking sprinter out of Brown, the
fresuman. His unusual speed has brought
him suddenly into prominence. He la a"
strong runner and will prove good varsity,
material. His record for the hundred is
10 2-5.
No new men have been developed for
the 440. Howard Squires Is running in his
old form In that event. He Is able to go
in 53 seconds after a few weeks' work.
His physical condition is excellent.
Delashmutt Is doing good work in the
mile walk and will keep Track Captain
Walsh moving for flrsÂ£ place in that
event. The pole vaulters are still weak.
If Duden should concentrate himself on
that particular . event he would achieve
good results, but bo far he has proved
too good an all round man to become a
record-smashing specialist. Starr and
Wilcox, the new men, have not worked
the bar up much during repent practice.
Powell is leading in the high Jump and
the low hurdles. Woolsey Is no longer in
training for the latter event and will
probably not compete In the Intercollegi
ate meet. Hamlln has commenced traln-
Ing. He and Thomas of the dental col
lege should handle the high hurdles and
Cheek and Powell the low. Thomas has a
record of 16 1-5 seconds In the 120 hurdles.
Cooley'and Cheek are both competing
with Powell for the high jump. Cooley
holds a record of 5 feet 9}Â£ Inches, but he
has been unable to do more than 5 feet 8
Inches this season.
Hussey will probably do 22 feet In the
broad Jump. Topham, a dental college
man, can do over 21 feet. Brainard, a
Junior, but a new man on the field. Is do-
Ing 21 feet and will probably exceed that
mark.
With Woolsey out of training, the
weights are left to Plaw, the reliable, and
Vilas, the freshman.
The men on the diamond have been at
constant practice. Their positions vary
but little, and the varsity representatives
against Stanford could now be picked
without difficulty.
STANFORD TJNIVERSITT. March 15.â
The first test of Stanford's new track ma
terial will be made to-morrow morning
at the lnterdepartment field day, when all
varsity men will be barred from partici
pation that the merit of the novices may
be discovered. A large number of men
are entered, the competition between the
law, geology and engineering students be
ing very keen.
In the 50, 100 and 220 yard dashes Ham
ilton, Dunn and Lamb will 'compete.
These three races promise to be the fea
tures of the day. The long-dlstancs men
chances that the men will nulab. In the
order named. .
Although the baseball men have been
practicing hard through the week, they
have showed no better form. *Â»*!"*â¢
they seem to be In the midst of a very bad
slump. The cause Is attributed to a lack
of ginger, a suggestion Â°* Â¦**"* J^f*;
which gives the players while on the <Ha
mond a don't-care-who-wins appearance.
With two or three Exceptions the suck
work Is below the ordinary. Dr. Murphy
would sacrifice any other feature of the
game If he could develop his colts In this
line, but so far his efforts have been un
availing. The team has been further
weakened by the loss of Guy Connor at
third base. Connor was a. anre n eider, a
rood hitter and always In the- game. His
departure will bring Brown In from kf.
field and leave Horn. Syciond3 and Craw
ford to scramble for the outfield vacancy.
Bennett and Parker lead among the can
didates for pitcher, but neither has
proved a puzzle for a good batter, thouff.i

term some" brilliant playing may be ex
pected. ::â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ .
The make-up of the teams was as fol
lows:
a largo gathering of society people, and
many dainty toilets were displayed.
It was about 3:30 o'clock that game was
called. The usual six periods of ten min
utes in a championship game were fol
lowed. The Incentives were silver cups as
trophies, donated by J. D. Grant, to go to
the members of the winning team, and
numerous wagers between the Individual
members.
Charles Wheeler of Philadelphia, a
member of the polo team of that city, and
also of the Hurlingnam Club, was the ref
eree. "Dick" Tobln was the umpire and
Buckley Johnson the scorekeeper and ref
eree. Dick Tobin had a bet with Menzies
of the Hurlingham team and wished to
withdraw from the position of umpire.
As only in one Instance was any question
raised the visitors insisted that he re
main in the saddle. His decision was on
an "offside" play and a question of goal,
in which all at once acquiesced that he
was right.
When Walter Hobart with a back-hand
stroke, followed by Joe Tobln with a long
drive across the field and Driscoll follow
ing, made the first goal the California con
tingent was duly elated. The visitors
were not discouraged, and after a few
moments' rest put. the ball again In play.
Menzies of Hurlingham fought with Ho
bart. while Mackey and Driscoll kept onÂ©
another out of the play. Tobln, after a
long and daring ride, drove the ball home,
making the score 2 to 0 for Burllngame.

MURLINGHAM'S pet polo team,
mounted on Texan and Santa
Barbara ponies, went down to
glorious defeat In Burlingame's
field yesterday before the Burlln
game Club's corps of ball-smashers. The
score was 6 to 4. As the tide of battle
flowed from one end of the field to the
other the spectators, gathered in honor of
the occasion, ripped white kid gloves in
hand applause, or waved their ready caps
high In air at some dashing stroke or dar
ing feat of horsemanship.
It was a gala day for Burllngame and
the California players. For, far out from
the land where polo reigns supreme, fresh
from victories In France and Spain, with
the trophies of England' at the end of
their polo mallets, had come these merry
men from England.
Two of them, the McCreerys, Lawrence
and Walter, who were once of this city,
but now claim England as their home, did
their work with great vigor. They ably
aided F. G. Menzies and F. J. Mackey
with all the finesse gained while earning
the reputation of being the finest "backs"
and greatest exponents of the game on
two continents. They were here, there
and away again all the time, but their
dashing plays, desperate riding and pow
erful strokes availed naught.
The red-jacketed "demons" of the Bur
llngame Club were at their heel3 or In
front of them all the time. Walter Ho
bart, Joe Tobln, Charles Dunphy and
Thomas A. Driscoll formed the invincible
quartet that conquered. Driscoll, al
though weak from a recent attack of the
grip, rode out the game. One of Dunphy's
ponies broke a tendon In Its leg In the
first period, but was kept on the field until
another mount could be secured.
Society Out in Force.
Every element conduced to the success
of the game. As a special concession the
Monterey express brought the city contin
gent to the field, stopping at Burllngame
to land the expected visitors. Marquees
were erected on the field, while coaches,
tally-hos, drags, dog-carts, flies and ve
hicles of all other descriptions surrounded
the field. From these polnta of vantage
the fair occupants beamed smiles of ap
proval on victor and vanquished alike.

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
The contest between Young Snailham
and Young McFaaden was the star event
on the profrramme presented last night by
the Bay City Athletic Club. It was Snail
ham's second appearance In the ring and
for a beginner he made a very clever
showing. At the end of the fourth rounl
the judges believed the youngsters so
evenly matthed that they ordered another
round. After it had been fought they de
clared the contest a draw. Tho decision
should have cone to Snailham.
The battle between Kid Corin and Jerry
Mitchell was a lively one from start to
finish. Mitchell was given the decision.
George Doherty, who was matched to
box four rounds with Ed TUlson, threw
up his contract in the first round. Ono
punch in the ribs caused him to seek tho
lioor. He kicked his heels up In the air.
closed his eyes and comfortably awalte-1
being counted out. When he was declared
"out'' he quickly "regained conscious
ness" and hopped out of the ring evident
ly well satisiled that he had not sustained
more serious damage.
Frank Dillon also suffered from a severe
attack of "heart failure." In the second
round he put on a look of distress and was
seeking- a soft spot to drop on, when Po
lice Sergeant Helms came to his rescue by
ordering the contest stopped. Jack Mc-
Cormick, his antagonist, retired looking
very disgusted.
Frank Neal. who is a likely youngster,
was booked to face Spike Wallace four
rounds. Spike was suffering from cold
feet and declined to appear. George
White, who some time ago fought a draw
with Neal, jumped in to fill the vacancy.
He lasted less than one minute. An up
percut on the Jaw, quickly followed by a
swinging right on the neck, sent- him to
the floor unconscious. ;He was some little
time in coming to.
Jack McGinnis and Tody Everett fought
a four round draw., McGinnis would have
been counted out In the third round but
for the timely sounding of the gong.
Cyclone Kelly and Joe Long fought four
interesting ' rounds. Â¦ The decision . was
given to Kelly on his merits.
Jack McCarthy and Bobby Otts slugged
and pummeled each other for four rounds.
The judges awarded the fight to McCarthy
and a storm of hisses followed.
Snailham Proves to
Be a PUgilist of
Unusual Ability.
SOME GOOD
BOXING BY
AMATEURS
The rundown of the regular weekly
stake was held yesterday at Union Cours
ing Park. Of the forty-eight courses run
favorites captured all but nine, although
the short enders landed at better than
average odds. Hares were stronger than
expected for this time of year and as a
result the scores figured higher than for
some stakes past.
Warship is stake favorite and looks a
eood selection. Bona Fide, Risky Attempt
and Honor Bright, In the first half, with
the first mentioned as choice, and Liber
ator, Santonin and Olita, in the second
half, with the latter in favor, are har 1
to beat.
A strong tip has gone out on Jlmmle
Anthony tor stake winner. The doe has"
been doing 'great work in Vallejo and is
a good stayer. In fact the Courser, lm
proves as he goes along In a stake. To
morrow he will have America for his .op
ponent and it is not likely that he can
take the flag from him. If, however; he
scores a victory he has a good chance
for the stake.
Other winners In the second round look
to be lone. I-og Boy, Urania, Tiburon,
America, Twin City Girl, Black Flush,
Loughneagh, Hot Haste, Pleasant Girl,
Rona, Saia, St. Ives, Miss Wilson, Dew-
Orep, Random Aim, Achilles.
In addition to tne iinals of the open
stake a slxteen-dog Champion event will
be run oft' to-morrow. Ireland, on the 17th
of March last, quite naturally won the
stake. Barring hunches and superstition
Geary's ciog figures . favorite for - this
event. In the rundown Rural Artist,
Floodgate, Palo Alto, Chicago Boy, Mose,
Ireland. Little Sister and Sisquoc shouid
have their colors hoisted.

WICHITA, Kans., March 15.-Mre. Na

ate a city ticket- One of the leaders ex
pressed his belief that they should not
enter politics at this time, and somebody

WA&HINGTOX, March 15.â The Com
missioner of Patents, Charles H. Duell,
to-day tendered to the President his res
ignation, to take effect on the appoint

There are several candidates in the field
for the office, and it is thought that be
fore the end of the present month a new
Commissioner will be appointed.
Patent Commissioner Resigns.
Over at Oakland track this afternoon
turf-goers will witness a renewal of tne
historic Thornton stake at four miles. In
the past no event on '.he California racing
calendar ever aroused such general in
terest as this contest of speed and endur
ance. It is a race over a distance that
can be witnessed but once a year, and a
groat crowd will cross the bay.
The San Francisco Jockey Club offers
the Derby as a special attraction on th*
reopening of Ingleside. As the three
year-olds named to start have met on for
mer occasions it is needless to enumerate
their good or bad Qualities. Tod Sloan
will again ride Joe Frey, which fact alone
should prove a strong drawing card.
Track Notes.
In the sixth race Toah forged to thÂ»
front after everybody had conceded the
race to Alzura. with Burns doing the
piloting. Alzura was in the lead all the
way unitl the paddocK. Then O'Connor
shot out and at the wire led BurÂ»i3'
mount. Seide got the place.
Dominlck, on E. M. Brattain, took first
money in the maiden two-year-old race
over three furlongs. Brattain opened on
the boards at 20-1. but the play lowered
the odds to 7-1 when the trumpet sounded
the post call. Ogle, with Thorpe up, fig
ured In the raca and after a good sta.t
looked to win. but Dominick gave a gooi
strong ride down the stretch and came
under the wire flret. Lculette, the favor-
He. got the show.
The maiden threc-v.ar-old fillies event
over five furlongs wa3 won by Cushion,
with See up. Katherine Ennis, Thorpe
doing the steering, was the favorite, and
led until the paddock, when Cushion
passed in under the wire bv a neck. Mis.
I3runnell got the show all three of th?
money-getters working under a driving
finish.
Winnie O'Connor on St. Cuthbert won
the fourth race In easy fashion. Hermoso.
an even-money favorite and yllotcd lÂ»y
Dominlck, led until the stretch, when St.
Cuthbert took first place and won out by
two lengths. Kitty Kelly got the show.
Tommy Burns carried Wyoming und;r
the wire for first monev in the fifth, a
mile race. Haviland, the favorite, led un
til the stretch, when Wyoming went up
and drum-majored the pack. Haviland
held on and got the place, Nansen falling
back for the show and Free Lance trail
ing along in the dust.
THE favorites were again hit hard
at Tanforan yesterday, but the
only startling performance was
that of E, M. Brattain. ridden by
Dominick. Brattain scored at 20
to 1. Alee, the second choice, with Thorpe
up, gave Prejudice a livelv chase in the
first race, over six and a half furlons3.
Thorpe took the lead at the start and
never lost it. Racetto, ridden by O'Con
nor, got the show. The start was by no
means a good one. All three money-get
ters were driven hard at the finish.

AT TANFORAN TRACK
Atkin & Lottridge's three-year-old, Sr.
Rica, with eighty-seven pounds on ills
back, made his field in the seven furlong
handicap look cheap. Fairly well played,
he won all the way. Five lengths back
Rosormonde downed The Fretter. favorite
in the books, a length for the place.
Miss Rowena made a bid for the intro
ductory scramblei but could "not carry her
speed to the end, and Hagerdon, the
favorite, won easily. There were thirteen
starters and Nettie Clark, a 40 to 1 shot,
succeeded In taking the show.
But three lined up in the six furlons
run following. Dandy Jim enjoyed the
call at 3 to 5. and although Bernota tried
to make trouble, the favorite scored clev
erly. El Karn was beaten off.
Considerable guessing was Indulged in
over the probable winner of the mile and
a sixteenth celling affair. Norford, finally
closed favorite, but the fast track wai
not to his -liking and he could do no bet
ter than finish third. Stuart, astride the
10 to 1 shot. Spike, slipped away in the
lead and, never headed reached the wire
four lengths In advance of Rio Shannon.
Cromwell ran poorly.
That a. mistake was made in sending
Rollick to the post favorite for the mile
and fifty yard run was quite apparent be
fore the race had progressed far. Mounee
soon assumed the front position with The
Phoenician and Dr. Rowell's recent pur
chase played with the first choice, win
ning by a couple of lengths. Mitten, a well
backed outsider, ran third.
When the barrier was released Water
scratch, which runs in blinkers, was la.-:t
away. The half brother to Braw Sect
tried to run out, compelling Mounee to
rap him over the head with his whip as
the stretch, turn was rounded. Then ho
swerved toward the inner rail, eventually
finishing: third, for in a. hard drive, the
10 to 1 chance Monastic, beat Mike Mur
phy a length. The judges were not
pleased with the ride the favorite re
ceived, and Mounee was called into thÂ«
stand and questioned. The race is still
under investigation.
After Hagerdon and Dandy Jim, fir^t
choices In the ring, had sauntered home
before their iields, the favorites played a
hard luck inning, falling to score again.
The attendance was up to the average and
the sport enjoyable In every particular.
WHILE riders like O'Connor.
Burns and Henry can get
beaten on short priced horses
In ridiculously slow time, one
portion of the public appar
ently thinks that Master Owen Mouncc,
now apparlnc In the saddle at Oakland
track, is infallible. Unless the Idaho boy
lands every one of his mounts across (he
line first a despairing wail is heard from
the horse's supporters that ' he "was
pulled." Not so many moons ago,' when
Mounee was riding for Walter Jennings
and that turfman's horses were in tiptop
condition, Mounee was looked upon as a
very promising novice, which he was. The
boy at present is riding as a free lance
and accepts mounts at random. Some of
the horses he pitches the leg over are fit,
some are not. If his bad looking efforts
set down as mistakes are not mistakes
then he should mend his ways, for a brll Â¦
liant future and many thousands of dol
lars are In sight for the youth from Idaho.
Yes(erday Mounee had the mount on
Waterscratch, installed a 1 to 2 chance

looked very short, especially as _vtik<;

A man in Indiana sold his wife for $2. After the

the judgment of an ordinary Justice of the Peace?
The fellow who threatened the newly elected mil
lionaire Senator from Utah has opened up the pros
pect of an avenue of crime that would cause a division
of sentiment among even the most law abiding peo
ple in the country.' Suppose several conspicuous Sen
ators, who need not be named, were abducted and car
ried into retirement, would anybody howl? Would
the country vote a ransom?
Among other regalia there has just been presented
to, King Edward by the Australian Federation an
opal which is said to be the largest and finest in th
world. It is described as being two inches long, an
inch and a half thick, weighs 250 karats, and is esti
mated to be worth $250,000. It will be remembered
that opals are said to bring bad luck, but neither Ed
ward nor any one else would hesitate to take risks
on an opal of that value.
So, finally, there was little opposition to the admis
sion of Utah under the anti-polygamy guarantee re
quired by Congress to be put in her State constitu
tion. That guarantee was that there should be perfect
religious toleration and that polygamy, or plural mar
riage should be forever prohibited, and when it was
put in her constitution Utah walked into the Union
the equal of the oldest State and the complete mistress
of the legislation by which her constitution should
be made vital and find enforcement.
The Tucker-Edmunds law applied only to the Ter
ritory and fell by automatic repeal when the Mormons
entered the Union. Since then they have been appar
ently acquiescent in the guarantee of the constitution,
though it has been more than suspected that under
this superficial assent the flesh and the spirit were
again in unison in the secret revival of polygamy as
a part of their scheme of salvation. '
Within a few days the mask has been, discarded.
The present Legislature has a large Mormon major
ity. The Evans bill, which Governor, Weils has ve
toed, is professedly, to enforce the anti-polygamy
guarantee, but in reality to entirely nullify it. The
The penitent always commands sympathy, that great
undoer of precaution. Mormons of age and dignity,
of highly cultivated talents, who had made lasting
friendships as delegates of the Territory in Congress,
and others, whose business relations had brought them
into favorable contact with the Gentile world, had
suffered indictment, and manfully â¢ pleaded guilty to
polygamous marriage, and in court had powerfully and
pitifully defended the virtue of their wives and the
legitimacy of their children. When the denunciation
of the criminal law and the renunciation of the church
were at one these men had selected each a wife from
the many they had and made ample provision for the
abandoned, and by these courses had file.d a genuine
claim to Gentile respect and confidence.
But the church, admonished by the stern enforce
ment of the law and by the adverse public opinion of
the country, professedly cast off the offensive practice
and ceased to follow it, either as a domestic regulation
or a means of spiritual grace. After this act of self
abnegation and reform from the inside in response to
pressure from without, Utah presented herself as a
reformed and repentant Magdalen, asking admission
as an equal to the sisterhood of States.
The admission of Utah as a State was deferred
until she had long passed in population the num
ber that had been considered necessary to state
hood in the case of other Territories. Had not the
Tucker-Edmunds law against polygamy passed, to be
followed by the formal abandonment of plural mar
riage by the apostolic authority of the Mormon
church, Utah would still be a Territory, with the firm
hand of the Federal power filling her prisons with
the male parties to polygamous marriage.
GOVERNOR WELLS of Utah has acted wisely
in vetoing the Evans bill relating to com
plaints in criminal prosecutions. The issue is
of interest to the whole country, and deserves more
than a passing notice.
POLYGAMY REVIVED.
This is not good eccnomics. Existing systems pay
taxes into the public treasury, and if obsoleted with
out compensation to the capital they represent it
dies where it is and tan no longer respond in taxa
tion.
In every case within our knowledge in the British
Isles both water works and street railways were
taken and paid for, thus keeping alive the capital they
represented. Otherwise the taxpayer has upon him
the burden of interest on the bond issue, and also is
compelled to make good the tax lost upon the capi
tal destroyed ic the old works.
Another matter must not be lost sight of. It is too
frequently the case in this country that municipal
ownership is advocated from motives of revenge or a
desire to injure invested capital. We recall no in
stance in which it has been proposed to take 'over
existing water and street railway systems at* a fair
valuation, in order not to inflict the loss of the pri
vate capital they represent. But almost without ex
ception it is proposed to issue bonds for the installa
tion of new works.
In discussing the subject there has reappeared, in a
number of American newspapers, a former error
about Glasgow, in the assertion that that city derives
from the profits of her water supply and operation of
the street railways a sum that supports her entire
government and releases the people from taxation.
As we have heretofore shown by the direct testimon3'
of the Glasgow municipal reports, that is not so The
taxation in that city is appreciably higher than in San
Francisco and Oakland.
Therefore it will be seen that there must be a dom
inating diversity of conditions, and it would be very
unwise for the Birmingham ratepayer to assume a
similarity and rail at his municipal water supply be
cause it is not as cheap as that of San Francisco fur
nished by a corporation.
The Birmingham water supply is abundant and
good. It*is gathered in the Welsh hills and the ar
rangement for its distribution is ample and eco
nomical, and its administration free from scandal, but
it costs the consumer more than the Spring Valley s
supply to San Francisco.
Already the American papers which promote this
theory, referring to what London proposes, point to
what Birmingham and Glasgow have accomplished.
In order, however, to secure similar results there must
be similar conditions, and conditions must be closely
examined, lest a plan workable in one place may
prove unsuited to another by reason of an irrecon
cilable diversity.-
Already, however, the American s6cialists and com
munists, and those who are neither, but who from
various motives desire to put business duties and re
sponsibilities upon government, are using the senti
ment expressed by ballot in London to propagate a
similar condition in ibis country. The feeling in fa
vor of municipal ownership has long been cherished
in the United States, but has never gained any im
petus from examples of that policy in this countiy.
City ownership of water supply in Boston, New York
and Philadelphia has existed from the early appear
ance of the necessity for a large supply in those cities.
But'apparenth' neither in the quality of the supply
furnished nor in the economy of its storage, conduit
and distribution has it afforded a quotable example.
So the earnest advocates of the system resort to
foreign instances of its institution.
MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP
THE advocates of municipal ownership of public
service industries are getting much encourage
ment out of the recent election of the London
Town Council. The majority of that legislative body
cf the English capital was pledged to effect municipal
ownership of the water and light supply and of street
railroads. While the Town Council is the ruling
body, the great body cf the city is subject to political
corporations, existing by royal grant and holding
chartered rights. Before all London can be brought
to a common policy as to the public service industries
these separative corporations must be brought intc
line with the Town Council. .This will be a work ot
lime, so that none may expect an immediate object
lesson to be furnished by the center of the Anglo-
Saxon world.

CAUFOBinAU'S IN WASHINGTON"
ZZjFFORTS now being made by Pennsylvania to
induce the various State Legislatures to call for
* â * a national convention for the purpose of so
amending the Federal constitution as to provide for
the election of United States Senators by direct vote
of the people may possibly fail, but, if so, the failure
will be due to objections to that method of making
the amendment and not to the amendment itself.
That much is made certain by the fact that in recent
years a large number of States have through their
Legislatures declared in favor of abolishing the pres
ent system of Senatorial elections, and among the
States that have so declared are some of the most con
scrvative in the Union. .
The issue is as yet z. non-partisan one and will
doubtless remain -so, but still it is worth noting that
Republican States have been among the leaders in the
demand for the amendment. Among the States whose
Legislatures have at one time or another urged the
amendment are Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michi
gan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Oregon, Kan
sas, Nebraska and Washington. The new States of
Wyoming, Utah and North Dakota have also de
clared for it. Texas is, we believe, the only South
ern State that has thus far demanded the change, but
in a majority of those States popular elections are
very nearly a dead letter, and consequently an agita
tion of the question in that section is hardly to be
expected. Should the issue be presented to them as
one of practical politics their Legislatures would in
all probability vote as the Democratic national plat
form dictates, and therefore they may be counted as
reasonably sure to favor the change.
The drift of popular sentiment on the subject is not
the result of any temporary breeze of politics. Thi
sentiment, in fact, has been one of slow but' con
tinuous growth. For a long series of years the coun
try has been disturbed by scandal after scandal in the
election of United States Senators. It is hardly ne
cessary to go over the dreary record. It suffices to
say that so far from any improvement resulting from
the exposure of the earlier scandals, affairs have be
come steadily worse, until now two States of the
Union are without representatives in the Senate, and
several of them have representatives whose elections
are known to a moral certainty to have been brought
about by every form of corruption that the cunning
and the fraud of unscrupulous men can devise.
Up to this time there have been twenty-seven States
in all that have decla-ed for election by direct vote of
the people. Should rll of them indorse the Penn
sylvania plan there would be required but three more
to make up the two-thirds necessary to carry tha
amendment. That plan, however, is so radically dif
ferent from the method urged by the States on for
mer occasions that it is by no means certain all oi
them will support it. Men may be in favor of an
amendment brought about through the action of Con
gress and State Legislatures who would not be in
favor of a national convention to deal with the sub
ject. That fact gives a new interest to a movement
which would otherwise attract comparatively little at
tention, and renders the result by no means a fore
gone conclusion. Enough in the way of approval
has, however, already been gained to raise the Penn
sylvania plan to the rank of a live political issue, and
since it appears to be ilie only feasible means of bring
ing about the reform it may attain success much more
speedily than many people imagine.

The peculiar value of the civil service
system of examinations consists in the
fact that it endeavors to determine the
relative fitness or merit of the various
competitors â¢ for the particular positions
they seek. All political, religious and per
sonal preferences are entirely excluded hi
determining the character of suitable ex
aminations and in rating the papers of
competitors. In the great majority of
cases. the identity of those who compete
is not disclosed to the examiners until
the papers have been rated, thus insuring
absolute fairness in this feature of the
work. It is difficult, however, to. convince
the average applicant who ls seeking em
ployment under the Government that it is
not necessary to secure the aid of sotiie
presumably influential citizen to secure
full Information In regard to the require
ments of civil service examinations, or to
have his examination papers property
rated and certified. '
i This Impression, which ls entirely Â¦â¢ false
'nnd unfounded. the~commisslon has sought
to overcome, on every occasion. Absolute
impartiality anÂ«l justice to all are the fun
damental requirements of the civil ser
vice act and rules, and every citizen, no
matter how humble his station, is entitled
to every right and privilege which may be
accorded to the most prominent and in
fluential. This fact makes the civil ser
vice system Â¦ absolutely democratic in ev
ery essential and not aristocratic, as some
of Its enemies have claimed. It throws
open wide to every American citizen the
doors of opportunity and says: "He who
shall best demonstrate his fitness to serve
his country In a civil capacity shall be ap
pointed to public office, and shall be re
tained so long ns he renders faithful and
efficient .'service."
How to Get Preliminary Information.
: The first stop, then, in taking a", civil
service examination is not to seek the as
sistance of your, member of Congress or
your Senator or any other presumably in
fluential person to put you on a proper
footing with the civil service commission,
but ; to communicate directly with the
commission at Washington or with any of
Its recognized agencies. Its" local boardsof

Many Kinds of Examinations.
The examinations required to test fit
ness for employment in the public service
are as varied as the nature of the posi
tions themselves. During the last liscal
year the Civil Service Commission gave
examinations under not less than 4S3 dif
ferent titles, and of this number fully 100
were entirely new, not having been given
before. The field of knowledge, manual
skill and scientific attainment covered by
the commission's examinations is wider
and far more Intricate than that covered
by the curriculum of any university, for
it embraces not only the requirements of
all the learned professions, except that
of theology, but in addition to them the
vast range of scientific attainments nec
essary to carry on much of the original
work of the great executive departments
and scientific bureaus of the Government.
It is also necessary to furnish in the
classified service a large force of well
equipped, practical men qualified to carry
on the many important engineering and
building operations which are undertaken
at the public expense. Many positions in
the engineer and ! ordnance departments
at large fall into this category, as well
as superintendents of construction and
architectural draughtsmen under the su
pervising architect's office. There are
also thousands of clerical and subordinate
positions In the executive departments In
Washington requiring, in many cases, in
addition to simple clerical ability, skill as
stenographers, typewriters, bookkeepers,
Hnculsts. computers and draughtsmen.
Following these is the large number of
positions In the custom-house service,
many of which require expert examiners
of all classes of merchandise or goods, as
well as competent clerk* and accountants.
Positions Filled by the Commission.
The railway mail service, with over 8030
employes, traversing every State and
nearly every Territory of the nation, re
quires the services of young men of phy
sical vigor, good memories and fair com
mon school education. The classified
postofflce service, comprising all the fre.Â»
delivery postoffices of the country, over
S50 in number, and employing over 37,000
clerks and carriers. Imposes similar re
quirements to those for the railway ma'l
service, and constitutes the largest single
class of positions in the classified civil ser
vice. Positions In the Internal revenue ser
vice, with the exception of deputy collec
tors and storekeepers and gaugers whose
average pay is less than $3 a day or $500
a year, are also included In the classified
service and are subject to competitive ex
amination. Many - of these positions re
quire familiarity with revenue laws and
of the methods of manufacture, gauging
and storing spirituous and malt liquor?.
Tho Government printing service at
Washington comprises the employes
(nearly 3000 in number) in the largest
rrinting office in the world. All the trades
and occupations of the printing business
are represented, and qualifications are
tested by competitive examination. Th-Â»
Indian service, including the superintend
ents, teachers and many of the other em
ployes of the various Indian schools
throughout the country, is also embraced
in the classified service and demands at
tainments of the most varied character.
In addition to the services already
enumerated, the following also have many
positions subject to competitive examina
tion and requiring special technical an.l
peculiar qualifications in many cases: The
marine hospital service, the lighthouse
service, the life-saving service, the several
mints and assay offices, the revenue cut
ter service, the force employed under the
custodians of public buildings, the several
sub-treasuries.
There are also numerous other position
in the classified civil service not here
enumerated for which special technical or
clerical ability Is required.
Merit Is the Only Test. Â£Â£'
For carrying on its marvelously Intri
cate and varied work the commission not
only has a corps of trained examiners on
its own force, but is authorized to call to
its aid In preparing and rating examina
tions many experts In the public service
outside its own office who are especially
qualified in scientific, professional or tech
nical subjects.
The fact that there are over 80,000 posi
tions in the classified civil service of the
United States at the present time which
are filled as the result of competitive ex
aminations lends interest to the mode of
taking them. Every, year nearly 50,000 ap
plicants compete in examinations to test
their fitness for public employment, and
of this number nearly 10,000, or approxi
mately one-fifth of all examined, secure
appointment. Of those examined about
75 per cent are successful In securing rat
ings" which make them eligible for ap
pointment, while the remainder fail.
The positions for which the examina
tions are held are located throughout the
United States and are of the most varied
character, ranging from that of carpenter
or blacksmith at an Indian agency to
that of supervising architect of the
Treasury Department or assistant eth
nologist of the Smithsonian Institution.
The salaries also vary greatly, ranging
from a minimum of about $300 or $400 a
year for some positions of the lowest
grade, such as skilled laborers and
messenger boys, to from $2000 to $4000 a
year for a few positions requiring spe
cial professional or scientific attainments
and great executive ability. The salaries
for much the larger proportion of the po
sitions, however, range from 1600 or >8tX>
to $1600 or $1800 a year, appointments
usually being made at the lower salaries
and promotion made to the higher posi
tions on the basis of experience and effi
ciency in the service.

V.â HOW TO TAKE A CIVIL SEBVICE EXAMINATION.
make inquiries of the appropriate local
board already mentioned for the neces
sary information as to the scope, char
acter and dates of examinations, appli
cation forms, etc. If. however, you seek
information in relation to the department
al service In Washington or the railway
mall. Government printing, Indian or oth
er important branches of the service not
local, you should make inquiry of the
civil service commission at Washington,
D. C. A printed "Manual of Examina
tions," giving full and complete Informa
tion respecting the scope and character
of all the more important examinations. Is
furnished on request without cost to all
applicants. Having leceived this manual
and read it carefully you should determine
upon the kind cf examination you desire
to take, being governed In this choice by
your own qualifications and the needs of
the public service or the classes of eligl
bles most in demand. In this connection
It may be stated that the demand for sim
ple clerical ability which has not been
specialized in some way is relatively small
at the present time. For instance, very
few persons are appointed from the de
partmental clerk register, while a much
larger number is appointed from the reg
ister of qualified stenographers and type
writers.
Specialists in Public Service.
The more highly specialized your quali
fications, if they are of a character de
sired in the Government service, the
greater your prospects of appointment if
you pass an examination. For illustra
tion, the commission frequently has diffi
culty in securing a sufficient number of
well-qualified civil and electrical engl-
neers, topographic and other classes of
skilled draughtsmen to supply the needs
of the service, while It has excessively
large registers of clerks, messengers,
watchmen and skilled laborers.
It was formerly the policy of the de
partment to appoint many more persons
to the grade of clerk or copyist than at
the present tlmo, and to train up from
that grade those specialists required In
the performance of many classes of cler
ical work. Now It Is the desire of these
departments to secure as far as possible
persons who possess the necessary quali
fications for the performance of these
special classes of work without requiring
to be trained after appointment. This
practice greatly increases the number of
different kinds of examinations held and
encourages those possessed of the de
sired qualifications to enter them. Many
of these special examinations are not In
cluded In the "Manual of Examinations,"
but are announced and held from time to
time as the need for them arises In con
sequence of vacancies in the departments.
These special examinations for particu
lar vacancies or classes of vacancies are
usually announced through the press at
least thirty days before being held. The
commission also keeps lists of -the names
of persons who wish to be informed of
the announcements of examinations of a
certain character, and such persons are
advised if an examination of the kind
they desire to enter is about to be held.
Preparing for an Examination.
Having received such Information as
you desire, and having selected the exam
ination you wish to take, the proper ap
plication form should be carefully exe
cuted, observing fully all the require
ments of the form, and should be filed
either with the local board of examiners
or the commission at Washington, as may
bo required. This is a very important
step in the taking of an examination, as
errors in the tilling out of application pa
pers often result in serious delays and
great annoyance both to the commission
and the applicant.
After having filed your application you
should give close attention to the scope
of the subjects of the examination you
nave selected In order that you may fa
miliarize yourself as far as possible with
the requirements of the position you seek.
You will observe that In examinations of
a clerical nature, such' as those for de
partmental clerk, postofflce clerk and cus
tom-house clerk, for example, the ques
tions are largely of a practical or busi
nesslike character, and are designed to
test your clerical ability rather than mere
theoretical knowledge of textbooks. Tho
problems in artithmetic in these examina
tions are usually along the lines of prac
tical business, or involve such principles
as are In daily use in clerW work for
business firms or private corporations.
The other tests of thls^-class of examin
ations, such as the subjects of letter writ
ing and copying, are designed to be prac
tical and businesslike, and are Intended
to determine your real capacity for cler
ical work rather than your mere schol
astic acquirements. You will find It will
be of assistance to you to study carefully
the rules for marking the different sub
jects of the examination. These are pub
lished In the "Manual of Examinations"
already mentioned. By noting the classes
of errors for which specific charges are
made under this system of marking you
will be able to avoid many of them.
Taking an Examination.
On the day of the examination you
should. If possible, arrive early at the
rooms where the examination is held. In
order to avoid any feeling of nervousness
or discomfort from a sense of being hur
ried. If possible, get a good night's rest
before the examination. This Is much
more Important than to spend the time
in an endeavor to study or make special
preparation for the examination at that
late date. Having entered upon the ex
amination, carefully plan the disposition
of your time so as to give sufficient time
to the more important subjects. As a.
rule, ample time is allowed in all of the
commission's examinations for the aver
age competitor to complete his work with
out being especially hurried.
If you are examined in the same room
or at the same tables with other com
petitors It Is very important that you se
cure the absolute Integrity of your own
work. In order to do this you should use
every possible means to prevent any fel
low competitors from observing vour
work or obtaining any Information from
y Â£ ur ,S*V: ets ' an 3 U ls needless to sav you
should be equally careful in not attempt
ing to secure assistance from others It
not infrequently occurs that the examina
tion papers of competitors are canceled
and they are barred from future examina
tions, because of failure to observe these
requirements. . "* c Uleao
~ n receiving: the examination sheets

Panted on them for your information You
Â£tiiii h â¢?it en ?& led tO P rocee <* much more
intelligently with your work and will not
feel disposed tp make any inquiries of the
exam ner in charge. Be sure that all thl
examination sheets belonging to your ex
amination are issued to you. and that you
Â»Enft co â¢P Iet ed them to the best of your
ability before turning them over to the
examiner And. finally, having completed
your work, do not become Impatient if
you do not promptly receive a notice of
your averages. It frequently occurs that
because of its limited force of examiners
the work of the commission ls from two
to four months in arrears, and the needs
of the service rather than the personal
desires of the competitors determine the
order in^whlch the examination shall be
rated. ' You may feel assured, however
that your papers will be rated just aa
promptly as It is possible for the commis
sion to do so. and that Just as soon as
they are completed you will be adviÂ«ed of
your ratings, whether you have passed or
failed to pass.
How Appointments Are Mc.de.

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
The remedy lies in an amendment to the Federal
constitution forbidding polygamy as it forbids slavery,
and putting its enforcement in the hands of the Fed
eral courts. We "have heretofore advised such an
amendment, and urge it now, for Mormon influence:
may soon corrupt the statutes of Idaho and Wyoming,
and the harem will become a fixed domestic institu
tion in the three States.
The bill has been plausibly defended with that
seeing hypocrisy and keen ingenuity which are always
at the command of ecclesiastical tyranny. In a ma
jority of the States the statute of adultery provides
that there shall be no prosecution except upon infor
mation filed by the wronged husband or wife. Such
a statute is intended to protect the family, which may
be destroyed by a designing outsider who for motives
of revenge might separate husband and wife by a falsr
charge against either. There is no logical, moral or
legal analogy between such a statute and the pro
polygamy law of Utah, But the church could set up a
false analogy and defend it with plausibility and power.
Such a law would reopen every harem in Utah. "Xhz
ineffable and ghostly but awful power of the church,
which reaches its busy hand into the material concerns
of its people, and passing the veil, binds or loosens is
tho spiritual world, holding them in the unbreakable
bonds of fear and superstition from the moment they
â¢are shirted in the holy robe consecrated in the mys
teries of the Temple to the moment of death and bc
yond its pain, would see to it that none of its children
complain.
bill provides that prosecutions for polygamy shall lie
only upon an information filed by a husband or wife
wronged by the act, or by a relative within the. sec
ond degree of consanguinity.
Our guests of to-day are men who have been
largely instrumental in advancing American trade and
industry until they have become the wonder of the
world, and San Francisco, looking across the Pa
cific to the rich Orient, and through the years to the
marvelous era that is to be, can hardly do too much
in the way of welcome to men whose example reveals
the way by which the possibilities of her trade with
the East and in the future are to be gloriously real
ized.
America needs the men who can begin life' With
nothing but pluck, health and brains and by the right
use of them become millionaires. She needs the men
who can exploit her mines, cultivate her fields, con
struct railroads and launch steamship lines, build up
cities, furnish work and wages "for her people and
maintain in all her veins that flourishing trade which
is the calm health of nations. Consequently when any
company composed of such men visit an American
community they are justly received with honor.
Fortunately the American people are not unappre
ciative of the merits of those who take the lead in
great enterprises. There may be here and there
heard the voice of envy or folly complaining of the
wealth that the leaders have obtained and trying to
detract from their merits, but such voices have little
influence upon the public mind. "The great mass of
the people understand the worth to a community of a
man who knows how to do business on a large scale.
They are also conscious of the truth of the saying of
Solomon that where there is an increase of substance
there is an increase of those who consume it. The
masters of industry and commerce do not work for
themselves only. Their energies and their thoughts
cannot be reserved for purely selfish ends. The struc
ture of society is so closely woven in warp and woof
that whoever legitimately and honestly advances his
own fortune advances at the same time the fortunes
of his fellow men.
Buhver has very justly made Richelieu describe
trade as "the calm health of nations," and boast with
honest pride that having found France with trade rot
ting in her markets he had caused it to pour through
all the veins of the kingdom "in strengthening tides."
The great captains of industry and the merchant
princes of the United States have each in his own way
helped to quicken these strengthening tides and to
augment them, and as a result their labors have been
for the benefit of all. It is difficult to measure the
debt which the people of the United States owe to
men who have known how to convert cheap raw ma
terial into valuable products and how to find in every
part of the globe the market that is most profitable
for them. It is certain, however, that communities
which do not possess such men remain always en
gaged in little things and provide but scant wage3
for labor and but little profits for industry.
It has been estimated that the members of the com
pany represent in the aggregate a capital of upward
of $1,000,000,000. That is an immense sum, and any
'small body of men who controlled it would be no
table in the world. With these men, however, their
capital is a minor consideration. The main point to
be borne in mind in their welcome is that they rep
resent the energy, the sagacity, the enterprise and the
success which have created not only the vast wealth
they control but the still vaster wealth which through
their efforts has been contributed in wages, salaries,
profits and earnings to the community in which they
live and work.
i â¢ OT? the members of the Chicago Commercial
I Club and their guests who are now visiting the
city San Francisco has that cordial welcome
which is given to.those in whose company we delight
and whose works we honor. We are glad to have
them with us even for the short time they purpose to
stay, and we would be still more glad should some or
all of them decide to make a home and devote to the

gies that have been so successfully applied to the

In urging the formation of a missionary

on the spot in order that the heavenly
choir might be properly proportioned.
The Focicty is known as the Presby

5n the world formed exclusively of men.
It Is a State organization. Women here
tofore have practicaily monopolized the
missionary society work. The dues of
members of the woman's missionary so

their organization twenty cents a month.

Secretary Chamberlain Promises "Lon
don Merchants That the Conditions
Will Be Improved for Commerce.
LONDON, March 3C. â An important dep
utation from the Liverpool, Manchester
and London Chambers of Commerce had
an Interview to-day with the Colonial Sec
retary, Mr. Chamberlain, on the subject of
rendering West Africa more habitable.
The delegates secured a promise that if
the Chambers of Commerce will appoint
three business men, the Government will
add a representative of the Colonial Of
fice end scientific expert and pay the ex
penses of the whole commission, the duty
of which will be to Inquire into the sani
tary conditions of West Africa- and other
matters on which depend the prosperity
of the British colonials situated in that
part of the world.
Chamberlain said he considered the mat
ter Important to all tropical colonies,
among whom the cost could be appor
tioned. He mentioned that during his five
years in office he had sanctioned the
building of over 500 miles of railroad on
the west coast of Africa,
BRITAIN WILL LOOK.
TO WESTERN AFRICA
Conservatism is very often i an aggra
vated case of scare.
but is very anxious to get ashore. Cap
tain Davis did not rvant to part' with hi:n,
however, without a quid pro quo. Talbot
was employed as a salesman with Rosen
thai, Feder & Co. about eighteen months
ago. The members of the firm spent
highly of him and say he was a gentle
manly fellow and a good salesman. After
leaving Rosenthal, Feder <fe Co. Talbot
went to the AV. H. Nolan Shoe Companv.
After leaving their employ he took up
with Baxter and both of them decided to
take a trip around the Horn to Europe.
Fearing foul play the police investigat
ed the death of Baxter yesterday. De
tective Egan went out 10 the Ditton, but
all he could learn was that the unforu
nate man was shipped as an A. B. and
the boatswain knew nothing to the con
trary until he saw Baxter climbing the
rigging. Then he -knew he had anothsr
"green hand" to break in and that did
not sweeten his temper. Talbot told the
detective that the . death of his frlenrl
made him anxious to get ashore, but ths
mate would not allow htm to go. As to
signing articles, all he could remember
was being on the water front last Thurs
day night and the next morning he awoke
in the forecastle of the Ditton. It Is ex
pected that Talbot's friends will get him
off the ship before she sails.
It Is the intention of the company to
appeal to Congress for relief and if it
falls to obtain this relief it will probably
appeal for another extension next year.
Another appeal was taken to the Sec
retary of the Interior, who was urged by
the claimants and by Senator-elect Burtor.
of Kansas. Senator Allison and Speaker
Henderson to grant longer time. The
Secretary took all the circumstances Into
consideration and decided to grant an ex
tension to April I. 1JC2, instead of to June,
1902, as the company desired.
Complaints were received at the Interior
Department of the action of the company
in fencing in public lands and running
wire fences across established trails. Com
missioner of the General Land Office Her
mann decided against the company and
was sustained by the Secretary of the
Interior. The company had the case re
opened and set up a claim that it was
rightfully In possession under an old Mex
ican grant made In 1834 to Beales and
Royuela. Commissioner Hermann decided
against them on this contention, but in
view of the large interests the company
had at stake he proposed to allow a rea
sonable time for it to vacate and sug
gested ninety days.
CALL, BUREAU. H06 G STREET. X.
W.. WASHINGTON. March 15.â Several
million acres of public domain, it is
charged, has been fenced in by a company
of cattlemen under the name of the Amer
ican Livestock Company, 'who are resist
ing every effort of the Government to
dispossess them. The land Is in New
Mexico and the brst information the Gov
ernment has been able to obtain is that
there are not less than 10.000,000 head of
cattle grazing on this range, to which, it
is alleged, its holders have not the faintest
shadow of a legal title.

CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. March 15.â Secretary
Long approved to-day the conclusion of
Rear Admiral Crownlnshleld of the
Bureau of Navigation, that "An officer
who has been advanced in numbers for
service rendered during the war with
Spain is not to be regarded as additional
to the number allowed by law in his grade
until his promotion to a higher grade than
the one in which he receives his advance
ment takes place."
R^ar Admiral Hlgelnson, the Secretary
decides, is an officer in the grade of rear
admiral from March 3, 1901, the date of
the passage of the naval appropriation law
containing the provision regarding the ad
vancement of officers. Captain E. M.
Shepard. being then at the head of the
captains' list, will be promoted, because
a vacancy has existed at the foot of the
list of rear admirals since March 3.
Captain Frank Wildes cannot be pro
moted at the same time with Captain
Bhepard, but must await a vacancy in the
list of rear admirals. lieutenant Com
mander W. B. Bayley must await a va
cancy in the list of commanders, but when
promoted he will become an additional of
ficer in his grade. In the case of Colonel
R. W. Huntingdon, the Secretary held that
he did not create an additional number.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAVAL RATINGS
ARE ADJUSTED
P"-r|-Â«^HE scarcity of sailors Is directly
I responsible for the death of o'no
I poor fellow at least. Ship captains
JJL cannot set A, B.'s to man their
vessels and in consequence they
are taking anybody the boarding master
brings them and ask no questions. As a,
result half the men that are put aboard
ships in the bay are green hands and do
not know the main yard from the cap
stan.
The British ship Dltton. Captain Davis,
has been loaded and ready for sea since
Tuesday last. Sailors were not procur
able, but a few landsmen were found
ready to listen to the glowing tales of a
life at sea told by the shipping and board
ing: master. Little the latter cared about
the life they were consigning the men to.
What they wanted was the $40 "blood
money" each man would bring when he
was once safely shipped.
Among the men sent aboard the Dltton
were John H. Baxter and Guy Talbot.
Both were well known about town and at
one time stood high In the social scale
Drink and a passion for gambling on
horseraces had brought them both to the
last ebb and after a few drinks of water
front whisky had Kone down their
throats they were readv for anything.
After breakfast this morning they were
ordered aloft to help bend the sails. Bax
ter got as far as the main yard and while
trying: to get on the crosstree he lost hla
balance and fell. Instead of falling clear
of the ship his head struck the bulwarks
and he was unconscious and dying \vhÂ»;n
he dropped into the wat^r.
T. Crowley, the boatman, was passing in
his gasoline launch and in a few minutes
he had the dying man aboard and was on
his way to the Harbor Hospital. While
he was being: laid on the operating table
Baxter died.
Deceased had wealthy relatives in Des
â¢Moines, Iowa, and Buffalo. N. Y. When
he first came to San Francisco it was as
agent for the Sussex Shoe Company of
Newtown, X. J. He did remarkably well
and built up a large business. Several
years ago, when business dropped off, the
agency was dlscontinuc-a r.nd Baxter went
to work drumming- up trade for Bucking
ham & Hecht. When drink got the better
of him he had to sever hla connection
with that firm.
After being out of employment for some
time Baxter sobered uo and took the
pledge. Soon afterward he "went on th?
road" for Mauzy & Reid, wholesale shoo
dealers on Market street. A few weeks
ago there was trouble over the disappear
ance of a railroad mileage ticket and Bax
ter was charged with embezzlement. TniÂ»
whole matter turned out to be a mistak-j
and the charge was withdrawn. Baxter
took to drinking again and while under
the Influence of liquor was shipped on tiio
Ditton.
Guy Talbot Is still aboard the Dltton,

NEWS OF OVERDUE FLEET.
German Bark Henry Haekfeld, on
Which Reinsurance Was Paid,
Arrives.
The underwriters were a little, 'more
hopeful while the reinsurance gamblers
were Joyful yesterday when the news of
the arrival of the Henry Haekfeld at
Xaeasakl was cabled. The bark left Phila
delphia 215 days aero and nothing was
heard from her until Thursday night,
when a dispatch to the Merchants' Ex
change announced that on March 13 she
I Â¦was ten miles south of her destination.
When the underwriters first began rein
suring the rate was only 5 per cent, but it
kept on increasing until on Thursday
morning last 35 per cent â¢was procurable.
On the British ship Ardnamurchen,
which left the Frazer River for Liverpool
on November 2G with 73,578 cases of sal
mon, the rate has again gone to 55 per
cent. At one time it was as high aa CO
per cent, but some favorable news mado
the rate drop to 45 per cent. It has been
gradually increasing during the week and
if some news from the vessel does not
come soon it Â¦will take another jump. The
John Moijnnald, now 181 days out from
Baltimore Tor San Francisco, has not ad
vanced any, but the Khorasan, now out
225 days from Tampa for Yokohama, and
the Elizabeth Nicholson, now out 108 days
from British Columbia for Shanghai, have
gene up 5 points and &0 per cent is now be
ing offered by the underwriters. â¢

City Attornsv Lane ; filed an opinion
with the Supervisors' Judiciary Committee
yesterday. In which he holds that the
board has no power to compel the Spring
Valley Water Company to Increase the
size of its mains where they now exist, or
to lay new mains where there are none In
order to secure ample nre protection. The
opinion 'was confirmed by the committee,
which also reported that the board has
no right to force any quasi-public corpor
ation to extend its plant. The opinion
says :
It appears that the Board of Supervisors pur
poses allowing Interest upon $400,000, which haa
not yet been expended by the Spring: Valley
.Water Company. Such action from a legal
standpoint would be miwarrantM. The prin
ciple Is now thoroughly well established that In
the Using of water charges a reasonable rate of
interest shall be allowed upon the plant and
property actually used by the company in the i
supplying of water.
The people are not to be compelled to pay a
higher price for water in order that the com
peny may be enabled to carry out projected
improvements. It is only after such better
ments have become part ot the water supply
system that' the city may allow Interest upon
the Investment made. '
On the general pro, j ."i ion, whether a water
company can be.com;K.-;'.e<l to lay water mains
of "an increased size so as to more' fully protect
the city aeolnst fire, I have discovered no au
thorities whatever, either adjudicated case or
law writer's text, to sustain the contention of
the board.
If irrespective of the matter of water rates
now under your consideration it is desired to
determine the matter in the courts I shall be
pleased to Institute such proceedings as you
may suggest. . . ...
Supervisor Reed submitted an amend
ment to the water rate ordinance yester
day to the Water Committee of the Board
of Supervisors, which provides that if the
Spring Valley Company will agree to per
form all the work designated in the report*
of the Chief Engineer of the Fire Depart
ment at an estimated cost of $433,000 the
city will pay the sum of $20,000 per month
for fire protection and flushing streets and
sewers. If the work is not prosecuted
immediately the Supervisors may retain
out of the -K-ater rates $140,000 of the
money provided for the compensation of
the company.
Reed figures out that under the ordi
nance the company will receive $1,767,499
as revenue, and not $1,669 9S6.10 as reported
by the committee. In other words, the in
come Is reduced by J62.000 and not 5140,000.

The feeling between the attorneys for
the city of Oakland and counsel for the
Contra Costa Water Company is even
more strained than heretofore. Tester
day Judge Hayne. special counsel for the
city, filed an application for a writ of pro
hibition in the Supreme Court which if
granted will prevent Judge Hart of Sac
ramento, who is hearing the case, from
restraining the present Council from fix
ing rates until he has reached a decision.
It appears that the water rate case has
been on trial before Judge Hart since Oc
tober 4. 1SCK). Scores of witnesses have
been examined and a large amount of tes
timony has been taken. On Wednesday
afternoon last the attorneys for the water
company sprung a surprise on the coun
sel for the city. They asked leave to file
a. supplemental complaint, which in itself
was a restraining order preventing the
City Council from fixing rates. Despite
the strenuous objections of Judge Hayne,
the court allowed it to be filed.
When it dawned on counsel for the city
that the filing of the complaint prevented
his clitnts from fixing water rates he pre
pared a lengthy legal document, in which
r.e set forth the entire matter. This-he
tiled with .the Supreme Court clerk yes
ttrfiay.
That the move en the part of the water
ccmpar.y's attorneys was a clever. one is
*>videnced by the facts in the matter. A
fev days ago a new City Council -was
elected in Oakland. The code expressly
states that water rates must be fixed in
February of each year to povern during
the following twelve months that elapse
after July 1. â¢when the rates go into ef
fect. Owing to the present litigation the
present City Council has not had an op
portunity to fix the rates for the coming
ytar. but Intended doing so before their
successors in office came into power in
April. The ruling of Judpe Hart practi
cally nullifies its power and therefore the
City Council, through its counsel, is mak
ing a strenuous effort to have the court's
ruling set aside.
It is said that the water company wouldj
rather have the new Council fix the water
rates, as the corporation fears it might
gret the worst of It if the present Council
does po. At any rate, the matter will un
doubtedly come up for argument before
the Supreme Court within a few days and
some heated arguments will be heard from
both sides.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Tahiti and the Cali
fornia and Oriental Steamship Company"?
Kvarven from China.
The Indiana got away from the wharf
about 12:30 p. m., but it was fully an hour
and a half after that cefore she went to
sea. Her compasses had to be adjusted
and Pilot Ott took her into the upper 'bay
In order to do the work. The Indiana
took away a battalion of the Twenty
eighth Infantry and Company D of/ the
Tenth Infantry. Major Yeatman went
out In command and with -him were Lleu
-tenants Halstead, Dabuev and Peck. As
sistant Timekeeper Brandt, on the trans
port wharf, was taken away much against
his will. He went aboard to say good-by
to some friends and when he came on
deck the gangway was in and the trans
port under way. All the employes on thÂ«
wharf gathered around the lost dolphin
and' waved Brandt. a tender farewell.
Should Brandt not cet ashore on a tug
he will board the pilot boat with Captain
Ott and come ashore this morning.
The America Maru sailed promptly at 1
p. m. and was well on her way to Hono
lulu before the Indiana passed out through
the Golden Gate. She took away 75 cabin
passengers and 115 Chinese in the steerage
An unusually large and valuable cargo
went away on the steamship. The follow

The Oceanic Company's long looked for j
steamship Australia arrived from Tahiti f
yesterday morning. She was looked fo.*
last Sunday, but a detention at Papeete
and continuous head winds and cross seas
caused the delay. She brought up twelve
cabin passengers and a large cargo of
copra and tropical fruits. When the Aus
tralia left Tahiti she had a Chinese named
Ung Tau among the second cabin passen
gers. He was a sick man when he board
ed the vessel, but was particularly anx
ious to reach China before he died. Dr.
Waverly Clark, the ship's surgeon, did
everything possible for the sick man, but
he died March 9 and was buried at sei.
Ung Tau was quite wealthy, having pros
pered in the Southern seas. The following;
were the cabin passungera on the mall
boat:
. "W. B. Hunt. J. Elslnmann. G. J. Kritch and
Â¦wife. Mrs. William H. Barnes, E. Ahue, wire
and child, J. II. Scott and wife, Mrs. A. Fer
guson and Mrs. Michele and, two children.
Becond cabinâ Pierre Bailey, II. M. Arm
strong-, Mrs. M. Piera and Mrs. G. A. Xlebuhr
and four children.
There was very sad news awaiting
Purser F. M. Bucklln when the Australia
docked. His wife is dying of quick con
sumption and it has only been her
strength of will that kept her alive until
the mail boat got in. Mrs. Bucklin was
determined to see her husband once more
and her wish has been gratified.
The California and Oriental Steamship
Company's Kvarven made a good run
from the Orient. She has a very large
cargo of Chinese and Japanese goods but
no passengers. The run from Yokohama
was made in nineteen days, which is good
time for a freight boat. On her wav back
to tho Orient she will probably stop at
San Diego for Eastern freight via the
Santa Fe.
Transports to Sail.
The Meade will get away at noon to-day
with the headquarters and band and two
troops of the Fifteenth Cavalry and a
squadron of the Fifth Cavalry. The latter
arrived from Fort Meyer over the Santa
Fe route yesterday. The Pennsylvania
will sail on Monday next with seven com
panies of the Tenth Infantry, while the
Pak Ling will get away on the same day
Â¦with 750 cavalry horses. The Pak Ling is
very fast for a tramp, being able to aver
age over twelve knots. She will therefore
not be very far behind the Meade at Man
ila and will probably beat both the Indi
ana and Pennsylvania. Into port.

I stated last week that I regarded soap as a medicjneâ that It either bencoCed or injured the whole system; that the pores of thr
t*ody take into the system more or less of the soap. I endeavored -to show how important it is to avoid poisonous fats and strong alkalies*'
I wish to emphasize this point to-Gay, and call special attention to the virtues of Witch Hazel as Nature's greatest remedy for the skirt;*
That the public has found out the truth of this is shown by the hundreds of testimonials I have* already received commending my Witch
Hazel Soap. I had no idea that the demand for it would be so instantaneousâ so large. Orders are coming In from every part of the
country and our factories are taxed to their utmost .capacity to fill the. orders. I feel confident that every cake of soap sold will sell many
more The Soap is all that I claim for it. I want the people to have the same faith in it that they have in' my remedies. Ten years ago
when Hold the public I had a Cure for Rheumatism, they did not believe me. Time has proved, the truth of my statement. > To-day frhen
Hie entire country is stricken with Grippe, there are no remedies on the market having so extensive a sale as my Cold and Grippe Cures
They are demanded because the people know from experience, and from the "say so" of others, that they relieve the H*ad, Nose, Throat arid'
Lungs almost instantlyâ and so I can refer to my Dyspepsia Cure, my Kidney Cure. : and all my remedies" My remedies are sold in every''

Rabbi Jacob Nleto, In his address last
night before the Congregation Sherith-
Israel. asked the question, "Are We Civ
ilized?" In answering the question he
took the stand that we should not accept
the common meaning of the word civili
zation, which he stated, according to tho
dictionary, meant "taking people from a
condition of savagery and barbarianlsm."
The rabbi said:
Whether or not we are civilized is a ques
tion that every Individual should ask himself
at the end of each day. Lowell eald life had
hren trying to civilirÂ« him for more than
seventy years and had met with but llttlo
kucccss. To us civilization should mean more
than the acceptance of the definition from the
dictionary.
After reviewing: the present condition of
affairs the speaker said:
Our prandfathers and great-grandfathers had
their own Ideas of what living In a. proper
and correct manner meant. They believed in
them implicitly and took a (Treat deal of com
fort in becoming adherents of their code. That
which we Rave behind will always be de
nominated as barbarous. We are etill in the
crasp of our preconceived ideas of what is
right and proper. To be civilized, therefore,
means that we shou'.d throw away all our
preconceived ideas of justice and religion.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger spoke on the
question of "The Place of Israel Among
Nations." He said:
The Jews have ever displayed a readiness
and willingness to Ftand by country and flair.
They have fought and bled and surrendered
their lives on the battlefields of iho world.
The first tnen to offer their services to France
were men of Israel. On the sward of Cuba
and in the deadly rice fields and morasses of
the Philippines they have fought and died-.
Despite this e\-ldence they are always con
fronted by the doubt of their Christianity.

f^K | s^ HERE was a sad leavetakins on
1 1 the transport Indiana yesterday
II that was* totally unexpected and
1L tried the heart of every man
aboard the steamship. Bugler W.
P. Hayes of Company D. Tenth Infantry,
had stowed away his wife and with the
assistance of his comrades hoped to get
her to Manila without discovery. Had the
transport cone direct to sea all would
have been well, but Instead she went to
the upper bay, where two hours were
spent in adjusting the compasses.
As the hours crept on Mrs. Hayes made
sure the Indiana was at sea and put her
head out of her hiding place. Aa ill-luck
would have it, a quartermaster was stand-
Ing within a few feet of her and he at
once took her before the captain. As soon
as the boys In blue saw the little woman
on the bridge they knew what was the
matter. A subscription was taken up and
more than twice the amount of the pas
sage money was offered for her berth. It
was against the rules of the transport
I service, however, and Mrs. Hayes was
i sent ashore on the tug Slocum. When
i bidding her husband good-by the tears
rained down her cheeks, and there was
not a man aboard but had to turn away
and pretend to see something of Interest
on the Oakland shore.
The devotion of Mrs. Hayes to her sol
dier husband makes a most romantic
story. Hayes went to Cuba with the
Tenth Infantry, and while there fell in
loveÂ»with a pretty -little Cuban girl. She
was and is an expert seamstress and a
1 first-class dressmaker. The end of the
j courtship was a marriage, and soon there-
GIVES DISCOURSE
ON CIVILIZATION
John B. Hewitt, the wealthy oil land
speculator of Bakersfield, who has been
sued for divorce by Mary E. Hewitt, was
not ready yesterday to proceed with the
hearing of the motion to dissolve the in
junction issued restraining him from dis
posing, of any of his property interests
during the pendency of the litigation. The
motion was set for hearing before Judge
Hunt and a large audience gathered in the
courtroom yesterday morning, expecting
that the first gun in what promises to be
a long and sensational legal battle would
be fired. The spectators were disappoint
ed. When the case was called, Attorney
J. C. Campbell, who represents Hewitt,
asked for a continuance on the ground
that he had not been given sufficient time
to answer the affidavit filed by W. E>.
Grady, of counsel for Mrs. Hewitt, In sup
port of a motion that the defendant be
ordered to pay preliminary alimony, coun
sel fees and costs.
"My client Is In Bakersfleld," said Camp
bell, "and I have not an opportunity to
confer with him on the matter. We dis
pute the marriage and claim that the
agreement on which, the plaintiff rests her
case is not a valid marriage contract. I
ask that a continuance of, say, two weeks
be granted, so that we may be able to pre
pare a counter-affidavit. I am satisfied to
let the Injunction stand until that time."
"We object to any continuance," replied
Attorney Grady. "The motion to dissolve
the Injunction was set for hearing to-day
at the request of the defendant's counsel.
On behalf of Mr3. Hewitt, I now state
that we are ready at this time to prove
the marriage beyond the shadow of a
doubt My client Js without means and if
there is going- to be a continuance she
should be allowed alimony and costs. We
want to bring witnesses from Bakersfleld
and also from Shasta County, where the
marriage took place, but we are without
funds."
"We dispute the marriage," said Camp
bell.
"I am inclined to allow the plaintiff a
reasonable sum for preliminary costs,"
interjected Judge Hunt, "if tho plaintiff la
without means sufficient to secure the wit
nesses necessary to prove her case. The
defendant Is reputed to be wealthy and on
the proper affidavit I will make the neces
sary order."
A lengthy argument followed, at the
conclusion of which Judge Hunt continued
the hearing for one week. In the mean
time Grady will prepare an affidavit show
ing just what expense money hla client
will require to . secure the attendance of
the witnesses from Kern and Shasta
counties.
Mrs. Euphemla E. Poulsen of 1318 Sev
enth street. Oakland, who is vice president
of â¢ the charitable society to which the
three children born to Hewitt and the
plaintiff were entrusted, was In court. She
had with her Gladys, tho second oldest
child. The other children have been
placed with private families In Sausalito.
"Mr. Hewitt came to me In January.
1900." said Mrs. Poulsen yesterday, ''and
told a story of his wife having deserted
him. Ho said that he was unable to prop
erly care for the babies and asked that
our society take them. He surrendered
them to us and signed a paper waiving all
right to them. Since that time our so
ciety has looked after them and secured
them comfortable homes. He has never
contributed anything toward their sup
port, although I understand that he Is
quite wealthy."

LEGAL SKIRMISH
IN HEWITT CASE
The hcarins of thÂ» charges against "Sir"
Harry West wood Cooper, alias Dr.. Ernest
Morre Chad wick, was continued before
Judge Fritz yesterday morning: and was
roafin<-d to 1.- pa! .-*-r$rument8 between couq-
Bel as to the ripM of Miss Nora Schneider,
the latest wife of rtt-Convict Cooper, to
testify In the case.
Â¦ Cooper was brousrht Into court with a
pair cf Fteel handcuffs adornine his
Â¦wrists. He had plumed himself as If for
a garden party. He wore a black suit
and had placed a roÂ«e In the lapel of
his Prince Albert coat. Black gloves
were on his hand?, although his Journey
from his cell to the courtroom was a short
one. The most casual observer could bÂ«Â«
That Cooper was playing for effect and
heped to create a pood impression In the
ryes of the woman he had deceived and
the court spectators. This display of
vanity but served to Intensify the feelings
toward him. and his bow to the family of
The Schneiders was received with scorn.
The morning session was taken up with
the arguments of Assistant District At
torney Whiting- and Attorney Murphy,
who appears for Cooper. Counsel for the
people argued that the fact of the first
marriage of Coor>er had been proved and
that the allegation that Cooper's flrst
Â¦Rife was either dead or divorced when
he married Miss Schneider would have
to he proved by the dcfcr.se.
Attorney Murphy spoke for an hour In
behalf of Cooper, until Judfte Fritz put
an end to the waste of time. Murphy
erg-ued that no proof of the first marriage
had been shown and that the prosecution
should be called upon to prove that the
marriage, with Miys Schneider was big
amous.
"I have enough authorities." said Mur
phjr, "to occupy me a whole year if I read
them."
"Well, the court does not desire to hear
Â¦ ny more of this." said Judgre Fritz. "I
have my regular business to attend to
s:id considerable time has been spent al
ready on this case. I will adjourn the
hrarir.g until Monday afternoon at 2. The
court will now take a recese."
Murphy vainly tried to pet the case
Wrd tÂ«-day, but Judge Fritz decided that
he would not allow Cooper or his attor
ney to block the business of the court.

morrow will say: The general situation Is
without Important change, the events of the
week appearing to accentuate heretofore pre
vailing conditions. Distributive trade and
speculation in securities continue large In vol
ume, with prices rising In the more favored
Industries or dropping In those suffering from
suppression. As types of these movements the
Iron and cotton goods industries are pre
eminent and these two seem like opposite
poles, so marked is the difference In trade In
' feeling and conditions. In most other In
dustries the report was quite favorable, notable
In this direction being the lumber, leather and
hardware and Implement trade. Western and
Southern distributive trade reports are quite
favorable and the reports of active demand
for dry goods and. clothing at the West con
trast- sharply with the reports of dull business
and the receding prlcej of print cloth?, bleached
cottons and other fabrics at first hands.
Railway returns continue highly favorable,
confirming reports heretofore i<*bl!shed of ac
tivity In general shipping,* and reports of a
shortage of cars, a strange one at this . time
of year, come from Chicago and other large
centers. Clearings . arj of heavy volume and
in Â¦ this, as in nearly all other measures of
trade Improvement, present records surpassing
all previously recorded for this season of the
year.
- Conditions In the domestic iron and steel
trade demand recall the boom of 1S99, and It
becomes more and more evident that an enor
mous consumptive demand, discouraged by the
high prices' of a year ago. Is now coming
freely Into the market.
Wool is in larger sales and foreign markets
are quite strong. Eastern : stocks are said to
be small and declining and the situation Is
gradually readjusting , itself.

Prices this week have been strong and on
the whole advanced, while the activity was
considerable... The chief qualification that can
be observed In the speculative situation Is
that the public Is not In the market. Large
interests support their specialties and evi
dence confidence In the future of prices and
the manipulation of different j securities has
the support of the traders and j professional
clement generally. Commission house business
!â¢â¢ slow and the chief feature, so far as the
outside participation Is concerned, is the
steady Investment buying of bonds and dlvl
dcnd-paylng stocks. This process continues
to absorb large amounts of railroad securities
of the better class and to take them out of
the market, while lt Is also observed that there
1-as been no selling pressure. The continued
ease of money has been a factor, there being
but slight appearance of any hardening of
rates over April 1, and the fact that on Friday
pome $25,000,000 was disbursed In dividends . on
various stocks created no previous disturbance
of loans. Some little hardening of time loan
rates was observed, but the developments were
net sufficient to encourage bearish feelings in
the face of the railroad ' earnings, the more
or less favorable crop outlook and' the activity
of the Iron and steel trade.

which started upward then, while aggressive

the latter Burlington msM the most conspicuous,
all things considered, and had the most In-
Cupnco in encouraging buying of other stocks.
It v.as lifted S>i points over j aEt n igjjt at one
time in siiite of the diajging tendency of other

the Chicago Great Western stocks, the common
and preferred "B" of the latter company re
lapsing \iolently from their recent show of
Kirengrh. The anthracite coalers also suffered
from profit-taking on v.sterday's late advance.
There was a midday spurt in the group led by
the ErifF. but they fel 1 . back again on re
newed Ftrength. These Western stocks showed
a nr table check to thuir recent strong upward
tendency and sold Et^adily all day. The St.

EASTERN MARKETS.
face of our slight decline yesterday. Moderate
Northwest receipts were a contributory factor
In the strength. Profit-taking on a fairly lib
eral scale forced the market back to 75%c early.
Offerings became lighter at this decline and
the market steadied and slowly rallied to 76c.
Lonfrs again sought profits, but numerous short
linos needed protection at that figure and after
hesitating a few minutt-s the market shot up
to 76Hc and closed 3trung. 14@lUc over yes
terday.. St. Louis interests, presumably cover-
Ing shorts, were heavy purchasers over 76c.
Corn was firm and the trade was on a lib
eral scale at times. Higher cables, unsettled
weather, light country otterings and sympathy
with wheat caused a strong feeling. May
closed U@Hc higher at 414Â®41Hc.
Oats were moderately active and firm In
sympathy with corn and wheat. May closed
4@V t c higher at 25HÂ®25Uc.
Light hog receipts, higher prices for hogs
and the grain strength combined to support
the provision market. May pork closed 274c
higher, lard and ribs fach 10c up.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
CHICAGO. March 15.â The day's trade In
wheat was heavy. May opened %c higher at
75%@753Â»c,. influenced by lighter Argentine ship

NEW YORK, March 15.-The following ta

ended March- 14, with the percentage of In

responding wtek last year.

ll'hcat and Barley advanced again.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Failures for the week were 209 In the United
States, against 190 last year, and 83 In Canada,
against 23 last year.
Further declines are reported in wool, making
a material fall since the month opened. At the
last concession Boston holders exhibit an In
clination tÂ» refuse bids and there Is more in
dication of steadiness than previously this sea-
Bon, i â¢ â¢
Prospects for a good winter .wheat crop are
bright, y \
Steel mills are still much behind their orders,
and contracts Tor Bessemer piK for J ulv deliv
ery Indicate that the activity is not considered
temporary." Yet the wide difference in quota
tion between Immediate and distant sales sug
gests some fear that the present high prices
cannot be maintained. While the various pools
and associations are extremely conservative
about advancing nominal price lists, actual
business continues to be transacted at pre
miums, which are according to the urgency of
purchasers. Structural material Is still a fea
ture, and the rapid development of newly dis
covered oil fields Is creating an unusual demand
for plates, pipes .and drilling machinery. Steel
rail contracts have been Increased and rail
ways need rollirig stock. PIgiron production,
according to the Iron Age, has Increased to
J32.3S9 tons weekly, which is about 5000 tons
below the high record of February 1. 1900. It
is surprising to find, despite an output at the
rate of over 15.000,000 tons annually, that fur
nace stocks decreased â¢ 21.236 tons 'during Feb
ruary, making: the total 535.443 tons on March
1. agarnst 670,531 tons f.ve months ago.
Boot and shoe shops are well occupied, East
ern factories having their full capacity en
gaged In some cases up to September 1, and
even the less fortunate makers have contracts
for some months. . Leather is active and welt
sustained.- Slight Improvements In special lines
of textiles are occasionally noticed, but prices
are maintained with difficulty.
all Iron and steel products that can be deliv
ered, heavy grain exports at good prices, activ
ity in miner industries and a money market
that imposes no hardship upon business com
prise the bright side of the picture of the week.
Threatening labor troubles seem more remote.
The textile markets, long backward, have again
failed to respond to the general confidence in
commercittl circles. A slight rally in cotton
was not held and the toods market shows a
decline In a month from 5*4 to 5%c in standard
brown sheetings, at 22 to 21c in wide sheetings.
5*; to 6c In fine brown drills and 5% to 5V4c In

Harrison's circular nays: "During th* week
tnere nave been four arrivals of coal from
British Columbia. 12.331 tons: eight from Wash
ington. 23.150 tons; two from Oregon. 122C
tons; one from Australia. 1241 tons; total, 33 -
002 tons. The quantity coming to- hand is
fully supplying all Immediate calls, both for
house and steam uses, hence the prices aro
steady, and business Is fairly well maintained
Prophecies of varied characters are being made
as to the future of the coal market locally
The domestic demand will be fully equal to
former years, as It cannot be displaced by
other fuels, as no substitutes can be found for
coal. For steam uses for manufacturing pur
poses coal will be largely displaced by fuel
oil. on the grounds of economy. Already scat
tered through the city tanks are being placed
for the reception of oil where -coal wa< for
merly used. Our street railroads, large build
ings with elevators, and large and small fac
tories are gradually drifting Into Its use. All
our bay and ocean steamers will doubtless ad
hero to coal consumption, as the Insurance
risk I* materially Increased by the utilizing
of any. other fuel.- hence the coal sales per an
num will remain large, notwithstanding the
Influx of fuel oil Into the market. The de
crease of Imports of foreign coal will cause a
maintenance of high outward grain freights
as incoming vessels will not receive the gen
erous . coal freights formerly ruling, and will
demand high freights outward to make rood
the difference."

Entertainment without surfeit, honors
without fatigue, will be the aim of the
committee appointed to supervise Oak
land's reception to President McKInley
on the occasion of the Chief Executive's
approaching visit to the city. The com
mittee has borne in mind the fact that

be asked from the eminent visitor.
The plans, as laid before the Board of
Trade by Mayor Snow this morning and
approved by that body, begin with a
carriage ride from Berkeley, where the
President will deliver the commencement
oration, to the home of Senator George
C. Perkins on Vernon Heights.
School children drawn up in line along
the route to be traveled by the Presiden
tial party will scatter flowers in the road
way. There will be no pelting, say the
committee. v
At the Perkins residence the reception
committee will deliver the freedom of the
city to the President and he will meet
socially some of Oakland's most promi
nent citizens.
From Vernon Heights tho party Â¦will
drive through gayly decorated streets to
the Macdonough Theater, where it is
hoped that the President will deliver a
brief address. After the exercises there
the Presidential party will be driven- to
the pier where a Government vessel will

The new agricultural director has been

to take a course at the "Cow College"
at Berkeley in order to properly fit him

Failure to Secure a Pension Cause3
Daniel J. Curley to Take His
" Own Life.
â¢ Daniel. J. Curley. formerly a member
of Company M. First California Regi
ment, committed suicide In a tragic fash
ion early last night in a saloon on Her
man and Valencia streets. He had been
wounded in the war and became de
spondent when he failed to secure aj*nj
delplte the efforts made by bystanders to
prevent him from doing so. â¢
Th^ ; service* of a physician were of no
aâ¢? and" CurleV dfcd X In a short time.
His body was taken to the Mor 5 u *i -ll ,-^
Curley was 24 yearrof age and .resided
with his parents at 119 Page street.
Jaunt has made him fall In love with a
mercantile life which entitles one to a
membership In such a club as the Chicago
Commercial and declares that when he
gets back he will . strike Field for a Job
and be a millionaire in no time.
Marshall Field is a remarkable looking
man and he ought to be, he's worth $50,
000,000. He bears no resemblance what
ever to the accepted idea of a Chicago
millionaire. He has a rubicund face,
which, with his whit* hair and mustache,
upright figure and generally well-groomed
appearance makes him the beau ideal of
a military officer.
"You San Franciscans are extraordinary
people." he said, as he sat in a sheltered
place on the upper deck. "I was out here
twenty years ago <-.nd X thought so then.
From what I can fee of the city now you
are so still. "We of Chicago have a name
for enterprise, but I think a good deal of
that spirit has got West. Your country
fs receiving plenty, of advertising in the
East and we all arc beginning to look
"West when we spÂ«;ak of development:
Speaking for myself I may : say. and 1
think this holds true of all oUr party. I
am out here only for pleasure and do not
intend to transact any business, though
of course none of us are overlooking good
chances."
. "Now, look here," Eald Caton. "I'm not
very good to be back in California again,
and in such good company, that after all
makes the real enjoyment of such an ex
cursion as this."
General Merrltt's rubicund face beamed
as he spoke, and he turned to point out
the Presidio and explain the harbor de
fenses to Marshall Field.
The cicerone and jester of the party is
Arthur J. Caton, who is one of Chicago's
best known lawyers, and whose reputation
as a post-prandial speaker and raconteur
rivals the fame of one Chauncey Depew.
Caton, who bears a great facial resemb
lance to Depew. Is not a member of the
Commercial Club, but travels as the guest
of Marshall Field. He eays the present

SO SA2CG Longfellow, but If he
could have witnessed the arrival
of the Chicago Commercial Club,
and Its guests a-t Oakland mole
last night he 'would have changed
the verse relating to the heritage qf care.
True these men who stepped from the
velvet-cushioned, steam-heated. elect|-ic
lighted special to the dreary blackness
and clrt of the mole were not the sons of
wealth, they were the accumulates of
it. but if Longfellow's eong held good this
would only have cerved to depress them
further: but a Jollier party never took
the ferry, and the value of the human
freirht the Piedmont carried was $1,000,
(â¢00.000. Viewed with this fact In mind,
the party v.as extraordinary. Its mem
bers represented the men behind the
wheels of finance, the engineers who with
u turn of the wrist could depress or ele
vate trade, yet looked at elmply as a
group of excursionists they were ordi
nary.
An adverse stroke of fortune, the first
the millionaires have encountered In their
long Journey, caused the Franklin tun
nel to cave in. and the Chlcagoans' spe
cial, which was due at Point Richmond
at C:S0. rolled into Oakland at 9 o'clock,
two hours and a half behind time. News
of the accident reached the excursionists
when they arrived at Bay Point and their
train was run over on to the Southern
Pacific's tracks.
Ik Marvel Bays that wealth Is a secur
ity for gentleness, and so It seems. The
delay and tardy arrival might have irri
tated many, but these kings of finance
were as Jolly as sandboys over It, In fact
they seemed to regard It as rather for
tunate Elnce it gave the Journey that
variety which is said to lend spice to ex
istence
Fine View From Ferry Boat. .
John L. Truslow*. city passenger agent
of the Santa Fe, welcomed the excursion
ists and saw that they were all conveyed
5n comfort to this side. The Piedmont
lay In waiting- and most of the visitors
crowded on her forward deck, turning up
their collars and pulling down their hats
to keeD off the cool night breeze. The
night was an ideal one. The bay was
smooth as glass. The lights of the city
ehone distinctly as diamonds against the
clear sky. which rivaled the mundane
illuminations in star-spangled brilliance.
These same stars came in for plenty of
admiration, and when a millionaire looks
at stars It is a proud day for the stars,
for to stargaze is reputed poetical, and it
takes a strong attraction to awaken a
financier's poetry.
Many of the party had been to San
Francisco before and these were kept busy
pointing out the lions to their less trav
eled neighbors. "Who would have Imagined
to see these men taking such a delighted
Interest in ex-erything they saw that they
were a party of sober-minded financiers?
The Piedmont itself came in for favor
able mention by these visitors who found
everything so delightful, and many of
them examined the "works" with an in
terest which would have been almost
childish had It not been so sincere.
It was the costliest load the old Pied
mont ever carried, and the aged craft has

Grouping of Multimillionaires.
All such excursions resolve themselves
naturally into little groups or cliques of
men by a eort of natural selection, which
attains its greatest perfection on a trip
of this sort. O\-er In a corner Bat a min
ing machinery manufacturer, the biggest
in his line in America, chatting gaily with
his companion, a railroad king. A multi
millionaire packer offered a cigar to a
wholesale grocery magnate, and men
whose wealth might purchase a city told
and listened to stories and anecdotes grave
and gay.
The clothes they wore were as various
In character as the wearers. They ranged
from the natty tweed to the substantial
broadcloth, and from the racy Raglan to
the business-like covert coat. There were
men of all ages there, from white-haired
picturesque-looking John J. Janes, the
secretary of the Chicago Commercial Club
to Rollln A. Keyes, the "baby" of the
party. A baby born with a golden spoon
in his mouth.
An Interesting figure, hardly so much
for what he Is. although that Is no small
thing, as for the stock he eprang from
was Robert T. Lincoln, son of the martyr
President, a trans-Atlantic prototype of
his Majesty King Edward VII of Great
Britain. .
Looks Like Zing Edward.
Lincoln la president of the Pullman Pal
ece Sleeping Car Company and In rated
many time* a millionaire. He was very
anxious to conceal his identity last night
but gracefully admitted his Identity when
he saw he was recognized. Lincoln, it is
not hard to pee. Is very well aware of his
likeness to the British monarch and care
fully regulates his bearing to coincide
Â¦with that of Edward. It Is all there- the
peculiar slouching- walk, the 6toop of the
shoulders, the manner of standingâ and
the hat. The president of the Pullman
wore a long li?ht coat and clothes of evi
dent English vintage. Mr. Lincoln is the
presiding spirit of a little party who will

wrote a note In Chinese to be given to
the, immigrant and. gave Blackburn $1
promising him $2 50 more when he should
turn over the reply. Blackburn reported
to the Chinese Bureau, the note was
translated and an .Inspector sent to the
dock to arrest Lul Hing as soon as the
letter should be placed into his hands.
Hingr. caught Bight of the Inspector, tor*
the letter Into several pieces and swal

William A. Fuller, of Palmer. Fuller &

talker. ,
"Your oil development Is a matter of
great talk In the East," he said, "and
there is plenty of good advertising being
done to help it out. I don't think that
any one in the East fully realized up to
a few years ago what a wonderful coun

LAST NIGHT AND AFTER A HARASSING DELAY BEHELD, MANY OF THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME THE
LIGHTS OF SAN FRANCISCO. ....
Stationary white signals are shortly. to
be abandoned by the Southern Pacific
Railroad and green lights are to be sub
stituted. It Is claimed by railroad men
that white, being a signal of safety, ought
not to be used for a number of reasons.
Engineers on a fast express train can eas
ily mistake a light from a house for that
of a switch signal and an accident might
result from the error. Several roads have
abolished white as a signal switch. The
Baltimore and Ohio and the Chicago
Northwestern use only preen. .
General Manager Kruttschnltt of the
Southern Pacific said yesterday that the
change would be made at once. He says
that the company acts undpr the Ameri
can Railway Association rules, that this
organization dictates the color of signals
and that It has adopted this rule.
Southern Pacific Railroad
Will Use This Color
as a Signal.
