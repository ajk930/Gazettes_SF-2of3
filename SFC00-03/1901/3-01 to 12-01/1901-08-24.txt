dent Castro. Aware of the fact that dis
satisfaction with' his administration in
Venezuela is daily increasing, he hopes, to
prevent- Venezuelans from ejecting him
from the presidency by uniting them in a
war against Colombia. This explains his
action in issuing proclamations announc
ing that Colombia' has invaded Venezuela,
and in sending - Venezuelan troops on
board the Venezuelan gunboats to attack
Colombia by_ j way of the sea coast. This
latter action of President Castro is an act
of war against Colombia; President Cas
tro cannot make the excuse that this ex
pedition is composed of Colombian insurg
ents who have organized on -Veriezuelah
soil In spite of the vigilance of Venezue
lan officials. Aside from this fact there is
evidence that this expedition is composed
of -Venezuelan troops, and < the men .who
compose it were carried in Venezuelan

OAKLAND, Aug. , 23.â Evidences of the
strike in Oakland are very few and far

The decision of the longshoremen to han
dle lumber after it had been deposited
upon the docks, even If it were unloaded
by non-union crews, has done much to
settle the question as far as Oakland Is
concerned. Lumber Is now being moved
very rapidly and there is no danger of
any tie-up in the building trades.
With this condition among the shipping
the tie-up at the wharves is practically
broken. The teamsters are beginning to
go back to work. The men formerly em
ployed by James P. Taylor,. the coal mer
chant, decided that if the longshoremen
are given the privilege of handling lumber
after it has been unloaded by non-union
help they should have the - privilege_ of

the men formerly employed by Taylor ap

refused to discharge the non-union men

and he reinstated five of his old men.

"What little chance for a coal famine

There is a slight scarcity in some lines of
coal. Especially is this true in regard to
the Wellington, which is brought down
from British Columbia. ' .

coal, 7 a supply sufficient for all immediate
demands. : - â¢ - : â¢ ... â¢
"When the Brotherhood of Teamsters and

could not possibly last more j than ten

The committee from the Building Trades

settlement that would involve agreement
upon a wage of less than $3 50 per day.
After a long discussion, and a considera

master painters finally agreed to concede
the demand of the union, and work will
be resumed on that basis, the employers to
reinstate their former employes as far as
possible. The two committees will be
made permanent, to arbitrate difficulties
in future.
The number of men who have been out

STAMP EXAMINER STORY AS FAKE
TO demonstrate that the draymen of San Francisco are liars when they say they are paying- $5 a day and
under for teamsters to take the place of the strikers the Examiner published affidavits yesterday of three
men who claim to be striking teamsters â Thomas Brennan. Michael Lally and William Andson. These men
assert in their affidavits that on August 19 they applied at a saloon at 105 Mason street and were engaged to
drive for Austin & Co. of the Overland Freight Transfer Company by a Mr. Wheaton. -Brennan asserts that he
was promised $10 per day and a bonus of $i, ora total of $n'per day, to drive a four-horse dray. Lally and And
son make affidavit that they were promised a total of $8 each per day to drive two-horse drays. -
The speciousness of these carefully worded affidavits is made apparent by the statements of affiants that
they did not report for work, and hence cannot know whether the man Wheaton acted with authority or not. ,
The affidavit of the officers of the Overland Freight Transfer Company,' in which it is declared that no such
offers were authorized by the company and that only unjop rates have been paid or offered to drivers, stamps the
Examiner story as utterly unreliable and partaking of the character of the "Let it rot" fake which was perpetrated
in the effort to discredit Frank J. Symmes and the Employers' Association.
The union rates paid by the company alluded to are $3 for the driver j)l a two-horse dray and $3 50 for the
driver of a four-horse dray. Following is the affidavit: â¢

THE worklngmen of San Francisco
â¢who are now on strike will parade
at 1 o'clock to-day under the lead
ership of Michael Casey, president
of the City Front Federation, as
rrand marshal. It is expected that fully
10,000 men will be In line.
The purpose of the daylight parade Is to
show to the public the numerical strength
of the strikers. AH of the trades now on
strike will be represented with the excep
tion of the allied iron trades. None of
these will be seen in the line, as notifica
tion of the parade failed to reach the
Iron Trades (Council in time, so that the
machinists could not be properly notified.
Another probable reason Is that many of
the iron trades strikers are absent from
the city at the present time, and a suf
ficiently imposing show of that craft
would be impossible.
The line of march will be from Sailors'
Hall, at East and Mission streets, north
on East to Battery, along Battery to Mar-
Vet, along Market to Third, down Third to
Brannan, down Brannan to Pacific Mail
dock, thence to East and Mission. The
march will begin promptly at 1 o'clock in

COMPUXSOBY ARBITRATION.
Dr. John A. Miller Submits an Orig
inal Flan.
At a meeting of the Iroquois Club held
last night at Pythian Castle, Dr. John A.
Miller discussed the feasibility of having
all labor difficulties settled by compulsory
arbitration. He reviewed at length the
manner in which the arbitration laws
were operated In New Zealand and 'gave
many reasons why the same laws would
apply to the conditions existing here.
Dr. Miller submitted the following plan
for .compulsory arbitration as a possible
solution of the labor problem:
When fifty or more workmen combine them
selves into a labor union they shall be re
quired to Incorporate within twenty days
tinder a sr>ecial act which provides rules and
regulations.
When three or more employers combine for
their mutual protection or furtherance of their
respective trades or occupations they shall be
required to incorporate under the same act;
a less number shall be jointly or individually
dealt with as a corporation under the same
law.
Disputes between the above corporations
shall be adjusted, provided that written no
tice of their demands Fhall be given by any
person or persons at least ten days before
t&kir.tr eteps in furtherance thereof.
Within ten days of the notice of their de
mand a committee of two, appointed by each.
Khali attempt to arbitrate the dispute; if this
committee cannot agree, the committee Is to
appoint by mutual consent a third person, and
if then no agreement can be reached the mat
ter must be referred for compulsory arbitra
tion to a commission created for this purpose.
The compulsory arbitration committee must
not be a permanent body, but a temporary
creation for the purpose of arbitrating the
particular dispute in question.
The commissioners Fhall be appointed in the
following manner: The labor union shall
nominate one person and the employer, em
ployers or employers" corporation, as the case
may.be. another person, and these two shall
nominate a third, and if the two first nominees
fail to 'agree, the nomination shall be incum
bent upon a Superior Judge.
These three nominations shall be confirmed
by the Superior Court and by such confirmation
thai! constitute the commissioners of .said
court. They shall -Investigate the' merit* of
the controversy, after which a majority or all
Â«hr** ehall make their report to the court and
their decision shall be final and constitute the
Judgment.
With the flllne of their report the life of
the commlffion efcall expire.
Tber* shall be fines and' penalties for the
disobedience cf the judgment, and either one
r>r both parties to the controversy rha.ll stand
in contempt and be punished according to the
pro\iEions of this act.
THE executive committee of the
San Francisco Labor Council is-
Bued yesterday afternoon the fol
lowing: open letter:
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler. University
of California. Berkeley, Cal.â Dear Sir: You
are aware, no doubt, of the struggle now go
ing on between labor and capital on this
coast. You mu3t feel, as we do, that on the
issue depends the fate of the American work
ingmanâwhether he is to be an Intelligent
human. being, a 'free man Jin a, free land or a
mere animal to be driven and controlled like
a beast of burden. The plain and . common
rights of roan are at stake. Should capital
triumph Just now there can be no more free
Institutions, since there Is no longer Individ
ual liberty, and social evolution will give
place to unmistakable reversion.
A university stands for progress. It stands
for the development of the human mind, for
the upbuilding of the race, for intellectual ex
pansion along the broadest lines. Whenever
it ceases to stand for that it ceases to be a
university. It respects not persons. In its
lecture halls all are equal â rich and poor, high
and low. It looks to mind, not to nana or
dollars. Its aim is to build up not to pull
down or disintegrate. It is the great and
ideal democratic Institution where Is the
throne of the people and where brain makes
Its realm and reigns. Consequently It Bhould
be always Just, always a power making for
righteousness in the community. It cannot
consistently favor one class at the expense of
another. Especially It cannot favor the rich
at the expense of the poor and expect to be
called a university.
All this is Â¦ particularly true of a university
which has been created by the will of the
people find built and supported by their
moneys. Such a school is essentially the peo
ple's school and all the people have a right
to expect fair treatment from it. It would
be a bad day for our State University when
it took part in a struggle in which two
classes of its supporters were engaged. It
would fall in its noble mission the day on
which it antagonized any considerable num
ber of those by whose will It exists. Other
schools built by private money may perhaps
afford to take the side of the rich man and
the corporations. Such a thing has, we trunk,
happened within our memories. You can
judge if the gain has been on the side of the
university. But no matter what the rulers
of a private school- may see fit to do. a State
Institution cannot afford to take sides. The
people are its masters and it must be con
ducted in whatever way the people demand
it shall be conducted.
You must have seen in the daily papers
that come students of the State University
gave up their books and hired themselves to
men who have sworn to trample on the lib
erty of the worklnsrinen of California. We
wish to call your attention to the matter and
to ask you If the State University -approves
of this p.ciion of its students? Remember that
the worklngman pays his taxes in equal pro
portion with the capitalist. Indeed, it is gen
erally supposed that the workingman pays a
higher proportion. The workingman then is
paying for the education of those men and
the return he gets Is that they Join his en
emies in a determined effort to enslave him.
Are those men a type of the Berkeley student?
We are taxpayers and are within our Just
rights when we ! ask you what you think
about the matter. We know what we think
about it. and we are decidedly of opinion that
such acts on the part of Berkeley students
will not be tolerated by the people of this
State and that the people will not be eager
to support an institution which wii.hout pro
test allows its members to Join in an - unholy
effort to crush the spirit of the people.
Do you think the action of those students
will tend to improve the position of the uni
versity In the Â¦ eyes of the people of Califor
nia? Something big, something broad and
liberal is expected of such a school as that of
which you are the head. You are supposed
to give a liberal education. Is it one of the
marks of a liberal education that those who
receive it gratuitously should do what even
uneducated men consider vile and Infamous?
Labor is honorable, but not all labor. There
are conditions which make it dishonorable
and your students have placed these condi
tions.
A liberal education makes those who are
capable of receiving it gentlemen. Of course
there are exceptions. You can't make a silk
purse out of a sow's ear. To your mind are
those who took the places of honest working
men In Oakland gentlemen? Are they the
kind of persons for whose education the peo
ple ought to pay taxes? Have they not shown
a> decided vocation for positions to fill which
a university education is by no means neces
sary? We can hardly think that our Slate
University will stand for such men or that
you. Its respected head, will be altogether
proud of this product of your school. The
State has been generous with the university.
It has â¢ riven freely and is prepared to give
more. It Is proud of the school. But If this
great State school turns out only poor scholars
of the amateur stevedore type then â¢ we fear
the people will begin to consider whether after
all it is worth while supporting such a school.
We respectfully, bring the matter to your
notice and ark you if the State University ex
ists altogether for the benefit of the rich?
Public opinion is strong, and we can assure
you that the people are not at all disposed
to pay for the establishment in the State
l/nlverslty of a department for the education
of well.- say stevedores. Yours truly.
By order of the executive committee of the
. San Francisco Labor Council.

Third Officer Gage says the Lane will
undoubtedly be a total wreck. She Is
piled up on the rocks a mile and a half
from Cape Mohican, at the extreme west
erly end of Nunivak Island, in as bad a
place as could be found on the entire isl
and. She is settling on the rocks an<T-it
is a question of only a short time before
she goes to pieces. Captain Ames keenly
feels his misfortune in the loss of ,tJie
vessel. When the accident occurred, at
11:25 o'clock on the night of July 13. there
was a dense fog and the steamer*" ivai
running at half-speed. The rocks would
have been cleared on a course less tl>an
600 feet further westward, but in that
vicinity the currents are strong and de
ceptive and reckonings are lost in a fog.
It seems that the steamer Discovery
was to have been sent out from Nome to
the Lane as soon as the news of the
wreck was received, but the Discovery
met a slight accident and proceeded to
Dutch Harbor instead.
SEATTLE, Aug. 23.â Third Officer B. F.
Gage of the wrecked steamship Charles
D. Lane arrived at St. Michael on Au
gust 1 with a boat's crew of four men.
after a nine days* trip in an open boat.
During that time they experienced grea:
hardships and were threatened with star
vation as well as death by drowning.
"When the passengers on the Lane had
been transferred to the schooner Vega
and sent back to Nome It was expect:e-l
that relief would come within a few days.
Consequently Captain Ames allowed the
greater portion of the provisions that
were saved to be taken by the schooner
and kept the entire crew of fifty-two men
at the scene of the wreck with a limit :d
supply of food. The wreck occurred on
July 13, and when ten days had passed
and relief had not arrived Third Officer
Gage and four seamen started for St.
Michael In one of thÂ« ship's boats, with
a message from Captain Ames, addressed
to the revenue cutter service or the Dep
uty Collector of Customs In St. Michael.
Unfavorable weather conditions caused, so
much delay that they did not reach St.
Michael until August L Meantime most
of the food they had brought with them
became spoiled and they arrived almost
famishing with hunger^ and thirst, tho
water that they brought also being bad.
Captain Ames stated in hl3 message,
dated July 23, that food was then run
ning low and they must have immedlata
relief. The revenue cutter Nunivak waa
at St. Michael, but she is purely a river
craft, not fitted for deep* water serv1"e.
and Lieutenant J. C. CantwelL In com
mand, could offer no relief. Deputy Col
lector J. B. Causten sent the men to Nome
on the steamer Dora and the agents of
the wrecked steamer are expected to send
relief from that point immediately.

Advices from Skaguay of the latest date
state that after some of the bodies were
washed ashore ghoulish acts were com
mitted by Indians. At that time" the coast
was not in control of patrolmen and the
bodies cast ashore were temporarily un
protected. As soon as it was discovered
in Juneau that the work of robbing 1 the
corpses was in pi-ogress the United States
Marshal dispatched a number of deputies
to the scene, and at the da,te of the sail
ing of the Hating it was understood that
several of the ghouls had been appre
hended. . â¢ j
Of the bodies recovered nine were burled
in Juneau. It is understood that a ma
jority of the interred remains were those
'of members of the crew.'
It is believed that some bodies yet re
main within the wreck. As yet the task
of raising the vessel'has not been consid
ered, buf soundings will soon be made to
ascertain accurately the depth at which
the Islander lies. Should this prove to
be under thirty-five fathoms it Is very
likely that an attempt will be made to
raise the wrecked vessel.

Attorney Dillon of Los Angeles, who is

contract is a clever piece . of swindling
work. It is so worded as to seem all right
but a careful examination of it shows that
Miss Burke practically agrees to purchase
the mining 'claims, and that, if she does
not make the. purchase she is to forfeit
$12,000. -,-Â¦ â¢Â¦
Miss Burke now declares she has learned
that Marrs has but a half interest in the
mines and that the money she Invested
has not been spent in carrying on the de
velopment work. She claims she has been
swindled and asks the court to right the
wrong. She asks that the contract drawn
up between her and Allured and Marrs be
canceled on the ground that she was
induced to sign by Â¦ fraudulent misrepre
sentations.' â¢ ; ,
In- the complaint she declares that she
was induced to spend large sums of money
in the development' of the Crown, Altissl
mus and Red Copper mines in the Bullion
mining district of this county. She was
given to understand by the defendants,
and especially by Allured, who was acting
as her agent, that Marrs had clear title
to the claims, which are said to be worth
$3,000,000, and that if she would supply the
money to carry on the development work
she could share as a. one-third' owner in
the profits of the mine. She alleges that
she gave her entire time to the scheme
and expended large sums of money in de
velopment of the mining property, as she
supposed. " . - .

YER WHO PROLONGED HIS LIFE
NINE YEARS.
SEATTLE*, Aug. 23.â Charles W.
Nordstrom was hanged this morn
ing at 9:49 o'clock for the murder'
on November 27, 1891. of William
Mason. From early morning the
condemned man was on the verge of utter
collapse, and while ministers and mem
bers of the Salvation Army prayed with
him he cried continually.
Shortly after 9:30, o'clock Nordstrom
was brought from the room in which he
had teen detained, just adjoining the ex
ecution room. It required the assistance
of four men to keep him on his feet.
, When he was taken Into the presence
of the scaffold he broke down entirely.
Crying "In a childish voice and praying
that his life be spared him, he fell to the
floor.
Efforts tc raise him and keep him on
his feet were fruitless, and at last Sheriff
Cudihee ordered that a board be brought.
To this Nordstrom was strapped. It re
quired six men to hold him while this was
being done. While being strapped to the
board Nordstrom continued to shriek and
cry. Several times he seemed to speak,
but his words were unintelligible. The
six men who had held him raised his body
on the board and with great effort suc
ceeded in getting him upon the gallows
and the fatal trap. Â¦ There he was stood
upright, four of the men standing on the
four sides of the trap and holding him.
In iess than two seconds after the con
demned man was in place the trap was
sprung and Nordstrom had paid the pen
alty of his crime.
The trap was sprung at 9:49 o'clock and
Nordstrom was pronounced dead at 10:02

It Is believed that Old Clubfoot had
been living in the high mountains since
he was traced to Nevada. He is described
as being an unusually large fellow, even
for a grizzly, weighing about 3000 pounds.
He Is supposed to be more than 60 years
old.
From that time until his appearance In
Alpine County he has kept out of sight.
Recently he appeared at the ranch of a
man named Benson, where he reduced the
visible supply of mutton. A large crowd
gathered at Markleeville and a start was
made on Tuesday of last week. At the
time Dolling and his party left nothing
had been heard as to the success of the
hunting expedition.
After that the grizzly was traced
through different counties" and many were
the hunting parties sent out after him.
Many times it was believed he was se
curely surrounded, but he always man
aged to escape. '
In the sixties Old Clubfoot dropped
out of sight. Nothing was heard of him
for several years, until one night about
twenty-five years ago. there was a dis
turbance in a log corral in which there
was a large band of sheep, on Blood's
place, and a herder went out to see what
was the trouble. Just as he put his head
over the gate a bear smote him a terrible
blow on the head, completely scalping
him. The tracks In the dust showed that
Old Clubfoot was still alive and back
at his stamping grounds. A hunt was
organized, but the bear escaped.
Again the grizzly dropped out of sight
for about ten years. When he reappeared
it was In Mono County, he having trav
eled as far as Bodie. At that place he
was given a big hunt, but managed to
get away, although he received several
wounds. After that he was traced over
into Nevada, where he kept up his old
tricks of raiding sheep ranches for his
daily food.
ANGELS CAMP. Aug. 23.â Otto Dolling.
Henry Hogart and George Posey have
returned from a camping trip, up above
Silver \ City, in Alpine County. The
country around there is very wild and
game of all kinds is plentiful. The day
the party left for home a big hunt was
being organized for the purpose of trail
ing Old Clubfoot, a big grizzly bear
known from one end of the State to the
other, which has caused a great deal of
trouble and damage in his life, and which
at the present time is creating a lot of
trouble for stockmen In the mountains.
Just a few days before the party left for
home he visited' a sheep camp and raised
"rough house" among the men.
Old Clubfoot was first heard of in Ne
vada County in the winter of 1857.. At
that time a trapper found half' of the
brute's left hind foot In a bear trap which
he had set. Next the grizzly a'ppeared in
Plumas County, where he killed a man
in the mountains, devouring all of his vic
tim except one foot. The snow was on
the ground at the time and the tracks
showed that In healing the bearfs foot
had drawn until it was like a club foot,
and he was thereupon named Old Club
foot.

Glistening with oil the swimmers stood
upon their marks for the jump off, but
at the first attempt Leary, in his eager
ness, beat the pistol and both were called
back. Again they tried the start and again
Leary got off in front. By this time tha
oil Â¦was washed off the men, so they went
back to Trainer Lean for a fresh applica
tion. The flag fell on the third attempt
and both men cut out a pace that, if sus
tained, everybody knew would be a record
breaker. Leary seemed to move through
the water at a faster rate than Wiede
man, but when the eye measured the rela
tive positions both men might have been
placed on a line. They took all the turns
together and It was only on the last lap
that Leary gained his slight advantage,
which was about eight Inchesâ Just
enough to win the race.

Is not a^matter of frequent occurrence.
Of all Â¦> serious places,, serioiis undertak
ings and serious persons the golf links,
golfing and golfers should be awarded
first place. The very few people who go
up to the links stand around in solemn
little. bunches, watch the game with seri
ous, long drawn faces and never speak
except to say "good ball" after each
"drive." But the most serious of all are
the players themselves. They greet their
friends with curt little nods, and if per
chance some one speaks within several
yards of them they frown and say "shoo."
Golf is certainly a very serious thing.
To-day, the first really fine day of this
week of sports, found a big crowd at the.
beach. The water here is very cold, but
that did not frighten the intrepid swim
mers, and there were many more bathers
than usuaL Mrs. Henry T. Scott and the
Princess Poniatowski early sought Â¦ the
luxury of a dip in the briny, but they are
careful swimmers and did not go far from
the rope. The Princess, who is extra pre
cautious, wore a life preserver collar
fashion round her neck. Mary Eyre, who
also is very prudent, wore the latest pre
servers, a pair of wings; Will Crocker
lost his pained and troubled look in the
water, and in sportive mood assumed with
ar rare, grace many gladiatorial attitudes
while he splashed recklessly about.
Mrs. Walter Hobart, Miss Collier, Mr.
Eyre and Miss Eyre brought their golf,
balls with them irito the water and en
joyed the two-fold pleasureâ a game of
handball and a swim.
Miss Marie Wells, who came down last
evening-, easily and immediately estab
lished herself as the beauty and most dar
ing swimmer at the beach. Miss Wells
swam Â¦Â¦ way. out beyond the raft. Her
bathing suit of gray edged with White

festive pleasantries at the game. The

saying "$5 for you" and repeating it. like
a Winchester sputtering slugs.
All the fuss of the piece de deslstance
happened in the fourth inning. Eagan was
en the middle sack when Dunleavy hit a
hard one, running over first and- straight
toward second, but as the ball, was quick

attempt to score. Dunleavy was sus
pended between first and second. Eagan on
tiptoe, ready to go home . whenever the
play fastened on the other side of the dia
mond sufficiently long to give him a
chance to score. Dunleavy was finally
tagged near second, but Graves claimed
that Croll, who was brought Into the
combination play, tripped him and so he
called Dunleavy safe. While Graves was
watching Dunleavy three or four Dudes
on the third base line would start home
every other second to bewilder the Angels
at work between first and second. This
furnished Morley with his first kick. The
second was for calling Dunleavy safe.

After discharging the Fremont "will go
Into retirement, and neither Captain Kel
ton nor his men will be heard from again
until next spring. In the meantime the
catch made by the barkentine of 177,003
fish will be a hard one -to beat for""years
to come. .
Prior to 1S77 the Fremont was a side
wheel steamer and ran between San Fran
cisco and Panama. She was called "pala
tial" in those days, but soon grew too
small for the trade. She was sold at auc
tion and Lynda & Hough of San Fran
cisco were the purchasers. That firm tore
her down to the lower frame. The en
gines and 'machinery were sold to other
parties and nothing of the Fremont was
left but a solid teak foundation. On that
the Fremont of to-day was built, and
now, after twenty-four years of service,
she is as tight and seaworthy as the day
she was first built. The Lynde & Hough
Company still own the vessel and think
as much of he.* as they did of the Jane
A. Kalkenberg-, lost under unusual circum
stances over a year ago. She was, caught
in a terrific storm off Flattery and' was ;
abandoned by the crew. Later she was
picked up and towed into Puget Sound.
Captain M. G. Kelton says that
her record of 5,000,000 fish caught during
the last twenty-four years cannot be beat
en on this coast. In actual figures, the
Fremont has landed in San Francisco
5.54G.000 codfish. These were all taken on
the Alaskan banks since 1S77, when the
barkentine "went Into commission. -
THE barkentine Fremont is the ban
ner ship of the eodfishlng fleet.
She is new discharging a cargo of
177,000 flsh at California City, and
For Samoaâ 41 cs canned goods, 30 cs sal

Lane also advises the Board of Works
that the eight-hour labor clause in the
charter governing city work is valid.
In answer to the Inquiry of the Board
of Supervisors respecting the steps neces
sary on the part of the city to annul the
contract with Gray Bros., street contrac
tors. Lane advises that if the firm is vio
lating the eight-hour provision of the
charter the contract should be treated as
void by act of the contractors, and a re
port of this conclusion made to the Board
of Public Works and the Auditor. -As the
charter does not state that a breach of
the contract will work a forfeiture thera
i? no other way of enforcing compliance
with such provisions as are therein con
tained except by treating: their breach as
a dissolution of the contract.
The Civil Service Commission has no
control over the extra employes author
ized by the Board of Supervisors to be
employed in county offices, according to
an opinion rendered yesterday by City
Attorney Lane. Such offices have the ap
pointment of their regular deputies free
from civil service rules. If they are al
lowed an additional deputy such deputy
would be appointed without reference to
civil service rules.
Regarding the Extra Deputies
in County Offices.
City Attorney Benders an Opinion
BARKEXTINK; FREMONT THAT HAS MADE A NEW RECORD THIS SEASON FOR THE CODFISHING FLEET.
DURING HER TERM OF SERVICE IN BERING SEA SHE HAS BROUGHT OVER FIVE MILLION FISH TO
SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE LYNDE & HOUGH COMPANY. '. '
CIVIL SERVICE BOARD
HAS NO JURISDICTION
And so. Gentlemen. I rejoice in thla crpat
decision of the Supremo Court that the framers
of the constitution must have intended that
this country shouM not come forth born as a
cripple into the family of nations, but ths>t
she should possess all the essential attributes
of sovereignty- which would enable her to
govern her . possessions according to the host
interests of the American people and subject
only to thoFC prohibitive provisions of the con
stitution' which guarantee protection against
Interference vrlth natural rights.
One â¢ hundred years ago the Supreme Court
of the United States said that contempora
neous construction, especially when long ac
qulescrd in,. was very strons, if not controlling,
with reference to the provisions of the con
stitution. In Insurance Company vs. Cauler.
Chief- Justice Marshall expressly left open the
question whether any act of Congress was
necessary to incorporate the inhabitants of
newly acquired, territory. For 100 years we
have acted upon the theory that such act of
Conprress was necessary, that the imposition
of different rates of duty was not in violation
of ,tha constitution, and In our Civil War we
stamper] out the heresy that the constitution
followed the flac. . * ;
From the time of the Louisiana purchase," In
1803, down to the treaty of Spain in 189S. the
treaty-making power of the Government has
exercised* the right to deal as it saw nr^with
the status of the inhabitants of ceded terri
tory, and. as Justice Brown says in his opinion,
the statutes passed in pursuance of the "Louis
iana purchase show the view'of Congress that
a discrimination "in favor of foreign vessels
trading with the ports of a newly acquired ter
ritory is^ no violation of the clause of the
constitution that declares that no preference
shall be given to the ports of one State over
those of another. The same practical con
struction was put upon the constitution in the
case of the purchase of Florida and in the an
nexation of Hawaii.
â¢The annual dinner to-night was attend
ed by most of the members of the associa
tion in the city. A large number ol toa3t3
were responded to. W. U. Hensel of Penn
sylvania was toastmaster. The most nota
ble" response was by Judge William K.
Townsend of the United States District
Court, New Haven, Conn., who originally
decided the Porto' Rican tariff cases, the
decision on which by the Supreme Court
has caused so much comment. He said in
part:
The action of the general council favor-
Ing a constitutional amendment admitting
women to membership was indorsed. After
a brief address by President-elect Rose
the convention adjourned sine die.' The

cided that the next meeting of the asso

"' DENVER, Aug. 23.â The American Bar
Association concluded the business of the
main .. organization at to-day's session.
The educational branch held a meeting
this afternoon, and the annual dinner was
given at the Brown Palace Hotel to-night.
The. general council reported the nomina
tions-this niorning-and all the nominees
were unanimously elected. They are as
follows: Â¦ '- - .
The 6trlke. however, rendered the pres
ence of the officer imperative in another
section of the city and several days ago
he was removed. The cottage was left
unwatched once more and the firebugr was
not slow to take advantage of that fact.
He visited the place yesterday morning
about 4:30 o'clock and started a blase,
â¢which with the aid of a little coal oil
eoon destroyed the structure.
The bulldingr has not been kept in a
habitable condition by its owner for sev
eral years and it is not a serious loss to
the neighborhood. Its destruction is rather
a relief as the neighbors feared that some
one of the many fires started In Â»it might
cause a general conflagration.
The Fire Department has been called
out so many times to extinguish blazes
discovered m the cottage that Fire Mar
shal Towe had a policeman armed with a
ehotg-un detailed to watch the place. Â£5x
weeks ago was the occasion of the fifth
blaze and up to within a few days ago an
officer has been stationed in the cellar of
the old building watching in vain for the
reappearance of the incendiary. The pres
ence of the officer was evidently known
to the person or persons interested in the
destruction of the ramshackle affair, for
no attempts were made to apply the torch
while he was on watch.
The sixth attempt made by firebugs to
destroy the unoccupied Price cottage,
Â¦which for u. number of years has stood
on Manchester street off Folsom on the
Bernal Heights, proved a success. All
that now remains of the building is a
mass of cinders.

.'Â¦Poffoot- Health
Is : within the reach of almost every
woman. The weakness, nervousness
and irritability from which so many
women suffer is in general due to dis-
ease of the delicate womanly organism.
When the disease 'is cured the general
health.is re-established.'
; Doctor Fierce's Favorite Prescription
makes weak . women strong and sick
women - .well. â¢ It ' promotes regularity,
dries disagreeable and enfeebling drains,
heals inflammation and ulceration and
cures female weakness. When these
diseases arc cured, headache, backache,
nervousness and weakness are cured also.
| Â«I was very weak and nervous when I com-
menced taking Dr. Pieree's Favorite Prescrip-
' tion and 'Golden Medical Discovery,' about a
year ago," writes Mrs. M. E. Everetts, of 89
.Oxford Street. Woodstock, Ont. "I had been
suffering for seven longf months, and had taken
medicine, from a : physician all the time, but it
â¢seemed -"to make me- feel much worse.". My.
stomach was so bad (so my doctor told me), and
my 'nerves were in such a state that I would :
start' at- the least, noise. _ I felt irritable at all
times ; was not able to do any of my own house-
work ;lhad to keep help all the time. -How I
suffered God and myself alone know. I was
greatly discouraged when ' I commenced taking
vour.medicii* â¢"â¢Â¦Â». but the first bottle seemed to
help me. /- 1 took five bottles of -.' Favorite Pre-
scription,' two of â¢ Golden ' Medical Discovery,'
also two vials of - Dr.' Pierte's Pleasapt Pellets.

which is certain death to them. They will
flee in terror from it and\ never appear
again where it has been placed. It also
has the great advantage of being perfect
ly harmless to human beings, hence there
is no danger from poisoning. The borax
should be pulverized and sprinkled about
the infested places. Paris green will ex
terminate, cockroaches, but Jt should be
used with great caution, as it is very pois
onous. '

LUXEMBERGâ H. T., Cleone, Cal.
Luxemburg is not under the control of
Emperor Wilhelm or the German Govern
ment. It is a grand duchy of Europe that
Is governed under a special constitution
by the King of the Netherlands.
VIRGINIA has on. hand a constitutional con
vention engaged in framing a new fundamental
law for the State. The present constitution
was the product of reconstruction times following
the. Civil War, though it was the work of the Vir
ginia people, aided by such immigrants as Gilbert C.
Walker, who became Governor of the State. . Doubt
less if fails to be a perfect instrument and is /sus
ceptible of improvement, and doubtless it will not be
as. much improved upon as it might or ought to be.
One pr6position made by the convention will at
tract general attention. It is to declare the instru
ment -it frames to be the constitution of Virginia
without submitting it to a vote of the people. We
are not aware that this has ever been done before in
any American State. The direct interest of* the
people in their fundamental law has been universally
recognized, and no State constitution has been put
in force without the expressed will of the people who
were to live under it. â¢
The direct power of the people over their funda
mental hiw has been affirmed in notable instances.
In apology" for this proposed Virginia plan it is noted
that the present constitution does; not provide that a
new instrument to supplant it shall be\ submitted to
the .people. It is doubtful, however, if such omis
sion can deprive the people of a primitive right;
\ .The old of New, York' declared its own
perpetuity. But the people, disregarding the attempt
of one.generation of citizens to limit; the rights of
another,- called a convention ami piadea new .con-,
stitution.-i This affirmation of the indestructibility of
a primitive right necessary to civil liberty has
regarded as a precedent: , ' ; ;\.,
It is passing strange that the -Democratic party of
Virginia, which last year, indorsed 'a platform which
declared for the ; initiative and referendum, and the
reference of all statutes ; to direct vote of the" people,
should now. propose : to .deny to the ,' people the high
est form of the referendum. by" forbidding their action'
upon a constitution' which is' the source and founda
tion of all statute law. '

The professors of the University of Chicago assert
they did not say the foolish things attributed to them,

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
PERSONAL MENTION.
Despite the emphatic manner in which h&'asserts
the coming growth of Canada and the advantages in
the way of virgin soil which the Dominion offers to
settlers, the Canadian statesman does not fail to see
the disadvantage' which confronts the Canadian in
the way of a lack of markets when compared with the
magnificent home market possessed by the" farmer in
the United States. -- His plea therefore/is for reci
procity. Of the alternative propositionâannexa
tion â he says: "To the American mind the question
of annexation, when considering Canadian niatters;1is
generally in view, and the advantages to be derived
from commercial and political union seem to him to
be so obvious that surprise is felt that the ? Canadian
does not see the matter in the same light. The Amer
ican realizes the advantages that. have been derived
fronl : ""restricted free trade between all the (States of
the American Union- since the constitution ; was
It is clear that by her connection with Great Britain
instead of with the United States, Canada is handi
capped in many ways. While every section of this
country is progressing by leaps and bounds, the older
provinces of the Dominion lag behind and make
comparatively little giowth. The only cheering re
sult they have obtained from the census is a demon
stration of the growth of the Western provinces,
where a considerable number of American farmers
and cattlemen have settled. From that fact they are
drawing the conclusion that the tide of migration be
tween Canada and the United States, is on the. turn,
and that hereafter more Americans will migrate to
the Dominion than Canadians to this country.
__One of the more hopeful of the Canadian states
men, the Hon. John Charlton, member of Parliament
and of the Anglo-American Joint High Commission,
has recently declared a conviction that the disparity
now existing between the two countries will rapidly
diminish in the future. He says: "In the Canadian
Northwest is situated the.greatest undeveloped wheat
region of the world, where at least 250,000,000 acres
are adapted to the growth of that cereal and where
only 2,000,000 acres are now under cultivation. Al
ready the tide of immigration has begun to flow into
this region from the United States, and the move
ment must rapidly gain momentum, for Canada alone
possesses great stretches of virgin soil inviting, the
occupation of the pioneer settler." . ,
The census does not, show that drift of population
toward large cities which is so marked a characteristic
of the development of the United States and of the
principal countries of Europe. In Canada the largest
city is Montreal, with a population of 266,826.
Toronto has 207,971. No other city in the Dominion
has a population reaching 100,000," and only three-
Quebec, Ottawa and Hamilton â have populations ex
ceeding 50,000. The increase of population has not
been so .large as sanguine Canadians expected,' and
their attention is once more directed to the emigra
tion of young Canadians to the United States. '
BY the first official bulletin of the Canadian
census, it appears the total population of the
Dominion is 5,338,883, an increase of 505.644
over the census of 1S91. The population of the prov
inces is as follows: British Columbia, 190,000; Mani
toba, 246,464; New Brunswick, 331,093; Nova Scotia,
459,116; Ontario, 2,167,979; Prince Edward Island,
103.258; Quebec, 1,620,974; Territories, 145,000; un
organized Territories, 75,000.
CANADA AND HER TRADE.
The military authorities, as we have said, are al
ready on the lookout for a new site. It is gratifying
that it is so, and it is to be hoped they will not con
tent themselves with a temporary expedient. The
Pacific is to be the scene of great military as well as
commercial activity in the future, and in the course
of ye^rs the number of soldiers who are to be buried
here will be very large. Therefore the new national
cemetery should be planned on . a spacious scale,
worthy of the nation and of its army. The Presidio,
however, is not the place for it. That is for the liv
ing, not for the dead. r'-.V-:
The issue is one that should be at once called to
the attention of the authorities at Washington. Two
years is not a long time, and Governments move
slowly. If when the present cemetery ground at the
Presidio is filled there be not another cemetery pro
vided there is danger that an easy way out of the
situation may be found by adding a few acres more to
the site now occupied. Against that danger we must
guard.
It is evident that the republic needs on this coast
a large and spacious national cemetery wherein to
lay the bodies of her soldiers who die in her service.
That cemetery, however, should not be within the
limits of San Francisco nor of any other city. The
civilized world has now advanced so far in science
as to perceive that serious evils result from the burial
of the dead near the homes of the living. We have
found it necessary to take steps to prevent further
burials in the local cemeteries that are under control
of the city authorities, and every argument that was
validvin support of that action is equally valid against
the establishment of a large national cemetery at the
Presidio.
SAN FRANCISCO has a good deal of interest
in the National Cemetery at the Presidio.
The ground set apart for the burial of the dead
at the reservation is rapidly filling up. The site con
tains fifteen and a half acres, and 3250 former sol
diers are lying there in their last sleep. It is esti
mated that vvithin two years there will be room for
no more, and the army authorities are already con
sidering where they shall look for additional bury-'
ing ground.

.- 1 Into 2 equals 2. â¢ . â¢
This means that 2 is twice greater than 1. Any sane man
will admit that. It follows that it is necessary to use the same
-process to determine how much greater is four-fourths than
three-fourths. In short, divide thus:
3-4ths into 4-4ths equals 1 1-3.
Represent the process in decimals, thus:
.75 into 1.00 equals 1.331-3. ,Â»"

Since none can see the flaws in his own solution of thÂ«
Prâ¢,* 1^ 11 * seems as lf X he xnatter mus * be submitted to the
United States Supreme Court, with instructions to apply the
new constitution-making power to arithmetic. d PP'y me
The following: argument Is that of a newspaper writer:
To. find how much greater four-fourths Is than three
fourths, it is necessary, to return to first principles. If you
want to know how much greater 2 is than 1, you divide thus
2 divided by 1 equals 2. â¢ V : '
a divided by 3a equals l-3d.
The secant! figures were submitted to the first expert, who
said he could see readily enough how tha other's mistake had
been made. >-^i . â¢
A banker proved. that four-fourths was one-fourth greater
than three-fourths by simple subtraction, thus:
4-4ths minus 3-4ths equals l-4th.
Proof: 3-4ths plus l-4th equals 4-4ths.
Nobody can question the accuracy of the above figures.
However, here is a computation by a professor of mathemat
ics that proves just as conclusively that four-fourths Is one
third greater than three-fourths:
3a plus a equals 4a.
"You don't need to prove it," said the expert accountant.
"If you have three quarters and I give you one quarter, then
you have four quarters, or a dollar. Any one can see that.
That proves that four-fourths is one-fourth greater than three
fourths."
"How do you prove it?" he was asked.

. But if the books of the Clearing-house should by any pos
sible chance get tangled up because of some error in arithme
tic perhaps another expert accountant might be sent over to
show the employes of the Clearing-house where they had made
a mistake. Desiring to get the latter' s figures O. K.'d by the
expert, the reporter went 'to the office of the latter and asked
him, "How much greater is four-fourths than three-fourths?"
"Why, one-fourth greater, of course," with a look at the
reporter.
HOW much greater than three-fourths is four-fourths?
This is not a joke; it is a very serious problem.
Indeed, it is so very serious -that a duel is to be
fought at Saranac Lake to settle the question. A re
porter who went about New York asking per
sons to solve the example started so many fierce disputes and
prospective flst fights that in the interests of public peace and
quiet it seemed best to quit. â¢
"Oh, that's easy," some men said. But it is not easy.
An army officer decided that four-fourths was one-fourth
greater than three-fourths, and now he will have to fight with
pistols at thirty paces to prove it.
In the belief that the best practical mathematicians are
found in business life, a reporter went to the head center, the
Clearing-house-, to put a stop to the argument.
An official answered at once, "Why, of course four-fourths
is one-third greater than three-fourths."
He adds columns of six figures as readily as he adds coir
umns of one figure, "and ne ought to know what he is talking
about. This is the way he proves that four-fourths !s one
third larger than three-fourths:
4-4ths minus 3-4ths equals l-4th.
3-4ths divided by i-4th equals 3.1
l-4th is therefore l-3d of 3-4ths.
. 4-4ths is l-3d greater than-3-4ths Q. E. D.
Proof: 3-4ths plus (l-3d of 3-4ths) equals 4-4ths.
That, ought. to make it _perfectly, plain to everybody that
four-fourths is one-third greater than three-fourths. Â¦-!/ r \~-\ ,-

THAT IS JUST NOW AGITATING THE WHOLE COUNTRY
DR. IMMANUEL PFEIFFER of Boston, who several
days ago finished a thirty days\_fast, during which he
ate nothing and drank only water, declares he did not
have the least unpleasant feeling during the month he
went without food, and that he slept every night. He
undertook the fast in the interest of science and made notes
of his condition from day to day. He lost twenty-six pounds.
For hjs first meal Dr. Pfeiffer had two plates of soup, con-
slating- of boiled barley, squash and potatoes, six poached
eggs, six slices of whole wheat bread, three baked potatoes,
two ears of corn and a pint of raspberries with a pint of
cream. After eating: all this he did not feel as if he had had
more than a glas3 of water, and when a friend brought In
two sandwiches, three doughnuts, two pears, two peaches and
three plums he -disposed of the additional food without ex
periencing any sensation of having eaten much.

One of the lands in which the French have ex
pended a good deal of their efforts at imperialism is
Madagascar. Thus far, however, they have accom
plished little beyond the military conquest of the
country; There has been no French migration to the
island, and, indeed, the people seem to care very
little about profiting by the' acquisition their Gov
ernment has attained for them at such an expense
of blood and treasure. In order to make some profit
out of the venture it is now* proposed that French
soldiers after serving in thejsland shall be induced
to remain and take up landiC thus becoming perma
nent settlers, and as a means of furthering the scheme
French women are to be encouraged to emigrate to
become the wives of the settlers.
It is reported that the plan was originally recom
mended by General Gallieni, who is t in command at
Madagascar. Soldiers are sent to 'the island for a
three years' service, but all who will consent to take
lands and cultivate them are to be exempt from ser
vice in the ranks aftei two years. The soldier has
the right of selecting for his farm any vacant land he
chooses/and the Government feeds and clothes him
for a year just as if he were still serving with the
colors. The inducements have .been sufficient, it is
said, to bring about a considerable and
it is believed that many more would accept if only
wives could be furnishedas well as' farms. It is for
that reason the scheme for promoting an emigration
of women is under consideration.
It is difficult to discover a single good reason
for this imperial activity on-the part of the French.
Their country, so far from being over populated, is
actually falling behind the rest of Western Europe in
that respect. They have no surplus of workers clam
oring for land and the right to labor. They have no
money to spare, for they are deeply in debt and the
burden of taxation'is onerous upon every class in the
community. They have entered upon colonization
in Madagascar as in Cochin China, seemingly for no
other reason than that of a desire to emulate the
British. In the pursuit of that foolish policy they
have unjustly waged war upon the natives of Mada
gascar and China, have forced thousands of. .strong
young men" who are needed at home to follow the
flag in those far-off adventures, have bribed them to
consent to settle in those remote lands and are now
trying to induce French women to. follow the men.
It would be difficult to conceive to what greater ab
surdity imperialism could be carried, even were a
government in the hands of madmen.
FOR, years past the leaders of France have, been
perplexed by the stagnation of the population.
While British, Germans and Italians are multi
plying around them, the French make hardly any in
crease at. all; in numbers.. Some of their authorities
take such gloomy views": of the situation as to con
clude that the race" has no future, that it is dying out
and 'that the soil of France will pass Unto the hands
of a more fruitful people. Even while" confronting
such a. probability as that, however, the .modern
spirit of colonization and imperial aggrandizement
has so affected the French leaders that: it is now se
riously proposed to' encourage the emigration of the
people and thus further diminish the population at
home. I
A FOOLISH IMPERIALISM.

Our members of Congress would be rendering
their State good service if they would communicate
at once with the Interior Department upon this sub
ject, urgently requesting withdrawal of all timber
land from entry by scrip or otherwise.
This is, a pressing matter. It is easily seen that if
scrippers :have their way in a brief time there will be
no forest to reserve, for all will have passed into pri
vate ownership with no restraint upon its final ex- ;
tinction.
The law could easily provide trained foresters to
supervise such lands, just as the laws of Maryland
and Virginia provide experts to compel the owners
or lessees of oyster beds to respect the necessities
of reproduction in the use of their property.
We make this suggestion for the eye of the Secre
tary of the Interior in the hope that existing law will
permit the withdrawal of all forest land from entry
at once, or that in default of such' authority it
will be conferred upon him by Congress at the com
ing session. Any one who has passed part of this
summer in the mountains of California will appre
ciate-the dire and distressing need of doing some
thing, and all that State and nation can do, to pre
serve, protect and care for the timber that we have
left. The fires have been awfully destructive. They
have swept public and private lands indiscriminately.
They have started in lumbered sections, on railroad
right of way, from the recklessness of tramps and
campers, and the sheer deviltry of forest incendiaries.
In some sections they have, by destruction of build
ings, admonished residents and settlers of their in
terest in preventing forest arson, and everywhere
they have pitifully stricken and wantonly wasted the
State's most precious endowment. It will be seen
that when forest land passes into private ownership
under such regulations as we have suggested, with
forfeiture of title as to the penalty of their non
observance, every forest owner under such condi
tions becomes a forest warden, for his own interest
guarding growing timber from harm.
The Federal Government' should withdraw all
forest land still on the public domain from entry and
private ownership. Enough has passed : now by
patent to materially deplete the timbered area of the
country, and not another acre should pass out of
Government 'control until the law regulates its. use
so. as to preserve it as forest land and. forfeit the
patent for violation of the regulations. Henceforth
every man who buys timber land should be subject
to official and expert oversight in harvesting the mer
chantable timber. He should be compelled to leave
standing all trees below a certain diameter, and to
clear the limbs and refuse of* his cutting so as to
safeguard against. fire. â¢
.This is a great inequality and a greater error/in
asmuch as- it is a capital error to permit any timber
filing at all. .
THE Record-Union says that one man filed scrip
on 2000 acres of fine timber at the Sacramento
Land Office last week, and remarks that this
is a commentary on our land laws, which permit one
man able to buy scrip to file on unlimited acreage of
timber while a man who is without money to secure
scrip is limited to a quarter section and submits to a
soul-searching ipvestigation as to his intention to
live on the land.

INTERESTING LECTURE
BY WAR CORRESPONDENT
The railroad brought action against
other persons at the time of the robbery,
but the grand Jury failed to Indict. The
statement of Hugh Kelley throws new
light upon the crime.
On cross-examination Hugh Kelley
would not state in fact that the money
was derived hy robbery, . but assumed as
much. He said he knew of the theft of the
aforementioned sum, and that most of it
was In $5 gold pieces, the same as he
found at the spot Indicated by his broth
er. He further declared that the money
was changed into $20 pieces before being
put into circulation. He received $S00 for
digging up the money and putting it into
possession of his brother.
CARSON. Aug. 23.â The case of Hugh
Kelley versus Joseph Kelley for the dis
solution of partnership came before the
District Court to-day. Hugh Kelley, the
plaintiff in the case, made startling alle
gations in his complaint, intimating that
the money used in establishing the firm
came from a robbery which occurred in
this city in 1S94, whereby the Virginia and
Truckee Railroad Company lost $3700. He
further intimates that he dug up $1500
from the ground in a stable indicated by
his brother and that this money was

THE "Woman's Home Missionary
Society of the California Confer
ence closed its twelfth annual
session yesterday at the Central
. â¢ Methodist Episcopal Church. It
was ' the most successful gathering ever
held by the society. Nearly one hundred
delegates were present from~ various
parts of the State. The convention was
presided over by the president of the con
ference board, Mrs. E. D. Bovard. The
sessions began on Thursday,' and many in
teresting papers relating to the mission
ary work of the society were read.
The proceeds of the celebration will be
applied: to the fund now being accumu
lated for the purpose of building a hall
for the use of the Irish societies of this
city. It is hoped that the returns will be
sufficient to make a first 'payment on a
lot on which an option has been secured.
A new sub-committee was appointed,
cojisisting of Thomas Seerey, T. J. Mel
lott and P. J. Kelleher, to arrange for the
night . display of fireworks. To P. Mc-
Gushin was entrusted the selection of
committees to assist him in managing the
grand ball at night.
A band of union Irish musicians drawn
from the talent of the city most familiar
with Irish airs will render the music for
the day. -Outside of American national
airs, naught but Irish music will be play
ed. There will be dancing during the day
and a grand ball will follow Hhe fire
works display at night. Colonel Thomas
F. Barry, the president of the Celtic Un
ion, will deliver the address during the
literary exercises. A competitive essay
and poem, both of v/hich must be writ
ten in Gaelic, will be read by the authors
who desire to compete for the gold medal
offered for the best.
A revival of the ancient Gaelic games
will, be one of the features of the day.
Throwing the hammer, putting the stone,
jumping, vaulting, standing kick, hurling
and Gaelic football, conducted strictly ac
cording to the rules obtaining in Ireland,
will form a portion of the athletic con
tests. Dancing for prizes to the weird
music of the fife and fiddle will give the
old and young an opportunity to display
their proficiency in three, four and eight
handed Irish reels and jigs. Professors
O'Connor and Kelleher have this branch
of; the programme in hand and have ar
ranged for the rehearsal of possible com
petitors on Sunday next at Hibernia Hall,
and on the following Sunday a full dress
rehearsal will be held at K. R. B. Hall,
1133 Mission street, when music and
speeches will afford all an opportunity to
spend a pleasant afternoon.
Gien Park has been chosen as the scene
of the demonstration and a day and night
celebration has been decided upon. Ar
rangements have been made with the
Market-street Railway Company and the
San Francisco and San Mateo Electric
Company for a special car service both
night and day, so that all who attend
will find plenty of accommodation both
going and returning.
Every preparation is being made by the
representatives of the Irish societies em
braced within the Celtic Union to make
the coming celebration on September 9
one to be long remembered. . Committees
are holding meetings daily and are en
listing the support of every one whom it
is thought can contribute a worthy,, fea
ture to the programme of the day. Re
ports from sub-committees read at the
meeting of the executive committee" held
last night in. the office of Colonel T. F,
Earry indicated a most satisfactory prog
ress. ' ?:
Schools were established and In 1854 the
congregation had so increased that the
building of a larger church on Mission
street became necessary. The present
church edifice Is one of the handsomest Jn
the city and -was recently refitted at a
cost of several thousand dollars.
Father Maginnis was regularly appoint
ed pastor In December of the same year.
In March, 1S52, San Francisco was divided
by the Bishop Into two districts, St. Pat
rick's being one of them and embracing
all the territory lying between Pine street
and Mission Creek, Johnson street, now
Ninth, and Larkin street and San Fran
cisco Bay.
The story of the early days of St. Pat
rick's is told in the parish records, which
have been carefully kept by Father Ma
ginnis. He arrived in San Francisco In
1S51 and was the only priest in the city
who preached in the English language.
He was given temporary charge of the
district known as Happy Valley by the
Right Rev. J. S. Alemany, then Bishop
of Monterey. In the latter part of June,
1851, Bishop Alemany received from John
Sullivan, Timothy Murphy and Jasper
O'F-arrell a piece of land. This land Is
the present site of the Palace Hotel, and
here the first St. Patrick's Church was
erected.
At the offertory "Jubilate Deo," by
Dudley Buck, will be sung. The music will
be under the direction of the organist,
Miss Mary Short, and Choir Director Da
vis. In the evening Lejeal's vespers Â¦will
be sung; "O Salutaris," by George Curtl;
Rigo's "Tantum Ergo," and Lambelotte's

by an augmented choir with organ and
orchestral accompaniment. The singers
will be as follows:
The priests and people of St. Patrick's
parish will to-morrow celebrate the fif
tieth anniversary of the parish and of the
opening of its first church. â¢ Solemn serv
ices will be held at 11 o'clock. The Most
Rev. Archbishop will be present and the
attendance of a large number of priests
is expected. Bishop Montgomery of Los
Angeles will preach In the morning and
Rev. P. E. Mulligan will deliver the ser
mon after vespers.
One of the most Impressive services of
the sessions of the convention will be
conducted at the foot of the "Prayer
Book Cross." in Golden Gate Park, when
the delegates will be impressed with the
important historical fact that the first
service of the Anglican church was
held within sight of where the cross
Ftands on the 24th day of June, A. D.
-579, by a chaplain of the fleet commanded
by the famous admiral and freebooter,
Francis Drake, a generation before James
town, in Virginia, which has hertofore
claimed the honor, was even thought of.
A problem which the entire force of
Bishops, priests and laymen of the church
in the United States may be unable to
solve is presented in the Hawaiian Isl
ands, where an Anglican Bishop Is en
throned. Bishop Willis, who has succeed
ed in making himself obnoxious by his au
tocratic ways of ruling his church, has
alienated not only English but American
members of the church. His stipend has
been withdrawn by the Archbishop of
Canterbury, on the ground that the isl
ands is a province of the church in Amer
ica, and to this view the Episcopal church
assents and is willing to take care of Ha
waii, provided it has a controlling voice
as to ways and means. The dlfflculty
would be solved by the resignation of the
Anglican Bishop, when the Island diocese
would probably become a province under
the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Califor
nia; or, if the future growth of the
church justified, a separate diocese by It
self.
The Ha-sraiian Problem.
The committee to report a. body of can
ons establishing courts of appeal, of
which the Chief Justice of the United
States is one, has formulated an exceed
ingly able report on the subject, and if
adopted will remedy a crying evil in the
church. Rarely a Bishop is disposed to be
tyrannical in his treatment of his subor
dinates if not autocratic. The new canon
Â¦win remedy that.
The reiwrt of the committee on a. re
vision of canons includes the one on the
establishment of the "provincial system"
of the church, which divides the whole
church into parts, including one or more
States, with primate and clerical and lay
associates with power for legislation with
in the province. The growth of the
church and the difficulty of managing- the
affairs of all the dioceses at a general
convention meeting but once in three
years favors the plan, though the change
may be many years distant.
The convention of 1901 may be notable
for its action relative to the new respon
sibilities thrust upon It by reason of ad
ditions to the territory of the United
States incident to the war with Spain.
The Phlippines, Cuba and Porto Rico, in
the opinion of many, ought to have Bish
ops and diocesenal functions of their won.
The action of the convention will depend
upon the liberality of the wealthy lay
men.
Court of Appeals.
The proposed canon also extends the de
grees of consanguinity and affinity, which
may act as Impediments to marriage.
The great debate of the convention is ex
pected on the vote on the adoption of this
canon. The ecclesiastics, almost to a
man, favor it, but the laity pjb divided
as to the expediency of the proposed leg
islation.
No minister 6ha.ll solemnize a marriage be
tween any two persons until by inquiry he
Fhall have satisfied himself that neither per
son has been, or is, the husband or wife of
any other person then living; unless the former
marriage was annulled by a decree of some
civil court of competent jurisdiction for cause
existing before euch former marriage.
The eyes of the whole country will be
turned upon the San Francisco conven
tion, watching for its action upon the
proposed canon on marriage and divorce.
Heretofore the church has allowed its
priests to remarry the innocent party to
a divorce procured on scriptural grounds,
but the proposed new canon prohibits re
marriage for either party. It is as fol
lows.
The Triennial Convention of the Protest

CHICAGO.' Aug. 23.â Trade in wheat lacked
even a suspicion ' of animation. , : . The market
opened 1 easy Ton disappointing cables, Septem
ber. %@%c down at 70' '.c. Selling for the out
side account . influenced a" small selling move
ment by the /bear- contingent. -When some 'of
them attempted to ' cover a : little Â¦ later 'â¢ the
market suddenly ran up to 70%c. : This proved
the best price of the day, , and there was
scarcely " a â¢ moment during the : remainder - of
the session when the early short sellers could
not have covered at a profit. 1 Outside llqulda
' ti jn and | the | corn weakness were bear factors
and September worked down to 70c. The close
was weak,- %c under yesterday at 70@70^4c " '
Corn gave an. exhibition of 'its dependence
upon - speculative support and ' showed ... how
inoufficient h an â¢ undoubtedly \ strong Â¦ situation
could:. be when; speculators; relax their. efforts
to boost prices. Â¦Â¦ The. feature, of* -the r day's
trade was. the large quantity. for sale on lout
side 'orders.' Heavy . Argentine . shipment â¢ was
a bear factor. : The close was weak, - Septem
ber ",4c lower at' C5Â©55%c. â¢ '.
The oats market Â¦Â¦ naturally turned weak in
sympathy with the corn - market.'. i Liquidation

Â¦ Trade ? In provisions was 7 moderately active
Prices at . the opening 'Â¦ were i, slightly Irregular
and; a- slight .decline /.followed -in sympathy
with the surrounding weakness. ' -During ithls
,tlme considerable lard was .sold.'i.-.-AVr better
cash demand, and: buy ins- by packers (caused a
Â¦ rally -j and Â¦; the close â¢ was ', firm, v January pork
Cotton goods have been rather Irregular, but
It is to be noted that . talk of a reduction" In
wages and a consequent strike in Fall River
has been practically abandoned. 'and the close
of the week finds Â¦.* print cloths < firmly - held."
Â¦whlle ,; other 'cotton goods are ' quite steady.
Wheat was weak early on increased supplies
afloat, enlarged receipts at the Northwest and
technical market ' conditions favoring a de
cline, but strengthened later on continued poor
crop reports from abroad, fairly large clear
ances, although " not equal ' to last week,' rtnd
general confidence in present or better prices
being maintained. Corn has sympathized
largely with wheat, though weakening- on Its
own account on better crop advices from . the
Stales east of the Mississippi, where timely
rains liave fallen., Net, changes A or the Lweek
are slight. Some-'hog products, particularly
lard, have . sympathized with the strength of
corn." .. .. Â¦ . 'Â¦Â¦-. .-:.. . " ,. Â¦ ... ::::, â¢ ., . ..
Evidence multiplies that the tide of trade
has turned and that it Is now setting strongly
in .the direction of an enlarged business' at
steady or higher prices. Crop improvement,
particularly in the Central West and -. : the
Mississippi Valley, has been the mainspring
of the more cheerful tone of advices and en
larged fall operations at such cities^ as Chi
cago, St. Louis and Kansas City. Even from
the so-called drought-stricken corn belt' ccme
advices of a quite satisfactory business, .'.in
some instances reports being -of a larger, job
bing trade than in the corresponding, period
a year . ago. , . The notable strength .' of . coUon,
partly, however, the result of real or assumed
crop damage, has" been the active feature in
the betterment of Southern trade advices. At
the great Eastern centers distribution is going
forward In as good, if not. better; volume than
a year -ago. - - , .
Prices, except for some irregularity, in the
cereals, have been generally quite steady.: ..-;

NEW YORK. Aug. 23. -The Wall-street dis
trict haa more appearance of animation to
day than for a long time past. The prolonged
and persistent resistance of the market to any
factors of degression and the continued scar
city of ftocks offering, notwithstanding the
very considerable advance in the levti of
prices during- the last two months, apparent
ly prompted the professional traders, as
though by a common impulse to inaugurate a
movement to put prices up. There was no
indication that the general public was taking
any part in the movement, the commission
houses continuing to complain of lack of busi
ness, but the professional operators at' work
made p'.ay with a freer hand than had been
the recent rale. There were no very large In
dividual transactions, but the number of 1000
thare lots was very conspicuous and well dis
tributed throughout the room. The dominant
speculation was in the Pacifies and South
weeterns. Union Pacific leading the railroad
list in point of strength and activity with an '
extreme rice of 2%. The so-called Gould
stocks were all active and strong, including
the Denver and Rio Grande stocks and the
Colorado and Southern stocks, the latter ap
parently on a supposition that developments
are Impending looking to its absorption into
the Gould system. Ihe grain-carrying roads
Si a whole were affected by the decided weak
ness in thÂ« curn market, indicating the recup
eration in the corn crop. The continued heavy
loreign demand for wheat, coupled with the
reported good condition ol that crop, was also
an' element. Amalgamated Copper was in
very large demand, notwithstanding the de
nials or reports that further absorption of
copper interests was intended and rose an ex
treme 2%. There was gossip of coming rights
on Baltimore and Ohio to subscribe to new
stock, tu^be issued in connection with th?
landing reorganization of Pittsburg and West
ern. ' The minor Steel stocks were strong-
Tenr.tEsc-e Coal rising 3Vi. The United States
feteel stocks opened a fraction higher and
were held almost immovable all day the ex
treme fluctuation hi each being ij^. There
were strong points among the minor railroads
and specialties jind the coalers continued to
ehow strength. The preliminary estimates
following cash chanres were apparently re
lied on as foreshadowiRg a strong bank state
ment to-morrow.
Tha railroad bond market shared in the
greater activity, and *trenrth of the stock
market, but speculative bonds were most con
spicuous. Total sales, par value. $2.SS5,000.
1,'r.lted States bends' were all unchanged on
the last call.

Bradstreet's on Trade.
The feeling that the strike/ would either be
called I'tt or collapsy affected ' not only the
steel stocks, but the railroad list as well.
In point of activity the stock market showed
but little improvement this week. It con
tinued to be narrow and In the main dull,
while professional trading and manipulation
by pool interests were apparently responsible
for most of the transactions. The tone bf\the
market was better, however, the change in
this respect becoming more apparent on Fri
day. Some slight Increase in the amount of
commission . orders accompanied this move
ment, though on the whole the public seems
to be still keeping out of Wall street, except
as investors, there being a steady demand tor
bonds and considerable absorption of dividend
paying stocks. ; The light offerings oT securi
ties constitute one of the features of the tltu
atlon. In fact, In the early part of this week
it was the absence of any pressure to sell
which maintained prices, even when buying
power was lacking. Operators have found
that the bear side ls now unprofitable and It
was noted that large Western interests, which
were active in depressing stocks for .some
time back, have now changed their position.
The large earnings which are reported by the
railroads, | as a rule, seem to have aided In
creating a belief that the damage to th? ccrn
crop will not have any serious effects on the
traffic and avenues of the roads, at least un
til October or . November,, when new corn
would begin to move. There has. therefore,
naturally been a reaction from the pessimistic
viewa which recently prevailed about crop
conditions, the large wheat exports and the
generally better reports from the .agricultural
States alcllns this tendency. The. situation as
regards the steel workers' strike also seemed
to take a bullish phase, though at the Â¦ be
ginning of the week' the success 6(. the
Amalgamated Association In inducing the men
at Jollet and Milwaukee to violate their con
tracts and Join in the strike caused renewed
uneasiness and some support from the Insid
ers was needed to keep the United " States
Steel stocks steady..

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been two arrivals of coal from Brit
ish Columbia. 7541 tons; four from Washington,
11.2S3 tons; one from Australia. 407S tons; ona
from New York. 844 tons; total, 23.744 tons.
The amount received this week Is about equal
to the quantity we would consume If all our
factories were running full blast. At the same
time It is somewhat in excess of our present
requirements. The steamers carrying coal from
British Columbia and Washington are making
much better time discharging than they did
several days ago, evidencing that there must
be some leaks among the union laborers or
their places arev being substituted by men
coming from the Interior. As most of the de
liveries of steam coal are off shore, very HttU
delay is being caused, as barges, etc.. are read
ily procurable. When our present labor dis
turbances are settled there will be no difficulty
in getting- fuel expeditiously shipped to meet
all our urgent requirements, as steamers arÂ»
utilized now entirely. Freight rates on coal
from Great Britain and Australia show a stif
fening tendency. TM3 would indicate that
those who purchased the early part o* this
month did so with advantage. It ls very
evident. Judging from the strong: feeling now
prevailing In the values of the largest oil pro
ducing wells, that better prices for their out
put will hereafter prevail, and consumers can
well afford to pay a reasonable advance 00
present ruling figures."

Grain quotations eased off somewhat during
the week, though ; the net decline was small.
Corn is still close to the highest price since
1892. even with a host of important Influences
militating against such ' inflated figures.
Weather conditions steadily improve, making
the putlook bright for late planted corn. For
eign customers have been driven away by ex
orbitant prices -to the benefit of Russia and
Argentina, and Atlantic exports for three
weeks aggregated only 1.862,589 bushels, against
7,636,548 bushels last year, and 12,720,027 bushels
two years "ago. Meanwhile, Interior receipts
steadily exceed those of a year ago. indicating
that farmers have large stocks carried over
from previous excessive yields. Nevertheless
prices remain above sixty cents. The slight re
action In wheat Is explained by the decrease in
Atlantic shipments to 4,833,735 bushels, against
7.352.Â£26 bushels In the previous week. Com
pared with the exports of 1,670,817 bushels last
year, and 2,798,887 bushels two years ago, how
ever, there appears a phenomenal sain. p - a
clfie exports are still retarded by labor troubles
and the movement will be striking once started.
Failures for the week number 203 In the
United States, against 171 last year, and thirty
five In Canada, against twenty-nine last year.
After a season of. dullness at eight cents a
pound, cotton suddenly developed considerable
animation and strength. The chief influence
was unsatisfactory weather in. Texas, although
there was also aid in the speculative market
from covering of . the larse short interest out
standing. Liverpool quickly responded to better
prices here. There was further support in the
failure of any agreement regarding wage reduc
tion at Fall River, as a strike would assuredly
have followed and consumption of the raw ma
terial been materially curtailed.. Decided inter
est is shown in fall goods, the fall trade being
well occupied. In lines exported to China there
Is a fair movement.
One of the most satisfactory signs is the evi
dence that little summer stocks will have to be
carried over. Sole leather continues remarkably
strong, union backs gaining another cent, while
there is a splendid demand for hemlock, both
for domestic use and export. , Belting advanced
and kangaroo leather Is much higher. Hides are
without chance In , price and selling freely.
Slightly better terms asked for staple woolen
and worsted poods In no way diminished the
volume of sales, and the lightweight season
promises to be one , of activity. In heavy
weights there is also noticed greater interest on
the part of buyers than Is customary at this
late date. These improved conditions in the
manufacture give a. tone to raw wool despite
the heavy arrivals at Eastern markets of the
new clip.
Exceptional activity is still the rule at shoe
shops and promises to continue \for some
months." ~ \. Â¦ Â¦ - . .. ;Â¦ N
The Amalgamated Association of Iron, . Steel
and Tin- Plate Workers succeeded in enlisting
the sympathy of other workmen,' with the re
sult that the output of merchant bar and wire
rods is curtailed to the extent of about 40,000
tons monthly. Beyond this defection, wage
earners in allied branches of the steel industry
have retused to break their contracts.- Many
idle mills resumed during the past week; and
even in the tin plate region there is a moderate
output. Plates have begun to- arrive Irom
abroad and prices in the London market sharp
ly advanced. Hood and sheet mills increased
production daily, and- there is no loss in the
rail division, but some anxiety is felt regard
ing supplies of cotton ties, as the picking sea
son has begun in many States.
i Except in certain branches of the textile mar
kets, sellers of merchandise have an advantage
over buyers and "distribution "is as ; large as
stocks will permit. -Â¦'- ':Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢ -
Â¦ Though there are some - drawbacks, notably
the labor troubles in the iron and steel industry,
businesses of well sustained volume, to which
fact payments v through the country's clearing
houses, railroad earnings and the strength of
prices of staple and . partly : manufactured
merchandise offer amale testimony. ,. '

NEW BATTERIES

Many of the members i of the Kappa
Kappa Gamma have arrived at the uni
versity and are already installed in their
new home. Up to the present they have
been busily engaged in the work which
the opening of a new college year makes
imperative, but In a short time they will
commence making it pleasant for, them
selves and those lucky enough to get
"Invites.". , . , .::â¢"... â¢' â¢ . ... ' ;
It is expected that In consequence of
this particular fraternity having such
handsome, modern and convenient quar
ters, a spirited . race for college - social
honors will be inaugurated and that its
functions, will be the most select at the
Mniversity. * ' . ; " . '
Just what social plans have been made
for the coming season by the Kappa
Kappa Gamma are not known, but it 'is
thought that they .will entertain 'more
extensively than the male students.
Needless to say, both the male and fe
male students are looking forward to
what promises to be the merriest and
most pleasant winter ever. spent by col
legians at Berkeley.
THE proudest co-eds attending the
university â¢ are the "â¢ members of
the Kappa Kappa Gamma Fra
ternity. They have every reason
to be proud, for they have com
pleted the work of reconstructing the
home of the society and now have one of
the prettiest and cosiest "frat houses"
in Berkeley.
ThiÂ» sorority Is the oldest organization
for young lady students connected with
the university. It has "mothered" the
scheme of securing quarters for the co
ed3 such as the young men enjoy and the
members have worked with such good
will that they were enabled to announce
yesterday that in the future they would
rival the efforts of the male students to
make the social side of college life an
attractive feature. . .
As penal statutes must be construed
strictly, I am unable to reach the con
clusion that the giving of prizes as a re

General Knox has rendered to the Post
master General an opinion on whether a
certain Western daily paper has violated
the law prohibiting the use of the mails
for advertising lotteries, gift concert and
similar enterprises. A paper some tlm*
ago announced a guessing contest, adver
tising that it would give 1300 prizes, ag
gregating $15,000 in value, to persons mak
ing the nearest estimates of the number
of paid admissions to the Pan-American
Exposition at Buffalo from the day of
opening to the day of closing.
The Attorney General says that until
practically forbidden by law the remedy
Is with Congress and not with the depart
ment. He says the contestants must go
Into careful inquiry as to "the facts about
the exposition, public interest and attend
ance to date, and continues as follows:
Such estimates, therefore, while neces
sarily dependent in many respects upon
chance, are likewise affected by the in
telligent calculations of a thoughtful ob
server. A fair construction of the worda
dependent upon lot or chance* excludes
estimates which are based upon mental
calculation, even though the factors
which enter into such calculation may be
uncertain and matters of conjecture. Tha
drawing of a lot or the throw of the dlÂ»
are purely dependent upon chance, for no
mental operation can aid in estimating
the result.
EL PASO, Aug. 23.â Jose Remedlos Val
despino, the leader of the Furioso gang of

Durango, Mexico, for several years, has
been killed in battle. He and a few of
his followers were overtaken by a squad
of rurales in the Canyon de Villalobo.

and after a fight that lasted over an hour
the chief was slain and several of hi3
men were killed and wounded. .
The record of Valdespino was one of the
bloodiest and most cruel in the history of
Northern Mexico. A number of years ago
he organized a small band of robbers and
began operations in the mountains. Min
ing prospectors, ranchmen and ore and
freight train, men perished as he met
them and their money and valuables were
appropriated by his crowd. Several
times the authorities have captured and
executed some of his men, but as often
he replenished his ranks and kept up tha
bloody work. Many ranches have been
raided and the women and children, as
well as men, were slain like dogs. Houses
were burned and property of every kind
was destroyed before the gang proceeded
on its way. ' ' I . â¢ Â¦
Last year the gang was almost broken
up, but Valdespino succeeded in escaping.
For several months nothing was heard of
him, but this summer he mustered an
other band of followers and began his
work again. Numerous posses of rurales
were sent on his trail, but he succeeded
in staying out of their path. About two
weeks ago he raided a wagon train and
killed several persons and the authorities
found his trail. For ten days they fol
lowed In close pursuit and one afternoon
of last week. overtook the outlaws in the
Canyon - de Villalobo. The fight was fu
rious and six soldiers were killed. After
a battle of over an hour the firing of the
soldiers was not returned, and on closer
approach dead men were found scattered
along the gulch. In this number was the
body of Valdespino, shot in several places.
Several of the party are thought to have
escaped, but nothing is feared from them
since their leader is dead. ' .

SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 23.â The most suc
cessful amateur play ever put on In this
city held the attention of a large audi
ence in Gordon's Opera-house this even
ing. The play was "Esmeralda," a four
act drama, and the talent was all local.
The entertainment was given for the ben
efit of the San Francisco Presbyterian
Orphanage and Farm. Society lent strong
aid to the venture and contributed its
share to the well-filled house that to
night greeted the local actors.
Among the ladies who patronized the
entertainment were Mrs. A. W. Foster,
Mrs. Henry Sonntag. Mrs. William Lich
tenberg. Mrs. Louis Sloss. Mrs. W. S.
Leake, Mrs. Vincent Neale. Mrs. Lewis
Gerstle. Mrs. W. G. Curtis. Mrs. J. Keck.
Miss Grace Fern, the well-known read
er and impersonator, directed the enter
tainment. For some weeks past she has
given her time and ability to teaching
the s young people how to act. To-night's
performance showed that her efforts were
attended by success. The^characters In
the play were represented as follows:
George Drew, speculator Mrs. Verdenal
Esterbrook. a rer.tleman of leisure. .J. O. Short
OH Man ltodsrers T. J. Crowley
Mr!. Rodeers Sirs. Renebome
EsmerAIda, the daughter Miss Grace Fern
Dave Hardy Edwin Halley
Jack Desmond, artist in Paris â :
Colonel S. Shakespeare
Norah Desmond Miss Sarah Bowne
Kate Desmond/. AlUs Ellen Stadtmuller
Marquis de Montessan Emelio Lastretto
All the players met deserved praise.
Miss Fern, with her ability and training,
set a high standard, and it Is no dispar
agement to the others to say that first
honors fell to her.
T. J. Crowley, who in time of peace is a
lawyer, made a splendid hit as Old Man
Rodgei-p. He could give away a daughter
to the true lover and muster up courage
enough to defy a spirited wife who was
bent on an alliance with a scheming Mar
quis. He did not overdo his part; his
hands and feet keep out of his way. If
law business ever runs shy the big foot
light celebrities would better look out for
a dangerous competitor.
Mr. Halley made a docile lover of Es
meralda. He did his best and it was
good. His part, all conditions considered,
was the most difficult in the play.
Colonel Shakespeare impersonated the
artist uncle well. The fatherly way that
he petted his pretty nieces, Kate and
Xorah. was good acting. And the nieces-.
Miss Bowne and Miss Â¦Stadtmuller, were
clever performers. Generous applause
was given to each.
Emelio Lastr^tto made a splendidly vil
lainous Marquis. He wanted the girl and
her money, and when these were denied
him he performed a convenient elopement
with another heiress.
The play was so well received to-night
that Jt will be repeated to-morrow - night,
and it is among the possibilities that It
may be given in San Francisco at a later
date.
Dividend, for Prune-Growers.
SAX JOSE, Aug. 23.â The first checks

Those for the first district will be com
pleted to-morrow, the second by Tuesday
end the third by Thursday next There

amount of clerical work is Involved. Sales
continue brisk and another dividend prob-
Bbly will be declared. Good green prunes

Furey 's Case Continued.
Edward Furey, the special officer at the
Risdon Iron Works charged with assault
to murder for shooting Peter Callahan,
a striker. on Wednesday evening,
and who was arrested and released on
$50 cash bail, was ordered into custody by
Judge Conlan yesterday morning. Furey
was detained in court till Dr. J. W. Sea
well of St. Luke's Hospital, who was at
tending Callahan, appeared and testified
that Callahan's condition was favorable
and there was no danger of serious re
sults. .The Judge thereupon allowed
Furey to go on his original bail, arid by
consent the. case was .continued till Mon
day.
A conference of independent antl ; boss
delegates to the Republican Municipal
Convention was held last evening at Na
tive Sons' Hall ' on Seventeenth street,
near Valencia. The Thirty-fourth, Thir
ty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth ' and
Forty-first districts were largely repre
sented. Among the delegates at the con
ference were: T. P. Woodward, president
of the Republican Primary League; Ed
mund Tauszky, Morgan Backus, J. C.
Currier, A. G. Towne, Lester Burnett,
George B. Keane, Clifford McClellan, L.
W. Buschard, Myer Jacobs, Ralph
Hathorn, F. W. Burnett, M. Cerf. A. C.
Rulofson and L. Haake. One hundred
and twenty-three delegates were repre
sented and large accessions v/ere prom
ised.
The conference . was not called in the
interest of any aspirant for public office
or any candidate for chairman of the
convention. When the delegates elected
to represent the Thirty-fourth District
organized a suggestion was made that
the Thirty-ninth delegation be invited to
a conference. Subsequently invitations
were extended to the Thirty-eighth, For
tieth and Forty-first, and each of these
district delegations appointed a commit
tee of five to attend the caucus.
Anti-Boss Element Is Strong.
A careful study of the various district
delegations had been made by active Re
publicans and the opinion was expressed
that the anti-boss, elements were strong
enough to dominate the convention. In
order to prevent the nomination of a
ticket dictated by the bosses concert of
action on the part of the independents
was considered essential. It is reported
that many, representative men of the
Thirty-third,. Thirty-fifth, Thirty-seventh
and Forty-second district delegations are
in sympathy with the plan to bring
about a union of all the anti-boss ele
ments of the convention.
At the conference last night ex-Senator
Burnett was chairman' and Clifford Ms-
Clellari secretary. There was a general
exchange of views and a free expression
of sentiments in favor, of a clean ticket
and a vigorous effort to achieve success at
the polls. Assurances given by -several
speakers that -the anti-boss forces were
strong enough to control the convention
awakened much enthusiasm.. ..There will
be another meeting of independent dele
gates Â¦ at Native Sons' Hall, on Seven
teenth street, " Friday evening Of next
week. In the meantime district delega
tions will meet and receive reports of the
conference held last night.
Webster's Ladylike Canvass.
Several candidates are in the field for
the office of Coroner. Dr. T. J. Crowley's
name is added to the Republican list. â¢ His
friends point to his record as a physician
and chemist while he was attached to the
City and County Hospital and St. Luke's
Hospital. ' -
Reports come from the labor camp that
Eugene E. Schmltz, president of the Mu
sicians' Union, will- not have a walkover
in the Labor party convention for the
Mayoralty nomination. There is likely to
be quite an "army, of aspirants for the
honor; of heading the ticket. It seems
settled that Charles Wesley Reed will not
figure conspicuously as a candidate in the
Labor party convention. .
Charles Jx Pattbrt, Charles S. liaumels
ter, "Judge Bahrs, Auditor Wells . and
Henry J. Crocker continue to be the lead-
Ing aspirants for Mayor In the Republican
camp. Superintendent of Schools R. H.
Webster is making a ladylike canvass ana
securing some promises of. support.
O. F. von Rhelri, ex-Supervisor, is added
to the list of Republican aspirants for the
office of Public Administrator:
Policeman Knight Will Appeal.
Police Officer Knight, who was con
victed by Judge Cabaniss of battery for
clubbing a striker, intends to ask for a
new trial on the ground of newly dis
covered evidence. This morning he is to
aprear before . Cabnniss for sentence.
Attorney Joseph Coffey, who represents
Knight, Is satisfied that a new trial will
be granted. ._...â¢
In case the. court refuses to set aside
the -former Judgment it* Is the intention
of Coffey to immediately take' an appeal
to the Superior Court. ' -,/.\

, Holabird.
CHICAGO, Aug. 23.â The honors In the
Western amateur golf championship tour
nament will probably go to a representa
tive of Detroit. ! Raymond Russell, - a
young player -who hails from that city,
upset all calculations at Midlothian this
afternoon by defeating W. . Holabird Jr.,
the idol of Glenview, by 3 up, 1 to play,
in the second round of the match play
for the championship cup. Three Chicago
men, Fred Hamlln, P. B. Hoyt and Bruc9
Smith, are all that stand between Rus
sell and the championship. '
RAYMOND RUSSELL PICKED
AS WESTERN CHAMPION
The only preliminary of the night was
between Philadelphia Tommy . Ryan and
Joe Cotton, colored, of California. Cot
ton was fearfully punished for ten
rounds, but stood up well under it, . and
Referee English called It a draw.
The only knockdown occurred about a
minute after the fight . started In the
first round, when Attell was tumbled
over from a straight right to the' jaw:
It was not the force of the blow that
floored him, but the suddenness of it
caught him off his balance. â¢ . -

DENVER, Aug. 23.â George DIxon, ex
featherwelght champion, and . Abe Attell
of San Francisco, bantam-weight cham
pion of the Pacific Coast, fought ten
rounds to a draw at Coliseum Hall here
to-night. Up to the last round the fight,
was principally a sparring contest. Only
once or twice did the men undertake, to
mix it up, and when they did neither had
the advantage. In the tenth, however,
they went at each other with a venge
ance, and in this round Dlxon appeared
to land two blows to Attell's one, usually
on the face and head. Several punches
on the jaw staggered the little Califor
nian. â¢ ; ' , -

was escaping fr,om the room occuoled by

The attention of Mr. Hays was called to
the recent Superior Court decision which
said that the Southern Pacific has no legal
right to run trains on a considerable por
tion of its Mission" tracks, never having
been granted a franchise for the same.
He was also informed that the application
for a franchise for, a second track now
before the Board of Supervisors would be
opposed by the people of the Mission and
defeated if possible.
-Mr. Hays in replying said that he had
already informed the rNew York office of
the situation in the Mission and would do
so again. He said that the construction
of a road over the Valencia-street hill
would be an undertaking of much expense
which should be avoided if pqssible. Mr.
Hays also callÂ«d the attention of the com
mittee to the proposed cut-off beginning
at San Bruno and. running through the
Polrero to Third and Townsend streets,
which is intended to take the place of the
present track _which the - Mission people
are objecting: to. He said that he would
recommend that the company give prece
dence in construction to this piece of
work. It is a Job of much magnitude,
however, and -will take at least two years
to complete after it has once been started.

On June IS The Call told of the pres
ence in this city of Joseph D. Redding,
XV. H. Mills and H. E. Huntington. Mr.
Redding had come from New York a
week before the Princess reached this
city and evidently knew of his client's
coming, as he went up the road to meet
the party. He was in constant consulta
tion with the Prince and Princess during
their stay, and also conferred with othÂ°r
interested parties. W. H. Mills, who
knows more about the estate of the late
Collis P. Huntington than any other man
living, arrived the preceding Saturday
from the Pan-American Exposition, and
the recent arrival on the coast of H. E.
Huntington was further evidence that a
settlement was in prospect.
Negotiations had been pending for
many months and now at last a settle
ment has been reached. By this compro
mise Princess Hatzfeldt is to receive $6 -
000.000. Of this amount the widow of the
late-railroad magnate is to contribute'$4,
000.000 and H. E. Huntington $2,000,000. As
was stated in these columns yesterday
the Prince and Princess have departed
for Europe well satisfied with the result
of their visit.
The fee to be paid Mr. Redding is eo
munificent that it has created no end of
talk in club circles. One well-known club
man said yesterday that he knew it as a
positive fact that this vast sum would be
paid over to the attorney just as soon as
the settlement had been consummated.
A Significant Coincidence.
Readers of The Call have been aware
that Princess Hatzfeldt contemplated
bringing Buit to recover a daughter's
share of the immense estate. It will be
remembered that by her foster father's
will the Princess was to receive $1,000,000
only. Dissatisfied with this small portion
of the estate, she came to California for
the purpose of '. securing documentary or
cumulative evidence of her adoption by
the late Collis P. Huntington.
Princess Hatzfeldt. accompanied by her
husband and a retinue of servants, ar
rived in this city on Sunday, June 16, and
took quarters at the Palace Hotel. Their
coming was unheralded and their entry
into the city would have been unnoticed
had not the Princess been recognized by
old friends. .The following day The Call
exclusively told of her arrival and gave
the first indication that her visit was due
to matters pertaining to the distribution
of the vast estate of the late railroad
magnate.
The following day the Princess was be
sieged by newspaper men, who -were de
sirous of learning whether she intended
contesting the will of her foster parent.
She denied the news gatherers an audi
ence and departed for Sacramento on' the
morning train to visit her mother, Mrs.
Clara Prentice, who resides at Four
teenth and L streets In the capital city.
The Princess gave out .the Impression
that she was not visiting the State for the
purpose of collecting evidence that would
substantiate her claim to a bigger por
tion of the estate. Her presence In the
State capital, however, revived interest
in the fact that shortly after the death
of Collis P. Huntington a search was
made through the musty archives of Sac
ramento County by some one represent
ing the Huntir.gton interests for a record
of the formal adoption of the Princess
by Huntington. but though the search
was vigorously carried on the document
could not be found. This search was
made, it is alleged, in the interests of the
Huntingtons and as a preliminary step
toward â¢ resisting a possible attack to
break the wilL
Recent Visit of the Princess.
The exclusive announcement in The
Call that Princess vc-n Hatzfeldt Is to re
ceive 56,000,000 for relinquishing all claim
to a daughter's full share of the late
Ccllis P. Huntington's estate was the
principal topic of conversation in society,
club and railroad- circles yesterday. The
positive announcement that a settlement
had been agreed upon and the story 'of
the manner in which It had been effected
was -a. Â¦ morsel of gossip -which society
greatly enjoyed. ' .
Friends of the Hatzfeldts. and Hunting
tons were aware that negotiations were
pending, and now that It is known that a
compromise has been reached are inclined
to congratulate both sides.
1% developed yesterday that Attorney
Joseph D. â¢ Redding, who represented the
Princess In theâ settlement of her claim
against the estate of the dead railway
Croesus, Is to receive the munificent sum
of $300,000 for his valuable services. No
one begrudges him his fee, as he has
worked indefatigably to bring negotia
tions to a successful issue. He has cross
ed the continent a number of times, has
had repeated Interviews with all parties
concerned, and it is chiefly due to his di
plomacy and legal acumen that a settle
ment was finally brought about.
Mrs. Noble said that they had been
married about six months, and that. they
had come .to California for a vacation.
The woman showed the effects of her de
bauch and was put to bed in the hospital.
Noble's wound is not serious and though
he claimed, that; he could see perfectly,
Dr. McElroy thinks that he will lose tho
sight of one eye.
Noble is'an engineer, on the Northwest
ern Railroad. His brotherhood card gives
his address as Jamesville, TVis. - .
Policeman Frank Engel was Immediate
ly notified of the shooting, and' had the
wounded man and his wife taken to the
Receiving Hospital, j An examination by
Dr. McElroy showed that the bullet had
passed through. the jaw and had come out
near the corner of the; eye. . /
"While on the operating table Noble com
plained of his poor marksmanship, and
said that he was sorry that he had not
killed himself.
-Noble and his^wife registered at the
hotel on Thursday afternoon, since which
time '.both have been â¢ considerably under
the influence of liquor.' Yesterday: after
noon the -Couple, according to .the story
told by: Mrs. Noble, quarreled, each ac
cusing the other of being unfaithful. The
woman says .Noble forced her to drink
several glasses ol liquor, and then secur
ing a revolver from his valise, placed it
close to his head and fired. I In pulling the
trigger the would-be suicide lowered the
revolver, and as a result the shot struck
him In the : face, v
. "Walter B. / Noble, a locomotive engin
eer, and a recent arrival from Chicago,

dal; intent shortly after 6 o'clock last
evening in his 'room in â¢ the Brooklyn Ho

cusedby Treasury Department Officers of the $30,ooO;Robbery
THE preliminary examination of
Walter N. Dimmick, the" former
chief clerk of the branch Mint <n
this city, on the charge of em
bezzling $498 37 on April 7, 1900.
was begun before United States Commis
sioner Haacock yesterday. This is but
one ct e. /series of similar charges pre
ferred against Dimmick by the Federal
authorities, all of which have a tendency
to'connect him with the robbery of $30,000
frpm the Mint vaults several months ago.
Dimmick. pale from -his short confine
ment -' and nervous from the strain to
which he has lately been subjected, came
into the stuffy little courtroom. In charge
of United States Marshal Shine and Depu
ty United States Marshal ; Gamble. ' He
sat near his counsel, George D. Collins,
and frequently conferred with him. United
It.'. Then my bookkeeper ' entered up the ,
amount of, the other bills." - . ,|
Cole's examination at the morning ses- > t
sion was very slow, as he had not- pro- ;
vided himself withthe books of the Mint, :
but ' this was ' remedied at the â¢ afternoon :
setiion, the most important point brought
out for the Government being that at no ,
time during the month of April, 1900, .was:
there any shortage in the funds ; against Â¦
Â¦which these amounts should - have been .
charged "to have necessitated their being )
carried from day to day as "cash." Cole'
read off. the daily balances in each fund;
and the.se were entered in. the record. -..Â¦
On cross-examination. Attorney Collins I
directed his efforts to â¢ ascertaining . the
substance of the conversation between
Cole and Dimmick at ; the time of the
monetary transactions. Cole testified that -
Ij'mmick was nervous, and that his hand"
shook. About half an hour after he left, .
