AT midnight Secretary, Cor telyou made the following statement: "Mrs. McKinley is resting comfortably and reports as to her condition being serious are exaggerated. ?- Her- health has always been delicate and the long
journey and excitement have told on her. Her health is no worse now than it was when President McKinley: was first inaugurated.. The -President considers San point in the - State and it was
deemed advisable to bring Mrs. McKinley hereto rest and avoid the excitement of receptions in interior :' towns:"; From San-Francisco'the'Pre^ident can make side trips^and be near his wife." â¢
The Call's representative asked Mr. Cortelyou if he apprehended that Mrs. McKinley's illness might by ; any possibility interfere with the ''programme.' of, entertainment.^
"We have no reason for any such apprehension," said he, "nor do we expect that any part of the trip will be abandoned. If Mrs." McKinley^s resting as comfortable v to-morr6.w' morning as at present the President will be

SUNDAY OUTING
OF GERMANS
NEW YORK, May 12,-When properly
considered, the story of the Northern Pa
cific corner that precipitated the panic in
Wall street on Thursday last is simply an
illustration of an old saying that there
can be "too. much of a good thing."
Harmony of interest and community of
ownership are not' bad ideas, but when
harmony of Interest Is carried to the ex
tent that it conflicts with or seems to en
danger Individual Interests It may become
tha very worst disturber possible.
From the developments of tha last few
days It 1h mada very apparent that the of
forte of ono not of men\to acquire lntorost
In other*' properties flngemlerud hlttor
feeling. That thin should Imvo broken out
in a stock marknt duel Is not surprising.
It in now iniulx clear that tho attempt on
tho part of Mr. Morgan and Mr. lilll to
ncqulru tho Ht. Paul rorul not only vvhh
not favored by the Standard OH ami Van
dorbilt IntcrostH, but wan stronuouiily op
posed by them, and that tho subxequont
successful attempt to obtain tho liurling
torl property has resulted In an.opon
breach of peace between tho Interests rep
resented by tho banking firm of J. 1'Iur
pont Morgan & Co. on ono hand and
Kuhn, Loeb & Co. on the other. This is
not a fight, as some would have It, be
tween banking houses, but between capi
talists identified with great railroad prop
erties;
Tho true story of tho long contest Is
hero told for the first time. The struggle
has extended over months and originated
in London at a meeting in which three
men seated at a table 1 with a railroad
map of the United States spread before
them calmly considered whose properties
they would acquire. That some persons
should have resented ; the . attempts to
carry out tho plans made there is not
strange, nor Is it peculiar that their pro
tection of their own properties has caused
a bitter fight. The capitalistic interests
that are clashing are the greatest in the
country. How the struggle will end no
one can tell.
It was not Union Pacific Interests alone
which objected to the Burlington-Great
Northern-Northern Pacific deal. The own
ers of the St. Paul road : are surveying a
line to the Pacific Coast, and Chicago and
Northwestern. interests are, by no means
idle. Men who were once loud in praise of
"harmony of interest" now maintain. that
the Burlington deal is the most ill advised
railroad undertaking since the West Shore
and Nickel Plate affairs. Â¦ y~\

be discussed at to-day's meeting. : Â¦
â¢The Standard's . financial article says
that any extreme measure. to force deliv
eries of the stock' probably * would be
warmly resented by the Stock Exchangje.
The Daily Mail considers that any sucht
arbitrary Interference with customs would
have more ill effect than good. The Dally
News in its financial articles observes:
"The penalty of unpopularity and dis
credit arising from the enforcement of ex
treme measures, such as are expressly
discountenanced in this market, will not
be readily, incurred by the powerful firms
concerned, even should the railway 'deal'
be thereby imperiled." I

Secretary Explains Illness.
"There is no secret about the illness of
Mrs. McKlnley," he said, "and the Presi
dent desires that nothing should be held
back as to her condition. She is ill, but
is not as 111 as has been reported. She
has been suffering from a" felon on the
first finger- of her- right hand. 'It is
thought- that "she either injured her hand
inthe cars or. that herrings bruteed the
flesh owing to the constant shaking of
hands. The felon was extremely painful,
and -Dr. Rixey was compelled to lance it
twice. That afforded Mrs. McKinley con
siderable relief,- but the" suffering," to
gether .with the excitement resulting from
the long Journey and the receptions, re
quires that she have complete rest.
"It is not true that there was any dan
ger of blood-poisoning, nor' that Mrs. Mc-
Kinley was placed under-the influenceof
opiates Â¦ to â¢ allay Â¦ the pain. * Some- opiates
were possibly used when the hand was
lanced. The > President desires that, all
publicity be given as to the exact.condi
tion of Mrs. McKinley, and that these
alarming rumors be denied. : , . Â¦ â¢ .
"Mrs.-. McKinley has stood the trip from.
Monterey better than was expected, and
she is now resting eapler. Local applica
tions-to her hand are now being made,
and Dr. Rixey -has not lanced it again.
, "The i President hopes to : be able to
carry out all-* his engagements in this
city and to go to San Jose in the morn
ing. Unless there Is sL sudden change In
the condition of Mrs. McKinley, the
President will be in San Jose to-morrow."
Dr. Hirschfelder and Dr. Rixev were in
consultation until 9 o'clock last evening
and no change was decided upon as to
the treatment of Mrs, McKlnley. It was
reported that she was restine comfort
ably, and with rest would soon regain her
health. The doctors also reported that
the bone felon on ,Mrs.. McKinley's hand
was healing nicely.
During the evening General Shatter, ac
companied by Captain Eugene T. Wilson,
hi* nid, called at the Scott residence and
were received by thÂ« President. Irving

ceived by the President.

CHATTFFETJBS TO TAKE PART.
Members of the Automobile Club
Fortunately the news was exaggerated.
Mrs. McKlnley for the past three days
has suffered from a felon on the flrft fin
ger of her right hand and the severe pain,
added to her delicate state of health, re
sulted in a nervous collapse.
Felon Causes Excessive Pain.
Tbe exact cause cf the felon on the
hand of Mrs. McKinley is not known. It
Is thought that she either injured- her
hand while on the train or that owing to
the bankshaking she did in Los Angeles
the rings she wore were pressed into her
fingers. On Saturday Dr. Rixey was com
relled to lance the hand twice. This af
forded relief, but the Intense pain toid
sadly on Mrs. McKlnley's nervous system
and at midnight she was reported to be
in a serious condition.
President McKinley decided yesterday
morning that he would bring his wife to
San Francisco, where she could secure
rest and be free from the excitement at
tending the progress of the Presidential
party. Tho week's visit scheduled for this
city would enable the President to be near
to ilrs. McKinley and at the same time
take part in the various functions on the
programme for this week.
A special train was accordingly ordered
by Private Secretary Cortelyou, and at 12:43
p. m. the start waa made for Monterey.
The train consisted ct the President's car.
"Olympia," a Pullman coach and a bag
gape car. Accompanying the President
and Mrs. McKlnley were Mr. and Mrs.
Cortelyou, Henry T. Scott, Laurence
Been, Miss Barber, Dr. Rixey, Secret Ser
vice Agent G. F. Fester, and the Presi
dent's servants.
Along the line the coming of the Presi
dent and hla wife was kept secret an.I
very few were aware of the identity of
those who occupied the cars until the
train had passed and sped on its way to
San Francisco. . ' â¢
Hurried Trip Kept v Secret-
The railroad company took every pre
caution to prevent the congregation of
crowds of sightseers, and station agents
were warned not to give any information
out to the Tvublie. Â¦ â¢
When the. official news reached San
Francisco that President McKlnley and
his wife were en route to this city, mes
nengcrs and telephone communications
were dispatched in ell directions.
One of the first to be notified was Chief
of Police Sullivan and he at once took
Fteps to guard the safety of the distin
guished party. In a short space of timd
ihe entire Police Department was In
formed of the coming of the Presidential
train and nicked men were hastily rent
to the depot at Twenty-fifth and Valencia
streets, where the travelers were to alight.
The President's train made a reconl run
and et a few minutes before 4 p. m. the
shrill whistle of the locomotive heralded
the oncoming: of the head of the nation.
Irving M. Scott, Mayor Phelan, General
Warfield. Surveyor of the Port J. S. Spear
Jr. and Mrs. Spear and James R. Dunn,
CKief of th* Chinese Bureau, all of whom
are personal friends of the President,
drove up to the depot within the hour i>re-.
ceding the arrival of the special trsiln.
Chief of Police Sullivan himself tcck
charge of the arrangements at the depot
and. aided by Cantain WIttman, Captain
Spillane. Lieutenant Ancerson and Ser
p-eants Shea and Ellis, placed the thirty
police officers so as to prevent intrusion
on the Presidential rarty. About 1500
people had congregated at the depot, hut
the police kept all but a few privileged
persons at a distance from the track.
Only those mentioned above and the press
representatives were allowed on the plat
form.
President Prevents Cheering.
At one minute before 4 p. m. the train
carrying the President and his wife grli\>u
into the station. The carriage of Henty
T. Scott was driven close up to the rear
steps of the car "Olympla" and in a few
minutes President McKinley appeared on
the platform. A cheer rent the air. but
the President quickly raised his hand end
motioned for silence. The desire to ex
tend a welcome to the chief executive was
6ubdued by the knowledge that he was
present not in his official capacity but
simply as a husband solicitous for the
comfort of a stricken wife.
There was no official greeting to Presi
dent McKinley. He did not even shake
the hand of a single person, distinguished
or otherwise, who stood near the steps
of his private car.
The President looked pale and haggard
and his features betrayed the solicitude
which he felt. Those, who had looked for
ward to welcoming President and Mrs.
McKinley with lusty Bhouts when they
reached San Francisco stood mute and
sorrowful as Mrs. McKinley was "carried
in a chair from the inside of the car to
the platform. The President entered the
carriage as the colored attendants lifted
their orecious burden close to the. steps.
He clapped his arms arour.d the body cf
his wife and. aided by Dr. Rixey, placed
the frail lady In the carriage.
Saw Sweet Pallid Face.
Only a privileged few were close enough
to secure a view of Mrs. McKinley. They
simply saw a stricken woman for a few
seconds, eo quickly was the transfer from
the car to the carriage made. They saw
a face of angeiio sweetness, sorrowful in
its expression and pale as the color of the
lilies. They saw the eyes of Mrs. Mc-
Kinley with the light of love in them. as
they rested on the face of her husband.
As soon as Mrs. McKinley was placed In
the carriage, the President placed his arm
around his wife and drew her head down
upon his shoulder. Dr. Rixey jumped in
and drÂ«w down the blinds, and the word
to start was given. Mounted- police offi
cers J. Kelly, J. N. Berrle, C. Arelanes
and J. de la Guerre wheeled in position,
on each side of the carriage, which' was
driven slowly through the silent crowds.
Hats were respectfully removed, and the
wishes of the President were respected,
in that none forgot himself and cheered.
In order to avoid attracting attention,
the rest of the Presidential party drove by
a' different route from that taken by the
carriage bearing President and Mrs, Mc-
Kinley to the residence of Henry T. Scott
at Laguna and Clay streets. From the
depot the President's carriage proceeded
to Twelfth street, to Market street, across
Market Â«trtet to Van Ness avenue, to
Hut-li, to Gough, to Washington, to La
guna and to Clay street, to tho Scott resi
dence.
Thousands of persons saw the carriage
with its police escort pass along and like
wild-fire tha news of the arrival of the
President and his wife spread all over the
city.
Ahead of the President'* carriage drove

The President on alighting from his car

of the cheers that reached his ears, but
instantly turned to tuiperlntoftd the re
moval of Mm. McKlnley from the vehicle.
The colored attendants of the President,
who had driven ahead to the Scott resi
dence, had prepared a bamboo chair with
cushions, and it was placed close to the
carriage. The President and Dr. Rixey.
with the aid of the attendants, removed
Mrs. McKlnley from the carriage to the
chair, and the attendants then carried her
Into the house. President McKinley walk
ed by the side of the chair and his face
was extremely sad and wan. Not a word
was uttered as Mrs. McKinley was con
veyed Into the house. ...!â¢Â¦
Police Guard Chief Executive.
A detail of police officers and detectives
were on duty around the Scott residence.
No one will be allowed to disturb the
quietude so necessary for Mrs. McKinley.
Secret Service Agent Foster, who is re
sponsible for the President's safety, will
be constantly, on duty, and the police,
guard will be maintained day and night.
When Mrs. McKinley was taken into
the Scott residence she was at -once con
veyed to the room upstairs reserved for
her. *
Dr. Joseph O. Hirschfelder, the family
physician of Henry. T. Scott, wag request
ed to be at the house previous to the ar
rival of the President, and, the services
of two trained nurses were also secured.
'Secretary Cortelyou received a repre-
j arrangements of the day were overturned
because of It. Yesterday afternoon she
was still weak, and last evening she
fainted in her room, and for several hour3
serious alarm was felt for her safety. So
when a hasty wire was sent to Pacific
Grove this morning ordering the Presi
dent s engine to make steam and come to
i Del MtrHte at once, and it became known
. that the President and his wife were go
; ing to San Francisco, it caused no aston
1 ishment, although it was altogether unex
' pected.
It was the advice of Dr. Rixey that Mrs.
McKinley be sent where she could enjoy
8. long and uninterrupted rest with her
Â¦husband near her, and so it was decided
to send her to the Scott house, where for
a J week the President will reside, and
there let her gather health and strength
for the home journey. There is quietude
enough and room to spare at Del Monte,
but the President would upset all ar
rangements did he remain here as long:
as would be necessary for Mrs. McKinley
to recuperate, and so, as she could stand
the trip, it was thought best to send her
on to the city. Besides, it was believed
that by* special trips from San Francisco
to localities. scheduled for a visit on the
itinerary the President could be present
and still return frequently to his wife's
bedside.
No Visit to Santa Cruz.
At first it was announced that the Pres
ident would return to Del Monte this
evening, but this was later corrected.
Then it was announced that he would not
leave the city at all, but this, too, was
corrected, and to-night it Is announced
here that the President would be at tha
Burlingame luncheon, and If Mrs. McKln
ley had Improved sufficiently to make tho
President content to leave her he would
be ct San Jose. This leaves the visit to
Santa Cruz out. It may be that Mrs. Mc-
Klnley will be bo Improved that the
President will reach there, but the prob
ability is that he will not make the trip.
Telegrams received this evening by varl
lous members of the party announce that
Mrs. McKlnley stood the trip well, and
that she la much better.
The President Intended to attend church
in Pacific Grove this morning, but when
tho hour for the service arrived the pas
tor, Rev. Dr. Klrby. was informed that
the President could not make the trip to
Pacific Grove, as he would not leave Mrs.
McKlnley, and so the services proceeded
without him. At the same time.- however,
the report got around that the President 3
engine had been ordered to Del Monto
from where It was sidetracked at Pacific
Grove, and every one guessed the reason.
The President's car and the combination
car were detached from the train find
were made ready for the flying trip north
ward. It was decided that the party
should be made up of President and Mrs.
McKinley. Secretary Cortelyou. Dr..Rtx
ey, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Scott, Mls3
Barber and Laurence Scott.
Departure From Del Monte.
There was much hurrying and running
about, and the hotel was In confusion for
some time after the departure had been
announced. Mrs. McKlnley was made
ready for the Journey with as much dls
patctv as possible, and was carried down
to the entrance reserved for the President,
Â¦where the carriage was waiting. She was
very weak, but fully sensible /of her sur
roundings and able to appreciate what
was being done for her.
The horses had been taken from the
carriage s6 that no sudden start should
occur while she was being made comfort
able. Then the carriage was driven to the
station, the horses were unhitched again
and the sick woman was carried to her
room in the President's car.
The President stood by her while she
was â¢ belns taken from the carriage, and
he walked beside her, holding her hand,
while she was carried to the car. He came
out on the rear platform and raised his
hat to the few people who had come to
the station, and disappeared, and a min
ute, after ' the rails were slng-lns: under
,'the cars as they sped on to the city.
"The departure' of the tram leaves Sec
retary Hay as the leader of the Presiden
tial party, and the absence of Secretary
Cortelyou leaves his . duties relating to
the party In the hands of Assistant Secre
tary Barnes. The train will follow the
Itinerary originally laid out as far as San
Francisco. If at the end of the week In
San Francisco the President's wife is able
to travel the remainder of the Itinerary
will be carried out. but It may be that the
trip north will -have to;. .be cut out alto
gether, and that the train will run back
to "Washington direct from ' the Golden
Gate. '

DEL MONTE. May 12.-It was
planned that the Sunday at Del

and so far as events of enter

morning was broken by the de

and each sought rest and recreation In his
own way.

find. He returned amazed and bewildered,
for there is not m-^ch in the way of plant
life that cannot be found somewhere in
the Del Monte park.
Secretary Hitchcock also went sight-see

of knowledge by a practical investigation
of the possibilities of western soil. Ad

Friday, and whose condition was such
that her physician, Dr. George S. Field,
refused to pronounce her dead owinff to
uncertain signs of life about the body,
died to-day after being In a cataleptic
state for forty-three hours. From the
time when it is supposed death took pos
session of the body there were signs
which completely mystified the physi
cians and others called in for consulta
tion. Early to-day the watchers were
startled to observe a twitching of the
muscles of the body, beginning- at the neck
and continuing to the lower part of the
abdomen. It was hoped that she would
regain consciousness, but the convulsion
lasted but a short time, the warmth left
the body and unmistakable signs of death
appeared. Several hours later Dr Field
pronounced her dead. He ascribed the im
mediate cause to paralysis of the heart.

WASHINGTON, May 12.â A general
strike, involving directly 150,000 machin
ists and indirectly 500,000 men in the met
al working trades, is expected to take
place on May 20 unless some arrangement
is effected in the meantime. This Is the
statement made to-night by President
James O'Connell of the International As
sociation of Machinists, who has head
quarters in this city. The demands of
the men, the refusal of which threatens
to precipitate the strike, . Mr. O'Connell
said, are a working day of nine hours and
an increase of 12% per cent In wages, or,
in other words, ten hours' pay for nine
hours' work. The matter, he said, has
been under consideration for some time,
and every effort has been made by the
machinists' association to avoid resorting
to a strike, .but such action, he says', is
now necessary if the workingmen' hope
to attain the end they are striving '.. for.
Some time ago, through the efforts of the
International Association and the Na
tional Trades Association, the employers
of about 25 per cent of the men who. will
be affected by the strike made I conces
sions by agreeing to a' general work day
of nine hours, which was to become oper
ative on May 20 of this year. The ques
tion of an increase of wages, however,
or Its equivalent, the granting -of ten
hours' pay for nine hours, remained un
settled. :
Yesterday the representatives of the
Metal Trades Association and the Nation
al Association of Machinists held a con
ference in New York, at which an attempt
was made to reach an agreement on the
wage matter, so that the strike proposed
for May 20 could be avoided. Mr. O'Con
nell, however, says that the employers re
fused to arbitrate the question of wages
nationally, but that they expressed a
willingness that this matter be settled by
employers locally, each individual . case to
be treated as such. This method is un
satisfactory to the -representatives of. the
Machinists' Association, who express the
opinion that this would prolong indefinite
ly the, settlement of the question. Upon
his return* to the city Mr. O'Connell
promptly prepared the order . for the
strike, and it was sent out by mail . to
day. 1 ,Â¦Â¦â'Â¦, . -Â¦-â¢.'
Mr. . O'Connell says that about 200 firms,
whose employes represent probably 20 per
cent of the 600,000. men who will be affected
by the proposed strike, have signed agree
ments, for the reduction in the. hours of
labor and the Increase of pay, so that the

that he will attend the banquet to be
given by the Ohio Society Thursday
night, at which Governor Nash will be
one of the guests of honor.
The departure for San Jose by special
train was without fuss and feathers or
any excitement greater than that caused
by several members of the party missing
the train. The unfortunate ones will go
down to San Jose this morning in time to
catch up with the party and accompany
it on the trip to the big trees. .

closely upon the heels of the reception
as a representative of the Ohio Society,

Larkln and McAllister Streets to Sierra
Point.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 11, 1901.
Hon. J. G. Brick. President Board of Trus
tees, City of Alamedaâ Dear Sir: On May 12,
1901, five contestants will start from this city
on a bicycle relay race around tho bay of
San Fruncisco with a letter similar to this,
which will be in the possession of each I rider.
The one arriving first will deliver tho letter
to you. I trust you will seti fit to crown the
successful contestant and proclaim him victor.
Respectfully, JAMES D. PHELAN,
Â¦ . Mayor.!
The start was made at 9:06 from the cor
ner of Larkln and McAllister streets. The
accident to McDonald and Braun lost
them two minutes, though McDonald
made up a minute of this time before the
end of his relay. . - Â¦
In relay races each club furnishes the
rider of the first relay with a leather
packet containing a letter from the Mayor
of this city to the President* 1 of the Board
of Trustees â¢ of the city of Alameda, the
race being between San Francisco and
Alameda by way of San JosÂ». The letter
contained in these - packets yesterday
reads as follows: ,.
This was, fortunately, the only bad ac
cident of the race save on the first relay,
when C. L. Braun, California Club, col
lided with Arthur McDonald, Garden
City. Both fell and Braun suffered a
broken finger. . - ' ' Â¦ ' - Â¦.
An unfortunate spill at the tape nearly
resulted disastrously to the Olympic cour
ier's chances. K. F. Russ was riding the
tenth relay for this club, against Walter
J. Davidson of the Bay Citys. The Gar
den City rider had finished' over five min
utes ahead of them, and owing to the
friendly rivalry between the Bay Citys
and Olympics much interest was mani
fested as to which would finish second.
They came up the street neck and neck
for several blocks, and the crowd about
the finish rushed into the street until there
was only a narrow lane for the cyclists to
pass through. Russ hit some one with his
shoulder just at the tape, wobbled and
fell in a heap, Davidson getting by un
scathed. J. R. Kenna, Davidson's trailer,
was close behind and dashed Into the me
lee caused by Russ' accident. . Both Russ
and Kenna were considerably bruised and
their wheels were badly smashed.
San Francisco, Lace Downing
crossing the tape in Alameda five and a
half minutes ahead of his nearest com
petitor and breaking the coast record for

Wheelmen were second and the Olympic
Wheelmen- third by a fifth of a second.

This provoked so much excitement
among the native populace that a real,
rabid fanatic in the stand fell unconscious,
and as Dr. Moskiman was the sole medico
in the grounds the game was stopped un
til the sadder but wiser man revived un
der the doctor's attention. The score:
Â¦with the bags crowded Nordyke rolled
out a two-bagger, three runs resulting.
This tied the r-core. but only for a brief
period. In the seventh inning "Whalen
went to pieces. By local errors and a
Dude bombardment Held, Drennan, Mos
kiman, Babbitt and Arrellanes scored.
Moskiman and Arrellanes worked off
three-bag stunts in this inning.

SAX FRANCISCO.
Francks' home run was the only heavy
fire against Evsns' delivery. Some sensa
tional stick work was done by Croll, who
ihree times up made as many hits. The
score : *
The game began "with a run for the lo
cal team on a couple of hits. In the second
inning Dunlcavy reached the initial bag
<~<n a safe hit. and then Francks found one
to his liki::}r. putting it over the center
f.old fence. Oakland was happy then, but
not for long, for in the very next inning,
while Schwartz and Krug were on the
l>ags. Pab?t with his old-time stick abil
ity rolled out a three-bagger and two runs
were scored.
The game yesterday was full of snap
and Interest, and particularly so in the
ninth when Oakland was at the bat, the
score reading 3-2 against the Dudes. After
one man had perished Francks came to
the stick for a hit and went to second on
Moore's out. Then, following the advice
of Pabst, Evans gave free transportation
to Held, to take his chances with Russell,
who could do nothing with his curves. The
move was a wise one. Two outs, two men
on bases. Evans steadied and Russell
s-truck out.
Roy Evans, the new slab performer for
the "Wasps, bowed to the local fanatics
yesterday afternoon as he stepped into the
box for his first, game on local sod. His
work was of that quality which insures
success if It is sustained. At critical mo
ments he showed that he is made of
proper pitching stuff and that he is likely
to prove a stumbling block to opposing
batsmen.

EVANS' ARM IS
A GAME WINNER
Though the breeze was steady and mod
erately strong over nearly the whole dis
tance, the yachts that kept over to the
Marin shore after leaving Carquinez
Straits made the best of it, getting better
wind than those on the Contra Costa
shore. Off Hurricane Gulch at Old Sausa
lito some hard puffs came down, and one
of these capsized a sailing gig carrying
men from the United States steamer
Manning. The men, however, were quick
ly rescued by a boat from the steamer
McCulloch. The details of the race are
given in the table:
At 9 o'clock on Sundav, morning a blast
from Port Captain James Kitterman's
launch America was the signal for the
boats in class one of the San Francisco
Yacht Club to get ready. .This clasps In
cludes all beats having a racing length
not exceeding i.hirty-flve feet. The yachts
had ten minutes within which to cross the
starting line orawn across the straits
from the launch America to the receiving
ship Independence. Thetis was the first
to cross, and was followed by Siren,
Juanita, Cygnus and Catherine in the or
der named. The breeze was light at first
but freshened considerably, and as there
was no sea in San Pablo Bay and the
race was on an ebb tide the conditions
were unusually favorable to a fast race.
The sloop Thetis made the fastest time
in class one, but was beaten by Siren on
time allowance. The sloop Juanita made
good time, but not having been measured
her corrected time could not be calcu
lated. The prize flag accordingly went to
the sloop Siren, the corrected time of
which was 4 hours 1 minutes 11 seconds.
Thetis was second, Catherine third and
Cygnus fourth. The yawls Phyllis, Naiad
and Spray and the sloops Folly, Aeolus
and Surprise. did not start.
In class two, for yachts exceeding thir
ty-five feet in racing length, the schooner
Ramona and the sloops Nixie and Mischief
were the only s-tarters. The starting sig
nal for these was given at 9:50 a. m., the
boats having until 10 o'clock to cross the
line. Ramona crossed first, followed by
Mischief and Nixie. The sloop Nixie again
displayed her :;need, covering the twenty
six nautical miles in 3 hours 11 minutes 15
seconds actual time, or 2 hours 41 minutes
17 seconds corrected time. Nixie took the
prize flag in class two.
The race was under the management of
the regatta corr.mittee, consisting of Dr.
T. L. Hill, J. R. Savory and W. G. Mor
row, the first two going up to Valiejo
and the last remaining at Sausalito to
time the yachts as they finished across an
imaginary line drawn from the clubhouse
to a stakeboat anchored 400 yards off
shore, the stakeboat being left on the
starboard hand. Quite a little crowd of
spectators watched the finish from the
wharf and veranda of the clubhouse.
Nine boats of the San Francisco Yacht
Club cruised up from Sausalito to Valiejo
on Saturdayafternoon and evening and
raced down yesterday. The first, boat to
leave her Sausalito moorings on Saturday
was J. .R. Savory's sloop Juanlta at 3:05,
followed by T. L. Hill's sloop Cygnus at
3:25, and later by Commodore TV*. N. Mc-
Carthy's flagship Ramona, G. E. Billings'
sloop Nixie, Archie Sutherland's sloop
Catherine. Vice Commodore R. S. Bndg
man's sloop Thetis, G. T. S. White's sloop
Mischief and the sloop Siren. The fleet
had a fair wind to the entrance of Car
quinez Straits and a head wind up the
straits. A large number of Corinthian
yachts also lay at anchor off Valiejo,
among them being the flagship May, the
yawls Seven Bells and Kittiwake and the
sloops Harpoon, Emma, Edna, Amigo,
Nellie, Genesta, Iris, Speedwell, Aeolus,
Queen, Halcyon, Clara, Freda, Mist and
Ariel.

Averill 3 6 6ONE of the significant signs of the times is the
protest from the South against a good deal of
florid writing done by certain Northern corre
spondents'concerning the so-called decline of s'ection
alism among the Southern people since the war with
Spain. The Southerners declare there has been, no
bitterness among them against the Union 'or 1 the
Northern people for many a year. The civil war ended
in the spring of 1865, thirty-six years ago, and since
that time a new generation of Southerners has arisen;
a generation that has been too busily engaged: in
building up industries to have had anytime for; the
nourishing of old hatreds or old prejudices. This

Here in California similar conditions prevail. Pros
perity abounds on every side. Markets heretofore ac
tive continue so, and some which have been dull
showing more life. Many lines of trade report busi
ness better than at this time last year, and some say
that it is better than ever before. Ocean tonnage
may not be quite as active, but there is no surplus in
ships and wheat freights have recently advanced,
showing a strong carrying market. Wholesale mer
chants engaged in the export trade report liberal or
ders for shipment to the usual points. ' Crop pros
pects are brilliant,' and new produce thus far received
has been bringing: higher prices than usual at this
time of the year. All indications continue to point
to a very successful year in trade.
A third peculiar feature was the utter absence of any
influence of the stock panic upon general business.
Merchandise did not even quiver. The foreign and
domestic business of the country, wholesale and retail,
merchandise and produce, went on its way unaffected
Reports from all parts of the country indicated uni
form serenity. The only effect which could be de
scribed by the most observant eye was the checking
of some speculation in grain and provisions, owing to
the diversion of attention to Wall street. The leading
cities all showed a pronounced gain in bank clearings
over the tame week last year, and the failures were
only 193, against 192 last year. The grain markets
were dull and weak, and the prospects for large crops
everywhere acted as a damper on speculation. Pro
vision^' were unsettled, but did not fluctuate much.
Wool continued slow, though there was more doing
in new goods. Boots and sjioes are again increasing
in activity, and the trade is in better condition than
for several weeks. The iron and steel trade is appar
ently as' active as at any time lately, the mills being
crowded with orders, and running to their fully:apa
c-rty. Textiles, as a rule, are the dullest things visible.
The railway earnings continue to show a marked in
crease over corresponding periods last year. Other
wise there is nothing in general trade worthy of com
ment. 0
Another peculiar feature is the remarkable kind
heartedness, benevolence, compassion, or whatever
one chooses to call it, of the victors in this gigantic
combat up among the financial stars. Delivery of
stock Jias been waived by the winners, at least for the
moment, and all the losers have to do is to settle.
And the settling price has been made comparatively
low. Such magnanimity is seldom seen in stock mar
kets. But, perhaps, the enormous money interests
saw that to enforce delivery of stock would cause ugly
failures, which would be a bad thing just now. "So
they let it pass.
In the first place there was no crash. Quotations
dropped sharply, only to recover more or less again,
like the schoolboy's kite that suddenly "dives" high
up in air and immediately rights itself. On previous
similar occasions values have descended to bedrock
before regaining their balance, leaving the downward
path strewn with financial wrecks. Nothing of the
sort took place during the panic last week. It was a
derangement, not a collapse. The stock market of
Wall street is still up in the air like a balloon. It has
careened in a gust of wind, but is still up in the blue.
The collapsing cord has not yet been pulled.
THE public is familiar with the leading feature
in finance last week. It was the cyclone in Wall
street, and was one of the severest ever known.
It had several features, however," sufficiently peculiar
to warrant a passing observation.
WALL, STREET AND TRADE.
â¢ The managers of our great business houses and
employers of every degree should respect this feeling
of the people; for it is one in which they, themselves
undoubtedly share. Then let the recommendation of
the committee be followed. Let every man' and
woman have a chance to join in the welcome to the
President as he moves through the streets on his arri
val. Let us make the afternoon a holiday for alL
. The people wish to see McKinley, and the wish
is a laudable one. The statesman whose name is more
closely associated with work and wages and prosperity
than that of any other President in our history and
who has conducted the affairs of the nation with such
conspicuous skill and sagacity is rightly dearj to th'e
popular It is not a passing enthusiasm due, to
his presence in the city, but a deep and abiding confi
dence in' the patriotism of his statesmanship and per
sonal sympathy with his genuine "Americanism that
prompt the great masses of the people to unite with
one another in making his welcome one that will be
memorable for all time to come.
The parade through so many streets will occupy
virtually the whole of the afternoon. During that
time the thoughts of the people will be given wholly
to the President. Even should the business houses
keep open, very little . business will be done. The
crowds that throng the streets will be there not for the
purpose of shopping but for the purpose of greeting
the President, consequently the merchants and others
will lose 1 nothing by closing their stores and offices
and getting out among their fellow citizens and help
ing to swell the acclamations that welcome to San
Francisco the man who is not only President, but
the best loved statesman of this generation.
The arrangements for the reception on that-day are
fitted for a popular holiday. The President's train
is due to arrive at 3:40 p. m. The grand marshal of
the day with the reception committee, civic, military
and naval officials, accompanied by an escort of honor
composed of bluejackets and. marines from the navy
and troops of the United I States army and' of the
National Guard, will await him at the depot, and from
there the column wiH march down Third street to
Market, to Montgomery, to Bush, to Kearny, to Mar
ket, to Van Ness avenue, and along the avenue 'to
between Bush. and Pine, where it will countermarch
and pass the reviewing stand on the west side of Van
Ness avenue, between Sutter and Post streets, where
the President will review the column. In the evening
the citizens' committee will go in carriages to the
corner of Clay and Laguna streets, where it will meet
the Signal Corps/ of the Second Brigade, National
Guard, and escort the President, via Van Ness avenue,
to Golden Gate avenue, to Market street, and thence
to the ferry depot, where the formal welcome to the
city will be extended by Mayor Phelan and a public
reception held.
What more can be needed for a jubilant half-holi
day? "
FROM the committee having in charge the ar
rangements for the reception of the President
in this city there has come a recommendation
that the afternoon of Tuesday be declared a holiday
by all business houses so that the employes may have
a chance to join in the welcome to the chief magis
trate. The recommendation is a good one. It should
be universally adopted.
MAKE IT A HOLIDAY.
The crusade in New York against the gambling of
fashionable women has reached the flashlight point,
and we are now getting strange stories. According
to one of these a society woman played cards with a
schoolboy visiting her son and won all his pocket
money. If that story be true it is time for the police
as well as the clergy to interfere.
There has never been a scandal affecting the ad
ministration of law by United States courts more seri
ous than that which has developed out of the pro
ceedings of Judge Noyes and McKenzie at Nome.
The action of the Circuit Court was no more than
a vindication of. justice. The imprisonment of Mc-
Kenzie makes him a wholesome example to ' others
who may be tempted by reason of their powerful
friends to disobey orders of the court and violate its
decrees; but if the sentence be commuted and the
offender go free, the moral of the stdry will be any
thing rather than wholesome. To pardon him indeed
would be to vindicate the offender and to reflect dis
credit upon the courts and the Judges who preside in
them/ ' : KÂ£ '
He practiced what he preached. He defied the or
ders of the" Circuit Court of Appeals, and it became
necessary to arrest him and bring him before the court
to answer, for his contempt. Having been convicted
he took an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United
States, but that tribunal upheld the Circuit Court and
he was. sent to jail.
Â¦ Since that time the powerful influences of, which
he boasted have evidently been. at work. An effort
was made to arouse sympathy for him by starting
a report that he is sick and cannot bear confinement.
There has been much talk also about his influential
friends in the Senate* and elsewhere, and suggestions
have been made that the President would pardon
him. Now comes this latest dispatch from Washing
tori "presuming" that the President will exercise the
authority, which the Attorney General says is his, to
commute the sentence of the offender.
The Call has already pointed out in reviewing the
case that as a part of the history of McKenzie's career
at -Nome, it. is related that after he had been made
receiver of nearly all the valuable mines in that local
ity, and was confronted by orders of the^ United States
Circuit Court granting appeals from the decisions of
Judge Noyes, he exHorted the members , of his gang
tostand firm in defiance .of the court and fold them
of his past experience with courts, conventions, legis
latures and the like, in which he had never met defeat,
boasting of the political power that- was behind him,
and assuring them that he had backers who would
carry his schemes to success despite the' Circuit Court.
â¢ The. story of McKerizie's contempt of court is one
of the most extraordinary in our annals. It was an
act of such flagrant violation of law, was committed
in such open defiance of the decrees of the court and
was attended by circumstances of such an aggravating
nature, tjiat to pardon the offense or to commute the
sentence imposed would be to belittle the dignity of
the law and to encourage similar offenses hereafter.
While there may nof be any dispute as to the sound
ness of the Attorney General's opinion, there will
certainly be a protest against the assumption of the
dispatch that the President is to exercise the power
to commute the sentence of.McKenzie.. Nothing has
appeared to justify and such presumption, nor is there
anything of a palliating nature in the offense of Mc-
Kenzie to make him a worthy object of executive
clemency.
DISPATCHES from Washington announce that
Attorney General Knox has forwarded to the
President an opinion that the executive has
power to commute the sentence of a prisoner serving
time for contempt of court. The dispatch adds: "As
this applies particularly at this â¢ time to the case of
Alexander v McKenzie, the Alaska mine receiver, now
in Alameda jail serving a sentence of one year, it is
presumed the President will commute his sentence."

der is not that shÂ« needs rest at this point, but that

Unless the unexpected happens, the arrangements
made for the President will not be changed. From
San Francisco as a center be can visit the surrounding
cities such as San Jose and keep his engagements
there. Mrs. McKinley, however, will remain here
and rest. Some of the functions provided for her will
doubtless have to be omitted from the programme.
That will cause disappointment, but no ill-feeling.
Indeed the one wish of all citizens is now that the
days of rest which she will enjoy in our bracing and
invigorating climate will so completely restore her
strength that she will return to Washington. stronger
than when she left it.
WITH no little satisfaction The Call is able
-to announce this morning that the arrival
of the President and Mrs. McKinley in the
city yesterday ahead of time does not imply any
serious illness on the part of Mrs. McKinley or entail
any considerable change in the programme arranged
for receptions between Del Monte and this city. The
explanation of the movement is that Mrs. McKinley
has been overtaxed by the continuous strain and ex- .
citement of the receptions and fetes along the route
since leaving Washington, and it has been thought
best to relieve her as much as possible of further
strain. She has therefore been brought here to rest
until the time comes for" the Presidential party' to
start on the return to the East.
At midnight The Call had the assurance of the
President's secretary that there is no occasion for
alarm. Mrs. McKinley's illness is not serious. A
few days of rest with relief from the trying ordeals
of incessant receptions will restore her strength and
enable her to make the return journey without dan
ger.
That rest is needed by Mrs. McKinley is not sur
prising. The continuous ovations and receptions
given to the President all along the route and the
numerous calls- upon. Mrs. McKinley have been suffi
cient to tax the strength of the strongest The won-

i This protest coming from? so many sources in the
South shows a sensitiveness on the score of loyalty
that is an excellent evidence of genuine patriotism.
Hereafter the North should remember that while the

itself has been in existence ever since Southern men

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
COPYRIGHT. 1901
XIII.â TIMOTHY KINNEY;
Timothy 'Kinney, the "sheep king," one
of the remarkable men of the West, has'
compelled success by adding. to opportu
nity a" quick Intelligence, great persever
ance and much hard work. On the bar
ren and uninviting deserts of Southwest
Wyoming he has found wealth, and under
his careful management that . wealth
grows at a rate which seems almost in
credible to those, who are not familiar
with the sheep industry as there conduct
ed. "Personal attention to business" is
the motto which he has followed, and to
this rule Mr. Kinney points when asked
to name the winning quality necessarily
found in men of large affairs. Even now,
when; his business has reached enormous
proportions and is on an excellent footing,
he pays careful heed to the smallest de
tails in his bank, in his mercantile house
and on the range.
Career of a Friendless Young Idan.
Born in Ireland in.1846, young Timothy
Kinney began at an early age to struggle
against the poverty that surrounded him.
When he was IB years old he had feecured
enough money, to pay his passage on an
emigrant ship, so he sailed for the United
States, landing in New York. As soon as
he was able to do so he made his way to
Madison, Wis., where he arrived without
money or friends. He became a^day la
borer at such work as his ybu^n would
permit him to perform. After several
years he went to Rawlins, Wyo., where
he secured work as a car repairer in the
Union Pacific Railway shops. At the end
of a year he was transferred to the rail
way office as a clerk, and after another
year he was made station agent at Rock
Springs. Some months after that he be
came ticket agent at Omaha for the Union
Pacific. He resigned ' from the service
soon, however, and visited his relatives in
Ireland, returning in 1S74 to become once
more- the -Union Pacific agent at Rock
Springs. He remained in that position
until 1881. By that, time he had saved
enough money to begin the business of
cattle raising in a small way on Bitter
Creek, west of Rock Springs.
Disaster in Cattle Raising.
For eight years Mr. Kinney made
money rapidly in cattle, - but the severe
storms of ithe winters of 1889 and 1S90 near
ly brought his affairs to ruin, as he lost
more than 75 per cent of his stock. Dur
ing, the* following two years he recovered
in part from his losses, but fearing a
return of his former disastrous experience
he disposed of his cattle interests in the
fall of 1891 and turned his attention to
sheep raising. He purchased 16,000 sheep,
the total cost of which was about $35,000.'
As he had had no experience in hand
ling sheep his new venture was supposed
to be in danger of proving unfortunate
for him but, on the contrary, his flocks
increased steadily in value and' the num
bers of the animals multiplied at a won
derful rate. By the spring of 1893, when
sheep men all over the country were sell
ing out their holdings on account of the
threatened panic/he could have realized
70 ner cent, on his investment. He. would
not sell, however^ and through .the suc
ceeding years of panic his sheep contin
ued to double in numbers every twelve
months. Had he been compelled to sell
them then at the prevailing prices they
would not have brought, enough to pay
his debts, but- his creditors had faith in
his judgment and left him > free .to wait
for better times before making a settle
ment with them? -_ j '
Finds Huge Profits in Sheep.
From 1S94, when the prices of sheep and
wool were at their lowest, to 1S99, prices
for both wool and mutton advanced
steadily, and as Mr. Kinney during all
those years disposed only of his wool
clip and a few old animals each season,
his flocks grew to enormous proportions
while every pound; of thenv continued to
increase in value. It may be of interest
to mark the steps whereby he turned a
part of his vast holdings into money,
when the price finally reached a point at
which he was willing to sell. ' â¢
In the fall of 1899 Mr. Kinney- made his
first large sales of sheep, disposing oÂ£
10,000 two-year-old wethers, for which he
received a trifle. over $4 apiece. He also
sold 4000 yearling wethers at $3 60 a head
and 3000 lambs at $2 65 a head, the total
being $62,350. In 1S95 an"d 1896 these same
grades*of wethers sold for $2 to $2 50 and
lambs for $1 to $1 50. This gives some
Idea of the profits made by Mr. Kinney
through holding his shSep for three
years. ',.'Â¦Â¦' P -
In 1899 Mr. Kinney' s wool clip amounted
to over 600,000 pounds, which he sold at
11 to 15 cents a pound, it netting him
about $72,000. which, with his sales of
sheep that year, brought . him in $134,350,
all from a $35,000 investment, he still hav
ing thousands of sheep left. .
Taking the Wool Clip to Market.
In that year Mr. Kinney's wool clip
was hauled to the Eastern market in a
special train of sixteen cars. Last year
a special train of twenty-five cars was
required to haul the wool clip. Those two
shipments j were tne largest ever sent to
market by an individual wool grower.
After shipping his wool last fall and re
ceiving $90,000 for it, Mr. Kinney began
to sell off some of his sheep. At that
time his flocks numbered about 135,000
head and he was" the largest individual
owner of sheep' in the United States. He
first sold 47,000 ewes and later disposed of
24,000 wethers, 34,000 lambs and 700 bucks,
a total of 106,700, for- which he received
in round numbers $324,000.
During the two months following these
sales prices jumped upward and it Is esti
mated that had Mr. Kinney sold his sheep
two months later than he did he would
have received 5440.000, or about $116,000
more than he really rcot for them. ;."
Caring for His Great Frocks. >
Some Idea of the magnitude of Mr. Kin
ney's sheep and wool raising business
may be gained from the following fig
ures : " * Â¦ . *
During the year 1900 It required 100 men
to look after his sheep. This force con
sisted of a general foreman' and an as
sistant, these receiving $75 and $t>0 a month
respectively; herders, camp movers, and
teamsters, $40 a month each, and general
hands $35 a month. The men on the
range are supplied with board, which
costs from $15 to $30 a month for each
man, this bringing the total monthly pay
roll up to about $6000.
Mr. Kinney's home ranch is on Smiths
Fork in Uinta County, Wyoming, near
the Idaho -line.- He controls a tract of
State land eighteen miles long bordering
on the stream and a large number of
school sections, which he leases from the
State. Along Smiths Fork and its tribu
tary streams the "sheep king" cuts thou
sands of tons of hay annually, which Is
fed to his sheep during storms on the
plains in winter.
sjj Long Trips From Ranch, to Ranch.
During all seasons of the year Mr. Kin
ney is a very busy man. He travels from
Rock Springs to the main ranch and from
it to the auxiliary ranches in a buck
board drawn by two horses. His bedding
and his cooking utensils he carries in a
box under the wagon seat, for the "sheep
king" frequently spends a night on . the
open prairie many miles from the nearest
house. v He has selected good men to look
after his flocks, but he seldom trusts them
wholly, and he makes frequent trips from
camp to camp to superintend the work
of caring for his large flocks.
Mr. Kinney was recently reappolnted a
member of the Wyoming Board of Sheep
Commissioners, of which he is the presi
dent. The board is doing much In the in
terests of the sheepmen of the State, and
under the watchful care of its members
diseased sheep are not allowed to be
driven or shipped into Wyoming. The
board recently, issued a pamphlet showing
that Wyoming leads all other States in
wool production and value of sheep.
BUs Other Business Interests.
Mr. Kinney owns a controlling interest
in the First National Bank of Rock
Springs, of which he is president. He Is
also the head of a large mercantile house
at Rock Springs. . These Institutions are <n
a flourishing condition. Though a million
aire, he prefers the wild and uninhabited
desert and the companionship of his
thousands of sheep to the refinements of
city life.

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
A transport named the VaucleusÂ© was
launched at Hochefort April IS last. She
was beirun in 1SS5 and has thus been six
teen years on the stocks. The hull, be
ing of wood, has therefore had a thorough
seasoning, conducive to a long . servica
of usefulness. The Vaucleuse beats the
record of the Mohican in our navy, whlchi
was "bulilt at Mare Island. The keel was
laid In November, 1872, launched December
27, 1S83, and sailed on> her first cruise Juns
27, 18S5. As the Vaucleuso has only been
recently launched It will no doubt take a
year to fit her for sea, thus making her
period of construction seventeen years,
against less then thirteen years for tha
Mohican. The French transport Is of only
1615 tons displacement, and has engines of
800 horse-power, intended to give a speed
of 11 knots, and the Mohican is of 1900
tons displacement. 1000 horse-power, and!
10.65 'knots. As to the cost of the two
ships, that of the Mohican has never been
figured out with any degree of accuracy,
and the cost of the Vaucleusa Is probably}
also somewhat uncertain.
Naval schools are to be located at each
of the principal dock-yards of Franca,
for the education in the principal servica
requirements, such as practical and theo
retical marine engineering, torpedo work
and gunnery. The applicants must be be
tween 13 and 15 years old, and are to enlist
at the age of 16 for a five-years' service.
"The school term covers four years, and
the studies embrace mathematics, physics,
chemistry, mechanics, engine design and
practice, drawing, history, geography,
English and French. Besides the practical
application of these studies In use of tor
pedoes and target practice, the pupils will
also have six months' work in the yard or
on board ships at the station. The object
of these schools is to supply the navy with
intelligent young men to fill lower official
positions, especially in the engineer de
partment, in which latter successful grad
uates may reach the higher grades.
The armored cruiser Kent, building at
the Portsmouth dock-yard, has been sub
jected to a severe. test of her water-tight
compartments. The port engine room was
pumped full of water, no air-space being
left, but the weight of 1,000 tons of water
did not cause a single rivet to weep, and
the bulkheads stood theÂ«test without bulg
ing. The trial was made with a view of
ascertaining what the result would be In
the event of the engine-room being flood
ed through collision or other accidents oa
the sea.
A serious mishap occurred at thÂ© ne-v
Dower fortifications while a 9.2 inch gun.
weighing twenty-seven ions, was beinj
hoisted .from ship into position. A link
in the Jib chain suddenly sna-^ed and
the gun went crashing through the
ship's deck and hull, penetrating the bot
tom, and the vessel was sunk. On ths
next day divers patched up the breach,
and the vessel was pumped out. The new
guns forming the battery will carry about
fifteen miles across channel.

When all the powers Interested had decided
to send troops to China for the same purpose,
the Imperial Government proposed, as a rule
of conduct In relation to the affairs of China,
these fundamental principles: Maintenance of
the agreement between the powers, prevention
of the Government of China, existing ab anti
quo elicinatio of everything that might lead
to the partition of the Celestial* empire, and,
finally, re-establishment by joint effort of a
legal central government at Peking, which
of itself could guarantee the peace and order
of the country. Â¦ I .
An agreement was reached upon these points
by most of the powers.
Serious differences of opinion tmong
the Ministers as to the penalties to be in
flicted upon the chief instigators of the
insurrection are referred to as follows:
Having declared Itself at the outset opposed
to the death penalty the Imperial Government
directed Its representative, in view of the na

point, not to enter into a debate relating to
the capital punishment to be inflicted upon.

W.. WASHINGTON. May 12.â Russia's
earnest efforts to facilitate the conclusion
of negotiations respecting China and
hasten the withdrawal of foreign troops
from the Celestial empire are the subject
of an official note, a copy of which has
just been received in Washington and.
which contains the first complete official
statement of the course of the Russian
Government that has been made.
The statement of Russia's policy was
made simultaneously with her official dec
laration that "while maintaining the pres
ent temporary situation in Manchuria in
order to preserve peace throughout the
vast territory adjoining her frontier and
following out with absolute fidelity her
original intentions which she has openly
declared again and again, the Imperial
Government Is content to await calmly
the march of events." It declares in ef
fect that throughout the Chinese trouble
Russia has kept steadily in view the fact
that in sending her troops into China no
hostile Intent was entertained toward
China; on the -contrary, their presence
was for the purpose of rendering effective
aid to the Government of China in its
struggle aeainst insurgents.
The note is a lengthy review of diplo
matic developments, beginning with the
steps taken by the powers to seek an un
derstanding at the outset of the alarming
occurrences in China last year. The note
states explicitly that, "contrary to the ad
vice of certain jiowers," Russia declared
openly from the beginning- that she was
not at war with the Chinese empire. The
statement continues:
Sz>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA; Wash., May 12.â Passengers
arriving from Alaska on the steamer Vic
torian report that heroic measures are
being taken at . Wrangel, Ketchikan, Ju
"neau, Skagway and Haines to prevent an
epidemic of smallpox in those towns.
Their statements are corroborated by
Captain Roberts of the same steamer. He
says that the towns named have appoint
ed committees of prominent citizens with
authority to take such measures as they
see fit. They have driven all Indiana out
of the towns, sending some back to their
villages * and others into the interior,
where they will have less opportunity of
becoming infected. Medical assistance is
being given, arft efforts are being made
to quarantine all Indian houses which
contain smallpox patients.
Local steamship men- were notified to
day that Vancouver has decided to re
scind all quarantine regulations against
smallpox. The object is to have return
ing Alaska passengers stop there and
thus swell Vancouver's trade. If passen
gers pass Vancouver they will be detained
at the quarantine station at Port Town
send. Vancouver steamship men have
been' making such a strong objection to
American Bteamers. stopping at; Vancou
ver that the Sound shipping men are con
sidering the advisability of having Amer
ican steamers pass Vancouver without
stopping aa lopg as the quarantine is en
forced at Port Townsend.

Conflicting Tales Told by
Grace Winter's Hus
band.
LOS ANGELES. May 12.â The death of
Grace Winters will be officially investi
gated by a Coroner's to-morrow. It
developed to-day that there was an insur
ance of $1000 on her life.
When first arrested the young man as
serted that his wife accidentally shot her
self while crawling under a barbed wire
fence, dragging his shotgun with her.
Since then he has told half a dozen dif
ferent stories. His last is as follows:
"My wife and I started out yesterday
morning for a little hunting. We drove
out to a place near the East Side slaugh
ter house and come to a barley field,
where I hitched the horse to a post and
held the barbed wires of the fence apart
so my wife could crawl through. I then
went back to the buggy for a pair of old
shoes, and while I was lacing them my
wife called out that there were some
doves in sight and I jumped out of the
i buggy, took my gun, cocked both barrels
and started to crawl through the fence.
My sleeve caught in the barbed wire and
the gun was discharged while I was in a
stooping posture between the second and
third wires of the fence. My wife was
standing about six feet from the fence at
the time and at the report of the gun she
fell wtihout a word and I brought her
home in the buegy."
Detective Aubie, who has visited the
scene of the tragedy and carefully exam
ined the surroundings, declares that if the
gun had been discharged while Winters
was in a stooping position, as he- relates,
and his wife six feet away, the shot. would
have entered the woman's head or neck
or passed harmlessly over her head, and
that, in any case, its range would have
been upward. The autopsy showed that
the shot took a downward course at an
angle of forty-five degrees. â .
. While the woman was lying dead at her
home on Workman street Winters called
on Ed Ingraham, a bartender, with whom
he had left the insurance policy on his
wife's life, and notified him" that he
would need it. He also called on the in
surance company and consulted with
them In regard to the payment of the pol
icy. Detectives are working on the theory
that the husband committed a murder. /
MRS. McMULLIN'S little Bister,
winsome Gertrude, is the hap
piest girl in all the city. Ger
trude is only 10, but the dignity
of being known as Miss Thomas
is rightfully hers. On the day" preced
ing her wedding Mrs. Mollie gave Ger
trude her visiting cards and her plate.
"You are Miss Thomas now," she said
to the pretty golden-haired child, and lit
tle Miss Thomas was happy beyond ex
pression. ';-.,v^'V>':
I knew Mollle Thomas would make a
magnificent bride, but she was stun
ning beyond my greatest hopes.' J Her
gown was regal, and she wore it as only
Mollie Thomasâ I beg her pardon, as only
Mollle McMullinâ can. When she came
in on the arm of her father, all shimmer
ing in white satin and with that im
mense bunch of American Beauty roses
hugged closely to her side, the admiring
"ahs" and "ohs" were thick about her.
Such presents as Mollie Thomas-McMul
lin got! Verily, I believe the merchants'
silver showcases must have looked empty
on the wedding day. A week before the
wedding the presents began to arrive, and
not until the morning of the happy day
did they cease to come.
There were many elegant gowns worn
at the wedding, but to my taste none
was ? more handsome than the wonderful
creation worn by the bride's mother. The
body of the gown was of blue panne vel
vet. The front of the corsage and the
front width of the skirt were of blue
silk, brocaded in blue velvet. of immense
pattern. Corsage and skirt were trim
med with quantities of point applique, the
same lace as graced the bride" s dress.
June 26 is the date set for the wedding
of Mary Scott and Walter Martin. It
is to be a noon wedding, and will be cel
ebrated- at the bride's home at ' Burlin
game. Mary Scott has made her mother
in-law-to-be happy and has joined the
Catholic church, so a Catholic clergyman
will pronounce the binding words.
MisSyScott returned last week from her
Eastern visit. During her stay in New
York she left large orders with
the leading costumers and hatmakers.
Her trousseau, which certainly will be one
of the handsomest that ever made a Cal
ifornia bride happy, will come entirely
from Eastern workshops.
Only you and I, who have no country
homes, still linger in town. We will stay
over till next week to help in the general
greeting to our President, and then we
will flit to. the mountains or the seaside
and freckle our noses and brown .our
hands and wait with due humility for
the several invitations to house parties
which we know are sure to come.
I know of " more than one girl who
hopes Georgia Hopkins will ask her for
a few days to join in the fun that is al
ways sure to be part and parcel of the
happy summer at the Hopkins place at
Menlo. The Hopkinses are settled at their
home for the season, and have looked al
ready as far ahead as the glorious Fourth.
There are to be skyrockets and boms to
punctuate the birthday of liberty and a
thousand and one surprises for those who
will make up their great big house party.
The Crocketts and. of course, their
charming daughter Caro, are entitled at
their place at Burllngame. There Is al
ways more or less entertaining- going on
at the Crockettsâ affairs that are awfully
jolly and delightfully unostentatious. My
eves are turned expectantly, in the direc
tion of the Crockett place. I hear that it
is there that' the lucky Scott heir will
claim the heart and hand of the blushing
Caro. By the way, I want to state right
here that "blushing Caro" is not a mere
figure of speech. It is downright fact.

Out on Col estreet. co rner of Oak street, opposite the Park Panhandle,
is a building â just finished â^vhich contains 9 flats, not apartments, but dis-
tinctly separate flats; each flat has its own entrance. These flats are for rent,
and the Furniture, Carpets and Curtains are. for saleâ = each_flat_as_a_yvhole.
These flats are open for your inspection to-day (Monday), and all week until
sold, from 9 till 12 a. m. and from 2 to 5 p. m.; also evenings by appointment.
Telephone Private Exchange 604. \ .
It is not a matter of guesswork when we affirm that we are offering each
of these flats for from $5 to $10 less rental per month than any similar flats
could be* rented for at the present time, for it stands to reason that any owner
â¢will gladly accept a low offer when he can lease his whole, building to us for
a whole year â and the benefit is yours.
To sell as low as we are offering the furnishings of the above illustrated
flats, there must be large selling and large_manufacturing in order to get all
the advantages.
Gushing in print would be absurd when simple facts are all we need to
make the deepest impressions.
Each separate flat has been furnished with due regard for price, and we
have, so considered the popular demand that, notwithstanding the extreme'
beauty and intrinsic value of the furnishings, not a single article is above the
ordinary in price.
It will be impossible in print to touch upon some of the most interesting
features of the different styles and coloring in the Furniture, Carpets or Drap-
eries, so complete, so novel and so bewildejjngly beautiful, and we simply say
it must be seen to be appreciated.
Of course, ladies, you are all welcome to look, with no thought of buying
unless you find it to your interest and advantage to do so.

AITXIOTJSI/Sr AWAITING NEWS
FROM MINTSTER LEISHMAN
Has Failed Thus Far to Report to
Government Concerning Turk
ish Postal Trouble.
WASHINGTON. May 12.-Mr. Leishman.
our Minister to Constantinople, up to this
time has not communicated with the State
Department respecting the trouble at the
Turkish capital over the efforts of *he
Porte to suppress the foreign postofnees.
Inquiry here discloses the fact that the
tTnited States is one of the few great
powers which does not maintain an ab
solutely independent postal service be
tween Constantinople and the outside
world. The others have a â¢ system of
closed mail pouches by which "the malls
are not permitted to pass through the
Turkish hands while in transit between
the border and the embassies at Constan
tinople. The British Government has a
fine postoffice building not far from lis
embassy and Austria and " France also
have suitable postal establishments at
Constantinople. These were established
originally not so much from, a lack of
confidence in the integrity of the Turkish
Government as from the inferior charac
ter of the Turkish postal service some
years ago. It is possible for any foreign
citizen resident in Constantinople to re
ceive his mall directly upon
to the postoffice at his embassy. The priv
ilege is not limited to embassy cttaches
or official mail and this fact has long been
a matter of discontent for the Turks, who,
having sought to improve their own pos
tal service by placing It under the direc
tion of German experts, feel that they
have a right to get rid of these foreign
offices, which they claim facilitates mud
dling". TheÂ«_'nited States Government, not
having a postoffice of its own, always has
made use of the facilities of the French
Austrian and British postal system T tti
Constantinople.
More Than One Hundred Persons In

TBOLLEY CAR DASHES
DOWN STEEP GRADE
Fort Lee, N. J.
NEW YORK. May 12.â An open trolley
car in which were packed about .115 per
rons got away from the motorman near
Fort Lee, K. J., to-day and
dashed down Leona Hill. Every
person in the car was bruised
and three were seriously hurt, but only
one of them Is likely to die. Frank Sun
struck, the conductor, it is feared may
lose his life on account of internal In
juries, and J. E. Robinson and his wife of
this city are the two others who were
seriously hurt.
The heavily Isu&en car had started down
an incline a quarter of a mile In length
when the motorman lost control. The car
was going so fast that no one dared Jump
off. The road is a winding one and at the
foot of the hill it curves sharply. When
the front trucks hit the curve they started
around it an<j made it. The rear ones fol
lowed part of the way. The wrench upon
the car, however, as it swung about was
eo great that the body was lifted and
torn from the trucks and rolled over and
hit the ground. The passengers were
caught in and under the car and were
piled In a heap.

American Stocks Fail to

LONDON, May 12.â For the last week
the attention of the stock market has
been so attracted to Americans that lit
tle has been done In locals. Good buying
followed, whereupon the feeling was im
proved. The close in Americans was
firm, but below the level of New York.
There still exists some uneasiness in for
eigners.
The record of the quotations fluctu
ations during the last week is practically
valueless, as they have been so abnormal
that they furnish little valuable indica

an improvement, but 'closed under the

BERLIN, May" 12.â Throughout last
week the German Boerses studied the
Wall street situation with the most in
tense Interest, but with great reserve and
in expectation of a crash. The Frankfur
ter Zeitung now remarks that "the direct
interest of German speculation in Ameri
can securities Is at present not great, and
German bankers have largely reduced
their American holdings of late."
Nevertheless, the paper admits, the
events in Wall street have caused anxiety
in this country because a reaction has
been feared upon European markets. In
common with the Berliner Tageblatt and
other representative journals, the Frank
furter Zeitung interprets the experience
of Wall street during the week as show
ing- the' evils of cash settlements, arguing
that such wild fluctuations would have
been Impossible if sales for future deliv
ery existed. . .
The reaction here Thursday was not
â¢heavy and there was a partial recovery
yesterday.

to Chicago and announced that he has
drawn a line through Chicago and has
disinherited everything and everybody
east of that line from any share in the
money he still expects to give away. Not
.one penny. Dr. Pearsons says, ever will go
to any- institution east of Chicago. The
million or two dollars that he intends to
dispose of within the next year are all
for the "West.
Dr. Pearsons' statement was drawn out
partly by the visit of a trustee of Mtddle
burj' (Vt.) College, who came here to seek
an addition to his endowment fund.
"I came back from Missouri with my
mird made- up," said Dr. Pearsons to 'a
reporter. "I have drawn a line north and
south through Chicago and I shall never
ko east of thnt line. 3 have not forgotten
Chicago and I am going to do something
handsome for the city before long. I have
my plans all laid now." . :Â¦ ,~ â¢

business ,in Chicago. Hereafter he will
devote himself ' to 'gardening," raising
chickens . and driving about the country
near his place at Hinsdale.

When darkness fell* the glare from the
burning poles illuminated the sky for
miles. The firemen worked on the fire
almost all night to keep it from spread-
Ing to other property, for they realized
that It would simply have to burn itself
out In the Western Union storage yards.
While this fire was. burning the lumber
yard of G. A. Raupf & Co.. in Ecorse,
about a mile from Delray. was set on nre
by sparks from a passing engine, and 500.
000 feet of lumber destroyed. The loss is
about $75,000, covered by insurance.
The plant of the Maltby Lumber Com
pany was the last on the river bank, and
it was soon destroyed, together with a
large stock of cedar poles which was
etored In the "company's yard.
From the Brownlee property the flre
jumped over into the large yard which
the Western Union Telegraph Company
used as a storage' point for its telegrapn
poles*. The yard is the distributing point
for ten States, and over 100,009 poles were
stored there. The fire swept through the
great yard, which comprises about eight
acres, in less than two hoursA-but the
l>ole.s blazed until far into the nig-ht. The
streams from the fireboat Battle were
centered on the yard, but they had no
effect In staying the flame?. The four
inch streams were turned into steam al
most before they reached the burning
piles of poles.
Delrav has a very small fire depart
ment. It responded with three engines
and the fireboat Battle. "Even the great
Ftreams of the fireboat were powerless
to check the flames, which were rolling
down the river bank for hundreds of feet.
DETROIT, May 12.â Fanned by a thirty
fivo rni'e an hour wind, fire this after
noon swept the west bank of the Rouse
River i:i Delray, a suburb to the , south
of Detroit, fcr three-quarters of a mile,
and destroyed over $800,000 worth of
property. Following are the losses: Sal
liotte &. Ferguson, lumber mill. SjO.QDO,
covered by insurance; Brownlee &. Com
pany's sawmill* Salt block and part of
their lumber, 515,000. insurance $15,000; the

at Salliotte & Ferguson's dock, $70,000,
insurance unknown; Ma!tby Lumber Com
pany, cedar poles and sawmill, $I>Q,000, in

The fire originated shortly after 1 o clock
on the roof of the Sa'liotte & Ferguson
lumber mill. The mill had not been run
ning for several months, and the roof
was as dry as tinder. The building was
soon in ashes, and the tire swept across

u;>. Despite efforts to save her, this craft

Diseases and
, Weakness of
f MEN ONLY'
Un the various forms of general
debility, and convalescence following certain
diseases, such is the lowered standard of tha
vital processes that the function of no organ is
perfectly performed, and. with the resulting de-i
presslon'the patient has a REAL weakness.
The physician's first thought, under these con-
ditions, is nerve and other tonics.
Not. Weakness ; Symptoms
By far the greater number of patients, how-
ever,' seeking reUef for . so-called "Weakness"
is furnished by healthy and robust men. On
examination, we find a Prostate Gland which
has been damaged by either a contracted dis-
. order or early dissipation. These patients
have no weakness' at all. Prematureness, Loss
of Vitality, etc., are the symptoms, or disor-
dered function, of the chronically inflamed
prostate srland. We find by curing this inflam-
mation that full vigor - at once . returns. ' It
should be understood that, tonics, electricity,
etc., might cure a real weakness, but would do -
harm In inflammation. The main object is to
reduce the size of the tender, swollen and in-
flamed prostate. . This we accomplish by local
treatment, thus avoiding drugs. Men who havo
unsuccessfully treated for a weakness should
now understand the cause of failure.' Â¦Â¦ , â¢

SOME OF THOSE WHO WILL AID IN
THE BOYS' ASSEMBLY FEI*E.
ALAMEDA. May 12.-The funds of
the Boys' Assembly need replen
ishing, and that is the reason why
the lady managers of that organ
ization have announced a fete for
next Saturday at the Thompson grounds
on Hijrh street. It takes a lot of money,
the ladies find, to run a boys' club, and so
long as there is a stringency it Is impos-
Fible to enlarge. The money they got a
while ago from the business men of. the
city has been spent. Now the board of
directors wants to begin as soon as possi
ble classes and clubs to meet the require
ments of all sorts of boysâ boys who do
not get the ordinary advantages. The
ladies want to give them lessons in his
tory and parliamentary law and a num
ber of other things, but they cannot go
arcad without money.
TTie f*te is colr.e to be a wonderful
Wheelmen Bide Exciting Races.
SACRAMENTO. May 12.-The Velo
firome races drew a crowd of 3000 people
this evening-, and the events, all ama
teurs, created Intense enthusiasm. The
final of the mile amateur handicap was
won by Brown. O. P. \V.. who stole the
pole from the leaders. Pearson second,
and Ventor third. Time. 2:09 3-5. Back
rath won both heats of the five-mile motor
noced race. Pasch second. Time. 9:10.
There are to be elsrht booths, so it will
be pretty hard to Ret out of the grounds
without buying something:. Most of the
articles have been donated, which means
100 per cent pront for the ladles. The most
notable rifts were those of the artists of
Alameda. who sketched and painted
scenes within the city limits purposely for
the eouvenir booth. The booths are under
the sunervislon of the following named:
thing In its way. It will look something
like the Presidio looked just after war
was declared aeainst the Spaniards, so
dotted with tents will the Thompson
grounds be. Not alone will the booths be
under canvas but there will be a series of
tents where the visitor can go and have
a little picnic or reunion on Â¦ the Bide.
There will be no need for other decora
tion either, for at this time of the year
nature does all Its own decorating in the
Thompson grounds. Roses and carnations
and every conceivable blossom is there.
One of the unusual things will be the
tallyho. Tallyhos are scarce in Alameda.
This one will have a regular route on the
fete day and carry people to the grounds
for 10 cents. Its route will be from the
fountain at Morton street along Central
avenue to the grounds. Charles Fletter

DEMANDS WATER
FOR PROTECTION
The Haywards Board
of Trade Protests
Against Delays. .
Oakland Office San 'Trancisco Call,
1118 Broadway. May 12.
The failure of the San Lorenzo Water
Company of Haywards to heed the pro
tests of the Board of Trustees of Hay
wards in the matter of establishing water
mainland hydrants since the burning of
Hunt Bros." 'cannery has led the Hav
wards Board of Trade to take the mat
ter in hand and to address a vigorous let
fer of warning to the corporation.
The citizens are enraged that the re
quired protection against another such
fire should not be afforded. To the lack
of water and pipes was attributed in
large measure the complete destruction of
the cannery. Now the work of rebuilding
the plant is in progress. Thousands of
dollars' worth of Inflammable materials
are piled on the ground and' there is not
a drop of water yet available for protec-
The people demanded that a main and
flre hydrants be put in on B street to pro
tect the cannery. According to the state
ments of President P. Wllbert of the
Board of Trade not a move has been made
by the company. The board Instructed
the president to communicate with the
water company at once. In accordance
with those instructions the followins let
ter has been sent to the corporation:

Mr * B. Pierce, President of the San Lorenzo
Water Company, 722 Montgomery street. San
Francisco, Cal. :
Dear Sirâ At a regular meeting of the Hay
wards Board of Trade held May 8, 1901, the
matter of the delay in the completion of the
water pipe line and flre hydrants at the Hay
wards Cannery, thereby connecting the new 1
cannery building with the city water works,
came under discussion, and resulted in a mo
tion and unanimously carried, that the presi
dent of the board be appointed a committee of
one to send a communication to the president
of the water company. aaÂ«!ng why this work
had not been completed. The loss of this vast
industry by flre but a few weeks ago, when

do anything to stop the conflagration from the
lack of water, is still in their minds, and
naturally much apprehension is felt lest, the
new building, which ia rapidly nearing com
pletion, might go the same as the first before
the water system, which the City Council has
ordered completed, Is even begun, ; owing to
the dilatory tactics of the water company. The
feelings of the citizens are so harassed by the
tardy action of the company that the agita
tion for a' municipal â¢ ownership of city water
will not go long, unheeded. The community,
through their Board of Trade, desire to enter
their solemn protest ! to further unnecessary
delay In the completion of this work for the
protection of this most important industry.
Thanking you in advance for your prompt at
tention to this matter and hoping that you
will see the Justice of our demand and be will

Leahy's Injuries are on the left side of
his head, and he was lying on that side
when the police found his unconscious
form. There was a severe scalp wotpd,
a cash of at least five inches, which
might have been caused by striking the
sharp edge of the steel railway tracks.
Beneath the ugly cut was the fracture, a
bad compound and comminuted break
in the skull. Leahy regained his senses
very slowly. The fact that he did recover
his faculties at all Is an excellent surgi
cal indication that the operation relieved
all of the pressure upon the brain.
Leahy's residence Is at 1203 Twenty
fourth avenue.
The detectives are inclined to believe
that Leahy fell and struck his! head on
the railroad tracks, while stumbling along
the roadway in an intoxicated condition.
That apptars to be the correct solution.
That Leahy was not crushed to death
under the wheels of a passing freight
train is remarkable. How long he had
been lying- on the tracks he does not know
nor could the police get any information
that would clear up the mystery. There
was no evidence, except the injuries them
selves, to indicate foul play. What per
sonal effects the younjr man had were all
intact. He missed nothing and . does not
believe he was struck down for purposes
of robbery.
Leahy could not say whether â¢ he had
been fighting or quarreling during his
wanderings, and the police cannot say
whether he was clubbed and knocked in
sensible by some unknown man, who
might have Quarreled with him-
Lying between the Southern Pacific rail
road tracks, unconscious and bleeding,
with his skull fractured and a deep gash
in his scalp, William Leahy, a boilermak
er, 19 years old, was found by the police
at Twenty-third avenue crossing at 2:30
o'clock this morning. The injured man
was hurried to the Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. R. T. Stratton attended the pa
tient, trephining the skull to relieve the
pressure on the brain, and in all probabil
ity saving the young man's life.
Leahy does not know how he sustained
the injury. When he regained conscious
ness to-day, he had no recollection of any
events subsequent to his departure from
a saloon on Twenty-third avenue, where
he had been drinking heavily during the
evening. *

RAS CLOSE CALL
"I discovered sufficient evidence to .con
vince me that the boy had been misused.
When the father and the marshal came to
my residence I told them I didn't know
where the boy was. and that is a fact. I
had supposed that the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children'had taken
him, . pending, an Investigation."
Dr. W. Allen Bald: "My connection with
this matter is simply that I was requested
as a member of the school board to make
an investigation to ascertain, why the
child was not attending school: I learned
that the boy was in the hands of Mrs.
Rose, who was taking care of the little fel
fow. He had told her. ho did notdarei to
go home because he would be beaten to
death. . j
Mr. Bird has submitted the circumstances to
a cromlnent flrm of Oakland attorneys and
now they are considering- the advisability of
submitting the case to the next Grand Jury
or of immediately proceeding against all i the
parties who were responsible for the kidnap
ing of the Bird child. Dr. Allen's position in
the matter Is puzzling the Birds and Marshal
Kerns of Berkeley very much. On Friday
morning Dr. Allen telephoned Marshal Kerns
that he knew where the. child could be found,
but on Sunday morning, when Kerns brought
the doctor out of his bed and demanded of
Allen the whereabouts of young B:.-d. the doc
tor flatly refused to give any information.
Walter Bird has been connected for many
years with the Southern Pacific headquarters
in San Francisco. Many of hi* influential
friends connected with the company have
offered him all the assistance In their power
to. unravel the mystery surrounding the abduc
tion of his boy.
Bird to-night prepared, under the advice
of his attorneys, a written statement,
which is as follows: ' , ,
: The parent insists he will run to the
last thread every circumstance surround
ing the affair, with particular reference
to the actions of Dr. W. Allen and of Mrs.
Rose.
This occurred in ' the ' face of the fact
that the Birds reside directly across the
street from the Rose dwelling. Mr. Bird
is up in arms because of Mrs. Rose's story
of persecution to the child, who, she as
serted, had run away from home becauso
of ill treatment. The angry father has not
only enlisted the aid of the legal depart
ment of the county, but he has retained
private counsel to go into the case.
BERKELEY, May 12.â W. M. Bird, fath
er of seven-year-old Harry Bird, whose
disappearance and recovery were marked
by peculiar circumstances, has appealed
to District Attorney Allen for a thor
ough official investigation of the conduct
of Mrs. J. J. Rose, neighbor of the Birds,
who kept the child four days without tell
ing the distracted parents where he was
hidden.

they will be cremated, such being the ex
pressed desire of Judge Boalt before his
death.
The rooms of the Boalt home were filled
with a mass of floral pieces, tokens from
hundreds of friends.' The casket was al
most hidden beneath them. Among the
many friends of the deceased lawyer
present, including a number of the most
prominent attorneys of the California bar;
were his former associates. Judge John

the wishes of the family the services were
as simple as possible. There were no pall
bea/ers and the words of prayer and eu
logy from the lips of Rev. J. K. McLean
were few. though very impressive. Dr.
McLean first read the Congregational

reviewing his association with him and
telling of the high esteem In which he
was held for- many noble acts. â¢

Nome Mining King and Three
of His Friends Are
Injured.
Â¦ ' Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 12.
By the upsetting of an automobile run
ning at full speed Erik O. Lindblom. the
Nome mining king, was seriously Injured
this afternoon at the corner of Telegraph
avenue and Stuart street, Berkeley.
Lindblom was operating the machine
when it capsized, throwing: him and three
companions headlonp: into the street and
turning on top of them. To add to the
seriousness of the accident, the machine
caught fire and threatened to cremate the
imprisoned men, until, happily, an em
ploye of an automobile agency happened
along and extinguished the flames, at the
same time stopping the machinery that
was whirring at top speed. >A
The four men were dragged from under
the auto and sent to Lindblom's residence
at Farker and Hillegass streets, Berkeley,
where they were given such medical at
tention as the Injuries required. Lind
blom was seriously cut and bruised about
the head and face. He was ordered to
bed and the house attendants refused to
allow him to be seen. 'They declined to
give the identity of Lindblom's compan
ions, asserting that they were only casual
acquaintances, whose names the injured
chaffeur did not know.
The machine was a total wreck, being
smashed beyond repair, judging from its
appearance as it lay in the ditch at the
street crossing 1 .
The primary cause of the accident was
a eust of wind that blew Lindblom's hat
, off while he was racing down Telegraph
avenue aealnst an electric car. The auto
was running at a very high speed. When
the hat sailed off Lindblom started to turn
about to go after his headgear. Without
slacking the speed of the machine he
twisted it around. The forward wheels
struck the street car tracks on an angle
and over went the machine and the x>ccu
pants into the street.
Lindblom's companions were not so
badly hurt as he was. but all four were
shaken up and are much the worse for the
experience.

With an Exciting
Accident.
CAUGHT BENEATH
AN AUTOMOBILE
In many respects Mr. Brayton had a re
markable career. He was the son of A.
P. Brayton, one of the founders of the
Pacific Iron 'Works of San Francisco. The
young man was born In Oakland thirty
four years ago. He was educated In thÂ©
public schools of this city and at a pri
vate institution in the East. With an
hereditary tendency, the youth decided to
become a mechanic and entered his
father's machine shops as an apprentice,
serving his time at forge and lathe until
he was graduated as a skilled Journey
man. This experience stood him In good
hand. With his father and brother he
took hold of the Pelton water wheel, a de
vice which by his own well directed tech
nical and commercial skill he developed
as one of the great mechanical inventions
of the day. After securing patents and
starting preliminaries Mr. Brayton placed
the wheel on the market, and it Is now
known throughout the world.
On the social side his successes were as
notable. A patron of the clubs, he ranked
among the most popular men whose
faces are familiar at the Bohemian Club
across the bay and among the Athenians
in Oakland. His standing here is attested
by the fact that he was a president of the
Athenian Club, and his administration
was one of note. To intimates he was
Bert Brayton. a splendid companion and a
true friend. There will be many who will
miss his frank and pleasant personality
and many will sincerely mourn with the
bereaved parents and brother.
The family la one of the oldest In this
county. An uncle was the head of the
Brayton school, which was the forerunner
of the University of California. Mr. Bray
ton was unmarried. His brother Is E. L.
Brayton. He was affiliated with the Ma
sonic fraternity. The funeral arrange
ments have not been completed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 12.
A. P. Brayton Jr., manager of the Pel
ton Water Wheel Company of San Fran
cisco, prominent In the Industrial affairs
of the State, a leader In Oakland social
and club life, a stanch friend, genial and
warm-hearted, passed away to-night at
6:40 o'clock at his residence, 1167 Jackson
street, after an Illness of only five days.
He was attacked by pneumonia.
The shock occasioned by the announce
ment of the death of the young business
man was most profound. The suddenness
of the untimely call added to the distress
which will fill many hearts when the wide
circle of friends learns the sad tidings.
Taken ill last . Tuesday, Mr. Brayton be
came steadily worse. Dr. A. Liliencrantz
was summoned, and all of the skill that
medical science could command was ex
erted. Last night the patient was so
much feebler that Dr. P. L. "Wheeler was
called Into consultation. ,â¢..â¢.,.:.

ports. Last week the underwriters were
offering 5 per cent to reinsure their risks
on the British ships Leicester Castle,
Halewood, Morven, Maio, Naiad and Paul
Rickmers. The Leicester Castle and Hale
wood have arrived at their destination,
but the Morven is now out 159 and Maipo
156 days from Astoria. Naiad 146 days
from Victoria, B. C, and Paul Rickmers
146 days from Vancouver, B. C, all for
England. Just why reinsurance should
be paid on any of these vessels is hard
to surmise, as none of them are really
overdue.
The Manchester, now out 263. days from
New York for Yokohama, is quoted at
90 per cent, while the Rydemere, now but
67 , days from Marseilles for Melbourne,
Australia, is ouoted at the same figure.
Twelve days after the latter vessel sailed
from France she was spoken in latitude
36 north, longitude 2 west, and was then
on â¢ her beam ends. Nothing has; been
heard from her since. -. Â»-_ â¢
The Overdue Fleet.
The Munchen was built in Glasgow by
the Fairfleld Company in 1889, and was
2855 tons net burden, 387 feet 5 inches long,
46 feet 7 inches beam and 3 feet deep. :
The wrecked steamer is the Munchen,
and, according to private advices received
in this city,' she was opening a service be
tween Sydney, N. S. W., and the Caro
lines, connecting at Hongkong with the
North German Lloyds. The Munchen
was at Yap, -when a storm- came up, and
she was driven ashore. The bottom was
torn out or badly punctured. The crew
and cargo were saved, but as there are
no appliances in the Carolines for float
ing a large ship nothing could be done
toward saving the hull. The news re
ceived^-here .is dated March. 30, ..and- at
that time the cruiser Kormoran had not
reached Yap. Â»Â¦ . â¢â¢ . -. . V-
The Norddeutscher Lloyd-venture in the
Southern Seas has not opened auspicious
ly. Its first steamship has been wrecked
in the/Caroline group, and will probably
be a total ipssT. The German cruiser
Kormoran has gone from Australia Â¦ â¢ to
render assistance, but it is feared that the
vessel cannot be saved. â¢ .

his father's ark near Carmen
Island last Saturday and .has not been
seen since. His father and mother are
almost crazed with grief, as they fear
the little fellow has fallen, into one of the
numerous creeks in the marshes and been
drowned.
J. B. Henrioulle, the boy's father, the
well-known proprietor of the liquor store
at 19 Ninth street, accompanied by b'a
son Louis, J. B. Saddler and J. Brown,
left for a fishing trip last Friday. Henri

to a spot some distance from the ark
where fishing was good, leaving the boy
and Brown on the craft.
Late in the afternoon the fishermen re
turned and were informed by Brown of
the disappearance of Louis, for whom,
he said, he had been searching 1 for some
time. The anxious . father. Saddler and
Brown continued the . search during the
entire night, but met with no success.
Henrioulle returned. to this city Sunday,
enlisted the services of a brother and sev
eral friends, and returned to the marshes.
The search was prosecuted vigorously,
but the missing boy was not found. The
distracted' father clings fondly to .he hope
that. the boy, who is an enthusiastic col
lector of insects, strolled away from the
ark in search of some new specimens,
lost his way when he attempted to return
and may still be wandering about the

Infuriated Woman, Charged
With Theft, Attempts
Â« Murder.
2"vvo xrcll dressed Â¦women, one armed
with a Distol, which she threatened to
use. and the other vociferously calllns: for
the police to protect her life, created no
end cf excitement at Bush and Mason
btrects shortly after 11 o'clock Saturday
niorning. The woman who held the re
volver is known as Mrs. Steiner. It is
paid that she recently arrived here from
the East. Her rival, whose life she
threatened to take, is known as May Rey
nolds. The last named was walking along
Mason street when she was suddenly con
fronted by Mrs. Steiner, who had the pis
tol concealed under her wrap.
* - l want 10 know if you accuse me of
tstcaiing your jewelry?" angrily asked the
woman, approaching her trembling vic
tim.
"i'ou were seen with the jewelry on
you," nervously answered Mrs. Reynolds,
â¢'so I concluded that you invrjt have stolen
"You lie when you say so!" exclaimed
Mrs. Steir.er. exposing the revolver and
porting it at her cowering accuser, "i
ut'uht 10 blow your head off."
becoming alarmed at tÂ»ie sight of the
pittol, Mrs. Reynolds ran into a grocery
siore on the corner and appealed to the
proprietor for protection.
"Don't let her kill me," she pltifully
pleaded. "For God's sake take her away."
Trembling with rage, Mrs. Steiner re
mained outside, waiting for Mrs. Rey
nolds to reappear. Seeing that she was
tent on injuring her accuser the grocer
accosted her and emphatically told her
that unless she at once left the scene he
would telephone for a policeman.
After roundly abusing the woman who
had escaped her wrath Mrs. Steiner
walked down Mason street and soon dis
appeared. * After she had left Mrs. Rey
iiolds, fearing that she was lurking .in the
neighborhood, intending to kill her. tele
phoned to a male friend, asking" him to
meet her at the grocery store. He ap
peared shortly afterward and at her re-
Quest escorted her home.
Mrs. Reynolds to-day intends to swear
to a complaint against Mrs. Steiner,
charging her with exhibiting a deadly
weapon and threatening her life.
About a week aeo Mrs. Reynolds lost
some valuable jewelry and she suspected
Mrs. Steiner. with whom she was on
friendly terms, of having stolen it.- She
confided her suspicions to a friend, who
lost no timej in notifying Mrs. Steiner.
Furious with rape, that woman procured
a revolver and started out with the deter
mination to wreak vengeance upon her
accuser. Â¦

his reappearance in the new piece. Jos

"Barbara Frietchie" opened to a packed
house last niirht at the California, and
scored an emphatic hit. While the long
waits between acts lengthened the per
formance out beyond the point of com
fort, that fault probably will be remedied
to-night. The piece abounds with strong
scenes, and after the last act has been
furbished up a bit the play will be one
well worth seeing. The cast is in the
capable hands of the Neill company, of
which Edyth Chapman, as Barbara, eas
ily carried off the honors. Neill as Captain
Trumbull was quietly effective, and,
though Julia Dean as Sue Royce has very
little to do, she does that little well. Don
ald Bowles as Jack Negly gives a virile
interpretation of the part, and the rest of
the company are good as usual.

The new people at the Orpheum were
kindly greeted by a packed house last
night. The Agoust "family quarrel"- is as
wonderfully funny as ever, and Mclntyre
and Heath have not lost any of their
powers of amusing. The four Huntings,
Zeb. and Zarrow, Patterson brothers.
Ingham, Barnes and Sisson, Alf Grant
and the biograph all came in for their
share of the applause.

Hugh' Lewis, an elevator attendant at
the St. Nicholas . Hotel, had an exceeding
ly narrow escape yesterday from being
dashed to pieces at the foot of the eleva
tor shaft. Only his presence of mind and
the proximity of the ropes which are used
to hoist the cage saved his life.
Lewis had taken the elevator up to the
second story of the building and was
standing with his back to it, when the bell
rang,' summoning him to again resume his
post. Without turning- to look and all un
conscious that in the meantime the ele
vator had of its own accord risen to the
story above, he stepped backward into
the shaft. ' There was nothing: between,
him; and the bottom, of the shaft, two
stories below.
After he had fallen almost a story
Lewis managed to grasp the ropes which
are suspended from the cage. Â¦ His mo
mentum at the time was so great that he
could not entirely check himself and so
he slid down the ropes to the bottom,
tearing the flesh from his hands, but es
caping serious injury.
His hands were injured to. such an ex
tent that it was- necessary for him to go
to the Emergency Hospital and have
them dressed.
He was unable to explain how' the ele
vator had ascended without being start
ed by some one. ,' - . '

'The^strike of the Cooks' and Walters'
Alliance remains practically in' the same
innocuous condition as it has for the past
three or four days. The unexpected ad

apparently disrupted arrangements hith

A meeting of the San Francisco Labor
Council was held yesterday morning at
the Turk-street Temple. .The session was
executive, and- no definite result following
the policy outlined on Friday, night last
obtained. There were many warm dispu
tations among the delegates,, and it was
decidedin view of existing conditions â¢ to
refer, the matter to the executive com
mittee with full power to ac*t. Many; of
the" members discussed the situation and.
reviewed the history of , the strike. The
executive committee will now- take the
matter in hand and. endeavor to arbitrate,
if possible, with a view of preventing any
new complications. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ .
The Journeymen Bakers held a; meeting
at the same time and prepared a schedule
of wages and hours.' This *dll be pre
sented to the boss bakers. The*Â«mployes
of five more bakeries- were ordered out.
It was decided that no "bakery, goods"
should be delivered to unfair houses. It
was - also decided when - any bakery pro
prietor should sign an agreement that his
men would be' paid union wages the men
should be allowed to return to -work. In
accordance with this action five, more
bakeries'have been declared "fair." Â¦Â¦
The executive committee of the Labor
Council decided to rest on its oars pend
ing further developments. Secretary
Rosenberg expressed the hope that a gen
eral strike might be averted. He declined
to give any further public utterance to
his opinion in the matter, saying that the
situation was fully explained in yesterday
morningjs Call.
The executive committee of the Team
ster's Union also met and considered tha
situation but took no definite action.
Some of the unions that have heretofore
held aloof from the waiters' strike are
said to be" in readiness to unite in the
general cause. But it is not expected that
any general boycott or strike will take
place.- The- influx of so many strangers
into the city to honor the President has
made labor valuable, and the members of
the Restaurant Proprietors' Association
are engaging every man and woman that
comes along., A dispassionate review of
the situation leaves both parties to the
controversy In practically the same situa
tion. The proprietors are ready to en
gage the people, and'all who want to work
can 'secure employment at slightly higher
wages than before.
Laborers Indorse Strike.
The Laborers' Protective Union initiated
forty 'members- yesterday, making a total
of 310 on the roll. I Thirty applications are
on. file. The. strike of the Cooks' and
