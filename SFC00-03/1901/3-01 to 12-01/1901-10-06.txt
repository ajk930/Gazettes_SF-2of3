Mrs. Roosevelt was Miss Edith Kennlt
Carow, and her family has been friendly
\u25a0with the Roosevelta for generations. Her
father was Charles Carow, son of Isaao

It is too early yet to speak of how and
what entertainments are to be given, bat
with the first lifting of the cloud that
hangs over the country, and especially
the White House, the irrepressible young
life of so happy a household is bound to
work its way, and that way will never be
one with which fault can be found.
Mrs. Roosevelt .will not, so say her
friends, advocate any sweeping innova
tions at the White House, but there will
be just as much to learn from the way in
which she performs her dutie3 as leading
lady as in the very recent times when, as
hostess at Albany or at the summer house
at Oyster Bay, she lived her own life,
quite unmoved by criticism or by the ex
ample of those around her whose Incomes
permitted more show and more luxury of
life. â¢, - v ' ;^, ' \u25a0

Of course there is no time set as to
when the formal Introduction of Miss
Roosevelt will take place, but.it may
safely be assumed that she will have an
unusually brilliant winter for a debu
tante, and Mrs. Roosevelt haa moat caro
fully planned h<?T trousseau, which now
will simply need some additions. Already
what Miss Roosevelt is to be 13 belnjj
talked over, showing that the personal
interest Is not to be lost sight of in tha
sudden accession of public interest that
must needs come in such a. tremendous
change of circumstances.
The world at large will have little op
portunity to cavil now at American social
life. There has come to an end with tha
recent tragedy a most wonderfui exhi
bition cf a husband's love and tenderness,
a devotion rarely if ever equaled, but
now as leading lord and lady of the land
are a married couple v,-hosÂ»-devotion to
one another and to their children ha3 been
to every one who knew them an exampla
of the happiest possible married life and
of how a .-woman can sink herself in her
husband's aims without at the same tlmo
losing. her own individuality.
President and Mrs. Roosevelt are tha
voungest couple who have ever occupied
the "White House, and they, with their
children, will unquestionably transform- it
in many ways. But as a nation we can
not fail to , be glad that the office has
fallen to a man and woman who*e alms
are high and whose earnest love for one
another has been known to all their
friends.
The first lady of the land comes from a
long line cf ancestors well accustomed to
social life, and a3 a young girl she was a
great favorite in society not only in this
count ry but abroad. She la thoroughly
well posted as to social etiquette, and
there will never be a mistake made as to
the order of precedence, but the formality
that must needs rule will be much miti
gated by the indescribable charm of thÂ«
home life which will dominate every
thing, as it always has done.
"When It was first planned to Introduce
Miss Roosevelt In Washington this win
ter all the details of her debut were most
carefully planned. These will of neces
sity be somewhat changed, but an effort
will be made as far. as possible to follow
the lines that were laid down, and one
may be sure that Mrs. Roosevelt Intends
to fulfill to the letter her duties a3 chap
eron and mother.
Miss Roosevelt's Introduction.
Always a Social Tavorite.
As Is well known. President and Mrs.
Roosevelt have not been people of large
mean?, and have certainly never lived be
yond those means. Last winter when his
term of Governor was over and befor*
the inauguration In March, they kept the
house open at Oyster Bay, although all
their neighbors had long since gone into
town. The children attended school then
and the governess was retained, but the
home iife went on exactly as though It
wa3 from choice that they stayed there,
and to-day the verdict of the children is
that there never wa3 a pleasanter winter.
The Roosevelt turnout is a most demo
cratic one. The coachman ' is certainly
not up to the accepted standards of smart
society, for he nas a mustache, and there
Is no footman or second man. It has al
ways pleased both Mr. -and- Mrs. Roese-,
velt to live their lives independent of any
changes of fashion or of popular feeling,
and the heme has been from time Imme
morial the typical American home. In, 'tha
best sense of the word, and yet thefe is
no doubt that when at the White House,
with the necessary formality that the po
sition must needs bring, the President
and Mrs. Roosevelt will carry .out In
every detail the social as well as the poli
tical demands made upon them.
Of Modest Means.

No matter how busy and how full her
life may be some portion cf tha day is
always put apart for absolute quiet, and
certain hours are devoted exclusively to
her children, who receive' probably tha
tenderest care and attention that have
ever been lavished upon children in their
position in life. Their Interests are bers
and she la more like an elder sister than
a mother to them, while in time of Ill
ness, no matter how good a trained
nurse she may have, the greater part of
the nursing falls upon her.
An Ideal wife and mother she was often
called, and rightly, at tha time of the
Spanish war. She never made any com
plaint, never showed any signs of anxiety
excepting: that those who knew her in
timately saw her grow visibly paler and
thinner, but she never broke down until
after her husband had returned from the
war, and during that time she was en
tirely with her children, her one endeavor
seeming to be to prevent any sadness
coming to them.

Once in a while it dawns upon the in

brocade is Just the ticket. -With a black
background the wear and tear does not

make the design more noticeable, a nar

The underneath, ruffle .has two narrow
black ribboned ruffles that show plainly
through tho zigzags. '
As light skirts have - been so popular,

Sir Gervaise Clifton, whose history of
Jamaica is one of the finest books of Its
kind in existence, married no less than
seven times, and each time selected his
lady from among his domestic servants.
The seventh Lady Clifton outlived h.er

Thomas Day, the author of the famous
book, "Sanford and Merton," selected two
girls, one from a poorhouse and one from
a foundling asylum, and took them into
his house as domestics. He proposed to
both of them in turn. One rejected his
suit. The other promised to marry him,
but subsequently withdrew her promise
on account of his eccentricities. Day,
however, admired the girl's courage and
settled a dowry of $2500 upon her, at the.
same time deciding to remain a bachelor.

GREAT MEN WHO HAVE
MARRIED SERVANT GIRLS
THE man out West who caused hia
family great pain and anger the oth
er day by marrying his servant girl
can plead the example of many cele
brated men as an extenuation or a Justi
fication of his act. There waa "William
Cobbett, the great writer and the "liber
ator of the English press," as he Is fre
quently called. He was only 21 years of
age when, walking cut in the streets ot
Halifax. Nova Scotia, one morning, he
chanced to see a buxom servant girl bus
jly engaged in washing the family linen.
The girl, though only 13 years of age, wa3
pretty, so Cobbett spoke to her, learned
her name, and the same evening called
upon her parents and said he would like
to marry their daughter. This is probably
the origin of the expression, "This is so
sudden," which blushing maidens have
made use of ever since. The parents of
the girl informed the young man that
they had no objection to him as a son
in-law, but that-he would have to wait
until their daughter was of a marriage
able age. Accordingly Cobbett gave tha
girl all the money he had, which amount
ed to $700, and she went to England and
became a domestic in the family of a
clergyman. Five years later Cobbett re
turned to England and married her.
Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of New
South Wales, is another example. OnÂ»
night, when dining at a friend's house,
he was struck by the appearance of a
servant girl who waited upon the table,
and persuaded his host to allow her to
enter his employ. This she did, and for
a short time held the position of cook in
Sir Henry's household. Then his love for
her overcame all conventionalities and ha
made her Lady Parkes.

Peattie then continues: "What that ex
perience was it has been pastime to imag
ine. So, with no disrespect to the master,
here is the tale, which may or may not
be true."
The tale is poetically conceived and
quaintly phrased, being a sad little love
ptory thoroughly in keeping with the per
sonality of Jacques. The "impertinence"
is entirely forgivable, for it ia written in
a spirit of true appreciation. Dainty bits
of description lend charm, as:
"I wore the flagging smooth in front of
that grim pile where my dear mistress
dwelt, and every night I and one love
lorn owl that flapped above the eaves kept
watch o'er her. Amiens! Mark how that
bird soars !'. Watch it, Amiens! So soared
my soul in those sweet ' days that I am
telling of!"
Thereupon conversation ensues which
excites the lady's curiosity. In the end,
"confesses Jacques, 'I have had my ex
perience.' "

The author has this to say on the sub

Polygamy tends more and more to disappear
in Turkey, not only owing to the spread of
Occidental ideas, but also and more especially
on account of its great cost. The rapid and
constant increase in the expenses of modern
life renders more and more burdensome the
enormous outlay necessitated by the mainte

sensuality the Oriental is drifting rapidly
toward monogamy, with which he will Boon be

NOW comes the most startling book
that has appeared for many a
day. M. Georges Dorys is to the
fore in the literary world with
"The Private Life of the Sultan."
First, a little about who M. Dorys is.
We are told that Dorys after all is but a
pseudonym and that this young man who
has dared to write of the inner life of
"the King of Kings, the shadow of God
upon earth, the sole arbiter of the desti
nies of the world, master of the two con
tinents and the two seas, sovereign of the
Orient and th2 Occident," etc., is none
other than the son of the . late Prince
Samos, one of the Sultan's Ministers and
at one time Governor of Crete.
That M. Dorys has written daringly is
shown by the lack of favor \u25a0with -which
the Sultan regards the publication of the
bock. It is said that he has appealed to
the different governments where the book
has appeared and asked that it be sup
pressed. In Sweden he prevailed upon
the authorities to , prohibit sales of the
\u25a0work and to raid houses for copies. Fur
ther, he condemned to death the author
and probably the sentence would have
been carried cut had not M. Dorys left
hurriedly fcr a foreign country.
It is not a nice story that M. Dorys has
to tell of his Imperial Highness Abdul
Hamid II of Turkey, and the wrath of
the object of these attacks can well be
imagined. The author seems to have been
very close to tho life in the Yildiz Palact
2n fact, he had the opportunity of ac
quiring: information at. first handâ first
through his father and then through his
own position a-; sub-correspondent of the
London Times.
M. Dorys finally became ,too interested
in the "wrong" tide of politics to please
the Sultan, and consequently was obliged
to leave hurrifdly for Paris, where the
present book v.-js written. Undoubtedly
M. Dorys has no love for the Sultan of
Turkey, and possibly many of his state
ments may be regarded by 'readers as in
spired by personal animus. Through the
eyes of the author Abdul Hamid II cer
tainly does not show to advantage.
He pictures him as cunning, crafty;
merciless, a believer in magic and su
perstitious to a degree, and a man who
lives in constant fear of his life. He tells
â¢us that the Sultan has such a dread of
the darkness that he always has the Yil
dlz Park brilliantly lighted; that he is
terrified by silence, and consequently has
an armed force marching up and down
â¢in froni of his window all night: spies re
port to him at al! hours of the night, and
woe betide the man or woman of whom
he becomes suspicious; that even the fire
department nÂ» 7 >st get his permission be
fore attending a lire, and it is even sa'.d
that the official permission is very slow
in coming when the house happens to be
long to one of the suspected.
All of these things and many more M.
Dorys brings oU in his book on the Sul
tan. A large part of the book is anec
dotal, which always imparts interest to a.
work of this character.
There is this to bo -said for the good
faith of M. Dorys â newspaper dispatches
End reports from other sources bear out
the truth of many of his statements; at
any rate his book Is well worth reading.
Those who wish can discredit * the
author's tales of cruelty on the part of
Turkey's niter and still find much in
the work that is both instructive and in
teresting.
That some of the high officials realized
a mistake had been made at the begin
ning of Abdul Hamid's reign would ap
pear from the following:
"It .took ire three months to know AMul
.Aziz: 'hree hours wfre sufficient to Judse Ab
dul Harflirt." said the former Grand Vizier,
>!ehmÂ«5 Ruchdi Pasha, one day to his friend.

KÂ£ir.ah!e and Dret-jmption into, the bargain;
he is lenorar!! of everything and thinks h*
know* It all." And ths Grand Vijter added,
with the air of a man filled with reitret and
s-adres-f. HaJtittik (what a blunder we have
-made)!
Here is a graphic description of Abdul
\u25a0Hamid IIâ the manâ according to* the pen
cf M. Dorys:

j f culty thÂ£t one can now reccjmize In him
' tht Prince Harr-id re^res?r.ted ia the portrait

His jaws have grown broader, eivtns to hla
face a brutality it aid not have before; the
cheek tones, formerly unnoticeable. protrude
rrcrr.inently on hollow cheeks, v.'hich have
been covered for more than twentv vesrs by
a sfcort beard, now quite gray, and which he
himself dyes very clumsily various shades of
brown and brownish rid with a mixture of
coffee and rail-nut, tie recipe for which was
.given him by a sheik.
His forehead bulges out slightly and he con
â¢efeals his baldness under the enormous fez
\u25a0which he has mads fashionable in Turkey,

the ecxadated i.aJenr*s of his face seem even
more eickly.

thin !:smd oiten caresses with a mechanical

elty which completes the character of thin
mouth, to interestins for the physiognomist,
is also deeper and more apparent.
The flattened tenures, with the widely sep
arated orbit*, have become more hollow, and
in the depth* of the eyes, now half hidden
tinder the drooping eyelids and heavy lashes.
*Â»ems to be smoldering the vacillating flame
of his e lance.
The eyes are the most disconcerting part of
t.tus complex physiognomy. Reflecting usually
uneasy melancholy and falseness, at other
times they â¢will stare fcr a long time Into
vacancy as though absorbed in thought, and
then, if a flash of anger or fear lightens up
the dark-gray irig, the color of a stormy sky,
they instantly become remarkably keen and
alort, and, like the eyes of the insane. caut>e
those whose glance they meet a painful im
pression that can be borne only after long
familiarity.
In short, the entire physiognomy of the Sul
tan confirms his divers characteristics, even
that of the hypocritical gentleness that he as
sumes at times.
Of medium height, slightly rickety on his
lÂ»gs and painfully thin, he seems now only to
have his breath left, and in fact, it is hia
nerves that keep him alive. Such a constitu
tion must necessarily Influence his mentality.
Abdul Hamid Is. In truth, a victim of neuras
thenia, and a monomaniac. His physical con
dition alone can explain the contradictions of
his cha.ra.cter.

Not on!j Is the lif* of a man who U trouble

feems to calm 2nd soothe his shattered nerves,
always stretched to the snapping point. "At

chamberlains, "he has some one read to him.
His favorite books are those giving detailed
accounts of assassinations and executions. The
etories of crimes excite him and prevent him
Bleeping, but as soon as his reader reaches a
passage where blood flows, the Sultan im
xnfdiately becomes calm and falls asleep.
The photograph of the Sultan's favorite
riding horse is shown on this page. This
superb animal was a present to him from
the Czar, and formerly the Sultan was
considered a very fair rider. He still takes

the imperial princes taught horseman
ehip at the riding school adjoining the
stables. The reason for the Sultan giving
up the pastime as far as he himself is
concerned Is explained in the following:
. A few year* ago he frequently rode his im
mense park on horseback, accompanied by ona
of his sons, particularly Ahmet-Effendi. the
Prince who rides best: but during one of these
rides -aa accident happened which resulted in
their being stopped. The Sultan, having ex
pressed a wish to visit the porcelain factory.
the place was evacuated in advance by all the
-workmen, according to a rule always followed
on 6uch occasions. One of the workmen, how
ever, hid himself behind a bush, and as the
Sultan approached, started forward suddenly
and held out a petition. The Sultan's horse
ehled at the apparition and almost threw bis
imperial rider, who thought the man's move
ment was an attempt upon his life. He ordered
the arrest of the bold petitioner, and the un
fortunate man was turned over to Hadji
Hassan Pasha, military commander of Bechik
tach fort and secret executioner. He was
never seen or heard of again.
The Sultan fears conspiracies to such an
extent that he has never permitted the
use of the telephone in Constantinople.
For the same reason he has prohibited the
use of carrier pigeons. The electric light
is also tabooed for the people of Con
stantinople and it is the only capital still
lighted by gas alone. The Sultan uses the
light in his palace, but he labors under
the impression that "electric discharges
may result from currents* of high pres

tÂ»er of cables. And any. explosion occur

fies him by its relation â although a purely
etymological oneâ to the word dynamite,
a substance for which he. has the most

Regarding the practice of torturing,
what M. Dorys has to say Is almost in
credible of belief to us of America:
There are some that are novel, as, for in

this sketch the writer recently made a
visit to Aranjuez,- one of Mexico's most
beautiful country places, situated near
Guaymas, in the State of Sonora. Here
the most idealistic phases of life on a rep
resentative hacienda were experienced.
The place had been named after the coun
try seat of, the King near Madrid; and the
fact that, .with all its prseent loveliness,
it was originally redeemed from the des
ert in the midst of which, like a veritable
oasis, it lies, renders its regal title all tho
more appropriate.
Notwithstanding the air of indolence
which to a greater or less extent pervades
the Mexican hacienda, there Is combined
with it a counter atmosphere of luxurious
ease that is deliclously infectious. The
country* dwelling, or casa de campo as it
ia commonly â¢ designated, is -invariably
built on a plan best calculated for the
comfort of its Inmates, its chief charac
teristics being the broad, cool verandas
and graceful arcades surrounding its'ex
terior, the deepset windows and delect
able courtyards. The surrounding planta
tion, - which is usually measured by the
square league, is inclosed by walls of loose
stone or hedges of the maguey plant The
sharp, bayonet-like leaves of the latter
render it quite as Impassable as, and far
more . attractive than, the barbed-wire
fences of the north. The' greater portion
of the rich land, however, serves only for

a world-wide proverb. To such an extent

A Mexican meal is always served in
courses, usually including two kinds of
soup and several varieties of j meat, sel
dom more than one vegetable and never
but one dessert. Bread is placed upon the
table in the loaf and is broken instead of
6liced, while butter is noticeable through
its absence, being used only in the
preparation of the meal. Knives and forks
are rarely employed excepting by the
upper .'classes, the food being conveyed to
the mouth by means of thin bits of corn
cake, known as tortillas. So adroit are
the people in this Quaint custom that it
seldom happens their fingers come in di
rect contact with their victuals.
The Mexican people are devout lovers
of- hcvne life; and hence comparatively

The butcher, in cutting up his meat, never

his wares in paper, but deposits them side

built on the plan of a hollow square, in
the center of which is a spacious court or
patio, densely filled with potted shrubbery

doors are inverted, while the keys thereto
are of enormous size, irequently being a

IT is undeniably a graceful act for the
traveler Just in from a pilgrimage
through Old Mexico to tell of the
progress the country is making in the
adoption of modern usages. It is both
Just and encouraging to our prosperous
Bouthern neighbor. But nevertheless the
features that actually afforded that self
same Individual the most enjoyment were
the Quaint antique customs and condi
tions that to so great an extent still char
acterize the realm. The predominance of
the medieval over the modern is what
impresses and enthuses the stranger in
Mexico. It is the subtle Innate romance
In the land that allures and inspires. And
not the least element Involved in this ten
dency is the fascinating domestic life of
the people.
A curious romance is told in connection
with one of these antiquated dcmicile3. A
young American who had recently taken
up his residence in a ' certain Mexican
town became enamored of one of the fdir
senoriias of the community, and, with an
enteriJtise characteristic of his lineage, at
once undertook the task of acquiring her
affections. Now, to any one familiar with
tho tactics ordinarily employed in ouch
projects elsewhere, this may appear as a
simple proposition. But in Mexico it is
different, a world of intricacy being in
volved in its most commonplace of court
ships. In that unique country a senorita's
tery. The upper story -windows, opening
on the streets, are provided with ornate
iron balconies, while those of the lower
floors are guarded by vertical metallic
bars. Numerous misconceptions have
from time to time arisen concerning the
object of this last mentioned feature. The
common theory that these bars are for
the protection of the property against in
vasion by thieves is entirely erroneous,
R9 the Mexican robber's averseness to the
risks attendant upon house-breakirg is
proverbial. In point of fact, barred win
dow casements did not originate with the
Mexicans', but were introduced w th the
ingress of the Spaniards in Cortez's t'.Tno.
and constitute a relic of the domestic
usages which prevailed in the earliest an
nals of Spain.
The Mexican town residence invariably
occupies the entire ground attached to
the premises, and is accessible by an am
ple arched^ hall and driveway combined.
Thy latter is closed at night by heavy
wooden doers closed from within. If a
stable be attached to *the premi?er, it
forms a portion of the main structure, and
not infrequently adjoins the living apart
ments in front. Hence, from an exterior
view of the establishment there is no ab
solute certainty as to which of its several
departments the shuttered windows open

Ill Begins in Sunday Call, October 13th. |||PROFESSOR E. T. LAUGHTON has
returned to his home in New York
after spending the winter In ex
ploring tho mountains near Buena
Vista. Colo., and investigating the habits
of a species of monster spiders found in
the middle Cottonwood Pass, says the
Washington Star.
Little definite is known of these spiders,
but around them has been gathered a
mass of Indian legend and prospectors'
yarns that rival those of Munchausen.
Many years ago these spiders lived in a
cave easily reached by tourists. It was in
a valley two miles northeast from Har
vard City, then a thriving mining camp
eight miles west of Buena Vista.
In 18S0, a man named Shultz cut his way
into the spiders' den- Ho did not return,
and a week later a searching party found
his body partly burled in the spiders' cave
under a mass of fallen rock. As it' would
have required considerable; timbering at
an expense of several hundred dollars to
recover the body, and as -the manhad no
known relatives, it was left undisturbed.
Shultz's skeleton is still Jn the cave, but
the spiders have found another home fur
ther back In the mountains.
Some of the tales told about these
spiders are given in an old letter which
has just been found in Buena Vista. It
says:
"A short, distance out of Buena 'Vista
there is a cavo swarming with spiders of
immense size, some of them having legs
four-inches in length and bodies as large
as that of a canary bird. The cave was
discovered in 18G8 and was often visited
by pioneers on their, way to California,
who obtained their , webs for use In the
place of thread.
"Early and late the cave resounds with
a buzzing sound emitted by the. spiders as
they weavo their webs. The webs were
tested in 1871 and found to be composed
of silk of the finest quality. The skins
of the spiders make good gloves, as they
are pliable and require no tanning.
"A number were captured arid ' tamed,
and manifested great affection for ,all
members of tho family. They were far
superior to a cat in exterminating rats
and mice, following their prey Into the
holes In the walls and ceilings. One
spider, kept as a pet by a Buena Vista
lady, used to stay all night at the head
of her bed acting as a sentinel." j
The cultivation of coco, says a writer In
the Scientific American, Is at~ present an
inviting agricultural pursuit ln Trinidad
and parts of Venezuela. â¢ The coco tree
cannot withstand strong sunshine, and
the young plants ' have to be shaded by
banana or plaintain trees, and later, when
they attain their by tall trees
known as "immortels," or the "mother of
the coco." These make a kind of canopy
over the entire plantation. The fruit of
the coco tree is. a; pod, resembling a cu
cumber, and growing j on the trunk, or
large branches, where it "looks as though
it were artiflcally attached." The seeds
are like large, thick Lima beans embed
ded In pulp. These form the coco beans
of commerce. The processes of j curing
and drying require much attention.

THE MONSTROUS SPIDERS OF COLORADO.
adorned, yet as these differences occur In
every part of Africa where lions are met
with, and since constant varieties, with
one fixed type of mane, living by them
selves and not interbreeding with other
varieties, do not exist anywhere, modern
zoologists are, I think, now agreed that
there is only one species of lion, since
I
ln any large series of wild lldn skins
made in any particular district of Africa
or Asia every gradation # will be found
between the finest maned specimens and
tiiose which are destitute of any mane at
all. Several local races have, however,
been recently, described by German
\u25a0writers.
In the hot and steaming, coast lands of
tropical Africa Hons usually have short
manes, and never, I believe, attain the
long, silky black manes sometimes met
with on the high plateaux of the interior.
However, 'there is, I believe, no part of
Africa where all or even the majority of
male lions carry heavy manes, the long
Speaking generally, there is little or no
danger in meeting a lion or lions in the
daytime. Even in parts of the country
where firearms are unknown, and where
the natives seldom or never interfere with
them, these animals seem to have an in
stinctive fear of man, and even when en
countered at the carcass of an animal
freshly killed, and at a time when they
may be supposed to be hungry, they will
almost invariably retreat before the un
welcome presence, sometimes slowly and
sulkily, but in districts where much hunt
ing with firearms has been going on at a
â¢very rapid pace.
However, I "have known of two cases of
Europeans mounted on horseback having
been attacked by lions in broad daylight,
arid Dr. Livingstone mentions a third. In
one of the instances which came Within
my own knowledge a lion sprang at a Beer
hunter, as he was riding slowly along,
carrying -an elephant gun in his ' right
hand and followed by a string of natives
on foot. The lion attacked from the left
side and with Its right paw seized my
friend from behind by the right side of
his face and neck, inflicting deep gashes
with its sharp claws, one of which cut
right through hia cheek and tore out one
of his teeth. My "friend was pulled from
his horse, but clutching the loosely girthed
saddle tightly with his knee, it was twist
ed round under the horse's . belly before
he fell to the ground. Instead of follow
ing up its success .the lion, probably
scared by the shouting of * the Kaffirs,
trotted away for a short distance, and
then turned and stood looking at the dis
mounted hunter, who, never having lost
his presence of mind. 'immediately shot it
dead with hia heavy old muzzle loading
elephant gun."
Little Danger in Daytime.
Lions with very full black manes, cov
ering the whole shoulders, are rare any
where, but more likely to be encountered
on the high plateaux, where the winter
nights are extremely cold, than anywhere
else. In sUch cases, in addition to the
tufts of hair always found on the elbows
and in the ai'tnpits of lions with fair-sized
manes, there will be large tufts of hair
in each flank, just where the thighs join^
the belly. But I have'never yet seen the
6kin of a lion shot -within the last-thirty
years with the whole belly_ covered with
long, thick, hair, as may constantly
be observed in lions kept in captivity in
the menageries of Europe.
There is, however, some evidence to
show that when lions existed on the
high plains of the Cape Colony and tho
Orange River Colony, where the winter
nights are much. colder than in the coun
tries farther north where lions may' still
be encountered, certain individuals of the
species developed a growth of long hair
all over the belly, as well a3 an extraor
dinary luxuriance of mane on the. neck
and shoulders.
From the foregoing remarks It will be
seen that wild animals, having as a rule
much less luxuriant manes than many ex
amples of their kind to be seen in Euro
pean menageries, are ordinarily not so
majestic and dignified in appearance as
many of their caged relatives. On the
other hand, the wild lion is a much more
alert and active dhimal than a menagerie
specimen, and when in good condition is
far better built and more powerful look
ing, being free from all appearance of
Iankines3 and weakness in the legs, and
having strong, well formed hind quartern.
\u25a0 The eyes of the menagerie lion, too, look
brown and usually sleepy,- while those of
the wild animal are yellow and extra
ordinarily . luminous, even after death.
When wounded and standing at bay. with
head held low between his shoulders,
growling hoarsely and with twitching tail,
even if he is not near enough to be ob
perved very closely, a lion looks a very
favage and dangerous animal; but should
he be wounded in such a way as to admit
of a ' near approachâ perhaps by a shot
that has paralyzed his hind quarters â his
flaming eyes will soem to throw out sparks
of living fire.
hair of r which does not. as a rule, cover
more than the neck and chest, with a tag
of varying length and thickness extending
from the back of the neck to between tho
' shoulder-blades.
Besides these tnree instances of Euro
peans having been attacked in the day
time by lions I have known of a certain
number of natives having been killed in
broad daylight. Such incidents are, how
ever, by no means every-day occurrences,
and, speaking generally, it may be said
that .the risk of molestation by lions in
Africa during the daylight is very small.
It is by night that lions roam abroad with
stealthy step in search of prey a;nd at
such times they are often, when hungry,
incredibly bold and daring. I have known
them upon several occasions to enter a
hunter's camp, and, regardless of fires, to
seize oxen and horses and human beings.
'\u25a0' During' the year following the first oc
cupation of Mashonaland, in 1890, a great
deal. of damage was done by lions, which
could not resist the attractions of the
settlers' livestock. For the first few
months I kept as accurate account as I
could of the number of horses, donkeys,
oxen, goats and *pigs which were killed
by lions, and it soon mounted up to over
200 head. During the same time several
white men were also mauled by lions, and
one unfortunate man named Teale was
dragged from beneath the cart where he
was sleeping by the side of a native*
driver and at once killed and eaten.
Several of the horses were killed insids
rough shelters serving as stables.
In the following year (1891) over 100 pigs
were killed in one night by a single
lioness. These pigs were In a series of
pens, separated one from another, but all
under one low thatched roof. The Uones3
forced her way in between two poles and
apparently wa3 unable, after having
satisfied her hunger, to find her way out
again, and, becoming angry and fright
ened, wandered backward and forward
through the pen?, killing almost all tho
pigs, each one with a bite at the back of
tin head or neck. Thi3 lionesa, which
had only eaten portions of two young
pigs, made her escape before daylight,
but was killed with a set gun the next
night by the owner of the pig3.
Old Lions Like- Human Diet.
"When lions grow old they are always
liable to become man-eaters. Finding their
strength failing them and being no longer
able to hunt and pull down large ante
lopes or zebras, they are driven by hun
ger to killing small animals, such as
porcupines and even tortoises; or they
may vi3it a native village and catch a
goat or kill a child or woman going for
water; and. finding a human beins a very
easy animal to catch and kill, an old
lion which has once tasted human flesh
wili, in all probability, continue to be a
man-eater until he is killed.
On this subject, in his "Missionary
Travels," Dr. Livingston says: "A man
eater is invariably an old lion, and when
he overcomes his fear of man so far as
to come to the village for goats the peo
ple remark, 'His toeth are worn; he will
soon kill men.* They at once acknowl
edge tha necessity of instant action and
turn out to kill him." It is the prompt
ness with which measures are taken by
the greater part of the natives of South
ern Africa to put an end to any lion
which may take to eating men that pre
vents these animals, as a rule, from be
coming ,the formidable pests which rcan
eating tigers appear to be ln parts of
India. -

THERE is now ln course of publica

works ever undertaken in natural
history. It differs from standard
publications of the kind in the fact
that its primary interest depends upon
its illustrations, which are reproductions
of photographs of wild animals made in
their native haunts.
Hitherto works on natural history, no
trailer how elaborate or costly, have in
the main been illustrated by "fake" pic
tures _that is. illustrations of birds and
animals made, not in the forest or jungle,
tut in the private laboratory of the natur
alist. In even the best-known natural his
tory books the creatures there depicted
are as stiff and artificial as the stuffed
specimens to be seen in museums. Now,
however, the camera has at last invaded
the jungle and forests, whoso inhabitants

Since lions were once to b* found over
the greater portion of the vast continent
of Africa it is self evident that these
animals arÂ« able to accommodate them
selves to great variations of climate and
surroundings, and I myself have met
with them close to the sea, in the hot and
sultry coast Lands of sou! heast Africa, on
the high plateau of Mashonaland, where
at an oltilude of 6000 feet above sea level
the winter nights are cold and frosty:
ar.iong the stony hills to the cast of the
Victoria Falls of the Zambesi, and Ln the
swamps of the Chobi.
The indefinite increase of Hons must
have been checked by some unknown law
of game upon which they depended for
food.
It is easy to understand that the in
crease of a herd of herbivorous animals
would be regulated by the amount of tho
food supply available, as well as constant
ly checked by the attacks of the largo
carnivora, such as lions, leopards, chee
tahs, hyenas and wild dogs; but I have
never been able to comprehend what has
kept within bounds the Inordinate in-,
crease of lions and other carnivorous an!
mals in countries where for ages past
they have had an abundant food supply,
&nd at the same time, having been almost
entirely unmolested by human beings,
have had no enemies. Perhaps such a
state of things doe3 not exist at the pres
ent day, but there are many parts or
Africa where such conditions have existed
from time immemorial up to within qulta
recent years.
To-day lions are still to be found wher
ever game exists in any quantity, and
their numbers wlil be in proportion to
those of the wild aniroals on which they
prey.
But such a state of things has never
been known to occur; and whenever Euro
peans have entered a previously unex
plored and uninhabited tract of country
in Africa, and have found it teeming with
buffaloes, zebras and antelopes, they have
always found lions in such districts very
plentiful indeed, but never in such num
bers as to seriously diminish the abun
dance of the once uninhabited plains. This
practice brought them into conflict with
the white colonists or native herdsmen,
armed with weapons of precision, before
whom they rapidly succumbed.
Increase of Lions.
As the game vanished the lions d{sap
peared, too; for, although at first they
preyed to a large extent on the domestic
flocks and herds which gradually replaced
the wild denizens of nature, otherwise
they would have become so numerous in
the sparsely inhabited or altogether unin
habited parts of Africa that they would
first have exterminated all the game on
which they had been wont to prey and
would then have had to starve or to have
eaten one another.
At that date there can be little doubt
that, excepting in the waterless deserts
and the dense equatorial forests, lions
roamed over the \u25a0whole of the vast conti
nent of Africa, from Cape Agulhas to the
very shore of the Mediterranean Sea; nor
was their range very seriously curtailed
until the spread of European settlements
in North and South Africa and the ac
quisition of firearms by the aboriginal
inhabitants of many parts of the country,
during the latter half of the nineteenth
century, steadily denuded large areas of
all wild game.
since a qunint entry in the diary of Van
Riebeck, the first Dutch Governor of the
Cape, runs thus: "This n'ght the lions
roared as if they would take the fort by
storm" â the said fort being situated on
the site of the city now known as Capo

secretary in publishing an appendix to his
annual report, which is addressed to that
large body of the public which has a gen
eral interest in scientific matters without
special knowledge, of them.
It is of this popular volume that we
here speak.
As the volume for 1900 marks the close
of the century considerable space is given
to re-views of the progress in various
branches of science during the nineteenth
century, prepared by men distinguished
in their various fields. The subjects thus
reviewed are astronomy, chemistry, geol
ogy, physics, electricity, geography, biol
ogy, medicine, physical research, which,
with an article on the "Century's Great
Men of Science," furnish in brief a picture
of scientific activity of the past century.

with extra auxiliary engines, so that tha
main engine can be disconnected If neces

auxiliary engine. This was meant to gtva
economy of fuei when the ship was to go
under ordinary conditions, and reduces
the number of the mechanical staff. The
ship has a rolling chamber to keep her
steady, and a lifting crowsnest, which
affords . facilities for directing her
through the Ice.
Her maiden voyage was from Newcastle
to St. Petersburg. We entered the ice at
the meridian of Revel and had to forca
our way through 160 miles of Ice. It nev
er occurred to any one that the ship
would go to Cronstadt in winter time, and
our entering Cronstadt harbor caused
quite a sensation.
At times the pressure of the ice was so
great and the ice so heavy that it tools
four hours to, make two miles.
One of the best popular articles In this
Report 13 a paper on "Nature's Pictures,"
by A. Radclyffe Dugmore, printed first in,
"The World's Work" by Doubleday, Page
& Co. The study of birds and animals by
the camera, personal contact and through
the hand of kindness denotes a great
stride in the rl;ht direction. One of these
remarkable photographs is produced here
with. It shows a white-footed mouse and
young (about life size). While out for a
walk with a friend the author came across
this interesting group. The frightened
mother instantly disappeared and could
not be found after the most careful
search. Only after reaching home did Mr.
Dugmore's companion find the poor little
creatureâ In his pocket! Fearing lest the
young ones would die the author ran
back two miles with the old mouse in his
hand and managed just before dusk to
secure this picture of the first meeting of
the reunited family.
Among the thirty or more ar

may be mentioned, as Illustrating

vancement in the true sense of the word,
for the Smithsonian Institution is not one
to attach its name to a book of dreams or
fallacies. Many of the articles that go to
make up the contents of the work have
been printed before, but appearing now
as they do in this report it places them on
the high plane of scientific approval.
Astronomy has made wonderful ad
vances during the last century. Its prog
gress appeals more to those trained in
science, but even the lay mind can under
stand and value the great improvements
in astronomical machinery. The differ
ence is striking by contrast, if you notice
the picture of the Chinese astronomical
instruments taken at the loot of Pekingâ a
general view of which is given on this
page.
The apparently impossible problem of
aerial navigation seems to be getting
along famously, for even conservative
Smithsonians are enthusiastic and devote
considerable space in their report to the
two types which have been demonstrated
fair successes.
The Langley aerodrome and the Zeppe
lin airship both come tn for their share
of description and approval. Of the two,
the aerodrome really proves the more in
teresting (shown in cut or. this page), for
it depends entirely on flight for buoyancy ,
and not upon gas bags or balloons. Its
Inventor tries as closely as possible to im
itate the flight of the birds of the air.
Here is a description of the aerodrome
taken from sections of the Smithsonian
report, which will serve to give an idea of
Mr. Langley's success.
The Langley Aerodrome.
What is popularly kno'wn. as the "fly
ing machine" is literally a machine with
out gas to support it. in no way resemb
ling a balloon, and which its inventor has
called the aerodromeâ "air runner." A
â¢model similar to the one shown on this
page has repeatedly flown distances of
over half a mile at a speed of from twen-.
ty to thirty miles per hour. It Is driven
by a steam engine of over one and a quar
ter horsepower. _ ' j/ ; .I
An eye witness, Alexander Graham Bell,
at one of these flights thus describes the
appearance and action of the machine:
The absolute weight of the aerodrome,
including that of the engine and all ap
purtenances, was, I was told, about twen
ty-five pounds, and the distance from tip
to tip of the supporting surfaces was, as
I observed, about twelve or fourteen, feet.
The method of propulsion wafe by aerial
screw propellers, and there was no gas
or other aid for lifting it in the air except
its own .internal energy.
On the occasion referred to the aero
drome at a given signal started from a
platform about 20 feet above the water
â¢md rose at first directly in the face of the
â¢wind, moving at all times with remark
able steitdineafc. ai.u tjUUdetlUci^tiy swing
ing around in large curves of perhaps a
hundred yards in diameter and continu
ally ascending until its steam, was ex
hausted, when, at a lapse of about a min
ute and a half and at a height which I
judged to be between So and 100 feet in
the air, the wheels ceased turning, and
the machine, deprived of the aid of its
propellers, to my surprise did not fall,
but settled down so gently and softly that
it touched the water without the least
shock and was, in fact, ready for another
In the second trial, which followed di
rectly, it repeated in nearly every respect
the actions of the first, except that the
direction of its courae was different, it
ascended again in the face of the wind,
afterward moving steadily and continu
ally In large curves, accompanied with a
rising motion and a lateral advance. Its
motion was, in fact, so steady that I think
a glass of water on Its surface would have
remained unspilled. When the steam gave
out again It repeated for" a second vlmu
the experience of the first trial when the
steam had ceased and settled gently and
easily down. What height It reached at
this trial I cannot say. as I was not so
favorably placed as in the first, but I. had
occasion to notice that this time its course
took it over a wooded promontory, and I
was relieved of some apprehension in see
ing that it was already so -high as to pass
''the tieetops by 20 or 30 feet. It reached
the water one minute and thirty-one sec
onds from the time it started at a meas
ured distance of nine hundred feet from
the point it rose.
This, however, was by no means the
length of its flight. I estimated from the
diameter of the curve described, from the
number of turns of the propellers, as
given by the automatic counter, after due
allowance for. slip, and from other meas
ures, that the actual length of flight on
each occasion was slightly over 3000 feet.
It is at least safe to say that each ex
ceeded half an English mile.
From the time and distance it will be
noticed that the velocity \u25a0was between 20
and 25 miles an hour in a course ' which
was constantly taking it "uphill." I may
add that on a previous' occasion I have
seen a far higher velocity attained 1sy the
same aerodrome when Its- course was
horizontal.
I have no desire to enter into detail fur
ther than I have done, but I cannot but
add that it seems to me that no one who
was present on this interesting- occasion
could have failed to recognize that the
practicability of mechanical , flight had
been demonstrated.
Better known, but of no greater impor
tance in the field of aeronautics, are the
efforts of Count Zeppelin with his airship
on Lake Constance, in Switzerland. The
photograph of the floating shed, wherein
his balloon was contructed, is here repro
duced from the Smithsonian Report. It
measured 450 feet in lensth, 7S broud and
Palace at Peking In I860. This latter is an
abridged translation from a journal writ
ten *.by Count d'Herisson, who was on
the staff of the French general during the
Anglo-French expedition to China in 1860
and an eye witness of the extraordinary
scenes he describes. It appears to have
entirely escaped attention during the late
crisis, although it haa an Interesting bear-
Ing on recent events and illustrates in a
curious manner how history repeats itself
The restoration of extinct animals is an
other matter that has been taken up as a
science and with success by this genera
tion. "While such restorations are subject
to some uncertainties, and mistakes of In
terpretation are apt to occur, these effort
to reproduce the living forms of past aeea
are not mere guesswork, but rest unon a.
solid foundation of scientific facts and
careful deductions. An odd photograph of
the Waterhouse Hawkins workroom at
the Crystal Palace in London is shown on
this page, and will serve to give an idea
drag of the running weight. For this rea
son also, in order to avoid being driven
on over the land, it was necessary to go
astern with the screws whenever â¢ the
stern pointed over the lake."
It seems from all accounts that he float
ing capacity and the great lateral stabil
ity of the Zeppelin air ship have been con
clusively proved. The ship floated smooth
ly in a horizontal position. It also obeyed
Its rudder up to the moment when the
steering cable broke. Moreover, as Count
Zeppelin himselt_says, "It has proved that
there is no danger of fire in connection
with the use of the. air ship in ordinary
conditions. * â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
It is unfortunate that no exact estimate
of speed was obtainable, owing to the ac
cident. Bethge estimates that the fapid
ity of flight before the wind toward.Im
menstaad was about twenty-nine' feet per
second. It Is enough, however, to say
that a dirigible balloon which can main
tain a state of equilibrium aod 'descend
with perfect safety to Its passengers, has
become an established fact.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
\u25a0Weather Kites.
Another srreat stride In the world of
science has been In the use of the kite
for meteorological observation. A. Law
rence Rotch has a valuable paper on this
subject in the Reportâ one which haa been
reprinted with the author's revision from
the Technology Quarterly and Proceed
ings of the -Society* of Arts, Boston, June,
1900.
Just as ' the weather ' bureaus of the
United States have been of service to the
farmers of the country, so has the kite
served the weather bureau in its investi
gations. "Whenever there is a wind kites
possess advantage over any, other method
of exploring the air up to the height of
at least 15,000 feet. The rapid perfecting
of the kite for experimental purposes is
Indicated in the .evolution of the kite reel
66 high, and Is considered the most per-,
feet of Us kind ever devised. As it costs
Â£500 for every filling of the great balloon,
it is likely that the Count will have hia
airship practice pretty much to himself.
To give all of the Interesting details of
construction, etc.. as contained In the ReÂ«
port, would require more space than can
be afforded In a general article. That part
of the account relative to the trial trip
is as follows:
The Zeppelin Air Ship
The best account vof the short and ex
citing trip of the Zeppelin balloon has
been given by Oaptain-l.ieutenant D. von
Bethge, steamship inspector of Friednoh

"when the command to let go the cabi'.'3
sounded from the raft, und the air ship,
which up till then had ijeeri held by'lhe
hands of the. firemen, ,aborers and sol
diers, rcse slowly into the air, and sud
denly at the height of eighty-two fÂ«.et
was released and soared upward. At lirst
the vessel descended somewhat before the
light easterly breeze 1 which was blowing-;
but when the engines uugan to work, it
steamed against the wind, then turne 1 to
the right and left, and afterward traveled
With the wind, turning occasionally hither
and thither until it reached lmmenstaart."
The distance traveled was about three
and a quarter miles.
. In the early part of the trip ah acci
dent to the steering mechanism occurred.
A winch broke and hindered the further
use of the running weight, ' -which was
provided in order that the bow or stern
might be raised, and the horizontal posi
tion regained. Notwithstanding the acci
dent. Lieutenant Bethge goes on to say,
"It was still possible to .turn the balloon
to the left against the wind, but as it was
impossible, owing to the broken cable, to
turn to the right. Count Zeppelin decided
to descend." The descent took placa
seventeen minutes after thfe ascent.
Count Zeppelin has written an account
of the trial trip which fs of special inter
est, as .it comes from one with a full
knowledge of all the details." "The task,"
he says, "of bringing down the air ship
took place without a hitch. In spite of a
rapid and considerable escape of gas, fol
lowed by but a small -sacrifice of ballast,
the descent took place so gently that a
descent on hard ground would seem de
void of danger." "' j
The accident to the running weight
made it necessary to avert the imminent
danger of capsizing by stopping and going
astern with the screws. "Henceforth,"
he adds, "the whole voyage consisted. of
alternately going ahead and then astern,
with the screws, so as to present exces
sive inclination. A further reason for this
alternate motion arose from the circum
stance that the "air Bhip, which at first
obeyed her helm. well to. starboard, ran
more and more to the left, owing, appar

wheelbarrow of 1S94-5 to the steam engine
of 1S97. Some idea of this progress can be
derived from the following:
"Since the use of wire and more em
dent kites the heights have been greatly
inci eased. Thus the average height above
the sea attained by the meteorograah in
the thirty-five flights made during 1893
was more than a mile and a third, where
as the average height of all the ascents
prior to 1SS7 was less than halt a mile.
The extreme height of 15,807 feet, reached
in July, 1900, exceeds the altitude of
Mount Blanc, and also the greatest
height at which meteorological observa
tions have been made with a balloon in
the United States."

The running of the last Futurity at Un

a new factor, as the work of the young

footing with the more matured champions

The puppies whelped in 1900 which have

successful courser, and the youngsters
will , not be without good backing when
they are slipped even with the more ex

for many of the puppies that their next

in the stake the successful greyhound

feeling. Palo Alto, Slsquoc, Qewdrop,

There will probably be a handicap
doubles tournament for the Davis cups at.
the California Club courts to-day. These
cups have been won twice by thÂ© Whit-
ney brothers, Collier and Crowell and
Smith and Cornell. They must be won
five times to become the permanent prop-*
erty of any team. Many other teama
have their names on tho cups once.
The three new oil-packed courts In
Golden Gate Park have been completed
and have already proved much better
than the ones laid out previously. What
they lack most is rolling. When they are
as hard as the main drive, which 13
packed with oil, they will be as true as
asphalt courts, and better in some re
spects.'
Those in charge of the park courts have
acted favorably upon the suggestion of
putting shower baths and lockers In thÂ©
old band stand, and in a short time the
players will have every convenience at
their disposal.
It would.be a good plan to build onÂ©
asphalt court in the park and have It as
an exhibition court. If this were done the
best players in the city would bÂ£ willing
to play exhibition matches in the park.
This would add to the interest of both
players and spectators.
The building of these courts was mere
ly an experiment, the unexpected success
of which makes it safe to say that in a
year from now there will be at least
twenty-five public tennis courts In tho.
park. /
Several of the local cracks are trying
to learn the peculiar service used by Bell,
the Southern California champion. Thia
service, is made at the top of the reach
and with the racket parallel to the
ground. The racket is drawn from left to
right. This gives the ball a peculiar cut
and causes it to bound exceedingly; high
and toward instead of away from the re
ceiver. This service was brought to the
coast two years ago by the Eastern cham
pions. Smith and Collier are using It with
the most success at present.
Many changes will be made by the pres
ent board. The tournament committee
will make out a schedule of tournaments
for the coming year, so the players will
know exactly on what day3 the events
will be held. As the membership limitâ
200â has almost bee*n reached there is talk
of raising the initiation fee, but it la
doubtful if this will te done, as the ma
jority of the members are not In favor
of it.
principal topic of discussion
ff * among tennis enthusiasts Is the
f^J recent election of directors held
at tho California Tennis Club.
The board is made up of practi
cally the same men as last year, the two
retiring members being George Whitney
and R. J. Davis. The- latter has been
treasurer of the club since It started,
eleven years aso, and its present success
is largely due to his efforts. At first
glance it might appear the members are
ungrateful in not electing Mr. Davis, but
the fact that he has not played tenni3
for a year and consequently is unknown
to the new members justifies them in
their course.

Competition among the men will be
stimulated by the handsome challenge

the competitions being over thirty-six

richs, a most honorable sportsman. He
asks the members of the Fish and Game
Commission the following question: ''Can
the steward of a pun c\ub have under his
charge lnÂ»the stoieroom jit the shooting
box ducks exceeding fifty In number,. the
property of different members and the
result of their individual shooting?",
Interpreting the law as It stands, the
Commission officers have replied that the
steward of a club is liable to arrest if the
birds are kept in one room. Qualifying
this they add if the birds were in the
individual lockers of the members the
law would not be considered violated.
Manager Babcock of Hotel Coronado Is
also in a quandary. He has a shooting
lodge in* the country some distance from
his hotel. It has been his custom for
years to extend an invitation to the
sportsmen among his friends to spend a
few days with him in quest of ducks. As
they usually kill more than they can dis
pose of, they have had them placed In
cold storage at the hotel to be distributed
later among their friends by the steward.

To comÂ© down to the present year, the
success of American oaremen at Henley
regatta has brought out the suggestion
that hereafter all foreign entries be- re
fused. It Is claimed thesÂ© regattas origin
ally meant a week of pleasuring on the
river. The competitions were of a friendly
character and the men trained In a
desultory sort of way 'for them. When
the American crews and single scullers
went over all was changed. They settled
down to strict business such as they had
been accustomed to from the. first tlmÂ©
they sat on a sliding seat in a practice
boat and, perforce. Englishmen had to
follow their strenuous methods. It is -to
do away with this and to return to the
dilettante attitude which prevailed before
the American Invasion that Englishmen
are making.

Cyclists' Union championships, the blue

was followed by W. C. ganger, who re

muttering* of discontent at the time over
foreigners winding these classic events.
The cup of bitterness overflowed the fol

Fires Caused by Nails
Luncheon over, we were all curiosity to
see the net pulled in. For this process the
boats slow up, the men take their places
in the stern, and the ropes are taken up
until the "brails," or wooden portion of
the net, Is sighted, then a few turns
around the 'gypseys of the winch are
taken, both ropes are then put In charge
of the tug furnished with block and tackle
on the boom of the main mast. By this
the net is drawn up like a bag, then
As it neared the noon hour everybody
found a comfortable seat and waited for
"breakfast"; did not wait very patiently
either, for the salty air gives one a royal
appetite. Great round loaves of bread
were brought out a'nd sliced in no dainty
proportions. Vpon piwrs about an inch
thick were placed good sized of
beefsteak. Another inch slice of bread
was added to this. Then the novel sand
wiches, with an onion to each, were pass
ed around. After thisâ as we were "com
pany"âan especial entree of fish prepared
fisherman's style was served.
Now whoever goes out In a fishboat, if
they have the good fortune not to be sick,
should Insist upon having a dish of
"Chesplni." This is the way to make it.
My authority is a scrap of soiled paper
written In Italian. Translated, It says:
"Put Into kettle half glass of sweet oil,
one clove of garlic, two large tomatoes,
two chili peppers, one glass of white
wine; prepare fresh fish, cut in small
squares, drop Into the sauce and cook
three minutes; serve hot/' It really tastes
much better than it sounds.
bag sideways in the water, and of course
miss all the fish. It takes two tugs for a
drag. These move along s:de by s'de. the
wheels of each revolving just so many
times to the minute in order' to keep the
drag straight. In the stern of each boat
stands a man holding one end of tha
great net, which is about seventy feet
long. One side of this is weighted so that
when the tw<r ends are simultaneously
cast out the net, which is a three-inch
mesh, in order to let a!l the small fish
slip through, stretches cut like a screen
between the two boats; then the men at
the stern pay out the rope until the
weighted side is in about forty famoms
of water.
All this time the boats are in motion
and the net is dragged for an hour or
more. It takes four men and one "boss"
to each boat, not counting the captain,
fireman, etc.
SPEAKING of insurance matters,"
said a listener,- "I suppose, the
plain, old-fashioned nail has caused
more fires in the big establishments
where machinery is used in many and
complicated ways than any other . littls
thing In existence. The cigarette stub ha3
played Its part. Ditto, the cigar stump.
Occasionally sparks have fallen from the
ditcher's pipe into a. wad of material eas
ily ignited, and a fire has been the result.
Sparks have oozed out from smokestacks"
and engines of various .' kinds with the"
same results. .And there is the match, tha
deadly and dreaded match, the awful en
emy of the men who are engaged in the
business of betting, if I may say, it.
One of the most popular characters of
this little world all by itself is the Col
lector'of wharfage rent, Luther G. Norria..
Saturday is the fishermen's Sunday. No
beats go out on" that day, the fish for
Monday being caught on our day of rest,
but the men and boys congregate on the
wharf just the same, and a wholesale
mending of nets takes place. Sitting
tailor, fashion, the operator weaves the
shuttle back and forth patching up a great
hole In no time; and this, too, Is the social
gathering of the week, and here the real
"fl&h" stories, tales of sea serpents and
mermaids, adventures with whales, etc.,
aro exchanged, and to the outsider this
Italian wit and imagination is a revela
tion. What capital dime novel writers
some of these dwellers of the wharf would'
make If given an opportunity.
Back of the long building which Is used
as a market when an over supply of fish
comes in, is a dyeing or tanning depart
ment. Here nets and sails are soaked in
a strong solution of tan. This colors them
a pretty shade of coffee brown* and at the
same time adda to their durability, for
nets and sails so treated withstand the
wear and tear, giving several years', ser
vice over the untanned ones.
These baskets when full are let down
still lower, swished around in the water
to wash off the contents, then hauled up
and the fish are packed standing as it
were, heads all up, into boxes which are
rapidly loaded into wagons.
The same scene is being repeated from
different parts of the long wharf, and at
each new arrival the interests of the
onlookers swerve, for every one is curious
to see the hatches opened and get a
glimpse of the catch. Groups of China
men jabber, examine the fish as though
they were purchasing diamonds, then
when the Italian dealer begins to say
picturesque things in his native tongue,
which somehow the. heathen seem to
comprehend, they fill up their baskets
quickly, hand over the money and shufHa
over to the crabbers to repeat the jabber
ing and haggling.
An interesting portion of Fisherman's
wharf, which, by the way, has been,
moved to the foot of Stockton street, is
the net department. All the length of the
companion wharf f^he nets are hung out
to dry. The great bundle of white corka,
the ficaters, lie bleaching In the sun and
are admittedly a great temptation to the

studio decorations.

port the various kinds and pack them in
separate compartments in the hold. . .A.
moderate catch is about fifty boxes,
seventy pounds to the box. comprising all
kindsâ flounder, tomcod, sefibass. codfish,
and occasionally small sharks. Crabs, too,
are taken up in the dragnets, sometimes
an octopus, ind not infrequently the nets
are torn into shreds by some 'deep sea.
monster becoming entangled". As a rule,
two or tjiree drags are sufficient to fill tlia
demand, but on Thursday the boats re
main out longer, in order to provide
material for Friday's increased, sale.
From 4 to 5 o'clock in the afternoon from
Fisherman's wharf the launches, skiffs
and tugs can be seen coming in, looking
like a flock of brown birds as they near
the harbor. From the deck of- our boat,
as we steamed into the still water, wo
could see the little army of helpers rusli
ing about, getting ready to unloadâ and

baskets balanced on a pole over tha

The water Is never quite calm out here
and many a time a wave slips smoothly

not. Perhaps they exert the mental

they do the scheme works beautifully, for

-RO^D RUNNSR, XTNS SNAKE - AND RATTUER.
5:\ a country where a quarter of a cen
tury eco a rattlesnake was to be
found under every rock and In every
hillock, the reptile ia rapidly becom
es a rarity, says the New York Sun.
With his human relative, the Apache, the
rattler is disappearing from Arizona, and
Is now found only In the most isolated
districts.
To the advance of civilization und the
unremitting warfare of the road runner
and the king eoake may be attributed
the extermination of the rattler. Wher
ever irrigation has fountii its way the rat
tlesnake has been driven to higher ground,
and there the prospector and miner have
el-iin him whenever and wherever found.
The roaa runner, that long-legged feath
ered warrior, has done his part, and done
it well.
aiuch resembling, but more lightly con-
structed than the fighting cock, the road
runner is one of the most dreaded enemies
of the rattler. In fact, so great are his
snake killing propensities that heavy pen
alties are provided by the Territorial sta
tutes as a protection to him from the gun
of the hunter. Apparently Immune to the
venom in the poison sac of the rattler, the
road runner attacks the largest snake
with impunity, and has never been known
to loee a fight. Frequently, indeed, the
road runner has been known to battle
with and kill a pair of large diamond rat
tlers whose total weight was five times
that cf his own.
Not so common an enemy to the rattle
snake, â¢ but no less deadly. Is the king
snake, a species of the bull snake family.
Rarely seen in the lower countries, but
often found in the northern forests and
higher mountains, the king snake wages
constant warfare on the rattler, and when
his great lithe form coils around the body
of the rattlesnake the life of the latter is
a matter of only a few seconds. >
Herbert Housland, a prospector, had an
experience with a rattler, a king snake
and a road runner a few days ago which
he will not soon forget. He was with a
party in the Bradshaw Mountains, south
of Prescott, and was guarding camp for
the day. He had lain down to sleep when
he was suddenly aroused to find a great
rattlesnake coiled upon his breast.
"I almost suffocated from fearing to
breathe lest I should be bitten,',' -he said.
"The snake was greatly excited, and in
a minute I saw the cause. A king snake
was trying to excite the rattler to com
bat, and my person was the chosen battle
ground. The king snake had probably
forced the rattler to refuge upon my body,
and following up his aggressive tactics
was running in a circle around the rattler
very rapidly. He crossed my breast from
left to right and my thighs from right to
left, and within less than a foot of the
rattler's body.
"The velocity of the snake was most
wonderful.* It seemed to be one continu
ous ring, and part of the time I could
seemingly see three or four rings at once.
I made a slight movement with my right
foot, which attracted the rattler's atten
tion for an Instant, and that was fatal to
him. At that. one false movement of his
eyes the king snake darted and seized the
rattler by the throat, close up to his head,
and began instantly to coll around his
victim. "" .
"They, rolled oft me in their death
struggle and became one tangled mass for
ten minutes, when the rattler's sounds
died away gradually. While IT lay ex
hausted from my irlght a road runner
durted out. of a bush and grabbing the
two . snakes * in . his beak began -to drag
them away. The weight was too great,
but he killed the king snake by a blow
from his long bill, and ran ' away as I
arose and threw the two reptiles into the
bushes, and there the bird and his mate
devoured them."
MUSTCAU SSNtTStRV TS LATEST PARIAN FAD-
mUSICAL dentistry is the latest
discovery in Paris. It has been
taken up by a well known phy
sician, who expounded it before
the Paris Academy of Medicine, and it
has thus received the sanction of high
scientific authority. The method consists
in drawing teeth to the sounds of sweet
music. A usually trying operation be
comes, it is stated, not only painless, but
quite pleasant, when conducted in tMs
way. The physician addressed the
academy meeting- on 'behalf of a Pans
dentist, \u25a0 who has already applied the
musical method with- success. The idea
of the new proqess was first suggested by
observation of patients under the.influ
ence of anaesthetics, the drug used being
nitrogen protoxide in , vapors. As Is
known, the incipient effect of the latter is
to' produce In nearly every case disagree
able, sometimes almost unbearable, sensa
tions, resembling those experienced '{ in
nightmare. The dentist' in question came
to the conclusion that this preliminary
ordeal of bad dreams at the commence
ment of the anaesthetic influence was
caused by the perception of noised around
by the mind when in a State of still
partial consciousness. Why not soothe
patients into the required condition of
temporary oblivion by sweeter 3ounds?
The dentist tried the experiment, and he
and his patients were alike charmed witn
the result. The latter were as good as
gold; the tooth-pulling operations, not
being Interfered with by the groans or
contortions of 'sufferers, were performed
with. the greatest ease, and on recovering
consciousness all . that pai.ents remem
bered were bars of. the "Lohengrin" over
ture, for example, still softly singing in
their ears.* ;The ; nÂ«w method having been
Invented, nothing remained but to bring
it to its greatest' possible pitch of per
fection. The obvious difficulties in the
way of dentists habitually- keeping bands,
solo singers and choirs en the premises
were avoided by means of- powerful
phonographs. Now the operator whose
new method has been revealed to the
Academy of Medicine regularly uses a
machine of this kind. The patient puts
the tubes to his ears, the music is started,
the gas administered, and shortly after
ward the occupant of the once dreaded
dental chair awakens . from pleasant
dreams to see the smiling surgeon show
ing him hi3 tooth. Of course a varied
choice of musical selections canâ and.
indeed, should â be made to suit different
temperaments and teeth. Without going
into these particular questions the phy
sician spoke quite enthusiastically about
the new process to the assembled
academicians. He Is eager to apply tho
musical method to surgical operations in
general. He intends making experiments
of his own in this direction, and he hop-*d
that some of his hearers would <to llks

is tolerated by his mate, who is always

she seeks another partner without delay.
The nesting begins when the pigeons
are about six months old. It takes eight
een days for the two eggs that are laid
at a setting to hatch. The male bird di

giving her an hour or two to fly around,

ONE of the most remarkable meteors
recorded in history is known 'as
the New Jersey meteor of Novem
ber 15, 1859. At S:CU o'clock in the
morning the rnetecr appeared in the
heavens over the southern part of New
Jersey. It was so brilliant that, although
the sun v. r as unclouded and had an eleva
tion of 20 degrees above the horizon, the
flash attracted attention as fur north as
Albany and Boston and as far south as
Fredericksburg, Va. Its path was ap
parently downward, and if left behind a
cloud of rounded form like a puff of
smoke. Scon after the flash a series of
terrific explosions was heard like the dis
charge of a thousand cannon. These were
heard throughout Delaware and the
greater part of New Jersey. It was com
puted that the height of this meteor
when first 'seen was sixty miles, and
when it exploded its height was over
twenty mile?. The length of its visible
path wan more than forty miles. It de
scribed this path in two seconds, so that
its velocity, relative to that of the earth,
was twenty miles per second. The
column of smoke resulting from the ex
plosion was a thousand fct in diameter
ar.d several miles in length.
On August 2. 1SC0, about 10 o'clock at

throughout the whole region from Pitts

Three years ago Mr. Johnson purchased
eight acres of land in the Los Angeles
River bottom. Upon it he constructed a
gigantic pigeon loft 24 feet wide. 69 feet
long and IS feet high. This loft is faced
on every side of tht exterior by ten "tiers
of nefcUL The interior is also devoted to
nesting. Eight narrow aisles afford the
passageway to their homes of thousands
Cff pigeons. On each side of every aisie
the line of nests extends the entire length
cf the building from floor to ceiling. This
immense main loft has 5009 nests. Ths
resting placei are so overcrowded that
many birds nest en the ground.
The ranch was originally stocked with
S0O0 birds, 2000 cf which were purchased
from one man. These comprised his entire
outOt, which at that time occupied the
largest pigeon ranch in the world. So re
markably rapid was the increase of these
birds â each pair being capable of produc
ing at least six pairs of squabs during the
yearâ that additional quarters were built,
60 that now there are six lofts on the
ranch, each crowded to Us utmost capac
ity.
When the pigeons are six months old
they select their mates and go to nesting.
During the late. fall, winter and spring
there are often cs many as 400 dozen
squabs produced monthly, though at the
present time, oeing molting season, not
over forty dozen are hatched monthly. On
an average 250 dozen squabs are sent to
market every month. The market price
cf squabs varies all the way from $1 50 to
53 per dozen, in Los Angeles about $3 per
dozen is the usual market price. During
the season when they are scarce squabs
Eometimes bring es much as 510 per dozen.
The quantity of food consumed by this
mighty host of pigeons Ie enormous.
Twelve sacks of screenings, eight sacks of
â¢wheat, in addition to a great caldron of
boiled meal, are eaten by this extensive
family daily. Three or four barrels of
stale bread soaked in water are given
during the week. It costs $15 a day to
feed the pigeons. The main requisite to
large, healthy birds and prolific Increase
is an abundance of food of the proper
character.

Captain Lemly theu requested that all
the papers in Admiral Schley's possession
bearing upon the case be supplied, and
Raynor replied that Uie Admiral (Schley)
had no more papers.
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson was
then called to correct his testimony of
yesterday. He was asked by Captain
Lemly about his correspondence with Ad
miral Schley, concerning what the Judge
Advocate denominated a newspaper "col
loquy. The witness took exception to the
use of the word "colloquy," and Captain
Lemly replied that this was the witness'
own characterization.
The letters were then read by the Judg#
Advocate, Commander Hodgson Identi
fying the various documents as they were
separately presented. Raynor said that
If desired the letters would be accepted
as evidence and that they could be print
ed without being read. Captain Lamly
replied, however, that he considered that
the letters have an important bearing
upon the precept Â»nd that therefore he
preferred to read them.
While the reading of the letters be
tween Admiral Schley and Lieutenant
Commander Hodgson and newspaper ar
ticles bearing upon the correspondence
was in progress, Raynor objected to the
reading of one of the newspaper state
ments as Irrelevant. The readiiig had re
quired considerable time.

these, it is explained, have made contracts
for the disposal of their total product for
a long period, and this- fact has undoubt

Plans Are Gigantic. .
The promoters, of whom W. S. Porter
has been the most prominent, have the
assurance of the representatives of the
companies that their stockholders are
likely to take favorable action and ratify
what has been done. Payments will be
made for the existing properties In ac
cordance with the reports of the experts
who were sent to the Kern and McKit

of J40.000.000 of the Associated Oil Com

all assets of companies and leave a mar

the idea of consolidation and active in

stockholders have registered their ap

be made has been agreed upon by the ap

practically everything that can apply- to
the development and protection cf the in
terests of those directly concerned. The
corporation is named The Associated Oil
Company. It has 40,000,000 shares of capi

Will Sampson Be a Witness?
There is much interest in yesterday's
episode concerning Admiral Sampson, and
there Is still doubt as to whether he will
be a witness. It will remain with Admiral
Schley and his counsel to say for what
day. If for any. he shall be called. The
controversy as to the admiral's meaning
in his "Dear Schley" dispatch of May 20
has in no wise been abated by the tenta
tive agreement as to his being summoned.
Counsel on both sides this morning had
before them copies of the dispatch, and
each was trying strenuously to bring the
other to their view of the case.
The first of the witnesses of a previous
day who were recalled to correct their
testimony was Lieutenant Doyle, who
was on the Brooklyn during the battle off
Santiago. He made a number of changes
in phraseology. His attention was called
to an error In his former testimony in
stating the distance the Brooklyn stood
out from the morro at Santiago In reply
to a question by the court. He had
formerly placed this distance at two or
three miles, but he had erroneously based
his statement on the log for June 28 In
stead of for May 28. Looking at the log
of May 28 he found only one estimate of
the distance out. placing it at seven miles.
The "Dear Schley" Letter.
When Lieutenant Doyle was excused
Captain Lemly again brought up the ques
tion of the difference of construction of
the last paragraph of- the "Dear Schley"
letter. He produced the original copy,
reading a part of the paragraph, as fol
lows:
"I therefore am of the opinion that our
best chance of success in capturing their
ships \u25a0will be to hold the two points, Cien
fuegos and Havana, with all the force we
can muster. If later It should develop
that these vesels are at Santiago we could
then assemble off that port the ships best
suited for the purpose and completely
blockade It. Until we then receive more
positive information we shall continue to
hold Havana and Santiago."
Captain Lemly then said:
"If the court please, I was yesterday
requested by counsel for the applicant to
produce the original of the letter from
Admiral Sampson to Commodore Schley,
WASHINGTON. Oct. JL-Only
one session of the Schley
Court of Inquiry wan held to
day. An adjournment until
Monday was taken at 1
o'clock In order to allow the court and
counsel to recuperate after an arduous
week's labors. Practically the only wit
ness of the day was Lieutenant Com
mander Hodgson, who was navigator of
the Â£agshi? Brooklyn during ' the cam
paign cf 1S33. and almost his entire time
was taken up with the reading of corre
spondence between himself and Admiral
Schley concerning en alleged colloquy be
tween them dsrlss' the battle of Santi
ago, which the wltcecs was reported to
have detailed to a newspaper correspond
ent. The correspondence has been pub
lished, and this fact rendered the pro
ceedings of comparatively little popular
interest.
Lieutenant Doyle was on the stand
again, but only for the purpose of cor
recting his former testimony.
Santiago or Cienfuegos.
During the day Judge Advocate Lemly
made another statement concerning Ad
miral Sampson's dispatch Qf May 20. 1S9S,
relating especially to the admiral's use of
:he word "Santiago" where it was al
leged he Intended to use the word "Clen
fuegos."
When the court adjourned last night
Commander Hodgson was In the hands of
Judge Advocate Lemly, whose examina
tion of him partook very largely of thÂ«
nature of a cross-examination. This was
due to the fact that Hodgson had been
called by both sides of the controversy
and was considered even more a Bchley
witness than a Government witness. Cap
tain Lemly and Hanna continued the In
quiry for the Government at the begin
ning of the sitting to-day, after which
Raynor began a series of questions In
tended to present the Schley side of the
conduct of the Brooklyn during not only
the battle of July 3* but of the entire San
tiago campaign. Hanna's inquiries were
devoted partly to developing more of the
details concerning the bombardment of
the Spanish ship Cristobal Colon on May
SX The entire correspondence between
. Commander Hodgson and Cominodore
Schley was also put in as evidence.

It has been repeatedly stated that the
Macedonian committee Is responsible for
the kidnaping. The committee, it is said,
organized several bands of brigands as a
part of its anti-government operations,
one "of which, under Sarapoff, former
president of the - committee, seized Miss
Stone and her woman companion. A de
tachment of 300 soldiers, whose numbers
have since: been added to, has been un
able to flnd any trace of her whereabouts,
although it Is said they have searched the
mountains on the Bulgarian frontier. It
is stated that .a second letter from Miss
Stone has been received in Samakoff, beg
ging that no pursuit of the brigands be
made, because when they are hunted they
drag her about from place to place. She
is already so fatigued by interminable
marches that Jhe is unable to walk. She
makes no allegation of ill treatment. Ne

Although everything baa apparently
been done by the American board and the

tives and friends of Miss Stone in this
city, who at first did not give the Question
of ransom much consideration, have now
became aroused, believing the brigands
mean what they say, and that unless
something is done at once Miss Stone and
her companion will be killed. \u25a0
Of the money subscribed to-day $10,000

garia has promised to do all In its power
to effect the release of the young woman.
In order- that no means may be left un
tried pressure is being applied to' the
Macedonian committee which is said to
be concerned Sn the abduction.
These facts .were brought out to-day
after a conference of President Roosevelt
with Dr. Samuel Capen, president of the
American Board of Missions, and Dr.
Judson Smith. ; foreign secretary of the
board. Drs. Capen and Smith strongly
appealed to the President .to exert every
effort to bring about the release of the
American captive. Dr. Capen said upon
the conclusion of the conference that he
was satisfied the Government was spar
ing no effort to accomplish this result.
None of the' parties to the conference
were disposed to discuss what passed, but
it is learned that Dr. Capen made a com
plete statement of Miss Stone's plight,
and Mr. Adee, acting Secretary of State,
related the steps already taken by the
State Department. Russia's influence
has been sought because of the peculiar
relations she has with Bulgaria. Her In
fluence is exceedingly strong in Sofia, and
its exercise will be effective in causing
the adoption of every measure that may
lead to the rescue of Miss Stone.
A report has been received here giving
the present location of Miss Stone and
her captors, but It is not considered re
liable. Fears are entertained that If Bul
garia send an expedition to forcibly res
cue Miss Stone she will be murdered. For
this reason Drs. Capen and Smith have
given cordial approval to. the movement
initiated; in Boston yesterday to raise Im
mediately, by public subscription the $110,

people of the best traditions of Prussian
justice. One paper says: "At any rate,

many badly."
General satisfaction is expressed at the
reports that Prince Clung; has given as
surances that the Dowager Empress and
the Emperor agree as to the necessity for
a change in the Chinese system of Gov
ernment and that reform edicts will be
enforced upon the return of the court.
Prince Chun, the Chinese special envoy,
and his retinue lived three weeks here at
the expense of Emperor William and the
empire. Even the excursions were paid
for.
Cases of insubordination which have
occurred on board the German cruiser
Gazelle recently have been much ventil
ated in the press. . The secretiveness of
the officials on the subject is condemned
and the natural result is that there has
been considerable exaggeration.
The Hallesches Volksblatt (Social Dem
ocrat), claims there was a mutiny on 4
board the vessel, which is commanded by
Captain Neitzke, a severe, disciplinarian.
The sailors, who had served in China,
were called upon to perform the strictest
service and they complained that their,
food was not satisfactory. f r \u25a0
The statement made three weeks a(jo
that the instruments were purchased an:l
not looted has not been officially refuted.
The Neuste Nachrichten says it is not
sufficient to place the instruments at the
disposal of the Chinese, a.nd proposes to
offer -,:to transport v them .back to China
and replace them at Germany's expense
on the spots from which they were taken.
If Chinais unwilling to do so, and deduct
the amount from the indemnity.'

The, whole press practically agrees thai
the -astronomical instruments were il
legally carried.. off. Even the Kreuz -
tung criticises, the action of the Germ is
as follows: â¢ '\u25a0
"The instruments were manifestly
taken unlawfully. The perpetrators un
doubtedly acted in good faith, but that

can be done. is to deduct the- value of the
instruments from the Chinese indem

\u25a0 Mrs. Brown was taken to thÂ« Central
Emergency Hospital, where a severe
scalp wound she had sustained was
dressed.
Horn, who is well known to the police
as an eccentric and dangerous character,
got under, the influence of morphine last
night and as he passed the crowd of
women at the corner he began to scream
and threw his arms about 4 in a wild man
ner. The women scattered in all direc
tions, for Horn was armed with a vicious
looking slungshot, which he held in hia
right hand and swung- wildly about hia
head. A well dressed middle aged woman
who gave her name as Mrs. Mary Brown
was not quick enough in getting out of
the madman's way and received a sting
ing: blow on the head from the slung
shot. She fell to the pavement and Horn
then attacked a young woman whose
name could not be learned and struck her
a vicious blow in the face with his wea
pon, splitting her upper lip.
At -this -juncture - Thoman Kiley, a
Btevedore who was under the influence of
liquor, mixed In the fray and for a time
it looked as if serious bloodshed would
result. Captain Wittman, who was pass
ing-, took a hand and after disarming
Horn placed him under arrest. Riley,
who became obstreperous, was i also
placed under arrest. In the patrol wagon
Horn, who by this time was well nigh
frenzied, attacked Policeman Hennebery
and a struggle between the two ensued.
Policeman George Douglass came to Hen
nebery's assistance and the morphine
fiend was overpowered.
At the. City Prison Horn was booked on
ib. charge of an assault with a deadly
weapon. Riley was booked on a charge
of disturbing the peace.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 5.â The latest ad

the military authorities intend to take
prompt and vigorous measures for â¢ the
suppression of the insurrection in the
Island of Samar and that attention will
be directed first to the summary punish
ment of the treacherous natives who took
part in the massacre of Company C,
Ninth Infantry, at Balangiga.
There is, therefore, every prospect that
the island of Samar will be the theater
of active hostilities for some time to

Chaffee to teach the rebellious inhabit
ants a lesson and force them to respect
the power and sovereignty of the United

WRATH STORED
FOR FILIPINOS
There have been two opposing interests
in the oil fields for â¢some time. One desires
to have the price of oil put down. The
other wishes to Jiave oil pay a profit to
the producers. From this latter Impulse
has come the organization of the Associ
ated Oil Company. W. S. Porter of Los
Angeles, who has handled other large
deals, was brought to San Francisco some
time ago to work for the consolidation of
interests. His pay was made contingent
upon the success of the enterprise. His
fees will reach a i .very large sum,
enough, In fact, to constitute a fortune
for most men. ( Mr. Porter opened an of
fice in the Mills building and has devoted
all his time since his arival to the work
in hand. ' . '
Henry Ach said last evening that the
proposition of the Standard Oil Company
to construct a pipe line from Bakersfleld
to tide water had no concern for the men
who compose the Associated Oil Company.
The purpose of the new corporation was
to handle the product of the fields and a
pipe line was considered by the promoters
to be essential to success in that direction.
Whether the line would run to Stockton
or. to -some other place was a. matter of
detail to be considered when the time
comes. \u25a0\u25a0
The -size 'of the issue of bonds . to be
authorized cannot be forecasted. A bond
Issue will be necessary - to provide the
money needed to construct the pipe line,
sailing or steam vessels to be operated,
tanks, power houses and power plants,
water plants and other accessories and in
dispensable .parts of the great enterprise
the Associated Oil Company has been ln
corporated to carry on. . --\u25a0 . â¢
Two Opposing Interests.
The men connected with the movement
to bi'ing about the consolidation of the
Kern and McKittrick fields, under ono
management and under one ownership,
took great pains to" ascertain the values
of the actual producing companies in tho
two districts and appraisements were con
fined to companies that have demonstrat
ed the possession of and actual production
of oil in paying quantities. To find the
facts not only were the books of these
companies consulted but the capacity of
the properties was* actually tested by the
experts selected to go into the fields. - -
In addition to this the geological struc
ture of the several locations was consid
ered with care to ascertain the manner
In which the oil strata were laid down.
When this had been done the chemical
constituents -of all the oils taken out by
the various companies were determined in
chemical laboratories situated near the
wells, expert chemists being employed to
make the tests. In short, everything was
done that could tend to throw light upon
the actual and prospective values of the
properties. V \u25a0
When this was nearly completed pre
dictions were made by persons who seem
ed to be interested in preventing the for
mation of the proposed combination that
the companies would pull apart when the
question of valuation of their properties
came up. This difficulty would seem to
have. been overcome if the belief of the
representatives of the several companies
who ' have conferred with the promoters
concerning the future action-, of their
stockholders is verified. i \u25a0"-

Power is given to purchase any and all

rights to secret processes for the refining
of the crude oil or other manipulations of

erations of the corporation are not con
fine,d by the articles of incorporation to

all sorts of materials connected, with the

"The court decides that any clippings
from. newspapers which form a part of
the correspondence between Schley and
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson should
properly.be read." \u25a0
Raynor â May It please the court," there
is no evidence to show that this particular

Allen said that he next heard of the
matter when Hawkes came to him and
said he wanted a settlement of his claim.
He told Hawkes he had nothing what
ever to do with the concern and never
had, and after a brief conversation
Hawkes had expressed the same opinion,
but asserted that Heistand had told him
that witness was in it. He again saw
General Corbia. who said that Hawkes
had been to him also with the same cla'm.
General Corbin had told him he had noth
ing to do with the concern.
Lieutenant Colonel Heistand then was
called and cross-examined" by Major
Hawkes regarding certain conversations
between them. Replying to one query
Heistant lemarked' that Hawkes "whim
pered." Hawkes said in an excited man
ner:-- -< >\u25a0."> :
"Did you ever see me whimper?"
"I did," responded Heistand.
"You lie!" shouted Major Kawkes
Senator Cockrell rebuked Hawkes and
declared that no such language was per
missible. Nothing of importance was de
veloped by the cross-examination of Col
onel Heistand. At Its conclusion the com
mittee adjourned until Monday. . .
"Heistand, your man Hawkes is using
Secretary Allen's name in connection with
that hemp company. You must call him
off."
Heistand replied that he would da so at
once.
Allen declared in the most emphatic
manner that he never had any connection
with the proposed hemp company. He
added that he had not taken and had not
been asked to take any stock in such
company or combination. He also assert
ed that in no circumstances would he
have taken stock or engaged in any such
business. The testimony contradicted
that of Colonel Heistand, who had said
that he (Heistand) had approached "As
sistant Secretary Allen and asked him to
take stock, and that Allen said he would
if it were all right.
Governor Allen said that he had no rec
ollection whatever of any such conversa

said that his first recollection of the' pro
posed hemp combination was a telephone
message to the effect that his name was
being used in New York in connection
with it. Investigation showed that

It is with great regret that I announce that

take great pleasure In meeting with you at
the time that the ticket is ratified and ex
pressing to you then his unqualified support
of the- ticket and platform on which we stand
In the campaign that we are about to wage.
While the committee was out seeking
the nominee for Mayor the final motions
appointing the purity and vacancy com
mittee were passed. The crowd in the
gallery, which had been awaiting the re
turn of Bartlett and Sweigert with the
nominee, saw them return, whisper to the
chairman and then take their seats. It
was evident that Tobin could not be
found, and it scarcely needed the speech
of Bartlett to apprise the convention of
the fact. He spoke as follows:
At 9:25 the convention had completed
the ticket. There was no contest for any
office.
Mayoralty Nominee Not Present.
J. S. Waddell, who was announced "as
the only Democrat ever elected to the
Assembly from the Thirty-ninth District,"
was nominated for Sheriff by J. Early
Craig of the Thirty-fifth District and
chosen by acclamation.
John H. Wise was placed in nomination
for Auditor by Delegate Pringle and
chosen by acclamation. He was Intro
duced to the convention as one of the
tried and true old warhorses of the party.
He said the nomination came as a sur
prise.
A. G. Maguire nominated Franklin K.
Lane for City and County Attorney in a
brief speech. No other name was men
tioned and Lane was nominated by ac
clamation.
' Dr. Thomas B. AV. Leland was nomin
ated for Coroner by Joseph Rothschild.
He had no opponent. He was also nom
inated to fill the unexpired term.
George Dahlbender, a delegate from the
Forty-tifth District, was placed in nom
ination for County Clerk by W. A. Kelly
of the Thirty-fifth District. His nomina
tion came as a surprise to the convention.
Dahlbender when called â¢ to the platform
said It was his first appearance before a
convention.
At the suggestion of the chairman a
motion was made that the secretary be
instructed to cast the ballot for the gen
tlemen reported favorably by the com
mittee, so they were officially declared
the Democratic nominees for Supervisors.

That gentleman, whose career is brighten
than a Welsbach. light, will be our next Mayor.
Cheers were given again for Tobin
when the secretary announced the ballot.
A committee was sent out to find the
nominee.

that he had no money to take home to his
family he preferred to die rather than

ENJOYABLE MTJSICALE
FOR CHTTRCH BENEFIT
The election proclamation omits calling
for the choice of a Coroner lor the unex
pired term. It is probable under the cir
cumstances that Dr. Leland will decline
this part of h!s nomination.
A further reason why the Election Com
missioners would be pleased to see no
nomination for this unexpired term is
that with the names already submitted
there will be no room on the ticket for
additional names. This is due to a scar
city of paper, enly a supply sufficient to
comply with the law being obtainable
from the Secretary of State, thus pre
venting an enlargement in case other pe
titions might be filed later.
Immediately after the adjournment of
the convention the committee in charge
cf the filing of the certificate of nomina
tion repaired to the ottice of Registrar
ualsh, who, together with Commissioner
v oorsanger and Chief Deputy Zemansky.
was in waiting. Although a form had
been prepared in advance, it only lacked
twenty-five minutes of midnight before
matters were adjusted. Registrar Walsh
indorsed the tiling of the certificate at
11:35 p. m.
R. P. Troy, Louis de F. Bartlett and
Charles A. Swtigert composed the com
mittee in charge of the filing of the cer
tificate I and were assisted by Secretary
Hickey. Each one anxiously scanned the
clock as the minutes slipped away. This
is the first time in the history of the Reg
istrar's office that one of the lpa-V->~
ties haa been so late in filing: the nomina
tion certificate.

HE Democratic local convention
II completed its nominations at Met
! ropolitan Temple last evening and
11 adjourned sine die. The ticket was
filed in the office of the Registrar
of-voters before midnight. A Notary was
brought to the Temple to attest the cer
tificates, in order to avoid unnecessary
delay.
The slate prepared by the Democratic
managers was handed back without the
trace of a fracture. Not the slightest op
position to the programme was displayed,
but, on the other hand, the slate was ac
cepted with occasional shouts of approval.
Jcsepn S. Tobin was nominated for
Mayor. The nominee is a Native Son, a
banker and a lawyer and a member of
the present Board of Supervisors. He is
a son of Robert J. Tobin, secretary of
the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society

KIDNAPED
Ismar, the Gypsy, Locates the
Parents of Alice Weber
of San Francisco.
From time to tima there have been ap-
pearing 1 in this paper accounts of the
wonderful workings of Ismar, the famous
Egyptian seeress. But perhaps nothing:
has so clearly demonstrated Ismar's pow-
ers as 'what she has accomplished for
Alice Weber, a San Francisco saleslady.
Following is Miss Weber's own story,
which she related to a reporter before
leaving for Melbourne. Australia:
"Yes, as far :.sÂ« I can learn, I was kid-
naped in 1S75, just twenty-five years ago,
and up to last June I had not the least
idea who I was or where I was born. A
matron in a foundling asylum In Denver,
Colo., where I was an occupant until I
was 17 years of age, told me when I left
that institution that I had been left upon
the doorsteps, a child of about 3 years
old. She told me that a note pinned tc*
my dress stated that I belonged to a
prominent family and had been kidnaped
and held for ransom 'for six months. The
reason stated for leaving me there was
that my family had met with financial re-
verses since my abduction. With this In-
formation as to who I was I have strug-
gled on, and with every penny I could
spare out of my earnings I tried by means
of detective agencies and the personal col-
umns of newspapers to locate my parents,
without success.
"From Denver I came to San Francisco
and obtained a pocition in a department
store, and by attending strictly to busl-
â¢ ness was advanced to the position of
buyer for my department. Having read
so much in the newspapers of Ismar's
wonderful powers. I decided to call upon
this famous seeress at her office, 114S Mar-
ket- street, opposite Sixth street.
"Ismar read ivy past like an open book,
and among many other things she told
me that my father was dead and that my
mother had married again and was living 1
in Melbourne. Australia, at the present
time, and that I would be with her before
the end of the present year. An answer
to a letter addressed to my mother In
Melbourne has proved to me the correct-
ness of all Ismar's statements, even to j
the fact that they had moved there from
Montreal. Canada."
Away off in Australia an anxious moth-
er awaits the arrival of the vessel bring-
ing her long-lost daughter home. Miss
Weber's last words were that Ismar has
the next place in her heart after her
; mother.
To one and all, no matter what yonr
: troubles be, come to Ismar. She will tell
: you what you want tc know and set your
affairs aright, whether they be business or
', family ones. Ismar can be consulted dally
from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m.: Sundays from 10
to 12. at her office. 1148 Market street, two
doors below Weinstock & Lubln's.

V^y\>V\V presided at the meet-
Tj-f.'X: ing of California Chap-
ter of the Order of the
Eastern Star on the 21st Inst. for the first
time since' their return from Louisville,
Ky., where they attended the conclave of.
the Knights Templar. Almost the entire
membership was present, and there were
also in the chapter room visitors from
many parts of the State and from a num
ber of Eastern States. The officials named
were accorded a most generous, welcome
and would have been made the guests of
honor at a banquet, but this was deferred
on account of the chapter being in mourn
ing for the late President. During the
evening two applicants for admission info
the chapter were elected, two petitions
were received and the following named
ten candidates were initiated by the of
ficers-in a manner that surpassed any
previous effort: J. R. and Mrs. Jenkel,
E. D. and Mrs. Mendell, Gotlieb and Mrs.
Witmer, Mrs. Lilian Gately, Misses
Sophia and Josie Miller and R. H. Mc-
Pherson. John Tonnlngsen, Emma F. J Lel
bold and Anna Boxton, appointed by the
matron a committee on resolutions to the
memory of the late President McKlniey,
presented a series that were couched in
the most feeling language. These were
adopted by a rising vote and it was de*
elded that the same should be spread on
the minutes and that an engrossed copy
be forwarded to Mrs. Ida McKinley, who
is a member of the order at her home in.
Canton. This chapter particularly feels
the "nation's, loss by reason of the tact
that during the visit of the late President
to this city he manifested a deep interest
in its welfare because his wife had been,
specially invited to attend one of its ses
sions. The chapter has decided to meet
hereafter on the first and third Thursdays
of each month. An appropriate finale to
the session was the rendering on the lute
by Brother Adelstein of "Nearer, My God,
to Thee" and "Ave Maria," of sacred se
lections by -the quartet and the singing of
"Sweet Spirit, Hear My Prayer," by Mrs.
Ralph Hathorn.

bers in the hall of Beuian Chapter on the

were Grand ' Secretary Mrs, K. J. Willats,
Past Grand Patron G. L. Darling, Past
Grand Organist Mrs. Darling, and Mrs.
H. M. Owens, who during the evening wan

tion of her kindness in naving on a num
ber of occasions sung for the chapter dur
ing ceremonies. After the work of the

LONDON, Oct. 5.â There is a flutter in
high society , owing to the fact that the
Karl Marshal has issued the rules , and
regulations governing what is to be worn
at the coronation of King Edward next
year. The whole document breathes of
the -, middle ages, when distinctions in
dress were considered so essential and the
quaintness of the phraseology in which
the attendance of the nobility of the
United. Kingdom is required "at th.Â»
solemnity of the royal coronation of their
most' sacred majesties," and' describing
the regulations in regard to dresses and
head dresses is distinctly medieval.
There is a curious gradation in the fur
trimmings of the robes which emphasizes
the fine distinctions existing in the ranks
of the aristocracy. All the Peers have
peen notified that their robes must be of
"crimson velvet, edged with \u25a0 miniver, the
cape furred with miniver, pure and pow
dered with bars or rows of ermine, ac
cording to their degree."
\u25a0Here follow the numerical graduations
distinguishing between the ranks. .Barons
are allowed two rows of ermine, Viscounts
two and ia half rows. Earls three rows,
Marquise* three and: a half rows and
Dukest four rows, i All the mantles and
robes must be worn over full court dress,
uniform or regimentals. \u25a0 - . . ; .
The Earl Marshal's order . banlshes
counterfeit pearls and all jewels from
coronets, which. are to be "silver gilt, the
caps of crimson velvet, turned up with
ermine, with gold tassels on top. No
Jewels or precious stones, are. to be set in
coronets, nor counterfeits of pearls in
stead of silver balls." The number of the

scheme for the crossing of Unter den Lin
den by street car lines, Herr Singer, the
local Democratic leader, violently at
tacked the Chief Burgomaster, saying he
oug-ht to go to the castle and kowtow,
as he had been there three times and the
Kaiser had refused an audience to him
each time.
Chief Burgomaster Kirschner replied
hotly, urging the assembly to bear in
mind the respect it owed to the head of
the state. He approved the resolution,
however, and expressed the hope that the
city would yet obtain what-it wanted. .
Later on in the discussion Hefr Singer
referred to Emperor William's speech to
the Alexander Regiment of Guards, In
which his Majesty said that he would/if
necessary, quell the Impudence and in
subordination of the Berliners with . the
bayonets of the guards.
Herr Kirschner again replied. He said
that the Emperor's words were not . as
strong as reported. They were also ex
plicable from, a psychological and human
point of view, as the speech was delivered
Just after the attack on the Kaiser at
Bremen. Nevertheless, Herr Kirschner
admitted the imperial speech had pained
him.
latter permitted revives a nice sense of
distinction. A Baron's coronet bears six
silver balls, a Viscount's, sixteen, an
Earl's eight with gold strawberry leaves
between, a Marquis' four balls and four
leaves alternately. A Duke's coronet has
no balls and has only eight gold straw
berry leaves. v_: " x
The Earl Marshal next prescribes the
robes, mantles and coronets to be worn
bv the Peeresses. These are of the same
materials as the men's, with similar grad
uations in the number of bars of ermine
and balls. The length of the trains mark
the difference in rank. A Baroness fc; only
allowed a train of three feet, a Viscount
ess has one and a quarter yards, Count
esses have one and a half yards, a Mar
chioness has one and three-quarter yards
and a Duchess two yards. â¢
Then follows a curt, notification - as to
who shall be excluded. Peeresses in their
own right and widows of Peers are al
lowed to attend, but widows who have
remarried beneath their rank in the.peer
age are "not entitled to a summons to
attend the coronation."

ment of the District Court of Shawnee
County in the case of the State against

Assassin Bresci's Wife Disappears.
JCEW YORK, Oct. 5.â Mrs. Bresci. wife
of the murderer of King Humbert, has
left Cliffside Park, N. J. She had little to
take away, for the furniture in her board
ing-house did not belong to her. She de
fied the Borough Council two weeks ago

would remain :n the town despite all ef
forts to oust her. It is not known where

SAYS THEY DEFRAUDED
BY MESMERIC MEANS
London Detective .Inspector Gathers
Sensational Evidence Against a
Man and Woman.
LONDON, Oct. 5.â Detective Inspector
Kane, who has charge of the prisoners
giving their names as Theodore and
Laura Horos. who are in custody here on
the charge of conspiring to defraud
women of jewelry and money by fortune
telling, said this evening:
"There is no doubt that Laura Horos is
the former wife of General Diss Debar.
though she is married now to a man
named Jackson, with whom she has been
living for some time in England and on
the Continent. There is no doubt that
they are both mesmerists. They- could
not* otherwise have obtained the influence
they had over their English victims. We
have a mass of evidence, including a
charge of assault against the man and
one of active assistance against the
\u25a0woman. Probably there also will be a
charge of felony forthcoming. The mag
istrate has promised to devote three days
to the case, so voluminous is the evidence.
COBN MARKET -SOAHING"
THE CAUSE OF FAILURE
Large Grain Firm Operating at Miu-
neapolis Forced to Make an
Assignment.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Oct. 5.-J. Q.
Adams & Co. of this city, who have con
ducted one of the largest grain receiving
and exporting houses in the Northwest
under the name of the St. Paul and Kan
sas City Grain Company, have made an
assignment to Fred V. Van Dusen and
P. B. Smith. The assignees are not pre
pared to state the amount of the liabili
ties or the value of the assets of the com
pany. The company owns or controls
seventv country elevators. â¢
The J. Q. Adams Company proper is
capitalized at $250,000 and the St. Paul
and Kansas City Grain Company at
$150,000. The assignment is made in the
name of the St. Paul and Kansas City
Grain Company. The assignees will con
tinue the business. It Is 1 stated the failure
is due to loss accrued last spring in the
May corn corner. The company had a
large amount of corn stored at Duluth,
which was â¢â¢hedged" at Chicago. When
the price of corn "soared" at Chicago the
company, being unable to deliver the corn
at Duluth on the Chicago contracts, was
forced to sell it at a lower price than the
option was then selling for in order to
prevent further losses at Chicago, thereby
losing heavily.
LONDON. Oct. 5.-The wedding of Miss
Helen Morton, daughter of Levi P. Mor
ton, former Vitfe President of the United
States, and Count Boson de Perigord, a
son of the Duke of Talleyrand-Perigord,
was celebrated to-day at St. Mary's Cath
olic Church. Chelsea, with considerable
display. The church was lavishly deco
rated with palms and ferns, all the pews
were festooned with white chrysanthe
mums and red roses and the side chapels
were hung with garlands of flowers.
Joseph H. Choate, the United States
Embassador, and Mrs. Choate, and Lord
Pauncefote, the British Embassador to
the United States, and Lady Pauncefote,
were among Â«he first guests to arrive.
They were conducted to seats facing the
altar. Mr. Choate immediately crossed
the aisle and cordially shook bands with
Lord Pauncefote.
The Duchess of Marlborough was almost
the last to enter the church. She wore
a blue costume trimmed with sable. The
Duchess of Talleyrand-Perigord had on a
magnificent mauve costume. Both the
United States and French embassies were
well represented. The guests were con
ducted to their seats by W. C. Eustis,
third secretary of the United States em
bassy here and brother-in-law of the
bride, and J. R. Carter, second secretary
of the embassy, and others.
The bride, leaning on her father's arm,
arrived at 1 o'clock. She wore a rich
cream satin gown trimmed with lace, had
an orange wreath and carried a bouquet
of white flowers. She was followed by
the bridesmaids, her sisters Alice and
Mary. Count Boson de Perigord, attend
ed by his best man. Count de Crisnoy,
awaited the bride at the altar.
In the absence of the Bishop of Em
roaus the Rev. Father Kelley officiated at
the simple, brief service, which was con
cluded with an exhortation by Father

A small but enthusiastic tribe of bard
lovers will well remember thÂ© good little
"Royal Italian Marine Band" that played
to such pitifully scant houses last year at
the California Theater and came to grief
at the end of Its season there. Not least
among Its attractions will they remember
the handsome and accomplished solo
trombone player, Creatore. whose musi
cianly work created so much attention.
This year Signor Creatore is leader of the
band in place of Minoliti, the competent
but melancholy person who last year led
Ellery Channlng's organization into fa
vor. It may also be remembered that thg
band split into two sections here, a Mino
liti and a Creatore faction, and that one
went north and the other south, or, to bo
more exact, the Minolltis went to an ar
tistic extinction somewhere Seattle
ward, and the Creatores walked into
glory In Philadelphia. Creatore has been,
quite the reigning band sensation of tho
East this season. He has been freely
compared with Sousa, and quite frequent
ly to thÂ© disadvantage of the last named
and has achieved an altogether enviabla
reputation in his line. This la all apropos
to the fact that Mr. Channlng'3 band,
will be here this coming week to begin aa
engagement at the Alhambra,
formance. It is a fine effort, thÂ» clumsy
passion, punchinello braggadocio and ma
licious mischief of tho character being
given with the aptest art, and the sing
er's rendering of the famous "Prologue"
fit course delights. And the admirable
usefulness of Birbareschi, who assumed
successfully the role of Nedda on Thurs
day night on shortest notice, should not
pass without note. This week both Sa
lassa and Barbareschl will again delight
us in "Nsbucco," that In response to a
large demand will be repeated, and this
rare opportunity of hearing Verdi's first
opera should by no means bÂ© neglected
by any student of operatic literature.

TJ2&TT^OTZ,2s/L DIVORCE X-.-A/WS.
The Bar Association aims to bring about the adoption of laws in conformity with its rec
ommendations by the Legislatures of the various States, and efforts to that .end have already been
made in many quarters. It will be seen that the recommendations of the bar do not affect the
phases of the issue with which the church deals. It is with the bar merely a question of bringing
order out of confusion, and the plan proposed leaves each State to- decide for itself what shall con
stituted valid ground for a dissolution of the marriage bond within' its jurisdiction.
FOR a long time past the increasing frequency of divorces among the people of this
country, and the variety and laxity of the laws on the subject in different States, have been
topics of earnest disctfssion on the part of lawyers, moralists' and sociologists. The churches
have been compelled to interpose, and in some cases have refused to recognize certain
legal divorces, to the extent at least that their clergy have been forbidden to officiate at marriages
between parties one or the other of which has been legally divorced, but upon grounds the church
refuses to recognize as sufficients
To the bar the problem has been as serious as to the church. There is now such a confusion
in our marriage laws that it is difficult for the ablest lawyer to determine in some cases whether a
man has been legally divorced or not, or to what extent a divorce granted in one State is recog
nized as valid by the courts of another. A church can make legulations for itself on such subjects
that will be binding upon its clergy and its membership, but the bar has no such advantage. For
that reason there has been an earnest effort on the part of many of the eminent members of the bar
to bring abput the enactment of something like a uniform divorce law throughout the nation
The aim of the bar differs from that of any of the churches, inasmuch as.it does not concern itself
with what grounds may be made, a sufficient basis for divorce so long as the statutes of. the vari
ous States agree.
For'the purpose of ridding our laws of this confusion the American Bar Association at its
recent meeting at Denver recommended that no divorce be granted in any State unless the
grounds for the suit were valid in the State where the parties had lived : and where the cause arose.
Where the suit is brought in the State where the cause arose the person seeking a divorce must have
had an actual residence of one year; where the cause arose in a State other than that in which the
suit is brought, the applicant must have had a residence of two years in the State where he seeks
relief. It was further recommended that no person be entitled to a divorce 'unless the . defendant
shall have been served personally with a process, except that when the defendant cannot be found
after a diligent search of six months, it shall be lawful to the court to' authorize publication of the
suit and grant a decree. . â¢
The new drama by Sir Henry Irving's
son Lawrence, "Richard Lovelace," E. H.
Sothern's offering at the Garden Theater,
is another rather mixed metropolitan suc
cess. The story winds about thÂ© courtly
poet's life as it is known with consider
able truth to history, but, with the excep
tion of the third act (where Lovelace,
mortally wounded, eees again his former
sweetheart. Lucy Sacheverell. now mar
ried to his treacherous friend Hawley),
that Is unanimously described as strong,
moving and sympathetic, thÂ© play is not
regarded as a distinguished example of
dramatic craftsmanship. Mr. Sothern has
won much personal favor aa Lovelace,
and Cecilia Loftus, whose appearance in
John Drew's new play at the Empire,
In which he has a part that is said to fit
him like a glove, is "The Second in Com
mand." a four-act comedy by Captain
Marshall, whose "A Royal Family" has
of late so delighted thÂ© play-goers here.
Mr. Drew's role Is that of a major in thÂ©
English army, who Is always late for the
good things of life, late in love, latÂ© In
war. everywhere too late. The comedy is
said to have all the brilliance and clarity
of construction that commonly distin
guishes Captain Marshall's work.
A play that Is bound to meet with a con
tinuance of the distinguished favor that
greeted its first appearance at the New
York Theater Republic on the 23rd ult. is
Ian Maclaren's "The Bonnie Brier Bush,"
done into drama by James McArthur and
Augustus Thomas. I wish I might quote
in full William 'Winter's appreciation of
"dear old Stoddart" in the part of Lach
lan Campbell, In which tho veteran actor
has madÂ© his reappearance on the stage
\u25a0with 6uch distinguished success. Here Is
a bit of It, however; the critic Is speaking
of that touching Incident of Campbell's
erasure of hia daughter's name from thÂ©
family Bible,
In Mr. Etoddart'B acting, on the other hand,
the effect Is bo afflicting and lamentable that
it seems above all art and scarcely can be
borne. ICothlng eo elmply touching, so rev
erend, eo awful in Its tremendous purpose of
Justice, and bo deplorable in its weakness of
human griet has been seen on our stage. In
the element of simplicityâ In the something that
comes straight from the heart and goes straight
to the hearts of othersâ this impersonation tran
ecends anything of its class that the present
<Jay has known. â¢ â¢ â¢
It did not seem to be acting:â It had all the
truth of reality. The audience was greatly
moved. The performance Is one that every
body should see. It adorns the theater. It
vindicates the uses of the drama. It is an
honor to human nature, and it will prove a
great publio beneflt^âcomlng, as It does. In a
time when each blessings as a pure play and
a great actor are grievously needed.
The opening cf the Manhattan Theater
in New York by Mrs. Fiske is regarded
by the devout play-goer there as one of
the most eignificant happenings of the
year. The theater has been beautifully
decorated, a consistent, elevated and pro
gressive policy for its management an
nounced, and the new era inaugurated
Eome two weeks ago by the production of
Anne Flexner I^ewis' play, "Miranda of
the Balcony." So far a? good acting can
gro, Mrs. Fiske's first offering was finely
â¢successful, but the consensus of opinion
regarding thÂ«Â» play itself is less favorable.
It is granted that "Miranda of the Bal
cony" possesses all the novelty of out
look and atmosphere that was promised;
that it offers oven a great personal oppor
tunity to Mrs. Fiske. but lack of action Is
alleged and a preponderance of the psych
ological rather than the dramatic flavor.
NOW is the flood time and high sea
son of the new play in the East;
these the days of the tasting of
the new drama, and perhaps a
glance at the dramatic menu that
rr.ay be ours next year if we are good,
may not prove uninteresting.
tb Â£ grreatest P rais e that can be ac
corded Mr. Haworth's Impersonation Is to say
that it was a constant and vivid reminder o
the Hamlet of Edwin Booth. It was a vor\
human Hamlet, but It did not .fall In poetlV
atmosphere. Then great soliloquies were rea
with marked Intelligence, and the strong (emu'
tation to over emphasize was well resisted
In appearance â¢ Mr. Ha-worth's Hamlet con'
pletely satisfied the most exacting admirer of
the role. It Is picturesque and virile in con
ceptlon and execution, and Mr. Haworth and
his friends may well be pleased with the sue
cess of the creation.
Here is what the Boston Traveler had
to say of Joseph Haworth's Haxnle*
that will be the farewell bill of the StÂ»d
actor's engagement this week at the
Grand Oi>era-house:

her performances that "Cecilia Loftus has

There has been a happy indication that
the audiences of this year at the Tivoli

The assets of the society so far are the

Goewey, Mr. P. N. Lilienthal and Mr.
Robert Tolmie, directors; Paul Steindortf,

bank, and the list of former symphony
society members. Library there is none,
on the other side, without the mortgaged

possession shall, as it legally may, be con
sidered as the property of the society;
there is the public indifference to fight,
scattered enthusiasm to organize, the mu
sicians to inspire and all the thousand
And one other duties incident to initial
organization to be undertaken. But Mr.
Steindorff has said, "It shall be done":
the directors say, "It shall be done," and
I think this time the symphony society
may be looked upon as an assured fact.
Nothing is to bo undertaken in the matter
of concerts until after the Grau grand
opera season in November, when three
trial concerts will be given by Mr. Stein
dorff. Meanwhile those interested are ad
monished to busy themselves in this the
most significant musical movement of the
year.
"With the coming of the Tivoli grand
opera season, however, with its introduc
tion of Mr. Paul Steindorff as a conduc
tor of importance, the directors of the
Symphony Society who have still held to
gether in a forlorn hope again took heart.
They watched Mr. Steindorff's work week
t\j- week with increasing respect. They
'V<Jk the measure of the man, noted his
courage, energy, enthusiasm, artistic at
tainment, unlimited capacity for work, a
gift in handling men, and to their own
surprise found themselves considering
anew the possibility of a symphony so
ciety for San Francisco. Last week they
finally decided that Mr. Steindorff wa3
the man for the hour, met officially and
took the decisive step of electing him con
ductor of the society that is to be.
It affords me the utmost pleasure, O
most polite and perturbed sir, to make the
following very sufficient explanation of
the symphonic silence that has pervaded
these pages; but prepare yourself before
hand for the shock of good news. There
is no grumble coming this year on the
subject of a symphony orchestra for San
Francisco, for and because before San
Francisco is two months older she will
have a symphony society for "which I
think I may venture to prophesy perma
nency, artistic standing and financial sol
vency. This is a large saying, I am
aware, particularly as it is based almost
entirely on the personality of the man
that has been chosen as director of the
orchestra, and in face of the warring
factions into which former societies have
split, and the generally lymphatic and
intermittent interest that has been taken
in the subject for some time now.
But, after all, in a matter of this kind,
it is the personality of the director that
counts; witness the highly successful
symphony seasons here under the mag
netic leadership of Fritz Scheel for ex
ample. Since that day the society has
seen only troublous times, with occasional
gleams of success. Its leaders have be
come the most pessimistic of persons and
the public has lost both confidence and in
terest in the matter.
WHERE, O where, is the custom
ary and necessary grumble on
symphony matters that usually
adorns your, pages at this sea
son?" questions one subscriber
this week among several who concern
themselves with the same subject, and who
owns to something like dismay at having
seen the beginning of the season go by
without anywhere a word of protest as
to this most crying musical need of the
town.
Mr. Bryan may think there is another campaign in, pounding thrashed straw over these old
grants, but* he will be retired to the moldy and mummified company of those Republican politicians
who still think there are votes in the rebel claims issue. We have the roads and they have the
rocky and desert grants, and we only wish there were more lands of that kind to grant railroad
companies which would take them and build more roads.
It is true that the United States also loaned to the Union and Central Pacific roads bonds,
from which they derived $18,000,000 each, to spend on construction, but it also true that these
roads have paid back to the United States every dollar of this loan and every mill of its interest,
and for its loan that yielded the roads only $36,000,000 the United States has pocketed more
than $120,000,000. . ". .
We, who live on this coast and enjoy the railway facilities for travel and transportation
afforded by the overland land grant roads, do not take patiently the criticism of the land grant
policy made by demagogues born on the Illinois Central grant and domesticated in Nebraska' or
elsewhere. The grants that made their country great are treated as politically and economically
proper, while everything done in the same line for the far West is denounced as "a steal," and the
Republican party, which took over and applied a Democratic. policy for our benefit, is character
ized as a thief, robbing the people of their heritage.
MR. BRYAN, who is publishing columns of advice to President Roosevelt on how to run
the government,, has found time to rediscover a grievance and dress it up as a fresh ad
dition to his museum of issues.
He finds that between the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean the Republican
party granted 135,800,000 acres of public lands, to secure the building of railroads. To his mind
this transgression warrants standing the Republican party up ngainst a dead wall and shooting it
through with oratory supplied by himself, Cyclone Davis, and other Populist cartridge makers.
He finds it entirely convenient to forget, and maybe he doesn't know, that the system of
building railroads in advance of population and business, to open up new country by furnishing
transportation, was devised by the Democratic party. It was a wise policy then, and was wiser
when it enabled the building of railroads over the bare and unpeopled stretch of mountain and
desert to reach this coast. Mr. Bryan was born in Illinois. Thi-t State was the first to benefit by a
railroad land grant. When she was bankrupt, and trying to repudiate her public debt, when her
people were few and immigration meager, for there were not facilities to carry- people \here and
their surplus products to a profitable market, Stephen A. Douglas saved Illinois from the dishonor
of repudiation by securing a vast grant of public land to builcf the Illinois Central Railroad. It
was the best of agricultural land, capable of enormous production, but it was unpeopled. The
road brought settlers, took their crops to market, and survived to a paying period on the credit
which the land grant gave it. Admonished by, this experience, land grants in the State of Iowa,
again rich agricultural territory, were given during the administration of President Pierce, when
Marcy was Secretary of State, Linn Boyd of Kentucky Speaker of the House, and Davy Atchison of
Missouri President of the Senate. These grants created the credit which built across Iowa the Mis
sissippi and Missouri, now the C. R. I. and P., the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska, now the C. and
N. W., and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroads, and the Iowa branch of the Illinois Cen
tral, from Dubuque to Sioux. City. Both parties in i860 demanded, government aid to a Pacific
railway, and the grants to the overland roads, which made the shivers run down Bryan's back, fol
lowed in answer to that demand. He speaks of these grants as "monstrous,"' and of the lands
as the heritage of the people for their homes. Not one grant to a Pacific railroad approached in
value that of the Illinois Central. Mr. Bryan knows better, for he has traveled over the Southern
Pacific on a pass, but he fosters the idea that these mountain and desert grants were like the rich
prairie land in the Illindts and Iowa grants, which were made under Democratic administrations.
The fact is the exact contrary. The overland grants look enormous on paper, but in their whole
vast expanse there is rarely a section that equals in production a single forty-acre in Iowa or Illi
nois.. They were land, it is true. They had some, but a low, economic value. They looked well as" a
basis of credit, and helped to build roads which were a military necessity to the government, ?nd
finally enabled such settlement as the country was capable of supporting, and by furnishing trans
portation built up the mining, livestock, and coal business of the West and created the Spates of
Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada.. Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas. Without the roads which those
grants helped to build there would not now be a State in the Union between California and Ne
braska. .

October 4, 1901.
A mass of tables issued by the Govern
ment this week on railways in the United
Kingdom in 1900 is mighty unpleasant
reading for the shareholders, showing in
creased working expenses out of all pro
portion with the increase in receipts. Of
the total paid-uj* capital of Â£1,176,000,000
16. per cent, or Â£187,000,000, is due to nom
inal additions on consolidation, conver
sion and division of the stocks. The av
erage rate of dividend is only 3.45 per cent,
as against 3.C7 per cent in 1899. .
It is the realization of these shortcom
ings which has induced the departure for
New York of several prominent officials
of the Northeastern Railway Company,
including George Gibb, the general man
ager, and Mr. Burtt, the traffic manager,
who sailed on the White Star line steam
er Celtic. The object of their trip is a
month's study of the American railroad
system. ;"
LONDON, Oct. 5.â. The opinion of
Charles T. Yerkes of English railways is
that they must be taken In hand by
Americans and worked in their way, or
else they will be laid down under enor
mous capitalization and wasteful meth
ods. â¢ "..*â¢
The showing of transactions for September is
very encouraging considering the long continu
ance of the labor troubles. It is evidence of the
Inherent vitality of the San Francisco real es
tate market. It Is not to be denied that many
men of wealth have refrained from making in
vestments which they had- intended, and it Is
â¢well known that buyers of a speculative turn of
mind have held off in the hope tBat there would
be a break In prices. This latter class has been
doomed to disappointment, while, despite the
backwardness of others, the total sales of the
past month have aggregated a million dollars.
It is plain from the strength of the market that
It will develop great activity. Already there is
evidence of Improvement in the line of samll
and medium sized purchases, and It only re
mains for the large buyers to overcome their
caution to put affairs back to the point where
they were in the early spring. San Francisco
is bo markedly growing in population and its
future is bo well assured that nothing can keep
this city back. Events may arise to check the
onward inarch, but they are only temporary,
and as soon aa they have passed the forward
course will be resumed. It looks now as If
long strides were to be taken to make up for
the time that has been lost.
The Real Estate Record for October,
published by G. H.Umbsen & CÂ«., has the
following to say concerning the condition
of the market:
Review of Market.

lowing sales:
More sales of realty were made in San

July or August. The sales of last month
numbered 249, representing a total value
of $1,166,870. This volume of business rep
resented all sections but one. The Mis
sion had 78 sales to its credit, with totai
value of $224,475. The Western Addition
showed a total value of $399,S05 for 65
sales. There were 38 sales in the outside

provements' last month than were called
for by the permits of the corresponding
month in 1900. Three-quarters of the year

represented being $5,575,755, as against $4,
570,886 for the same months last year, an

WEAK MADE STRONG
Marvelous Elixir of Life Discovert by
Famous Doctor-Scientist That C res
Every Known Ailment,
Wonderful . Cures Are' Effected That Seem
Like Miracles Performedâ The Secret
of Long Life of Olden Times
Revived.
The Remedy Is Free to All Who
Send Name and Address.
After years of patient study and delving Into
the dusty record of the past, as well as fol-
lowing modern experiments in the realms of
medical science. Dr. James W. Kldd. 1509 First
National Bank building. Fort Wayne, Ind.,
makes the startling announcement that he has
. DR. JAMES WILLIAM KIDD.
, surely discovered the elixir of life.. That he is
able, with the aid of a mysterious compound,
known only to himself, produced as a result of
the years he has' spent In searching for this
precious life-giving boon, to cure any and every
disease that is known to the human body.
There is no doubt of the doctor's earnestness In
making his claim and the remarkable cures
that he is daily effecting seem to bear him out
very strongly. His theory which he advances
is one of reason and based on sound experience
in a medical practice of many years. It costs
nothing to try' his remarkable "Elixir of Life,"
as he calls it, for ho sends it free, to any one
who la a sufferer, in sufficient quantities to
convince of its ability to cure, so there is abso-
lutely no risk to run. Some of the cures cited
are very remarkable, and but for reliable wit-
nesses would hardly be credited. The lame
have thrown away crutches and walked about
after two or thrw trials of the remedy. The
sick, given up by home doctors, have been re-
stored to their families and friends in perfect
health. Rheumatism, neuralgia, stomach,
heart, liver, kidney, . blood and skin diseases
and bladder troubles disappear as by magic.
Headaches, backaches, nervousness, fevers,
consumption,, coughs, colds, asthma, catarrh,
bronchitis and all affections of the throat,
lungs or any vital organs are easily overcome
in a space of time that is simply marvelous.
Partial paralysis, locomotor ataxla, dropay,
gout, scrofula and piles are Quickly and per-
manently removed. It purifies the entire sys-
tem, blood, and tissues, restores normal nerve
power, circulation and a state of perfect health
is produced at once. To the doctor all systems
are alike and equally affected by this great
"Elixir of Life." Send for the remedy to-day.
It Is free to every sufferer. State what you
want to be cured of and the sure remedy for
it will be sent you free by return mall

John Grace Jr. judged the coursing
meeting 1 at Union Park yesterday ln a
manner that was satisfactory to the spec
tators. One of the horses furnished the
young judge did much to make the occa
sion a memorable one for him. At the
close of the run-down and in the course
between Slim and For Freedom young
Grace tried hard to make the wild-eyed
bronco under him behave. With the
stubbornness of the mustang, the horse
Refused to follow the hounds and insisted
on giving a Wild West exhibition. The
judge would have won out had not the
unexpected happened. He leaned forward
ln the saddle and as his head went down
the head or" the bronco came up. In the
clash that followed the judge came out
second best. It was fully five minutes be
fore the stars ceased playing in front of
the rider's eyes, ln the meantime Slim
had outpointed For Freedom with ease.
Ab the judge was not a witness the course
was run orf. For Freedom made,- a quick
pick-up and \u25a0won. -' IJ'*-
The hares were the best of the season.
In addition to the finals of the open stake
a special event is on the card faf. to-day.
Thirty-two of the fastest hounds" are en
tered and spirited coursing- is expected.
The day's results, with Judge John
Grace Jr.'s official scores, are- as follows:

NEW YORK, Oct. 5.â The Shamrock II,
in tow of the tug James Lawrence, left
her. mooringr'buoy In Sandy Hook Bay at
11:15 this morning j bound for the Erie
Basin, where' she arrived at noon. The
tug then went back for the tender Porto
Rico and towed her to the same place.
The yacht's mainsail was unbent and she
will probably be dismantled at once.
After Sir Thomas -Lipton, accompanied
by iMr. Jameson and Mr.. Watson, had
paid a, farewell visit to Colonel Burbank
and his family at .the, military post on
Sandy Hook7the Erin's anchor was hove
up and that yacht steamed direct to New
York. She was saluted by, all the outgo-
Ing steamships on her way up' the harbor
and anchored off the foot of West Thirty
fourth street at 3 p. m. : '
When asked if it were true that he.was
willing to put the captain -and. crew of
the Shamrock on board the Columbia and
allow that yacht's crew to \u25a0 handle the
Shamrock in a series of races, Sir Thomas
said: . \u25a0, \u25a0-
"I would be willing to do it If It Is In
the interest of sport and provided, of
course, the other side is willing." â¢ -
There wl!l be., however, no such race
Monday next, as both the yachts are be
ing stripped and could not be put lh.trim
again for weeks.' Secretary Oddie of the
New- York Yacht Club 'said that suchva
raee might create bad feeling., especially
If the Shamrock shouid win.' Commodore
Kane said the idea was preposterous.
Speaking of his future plans, Sir Thom
as said he was undecided as yet about
his coming engagements, , but that he
would go direct to the Waldorf-Astoria
Monday and that Tuesday evening he
would attend a dinner at the New York
Yacht Club. HÂ» will probably visit Chi
cago about a week hence. The date is
not yet fixed. â¢
Dr. F. Reid Mackay of the. Erin said
there was every reason to believe that
the Shamrock will be laid up in "New
York this winter and that Iri the spring
or next summer she will be raced against
the Columbia, Constitution or any other
ninety-footer. "For," said he, "we be
lieve that she is actually a faster boat
than the Columbia and can beat her if
she is raced again under different condi
tions."
The following letter, which explains it
self, was sent to-day: -
NEW TORK YACHT CLUB, Oct. 6, 1901.
Dear .Sirâ We have to Inform you that the
Columbia has won three out of five races from
the Shamrock II in the match of 1901 with the
Royal Ulster Yacht Club. The America's Cup,
therefore, remains \u25a0with the New York Yacht
Club.

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 5.â The coursing con
tests for the American -Waterloo cup
commenced to-day at Pastime Park, the
first two rounds of the stake beiny run
off. John Grace of San Francisco acted
as judge. The meeting drew a crowd,
mainly made up of coursing enthusiasts
now in the city from outside points. The
faithful- were rewarded by. seeing grood
sport. / ~~
-On to-day's work Mountain Lion, owned
by P. Poe of Pueblo, Colo.;- Haredine.
owned by J. J. Lavin of St. Louis, and
Warburton, nominated by Arthur Hines,
have the call on the stake. Monsoon,
owned by H. G. Becker of St. Louis, is
also a dangerous one. Of . the outside
dogs, Adder, owned by L. F. Bartels;
Rural Artist, belonging to J. H. Rosseter
of San Francisco; Texas Black Lips,
owned by Irwin and Lyons of Texas, and
Bold Barbarian, the property of L. F.
Bartels, \ are all in the stake and show
good form.
The hares were, as a rule, a stronp lot,
but the fast work of the dogs resulterfin
a good percentage of kills. In several
instances the courses were won by clever
working degs. which defeated faster but
less skillful ores.

Mr. Banning said that the offense had
been charged in the language of the stat
ute, that the Government had fully proved
the offense on the trial and the fact that
Paymaster Coxe had the requisite au
thority to 6lgn as such.
O-H-M M..M..M H 1 I-l-M-M :\u25a0!\u25a0:\u25a0!\u25a0Â«
Tne counsel pointed to the fact that the
indictment charged the forgery of the
-name of Colonel Coxe on a voucher for
?4tW deposited by John Cranson, a private
of "Company E, Fourth Regiment, United
States army." and asserted that the in
dictment was not specific because there
were three different 'Fourth regiments'
in the United States army, and tnat there
was no Such thing known in the army as
a "company" of cavalry. Nor was there
any allegation that F. M. Coxe was a
lieutenant colonel' and deputy paymaster
general in the army, nor was there any
allegation that the defendant did forge
the name of F. M. Coxe as such paymas
ter, and that Coxe had power under the
law to make his signature as such.
Mr. Banning, replied and Judge de Ha
ven remarked that the serious allegation
was whether Coxe was . authorized to
draw up and sign this obligation of the
United States.
Ex-Captain John M. Neall, convicted of
forgery, was to have been sentenced yes
terday by. United States District Judge
de Haven, but Crittenden Thornton, his
attorney, made a motion in arrest of
judgment and ottered such substantial
reasons why. the motion should be granted
that the court deferred the passing of
sentence and took the motion under ad
visement until Monday. Before the mo
tion was made Assistant United States
Attorney Banning joined in the recom
mendation of the jury for clemency on
benaif of the accused.
Mr. Thornton's motion was based on
two grounds. First, that the indictment
\u25a0was insufficient because it contained Ini
tials and abbreviations 'of which no ex
planation had been made in the indict
ment, and second, that it had not been
alleged in the Indictment that Lieutenant
Colonel and Deputy Paymaster General
Coxe was authorized to sign the paper on
which his name was alleged to have been
forged by the defendant.

CAPTAIN MEAL
ASKS NEW TRIAL
STANFORD University and Reli
.ance Athletic Club football
elevens played a game yesterday
afternoon on the Sixteenth and
Folsom street grounds in -which
neither team scored. At no time was
either goal seriously menaced.
The game was slow and ragged, neither
eleven playing up to its usual form. The
conditions of the ground was blamed for
this. After every scrimmage clouds of
dust rolled up enveloping the players and
obscuring them from -the view of - the
spectators. The players on each side felt
its effect, as it choked them and seemed
to take all the steam and speed out of
them. Stanford's line seemed weak, the
Reliance men going through it like water
through a sieve.
One of the features of the game was
Frank Rodolph' s brilliant punting for Re
liance. He did not enter the game until
near its close, as Platt was being tried
out at quarter. When he was put in Re
liance had just secured the ball and it
was on the team's ten-yard line. Rodolph
punted, sending the ball down the field
sixty-five yards. There was an exchange
of mints at this juncture out of which
Reliance emerged with a gain of fifteen
yards. ,
Raitt, Stanford's quarterback, was ap
parently unable to judge the flight of the
ball throughout the game. He allowed
several punts go over his head, while
others fell short.
Reliance was penalized thirty yards in
all nearly in the game for off-side plays.
There was enough rough work to delight
a patron of boxing. Captain Fisher of
Stanford, Cooper and Dinsmore were all

SIH ALBERT S
WINS EASILY
Cadwalader kicked off thirty-eight yards
for Olympic. The ball was caught and
kicked back by More. More punted for
twenty-five yards, and Cutter punted the
ball back into California territory. Two
offside plays gave Berkeley twenty yards
hard fought from beginning to
end and furnished several incidents that
set the rooters wildly cheeringâ notably
when Overall tried to place a kick for
goal succeeded, and when Mini made
his remarkable end runs for California.
The weather was warm. Both halves
were short, the first twenty minuted and
the second fifteen minutes. Throughout
both the ball was in Olympic's territory
most of the time, and in the first half
practically all the time. The college elev
en has greatly improved since its game
last Saturday with Reliance. It failed,
however, at critical moments and its
playing throughout was uncertain. Con
centration of effort was lacking when
most needed. The clubmen put up a hard
game, but several times failed to make
necessary gains against their opponents.
Mini, the college left half, seldom failed
to work his distance. Two sensational
runs are credited to him. In the rirst half
he raced down the field for thirty-six
yards, and in the second half for forty
one yards. Gammon played well tor the
clubmen, and Cutter at full did good
punting.
CALIFORNIA won the football
game from the Olympic Club
eleven yesterday at Berkeley by
a score of 5 to 0. The game was
and Mini and Braley carried the ball into
the Olympic field for three yar'ds each.
After that the pigskin never crossed i.he
center. Whipple failed to gain and Cali
fornia punted for eighteen yards. Gam
mon made short gains for the .clubmen
and Cutter punted to center. Whipple and-s
Mini made short gains and More punted.
The ball was returned to center by Cut
ter. Mini carried it for thirty-six yards
toward the clubmen's goal, his interfer
ence working veil throughout the run.
Later Stow tried for -a twenty-yard place
\u25a0kick for goal and failed. The half ended
without score.
In the second half Overall kicked off.
The ball was returned and Overall punt
ed. Olympic 'failed to gain and punted to
Duden. Hudson. Berkeley's quarter, '
fumbled and Cadwalader fell on the ball.
Failing to gain. Cutter kicked. Berkeley
made short gains and then Mini made his
second sensational run, this time covering
forty-one yards. Olympic secured the ball
on a fumble and forced it to center. Over
all punted and California was penalized
thirty yards because "Womble tackled
Gammon before he caught the ball. Later
Mini made a sixteen-yard run and was
followed by Sherman for twenty-five
yards, but the ball was returned on ac
count of an offside play by Albertson. On
the Olympic thirty-yard line Overall tried
for a place kick. Morehead passed the
ball, Hudson placed it and Overall sent It
whizzing between the goal posts, al
though but a hand's breadth from one of
them. The whistle blew a few minutes
later.
The officials of the game were: L. P.
Prescott, umpire; Paul Snowden, referee;
John Hammersmith, timekeeper; "Woolsey
and Kohn, linemen.
Following is the line-up of the teams:
put out of the game for the too strenuous
methods they employed. Bert Oliver made
an ideal referee in the first half. He kept
the spectators informed as to the number
of "draws" and the number of yards gain
required each time.
Traegar, the hero of the last intercol
legiate game, attempted a field goal. His
aim was true, the ball sailing through the
air in a straight line toward the center
of the space between the goal posts.
There was hardly sufficient strength be
hind the kick which, coupled with the
.wind being against the ball, made it fall
short. It finally rested on Reliance ten
yard line, from which it was punted by
Rodolph.
When the game ended Relince had the
ball in the middle of the field. The teams
faced or.e another in the following order:
Reliance. Position. Stanford.
Dinsmore. ." L â E â R : Cooper
Collins L â T â R McFadden
Weirs Lâ Gâ R Barnhtsel
Fleck Center Hauverman

Plattâ Rodolph Quarter Raitt
Varney Lâ H Bâ R Fisherâ Smith

- The attendance was not large. This
was explained on the ground that both
teams were away from their home
grounds. The. Stanford rooters were as
sembled before play commenced in the
second half and the well-known "Rah!
Rah! Rah! Stanford!" rang out sharply on
the afternoon air as an encouragement to
the men In cardinal on the field.
Bert Oliver was referee and "Dave"
Brown umpire in the first half. In the
i second they changed positions.
California Defeats the Olympics by
a Score of 5 to 0.
In the Stanford-Reliance Contest
Neither Team Scores.
The strain of playing gilt edged base
ball for two consecutive days was too
much for Ewing's hasbe<3-up aggregation
of cripples. They collapsed yesterday,
losing to the men from the sunny souti
by a score of 13 to 2. In order to furnish
a little excitement in an otherwise list
less contest and incidently to keep the
spectators from growing weary, "Pop"
Hardie began putting the players out of
the game whenever they displayed a ten
dency to question his decisions. Monler
was the first to suffer, being put out the
first time he went to the bat. Hemphlll
and Dougherty were handed the sama
kind of a package soon after for no ap
parent reason. In Dougherty's case
Hardie's action was entirely unwarrant
ed The big right fielder was clearly saf 9
on first. Not hearing the decision he held
his base and when called out was re
moved from the game, simply because ha
said a few words, which he had a right
tO The real fun began in the third round.
Dougherty of Los Angeles led off with a.
hit. Householder was hit by a pitched
ball. Six more hits, coupled with a braeÂ©
of errors, netted nine runs before the
agony was over. One was also scored in
the second on Babbitt's error, which gave
the Angels a total of 10. After this
"Youngey" Johnson settled down and but
three runs and as many hits were mada
off him, the runs being the result of poof
fielding. The score:

RIGHT OF TRANSIT . .-
IN EXCLUSION ACT
Purpose of Declaring the
Law.
Judge de Haven Appealed To for the
Messrs. Webb and Foulds argued before
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday the matter of habeas corpus on
behalf of Fok Yung Yo, a Chinese laborer,
who came hither in transit for San Jose
de Guatemala. Customs Collector S' at
ton refused to allow him the privilege of
transit and the court was asked to inter
pose.
- The counsel argued that the privilege of
transit across this country was guaran
teed to Chinese laborers by thÂ° terms of
the treaty between the United States and
China under certain precautionary regu
lations to be adopted by the Government.
Their client came on the Nippon Maru
and asked permission to transfer to an
other vessel in-the bay of San Francisco
bound for San Jose de Guatemala, to
which place he had purchased a through
ticket in Hongkong. .
Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning contended that the court had no
jurisdiction on habeas corpus to review
the decision of the Collector of the Port,
and that the proper remedy under the ex
clusion act was by appeal, a right which
the petitioner had not exhausted.
Judge de Haven remarked as a matter
of fact that the authorities had no right
to deny a Chinese laborer Ihe right of
transit from China by way of San Fran
cisco to Mexico simply because they sus
pected that he might steal into the United
States from Mexico.' *r*
The question as to the court's jurisdic
tion was taken under advisement.'

A DETERMINED WOMAN.
Finally Found a Food That Cured Her
"When I first read of the remarkable ef-
fects of .Grape-Nuts food. I determined to
secure seme," says Mrs. C. W. Aldridge
of Salisbury, Mo. "At that time there was
none kept In this town, but my husband
ordered some from a Chicago traveler.
"I had been greatly afflicted with sud-
den attacks of cramps, nausea and vom-
iting. Tried all sorts of remedies and
physician?, but obtained only temporary
relief. As soon as I began to use the new
food the cramps disappeared and have
never reappeared.
"My old attacks of sick stomach were
a little Flower to yield, but by continuing
the food that trouble has disappeared en-
tirely. I am to-day perfectly well, can
eat anything: and everything I w^h, with-
out paying the penalty that I used to. We
could not. and would not., keep house
without Grai>e-NUt3.
"My husband was so delighted with the
benefits I received that he has been rec-
ommendJap Grar>e-Nuta to his customers
and has built up a very large trade on the
food. He fells them by the case to most
of the leading physicians of' the county,
who prescribe Grape-Nuts very generally.
There Is some satisfaction in usins: a
really scientifically prepared food." â¢ I

a F^ Allen Â» E - W..- Ferguson, E. E. Kahn
and George A. Newhall.
The commercial bodies adopting the
fcatmng resolutions in condemnation of
the Examiner previously alluded to rep
resent the entire vast commercial, indus
trial and shipping interests of this city
and port, together with the allied lumber
industry of the forest counties. In the
Merchants' Association are nearly all the
business houses of this city, wholesale
and retail. \u25a0 The Chamber of Commerce
represents, together with the Shipowners*
Association, the banks, the insurance
companies and the foreign and coastwise
commerce of the port. The Manufactur
ers and Producers' Association includes
the representatives of the factories and
also the larger capital invested in Cali
fornia agricultural and horticultural en
terprises. The Merchants' Exchange Is
the newly organized body, which Is on the
lines of the great exchanges of the com
mercial cities of the East, having for its
purpose the unification of the interests of
all the other exchanges in the city and
representing them all. The Produce Ex
change trades in agricultural products of
California. In the Board of Trade are all.
the wholesale houses of the city and also'
many of the larger retail houses. Collec
tively they represent about all the active
invested capital in San Francisco. .
Whereas, The dally Examiner of San Fran
cisco has, through its columns, for a long time
past been inciting class against class, thus
sowing seeds of discord among our people, tend
ing- eventually to create discontent, disorders,
riots and finally - leading to anarchism, all of
which are inimical to the best interests of
the State and nation; and
Whereas, The fomenting of such disorders
and strikes encourages the depraved and law
less, causing- anarchists to stop short of no
crime, even to the assassination of thÂ« Presi
dent ot the United. States; therefore be it
Resolved. By the Merchants' Exchange, that
It strongly condemns the attitude of the said
Examiner, and that the said newspaper be
henceforth excluded from Its flies and that
It will not give any information to the repre
sentatives thereof.
Following in the footsteps 'of the other
commercial bodies of this city, the Mer
chants' Exchange yesterday passed a reso
lution condemning the Examiner, order
ing it excluded from its flies and instruct
ing employes not to give that paper any
items of news. This action had been con
templated for the last week. On.Thurs
day last, when the directors of the ex
change met, the matter was discussed at
length. Action was deferred, however,
until yesterday, when the secretary was
ordered to see that the Examiner was not
k^Pt on file and that the representatives
Â°f that paper be given no news.
The resolution adopted is similar to
those passed by, the various commercial
bodies of San Francisco. It is as follows:
follows:
General Young issued a general order
for the department yesterday that all
subordinate posts should hold drills in
military signaling twice weekly. In for
eign, service,- particularly \u25a0 in the Philip
pines, it has. been found. that members of
the Signal Corps are', not numerous
enough to accompany all troops on minor
expeditions. Necessity for knowledge of
wig-wagging among the men and officers
often arises and the War Department
"has officially advised all department com
manders to order drills in the. rudiments
of signaling". ....".;,.â¢.-.,-\u25a0-\u25a0 -> â¢
\u25a0': General" Young directs that the practice
shall be maintained until every troop,
battery and company in his command
shall have,: one officer and at least four
enlisted men- proficient in that branch of
military science. \
The board is made up of four of the
leading engineering experts in the ser
vice of the United States. They are to
meet at Honolulu as soon as possible and
proceed with the work of Investigation.
Before their return to Washington they
will also be called upon to make an in
spection of Honolulu harbor. Several
months at least will elapse before a re
port will be returned. The personnel of
the board is William H. *Heuer and
Charles E. L, B. Davis, lieutenant colo
nels of the Corps of Engineers, Major
AVilliam E. Birkhimer and Captain Adam
Slaker of the Artillery Corps.
Simultaneously the Secretary of War
has appointed another board to meet at
Manila and report upon the subject of
the defense of the Important harbors In
the Philippines. With. the batteries that
have recently been established on Correg-
Idor Island and covering every inch of
the narrow channel by which ships enter
Manila harbor Southern Luzon is safe,
but Aparri, Vigan, Dagupan, Iba and
Olangapo have still to be fortified on the
principal island. On the other islands,
Iloilo, Panay and Zamboanga, Mindanao,
should according to the strategists be de
fended also.
The officers named to serve on this
board are Major Clinton B. Sears and
Captain Henry Jervey of the Corps of
Engineers and Captain Albert Todd and
Captain William S. McNair of the Artil
lery Corps. â¢ - .
News was received at army headquar
ters yesterday' that the Secretary of War
had appointed a board of officers to con
sider and report upon the feasibility of
the much-mooted project of fortifying
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
Since the acquirement of the Philip
pines the leading strategists of the coun
try have constantly been calling atten
tion to the need of a proper naval sta
tion : at some . point in the Hawaiian
Islands, which could be a place of ren
dezvous for fleets in case of war. Hono
lulu can easily be defended, but cannot
be made invulnerable. A thorough in
vestigation of the harbors of the different
islands in the group has disclosed the
fact that Pearl Harbor is possessed of
every advantage as a rallying point for
men-of-war and that with proper de
fenses it would practically be impossible
for a hostile fleet to force an entrance.
Pearl Harbor has, however, at its en
trance great reefs of coral which are a
serious menace to shipping and which
could be removed only at enormous cost.
On this account there has been consider
able debate in official circles as to the
practicability of the proposed improve
ments. The naval authorities have, how
ever, been almost unanimous in further
ing the scheme and should the report of
the recently appointed board be favorable
the necessary Government appropriation
will be made and Pearl Harbor will be,
with the possible exception of Hongkong,
the strongest strategic point in Pacific
waters.
Further Defense of Ports in
Philippines Is Con
sidered.

died a short time afterward. How Ling,
president of the Suey Don Tong, was sub
sequently arrested and charged with the
crime.
; Several months ago Kitt, who was a
cook, and two other Chinamen, named
Yee Chung and Yo Sing, were marked by
the Suey Don Tong and a price of J300
each was set on their heads. Chung, a
few days later, was found dead in Ross

charged for lack of evidence.

presiding Bishop of the Episcopal
church, who shall serve for three years,
will undoubtedly cause a prolonged
debate when it is referred back to the
house by the committee on constitution.
Interviews with some of the prominent
churchmen who are attending the con
vention show that there has been a grow
ing impression for some years that a
stronger and more inclusive oversight of
church. affairs and church discipline
should be had than, that which has ob
tained through the practice of making the
Bishop longest consecrated the presiding
Bishop of the church.
This, many are of the opinion, leaves too
much to the accident of age and places
the church in danger of having good men
in that exalted position whose advanced
years and delicate health prevented even
their attendance at the General
tion, to say nothing of the many extra

by Deputy Chase of Nebraska,

Bishop Dudley of Kentucky- is not only a man
in his i very- prime, but his location is such
that were he, for instance, to be made presid
ing Bishop of the ' church JÂ»e could reach out
duties that the exalted position involved.
Deputy Chase, when seen last evening,
dicussed the resolution he had ( presented
to the House cf Deputies. He said: - .
The accident of age carried with it the ac
cident of locality,- so that the presiding Bishop
of the church might be found resident In Flor
ida or Oregon, points remote from the .center
of church work and activity. It Is the opinion
of the men best informed in this convention,
with whom I have, discussed my resolution,
that the presiding Bishop should not only be
a man in the height of his bodily powers, but
one whose residence was in a diocese either
centrally located or , located near the seat of
the church's greatest point of influence, by
which, of course. Is understood the East. \u25a0 '
This last idea would find expression In the
manner in' which nearly all the church looks
upon certain Eastern .men as the ideal pri
mates. On the other hand, were less active or
aggressive men in these . Eastern sees the eye?
of Western men, . like myself.' would naturally
turn to our own section of the country.
In every direction where his attention was
called by the exigencies of discipline, manage
ment or spiritual oversight. He could be
promptly reached by mail and could personally
attend lunctions of importance. ,
LIMIT OF AGE IS NOT

Such a happy condition of affairs can only
be accomplished .>by making the office elective
This is the object of this resolution amending
the constitution, in which I have taken \u25a0 sug
gestions made on every side and put them into
a form that I trust will meet the approba
tion of a majority of both houses. There are
those who would favor an age limit instead of
an .annual election, the consensus of opinion
resting at the age of seventy, but a large
number fear that under such a law a presiding
Bishop might be had whose inability, to carry
on the office would be patent to all save him
self and the church stand still or suffer in
the Interim. '
To elect every three years, to a few minds,,
may take away- something from the dignity
of the office, but that it safeguards It is quite
fully agreed. \u25a0' -â¢ ': \u25a0 "

YESTERDAY morning's proceed- 1
ings of the House of Deputies of
the General Convention of the
Episcopal church produced a
flood of eloquence In the debates
â¢hat took place over proposed amend
ments to the constitution of the church.
Some of the most prominent clerical and
lay deputies delivered speeches for and
tgainst the proposition to allow Bishops
to exercise a spiritual watch over congre
gations that may not be in union withÂ»the
Eniscopal church.
The amendment was a section of one
that distinctly denned the Book of Com
mon Prayer, the form and manner of or
dtining and consecrating Bishops, priests
ur.d deacons and the entire ritual to be
used by- the church on all occasions. Some .
<>f the speakers were in favor of enlarg-
1 '.g the scope of the Bishops, while others
fetrongly opposed the proposition, their
% r iews being directed at the ritualistic or
"higV* church element. The debate will
be ontlnued to-morrow morning, when
the House of Deputies will resume Its ses
sion. . â¢
Committees were appointed by the
House of Bishops and the House of Depu
ties to confer on the selection of the next
place of convention. A resolution., was
presented providing for the election of the
Presiding Bishop for a term of three
years, doing away with the present sys
tem of the Senior Bishop by order of con
secration presiding over the church.
The resolution was referred to a com
mittee and will be debated at length when
it is reported to the house. The House of
Bishops held a brief morning session, but
nothing of importance was reported as
haying been accomplished.
The House of Bishops convened again
In the afternoon and deliberated over sev
eral important matters. When the prel
ates finished their labors It was decided
to establish two new missionary 'districts
In the territories of the United States, one
for Porto Rico and the other for Vieque.

Is Favored by Many of the Delegates.

Rev. Dr. Ashton of FlOrfda presented a
resolution providing for the omission of

Continuing, Deputy Chase said:
Deputy Chase of Nebraska then pre
sented the following important resolution
relating to the election : of a presiding
Bishop:
Resolved. That section 3 of article 1 of the
constitution be amended to read as follows:
3. The presiding Bishop of, the church shall
discharge such duties as may be prescribed by
the constitution and the canons of the Gen
eral conventions. He shall be nominated to
the House of Deputies by the House of Bishops,
from one of their number having jurisdiction
within the United States, and upon approval
by the House of Deputies he shall become and
remain the presiding Bishop of the church for
the term- of three years and until the next
session of the General Convention, when his
successor shall be elected in the same manner.

THE HOUSE AMENDS
THE CONSTITUTION"
The amendments to the constitution
then became the order of the day and
Rev. Dr. Egar of New York presided over
the debate.
Dr. Egar moved that article 7 of thÂ©
constitution be stricken out and that the
following: article be inserted In Its place:
No person shall be ordered priest or deacon
until he shall have been examined by the
Bishop and two priests and shall have ex
hibited such testimonials and other requisites
es the canons in that case provided may di
rect. No person shall be ordained and conse
crated Bishop, or ordered priest or deacon, un
less at the time, in the presence of the ordain,
ing Bishop or Bishops, he shall subscribe and
make the following declaration:
-I do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old
and New Testaments to be the word of God,
and to aontaln all things necessary to salva
tion; and I do solemnly engage to conform to
the doctrine, discipline and worship of th?
Protestant Episcopal church In the United
States of America."
No person ordained by a foreign Bishop, or
by * a Bishop not in communion with this
church, shall be permitted to officiate as a
minister of this church until he shall havÂ»
complied with the canon or canons In that
case provided and also shall have subscribed
the aforesaid declaration.
A short debate followed on the proposed
amendment, which was carried when tha
roll was called. Amendment 11 to the,
constitution was. then presented by Dr.
Egar and adopted by a unanimous vote.
The amendment takes the place of article
VI in the constitution and is as follows:
The General Convention may. by canon, es
tablish a court for the trial of Bishops, which
shall be composed of Bishops only.
Presbyters and deacons shall be tried by a
court instituted by the convention of the dio
cese, or by the, ecclesiastical authority of the
missionary district in which they are canon
ically resident.
The Genera! Convention, In like manner, may
establish or may provide for the establishment
of courts of review of the determinations of
diocesan or other trial courts.
The court for the review of the determination
of the trial court, on the trial of a Bishop,
hhall be composed of Bishops only. '. \
; The General Convention, in like manner, may
fstablish an ultimate court of appeal, solely
i for the review of the determination of any
] court of review on questions of doctrine, faitti
| or worship.
I None but a Bishop shall pronounce sentence
of admonition, or of suspension, deposition or
degradation from the ministry, on any Bishop,
presbyter or deacon.
A sentence of suspension shall specify on
what terms or conditions and at what time
the suspension shall cease.
The principal change provided by the
above amendment is that it creates courts
of appeal and review, similar to the ec
clesiastical courts of the established
Church of England.
The presentation cf article XI as an
amendment to the constitution in place
of the present article' VIII gave rise to
the first prolonged debate of the conven
tion proceedings.
The article was divided into two Â»ec-

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1901.It is very likely that separate Bishops
wiil be elected for each of these districts.
Massachusetts wJJl be divided into two
dioceses. A line will be drawn on the east
side of Worcester County, excepting the
town of Southborounh, and thus two dio
ceses made "where but one existed before
this convention. Boston, a part of the old
diocese, raised $100,000 for the new.
It was also agreed to change the djo
cese of Indiana, which is now the south
ern part of the State, to Indianapolis. .-,
A. committee was appointed to take in
the whole subject of candidates tor the
ministry. On the committee are the Bish
ops of Dallas, Southern Virginia, Tennes
see, Massachusetts and the coadjutor of
Southern Ohio.
The Bishops, will resume their session
to-morrow morning. On Tuesday the up

MANY INIfOOtIT SUBJECTS,
Rev. Dr. McKimm moved that the de
bate go over until Monday morning. The
motion was carried and the house ad
journed until to-morrow morning.
Deputy Stetson of New York moved
that the session be extended until 2 p. m.,
which was defeated.
Rev. Mr. Egar moved that the vole on
this question be taken in ten mirtutes, and
that. those ten minutes be siven to the
Rev. Mr. Huntington to close the debate.
The motion of Dr. Egar was put to a vote
and lost.
We do not need it, because the Bishops have
that power. Then why not take this provision
of the'coiiEtJt^tion and amend it and make it
safe and Found? If the deputies will turn to
the journr.l of 13*8 they will see that the Rev.
Dr. Huntington offered a very earefully drawn
cmendment -to the constitution. K vÂ« are
going to adopt such .in amendment lot us hive

acted upon in ten minutes, as in the conven

who explained somewhat to me. to my great
benefit, the condition of his diocese. lie said.
I think, that 75 per cent of them were for
eigners, and that it was utterly impossible
for him to keep them under his spiritual direc
tion Â« he were to enforce the Book of Com
mon Prayer in all its' particulars.
He cited a French conpresatlon where he
told me he did not pretend to have common
prayer, but only, in its essentials. And he
went on to speak of the SwedUh people, the
Lutherans, for all of whom he hÂ«.d to make
such provision es this candh would call for
Whether that will help the provision or not,
for which I mean to vote, I. do not know. I
thank the deputy from New York for assuring
this convention that there are Cishops acting
without this provision of tlie constitution
which answers the r>oint that we do not need
it. which has been made several tiaifts this
morning and which I made In 18-S.
iir. Saunders of Massachusetts revived
the question as to whether the word "ca
non" in the proposed amendment meant
a i anon of the general church, and dis
cussed the question at some length. He
was followed by Rev. D.r. Parks of New
York, who said:
GIVES THE VIEWS OF
RITUALISTIC BISHOP
done in various parts of the world by either
our own church or the Church of England.
Judge Stephens of Minnesota expressed
his views on the proposed amendment as
follows: *
It will be perceived that the first article of
paragraph 10 as adopted to-day differs radl-'
caily from the first article of the constitution
as it existed heretofore in this respect. The
provision now is this: "The book of common
prayer," etc.. "shall be in use in all the dio
ceses and missionary districts of this church."
In other words, no BUhop, no priest, no deacon
in any diocese or missionary district of this
church may use anythlns but the prayer book.
Voices: "No. no, no. "'
Judge Stephens expressed his views on
the question as follows:
I submit to your own construction of the
English language, and to my legal brethren,
as to -whether a change in the constitution Is
significant or not. That language is significant, \u25a0
which Eays that It shall be In use. It either
means that it shall be. in general use, or it
shall be used occasionally, or it shall be used
universally. I submit that the fair construc
tion of it is that It shall be In general use..,
I have the honor to represent. In a very
humble capacity, in part, the diocese which
was also represented by the gentleman who
proposed this amendment In the late conven-
. It has been stated, and I believe it thor
oughly, thatany "Bishop 1ti this chnrch has a
perfect right when a number of people In any
little village eay to him, "We are not ready
to use the prayer book, we are not ready to be
confirmed, we are not ready to receive the
holy communion .accordinc to your order, but
for some reason we would like to look up to
you as our spiritual father, we would like to
have you take a certain guidance of our devo
tions, we would like to have you send us a
little manual for our public worship, suitable
to our conditions and our needs," why that
Bishop can do it, and as a matter of course
he will.
MINNESOTA JUDGE IN
FAVOR OF EXTENSION
I find myself in sympathy with pretty much
everything' that has been said on bath sides
of this question; that is to say, I think we all
want to maintain the conservative character
of the -church, and I think we all want to show
any people outside of the church who desire
what the church can give them, that we will
give them what they desire. But the admirable
exposition of the deputy from Rhode Island
left me asking the question, which I will at
tempt to make some answer to. What Is the
use of it?
advantage In tills country chiefly because of
its conservatism, and our church. If it only
can realize the situation, will stand upon that
basis upon which it has always stood from
the beginning of its history as a national
church. The church in the" United States of
America to-day Is sought by large numbers of
people but so far as I know it Is not sought
by anv considerable number of people in the
way proposed.
If you will look back into the history of the
church you will discover that people have found
the Episcopate from the Prayer Book and not
the Prayer Book from the Episcopate. And
when we are confronted as we are to-day with
instability and when the spirit of change gets
Into the church Itself It is well for us to
pause and consider whether we are doing well
to admit into the constitution of the church
such a provision as this which is proposed
by the reverend deputy from New York and
amended by one who has departed, from this
world. The church In the United States has
a unique opportunity and ousht not to deal
with questions purely upon an academic basis.
I do not believe' for a moment that the reverend
deputy from New York would Introduce any
question into this houte for the sake of change.
I deeply regret that the spirit of change
should take hold upon the minds of the Bishops
and priests of the church, and that the great
conservative and sound body of th<Â» laity should
be included In this spirit of change. I trust
that until we are confronted with some greater
necessity than we are to-day we shall not vote
for the passage of this airier.dment. .
Regarding the proposed amendments
Rev. Dr. Mann of West Virginia said:
But the prayer book and the canons are quite
sufficient as they are, and there is plenty of
flexibility, and we need nothing more. In the
Church of England there is no cry for in
creased facilities In missionary work, and the
Church of England is more ironbound than
we are in the use 'of Its prayer book. It Is
not found that the â¢ prayer book has been a
hindrance to the great \u25a0 work which has been
Rev. Rr. Carey was followed by Rev.
Dr. Oberly of New Jersey, who said' In
part:
The .passage of this amendment to the con
stitution seems entirely unnecessary so far as
.missionary work is concerned.' AVe have all
the liberty and all the flexibility provided at
present which is necessary for missionary
work. . I speak not theoretically, because 1
have had the opportunity of putting it into
practice myself, with the consent of more than
one Bishop under whom I have served. It Is
undoubtedly true that there are people to be
brought into .the church who are not acquaint
ed with the prayer book, with Its \u25a0 rubrics, or
who are prepared to use it. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0>â¢ . "\u25a0
It seems to me that, on true principles of
the Holy Catholic Churchâ Catholic means uni
versalâthat we are to bring Into our borders,
by any lawful means within our power, all the
nations of the earth. â¢ !
NEW JERSEY DEPUTY
AGAINST THE ARTICLE
To-day you will find in the Orient one Ufe<l
In the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and you
will find another u. c ed in the Patriarchate to
Constantinople, another in Kgypt In the -Cop
tic church; and yet thi?y arc all bound together
by one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one Gcwl
and Father.. So, in the church in the e.irly
stages, through tho Anglo-Saxon period, too,
there was great variety, and you know that
there was no conformity to one use until after
tho Norman conquest.
I should be very sorry, 'sir, to have this,
amendment, this addition, fail. We are looking
over the mere technicalities of the question.
Wo believe that we are a church authorized,
appointed and sent forth by our. Divine Lord,
to go into all the world, and to bring in all
nations. Let us for a moment look at this
matter and see . whether it is dangerous,
whether we have any precedents. What Is the
proposition?*
It ia proiibsed that while people. who % may
wish to come within our borders and become
loyal sons of the church are In process of
education, it is proposed to give them a serv
ice which will lead them up to the mountain
tops, so they will have the greater outlook
when they are educated, and have full bene
fits of those who have been born and rtared
in the church, and who are devotc-d to our
grand old liturgy and prayer book. For a mo
ment, brethren, consider that It was the cus
tom of the church In the earliest ages to. havu
variety. Why, wo have four gospels. We
had In the early church as many as fifty dif
ferent liturgies, wliich were used among tho
different nations.
Rev. Dr. Carey of Albany made a strong
plea In favor of the amendment. In part
he said:
tion. Dr. Prouty. Wejiave conferred with him
upon this subject, and I believe I speak his
sentiments when I say that the Minnesotar
diocese, bs we know it, has 300,000 Scandi
navians who ' are reaching forward to the
church, -whose mission, as I_ understand, is not
to keep up the bars nor to close doors, but to
go out Into all the world, and I say if you
are wllllnp to encourage those to come into
the church you will adopt this amendment to
tho constitution.
What is Its purpose? Why, here Is the old
father and the old mother who understand
their vernacular, they are deeply attached to
it, and yet they are willing to go under the
supervision of a Bishop,^ and here are their
children coming to manhood and womanhood
who will come Into full communion with the
church.. I trust you will adept that amend
ment.

admirable sense of Justice the purport of
the amendment
LAY DEPUTY OPPOSES
POWES OF BISHOPS
Mr. Parker of Colorado next took up
the debate. In part he said:
I hardly wish to go Into any ornate sen
tences, as Dr. Huntington expressed It a few
moments ago, but I do feel as a layman that
this strikes Intrinsically at matters pertain
ing to the church which, as a ' layman, and
looking at the church as we should look at it,
I feel intensely about. The question, to my
mind. Is this: Are we to allow Bishops to have
such tremendous power?
If the Bishop of Fond du Lac can bave tre
mendous power in one direction and the Bishop
in another diocese can have power in another
direction, we are throwing aside the solidarity
of the church itself and giving a certain
amount of papacy to each diocese. I cannot
submit that to any Bishop, although It may
seem presumptuous in a layman to say so,
Again, as I look at the church, I turn to it
as my mother to teach me, and that I may
teach certain lessons to my children, and bring
them up in the fear and nurture and admon
ition of the Ix>rd, I do not ask that these, chil
dren Khali be allowed all kinds of doctrines.
Rev. Dr. Alsop of Long Island next
fpoke as follows:
Those of us who have had the privilege of
being members of several of the late conven
tions realize that this question has been very
thoroughly discussed in every possible light.
I imagine that it would be impossible to eug*
ge*t an objection 'which has not been made and
which hss not been more or less directly met.
The objection that was made and that pre
vailed at one convention was that the Bishops
could not possibly be trusted. We pride our
selves upon being an Episcopal church. We
iancy that the Biehops have wisdom, that they
have sincerity, that they are desirous
of the prosperity of the church and the win
ning of sculs to the head of the church; and
yet to every amendment and proposition of this
sort that is made it is objected that the Bishops
would probably allow some extreme and as
tounding i-.Gsition to be taken: that we should
have, on the one hand, the Iloman mass al
lowed, practically, or that we should have
some form of service that was too nearly al
lied to that of non-Epiecopal bodies. That ob
jection. 1 think, weighed so heavily with one
convention that by a very close vote the prin
ciple of thif> amendment was defeated. At the
last convention, however, a gentleman, who for
one or two conventions had been almcet the
chief antagonist of the measure, feeling the
force of the objections that then; were thoee
who feared that ths Bishops could not bÂ«
trusted, devised cleverly \u25a0 a means by which
that objection should be entirely obviated, so
that the whole power in the matter should
not be left to the Bishops, but that the Gen
eral Convention should have its say and should
1n that way prevent any extreme position be
ing taken.
The Rev. Dr. Proudy, therefore, brought in
the amendment that a canon should be neces
sary to prescribe what liberty should be al
lowed. It was feit by the last convention that
that amendment so thoroughly met the objec
tion that with a vote overwhelmingly strong
this article was adopted as a part of the con
stitution. It seems to me, therefore, that we
are largely likely to go on threshing old straw,
and for my part I only wish that every new
member of this house had been present at the
two conventions before, so that they might have
heard vliat was to be paid and have had a
chance to voice their opinions. '\u25a0
Regarding this question Rev. Mr. Tay
lor of Los Angeles said:
As a member ' of the House - of Deputies,
which met three years ago In the city of Wash
ington. I had the great pleasure of voting for
this resolution, . and I believ* that it is in ac
cordance with the moving spirit of the church
that the Bishops should be given some liberty
and some privilege of bringing into the church
those whom they can possibly touch and lay
their hands upon.
I am not in favor of throwing away tho
gates and lowering the bars of the church
in order that sheep may stray away from us,
but I am heartily in favor of lowering the
bars and opening the gates that sheep may
come in to us. And I firmly believe that if
a Bishop at an extreme end of the church,
holding extreme doctrines, and another Bishop
at another extreme end of the church, hold-
Ing entirely different views of churchmanship,
should in their own way. and in their own
manner, and according to their own device,
be able to bring men into conformity with the
church and with the Â»aciaments of the church,
I should say, God speed them, and let them
do all they can to bring such persons into
the church.
JUDGE STINESS MAKES
. FAVORABLE ARGUMENT
Judge Stiness of Rhode Island next ad
dressed the house, saying:
It seems to me that the elements of this
proposed amendment are so simple and so
plain that there ought not to be any division
of opinion about them. The first of those ele
ments is that you have a congregation nnt In
union with this church; it Is a body outside of
it; secondly, that body denires to put Itself
under the spiritual oversight of a Bishop.
Can we have any objection to it? Is that let
ting- down the bars of the church In any way?
They say we are not churchmen, we have not
bÂ«n accustomed to your forms cf worship; we
desire your spiritual oversight and guidance,
but for temporary use we ask for some liberty,
according to the needs and "the understanding
of this congregation as it now Is.
What is the harm in that? How can there
be any difficulty in that, moreover, when you
are providing that any Bishop may take that
oversight subject to the provisions of a canon
which you shall adopt, setting forth all thÂ«
safeguards that you consider to be necessary?
I am as strict as my brother from Colorado
as to the doctrines that should be taught to
our children, and that none outside of the
church should be taught them. But how are
they to be taught those doctrines? He says
they "may not be satisfied with some of our
congregations'; they go to these outsiders as
though they were authorized; at once they go
to a- congregation not in union with this
church, they excommunicate themselves, and
if they have any such opportunity they can
Just as easily do it now ns they can after you
have got this canon. They are not letting
down the bars. It seems to me to be the
most conservative and at the same time the
most conciliatory legislation that this church
could porsibly put forth upon this subject.
DR. OLMSTEAD REGRETS
A SPIRIT OF CHANGE
Rev. Dr. Olmstead of Pennsylvania took
the floor at this point in the debate. In
part he said:
Our church has gained its present position of
tlons, the first of which was adopted with
, but little debate. The first section adopt
ed was as follows:
The Book of Common Prayer and administra
tion of the sacraments and other rites and cere
monies of the church, together with the Pealter
cr Psalms of David, the form and manner of
xnakine, ordaining and consecrating bishops,
pries ts and deacons, the form of consecration of
a church or chapel, the office of institution of
ministers, and articles of religion, as now es
tablished or hereaiter amended by the author
ity of this church, shall be in use in all the
dioceses and missionary districts of this church.
2v'o alteration thereof or addition thereto shall
be made unless the same shall be first proposed
in one triennial meeting of the general con
vention, and by a resolve thereof be sent within
clx months to the secretary of the convention of
every fliocese, to be made known to the dio
cesan convention at its next meeting, and be
edopted by the general convention at its next
succeeding triennial meeting by a majority of
the. whole number or bishops entitled to vote
in the House of Bishops, and by a majority
of the clerical and lay deputies of all the dlo
ceees entitled to representation in the House
-of Deputies voting by orders. Provided, how
ever, that the general convention at any meet
ing ehali have power to amend the tables of
lessons by a majority of the whole number of
bishops entitled to vote in the House of BUhops,
and by a majority of the clerical and lay dep
uties of til the dioceses entitled to representa
tion in the House of Deputies voting by orders.
The second section of article X, which
trovoked a long debate, which was still
in progress when the house adjourned,
follows:
But provision may be made by canon for the
temporary use of other forms and directories
cf worship by congregations not in union with
this church who are willUis to accept the spirit
ual oversight of the Bishop of the diocese or
missionary district.
An attempt to postpone any discussion
'on the second section of the amendment
"was defeated and Rev. Dr. Egar of Xew
"York was called upon to explain the sec
tion. In Dart he eaid:
In our vast country where there are about
70.000,000 of people. 65,000,000 of whom at least
are not familiar with the use of the Book of
Common Prayer, there must be many persons.
and there are many, I understand, who are
met with in missionary work, who are not.
fit for the use of the Hook of Common .Prayer.
I am trying to give you my understanding of
the purpose of this resolution as it was framed
t>y the movers. I think that they 'have th?
idea that it is going to be an almost hopeless
task to set our selves to convert these 70.
009,000 of people of the L'nited States to tho
use of the Book of Common Prayer as we are
used to it.
And, therefore, if we could get numbers of
people to accept the spiritual oversight and
advice of the Bishops themselves, we can trust
the Bishop of the diocere to give them a. form
and directory of worship which shall not be. so
far away in doctrine at least from the worship
of the prayer book that any reasonable person
would, not permit it in such cases.
Provision Is made by canon for the tem
porary use, until the congregation is edu
cated, little by little, of other forms and di
rectories o* worship, which, of course, would
be under the Juagment of the Bishop, and
\u25a0under the responsibility of the episcopate, by
congregations not in union with this church,
Trho cannot be in union because they are com
posed, perhaps, entirely of unbaptized people,
but who are nevertheless willing to put them
selves under the rpiritual oversight of the
Bishop of the diocese or mirsionary district.
It may very naturally be asEumed by
some that there will be no such congregations,
and it may be assumed by others that there
may be such congregations, and for that reason
I think it is at least permissible for the con
vention to express Its will with respect to this
provision.
KEV. DB. HXnsrTmGrTON'
STARTS DISCUSSION
In the debate that followed on the arti
cle the Rev. Dr. Huntington of New York
EaJd:
So far as I am concerned, and although I
have had no conference with any of my as
sociates in forming "th'.s* measure on the point.
I think I may speak also for them, we should
be perfectly willinie, after the succinct state
ment of the purport of this amendment by tho
clerical deputy from Central New York who.
\u25a0with such clearness and justice, has etated to
this house the purport of every amendment
that has thut far come before us. to come lit
once to a vote upon the amendment- There
eeems to be an impreeeion about that some of
the members of this houfe are burning with
a desire to oveiflow the house with oratory on
this subject. I believe t'.at to be a false im
pression and an erroneous rumor. We have
not speeches that have beon laid up In laven
der for three years which we have brought
ever from the But; not at all. Uut if there
1b to be discu&Fion we would like it to be a
full discussion, that both sides may be fairly
represented, and that there may be no artifi
cial check put upon the debate. Therefore,
vhile I sm perfectly wiilingr to go on with
the delrate, and wteh to h.ive the privilege of
closing it, yet if this house is so minded, I
tm entirely willing, and I am sure my friends
are â and I hope they are the great majority of
the houpe, judging by the vote on this question
three years agoâ to zo at once to a decisive
\u25a0viote.
Rev. I>r. Hopkins of Chicago followed
Eev. Dr. Huntineton. He said:
I cannot believe, elr. that this house is ready
to come to a precipitate vote upon this most
Important, most radical, and most unusual leg
islation. I ask the attention of the house to
the proposed amtndmtnt: "Provision may be
made by canon." By whose canon?
The speaker was about to propose an
amendment to cover this objection, but
â¢was reminded that amendments were not
in order. He- then proceeded:
The canon of this convention, the canon of
some possible provincial portion of this church.
or the canon of come individual diocese? I
allso call attention to a vital lapse In the.
\u25a0wording of. this proposed smendment. It docs
not propose any safeguard that such canonical
legislation may not concern the sacraments of
this church.
I sincerely hope that no addition to the arti
cle will bo tolerated by tals house that will
ih the least degree make it possible by a canon
of this convention which may be changed at
any session of any meeting- of tie convention,
or for -the . undesignated canon of any diocese
in the convention, to allow any office of wor
ehip In \his church which may possibly include
the Roman mass or some denominational serv
ice, la our communion.

of California, Delivers an Able Sermon
to the Visiting Ladies.
THE ninth convention of the
Daughters of the King opened
yesterday morning In St. Luke's
Church. Members of the organ-
lzation crowded the sacred edi
fice and listened to a sermon by the Right
Rev. William Ford Nichols, D.D., Bishop
of California. Holy- communion was cele
brated by the distinguished prelate, who
was assisted by the Rev, Mr. Weeden.
The choir, composed of fair singers, ren
dered a number of beautiful hymns.
BISHOP NICHOLS
DELIVERS SEBMON
The Bishop's sermon was a description
of the Lord's Prayer, and he took for* hU
text "The Power and Glory of the King
dom." Bishop Nichols discussed tne
grayer by phrases and dwelt on the
eauty and significance of the words and
the lesson they taught. In part ho said:
One of the simple laws of our Prayer Book
Mission is that of penitence preceding praise.
It Is founded upon a natural Instinct of the
heart. ' When anything comes between the chiid
and the mother there is Borrow until there is
forgiveness, but whenever anything coroej be
tween God and ourselves there is no psac-a
until our sins have been forgiven. This is very
significantly broucht out in the Use of the
Lord's Prayer in this otlice that we have en
tered upon. We use that prayer twice, once
at the very beginning and at the end.
When you gather to your convention and
bring to it enthusiasm, hopes for the church
and the high and more extended development
of the Order of the Daughters of the King,
you come with the proper spirit. Christ lie-*
back of your organizationâ he's back of all
your chapter's interests and all that you hope
and do. It Is that unshakable voice that
finds a soul, which is the voice of Christ, which
finds its utterances !n praise.
Let then this description or the Lord's Prayer
be a lexson and comfort to you. I speak' tut
the noble Oaughters of the Kins of California
this morning. In voicing irom this place that
which you have already voiced in so many ways
by the kindly handclasp of the first meeting,
I speak to you to-day and welcome you to
California. We have prayed for yÂ«ur cominK-
We have felt that the inspiration would bÂ«
comforting tÂ» us. It has brought friend to
friend and its individual associations, which
I am sure cur daughters will never forget.
We welcome you to friendship every one to
every one. We welcome you to such hospitality
that we are ab'e to offer and it in hoped by
our local committee that you may be a.ble to
Join in BOine of the provisions. The general
reception will be held next Wednesday even
ing and thouzh circumstances may make it
necessary for some of you to withdraw, some
will remain and I hope will take a trip around
ths bay, which event will be announced later
on. And so we hope that San Francisco may
be able to have the privilege of extending to
you the hospitality as in your way you are
able to accent. .
We welcome you as friends; we welcome you
as Daughters of the King. We welcomÂ« you In
that fellowship \n which the Kingdom of Christ
Is with us.

TACOMA. Oct. 5.â That Dawson is once
more on the eve of an epidemic of small
pox, such as that which ravaged the com
munity a year ago, seems probable. By
prompt measures and with commendable
energy the authorities have taken charge
of seven men and confined them in a tem
porary hospital at the mouth of Bonanza
Creek. At first but one case was . well
developed, the others having .been seri
ously exposed to Infection from him in
a trip down the river in a scow. Since
then six others have been attacked by
well marked svmptoms and is no
question that they have smallpox..
,. When the first case waa reported to the
authorities it was considered unwise to
alarm the public, as hopes were high that
the disease could be stamped out with but
a single case. As the others came down
publicity became inevitable, resulting in
a general scare.

BARCELONA, Oct. 5.â Reports received

are nearly completed. They have ac
cumulated through smugglers 20,000 rifles
and uniforms have been made at Per
pignan, France, and brought into.Spain
at different places. Large supplfcs of
ammunition have been obtained from
Cuba and the Philippine Islands. The ris

Preparations Said to Be
Complete for an
Uprising.
. The output of the San Quentin jute
mills is limited, which made it necessary
to place a limit of 2000 upon the number
of sacks any farmer might procure.
Agefcts oi farmers in this county tried
to get bags from San Quentin early in the
season, but were unable to do so, being
informed that the output had been ex
hausted. They were somewhat surprised
to learn upon communicating- with San
Francisco dealers that San Quentin bags
could be procured in San Francisco in
50,000 lots, delivered on the steamers at
once.
**I am able to say to you now, after the
investigation of the alleged sack frauds,
that the Grand Jury of this county has
found that as far as this "county is con
cerned everything is as straight as a
string," said Mr. Ashley. "The greatest
orders came from Tulare, Salinas, Mon
terey, San Francisco and San Luis Obispo
counties, one firm alone in the latter
county procuring 1,000,000 sacks. It would
require oOO farmers to make affidavits for
that number of sacks. On the face of it
there evidently has been perjury commit
ted. It is probable that I will call the at
tention of the District Attorneys of the
counties mentioned to the facts in the
matter."
STOCKTON, Oct. 5.â As a result of the
Investigation made by the Grand Jury of
San Joaquin County, it has been devel
oped that no sacks for grain have
been obtained in this county from I San
Quentin by fraud. District Attorney Ash
ley of this county, who went over the
books of San Quentin Prison, has ob
tained facts and figures, however, indi
cating that grain sacks have been fraud
ulently procured from San Quentin in
Tulare, Salinas, San Luis Obispo, Mon r
terey and San Francisco counties.

HOTJT AIXEGED ANARCHISTS
WITH A VOIXEY OT EGGS
The Pacirlc Mail Company has so far
given employment to no union longshore
men, but if the work of the present week
should be heavier than the regular non
union force can handle, a number of the
men that have been out on strike will be
engaged.
Very few union firemen have gone to
work since the strike. In spite of the rat
ification of the Â«trike settlement by the
union the marine firemen are not satisfied
with present conditions.
The strike detail of police yesterday per
formed its last day of strike duty, and
to-day the peace of the wharves will be
looked after by Captain Dunleavy's regu
lar scuad.
The "straw bosses," or foremen, on all
the principal docks will -hereafter be non
union men. Each of the big steamship
lines will select men specially adapted for
this work and without union affiliations.
In this way the companies will be sure of
at least the framework of a working gang
the undivided allegiance of which can bÂ«
depended upon.
The water front looked more like Itself
yesterday than it has for a good many
weeks. Although for the latter part of the
strike period the loading and discharging
of ships was going along pretty much on
schedule time, the streets were used ex
clusively for business purposes and their
use both by pedestrians and conveyances
was limited to actual necessity. The
water front yesterday looked more like a
section of a city in a free country than it
has since the beginning of the strike. Un
guarded wagons and trucks carried an
almost unbroken procession of merchan
dise in both directions along the 'line of
docks. Pedestrians went about their busi
ness with an air of freedom, the regular
throng of Saturday afternoon sightseers
was in evidence and the army of non
union men enlisted during the strike was
out for an airing.
The sailors are gradually getting to
work again, and yesterd.ay there were
more longshoremen employed. Among
the latter, however, there is still a feeling
of dissatisfaction. Fifteen union men en
gaged to load the British ship John Cooke
at Main street refused to work if the
services of a non-union hoisting engineer
were retained. The attempt of the long
shoremen to dictate was fruitless, how
ever. They were promptly discharged and
the work continued by the crew of the
ship. The stevedores working on coal
snips also have a grievance. Instead of
receiving 55 cents an hour and $1 an hour
overtime their pay has been cut to 50
cents and 75 cents overtime. This cut is
not universal, but will probably rule all
along the front in a few days. Many
union men have refused to work for this
pay, but as there is now quite a rorce oi
non-uÂ«rion labor their refusal will cause
but little Inconvenience.

Every effort Is being made by the ladies*
of the San Francisco Red Cross Society
to continue the noble work done by them
during the late war. An annual meeting
was held yesterday afternoon at Century
Hall, on Sutter street, and was largely at-,
tended. Mrs. John F. Merrill presided,
and officers and chairmen of committees
presented reports.
Mrs. Merrill's report was a brief review
of the work accomplished during the year,
and gave praise to all who assisted her.
An appeal was made for more books, both
for the hospital library at the Presidio
and that In Manila. Mrs. I. Lowenberg}
supplemented this report \u25a0with, an Inter
esting account of the arrangements madai
for the Manila library.
The report of the treasurer showed thai
the receipts for the year were $2S7d 99
from all sources, and the expenditures
$2755 03, leaving a balance of $124 96. TheÂ»
reports of the secretary and other of-*
ficers and heads of committees treated
of the work done in detail. Mrs. W. B.

men are apparently reconciled to further
idleness for a part of them.
Manager George Renner of the Dray
men's Association said yesterday that by
to-morrow the draymen would be running
every wheel again. A large number of
horses were brought in from pasture yes
terday, and more will arrive to-day, and
as fast as possible they will be shod and
.made ready for \u25a0work. Some of the dray
men have had horses out to pasture along
the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers,
and now there is such a rush In the ship
ment of grain that the river "joats will
carry only a few horses at a time, and
the draymen will have much trouble In
getting their teams back in harness again.
While he thinks that teaming will be at
full blast to-morrow. Manager Renner es
timates the number of union teamsters
who will be driving at not more than
1000. but additions will be made to their
ranks day by day. A larger part of the
sand teamsters, fruit teamsters and coal
teamsters are already, handling the reins
again.
SPAIN FEARS
THE CARLISTS
"General -Miles seemed to be pleased !
with the notoriety which his startling
statement before the commission and his
subsequent newspaper interviews gave i
him; for again, on the 31st of March, I
1899, in New York City, he published. !
through representatives of the Associated
Press, and of a metropolitan paper, addi- ;
tional charges. !
"This unmilitary and questionable
method of making in public grave and
scandalous charges regarding a brother
officer and the work of his department
charges which subsequent and careful in- '
vestigation proved both unwarranted and
untrueâ seemed to appeal to certain char
acteristics- of the major general command
ing to which reference would be out of
place. j
"If we are to believe written evidence^
to the contrary, it doe3 not appear that
General Miles was even honest in making j
his dilatory charges that the tinned beef i
was issued as the 'pretense of an expert- '
ment,' and it waa now a part of the
ration. On the 17th of June, 1S98, his most ,
confidential staff officer signed a letter
by 'direction of the major general com
manding the army' instructing the depot
commissary at Tampa to furnish to Gen
eral Nunez 10,644 pounds of canned roast
beef, to be issued from the 'subsistence
stores of the army.' If we are to accept
the reading of\this letter as correct, it
proves that General Miles knew that
canned fresh beef was, a part of the ra
tion;'that he knew there was a large
quantity of it at Tampa for issue to the
troops, and that he so far approved of its
use as to direct that the ration be fur
nished'in large quantities to our allies."

"On the 21st of December," continues
General Alger. "the. major general com
manding the army of the United States
appeared before the committee then sit
ting in Washington and made his state
ments with reference to the canned, fresh
and refrigerated beef furnished to the
army during the war. Although the com
mission had been sitting nearly three
months . the charges with respect to
canned and refrigerated beef were now
made for the first time; and. stranger and
more inexcusable and more unsoldierly
still, during all those months, with this
splendid knowledge of facts which, if
they existed, should have been made
known to the Secretary of War for the
protection of the army. General Miles had
never mentioned the subject.
Many thousands of soldiers were in
vited to give their evidence withou*-rank
or service.
General Alger reviews the Miles-Eagan
controversy over the alleged furnishing
of "embalmed beef" to the army and telis
of the appointment by the President at
his request 'of the commission to inves
tigate the conduct of the War Department
in the* war with Spain. The commission
met September 24, 1S9S, he says, and up
to December 21 of that year "had taken
testimony in seventeen towns and cities
and in many different camps, granting to
citizens, soldiers and ex-soldiers an op
portunity to appear for complaint or tes
timony of any kind regarding the con
duct of the war."
General Alger reviews at length the dif
ferences between General bnafter and
Admiral Sampson and concludes this
chapter in these words:
"It is dimcult to account for Admiral
Sampson's seeming attitude toward, the
army durinc the operations before San
tiago, â¢ as well as to excuse him for his
contradictory statements subsequently
made in his official report. After the 3d
of July the admiral's conduct may be due
to the keen disappointment resulting from
his non-participation in the engagement
with Cervera's squadron. Possibly he felt
that Shafter's request for a conference on
the morning of July 3, innocent though
it was, was responsible for his being de
prived of me honor of actively participat
ing as commander in chief in one of the
most remarkable victories in the annals
of naval \varfare."
Shafter and Sampson.
NEW YORK, Oct. 5.â General Alger's
book on the Spanish-American war, \u25a0which
his publishers state "has been delayed
and changed because of the death of
President McKinley," will be issued next
Thursday.
General Alger opens his book with a
survey of the Cuban situation in 1S98, and
comments upon our unpreparedness for
war at that time and the spiendid specta
cle of the country's response to the Gov
ernment's ultimatum upon Spain. He
then leads the leader through the hurried
preparations for war, the persecution of
the office-seeker, the disappointment of
hundreds of volunteers, the demands of
sea coast citie3 and towns for immediate
protection and the savage criticism of
the" military administration's plans of or
ganization and the battle with apparent
ly endless shortcomings and grievances.
Then follows the embarkation at Tampa,
which was severely criticized at the time,
but which General Alger is now convinced
that, an things consiucred, was not a mis
take. The account of the march on San
tiago is graphically pictured. . '
The book takes. up. the -round robin"
signed by the general officers of Shatt
er's army while tne negotiations for sur
render were pending, in" which it was
stated that "tnis army must move at once
or it will perish" from the fevers threat
ening the camp. General Alger has no
criticism to otter- of the round robin itself,
but says that its publication was one of
the most unfortunate and regrettable in
cidents of the war.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 5.â Mrs. Rebecca
Butler, who for several weeks has been
rooming at the St. Helena House. 326
South Broadway, was found dead in bed
this morning. Outside her window was
a bottle containing a small quantity of
laudanum and the indications are that
Mrs. Butler drank most of the contents of
the phial and then threw it out of the
window and retired to her last sleep. The
dead woman was formerly known as Re
becca Majors. In the latter part of June
or July she married a man named Butler.
Butler was a hard drinker and .after liv
ing together but a few days they sep
arated. Mrs. Butler was about 40 years
of age.

LOS AXGELES, Oct. 5.â The trial of
Captain O. P. Sloat, Company K, Seventh
Infantry, National Guard of California,
by court-martial, was resumed to-day in
Armory Hall. Major Prescott, Captain
Sloat's counsel, led off with something of
a sensation after the argument on de
murrer to the complaint. Major Prescott
moved that the entire trial be set aside,
as it had not been proceeded with under
the rules laid down by the articles of war.
He alleged that, in view of the fact that
the judge advocate was consulted in the
courtroom behind closed doors,- when he
should have been outside with advocate
for the accused. Captain Sloat should be
discharged. This motion \u25a0was overruled.
Counsel then attempted to show that all
officers sitting in judgment on Captain
Sloat's case were "in the same boat," hav
ing been guilty, he said, of the same
offense as that charged against Captain
Sloat. namely: Tardiness in forwarding
reports. Major Prescott read the general
order mentioning the names of those
guilty of tardiness, among them being
several captains now sitting in the court.
Several witnesses were examined this
afternoon, among them being Colonel
Berry.
Says Several Officers of
Seventh Are "in the
! > Same Boat."
The speech corucluded \u25a0with an enumera
tion of the proposed bills, but the King
did not mention the Danish West Indian
islands. The President of the Folkething
led three cheers for the King and consti
tutional law.
"In appointing: the new Ministry we
have responded to the wish of the ma
jority of the people, â¢ entrusting th'e
conduct of the government to men who
are in possession of the confidence of the
nation, and we cherish the strong hope
that it will be vouchsafed to us to see
fruitful co-operation between the govern
ment and the Rigsdag. We confidently
hepe that it will thus be possible to come
nearer to our great goal, namely the pre
servation of the independence of the coun

SLOAT'S COUNSEL
ACCUSES OTHERS
SANTA BARBARA. Oct. 5.â The most i
startling testimony heard in years in any
court in this county was taken this morn
ing in the Superior Court'by the defense 1
in the Kelso murder trial. The testimony
may have the effect of sending two small
but precocious boys from Santa Maria to
the reform school. One of them admits
not only having perjurod himself at the
Coroner's inquest over the body of Harry
Blochman, whom Kelso is accused of hav
ing murdered, but further admits having
j manufactured evidence hitherto regarded
as important in the case.
i The body of Iiarry blochman, showing
nine stab wouncs, was found on the even
i ing of the Saturuay after July 4. It was
I in a bean held near "the residence' of L.
K. Blochman. the foster father of the
> murdered boy. Intense excitement fol- :
I lowed in Sania Maria, and individual citi- !
! zens set out to find evidence in the case. I
While the excitement was at Its height ',
i Kmanuel .Pires, a boy of 15 years, pro
| ciuced a blood-covered whipstock. which
i he had founu in the field near the scene
of the crime. This whip was shown be
fore the Coroner's jury, and young Pires
testified in detail to the linding of it.
j To-day the lad was put upon the stand
Las a witness for the defense. He broke '
| down completely and admitted that he j
had manulaetured the evidence. He said
that at the suggestion of a boy"* of 12
years, named Floyd 'Walker, he had pro
cured the whip, taken it to a slaughter
house and covered it with blood, and then ;
secreted it in the Held near where the
body had been iound. \
The murdered boy had been a* school
mate and friend for years of the two boys
who planned the whip episode. The blood
stained whip stock has been one of the
exhibits in the case hardest to be ac
counted for. Both sides were at a loss
as to how to connect it in any way with,
the murder. Young Blochman was killed
with a knife, being stabbed nine times.
The Call correspondent here asked
Pires and young Walker about what they
had done. All Pires would say was that
if he were sent to the reform, school
Walker would go along.

CHICAGO. Oct. 5.â The drand Jury to
nig-ht voted two indictments against Rob
ert Bun, Oil [nspector a charging embez
zlement of funds of his office to the ex
tent of $23,000.
Severa.1 Â»ieys ago representatives of the
Sts.nde.rd Oil Company told the Grand
Jury that they had paid as fees to Burt
in his capacity of City Oil Inspector cer
tain sums ot money which the Grand
Jury could not tir.d in the inspector's ac
counts with the city!
Burt is chairman of the Democratic
County Central Committee and is regard
ed as the closest political friend of Mayor
Harrison. Strong efforts were made dur
ing the day by Burt and his friends to
prevent his indictment. Burl, before the
indictments were returned, paid into the
office of the State's Attorney $30,000 to
cover any shortage that might be found
in his accounts. He said at midnight:
"They indicted me after I made good
the shortage claimed. Until to-day I did
not know just how the books in the office
stood. Ever 6ince I took charge of the
office four years agr>. the chief deputy
attended to the mailing; cut of the re
ports. As soon as I learned that there
vrasÂ« a shortage of something like $23,033
I turned in $30,000 to the Comptroller's
office."
As soon as Burt learned of the indict
ment he called up State Attorney Dineen
over the telephone and said that he was
able to jjive bond.

When it is considered that the* cost of
putting the sand and water into these
boxes (.the latter often being made avail
able by gravity) should not exceed five
cents per cubic yard of sand in cases
where the plant has a working capacity
of 500 to 3000 cubic yards per day, there is
no argument against the proposition that
deposits of auriferous sands carrying val
ues in gold so low that they have been
considered worthless may now be worked
with most satisfactory results. The field
is practically limitless not only in this
country, but in others, and a veritable
boom in sand bed values seems to< be im
minent. The Nome district is of demon
strated value, and there are many depos
its upon the Alaska coast and further
south in the vicinity of Vancouver where
large and profitable operations may be
conducted. Upon the Washington. Ore
gon and California coasts ' are scores of
deposits that . would yield handsome re
turns, while the great Snake River and
the Colorado present fields practically ln
*exhaustlble. The Rose Gold-Reclamation
Company has opened general offices in the
Call building, this city, "suite 614.
An appliance has just been perfected in
this city for the reclamation of fine, flour
like and microscopic gold values contained
in deposits of auriferous sands. Tlieso
sands are found upon ocean beaches
as well as in beds'" and upon the
bars "of rivers and streams which
promise to startle the mining world intu
renewed and active quest. for .gold-bearing
sands. The process is the invention of
Mr. P. M. Johnson, the well known as
sayer of San Francisco, and has been
purchased by the Rose Gold Re
clamation Company, a ' corporation
organized by a number of gentle
men well known locally, ior the purpose
of operating it and placing it upon the
market in this and foreign countries. The
appliance is so simple and inexpensive in
construction and .operation and. "does itps
work so effectively that the results seem
of the magical order rather than the ap
plication, of a principle whose simplicity
causes wonder that it was not long ago
discovered and applied; It; not omy
saves the gold, but the platinum as well,
and does it at no [greater cost than the
ordinary expense involved in getting the
sand and water into it.
The exterior of the invention shows a
box of the ordinary sluicing pattern? built
of one-inch boards, twelve feet in length,
twelve" inches in width and five inches in
depth. The interior (covered by patents
applied fot) which saves the gold and
platinum values is a matter of arrange
ment rather than of material, the latter
costing not to exceed $1 50. Neither plates,
mercury nor magnets are used.
When it is stated that two to three tons
of sand per hour were run through one
of these appliances day - after day, don
secutively, during a trial test of about 30
days upon the beach sands at Aptos, near
Santa Cruz, Cal., and that all of the gold
and platinum carried by the sands were
reclaimed and saved, the practical value
of the invention to the mining world be
comes apparent. The gold saved in this
test run averaged fully 400 colors of gold
to the cent in value. In addition there
have been numerous and exhaustive tests
of sands from Nome,' the Snake and Co
lumbia rivers, of the. beach sands upon
the California, Oregon and Washington
coasts as well as those from the Colorado
River, where the deposits are -of vast ex
tent and carry high values.
These boxes may be placed in batteries
of five, ten, twenty or more, up to any
number desired, and the sand and water
may be put into .them either by hand or
with mechanical appliances â no further
expense in operation being required. They
may also be used as an adjunct to ordi
nary sluicing or hydraulleking operations,
with the result of saving the values in
fine gold contained in the ' sand concen
trates which are otherwise lost.

The largest nugget ever found In this north
ern country was uncovered this morning at 7
o'clock on the famous discovery claim on An
vil Creek, owned by the Pioneer Mining Com
pany. It weighs 97 ounces, ati'l at $16 an
ounce is worth exactly $1532. At $18 an ounce,
which is about the worth or the Anvil Creek
jrold. the nuprKFt is worth $174fi. The nugget
was found while a posthole â¢ was being sunk
on the west side of the. claim, a little above
the center. A pile of tailings had covered the
spot since last year, and those were removed
yesterday. It Is almost circular in shape, about
six and a half Inches In diameter and two and
a quarter inches at the widest part.
The Nome Nugrget describes what is
claimed as the largest nugget ever found
in Alaska as- follows:
-Colorado is arranging for a gravel prop
osition on a large scale. Interest will be
(irttached to this on account of the very
large -developments- in the northern part
,of. California in the gravel mines, espe
cially in the . Sweepstake and nearby
properties. At Breckenridge, Colo., the
Gold Pan Mining Company has completed
a railway up the Blue River and is lay
ing S000 feet of, pipe, sixty inches in diam
eter, and is also constructing a ditch.
This is the, biggest placer, pipe ever laid
in Colorado. It will give the company a
water pressure of 350 feet to work its
hydraulic mining and the elevators which
are used to elevate the gravel.
The American Mining News is enthu
siastic concerning the auriferous gravels
of the northern part "of California. - "If
one-half of the stories told . about the
wealth of these vast and practically vir
gin tracts are confirmed in 'the' future,"
says the News, "the Klondike and other
famed gold fields of the world will fade
into comparative insignificance. The dis
coveries already made confirm the state
ments of mining men of prominence that
so far only, the surface of gold-bearing
lands of the State has been scraped. Even
t/iis'cannot be said of the deposits of this
northern territory, where ' the gravel, is
still intact and free from the suspicion of
any exhaustive i work."

DRUGGISTS MUST BE CHARY.
They Sell All Kinds of Hair Prepara-
tions, and Fear to discriminate.
Druggists sell all kinds of hair^prcp-
arations and as a rule they are-*wisely
chary of giving preference to any : par-
ticular one, but many of them have come
out plainly for Newbro's Herpicide, tho
new treatment that absolutely kills the
dandruff aerm. H. Swanhell & Son
Champaign, 111., say: "One customer of
ours who did not have a hair on top of
his head when he began to use Herpicide
now has a fair start toward a good head
of hair. We believe Herpicide to be by
far the best preparation of its kind on the
market." - Hundreds of similar testimo-
nials from everywhere.

* Doctor Wanata, of Lansing, Mich.,
Says : There is Nothing in the Materia Medica that
" Equals Lydia E. Pinkham f s Vegetable Com-
ponnd for, the Cure of Woman's His.
% "Dear Mrs. Pinkham :â The honest, intelligent physician is atxyvÂ©
the * School' Whatever is best in each" case should be used, no matter
to what school a physician belongs. I, as a matter of conscience, can
only/prescribe the best, and as I know and have proven that there is
nothing in Materia Meaica which equals Xydia E. Pinkbam's Vege-
table Compound in severe cases of female disorders, I unhesitatingly
prescribe it, and have never yet been sorry.
"I know of nothing better for ovarian troubles and for falling of
the womb or ulcerations; it absolutely restores the affected parts to
their normal condition quicker and better than anything else. I have
known it to cure barrenness in women, who to-day are happy mothers
; of children, and while the medical profession looks down upon * patents,'
I have learned, instead, to look-up to the healing potion, by whatever
name it be known. If my fellow physicians dared tell the truth, hundreds
of them would voice my sentiments."â Db. Wanata, Lansing, Mich.
DR. WANATA.
AsDr. Wanata says, if physicians dared to be frank and open, hun-
dreds of them would acknowledge that they constantly prescribe Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound in severe cases of female ills, as
they know by experience that it can be relied upon to effect a cure.
i Women who are troubled with painful or irregular menstruation,
"^backache, bloating (or flatulence), leucorrhcea, falling, inflammation or
ulceration of the uterus, ovarian, troubles, that "bearing-down" feeling,
dizziness, faintness, indigestion, nervous prostration or the blues should
take immediate action to ward off the serious consequences, and be
restored to perfect health and strength by taking Lydia E. Pinkbam's
Vegetable Compound, and then write to Mrs. Pmkham, Lynn, Mass.,
for further free advice. \u25a0 No living person has had such a vast and
successful experience in treating female ills. She has guided thousands
to health. Every suffering woman should ask for and follow her advice.
Iiydia E. Pintdiam's Vegetable Compound has carried hundreds
of women through the periods of child bearing and change of life in
perfect" comfort and safety.-
fi. medicine that has restored so many women to health and can produce
proof of the fact must be regarded with respect. This is the record of JjydlaE.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, which cannot be equalled by any
other medicine the world has ever produced.
. . Tt is well to remember these facts when some druggist tiies to get yon to
buy something which he says is " just as good." That is impossible, as no
. other medicine has such a record of cures as Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound ; so do not experiment with untried medicines.

December advanced and .-closed firm. %@%c up,

closed a shade higher at 35%c.

NEW TORK STOCK" LIST.
NEW" YORK, Oct. 5.â The holiday in London
to-day accentuated the dullness, here and
tended to relax the selling pressure, as London
has been a constant seller In this market of
late. The fact that there is no loan market
at the Stock Exchange on Saturday also
tended to relax the pressure upon the market.
Perception is growing of the fact that the
question of the effect of the Interior demand
for money on the stock market has passed the
stage of argument and has resolved itself into
a question of how much further stock market
liquidation may have to extend. While there
has bean no stringency of money during the
week, this has been due to the fact that in
reducing tbeir outstanding loans bankers have
been discriminating against Industrial collat
eral rather than marking up the ruling rates
for call loans. Owing to the continued firm
ness of sterling exchange. In spite of a larger
supply of cotton bills this week, relief by gold
Imports does not appear imminent. Demand
continues Irom bankers short of exchange, and
exprrts in that market declare that a large
short Interest remains . to be covered during
November. It is said that some fresh
sterling loans have been negotiated this week.
The loan lncreaS3-in the bank statement re
vealed that other forces are still at work in
the credit market, which offset the stock
market liquidation. This and the renewed
pressure against Amalgamated Copper de
pressed the whole market.
There has been some irregularity In the stock
market from time to time during the week,
and dealings have bacn on a small scale. The
course of prices in the main had been down
ward and the weakness increased during 1 the
latter part of the week. -The support of the
market' at the weak spots, which was a fea
ture during the crisis following the assassina
tion of - President McKInley and which was at
tributetl to the joint efforts of the great bank
ing and financial powers of the country, has
been ccnsplculusly lackinjr. The liquidation
has not been heavy nor apparently urgent, but
very light demand was forthcoming at the
declines, and there seemed to be a general
fiirreemtnt of sentiment In the street that a
reactionary movement was due and need not ba
contested.
Money market conditions have continued
favorable, but the termination of the interior
demand for currency is awaited to Insure
further conditions.
' Railroad bonds have been dull and Irregular.
United States 3s declined %, the 5s % and

Fruit and Salmon in England.
ThÂ« London Grocers' Gazette of September
21 says: "The market for salmon continues
quiet; Alaska is easier to the extent of perhaps
Sd per case. . Fraser River is steady at late
quotations, but there is a continued absence
of market business. On the other hand, from
all reports, the consumptive demand in the
country is tood and the low prices have ap
parently considerably Increased the public.in
quiry. There Is more demand for apricots,
pears and peaches,- and there are indications
of the country buying these goods, probably
in anticipation of a big advance in the spring.
Pineapples sre quiet."
Dried Fruit in New York.
Mail reports from New Tork say: - :
"Interest at the close of the week centered
in the situation on new California raisins,
which was so unsettled and confused that
many in the trade were unable to fln;l out
where they stood. At the low prices of 3%c,
4Vic and 4%c for loose muscatels and Hie for
Ecedless f. o. b. coast, local buyers took hold
very liberally, but a large number of the or
ders for new goeds had not been confirmed by
the California packers up to a late hour Sat
urday and there was a good deal of bitter
criticism of what was regarded by some as a
lack of good faith by the Raisin Association
and the packers.
"Nevertheless a very fair business was put
through in loose raisins. Orders for -.seedless
were generally turned down or ignored. So
far as we \u25a0were able to learn 'only one packer
had confirmed any up to noon and that only
a very small quantity. Offers for several cars
of new seeded at 5%c f. o. b. coast were made
Friday by a large wholesale house but had not
been confirmed at this writing. There were all
sorts of rumors and guesses in circulation at
the clCEe of the market here. The general feel
ing was that the low-price tactics would force
the growers into line and that prices would be
decidedly higher this week. There were, how
ever, reports from the coast that prices would
go still lower. Generally speaking, to say that
.the trade was mixed and suspicious is to put
it mildly.
"Currants were slightly firmer on the spot,
with some demand in a small way. Prices for
goods to arrive per Manln were steady and un
changed at 6@6^4c for Amalias. - Cables report
ed the Greek market higher.
'"A car of new Santa Clara prunes met with
quite good sale at 7%c in sacks and SUc In
25- lb boxes.
"Trade in new unpeeled peaches showed
pome Improvement 'during the week, goods
selling from 7<310 1 ,Â£c for boxes and 6\<iij9\ic for
bags."
Nezv York Money Market. .
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews says:
"The money market has undergone- some
change for the better. Considerable relief has
been afforded by Secretary Gage's efforts to
neutralize Treasury absorptions, and this re
moves the most important source of apprehen
sion. The. crop demands, however, are not yet
satisfied, business requirements are large, and
as bank reserves are likely to- experience fur
ther depletion before the return movement of
currency begins, money will probably not be
easy, enough or plentilul enough for any bull
campaign. Relief from gold imports is still
a very uncertain quantity. If absolutely nec
essary we will unquestionably be able to draw
gold from Europe, but it will come reluctantly.
As intimated In our previous advices, Pnris.
though abundantly able to spare considerable
gold, would resist Its movement this way. .The
financial tension in Germany 13 considerable
because of trade reaction; London Is cautious,
and the probable placing of Russian and other
Government loans is not likely to aid the
movement of gold In this direction,
standing our continued favorable trade bal
ances. Very soon wa ought to have a better
supply of grain and cotton bills, and it re
mains to be seen what effect these will have
on the sterling exchange market. In my opin
ion gold imports, this fall will be strictly
moderate.
"The outlook for the market, therefore, re
mains unsettled. Railroad shares are In rela
tively good condition, recent declines., good
earnings and concentration of ownership plac
ing them in a fairly, favorable position to re
sist attacks from bear raids, but no genuine
bull campaign can be expected until easier
money is assured and until the big men co
operate to that end, v.-hich Just at present
they are apparently not disposed to do. The
movements of the lndustrlnls will also play
an important part In the r.iarket-for next sev
eral months at least, and I fear to the detri
ment of the general market."

The Financier says: It Is noteworthy that the
shipments of money : to the intcricr last week
were unusually heavy, amounting, . Including
transfers through the Sub-Treasury, to $3,767,
300 and the direct movement of money was
quite largely to the Eost, while considerable
amounts were sent to St. Louis and to. other
Southwestern points; the return movement was
principally from Philadelphia and other neigh
boring cities. It is also worthy of.note that
the fiscal operations of the Sub-Treasury con
tinue to absorb considerable sums of money
from the banks, as is shown, by the fact 'that
last week the excess of receipts over payments
by that office was $3,430,200. Inasmuch as
Treasury disbursements tot bonds. Mill here
after be comparatively small, the buying of the
4 per cents of 1925, having, been suspended by
order, of the Secretary of the' Treasury, the
fiscal operation' of the department, should re
ceipts continue in excess of payments, will
be likely to have an Important influence upon
the cash reserves of the banks. There will
probably be considerable amounts of Yukon
gold transferred to this center from Pacific
Coast- points during the current week -through
assay office checks, which will somewhat offset
bank losses to the Sub-Treasnury and the In
terior. . â¢. . - . \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0â¢ . . \u25a0
