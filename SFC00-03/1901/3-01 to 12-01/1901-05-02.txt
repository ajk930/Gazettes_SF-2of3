Residents of Phoenix Will
Escort the Distinguished
Guests to Congress Shaft
PHOENIX/ Ariz., May 1.â Plans have
been virtually completed for the recep
tion to be given President McKlnley and
his party on May 7. ' Perhaps one of the
moat delicate subjects. in connection with
the . reception ' of the President was set
tled last; night, when the personnel of the
party which .will dine with the President
a.n<J his Cabinet was made up. Arizona,
In its several branches of government,
will ' bÂ« represented by. the following
hosts: N. O. Murphy. Governor; Charles
H. Aher. Secretary "of Arizona; Webster
Street, Chief Justice; E. Ganz, -Mayor.
Tha City Council has appropriated
$1000 for the reception, the Board of
Supervisors a, like amount, and money has
been raised in other. ways. . A large part
of this fund has been appropriated for
â¢decorations and the streets will be a mass
of flags, bunting. arid flowers. The Board
of Trade is making a' special exhibition
for the. President ' and party. " A novel
feature; will be the presentation sto the
'President of -ilia likeness "photographed
on a slab of onyx from the Ileyman quar
ries.
As the plans for the day are, now ar
ranged, the Presidential K party .will ; see
a large -part of Maricopa County and a
part' of Tavapai 1 County, doubtless the
richest agricultural and mineral districts

our products: and the way to do that ls^to
make them familiar -with our flag.

rT"\ HE matter of accommodations
I '- for visitors during thÂ© reception
I . weÂ«k ta San Francisco is being
| looked to In earnest. It is tha
: â¢Â¦- Intention of the accommodations
i' committee to establish a head
quarters and to register there all rooms
available. It was the first duty of the
committee to secure accommodations for
the Presidential party and the guests from
Ohio, but that has all been attended to
and there remains now the duty of caring
for the comfort of those who come to
town to see the President and to attend
the functions prepared In his honor.
George A. Xewhall. chairman of the
committee on accommodations, has only
just returned from the East, but he says
he will take up the work of his committee
at once and will secure ' all available
rooifis for guests who will come to the
city from the East or the interior.
Some idea of the travel westward may
be gained from a dispatch from Chicago
which says that between thirty and forty
thousand people, taking: advantage of the
last day of the reduced rate, left Chicago
for Pacific Coast destinations last Tues
day. And/the number that will como
from the 'East will be but a fraction of
those who will come from the "interior of
the State to stay from one day to through
.the reception week. The problem of caring
for all these, when the hotels are already
full, will bÂ» one of the biggest In tho
whole scheme of entertainment.
Commencing on the day that McKlnley
arrives there will be open-house In most
of the clubs and In various headquarters.
The Union League will be entertaining the
President and the Governor of Ohio and
Cabinet offlceffc and Congressmen from
Ohio and it will keep the clubrooms In a
state of sociability for At least the week
of McKlnley's stay if not longer. The
Governor's staff will establish headquar
ters In the Palace Hotel and they, too,
will entertain lavishly their brother offi
cers of the Ohio Governor's staff .and
numerous friends.
" Staff Entertainment.
'The topic cf extending courtesies to tha
military representatives of the Buckeye
State .was discus'sed' yesterday at the office
of Colonel George 'H. Pippy. Governor
Gagt! and Adjutant General Seamans wero
present. It was decided to establish head
quarters In tlie Palace Hotel and these
receive the visiting colonels from the
East.
Lieutenant Colonel Frank A- Vail has
been reappointed lieutenant colonel and
A. D. C. on the staK of Governor Gage.
Tho Legislature at its last session pro
vided that the Naval Reserve of Califor
nia should be represented on the staff of
the Governor by an officer who should be
entitled to the rank of comander. Gover
nor Gage has accordingly appointed on his
staff Randolph " H. Miner, lieutenant.
United States "navy, retired. The newly
commissioned commander dwells in Los
Angeles, .but he will doubtless visit San
Francisco during the President's sojourn
in this city and will mo3t likely join his
fellow. members of the staff in the pleas
ant duty of escorting the President of the
United States from Stockton to Sacra
mento. \
Members of the Governor's staff re
ceived the unwelcome . news yesterday
that they would not be expected to array
themselves in . regulation attire and ac
company the Governor to Redlands. On
this trip the Governor proposes to take
the chances of getting through without
any military assistance whatever. It is
even hinted that the adjutant general,
who, ; next to Major General Dickinsen.
is the most conspicuous military figure in
California, will attend the Grand Army
encampment at Pacific Grove while the
Governor is in the south receiving tho
President. Colonels and lieutenant col
onels, seeing that a brigadier and chief of
staff Is not expected to accompany the
Governor, to Redlands, have but slender
hope of receiving an order to perform
escort duty in the southland.
: It is not yet settled that the colonels
and lieutenant colonels comprising Gov
ernor Gage's military family will" attend
banquets and other functions as a "staff."
The popular sentiment of tho country
against any form of military despotism
may constrain the commander-ln-chlef to
suggest that General Seamans and Col-'
onels Doblittle, Pippy. Kirkpatrick and
Vail shall dine as simple citizens of the
republic.
r l_ : _ Preparing for "Crooks."
In every town in the State, as well as In
San Francisco, preparations are being
made for the reception of the unwelcome
gentry as well as the distinguished guests,
but the reception of the unwelcome
will not be so acceptable to them. With
the thousands of people who will Journey
to California In the wake of the Presi
dent's train and just before there will
be a number who return to work fields of
wealth concealed In pockets. Bunko men,
short-card men, shell and pea men, three
card monte men, pickpockets of all de
grees and sneakthleves will make up a
part of the traveling crowds. They are
expected, however, and in every town the
police are already on the alert to meet
them and take care of them. Already pic-Â«
tures and descriptions of all the promi
nent "crooks" who show a disposition to
move westward have been sent to tha
leading police departments of California
and police officers everywhere are memor
izing faces and descriptions preparatory
to giving greeting to those whom they fit.
Here In San Francisco the incoming
trains are already under inspection by old
timo policemen and detectives and bj

quet last "night until after 1 o'clock he
was up early this morning. Several times
he appeared on the rear platform and ac
knowledged the cheers of the crowds at
the "small stations with a wave of his
hand. V.Ov
â¢Vicksburg, with Its swarming memories
of the Civil War, was. reached at 8:30
o'clock. In reply to the welcome extended
by the Mayor and citizens the President
spoke as follows: ' ".- "r
It gives me very great pleasure to receive the
official greeting of the Mayor and the'warm
hearted touch of the people as they give us
greeting to this historic' city. The highest ex
pression of . satisfaction at this roost cordial
reception is in the single word that you make
mo feel at home. Nowhere in my native State
of Ohio could I receive warmer or more sin
cere welcome than I have received at the hands
of and from the hearts of the people of Mis
sissippi, and in Â¦ the moment that I have to en-
Joy with you I can ' only make my acknowl
edgments and congratulate you on . that you
share in the universal /prosperity and content
ment Â»o characteristic at this time of every
part of our common country. 'Â¦*Â¦' ".''*'-
We know that whatever others may say or
think this to us and for us is the best country
in' the. world. It is the land we love and It Is
the. land of possibilities and . of opportunities
to every child . that, dwells beneath the folds
of our flag. I have been glad not only to be
greeted by the veterans of the . Grand Army
of the Republic, but' by the Confederate vet
erans, by the people at large; but no welcome
could be so : sweet to me as that- of the fresh
young school children from the city of Vieks
burg. Â¦
To one and all I return my sincere and heart
felt thanks and leave -.with .you ,the .wish for
your happiness and your prosperity. .."
His First Visit.
This was the first time a President had
visited Vicksburg since the days of Zach
ary Taylor. ' The ' Presidential â¢ partyV was
received " with the greatest enthusiasm.'
The party disembarked just outside of the
city- at the . National Cemetery, which . Is
located on Â¦ the ' si te â¢ of ' the , place - where
Pemberton; surrendered 'to Grant at "the
eloquently, "can never be omitted from
the pages of history. The romance of an
tiquity, the quaintness of ancient days, In
spire us with veneration. The tireless en
ergy of her people. makes her one of the
most progressive of the modern marts of
commerce." x
The President was cheered loudly as he
took his seat. An enterprising photogra
pher then entered with his camera and
took a flashlight picture of the banquet
hall and guests, while the President stood
up with the Governor and the Mayor on
either side of him.
Toward . midnight the guests began to
disperse, but It was 12:30 o'clock before
the banquet was at an end. The Presi
dent then retired to his room a thor
oughly tired man, ,bu the must be up
bright and 'early to-morrow morning to
attend the ceremonies at the Cablldo,
where the transfer "of Louisiana was ef
fected.
President McKlnley already begins to
look tired and haggard. He has yet more
than five weeks ahead of him, and Mrs.
McKinley Is fearful that the strain upon
him will prove too much for one In his
physical condition. Mrs. McKlnley Is
herself in a very delicate state of health
and the President Is quite as much' con
cerned for her health as for his
own. Dr. Rlxey, the family physician, de
clares that the President is In as sound
a physical condition as he has been'in
several years, but this is not saying a
great deal, for' his health has not been
good since the outbreak of the Spanish-
American war.

N< â¢ EW ORLEANS, May l.-It was
a very tired and duety party
that alighted from Hie Presi
dential train this afternoon.
_ ' The President appeared almost
exhausted and Mrs. McKiuley
was also greatly fatigued.
The train arrived on schedule time. Kx
actly at 4:27 a faint whistle was heard
and the Louisiana Field Artillery began
the national salute of twentv-one guns.
The long train swept gracefully around a
curve as the cannonading ceased and then
the crowd set up Its cheering. It was not
a large crowd nor a very noisy one. In
deed, the reception In this quaint old city
was unlike ary other along the route. It
would be too much to say that the peo
ple were indifferent or apathetic: certain
ly they wero not so Intentionally, for on
every hand were heard the most kindly
expressions of regard. Perhaps the ap
parent apathy may be ascribed to the op
pressively warm weather. However that
rcay be, the crowd at the station to greet
the Presidential Â¦ party was a very small
and a Quiet one.
It had been arra.nced that the ladies of
the party should be driven In separate
carriages to- the St. Charles Hotel through
a s!de street and the President himself
escorted Mrs. McKlnley to her carriage.
The graceful a.ct elicited a hearty, out
burst of applause from the Louisianans,
for it appealed to their chivalry and gal
lantry. ; ' .'â¢*:'â¢.'"",'.Â¦
The President was then escorted to his
own carriage by Governor Heard, Mayor
Capedeylelle and Congressmen Davey,
Meyers and Robertson.
Some . obstreperous negroes were with
difficulty suppressed Â¦ and the President
had an anxious look on his face' a3 police
men with difficulty cleared a passage for
his carriage. TIjen the procession pro
ceeded down a v^ry narrow street lined
with but few people, blacks seeming to
predominate. There .was littlo cheering
heard along the Jice of inarch. The dec
orations were lew and not at all elabor
ate.
Greeting at Hotel.
But the good people of New Orleans had
?been preparing for the event for weeks
and though the reception from a spectac
ular point of view Â¦was not a great suc
cess, being described as almost funereal
by some members cf the party, the New
Orleans people regarded It as one of the
proudest events in the history of the
Crescent City. There was only one epi
sode out of the ordinary. One of the front
wheels of the carriage In which Secre
tary Hay was riding slipped from the
axle and the occupants were almost
thrown from their seats. Secretary Hay
v*is given' a seat in the carriage immedi
ately following and the procession, after
moving along Canal and St. Charles
streets, finally arrived at the St. Charles
Hotel, where the party is temporarily
domiciled.
Here occurred the only real show of an
imation observed in the entire reception.
The lobby was thronged with- people and
as the President stepped from his carriage
and went through the rotunda to the hotel
elevator a mighty shout went up and it
was only with the greatest difficulty that
he and his escort could make their way
through the surging mass of men and
women. One of h!s escorts was ex-Con
gressman Boatner. who went with the
President to his room. Congressman
Bcatner was the friend and admirer of
Mr. McKinley when the two served on the
same committee in the Fifty-fifth Con
gress. When they reached the President's
room he whispered confidentially:
"Mac, ain't they almost killed you?"
"No. Bcatner." replied the President,
"you can't kill a man with kindness."
In the evening the President was the
guest of honor at a grand banquet. Cov
ers were laid for COO people and fully that
number were seated in the large dining
hall of the St. Charles Hotel at 9 o'clock.
The rooms were brilliantly illuminated
with myriads of miniature electric bulbs,
forming stars, flags and crescents. The
guests were seated at long tables deco
rated with huge bowls of pink roses. The
President, Cabinet, Secretaries and a few
other distinguished guests were seated on
an elevated platform. On the President's
right was the Governor of Louisiana,
Hen. "W. "W. Heard, and on his left the
Mayor of New Orleans. Xear the Presi
dent were seated both of Louisiana's
Senators, McEnery and Foster. Admiral
Melville, Henry T. Scott of San Francisco
and Secretary Cortelyou. Over the Presi
dent's head were twined the President's
flag and the flag of the Governor of Louis
iana. The covers of the menu cards were
handsomely embossed with these flags in
colors, and a finely engraved portrait of
the President adorned one of the inner
leaves of the menu cards.
The first speaker. Governor Heard,
praised the State of Louisiana for half an
hour. Then the Mayor presented Presi
dent McKihley, while the band played
"The Star-Spangled Banner." The Presi
dent spoke in a very high-pitched voice
and with great effort, yet his words were
Â¦well chosen and were repeatedly and
heartily cheered. He alluded to the im-
Sienpe territory of the original State of
Louisiana, out of which six entire States
and parts of six others had been carved.
"Jefferson," said he, "appreciated the
strategic and commercial importance of
the town of Xew~Orleans, and Jackson
successfully defended the flag: that Jeffer
son raised." (Great and prolonged ap
plause.)
The band struck up . "Dixie" and the
Louisianans all stood up.

P. H. McGrath, assistant secretary of
the Board of Examiners, notified Stale
Controller Colgan under date of March 29
that the board had that day appointed the
three above named as clerks, but the ap
pointments did not becom,e generally
known until to-day.
Attorney General Ford was not only ig- I
nored In the distribution of the slums of
patronage but he was not vouchsafed in
formation of any meeting of the board or
its appointments. When told last nifcht
that the clerks were in office and drawing
their salaries he" insisted that The Call
must be mistaken in its information.
"You are certainly misinformed," . the
Attorney General said, "for 1 know posi
tively that the appointments have not yet
been made. In fact 1 have a letter from
the' secretary of the board in response to
one I. wrote him and in which he informs
me that I will be duly notified when these
appointments are to be considered by the
board so that I can te personally present
at such meeting." My letter from the sec
retary is dated April 4, so you see the
appointments could not have been mada
prior to that. time. You have certainly 1 *
been in some way misinformed."
Put Actions in Peculiar Light.
This letter from Dan Kevane, secretary
of the board, to the Attorney General
and the statement of Attorney General
Ford put the action of the other members,
in a peculiar light. There . being three
Â¦ new .; clerks to. appoint .courtesy, would
have dictated that each of the three mem
bers of the -board name one clerk, ,. So
far from 'sucli rule being followed the At
torney General was not even informed of.
the board's intention to meet for the pur
pose of appointment, nor afterward, of the
appointments having been made until
told by a representative of The Call last
night. Worse still, six days after the
appointments were made, under date of
April 4, in response to an inquiry written
April 2, Secretary Kevane wrote the At
torney General that he would be duly
notified when the appointment of clerks
vras to be made, so that he might be
present. ' . .
To be ignored in the distribution of pat
ronage by his official colleagues, to have
his functions usurped by the secretary of
tha board and to be misinformed by the
secretary and given to understand that
the appointments are yet to be madeâ all
this is not balm for the Attorney General,
and the attainment of harmony between
the Governor and Attorney General Ford
is apparently now but an Iridescent
dream.
Friends of Attorney General Ford pre
dict a lively session of the Board of Ex
aminers when the next meeting is heid
unless the precedent established in this
case be followed and the Attorney Gen
eral be left to learn from the press a
month afterward that a meeting has been
held. Â¦ - -;-Â¦ :* â¢-
The three additional clerks were author
ized by. bills that were passed by. the last
Legislature practically, without opposition;
they being known as "Governor's meas
ures." One, Senate bill 430, was intro
duced by Senator Wolfe. It amended sec
tion 6S5 of the Political Code to read that
the Board of Examiners may appoint four
clerks to the secretary of the board. As
the law stood before but one clerk was
allowed. Under the new law two of the
four receive $1600 annual salary and the
other two $1200. The other bill. Assembly
bill 606, had Broughton for its sponsor.
It provided an appropriation of $1125 for
the payment for the . remainder of the
fifty-second fiscal year of the salaries of
the additional clerks.

ago he tendered his resignation, which

It is generally acknowledged that Mr.
Ambrose did not of his own accord hand
in his resignation. In fact it i3 openly
asserted In railroad circles here that hÂ«
Is being made the scapegoat for the blun
dering of others In connection with tto
unsatisfactory work on the Santa Bar
bara division. The construction on that
line was in the charge and under th<s
supervision of Mr. Ambrose, but tnoss
who are in a position to know state that
he worked under restrictions from head
quarters. Since President Hays has de
clared the road unserviceable It is Inti
mated certain heads of departments have
been seeking to ftnd some one upon whoso
shoulders the blame could be thrust. The
resignation of Mr. Ambrose is the result.
Mr. Ambrose first took up the work as
engineer of construction for the Southern
Pacific Company In 1SS2. He has since
been constantly in Us employ in the San
Joaquin Valley. For several years past
he has been a resident of Kern, and dur
ing this time has made innumerable
friends who express regret at his having
been forced to sever his connection with
the company. His retirement is regretted

â¢ A FEW FACTS
About the New Catarrh. Cure.
The new Catarrh Cure Is a new depart-
ure in so-called catarrh cures because It
actually, cures, and is not simply a tem-
porariv relief.
The new â¢ Catarrh Cure is not a salve,
ointment, powder nor liquid, but a pleas-
.-, ant tasting tablet containing the best spe-
. cifiee for catarrh, in a concentrated, con-
Â¦*'â¢ vcnlent form. . .
â¢ The old style of catarrh salves' and oint-
-ments are greasy, dirty, and Inconvenient
at the best; the new preparation being in,
tablet form is always clean and con-
venient.
The new Catarrh Cure Â¦ Is superior to
Catarrh powders because it Is a notorious
fact that rriany catarrh powders contain
i cocaine. Â¦ . Â¦
The new Catarrh Cure is called Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, a wholesome combina-
tion of blood root, beeebwood tar, guaiacol
and other antiseptics, and cures by its
action upon the blood and mucous mem-
branes, the only rational treatment for
catarrhal trouble.
'-. you do not have to. draw upon your
Imagination to discover whether you are
getting benefit from Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets; improvements and relief are appa-
rent from -the nrst tablet taken.
All druggists sell and recommend them.
They coet but 50 cents for full sized pack-
ages, and any catarrh sufferer who. has
â¢ -wasted time and money on sprays; .salves
and Jpowders will appreciate to the full
t*>Â« merit of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
Old age, like disease, brings infirmities; and with the advancing
years' come tho wasted muscles, the failing strength, the wrinkled
visage and uncertain step. In old age the vitality fe lowered, tha
heart beats with a feebler pulse and the blood moves throagh *he
body at a sluggish pace. The digestion is easily deranged,- the
nervous forces are weakened and the resistive poWerfc are greatly
reduced. It is then that tonics and strengtheners are gratefully
received by the failing body; and when the tonic is combined with

AUSTIN, Tex., May Lâ Tix9 people of
Texas are running mad on the subject of
oil Block epeculatlon. The wonderful dis
covery of oil in the Beaumont field has
led to the organization of over 2)0 oil
companies in this State within the past
three months. ThÂ« charters of tweaty
flvo new oil companies were Cled In tha
office of th* Secretary ot State herÂ© to
day.
Tho ag-gresa-te capital stock Is nearly
$14,000,000. The largest of the companies
chartered tc-.<Jay Ur tha Anglo-American
Oil Company, with Its principal office at
Beaumont. It has a capital stock of
$5,000,080 and Its purpose is to build and
operate & *vÂ»tem ot oil pipe lines, tanks
and cars. Thla pipe line will extend to
all parts of the Beaumont oil fields and
tvIII connect the field with a deep-water
port either at Port Arthur or Galveston.
The lncorporators are all Beaumont men.
Another bJg company chartered to-day
is the Beaumont Standard Oil Company,
xrfth a capital stock of $2,000,000 and the
principal office at Beaumont. Among its
Â¦' Incorporators are George Z. Laild, W. C.
Teter of New York and George S. Brown
all of Lebanon, Pa.
The Favorite Company and the Sour
Lake Oil Company, both having their prin
cipal oflices at Beaumont and- each capi
talized for $1,000,000, were also among the
number of companies organized to-day.
The "bringing in" of an oil gusher In
Louisiana, forty-five miles east of Beau
mont, broadens the oil field and makes it
one of the largest known' oil regions in
the world. This new discovery added fuel
to the speculation flame and prices of
land situated between the new well and
the Texas g-usher advanced several hun
dred pÂ«r cent to-day and are still climb
ing skyward. C. X. Lufkln of Lima, Ohio,
who holds the position of flelfi investigator
with the Standard Oil Company, has been
at Eeaumont for some time. "Wnen asked
to-day what he thought of the situation
In the Beaumont field and when this un
precedented oil speculation fever is going
to end here, he replied:
"I haven't the slightest Idea when it
will end. I am unable to think a day
Into the future of this thing. It may last
a Â¦week or ten years. No one can tell. It
is the strangest situation I ever saw In oil
matters or anything else. In ordinary
times one might think that a dry hole or
a limit to the field would have some ef
fect on the conditions, but people seem to
have forgotten and do not care what hap
pens to the field. It Is the thing of least

BAKERSFIELD, May Lâ The Combined

lined the plan of organization and the
lines on which It will be conducted. It Is
th.e intention to organize a corporation
which will have a capital stock of $500,000,
divided into 5009 shares of the par value of
$100 each. Each person or corporation de
siring to become associated must purchase
at least ten shares. Of the remaining
shares 2600 will be issued to a trustee, to
be selected by the producers, who shall
hold euch shares for the benefit of all
producers becoming members and stock
holders in the Institution. This Is done
to prevent any person or clique obtaining
control of the association. The object of
having each company subscribe a given
number of shares Is to place them on an
equal looting and to provide funds for the
corporation, so that It may have a stand-
Ing in the financial world.
"While it Is not so stated. It is the gen
eral opinion of oil men that the associa

COUNTRY STORE SAFE
YIELDS RICH RETURNS
Cayucos.
CATUCOS, May 1.â Burglars entered
the general merchandise store of De Got
tardi & Righetti last night, opened the
safe and obtained more than $8600 in cash.
Entrance to the store was effected by bor
ing four holes through the rear door with
an extension bit and slipping the door
bolt. The safe has a combination lock,
but the proprietors are not certain
whether the safe door was locked when
the store closed at 9 o'clock last night.
Evidently it was opened by manipulation,
as it shows no marks of violence. The
money* consisted of gold and silver and
was in sacks in tho upper part of the safe.
All was taken except about $2 In small
ecln.
N. de Gottardi of the firm returned yes
terday from Los Angeles with more than
$6000 in coin to take up the debts of tho
firm. This money was placed in the safe,
of which fact the burglars probably had
information. The safe also contained,
jewelry . and negotiable papers, but these
were not disturbed.
The safe is one that passed through a
fire here a few years ago and is by no
means burglar proof. It is surprising that
the proprietors should have placed such
a large sum in It. Several persons knew
the combination of the safe, but no one is
under suspicion. A reward of $500 is of
fered for the arrest of the burglars. -:Â¦â¢ â¢ ,

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
CAL.L BUREAU. 1406 Q STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, May 1.â Germany's
mysterious procedure in the Caribbean
Sea is giving naval officials some concern.
The Germsui cruiser Veneta has Just com
pleted surveys of the island of Margarita.
These surveys are supplemental of others
which German vessels have made among
the West Indies. It Is known by naval
officers to be the custom of the German
Naval Department to send its/training
ships to the Caribbean ostensibly for
practice cruises, but really to familiarize
the officers with navigation there and to
make surveys. 'â¢?
No apprehension is expressed that Ger
many will take possession of Margarita
Island. That would be considered by the
United States a violation of the Monroe
doctrine, and Germany is not prepared at
this time to take a step which might lead
to war. It is believed in well-informed
circles here that the supposition that a
colony of Germans will be established on
Margarita Island will be the action taken
at this time. It will be the duty of these
Germans to Improve the harbor selected
by the officers of the Veneta,' which will
be useful in case of trouble.
Naval officials do not want war with
Germany, and they believe that it can
be avoided by augmenting the fleet so
as to keep it as strong as that of Ger
many. If Margarita Island should be
available for use as a base of operations
a naval officer who discussed the matter
to-day said that Germany would control
Venezuela and the Caribbean mouth of
the canal, as Margarita" is closer to the
isthmus than the United States. From
his point of view there, is no necessity of
placing American Interests in Jeopardy.
If Congress will authorize the construc
tion of a sufficient number of battleships
to enable the United States to keep pace
with German naval construction the Mon
roe doctrine, in his opinion, which most
â¢of his colleagues share, would be peace
fully maintained.

SAN JOSE, May 1. â Charles Frank
lin Crill and James C. Dunham are
not one and the same person; this
is the conclusion of most of the
people of San Jose to-night. While
the two resemble one another enough to
be twins, the preponderance of evidence
is against the prisoner being the Campbell
murderer. The Identification of Crill as
Dunham has illustrated one thing, and
that Is that Dunham was very little
known In San Jose. It is possible that If
the real murderer were brought to this
city not enough witnesses could be found
to go upon the stand and prove he was
Dunham.
The murderer lived within himself; his
whole life has proved a mystery to those
who tried to unravel the events of his
career prior to the murders. He made
few friends, went about his own affairs
and kept his secrets to himself. When it
came to getting a description of Dunham
the officers found little to work upon. .
Many had a passing acquaintance, but
few knew him intimately. These latter
are now divided as to the identity of the
suspect.
Father Jieggio Identifies Crill.
Crill was positively identified this after
noon by Father Leggio of Santa Clara
College as a person he had married to
Dora Schreiber in Pueblo, Colo., In 1887.
This meeting of groom and celebrant was
the feature of the day. Father Leggio,
who has a detective's skill,, had read of
Crill's arrest and called to see If he was
the man at whose wedding he had of
ficiated in Colorado. Buttoning his coat
well around him to hide the cloth of his
calling and with a borrowed hat upon his
head, he met the suspect. The reverend
father skillfully carried Crill over his life
In Colorado up to his wedding there in
1887. Crill told of people he knew there:
that a certain Father Leggio had married
him to Dora Schreiber, who sang in the
choir of St. Patrick's Church. He was
asked if he would recognize the priest
who performed the ceremony, and Crill
said he probably -would not, as It was 6O
long ago, but that he was a "fine fellow"
and he had learned to like him while he
was in Pueblo. He said the marriage had
been performed In the annex to the church
and Miss Devereaux had acted as brides
maid. Questioned as to a description of
Father Leggio. Crill said he looked like
his interrogator. The borrowed hat came
off the priest' 3 head, a merry twinkle
lighted his eye and both men clasped
hands.
Wedding: Day Incidents.
From that time on, they related inci
dents that proved Crill had been married
by the Father In Pueblo. Crill was not
a Catholic, and in order to have the mar
riage performed in church a dispensation '
from the Bishop at Denver was necessary.
This was late in arriving and -the mar
riage had to be postponed from the fore
noon to the afternoon. Father Leggio
and Crill had made several trips to the
telegraph office to get this permission,
and they recalled the payment of. the 55
fee by Crill. Crill was assured his mar
riage record could be found in St. Tat-
GOES AMONG STRANGERS
TO CLOSE HIS CAREER
San Diego Suicide Hides All Evi
dence by Which He, Could Be
Identified.
SAN DIEGO, May 1.â An unknown sui
cide occupies a slab at the Morgue," and as
the young man seems to have carefully
destroyed every chance of identification
and came to a city where he was an en
tire stranger to take his life, it Is <julte
likely that his Identity will not be known
unless discovered by accident. The body
was found in a room at the Santa Rosa
Hotel, vrhich the unfortunate had occu
pied during the night. It 'was lying in
front of. a mirror, before which the
stranger had stood when he shot himself.
The suicide was only about 24 years of
age and he evidently came from Los An
geles by the evening train yesterday.
When told to-night that The Call had
dispatches showing that two women
claimed to be his wives, he appeared much
disconcerted. He declared that he sepa
rated from his first wife in Pueblo in 1893.
He obtained a. divorce In Salt Lake in 1897
and the same year married at 'Salt Lake
the woman now in Fort Scott, Kans. He
said he brought suit suit for divorce, but
refused to divulge the grounds. He re
fused to talk about his wives.

Two Women Claim, to Be Wives of
*"UÂ±iT bltu.lt, Jttans., May 1.â xnere
seems no doubt that the Dunham suspect
now in jail at San Jose is the same per
son who for the past five months had
made this city his headquarters and who
Is known here as Charles F. Crill. Mrs.
C. F. Crill Is now at the Huntington Hotel
in this city, where she has resided since
last December. Yesterday she gave birth
to a baby and is In a very critical con
dition and the physicians will not allow
her to be seen by any one.
Mrs. Crill received a letter from her
husband to-day. The letter was written
on the train between La Junta and Trini
dad, Colo. It spoke of his going to San
Jose and San Francisco, but did not in
timate that he was under arrest, and it
is known that Bhe knows nothing of it.
Since his arrival here Crill had been in
the business of establishing magazine
clubs in the smaller neighboring cities
and has been away from here most of the
time, although his wife has been at the
hotel continually. Crill left here six
weeks ago for Wichita, where he was ar
rested. This is the longest he has been
away from his wife since they arrived
here. Nothing can be learned about him
previous to his arrival in this city, ex
cept that the landlady at the hotel had
heard Mrs: Crill speak about being in
Utah and the West.
- CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., May 1.â Mrs.
D. B. Crill lives at 223 North Second
street in this city with her father, Michael
Schreiber. Her brothers, L. and C. M.
Schreiber, are music dealers at 117 North
Third street. Mr. and Mrs. Crill have
been separated since 1894, the family at
that time living in Pueblo. Crill was con
sidered a worthless sort of a fellow and
failed to provide for his wife's support.
Of his whereabouts since the separation
she and her family knew little, but they
have had no word of his having been in
California. The first of the present year
he was living in Wichita, Kans., which
has-been his home practically since the
separation, so far .as his people here
know. Â¦ ..-:-;-..-.;
KNEW THE UNCLE OE CRILL.
San Franciscan Substantiates Fart of
the Suspect's 'Story. ' ;
William Myer. who resides at 1528^
Howard street in this city, has come for
ward to substantiate part of C. P. Crill's
statement in regard to his past life. Crill
claims to have had an uncle, David R.
Crill, living at Flag Station, between
Rockford and ,Rochelle, in Ogle County,
111., with whom he asserts he went to
live when he was IS years of age. William
Myer claims to have resided at Flag Sta
tion seventeen years ago and says that
he knew David R. Crill. It is not known
whether David. R. Crill still resides at
Ogle. .":'"
would say the suspect was Dunham. Â¦
H. L. Miller, the stationer, who knew
Dunham, and positively identified the man
last night as the McGlincy murderer, ad
heres to his belief. He says- he is sat
isfied the man under arrest Is Dunham,
and nothing can change his view.
Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Theurkauf, In whose
family Dunham had lived for several
years, were" sure the prisoner was not
Dunham. Mrs. Maginnis. with whom
Dunham took dinner two days before the
commission of his crime, declare he was
not the man.
Practically a Free Man.
While Crill is still detained at the Coun
ty Jail, he is practically no longer a pris
oner. He enjoys the freedom of the place
and walks about at liberty. The Sheriff's
office, while making no admission, seemed
convinced to-night it had the wrong man.
In a day or two more he will be given his
freedom. . ,
If ever James C Dunham had a double,
Crill is that man. Sheriff Langford' is
being commended for bringing back one
who so closely resembles Dunham for the
people to form their own judgment.
E. F. Greiner, who caused Grill's arrest,
Is heaping abuse upon the heads of the
people, who, he declares, do not want
Durham arrested. He still believes he
has the right man. Crill emphatically de
nies that he ever made a confession to
Greiner, whom he denounces as a liar and
a perjurer. He believes Greiner was
tempted by the big reward offered and
hoped to palm him off as the real Dun
ham in the great excitement which he
thought would prevail here over the ar
rest Greiner put up the money to bring
himself and Crill to San Jose and he has
given Sheriff Langford an assurance that
he would pay Crill's expenses home If it
was proved Crill was not Dunham. While
Langford and Deputy Bache felt certain
the man was Dunham, they did not feel
like Incurring the expense to the county
without further proof.
Declares Crill Confessed.
"The man arrested is 1 Jim Dunham,"
said Greiner to-day. IT have positive
proof, but the- people seem bent on turn
ing this man loose. Without any inves
tigation they declare he is not the man.
Some who make this assertion have never
taken the trouble to go and see him. I
don't believe the people want to punish
Jim Dunham. I have been to great ex
pense in bringing the man here, and if
they turn him loose I must furnish him a
ticket back to Kansas. He has admitted
repeatedly to me that he is no ether than
Dunham. The changes in his appear
ance can easily be accounted for. : The
fellow always carries a bottle of dye with
him and this he used regularly on his hair
and mustache. He is continually pulling
his mustache out straight and this ac
counts for the change In that respect.
Dunham's mustache formerly drooped.
Why, Crill admitted to me that he had an
operation performed In his eyes: that is,
the corner Had been cut so that they
would be opened wider and that the droop
that is mentioned could not be used to
identify him. And, then, how about the
ecar on his neck and those blunt thumbs,
and then there is the crook In his nose.
"I intend to see that I get fair play in
this matter and that the man is not
turned loose until more evidence is ad
duced." Â¦ Â¦ " - "
Greiner for a number of years was Mar
shal of Burlington, Iowa, and claims that
with his former experience he is not liable
to have made a mistake. Greiner says

FUGITIVE MURDERER OF THE McGLINCTS, HIS DOUBLE AND THE KAN
SAS OFFICIAL UPON WHOSE INFORMATION THE SUSPECT WAS
MADE A PRISONER AND BROUGHT TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY JAIL.
Special Dispatch to The. Call.
SEATTLE, May Lâ Nome papers of date
as late as February 20, received to-day,
add one name, that of Benjamin L. Miller,
a well known Seattle man, who was the
Recorder in the Aglapan district, to the
list of those known to have perished In
the recent Nome blizzard.
Charles E. Gay, brother of United States
District Attorney Gay of . this city, and
United States Commissioner for the Arc
tic district, was found badly frozen, and,
according to. last reports, was likely to
die* before medical aid could reach him.
The report of Miller's death camo to
Nome on February 18. With a man named
Thomas, Miller had left the Agiapuk vil
lago for the headwaters of the river of
the same name on January 20. A medi
cine man of the village was their guide.
About ten days later news was brought
into Teller by a native that Miller's
frozen body had been found on the river.
Miller's widow "Is at Nome with her
father. His parents reside lii this city.
Prior to : going to Nome he was well
known all along the coast as a marine en
gineer. â¢ ..
The report of the freezing of Judge Gay
was brought to Teller by a reindeer driv
er. He said that Gay was inland about
100 miles,'' with both feet badly frozen, and
that he might die before medical aid could
reach him. The man advised against the
sending out of any relief party at the
time, on account of the severe weather.
Mr. Gay has been identified with Cap
tain Tuttle of. the Bear and Sol G. Simp
son and others of this city in the Lost mine
of that district. He is a pioneer in that
section and was appointed United States
Commissioner by Judge Noyes last sum
mer. It is believed- that he was absent
from his quarters at the time on business
connected with the company. He had in
tended to come out this winter to visit
his relatives In this city, and the failure
on their part to hear from him in the last
malls aroused fears for his safety.
The storm appears to have raged from
the middle of January into the month of
February. Many were frozen so badly
that they will lose . fingers and toes, but
the list of deaths will not be laree.
On February 10, in the Solomon River
country, the snow was ten feet deep on a
level and drifted badly. Wood was scarce
e.t that time and many cases of suffering
were reported. Harry O'Neill and Adam
Sneider of Teller City were caught in a
blizzard during the early part of February
while returning from Marys Igloo with a
team of horses belonging to Charles Lane.
Both men had to suffer amputations of

of Nome was seriously frozen while on
his way from Unalakllk to Shakf olik. He
had a native boy as a guide. The boy be
came exhausted and the priest wrapped
him in a blanket and put him on the sled.
By the time he reached his destination the
good man was suffering severely. His
face was a â¢ horrible | sight, having, been
frozen solid by the biting wind. Only
slight hopes are entertained for his re

Diseases and
yj Weakness ot
fW/J MEN ONLY 1
IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF GENERAL
debility, and convalescence following certain
diseases, such la tbe lowered standard of thÂ«
vital processes that tha function of no organ U
perfectly performed, and with the resulting de-j
pre:>slon tbe patient has a REAL, weakness.'
The physician's first thought, under these con-
ditions, 13 nerve and other tonics. Â«
Not Weakness ; Symptoms
By far tha greater number of patient*, how-
ever, seeking? relief for so-called "Weakness"
Is furnished by healthy and robust men. On
examination, we find a Prostate Gland which
has been damaged by either a contracted dis-
order or early dissipation. . These patlecta
have no weakness at all. Prematureness. Los*
of Vitality, etc.. are the symptoms, or disor-
dered function, of the chronically Inflamed
prostate gland. We find by curing this inflam-
mation that full vigor at once returns. It
should be understood that tonics, electricity,
etc.. might cure a real weakness, but would do
harm In Inflammation. - The main object Is to
reduce the size of the tender, swollen and In-
flamed prostate. This we accomplish by local
treatment, thus avoiding drugs. Men who havi
unsuccessfully treated for/ a weakness shoul 1
bow understand the cans* of failure.

Ho-w Peruna Quickly Cures Back-
ache, the Bane of Womankind.
MRS. G. W. HEARD, Hempstead,
Tex., writes:
"We have moved recently, and I
must have lifted something that .was too
heavy for me In straightening things up,"
for I had such a backache and could hard-
ly stand on my feet at all. Besides, I was
so tired all the time. My face was
Spotted and I was very thin. I took one
bottle of Peruna and was soon real well.
When I feel tired and all run down I
take Peruna and feel all right before I
finish one bottle. : I know It is a won-
derful medicine, and both myself and hus-
band praise Peruna.
"There has been a great deal of sick-
ness through this part of the country,
but thanks to Peruna, which we use
freely, our own family has escaped with
almost no sickness at all.
"Could you but see our baby Ruby (to
whom we gave Peruna for bowel trouble)
you would see from her robust looks that
you need no better advertisement in this
little town. She is so fat and rosy, is
nearly nye years old now, and is a great
believer in Peruna."â Mrs. G. W. Heard.
Given Up to Dieâ All Doctors Failed.
It Pro-vxti to Be Catarrh of Stomach
and "Was Cured by Peruna.
W. A. Mitchell, dealer In general mer-
chandise, of Martin. Ga., writes:
"I- wrotÂ« you some time ago concern-
Ing my wife's case. Se had tried all of
the best doctors, and we got to where
we thought all they did was against her.
She weighed about 190 pounds when she
was In good health. When she com-
menced with our family physician in
April, 189S, she weighed about 130, but
kept going down all the time.* She went
to Atlanta, Ga., and took treatment, but
it did her no good. Then she went to
Harmony Grove, Ga., and took treat-
ment from the best physician there for
three months. She kept going down un-
der his treatment, although he was con-
sidered the best physician in the county.
She went down from 130 pounds to 68, and
we saw she could not live long. She was
a skeleton. We consulted an old physi-
cian who told her to use Peruna. She
gradually improved and got stronger. She
has gained 38 pounds since she has taken
Peruna and is gaining every day and does
her own housework.
"She -was well known when, she was
so low, and now everybody wants to
know what cured her. She had Indiges-
tion and catarrh of the stomach. It is
as good for children as for grown peo-
ple. "We haven't had to have a doctor
for one of our children since 1898." â W. A.
Mitchell.
Address Dr. Hartman, President of
The Hartman Sanitarium, Columbus,
Ohio.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the usÂ© of Peruna,
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving: a
full statement of your case, and he -win
be pleased to give you his valuable ad-
vice gratia.
Miss Rose Cullen, President Young "Woman's Club of Butte. Mont., writes
from 921 Galena, street, as follows:
"Peruna has many friends in Butte. I cannot say too much in praise
of it. While finishing school I became very nervous and exhausted from
over-study. I was weak and sick, and could neither eat, sleep, nor enjoy
life. A couple of bottles of Peruna put new life in me. I find that having
it in the house and taking a dose off and on keeps me in fine health.
"A large number of my friends place Peruna at the head of all
medicines." â Hiss Rose Cullen.

On May 30 Emin Pasha would have been
seven years old. He was presented to J.
H. Rosseter by Colonel North, the nitrate
king. When a sapling and a puppy Emln
Pasha won all-aged stakes. Up to Janu
ary 1, 1896, this great hound was defeated
but once. At that time his leg was
broken. Shortly after this Emin Pasha
was bred to Rocliette and the litter made
famous stake-winners â Rosette, Cavalier
Zoe, Theron, Maud 8 and McKinley
In the second litter were Koolawn, Valley
Queen and Mira Monte.
Emin Pasha ran in the first and last
American Waterloo stakes, dividing thÂ«
honors in the last with May Queen at
l>allas in 1899. Entfn Pasha's get includes
Palo AJto, Ireland, Erin. Uttle Sister Sir
Pasha, Slsquoc, Lady Clair, Roman Ath
lete and Recording- Angel, all of them
many times stake-winners.
. Emin Pasha, the greatest of all stud
greyhounds, is dead, pneumonia being the
cause. He was the most valuable dog in
J. H. Rosseter's kennels and sired more
stake-winners than any hound, domestic
or imported.

Beaten the day before, Wallenstein ap
peared to better advantage in the seven
furlohg run, decided under selling condi
tions. Hlndoonet had been touted as a
walk for this number, but acted sour and
sulky, dropping in a poor third. Wallen
stein, an. 8 to 1 chance, jumped away in
the lead, and because of the rickety hand
ling Ostler Joe received from Enos was
enabled to land by a neck.
Wyoming, winner of the mile and fifty
yard run, was a far better horse than on
Monday," when he finished beyond the
money. "Chub" Russell also guided him
with' more judgment, arriving at the wire
a head in advance of Gauntlet, the favor
ite. Pat Morrissey led for three-quarters
of the distance, when he had enough.
Nothing of late that Flamero has done
would justify the backing he received to
.win the last race, especially as the geld
ing was packing 121 pounds. He went to
the post favorite and ran unplaced. When
Ranseh on Dunfree to all appearnces had
the purse up his sleeve High Hoe, piloted
by Russell, slipped along, getting the de
cision by a head. Hungarian ran out in
the stretch, but for which he might have
won. .
Three or four books handled Wardman
as if the colt. had broken a leg in the
speculation on the mile purse run. Ransch
had the mount, and the three-year-old
after making all the pace led Phil Archi
bald over the mark by three lengths. Dar
lene, the backed one, finished a moderate
third. .;
After knocking at the door on several
occasions in the past. The Gafflr at last
had his number rung up. The Uncas geld
ing, with Bassinger up, was 6 to 1 in the
betting on the first event, a six furlong
sprint for maidens, and won all the way.
Triple Cross finished second but was dis
qualified for swerving, which gave the
place to La Calma and the show to
Scotch.
Â¦ Of all .the dumps none occasioned more
-surprise than, did the defeat of- Glenden
ningfor the four and a half furlong two
year-old dash by Louwelsea. With St.
Phillipplna out of the way, the former
looked like easy money and fell in for
rugged backing at 9 to 20. Leading to the
paddock, he was there collared and beaten
out almost handily by the'Doble & Co.
entry, superbly rated and ridden by Marty
Bergen. The winner closed at odds of 9
to 2. San Lution ran a fair third.
ern, the dapper Brooklyn boy,
attracted quite as much attention as did
the horses at Oakland track yesterday.
Terry swung a few left-handed "tens" at
the ring, quitting with honors about even,
but the hot ones passed up to Manager
Sam Harris caused frequent references to
Jack Gleason's "dope" book. It happened
to be one of those- afternoons when the
favorites were not at home, Wardman be
ing the only one to put his name down for
a purse. The track was very heavy and
inclined to be holding, which accounted
for the upsets, in a measure." "

Matches of the Immediate
Future in Which Terry
Figures.
Terry Mcpovern promenaded do-wn
Market street early yesterday morning-
He had on his best clothes, wore his hap
piest smile and gave the glad right that
did the trick to every friend who stopped
him to pour congratulations into his ear.
He was certainly happy and like a boy
out of school made the best of the first
day of his vacation. Â¦ - Â¦
After the fight on Tuesday evening.
while Manager Sam Harris was busy
counting up the money, Terry and Danny
Dougherty went right to bed like good
little boys. Dougherty is very sore at
heart over the "faux pas of the referee,"
as Joe Humphreys will persist in calling
it, only Joe will have it sound no other
than fox pass. Terry tried to console the
bantam by telling him that he would chal
lenge the referee. Dougherty would waive
that formality by acting for himself if he
got the chance. , ,
Poor Oscar Gardner, the: little old man.
considered the greatest in his class out
side of Terry, drifted about yesterday. A
frank admission of unquestioned defeat
was on his tongue. "I got it and plenty
of it," said Gardner with a sad smile that
reflected his inward feelings. Gardner, as
a salve to his wounds, received $1250 for
his gameness, Terry making $3750 for his
share of the proceedings. Those are the
announced figures of the club. Gardner
floated about town, while Terry crossed
the bay and tried to do a more difficult
thing than defeat Gardnerâ pick winners.
Last night he and Sam Harris left for
Bakersfield to referee the Trimble fight.
Terry has a fight with Herrera, which
will take place some time this month,
either in Fresno or Bakersfield. He will
rest for a while and then do light train
ing to condition himself.
On Friday Harris promises to give
Frank Erne a decided answer whether or
not he will match McGovern with him.
Erne and Harris will meet then in this
city.

The Walters' Alliance headquarters were
established at 927 Mission street. All day
long a throng of workers reported to the
executive committee, that was continu
ously .in session. Candidates for places
were sworn in by the officers in charge,
and as each one took the oath of allegi
ance to the union, a district was assigned.
.When the; restaurant men met in the
evening, each ; one reported the condition
of aJtairs, but these affairs were not ex

employment at the employment bureau at
12< Mason street. Only three of these
were union men. who, it is said, were

About 2100 or more waiters are out on

the principal restaurants. There were men

equally as vociferous as their mc!e com

In one respect the Beaumont,' Tex., oil field
seems destined to be beneficial to California.
There is no disguising the fact that thÂ» best
interest of . the oil industry"' in this State Is
in the direction of .contracting new develop
ments until the oil marl!:t has had tfme to
adjust Itself to the expanded production. There
'is reason to believe that tke demand will soon
rise to ' meet tlte supply.' and ; the actua) pro
ducers of oil in California ean look with equa
nimity on any condition which wia teave the
industry in this State quiescent until the ad
justment, of the , market ;. has been realized.
There Is now eo great a quantity Â»f demon
strated land that there will be no question of
the possibility of raising . the , output at any
tiroe^ ' But the temporary condition of the mar
ket calls for a . reduction of developments in
known fields. Meanwhile the wildcatter is at
work spying out fields for -future development
and nothing will or rfconld stay his band for
years to come, as the field for steady develop
meat pf markets is almost boundless. .

nresent condition of the oil market In
(California hopefully and says: .

The destiny of oil- as fuel seems to be
that It Â¦will supplant coal In several locali
ties. Half a dozen inventors are at work
in thiÂ» State trying to perfect a method
that -will make fuel oil a possibility in
cook stoves and ranges, and this, when
accomplished, will have wide reaching ef
fects not only upon the oil industry of the
coast directly but also an equal reflex ef
fect upon the coal mines. The same gen
eral condition has been wrought in Texas
as In Cdlifornia by the large discoveries
of fuel oil. The annual importation of
coal into Gal veston alone is estimated at
300,000 tens. Four barrels of the Corsicana
oil are estimated to be equal to a ton o
coal that costs $4. The four barrels of oil
can be bought for $1 72. The wholesale
coal business of Texas has already mani
fested symptoms of demoralization, and
each new gusher adds to the certainty
that the new fuel is to be preferred. â¢
There is no cessation in the incorpora-*
tion of oil companies to do business in
California. Notwithstanding the legisla
tion that was adopted 'at Sacramento at
the last session to persuade the oil men
to make California the basis of their op
erations,* Arizona is doingr a land office
business. in the issuance of articles of in
corporation of oil companies. Of the re
cently formed corporations few are capi
talized up to the million dollar-mark.- The
average figure Is about' $500,000 per com
pany. .The largest total capital authorized
m Arizona for one concern recently was
in the case of the Southern Oil Company,
the capital stock of . which is fixed at
$2,50O,0uo. There is also a recent $2,000,Gw
company, the May Queen Oil Company.
One Texas company beats all records by
fixing its capital stock at $11,000,000.
. VfcTV of Texas Boomars.
The Oil City Derrick figures out as fol
lows what must be done that a $1,000,000
Texas company -may make an income:
If Texas oil brins3 20 cents a barrel, when
the field is further developed, this lease will
have . to produce 5.0C0.C0O barrels of oil to pay
back its original capital. If ten wells are
drilled en the lease, each well will have to
make 500,000 barrels of oil to realize the ex
pectation of the company's shareholders. Now
the Bradford field was one of the richest ever
struck In the United States. Some of the best
territory- in that section sold at WOO an acre
in fee when certain to produce oil In paying
quantities, and JltCO an acre was regarded as
an extravagant price for the very best the
field afforded. Large quantities of territory
-changed hands at $U'O an acre and an eighth
royalty. -If ' the people delight In being hum
buesed, they can find abundant satisfaction in
the purchase of stock in Beaumont oil com
panies. ' It is issued, in unlimited quantities,
and there Is no danger but that there will
be enough to , go Â¦ around. . Of course, some
basis must be had for the extravagant claims
of the pushing promoters of these stock com
panies, and Ueaumont can be relied on to fur
,nlEh a full-sized sensation ever so often that
is bound ..to keep things booming. There are.
half a" dozen or more gushers now in the Beau
mont field, . any one of . which is sufficient to
more than supply twice as much of the crude
product as the Southwest will need for a long
time. to ccme. \
A significant find has been made on sec
tion 30, 2S, 23,- in the Kern River field,
which section was claimed by the scrip
pern. The report is that twenty-eight feet
of oil sand, has been encountered, - which

SENATORIAL DEBATE.
AT. a meeting of the Massachusetts Board . of
Trade last week Senator Hoar made an ad
dress which, if correctly reported in the sum
mary given in our Boston exchanges, was not alto
gether fair to the West. The theme of the speech
was "Senatorial Debate," and the "argument was to
the effect that some system should be provided- for
putting an end to prolonged discussion. In that con
clusion the country generally will .agree/ but; in
making his argument the Senator is reported to' have
charged Western Senators with interfering with the
progress of business by excessive speaking. One re^
port says: "He alluded to the fact that some eight
or ten new. States had recently been admitted which
are inferior in wealth, importance and intellect to a
single Massachusetts ccivnty. They- had sent men to
Congress to represent them who are undesirable and
unfit, and yet their votes count."
It would be easy to pick out certain Senators from
the West whose course in Congress affords some
ground for Senator : Hoar's statement, but nothing
like a sufficient number of such Senators can be found
to justify his sweeping condemnation of "eight or
ten Western States." It is known that Carter of
Montana talked the rive- and harbor bill to death, and
that the election of Clark to the Senate is in no way
creditable either to the Senate or to the State that
sends him there. When all such^facts are conceded,
however, ahere remain good grounds for objecting
to. the Senator's statements.
It is not from the West only that long-winded talk
eis enter the Senate. Hoar is, himself a long debateY
when he gets started. His speech on the administra
tion policy, in the Philippines contains something like
56,000 words. Morgan of Alabama is hot a Western
man, but he also is, about as much of a talker as any
one in the Senate. Furthermore, there have been and
are now in the Senate members from Eastern States
whose elections, if not, so. gaudy, as that of Clark of
Montana, are none the less suspected of having been'
worked out by the same methods.
-There may be States in the West that are not so
rich as -that county of Massachusetts which contains
the city of Boston, but there is not one of them that
is not equally important, equally endowed with in-,
tellectual capacity to^ look after its own affairs, and
just as much^entitled to representation in the" Sen
ate, as the whole of.. Massachusetts. Senator. Hoar
should" not. make speeches at Board of Trade â¢meet

lit, talks about too mnny things 'tliat ain't so! .

city with .water have asked Mayor Phelanif the city is
serious in its expressed desire to own. its own water
supply. This is a fairly good indication 'that some East

.......
A BOOM FOR OLNEY.
HILL of New York and Johnson of Ohio arc
not to have the track to themselves in the
great Democratic race for the Presidential
nomination. In Massachusetts a movement has
been started to get a piace for Olney, and there are
sanguine men in Boston who believe that, despite the
advanced age of their favorite, he can beat the other
two and win out in the national convention.
According to his friends Mr. Olney is by all odds
the strongest Democrat in sight. Among the points
they cite as evidences of his availability are his posi
tion in favor of tariff reform and sound money, his
support of Bryan. during the last campaign on the
so-called issue of imperialism, and the ability with
which he conducted the foreign affairs of the Gov
ernment when holding the office of Secretary of State.
It is asserted his record on the money question will
bring back to the party ranks all the conservatives
who bolted the Chicago platform, that his later sup
port of Bryan will win the radicals and Populists, and
that his summary action in bringing Great Britain to
consent to arbitrate tha Venezuelan controversy will
rally to him all the jingoes; so that if he will announce
himself now as a candidate popular sentiment in his
favor will grow so fast that by the time the Presi
dential convention meets there will be' nothing for the
delegates to do but to ratify the choice of the people
and nominate Olney bv acclamation.
A claim- of that kind looks fairly well on paper,
but it is safe to say if the boom ever gets well started
George Fred Williams, who has attained something
like a dictatorship of Massachusetts' Democracy un
der the Bryan regime, will proceed* to dissipate it.
Williams can have no Presidential aspirations for
himself, but he has .1 hearty desire to continue boss
cf the party. in his State, and he is not going to sit
around idle and let the conservative reorganizers get
control of everything that is left of the machine after
the wreck of last year. :
In the meantime Bryan himself is not watching the
fight with any considerable amount of philosophy. He
has indeed announced that he is not a candidate for
lenomination, brut the announcement was made in a
manner which implies that retirement means for him
more of bitterness than of sweet repose. In. a re
cent number of the Commoner he said: "The reor
gani*ers seem to be more concerned about winning
than they are about the platform. In view of the fact
that they suffered a : crtishing defeat the last time they
controlled a Congressional campaign and secured less
than 40 per cent of th2 votes in St. Louis at the re
cent city election, it might be well for them, to con
sider the suggestion made by a Baltimore Democrat.
He says that, if winning is the only thing to be con
sidered, our party might make victory certain by in
dorsing the Republican ticket in the next campaign.
If principles are immaterial, this plan ought to be ac
ceptable to the so-called 'conservative' element. It
would also have been advantageous in avoiding the:
'excitement' ..which the 'business interests'^com
plain of." Â¦
It will be seen there is danger ahead for the Olney.;
WE might be warranted in concluding that
there is" an element of prejudice in the advo
cates of municipal ownership of public ser
vice industries. The n:ain argument for municipal
ownership of a water supply is its greater cheapness
to the ratepayer. To stimulate inquiry and convey
some information that seemed to be needed we called
attention to the power of a municipality to compel
the purification of a corporate water supply so as to
render it fit and safe for potable use at all times, and
showed that in the case of five of our largest cities
which own their water works the supply is . non
potable and so dangerous that the ratepayers pe
riodically resort to other sources, at considerable ex
pense, for their supply cf drinking water. Of course
such a condition means that the usual inadequacy of
public administration of purely business affairs is pro
jected into the administration of a water supply. The
people, who are the municipality, are quick to use
their power to compel n private corporation to spend
all the money necessary to purify its water supply.
But the representatives of the people, their Mayor and
Council, mindful of the advantage to a politician of a
record for economy, are slow to impose taxes for the
purification of a municipal water supply. How slow,
or how inefficient, let the long, experience of Chicago,
Philadelphia, New York and other cities testify.
Now all this seems to us a most reasonable state
ment of facts that are within the knowledge of all in
telligent observers, but here comes the Oakland En
quirer saying: ' Â¦
"The San Francisco Call, which has been arguing
that municipal water supplies are unwholesome, be
cause people do not hold city governments up to the
same standard which they exact of private corpora
tions, is respectfully invited to consider the case of
New Haven, which is the latest one to attract gen
eral attention. New Haven is one of the few remain
ipg cities of its class which does not own its water
works, and on account of the impure water supplied
by a corporation there has just been a very serious
epidemic of typhoid fever. Four hundred cases *bf
the "disease have been reported, and the manner in
which the germs found their way into the pipes has
been established. The pretense that private water sup
plies are better than public ones is preposterous."
The condition of the water of. New Haven, being
as bad as that of some cities under municipal owner
ship, will not wait as long for correction because the
people of New Haven can compel the corporation
owning the supply to purify it without waiting to
overcome the inertia cf government. The mere fact
of ownership does not make water-good nor bad, nor
do we know of any orte who pretends that it does.
Bn* the' fact remains that the power to compel a cor
porate supply to be made good is everywhere stronger
than the power to purity a municipal supply. The
brightest minds enlisted on the. side of municipal
ownership freely concede" this and declare that such
ownership must uplift and reform municipal govern
ment throughout, or it will be a dangerous experi
ment. We are not aware that such ownership an(J the
uplifting and refinement pf municipal government
have been in active partnership in Chicago, Philadel
phia, New York or even Boston. An individual is
often made a better Â«'i3n and strongerTjy increasing
his responsibilities, but we arc not sure that it is so
with government. Perhaps that is why all students
of the science of gov-rmrent agree that the fewer the
things trusted to government to do the better for the
governed. â¢

QUR Eastern contemporaries are just ; now
showing to the' world 'one. of .the sweetest
uses of gentle journalism. Like ministering
mothers " they come to' their " readers morning
after morning with words, of comfort and cheer to
brighten as far as possible the gloom of dreary days
of rain. It appears ; the . situation' v is serious.
For weeks the residents of the country on the At
lantic coast from Maine to Maryland have - had
hardly more than fleeting glimpses of the sun. Com
plaints about the weather, roasts of the weather
bureau,' satire and sarcasm directed at the sky, have
ceased to entertain, an'l even swearing seems no
longer able to satisfy the sodden spirits. of the people.
Recognizing its responsibility to the public in such
a period of clouds above and mud below, the press
has bravely undertaken to cheer the multitude.
The Springfield Republican, after, admitting that
during the month of April up'l'o the 26th, the day
of 'publication, there had been but two days in
which' the sun was visible from rising to /setting,' and
that of the total number; of 'hours during which the
sun was above the. horizon 80 per cent were cloudy,
went on to say: "The old almanacs, however, tell of
worse Aprils than this, or that of 1874., One was in
1852, when the rainfall. fo- the month, as registered at
Worcester, amounted to 10.77 inches, â¢ which pre
sumably includes ajrecorded snowfall of twenty-three
inches. Those storms, were also widespread^ and it
is recorded that the. Potomac River at Washington
rose a foot above the high water mark of 1847, when
the water. was higher than it had been since 1784."
Â¦ The Baltimore American also seeks to cheer, up the
sufferers by reminding- them that worse times -have
been than those, that now are. It says: "There is a
tendency to exaggerate the rainfall of. the present
month. It has been exceptional, though not unpre
cedented. In the spring of 1859 it rained in this State
for thirty-nine days. It did not rain all the time, but
it rained every day,, calling to-. ; mind the 'â¢. definition
given by a resident of the Isthmus~"6f Panama of the
difference between the rainy and the dry seasons. " ; In
the dry season,. he said, it rained every day, while in
the rainy season it rained all the time. The spring
of 1859 was like the dry season on the isthmus."
Telling gloomy people that "things have been
worse" has, as we all know, a cheering influence.
Misery loves company. -There is a satisfaction- ,in
knowing that some one- has had 1 worse luck than
ourselves. Â¦ Doubtless' many a rain-soaked citizen' of
Massachusetts or of Maryland was consoled some
what by the information thus given by his newspaper
that things had beeh wetter in 1859 and 1852.. The
best consolers, however, are those who sing sweet
songs, and so the Boston Herald recalls the verse of
Riley:
It ain't no' use to grumble and complain; :
It's jest as cheap and easy, to rejoice;
When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,
. W'y, rain's my choice. ,
The Philadelphia Public Ledger sings no lyric
song, but seeks the saire end by didactic verse. It
says: "Though the weather for some time has .been,
generally speaking, awfully, horribly, nastily; '.windily,
rainily, dreadfully dark,' damp, doleful and disagree
able, we have determined that we shall not '^mention
the mean, miserable, mortifying, subject, but govern
ourselves according to the counsels of that old nur
sery rhyme which says:
When the weather Is wet, we must not fret;
"When the weather is dry, we must not sigh;
When the weather is cold, wemust not scold;
When the weather is warm, we must not storm; .
But weather, bad or good,
Always be in a happy mood. .
It is gratifying to se; journalism making itself so
useful to the East under such trying circumstances;
but it is surprising that rot one paper among them all
has had the sense to say to its readers: "Get a move
on;' go West, where the sun shines; meet McKin
ley in California."

SOME of the greatest discoveries in physics and
mechanics Jiave been made by" accident/
Sir Isaac Newton never thought of. the law
of gravity until an, apple fell on his head and hurt
him, and set him wondering why. things 'do not fall up
instead of down. A boy who wanted" to go fishing
discovered the automatic cut-off in a steam engine by
tying on a string to, move the valves which he was
hired to move by hand. He dug 'some worms and
went to the creek and Watt's invention was perfected.
\The Democratic party has by accident discovered a
UFefor Bryan and Altgeld. It is : an accident, but may
do more for that sick and sore party than all the medi
cine prescribed by its best political physicians. These
two- leaders have been a problem. -.Indeed it will not
be exceeding the facts to say that they have been -an
affliction. They have made the party acquainted with
giief, but the acquaintance has not ripened into friend
ship. They have inoculated it with every political virus
in the country. When they brought it near death's cele
brated door they sought to revive it with transfusion
of blood from Populism. But that operation carried
into its veins scorbutic taints that were \ worse than
the 'diseases intended to be cured by the operation.
Every time they held a consultation . the patient
mcaned and moved uneasily on its cot, but was pow
erless to refuse whatever dose they mixed, be it poke
loot or black drop. At last by accident their real
utility to the party has been discovered. The only
way in which they can do it any good has been re
vealed.
The two hotly contested city elections of the year
'.vcre in Chicago and St Louis, where Harrison and
Wells were the- regular Democratic nominees for the
office of Mayor. Wells-was a Gold Democrat who
voted for McKinley in 1896 and last year. Harrison
was not identified with the Gold Democracy, but re
fused to worship with all his heart at the shrine of the
divine ratio of 16 to I.
Bryan at once went into the St. Louis campaign
against Wells and refused to go into the Chicago
campaign for Harrison, where Altgeld, representing
both Bryan and himself, openly took the field against
the regular nominee. Mr. Bryan's justly esteemed
weekly organ, the Commoner, jumped on Â¦Â¦.Wells with
all its type, sheepshank, mallet and other printing
office appliances.
It' reviled and rib-roasted him, and sought to make
him resemble thirty cents. It roorbacked and took
f-5.11 after fall out of him, in the most approved style.
Mr. Bo'an sat up nights to concoct editorial denun
ciation of him, and chewed the silver tongue which
has enchanted millions.
Meantime Altgeld took the stump against Harrison
and opened against him that celebrated cave of the
winds which has supplied the stiff breeze that has bel
lied the party sails in many a campaign.
To say that the two leaders handled red-hot pokers
for the two candidates is not to say it all. They
boasted that they would make them pay for heating
the pokers. '."..'
Result: Harrison rind Wells both elected. In jus
tice to the Republicans of the two cities it must.be
said that they could not help it. There is.no way by
which either a candidate or a party. can refuse and
drive off support, so they had to stand and take their
medicine. We are sorry for them, but they are not
to blame. They should be happy that this thing did
not happen earlier. If Bryan had been beaten at
Kansas City and he and Altgeld had opposed the
nominee of that .convention one shudders to think
what might have happened to President McKinleyv
At last these two political banshees have found their
place. They can serve their party only by opposing
it, and can hurt the opposition only by supporting it.
Remembering Mr. Bryan's campaign threat* that Â¦ he
intends to stay in politics all his life, the Republican
party needs to seriously study the situation. This
new microbe threatens to get into its blood and body.
It must study germicides and stop the peril right
where it is. .

sword, and should be handled only by
those drilled in its use.

drug habit, to which thousands are vic
tims, furnishes him no inconsiderable por
tion of his income.
Nostrum- venders ; very commonly sell
their preparations under some meaning
less or misleading name. In, many of
these compounds or mixtures alcohol,
opium, chloral, antipyrine or some other
harmful drug is introduced, and after the
victim has taken a few bottles he finds
that he does not feel well without it and
goes on binding himself In fetters which
he cannot break. Every physician of
large experience has met with cases of
this kind.
Using Medicine Ignorantly.
There is no doubt that the widespread
prevalence of the drug habit is injurious
to health and tends to shorten life. Many
chronic diseases of the digestive organs,
liver and kidneys are induced by this
habit.
_ Granted that the varied and numerous
digestants so largely employed possess
the -activity claimed for them. It would
be better in a great many instances to
improve the appetite and strengthen di
gestion by an abstemious indulgence in
the good things of the table. The best
and most rational treatment for a tired
brain or nerve is generally to be found
in rest and not in the administration of
a sedative. The best physicians recognize
these facts and reserve the prescription
of sedatives for the few cases In which
they are absolutely required. It has fallen
to the writer to treat many cases of the
opium habit in its various forms, and in
only a few instances has this most per
nicious and destructive habit had its or
igin in a physician's prescription, but I
have seen several cases that were due to
some drug advertised under some fanci
ful name. I was once consulted by an
eminent clergyman who for many years
had used a drug for his catarrh. He de
nied that he had ever taken opium and
he was honest in this statement, for he
did not know that the preparation which
he had used so long, as he thought with
much benefit, was an opiate. I once found
a lady practically starving- to death while
she was consuming bottle after bottle of
a much lauded "predigested" food, which
in reality consisted of nothing more nor
less than a grape-sugar syrup. For this
her husband was paying a dollar a bot

DEAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY, UNIVER-
Um> :' SITY OF MICHIGAN.
By Professor "Victor O. Va/iagiin,
COPYRIGHT, 1901
Notwithstanding the fact that we
Americans are' very practical people, wo
are quite credulous and the nostrum ven
der . probably flourishes nowhere else as
he does' among us. . We swallow gallons
of concoctions of various sorts prepared
by unscrupulous pretenders, many of
whom are wholly ignorant . of -. chem
istry, physiology and all other branches
of medicine. In spite of the general
good sense for which we are justly re
puted, at .the core we are filled with su
perstition and - are -"' ready ' to drink from
every cup offered us, invariably hoping
that in it we may find the elixir of life
and a panacea for our' many sills. So
eager are we in the pursuit' of wealth, so
cial position, political ambition or some
other glittering bauble that we cannot
take the time to rest our tired nerves,
and when the consequent aches and paina
goad us some hasten to the physician,
asking him to do the Impossible; while
others eagerly ! read the so-called histor
ies of wonderful cures and then proceed
to swallow bottle after bottle of some
preparation of unknown composition.-
Fortunately most of these are inert, but
this is not true at all. Many a babe has
fallen into its last sleep under the influ
ence of the medicine administered by its
mother. Some years ago I made a chem
ical examination of so-called opium cures
then. in. the market, numbering nearly a
score. All. of these, with one exception,
contained an opiate in some form; the
one exception was a solution of. common
salt in water. I -was once severely be
rated by an aged man, -who was consult
ing m#' on account of slight indigestion,
because I advised him not to take any
medicine, but\ to*, drink a little natural
wine with his Â¦ meals. He said that no
physician was justified -in prescribing
alcohol in any form, but he had already
told me, in giving the history of his
trouble, that he had taken more than a
hundred bottles of certain bitters. Now,
the wine, recommended contained not
more than 10 per cent of â¢ alcohol, while
the bitters contained more than. 50 per
cent, and, in- my opinion, were to some
extent at least responsible for the condi
tion of his stomach. This Illustrates the
wisdom and consistency practiced by
many of us. "
Testing Drugs Before Using Thein.
Many of the powders, tablets and other
preparations now so widely used for the
relief of headaches and other pains are
positively : injurious and a number of
deaths result from their employment.
The fact that no recognized ill effect fol
lows immediately after the use of a drug
do-es not prove that it has no bad effect;
indeed, the appetite may be increased and
a general tonic effect be felt under the in
fluence of a drug which is slowly causing
degenerative changes in the liver or kid
neys that can never be repaired. The
remote as Â¦iwell as the immediate effects
of drugs should be known before they are
employed in the treatment of disease.
This is the explanation of the fact that
the scientific medical man finds it neces
sary to study the action of new drugs on
the lower animals before he dares to pre
scribe them for man. It has been said
that the effects of drugs on the lower ani
mals and on man are so dissimilar that
nothing of value can be learned by sucH
experiments. This Â¦ statement is ' not
true, as every pharmacologist knows.
â¢While the different species^, of .vertebrate
animals often'show 'wide variations in the
doses necessary to produce certain ef
fects, under the full influence of the drug
the results are practically 1 the same. The
best practitioners of medicine do not em
ploy new drugs in the treatment of dis
ease until their effects upon the lower
animals, 'even in the minute -microscopical
changes, have been investigated. Every
first-class medical school \ has its phar
macological and pathological laborator
ies in which these studies are prosecuted.
Medicine for the Individual.
When the chemist has succeeded in the
preparation of some new compound which
he thinks, on account of its composition,
may be useful in the relief of pain he does
â¢not test its efficiency by administering it
to man. He gives the compound to the
pharmacologist, who carefully studies the
effects of the new drug on dogs and other
animals, observing its action on the pulse,
respiration, etc., and recording these ef
fects by means pf delicately contrived in
strument?. After completing his studies
the pharmacologist turns the animals over
to tho pathologist, â¢ who makes a most
minute search of the various organs for
any abnormal conditions that may be
present as a result of the action of the
drug. It is not until all these observa
tions i have been carefully made and - re
peated many times' that the action of the
new drug on man is tried. In this way
practically all the drugs now employed by
the regular medical profession have been
'studied. There is another point of great
importance that is closely investigated by
medical men. It is well known . that a
drugs 'that may be curative of one condi
tion'may be capable of doing great harm
in other conditions. Because a certain
remedy has proved useful and even cura
tive to one man in the treatment of pneu
monia, that is no proof that it may hot
bp. harmful to. another suffering from the
same disease. The condition of the heart
or kidneys. in one case may counter-indi
cate the use of the remedy.
It must be evident from what has been
stated that no medicine, unless it be of
the simplest and most harmless character,
should be taken except upon the prescrip
tion of a competent medical man after a
personal examination of the patient. Nev
ertheless, it is probably true that nine
tenths of the medicine taken by the peo
ple of this country is not prescribed by
physicians. Members of the regular "med
ical profession are not in the habit of
giving medicine unless it be indicated, and
many diseases are treated without any
medication. ..~ >
The Physician andthe Charlatan.
It must not be; supposed that medicines
are altogether useless or that all diseases
can be treated without them. For in
stance, malaria is caused by the presence"
of a parasite introduced Into the blood by
the bite of. a mosquito. Quinine is the
only known substance that can be intro
duced into the body in sufficient quantity
to kill the parasite. However, even in
this case the quinine must be adminis
tered at a certain time with reference to
the onset of the chill and in certaln-tlases
before it will prove effective, and a quali
fied physician, after an examination of
the patient, is the only one competent to
decide when and in what form and doses
the drug should -be. administered. The
physician must first ascertain whether or
not the disease is malaria. This he does
by a microscopical examination of the
blood, and then after acquainting hlrnself
with the history of the case he orders the
quinine to be taken at a time when it will
be effective. , 'Â¦â¢
Diphtheria Is treated with antitoxin, but
this does not indicate that < any and all
diseases are benefited by the injection of
any, kind of lymph or serum. The char
latan Is always ready to warp and twist
the discoveries of science v to his own

and . having satisfied himself of. the true I

George Gould a Heavy Buyer. j
There is good ground for believing that J
George J. Gould, as president of the Mis- [
souri Pacific and a leading director in i
the Union Pacific, has been a heavy buyer I
of the latter stock, and that by means of !
his large private holdings of stock, which ]
may later be turned over to the Missouri ;
Pacific, the latter road will, jointly with
the Northwestern and possibly the St. j
Paul, control the Union Pacific. I
The Burlington deal, however, changed
the Western situation, and the aggressive
policy of J. J. Hill and J. P. Morgan in
combining the Burlington. Northern Pa
cific and Great Northern forced the
Northwestern to prepare for future emer
gencies.
There are excellent reasons for the as
sumption that Vartderbilt has been the
largest buyer of- Union Pacific on the
great rise to nearly 130, either for his own
account, with a view to increasing his in
terest in the company, or for account of
the Chicago and Northwestern, so that
th-? latter may exercise a leading influence
in Union Pacific affairs.
There are two other railroads set down
as likely buyers of Union Pacific stock in
large amounts for the same reason that
the Northwestern wants it, namely, the
Ft. Paul and Missouri - Pacific companies.
The St. Paul Company is situated simi
larly to the Northwestern, while the Mis
souri Pacific, which is controlled abso- j
lutely by the Goulds, must also have an |
outlet to the Pacific Coast In order to ren
der its plans effective. . :
Changed by Aggressive Policy.
From sources close to Vanderbilt it ap
pears that the present management o* the
Union Pacific is not only in thorough ac
cord with that gentleman, but he has
etood ready for a long time to make a
dea' with the Chicago and Northwestern,
which the Vanderbilts control. But up to
the pcegent year of great deals Vanderoilt,
it is said, thought it was better for the
Northwestern to have several strings to
its bow rather than tie up exclusively
with the Union Pacific.
NEW YORK, May Lâ The Mail and Ex
press says: It was learned from official
eources that William K. Vanderbilt is a
large holder of Union Pacific stock
end that he acquired his holdings after
reaching a full understanding with E. H.
Harriman. Those in a position to know
assert that Harriman was placed at the
head of the road at the instance of Van
derbilt, although others declare that Har
riman is the joint .choice of W. K. Van
derbilt, George J. Gould and Kuhn, Loeb
& Co. Harriman is a close personal friend
of Vanderbilt, and was picked out to man
age the Union Pacific because he-was re
garded as an a.ble railroad man.

CHICAGO, Hay 1. â The movement of prices
and the character of trade apparently, con
firmed the previously existing belief that May
corn had been cornered,. Phillips, who has en
gineered the deal, paid cash for. 2.600,000 bush
els, . which were delivered to him on May con
tracts. Â¦ Prices, at the opening .ranged from
43c to 48%c, and .in a few minutes touched
4S',4c. Phillips hid actively to check, the de
cline reaction. Scattered shorts, alarmed by
this and further worried by. strong cabifiH,
sought to cover and bid the market up to bOc,
high price for this delivery of â¢ the 1D00 ctop,
by 11. o'clock. The bull leader sold moderately
at this price, and a sharp break to 40c followed.
May closing l'/ic higher at 49V4e. The bull party
has been a heavy buyer of July -options and
did much in' advancing that .delivery to-day.
Corn closed %<g%c higher. , . .. Â¦
An undertone of considerable strength- was
observed In "the wheat market, although' the
best prices wore not held -to the end of the
session. May was sold liberally by ' longs, but
their holdings went. to strong hands. The ad
vances tempted realizing, which accounted for
the reactions. â¢ July wheat closed V 9 @Mc higher,
May %c higher. v â¢
' The ccrn strength and the continued demand
from elevator Interests were factors In oats.
Trade ivns active throughout the day. May
oats opened at 26%@27c, and under the fright

price for the crop. | Profltrtaking caused , a re
action, but the close was strong, lc over, yester
day, at 27%c.

Mail advices from New York say: "The
feature in dried fruits yesterday was a firmer
fw-ling In currants, du-2 to a higher market in
Greece. Cables to a number of houses in the
local trade from PatrAS reported an ' advance
there cf Is 6d per cwt., equivalent to aboift
l-3c per pound. The exact cause of the im
provement is not certain. Several explana
tions were given here. One report was that
the advance was due to an Increase In buying
bT the Continent, stocks of really useful cur
rants remaining in Greece, according to one
version, bfir.g re-duc?"! to about 2000 tons. An
rtber reason advanced is that a very much
larger percentage of the vines has been in
jured by the reronofjurcs than was at first
FupposeJ. thereby reducing the estimates of
the total of the coming crop. Stocks here are
around SCCO bbls, almost all in the hands of
one hoMer. Prices had not been advanced up
ir> a late hour yesterday. Buying of currants
fc.is been light since beginning of the year,
the trade purchasing in a hand-to-mouth way
in expectation of lower prices.
New York Dried Fruit Market.
Shipments have been normal during the
month of April and foreign shippers of the
crast lumber manufacturers have reaped good
price*, especially in the ports of Australia.
Eat-tern shipments of lumber and shingles have
been good, particularly in the latter sphere,
as the spring demand for repair purposes has
developed the fact that the redwood shingle
is rising in the favor of the Eastern con
rtructors. The Newport Wharf and Lumber
Company is making strong efforts to popularize
the redwood product in the Eastern market.
lÂ»rices are not where they should be by a
lavge margin, and when charter rates and
middlemen are considered there can be but
l : t:le profit for the lumber manufacturer.

buying until the price touched 129. From. that
point the stock fell back by feverish fluctua
tions to 123 and then vibrated wildly, as
though the traders were attempting to find a
level representing some undisclosed offer for
the stock. - The violent relapse In Union Pa
cific came about the. same time as the an
nouncement of the dividend act. on Atehison.
As there have been very demonstrative claims
that this semi-annual dividend would' be 2
per cent instead of 1% per cent, there were
some disappointed . traders, who sold the stock
freely on the announcement, causing a relapse
of 3 points. The market looked at this time
as though it would lose all the advantage de
rived from, the' spurt In Union Pacific and
a large, part of the recoveries which had
reached from 13 points from the low level were
lost again. The general movement, of prices
was so erratic as to throw the speculation into
contusion, and operators refrained from taking
action, leading to practically the first period
of anything approaching dullness for the week.
In the course of the afternoon, however. Union
Pacific renewed its advance in a much more
orderly and well-sustained manner than in the.
morning, and very notable buying of Northern
Pacific supplemented thi* movement. The
I great speculative movement thereupon resumed
I full swing, the participants showing undltnin
lshed industry in seeking out new points of
strength and bringing about a general resump
tion of strength. Union Pacific's late advance
carried it up to 130, an extreme rise of i
points and New York Central touched 163%, a
gain of 5%. Northwestern gained 5% on- the
day. These advances were apparently sympa
thetic and gave color to the supposition that
â¢the Vanderbilts â¢ had I secured control of the
Union Pacific. This supposition was commonly
accepted this morning, but the violent move
ments in Union Pacific pave rise to surmise of
a renewed contest for the control of the prop
erty. There Is an appearance- of uncertainty
among the Insiders as to where the actual con
trol lies, but that a bold contest in the open
market for the control has been going en is
now an accomplished fact, and, following- upon
the accomplishment of ihe Burlington deal.
It makes the speculative public quite ready to
jump at any suggestion of a consolidation of
whatever magnitude. The conditions precipi
tated by the Burlington deal, especially when
followed by the- Union Pacific operation, give
a very logical basis for the suspicion that rival
railroad systems are in a measure in an un
protected position unless they follow with sim
ilar consolidations. The Pennsylvania dividend
was also a disappointment to the more ebul
lient class of speculators, as they had predicted
with great confidence that it would be sup
plemented by an extra dividend, but the ef
fect on the stock was very slight, as It came
after the market had fairly turned upwsrd
again. The additional engagements of $1,250,000
in gold for to-morrow's French steamer came
as a surprise, and the earlier announcement
was a large factor in the chilling influences
on the opening stock market, following is It
did . yesterday afternoon's advance to C per
cent in the call money rate. The rate ran
up to 6 per cent again to-day under thÂ« de
mand from belated borrowers, but the specu
lative contingent was not disturbed. The dis
bursements of Government Interest and of
corporation earnings incident to the first of
the month are looked to keep the present
needs of the money market supplied. There
were periods of strength to-day among the coal
ers, especially the Readings, railroads in the
Southern region, the Wabashes, Mexican Cen
tral. Baltimore and Ohio. Illinois Central,
Western Union, United States Leather, Glu
cose, People's Gas, Hocking Valley, Interna
tional Power, General Electric and a number
of minor stocks, but none of these movements
was explained by anything else than the gen
eral speculative conference. The day's busi
ness, though falling half a million shares be
low yesterday's level, was still of abnormal
proportions. The United States Steel stocks,
though continuing very active, moved very nar
rowly.
The heavy business in bonds to-da.y was large
ly accounted for by the extraordinary dealings
and price in Union Pacific convertible fours In |

A -^irge and enterprising local house Is en
gaged !n finding out the size .of the different
crops as compared with last year. All dis
tricts in the State are being closely canvassed.
In the case of Almonds every grower is sent a
printed sheet with a stamped return envelope
and requested to fill out the blank inquiries
and return. From these returns it is found
that the crop of Almonds will be 37 per cent
of last year's, ninety-two individual reports
having thus far been received. As for Prunes,
the returns will not be In for some days yet.
but Sonoma County reports less than a. third
of - last year's crop, while, ns before men
tioned, a San Jose authority, says that the
Santa Clara crop will not be over 20 per cent
of last year. Apricots are set down at about
25 per cent. Thus it will be seen that light
crops will be' the rule this year. t

The Santa Fe Railroad people reported
that they were ready to begin work on
China Basin as soon as the Harbor Com
missioners' t^iants were removed. The
secretary waÂ¥ instructed to notify all ten
ants that they must vacate at once.
At a meeting of the Harbor Commis
sioners which was held yesterday after
noon the method which is being used for
the preservation of plies came in for an
exhaustive discussion and rather Â¦ severe
criticism. The Commissioners have dis
covered that the creosote treatment which
is being administered under the existing
contracts is not sufficient to protect the
piles from the ravages of the teredoes.
They were in doubt, however, whether It
would increase the life of the pile if a
more expensive and more thorough treat
ment would be made. No definite action
was taken in regard to the matter. It
wan laid over for further discussion at
the next meetlnsr.
It was suggested that one of the pile
drivers be laid up and the work let by
contract, but no action was taken.

Archbishop Riordan. Performs the
Sacred Ceremony, Assisted by
Several Priests.
The little chapel of Sacred Heart Acad
emy was the scene of a very beautiful
and impressive service yesterday morn
ing, when Archbishop Riordan adminis
tered the rite of confirmation to twelve
pupils of the school. ' The audience ! was
limited to the- sisters in charge of the
academy and the parents of the children.
The chapel had been artistically decor
ated for the occasion with palms and
flowers and presented a most pleasing ap
pearance. Special music was rendered
during the ceremony. The little girls who
were confirmed were dressed in white and
each one carried a bunch of lilies.
Archbishop Riordan, assisted by Father
Dempsey and Father Mulligan of St.
Mary's Cathedral celebrated low mass,
hallowed by confirmation. The mass was
followed by a few words in which he set
forth to the children the sanctity of the
new obligations which they had assumed,
and asked that those present should pray
that they might always live in purity and
earnestness of heart. The services of the
morning were concluded with the exposi
tion of the blessed sacrament.
In the afternoon the children gathered
in uniform again for the benediction and
an act of consecration to the Blessed "Vir
gin, conducted by Father Dempsey. The
little ones then repeated In concert the
vows which had been taught them by tho

John Gleason in Court on the Charge
of Attacking a Guardian of the
Peace at the Fight.
The case of John Gleason, manager of
the Twentieth Century Club, charged with
battery upon Corporal Egan at the Me
chanics' Pavilion Tuesday night, was
called in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
and continued till Saturday.
There is a strong feeling of indignation
against Gleason in the Police Department
for the way in which the policemen who
were present at the pavilion Tuesday
night were treated. For nearly two hours
the officers, although they were in citi
zen's clothes, helped to keep back the
crowds, but Gleason refused to allow
them to enter until late In the evening,
when Captain Wittman, after driving a
crowd back from the doors, gave the or
der and they were admitted.
Corporal Egan was specially detailed by
Captain Seymour to look out for pick
pockets, but Gleason positively refused to
allow him inside the pavfllon and shoved
him away. The policemen say they were
Insulted, by two special officers and the
doorkeepers,
Gleason called â¢ upon Captain Seymour
yesterday morning and apologized for his
conduct, giving as an excuse that he did
not know that policemen were allowed in
side the- pavilion. Police Commissioner
Mahoney was one of those refused admit
tance and he had to pay $5 for a ticket.

PEKING, Tuesday, April 30.â Marshal
von Waldersee, in the letter which he
sent to the Ministers to-day, as the reply
of the generals to the views of the Min
isters regarding the military questions
discussed yesterday by the generals in
conference, says a garrison of 6000 men
should be left at Tientsin and the adjoin
ing district, Great Britain, France, Ger
many and Japan to contribute 1400 men
each and Italy 400 men. To garrison Shan
Hai Kwan, France, Russia, Great Britain
and Germany are to contribute 300 men
each and Italy one company until the
forts are razed. So long as any forces
occupy Chinese territory the foreign mili
tary commanders must exercise the full
authority . of a civil administration, ac
cording to the principle established at
The Hague in 18JJ9. The Chinese may re
main in office, as in the case of Paotingfu,
and, partly, Tientsin.
Besides the 6000 men in the Tientsin dis
trict, warships, which must always be in
the Peiho, will preserve communication
Vith the international fleet at Taku.
PARIS, May 1.â The Foreign Office has
received a dispatch from Peking an
nouncing that M. Plchon, the French
Minister, presented to-day the report of
the committee on indemnity. The amount
China is to pay has been fixed at 1,365,000,
000 francs. How it is proposed that the
indemnity be distributed among the pow
ers is not set forth, but as the dispatch
does not mention The Hague it is thought
the Ministers are hopeful of being able
to settle the proportion to be received
by each power by discussion at Peking.
The indemnity ligure is under what has
been expected in Paris, as it was thought
the total would reach one and a half
milliards of francs. There is much dis
appointment over the fact that the United
States is supporting England against an
increase in the customs. This is attrib
uted to the influence of the American
community in China: It is believed that
England, if alone, would yield, but fears
are entertained that England's scheme is
to prolong the negotiations until her
hands are free in South Africa, when she
would show a stronger policy in Chinese
affairs.
BERLIN", May 3.â A dispatch from
Peking, dated May 1, to the Kol

BUFFALO. May Lâ Twelve hundred
machinists in this city and probably 300
more in Erie County outside of Buffalo
struck to-day to secure a nine-hour day
without a decrease of pay. It Is under
stood that the local movement is the fore
runner, of a strike that may extend all
over the United States, Canada and Mex
ico on May 20. when a general demand for
a nine-hour day will be made.
The strike of the marine engineers is
practically settled on the basis of mutual
concessions. The Lehigh Valley Transpor
tation and the Union Steamboat compa
nies have agreed to put on the extra men
demanded on .ihe larger boats, but not on
the smaller ones. The United States Steel
Corporation is expected to come to an
agreement with the men to-morrow. It
is expected that all beats will be ready to
go into commission on the lakes in a very

placing -the . limitation at four years on

that the statute of limitations that ap
plied was.' the limitation of three years,
and that it .commenced to run immediate

Coroner's Jury Charges
Dr. Bunker With a
.Girl's Dea^h.
PLACES BLAME
UPON PHYSICIAN
The Coroner's jury that yesterday heard
the testimony as to the cause of Jane
Bouillaguet's death returned a verdict
that she came to itcr death on April 25
from blood'poisoning, following an opera
tion performed by Dr. R. E. Bunker, and
charged Dr. Bunker with murder.
The physician surrendered himself im
mediately after the verdict was rendered
and was released on giving bonds In the
sum of $10,000, with Dr. Perrault and
Charles L. Patton ao sureties.
Miss Adele Cerles was the most dam-
Eglnjr witness against the accused doctor.
She was the friend and confidant of Miss
Bduillaguet and accompanied her to Dr.
Bunker's office on April 8. The witness
stated that the doctor agreed to per
form an operation for. $15. - He suggested
the Bellevue Sanitarium at 1603 Jackson
street and the witness went thither with
her friend and paid the $15 to Miss Emma
Siddall, the head nurse. Miss Bouillaguet
told the witness a day or two later that
she had been operated upon by Dr. Bun
ker. She had told the witness also that
H. J. Ford, a conductor on the.Jackson
street line, had tried- to dissuade her from
having the operation performed and had
offered to marry, her and take' her away
from this city, but that she had refused.'
H. J. Ford, the conductor mentioned,
testified that he had kept company with
Miss Bouillag'et for about a year. ' She
told him what, her purpose was andhe
said that if she carried it out he would
not have anything more to do with her.
They had been engaged' to be married. .
Miss Emma Siddall swore that; she had
been employed by Dr. Bunker for the last
five years and , that â¢she had * been pro
pjietor of the Beilevue' Sanitarium for
two years. â¢ She. afterwards qualified her
statement by saying that at present she
was not an employe of the doctor. ."- Sha
denied that a criminal operation had been
performed upon Miss Bouillaguet.
A: " W. Martin, undertaker, admitted
very "calmly that lie had disobeyed the
orders of the Coroner by*embalming the
body without pert-mission. He 'had- done
bo because he did not , think t that there
were any suspicious circumstances con
nected with the case.
Dr. Bunker testified that he had treated
the, woman for an' abscess and that
she told him that she had been to a
woman who had treated her with elec
tricity. He was aware of the condition
of his patient. The witness . testified
further that wheii : Undertaker Martin
saw the death certificate .he. asked the
doctor to give something else than sep
ticaemia, as the cause so that it would
not be necessary to > see the Coroner
about it. â¢ â¢' . .
