MILLBRAE. Cal., March 13. General
Harrison ranked Intellectually among
the 'ablest of : our Presidents. His
conduct of his office was labori
ous and conscientious, and he was
ready when occasion required it
to assume at the same time the detail
duty of the most exacting of the depart
ments. His administration was pure, and
the country under it was prosperous. His
absorption. In .his work sometimes led to
a brusqueness of manner which was mis
construed, and those who knew him
sllshtly, or not at all. thought him cold.
Those more Intimate found him hearty
and genial, and In private life full of quick
and tender sympathies. He never forgot
a friend or a service, though hl3 critics
sometimes said that the same tenacity of
character, might occasionally make it dif
ficult for him to forget an Injury- He has
distinctly gained In public appreciation
since his retirement from office. The loss
of such a man when beyond further ambi

the greatest we could experience.

Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock
said:
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson said:
"President Harrison made a distin

who maintained the honor and prestige of
his country and whose highest ambition
was to do his duty toward and serve the
best Interests of that country."
Secretary Long said:

"The death of Mr. Harrison is a na

of extraordinary mental capacity and ac

force and value."

His death was quiet an-1 painless,
there being a general sinking un-
til the end came, which was
marked by a single R.isp for
breath .is life departed from the
b^y of the statesman. The relatives, with
a few exceptions:, and several nf the for
mer President's old and tried friend? were
at the bedside when he passed away.
The general's condition was so bad this
rrr>rr:lr.?. after a restless nfsrht. that the
attending physicians understood that the
end could not be far off, and all the bul
letins sent out from the sick room were
to this effect, so that the family and
friends were prepared when the final blow
came. The gradual failing of the re
markable strength shown by the patient
became more noticeable in the afternoon,
and a few moments before the end there
was an apparent breakdown on the part
of the sufferer as he surrendered to the
disease against which he had been brave
ly battHr.gr for so many hours. The
change was noticed by the physicians,
and the relatives and friends who had re

News of the death spread Quickly. Worj

Benjamin Harrison.
Benjamin Harrison stood for a type of
American citizenship not often seen In
these later days. Retiring at the end of
his four years' service from the highest
position that any man on earth Is called
upon to occupy, he returned to the modest
home where he had spent the greater part
of his life and resumed his duties as a
plain and unpretentious citizen. -Yet with
his name and talents he could have com
manded professional employment with
any one of several metropolitan corpora
tions bidding for the use cf his name at
any salary he might shoose to fix. Though
taking the largest interest In the policy
and acts of the Government of which he
had been the head, he meddled in noth
ing until forced by his conviction of im
pending danger to raise his voice and
point his pen in firm but vigorous protest.
He spoke with no uncertain sound and
called down upon his head the wrath of
those against whose ulterior purposes he
gave warning.
Among his addresses on the subject
those of December 14, 1900, at the Uni
versity of Michigan before 3000 students
and at the Columbia Club, New York, on
January 2 last,' were masterful exposi
tions of the correctness of his position
and are still fresh in the minds of the
public.

he denounced as unconstitutional and un-

The friendship existing between Harri
son and Stanford was very sincere ancj
lasting. It bejan In the days when the
two were in Congress together. Harrison
Invariably relied on Stanford's recom

ronage.
In 1804 Harrison was on the coast again.
This time It was to deliver his series of
lectures on International law at Stanford
University. His ability as a lecturer waa

theories. More recently his name was in

speech was no mere flourish of rhetoric.

London Newspapers Pay
Tribute to Harrison's
High Character.
LONDON, March 14.â All the morning
papers publish long memoirs of the lata
General Harrison and editorials dealing
with his career. The Daily Chronicle
says:
"It may be long before America finrt3
another President a.i capable, honorable
and conservative."
The Standard expresses the opinion that
General Harrison hns not left a deep
mark in the history of his country, but
like all the papers it pays a tribute to his
high personal character.
General Barnes was at his side all
through the evening, and was kept busy
answering the President's questions about
his fellow-diners. "Who is that man?"
asked Harrison of Barnes, indicating a
Harrison made a speech brief but suc
cinct on the current political events of the
day. and concluded gracefully in the fol
lowing words: "Right royally have you
welcomed us," with all that is rich and
prodigal In provision and display, with all
graclousness and friendliness, and I leave
my heart with you when I go."
Leaves His Heart Here.
But Mrs. Harrison made up, in her de
light at every fresh sight, for the lack of
enthusiasm in the President. Then came
the grand parade up Mferket street to the
Pavilion, where the reception was held.
There was a terrible crush, and numbers
of persons fainted.
The great banquet at the Palace Hotel
was, however, '.he most spectacular piece
of hospitality the city, extended. Two
hundred, and fifty guests sat down, num
bering all the best-known men In Siin
Francisco. His mnnner of accepting the
Invitation to it was thoroughly character
istic of Harrison. General Barnes, who
was chairman of the committee on recep
tion, attended the President with the in
vitation.
"Going to be any big speeches?" asked
Harrison".
General Barnes reassured him, and he
promised to be present. He kept his word
and made a brlMiant speech himself. A
speech which lingered long in the mem
ory of all who heard it. In the earlier
stages of the affair Harrison sat looking,
as usual, cold, uninterested and somewhat
bored. Gradually, however, he began to
thaw out. He addressed himself liberally
to his glass, and when the coffee and ci
gars were reached and he rose to respond
to the toast proposed In his honor by Gen
eral Barnes and waited till the cheers
which greeted him should have subsided
there was a geniality in his manner which
had been missed hitherto.

turned up the collar of hl3 heavy coat
and sought refugo behind the pilot
house." He spoke hardly at all on the
trip across, vouchsafing no reply to the
eager explanations of the reception com
mittee. As the boat ne'arcd the city dark
ness fell, and two rockets shot up from
the hurricane deck of the steamer. At
the same moment the guns from the
Charleston thundered out a salute, and
a red glare was cast against the sky
from the brilliantly illuminated streets.
Bonfires blazed on every elevation, and
high above them all, on the summit of
Telegraph Hill, hundreds of rockets and
roman candles added to the splendor of
the* scene. Against the brilliant back
ground the masts and rigging of the ships
swinging at anchor showed fine as an
etching. Harrison turned toward the city.
At last he spoke. "That is one of the
most beautiful sights I have seen.
Do you know, somehow those silent ves
sels remind me of phantom ships?"'
Harrison's visit to the coast gathers
particular interest from the projected ex
cursion of President McKinley. When
Harrison came here the city was not
nearly the size it is to-day, but in point
of enthusiasm it can hardly have in
creased. A mighty series of entertain
ments were prepared, and the resources
of decorators and caterers were taxed to
their uttermost, but when Harrison ar
rived he lmpresed the people as being
singularly impassive, not to say cold,
over all the preparations which had been
made for his reception. The Presidential
train pulled into Oakiand on the evening
of Saturday, April 23, and a passenger
who made the trip across the ferry with
the visitors gave at the time the follow

carrying himself in public:

His time for the next two years was al
most entirely absorbed with this impor
tant matter, and as the court sat In
Paris he was absent from home a good
part of the time. Though opposed by the
most eminent legal talent of the British
Empire, he made his case successfully,
and was paid a fee of 1150,000 for his serv

public. But a short time ago he was ap

the four American members of the Inter

In the early part of 1S9S, when the
whole country was concerned as to the
Cuban question, Mr. Harrison announced
himself as in favor of armed intervention
and lent his most cordial support to the
Government in the. subsequent prepara
tions and operations against Spain. When
the enemy was beaten, however, and the
object " f (yr which the war was under
taken, accomplished he fell out of accord
with the policy of the administration,
which began to show Imperialistic and
expansive. tendencies, and later as a Re

In the latter part of 1893 and the first
half of 1S96 Mr. Harrison's name was
widely mentioned for the Republican
nomination for the Presidency and he was
urged to make the race. The delegation
from his own State went to the national
convention at St. Louis under instruc
tions to vote solidly for him. while those
from Illinois, Ohio and other States Were
largely divided in his favor. He, however,
declined to have his name go before the
convention.' On the' nomination of Mr.
McKinley he threw his full force into the
fight for the success of the ticket, not
only stumping Indiana from tho Ohio to
Lake Michigan but making strong ad
dresses in New York City and other
strongholds of the Democracy. Durlnsr
the following year Mr. Harrison published
a. work entitled 'fThls Country of Ours,"
which made most evident the- soundness
and depth of his mind,; his ability as a
writer, and his qualities as a far-seeing
statesman. In the same year he made his
celebrated "Plea for a Better Judiciary"
and delivered other lectures, among /yhlch
were "The American Union," "Federa
tion":; and . "State Institutions," all of
which attracted much attention and were
mo?t 'favorably commented upon by the
press over the United States.
Mr. Harrison was from early life a con
sistent Christian and a member of the
Presbyterian church, in whose councils
for many years he took a prominent part
as a member of the General Assembly.
He took a most lively interest in thi ad
ministration of affairs of his native city,
and never failed to go early to the polls
nnd cast his vote for the man of his
choice.
After forty years of sweet companion
ship President Harrison lost his wife, who
died at the White House October 22, 1S02.
When nearly four years a widower, on
April 6. 1S0G, he was married in New
York City to Mrs. Mary Scott Lord Dlm

had often visited them at -the White
House. This lady, with a daughter born

according to their letter, but In accord

Mr. Harrison's regime came to be
generally known and spoken of as an
honest and business administration. It
was singularly free from any crying
scandal such as had characterized some
previous administrations.
Beaten for a Second. Term.
Under President Harrison treaties of re
ciprocity were made not only with the
countries of South and Central America,
but the leading countries of Europe, re
sulting in a much freer admission of our
goods and products, and a wider exten
sion of our markets.
As during his term In the Senate he was
an advocate of the upbuilding and restor
ation of our navy, so as President he used
his best endeavors to that end and pushed
forward the construction of armored ves
sels with high-power guns, which result
ed in placing in the water the "White
Squadron," the nucleus of our present
splendid navy. The new vessels included
the Chicago, Baltimore, Charleston, Phila
delphia, San Francisco, Yorktown. New
ark, Benningrton, Concord, Machias, the
fine cruiser New York and the battleships
Texas and the ill-fated Maine.
Though the matter ended at the tlipe
by the withdrawal from Washington of
the Italian Minister on an indefinite leave
of absence, the position taken by Presi
dent Harrison was maintained, and' be
came a precedent for future dealing with
such cases.
In the spring of 1S91 the demand of the
Italian Government for Indemnity and re
dress for the hanging of members of the
Mafia at New Orleanswas met by Presi
dent Harrison in a courteous but firm re
ply to ).he. effect that , the United States
could not recognize any responsibility in
the matter unless It was shown that the
public authorities at New Orleans con
nived- at the execution, and that the
United States did not undertake to insure
the lfves of alien residents any more than
of its own citizens.
An Indian outbreak In the Northwest
during the winter of 1890-91 was managed
by the Federal authorities in such a man

During his administration a number of

During the first two years of his ad

was married to his college sweetheart, i

H. Rea, the Clerk of the United States
District Court, took a great. fancy to the
ycung men and gave him desk room in his

at a salary of 52 50 per day, which was a j
pood deal more at that time than it would
be reckoned now. This was the first
"work for pay" that he ever did.
Opportunity soon came for the young
lawyer to show the stuff he was mide of.

in a prosecution for burglary and in

leading candidate from the start and was
nominated on the eighth ballot by a vote
of 544 out of 830, the nert highest belrÂ«
John Sherman, who had 113 votes. In

candidate, and was duly Inaugurated

date January 20, 1SS5. When Sherman
captured Atlanta. September 2.'1864,-Col
onel Harrison received his first furlough
to visit home and -was assigned to thÂ«
important duty of . making a systematic
canvass of his State to recruit the forces
in the field. Returning to the front he
was placed In command of a provisional
brigade at Nashville on' the occasion of
Hood's attack on that place, December
15 and 10, 18C4, and then sent in pursuit of
Hood's retreating forces. He was later
ordered to report to Sherman at Savan
nah, via New York, but was stricken at
that place with scarict fever and did not
reach Sherman for some weeks, when the
latter was -at Goldsboro, N. C.\ and the
war nearly over. R; then resumed com
mand of his old brigade and marched
with it to Washington. D. C.,.to take part
in the grand army review, at which he
was duly mustered out, June 9, 1S65.
He joined General Buell at Bowling
Green, Ky., when he was engaged in re
pel!!r.g Bragg's invasion of that State,
and was brigaded with the Seventy-ninth
Ohio and One Hundred and Second. One
Hundred and Fifth and One Hundred and
Twenty-ninth Illinois regiments under
General Ward of Kentucky. His regiment
had the right of the brigade and was oc
cupied at first in guarding communica
tions and fighting guerrillas. He spent
much energy In drilling his men, being
extremely systematic and painstaking.
Tils theory was that every day In camp
should be a preparation for that other
day always to be kept irt a soldier's mind
âthe day of battle. Upon Rosecrans' ad
vance on Chattanooga General Ward was
sent to Nashville January. 1S63, and his
command sent to the front under Colcnel
Harrison, acting brigadier general. Later
this brigade became the First Brigade of
the Third Division of the Twentieth
Army Corps, under "Fighting- Joe"
Hooker. His first engagement of any im
portance was at Resaca, Ga., In Sher
man's campaign against General Joe
Johnston, and here Colonel Harrison was
the' first to cross the parapet of the re
doubt from which the Confederates were
driven. Later he took part In the ac
tions at Cassvine, New Hope Church,
Golgotha Church and the battles of
Kenesaw Mountain and Peachtree Creek.
There was plenty of lighting blood In
his veins, however, and when the Union
arms met with so many reverses in the
first half of 1SG2 he threw down his pen,
and, grasping- his sword, stood forth to
do or die for his country. He appointed
a deputy reporter to attend to the duties
of his rtfflee, and securing a colonel's com
mission from Governor Morton went into
camp with Company A of the Seventieth
Indiana Regiment, and in thirty days,
having recruited it up to 1000 men, led It

I make this first use of surplus wealth upon
retiring from business as an acknowledgment
of the deep debt which 1 owe to the work
men who have contributed so greatly to my
success. I hope the cordial relations which
exist between employers and employed through
out all the Carnegie Company works may
never be disturbed"; both employers -and em
ployes remembering what I said in my last
speech to the men at Homestead: "Labor,
capital and business ability are the three legs
of a three-legged stool. There Is no prece
dence, all being equally necessary. He who
would sow discord among the three is an enemy
of all." . I know that I have done my duty in
retiring from business when an opportunity
presented Itself, and yet as I write my heart
Is full. T. have enjoyed so much my connec
tion with workmen, foremen, clerks, superin
tendents, partners and all other -classes, that
it is a great wrench inde*d to, say farewell.
Happily, there is no real farewell in one sense,

the wisdom of this course, although the change
is great, even serious, and seldom brings the
happiness expected. But this Is because so
many, having abundance to retire upon, have
so little to retire to. The fathers In. olden
days taught that a man Hhould have time be
fore the end of his career for the "making of
his soul." I have always felt that old age
should be spent not as the Scotch say in

my friends of Plttsburg will approve of my

personal alms.

The pain of change and separation from
business associations and employes Is Indeed
keen; associates who are at once the best of
partners and the best of friends; employes who
ore not only the best of workmen, but the
n'Ost self-resr-ecting body of men which the
world ftas to show. Of this I am well assured
tr.d very proud.
Uut the separation, even from a business
point of view. Is riot absolute, since my capi

considered only the foundation upon which
the things of the spirit are built, and, taking

GOVERNOR IS INDIGNANT.
At 1 o'clock to-day Justice II. G. Rob

the remains of Henderson and gave the
following verdict: .
"I find that the deceased came to his
just death at the hands of the incensed
and outraged feelings of the best people
in the United States, the citizens of
Xavarro and adjoining counties. The evi
dence, as Â¦well as the confession of guilt
by deceased shows that his punishment
was fully merited and commendable."
nX 11:30 o'clock Lee French, whose wife
was beaten to death by the negro Ander
son Norris last November, climbed a tree
and made an impassioned speech to the
crowd, asking them to help him get the
murderer, who had been taken from the
jail here last week to a place of .safety,
and deal with him rs they had just dealt
with Henderson. The crowd .yelled back
that. they Â¦would assist.
The. north-bound Central train arriving
here at 12 o'clock was crowded with peo
ple from the southern part of the county,
who expressed disappointment at being
too lute. There was no militia on the
train.
At no time during the burning did Hen

THE favorites fell down many
flights of stairs at Tanforan yes
terday afternoon, and the bookies
gathered up the pieces with more
than an unctuous satisfaction.'
Threet days of happy and good behavior
sent Chills of remorse over the favorite
hoofers that went to the post and paid
their most humble respects to the book
maker.
Surprise" number one was launched In
the first race, when McAlbert, at 10 to 1,
cast the first shadow underneath the wire.
Valencienne and Letiger were on the
boards at the same odas, 2 to 1, and re
ceived the play. Dunboy and Pat Mur
phy started out to make the pace, and
they kept in advance of the field to the
stretch, when Burns moved Letiger up
and Woods sent McAlbert right along
from the fifth position. Dunboy then fell
back. McAlbert winning, Letiger petting
the plac? and Dunboy tne shpw.
Lady Bird, a 3 to 5 favorite, ridden by
O'Connor, was not the performer the tal
ent imagined. After a bad start, in which
Burns on Lapidus got all the best of it,
the Held of seven ocgan a hot, cutting 1
pace over the three and a half furlong
course. "Lapidus was never headed, nor
did Contestant ever lose sight of the
place. Lady Bird got the show.
Catastrophe was the first real favorite
of the day to get the first money. The
race was between Catastrophe and
Diomed. though Onyx led all the way to
the stretch. They went over the mile
route in none too fast timfc.
Hands went up into the air and a joyous
shout came from the grand stand when
Dr. Cave beat out Tuthill In the seven
furlong race. Dr. Cave could be had at
any price from 15 to 1 to 30 to 1 and was
foolishly slighted by the bettors.
Soon after the start Thorpe took Dr. Cave
to the front, and all that Henry on Tut
hill or Burns on RedwaW could do availed
little as far as reaching Dr. Cave was
concerned. Toah was the 6 to 5 ftvorlte
with O'Connor up, but did not conjÂ«j with
in the money.
Bard of Avon, pteered by Tommy Burns,
furnished another surprise. Wo de Altar
and Bonnie Lissak were considered the
likely winners, but there was no -other
horse in the race over the full five and a
half furlongs but the Bard. Bonnie Lis
sak, steered by O'Connor, worked her
way up through the field for the place.
Rio got the show.
So heavy was the play on Owensboro in
the last race that the odds were backed
down from 4 to 6 to R to 20. Owensboro
was the only horse in the race, though
Macy made a strong finish and got the
place. â¢ ' .'i .

AT TANFORAN TRACK
MOBTOX. the game little red
horse, lost another purse at Oak
land track yesterday In a nailing
hard drive with Lovinpr Cup, and
what a howl of dissent went up
from some of his backers because the
mare's number was flashed first. The pair
met in the fifth race of the day at seven
furlongs, and Horton, with Johnny Bull
man in the saddle, received stanch back
ing at even money. Bullman had already
put Scotch Plaid over the plate winner,
and as this latter mount was to mark his
iinal appearance prior to departing for the
East, a great many left-handed and mati
nee speculators bet the limit. From the
start Bullman took no chances with Hor
ton, never letting Sea Lion or Loving
Cup get more than two lengths in front
of him. Losing three lengths by an un
usually wlÂ»ie turn Into the stretch with
Horton, Bullman. by hard riding, later jon,
headed Loving Cup. taking the front po
sition. After passing the paddock, then
half a length to the good, Johnny made a
fatal err-jr. Putting his whip uway, he
eaped Horton up a bit, and as he did.
Loving Cup responded to Matthews' call
and. compelling Bullman to again resort
to the whip, nipped the favorite a head on
the post. Of course, to many on the other
side of the wire. It did not seem possible
that Loving Cup could get up, but people
will make many mistakes trying to pick
close finishes fT.m an. angle. To any of
the spectators in the grand stand on a
direct line with the wire it was plainly
apparent Loving Cup had won. It is diffi
cult to please all, however, and the Judges
came in for an unjust and uncalled for
display of hissing and jeering from fifty
or sixty disgruntled bettors.
The track was still . very heavy next
the rail, necessitating the use of the
'"overland route." Even with this draw
back, favorites managed to arrive on
echedule time in three instances. The
crowd was the largest of the week.
As distance event* are always popular
the two-mile run. a sort of preparatory
drill for the Thornton stake starters,
proved a most fetching attraction. For
some- inexplicable reason the public in
sisted on making Bar.gor favorite, taking
the chance that he would forget to sulk.
"Well, he didn't, and after a mile had been
traversed See on Locochee cut across loto
at the turn and assuming the lead fairly
cakewalked home, twenty lengths before
Dr. Marks. After going one mile and a
quarter El Mido, the second choice, was
attacked with a hemorrhage and Dom
inick pulled the hotss up. The winner, a
4 to 1 chance in the betting, is owned by
"Boots" Durnell, the Anglo-American
trainer, -who hissed the Horton decision,
because it was so deucedly unlike the
English custom, "doncher know."
A four furlong da^h for two-year-olds
opened the racing. Kddie Cassin looked
to be winning with the S to 1 shot Irma
A, when he eased uo and was downed
a neck by the favorite, Monastic. Botany
ran a fair third.
Five started in tlie.mile and a furlong
selling event, -with LJ^nator ruling a 1 to ?
favorite. Dominick on Don Luis tried
very hard to land- his mount, but tne
choice had too much in reserve, winning
cleverly by two lengths. Ringmaster ha3
lost all form, for Alicia led him out eight
open lengths for third place.
Bullman piloted Scotch Plaid and at 1
to 3 took tMe mile and a sixteenth purse
as he pleased. Little L. Jackson made
quite a hit bv getting the place on Gold
Badge, a 50 to 1 shoi. Old Vassai, pulling
up very lame, ran third.
Fred Foster's mare Peace, an even
money favorite, captured the last event
over the. Futurity course. Xullah trailed
in second place the entire route, losing at
the wire by a neck only.
Track Notes.
Oakland track offers the racegolng pub
lic one of the finest cards of the season
this afternoon. Besides five other well
filled events the rich Gunst handicap,
with a great field 01 horses starting, will
be the feature. Ad.-ance Guard and Tela
mon are now at Oakland track and are
certain to face the barrier.
U. V. Bell, the wealthy JCew Tork turf
man, had a swell wjger down on Horton
and took occasion to tell the judges {iiat
from his position their decision was per
fectly right.
In bidding good-by to friends Bullman
said that he bore none out the friendliest
feelings toward the Oakland officials. He
stated that he had received an offer to
stay over and ride Articulate in the
Derby, but for certaiu Reasons would un
der no conditions accept a mount away
from Oakland track.
Bullman is persevering and his honesty
above reproach and his California ad
mirers wish him every success the coming
season in the East.

Hounds Selected to Compete
This Week Are Well
Matched.
FAST DOGS DRAWN
FOR THE STAKE
pj-np^HERE is an impression among the
I roomers in an Ellis-street lodging-
I house that one O'Brien, director of
i\ physical culture for the Young
Men's Christian Association, must
be a. holy terror. Not only that, but also
that he is turning docile and Irreproach
able young men of San Francisco Into
truculent young counterparts of Hercules,
who will, if nothing is done t& stay them
in- their progressive career, eventually
punch an end out of the lodging-house
that abuts upon their gymnasium. In the
meantime O'Brien smiles complacently,
entirely unconscious of the sensation
which he and his muscular pupils are cre
ating nightly.
Every evening, from 7 to 8 o clock, there
Is a volleying of hard-shut windows in the
lodging-house, simultaneously with the
beginning of a rattling in the gymnasium, r
which gains in speed and intensity up to j
about 10 p. m. At first the supposition |
was abroad that the progressive O'Brien j
bad some new sort of handball game from j
the East, whence he came,' that the balls !
were coming out of a repeating gun of the
Gatling fashion and bounding against the I
gymnasium wall, and that he was acting [
as "gunner and preceptor at one and the |
same time. This idea was laughed down j
by the men boarders. What then was the j
mysterious din? An emissary was secret- 1
ly sent to talk it over with O'Brien. This !
walking delegate arrived about 7:23 p. m. !
and was ushered into a room where the
instructor, in tights, was teaching a Bible
class of young -men, similarly arrayed.
The visitor gazed at their prodigious bl- 1
ceps development and their ponderous I
calves and suddenly became aware that j
he was in the presence of the "church i
militant." I

Being a timid man, the emissary falt
ered out some excuse that would make a
recording angel -weep by reason of its in
sincerity and turned back to the lodging
house, petrifiea with astonishment at
what he had setn.
The whole nightly whirlwind of sound
which disturbs the lodgers cornea from the
young Men's Christian Association
punching bags, â¢which are close to the
party wall between the Y. M. C. A. gym
nasium and the lodging-house. These an
kept bounding back and forth with a din
that might fill a Chinese orchestra with
envy. Very likely the lodgers are right
in one respect. If one of the muscular
Christian athletes should miss the baÂ«r
once, nothing rould stop him from punch
ing In the lodging-house wall. Hence the
athletes will be cautioned to hold their
muscle3 a bit, for demolishing lodging
houses is not vet included in the Y. M. C.
A. course of physical culture.

. GUESTS SHIVER IN TERROR.
Messrs. Dunne, Hampton, Nealon and
Lenihan in an Exhibition Match
at Olympic Club.
Half a hundred members of the Olympic
Club, who are devotees of the game of
handball, and a number of ladies, guests
of the club, were last night given a cor
rect idea how the game should be played.
Ex-Alderman James Dunne of Brooklyn,
J. C. Nealon, Al Hampton and "Dick"
Lenihan, masters of the game, played a
four-handed contest, and during the en
gagement the enthusiasts went wild over
the brilliant playing. The "rubber" was
played in honor of Miss Dunne, the Misses
Nealon and Miss Hampton, none of whom
have ever seen their father and brother
play the game.-
Messrs. Dunne and Nealon have passed
the fifty year mark, but to see them skip
ping about the court, a spectator, might
be convinced that they were but one score
and ten. Hampton and Dunne paired off
and Nealon und "Dick" Lenihan, the
"over-hand s'.vipÂ£r." were -their oppo
nents. The latter team secured the first
game by a score of 21-19. The next three
games went to Hampton and Dunne by
the following scores: 21-19, 21-13, 21-13.
The work ' of the men was brilliant.
Dunne's play was eagerly watched, and
his playing created enthusiasm. His easy
manner of returning the ball, meeting it
in the air and Killing. it with the left was
the best seen at the Olympic court since
its erection. The games were hard-fought
and were only won by the hardest kind of
playing. Mr. Nealon played a more con
sistent game than his partner, Lenihan.
The latter was bent on "killing" the ball
and. although he was successful in a ma
jority of attempts, he failed at. critical
moments. Hampton played his usual great
game.

It is known that Burns is with Williams
to the end. and that all his influence and
money will be behind the Emeryville
track.
When the transfer of the smaller inter
ests was .made, those selling assured Mr.
Williams of their loyalty and support,
and said they would stand by him .to the
finish and lend him every assistance.
"I wish to retain your friendship and
advice and ask the present board of direc
tors to remain in .office, each to hold Ju;.'t
enough stock to legally qualify hint
"I have heard" rumors of a proposed
compromise. No one has bee'n authorized
by me to offer a compromise. The only
offer I have made is one of purchase. I
have offered $600,000 for the Tanforan and
Ingleside tracks and the offer still stands.
The only compromise I'll make is to buy
these tracks at a liberal price. I have
looked for no compromise and have asked
for none. Furthermore, I will not enter
tain any proposition for one.
"I know I am right, and I know I will
eventually win."
"While I appreciate the loyalty of all
of you in the track war that Is on I wish
to in no way embarrass any of you and
for that reason have, with Mr. Burns,
secured all the stock. 1 have my own
ideas of how this battle should be con
ducted and want to carry. them out.
"I have no doubt of the outcome. I feel
certain of success.
Furthermore it is announced by Messrs.
AVIlliams and Burns that there will be
no compromise with the San Francisco
Jockey Club, which â¢ owns the Tanforan
and Ingleside tracks.
While AVilllams and Burns have always
held a controlling interest in the Califor
nia Club there havÂ« been a. number of
6mall_ shareholders. These*- were called
together at the rooms of the club on
Kearny street last night and Mr. Wil
liams said to them:
Thomas H. Williams Jr. and Colonel D.
M. Burns are now sole owners of all the
interests of the California Jockey Club
and sole proprietors of the Emeryville
racetrack. They have bought the Inter
ests of Mose Gunst and all others who
owned stock in the club.

Pure soap does that. This

we mean without alkali.

Mailboat Newport Arrives.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamship
The steam schooner Cocuille River has
been In hard luck of late. She made e.
good run from here to Coquille River, but
when loaded and readv to return it wa3
blowing so hard that she could not pass
out over the bar. For a week she lav at
anchor awaiting an ODDortunity to make
a start. When the chance did come. Cap
tain Thompson lost no time, but under a
full head of steam rros^ci out. No sooner
was the Coquille River safely across thj
bar than the pale came up again stronger
than ever. It linallv blew so hard an-J
such a heavy sea was raging that the
steamship had to be hov> to. The waves
breaking over her caused 'he deck lash
ings to carry away, and In a few minutes
the deck load of lumber was gone. With
th^. deck load went part of the bulwarks,
while the standing rigging was considc
ably damaged and part of the deck houso
carried away. The rudder head broke
and It took thirty-six hours to rig a Jury
steering gear.

THE United States army transport
Buford, that arrived from Ma
nila late Tuesday night, had a
hard time of it during the run
across. She was caught in a
monsoon between the Philippines and
Japan and some of the soldiers thought
they were never g-oing- to see land again.
From Nagasaki to San Francisco nothing
but head winds and heavy cross seas were
encountered. Added to these unfavorable
circumstances the Buford has not been in
the drydock since she left Xew York,
nearly a year ago, and her bottom is very
foul. She will go to Hunters Point for an
overhauling In a few days.
The Buford is a sister ship to the Kirk
patrick, now on her way here from Ma
nila with 400 sick soldiers, and both of
them are very much like the Warren. The
Buford was built in 1S30 by Harland &
Wolff at Belfast. Ireland. She is 3732 tons
gross and 23SS tons net burden, 370 feet
b inches long. 44 feet 2 inches beam and
26 feet 6 inches deep. She will be ready to
pail for the Philippines again on April 1
next.

atempted to "brazen it out." and when
the officers showed that they were not to

overtaken after a chase of several blocks.
"Jim" Thorpe, alias Wilson, an Eastern
crook, was arrested last nlg,ht by Detec
tivps McMahon and Bailey and sevesal
charges of petty larceny were placed
against him. Thorpe had since his arrival
hero Irom the East a short time ago been
working a neat swindle on several mer
chants, securing from them hundreds of
cigars. He would telephone an order to
the merchant asking that he deliver
three or four boxes of cigars at a certain
place, invariably naming as the place
where they were to be delivered the busi
ness address of a customer of the mer
chant. He would be there and take them
when delivered. The aid of the detectives
was invoked and they captured Thorpe
while he was awaiting the delivery of
three boxes of cigars sent on his order to
a cigar store on the corner of McAllister
and Folk streets.

WORKS A NEAT RUSE
IN STEALING CIGAB3
President Charles M. Hays of thi
Southern Pacific Company, whose return
from, the East has been feverishly awaited
by railrcad officials for weeks, arrived la
a, special train from Los Angeles las*,
evening. He immediately went to his
rooms at the Palace Hotel, dined, anl
then received the representatives of the
press. ,* Â¦
President Hays is not a man who im
parts any more information than he con
siders good for the general public to know
and last night he absolutely refused n
discuss the future personality of thÂ»
Southern Pacific Company, lie also wouM
not talk on the reported engagement oz.
E H. Fitzhugh of the Central Vermont.
He diplomatically intimated, however,
that an official circular containing soni.?
desired Information would be publisne I
soon, and this document will be awaited
with great interest.
Mr. Hays says that the Morgan Steam
ship Line that at present handles tho
freight of the Sunset route between New
Orleans and New York will shortly be re
inforced by four new steamers of 5000 tons
each. These ships are now being con
structed in the East. Two new steameis
of 12.000 tohs are also being constructed
at the same Eastern yards for the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company and will
be dispatched to the coast the moment
they are completed.
Mr. Hays says that he visited Galveston

tion between the Southern Pacific ami
Union Pacific roads.
and was surprised to see with what activ
ity tne large wharves are being construct
ed. The great storm delayed thla work,
but In a short time the work will be com
pleted. Galveston will then be used as
the shipping place for freight to New
York, instead of New Orleans.
The wharves are also nearly finished at
Gauymas. Mex.. Mr. Haya says, and in
a short time all freight between Central
American ports and Now York will so
East via Benson. President Hays is con
sidering the advisibility of building a
branch of the Sonora road down the Gulf
of California as far as Mazatlan.
Through this part of the country them
have been rich coal mines found. The
Mexican Government is also anxious to
see this contemplated road built.

The arguments to-day were almost en
tirely technical. Involving nice legal
points, though including exhaustive In
formation regarding the character of tho
lands of Kern County, processes of oil
production and the exact condition and
status of the claims of the various par
ties. Ward's argument was that the
lands in dispute could be taken up under
the forest reserve lieu land act, notwith
standing such Iand9 may have been found
to be mineral. This was strongly com
bated by Judge Chapman. The merits
of the entire question are Involved in the
case, and the decision of the department
is looked forward to with great interest.
WASHINGTON, March 13.-The hearing
in the matter of the so-called "scrippers"
against the petroleum miners, involving
the possession of oil lands in California,
began to-day before Judge- Van De Van
ter. Assistant Attorney General for the
Interior Department. Arguments will
probably be concluded to-morrow, when
Judge Van Dc Vanter will take the mat
ter under consideration and render his
decision several weeks hence. The attor
neys for the "scrippers" were S. C. Ward
of Los Angeles, Jeff Chandler of San
Francisco, ex-Senator Thurston of Ne
braska. Senator Mitchell of Oregon, Dud
ley & Mlchener and several other attor
neys of Washington. Counsel for the
petroleum miners were Judge Chapman
of Los Angeles, C. Llnkenbach of Bakers
field, Frank H. Short of Fresno and ex-
Senator Hunton of Virginia.

CIL LAND LITIGATION
BEGINS IN WASHINGTON
The Nevada State Journal says a Cali
fornia company has made extensive loca
tions for oil near Reno and is promising,
big things. y
There is considerable activity among the
oil- men In Santa Barbara County. The
Elizalde Oil Company Is operating in
Sherman canyon, eight miles from Santa
Maria. Close lo the Elizalde is the Cas
malia. oil well, owned and controlled in
San Francisco. This company is putting
in another rig on the Arrelanes ranch and
operations will begin at once. Tlllmann &
Bendel are building a rig on the Holland
ranch, which will also be in operation in
a few days. The Western Union, which
is also owned by Los Angeles capitalists,
and which has now a well, has just se
cured a new boiler and will start drilling
another well at once. In this district
there are now about twelve companies at
work, not one of which Is selling stock.
One day recently forty-two claims were
filed on the desert in San Diego County,
the whole aggregating 6720 acres. All the
claims except four were filed by nine per
sons.
Ten wells will be drilled from the end
of a new wharf, 700 feet long, to be con
structed at Summerland.
The operators in Kern County who have
been trying to lease Eastern cars for the
moving of their oil have stopped negoti
ating upon learning the Southern Pacific
Company will refuse to move private cars.
The Sunset District now has a stage
line. A full-fledged postofflce is expected
to be the next addition.
A surveying corps is on the srround run
ning a preliminary line from the McKit
trick branch to the terminus of the road
soon to be built to the Sunset District,
says the Bakersfield Californian. The
right-of-way has also been secured for a
branch railway up the "32" canyon and
into the interior of section 29-1S. 2S. An
attempt will be made to have the South
ern Pacific Company construct the spur.
Owing to tho increased output of the
Fullerton field. It has been found neces
sary to employ two trains daily to move
It. The Standard Oil Company is buying
largely in the 'listrict. A new pipe line is
being put in place.
An oil expert has reported favorably
upon the prospects for finding oil in the
vicinity of Gllroy.
The developments north of the bay are
awaited with great interest by the in
vestors who believe in the northern por
tion of the State as a great possible oil
field or succession of oil fields. Arrange
ments are more or less perfected for work
on the west side of Glenn Valley, near
Colusa: on the Jo Shearln place, near
Sites; on the Bob Houseman place, about
ten miles east from Vina; on the Lyons
ranch, seven miles west from Capay, and
on a tract about twenty miles west from"
Williams.
The Guerneville X-Ray says the hold
ings of former owners of lands in the
Red Slide and Cedar districts have beer,
increased largely during the past week.
Four oil companies liave been formed to
explore for oil in thtse districts.
Fresno's oil exchange has B. Hutchin
son as president; W. O. Miles, vice presi
dent, and F. W. Breed, secretary.
Utah is about to spb what can be done
In the oil line. The Â»first" company in the
State has been incorporated to work along
the Green River. Ylie claim embraces
eighty-three acres and Is situated about
lour and a half miles south from Green
River City. Already the boomers are tell
ing the public how many miles the belt
extends in all directions and that before
a well has been sunk. The experts, too,
are telling what a llr.e quality of oil there
is on the place. This may be all true,
but there is too muc:t known oil territory
on the coast to get people wildly excited
with a proposition where everything re
mains to be discovered.
The News Messenger of Lincoln, Placer
County,, says that money sufficient to
build a. Standard rig lias been at last sub
scribed. Whether a start will be mado
shortly will depend upon developments.
The Chico Enterprise reports that pipe
has been received tor ihe well going down
on the Richardson Springs property.
What is known as the Hesperian dis
trict, in Butie County, is to be mapped.
It is said to include the lands between
Mud and Deer creeks.
"Faking still flourishes," says the
Eakersfield Californian, "with Kern Coun
ty oil as a basis. The latest story conies
from Â¦ Seattle, where a female rustler Is
selling stock in a company which has not
yet struck the sand and may never do
so at $3 per share, with representations
of immense gushers> discharging high
grade oil."
Testerday being- the time set for the
hearing in Washington of the much dis
cussed issues between the scrippers and
the mineral claimants to oil lands curios
ity is on the alert concerning the decision
to come. No issue of greater importance,
so far as the matter of dollars and cents
is concerned, has been up for public hear
ing in a long: time.

Cursd of Kidney Catarrh.
Any one so afflicted should not fail to
write Dr. Hartman. All letteis an-
cwered free.
Catarrh of the bladder is not only a
distressing disease, but very difficult to
cure. If the function of the bladder
could be suspended for a few days it
would be much- easier to treat it. but to
undertake to treat an inflamed organ
and yet cive it no rest from its regular
function is quite difficult.
Peruna has proven itself, after many
years' experience, a remarkable remedy
for these cases.
Tho two cases given are only two of
hundreds we could cite. After doctors
hava failed, Peruna cures. After months
cf suffering and illness Peruna restores.

CALIFOKNIANS IN NEW YOBZ.
IN this called as in the regular session of the Senate
Morgan of Alabama has abrogated the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty, declared war on Great Britain,
whipped her without the loss of a man, destroyed the
British empire, plowed it up, sowed it with salt and
danced on the desert he has created.
One is at a loss to decide whether this old man is
more bad than foolish. He has been an extreme sup
porter of all the expansive measures of McKinley't.
administration, and then has joined rapidly the politi
cians who denounce those policies. He is a self
elected champion of :he Nicaragua canal and has ad
vocated nearly every device of its enemies to defeat
it. His course is to be accounted for only by the
j theory of periodical exaltation due to artificial aids of
enthusiasm, and the corresponding reaction in which
he abstains from the hair of the dog. He pursued the
same course with the Cleveland administration, and
is about as useful in public life as a Populist who gets
1 office by advocating the abolition of salaries and im
mediately appeals to the Legislature to have his own
increased.
When the Hay-Pauncefote treaty was made it was
intended to supersede the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. It
was an honorable agreement, assented to by Great
P#ritain and this country. .Anticipating its ratification
by the Senate, our Minister to Costa Rica and Nica
ragua, Captain Merry, was instructed to negotiate
with those States protocols for canal treaties, based
not upon the Clayton-Bulwer but upon the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty. This was to economize time, and
in the event of the ratification of the latter treaty to
enable the last Congress to pass a canal bill and permit
the work to begin this year. The three treaties were
consistent parts of a system of international agree
ments which must be made if this Government is to
build a canal on the territory of two independent
sovereignties. But the Senate refused to ratify the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty as made, and amended it into
a sort of chronic declaration of war against the civil
ized world. By its terms, if ratification were not ex
changed on the fourth day of this month it fell and
expired, and the Clayion-Bulwer treaty stands unsub
stituted and, by our own admission, in force.
Of this Senator Morgan is perfectly aware. He
is not such a fool as to be ignorant of what is known
to every citizen vrho has traced the current history
of the canal measures. Yet he tells the Senate and
the country that the President in making the Central
American protocols "nobly defied Great Britain" and
ignored the existence of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
W r hereupon Morgan hypocritically commends the
President's defiance and bellows for war.
Patience with such a creature is difficult. No {in
telligent man can read the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and
the explanation of it made by John M. Clayton in the
Senate of 1853 without seeing that it was made at the
instance of this Government, that in entering into it
Great Britain yielded to our wish and that it was for
the purpose of promoting the speedy building of the
canal which Mr. Clayton had advocated in the Senate
in 1835. We have from its ratification to this time
ceaselessly recognized the existence of that treaty and
itsjiinding force. In the face of its history to abro
gate it against the attitude of Great Britain would be
an act of national dishonor, or, in its best aspect, an
net in h* pxrnsftH onlv in thp nrKpm-f Â«-Â»f -,~ â
MORGAN AGAIN
We are an industrial and a commercial people. The
men who gi-Â»e employment to labor, who convert raw
material into sources of wealth, who find profitable
markets for all sorts of products, who construct rail
ways, build up cities and advance the prosperity of the
people r.nd the greatness of the republic, are the men
â¢whom we delight to honor. Among such worker*
and builders are the trade kings who are coming to
us from Chicago, and their guests from other cities.
For ail of them California has a cordial welcome, and
San Francisco should show it in every form of enter
tainment hospitality cm devise.
\ recent decision by City Attorney Lane indicates
that he would prefer to sec the Board of Public Works
receive the money which should pay the back debts
of the city. Mr. Lane ought also to suggest some
means by which San Francisco may accept insolvency
without its sting of discredit.
The recent escapade of a prominent sculptor, who
made noisy the hours of the night, indicates that the
artistic temperament U sometimes liable to exhibitions
which, though brilliant in their conception, are some
times loo spectacular in their execution.
Recent dispatches are authority for the announce
ment that our commercial policy is puzzling the Ger
mans. This should Lc a reasonably safe indication
that we are not making any serious mistakes.
Over ;ir.d above any direct business interests that
may be advanced by their visit there is the gratifica
tion of making the acquaintance and establishing
friendships with men of their type and character. Cali
fornia is so remote from the East that comparatively
few opportunities exist for cultivating personal rela
tions with the leaders of Eastern industry and trade.
Every such opportunity ought to be made use of tc
the fullest extent. Consequently the members of thU
party should be received with a cordial welcome that
wili be memorable to them so long as they live. We
wish their friendship even if we never have any direct
busincss^dealings with them, and that fact should b:
made manifest in every feature of their reception.
It is gratifying to have such men visit California
even though it be but for a holiday tour. No matter
bow fleeting may be their course through the State,
they cannot fail to rote the richness of its resources
and something of th? vast possibilities for business
that exist here. Consequently we have much to gain
from the visit of these keen, enterprising, sagacious
business inen, and everything should be done to inter
est them in the State.
The party is now in the southern part of the State,
having left Los Angeles for San Diego on Wednes
day. It is therefore probable they will reach San
Francisco within a few da\-Â». Their reception will, of
course, be in the hands of commercial men, and no
doubt ample arrangements have been already made
for giving them a genuine San Francisco welcome.
The matter, however, should not be left wholly to
merchants. The visit of so distinguished a company
concerns the whole community, and as far as possible
their welcome should be made in the name of the
whole city.

Such are the experiments that are now going on
toward providing for the safety of ships along our
coasts. Of course nothing that science and invention
can do will ever suffice to make up for a lack of vigil
ance and care on the part of captains and pilots, but
if the experiments now being made prove successful,
the danger of wreck will be materially lessened. It
is of course easy to be too sanguine in matters of this
kind, but nevertheless wireless telegraphy has been
advanced so' rapidly since its first introduction by The
Call in practical news-gathering that there are good
grounds for expecting some practical system of
signaling the location of dangerous rocks will soon be
In describing the methods of signaling employed
in the experiments, the report goes on to say: "A
metallic conductor is fixed on an elevation on shore,
or on a lightship or leef. From this, etheric waves
are transmitted over a zone which has a radius of
seven miles. All vessels fitted with receivers, when
within that area are warned of their proximity to dan
ger, the distance and the point of the compass- being
registered. * * * The automatic part of the in
vention consists of steel bearings with a number of
teeth which pass over a Morse transmitter. No
operators are needed. The machine works absolutely
automatically." It is zdded: "In its elementary prin
ciples the system resembles Marconi's method of wire
less telegraphy, but in detail the system is essentially
different."
While our Government is thus directing its energies
toward increasing the value of the service that notes
the approach of storms, the Canadians are working
directly toward the end of providing danger signal*
for ships. In "Consular Reports" for this month
there is published a statement from Consul Dudley at
Vancouver, giving an account of steps now bein^
taken to assure the safety of ships on the British
Columbian coast. The account says: "It will inter
est those whose calling takes them into these waters
to learn that an invention is now being investigated
by the marine authorities and navigators at South
end-on-sea, which, if it may not go a long way toward
making lighthouses obsolete and unnecessary, is ex
pected to be of much value in the prevention of ship
wreck from any one of 00 per cent of the usual causes.
This is an automatic system of signaling which will
warn ships of their approach' to dangerous rocks and
coasts in all weathers when even a flashing light might
not be seen and the booming of a foghorn might hz
unheard." .
Dispatches from Washington announce that Secre
tary Wilson is experimenting with wireless telegraphy
along the coasts of Virginia and North Carolina for
the purpose of increasing the efficiency and reliability
of the reports of the Weather Bureau and has obtained
good results. Professor Moore, chief of the bureau.
is reported to have said in a recent interview: "The
most efficient method of long distance transmission
has been found to be from wire cylinders. The new
coast stations are being equipped with cylinders of
sixteen wires each and 140 feet in length. From these
cylinders it is expected to cover a magnetic field of
not less than- 500 miles. The stations now in opera
tion are at Hatteras and at Roanoke Island, in the
Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. Workmen are be
ginning the construction of a station at Cape Henry
which will be the third station. When this is finished
the two remote stations will be 127 miles apart. The
three points now are connected by a Government
telegraph line, but this line will be abandoned on the
completion of the Cape Henry station. This, inci
dentally, will save the expense of maintenance of a
half dozen repair stations."
WHEN commenting upon the wreck of the Rio
The Call directed attention to the fact that re
cent successes obtained in experiments with
wireless telegraphy give reason to believe that within
a time comparatively short science will devise a means
by which the officers of a ship proceeding along a
dangerous coast or through a narrow channel will be
able to know exactly how near theyare to the coast,
or to any rock that menaces their safety. The mean3
of attaining that much desired object seem to be well
nigh at hand. In fact we may soon see them estab
lished not only around our harbor but at every point
of note along our Pacific Coast.

IV.â VALtJE OP EXERCISE IN PROLONGING LIFE.
Â¦
My belief in the value of exercise and
athletics in the prolongation of life has
its foundation in certain scientific princi
ples which are connected with the early
life history of the' race..
If we begin at the real beginning we
should understand that we are animals
very much like other animals, and that
we are made up, as they are, each of us;
of myriads of cells that are practically
identical for all animals and have prob
ably not changed materially for countless
ages. The health and vitality of these
cellsâ and of the aggregations of cells that
make up the individual animalâ which
have enabled, them to multiply, to survive
the struggle for existence and to bring
about animal life as it exists to-day re
sult from qualities that have been devel
oped through untold centuries of fierce
competition for food, for shelter, for the
preservation of tamily or tribal relations
âin fact, for life itself. In thi3 way the
necessity for bodily exertion for the full
development of the powers of the indi
vidual became established as a basal con
dition in relation to the health of the hu
man race. The comparatively brief pe
riod covered by "history" "and the still
more insignificant time assigned to "civ
ilization" have not affected in the very
least the primal attributes of an anlnral
organization whose essential qualities are
the result of Immeasurable ages of strife
with other animals and with the ele
ments, of exposure without covering to
sun and wind and rainâ to conditions, in
other words, the conquest of which was
necessary for the preservation of the life
of the individual and the perpetuation of
the species.
The effect of these ages of struggle,
when, to use the phrase of the day, life
was truly "strenuous," has been that
every separate cell of the millions that
make up a given human organism is the
descendant of similar 'cells that owed
their life and their ability to reproduce
their kind to a resistant power to the at
tacks of disease and injury and exposure
developed under conditions of extreme
physical stress and exertion.
Primitive Requirements of Healtli.
It is Inconceivable that in the compara
tively few years of which we have any
knowledge any essential change should
have been wrought in the primal qualities
developed In the organism through the
infinitude of centuries during which the
race was developing to its present status.
There has not been time yet for us to loao
entirely even such gross and now unes
sential structures as the muscles. that >n
some of our ancestorsâ the carnlvora, for
example, were used fcr pricking up tho
ears, but are valueless to us; the little
crescent-shaped fold of skin at the Inner
angle of the eye, useless to us, but of
great value to the sharks and other primi
tive relatives of ours; or the appendix
vermiformis. worthless and, dangerous to
u ;, but larger and most useful in the di
gestive processes of our. vegetarian pre
decessors. It is evident to the scientist,
whether he studies disease and notes the
fact that some of the most deadly enemies
to life, as the bacillus tuberculosis, for
example, die and are powerless in direct
sunlight; or studies health and observes
the victory over such microscopic intrud
ers obtained by the living cells of the bodv
when they are young and vigorous and
active, that in the advancement of civili
zation many elementary hygienic princi
ples have been lost sight of. Disease has
been lessened, It Is true, by the discovery
of technical methods of prevention ami
cure, but the needs of the body, tha
essential and primitive requirements .n
health, as old as the race Itself, arc con
stantly forgotten or Ignored. The alr
breathed by crowds, the dust and dirt of
great cities, the covering of the body sur
face so as to exclude the direct rays or
the sun. the substitution of sedentary and
slothful habits for a life of Incessant ac
tivity, the modification in diet and drink
in other words, the changes in environ
ment with little or no change in the or
ganism itself, are responsible for much of
the disease and death with which tn-3
physician has to deal, and for many of
the failures and not a few of the crimes
that concern society at large.
Some Disadvantages of Progress.
The diminished general death rate due
to the labors and discoveries of the medi
cal profession is, of course, gratifying,
but it should be remembered that even,
tills has another side, and that it neces
sarily means the preservation of thou
sands of weaklings, who. If they perlshcJ
in childhood, or soon after middle age was
passed, would, at least, not perpetuate
their imperfections' in coming generations
The lowered price of meat in many
countries has put within the reach of the
laboring classes an amount of animal
food vastlv larger than ever before in
historic times. This has been in some
ways an obvious advantage, but there are
keen observers who associate the com
parative excess of meat eating, and the
coincident lessening of the hours ofMabor
and of physical effort required to procure
a subsistence, with the Increase in cases
of cancer that is thought to be taking
place in most civilized countries.
Education in modern times is far more
general Is begun earlier, is continued un
til later in* life, and embraces a curricu
lum which has widened with the develop
ment of human knowledge until it has
perforce been divided and subdivided so
that the fear has arisen that the days of
a really broad education are numbered,
and that we aro on the eve of developing
only specialists. There can. at any rate,
be no doubt that the stress ami strain
have increased, examinations with the at
tendant nervous tension have multiplied,
competition has become keener and re
wards greater and disappointments have
been correspondingly more bitter and de
pressing. All this occurs during the devel
opmental period, when the foundat ons of
health and strength should be laid and
when the nervous system especially is
most sensitive to external Impressions. A
child will have a general convulsion from
an attack of Indigestion that would give
an adult only i stomach ache. Mental in
digestion produces correspondingly grave
results in other portions of the brain.
With all the goofl that flows from the
comparatively wide diffusion of educa
tion and of knowledge at the present day
comes the counterbalancing evil, the in
creased percentage of insanity, associat
ed undoubtedly with the substitution of
mental for physical strain in the struggle
for existence Â«nd -having its foundation.
In too many cases, in the period devoted
to education. It must be noted here that
it is strain, not activity, that causfes men
tal disease. The proper use of the brain,
just as that of the body, tends to the
preservation of health.
The Cave Man's Legacy to Moderns.
Mr Treves has called attention jocular
ly to' the fact that with precisely the same
alimentary canal as served the cave man
after his meals of raw hyena meat we at
tack the aldermanie public dinners of the
nineteenth century. It i3 equally true
that while our lives depend upon the
health and strength of the same sort and
kind of cellsâ each In a sense an Indivi
dualâthat made up the bodies of our'an
cestors thousands of centuries before -the
cave man appeared, the race to a great
extent has changed its habits and meth
ods of living, with no reference to the
baÂ«al habits and needs of the cells which
compose it- The less we conflict with
these habits, the more we recognize and
meet these needs, the higher will bo the
average health of mankind.
This line of argument may seem to take
me far afield, and yet it is the scientific
justification, for the belief in the value of
exercise. .
Darwin has shown us that the chain of
life has begun In the simple and ended in
tho complex. Haeckel has demonstrated
that under the. influence of heredity the
human embryo still passes during Its de
velopment through the stages of fish and
fowl, as well as of various forms of
"flesh" that we speak of as "inferior."
before it takes its final shape. Even" the
effect of the rise and fall of the tides on
the nutrition of our . marine ancestors is
thouzht still to be shown in the periodi-
city of some of the functions of the hu
man species. '. .. âÂ»
Indissoluble ties link us to all the rest
of organic nature, and the f Â° ur . m0Sl
primitive requirements of healthâsun
light, oxygen, food to replace worn-out
cells, and (as soon as we reach the ani
mal kingdom) motion, or "exercise âare
the same now as they were when the
pulse of life first began to beat on .this
planet.
Keeping the Tissues Healthy.
Health in a human being to-day, as al
ways, consists in such a condition of
growth and development of all the tissues
and organs of the body as enables them
to fulfill their functions easily and com
pletely, respond promptly to occasional
unusual demands upon them and resist
effectually the attacks of disease. It de
pends upon the activity with which the
numberless atoms or cells that constitute
the body are cast off and replaced by
others, and upon the strength and vitality
of the latter, and this strength, there is
every reason to believe, is In almost direct
proportion to their newness. The young
cell, like the young person, has a reserve
force, an energy, a. vitality, a power of
resistance that Invariably begins to di
minish as soon as full development has
been attained. The physiologist or physi
cian, who, Aladdin-like, could offer "new
cells for old," would have discovered the
secret of perpetual youth.

opposing every effort at the extension or the increase
of the slave power.
When the war broke out young Harrison was
among the first to enlist for the preservation of the
Union. His military capacity was such that despite
the fact that he had no education or training in the
art of war he rapidly rose to command and was among
the most eminent of the generals of the volunteer
army. After the war he returned to the practice of
law and to an active engagement in politics. His
career in Congress, while not brilliant, was sufficiently
notable to attract to him the attention and win for
him the esteem of his countrymen in all parts of the
Union, so that he soon became recognized as a Presi
dential possibility. His nomination for that office
was not the result of a political accident. He had
abundantly merited it, and his career in the office
proved him to be in every way fitted for its highest
duties.
Despite his statesmanship and his never-questioned
fidelity to duty, Harrison was not a good party leader.
He became involved in controversies that disturbed
the Republican organization throughout the country,
led to the retirement of Blaine from the Cabinet, and
in the end brought about Harrison/ defeat when a
candidate for re-election. Those controversies, how
ever, have long since been forgotten by men of this
generation and will not occupy much attention from
historians. Since he has been out of office he has
borne himself in such a manner as to win the esteem
of all classes of Americans. Of late he became a not
able contributor to reviews and magazines, and gave
promise of taking a front rank among statesmen who
have in retirement cultivated literature. Such fortune,
however, has been denied him. In the maturity of a
superb manhood he has fallen a victim to the dread
disease of pneumonia, and the republic has to mourn
the loss of a great man whom she can ill spare.
BY the death of Benjamin Harrison the United
States suffers a genuine loss. He was not an
old man. His strength was not exhausted by
age or weakened by disease. In the ordinary course
of nature he might have lived for many years and con
tinued in full vigor to serve his country with that zeal
and patriotism for which he was noted from his ear
liest manhood to the day of his death. That service
he would undoubtedly have given, and its value would
unquestionably have been as great as any he had ever
given in the past, and consequently the loss of it is in
the nature of a public disaster.
The Harrisons are among the few families of this
country in which a capacity for the highest public
service has been transmitted from generation to gen
eration. In fact with the exception of the Adams
family of Massachusetts none other compares with it
in that iespcct. Nor coes the Adams family equal it.
for while that family furnished a signer of the Declara
tion of Independence and two Presidents of the
United States, as did the Harrison family, yet the
Adamses have never been distinguished in war, while
both President William Henry Harrison and President
Benjamin Harrison served the republic with as much
patriotism and efficiency on the battlefield as in the
Senate or the White House.
Born of an illustrious parentage, but to nothing of
wealth or social prestige, Benjamin Harrison passed
his youth amid conditions that best fit the American
for the service of his country. He was one of the
people. He knew poverty and learned the lessons of
equality and of the worth of labor that "are essential
to the formation of the character of statesmen who
are to guide the politics of a republic. Though
descended from Souhern ancestry he had no sympathy
with slave-holding, and like that great Kentuckian,
Lincoln, he espoused the cause of freedom *in his

A slight delay has become imperative :n

be absolutely accurate, but will have the lat-

SUPERVISORS WILL
EXTEND FIRE LIMITS
Recommendation of Fire Commission
That Sutter Street Be Dividing
Line Accepted.
The Joint committee oa Fire. Judiciary
and Buildings of the Board of Supervis
ors recommended yesterday that tr e flra
limits be extended to both sides of Sut
ter street out to Van Ness avenue: alsD
to Include Polk Â«treet from Sutter to
Jackson, extending 137V& feet on each side;
also to take in the streets from- Firs:
down to East, between Folsom and How
ard. This was decided unon at a confer
ence with Commissioner Manson of the
Board of Public Works, Flra Commission
ers Watt and Hecht and Fire Chief Sul
livan.
The extension was favored by the Fir<Â»
Commissioners, who deÂ«lre to make Sut
ter street a sort of a fireproof barrier In
case of a big conflagration. It Is under
stood that only tho<?e buildings to be
erected in the luture shall be of brick or
fireproof material. Tho Fire Commission
ers desired to have incorporated In the
new tire ordinance a Diovislon that all
buildings in excess of four stories to be
erected hereafter snail be of brick, but
this was opposed by Booth and Dwyer,
who held that it would interfere mater
ially with building operations.
The committee will also Â«recommend
that the Grand Opera-house be permitted
to extend its fire wall separating the audi
torium from the stage by adding: a cor
rugated iron partition to reach the roof;
als6 to substitute an asbestos curtain for
the one now in use.
Kate A. Besore was granted a divorce
from C. J. Besore yesterday on the

There Is a posslbilitr that the Govern
ment may be asked to assist the merch
ants of San Francisco in getting direct
steamship communication with Manila,
w.wch has not been granted by the
steamship lines doing business between
this port and the Orient Since a com
mittee was named at a meeting held at
the rooms of the San Francisco Board of
Trade to take up the matter of placing
San Francisco In a oosition to compete
with other American ;>orts that have the
facilities that they need frr carrying on
business with Manila, a systematic In
vestigation has been going on concerning
the amount of tonnage and the value of
the same that can be taien as a safe
basis of estimating the buz'ness that can
be offered. The committee named has
been subdivided and all the various con
siderations are being made the subject of
study. Very soon, therefore, the entire
subject of the shipping situation es re â¢
lated to the Philippines will be better
understood here by the merchants than It
has ever been before. Ihe urgency in the
matter is the consideration that if other
ports get the trade from San Francisco It
willl be harder to get it back later than
it would be to secure it if the proper ix
ciltles were provided 'or this port in
the near future.
T. J. Parsons Is the chairman of tb*
committee. He said yesterday that noth
ing definite could be done until all the
figures that are beine collected can be
brought together for vlie purpose of 3tudy.
It had been suggested by some members
of the committee that If the volume of
private business was not sufficient to fill
steamships to carry the traffic to Manila,
the Government might be appealed to for
assistance in establish'r.g a private line.
Some of the supplies for the soldiers in
the Philippines are carriel from Xev
York by private lines.
Another member of the committee sail
that perhaps some room might be found
on the transports. As the purpose of the
pacification of the Philippines was partly
commercial, the Government might not be
averse to extending some facilities to tlio
merchants of the P-ic.flc Coast, If that
could be accomplished without interfer
ing with the regular and full movement of
the supplies for the soldiers abroad. In
the study of the freight situation that is
being made, statistics are also being
gathered from other ports that might shl;>
advantageously through the port of San
Francisco. Another conference may be
held with the management of the Oriental
steamship lines.

Julius W. Raphael, president of the
Raphael Clothlrg Company, has returned
to this city after a tour of the principal
trade centers cf the East. Mr. Raphael
has made a careful study of the commer
cial outlook In that section of the coun
try and of the attitude of leading busi
ness men toward California and San
Francisco.
There Is a quietness in general trade In
the East, Mr. Raphael says, which con
trasts sharply With the life in business
here. The eyts of the commercial men
throughout the country are on California,
and great Interest is being taken In its
progress and development. Everywhere,
Mr. Raphael stites, there is ageneral pride
felt In California fruits and wines, and
dealers find the advertising of our pro
ducts a successful inducement to custom
ers. Great Interest Is felt In the Hawaiian
cable enterprise, and the effect of the
ship subsidy bill in reference to Califor
nia was much discussed. Oil and /the mat
ter of Hawaiian sugar, which directly
concerns this State, are also questions of
paramount commercial importance, and
are attracting a large amount of atten
tion among Eastern capitalists. There
never was an opportunity like the pres
ent. Mr. Raphael states, for Callfornlans
to help their State, and there is plenty of
capital In the East, which would seek in
vestment here i' our opportunities were
properly presented.
Other portions of the State, Mr. Raphael
observed, are surpassing San Francisco in
the advertisement of their industries and
drawing- attention away from this city.
Another important matter Is representa
tion at Washington. Memorials to rep
resentatives are well enough In their way,
but there shou'.d be a strong permanent
organization at the national capital to
properly present the cause of California.
The city should be built up. Mr. Raphael
says, and 'made attractive In order that
local confidence in the future of San
Francisco may be shown. "We are," Mr.
Raphael states, "too apathetic. We have
the finest kind of an opportunity now, and
what we want most or all Is to wake up."

The Supervisors' public utilities com
mittee decided at its meeting last night
to cite the officials of the Market-street
Railway Company to explain why certain
ttreets, from whic.^ the company had tak
en up abandoned tracks, have not been
put in their original good condition. Chair
man Reed stated that the resolution of
the board directing the company to re
store the streets had not been compiled
with, and referred particularly to Oak and
Ellis streets. None of the officials of the
company were present and the matter
went over until next week.
Chairman Reed and City Engineer Grun-
Eky had a wordy tilt over certain bills In
curred in Investigating water supplies.
"The Board o; Works seems to have un
limited power to employ men." said Reed,
"but it does not have the power to con
tract other bills without the authority of
the Supervisors. This board instructed
the Board of Public Works to make an
alyses of water until the winter rains set
in, but bills for work other than that
continue to ccme In."
"Plans were made for that work before
any action wa? taken by the Supervisors,"
paid Grunsky. "To get results you must
spend money."
Reed asked tf the Board of Works would
proceed on the assumption that it had an
unlimited supply of funds, and Grunsky
replied that it would be governed by the
Fum of money available. Reed then asked
Grunsky when he could make a report on
water supplies, and Grunsky said he
would ask the Board of Works, as he was
not answerable to the Supervisors. He
finally said that a report on the estimate
of the cost to bring GO.OOQ.OOO gallons of
water daily from the Tuolumne RH-er
would be ready in June, though it would
be Incomplete. He would also report on
the cost of an electric light plant by next
week.
Russell L. Dunn explained the offer of
himself and William C. Albereer to sell
the "Giant Gip" water supply on the
American River for $17,400,000. He said the
water rights and adjacent lands would be
sold for $2,000,000, and the sale of electric
power would meet the operating expenses.
The rights of the American Ditch Com
pany on the American River would not be
impaired, as his concern had a prior right
to the water. He was prepared also to de
fend the city against any litigation
brought by the Folsom Power Company.
The offer was then referred to the Board
of Works for a fuller Investigation.

playing marked activity at the tap of the
gong. By its bulge tq-day May pork shows
a rise of $1 50 since ten days ago. The open
ing advance was based on light hog receipts
and higher prices in the market at the yards
A heavy general demand existed throughout
the day. Straggling shorts who had hoped
against hope for a reaction covered at a loss
with the result that the market, having made
Its advance during the forenoon, held at its
best during the remainder of the session. The

were mado came from profit-taking lone*
Hog receipts, have been on a diminishing
scale for ten days, and prices at the yards
are above the parity of the manufactured
product. " making it more profitable to buy In

moved very narrowly. Some of this class were
moved late in the dav apparently through
manipulation, as though the professional opera
tors were prompted to correct the appearance
of singularity In th' market, due to the special
character of the trading. Nevertheless the day's
operation? footed up. quite an Important aggre
gate and the general appearance of the market,
notwithstanding its peculiar features and the
difficulty of analyzing It. was one of activity
and Btrer.cth. There was a tendency to yield
the highest pricea as Interest was shifted to
new joints. Extensive realizing was going on
in the general list under cover of the Btrengtli
In Fpots, and in the last hour an active selling
movement to take profits caused a General re
action reaching a point or more in some of the
active stocks. The closing itself was rather
easy and much below the beat all around.
Among the day's special movements the South
western stocks were prominent, led by St.
Louis Southwestern, the common rising 4 and
the preferred <\.. The Lake Erie and Western
stocks were very strong, the common rising
4?Â» and the preferred 4. It is believed that the
movement indicates new conditions for that
system. Buffalo. Rochester and Pittsburg pre
ferred and Burlington. Cedar Rapids and
Northern rose 4 points each. The express stocks
were strong. American Express rising 4. Wells
Farro 2%t and United States 3, with a reaction
of 14. Smelting stocks were weak throughout,
the common falling 3*4 and the preferred 14.
Many of these movements were without any
explanation and others were based on vague
rumor? for which no official sanction could be
had. The movement In the Southwestern group
was the most consistent of the day and was
based upon the evidence of substantial prosper
ity among the railroads In that region and the
general l>ellef that plans for extensive consoli
dation are working out.
The money market continued unruffled in
spite of the absorption by the Sub-Treasury
thus far this wefk of $2,167,000 and the knowl
edce that $20,000,000 must be provided for the
disbursement of the Standard Oil dividend on
Friday.
Business in railroad bonds continued larpe
and many substantial advances were scored.

LONDON. March 13.â The offerings at the
wool auction sales to-day numbered 13,630
bales. A much better feeling prevailed and
competition was spirited. Be6t scoured realized
full rates and greasy was firm and sold > freely
at unchanged prices. There was an Important
demand for the Continent, and buyers secured
good lines of scoured merinos. Crossbreds
were taken freely, fine grades selling at full
rates. Inferior crossbreds were irregular. A
smaller supply of Cape of Good Hope and
Natal was offered and lt sold fairly well, but
there were withdrawals, as bids were V4Â®4d
below sellers' views.
London Wool Market.
There Is a steadier tone to the wool mar
ket, and on the whole a more careful feeling
Is apparent than has been manifest for some
time. A large volume of business has been
transacted, and it has been done without
making any further concessions in prices. The
pressure to sell wool is decidedly less marked
than lt was, and some holders have refused
to let wools go on a difference of only 4c
between their views and those of the Intend
ing buyers. Reports frpm manufacturers as
to the business which they are doing indi
cate that orders on large weights have been
surprisingly large, but that fancy worsteds
have been slow. *
Sales for the week in Boston amounted to
4.913.000 pounds domestic and 1,310.000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 6,233,000 pounds,
against a total of 3,729.500 pounds for the pre
vious week and 1,907,000 last year.
The sales since January 1 amounted to 40,
659,800 pounds, against 34.408,000 pounds for
the corresponding time last year.

close. This was on a private announcement
received by a big African house that several
Transvaal mines have been allowed to resume
operations. Americans were quiet, and except
for a spurt in Missouri Pacific and Kansas Pa
cific, were featureless. This spurt was in the
street after hours. The bank bought Â£10,000
gold bars. Money was easy.

NILES. Mich.. March IXâ The directors
of the First National Bank (suspended)
to-day filed a declaration against Charles
A. Johnson, the missing cashier of the
bank, alleging that forgeries amounting
to $100,000 against leading citizens of this
conSraunit7 have been committed by him.
It was reported to-day that there' was
a large quantity of forged paper held by
tbe Institution. Bank Examiner Seidon
filed papers with the County Ckrk at SL
Joseph attaching ali cf Johnson's prop
erty, but It will not cover the shortage
by a large amount. No trace of Johnson
was discovered to-day. _
Of the fotged paper found $20,000- was
against T. LÂ». Wilkinson of St. Joseph, a
member of. the abstract tan of Dix &
Wilkinson, which did a large business
with the bank. A petition will be sent to
the ; Comptroller of the Treasury asking
him to appoint some business man re
ceiver of the bank. So many local manu
facturers and business flrras are embar
rassed by the suspension that it is vital
to the town that -the bank's affairs be
settled with the utmost speed. The re

For the past few days the Impending
war between the Suey Dins and the Hop
Sings has caused the highbinder situation
In Chinatown to a?<*t*me a serious aspect.
The members of Lieutenant Price's squad
have all been Instiucted to search sus- #
plclous characters for weapons and last
night Officer Taylor discovered a revolver
concealed under th-Â» blouse of Ah Bun,
who was out evidently looking fora vic
tim on Dupont street- As Taylor was
about to seize Bun the latter started in
run and entered the building where the
struggle took place. Taylor was close be
.-hlnd and succeeded in stopping him In
one of the corridors. â¢
When the Mongollac found himself cor
nered he drew the revolver and pointing
it at the officer raided the "hammer, but
before it could descend on the- cartridge
Taylor slipped "his hand over it and the
fight for possession oJ the weapon began.
It took Taylor some time to disarm the
heathen and after he did no he took him
to jail. /

M. A. Barlow and VT. Guerin. two well
dressed young men who recently arrived
from the East, cleverly fooled two bunko
men yesterday^ After having the table*
turned on th#m and losing their money,
amounting to X1Z0. the bunko men became
belligerent and attempted to "mix it"*
with their Intended victims, with the re
sult that Barlow and Guerin were ar
rested and charged with, grand larceny.
According- to the story of Guerin. he was
approached la the 'court of the Palacs
Hotel yesterday morning by . a weli
dressed young man. who after Introduc
ing himself as the son of a wealthy cattle
dealer of Montana asked him if he wanted
to make some "easy" raoriey. Gueria re
plied in the atSrmative. and at the invita
tion of the stranger* he walked outside.
where they were joined by another man.
who wa3 introduced by the bunko man
as the owner of a large racing stable.
The swindlers then unfolded a achesio
whereby Guciin could make a fortune by
taking their tips oa the races. At their
invitation he accompanied them to a room
on Kills street, where Guerln was Intro
duced to aootner man, who represented!
that he was a bookmaker. Suspecting
that he was In the bands of bunko men.
Guerin left the place on the pretense tha;
he had an engagement with a. friend who
had â¢â¢money to burn" and promised to re
turn with him in a short time.
Meeting Barlow he confuted his sus
picions to him and together they resolved
to "beat" the men at their own game.
Upon the return of the Eastern men to
the alleged poolrooa:. one of the bunEo
men, who proved to be "Kid" Blakeley.
a well-known confidence operator, impor
tuned Guertn to bet on a horse, which ha
claimed could not lose.
"It is a oinch," assuring!}* remarked
Blakeiey. "He'll win i:. a walk unless ho
drops dead." â¢ -
As both the Intended victims claimed to
be "broke," Blakeley offered to advanc4
Querin some money on his diamond rlaÂ£
to bet on the horse. Guerln refused to
part with his ring, but turning to Barlow
ne asked him. if. he could not borrow sonvj
money from the proprietor of tho hotel
in which hÂ© was stopping so that they
could play the hgrse. Barlow, who wu
determined to "skin" the bunko men. im
mediately left the place, after sayins that
he was going to th& hotel to get socÂ»<Â»
money.
After waiting a short time the bunk.-*
men. at GuÂ«>rin's Invitation, walked to
Powell and Market street?, where Barlow
met the*. Exhibiting a check for J150 bÂ»
claimed that the money which he expect
ed to receive from his father had not ar
rived, and asked them to cash It.
Thinking that the check was genuine.
one of tbe bunko men, after having Guer
in and Barlow Indorse It. handed him thÂ»
amount called for. After receiving tfca
money Barlow grabbed the check and tore
it in pieces.
Angered at Barlow's action the bur.Â»e
men started to make him a subject tor
the Coroner, when Guerin. who was stand
ing Idly by. took a hand in tne fight, ami
soon placed the schemers hors-de-cornba?.
Just then two policemen appeared and at
Blakeley's request they placed Barlov
and Guerln under arrest for grand lar
ceny. It Is more than likely that their
cases Trill bÂ« dismissed to-day.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 13.â Two pitched battles
were fought in the Assembly to-day over
the franchise assessment bill, for which
the railroad forces are making such stren
uous efforts. The opposition gained some
temporary advantages, but In the end the
corporation men were . triumphant, and
there Is scarcely a doubt that the bill will
be passed to-morrow. -
Fish's motion to reconsider prevailed at j
the morning session. He at once offered f
two amendments, one striking out the j
following words In the first section: "The
franchises of rl! other quasi-public cor
porations shall be assessed In the county
in which such corporations owning or
holding them have their principal place of
business." This was a concession aimed
to win the votes of enough country mem
bers to carry the bill, and apparently
they have risen to the bait.
The bill was allowed to go over tempo
rarily en request of Dunlap, and at the
evening session he offered an amendment
striking out the provision, which, as the
railroad partisans admit, is the milk in
the cocoanut, as follows: "In. the assess
ment of franchises of a corporation the
assessable value thereof shall be ascer
tained by taking from the. full cash value
of its entire issued capital stock the full
cash valu^ of all other property assessed
to it."
The motion by Dunlap to appoint a select
committee of one to amend prevailed by a
vote of 32 to 30, but the report of the se
lect committee of one. amending the bill,
was rejected by a vote of 31 ayes to 26
noes.
The amendment waÂ« thus killed and the
bill will appear on final 'passage to-morrow
with the- clause Just referred to contain
ing the -following, added by amendment,
offered by Fisk: "And also the full cash
value of property owned by it."

intercept the Japanese smugglers, who
are reported to be landing the little brown
men in large numbers among: the island.-*
of the San' Juan group andin the vicinPy
of Bellingham Bay. The Grant went di
rectly to Port Townsend, where it is sad
two or three immigration inspectors will
be taken on board and a systematic watc'i
maintained iicross the straits for soma
time to come. , -
It has been suspected for some time by
Immigration authorities that Japanese
were being brought across the boundary,
both by land and water. A patrol was
established along the boundary sonic
weeks ago. but so far has reported uo
sign of smugglers. This led to the belief
that the larger operations were being con
ducted by water and orders were issuc-1
to the Grant. . â¢ .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 13.â One of the most
awful cases of, parental cruelty that ever
came to light in this city, according to
the officials, resulted yesterday evening
in the arrest of Mrs. Jane Arlington, aged
41, and her husband, John Arlington. They
have been living at 1207 ; Grant street
bridge with an adopted daughter, Lizzie
Hall, aged 15, an orphan child, who for
merly lived in Vancouver, Wash. The
Arlingtons are jointly charged with the
crime of criminal assault under the State
statutes, and have been held in bonds of
$50(Meach. The case will be heard in the
Superior Court to-morrow morning at 9:30
o'clock. . -
Lizzie Hall wa's apparently beaten al
most to death j yesterday. It is charged
that John Arlington sat in the room and
watched his wife whip the girl until she
was almost unconscious, all the time com
mending 'her, for giving the girl, as he
said, "what she needed."
Although there were no eyewitnesses to
the actual whipping,- the poor girl's
screams and moans as the infuriated
Â¦woman lashed her savagely with a heavy
stick and beat her about the head and
body attracted the attention of the neigh
bors, and Mrs. Butler, wife of Patrick
Butler, who lives near by, ran into the
house to investigate. De3plte the cruel
ferocity displayed by the child-beater
Mrs. Butler tore the bleeding gin from
the grasp of Mrs. Arlington and naif car
ried, half led her into a grocery,
where she was safe for the time being.

tion for a continuance James Callahan,

cated in the kidnaping on December IS.

prison-house when young Cudahy was
held for ransom, and that he has not been
in Crowe's company since December 1 of
last year.
The case against Callahan is set for

alleged that Callahan has been Incar
cerated in the City and County Jails for
Beveral weeks and that he has been pre
vented from consulting with friends and
attorneys; that having been so confined
he has been unable to secure witnesses
who will swear to his whereabouts on

davit It is alleged that the police are

strength of the telcpram her sister Nora

Cooper was arrested at Ogden.'
The evidence of Mrs. Schneider showed
that Cooper had gone so far as to issue
cards of invitation three weeks before the
wedding and that she had called him to
account for so doinjj. The witness denied
however, that she had given a positive
consent to the wedding; all she had done

The case of Charles H. Smith vs. Cali
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company
and C. K. King as administrator of the
estate of J. W. Smith, deceased, is \>n
trial In the United States Circuit Court.
The action was brought about a year ago
to determine the ownership of 304 bonds
of the railroad company of the par value
of $1000 each. The bonds are in the pos
session of the Safe Deposit Company,
awaiting the order of the court. The
plaintiff claims the bonds as his personal
property, while King contends that they
belong to the estate.
Testimony., in the case had been taken
by United States Court Commissioner
Heacock, who reported to .United States
Circuit Judgo Morrow his findings that
the bonds belonged to the estate. But a
new complexion has since been given to
the case by the production on the part of
the plaintiff, who is a son of the deceased
J. W. Smith, of the following assignment:
OAKLAND, Cal., August 14. 1S33.
For value received t hereby sell, deliver and
assign to C. II. Smith all the bonds which I
own of the California and Nevada Railroad
Company, belnc 301 In number, all of J1000
each, including the order and the requisition
on the Central Investment Company for seven
ty-five of the said bonds, subject to the option
given to F. M. Smith, which I also assign to
C. H. Smith. J. W. SMITH.
The Introduction of this assignment
practically reopens the case In the Cir
cuit Court, and the whole of yesterday's
session was spent in examining experts
as to the signature of J. W. Smith, the
contention being made by the opposition
that the signature on the assignment was
not genuine. The taking of testimony will
bo resumed thi3, morning.

Primary School. At the last meeting
there was a deadlock, easterly and Mark
votinrj for Miss Nora Sullivan and Kln
caid and Denman for Miss Jessie ;3mith.
Five more ballots were tcken yesterday,
but the deadlock was not broken.
Attorney Mlze addressed the board with
a petition that I^iitln bo taught In the
Polytechnic High School. The Directors
were not favorable to the proposition, but
Superintendent Webster stated that thore
were sixty pupils who desired to take the
course. President Kincaid then said she
would investigate as to whether Latin
could be introduced without Interfering
with other studies.
The Board of Education yesterday de
clined to accept the decision of the Su
perior Court ordering the reinstatement
of Mrs. ivlary Mead Morrissey to her posi
tion in the department. A resolution was
adopted requesting the City Attorney to
take an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Mrs. Morrissey, who was formerly Miss
Mead, was deprived of her position by the
board because she married. Superintend
ent Webster held that a teacher was ap
pointed with the understanding that she
agreed to obey the rules of the board.
Now, one of the rules is that a teacher
who marries while in the department loses
her position. Webster held that this was
a vital point, which Judge Murasky had
not touched upon, and that the Supreme
Court should pass upon it.

BOARD APPEALS
FROM DECISION
"I'm glad to be rid of the woman," said
the Klondike millionaire. "AH I want
now is my furtniture back. She got more
money out of me than I dare tell, but I
have still some left and am going back In
the spring to the Klondike and will no
doubt make more. My ex-wife is not in
town. She has gone down to Los Angeles,
where she Is known once more as Grace
Drummond."
Anderson is the owner of several valu
able claims in the Klondike, and his name
is good on 'change for a sum not exceed
ing a unit and six ciphers. In June, 1S99,
he wooed and won Grace Drum
mond, an "actress," who with her
sisters was doing a turn at the Dawson
Variety Theater. It was a hasty
wooing ' and progressed with unusual
rapidity, aided by the encouraging tinkle
of the gold nuggets Anderson flung at the
feet of the charmer. At the end of six
days of wedded bliss Grace Anderson sud
denly discovered that the severity of a
Dawson winter would mean loss of health
to h,er, and her doting husband let her
come to this city to remain until summer
came round again. Grace asked for $16,
000 for her traveling expenses and she got
it. She came to town, bought things and
asked for more money. This Interesting
programme was kept up until the lady
had obtained about $150,000 of her million
aire husband's Klondike gold, and then
she brought suit for a divorce. The di
vorce was granted on the 8th of March,
and Anderson says that when he gets his
furniture back lie is done with Actress
Grace Drummond forever.
On the Sth of March Anderson lost his
wife through the . medium of the divorce
'court. When the legal separation was
granted it was decided that the hushand
should have the home located at 721 Ash
bury street and all its gorgeous fur
nishings. On Saturday, when Anderson
went to take possession of the house, he
found It in a condition not calculated to
inspire thoughts of home comforts. All
the furniture was gone, the linen had
disappeared, the china and glass closets
were empty and the pictures no longer
adorned the walls. All that remained in
the house were a couple of beds, the car
pets on the floors and a silver-plated tea
spoon. Anderson believed that his ex
wife, with the assistance of "Captain"
Morgan, her brother-in-law, had had the
furniture removed to 52S Golden Gate ave
nue. But when with the aid of a police
officer he made his search yesterday aft
ernoon he found there but a few towels
and sheets, a couple of forks and spoons
and a bronze cuckoo clock. The Klon
diker will continue his search to-day.
Charles J. Anderson, a Klondike mil
lionaire, says ho "wants his furniture
back." and with that end in view he ap
peared before Judge Conlan yesterday
and swore out a search warrant for his
property.whlqh he claims has been stolen.
Will Stand the Loss of His Money,
but Insists That His House
hold Goods Be Re
