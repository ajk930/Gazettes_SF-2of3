happy to welcome her home to her native
port. _ ' . ' . -
"VVith a consistency in keeping with the
nickname of .the "Bulldog of the Navy,"
she added another to her list of surpris
ing feats and appeared off the Golden
Gate most unexpectedly, while a com
mittee of public officials was in meeting,
eagerly planning a reception worthy of
the greatest of battleships. Her arrival,
yesterday afternoon was a surprise, but
the .'deep- voiced chorus of a thousand
whistles bade her welcome, and many a
ferveiit ''God bless her!" arose from the
multitudes who, along the water front,
and on hilltops, watched her stately prog-,
fess Into the harbor. .
j The news, received by telephone from
the Merchants' Exchange, that the Ore

while every steamship in port and every

Rear Admiral Casey's flagship, a salute
was fired. The Oregon then made a circle
around/' the Iowa and Philadelphia and
came to anchor off Steuart-street wharf..
- Her homeward bound pennant streamed
twice the" length of the ship astern." A
magnificent silk flag, the gift, of .the citi

This voyage of 14,000 miles, made In six
ty-six days, reflected the highest credit
cn the men who designed her, on those
who built her and on the officers and men

contracts for the two last \ named were
given to the Cramps of Philadelphia and
the contract for the Oregon to the Union
Iron Works of this city. Her keel was
laid In 1S91 and on October 26, 1S93, she
was put Into the water. When finished
she had a displacement of 11,000. tons, i

was wrought up over the prospect of the
little squadron being intercepted by the

lying at the Cape Verde Islands. -
The Spaniards did not choose to seek an
encounter, however, and on May 24, after
touching at Barbadoes on her way, the
Oregon* reported to Washington her ar
rival at , Jupiter Inlet, near Key West,
Florida, ready for service. She had made
her, marvelous run without an accident or

REGARDING the advantage of a wireless telegraphy system between the Farallon Islands and San Francisco,
via Point Lobos, am pleased to say that I believe, if the system is practicable, its advantage to the shipping
int-^ests would more than justify the expense of construction and maintenance. It is one of the many recent,
â¢advances in electrical science that has practical value, and should be put into operation .wherever it^can be
used to the benefit of our commerce. . . . ' \-. -. ,
The Merchants' Exchange has its lookout station at Point Lobos at a high elevation! and as the.Faral
lone Islands are of sufficient height, the expense of construction would be minimum. The Merchants'. Ex
change has a telephone line, connecting the Point Lobos station with the exchange, so that Â¦ any . messages sent in
could be promptly transmitted to the proper address. . . V Â¦ â¢,' â¢ Â» i( _
I beUeve it to be within the province of this Government to construct such telegraphic , system . for the better
protection of our merchant marine. Also, it would be of advantage to vessels in . the Government -} service, â¢â¢. They
could communicate with or receive orders without the necessity of coming into the harbor. Vesselsjarrlving off the
oort in distress or requiring the services of a tug or other assistance, could, by signaling the. operator. on the islands,
communicate with the city. Vessels coming to this coast In ballast' with Instructions to get their orders off the har
bor (to come in or proceed to Portland or the Sound for their outward cargo) would be saved the inconvenience of
delays Such communication now is generally by ths pilot boats and necessitates considerable loss of time. > '.

REFERRING to -the establishment of â¢ a wireless telegraph" system -!
from the Farallon Islands for the purpose' of advising our Chamber
of Commerce and, the shipping community of the approach of vessels
to our coast. I would say that before'leaving Washington I had sev- "
eral interviews with Professor Willis L. Moore, Chief of the Weather
Bureau in Washington, in relation to- the wireless telegraph. He,
being both a progressive and a scientific man, has been investigating
the practicability of the use of the wireless telegraph to be used by vessels on
the Pacific Coast to advise "us in relation to the cold waves and the condition
of the weather on -the coast of the States of Washington, Oregon and Cali
fornia. The result of his investigations when. I left Â¦ Washington had not
satisfactorily demonstrated to his mind the practicability of asking the Gov- '
ernment for an appropriation, but he hoped' to gather sufficient data to en
able him to make a. favorable repoTt when Congress convenes next December.
Since I have been in Congress I have endeavored to secure. ah appropria
tion for the construction of a cable line from' Point Reyes to the Farallon
Islands, as that seemed to be the most advantageous point on the coast. If
it is not deemed practicable to use the wireless telegraph, then I am. . very"
hopeful that we will be able to secure an appropriation at tho coming session
of Congress this winter for a cable from San Francisco or Point Reyes to the
Farallon Islands. , ' . Â¦ 'Â¦
The experiment or trial now being made by the New York Herald, estab
lishing a wireless telegraph service between Nantucket lightship and the
headland on the island, will demonstrate the practicability of such a service.
.There is no question but what it will come In the near future," buf I think it j
the part of wisdom to wait and profit by the experience of those who are
scientifically investigating the whole subject. GEORGE -C.PERKINS,
United States Senator' from California.
CALIFORNIA SENATOR
FORESEES SUCCESS
THE establishment. by the Xew York Herald of a wireless telegraph
service between Nantucket lightship and a head land on the island
furnishes a suggestion for our own coast, which should be promptly
acted upon, to wit: The establishment of a similar service between
the Farallones and San Francisco. No difficulties present themselves
in establishing and successfully operating such a service here which
have not been met and overcome there. The distance between the
operating points is not . so great here as there, and the conditions of eleva
tion, etc.. are all in our favor. '/
It is not necessary to enumerate here the advantages and benefits to ac
crue from the establishment of such a service. Many of these immediately sug
gest themselves coincidently with mention of it; and, with further thought,
others present themselves, among which will prominently appear the possi
bility of preventing by its aid such terrible disasters as that of the Rio, and
others which have preceded it, at least of diminishing the loss of life in case
of such accidents â the approach of -vessels being announced long In advance,
and their arrival looked for. â¢ ' Â¦ â¢
The subject is one to which my attention has previoftsly been called. Just
before I left Washington last March it formed the subject of a very Inter
esting interview with a gentleman who had given it much intelligent thought
and careful study, with, as it seemed to me at the time, entirely practical
conclusions.
The great desirability of establishing the service being admitted, consid
eration of the means and the successive steps for its speedy realization are
next in order. These> shall at once command my earnest attention, as they
undoubtedly/ will also that of my colleagues, and the result of our co-ope
rative action should greatly aid In securing a consummation in the short
est possible time. .Â» V. H. METCALF,

i . S . president of the Manufacturers' and- Producers' Association, I
A- anv pleased to be able to indorse the admirable plan that The Call
/m _-. suggests for the facilitation of communication between; the Faral-,
.- -ZJl ' lone Islands and the port of San Francisco. Many causes 'have
V^^L made the growing commercial importance of San Farncisco a mat
ter for national concern and pride. "We are facing the Orient, and
that fact alone should be a sufficient incentive for the Government
to take such action as may be necessary Mn the premises. The wonderful
use of electricity in wireless telegraphy has made possible in the near fu
ture that which would *btherwise have been remote. I must applaud thÂ©
enterprise and public spirit of The Call in malting a strong effort* to have
wireless telegraphy applied to the problem of communication for the bene
fit of our shipping, commercial and other material interests. The advan
tages that would come to us from having certain and quick means of hear
ing from our ships and the ships of other nations coming within sighting dis
tance'of the Farallones are too many to be easily enumerated. The estab
lishment of 'stations for the transmission of information between Nan
tucket lightship and the mainland indicates that unless we are equipped
with facilities we _ shall be distanced in very important particulars by the

! ST. PETERSBURG, .June 12.â A small
notice published In the papers here chron
icles Â¦ the result of one of the greatest
pieces of commercial folly on the part of
the. United States which.it is possible to
imagine. That notice tells of an order
of the Minister of Finance raising the tax
on several articles of -American produc
tion, including bicycles, for example, from
20 to 30 per cent, which means .virtually
that they are excluded.
Eighteen millions of dollars' worth of
American trade per annum is for the same
reason brought to an end.
And this is all done upon a pure tech
nicality â upon which most people here be
lieve to be a misunderstanding. r It is all
over the matter of Russian sugar and it
is what is known in trade as "bounty
fed."
Mr. Holloway, United States Consul
here, took upon himself the responsibility
of reporting to the Treasury Department
that Russian exported sugar was indirect
ly "bounty fed." His decision is generally
controverted. In the mean time harm has
been done.
To put the matter simply so that all can
understand it, the case- is this: Russia
guarantees to take from* her sugar pro
ducers so much sugar at a. certain sum,
upon which she places an internal tax.
At the same time she taxes all the sugar
produced. When the manufacturers have
a surplus for exportation that internal tax
is refunded to them. "SK
How such a condition can possibly be
tortured into a bounty is what the people
here cannot understand, bounty being a
sum Daid to stimulate production. A
bounty is paid by Germany to some manu
facturers. For so much exported so much
cash is given per ton to the exporters.
Here the internal revenue tax is merely,
remitted. . .

CALL LEADS IN THE EFFORT TO SECURE THE SERVICE,
WASHINGTON, June 12.â Former Senator
Chandler of New Hampshire, chairman of
the Spanish Claims Commission, has de
cided a controversy as to the authorship
of the words "which we pledge ourselves
10 promote" in the bimetallic plank in the
Republican platform of 1S96, and has
awarded a $100 prize to Senator Lodgre of
Massachusetts. . ....
These words gave to that plank all its
force and cave such Republican advo
cates of bimetallism as Messrs. Chandler
and Wolcott ground for remaining In the
party. When the controversy as to the
authorship of these words was raging,
JTr. Chandler offered a reward of $100 to
the person who established his author
fhip. Mr. Chandler did not consider evi
dence in support of any claim conclusive
until Senator Foraker, chairman of the
I-Iatlorm committee in 18a6, recently found
the original draft, with the words inter
lined. They were unmistakably in the
handwriting of Senator Lodge.
Mr. Chandler sent to the Massachusetts
-Senator his check for $100 yesterday, ac
companied by a letter, in which he says
a'.l wise men know that Messrs. McKinley
and Hobart would not have been elected
if the platform had not contained these
wcrds, and if they had not been elected
in 1!#6 Mr. McKinley would not have been
c lpcled in 1900.
Mr. Chandler expresses the hope that
when all the facts are known, not only
Republicans, but those Democrats who
trembled at the very prospect of the elec
t5on of Mr. Bryan, will adequately recog
nize the "sagacity and courage which led
you not merely to conceii-e, but to actu
ally insert into the platform of 1896 con
cerning bimetallism the words 'which we
pledge ourselves to promote.' " Then he
adds this sarcastic sentence:

Dr. Benjamin F. de Costa delivered his
second lecture of the Catholic Truth So
ciety lecture course last evening before a
large and Interested audience In -Metro
politan Temple, the subject being- "The
VaHcan Archives and the. Papal Bulls Re
lating to Pre-Columbian America." ' . ,
Frank J. Kierce", vice president of the
Catholic Truth Society, introduced the
speaker of the evening.
Dr. de Costa in the course of his lec
ture affirmed that it was an incontrovert
ible fact .that European civilization was
represented in the Western world in pre-
Columbian" times; that this civilization
was the exclusive product of the Catholic
church, which, und^er â¢ a succession ; of
bishops, was maintained for many genera
tions in Greenland, where there was a
cathedral, \ the ruins of which remain to
day, besides sixteen parish churches. Â»
A similar statement was made respect
ing the representation of the Catholio
church on the mainland of America by
both the Irish and Scandinavians and the
speaker declared that New England was
reached by Bishop Eric and other Catholic
missionaries. - ,
The speaker said also that it was highly
probable that the system of collecting
tithes in Greenland for the Crusades was
employed in New England. He argued
further that the supremacy of the Pope
was reedgnized in America in pre-Colum
bian times, as It Is to-day.
Greenland was discovered In 983 by Eric
the Red, who had been banished from Ice
land for manslaughter, the 'speaker said.
Eric returned to -Iceland, announced his
discovery and brought back with him to
the new - country several priests. The
country was rapidly settled and several
excursions were made from Greenland to
the coast of New England. The first pil
grimage from America was made by' an
Icelandic nun, who went from New Eng
land to Rome. . .
"All the records of the Holy See prior
to the year 1206 A. D. have disappeared,"
said the speaker. "The archives of the
Vatican are absolutely free for the in
spection of the public. The Vatican is no
conspiracy against history; it has nothing
to conceal. There is nothing in the secret
archives of which the Catholic church
need be afraid or ashamed. They are be
ing consulted daily by students and phil
osophers. If the archives of Rome had
remained intact they, would have shown
that communication with America had
been kept up through Greenland and Ice
land."
Speaking of the discovery of Iceland and
Greenland, Dr. de Costa said that it was
being proved by recent researches that
the Irish discovered Iceland and Green
land before the Norsemen did.
Â¦, "There is hardly a nook or a corner in
the United States that is not now being
visited â¢ by some Irish priest,"- said the
speaker.

Allow me to inform you that should you
have your .proposals for hay made to the
farmer about the middle of June you will save
thousands of dollars yearly, as the farmer can
p*1I the hay at from $3 to 15 per ton cheaper
than the Hay Association of thirteen firms
asks you for the same hay. Deal direct with
the producer, as a grreat many of them are
taspajers of your city and county.
A letter was received yesterday by the
Board of Supervisors from E. M. Plercy
of San Jose, in which he advises as fol
lows regarding the excessive bids filed for
hay to be supplied to the city:
Lower Bates on Hay.
The City Attorney advises me that he will
appeal the case affecting the right of the Re
corder to appoint copyists outside of the civil
fervice. Therefore I request you not to pay
t!iÂ«Â» demand in question or any other demands
Tor salaries of Recorders' copyists who have
not be-^n certified by the Civil Service Commls
rlon Pending a decision by the Supreme
Court all doubts should be resolved by admin
istrative officers in favor of the civil service
provisions of the charter.

of noble grand arch. . For the office

candidates C. Guglielmoni of Monte Verde
Grove, George Beck of Livermore Grove
and C. C. O'Donnell of Norma Grove. For
grand secretary John , M. Graves of Mo
desto Grove, the incumbent, will be a
candidate for re-election and he probably
will be chosen by acclamation, as no one
will be placed in nomination against* him.
F. J. Horn of Hesperian Grove, the in

It is thought that there will be but lit
tle legislation during the session, as it is
believed that the laws as they now stand
will serve the order for another year.v '
Several interior cities will make an ef
fort to secure the next session of the
'grand body. The most prominent candi
dates are Stockton. Santa Rosa and Sa
linas. San Francisco will also be placed
in nomination. . ,
On Tuesday evening there will be a spe
cial session of Hartnagle Chapter, the
highest degree of Druidism, for the pur
pose of receiving into it a class of eli
gibles; on Wednesday afternoon there
will be a. meeting of the Past Arches' As
sociation to admit a number of the repre
sentatives to the Grand" Grove, and on
that evening there will be a reception in
Odd Fellows' Hall to the grand officers
and the representatives to the Grand
Grove and the Grand Circle. A ball will
follow the reception.
Grand Grove of California,
I United Ancient Order of Druids,
I will meet in annual session in the
LL Druidic Temple on Sutter street
next Tuesday. This jurisdiction
has now eighty-six groves as against sev
enty-nine at the opening of the previous
session. Eight new groves were instituted
during the year and one surrendered Its
charter. ; The membership at this time is
nearly 6000. During the term of the pres
ent noble grand arch, Henry Lange,
there were 1200 initiations and the rein
statement of 200 suspended members,
which Is equal to 1400 new members. Aa
an offset there was the loss of one grove"
with 70 members and the suspension of 460
members on account of neglect to pay
dues, leaving a net gain of 870.
aTS Ine^ e Consul General Ho Tow has
dec ared diplomatic war against Customs
< ollector Stratton because of a difference
Â«f opinion between them respecting the
â¢J-t Â° ShIh Ch ' n> the reform leader.
The Collector has expressed the opinion
for publication that, under the terms of
the exclusion laws, he is not bound to
notice the fact that Su is or Is not a re
former or a revolutionist, so longr as he
holds thr certificate required by law for
h!s admissicn as .-Â» member of a non-ex
i-Iutfed oJufe.
Ho Yow thinks differently. He has ex
cused the Collector of discriminating, and
lias filed a formal complaint with the Sec
retary of the Treasury against the Col
lector.
fact is," said Ho Yow yesterday,
"that the section 6 certificate presented
by Su Shih Chin was obtained by fraud
from the Chinese Government, and sec
ondly, it is irregular on its face. Real
merchants have been denied a landing
here because their papers have been Ir
regular in form, and they will have a
right to kick if the Collector passes over
the matter of the irregularity in the form
of Su's certificate."
The following protest was telegraphed
last Tuesday evening by Ho Yow to the
Secretary of the Treasury:
IMPERIAL. CHINESE CONSULATE.
SAX FRANCISCO, June 11. 1901.
Hon. Secretary of Treasury, Washington, D.
C: Tour telegram received. Collector decided
or recommended case of Su Shih Chin with
out calling or hearing our evidence, although
I hed filed charges with him & few days pre
vious, but will do eo now. We allege his sec
tion 6 papers are obtained by fraud, besides
being irregular in form. Chinese Minister at
Washington could be communicated with for
further evidence, as he could ascertain the
genuineness of the papers from our Govern
ment or the Customs Taotal at Shanghai, who
issued these papers to Su Shih Chin. I respect
fully submit that you request the Collector
to forward the criminal certificates in dispute
with all others. Please defer decision until
facts or evidence arrive from China. Respect
fully. HO YOW.
Imperial Chinese Consul General.
Yesterday morning- the following note
was handed to the Collector by the Chi
nese Consul General:
IMPERIAL, CHINESE CONSULATE.
SAX FRANCISCO. June 12. 1901,
Hon. F. S. Stratton. Collector of Customs â
Dear Sir: Your favor of yesterday's date vas
duly received about 4 p. m.. notifying me of
your desire to accord me a hearing in the case
of Su Shih Chin. In it you also stated your
impression that I only withdrew our guaranty
â¢â¢as to the ofScial character of Su Shih Chin,"
and merely desired his case to follow the or
oir.ary procedure where applicants present
themselves for landing."
It ie true to a certain extent that I inti
mated this, but even if it were so my letter
to you about this man sets down many charges,
besides stating he is not a bona fide official.
In examining into his case as ordinary ap
plicants for landing I had hoped in fairness
to all concerned that you would look for evi
dence material to this case and in the quarter
in which you are aware you could obtain and
hear both or all sides of the case before you
report or recommend the case to the Treasury
Department. Many real Chinese merchants
coming under the same section 6 papers have
been denied a landing for slighter causes be
fore. But as you have an independent au
thority and power to regulate and decide all
ordinary Chinese cases it would be discourteous
for me or any outsider to comment or inter
fere with your procedure, but since you have
mentioned the matter in your kind favor of
. yesterday I respectfully take the liberty of
Ttuchtnc tipen it. .- â
Too are kind enough in the same note to
. accord me the privilege of fixing the day and
hour for a hearing, to which I beg the liberty
of naming Thursday at 2:30 p. m., which I
tiape will be agreeable to you. Respectfully,
HO YOW.
Imperial Chinese Consul General.
In response to the diplomatic note the
Collector fixed to-day at 2:30 p. m. as the
time for the examination of Su's papers.
"If his papers are regular," said the j
Collector yesterday, "I can see no reason
Â¦why he should not be allowed to land. I
cannot go into' the question as to whether
he is a reformer or not. I shall then
transmit the evidence to Washington, as
the Secretary of the Treasury has ex
pressed a desire to pass upon this case
himself." ' -
Ho Yow insists that Su is an outlaw
and should not be admitted on any papers
purporting to have been issued or in
dorsed by the Chinese Government.

MRS. NATION'S LAST CHANCE.
Government . cannot consider "extremes alone, yet
it, is Mrs. Nation's idea tHat" only'' the" abnormal. is
normal.
But hers is a mistaken theory. It is not only well
but necessary to base j conclusions tip'ori the average
;ind nct-upon the extreme. of human experience. All
arc not happy," and- all are 'not unhappy. All women
have not â¢ witnessed the alcoholic extinction of one
husband.' and perhaps been physically disciplined! by,
another, and all grandmothers have ,not had frivolous
grandsons, whose sole gift was in making a cocktail
move itself aright and show its ; color. in the cup.
If all lives had touched and' sliared. an equal series
of abnormalities she would-be everywhere welcome
as an cxpcrt.in morbid experiences. Her government
will naturally, be based upon thcprinciple that all peo
ple have lived and endured as she has. That'is the
theory of her /crusade. * - The ..Jate ;Immanuel Kant
would say that what lx> her is posteriori she assumes
to be a priori to all others.
In' Bryan's State a town -of 1200 inhabitants at the
tprih'g'election nominated and elected a ticket pledged
to import. Mrs. Nation and consult her and follow, her
advjee in everything pertaining to the government of
the municipality. The officers so chosen have organ
ized and notified the lady to come, and stand ad- 1
journe4 .trtitil she appears, -with hatchet in her hand
and blood in her cyi. The officers explain to their,
constituents that they will not move a wheel until
they get her advice. As her -knowledge of laws and
constitutions has not been shown to exceed that of*
Moses, Solon, Justinian, Honorius and other prac
titioners^-ancient and modern, it is not probable that
she will be subject to the limitations which such
knowledge implies in putting in practice this novel
scheme of government. It will be, in fact, a
Carnation set up within the State of Nebraska and
exceptional to all the statutory regulations governing
municipalities. What she says goes, and that's the end
of it. It- will-be' interesting to >watch the smasher as
she enters upon and rules her new estate. Perhaps
her somewhat varied and unfortunate personal expe
rience^ will be the guide of her new jurisdiction. Her
first husband floated hence on the flowing bowl, and it
is alleged that her second applied physical discipline
to her to such an extent that Texas refused to con
tain him; and her grandson r mixes drinks in a Chicago
joint/. ' Â¦";â¢ \- : , . ... .. : . ' .". .,; . Â¦â¢ Â¦;'-â¢ Â¦'' Â¦
While she bandied; words . with Justices of' "the
Peace or browbeat Judges she amused the multitude.
While, she cheerfully consigned smokers and drinkers
to ircIUshe awestruck the many who -still believe in the
mysterious, and fear the power of prophets, seers and
rcvclators. ' But all that time she had no real dis
ciplesj and. even Mr. .Nation growled about the ex
pense arid pointed to his buttonless trousers and un
washed Shirts. But all this is changed. The prophet
ess is not without honor, though it comes from out
side her own cpuntry. The stone fined by a Kansas
court has been laid' for a corner in Nebraska.
While Mrs. Nation went around playing a resound
ing solo with her hatchet she was an object of interest
or of fear, according to the, point of view.
But the novel and extraordinary in moral and po
litical* reform never goes aright until it secures dis
ciples!
SINXE Mrs.. Nation was actually fined by a court,
and Mr. Nation fled from the conjugal presence
to live with his children, there has been some
danger of that energetic lady and her hatchet passing
from public view. \ . *. * .
ONLY a short time ago Prince Krapotkin in an"

utterly worthless country/and intimated that'

sians are making much ado about- nbtliing.- Now>
however, comes a report that the "Russian Government
thinks so much of the provinceand its trade that ar-"
rangements have been made at St. Petersburg': to.es- ."
tablish at Kirih, one of the largest tofyns "of Mail-**

appears from the report that the*Russians have
found the market of Manchuria "flooded with foreign
goods,", and that the " amount- of American, British,
German and Chinese goods sold there is sufficient to
make it worth while for. the Russians to struggle" to
supplant "them. One authority saysio. '.'A;iarge por-'
tion of the foreign goods which Russia is endeavoring
to drive out of the Manchurian market is supplied:
from the United States." ; ;"(* / , .>,
All of that sounds as if Manchuria were a' very rich
country* with a wonderful* commercial .^future .
Prince Krapotkin. tells a different story.; He' explored
the' country, several years ago while in the .Russian
military service. He went up the River Sungari as-far-
as this" same' town of Kirin, where t the^exposition 'is to
be established. In .describing* the "country he ? saysr
"Immense stretches of a 1 high, cold -arid-'- marshy"

MANCHURIA AN0MTS CTRADE:
WOMEN FOR SOUTH AFRICA.
EVER since Chamberlain niade his famous
speech suggesting an extensive emigration of
British women to South Afriea as soon as the
war is over there has been an organized effort to edu
cate women for the work likely to be required of them
should they decide upen the venture. The instruction
has been undertaken by* the United British Women's
Emigration Society, and is being carried out with en
ergy. The number of women who have applied for.
instruction is large, and most of them arc said to be of
a high order of ability, .for the society* discourages
Avoinen of the servant class owing to the.fact that there
is an. abundance of labor of that kind already in the
country. Â¦ ..â.".. â â¢
The secretary of the society in explaining the work
to the London Chronicle, said recently: ,"We. welcome
the time which must necessarily elapse before the
country will have settled down to industry, for we do
not want to send out a number of raw, untrained
women. As:it is, we are enabled to encourage them to
train for definite occupations. Just now, by means of
a pamphlet written by. Lady Knightley of JFawsley we
are appealing for. the active :co-operatidn \ of - : ladies
throughout .the; country in enabling intending emi
grants to obtain instruction in' various departments of
practical .life, such as" cooking, , dairying, poultry
keeping, "bread-making, laundry "work, needlework,
cutting-out;, gardening, fruit-packing, bee-keeping and
nursing.- In some parts of the country County Coun
cil classes for technical instruction provide the readiest
meanlj of 'gaining instruction."
' /Tfte^Wotneh's Emigration Society was not called
into existence. for the purp"o"Se of promoting emigra
tion to >5outh Africa.; It existed long before the war
and has been assisting the migration of 'women from
the old country to the colonies.'' There are over 1,000,
ooomore women than men. in the kingdom, while in
,the colonies'. there is;* lack of wonien, v and the emigra
tion is therefore beneficial both to the old and to the
new countries. ; The South "African movement has
grown* up J ! out of tile war and is part of a general
s'cheme to encourage the. settlement of "^British families
in the'eountry to counteract the Dutch element of the
population and make the country surely. â¢British;, ; ,
.While the main society in London is educating the
girlsat home for the work there are branch societies
in Cape' Colony and i other important' points in South
Africa" making, preparations to receive them.! .There
is -said- to be" a great-demand for teachers, and quite a
number of them have volunteered. In ... addition the
.volunteers include housekeepers, nurses, bookkeepers,
stenbgraphers,"iypists and journalists. Mn short/there
is a grand army of women ready to move to South
Africa as, soon as the waris over, "but from the pres
ent outlook they will Have; ample time to pursue their
education in London before the establishment of peace
requires them to start for. their.; hew!. homes.
AFTER her glorious voyage around the Horn,
her share in the victory at Santiago and her
service in the Orient, the peerless Oregon has
returned to San Francisco to' rest for a time in the
bay that first received her. It is right and fitting that
her return; was greeted- by ' a distinguished welcome,
for slier has % reflected .Â£<?Â£ much honor upon the Â£ort
where" sTiV was" built "that she deserves honors in re
turn.
In the navies of the world many a battleship floats
upon the waters, but of them all the Oregon is at this
time supreme." It is undeniable that she is the most
famous warship upon the, seas. Her voyage around the
Horn was^a magnificent triumph of speed and en
durance. No other vessel of her class has had her
machinery and her hull so continuously and so , tre
mendously tested, or has borne the test with such re
markable success. She made a voyage which in. itself
amazed the naval experts of the world, and at the end
of it she arrived xipon the scene of war not only fit
to enter battle but did actually enter battle and stand
pre-eminent in the conflict.
â¢ The oldest and the greatest ship-building ports in
the world would be proud of constructing such a
vessel as the. Oregon. It is therefore but,natural that
San Franciscp should feel a joy in her matchless feats
and her peerless position among .the' warships of the
time.. She attests the skill and fidelity of our mechan
ics and ship-builders not less than the", courage and
seamanship of her commander and her; crew. She
was built stanch and strong in every part of her com
plex mechanism, a fit upholder of the flag of the re
public, and it is with a patriotic satisfaction as well
as a civic pride we welcome her home again.

COLLEGE AND UXIVERSITY-J. H..
City. In order to determine If a. certain
college leads a certain State university in
the same studies, taught m both, It would
require an examination into the methods
in each branch in each institution, the
number of students . in each particular
class and the percentages for a number
of years. That Is a task that this de

FOREIGN POPULATIONâ Subscriber.
City. Until the details of the census for
1900 are Issued from the Census Bureau
it will be impossible to give the number of
foreigners in the United States or the
number of naturalized citizens. The per
centage of the foreign born population,
according to the census of 1890. was U.S.
An estimate made at the close of 1900
placed the percentage at 13.4. It will take
the official figures to determine how near
correct that estimate is.

bring about , eating and drinking. When
people ,ask< me." about smoking, I am apt
to say that I wish they would not smoKe,
but that any man who can go without his
pipe or his, cigar for. six months and not
miss it may smoke. If he cannot, why
the "poor critter" is a slave, and the first
thing he has to do is to free himself from
that exact slavery. This rule applies pre
cisely in. all matters of food.
Â¦ And the reason is very subtle which pre
vents us from applying it in questions as
to habits of drinking. A man who has
smoked one cigar can determine as well
whether he shall take a second as if he
had not, been smoking. But a man who
has drunk one glass of whisky cannot, de
termine as to the second glass as well as
he could as, to the first. Here is one rea
son why he had better determine in early
life that until he is 65 years old he will
drink no' alcoholic spirits. J He will take it
if the physician insists upon it, but on no
other condition. You see that'nobody pre
tends that the "stimulus of wine or dis
tilled : liquor Is, any thing but a stimulus.
When you take a glass of wine or a glass
of whisky to ..brace up for. a- particular
effort, you-are simply. borrowing from to
morrow. Now, if. a woman is thrown cu:
of a carriage on herhead and Is senseless,
it may be .well to give her come brandy
so .that she can borrow from to-morrow's
resources in pulling herself together this
afternoon. But It is Only in suÂ«h an excep
tional case that one has any right to bor
row to-day from' to-morrow's resources. ,
Habits of Thought and Study.
I think that the school hours of our life
in cities axe too many for boys and girls
who go to school forty-four weeks in the
year.' In the better system of the older
country districts, where a school is closed
after, thirteen weeks* . winter study, and
not opened again until after a long period
of work on the farm or in the household,
why, there is no harm in seven or even
eight hours a day for study, while the
scholars ar-i at school. . - â <*'
A certain dawdling habit comes In. with
the long scaool session which is bad all
around. And many a boy and girl has to
break up this habit, and turn over a new
leaf when they form the habit of reading,
writing and thought upon which they arc
to go through life. _. .
In the first place, let nobody bo gloomy
because he has not " more .than two or
three hours for study in every day. I do
not say that' a man needs. no more, If he
be working out some of the great prob
lems or enterprises. If a. man were de
signing a new locomotive, -or if he were
contriving a new J pattern for a dollar
watch, or devising a new light like Edi
son's, he would give much more, than
three hours a day for stiff brain work â
for study.
But this does not mean that* a man
needs .more than two or three hours a
day, for book study. "Sunday will come
in, .as Andrew Fairservice says, and that
will give him more. In the Chautauqua
courses, which have proved very well de
vised for the average American working
man, we find, that eight closely applied
reading hours in a week will meet our re
quisitions, though we ask for more. I
know thai almost anybody, however
much occupied, can get fourteen .reading
hours every week, and for people who
come to me for advice I order that, as'if
I were a doctor with a prescription blank,
and Rx at the top of it.
Hours of Reading and Study.
As to the "hours of reading or careful
study, man or woman must take it when
they can. You are always safe, however.
If you can leave your bed ' so early aa to
get an hour for reading or writing or
study before you go to your day'a regu
lar work. Only you must take some food
before you begin to work your brain.
You nre on ticklish ground again If you
work the bruin hard in the houra before
sleep. This haa been raid already and. the
reason given.
Hut simple reading,' for the acquisition
of knowledge or for pleasure, does not
work or tire the brain. Heading aloud In
the evening Is an excellent habit In the
family for the lust hour or hours of a
day.
It is all very well to be an all-round
mnn or wom.ui, and to keep, in a way,
even with what the world la doing In its
larger Interests. But all the same, who
ever takes life seriously will be wise if he
determines that he will keep himself well
Â¦up on some one special lines of study
wnich Interests him. Is It flowers, Is It
the care of bees, is it trees, is it grass, Is
It local history, is it history of the na
tion, is It the tariff, la it municipal light
ing? 1 do not know. You know what you
like, what interests you. You know what
will be of use In your daily occupation.
You know how you can help the neigh
bors and -make. the town a better town.
If you know that you know what is your
special line of reading, or, if you .please,
of study. And my advice is that you
form the habit of keeping up your read
ing in that direction.
To Keep the Machine in Order.
Any one 'who knows a bicycle ought to
know enough of the machine to keep it in
order. He" need not be a machinist, but
he may need to take off a nut, or to put
it on. he needs to know. when and where
to ell, and how much oil to use.
. Now the same thing is true of mind and
body, which is the machine which man,
the soul, has to use. He may not know
how many bones he has, or where ; the
sciatic nerve divides. But he is the mas
ter. .The nerves and bones and brain are
not masters. â¢ He is to tell them what ; to
do, and he is to keep them iir order. He
will have full power to do this if he keep
in touch with the God from whom he is
born. He is a child of God. God wishes
to help him through if he will, let him.
Thus the man succeeds in whatever Is in
hand, because he brings to bear infinite
power.
When I was in Salignac's drill corps in
1S61 we came at last, to our great joy, to
the business of firing the old Springfield
arms which they drilled us with. And of
cours'e we had to pull the triggers. And
of course Salignac wanted us to pull them
at the same instant, the same forty-seven
thousandth fraction of a quarter second.
And he said: "Don't pull as if. you only
wanted to start the hammer. Pull,,' each
of you; as if you were starting a hundred
pound weight." Â¦ .Â¦....Â¦ ,

into every-day language, It means. ."Use

Union of Body, Mind and Soul.
I havyqbeen asked to write a few words,
not too many, ..on regular habits in the
training of life, as they look to an old man
who never had to go to bed in the day
time and who never "enjoyed ill^health."
-Body, mind and soul all -belong togeth
er; and we are fools if we try to separate
them. "We must take care of them to
gether. We must train them together. We
do not want first-rate gymnasts or ath
letes, unless they are first-rate men; we
do not want expert calculators or bril
liant authors unless they are first-rate
men; and we. have no use for the monk
of the middle ages who spent day and
night 'in prayer and meditation, with a
body which has no nerve or muscle or go
and a mind which was addled and vague
in its spasmodic action. This man, with
his cosseting of what he called his soul,
was not a first-rate man, nor a second
rate-mnn. It is only by a stretch of,lan
guage that. he is called a man at all.
Wise -Bodily Habits.
The reader will please . remember this
necessity of absolute union of the three
in the business we have in hand, although
our work, of course, arranges itself under
aifferent heads. While we are talking
about bodily exercise" we are not forget
ting hiental exercise or spiritual exercise.
And while we are gaining strength on
either side, we must gain it on- the other
sldes'also. ' . :
To begin with bodily strength and the
health of this part of the machine, I al
ways begin any instructions for a strong,
well and happy life by the praise of sleep
and by insisting that my pupil shall learn
to sleep well. All things seem to follow
on this; and yet sleep also depends on a
well-trained mind" and on Â¦ a determined
soul, able, willing and glad to control
mind and body.
.People woo sleep: they call sleep fickle
or inconstant, and in various ways abuse
it. They make ridiculous proverbs! which
imply that there is something vlrtu6us-in
short nights, as if sleep were to be kept 1
at bay. All this is wrong. Sleep is the
restoration of lifeâ call It, if you please,
the governor of the engine. With the
right sleep and enough of it the body
comes up to its work every morning new
born. In the first half of life it comes up
to Its work a little better able to do Its
duty than the morning before. But this
Is not so if the sleep has not been sound
and steady.
Every one will find out how much -sleep
Is good for him. Then ho will make it
his duty or business to take -that amount
regularly. A leader of men fixed it In
my hearing last night as twelve hoxirs
out of the twenty-four. This is ns much
a duty ns to eat enough or to drink
enough, or to come into the house when
It ruins.;
Rules for Sleeping- Well.
The rules ns 1 have found thorn are sim
ple; They aro well Inltl down in more
than one book. .Dr. .Hammond's ts as
good ns any:
1. Do not work the bruin for six hours
before you ro to bod. Husinoss men, po
called, are ant to violate this rule. The
agents of banks and othor great financial
trusts think they must Klve daylight to
their employers*, nml then spend their
evenings In memoranda, and calculations
about their own personal affairs. * \ All
this is wrong. You, may get out of bed
as early as you please, and work your
brnin *hen. . But you are safeBt if after
\ or A o'clock in the afternoon "you give
it no hard work at all. Are there not the
children to play with and novels to read
and Joe Jefferson at the theater and the
sofa to He upon while Marlon and Hugh
play a duet, upon the. piano? Do not
work this poor old brain then,- which has
stood Jay you so loyally since you got
out of bed In the morning.
2. Remember always . what the bed is
for and why you are in it. You "are
there to sleep; not to add -up figures in
your head. Not to think out a letter to
your lawyer." Not to work out the best
way of putting your house lots on. the
market. Simply you are there to sleep.
3. If you . have Â¦ been working the poor
old brain too late, or If you have been
eating a Welsh rarebit just 1 before you
undressed- yourself, and if your head
burns so that if almost sets the pillow
on fire, crawl out . of ; bed and sponge
your head' with cold; water. At the
worst,- soak the feet in as hot water as
they 'Will. bear. You want to :' draw
away the extra. blood from the brain. In
all natural sleep there is less blood on
the brain than when you are awake. , I
have - at my bedpost a long cord with a
child's :flatiron attached to.it. When my
head is too hot I hold" the smooth, cold
surface of the iron against the forehead
to drive the blood awav.
4.*People tell you to Â¦ think of sheep
jumping over a wall, to "reproduce famil
iar strains of music, to hold the eyes open
and fixed on some object opposite in the
room. riiRecall the. last ridiculous vision
you had before waking. But do not en
gage while in bed in any such serious
matter which will again exhaust and ex
asperate the brain. .; | . ".- v "
.Why Mian \ Can Do as He Chooses.
Here the reader stops and sa'ys: "This
mail saysdo this, but do not do that. Does
the man think I can do just what I
choose?" ..'." ' V .,.'...
Certainly 'I do. That is just 'what the
man is writing for. Are you not a child
of God, "made in his likeness? Can you
not call on his own strength to- put you
through? ..'.'If you choose" . you can, and
just what we are trying for is to find out
where you need that strength and hOw to
use it. In all such rules as we are put
ting, together here It is taken for granted
that, they are to be put through; : -
As. to sleep, then, I will, take It for
granted' that you get as many hours as
you need; ,Â¦ Some people need more, some
less.' Young people , need more than old
people. For myself, I take ten hours out of
the twenty-fourâ one after my luncheon
or midday dinner, nine between 9:39 'at
night and 6:30'in the morning. . â¢ â¢. -
Settle v that . matter Â¦ as â¢ you need. But
settle It. Hold, on by, your omnipotent
power. Â¦ If the - factory bell requires 6
o'clock, ;or. your work with hand or foot
or brain -requires 5 o'clock, -6 or 5 let it
be! ?Do not change your mind every morn
ing.":, Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦ 'â¢":;'. : . ' .'"Â¦ : :"" " ; " 'â¢'. \_' Â¦:'Â¦ ".
And it is always a good thing, if half a
dozen -' people r or more or less.* can agree>
on this: If they willsay; "We will meet
at 5, at 6, at 7 for breakfast," at whatever
hour, they all "choose. - In that case it is
much easier to hold the rule.--. 'i
\ This is to say, in other words, that it is
a good thing, to live at home; . or, in some
family wych takes on the habits of home.
Habits of Appetite.
-Talking thus of habits and sleep, I'have
said i what I : need not repeat i of " habl ts of
appetite and;habits of exercise.

be ' hla | own' master so â¢ completely that - he

LISTING- THE TOWN.
B7Y the activity in this city, of a lady engaged in
- getting up an entertainment for the benefit of
...the University Mound- OW Ladies' Home
there ha^been introduced to San Francisco an indus
try which in the East is known as "listing the town.'^
The business is simple and . easily understood." The
promoter of the scheme arranges with some well estab
lished charity for" the use of its name in getting up'an
entertainment and then proceeds to list the town and
sell tickets right and left. The charity receives a lump
sum or a percentage en the sales of seats, , or both,
and the promoter gets whatever there is in excess of
those amounts. As the American people are ever
liberal in support of local charities, it will be perceived
that the business of working up such entertainments
can readily be made profitable.
Charity by. percentage may be acceptable in the
East, but it is not needed here, and our charitable as
sociations should not lend their names to the pro
moters of such schemes. If there were no other ob
jection to the method it would be. objectionable from
the very fact that by lending their names and giving
indorsement to such promoters the . local charities
would encourage the practice," and- before long evils
would result. Business men and others who have
been ready to * support our home institutions would
not know to whom they were called on to give money
or for what they were giving.it. There would be no
ready way of determining. a meritorious enterprise of
that kind from one promoted solely to make money
for the promoter, and as a consequence .there would
soon be a lack of public confidence which would re
sct to the injury of home charities. .
; The main objection to percentage charity is that
even when honorably conducted" it means that a por
tion of the money that should go to the home institu
tion will pass to another beneficiary. The local char
ity receives only a percentage of the income. Our
business men would thus be called upon to sustain
not only the home charities but to pay for the privi
lege of- doing it. There would be an added burden
upon the communityâ a burden uncalled for, unneces
sary and unjustifiable.
Had the merchants and others of the city who are
relied upon to contribute to every form of charitable
work been illiberal or backward in their. contributions,
perhaps it would be advisable to call in a professional
promoter to raise funds, but no such condition ex
ists. Our people have been generous and prompt in
responding to every rightful appeal made to them in
such cases. No community sustains in proportion to
its population a more abundant charity by voluntary
contribution than does San Francisco.. The.calls.upon
our merchants are many, and it is not fair to add to
them by asking them to purchase tickets for percent
age entertainments. There are some-forms of activity
developed in the East of which we can well afford
to allow our Eastern friends to enjoy the monopoly,
and this is one of them.-

arid engrossed in its decision of. the island cases
-tOjSUch.an extent that contemporary decisions of vast
importance are^not considered. One of them; of far
reaching influence, has just been rendered" by 'Hon.
Smith McPherson, Judge of. the United States Dis
trict Court for the Southern District of Iowa. -It re
verses all the courts in a matter that has been the
subject of a vast mass of litigation.
Life insurance policies contain a suicide clause,
providing that if the policy holder take his own life,
sane or insane, the insurance contract *is vitiated' and
the policy is void.
life : insurance contract peculiarly Â¦affects .third
parties. The second party to such a contract, the per
son insured, cannot get any value received out of a
life policy that runs to the surviving ""beneficiaries.
Their interests, then, are affected by the form of con
tract made by the policy holder, and it is their interest
with which the courts deal in life insurance .litigation.
A contract of life Insurance- containing the suicide
clause was litigated before Judge -McPherson and he
decided the clause void, 1 because a sane man cannot
make a contract that. shall bind an insane man; while
sane he cannot bind himself not* to do certain things
if he become insane and malic that Jhe essence of a
contract. ' ' " ,
The insurance contract was held valid and the policy
payable to its beneficiaries. We think that the equity
of this decision will be seen a^t once and that insur
ance companies will abandon that clause in their con
tracts. â¢ . . â¢
Illuminated by. Judge McPherson's decision it is
plainly seen that an insurance contract might as well
provide that it is to be void if the insured die of any
other disease besides mental disorder. Mental and
physical diseases may come against all human precau
tion, and to bind a man not to die of insanity through
suicide is like binding him not to die of any other
disease. In the nature of things such an, undertaking
is impossible, and such a contract is against good
conscience and public policy.
The Judge has risen above technicality, disregarded
stare decisis, precedent and settled rules, to rise into
the higher atmosphere of legal principles and bring
down therefrom an application of the science that is
as novel as it is necessary to the doing of justice.
It will be seen in the future that the application of
this principle will affect the contractual relation in
other directions, and wherever carried and properly
applied it will be found. serving the ends of pure jus-
tice. ~. ..

Choice Property, at 14- -Montgomery street.Superintendent Webster desired . to
know if the charges were sworn to, say
ing that there is a definite procedure to
be observed , by law. Miss McKenzie
asked for three days' time N to answer the
charges. Vice-Principal Moores was anx
ious that the charges be heard Immedi
ately, but the hearing nas postponed un
til July 1, 190rT
After the meeting adjourned Director
Kincaid asked Moores if he had any re
port cards, and he admitted that- he had
been rather negligent in their prepara
tion. Moores attributes the failure of so
many pupils to pass the examination to
over-grading. There -were ninety pupils
in the eighth Trade, divided into two sec
tions, over which he and Miss Coleman
presided. He says sixty pupils graduated
during the year out of the 500 In the ten
classes, and ne regards that as a fair
proportion. Director Casserly said that
seven-tenths of the pupils in one section
and two-thirds in the other failed to qual
ify for the high school at the examina
tions. When the hearing comes up on
July 1 the accused. teachers will have the
option of a private or public investiga
tion. Director Kir.caid says It will not
So grave did the board consider , the
charges that it immediately passed a res
olution directing the accused teachers to

noon for the purpose of replying- to the
complaint. Miss McKenzie and Vice-

after the complaint was read they were

the month of June is a delightful time of
the year In the mountains. It is a hot and
generally dusty one In the plains and

valley Is therefore worthy of careful con

is the most direct to the valley and is
singularly free from dust. The scenery
along the road from the first station at
the .summit of Priest's Hill- to the very
entrance to the, valley cannot be sur

has increased to such an extent that the

NETTIE B. CBAVEN TVTAKES
' MOTION FOR A TRANSFER
Avers Judge Troutt Is Prejudiced
. Against HeÂ» as Evidenced in
Has Decision*.
Mrs. Nettie H. Craven has again made
appearance in the litigtLtion -over the
estate of the late James G. Fair. -She
filed a motion in Judge Troutt' s court yes
terday asking for a transfer from that de
partment of the Superior Court to some
other department of the petition filed by
Theresa A. Oelrichs, Virginia Vanderbilt
and Charles L.. Fair for distribution to
them of the personal property belonging
to the estate of the deceased millionaire.
In her petition for a: transfer Mrs.
Craven that during the hearing of
the petition for the distribution of the per
sor-al property of James- G. Fair's estate
the court will be called upon to determine
the claim of the petitioner that she is the
widow of the deceased. She is entitled to
a ' transfer - of the' case, she says, on ac
count of the prejudice of Judge Troutt,
which she avers is evidenced in his de
cision heretofore filed in the matter of her
application for a ' family allowance, in
which Judge Troutt'held that the law and
the facts"presented during the hearing of,
the case demonstrated to his satisfaction
that the claims of the petitioner were not
based on facts.
Judge Troutt continued the motion for a
transfer of the petition for distribution
until this morning, at which time It will
be argued. One of Mrs. Craven's attor
neys stated yesterday that Mrs. Craven
was financially able to carry on the flght
for a "vindication" for an unlimited time
and, in the opinion of the attorney, would
eventually accomplish her purpose. 1 **

captain. George Wheeler; pilot. Clarence
Fulton; chief engineer, James O'Xeill;
first assistant engineer, H. James; pur
ser, C. X. Hatch, and chief steward.tE.
M. Keith. Mr. Keith was with Captain
Hatch on the Sound fifteen years ago.
The Frisbie is owned by Hatch Bros.,
owners of the Monticello. The latter
boat is to be overhauled and will run to
Vallejo and on excursions in conjunction
with the General Frisbie.
The General Frisbie Is named after the
founder of Vailejo, who, years ago,
named the town alter his father-in-law,
General Vallejo. She is 170 feet over all,
26 feet beam, 13 feet deep, and Is licensed
to carry 450 passengers. On occasion,
however, a special license can be pro
cured to carry twice that number of peo
ple and then the steamship would not be
crowded. Everything that can possibly
conduce to the comfort of the passengers
has been provided, and the Frisbie is
already a favorite with Vallejo people.
She can make the run in an hour and "a
half, and with wind and tide against her
under the two hours.
The hull of the new steamship was built
at New Whatcom in the yards of the Bel
lingham Bay Improvement Company.
When completed she was loaded with
lumber and towed to San Franoisco. Her
engines and boilers were built and in
stalled by the United Engineering Works
and the Keystone Boiler Works, while
the electric light plant was put In by
Herzog & Dahl. The engines are of the
torpedo boat pattern and 1000 indicated
horsepower.
The handsome new steamship General
Frisbie had her owner's trial yesterday.
She was built for the Vallejo trade, and
was expected to make fifteen knots an
hour. On the run to Vallejo and back
yesterday she averaged* sixteen and one
half knots, and Captain Hatch says that
when the engines are" in perfect working
order she will do better than seventeen
knots.

BOSTON, June 12.â The first of the se
ries of trials of the yacht Independence
was finished to-day, and trie big ninety
footer will not go out again until some
changes have been made to correct a few
slight defects, brought out during the five
days of: sailing. These changes will be a
shortening of the mast, a reduction of the
sailarea due to the tenderness shown by
the boat while on the wind and the sub
stitution of a stern-post rudder for the
balance affair/which has not proved sat
isfactory. The mast will be shortened ten
feet, four feet being taken off the
mainmast and six feet from Â¦ the foot
of the topmast. The reductions in the
sail area will come through the cutting
off of two feet from the top of the main
sail and some slight changes in the head
sails, or a tbtal of some 200 square feet.
This reduction will lighten the top
hamper and stiffen the yacht without ad
ditional ballast.
The Independence sailed to-day for the
first I time under . racing canvas, mainsail,
foresail,- jib,, jib topsail and club topsail,
and in the light breeze seemed to slip
along very fast.
The Independence will go into the navy
yard drydock to-morrow as soon as her
mast has been removed. Â¦>
New Battleship Illinois
Breaks the World's
? Record.
FASTEST CRAFT
OF HER CLASS
BOSTON, June 12.â With the proud dis
tinction of being the fastest battleship in
America and the speediest of her class in
the world, the new sea-fighter Illinois
came to' anchor in President's Roads to
night after a most successful trial. Over
the Governor course, from Cape Ann to
Cape Porpoise and return, a distance of
sixty-six nautical miles, she raced to-day
under the watchful eyes of United States
naval representatives and established a
new record by maintaining an average
speed of 17.31. knots for four consecutive
hours. Not only did she demonstrate
that she was faster than any warship of
her size afloat, but she proved her ability
to turn upon an enemy with extraordinary
quickness by describing a. complete circle
within 300 yards, or little more than twice
her length, in three minutes and ten sec
ond* w,hile plowing through the sea at
full speed.
Steadiness and reserve power character
ized the performance of the ship through
out the entire test. The work of her
engines was smooth and even and the rec
ords of the day showed but one-tenth of a
knot difference in speed between the
northern run and the return run. The
machinery easily met every requirement
and not an accident, of any kind marred
the success of the day." Â¦ 'Â¦ 'f V .
Admirals Are .'Delighted.
*Rear Admiral Sampson, who was on
board unofficially, i and Rear Admiral
Evans, who acted as president of the trial
board, as well as the other naval officers
who participated in the trial, were thor
oughly pleased with the new champion
and as she steamed back to her anchorage
with a broom at her masthead the of
ficials of the Newport News Ship-building
Company, whose three years of labor had
reached such a happy climax, were, en
thusiastically congratulated.
The day could not have been more per
fect for the trial of a battleship. 'Hardly
a breath of air ruffled the -water as the
vessel steamed out of Boston harbor. .
The Illinois was hardly a thing of beauty
as she laid her course for Cape Ann, but
the white wave turned up at her bow gave
those on- board the impression that she
was out for a business-like day's work.
The first mark-boat, the converted yacht
Hist, was in sight just before 10 o'clock,
and twelve- minutes past that hour the
ship crossed the starting line, with her
engines registering , 117 revolutions to" the
minute.
The ship passed mark-boat No. Â«2, the
training- ship -Lancaster, at a 17-knot gait,
22 minutes and 53 seconds after the start.
The next mark, the old Essex, was
picked. up 23 minutes and 20 seconds later,
the Newport in 22 minutes 12 seconds, the
Peoria in 23 minutes 3 seconds, and the
naval tug Potomac at buoy No. 6, Indi
cating the end of the 33-knot run north
ward, in 22 minutes 36 seconds. Â«' -
.Â¦ Â¦ Maintains Even Speed..
For a part of the northward run the
Illinois had reached a speed of 17.84 knots
an hour, and at no time did she drop be
low 16.97. Buoy No. 6 was passed at
12:06:07, showing elapsed time for the run
of 1 hour 45 minutes and 4 seconds, and an
average speed for the 33 knots of 17.36
nautical miles. 'â¢.Â¦'.- Â¦â¢
On the return the elapsed time between
buoys was about the same as during the
first half of the trial. Again she reached
a-maximum speed of 17.84, : with a mini
mum of 16.97.- The finish line was passed
and the speed trial was over at 1:18:33, the
elapsed time being 1:54:42 and the average
speed for the second half 17.26. 7
The completed figures for the entire 66
knots gave 3:48:46 elapsed time and the
average speed 17.31 knots per hour. Tidal
corrections may make slight alterations
in these figures, but the changes are not
likely to affect the . result' materially.

The Republican Primary League of San
Francisco, T. P. Woodward, president, is
rapidly gaining the favor of representa
tive men in the party. Indications point
to enrollment, under the auspices of the
league, of a very large number of Repub
lican voters. The first meeting of the di
rectors at headquarters in the Baldwin.
Annex was held last evening. Ten of the
eleven directors were present. Owing to
sickness in his family Grove P. Ayers
could not attend. The temporary officers
of the organization were declared the per
manent officers. The following standing
committees were createfl by the directors:
Financeâ Grove P. Ayera. David Rich, I. W.
Lees.
Printing and literatureâ J. George Boyne, E.
P. Iiarrett, John W. Rogers.
.Headquarters and rulesâ E. E, Bchmitz,
Janv-s P. Cheetham, L. E. Savage.
Organization and campaignâ A. Ruef. T. P.
Woodward, I. W. Lees. /
The campaign committee will meet at
headquarters every evening to confer with
district representatives. In the confer
ences officers of the leaeue other than
those on the committee will participate.
It was decided last night to appoint dis
trict organizing committees. In each dis
trict there will be a committee of five
lepresentative Republicans, whose duty It
will be to promote affiliation with the
league and awaken public interest in the
coming primary election. Much time was
Blven last evening to a discussion of by
laws. The directors expect to finish the
v.'ork in this respect and present a report
to-night.
The action of the committee in engag
ing five rooms In the Baldwin Annex for
permanent headquarters and paying five
months' rent in advance was approved by
the league. It was decided to wire the
rooms and rut in electric lights.
The league has elected' an advisory com
mittee consisting of seventy-five promi
nent citizens of Republican faith. An
nouncement of such election was not
made until yesterday afternoon, yet forty
acceptances were on file last night. It
was deemed best, however, . to withhold
publication of the names until to-morrow,
so that all acceptances may be registered
before the names are published. The pa
triotic and prompt response of . so many
leading merchants, bankers, manufac
turers and professional men assures the
promoters of the league that the move
ment is bound to be successful. . ,

VT. A. Raybourn and Loretta Strove
were arrested yesterday by^Detectives
"Whittaker and McMahon as they were
about to board the Stockton steamer, and
booked en route to Perry. Oklahoma,
where they are wanted for obtaining
money by false pretenses.
From the dispatches received from the
Sheriff of Perry. Raybourn and Mrs.
Strove planned an elopement, after fraud
ulently obtaining $2000 from a real estate
dealer named Fred Cumby. Raybourn is
married to Mrs. Strove's sister; whom he
deserted to elope with Loretta. Mrs.
Strove is also married, and is the mother
of four children. The couple arrived here
last Tuesday and rented apartments in
an uptown lodging-house, registering as
L. Phebe and wife. As they intended to
leave the city they left their baggage at
the ferry, so that they could ship it at a
moment's notice. The detectives, who
were on the lookout for them, yesterday
learned where the baggage was, and they
concluded to watch it, expecting that the
couple would show ud and claim it.
Shortly after noon Raybourn and Mrs.
Strove appeared at the wharf where the
baggage was stored and ordered it shipped
to Stockton. They had already purchased
tickets for the Slough City and- were
about to board the steamer bound for
there when McMahon and Whlttaker
stepped up and placed the astonished
couple under arrest. They readily ad
mitted their identity, but denied the
charge of having defrauded the Perry real
estate dealer.
The pair will be held pending the arrival
of an officer from Oklahoma.

SCOTT LEARY, the champion ama

a world's record at the Olympic
Club swimming tournament last
evening. He negotiated fifty
yards In the fast time of 29 1-5 seconds
and won the race, amid the plaudits of
the large crowd that occupied seats
around the tank.
Leary's performance was notable for
the reason that he had to pass a number
of fast swimmers who had handicaps
over him. He has been develoi>ed in the
past year by Sid Cavill and is using the
double overhand stroke that won his
teacher many a contest.
A pleasing- feature of the evening's en
tertainment was the presentation of a
diamond pin to Sid Cavill, who has se
cured a leave of absence of six months in
order to recover his health. The token
was the gift of the members.
The contests were extremely interesting
and exciting. There were fancy divingv
blindfolded races, spring-board diving-,
plunging, under-watcr swimming and an
exciting life-saving exhibition by the
members of the organization. Miss Alice
Cavill and her two brothers grave an in

efforts of the trio were warmly

where there is no similar difference in the
wages of unskilled labor. He expressed
the opinion that the cheapness of Chinese

NEWPORT NEWS, Va,; June 12.â
The strike situation at the New
port News, Shipbuilding and Dry
dock Company's yard : Â¦ has
reached a. critical stage. In ad
dition to the striking machinists, - abouÂ±
500 in number, and the 200 skilled men
from the electrical, plumbing \and pipe
fitting departments laid off yesterday, 150
more, chiefly laborers, were laid off to
day. In each case action was due to In
terference by the strike in the progress
of the work of the departments. -Â¦> It is
said that men in other departments will
be laid off as rapidly, as they finish their
work ahead of the machinists and when
they can do no more without the aid of
the machinists. At the present rate the
yard will close down in a week..
The Business Men's Association met to
day and appointed a committee to confer
with the machinists and management of
the yard, to see If some agreement ' could
not be reached.
NEW YORK, " June 12.â The con
vention of the National Metal
Trade3 Association continued its
sessions to-day. The closing
hours of the convention-' are be
ing devoted to the completion of organi
zation and the arrangement of plans to
strengthen the hands of the manufactur
ers in their fight against the striking ma
chinists. The sum of $500,000, raised by
assessment, is to be placed at the disposal
of a strike committee to be used in be
half of the employers. Asked as to the
use of this fund W. J. Chalmers, chair
man of the press committee, said:
. I Buppose we will use It as the strikers do,'
to support their fellows, pay pickets and meet
other general expenses. We used $166,000 in
the Cleveland strike, where we paid some men
a bonus of $4 a day. There are millions more
If they are needed.
We have Just received a telegram from the
Pacific Coast pledging 114 out of 135 firms to
membership. We have delegates from San
Francisco, Seattle and Portland, and the West
is with us and we are gratified to receive their
support. We seek no trouble, but propose to
protect our interests and industries.
We are suffering no loss arising from delay
on contracts which we were filling- at the time
our machinists struck, for all of our contracts
contain a strike clause releasing us from lia
bility.
The convention decided to make no defi
nite declaration as to the length of a day's
work, leaving the question to settlement
locally. After discussing the matter all
the afternoon the following .resolution
was passed:
The declaration of principles makes the ques
tion of hours and wages a local Issue.
Resolved, That this association will support
any regular . member in his endeavor to con
form to said; declaration of principles.
"This is a victory for the declaration of
principles enunciated at Chicago," said
Chairman Chalmers of the press commit
tee. "We have stuck to that declaration
all through, and are now for it still. The
question of hours will be settled locally.!'
After passing the resolution the conven

Court Rules Out the Testimony of
One of Its Strongest Wit
nesses.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., June 12.â Judge
Wofford to-day ruled out the testimony
of one of the strongest witnesses pre
sented so far by the defense In the case
of Lulu Prince-Kennedy, on trial for the
murder of her husband. The defense had
evidently counted much upon being able
to present this testimony, and the court's
order to strike it out was considered a
blow to their side. Mrs. Kennedy was
visibly depressed by the court's action.
The witness was Edward W. Lewis, an
inspector for the Western Railway Asso
ciation Inspection Bureau, and a personal
friend of the dead man. Through him the
defense hoped to prove the theory that
Kennedy had ruined Lulu Prince under
promise of marriage and then refused
either to marry her or to live with her
after the marriage had been forced upon
him. |
The defense theory is that Kennedy
jilted Miss Prince for the Grand Rapids
woman mentioned In the statement. Other
testimony presented to-day by the de
fense â¢ was an attempt to show that
Mrs. Kennedy was temporarily insane. at
the time of the murder.
The defense had not closed when court
adjourned.

MATTERS still remain the same
in* the strike of the iron work
ers. Dispatches from the East
announcing that the National
Metal Trades had decided to
raise a fund of $500,000 was not seriously
considered, for it was thought about the
various labor headquarters that this could
be easily matched by the voluntary offer
ings of workingmen and the per capita re
cently levied. The Iron Trades Council
was in session all day, but President Mc-
Cabe announced during the evening that
no change had occurred. The executive
committee of the San Francisco Labor
Council was also in session, but had no
information of any reversal of conditions.
The Wine Bottlers and Cellarmen last
night initiated ten members. They will
meet regularly at B'nai B'rith Hall. This
union was but recently organized.
The Machine Coopers' Union has elected
the following officers:

the wholesale butchers, but the meeting
was productive of no results. Some dis
satisfaction was expressed at the failure
of the executive committee of the whole
sale butchers to put matters into shape
for definite consideration.. Another meet
ing will be held at B'nai B'rith Hall on
Sunday afternoon.
The delegation from the Journeymen
Butchers' Union that went to Badeu last
night had a most enjoyable time. They
went first to Butchertown and took the
shore road southward. The men in the
abattoirs were induced to unite with their
brethren In this city in the common
cause.
Most of the shops were to some extent
prepared for the anticipated walkout and
had engaged extra men. While delays
were frequent in the large markets, the
â¢smaller shops got along fairly well. In
many instances the men were notified
that if they left after all their demands
had been granted as far as hours and
wages were concerned, their places would
be filled with others. They went out
nevertheless.
More Butchers Will Go Out.
More butchers will go out to-day. While
many men are coming into the city, few
are able to handle the business of. a
large retail shop, Â¦where alertness is re
quired. , Difficulty may also be experi
enced in securing competent slaughterers.
In this event, the slaughter-houses will
be closed down. Estimates as to the
number of men out vary. Definite reports
had not been received at the headquar
ters in the Temple.

MAJOR 0. WOOD
GOES TO JAPAN
yesterday afternoon to discuss strike
matters. A policy was outlined to whlc.h
The attending representatives of the lead
ing suppliers of meat agreed. While none
will speak officially, it is claimed that
those butcher shops that are unionized
will find difficulty in securing; supplies.
In the immediate vicinity of the bay
wholesalers are thoroughly organized
and are gradually drawing into their
compact all the small slaughterers.
A rumor has been current that all ves
5f Is depending on this city for meat sup
plies could not eecure fresh meat. Ar
rangements have been made by which
this Â¦will be averted- No dearth of meat
will be felt on any ship, as the whole
salers announce that they are deter
mined to see that the commerce of the
port is protected, no matter what local
conditions may prevail.
What is known as the Boss Retail
Butchers" Association had a special meet
ing last night at 8 O'Farrell street- It
was claimed iliat they were Invited by
Wholesale Butchers Meet.
The wholesale butchers held a meeting
ALTHOUGH no scarcity of meat
has as yet affected householders,
the fact that more than 1090 jour
neymen butchers left their work
yesterday morning at 10 o'clock
has greatly crippled the food supply of the
city. In some shops the men remained at
work. . These were the places where the
union card was displayed and in those
where the men had agreed to give em
ployers twenty-four hours' notice of In
tended departure.
As the men quit the bosses donned
aprons and took up the work the men had
relinquished. After a fashion customers
were served, but the prompt delivery of
goods was very problematical. As fast
as the men left the -shops they went to the
Turjc-street Temple, where they reported
to the secretary of the Journeymen
Butchers 1 Union. The heads of the or
ganization went to Baden last night to
eettle trade differences.
Xearly every place where meals are
served or meat sold was put to consider
able inconvenience. As soon as possible
pickets were established. Each one bore
a pink ribbon, on which was inscribed
"San Francisco Butchers' Union No. 115,"
with the seal of the union attached.
Strikers Issue a Statement.
Through the press committee of the
striking butchers the following announce
ment is made:
Approximately 1100 meat cutters and slaught
erers <iuit work. A few of our men are still
Â¦working in unfair houses â not many.
All i he union markets, of which there arc
about 2G0. are open, and will be able tu gel
meat desoite the wholesalers.
Only live of our cards have been sent back
thus far, thoujrh there will undoubtedly be a
few more. There are ISO retailers without cards.
This number Includes all the big shops, employ
ing- the most men.
Almost every union man In Butchertown Â¦went
out. and all the slaughter-houses and packing
houses are tied up. If we can keep them tied
up we have the Ftrlke won. By to-morrow all
the union men will be out. save those working
in union shons.
No butchers are coming- from the country. A
few came from Los Angeles and Portland, but
they joined our union. We have had . several
offers of dressed beef and livestock, but are not
In the buyinir business, and have passed the
offers up to the union proprietors. These oilers
car..e from the middle West. Our men are
mostly single, and they all have money. They
are prepared for a long struggle, if necessary:

do is to keep their blood in good condition, and thus "{M^r^y^'^^v

is generally in a mild form. On the other hand, weak, Sift <2g*J$w
emaciated and sickly ones seem to catch every disease |VvS^>#s>
that comes along. This is because their blood is lack-' I A \\V^fi^

up the body. Poisons of every description accumulate, LJy i"'^'' ' j
in the system, because the polluted and sluggish blood <CX$

"My bowels are "perfect, the nervous
trouble has gone. You can realize I ap-
preciate the value of Grape-Xuts Food.
Don't publish my name, but you can give
it in private correspondence and I will
take pleasure in answering the letters."
This is another evidence of the practi-
cal worth of Grape-Nuts Fo<>d in cases
of weak stomach and bad digestion. It
1* the most scientifically made food In ex-
istence and contains absolutely nothing
but selected iÂ»arts of the field "grains so
cooked and prepared as to admit of al-
most immediate digestion and assimila-
tion, carrying with it the elements fur-
nished by the All Wise Creator for re-
building the nervous system, the soft
part of the brain and the polar plexus.
"I tried almost every kind of food, but
finally was put on Grape-Nuts and In a
little while it began to mane its worth
known. I began to sleep better nights,
my strength gradually came back, and I
gained in weight rapidly until a little
while ago I weighed 165 pounds and have
been a well man for months, with never
a touch of the old trouble. . .
A man in Kirksville. Mo., tells how he
got out of trouble by using Grape-Xuts
Food. He says, "My trouble was intense
suffering in the stomach. It was called
eastralgria, but no medicine gave any per-
manent relief. In June of last year I be-
gan to grow much worse in every respect
I was terribly constipateu and the stom-
ach pains were severe. I ran down until
I weighed only 120 pounds. I had to give
up my business, for my nerves were
completely unstrung and I could not sleep
more than two or three hours during the
night, and that only by snatches during a
lull in the pain.
It Is g-ood to know the kind of food
those with weak stomachs and hearts can
get along with, for when a man or wo-
man is a little below par, an easily di-
gested food is the thing thaf goes right
to the spot

NewYork Stock Market/
NEW TORK, June 12.â The stock market fell
Into remi-etagnation during the latter part of
tlie day. and the gains which were estab
lished In the morning were pretty generally
wiped out under. the driblet of Belling orders
which came /upon a market almost bare of
demand. Various points of *>trength made their
appearance during the day. but they lost their
Influence in sustaining prices. The more cheer
ful feeling in London was quite a noticeable
Influence in the open dealings. Rumors have
been very persistent for several days now that
pe&ce Is approaching in South Africa. To ap
preciate the Importance of an adjustment of
the long-drawn-out etruggle there, that is lor
the world of capital, it must be borne in mind
what enormous demands the British Govern
ment makes on accumulated capital for the
conduct of the war as well as the absolute
cutting off of an important portion of the
world's'gold product while the war lasts. The
large disbursements by the Government on war
account, combined with transfers of Russian
dcpoGlts from Paris, is what has given the
London money market its present ease and has
led to some expectation that the governors of
the Bank of England will further reduce the
minimum discount rate at to-morrow's weekly
peselon. A 10 per cent installment, amounting
to $30,000,000. of subscriptions to the -new con
Â«ol. Issue* due next week, and the -demand for
money which will result is a factor against the
reduction in the bank rate. In the local mar
ket the London influence had spent itself. The
most notable features of the market were Mis
souri Pacific and Pennsylvania, which each
rose at" much as 2% at one time. The suppo
sition ie that the Missouri Pacific directors will
meet next Monday and put the stock on a 5
per cent basis. Stocks of a<fillated companies
xhowed some . sympathy, especially the Denver
and Rio Grande stocks. The --"movement in
Pwineylvanla was due to to-day's report of
the* acquisition of the Pennsylvania Steel Com
pany by the railroad company to safeguard its
nteel rail supply. The United States Steel
rail FtockR were rather significantly heavy, but
the stocks of independent companies shot up
)n a striking manner. The movement in Colo
rado Fuel was sensational, the extreme ! rise
reaching 1Â£%, and the jumps between sales
reaching as much aa 2% points. A violent n-

LOCAL MARKETS.
CHICAGO. June 12.â The only thing that
favored .wheat at the opening was the compara
tive firm tone'" of ..the cables. July sold at the
beginning of the session %Â®%c higher at 71%@
71%c. but the improvement diminished under
the better crop conditions and determination on
the part of the pit operators to take profits on
the advance over yesterday's close. Steadily
the price declined to 70>4c. At this point the
short interests began covering and a rally to
70%@"0%c ensued. This upward movement was
Inspired in some degree by the strength In Sep
tember wheat, and July. 'held steady to the
close, -which was %@?4c lower at 70Â»Â£@70%c.
September wheat was fairly active and sold
between 6S%c and 69%c, and closed firm at %@
%c higher at 69%c. " *
Abundant jnoisture and sufficient warmth for
- growing corn, with Indifferent demand for ship
ping, caused corn to rule heavy at a slight de
cline most of the session. July closed %c lower
at 42-%c. . . ... â¢
Trading in oats was moderately active and
narrow. July closed quiet and lower at 27^c. .
Provisions were firm In the early part of the
session on higher prices for hogs and lighter
receipts at the yards. There was fair country
buying on the reactions. July pork closed 7%c
improved, lard a shade lower and ribs 2 Vic

Wall-Street Conditions.
The circular of Henry Clews says:
" 'Whilst the present position of affairs, is
again BUggestlve of bull tendencies, yet if\is
beset with possible complications and surprises
that counsel keeping a sharp outlook and ample
margins.
"It is hardly necessary to note the hopeful
conditions connected with the crop prospects,
the prosperous condition of home trade, the
abundance of our exports and the closing of
war conditions in the PTflltpplnes. The present
range of prices much more than discounts any
thing warranted by conditions of that char
acter. The all-controlling factor is the ex
traordinary railroad situation and especially
the nececsity arising therefrom for the pro
curement of large masses of stock for a spectal
and transient purpose. Therein lies the force
and direction of the market. It has created
a set of momentary conditions extraordinarily
conducive to speculations and has already pro
duced an elevation of prices far above the nor
mal or what can bs expected to prove per
n.anent. Yet, as matters now stand, it is
quite possible that values may rise 6till higher
and may retain the artificial advance for some
irjoderate time to come. Three p*r cent return
upon couimon stocks of railroads cannot be
counted upon as satisfactory for a perma-
THÂ»ncy, and investors may be expected "to turn
their attention later on to more remunerative
investments.
"The present market affords great facilities
fcr getting long of stocks, as tho6e who now
hold them have them for sale, but those who
buy at the present range of nrices I advise
to get out with great celerity on-the rallies."

Word was received In the Southern Pa
cific building yesterday that President
Hays, who left here Monday evening on
a tour of Inspection, will go East to
Omaha and there confer with President
Bert cf the Union Pacific.
Hays is accompanied on his trip by
General Manager Kruttschnltt. but the
latter will go no further than Ogden, and
will then return to this city.
The object of Hays' journey East to
meet Bert is only a conjecture, but those
who are on the inside claim that the two
presidents will talk over the railroad situ
ation in connection .with the new road
that Senator Clark is building between
Los Angeles and Salt Lake.
From Omaha Hays will go direct to
New York and report to Harriman.

. Family disturbances, culminating in the
departure of his wife and adopted daugh
ter from his home, led Almon "\Veymouth,
a pioneer contractor and mill man of
Livermore, to commit suicide at his resi
dence in that city this afternoon by shoot
ing himself in the head with a pistol while
lying on a.sofa in^the sitting-room. -._. -., Â¦_
The despondent Husband had;, put: - the <
muzzle of the weapon' in his mouth and
sent a 1 bullet crashing throughfhls brain.
His son, William, found the body shortly
after 2 o'clock, having gone to i the house
to see what detained his father from work
at the planing mill. * ' : 1."
The cause of the deed was laid bare in
a number -of letters that were found in
the house. One was addressed to Wey
mouth by his wife,' who wrote that che
had decided to leave him and that their
adopted daughter, Lulu, 17 years'bf age,,
would go with her. A postscript had
been written by the girl. In which she ex
pressed her sorrow at leaving her foster
father, but she felt compelled to depart
with her mother. The girl's action is sup
posed to have contributed mucn to the old
man's despondency, because he had a
strong affection for her. â¢ . â¢
Another note, written by Weymouth, ex
plained that he 'contemplated taking his
own life because of the desertion by hl3
wife and daughter. There were no specific
reasons given, concerning the .disagree
ments in the family, but it is understood
that relations between the various mem
bers had Â¦ been ' strained for a long time.
Mrs. Weymouth married Weymouth eight
years ago, being his second wife.^ His
children by a former marriage, a son and
a daughter, did not reside at the home
place and the townspeople have under
stood that they did not get along well
with their stepmother. r
Mrs. Weymouth and the girl left Liver
more on the morning train, saying they
intended to come to friends in Oakland.
That move settled Weymouth's determi
nation to end his existence, although he
had been thinking of suicide for several
days. Last week he tried to purchase
cartridges to fit a bulldog pistol, but
could not obtajn the size he needed. This
noon he bought a pistol and cartridges at
Dutcher's hardware shop and then went
to > his mill; where, he. attended to. some
business. â¢ .,...- ... Â¦Â» * ..." .
â¢Then the old man drove over to his resi
dence and made preparations to die.
*The dead pioneer was a native of Maine,
about 70 years of age. He settled in
Livermore Valley more than forty years
ago. He leaves one brother, who is a
rancher in the valley, and , another
brother, Albert Weymouth, manager for
the- Berkeley Lumber The
Coroner took charge of the case.

Commander B. F. Tilley, U. S. N., Gov

take a ride in a hack. He left the hotel
about 6 p. m. with the strangers, accord
ing to his story and was found six hours
later wanderings around Gray Bros.* quar
ry near the seawall.
Commander .Tilley was found at mid
night by. Arthur Flaherty and Howard
Lennox, residents of .the neighborhood,
who were attracted by the naval officer's
strange movements. Â¦ . Â¦ *
When interrogated by the police the
commander told of his . experience with
the daring, thugs. He said the men drove
him about the city, for some time, stop

some streets. about 10 p. m. .
Then they dragged him out of the. hack,
threw him to the ground and forcibly re
lieved him'of his watch and coin.

brought to the hotel, as if he had been

KIDNAPING
OF GOVERNOR
OF SAMOA
The men were called out because they could
not handle the meat being supplied from non
union slaughter- houses. The proprietors of a
majority ot the shops axe In sympathy with
Us, however, and Instead of trying to get non
union labor in place of the union men who
walked out they are running the shops as best
they can. They have signed our agreement,
and they having done so we cannot- take the
cards away from them. Just as soon as any
attempt la mad* to secure non-union men.
however, we consider the proprietors have
broken faith and the card is withdrawn. This
stand was taken on the advice of Grand Or
ganizer Pierce, who was to conference with us
yesterday. ,
Fred Becker is trying to get men from
outside the city, but the union- represen
tatives declare he has not been success
ful. â¢ . '
"From the wholesalers' standpoint we
I feel satisfied with the situation." said
Irving C. Lewis of Grayson. Owen & Co.
[ "We expect a speedy termination of the
I strike, in view of the stand taken by the
San Francisco wholesalers."
The local\ union of the Amalgamated
Meat Cutters and -Butcher "Workmen will
hold an all-day meeting to-morrow, com
mencing at 9:30 o'clock a. m., when every
aspect of the strike will be canvassed in
detail. . Iv.'
The union reports show that James
Pitts, George Loher and M. Schlck, em
ploying butchers, have accepted the union
card. "
The press committee of the union has
issued the folio wins statement:
Every non-union shop, wholesale and
retail, has been picketed by union dele
gates. . . . â¢
The day's developments were without
significance so far as the general situa
tion goes. The wholesalers are exerting
every effort in their power to furnish beef
to the retailers who have pulled down the
union cards. To this end members of the
firms who have not slaughtered for years
are head and shoulders deep In work at
the stockyards. A few union men have
returned to work and have abandoned the
organization, but they number not a doz
en. Non-union help is being utilized wher
ever obtainable, but so far the butchers,
both wholesale and retail, have had much
difficulty in securing skilled workmen.
The union, as well as the wholesalers,
have transferred their attention In large
measure to the San Francisco side of the
bay. The strike there is of such large
proportion and the Interests so much
greater that what is accomplished by
either side Is Immediately reflected upon
the Oakland situation. The wholesalers
here are particularly watchful of the de
velopments across the bay. for. they take
their cue for the most part from the big
firms on the other side. ,

Jule Perkins testified that he got down
on his hands and knees behind some rocks
and watched the shooting. His testimony
v.-as nearly the same as that of Watson.
Justice Masten decided that Thomas Wat
son was the aggressor and ordered the
prisoner released.
Frank Watson testified that he and
Jule Perkins went back and tried to per-
Fuade Thomas Watson to return. They
all kept under cover as they walked to the
mine, so they were not seen by Wlzen
lÂ«?rsrer. When they came into sight Frank
Watson carried the gun. The old man
took the gun from Frank, handed him
h'.s cane and said. "Ben. get your gun."
Wizenberger did not hear the first call and
it -was repeated. Then M"izenberger looked
up and ran for his gun at the lower end
<f the sluice. Wizenberger appeared be
hind a bank with his gun. only his head
and shoulders showing. He fired a shot
and eld man YURtson fired. V/lzenberger
fired again aihd^ killed the old man.
Wizenberger rai for home. Frank Wat
pon picked up his father's rifle and fired
ttvo shots.
After dinner George took the shotgun
and went off to work with Frank Watson.
<jeorge Watson gave as the reason for
taking the shotgun a desire to prevent
Ills father from getting- the gun. In a
short time Jule Perkins came and told
him his father was going up the road with
a rifle. Frank Watson and Jule Perkins
left to persuade the old man to come
back. Soon they heard shots. George
told the men who were working with him
that there was trouble on. When he ran
10 the mine across lots he found his
father dead.
SUSANVILLE, June 12.â Benedick Wiz
enberger was released to-day after the
preliminary examination. George Wat
son, Frank Watson and Jule Perkins were
called by the prosecution and the defense
offered no testimony.
George Watson was the first witness.
He testified that We went to the mine and
had a quarrel with Benedick Wizenberger.
They both started for a, gun, but Wat
son got there first and took the two shells
out of Benedick Wizenberger's gun. Then
he put the gun back in its place and left.
When he went home he met his father
and told him. about taking the shells out
of the weapon. They then walked to the
house and ate their dinner.

ST. PAUL. June 12.â Election of officers
and a protracted contest over the admis
sion of cities of over 200,000 Inhabitants to
the jurisdiction- of the order filled the
business day of the Modern Woodmen of
America to-day. The proposition to take
city members Into the order came up on
the report of the law committee. An
amendment was proposed to this report to
dispense with the present limit, which
keeps cities of over 200,000 from joining the
qrder, Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee. Buf
falo, Detroit, Cleveland, San Francisco,
Cincinnati, Philadelphia and Pittsburg be
ing named in several motions and . being
then taken up one at a time and voted on.
On Chicago the vote was 260 to 32S. and the
others were more quickly disposed of. all
being voted down. This leaves paragraph
4 of the raw committee's report with tn +
single recommendation that Utah be ad
mitted to the jurisdiction of the order and
this amendment will doubtless be carried
on Friday. The action this afternoon in
considered as settling for some years to
come the membership limitations of tha
Modern -Woodmen.
The first business to-day was the elec
tion of officers. Head Consul "W. A. North
cott of Illinois, Head Clerk C. W. Hawes
of Illinois and Head Adviser Dan B. Herd
of Iowa, were re-elected. R. R. Smith of
Brookfleld. Mo., was elected head banker.
Physicians were elected for each state and
the following were nominated for direct
ors, five vacancies having to be filled: Ben
jamin D.. Smith of Mankato, Minn.; J. N.
Reece of Springfield, 111.; E. E. Murphy cf
Leavenworth, Kans.; G. "W. Reilly of
Danville, -111.; C. G. Saunders of Council
Bluffs. Iowa, and T. F. Hopkins of Rock
ford, 111. .. -
After the election of Head Consul Nbrth
cott, who has served rive terms succes
sively, that official announced that he
would not again be a candidate for the
position but would retire at thÂ© end cf
the new term.
The ballot for directors, 620 delegates
voting, resulted: Hapkins. 270; Reilly. 506;
Murphy, 580; Talbot. 509; Smith, 590; Saun
ders, 564.
At the afternoon session the election of
officers was completed by the election of
the following: Head chaplain. Rev. James
I. Churm/Waupun, "Wia.; head escort. C.
D. Eliott, Washington; head watchman.
H. M. Smith, Richland, Mo.; head sentry,
A. E. Bates, Minnesota. -

twice than do it right in the first place.

The above correction is published as
news and not at the expense of the board
of directors of "the University Mound Old
Ladies' Home.
Without questioning the sincerity of the
members of the board of directors of the
University Mound Old Ladies' Home and
with keen appreciation of the worthi
ness of this charity. The Call still finds its
duty to be the publication of facts that
have come to its knoweldge which have
most vitalbearing upon the welfare of all
organized charities, of this city and its
suburbs! The "correction" Involving un
qualified indorsement of Mrs. K. C. Greg
ory, compels this paper in Justification of
its course to publish in 'further detail In
formation "in its possession as to her
methods of serving sweet charity.
Business men of San Francisco and
those charitable women who contribute
freely to the success of all efforts to raise
money for worthy charities do so with a
whole-souled liberality worthy of generous
California. In the past they have been
able to do so with a reasonable assurance
that of every dollar contributed a hundred
cents would go to relieve the suffering or
Increase the happiness of the unfortunates
who were the beneficiaries of the charity.
These people will not care to see trans
planted to this^commu-nity the pernicious
system known as "listing the town," by
which a portion, even the major part, of
money contributed may' be diverted to
the pocket of some enterprising individual,
who, without personal interest in the
charity, Is willing tc. undertake ' the un
pleasant task of management of fair or
benefit entertainment for the sake of the
profit to be made out of it. >
The Call is preoared - to prove that the
seven young women who have been selling
f:kets under the direction of Mrs. Greg
ory for the entertainment referred to in
the above "correction" are not volunteers,
but were employed by Mrs. Gregory on a
weekly wage and percentage of receipts
for all above a stipulated amount. .
An advertisement â¢ was ! inserted in the
papers, Mrs. Gregory having left the
Grand Hotel and registered at the Cali
forir.a Hotel, under the name of "Miss C.
C. Graham" for that purpose. The adver
tisements appeared Sunday -morning, and
a score or more of young women applied
In response to them. The proprietors of
the California Hotel became suspicious of
their guest when so many young women
began to. swarm Into the corridors, and
"Miss Graham" was requested to leave.
Needless to say she complied with the re
quest.
It is to be regretted that the directors
of the University Mound Old Ladles'
Home enlisted the services of a woman
who found It desirable to register under
an assumed name for purposes which
aroused suspicion, and caused her expul
sion from - a : hotel. .The home is . worthy
of aid and needs aid, and its future should
not be imperiled by. the employment ! of
such methods.
The advertisement appeared in the Call
of Sunday morning aa follows: â¢
For Thursday morning:, . June 13, 1901.

ment . published yesterday morninj? in

to. be eiven at Native Sons" Hall on
June 28. ...
No advertisement for young ladies to
assist in the work of selling tickets for
this work was Inserted from th.e Cali
fornia Hotel or elsewhere. ' The four
young ladies, (not nine) who are helping
to raise this fund axe well and favor- â¢
ably known in San Francisco. They
volunteered their services and feel that
an injustice has been done them.
The members of the board, knowing
that Mrs. Gregory had the ability to
carry to a successful issue the affair
now under way, enlisted her , services, i
but it seems that a mistaken impres
sion was gathered from the interview
with one of the officers of the board as\
to the exact nature of her connection,
with ' it. Mrs. Gregory cam*" to San
Francisco three years ago and has been
interested in charitable work at Inter
vals ever since.

The two Abrams, whose arrest has
caused all. the excitement, have been
turned over, to the Federal authorities,
and to-morrow they will be examined
before the Federal Grand Jury. Other ar
rests may. follow, but there will be found
nothing more than a multiplication of
the petty thieving that goes on wherever
troops are located.
The military investigation Is in the
hands of Lieutenant Colonel Marlon P.
Maus, inspector i general on the staff of
General Shatter. ,'
"The military authorities have now
nothing. to do with the- affair, other than
the seizure of Government goods found
in the possession of civilians, the posses
sion of which cannot be satisfactorily ac
counted for. The detection and. prosecu
tion of these dealers rests with the civil
and Federal authorities, and I hope they
make a success of it. " â¢ '..Â¦Â¦'->
"In my opinion the police and Federal
authorities are. exposing a system of pet
ty-thieving. Owing to the large number
of men these petty dealers have had op
portunity to deal with their thievery has
grown to larger proportions than.it other
wise would have.
"Notwithstanding the fact_that those
having Government ' property wrongfully
in their possession can be prosecuted on
a charge of felony, and given a sentence
of fro.m' one to five years* confinement,
there, are. plenty of men .willing to take
the chance. The goods are first-class and
can be purchased ' from the soldiers at a
ridiculously low figure. I
"The soldier cannot be prevented from
selling the stuff. . In disposing of 'it. he
leaves himself short.. The officer who is
sues to the men inquires as to the quan
tity of goods ho . has in his possession.
If the officer thinks he is amply supplied
he refuses to issue the goods the soldier
asks for. In this manner the enlisted
man is prevented from drawing more
than he needs. ' Â¦. Â¦ '-
stores "will be unearthed X>y the investiga
tion now belng'made by .Â¦the'Federal aUr
thorities. There is a strictly enforced rule
providing for the taking of stock at the
end of each month by officers held re
sponsible for stores under their, charge.
2 "I do know, " however, what a soldier
will do for a little ready money, and'I am
of the opinion that the goods found by the
police are purchased' from the soldiers
passing In and out of this post. More
than 60,000 men have passed through this
post during the war. If one man in every
ten of these soldiers sold to dealers a pair
of shoes; 600 pairs would thus be piaced
in the hands of outsiders. The same rule
applies to shirts and blankets. '

mento" street he found twelve pairs of; tan
shoes and In a store at 621 Sacra

was all that the detective could find in the
market. .
THE arrest of Lipman Abrams and
his son. George Abrams. of 1403
Powell street, Tuesday night,
marks the ' beginning Of an at
tempt on the part of the military
authorities to make the man who buys
Government "clothing from the soldier as
culpable as the soldier who sells, ahd in
that way reduce the traffic in quarter
master's stores that is going . on contin
ually. . . --
The arrest of the two men Is not the be
ginning of a great scandal, nor will gi
carrtic frauds be unearthed, nor will there
be any one beyondfa few private soldiers
and obscure merchants involved in the
trouble. The quartermaster's stores on
the . market have been secured from sol
diers who sold them in violation of the
articles of war, and it is a traffic that is
going on always at every military
poet In the - country. In the last few
months 60.000 soldiers have passed through
this port and the selling of goods by even
a very small percentage of that number
would Â«tock the market with as much
Government stuff as has ever been found
'a soldier who sells Jiis clothing is se
verely dealt with, but the military author
ities have decided to make the buyer suf
fer as much, and so the aid of the police
was called in to run down persons carry
ing on this illegal traffic and to locate all
the stolen goods possible. Detective Har-
ry Reynolds was given the task and he
has been searching for Government stuff
for several days.
At the store of Jacob Steveler. 502 Pa

In Havana during the war the ration of
flour to each .man was one pound and a.
quarter. Â¦ The ration ' of bread . was . tlÂ»c
same. Any .baker knows that a pound of
flour will make more than a pound of
bread, and the bakers of Havana wanted
flour and the soldiers 'did not Â¦ want 1 the
trouble of. cooking bread. / It was so ar
ranged that the men drew their flour and
gave it to the bakers and the bakers fur
nished them with bread,, pound for.pound
and made the difference out of. the saving
In flour: The . market of Havana - was
flooded with Government flour and every
one knew it, a*d the traffic* was stopped
only because supplies â¢ came' in â¢ In - such;
quantities that there, was not storage
room for them all and petty thieving was
rife. The only way it could be stopped
â¢was . to keep Government supplies abso
lutely out of the market and then the man
who carried any found, trouble. .,.- J
' It is not necessary to' cancel the marks
on the cases of goods traded off by the

trading be done under the eye of an offi

profitable deal, but the -men get a phauge
