REDLAXDS, May S.â Dusty and'
dirty and panting like a tired
horse, tho big engine hauling
the President's train reached
the top of the grade through
the San Bernardino range
this morning after a long run through the
rif.scrt. Since leaving the grassy plains
of Texas there had been nothing but the
hcFpitality of a few towns to break the
monotony of sand, cactus plants and the
f-trugg-lir.g weeds of the dreary waste
Fttetching through Arizona and the 'first
few miles into the State of California.
But as the train, gathering headway.
Fjjun down the pass, the landscape of bare
h;iis and chaparraT* unfolded into the
choicest verdure under the southern sun
ar.cl the cars stopped at Redlands in a
bower of flowers.
It was well Redlands was chosen as the
Â¦welcoming place for the President; for no
Rrcster inspiration could lend its aid to an
orator and no urettier ecene rest the eye
of the wearv and travel-stained. "
The tcyn was gay as a summer bride in
her finest dressing of flags and banners,
her most fragrant blossoms and her best
of &mfles. It was a glorious day and not
one thing happened to mar the welcome
awaiting the President.
Prompt as a watch, the cars pulled into
1 he Redlands station. They were hauled
by a big extra engine that had been
hitched to the rear end of the train to
bring it up the grade to the town. The
oTjg-ine had been transformed from-a thing
of iron and steel into a mass of brilliant
flowers and the decorations went even to
the cap of the engineer, which was ag
pr^sEively patriotic in the three beloved
colors. When the train stopped the engine
was unhitched and drew away, leaving
the crowd on tiptoe of excitement, and

"Governor Gage, ladies and .gentle

with emotions of "pleasure, and 'of
gratitude California's greeting, voiced
by the chief executive of your great.
commonwealth on behalf of. the peqple
to the chief executive of.'the Govern
ment of the United States. It Is your
tribute to the . great onice which for
the hour I am permitted to "hold, rep

and it-Is your expression of love for
the Union, for our great civil institu
tions, and your affection* for the-con

"California had some trouble in get-,
ting Into the Union in the early days.
The most 1 Berious question in the"his
tory of the republic,- that of 'Â¦ human
slavery, deterred for a little while your
full connection with the Union of , the
States, but it came; it . came because
the â¢ earnest, energetic, enterprising,
patriotic Americans living on" this"
coast demanded the. right. to share not

adjustment of the -very many compli

of the State of California, Mr. Presi
dent, I have the high honor, of sin- â
cerely welcoming you, and you also,
our other illustrious guests, to this
State." (Cheers and applause.)
McKinley stepped forward, bowing
and smiling, but he wisely refrained from
words until the tumult that greeted him
had subsided. He stood at the corner of
the porch looking out over the people,
over the house and waving flags of the
town, over the glistening green of the
orange groves, on for miles to where the
rising haze â¢ blurred the outlines of the
distant hills, for the faraway range was
all that limited his view. The. Jatfel is on
a gentle slope that rises from^Hie. town,
and as the President stood upon its porch
he looked out over the valley In which
Redlands lies like a Jewel in . Its setting,
and one of the fairest sights of Southern
California. . â¢ -. '.-

out effort and not loud, but his voice. car-*

"Mr. President and Ladies and Gen
tlemen: I have the high honor, as
well as the great pleasure, on behalf
of the people of the State of Califor
nia, to most sincerely welcome you to
our State. This heartfelt greeting ex
tended by the people of the State of
California on this occasion is accom
panied by a public pride, in part arts- .
ing from the consciousness that, not
withstanding the great dividing moun
tains and broad rivers and lines de
noting many different statehoods, and
that thousands of miles separate us
from thÂ« .national capital, still- dis
tance from the official center has
neither checked the loyalty nor cooled
the patriotism of CallfornlansL And
the people of this State bear witness
here to-day that California is an in- Â¦
separable part ef the great nation
whose patriotic spirit centers at Wash
ington and radiates and reflects the
unabated love and loyalty of a happy <
and contented people for the Ameri
can flag and for the grand constitution
of this republic Grateful for the
blessings or equal rights guaranteed
under the constitution and glorying
in the great history of our country,
Â¦which the grand national administra
tion has both extended and enlarged
and honored, the people of -the State
of California express, in unison with
their fellow citizens of other States,
their sincere appreciation of the deeds
and of the words of those, who preside
In our nation's council.
The firet words were spoken by Mayor
Fowler of Redlands and his was only an
Introductory sentence that told how
pleased Redlands was at the honor that
had come to her; then he Introduced Gov
ernor Gage who formally,- welcomed the
President a'nd his party; to California.
The Governor said: \
Formal "Welcome Extended.
The greeting in the lobby was purely

could have pleased me more than to receive
from your eminence, surrounded by this crowd
of bishops and Illustrious personages, the In
signia of this honor and high dignity. It je-
Jolces me to receive these signs .of pontifical
favor In this metropolitan See, in which the
example of your apostolic zeal and pastoral
care have been so bright and have done so
much fcr the promotion of Catholic Interests
as well as for the furtherance of all things
â¢which aid in the progress of humanity and the
clory of the nation. But you will permit mÂ«
to add another reason for my happiness." I
find It In your continuous and untirins kind
ness toward me from the moment in which,
by the command of the supreme pontiff, I was
placed at the head of the apostolic delegation.
Theee and other considerations awaken in me
a spirit of rratltude toward your eminence. I
ber you then to accept the thanks which I cor
dially offer you, and not only to you. but to
the Illustrious prelates and others who have
come to honor this occasion by their presence
do I offer the expressions of my sincere grati
tude. Meanwhile, most eminent Fir, I pray the
great and good God long to preserve and bless
you.
Regly of His Eminence.
Cardinal Gibbons descended from his

bearing the berretta. Mgr. Martinfelli

whom he knelt and bowed his head. Slow
ly lifting the berretta from .the silver
salver upon which it rested Cardinal Gib
bons unfolded it and held it high in order
that the congregation might see It. Then,
stooping and with what seemed to be a
softly murmured prayer, he olaced it
upon the head of the Cardinal-elect, who
arose and, advancing to the front of the
altar, spoke as follows:
or clergy, or people more loyal and more de
voted to the sovereign pontiff, more tenacious
of "the faith once delivered to , the saints,"
more zealous In extending the kingdom of
Christ than the bishops and priests and laity
of the United States. Be assured, roost emi
nent father, that our prayers and best wishes
will follow you. May you enjoy In the eternal
city that peace an dtranqulliity which Is the
fruit of a mission faithfully accomplished.
There Is but one sad note In the Joyous fes
tivity of to-day, and that Is found In the re
flection that your eminence is destined to leave
u*. But we Indulge the hope that you will
abide with us for some time yet. And we are
cheered and comforted by the consideration.
that when you take up your residence in Rome
the holy father will have In you a wise and
produent counsellor, who is conversant with
the religious, moral and social conditions of
the United States. Your eminence will be able
to Inform his holiness that in no country in
the Christian world can be found a hierarchy.
The spirit of yovr administration has been
fittingly characterized in the words of the
Royal Prophet. "Mercy and truth have met
each other. Justice and peace have kissed."
You have followed the Injunction of the apos
tle of the Gentiles, which Is also the sentiment
of your own Illustrious founder: "Omnla ves
tra In charltatate flant." ("Let all your works
be done in charity.") By your justice you have
settled disputes. By your charity you have
healed the wounds which are sometimes In
flicted by litleation.
Kind and Just Policy.
Less than live years aeo you came amonr
us an entire stranger. You will leave us
bound by the hallowed ties of friendship with
out a single enemy to sound a discordant note
In the universal jubilee of praise and con
gratulation. Your mission to the United
States fcas been a mission of peace. While
livlnK among us you have taken as your
model the Prince of Peace himself, of whom It
is written, "He shall not contend nor cry out.
neither shall His voice be heard in the streets.
The bruised reed He shall not break, the
smoking flax He shall not extinguish." Tou
have fulfilled your onorous duties most ef
fectually, without noise or ostentation. In dis
charging your missloin as apostolic delegate
your emlnenece has been actuated by a high
sense of Justice, by a Justice tempered with
charity.
Most Eminent Father: I bee leave to tender
to your emlnenece my most sincere congratu
lations on the well-merited honor which the
holy father has conferred on you In associat
ing you with the members of the Sacred Col
lege. And I am sure that in offering my fe
licitations I am expressing not only the senti
ments of my heart, but those also of all my
venerable colleagues of the American episco
pate who are so numerously represented on
this joyous occasion. They have come from
the north and south, from the east and west,
and many of them from a considerable dis
tance and with great Inconvenience to thsm
seleves. as this is the season of the year when
they are usually 'engaged in administering
confirmation and in makinz the visitation of
their dioceses. I am certain also that the
Eood wishes of the prelates are shared by the
clersy throughout the United States.
Mgr. Marchetti. upon the conclusion
of the reading of the briefs, advanced to
Cardinal Gibbons' throne and delivered to
him an address informing him that the
Supreme Pontiff had committed to him
the office of investing with the red ber
retta Cardinal Martinelli. of whom Mgr.
Marchetti said: "His obedience overcame
his humility and brought him unwilling
to this sublime dlgmity, of which I will
say nothing at present, as another more
worthy than 1 will more clearly and more
gracefully speak of it."

BALTIMORE. May 8.â Sebastian Mar
tinelll. titular Archbishop of Ephesus and
Cardinal-elect cf the Church of Rome, to
day received at the hands of Cardinal
Gibbons the red berretta.and donned the
lobes which will hereafter mark his rank.
The ceremony, which is the second step
In hJs elevation to his new position, was
marked by all the pomp and brilliance
usually attendant upon such occasions. It
was held in the venerable cathedral, the
first edifice of Its kind erected upon
American sell and In which the first
American priest and the first American
Jiishop were ordained. Among those who
witnessed It were men and women prom
inent in every walk of life, diplomats, leg
islators, educators. Journalists and ec
cleslasts, the latter including half a score
cf Archbishops, half a hundred Bishops,
jirlests, monks and seminarians.
The initial Ptep in the ceremony took
place In the palace of the Cardinal and
consisted of the transmission of the ber
letta to Cardinal Gibbons by. Mgr. Mar
chettf. the papal ublegate. . Brief ad
dresses were made by ooth the partici
pants in this affair. While this was in
jirogress a procession was formed In front
of Calveit Hail, a block away, in which
were arranged in the order named the
seminarians, priests, Franciscan and
Augrustinian monks, the members of the
faculty In the Catholic University in
"Washington, abbots. Bishops and finally
the Archbishops, the purple and gold of
their rich vestments adding brilliancy to
the scene. . ''Â¦ Â¦
At 10 o'clock they moved through Cathe
dral to Chivies street, passing trie palace
of the Cardinal, where they were joined
by his Eminence, clad in full official para
phernalia, who took his place last in the
line. Thence the procession moved to the
littilu entrance <>5 the cathedral. The Car
dlnal-tlect meanwhile had entered the
building through a rear door and ad
vauee<i to meet the procession at the altar
rail. The Cardinal and the Cardinal-elect
saluted each other profoundly and each
souyht the thr<n;e provided for him. That
for Cardinal Gibbons occupied the gospel
side of the altar, while that of the Car
dinal-elect was placed upon the epistle
side. When they had seated themselves
the papal brief to Cardinal Gibbons was
read, as follows:

Western Classification
Committee Begins
Session. <
Classification Committee began its regu
lar semi-annual meeting at this place to
day, most of the members having. come
from Chicago and other Western polnt3
in a special train via Southern California.
There are about sixty-five traffic officials
present, representing most of the promi-.
nent railroads west of Chicago. The
membership of the committee comprises
eighty roads, but several of them have
no i sent representatives to this meeting.
It was the delay in the arrival of .the spe
cial tram that postponed the opening of
the meeting from, yesterday to to-day,
and those members who arrived by regu
lar train yesterday were enabled to do a
large amount of sightseeing hereabouts
while waiting for their colleagues.
Much of the ' preliminary work was ac
complished by. the party on the special
en. route to i>el Monte, for u number of
these aboard were members of a sub
committee appointed. at the last meeting
of the general committee to go over the
docket wlth< a view, to arranging the busi
ness to come up in as condensed a form
aa possible.' A report of this work was
the chief business of the opening session,
and,- although many questions were
brought up for consideration, no final ac
tion was taken upon any. of them. .
The committee convened at 11 o'clock
and . held a brief opening session, and at
2 p. 'm. began regular business. A propo
sition to advance the ratings on smoking
tobacco from the second to the first class
was considered. Messrs. Keane and Wy
man, | representing the American Tobacco
Company, addressed the committee in op
position to the proposed advance. Repre
sentatives of other factories also ad
dressed the committee in opposition, and
much of the afternoon was occupied in
this wa: r .
The present meeting is considered by its
members to be of rather . minor impor
tance, for the matters coming before it
are of local rather than general signifi
cance and business will therefore occupy
a comparatively small part of the stay
here. The committee has nothing to do
with the fixing of freight rates, Its busi
ness ' being the classification of articles
according to their quality and other
points. Probably the most Important
matter likely to occupy the attention of
the committee Is a proposition to modify
the schedule governing ratings on mixed
carloads. â¢ Another important matter is
the application of the Davenport, Rock
Island and Northwestern Railroad for
membership in the committee.

Cincinnati, testified before the Industrial
Commission to-day concerning railroad
freight rates from the Ohio River south
ward. He said that Cincinnati and other
.Western, cities had suffered Blnce 1879 from
discrimination on the part of the railroads
In the carrying of merchandise and manu
factured articles in the Interest of the
Eastern seaboard. The case/had, he said,
been presented to the Interstate Com
merce Commission, but while the commis
sion had recognized the injustice of It and
had secured an order for the discontinu
ance of its practice, no attention had been
paid to it.
Wilson said that the discrimination
against Ohio River points is the result
of an agreement which was entered into
almost a qOarter - of . a. cenutry ago be
tween the Atlantic coast roads running
south and the roads running north' of the
river. In accordance with that agreement
the Ohio River roads had advanced the
price ; of manufactured articles and had
kept them, so , high as to practically ex
clude the I manufactured articles of the
West from the market, notwithstanding
the manufacturing center In that time had
moved rapidly west. So great had this
preference been that many Western' man
ufacturers bad found It profitable to es
tablish warehouses in Atlantic seaboard
cities for the distribution of their wares
through the South rather than to- attempt
to get them Into that terrlory through the
natural channels, which were the Western
roads running southward. Often the rates,
he said, from Cincinnati to" Southern
points were greater than from New. York,
notwithstanding the distance Is only about
half bo ereat. â¢ * â¢ :
The commission listened to a statement
from C. D. Griffith of the Denver Chamber
of Commerce, who read a document pre
pared by the Chamber . complaining of
freight rate discrimination against .the
city on the part of the railroad companies.
It was reported that this practice grows.
largely out of the fact that the Missouri
River is made the base of Western rates.
The opinion was expressed that this base
should be moved westward to the longi
tude i of Denver. The Chamber of Com
merce also made complaint of instability
of railroad rates and a, plea was made for
uniform and stable charges. Griffith said
that'the rate from New York And Chicago
to Denver is about the same as the rate
from' those citles-to San Â¦ Francisco und
that the rate from Denver toSan Fran
cisco Is no ! lower than that from New.
York and Chicago to San Francisco. He
also said that, notwithstanding the fact
that' Denver Is 600 miles nearer Idaho and
Montana than Missouri River points, Den
ver's freight rate to those States la only
one-fifth less. . Also it was true that goods
could Â¦'. be shipped . to Â¦ San Francisco and
back. to Utah at a lower freightage than
the same goods could be shipped. to Den
ver and then shipped, to Utah. .

An outsider boosted the price to $500, cre

McMahon, told an intimate friend he saw
no chance to beat Twinkler.

Track Notes.
. Blacksmith Frank O'Rourke's Burns
handicap winner The Fretter, tired of do-
Ing duty in the signal corps and taking
his place on the "firing line" again at
Oakland yesterday, captured the May
handicap after a snappy brush with Ada
JC. The showing of the chestnut horse In
his two previous engagements would in
dicate that he was suffering from a se
vere case of indisposition. For that rea
son and because of having drawn the
capital prize. 117 pounds, the books laid 4Vi
to 1 about him, the opening 5 to 2 finding
few takers. Rio Shannon, which also
opened up at 5 to 2, receded to 7 to 2, be
cause. It was said, there was "nothing
doing." This was undoubtedly one of the
many rumors that grain credence, though
Russell did bungle things badly. For a
time it looked during the early part of the
race as if Ada N. with little Webster on
her back, would get heme iirst. But when
Ruiz got ready with The Fretter that
horse had too much left, beating the
three-year-old filly out a half-length and
stepping the mile and an eighth in 1:53^2.
Malay was third. â¢
For a change, first choices took more of
a hand in proceedings. Searchlight, Va
s-allo, MacGyle and Glendenning landing
first, all well backed. The delightful
weather attracted a large crowd and the'
track was in perfect condition.
A "stranger" that was highly touted
started in the first event, a six-furlong
rur. for maidens. It was reported that
Searchlight had worked six furlongs in
1:14%, and from 4 the odds were soon cut
to IVi. making the newcomer equal favor
ite with Sailor. Away fifth. Bassinger
soon showed first with Searchlight, and
holding his field safe won cleverly. Sailor,
with his unsound knee, was a close sec
ond a length ahead of Rasp.
Vasallo, from the Burns & Waterhouse
Ftring. demonstrated that he was a stayer
rnd game by standing a long drive and
beating Carlo a nose for the two-year-old
event, at four and a naif furlongs. Sen
ator Bruce, played for a "killing," cut a
wide swath for -several panels, but
couldn't stand the gaff, dropping in third.
When it came to the pinch Ransch on Va
sallo outfinished Alexander astride Carlo.
Mellocole did not carry his speed very'
far in the seven-furlong selling run, and
MccGyle. also piloted by Ransch, got the
verdict over Hindoonet oy a neck. Faunt
leroy on the latter horse was pocketed
and compelled to take up down the
stretch, or he would have won. With a
stronger ride Jim Hale, which ran third,
xÂ»-ould have been dangerous.
Another good thing. Coal Oil Johnny,
went amiss in the four-furlong dash for
two-year-olds.. With Henry Shields on his
back he tin-canned out in front almost to
the wire, when in a fierce drive he was
nabbed and led out a neck by the favorite,
Glendenning. \ Alexander Â«on the last
named youngster put up a strong and
well-timed ride. Louwelsea, cutfooted at
the start, rai a good third. ,
The mile and three furlongs' selling af
fair went to Stromo. played down from 8
to ZVt. Never out of a gallop, the big
gelding passed Imperious when"' ready,
winning easily by three lengths. Sullivan
on Twinkler, the favorite, met with many
mishaps, getting up in time to get the
place from Sylvan Lass.

DOG SHOW OF THE SAN FRANCISCO KENNEL CLUB HAS
A MOST SUCCESSFUL BEGINNING AT MECHANICS PAVILION
y* rj- ECHANICS' PAVILION is now
JfAlAl tne temporary lodgment foi ,as
(W\\ blue-blooded a lot of hlgh-
J V JA. priced canines as have ever been
benched in this city. From the
four points of the compass they came, and
howled and* barked yesterday morning,
afternoon and evening in ah opening chor
us that ushere.l in the annual bench show
of the San Francisco. Kennel Club.
While the classes are not painfully nu
merous nor tho' entry list large, the show
is an improvement on all of its Â¦, prede
cessors in regard to these two attributes.
Besides this, tne Â¦ dogs exhibited-are-cer
tainly of far higher class, the Eastern
material furnishing some rare ribbon win
ners. '
The morning was consumed in making
ready for the afternoon, which brought a
fair attendance." In the evening the aisles
: between the benches were crowded, and
the interest displayed by the public was
of the mild fanatic dog kind. Occasion
ally one of tha rabid enthusiasts would
break out and talk points until even the
pointers fell asleep.
The sporting class of doss is well repre
sented, as are also the St. Bernards,
spaniels and fox terriers. Up to the noon
hour these pedigreed 'and petted darlings
ever done in his short life is to shake blue
ribbons at his friends in neighboring dog
stalls. â¢
While the benching arrangements ;are.
all that can be desired, everything was

ALL arrangements have been made by Chief of Police Sullivan to.,
guard the President from any attack during his visit to San Fran-
Cisco. On the arrival of the President at the Third and Townsend *
street depot the -esponsibility will commince. From that time.until :
the illustrious guest leaves the .city he .will be guarded by a picked -
squad or detail of eighteen police officers.'- / ;
Tills squad will be divided into three watches and each detail of six men
will be on duty for eight hours at a time. Of these six men four, will be '
in uniform and the other two will be in citizens' clothes. The two men in ,
plain clothes will be at the elbow, of the President at all times, Including
receptions, banquets and interviews! -In all cases where the President drives
in a carriage four mounted policemen will ride by the side of his carriage.
These precautionary details were all decided upon by. Chief Sullivan late
last night. It I* believed they will prevent all chance of assault or Insult
by cranks or others who, make public men their targets. When the Pres
ident visits New York he Is guarded by two detectives, who are picked from"
the corps for their aptness for the work. When he goes for a drive' a de
tective is always seated on the box seat with the driver, and even when
he attends divine service the detective is always given a seat in the next
pew.
EIGHTEEN PICKED MEN
WILL GUARD PRESIDENT
Continued From Page Tvro.
While the reception to the President was
in progress in the Van Nuys Hotel the
women's clubs of the city were giving a
reception to Mrs. McKinley. At first it
was not certain Mr3. McKinley could -go,
but when the time came she said shs
would attend and she did. It was a most
pleasant affair and hundreds of ladies
embraced the occasion to meet the Presi
dent's wife. The reception was held in
the women's clubhouse on Flgueroa street.
It was no part of the programme that
the President should attend the women's
reception, but after the reception to him
in the Van Nuys he had a few mlnutea
to spare, and he said he would like to see
1 he ladies. On his arrival at the club
house the President's first thought was
for his wife, who was holding a brief
court in the women's clubhouse. . .
The President's visit .was an unexpected
pleasure to the thousands of . women in
and about the clubhouse. He graciously
made his way through the throng of ad
miring femininity, shaking a hand on the
one side and paying a pretty compliment
on the other, but his eyes were set for
the lady seated at the far end of the re
oeptlon hall, and he made straight toward
Mrs McKinley. The women cheered him
lustily and were touched by his extreme
solicitude for his wife.
The President evidently believed that
Mrs. McKinley had undergone as much
strain as her strength could stand; Tak
ing her right hand tenderly in both of his
Ftrcr.g palms, he whispered to her and in
another moment he was â¢ leading: her
through the throng to the door. Then he
made straight for his carriage, and. amid
the cheers of the crowd, drove off with
liis wife to "The Bivouac," the home of
General Otis, where they were enter
inincd'to-niffht.'-.taSHfSOHB*'â¢*
The party that sat 'down to dinner was

FROM REDLAHDS TO AHGEL CITY.
"There Is one thing about our na
tional characterâ It is not spoiled when
It is transplanted. (Applause and cries
of "Good.") It loses none of its
strength or its virtue or its liberty un
der anv sun or beneath any stars. (Ap
plause.) They say liberty does not
thrive under tropical skies. Did lib
rrty ever thrive more grandly than in
the State of California and through
out our southland? I congratulate j'ou
upon the prosperous conditions you
have created in your State from one
rnd of it to the other, and thank you
from the bottom of my heart for my
self and my associates for this cordial
welcome to your city, which I visit
row for the second time. Twenty years
ago when J was here you had a popu
lation of a little more than eleven
thousand. To-day you have a â¢Popula
tion of more than a hundred thousand,
and in the last decade you have made
a larger gain than any city in the
country of fifty thousand inhabitants
â a gain I believe of over 100 per 'â¢ent.
I congratulate you upon your pros
perity and, wishing for -you all lovÂ©
and contentment in your homes and
gains in all your occupations, I bid
you good afternoon."
"I am glad to be in this great State.
Its population to-day is more than one
third of the entire population of the
I'nlted States over which the flr*t
President presided during eight years.
I cannot stand in this presence wlth
- out recalling those splendid pioneers
of American civilization, Kearny and
Stockton and Fremont, who led in the
paths of progress and civilization and
dedicated this mighty empire of the
Pacific Coast to liberty and union for
over. <Applause.) You have now re
siding in your beautiful city that aged
woman who shared with General Fre
mont in his early and later trials and
triumphs and for her I am sure you
will all join with me in reverent and
ffft=rtiona.tf regard. ('Applause.) Â¦
â¢â¢Havi:nj s'ai.l this much it only re
mains for me to add that I thank you
one and ail for this splendid welcome
and congratulate you upon the happi
, ness and prosperity not only of the
people of vour city and of your State
- but the people of the whole country,
and to felicitate with you that now
this nation of ours is stronger and
more firmly cemented than it has been
before in all its history. (Applause.)
There are more men and women loving
our flag to-day than ever loved it be
fore and there is more respect paid to
it at home and abroad than ever be
fore. *
Liberty Thrives Grandly.
The members of the President's Cabi
net â Secretary of the Navv John D. Long,
Secretary of State John Hay, Secretary
of Agriculture Wilson. Attorney General
Griggs and Postmaster General Smith
took up position on the platfrom and all
around were secret service men to guard
against fanatics doing possible injury to
the President.
After a brief pause, during which Presi
dent McKinley scanned the assemblage
and bowed kindly in answer to the cheer
ful greetings of welcome evidenced by the
applause from, every quarter," Mr. Laugh
lin Introduced Mayor M. P. Snyder, who
extended the freedom of the city.
When the ceremony was completed de
tachments of the throng outside were al
lowed in the corridor. Fifty or sixty per
sons, who were fortunate enough to pro
cure positions near the Main-street en
trance, were passed in one at a time. Po
lice and secret service men formed a nar
row aisle leading up to the platform and
men, women and children came up to the
dais In single file. The President gaye
them a cordial grasp and to each spoke
a word. Then they passed quickly out of
the Fourth-street door to make room for
another squad. The reception continued
for twenty minutes.
As a means of communication with the
entire populace President McKinley
asked If there was not a balcony to the
lioteL. where he could appear for a mo
ment and address the audience.
Manager Potter of the Van Nuys con
ducted him to a room on the second
Ktory. and his presence at the window
with Secretary of State John Hay was
greeted with wild, cheers and a waving
of hats and handkerchiefs. He spoke as
. follows:
"Mr. Mayor and my fellcw citizensâ
I have already been welcomed to this
magnificent State by your chief execu- .
tive in terms of cordiality and good
will, for which I have already made
grateful acknowledgment. I am more
than pleased to be received in this
enthusiastic manner by the people of
the city of Los Angelesâ to receive
from the Mayor of the city the greet
ing- of all the people. I have been
glad to . be welcomed by my cora-
Ipanions of the Loyal Legion of the
1'nited States, by my comrades of the
Grand Army of the Republic and by
all the* people.
"I have met while traveling through
the SoutH many of our old comrades:
but I have met also, marching side by
Fide with them, giving cheer and wel
come to the President of the United
States, their former foes who had met
before on many a battlefield, each the
more resoecting the other and all now
united under one flag and rivaling
each other in love and devotion to our
constitution and our common country.

applause died away as Mrs. McKinley was
seen to reel, and It appeared as though
she was about to faint. The President
supported her and quickly conveyed iier

apartments upstairs and fifteen minutes
elapsed before the President 'returned
downstairs.

after the party had started, however, and
then she drove quietly to the train, where
she remained until the President ; re
turned. In the meantime, however, she
came out upon the rear platform, to the
great delight of the crowd which quickly
gathered, and looked around on the peo
ple and the streets and', the surrounding
country while she bowed and smiled her
thanks for the enthusiasm which her
presence had caused. "Â¦ "v r .',-:
Drive Through Parks.
The drive wa3 through the gardens and
parks and orange groves that make of
Redlands a small corner of paradise.
Down Orange street and under the arch,
through the library grounds and then up
over the hill to Canyon Crest Park was
the route of the drive, and it was followed
to the last turn, with a short run off the
line to let the President sec the Lawton
place, the farm owned by General Law
ton, who was killed in the Philippines.
Canyon Crest Park is perched on the
top of a long ridge that once was bare
of anything but the Â«:haparral. That was
a few years ago. however, but since then
It has been transformed into- a mountain
park of unrivaled beauty, with -winding
roads and interlocking branches, flowers
of every hue and kind and all in almost
tropical profusion. It Is owned by A. K.
and A. H. Smiley, but it practically be
longs to the town, for all I the Smileys
have In Redlands Is unfenced and inviting
and the people. of the town ride or drive
or roam over it as they^ill. ;
1 The park is on the ridge which forms
one wall of the valley, and opposite It Is
the San Bernardino range. Lying just at
the foot of the ridge is the town, and
then behind are the grim old peaks San
Bernardino and Old Grayback, both
reaching up into the regions of perpetual
frost and both with their rugged old
heads crowned with snow and gleaming
white in the sunlight. It was a sight that
the President paused more than once to
feast his eyes upon "and which called forth
comments that would have driven the
townspeople delirious with joy had they
heard them.
Redlands Proud of Programme.
The people of Redlands prided them
selves upon their programme. They had
everything figured down to minutes and
so when the party, left the hotel for the
drive twenty minutes ahead of 'time the
committee of arrangements held a jubi
lation and began to speculate on the
chances of a speech after the President
had returned to the train. Nor were they
disappointed. ' ...
He got to the "train at fifteen minutes
to 12, and for. most of that time he stood
on the platform and bowed his acknowl
edgements to the crowd's greeting. And
then the people began to crowd closer
and closer until one, more daring than
the others, stretched forth his hand and
the President leaned over the railing and
grasped it. At once there was such a
waving of hands as would have started
a cyclone and the President grasped them
all, regardless of color or cleanliness, ase
or sex. ...
Then there were cries for a speech, not
loud ones, for the committees had drilled
into the people that It was hopeless- but
there was a wild cheer when the Presi
dent stepped forward to the railing to
speak. And he did say a few words that
set the townspeople cheering as they had
not cheered before, for he said that for
a town only twelve years old. it was the
best he had seen in his travels. He said:
"My Fellow Citizens: I have already
spoken at some lenjrth to a great as
sembly of my fellow-citizens in your
beautiful city and I appear r.ow only

them to other factions as better-fitted to play
Moses in 1904 and lead the party out of the wilder
ness than any other man; but just as rapidly as he is
brought forward does each : leader in turn make his
little bow to the public and scurry to the rear. -There
is not one of them who is willing to stand up and
meet the fight for the next three years. Each and all
prefer to remain unsung and unnoted for a time, evU

Some v time ago Bryan himself announced in the
Commoner, that he* is not:a candidate for r renomina
tion. Then the -crowd turned to Tom L. Johnson,
who had just carried Cleveland on a municipal plat
form demanding three-cent , fares on street car lines.
Mr. Johnson w*as .roomed- quite '.vigorously for' ; a
while, but he rebuked the ardent. ,In a public letter
he declared an intention to devote himself strictly to
his duties' as Mayor for the next two years, and as
serted with emphasis he would no.t be a candidate
for the'goverriorship, or a United States Senatorship,
or any othe. office that is supposed to be a stepping
stone to the Presidential nomination. .,_
After that dechration from Johnson the Democratic
seekers cast thtir eyes upon David Bennett Hill.
That statesman had emerged from the . retirement of
his country .home., and; had in- organizing a
formidable opppsitipn to Tammany^all. It was be
lieved he was in the fight for the Presidency as. well
as for the blood of Cfoker, and, the clans 'began .0
rally, some for him and some , against him. For a
time it looked as if there might ;be. something 'doing
in that quarter, but appearances were. deceptive. '.-Mr.
Hill is as' war;'- as Bryan or Johnson. has de
clared himself out -of politics and announced He is
not a candidate. . - â¢'â¢
It is to be noted that in neither case dp the declara
tions go to the extent of asserting anything" more
than an unwillingness to be considered a candidate
at this.time for a nomination which as -yet is so far
off. Bryan said:- "If I ever be'eorrie a candidate again
it will be because it seems necejssary^for the advance
ment of the principles to which I adhere."- Of course
Bryan will be himself the sole judge of whether or
no the necessity exists, so that if he appear as a can
didate in 1904 he' cannot be charged with stultifying
himself.; ' i 'â¢ . - Â¦'. .
- Johnson's statement goes no further than to. assert
an . intention to .confine himself to municipal "-busi-,'
ness for^the . next- two â¢years. After, that Mr -John- ;
son may: be acandidate. -:.Hill's declaratipn isequally
capable 'of. liberal construction two years frorn "now.,
He says : . "I \yill . state: further that I am not a'c^ndi
date ,for, ; the Democratic' Presidential, nomination ' in
1904. I am .neither, seeking the nomination nor," ex
pecting- it. I-regai-dfaU- suggestions ;of candidates; at
AT; the: recent memorial banquet of "the .Grant
Monument Association in' New York the most
notable address was that of Senator Chandler
oriJ'National. Hopefulness." The Senator is now '.'a
statesman out of a job" and it might have been ex
pected his defeat would cause him to take gloomy
views of the politics of the time; but his natural buoy
ancy and his confidence in^the people have saved him
from that evil. He dealt, frankly with each of the
perplexing problems: now before the country and
pointed out the methods by which they can be rightly
solved.
- Of the "trust' r problem which has been so perplex
ing to many he said: "As to the trusts. Tlie people
have them in their, own hands. Not a trust can exist
without corporations. No individual or partnership
of individuals can get together money enough. to make
a, dangerous trust.' 'They -must have the use di cor
poration organization. These organizations are solely
the 'creation of law. They. are made by the'Legisla
ture's,' and the Legislatures which make the'corpora
tions can limit their powers and can destroy the cor
porations if they see fit to .do so. . The. question as
to trusts is merely a* question' what the people will
finally desire. That they will"- desire to | prevent all
large associations of capital is not , probable.. That
they will be willing to let. incorporated trusts destroy
the principle of competition, which has been the life
of trade since the dawn of civilization, and. to permit
the suppression. of individual enterprises by. aggrega
tions of Wealth controlled 'by a ; few. men, with enor
mous fortunes, is ; possible. Either competition
or" governmental control; will be insisted ,upoh. --The
people have jnore votes than the trusts." '. ;' . ' " '
* Passing to a consideration of the government , of
cities,' which, is said, tc be the weak point in our sys
tem, he reminded, his. auditors that when corruption
in municipalities goes far the people combine against
it. Even in New York-City, where corrupt forces
are more ; strongly organized and niore securely- en 1
trenched â¢ than anywhere else, â¢ there are : now. ample
evidences Â¦â¢ that the 'intelligence arid morality !6f ths
people will suffice to" overthrow them at the coming

NATIONAL HOPEFULNESS.
THE STATE AND IRRIGATION.
T j YDROGRAPHER NEWELL of the Geologi-
I â I cal Survey, who has greatly benefited the West
Â¦*â¢ -*Â¦ by his observations, very naturally regrets the
failure of a State appropriation for irrigation work, to
be expended in conjunction with the Federal Govern
ment. Of course it is to be deplored that his excel
lent, useful and necessary investigation of our water
supply, waste and runoff of- streams must be inter
rupted, but it should lead to an improved condition
of things which, by economizing resources now non
productive of revenue and in process of waste, vvill
render both Federal and State /appropriations un
necessary.
If a farmer should let his fertile land go untillcd and
unproductive while he borrowed money to live on he
would rank as a very poor farmer and a very unwise
man. Common sense would take him by the shoulder
and command him to plow and plant and harvest,
and gain thereby the means of a livelihood. -â¢ The
States in the arid West and the Federal Government
are exactly .imitating such a farmer. 1 They are per
mitting waste of the means which would amply pro
vide for hydrographic work, and are borrowing, or
trying to borrow, by forced loan from the taxpayers,

TO PROTECT AN INVENTIONâAnx.
iou3 Inquirer, City. To protect an Inven
tion pending the issuance of a patent on
the same, an Inventor should obtain a
caveat from the Patent Omce at Wash
ington.
A caveat, under the patent law, is a notice
given to tbe office of the caveators" claim as
Inventor, in order to prevent the grant of a
patent to another for the same alleged inven
tion uDon an application filed during the . life
of a caveat without notice to the caveator.
Any citizen of the United States who - has
made a new Invention or discovery and de
sires further time to mature the same may, on
payment of a fee of ten dollars, file in the.
Patent Office a caveat setting forth the object
and the distinguishing characteristics of the
invention, and praying prots-ctlon of bis right
until he shall have matured hts Invention.
Such caveat shall be filed in the confidential
archives of the office and preserved In secrecy,
and shall be or>:rative for the term of one
year from the filing thereof. The caveat may
be renewed, an request In writing;. - by the
payment t>f a second fee of $10, and it will
continue in force for one year from the pay
ment of such second fee. - Â¦ ' .
The caveat must comprise a specification,
oath. and. when, when the nature of the ca*e
admits of it, a. drawing, a-nd. Ilk* the appli
cation, must be limited to a simile invention
or lirrrovensent.
After' the filing, of such notice, the in
ventor should engage a reputable patent
agent, who will secure patent for
him. .' BMBSVBmHBMHMmI

THE BUFFALO -EXPOSITION.
BUFFALO? opened her ! exposition . on time, but
"i she openedjit quietly, so as not to attract too
.;Â¦; close an- investigation into the extent to which'
she had kept her promise tpkuve it ready as.well'as;
open bn-Mayday.. It appears from our Eastern
changes the fair, like all 'other large expositions,- was'
on. the opening day- in^a Very incomplete condition.
The correspondent of the New York Sun- says of ; its
appearance at: the V opening.:' ,; "To-day the evidences
of incompleteness were offered by scaffoldings sur
rounding <fomes, ; minarets^and ' spires, by unpaved
streets and .walks, Venetian -* 'canals without water, r
gondoliers without gondolas^ Cairo streets whose peo
ple were still held in _ quarantine: in the East; a court
of. fountains which. did fnbti spout, sunken gardens
much in need of gardeners, and huge empty buildings,'
waiting the* installation of their exhibits." â¢ i
. Despite the incompleteness, -Svhich was due largely
to the excessive rains that marked the month of April
all over thVEast," enough was^'visible. to the spectator
"on Mayday to render it .certain- the \ completed expo
sition wiirbeone of -the most attractive ever seen",
not excepting the wonderful .white, city at Chicago, or
the marvels of the great Parisian*; triumph of last year.
A notable, feature of the Buffalo' fair is the liberal
and artistic use made of color. The diiebvery^of a
method of making, staff hold paint ;has enabled the
managers of the present. exhibition t'o accomplish bril
liancies, of wall decoration that at the time of the.Chi
cago fair were deemed impossibilities" Full advantage
has been; taken of the discovery, and' it is 'said all
concessionaires were compelled to conform with the
color directors' ideas, arid even the s Government was
forced to repaint its building after a controversy, in
which a dull/gray yielded to a Spanish yellow. No
artistic effect. has been overlooked in the' design of
bridges, towers, esplanadej canals and (approaches.
The triumph of the Buffalonians, however, is to be
achieved mainly in the' electrical display. They have
all the power of Niagara to" draw "upon, and they are
making the most or it. 'Even in the present incom-*
plete state it is said that in the lighting effects"the
Pan-American surpasses all other expositions that
have ever been held. The power being ample,, the
electrical engineers connected with the exposition
were given a free hand to do what they could, and they
have been prodigal. It appears, then; we may account
this. as another American triumph; once -more we
have broken past" records and set a new standard in
the, way of. industrial expositions. ;

THE PRESIDENTIAL CIRCLE.
THE map of the United States is a big map.
Several of the countries ,which consider them
selves large and important can be put inside, of
it and leave enough space vacant for all of 'our own
population. Since the adoption of the constitution
twenty-four citizens have filled the Presidential office
and have administered government over all that large
map. ., ! â¢ Â¦-Â¦: .
President McKinley, sue essor to them all, is now
on the soil of California: To reach us he has traveled
over meridians 55 of 'longitude and has twice crossed
10 degrees of latitude/ It is a great country in area
and other elements of greatness which do not depend
upon width of "borders. . ' .-
/ President McKinley hails from a birthplace . far
away from us iin^miles,- but near in interest. . He is
from the center, of what may be called the Presidential
circle. With Xolumbus, the capital of Ohio, as. the
center of;a : circle of, 300 miles radius, the interesting
fact appears^ that Â¦â¢â¢-of . the tWenty : four. Presidents
twenty-one were born in or elected from States within
that circle. It touches Virginia, the â¢ native soil of
Washington, - Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, William
Henry Harrison, 'Tyler and Taylor. ; Within^ it is
Tennessee, from which Jackson, Polk and Johnson
were elected, and .New York, with Van Buren, Fill
more, Arthur and^Geveland. That magic circle in
cludes Pennsylvania, . with Buchanan ; Illinois, with
Lincoln and Graht*';Iridiana, with Benjamin Harrison,
and Ohio, with her illustrious sons, Hayes, Garfield
and McKinley. : ... â¢Â¦
Of these five were born in Ohio â Grant, Hayes,
Garfield/ Benjamin Harrison arid McKinley.. â¢ So that
that small circle, when "compared with the vast area
of the country, has been potential in producing Presi
dential timber, and the crop it has furnished is un
equaled in excellence and- serviceable qualities. It is
all -within the territory of the original thirteen colo
nies and was recognized by England in the treaty- of
peace made in 1783. -, Â¦,
Not only have one score and one Presidents
sprung from within that circle, , but their pub
lic history is interestingly interlinked. Jefferson
took in Louisiana, and Grant, Garfield, Hayes,
Harrison and v McKinley fought to save for Â¦ it
the Union in \ the Civil War, as Jackson had
fought to keep it out of Great Britain's hands in
the war of 1812. Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana in
"cluded the boundary line complications, which led t,o
the independence of Texas, and Tyler took that re
public in as an American State, and Taylor fought out
the remaining boundary disputes in the war with
Mexico, and Polk clo&ed the 7 account that was opened
in 1803 by the annexation of California, Nevada, Utah,
Arizona and parts of Colorado,. Wyoming and New!
Mexico. â¢ .
In the Civil War Lincoln stood guard over the in
tegrity of the Union, and McKinley has pioneered the
extracontinental extension of our borders, â¢ while
Cleveland wrote into international law" the. hemispheri
cal hegemony declared as the doctrine of Monroe.
Yet a short journey of three hundred miles from
Columbus, Ohio, will land you in the States where all
these Presidents were born, or whence they .we're
elected.
It is probable that no similar area on the planet- has"
furnished, outside of a royal dynasty, an equal number
of men who have as greatly influenced the world and
the destiny of' mari.^ VJ. t : . ; . . .
i - Outside of a royal idynasty, we have said, because
all of these republican citizens' were the : choice of their
fellows in the greatest free society that has existed.'
They influenced destiny and compelled fate, not by any,
autocratic authority, nor assertion of divine right,
nor prerogative, but they were endowed with power
by free suffrage because their all compelling quali
ties had marked them for the confidence of their coun
trymen. . . â¢ -, . '
They form an illustrious company, and; their mem
ory as well as the glory of the area that gave them to
history might well be perpetuated by building at Co*

weight. The growth of the brain Is very
rapid during the first year of life, and
much less in subsequent years, but by the
seventh year it, has .attained fully 90 per
cent of Its total future -weight. While the
processes of growth and development go
on together," in the first seven yean? the
brain change as pre-eminently that of
growth and thereafter pre-eminently that
of development. No organ of the body
can be affected so f much. "by proper train

lazily from side to side, stretching out all
four hands into the air wishing. to grasp
something, but hardly able to guide its
ringers to : any definite I object; arid when
dissatisfied, opening wide its almost tooth
less mouth, and expressing its wants by.
a most Infantine scream. The little mon

tion; running and jumping about wher

objects, with Â¦ the greatest precision, bal

running ud a post and helping itself to
anything eatable that came in its way.
There could hardly be a greater contrast,
and. the baby Mias looked more babylike
by the comparison."
Of Â¦ the various animals reviewed, it is
to be noted the higher the intelligence of
the adult animal and.ithe more complex
its; life activities tfie^longer is its infancy
or period - of development. â¢ Each increase
in brain size is accompanied by increase in
intelligence, and generally speaking this
increase in intelligence is accompanied by
greater complexity of the life of the indi
vidual; that is, there is a greater variety
of experiences and a more numerous de
velopment of faculties, and hence a great
er. number of nerve connections to be es
tablishefi to direct and control these fac
ulties and their resulting activities. Fin
ally there cornea a time when the nec
essary nerve connections cannot all be es
tablished before birth, but must be partly
established by education after birth. Thus
is infancy established, for any animal re
quiring postnatal* development' which
should happen not to have a period of
infancy would cease to exist. Even in
the human family \ it is far from uncom
mon to meet Instances where both pre
natal and postnatal development are
from some cause or other hindered, and
where in consequence the resulting indi
vidual would certainly cease^to exist were
it not for the fostering care which highly
organized society gives him.
Valuable Period of Plasticity.
Of all animals, with one 'exception, to
be noted presently, man has the most pro
longed infancy, or period of development,
both actually in number of years and rel
atively so far as the percentage of the
total duration of life, which is given up
to development, is concerned. To quote
the- expressive language of John Fiske,
"It is babyhood that has made man what
he is.". l â¢
With the exception of the elephant man
has a longer period of plasticity, or', of '
development, ' than any other animal;
Man's plastic period lasts twenty years,
the elephant's lasts ~ upward of thirty
years. ' During its growing period the ele
phant has an enormous . bulk to acquire
and most of its growth processes must
be directed to that end. Influences which
would act strongly to differentiate, the
young elephant from its hereditary ten
dencies would Â¦ necessarily tend to inter
fere with its â¢ acquirement of bulk and
hence make* it less- liable to survive,
which would precent the establishment in
the species of any variation so produced. !
The great reason, after all, why it has
not evolved" higher lies in the. failure of
the" elephant's Drain to develop.: which is
itself the: result of the highly specialized
structure . of the animal.
1 Rapid growth Is antagonistic to perma
nence of environmental Â¦ impressions and
is inimical to the life of the individual, at
least in the case of the human infant. ;
Susceptibility to Environment.
During the period of most rapid growth
of the child, that is, during the first year
of life, deep Impressions are readily made
upon the organism, which reacts almost
violently to stimuli, which later would
have little or no influence. Sickness is
Â¦ produced by causes which in older chil- ;
dren or adults would be incapable of pro- j
ducing any noticeable deviation from
health. Moreover, pathological conditions
which would not interfere in the least
with the growth or development of the
older child interfere markedly with the
growth of the infant. But the very con
dition of hyperplasticity. which permits
these effects to occur serves also to wipe
them out quickly and apparently com
pletely. The result of this hyperplastlcity
to the individual is great danger, as is
shown by the high mortality of infancy.
/Nor Is it of any benefit or harm to the
race except as it destroys. infant life, for
we look almost in vain in the later his
tory of the individual, . for any effects
from the environmental causes active In j
infancy. Later, ntowever, when the plas
ticity is lesa and the rate of growth and
development is slower, effects from en
vironmental influences become more last-
Ing, provided those influences are suffi
ciently prolonged in their action. L - : -
. Prolongation of the period of develop
ment, associated wipi a certain low de
gree of plasticity, possibly an essential j
corollary of the prolongation, are factors
which are essential not "only to the ad- j
vancement of the race, but also to tl*e
welfare of the individual, -^gggg
: Safety in Average Development.
An important deduction from this propo
sition is this: The individual is safest
when his development follows most close
ly the average or mean. There are many
instances which this. Infants
whose"- size and weight are much above
the average for their age are generally!
anaemic and are notoriously difficult to.
nourish. Children who are born with liv
ers ill developed in function are the vic
tims of many pathological processes, some
of which cause merely suffering., others
involve the future .life and health of the
individual and rtill others threaten and at
I times actually destroy .life. The girl or
boy who at the age of -13 or 14 has a
much 'greater acceleration of growth than
normal puts so .much energy into this
process that excessive fatigue results, and
if the" -ordinary vocations are continued
the child is often permanently damaged.
"Growth sometimes occurs so, rapidly that
the heart cannot keep Up with the in
creased 'work thrown upon Â¦ it, becomes
overworked and -Is damaged to 'the extent
that it is neglected. The most striking il
lustrations .of this> truth are to be found
in tbe cases- of unusual precocity which
from time to time have: teen 'noted. The
average is best for the individual.- and
while advancement of the race demands
deviation from, the \ average no altruism
yet evolved requires -"one to welcome or
foster it. .-. . " v . , 'â¢ Â¦, . . ..
' ' Â¦Â¦ Plasticity of the Organs. .
; Thus,; far; plasticity of the organism as
'a -whole has : alone been referred to, but
plasticity^ of Individual organs must also
be taken -into . account. -- At birth ; there is
a great range of the degree'of growth and

PROFESSOR OF THE DISEASES OF CHILDREN, MEDICAL SCHOOL OF THE
XII.â DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHTLD.
At birth the average male infant weighs
7.5 1 pounds and ': 20.6 inches long! | The
average;man. of 25 has a stature of 6S.3
inches and a weight of .148 pounds. Thus
in the - twenty-five i years â¢ the stature be
comes about, three and one- third and the
weight about twenty times the Â» corre
sponding - measurements at . birth. These
figures ";. indicate % the ; enormous changes
which occur during tho. period' of growth
and* development of the individual. > Re
stricting ; figures , to ' averages," it is found
that during* the first year the boy gains
in: height; 8. 4 finches ' and in weight 13
pounds, "or," expressed in percentage,- the
gain' in' height is 41 per cent and in weight
is 173 per cent. ..Not only are these per
centages of increase never again
even approximated in the growing period
of the individual, but the actual increase
is never again reached in any one year.
: "While- the. actual figures /differ; some
what in the other sex, the results in gen
eral are the same. .-Â¦..-.. Â¦Â¦' â¢ >
During the second year of life the rate
of 'change slackens rapidly and while
growth and development still proceed, the
process_gs go . on at I a very moderate rate
compared with, that ot> the first year. :
P ! Peril of the First Year of Life.
These simple facts' -indicate the im
portance of the first year of life in the de
velopment of the Â¦: individual. It is the
year of . greatest ; internal â¢ activity, - or
metabolism, as it is technically called. It
is the year of great plasticity. ; It is the
year, of greatest adjustment of the indi
vidual to his . environment. In conse
quence of these facts it isalsothe year
of greatest mortality. The mortality in
this .year of lif e. Â¦<Â¦ as . shown Â¦ by English
statistics, is about 15 per centâ a rate not
again reached until the age of 80: In
many cities infant mortality reaches a
much' higher figure. It is also, important
tu/note that much of the mortality of in
fancy occurs in the early part of tnls first
>car. Thus Julius Eross, who studied
the statistics of sixteen large- European
cities, and whose study 'included over
1,400.000 children, found that 10, per cent
of the children born alive died within the
nret four weeks of life. .The mortality of
the first year of life is about double that
of typhoid fever, so that It iff no exagge
ration' to say that to be an infant under 1
year of age is twice as dangerous as to
have typhoid fever, although the danger
decreases with each week of life.
After -the second year growth proceeds
in a fairly even way. until the age of about
11 or 12 years is reached, when an accele
ration occurs, lasting from three to live
years. ' '
! â¢ i , Irregularity of Growth. -
Thus the growth of the individual as a
whole proceeds Irregularly. Irregularity
in growth is true also- of the several or
gans of the body. An additional fact of
ritmfe importance regarding the different
structures^ is their varying growth with
relation to each other and the consequent
change of relationships which they come
to bear. -Thus at birth the eye constitutes
about one-fourth of 1 per cent of .the en
tiro weight of the body, while in the
adult it is only one-tenth as much.% It
does not '.quite double its weight; while
the whole; body increases twenty fold.
The brain increases its birth weight about
three and one-half times and does practi
cally all of this in the first seven years of
life. The muscles, on the other hand, are
increased in weight- twenty-eight times
and- acquire most of this increase after
the age of 12.- v
The changes-, which occur in the first
twenty years of life may be covered by,
two terms, which are frequently con
founded, but which are essentially differ
ent. These terms are growth, which is
quantitative, and refers especially io size,
and development, â¢ which is qualitative,
and refers to change of function, to ad
justment of the varying organs and struc
tures to each other," and of the body as a
whole to its environment. J
v Inherited and Acquired Skill.
The broadest and most profound, and at
the same time the most useful conception
of infancy, or rather of the developmental
period of life," ever formulated is that of
John Fiske. A brief presentation of
Flskc's theory may here- be given. The
life of the codfish is a simple one. Its
iicte are mostly concerned with tho secur
ing of food < and the avoidance of danger.
These acts are'few in kind and require
for their performance, "Only a very slight
intelligence. . Its experiences, while nu
merous . enough possibly, quantitatively,'
are so' much of a kind that practically
they require only the monotonous repeti
tion'of the same few acts. So few are
these acts, . and so limited the nervous
connections necessary to. their proper per
formance, that they become 'established
by heredity, and the young codfish enters
upon its life capable of performing all of
them about-as well as its ancestors. It
Â¦has ' Ultle .to learn -from "experience. It
.requires no education.'. It has no Infancy.
Consider on the other hand an expert
pianist. *He, acquires the skill to read his
nuifcic slowly;- he acquires the skill to per
form it stumblingly; but- finally- he will
perform' the most difficult music at sight,"
and do it easily. Slowly has ho developed
the nervous connections necessary .to
thtse-acts. * They were not developed'at
birth. -Analogous has been the develop
ment of the great artist, the great poet,
the. great warrior, the great mathemati

The following named were elected offi
cers of Golden Gate Commandery,
Knights Templar, at a meeting in Golden
nia Bank Identified receipts for the with
drawal of money from the banks by
O'Hare recently. . The Hlbernia Bank's
receipts amount to $8000 and the receipts
of the German Bank amount to $3000. The
case was then continued till this after
noon. &
Considerable time was occupied in the
introduction- of letters written by Mrs.
Jacques to Mrs. Mary Jane Rodgers of
Minneapolis, a sister of O'Hare: to Mrs.
Rodgers' husband and to her daughter
Tillie. Letters were also introduced that
were sent by Mrs. Jacques to Mrs. T.
Lally, another sister of O'Hare. In addi
tion the prosecution presented telegrams
that had passed between the Jacques fam
ily and the Rodgers family. The letters
represented O'Hare as being the picture
of health. He was also said to have
taken a great dislike for Mrs. Gowdey,
another '^sister, who is the complaining
witness lnlhe case. In one letter it was
stated that O'Hare had given Mrs. Gow
dey $500 about five years ago, which was
all that he intended to give her.
There was no denial on the part of the
defendants of. the authenticity of the
letters and telegrams. They
took the stand and identified them, after
which they were admitted as evidence.
It is claimed for the defendants that the
letters show that Mrs. Jacques was
anxious to inform O'Hare's relatives as to
his condition. The fact that Mrs. Jac- ;
ques had asked Mrs. Rodgers to come
here and take her brother away, it is
claimed, shows that there was no desire I
on the part of the defendants to kidnap !
O'Hare. On the other hand the prosecu- >
tion claims that the letters show clearly j
that they were written to give a false im- |
pression as to O'Hare's condition, the ex
pert witnesses having testified that he
was suffering from senile - decay. The
letters, it was claimed, also that
there was a motive in misstating O'Hare's
condition so that his relatives should be
antagonized, thus affording the defend
ants an opportunity to carry out their in
tention of getting. him out of the city. .
Thomas G. J. Jacques Jr. was sworn
and admitted that he took O'Hare to Oak
land on April 18. The next day He was

. Three discharged soldiers went ln^o a
variety show at- Jackson and Kearny

revolvers, proceeded to make things live

sent for Policeman Cavanatigh, who, after
a short battle, placed the men under ar

Father McQuade next told of the won
derful beauty of Rome â its monuments
and ruins. He was present at the open
ing: of the door in St. Peter's at the be
ginning of the new century, and his de
scription of r one of the most solemn and
impressive ceremonies of modern times
was received with intense appreciation by
the audience.
Accompanied by Archbishop Riordan,
Father McQuade was granted the honor
of an audience with Pope Leo, who,- in
spite of his many years, is still able to
coi.duct the longest services.
Tho affair was so complete a' success
and the appreciation of Father McQuade's
lecture so great that efforts will be made
to have him repeat It in the near future
in a hall where a larger audience may be
accommodated. â¢
He then gave a description of the
beauties and peculiarities of Shanghai
and discussed the causes of the . recent
Boxer disorders. "It was not the mission
aries who were at the bottom of the
troubles,". he said, "but the railway engi
neers. The Chinese, more than any
of the earth's peoples,' venerate the dead,
and because the railroads have been built
directly through .their little cemeteries,
which are spread about everywhere, they
have been stirred. to a degree beyond en-
Father McQuade then spoke on "Trav
els on Two Continents." He described in
brief his trip across the Pacinc Ocean,
giving; a slight description of Honolulu
and Its cosmopolitan peoples. The beau
ties of .Yokohama and Nagasaki were
then portrayed in a most interesting man
ner. ,. . j'^'-'i'
"The Japanes'e people," he said, "I
found to be made up of equal parts of
immorality, dishonesty, politeness and
simplicity."" Father McQuade then spoke
of tne progress of the Catholic church in
Japan axid the benefits its teachings have
bi ought to the natives. Â»
The entertainment, preceding the lec
ture by Rev. Father McQuade, consisted
of vocal and instrumental selections and
recitations by members of the parish. A
fancy dance by little Annie Driscoll was
a particularly pleasing feature. The reci
tation by Thomas hickey and musical
specialties by William Hynes were en
cored again and again. A piano solo by
Miss Eveline Beaudet, vocal solos by
Mrs. M. McGIade and Frank Scully and a
recitation by Miss A. â¢ Dwyer were well
rendered and "favorably received.
An interesting and successful entertain
ment and lecture was given at Mission
Parlor Hall last night under the auspices
of Annunciation booth of the Most Holy
Redeemer Church. The hall was crowded
to its utmost capacity and every feature
of the programme was received with the
heartiest applause. v â¢ v '.: : ;- . ; : 1

largest producers of McKlttrick are also eign
ers to the compact, and the design of those as
sociating- is to bring up the price of oil to at
least Â£0 cents per barrel and to hold it at
that figure, to the end that the business may
be prosecuted at a profit and that consumers
may be assured that their competitors will not
be able to have an advantage over them in the
purchase of fuel.
The association of the oil men operating
in the Fresno-San Bonito district will be
perfected at a meeting to be held in the
assembly-room of the Mills building to
morrow evening. All companies owning
lands in the district are requested to send
representatives to the meeting. The pro
ject of establishing a bureau of informa
tion will be discussec and action may be
taken. Permanent officers will be elected.
The statistics which Charles G. Yale is
preparing for the State Mineralogist for
the annual report of the production of
mineral substances of California for the
current year will probably clear up the
question of the actual production of oil
in the State by counties and by districts.
Mr. Tale is working on the problem with
all the facilities available with the pur
pose of getting the most reliable statistics
possible.
Mining districts are to be formed in the
Midway and Sunset districts, the purpose
being to prevent the operations of land
jjmpers principally. Each district wiil
pass regulations. Attorneys have been
employed to draw up the necessary papers
preliminary to the formation of the dis
tricts.
A rush has" set in from Tucson, Yuma
and mining camps to Texas Hill, Arizona,
on the report of a discoverv of oH. Land
has been located along a belt twenty-five
miles long, extending from Texas Hill
along the Gila. Two companies have been
organised at Tucson to drill for oil. There
is also some excitement because of the
alleged discovery of oil in the San Pedro
Valley, near St. David.
"Work in Shasta County.
The Redding Searchlight, Shasta Coun
ty, says: %
The site on which the third oil well in Shasta
County will be drilled has been selected. The
Keswick Crude Oil Company, which is ready
for business, has decided to build its derrick
on land held by the company in section 13.
township 22 north, range 5 west. The site is
in Sand Flats and is only 800 feet west of the
Mount Shasta Oil Company's well, at which
operations are for the present suspended The
site is five miles north of Redding. The Kes
wick company has purchased its rijj in San
Francisco. The lumber for the derrick bought
at Portland, lies at the Keswjck depot await
ing to be hauled to the site. This company
will begin to drill as quickly as the derrick
can g-o up" and the machinery be placed in
position.
Central Oil Producers.
The Bakersfield Californian, speaking of
the progress of the movement in that
section toward making an effective com
bination of the producers, says:
Practically the whole of the Kern River dis
trict Is in the association and most of the
0 v,.
The chances would seem to be excellent
for the completion of two organizations
fox the same general purpose In the State,
namely, the protection of the oil producers
from the rapacity of any and all comers
and from the evils that naturally flow
from a lack of common understanding in
marketing. Practically all of the pro
ducers of the Kern River and McKittrlck
districts are reported to have agreed to
the plan proposed to them for combina
tion. On the other hand the Los Angeles
Coucly producers are seemingly in pos
session of a plan tnat bids Tair to offer
an interesting experiment, at least for
those engaged in it. The title of the Los
Angeles combination is the Los Angeles
Oil Producers' Association. The general
p'.an is like a stock company with a cap
ital represented by 2U0C shares, one of
which will be issued for each pumping
well. Members pledge themselves to sell
all their product through the association.
The incorporators are nine in numberâ

Details, such as the grading: of oil and the
tankage, have not been settled, but will be
presented at the first meeting of the subscrib
ers. Extensive plans are. however, being con
sidered, not the least of which Is a campaign
of education. At present there la a srowinR
surplus, due to a slight excess in the output
over the consumption. There are two ways
open to rid the market of the surplus, one be
ing to decrease the output and the other to in
crease the demand. The former the oil men
do not favor, as they are of the opinion that
many that are now using- coal in Los Angeles,
the city government included; might be induced
to give the home product a trial of it were

"I do not feel very well, I am so
tired all the time. 1 do not know what
is the matter with me."
You hear these wcrds every day; as
often as you meet your friends just so
often are these words repeated. More
than likely you speak the same signifi-
cant words j-ourself . and no doubt you
do feel far from well most of the time.
Mrs. Ella Rice, of Chelsea, Wis.,
whose portrait we publish, writes that
ehe suffered for two years with bear-
ing-down pains, headache, backache,
and had all kinds of miserable feelings,
all of which was caused by falling and
inflammation of the womb, and after
doctoring 1 with physicians and numer-
ous medicines she was entirely cured by
. Mks. Ella Kick
Lydia E. Pinkharn's Vegetable Com-

If you are troubled with pains,
fainting- spoils, depression of spirits,
reluctance to go anywhere, headache,
backache, and always tired, please re-
> member that there is an absolute
remedy which will relieve you of your
suffering as it did Mrs. Rice. Proof
is monumental that Lydia E.- Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound is the
greatest medicine for suffering women.
No other medicine has made the cures
that it has, and no other woman has
helped so many women by direct advice

Hardly One of the Fleet Has Paid
Expenses This Season.
The sealing fleet, so far as reported, has
made a very poor catch this season. The
weather was against them, and vessels
that returned with thousands of skins last
year have not taken hundreds this last
beason. Twenty vessels have got back
to Victoria, B. C, and all they fan muster
between them are 3756 skins. Nine vessels
are still to be heard from, but it is not
thought that they will increase the catch
to EW0 skins all told. t
The catch of the fleet is as follows:
Geneva US. Hatzic 110. Ida Etta 91, Teresa
M, Libbie 107, R. L Morse 68. Florence M.
Smith 352. Allie I. Alger 274. Favorite 161.
Beatrice 294, Ocean Belle 170. Triumph 293,
Viva 332 Otto 240, Penelope 442, Arietis
300, Anioka 76. E. B. Marvin 220, Zillah
May 220 and Annie E. Pain 140. The fol
lowing schooners have still to be heard
from: Dora Sieward, C. B. Rand, Victo
r'a. Diana, Sadie Turpel, Saucy Lass, Um
brina, Carrie C. W. and Walter L. Rich.
So far not one of the fleet has, paid ex
penses, and the hunters will have to work
on coasting vessels instead of taking a
lay-off for a couple of months.
Panama Steamships.
The Pacific Hall Company's San Jose
got away for Panama and way ports yes
terday. She was nearly four hours late,
owing to a rush of freight at the last
tuirnite. A fair cargo went away on her,
but there were not many passengers.
The Panama Railroad Company's Roan
oke arrived from Panama direct early
yesterday morning. The run up was
made in twelve days. She did not bring
much freight, and the only cabin passen
gers were T. S. T. Cobb and C. H. Le
Boyteaux. There were five passengers in
the steerace.
Water Front Notes.
The steamer Mexico has again changed
hands and will probably also get a new
name- She has been sold to Seattle parties
and will probably run between Victoria,
B. C, and the gold fields. When she first
went into service the steamship was
known as the Bowen, but when she came
to this coast she was called the Man
aucnse. Under that name she was fitted
out and made a trip for the Government
to Manila. On her return she made a few
trips to British Columbia, but was with
drawn and laid up. Then her name was
changed to Mexico and she was placed in
the Mexican trade. She was again put on
the retired list and now goes to Seattle to
try her luck.
Williams. Dimond & Co. have removed
to their new wharf at the foot of Steuart
street. The bark Albert docked there
yesterday, and the next steamer that ar
rives from New York will also go to that
wharf.
The Union Transportation Company's
new river 6teamer Columbia will have her
trial on the bay to-day. She was for
nierly the Mary Ellen Galvin and was
built for the Yukon River trade. Her en
gines were not powerful enough, however,
and Pat Galvin. for whom she was built,
would not accept her. Her new owners
have had the machinery and boilers re
modeled and now she is expected to make
good time.
Captain Humphreys purchased the gas
oline launch Dell from Henry Peterson
yesterday and will take her to St.
Michael. It is the captain's intention to
run between the various mining camps In
order to keep an eye on his various inter
ests.
The American ship John McDonald is
now uninsurable. She is 233 days out from
Baltimore for San Francisco, and the last
quotation was 95 per cent. The vessel is
now practically given up as lost. The
general impression is that her cargo of
coal caught fire and she was burned at
6ea. .
The British ship Cromartyshire made
the run home of the season. After leav
ing Portland she was caught in a gale and
considerably damaged. She put in here
for repairs, and after an overhauling
made another start. She arrived at Fal
mouth yesterday after a splendid passage
of 104 days.

SEALEBS MAKE POOR CATCH.

the tug Kelialice moved out with the
Wilder In tow ami proceeded to Pea. Doth
totvboat* cast off their tows about the
ramo time, and flve minutes later both
the "wind-Jammers had laid their
courses for the islands. Long before the
tuirs let go both vessels had considerable
canvas set and It did not take long to
puck on the rest of the sail. Captains
Johns-on and Jackson have wagered a
dinner on the race and there is consider
able speculation on the result. This is the
best season of the year for fast time, and
as both vessels Â¦ are clippers ten days
should see them at the islands.

HIS TROUBLES
Dr. Gilbert Leaves the
Chicago Theological
Seminary.
School.
Directors Think His Retire- 1
i - inent Is Best for the Â»
j CHICAGO, May 8.â "What la regarded as,
a compromise verdict was reached by the
directors of the Chicago Theological Sem
inary to-day in the case of Dri George H.
Gilbert, professor of New Testament lit
erature and interpretations of the semi
nary. The .directors voted to accept Dr.
Gilbert's resignation, but- that this action
was .based oh the charge that his teach
ings advanced' in his two books, "Revela
tions of Jesus" and "The Teachings of
the. Apostles,'' . contained heretical para
graphs is not clear. It was said that the
directors did not consider his teachings
in these books as bearing on the charge
of heresy, but concluded in a general way
that it was best for the professor's con
nection ?ith the seminary to cease. To
day's decision does not affect Dr. Gilbert'3
standing Â». in the local Congregational
church- of, which he is a member.
: The charges were first brought against
the author two years ago by the Rev. E.
S. Carr of Stillman, Valley, who declared
that "The .Revelations of Jesus" con
tained passages contrary to the creed of
the seminary. The trouble hinged on the
phrase, "The ideal pre-existence of
Christ." Dr. Carr declared that the
phrase was tantamount to a denial of the
actual pre-existence of Christ. This Dr.
Gilbert emphatically denied, and asked
leave to prepare a second volume further
elucidating his meaning. He was granted
a year's leave of absence, and recently
the advance sheets of this book, were
placed in the hands of the directors^
After considering the two books as a
whole yesterday no one was found to still
advance a charge" that the professor's
teachings, were heterodox. There still re
mained- a feeling, however, that the semi
nary would be better without the author
of the troublesome books, and action was
accordingly taken along that line, Neither
Dv. Carr,- who brought the original aceu.
eatton, nor Dr, Gilbert were present at
the pegfsjon of the directors, I
The board meetings yesterday and to
day were conducted with grÂ«at secrecy,
It is gald that a hpt discussion, begun
yesterrtny , afternoon and lasted far into
the night and th.nt It was again taken
up this forenoon, tha Jtev. W, }3, Harton
leading (i spirited defense of thÂ§ ft<?k'UÂ«*u
feacher, Ur, Gilbert was popular with,
his pupils, and a number of them hftvq
tl)r$ntc*npd to leave the seminary and ge
to Oberliii as a remit of the verdiet.
The report gives the reason for thÂ§ pre
fesaor'a dismlssai thus: "For tha goejt
of tha fleminury and of Dr. Gilbert â ."
H eotieludeu with the highest commen
dation ut the minister as a man and a
Christian, and remarks, "ills consclen-*
tlous loyalty to the truth im it han been
given him to see the truth,"
In a letter from Dr. Gilbert to the di
rectors ha pleads that to-day's view Of
the Bible's teachings is not necessarily
wrong because It is contrary to the view
of fifty years ago.
Movement of Transports.
The cabin passengers of the Egbert
were released from quarantine yesterday.
The prisoners and discharged men will be
larded to-day and the transport will prob
ably dock to-morrow.
The cabin passengers are very indignant
with Dr. Day, the ship's surgeon. They
assert that he never went near the sol
diers, and that Private John Plugge was
down with the smallpox four days before
the fact was known. Then Assistant Sur
geon G. H.. Calkins had to take charge,
andtft was lie. that vaccinated everybody
aboard and cared for the patient there
after until he died. , . . .'
Among those who came over from quar
antine yesterday was I Lieutenant W. K.
Naylor, who distinguished himself at the
battle of San Juan Hill and also at Tien
tsin. G. J. Kavanaugh, who was in China
as the representative of the Chicago Rec
ord, and Lieutenant H. A. AVhite were
also among the released passengers. They
say that f-verything is quiet in China and
that there will be no more fighting.
The transport Warren will not go to
Manila. It has been definitely decided to
Bend her north with supplies, and she will
leave for Seattle, where she will load on
the 12th inst. â¢
The big freight transport Samoa came
off the drydock yesterday and will begin
loading at once. She will take aboard
nbout 4000 tons here. She will. -then go. to
Portland, where' rho will take on about
Â£000 tons more and will finish up at Ta
coma, where she will complete her cargo
of 10,000 tons pf army supplies and fodder.
Forum Club Entertains.
The ladles of the Forum Club celebrated
Forum day yesterday by giving 1 a splen
did entertainment. Mr. Payot gave an in
tensely interesting illustrated lecture en
titled "Under the Shadow of the Pagoda,"
Mrs. Edgerton recited "Qn the Road to
Mandalay ,'.' ; and Miss t Josephine Lindley
gave several vocal selections. - â¢
The affair was one of the most delight
ful of the Reason. There was a very large
attendance. After the -entertainment the
guests spent a pleasant half hour sipping
Russian tea and enjoying social converse.
Mothers' Club Meeting.
The Mothers'- Club of the W. C. T. U.
held a meeting yesterday afternoon and
listened to a splendid paper by Mrs. A. C.
Bainbridge entitled "Moral Purity of the
Home." The paper, a very interesting
and practical one, was followed by. some
instrumental and vocal music. '..- Â¦ : - â¢ .

this character have been taken under
section 1167 of the Penal Code. Lewis
was tried on the charge of forging the
name of Meyer Lewis to a deed of prop
erty on Jackson street. He was Indicted
by the Grand Jury and when the case
was tried before a jury in Judge Lawlor'9
court the plea of insanity was raised and
the Jury, on April 13, acquitted the de
fendant on the ground that he was in
sane at the , time of the crime. Lewis
was ordered into the, custody of the
Sheriff, and the Judge sent him before
the Insanity Commissioners for examina
tion.
"Major" Edwin Lewis was adjudged
insane by a jury in Judge Lawlor's court
yesterday and to-day he will be ordered
sent to the Insane asylum at Napa. The
jury was out for but a few minutes.

be held in Mexico this fall, and former
Minister to Siam, is at the Palace. He
arrived yesterday, and will leave for Port
land next week, after conferring with the
Chamber of Commerce in regard to mat
ters affecting Pacific Coast interests that
will come before this great international
convention. Barrett is the only member
of the United States delegation from the
far West. In a statement concerning this
gathering he says: .
The general public at the present moment
does not appreciate the nature and Importance
of this International - conference of American
States, commonly termed the Pan-American
Congress, that is to be held In Mexico this
fall. It is even confused with the Pan-Ameri
can Exposition in Buffalo and is â¢ described as
a South American exposition to be. held in Mex
ico Instead of a congress.
In due time, however, the wide scope of Its
labors will be understood. It will be the most
significant gathering of nations ever . held in
this hemisphere. Some European papers, in
discussing . its possible effects, declare that it
.will surpass the memorable International peace
conference at The Hague. There will be en
voys, or delegates, in attendance from every
independent nation of North, South and Cen
tral America. This congress will be in session
for two or three months, commencing In Octo
ber. The Mexican Government Is making elab
orate preparations to receive and entertain the
delegates. They will be taken, I am told, over
Mexico and shown its resources and will prob
ably be Invited to visit other Central American
countries. â¢ Â¦ -
If I may be allowed to make an unofficial
suggestion I would say that it would be a good
thing for the Pacific Coast to invite In due
time the foreign delegates at this . convention
to visit this section after adjournment and be
fore they return to their respective capitals.
It will be a long time in the future before we
will have another opportunity of showing such
a large body of distinguished and influential
statesmen of our sister republics what an Im
portant section of the United States the Pa
cific Coast is. The average Latin public man
is limited in his knowledge of our country to
New York and the Eastern seaboard.
Among other leading questions that may'
come before the conference are the following:
Arbitration of all International disputes before
a permanent Pan-American tribunal: reciprocal
tariffs or an International customs union to
facilitate and foster trade; improvement of
postal facilities; better new systems of sea and
land transportation lines: a Pan-American
railway system: the trans-Isthmian canal; bet
ter international banking: arrangements, and.
in short, ways and means of promoting closer
relations of commerce and amity among the
sister countries of the Western hemisphere.

pelting a wooden doll to whirling a wheel
of fortune. There were guessing contests
for the ladles, target shooting for men,
races for fat men and races for thin men,

"A Son of Napoleon" has not aroused
much interest with audiences at the
Grand Opera-house. The play is not as
Sroofi as the players and it is uphill work
for them with the inferior material of
fered. It is excellently staged, the vari
ous scenes of the Napoleonic drama being
faithfully and picturesquely portrayed.
Xext week "Government Acceptance"
will be the bill. '
Next week the theater will have a nov
elty in the appearance of Terry Mc-
Govern. the champion featherweight, in
his play, "The Bowery After Dark," with
all modern improvements.
Like "Uncle Tom's Cabin," "The Oc
toroon" never grows eld. and strong proof
of its perennial interest may be seen in
the size of this week's audiences at the
Central. The old slave drama is beauti
fully staged and is well presented by the
Central forces.
"The Conquerors," now In its third
week at the Alcazar Theater, is still
drawing biff houses. On Monday next it
will give place to "Friends," the favorite
Milton Royle drama, and of which one
clever performance was given at the
theater on Monday evening last
â¢ â¢ â¢
The long ajid successful run of "The
Idol's Kye" at the Tivoli comes to a close
this week and with it one of the record
performances at the popular little opera
house. "The Idol's Eye" was also one
of last year's record-breakers, but the
performance of this vear is much better
â¢than last year's and it has received
appreciation accordingly. Next Monday
night will see the first performance here
of "The Toymaker." by Edmond Audran.
the composer of "Olivette" and "The Mas
cot." The plot is bright and original and
the music tuneful.

The playgoing town is Investing largely
this week in "The Lottery of Love," run
by James Nelll and company at the Cali
fornia Theater. The smart Daly play is
smartlr acted and staged and is full of
wholesome, rollicking fun, with a not too
obtrusive moral comfortably tucked in be
tween the lines. The comedy will hold
the boards till Saturday evening, with a
bargain matinee this afternoon, and will
be followed by "Barbara Frietchie," one
of the prize plays in the company's reper
toire, on Sunday evening. "Barbara
Frietchie," which will be seen here for the
first time. Is by the popular playwright,
Clyde Fitch, and deals, of course, with
time of war.
time of war. The sale of reserved seats
for this piece will open at. the box office
this morning.
"Sag Harbor,'* James A. Herne's latest
play, is proving a solid attraction" at the
Columbia this week. It is one of the
pleasantest dramas that has been seen
here for some time, full of homely fun,
human nature and Ihe salt' sea air. No
great dramatic instinct has gone to its
making, but it will live when contem
porary plays a hundred times cleverer
shall be a long time dead. The company
presenting "Sag Harbor" is handsomely
adequate and the settings are most pic
turesque. The play will run for this and
next week and will give way to Henry
Miller and his company in "Gudgeons."

a warrant charging him with grand larceny
for stealing a valuable dog belonging to Joseph
Baruch, 900 Market street. He took the dog
with him to Honolulu, but did not bring It
back when he returned recently. ;
To avoid a scandal Police Judge Ca
baniss decided yesterday to hear the case
of Dora Fuhrlg, charged with murder in
connection with the . death of Mrs. Hen
ninger, although the other Judges had
refused to hear it. Judge Cabaniss set the
case for hearing to-morrow morning. Ex-
Judge Ferral, the accused woman's at

Donnelly Defends Himself.
Edward Donnelly had a hearing before
the Civil Service Commission yesterday
regarding his dismissal from the position
of inspector of street and sewer work un
der the Board of Public Works. City En
gineer Grunsky recommended Donnelly'3
dismissal on tho report of Assistants Con
nick and Jones on the ground of Incom
petency, and the consent of the commis
sion is necessary before the discharge can
be effected. Donnelly, who la 75 years of
age, spoke In his own defense, and the
matter was taken under advisement by
the commission.

said he used liquor spasmodically for
sanitary reasons and had innumerable
drinks daily. ' Â«/
. Drs. Wadsworth and "Wlndele were also
examined and they testified that â¢ Lewis
was sane. Dr. Wadsworth said he had
known Lewis for years and said the last
named was only irrational while under
tho Influence of liquor. Wlndele admitted
that he had never seen Lewis before May
Â«, and he had judged his mental condi
tion while he was talking with Judge
Hebbard. He admitted that the state- of
a man's mind varied and that to Judge
properly of one's condition he should be
placed under surveillance. It was hinted
that the object of finding Lewis sane was
to turn him loose in the belief that the
acoulttal of the Jury at the trial was
sufficient.
A number of witnesses were examined.
They all- testified that they believed
Lewis to be of unsound mind. They
were: John Landers, insurance agent;
Recorder Edmond Godchaux and two of
his assistants, Charles O'Malley Cosgrave
and Joseph P. Hayes; Clarence Gray,
Richard Wheeler, John T. Dare, Charles

The Commissioners examined Lewis on

GRAPE-NUTS.
NIGHT LUNCHEON.
Al! Eight if of the Bight Kind of
Food.
The difference brought about by the use
of well -selected food, as compared with
ordinary food, Is well shown in the experi-
ence of a girl attending high school and
boarding: herself.
She says: "My 'housekeeping* compelled
early rising and I used to become very
sleepy over my books. To keep awake I
resorted to the use of strong: coffee and
In a short time I began to have a dull,
stupid feeling. No appetite, but a feeling
of 'goneness.' I realized that I must cat
something or faint In the classroom. I
would wash down a little breakfast with
another cup of coffee.
"I began growing thin, pale and ner-
vous and made very unsatisfactory ad-
vancement in my studies.
Or.e day the rood wife of one of bur
Professors asked me If I felt well, as I
appeared so weak and nervous. .Between
my sobs I manag-ed to relate my woes.
She saw where the trouble lay, and ad-
vised me to leave off tea and coffee and
take ud Postum Food Coffee and Grape-
Jvuls Food.
'I followed her advice and found the
PoPtum a delicious beverape, and the
Grape-Nuts Just what I wanted. So my
breakfast consisted of a little fruit, a sau-
cer of Grape-ICuts, and a cup of Postum.
an ideal breakfast.
"It. at night, I felt the need cf some-
thing to eat before retiring, I ate a little
Grape-Nuts. ? '.-> Â¦ â¢* . -Â»Â«^
"My head grew clearer, my cheeks rosy, ;
and I gained so rapidly in health that all
ray acquaintances remarked upon it."
There. is a reason, for both Postum and
Grape-Nuts contain the elements from na-
ture's storehouse that the body uses to
rebuild the braJn and nerve centers
throughout. These wonderful food ele-
ments are presented in such a fascinating
form that users stick to them year after
year and very greatly to their benefit.

CHICAGO, May 8. â July wheat opened firm on
buying by houses with Continental connections
and because of " light Northwest receipts. A
cablegram reported severe weather in France
and declared considerable damage had been
done. Upon the announcement of this news
the foreign buying was supplemented by pur
chases for the local account, and- July, having
opened a shade lower to V4@Uc higher at 72%@
73c and sold off to -72%c on 'profit taking, ral
lied to 73tf@73%c. A later cablegram gave tha
Inference that the French damage reports had
been exaggerated. This left the trade to the
consideration of the absence of export demand
and the remarkable prospects of a bumper crop
In this country. Selling for the local account
met practically no demand and July gradually
worked oft on a very dull market to 72c and
closed weak lc under yesterday at 72<g72%c
May corn was not traded in to any extent, nor
was the July option, for that matter. May
closed Me lower at 52c. July closed a shade
' UI The sale "of 1,000,000 bushels of cash oats was
responsible for a bulge in that market and in
creased activity in the trade. Talk of unfa
vorable crop conditions was influential in ad
vancing prices. July- oats : closed %C higher at

WHEATâ The foreign markets came through
firmer. The foreigners, however, sold In the
American markets, though the great slump in
stocks in Wall street might have led to a good
deal of this selling. But against this there was
some buying on account of the reported damage
to the French crop, though this Is now looked

NEW YORK, May 8.â The stock market to
day offered the novel spectacle of a bear panic
and a bull- panic in progress side by side. The
bear panic in Northern Pacific was the impell
ing cause of the demoralized rush to cell other
stocks which was held In check for a time
after the astounding opening In Northern Pa
cific, but which gained almost panic force in
the late trading. Prices were not toppled
over . as a direct result of calling of loans
and forced liquidation, such as often culmi
nate a period of over speculation, although
there was a very general broadening of mar
srins and added severity in the scrutiny of
collateral, as was inevitable in the uneasy
conditions -prevailing, but it was evident that
the holders of long stock were holding their
stocks tenaciously and were waiting to be
actually forced out.' The punishment which
was being Inflicted on the shorts la Northern
Pacific was bo distressing an example as to
keep the bears in a timid frame of mind, and
thty hesitated to attack the market. The sup
port which came in on the opening dip helped
ro encourage the bulls and Intimidate the
bears, but the liquidation seemed so iÂ«.rge thai
the bears took courage and attacked the mar
ket a'ter midday and secured rich returns.
As the recession ill prices reached the 10
point line, the decline gathered force, show
ing the dislodging of long lines of long stock
by the wiping out of margins. A scrutiny of
a stock table will show the large number oÂ£
stocks whose declines extended to between 10
and 20 points with the resulting wiping out
of the ordinary margin. The chaotic condition
into which the market was thrown became
alarming in the afternoon, but the determined
support which developed and the resultant ral
lies which reached as much as 8 points In one
or two instances, took away the effect to a
partial extent of the disorderly drop in prices
and even Induced expressions from some of the
more confident bulls that the health of the
market was greatly improved as a result of
the day's happenings. The apparently unlim
ited buying orders which appeared in United
States Steel preferred when the decline had
reached 12 points and the resulting rally of
*'<i points, gave some of the bull speculators
the courage to claim that the day'e reaction
was really engineered by the powerful finan
cial interests which have been behind the
bull market throughout with a desire to shake
off weak followers and that lt was not out of
proportion to the unprecedented advance which
had preceded it. to the unequaled conditions
which at present obtain In this country and
the prodigous dimensions of the market and
of the forces which have been at work In it.
It Is the contrary view that collapses; such
as that of to-day do not tend to attract new
buying demand by such reasoning as. that
stocks are more attractive at lower prices.
Any one seeking to explain to-day's move
ment would have to go back over a period
of many weeks and for every suggestion of a
great financial combination or consolidation,
he will have to suppose a deep seated doubt
or apprehension such as was shown by the
disclosures di this morning in Northern Pa
cific. It came with a chilly shock to the spec
ulation that the country's great financial
forces which It was supposed were earnestly
working in accord to secure a community of
interests in the whole railroad world were in
fact arrayed against each other in measures
of bitter retaliation and antipathy. The Bur-
Irngton deal, on which such far-reaching con
clusions have been based by the speculators,
was seen to be In jeopardy. It was learned
that the level to which prices had attained
had induced Insiders, presumably best posted
on the value of their properties, to sell suffi
cient holdings to endanger their control. This
explanation of the competitive buying wnich
has induced some' of the recent sensational
advances, threw doubt upon the whole series
of rumors of plans for great consolidations
and transcontinental combinations among the
railroads. In other words, the broad intima
tion wax carried by the disclosures growing
out of the Northern Pacific development that
the recent great buying of stocks was for the
most part wholly speculative and without the
fsupposed bas!s in Inveetment purposes. Add
to this the growing constructions of the money
supply, continued Insatiable demands from the"
etock speculation. Inroads upon the narrow
bank surplus by the taking up of the revenue
surplus of the Government, a further ship
ment of gold to Europe to-day and growing
uneariness among money lenders as to the
stability of values of the securities which they
hold as collateral, and the delicacy of the po
sition Is eastry ecen. It Is not surprising,
therefore, that the shock of the Northern
Pacific episode coming upon this situation
toppled prices over. Northern Pacific's sky
rocket course this morning to 180, compared
with 143 at last night's close and 132 for the
London parity this morning. Is almost unpre
cedented for short time movements In the lo
â¢cal stock market. This stock was up to that
fisrure and back to the opening figure of I",
within three minutes. It went as low as 145
afterward and as high as 170, closing at 160.
The close corner into which the shorts were
crowded of course explained thin movement.

NEW YORK. May 8.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was much reduced on the stock mar
ket here to-day. The heaviness was general,
but Americans particularly suffered. Money,
rates tightened and trade reports are rather
disappointing. On the Continent everything is
dull. American shares were paralyzed by the
corner In Northern Pacific, which has made the
market afraid to deal in anything. This sen
eational movement with Its unprecedented pen
alties upon arbitrageurs who were caught short
on Northern Pacific has done the worst service
Imaginable to the London market, terrorizing
speculation and sowing the deepest distrust.
The highest price for the stock here was 141,
tbe close being at 132. though it was reported
here that the stock/' had gone to 200 in New
York.

"Conditions as to Coffee the past thirty days
have not been satisfactory to either buyers or

movement of the crops have stood by although
It is generally expected that the season of ar
rivals will be shorter and will end more sharply
under such conditions than heretofore. Other

slowly declined for all classes of Coffee. It Is
worthy of mention that everywhere the exces

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The wedding of Miss Mollie Thomas arid
Latham. McMullin was solemnized yester
day at noon at the home of the bride's
parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Thomas,
The conditions under which Kuhn. Loeb
& Co. were able to win their advantage
were that the Hill-Morgan interests in
Northern Pacific held about 400,000 shares
'of Northern Pacific as a permanent in
vestment, which was practically off the
market. In addition about 200,000 shares
were held! abroad an-J a good deal of this
passed to the Union Pacific interests.
This left virtually but 200,000 shares of the
X00.000 shares of common stock outstand
ing available in the New York market.
While there have been heavy sales of
Northern Pacific by insiders the stock
held for control has not been sold and U
la not likely that insiders went short of
the market, as has been intimated.
The corner in the stock was not looked
for by the serious buyers of Northern Pa
cific, who had practically accomplished
their purchases before Monday's sharp
rise. The pyrotechnics in the shares are
attributed to Keene, who, comprehending
what was actually gring on in the stock
and understanding the large short interest
tit speculators, went into the market and
tffected the corner.
Hill, it was authoritatively stated to
day, has not sold any or his Northern
Pacific slock. His large interest was ac
quired last summer around 50, when the
proek broke on the reduction of the com
mon dividend and the seemingly poor
traffic prospects resulting from the failure
â¢ f the spring wheat harvest. He said to
day: "I have not bought a share of
Northern Pacific in six months." In ref
erence to the reporteu differences between
the Harriman syndicate and the Morgan-
Hill interests he said: "That has been
magnified a thousand times."
The scattering fluctuations In stock
operations to-day were as follows: North
ern Pacific at opening. 155; between open
ing and neon. 170. ISO. 150, 146, 150, 147, 155,
158; after noon to close, 158, 163 167 170
IfiS. 167, 166. 160. '
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy at open-
Corner Was Not Expected.
Dealing with the relation of things in
trÂ» turincll of Wall street to-day, the
tinanciul writer of the Evening Post says:
The fundamental fact in the Northern Pa
cific situation to-day was that the Bur
lington deal is placed in jeopardy, as mat
ters stand at present. Union Pacific in
terests, which were alarmed at the danger
to their property lying in the Burlington's
control by the northern transcontinental
lines, have bought enough Northern Pa
cific stock to prevent the ratification of
the Burlington purchase* by the Northern
Pacific shareholders unless some agree
ment is made with them which will pro
tect their interests sufficiently. The cor
ner in the shares was unpremeditated.
That development resulted, It Is. said, from
Kc-ene's clever appreciation of the situa
tion in the etock, the legitimate demand
for which had heavily reduced the floating
supply. The corner's secondary aspect,
though the more spectacular one to the
public, is a movement of- far-reaching
consequences, possibly putting a stop to
the plans for the greatest of railroad
mergers, upsetting President Hill's auda
ciour. plan to have the Northern Pacific
control the Burlington's operations.
The policy of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. . has
been essentially one of self-protection, and
being now in a dominant position where
the balance cf power in the Western rail
way situation, so rudely disturbed by
Hill's Burlington deal, has been restored,
they will content themselves without
creating lasting hostilities among the
preat Western railroads, which would fol
low the abandonment of the Burlington
deal. There probably will now be made a
triangular arrangement, with the Union
Pac'flc sharing the control as well as the
Northern Pacific and Great Northern, un
d'T a modification of the burden of the
guarantee.
Reviewed by an Expert.
NEW YORK, May 8.â The stock market
was utterly demoralized at the opening
to-day by the developments in Northern
Pacific. What were rumors yesterday
became assertions of fact to-day, that the
Harriman interests, in retaliation for the
recent attempt to secure control of the
Union Pacific, had turned upon the Mor
pan-Hill interests and wrested from them
the control of the Northern Pacific The
competitive buying- which resulted caused
a virtual corner in the stock, to the dis
comfiture and panic of a very large Ehort
interest. The collateral consequences of
the open war thus disclosed between the
most powerful financial interests in the
country caused acute alarm among the
large operators long of the market The
Harriman syndicate, supposedly backed
by the Goulds and the Standard Oil in
terests, in bitter warfare with the Van
derbilt-Morgran-Hill combine, offered
alarming suggestions to the heated imagi
nation of speculators. While shorts were
bidding any prices for Northern Pacific,
speculators were unloading other stocKs (
ail through the lists. By some means j
Northern "Pacific had been forced 10* 4
points under last night's close here in the
J^ondon market this morning. ine
â¢opening sales here were of 2000 shares at
2o5, a rise of 11^4 over last night's close
here and of tPÂ£ over the morning's Lon
con price. On subsequent purchases of
blocks not exceeding 2009 shares the price
jumped 5 points at a time to ISO and then
fell back to 155. The price fluctuated vio
lently afterward between 155 and 145. The
"referred stock broke 9 points.

subject for. three weeks, the only Indica
tion that he was not recovering being af
forded by the postponing of his return
from Beaulieu.- He was to have been in
London -.to-day, but he has not yet left
his Rivera residence. .
. The attack of influenza before Easter
left him extremely enfeebled, and the
news from Beaulieu received in London
to-day shows that his debility is obsti
nately resisting all treatment, and has .
now -reached a grave point. The World
correspondent to-day asked Lord Hugh
Cecil, M. P., one of Lord Salisbury's sons,
ii it is true that the Premier is seriously
ill. He replied: Â¦ ,
"I know of: no ground for such a state-
The possibility of Lord Salisbury's re
tirement has - been freely canvassed in
political circles. .His death would not dis
solve the Ministry, but would lead to its
reconstruction. The World correspondent
hears that King" Edward would first ask
the Duke of Devonshire to take the Pre
miership, and if, he should refuse, would
then ask Balfour to accept it. Chamber
lain is now regarded as quite "out of the
running."

party, "has been effected by the payment
of $130,000 by the . Government to the/
French firm. . â¢ .â¢
Had the Government been able to settle
without considering the interests the
Carnegie Steel Company* it would have
saved $80,000. The original proposition
made by the Cruesot Company contem
plated the withdrawal of its suit. pro-,
vided the Government would pay it $oO,000.
The Carnegie - Company objected to the
term3 of the agreement, asserting that
its interests were not protected. The At-.
torney General rendered an opinion that*
its objection should be considered, and
this resulted in a failure of the negotia
tions. The Cruesot Company then ap
proached, the Carnegie Company. A com
promise, for $130,000 was effected, and the
Government has given its approval and
paid over the cash. This compromise

SEES RIVERSIDE
NEW YORK, May 8.â There was talk in
â¢the street of a great fight for control be
tween the Morgan-Hill interests on one
side and the Harnman-Kuhn-Loeb-btan
dard Oil people on the other, but' nothing
could be learned of It. In some parts of
the street the talk of a fight and of a great
clash between these powerful interests is
credited. In other parts it is ridiculed.
One story has it that over 100,000 shares
more than the actual capital stock of the
company have been bought by the oppos
ing syndicates, and that it is as yet un
certain where control Â¦ lies. However,
whatever the situation, several confer
ences were held to-day in regard to the
Northern Pacific . stock , situation, which
was participated in by James Stillman,
Kuhn Loeb & Co. and E. H. Harriman
on the one side and Daniel Lamont,
James J. Hill and Bacon^of J. P. Morgan
& Co. on the other. . "
Jt Is also understood that George F.
Baker and some representatives of the
, Vanderbilt interests were also present
during a portion of the last conference.
No decision was arrived at, but it. is un
derstood that Morgan had been appealed
to In a cable dispatch and that matters
were left in their present status pending
the receipt of a reply* from Morgan re
garding these dispatches.
Late in the evening it was learned that
after a conference between the represent
atives of the different Northern Pacific in
terests, held at the office of J. P.* Morgan
& Co., a prolonged conference was attend
ed by Harriman, Hill and Henry. W. Can
non .of , the Chase National Bank. It: is
understood that all efforts up to a late
hour to-night to arrive at an agreement
in Northern Pacific matters have failed.

MANY CHILDREN ARE ASSEMBLED
IN A FEVER-INFECTED BUILDING
ARTHUR WILHOIT and Joseph B.
Tucker, well-known men around
town .. and both j employed by
Shreve & Co., had a bloody battle
on Monday j night which was
pulled off according to the rules and reg
ulations controlling fistic encounters in
the ring. As a result both men were yes
terday confined to their beds, where they
nursed their bruises and recuperated
their strength. The young men employed
In the jewelry business of the city were
all interested yesterday over the affair.
An attempt was made to hush the story
up and the spectators of the fisht were
pledged to secrecy.
Such matters become common property,
though. Arthur Wilhoit was found In bed
and frankly and in a manly fashion ad
mitted that he had met Tucker in a glove
encounter and that they had fought sev
eral rounds till both had enough, in fact.
"I am sorry that the matter is roing to
. about business and the controversy was
I taken before the management at Shreve's.
, ' Wilhoit and Tucker are both vourig and
, hot tempered and befcre they had finished
' their talk the lie was yassed and resent
' ed: At the hour of closing Monday night
' there was a slight manifestation of what
i was to come. One made a pass at the
- other on the' sidewalks in front of 'the
- store where they are employed. Â¦ Tucker,
i so the story goes, suggested that that was
. no" place for men in their : position to ad
1 jjust their disagreements and proposed
> that they should find some place where "
. they would be shielded from the public .
Â¦ gaze. To this Wilhoit agreed and they â¢
, bent their steps toward the Ariel Boat
Clubhouse." V .
S, Some other of the employes of Shrevo &
. Co. were Invited- to go along to see fair
[ play and to the number of a baker's dozen
.' or more they followed on. The event was â¢
â¢ pulled off in the house of the Arlels ac
Â¦ cording to agreement. When the rnen'were
' ready it was . seen that there was not '
. much advantage in size or wright on
Â» either side. A referee and seconds were
the victor.* -There is, accordingly,' much
curiosity as to which of the- two will be
first- to get down to the store, and bets
are. being laid. .
The bakers connected with restaurants
which sell bread and have been declared
unfair walked out, but the general public
tvas not apparently affected thereby. The
cooks in several restaurants gave notice
;nd were told that their places would be
prcmtply supplied. Otherwise the strike
progressed harmoniously.
A large number cf carriage workers left.
the shops in which ..hey were employed,
'i he walkout was in accordance with the
8ction previously taken. The following
statement has been issued by the execu
tive committee of the Wagon and Car
riage Makers' Association:
The published statement in the Examiner of
May S purporting to give the facts in the con
troversy existing b*tw*en the Wag-on and Car
riage Makers' Association of San Francisco
and the labor unions represented in their
thops. does not give the facts as they exist, j
The members of this association have not
Â»>bj2cted from the besinniug to the demands
for nine hours' work, nor to the scale of
wages proposed. The only objection made by
the association is to the clause that provides
that none but members of the union in good
standing shall be employed In any of the car-,
ria'jje and wagon shops of this city. Â»
The association wishes to be plainly under
stood that it does not regard the demands
made by the labor unions as unreasonable so
far as hours and wages are concerned. There
is no feeling of antagonism or differences of
any kind existine between employe and em
ployer. The only objection is to the signing
of the clause requiring: thfe ajssotSation to em
ploy none but union labor and to dispense with
the services of any employes that may not be
members of the three unions Interested in the
present strike.

Many of the workmen expressed regret
at leaving their positions.
From the Cooks' and Waitesr' Alliance
the situation ls summarized as follows:
The Labor Council continues on the defen
sive. It etill seeks a conference with the em
ployers. This afternoon the secretary of the
Council was told by the Mayor that in con
ference with employers to whom he broached
the matter, tie was told they were not op
posed to a conference, but that the matter
rests in the hands of the Employers* Associa
tion and that its committee will act. The
answer will be given to-morow."
Information comes to the Labor Council
through different channels that the employing
bakers are refusing bread to union restaurants.
If this be the policy of the employers they
evidently do that with the deliberate purpose
of shutting oil the bread supply of the city.
It can hardly be expected that union bakers
will continue to bake for non-union restau
rants if they are not permitted to bake for
union restaurants. The Labor Council ls ex
hausting every effort to avert such a. calamity.
realizing fuUy whai. it would mean, for a city
like San Francisco where such a vast mass of
the people eat In restaurants and hotels to be
deprived of Its bread supply. Â»' . .

Both headquarters of the restaurant
proprietors and the Cooks' and Wtiters*
Alliance were closed early, the unusual
strain bcir.g too much for physical
strength. Some members of various
unions went out to do picket duty and re
lieve the tired waiters. Neither side was
l>repared to make a statement, although
The leaders of both expressed confidence
us to the outcome.
Strike conditions remain unchanged. It
â¢was expected that Mayor Phelan would
hr.ve representatives of those interested
on both sides of the controversy meet at
his office yesterday afternoon. Responses
to his invitations were not received in
sufficient time to permit the calling to
gether of the requisite number of repre
sentative people, so the matter remains in
abeyance. Just when the conference will
be held is a question that will be decided
by later conditions.
