Judged from the fact that the monu

there is no doubt that interest will bV

people of Tahiti itself, indulge In a celÂ»
bration that is on* of the most memorable)
that travelers can witness In any part of
the world. For the time being* the cele

of the place are largely of the condensed

wcrth $1 50 a pound, and can be profit

usual ; purity and brilliancy, and so-nu
merous and Â¦ easily obtained as â¢ to make
fortunes for these who have engaged in
the business of diving -for them. Al
most as fast as the pearls are gathered
in one place they grow in another, so
it is a saying with the clivers there that
the - sea is . their purse, from which all
T/ho need or' care may help themselves.
This work, too, is. of a sort that encour
ages individual efforts and does not lend
itself to the advancement of either in

Until late years Tahitlans took no not*

Time was of no value. They had all there
was and that was enough. Tha men were
always as young as they felt and the
women as ycunjr an they looked and no
one wanted their age set out before them
in black and white.
Much of the happlnesa of thÂ« residents
of Tahiti, -I think, depends upon the fact
that they have not been suddenly cut or?

/ I you like. You may call it a poÂ«e
\J You may throw all the mud yot
want" to at the motive, but the fac
Is still there that whatever the mo
tive, the recent results are big.
It was one of the tallied-about things
of the nineteenth century. Bigger for
tunes were made then than ever had beer
made before, and the possessors of therr
took to giving . large sections of there
away. They endowed libraries; thej
boosted the arts; they hunted out. strug
gling people and grave them education.
The last year of the century excelled
any that had ever gone before. Here is
a list which Rossiter Johnson,, editor oi
Appleton's Annual Cyclopedia, has fur
nished: . Â¦
According 1 to the scheme followed by
Mr. Johnson, the forthcoming number, of
the cyclopedia win contain an exhaustive
list of gifts aÂ«d bequests, each amount
ing to 55000 or over (where the value of
the donation is unknown it is so indicat
ed). This list excludes the ordinary de
nominational contributions for educa
tional, benevolent and religious purposes,
or State and municipal appropriations to
public and sectarian institutions and the
grants of Congress for various measures
of relief. For obvious reasons the multi
tudinous contributions to the India fam
ine fund, which amount to more than
1250,000, and to the Galveston flood suffer
ers, $1,253,710, have been omitted In detail,
but the fact is emphasized that even omit
ting these gifts and reckoned within the
limitations designated the number of gifts
and becuests shows a large Increase over
tfcat of 1S99. although the total, $47,500,000,
is r?v*r $15,000,009 less than the total for
tfce preceding year. Here Is a table show
ing 1 the amounts contributed during the
last eight years, calculated according to
the above noted restrictions:
2893 *29,C0O,0O0
3894 .-,..... 32,000,000
1895 , 32,800,000
3S96 , Â£7,000,000
1897 ,, 45.000,000
1S9S ,--' 3S.000.000
1899 62,750,000
XiOO ,,,...., 4i, 500,000
Total $314,050,000
In regard to the magnificent total con
tributed in 1899 Mr. Johnson wrote that it
"is without a doubt the largest amount
ever devoted to philanthropic purposes as
Individual offerings in any country in one
year." But without attempting to account
for the falling off in the total of 1900, it
xcay be deemed even more significant that
the' contributions were more numerous
than in 1S93, while It Is furthermore
worthy of comment that the gifts to edu
cation and culture have in a -large meas
ure signalized this augmentation in the
number of denors.
ThÂ« remarks on this Eubject made by
Frederic Harrison the other evenins at
the Authors' Club are pertinent at this
time, for their direct inspiration waÂ«s the
recent offer of Mr. Carnegie to provide
buildings for gixty-flve free libraries in
Greater New York at an estimated ex
penditure of $5,200,000. Mr. Harrison said:
"One thing that has particularly struck
me in this country has been the spirit of
philanthropy which is everywhere dis
played by your wealthy citizens. A re
markable instance of such munificence
has been made known within the last few
days. These great gifts to libraries,
schools and colleges have surprised me.
We have nothing like it in England. Why
we have it not would take too long to tell.
Our social system is different from ycurs.
There the heir of a wealthy house has to
provide the means through which his son,
or it may be his grandson, may take his
place in Parliament, or may become the
head of a noble line. Apparently an
American college has only to ask and
means are given It. Nobody in England
ever thinks of bestowing upon our col
leges the much-needed endowments which
your citizens so freely bestow upon yours.
I congratulate the people of the United
States in possessing such generous donors,
and I congratulate them also in possess
ing such a large and â¢well cared for read
ing public."
It is therefore not only the spirit of phi
lanthropy of certain wealthy Americans
that has made the last year of the century
conspicuous in .this respect but the fact
that the spirit has been more generally
displayed than in the previous year not
alone in charity and benevolence but in
those directions which help people 'to help
themselves by opening to them the means
of education and culture. Another thing
should be borne in mind. The year of the
Spanish-American war saw the contribu
tions to education and civic charity sink
to $38,000,000. Capital was otherwise em
ployed or inactive. Then came the reac
tion, the relief, and 1899 was made con
spicuous by a number of large gifts which
ran up the total of that year to an ex
traordinary amount. But the examples
then set have since been emulated in
many directions, and the fact that the
contributions last year to objects of edu
cation and culture were more numerous
than in" 1899 reveals a most healthful de
velopment of public spirit.
In the extracts which we have made
Â¦we have been obliged to confine ourselves
to the contributions made to non-sectar
ian institutions of learning, to schools, li
braries, colleges, academies, museums,
art collections and for similar objects.

Judge Conley of Madera County is
probably haying more fun out of the fad
than any one else on the Pacific Coast.
He makes a business of initiating people
and has become a ready, solicitor for the
Buffalo cause.' l He approaches- a' friend
with all the confidence of a life insurance
man and announces: *.; t

Eest authority points to v the members
of the Beefsteak Club as the instigators
of the Buffalo plot. This Â¦ information is
confirmed by Mr. George S. Adams, an
officer of the Alder Spears' Sons Co., 100
William street, New York City. Mr.
Adams is a well known New Yorker of
best social . standing, besides being highly
connected In larga business interests. He
is also a'Beefsteaker, and, while at the
Palace Hotel in this city a few weeks
ago took great "pleasure in. putting "his
acquaintances in touch with the Buffalo
end of the steak.
The Beefsteak Club was started as a
side issue of the Crescent Athletic Club
of New York, a' circle within a circle, in
cluding the same members in b'oth. Now,*
when the small j end of' their steak , began
to have a sameness about it, which palled
upon their would-be athletic tastes, they
turned to Buffalo tactics in order to whet
their appetites. They are all good fellows
and Buffaloes- and claim . credit for the
happy thought.
If San Francisco did not start the craze
she certainly has made good use of - the
"Buffalo" precedent since it came along.'
It was only. a;few weeks ago-that Miss
Josephine Gassmann appeared at . the Or
pheum in a vaudeville sketch, ' introduc
ing some of the blackest of pickaninnies".
"Are you a 'Buffalo?" she asked of one
all have "something: on the new member.
It's a Buffalo on him."
-The Judge took a day off a fortnight
ago and came to . San Francisco for the
sole purpose of initiating his friends. By
evening hie was very tired, said it was a
hard day's "work," but well worth while
and .that he had not handled so much
money in one day for a long time.
Judge Conley has his own way of in
spiring the applicants to offer large pieces
of silver for their initiation fees, which
leaves him large margins with which to
treat' the cheerful bystanders. When he
initiated . one of Â¦ San ' Francisco's best
known; citizens, : the new member ten
dered'him thrse nickels nearest at hand,
but these" were ' declined by the ambitious
Judge. . , .-;'..'

*^f RE you .*Â» Buffalo? If not, you must
f I become one immediately. That is,
I I if you care to be on the inside of
>â¢ I things. Who doesn't? To be a Buf
falo is the latest craze in New York
and other Eastern cities, and it is need
less to say that San Franciscans are also
tasting the sweets of this secret society.
They must take the bitter with the sweet,
however, for. simple as it seems to join
the universal herd of Buffaloes, there are
dark, unfathnmed caves of surprises just
beyond, on the ether side of initiation.
' "What does it mean to be a Buffalo?"
you ask of a friend when he suggests
that you become one of their number. He
abruptly tells you to never mind, but say
yes or no. Then he adds a few reassuring,
but somewhat ambiguous remarks and
you see at once that in order to under
stand them it would be necessary to Join
the society, for "mum" Is certainly the
watchword of your merciless friend (?)
"Well, I'm with you." is your brave de
cision. "Bring on your boiling oil. What
must I do to get in?"
Your informant leads you to believe
that it is the easiest thing In the world.
Initiation fee Is only 11 cents and, of
course, you're eligible. "Walt a moment
till I get a few witnesses."
You see him darting about the club
with an exultation in his heels that baf
fles description and yet you cannot help
wondering why he is so dead anxious to
have all of his friends on the scene of ac
tion. Then, too, what means that twinkle
In his eye?- Of course, you are not curi
ous. I'm not saying that, for curiosity Is
a. feminine heritage and entirely out of
your province, we are told, but in this
case you simply wish you knew.
When your friend returns with all the
dub fellows available on short notice you
venture another question, only to be told
that It is yours "not to reason why," and
you straightway determine to do and die
and be a Buffalo; for it would never do
to be Identified as a Mr. Fraid 'e Daresn't,
or to be numbered among the hopeless im
possibles.
You are now called upon in the pres
ence of this willing assembly to produce
the requisite 11 cents. Eleven dollars
would be nearer your size. It would be a
mistake to suppose that you, dear sir,
have anything smaller about you than a
golden X. At any rate you draw one
from your pocket, whereupon every man
in the crowd becomes convulsed with de
light. You fail to see the humor of the
situation, but your friends do not seem
to care for that; far from it. Their sole
Interest is In seating themselves comfort
ably, after which they proceed to order
champagne with a freedom that is start
ling, especially so as you are being told
that you are to "stand for everything,"
Including the laughs, which appear to be
coming your way; for it is one of the un
written laws of this modern order of
united Buffaloes that when a new-fledged
member pays his initiation fee, there shall
be no change forthcoming, but that the
difference between 11 cents and the coin
tendered by the applicant for membership
shall belong to the Buffalo who initiates
him, to be appropriated as the spirit
moves him in offering the happy onlookers
the cup that cheersâ and a good brand in
the bargain.
You decide to make the best of it, and
are planning the fun you can have initi
ating your untried friends when a toast
is offered by one of the merry members.
You clink your glass in true American
fashion and are about to drink when the
others call "Buffalo." The wise waiter
hastens to the spot like the veritable ad
juster of Insurance companies at an alarm
of fire. One friend explains that you have
Tiolated a rule of the order m drinking
with your right hand and can only rein
state yourself by' ordering another round
of drinks for the crowd, which you lose
no time in doing.
By this time you insist upon being en
lightened as to all the ins and outs. If
your initiating friend is at all' generous
he explains the several rules to you. If
ho omits one, however, the misfortune is
yours, for ignorance is no excuse for a
Buffalo. If you depart from one law of
the order and get caught at it by a fellow
Buffalo, you can only pay the penalty by.
supplying liquid refreshments for every
one present. â¢Â¦
Two Buffaloes must greet each other
by. shaking tho left hand, while you strike
a pugilistic attitude with the right, as
though threatening to land a fatal upper
cut on the opposite but erstwhile smiling
jaw. '. ; '\ : ': 'â¢?â¢'Â¦'.
One of the 'rules compels you to carry a
copper cent in a convenient pocket to pro
duce when called for by a fellow member.
Another calls for "sobriety and silence,"
but this is a rule in name only, for even
the most optimistic Buffaloes are striking
this out of the by-laws for the sake of
substituting "something easy."
To become a Calf is the highest degree
of the order, but do not be too ambitious,
for this happy state is rarely attained.' .
You learn that the sign of the Buffalo
Is the left hand over the left ear. Then
you master the distress signal and you
may start out for Â¦ new fields to conquer
for the fun of the Buffalo . cause. 'Â¦'â¢. .';':.-
As to the oritrin of this popular order
there is a difference of opinionâ a differ
ence as far as the east is from-the west;
for ' Boston is positive that the honor \ is
hers, wnile Los Angeles aspires | to ' the
same distinction. II is supposed by many
that the city of Buffalo started the craze,
but. this is erroneous, for several Eastern
cities were enjoying it before the prospec
tive expositionists even heard of the or
der.
Are You a "Buffalo?"
Have You Ever
Eaten Living
Honey Bottles ?
*jffi LATE traveler in New Mexico had
il\ for his dessert a unique dish. It
Ji VÂ» was like, yet unlike, so many am-
ber colored cherries, each, with a
most peculiar stem.
Doubtful, yet polite, he put one between
his teeth, and was surprised to find that
the little sac contained a honey-Ilka
liquid, .^i;'
"I . this Is your first acquaintance
with the honey ant," said his host. "He
flourishes with us, but does not get up to
your Northern climes. I believe Colorado
is his limit."
Then, in answer to the question on his
guest's face, he gave the following little
history:
"The honey ant Is a small red Insect.
living in rounded mounds, or, in some
cases, in low heaps extended over an area
from twenty to> thirty feet square. He is
most industrious, like others of the ant
family. Indeed, he' works day and night.
u His food is a sweet, syrupy fluid, gathered
from galls, those curious enlargements of
growth on trees and plants.
"With thi3 he fills his body, and as.
unlike his cousin the bee, he has not add
ed the making of vessels for food storage
to his other accomplishments, he supplies
the deficiency In a novel and interesting
manner. In other words, he uses for this
purpose the larger individuals of his own
species.
"The liquid food is forced into the crops
of these selected ones, each foraging trip
adding to the supply, until these crops,
which nature has covered with plates that
can spread apart as needs arises, have
reached their limit of distention.
"The living bottles, or receptacles, are
now practically helpless. They are not
neglected by "their companions, however.
A dark room is built for their accommo
dation, and here they cling to- the ceil
ing, receiving additions to their stores or
supplying: food ' for the hungry workers.
The people In this part of the country
esteem the honey ant a delicacy. We ase
it ' for our desert as you use grapes or
currants-"
bET a Paris modiste and a New York
figure get together and there is
fcomething doing.
Miss Redding says that the Paris
ians are delighted to get hold of an
American when it comes to dress-making.
This is not according to tradition: we
have been in thÂ« "way of supposing that
the Worths and Felixes thought there
â¢were no such women In the world as
those of their native land. She says no.
They consider that a good specimen of us
Is a treat to fit.
Miss Redding's figure is typically a New
Tork one. She is built with the big
physique that has come to be our national
standard; it suggests golf and wheeling
and healthy dressing. She is distinguished
from the Californian In being more slen
der; she is built more as Gibson draws his
Â¦women of the East. Given her, you can
see in the pictures what Paris art has ac
complished.
The big photo shows a rose pink silk
covered with point de Venise lace. It Is
really made in two parts, but the waist
line is concealed as much as possible to
give the effect of a princess gown. The
lace is drawn ur> to cover the belt, so that
at a short distance there seems to be no
belt at all.
Ruffle upon ruffle of pink chiffon fin
ishes the low neck, falling in billows over
the bodice and shoulders. The same chif
fon flounces the skirt and forms the "train.
It also edges the sleeves, falling as far as
the knuckles.
Miss Redding has a fad for what she
calls "tarantulas"; on this go;vn they are
made of black velvet ribbon, wired to
stand spiderwise on the left shoulder.
Another sprawls on the front of the skirt.
They are very stunning in their contrast
with the delicate pink.
The lilac silk is another spider-trimmed
gown. Its spiders are of velvet of the
same shade as the silk. Lilac chiffon
forms the flounces and ruffles on , the
l.odice.
The silver embroidery on this gown is
the most stunning thing about it. It
spreads in great starfish designs over the
front of the skirt; it trails around over,
the back: it forms the belt and borders
the pointed overskirt.
The hat worn with this costume is of
liliic shirred chiffon. Big puffs of the
chiffon trim it and its streamers are of
the same. I-ong sprays of lilac blossoms,
real enough to be dewy and fragrant, trail
about the left side of the hat, which is
mere bonnet than hat.
The black costume is of silk crepe,
tucked all over. The tucks are about a
half-inch in width. They run 'on the bias
in front, giving a dip effect where they
meet and so fulfilling the season's de
mands. The same bias tucks meet on the
bedice. Two pleatings of black chiffon
edge . the skirt.
Yoke and sleeves are of tucked chiffon,
with zigzag insertions of black chantilly.
The stock matches, and a pretty neck and
arms are given a chance to show them
selves r-t their best. .
The gown is severely simple in design
and would be dowdy on any but a good
figure.
The hat for it Is a Paris creation. It la
made of pleats of white illusion, sewed
round and, round, each pleat edged with a
tiny thread of gold. A broad black velvet
bow buckled with jet and two sweeping
black ostrich plumes complete the outside.
It is on the inside, the little tuck u
fiway nooks and half-seen places that tha
Parisian always lets himself loose. Un
derneath this hat is a poem. Folds of soft
two-toned silk face it: the tones are gold
and pink. Close against the folds lie three
roses, gold-of-ophir roses, that shade like
the silk between gold and pink.
The foulard is the perfect shade of blue
that you see once in a" while in an April
sky and not once In a thousand times on
a silk counter. It Is in one of the new
showy designs, black and white linked
spirals and very large ones. White chif
fon forms the flounces and borders the
short sleeves â they are only. elbow length.
The gown is made with an adiustable
guimpe of white lace. This gives high or
low neck, as you like. It is a very sensi
ble style to adopt for those of us who do
not employ a special car for our trunks.
From a knot of black velvet ribbon on
the bust hang long streamers of the same.
"Please notice that they are not finished
with spikes," says Miss Redding, in large
capitals.
A white folded chiffon hat completes the
costume. It is a hat with, a crown, for
crowns are with us once more. A wide
black velvet bow, a knot of chiffon ; a gold
buckle and pink rose3 trim it.
The costume which Miss Redding
brought back from Paris with the most
triumph is the brocade. The cause of her
triumph is that the gown was made .for
Helen of Montenegro, now Queen of Italy:
bo this is in reality a Queen's gown that
she Is wearinj.
There were six of these robes which Fe
lix had completed at the royal lady's or
der when she all of a sudden had to go
into mourning. This threw them back en
Felix's hands and He thereupon put them
on exhibition in the Paris Exposition as
examples of nineteenth century dress
making art.
One of the lot was labeled "La Soli
taire." Miss Redding's curiosity was ex
cited by this and she inquired the reason.
The explanation was that it was the only
one that was nowhere trimmed with black
velvet.
This fact took her fancy. She likes
things that are unique. So she negotiated
for the dress, found that it fitted her with
scarcely an alteration, and she brought it
away with her.
The silk ground Is covered -with a trail
ins design of what appear to be pink
bluebells. At intervals upon this ground
are hand-embroidered leaves. They are
woodbine leaves still in the intense green
that they wear in the early season. Light
green chiffon flounces the skirt and fin
ishes the sleeve. An odd thing is* the way
that tiny ban'd3 of it are shirred into
ropes, yards upon, yards, that are draped
across the bodice and wired into. a "spi
der" on the shoulder. Looped strings oC
pearls. cover the front of the bodice.
THE SUNDAY; '"CALL.
rest."

Stories. by Maurice Thompson.
Mr. Hornung: haa a direct, simple and
strong way of telling, a story that Is most
enjoyable. He gets his plot well in mind
and never wanders from it for an instant.
His descriptions are interesting and al
ways well chosen so that the reader finds
even the most trivial matter is there for a
'purpose; if not seen at once it will develop
at some later point in the story. The au
thor drops a hint : here and then another
there, but It is only when the. last page
haa been turned that the last link is
found. Altogether Mr. H.ornung's ; book
makes most delightful reading for. any one
who likes a well-sustained plot and -wishes
to meet characters full of life, spirit and
mental vigor. " (Published by ' Charles

The Shadow of a Man.
E. "W. Hnrnuns has come to be known as
a writer cf stories on Australian bu3h life,
although, his book last year. "Peccavi." la
a remarkably strong portraiture of an
Knplish clergyman and his effort to win
back public confidence, and "The Amateur
Cracksman" has a character that would
test the abilities of Sherlock Holmes to
the utmost. Both of these books show
that Mr. Hornung can write equally well
en subjects in no way related to life in the
bush, but the majority of his writings deal
with this phase of life, and so it has come
room, but the bird had flown. Some said that
the wicked farewell speech had been Adair's,
and Â«cEe ?ald not.
How it all happened, no one could tell, un
less it was a miracle.

The denouement comes at Nell's own
home, Â¦ which she manages to - reach In

sash, which Instantly yielded. â¢Â¦
Meantime the room had filled .with ccurtlers,
guards and gallants, who had rushed in, sword
and spear in hand, to guard the King.
As the glass shivered and flew wide, under
the ooint of Nell's blade, all eyes turned
toward her. and all blades quivered threaten
ingly in the air.
Buckingham was first to assend the steps in
pursuit. He was disarmed â more throueh the
superiority of Nell's position than through the
dexterity of her wrist.

screamed in supplication, with hands uplifted:
"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!"
The storm was stayed. All paused to hear
what the stranger-youth would say. Would
he apologize or would he surrender?
The suspense Â¦was but for a second, though
it seemed an eternity to Nell.
The open window was behind.
With a parting glance at the tremW.ng
blades Fhe turned quickly and with reckless
daring leaped the balcony. . \
"T hell with ye!" was wafted back in a

The air was alive with voices.

"Who, had he heard a murmur of . disap

have sealed In death the presumptuous lips,
which uttered it."
"She betrayed his confidence?" asked Ports
mouth, breathlessly.
"Betrayed â and worse!" gesticulated Nell,
Â¦with the visage of a madman. "A woman
base, without a spark of kindlinessâ an adven
turess ! This is the picture of that Eleanor
Gwyn! Where is a champion to take up the
gauntlet for such a Nell?"
As Quick as light the King threw back the
arras and came between them. The Duchess
eaw him and cried out in surprise. Nell did
not turnâ only caught a chair top to save her
eelf from falling.
"Here, thou defamer!" he called, his voice
husky with passion. "Thou base purveyor of
lies, answer meâ me, for those words! I am
Nell's champion! I'll force you to own your
slander a He!" ) > ..' >â¢â¢ -_.i
The King was terribly in earnest.
"The guard! The guard!" called Ports
mouth faintly, almost overcome by the scene.
In her passion that the King so revealed his
love for Nell, she quite forgot that Adair was
the bearer of her packet. . -Â¦'â¢>â¢
"I want no guard," commanded the King. N
"An insult to Nell Gwyn Is my cause alone."
Nell was in an elysium of ecstasy. ShÂ«
realized nothing, saw nothing.
"He loves me! He loves me!" her trembling
lips breathed only. "He'll fight for Nell."
. "Come: draw and defend yourself," angrily
cried the Kinr.
Portsmouth screamed and fell upon his arm.
It is doubtful what the result would other
was have been. True, Nell ofttimes had fenced
with the King and knew his' wrist, but she
â¢was no swordswoman now. Though she took
up In her delirium the King's challenge with
a wild cry, "Aye, draw and defend yourself;"
she realized nothing but his confession of love
for Nell.- ,
*-.r-oIME and again we have had novels

li successful plays of the present day
take their motif from some popular book.
But It Is something â¢ new for an author
to write a play and then when his drama
becomes an assured success to turn about
and bring it forth in novel form.
George C. Hazleton Jr. ; has just done
this with hiÂ« play "Nell Gwyn," and by
so doing has demonstrated that "no.veliz-
Ing" a play (if we may coin 1 the term for
the occasion) is Just as successful an ope
ration as dramatizing a novel.
He has given his book the alluring title
of "Mistress Nellâ A Merry Tale of a
Merry Time (Twixt Fact and Fancy)."
The work as it now stands conforms very
closely to the play, but is vastly superior
to any "acting version" that might have
been put en the market: for these "act
ing versions," when before you in cold
type without the aid of stage settings and
accessories, are dry seading at the best.
Mr. Hazleton has been . wise in not at
tempting to pad his story with long de
scriptions, but confines himself to the dia
logue pure and simple. His work holds
you simply by its interest In the charac
. ters and plot.
The direct rqotif of the book Is the
struggle between Nell and the Duchess of
Portsmouth for favor In the eyes of the
Merry Monarch, King Charles. Nell is
actuated by pure love for the King, while
the Duchess is endeavoring to put the
ruler's affection for herself to political
advantage.
The storr opens with a bit of life be
hind the scenes at the King's house in
the <3avs when all London was again be
ginning to enjoy the royal patronage of
the playhouses and the first seasons of
mirth and laughter after the iron rule of
Cromwell and h!s dark-browed adherents.
It is Dryden's night with "The Conquest
of Granada" on the boardsâ and a first
night at that. Here we are Introduced to
Nell and have an opportunity of witness
ing her kindness and generosity to the
loss fortunate friend^ of her early days,
Â¦when life was a struggle for herself. She
keeps the King and audience waiting
while she can sell the wares of a poor
orange girlâ for Nell had been an orange
girl in her day. And then later she gives
away the King's sift of a costly ring
that she ruay help the starving family
of an old violinist. Old Strings, the "fid
dler." is a prime character, and It is said
that the sympathetic words bestowed by
the old man on his violin sprang from the
author's tcr.der rejrard for his own sweet
tor.ed Gassard di Salo, which be loves so
to play.
Xext we see Nell high In regard of the
Kfng but consumed with jealousy of the
Duchess of Portsmouth. It !s Nell and
her orange girl tcaid, whom she had be
friended, and old Strings pitted against
the Duke of Buckingham and Portsmouth.
The Duke and Duchess are both anxious
to compromise Xell in the eyes of the
Merry Monarchâ the one that he may win
her for himself and the other that she
may find favor sufficient to obtain his sig
nature to treaties desired by l.ouis of
France.

and the triumnh of Nell and later the
trouble -between the King and the land

The strongest part of the book !s in the
climax at the ball of ' the Duchess of
Portsmouth, to which Nell has received
no invitation, but appears nevertheless In
the disguise of a young gallant â Beau
Adair. - Her ruse â¢ succeeds so perfectly
that she even ingratiates herself into the

As she was haetenlpe by the amm her quick

reflected. "Jealous cf Portsmouth; his eyes
follow her. Where are his vows to Nell? I! 11
flefame Nell's name, drag her fair honor in the
wire; bo. Charles, we'll test your manliness
and love."
She recroeeed the room quickly to Ports
mouth.
"Madame," she exclaimed, in crisp, nervous
tones, loud enoug-h for the King's ear, "I have
Â¦ been deceiving, lying to you. I -stood here,
praising, honoring Eleanor Gwynâ an apple
rotten to the core!"
"How now V ejaculated Charles, in an un
dertcne. BSRpwfB Â¦

A Traitor in London.
The Boer war, with its political features
and its picturesque incidents and charac
ters, presents, a wealth of material for ro
mancers. From it Fergus Hume takes the
material for his late.Â«=t book, "A Traitor
in London." The "traitor" is a Boer spy
and he is an admirably drawn villain, with
a depth of cunnint; and a wealth of ef
frontery Â¦ and. resourefv that ranks him
among the striking characters of fiction,
whom, we do not oasJIy forget. : His vil
lainy, however, is not shown so much in
his service of the Botrs as in the pursuit
of his own personal schemes. He is in
fatuated with a young lady who detests
him, but he .pursues her with persistent
assurance, of success, and in spite of ob
stacles that would appear to other men
quite insurmountable,' he several times
comes dangerously- near to succeeding.
She loves and marries an English captain
who is called at once to South Africa.
Soon after the hateu spy, being neatly
cornered Â¦ by another woman's wit, also
goes to the scene cf the war, and. here
we have some stirring Incidents of the
veldt- and some fins portrayals of Boer
character. Bya.cunning scheme the spy
has succeeded in inducing the y,oung lady
to go to South Africa; but by a neat coun
ter plot she falls into her husband's hands
instead of his* own as lie had planned.
Being high in authority with the Boers
he is able to abduct her while she ia at
the ' front, but a sturdy old Boer com
mander frustrates him again.
'The mystery of the story Is a murder
committed in England, and it is a mys
tery which puzzles the reader to the end,
ingeniously leading- the reader from one
guess to another and finally affording a
real surprise. (Published by F. M. Buckles

A powerful chapter from one of the
most remarkable of recorded human ex

story of his arrest, degradation and trans

added a portion of the diary kept by Drey
fuson the Island, for his wife, and refer
red to so often and so mysteriously In the
Rennes trial, but never made public.
A more Intense and convincing expres
sion of human agony than that found In
these fragments is Inconceivable. From
first to last It is evident that the sufferer
Is bewildered and maddened by what has
befallen him, and that all which keeps
him from Insanity of death Is his deter
mination to prove that his persecutors are
powerless to'overthrow what he calls the
"sovereignty of the soul." These dra
matic passages make it clear, too. that
Dreyfus was compelled to undergo on
Devils Isle every Ignominy and hardship
his jailers could devise, even to close con
finement in a hut, inclosed by palisades
and shut out from air and light, with
double Irons upon his legs throughout tho
night.
The book from which this remarkable
document is taken, containing the. story
*Â«X- Dreyfus' entire-five years of suffer

DO THIRTY PER CENT OF THE PERSONS WHO DIE KILL THEMSELVES ?
ACCORDING to a Chicago physician,
30 per cent of the people who die
kill themselves, and of this num-
ber few are classed as suicides.
"When a doctor cures .a patient," he
says, "the majority of his friends speak
of his strong constitution's pulling him
through. When the patient kills himself,
as thousands of them do,' the doctor gets
the blar^e."
This pnysician holds that non-observ
ance of a physician's directions is respon
sible In a score of ways for the fatal ter
mination of diseases. First of these is the
refusal of the patient to go to bed, as he
may be told to do, and last of them may
be the food or drink conveyed to the pa
tient under cover, just when he is on the
verge of convalescence. Between the two
are all sorts of possible tlnkerings and
tamperings with medicine, hygiene, and
dietary of the patient.
In the early stages of . so many dis
eases about all that a doctor can do is to
prescribe some-mild laxative' and send the
patient to bed, with instructions to eat
carefully and keep warm until time af
fords a more correct diagnosis. *
But there is a type of man and woman
who insls*3 that he always keeps going
till he drops. He doesn't believe in giving
up as long as he can stand and see." This

Ing themselves off as peaceable Indians,
proceed to the haciendas and secure work.
Then with the proceeds of their labor
they will purchase ammunition and return
to the hostile country. , Thus it will be
seen that the Indian problem here In So

mozo who serves my table, to-day may, a
"week hence, be lying in ambush for ma

Inquired.
"Not as a tribe," was the response. "Ex
perience has demonstrated that the- rural
districts will never be safe so long as tha
Yaquis are permitted to band themselves
together. There are always disturbing
elements among them whoso Influence
might at any time precipitate another
outbreak. The Yaqui 13 naturally of an
incendiary disposition, and it takes little
to arouse his hunger for destructlveness.
We have endeavored for years to rectify
his tendency to viclousness, but to no
'avail. "When the missionary priests who
went among them attempted to . preach
industry and peace their Influence with
the Indians was thenceforth irretrievably
lost. On the other hand, they would
listen with eagerness to the voice of an
insuirectory spirit. For this reason It
will be my future policy to keep the In
dians apart. Although obliged to- resort
in a measure, to deportation I am not In
favor of carrying It to extremes. "With
all his incorrigibleness, I still have hopes
for the Yaqui. and win yet eliminate his
vicious tendencies. " And of this, I assure
you," concluded the general, with unmis
takable sincerity In his tones, "notwith
standing the seeming harshness of the
measures I have been forced to employ In
effectually, crushing his' spirit of rebel
liousness, I have a far deeper Interest fn
the welfare of the Yaqui than any of
those who, without the least knowledge
of his true character, are seeking to up
hold and encourage him In his crusade
against civilization."
complish this It was necessary to deport
the prisoners,: as fast" as they were cap
tured, to parts of the republic sufficiently
remote to insure their inability to return.
It has been stated i that these captives
were sent to Yucatan, which is absurdly
erroneous, as that district is likewise in
fested .with rebellious, Indians. Such
Yaqui prisoners as I have thus far had
sent out of the country were mostly taken
to the State of Jalisco, one of the most
beautiful sections of Mexico, where re
newed endeavors are being made toward
their civilization.".
-."Howmany Indians do you estimate are
now on the warpath?" I asked.
"Tha't is difficult to determine," answer
ed the general. . "It is my.bellef, however,"
that their number has been reduced to not
more than 300, â¢ and these in turn are
broken up into numerous marauding
bands.. .â¢ Besides, their numbers fluctuate,
for at times members of the hostile fac
tion will leave the mountains, and, pass-
ductive. To render this land^ available for
agricultural purposes the Mexican Gov
ernment shortly afterwardgave an Amer-,
lean company a concession to. run a canal
from the Rio Yaqui into the country to
the southward, s under the condition that
itshould be so constructed as to furnish'
water. to such portions of the Indian lands
as could not otherwise be irrigated. 1 But
after the .work had progressed Â¦ to a. con
siderable ' extent the old spirit of rebel
liousness on the part , of .'the -Indians
against the encroachments of civilization
again prevailed, and without the slightest
warning they Â¦ fell i to murdering . every
whjte settler they could find in the region.
This act on the part. of the Yaquis was
the bitterest disappointment of my life,
for it destroyed : all my hopes of ever be
ing able to' resolve them. iht6 ..a, 'peaceful,
progressive community. It was then that
I felt compelled* to, recommend to the
Mexican Government that the tribe be en
tirely dismembered: To effectually . ac-
behalf of the Mexican Government I have
repeatedly madÂ«s special allotments of ag
ricultural land to these Indians, and fur
nished them with abundant corn and
wheat for planting purposes. The latter,
however, they would almost invariably
trade for mescal, their favorite liquor, or
else eat outright, with the result that
none of 'the land assigned to them has
been, to any extent, cultivated. Such a
thinir will never be when a Yaqui. will
come to me and say, 'I have cultivated all
the land you have given me and have r.ocd
of more,' but what he will receive all that
he may require. But such thriftiness is
entirely foreign to the Yaqui character,
and the most serious complaint" he has
ever raised is that the white settlers are
destroying his mpquite trees! It is these
mesquite trees that, constitute, to so great
an extent, his wilderness retreat, and they
cover the most fertile public lands in the
State."
"What specific trouble led to the pres
ent war?" I inquired. ,
â¢'It was the building of the great irri
gation canal which has its source in th-e
Hin Yaqui," stated the general. "At the
close of tno last Yaqui war, In 1897, the
Indians, w^ic allotted seven , pueb
los, representing &oi.:ctl'Â«T'p ' like .m:.

of this land, however, lies , too high

and was therefore comparatively unpro-
would in time create of him a valuable
factor in the permanent settlement of the
country. To this end he was allowed to
roam at will throughout the entire north
.west territory. If he chose to work for
others, the great haciendas offered him
no lack of employment, while if more
independently disposed! he was given the
preference 'of settling on whatever public
lands best suited his fancy. The result
was that a larger ' portion of the tribe
located themselves in the Rio Yaqui dis
trict, a remote but exceedingly fertile sec
tion in the southeastern part of the State.
Here they lived after the manner of the
average uncivilized Indian, depending on
game and the very least amount of corn
they could raise, for an existence. At
times, as necessity compelled it, some of
the tribe would proceed to other parts of
the State, where they would work for a
short while,' only to return again to their
wilderness retreat, there to live in idleness
so long as their, earnings would permit.
Repeated efforts were made by the Mexi
can.Goyernment-ttO'induce. the Indians to
cultivate rich lands of which they had
possessed themselves, but without avail.
And' not only dld-theyreSent every such
effort toward their own development, but
likewise'* opposed the improvement and
cultivation of. any part of the country in
their vicinity. Their opposition, moreover,
was not in the nature of mere protest, but
of: the massacre and robbery of all who
dared 'violate. their barbarous principles.
This violent perversity on the part of the
Ya'quls 'Is; the direct cause of alt the
bloody, warfare, that â¢_ for years has been
waged in the 'rural districts of Sonota.
"It has been stated that the Yaquis are
fighting for their lands,' which is ah error.
The. Yaquis think nothing. of the country
for what It will produce. It is the ad
vance of civilization th'ey are fighting. In
fluenced the Yacjuis, namely, a general
antipathy for civilization in its every
form. There are no two natures more
similar than these cf the Yaqui and the
Apache. It is not land for the purpose
cf cultivation that either have demanded,
but unlimited territory wherein they
might pursue their savage tendencies
without restraint. The United States
Government very early adopted the
theory that there was absolutely no de
pendence to be placed in an Apache so
long as the least freedom were allowed
him. Accordingly a persistent round-up
was inaugurated, and when taken alive
he was shut up on a closely guarded
reservation. But even this policy proved
ineffectual, and It was not until a large
percentage of the tribe were extermin
ated and the most refractory of its sur
viving members removed to far-away
Florida that peace and progress in the
former Apache country was established.
Had the Mexican Government been dis
posed, at the outstart, to adept like
measures in its dealings with the Yaquis
the tribe would long ago have been thor
oughly under control." -
"But," I interposed, "is it not true that
in the present war you are pursuing a
similar course with the Yaquis?"
"Precisely^," was the frank rejoinder.
"And it was in justification of this policy
that I have cited the precedent estab
lished by the United States Government.
The only difference In the two circum
stances lies in the lateness on our part
iti resorting to such drastic methods with
the Indians. For years we were impelled,
in the face of the most trying discourage
ments, to hope for a better solution of the
Yaqui' problem. Our policy was to accord
the Indians, from the outstart, every priv
ilege enjoyed by the average citizen of
Mexico, In the belief that such a course
"T EHMOSILLO. Mexico. April 25.â
I A "Has It ever been held that the
I I war policy of the United States
Government against the formerly
*z..:\ rebellious Apaches was inhuman
or unwarrantable?"
The Â¦question was substantially the first
utterance of General Luis E. Torres. Mili
tary Governor of the State of Sonora. in
the interview granted me on the subject
of Mexico's dealiCEE with the hostile Ya
quis of this section. And there was some
thing In the tones of the speaker that
suggested entire confidence in the ground
Â¦whereon, as a chief factor in the cam
paign against the Indians in question, his
principle* were based. It was this
"something" in the speech "and general
bearing of the distinguished Mexican that
from the beginning impressed me far
more than did his exalted rank and dig
nified presence. The absolute uniqueness,
however, of the quality referred to In a
man of his warlike calling for a time
rendered its exact nature indeterminable.
Then by degrees I came to interpret and
to appreciate it in the implicit trustful
ness that at once dominated his character
and reauired in others all that it gave.
In undertaking to investigate the actual
facts connected with the present Taqui
war, concerning- which during the two
years of It* progress so many conflicting
reports have been published. It had oc
curred to me that the first authority to
consult was the man under whose im
mediate supervision the campaign Is be
ing conducted. Hence, instead of making
application through the customary chan
nels for permission to enter the hostile
Taqui country, I proceeded direct to the
capital of Sonora and applied in person
to General Torres for the desired privi
lege, together with a statement of his own
convictions on the subject of the rebellion.
I found the general at his beautiful home
In the suburbs of Hermosillo, to which he
had just returned after an arduous trip
Into the heart of the Indian country. Not
withstanding hli Â«vldent physical exhaus
tion he received me with customary Mexi
can hospitality, assuring me that his
house was at my disposal bo long as I
chose to remain, an assurance which the
kindly look In his frank eyes in no sense
belied. And certainly no prospect could
have been more delightful than a pro
tracted sojourn in the languorous atmos
phere of his semi-tropical retreat. How
ever, there was no other way than to put
aside all such allurements, for the bilef
Interval I snent at Hermosillo was en
tirely occupied with the interview accord
ed me. -
"For fifteen years," continued the gen
eral, after the slight pause following upon
the incontrovertible question with which
he had prefixed his statement. "I have
been, in one capacity or another, Identi
fied with the task of civilizing the Ya

" 'Good, 1 said he, smiling. 'Come to my

" "By the by,' said the lieutenant as
he turned to go, 'how long would it take
you to make a good Filipino out of a
white man, or a white man out of a Fili

" 'All over, sir?' said I. - '
" 'Yes, put it that way,' said he, 'and so
he won't crock.'
" 'Maybe an hour,' said I, 'if I had the

" 'Get them and brinsr them with you

story of Wyllys Desmond, as nearly In

"Well, I had no trouble to get the
grease paints and brushes and things,
and I reported on time," said he, "and
'his Straps', looked over tha stuff and ask
ed a few questions that showed he wasn't
dead green, and before he got through
in came three other â¢ fellowsâ an infantry
sergeant named Prosky and two dough
boys named Smith and Evans â all little
chaps like me â no bigger than good sized
natives â and I began to twig one reason
why h'd lit on us. 'His Straps,' though,
was lanky and a head over . any nigger
I ever saw, and I got kind of chewing on
that a bit and wondering- whether he was
just going to send us off to get our necks
twisted, . while hp staid back and gave
orders and- took all the credit. and none
of the danger. The thought- gritted on
me good and hard, for I Â¦' knew mighty
well I couldn't make any Filipino that
would pass muster out of him. :
" 'Well,. boys,' he said, tvhen we all got
in, 'here are your kits. We're off!'â just
as sudden as that; and we took up the
knapsacks and bundles and weapons and
followed him. out and hiked â¢ along â¢ down
the street and out into the country and
through the lines, till a little after mid
night. Then we struck an empty Fili
pino shack, and we rolled in and went to
sleep. Only Mr. Farley sat up, near the
door, -with his sword and revolver on his
knees,' and watched out into the night.
He didn't seem a bit like a lie-down offl-.
cer, but how he ever expected to be cast
for a nigger was wriat stuck in my crop.
"He had , us up bright and early next
day, looking out over the jungle and. rice
swamps â mean country sure enough.

as we'd had breakfastâ no coffee, mind
you, or anything We'd have to cookâ'Des

"â¢Beg pardon, sir,' said I, 'but you

" 'Yes, . sir: I beg pardon,' . said I.
But I felt sour when I set to work, mak
ing sure we were to go it alone from, that
on. ,
"Meanwhile he was getting the cos

three striped and one amigo rig, and four

He. was getting under way in good old

himself up into the belief that he was

ccrporal, thought- he was getting left,
when he was 'really playing- to- the big
gest luck" that ever struck him. At first
the officer was going to keep us all out,
but, of course, Prcsky wouldn't have that,
. and said something about our wanting a
share of the honor, and how his Excel
lency would need a guard, because the
prisoner was a desperate man and had
killed two men before we took him: so
the officer looked nervously at Mr. Far

corporal, which pleased "everybody -else.
I think it was the talking about sharing
,of the honor that won us the new angel.

FEEQUZNTLY history is turned
into fiction â there is absolutely
nothing- new or astonishing
about that. But for fiction to be
turned into history is a thing practi
cally unheard of.
When in December, 1899, Duffield
Osborne wrote a purely fiction story
for Harpsr's Weekly on the capture
ct Aguinaldo he could not possibly
have known that what he. wrote would
come true just one year and three
months later â and tru? in very fact
almost to the letter of his most mi
nbte descriptions.
Fun ston captured the real Aguin
aldo by practically the same ruse that
was enployed by the lisut:nant to
take prisoner the fictional Aguinaldo
in Mr. DuiScld's story.
On December 23, 1899, Mr. Duf
field's story -was published in Â¦ Har
per's Weekly and a year and thrcs
months later to the very day, March
Â£3, 1901, The Call printed" the first
telegraphic news of the capture of
Aguinaldo by Funston.
It will bs noted that the plan cf
the capture as published at that tiras
could â¢well bÂ« taken as a synopsis of
the story which had appeared over a
7ear btfore.
Here is the history taken literally
from This Call of March 23. Bead
this and then read the fiction which
Â¦was later to become fact.
Plan of the Captmre,
General Funstcn's plans, as outlined in a dis
patch from Manila a few days agt>, were to
make the trip over the Isabella Mountains to
Aguinaldo's hiding place, accompanied by Sur
reon Major Harris, Captain Newton of the
Thirty-fourth Infantry, Lieutenant Admire of
the Twenty -secopd Infantry, Lieutenant Mitch
ell of the Fortieth Infantry, six veteran scouts
and a company of native scouts, all picked
men. They were to be landed by the grunboat
VickEburs on a remote beach north of Baler,
and were to proceed overland, guided by a
former officer of Aguinaldo, who had betrayed
to Funston the Filipino leader's abode.
To deceive the enemy it was arranged that
Aeninaldo'ii representative, who had griven the
Information to the Americans, should lead the
native scouts, they to assume the . character of
insurgents Â«itil loyal to the rebel cause.
' ThÂ£>' were to make it appear that they had
captured General Punston and ether American
of6cÂ«rÂ» of hich rank and were taking- them
intft the camp of the insurgent chief to be de
li vereQ as prisoners of war.
Then was to come the daring part of the
plan. The prisoners were to throw aside- their
assumed character and metamorphose them
selves from prisoners to captors, seize Agui
naldo, beat down any opposition that might
show Itself and hold their prisoners, no matter
bow great the peril or how great the forces of
the enemy. ;-'iV -
To carry out the programme required a. long
march into the interior and never-ceasing cau
tion to guard against treachery. The troope in
New Vlzc^Lya and New Eeija and the gunboats
Vicksburff and Albany were ordered to co-op
erate with tlje captuHng- party.
The ntws of Aguinaldo's capture indicates
clearly that the plans of General Punston were
carried out successfully.

consider our Information most accurate
and complete. A few, a very few, know
the truth and the whole truth; the rest
of us only think we do, and argue and
praise and condemn our statesmen and
soldiers just as if we were not supremely
ignorant of thÂ« vital facts and the argu
ments that have dictated their actions.
Often, in the history of the world, the
truth has been such that it can never
be revealed, even to the most remote pos
terity; sometimes, as in the case of the
much disputed Venezuela message, the
Etory may leak out at some not very dis
tant time; while again, as in the present
â¢ Instance, all may be safely made public, 1
. and is bound to be when the reasons
which dictated the policy of concealment
have ceased to exist. The rebellion in
Luzon is practically over, Aguinaldo is
"a prisoner," and I am merely telling a
story -which another might tell to-morrow
. or the next day or the next. ' â¢
We all applauded when Wheaton set
Â¦ eail for the Gulf of IJngayen; we ap
plauded his successful landing on Novem
ber 7, and his advance and pursuit of the
strangely evanescent Agulnaldo. Perhaps
some of us wondered at the trifling re
sistance he encountered and at the sud
den melting- away of an organized rebel
lion which had been supposed to domi
nate nine-tenths of the Island. How many
ol us, though, noted, much less recall, cer
tain apparently unimportant cablegrams,
already dusty in the files of the newspa
per offices? For instance:
"Special Cable Dispatch., Manila, Oct.
24.â Some anxiety is felt concerning the
fate of Lieutenant Farley of the Marine
Corps and four privates. Lieutenant Far
lev volunteered to lead a scouting party,
Â¦which started on October 16, since when
no news of him has been received."
"Special Cable Dispatch, Manila," Oct.
25.â There is still no news of Lieutenant
Karley. and the gravest apprehension is
felt at headquarters. It is understood
that the service upon which he volun
teered was one of great difficulty and
peril, and entirely of his own suggestion.
General Otis had little hope of a success
ful outcome, and only yielded to Farley's
eagerness and confidence. Yesterday's ca
ble was in error stating that the missing
officer was of the Marine Corps. He is
John B. Farley, first lieutenant Twentieth
Infantry. The men with him are Ser
geant Michael Prosky and Privates T.
Smith and Evans of Twentieth Infantry
and Corporal Wyllys Desmond of the Ma
rine Corps. All were specially selected by.
Farley for the service."
"Special Cable Dispatch, Manila, . Oct.
27.â Lieutenant Farley and his men have
been practically given up. Wylly3 Des
mond may be remembered by New York
ers as a comedian of some ability, who
left the Eighteenth Street Theater Com
pany and enlisted, in a fit of disgust, be
cause his short stature stood in the way
of his ambition to take serious parts.
Prosky is a Pole, and is noted in the army
for his ability as a linguist. He speaks
TagaJog- like a. native."
So much for these; and then there was
a private message that was sent October
28 to lieutenant Farley's mother. Of
course, you are familiar with the cable
prams, along the last of October and the
first of November, which told of the sud
den preparations for Wheaton's expedi
tion, but, naturally, you are not familiar
Â¦with a letter received a few days since
by a friend of Wyllys Desmond, which
reads as follows: â¢
"MANILA, Oct. 15, 1839.
"Dear Tim: Well, I've volunteered for
Bome sort of wild scrape. Things have
been pretty slow of late, and this may
give me something to write about, if I
don't go under. It was like this:
"I was smoking my pipe by the bar
. racks grate, when : I saw. Captain Murray
of the corps come along with another, offi
cer, *uid I noted that the duck was a first
lieutenant of infantry, and that he looked
sorer all the time. â --.-Â¦ â¢..- *Â¦ \
" 'Now, boys,' said he, 'now that Des
mond's made you the right thing and
you're dressed and armed, just tuck these
revolvers under your clothes. Perhaps
you'll need them and perhaps you .won't,
but I'm afraid your bolo practice isn't up
to champion form, if we should have to
light." " 'â¢: . Â¦ :.;
Â¦ "So we took the revolvers and a hand
ful of cartridges apiece, and I couldn't
help thinking what a decent spoken man
he was for a skulker. 'â¢
" "Tenshun!" said he then, and we
straightened up. 'And, now, my men, I'm
Lieutenant Farley, U. S. A., and your
prisoner. You caught me outside the lines
and tied my hands behind my back, tak
ing my sword and revolver, and you're
carrying me straight to General Agulnal
doâsee?' â¢ . â¢
"He stopped a minute to let that sink
in, for we couldn|t open our ears quite as
wide as we could our. mouths and eyes.
" 'Desmond's an amigo,' he went on,
'and he and Smith, and Evans don't be
long to the same tribe "as any one wÂ«
- '* . Â¦Â¦Â¦'.. ' ; Â¦', 'â¢
just like any other* lieutenant of lnfan-j
try, except that he had a square cut to
his jaw and that his mouth shut tight
when he wasn't talking. . - ;Â¦ v
" 'This is the fellow," I heard the cap
tain saying (meaning me). 'Take him if
you want him and good riddance.'
"Then the strange' lieutenant , asked
something else in a low voice, and the
Cap. said: V; ; Â¦. .
" 'Sandy enoughâ oh, yes! There'snoth
ing the matter with his sand.'
"With that Lieutenant Farleyâ for
that's who it wasâ walked up to me and
I stood up and saluted, and he looked me
over good and careful, and said:
" 'They tell me you've been on the stage,,
my man. 1 . ;
; " 'Â¥es, sir,' said I; 'eight years, leading
comedy parts."
" 'Understand all about make-ups?' said
he.
" 'Yes, sir; all there is to know,' said I.
" 'Do you want to volunteer for a dan
gerous service â about a one to three
chance, and worth it?' said he.
"'Yes, sir,' said' I, without thinking. :

other fellows should fall back so they
couldn't spy into the windows or hear
what went on, all the while rubbing rfe
in good and hard that the fewer people
who got on to the game the fewer chances
there would be for outside claims, it
went, too; and for two cents* worth more
of such talk I believe the general would
have sent every jack Tag out of the wnoie
inclosure. -Â¦'Â¦.,'. .~.
"Well, the general led the way, with
Prosky whispering' mighty confidential,
what I learned later was a tip that we
were to say that -we were his men, whom
he'd sent to catch this very prisoner, hav-,
ing knowledge of his staying out. late of
nights, and promising, to look out for us,
which he could do much .better than we
could, with the big pull he'd have after
such a service. He'd have looked after
us all right; no doubt of that. But Prosky
was bright enough to fall into the scheme,
using it, as I've said, to get the guard or
dered away. -Â¦-â¢â¢.Â¦."â¢'. :
"The upshot of It all was that, after
one or two questions and answers ana
some delay, we slid into - the door and
shut it behind Â¦ us, and were shown into
a room where Aguinaldo himself was sit
ting behind a table looking dignified; and
there wasn't another genuine Filipino
within fifty yards, barring the general
and Aguinaldo' s secretary, who stood at
the end of the table. Everybody stoodâ
the general told us it was etiquetteâ in tne
presence of the President.
"There he was, sir, at lastâ ratty eyeÂ»,
pompadour hair and all. just like- the pic
turesâand he made a -sort of motion and
said something soft, and we pushed Mr.
Fsrley forward. Of course,; the rest
crowded up. with him, he being sucn a
particularly dangerous prisoner, and Agui
naldo frowned. You see. we'd pulled our
. bolosâ partly to salute with and partly to
keep the prisoner in order.
"Aguinaldo began by firing two or
three questions at himâ first in Spanisn,
and, when he shook his head at that, in
a, sort of pidgin English he'd picked up
in Hor.gkor.g- and on our ships. J. nere
didn't seem to be any call for our play
ing off longer, though. We might have
been interrupted or suspected or some
thing and. as it was, we were good and
well bunched, in easy reach of one an
other's 'throats. Agulnaldo, of. course,
was across the table, but that was only
a good jump for an active man. me
whole .thing looked so easy that I found
Â¦ myself beginning to grow very cool,
1 which, -I'll admit,. I hadn't been before
only I wished the . lieutenant would give
thf* si**" 1 " 1 **! * '
"Pretty soon Agu!naldo began- to get
excited and leaned forward and then Mr.
Farley leaned forward too, as if to make
him Â£ understand, he having Just mum
bled two or three things the. President
couldn't quite get. It happened pretty
quickly then. You see. the cords .on Mr.
Farley's wrists were almost cut througn,
and they came off like thread; and he
had the little monkey over the table by
his yeLow throat, sputtering and trying
to get loose, which* didn't quite go. -
"About the same minute Smith and Ev
ans, who had been standing back with
drawn boles, cut down the secretary and
general, and I ran around the table to
help the lieutenant with Agulnaldo. Then
Mr Farley jumped over," and we had him
down and the chloroform under his nose
just as we had planned it out.
"Smith and Evans had finished up the
other two by this time, which had to be
done. We couldn't afford to take any
chances, and, anyhow I don't believe
either of them would ever have got up
from the first, strokes. Bolos are made
to cut for keeps. Altogether the job was
finished dead easy, and, barring the
scuffle, there was no more noise about it
than passing the time of day with a
friend on the Rialto. The secretary's
screech was all that could have carried
outside, and Prosky ran to the door,
ready to explain how the Illustrious Presi
dent was merely trying to induce the de
testable itrisoner to answer a few ques
tions. No one came to inquire, though.
If they heard it they like enough took the
other :>art for granted.
"There we were, then, with two dead
natives and a very quiet and orderly
Senor Presidente of the Filipino republic
on our hands, and now it was my time to
take the center of the stage again. Aguin
nldo and the lieutenant -were just to
change parts, that was all. Prosky stood
at the outer door, ready to answer ques
tions; but, Lord bless you! I don't be
lieve a blooming one of the gang would
have dared to come near the house after
what they had been told. Discipline don't
amount to much among those fellows, so
far as the style end of It goes, but if a
chap don't do as he is told in certain re-,
spects something drops on his neck quick
and hard.
"That's why I wasn't Interrupted except
by my own thoughts, and at the end of
an hour or thereabouts the lieutenant was
a pretty good Filipino, barring his height,
"and Aguinaldo would pass in the dark Â¦well
enough for a lieutenant of United States
infantry. Mr. Farley's clothes were on
"Aguinaldo, and the secretary's covered 'Â¦
as much of Mr. Farley as they could.
That was the best we could do for him,
and I admit that his feet and inches wor
ried me. I will say, though, that I never
saw a man quite so sharp to look out for
everything.
" 'Now, then A said he, *up with him and
out we go. I'll get well under his weight,
so as to have good reason for stooping.
We're carrying out the prisoner, sergeant,
under the President's orders, and the
President is not to be disturbed.'
"With that we started, locking- the In
ner door and taking. the key. We didn't
dare lock the outer door for fear some
one might see us and get wind of some
THE SUNDAY CALL.
funny business, though every door count
ed now, every minute of delay, for there
wasn't much question as to what would
happen if we were caught.
'/Through the courtyard and past the
guards we slid along, with our eye3 on
the ground and our load shifted so that
the head and face hung down. A good
light or even a close squint in the dark
would have done for us, but we didn't
run up against either.
"Prosky spoke short," and the guard,
who'd- started to crowd up when we cams
out, fell back into the shadows quickly.
Prosky's business was fine, and it didn't
take the biggest fool of them long to see
that the President had been graciously
pleased to do the prisoner in his own way
and far his own reasons, and that it
wouldn't be healthy to pry.
"All along the street and toward the
outposts It was the same thing. People
were just as quick to get out of our way
as we were to want them to. I suppose
Mr. Farley had reasoned it all .out in that
way, and it was reasonable enough when
you thought about it. What looked like
the biggest risks just worked in our fa
vor. iror instance, we didn't have to
stop and get tangled up in risky expla
nations, because I don't believe we'd been
in their lines half an hour before every
body knew we were there and that we'a
brought in a prisoner, and they dicTn't
seem a bit surprised when they saw us
bringing him out on the horizontal. Even
the secretary's bloody clothes on Mr. Far
ley helped the thing along. If the most
gracious President had ordered tne vil
lain's throat cut, what more natural KTan
that the valiant patriots who did the act
and carried out the corpse should be a
trifle bloody? So it was easy all the way
to the outpost where we came in.
"Maybe the natives at the outpost didn't
grin when they saw us coming, and the
corporal's was the broadest of all. Ha
drew his finger across his throat and
nodded cheerfully, and Prosky nodded
back and repeated the gesture.
" 'Carrajo!' exclaimed the corporal. 'Will
you return when you have buried him?'
" 'Not till we catch another,* laughed
Prosky. â¢
"The corporal bowed in respectful ad
miration and envy, and Mr. Farley threw
him three or four dollars Mex.
"'So that all valiant 'patriots may re
joice in our reward,' says Prosky. like a.
melodrama hero, and we passed through,
the lines and out into the jungle.
"It was quiet out in the jungleâ quieter
even than in the rebel lines, and yet
every second since we left the stockade
around AguinaMo's quarters I'd been;
hearing the howl that was sure to come
when the natives got on to our game.
It hadn't come, really, and unless luck
bucked up hard against our plans, it
wouldn't come for some hours â perhaps
not until morning; but I heard it, all 'the
same, right along. Â«
"Meanwhile we pushed on faster, but
it was slow enough work at best with a
dope on our hands. He- was beginning to
come out of it now, and we tied his arms
behind his back and got a gag ready to
stop him up with, in ease we ran across
Any of his crowd. I think it was the biff
stake we were playing for, and the near
we were to winning it, that gave me cold
feet, more than the danger, because that
had been there . all along and I hadn't
turned a hair.
"We were making for the west coast
now â the nearest point on it â and were
making hard. Mr. Farley told us how
three or four of. the little gunboats were
to be sprinkled along: at different points
to pick us up if we got that far. and that
it behooved ua to get. Three days* march
it was, easy, supposing we couldn't steal
horses, which was worse than doubtful.
"Agulnaldo had come around pretty
well by this time, and we let him walk,
which made traveling lighter. His gag
had been fitted in kindly but firmly, and
a rope tied around his neck in case he
balked any. Mr. Farley and Prosky hiked
along on either side with drawn revol
vers, and told him how he'd be shot full
of holes before he was rescued, but that
if we got him to Manila all safe he'd only
be comfortably marooned on a living sal
ary. I guess he believed the first part
fast enough, if he didn't the second, so
he just rolled his eyes.
"As I was saying, I think those three
days were the worst, and we didn't have
any trouble, either, right down to Ue
last minute, till we struck the beach all
of a sudden, with the jungle running
almost down to it, and the little Juanita J
lying- out about half a mile and the flag
fluttering on her.
"Meanwhile they couldn't have fotmd:
out about us back at Tarlac until morn
ing. Then they moved fast enough, no
doubt: but" we hadn't heard a sound ex
cept the yelling in my ears, and we hadn't
seen a soul except half a dozen natives
twice, and Prosky had gone ahead and
explained that we were taking- along a
prisoner to be disposed of secretly, by theN
orders of his Excellency. That was
enough. It looked all right at long range,
and they seemed to understand thnt it*
wouldn't be just the thing to investigata
such matters too closely.
"Now at last we were on the beach and
everything had gone just like clockwÂ«5rk,
end the signals were made and a little
boat was dancing In over the surf. The
lieutenant and I and Agulnaldo were
down by the water, and the rest lay back
along- the edge of the jungle â just inside,
you understand â to hold off possible inter
ference at the last moment. Heaven
knows why I felt sure it would come, but
I did. and just abcut the moment the boat
shot through the breakers and crunched
on the beach we heard a gun go off behind
.us.
"We had Agulnaldo in the boat, lying
down along- the bottom, in about two
shakes, and the lieutenant and I stood
in the water at each side to push off.
only neither pushed, and we just stood
looking at each other and- back at the
brush.
"Nobody had broken through right be
hind us. But away up the beach, in each
direction, we could see the rebels running
out and shooting-, and the bullets began
to splash, and pretty. soon the Juanita
joined In with her one-pounders.
"You see, it was like this, and Mr. Far
ley; and I understood it fast enough. It
was our business to get into that boat
and get our prisoner out â quick. We botrt
knew well enough what we ought to do,
but it was leaving the boys; in the bush
that choked the order down in his throat,
and we knew those boys wouldn't come
out â were just going- to> hold there till
they went under and give us time to get
away. That was their business and they
were doing It. *
"By this time the one-pounders and the
Colts had cleared the beach. We knew
the rebels were crawling- down along the
edge of the jungle, though, and their shots
kept cropping in occasionally.
"All of a sudden the lieutenant got It In
the shoulder and nearly toppled over,
and they pulled him Into the boat, and
the ensign was. just saying. 'Now. then!*
when the jungle in front broke loose. You
see, they saw us getting off with the
game, and they saw Mr. Farley drop, and
they couldn't stand it any logger. Colts
or no Colts, so they'd just rushed Prosky
and the others, and Prosky and Smith
came out with them, laying about like
mad, and the Colts and the one-pounder
turned on the muss, and the men In the
boat let go. You â¢ see. there wasn't one
chance in twenty for our three boys, any
how, and that rush had to be stopped.
"It was. The rebels couldn't stand it.
Prosky was down when they went back,
but Smith picked him up and ran fast to
the boat. They had a dozen or so gashes
and holes between i them. But we were
off at last, pulling like mad, and the Juan
ita pumping metal over us Into* the bush,
and the Mausers and Remingtons splash
ing up the water all around.
"That's about all. You know now what -
was left of us got back to Manila. Mr.
Farley'll be all right, they say, in two or
three weeks, Â¦ and Smith is going 1 to pull
through, and, maybe Prosky. Poor Evan3
dropped In the jungle just before the reb
els made their break for the boat, . and
Smith says he was Â¦ dead -. fast enough.

seemed to me about three years before
we heard the nigger for 'Who goes .there?'
"That was where Prosky got his cue. â¢
" 'Friends, says he. (This was the gist
of the talk. Prosky^gave it to me later,
and it sounded as much like as anything
else.)
" 'What's the countersign?' said the sen
tinel. ~ Â¦
" 'This is my countersign,' says Prosky,
throwing out his chest and flourishing his
hand toward Mr. Farley. 'Listen ! We
have- come many Gays, many mlies, not
resting, not sleeping, scarcely eating, and
you delay us now! It is a prisoner of
rankâ a great general. He is oursâ ours.
We, the valiant ones, took him from Ma
nila. It is most/necessary that, we carrv
him before .the illustrious - President at
once â and secretly. No one must know of
the capture firstâ it- would be death; and
when the. most illustrious President and
general shall examine him, it is he who
shall say what shall.be announced, and
to whom, and when. Is it permitted to
pass?' y -.
"But the idiot sentry mumbled some
thing more about the countersign, and
Prosky threw some good indignation. '
" 'Did I not tell you how, coming- from
Manila, night and day, weâ could not

ky's a Tagal, and it's his talk that car
ries us throusrh or leaves us f ruit . for
trees. I talk English, which none of you
understand; but you want to obey my
orders just the same as if you did,' and
Mr. Farley kind of grinned.
"I didn't twisr what he was driving at
yet, but I saw now that he was going
with us all right, and I kicked myself
hard for the rough thoughts I'd had about
him.
" 'I think that's all I've got to say now,'
says he, looking sideways, as if he was
casting it up in his mind. 'We're going
â¢straight to Tarlac, where, I understand,
Aguinaldo is. If he's not there, .we're
going on till we find him- Mind'.you, I'm
an important prisoner, whom it is ..abso
lutely necessary for him to see Â¦ and ex
amine at the , very earliest opportunity;
so you've brought me airthe way fromâ
Manila: Naturally, you don't know any
passwords or- countersigns. The story
hangs together all right, and it ought to
go. If it doesn'tâ well, I'll give orders as
if I was asking questions or favors or
something, and we'll do the best we can.'
"We'd gotten over our surprise by this
time and Â¦were grinning like so many
Chessy cats â part because the thing
struck us as funny and part to hide our
excitement; for we could see fast enough
that 'his Straps' had something big up
his sleeve. Prosky was solemn, though,
not being a born American, and he went
to work in a matter of fact way to tie
the prisoner's hands behind his back and
gather In his sword and revolver. Of
course, Mr. Farley had another gun under
his clothes all right. Then we struck off
through the jungle and made a day of it.
"Well, sir, the next days were just jun
gle and rice swamp, and hot and muddy
and raining bucketfuls, but our' colora
stuck first rnte. I'd worked a little in
vention of my own on the make-ups, sur
mising it might wash a bit better than
the regular thing. Second day out we
saw a few amiiros at long range. The
amigos saw us, too, which, was one rea
son why we didn't, see them closer. An
amigo out here seems to be just a plain
duffer, who hasn't an amigo in the world,
and . who wears his shirt outside his
breeches. â¢vi'- ".'
"The second day "out, I think it was, we
were held up for the first time by a gang
of armed rebels and had a chance. to try
our disguises and Prosky's talk on them.
Maybe I didn't have a bad dose of stage
frig'ht at first, but everything went swim
mingly.
"Prosky's talk went all right, I say,
only the other chaps wanted to take 'his

DID you ever stop to think. of the
wonderful organization that in
sures the regular transmission of
every little letter, and its final safu
delivery to .. its owner, even at the re
motest ends of the world, the crowded for
eign city, or the solitudes of the mountain
or the forest? You cannot go to a point ao
Isolated as to be beyond the ministrations
of the poslofflce; but In some foreign coun
tries you would find very strange messen
gers and methods employed. . . . Â¦*â¢ '
In our country the system is so admlr- !
ably organized that the work of the letter
carrier ceases to have any individuality.
If you were to cross the. ocean, however,
and visit some of the countries of As.a
you would see some very queer postmen.
In Northern India, among the Himalayas,
letters are carried . by^/iatlve runners at
the end of a cleft stick. Sometimes one
of the postmen will travel a hundred miles
to convey his precious missive, the' letter
being delivered in as clean a condition as
when It started.
The commonest type of Indian poatrun
ner, or "Tappal-wallali," weirs a Ions
white coat, very light trousers, and a huge
light-blue turban. His letter-bag is slung
from his, shoulder, and he carries a long
stick with a sharp, iron 1 point, which/ can
be used as a weapon in case of need. The
1 . .Â¦ . . m - . 'Â¦: : : Â¦
stick is adorned with six little brass bells,
which serves to give notice of the ap
proach of the post.
. If you ' were in Japan you would see
lithe, wiry runners, withlvery little 1 cloth
ing on their brown bodies, darting here
and there among the crowd. Everybody
gives way before them,. for they are tha
postment of the empire. Their mail .Is
carried in small baskets strapped to their
sides. They, are 'Capable of sustaining* a
good deal of fatigue, and make* wonderful
journeys at times.' Â¦
Among -the placid Chinese hurry is a
form of vulgar Â¦ impatience, consequently"
very little dispatch is used in carryingjhe
mails in that great empire: They are can
tent- to convey ail ordinary communica
tions either' by slow paddling or . poling
boats, or else by foot-runners, whose high
sounding title' of . .'.'the-thousand-milo
horse" does - not quicken their pace . ba
yond about 'Â¦ twelve miles in twenty-four
hours. They carry a paper lantern; and a
paper . umbrella, and their Â¦] letter-basr ia
secured : to 'the . back by -^a* cloth knotted
across the chest.
Among the 'most picturesque letter-car
riers of the world are the "Camel Express
Messengers" of B-khara.'' The men wear a

for' Instance, ; in : the mail service between"
Selkirk and Lake Winnipeg,? where â¢the
work is done by trains of letter-sleighs, i
each drawn by three dogs, .harnessed 'in
as "a jester, a caricaturist, a mocking
bird." Deriving the name by which he is
commonly known from his ... distinctive
ability ( and proclivity to mew like a cat,
he is, nevertheless, a very, prince of song,
and a mimic who cai} rivalthe mocking
bird in his best, efforts at rollicking bird
music. He is a deadly enemy of injurious
insects, harmless in his every, habit of
life. He ""would indeed be a useful and
valuable acquisition that the. State would
be glad to foster. and protect.
. It would be hard to disassociate the
"brown thresher," or "red mavis," as It
is sometimes called, from the catbird,' so
intimate are they in haunts and habits,
even If unlike in form and plumage. In
song this bird ranks among the foremost in
bird life though not possessing the faculty
of mimicking like the catbird. He also
would be " a valuable acquisition and
.doubtless could be readily acclimated and
'made'; to increase and multiply here.
And why not introduce that harlequin
of song birds; the dainty morsel of . the
epicure, the bobolink? Surely for ' part
of the year at least he would find a con
genial home in the tule marshes of the
Sacramento- and San Jo'aquin, where, a3
the "reedblrd" of the Middle States and
the "rice bird" of the South he would at ,
least furnish toothsome tidbits for. the
gourmand, if he did not abide with us and
furnish us with the music of his musically
jangling voice.

It would hot require a wide stretch of
the imagination to conceive that the
scene was laid in California and that tha
red-tiled roofs and Moorish effects of tha
surrounding structures -were but a re
production of an old mission sceneâ on s>
much grander scale, to be sure, but still
California in its general effect.
Why, then, since the two countries are 1
so alike, may not the nightingale find here
a home as congenial and as conducive to
its best vocal efforts as in the leafy
groves around the old Moorish palaces?
And why not Include this primo of all tha
. feathered songsters If any effort is to be *
made for their introduction here? Nona

this Incomparable bird. {BÂ§H
He will bring with him a very tempest .
of song of his own and will repeat from
one end of the gamut to the other all the
notes of the whole army of woodland
warblers that will gather in his train: for
no greater mimic exists than he and none
can boast of a wider and more charming
repertoire of his own.

While there is doubtless morÂ» poetry
than truth In these ' oft-repeated lines
there is certainly more truth than poetry
in the assertion that there are bowers of
roses all over his enchanted land that the
nightingale would seek out for his
favorite haunts and pour forth a flood
of melody that no one of his kind "by
Benderraeer's stream" could ever hope to
rival.
These are but a few of the great host
of feathered songsters who might here
' find genial environment and climatic In

agree; so there can be no doubt that it
would be aroused and developed among
our native birds if the example were only
set before them of others of -their own
species elf ted with the power of song.
And our lark is another illustration. In
the East he is a rare singer; out here he
gurgles. . : :.'
Perhaps he is suffering- from some tu
berculosis; but rather is it more probable
that he merely suffers from ignorance
and years of continual lack of a melodious
example.
His note Is not unmusical, but it is such
a funny, ridiculous little gurgle that it
sounds amusing, compared with the clear,
sweet slurred notes of his Eastern
brother.
Just two prolonged notes of a quality
merely sufficient to arouse in one the de
siro to hear a greater variety and more
of it, but wholly unsatisfactory in its
limited range. And yet the lark's song
proper Is worthy of admiration and un
qualified praise.
"In richness of voice and modulation,"
says Mr. Ernest S. Thompson in his
"Birds of Manitoba," "the lark equals or
excels both wood thrush and nightingale;
and in the beauty of its articulation it
has no superior in the whole world of
feathered choristers with which I am ac
quainted." â¢ ~ .
Surely with such evidence before us, the
proper musical education of our own larks
would seem to be worthy of consideration
and enerzetlc action.
The comparison of the song of the lark
with that of- the wood thrush furnishes
another reminder of . the possibilities in
this direction. Here the latter is a silent

boy in New England, has been well de

centricities, he is appropriately set down
Eut it is not alone through the introduc- Â¦
tion of song birds whose congeners find
habitat here, but which are, silent, that
benefit is to be derived. The' field is open
for others known here at all and with
a world-wide fame as singers.. A few. ex- â¢'
amples need only be cited here. <*,'
And it will be no difficult task to import
teachers for this large class who would
call around them thousands of dusky
hued birds that soon might rival the song
their species "on Michigan's shore" and.
give inspiration to the poet here to wel
come the singer and glorify his song.
"Even the blackbirdâ he of the golden
wing and brightly burnished, inky plum
age, whose vocal register is here limited
to an utterance half-way between the
chirp of a sparrow and the croak of a
cr&w â is none the less v/orthy of an op
portunity for voice development and cul
tivation. As the old-time poet has It,'
The bia-efcblrd is singing on Michigan's shore
As sweetly and caily as ever before.
and shy bird; loVely in his mottled plum
age and just such an ideal bird figure as
might be looked to for singing quality.
Alas.' he utters no note that can be de
s-cribed or remembered: while in the East
he is held In high esteem as one of the
finest, and by many set down* as the supe
rior of all "the merry laughing birds" that
inhabit that region.
At that time the criticism was not with
out Justiflcatfon to a large extent. Car
peted as the whole face of the country
was through the earlv months of the year
â¢with a profusion of wild flowers they
Â¦were nevertheless practically without per
fume other than the aromatic, spicy odor
now so familiar to all who live among
them. Since then, however, the capabil
ity of the country for the production of
every flower that grows has been so
widely tested that the whole face of na
ture has become a garden of beauty and
every breeze that is wafted across It Is
laden with a delightful perfume from the
flowers that adorn its surface.
But the "song" bird still -refuses to
sing!
Is it possible thai all the Pattis and
Jenny Llnds and Sembrichs of the feath
ered tribe who are so unfortunate as to
lose their voices come out here to try
to get them back? If so, it is rather
hard on us!
The floriculturist has changed the face
of nature; he has taught flowers how to
bloom and exhale their fragrance as all
beautiful flowers should do; may not
man now try his hand upon these .feath
ered creatures and see if he cannot
verify the truth of the adage. "Birds
that can sing and won't sing must be
made to sing"? /
With all its wealth of vegetation, gen
tle climate and apparent capabilities of
being the natural home of song birds, why
should the voices of nearly all of them
be comparatively silent? We listen in
vain for the flood of bird melody that
welcomes the rising sun and glorifies the
evenings of the East. We hear the mel
ancholy complaint of the mourning dove,
varied sometimes with the. brief note of
WE HAVE some Pattls and Sem
brichs here tn our midst, but
they <So no singing. Can't we
bring them out?
They are a group of songbirds,
prettily feathered little fellows that make
the woods and fields alive with chirping in
their native East, but for some reason
are still in our sunshine.
Perhaps they are homesick. Many of our
birds East and are never heard to sing
again. That is easier to understand, for
the Eastern chill of manner and of cli
mate sets in and silences them. But for
an Eastern bird to refrain from singing
in the midst of our flowers and our
warmth and our sunshineâ how can he?
The lark is one of themâ that happy bird
most of all associated with music The
blackbird is another, and the catbird and
the robin. To be 6ure they all make
noises, but these are sad substitutes for
their music The fault-finding tourist
points at the obstinate rascals and sneers
exultantly. He has been expecting to fall
right into heaven Immediately upon

of gold upon the street corners! The tour
ist Is aggrieved. He feels like wanting his
money back. . -â¢ ';.
And California is compelled to hang her
head and mournfully concede the fact.
And the early comers, even of the days
of '45, were disposed to be hypercritical
in all matters pertaining to soil and cli
mate and their accessories of song birds
and wild flowers. The land, lying yet
practically a virgin soil undisturbed by
the plow, gave little promise of its capa-
I bilities and wore an aspect of unpromising
aridity rather than a hopeful outlook for
profitable agricultural development. Fre
mont's glowing description of the country,
its natural beauties and possibilities, be
came largely the subject of satirical com
ment and not infrequent ridicule; but
later on they learned to appreciate the
fact that Fremont was right.
The country that was considered an arid
â¢waste has blossomed like the rose; but
the poor stupid "song" bird continues to
epeak largely in the alphabetical language
of the deaf mute. He has not developed
with the country/
It used to be an aphorism that Cali
fornia was a place where "the flowers
were without perfume and the birds with
out song."
The familiar member of the thrush fam
ily known in the East as the "robin" fur
nishes an interestins . example. .* His ac
complishments as a singer are familiar to
every one raised east of the Rocky Moun
tains. One of the most welcome of all
the singing birds that there usher in tho
spring, he, Is also one of the most useful
as an insect destroyer and therefore an
ally always to be counted upon for friend
ly and adventitious aid by the farmer and
horticulturist. Famous as a song bird to
an extent that has made him the favorite
of the poet and the pastoral writer, he
brings cheer to every household and is
fostered and beloved by all.
But what of his namesake here, < his
"ppor relation." as it were?
He never utters a note, except a chirp
of alarm or a wild scream of fear when
protecting his young from attack.
When "Cock Robin" of the East is fill
ing the air with melodies from some tall
tree at sunset, his counterpart â¢Â¦ of Cali
fornia is silent in the thicket; engaged in
digesting the most recently captured
worm preparatory to tucking his head be
neath his wing tÂ» sleep and wait for an
other silent morrow.
Br'er Robin needs a teacher! . . â¢
â¢ Undoubtedly he has a voice of some
kind. Why not give him a chance to de
velop it under a competent instructor?
Upon the subject of the Imitative fac
ulty In birds all authorities on ornithology
Some examples of well-known singing
birds In other States and their silent con
geners here may, however, be cited and
compared with profitable results.
With all these things in their favor the
cultured bird of the East would thrive
and multiply: his silent brother of the
Pacific slope .would hear and admire; the
Instinct of imitation would lead him to
attempt the same vocal feats: a triumph
would have been achieved and a new song
put Into the mouth of the little chap who
for so long had known nothing but a
chirp.
The large increase of forestry since
American occupation would doubtless
greatly facilitate the successful introduc
tion of song birds: it would also tend to
preserve in them their one peculiar at
tribute; since it may be set down as a
well established fact in nature that nearly
every song bird seeks a tree or shrub
from which to pour forth Its melodies and
few ever attempt, to do so from the
ground. Perhaps 'the nakedness of the
country In the matter of forestry orjgin
ally had much to do with silencing the
voices of our native birds, which in name,
plumage, habits and general appearance
are the same as their counterparts of oth
er lands; but that is a question for sci
entists to discuss.
If properly protected by law the im
ported birds might simply be brought here
and set free in our hills and valleys. They
would thrive on the plant and Insect life
found there, mate and rear their youae.
And it Is not an unfeasible idea. Cali
fornia stocked her streams and bays with
fish originally foreign to these waters.
Foreign plants thrive in the soil equally
well with the indigenous varieties. We
ourselves who come from the East become
acclimated and live comfortably here and
grow fat. The land, the water, the cli
mate are all friendly to strangers.
Isn't it a good idea?
It would be profitless, perhaps, to in
quire Into the why and wherefore of this
bird silence in California, but it ought
not to be a profitless task to endeavor
to introduce song birds here, not only to
gladden the hearts of the people with
their melodies, but perhaps to become
the educators of those of like species

musical capabilities have possibly never

from England until a comparatively short
time ago. have Increased largely. In 1S97
their value was $2,4S2,20S, and In 1900.
$9,218,144. Of this total, British Nortlx
America took rails to the value of $2.8S2,-*

value of sewing machines exported in
creased from $3,S40.241 in 1S97 to $4,540,842

typewriters in foreign countries Is shown
by the increase In exports from $1,453,117
in 1897 to $2,697,544 In 1900. Despite the fact
that many classes of machinery stated

the increase under this latter headlnsr Is

ports was from $1,708,224 in 1897 to $4,274,
174. This was in part due to the success
ful efforts which American manufacturers
have been. making for a few years to in
troduce their boots and- shoes into Euro
pean markets, and the sales to the United
Kingdom last year amounted to $950,267.
The largest foreign market for American
shoes, however, Is in British Australasia,
which took goods to the value of $1.174437'

consumer of United States coal, taking it
to the value of $15,124,850 in 1900. In the
last few years, however, the coal miners
of the United States .have begun to find a
market in Europe, the exports to France,
for instance, having increased from $3985
in 1897 to $144,129 in 1900. while Germany,
Italy and other European countries took
increasing quantities, and a few cargoes
even went to England, a veritable carry

. Exporters of almost every,- article Â¦ pro
duced - or manufactured in ; the United
States are beginning to find ] markets for
their roods' In these : islands and Vthesa
The inhabitants of all the islands are
rapidly adopting American clothing and
American boots and shoes. As all of them
have warm climates, comparatively few
.woollen goods are used, and the largest
increases are shown in cottons. In 1S97
Cuba bought cotton goods in the United
States to the value of only $67,452, while
in 1900 she bought cottons to the value of
$612,252. Porto 'Rico bought to, the. value
of $12,002 in 1S97. and $312,459 In 1900.' The
exports of cottons to Hawaii" and the
Philippine Islands in 1897 were so small
that 'they were not stated ; separately in
the .treasury statistics. In 1900 the exports
to' Hawaii had grown to $572,551 and those
to the Philippines to $29,744. The total ex
ports of-boots and shoes in 1897 were* so
small that they were not given by coun
tries at all, and very few went 'to any of
the islands. In 1900 the exports to Cuba
were $248,937, 'to Porto Rico $25,759, to Ha
waii $191,884 and to" the' Philippines $6610. V
Tie ir.;.a.ijHanls of all tht. islands have
acquired a remarkable liking for Amer
ican beer, and the exports of this com
modity to meet their demands are growing
rapidly. In 1S97 the exports of "domestic
malt liquors from the United States
amounted in value to only $723,796. In 1900
the value had grown to $2,137,527, and a
large proportion of the total went to the
insular possessions of the Government,
There were shipped to Cuba 445,960, dozen
bottles valued at $600,995, and 286.549 gal
lons, valued at $76,527. Porto Rico drank
69,635 dozen bottles, valued at $101,217. Ha
waii drank 142,161 dozen ; bottles, worth
$147,584, and 146,410 \ gallons, worth' $39,136,
while the Philippines took 469,451 .dozen
bottles, valued at $557,807,- and 16,080 gal
lons, worth $4143. The consumption of dis
tilled spirits exported from- the United
States to the islands was comparatively
light. Cuba took 5534 gallons of Bourbon
whisky and 8146 gallons of rye whisky.
Porto Rico consumed 2864 gallons of Bour
bon and 2230 gallons of rye. There are
heavier drinkers of whisky in the Pacific
than in the West Indies, for Hawaii took
22,426 gallons of Bourbon and 722 gallons
of rye, while the Philippines took 53,310
gallons of Bourbon and 5111 gallons of rye.

markets will continually expand as Amer
ican goods come to be better known and
the consuming power of the . inhabitants
grows with their increase in \ prosperity
under just and stable governments. While
the percentages of increase have been
larger in the exports to the islands now
under the sovereignty" of the United
States, the largest increases in value have
taken place in exports to countries having
better developed markets, and in some
lines .these increases have been phenom
enal. . ' . . â¢. â¢;-..-
â¢Y~y UROPEAN NATION'S did not need
_/ to wait for the billion and a naif
I f steel trust before taking alarm at
**""\* the American campaign for the
commercial conquest of the world.
J. Pierpont Morgan's great combination
has brought it home to them vividly, but
commercial America has been expanding
ever since territorial expansion was . an
accomplished fact. It expanded $338,874,
084 in foreign commerce in 1900 over 1897,
the year before the war. It has expanded
in the first eight months of the present
year $296,404,259 over the first eight months
of 1897. In iron and steel exports alone
the expansion In 1900 over 1897 has been
$64,361,039, and it may almost double these
figures this year.
In another notable instance â¢ has the
maxim that "trade follows the flag"
been illustrated lately. Spain is suffering
from great business depression. She is
on thÂ« verge of an Industrial crisis.
Â¦Every branch of her trade is suffering
from the loss of her colonies. Her Im
ports to Cuba have shrunk from $136,
000,000 to $66,000,000; to Puerto Rico from
$44,000,000 to $17,000,000, to the Philippines
from $49,000,000 to $27,000,000. Her total
loss In trade through the passing of her
last colonial possessions is $123,000,000 a
year.
Now look at the American picture.
During the three years which have passed
since the breaking out of the war with
Spain the foreign trade of the country
has grown by leaps and bound?. Ameri
can goods are making their way into
'every market of the world in Increasing
quantities, but most remarkable of all has
been the development of the commerce
between this country and the islands over
Â¦which the sovereignty of ' the United
States was extended as a result of the
Spanish war. The maxim that "trade
follows the flag" has never received a
more striking verification.
Not . only have ' the exports of bread
stuffs, meat products, cotton, petroleum
and other products which are exported in
their natural state, or nearly so, largely
Increased, but there has been a still
more striking Increase In the export of
manufactured goods, such as machinery
of all kinds, textiles, and boots, and
Ehoes. Until within the last' few years,
exnortjy of American manufactured goods
have been made up largely of what were
termed "Yankee notions." Now the coun
try is exporting everything, from steel
bridges to be erected in Egypt or India,
and locomotives to be run in Siberia or
Africa, to typewriters, cash registers,
pocket knives, and pins and needles.
For the fiscal year which ended June
30,1897 â the last complete fiscal year before
the Spanish war â the exports of merchan
dise of all kinds, including silver bullion,
amounted in value to $1,112,024,562^ For the
fiscal year ended June . 30, 1900â the last
complete fiscal yearâ the total reached
the amount of $1,450,898,646. This rate Is
still keeping up and for the eight months
of the present fiscal year the total " ex
ports to foreign countries foot up $1,015,
193.4S9, against but $735,085,143 for the
same period in 1897, and this notwithstand
ing the fact that the commerce between
the United States and Hawaii and be
tween the United States and Porto Rico
Is no longer considered foreign commerce,
and is not included as such in the statis
tics of the Treasury Department. Another
factor that has tended to reduce the
figures for the present year below what
they would otherwise have been in the
unsettled condition of affairs in China.
Exports to the Chinese Empire were in
creasing very rapidly when the *Boxer
troubles broke out there last year, bat
for the first eight months of this year
they are nearly $5,000,000 less than for the
same period last year.
If a cpmparison between' the present
year and 1S97 is to be made on a fair basis
the exports to Hawaii and Porto Rico
must be added to the foreign commerce,
and this would bring the figures for the
first eight months of the present fiscal
year up to $1,031,488,442, or a gain of $296,
404.299 over the Bame months in 1S97.
Although there- has been a greater pro
portionate increase in exports to other
parts of the world, Europe still continues
to be the best customer of -..he United
States, taking in 1000 goods to the value of
$1,040,167,312,' against $813,380,332 in 1837. in'
the same period exports to.. Asia have in
creased from 539,268,755 to $64,913,984, while
in exports to Oceanica the increase has
been from $22,652,773 to $43,390,927. and the
exports to Africa have increased from
$16,953,127 to $19,469,109. The' increase in ex
ports, to South America has not been aa
The exports to the islands under the
control of the United States embrace a
wide ( range of articles. Cuba took, in 1890,
cattle and ather animals to the value of
$2,983,766; s breadstuffs to the value of J2.914,
870; iron and steel to the value of $3,717,127;
provisions' to the value of $5,214,489, and
manufactures of wood to the value" of
$2,122,553. The principal exports to Porto
Rico were breadstuff s to the value. of
$1,013,204. The largest item in Hawaii's ac
count was iron and steel to the amount of
$5,064,306. Cuba bought eleven locomotives
at a cost of $76,607. Porto. Rico 'took one
worth $4500 and'Hawali took two at a cost
of $7625. There were shipped to Cuba
nineteen organs and seventy-two pianos;
to Porto .Rico eight organs and eighteen
pianos; to Hawaii nineteen organs and 118
sianos. and to the . Philippines one or can.
Some of these /. goods are, of course,
bought by Americans in the islands, but
these Americans bring them to the notice
of the natives. ' It has been said that ev
ery American soldier in the insular pos
sessions of the United States is a commer
cial agent, for the natives see the kind
of things he uses and want similar goods
for themselves. ' . : .
That trade has followed the flag is
shown by the remarkable increases In ex
ports to Cuba, the Philippine Inslands,
Hawaii and Porto Rico. The total exports
to Cuba in 1S97 amounted to but $8,250,776,
while in 1900 they had grown to $26,513,613.
The' increase in the exports to the Philip
pines was in still greater proportion. Be
fore the islands were acquired by the
United States American goods were al
most unknownâ the total value of the ex
ports to the islands ; being but $94,597 in
1S97. The total in 1900 had risen to $2,640.
449. The exports to Hawaii grew from
14,690,075 in 1S97 to' $13,509,158 in 1900, and
those to Porto Rico increased from $1,988,
888 in 1897 to $4,040,431 in 1900. These figures
do not include supplies sent to these
islands for the United States military and
naval forces or for the use of the United
States authorities in any way. They are
the purely commercial exports .which pass
through the custom houses.
satisfactory, the growth being frum $33,
768,493 in 1S97 to $3S,945,721 in 1900. The ex
ports to other countries in North America
in 1897 were $124,963,773, and in 1900^$187,
209.318.

They have. more vivacity than usually

In color they, vary from pale fawn
through shades of brown to chocolate.
There are two varieties, the temple cats
and the palace cats, about the onijPdiffe'

SOME CURIOUS STORIES ABOUT EN=
TERPRISING SPIDERS
5T IS a curious Tact that these floating
threads from tho webs of spiders will
lake the blulnjr oft* a gun barrel.-, I
have been unable to find out why. The
thuds of the big troplcai spiders are dis
tinctly bitter to the taste, but though the
first thought a man has when he tastes
anything bitter Is that it must be good for
medicine, the only use the healing art
makes of solders' webs is to use thv.nv to_
stanch the flow of blood. . The klinlof"
web used for that grows under the coun
ters of'grocerles andlt was one of these
spiders that caught a mouse. I will ad
mit, light in the beginning, that this looks
like a pretty large story, but it is sub
stantiated'by no less a personage than,
tho late Proctor Knott, who was then
Governor of Kentucky, though' his greater
claim to fame was his speech in '. Con
gress about- Duluth, 'the zenith city' of
the unsalted seas,' as I he humorously
called it, which is very far indeed from
being anything nowadays but a plain
statement of fact, as he lived to ! see.
Governor Knott made' a signed statement
of the event and sent it to Professor Mc-
Cook, whose authority on the spider ques
tion . noLodv 'Â¦will dispute. He saw the
spider shortly after 1 she had, snared the
mouse by the end of its tall, and while
it wasi still alive and struggling hal*-way
oint the ground, and he saw it after It
had been hoisted nine inches from the
floor and all wrapped up in silk, ftc calls
particular, attention to the way the spider
kept : Btirrlng up the mouse by bitiny L it

but; I. thinks, to myself, "I'll mebby never
git another chance to; git so much. meat

Bfg Buffalo, a chief who was once a war
rior, then jumped into' the center of the
ring and called to them in a loud voice:
, "It pleases me in my heart to see you
all here ready; The sun Is high, and we
must take "new courage. . We are about to
tall upon the Great Spirit to choose us a
new 'leader; ; Young men of my bosom, do
not be deceived, for you will not have a
traitor to rule you again. The crow has
spoken to me In my dreams, and he says
we will be happy after this. It pleases me
In my heart to see you so full of joy. You
must learn the dance good in your heart.
I am done. 'My name is Big Buffalo."
Then' the drum sent forth wild strains,
and the young men leaped and shouted
- -..-â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ y Â¦Â¦' '
the wa. : song again. - The bells on their
limbs jingled, but in the din were scarcely
heard. Their painted faces were wreathed
in fiendish smiles. -The sun, 'even though
in winter, was warm enough to \melt the
paint on their faces, and it trickled down
their faces in little furrows. \ The sun
was hiding behind the cliff when they quit
the dance.
Then the women went forth and killed
the fat dogs for the evening meal. It is
the duty of the women to do most of the
work about the camp, and as dog meat Is
one of their favorite dishes they were put
to work slaying the canines.. The feast
was held in the open, and lasted until
they had eaten their fill. That
several hours, so there was no dance' on
the second night.
The three leading chiefs, Humming
Bird, Rain Water and Big Buffalo, had
during the feast disappeared into the
bark medicine lodge for the purpose of
talking with the Great Spirit during the
night. 'Their actions caused much sup
pressed "excitement among the redskins.
In the hands of these three men rested
the decision as to who should be chosen
for the next chief. V
Announcing the Choice. '
â¢\ The young- men rode about on their
ponies Â¦ until quite â¢ late. They were all
dressed in gay colors and sang love songs
to the pretty,, young girls who accom
panied their : parents. But the old men
of, the tribe were restless. They lay out
side of their tepees and chanted . to the
Great Prophet' to; make 'the decision' of
the medicine men a wise one. -It was a
peculiar, circumstance! Here were love
making and devotion, but both of a very
different nature. AH night this was kept
up and! few In camp slept. , *
â¢ Before . daybreak -^the : hum of voices
awakened .those present .' as spectators.'
Three hundred men and .women â¢ had as
i "i i ii TÂ« i im iiiiflnlfaiâiiyiinnrÂ»iÂ«nÂ»ir niiiiai iminiini ill
at the foot of the dancing grounds. Be
fore the sun was well up other Indians
began to arrive. All were dressed In
gaudy colors, with their faces, arms and
breaists decorated In red and black paint.
The Indians who came brought their tents
with them. The ground where they were
camped was worn smooth by being tram
pled upon.
Pull Many Korse3 went about crying
that the young" men would hold a dance
shortly. He was "entirely naked, except
for the breechcloth. His 'slender body was
painted in red and white. Just below his
knees he. wore a> string of sleigh bells,
whfth Jingled merrily as he rode through
the town.. His long, black hair was held
in place by a war bonnet made .'from
beaver skin and decorated with "turkey
feathers. Around his long sinewy, arms he
wore brass bands, and his neck bore. a
string of beads. 'Other young men as
p'sted him, and there. mu3t have been at
least 100 who were dressed about in the
came manner.
The yotmg men gathered in a circle and
commenced to dance. Each carried a tom
ahawk and. went through motions sup
posed to depict their actions in battle.
Then the drum was started and they
danced and sang songs for an hour, .while
truly happy, wnen.In the midst ot just
such wild orgies as here described, are
these same Indians, whom the United
States should take in hand and tame. *
Thirty years ago the Qsages were the
most powerful tribe in- The West, but
smallpox cut down their tnumber two
thirds. Then they moved on a reserva
tion south of Kansas and have remained
there in comparative seclusion for twenty
years. In this time they have retro
graded. They have fallen into many sav
age traits, such as eating dog meat, burn
ing their dead at the stake and going
about naked. . '
Big Heart, the newly elected medicine
chief,' made these declarations as part of
his policy as chieftain:
"I will have nothing to do with the
white men. They are our worst enemies.
I will run them out if they come here
and try to change our ways of "living. We
are going back to our old habits of life.
If the white people do not like this they
can get out. In the summer time we will
not wear any clothes, and we will have
all of our medicine dances."
The tribal government of. the Osages
was organized thirty years ago by Clare
more, a wise o!d warrior. There were a
chief, assistant chief, cecretary, treasurer
and thirty councilmen. The chief was
elected by the council for a term of four
years. He appointed his assistant! and
also the two cabinet officers. The coun
cilmen bad the power to pass any kind
of a bill they chose, but the. chief could
kill the bill. The United States is per
mitted to station an agent In the midst
of this kingdom, but he" has no power
over the Indians. He pays them their in
terest every three months and keeps them
frcm offending white peopleâIf he can.
The land of the nation is rich in min
erals and the mountains abound In coal.
Along the rivers the farming land is rich.
Tbo forests abound in game, but the In
dians are too lazy to kill any of it. Neith
er do they want the white man to come
and enjoy the sport. .
Big Heart, a coroulent full-blood, has
been chief of the tribe for a great many
years. Until four years ago he was de
clared by the medicine men to be in bad
standing with the Great Prophet, so he
was defeated. Instead the tribe chose .a
young man named Eagle Chief, .who fa
vored allotment of land and dissolution
of tribal government. The full-blood3
were In favor of burning him at the stake
for, his stand on public affairs, At_ the
present ceremony his name was not con
sidered for re-electlonT ." ,"*>.
On the morning following the opening'
of the ceremonies the redskins were out
of 'their*' tepees early. As soon as the
dancers had got well awake . they went
and plunged in a stream which flowed
sembled on the smooth circle. They had
not - slept â¢ at all. A number of men sat
about the edge of the tircle and held long
poles to which were strung pieces of
cloth. In the .center was piled a large
amount of clothes, fine blankets, saddles,
cloth and cheap Jewelry. This was their
offering to the Great Spirit. When the
pile had reached enormous proportions
arid each Indian had contributed, it was
set afire. While it was burning the In
dians wailed and moaned most plteously.
<They kept this up until the pile of costly

they arose and ate.
About noon the medicine men nme
from their bark lodges, weak from fast
ing and sweating. They called the In
dians together and told them they had
chosen Big Heart â¢ for their next chief
and Rolling Pony for his assistant. When
the announcement was made not a cheer
fell from the lips of the 600 assembled
redskins. It was nor. their way. Instead,
they made preparations for the dance.
While the warriors- and medicine men
were painting theinselves for this dancs
the women gathered up the banners of
the sacrifice dance and went in for a
little dance alone. Finally the chief med
icine man commanded them to stop that
the principal dance of the series could
commence. This was the last act in the
selection of a new chief.
Big Heart, accompanied by ; Big Buf
falo, entered the center of the dancing
circle. Quickly the other dancers closed
in about them. The dancers were thinly
clad and were painted - in many colors.
Each carried a whistle, upon which he
blew constantly. They Joined bands and
circled to the right, singing:
"Our Father, make our new chief,
"Oh, make him a wise man
"Let us live happy'
"And have many feasts.".
A few days ago the tribal election -was
held and the whole tribal vote was legally
cast for Big Heart.
Such is the crude manner In which a
chief of the Osages is chosen. While few
know of it, it is generally believed that
they abide by the nominations made, but,
as In many political conventions, every
thing has been cut and dried long before

I I grew louder and the chanting more
I fierce. Soon a ?mk of cowpuncn

The hunters visiting the Osage
Xatioa, in Oklahoma, for their first hunt,
were invited by the cowpunchers to go
along and â¢witness the event. So it was
teat two sleepy hunters rolled out from
between warm blankets and attended the
opening number of a series of events
which comprised the election of chief of
the Osa.se Indians, the richest uncivilized
people on earth.
Thickly studding the sky, the stars
glimmered over the domain of the savage.
Around high cliffs, between deep chasms,
down steep trails and across swift flowing
streams, into the valley rode the party of
white men. The stream drowned other
sounds, but above the sighing of the wind
came the wild chanting of the medicine
men.
While yet far away the flickering light
from thÂ« medicine lodges could be dis
cerned. Approaching downward on a
steep trail, an excellent view of the camp
was obtained. There were at least one
hundred tepees stretched In a circle a
quarter of a mile in diameter. The open-
Ing of every one faced the center and in
front of most of them sat a group of In
dia-i woman and men.
In the center was a large fire. Around
this sat a number of Indians, dressed in
gay colors. They were the medicine men
of the tribe. They were all the while go
ing through a lot of queer motions, as if
insane. Some would climb up a huge pole
near the flames and scan the assembly as
if looking for a lost friend. Others would
rush at the fire and pull out a burning
stick. This they would hold in front of
one of their number as long as the flames
lasted. If the flames burned straight
the man was yet in the good graces of the
Great Spirit, but if it flickered to one side
then he was at once commanded to leave
the medicine lodge. All the while they
kept up the medicine chanting to the ac
companying beats of the drum.
: â¢ The Dance Begins.
In a short time a tall young redskin,
named Rain Water, ran from the midst of
the medicine men and circled about in
front Of the tepees where the reds were
waiting. He cried out that the dance
â¢would now begin. Immediately there
was a rush for the nearest posts about
the fire. No ceremony attended the com
mencement of the dance. Five hundred
women and braves Joined hands and
whirled around In a circle, yelling:
"We are dancing, ah ya!
"We will dance, ah ya!
"Until the new chief appears."
This dance was kept up until nearly
daylight with no special feature. It was
the opening of the campaign, as It -were,
when the candidates solicited votes. There
were many in the assembly of dancers
who had designs on the chieftaincy, but
none would dare to mention it for fear
of offending the Great Spirit.

to the. woman, this exercise is easier for
her than 'for the man, since she is more

are good. The child does not feel so much
fatigue as the adult, but It should use

CURSE OF THE COCAINE HABIT
r? N a Jecture before the New York
School of Clinical Medicine, Dr. Thom-
Jl as D. Crothers of Hartford, Conn.,
characterised cocainism as one of the
three great scourges of the world, alco
holism and morphinism being the other
two.
Custom-house reports, the lecturer said,
show an enormous increase recently in the
importation of this drug, and not more
than the one-sixtieth f>art of what Is now
cold is used for legitimate purposes. The
vice of cocainism is spreading alarmingly
among the poor as well as the rich, as the
drug is becoming cheaper all the time. A
one-ounce package, which less than five
years ago cost $6, can now be purchased
for 75 cents.
One result of this cheapening is that the
cocaine habit is becoming common among
tramps and paupers as well as business
and professional men. It is no lonper an
aristocratic vice, if it ever was. In New
Orleans and other jiarts of the South and
West the drug is freely bought in 5-cent
packages.
Dr. Crothers regards the use of the
drug, even as a local anesthetic for sur
gical purposes. asÂ» exceedingly dangerous,
especially in c-ises where the subsequent
reaction is characterized by headache,
lassitude and depression! Yet its use in
Furgery is becoming very common. The
lecturer also deprecated the fact that
many popular proprietary remedies con
tain cocaine in large quantities.
It is almost a specific for catarrhal trou
bles, and though using it as,a remedial
agent unconsciously many persons,
charmed with its speedy and delightful
results, become addicted to it habitually,
and finally become slaves to Its use.
Its first effects in small doses are to
create a feeling of elation, of greatly in
creased mental and physical superiority,
and of freedom from care and anxiety.
The morphinist finds in it a substitute to
relieve the pence of depression following
the use of that narcotic. The hard drinker
is charmed with its effects, as his depres-
sion yields to a sense of elation and ab
normal exaltation. . .
But in the u&e of cocaine there follows
a sure reaction. In a short time there
are developed characteristic symptoms of
the habitual cocainist. If he be a lawyer,
a writer or a clergyman he shows marvel
ous fluency and prolixity of speech. He
has a rare fecundity of words, but they
betray a tendency toward circumlocution
and irrelevancy. In letter writing he be-

CORD SALISBURY is one of tne

with his friends at a well laden din
ner table. One evening while so
situated he had been keeping the whole
company alive by his conversation when
suddenly he stopped short in what he was
saying and his face was seen to become
grave and anxious. After a pause of some
minutes, during which his Lordship sat
speechless and motionless, his neighbor
asked him what was the matter. .
"It has come," he muttered in a voice
of despair. ,' ,
"What has come?" was the bewildered
reply. >^>

trays his secret vice by his diffuseness
without directness.
"There .are .novels, which are highly
popular to-day," said the lecturer, "which
shew almost conclusive evidence of hav
ing been written under the influence; of co
caine, and several poems characterized by
marvelous rhythm and smoothness, have
had their inspiration in this drug.
"Habitual use of it impairs the judg
ment and results in the grandiose ideas
often associated with paretic diseases.
One's sense of right and wrong becomes
impaired. A man formerly, open and
frank becomes secretive, selfish and. dis
honest. A Wall street authority told me
that he knew of three of the most reckless
operators of recent years whose losses of
fortunes are directly due to impairment
of their judgment through the use of co
caine.
"After the abnormal sense of elation
and power, come delusions. The victim
fears sudden attack. He sits up at night
watching for burglars. He is fearful of
accident and abnormally suspicious of im
aginary persecutors. Most victims in this
ntase carry revolvers.
"One of them once came to me in this
condition. He was a physician, who had
lost his wife and familv in , the Johns
town flood, and had taken to cocaine to
soothe him in his great affliction. He had
two revolvers when he told me of-tho

matters, but thought ne had hidden ene
mies. I finally persuaded him to surrend
er his^,- firearms, and the first nighty ho
compromised on a stout baseball bat un
der his pillow. He finally conquered the
appetite, but it required years of hard
struggling."
Â¦ Dr. Crothers narrated many similar in
stances, especially among brain workers.
He recommended as the best curative
method complete abstinence from .the
drug, combined with Turkish and electrio
baths, mineral., waters and tonics, judi
cious restraint, careful and abstemious
diet and a long rest, i He knows of no spe
cific for the cure of the habit.

the rugs taken up and there is plenty of
room for twenty, or thirty couples to
dance easily and without walking all over
everybody else.

in the boys' or girls' apartment, and that

SOME OF SACRAMENTO'S "ALPHA SIGMA" GIRLS
THE BEST KNOWN SCHOOL FRATERNITY IN THE UNITED STATESTHE WEALTHIEST INDIANS IN
THE UNITED STATES.
<j7T? T THE office of Commissioner of
/L\ Indian Affairs a few days ago con
ii were let to cattlemen for the
renting of the pasture lands of
the Osage Indians, in Oklahoma. These
Indians have &0J.O0O acres of pasture" lands,
of which 000,03) acres were rented. This
will add to the annual income of the tribe
about 5120.030. "And already," said Cup
tain A. C. Tonr.cr, assistant commissioner
of Indian Allans, recently, "the Osage In
dians are the richest people in the world. '
Several years ago the lands of the
Osages in Kansas were sold, the sale re
alizing 58,000,000. This meney was placed
in the Treasury of the United States, and
from it the Osage Indians derive an an
nual income of $400,000. In addition to this
they own 1,570,185 acres of land, which is
fairly worth Jo an acre. .making the value
of their land holdings $7,853,875. There are
1372 Indians in the tribe, counting men,
women and children. They all share alike
in the tribal wealth, and when, a child i3
born it becomes a joint property owner
with ail the other Indians in the tribe.
The profits from the $8,000,000 held in the
Treasury, the recent rental of pasture
lands, and other sources of revenue, give
the Osages an annual income of approx
imately $600,000, a. per capita income of
$304 25 for each man, woman and child.
When a family consists of man and wife
and eight children, as often happens, the
family receives each year in cash $3040,
and on their lands they raise all their
foodstuffs and considerable grain for the
market.
The realty holdings of the tribe have a
per capita valuation ; of $3987, or, for a
family of ten, $39,870. There is no other
race of people In the world, it Is declared,
that can make such a showing.
The Osage Indians have not failed to
r-rotit by this wealth. The sons and
daughters of families are sent East to
colleges and boarding schools to be edu
cated, many of them receiving profession
al training. There are a few families, of
course, which still live with almost the
simplicity that marked the lives of their
savage ancestors, but the desire for edu
cation and culture is rapidly sprctidlng,
and when the Osages become citizens a
few years ; hence they will be fully
equipped for the duties and responsibili
ties of citizens-nip.
The homes of some of the most pro
gressive Osages compare favorably with
the dwellings of white people of equal
wealth. Their houses are richly furnished
with carpets and modern furniture; and in
many homes there are. pianos upon which
the boarding-school training of the daugh
ters has taught them to perform. Horses
and carriages are not infrequent, and
though the automobile has not yet made
its appearance, it: is not an impossibility,
of the future. - f'.-
The enviable condition of the Osages
has led to a considerable influx of white
settlers on the reservations, 'many white
men seeking alliances with the daughters
of Osage families. The tribal government,
however, has found a way. if not -to stop,
at least to profit by. this white emigration.
From every white person on the reserva
tion a monthly poll 'tax, of: $1' is collected.
The imposition of this tax has driven from
the reservation many 'suitors .for the
hands of Osage maidens and has given
those who remain an ardor and eagerness
for matrimony which might not follow

expensive luxuries.â Washington Post.

PROBABLY no country on earth is
more Interesting to the traveler on
the lookout for oueer things and
unusual experiences than the Sllvas
of the Amazon, and here is a story about
an Indian tribe of that region told by
Arthur Axtell, an American traveler, that
can hardly be beaten:
These particular Indians were contin
ually bent on discovery and experiment
ing, says Mr. Axtell. Somehow they had
come into jjossetslon of some silkworms.
These worms were not known before in
that country, and most of them died be
fore the natives found out how to raise
them. But they persevered, and, by feed
ing them on the tender leaves of 3ome
native plant3, produced a good quality
of silk, not so good as the Chinese prod
uct by feeding the worms on white mul
berry leaves, but nevertheless a strong,
serviceable silk, certainly good enough for
the dusky bodies of these savages, for
this silk has not yet become an article of
commerce.
Their method of obtaining the silk and
transforming it into garments was crude.
When the moths laid the eggs the na
tives carried them in great quantities in
belts about their bodies, thus giving the
eggs the body heat. At the end of win-'
ter the eggs were hatched and the re
sult was an army of caterpillars. These
were trained to crawl over the naked
bodies of the' natives. This was their
home. They knew no other, and -seemed
quite contented.
During eight weeks the savage is cov
ered with these yellow crawlers. It
would seem that thousands of creeping
caterpillars over one's body from head to
foot would tickle one to death. Certainly,
a white man would find it unbearable, but
it must be remembered these natives of
Brazil are scarcely human. To them it
is intensely interesting, to train these
worms in the way they should go. Small
bits of leaves are stuck on the bodies of
the natives in regular rows, and round
and round the worms go, feeding on the

These caterpillar-covered "niggers," as
Dr. F. A. Marsh, who was of our party,
called them, sleep on their backs at night
and are careful not to turn over In their
sleep. That would be a sad calamity.
When we came to their village thera
were I ten Indians, men and women* In
the act of raising silk caterpillars by this
unique process. They were a sight to .
chill the blood. I know the blood stopped
flowing in my veins. I stood still and
shuddered. Yet there was a fascination
about it, for I had been told what tiS ob
ject of it was and I admired the savaga
ingenuity.
After the worms have become dizzy
with playing the "merry-go-round" on
the bodies of the savages they quit eat
ing and commence spinning the outer cov
ering for the cocoons. When this labor 13
done the natural process of silk-making is
interfered with. The savages had found
out that when the cocoons were finished
they would burst, or the worms would
eat their way out. In either case the silk
was destroyed. So the worms are pre
vented from making the cocoons. Instead,
the fiber for the outer covering is de
stroyed and the poor caterpillars stop in,
perplexity. But they doubtless conclude
the savages are right, and the worms are
in debt to them for eight weeks of feed
ing, so they start soon to the spinning of
the silk.
The natives are now in ecstacy. They
make the worms hustle around them as
they have been taught during all their lit
tle lives, and spinning as they go the fine
filaments of shining silk. Round and round
crawl the worms, each one spinning one
to four thousand yards of silk thread
around the swarthy, savage neck, around
each naked arm, around the chest and ab
domen and the lower limbs. The work of
the worm is over.
And the result is a remarkable trans
formation! From a nude savage figure,
loathsome and repulsive, with thousands
of yellow worms crawling, twisting, writh
ing, squirming, to a conquering, proud na
tive of Brazil, clothed In a perfectly fitting
garment of rich silk. He has toiled not.
neither has he splnnedâ he has only
bossed the jobâ yet is he clothed in rai
'rnent as beautiful as the lilies of the field.
What a feeling of supremacy he must
have. He has Interfered successfully with
a divine plan. He has turned aside the
course of nature and stands erect, in his
own mini, at least, a man to be greatly
admired.
I was told the first efforts to produce
these garments of silk, were not success
ful. But by patience and perseverance
the faults were corrected, a close web
perfected, and the garment, when com
pleted, was pretty and faultless. It is a
great country for dye stuffs, and the silk
garments were given various brilliant
colors. One old girl was quite a sight.
She was extremely gaunt and bony. Her'
black body was attired in a blood red silk
garment, covering her body from the bust
to just above the knees. There were
dainty green shoulder straps, and around
her stringy neck was a wide ribbon of
bright blue. A savage chief gloried In a.
comfortable silk jacket. It was looser
than the others and could be opened in
front, having a row of little holes in either
side, in which little silk ribbons had been
placed to tie the two sides together. These
holes had been made in an ingenious way.
The noble chief bad a swelling like a
wart 'on his neck, caused by a drop of
poison from a certain weed. He noticed
the worms avoided this wart, and the
result was a hole in the garment. Now,
during all the rest of that summer and
winter, having nothing better to do, the
chief gave his great Intellect to the con
templation of the silkworms and the
royal garment they would make for him.
When the eggs were hatched the foUcv
ing year, and the Indian wa3 covered with
the yellow, hairy caterpillar, he caused
to crow a double row of warts down his
chest by means of the noison from the
weed, and also by the same means a long
welt from neck to waist In the exact cen
ter. When the caterpillars spun out the
silk they avoided the warts and turned
back at the welt. The result was a sar
ment, open In front, with neatlv worked
holes for the ribbons.
When our party left this interesting peo
ple they were busy with plans for further
utilizing the worms. It was ieclded in
the silkworm council that when they had
more worms than they themselves could
use they would put a few hundred upon
the 'heads and necks of some prisoners
taken in battle. The hands and feet would
be tied. The prisoner. would not be able
to move. Only day by day and week by
week the worms would crawl over his
face and neck and slowly, so that the
thought of it would almost drive him ln
sane, a silken hood would-be spun and a
lingering death by suffocation would en
sue. It was further decided that whea
one of their own number died, If he died
at the proper time, the worms should be
given the task of inclosing the corpse in
a silk cocoon, a white one for babies and,
a black one for the men and women.
I tun anticipating another trip to this
tribe, and am curious to see what further
impiovements they have made. I ar. pre
pared for surprises. It would be Interest-
Ing to .Americans if some of these silk
living fashion plates could be brought to
this country and exhibited. They are a
home-loving people, and it would be a
hard matter to set them to leave home,
but to. use a motto that these natives of
Brazil might appropriately adopt, "All
things are possible."
She had leaned forward a little, keep
ing a nervously busy pencil making non
sense lines as she talked. For a second
I thought I saw something like a crow's
foot in the corner of her snappy, reddish
brewn eye, then she leaned back quickly
She laughed her warm little laugh.
"Dear no," she cried. "I have left the
stage for good. Don't you believe me?*'
"Well, you know how often people of
your profession retire for good."
"But I have held to my resolve for eight
years."
"And does the old fascination never get
bold of you?"
"Sometimes. When it does I go to the
theater and have the pleasure of seeing
others act."
"Some San Franciscans are hoping that
you have returned to make another debut
in our midst."
She sank back a little farther Into the
delicious ness of the willow chair, but she
did not seem to feel lazy. â¢ The morning
was crisp and she was crisper. Way back
in the chair there were more shador.is.
"Not at all. The reason that I am not
seeing people is my mother's illness. I
came here on that account, you know, and
I an, here In the best place in the world
to nurse her back to health. She is 81
years old."
"You are good to see me."
She was fitting where the light did not
strike her face and she kept the seat
very closely during our talk. It was not
until she went to the door with me that
I saw her face in strong light, and it was
Â«mly then that I could believe the ac
curacy of her frankly given dates.
When the guardian returned she was
still more charming, but, "Miss Cr&btree
has retired from public life now and the
brief interviews that she granted upon
her arrival she considers sufficient."
For the protection of both tiie guar
aian and the princess I am not, going to
tell to what argument they finally yielded.
The yielding took so long and was so re
luctant that when I faced Miss Crabtree
it was with trepidation. For I did not
know the philosophy of her. Having at
last consented to see me, she was not
going to do it with a bad grace. By no
means. She was as delightful about it
as if it were still worth her while

more now to her overfull pocket than to
that of a Vanderbilt. â¢

then, and I waited on the veranda bench

pedigree.
That was rather thin, for it would be
as hard for any one In that cottage to
escape unseen by other occupants as for
a canary from a cage. However, the
jruardian made a brave stand and was
very charming about it into the bar-

her. She slipped in as slyly as a mouse
into a pantry, and when the Postmaster

She is guarded like a princess in a castle.
And this is the same Lotta whom pioneer
miners welcomed with showers of gold
nuggets, and for whom, later on, man
agers a country over clamored as the
onJy attraction that could nil a house in
Lent. She couldn't have sneaked unknown
into any town then, and she wouldn't
have tried to. Then the *nd the. public
sought each other. Now they have parted'
and she is merely a tourist in California,
seeking health for her mother.
At the door of the tiny brown cottage
I Vv'as looked upon dubiously.
"I don't know whether she is In," the
guardian cf the princess said.
Moreover, although he makes the foun
tain at Kearny and Market his head
quarters every time he comes to San
Francisco, he didn't know who Lotta was
or who Miss Crabtree was, or who Mips
Carlotta Crabtree was. That Is the pity
of it. He thought I might mean Lottie

away long ago, or perhaps I meant Mr.
Lotte. who has a farm somewhere.

dow, but noâ portraits."
"What on earth. do you do with your

her. She is so busy every minute, even
while she Is sitting still; her hands move
and her tongue wags and her face plays.

than you can of a healthy brown spar

"It wasn't until I was 16 that I made
my New York debut. Niblo's Garden
was the place. I was pretty proud, of
course, when I had a New "York success
for the first time."

at the last minute that there was not a
foot of rope in the theater. Properties
and property men were not perfected
then. Shows were more impromptu. So
as I stood upon the stage imagine my
feelings when I heard the shrieks of:
'"How dare you grab my ankle? You
are pulling it! I'll tell my,husband!'
He and Mrs. Saunders, blessed old peo
ple of the old school, have both a joggla
in their voices now. But as for Lotta,
although she says she has declared off,
it looks dubious. For Lotta is still sassy.
I am likewise charged with those of
Barton Hill. "I played with her in what
she called 'The Firefly,' " he said the
other day, "and a curious fact to me la
that during the present fad for 'Under
Two Flags' no one has mentioned that
they are one and the same. In Lotta'3
version she took the part of Cigarette,
or The Firefly, as she called it; but It
was a similar dramatization of tho sama
novel. So the present fashionable play
In New York is really a revival, after
all."

don't know how welcome I might be

Lotta will find very few of the old-thnÂ«
professionals here to reminisce with her.
Mrs. Elizabeth Saunders Is living out on
Capp street "Dear, dear, is Lotta back?"
she said when I told her. "I was Sarah
Gamp to her Marchioness at the old Cali
fornia. I can't remember anything about
the performance except that she sat oa
a table and gnawed a bone. But I re

the fertile valley of the River Thamss.

and the flying snow subsided, when every

rumbling, grinding roar which told the

a thousand points may start the slide
which will smother, break, grind and car

The town of Silver Plume is known to
almost every tourist who has visited the
State of Colorado. It Is hemmed in by
steep mountains at the upper end of the
famous Georgetown' loop on the Colorado
Southern Railway.
The winter of 1S38-99 was severe, and
a large amount of snow had fallen and
was oiled in j vast drifts on the steep
mountain sides above Silver Plume. The
unusual .amount of snow and consequent
danger of slides had alarmed 'the inhabi
tants to such an extent that the authori
ties had ordered the frame schoolhouse
located at the upper end of the town at
the mouth of Cherokee Gulch abandoned
until the danger was past.
On February 12, 1SS9. a strong wind-
Storm started and continued all night.
Sunday morning it somewhat abated, but
the wind was still whirling the light snow
about - the mountain tops in fantastic
forms and adding weight to the already
overburdened combs. of snow arid ice that
hung threateningly over the gulch. ' The
sky was clear, however, and the ,8un/

thousand feet into the air. On Its side
just below timber line.. is the Homestake
mine; 'one of. the first heavy*- producers of
the district. Just above the mine is a
small lake, formed, by a bench of eroded
rock. In the shadow of a gigantic bowl
der, at -the bottom of this bench, three
cabins -.were located, used as ' storehouse
and. living- quarters by the eleven men
who,' provisioned for the winter, were
working the mine. ,y. ...
Eight days later another slide occurred
a couple of miles farther up. the canyon,
at Brown's Gulch, killing three miners'
and injuring live others.-
At almost the same instant another
slide started furtner up the. srulch. be
tween tne Pelican and Seven-Thirty
mines. It wrecked most of the mine build-
Ings and cabins, grinding the huge logs
of which they were constructed into shv
ers. . In these two slides ten persons lost
their lives, and $50,000 worth of ore ready
for shipment -was lost: ...
SupejtfnteEdent Robinson of the Pelican
mine was 'Â¦ standing near the shafthouse
when the slide occurred. Breakfast : was
just over, and several of the miners were
standing about their cabins below. Mr..
Robinson was idly watching them when
he noticed a peculiar movement of j the
great mass of snow high oh the mountain
side. Before he could givo an alarm the
avalanche had reached the cabins, sweep
ing them 'with their, occupants to the bot
tom of the valley below.

miles long and 500 feet wide, and piled the

0<CE of the most common Questions
asked by tourists on the railroad
trains which labor through the
canyons and over the passes of tne
Great Divide is the cause of the
l>are streaks on the mountain sides, where
k spaces of varying width have been cleared
of timber, bowlders, everything which
protruded above the surrounding surface,
making a path as distinct and clean cut
cm the sides as if some Titan of the hills
had drawn a mammoth rake from peak
to base.
The explanation that it was caused by
a snowslide answers the question and
K-cms, no doubt, commonplace enough to
I the tourist. Those who leave the rails
and fare over the mountain roads an=l
trails during the summer months grow to
have a certain respect for the mighty
Icrce that can strip tbe side of a. moun
tain and pile up timber and stone in the
valley below sufficient to warm a city's
houses and to pave a city's streets % but
the man who really- appreciates the
strength and destructiveness of a snow
slide is he who from choice of circum-
sttnees remains in the mountains through
the cycle of the seasons â the man who
sees nature's wheels go round. She in I
her strenuous moods takes to the moun
tains tt>,work off her superfluous energy;
. phe reaches the extreme in everything;
her rains are cloudbursts; her heat makes
the seething air visible; her snows' and
winds blind and overwhelm.

amcunt of provisions consumed, Febru

One of the worst snowslldes that ever
occurred in Colorado, so far as loss of urj
is concerned, was at a little station calUd,
Woodstock, on the South Park Railway.
Woodstock was nine miles east of Pitkm
and near the famous Alpine tunnel, whlca
was completed that year, 1SS4.
In the Pitkin district and on the saci*
day. March 10, twenty-two lives were lost

consisted of the station, postpfflce, section

was seventeenâ nine men, two women and
six children.
â¢ Hiirh above the little cluster of honsea
â¢was a narrow gorge. Above this the snow
started from opposite sides of the moun
tain at almost the same instant. The two
slides mâ¢ and, pouring through tha
gorge, spread over the gulch bÂ«low
caUKht up the frail cabins and hurled
them with several hundred yards of rall
ioad track, rocks, timber and snow, to
the bottom of the canyon.
A riÂ»cue party from Pitkin worked
heroically for two days and nights befora
all of the victims of the slide were ac
counted for. Three of the number werÂ«
found alive and recovered from their In
Â¦juries.
, The railroad man. like the small boy and
the inebriate, is evidently under the- pro*

SAN ANTONIO, May 4.â The sixth
N day of the President's long jcur
ney brought him to San Antonio.
The Presidential train arrived at
2:35 this morning and was side
tracked until daylight Guards
surrounded the train to keep the curious
from disturbing the sleep of the party.
Another special train with Governor
Bayres and his staff aboard escorted the
Presidential train from Austin to San
Antonio and arrived fifteen minutes later.
Both trains were sidetracked in the yard.
The President and fall party were escort
ed from the depot in carriages to Fort
Sam Houston In the early morn-ing hours,
passing through the city and viewing a
number of its myriads of beautiful natural
and artificial parks.
At Travi* Park he was rreeted by hun
dreds of public school children In white,
singing patriotic Eongs and waving tiny
American flags. This park Is named in
honor of Colonel Travis, who figured
prominently in early Texas history and
lost his life In the ill-fated Alamo mis-
Elon on March 6. 1S3S. when Santa Anna's
horde of Mexicans overpowered and mas
sacred the small garrison of Texans.
Fort Sam Houston.
At Fort Sam Houston the Presidential
party was met by General Chambers Mc-
Klbbln, commander of the Department of
Speaks at Del Rio
While the Engines

dress Governor Sayres in behalf of the
citizens of San -Antonio presented to Mr.
McKinley a magnificent oil painting of
the Alamo. The President then visited
the. Alamo and wrote his signature on the
register, signing "William McKinley."
Received by Ladies.
The party then proceeded to the Menger
Hotel, where the ladies of the party had
preceded them and where the ladies of
San Antonio were holding an informal re
ception. The President was there intro
duced and shook hands with the assem
bled multitude.
. The city Is elaborately decorated In red,
white and, blue, and the blooming spring
flowers in yards and parks helped to
make the scene enchanting and to give
the President an idea of what to expect
in sunny California.

The President, although showing, traces
of .fatigue, bears up wonderfully well un
der the severe strain of six days on the
road. Constant hurrahing, and handshak
ing, speech-making, dining and banquet
ing Is calculated to fatigue a stronger
man than the President.' j He is ' looking
forward to a grateful rest at. El' Paso.
There will be no exercises and no attempt
at entertainment whatever, the President
and 'Mrs. McKinley remaining, quietly at

Fort Sani Houston is the second largest

On the return from the post the Presi
dent was officially welcomed . to the city
of^San Antonio, the ceremonies taking
place in the historic old Alamo Place,
where a grand stand had been erected.
Mayor Hicks delivered the address of
welcome and President McKinley respond
ed. He alluded freely to the enthusiastic
welcome and closed by declaring: that he
and his associates would always . have
cause to "remember the Alamo. He said:
I. was grlad to know and cannot describe my
satisfaction at the response that great State
of Texas made at the call of the executive for
troops for the Spanish war. You filled more
than your quota and thousands crowded to
get Into the service to help freeman oppressed

PORT TOWNSEND, May 4.â Owing to
the limited time of the visit of the party
here the people of Port Townsend will
not attempt to give much of a reception.
According to the plans of the committee,
it has been arranged that the Mayor will
welcome the President in a speech of fif
teen or twenty words, and.it has been
suggested that some little child present
him with a bouquet of rhododendrons,
.\f r ,_ whIch - If time permits, the party
will be driven to Morgan Hill!
Arrangements should be made so that
when the steamer carrying the Presiden
tial party rounds Marrowstone Point a
salute be fired from all' three forts At
present there are no soldiers stationed at
Port Worden on Point Wilson, but It Is
thought that a squad of men from either
Forts Flagler or Casey could be sent over
for that purpose. The firing of a salute
to the President from each fort would be
more effective than just one of the tri
angular system of forts firing.
By the time the President arrives rho
dodendrons will be at their, best and it is
desired that the entire city be decorated
with the State flower, which of itself
would not fail to make an impression on

LONDON, May 4.â The Pope, ac
cording to a dispatch to the Times
from Rome, is understood to have
made a â¢ will designating his suc

choosing a Pope by a conclave.
The news â¢ of the Pope's will first took
shape in a diplomatic note. from the Ba
varian Minister to his favorite. Its theory
is simple. The papal power, being absolute,
involves the right of naming a successor.
Dealing witl^ the rumors of Cardinal
Rampolla's retirement from the office of
Secretary of State, the correspondent says
that Rampolla is aiming for the tiara and
that if the Pontiff died to-day the strug

SOUTHAMPTON, May 4.â The trial of
I Shamrock II to-day had a rather unfor
i tunate conclusion, for she went ashore on
j a bank close to the Warner lightship. The
j trial' was practically over and she came
i sharp around the lightship to return to
j her moorings, when she grounded on the
sand. The wind was very light at the
time and she slid upon the bank with a
scarcely perceptible shock. There -was
not wind enough to pull her off and the
Erin was signaled to send a launch, but
half an hour elapsed before the launch
came and towed her off without any diffi
culty. ". .: .
Captain Jameson arid Designer -Watson
were both on board Shamrock II . when
she went aground and both are agreed
that the yacht sustained no damage.
There is no intention of docking her. and
there will be no interruption to her trials.
An immense â¢ amount of preparatory
work has been satisfactorily carried out
during the past week and everything es
sential was ready when Shamrock II left
her berth. Sir Thomas Lipton and Charles
Ribell arrived last evening and saw the
last touches put to the preparations. De
signer Watson and Captain Jameson fol
lowed this morning.
Keen interest was shown in the. trial
and a large number of yachts and steam
ers crowded with passengers accompanied'
the Erin and Shamrock II. While the
challenger was preparing for her' first
sail the American line steamer St. Louis
passed her. There were a number of
Americans on board, who closely scanned
the challenger. On passing the yacht the
steamship slowed down and saluted. The
crews of the Erin and the two Sham
rocks, who were ranged on their respect
ive decks, cheered the St. Louis heartily.
During the forenoon the breeze steadied
and hardened under a fine crisp north
easter which was blowing sufficiently to
raise the white caps. Jibs and staysails
of the challengers were hoisted at an
early hour, and when the word was given
to raise the mainsail, the speed weights
with which it was hoisted from the deck
in American fashion .demonstrated the
handiness of the appliances adopted. The
sail is made of dark sea island cotton
and fully justifies the expectation of its
being the largest on 'record. Â¦
After spending a couple of hours slip
ping about in light winds off Cowes, tho
challenger made a long board toward
Ryde. There a fresher wind Was met,
and, going along with all canvas drawing
well, the Shamrock II footed ahead in a
way little short of marvelous. The sweet
ness of her hulls was shown by the
smoothness of her going through the,;
water, and, under to-day's conditions, the Â»
Shamrock II is certainly a marvel in this
respect. The wind In which she passed
Ryde was such as might take her round
an America's cup course just Inside the
time limit, and in. these conditions she
gave a display never-before equaled on
this side of the Atlantic. -

The press comment from both parties,
is extremely cautious, not triumphant.
The Germania promises the Conservatives
the Center's aid, as heretofore, since no
government In Prussia is possible without
the Conservatives. The Deutsche Tages
Zeltung. Post and Kreuz Zeltung dis
creetly praise the Government for avoid
ing defeat on the canal bill by closing the
Diet. The Tagesblatt regrets the closure,
because a number of Important bills are
thus disposed of.
The Voerwaerts ironically congratulates
the Junker party and Centrists upon the
skill displayed in fighting the canal bill
and forcing Emperor William twice upon
his knees. It contrasts this with the un
skillful attitude of the Liberals and Rad
icals, and sarcastically quotes verbatim
Emperor William's pro-canal declaration
of August 11, 1899, in Dortmund, which
"thÂ«s supporters of the crown and altar
have twice turned into a powerless boast."
The Vossische Zeitung believes the new
Prussian Cabinet will be more homogene
ous than hitherto. The papers all devote
farewell articles to Dr. von Mlquel, uni
formly admitting his great ability, espe
cially financially and administratively,
but they point out that everybody had
finally lost confidence In him because of
his extreme cunninnr and Insincerity.
Papers of every shade join i n the chorus.
The events of the last few days have
proved a great sensation, but upon closer
inspection they do not mean a change
in the system. It is quite certain that
neither Emperor William nor Count von
Bulow has the slightest intention to gov
ern with the aid of the Liberals or Radi
cal Left, nor to dissolve the Diet. Whether
the canal bill will bear reappeal is uncer
tain, in spite of the assurances of a high
official. In any case, the bill is buried out
of sight for the time, thus meeting the
Â¦wishes of the Conservatives and agrarian
Centrists.

The interest of the day, however, was on

.Bartlett did. not attempt an elaborate

bullet which was produced at the trial

that the expert placed a private mark on
the bullet, which cannot now be found on

actually took place between the two men
Bartlett said that Eastman was examin

This remedy is composed of simple,

bine so effectively and act bo promptly
and thoroughly that it cures, every form
of : piles, whether < itching, blind, bleeding
or protruding^ In long-standing cases the
Pyramid Pile Cure has proven to be the
only certain cure except a surgical opera-

tion are- many, as it is painless, causes no
delay or interference with , daily occupa-
tion and, last but not least, is, cheaper
than any surgical operation could possibly
be,- costing 50 cents a â¢ package at \ any
drugstore. The . cases .that the Pyramid

physicians are . doing away with opera-
tions â¢ for pile3 â¢ and depending on this
cheap but effective remedy to accomplish
a complete. cure, and it never disappoints
except in cases beyond the reach of medi-
cal ; skill. T.he Pyramid Pile Cure. is pre-
pared by the Pyramid Drug Co. of Mar-
shall; Mich., and for ' sale by druggists
everywhere at 50 cents per. package. Each
package contains a treatise on cause and
cure of .pilts, '. together . with testimonials
from every section of this country.
There are some people who have piles as
regula*ly and frequently as other people
have colds.. Any little bowel trouble will
bring them on, any extra exertion, as- in
lilting, will produce them, and, in fact,
they will often appear .without any appar-
ent provocation. Piles.x however, is much
more serious than: a cold,; as the tendency
is always to grow worse until the trouble
becomes deep seated, and chronic,' or de-
velops Into some. fatal rectal disease. ,..

is trying to get hold of some of the Crooks
wealth.
To-day's proceedings resulted In. little
beyond a vast assortment of objections by
Attorney Johnson. The forenoon was tak
en by the consideration of Â¦ the fate of a
red horse. The horse was the creation of
a hypothetical question, which was ar
gued by referee and attorneys and made
use of to illustrate the admissability of
certain testimony of Mrs. Crooks'.
Mrs. Crooks Refuses to Ans-wer.
"Did you ever see any deeds made by
your husband to you?" she was asked.
Attorney Johnson objected and advised
her not to answer, and she didn't. The
red horse was then argued as an abstract
proposition. , This afternoon the animal
was turned out to pasture and the exam
ination continued.
Mrs. Crooks was called to the stand. She
testified that she had been married eight
years. Her property interests were in
charge of Jeremiah Burke and she did not
know of her husband giving her any
property.
J. J. Crooks was next called to the
stand. â¢ His examination started with ref
erence to 9000 shares of stock in the Tuol
umne County Electric Light and Power
Company. These, it developed, had been
turned over to his wife two or three
months ago. ;â¢ The witness testified that
during, the last two or three years he had
borrowed between $110,000 and $150,000 from
Mrs. Crooks and that he had placed this
stock in the safe deposit for her. He told
how he had borrowed sums varying from
$10 000 to $50,000 from her at different -times
as thoush the amounts were merely car
fares. When Mullaney pressed the ques
tions it was further developed that
Crooks now owns no real estate: that all
of his' property " has been- deeded to his
wife by a deed drawn in 1897 by Plaintiff
Grant, who at that time was his attorney.
Mullaney also took a fling at Prince Poci
atowskl. ..'Â¦Â¦f~i'f-
"Do you know a Poniatowskl, sometimes
called 'Prince?' " inquired Mullaney.
Concerning a Marble Quarry.
The Prince and others had leased the
marble quarry from Crooks and Paul R,
Jarboe, the defendants. Further question
ing on this subject was headed off by an
objection. The witness was next asked
If he had deeded his New York property.
This his attorney objected to and, though
Referee . Towle ordered it answered.
Crooks, on the advice of his attorney, re
fused to answer. When asked if he owned
any property at all Crooks sarcastically
replied: s
"Yes; I own an equity of redemption in
a valuable marble quarry in Tuolumne
County." ' V ~ -
This washis.fiins at Grant. In conclu
sion Mullaney said:
"So, Mr. Crooks, you are thoroughly,
teetotally and completely bankrupt?"
Attorney Johnson here objected to the
language and for the time being the ex
amination concluded, f
Mullaney asked the referee ( to refer
back to Judge Nicol of "Tuolumne Coun
ty the questions that Crooks refused to
answer and get his ruling as to whether
they were proper or not. For this pur
pose the examination was continued for
three -weeks, by which time Judge Nicol
will have been heard from. If he holds
the questions goodâ and there are about
200 of themâ Mr. and Mrs.' Crooks will
have to answer or be punished for con

Lorenzo Van Geisen Invites
Death by Attacking a,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATJBTJRX, May 4.â Lorenzo Van Geisen,
a pioneer resident, was shot and killed this
morning near his home at Clipper Gap by
"Indian Ed." The Indian came to Auburn
after the shooting and gave himself into
the custody of Sheriff Keena. He refused
to say anything further than that he fired
in self-defense.
William Ragsdale, the only eyewitness
to the shooting, gave the authorities an
account of the tragedy and the causes
leading up to it. He had lost a cow, and
with "Indian Ld." who works for him.
started on horseback in search of ner.
They had traced the animal to Van Gei
sen's ranch. Van Geisen came out with
rifle in hand and ordered them to move on.
They started to go, when Van Geisen lev
eied his rifle at Kagsdale. The Indian re
sented this, jumping from his horse and
taking the weapon away from Van Geisen.
Ragsdale and' the Indian then started
homeward, but had not gone far when
Van Geisen overtook them. After the ex
change of a few words the Indian fired a
shot from the rifle, killing Van Geisen in
stantly. Van Geisen fell from his -horse,
and when he was picked up a cocked pis
tol lay by his eida.
Van Geisen and Ragsdale have been at
enmity for years, and the Indian and Van
Gtisen had had trouble. An Indian named
Dick of Auburn said to-day that "Indian
Ed" had told him that he and Van Geisen
Â¦would have trouble some day. It seems
that Van Geisen had accused the Indians
of killing hogs and cattle in the neighbor
hood. Â¦
Attorney A. K. Robinson of this city has
been retained by the defendant, and it is
predicted that a long and bitter trial will
result. "Indian Ed" was born in Placer
County and is a half-breed. Van Geisen
was a single man, about 50 vears of age.
A brother lived with him. He was a rep
utable citizen, as is Ragsdale. The latter
believes Van Geisen followed him with the
intention of shooting him.

EMPLOYER'S FOE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Â¦ LOS ANGELES. May 4.â Considerable
apprehension is expressed in some quar
ters that General Harrison Gray Otis has
commandeered the programme committee
Jor the McKinley reception and is to have
things pretty much his own way, which
means, say the fearful, that General Otis
will make the best of the opportunity
to glorify himself and to punish his ene
mies. Even the Governor of the State is
to be snubbed unless some consmitteemen
may yet assert themselves and declare
that the chief executive of the State is
not to be wholly sidetracked.
To-day the programme committee does
not know whether Governor Gage will or
will not be in Los Angeles when the
President comes. Others know that the
Governor and other State officers will,
in a private car provided by the South
ern Pacific, go to the frontier at Yuma
to meet the Presidential party and will
follow the train into Los Angeles.
According to the diagram of ths col
umn formation of the parade from the
Arcade station to the hotel no provision
Is made for a carriage for Governor Gage.
General Otis, in one of his usual Â¦"con
sultations" with the programme commit
tee, made a "FUggrestion" as to the proper
formation cf the column. With military
form he drew a diagram showing, after
a platoon of police, the President's car
riage, flanked on either side by twelve
members of the Loyal Legion. Then, at
Intervals of "ten paces." were carriages
for the Cabinet and other members of
the party. Then, according to the Otis j
plan, the Grand Army of the Republic
Â¦svould follow.
But not a word about the Governor!
Brigadier General Last, who is to be
marshal of the parade, wants to know
"who'n'rll is running the show." He had
promised the Grand Army men that they
should lead the column.
Chairman Ferd K. Rule was asked to
day what disposition was to be made of
Governor Gasre.
"We hP.ve no nd vices that he will be
here at all." said Mr. Rule. "We did get
Â¦information that he did not intend to be
present, so we made no provision for him.
."When Mr. LeashUa and I meet the Presi
dent r.t Rcdlands we will find out if the
Governor is to be here, and if so we will
wire to the the committee to have a car
riage for Mm."
General Otis Ignores the Ex
ecutive in Reception

HARRIMAN PREFERS RATHER TO ACT
THAN POSE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS
THE features of Edward H. Harri
man, who is looked upon as the
successor of the late Collis P.
Huntlngton In railroad matters in
California, are not as familiar to
the general public as those of the recently
deceased president of the Southern Pacific
Company. Â¦ * Â¦ . ,
Collis P. Huntington was not averse to
posing before the camera, and it was of
ten possible for an artist j to sketch the
famous financier and secure , a striking
portrait. Mr. Huntington would often ac
commodate newspaper artists and spare
some of his valuable time for a "sitting:."
Not so. however, with Mr. Harriman. He
has declared many times that he will not
be s, subject for the man "who snaps the
shutter." and that his time is too valu
able to allow him to sit in repose long
enough for an artist to transfer his fea
tures tq paper.
Harriman. however, has been conquered
by a disciple of the - kodak. ' Recently,
Â¦when the railroad magnate and financier
was driving- near his stock farm at Tux
edo, N. T., he was "shot at" with a kodak
camera, and a striking picture was se
cured. The photo printed herewith is the
first of Mr. Harriman ever published on
the Pacific Coaost.
Edward H. Harriman ranks to-day as
one of the powerful pillars in the worlds

SAN JOSE, May 4.â Charles F. Crill of
Kansas Is tiring of his restraint and, to
make It more so. for Mr. Crill, comes the
resolution of Sheriff Langford this after
noon to take the suspect' off exhibition
and confine him in a cell. Everybody :1s
about satisfied that "Crill is Crill,". and
the callers to see him diminished consid
erably to-day. Â«
Soimo strong: evidence was, brought out
this afternoon to show that the- suspect
had passed a winter with his uncle, David
R. Crill, at Flagg Station, 111., as he said
he had some twenty years ego. , Mrs. C.
L. Fosgute, who as Miss Jennie Leonard
had -been raised there, but la now a-rest
dent of Alvlso, called at the Jail and ques
tioned Crill as to the people of Flagg Sta
tion. These questions he answered with
out any hesitation ' and mentioned 'many
Incidents of which no one else could have
known. Mm Fosarate was well acquaint
ed with his uncle, and to her he described
the uncle â a short, old man, with bald
head and no beard, and who lived In the
biggest house in the town. His descrip
tion satisfied Mrs. Fosgate, and she was
fully convinced Crill had been there, when
the conversation turned to the Glass fam
ily, whom Crill mentioned.' The question
er knew Bessie Glass, and when Crill
mentioned "the eirl no one ever saw,"'
Mrs. Fossate was sure the man she was
talking to was none other than the Char
lie , Crill she had heard and seen at
Flagg. Station. She said thaf David R.
Crill and wife, who were wealthy, had no
children, and when the nephew came there
to make his home gossip In the little burg
had declared he would be the heir to the
estate. Mrs. â¢ Fosgate declared that he
was there at the time he claimed to be, or
he would have known nothing of Jennie
Glass, the hiding girl, of whom they had
spoken. This girl, who was in her teens,
was . shy and would never see any one.
When a person approached the house
she would run and hide. Crill' s caller
had been an Intimate friend of the fam
ily, yet she "had never been near enough
to the girl to speak to her. Very few
knew there was such a member of the
Glass family.
Everett Snell. who saw and spoke to
Dunham above Smith Creek thirty-six
hours after the crime, called at the Jail
to-day. He did not believe Crill was Dun
ham, although he would not say posi
tively. .
This morning Crlll received the follow
ing letter from Mrs. Firman at Santa

of any help to you let us know, we are very

MRS. HELEN FIRMAN.
Santa Cruz. May 3, 190L
District Attorney Campbell has advised
Sheriff Langford to still hold Crill, as he
is hot convinced the man is not Dunham.
As soon as Crill is confined In a cell it is
believed he will demand his release
through his attorney. No charge has yet
been- placed against him, and it will then
be necessary to either arraign him or let
him go. Â« .'"
The fact that there Is a supposed Dun
ham here in Jail has not stopped the am
ateur detectives Â¦. 4n -. their, hunt for the
Campbell murderer.^- To-day two- more
suspects were reported to the Sheriff. One
is herding sheep iir Oregon and the other
one In the South... <The . man arrested at
Talledaga, Ala., was; ordered released to
â¢Mrs". J. A. Fisher, of 1S5 North Ninth
street of this city, who lived at- Flagg
station . when CrUl was there, positively
identified Crill this evening. Mrs. Fisher
carried with her half a dozen photographs
of persons living at Flagg station twenty
years ago. . These were shown Crill, one
at a time, and in each instance he told
the names of the originals. -
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.

. Â«I was a great sufferer two year* ago with
female trouble and I wrote to yon for advice,"
says Mrs. Mattie Hays, of Tribulation, McDonald
Co., Missouri. "You outlined a course of treat-
ment for me. ' I followed your directions, and
now feel like a different â¢ person. - I . never
expected to hear from you when I wrote to you.
In three days after I commenced taking your
medicines I began to feel better. I took twenty
dollars' worth of the ' Favorite Prescription '
and ' Golden Medical Discovery.' I bought it
five dollars' worth at a time, and also four vials
of Dr. Pierce's Pellets. I would not take one
thousand dollars for the good the medicine has
done me. Â¦ I can't praise it enough. I 'wish all
who suffer with such troubles would give Dr.
Pierce's medicines a fair trial. I can work all
dayâ doing anything, walk where I please, and
feel good, i Many thanks to you for your kind

BpeCIal Dispatch to The CalL
VICTORIA. B. C. May 4.â Peter Dow,
an old prospector, and party have re
turned to Dawson after two years in the
Tan&na country, with a story of a won
derful- cuartz discovery west of the Tul
vana Jtlver. Dow says of the find:
"From the summit, looking down the
etreoia. we could seÂ« for In the distance a
huee range of mountains, higher than any
In the vicinityâ immense crags and bluffs,
covered with what seemed to be a fresh
fallen mantle of snow. They appeared to
bÂ© about one hundred miles distant, and
the raage seemed fully that extent in
lengths For four days we traveled to
ward the white mountains, determined to
uncertain whether or not that which we
eaw was white snow or pure white quartz.
The <S*y before we reached the mountains
wo could see the character of them by the
character of the float which covered the
bed of ' the creek. It was fairly covered
with broken pieces of white porphyric
quartz. From a distance of several miles
could be seen huge veins of rose quartz
from ten to thirty leet thick running along
the side of the mountain and traceable for
hundreds of feet.
"This range lies on the north side of the
river and runs from east to west, connect
ing: on the north Â¦with black granite and
on the east with blue slate. We tested
EDme of the Quartz and found traces of
every piece handled with such
crude tools as we had with us. We re
mained here two days, during which time
I climbed up the range probably 1000 feet
to the first bench. From that point I
could eee on the summit above pinnacles
of pure white auertz 200 to 300 feet high,
pointing straight up Into the air and look
ins for all the world like so many church
esteeples. There were also several natural
.^rches. bo perfect In detail that it seemed
es though they had been carved out by
hand.
I "The Cay, we started back for our camp
â¢we heard a shot fired while on the summit
of a small divide we were crossing, and a
ehort time afterward came upon two men
who had been lost. They had been out
In the mountains four days and had sub
sisted entirely upon berries.
"I believe that the range of white moun
tain? is one enormous mass of mineral
and will prove a source of wealth almost
beyond belief. Quite a number of old
timers In Circle are going to prospect that
section this season, and you must not bo
â¢surprised If you hear of some extraor
dinary rich quartz strikes being made
curing- the summer."

"THE SPY"â This is a rattling little
melodrama, with plenty of local color
(time of the war in La Vendee), action
and a climax that requires only a little
lengthening to be extremely effective. It
calls for a chorus of five or six men and
a young lady armed with two qualifica
tions raro in an amateurâ a good soprano
voice and capability of shooting -off a pis
tol without hitting the leader of the or
chestra. Any gentle maiden who, is sure
that, by diligent practice, she can acquire
these qualifications may dssay this play
wltHVssurar.ce of success.
"THE WIFE'S CONFESSION"â This, it
seems to me, is the best play in the book.
It turns upon a probable Incident of every
day lifeâ a girl's forgetting to destroy
somo of her love lettersâ and Is worked
out with considerable dramatic ingenuity.
Tho lady's pert Is one of purÂ© sentiment.
Of the two men one must be able to por
tray a cool-headed man of the trorld who
is first and last a gentleman; the other
must also be a gentleman, but very youth
ful nnd impulsive. With the exception of
"The Charm" I consider this the most dif
ficult play in the book, but the most ef
fective if well done.

As a pianistic Miss Wertheim
er*s programme was' hardly a success
from the standpoint of interest and va
riety, and her numbers I judge hardly to
have been the happiest mediums for the
exercise of the young lady's faculty. The
Concertstueck was ruined in the accom
paniment, which overbalanced the solo
piano with disastrous effect, but yet left
evident the fact that Miss Wertheimer. is
a pianist of unusual attainments and of
even more remarkable promise. She Is
young, and her attitude toward Â¦ her art
Is that of a student rather than a mas
ter; but she has a delightful touch an<S
tone, a musicianly spirit, a clean tech
nique, forceful and sufficient, and is alto
gether a welcome addition to the ranks
of our musicians. The only discernible
lack in her equipment is a somewhat ae
fldent rhythmic sense. - â¢.
John R. L<ewis is a pupil of Henry Hey
man, and is a decidedly gifted boy. He
has a charmingly sympathetic tone, a
broad and -artistic conception, and is
studying hard to add to his already con
siderable technical, skill. . â¢ Mr. Lewis! ren
dering of the Rles "Romanze" was par
ticularly enjoyed. Oscar Frank improves
steadily; he has a very good mezzo voce./
One good result of the Henschel Influ
ence was apparent at the recital of mod
ern classics given the .other evening at
Sherman & Clay Hall by Miss Grace Bar
ker Marshall and Bert Georges. It is the
admirable Henschel custom to print (and
translate) the words of all their Bongs
for their recital progi^ammes, thus adding
sensibly to the pleasure of the perform
ance, and this was done the other evening
with pleasing result.
. The modern song classics given by Mr.
Georges included three very picturesque
and dramatic songs by Francis Korbay,
"There Was None to Match Kerekes,"
"Mourning in- the Village Dwells" and
"Shepherd, See Thy Horse's Foaming
Mane"; a Loewe number, also both dra
matic and passionate, "Edward," writ
ten about one of the old Percy's Reliques;
"Light" and "Life and Death." by Neld
linger; the "Song of Sir Giles," Wllby;
"Old Winter Comes," by Woodman, and
a White song, "Marching Along."
Mr. Georges is at his best In the robust
and dramatic element, and his work
shows distinct progress since his appear
ance, last year. It yet lacks smoothness
and <3epth, sentiment, but Mr. Georges'
voice is valuable and the things needful
are all his with study and time. - .
Miss Marshall's contributions were the
Rachmaninoff "Prelude,", the "Spinning
Wheel" -of Â¦Â¦Pachul&kl and three move
ments from a new Foote suite on qua
trains from the Rubaiyat; all' very inter
esting numbers, but the young pianist's
Interpretations were Immature, superficial
in conception, blurred in outline and with
out technical clarity. Her accompani
ments to Mr. Georges* songs were much
better and it is quite possible that ner
vousness may have been largely, respon
sible for the indifferent quality of the
solo work.

FROM Chicago come. reports of a new discussion in sociology, strange in its nature, but not
surprising in its results. It appears that for some time past v the male wage-earners have
been troubled by the competition of women; and out of their discussions on the subject
there arose a suggestion that the best remedy, for the evil would be to marry off the competing
girls. The plan found so much favor that according to one report it has been proposed that every
labor union have an "official match-maker," whose duty it will be to "eliminate competition in the
trade by. getting some young man to marry any girl who enters it. Upon that proposition the
debate is now going on. . :-^|{^'- Â¦ . .._ -
As might have (been expected/ such a proposal from the men has been met" with some coy
ness by the ladies. In fact the ladies believe the plan to be an inadequate remedy for the evil. The
Chicago Tribune quotes an officer of a woman's union as saying: "I have known of. several cases
of marriage between co-workers, and the unwillingness of. the' bride to quit her remunerative em
ployment usually did not meet with the strenuous opposition of the gallant husband. The usual
result was that either both remained in their former positions or that the husband "quit and let the
woman earn the salary. A woman is more eager to work than a man, and when you find a married
woman drawing a large salary as schoolteacher, stenographer, or in any other position, generally you
will discover a husband attached who is engaged in speculation, playing the races, or other occupa
tion where the greater part of his labor is disposing of his. wife's salary."
Lest she might be suspected of. opposing matrimony itself, of of taking unjust views of hus
bands, the lady went on to say: "Marriage between employes. of the same firm, engaged in differ
ent occupations, are common and' usually happy, and I understand that the , same can be said of
those between competing employes in the great textile mills of the Eastern and Southern States,
but I don't commend this idea of commercial matrimony." - Â¦ -
That is the woman's side of it. The men say they have known v a good many women to be re
tired from,the army of workers by marriage, and they insist the scheme is excellent. It is to be
hoped the experiment will be given a fair trial. Chicago has; furnished the country with so many
problems that she owes it to herself to solve one or two/ andlthis is : a good one to. begin with.
.A CHICAGO DISCUSSION.
"THE GLOVE"â This Is a capital play if
you like the "More Than Queen" style
clothes and little more. It is set in cav
alier times, thereby giving the lady a
chance for a stunning gown and the gen
tlemanâthere are only two prominent
partsâ an opportunity for black velvet,
ls.ee and ruffles. Many pecple like this
kind of thing and many a play has hob
bled to success on the crutches .of cos
tume and scenery. The sentiment of the
piece turns on loyalty to that gtx>d-for
nothing rake Charles n, and 'twould,
therefore, be hard to make". It go down
with an American audience, I think, un
less that audience happened to be com-
"THE SHRINKING SHOE*,'â This tea
feeble attempt to tell, in terms of evening
dress and 5 o'clock tea. a story that seems
a combination of Cinderella and Ulysses
on the island of Circe. But the sentiment
is so bald and the construction so obvi
ous that the result is simply fatuous. "Oh.
that mine enemy would write a" book!"
cried ' the criticized poet. that he
would play Geoffrey Annlger in \ "The
Shrinking Shoe!' " say I, and that-I might
be there to take notes. Â¦
"LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE'?â This
Is a heart-breaking little play, with a
happy conclusion illogically tacked on. It
calls for one man who can do serious, pa
thetic work; the lady's part and that of
the two subordinate men present no diffi
culties. To get the maximum effect out
of this playâ which is really a little trag
edyâthe happy conclusion should be cut
out and the logical, tragical conclusion
written in. , If your object be merely to
amuse your friends, this is a good play to
avoid.
"PEER AND HEIRESS"â This calls for
two young men who do not need to be
much more than good looking and two
young girls who must have a decided
aroma of Americanism, about them, which
distills itself through an atmosphere of
good clothes, wit and pedagogy. They
must be fascinating enough to make you
believe that two young Englishmen would
ccme three thousand miles to y look for
them, yet not too clever to make you feel
that they might have done better than be
sa'tiffied with the aforesaid Britishers.
The best thing about this little play Is the
easy, natural manner In which the com
plication is brought about; in other words,
the fable is better than the characteriza
tion. Â¦ The reverse is true of "The Charm.".
SCARCELY a week passes but I re
ceive requests from amateurs to
recommend them short plays suit
able, for a drawing-room or a
small hall. It is useless to refer
the Inquirers to French's catalogue, for
this . publication gives only the number
of male or female characters, with no in
dication of the nature of the play. Most
of Mr. Pinero's plays can be procured by
amateurs by addressing his American
agents, W. H. Baker & Co.. Boston. The
royalty is only 510 for each performance.
This fact is little known. I think.' or we
should less seldom see amateur dramat'c
societies delving In the dustheaD of old
fashioned melodramas or stupid farces.
The descriptions of the Plnero plays in
Baker's catalogue can be relied upon ex
cept that which recommends "The Ama
! zons" "to young ladles' schools and col
leges." The three girls in th!3 play havÂ»
to appear 4n men's clothes and that would
not be edifying. I think, for young ladies
in school or college. Other Â» catalogues
there are which describe plays, but all
that I am acquainted with are as unrelia
ble as patent medicine advertisements. In
one of these now before me. for instance,
that inane farce, "London Assurance."
is spoken of as follows: "Its types of
character are marvels of skill. It is per
vaded with a never-failing vein of humor
and it fairly sparkles with wit on every
page." To pack more lies than that into
one sentence would be difficult.
Some time ago I had the pleasure of
speaking favorably of Mrs. Sutherland's
"In Far Bohemia" with the result that
this capital little play was capitally put
upon the stage by one of our local dramat
ic societies. To-day I propose to describe
briefly the eight plays for amateurs con
tained in a book by Besant & Pollock
entitled "The Charm and Other Drawing
room Plays." (Stokes. New York.)
"THE CHARM"â This, the longest and
most difficult play in the book, would re
quire about an hour to act. It- is high
comedy, in the Mollere style, of the most
refined typeâ quiet, subtle and a little arti
ficial. Unless the principal performers are
more than ordinarily intelligent and un
less they are prepared to take time for not
less than fifteen or twenty rehearsals,
they will get only tame effects out of this
charming little work. Many an amateur
play will please if only the ladles .who>
participate are young and beautiful and
will leam to speak their parts well; this
play calls for more than that, since both
the girls in it are required -to appear, in
one scene, as old women. There are two
principal parts for menâ more difficult
even than the two ladles' parts, since they
call for characteristics wherein men are
naturally inferior to womenâ grace of
manner and delicacy of sentiment. There
are three or four little parts, that can be
filled in without difficulty and that will
afford excellent practice for beginners.
"THE VOICE OF, IX) VE"â This is a
better play than its somewhat common
place title would seem to indicate. It con
tains a star role for a young girl and Its
success or its. failure would depend abso
lutely upon her, the two men's parts be
ing very subordinate. The basal Idea of
the play is a pretty and sympathetic oneâ
that of a girl left poor to the guardian
ship of an old actor, who thinks that be
cause she is beautiful and intelligent he
can make an actress out of her. He finds
she lacks one essentialâ passion or feel
ing. How to remedy this? Ah," yes: the
man she has dreamed of in childhood re
turns to her;, this is her Romeo; after, he
has spoken she can act Juliet. But having
heard the voice of real love, she no longer
cares to hear the voice of theatric love.
Art Is nothing, life is everything; the old
man loses his pupil, the stage an orna
ment, but Romeo gains his Juliet.
THE PRESIDENT AND THE. SOUTH.
- â ; : . ;-.'-Â¦â¢ ',.?Â¦: - Â¦ ;_ .â¢' . :; Â¦
T m HE tour of the President through the South marks the passing of the old political and sec
tional order.
From the time of the vindication by John Quincy Adams of the right of petition,
arid Calhoun's system of politics based on the. institution of slavery, the two sections began grow
ing apart. In their systems of education, their social -views, "methods' of business and all, the dis
tance between them began to widen until in the gulf between there was room for the great trag
edy of the Civil War. , ; : & s :>'" : ,
When their railway systems began to develop, every Southern road was built of a different
gauge from the Northern roads, so that all trains had to stop at the border. This proved for
a long time a substantial means of Southern defense in the war, as troop trains could not be. run
across the line until the gauge was changed. Now the President's train starts at Washington
city, runs on the tracks through Virginia, North arid South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee,' Missis
sippi, Louisiana and Texas, passes into New Mexico and Arizona and enters California, to" begin
an equal run through the old North, Ending, every road'of the same gauge, tunnels of the same
capacity, bridges of the same safety, and every facility exactly the same as if the road were all in
one State and under one ownership. But this change is not all that marks the difference between
the old and the new, the past and the. present. The people are no longer -of a different gauge in
respect to their national sentiment. A President from Ohio, from the State of personal liberty
bills, by which the fugitive slave law was nullified, the State of Giddings, Chase and Ben Wade, is
hailed at Vicksburg, New Orleans and Houston with a fervor of patriotism that cannot be excelled
on the Western Reserve. - ..-'.';
The reason need not be sought far. President McKinley has been distinctly non-sectional
in all his actions. In the beginning of his first term he had every excuse for retaliation against sec
tional and partisan attack. Indeed, since Lincoln's day, there was hardly a more pronounced re
crudescence of sectional feeling against a President. The South was to an extent indoctrinated
with financial theories in opposition to all that the President stood for. The South was pinched
and far behind the rest' of the country in progress* and prosperity. The South needed, more than
the North, a fixed and determined adherence, by the National to the principles of
sound money. She needed extension of trade, a restoration of the consuming power of the people.
She needed that prosperity which is the first step to aroused enterprise and progress.
When the President put his hand to 1 the policies that would restore the energies of the
country and the profits of trade, the South expected death, but got life instead. She expected ruin,
but received regeneration. She expected poverty, but was soon clad in the raiment of prosperity.
The President is a statesman and philosopher. He foresaw from -the beginning that end which
must come from the inflexible support of such' public policies as must be the necessary foundation
of general prosperity. He addressed himself immediately to those policies, and stopped neither to
reward nor punish, nor-in any way resent nor notice an opposition that had its "origin in a mis
taken sentiment, and a wrong view of economics and finance. What his mind's eye fashioned as the
future, dimly seen by others five years ago, is the presentâ seen, felt and, enjoyed by all men, and
by none more thoroughly than by the people of the South.'
They have not been won over to national feeling and approbation by preaching, but by
practice â not by theories, but by results. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ** y _^- ;
Therefore it is that praise has' taken the place of blame, approval that of criticism, confi
dence that of fear throughout the South, and the President represents to the people the measures
that have taken them out of their unprosperous and prejudiced past, and have planted their feet
beside ours in the common path that leads out' pf the past, by the pleasant places of the
present, and onward to a future that shines with the light of a still greater day.
His tour, undertaken no doubt with great fatigue, is wholly patriotic. He has reached the
summit of possibilities in this republic. There is no height; left to scale. He cannot make, votes,
nor gather influence for his personal aggrandisements No .selfish motive can be imputed to him
by the hypercritical. He is abroad to benefit his country by proving -: the substantial unity, and^
nationalism of his countrymen, and it is. a'dull spirit that does'not. thrill with the sentiment of his
STOCKMEN'S LINE OF BATTLE.
WE- have already noted the preparation for war on the public range. The line of battle
is extending. A dispatch from Cheyenne says that the cattle men of Sweetwater County,
Wyoming, have also established a dead line and warned sheep men riot to cross it. Up to
date none -have attempted it, though several large bands are. being driven toward it, and' their
drivers say they intend to cross and enter the forbidden pasture. One of these sheep men has
been warned in writing to turn back.
The Carbon County sheep men have offered ajyreward of $250 for each' man convicted of
In Idaho there is a stubborn. fight in the courts to hang a man who took part in the range
war of two years ago,. and all'along the frontier. means lawful and unlawful are in use in the battle
for the free range that belongs to one as much as to another. The property of the whole people
in these range lands on the public domain is the only property in the Union that is not under pro
tection of. the law. It enriches those who use it, and those who' own it get no pay for its use. If
it were. leased, as the Indian reservations are, its use would be paid for, its forage would be ore
served and its proceeds, devoted to irrigation, would, aid materially in the development of the
West without further burdening the taxpayers by irrigation appropriations in the river and
harbor bill.
It is to be hoped that the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture, as they pass
through the region where this war exists,- will observe the conditions and see the necessity for doing
something to extend law and order in place of lawlessness and disorder.

Not es a wonder child, but as a stu
dent, the little girl came before her audi
enoc on Tuesday evening and astonished
It by her musical prowess. She played
the brilliant- ."Scene* de Ballet" of De
Berlot and the "Wleniawski ."Legende,"
and her renderings made it quite evident
that there Is lacking nothing in the men
tal and emotional equipment of the little
player that- goes to Â«make the musician.
Her ear is perfect, she has both a strong
and delicate tone, phrasing and shading
are alike excellent, and her bowing and
fingering leave absolutely nothing to be

Curious to learn who has. so effectively
directed the child's studies, I inquired and
found that to Henry Holmes the credit of
the last year's Â¦work is due, and that her
former teacher. Mr. Conrad, still takes a
sufficient interest in the small violinist's
career to attend all her lessons at Mr.
Holmes* .house and supervise her practice
during tha week. _It Is. not easy to im
eglne a triser regime than that under
â¢which Kathleen Parlow is growing up.
She studies the ordinary school curricu
lum â¢with her mother, practices from three
to four Jaocrs a. day and spends all the
rest of her timÂ» In the beautiful San Ra
fael sunshine. Mens sana in . corpore Is
the one rigid Ideal adhered to, and how
â¢well it feas succeeded the audience" of the
ether evening will bear willing witness.
I understand, too, that the numbers given
the other night by little Kathleen were
in very deed and truth "child's play" to
her, and that among other big things her
repertoire Includes tho Max Bruch G
minor concerto, the ninth .concerto of
Cpohr and the Bach E minor sonata.
As for the rest of the ballad concert. It
Â¦was competently directed by "Wallace A.

In Tna-iring tip his mind as to the wisdom
of a painting trip to the "Â©semite Valley
this summer. Mr. Peters made haste to

"A painting trip to the To-s^mite? T\"hy,
of course, C D., it would pay up to the

In on it; you're a friend of mine. It is
simple enough, but remarkably effective
Â¦with the picturesquely inclined Easterner.
""When. Jorgeasen went up there he
built himself a handsome log cabin

"Why, of course Jorgensen locks the

of the powers to intervene with the ob
ject of preventing foreign Jews from set

the embassies replied that they could not

Chamber of Deputies.
PARIS, May 4.â The London Chronicle's
report of a Franco-Russian revival of the
Egyptian question was warmly discussed
by the Deputies at gatherings in the lob
bies of the Chamber during the recess to
day. The general opinion was that the re
port was unfounded. Premier Waldeck-
Rousseau declared . that the Government
did not desire to stir up the question, and
M. Denys Cochin, a close follower of
Egyptian developments, said it â¢would be
a flagrant contradiction of the present
French policy, and at this moment, when
France was pointing her efforts in the di
rection of Morocco and a tacit agreement
appeared to have established the African
continent into two vast domains â the
French to the west and the English to the
Eastâ a demonstration against Egypt is
most improbable.

A proposition is under discussion at
Woodland for the formation of a company

the purpose of drilling for oil. on some
spot to be selected as near Woodland. as
possible. "Joe" Craig and Charles Nelson
have taken the lead in the matter.

a sufficient sum of money to begin drill,

of the San -Benito County OH Company,

countered a body of salt water at a depth
of 1080 feet, which came up \yith such
force that it was considered impossible to
drill deeper. It was impossible to case the
water off, as the company was using the
smallest casine made.
. Shasta County has another new corn
pan v, called the Determination Oil Com

County. The officers are: President, E>r.

tary, W. L.Wentworth of Anderson. ...
The directors of the Minor Ranch Oil
Company, which owns lands in Colusa
County, near Gibson Spring, have decided
to purchase a standard rig to replace the
small one that has been used for boring
prospect holes in the country. ,
A correspondent at Bakersfleld writes
that the discovery of oil on section 23, 32,
23, in the Midway district, extends thÂ©
territory and indicates that the belt is
more than half a mile wide. The strike
of a company drilling between the Dab
ney lease and the town of McKlttrick Is
also considered important as showing' the
country to be productive down two and a
half miles from the McKlttrick Com
pany's scene of operations. - â¢
According to the Sacramento Record
Union, the order for fifty oil cars of 6500
gallons capacity has been nearly filled.

' All producing oil companies ln'the State
have received the circular letter scut out
by a committee concerning the proposed
Combined ; Petroleum Producers' Associa
tion. From advices received from such
companies as have taken the matter un
der consideration it '. appears certain the
"sentiment of the producers Is favorable
to th3 general plan. Included in the pow
ers of tho association, as provided, are
building of pipe lines, f ailroa'cla, tank
steamships and also to charter steam
ships. With the sale of lands by a com
pany to a third party the shares sub
scribed for in the association revert to the
association unles-s the successor in owner- j
ship, of the lands shall subscribe to the
Contracts and agreements entered into by
the selling stockholder upon the prior con
sent'of the association. It is expected the
declsion'of -each company in this import
ant. matter will soon be received. San
Francisco is designated as the principal
place of business. *.
The Los Angeles Herald gives currency
to the report that there Is a probability
that most of the oil wells in Los Angeles
will be closed for a month or so. Forty
producers met,' and while they . did not
reach any decision, at their first confer
ence the drift of opinion was in favor of
suspending operations" for a brief period.
There - are 882 wells in the Los Angeles
field which have marketed their product,
and the present total output of Los An
geles ' is estimated at 105,000 barrels per
month. There are stored about 169,000 bar
rels of petroleum in Los Angeles, of which
135,000 barrels are subject to sale. To dis
pose of this oil by November 1 with the
current product Involves a monthly con
sumption of "127,500 barrels. A committee
has been appointed to devise a plan of ac
tion concerning the Los Angeles producers
and to report at a future meeting. This
committee wM make a study of the prob
able consumption of oil during the coming
six months, and will report upon that In
teresting point.
T*> Raise the Price.
AccordlngXto the figures submitted it
was claimed the demand and supply in
Los Angeles willibe nearly equalized, pro
vided the sale of oil now on hand is con
trolled. The committee consists of Dr. W.
A. Lamb, L. G. Parker, W. H. Allen, E.
A. Doran, C. H. Daggett, Thomas O Don
nell and W. A. Morgan. The Los Angeles
Times says the purpose actuating the
movers in the matter is to obtain control
of the local petroleum market. Closing
down is proposed as a means of raising
the price of oil. . - , "
Already there has been a reduction in
derations in Los Angeles. There were
twenty-nine wells less drilling in the Los
Angeles field in April . than there were in
March. This Is conceded to be a sign
that the producers have decided to cur
tail operations until>the market recovers
from the effect of the developments in
other fields during the past year.V
According to the Bieber Gazette, there
is much excitement in Modoc County be
cause of the reported finding of oil on the
ranch of J. H. Hornbeck, between Cedar
ville and Eagleville, in Surprise Valley.
A flow of gas that burns is one of the
symptoms taken to indicate that there Is
oil in the vicinity- Oil locations have been
made and the people are undergoing the
experience that dwellers in other counties
have been having during the past few
months. ' .

Of course it is of no avail to consider
money made by men like the Rockefellers
and Morgan and their immediate friends.
They are regarded as the greatest winners
in Wall street, and their winnings amount
up into the millions.- A few days ago
Otto Loeb, the well-kr.own Wall-street
trader, bought 5000 shares of Union Paci
fic. It kept going up and up by seconds,
and in fifteen minutes it had reached a
point where he concluded to let go. He
sold in just one-quartor of an hour and
made a clean pro lit of S35,0Q0-
Fortune in a Few Minutes.
Men who were little known outside of
their own communities before the elec
tion of McKInley have an international
reputation as millionaires, consolidators
and combiners. For instance, few persons
outside the confines of Chicago ever
heard of John W. Gates or Mpore Broth
ers half a dozen or so years ago. Gates
to-day is known on both sides of the
Atlantic as a gambler in anything in
which he believes he can get a fair run
for his money. '<Â¦ Â¦ Oi Â¦
Gates bought United States Steel shares,
common and preferred, and, it is said, out
of those alone he made nearly double
what he lost on his first steel and wire
speculation. He and his friends have
been in Union Pacific trading and are sam
to' have unloaded most of their holdings
on Thursdary and Friday morning at long
prices. Gates Is put down as a winner at
the close of the market to-day to the
amount of $2,000,000. A large part of thi3
sum has been made in the past two weeks.
Other members of the "Chicago crowd"
have been able to divide about $6,000,000 or
57,000,000.
Ue-w Millionaires Are Hade.
NEW YORK, May 4.â When bankers
and brokers were ready to go home to
day for a day and a half's holiday the
general feeling seemed to be It was a
mighty good thing for everybody that a
check had come to speculation. One of
the bank presidents is quoted as saying
the level of prices the past week has been
altogether too high and not such as to
warrant conservative loans 6n securities
traded in. This man said there would
probably be no combination on the part
of banks to restrict loans, but there
would continue to be very decided dis
crimination on the part of bankers be
tween intrinsic and inflated values. .The
irclinatlon on the part of the public
seems to be to regard this fortune-mak
ing as having been compassed in about
sis days. As a matter of fact the period
of making has covered, generally speak
ing, about five years, more | particularly
speaking, about six -months. The riches
that have been accumulated by specula
tion and the wealth that has been built
up in trade must trace their actual point
of beginning to the first election of Mc-
Kinley. .

Brown, Director of Customs of Korea, has
become an international Incident of con

of the Russian Minister. It has been
Stated that Brown was removed because
of his failure to pay interest on the Jap
anese loan, but it is evident that the Jap
anese Government is not concerned over
Its failure to receive Interest, as It Is sup
porting Brown.
Both Great Britain and Japan will, it
is expected, make vigorous representa
tions to the Korean Emperor contemplat
ing Brown's -restoration. Mr. Allen, un
der Instructions sent him. when Brown
was dismissed several weeks ago, will re
new his representations in behalf of his
reappointment.
In his first dispatch to the Government
Allen asserted that Brown's removal men
aced American Interests and his mall re
ports elaborate on this point. Just how
American interests would be injured is not
made plain, as it is not probable that an
other person could be selected acceptable
to aU foreign governments who could per
form the duties of the office of Director
of Customs. Brown naturally has a grasp
on Korean customs affairs and is friendly
to Americans, so that this Government
prefers that he should remain.
The Brown Incident is not likely to pro
voke an international conflict, but the au
thorities fear that it will be another addi
tional cause for irritation in the relations
between Russia and Japan, and they de
sire that friction between these two coun
tries should be minimized.

CELEBRATED "WI2TD GAVE"
OPEN" TO THE PUBLIC
Hunt was convicted of holding up a
Japanese cook, who had just made a win
ning in a gambling house, and taking $300
from him. During his trial Hunt asserted
that Wilson was not his name, but if con
victed he wished to serve his sentence
under that name and thus save his par
ents from disgrace. In his application for
a marriage license to-day, however, he
made affidavit that his name was Hunt
and admitted that his family was well
known in Decatur. Hunt will be sentenced
to the penitentiary Monday.
Last Thursday Hunt, who has been
known in Salt Lake as- Harry Wilson,
was found guilty of highway robbery and
pending sentence was committed to Jail.
MJss Rogers, who is said to have been a
schoolmate of Hunt in Decatur, was in
constant attendance on the trial and this
morning called on him at the jail. After
a . brief conversation Hunt called an of
ficer, went with him to th'e County
Clerk's office and procured a marriage
license. Justice Lochrie was telephoned
for and, standing in the steel-barred cor
ridor of the jail, -Hunt and Miss Rogers
were married.
BALT LAKE. Utah, May 4.â Winfleld J.

The chairman of the Board of County
Commissioners, Porcher L'Engle, said to
day:
Will Replace County Buildings.
Cvery effort that could be made to put the
fire out -was made, but the strong wind 'and
the dryness of everything was too much for
the men at the factory, and when the depart
ment reached the scene the pine buildings and
the flying shingles made it impossible to con
trol the flre.
But the flre by this time had' gained con
siderable "headway. The hose was , quickly
brought into play, but the fire grot away from
the men and the alarm had to be sent ? in.
There is no flre in the Â¦ building 1 ,'" the factory
being, worked with electricity, and It ' Is two
months since the boilers were in use. - . â¢ Â¦ .
Outside the factory there Is a drying plat
form 200 feet square, upon which the moss is
piled after it has been ginned. Twenty feet
away there are two negro cottages , and the
chimney of one of these cottages was on flre.
This, however, is a frequent occurrence and
once or twice before the fiber on the drying
platform had been set afire from the falling
soot from the chimneys of the cottages. The
men knocked off at 12 o'clock for dinner and
were lying around in the shade, when one of
them discovered that from the middle of the
pile of moss smoke was issuing. This having
happened before no importance was attached to
It and two men seized buckets of water and
went to extinguish â¢ the flre. . .
K. E. Cleveland, proprietor of the Cleve
land Fiber Company, made the following
statement to-day regarding the origin of
the flre:
As to Origin of the Fire.
Drays loaded with furniture and trunks
filled the streets all day. Homeless peo
ple slept on improvised beds near their
furniture in quarters away from the
burned district. In the early hours of the
fire many people moved their property
distances of half a mile or a mile, only
to find it necessary to move it again, as
the flames encroached.
On every vacant lot in the territory sur
rounding the burned district families are
camped. Some had piled furniture about
them, spreading over them a blanket,
making a tent In many cases this cov
ering was only enough for the baby.
Some had brought a frying pan, some a
coffee pot, some had money to get bread ;
all were shared in turn. Over the gath
ering occasionally shrilled the mourning
of a negress whose child was missing, â¢ to
be followed by sobs in every key that
told of the habit of repression in the Cau
casian and the savage frankness of the
African.
During the progress of the fire* hun
dreds of people moved their goods into the
streets, but it was impossible to get drays
to carry the goods away, and furniture,
books and bric-a-brac were burned.
â¢Dr. StoutÂ«saved his library by digging
a hole in his yard, in which he burled his
becks, wrapped' up in a blanket. This
plan was followed by several persons.
Some buried their trunks in the same
manner.
Families Camp on Vacant Lots.
Major Birdshaw, under Colonel Lovell,
Is in immediate command of the troops.
The city is patroled and the entrances
to the burned districts guarded by senti
nels. â¢ Military headquarters have been' es
tablished on the vacant lots behind' the
Federal postofflce building. Passes are
necessary to enter the lines in any part
of the city. The suburbs of Jacksonville
stood out to-day like an oasis in the desert
of desolation. From Bridge street to Lau
rel a thin fringe three blocks deep stands
uninjured along the river front, but to
the eastward, northward and westward
of Hemming- Park an unbroken bed of
ashes meets the eye, in which gaunt chim
neys rear themselves like monuments in
a forgotten cemetery.
At 7 o'clock this morning Governor Jen
nings declared the city under martial law.
Colonel Lovell of the First Regiment is
coming with troops.
The following troops in addition to local
companies arrived during the day and are

City Under Martial Law.
TALLAHASSEE. Fla., Hay 4.â MacWMiams,
Adjutant General: Your call for Galnsville,
Orlando and Starke companies approved. Have
appointed L'Engle, R. R. Ward and Rogers
special relief committee, placing $20,000 at. their
disposal. W. S. JENNINGS, Governor.
The relief fund raised by citizens of
Jacksonville at a meeting this evening
amounts to $15,000. This was augmented
to-night by a telegram from the Armour
Company of Chicago instructing- Mayor
Bowden to draw for $1000. Other subscrip
tions are being received from many
places. Jacksonville will not yet make an
official appeal for aid. There seems to be
some objection to this, but it is mainly
based on the position by many leading
citizens that Jacksonville and Florida can
meet the emergency and care for their
own.
The following telegram was received
from the Governor to-day:
A committee Â¦was appointed at a meet
ing of citizens this afternoon to telegraph
the Governors of various States to send
all the tents they can spare to Jackson
ville. It will be weeks before anything
like permanent shelter can be provided
for the homeless thousands, and Jackson
ville for some time to come will be a city
of tents.
Ten thousand people are homeless and
many of them left on afternoon and
night trains for St. Augustine and other
coast cities and nearby towns, while nu
merous river craft took many to little
places on the St. Johns River.". SupDly
stations have been established in different
parts of the city and all day they have
been thronged by the hungry. The prompt
action of Secretary of War Root in ten
dering the use of the barracks near St.
Augustine was received with gratitude on
every side. The East Coast trains leav
ing here at 5 o'clock this afternoon car
ried to St. Augustine over 2000 people who
hope to' receive temporary shelter from
the Government.
Ten Thousand Are Homeless.
The city is under martial law and all of
the available State militia is on duty in
the streets of Jacksonville. Some order
is being brought out of the confusion.* 1
Jacksonville is facing the emergency
calmly and has organized for relief work.
The burned district is thirteen blocks
wide and two miles long, and extends
from the St. Johns River, where it 'burned,
ten wharves to the water's edge, to Catn
erine street, on the east; Orange on the
north and Davis on the west. This im
mense area was swept as clean as a floor.
There are many rumors Â¦ affoat of loss
of life, but as every undertaker i In, the
city was burned out it is imDossible to
obtain an official report. One storv which
is persistently reiterated is to the effect
that a party of men and women, driven
to the docks by the fire, were compelled
to jump into the water and that several
of them were drowned. Mrs. Hogan, a
negro woman, was burned in her hGUse
and her charred remains were buried by
friends this afternoon. ; .%.Â¦:.-:'Â¦Â¦-Â¦;Â¦ Â»-'''- jIV
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., May
sonville's great flre yesterday has burned
itself out. One hundred and forty-eight
blocks of a beautiful city have been laid
waste. .The loss will, not be known even
approximately for a week, but it is be
lieved it will amount to $10,000,000.,
improving to-night, and It is thought he
will entirely recover. The children of Dr.
P. H. Dean, reported as burned or miss
ing this morning, have been found alive.
Dr. Dean's injuries are slight. '. .
President Barnett of the National . Bank
of Jacksonville is not seriously hurt.
There were many prostrations from heat
during the day. * . ? Â¦
Picturesque and Pitiful.
Jacksonville is in total darkness to
night, save for the red reflection tha
burns in the sky in the western portior
of the city, marking the vast fields oi
glowing embers that now and then arÂ«
fanned into flame.
At 6 o'clock the first trolley car was
operated since noon yesterday.â In the
evening schedules were maintained on
East Bay street and on the river line.
At 7 o clock additional troops reached the
city to relieve the soldiers, who had been
on duty for than twenty-four hours.
Crowds are* leaving the city. on outgoing
trains, yet the multitude of /homeless peo
ple on the streets does not appear de
creased. The night scenes are pictur
esque and pitiful. About the city are
cordons of soldiers and at each corner a
policeman or a soldier stands. Amid the
great excitement the day has passed and
the city to-night is very quiet. Little dis
order has been reported.
_ At a meeting of the citizens' committee
this evening a resolution was adopted
prohibiting the running of excursion
trains into the city. Â¦,.. Requests had' been
made by several places for special trains
to Jacksonville, but the committee in
formed the roads that if the trains were
run the excursionists would not be al
lowed to leave the trains. The negroes,
though hungry and terror-stricken, have
so tar shown no uisposltion to give
trouble. :
The Times-Union and Citizen announces
to-nig-ht the receipt of nearly $2000 con
tributed-to the relief fund from cities
throughout the United States. Surgeon
General Wyman is sending to-day a car
load of tents for the fire sufferers. *Â¦
Barracks and Tents Furnished.
"WASHINGTON, May 4.â Secretary Root
to-day received a telegram from the
Mayor ' of Jacksonville, asking that tfie
St. Francis barracks in that city be put
at the disposal of the Mayor to house 1000
homeless people. Secretary Root imme
diately sent a dispatch to General Brooke,
in command of the department of the
East, to direct the officer in charge of
the barracks to grant the people of
Jacksonville every facility possible.
The Secretary received a dispatch dur
ing the day asking for a large supply of
tents, the Mayor indicating that the peo
ple of the city were without shelter. He
gave orders to have 1000 hospital tents
sent at once. These tents are at St.
Asaphs, Va., just across the river from
this city, and at Philadelphia. They will
go forward on the first available trains.
DROWNED IN THE RIVER.
From the Flames.
Many Persons Perish WMle Fleeing
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., May 4.â A sail
boat at the boat yard at Third and Main
streets was made use of during 1 the fire
by Alfred Ball of Springfield, a suburb.
Ball says:
There were certainly many lives lost at that
point. The shrieks and cries for help that
came to my ears during the first moments of
the four hours that I was in the river were
heartrending and awful. I was utterly help
less to aid. I am positive at least five per
sons were drowned at that place.
I got In a sailboat at Gardner's yard at Â¦ 6
o'clock. There were about fifteen persons
aboard, two negroes among the number. When
we got into the boat every avenue of escape
was cut off. We got a line to the steamer
Edith and she pulled up at the dock.
A moment later the Una parted. Two bateaux
were drifting alongside and eight persons tried
to eet into them., In the panic - both boats
capsized. I saw several, go down and drown.
Several of those who got out of the sailboat
were swe?t under the* wharf at the foot of
Market street, and I ... think all must have
perished. I got to the wharf and for four
hours held to the piling. When I was rescued
I was badly burned about the head. I felt a
body float against my legs and tried. to lift it
to the surface, but failed. Undoubtedly there
were many lives lost at the foot of Market
street.
Arthur Cummer of the Cummer Lumber
Company told the following:
We heard shrieks and calls for help as . we
steamed from the wharf at the last minute.
We heard a number of persons were in -peril
on the wharf . and . made for the pier again.
A sail boat was in the docks. Young Cox
setter of St. Augustine swam to the steamer
Edith and we gave him a line. The line
either parted or was burned. In the same in
stant both steamer and boat were enveloped in
dense smoke. We got a glimpse of the sail
boat drifting in shore and then it disappeared
In the flames. As the Edith steamed toward
midchannel to escape we heard agonizing cries
for help. There is no. doubt but that all in
the boat suffered a frightful fate.
The officers and crew of the Edith re
port that they saved sixty persons who
had jumped into the river to escape the
flames. .

There Is a cure for dyspepsia. Sufferers
who have tried noxious nostrums will
probably be skeptical, but skepticism van-
ishes when Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
tried. Whether the trouble is dyspepsia of
long standing, or merely a simple case of
indigestion, relief is prompt and pro-
nounced. The less the trouble the fewer
tablets need be taken.TWSCjS8StfS|W8BWK8i|
Heaviness after eating, sour stomach,
as indicated â¢ by belching, fatigue with
slight exertion, or with no exertion at all.
disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipation,
depression, "blues," these things can com-
monly be set down as symptoms of dys-
pepsia. And dyspepsia is merely indiges-
tion in an aggravated form. *
By promoting perfect digestion, Stuart'a
Dyspepsia Tablets produce) ' strong nerves,
restful, refreshing sleep, pure blood and
good sound healthy. flesh. ' They make the
skin - clear, the eyes bright, the mind

Stuart'B Dyspepsia Tablets arÂ« a medi-
cine and more than a medicine. They di-
gest the food and make it easy of assimi-
lation, and they, relieve the inflamed: dis-
eased condition of the ' membranous lin-
ings and the glands â¢ of , the stomach and
bowels. .: They help â¢ the Â¦ digestive organs
over the hard places, and put them into a
healthy, active condition. , They 'effect '," a
quick and permanent cure: :â¢ .You .don't
have to continue taking them forever, still
it is well to have a box handy and take
one at the first return of the trouble. .
Perfectly well people are made sick by
eating "too much, ' or ., unwholesome food,
but not if they take a tablet after eating.
Treatment with , Stuart's Â» Dyspepsia Tab-
lets does not necessitate dieting or any
change of habitu. They digest the proper
food and act upon the other kind: in such
a way as to make it pass off quickly and
harmlessly. '.You may eat and drink what
you like, when you like, and : as much f as

Lieutenant Commander, U. S. N., ln charge.
Attorney Sweeney, who represents tho
defendant, said . afterward that O'Connor
must havo been tnmepred with, as his
evidence In' court was entirely opposed to
what he had told Him. He promises some
BensHttonal developments to-morrow. .,*
Chappelle and Sylvester both testified
that there were houses of the. same de
scription as the one where the defendant
lived on their. beat. Chappelle had arrest
ed two women on Mason street since April
18. Sylvester had been on the beat about
three weeks, but had made no arrests.
Both denied ever having received money
from women. '
Lieutenant Price testified that Chap
pelle was once a member of his squad in
Chinatown. The question was asked,
"Did you know of his â¢ receiving 1 money
from women?" Tho question was object
ed to by Assistant District Attorney Han
ley and it was not pressed. The question
was then asked, "Do you know his repu
tation for truth, honesty and integrity?"
It was also objected to, and Captain Witt
man whispered to Hanley, who withdrew
his objection. Price replied that he did
not know.
Price said that Detective Ed Gibson and
Watchman George Downey had told him
that one of his squad was receiving money
from women. Two of the squad com
plained to him about the same thing, and
he went to the house mentioned and
threatened to razo it if the Inmates did
not tell the truth. A Chinese pointed out
Officers Chappelle and Morton, and Chap
pelle admitted that the Chinese had of
fered him $5 not to arrest him. but he de
clined the offer. That was all there was
to it.
W. .T. O'Connor, the srrocer at O*Parrell
n^irf Mason streets, testified that the de
fondant wns drlnklnjr beer In his- store
with an old man when Officer Chappelle
cnlled her out. directly contrndlctlngr tho
defendant and corroborating Chappello.
Ht'nri Pradnl. tho proprietor of the house
where tho defendant lives, did not appear,
und the case was continued till to-morrow.
Once when an objection was "made by
the prosecution to a question put to Lieu
tenant Price Captain Wittman suggested
that the objection should not be pressed,
and the Question was answered. There
was little or nothing of a sensatlnal char
acter brought out. Something of the kind
ia promised to-morrow.
The defendant testified to Chappelle
calling her out of O'Connor's grocery at
O'Farrell and Mason streets Saturday
night. April 27, and saying to her, ''I've
got you now and will make it hot for
you." Mike Nolan, after her arrest by
Chappelle on April 17, had told her in the
presence of Henri Pradel, proprietor of
the house were she boarded, that he could
"fix it" with the officers on the beat so
that she would not be molested, and men
tioned Sylvester's name. The amount
n8med by Nolan was $2 60 for each of tho
officers per month.
ln answer to a question by the Judge
she said she had never been approached
by an officer with such a proposition and
no other person' except Nolan had ever
rcade the suggestion to her. She j ftad
never been hounded or persecuted by any
officer except Chappelle. Nolan told her
that a woman companion of his was al
lowed to go about the streets and she
could do the same thing. After the report
of Nolan's conversation with her in an
evening paper Nolan came to her and
said he had 'made a statement to Chief
Sullivan and had denied everything she
said.

THE navy tug Vigilant went ashore
on Goat Island yesterday morning,
but g-ot off later with the assist
ance of the lighthouse tender Ma
drono at hlg-h water. The Vigilant
left the training ship Pensacola on her
usual morning trip with a party of "shore
leave men." bound for the city. A strong
flood tide was running and it set the tug
Inshore. A sharp turn has to be made
after getting away from the training ship
In order to cles.r the southerly point of
the Island.. There was not enough room
In Â¦which to make it on account of the
set of the tide and the Vigilant went bow
on the beijch.
The engines were going astern before
she struck, but they could not prevent the
Accident and neither could they back her
off. Then all the passengers were sent
ashore to lighten the vessel and a small
kedge anchor was got out astern, but
even then the Vigilant would not budge.
Word was sent over to the Madrono, and
that vessel went to the assistance of the
Etranded tug. It took some time to get
a hawser aboard, but even after it had
been made fast and with the Madrono
polng full speed ahead and the Vigilant
iroing- full speed astern the latter would
not move. For over two hours the Ma
drono pulled on the stranded tug. but It
was not until thevnaxlmum of high water
that she was cot off.
The axen who had shore leave were dls
grusted with the mishap, as they lost their
holiday. The tug was not damaged, as
fhe went on a sandy beach, but never
theless she look the sailors back to the
training snip and then went out of com
mission for t&e day.

D. P. Doak of St. Louis says there Is a
chance ' that the State line pass district
may have a smelter and that the decision
rests with the- railroad people, who have
been asked i for concessions on shipments
of coke/>bal, fuel, supplies and. all requi
sites for a large plant. The district is on
the edge of Inyo County. The ore Is of
low grade, but if concessions are secured
the-work may be carried on at .a profit.
The' cost of hauling to Manvel Is $15 per
ton.' :Â¦Â¦'â¢Â¦"'â¢Â¦ . ..;â¢ Â¦:Â¦:.- Â¦ .......

j Dredger mining has the middle of the
stage Just now. Mining men are paying
large sums for dredging machines and
thousands of dollars for tracts of land to
operate upon. A golden shower falls upon
the people who live near the scene of the
dredging operations. Machine shops have
been built along the river banks near the
dredgers. Houses "are constructed to ac
commodate tho people employed. So the
machinist and the carpenter reap. benefits.
The Interior papers, seeing the steady ad
vancement of *he dredging industry and
the developments that accompany, it, are
making prophecies concerning the future
extent of dredging for gold. The Biggs
Argus says:
The prospects are that within the next few
years the banks of the Feather River will be
lined with dredgers. A trip between Biggs and
Oroville shows some wonderful changes that
have taken place within the last two years and
the panorama- of a coming year, or two will
show astounding developments in the evolu
tion of dredge mining. Already nine immense
dredgers are ln active operation and probably
as many more. are ln course of construction.
That this system of -mining is bringing most
satlsfactury returns to . the , operators is In
dicated by the fact that : men . of experience.
solid business judgment and means have paid
seemingly unreasonable prices Â¦. for the land
along tho river and do not hesitate to pay
from $40,000 to $70,000 each for. the construction
and equipment of the monster machines.
Among recent mining*, deals reported in
California are the bonding of the Doyle
mine ln Amador County tp San Francisco
parties, the sale of the PfJCe mine ln the
same county by the Chicagb Mining Com
pany and the bounding of the Free Lance
mine in : Tuolumne County, to "William
Sharwood. The Doyle mine is a patented
claim, situated not far from Jackson, on
the Zeila lode. A , company will _ begin
operations about the 1st of June. The
Amador Dispatch figures that the opera
tion of the Doyle and the Amador Queen
Â¦No. 'Â¦ 2," which has resumed, will put new
lite'.; Into the. South -Jackson district. A
ney corporation has been formed to op
erate the Amador Queen No. 2. The Price
mine Is about three miles north of Ply
mouth: . The .Tuolumne Independent re
ports that C. D. Lane hns made an offer
for the purchase of the Hope mine, which
has been : closed down ; pending negotia
tions. According to the Angels Record
the . old Field mine, near Angels , Camp,
has been sold and work is about to begin.
The Brunner ,. mine has' been. bonded and
the Union copper mine is under bond. to
Eastern parties.
. The - Placerville Nugget says that the
Schneider mine has been bonded Â¦ by "WV
C. & Bryant to- Hayward & Lane. W. I.
Smart will have sharge-of the develop
ment ' work.
To-day the Jenny Llnd Gold Mining Com
pany closed a deal whereby the company comes
Into possession of eighty acres of the Isaac L.
Weed ranch on Alta Hill. The company has
had this piece of land- bonded for some months
and to-day the purchase money .was paid. Mr.
,Weed - conveys to the company all the water
ditches, quartz and. gravel rights, etc, - to the
land. 1 . -By the purchase of this tract the Jenny
Llnd Company now has a claim 6500 feet : on
the 'trend of the ledse.
The Chico Record reports that tests are
going on alone Butte Creek, on the
Groves and Hanscom ranches, to deter
mine whether dredges shall be construct
ed to mine for gold on the creek.- During
several weeks B. Cuslck has been quietly
securing bonds on various lands and has
succeeded ln taking in nearly all the avail
able land for a distance of from five to
six miles. He does not propose to dredge,
so says the Record, but expects to sell the
property to those who have had experi
ence in' dredging for gold. Butte Creek
has been rich ln gold. If the reports are
favorable the construction of dredges will
begin early. . .
The Los Angeles Herald says it is re
ported that . the gold fever has struck
Ollnda, Orange County, on account of the
discovery of two ledges that bear gold. ,

Senator I John F. Davis furnishes some
details of the plans to supply water to
the Sweepstakes Gravel Mining Company,
which owns the gravel mine near "Weaver
ville. Trinity County. The mine comprises
1900 acres. The ditch, which will carry 400
inches of water, will follow along , the
mountain side and will be twenty-nine
miles Ions. The cost of constructing Â¦ the
ditch will be about $350,000.
The great plant of the Mountain Copper
Company at Keswick, Shasta County, will
be operated by electricity. A contract ha9
been signed, so the Redding Searchlight
says, with the Keswick Electric Power
Company for the necessary power. This
company is installing a plant at Mill Seat
Creek in the Shingletown region, and will
have capacity to develop 1500 horsepower.
The stamps of the new mill of the Tel
low Aster mine at Randsburg have begun
to drop on ore. The Randsburg Miner
says that the mine . stand3 to-day ln the
names of its original owners and that no
stock in the company Is sold to outside
parties. There is enough ore blocked out
to keep both mills running for some years.

We naturally believe in Grape-Nuts.
-or It has saved the life of our baby."

"The doctor was doins all he could, but
finally we sent for an uncle, an old physi-
cian, to come and see her. The doctors
agreed perfectly, but uncle advised us to
use Grape-Nats Food.
"TVe immediately got some and placed
a spoonful ln some boiling water. This
"was allowed to Blmmer until the food be-
Â«aoe perfectly soft. A little rich milk was
s<i<le<l and just enougrh sugar to sweeten.
It mode a delicious food, and It was as-
tonlEhlng how perfectly it agreed with our
baby and how ehe did lick it down.
"Ehe would not drink milk unless It had
Grape-Kuts Food ln it thereafter.
"After a few days she began to show
marks of improvement, then she improved
very rapidly. When we began feeding her
Grape-Kuts she weighed about ten pounds,
now she weighs over thirty and Is almost
as broad as sh<j Is long.
Our frlend3 all think It a miracle that
Bhe recovered. While I am writing this
Jetver one of my older girls has just come
up begging for some Grape-Nuts and
cream.
"Ehe was starving to death, for every-
thing she ate was immediately thrown off
from her stomach. We tried every kind
of food we could think of, and only kept
her alive by rubbing olive and cod liver
oil Into the pores of ter skin.
A minister's wife, name given below,
writes: "I do not exaggerate ln the least
Â¦when I Bay that I havo never yet seen a
picture of the Btarvlng babies of India
that looked as bad as our baby did. The
tkin wu drawn as tigrhtly as possible over
her little frame and was almost black.
Her little form was so shrunken that It
tras pitiable to look at. Her bright eyes
only showed that ehe was alive.
When a baby's life can be Bared by
food It la -worth while knowing something
of that food.

Deane Waits for Advice.
Rumor that Shenit LÂ»ackmann . would
not seek the Republican nomination, but
would run as an independent candidate
for re-election, was spread persistently
during the day, but the Sheriff denies any
such intention. He says he will be a can
didate before the - Republican convention
unless conditions should change greatly
before delegates to Â¦, the convention be
chosen', and that at present he has no in
tention of running independently In any
event.
This surprising news bruited about the
City Hall caused more talk than has been
devoted to politics in a month past and
quite overshadowed I McKinley reception
plans. Meanwhile . Deane, who holds the
key to the situation- so far as these can
didates are concerned, keeps his own
counsel, waiting, as he- explains, for thu
arrival of-certain advisers who will help
him decide whether he. shall become a'
candidate for Sheriff, seek a third term
as County Clerk or retire from the politi
cal game for the present. :Â¦ â¢
Joseph Goddard, V. F. Northrop, A. B.
Mahony and possibly W. R. Jost, all dep
uties Â«in the County Clerk's office, are the
aspirants to Deane's present position. All
are Judicious In declaring that if Deane
becomes' a candidate their. loyalty to him
will prevent their becoming his opponents
before the convention.. But- they have
taken the precaution to let it be known
in advance of any declaration from. Deane
that if he Is not a candidate they, will be

Deane, it is rumored, wants to enter the
lists against Lackmann and other candi

he is at present undecided whether to

shall not show ingratitude and become an

Deputy Clerk Goddard also has served
under Deane for seven years in the capac

clerk to Deane himself.
"If Mr. Deane decides not to run,'.' God
dard said, VI am a candidate for the of

run and that he will be a candidate for

W. R. Jost denies that he will be a can

his name nevertheless will be presented
to the Republican convention.

TWO UrSPECTOBS ADDED
TO THE OLD FORCE
at S26 Hyde street last Thursday. The
Btory of the family troubles Is a roman
tic one. and the developments of the last
few chapters have been highly sensa
tional. . ..
Several years ago Coleman met and aft
erward married the only daughter of Mrs.
Mary Burdell of Burdells Station. The
young lady was heiress to 'half a million
dollars and very popular In the exclusive
society in which she moved. Shortly after
the birth of their child Kathlynne Mrs.
Coleman deserted her husband and said
she would never have anything more to
do with him. Mr. Coleman. who iff a
heavy investor in oil properties, allowed
her to do as she wished without moles
tation and continued in the pursuit of hie
business.
Last March he applied for divorce on
the ground of desertion, which was grant
ed by default, the court ruling that the
child should remain with the mother, un
less the latter married again. In which
case the little girl should be surrendered
to her father. Six days after the divorce
was granted Mrs. Coleman was married
at Reno. Nev., to Ed Smith. The child
had meanwhile, by the consent or both
parents, been placed In the care of mutual
friends at San Jose.
A short time ago Mrs. Smith assumed
the care of the child again without the
knowledge of Coleman. When he discov
ered the course affairs had 'taken he has
tened at once to the Smith residence on
Hyde street and demanded the child. A
wild scene ensued, culminating in Cole
man's arrest and trial on a charg-e of dis
turbing the peace and carrying concealed
weapons.
In accordance with the terms of divorce

tried to take forcibly from her mother

ney, Maurice Samuels, yesterday applied

THE splendid ten-story and base
ment hotel structure to be erected
at the northwest corner of Powell
and Geary streets, eft the site of
the old Calvary Church, is pictured
herewith. The drawing is by the archi
tects. Bliss & Faville, who will superin
tend the work of construction. The build
ing will be in the French renaissance
style. The lower story* will be built of
some light-colored stone, which has not
yet been determined opon. The upper
stories will be of brick and terra cotta.
The cost, including the furniture, will ap
proximate $1,500,000. To carry the hotel
project on' two corporations have been
formed. -'. r â . .
The first of these corporations is the
Crocker Hotel Company, which' is to be
organized to purchase the real estate and
to erect the hotel building in the locality
Indicated and "to carry on the hotel busi
ness In all its branches." This corpora
tion has capital stock to the amount of
51,500,000, divided into 15,000 shares of the
par value of $100 each. The corporation is
to exist for fifty years. The directors who
are to serve the first year are' Henry T.
Ecott. Charles E. Green, William H.
Crocker, Charles H. Shaw and Alexander
F. Morrison. Each" director and John J.
Mahor.ey has subscribed for one share of
the Btcck, the actual subscription total
being $600.
The second corporation is the one that
Â¦will actually conduct the hotel, and will
be known as the San Francisco Hotel
Company. The directors in this company
are F. W. Dolirmann, W. Forsyth, E. A.
proceedings, Mr. Coleman now applies for
the legal restoration of his child. He is
willing that the child should live with
outside parties, but declines to allow her
remain under the same roof with Smith.
Attorney Shurtliff. Mrs. Smith's legal
adviser, says a minor child is always the
ward of the court, and that the previous
decision can easily be set aside. Mrs.
Smith means to keep the child at all haz
ards. The case will be brought up in
Judge Troutt's court Monday.
Kathlynne, by the -will of her grand
mother, Mrs. Burdell, is heiress to nearly
$100,000. but both parties state that this
is no factor In the contention. The Smiths
at nresent are living in a state of siege
at 926 Hyde street, according to the state
ments of neighbors. Every door of ap
proach is barred and the house bell Is
answered by a domestic from a third
story window.
' There are several details that have not
been decided 'jpon in the matter of con
struction, but the larger plans are com
pleted. The hotel building will not con
tain any stores or offices, being strictly
and exclusively for hotel purposes. In a
general way the arrangement of rooms is
based .upon the Touraine in Boston and
the Manhattan in New York. There will
be about SCO rooms. Every bedroom will
have an outside exposure and bath. Every
suite will, have a telephone connecting
with the office system. The lighting will
be by electricity. There will be three pas
senger-elevators and a fast freight and
a fast service elevator. A mezzanine floor
will have banqueting-rooms and recep
tion-rooms for banqueting guests. .. On the
top floor will be rooms for bachelors.
The feature of the hotel which will at
tract the greatest attention will be the.
arrangement and the furnishings of the
first, or ground floor. The picture shows
the style of the entrance and of the col
onnade, which will be very elegant. On
the southeast corner, fronting on Powell
and Geary streets; will be a palm garden
47x88 feet in dimensions. Tnis will be
open to ladies and gentlemen. Man will
be at his ease there, being permitted to
The Main Plans Completed.
Bruguiere. S. L. Goldstein, Mark L. Gerstle,
M. H. Hecht and William Thomas. This
company is organized with $300,000 capital
stock and with a life duration ol fifty
years. Each of the directors subscribes
for one share of stock, the par value of
which is $100. In the articles of incorpora
tion power is conferred to purchase, sell,
lease, mortgage and construct and con
duct hotels and lodging-houses and all
business incident thereto. This corpora
tion will furnish and conduct the hotel,
which the other company will construct.
It is said the Crocker estate has se
c*ured the services of Allan Pollok, at
present holding the responsible position
of buyer at the Palace, td manage the
hotel on its completion. Pollok is an old
hotel man and has a host of friends who
predict that the Crocker estate cannot se
cure a better man for the place.
In interior decoration the hotel will af
fect quietness and nothing gaudy will ap
pear. The furniture will cost about a
quarter of a million dollars. Money- will
not be spared in making the hotel the
most perfect structure for its uses that
can be devised and provided. It will be
fireproof, modern in every respect and
will anticipate the future as far as pos
sible in comforts and conveniences. The
work of excavating the lot for the foun
dations may begin within the next two
months. The expectation is that the ho-j
tel will not be ready for occupancy in
much less than two years. . .
The colonnade will separate the palm
garden from a library and a reception
room, the latter being on the northeast
corner with an entrance from the streets.
The library and reception-room both face
on Powell street. The library is 25:6x34:6
feet in size. The office will be directly
back of the library. Between the office
and the palm garden is a large loung
ing room for laoies and gentlemen, which
will be furnished with tables, magazines
and -all other conveniences. This room
is arranged to be 42x69:6 feet. On the
ground floor there is a ladies' parlor. At
the . back ! will be the main dining-room,
39x126 feet in size. The office will be able
to command a view of all parts of the
floor and the entrance to the barroom,
etc., the latter being in the basement.

Nearly two- weeHs ago Thomas G.
Jacques, a' capitalist,. and his' wife", Caro
line E. Jacques, were arrested on com
plaint of Mrs.^ Margaret L.' Gowdey of
Brooklyn,' N..Y., jwho is'at present in' the
city, on the charge of kidnaping her uncle,
Joseph O'Hare, an old man who had'lived
with the -Jacques family, -arid when . the
case was called; in Judge Cabariiss' court
it was continued till Tuesday, next. It was
then alleged 'by, Attorney: Cannon, who
represents > Mrs. \ Gowdey, that the Â¦ object
of kidnaping ;the old man was to get pos
session of his property, valued at between
$20,000 and $40.000. Â¦ â¢". >'. â¢' .
Yesterday Mrs. Gowdey swore to a com
plaint in Judge Â¦ Cabaniss' court Â¦ charging
Mr. -and. Mrs. Jacques and their son,-
Thomas . G." J. Â¦ Jacques, Â¦ with Â¦ grand lar
ceny, the "amount, involved Â¦Â¦ being $19,000.-
Attorney Cannon stated â¢ that : the ; old , man
O'Hare, - who was * absolutely ; incompetent
to transact business, had been induced by.
the Jacques family to transfer his account
in : the German Savings ; Bank " to â¢ Thomas
G. Jacques, and Jacques had withdrawn
the money, amounting to $8000. on deposit
there. The Jacques family had also taken
the old man. to. the Hlbernla Bank, it was
alleged, and had withdrawn $11,000 on de
posit there. To give a semblance of sin
cerity to the affair the Jacques family had
sold to the old man' some prcaerty on
Lombard street -for "love and affection,'
the .consideration being $10., and. a legal
transfer of the property had been made
to-Mrs. Mary Jane Rodgers, wife of the
Controller. In . Minneapolis, another niece
of the old man,. and. her daughter Tillie.
The bonds .were â¢ fixed - In $1000, or $1500
cash for each of the defendants. ';,>-'
Â¦The defendants were arrested at the St.
Nicholas Hdtel by â¢ Policeman . Laws and
booked at the City Prison. George A.
Knight, was soon rat .the. Hall of- Justice,
and- at. his : request the defendants were
brought into court, as he desired. to show
cause , why . the , . bail Â¦ should be reduced.
Knight alleged that the. whole business
was caused by | spite because the old man
O'Hare had favored Mrs. Rodders instead
of Mrs. Gowdey. Mrs.iJacques-had writ
ten to both' Mrs. Gowdey and Mrs. Rodg
ers to come here, as the old man was, sickj
and * they both came, but .-Mrs. Rodgers
came 1 first *and" took him-home to Minne
apolis with - her, Â¦:Â¦_ where he now is. Â¦ Mrs.
Rodgers Â¦ and' her husband - would ' be ' here
in a day, or two, " and - Mrs.' Gowdey's Â¦ at
torney was ] aware â¢ of 1 the ; fact- The Jac-
ques family had some. money belonging, to
the old man. which would be turned over
to the proper person.
* "The woman lied," declared Knight ve
hemently, "when she swore Â¦ to the com
piain t. and her attorney had made him
self liable to> subornation of perjury.'!. 1
Attorney Cannon was sent for, and he
declared positively that the old man was
absolutely Incompetent, but Knight de
clared as positively that he was perfectly
sane.
The Judge decided, on Knight's positive
assurance that the defendant would be In
court Tuesday afternoon, to reduce the
ball to $200 each, which was promptly
forthcoming and 'the defendants were re
leased. - Both the kidnaping and. grand
larceny cases will-be heard, Tuesday af

An uneventful day of the strike of the
Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance was closed j
last night by the strikers,' both male and
female, giving- a public demonstration of
their numerical strength by a night pa
rade. The start was made trom the head
quarters in B'nai B'ritn Hall. .Headed by
a drum major wearing a cook's white cap
and apron, the route was taken from the
hall along Taylor street to Golden Gate
evenue and then to LarKin street. Uy tne
time the ; head of the procession had
reached the junction - pf\ Market, Hayes
and Parkin streets ,lne rear end was just
lcnwnu Taylor street.
Each man wore the red badge of the al
liance, wniie'tne waitresses rode in car
riages furnished by the Hackmen's Union.
Many tore Hags and a numDer of trans
parencies Â¦were carried. Some of tnese
itaa, â¢'convicts aie allowed a uay of rest;
wny not tne waiters;" "At tne utginning
ol the twentiem century we want six
days insceaa 01 seven"; "Don't patronize
umair nouses; an lair nouses have union I
cards." TneSe weie plentifully sprinmeu
iuoniT' the line.
u;.c iransparency was draped in black.
It iead,~ "ban ..Francisco has too mucn
Johnson," and was greeted witn cheeia.
Johnson is tne president or the restaurant ;
proprietors' orjKanisiation.
As each ."umuirl+.nouse along the line of
march was passed hisses and noots greet
ed the ' proprietors, who generally re-:
mained indoors. - At Johnson's place on
RiarKet. street, a â¢ great crowd gathered.
.Two stalwart officers stood in tne door
way, tne place being closed before the
procession reached. there. To the tune of
a dead march were added the groans and
cries' of. tne paraders. "
In anticipation of trouble a large force
of police, under the "command of Sergeant
Campbell, was held irr reserve in Steven
son street, but the services of the patrol
men were not needed. The -crowd, though
vociferous, was not disorderly, and quiet
ly dispersed.
So lar no action has been taken by the
executive committee of the San Fran
cisco' Labor Council in -relation to the
matter of boycott. Secretary Rosenberg
says it is a delicate question and until
the matter is thoroughly investigated
matters will stand as they are. As the
case stands now the power lies in the
hands of the executive committee to act
and a general sympathetic strike or boy
cott could be called at any moment.
At the headquarters of the alliance it
is claimed that thirty-six proprietors of
restaurants gave in yesterday, making a
total of 1SS at present who have agreed
to abide by the regulations of the union.
â¢The restaurant men claim that with the
exception of a few 'small restaurants,
their ranks are still unbroken.
Three of the unions- affiliated ' with the
carriage-making*, business will v meet ; this
morning-: at the -Temple to ''consider'; the"
matter of' strike and' boycott;'.^ â¢ .' ! ' : -"â¢â¢Â¦*"
Men connected with the \transfer busi
ness will be penalized $5 if , found eating
in an "unfair" restaurant.

From the form players' \ point of view
the stake was not a success financially,
for on seventeen^ occasions the hounds
which were held at top prices failed to
make good. Jn the two sapling events,
however, the pikers were the hard luck
story-tellers, short-end candidates being
denied even a single â¢ victory. Â¦
The hares were in good .condition, which
means that getting the flag liu,to-day's
finals will be preceded by some good run
â¢ Paio Alto is a likely candidate for stake
honors. His work in the run-down showed
that he is in fine trim. The champion's
great fault, and ofttimes an expensive
one for his backers, is hesitation. He dis
played none of this in his, course vester
day, but. on the contrary, exhibited great
dash and viciousness In his kill. â¢
Sisquoc will meet Luxor in the second
round and the chances are in his favor.
Considering his performances he looks to
have a hold on second place and ready for
an argument with Geary's dog for top
honors. Wedgewood, Harlean Gladys
and Sir Pasha are next in favor.

SAN DIEGO, May 4.â Instead of
having a single queen of the water
carnival, which is to be given In
honor of the visit of the British
battjeship Warspite to these wat?
ers on next Monday night, if no plans
miscarry. San Dego will have al
most a baker's dozen. The Warspite Is
expected % to readh port to-night or to
morrow morning, and as it is the first
visit to an American port that Admiral
Bickford will have made since he was
elevated to the command of the Pacific
squadron of the British navy, the people

This seemed easy of consummation,
but the girls themselves objected. They
said that the people could foster as much
rivalry as they pleased between- the
crews, the more the merrier, but that they
wanted no rivalry between the members
cf the same crew. . Thus it was that the
committee decided to have the voting be

city. The selection was to be by ballot
in accordance with the usual custom and
the money collected was to be spent in
decorating the launch, which was to be
styled "the Queen's barge."
On Monday afternoon there will be
sports on the bay, including. sailing and
rowing races, in which the English visi
tors will be invited to participate with
the boys of the Ranger, the Pinta and of
.the Mohican, if that vessel gets in. : The
carnival is planned for that evening,
when there will be a parade- of Illumin
ated launches^ and . barges arid boats
'along the entire city : front, passing all
of the wharves and crossing the , bay. to
circle about .the anchored barge, whence
the fireworks will be set off. This dis
play on the water is to be followed by
the reception and grand ball at Hotel. del
Coronado, lasting until the : sailing time
of the . battleship in the early .morning.
If it Is found on the arrival of the War
spite that she can remain three days,
either the ball or the water, carnival will
be postponed until the following evening.
While the committee has made all the
arrangements for the .reception to the
admiral the plans are so flexible that rf
the Warspite can remain ;more than the
allotted two days the . festivities of the
occasion can be extended that V much
longer. Â¦ The vessel is expected to-morrow

LOUISVILLE, May 4.â Results:
Eastern Haces.
From all accounts the accident resulting
in the death of little "Tim" Moloney was
entirely unavoidable. Eyewitnesses say
Bender, who rode Whangdoodle, made
everv effort to get away from the rail as
Moloney on First Shot broke away. The
remarkable feature is that more accidents
of the kind do not occur.
Reports from the harness brigade at
Pleasanton say Dolly Dillon and Janice,
â¢which two mares will be sold on May 20
at the Fasig--Tipton sale to be held In
Cleveland, Ohio, have been going great
guns. Dolly recently stepped a mile in
2:10V*. last quarter in :30%, which. It Is
claimed, is the fastest mile ever made by
a mare at this time of the year. Janice
went an impressive mile in 2:14. Both are
trained by Millard Sanders.
Track N"otes.
A CARD that bore no traces of rust
or moss, added to a day made pur
posely for racing, drew a large
attendance to Oakland track yes
terday. The talent missed calling
tha turn on five out of six attempts, and
a "rube" didn't have a chance to- last one
sitting out- While those supposed to be
well educated weighed In several . dollars
light when the game was over, the mati
nee bettors landed with such precision
that the bookies did not salt away much.
Such, outsiders of questionable repute as
. Maresa, Jim McCleevy. Jarretierre d Or
and Spike did stunts that were not ex
! peeled of them. For the favorites Head
; -water was the only one to rap out a base
hit. In the way of piloting winners Ruiz
carried off the honors with three, while
from the blackberry patch Bassinger and
Alexander each carne home with one,
"Lorgshot" Conley being absolutely com
pelled to make an absentee of himself.
Something out of the ordinary was ex
pected when the six and a half furlong
Fprlnt. with Headwater, Articulate, The
Â¦ Pride and Sly was called. Articulate was
scratched, which made little difference
: with the betting. The Pride, ridden by
' Conley, vrent to the post favorite, but his
unruly actions caused the odds to recede
'â¢ to 9 to 5, seating Headwater in the chair.
The latter also acted very badly, necessi
tating the removal of his blinkers and the
Â¦ temporary abolishment of the barrier.
Finally Jake Holtman got a break and let
â¢the trio go. First away. Headwater,
nicely rated by Ruiz, was n eve r heÂ£^;f d >
'â¢winning under reefed sails from Sl>. y on "
ley on The Pride, was a busy man from
the kick-off, but was unable to score a

came in for vigorous backing at Â» to 5,
and Just because Conley lingered to make

xo Maresa. an 8 to 1 shot, reduced to J.
Princess Titania ran as if all her royal
cpeed had been pilfered. oI j_/i
Right on top of this came the lopsided
victory of the notorious morning glory.
â¢Jim McCleevy. Previous to yesterday,
during the fcgrgy hours before breakfast,
Jim had broken many watches and count
less horsemen, and then to think he hnally
came through! Inasmuch as Bassinger
vsf up. the desperate ones got aboard
McCleevy at 30, forclne a. cut . to 12. He
led throughout, winning in a drive from
Frank Duffy and The Miller. . Conley on
Formatus became becalmed 3ust before
rounding the stakeboat and Hungarian,
the favorite, stopped to pare his corns
before hitting the wire. If G. W . Miller,
the St.- Louis owner, has any more like
the latter to start he should reserve them
for the new Delmar track, where material
Â°jÂ£rty S Bergen on Rory Ough. favorite
for the two-year-old event over four and
a half furlongs, met with all sorts of ad
verse luck. He was pocketed In behind
Dr Scharff and San Luition to the
stretch, setting through when too late.
Perfectly handled by "Pi" Bulz, Jar
retierre d'Or disposed of San XiUition by
two lengths at the finish. Vasallo, under
etiir unrinir. ran a close third.
Generally fresh and full of speed after
a rest, St. Cuthbert. with AJexanderin
the saddle, won the sprint over the Fu
turity course almost from the start.

: The Metropolitan was the feature of the
opening day's meeting of the Westchester
Racing Association. From noon until the
first race was called crowds poured Into
the ti - ack. and by the time the first classic
fixture of the Eastern racing season- was
run fully 25,000 people were present. A bet
ter day could not have been desired. At
the;. close of the* betting Starbright,
owned by W. C. Whitney, was settled up
on as the favorite at odds of 4 to 1. while
Banastar went to the post at 12 to 1.
The first break was a bad one, Banaster
refusing, but on the second attempt they
got away. In good order and Unmasked
took â¢ up the ; running. .' rushing up the
back " stretch with ..Heliobas close up
heads separating them. Contestor was
the, next In order, while Banastar was
rating along in seventh . place. As the
horses rounded Into the turn of the wlth
era'mlle Odom began to make his move on
Banastar, and as they neared the turn
into the stretch Banastar had mowed the
lot down one by one until he was at the
saddle girths of the flying leaders, and
Odom held him there for the final run
through .the stretch. Around the turn
they came, every one having a clear field
Inch by Inch, urging with his hands'
Odom sent Banastar along until he had
poked his nose in front of Heliobas who
dropped back, beaten. . Then Banastar
went after Contestor.. whom McCue
was driving hard. In the meantime
Green was coming with a rush. Odom on
Banastar, then got to work with whip and
spur. He hung to Contestor's withers for
a moment, , and then, in the last few
Jumps,: Banaster succeeded in poking his
nose in front- and landed the stake for his
new owner by a head. Summary
Mr. Lewishon's confidence did not de
sert him at any period during the twenty
minutes in which the book was being
made.' He felt sure that Mackay's horse
would win, and every wager he made was
bet straight. He paid no attention to odds
laid for place and to show. When the
several horses entered in the race paraded
past the grand stand in review Lewisohn
was still busy placing commissions. He
did not depart from the betting Inclosure
until the cry "They're off!" caused the
bookmakers to rush put to the lawn to
get a view of the struggle. The last wager
of Lewisohn was $100 against $13)0 with
Abe Levy. It was said that Lewisohn's
winnings on the race were upward of
$25,000. - :
NEW YORK, May 4.â The biggest crowd
since Dessara won in 1832 saw Clarence H.
Mackay's Banastar win the Metropolitan
handicap at Morris Park to-day. In a
fierce drive he beat Contestor a head,
while the three-year-old All Green was
third, a length away. The time. 1:42, was
only fair.
The biggest winner on the Metropoli
tan 1 handicap at Morris Park to-day
was Jesse Lewisohn, a well-known
figure about town. In spite of â¢ the
rumors . touching -. upon Banastar's con
dition and the fact that the bookmak
ers increased odds against the Parondal
hcrse, Lewisohn played Mr. Mackay's
representative all over the ring. When
Lev/isohn started to make the circuit of
the rinsr to wager on Banastar the odds
were 20 to 1. At post time the best price
obtainable was 12 to 1. Lewisohn offered
almost every bookmaker in the ring $100
on . Banastar. Nearly every one of the
bigger books accepted, believing that Ban
astar would not finish first.

I "When Cal Ewing wins two baseball
games in succession something is sure to
happen," was what the hammer expert In
the front row said one day last week when
the Dudes left the field bedraggled and
weary. It happened first and then Ewing
won the games, â¢
'Over in Oakland yesterday morning K.
J. Drennan, the guardian of the Oakland
center cemetery, was married to Pauline
Jones, which event bestirred the Oakland
fielder in a very mild way, for he was at
his, post in the afternoon, playing as if
nothing had happened. But then the
courtship was lens and Drennan is a mat
ter-of-fact young man who seldom makes
errors. Â¦ .
That was incident number one. \ nc {~
dent the second, accessory before the fac.
is of another kind. Chief Borchers i3 miss
ing and. desnite the searching of hired
detectives and the hue and cry that Ew
ing has set up, the star twirler of the
Oakland team cannot be found. . The other
day some one saw him with a package of
Eastern transnorlation cards in his
pocket and the Chief 3aid he was going
far, far away, to a land where an umpire
can â¢ be found who knows a ball from a
strike. It is a singular coincidence, the
baseball men say. that one of his lady
admirers is also not to be found. Ewing
will pay a big reward for the return of
Bcrchers, who has already been fined '$100
by the Oakland manager for taking leave
without permission. Ewing would also
like to hand over to Mr. Borchera the
$20 S3 back salary that is due him.
The game yesterday was noteworthy for
the trial of. two new pitchers. Russell of
Oakland and Thomas of Sacramento.
Both give promise of development, par
ticularly Thomas. In the eighth inning
Russell showed that he was made of stern
stuff. Doyle, Stanley and Sheehan were
crowding the sacks and the bench was
clear of dead ones. The score read 5â3 in
favoi of Oakland, and the clouds, hung
over the heads of the Dudes. Then
Thomas hit to Arrellanes and Doyle was
forced out at the plate. McGucken hit to
Moore, who crowded out" Stanley at the
p'att, and Lohman doubled the runner at
first , v
Sacramento at times niayed ragged ball,
which was not helped In the least by the
unnecessary and unreasonable exhibitions

&T1-CHE Mayday festival at Glen Park
I for the benefit of the San Fran-
I Cisco Teachers' Annuity Associa-
II tion was held 'yesterday and was
â¢ a complete success. A most en
joyable day was spent by thousands of
school children and the teachers', annuity
fund was helped to the extent of more
than $6000. Â¦
Not a single happening marred the
pleasure of the day. Although the morn
ing set in cold and foggy, Old Sol sent his
bright rays through the banks of mois
ture long before the noon hour, and more
perfect weather could not have been de
sired. The heat of the sun^was tempered
by a gentle breeze and all went "as merry
as a marriase bell."
There was no need for the parents of the
school children to "call them early" for
the Mayday festival. Long before day
light hundreds of the little ones were astir
and as early as 8 in the morning the cars
to Glen Park were crowded. By 11 o'clock
thousands" of children and their elders
were gathered in the picturesque glen,
and until 6, in the evening there was not
an idle moment. Athletic sports, merry
go-rounds, parades, drills, donkey rides,
automobile spins, balloon ascension,', mu
sic, bands and choruses helped to make
the time fly. Beyond a few lost children
and a slight scare caused by a fire in, one
of the tents,' the Mayday festival was
perfect in every detail. Lieutenant An
derson of the Police Department and fifty
picked men helped to maintain order and
watch over the safety of the thousands of
children, and every credit is due to the
gallant police officers for their efficient
work. Chief Sullivan of the Fire Depart
ment sent a chemical engine to the glen
when he heard of the small fire, and the
firemen were ordered to remain on duty
until the last of the merry-makers had
left for home. The transportation facili
ties of the Market-street Railroad Com
pany were excellent and no difficulty was
encountered in conveying the crowds to
and from the scene of the' festival.
Congressman Kahn Was Popular.
Many distinguished citizens visited the
picnic grounds during the day, but' none
received a warmer welcome than did Con
gressman Julius Kahn and his wife. Con
gressman Kahn was followed by a throng
of boys and girls wherever he went, and
when he scattered money and toys among
the children he was hailed with Juvenile
cheers. . - - â¢ â¢ ' â ,
! All. the familiar faces of the teachers
of the School Department were to be st;en
at the grounds yesterday. President Mrs.
Mary W. Kincaid and Directors Mark,
Casserly and Denman were on " the
grounds. Superintendent R. H. Webster
and his assistant, L. A. Jordan, were here,
there and everywhere, ever thoughtful of
the comfort of the children. The prin
cipals of the various schools end the
male and female teachers lent aid to those
in charge of the festival. . . ,
The ball was set rolling at 9 a. m.. when
Professor 'Alfred Roncovieri and his. su
perb military band gave a concert lasting
for an hour. Then came the athletics of
the high school pupils. George S. Miehl

BORCHERS GOES
INTO SECLUSION
Star Pitcher Drops Out
of Sight "Without
; Warning.
Rumors of Romantic Attrac
tion Surround His
Disappearance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
>/-i - . 111S Broadway, May 4.
George Borchers,' the star pitcher of the
Oakland baseball nine, has disappeared.
Borchers should have played with the
team Wednesday, but he failed to show,
and "Dr." Moskiman was substituted.
None of the missing pitcher's close friends
in baseball circles can explain why he
decamped so suddenly nor where the ab
sent ballplayer has gone.
So far as his baseball standing is con
cerned, Borchers had no reason to leave
the team. His frienas insist that he has
absolutely- no cause on that score for
quitting so unceremoniously, and they are
busy, now trying 'to figure out a satisfac
tory explanation. -
Some of the Oakland players are Inject
ing a bit* of romance into the -story, the
names' of some of the fair enthusiasts of
Golden Gate being, introduced as a pos
sible cause for the handsome pitcher's
sudden leave taking. But none seem to
be able to tell with certainty the story
that he has fallen a victim to the charms
of some fair one and decided to fly to a
Cupid's bower far from. the scenes of his
succesÂ»s at the bay shores.
Borcners is married and his Wife is a
resident of Portland. Or. His former
home was- Sacramento. Inquiring friends
have been unable to trace the pitcher in
any of his former haunts northward.
The friends, however, while somewhat
exercised about the sudden departure, are
not alarmed that Borchers will not be able
to take care of himself wherever he may
be or with whomsoever he may have fled.

The discovery of the remains was made
in a peculiar manner by two boys â Archie
Randall of 1423 Spruce street and Harold
Ray of 1S05 Euclid avenueâ while hunting.
Ray shot at what he supposed to be a
squirrel, but the object did not move and
on investigation he discovered that he
had shot, at one of the feet of a corpse
half hidden in the grass. The boys hur
riedly left the place and reported the
case to Deputy Coroner J. E. Streightif.
Nearly four hours was required to brinj
the body from where it was discovered. It
was lying about three miles from town
and over half way to the top of Grizzly
Peak. The spot was a mile back of "W.
T. Such's dairy and half a mile from the
public road on a steep, open hillside.
The body had on a black frock coat,
dark trousers ard felt slippers. The slip
pers were badly worn, in one place clear
through to the foot, showing how the old
man had struggled over the Jagged rocks.
In the pockets were two cards, both bear
ing the name and address of "Charles F.
Moll." The condition of the body showed
that death had occurred several days ago.
Deputy Coroner Streightif - found no
marks of violence on the body.
Dr. Moll wag seen alive MonÂ«lav, April
22 by W. T. Such at the hearl of Chan
ning way. He seemed in a dazed condi
tion and Such started him toward Oak
land, giving him 50 cents with which to
pay his car fare. Later in the 3av ne was
seen in Strawberry Canyon by a dairy
hand.
Dr. Moll was 76 years of age and
slightly feeble-minded. On a previous oc
casion he wandered away and was gona
three t days. His wife and daughter livÂ«
on Broadway, Oakland, near Forty-ninth
street.
Arrangements for the inquest have not
been made.

Charles F. Moll, the aged Oakland phy

ures were decomt>csed beyond recognition,

name furnished complete identification.

WARLIKE BOYS
IN FATAL STRIFE
During the period between 1895 and 189S,
Â¦when real estate could hardly be riven away,
â¢we dwelt frequently upon the utter want of
faith of buyers. Now, an era has apparently
bfjsun when they will tumble over each other
jr. their eagerness and haste to buy real estate
which they would not touch a few years ago.
The proverb "The time to buy Is when every
body wants to sell, and the time to 6ell is
v-fcen everybody Â¦wants to buy" is never ob
f.r\e& by the crowd, who refuse to touch
property when buying requires courage and
judgment. Xinety-flve buyers out of every
hundred, like children In the dark, must have
company, and large company.
The market is in a very healthy and favor-
The r^al estate business lc In the most active
Ftate, without ary excitement or booming-.
True, several pieces of property, recently
bought, have been sold at advance* of 5 to 10
X-er cent, but that does not indicate specula
tion, but only the presence of a. large number
of buyers, who, at last anxious to buy, are
Â¦wllling to pay reasonable advances. Perhaps
the best sign of general prosperity, as far as
that etate of affairs can be revealed by real
estate, is that email buyer* are now in the
market. They were almost wholly absent be
tween 3891 and 1E93.
The real estate sales during the month
cf April amounted to $3,453,121, as against
? 1,2:5,8:5 in April, 1300. The volume of
business Is thus seen to have increased
r: early threefold in the latter period as
compared with the earlier. The mort
gages last month aggregated $3,015,432, and
the releases footed up $1,743,420.

Each succeeding day adds to the conviction
of shareholders that the Montezuma Mining
Company of Washington has the , brightest
outlook of any newly organized mining com-
pany In the West, or for that matter in the
United States to-day. Our stockholders are
a satisfied lot, and, to the best of our knowl-
edge, not one of them would part with his
holdings. This, in view of the widespread
discontent among the bolders of oil stock, is
a significant fact
The Montezuma Company rigidly adhere,
as they always will, to the co-operative Idea.
This they could well afford to do from pure
selfishness If for no other reason. Now that
the properties are being Wrought to a fair
stage of development and since the large
coal leases have been secured capital is not
lackingâ to secure a controlling interest But
these valuable properties will always remain
under the control of the numerous holders
of Montezuma shares. The people who are
helping to build tip the business may depend
absolutely upon eharing In the profits.
There is every reason to believe that the
Montezuma Mining Company will be to Wash-
ington 'what the Mountain Copper Company
of Shasta. County is to Californiaâ the leader
in the copper Industry and the biggest divi-
dend payer In the State. The Mountain Cop-
per Company was exploited In England and
hundreds of English people profit from its
products, over gLOOO.OOO having been paid in
dividends for 1S00 and $500,000 added to the
reserve fund. It is the fixed Intention of the
Montezuma Company that the people of our
own country be given the exclusive privilege
of contributing to its development fund and
thereby share exclusively in the profits. The
Montezuma has many natural advantages
that the Mountain Copper Company does not
possess. First, its proximity to the seaboard,
being only forty miles from the port of Ta-
coma on Pnget Sound; second, ' a self-fusing
ore carrying high percentages of copper;
third, abundance of timber and water on its
own properties; fourth, the production of Its
_. own. coal . and coka from, its- ' 2000 acres of
leased lands; fifth, the consumption of this
coke in its own smelter in the reduction of
its ores. "Money saved is money earned."
and the Montezuma Company will i be able
to keep operating expenses very low.
We quote from the prospectus: "Resolved,
That It is the fixed policy of this company
to distribute as dividends to stockholders all
set profits earned by the company. ' We are
- opposed to the policy of reinvesting such
earnings without the consent of the stock-
holders, believing that whatever benefits
them conduces to the interests of the com-
pany." Tills means that while dividends
will be paid this fall from the coal and coke,
no portion of the surplus earnings therefrom
can be used to continue development on the
copper properties or for the building of a
smelter. Stock must be sold to accomplish
both these objects. The company's pay roll
Is now approximately $3000 a month, and will
- be -verr largely increased during the sum-
mer. The company cannot, therefore, take
the risk of having their revenue curtailed by
advancing the stock at once to its true values.
It Is for this reason that only a nominal
advance Is made from month to month. The
1 advance after the payment of the promised
dividendâ "but that's another story."
- The price* now, and until May 15, owing to
' a concession made to us by tho Montezuma
Company In honor yt "Presidential week,"
- when many of our country clients plan to
visit us and! Increase their holdings, are lOo

Mary Grant, an incorrigible offendU
escaped punishment yesterday by takir
advantage of a legal blunder. She w
tried and convicted in the United " StatÂ«
District Court on an information chars-
Ing her with selling liquor without an In
ternal revenue license. Yesterday was tha
date fixed for sentence and her attorney
rafsed the point that as the penalty might
be imprisonment in the penitentiary the
offense of which she had been convicted
was. an "Infamous crime" and therefor**
the proceedings against her by informa
tion, Instead of. by an indictment by th*
Grand Jury, was null and void.
Judge da Haven ruled that the> pofn
was well ; taken and discharged the
woman.

LOCAL MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NTTW TORK, May 4.â The stock market
effectually demonstrated its astonishing re
cuperative power again during the' two hours'
trading to-day. The tailing orders which were
thrown upon the market as a result of the
nervous apprehension furnished by yesterday's
violent break were confidently absorbed and
only a momentary break was caused by the
buk statement, although It was more un
favorable than had been expected and the buy
ing afterward Â¦was sufficient to carry prices vio
lently upward throughout the list, obliterating
the Important earlier declines and establishing
eome striking net gains. The closing was
notably strong and at about the top. The ner
vousness aroused by yesterday's weakness ap
parently led some large operators to anticipate
the New York opening by cabling orders to eell
to London. Early quotations from there
Â«howe4 declines of from 2 to 4 points In many
Important American stocks. This level never
was touched In to-da> J1 Â» New York market.
Opening prices were considerably above the
London parity although at declines of from
1 to 2 points from New York's close in many
etoclcs. Atchison opereÂ£ Â«*'ide at an extreme
decline of 2% and Union Paciflc of 4 points.
Keither etock touched the low level again, al
though there were feverish relapses In prices
after the first rally, Atchison closing unchanged
and Union Pacific up 1 point. The aggressive
strength ehown from the outset by St. Paul
Â«Lnd Missouri Pacific had an important influ
ence upon the growing ttrength of the whol-3
market. Â£t. Paul opened % higher and rose
en extreme 7% over lÂ«.Bt night, closing near
the top. Missouri Paciflc opened a point higher
and closed SH higher. Tiiepe movements served
to give eome reassurance to the speculative con
tingent that the process cf absorption of rail
road etocks for consolidation was still going
on. a belief which was somewhat shaken by
the character of celling in Union Paciflc yes
terday. It was argued also that the Interests
doing this buying might have had a hand in
yesterday's collapse in order to facilitate the
operation, as buying railroads for control in
a rampent bull speculation is necessarily an
expensive operation. The lartrc demand from
the ehort interests also- disclosed that bear
operations played a very large part in yes
terday's eelhng. The Improvement in the
technical position of the market by the shak
ing out of weak holdings encouraged the bulls.
There waÂ« very obvious eupport also In the
l tilted stales Steel Etocks. which gained a
point each on the day. Loans made on Friday
carry over until Monday, bo that there were
no actual operations to-day. Money was easier
? h on to -Â°ay, which aroused hopes that
ifi. gn de mand for gold might be relaxed,
ftituough the Continental exchanges etill bear
against London. The bank gtatement seemed
to ue Ignored, although it gave no evidence
?l any . Kain in cash from the Interior to offset
tne Eub-trearury drain, tuch as had been con
noently expected. Continental Tobacco was
strong and advanced 2^
The stock market has again eclipsed all pre
mous records this week with the maximum for
a single day'Â« transactions lifted to 3,202,100
< T* A n Tuesda y and In the minimum for a
tingle day, as high as 2,7M,O00 chares on Wed
ncpday. The total for tlie week was 15,518,200
shares, compared with the previous high record
I I ? e over W.O00.O0O shares during the
week before last. The new records carried
away many inclusi\-e records, such as hourly
business, the totals :n individual stocks, the
clearings of the New York banks and a long
list of prices of etocks. in brief the market
haÂ» been, beyond all precedent in Wall street
as to the arcreeate dimensions of the trading.

KEW YORK STOCK LIST.
speculation which has progressed to this week's
unprecedented stage. The reports circulated
in Wall street of the plans supposed to be
working out -for consolidations have little ad
mitted authority as is inevitable from the ad
vantage to be gained by reticence. Only time
can prove how much of them have a basis in
truth and how much represent pure surmise.
All that can be said Is that they have gained
cumulative power to attract the buying of
stocks and all the world has rushed to Wall
street to buy. The most skillful and expert
Judgment has utterly failed thus far to meas
ure the resources of this buying. All the usual
indications that It was approaching exhaustion
have time and again met with renewed de
mand. There have been periods of heavy, profit
taking and reaction, such as booms usually
culminate â¢with. There have been pinches In
the money market and calling of loans, such
as often times have overturned an airy fabric
of prices reared to much less dizzy heights
than the present. But the new rush of buyers
has reinforced the retiring contingent and
carried prices upward. The prosperous condi
tions now enduring for several years have re
sulted in unprecedented accumulations of
wealth and new capital.
Except for the enormous dealings In Union
Pacific convertible 4s in sympathy with the
stock the bond market has not been extraord
inarily active and prices have moved irregu
larly.
United States 3s declined 1 per cent, the 6s
% and the new 4s and refunding 2s M per cent.
The old 4s advanced % per cent over the clos
ing call of last week. ,^-
the variety of securities dealt In, the astonish
ing movement of prices and the wide extent
of territory which has been represented in
the dealings. In the last named respect it
might also be said that the whole world is
represented in the dealings, cabled orders for
account of London and the Continent figuring
largely in the dealings, as well as from all
points of this country, especially the West.
The most sanguine minded among the profes
sional operators in stocks stand amazed at the
prodigious proportions to which the market has
attained. It is a fact, indeed, that the veterans
in the streets, who have Been through many
booms and panics, have persistently underrated
the future possibilities of the market. They
have largely either refrained from taking part
in the trading, having sold out their holdings
at a lower level, or have persistently sold
short, only to be driven to cover at a loss
by the comprehensive upward sweep of prices.
The novices and Beemlngly reckless and unin
formed plungers have reaped the largest profits
in the great rise in prices. There are well
authenticated reports of large Investment hold
ings brought out by the high level of prices
In the confidence that the early opportunity
would be given to recover the holdings again
at a lower level of prices, and some members
of the exchanges have sold their memberships
at what they considered fancy prices In the
belief that they might return from a brief trip
in Europe and buy th';m back more cheaply.
The current explanation in Wall street of the
violent price movement in Union Pacific is a
case in point. Selling by Insiders at the high
price which the stock had attained was met
by quiet absorption by the interests seeking'
control. The insiders perceiving after a time
that the accumulation cf the stock was going
on attempted to get back their holdings and
the fierce competitive buying which resulted
lifted the price of the stock by leaps and
bounds. This has been the history of so many
stocks recently that the slightest plausible sug
gestion of an effort to buy a railroad in the
open market has brought a rush of hordes of
speculators into the stock affected to share the
benefits. Considering the events of last year
the purchase for consolidation in the anthra
cite field, of the Southern Pacific, the ad
mitted attempt to purchase St. Paul, the suc
cess of the effort to absorb Burlington and
the official denials which accompanied all
these, the excited expectations of speculators
of further similar transactions is not to be
wondered at. The success of one such opera
tion of course adds greatly to the probability
of others. There Is great plausibility in the
Bupposltion that a consolidated control of the
Great Northern, Norlhern Pacific, Burlington
and Erie might lead to the desirability and
almost the necessity of offsetting measures by
the other great Pacific lines, grangers and
Eastern trunk lines. The situation thus pre
cipitated by the action of forceful groups of
capitalists who achieved the Burlington meas
ure has been the mainspring of the enormous
CHICAGO, May 4.â Wheat prices assumed a
weaker position at the start and the remainder
of the session clung to it, as the degrees of
sentiment " were not sufficiently pronounced â¢' to
lead to active trading. July opened %@%c to
%@%c lower, at 72%@73%c, sold between 72%@
72%c and 72%c and closed '' - lower, at 72%@
72%c. At the start local bears and longs sold
liberally, but the short interest was a timid
one, bearing in mind the readiness with which
the market has recently responded to encour
agement. With the bears in Â¦ this mood, the
longs having no tempting profits in sight, the
trade evened up their deals in order to rest
over Sunday with undisturbed rninds and then
left the market to take care of itself. The drop
in prices was due to weak cables, glowing crop
reports, lack of outside Interest in the market
and to sympathy with the corn decline. '
' July corn received a severe poundine, while
the May deal was neglected generally. In the
way of legitimate news weak cables were Influ
ential, but the main factor in the decline of
July; was heavy selling by the man who has
cornered the May. corn. He said the market
needed a break and accordingly disDosed of
2,500,000 bushels of July. In view of this and
other selling the decline was very moderate.
The close was steady. %c lower, at 46%c. May
corn closed 2%c down at 53c.
Oats were lalrly active and firm. July oats
closed }ic lower at 26%c. . â¢
Provisions were affected by .the liberal run of
hogs and the drop in 'prices for them at the
yards. Trade, was dull and unimportant. July

CLOSING.
Ix EW YORK, May 4.â The Commercial Adver
tiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were generally easier to
day, though' fairly active. Americans again
monopolized attention. They opened well under
parity and generally speaking there was no
rally, the close being Hat at from 1@3 points
under New York's closing; prices of yesterdav
Union Pacific and the Atchisons were the weak
est features. The market was on the whole far
less excited under the weakness than It had
been recently during the rise. It Is generally
believed that weak traders have been weeded
out and strong buying is. reported. Conservative
bulls say the slump puts the market In a much
healthier condition than It was' before Manv
operators here think that the break was due
to a. concerted movement, the object of which
was to discourage wild speculation It la
thought, too, that the bad statement in New
York has been discounted. Money was easy
London Market.
The Financier says: As a result of the ex
ports of gold during the week the . Associated
Banks of New York in their current statement
show a falling- oft of $5,199,400 in cash holdings
and this, coupled with increased reserve re
quirements necessitated by an expansion In de
posits, brought the surplus down to I10.SS0.100, a
loss of $5,779,675, as compared with the previous
week. The statement is not to be classed as an
unfavorable one, although, as a matter of fact,
it . shows heavier decreases in cash than had
been expected. It is to be inferred that the
condition of the banks is better than shown
by the totals, for the reason that Government
disbursements for May interest and bond pur
chases do not show fully, while the losses of
the banks do. In their operations with the in
terior the clearing-house institutions gained
over two millions, while the losses to the treas
ury did not exceed five millions, so that a fair
estimate of cash reduction does not exceed three
millions. The loan expansion of $6,005 500 Is
moderate, considering the violent speculation
of the week, and it would have been heavier
had it not been for the policy of some banks
in contracting their loans, both as a matter of
precaution and for other reasons. The result
of the rise In loans and decrease in cash is seen
in a moderate rise of $2,321,100 In deposits The
situation at present centers around the possi
bility of continuous exports of gold It is esti
mated that nearly or quite one hundred millions
of the new English bonds will come to the
United States. The first installment has already
been made. Another, involving possibly five
millions, will fall due about May 17 but If in
dications count for anything the greater portion
of the subsequent settlements will be arranged
for u b y c 1 redI t transfers rather than in actual
cash. This will relieve the position of the banks
so far as immediate cash reserves are con
cerned, but even as Jt is there seems to be noth
ing in the situation to call for anxiety relative
to the money market. The continued receipts of
funds from the interior, traceable both to firm
rates here and speculative buying, reveals the
ability of the country to supply funds for all
needed purposes. It need not be said, how
ever, that the whole superstructure rests now
as never before, on a continuance of the pres
ent feeling of confidence; .r
Loans $890,450,000, Increase $6,005,500; deposits
$973,111,600, increase $2,621,100; circulation $31.;

ASTORIA, Or., May 4.â The jury in the

charged with having violated the Proeb
stel nickel-in-the-slot machine law. to
night returned a verdict of not guilty.
Mr. Madison represented all of the local [

which recently began a moral crusade.
Reformers Lose Test Case.
sworn out hero late this afternoon for the
arrest of Federal Quarantine Officer J. J.
KInyoun, who , Is accused of the crime of
assault to murder. Joseph de Wolfe of
TIburon Is the complainant.
De Wolfe came to this city this after
noon and related a strange story to Jus
tice of the Peace Rodden. According: to
his tale the fact that he is now alive is
due only to the poor marksmanship of
KInyoun. Last November, while rowing
past tbe quarantine station. on Ansel Isl
and, De Wolfe says KInyoun stepped to
the edge of a high bluff and with a maga
zine rifle fired a volley of eight shots at
him. The bullets splashed in the water
around -his boat, the spray drenching . his
clothing. Several nf tbe . bullets passed
very close to him. One chipped the sail
cf his boat. All of the shots, according
lo his story, were fired with murderous
deliberation.
At the first shot De Wolfe turned his
boat from â¢ the direction of .Tiburon,
whither he _was going, and headed for tho
main shore opposite. This, however, did
not etop the vollay,'- according Â¦ to De
Wolf e. - ; KInyoun - seemed enamored with
his man-behind-the-gun act and the dead
ly hail of bullets drilled the air around
De Wolfe. Â¦'Â¦Â¦..
When asked if he was within the bounds |
of the quarantine station De Wolfe said |
that he was" not; -that he was 'acquainted j
with the station and its boundaries, and
was not on, forbidden water .when his life
was attempted. He declared that he clear
ly recognized Dr. Kinyoun as the shooter.
He has seen. the doctor many. times and is
well acquainted with his. appearance. De
Wolfe further said that, after .emptying
his rifle, Dr. KInyoun calmly- reloaded the
weapon and acted as though he was go
ing to continue the bombardment. De
Wolfe claims that the reason this was not
done was that a large number. of people
in boats and launches were â¢ spectators,
their attention having been attracted by
the shooting.
Explaining why he did not cause Kin
youn's arrest at the time. De Wolfe said
le was ignorant of the law and supposed
that he would have to bear the -expense
of the prosecution. As he had a family
he could not afford this.
De Wolfe is a deaf mute and his story
was told wltH his pencil. At first Judge
Rodden refused to issue a warrant, but
upon the advice of acting District Attor
ney" E. B. Martlnelll.' who heard De
Wolfe's story, the warrant was issued and
placed in the hands of Constable George
Agnew, who went- to San Francisco -to
night to effect a service. Bail Is fixed in
the sum of $2000.
Deputy Constable Agnew came' over
from San Rafael last evening to serve. the j
warrant on Dr. Kinyoun. but was unable ;
to find a Police Judge or Justice of the j
Peace to indorse the warrant. Dr. Kin- i
youn had planned to leave for the East j
on the 8 o'clock overland last evening, j
"but was not able to complete his arrange- !
ments and so postponed his departure un- j
til to-morrow. The warrant will be served j
to-morrow.

Calif ornlan. Attorney Henry C. Dibble
appeared . for her yesterday morning: be
fore United States Court Commissioner
Heacock and produced a certificate of reg
istration with the photograph of the ap
plicant. The photograph was very much
faded and it was doubtful whether It was
that of the defendant until the original
certificate In the office of Collector of In
ternal Revenue ' was brought Into court
when it was shown beyond a doubt that
she was the person named In the certi
ficate.. â¢ ...j'. ."Â«.
It was proved, however, 1 that the woman
had sone under different names and that
she had stated immediately after her ar
rest that she was born in China * It was
shown also that she arrived In this city
on the Oceanic in; March. 1894. and waa
admitted on her : claim that she waa a
native of this country.
Judge Heacock took the case under ad
visement and in the meantime United
States District Attorney Woodworth will
Institute proceedings for the cancellation
of the certificate of .registration on tha
ground that it was obtained by fraudu
lent representations^ It having become ap
parent that the -woman* waa not in this
