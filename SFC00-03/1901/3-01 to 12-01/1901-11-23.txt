(Ckeert.)â Excerpt from speech by Congressman Woods at Chinese
Exclusion Convention.
STRONG SPEECHES
TO THE DELEGATES
Sentiments Favoring Protection to
American Labor Are Wildly
Cheered.
THE Chinese Exclusion Convention
completed its labor? yesterday
after the adoption of one <>f the
most important as well as vipor
ous memorials on the Chinese
question ever addressed to the
President and Congress of the United
Elates. The attitude of the people of Cal
ifornia and of the entire Pacific Coast to
ward the problem of unrestricted immi
gration of Asiatics to these shores as rep
resented in the convention was distinctly
outlined, and its language cannot fail to
he understood in the East as being the
Fpontaneous outburst of a united people
n the imposition upon them i f a
grievous wrong.
The delegates gathered in force yester
day morning and listened with enthusi
asm to many speakers. Only one theme
was discuss-ei, only one idea advanced,
namely, unalterable resistance to the pro
ject of unrestricted Chinese immigration
to America. Tie danger of a Mongolian
invasion In the event of the refusal of
. :ess to re-enact the exclusion law
wae pointed out in forceful language by
all the speakers. The delegates choc-reel
heartily at every patriotic sentiment
voiced by the orators, and particularly
when the necessity o* protecting Ameri
can labor against foreign competition was
urged. The members of the convention
.6howed by their zeal t^at they were in
accord with the speakers, whose senti
ments they cordially indo-f>ed.
The report of the comir.ittee on perma
nent organization was tae first matter
to engage the attention of the delegates
et the morning session. The recommen
dation that the temporary officers be
made permanent was adopted amid
cheers. It was expected that the memo
l rial committee would be abl* to file its
report, but the announcement by Chair
man Geary that further time was re-
Quired by the cotimittee resulted in the
desired action beltg taken. There being

speechmaking was indulged in. Assistant
Tnii^rj States District Attorney Duncan
E. McKinlay was introduced by the chair,
and that gentleman delivered an able ad
dress in which he reviewed the Chinese
question from the standpoint of the Dis
trict Attorney's office. The legal aspects
of the issue were capably presented, the
peakcr's remarks at times evoking
hearty applause. So favorably did he im
press his hearers that at the close of his
speech he was honored by a Tote of
thanks for his brilliant oratorical effort.
The Rev. Dr. William Rader followed
with a witty address, in which he re
viewed the Chinese question from the
standpoint of morality and religion. His
allusions to the vices prevailing in San
Francisco's Chinatown, and of their ef
fect upon the whole community, were im
pressively advanced, and his remark that
the proper place in which to Christianize
the Chinese was in China and not in this
country, evoked cheers. The address
was replete with statistical information,
and it was listened to with profound in
terest by all present.
Congressman Woods carried away the
banner by a characteristic speech in
which he informed the convention "that
with its assistance all hâ l couldn't beat
the exclusion law." Woods was in deep
earnest, and all his utterances were ac
companied by vigorous gestures and a
beating of the rostrum with a vigor that
threatened to convert it into kindling
wood. He assured the convention that
the California delegation in Congress
would never give up the exclusion fight,
and when he sought to close what he
termed his "razzle-dazzle" address, the
crowd yelled lustily for more. Woods
obliged the delegates further, and when
he concluded the delegates gave him three
hearty cheers.
The closing address of the morning ses
sion was by Mayor Snyder of Los An
geles. During the afternoon the repre
sentatives of various labor organizations

RE-ENACTMENT OF THE EXCLUSION
LAW IS DEMANDED BY CONVENTION
J yf / HERE AS , The Chinese exclusion act, known as the "Geary law," will expire by limitation
py May 24, 1902; and
Whereas, The treaty betzveen this country and China concerning the restriction of
immigration from the latter nation may, under its provisions, expire on March j, 1904; and
Whereas, The roils that produced the necessity for the enactment of the present exclusion lazy,
and the making of the present treaty with China, still exist in our midst, and dangers therefrom are
as imminent nozv as they were when the present barrriers zvere established; and
Whereas, Unless such barriers are maintained and vigorously guarded the invasion of
Chinese laborers, thereby checked, zvill expose our people to a renewal thereof, with all its influences
inimical to the interest of our zvage-earncrs and injurious to the general zvelfare; and
Whereas, The beneficial results flozving from the operation of the said act have met the expec
tations of the people in avoiding an increase of Chinese immigration and an aggravation of the many
ez'ils thereof, therefore be it
Resolved, By the Chinese Exclusion Convention of the State of California, composed of three
thousand delegates representing the State, county and city governments and industrial and civic or
ganisations in all parts of the State,
First â That we demand the continuance of existing treaties ziith China and the re-enactment
of the "Geary exclusion law" ,
Second â That we recommend that the California delegation in Congress act unitedly in the
presentation of the bill to accomplish the purpose hereinbefore set forth and use their utmost endeavor
to secure its immediate enactment into lazy.
delivered brief addresses. Dr. William
son, president of the Board of Health,
talked, of the Chinese curse in San
Francisco and frequently evoked ap
plause. Mr. Taylor of the State
Grange spoke in behalf ef the farmers
of California, and in a logical speech
showed the evil effects unrestricted im
migration of Chinese to California, would
exert upon rural pursuits in this State.
The main event of the afternoon session
was the reading and adoption of the me
morial to President Roosevelt and to
Congress. Prior to the filing of the re
port of the committee Supervisor Reed's
motion that a committee be appointed to
wait upon Rev. Father Peter C. Yorke
with the request that he address the coo
vention was carried, and Reed was de
tailed for the task. A motion to ad
journ just before Rev. Mr. Yorke's
arrival was voted down, and when
the clergyman appeared he was warmly
greeted. He spoke at some length, and at
the conclusion of his speech several mo
tions of more or less importance were
made and carried. The convention then
adjourned sine die.
FARMERS GIVE SUPPORT.
BIT, representative* of American labor liere assembled. I
think I can say to yon that yon will find yon have a firm
friend and supporter In the American farmer on this Issue,
and when the American farmer thoroughly understands
this subject yon need not fear the result. The American farmer
Is no fool. He knows that his best and greatest market Is the
home market, and he knows also that his best customer and his
best friend Is the well-paid, well-housed, well-clothed and well
fed American working-man. The refore, worktngmen of California,
let your voice be heard on this snbject with no uncertain sonnd,
and I feel assured that the farmers of this State and nation will
rnlly to yonr standard and carry It, like onr boys In the late
Spanish wnr did theirs, to complete and glorious victory.â Ex

LEGAL ASPECTS OF
THE CHUTESE QUESTION
Brilliant Address by Assistant United
States District Attorney Duncan
E. McXinlay.
D. E. ITcKinlay, Assistant United
States Attorney for the District of Cali
fornia, was introduced to the convention
and delivered a stirring and forcible ad
dress. He enlightened the delegates on
the scope of the Geary act. He had many
wise suggestions, and his remarks were
listened to with deep "interest. In pa-t
he said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: I apprehend that the invitation extended
by the managers of this convention, to tho
United States Attorney's office to participate
In these proceedings arose from a desire on
the part of the managers to place before the
convention the data and the information
which that office could furnish concerning: the
practical operation of the Chinese exclusion
law.
As to the desirability of the re-enactlon of
the Chinese exclusion laws there can be no
que3tion.
This great convention â composed of delegates
from every part of our commonwealth of Cali

Industry, every profession, trade and business
this convention itself, I say, voices in most
eloquent terms the unanimity of sentiment
which prevails throughout all our State,
among every class of our citizens concerning
the absolute necessity for the re-enactment of
Â«aws which shall exclude In the future, even
mere effectively than they have excluded in
the past, Chinese and other Asiatic people from
our State and nation.
I need not expiatiate upon the evils of
Asiatic immigration to our shore*. All who
have eyes may see the blighted corrupting in
fluence which the Orientals have had on our
business Interests and our commerce; how they
have degraded our laborâ for American labor
can never compete IB the same market with
Asiatic labor and maintain for one moment its
dignity and self respect; how the presence of
Orientals in our city and State, with their de
graded habits and practices, has poisoned the
pure springs of morality and religion, and cor
rupted by Its evil Influence all our social life.
All these subjects will be dwelt upon by
eloquent, earnest, thoughtful speakers, and as
a result of the work of this convention, a reso
lutions will be passed and measures will be
suggested which will be a sure guide to our
delegates in Congress concerning the form of
legislation demanded by the Pacific Coast for
the protection of its future.
Gentlemen, the United States District Attor
ney 1 office has had, in one sense of the word.
as n.ueh to do with the practical workings of
the Chinese exclusion laws as any other depart
ment of the Government, for since the -pas
sage of the law of May 6. 1882 (the first act < f
Congress excluding the C'.i:nese) every crack
end cranny of the lays have been probed by
skillful lawyers in the pay of the Chinese to
widen, if possible, the perjure so that a Chi
riTTUjTi might crawl through"; every link in the
chain which guarded us has been tested and
strained to the utmost In the hope that one
link would break; every point, every quibble
known to the law has been raised in our courts,
in behalf of the Chinese by the best legal tal
ent of California, to distort the plain intention
of Congress and find some means by which ex
clusion might be evaded. And on the United
States District Attorney's office. In all the
rears since IS$2 the duty has devolved of guard
ing In the United States courts the legal rights
of Americans.
The experience of that office, after its twenty
years of continual warfare against the persist
ent efforts of the Asiatics to enter despite the
exclusion laws, must be worth something to this
â¢on vent lon.
At this time it Is unnecessary to attempt to
â¢kplain the porvisions of the laws passed by
Congress for the exclusion of the Chinese.
Commencing with that of May 6, ISS2, each law
passed as time went onâ that is. the law of
July 5. ISS4, of September 13, 1888, the supple
ment to the law of May 6, 18S2, passed October
I. 1668 the so-called Geary act of May 5. 1852.
and the act of November 3. 1893â drawn
more strictly and more in conformity with
Etrict exclusion principles than the one which
preceded It. The Geary act, or the law of May
6, 1882. continued in force and effect all laws
excluding Chinese upon the statute books at
that time, and in addition the principal provi
sion of the Geary law required the registration
of all Chinese in the country, whereby they
might be Identified as those who had a right
to be and remain in America under the former
laws.
The. Geary act continued in force the exclu
sion laws for ten years after its passage, so
that by the terms of this act all Chinese ex
clusion laws will expire on May 3, 1902. So the
question before us to-day is not what the old
law. was; what its merits or demerits were. Its
strength or its weakness, but what the new law
.Â«ball be. The purpose of this convention is to
consider - how a Tfew exclusion law 'may be
framed so as to avoid the weakness- and defects
of the old la we, and place upon the statute
books of the nation an absolute barrier against
Chinese and other Asiatic immigration.
Fortunately California is blessed at this time
with nine able, . honest and earnest Cottgress
men and -Senators, and one of whom is perfect
ly capable of framing a bill which will meet
all requirements of our necessities, but still it
will be a source of strength and power to- them
to know that the whole State is behind Â£hem
and with Â¦ themâ giving them encouragement in
the battle whose -brunt will fall upon them
-when they meet in Washington the coming
Â¦winter.
It is the opinion of the United States District
'Attorney's office that the provisions of the
Geary law should be substantially re-enacted in
the new measure. Of course ten years of the
operation of the Geary law have demonstrated
that improvements must be made; ten years of
Â¦effort on the part of the Chinese to break
through that law have shown that there are
places In it that must be 6trengahened, and
loopholes that must be closed. in order that a
perfect exclusion law shall be placed on the
books of the nation.
For instance, it is suggested that the Bureau
of Immigration of the Treasury Department
should be made the original Judge of the eligi
bility of Chinese persons and persons of Chi
nese descent to enter the United States, and
that such bureau be authorized to make all nec
essary regulations to enforce the administration
of such Jaws.
This, of course, would not affect the rights
of Chinese persons or persons of Chinese de
scent, claiming to have been born within the
United State*.
Â¦ An appeal from the decision of the Immi
gration or customs officer should be permitted
to the Secretary of the Treasury. The decision
of the immigration or customs officer should
be final, unless reversed by appeal to the
Secretary of the Treasury.
â¢ If .this provision should become . a part of
thÂ« new law, Its terms should be especially
clear and strong and unambiguous, for a great
question is now before the Federal court* of
. this city for a decision. It .is the . question
of the rights of Chinese in transit through the
country. Of late Chinese have been coming In
large numbers, en route to Mexico. Of course
tinder the laws as they are, the transporta
tion companies are required to take precau
tions to carry the Chinese persons en route
safely through, ana guard against their escape
y.hile in the United States, but once over the
Ifexican line all responsibility on the part
#f the transportation company ceases, and the
Chinaman at once leaves the train on Mexi
can soil, learns a little of our language and
Â«uÂ«toÂ»s, and some dark night, aided by white
jnen wbo are in the business of assisting Chi
nese to evade exclusion, he quietly slips across
the borders and become a good American
Chinaman.
The 'collector's of the ports of entry should
hare the power of ruling whether the Chinese
In transit are bona fide travelers en route, or
whether they are merely entering the United
States to cross to the nearest point In foreign
DUTY OF EVERY CITIZEN.
I REGARD it as the sacred duty of every American citizen to
discharge faithfully hi* political obligations to his country, a
country every foot of whose soil ha been consecrated to the
cause of liberty by the precious blood of a heroic people. It is
the duty of every American to see to it that the duplicity of Ori
ental corruptionlsts shall not defile public sentiment and that
the American people do not consent to legislation by the National
Congress that Trill permit the contamination of our soil by. an
influx of hordes of the lowest type of humanity. I say that it is
our duty as American citizens to fearlessly face this great prob
lem and to stamp out once and for all time this threatened dan
ger of unrestricted Chinese immigration. We are assembled here
to contribute to the preservation and elevation of a clear Ameri
can sentiment that trill bring the blush of shame to the faces of
all who advocate the opening of our doors to a flood of creatures
who believe in no government unless It 'be despotism.â

territory, there to leave the railroad or ves
sel and return.
The point is this: If the Collector has rea
son to suspect that the real purpose of the
Chinaman is to ultimately work his way Into
the United States, he should be empowered to
refuse the landing in the first instance, and
his ruling should be final, unless the best of
evidence be given* to show the contrary. Of
course in this class of cases an appeal should
be given to the Secretary of the Treasury, but
pending the appeal the Chinaman should be
held without bonds.
This is an Important phase of the Chinese
problem. Mexico is becoming more quiet
along the border; the turbulent Indian tribes
are being well, controlled by both American
and Mexican Governments, and it Is now safe
lor the Chinese to use that route and .method
in reaching their desired goal, while it v.as
dangerous and difficult but Just a few years
ago.
It is reported on eood authority that a com
pany of Chinese merchants and Americans in
terested In the importation of Chinese has
been formed in San Francisco for the purpose
of establishing and building up a colony of
one million Chinese on the border of Mexico.
The principal business of that colony will be
to work Its members over the American bor
der.
Again: United States Commissioners should
be vested with plenary jurisdiction to deter
mine the status of Chinese persons or per
sons of Chinese descent within the United
States, or of having failed to register while
in the United States, as required by law.
The laws on this subject are. If not open to
question, at least debatable. 3
There are at least four or five enactments
which vest United States Commissioners with
jurisdiction to order the deportation of Chi
nese persons and persons of Chinese descent
found to be unlawfully within the United
States.
There is considerable question whether sec
tion 13 of ttie act of September 13, 1888. ever
became a law, and it is under that section
that United States Commissioners as a rule
proceeed originally with reference to dtpor
tation proceedings, and that an appeal by the
Chinese persons is allowed to i the United
States District Court.
Certain verbiage used in section 6 of the act
of May 6. 1892, as amended by the act of No
vember 3, 1893, would afford some ground for
the argument that the status of Chinese per
sons charged with being unlawfully within the
United States, by reason of their failure to
register, should be tried originally and ex
clusively by a United States Judge, meaning
thereby a Judge or a United States court.
The tendency of the courts has been to give
the United States Commissioner full and ple
nary Jurisdiction of all cases relating to the
unlawful status of Chinese persons and persons
of Chinese descent, irrespective of whether that
unlawful status was brought about by an orig
inal and unlawful entry into the United States
or the original entry being unlawful was after
ward rendered unlawful by failure to register,
as required by law.
Therefore there should be In the new Chinese
exclusion law a particular enactment giving
United States commissioners full and unques
tioned Jurisdiction In determining the status
of all Chinese persons and persons of Chinese
descent within the United States. :
Furthermore, a very necessary amendment to
the law would be that granting an appeal iby
the United States. As the. law stands at pres
ent the Chinese person only is allowed an ap
peal. The United States has no remedy by
appeal. ' Â¦
The new law should further provide that with
reference to habeas corpus proceedings no bail
should be allowed. This Is a very salutary
provision. It tends to expedite i the action of
persons suing out writs of habeas corpus,
otherwise, as It has occurred In the past, the
Chinese will sue out writs of habeas corpus
and obtain protracted delays; meanwhile earn
ing a livelihood In the country. , ** .*
It is alto suggested that a new registration
of all Chinese i persons or persons of Chinese
descent within the United States should be
provided for. â¢ Â¦ . .â¢ , .
Since the last registration law of May 5,
18?2. as amended by that of November 8, 1898,
under which the period of registration expired
on May 4. 1894. now nearly seven years ago. a
great many Chinese have, by eluding the vig
ilance of officers, fraudulently and unlawfully
entered the confines of the United States and
are now within the country as laborers.
And again. The penal laws relating to the
enforcement of the Chinese exclusion and re
striction acts should be somewhat reformed and
rendered more effective. â¢ *.; .;â¢; Â¦ - Â¦ Â¦Â¦
For instance it is made an offense to aid and
abet the landing of Chinese. The courts have
held, under the peculiar phraseology Â¦ of the
present law. that unless the landing of a
Chinaman be successful the offense is not con
summated. The law should be emended so
that an attempt to aid or abet the landing of
Chinese persons, whether successful or not
should be made an offense.
The laws with reference to the taking of
oaths and authorizing customs officers and
others to. administer oaths should be Improved
upon so that prosecutions for perjury might be
had.
Some suggestion has also been made that a
Chinese laborer should be permitted to bring
over his wife. - This is an exceeding em
barrassing question, for the reason that It
would be made the means of a treat deal of
fraud; that Is. under the guise of bringing
women over as wives many women would be
brought over for Immoral purposes. '-Â¦Â¦:Â¦". Â¦â¢ Â

descent (not citizens of the United States)
who have been convicted of crimes, should be
so amended as to Include those who are here
after convicted of a folony, as well as those
who have been previously convicted thereof
Ab the law at present stands only those who
are convicted of a felony by the act of May
5, 1592. could be deported.
In habeas corpus proceedings, where the Chi
nese persons claim to have been born in the
United States, the widest discretion should be
given the Judge or Commissioner In his rul
ings on the credibility of witnesses and the
admission of the evdence.
To Illustrate this: Take the proceedings in
the Commissioner' 8 Court almost any morning.
A Chinaman is before the Commissioner on a
Tvrit of habeas corpus; his attorney claims
that he was born in the United States; the
Chinaman does not claim it; he doesn't know
enough about our lansuage or customs to
claim anything; but, nevertheless, there are
a number of Chinese who can be found who
will testify that they knew the applicant's
father and mother twenty or twenty-five years
ago; that applicant waF born at 710 Dupont
street, on the third floor, in room No. 13;
that when the boy was 2 years old he was taken
to China by his mother to be educated; that
he has lived in China ever since that time
that now his mother is dead and his father
Is dead and he wants to come back to his
native America to take care of the business
of his old uncle or cousinâ and the uncle or
cousin is there to swear to it.
So common is this story, Â«so well Is It learned
and so carefully is It presented In evidence In
the courts, that one of the Federal Judges es
timated that if the story were true every Chi
nese woman who was in the United States
twenty-five years ago must have had at leabt
500 children.
Therefore the new law should give the United
States Commissioners the widest range in ad
mitting Chinese testimony. The newspapers of
this city have paid a great deal of attention
to the question of slavery, and the public have
come to know through the efforts of the press
that here in this free land, in the city of Sin
Francisco, under the very shadow of the flafc
that is the hope, the inspiration and the glory
of all who love liberty and rejoice in freedom,
human chattels are bought and sold, bartered
and exchangedâ yes, in the very market place
And there is no Federal law on the statute
books to reach and remedy this evil ; and so the
new Chinese exclusion law must be framed to
wipe out the last vestige of slavery on Ameri
can soil.
To learn this may astonish many, but It is
a fact nevertheless. At present there Is no
law relating to the question of slavery, unless
it relates to negroes, mulattoes or foreigners
therefore, with reference to Chinese slave girls
who claim to have been born in the United
States, thfere is no penal statute by which
their owners can be prosecuted. All that can
be ddne in attempting to break up the Invol
untary servitude of Chinese girls held for im
moral purposes Is to arreÃt the unfortunates
on the charge that they are unlawfully In the
United States and deport them should they
fail to establish their right to be here; but
if they establish their American nativity there
is no Federal statute which will compel their
owner to release them. This phase of the Chi
nese problem requires the careful attention of
our lawmakers when they are considering the
new exclusion act.
In conclusion I wish to say again that we
can Justly feel every confidence in the states
manship and honesty and ability of our Con
gressional delegation. They will frame the new
exclusion law and frame It, I am sure as
wisely as human wisdom can. But this con
vention can voice the heartfelt prayer of all
California tl-at the East may Join with the
West and In the coming session of Congress

shall guard and protect from the blight

EFFECT OF IMMIGRATION
UPON THE PUBLIC MORALS
Key. William Eader Entertainingly
Discusses the Absorbing
Chinese Problem.
Rev. William Rader, pastor of the Third
Congregational Church, was the next
epeaker. He dwelt upon the effects of
Chinese immigration on public morals.
The address was witty and forceful. It
follows:
It may appear to our fellow citizens in the
East that the people of California are violat
ing their sacred faith in the brotherhood of
man by resisting the immigration of Chinese.
Standing as the nation has so many years
for the brotherhood of man, inviting the
alien races of the earth to seek shelter and
refuge under our flag, it may be asked if we
in the West are turning the hands back en
the face of our national policy and repudiat
ing the Burllnghame treaty of 1868, confessing
that we are not equal to the task of chris
tianizing the races of the world.
W e are not opposing immigration because we
do not like the Chinese. Indeed, many of us

have become attached to this picturesque Ori
ental on our streets and in our kitchens, who,
like Tennyson's Maud, 1b "icily regular, splen
didly null." It Is not a question of reilg
lcn. Our country is free to faith, provided
faith be true to freedom and republican Insti
tutions. Neither is it a question of human
rights. Immigration is not a right, but a
privilege. The enjoyment of American liberty
Is not a right, but a privilege, conditioned by
the capacity to exercise such a prerogative. It
Is quite within the power of the state to regu
late such national privileges. This has been
the policy of European governments for hun
dreds of years. It is the prerogative and pol
icy of the United States, to be exercised not
only in accordance with International good
will, but in defense of national well being, in
protection of commerce, the workingmen and
national morality.
This, then, is a question of method, as to
how the industrial and social Integrity of the
republic may be served and maintained. This
great convention meets in the name of Ameri
can patriotism, and notÂ« with one word of
race prejudice. The Issue is that of American
civilization as against the venerable paganism
of China, with the hope that the one may be
protected, that the other, In the progress of
light and liberty may ultimately be destroyed
and become civilized.
Three main arguments are used to support
Chinese exclusion. The arguments of Indus
try, of political economy and of morality. I
have been asked to speak upon the last.
Through our gates have come the down-trod
den, the Italian, and the Swede, the German
and the Pane and all Â¦nationalities. "We have
bled and died for the blacks. Here in San
Francisco we are not by any means morally
perfect. We have troubles of our own. Whlta
vice is as evil as yellow vice, and it is because
of this that we see danger in unlimited Immi
gration. Humiliating as It may seem Chris
tian America is not equal to t>agan China.
San Francisco is not equal to Chinese immor
ality. Is Boston or New York or Chicago equal
to the task of assimilating Chinese populations'
with American standards? Says a Chinese pro
verb, "The light of heaven cannot Bhlne into
an inverted bowl." The Chinese in the United
States are an inverted bowl. Henry "Ward
Bcecher said, "When the lion eats the ox, the
ox becomes the lion; not the lion, ox." It has
been well said In reply that if there be too
much ox, or if he be poisoned, ye have a dead
lion as a result.
China Is the ox. America Is the lion. As
well might a mouse try to digest an elephant
as America to digest China. There is too
much Chlna^a China of many centuries, of
four hundred millions, of fixed traditions and
vices. You cannot empty the Pacific Into a
cup. This is what advocates of unlimited Im
migration would try to do. .
What are the facts?
The present number of Chinese in the United
States may approximately be put down at
100,000. Of these 18,000 are in San Francisco,
54,000 on the Pacific Coast outside of San Fran
cisco, .and 28,000 In other States and Terri
tories'. It is estimated that the whole num
ber of Chinese professing the Christian faith
is about 1600. It is claimed that more than
2000 attend evening schools, that the number
in missions and public schools equal 500 and
that $60,000 has been given by the Chinese for
the building of chapels and for Christian work.
I may venture the opinion, however, that In
the face of these figures it is the opinion of
Christian workers among the Chinese that the
proper place to civilize the race is not here,
but in their own country.
We have failed to christianize the Chinese
population of California. From a moral point
of view the Chinaman has not been a success
In the United States, which is to say, he has
not assimilated with American institutions
and Ideals. He has planted orchards, built
railroads, washed linen and prepared dinners
for $30 or $40 a. month, but has signally failed
to become a moral American force. His nega
tive virtues have never become positive In
fluences.
This is true largely because he is the im
migrant without a home. He is a man with
out a fireside. Other immigrants have brought
hither their wives and children, for whom
they have sacrificed. The cabin and the
school, the church and the library followed,
and some of the best blood In America flowr
in their veins.
They have become pillars of the republic,
but the Chinese are a homeless people. Co*
sequently they have imperilled their environ
ment, and the Influence of their lives has not
been good. The Scotch have given us con
science, the Italian artistic taste, the French
man wit, the English piety, the Scandinavia*
industry, but the Chinese have made no perma
nent gifts to American life. He has con
tributed nothing to the moral or social fibw
of the republic. He has left no art, no sci
ence, not even his fortune or his bones. Hi*
has taken millions from our gold fields. H>
has not left anywhere a permanent dollar.
No man is a moral force in the United State*
who takes away his money and his skull.
A few years ago the Board of Supervisor*
of this city made an Investigation, when It.
was shown that 30,000 Chinese lived within a
space comprised in eight blocks: Fifty-seven
women and fifty-nine children living as fami
lies; 761 women and 576 children herded to
gether with apparent indiscriminate partntal
relatives and no family classification so far
as could be ascertained: 576 prostitutes and
eighty-seven children, professional prostitutes
and children living together.
There were 103 houses of prostitution, 150
iron-clad barred and barricaded gambling
dens, twenty-six opium Joints existing in de
fiance of municipal laws and of police authori
ty. In habitations sufficient for 250 persons
the committee found 823 actual sleeping occu
pants.
The conditions are practically the name to
day.
Chinatown furnishes the best argument
against Chinese Immigration from the moral
standpoint.

arc frequently committed. In thirty years IMT,
Chinese felons have served time. During the
last six months 1140 arrests were made in
Chlnutcwn. It breeds murder, crime, licen
tiousneÃS, slavery.
Destroy It. Let the plow run through the
filthy streets. Plant corn where vice grows.
Let fountains splash where the opium fumes
lill the air. Open it as a playground for the
children. Remove the standing: menace to
health and happiness and air the most pow
erful arsumsnt against unrestricted Chinese
immigration.
Chinese immigration feeds the already active
wickedness of our country through at least
four well-known vices. They are prostiution,
gambling:, opium smoking and murder.
In conclusion, what shall we do about it?
We are here to memorialize Congress. Shall
we ask for a closed door of Chinese exclusion
or for a modified restriction measure?
We are united here In the West In believing
some sort of exclusion is imÂ»erative. and the
people of California are not In the temper to
take ar.y chances. We cannot open the dam
of Mongolian invasion.
We stand for American labor, which must
be irotected. We cannot offer up American
labor on the altar of international commerce,
which is not threatened In any event. Labor
must be protected and the moral life of the
public be defended. Some form of exclusion
is a national, a moral, an economic necessity.
We must recoitnizo and acknowledge the
friendly relations of the two countries and
make a recommendation in accordance with
International treaty procedure in terms humil
iating neither to China nor injurious to
America.
Since the Geary bill was passed a new posi
tion among the powers has been taken by our
nation. We have been fighting battles for
humanity. Let us act in accordance with the
spirit of these wars and in harmony with the
spirit which actuated them.
The -world is watching us. Let us act with
deliberationâ not as partisans, but as broad
minded patriots. The claÂ«s of coolies which
make up the rank and file of the California
population who come without wives or wealth,
who Interfere with American worklnjrmen on
the one hand and affect public morals on the
other, should have the door of the nation closed
tight asalnat them and locked with a Geary
key.
If there is any doubt as to the working of a
law with a qualification, let us give the pres
ent exclusion law the benefit of the doubt.
That the men of brains and culture in China,
the statesmanship recognized by General Grant
In LI Hung Chiang, whom he considered on;
of the three greatest statesmen of the world,
that the men who have adopted Eurouean or
American ideas and who are the moral lead
era of their race â students, teachers, merchants
â that these should be recognized and respected
by our declaration to Congress and by the law
Congress may enact is to say the least con
sistent with the higher spirit of the American
people and just to the higher life of Chlna.

would come up for solution. I tested the temper
of the Congressmen to find out whether or not
it was necessary when I returned to Congress
again to be prepared for a conflict, and I found
that I had to be ready for a fight with my col

We have expanded as a nation. There has
been a difference of opinion on the question
of expansion, but these differences of opinion
have been settled by the manifest destiny of
the American nation, and she expands, un
der God. whether you want It or not. (Ap
plause.) Expanded as she is in obedience to
the divine decree, are we now to mutilate
this expansion by allowing the doors of the
western portion of the continent to be opened
to 400,000,000 of Chinese who bring to America
nothing but degradation and despair? (Cries
of 'No, no! 'i You say no. That is our opin

that this country can never stand i* the com

ready to call this convention together at any

commercialism of the East, represented by
such men as Morgan, is against us and we
need help, that we can ask you, with the cry
from Macedonia, to come over and help us, let
him call this convention ! together again and
stay in session until we can say to the East,

citizens in session In California iÂ»nd they will
stay In session until this battle is won." (Great

MEMORIAL OF THE EXCLUSION CONVENTION
ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS
TO The President and the Congress of the United
States: Pursuant to a call officially issued by the
city of San Francisco, there assembled in that city
the 21st day of November, 1901, for the purpose
of expressing the sentiment? of the State of Cali
fornia, a convention composed of representatives
I f County Supervisor?. City Councils, trade, com
mercial and civic organizations to the number of
three thousand, and without dissent it was resolved to memorial
ize the President and the Congress of the United States as fol
lows:
after the negotiation of the Burlingrame treaty in 1868
large numbers of Chinese coolies were brought to this country
unUer contract Their numbers so increased that in 1878 the peo
ple of the State made a practically unanimous demand for the
lestrktion of the immigration. Our white population suffered in
every department of labor and trade, having in numerous in
stances been driven out of employment by the competition of the
â¢ 'hinese. The progress of the State was arrested because so long
he field was occupied by Chinese a new and desirable immi
gration was impossible. After a bitter struggle remedial legisla
tion was passed in ISS2 and was renewed in 1892, to
run for a period of te:: years. Your memorialists, in view of
the fact thai the present so-called Geary law expires by limita
tion or. May 5 next, and learning that you have been petitioned
against its re-er.actment. believe that it is necessary for them to
repeat and to reaffirm the reasons which, in their judgment, re
quire the re-enactment and the continued enforcement of the law.
The effects of Chinese exclusion have been most advantageous
to the State. The 75.000 Chinese resident of California in ISc-O
have been reduced, according- to the last census, to 45,600; and
whereas, ihe white settlement of California by Caucasians had
been arrested prior to the adoption of these laws, a healthy
growth of the State in population has marked the progress of re
cent years. Every material interest 'of the State has advanced
and prosperity has been our portion. Were the restriction laws
relaxed we are convinced that our working population would be
displaced, and the noble structure of our State, the creation of
American ideas and industry would be imperiled if not destroyed.
The lapse of time has only confirmed your memorialists in their
conviction, from their knowledge derived from actually coming in
contact with the Chinese, that they are a non-assimilative race
and by every standard of American thought undesirable as citi
zens. Although they have been frequently employed and treated
with decent consideration ever since the enactment of the exclu
sion law in ISS2. which was the culmination and satisfaction of
California's patriotic purpose, they have not in any sense altered
their racial characteristics and have not socially or otherwise as
similated with our people. To quote the Imperial Chinese Consul
General in San Francisco: "They work more cheaply than
whites; they live more cheaply; they send their money out of the
country to China; most of them have no intention of remaining
in the United States, and they do not adopt American manners,
but live in colonies and not after the American fashion."
Physical Assimilation Impossible.
Until this year no statute had been passed by the State for
bidding their intermarriage with the whites, and yet during their
Jong residence but few intermarriages have taken place and the
offspring; has been invariably degenerate. It is well established
that the issue of the Caucasian and the Mongolian does not pos
sess the virtue of either, but develops the vices of both. So phys
ical assimilation is out of the question.
It is well known that the vast majority of Chinese do not
bring their wives with them in their immigration because of their
v urpose to return to their native land when a competency is
earned. Their practical status among us has been that of single
men competing at low wages against not only men of our own
race, but men -who have been brought up by our civilization to
family life and civic duty. They pay little taxes, they support no
institutionsâ neither school, church nor theater; they remain

It is a well-known fact that the physical
characteristlC6 of the Chinaman prevent his
assimilation with our people. He must always
be foreign to us, ever, if in our midÂ«. Xot
only the laborers, but those Chinamen skilled
in torn* art or trade in their peculiar way in
ter'ere with the industries of our country. The
Chinaman is content to live in narrow quar
ter*, unfit in an American's eye for the hab
itation of a horse or a dog. He is content and
a to work for the bare sustenance of
his brute-like life. All of these things enable
work for a pittance compared with the
pay of the American laborer, who properly

to procure for hi 6 children an education.
I say, gentlemen of this convention, that wÂ»
must prevent the degradation of the American
workingman. < Applause ) He Is the bulwark
sperity, and, to use an old and well
known saying, his dinner pall must not be
emptied by allowing Chinamen to enter into
competition -with him. rÃenewed applause.)
In conclusion I say none, no not one in the
least of degrees can b<> excueed from doing his
duty by the American people and by the people

American soil.
To learn this may astonish many, bnt It Is a fact neverthe

He Says They Are in Sympathy With

J. S. Taylor of Napa, past lecturer of
the State Grange, followed with an ad

nia. He said:
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Chinese
Exclusion Conventionâ l have been requested
to addreES you as a representative of the farm
ing Interests of this State as to what effect
the free and unlimited immigration of Chinese
would have on our fanners and have chosen
for my subject "The Chinese Coolie and the
American Farmer."
Gentlemen, where in the world will you find a
greater contrast than that between these slaves
of the Orient and the free and independent farm
ers of America? The coolie is. to all intents and
purposes, a slave. He Is owned, both body and
soul, by that powerful corporation, the great
trust of China, known here as the Chinese Six
Companies. His fare is paid to this country and,
if he has any difficulty in getting in, this pow
erful combination has the means to employ
the brightest legal talent that we have, which
will, sometimes. I am sorry to say. prostitute

our laws for the filthy lucre of the "heathen

paid until he finds work; he may be sent into
the country and hire out as a farm hand or as
orchard help. Then he slaves for years in or
der to re-pay his masters, and, if he should die
here, to have his precious bones sent back
to the Flowery Kingdom. John is very imita
tive and s'X>n learns to run a farm or an or

American citizens of this grand and gloruus
republic, think twice before you let down the
bars of reetriction against this, to us, most
alien of all human races.
Pome of our mirgulded statesmen and avari

being of our laboring and farming classes for
an extension of our trade with the Chinese
Empire; they dr> not act upon the principle of

but their motto is "the greatest good to th^
least number." For this paltry foreign trade
they would destroy the- greatest market in the
world, cur own home market. What makes this

steadfastly, after all these years, a permanently foreign element.
The purpose, no doubt, for enacting the exclusion laws for periods
of ten years is due to the intention of Congress of observing the
progress of these people under American institutions, and now
it has been clearly demonstrated that they cannot, for the
deep and ineradicable reasons of race and mental organization,
assimilate with our own people and be molded as are other races
into strong and composite American stock.
We respectfully represent that their presence excludes a de
sirab!e population and that there is no necessity whatever for
their immigration. The immigration laws of this country now
exclude pauper and contract labor from every land. All Chinese
immigration of the coolie class is both pauper and contract labor.
It is not a voluntary immigration. The Chinese Six Companies
of California deal in Chinese labor as a commodity. Prior to the
exclusion they freely imported coolies, provided for them, farmed
out their services and returned them, and if they should die their
bones, pursuant to a superstitious belief, to their native land.
America is the asylum for the oppressed and liberty-loving
people of the world, and the implied condition of their admission
to this country is allegiance to its Government and devotion to its
institutions. It is hardly necessary to say that the Chinese are
not even bona fide settlers, as the Imperial Chinese Consul Gen
eral admits.
We respectfully represent that American labor should not be
exposed to the destructive competition of aliens who do not, will
not and cannot take up the burdens of American citizenship,
whose presence is an economic blight and a patriotic danger. It
has been urged that the Chinese are unskilled and that they create
wealth in fiel.l, mine and forest, which ultimately redounds to the
benefit of the white skilled workingman. The Chinese are skilled
and are capable of almost any skilled employment. They have
invaded the cigar, shoe, broom, chemical, clothing, fruit canning,
matchmaking and woollen manufacturing industries, and have
displaced more than 4000 white men in these several employments
in the city of San Francisco. As common laborers they have
throughout California displaced tens of thousands of men. But
this country is not solely concerned even in a coldly economic
sense with the production of wealth.
Grave Danger of Overproduction.
The United States has now a greater per capita of working
energy than any other land. If it is stimulated by a non-assim
ilative and non-consuming race there is grave danger of overpro
duction and stagnation. The home market should grow with the
population. But the Chinese, living on the most meager food,
having no families to support, inured to deprivation, and hoard
ing their wages for use in their native land, whither they in% rari
ably return, cannot in any sense be regarded as consumers. Their
earnings do not circulate nor are they reinvested â contrary to
those economic laws which make for the prosperity of nations.
For their services they may be said to be paid twice â first by their
employer and then by the community. If we must have protec
tion, is it not far better for us to protect ourselves against the
man than against his trade? Our opponents maintain that the
admission of the Chinese would cause an enlargement of out
national wealth and a great increase of production, but the dis
tribution of wealth and not its production is to-day our most
serious public question. In this age of science and invention the
production of wealth can well be left to take care of itself. It is
its equitable distribution that must now be the concern of the
country.
The increasing recurrence of strikes in modern times must
have convinced every one that their recent settlement is nothing
more than a truce. It is not a permanent industrial peace. The
new organization of capital and labor that is now necessary to
bring about lasting peace and harmony between those engaged in
production will require greater sympathy, greater trust and con
fidence and a clearer mutual understanding between the employ
ers and the employed. Any such new organization will require a
closer union to be formed between them. These requirements can

TELLS OP UNSANITARY
STATE OF CHINATOWN
Dr. Williamson of the Board of
Health Reads an Interesting
Paper to Delegates.
Supervisor Charles Wesley Reed sug
gested that the Rev. Peter C. Yorke be
invited to address the convention. The
suggestion was greeted with applause and
Mr. Reed was appointed a committee to
bring the clergyman to the convention
Dr. Williamson, of the San Francisco
Board of Health then read the following
paper:
In presenting views upon the subject assigned
by the committee of arrangements, the writer
feels it incumbent upon himself as a represen
tative of the municipal government, to limit
his remarks as closely as possible to the in
fluences exerted by the Chinese upon the gen
eral health of this community. At the saxno
time an attempt will be made to show in what
principal respects the race in question is an
undesirable element, especially when colonized
in cities and towns. Industrial or social con
ditions will not be considered, as these feat
ures can be more thoroughly dealt with by
those whose study and research of the prob
lems involved have qualified them to discuss
the subject with both intelligence and under
standing.
What may be said concerning the Chinese of
San Francisco will apply with almost an
equivalent amount of force to any community
upon the Pacific Coast in which people of the
Chinese race may be found, and it can be ac
cepted by those interested as one of the con
tributing factors to the many reasons which
justify and even demand the re-enactment of
the exclusion act.
Taking the habits and customs of the Chintse
of San Francisco as typical of those exhibited
by them when grouped in any American com
munity, it can be alleged without danger uf
contradiction that the section of the city in
habited by them has given more concern to the
never be fulfilled between the Individuals of races so alien to one
another as ourselves and the Chinese.
The Chinese are only capable of working under the present
unsatisfactory system. All progress then to an improved organ
ization of capital and labor would be arrested. We might have
greater growth, but never greater development. It was estimated
by the Commissioner of Labor that there were a million idle men
in the United States in 1886. Certainly the 76,000 Chinese in Cali
fornia at that time stood for 76,000 white men waiting for employ
ment, and the further influx of Chinese in any considerable num
bers would precipitate the same condition again, if not indeed
make it chronic. If the United States increases in population at
the rate of 12 per cent per decade it will have nearly 230,000,000
people in 100 years. Our inventive genius and the constant im
provements being made in machinery will greatly increase our
per capita productive capacity. If it be our only aim to increase
our wealth so as to hold our own in the markets of the world are
we not, without the aid of Chinese coolies, capable of doing it and
at the same time preserve the character of our population and
insure the perpetuity of our institution? It is not wealth at any
cost that sound public policy requires, but that the country be
developed with equal pace and with a desirable population which
stands not only for industry but for citizenship.
Chinese Crowding Out Americans.
In their appeal to the cupidity of farmers and orchardists tha
proponents of Chinese immigration have stated that the Chinese
are only common laborers, and by this kind of argument they
have attempted to disarm the skilled labor organizations of the
country; but we have shown you that the Chinese are skilled and
are capable of becoming skilled. As agriculturists they have
crowded out the native population and driven the country boy
from the farm to the city, where he meets their skilled competition
in many branches of industry. But shall husbandry be abandoned
to a servile class? Shall the boys and girls of the fields and of the
orchards be deprived of their legitimate work in the harvest .'
Shall not our farmers be encouraged to look to their own house
holds and to their own neighbors for labor? Shall the easy meth
ods of contract employment be encouraged? We are warned by
history that the free population of Rome was driven by slave
labor from the country into the city, where it became a mob
and a rabble, ultimately compassing the downfall of the republic.
The small farms were destroyed, and under an overseer large
farms were cultivated, which led Pliny to remark that "great
estates ruined Italy."
The experience of the South with slave labor warns us
against unlimited Chinese immigration, considered both as a race
question and as an economic problem. The Chinese, if permitted
to freely enter this country, would create race antagonisms which
would ultimately result in great public disturbance. The Cau
casian will not tolerate the Mongolian. As ultimately all gov
ernment is based on physical force, the white population of this
country will not without resistance suffer itself to be destroyed.
Economically it was thought wise at one time to employ negro
slaves, but the accumulated wealth of the South was wiped out by
an appalling expenditure of blood and money, precipitating condi
tions which bore with terrible force upon a people which were once
considered great and prosperous. The cornerstone of their struc
ture was slavery, and the cornerstone of any structure based upon
the employment of Chinese coolies is servile labor. It is repugnant
to our form of society and to our ideas of government to segre
gate a labor class and regard it only as its capacity for work. If
we were to return to the ante-bellum ideas of the South, now hap
pily discarded, the Chinese would satisfy every requirement of a
slave or servile class. They work incessantly, they are docile
and they would not be concerned about their political conditions,
but such suggestions are repulsive to American civilization.
America has dignified work and made it honorable. Manhood
gives title to rights, and the Government being ruled by majori
ties is largely controlled by the very class which servile labor

bined. Violations of sanitary laws and inde
cencies of many descriptions are no sooner
suppressed or abated than they are almost in
variably repeated. The Chinese, exclusive of
the ofheial and mercantile classes, appear to
revel in dirt and wallow In filth in prefer
ence to becoming and remaining clean, even
when the cleanliness is provided and paid
for by the landlord, the city or the State.
During the past five years the holders of
real estate In San Francisco's Chinatown have
been compelled to spend many thousands? of
dollars for sanitary plumbing to replace that
of antique anil inefficient character which has
been condemned to the health officials. It
is an acknowledged fact that unless a strict
daily watch is maintained some of the oc
cupants of the premises wheie improved
plumbing has been placed will fexhibit their
disapproval of such innovation by willfully
breaking and damaging the same.
Property owners In Chinatown, who would
otherwise be perfectly willing to follow the di
lections of the Board of Health, have often
complained against being forced to put forth
large expenditures for modern plumbing,
claiming that as soon as it is installed it will
be ruined beyond repair.
In the Chinese quarter of San Francisco open
rewers have been found running through
underground living apartments. After these
have been closed by the authorities they have
been repeatedly reopened by the persons living
in the premises, who seem to regard an open
sewer as a convenience instead of a nuisance.
In the subterranean strata there are places
where tunnels have been dug leading from in
habited basements beneath the street as far
as the main sewer, which has been opened in
trder to afford ready access, for what par
ticular purpose the Chinese alone can say.
On one tour of inspection tiers of bunks occu
pied by sleeping Chinese were found In a
tunnel Just on the verge of an open sewer.
The utter contempt for the simplest princi
ples of sanitation has resulted in the deliberate
breaking or obstructing of drain pipes which
unless discovered by inspectors have been
permitted fo discharge their output into cel
lars and other excavations, where it saturates
the soil and continually gives forth offensive
exhalations.
Opium smoking, once a purely Oriental vice,
has received so much attention In the past
that little reference Is necessary, except It be
to point with disgust and chagrin to the read
iness with which the habit has been adopted
by a considerable number of whites who after
reaching their appropriate level of degradation
find In the crowded and unhealthy purlieus of
Chinatown a haven of uncleanliness admirably
adapted to their debased instincts.
Police vigilance has minimized to a great
extent the prostitution in the quarter which
served as a notorious distributing center for
venereal diseases and It Is not long since the
district was cleared of many white girls who
plied this calling among the Chinese exclu
sively.
As a result of poorly ventilated and over
crowded apartments, the utter disregard of
ordinary principles of cleanliness and the uni
versal infatuation for dirt, disease Is active.
In the fiscal year ending June 30. 1899, 548
deaths occurred among the Chinese. Estimat
ing the population at 13,000. this number gives
a death rate of 30.44 per thousand; the city's
death rate was 19.72 per thousand. In the
following year 562 deaths were credited to the
Chinese, or 31.22 per thousand; the city's death
rate was 18.81 per thousand. During the last
fiscal year 418 deaths were reported, or 23.22
per thousand, while the city's rate was 19.48
per thousand. These figures show the death
rate among these people to be vastly In ex
cess of the general death rate in the city of
San Francisco. The diminution during the last
fiscal year Is due without question to the fact
that many sick Chinese left the city during
the quarantine excitement and their deafhe
took place at different points of the Interior.

SANITARY LAWS VIOLATED.
TAKING tbe habits and cnntomi of the Chinese of San Fran
cisco as typical of those exhibited by them when gjronped
in an American community, it can be alleged -without dan
ger of contradiction that the section of the city inhabited
by them has jrlven more concern to the authorities than all the
rest of the city combined. Violations of sanitary laws and inde
cencies of many descriptions are no sooner suppressed or abated
than they are almost invariably repeated. The Chinese, exclusive
of the official and mercantile classes, appear to revel in dirt and

for the people of California to meet In conven
tion to declare their sentiments upon the ques
tion of the exclusion of Chinese coolie labor
from our shores, because the sentiment in this
State, without regard to creed, class or po
litical affiliation, is almost unanimous upon
the subject, and that unanimity declares in
no uncertain tones the desire for continued ex
clusion. It is because of the misleading reports
which have been sent abroad, however, in re
gard to the feeling upon the question In Cali
fornia that It is necessary that some form of
public expression should be given by the peo
ple of the State, and for that reason the call
ing of this convention is to be highly com
mended.
The desirability of white help as compared
to Chinese, both to the Individual and the State,
is greatly in favor of the former in all re
spects. It Is a fact not to be denied nor con
troverted that no other class of labor can exist
on the same amount and class of food and
with as little expenditure of money as the
Chinese. They have no family ties and do not
and cannot and, for that matter, care not to
affiliate with our society or with our institu
tions. They come here not to stay but to
accumulate money to return home. They bring
the bulk of their food, which is rice, and their
wearing apparel with them. They eend the
bulk of their earnings out of the country. I
believe that I am understating rather than
overstating the fact when I say that 90 per
cent of the money paid to the Chinese laborer
Is exported from the country.
PRESSMEN PASS SOME
STRONG RESOLUTIONS
G. M. Benham Presents Them to the
Members of the Exclusion
Convention.
G. B. Benham, representing the Print
ing Pressmen's Association, delivered a
stirring speech and read the following
resolutions which were adopted by tho
Printing Pressmen's Union No. 24:
Whereas, The constant and menacing Influx
of Chinese into the United States Is essentially
detrimental to the Interests of the entire work
ing class, and especially to the organized work
ers of the Pacific Coast.
Every trade and occupation Is Indirectly inter
fered with by the Chinese, and many trades
(notably the shoe workers and the cigarmakers)
have been irretrievably injured by Chinese com
petition; and
Whereas, After Investigation by a committee
from the Printing Pressmen's Union No. 24 of
San Francisco seven Chinese printing offices
are found In San Francisco, and others are
known to exist In other coast cities. These
offices are all doing English printing, are exe
cuting all label printing and cigar-box print-
Ing for the Chinese cigar trade and for some
white manufacturers, and are also doing litho
graphing, lowering the price of all, and are
rapidly making inroads in other specialties in
the printing trade, thus directly endangering
would supersede, namely, the free and independent workingmen
of America. The political power invested in men by this Govern
ment shows the absolute necessity of keeping up the standard of
population and not permitting it to deteriorate by contact with
inferior and non-assimilative races.
Question Involves Our Civilization.
But this is not alone a race, labor and political question. Ii
is one which involves our civilization, and that interests the peo
ple of the world. The benefactors, scholars, soldiers and states
men â the patriots and martyrs of mankind â have builded our
modern fabric firmly upon the foundation of religion, law, science
and art. It has been rescued from barbarism and protected
against the incursions of barbarians. Civilization in Europe has
been frequently attacked and imperiled by the barbaric hordes of
Asia. If the little band of Greeks at Marathon had not beaten
back ten times their number of Asiatic invaders it is impossible to
estimate the loss to civilization that would have ensued. When
we contemplate what modern civilization owes to the two cen
turies of Athenian life, from which we first learned our lessons of
civil and intellectual freedom, we can see how necessary it was
to keep the Asiatic from breaking into Europe. Attila and his
Asiatic hordes threatened Central Europe when the Gauls made
their successful stand against them. The wave of Asiatic bar
barism rolled back and civilization was again saved. The repulse
of the Turks, who are â¢of the Mongolian race, before Vienna
finally made our civilization strong enough to take care of itself,
and the danger of extinction by a military invasion from Asia
passed away. But a peaceful invasion is more dangerous than a
warlike attack. We oan meet and defend ourselves against an
open foe, but an insidious foe ander our generous laws would be
in possession of the citadel before we are aware. The free immi
gration of Chinese would be for all purposes an invasion by
Asiatic barbarians, against whom civilization in Europe has been
frequently defended fortunately for us. It is our inheritance to
keep it pure and uncontaminated. as it is our purpose and destiny
to broaden and enlarge it. We are trustees for mankind.
In an age when the brotherhood of man has become more
fully recognized we are not prepared to overlook the welfare of the
Chinaman, himself. We need have nothing on our national con
science because the Chinaman has a great industrial desttny in
his own country. Few realize that China is yet a sparsely popu
lated country- Let their merchants, travelers and students then
come here as before to carry back to China the benefits of our
improvements and experiments. Let American ideas of progress
and enterprise be planted on Chinese soil. Our commerce with
China since ISBO has increased more than 50 per cent. Our consu
lar service reports that "the United States is second only to Great
Britain in goods sold to the Chinese. The United States buys
more goods from China than does any other nation, and her total
trade with China, exports and imports, equals that of Great
Britain, not including the colonies, and is far ahead of that oi
any other country."
Commerce is not sentimental and has not been affected by our
policy of exclusion. The Chinese Government, knowing the neces
sities of the situation, being familiar with the fact that almost
every country has imposed restrictions upon the immigration of
Chinese coolies, does not regard our attitude as an unfriendly act.
Indeed, our legislation has been confirmed by treaty. Nor are the
Chinese unappreciative of the friendship of the United States re
cently displayed in saving possibly the empire itself from dis
memberment. So, therefore, America is at no disadvantage in its
commercial dealings with China on account of the domestic policy
of Chinese exclusion.
Therefore every consideration of public duty, the nation's
safety and the people's rights, the preservation of our civilization
and the perpetuity of our institutions impel your memorialists to
ask for the re-enactment of the exclusion laws which have for
twenty years protected us against the gravest dangers, and which,
were they relaxed, would imperil every interest which the Ameri
can people hold sacred for themselves and their posterity.
our means of livelihood and (as In every other
occupation entered by the Chinese) assisting in
the general lowering of the standard of living
of the American workers. Tne committee finds
these conditions largely due to the instruction
in the printing trade given by the Christian
missionaries to their Chinese converts, and
the apparent laxness In the enforcing of the
now existing laws against Chinese emigration.
In view of these facts, and the deplorable
moral and material results to be seen from the
presence of Chinese in our midst, be it
Resolved. By the Printing Pressmen's Union
No. 34 of San Francisco, as a measure of pro
tection for its members in their occupation,
and in the interest of all organized workers,
that we demand tho enactment of a law posi
tive in its restrictions against Chinese and all
Asiatics; that the exclusion law known as the
Geary act be rigidly enforced until its expira
tion; that In furtherance of our desires we
pledge our moral, financial and political support
to such candidates and political parties as sig
nify their desires to stop the further inroads of
the Chinese upon American soli, and In this we
ask the support of all who wish to defend the
Interests of the American producers: that we
will oppose by every means at our command
any candidate for public office, any political
party and all legislative or executive action
favorable to the continuance of the Chinese
Invasion, an emigration ruinous to the morals
of the people, detrimental to American pro
ducers and dangerous to the lives and happi
ness of tee American workers.

J. C. Millan spoke in behalf of the
Cigar-makers' Union.
Senator John F. Davis of Amador pre
sented the report of the committee on
memorials and resolutions. It was re

the memorial and the resolutions be
signed by the officers of the convention,
be forwarded to the President, members
of the Cabinet, members of Congress and
California's Representatives in Congress.
In seconding the motion VT. Macarthur
spoke as follows:

to make room for the pauper labor of Souther-
Europe cr other sections of the world.. In re
gard to the commercial interests, which has
been urged as an argument against exclusion,
the position of organized labor is that we are
willing to lose every dollar of our trade with
China to preserve our citizenship and the Ideals
of American life. If to preserve that trade we

people within the domain of the I'nltsd

Senator Davis then introduced the fol

YUKON PLOT
IS REPORTED
OFFICIALLY
Dominion Government
Makes Public Its
Telegrams.
Investigation of the Conspir
acy Is Carried On for
Weeks.
Superintendent of Mounted Police
TellE in Dispatch of the Appeal
Made to United States
Officials.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
VANCOUVER, B. C. Nov. 22.â The first
official announcement of the Yukon con
spiracy was made to-day. It was given
out at the Department of the Interior in
Ottawa that since late in September the
Dominion Government has had cognizance
of the plot and was carrying on a vigor
ous investigation. The American officials
in Alaska nad been appealed to. tout had
insisted that tangible proof of tne opera
tions of the conspirators be supplied be
fore they would take action. Tne follow
ing telegram from Superintendent Woods
in Dawson, received by Comptroller Fred
Whyte on November 4. shows now serious
the situation had become:
"Sr.yder reports discovered whereabouts
In Skagway of papers relating to con
spiracy to seize territory. United States
refuse to secure unless Snyder makes aiÃ
fiavits as to conspirators. This, of course,
Jie cannot. Am satisfied such conspiracy
exists."
Previous to the receipt of this telegram
the Ottawa officials had not regarded the
plot as being so extensive as lateV de
velopments proved. They believed -that
only a handful of disgruntled adventurer?
were involved. Since that date, however,
the* wires between Ottawa and Dawson
have been kept busy.
Warning Given in September.
The first news of the conspiracy reached
Ottawa on September Zl last, when Comp
troller Whyte of the Interior Department
was advised by Superintendent Primrose
of the mounted police in Dawson of a re
port from Seattle that some scheme was
being concocted to seize Canadian terri
tory or. the Yukon. On September 25 Mr:
Whyte again received a message from
Superintendent Primrose saying that he
was unable to confirm the report, al
though it was serious. On September 27
Superintendent Primrose wired that his
previous cipher message referred to the
disputed territory on the Dalton trail, and
that he was sending a mail report.
The promised letter from Superintendent
Primrose arrived on October' 7. Primrose
gave the results of the partial investiga
tion he had made.
It appears that a man named H. Greh!
had told another man In Dawson that he
knew of a conspiracy against the Govern
ment. Grehl had been shadowed by the
police and it was discovered that he had
told several stories about himself: that
he had been in Dawson about a month;
that his conversation was to the effect
that he belonged to a secret organization
which intended to take possession of the
Yukon Territory, its plan being to capture
White Horse and the smaller detachments
of mounted police along the river, when
It would be an easy matter to capture the
barracks in Dawson. He said the organi
zation had representatives in both Seattle
and Skagway and that it expected to be
assisted by men from Circle City and
Eagle City.
Grehl was known by a member of the
mounted police as having been in the gro
cery business in Butte. Mont.
Nothing more was heard of the plot
until November 4. when Comptroller Fred
Whyte received the telegram from Super
intendent Woods in Dawson. declaring
that there was a conspiracy of great di
mensions to seize Canadian territory.
Facts Known in Ottawa.
OTTAWA. Nov. 22.â The story of the
Yukon plot, based upon official reports to
the Minister of the Interior, follows:
"About three weeks ago the police at
Dawson. under the direction of Superin
tendent Woods, shadowed a man whom
they believed to be a suspicious character.
The police got into this man's confidence
end he finally disclosed a plot which he
said had been formed by people in Skag
usy and Seattle. The idea was to rush
the posts in the lower part of the Yukon
and then take possession of the country.
The conspirators reckoned upon the
American citizens in the Yukon not as
sisting the Canadian authorities, so that
the raid, in their opinion, would be com
paratively an easy matter.
"News of the plot was quickly sent
from Dawson to White Horse, and the
police there soon had under surveillance
all suspicious persons. The headquarters
of the conspiracy was located in Skaguay
and it was ascertained who the men asso
ciated with it were and where the papers
bearing upon the plot were kept. There
was nothing, however, to show any overt
set of treason to the United States or
Canada: consequently the authorities
could not take any proceedings. Canadian
officers went down to Skaguay. neverthe
less, and consulted with United States
officers, and concerted action was agreed
upon in case of necessity. In the mean
time the persons connected with the plot
are closely watched."

MRS. BONINE DISPLAYS EMOTION
WHEN BLOOD-STAINED SHIRT IS SHOWN
Washington Police Relate Grcumstances of the Mysterious Murder of
James Seymour Ayers Jr* at Kenmore HoteL
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â Five
â¢witnesses were heard to-day
in the trial of Mrs. Ida Bo
nine for the murder of James
S. Ayers Jr. Four of these
witnesses were policemen who had gone
to Ayers' room after discovery of the
body by employes of the Kenmore Hotel,
and the fifth was W. W. Warfield, who
was proprietor of the hotel at the time
of the tragedy. The policemen testified
to details of the wounds, position of the
body and arrangement of the furniture
in the room. Mr. Warfleld's testimony
was very brief. In response to a question
by Attorney Fulton of Mrs. Bonine's
counsel he said that Mrs. Bonine had
made arrangements to leave the hotel be
fore the tragedy occurred, but both the
question and answer were subsequently
ruled out. It is the intention of the de-

fense to call Warfield for the purpose of
eliciting information from him on this and
other points in Mrs. Bonine's behalf.
Only once during the day did Mrs. Bo
rine display emotion, and 'that was when
the bloody undershirt which had been
worn by Ayers on the night of the kill
ing was identified by Officer Brady.
Mrs. Bonine's party was augmented to
day by the addition of her brother. I*. S.
Grant Henry, -who had come from his
home in Mispouri in order to be present
with his sister during the trial. Mrs.
Bonine's two young son? also were pres
ent, as were her husband and her sister.
Mrs. Meacham.
Tells of the Tragedy.
Policeman Walter S. Brady was thp first
witness called. He was on duty near the
Kenmore Hotel on the morning that Ay
ers' body was discovered and was sum
moned to the hotel by the proprietor. W.
W. Warfield. He had. under Warfield's
instructions, forced open the door of Ay
ers' room. The door was bolted, and not
locked. The witness described the condi
tion of the room and of the body. Three
wounds were fov.nd upon the body, one
being in the breast, another in the arm
and a third in the thigh.
The bed looked. Brady said, as if some
one had lain in it and had got up,
throwing the cover back. There was only
one Indentation In the pillow. The wit
nfss said that a pistol and a small single
barreled shotgun lay on a trunk in the
room and that the barrel and the cham
bers of the pistol were covered with blood.
The pistol was exhibited to Brady and
identified by him.
There was a pool of blood, the witness
said, on the floor. Blood stains were also
on the window sill and baseboard and
on the rocker. On a table in the room
there were nine cartridges lying loose.
The gas was burning when he entered
the room, but was turned low. The lower
sash of the one window in the room was
up as far as it could go. The strlne on
the window shade was covered with blood
as if it had been drawn through bloody
fingers.
Garment Stained With Blood
in concluding his examination in chief
of the witness District Attorney Gould
put in evidence the undershirt found on
the body of Ayers. It was well stained
with blood. The sight of the garment ap
parently affected the prisoner more than
any preceding incident in the course of
the trial.
On cross-examination Officer Brady said
a boy had first notified him of the tragedy.
Mrs. Bonine's oldest Fon was told to
stand up and Lawyer Douglass asked the
witness if he was the messenger. The
witness failed to identify him. H* had
r.ot noticed any finger prints on the pistol
he found in the room. The blood on the
handle was unappreciable in quantity. Ho
had, however, discovered what he Re
lieved to be finger-prints on the window
sill. The detached piece of the window
sill was exhibited and identified by the
witness, who said the blood stains were
more distinct on the morning of May 15
than now.
Brady said in reply to other questions
by Douglass that the loose pistol car
tridges found on the table were of 38
caliber. the same as those found in the
revolver. In that weapon there were three
loads and three empty shells. He said
the bed as shown in the photographs of
Ayers' room was much more disordered
than when he first went to the room, but
he did not know who had disturbed it be
fore the photograph was made. Douglass
brought out the fact that the top button
hole of Ay|rs' undershirt was torn out.
Shot at Close Range.
Brady was excused and Policeman Ful
ton Wolfe was called. He had entered
the building with Officer Brady. His
testimony covered much the same ground
as that of the preceding witness and was
largely corroborative of it.
The pictures of the room, he said,
showed a number of articles on the floor
which were not there at the time. He
had seen no hairpins on the floor.
Policeman Williams was called. He
corroborated the statements of his
brother officers. He also said that blood
stains on the pistol Indicated that it had
been grasped around the chambers by a
bloody hand.
The witness said he had discovered no
evidence of any struggle. He made a
reply in the negative, as Officers Brady
and Wolfe had done, when asked if he
had discovered any hairpins on the floor.
On cross-examination he said he had
noticed the torn condition of the upper
buttonhole of Ayres' shirt and he added
that the corresponding button was hang
ing by a thread. There were also powder
marks about the wounds on Ayres' body,
indicating that he was shot at close
range.
The next witness was W. W. Warfield.
who was the proprietor of the Kenmore
Hotel when the homicide occurred there.
He said that Ayres occupied room 20 in
the main building, and Mrs. Bonine and
her family roomed in 69 and 70 in the an
nex, but on the same floor.
The court adjourned until Monday to
give the attorneys in the case an oppor
tunity to prepare themselves for the
work in hand.
HORROR COMES
AFTER DISASTER
Eight Mine Inspectors
Are Lost in a Gas
Filled Shaft.
BLUEFIELDS. W. Va., Nov. 22.-At 11
o'clock this morning Superintendent Wai
ter O'Molley of the Pocahontas Collieries
Company, along with State Mine Inspec
tor William Priest, A. S. Hurst, chief coal
inspector for the Castnor, Curran and
Bullet Company of Philadelphia; Robert
St. Clair. chief coal inspector; Morris St.
Clair and William Oldham, sub-coal in
spectors; Frazier G. Bell, mining engi
neer; Joseph Vardwell, manager of the
Shamokin Coal and Coke Company of
Maybury, W. Va., composing a party of
eight, entered the West mine of the South
west Virginia Improvement Company's
collieries for the purpose of learning the
true situation in regard to the recent ex
plosion and fire in the Baby mine and
up to this hour, 12 o'clock midnight have
not been heard from.
It was supposed that the Baby property
had been cut off from the West mine for
the purpose of operating the West mine.
The large fan in the West mine had been
started at an early hour this morning and
at 11 o'clock to-day it was thought that
all gases originating from the fire In the
Baby mine had been forced from the main
portion and it was considered safe to
enter.
At 6 a. m. a party consisting of expe
rienced miners, led by Assistant Superin
tendent King, entered the mine to rescue
the lost party of eight, but at 6:45 they
returned, having encountered such a
quantity of blackrlamp as to make tt im
possible to proceed any distance into the
mine. Assistant Superintendent King was
completely overcome by the gas encoun
tered and is now in a critical condition.
A consultation is now being held In the
company's offices at Pocahontas by the
different mining experts from the Flat
Top fields, these experts having been
rushed to Pocahontas by a special train
late this afternoon. All efforts are being
used to recover the bodies of the inspir
ing party, but no hope is entertained that
any of them will be recovered alive. The
secretary and treasurer of the South
western Virginia Improvement Company
C. S. Thorne of Philadelphia, is directlY
in charge of all movements at the mints!
The fire that originally started in the
Baby mine last Thursday morning and
which was supposed to have been under
control, is now burning fiercely. All the
members of the lost party are prominent
in the coal field and the excitement now
prevailing at Pocahontas is Intense, busi
ness having been practically suspended
All members of the party are married
some having large families.

Second Upheaval in Six

PITTSBURG, Nov. 22.â For the second
time within six months the city govern
ment of Pittsburg is about to undergo an
entire change.
Major A. M. Brown, appointed City Re
corder last April by Governor Stone, has
been requested to step down and out by
the chief executive of the State and J. O.
Brown, Director of Public Safety under
the old regime, will assume the duties of
the office. The change in the Recorder's
office will be followed by the restoration
to their old places of the one hundred or
more city officials recently removed by
Major Brown.
The upheaval is the result of a fight
for control of the city government which
has been going on for nearly a. year be
tween the "Stalwart" Republicans and
the old Republican organization under
the leadership of State Senator William
The letter of dismissal from the Gov
ernor was received by Major Brown last
night, and in the same mall came the
notice to former Director J. O. Brown of
his appointment. The new Recorder's
commission has not yet arrived and he
will hardly take the oath of office before
next Monday, as he cannot qualify until
after the approval of his bond by the
Governor. In the meantime the city will
likely be left without an executive head,
for the reason that the Governor's notice
of removal was effective upon receipt of
it by Major Brown.

VICTORIA, B. C. Nov. 22.â The Juneau
Dispatch of November 14 reports that the
steamer Yukon arrived there, bringing
word that Hoonah Indians came aboard
the vessel in Glacier Bay and said they
had seen the wreck of a schooner, with
a boy's jacket, a messbox and a jack

SEATTLE, Nov. 22.â The long overdue
steamer Elmore, thirty-five days out* from
Nome, will reach port within the next
few Jays. She is reported as having been
spoken by the steamer Discovery on No

to November 11 the Discovery had been
wintlbound at Kyak. A fierce storm was
raging, but apparently the Elmore weath

Some speculation is growing regarding
the non-appearance of the schooner John
A. Long, also from Nome. None of the

On October 5 the schooner was entering
that port in distress, short of provisions
and water. The vessel had ninety fcaa
sengers aboard, and while no grave fears
are entertained for her safety it is be

encountered since leaving Dutch Harbor

Interesting Friday-Night Addrassas

"The oppressor is a criminal." said
Kabbi Voorsanger at the Temple Emanu-
El last night. In part he said:
The etmplest elernerts In social life exist
Â¦vrijerp men congregate- m the same plane, but
in lircs congregating they sacrifice some of
their personal liberty. The ba>is of common
action, not Individual action, rests on sacri
fice. ICatlcnal Interest commands a common
Interest. Let the -word of God or the word o?
the fclr.ir Ftand for what it may, both stand
for authority. Perfect liberty belongs only to
the savage, to the [dUui who roams the
plates.; Civilized man surrenders that which
makes perfect liberty in order to better the so
cial conditions of the world.
If freedom of speech Â¦were used properly it
vrouU be the greatest of all benefactors. Free
coir. of speech too often becomes the passion of
fpeeeh. To caricature in my opinion Is a
crime.
"Reasonableness of Liberal Attitude
Toward Other Faith?" was the subject of
Rabbi Xieto's address last evening. He
f.'iid (1 was not right tc denounce other
faiths based solely on historical facts. In

When faith Is stripped from the super

THE RIGHT THINGS
A New Catarrh Cure, Which Is
Rapidly Coming to the F-ont.
For several years. Eucalyptol Gualcol
BTid Hydra stin have been recognized as
standard r'-m^ies for catarrhaJ troubles,
bur they have always been given sepa-
lately and only very recently an ingenious
st succeeded in combining them, to-
t v.ith other antiseptics, into a
:ect;ve tablet.
Dj-uj . the remedy under the
i.ame of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and it
remarkable success In the
<-ure of nasal catarrh, bronchial and
. : : and in catarrh of the
= eh.
Mr. F. N. Benton, whose address is care
of Clark House. Troy. X. V., says: "When
I run up against anything that is good I
like to t<r!l people of it. I have been
.I'd with ca.-irrh more or less for
time. Last winter more than ever.
Tried several eo-ca led cures, but did not
get any benefit from them. About .-ix
c ago I bought a 60 cent bex of Stu-
> atarrh Tablets- and am glad to say
hry have done wonders for me and
I do not hesitate to et all my friends
know that Stuart's C itarrh Tablets are
cht thing."
Mr. Geo. J. Casanove of Hotel Griffon,
West 9th Ftreet, New York City, writes:
"I have commenced uMng Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and alrtady they have
given me better result* Than any catarra
r jre I have ever tried."
A leading physician of Pittsburg advises
the use of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in
preference to any other treatment for
catarrh of the head, throat or stomach.
He claims they are far superior to ln-
>, salvee, lotione or powder, and are
much more convenient and pleasant to
take and are so harmless that little chil-
â¢Â£_ke them with benefit, as they con-
:-o opiate, cocaine or any poisonous
drugs.
An druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
letr at 50 cents for full size package and
tey are probably the safest and moÃt
reliable cure for any form of catarrh. '

HANDSOMEST VESSEL EH PORT.
That Is What People Say About the
Lady Wentworth.
The British four-n -i-Ftc-d bark Lady
Wentworth, now lying at Lombard-street
wharf, is called by people aior.g the front
"the handsomest vessel in port." She
certainly is a beaatifu! ship, and no ex
pense was spared in building- and fitt'.ng
her out. The captain.- quarters are the
equal of those of any ocean liner afloat,
while the crew's quarters are well sup
plied. All the latest appliances a.re to
be found on the vesse!, and Captain Mur
chte is Justly proud vt her.
This is the first visit of the Lady Went
worth to San Francisco, and Captain
Murohie has not been here for fourteen
years or more. On nis former visit he
was master of the British ship Peter
borough, but left her to superintend the
construction of his present command.
The vessel has been chartered to load
wheat for Europe, ami as soon as her

Frank Sebrig was ca eight in the act of
burglarizing the cigar stand at the corner

early hour yesterday morning. He
climbed over the iron "rate that protects
the place, and after securing everything
he could pack away he climbed back
again, but was caught by Officers Gwynn
and Green when he reached the ground.
He had five boxes of cigars, under his
arm, but as H. Dabelstein, who runs the
place, says that there are four bottles
of snuff and several nundles of stogies
missing, the police think the prisoner
had a confederate. Sebrig is 18 years of
age arid says he is a laborer. He was
charged at the Harbor Police Station
with burglary.
Water Front Notes.
The wreckage seen by the schooner
Vega is supposed to have been the deck
load of ties washed overboard from the
National City when uhe was off Point
Reyes a few "days ago.

ordered home, as he js very sick, and
Captain Thompson, formerly master of
the Bacchus, but lateiy chief officer of

tain Lewis will go h-/::.o by way of New
York.
The Naval Reserve training ship Ma
rion was docked at Kclsom-street wharf

Ward May Escape Punishment.
A petition for a stay of proceedings in
the case of Bernard "Ward, who was ar
rested in December. 1899, for embezxle
ment from the Marine Firemen's Asso
ciation, of which organization he was
treasurer, was granted by tho Supreme
Ccurt yesterday.
The attorneys for Ward claim that the
judgment of the trial court was illegally
recorded. The alleged error exists in the
partial obliteration or absence of words
supposedly entered by means of a rubbÂ°r
stamp. A fresh entry was made in the
minutes of the court, but the defense
claims that this only complicates the
matter.
Iroquois Braves Meet.
The Iroquois braves met last night at
Pythian Castle in a regular Friday night
session. The point under discussion was
whether or not the word municipal should
be stricken from that section of the by
laws which contains the exhortation for
all Democrats to vote for national. State
or municipal nominees. Max Popper and
others talked on the subject and resolu
tions were offered.
DENIES MOTION
FOR NEW TRIAL
Judge De Haven Sustains
Verdict of Jury in
Dimmick Case.
'Walter N. Dtmmick, ex-chief clerk of
the Mint, will appear in the United States
District Court this morning 1 to receive
sentence on hir conviction for having
failed to deposit. In accordance, with,
treasury regulations, moneys received by
him from the sale of by-products of the
Mint.
Judge de Haven yesterday denied the
motion for a new trial. The following
are extracts from the decision:
The question now presented for decision
arises upon defendant's motjpn for a new triaf.
One of the grounds of the motion and the
only one which I deem It necessary to discuss
la that the verdict Is unsupported by evidence.
â¢ â¢ â¢ It was also shown that the defend
ant received moneys from the sa'e of by-pro
ducts and willfully failed to deposit such
moneys with the Assistant Treasurer of the
United States at San Francisco during the
quarter In which they were received as
charged In the indictment; that such funds
were not deposited until the last day of thÂ»
quarter succeeding that In which they were
received, and that defendant made falae en
tries In the books of the Mint as to the date
when such by-products were sold and moneys
received by him. It is now urged on behalf
of the defendant that his willful failure to de
posit the moneys so received by him within
Ihe time fixed by the regulation above Â»et
out does not constitute an offense under sec
tion 5192 of the Revised Statutes, the conten
tion being that in order to bring the case
within that section It should have been proved
that one of the officers named therein made a
specific demand upon the defendant after the
money was received by him requiring him to
make deposit thereof; and that he failed to
comply with such demand. This argument iÂ»
necessarily based upon the assumption that
the words, "when required, " have the precis*
meaning of the words "upon demand." I Jo
not think the statute should receive this nar
row construction. In Its enactment It wa;Â»
evidently the intention of Congress to make 1Â»
obligatory upon every person having in his
possession money of the United States to de
posit the same when required, that ia at or
within the time required by the officers named
and in my opinion this requirement may be
made by general rule or regulation prescribed
by the Secretary of the Treasury, or other
head of the department which is charged by
law with the control and disbursement of the
fund to be deposited. The words "enjoin '
"prescribe, 1 "direct" aiM "order" are all
synonyms of the word "require." and a gene
ral regulation of the Secretary of the Treas
ury making it the duty of officers receiving
public money to deposit the same at gome
utated time thereafter is in legal effect a re
quirement that the money shall be so depestf
ed at the time named in the regulation vvt
the willful failure to make the deposit as re
quired by such retaliation Is a violation of
section 5492 of the Revised Statutes. â¢ â¢ â¢
The motion for a new trial Is denied.

THE ISTHMIAN QUESTION.
DISPATCHES from Washington announce
that a formal appeal has been made to Secre
tary Hay by the Colombian Charge
a Affaires that the United States observe its treaty
stipulations and maintain free and uninterrupted
communication across the Isthmus of Panama. This
may be taken as a proof that despite its assertions of
strength the Colombian Government is by no means
sure of its ability to cope with the insurgents. Ask
ing the aid of this Government to keep open com
munication across the isthmus is very much like ask
ing aid for the support of the Colombian Government
itself.
In his recent address at the Chamber of Commerce
banquet Secretary Hay said the United States is so
resolved to respect the independence of the various
states of Latin America that not even for the sake
of establishing among them that peace which we so
much desire would the Government do anything op
posed to the dignity or the independence of those
states. That may be taken as an assurance that we
will not interfere between the Colombian Govern
ment 2nd the insurgents. The protection of the isth
mian trade, however, is another thing. We are under
treaty obligations to keep the passage way across the
isthmus open for trade, and should the war interfere
with that trade we may have to act for the re
establishment of order.
The treaty which the Colombian Government has
asked us to observe was made between the United
States and New Granada in 1846, but is still binding
upon Colombia as one of the states in which New
Granada was divided, and the one in which the
Isthmus of Panama b included. In this treaty it is
stated: "The United States guarantee positively
and efficaciously to New Granada * * * the per
fect neutrality of the before mentioned isthmus, with
the view that the free transit from the one to the
other sea may not be interrupted or embarrassed in
any future time while this treaty exists, and in con
sequence the United States also guarantee in the same
manner the rights of sovereignty and property
which New Granada has and possesses over the said
territory."
While it is provided that the treaty can be ter
minated by either side upon giving twelve months'
notice, no such notice has been given and it remains
in force. We have, therefore, not only rights but
duties in the isthmus which we are bound to ob
serve. Unquestionably there have been a good many
investments in the territory that would not have been
made but for the guarantee of the United States.
We have repeatedly sent warships to the isthmus
to watch events and be ready to protect trans
isthmian traffic whenever such protection should be
needed.
The present war has reached a point where it ap
pears the Colombian Government feels itself com
pelled to call upon the United States for action. It
is hardly likely, however, that the insurgents will
venture to interfere with the traffic, since their lead
ers must be well aware that such interference would
bring them into immediate conflict with the United
States. They have as much fighting as they can at
tend to without provoking a quarrel with us. It
may be, therefore, that we shall not have to exert
any force for the protection of the traffic. A word of
warning may be sufficient. The Colombian war is
not our affair, and we are not going to interfere un
less forced to do so by the folly of one side or the
other in interfering with international trade across
the isthmus.
Chicago is disturbed because some outside people
have been filling her markets with "pure honey" con
taining about 60 per cent of glucose, but then she
should remember how long she has been filling the
outside markets with adulterated lard. As it stands
the game is about even.
Lord Rosebery has declared a desire to see an end
to party government in Great Britain, but perhaps
the- tmh is mainly due to the fact that he has no party
" ! 'Â¦' ' WB*t able to get one.
TITE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1901.
THE YUKON CONSPIRACY.
WHEN The Call published to the world the
first information of a plot to capture Daw
son and set up an independent government
in the Canadian portion of the Yukon Valley the
story was received with something of incredulity,
notwithstanding the recognized reliability of The
Call"s news service. One of our contemporaries ig
nored it altogether, probably with the intention of
publishing it later on as an exclusive story. Another
devoted a column of its news to discrediting the re
port, and then stated editorially that it "may have
started, as such stories usually do, as the innocent
fantasy of some imaginative individual/
The Cail did' not publish the story upon idle rumor.
It had reliable authority for every word published,
and knew that despite its seeming improbability the
story was true. A conspiracy to raise an insurrection
in the Yukon Valley, to seize Dawson and set up a '
revolutionary government had been farmed, and,
while its full extent had not been ascertained, enough
was known to alarm the Canadian authorities, to put
American officials on guard and to bring about a
meeting between the officials of the two Governments
to take steps to investigate the affair and to guard
against a possible raid.
From sources other than that from which The Call
received the original information confirmation has
now been given to the story as published. James
Seeley, head of the secret service of tht Northwest
Mounted Police, stated to a correspondent of The
Call at Victoria on Thursday that not only was there
a conspiracy to overthrow Canadian rule in the
Yukon and loot Dawson, but the scheme hatched by
the conspirators for the project was a feasible one,
and had its existence not been discovered by the
members of the secret service in the Yukon and
nipped in the bud the raiders could have accom
plished their purpose and after taking Dawson could
have held the place for six weeks or two months.
Further confirmation was given by E. S. Busby,
Canadian customs officer at Skagway, who not only
made a special investigation of the conspiracy, but
is the bearer of a report on the subject to the authori
ties at Ottawa. Busby is reported as saying that one
of the features of the plan of the conspirators was to
bring from Seattle a large number of men known to
be opposed to the Canadian Government and its rule
in the Yukon and to have them assist in the fight
against the mounted police. Another feature of the
plan was the shipment of rifles from this country for
the use of the conspirators, and money was sub
scribed for that purpose.
In addition to the statements from the British offi
cials a further statement was obtained at Seattle from
a man who claims to have been one of the leaders
in the movement. His statements of course are not
so reliable as those of the officials, but in the main
they agreed with wftat had been obtained from the
official sources, and to that extent serve as confirma
tion of the existence of the plot and of its dangerous
character.
It is worth noting that the story is not so improb
able as it seems at first sight, though we admit The
Call would not have rccepted it from any other than
a thoroughly reliable source. The Yukon country is
filled with adventurous men, many of whom are des
perate. They have staked their all upon the hazard
of striking it rich either in the mines or in the gam
bling houses, and they have failed. They are ready
now to report to any means of getting gold. Around
these daring ones is a host of men some of whom
are dissatisfied with the Canadian Government while
others cherish an abiding hostility to everything
British. Among such elements it is not difficult for a
natural lender of men to find a considerable follow
ing, like that which Walker took to Nicaragua or
Jameson to the Rand. Fortunately the conspiracy
was detected in time and has now been exposed and
exploded. It is not likely the Yukon conspiracy will
be any longer dangerous.
Incited by the success of the Union Labor ticket in
this city some of the labor agitators in Chicago are
talking of putting a h'bor ticket in the field in the
next State campaign in Illinois, and thus does the
effete East try to keep up with the motions of the
golden West.
THE RIOTS IN ATHENS.
MEN who are ready to fight do not concern
themselves much about the nature of the in
cident that precipitates the struggle. Thus
history records many wars that seemingly resulted
from trivial causes. Tasso has told us of a fight be
tween two Italian states over a stolen bucket, and
there was once a long contest between Great Britain
and Spain because certain Spaniards cut off the ears
of an Englishman named Jenkins. With such
precedents in the past we need not be surprised that
the Athenians are rioting and spilling blood because
of a proposal to translate the Gospels into modern
Greek.
Of course the man on the street in Athens cares
a great dcai more about Greek than docs the man
in San Francisco. He has not been accustomed to
dismiss problems for which he cares nothing by say
ing, "They are all Greek to me." It can therefore
be readily understood why he should care something
about the language, but it is not easy to understand
why he should wish to fight his neighbor because the
Government has deemed fit to publish an edition of
the New Testament in the Greek that is spoken to
day instead of in the Greek that was spoken two
thousand years ago.
We are told that the students of the University of
Athens who are leading the rioters have come to the
conclusion that the proposed publication is designed
in the interests of Russia. Queen Olga is by birth
a Russian; she favors the new publication, and
therefore, according to student logic, the publication
would tend to weaken Greek nationality and infuse
Slavism into the hearts of Greek youth.
We are not aware how large a proportion of the
young men of Greece devote their spare time to
reading the Gospels in old Greek or would give their
time to it if published in modern Greek, and con
sequently we are not able to judge the merits of the
cause for which the students are fighting. Possibly
the innovation might be fraught with much danger
to the student body. It might enable the common
people to read the Gospels and understand them just
as well as the university men, and that of course
would be a loss of scholarly prestige. It may be
that some such issue impels the students to rise and
mutiny, but we are inclined to believe that the new
publication is only a pretense for fighting and that
the students have been looking for something to have
a row over for a long time and have taken up this
solely because it gives to the fight something of a
religious, a literary and a patriotic glow.
Whatever be the motive for the rioting, it seems to
be popular. We are told that twenty thousand peo
ple gathered on Thursday evening around the ruins
of the Temple of Jupiter Olympus to cheer the stu
dents who were making a demonstration there. It
would have been an impertinence for an orator in
such a crowd to ask, How many of you read the
Gospels in the old Greek? The only pertinent ques
tion was, Are you agin the Government? To that
there would have been a universal roar for an answer.
They were against the Government so hard that be
fore the police could disperse them thirty were
wounded and nine were killed. Athens had asserted
herself.
YON EDELSHEIM'S IDEAS.
SOME weeks ago a considerable flutter was
caused in Berlin by the publication of a
pamphlet setting forth the tactics Germany
would pursue in case of a war with the United States
or with Great Britain. The pamphlet was Ly no un
known or irresponsible author. It was written by no
less a person than Baron Yon Edelsheim, an officer
in the chief general staff of the German army. It was
that fact which caused the flutter, for such a book
coming from such a scurce seemed something like an
official utterance, and accordingly it made a sensa
tion that extended ever Europe and even to this
country..
So far as we are concerned there is no occasion
for alarm. A dispatch from Washington of yesterday
announced that the German War Office has issued
a formal disavowal of responsibility for the pamphlet,
and that the German Embassador at Washington
had forwarded it to Secretary Hay with suitable ex
planations. In our case, then, the incident is closed.
We never were alarmed or offended by the publica
tion, and consequently we are just as willing to ac
cept an explanation as an apology.
Doubtless explanations have been made to Great
Britain as well as to us, but none the less the issue
remains open. The persistence of the German agi
tation against Chamberlain is recognized in Great
Britain as an evidence of a deep feeling of hostility
among the Germans against Great Britain herself.
The London press treats the subject as a very grave
one, and several papers express the fear that the
clamors of the people may force the German Govern
ment to take some steps against British interests
that may lead to war. Such being the strained rela
tions between the two peoples, there is naturally a
great deal of interest in Yon Edelsheim's pamphlet.
The summary sent to this country of the contents
of the pamphlet is brief, but sufficient to show that
Yon Edelsheim has no high opinion of British troops
or British generals. He declares that in case of a
war between the two powers Germany would take
the offensive and invade England and dictate peace
at London.
Briefly stated the argument of the writer is this:
Sooner or later Germany must fight Great Britain,
because the expansion of German commerce will in
evitably bring the two into conflict. As^ soon as war
is declared Germany would at once send her fleet to
sea while the British were getting theirs ready. By
reason of her greater promptness Germany would be
able to dominate the sea for a time, and during that
time she would mobilize an army and enter upon the
invasion.
After pointing out the shortcomings of the British
troops as revealed in the South African war the
pamphlet goes on to say: "We must also take ac
count of their slight fighting value compared with
well trained German troops. The only troops ready
in England for action are three divisions of the First
Army Corps, about two divisions of the Second and
a combined division of the Third, together with three
cavalry brigades. The strength of an English division
on a war footing is only 10,000 men, while a similar
German division numbers about 16,000 men. Ger
many can transport six infantry divisions, or one
cavalry brigade and five infantry divisions to England
in a very short time. How the operation could be
carried out must not, of course, be explained here.
But this can- be said that it can be done within little
more than thirty hours in favorable weather from
German harbors in the North Sea. Large tracts of
the English coast furnish good landing places for
troops, and the country itself has so many resources
that an invading army could live on them for a long
time. On the other hand the island is not large
enough to allow English troops to destroy a once
victorious hostile army. It is unlikely that such a
war would last very long and considerable reinforce
ments would, therefore, not be needed."
That is the pamphlet for which the German War
Office has disclaimed iesponsibility. It is not pleas
ant reading for the British public just at this time,
and is the more irritating because of the revelation
it makes of German contempt for the British army
and the British navy. Had Yon Edelsheim suggested
an invasion with a million men the British might
have laughed, but to suggest conquest by 100,000
men is something like an insult.
THE BEEF SUPPLY.
CHICAGO reports are to the effect that infor
mation has been received at the headquarters
of the National Livestock Association which
justifies the belief that Congress will have the West
ern public land situation brought to its attention this
winter in a new and startling manner. The report
goes on to say that from an investigation which has
been comprehensively carried out information has
been obtained which shows that during the past five
years there has been an enormous decrease in the
number of cattle in this country, and that the de
crease is due almost solely to the destruction of the
grasses on the public range.
Information of that kind may be "new and start
ling" to Cbngress, but it will not be so to the people
of the West who have given any attention to the
subject. Over and over again The Call has pointed
out and emphasized that very fact. The ranges have
been overstocked, with the' result that the natural
pasturage has been well nigh destroyed. No one has
any permanent interest in reseeding the range or in
trying to preserve such grasses as remain on it. The
struggle for the range has led to repeated outbreaks
of lawlessness and to something like a war between
the rival cattle men and sheep men, whf) seek to get
possession of any tract that promises to yield feed
enough for their stock. *
It is certainly time that Congress' should deal with
the issue in a rational way. By leasing the public
lands the Government could not only obtain a rev
enue from them available for use in promoting irri
gation and the storage of flood waters, but the lease
holders would be encouraged to reseed and pro
tect the grasses of the lands covered by their leases,
and thus a double benefit would at once accrue. The
present wasteful system has been already carried too
far, and the shortage in the beef supply reported
from Chicago is a warning of what will happen unless
a remedy is applied to the evil.
A combination of a paying teller and a receiving

take.

It is amusing sometimes, to lawyers in,
particular, to note how novelists fail into
legal errors dealing with law.
Certainly the worst pitfalls a novelist
can meet with are these. As far a.
country is concerned he may avoid them
by reference to approved textbooks, but
when it comes to foreign and colonial law
it is not so easy to escape blunders.
The validity of marriage and the de
scent of property are dependent upon lo
cal laws that are not readily accessibe.
For instance, glancing through that in
teresting new publication, the Victoria:*
Year Book, of which section 5. d
with law and crime and social condition.^,
has just been published, some important
points of difference that might easily eo
cape the novelist may be noted.
How many people, one may ask
aware that since May. 1890. the law â¢>!?
Victoria was permitted divorce for wil'.f
desertion during three years, or for
itual drunkenness on the part of the hus
ban. 1 . coupled with cruelty and negl â¢
to support his wife; for habitual drur.ii
cnne.sa on the part of the wife, coupled
wjth habitual neglect of domestic d
for a sentence of penal servitude of -
years, after three years have been p
in prison; for an attempt to murder; r r
assault L.-por. the petitioner, if followed by
cor.vieUcn, or for adultery committed in
conjugal residence or under circuru
stances of aggravation?
These increased facilities for divor >
are not open to any person who has n >c
been domiciled in the country fojf at least
two years.
As regards the descent of proiMlljÃ]
land does not pass to the heir, as in Eng
land, but la distributed as personalty.
If the wife dies intestate the estate
does not pass to the husband, as by Eng
lish law, but he gets a third only If I
be children, and a half if there are not
children but only next of kin.
It is suggested that there is room for a
work that should collect these differences
in law In all countries, for the benet:
only of novelists but of ordinary people.
Sands & Co. will publish shortly
Kiss and Its History." This treatise ia
the work of Dr. Christopher Nyrop. v
philologist of high European reputation.
It has gone through two editions ia Den
mark and has been translated Into Ger
man, Swedish and Russian. The book ha 3
now been put into English by W. F. Har
vey, lecturer of English at the Unlve
of Lund, Sweden.
Anonymity apparently has nof yet lost
its value, as there is an advertise
of another enterprising firm offering Â«â¢
prize of five guineas to the first purchaser
of "A Sportsman's Love Letters" who can
give the correct name of the author.
This, they say, is by the way of stimu
lating a healthy curiosity.
Some very noteworthy literary treasures
are to be sold at Sotheby'3 during theflrst
week in December. They include a second
folio Shakespeare and a first edition &(
"Waverley," in three volumes. A year
ago a similar "Waverley" sold in Lon

MYSTERIOUS MURDER TERMINATES
THE CAROUSAL OF A STEVEDORE
Albert A* Mole Is Found Dying on the Sidewalk at the Entrance to
an Alleyway With a Knife Wound Over the Heart*
ALBERT A. MOLE, a stevedore.
was stabbed to death shortly be
fore 4 o'clock yesterday morning
near the entrance to a small al
ley leading south from O'Farrell
street, between Powell and Mason streets.
Mystery envelops the murder, but the
i police are convinced that James M. Do
lan, who is known to have been with
Mole almost up to the moment of his
; death, is guilty of the crime. Dolan has
i disappeared.
Hugh B. B. Chapman, who resides at
! lOSS Howard streei. Is detained at the
i City Prison, as he was with Mole at the
I time of the murder. In a statement
j made to the police, Chapman denies that
I he witnessed the blow that ended Mole's
! life. He admits, however, that he was
: with Mole and that he was only a few
1 feet in front of him when the fatal blow
' was struck. Chapman will be held in
; custody pending the police investigation.
Mole was found lying on the sidewalk
; :n a dying condition by Police Officer
Davis and Special Officer Hugh Smith.
Blood was trickling from a wound in his
; left side, directly over the heart. There
I was a second wound on cr.e of his hands.
j Mole's coat was off and lying Tsy his
side. The street was deserted. The of
ficers found a trail of blood leading to the
entrance of the alley where the fatal
Â¦ blow had evidently been struck. The
- Central Emergency Hospital and police
headquarters were immediately notified
of the crime, but before the hospital am
bulance arrived Mole was dead.

THE STEVEDORE WHO WAS STABBED TO DEATH EARLY YESTER
DAY MORNING, THE PRISONER WHO WAS WITH HIM DURING
HIS DEBAUCH AND THE MAN SUSPECTED AS THE MURDERER.
Hamill, who were detailed on the case,
took Chapman into custody shortly after
the discovery of the tragedy, as they
learned that he had been with the de
ceased. At the City Prison Chapman
made a detailed statement as to his and
Mole's movements during the previous
evening, and up to the moment of the
stabbing. He stated that he met Mole !
by appointment Thursday night and that
they together visited several saloons,
finally arriving at the saloon of Kauff
man & Campbell, at the corner of Mason
and O'Farrell streets, shortly after 3
o'clock yesterday morning. Tnere they
met and became acquainted with Dolan,
who treated them.
After leaving the saloon the three men
went to the Afton lodging-house at 285
O'Farrell street. They rang the bell and
requested Robert Gregg, who answered
the call, to arouse a woman who lived
there. Before this could be done the men
changed their minds and separated.
Their subsequent movements as told in
Chapman's words were as follows:
I started down the steps and Dolan came
after me. We walked down O'Farrell street
and the first thing that I knew was that Mole
was falling. I ran back to catch him. I
think that he had one arm out of his coat.
He did not speak to me, although I called
his name several times. While I was . look
ing for Al's hat I saw a man running diagon
ally across the street toward the Union Square
market restaurant. At that time I thought
that the man fleeing was Dolan. but I cannot
c ay now who the man was. I cannot remem
ber positively having seen Dolan after leaving
the Afton House.
I would not consider that at the time Al
fell either of us was- badly Intoxicated. Al
had no money with him, as when we went
Into Kauffrr.an's saloon he wanted to borrow
$1 from me. I had never seen Dolan previous
to meeting him In Kauffman's, and I don't
think that Al knew him any better than I did
I am a union stevedore, and bo was Al.

SUESSER IS SENTENCED
TO DIE BY THE NOOSE I
SJayer of Sheriff Farley of Monterey
County Condemned for the'
Second Time.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 22.â Unless the Su
preme Court interfere George Suesser,
who killed Sheriff Farley in Salinas, in
September, 1899, will suffer the death pen
alty in San Quentin on February 7. This
was the sentence pronounced by Judge
Lorlgan this afternoon.
Attorney B. A. Herrington, counsel for
Suesser, occupied the afternoon in argu
ment for a new trial. Irregularity in
transferring the trial of the case from
Monterey County and errors of court were
urged as grounds. Judge Lcrigan denied
the motion for a new trial. When Suesser
was ordered to stand up for sentene a
broad smile was on his face and he turned
around and winked at the Sheriff and
deputies and paid little attention to the
Judge's remarks.
Suesser's attorneys will at once appeal
to the Supreme Court. This is the second
time Sutsser has been sentenced to be
hanged. The Supreme Court set the first
sentence aside and gave him a new trial
on the ground that he had been denied a
change of venue from Monterey County,
where the people were highly prejudiced
against him.
WICHITA, Kans., Nov. 22-D. J. Tangney,
proprietor of the Topeka-avenue Hotel Jn thli
city, was struck on the head about 5:30 o'clock
this morning with a heavy hammer by a burg
lar whom he surprised In the act of robbing the
Uotel. Tangney Is not expected to recover.
The police do not give much credence
to Chapman's stury. They are of th*
opinion that after leaving the Afton
House a drunken brawl arose between
Mole and Dolan and that during the
quarrel Dolan plunged the knife into
Mole's breaat. They are also convinced
that Chapman witnessed the deed.
Dolan is a partner of W. C. Hudson of
the San Francisco Upholstering Company,
208 McAllister street. The police main
tained a watch at that place yesterday,
but neither Dolan nor his partner ap
peared. Dolan is said to be the son of
Michael Dolan, an old-time politician.
Mole was about 37 years of age. He was
a stevedore and bore the reputation of
being a steady worker. Although mar
ried, he and his wife did not live together
In searching for a motive for the crime
the police discovered that Mole shot at
two men who had followed him home last
Saturday night. Mole attended the steve
dores' ball, and while on his way home
he noticed two men following him along
Market street. They kept behind him un
til he reached his home at 134 South Park
After he entered his house the men at
tempted to force an entrance and he
tired a shot at them.
The police do not think that the shoot-
Ing of Saturday night has any bearing on
the murder.
Police Arrest Dolan's Wife.
At an early hour this morning Clara
Dolan, wife of James Dolan. the man who
is suspected by the police of having mur
dered Albert A. Mole, was arrested and
taken to the City Prison. No charge was
placed against her, but the police intend
to retain her, believing that she mayâ¢
induced to divulge the whereabouts of
Dolan. At the same time a man whose
name the police refused to make public
was taken into custody. It was rumored
that he was also connected with Mole's
murder.
r-ENALIZED FOR CARRYING
TOO MANY PASSENGERS
Chmers of Three Nome Steamships
Pay Heavy Fines to the
Government.
SEATTLE, Nov. 22âThe United States
Treasury is being replenished to the ex
tent of $24,660 by the owners of threo
Nome steamshipsâ the Roanoke, the Port
land and the Valenciaâ for violations of
the customs regulations, in carrying pas-
EÂ«n#ers from the north in excess of the
license limit. On Thursday the owners of
the Valencia put up $9660. The Portland's
owners and the owners of the Roanoke
have signified their Intention of navin"
$6650 and $8350, respectively, as fines for
similar violations of the Treasury Depart
ment regulations. All these moneys are
being paid under protest and the case is
to be taken up later with the Treasury
Department officials at Washington.
The management of the respective ves
sels say they did not willfully violate the
law. While at Nome they obtained spe
cial permits to carry stated numbers of
passengers in excess of their license limit
The customs officers of this district, how
ever, decline to recognize the permits on
the ground that such can be given only
by the United States marine Inspectors of
hulls and boilers.
Peter Cassidy Not Guilty.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 22. -The trial of Pe
ter Cassidy, charged with the murder of

BIG LAND DEAL
IS CONSUMMATED
More Than Six Thousand
Acres Near Stockton
Are Sold.
LO3 Angeles Capitalists Will
Raise and Oan
Asparagus
A big land deal was consummated yes
terday in this city. Several capitalists of
Southern Californ'a bought 6300 acres of
reclaimed land seven miles from Stockton
from the California and Nevada Dredg
ing Company. The land is on the line of
the Santa Fe Railway and the purchase
price was a quarter of a million dollars.
Those who formed the company are
Frederick H. Rindge of Santa Monica,
Dr. John R. Haynes of Los Angeles, Wal
lace brothers of Pasadena, R. C. Gillis
of Santa Monica, George T. Cochran of
Los Anceles and Lee A. Phillips of Los
Angeles. The land will be improved to
the highest possible condition and will be
used to raise vegetables. A canning plant
will be erected on the place and aspara
gus will be grown and canned for the
Eastern markets.
Lee A. Phillips, a prominent young at
torney of Los Angeles, negotiated the
deal. He left for Los Angeles last even
ing highly elated with the result of his
labor.
"We feel that we have a big thing," he
said yesterday. "California grows the
finest vegetables in the world and only
through companies being formed to raiso
products in large quantities will the repu
tation of California vegetables be estab
lished.
"Senator Jones of Nevada was a largo
| shareholder in the land we have pur
chased. Negotiations have been pending
for some time. We all came up from
Southern California a few days ago de
i termined to bring the matter to an issue.
| We return with the documents all signed
in our possession."

This Course Is from th* Pen of the Well
Known Authority, George H. Powell.
[From "Success."]
Mr. Powell., who furnishes the matter
for the entire series, Is a man of untiring
energy and enthusiasm, having devoted
his entire life to the practical, theoretical
and artistic study of the subject. *He is
conversant with the most successful
methods emplo>c;d in the production of
effective advertisements, booklets and
auxiliaries which are of value in secur-
ing that most desirable element known as
publicity.
Mr. Powell is to-day considered by
those best competent to judge as one of
the most skillful planners and writers of
advertising in America. Some of his
achievements are notable.
Entering the field in 1891. he quickly
revolutionized bicycle advertising and set
a pace that was never equaled. Later he
astonished patent medicine men by dem-
onstrating his ability to float a new arti-
cle and make it highly profitable the first
month.
Next came Mr. Powell's work in build-
ing up the advertising department of one
of the largest woman's publications in
America, and. in a year his methods added
nearly $50,000 worth of extra business, be-
sides materially improving the quality of
the advertising.
About three years ago Mr. Powell es-
tablished himself in New York, and be-
sides making thousands of dollars from
another proprietary article of his own,
he has helped scores of others to win
through up-to-date publicity.
As a counselor and planner 1 of adver-
tising campaigns Mr. Powell stands first
among experts, and he is paid the highest
fees by scores of our largest advertisers
with whom he is in constant touch. There
isn't a week that he is not sought for in
pushing to the front stock deals or new
manufacturing enterprises.
To benefit hundreds who are anxious to
earn from $25 to $50 a week in advertis-
ing writing, and to supply advertisers
with competent he.n, Mr. Powell will give
free instruction to all who take advan-
tage of the opportunity. Address George
H. Powell, lo- Temple Court, New York.

TAXES REACH
TO A MILLION
Decision Given in Chica
go Traction Com
pany Cases.
Injunction Is Dissolved and
Equalizers Fix Assess
ments.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.. Nov. 22.â ap
plication of the Chicago Union Traction
Company and the Consolidated Traction
Company for an injunction restraining the
State Board of Equalization from assess
ing the capital stock of those companies
for 1900 was denied this afternoon, by
Judges Grosscup and Humphrey in the
United States Circuit Court. The tempo
rary injunction Issued by Judge Grosscup
?n Chicago on Tuesday was dissolved.
Immediately after the decision was an
nounced assessments aggregating $75,000,
090 and involving over $1,000,000 in 1900
taxes were made by the State Board of
Equalization, as the fair cash value of thÂ«
capita.! stock of the traction companies
over and above the assessment on. their
tangible property. The $75,000,000 valua
tions made take the place of the $3,500 000
valuations made last year, as representing
the fair cash value of the property as
sessed. The Teachers* Federation esti
mate was ?125.000,000.
No written opinion in the case was filed.
JudsÂ« Grosscup stated orally at length
the reasons for the decision, explaining
that later Judge Humphrey would file a
written opinion. The method to be fol
lowed in determining the value of capital
etock for purposes of taxation was dis
cussed by Judge Grosscup at length. As
to bonds, he said, the judgment of the
money lender might be reasonably safe, !
but with capital stock it was different. It
â¢would be grossly unfair to base the as
sessment upon the stock values quoted on
the Stock Exchange. These were fre
quently, if not generally, determined by
circumstances quite distinct from the real
value of the stocks in question.
He cited, as an illustration, the North
ern Pacific flurry a few months ago. Then
nobody would contend that the real value
of the stock exceeded par. yet the quoted
pricÂ© reached $1000. Nor had any court
decided that the Equalization Board must
be governed by the quotable market prices
of capital stock. He continued:
The bill in this case assumes that the board
trill not now exercise its independent judicial
function, but will confine itself to the mere
arithmetic of adding- together the indebtedness
end stock exchange quotations of the capital
etock. We are not at liberty to concur in this
assumption. We believe and are bound to be
lieve that the board trill exercise its function
us contemplated by the law. This will exclude
the supposed danger of gross discrepancy and
the supposed danger of overvaluation. If it
transpires that the board or equalization at
tempts to certify an assessed value that in its
effect would be a fraud upon any taxpayer,
thÂ« courts will remain open to the Injured tax- |
payer. The board should be just as the State ,
wishes to be, irrespective of the past and with
out partiality, and this we will assume until
the contrary appears. The motion for prelimi
nary injunction will be overruled and the tem
porary restraining order dissolved.
KILLS HIMSELF
TO ESCAPE MOB
Lompoc Wife - Beater
Fires Bullet Into His
Brain.
LOMPOC. Nov. 22.â Fearing the wrath
of citizens who were battering down the
door of his dwelling, intent upon enforc
ing a demand that he leave this vicinity.
J. A. Burns, a wife-beater, committed sui
cide here last night. The tragedy ends
a career of cruelty and indolence that has
long aroused the wrath of the residents
of LÂ«ompoc, and no sympathy is wasted
over the dead man.
Burrs several years ago beat his father
in-law almost to death. Since that time
he has not permitted his wife to visit
her parents and several days ago, while
his mother-in-law was on her deathbed
begging to see her daughter. Burns locked
his wire into a room and threatened to
kill any of her folks who dared to come

On the day of her mother's death Mrs.
Burns was compelled by her husband to
prepare a feast and partake of it and he
would not permit any of his family to at
tend the funeral.
Indignant citizens yesterday ordered
Burns to leave town. This he refused to
do and ho threatened to burn the town if
any one molested him. Last night, at 10
clock, more than 100 citizens called at
his home and asked him to come out, as
they desired to have an understanding as
to his future conduct. He refused to
emerge from his dwelling and the citizens
proceeded to go in after him.
The door was ordered broken in by the
leader, and immediately two shots were
heard within. When the door was broken
In Burns was found in a dying condition
The first shot had made only a slight
fcalp wound, but the second bullet en
tered the right eye, emerging above the
left ear.
The family is not in poor circumstances,
but citizens will bury Burns and provide
a fund for his widow and two children

ME. SEYGARD SINGS "CARMEN"
IN PLACE OF MADAME CALVE
De Marchi Makes a Hit
in Role of the
Soldier.
Seygard Very Pleasing*
Under Most Trying 1
Conditions.
By Blanche Partington.
IT was a friendly though small house
that gathered to hear "Carmen" last
night at the Grand Opera-house, wilh
Camille Seygard in the title role.
There was the natural regret for
Catvc'i non-appearance, but the audience
was good tempered and determined evi
dently to make the best of things.
"Carmen" might better have been titled
."Don Jose" last night, De Marchi in the
role carrying off most of the honors. De
Marchi's work grows on one. His voice
improves with acquaintance and he was
at his best last night as Don Jose. His
Rudolfo in "La Boheme" of last Sunday
night showed him-an actor of ample intel
ligence as well as a spirited and dramatic
singer and his Don Jose deepens both im
jire=.~ior.i--. He was immediately en rap
poH with the part, singing and acting it
better than any one we have had here,
to a nattering appreciation by the audi
ence.
Mme. Seygard, who has frequently sub
stituted for Calve in the part, was the
Carmen. Mme. Seygard is not Calve, of
course, but gave a neat rendering of the
role that must be received with the defer
ence and gratitude due to the substitute
f<n all occasions and in all places. She
has a good, full contralto voice, not start
ling in quality, nor very brilliantly used,
but pleasing and fitted to the part. Mme.
Seygard v.as naturally nervous, and in
addition to the rather trying conditions
had only once rehearsed the role with De
Marchiâ who himself sang his part in
French for the first time last night. The
singer seems to lack rather on the tem
peramental side, but looked a pretty
gypsy and seemed to please the house.
Scotti repeated his excellent Escamillo,
receiving again a rousing encore for the
"Toreador" song, to which he responded;
Mr. Declery was a weak Zuniga. as be
fore; Mr. Gilibert and Mr. Reiss were
again very good brigands and Miss Bau
ermeister and Mme. Van Cauteren were
effective as Frasquita and Mercedes.
Suzanne Adams as Michaela did even
better, and it was very good, than on
Wednesday evening.
This afternoon Eames will again be
heard in her lovely Elsa in "Lohengrin,"
with Van Dyck as the Silver Knight and
Schumann-Heink in her best part as
Ortrud.
To-night "II Barbiere di Siviglia" is the
bill, with another splendid cast, includ
ing' Sembrich, De Reszke, Campanari and
Salignae.

Chinese Are Alarmed.
PORT TOWXSEND. Wash., Nov. 22.â
According to advices from the Orient
brought by the steamship Kinshiu Maru,
which arrived to-day, considerable ex
citement prevails in China over the atti
tude of the United States relative to the
exclusion law and alarm is teu among a
large number of Celestials now in China
who are entitled to return to the United
States. As the present exclusion law ex
pires In May, 3902. the basis of the fears
of the Chinese is that a new law will be
enacted of such a stringent nature that
many of the privileged class will be
barred from returning and hundreds are
preparing to rush to the United States
before the law expires.

Attendance Is Reduced
Owing to Change
of Singers.
Sybil Sanderson Net Able
to Appear Sunday
Night
THE inability of Madame Calve to
sing in "Carmen" last evening- at
the Grand Opera-house made a big
difference in the size of the audi
ence.
The house had been sold out well in ad
vance, but when ticket-holders learned
yesterday morning that Calve could not
sing there was a big rush to the box of
fice of the theater to exchange seats for
other nights when Calve is announced to
eppear.
That Manager Grau and his associates
have the sincere sympathy of the public
In the matter was displayed yesterday by
very few persons asking for the return
of money for tickets for last night's per
formance.
Manager Grau is indeed unfortunate
this season in the weather affecting the
heaith of some of his stars. As if the
Impresario did not have trouble enough,
he learned last night that Sybil Sanderson
was suffering from a severe cold and
would not be able to sing In "Les Hugue
nots" to-morrow night.
Mme. Camllle Seygard undertook a dif-.
ficult task last night in appearing as
Carmen in place ot Madame Calve. The
theater presented many vacant boxes and
seats in orchestra, dress circle and gal
leries, but those present were generous
to a degree in the matter of conferring
applause.
There was an absence of display of rich
dresses by the ladies and there was ab
solutely no promenading between the
acts. Even the curious who gather to
watch the buds, belles, matrons and men
alight from their carriages did not gather
in front of the opera-house, and Captain
of Police Spillane and his men had an
easy time.
There was no disposition on the part of
the audience to compare Mme. Seygard
to Calve, as it would have been manifest
ly unfair to the brave singer who under
took the role last night under most tryr
ing circumstances.
Mme. Seygard is a beatiful woman and
she charmed all by her dashing presence
and dramatic force. De Marchi, the
tenor, who for the first time sang Don
Jose in French, and Scotti, the Toreador,
and the balance of the cast were all re
cipients of applause and recalls to the
footlights.
This afternoon "Lohengrin" will be
given, with Eames, Schumann-Heink.
Van Dyck, Bispham, Muhlmann and
Blass in the cast. The bill for to-night
is "II Barbiere di Siviglia." with Sem
brich, Campanari, Salignae, Bauermeis
tcr and De Reszke in the principal roles.
In the lesson scene Sembrich will sing
"Voce di Primavera," composed for her
by Johann Strauss.
To-morrow evening "Lefi Huguenots"
will be given at popular prices, presenting
Gadski, Louise Homer, Bauermelster,
Dippel, Scotti, Muhlmann, Bars, Dufriche
and Suzanne Adams in the cast. The
superb aggregation of talent for the Sun
day night offering is causing a big de
mand for seats.

to the guests for luncheon, which was
followed by a social hour. The affair was
successful in every way-
The Friday fortnightly of the Cotillon

CHIEF WITTMAN
USES GLAD HAND
Receives Many Congrat
ulations and Flowers
From Friends.
Says He Will Not Make Any
Radical Charges in the
Department.
The glad hand waved in Chief of Po
lice Wittman's office yesterday from foggy
morn till dewy eve. Those who could
riot cume for a Berry shake sent the
happy tidings over a wire or through the
mail. It was all sunshine and flowers for
the new Chief -whose right hand is now
aching: with cramps and his voice'hoarse
from saying "Thank you."
"Of course, I'm glad," said Wittman.
"This is no job for a day. I'm here for
four years, no matter what they say
about new Commissioners and that sort
of thing. The best legal opinion has been
given me on the subject. If they attempt
to put me out they must prefer charges
and chow cause. I'll fight for my rights
every time." And the Chief of municipal
bluecoats and long- clubs sat harder in I
his chair and held on to the flower be
strewn desk with both hands.
Will Improve Department.
"No, I haven't formed any "plans yet,"
continued Wittman, "but it is safe to say
that 1 will make no radical changes.
None are needed. Of course, there will
be some changes, but just what they will j
be cannot be announced at this time. You j
see, this is my first day and I've been
pretty busy answering telephone mes- '
sages and returning tne friendly giip of i
congratulating friends."
Then the Chief lilted back his chair and
swept his eyes around the gallery of c-x
rulersâsome dead, others forgotten. "The
office of Chief of Police is a business af
fair and must be conducted as such. I !
am going to try to make this department j
worthy of the city. San Francisco is |
growing rapidly and in ten years will be ''
a very great municipality. Its Police !
Department must keep step with this
growth. 1 shall use ail my native strength
to fulfill the duties of the position and
make San Francisco proud of its police
force."
At this juncture the Chief was inter
rupted by a few stragglers of the glad
hand army. Some knew that the oest
man had been appointed and others were
just as full of hopes and good wishes. [
The Chief worked his arm in pump fash- !
lon and smiled on a/B,
Many Congratulatory Telegrams.
The office of the Chief looks like a bow- !
er. His New York police <.riends havt
been more than congratulatory. From \V.
H. Mc-Laughlin, Deputy Chitf of Police i
of New York City, he received a hand- i
some floral stand. George McClusky, cap- ;
tain of detectives in New York, likewise
remembered him. Walter L. Thompson, I
police inspector in the same city, now on '
a visit here, sent a big star of ehrysan- ;
Uiemums. A box of violets was the to- j
ken from the Mexican Consul. Other
flora] gifts were scattered about the office 1
in sucn profusion that the new Chief
tripped over them every time he arose. ;
At half past 5 yesterday afternoon Com- â¢
pany A lined up and was addressed by j
the Chief. He toid the men that merit .
would be the keynote of the service; that :
they should fear nothing as fung as they
were in the strict lines of duty, and that
the rights of citizens and property must
be protected.
Down in the graystone building with ;
the big clock there is much guessing over Â¦
elevations. The appointment of Wittman !
leaves two vacancies in the captaincies. !
The six lieutenantsâ Birdsall, Martin, An- !
derson, Price, Mooney and Esolaâ are .
singing songs that might as well be made !
into a sextet, for the words are the same.
All appointments can be but temporary,
however, for the civil service ru^es apply. ;
Chief Wittman was given an ovauon j
last evening by the members of the I
Northern police station.
Shortly after 5 o'clock about 300 mem
ben of the department assembled at the j
Central station to express their gratifica
tion at the selection of Captain Wittman
as the successor to the late Chief Sulli- ;
van.
As the officers fell in line Chief Witt
man, accompanied by Commissioners
Newhall and Howell, entered and were
vociferously cheered.
Lieutenant George Birdsall introduced
the new Chief and in a few well chosen
words paid a high compliment to his !
abilltv as an officer.
Wittman then addressed the men amid
great enthusiasm.
"If I were the brightest orator," he be
gan, "I could not express my delight in
the reception that you gentlemen have
accorded me. We have all met under try
ing circumstances when we were called
' out only a short time ago to protect life
| and property. That we did our duty no
i body can truthfully deny. The Police
I Commissioners saw fit to make me Chief,
and I Intend to prove to them that they
I made no mistake when they promoted
me to the responsible position. I want
you all to obey orders and you will find
in me a friend. My office is open to you
at all times, and when you want advice
don't hesitate to ask me. I am proud
of the department and Intend to do all in
my power to make it second to none in
the world."
At the conclusion of his remarks the
new Chief was loudly cheered by his men.
As he stepped from the improvised ros
trum he was presented with a magnifi
cent floral piece, bearing the inscription:
"Success to Our Chief. Co. A."
Lieutenant George Birdsall made the
presantation speech and was followed by
Lieutenant John Martin, who in a few
words paid a fitting tribute to the new
head of the department.
Commissioners Newhall and Howell also
addressed the men and were loudly
cheered.
To-day Chief Wittman will address the
officers of the Southern station.

herein Â»et forth.
"Votes of thanks were extended to the
chairman, executive committee, press and
others.
While waiting: for Rev. Peter C. Yorke
to put in an appearance requests for
speeches were made and Senator Bulla
was forced to take the platform, and he
said In part:
I am only going to say from the stage what
I attempted to say at my seat, that 1 do not
think that this is the time for me to make any
remarks to this convention. In the first place,
â¢with some other devoted souls, I was at work
until 9 o'clock this morning on the memorial
and the resolution!!, and we have be?n at work
all day on them, with what success you have
Just heard. I will only say in addition to that
that I want to emphasize the necessity and
the importance of continued watchfulness on
the Dart of the executive committee of this
convention. I never have yet known a cause
so just that it could win itself, or would care
for Itself. It must have constant attention,
anxious and energetic attention to make it
succeed.
I believe that the Congressional delegation
from the State of California is able. I know it
will bo watchful for the purpose of carrying
out the object of this convention; but I say
to you that, with all of the multifarious duties
that will be Imposed upon them in the city
of Washington, they will need assistance from
the outside; they must have it in order to
succeed as we e-toect them to succeed in the.
efforts which we have Inaugurated here to
day. And so the crowning effort of this con
vention should be in the selection of a proper
committee, of an earnest and enthusiastic com
mittee to attend at Washington to assist our
delegation there in carrying out the purposes
of this convention.
I thank you very kindly, gentlemen, for
calling on me (Applause.)

hy Mayor Phelan was received with ap
plause.
There was a lull In the proceedings un
til Father Yorke appeared. When the
wel. known priest was escorted to the
plutform he was greeted with applause.
Cl airman Geary Introduced Father Yorke,
who sDoke as follows:
We are now face to face with an immigra
tion which its emphatically not Christian,
have nothing to say about the ideals or about
the morality oi the Chinese. They may be very
gouti in their own place and that is in China.
(Laughter.) But aa somebody has defined dirt
as matter cut of place, ao we may say that
the virtues of the Chinese, be they never ao
great and never so tittine for their own coun
try, are out of place in this. Their thoughts
are not our thoughts; their blood Is not our
blood; their outlook is not our outlook. They
have a different way of looking at things.
And they have this, gentlemen, which is the
most important of all: They have such a
power or numbers that what perhaps they
might not be able to accomplish by the su
periority ot their morality or by their more
acute ingenuity, they can do by brute force.
The greatest man that ever lived is powerless
against the force of the elements. It was a
great and powerful king who stood before the
advancing waves of the sea and said to them.
"Thus far and no farther," and the sea poured
over him and his royalty. It is the same with
us. We may be in the^lead of all the nations,
we may have the most acute intellects, we
may have the highest education, but what
are we against this great sea which is beating
now urwm our shores, which is as Â»
tidal wave and which if we do not build up
our battlements high and strong may over
whelm us and everything we hold dear. (Ap
plause.) Therefore, gentlemen, because the
Chinese civilization Is not our civilization, be
cause their ideals and their outlook are dif
ferent from ours, because they would build up
here something that would be entirely con
tradictory to our Institution?, that Is the first
reason why every American, no matter whether
he lives upon the Pacific Coast, or on tha
Atlantic, by the shores of the Great Lakes, or
by the shores of the gulf, is bound to stand
with California and with the Pacific States in
their demand that the walls be built up against
tfea Chinese immigration.
When the applause subsided cheers were
flven for Chairman Geary and Father
Yorke and the convention then adjourned
sine die.
MAYOR-ELECT SCHMITZ
WAS UNABLE TO ATTENTD
Sends a Letter Expressing His Ideas
' on the Exclusion of the
Chinese.
Labor had its inning at the afternoon
session of the convention. Mayor-elect
Schmitz, leader on ihe labor unions'
ticket, was unable to attend, and sent the
following letter:
WATSON VILLE. Cal.. Nov. 20. 1901.
To the Chairman of the Chinese Exclusion
Convention, Metropolitan Temple. San Fran
cisco â Dear Sir: I regret that I shall be unable
to attend the meeting of the Chinese Exclusion
Convention, but teg to express through you to
the convention my earnest and sincere sym
pathy with the objects of your meeting.
The Chinese as a race must be excluded from
our shore; from Injurious competition with our
labor: from obstructive Interference with our
Industries and from damaging contact with our
civilization.
This is not a problem of race prejudice, but
one of conservation of our American homes and
our American life. Indeed, the question of Chi
nese exclusion is no longer a problem at all. It
is a demonstrated proposition. No one on this
coast who possesses any social or political in
telligence and foresight can see two sides to
the question. There is but one. The Chinese
must be excluded. The Chinese exclusion act
must be re-enacted and Its provisions fortified,
and it should be made also to embrace Japa
nese, whose unchecked immigration is becoming
even aa disastrous as that of their Chinese
neighbors.
I believe In the protection of American labor
against the cheap labor of foreign lands and tn
the protection of the American laborer and his
home and family against the invasion of Mon
golian hordes.
For any assistance or support in furtherance
of these views and the objects of your conven
tion 1 shall ever be at your command.
E. E. SCHMITZ, Mayor-elect.
Cheers were given for Mayor Schmitz,
and when the applause subsided Con
gressman Woods secui;-i the attention of
the convention and said:
I forgot this morning in that razzle-dazzle
talk of mine (laughter) to make of you one re
quest for the delegation; and that Is that wo
don't want you to bite off here more than we
can chew in Washington. I mean by that this;
If we can re-enact, in the presence of the pos
sible opposition which we will have there, the
Geary act with the proposed amendments
thereto, we will have achieved a great victory
â¢ applause) and let the Japanese question abide
a while .and we will take care of that a little
later. (Applause and cries of "Good.")
\V. A. Cole, a member of Carpenters'
Union 483, was next introduced and
was given a hearty ieception. He re
ferred to the failure of the Chinese to
assimilate the customs of the country and
expressed the opinion that the declaration
of the Chinese Exclusion Convention
would have great weight with Congress
as it represented every phase of life in
California.
Mr. Ryan of San Jose followed and
spoke of Chinese conditions and the ira
bility of laboring men to compÂ«te with
these mere human machtnes.
J. A. Mclvor expressed the opinion th*t
laboring men throughout the United
States would come to the aid of Califor
nia and bring about the exclusion of the

Cured of His
Rheumatism
The Remarkable Experience of
a Rheumatic Sufferer.
Suffered Intensely lor Two Yearsâ Could
Get No Relief Until He Took
Haipruncr's â Cured in
Two WeeKs.
A poor, lame sufferer came hobbling
into Dr. Halpruner'3 offlcÂ© on crutches
about three weeks ago.
Hi 3 every movement signified pain and
dreadful suffering.
This poor man had rheumatism tn his
legsâhe could barely walkâ he had suf-
fered for two years and during this time
had taken many medicines and spent
much money with well known doctors.
He was in the throes of agony and al-
most without confidence in any cure.
Dr. Halpruner provided a seat for the
sufferer and made him as comfortable a Â»
possible, and as soon as he regained his
composure he told a story of pain and
miseryâ tlie result of contracting a severe
case i~t rhtumattsm.
For many years this poor man worked
as night nreman in a manufacturing es-
tablishment, where- he would become
overheated from his work, and as his
hour of quitting was 5 in the morn-
ing he would go out of the warm
fireroom into the cold, brisk morning air.
On ono severely cold morning this ma i
was taken with severe pains in his legs.
He was laid up with rheumatism for sev-
eral months, and after taking the best uf
care of himself seemed to get better. But
as soon as he resumed his labor hl3 rheu-
matism returned, and he had not been
without pain for almost eighteen months.
He tried every medicine he had read oC
and visited scores of doctors, all of whom
prescribed medicines for him to take. Ho
took everything that was recommended
for his rheumatism, but it still remained;
the pains were still there and he would
get no relief and was compelled to suffer
tortures that only a person who haa haÂ«l
rheumatism can appreciate.
A couple of weeks ago this sufferer no-
ticed the announcements which claims!
that Dr. Halpruner' 9 Wonderful Medi-
cine would cure rheumatism.
Thi3 poor sufferer had so little confi-
dence in advertised cures and paid littia
attention to the announcements until he
read of IV. Halpruner giving trial treat-
ment free, and he finally decided to visit
Dr. Halpruner and see what could ba
done for his rheumatism.
Dr. Halpruner gave him a trial treat-
ment with Halpruner's Wonderful MÂ«d.-
cine, rubbing the medicine thoroughly
Into the painful parts. He also gave him
an internal dose, and in less than two
hpurs' treatment the patient felt consid-
erably better. The pain had left him, b> ;
he still complained of .weakness. Dr.
Halpruner gave him a bottle of the Wor.-
derful Medicine and advised him to take
a teaspoonful every two hours and to
apply the medicine thoroughly to the af-
flicted parts two or three times a day.
Last week this same patient walked
into the doctor's office without the aid i
the crutches and apparently as well and
spry as any man, and claimed that he
was entirely cured of his rheumatism,
and most sincerely praised the effective-
ness of Halpruner'a Wonderful Medicine.
All druggists sell Halpruner's Wonder-
ful Medicineâ 50c and $1 a bottle. The
dollar size contains three times the quan-
tity of the smaller size. Some druggis i
may try to talk you out of it, but pay no
attention to what they have to say and

CASTRO JAILS
WAR MINISTER
President of Venezuela
Suspects a Conspir
acy Exists.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Thursday, Nor.
Si. via Haitien cableâ President Castro,
believing that a conspiracy to overthrow
him existed, caused the arrest to-day at
Puerto Cabello of Raymond Guerra, tne
Minister of Wor. The President also
brought about the arrest at Caracas of a
cumber of partisans of Guerra, amon?
them Mor.taubon. who claims to be a
French citizen.
The arrests have caused a great sensa
tion. Joachim Garido succeeds Guerra as
Minister of War. President Castro be
lieves Senor Ma! Os and General Reira and
Juan Pietri to be concerned in this con
spiracy against his authority.
WILLEMSTAD, Island of Curacao,
Nov. 22, via Haitieu cable.â President
Castro has cabled his representative
here, saying the present revolutionary
movement, which Is beginning to be
called the Matos revolution, has been
frustrated. The truth of his statement
is denied, here, where it i? stated this rev
olution has not yd begun. A steamer
alleged to have on b/>ard 600,000 cartridges
and 13.C0C Mauser rifles, destined for the
use of Venezuelan revolutionists, is ex
pected to arrive in the West Indies about
the middle of December. The representa
tives of this revolutionary movement now
here say the revolt will start after these
arms end ammunition are available, and
that the movement will receive the active
cr passive co-operation of large numbers
of Venezuelans who. they say, are becom
ing tired of the existing state of affairs
in Venezuela, which Is characterized by
President Castro's political opponents as
the "state of anarchy and persecution
created by the Castro government."
From itcent report? received here it
eppears 'hat p number of Inoffensive
traders and citizens, incapable of start
ing a revolution, have been arrested in
Venezuela at the Government's orders. It
is further said that these political pris
oners are to be held as hostages for a
premeditated forced loan by the Govern
ment.

POSTUM CEBEAJ..
FIXED THE MINISTER.
And He Needed Looking; After.
"In a minister's family in Los Angeles,
where I was visiting some time ago, the
wife complained of serious Indigestion
and dysi>epsia. She admitted that she
used coffee and said she more than half
believed that was the trouble. I told her
that I knew it was the trouble, for I had
gone through with the experience myselT
and had only been cured when I left off
coffee and took up Postum Food Coffee.
"She said she had tried the Postum, both
for herself and her husband, but they did
not like it. With her permission, I made
Postum next morning myself, and boiled
It full fifteen minutes after the real boil- j
ing: of the pot began. Then when It was i
served it was a rich, deep brown color and
had the true flavor and food value that
every Postum maker knows. It is all fol-
ly to talk about trying to make Postum
with one or two minutes' steeping.
"You can't get something good for noth-
ing. It must be boiled, boiled, boiled, and
to keep it from boiling over use a small
Jump of butter, perhaps twice the size of a
pea. That morning the minister and his
wife liked Postum so well that their
whole lives were changed on the question
of diet and they abandoned coffee at once
and for all time.
"Now, after a hard day's work, they are
comforted, refreshed and rested by a cup
of well-made Postum for supper. They
are both enthusiastic In Its praise. The
wife has entirely recovered from her dys-
pepsia. I will not go into the details of
my own case except to say that I was a
desperate sufferer with dyspepsia, and \
discovered, by leaving off coffee, that eof- j
fee was the cause of It. I quickly got well
when I took up Postum Food Coffee. I
earnestly hope many more coffee drinkers
may get their eye*} open." Name and ad-

Clerk Gilkey Drops His
Suit Against Mrs.
Northam.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22.â Stanley D.
Gilkey has changed his mind about press
ing his breach of promise suit for $50,000
against Mrs. Robert J. Northam. The
case was dismissed to-day.
The filing of the action was the sequel
to the rather sensational marriage of
Mrs. Northam. She was, before her mar
riage to wealthy Colonel Northam, Miss
Leotia Kej'll Stoney, and filled a position
as stenographer for the Los Angeles Her
ald. She is a blonde, tall, handsome and
stylish in appearance. She met Colonel
Northam about two months before their
marriage, which took place on July 23.
The husband was 52 and the bride 20
years of age.
In his breach of promise suit Gilkey.
a young man of 22 years in the employ
of a local clothing firm, alleged that on
April 1 Mrs. Northam, then Miss Stoney,
promised to marry him, and that August
15 was set as the date for the wedding.
Mrs. Northam at the time the 6ult
was filed declared that she had never
been In love with any one but Colonel
Northam, who was also made a party to
the action. She admitted that she might
have imagined herself in love with her
young admirer, but declared that the en
gagement was broken off by mutual con
sent on June 10.
Gilkey and his attorney, F. W. Allander,
and Mrs. Northam and her attorney, E.
A. Meserve, were at the Courthouse to
day to dismiss the suit.
At the time the action was begun Col
onel Northam asserted that if the case
were not carried to a trial he would sue
the plaintiff for malicious persecution.
To-day Mr. Gilkey's representative asked
the defendants if this threat would be
forgotten If the case were dismissed. The
answer was in the affirmative and Gilkey
dropped his legal proceedings.
Mrs. Nbrtham said to-night that no
money was paid to Gilkey and there was
no compromise. It was a surrender on
the part of the plaintiff, who, she says,
saw that no good could come to him from,
the action.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER '23, 1901.
OIL MEN FROM
SOUTH TESTIFY
They Fear General Rate
Reduction Would
Hurt Them.
Railroad Commissioners Se
cure Very Little In
formation.
The second day of the rehearing of the
oil rate case before the Railroad Com
missioners developed little that was new.
The complainant resumed with the pres
entation of the testimony of A. J. Samu
els, secretary of the West Shore company,
which does business in the Kern River
district.
Mr. Samuels was positive that the re
duction of rail rates for moving Califor
nia oil from the San Joaquln Valley
points to San Francisco would be of bene
fit to the oil industry. The switching
charge, of which so much has been said,
he also regarded as unjust. His company
produces 1200 barrels of oil dally.
T. L. Reed, one of the original exploit
ers of the Kern River district, who is con
nected with the Reed Crude Oil Company,
testified that his company has twenty
two producing wells and can produce 2000
barrels of oil per day. Reducing the
freight rates would help producers. Con
tracts made with the clause that reduc
tions in freight rates shall go to the con
sumer would benefit the consumer. It
would be beneficial to the industry to
have the switching charge stopped.
W. A. Bissell of the Santa Fe testified
that the Santa Fe has a eoptract under
which 1 cent per barrel is paid to tne
Southern Pacific Company for oil hauled
over the Kern district switch for the
Santa Fe. His company, he said, has no
financial interest in the switching.
Los Angeles Views.
Thomas A. Hughes of Los Angeles tes
tified for the defense that oil is selling
in Los Angeles at 40 cents per barrel. The
price has been going down and the con
dition of the oil industry in Los Angeies
is bad. There is an excess production
there of from 15,000 to 300,000 barrels per
month. No coal was used for, making
power in Los Angeles when oil sold for
$1 65 per barrel, and no coal is sold there
now for that use. Oil is used exclusively.
Formerly Los Angeles sold its surplus in
San Francisco ana got $1 50 per barrel for
It before the Kern fields were discovered.
He did not think that lowering the rail
rates to San Francisco would benefit the
producer, for the price for oil would fall
just the same amount of the reduction
because the competition of the producers
is so sharp and they will take what they
can get. To Mr. Short the witness said
on cross-examination that under normal
and permanent conditions the price for
oil in the market and the rail rate both
being fixed, a lower rail rate, being taken
rom the cost to the consumer, would
cause greater consumption of oil.
Thomas O'Donnell of Los Angeles testi
fied for the carriers about as Mr. Hughes
had. "When the Kern River district pro
ducers could get together and act to
gether they will be benefited by lower
freight rates. At present they will
not be benefited by a lower rate.
Attorney Short examined on this
line, and the witness said also that to
raise rates would not benefit the pro
ducer. He was of the opinion that if the
railroad charges for moving oil were
reduced all over the State injury wouid
result to the Los Angeles oil producers,
ahe rate on oil from Bakersfleld to Los
Angeles is 52 cents.
"Well," said Attorney Short, "that Is a
good protection for Ljs Angeles "
Manager Edward Strasburg of the Oil
Storage and Transportation Company of
J^os Angeles agreed with the two pre'eeu
ing witnesses on the point that while tha
Kern County produceis are not compet
ing so keenly and the price is so low, a
reduction in freight rates would not ben
efit the producers. Fitly cents per barrel
was none too much tor the Kern oil at
the wells. There would be no trouble to
get $1 per barrel for the oil in San Fran
cisco. At that price oil could crowd out
all other fuels used for power making
Los Angeles cannot produce oil as cheap
ly as the Kern River district. When oil
goes below 70 cents per barrel in Los An
getes that means a loss to the producers
ban Francisco would consume as much
oil at $1 per barrel as it would at 75
cents per barrel.
Â« ra Â» k A ' parlutt of Los Angeles testi
fied like the other men from Los An
geles about the freignt rate reduction
that was asked for. While 50 cents for
oil at the Kern River wells might pay a
profit for a time to the producer it
would not permanently, he said. He ai
mitted under cross-examination that un
der permanent conditions lower prices for
fuel oil would be better for manufac
turers.
At the afternoon session Senator R N
Bulla and Attorney J. A. Graves, both
of Los Angeles, were examined. They
were called by the Southern Pacific Com
pany to show that a reduction of the
freight rate from B<ikersfield to San
Francisco would seriously militate
against the profits of the Los Angeles oil
producers.
Senator Bulla Testifies.
Senator Bulla testified that oil had prac
tically taken the place cl coal in Los An
geles, and that $1 50 per barrel was very
cheap. He said the reduction and price
to 60 cents a barrel and less has not ma
terially increased its consumption He
ascribed this statement to the fact that
jus=t so much oil would be consumed un
der present circumstances, and unless tl c
output was curtailed the price at the
wells would be dill further reduced
"In my opinion." continued the Senator
"a low freight rate tends to reduce the
price of the oil and brings no benefit
either to the producer or the consumer "
In response to a question from Attorney
Short. Senator Bulla delved into the pro
tective tariff proposition, holding that
while a high rate was good for the pro
ducer in one locality, :t might not be so
good in another.
Witness Graves, under coaching from
Attorney Herrin, said that he was "a
lawyer who had wandered from" the fo^
to go into the oil business." He gave an
interesting resume of :he fluctuatians in
the prices of oi! in Los Angeles since its
discovery.
"I think," continued Graves, "that if
freight rates were reduced the price of
oil would still go lower. At presen*
prices there is an absolute and sinful
waste of $20 gold pieces, and the on'y
remedy is in a combination to store and
control the output. The Bakersfleld field
alone will supply the whole State of Cal
ifornia for a century."
As the Southern Pacific Company had
no more witnesses on hand, at the conclu
sion of Mr. Graves' testimony an ad
journmont was taken i:nlil Monday after
noon at 2 o'clock, when representatives
of the Santa Fe and the Southern
Pacific companies will testify.

live on Alta street, Telegraph Hill, have
not lived in neighborly fashion for a long
time. Yesterday John Parata appeared
before Judge Fritz on a charge of bat
tery upon Herbert Johnston, a young boy.
It was alleged that Wednesday night
while the boy was going home with his
aunt, Parata, who had secreted himself
behind some bushes, sprang out upon the
boy and struck him on the face. The
aunt tried to protect her nephew, but
was brushed aside by Parata. Parata
was convicted and ordered to appear for
sentence this morning.

LOWELL AND BERKELEY TO PLAY FOR FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP
HIGH SCHOOL
ELEVENS IN A
DECISIVE GAME
Arc the Best Two Representatives
of the Academic Athletic
League.
The deciding and naturally the most
important game of the Academic Athletic
League football series will be played this
afternoon at 3 o'clock on the Sixteenth
and Foisom streets grounds. The semi
final games have been completed . â¢ and
Berkeley and Lowell High schools / will
fight on the gridiron for the championship
of the Western Academic League. Both
elevens have made an excellent record
and are clearly the best teams in the
league. .Berkeley is one of the heaviest,
averaging 157 pounds to the man, while
Lowell is the lightest, wi'h an average
of 148 pounds.
Last year representatives of these
schools contested for the championship.
Lowell winning by a score of 6 to 5. Kee
gan. Kidd, Vos Burgh. MacKinne and
Hamilton, who were in the winning team
last year, are playing again this season
and in improved form. Hamilton and
Vos Burgh are undoubtedly two of the
best men in the Academic League.
Kern, on Berkeley's team, and Plum
mer, captain, are also excellent players.
In ail a close, hard contest is expected
between the two teams, which are evenly
matched, except as to weight. This, how
ever, as ehown in the last varsity game,
does not count for much.
Rooter clubs from both schools will en
deavor to cheer their team on to victory.
A big attendance is expected of students
arc others interested in the schools and
also of those who like to see a good, hard
fought game of football. The field is
rather muddy and heavy. Hudson of the
University of California and Clay of the
Olympic Club will alternate as referee and
umpire. The teams will line up:

PICTURESQUE ATHLETES
INTRODUCE SPORT VASCO
Exciting Game Is Seen in All Its
Beauty on the Court at Cen
tral Park.
"Sport Vasco," the highly developed
game of handball imported here from
Mexico, was played in this city yesterday
for the first time. A fair sprinkling of
the Mexican colony and a number of
handball experts saw the introduction of
the game. Music by a band enlivened the
occasion.
It does not require a knowledge of the
game to understand its sensational fea
tures. The players, wearing canvas shoes,
white duck trousers and striped jerseys,
presented a picturesque appearance on
the court. Their catching and throwing
of the ball with their "chistera," or
wicker scoop, showed remarkable skill
and cleverness.
The first match between the "blues,"
Careaga and Lasa, and the "reds."
Tucumman and Guerrlta, was won by the
former by a score of 20 to 13.
In practice the prettiest play was whore
a group of men stood about the midda- of
the 208-foot court and sent the ball to ;hc
front wall, each man taking it on thr Jiy
in his turn.
At times during the game the ball JtÂ£
returned so strongly that it rebouvsj^d
from one wall to the other without toucli
ing the court.
The first public game will be played
Thanksgiving day.
HOUNDS WILL MEET
NEAR BURLINGAME CXUB
Ground Is in Condition to Com
mence the Season With San Ma
teo Hunt Club Draghounds.
The rain has now softened the ground
sufficiently for cross-country riding, and
already one Informal run of the San Ma
teo Hunt Club has been held. A regular
meet of the club will take place In front
of the clubhouse of the Burlingame
Country Club on Thanksgiving day at
S:3O in the morning. A list of fixtures for
the coming month 5s being prepared by
Colonel Walter S. Martin, secretary of
the Hunt Club, and will be issued to
members in a few days.
Hunting is still holding its own in Great
Britain, notwithstanding the Inroads
made by wire fencing. There are twenty
packs of staghounds in England and five
In Ireland. England supports 166 packs
Of foxhounds, Ireland twenty-six and
Scotland eleven. Of harriers there are 115
packs in England, forty-five In Ireland
and four In Scotland. There are fifty-one
packs of beagles and eleven of stag
hounds. Thfe is a total of 454 packs in
the United Kingdom. Among them are
registered 24,000 hounds, with probably as
many more "out to walk," that is being
raised by farmers for their owners.
Scotchmen Form Club.
A considerable number of enthusiastic
Scotchmen of this city and Oakland held
a meeting last night at Scottish Hall for
the purpose of organizing a bowling club
Officers were elected, committees were
appointed and by-laws were adopted at
the meeting. The Park Commissioners
have Instructed Superintendent McLaren
to construct a bowling gTeen in Golden
Gate Park on the old music stand site for
the use of the members of the club.

RAIN RETARDS
PLAY ON THE
TENNIS COURTS
The Enthusiasts Watch Their
Opportunities to Play Be
tween Showers.
The wet weather of the past week made
play on the tennis courts rather light. A
few enthusiasts took advantage of the
occasional dry periods and some good
matches were played. The courts in
Golden Gate Park dry much more rapidly
than most clay courts, because of the oil
on the surface. The clubhouse being built
in the park is a substantial one and is
being fitted with every convenience. Play
ers will be supplied with both lockers and
shower baths.
Probably the most interesting tourna
ment from the players' point of view is
the straight handicap singles. An affair
of ihis kind was held last Sunday on ihe
California Club courts and proved a suc
cess. In a class tournament as a rule,
one man in each class is so far superior
to the rest that the outcome is never in
doubt. In a straight handicap there is
more uncertainty, and each man has or
should have, an equal chance. In the
tournament of last Sunday the "sixth"
system of handicapping was employed and
worked smoothly. This system has been
in use for several years In the East and
it is surprising that local cracks have
been so slow to recognize its merits. Each
man is given a number according to his
ability, and as the handicaps are all fig
ured out in the Guide, the odds received
by each player can be seen at a glance.
Certain men enter the local tournaments
with the intention of playing only one
match and if they win this match they
put out some man who is desirous of play
ing throughout the tournament. As a
remedy for this it might be well to sug
gest that these men withdraw before the
rinal point is played and let the match go
tojihe loser by default. Much better re
suits would be obtained if this were done.
Four men are left to fight for first hon
ors in the handicap singles tournament,
which will be completed to-morrow. These
men are Erskine. Gibson, G. N. Armsby
and Grant Smith. The latter is the
scratch man and will meet Erskine, wh i
will receive a handicap of "thirty "
SMuld Smith reach the finals his oppo
nent, whether Armsby or Gibson, would
receive odds of "thirty and one-sixth."
The park courts are exceedingly popu
lar, but are not numerous enough to ac
commodate the hordes that swarm to the
park on Sundays. Many more courts will
have to be built, as the players will be
much more numerous by spring time.

LEASHMEN LOOK
FOR PALO ALTO
TO MEET BEACON
America's Best Hcunds Are Prom
ised for Next Wetk's Cham
pion Stake.
The champion stake which has beon
announced by the Union Coursing Park
management for next week's attraction
is awaited with eager anticipation by tae
patrons of the sport.
Among other features, and one that
will bring out the leasnmen in force, is
the fact that America's greatest grey
hounds, Palo Alto and Beacon, have been
promised for the even:. With these rival
coursers entered in a sixteen-dog stake,
the probabilities of their meeting in the
final are more than good. The possibility
of such a deciding course is enough to
enthuse every follower of the game.
As a youngster. Beacon had a shade
the better of Geary's speedy one in the
matter of winning performances, bin
later Palo Alto commenced to improve,
and to an extent that he was awarded
the palm, not only as the fastest dog In
America, but was cor.pidered the equal
of any courser ever b.'ed.
The black and white champion has
shown his ability to outdo Curtis' next
best hound, young Rector, in any ki-d
of a trial, and is not lacking in support
against any other hour.d now in the run
ning.
Beacon's long: retirement had' a de
pressing effect on his admirers, and as
stake after stake was drawn without a
mention of the great blue dog's name,
the coursing entnusiasts gave up hope cf
seeing him on tne fieM, in form again or
at all. When Curtis nominated his kennel
king-pin for the big John Grace cup
stake the wise ones declared that the
long respite from open coursing trials
had dimmed the probpects of Beacon's
chances of getting within the big money.
As the stake progressed, however, and
Beacon showed a derived improvement
after each course the knowing ones were
not slow in figuring that Curtis was Dut
for first money and had his champion
ready and primed to ?o the distance for
the much-coveted honors.
Beacon's complete victory over his ken
nel mate places him Â«t the head of the
list of class performers, with only Paio
Alto, and probably Sisquoc, having a
chance to deprive him of his exalted posi
tion, for this season at least.
Albert Curtis has bred Cavalier to
Cash. This experimental inbreeding rep
resents a double cross through Rockette.
Cavalier being Ly Emm Pasha and Cash
by Chartist, both whelped by Rockette.
Curtis once before tried inbreeding
through Rocketle, with poor results. Bea
con, by Skyrocket, wu bred to her, sl'e
by the same sire. Fly by Night and Bed
of Ro-ses, ordinary performers, weic
whelped by this cross..
Fortuna Favente has been bred to a
hig-h-class greyhound sent on by George
Dayton of Lincoln, Neb.
Wayfarer was bred to Metallic Octo
ber 19.
Pylvanus was bred to Jennie Wilson
November 17.
The last service of the late For Free
dom, the wonderful courser and sire,
was to Flyaway, she by Flying Buck-
Carmen. November 2. The litter will be
raised by Captain Condrey of Sacra. Â¦
mento, who reared the open plains cham
pion, Aeolus, and will i c eligible for next
year's Futurity.

Semi-Annual Interclass Rac:s in
Four-Oared Barges to Be
Held To-Day.
The Boating Association of the Univer
sity of California will hold its semi-an
nual inter-class races this afternoon on
San Antonio Estuary. There is a keen
spirit of rivalry among the crews, each
being confident of victory. Last year the
sophomores won the four-oared barge
race, and this year's junior crew contains
three of last year's sophomore crew. *Tne
course is one mile in length, beginning at
Webster street bridge and finishing near
Sessions Basin, where tne spectators w'll
gather to witness the results. There wili
be two preliminary heats, freshmen vs.
sophomores, and juniois vs. seniors. The
final will be betwee* Ihe two winners.
The senior crew consi^ta of Gorrill, bow;
Grundelflnger, No. 2; iX. Kelly (captain),
No. 3; E. H. Harley, stroke, and J. Ep
pinger, cockswain. The junior crew con
sists of B. H. Cerf, bow; W . Brown, No.

Geddes, N. A. Denoir, W. M. Ross,
Charles Wilson, W. McGee, E. C. Sten
berg, Johnson Hardy and W. T. Howe,
members of committee. The assistance of
the other city boat clubs has been prom
ised and a large attendance is expected.
The regatta of the Olympic Boat Club
at Belvedere on Sunday was highly suc
cessful, the water being smooth and the
day bright and pleasar.t. Except for the
fact that the short hours of daylight pre
clude crews from practicing together in
the evening the winter season is much
more suitable for rowing than the sum
mer. The removal of nearly all the yachts
and several of the arks into the lagoon
behind Tiburon leaves the waters of the
cove more unobstructed than in summer,
when it Is scarcely possible to pick out a
clear course for boat racing. Vlven on
Sunday a small boat anchored in the
course proved a serious obstacle to the
outrieged skiff men on their return after
rounding the stakes. If the Olympic
boatmen succeed in getting a new and
commodious clubhouse at Tiburon rowing
will enjoy quite a boom among them and
some good oarsmen should be developed
from so large a number of athletic young
men as are to be found in the Olympic
Club.
At the annual meeting of the Amateur
Athletic Union recentl-' held in the New
York W. B. Hinchmah of the Alameda
Boating Club, president of the Pacific
Association, was chosen a vice-president
for the coming year. 1,. E. Sharp, a well
knov/n Eastern nthlete, acted as repre
sentative of the Pacific Association. The
telegraphic reports of the meeting do rot
state what disposition was made of tne
application of the local association to ex
tend its jurisdiction over Oregon, Wasn
ington and the Hawaiian Islands.
Two Footpads Under Arrest.
John Connelly, who gives his occupa
tion as a marine fireman, was arrested
early yesterday morning by Policeman
McNamara and Detectives Ryan and
ODea on a charge of robbery. The com
plaining witness is R. Ornes of Menlo
Park, who came to the city Thursday.
He had such a good time that he missed
the last train and continued his libation?.
About daylight yesterday morning he left
a saloon at Fifth and Mission streets to
go to the depot to catch the first train
for home. He was followed by Connelly,
who knocked him down, it is alleged, and

HANDBALL PLAYERS NOW
ENGAGED IN THE OLYMPIC
CLUB TOURNAMENT.
HANDBALL MEN
COMPETE IN THE
OLYMPIC COURT
Excilingf Contests in the Various
C asses of the Championship
Tournament.
Unusual interest is being shown in the
handball tournament of the Olympic Ath
letic Club. All available space in the gal
lery is taken every night by enthusiasts
who applaud the clever plays when they
are not shooting shafts of wit at the play
ers. The standard of the game is unusu
ally high, while the court, according to
Fitzgerald, the world's champion, has no
equal in this country.
The playing has been close, showing
clever handicapping on the part of Cap
tain George James and J. J. Gleason, who
had it in charge.
Handball has taken a firm hold on the
members of the club, having attracted
many men from other forms of sport. It
at once furnishes exercise and relaxation
as h player cannot take business or other
caros into the court when he is opposed
by a lively antagonist.
The games last night resulted as fol
lows: George James beat N. A. Hewson
21-12; 6-21; 21-3.
M. Green beat R. B. Bowman, 21â6
21â20.
T. I. Fitzpatrick beat F. C. Wejrener
21â19; 21â IP.
The games to-night will be between W
Cartwright and G. Littlefield; T. Powers
and T. Kennedy, and H. Cordes and C. K.
Melrose.
HEIRS SEEK TO HAVE
A DEED SET ASIDE
Claim Property Was Conveyed With
out Any Other Consideration Than
an Unfulfilled Promis3.
Lilian B. Hardy and Harriet A. Parlin
are suing Ada C. Martin, administratrix
of the estate of Robert Craig Chambers,
to recover two-thirds of a tract of land
in Butte County which they allege they
conveyed to Chambers a short time be
fore nis death.
They allege that the Butte County Jand
was part of an estate beaueathed to
Chambers in trust for them by Mrs
Chambers, their aunt. According to their
complaint, they were living with their
aunt when she became Mrs. Chambers
and were treated with such kindness aft
er the marriage and after the death of
Mrs. Chambers that they had no hesi
tancy in complying with Chambers' re
quest that they deed the property to him
especially, as they allege, when he told
them that after his death they would be
well provided for.
Chambers died intestate in April, 1901.
and no provision was made for them by
the heirs of his estate, which is valued
at $1,500,000. They now want the deed of
conveyance set aside and their title to
the property, which they allege was part
of a separate estate owned by Mrs. Cham
bers, restored.
Fishermen Attack an Officer.
Deputy J. H. Davis of the Fish Com
mission had an encounter with a gan;?
of five illegal fishermen at Rodeo Thurs
day night. Davis located some law
breakers at Rodeo and apprehended them
in the act of pulling undersized fish into
their beat. He caught one of the fellows
and the other four ran away. The pris
oner also escaped while the deputy waj
getting the paraphernalia ready for trans
portation to some place where it might
be stored pending a settlement of the
case. The five men then returned with
knives in their hands and made a fierce
attack on the officer. He drew his re
volver, however, and after a few shots
the attacking party fled.

enter, while Worthington Ames and Leon
ard Chenery are yet to be heard from.
The contestants will go round in pairs,

STORM UPSETS
CALCULATIONS OF
DUCK - SHOOTERS
Do Not Expect Good Sport Unti 1
the Weather Conditions
Settle.
The storm of tne present week has up
set the calculations of the gunmen and
they do not expect good shooting again
until the weather settle*. The rain has
formed ponds in every direction and the
ducks are scattered over a wide area.
The men who shoot about Mount Eden
were counting on the high tides which
will come to-day, to-morrow and Mon
day to provide ponds which would at once
attract the ducks and kill the mosquitoes,
which are a great pest. The rain did
some of the work the tides were expected
to accomplish.
Up in Kichardsons Bay, near Sausalito,
there are thousands of canvaabacks. iuey
are difficult to approach, as they shy ac
any moving object and seem to keep just
outside the range of a shotgun.
Three members of the Willow Lodge
Club secured eighty ducks last Sunday at
their preserve near Mount Eden.
Otto Priest secured fifteen ducks near
Mount Eden, L. Thiebault getting four
and Joe Bigerstaff six.
Oscar Fisher and a friend killed twen
ty-six quail near Belmont.
O. Schwaners killed twenty-two quail
near the same place.
Paul Kingston secured twelve canvas
backs on the Alameda Gun Club pre
serve, near Surf, on the Sonoma marsn.
Frank Schultz will try the marsh about
Mount Eden to-morrow for ducks.
The members of Spooney Gun Club se
cured about a dozen birds each on their
Mount Eden preserve last Sunday, in
the party were: L. R. LArzalere, Pull
Bekeart, Dr. Short, George Morse and
Mr. Guyatt. Had Che rain held off they
counted on great sport to-morrow owing
to tha unusually high tide.
The members of the Field and Tule Club
are noted practical jokers and are always
looking ror new victims. President A. M.
Snields is cheir latest same, and was
compelled to stand a lot of their badinaga
last Sunday. It all came about through
his claim to distinction as a caller of
ducks. He stood on the veranda of the
clubhouse near Suisun and without arti
ficial aid commenced to give the mallard
call. Soon it was taken up in every direc
tion and the marsh seemed alive with
ducks, although none were in sight. Mr.
Shields did not know it at the time, out
his fellow-members had armed themselves
with duck calls and were answering him.
The members of the club enjoyed excel
lent sport on Sunday. J. B. Coleman was
high gun. getting the limit baÂ« of fifty.
Among the members on the marsh wera
-. T. Wirtner. H. B. Hosmer, W. Bay.
H. L. Miller, Louis Titus, J. Homer
Fritch, A. M. Shields, Dr. A. T. Derby
anu F. V. Bell.
Seventy-five head of elk, the last rep
resentatives of great herds which at one
time roamed over the San JoaQuin Val
ley, are becoming a problem to people
near Bakersfleld. The oil derricks have
driven them down into the valleys from
the foothills and they are becoming quite
destructive. They are at present on the
Miller & Lux ranch. Under the State law
they are carefully preserved. They are
not molested, although a vaquero will
once in a while throw a riatta over one
just for a little recreation. There is a
general desire to see these animals in
crease in number, as otherwise they will
meet the fate of the buffalo and become
only a memory to be described by men
who saw them when they roamed about
In vast herds.
LICENSE FOR AN ENGINEER
IS REVOKED FOR FRAUD
Captains Bolles and Bulger Discover
That R C. Maushardt Made
False Representation.
Captains Bolles and Bulger, United
States Local Inspectors of Steam Vessels,
issued an order yesterday revoking the
marine engineer's license of E. C Maus
nardt on tne ground that he had obtained
it by means of false representations. The
inspectors discovered that Maushardt had
made false statements aa to his having
served his time in Joshua Hendy's shop,
and that he had been third assistant en
gineer on the Laurada on a trip to
Alaska. The facts were found to be tha:
Maushardt did not so serve his time and
that he was on the Laurada in the capa
city of a passenger. On September 30 at
this year Maushardt obtained from the
inspectors a license as first assistant en
gineer of ocean steamers. November >
he made application to the inspectors for
a, raise to that of chief engineer or con
densing uay and river steamers. The in
spectors placed him under oath last
Wednesday and he admitted the falsity
of his claims and confirmed the reports
that the officials had received concerning
the matter.

BEDECK FIRST FOR A HANDICAP
THROUGH O'CONNOR'S CLEVERNESS
Three Favorites Finish in Front at Oaklandâ Norford and His
Brother Forkford in a Fighting Finishâ Native Wins.
I is not often that one of Winnie
O'Connor's mounts is found kicking
* about on the bargain counter with
the price marked Oown from original
cost. However, vh.s> was the case 1.1
the betting on The Pi^isanton handicap
yesterday at Oakland. The track was
muddy, and this fact a' ne always causes
pood guesscrs to be in much greater d?
mand. There were but live starters, ai.d
four of these -were all looked to have a
royal chance. For this reason there
scarcely was an actual favorite. Ohia
closing at 2 and Sea Lion 11 to 5. Rio
Shannon caught some cf the target prac
tice shooters' p;ay at 16 to 5. while Con
r.or's mount, Bedeck, with 10S pounds up,
floated back from 2 to 4V 2 and some 5.
To a pretty Piece of riding can be
ascribed the win of tlie latter horse.
While J. Wcods on KlO Shannon ar.u
loar astride Sea Lion were busy cutting
furrows in the tiack, O'Connor made his
move with Bedeck three furlongs from
home, blazing his wav through on the
inside. By this he gained three lengtns
and was enabled to make the other two
twing wide into the stretch. About this
time Shannon fagged and Sea Lion was
compelled to travel .in the slant of U:e
hog-oack course. Consequently. Bedeck
won by :nore thai a U-UKth. Obia, which
had more thar. her Bfaare of ill racing
luck early in the race, closed strong aÂ»d
only lost the place to Sea Lion t>y a
head. Old Rubicon iv-jain went to work.
and showed a speck ot ins old-time spâ¬~l
for the first quarter.
Three favorites split up the boodle with
a like number of outsiders, the longest
priced outsider to out his name down on !
& diploma being Commissioner Forster, a
10 to 1 shot. Last time the Commissioner
canae to town he forgot to bring anything
with him, but yesterday was on parade
with a full dress suit. In fact he furnished
a. real surprise.
Owen Mounce, on Ned Dennis, a luke
warm, favorite, took the first sprint
Searchlight and Lou Clieveden raced out
in the lead and when, they tired Mounce
passed by with Dennis, winning easily.
Although Billy Moore, favorite for the
mile selling run, with O'Connor in the
saddle, wen. he was not entitled to the
purse. Ransom, on El Oriente. apparent
ly could no? keep his horse from bearing
out at the stretch turn, relinquishing- the
lead to the favorite. From there on it
took all of O'Connor's skill to land the
first choice in front by a length. Bullman,
on Koenigr, ran third.
M. Daly's youngster. Sir Lewis, had his
odds played down to favoritism in the '
speculating en the two-year-old dash.
Pocketed right after the start and com
pelled to ramp the overland route, he fin
ished fourth: Johnny Woods dropped
from the clouds with Commissioner Fors-
Ter and earned the verdict in a nose fin
ish with St. Sever, the second choice. .
Two brothers, Norford and Forkford.
fought it out for the long end of the fifth
purse. Just as the banner was released
Bernota, the favorite, wheeled into Edu
cate and both were practically left. When
Fcrkford seemed to be winning. Bullman,
en Norford, got up and, driving hard,
scored by half a length.
Harry Stover had Native ready and the
chestnut horse won the last race in a hard
drive from Tiburon. The winner's odds
were backed from 5 down to 2.
Track Notes.
TOlie Apple*rste. who had a profitable season
of it on the block East, arrived last evening
f rcm Chicago.
Henry Spencer accepted bis first mount on
liorinel and as the horses cantered to the post
received the same hearty greeting from the
crowd accorded the other returning- Eastern
riders. Apparently the little mare no longer

closing event, M formerly owned by Sam
Kildreth. When right good he Is a horse of
considerable class and â¢â¢Jess' Matthews put
up an old-faahloned finish on the gelding.
MicFiecknoe, a hcrse given away for a song
last spring by "Doc" Street, had been prepared
for a watermelon carving in the first sprint.
He showed tome early speed and then finished
among the "also rans."
Norford until within a week ago iras trained
ty fnlinrsr Campbell. He now sports the col

old Stewart Memminger Julia Ann Hunt,
3 years old, ran away with her youthfui

for some time. While her mother was
in another room Julia crept through the
back door of her parents' home, and met
the youngster, who, according to a whis
pered council that followed, waa to be her
future husband. His home is next door to
hers.
"Yeth," lisped Julia, when her gallant
lover had broached his plan for overcom
ing parental objections; "yeth, we'll run
away and get married."
The two started with an air of deter
mination. They wandered off toward the
lake and did not bother themselves about
the world and its troubles until love's
dreams began to be disturbed by the
pangs of hunger which overtook Stewart's
promised bride along toward noon
They finally lost their way. The chil

NO CURTAILMENT
IN AUTHORITY
OF R. B. MILROY
Onerous Duties of Secretary of
New California Jockey Club
Are Merely Divided.
The story in an afternoon paper yester
day to the effect that Secretary R. B.
Milroy of the New California Jockey Club
had been shorn of his authority proves
to be a misstatement of facts.
In an interview last night President
Thomas H. Williams Jr. said: "Mr. Mil
roy has not been shorn of any authority.
"With continuous racing the duties which
devolved upon Mr. Milroy became so
heavy that It v.'as almost a physical im
possibility for one man to perform them
properly. Since the time of the old
Bay District track until this sea
son there have been two associa
tions racing alternately. This gave the
executive officers a respite every two
weeKs in which they could catch up on
their work. It was to relieve the enor
mous strain on Mr. Milroy that Mr. Price
was made secretary and manager.
"Mr. Milroy is one of the oldest, most
representative and most respected racing
officials on this coast. He was an earnest
worker in the days of the Blood Horse
Association, the parent body from which
the racing of the present day sprang. He
has been through all its ups aad downs
and has contributed much to the success
of the snort.
"We ielt he deserved to be relieved of
some of the heavy duties which the posi
tion of secretary entails. Hereafter^he will
give his attention solely to the work of
the office, Mr. Price relieving him of the
outside duties. There will be no change
in his salary, that remaining as it has
been, neither will there be a curtailing of
his authority."
Harvard Meets Yale ToDay.

would meet in the morning to definitely

This" came as a surprise, as "Harvard
men had no knowledge, and in fact they

by Yale or any one else upon which to
base the question of Cutts' ineligibility.
Cutts' substitute is Dick Lawrence, broth

"NOT SOBER!"
SAYS A MAJOR
Officer Who Accuses
Col. Meade Makes
Admissions.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â When the offi
cers who comprise the court which is try
ing Colonel Meade resumed their investi
gations to-day Captain Benjamin A. Ful
ler, assistant judge advocate, who was
judge advocate at the court of inquiry
held in the navy yard last July, testified
to what had taken place there.
On cross-examination the witness stated
that once when he was on duty at the
Boston navy yard Major Lauchheimer
came to his (Captain Fuller's) room and
said he had just come from tho Puritan
Club after closing it up.
"What was his condition? Was he
sober or tight?" asked Lawyer Semple.
"He was under the influence of liquor,"
replied the witness.
\ihe witness then went on to state that
he had induced Major Lauchheimer to go
to his room, but the major returned later,
having removed his outer garments, ana
Captain Fuller had to draw a curtain over
the window in order to screen his visitor.
Major Lauchheimer was recalled and in
answer to the judge advocate said that
he had not solicited the orders which di
rected him to inspect the marine barracks
in Brooklyn in June last. He emphatic
ally denied that he had in any way tried
to injure Colonel Meade, and said that
he had never entered into any conspiracy
or league with any person in order to In
jure or retard Colorfel Meade in his suc
cession to the position of brigadier gen
eral of the marine corps.
In reply to the judge advocate in direct
examination the major said that in Sep
tember, 1897, he had been ordered to Bos
ton, where he was in consultation with
the District Attorney for several days
regarding a legal matter in connection
with the department. He was a guest of
Captain Kane at the navy yard and had
dined at Captain Kane's house prior to
going to the progressive party at Colonel
Meade's. He had a cocktail before din
ner and probably some claret during the
dinner that evening, and went to Colonel
Meade's house in company with Captain
and Mrs. Kane.
He said he was absolutely sober on
that occasion and did not arrive late. He
never appeared at any gentleman's house
in a maudlin condition and he denied that
his conduct on that evening was anything
other than that of a gentleman.
He told of his being the guest of the
Puritan Club in Boston and said that on
one occasion he had given a dinner to
five or six gentlemen whom he had-met
there in recognition of their being ex
tremely courteous to him during his vis
its to the club. On cross-examination Â«by
Lawyer Semple the major admitted that
the party had cocktails before dinner
champagne during dinner and cordials
afterward.
When asked about his visit to Captain
Fuller's quarters the witness said that he
was Invited there to a poker game after
he had given the dinner at the club. He
denied that his conduct at the club had
ben criticized, but acknowledged that
when he reached Captain Fuller's quar
ters he was not sober.

yesterday and was tried by its

owner during the afternoon. It
requires but a slight stretch of the
imagination to see in this powerful ma
chine, with its low frame,' a striking re

character, giving an impression of great
strength. It is a very easy riding vehicle,
the stout springs and big tires taking up
all the jar. â¢ . . .
. Mr. Fair is considered the best amateur
chauffeur in California. For eight years
he has taken a lively interest in these
machines. He has a taste for mechanics,
and knows In an Instant whether the ma
chinery is performing its duty properly.
Mr*. Â¦ Fair has ridden with Â¦ Fournler and
Charron, the most expert chauffeurs in
France, where the use of the machine has
reached its highest development. He has
already outlined a trip to Del Monte when
the roads permit, and is also planning one
to Los Angeles. â¢ - .
â¢The machine is capable of traveling fifty
miles an hour, but there are few stretches
of road here which will permit of this
high rate being maintained for any length

' The machinery which drives the huge
vehicle is all in front, out of the way of
dust. The wheels 'and axles are of great
strength, while the upper, part is as light
as it is safe to make it, some of it being
of aluminum. The motive power is gaso

LISTLESS GAME
Score Fouiteen Runs to One for
the Cripples From Across
the Bay.
In one of the most tiresome and listless
games of the season, Uncle Henry's Ger
mans handed it to the Dudes yesterday
in al4to 1 package. It was one of those
contests that give the national game a
bad name and cause the "fans" to fall
asleep in their seats or else storm the
box office and demand their money back.
The game was utterly without feature,
save some double plays. Levy gave a
poor account of himself in the capacity
of umpire.
The cripples sprung a new one on the
"fans." His name is Water bury and he
halls from Berkeley, but has been pitch
ing for several amateur clubs around the
bey for the last three seasons. This year
he did great work in the box for Peta
luma. 'Â¦: Waterbury is a first rate twirler,
but had the misfortune to make his debut
under harrowing circumstances. In the
lrst place, Levy gave him a bad deal on
balls and strikes. Nordyke made four
hits, but in reality should have been
struck out three times. , Then the sup
port Waterbury received was ragged at
times. Taking everything Into considera
tion, he did well. , -Â¦Â¦Â¦', ,_-
The Germans sent Nordyke home in the
first round on a hit and an error by Bab
bitt. It was during the third Â» that the
big â¢ things bÂ»gan to - happen. Nordyke
should have struck out, but, thanks to
Levy, he got a three-bagger. This un
nerved Waterbury, and Wilson also hit
for three, sending "Dyke" home. By a
combination of swats, and errors five of
the Dutch ambled home.
The fifth round was a sad blow to the
Dudes. A couple of scratch hits and an
error filled the sacks and Waterbury be
came unnerved and gave the next three
their base on balls. . Babbitt â¢ went into
the box,' and Nordyke singled to center,
scoring a pair of : runs. Before the side
was retired Hildebrand brought in an
other by means of a fly to the right gar

Kid Williams of Los Angeles was
knocked out by voting Â«ibb of Cleveland
la3t night in th| main event of a clean
and lively boxing exhibition given by the
Acme Club In the Exposition building,
Oakland. There were two preliminary
bouts, both good as far as they went.
Both were terminated at the signal of a
sponge thrown in the ring. The exhibi
tion was largely attended, the contingent
from this city being out in full force.
Er.ch of the bouts went seve* rounds.
In the main event there waa some live
ly boxing, but Williams was clearly out
classed from the start. Gibb assumed the
aggressive and for the first three rounds
honors were about even. Williams opened
the ba!l in the third round with a left on
the colored boys jaw. which wa? followed
by a brisk interchange of blows. Gtbb
seeming to get the worst of it until to
ward the end of the round, when the gong
found him busily evening up matters,
It was toward the end of the fifth round
that Gibbs superior weight and speed b^>
gan to tell, and from then to the flnhn
Williams repeatedly clinched. The sev
enth round was short. Gibb rapped Wn
liams 1 ribs with telling effect and com
pleted his work with a stiff left hook on
the jaw which sent Williams through the
ropc3 limp and out.
In the txm fight Mickey Welch of the
Reliance Club and Jack McDonald of San
Francisco divided honors until the aev
er.th round, when McDonald's seconds
threw up the sponge. The sponge alao
ended the bor.t between Con Sheehan
late of the British navy, and Hank Grif

fight and Sheehar. was virtually out when
Kid Laviene threw the sponge into tho
ring. Jack Kitchen refereed all the bouts.
POLICE INVESTIGATE RUMOR
OF MURDER LN THE PARK
The police were called upon last night
to investigate a wild rumor to the effect
that a murder or attempt to commit mur
der occurred near Strawberry Hill in Gol
den Gate Park. The rumor, it 19 said,
grew out of a conversation between two
men on a Turk-street car which was over
heard by a boy named Guito Ghetaldl.
The boy is reported to have stated that
he heard one of the men declare that he
had been decoyed out to Strawberry Hill
and shot. Guito reported that the man
in making the statement about having
been shot held his hand over his breaac
as though wounded.
A conductor to whim the story was
told informed Officers Gleason anÂ«l Burke
holder, who. after making in'iu
to the conclusion that the rumor was
groundless. A second rumor was to the
effect that a man had been enticed out to
Strawberry Hill and murdered. Both ru
mors, in all probability, originated from
the same source.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â The strength in to
day' broad and animated market was the se
quence of the sudden awakening of a specu
lative activity yesterday afternoon. A large
bear account was caught uncovered, as a con
sequence of the persistent short selling by
the professional clement for some time on the
assumption that the money market could not
escape a squeeze between now and the first
of the year. The unexpected collapse In the
loreign exchange market and the prospect of
recuperation for the money market left the
bears without much ground to stand on, and
they bought eagerly to cover to-day. This
was a considerable influence in the recovery
of prices. The clearing up of the money sit
uation leaves the way open for the natural
operations of various forces making toward
1 igher prices. The character of to-day's mar
ket made it appear that a. considerable specu
lative element has been waiting and eagerly
en the watch for just this development. The
demand for some of the favorite stocks was
en a very heavy scale and the day's trans
actions were run up once more to over a mil
lion shares. The considerable advance during
the day invited profit-taking in the final deal-
Ings and last prices on the principal active
stocks were between 1 and 2 points lower than
the best. The late selling was accentuated by
a renewal of the acute weakness in People's
Gas oa the denial of a restraining order
against the assessment of taxes on the alleged
high valuations of Illinois corporations. The
stock tumbled 2\ from the best, and Consoli
dated Gas slumped 4%. The aggressive
etrength of New York Central and Manhattan
continued a widely diffusive influence in the
whole market. No information was forthcom
ing to explain these movements. There were
rumors of control of Manhattan by New York
Central and of a coming distribution of the
surplus in the treasuries of New York Cen
tral's subsidiary companies. The determined
buying of Pennsylvania and the. aggreslve Lid
ding up of P.. C. C, and St. Louis were based
entirely on a purpose to rectify the dispro
portion in the prices of these stocks, com
pared with the Vandcrbllts. The placing of
Hocking Valley on a regular 3 per cent, divi
dend basis was an earnest of the prosperous
conditions ruling in the soft coal trade, which
was reflected In the advance of practically that
whole group of etock's. The October statement
of the net earnings of New Jersey Central.
showing an increase of no less than 165 per
cent over those of October of last year, was
ample .^nation of the recent strength in
the anthracite coalers. The collapse in the
loreiÃTi exchange market was due to the sud
den falling off in the demand to cover matur
ities, which had been a feature of the mar
ket for several weeks-.
The railroad bond market was quiet. Total
â¢ales, $2,870,000. . ' Â¦ .

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. -22.-R. G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
Never before in the history of the United
States was there such good reason for a day
of national thanksgiving. This country hus
made unprecendented strides toward a position
of international supremacy, not only in com
merce, but also In finance. To a marked de
gree business enterprises have proved success
ful. An idle wheel In mills or factories is the
exception, while labor is well employed at high
wages. Consumptive demands sustains the
values of all staple commodities. Transporta
tion facilities have been unable to keep steps
with the nation's prosperity, many complain
ing of tardy deliveries.
Strength Is the rule In markets for farm
products. Favorable weather during closing
days of corn harvesting failed to bring any
reaction from the highest Ujfcce level in many
years.
Wheat holds at about three cents above last
years price, despite the marked difference In
size of crops. Receipts for the week were
5,040,417 bushels, against 2,606,776 bushels last
year. Speculation In coffee has resumed nor
mal proportions.
Failures for the week numbered 218 In the
United States, against 238 last year, and 81 in
Canada against 29 last year.
Bradstreet'.s on Trade
NEW YORK. Nov. 22.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: Taken as a whole, the reorder
demand for Jobbers the country over and the
Inquiry for holiday goods is equal to. and In
the latter case, superior to recently preceding
years. While complaints of insufficient trans
portation facilities come from all leading
American, Canadian and even some Mexican
points, the chief tension is noted in that part
of the cÃmtry betwen the Allegheny Mountains
and the Mississippi, and between the lakes
and the Ohio River. While it is expected that
the close of lake navigation will relieve the
tension and release some cars, little permanent
improvement Is looked for until after Janu
ary 1.
The iron and steel market has burst Its
bounds this week no far as prices are con
cerned, and pie Iron is 50 cents to $1 a ton
higher at nearly all markets. The former ad
vance Is on Southern grades, and the latter Is
secured for prompt delivery of much-needed
supplies. Steel works In the Pittsburg district,
are, however, reported as being unable to run
to their full capacity, owing to the lack of
supplies of pig iron, and the furnaces pro
ducing this latter are in turn suffering for
want of coke. Chicago rail mills, which pro
duce one-third of the country's output, are
sold one year ahead, and trie Providence loco
motive works are likewise booked toward the
end of 1902. Many furnaces are out of blast
at Pittsburg and $1 advance is demanded for
prompt deliveries of Bessemer. Some German
steel has reached that center and larger im
ports are expected. Steel billets are scarce
at $GS per ton. Finished products are with
out much change, but Central Western mills
will not promise deliveries of steel bars inside
of sixty days, while structural material is hard
to get. Wheat weakened early on the record
breaking increase in the visible supplies re
ported in the Bradstreet statement. Northwtst
ern receipts were also very neavy, but a good
export demand is reported at the decline. The
Southwestern drouth is reported broken.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week
aggregate 5,515,930 bushels, against 4,983,734
bushels last week and 3, 527, 296 bushels in tins
week last year. Wheat exports from July 1
to date aggregate 122,701,581 bushels, against
74.245,113 bushels last week.
Eastern shoe factories are busy on orders,
and the call for spring stocks is so urgent that
there !s less than the usual between seasons'
quietness. There Is a rather easier tone to
hides which favors buyers.
Failures in the United States for the week
aggregate 223, as against 213 last week, 21a
in this week a year ago. 202 in 1599 and IS2
in ISSB.
Canadian failures for the week unmber 22.
against 30 last yeek and 31 in this week a year
ago.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 22.â The wheat market was
a dull, narrow affair, ruling most of the time
slightly under yesterday. The opening was
easier on Improved weather conditions in the
winter wheat belt as the result of copious
rains. Lower cables and continued liberal re
ceipts also had a depressing influence and
December, which opened %@%c to %@%c lower
at 71%@71%c, declined soon to 71%@71%c. There
were good orders on the break, many from
Wall street, and shorts had to cover, bringing
December up to 72% c. After this demand was
supplied the market steadied and December
closed unchanged at 72!5?2%c.
Trade In the corn pit was governed mainly
by local conditions. December closed firm at
60% c.
A stronc cash situation in oats kept that
pit fairly active with a strong undertone. De

Provisions ruled easy early on a large run

able.
Chicago opened tamely on indifferent cables
and large Northwestern receipts, but subse
quently recovered on good buying by houses
with Wall street connections. Speculative
trade was smaller, owing to another heavy in
crease in the visible supply expected next Mon
day. The Modern Miller was very bullish
and said that it was expected that from 45,
00,000 bushels to 50.000.0U0 bushels would be
fed to stock this season. It also said that
complaints of dry weather were Increasing,
and some reports were that fall sown Wheat
is dying In some sections on account of lack
of moisture, though the late rains may have
afforded some relief. The American clearances
for the week, according to Bradstreet's, were
5.515.000 bushels, including flour.
The local market showed little change,
though prices were a fraction lower.

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there have been five coal
deliveries from Washington, 19,220 tons; one
from LSittish Columbia, ".':k;U tons; one from Au
stralia, 3184 tons; one tram Swansea, 3000 tons
one from Oregon. 6KO tons; total, 28,364 tons. As
this is about equal to the average weekly quan
tity c-nr.sumed, the stocks now in yard will not
be disturbed. There Is a lively demand for do
mestic fuel occasioned by our late rainstorms,
which is keeping the coal teams in constant mo
tion. Prices remain stationary for steam
grades, which are in full supply and which can
not be advanced with oil as a competitor but
household coals command extreme rates, on ac
count of the winter demands and the light
stocks here. Freight rates for coals from Aus
tralia are declining, hence Colonial grades' are
quoted lower, but Cardiff and Swansea coals
have been advanced at points of shipment
readers could be induced to believe the wild
vagaries which are being dally chronicled in re
gard to the yearly output of fuel Oil they must
be characterized as gullible. Figures are scat
tered around indiscriminately, as though they
represented no values and the lives or prod
ucts of wells in Fresno and Kern counties were
like century plants. The products or Â»ome wells
are materially diminishing, and not yet over
three years old. That enough Is being pumped
to prove a lasting menace to the sale of coal
is already an established fact."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 22.â Captain A. W.
Hall, who is weil known among Sar.
Francisco seafaring n:;n, arrived to-day
on the British ship Pass of Melfort, and
will proceed immediately to Washington
D. C, where he wi!! ask the State De
partment to demand heavy damages from
Mexico. Captain Hall's- story of indig
nities received at the hands of Mexican
officials is one of thrilling interest.
Captain Hall was formerly master of
the San Francisco schooner Sadie. Early
in the year he sailed away from San
Francisco with a new among which
was a man who asptr'.ed that he knew
the location cf valuable pearl fisheries in
the Gulf of California. The schooner
made her way to the headwaters of the
g-ulf with Â¦ ' and with every one
eagoriy looking forward tc the profit that
was to follow the vemjie.
On reaching the site of the alleged pearl
beds, Captain Hall found it would be
necessar\ to engage natives to do the
diving fcr him. :tnd accordingly proceeded
to a small settlement near the grulf. Tea
Mexicans were anything but friendly to
the visitors, and one night the entire
party was driven av.iy and the vessel
confiscated. Captain Hall and several of
the crew were thrown into a dungeon.
After two months' incarceration without
the privili-ge of communicating with his
friends in the States. Captain Hall suc

For more than 200 miles in that wild

ally arriving at Santa Rosalia. He took
refuge on the British .-hip Falklandbank
The Mexican officials earned of his pres
ence and announced thc-ir intention of
taking him from tho vessel. The sailors
on the Falklamlbank were true blue,
however, and carried aboard information
of the projected raid. The Pass of Mel
fort was in the stream ifady for sea, an.l
during the night Captain Hall was trans

voyage tc this port.
Captain Hall is convinced that he ha? a

HUMOR REVIVES
RAIL PROJECT
Oregon Short Line May
Be Extended to San
Francisco.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 22.-The railroad
building in Northern California, present
and prospective, has led to the revival of
the plan to build that section of road
which will close a gap and give Califor
nia another connecting road with the
East. The scheme accomplishes what the
Oregon Midland, proposed but not built,
would have done. The Burlington was
behind the Midland proposition, and it is
believed Eastern railroad interests are
fostering the new plan that is being dis
cussed.
The great increase in lumber and cat
tle traffic is causing branches from the
main line to pu.sh on in several direc
tions. One of the latest projects is for
the extension of the branch from Mon
tague to Yreka. in the western portion of
Siskiyou County. Thomas B. Walker, the
lumber king, is expected to build a long
branch through the eastern Siskiyou tim
ber land.
Simultaneously comes the report of
prospective work that will have more
than local importance, in that it will sup
ply a link for a transcontinental system.
It is probable that one of the several Sis
kiyou County branches being extended to
ward the Oregon boundary in developing
Northern California and Southern Oregon
will form part of a trunk line down the
coast to Eureka, to join the old Donahue
road and reach San Francisco Bay at Ti
buron, while northward a connection will
be made in Eastern Oregon with the Ore
gon Short Line to Utah.
A natural and easy route for crossing
Siskiyou County from Shasta Valley
would be an extension of the Yreka Rail
road to Scott Valley, then over Salmon
Mountain to Salmon River, or down Scott
River to the Klamath, as may be deemed
upon survey to be the most practical way
to cross the level coast valleys direct to
Eureka, to which point the California
Northwestern or Donahue road is now
gradually extending.
A railroad from Eastern Oregon through
Siskiyou County to Eureka on the coast
would make connections for a short and
direct route to all Eastern Oregon, Wash
ington. Idaho, Montana and British Co
lumbia. It would form another' route to
Portland and Seattle and connect with all
the continental roads of the north toward
the Atlantic.
Archbishops Conclude the Session.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.-The annual
meeting of the Archbishops of the United
States, which has been in session at the
Catholic University for several days ad
journed to-day. Archbishop Keane of
Dubuque, secretary of the meeting, an
nounced that to-day's final session was
devoted to a consideration of the internal
affairs of the hierarchy and that the cate
chisms and the Lenten regulations were
the main subjects discussed, but that no
action of any importance was taken.

PARIS, Nov. 22.â The Senate to-day

WANT BERKELEY
TO TEACH MUSIC
Walter Damrosch and
Dr. Wheeler Hope
for New Study.
BERKELEY, Nov. 22.â Dr. Alfred C.
Haddon, the English ethnologist, and Mr.
Walter Damrosch, the composer, spoktf
before the students of the University of
California this morning at the bi-weekly
meeting held in Harmon gymnasium. An
unusually largo crowd was in attendance,
as many visitors took advantage of the
meetin.e: to hear and see the two promi
nent men. President Wheeler presided
and introduced the speakers.
In presenting Mr. Damrosch, President
Wheeler said: "We ou^ht to have more
music here; we ought to have a depart
ment of music in the university."
Mr. Damrosch prefaced his remarks l>f
giving a humorous aescription of t.ho
knowledge California held of the average
New Yorker, who be'leves this State fo
be a place "where the haughty Spanish
don lives in proud seclusion, his daughter
occasionally flirting with an American
cowboy, who is a Hnrvard graduate."
Mr. Damrosch spoke particularly of mu
sic, saying:
"In this country, unfortunately, mu~ic
has been relegated to women alone. Tiie
old feeling that musio is effeminate has
not been overcome, bit I hope the time
will come when it will be studied by
every man as a daily necessity. Every
man should study some instrument â not
only the banjo. As the advance guard of
civilization its 'plunk plunk' is cheerfu'i,
but there are nobler instruments in the
i reach of all. To get perfect rest we
should have a change &f occupation, anri
there is nothing so restful to the lawyer,
the doctor or the merchant after office
hourp as to commune with this great art
of music.
â¢ "You have here a great school of learn
ing, the foundation cf that happiness
which knowledge brings. I hope the day
is not far distant when California will
have a chair of music properly endowed
and this university become a center of
musical study. Why not have the greÂ»t
musicians come here as well as else
where?"
Dr. Haddon also gave an interesting
description of student life at Cambridge,
1 England.
DEATH'S LIST
MAY INCREASE
TELLURIDE, Colo., Nov. 22.â The work
of recovering- the bodies of the victims
of the disaster in the Smuggler-Union
mine progressed slowly until at 11 o'clock
to-day, sixty hours after the breaking out
of the fire at the mouth of the Bullion
tunnel, the last body was brought to the
surface, it was that of John Nevala and
was found in one of the stopes of tho
seventh level.
The death Hat now numbers twenty
five, the brave engineer who sacrificed
himself in an effort to rescue his com
rades having died this afternoon. He
never regained consciousness after being
taken from the mine, and was only kept
alive so long by the most arduous work
of the physicians in attendance. The re
vised list of dead is as follows:
August Kaauter, Finlander, family
living at Telluride; Charles Mackl, wif.3
living in Telluride; Tborwald Torkelson,
wife in Norway; William Merriweath^r,
wife and family at North Fork; John
Nevala. wife and family in Te'.luridt;
Alik Fillman, wife llvinjj in Telluride; Iva
Sundstrom, wife and family in Silvtr
Plume; Battisto Oberto, Antone Ausei,
John Rassori E!oi Bersago, Joseph Ber
sago, Emil Dahl, James Nelson, John
Able, Matt Stark, Alexander Barkley,
John Peterson, William Jones, William
Graham, Frank Zadra, Mark Zadra, Gus
Sundborg, Allen Herdrickson, Hugh J.
O'Neill.
Except those indicated all were single
men so far as is known. All in the mine
at the time of the fire are now accounted
for, and at noon th.; search for bodies
was practically abandoned. There is yet
a possibility that others may be found
in stopes not yet reached, but this is not
thought probable, for the day shift did
not have time to reach any distant stODet;
before the alarm of fire was given.
The exploration of the ninth level was
completed to-day, but no bodies were
found. The workings are not yet suffi
ciently free from eas to make it entirely
safe to explore all parts of them.
The responsibility for the disaster has
not yet been fixed and no one at Tellu
ride is being blamed. The Coroner has
held an inquest over the bodies at the
Morgue and several of them have been
sent to relatives in various parts of the
State. The citizens to-day completed ar
rangements to bury the others with hon
ors to-morrow afternoon. All places of
business will close at the request of the
Mayor. The services will be held in the
theater and all the ministers of the city
will take part.
It is said that the company will close
its mine for about thirty days, during
which time the workings which were
damaged to the extent of more than
J50.000 will be repaired and will then re
open with a force of between 700 and 1000
men.

As a token of esteem and regard for her
efforts as the moving spirit in the parlor's
organization. Mrs. Julia W. Downey has
been selected as the floor directress and
leader of the ball. It was mainly through
her energy that the Verona Parlor was
forrred last summer. Not only were the
requisite thirty charter members secured,
DISPUTE GOES
TO ARBITRATORS
Trouble Among Great
Fair People to Be
Adjusted.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 22.-A final effort was
made to-day to adjust the dispute be
tween the World's Fair National Commis
eion and the Louisiana Purchase Exposi
tion Company as to which body should
have authority over foreign exhibitors,
but without result, and the matter will
now" go to arbitrators under the act of
Congress providing for the commission.
The board of arbitration will consist of
two members of the National Commission
and a like number from the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition Company. Should
they fail to come to an agreement a fifth
arbitrator will be appointed by the Secre
tary of the Treasury.
Rules and regulations adopted by the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition Compaiiy
for the government of exhibitors had been
presented to the National Commission for
ratification. The National Commission
made some amendments which the local
company refused to accede to and thus
the matter stands. At the meeting of the
National Commission a statement was
authorized. It is in part as follows:
The mattgr in dispute between the Exposition
Company and the National Commission grows
out of a difference of opinion as to the con
struction of the act of Congress under which
thle commission was appointed and section 4
of the act. Section 4 provides for a board of
arbitration, to whom^all matters of difference
arising between the commission and company,
concerning the administration, management or
general supervision of the exposition, including
all matters of difference arising out of the
power given by the act to the company or to
the National Commission to modify or approve
any act of the other of the two bodies, shalj
be referred for determination. The decision of
this board shall be final in all matters present
ed to it for consideration and determination,
so the act provides.
The commission, under claim, of authority
drawn from the provisions of the act generally
and especially from the (section quoted, made
a modification of the rules reading as follows:
"Should disagreement arise from the Expo
sitior Company and the representative of any
government, state, territory or district, such
representative shall have the privilege under
such rules of procedure as the National Com
mission may from time to time promulgate of
referring the matter in disagreement between
such representatives and the company to the
National Commission for conslder^lon and ad
justment with the company." f
To this modification the company excepted.
The commission insisted upon the modificatlpn
and hence the subject in disagreement goes to
arbitration under the act.
Ex-Senator John M. Thurston of Ne
braska and ex-Congressman John M. Al
len of Mississippi have been appointed
members of the board of arbitration on
behalf of the National Commission. The
names of the local members have not
yet been made public.
Demand Coin of Kerr.
FRESNO, Nov. 22.â A formal demand
was made of County Recorder James M.
Kerr by the Board of Supervisors this
afternoon for $1000, the remainder of the
shortage of $1300 shown by the Record
er's books. Attorney Welch, acting for
Kerr, said to the board that he had the
$1000 in his possession, but requested an
extension of time to enable him to in
vestigate the law relating to the reten
tion of miners' fees by County Clerks be
fore complying with the board's demand.
He was granted an extension until to
morrow morning.
Money Needed for a Legation.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â There is no
danger that the United States Legation
at Peking will be evicted by the Koreans.
Already the United States Government
possesses a considerable plat of ground
in Peking in the general legation com
pound. This is partly inclosed. The fund
of $40,000 appropriated by Congress for the
acquirement of a permanent legation
building will, be ready by the time our
lease expires on the present quarters.

Jumps From Car and Is Hurt.
OAKLAND, Nov. 22.â Concussion of the
brain and a possible fracture of the skull
resulted to-night to A. Lundgren, a black
smith from Towle, who jumped off a Hay

headway. Lundgren had been visiting
friends at Elmhurst. He thought he
boarded the wrong car and without wait

Lundgren was unconscious when he was
picked up. The Receiving Hospital sur

Death of Grand Army Man.
OAKLAND, Nov. 22.â John G. Millar,

INDIANS NEED
BETTER HOMES
Commissioner Jones Sug
gests Solution of a
Problem.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â A policy
which, it is contended, will settle the en
tire Indian question within a generation,
is announced by Commissioner of Indian
Affairs William Jones in his annual re
port, made public to-day. His plan is to
give the Indian an opportunity for self
support, the same protection of his per
son and property as is given others, throw
him on his own resources and to enforce
on him the realization of the dignity of
labor and the importance of building and
maintaining a home for himself. Jones
says that at the outset the Indian must
have aid and instruction, and necessaries
doubtless will have to be furnished him
until his labor becomes productive. Until
the Indian has become a part of the com
munity in which he lives, day schbols, the
Commissioner says, should be established
at convenient places, where the Indian
may learn enough for ordinary business
transactions.
The key to the whole situation, the
Commissioner suggests, is the home. The
larger and more powerful tribes, he adds,
are located in an arid region, on unpro
ductive reservations, often in a rigorous
climate, where there is no chance to
mafce even a living. In these cases some
thing should be done quickly toward
placing such Indians in a position where
they can support themselves.
Commissioner Jones says the cutting off
of rations from all Indians except those
who are incapacitated from earning sup
port, has had very gratifying results, and
if folowed up, will ultimately lead to the
abolition of the reservation and the ab
sorption of the Indian into our body poli
tic. He makes the statement that the
present Indian educational system, taken
as a whole, is not calculated to produce
the results that were anticipated so hope
fully, and may be added to the obstacles
to independence and self-support, under
which class Jones had placed in
discriminate issue of rations, pe
riodical distribution of large sums
of money and the general leasing
of allotments. In the last thirty-three
years, the report says, over $240,000,000
has been spent on an Indian population
not exceeding 180,000. Notwithstanding
this the Indian is still on his reservation,
being fed; money is still being paid him.
he is still dependent on the Government
for existence, and he is "little, if any,
nearer the goal of independence than he
was thirty years ago, and if the present
policy is continued he could get little if
any nearer in thirty years to come."'

BERNARD CLAIMS
HE IS PENNILESS
Too Poor to Pay Ali
mony for Support of
His Minor Child.
Club Dues and Clothes Are
All Furnished by His
Second Wife.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 22.
Upon the plea that he is absolutely pen
niless, O. A. Bernard, a San Francisco
clubman and society devotee, was purged
to-day of contempt for failing to pay $25
quarterly to Lily M. Bernard, his former
wife, for the support of their minor child.
Judge Ellsworth, before whom the matter
was heard, was forced to issue an order
vacating the citation after listening to the
defendant's story of impecunioaity. though
exrressing his regret that circumstances
willed not otherwise.
It is fourteen years since the Bernard*
were divorced by the Alameda County
courts. Mrs. Bernard secured a decree on
her showing of desertion by the defend
ant. Two months af ter ,the divorce whs
granted the child, who is the instigation
of the present controversy, was born.
Later the mother secured an order of
the court directing that Bernard be com
pelled to pay her $25 every three months
for the support of the child.
Bernard paid the installments of ali
rcony regularly for twelve years, until
April, 1899, when he suddenly refused to
remit any more money and has since
failed to comply with the order of the
court. Mrs. Bernard sued for a citation
in May last, when the payments had
lapted so that the total amount owing
was $250, asking that Bernard be com
pelled to appear in court and give rea
sons for his delinquencies, the document
having been made returnable to-day.
Bernard Files Affidavit.
In answer to the citation Bernard fllerl
an affidavit previous to the taking of testi
mony to-day, in which he says that he had
paid the alimony stipend for twelve years
out of his separate .property up to June,
1597, since which time the property has
become exhausted and he is rendered un
able to comply with the order of the
court. In a previous affidavit Bernard
said that his child, having attained the
ago of 14 years and is hence able to earn
a living, he is entitled to a portion of his
earnings, but that he expressly waives
them in favor of his former wife.
When the case was called this morning
Bernard was not in the courtroom. Judge
Ellsworth inquired for him. and Attorney
McPike informed the court that it was
unnecessary for him to appear. Attorney
Ames, for the plaintiff, however, differed
from Attorney McPike's contentions, and
after a little skirmishing Bernard was
ushered into the courtroom from the li
brary, where he had been in waiting.
Replying to questions from Attorney
McPike. Bernarc said ttat he was abso
lutely penniless â that the only collateral
he had !n the world was the ferry ticket
that wou'd carry him back to San Fran
Cisco, xurnisherl by his second wife.
"Where did you gee the money to buy
the ferry ticket with." asked Attorney
Ames, for Mrs. Bernari.
"My wife gave me tl;_> money."
"Does your wife give you money to bay Â¦
things with?"
"Yes; all I get I receive from her."
"Have you any occi:pa:ion? "
Manages Wife's Affairs.
"I nianage my wife's affairs and ahÂ«
pays all my expenses."
"Pays your dues in the Bohemian
Club?"
"Yes."
"Haven't you a watc'i?"
"No, I haven't any watch or jewelry
of any kind."
"Who pays for your ;neals and carfare
when you are managing your wife's af
fairs?"
"My wife."
"Buys your clothing?"
"Yes; all of it."
"Why don't you pay for the support of
your child?"
"Well. I got tired of doing that: I sup
ported it for twelve years and I don't
see why I should keep on doing so. I
haven't" seen the chiH but once or twicÂ«
since it was born. When I used to call
to see him Mrs. Bernard's people used
to discourage and treat me so coldly that
I didn't go to see him any more. If as
has any love for hlr. father he 3hould
call on him. He's no more to me no*
than any child I see on the street, and
I wouldn't recognize hhn if T sa.w him."
As all of Bernard's answers tended to
show that he is without means of h!Â»
own. Judge Ellsworth admitted when tie
matter was submitted that he could uo
nothing but dismiss the citation, and he so
ordered.

DEFENDS WATER
OF LOBOS CREEK
Schus3ler Appears and
Says Flow Is Not
Impure.
Board of Fublic Works Will
Investigate Its Avail
ability.
The Supervisors* Health and Hospital
Committee recommended yesterday that
the Board of Public Works be directed
to report on the availability of Lobo3
Creek as a source of water supply. The
Board of Health will be requested to
make bacteriological and chemical exam
inations of the water from the creek.
The committee had under consideration
Reed's resolution condemning Lobos
Creek water as contaminated. Chfef En
gineer Schussler appeared before the com
mittee in support of his statement filed
to the effect that the water was not im
pure. Schussler called attention to Pro
fessor Milgard's published statement that
the water was potable. Chairman D'An
cona asked if the watershed from which
the creek is euoplied was a residence dis
trict and Schussler replied that it was In
the Richmond district, which had a sewei
system leading out to the sea. Schussler
said he would be willing to buy such a
district as a water source if the quality
of water was as good as that of the I>o
bos Creek water.
E. P. E. Troy, a resident of the district
named, submitted samples of the water
drawn from the pipes at his home. One
of the samples was thick with mud.
Schussler agreed to file a map of the
district supplied from Lobos Creek, and
the Board of Health will report the per
centage of continuous fevers since No
vember 1. the date when the water was
first used, as compared with previous
periods.
City Chemist Green filed a report of the
analyses of two samples taken from the
tank and the dam, but declined to inter
pret his findings until further analyses
had been made. A meeting of the com
mittee will be held in two weeks to re
ceive the reports and to hear Supervisor
Reed in rebuttal of Schussler's statement
to the board.

ALIMONY CASE
PUZZLES COURT
Judge Hunt Takes Time
to Study Point
Raised.
Judge Hunt refused to make an order
yesterday allowing Mrs. L. A Shadbourne
alimony, pendente lite, until it had been
determined whether or not she was really
the wife of Shadbourne. Shadbourne Is
suing for an annulment of marriage, al
leging in his complaint that when he mar
ried the defendant In 1899 she was the
wife of T. G. Carpenter. Mrs. Shadbourne
in her answer denied the allegation,
claiming that the purported marriage be
tween herself and Carpenter was a con
tract affair. She further claims that she
never was the wife of Carpenter, because
at the time the contract oÂ£ marriage waÂ»
made Carpenter had a wife living, an*
that he was not divorced from this wife
until June, 1898, four years after the de
fendant in the case at bar had contracted
to live with him as his wife.
Walter J. Hamilton, who appeared, be
fore Judge Sea well yesterday on an or
der to show cause why he should not bo
puniFhed for contempt for failure to pajÂ»
Grace Hamilton, his former wife, 110 per
month alimony, satisfied the court that
his failure to comply with the order of
the court was due to the fact that he
did not have the money. He gave his
wife, who was present in court, J5, all the
money he had, and promised that in the
future he would do better.
Judge Seawell also considered <he ap
plication for alimony of Jennie M. Klap
perich. who is being sued for divorce by
John J. Klapperich. The application was
supported by affidavits. A decision will
be rendered to-day.
Dennis V. Toboai did not appear before
Judge Seawell yesterday to give any rea
son for his failure to pay alimony, as or
dered by the court. He was notified that
if he did not appear Monday he would
be punished for contempt.
William F. Osborne was granted a di
vorce from Agnes Osborne yesterday Os
borne was married to the woman . from
whom he was freed yesterday at Grand
Rapids, Mich. They lived happily, Os
borne said yesterday, until his wife took
to Christian Science. He said his wife
left him in 1899 and went East, and has
eince, though frequently asked to do bo
refused to return to him.
Decrees of divorce were also granted

WITHOUT ORDER
Consul General Dickin
son Puzzles State
Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â Consul
General Dickinson has mystified the State
Department by his departure from Sofia.
Bulgaria, to Constantinople. He notified
Secretary Hay of his departure from the
capital of Bulgaria, but failed to give a
reason for this move.
The effect of his return to Constantino
ple is to leave the United States without
official representation in Sofia and the
result will probably be to delay the liber
ation of Miss Stone. The authorities are
hopeful that the missionaries in Bulgaria
who have been acting as intermediaries
with the brigands holding Miss Stone
captive will not relax their efforts to se
cure her release.
Dickinson has incurred considerable
criticism by his departure from Sofia at
this moment. No orders have been given
him to return, as the department says his
move may be due to the belief of the
Consul that he can be of more service in
Constantinople. As Secretary Eddy of
the American legation has, however, been
ably handling the case at Constantinople
it is said that Dickinson can do nothing:
at the Turkish caolMl.
SOFIA, Nov. 22.-Â«bnsul General Dick
inson, the diplomatic agent here of the
United States, started to-day for Constan
tinople, there to confer with Spencer
Eddy, secretary of the United States lega
tion, as to the best means of hastening a
solution In the deadlock which has arisen
in the negotiations over the release of
Miss Stone.
Dickinson will probably return here
bringing with him cash with which to pay
Mm Stone's ransom, as her kidnaper's
insist that this payment shall be made
In Turkish gold. The Consul General is
considering the advisability of present
ing an ultimatum to the brigands in
which he will fix ten days as the period
within which Â£10.000 must be accepted by
the brigands as Miss Stone's ransom. If
this proposal is not accepted by her cap
tors all deaJings with the bandfits, so lar
as the United States is concerned will
cease.
If these conditions have not already
been dictated by Dickinson, the ultima
tum comprising them will almost certain
ly be delivered as soon as the American
diplomatic agent returns from Constanti
nople.
According to information here, both
Miss Stone and Madame Tsilka continue
in good health. They are concealed In a
large village near Dubnitza, whither they
were taken blindfolded, and where only
rude comforts are obtainable. A later re
port, however, according to the statement
of a person who arrived from Dubnitza
last night, is that the captives have been
removed from a village near Dubnitza to a
point near the frontier, and that Miss
Stone eot wet while crossing the river

Austrian Parliament Is Divided.
VIENNA, Nov. 22.â Addressing a con
ference of Austrian party leaders to-day,
Dr. Kooeber, the Premier, declared it im
perative to have a workable Parliament.
He appealed to the different parties not to
drag the Reichsrath in the dust. "A
speedy passage of the budget is a consti
tutional and a national necessity " said
the Premier, "and the position of no
party could be prejudiced by co-opera
tion for that end. Unless this end is at
tained a fresh appeal to the constitu
encies will become inevitable." Some of
the leaders promised to assist the Gov
ernment, but the Czechs appear to remain
obdurate, and without their assistance a
Government majority is impossible
Teamster Struck by a Car.
Philip Reilley, a teamster living at 575
Eighth street, was injured last night at
the corner of Steuart and Mission streets
it 1b supposed, by an electric car. He was
found wandering around the street with
a deep gash in hie head. He had been
driving a wagon and it is supposed that
he was thrown off In a collision with a
car. He was taken to the Harbor Emer
gency Hospital and later to the Central
Emergency Hospital. His skull was tre
phined and little hope was entertained
for his recovery.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1901.
COLOMBIAN INSURGENTS
ADVANCING ON PANAMA
General Alban, Leader of the Federal Forces, Is Re
ported to Have Been Defeated With Heavy
Loss in Battle at Chorrera.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
COLON, Colombia, Nov. 22.âRevolu
tionists are in control along the
Panama Railroad up to within two
miles of Panama. An attack on
the troops of that city is Immi
nent, for General Domingo Diaz is now
at Empire station, which is thirteen miles
from Panama, with a force of 1100 revolu
tionists.
Panama is awaiting important develop
ments. Residents are anxious, but quiet
still prevails in the port, in spite of the
strong undercurrent of feeling.
Whether General Alban's troops have
been seriously repulsed by the intrenched
insurgents at Chorrera is not definitely
known, though reports reached here that
a part of Alban's force which had gone
to Chorrera by sea had been surprised by
the rebels soon after landing and had
been badly defeated.
The report was that of 900 men General
Alban saved only a remnant, including
twenty-seven officers, and that the survi
vors sought refuge on Government ves
sels. The other part of Alban's force,
which went overland from Mlraulores, is
Bald to have deserted and joined the in
eurgent army. Later advices modify this
early report, particularly as to General
Alban returning to Panama last evening
on the gunboat Boica with a party of
wounded soldiers and then going back to
Chorrera early this morning to resume
operations against the revolutionary
army.
Sufficient information has come to show
that there has beeen severe fighting at
Chorrera, and that the battle was con
tinued to-day. It is announced by the
insurgents that one of their leaders, Gen
eral Victorlano Lorenzo, with 1500 men, Is
advancing toward Chorrera from Peno
nome, which is about twenty-five miles
away from the former place. General
Herrara, a Liberal chief, reports that
there is another force of insurgents,
about 600 men, near Panama.
Asks for More Marines.
Secretary Arjona, who is in charge of
the Government In Panama during the
absence of General Alban, has requested
Captain Perry of the United States bat
tleship lowa to land marines. He re
ceived a reply from Captain Perry that
the present situation in Panama did not
Justify such proceedings.
Secretary Arjona is working hard to
keep the city in the posseGsion of the
Government. There are many sympa
thizers and supporters oÂ£ the Liberal
cause in Panama. The insurgents say
that the important Pacific coast point
of Buena Ventura is now in their pos
session. The town, it is reported, was
taken by assault. Buena Ventura is
about 400 miles south of Panama,
Colon under the new regime continues
tranquil. The insurgent troops here num
ber more than 400, as many recruits have
been armed with rifles captured from
the Government force.
All of the principal stations along the
Panama Railroad near Colon are being
watched by large revolutionary bands.
The Provisional Government In Colon
has begun to reduce the heavy duties.
The commercial tax has been reduced 10
per cent and other financial measures are
being changed. It is the aim of the Lib
eralists also to strike the salt monopoly.
Dr. Campillo has been appointed Prefect.
Senor Espriella, counsel for the Panama
Railroad, had been selected for the office,
but declined it. Dr. Campillo is now or
ganizing the police force. Senor Silas has
been appointed Mayor.
A cablegram was received yesterday an
nouncing that General Uribe-Uribe will
arrive In Colon on November 28.
The arrival of General Lugo, who has
been with the insurgents at Chorrera, Is
expected here. It was supposed he would
reach Colon to-day.
The United States gunboat Marietta has
not yet arrived at this port.
Trains are running regularly over the
isthmian railway. All stores are open in
Colon.
America's Stand Justified.

RIOTERS RULE
OVER SOLDIERY
Authorities in Athens
Unable to Suppress
Students.
ATHENS, Nov. 22.â The turbulent dem
: onstrations here growing- out of the pro
: posal to translate the gospels into mod-
I crn Greek were continued to-day in the
! streets, especially in front of the Chamber
Â¦ of Deputies and before the university.
, There were many ugly rushes. The mlll
! tary are finding difficulty in controlling
the rioters.
The meeting of the Chamber of Depu
ties to-day was marked by a series of
violent altercations. At noon it was an
' nounced that the Government, to preserve
i order, had prevented the Ministers from
j attending the Chamber of Deputies, but
1 that they would attend to-morrow and
i move a vote of want of confidence. In
| the absence of a quorum the Chamber
Â¦ adjourned.
In the course of the afternoon the grow
ing crowds and the increasing excitement
heralded the hour for the funeral of the
victims of the riot. The bulk of the
troops were confined to the barracks.
; The shops along the route were closed by
police orders.
Burial of the Victims.
At 5 o'clock the cortege left the ca
: thedral for the cemetery, dense crowds
I following. The seven coffins, covered with
white flags, were preceded by students
! carrying a black banner. The procession
j halted for some minutes before the pal
i ace, but no cries were raised. The popu
; lace, going to and returning from the
I cemetery, maintained a silent, restrained
demeanor. At the cemetery M. J_.evedis
delivered an oration, in the course of
which he attacked the Government and
declared that the people ought to erect a
monument over the "victims of duty and
patriotism."
The city resumed its normal aspect as
the evening wore on. The students, how
ever, still remain In occupation of the
university. The rector, at the head of
thirty professors, endeavored to persuade
them to retire, but they declined to com
ply unless given guarantees that no legal
proceedings would be taken against them,
that the translators of the gospel would
be excommunicated and the university
would not be occupied by troops.
Metropolitan Broken-Hearted.
It seems that the resignation of the
Metropolitan of Athens, Procopius Oeco
nimidis, was very dramatic. The Minis
ter of Public Worship, M. Stais, visited
him during the night and told him that
the King and the Government desired
him to resign. At first the Metropolitan
refused. He was then taken to see the
Premier, M. Theokotis, after which all
three went to the palace at 1 o'clock in
the morning. As a result of the interview
with the King the Metropolitan resigned,
weeping and broken-hearted.
M. Theokotis had a narrow escape
when his life was attempted. He dis
played the greatest courage and forbade i
his friends to fire on his assailants. The I
gates at the residence bear marks of |
seven bullets.
Teshara Granted a New Trial.
SANTA CRUZ, Nov. 22.â The Supreme
Court to-day granted Joseph Teshara a
new trial. Teshara was convicted of com
plicity in the murder of G. D. Loucks
nearly three years ago. Yesterday the
Supreme Court refused a new trial to
Manuel Amaya, convicted of the same
crime.
another cablegram from General Arjona,
the acting Governor of Panama, stating
that an immediate attack on that city by
the Liberals is not apprehended and that
all is now quiet in the vicinity.
It is Â¦ the opinion of the Colombian offi
cials here that the Government gunboat
General Pinzon, which left Colon after the
occupation of that town by the Liberals,
has gone to Cartagena for troops .to re
inforce the Government on the isthmus,
and they expect to return very soon with
sufficient force to change the . aspect of
affairs there.
The answer of the Colombian Govern
ment to the representations of Consul
General Gudger, to the effect that the
Government was unable to guarantee the
integrity of Â¦ the railway communication
across the Isthmus, was purposely de
veloped in order to make plain the fact
that the United States was perfectly justi
fied in landing its forces at Colon. With
this formal acknowledgment of the Co
lombian Government of its inability to
maintain communication it becomes, it is
said, not the privilege but the duty of the
United States, under the treaty of , New
Granada, to guarantee that communica
tion, even though the use of force is. nec
essary, It is not intended to interfere be
tween factions, Conservative or Liberal,
unless a faction places itself in the posi
tion of obstructing the purpose of the
United States to keep the Panama Rail
road free to traffic. "
Reyes to Become President.
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 22.â General Os
pina ; late Minister of War of Colombia,
states that in all probability matters will
be arranged whereby General Reyes will
return to accept the Presidency of Colom
bia. General Ospina brings with him a
letter from San Clemente, the legal Presi
dent, now confined by the actual Presi
dent, Marroquin, tendering his resigna
tion. . i
General Reyes last night received a
cablegram from Marroquin saying that he
intended to resign and asking General
Â«eyes to assume the office.
General Garces, who Is here in the in
terest of the revolutionary party, says
n n ral RRese >' es is entirely acceptable to
an but a few of the violent partisans.
.me. me proposition is to place General Reyes
in office, declare a general amnesty and
make up a Cabinet composed of all the
various factions. This, it is believed,
would end the revolution.
Colon May Be Burned.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Advices received
by the Panama Railroad and Steamship
Company from their agents at Colon

Consul General Arturo D. ; Brigard of
Colombia received- a cablegram to-day
from General Charles Alban, Governor of

stated that General Alban , would attack

Officers Make a Good
Catch in Arresting
Frank Moran.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 22. â Frank Moran,
Michael Graz and E. M. Silva were exam
ined on a charge of robbery before Jus
| tice Herzinger to-day and held for trial
; In the Superior Court, with bail at $3000
: each. The men are accused of having
J robbed Harry Conway, a miner, near
! Castella, on the night of October 29. Con-
I way had fed the three men in Baker City,
Or., and had seen them In Dunsmuir. Con-
I way boarded a freight train and went to
! sleep on a pile of ties In a box car. He
! was awakened by a blow on the head, and
found each of the three men he had be
friended covering him with a pistol. They
took his gold watch and other valuables,
but overlooked $100 in coin. While they
I were debating whether to kill Conway be
' fore throwing him off the train he
i crawled to the door of the car and leaped
! out. The train was running slowly and
he was not injured. The robbers fired two
shots at him, but both missed. The three
criminals were caught by Redding officers
; after a hard chase.
Moran's Record in Utah.
OGDEN, Nov. 22.â During the latter port
of October ex-Policeman Fred Meisner
read in a press dispatch rrom California
the account of the robbery of Harry Con-
I way near Redding, Cal. The name of one
of the captured robbers, Frank Moran,
attracted Meisner's attention and he be
gan an investigation that ended in the
I identifying of Moran as one of the most
desperate criminals that has ever been in
Utah. His record here forms an interest-
I ing story.
Frank Sinclair, alias Moran, and a com- |
panion named Frank Hamilton were re
leased from the Utah penitentiary on
i June 22, 1894. They came immediately to
Ogd,en and engaged rooms in the Windsor
Hotel. Early on the morning of January
24, 1894, the two convicts effected an en
trance to the Swan residence in Ogden.
They went into a room on the lower floor
| occupied as a sleeping apartment by Mrs.
I Alexander Swan. When Mrs. Swan
| awoke the burglars told her not to be
i frightened, but to disclose the wherabouta
of jewelry and other valuables and they
would not kill her. Their voices aroused
William Swan, who occupiea an apart
ment on the second floor. He arose to in
| vestlgate and just as he got to the head
of the stairway he saw the robbers stand
ing in the lower doorway. He shot at
them with his revolver and they returned
the fire. In all eight shots were fired, but
none took effect.
Policeman (Jives Battle.
Moran and Hamilton left the residence
and ran to the corner of Twenty-second
street and Adams avenue. Here they met
George Durbrow and demanded his val
uables. They took some money and a
gold watch from him and then went south
on Adams street to Twenty-fifth, where
they encountered Fred Meisner, who was
! then a policeman and was just going
heme. They demanded his money, but
instead of complying Meisner sprang be
hind a post and they commenced shoot
ing. They fired four or five shots, one of
which entered Meisner's right ankle and
another grazed his neck. Meisner fired
two shots at the thieves and the two ran
south on Adams street, followed by Meis
ner, who was soon obliged to cease the
pursuit on account of his wound.
Police Captain Brown, who was going
to his home on Twenty-sixth street,
heard the shots and saw the men run
ning down Adams street. He followed
them and captured Hamilton in an out
building on Twenty-seventh street On
his way back he saw Moran standing on

COLONY SCHEME
TO BE REVIVED
Topolobampo Co-opera
tive Concern Talked
of Again.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 22.â The Topolo
bampo Co-operative Colony scheme Is to
spring to life once more. Henry Prem
bert, a member of the original colony, and
who still resides at Topolobampo, Mexico,
was here to-day on his way to New York
to consult with Colonel A. K. Owen, the
promoter of the scheme.
It is stated that since the building of
the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Rail
road to Topolobampo is assured, English
capitalists have become interested in
Colonel Owens' scheme and that the old
debts of the colony are to be removed and
an effort will be made to obtain from the
Mexican Government a renewal of the
valuable concession which the colony at
one time held for extensive lands and port
facilities at Topolobampo. The Topolo
bampo co-operative colony was started
about fifteen years ago. It was to be con
ducted on the Bellamy plan. Several hun
dred colonists endured great privation,
and almost starvation, before they could
make their way back to their ojd homes
in the United States. A few of*the colo
nists held off and are hopeful of the pres
ent plans of the revival of the scheme be
ing successfully carried out.
TWO OLD MEN VICTIMS
OF LOVE FOR UQTJOjR
Drink Wood Alcohol by Mistake and
Are Found Dead in a
Cabin.
SALINAS, Nov. 22.â John Howland.
aged 77 years, and Samuel Ratcliffe. aged
6 years, pioneer residents of the Sur
country, were found dead in the former' s
cabin on the Little Sur yesterday. An in
vestigation instituted to learn the cause
of their demise brought out the fact that
it was due to love for alcoholic stimulants
and failure to discrimnate between good
liquor and plain "firewater." A jug of
wood alcohol, half empty, was found near
the outstretched bodies. Evidently the
two old men had drunk copiously of the
poisonous fluid. They had been dead a
week before their bodies were found.
Find No Proof of Crime.
SANTA ANA, Nov. 22.â District Attor
ney Williams, Coroner Clark and the
Deputy Sheriffs who went to Capistrano
yesterday to investigate the report that
a boy had been beaten to death, returned
this morning. The body was exhumed and
an inquest held. No bones were found to
be broken and aa the body was decom
posed no evidence against the person sus
pected was obtained and the Coroner
rendered a verdict of death by natural
causes.
Reward for Murderer's Capture.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 22.â The County
Court to-day offered a reward of $500 for
the arrest and conviction of the murder
er of James B. Morrow, the young man
who was found dead on the sidewalk near
his home yesterday morning. No arrests
have yet been made.
the corner of Twenty-sixth street and
Adams avenue, but Moran managed to
escape for a time. He was afterward lo
cated in a room at the Windsor, but ran
out in the railroad yards, where he was
captured by Conductor "Jack" Leahy* and
turned over to Chief Davenport and other
officers.
The two men were Indicted on February
