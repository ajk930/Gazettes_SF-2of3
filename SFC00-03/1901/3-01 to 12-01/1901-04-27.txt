It will come to pass
that for six day's In
the month of May San
Francisco will be the
S " ' ' " real capital of the na
tion. And out on the corner of J^aguna
and Clay streets, with its windows over
looking half the city and Its doorway
opening on to the lawns of Lafayette
square. Is the home of Henry T. Scott,
which for the same six days will be the
seat of government.
The house is- a comparatively new one,
furnished with all that wealth can pro
cur* and taste suggest, and its place on
the southern slope of the hill gives it a
view almost unsurpassed. It is com
fortable and homelike, as well as spa
cious and richly finished, and while he
remains its occupant It will be absolutely
the President's home. He will brins his
own attendants there in addition to the
servants of the house, and he may enter
tain as he pleases or live in the strictest
privacy, as the fancy suits him. The
house will be equipped with all means of
communication necessary for the prompt
and effective transmission and transac
tion of business, and one of the rooms
will be fitted up as an office, where the
affairs of the country will be considered
and adjusted.
The owner of the house Is at present in
Burllngame, where he has gone to spend
the summer. When the visit cf the Pres
ident was first spoken of It was a prob
lem often discussed where he should be
lodjrcd. It was known that Mrs. McKln
)ey was in poor health, and that what
more than anything else the President
xvished fcr was a place where he could
retire after the tedious round of public
receptions and functions of various kinds
end be at home with his family and his
*â¢( rk. Such cecluslon" could hardly be se
cured in a hotel, and the problem of find
ing a private houte fitted and furnished
to suit the distinguished guest was al
most a hopeless one until Mr. Scott of
ftred his own residence. He is person
ally known to the President, and so the
offer came as well from a friend as from a
Citizen and it was gladly accepted.
A House of History.
Tt Is not often that a private residence
thousands cf miles from the seat of gov
ernment becomes for a time the veritable
White House of the country, but such an
honor is in store for the Scott home. It
will Insure it a place in local history, and
perhaps some turn or twist of interna
tional affairs presenting itself while the
Prt sident is on his Western tour will
identify the home and this city dircetly
vith some phase of the history of the
world.
The stop In San Francisco being the
longest on the trip, it is more than prob
able that the President will do very little
business until he arrives here. No stop
on the way westward will be long enough
for the consideration of any questions of
public Importance, and so most of the
buEinc-rs requiring his personal consider
stion will be sent on to this city to await
Ills arrival here.
This morning the executive committee
â¢will meet in the office of Irvine M. Scott,
its chairman, and at that meeting it is
probable that the programme of entertain
ment to be carried out during the six days
of the President's slay in San Francisco
win be definitely settled. The outline has
already been decided upon, but there are
various details that have been changed
find shifted from day to day and hour to
hour, for it Is frequently a matter of
even minutes in the carrying out of the
programme.
In the south Santa Barbara is working
hard to cci at least half an hour more to
the four hours and a cuarter which the
schedule allows her, and it is not likely
that she'will get it. In Riverside the peo
ple are working tooth and nail to have the
Presidential train slip down to that town
on its way from Redlands to Los Angeles
and the only way possible to do it will be
to cut an hour from the time at Redlands,
leaving there at 11 Instead of 12, and an
other hour from Los Angeles, arriving
there at half-past 3 Instead of half-past Â£.
Both Redlands and Los Angeles are ob
jecting strongly to losing any of the pre
cious minutes allowed them and it does
cot eeem probable that the President will
eee Riverside.
Santa Clara's Minutes.
And in Santa Clara a wall is going up
from the entire population and it is given
voice at columns' lengths In the local
press demanding that a stop of at least
ten minutes be made in that town. It is
arranged that the President shall be
driven through Santa Clara, but when it
was found that he would not stop there
was trouble. The amount of correspond
ence that has passed between the Santa
Clara authorities and the management of
the Presidential visit to San Jose would
fill a book and the amount of talk it
caused would startle a phonograph; but all
it accomplished was the concession of a
walk instead of a slow trot. The carriage
bearing the President will slow down to a
walk when it reaches the principal street
of Santa Clara and at that pace it will
pass along for several blocks, but there
will be no stop. That is all Santa Clara
could cct. but s he is still demanding a
ten minutes' stop of that carriage.
And it is the same in San Francisco.
There are so many societies seeking to
entertain the President that a schedule
which considers minutes and which can
sandwich a reception in between a launch
end & trip on the bay and a couple of

canal treaty to replace the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty. In other words, it is awarp
of the wishes of most of the Senators and
the only problem before the State Depart
ment is to frame a treaty :that will reflect
their views, insuring a two-thirds vote for
ratification and yet shall "be acceptable
to the British Government. If, as reported
from London, the sine qua non is on a neu
trality clause, officials here feel that suc
cess on this point seems within reach. It
is expected that two drafts of the treaty
will be framed before long, probably the
latter part of June, on Mr. Hay's return
from the West. If Is hardly expected,
however, that final results will be attained
before next autumn, after the return of
Lord Pauncefote from London.
LONDON, April 26.-No definite decision
has yet been reached by the. Foreign
Office" here regarding the probable atti
tude of the United States Senate toward
the projected Nicaragua canal treaty.
The negotiations proceeding on the sub
ject of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty in this
connection are understood to be based on
the sine qua non of the neutrality of the
canal. 4 , â¢ Â»
If this can be definitely assured 1 it now
seems likely Great Britain will agree to
abrogate the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
though there is still the possibility of an
endeavor on the part of Great Britain to
simultaneously bring up the Alaskan
boundary matter. This last contingency is
officially described as being merely a
question of policy, not very likely to be
pursued if the United States is content
to make the canal neutral.

wind from the south three huge prairie
fires are sweeping over Cherry County in
the northwest corner of the State. The
prairie grass is heavy and high through
out the county, and a drenching rain is
all that will save several villages and a
continuous line of ranch dwellings. The

little avail. ,.Â¦-.-.-
A fierce wind prevails over the burning
district and the fire is making tremendous
headway. It is reported at Valentine, the
county seat, that three cowboys with a
herd of cattle perished east of the L.. M.
ranch. The custodians of the herd made
every effort to get their charges beyond
the line of fire, not realizing the pace at
which the flames traveled. When they
-nally lashed their ponies in a race for
life the fire had caught them in a half
circle.
Correspondents from various portions of
Northwest Nebraska describe the glow in

to the conflagration. The blaze started at

Rev. Dr. Robert Mackenzie, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church, in a letter re
ceived ; recently by the session of his
church, announced his determination to
retire from the pulpit* In this letter Rev.
Dr. Mackenzie, who is traveling in Egypt,
said that while he had experienced a great
improvement in health' while abroad, he
did not feel that he would ever recover his
health sufficiently to permit him to re
sume his duties as- pastor of the church.
Hence he asked that his . resignation be
accepted, to take effect on June 1.
Though the session and many members
of the congregation hope that Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie may yet be persuaded to with
draw his resignation, there is expressed in
the letter the venerable minister's deter
mination to never again return to the pul
pit. The church, people find consolation,
however, in the fact that Rev, Dr. Mac
kenzie announces that he will not give up
his duties as professor at the San Anselmo
Seminary and states. that he will continue
his work there upon his return from
abroad.
Rev. William Kent Guthrie, Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie's assistant, will probably suc
ceed him to the pastorate of the church.
Whether this move will follow Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie's resignation none will state,
however. At Rev. Dr. Mackenzie's home
and also at the residence of Rev. Mr.
Guthrie no one would assume competency
to verify either the resignation of Rev
Dr. Mackenzie or the rumor that Rev. Mr.
Guthrie will succeed him, Nevertheless,
both are generally accepted by the con
gregation, as facts.

BESIGNS HIS PASTORATE
MANY sorrowing friends attended
the last sad rites held over the
remains of Theodore. E.. Smith
yesterday. The first services
were held at St. Luke's Episco
pal Church, and the remains were then
taken to the Masonic Temple, where the
impressive Masonic burial service was
read. From the temple the body was tak
en to the Masonic Cemetery, where inter
ment was held.
The funeral services were under the di
rection of Excelsior Lodge No. 6 of the
Masonic order, of which deceased was a
member.
Theodore E. Smith was born in Con
necticut and was 66 years of age when
called by death. For fifty years he resided
In this city and was known far and wide
for his interest In church work and for
charitable deeds.
He entered the employ of- Buckingham
& Hecht thirty years ago, and. was a
valued and trusted employe. He is. sur
vived by a widow and three daughters and
two sons.
The question of naval stations has also
been fruitful of discussion. Secretary
Root has made It clear to the Cubans thai
this Government cannot agree to be re
stricted to a single naval station to be
located In. the bay of NIpe, as is proposed
by the. delegates.
The delegates will not see the President
again except to say farewell to him, but
they will continue to have conferences
,with Secretary of War Root as long as
they remain in the city. r
Marquez Sterling, who is accompanying
the Cuban commissioners, received to-day
from J. M. Govln. publisher of El Muntfo,
in Havana, a cablegram which said:
"Producing interests of our country be
lieve that no political arrangement should
be accepted without prior condition that
next Congress will provide for permanent,
reduction of duties en Cuban products,
naturally without sacrificing dignity and
absolute sovereignty of Cuba."
Question of Naval Stations.
The delegates. were much impressed by
the evidence presented to them at the
President's dinner of the unity of feeling
of public men In the United States as tr.
the relations to be maintained between
this country and their Island. They found
that Democrats as well as Republicans
insisted that the Platt amendment must
be accepted as being best fpr both coun
tries. Some of the public men' who have
talked with the Cubans believe that in the
end they will agree to article 3, trusting
the present administration to put a con
struction upon it that will be acceptable
to them and believing that the precedent
established bv one administration Â¦would
not be overthrown by any subsequent

factory adjustment o'. the differences be
tween the Cuban constitutional convention
and the Government of the United States
will, it is believed, be the outcome of the
negotiations with the delegates now In
Washington.
Secretary of War Root devoted this
afternoon to further conferences with the
Cubans. He entertained them at lunch
con in the Metropolitan Club with As
sistant Secretary of War Sanger, Senators
Spooner and Fornker, Representative
Adams, Generals Miles and Corbin and
Colonel Edwards.
Section 3 of the Plait amendment Is Btill
the principal bone uf contention, and, as
in all of their arguments, the Cubans re
turn invariably to the contention that
that section places Cuba in the absolute
power of the iTnitÂ«d States and allows
lhi6 Government to interfere at all times
and to any extent in the internal affairs
cf the island. This section is even more
distasteful to the Cubans than the re
otrictione placed upor. their treaty-making
or debt-contracting powers.
Delegates Are Much Impressed.
The delegates now propose that the con
stitutional convention shall draw up an
interpretation of section 3 defining just
when and under what circumstances the
United States may exercise the right tg
intervene for the preservation of Cuban
independence. It has been impressed
upon the Cubans that any interpretation
thry may put upon this section must bo

George Wlttum identified Callahan as a
man who passed by his house on the day
before the kidnaping, between 12 and 1
o'clock. He said he and his wife both
watched the man while he traveled 200 or
300 feet, and until he passed out of sight.
After examining thirty-five witnesses
the State rested this evening. The defense
at once moved to dismiss on the ground
that the allegation of robbery had not
been sustained.
The motion was denied.
At the afternoon session Frank Deu
berry. one of the detectives who arrested
Callahan, was called. He met Callahan
on February 11 and Invited him out to
urink. Callahan then toM him to arrest
a man named Charlie Maynard, who
worked in a gambling house at South
Omaha, and young Cudahy would Identify
him as the kidnaper.
Crowe, Munshaw testified, was accom
panied by a woman when he called the
first time* in a buggy and inquired about
the house. '
Detective Savage was recalled. He tes
tified that he talked with Callahan at
Fourteenth alid I>ouglas streets about
threo weeks before he was arrested. Cal
lahan claimed that he was going to work
switching for the Chicago, St. Paul. Min
neapolis and Omaha road on the follow
ing morning. They talked about the kid
naping and Callahan expressed his belief
of Crowe's innocence and said he had
taken Crowe with him to his sister's house
and introduced Crowe to her as Mr. John
son. This Callahan. said was Just after
the Northwestern train robbery, when
Mrs. Kelly was living in Council Bluffs.
Savage testified that later Callahan ad
mitted to the Chief of Police that he had
introduced Crowe to hia sister as Johnson.
He testified that Callahan said he could
not turn up Crowe, and that he would not
if he could. v'v^V:

Munshaw testified that he saw Crowe
there on the day before the kidnaping
and talked with him again, and the latter
said he would move in the next Monday.
Munshaw added that on the night of the
kidnaping the dogs barked late in the
evening and he went out by the well and
saw a buggy or spring wagon drive past
and draw up to the steps of the Schneider
wind house. He was down hill from there
3nd the parites were outlined against the
sky. The" night was dark, but -he could
see the outlines. He saw what he thought
was two men go up the steps and into tne
house, and he thought the parties were
moving in some of their goods.
OMAHA, April 26.â B. K. Munshaw, who
lives near the Melrose Hill house, was
the first witness called this morning on
the trial of James Callahan In the Cudahy
kidnaping case. He identified the picture
of Crowe as that of a man who came to
his house about three weeks before the
kidnaping and wanted to know who owned
the Schneiderwind house. Munshaw said
he told him, and the man came back later
and said he had rented it and paid $1
down and would pay the balance when he
moved in the following Monday.

Returns From the Various Organizations
in the Church Are Prepared for Pres
entation to the General Assembly
PITTSBURG. April 26.â Harmonious ac
tion was taken by the committee on re
vision of the creed of the Presbyterian
church at its session* to-day at the Mo
nongahela House and a unanimous report
formulated late In ine afternoon for sub
mission to the General Assembly which
will meet at Philadelphia, May 16. The
Rev, Dr. Henry Van Dyke of Princeton
University,. when giving the report to the
press representatives, said:
"The action taken cannot be emphasized
too strongly, for if will have to endure
comment â¢ and - criticism In every Presby
terian vhome and community in the United
States. Ten members signed it and we
are assured that every one of the other
four will attach hi3 signature. It was
the full committee that met and* not a
sub-committee. Professor William **â¢
Crabbe of Pittsburg was prevented by 111
nesa from being present. Benjamin Har
rison is dead and that leaves the Rev.
Samuel J. Nlccol of St. Louis and Elders
John M. Har'.an, Assistant Justice of the
United States Supreme Court; John E.
Parsons and Daniel R. Noyes of St. Paul
The report which the committee will
make to- the General Assembly is as fol
lows: ' .
Your committee find on examination of the
returns from the presbyteries the following
That the returns indicate that the church
desires some change in Its creedat .statement.
That the returns indicate that no change is
desired which would in- any way Impair the
integrity of the system of doctrine contained
In the confession of faith.
These returns Indicate that it Is the mind
of the church that the confesston should be
interpreted throughout In harmony with the
teaching of Scripture that God is not â¢wining
that any on<s should perish, nor is it the decree
of God but the wickedness of their own hearts
which shuts some men out from thÂ» salvation
freely and lovingly offered In Christ Jesus to
all sinners.
These returns indicate that a plurality of the
presbyteries desired that changes should be
made by some new statement of present doc
trines.
The returns also Indicate a desire upon tha
part of many presbyteries for some revision
of the present confession, especially In chapter
3. chapter 10, section 3; chapter W, section 7;
chapter 22, section S: chapter 23, section 4.
with additional statement concerning the leva
of God for all men, and for all missions. In
view of these facts we recommend that a com
mission as provided by the form of govern
ment, chapter 23. section 3, be appointed by
this assembly. We recommend that this com
mittee be Instructed to prepare a brief sum
mary of the reformer! faith, bearing the same
relation to the confession which the shorter
catechism bears to the larger catechism and
formed upon the general model of the consen
sus creed prepared for the assembly of 1892.
or the "Articles of Faith'* of the Presbyterian
church of England, both of which documents
are appended to the committee's report and
submitted to the assembly, to be referred to
the committee that may be appointed.
. ThU summary U not to be a substitute for
the confession and Is not to affect the terms
of subscription, but "to. vindicate and clear
the doctrines of the church from all false as
persions and misconceptions." to give a better
understanding of what is surely believed
amonjc us, and Is In no sense to Impair but
Is rather to manifest and maintain the in
tegrity of the reformed faith.
\Ve further recommend that this committee
be instructed to prepare amendments of chap
ter 3 ehapter 11. section 3, and chapter IS.
section 7; chapter 22. section 3. and chapter 20.
section 6 of our confession of faith, either by
modification of the tÂ«st or by declaratory
statement, so as more clearly to express the
mind of the church with additional state
ments concerning the love of God for all men,
missions and the Holy Spirit: It being under
stood that the revision shall in no way Im
pair the Integrity of the system of doctrines
net forth In our confession and taught in the
Holy Scripture. v

Boxers Eaid Villages.
LONDON. April 27.â The Reuter Tele
praph Company lias received the follow
ing dispatch from Peking, dated yester
day: A band of Boxers estimated at 1000
is operating- twenty miles south of Pao-
Tingf u. It has raided three villages with
ing a week and threatens to massacre the
Christians in that vicinity, many of whom
have fled to Paotingfu for refuge.
In the Manchenff district, northeast of
Faotingfu, another strong band Is com
mitting depredations and has announced
its intention to attack the city of Man
cheng. where there is a post of twenty
German soldiers.
Even Paotingfu, since the town was
practically denuded of troops by the ex
pedition to the great wall, is not want
ing in evidences of serious unrest among
the more disorderly elements of the pop
ulation.
Competent observers believe that thft
worst class of Chinese are only waiting
the withdrawal .of the foreign troops to
resume the campaign of extermination
against native Christians.
The Eoxcrs who are reported active in
these districts are composed of the worst
characters in the province. They prefer
brigandage to honest labor, and they are
reinforced by people rendered desperate
by being driven from their homes, by hav
ing their horses and cattle seized by the
foreign troops and in many cases by be

CAX.L, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, .April 26.â Indirect
comment on the Chinese situation by Min
ister E. H. Conger has strengthened the
conviction of the administration that his
return to Peking would be inadvisable.
Conger has given' expression to statements
which should have been reserved, In the
opinion of the authorities, for the ears of
the President and Secretary of State.. Hia
interviews are believed here to have been
due to his desire to bid for the aid of the
voters of Iowa favorably inclined toward
mission work in the far East. The Min
ister has been : the champion of the ex
treme missionary view, demanding execu
tions and heavy indemnities on the theory
that such demands would prevent a repe
tition of the outrages of last summer. It
has-been left to the administration , to
throw the. weight- of its influence against
indiscriminate slaughter and huge indem
nities, - and its attitude has thus far re
sulted in preventing- Â«an- internal revolu
tion in China and increasing:, the danger
of partition of the empire. i â¢.
The " administration hopes Conger will
get the Governorship. It would surprise
few -persons here to learn that a quiet
hint has been given to Iowa Republicans
that the President wpuld be glad If Con

matic corps. - Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦,,.'Â¦

W. WASHINGTON, April 26.-In order to
escape responsibility the Empress Dow
ager of China has appointed a Board of
National Administration, which will here
after pass upon internal and foreign mat

tion is considered significant, at the same
time it is apparent that the Empress
Dowager will remain in supreme control.
Mr. Squires, Charge d' Affairs in Peking,

President McKinley Directs That
Cherished Heirlooms Be Hsstored
to Marie Custis Lee-
WASHINGTON, April 26.â Senator John
W. Daniel of Virginia several days ago
addressed a letter to President McKinley,
indorsing the application of General
George Washington Custis Lee, submitted
by him In behalf of Miss .Marie Custis
Lee. his sister, for restoration of the relics
of General George Washington, of which
he (General Lee) became owner upon the
death of his mother, who was the wife
of General Robert E. Lee.
President McKinley has written Senator
Daniel a letter setting forth that the
relics were turned over to General Mc-
Dowell, then in command there, by a
servant of the Lee family. The general
sent them to the Patent Office for safe
keeping, whence they were transferred to
their present place of deposit, the Smith
sonian Institution. Says the President:
"All the Government did was to accept
the trust of their custody at a time when
the owner could not protect them and
they were consequently exposed to the
risk of destruction. The need for such
protection having ceased, and the trust
voluntarily assumed having been dis
charged, it will afford me great satisfac
tion to give direction for the restoration
to the present head of a historic family of
these cherished heirlooms of the Father of

LONDON, April 26.-Great Britain is
not relaxing her efforts to â¢ induce the
powers to decrease their pecuniary de
mands on China and substitute for a por
tion of their claims commercial agree
ments. The latest advices from the Brit
ish Minister at Peking do not indicate
any degree of success so far, owing, it is
sad, to opposition on the part of Ger
many, which continues to insist on the
payment in full of the large indemnity
she claims. - Rockhill, the American Spe
cial Commissioner at Peking, and Sir
Ernest Satow, British Minister at Peking
are sad to be working on identical lines
Demands on China.
England Would Decrease Pecuniary
Plan of French Officers to End Hos
tilities in China.
PARIS, April 26.â The Gaulois affirms
that General Bailloud and Colonel Mar
chand, some time ago contemplated an
attempt to seize the Chinese Empress and
court. General Bailloud approached Col
onel Marchand and asked him if he would
undertake a certain enterprise which
would very probably hasten the end ' of
hostilities. The colonel â¢ replied that he
was willing and General Bailloud and
Colonel Marchand drew up a plan, the
execution of which was venturesome but
feasible. The diplomats, however, op
posed the scheme and it fell through.
FOR COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS
WOULD SEIZE THE COTJUT.
The British embassy has been informed
that Sir Robert Hart has cabled to Lon
don that in his opinion China can pay an
Indemnity of $200,000,000. Germany is the
only power which is insisting upon full
payment of her claim and her attitude is
preventing the adoption of the, American
suggestion that the claims be' scaled to
the estimate made bv Sir Robert Hart.
Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister, has
received a dispatch from Li Hung -Chang
suggesting that the powers permit China
to pay the indemnity in installments
rather than Immediately. This would en
able China to deal directly with each of
the powers instead of negotiating a loan
with interest at 5 per cent. This sug
gestion is not acceptable to the officials,
wfio believe that some of .the powers
would desire to occupy territory until the
last- cent of the indemnity had been paid.
who are in Peking. One of the cabinet
at Siangfu is Jung Lu, leader in the re
volt against foreigners last summer, and
is rather lukewarm, in his foreign tenden
cies, and the third is superannuated and
is besides an opium eater. At the same
time they are likely to use their influence
against any progressive recommendations
that may be made by the Chinese repre
sentatives In Peking. Before final action
is taken the Empress Dowager must nec
essarily give her approval so that she is
in a position to avoid responsibility by
placing it urion one of the members of
the board and of punishing him if the
foreign Governments insist upon it.
CLAYTON, N. M.; April 26.â Thomas E.
Ketchum, alias "Black Jack," the notori
ous' outlaw, who had terrorized the people
of the Southwest for the past fifteen years,
was hanged here this afternoon for the
last of .his many crimes and his head
was severed from the body by the rope
as if by a guillotine. - ; The headless trunk
pitched forward toward the spectators and
blood spurted upon those nearest the scaf
fold. ' : -
When Ketchum mounted the platform at
1:17 his face was very pale, but his eyes
swept out over the crowd coldly and bold
ly, as if he had no fear. A' priest stood at
his side as the rope was put around his
neck. The condemned man had consented
to this at the last moment.
Ketchum declined to make a speech be
fore "the noose was put around his .neck.
He merely muttered "Good-by," 1 then said:
"Please dig my grave very deep," and
finally, "All right; hurry up." His legs
trembled but he kept his nerve.
When the body dropped through the
'trap the half-inch rope severed the head
as cleanly as if a knife had cut it. The
head remained in the black sack and
dropped into the pit.
Terrible Scene at Scaffold.
Some men groaned and others turned
away, unable to endure the sight. For a
few seconds the body was allowed to lie
half doubled up on its right side, with the
blood issuing in an intermittent stream
from the severed neck as if the heart kept
on with its mechanical beating. Then,
with cries of consternation, the officers
rushed down from the scaffold and lilted
the body from the ground.
The drop of the body was seven feet,
and the noose was made so that it slipoed
easily. Ketchum was a heavy man and
the weight of the body, with the easy run
ning noose, caused the rope to cut the
head off. Dr. Slack pronounced life ex
tinct in a little over five minutes from
the time the body dropped through the
trap. It is stated that too much of a
drop was given for so heavy a man. Sher
iff Salome Garcia superintended the exe
cution and himself let the trap drop.
Ketchum spent the greater portion of
the morning in reviewing his past life. He
displayed perfect control, frequently re
ferring to his momentarily expected death
in a jocular manner. He cursed the rail
road and express companies and their offi
cers who were instrumental in his con
viction and the people of New Mexico in
general and their laws. He acknowledged
that he planned and led a- gang, in many
robberies accredited to him, including the
robbery of the Southern Pacific at Steens
Pass in 1897, and that on the Colorado and
Southern near Folsom in July, 1898. He
said he knew who killed young Hsrstein
at Liberty, Texas, in 1895, but would give
no names, claiming the guilty parties were
alive. He also said that he knew who
killed A. B. Powers in Tom Green County,
Texas, in 1S96, and that Bud Unshaw,, who
is accused, had no knowledge of that
crime.
. Ketchum declared he was not the orig
inal "Black Jack" and said that outlaw
was still alive and 'en joying his liberty.
The Other "Black Jack."
"There are dozens of men in Southern
Arizona," said Ketchum, who will swear
that I and 'Black Jack' are two different
persons. But he was the cause of my be
coming an 'outlaw. Lee Dow, the officer,
saw 'Black Jack' at the Deer Creek tank
affair and in 1898 he told me that if I was
ever tried, for 'Black Jack's" crimes,-. I
would never get" free, for I looked too
much like him. I thought if I was going
to be hansed for another man's crimes I
might as well have some of my awn. The
real 'Black Jack' got the name because
he was very dark and on the Krie roundup
in Arizona there were two Jacks. They
called him 'Black Jack' to know him
from the other. He held up the Nogales
bank and was in the Wachuca siding af
fair, when the soldiers' money, was
taken." â¢ Â¦
Ketchum said that Frank Herrington,
the conductor who shot him, causing him
to lose his right arm: L. C. Fort, the
Wells-Fafgo. attorney, and W. H. Reno,
"the Colorado and Southern Railroad de
tective, who effected his capture, will be
killed within a vear. -
"I smuggled a letter out of the prison at
Santa Fe," he said, "and those three are
marked men." -
Ketchum was the most noted desperado
of the Southwest. Although he was credit
ed with having taken the lives of some of
his fellow-beings yet he finally pair
the forfeit, with his .own life for an at
tempted train robbery in which nobody
was killed. '
Tight on the Railroad.
This crime was committed near Folsom.
N. M., on August 16, 1899. Single-handed
"Black Jack" held up a -Colorado and
Southern passenger train. He ordered the
engineer and fireman to uncouple the en
gine and leave the train. The conductor
and mail agent opened fire on him, which
he promtly. returned. He received the con
tents of a double-barreled shotgun in his
right arm. but/quickly changing the rifle
to his left shoulder, succeeded in wound
ing both conductor and mail agent. lie
then escaped in the darkness, but was
captured the next day. He was tried for
assault UDon a United States mail agent
and- sentenced to ten years in the peniten
tiary. Then in September, 1900, he was
tried on the more serious charge of as
sault upon a railroad train with intent to
commit a felony. He was also convicted
on this charge and was sentenced to be
hanged in November last. The execution
was stayed until March by an appeal to
the Territorial Supreme Court, which af
firmed-the finding of the lower court. In
Mareh a reprieve was â¢ granted until
April 26. Â¦_ '

have been selected to represent the vari

relays. In order that they may become fa

are expected to cover, and many of them
will remain in the vicinity of their courses
until the day of the race, riding their re

None of the clubs holding try-outs to
morrow will publish the results of the
men's rides, as it Is not desired that the
Other clubs should know how well or how
poorly the men are doing prior to the race.
The teams will, doubtless -be announced
the middle of next week.
-Fred West of the Bay City Wheelmen
defeated George McKinney of the Olym

The retirement of E. A.- Kragness of the
Dolphin Boating Club from active athletic
work owing- to the development of a "bi
cycle heart" has broken the Dolphin junior
barge crew for the present, but a new one
will be organized and will shortly ?o into
practice. It Is not unlikely that . A. W.
Pape, who has done, so much good rowing
for the Dolphins, will stroke : a~se*nior
barge crew., the other members of which
will be George Baker. Captain W. O.
Patch and Stanley Adderley. -The last
named has for several years been a mem;
ber of the Triton Boating Club, but since
that club takes no part in racing and Ad

Al Cummings is fishing on the Beswick
at Klamath Hot Springs.
S Mr. McCormick sent down a nice basket
from Boca.-
In spite of adverse weather conditions
the Fish Commission has been meeting
with" a fair share of success in the col
lection of rainbow trout eggs at its differ
ent stations. Reports from its stations
on the Klamath River are to the effect
that about 800,000 eggs have been secured'
and the run is not yet over.. From their
station on the Truckee River they have
returns of 620,000 eggs. This' is In excess
of 120,000 over the total take at that point
last year. Reports from the egg collect
ing stations at' Lake Tahoe show a little
fh excess of a million. The take of the
lake trout eggs is unlimited. The com
mission opened a hatchery at Wawona
this week and the output will be taken
from Lake Tahoe and distribution will
be confined to the waters of Yosemite and
National Park, as heretofore.
Anglers who -propose going to the Mc-

that fishing is improving. What they

catch some very fine fish.
John McDonald of Boca 'sent down a
fine lot of fish taken from the Truckee
early, in the week. He stated that the
prospects for a good season are very

The freshmen have received a challenge
from the Nevada track team for a. meet
to be held at Reno on May 4, but no ac
tion has been taken upon it. The 'var
sity will meet Washington May 22 on the
local oval. The system of graduate coach
ing and .the four men selected at lasf
night's meeting to look after Stanford's
football interests this fall met with uni
versal approval among the students. It
is felt that the presence of four veterans
will do much to instill the old time en
thusiasm Into the candidates of the 1901
team. Personally the four men cho%en
are among the very brightest gridiron
stars that Stanford has produced.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, , April. 26.â
Steady practice for the last two Â¦weeks
has the cardinal baseball squad in the best
form it has attained this season. The men
with the exception of Catcher Ball are in
good physical condition and should give
a good account of themselves. Ball has
been suffering from a slight touch of
pneumonia -which has kept him out of .the
last few practice 'games, but he will be
seen behind the bat In to-morrow's line up.
The personnel of the team will be the
same as in the last game with Berkeley.
Parker will be in the box and should do
some efficient work. . He is steadier than
ever and fields his position like a veteran.
Murphy at third and Cowden at first are
both putting up a better class of ball
than earlier in the season. .The outfield
also should prove satisfactory. The game
will be -called at Recreation Park at 10:30
to-morrow morning.
BERKELEY, April 26.â California will
hold its third and decisive baseball game
with Stanford Saturday mojning at 10:30
o'clock at 'the Eighth and Harrison street
grounds. The University men have been
practicing well this week and will make
every effort to redeem themselves for the
poor performance in the last game.
There will be several changes in the line
up. Hamlin will go from certter. field to
first base. Gardiner, who formerly played
first, will be retired to the bench. Adams
will take second bag in King's place, who
will also be retired. McKeown will go
from right field to center. Phelan will'
take McKeown'! position at right.
The line up will be as follows:
Stanford. Positions. California.

Cowden First base... Hamlin
Mlsner Second base.... Adams

Hcrrera denies that after seeing Mc-
Govern box en Thursday he decided that
he wanted none of that sort of game.
Frank M. Carliio, his manager, will arrive
frem Bak?rElieM to-day and seek an in
terview v.ith Harris, ("arillo says that if
Harris will bet him J5000 to $3900 on the
r-ide he will accept, McGovern to fight -at
any â¢ocisht. Herrera at 126, eive or take
two pounds, weighing in to take place at
2 o'clock of the day of the fleht.
In nil of ilcGovcrn's previous fights
there has btsn little need of at referee.
Oniy a iilnsle decision cculd have been
rendered, and in most instances the de
cliion vrcs cirse to the first sound of ihe
ecr.g. The 2Â£cGcvcrr.-Gc.ns fight provoked
bostCe coir.rr.ent, but there was nothing
for tiie referee tc do. at its end but pro
claim Terry the winner, even if Gans did
ehev.' a sircn.1: of yelioTr or something
else. A 23-rcund fight between McGovern
end Gnrcncr would be a- novelty in fistic
CTCata. It vrcvAC be no pleasant task for
â¢c refers; if bcth r.cn appeared strong at
the finish. But this is not likely
to htppen. It is not in the make
up cf either r.teGcvern or Gardner to al
low the flshi to eo the full limit. Their
Etylca arc averse to protracted battles.
The p-orpects point to a fast fight, a con-
ElEicpt. fierce pace until one or the other
measures his length upon the floor.
Sam Harris, ilcGovcrn's manager, Is an
B3tutc, shrewd entrepreneur. He knows
the vciue cf Terry McGovern as a moncy
ea.rr.cr and he is also keen enough to
knew that a defeat would mean the loss
of thousands and thousands of dollars.
Harrit." opposition to a local referee Is not
founded on ary belief in their incapability
ov lack cf honesty. He says he does not
k~cw them ct all and he cannot afford to
ttilco any possible chance with his man.
Any referee â¢nriom Harris knowsâ not pcr
ccr.ally, "cut through his work in the ring
â T/iil be acceptable" to him. He says that
he r.-lshcs lo be Euro that the man who
6ctc the f:Â£ht movlns on Tuesday night is
a ir.sn cf e-perlence and known integrity.
There ure three competent local referees
In this city, a'l of whom have the
confidence of the people. They are Phil
Wand, Jack Welch and Jim McDonald.
As i&T as honesty goes not a breath of
â¢suspicion has attached to any of these
men und their capabilities have never been
biiousfet' into Question by these who have
teen them inside the rcj>es. No objection
to a Jocai r.an is expected from the Gard
ner Elde, but opposition wilL in all prob
ability be ferthecming from the McGovern
camp.
When the Twentieth Century Club was
organized In this city it was understood
that Charley White would be its official
referee. A stcrm arose in certain sport
ing circles over this announcement and
the club abandoned White for the time.
There 1b a strong possibility that Charley
White will be chosen Inside the ring next
Tuesday evening when McGovern and
Gs.rCr.er ccine together.
"White has been expected in this city for
the past week and will certainly arrive
within a few days. It is said that hi3
visit to this city Is for the sole purpose
of seeing' the fight; that he comes without
any ether Intention. This may be 60, but
when he arrives White may discover that
he has a. job ahead of him which he will
not refuse.
But one preliminary arrangement re
mains for the final settlement of the â¢Mc-
Govern -Gardner fightâ the selection of the
referee. Who he will be is a mat
ter cf doubt. The Twentieth Century Club,
speaking through its match-maker,
James Kennedy, declares that the referee
will be chosen not later than Sunday, in
order to avoid all complications at the
laat moment.

Mrs. Ralph Hersey, Miss Ogier and Miss
S. C. Haldan receive 3; Miss Florence
Clayton has. a handicap of 5: Miss Grace
Adel and Miss C. E. Sweigert receive 8,
and all others 10.
On Saturday, May 4, at 10 o'clock in the
morning, there will be a tournament, open
to members of any golf club, for women
on the links of the San Rafael Golf Club.
In the afternoon of the same day, be
ginning at 2 o'clock, there will be a tour
nament over eighteen holes, medal play,
from scratch, open to men members, of
any golf club. There will be no entrance
fee, and a large list of entries is expected.
The San Rafael course is a very sporty
and interesting one and Is In excellent
condition at present.
The tournament is being played under
the St. Andrews rules, as amended and
interpreted by the Unlted*Sta.tes Golf As
sociation, with the special rules in force
on the Presidio links. These special rules
particularly relate to balls going Into the
wood on playing to the first or second
hole, striking the telegraph poles or wires
in playing to the second or eighth holes,
hitting on the fly the posts or wires pro
tecting any of the putting greens or lodg
ing in the corral in playing to the ninth
hole. In most of . the above cases the
golfer may drop a ball on the spot where
the stroke was played and play another
stroke without any penalty.
Thirty-two entries in all were received
for the tournament, twenty-four from San
Francisco and neighborhood and eight
from Southern California. Of the thirty
two entries twenty-one played hi the qual
ifying round on Wednesday, divided a3
follows â seven from San Francisco, six
from Oakland, two from San Rafael, -five
from Los Angeles and one from Pasa
dena. Thus of the eight entries from
Southern California six put In an appear
ance, while of the twenty-four entries
from San Francisco and neighborhood fif
teen entered the qualifying round. The
two Southern Calif ornians who did not
come up are two of the strongest players
In the State, G. E. Orr and C. B. Maud.
The former has recently lost a relative
by death and the latter is too busy with
the orange crop to leave Riverside at pres
ent. Notwithstanding the absence of these
two veterans, the six southerners secured
four of the first six places in the qualify
ing round, in which H. M. Sears of the
Los Angeles Country Club handed In the
lowest score. Of the six Oakla-nders who
played all secured a place in the sixteen.
The most notable absentees on the slda
of the local golfers were B. D. Adamson.
H. B. Goodwin and S. L. Abbot Jr. of
the San Francisco Golf Club and C. P.
Hubbard of the Oakland Golf Club. S. L.
Abbot Jr. had not entered, as his busi
ness does not permit him to be absent
three consecutive days. The other three
entered, but did not play the qualifying
round. H. M. Sears' score of 176 for four
rounds of the Presidio course, or an aver
age of <4 to each round, on a. day which
was windy throughout was an exceed
ingly good performance, and marked him
out as a strong and even player. "When
the fact is considered that the southern
ers were playing for the first time in
tournament on turf greens, which, how
ever jrood they may be, have not the bil
liard-tablelike trueness of a "skin green,"
their performance Is still more creditable.
The interest of golfers throughout the
State Is concentrated on the first com
petition for the amateur championship of
the Pacific Coast, which, yesterday after
noon reached the final round. At the con
clusion of. to-day's play there will be a
Pacific Coast amateur golf champion.
But, though that will .be the title of the
winner of the final round to-day, he will
really be a champion of all California,
since the Pacific Coast Golf Association
at present Includes in Its list of associate
and allied member no clubs outside of
this State. Long 1 before next year's tour
nament comes off it la practically cer
tain that the golf clubs of Oregon. "Wash
ington and British Columbia will be In
cluded in the association, and that players
from Victoria, Tacoma. Seattle, Spokane
and Portland will be entitled to contend
for the golf blue ribbon of the Pacific
Coast. Y> -. ;

LIEUTENANT EDWARDS
DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED
Officer Who Left Transport at Naga

Lieutenant Edwards of the Twenty
sixth Infantry, who, rather than face a
court rnartial upon his arrival here, left
the transport Garonne at . Nagasaki, has
been dismissed without honor from the
service. He can now return to this coun
try without fear as army boards take no
cognizance of the presence of ex-army of
ficers. No one seems to know upon what
charge the lieutenant would have been
tried and his fellow officers will not talk
about the matter.
The voluntfeers occupying the camps
at the Presidio will be mustered out of
the service before May 15. Colonel Joce
lyn, mustering out officer, has fixed the
following dates for the mustering out of
the regiments: May 1, Twenty-eighth In

of the city and county and sent to the

The actions are all brought by W. "W.
Cunningham, treasurer of the hospital,
with, the consent of the Attorney General.
The first complaint covers the case of
Leo Strassman, who was placed on trial
in the Superior Court on August 13, 1900,
on the charge of assault 'to commit mur
der and was afterward adjudged insane
and committed to the hospital. The Board

Three actions were commenced yester-
George T. McDonnell was brought be
fore United States Court Commissioner
Heacock yesterday morning for examina
tion on the charge of having counterfeit
ing- tools and molds in his possession. The
prisoner had been arrested at noon on
Wednesday by United States Secret Ser
vice Operator Moffltt, and the alleged
counterfeiting tools and molds were found
In his room. On motion of Assistant
United States District Attorney McKin
lay the examination was postponed until
Wednesday of next week at 10 o'clock.
McDonnell was connected many years
ago with the notorious Bidwell brothers
in a scheme to defraud the Bank of Eng
land out of Â£1,000,090, and was suspected
of having forged l^ank of England notes.
Some time after McDonnell's release from
prison he came to this city â about six
years ago â and was leading an honest life,
earning his living as a photographer.
Several months ago McDonnell notified
William A. Pinkerton that a. man named
Young had approached him for the pur
pose of coining Mexican doljars into
American dollars, an operation which
would yield a neat profit of 100 per cent.
He had consented, he said, for the pur
pose of entrapping- Young-. An engraver
made two dies for them, which, however,
were found to be imperfect and were de
stroyed. McDonnell then decided to go
to Mr. Pinkerton to put him on his eruard
against Toune. Nothing- was done in the
matter until the arrest was made by Ope
rator MofStt last Wednesday.
The dies and molds found in McDon
nell's room are blanks, and it Is doubtful
whether a. conviction can be had for that
reason. The prisoner says that they arc
the molds and dies made while he was
with the man Young. The secret service
men are now huntine for Young, who has
plipped throueh their finsrers.
The postal authorities, on the sugges
tion of the local secret service office, are
preparing a complaint against McDonnell
fcr usint the mails In a. petty scheme to
defraud. They decline to give any Infor
mation until the papers shall have been
prepared and the evidence secured.

Morgan were cleverly captured by De
tective Hamill and Policeman Pat Sulli

rancy pending against Walters in Judge
Cabaniss' Court. '
C "W. Young, an ex-soldier from Manila,
met Morgan on Market street yesterday
morning and Morgan showed him through
the Mint. He was so obliging that when
he asked Young to meet him again at 1
o'clock at Sixth and Market streets Young
readily consented.
Hamill observed them talking together
at Sixth and Market streets about 1
o'clock and followed them, to- the house)
on Eddy street. He summoned Sullivan
and the arrests followed.
Young said they introduced him to a
game of stud horse poker. He had only $3
in his pockets and when they discovered
that he had no more money they gave
him back the JS and told him not to

Grand Juror Dunn filed a communica
tion, in which he alleges that the Market

continually, and the Supervisors had the
right to raise the license. .
Acting Secretary Schmltt of the Grand
Jury said that body had declined to ac
cede to the request of Grand Jurors Badg
er and Dunn that the board be petitioned
to increase the license tax on cars.
Secretary Clayton of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Road made a strong pro
test against the passage of the ordinance.
Clayton held that the car lines were pay-
Ing a just share of their revenue to the
city. |
Jere T. Burke said the Market-street
Company paid 30 per cent of its earnings,
or $290,256, to the city in taxes in 1899-1900.
Supervisor McCarthy thought the in
creased license would depend entirely on
the capability of the companies to pay it.
He made a motion that the companies be
directed to file statements of the cost and
maintenance cf the different lines to
gether with their capitalization. Burke
said he thought the board of directors of
the Market-street Company would furnish
the statement.
. The Supervisors' License Committee yes
terday postponed for two weeks 'action on
the proposed ordinance increasing the li
cense tax on street cars from flo to $50 per
annum. This course was taken in order
to allow time to procure certain data con
cerning the cost and capitalization of the
various street railroad companies.

"Longshot" Conley had the leg up on
Donator, favorite for the closing seven
furlong selling affair, and by dull and
stupid riding 1 was beaten by : Goldone. If
the colored boy can do no better he should
go back to the minstrel business, Goldone
went to 7 to 2 in the betting arid won all
the way. Grand Sachem was third.
Russell made such a bungling job of it
astride Montallade* oh Thursday that the
ring laid 18 to 5 against Rio Shannon
when he was posted to ride. The horse
look a sweet 8 to 5 chance and, never
forced to get out of a gallop, led out Sir
Hampton four lengths in 1:42. The last
named horse ruled favorite. Flamero fin
ished third.
Ransch experienced no difficulty what
ever in putting Rollick over the plate
winner of the next selection, also over six
furlongs. Trailing Seide to the stretch,
he then assumed the lead, winning at
leisure. Clarando closed auite a gap. fin
ishing third, only a neck behind Seide.
Had Bassinger not reached for his whip
Mocorito might have taken the show.
There will always exist a doubt as . to
whether Einstein was the best horse in
the third event. At any rate, the *ix
furlongs just suited the uncertain per
former, for he landed first at odds of 6 to
1. a length before Saul of Tarsus. Faunt
leroy, on the favorite. The Miller, after a
hypnotic ride, dropped in third. Hunga
rian might have scored with an intelli
gent rider, but the stunts of E. Mat
thews anchored the horse.
On paper it looked as if Doble & Co.'s
colt Huachuca ought to win the two-year
old number and the majority of big bet
tors got aboard at 9 to 5. A general crowd
ing match iust as the barrier was re
leased seriously retarded the chances of
the favorite as well as one or two others.
Bassinger, on Irma A, a 5 to 1 chance,
slipped away first and Â¦was never caught,
beating San Lutlon out four lengths. Hua
chuca, under vigorous riding, ran a good
third.
A very warm tio some days ago when
he failed to come through, Buck Taylor,
the El Rio Rey four-year-old, defeated
a big bunch of platers in the first event
at five and a half furlones. Sent to the
post favorite with Jack Martin up. he
quickly showed first and won ridden out
from Cane.io and First Shot. The winner
is owned by James Nealon.
Nothing of a sensational character
marked the sport at Tanforan yesterday,
unless it was the downfall of four favor
ites. Bassinger, the colored rider who cut
quite a wide swath at Kinloch Park last
summer, had a shade the best Â¦ of it in
the way of saddle honors, piloting three
winners.
days the local firm has been dick
ering with Barney Schreiber and yester

California Coursing Committee stake, and
only members of the committee will be
allowed the privilege of nominating a dog

without saying.

coursing committee will hold Its annual
meeting. Delegates from all parts of the
State will be in attendance and consider
able important business in the interest of
coursing will be brought up. A banquet
will follow the meeting. The big stake
will be run the next day, and as the in
terior coursing clubs have agreed to close

position. Immediately after the announce

The stake offered for this week's attrac

agement is one of the best and most
evenly balanced of the season. The top
notch championsâ Palo Alto. Beacon and

SUMMARY.
Three more fell to the lot of the locals
in the eighth. Krug hit safe and went to
third on Holland's hit to right. He scored,
on Pabst's drive to left. Nordyke, who
followed next, hit toward first, and would
have been out, but just as the sphere
came within a, few feet of Moskiman it
bounded over his head and traveled out
where the daisies grow in the right gar
den. ' This unavoidable mishap allowed
both Pabst and Holland to amble home.
In the fifth, while Streib was catching
a ball which had been fielded by Borch
ers, he had the nail from one of his fin
gers torn off. He was forced to retire
and Held was substituted. The 3core:

In the third inning the locals secured
their first consignment. Hildebrand
drove a fierce one through Moore at
third and was advanced to second by
â¢Schwartz's sacrifice, Holland was pre
sented with a check good for one. Pabst
hit an easy chance to Moore, who, for
getting for the moment the locality of the
first cushion, whirled the sphere into the
bleachers, allowing both Holland and
Schwartz to score.
Only once in yesterday's game did the
locals allow the artists from over the bay
to touch ' the rubber on the homeward
journey. Not until the ninth did the Oak
land Scoreboard contain a mark to mar
it3 unblemished whiteness. Ham Iburg
was in the box and rieht nobly did he
perform.- His delivery was touched for
but seven hits. Six strikeouts were re
corded to his credit, and not a single free
ticket was issued by him for the first sta
tion. Nordyke made his debut at third,
and gathered in eight chances without a
single misconnection.

In the semi-final round two local piay
ers,, John Lawson and E. R. Folger, were
pitied against two Southern Calif ornians
â J. S. Cravens and William Frederick
son. John Lawson, who played great golf
throughout the day and showed himself
clearly superior to any of the contestants,
made his first round against Fredenck
&on in 39, or equal to bogey. At the thir
teenth hole he was dormy, and at the
fourteenth won 6 up and 4 to play. E. R.
Kolgrer and J. S. Cravens played a ding
dong match, the Oakland player never
securing any substantial lead, but event
rally winning 1 up. Thus, of the five
southerners who qualified three reached
the second round and two survived until
the semi-final round. Cravens and Fred
erickson carried down to their southern
homes two bronze medals as mementoes
of the first contest for the Pacific Coast
KfJt championship. John Lawson and E.
R. Folger are left to contend to-day in a
match over thirty-six holes, half of
v hich will be played in the morning and
halt in the afternoon, for the gold and sil
ver medals. Unless something quite un
fcreseea should happen, the gold medal
will be carried off by the San Francisco
man, and the handsome silver cup, em
blematic of the championship, will adorn
the Presidio Club house until the second
annual tournament, to be held next year
in the southern part of the State.
The second round of the tournament for
the Pacific Coast golf championship was
played yesterday morning, the weather
being- pleasanter than on the two previ
ous days of the contest. John Lawson of
the San Francisco Golf Club beat H. C.
(Jclcher of the same club 7 up 6 to play,
but the other three matches, in each of
which a Southern California man was
paired against a local golfer, were very
close. B. II. Hay Chapman of the Los
Angeles Country Club led E. R, Folger
of the Oakland Golf Club to the eleventh
hole, where he was 3 up and 7 to play;
but Folger. playing a line uphill game,
took five of the remaining seven holes in
21, or only one stroke above bogev, thus
winning the match 2 up. J. S. Cravens of
the Pasadena Country Club and J. H.
Mec of the .San Francisco Golf Club
played the closest match of the tourna
ment, being all square at the eighteenth
hole, An extra hole was taken by Cra
vens, who won 1 up on nineteen holes.

CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., "WASHINGTON, April 26.â Attorney
General Knox, acting under instructions
from the President, proposes to institute
immediately proceedings to_ recover some
of the money which former Captain O. M.
Carter of the army obtained from the Gov
ernment in connection with frauds grow
ing out of the improvements in Savannah
harbor.
A secret conference between Attorney
General : Knox and the Federal officers
who has been working, on this case has
been in progress- at the Department of
Justice during the present week to map
out a plan of action. Soon after Mr. Knox
became a member of the Cabinet his at
tention was called to the case of Carter.
"Without any. intention of reflecting- upon
his immediate predecessor Mr. Griggs, the
new Attorney General, was given to un
derstand that prompt action to recover
some of the Government funds was re
quired. It is understood that he was given
the impression that too much time had
already been wasted by the Government
in prosecuting the case of Carter.
After the subject was fully discussed in
the Cabinet Attorney General Knox issued
a call to all Government officials who have
been prominently identified with this case
to como to Washington for consultation.
In response to this call District Attorney
Irwin of Georgia and his assistant, Mr.
Iseakln of Savannah; District Attorney
Burnett of New York; Colonel Barr, as
sistant judge advocate general, who con
ducted the Carter court-martial on behalf
of the Government, and Bank' Examiner
Johnson of the Treasury Department, who
located the Government funds Involved in
the case in various banks, assembled In
the Department of Justice.
The subject was reviewed from begin
ning to end and the conclusion was reached
that no further time should be wasted in
taking prompt measures to recover as far
as possible the funds lost to the Govern
ment through â¢ the frauds practiced by
Carter and Tiis associates In connection
with the Savannah harbor Improvements.
Bank Examiner Johnson is said to have
located in various banks in Savannah,
New York -and other cities sums aggre
gating something like $750,000, which are
Baid to be traced directly . to Carter and
his connection with Savannah harbor ex
penditures.
The proceedings of the conference were
conducted with the greatest secrecy and
all the â¢ participants were admonished to
regard as - confidential the conclusions
reached.,

rROM figures compiled in the Auditor's office
and published in The Call yesterday it appears
the department of the city government known as
the Bureau of Streets might be better named the
Bureau of Salaries. Of the money appropriated for
its use in the public service it expends just about twice
as much for salaries and wages as it does for repairs
upon streets. It is clesr, therefore, that under the
present management the bureau exists much more for.
the purpose of providing salaries to officials than for
the purpose of street work. '
The figures, which cover a period'of six months,
from September to Febiuary inclusive, tell their story
so clearly that nothing in the way of comment is
needed to bring out the waste that is being made of
public money.' In September the sum of $8120. -25
was expended iri salaries for the Bureau 'of Streets,
including the. wages of laborers, while the amount of
repairs made to accepted streets and sewers aggre
gated only $1226 58. In October salaries consumed
$9702 08 of the taxpayers' money, and the results- for
that month show only $2418 63 worth of repairs to
streets. In November salaries ate up $9037 12 and
still the cost of the work was far less than that
amount, being but $5448 32. In December the sala
ries climbed up to $9832 64, and the work done in re
pairs to accepted streets amounted to only $5027 08.
Tn January the salary account of the Bureau of Streets
reached the enormous total of $10,286 41, whereas a
little more than half that sum, or $5701, represents
the actual amount spent for repairs to streets. In
February the salaries dropped down to $8287 75, and
this is the only month when the amount of work done
exceeded the salaries paid. The total sum expended
in improvements was ?r5<736 26.
The story is an old one. Month after month the
record of big salaries ?nd little work accomplished
has been placed before the public. 'The present com
pilation, however, for a period of six successive
.months makes" the case more clear than it appeared. in
'.he record of any single' month.. It will now be seen

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
means every phase of the development of
the cold area is carefully watched, and
v. - hen the danger is great each observa
tory In the threatened region becomes a
distributing center from which warnings
are sent to those who have produce or
perishable articles of manufacture that
need protection against low temperature.
In such cases the system of distribution
is so perfect that it is not uncommon for
the bureau to distribute 100,000 telegrams
and messages inside of the space of one
01 two hours, so that nearly every city,
village and hamlet receives the Informa
tion in time to profit thereby. What this
means to the farmer and shipper is well
illustrated in a single instance. From
those personally interested we gathered
statements relative to the sweep of one
cold wave, and these showed that over
$3,400,000 worth of property that would
h&ve been destroyed by the low tempera
tures was saved.
To ftÂ»e sure, sometimes the surging of
the great air eddies which constitute our
rainstorms and cold waves â one the low
pressure eddy and the other the high
pressure eddyâ deflects the course of the
storm or minimizes the degree of cold,
find the warnings may partially or wholly
fail of verification: but in these impor
tant atmospheric disturbances the warn
ings are justified In such a large propor
tion of cases that those whose property
Is at stake do not longer question the util
ity of the Government service. That no
ether country brings its citizens into such
close touch with its weather conditions Is
shown by the fact that even when severe
storms are not imminent there Is, in ad
dition to the printing of the forecasts in
the daily press, a dally distribution of
SO ,000 telegrams, maps and bulletins, that
places the information in the hands of
millions whose personal interests are ma
terially affected by the weather.
Distribution of Forecasts.
There are more than 2000 dally papers
In the United States and each one of
these prints in" a conspicuous place the
dally weather prediction. Did it ever oc
cur to you that there is no other informa
tion that receives publication and atten
tion by readers each day of the year In
every daily paper of the country? There
are forty-seven tri-weekly papers In tho
United States, 434 semi-weekly and 14,734
weekly publications, the greater number
of which publish the weekly weather crop
bulletins of the bureau for their respective
States. Each State forms a section of the
national service, and from a central of
fice issues monthly reports on the minute
climatology of the State. These cllma
tcloglcal data are gathered from standard
thermometers and rain gauges that are
placed in each county. The Information
finds extensive publication also in the
weekly and monthly periodicals.
Recently the Postofflce Department,
through its rural mall delivery, has placed
at the disposal of the weather service one
of the most efficient means of bringing Its
daily forecasts, frost and cold-wave warn
ings to the very doors of those who can
make the most profitable use of them. The
latest forecast of the weather Is printed
on small slips of paper and each carrier
is given a number equal to the number
of houses on his rural route. Thus does
the meteorological. service insinuate itself
into every avenue that promises efficient
dissemination of its reports. To be fore
warned is to be forearmed. It Is the opin
ion of many insurance and other experts
that the meteorological service of the
United States Government is worth over
5Â£(>,000,000 annually to the agriculture, the
commerce and the industry of the coun
try; and this notwithstanding the large
element of error that for a long time to
come must enter into predictions.
Benefit to Fruit-Grower and Farmer.
The utilities of the weather service are
well illustrated by the benefits that the
fruit interests of California derive from
the rain warnings. On account of the pe
culiar topography of that region these
warnings are made with a high degree of
accuracy but a few hours before the corn-
Ing of the rain, yet far enough in advance
to enable the owners of vineyards, most of
which are connected by telephones, to
gather and stack their trays and thus
save the drying raisins from destruction.
Along 1 the Rocky Mountain plateau and
the eastern slope our stations are so nu
merous and our system of distribution so
perfect that the sweep of every cold wave
is heralded to every ranch that has tele
graphic communication. In the cranberry
marshes of Wisconsin the flood gxtes are
regulated by the frost warnings of the
bureau, and where formerly a profitable
crop was secured only once In several
years It Is now a rare exception that dam
age occurs. As we go farther south and
east into the Gulf and South Atlantic
States our frost warnings are made with
a greater degTee of accuracy than in any
other part of the country. We find the
growers of sugar cane in Louisiana, the
truck growers from Norfolk south to Jack
sonville and the orange growers of Florida
timing their operations by the frost warn
ings of the bureau. From the estimates of
these industrialists It is indicated that the
amount annually saved to them Is far
greater than that expended for the sup
port of the entire department.
Under the direction of Secretary Wilson
we are now arranging with Europe and
the Azore Islands for the receipt of meteor
ological reports, which, in connection
with our present extensive system, will
enable us to forecast wind direction and
wind force for trans-Atlantic steamers
for a period of three days out from each
continent. This extension of the meteoro
logical service has long been, sought by
mariners. The new German cable from
Lisbon to New York enables us to get
direci communication with several Islands
the reports from which are necessary in
the taking up of this new and important
Â¦work.
Forecasting Floods and Freshets.
No less valuable is the flood-warning
service which Is In operation along our
large river courses. So much advance has
been made in forecasting- flood stages that
It is now possible to foretell three to five
days In advance the height of the river at
a given point to within a few inches. The
danger line at every city has been accur
ately determined and .. charted, so that
when a flood is likely to exceed the dan
ger limit residents of low districts and
merchants having goods stored in cellars
are notified to move their property out
of reach of the rising waters. An illustra
tion of the efficiency of this system was
shown during the great flood of 1S37
Throughout nearly the whole area that
wa , s submerged the warning bulletins pre
ceded the flood by several days and tho
statisticians of the Government estimate
that $15,000,000 worth of livestock and Sov
able property was removed to high ground
as the result of the f orewarninls. Th e "e
warnings are distributed from fifteen
river centers at each of which a trained
forecaster is located who daily is in Jos

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The professor has traveled abroad and spent much
time in Russia. Returning he appears as counsel for
the Czar to vindicate the seizure of Manchuria and the
robbery of China. In ins lecture on that subject the
professor said: "A compact has been placed before
the Chinese Government by the Russian Govern
ment according to the terms of which Russia was to
look after the military government of Manchuria and
its railroad interests and China was to remain in pos
session of the civil administration. Manchuria being
contiguous territory ta Russia only, no other power
apparently has any right to object to this compact.
I believe that Russia should have the same privilege of
applying the Monroe doctrine to the territory which
is contiguous exclusively to her own, and in which
no other European country is interested, and es
pecially when the power to which this doctrine is ap
plied is contented."
It is no wonder that busy people get false ideas
sbout national right and duty when those thought to
bt learned men, and who are set apart and paid Tor
I". ring learned, utter Â«uch clotted nonsense. In the
first place China is not willing to be robbed, and pro
tested and dela3-ed in the hope that the other powers
would prevent it. But they are so intent on robbing
her of cash that they have no time to prevent Russia
robbing her of land. The Russian process has no
njore resemblance to *be Monroe doctrine than it has
to the Ten Commandments. According to Pro
fessor Grosvenor under the Monroe doctrine we can
claim the right of military government of Mexico and
the administration of her railways. While it is true
thac other Governments may not interfere in such
case between us and Mexico, the proceeding would
not be hallowed by thcit abstention. . '
Under the Monroe doctrine Russia would have the
right to prevent any paitition of China, but not the
light to 6teal it herself. But the professor goes fur
ther in the same lecture and thereby the rest of th
wcrld fares worse. He declares that only Russia and
Germany have been wronged in the Boxer revolu
tion, Germany because her Minister was murdered
and Russia because the Boxers invaded her territory
north of the Amur.
The other nations should heed this Amherst decree
and get out of Cathay at once, leaving Germany and
Russia to carve the country to suit themselves, i,;-.
This Amherst professor, Grosvenor by name, occu-
I if s the chair of "Modern Governments and Their Ad
ministrations." It will be seen, therefore, that he is
supposed to know what he talks about, for it is his
specialty, and he is paid for knowing and for telling
what he kno;vs.
Just as this deformity of the doctrine is put aside
there appears a worse. This time the plastic artist
v.hc has changed the features of it until Monroe hini
iitlf would run and hide from them' is not a Senator.
His offense is of a higher degree because he is a pro
fessor. He teaches young men m Amherst and is
probably looked up to by many who hope to be Sena
tors and to apply in that high chamber the learning
thev absorb in his classroom.
When this bumptious rumor had run at large for a
v.!;:le it was disavowed at Washington, much to the
satisfaction of all Americans who have correct idea.s
of the Monroe doctrine and of the propriety of na
tional conduct.
Among the tales that have impinged upon its dis
tortion is the recent rumor that our Government had
sent a curt note to Copenhagen warning King Chris
tian that he must not sell his West Indies to any
body but us! This wo^ld establish an American cor
r.er on everything within our horizon and would be
a proceeding of the most extraordinary nature.
It would be using the Monroe doctrine as a means
cf conquest without the expense of war.
IT was a United States Senator who discovered that
the transfer of the Danish West Indies by Den
mark to Germany would be an fhfraction of the
Monroe doctrine.
The declaration by Monroe was that any attempt
lo extend European institutions in this, hemisphere
would be regarded as unfriendly to the United States.
The transfer of territory from one European power to
another would not be an extension here of European
institutions. Denmark could make any such transfer
v/ilhout any infraction of that American theory.
â¢The Senator's ill digested interpretation has been
the cause of a lot of farming rumors. The Monroe
doctrine has been juggled with until in its different
fantastic forms it has lost all semblance of the original
article.
MORE MONROE DOCTRINE.
Such, then, is the scheme. All politics is to mean
possession of the wealth of. the island, and as. Ameri
can labor cannot work there, and native labor is too
content with little to work much, the desired "effi
cient labor" will doubtless be some kind of coolie
system. The campaign on the subject during the
summer will be worth watching, and it is. fortunate
we. have a President who can be relied upon to keep
the pledges of the natiji.
Then follows the old cry of the annexationist, the
appeal to the lust for wealth: "This island is a veri
table El Dorado, of which under Spanish stewardship
only the riches that lie on the surface have been gath
ered up. Capital, intelligent cultivation and efficient
bbor would increase the annual product far beyond
1 he maximum yield of the best period. It is a sin
for any man of ability to concern himself with politics
here, except as a means to the desired end of estab
lishing conditions favorable to the bringing forth of
the incalculable wealth of this island."
It would be difficult to find a cleverer method of
suggesting a falsehood while disclaiming responsi
bility for it. The Times man, however, does not con
fine himself to such delicate suggestions as that. He
goes. on to say of the Cubans: "The Teller resolu
tion fired the ambition of these untried men, but it
filled the hearts of conservative men with foreboding
and despair. It drove them out of politics altogether
and kept them' from the polls in the election of last
September when delegates to the convention were
cfiosen. They are the owners of about all the prop
erty in the island; they are its men of substance,' of
business activity and sobriety of judgment." Those
men, he goes on. to say. are in fear of what will hap
pen to their property and their trade should the Cu
bans be left to. establish a government of their. own.
He adds: "The annexation of Cuba is the solution
oi the problem to which we shall come at last â so
was the familiar prophecy here and at home."
The writer disclaims vouching for either, of the
stories, and adds: "The mere suggestion of a sordid
origin for the pledge which so many good men have
extolled as a check upon the aggressions of an impe
rialistic administration by the stern will of a liberty
loving people is so painful that I dismiss both inven
tions with the expression of a hope that their authors
may never prosper."
The New York Times has an "editorial correspond
ent" in Cuba who is furnishing that paper with a
series of articles clearly designed to foster the annexa
tion spirit. He begins a recent article by saying he
has heard two explanations of the Teller resolution
declaring the Cubans ought to be independent and
disclaiming any intention on the part of the United
States to exercise sovereignty over the island. One
of these is that the resolution was prompted by the
sugar trust from a desire to keep Cuban sugar out of
this country. The other is that the resolution was due
to the efforts of holders of Cuban bonds, who. be
lieve they will have a better chance of getting pay
ment from Cuba than from the United States should
our Government annex the islands.
The news is the more gratifying because the ele
ments working for the complete .annexation of Cuba
to the United States were never more active than
row, and all the signs of the time point to the con
clusion that during the summer an effort will be made
to work up. a public sentiment favorable to the
schemes of the annexationists.
DISPATCHES frorr Washington announce that
while the Secretary of State declines to give
out reports of his first conference with the
delegation from the Cuban constitutional convention,
yet the discussion with the Secretary as well as the
informal talk with the President when the delegation,
was presented to him showed so much of harmony
between the views of orr Government and those of
the delegates as to justify the expectation that all
misunderstandings will be cleared up and an amicable
settlement made of all points in controversy.

' About thÂ« only knowledge that most
readers have of the workings of the Unit
ed States Weatter Bureau of the Depart
ment of Agriculture is gathered from the
dally prediction of rain or snow that they
encounter at the breakfast table as they
glance over the morning paper. They
base their estimate of the utility of the
weather service on the accuracy of the
predictions thus hastily scanned, and
many are prone to inquire whether It Is
true that this service has really made a
place for itself in the great industrial
economy of our country; whether or not
an adequate return Is made for the ex
penditure of "over Jl.000,000 annually;'
whether the science of weather forecast
ing has reached its highest degree of ac
curacy, and whether it holds out possibil
ities of future Improvement. They would
doubtless be cmazed if they knew the
thousand and one ramifications through
which this system to-day operates and
through the medium of which it reaches,
daily, probably more than one-half of our
adult population.
Origin, of Scientific "Weather Study.
About 100 years after the invention of
the barometer*-namely, in 1747â Benjamin
Franklin divined that certain storms had
a rotary motion and that they progressed
in a northeasterly direction. It was pro
phetic that these ideas should have come
to him long before any one. had ever pre
pared charts showing observations simul
taneously taken at many stations. But,
although his ideas in this respect were
more important than his act of drawing
the lightning f â¢om the clouds and identi
fying it with electricity of the laboratory,
his contemporaries thought little of his
philosophy of storms. It remained for'
Redfield, Espy, Maury, Loomis and Abbe,
100 years later, to gather the data and
completely establish the truth of that
which the great Franklin had dimly out
lined. Although American scientists were
the pioneers In discovering the rotary and
progressive character of storms, and'Mn
demonstrating the practicability of weath
er services, the United States was the
fourth country to give legal status to a
weather service; but no one of the other
countries had an area large enough to
render it possible to construct such a
broad, synoptic picture of air conditions
as is necessary in the making of the most
usefulforecasts. It would require an in
ternational service, embracing all the
countries of Europe, to equal ours in the
extent of area covered.
Congress authorized the first appropria
tion of $20,000 to inaugurate a tentative
weather service in 1870. General Albert J.
Myer, to whom was assigned the position
of chief of the new meteorological service,
doubtless had no conception of the future
wonderful extension of the system that he
was then authorized to begin. Former
Secretary of Agriculture J. Sterling Mor
ton did much to place the meteorological
service of the Government on a suitable
foundation by having all its employes and
higher officials classified and placed with
in the civil service. The present Secretary
of Agriculture, James Wilson, has con
tinued the merit system in the Weather
Bureau, and has greatly Improved and ex
tended its operations. Thanks to his pol
icy, the weather service has had a phe
nomenal . growth during the last four
years. . , ' .
Work of the Weather Forecaster.
It is a wonderful picture of atmospheric
conditions that is presented twice daily
to the trained eye of the weather fore
caster. It embraces an area extending
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the
north coast of South America over Mex
ico, the islands of the West Indies and
the Bahamas, northward to the utter
most confines of Canadian habitation. It
is a panoramic picture of the exact air
conditions over this broad area that i9
twice daily presented to the study of our
experts. Hurricanes, cold waves, hot
waves or rainstorms are shown wherever
present in this broad area. Their devel
opment since last reported is noted and
from the knowledge thus gained their fu
ture course and intensity Is quite success
fully forecast. Every twelve hours the
kaleidoscope changes, and a new graphic
picture of weather conditions is shown.
Nowhere else in the world can meteorolo
gists find such an opportunity to study
storms and atmospheric changes.
Iu our Atlantic and gulf ports alone
there are floating over $30,000,000 worth of
craft on any day of the year; and at
every port, whether on the Atlantic, on
the Pacific or on the lakes, there is either
a full meteorological observatory, or else
a storm warning display man, who at
tends to the lighting of the danger lights
on the storm warning towers at night,
to the display of danger flags by day and
to the distribution of storm warning mes
sages among vessel masters. This system
is so perfect that the chief of the weather
bureau or the forecaster on duty at the
central' office can dictate a storm warn
ing and feel certain that Inside one hour
a copy of the warning will be in the hands
of every vessel Â¦ master in i every port of
material size in the United States,'pro
vided it is his desir6 that a complete dis
tribution of the warning be made. As a
matter of fact, the storm warnings us
ually go to only a limited portion of the
coast at one time. While the daily pre
dictions of rain or snow by which, as
previously stated, the public measures the
value of the weather service, are sub
ject to a considerable element of error,
namely, about one failure in five predic
tions, the marine warnings of the ser
vice have -been so well made that in over
six years no protracted storm has reached
any point of the -United States without
warnings Â£eing displayed well in advance.
Savings Effected by the Bureau.
As a result of these warnings the loss
of life and property has been reduced to
a minimum, being doubtless not more
than 25 per cent of what it would have
been without this extensive system, which
comes daily and almost hourly. Into com
munication with mariners. The public
does not appreciate this part of the ser
vice for the reason that, as a rule, these
; warnings do not appear in the newspa
pers. It Is not desirable to publish them,
so far in advance as to hold shipping In
port unnecessarily. We only aim to place
warnings twelve or sixteen hours In ad
vance of the coming of the 1 storm, and
then we communicate by telegraph, by
messenger and by : warning lights and
flags directly with the masters of vessels.
It is a notable example of the utility
of the new West Indian weather service,
and of the wisdom of Congress in con
tinuing as a perpetual Instrument of peace
the service organized to meet an emer
gency of war, that the Galveston hurri
cane was detected on September 1, at the
time of its inception, in the ocean south
of Porto Rico, and that the new system
of West Indian reports gave us such com
plete simultaneous data that at no time
did we lose track of the storm. Every
where, as it progressed northward, such
full information was given that, notwith
standing the extensive commerce of the
Gulf of Mexico, little or no loss of life
or property occurred upon the, ocean wat
ers of the gulf. The destruction at Gal
veston was many times less than It would
have been without the premonition that
was given and the activity of the bureaus
officers in urging residents to move. from
the low grounds of the city to its more
secure portions. Again, as this storm re
curved and passed over the lake region
the warnings were well distributed. Al
though the energy of the -storm was so
great that few vessels were stanch enough
to live through its fury, shipping remained
safely ! in harbors and there was not a
life lost. . .
Cold Wave Becords.
When a marked cold wave develops in.
the. north plateau of the Rocky Moun
tains and- by its broad area and great
barometric pressure threatens to sweep
southward and eastward with its icy
blasts the meteorological stations of the
bureau are ordered to take observations
evtry few hours in the region immedi
ately In advance of the cold area and to
telegraph these to headquarters. By this

CHIEF OP THE UNITED STATES BUREAU.
How Science Under Direction of the Federal
Authorities Warns Us on the Freaks
and Fancies of the Weather.
Prepared by Experts and Specialists for
The San Francisco Call
This must have occurred to Minister Conger, and
he doubtless took all " these precautions. Levying
upon an entire village or city for the acts of a mob
means that the innocent are paying a damage which
they did not inflict, an-1 for this additional reason they
should be protected in every possible way. Such,
method of settlement is to be regarded with aversion
and adopted with very great caution. The presence
of the Christian armies in China destroyed equality
between the tribute-taking missionaries and the
tribute-paying Chinese. The frowning presence of
power may have easily contributed to the alacrity
with which voluntary contributions were made, and
without the precautions which doubtless occurred ic
Minister Conger great wrong might easily have been
done.
A glance at the system exhibits the extreme care
and caution that should be used in putting it in force.
A reversal of conditions will bring this need of great
precaution plainly in view. When 175 Chinese were
murdered by being burned to death in their cabins in
Wyoming, or were shot as they ran blazing with
seated eyeballs through-: the fire, if a large Chinese
army had been in this country and our people had no
army at all and our. Government had been disorgan
ized and incapable of defense, it would have been
thought hard if the Chinese Minister had advised his
countrymen to proceed to collect indemnity from
Wyoming, unofficially end without limit or restric
tion as to amount, and with, no guarantee that its
voluntary payment would exclude its contributors
from the burden of a general indemnity to be laid
by China upon this country.
Doubtless all these considerations occurred to the
Minister, and admonition to observance of these plain
principles of justice went with his advice to American
rrissionaries to recoup themselves in that way.
Another condition cf equity in such method of col
lection would be the keeping of a proper account with
each village, debiting it with the life lost or property
destroyed and crediting it with indemnity paid. This
is absolutely necessary. Every claim so paid is ex
tinguished and canceled. But if no record is kept the
same claim may be presented in the general mass of
claims and be paid again in the general indemnity,
thus inflicting a crying injustice upon the villages
which, we are assured, paid voluntarily. The next
important consideration is the proper custody of the
money so collected. How. much and where is it are
inquiries that should be made and answered.
This clears -the air -as to the facts. These levies
weÂ»e not forbidden but were advised by the American
Minister. This being true, other things of necessity
fellow. In such a matter there should be some means
taken to properly estimate the value of the property
destroyed or the indemnity due for loss of life. Ob
viously all rules of Christian justice are violated when
such estimate is one-sided and those who are to re
ceive the indemnity are permitted to measure the
amount. After the amount is justly determined those
who pay it should be protected by such form of re
ceipt as will shelter them from further levy. To illus
trate: If in a village there is only American mis
sionary property and th? villageis pay indemnity fo~
its destruction they should be excluded from taxation
to pay indemnity for the destruction of French or
German missionary property in some other part of
the empire. Minister Conger says that such pay
ments were voluntary. Under the conditions exist
ing in China when this system of private collection
began voluntary payment had to depend on the assur
ance that the Christian armies would not appear and
avenge refusal to pay. The presence of those armies
rtid the record they had made in march and foray
constituted a state of duress that made it a very un
fortunate time for voluntary payment of village in
demnity, so that doubtless every care was taken to
assure the villages that in no event would the Chris
tian soldiers appear.
Â¦nr^HE fact of unofficial collection of indemnity
I money by missionaries from Chinese has been
*Â¦ established. An American missionary in a recent
publication admitted this, but excused it by declaring
that they were authorize i to make these collections by
Minister Conger.
On the Minister's arrival in San Francisco he was
notified of this admission and thereupon said: "I ad
vised them that wherever they could make a settle
ment themselves with the villages where these mur
deis or destruction of property occurred to make it.
Do it upon your own responsibility; I take no part
in it and the legation takes no part in it. There was
no going out and compelling people to pay anything.
Tt was voluntary on their part."
CHINESE TRiEUTE
It needs no argument to show intelligent men that
when more than two dollars is paid in salaries to
get less than one dollar's worth of work done there
is something radically wrong with the administration.
Under any charter, or under no charter at all, officials
who had any sense of their responsibility to the public
would get better results than that. The issue is one
that concerns every citizen. No community is rich
enough to afford a bureau whose main purpose is that
cf providing salaries foi its officers and employes.
that the waste is not in occasional one, but is a per
sistent evil. In the whole period under review there
ic but one in which the expenditures for work were
greater than the expenditures for salaries and wages..
Moreover, in some months the excess of salaries w-as
irany times greater than the whole expenditure for.
wr-rk. We have, therefore, to confront not a tem
porary waste merely but a programme of extrava
grrce thatgoes on almost without interruption fro;n
month to month.
The present administration went into office with
the most emphatic promises of economy and improve
ment. Government under the new charter was placed
by the people in the hands of the so-called "frienos
of the charter." in order that the merits of the new
system might be fully revealed to the taxpayers and
to the citizens generally. The results have been
worse than anything that could have happened had
the administration been intrusted to those who were
called "the enemies of the charter." In fact, had a
set of public officials deliberately set about showing
thp defects of the charter they could not have done it
more effectually than has been done by the blunder
ing or worse of the present administration.

DROP LETTERSâ J. C. H., City. ThÂ«
law fixing the rate of postage at one cent
on drop letters went into effect in 1851 and
is yet the law In places where there Is no

each half ounce where there Is a free
delivery and one cent where there is no
such system."
PARROTâ J. B., City. The parrot has
the power to imitate sounds, words and
sentences, but close observation has dem
onstrated that the bird does not know
the meaning of what It says. The parrot
will after having eaten a hearty meal of
Its favorite food say "Polly wants a
cracker" and if one is offered It may, out
of a spirit of mischief, for It Is a mischie
vous bird, take a proffered cracker and
break it up, but not eat It, and white
breaking it will continue calling for a
cracker. If the bird knew the value of
the words It speaks It would undoubtedly
call for a cracker when it needed It, and
would not call for it when it had no de
sire for it. There have been many stories
of the Intelligence of parrots, but such
have all been romances.

SAMPLE-CASE MEN
IN GRAND COUNCIL
Mrs. Pfaff is a glovemaker and bears the
reputation of being a hard-working and
estimable wife and mother.
The news of her husband's suicide was
broken to Mrs. Pfaff by Mrs. Louise G.
Fabian,, the matron of the women's ward
at the prison. The matron tried to con
sole the wretched prisoner, but her efforts
were unavailing. Mrs. Pfaff screamed,
and, throwing herself upon the floor,
begged to be allowed to die. When na
ture had exhausted Itself, Mrs. Pfaff lay
moaning on her cot in the matron's room,
her condition arousing the sympathy of
all the officials in the prison, hardened as
they are to scenes of misery.
This morning Attorney Gallagher will
argue a writ of habeas corpus on behalf
of Mrs. Pfaff before Judge Carroll Cook,
and it is generally expected that the wom
an will be released. If she secures her
freedom, kind-hearted friends will take
care of her and try to lighten the burden
of her misery.
Pitiful Scene at City Prison.
The unfortunate man, after looping a
noose around hlB neck, had tied the rope
to. a transom, jumped off a chair and
strangled to death. Not a scrap of writ
ing was found in the house or in the dead
man's pockets that might have explained
why he had taken his life.
work, lost his position as a mechanic on
the Government transport dock.
Sending his two little children to be
cared for by relatives, Pfaff brooded over
his troubles in the desolate home at 337
Twelfth street. On Wednesday he called
upon hfs wife. He was very despondent.
He promised to see her on Thursday, but
did not do so. His wife thought that he
had again secured a position and looked
forward to meeting him. The unfortunate
man was in the habit of visiting his wife's
aunt, Mrs. E. Stanton, each evening at
her home on Sheridan street. Mrs. Stan
ton, alarmed at not seeing Pfaff for two
evenings, yesterday went to his home. She
found the doors locked and sought the
assistance of women neighbors. Ascend
ing the rear stairs, the women peered
through the window and saw Praff's body
hanging in a doorway. Screaming with
fright, Mrs. Stanton and her companions
fled and notified Police Officer Rheil.
Rheil. assisted by Daniel Holtzel, entered
Pfaff's rooms, only to find that the man
was dead. The appearance of the body
Indicated that Pfaff had been dead for
about two days. The Coroner's office was
notified and the body was removed to the
Morgue.
p-yiÂ«^HE Irony of fate was exemplified
I yesterday morning in the matron's
II ward of the prison at the Hall of
il Justice, when Mrs. Maggie Pfaff,
charged with the murder of her
friend, Mrs. Mamie Marvin, sat awaiting
the coming of her husband, all uncon
scious of the fact that his body reposed
on a suicide's slab at the Morgue, not fifty
feet away.
Feeling keenly the disgrace of his wife's
arrest and broken-hearted at the rupture
of his home and loss of employment,
Frank Pfaff, without a word of farewell
to his wife or children, hanged himself
some time during Wednesday night or
Thursday morning.
On the evening of April 10 Mrs. Pfaff,
accompanied by her little boy, called at
the home of Mrs. Marvin, 1411A Folsom
street. The women had been chums at
school and grew up to womanhood togeth
er. In a spirit of fun Mrs. Pfaff, finding
her friend was not home, played a prac
tical joke. Assisted by xÂ»Irs. Granvillo of
3507 Seventeenth street, the furniture of
Mrs. Marvin's parlor was piled against
the door and the gate of the house was
locked. When Mrs. Marvin arrived home
she did not enter into the spirit of the
Joke played upon her and used sharp
words.
Mrs. Pfaff Accused of Murder.
It is alleged that Mrs. Pfaff picked up
a lighted lamp and hurled it at Mrs. Mar
vin, setting her clothes on fire. Mrs. Mar
vin was terribly burned and died at St.
Mary's Hospital on the following day.
Mrs. Pfaff was herself burned about the
head and was taken into custody by the
police and charged with murder.
Before Mrs. Marvin died she madej a
statement to Officer Noltlng that Mrs.
Pfaff had thrown the lamp at her; Mrs.
Granvllle testified at the Inquest and in
the Police Court that she had seen the
lamp thrown, hut Mrs. Pfaff has strenu
ously denied that she touched the lamp.
She has insisted all along that the lamp
was either accidentally upset or exploded.
Pfaff visited his wife each day at the
prison and as a result of neglecting his

UTAH, April 26.â The first clash be
tween the Oregon Short Line men and
Senator Clark's forces for possession of
the disputed Utah and California grade
occurred to-day, " when twenty-two
wagons loaded with ties were driven up
to the right of way by order of Superin
tendent Young. The first team was
promptly stopped by the Clark forces.
Sheriff Johnson then demanded that the
teams be allowed to pass over the pub
lic road, but the Clark forces again re
fused to allow the teamsters to proceed.
The teamsters then attempted to force
their horses through, but the Clark men,
heavily reinforced, and armed with
shovels and pickhandles, rushed to the
horses', heads and again stopped them.
For two' hours the struggle was kept up,
several of the teamsters in the meantime
succeeding in breaking through and get
ting Itheir wagons up on the right of way.
Finally the Clark forces asked for an
armistice and an agreement was reached
whereby the wagons are not to be un
loaded and the Clark forces are to retire
to their second line of defense at the
barber wire trocha. two miles down tne
grade, pending a determination in court
of the respective rights of the claimants.
This action, it is believed, removes the
danger of further clash between the rival

That money is to be distributed In charity,
under instructions, if the accusations against
Mayor Clark cannot be provedâ the accusa
tions made both under oath and In published
Interviews â to the effect that the Mayor had
an Interest in the poolrooms; that he favored
the poolrosm licensing ordinance; that he
wanted it altered so as to make it imperative
upon him to Issue licenses; and that he vetoed
the ordinance on the night It was passed, .in
perfect knowledge of the programme that It
was to be nassed over his veto.
It is asked that Rev. C. A. Dickinson, Rev.
S. J. Carroll. Rev. A. B. Banks. Rev. C. L.
Miel and Father Quinn accept this money and
distribute It in charity as they, or the ma
jority of them, may see fit â provided these
statements against the Mayor shall not be
proved to their entire, satisfaction, by the par
ties making such charges, at any time they
may desire to investigate. They have been
named In this matter because the churches
were a very strong potent Influence In the
closing of the poolrooms, and these' ministers
would certainly form a committee which
should be acceptable to all parties concerned.
The editor of the Bee has been handed the
sum of $1000 in gold coin of the United States,
which he has deposited In the California State
Despite the denials contained In Mayor
Clark's statement, the following appeared
conspicuously displayed in to-night's Bee,
accompanied by a certification from the
cashier of the California State Bank that
he has received the sum of $1000 to be paid
by him on the order of the -clergymen
named, who are the most prominent di
vines in the city:
Will Prove or Pay.
I refused point blank to lend my support to
any ordinance that would permit the selling: of
pools at any place other than the racetrack
during the races. The arguments used to gain
'my co-operation were of several kinds, but the
one upon which Cavanaugh laid the most stress
was that I ought to stand for it because "Jack"'
Wright was Interested with them and I owed
him something for the political support he had
rendered mo in my last campaign; that all po
litical sores would be healed and the colonel
would be with me again this fall for the nomi
nation and election If I would only stand with
them on the ordinance they propose to intro
duce. I flatly refused to recede an inch from
my stand against the conducting of the pool
rooms in the city. I told them I would veto
any ordinance that permitted the selling of
pools in this city except on the racetrack dur
ing the races. This I have done and I call
your attention to the record of the poolroom or
dinances to sustain my statements. No matter
what they assert my statements and my record
prove each other. This cannot be denied.
In discussing the Ing ordinance I did not ask
that "may" be changed to "must," nor di'd I
agree to any proposition whatsoever whereby
poolrooms would be permitted to run. Ing in
troduced his ordinance, which provided for the
running of poolrooms at any place in the city
upon the payment of a license. Immediately
upon Its passage I vetoed It. It was passed
over my veto. Cavanaugh and Daroux applied
for a license to conduct a poolroom downtown.
Ing voted for It and Chief Sullivan and I voted
against It. Cavanaugh and Daroux then com
menced suit in the Superior Court to compel
me to give them a license. I instructed the
corporation counsel to contest that suit as
vigorously, as he could. He did so, and was
successful. . They never have obtained a license
and have never been able to open their pool
rooms.
Mayor Clark's statement deals in large
part with a reply to the charges made
yesterday In interviews with Daroux and
President Ing of the Board of Trustees re
specting his alleged insincerity in his anti
poolroom crusade. He asserts that Ing all
along stood in with the poolroom crowd.'
He declares he was induced to go to Cav
anaugh's house, on the night of the porch
incident, by a message that Cavanaugh
was sick and wanted to see him, and that
when he got there he was asked to sup
port the Ing ordinance providing for the
licensing- of poolrooms in any part of the
city. The Mayor continues:
Mayor Slaps at "Wright.
Cavanaugh says that President John C.
Ing of the Board of Trustees, who was
-present at the conference on the porch,
suspected that Clark "was getting some
thing out of it," and insisted that if
Clark wanted the poolrooms reopened he
should shoulder the entire blame. Cava
naugh then tells of the organization of the
Sacramento Club for the purpose of ap
plying for a license under the new ordi
nance, and declares that M. F. Rowland
was elected one of the directors therein to
represent Clark's interests, and that 25 per
cent of the capital stock was assigned to
him. Cavanaugh says that Clark was not
satisfied even with this concession, but
stipulated that he must have an agent in
the poolroom when it should be opened,
who would furnish him a statement each
day of the amount of business transacted.
Cavanaugh winds up his statement in
these words:
"If I have spoken falsely concerning
Mayor Clark I have committed a very
grave offense, for which I should be made
by him to answer in the courts for crim
inal libel."
Cavanaugh. in his statement, avers that
M. F. Rowland, Mayor Clark, and himself
had a conference as to how much percent
age of the poolroom business Mayor Clark
should have and that Clark demanded 25
per cent for himself and 10 per cent for
Rowland. . â¢
Cavanaugrh details the circumstances
of a meeting on the front porch of his
house on the Saturday night preceding the
Monday night when the existing ordin
ance on the poolroom question was pre
sented to the Board of Trustees. Cavan
augh says Mayor Clark had just been in
the pulpits of the city denouncing the
poolroom evil and insisting on its suppres
sion, and that he desired to be protected
by having the proposed license ordinance
so changed that when an application was
duly made to him he "must" issue a li
cense to the poolrooms instead of "may."
Cavanaugh Accuses Clark.
The oil land case appears to be hopeless
ly lost in the shuttle, and accounts of pro
ceedings therein in the face of the sensa
tion which the trial has developed are
about as interesting as a bound volume of
consular reports.
SACRAMENTO, April 26.â Although Su
perior Judge Hughes has announced that
he does not want to sit as referee in a
fight between political factions, but de
sires to learn something about the oil
land transaction, the warfare rages out
of court with augmented fury between
Mayor Clark on the one side and Frank
Daroux and B. W.. Cavanaugh on the
other. Charges," any one of which is
serious enough to be the subject of im
mediate investigation by the Grand Jury,
are being hurled with a delightful disre
gard for consequences and the row as it
stands is about as pretty a one as the
most exacting could wish for.
The important developments of to-day
wero a detailed arraignment of Mayor
Clark by his former political ally, B. W.
Cavanaugh; an offer to forfeit $1000 in gold
coin if the charges embraced in the tes
timony and published statements of Frank
Daroux and B. W. Cavanaugh against
Clark are shown to be false, and a caus
tic statement from Mayor Clark himself
in which he points .to his record as dis
proving the charges of his enemies, and at
the same time gives Colonel J. B. Wright
an additional rap. .

DOES. NOT DISAPPOINT.
The New IHscovery for Catarrh Seems
to Possess Remarkable
Merit.
A new catarrh cure has recently ap-
peared which so far as tested has been
remarkably successful In curing all forms
of catarrh, whether in the head, throat,
bronchial tubes, or in stomach and liver.
The remedy is in tablet form, pleasant
and convenient to take and no special
secrecy is maintained as to what It con-
tains, the tablet being a scientific combi-
nation of Guaiacol, Eucalyptol, Sanguina-
rla. Hydrastin and similar valuable and
harmless antiseptics.
This safe and effective catarrh cure may
be found at any drug store under name
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
Whether the catarrh .is located In the
nose throat, bronchial tubes or stomach,
the tablets seem to act with equal suc-
cess removing the stuffy feeling In head
and nose, clearing the mucous membrane
of throat and trachae from catarrhal se-
cretions . which caus<Â» the tickling, cough-
ing haw-king and gagging so annoying to
every catarrh sufferer.
Nasal catarrh generally leads to ulcera-
tlon in Borne cases to such an extent as
to destroy the nose entirely and in many
old caÂ«Â»es of catarrh the bones of the head
heroine diseased. Nasal catarrh gradually
extends to the throat and bronchial tubes
arid very often to the stomach, causing
that Very obstinate trouble, catarrh of
the stomach.
Catarrh is a systemic poison, inherent in
the blood, and local washes, douches,
salves, Inhalers and sprays can have no
effect on the real cause of the disease.
An internal remedy which acts upon tho
blood is the only rational treatment, and
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is the safest of
all internal remedies, as well ns the most
convenient and satisfactory from a medl-
cai Â°tandpoint.
Dr Eaton recently stated that he had
successfully used Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets In old chronic cases, even where ul-
ceration had extended so far as to destroy
the septum of the nose. He says: "I am
pleasantly surprised almost every day
by the excellent results from Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets. It Is remarkable how
effectually they remove the excessive se-
cretion and bring about a healthy condi-
tion of the mucous membranes of the
nose, throat and stomach."
All druggists sell complete treatment of
the tablets at 50 cents, and a little book
giving the symptoms and causes of the
various forms of catarrh will be mailed
free by addressing F. A. Stuart Co., Mar-
shall. 'Mich. Â¦ â¢ a

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
Captains of vessels just home from the
islands say that never in the history of
Honolulu : have they seen so many idle
sailors on the beach. Every vessel that
reaches Hawaii loses from three to six
of her crew, and these join the band that
is living- a lotus life. They . sleep under
trees or in the open and the balmy breezes
of the sub-tropical land only lulls them
into a sounder slumber. Bananas and
bread fruit are to be had for the asking,
and fish are there for whoever will catch
them. As long as this state of affairs
lasts "Jack" will not go to sea, and in
consequence many a stout ship has to
come home short-handed. "The men are
getting to be regular beach-combers," said
a captain yesterday, "and if something
does not turn up to drive them to sea
soon, they will be lost to the American
merchant marine." _

pÂ»yiÂ«^ HE members of the San Francisco
II Yacht Club are jubilant over the
I plans for the new cup challenger
jj, furnishes them by Crownshield of
Boston. The great yacht designer
has sent them a. model of a thirty-footer
which, the yachtsmen believe, will bring
the cup back to its old abiding place.
The challenge cup was paid for with
money subscribed by all the yacht clubs
around the bay. "When finished it was
given into the custody of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, that being the senior
organization. The Encinal Yacht Club at
once challenged with the El Suano and the
San Franciscos defended with the Queen.
The El Suano won. Next year the San
Franciscos challenged with the Catherine
and the Encinals defended with the
Fawn. The Fawn won. Then the Corin
thian Yacht Club challenged with the
Aeolus and the Enclnals again put for
ward the Fawn. The Aeolus won.
For two years after the victory of the
Aeolus there was no contest, and then the
San Franciscos challenged with the Gad
der and the Corinthians defended with the
Truant. The Gadder won. The Aeolus
was put into commission again last year
and the Corinthians challenged with her
and again took tho cup away from the
San Franciscos, beating the Gadder easily.
It was after this defeat that "\V. X. Mc-
Carthy, John Savorv, "\V. W. Morrow and
T. L. Hill of the San Francisco Yacht
Club put their heads together and deter
mined to build a yacht that would keep
the cup in the club's possession for several
years to come. An order was sent to
Crownshield, and the model and plans
are now here. The new boat will be of
the fin-keel type and will have a regular
spoon-bill bow. She will be 42 feet over
all. 10 feet 3 inches beam and 7 feet deep.
The racing length of the Aeolus is 28 feet
10 Inches and that of the new challenger
wHl be a few Inches more.
It was originally the intention of the
California Yacht Club to challenge with
the Jessie E and the Vallejo Yacht Club
to challenge with a new yacht now build
ing at Benicia for Vice Commodore Chap
man. When these gentlemen heard of the
San Francisco Yacht Club's new chal
lenger they at once withdrew, so the
Corinthians and San Franciscos will fight
it out once more.
EAN JOSE, April 26.â After twenty
years of waiting, during which he tena
ciously retained mining claims Â¦which
others declared worthless and labored
with team and shovel on. the streets of
the city to support himself and family,
luartln Ford, a well known resident of
San Jose, Is to receive a quarter of a mil
lion dollars for the property and in his old
age will be placed beyond the need of toil,
ford always declared that he would yet
realize a lortune from the mines, but his
friends ridiculed the idea, and it Is doubt
lul that he could have realized anything
on Ins holdings up to within a short time
ego. Now he is in Gruss Valley, where
the property is located, talking of thou
sands of dollars and closing negotiations
for its sale to a syndicate of Montana
capitalists, composed of \V. A. Clark Jr.
and Charles Clark, sons of United States
Senator Clark, and Miles .Finley of Butte,
Mont. A bond has been given and a sale
is almost certain to go through. The
price is said to be. $250,wJ.
Twenty years ago ilartin Ford con
ducted a general merchandise store ln
Nevada City. At that time the place was
prosperous and he had considerable
mency. In his transactions with miners
lie came into possession of several claims,
covering about sixty-five acres. He had
done some prospecting work and was
convinced his claims were rich. About
this time the little mining town suffered
a setback and was almost deserted. He
was obliged to stop work on his claims,
and in order to make a livine was com
pelled to leave Nevada County.
Ford came to San Jose ar.d bought a
home here and for years has worked on
Lhe streets with team and spade. Small
sums had been offered' for the claims
from time to time, but these he refused,
declaring lie would yet realize his thou-
Fsnds.
Waiting became discouraging, and a
fen- months ago he told C. M. Wooster', a
real estate dealer, that he would like to
sell his mines and would take $100,000 for
them. Wooster laid the matter before
some men in San Francisco, and the
< "larks of Montana became interested.
They began an investigation and had as
says made, which proved up ?450 to the
ten in free milling gold. The claims
fcbeut to be sold are said to be the Frank
lin, the Ford and the Irish-American and
others.

.Annie M. .Loggiejwas granted a divorce
'.from James ; J. Log&ie yesterday, on the
'ground of. extreme cruelty. Suits, for di
vorce were filed yesterday by Henry Op
enheim against Jennie, Openheim for de
sertion; Charles A.: Storey against Minnie
Storey for desertion: Lottie E. Hill against
Fred C. Hill, for desertion, and AdaiL.
Forsyth against John W. Forsyth fpr cru
elty. Ella J. Carpenter has sued Anthony
G.: Carpenter to annul their marriage.
In the Divorce Court.
The basis of the claim that the Asles
sor and County Clerk are both municipal
officers is that the charter expressly im
poses upon them municipal duties and
functions; that they are so by virtue of.
sections 7 and 8 of article XI of the con
stitution,, and that the rule laid. down in
the decision in' Kahn vs. â.Sutro estab
lished the fact. " .. ..
On the- point that concerns the civil
service law Mr. Clement argues that the
question now before the court is an open
one, not ' having been determined in the
case of Kahn vs.Sutro.or in any other
case in this State where the issue In this
case was directly involved; that Kahn
vs Sutro is perfectly reconcilable with
the contention that â¢ he makes â that the
civil service law in the charter Is binding
upon county officers as weir as city offi
cers; that the decision in Kahn vs Sutro
that the city of San Francisco was a mu
nicipal corporation, a . city and not- a
county, under the consolidation act,; and
that the county government act applied
to the county officers in San Francisco to
the extent of -determining their term3 of
office is not inconsistent with'or-irrecon
cilable with the . contention that a free
holders' charter, . drawn under sections 7
and 8 of article XI of the constitution,
may prescribe the mere administrative
manner that county I officers .shall dis
charge their local, duties under the gen
eral law of. the State. Â¦ , - â¢. - . .
Mr. Clement appears, bo he states, in his
petition, as amicus curiae solely for him
self and on behalf of many citizens who
agree with him, and not "as representing
persons addicted to shallow denunciation
of decisions that do not suit them." Â¦
Henry N. Clement, who was a member
of the . Board of j Freeholders which
framed. the present charter of San' Fran
cisco, has filed a petition for a rehearing
In the Supreme Court of the State of the
caso of Timothy J. Crowley vs. J. Rich
ard Freud .et al. In his petition Mr.
Clement sets- forth that he will rely on
two points, which are that the offices of
Assessor and County Clerk are both mu
nicipal offices; and that the civil service
law embodied, in the charter is a mere
local regulation, prescribing the adminis
trative manner in which the officers of
the city and county shall discharge their
duties, whether emanating from the char
ter or general law, and as such is au
thorized in and by sections 7 and 8, arti
cle XI, of the State constitution.
Freeholder Clement Asks
Supreme Court to
Rehear.

: Mr. Boardman asked for a continuance
on the plea that he had had no time in
which to make up a defense. MrV Wood
worth opposed any continuance, but Judge-
Heacock said that as all the Chinese slave
cases had been set for, trial for definite
dates and with the understanding that no
.further cotinuances would be asked for
or granted he adjourned the examination
until 10 o'clock this morning. ,-
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the case
of another girl slave, Lee Ah Yin, was
taken up. Dr. Gardner testified that he
identified her as a girl who had arrived
here on the Rio on March SO, 1897. After
her arrest last Saturday ' she told him
that she was the same, girl and that she
had been an inmate 'of a house in Sulli
van alley for a longtime, and that she
had not been registered. â¢ . . .
When the case was called yesterday
morning on the continuance Mr. . Board
man was not present, and an affidavit
was presented to the court certifying that
he was engaged in a case in the Superior
Court and could not attend Judge Hea
ccck's court. United States District At
torney Woodworth protested- against any
continuance and the investigation pro
ceeded -without Mr. Boardman. Â¦
The G-overnment gained a signal victory
yesterday, when United States Court
Commissioner Heacock ordered the de
portation of Jeung Jung Ho, one of the
eighteen, Chinese slave girls captured by
the Federal posse in Sullivan alley last
Saturday. Louis P. Boardman, her at
torney, made the defense that she was a
native of â¢ San Francisco and had never
been out of the city. But this defense was
demolished by the testimony of Dr. John
Endicott Gardner, Chinese inspector and
interpreter, .who identified the .woman as
a girl who had come from China on the
steamer China in 1897. . /.
Liu Kum, a Chinese Christian girl, tes
tified that she came to this country on the
China in 1897 with Jeung Jung Ho and
knew her well. -

The ship owners do not object very
strcngly to the scale of wages, although
the wages on vessels of the sugar rleet
have been advanced from $35 to S40 a
month and overtime on steam schooners
frcm 40 to 50 cents an hour. These differ
ences will probably be amicably adjusted.
The rock on which the unions and the
ship owners will probably strike is clause
7 No ship owner will enter into an agree
ment for a year, nor will he put his signa
ture to any such document. â¢ The sting
lies, however, in the paragraph:
"This agreement shall be considered as
violated whenever the seamen or firemen
are requested to work with* non-union
men, or to accent freight from or deliver
carco to non-union men."
In other words, every carter who brings
a load to a ship's side must be a union
man- every person, be he longshoreman
or BT een hand,' who assists. in loading or
unloading a vessel must be a union man;
all repairs to a vessel, whether machinery
or hull must be done by union men: the
bedding must be washed by union labor,
and the meals must be prepared by a
ur.ion cook or else there may be a gen
eral strike. In fact, the whole thing
amounts to simply . thisâ every vessel
owned or controlled In San Francisco
ntiust be unionized. ... "- ,â
Two other points the ship owners will
not concede are the nine-hour workday
and the GO-cent board money. The lat
ter may be conceded, but the nine-hour
dav wlil be hard of adjustment. ;
The committee appointed by the ship
owners will talk the whole matter over
with the joint committee appointed by
the unions and then both will report back
-to their organizations. Messrs.. . .;

Where the Danger Lies.
THE Odd Fellows of San Francisco
and of Alameda County celebrated
the eighty-second anniversary of
the institution of Odd Fellowship
in the United States with a picnic
yesterday at Fernbrook Park, in Niles
Canyon. The contingent from this city
left the mole in a special train of four
teen cars and this was followed by an
other train from Oakland, the two carry-
Ins about 1200 excursionists. . .
j Fidelity Lodge of San Francisco had
two cars reserved for its members and
friends and .these were decorated with
evergreens and flowers. The park was
reached after a ride of an .hour and a
half and in a few moments nearly all
were busy, discussing lunch. Then music
attracted the lovers of dancing to the pa-
Villon .until the time fixed for the confer
ring of the decoration of chivalry on three
candidates. There was a procession of
those who were to take part in the cere
mony. First came Brigadier General H.
O. Brower, escorting little Jessie Harris,
the maid of horlor; Miss Jennie. Wright,
Mrs. Alma Isabella .Jensen, Mrs. Lizzie
Stanton and Mrs. /H. E. Beckley, San

with their escorts in full uniform, one of
these being Sergeant Martin Mertenson
of Company F, Thirty-sixth United States
Volunteers; San Francisco Canton No. 5,
Patriarchs Militant, Captain C. H. Korn

These cantons in their very attractive
uniforms presented a soldlftrly appear

escort of Captain Kornbeck, who, leading
them to a stand on which there was a
bowl of water, informed them that if they
would advance in the degTee they must
do so with clean hands, and bade them
â¢wash them, which they did. They were
then presented to the brigadier general,
who, after requesting, them to kneel, ad
ministered a solemn obligation to them
and reminded them that they were about
to be rewarded for continuous and meri
torious service in the cause, of Odd Fel
lowship. . . Â¦
All of' the evidence introduced during
the trial was .carefully analyzed by Mr.
Pillsbury, after which an adjournment
was taken Until this morning..
After- dwelling at length on the person
ality of Philbrook and the character and
integrity of those whom he had assailed,
Mr. Pillsbury, turned to the evidence. He
discussed the contract exacted by Phil
brook from the Levinson heirs he repre
sented, by the terms of which, had the
action instituted by him been successful,
the heirs would have come into posses
sion of about $10,000 and Philbrook would
have been enriched in the sum of between
$110,000 and $130,000. :
"And .when defeated in this action,"
said Mr. Pillsbury, "he wrote the: brief
for which he was disbarred. And it ts
evidence in this case, that some days.be
fore that brief Â«vas fll^d -with the- ijSupr.eme
Court it was placed in the hands^of -the
attorneys who opposed him and whom he
attacked in the brief, that if they saw
fit to prevent these charges being filed
among the public records they could make
a' monetary settlement with their tradu
cer. But they did not see fit ,to settle
with Philbrook -and the brief was filed,
and for the contemptuous language it con
tained he was disbarred."
Analyzes the Defense.
"Philbrook," said Pillsbury, ."is in my
opinion, incapable of .reasoning in accord
ance with sound and . established princi
ples. Every â¢; condition â¢ that exists If op
posed to a condition advocated -by him is
straightway accepted as corrupt. And he
cares not at whom he aims his venomous
shafts. Of air the attacks which he has
made, there was none less justified than
that directed against Judge Coffay. If
'there Is a man who is above "suspicion,
whose eighteen ; years on the bench have
been passed without a cloud of suspicion
against him. It is Judge Coffey,- and I
dare say that if this plaintiff were to
leave this courtroom and make the
charges against Judge Coffey which hÂ«
has- made in this court under the guise
that they were material to the issues at
bar.- there would be some one who would
hold him personally responsible and pun
ish him for his falsehood."
When Philbrook had concluded his open
ing argument, E. S. Pillsbury. represent
ing .Judge Paterson, rose and addressed
the ' jury. r His analysis of Phllbrook'a
character I was elaborate. He said that
though Supreme Court Justice; Henshaw
had .characterized Philbrook as the most
malignant, .evil-minded, man Mm earth,
there .was another element in his mental
construction that was apparent.
Pillsbury Argues. for Defense.
Philbrook opened his argument when
court convened for the afternoon sitting.
He frequently attacked the veracity of
Judge Paterson and the majority of those
Â¦who supported. him. Again he would com
pare himself to men who have become
illustrious through their genius and val
iant deeds and pointed out "that oft
times ' persecution j was . the reward of
righteousness." Â¦
Philbrook then took the stand in rebut
tal and swore that he -was never greatly
excited; that he never walked the streets
talking: incoherently and gazing- up into
the heavens; as. alleged by Judge Pater
son, who was .corroborated by Attorney
J. C, Campbell and other witnesses. Mrs.
Philbrook also testified in behalf of her
husband, after which the case rested.
Robert Y.7. Hayne, J. â¢ W. Goodwin,
Charles W. Slack and George E. Jackson
were called in behalf of the j defendant
yesterday morning.. Their evidence con
tradicted statements made by Philbroolt
during: thft. trial.
This afternoon the jury Impaneled to
try the action instituted by Horace W.
Philbrook against Van R. Paterson will
determine whether or not the plaintiff Is
entitled to judgment for $100,000 damages,
which he demands, or any other sum. j

If the reader has ever failed to make
Postum satisfactorily, it will be found
that to allow it to boll 15 minutes after
boiling commences will solve the prob-
lem, as !t must be so boiled to extract
taste, color and food value. It Is the only
original Food Coffee with- a- pleasant
coffee flavor. Many imitations of Post-
um are now upon the market. The only
palatable ones thus far tested prove to
be made of a low grade of coffee, and
some other articles, notwithstanding the
loud claims that they are "pure." â¢'â¢ "'
Postum aids digestion without drug-
ping, and furnishes a concentrated liquid
food. as well aus a most delicious morning
Coffee.
Why does the dismissal of Coffee and
the use of Postum bring help? Experi-
ments In artificial digestion show clearly
to the scientific investigator that coffee
arrests digestion, and, according to one
authority, allows only 61 per cent of the
food to be digested. That strikes at the
very keystone to the arch of health.
Failure in digestion means lack of good
blood, and therefore a lack of food for
the nerve centers. As the nerves control
the organs of the entire body, one can
readily understand that a disorganized
nervous eystcm may show effect in any
part of the body. Therefore, a removal
of the cause will allow nature to right
herself. A powerful assistant to nature
is Postum Cereal Food Coffee, composed
of the albumen, phosphates, gluten, etc.,
from which nature builds In the delicate
tissues of the nerves.
Look carefully Into the state of health
of the Individual who knows that "coffee
don't hurt me," and you are almost sure
to find some form of physical all or func-
tional disturbanceâ perhaps muddy com-
plexion, or weak eyes. Incipient heart
failure, kidney trouble, liver or bowel
disorders, cr come form of weakness that
fhotvs plainly enough by the cry for re-
lief eent up from some organ of the body.
Some famous brain workers have made
a welcome discovery along the line of re-
covery of health by the proper selection
of fo9<3. Several were of the "Coffee-
never-hurt-me" kind, but, as an experi-
ment, tried leaving it off ten days, and
the use of Postum Cereal Food Coffee In
Its place. A definite and decided im-
provement in health Is practically certain
to attend such a change.

had read of Lydia E. Pinkham's Com-

I wrote toMrs. Pinkham, and received
a very nice letter in return. I began
at once the use of her Vegetable Com-

orufi fcr a full week's business. On Monday
of this week the sales of all stocks reached
an aggregate of 2.3S2.530 shares, exceeding by
seveial hundred thousand shares the previous
record for one day's business. On three out of
the five days this week the pales have ex
ceeded two million shares. On Wednesday
the pales of Â¦ Union Pacific alone were 062.800

The statement of these facts gives an idea
of Â«he immense speculation in 6tocks. but it
ccnvi-ys only a Â»".ight Idea of- the state of
leverish excitement among speculators. The
fpsculation has been decidedly nervous at
tir.iec, owing to the sharp breaks In prices of
fine of the most active stocks. Trie failure
of the general market on Wednesday to re
spond to the phenomenal strength and con
tinued demand for Union Pacific, especially
caused uneasiness and a dread lest the power
ful pools of millionaires who have been cred
ited with the leadership of the bull market
had been selling their holdings under cover of
the movement in Union Pacific to take their
profits, but the buying on recessiens was so
constantly renewed and the market's ab
porptlvÂ« power proved so powerful that the
e>sire to sell was checked and the prices
t'irned upward with th? result that hear cper
etors who had 6old short early in the week
were driven to cover and their urgent demand
helped prices on the rebound. The principal
caufe of the occasional disquietude in the
market was the fear of Impairment of money
market resources, -which might restrict the
liberal credits which are the fostering cause
of the continued speculative buying. When it
became known that subscriptions Were in
vited In New York to the new issue of British
consols and were being received on a large
scale and when announcements were made c,t
rold exports, the fear was engendered that in
roads upon banking reserves thus threatened
would before long force bankers to call loans
to protect their surplus. There was. in fact,
a good deal of calling of loans by banks early
in the week, which was offset by large effer
ingre on account of . interior banking institu
tions. These offerings might either be the
cause or the effect of the calling of loans by
New York banks. The higher money rate is
the attraction for Interior banks to lend
rnorey on the stock exchange, but they draw
'on their New York deposits for the funds.
The loans thus placed may be redeposited in
ut bank, but tlie effect is to necessitate the
NEW YORK. Ap'.rl 26.â To-day's stock mar
kft was decidedly mo'c quiet and orderly than
in any day during the week. There were a
few stocks which showed positive strength
practically witnout interruption all day and
ther? were no points of acute weakness nor
eny period of a general disposition to sell, ex
rept fcr the opening dip in Amalgamated Cop
r*r and American Sn:elting. due to the legal
measures taken to frustrate the absorption of
other properties contemplated by those com
panies. Owing to to-morrow's holiday on ac
count of the removal of the boardroom ap
paratus from the present building to the tem
rÂ»oraiy quarters in the Produce Exchange
there was a disposition to curtail speculative
ventures and to close up accounts. From the
firm trr.dency of the market it looked as
though the bears wore the ones who were most
inclined to cover their contracts. The bulls
v.-*re net aggressive, out their attacks seemed
crsipn^d either to protect the market or hold
pricts firm. There was some confusion about
the b- ardroom owing to the preparations for
t:ie moving and this in itself had the effect
of Jpsseniiig the trading. The principal strength
in the market persisted in about the same
quarters as for some time past, namely, in
tlie grangers and Pacifies. Northern Pacific
was moit largely deait in and rose an ex
treme %, but Burlington advanced 2Vi to a
if-cord price. Rock Island rose 2% and North
western 4*4. Pennpyhania, selling ex rights
and Baltimore and Ohio continued strong.
I'nion Pacific was not as active as on previous
days of tlie week and there was large realiz
ing going on in it all day. but the stock was
held above last night during the greater part
Ot the <Jay, although it closed a shade off.
Among the specialties Sugar rose 3%, Tobacco
2%, Colorado Fuel 3Vs, General Electric 3*4,
New Ycrk Air Crake 10 points and a number
cf other specialties from 1 to 2 points. The
O^lorado and Southern stocks were notably
rtrong at advances of Z-*<a2\~i. The confidence
that to-nicrrow's bank statement will make a
ttronjt shoeing ftad much to do with sustain
ing the market. The leceipts of cash from
the ir.tvrior hav<Â» offset to a large extent the
absorption by the sub-treasury including the
liaymfnts for the goIJ exported so that It is
expected that the l-ai.ks will not lose more
than half a million dollars on the week on all
accounts. Next week the money market will
I'-avc the benefit of the payment of the May 1
interest. which amounts to about $2,500,000.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Wool is fairly steady, and this is the best
that can be said. Eastern markets are quiet
with light demand from the mills, c There is
less disposition to secure raw material in ad
vance on needs, although much faith is ex
pressed regarding the stability of prices. Re
ports from- many correspondents In the chief
sheep raising States indicate that a larger
clip than last year may be expected and that
the conditions are satisfactory. Gre-wers are
slow to make contracts at the present level
of prices, but a large percentage of the old
crop carried over and heavy stocks at the
East give little encouragement to hope for
higher prices until demand for manufactured
good3 shows material improvement. '
Failures for the week" number 215 in the
United States, against 204 last year, and 26
in Canada, against 22 last year.
After a prolonged period of waiting for defi
nite crop news the cereal markets suddenly
awoke to unusual activity. Much of the In
creased trading and sharp advance in . prices
resulted from clever manipulation by a single
Western speculator, who compelled the short
contingent to cover May corn contracts at the
highest prices of the season. Wheat has risen
sharply, partly in sympathy with corn, but
there was bad news regarding- ' the German
crop and some damage occurred at the -"West.
NEW TORK, April 26.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade -to-morrow will say:
Business continues brisk for the season in the
face of some drawbacks, which at times might
cause marked hesitation. Chief these is the
floods in many directions,- which have inter
fered with railroad operations and interrupt
ed the distribution of merchandise, and the
weather all over the East has been adverse
to an increase of retail trade. - Bank clear
ings, however, show that while speculation
has been heavy there must have been a well
sustained volume of legitimate business. Rail
road earnings make encouraging gains. Re
ports from the interior show special strength
in conditions through Missouri, Kansas and
Ohio, and the future Is full of promise, unless
there is misfortune with the crops.
Much unfavorable comment has appeared
regarding the advance in steel rails to ?28.
Yet the change is only in keeping with re
cent increases in prices of piglron and billets.
Nominal quotations for many products of iron
and steel have long been disregarded in con
tracts calling for early delivery, and list
prices are generally moving up to a repre
sentative level. On new business or export or
ders it is not unreasonable to make prices for.

shifting of loans, which has a disturbing Â«f
i feet. The falling off in the offerings of bonds
for redemption at the subtreasury and in the
payment by that institution on account of pen
sions resulted In a renewed absorption by it
of money from the market and was an addi
tional factor In the disposition of caution. The
call money rate eased off in the course of the
xveek. however, and -uieted any apprehension
on that score. It is the belief among the
speculators for the rise that the syndicates
and capitalists concerned in the railroad con
solidations and the steel merger are prepared
to protect the money market - against strin
gency by the release of funds from the heavy
borrowings made incident to their operations.
From December 22 last to March 9. this year,
the loans of the New Tork banks had ex
panded $131,690,900. This was the period of the
formatiQn of the principal syndicates having
to do with the operations toward consolida
tions among the anthracite railroads, the
Southern Pacific, the steel merger and other
transactions in furtherance of the "community t
of interest" policy. The success of these
transactions and of those which grew out of
them gave the great impetus to the specula
tion which has retained Its force ever since
and grave a strong market for the flotation of
the new securities which, were Issued to rtim-'
burse the expense of the various purchase
Involved. As these new securities were issued
from time to time and are still being issued,
the support which Is given them In the mar
ket by their powerful sponsors affords a sus
taining force to the whole market. The past
week's speculation really had no fresh news to
further it. But former rumors of a South
western railroad merger and of plans to offset
the Burlington deal by other Pacific and
granger railroads restrained all their force.
The firmness of Burlington on the formal an
nouncement of the terms of the deal when a
certain amount of speculative liquidation
might have been expected, has added to the
confidence in the stability of other stocks
which have risen in price.
The demand for railroad bonds has been
most marked in securities of the same com
panies whose stocks have been prominent in
the dealings, notably Tjnlon Pacific.

1 ' NEW YORK,' April 26.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: While adversely affected by un
favorable weather conditions, general trade
manifests a strong underlying tone, which
seemingly lacks only the advent of better
weather to become buoyant. Cold weather has
undoubtedly affected planting and germina
tion in some sectiftns, . but the probable dam
age to crops Is not so great, as earlier "ad
vices appeared to indicate. In some direc
tions activity was pronounced, as for exam
ple in iron and steel, where apparently produc
tion is taxed to Its utmost capacity, though
seemingly more to meet ! spring requirements
than because of new orders. .
A stiffening in prices is noted in lumber,
with a demand fully up to the supply. From
Portland. Or., comes the report that the log
ging camps are ( taxed to . supply orders.
There Is little alteration in hides.
Activity on an enormous scale continues to
rule In the New York stock market. Early
this week irregularity, with some heavy sell
ing and declines prevailed, due to renewed
gold . shipments, caused by large subscriptions
here, aggregating $150,000,000 to the new Brit
ish war loan. Money rates failing .to harden,
bullish speculative sentiment resumed control.
The formal announcement of the Burlington
deal gave rise to further notable advances,
particularly in Union Pacific, rumors circulat
ing that it would be leased to another system.
Northern Pacific, Baltimore and Ohio, Mis
souri Pacific and St. Paul have all shown
great strength, an idea prevailing that the
price of $20 raid for Burlington's control gets
a new level of values for stocks of its class.
Buyers show a disposition In wool to wait
until the new wools come in. Leather" shows
more activity on what sustained prices. Small
business in boots and shoes of i the better
grades are reported favorable and prices are
said to be steady. - ' â¢ - Â¦

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Brisk business was done on the Stock . Ex
change to-day. -The tone was cheerful.' The
American department had quieted down and
there were fewer fireworks to-day than on any
day for some time. Prices were hard until
New York sent over selling orders supposed
to be in anticipation of the holiday to-morrow.
The closing of the Stock Exchange in Nfcw
York will give London- the first chance to act
upon the bank statement. The Baltimore and
Ohio led in the trading. Other features were
Missouri, Kansas and Texas and Denver and
Rio Grande, which were strong on the an
nouncement of the election of Mr. Gould as
president of the Denver road. In Union Pa
cific there was a disposition to take profits.
All of these stocks, however, were eclipsed in
the trading by the shares of the United States
Steel Corporation, which made a record. The
volume of trading in them was- far beyond
anything seen in these stocks since their . in
troduction here. The preferred, which London
favors, were especially strong and active. Ap
plication has been made for official quotations
of them upon the Stock Exchange, bo London
sees that these stocks have come here to stay.

and the demand Is nothing extra. Cheese Is
rather weak, as arrivals are liberal, but prices
are unchanged.
There are plenty of Eggs on the market, and
stocks are slowly increasing. Still, dealers In

SUIXIVAN HELD ON
CABANISS FORGERY
On being told that he was wanted for
forgery Ruscher loudly proclaimed his
innocence.' He was taken to the City
Prison and booked on two charges of
forgery. Ruscher claimed that he arrived
here from' Philadelphia about seven
months ago and- has since been tending
bar in a water front saloon.
CiuJT Brothers, wholesale grocers, are
also victims of the clever forger to the
extent of $65 75, the amount of a' check to
which the name of G.' F. Krueger had
been forged. . Â»'.
As soon as the forgeries were discov
ered Ruscher' s victims lost no time in
notifying Captain Seymour, and Detec
tives Mahon and Reynolds were put on his
track, but it was not until yesterday that
they succeeded in getting a clew -to his
whereabouts. Accompanied by two em
ployes of the Jackson brewery the detec
tives went to Tanforan yesterday after
noon and located Ruscher.
By the arrest of Edward Ruscher, a tall,
well dressed man, yesterday, Captain
Seymour believes he has captured the
clever forger who has been passing bogus
checks on various local breweries.
Last Monday Ruscher visited the Jack
son" brewery and presented a check for
$75 50, drawn in favor of Charles A. War
ren, the contractor, and purporting to
have been signed by E. T. Kruse. â¢ As the
check bore the indorsement of A. P.
Bellue, who is a customer of the brewery,
the cashier had no suspicion of anything
wrong. Ruscher at the time was without
his hat or coat and the brewery people
thinking that he had been sent by Bel
lue, who conducts a store near by, read
ily cashed the check.
The same day Ruscher visited the HI
bernia Brewery and presented a check
for $75 50 drawn in favor of Charles A.
Warren and bearing the forged signature
of Mr. Kruse. The check purported to
have been indorsed by A. H. Cusens, who
is well known to the manager of the
brewery. Ruscher was without hat and
coat and in explanation of his appearance
he said that Mr. Cusen had sent him post
haste to cash the check. Unsuspicious,
the cashier promptly honored the check.
The following day Ruscher imposed on the
cashier of the Enterprise brewery in a
similar manner, securing $75.

another husband living, one Bernard
Freimann of London, was the first to un
burden her soul on the marriage record
Issue. She confessed to three entaYigle
ments which had carried her as far as
that bourne whence no traveler returns
save through the divorce court. Mrs.
Cadderly had returned safely on each oc
casion. One of her fellow travelers was
the same Freimann who afterward mar
ried the present Mrs. Maristany. Hence
her connection with the present hostili
ties. She denied a charge by the opposi
tion that a habit she had of throwing
champagne bottles through the front win
dows of Freimann's restaurant drove him
into bankruptcy and divorce.
Then the other side, not liking the im
putations cast upon its witness, intimated
that there were others present with mari
tal histories. Delving from one titular
stratum to .another, they exhibited to
the court no less than six surnames
worn at different periods by Mrs. Maris
tany,' accomplished by five weddings,
three divorces and one desertion. Then
it came out that Freimann, after leaving
his wife, now Mrs. Maristany, has mar
ried again -in England. Maristany him
self was next held up and the searchlight
turned upon his conjugal relations. Not
to be outdone by the woman with whom
he unwillingly shares his name, he showed
he was as much married as she, namely,
five times. ,
Aghast at the matrimonial wreckage
trailing in the wake of their inquiry, the
attorneys dropped the subject by, mutual
consent, leaving the records of several
others of the persons Involved untouched.

spout last Saturday. The spout was first
seen when the vessel was in lati

and was about three miles to leeward,

The acquirement of the Burlington sys
tem by the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern railroads is practically accom
plished, negotiations for "community of
ownership" of the Northwestern and
Union Pacific are said to be progressing 1
satisfactorily, plans for the extension of
the Gould systems are rapidly being car
ried out and things generally are work
ing so well that the announcement has
been made that the presidents of the
Western railroads will meet In New Tork
in June. At that meeting a traffic pool will
be formed if possible. The call for the
meeting of "Western presidents in New
York next week has been withdrawn sim
ultaneously with the announcement that
the meeting will be held in June.
Much surprise has been occasioned by
the postponement from month to month
since last February of a meeting In New
York of the presidents and the leading
traffic officials of the "Western roads. It
has just become known that the real rea
son for the postponements was the delay
in perfecting many big railway consoli
dation schemes that were regarded as
necessary to the formation of the hugo
traffic pool contemplated.
CHICAGO, April 26.â The presidents of
the "Western railroads are preparing to i
form the biggest traffic pool ever pro
posed. All the roads west . of the line
drawn from Chicago to New Orleans will
be Included In the agreement If the plana^
of the holders of financial control of the
most important systems can be carried
out.

RAILROAD POOL
NOW SCHEDULED
On the Kentucky side from Covington
through Newport, Bellevue and Dayton,
the situation is equally distressing; Thou
sands are out of work here and up the
valley, but most of them will resume
Monday. Among those closing tn-day
were the lower shops of the Kay & Egan
Company, rendering 500 men idle, 'i'he
street railways are still crippled, but tho
steam railways are running all passenger
trains as usual and they expect to be
ready to handle freight at all stations on
Monday.
Favorable weather is reported through
the Ohio Valley. Many sick from inun
dated houses have arrived at hospitals.
Relief committeea have been organized at
many places above Cincinnati where there
if. distress. It is estimated that 500 resi
dences have been inundated in the east
end of Cincinnati ami more on the west
side along Mill Creek Valley. These do
not include the flooded districts along the
frontage of the Ohio River, where tene
ment houses as well as business interests
suffered.
At Ripley, Ohio, tile Inundation is so
bad to-night that ali business is suspend
ed. From Main street to East Ripley
everything is under water. At Ports
mouth, Ohio, a rise In the Scitio River
has made the situation worse in the
northern part of that city. Over 2000 peo
ple have been driven from their homes in
the Portsmouth district.
At Bellevue, Ky., Just across the river
from the eastern part of Cincinnati, a
large Indignation meeting was held to
night because the Cincinnati. Covington
and Newport Street Railway did not fur
nish boats for transfers at all the flooded
points. The street railway claims that
boats are in such demand that they could
not be had at all places where the water
was over the track.-;. Later a crowd of
indignant people tore up the tracks for
some distance in the more elevated parts
of the town.
CINCINNATI. April 26.â The Ohio River
has been stationary here and for some
distance below Cincinnati since 9 o'clock
this morning. Local Forecast Official
Bassler said to-nij?::t: "I look for the
river to remain stationary until to-mor
row morning, when there may be a per
ceptible fall."

SAX JOSE, April 26.â "VV. W. Allen, ex
secretary cf the Diamond Oil Company,
U in Texas. He left on the 17th Inst. in
the interest of San Jose capitalists, who
are buying oil lands. He will not return
for seme time.
An attorney who represents the com
pany that has employed Allen stated this
Â«-ven'.r>g that he knew Allen was not short
in hif. accounts, He had heard the story
to that effect and investigated the matter
before Allen was employed by the com
pany here. According to him AHen was
forced from the secretaryship of the Dia
mond Oil Company to make room for his
ruccesFor by W. O. Hilbisch and Dr.
Spcncgle. After Allen resigned his books
were experted by two men. One was in
the interest of Hilbisch and others by
Exoert Jenkins and the other in the in
terest of advisory directors and stock
holders by Expert Benkert. Both showed
his accounts were correct, and thÂ« lat
ter's report was a sworn statement. Ben
kert's report was made because of a
statement circulated that there was an
overissue of stock.
Ex -Secretary Allen in Texas.
Experts are endeavoring to unravel the
intricacies of the system of accounts kept
by IV. W. Allen as secretary of the Dia
mond Oil Company. They ,are of the
opinion that in some way the company is
short cf moneys it should have received,
\ha amount of which is variously esti
mated at from J8000 to 510.000. Where this
p. mount has gone no one connected with
i he company geems to know. None of
the officers are willing to talk about the
matter.
The resignation of the secretary was
rÂ«-celved gladly, and Elnce his departure
there has been something of a reorganiza
tion, W. O. Hilbisch being made the man
ager. He and Dr. Charles O. Sponcgle
ere the principal holders of stock in the
company. Various stories have been
Klven currency by stockholders. From
these it appears there, was a lively close
10 Allen's engagement, in which HH-
I'ifch and AHen had a hot mixup in the
1'arrott building, with the result that
J hilbisch came out victorious.
When Hilbisch was asked yesterday
about the attair he declined to say any
thing concerning it. Dr. Sponogle also
<* dined to give any information. All
they would vouchsafe was that no action,
criminal or civil, has been brought as yet
against any one.
A stockholder of the company, who had
access to the office of the company, made
n statement last evening that would indi
cate that the bookkeeping when Allen,
wnus at the helm was of a singular sort.
Ali entries, according to this informant,
w<?re made in one book, which was the
only cne that Allen kept. Cash receipts,
Etock pales, expense accounts and all
ether potable items were mixed up con
fusedly. When this was learned there
was hard talk and Allen soon after went
out. The Diamond Oil Company has a
veil down !**> feet in the McKittrick. dis
trict. Kern Ccunty, and owns a tract of
CJO acres.
Shortage Is Estimated
at From $8000 to
$10,000.

PERSONALS.Just what title Fitzhugh will be given.
If any, is not. known at this time, but he
Is recognized throughout' the country as
a thoroughly up-to-date railroad man, and
as President Hays is perfectly familiar
with his capabilities he is bound to make
his Influence felt. Fitzhugh's coming Is
awaited with interest, as there Is an air
of general expectancy and a feeling that
still other changes may be contemplated
that will not be dispelled until the prom
ised circular of President Hays Is issued.
Harriman's instructions are I to put . the
cabinet scheme into effect without delay
and the official announcement of the
change may be looked foi^any time.
Manager E. O. McCormlck. who has
made many improvements in his depart

upon, however, and said: . Â¦ â¢.-..,

* After filing the report, the Grand Jury
adjourned, dismissing a number of wit
nesses summoned without a hearing.
The police have acted, but their work is not
reported In the newspapers. United States
District Attorney "Woodworth has to my knowl
edge recently written to the Chief of Police,
thanking; him for his â¢ co-operation in certain
raids on the prostitutes in Chinatown. Lieu
tenant Price's squad in Chinatown Â¦ has done
much work that is not recorded In public
prints. For Instance, he arrested eighty per
sons recently on a charge - of - conducting or
abetting lotteries in Chinatown and the Police
Court dismissed every case for reasons best
known to the court It is hard to suppress lot
teries in Chinatown when the courts refuse to
act, and there is no appeal, as you know, from
the Police Courts when a . prisoner â¢ is dis
charged. " " Â¦
' I have read the testimony recited In the re
port of the Grand Jury and given it respect
ful consideration, but I may as well say now
as at any other. time, being fully informed,
that Iwill take no steps whatever looking to
the removal of the Chief. On the other hand
I will take every : possible step to strengthen
his hands and encourage his ; work. I, Intend
personally to make a public - statement con
cerning this department - which will give the
people information that will, satisfy" them that
they are enjoying a strong, capable and. honest
administration of the Police Department. That
is to say, it is conducted with an honest pur
pose and will be improved A from time to time
by detailing officers for special or general
duties who are best qualified for the work. I

of Vice, and voluntarily, 'as a citizen, took
an active part in the work and by his exam
ple and action has done much to Improve the
moral conditions of the city. There are Chi
nese missions in the heart ' of Chinatown,
where unwilling captives can find ref.uge. On
the other hand there are no doubt women
brought from China to San Francisco for pur
poses of prostitution. but they have been,
brought up to that life from young girlhood'
and are virtually slaves and know â¢ no other
existence, and the traffic should be suppress
ed. For the most part, however, much of this
so-called slavery is common prostitution,
which . exists among the whites to a still
greater degree. It . is one of the great evils
of civilization and the less said about- it the
better. :â¢' . â¢
. It is understood that President. Hays is
very well satisfied with the management
of Kruttschnitt, but desires to afford '.him
more time for looking after the â¢ detalls.-
It Is altogether probable that in the re^
adjustment of the working machinery In

This plan is expected to relieve Stubbs
and Kruttschnitt of some of their more

he would and that every man under him must,
do his duty. Why is it that he has failed in
his promises? That he has failed we need no
further testimony than his own. That he has
willfully, deliberately and continuously disre
garded and violated laws he is sworn to up
hold and enforce has been abundantly proved.
That the people of this city may no longer rest
under the stigma of sustaining;, negatively or
positively, the infamous slave traffic and other
public evils prohibited by law we recommend
his immediate removal from office.
Phelan T>ef ends Sullivan.
Then comes the final thrust at the
Mayor, reciting his duties under the char
ter, concluding as follows:
The Grand Jury recommends that he do his
duty, and command the Police Commission
ers and other public officials, responsible for
the conditions we have described, â¢ to . perform
theirs. â¢ â¢ Â¦ - â¢
A lengthy rehash of testimony taken at
many different hearings, ! much of which
would not appear well in print, but makes
"phat" for the printer and' stenographer,
winds up the remarkable report. â¢ '
Together with the two " indictments
against . Sullivan, one charging-, the for
gery of Judge Mogan'3 name to an order
for $50," and again to an order for $100, the
report was presented to Judge Murasky.
The report was handed to the clerk .un
opened, and had it not been for:the per
sistency-of Barry in calling attention to
its recommendations, it would probably
have remained buried in the archives un
til Barry presented his bill for its print
ing. P.ail In the Sullivan cases was fixed
at $5000 on each charge. These are two
of those to which he confessed long ago.
Mayor Phelan, after being shown a
copy of the Grand Jury's report, Â¦ and af
ter familiarizing himself with Its con
tents, made the following statement: ;
I have glanced over the report prepared by
Mr. Barry, chairman of Â¦ the Grand â¢ Jury's
Committee on Police Department. . He is the
editor of the Star, a , weekly . paper, . which
has during the . past year been making . per
sistent attacks- on the department. I The report
states that Chief I Sullivan has been negligent
In enforcing the laws, and recommends his im
mediate removal.. The Police Commissioners
have t-lected Chief Sullivan for a term of four
years and I know he .has their confidence, Â¦ as
he has mine. The Commissioners, â¢ as well I as
myself, are more familiar with the | affairs of
the Police Department Â¦ than the Grand Jury,
and we are satisfied that the law is being en
forced so far. as it is possible to enforce it.
If the Chief of Police has "willfully or. cor
ruptly" â these are the words of the statute â '
neglected to perform his duty, he can be
removed and should be removed from office.
There Is no evidence of this kind.
On the contrary, the Chief has been . ag
gressive in enforcing the law. making many
enemies by it who will give their- moral sup
port to such criticisms as we have before us,
and there Is no one familiar with .the facts
that questions the honesty of his administra
tion. He has personally â¢ visited â¢ Chinese
houses of prostitution and with an interpreter
informed the women â¢ that he ' would protect
them if they desired to abandon the life they
are leading, and they should have confidence
in his good faith. He is. a man of family, has
children of his own. Before his election he was
president of the Society for the Suppression
chief topic of discussion in
I railroad circles yesterday was the
I announcement that President
H, Charles M. Hays of the Southern
Pacific is about to inaugurate a
radical change in the management of the
big railroad system, in accordance with
direct and explicit instruction from E. H.
Harrlman, head of the syndicate 'which
recently secured control of the road. E.
H. Fltzhugh, formerly of the Central Ver
mont, concerning whom there has been
so much speculation . with reference to
hij probable connection with the operat
ing department of the Southern Pacific,
will soon be in San Francisco and will
be given a position of great importance,
although under the new scheme his com
ing will not necessarily mean the dis
placement of any of the present heads of
departments. â¢ -
In brief President Hays Is about to form
a cabinet of advisers, to be composed of
the heads of practically all the principal
departments of the road with the single
exception of the law department. .The
personnel of the cabinet as at present
planned will be as follows:
President C. M. Hays, First Vice Presi
dent H. E. Huntington, Third Vice Presi
dent J. C. Stubbs, E. H." Fltzhugh and
General Manager Julius Kruttschnitt. W.
F. Heriin, head of the Southern Pacific
law department, will not be a member of
the cabinet, but he will be called into
consultation whenever . matters - pertain
ing strictly to his department are under
consideration. H. E. Huntington will not
accept re-election to the office of first
vice president,- but he will continue to bo
a member of the cabinet and "contribute
his time and experience to the manage
ment of the property In which he is - so
heavily interested.
The object of this cabinet arrangement
Is to centralize the authority and respon
sibility. President Hays will by this
means have a firmer grasp on the. details
When Chief Sullivan was -appointed to the
responsible position he was loud in condemna
tion of practices that had obtained under his
predecessors and vehemently proclaimed that
With great dramatic effect and many
copious drafts of water, volubility of ges
ture and flexibility of voice Barry ap
proached his peroration. Although the
censor's blue pencil marks were not vis
ible Barry managed to get through with
its reading without stumbling over any
of the interdicted phrases. Here was the
preliminary paragraph :
The well threshed over question of Chi
nese slavery and the conduct of the office
of Chief of Police during the brief in
cumbency of William J. Biggy consume
another large section of the report. An
interesting sidelight upon the selection of
a Chief of Police is also given in a para
graph on Major General Shafter that an
other bete noir of yciiow journalism may
be dragged in. According to Barry's re
port General Shafter was appealed to to
find an army officer who wanted the job,
but he discreetly refused to find one that
wanted to rake somebody else's chestnuts
out of the fire.
Long Reach for Shafter.
Some warm flings ore also taken in this
connection at the Mayor. and District At
torney.
Such methods â¢would be funny In a comic
opera. In the presence of a great and con
tinuous crime they become tragic and call for
instant Interference on the part of those higrher
in authority.

cannot be said." the report read?, ''â¢that
any man can faithfully serve two mas

in the trial of certain cases by the Chief
of Police, is cited as the awful example.
He was attorney, it alleges, for the Police

We have endeavored to learn the truth by
rigid examination of the v.-Knesses and other
wise, ana although vce have been only par
tially successful we feel that our Investiga
tion has developed facts astounding enough to
warrant this report, which we trust may be
followed by drastic action on the part of those
<harged with the duty, that the evils of which
we complain may n.-> Km^er be a menace and
chame to the community.
After disposing of the routine prelim
inaries Jamee H. Barry,- chairman of the
Committee on Police Department,' Police
Patrol and City Drivers, ascended to ihe
platform and in a. voice .loud enough to
be heard through the double doors and
out into the corridor beyond read a
lengthy printed report. He began- by say-
Ing that he had been ordered to prepare
the report from testimony given at regu
lar meetings of the Grand Jury that it
might be adopted for early action. The
investigation, the report recites, was com
menced last January, and the testimony
obtained covers some 4(K> pages of type
written matter. The report, the appendix
to which is hardly less voluminous, says:
Considerable difficulty was experienced
in securing a quorum and it was not until
an hour after the appointed time of meet
ing: and much use of the telephone that
the neceEsaTy dozen jurors were secured.
Finally fifteen answered to rollcail: Secre
tary Danforth, W. E. Lutz and Harry M.
Kelly were the absentees. Danforth has
resigned as secretary and his place r.as

Captain Seymour, head of the detective
.bureau, handed to Chief Sullivan yester
'day his first annual report of the work of
himself and staff since his Incumbency, on
April 16, last year. The report shows that
the bureau has done its full share of. the
work of the, department.
: During the year. 6371 complaints were
registered; the value of; property recov
ered amounted to $29,113 10; 3600 criminal
circulars were issued; 1011 letters . were
written and 840 arrests were made. In
this regard the captain says:
â¢ "This report will be but an index to the
work done by the bureau, as It Is impos
sible to reduce to a definite form a great
and perhaps, the greater portion of the
labor performed by detective officers."
The captain also says:
; "During that time â¢ there have been
available for active outside duty a total
of twenty-four detective officers. This
force Is not adequate to the work required
of. the bureau, and I beg to urge an in
creas*e in the number of detective officers.
I am pleased to be able to say that most
of* the Important criminal cases arising
during my incumbency have been con
ducted" to a successful conclusion."
â¢ Appended to the report was a record of
all arrests made by detective officers dur-
Jn the year, which will be printed, and
will serve as a ready' reference and will be
useful to the detectives. ... .

Beer-Drivers' Trouble Settled.
The trouble heretofore existing between
the beer drivers and the Brewers' Pro
tective Association has at last been ami
cably adjusted. The. officers of the Brew
ers' Association and the Beer I>rlvers'
Union have attached their signatures to
an agreement which regulates the em
ployment of beer drivers and stablemen
in all the. breweries of this city, with the
exception of two. The wage scale rules
and regulations agreed on In the contract
.will so into effect on Monday next.
The union decided to levy an assess
ment on all of Its members of $1 to assist
in defraying the expenses of the recent
strike In Portland, and the dues of the
union were raised to $1 per month, la
conformity with a regulation of the Na
tional Union that' all locals in the same
city must pay equally high dues.

The admission of the Shipping Clerks

mittee' for further Investigation.
Having disposed of the boycott question
the Council proceeded to transact its
usual business, which consisted In part of
receiving reports from committees. This
included the lifting of the boycott from
the cooper shop of J. Kuclch, he having
agreed to unionize his shop.
The Metal Polishers, Buffers and Pla
ters, through their delegates, reported
that the strike was still on, with seventy
flve men out. The trouble of the beer

olive branch will be hoisted next Monday.

I ED ROSEN BERG. Secretary. â¢
Committee Eeports Beceived.
The Building Trades Council continued" to
boycott the baseball games. During all this
time the Labor Council stood ready to fight
the West Coast Furniture Company along lines
that .it could approve, and when the Varnish
ers' And , Polishers' Union, ' affiliated ,both with
the Labor and Building Trades councils, re
quested the former body to levy a boycott on
the West Coast Furniture- Company the execu
tive committee of the Labor Council instructed
(Secretary Rosenberg of that organization and
Organizer J. D. Pierce of the American . Fed
eration of Labor to Interview that company
and request It to make peace with the unions.
The constitution of the Labor Council, follow
ing that of . the American Federation of Labor
in the matter of levying boycotts, prescribes
that before a boycott is levied there shall be
an â¢ Investigation had and . the party against
whom ' the boycott g> Is sought must first be
given an opportunity to right the wrong with
which he Is charged. After several conferences
with the committee of the Labor Council the
West Coast Furniture Company signed the de
cision of the arbitration board, thus ending 1 the
long and bitter fight for the eight-hour day.
The Labor Council, the Building Trades Coun
cil and their affiliated unions all have helped
to gain this victory, and each and all ought
to be glad that what at one time threatened
Boycott of Baseball Games.
Harris & Co., owning a cigar store at 3 and
5 Stockton street, San Francisco, became in
volved in the fight through the letting of a
contract for fixture work for their cigar store
to the West Coast Furniture Company. I The
Building ' Trades â¢ Council declared unfair any
store or place of amusement in which Henry
Harris is interested. The fight thus spread
to .the baseball games. At this stage the
Building Trades Council requested the Labor
Council to indorse the boycott on the base
ball concerns. After thorough investigation,
by the i executive committee of the Labor
Council and after' committees of the Building
Trades Council had been given hearings be
fore the executive committee and the Council
itself, by a vote of 15 to 60 the Labor Council
refused, to Indorse the boycott on the baseball
concerns. /The Labor Council decided that it
was .not. just to boycott, the baseball concerns
because one of their members in pursuit of a
business entirely foreign to the' baseball
games was accused of an unfriendly act to
ward the trade unions'-' of this city. Â¦â¢
The West Coast Furniture Company (L. &
E. Emanuel). having signed the decision of
the arbitration board selected to arbitrate the
millmen's strike, thus becoming a union con
cern, â¢ the following statement of the attitude
of the Labor Â¦ Council In the controversy is,
we believe, of general public interest.
Without exception the trade unions of this
city supported the Millmen's Union in Its fight
for the eight-hour day and the recognition of
the union. Moral and financial assistance was
rendered. â¢ When the arbitration board chosen
to adjust this industrial dispute rendered Its
decision and : some of the members of the
Planing Millmen's Association refused to abide
by the same, the trade unions of this city
stood ' ready to continue their support to the
millmen's and other unions directly affected
by this refusal. The West Coast Furniture
Company refusing to " sign the arbitration
agreement, a fight has been carried on against
Attitude of Labor Council.
The following 1 report of Secretary
Rosenberg and Delegate Pierce was sub
mitted to the Council, adopted by unani
mous vote and ordered spread on the min
utes: ...-â¢_
Every available seat In the large hall of
Pythian Castle was. filled at the meeting
of the San Francisco Labor Council last
night, members anticipating a discussion
of the settlement ot this trouble, which
had been effected late in the week
through the instrumentality of Secretary
Ed Rosenberg and; National Delegate J.
D. Pierce. 'Â¦ Â¦ â¢
The boycott of the, firm of .L. & E.
