The debate was continued at length. Delegate
W\ H. Lightner of Minnesota speaking against
the measure and the Rev. DrsJ Baker of New
Jersey, Evans of Pennsylvania j and Martin of
New Mexico in favor of It.
The Itev. Dr. Arnold of Southern Florida
ergrued on tha same side, earing: "Many of
us wens originally in dioceses, and for the
advantage of the church missionary Jurisdic
tions were formed out of thooo dioceses. Is
It fair or Just that we should be disfranchised
because wÂ« happen to be carved out of exist
ing dioceses? I look upon it as an act of in
justice and I ask you to right this matter."
The Rev. Dr. Penrlck made a vigorous plea
on the same side, saying: "I happen to know
of my own personal knowledge that the dis
franchising of missionary districts is keeping
out of the missionary field the strong,, stalwart
men of tne church, the only men worth stand
ing-room in the field, the only men who can
ever make it other than missionary. Human
nature being what it Is men of brain and
brawn will not hasten to be shorn of their
right of suffrage, a right which is vouchsafed
to the weakest diocese in this land. They will
cot hasten to submit to an unwarrantable, un
just, unreasonable, senseless discrimination,
and hence our missionary Bishops cry in vain,
cry till they are sore of throat and sick of
heart fcr the manly thought necessary for the
winning of their hard fields, but the men come
not."
Deputy Evans of Pennsylvania felt con
strained to vote against the measure, and
thought the missionary districts had no
more right to vote than did the Territo
ries of the United States in Congress.
CANON DENOUNCED AS UNJUST
The Rev. Mr. Martin of Texas pleaded
for representation of the missionary dis
tricts. The aci of voting pop.sefsspd by tbe
dloceops was a bribe held out by the dio
ceses to Induce thu clergy to leavo the
missionary flHd nnd accept a ehargo In
a dloccae. he said. Whnt would havo been
thought If St. Paul In returning to Jeru
ealom had been told ho had no right to
talk In the general convention of, the
npontles because lie was "only a mlMlon
ary"? the speaker asked.
ThÂ» Her. Dr. WlnchenUr of Mlniourl argued
earnestly for the right! of the mlsiionarlM to
re presentation In the convention, saying that
th*y constituted a large part or tha clerical
rÂ«?presÂ«nt*tlon of .the churrb. It was nothing
but an act of Justice that the? should be given
representation In this body, he said.
The Rev. Dr. Davenport called attention
to the words of the constitution of one
hundred years ago and thought the mis
sionary districts had a perfect right to
representation In t&e General Convention.
JOeputy Lightner of Minnesota opposed
Â«â¢>Â« amendment He said it had always
llsen voted down when, brought up. He
Aid not think that the canons and con-
Dr. MeCcnnell of Long Island opposed
the amendment for the reason that the
missionary districts were not really part
of the convention. The church and the
convention vrere entirely different. The
missionary districts were part of the
church, while the convention only recog
nized dioceses of which It was composed.
On the recommendation of thÂ« commlt-
the house concurred -with the lilih
cpa In ita aessajre No. 40, relative to the
amendment of article T, section 2, of the
â¢constitution, substituting the word "or"
Xor "and" at the end of the second line
and striking out the words "arising there^
from" In the third line. The house con
curred la adopting the amendment?
' The committee recommenucd, and the
bouse voted with them, the adoption of
the amendment to article II, section 1, of
the constitution passed by the Bishops, in
volving the right of a missionary Bishop
to become a diocesan when his district <s
changed Into a diocese.
THE 2USSIOITABY DISTRICTS.,
The house then considered the report of
the committee on amendments to the con
stitution. The first report was on the
. tmeniment to eive deputies from mls
-^Uionary districts the right to vote In the
General Convention, except the right to
vote by orders. The committee recom
mended the adoption of the report.
Ex-Governor Prince of New Mexico
made an earnest plea for the adoption of
â¢the amendment. He urged that many
missionary districts were larger and
EtroEgrer than dioceses and therefore
ehould have full representation In the
convention.
The I?ev. Dr. Huntincton from the com
jnittee on amendment* of the constitu
tion reported on various matters as fol
lows: Adversely to the amendment to

SNAPSHOTS OF SCENES AT TRINITY CHURCH DURING A RECESS OF
THE EPISCOPAL CONVENTION, THE SESSIONS OF .WHICH ARE
BEING HELD IN THAT STATELY EDIFICE.
THE most important business
transacted by the House of
Deputies at its afternoon . ses
sion was the election of the Rev.
Cameron Mann of Missouri- as
-Missionary Bishop of North Da
kota. His election was held behind closed
doors and was a unanimous one. v
At its open session the house took up
mttters on its calendar and disposed of
them in quick order. A resolution offered
by the Rev. Dr. Tayler of Los Angeles,
having in view the closing up of three
Items on the calendar, created a long dls
cuEsion. The resolution called for the ap
pointment of a joint commission to inves
tigate the change of name of the church.
After a warm debate the resolution was
adopted. The commission will contain
members of both houses and its members
will report the result of their labors to
the next General Convention.
An effort was made to secure favorable
.action upon tha memorial sent In by the
diocese of Kansas, requesting that West
tern Kansas be set off as a missionary dis
trict. When the ' convention took an'ad
journment the subject was still under
consideration and it will be taken up this
'morning. â¢ ..'. - r
When the House of Deputies convened in
the aiterr.oon it went' into executive session to
'rafs upon the nomination cf Rev. Cameron
.Mann nr Mipsou*-' to be missionary Bishop of
.North Dakota. His selection was unanimously
'ici..oit u a..a Lu*. ju.a.iin was \u25a0 elacted to \u25a0 the
vacant district. - . . â¢ - \u25a0 \u25a0-
The committee on order of business, recora- J
'mended that after action on the amendments ;
.to the constitution and on amendments to
car.ons pending the house take up the calendar
and dispose of the matters thereon in the order
â¢in which thov stood. The house adopted the '
recommendation. â¢ \u25a0'.,'\u25a0
FORMATION OF OT3W DIOCESES.
The Rev. Dr. Egar of New York introduced
a canon relative to the formation of new dlo-'
ceses. Upon motion by J. Pierpont Morgan,
a vote was taken by orders and dioceses and
It was adopted without a dissenting vote. It
is as follows:
â¢Section i. A new diocese may be formed
\u25a0with the consent of the General Convention
.and under such conditions as the General Con
x-entlon shall prescribe by general canon or
canons, (1) by the erection Into a diocese of
the whole or any part of one or more mis
sionary districts; (2) by the division of an
existing diocese; <3) by the junction of two or
more dioceses, or of parts of two or more dio
ceses, or (4) by the Junction of the whole or
part of a missionary district with a diocese or
with any part of one or more dioceses. The
proceedings shall originate in a convocation of
the clergy and laity of the missionary district
called by the Bishop for that purpose; or, with
the approval of the Bishop, in the convention of
the diocese to be divided; or (when It is pro
posed to form a new tiocese by the junction
of two or more dioceses or of parts of two or
rnoro dioceses) by mutual agreement of the
conventions of the dioceses concerned, with' the
approval of the Bishop or the ecclesiastical
authority of each diocese. In case the episco
pate of a diocese be vacant no proceedings to
ward its division Ehall be taken until the va
cancy be filled. During a vacancy in a mis
sionary district the consent of the presiding
Bishop must be had before proceedings to erect
it Into a diocese are taken. When It shall ap
pear to the satisfaction of the General Con
vention, by a certified copy of the proceed
ings and other documents and papers laid be
;fcre It, that all the conditions for the forma
tion of the new diocese have been complied
with and that it has acceded to the constitution
.and canon* of thu church such new diocese
shall thereupon be admitted to union with the
: General Convention.
. "Section 2. la case one diocese Ehall be di
vided into two or more dioceses the Bishop
â¢ of the diocese divided may elect the one to
.which he will be attached, and he shall there
upon become the Bishop thereof; and the
Bishop coadjutor. If there be one, may elect
the one to which he will be attached, and (If
It be not the one elected by the -Bishop) he
ehall be the Bishop thereof.
1 "Section 3. In case a diocese shall be formed
out of parti of two or more dioceses each of
\u25a0the Bishops and Bishops coadjutor of- the sev
,eral dioceses out of which the' new diocese has
been formed shall be entitled, In order of
.seniority of consecration, to the choice be
tween his own diocese and the new diocese so
formed. In case the new diocese shall not be
so chosen it shall have the right to choose its
own Bishop.
â¢ "Section L Whenever a new diocese is
.formed and erected out of aa existing diocese
.It shall be subject to the constitution and
canons ot the diocese out of which It wu
.termed, except as local circumstances may pre-
come and properly for all time. I therefore
am in favor of the appointment of such a com
mission." .
WITHDRAWS HIS MOTION.
Delegate \u25a0 Packard said that on reflection It
occurred to him that his motion to indefinite
ly postpone was not a courteous way to treat
a matter coming from the House of Bishops,
and he would therefore withdraw It and leave
it in shape for the vote to be taken on the
question of concurrence with the Bishops.
The Rev-. Dr. H. H. Oberle of New Jersey
said he thought the best way to settle the ques
tion was to refer it to the Joint commission
proposed by the Bishops and let that commls-
Flon report at the next General Convention. He
thought so much was -due to the decent respect
that was coming to the Bishops.
The Rev. Dr. Huntlngton of New York fol
lowed, saying: "I am unalterably opposed to a
change of the name of this church at the
present time. I believe that if a large, states
manlike and sympathetic ecclesiastical policy
be pursued by this church the time will come,
perhaps three generations hence, when the
church will have earned a new name. I do
not desire to see her wear it, sir, till she earns
It. At the same time, I purpose to vote to con
cur with the House of Bishops, not on\y from
a sense of courtesy to that house, whose re
quests, it appears to me, ought always to be
complied with by this house, when it can be
done conscientiously and without great objec
tion, but also out of courtesy to a considerable
number of the clergy in this church,, to the
lesser . proportional number of laity in the
church who earnestly desire to see the sub
ject investigated and exploited: - - â¢â¢
"The last great discussion of this subject was
in 1877 in the city of Boston. When we .meet
again, sir. we will reopen the subject and dis
cuss it, and. as I believe, it will be done with
the _ same- result. A quietus was given to the
subject for twenty-five years at Boston. I be
lieve that another quietus for twenty-five years
will be given it at Boston. At the same time,
I think fairness and courtesy toward the
House of Bishops and fairness . to those mem
bers of this house and the other members of
this church whom they represent, demands that
we concur with this request of the House o'f
Bishops.
"It is unnecessary for me to say, sir, that I
separate myself with deep regret from the
members of this house with whom I have been
in the habit of acting and who have been in
the habit of acting with me, and Join myself
to the company of those from whom my
schemes have received nothing but opposition;
but a sense of Justice and of courtesy com
pels me." \u25a0\u25a0â¢'. \u25a0 ., .
The Rev. Dr. Greer followed and said this
was not the time for this subject to be dis
cussed. He said further: "Let it come before
us openly and squarely and let us discuss It.
Let every man express his opinion and put
himself on record, but' I submit that this mes
sage from the House of Bishops is simply to
create a commission to consider and report it
at some other time. It is neither positive nor
negative."
HOUSE BECOMES ENTATTGLED.
- The Rev. Dr. Davenport followed and ar>>
gued in favor of the resolution.
: Mr. Lewis made a motion to have numbers
8 and 9 indefinitely postponed, but the motion
wasunheacd in the maze of points of order and
suggestions of tho delegates.
Dr. Parks asked what question was before tha
house and the chair Informed him that an ef
fort was being made to clear the docket.
â¢ The resolution was temporarily sidetracked
and the house passed upon the various matters
on the calendar. 'â¢.'Â»-â¢ . \u25a0'\u25a0.\u25a0'\u25a0
In quick order the various Items were settled
The report from the committee on the prayer
book was adopted. The Rev. ! Dr. Tayler s rei
olutlon offered early in the session relative to
the prayer book was taken off the calendar by
consent. The following resolution, introduced
by the Rev. Dr. Ringwalt, was adopted: -.
"Resolved, That it is the sense of this con
vention that good citizenship is a fundamental
principle of religion. That the church, mind
ful of the growing tendency to unchecked.cor
ruption in the conduct of our municipal affairs
throughout- the United States, the indifference
to and covert countenance of immorality, gamb
ling and. vice, places herself. on. record as ask
ing her sons to take an active part at the
ballot box and elsewhere where occasion' per
mits, toward the' suppression qf these pernicious
Influences." â¢ -\u25a0 \u25a0
The resolution of Dr. Tayler for the appoint
ment of a Joint commission on the change of
name of- the church was then taken up. Dr.
Parks of New York said:- . -. .
DR. PARKS SPEAKS IN PAVOK.
"I would be heartily grateful to Almighty
God if I thought we could call this the Holy
Catholic Church In , the United States. I be
lieve the time will come when you can. I be
lieve - you . canâ not now., I wish to say .with
due respect as a deputy on the floor of this
house, I wholly object to having the courtesy
to the House of Bishops interfere with the ab
solute freedom of this house. I therefore do
not feel there is any courtesy that prevents
me from voting on any message from elsewhere.
"Now, 'I want to say why I would adviso
some of us who don't want to have the name of
thÂ© church changed to vote for this motion.
The committee win not be census takers. They
will simply do this: They will be the means
whereby there will be persistent discussion of
this thing for three years. Now you say tha'.
that 13. lamentable. I concur with you, but
how far more lamentable would it be if there
was no discussion. It will bo a festering sore.
Therefore we had better open it and' let it
run â let It run. I would therefore advise those
who think It is a bad method to vote for It."
Rev.. Dr. Spauldlngr of Alabama urged the
reference of the matter to the proposed corn.
misslon, saying that this question was coming
up and had to be faced.
The Rev. Dr. Alsop of Long Island agreed
with Dr. Parks in protesting against the Idea
that their action wa3 to be coerced . in the
name of courtesy due to the House of Bishops;
this house was to act for Itself, regardless of
the judgment of the Bishops.
Deputy Buxton of North Carolina offered a
substitute to Inform the Bishops that the depu
ties decline to appoint their part of the pro
posed commission because it did not deem it
expedient to keep the subject alive. This was
ruled out of order, because the same result
would be had from a vote of non-concurrence.
The vote was taken by orders and dioceses
on the queption of non-concurrence with the
Bishops, and the house voted to concur by the
following vote:

The memorial of the diocese of Kansas,
asking to have a portion of that State set off
as a missionary district was brought to the at
tention of the house by a deputy, who asked
to have it dropped from the calendar.
The Itev. Dr. Watkins of Kansas raised
strenuous objection to such action. He de
livered a strong speech in favor of the adop
tion of the majority report of the committee
on new dioceses. In part he said:
"We are not cutting off a desert to burden
the church, but ask for the Episcopal super
vision because the church haa grown. We
have 500,000 of people and a great many are
ready to ! receive the administration of the
church. The Bishop of Kansas has offered to
give Western Kansas J3200 out of the amount
apportioned to him. All we ask for Is |14C0
more and Episcopal supervision. This is not
a cry of distress, but a request for something
that should be given us."
The Hev. Dr. Crawford followed and In part
said: - \u25a0
"As a general missionary of Western Kan
sas I feel it my duty to speak Just a mo
ment on this subject. I would like to say that
we of Western Kansas realize the necessity of
more active work being done there. Wo have
petitioned- this convention to give us the de
sired help and wa.have thought that nothing
would help us so much as the supervision of a
missionary Bishop. You heard/ the night be
fore last, I think It was, of the opportunities
that were lost to us or lost to our church in
Cuba. And I can indorse what was said by tho
good Bishop of Pennsylvania in regard to the
opportunities lost to the church in Cuba, as I
was there and heard Dr. Nelson speak almost
with tears of tho opportunities we let slip In
the Island of Cuba. And I feel if we do not do
something for the church in Western Kansas
we will regret it, as we are letting opportuni
ties slip there. If you give us a Bishop for
Western Kansas It won't be very many years
before we will give youback a diocese."
The majority and minority reports were) then
read by the secretary. The Rev. Dr. Greer
arose to a point of order. . He submitted that
under the constitution the matter was in the
hands of the House of Bishops. The chair did
not hold this opinion and the debate continued..
Mr. Randall of. Maryland, a member of the
committee on nnw dlocrses.- followed, and spoke
in favor of aiding Kansas.
\u25a0 Dr. Alsop. chairman of the committee, arose
to a qupstlon of privilege and charged that
Mr. Randall -had not given a fair statement of
the case. , - - "â¢\u25a0
.The Rev. Dr. Nolan closed further discussion
by moving that the house take un further con
sideration of the fubject this mornlnsf. Before
an adjournment, was takPn a number of mes
sages from the House of Bishops, were read.
The first, one informed the deputies that \u25a0 the
Honso of Bishops had adopted a canon to dls-
Hnllne ministers who abandon their churches.
The next mespacre . asked for a committee on
conference to discuss section 3, article 1 of the
constitution. Tlie committpe will consist of
the Bishops of Albany and Vermont, the Rev.
Dr. Edgar, the Rev. Dr. Roberts and .Judge
Stlness. â¢ '. : \u25a0 : \u25a0-. . \u25a0â¢
Another mersa^e Informed the dsDUties that
the Bishops -had not concurred .: In - certain
â¢â¢Why not consider the subject. If the
church is adverse to it it will do no harm.
We at any rate will have dealt fairly with it
and shown that we have examined the ques
tion and not treated It as a town meeting sub
ject. Is any one afraid of It? This, matter
began long ago. The diocese of Rhode Island
changed its name as Icng ago as 1846. 9 It is
not a new subject. There have been dif
ferences about the name. Some wise com
mission may 'find a- way by which thjH question
may be settled properly for many years to
"Kesol%-ed, That this house concurs with
the House of Bishops on Its message No. 24,
asking lor the appointment of a Joint commit
tee en the change of name of the church, and
all memorials and resolutions on the proposed
change of name be referred to the committee
when appointed." \u25a0 â¢
Delegate Lewis of Pennsylvania â¢ said this
question had come before and been discussed
by every convention since that of 1886 in Chi-,
cago and nothing new remained to be said
on it. The house was prepared to vote on it
and it was useless to keep up the agitation,
which was unsettling the church. The change
of name would not be made and the matter
should be put at rest now and for all time
Instead of belnk kept alive as a disturbing
question.
The Rev. Dr. Hodges of Maryland spoke in
favor of the resolution. Mr. Packard followed
and said he heartily concurred with Mr.
Lewis. "The motion which we are invited to
affirm," he eaid, "Is a motion, as I understand
from the message that was sent us, to ascer
tain the sentiments of this church on this sub
ject. Now. sir. In addition to the objections
urged, I wish to bring this suggestion before
the convention and that is, that this body of
men here assembled Is sent here for the very
purpose of representine the opinion of the
church. Three years hence it will contain a
similar body of men sen* to represent the
church. Now how can five Bishops, five pres
byters and five laymen get at the opinion
the church?" - . .. w .
An objection was raised at this juncture
that, the speaker was opening up. a discussion
or the subject. Whereupon Mr. Packard made'
a motion to indefinitely postpone Nos. 8 and
9 on the calendar and also the resolution of
fered by Dr. Tayler. \
Chairman Lindsay ruled that the house could
discuss the subject. . Mr. Packard continued
and said the third objection he had to the
passage of the resolution was that It would
bring party feeling Into the church. Â«Â»
Delegate Morehouse pleaded for the con
sideration in a dignified way for three years
more . of the question, which he said ante
dated the Chicago convention, and would In
any event come before the next convention and
continue to come before . conventions of the
church and be agitated until the proposed
change . of named was s adopted.
> Judge. Stincss followed and spoke In favor of
the resolution. In part he said: . .

with such constitution and canons by the con
vention of the new diocese. "Whenever a dio
cese is formed out of two or more existing:
dioceses It shall be subject to the constitution
and canons of that one of the said existing dio
ceses to -which the greater number of clergy
men ehall have belonged prior to the erection of
such new diocese, except as local circumstances
may prevent, until the same be altered in ac
cordance with such constitution and canons by
the convention of the new diocese.
"Section 5. A diocese formed out of a mis
sionary district shall be subject to the consti
tution and canons to which such missionary
district was subject, until the same be al
tered in accordance with such constitution and
canons by the convention of the new diocese.
"Section 6. No new diocese shall be formed
which shall contain fewer than six self-sup
porting parishes or fewer than six presbyters
who have been for at least one year canonically
resident within the bounds of such new dio
cese, regularly settled In a- parish or congre
gation and qualified to vote for a Bishop. Nor
shall such new diocese be formed if thereby
any existins diocese shall be so reduced as to
contain fewer than twelve self-supportingr par

siding therein and settled and qualified as
above provided."
The Hev. Dr. Haupt of Minnesota asked nnd
obtained, unanimous consent to the Introduc
tion of a resolution, which was adopted, ex

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â All litigation
with regard to the vrill of Jacob S. Rogers
has been settled. In commenting on this
Bcbert de Forest, counsel for the Metro
politan Museum of Art. said:
The effect of thl3 settlement will be to put
the museum in a short time in possession of
Rogers' residuary estate, tho value of which
Is more than $5,000,000, and to enable it. to
promptly carry out his benevolent intentions,
the execution of which might otherwise have
been delayed for several years by protracted
litigation.
The amount paid in settlement was $250,000,
about 5 per cent of the amount Involved and
not much more .than a year's normal Income
on this amount ot property. While further
litigation over his will was quite possible the
chief subject of settlement was the claim made
against hi3 estate that by making the, museum
his residuary legatee he has violated an agree
ment alleged to have been made between him
self and his deceased brothers, whose surviving
children are his next of kin, whereby these
brothers, in default of issue, were to make
mutual wills and were to leave their property
to the others or to their issues.' There is eonrj
reason to believe that an agreement of this
general character once existed, though it is
certain that if it existed Rogers did not sup
pose It to be operative at the time he made his
will in favor of the museum. That such an
agreement might have been made at some time
respecting the family interests in the Rogers
Locomotive Works at Paterson would not have
been unlikely.
In any case the amount paid is unquestion
ably less than the expense and loss Incident to
protracted litigation, however successful, and
even 11 family claims have by this settlement
been recognized to a greater extent than under
the will (his legacies to the members ol his
family agrgregated |25O,OOO and by this settle
ment these legacies are practically doubled) the
amount of Rogers' public bequests is unques
tionably Increased and the tims within which
the public can benefit by his bequests is ma
terially shortened. , . â¢

SAN RAFAEL., Oct. 16.â Owing to the
prompt work of his little brother, Fred,
12-year-old John Gordon was saved from
death in the bay off Sausalito this morn
ing, where the children had been swim
ming. Accompanied by several other
youngsters the two boys ventured out a
considerable distance from shore. John
was seized by a cramp, and quickly sank.
No help was at hand and the little fellow
went down twice. He was about to sink
for the third time when his brother Fred
iSeized him by the hair. The drowning
boy struggled and fought,- but the brother
never loosened his grip until he had
dragged him to safety,' a/ distance of
more than seventy yards. By this time a
number of persons had collected and will
ing hands soon restored the little fellow
to consciousness.
\u25a0 Fred was the hero of the hour and was
modest for a boy who had just saved an
elder brother's life. Both children live in

Cssclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 16.â The Board of Su
pervisors and the people of Santa Clara
County have been "gold-bricked" out of
$1000 in the publication of "Reminiscences
of Santa Clara Valley and Ban Joae,"
Just it sued. That sum. was paid to
Amaury il&rs for getting out what was
euppcsed to be a history of the county
and Its resources. Instead, the publisher
has devoted most of the book to por
traits of the French residents of San Jose,
countrymen cf Mars, and the few remain
ing pases are given up to ridiculing the
people of California. The volume is a
freak in the uee of language, and the
English, as well as the opinions expressed,
easily convinces one that the writer has
net been long in America-
Even thÂ© Board of Supervisors feel they
have been bilked, and the 1000 copies sup
plied by. Mars are now nailed up tightly
in the board rooms, while the Supervisors
are considering whether to have them cir
culated or net.
liars intimates in his work that it is
the occasional custom of the men of San
Jose to act as dry nurses.
"The master of the home of California,"
etates the bock, "has managed to trans
fer himself into a rather peculiar house
keeper. He even constitutes himself a
dry nurse, who cannot readily be ex
celled."
After tbua describing the men the San
Jose women are thus held up to ridicule:
"We have actually Been women in San
Jose put on gloves for the purpose of
frying eggs, a beefsteak or a chop, and
Vuch proceeding is to say the least amus
ing."
These zre but samples of the way Cali
fornians are handled in "Reminiscences
of Santa Clara Valley and Srh Jose."
The author says it is necessary in writing
the history of the people of California to
"leave out much that would not look good
In print."
In- dealing with the doctors this doughty
Frenchman says: "They will make It a
duty to render you sufficiently ill to en
able them to see the color of your
money."
The press of San Jose is "relegated to
the god Dollar and Judge Pull," that
chapter reads, "but a well regulated sys
tem cf financiering sometimes renders it
amenable to reason."
A few pictures of the late carnival hold
in honor of President McKinley's visit
to 6an Jose are the only good featuro
cf the book.
As the work is supposed to be circulated
in both France and the United States, tho
people are wondering what the foreigners
\u25a0will think of California men as dry nurses
and the women who wear gloves at their
cooking.
Mr. ilars, however, has the $1000 that
he received for publishing this ridicule
and a.buse of the people.

LONG BEACH, Oct. 16.â Joseph Owens
attempted to commit suicide last, night by
swailowing two ounces of carbolic acid.
Owens arrived here a week ago. Miss

of Miss Baker, who did not care to know
or associate with him. ' Last night Owens
went to thÂ© Brewer home and annoyed
the inmates .by loud and offensive lan
guage, after which ho went to his room
and wrote Miss Baker a note, Baying he
had something important to see her about
and if she did not come he was going to
take $10 worth of carbolic acid and 10
cents' worth of magnesia. If she wanted"
to see him alive she must comeujQulckly.
The last sentence was repeated several
times. '. . .â¢-..* \u25a0
' In the meantime Owens had sent a boy
to the drug store to purchase two ounces
of carbolic acid. Miss 1 Baker was so
frightened by the epistle that she gave it
to Mr. Brewer, who immediately came
downtown. Accompanied by friends, ho
\u25a0went to the rooming-house, and found
Owens lying on the bed unconscious. The
vial of carbolic acid was empty. A doctor
was summoned and after several \u25a0 hours'
hard work succeeded in savingr Owens'
life. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 < " . - ,

by the officers to break the door brought
the youth to his, senses.

The General Frisble and the Montlcello,

repairs yesterday. While on her way to

a floating pile, as that Is the only thing
that can account for the loss of two
blades of her propeller. Captain Hatch
got her. back to the wharf and at once
telegraphed his agent at Vallejo to send
the Monticello down. On the way up

WASHINGTON, Oct 16.â There are now
>09 lepers and 164 clean persons at the
Molokai leper settlement in Hawaii, ac
rordlng to a report just received from
Chief Quarantine Officer Cofer, In charge
of the Marine Hospital work In Hawaii.
All these are housed, fed, clothed and
governed for $50,000 a year.
The report praises the hopeful and
cheerful way In which these poor people
resign themselves to their fate and points
out that such contentment can thrive
only on a comfortable mode of life and
good treatment.. Surgeon Cofer reports
that he made careful Inquiries as to the
chances of the Infection of the clean peo
ple working among the lepers, and that
â¢he general opinion was that in time they
would become lepers. In the last ten
years, however, only ten clean residents
have become lepers.
The Board of Health has Initiated a
new system for preventing the lepers and
their relatives and friends from embrac
ing and kissing each other by marching
ihe visitors immediately from the
steamer landing to a corral with a double
fence. The friends are compelled to re
main Inside this inciosure and the lepers
gather around and talk through the bars.
Visitors are permitted at any time under
this system. Instead of only once a year,
as formerly. The results of known ex
posure to leproBy show an uncertainty as
to the chances of Individual Infection,
which makes the disease one of the most
difficult to operate against. Women are
Â»ald to be less liable to It than men. The
jldest three patients at the settlement
fcrrlved In 1S74. 1ST5 and 1879, respectively.
The recruits to the settlement each
rear during the last decade range from
182 In 1890 to 85 In 1900. showing a gradual
Jecrease. despite the. fact that the hunt
for lepers through the islands never be
tore has been so vigorous.

REV, DO. Mil IS ELECTED,
Witnesses Tell of the Messages Sent
From tlie Brooklyn.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 16.â The Schley court of
Inquiry began proceedings to-day, as usual,
wltii tlie correction of testimony griven on the
previous flay, the witnesses summoned for this
pmrpose being Captain Cook and' Lieutenant
Commander Sears, who testified yesterday.
When they had left the stand Commander New
ton E. Mason, who was executive officer of the
Brooklyn during the war with Spain, was
osukd to relate his observations of the conduct
of the Santiago campaign. It is the purpose of
Attorney Raynor to first examine officers of
tte Brooklyn and to follow these with a num
ber of those -who were on the Oregon during
the battle of Santiago. It is understood that
his entire list of witnesses is practically con
fined to persons who were on board these two
vessels.
While Certain Cook occupied the witness
Â«tand for the purpose of correcting his testi
mony Kanna asked him:
"Referring to your statement In regard to the
steam required to t>p kept up in connection with
tho uncoupling: of the Brooklyn's engines, that
It was the order of the cemmander-in-chief
while lying off Santiago on the blockade, was
that a written orier?"
"Sly recollection is that it was a. bulletin.
The exact words I do not remember."
'"The particular point was with respect to
the uncoupling of the engines. Was there any
thing in that order on this subject and in
pursuance oi" which that was done?"
"It is my impression triat there was. They
all. as I understood it, had their engines un
coupled."
"It is a general recollection of it only?"
"Tes, that we should have our forward
engines uncoupled all the time."
â¢â¢Can vou aid us in any -pray In Identifying
the bulletin from your impression?"
"No. We could not have moved the four
engines with the steam we carried. I know
that we had an order about the epeed, and it
\u25a0was in s. circular bulletin. I think."
Captain Cook also was questioned again con
crrrdr.g the voyage of the flying 6quadron from
Cienfutgos to Santiago, as follows:
"Did the flying squadron, when proceeding
from Cier.'uegos to Santiago, proceed with all
cit-patcn?"
' "Throwing out of consideration the surround
ing circumstances and conditions that have
e'r^acy beÂ»n testified to, I 6hould say no."
Raynor â But. putting in the surrounding cir
cumstances and conditions, you would say yes,
would you not?
"Tes."
"What do yen mean by 'the eurrocsding
eire-jEaetaiices and conditions?" "
â¢"I mean that, as I undersT -nd tlie question,
ire wculd have- gone from Ci---i:uegos to Baatl
ligo and arrived there the next day after we
left Cien'uego?. with some, if not all of the ;
larcer vessels."
"What were the circumstances and condi
tions you oeak of?"
"The coaling conditions that existed at the '
tin-.e. We certainly could not have made dis
patch by turning back."
"What do you mean when you Epeai of turn
ins back?"
"I mean that we went to the eastward of
the two columns and that then, being unable
to coal the Texas, as I have stated before, we
turned back for that purpose. If you had
thrown that consideration out we would have
made dispatch. I mean in this sense: "We did
rot go in the quickest possible time from. Cien
fuegos to Santiago."
Rayncrâ I think that either I misunderstand
the question or you misunderstand both ques
tions, especially by the other side. I. thought

He says he could have remained up for
forty-eight hours, but would have bepn
driven ashore. He threw out ballast only
once a day, and this was at sunset, to
compensate for the loss of gas. With the
deviator he was able to deviate thirty
degrees from the course of the wind, and
occasionally the deviation was as much
as forty-five degrees. He attributes his
failure to the weather, the violence of the
wind and the bad quality of the gas he
used. No striking incident seems to have

witness consulted it, showed that both the
Minneapolis and the Tale had reported short
supplies of coal, the Minneapolis saying that
she had just enough to take her to Key West
The witness then read a list of the signals to
and from the Brooklyn on July 3, the list being
as follows:
July 3, 1S98, 9 a. m.â Flagship to fleet: Dis
regard motions of the commander In chief.
9:15â Brooklyn to Texas: What Is your theory
about burning of blockhouses on the hill last
night?
9 :34â Iowa to Brooklyn : ! Enemy is escaping.
9:35â Brooklyn to fleet: Enemy i3 escaping.
9:36 â Brooklyn to fleet: Clear for action.
9:45 â Brooklyn to fleet: Close up.
11:35â Brooklyn to the Oregon: Well done.
12:30 p. m.â Oregon to Brooklyn: Flag of
a strange vessel seen is Italian.
12:35 â Brooklyn to Oregon â She was built In
Italy.
While chasing the Colon the Oregon fired a
number of shots. We wigwagged her when each
one struck and a number of unimportant mes
sages were exchanged.
Messages of "Warships.
"Give us these unimportant messages as well
as you can recollect."
"When the Oregon came up on our quarter
we wigwagged to her: 'God bless the Oregon.'
Later on during the chase of the Colon we wig
wagged the Oregon to try her 13-inch guns or
something to that effect."
"Was that the signal that has been spoken
of as "try one of your railroad trains?' "
"I have heard lt spoken of outside the court,
but do not remember."
"Have you given all the signals on the day
of the battle?" ~
"No, sir (reading): '11:15 p. m.â (This is not
a signal. Just a note of when the Colon sur
rendered)â'Colon fired her lee gun and hauled
down her flag.'
" '1:25 p. m.â Brooklyn to Oregon: . "Enemy
has surrendered."
" '1:26 p. m.â Brooklyn to Oregon: "Cease
firing."
" '1:26 p. m.â Brooklyn to Oregon: "Keep
your guns loaded and trained on the v enemy."
" '1:30 p. m.â Brooklyn to Oregon: "Con
gratulations on the grand victory. Thanks for
splendid assistance."
" '1:35 p. m.â Oregon to Brooklyn: "Thank
you more than words can express."
" '1:45 p. m.â Brooklyn to flagship New York:
"We have gained a great victory. Details will
be communicated."
" '1:50 p. m.â New York to Brooklyn: "Re
port your casualties."
" '1:55 p. m.â Brooklyn to New York:
"Killed, one."
" '1:55 p. m.â Brooklyn to New York: "This
is a gTeat day for our country."
" '2:30 p. m.â New York to Brooklyn! "As
certain as far as possible position and strength
of the enemy's forces and report without de
lay."
" '2:30 p. m.â New York to Brooklyn: "Hoist
out all boats."
" '2:40 p. m.â New York to Brooklyn: "Do
you want services of chaplain to bury dead?"
" '2:45 p. m.â Brooklyn to New York: "Would
like to have services of chaplain. Will signal
time later."
" '2:50 p. m.â New York to Brooklyn: "Send
for chaplain when you want him." \u25a0
" '3:30 p. m.â New York to Brooklyn: "Send
both steam cutters and strongest towllne."
" '3:45 p. m. â Brooklyn to New York: "Both
steam cutters entirely disabled by shot. Will
use such pulling boats as we can. Will send
towline."
" '4:20 p. m.â Brooklyn to Oregon: "Follow
flag."
" '4:25 p. m.â Brooklyn to Oregon: "Close
up."
" '4:25 p. m.â New York to Brooklyn: "Will
remain in charge of prize." "
"Do you remember any incidents connected
with the slsrnal from the Brooklyn to the Ore
gon at 4:20 p. m. 'Follow flag' and at 4:25
p. m. from the Brooklyn to the Oregon 'Close
up?' "
"There was a report that there were one or
two Spanish ships to the eastward and I un
derstood the" Brooklyn and Oregon were to go
after those ships. We started off and s'j
naled the Oregon to follow us. She did not get
get under way Immediately, as I remember it,
so we signaled to her to 'close up.' "
Lieutenant McCauley also gave a list of the
signals made from the Massachusetts while
that vessel was being used as Commodore
ScWey's flagship May 31, and when asked
whether any signals had been sent to the fleet
to "not go in any closer," replied. _"No, sir."
He said he had charge of the signals and did
not remember such a signal. Leading up to
the battle of July 3, Raynor asked: "What
was the conduct and bearing of Commodore
Schley on the day of the battle?"
"Perfectly cool and steady."
"Where was the commodore? What was his
position when you saw him?"
"On the platform outside the conning tower."
"Did he make any encouraging remarks on
that day to the officers of the ship that you
heard?"
"He said, 'Give them hell; bullies!' "
"Did he say that more than once?"
"Yes, sir; several times."
"Can you give us anyincident to show that
he was not laboring under Kreat mental ex
citement on that day?"
"When Ellis was killed another officer and
myself picked up his body and started to
threw lt overboard. The commodore said,
'Don't throw him overboard. Cover him up
with somethinfi:.' "
"nearer during the chase and at the surren
der."
Lieutenant Commander Sears was then ex
cused and Commander Mason was called as
the first new witness of the day. He detailed
the siege of Cienfuegos and also referred to
the blockade of Santiago. Raynor then asked
the witness how many times he had seen Com
modore Schley under fire, to which he replied:
"During all the engagements."
"What was his general conduct, manner and
bearing on these occasions?"
"Excellent In every particular. He was
calm, collected and brave."
Asked to give a brief account of the battle
of July 3, Commander Mason, after giving the
preliminaries, said:
"As soon as I reported the battery to Captain
Cook in the conning tower, I asked him If we
should commence firing. He replied: 'Fire as
soon as you are ready.' I immediately gave
the order to Lieutenant Simpson to fire as soon
as he could, giving him a range of 3500 yards.
I think the first gun was fired within five min
utes or very close to five minutes after the
first alarm. The rest of the battery took up
the fire at once and continued to fire on the
port bow until the ranges commenced to get
down to 1800 and 1600 yards. I asked Captain
Cook as to which way he was going round, lt
being necessary for me to know on account of
changing the battery below, shifting from one
side .to the other. He answered that he was go
ing .with port helm. I gave the necessary or
ders on deck and went below.
Position of the Enemy.
"As I arrived in the after cabin the after
five-Inch gun was fired for the last time on
the port side and the starboard gun took up
the fire immediately. The starboard battery
was then engaged for the rest of the action.
The range at the time we turned, as far as I
remember, waa about 1400 yards, although I
have a recollection of 1100 yards being sent to
me once. As to the position of . the enemy,
they were on the port bow outside of the har
bor when we made the turn with the port helm.
At the end of the turn they were on our star
board beam and quarter with one of them a
little ahead."
Raynor â What time was that when the Colon
ran ashore ?
"I took no time. I only saw by the report
that it was about 1:15 p. m."
"After the surrender was accomplished where
did the Brooklyn go?"
"When Captain Cook returned on board we
were sent to the eastward at once by the com
modore to intercept a Spanish man-of-war that
was reported first by the Resolute and then
by the Vixen."
"Did you intercept any Spanish man-of
war?"
"About dusk we met the Austrian cruiser
Maria Teresa."
"Was that the vessel you were ordered to In
tercept?"
"I Imagine that It was the vessel, because
we had some difficulty in distinguishing the
difference between the Austrian and Spanish
flags when they were not holding out straight,
so much so that the commanding officer of the
Austrian hoisted an international signal, 'We
are Austrians.' "
On cross-examination Commander Mason said
he had. not made the coal supply his especial
concern. He had not discussed the question
-with the commodore, nor had he had conversa
tions on any other official matters. He was
quite sure that the Brooklyn was not partic
ularly short of coal. After the turn of the
Brooklyn the lowest range was 2200 or 2400
yards.
Hanna asked about the Oregon in the chase.
The witness said that her course was about 500
yards from that of the Brooklyn and on the
Brooklyn's starboard quarter. The court asked
a number of questions before discharging the
witness. In reply to these Commander Mason
said that beyond sending men aloft and having
Captain McCalla go ashore no effort had been
made by tho flying squadron to determine
whether the Spaniards were in the harbor at
Cienfueg-os; that he knew of no American ships
being between the Brooklyn and the Spanish
ships when the Brooklyn was turning to star
board July 3; that when the Spanish fleet came
out of the harbor the Brooklyn was not In her
regular blockading position, which was- 6000
yards from the morro; that on the voyagre from
Cienfuegos to Santiago the fleet had been de
layed by the smaller vessels, especlaly the
Eagle, and but for these vessels better speed
could have been made; that he had observed
the bombardment of the. Colon, and from this
engagement had reached the conclusion that
the guns in the Spanish shore batteries were
of caliber not to exceed six or eight Inches.
The first witness at the afternoon session
was Lieutenant Edward McCauley Jr., who. as
an ensign on the Brooklyn during- the Cuban
campaign, served as Commodore Schley's sig
nal officer. He had a diary in which he had
made notes of the progress of events during
the war and frequently consulted it to refresh
his memory. He said that on May 23 the Brit
ish steamer Adula had reported that the Span
lards had left Santiago. He also spoke of thÂ»
weather on the cruise from Cienfuegos to San
tiago, saying that it was bad. He gave a num
ber of 3ignala made from and to the Brooklyn
on the voyage, most of them relating to the
condition of the collier Merrimac, which was
somewhat disabled on May 26; also to the slow
speed of the smaller vessels. It was at 6 p. m.
on that date that the engines and valves of the
Merrimac became incapacitated.

after tome discussion refused.
The report of the committee that deaconesses
be ordained at 20 years of age was then sub
mitted to the vote of the house and adopted.
The house then adjourned until 2:30 p .m.
A message was received from the House of
Bishops informing the deputies of their con
currence in message No. 60 of the deputies
for appointing a Joint commission to confer
with other religious bodies on the subject of
holy matrimony and divorce, and that the
Bishops had appointed as their part of the
commission the Blshopa of Albany and Mary
land and the Bishop Coadjutor of Rhode
Island.
The Rev. Dr. Davenport, from the committee
on canons, reported 'against concurrence with
the Bishops' message No. 22 and in lieu thereof
propoced the following:
"That title 2, canon 13, section 6, clause 5,
be amended bo as to read as foHows:
" 'On the formation of a missionary district
the Bishop consecrated or assigned thereto
shall for the administration of his jurisdic
tion select the constitution and canons of one
of the dioceses of this church, which shall re
main in force bo far as applicable to the cir
cumstances of such missionary district, except
eo far as altered by the Bishop and consrre
gation from time to time, with the approval
of the House of Bishops.' "
The house became tangled as to the proper
form of motion to non-concur with the House
of Blshopa and finally lt waa decided to vote
on a motion to concur. The motion was de
feated.
The motion prevailed by unanimous vote.
The Rev. Dr. Bccleston moved that the com
mittee be continued until the next conven
tion and tho report referred back to them.
The committee on preparing a standard Bible
asked leave to continue its work and report
at the next convention. Leave was so grunted.
The matter of courts of appeal was taken
up, the floor being accorded to the Rev. Dr.
Davenport of Tennessee, chairman of the com
mittee reporting on the matter. He felt that
the printed report of the committee would al
low the convention to either pass upon the
matter at once or continue the committee un
til tne next convention.
BEPOBT ON APPEAL COURTS.
The Rev. Dr. Egar accepted the suggestion
of Deputy Minders.
The report of the committee, with the ac
cepted changes, was ordered voted upon in the
afternoon-
The Rev. Dr. Egar, chairman of the com
mittee, moved to accept the amendment of the
previous speaker.
Deputy Minders of Long Island wanted a
transposition of words eo that the new dio
ceses might be formed with the consent of the
General Convention.
Deputy Brown of Iowa said the amendments
did not provide for the formation of a new
diocese partly out of a missionary district and
a diocese.
He moved to amend the report bo aa to cover
the case.
The committee on amendments asked that it
bo discharged from considering the change of
name of the church proposed by Deputy Hick
man. The request of the committee was
adopted after Dr. Huntington had stated that
the committee did not think it expedient to
make the change on the suggestion of a single
deputy.
The committee on amendments reported on
resolutions referred to it as to formation of
new dioceses and admission to union with the
convention, and the committee urged the adop
tion of the report.
my reference was from Cienfuegos to Santiago,
leaving out reference to the retrograde move- '
nient."
Hannaâ I did not intend to leave that out at
all.
Kaynorâ I know, but I want to bring It In
between Cienfuegos and the point you reached
south of Santiago before you started on the
retrograde movement. What were the cir
cumstances, if any, that impeded?
"Bad weather."
What was the condition of the Vixen and
Eagle and what effect did they have upon the
progress of the squadron?"
"The Eagle was unable to proceed on account
of the sea; unable to make her speed."
Judgre advocateâ Did the Vixen delay the
squadron at all on that first passage?
"I think not, considering that we were run
ning slow for the Kaele. The Vixen was a"
very much better sea boat."
Hanna â One of the circumstances was the
condition of the coal supply of the Texas?
"1 said so."
"Did the Texas have coal enough to get to
Santiago?"
"Yes."
Raynorâ Do you recollect an accident to the
Vixen on the voyage between Cienfuegos and
Santiago?" ,
"Yes. I think lt was at the time she sig
naled the blowing out of her gasket manhole
or something of that kind."
Sears Hakes Correction.
Lieutenant Commander Sears al3o made a
correction in his testimony for the purpose of
explaining the disposition of the colliers at
night while Commodore Schley was in charge
of the blockade of Santiago. He said these ves
sels .had been sent a distance out each night
and every night In different directions on ac
count of the fear of torpedo attacks. \
The Judge advocate then asked the following
question: "In regard to the conversation in
the wardroom ef the- Massachusetts, as alleged
on May 31, in order to refresh your memory in
regard to that matter, you are Informed that
Lieutenant Potts, Lieutenant Grant, Lieutenant
Glennon and Major Wood are supposed to have
been present and participated in that conver
sation?"
"1 do not recollect lt at all. It could not be
possible I said such a thing. They have mis
understood what I said. I was irritated at the
delay. In the wardroom something might have
been construed in that way. as statements often
are, but it is entirely impossible that I could
have said that. I was impatient, excited, per
haps, it being my first engagement, and I might
have made some remark. It is something some
one might have misunderstood," but that re
mark I never made."
"What do you mean by 'irritated at the de
lay?" "
"Delay of not going immediately into this
work."
"Explain what you mean by 'immediately?' "
Raynor â Just one moment. Does the state
of his irritation enter into this case? He said
he never had such a conversation. Suppose he
was irritated about it. Does that affect this
case?
Judge advocateâ If the court please, it is not
the Irritation I am directing questions about,
but lt is the delay. He says he was Irritated
at the delay, I think it is fair to tell it, fair
to the applicant that he should state what de
lay he has referred to; whether it is the delay
on that particular day in going in, as we un
derstand there was a delay on that day, or
whether It is the general delay as compare!
with previous delays while the vessels were in
that vicinity.
Raynorâ I do not object to that.
"As I recall, I was irritated at Captain Hig
ginson's request to delay the reconnolssance
until after the men's dinner. I remember that
very well."
The court questioned Commander Sears on
the points covered by his testimony of yester
day. He said In reply to these questions that
on the morning of July 3 the Brooklyn had be
gun turning to starboard immediately after
the engines were started; that the helm of the
Brooklyn had been put aport when the helm
of the Viscaya had been put aport,
"It was," he said, "a practically simulta
neous movement." He also said that when
he had said to Commodore Schley during the
battle that he thought the Brooklyn was about
its tactical diameter from the Viscaya he did
not mean that the distance was less than had
been reported by Yeoman Ellis. The tactical !
diameter of the Brooklyn had not then been j
determined and he had supposed it to be about
750 yards. The" Viscaya had been passed long
after the Brooklyn's turn and they ran along
together for some time. After the Colon had
passed the Viscaya she had outfooted the
Brooklyn and it was then that she was 12,000
yards from the Brooklyn, as indicated by the :
Btadlmeter, which the witness said he did not
consider an accurate instrument. After that
time the Colon, having exhausted her best coal,
lost her speed and the Brooklyn gained upon
her. Asked how much time had been consumed
In the Brooklyn's turn, Commander Sears said
that it seemed %-ery short to him. It might have
been fifteen or twenty minutes.
The last of the court's question was concern
ing the -relative positions of the Brooklyn and
Oregon during the chase of the Spanish ships.
The Oregon was never, he said, so near the
Viscaya as was the Brooklyn, but might have
been near the Oquendo. "We were always
nearer the Colon during- the chase," he said.
report of the committee on amendments to the
constitution providing for the election of a pre
siding Bishop of the church, to hold office for
three years. The resolution of Dr. Huntington
that the report be adopted was put to a vote
and carried.
"Were you present when Ellis was killed?"
"Yes, sir." . â¢ . .
* "How near, was Ellis to the commodore when
he was killed and to you?"
"He was standing right next to me. He
was about fifteen feet from the commodore.
I should think."
Lieutenant McCauley described the incidents
of the battle of July 3, saying that he had
"on his own hook" hoisted the signal, \u25a0 "Clear
the ship for action," and that when he had
reported this action to the commodore the lat
ter had told him to hoist "Close up."
Recurring . to the bombardment of the Colon
May 31 . the witness said that Commodore
Schley' s bearing on that occasion had not
been' different from what it had been on other
occasions.
Signal to the Oregon.
The cross-examination was ' conducted by
Hanna, who questioned the witness in detail
concerning the sisnal to the . Oregon to use
her 13-inch ' *runs, asking the witness why he
remembered it especially.
"Because I sent it myself," was the reply.
"Did you also send the others on which you
have refreshed your memory by referring to
your book?"
The witness said that he had made them. He
did not recall that the Oregon" had made any
response to the signal to j that vessel: Hanna
also called attention to an entry in the signal
books at the Brooklyn and the St. Paul of a
message for Admiral Sampson. It appeared
that as read by the St. Paul the signal was
as follows:
"If Samnson comes here tell him that half
the sauadron is out of coal and that the en
gine of the collier Is broken down."
Upon reading the entry of this signal Lieu
tenant McCauley said that lt ran: "If Sampson
comes here tell him half of the squadron la
short of coal." He said, however, that the
word "short" was very Indistinct. The signal
to "close up" had, the witness said, remained
flying "until we discovered the Oregon on our
quarter." Several of the ships had their an
swering pennants flying; \u25a0 he remembered es
pecially that the Oregon had been among the
ships which had made no response.
Lieutenant McCauley was then excused and
Lieutenant Charles Webster was called. He
said he had been a watch officer on the Brook
lyn during the campaign of 1898 and began his
testimony by describing the blockade off Cien
fuegos. He thought the distance out at, night
was seven or eight miles, with picket 'boats
inside the line. The sea was moderate, he
said, between Cienfuegos and Sanitago on the
occasion of the flying squadron's voyage, mak
ing rough weather for the smaller vessels. The
custom at Santiago was to lie off the port four
or five miles during the day. The vessels
steamed back and forth at night about the same
distance out. Asked If he had seen any suspi
cious movements on shore at Santiago during
the evening of July 2, the witness replied:
"I remained on deck on July 2, and saw col
umns of smoke rising and apparently moving
as though vessels were steaming in the harbor.
Also in my watch I remember the burning. of
blockhouses to the westward of Santiago,
which I reported to the commanding officer."
"What was the conduct and bearing of Com
modore Schley in the different engagements
and on July 3?"
"I never saw Commodore Schley during the,
fight. I saw him, immediately after the battle
of July 3 and he was perfectly cool and con
tained."
Lieutenant Webster gave a brief account of
the battle of July 3. He "said that when the
signal was given to clear ship for action he
had run forward, having charge of the for
ward gun deck battery. He had then seen the
Texas and the Iowa a little abaft the Brook
lyn's beam. When the engines were started
the Brooklyn had headed directly toward the
harbor, the helm being changed frequently
until after firing was begun, when the helm
was put hard aport. He estimated that the
enemy's vessels were WOO to 1600 yards distant
when the Brooklyn began its turn and that
after the loop was completed it was 2300 yards,
increasing to 2S0O yards when the Vlscaya
turned In.
Speaking of the bombardment of the Colon,
May 31. the witness said he had observed it
from the Brooklyn and that while he had
noticed that the first shots fell short he had
seen one later which he thought had fallen
under the Colon's counter. He had got the
impression from this engagement that the shore
batteries \u25a0were stronger than they had pre
viously been supposed to be. He thought after
that time that those batteries were manned
with S-inch suns.
On cross-examination Captain Lemly had the
witness read from the log of the Brooklyn an
entry to the effect that the Brooklyn had
steamed out at night. The Judge advocate
asked only a few questions on his own ac
count, but put two or three at the instance, of
the court, as follows: '_ --
"When the flying squadron was bldckading
Cienfuegos did the column of vessels at night
keep on a line nearly perpendicular to the shore
line or on a line nearly parallel to the shore
line?"
"My recollection is .'that the line was per
pendicular to the'shore line."
"How did the Spanish ships bear from the
Brooklyn when the Brooklyn's helm' was put
hard aport July 3?"
'"It seems to me the Teresa, was nearly broad
on the port bow, the Viscaya perhaps three
points on the port bow. The helm had been
eased aport before that so it had changed their
bearings. It was hard to tell at the beginning
of the turn how they bore."
"What were the relative positions of the
Brooklyn and Colon when the Colon passed the
Viscaya? How was the Brooklyn heading at
this time?"
"The Colon passed inside the Viscaya at a
distance of about 2000 yards, so at that time
her range would have probably been 45G0 yards.
She bore the same bearing as the Colon at
that time, forward of the starboard beam,
about ten points. The Brooklyn was heading
probably nearly west."
The court adjourned until to-morrow.
Schley court of inquiry for
the entire day. The proceedings began
with the recall of Captain Cook and Lieu
tenant Commander Sears, both of whom
made material additions to their former
testimony, and they were followed in suc
cession by Commander N. E. Mason, who
was the executive officer of the Brooklyn;
Lieutenant Edward McCauley Jr.. who
v.-as signal officer, and Lieutenant Charles
"Webster, who had charge of the forward
jn deck battery of the Brooklyn during
the battle off Santiago and was a watch
officer en board that ship.
Captain Cook's new testimony related
to the uncoupling of the Brooklyn's en
gines and to the voyage of the flying
squadron from Cienfuegos to Santiago,
explaining: in some detail the cause of the
slow progress made on that occasion.
Commander Sears spoke again of the
conversation reported as having taken
p:ace between himself and officers of the
J.i&ssachusetts in the wardroom of that
vessel on May 31, in which he wa.s alleged
to have said that it had been difficult to
get Commodore Schley up to the point
of undertaking the bombardment of the
Colon, and he again denied that he had
said anything reflecting upon his superior
officer.
Commander Mason and Lieutenants Mc-
Cauley and "Webster all gave accounts of
the eneagrement of July 2. McCa-uley re
cited in detail the signals made in con
r-ection with that historical event at the
Instance of Commodore Schley. AH these
witnesses testified that the conduct of
the commodore when under fire was cool
and courageous.

The meaning of the word "humph" wai
recently the subject of judicial decision ir
the Irish Court of Appeal. Justice Mad

as used by Sir "Walter Sco.tt and Miss Aus

dissent, while the Lord Chief Justice and
Justice Burton inclined to the conclusior
that "humph" only meant a "dissatisfied
condition of the mind." The Court of Ap

expression of doubt or dissatisfaction,'
or, as Lord Justice Walker put it, in th<
words of the "Century Dictionary," "a
grunt of dissatisfaction."

'During the recent races for the America's cup three
systems of wireless telegraphy were used in making
reports, but, an expert from the Navy Department
who was detailed to note their comparative values
found that when the three systems were being
worked at the same time it was impossible to read
the messages of either of them. The. operators were
finally forced to divide time so that no two were in
operation simultaneously. Unless such interference
can be prevented there will be complications in the
future, for, should the ships of one country be signal
ing by one system and the ships of another country
begin with a different system neither signal could be
understood. It is a case where too many cooks
would not merely spoil the broth but spill it.
FROM the tenor of the speeches made at the
National Rivers and Harbors Congress, re
cently in session at Baltimore, it is evident that
some at least of the influential people of this
country have become convinced it is high time for
our Government to undertake the work of river and
harbor improvement according to a rational system
instead of leaving it to the hazard of log-rolling in
Congress. The Government has never been extrava
gant in the amount of money expended for such im
provements when considered as a whole, but it "has
every year wasted ironey by making expenditures
where they are of no value to commerce, while leav
ing unimproved many points upon which millions
might have been economically invested.
In .an address before the congress Chairman Bur
ton of the. House Committee on Rivers and Harbors
pointed out that during the four years from 1897 to
1901 the amounts appropriated for rivers and har
bors, including continuing contract appropriations,
were in the aggregate only $63,069,717. That sum is
certainly not excessive when the extent of our rivers
and harbors is taken into consideration. In fact, as
Mr. Burton said, it is but a fourth of the amount
appropriated during the same period for one arm of
the .military service.
Mr. Burton's plea was for liberality in appropriat
ing money for such improvements, but the liberality,
as he went on to say, should be exercised with dis
crimination. We should not scatter the money ac
cording to the demands of Congressmen striving
each to get an appropriation for his district, but it
should be applied where.it would be of use to the
nation as a whole. Mr. Burton laid down a good
rule on the subject in saving: "In view of the neces
sary limitations in the amounts appropriated in river
and harbor acts, and the pressing need for deeper
channels and improved facilities along established
lines of traffic, it is better to appropriate for localities
where .traffic is already established than where it is
uncertain or problematical. It is more business
like to finish one and obtain results from it than to
make piecemeal appropriations upon all."
A similar solution for the problem was offered by*
Mr. Schermerhorn of the Philadelphia Board â¢ of
Trade, who,' in describing an "ideal river and harbor
bill," said: "It would provide for a careful classifi
cation of these improvements in the order of their
relative importance to the interests of the country
from the broadest and most comprehensive stand
point. It would provide for the rapid and system
atic improvement of these works in the order of their

PERSONAL MENTION.
SECRETARY E. H. BENJAMIN has
received returns from the mining
counties of the State sufficient to
warrant the conclusion that 503 del-
The Junior Order of American Mechanics has
passed this action: "Resolved, That we will not pur
chase, read or advertise in the New York Journal,
and we call on our friends to do likewise, as an ex
pression of. our contempt for Hearst, the miserable
owner and editor of that dirty, filthy sheet."
That is a bit emphatic, but the action has been fol
lowed by "The Woodmen of the World," one of the
largest beneficial orders in this country. All of these
seem to have seen through Mr. Hearst's disguise as
the guardian and defender of the American home and
American youth. He puts himself forward. as a
â¢ benevolent benefactor, a beaming, blooming play
mate of the girls and boys, but their parents are call
ing them into the house and shutting the door in his
face. The wolf invites the lamb to promenade, but
the lamb declines.
The Bishops of the Episcopal church have quite
generaily sounded the note of alarm against that yel
low journalism. One says, "It stands for the corrup
tion of public morals and the debauchery of political
honor"; another, "It is the duty of the church to
emphasize in every possible way the great harm done
by such journalism to law and public morals"; an
other, that "its effect is bad and pernicious, and for
the future of the country means greater wrong un
less promptly checked and suppressed"; another,
that "it is perilous and demoralizing to sound public
policy"; another, that "it is the firebrand of
the age. Its suppression is vital to the in
terests of stable government"; another, that "it
subverts truth and presents an unreal picture
of society." Others of these eminent Bishops say
that Hearst's style of journalism "is a disgrace to the
country, a moral, social and political injury"; that
"it is repugnant to the minds of right feeling persons,
panders to the passions of the unthinking and incites
to deeds of wrong"; "it is selfish in purpose and de
moralizing in effect"; ''public morality demands that
no half-way steps be taken to check its blighting in
fluence"; "measures should be taken by every
righteously minded citizen to suppress it for all
time"; "its malignant sentiments have wrought a
world of injury."
These are but a small part of the expressions of
these eminent churchmen upon the character of
Hearst's papers, and incidentally of himself as the
protector of American mothers and children. The
outspoken country* press holds to the same view, and
pages of its expressions are condensed in this, from
the Advertiser^ of Elmira, N. Y.: "The first essen
tial is to be sure that the educators are of the right
order. At the mother's knee comes the first lesson.
Let the yellow journal be excluded from the home.
Teach the boys and girls to be true. Pure reading
and clean speech will help to make pure hearts and
clean lives."
IX the proclamation declarative of their guardian
ship of the American people the Hearst papers
assured the mothers of the country of their pro
lection and took their children in charge to be
brought up in the way they should go, so that when
they get old they will not depart therefrom.
To this magnanimous offer there has not been a
general response accepting Mr. Hearst in loco pa
rentis. The Young Men's Christian Associations
all over the country, which are supposed, to speak
somewhat definitely for American homes and . the
young therein, have excluded all of his papers and
branded them as injurious to the public order, peace
and morality. The clergy of the country of all de
nominations 2re supposed to have a keen interest in
the children of the people, and they have expressed
the liveliest solicitude that the young be protected
against the contamination of Hearst's style of jour
nalism.
DETECTED IN DISGUISE.
DISPATCHES from London announce that the
Constantinople correspondent of the Daily
Telegraph reports it is believed in the Turk
ish capital that the United States* Government will in
sist that Turkey shall repay whatever amount is found
necessary to ransoni Miss Stone. Another telegram
from "Constantinople is to the effect that the Russian
Government has expressed a desire to assist the
United States in rescuing the abducted missionary.
The reports of course cannot be regarded as abso
lutely reliable, but they open up an interesting phase
of the situation.
The men who captured Miss Stone and her com
panion and who have demanded for their release such
a high ransoni may be no more than Bulgarian ban
dits, and should such prove to be the case it is. not
likely any international complications will ensue.
There have been, however, many evidences tending
to confirm the report that the bandits are acting in
connection with the "Macedonian committee," a set
of men who for years past have been trying'to raise
a war in the Balkans in the expectation that it would
result in a further^ dismemberment of the Turkish
empire. The committee is avowedly -revolutionary,
and no one suspects it of being overscrupulous in
the means it employs to obtain money or to incite
strife. It is therefore not altogether improbable that
the committee may have had something to do with
the bandits who have so securely hidden Miss Stone
in the recesses of the mountains.
Should the developments of the case prove com
plicity on the part of the Macedonian committee
there would then be cause of a genuine international
complication, for it is well known the committee has
direct dealings with the Russian Government. "In"
fact, it is generally believed in Europe that the real
headquarters of the committee is at St. Petersburg,
that its members arc in the pay of the Czar, and that
its activities are designed more for the purpose of
giving Russia an excuse for interfering in Turkey
than for anything else. It will be seen that if this
theory be true Russia might well afford to be prompt
in offering aid to the United States. Her Govern
ment could with little trouble bring sufficient pres
sure to bear upon the Macedonian committee to force
it to surrender -Miss Stone even without a ransom,
and it would be to her advantage to do so, for she
could thus display herself before the world as the pro
tector of Christians in the Turkish empire.
Of course too much credit is not to be given to any
of these reports. The entire population of the Balkan
Peninsula appears to be involved in a network of
conspiracies of one kind or another. Between revo
lutionists and bandits there is probably not much dif
ference. The very man who is conspiring for liberty
and religion to-day may be conspiring for robbery
and loot to-morrow. The men who are carrying on
political intrigues are doubtless*, in many instances
the same who are acting as the leaders of brigands
and bdndits.
In the. meantime the Turkish Government is in a
bad fix. The bandits have given notice that if they
are pursued by i troops they will kill the women.
Thus if the Sultan be vigorous he may lead to the
death of the unfortunate captives, while if he neglects
to exert the utmost energy he will naturally be held
responsible for the success of the robbers. ,He will
have, however, little sympathy. More and more it
is becoming evident that a strong government is
needed in. the Balkans to keep the peace, and it is
clear the Turk will never again be in a position to
exert that power.
THE CASE OF MISS STONE.
In a recent desperate feud between fighting Ken
tucky families four men were killed and five, were
dangerously wounded. The most pleasant feature of
the interesting affair was that no non-combatant was
injured and the tone of the population has been meas
urably improved.
WHILE it is inevitable that in the present
municipal contest the public will be inter
ested mainly in the struggle for the May
oralty, it will not be overlooked by intelligent voters
that the election of a good Board of Supervisors i3
not less important than the election of the best man
to the Mayoralty. It is to the Supervisors we must
look for the ordinances by which the city is to be
governed, and past experience has amply proven
that corruption in the board is about as disastrous as
it could be in the Mayor's office.
.It should not be difficult for good citizens to make
choice of which ticket of Supervisors to vote for.
As has been pointed out in The Call, there are good
elements and there are bad elements on each ticket,
but there is this notable difference between the nomi
nees for Supervisors by .the two regular parties â on
the Democratic ticket there is a maximum of good
elements and a minimum of bad, while on the ticket
that has been put forward by a set of scheming
bosses under the Republican name there is a maxi
mum of bad elements and a minimum of good N
The contrast between the personal character of the
two tickets is in itself sufficient to lead all citizens
who have a high regard for the welfare of the city
to vote for the Democratic Supervisors, but there is
a further factor of importance that must be taken into
consideration. The Republican candidates for Super
visor were nominated by v a clique of political bosses
who are in close relations with certain corporations
to whom Supervisors can render favors. The candi
dates, therefore, were in advance of their nomination
pledged to the corporations. If elected they will enter
office not to serve the city but to serve the corpora
tions, who wish to make money out of the city.
It is to be noted, further, that had the corporations
desired to. obtain from the Supervisors nothing but
what honest and upright citizens would be willing to
grant, it would not have been difficult for them to
get good men to accept the nominations. The very
fact that they nominated so many unfit men for the
position of Supervisor is itself an evidence that their
schemes are as bad as the men they have selected to
carry them out.
The Democratic nominees have been tried in office.
Their proceedings in the past have not been always
approved by all citizens, but there has been no ugly
scandal arising from any of their actions. The record
of the board has, in fact, been one of which the mem
bers may be justly proud. The Call is not a supporter
of.the Democratic party, nor of the Democratic ad
ministration of the city, nevertheless it quite willingly
bears witness to the excellence of the service which
this Democratic board has rendered the community.
Under any circumstances such men might with jus
tice appeal to their fellow citizens for approval and
indorsement, but in this case the appeal is made with
double force because to reject these men who have
been faithful in office for the sake of electing a set
of pledged henchmen of corporations and political
bosses would be on the part of the voters themselves
a repudiation of good government.
It will of course be difficult for stanch Repub
licans to break away from their party, and The Call
fully understands and sympathizes with the feeling
of party loyalty which creates the difficulty. In this
case, however, the issue should not be considered a
partisan one. The men who controlled the Repub
lican convention did not represent ' Republicanism,
neither did they care anything about it. Their sole
object was to get possession of the city government,
through the Board of -Supervisors, so that they
might use it for their own purposes. Republicans,
therefore, can do no better service to their party
than to repudiate these candidates of the bosses.
Should the corporation candidates for Supervisor be
elected the Republican party would be held respon
sible for their actions, good, bad and indifferent.
Sound Republicanism, therefore, as well as good
citizenship, requires the defeat of the corporation
ticket. No loyal Republican will consent to make the
party responsible for such a gang.
SELECTION OF SUPERVISORS.
Some carefully considered systematic programme
of; river and harbor work such as was suggested by
the Baltimore congress would doubtless have the ap
proval of the great mass of the American people. It
would, however, have the antagonism of Congress
men seeking appropriations for the creeks of their
districts, and its adoption by Congress could not be
obtained without a long preliminary campaign of
education. In the end, however, something of that
kind must be done. The steamships of our time are
rapidly increasing in size. They are already so large
that comparatively few harbors are deep enough to
receive them. Harbor improvement, therefore, is
enforced upon all the great commercial nations of
the globe.
Experience has proven that in the economy of our
time it is cheaper to fit the harbor to the big ship
than to use small vessels that are fitted for shallow
harbors. It was estimated by one speaker at the
congress, Mr. Lincoln of Boston, that the saving in
ocean freights to the American people by reason of
the increased tonnage of ships lias amounted in the
last twenty years to upward of $300,000,000. That
sum will go far to repay all the harbor improvements
we need for many years. Therefore the fight for
systematic river and harbor improvement ought to
begin at once and be prosecuted vigorously.

REDDING, Oct. 16.â Within a year the
residents of Shasta County may witness,
it is said, the establishment of one of the
largest lumbering enterprises on the Pa

construction of a railroad lino connecting
the county seat with the extreme north
western section of the county, with the
possible extension of the road Into a
transcontinental Lne.
For many months past Chester L.
Hovey, it is said, has been buying timber
land throughout the northwestern portion
of the county. It is claimed that he ha3
bought thousands of acres. Hovey is said
to be the representative of the great saw-,
mill syndicate of Minnesota which is
headed by Thomas B. Walker.
It is said that another representative of
the Walker syndicate will be here before
the new year to investigate the proposi
tion of building a railroad connecting the
main line of the Southern Pacific in this
county and extending up Pit River at
least as far as Fall River Mills. The en
gineer corps of the syndicate has spent
the past summer in surveying routes' for
a railroad. Lines were run from the Mc-
Cloud River in Siskiyou County to Fall
River Mills and from Fall River Mills by
two routes toward -this city. One of the
routes passes through the Hatchet Creek
mountain pass; the other down the Pit
River. It is declared that the river route
is the only feasible one, and the location
of^he lands purchased by Hovey would
indicate that it had been accepted.

Legislation having this end in view is
recommended. The report urges an in
vestigation into the question of timber
entries in Hawaii and recommends the
establishment of a system for forestry
preservation. Better statistics regarding
imports and exports and similar matters
are urged. The gradual destruction of
the fisheries Is pointed out and a recom

Approximately the same proportion of
entries and departures holds good with
respect to Chinese and other labor, mak

The report makes a number of import

treatment of the labor question. Cooper

situation -of Miss Ellen M. Stone. Secre
tary Eddy of the legation at Constanti

Sorta are making determined efforts to
locate the woman. Apparently they have
not been successful, for they have not
communicated with the State Depart

is good news. Upon being assured that
the pursuit by Government troops has
been stopped, it is believed here that the
brigands will renew negotiations with
Eddy for Miss Stone's liberation.

of the leaders of the brigands, Naby Bey
says, are dismissed Russian officers.

Every SuiTerer from Catirrh Knows that
Salves, Lotions, Washes, I prays and
Torches Dd Not Cure. *
PoTrders, lotions, salve?, sprays and In-
halers cannot really cure Catarrh, because
this disease is a blood disease, and local
applications. If *hey accomplish anything
at all, simply give transient relief.
The catarrnal poison Is in the blood and
the mucous membrane of the nose, throat
end trachea tries to relieve the system by
eecretlr.g- large quantities of mucus, the
discharge sometimes closing up the nos-
trils, dropping Into the throat, causing
deafness by closing: the Eustacblan tubes,
and after a time causing catarrh of stom-
ach or eerlous throat and lung troubles.
A remedy to really cure catarrh must be
&n Internal remedy which will cleanse the
blood from catarrhal poison, and remove
the fever and congestion from the mucou3
membrane.
The best and most modern remedies for
this purpose are antiseptics scientifically
known as EucaJyptol, Guaiacol, Ban-
jruinarla and Hydrastin, and while each
cf these has been successfully used sep-
arately, yet it has been difficult to get
them all combined in one palatable, con-
venient and efficient form.
The manufacturers of the new catarrh
cure, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, have suc-
ceeded admirably in accomplishing this
result. They axe large, pleasant tasting
lczenges, to be dissolved in the mouth,
thus reaching every part of the mucous
membrane of the throat and finally the '
stomach.
Unl'ke many catarrh remedies, Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate
or any injurious drug whatever and are
equally beneficial for little children and
adults.
Mr. C. R. Rembrandt of Rochester. N.
T., eays: "I know of few people who have
suffered as much as I from. Catarrh of
the head, throat and stomach. I used ,
sprays, inhalers and powders for months
at a time with only slight relief, and had
no hope of cure. I had not the means to
make a change of climate, which seemed
my only chance of cure.
"Last spring I read an account of some
remarkable cures made by Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and promptly bought a
fifty-cent box from my druggist and ob-
tained such positive benefit from that one
package that I continued to use them
daily until I now consider myself entirely
free from the disgusting annoyance of ca-
tarrh; my head is clear, my digestion all I
crjuid ask and my hearing, which had be-
gun to fail as a result of the catarrh, has
1 greatly improved until I feel I can hear as
well as ever. They are a household neces-
sity in my family."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by
druggists at 50 cents for complete treat-
ment, and for convenience, safety and
prompt results they are undoubtedly the
lor.g-looked-for catarrh cure.

Besults of Events on Some of the Big
RACES IN THE EAST.
As it happened Carter had a narrow es
cape from defeat. His head had not thor
oughly cleared when the gong sounded at
the opening of the seventh round and
his seconds fairly lifted him out of his
cha;r and pushed him into the center of
the ring. He nearly fell to the floor. This
was the chance Walcott overlooked.
It developed yesterday that Carter took
all the gallop oui of his dusky opponent
with a right hand to the body when they
met in the center of the ring for the first
time in the opening round. Walcott had
a smile on his face after this, but
it v.'as all a fham. He was decidediy un
happy. When Carter came back at him in
the seventh after the terrible beating
Walcott had given him In the previous
round it proved too much for him. The
blow on the pit of the stomach convinced
him there were easier ways of earning
money than fighting for the winner's
share with "Kid" Carter.
iladden demurred to this and Delaney
at once accepted Corbett. He is to be
Â»a!d $500 tor his services, the money to
be deducted from the gross receipts, each
fighter and the club inus paying a por
tion of the money. This was the amount
originally set aside for George Buer of
Chicago, "who was the rlrst man mentioned
lor the position. It was to cover both hia
expenses and his compensation.
The managers of the lighters each an
nounced that his man v.-ould be ready to
meet Fltzsimmons in this city in Uecem
ber, providing he wa?> not injured in the
forthcoming light. Manager Gleason was
authorized to communicate with Fitzsim
mons and enter into negotiations with
him. If ntz is not ready to re-Â«nter the
ring the men are willing that Tom Shar
key should take his place.
Carter and Walcott were about yester
day showing but few signs of the previous
eight's battle. Walcott is anxious for an
other meeting with the hard hitting
"Kid." He oilers to fight him, the re
ceipts to go to charity. It is not likely
they will meet here for some time, if at
all. Carter r**ceived $2000 as his share of
the re<>eipts, Walcott getting $7l>0. It was
originally arranged that the winner take
ail, thls_being Walcott's proposition. The
"Kid's" irlends held out for a loser's end,
which Walcott will have the privilege of
spending.
Harry Corbett will referee the Jeffries-
Ruhlin fight on the night of November 15
at Mechanics' Pavilion.
He was selected yesterday by "Billy"
I>elaney, representing the champion, and
"Billy" Madden, who acted for Ruhlin.
There was no haggling over the matter.
When Delaney was asked what men he
had in mind he suggested Ned Homan
and "Jack" Welsh. Madden mentioned
Corbett. There was some good-natured
bantering, Deianey suggesting that each
select a man and then shake dice to see
whose choice should be the third man in
the ring when the championship battle
commences.
Walcott Is Anxious for
Another Meeting With
Carter.

THE draw for the John Grace Chal
lenge cup stake, which will be
run at Union Coursing Park on
Saturday and Sunday, was held
last night at Pythian Castle.
This is the richest stake for grey
hounds held in Amerlqa. Last year it
was worth SSC19. and it was intended this
year to make it $12,000. This would have
been made up of 5G000 in entrance fees
and a like amount added by the Union
Coursing Park .Association. The strike
had a blighting "effect on coursing and the
stake was reduced in size and value. The
dogs are of the highest class ever brought
together on an American coursing field.
Palo Alto Is favorite owing to a brilliant
trial he ran last Monday. Next to him
in favor are the Curtis dogs, Beacon and
Rector. The prizes will be: To the win
ner $600, runner-up $300, third dog $200,
next three $100 each, next six $50 each,
next twelve $25 each. The twenty-four
dogs beaten in the first round on Satur
day will compete in a consolation stake

The bicycle Industry of this country 13
apparently in desperate straits. The
sport and pastime which spread through
the United States like magic In the early
90's, holding young and old, rich and poor
in its thrall, shows signs of dire distress.
Announcements made yesterday in this
city by officers of the American Bicycle
Company, the $40,000,000 corporation which
absorbed the principal factories of the
country at the height of the boom, show
what a change has come over the affairs
of the corporation since the boom sub
sided.
It was officially announced that the af
fairs of the company would all be merged
under control of one manager for the Pa
cific Coast. O. C. Hutchinson of Chicago
is the man selected for the position. He
will assume charge on the 1st of Novem
ber. Under him will be one set of travel
ing men, ' one set of clerks and one set
of mechanics, assuming the duties of the
several sets of men now employed. Among
the well-known men who are consolidated
out are P. H. Bernays and S. C. Chapman,
who have succpssfully managed import
ant branch houses here for many years.
When the American Bicycle Company
absorbed the big factories they controlled
and made forty-eight different wheels.
This number has been reduced already
and a further sweeping reduction will be
made at once. There will be marketed
not to exceed seven different types next
year by the company. Such well-known
wheels as the Stearns, Barnes and Spald
lng will not be made hereafter.
This coast has been the j best market
in the country during the past year, the
wholesale agency in this city disposing of
6000 bicycles and showing a *prottt on the
year's trading. The officers in New York
nave given out a statement that the cor
poration's losses for the year ending
August 1 are $2,000,000. \u25a0
The big corporation, when formed, had
a list of officers as formidable as any
great railway system could boast. There
were several vice presidents, a board of
directors, managers, auditors and others.
Its magnificent offices in New York occu
pied an entire floor in one of the great
buildings, at a rental of more than $70,000
a year. Expenses- aro being curtailed
throughout the country wherever possible
in an effort to save something out of the
wreck.
A local dealer, who returned recently
from the East, was so impressed with
conditions thev-j that he cut down his
force of employes to the smallest force
consistent with handling his business .at
present. ' _.. i

Captain Womble, who for the last three
years has played right end on the varsity,
is now playing at rigrht half. "With Du

fornia has three star men back of the line.
To-morrow afternoon the freshman
eleven will play a practice gamÂ© with the
Berkeley High School, when, it will close
its heavy practice prior to its meet with
the Stanford freshmen on Saturday. The
coaches are devoting all their energy
toward getting the freshmen in condition
for the contest. This afternoon the baby
class team lined up with the second
eleven for hard practice.
Those declared eligible for varsity po
sitions are as follows:
â¢ Centerâ Gendottl, Morehead, Phillips, Burke.
Guardsâ Overall, Stowe, CToole, Hendrlcks,

Eligible for Varsity Team.
A list of fifty-nine University of Cali
fornia football men eligible to play in the
contest with Stanford on November 9 has
been prepared by Graduate Manager De
coto and sent to the Stanford athletic
committee. This committee will examine
the list with a view toward protesting
any man deemed Ineligible, although Cal
ifornia does not look for an objection to
any of the players named.
The line-up will be as follows:
Burke, center; Heitmuller or Cummlngs, right
guard; Stroud, left guard; Gastrich, right
tackle; "Wilson, left tackle; Demerrit, right
end; Gage or Edwards, left end; Saeltzer (cap
tain), quarter; Kelsey, right half; Risler, left
half: Bush, fullback.
The California rooters will attend the
game In a body and will lend their lung
and moral support to the freshmen. "With
cheers and songs they will do what they
can toward helping the freshmen gain- a
victory.
Booters Will Attend in a Body.
The freshmen have a gritty captain in
Quarterback Dudley Saeltzer. He plays
fast and well, but is not certain at all
times. He has shown much ability in
managing the team, and his head work
has been good during all preliminary
games. Stroud is a heavy man and plays
well at left guard. Demerrit at right end
has also been doing good work, and back
of the line Risley, Kelsey and Bush make

\u25a0 Some startling revelations are promised
when the , suit brought by George H.
Cross, a member of the firm of Faber &
Co., grocers, 119 Taylor street, for the an
nulment; of his marriage, with Miss Lor
etta Newbert comes up for trial In the
Superior Court. There is a case pending
before Police Judge Conlan against Cross
for failure to provide for his child, aiid
ex- Judge Ferral has been engaged to
prosecute. \
' Cross makes the allegation in his com
plaint for annulment of the marriage that
he was. forced into it at the point of a
revolver by Bernard Conlon, a brother-in
law of the bride, and Policeman James
Cook on the night of July 10 before Jus
tice of the Peace Groezinger. Conlon in
speaking of . the matter yesterday said:
"It is not true that he was forced into
the marriage. At his request I called at
the grocery, 119 Taylor street, and in the
presence of a number of people he asked,
me to procure a marriage license. He'
gave me a written order to that effect giv
ing his full name and age. I got the li
cense, and it was agreed that the cere
mony should be performed by Justice
Groezinger at 8 o'clock that night in his
chambers. Cross was late in making his
appearance and the Judge had a theater
engagement, so we waited till after the
performance, and the marriage took place
shortly before midnight. I had him ar
rested, however, as I believed he intended
leaving the city. A child was born in
August, but Cross has . done nothing co
support it or his wife. I understand he
has promised to marry another girl In
November. , .

BITTEB FIGHT OVER
A HASTY MAB-RIAGE
A week's courtship, a honeymoon that
destroyed illusions, a month more of tem
pestuous married life, and a year, now
nearly one-third gone, of waiting till di
vorce proceedings can be instituted â such
are the experiences, which, crowding- Into
the life of Miss Edna Lewis that was,
sister of Gertrude Lewis, the actress, have
set society in Ban Francisco and stageland
in New York talking 1 . The unhappy young
wife, Mrs. Jonas L. Hazelton, or Mrs.
Edna Lewis, as she desires now to be
known. Is living quietly with her parents
at their home On Washington street, near
Franklin, turning a deaf ear to gossip and
waiting till she may bring suit for divorce.
The husband Is managing his theaters In
New York and saying unchlvalrous things
of the wife who left him.
Miss Lewis was but 17 when Â»hÂ© met
Hazelton last February In New York. His
wooing was torrid and. after a week's ac
quaintance the two were wed February
25. \u25a0 She was not 18 until March 8, but her
mother, Mrs. William Lewis, and Ger
trude Lewis, her sister, were present and
willing to make the best of the girl's
hasty marriage.
After; a Week's Courtship.
Miss Lewis had 'been, with her sister,
leading. lady of Daniel Frohrrian's "Near
the Throne" company, in her. tour of the
principal Eastern cities the previous sea
son and was again making the tour with
her, though she had no stage aspirations
herself. In New York she met Hazelton,
26 years old and handsome, the lessee and
manager of two theaters in Syracuse, one
In Rochester . and" one in Oswego. Hazel
ton was at. once Infatuated with the beau
tiful Californienne, and at the end of a
week's courtship he gained her consent to
an Immediate marriage. There was an
extensive honeymoon trip and the stun
ning blonde bride was much- admired.
. The friends here of the former" -Miss
Lewis were much, surprised early in July
by her sudden return to her parents. She
and her mother went at once to Highland
Springs and when her husband arrived ic
San Francisco some days later to try to
Induce his wife to return to him he Was
unable to see her, as she refused to. meet
him or to consider his efforts at recon
ciliation. . .
Says His Tales Are False.
Hazelton then began circulating stories
of her conduct during their brief married
life, stories which she brands as wholly
false and invented by him out of revenge
for her refusal to return to- him. â¢.
By- her marriage in New York Mlsa
Lewis lost her residence in San Francisco
and in conseauence she must wait until
next July before she can bring suit for
divorce. Just as soon as possible she will
commence action and she asserts there
are grounds a-plenty. She says her hus-
President Case of the Shipwrights' and
Calkers 1 Union candidly admitted last
night that the strike was a failure. He
said further that the majority of the
members of the union, being married men.
hailed the settlement cf the strike at any
terms with pleasure. He resumed:
Many of the men were In sore straits, and
they were growing very rest!Â«>*s. Every at
tempt at a compromipe met with failure, and
the result was that the more timid began to
desert the union, while ethers returned to
\u25a0work. As the situation was virtually hopeless,
;."ViÂ« decided to come to some settlement at any
cost. The management of the Union and Ris
<5o!i Works treated us with great courtesy, but
they positively refused to grant the term's for
which we contended. We final!;,- pave way to
pressure and came to terms. We lost our
fifrht and we wilj accept our defeat with for
titude. How our action will affect the ma
chinists 1 ' strike I have no means of know
ing, but I do not think it will benefit their
ctuse. Judging by what I saw and heard <3ur
lns our negotiations for settlement I have ar
rived at the conclusion that the machinists'
fight Is hopeless.
While the management of the Union
end Risdon works are jubilant at ' the
abandonment by the shipwrights of their
fight, they say little. They express the
belief however, that the machinists'
strike Js disintegrating- slowly and that
the action of the shipwrights will hasten
the end of the trouble. The return of the
Fixty men will ease matters considerably
at both works, and in a measure provide
the Iron men with additional munitions of
war against the striking machinists. It
Is believed that the ship joiners, fitters,
riveters, boiler makers and pattern mak
ers who are still out will eoorr<lroD in line
with the ship-n-rights. several committees
from those bodies having already inquired
nsto t"3rms of settlement.
When these terms had been thoroughly
discussed and agreed to by the iron men
and representatives of the union, the
committee immediately called a special
meeting of the union and the recommen
dation was made that the terms be ac
cepted. The union thereupon adopted a
resolution declaring the strike oft" and
instructing members to return to work at
their own convenience.
The effect of the action was the return
to the Union Iron Works of thirty men
yesterday morning. At the same time a
like number joined the forces at the Ris
don Iron Works. In the latter works
about eighty shipwrights were employed
before the strike in May. Captain Taylor
announced that he could not immediately
take back all his old force, but thought
the men could be given places within the
next two weeks. Inasmuch as the Union
Iron Works Is doing considerable repair
work on transports and other vessels. It is
thought -a largely increased force of ship
wrights as well as calkers will be re
quired within a few days.
Strike Is a Failure.
That in the event of the machinists winning
thiir fijtht for nine hours with ten hours' pay,
the shipwrights and calkers shall be allowed the
same terms.
That the union be recognized as a body, the
emj.lojers agreeing not to discriminate against
union shipwrights and calkers because of their
fcff.liatiou with the union.
That all union shipwrights and calkers be re
instated to their old jjositions on application, or
as s<xm thereafter as conditions will allow
their employment.
That the oid schedule of wages, namely, $3 75
a .lay for new work and Si 40 a day for old
v.ork, remain in force pending the determina
tion of the machinists' strike.
A severe blow was dealt the machinists'
strike yesterday when the news was made
public that the members of Shipwrights'
and Calkers' Union No. 9162 had formal
ly resolved on Tuesday to declare off their
strike for nine hours with ten hours' pay.
That the information, was correct was
demonstrated at the Union and Klsdon
Iron Works during the morning, whea
some sixty men, who walked out with
the machinists on May 20, applied for
and were given work at the old terms.
The action of tne shipwrights was not
unexpected by the iron men. The mat
ter of returning to work had been dis
cussed for several weeks in the union,
*tnd aji early break v.-as- looked for. Con
sequently, when a committee of the union
three weeks ago began overtures by ask
ing on what terms peace might be re
stored, the iron men felt that the end
\u25a0was near. Several consultations were
had. and the terms fully discussed. On
Tuesday the final meeting of the commit
tee of shipwrights, consisting of Edward
Case, president of the union; Alexander
Cunningham and Charles Maury and Ir
ving M. Sccti cf the Union Iron Works

Works -.vas hela. The following agree
ment was reached and accepted as linal
by both factions:

their kindly interest and assured them
that, bo far as he has been able to ascer

1 It is safe to say that the majority of
bald men of to-day would gladly revive
tho old, dignified custom if they could.
But they can do the, next best thing to
it; that is, to revive the growth of the
hair nature gave them.
In cases where the hair root or hair
bulb has not been, completely destroyed
by parasites that Infest it, Ne-wbro's Her-
picide will do wonders in the, way of stim-
ulating the growth" of lifeless and failing
hair. .Destroy the cause, you remove the
effect! That is the successful mission of
Herplcide. , :

Write plain. Feasible letters, giving de-
tailed facts of Ill-health caused from im-
proper food and explain the Improvement,
the gain in strength, In weight, or in

It Is a profound fact that most alls of
humanity' come from Improper and non-
nourishing food, euch as white bread, hot
biscuit, starchy and uncooked cereals,
etc
A change to perfectly cooked, predi-
gested food like Grape-Nuts, scientifically

a well person. Food, good food. Is
Nature's strongest weapon of defense. I

not very well, to whom we can write re-
garding the food cure by Grape-ICuts.
Almdst every one interested In pure
food is willing to have his or her name
appear In the papers for euch help as
they may offer the human race. A re-
quest, however, to omit name will be re-
epected. Try for one of the 330 prizes.
Every one has an equal chow. Don't

esting facts about the good you have ob-
tained from tbe pure food Grape-Nuts.

TO THE MAN WHO THINKS.
pgl^OOK yourself squarely in the face and see
if you are riot half ashamed to be without
ij^gP Ivory Soap in your house. Wcrse than this,
l'**?^?J your wife is without it. It is bad enough
for a man, though a man often doesn't care how
his comfort is mis-spelled. But a woman misses all
these little helps to housekeeping.. And Ivory Soap
is one; its great potency makes it actually cheaper
than yellow soap for general work. It floats.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Oct. 16.â Wheat acted with some
buoyancy at the opening, under the Influence
oÂ£ Liverpool cables, which came in unchanged
on the break of >ic from top prices here yester
day. December opened Vkc to %c advanced at
70^<fr70^ic. but could not get higher. When it
was found that the demand was only a scat
tered one, selling became somewhat concen
trated and a few prominent bulls began to let
go of their holdings. In the absence of any
important news and with no outside demand,
dullness set in, followed by liquidations which
brought a slump in December prices to 69%c.
Despite the fact that receipts were the smallest
for any corresponding day In the past ten
years and that northwestern receipts have not
Improved to any extent, there was practically
no rally. December closed weak, ,%@ a />c de
pressed, at e9"i@70c.
Corn was quiet and fluctuated within a range
of Uc. \u25a0 Trading was confined almost entirely
to the scalping element. December closed
rather weak, H@%c down, at 56%c. .
Oats were : asain profoundly dull. December
elbsed steady, a shade higher, at 35V4@35Vic. '
Hog products ruled steady with higher teft
dencies, based on a strong hog market. There
was a fair demand at times from shorts, as
well- as some demand for lard and ribs from
commission houses. January pork closed 17VJC
higher, lard 7Vi@10c up and ribs Be higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:'. .

decided change, In the tenor of the seaboard
advices, all now reporting an improved^ demand

fell at one time 2% under, yesterday aad closed
at a net loss of 2 points. The break In Amal
gamated Copper interrupted an incipient rise
in Pennsylvania and Its allied stocks, prompted
by the sale oi 120,000,000 bonds by the company.
This was held to account for the large buying
of stock yesterday. The effect of to-day's an
nouncement, however, afforded little oppor
tunity tor profit-taking on yesterday's pur
chase, altiousrh much interest was " unown as
to tlie purpose to , which the proceeds ot the
bonds would bo applied. As the purchases of
stocks of other railroads so far as officially
acknowledged by the company has been pro
vided for by the additional stock Issues, it was
Bupposed that the purchase of control of the
Cambria Eteel Company was -being provided
for. Bullish operators spread reports that pur
chases of Atchison were in contemplation by
Penneylvanla. but there was no response in the
speculation. The market r-howed a tendency
toward stagnation during the alternoon. until
a sharp raid against the Southwesterly later
in the day awakened some degree of activity at
the expense of values. Losses of from 1 to 2%
were made by practically all the members ot
the group. Bear operators professed to detect
evidences of inside selllne. which waa attrib
uted to the account of the interest dominant
in the group, and supposed to be prompted by
poor outlook for trs35e on account of bad crops.
The money question continues a somewhat de
pressing influence. A transfer through the
sub-treasury to-day of $250,000 to New Orleans
adds to the apprehension that the belated move
ment of cotton will cause large requirements
in the South. The emphatic denials of Presi
dent Hill of last week's rumors of transcon
tinental railroad consolidations was another
chilling influence en the speculation. The mar
ket was weak until the room-traders took their
profits by covering their short contracts. Sales
of Lake Sliore at S0O, a record price, was an
incident. Total sales, 477,900 shares.
Railroad bonds were less active than yester
day and were irregular. Total sales, par value,

NEW YORK, Oct. IS.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market was heavy in the absence
of business and Americans sluggish, London
merely waiting: for New York to take the Initi
ative in the department. The feature was a
spurt in Norfolk & Western on the curb after
the close of the regular business sesnion. 1 Rio
Tintos fell to 4<% on Butte & Boston dividend
action, but rallied to 41Mi en a rise of 10
shillings in copper and strong fortnightly sta
tistics showing a decrease in stocks of 2800 tons
and in supplies of 2229 tons. London is talking
of a corner in the metal and there is Â£1 back
ward action already.
Discounts rule steady.
Gold to the amount of Â£5000 has been engaged
from Roumanla. The price of bars has been
raised to 77s ll%d.

Current bills of the Contra Costa Water
Company for supplying the Chabot Ob
servatory and the Oakland and the Cen
tral High School buildings have been re
jected by City Auditor Breed. The Audi
tor has also refused to allow bills for
water furnished the Health Department,
his reasons in all of tness cases being re
cited in a communication which was filed
to-day with the Board of Education and
the Board of Health.
The Auditor insists that the bills are
illegal claims because there exists no con
tract between the city and the water com
pany to supply water. He also maintains
that the company has failed to pay the
license tax due to the city under ordi
nance, and he finally declares that he hag
numerous other reasons which were
brought out during the argument in the
mandamus suit which ths company
brought against him.
Refusal to audit those bills, as well as
others which have been filed with the
Board of Public Works, has led that body
to take action. Instead of continuing t.T
hold the bills in their possession pending
a settlement of the legal difficulties in
volved the Commissioners to-day ordered
the rejected claims returned to the va
riuus departments from which the ac
counts were sent. Whether the . bills can
be taken up by the City Council and or
dered paid is another phase of the fight
that was given light to-day. But it is
just as certain that no matter which de
partment of the city government shall
approve the bills the Auditor will con
tinue to refuse to audit them until thers
has been a final judicial opinion rendered
upon the disputed questions. '

By prearrangement fifty men met at
the power house at Forty-seventh and

night and expressed their feeling against
De Cascia by stuffing an old uniform with
straw, labeling it and running It up to
the wire support. After accomplishing
their purpose the men dispersed to their
homes and nobody knew ot their visita

saw the figure swinging in the breeze.
De Cascia's fellow employes have taken
a dislike to him since his refusal to in
any way express sorrow for the death of.
Conductor Edward Thar3ing, who -was
killed by falling off his car. De Cascia
and Tharsing had been motorman and
conductor on the same car for several
.years. They were together when Thai
slng met his death and were members of
the same fraternal order, yet De Cascia
refused to contribute a cent toward the
subscription for a floral piece, and during
the funeral kept his place on his car.
De Cascia saw himself in effigy when he
took his car out this morning, but did not
comment upon it. Later in the day the
flsure was taken down and he was re

Slayer of Dr. Jessup WiU
Not Fight Against Going

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. Oct. 16.
Preliminary to his trial for Insanity,
which will begin to-morrow morning In
Judge Melvin's ' court, Charles' G.
Adams, the acquitted slayer of Dr. John
G. Jessup, was submitted to an examina
tion by alienists in the County Jail this
morning. Drs. Hatch and Rowell, who
offered testimony at Adams' trial for
murder, -and Dr. Lustig of San Francisco
were the examining physicians. They
would not make public their conclusions,
as they will be called as witnesses at the
insanity trial, and did not deem it proper
to speak of the matter at this time, but it
is understood that they will recommend
that Adams be committed to some safe
retreat until he fully recovers his mental
and physical health, which Is now im
paired as the result of long Indulgence in
intoxicating liquors.
Besides., the testimony of the alienists
the State will call upon several witnesses
who testified at the murder trial to tell
their stories over again at the insanity
trial. Principal among these, of course,
vrill be Miss Agnes S. Adams, who re
counted at the trial ail of her father's
eccentricities from 1SS8, when he first
begran to drink to excess, down to the
very day and hour of the murder. A num
ber of Berkeley people who had an oppor
tunity to note Adams' wild actions will
also be called upon to testify.
Adams himself does not think he is
now insane, but says he will not offer any
opposition to the proposition to send him
to an asylum, as he realizes that It is for
bis best interests.
"I must have been Insane at the time
of the shooting of my friend. Dr. Jessup,"
he says, "but 1 think I'm all right now.
I aa suffering from a nervous affection,
but it will pass away after I have treat
ment. I do not object to going to some
place where I will get good treatment and
>e brought back to health."
Adams pays he did not ask for the re
turn of the pistol with which he shot Dr.
Jessup, which it was stated he did, but
that it was made by relatives.

Joseph Earl McGovern, lti years old and
who resided at 100S Franklin street, was
struck and Instantly killed this afternoon
at Shell Mound station by an outbound
San Ramon local train. The accident oc
curred almost within sight of the boy's
father, J. J. McGovern, a carpenter em
ployed by the Southern Pacific Company,
who was working near the scene.
Young McGovern had left his home an
hour or two before his death to ride out
to where his father was working. Before
he reached Shell Mound a tire of his
bicycle was punctured. It was this trifling
accident which led to the lad's tragic end.
Unable to mend his wheel, that he could
make the return trip on it, the youth de
cided to take the train home. Leaving his
lather he walked over to the Berkeley
train, and while dragging his bicycle over
to the baggage car the northbound San
Ramon train boomed along the track.
Young McGovern did not observe the ap
proaching train in time to save himself.
lie was struck by the pilot of the loco
motive, his skull being crushed on the
right side and his right leg being frac
tured.
The accident occurred at 4:30 o'clock.
Shortly afterward the father learned of
it, and going to the scene found the dead
body of his bov, who had left him only a
few minutes before. The shock was so
( great that the grief stricken parent col
'lapsed. As soon as it was ascertained
that the lad was dead the Coroner was
notified and the body was removed to the
Morgue. Young McGovern was formerly
a messenger employed by the Associated
Press in San Francisco. He was prepar
ing to go to work in the roundhouse at
the West Oakland railroad yards within
a few days. *

late Dr. J. H. Wythe. held this afternoon
from the First Methodist Church, \u25a0was

sociates of the deceased physician in his
lifetime work an a man of religious and
of scientific pursuits. The services were
simple, yet many voices were raided in
eulogy of the distinguished scientist's
life, his works and his noble character.
The exercises were opened by a scripture
lesson, read by the Rev. John Coyle, pre
siding -elder of the Methodist Church.
Prayer was offered by the Rev. J. W.

Far Failed.
OAKLAND. Oct. 18.â The efforts to ad
just the differences in the Building Trades
Council of Alameda County seem almost
hopeless. The struggle between the fac
tions Leaded by J. H. Mullen and D. A.
Shannon is still unsettled. An effort to
hold a meeting of the council as It was
recently revised has failed, for the Shan
non men remained away. They represent
the carpenters, millmen, painters and
longshoremen, â¢while the Mullen fol
lowers represent the various stone
trades, electricaJ men, lathers and
others. The Shannon men say that
tr.ey represent the largest number of
union men numerically, but owing to
the system of representation they have
the smallest number of delegates, and so
tfcey refu?e to attend. Mullen recently
secured control of the council and was
elected business agent against Shannon,
who a few months before had defeated
Mullen. Mullen has the backing of the
San Francisco Building Trades. This or
ganization tried at one time to harmonize
matters, but was unable to accomplish
enything.

OAKLAND. Oct 16.-Plans of ornate
classic denlgn, from the hands of Coxhead
& Coxhead, architects, have been adopted
by the board of free library trustees for
the decoration of the children's room in
the new public library building, which
work is to be- done under the direction
of the Ebell Society. The scheme of dec
oration is ouite elaborate, yet ample al
lowance is made for the needs of the
apartment, \u25a0which is to be reserved for
the exclusive use of the youth who are
patrons of the library.
The floor space allotted to this depart
ment approximates 2000 square feet, the
room being rectangular. The chief feature
of the interior finish is" a series of classic
pillaring providing a basis for the exten
sion book stacks where 6200 volumes will
be accommodated. On,the east and 'west
sides of the room will be niches for statu
ary, the rear wall being left blank for
such mural decoration as may be desired.
A. frieze of conventional design will re
lieve the upper wall space and there .will
also be decorative work about the' six
alcoves and settles which have been ar
ranged on the east and west sides of the
room. The window space has been left
clear that ample natural light be had
during the daytime.
Architect E. Coxhead in submitting his
plans of decoration explained that the
general scheme would be worked out in
stucco, with light tints for coloring. The
floor will be laid iri polished oak, with
cedar book racks. The estimated cost of
the work, exclusive of movable furniture,
is $5000.
Formal application has been made to
the trustees by the library committee of
the Ebell Society for permission to furnish
the children's room, without cost to the
city, upon the plans which have been
adopted by the board. The trustees have
given their formal consent that this shall
bo done. The legal side of the matter has
been referred to the City Attorney for
an opinion upon the point whether the
trustees can lawfully delegate the priv
ilege to the ladies of the society.
There is nothing more to be done toward
the completion of the library building ex
cept to install the furnishings and light
fixtures. Plans for this work have been
submitted to the trustees and they have
ordered preliminary estimates and bids.
The cost will be in the neighborhood of
$S500. The trustees are hopeful that they
will be able to surmount the financial dif
ficulties that confront them and have the
new library structure complete and ready
for service before many months have
passed.
It is expected that the Ebell Society will
very shortly take the final action neces
sary to raise the money required to com
plete the children's department.
THERE have been leaders of or
chestras and bands before that
have attracted the attention of
the public by their idiosyncrasies,
but to see a real creator of nov
elties the music loving public should pay
a visit to the Alhambra Theater, with a
particular eye to the delsarte gymnastics
of Giuseppe Creatore, the director of the
Royal Italian. Band.
Sousa has his littje ways, but he Is not
in it with Signor Creatore.'
Now the music of the Royal Italian
Band is wonderful in the way of har
monies, but Creatore's conducting is the
star attraction of the band.
Signor Creatore, who greatly resembles
Attorney Herbert Choynskl, does all his
leading with a very self-satisfied air, and
with movements of head and arms that
lead his audience to suppose he is about
to startle it by a plunge into the depths
of the seaâ one of those plunges that can
only be seen in a theater presenting most
lurid melodrama.
Signor CreatorÂ© made no fatal dives
last night, though. He charmed his au
dience with his hypnotic, left-handed
warnings to one of his trombone players
which carried a "go way back and sit
down" air with it. The trombone player
obeyed as if he were a great believer in
telepathy.
The great band then went on and played
several selections that won the applause
of the people present, but Sigiior Creatoro
was not to be suppressed.
The director was always part of the
show. During the tremolo stage of the
music he wafted his baton as if he was
counting time on Joe Walcott when that
dusky tighter fell from the solar plexus
blow of "Kid" Carter, but the staccato
made nim stir his long locks of hair, do
a few side steps and look ominously upon
his players. He appeared to be a very
mild man when the pianissimo effect was
called for, but the fortissimoâ the public
should see it.
Creatoro is a wonder as a leader, and
he has an excellent lot of musicians at
command.
He and his men will be a big feature of
the monster benefit this afternoon at the
Grand Opera-house, and the town will
have a free show of the best when the
band parades at noon from the Alhambra
to the opera-house.
"Ernani" and "Cavalleria" and "I Pag
liacci" have met with the usual success at
the Tivoli. The week led on! with Verdi
night, which brought out a packed house,
and all the business has been well up to
the mark first set.
"Ernani" is given with a strong cast,
and all participating have pleased the
audiences. Dado and Barbareschi are ex
ceptionally well placed. Montanari is
singing Santuzza this week and is once
more in good voice. Agostini is as
forceful as ever In the role of Turiddu
Russo is Canio In "I Pagliacci" and sings
PASSENGERS SUSTAIN
INJTTRY IN COLLISION
Cable and Electric Street Cars Come
Together With Disastrous
Effect.
. Several persons were injured last even
ing in a collision about 7 o'clock between
an electric an<i a cable car at the inter
section of Eighteenth and Castro streets.
The Castro-street car was crowded with
pasengers, and three of them were pretty
badly shaken up. Two of them, Miss
Bertha Dornbach. of 707 Diamond street,
and a Miss Kelly were thrown from the
rear platform. Miss Dornbach sustained
a sprained ankle, and Miss Kelly was
rendered unconscious from the shock. An
unknown passer ger, who was also on the
rear platform of the cable car, was
bruised about the head.
The Castro-street car was thrown from
the track and badly damaged and most
of the windows of the Eighteenth-street
car were wrecked.
Meads' Besignation Held Out.
OAKLAND. Oct. 16.â The actual resig
nation of S. P. Meads, the vice principal
of the Oakland High School, was never
made public. It has now become known
that Mr. Meads sent a rather tart letter
to the Board of Education, setting forth
his reasons for resigning and criticizing
the policy of reducing salaries In the High
School. This resignation reached School
Superintendent McClymonds. who asked
Mr. M^ads to allow him to retain the
document and put merely a formal resig
nation before the board. This was finally
done, and so the reasons for Mr. Meads'
resignation were never made public. The
reduction of salaries was the main, rea
ton, but the original letter contained some
general references to this reduction as ap
plied to others besides himself.
POLICEMAN PREVENTS A
DOMESTIC TRAGEDY
Former Army Officer Is Stopped in
the Act of Braining His
Wife.
OAKLAND, Oct. 16.â The opportune ar
rival of Policeman William Quigiey' to
day at the Windsor Hotel prevented Cul
lom Calhoun Mitchell, a former lieuten
ant In the Fortieth Infantry, U. S. V.,
from braining his wife with a silver water
pitcher. The patrolman burst into the
rcom Just as the ex-soldier had uplifted
the heavy vessel and was about to smash
It upon Mrs. Mitchell's head. Quigiey ran
in and knocked the pitcher out of the
enraged husband's hand, subduing that
worthy's attempt to continue the encoun
ter.
Mitchell was sent to the City Prison to
cool off. He had been drinking heavily.
Yesterday, his wife says, he kept a loaded
pistol at her head for hours. Twice she
called upon the police, but she escaped
from the apartments before they ap
peared.
To drink Mrs. Mitchell attributes her
husband's outbreak. They were wedded
here two years ago after a romantic at
tachment formed in Mississippi, when she
was the wife of another man. Being di
vorced, she followed Mitchell to Califor
nia while he was en route to the Philip
pines. After Mitchell's discharge from the
army the troubles began. Although he is
a member of a prominent family of Jack
son, Miss., and his wife was a belle of
Kentucky, the ex-army officer dropped
from his poclal position and became, ac
cording to his wife, brutal and insanely
violent from liquor.
Mrs. Mitchell announced' that she would
return to Kentucky, but she refused to
swear to a complaint against her hus
band.

OAKLAND. Oct. 16.â Attorney Geary,

of her husbana s money in costs and the

The trial will continue Â«bout fifteen days
more.

The business of trie Grand Chapter of
the Eastern Star was dispatched yester
day under tho direction of Grand Patron
Conant in a manner that astonished
many of those who attended previous
sessions of the grand body. There was an
unusual amount of business disposed of
without loss of time. The several com
mittees reported on the reports of grand
officers submitted to them, and these
were * all concurred In, including: the
recommendations of the grand patron
that members must sign the constitution
within sixty days after initiation and that
members of the order who desire to affili
ate with a chapter must do so within
sixty days. "What were heretofore known
as contributing members will no longer
be a feature of the order.
Several minor changes in the constitu
tion were adopted.
Charters were granted to the ten chap
ters instituted last year, it appearing that
all were up to the qualifications required.
Among these, a list of which was pub
lished yesterday, is San Francisco Chap
ter, which was instituted one month ago
yesterday. . â¢
To-night the members of the Grand
Chapter will visit Oakland to witness the
exemplification of the work by the officers
of Unity Chapter.
This afternoon the election for grand
officers will take place. The principal
candidates for grrand patron are M.
Joseph Savage, past patron of Harmony
Chapter of this city, who has proved him
self a most enthusiastic- member of the
order; C. L.. Byce of Petaluma. who is
also . well known, and J. Mitchell of Log
Angeles. It. is possible that others may
be voted for, as there are not any nomi
nations before election.
Charters Are Granted to Ten Hew
Chapters Instituted During the
Last Year.

Two years at hard labor in the Stato
Prison at San Quentin was the sentence
pronounced yesterday by United States
District Judge de Haven on "Walter N.
Dimmick, ex-chief clerk In the Mint. This
was for his conviction on the charge of
having presented to Cashier Cole a false,
fraudulent and fictitious voucher for
$498 37, and for having applied the money
to a purpose not contemplated or allowed
by law.
George I>. Collins, the prisoner's coun
sel, made a â¢ lengthy argument on " his
motion for a new trial. The motion was
denied, and a motion for arrest of judg
ment met with the same fate. Collins
took exceptions and was allowed ten day3
in which to file a bill of exceptions pre
paratory to appealing the case to the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
A stay of judgment for one day was
granted in order to allow .the prisoner to
arrange his afl*air3 before starting for his
country residence near San Rafael.
On motion of United States District At
torney Woodworth November 7 was set
as the date for the trial of Dimmick upon
the indictment charging him with having
embezzled moneys of the United States
In several small amounts, aggregat
ing $1386. All these sums were subse
quently repaid by Dimmick, the alleged
embezzlement having been but tempo
rary. The trial on the indictment charg
ing Dimmick with the larceny of $30,OCO
will take place at a later date, to be set
hereafter.
Two Other Indictments for Embezzle
ment and Larceny Yet Remain

WILLEMSTAD, Island of Curacao, Oct.
16.â Advices received here from Mara
caibo, Venezuela, under date of yester
day, say that the "Venezuelan troops on
the Guajira peninsula are In a condition
of utter confusion. Robberies and out
rages by Indians continue. The entire
Indian population is against the Venezue
lans and the latter dare not leave their
camps. The Indians are ambushing and
killing Email parties. Demoralization is
spreading among the Venezuelan troops
and there Is increasing: sickness among
them. Four deserters from the Venezue
lan ranks were recently caught and shot.
The Venezuelans at Cuajira are In no
condition to assume the aggressive
against Colombia, hence there is little
likelihood of fighting.
The Tachira frontier is still quiet, rains
In the mountains preventing active opera
tions, if any were contemplated.
Few troops are being moved toward
Quajira and Tachira. Venezuela, for the
present, is maintaining the status quo on.

a programme of fourteen other up-to-date

He replied that he supposed I would at least . endorse
what he had heard, and that I would offer r.o objection to its
publication. I warned him again, but he went of f, with- the
remark that it was "too good a story to keep, out. " â¢
The above are the facts. In addition. I wish ' : to state I
do not know that Mr : De Young has ever had as much as a. per
sonal conference with the members of the Committee, and I
know that he never requested places for an/ of his friends
or relatives.. I make this 'denial hot only in justice to Mr.
De Young, but in justice to myself . The entire article printed
in this morning's Examiner was a contemptible falsehood,
possibly founded upon rumor, but certainly not found-d upon
anything I have ever said to any one.
By giving this denial space in your paper, I shall be
very greatly obliged.
Yours sincerely,
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: I was both, humiliated and as
tonished at the wantonly exaggerative statement imputed to me
in this morning's Examiner concerning Mr. De Young and the local
political situation. .
From "A to Z" the alleged interview is 'a malicious dis
tortion. I never stated that Mr. De Young wished to have his
relatives placed in comfortable positions in the City - Hall ,
and that because forsooth his wishes Were not acceded to he
was disappointed and at daggers' points with the managers of
the campaign. Nor did I to any one, much less a represen
tative of the Examiner, say that Mr. De , Young controlled or
exercised any measure of influence with the editor of The Call .
It is true that a young man called at my rooms on Tuesday
evening with a printed proof of an alleged interview with me,
but*it is not true that I either gave my consent to its pub
lication or expressed satisfaction with its correctness.. On
the contrary, I informed the yourig man that the whole * 'yarn' '
must have emanated from the imaginative minds employed on the

ize its publication. He answered that his City Editor was
bent upon publishing it, and that he would not be able -to
prevent it from appearing., "Then," said I, "if it appears
in your columns, -I shall promptly and severely deny every
syllable imputed to me:" I then asked him where he had ob
tained his information, and he said that it was "common rumor. "
"Then," said I, "do you propose ventilating common
rumor and fixing the responsibility upon me?"
San Francisco, Oct. 16, 1901.
UGLY tales are told In the camp
' of the bosses and boodlers to the
. effect that some expert manipu
lator has swiped or misapplied
$10,000 belonging to a campaign
fund of $30,000. Of the aggregate sum of
$30,000 contributed by sympathetic ; cor
porations to swing the primary election
for the boss ticket the sum of $20,000 ia
accounted for In a rough estimate of dis
bursements. Old stagers in the boss ranks,
assert that no such large sum as $30,000
was raised to down the Primary League,
but experts who observed the contest con
tend tha.t a very large sum was disbursed
on the day of election. In the Twenty
eighth, \u25a0 Thirty-ninth and Forty-fourth
districts coin was lavishly circulated.
The ctory goes that a manipulator who
has gained .\u25a0 some notoriety for skill in
rounding up Supervisors to .fix the, right
kind of water rates and who displays
some dexterity In handling the railroad
commission aiid State Board of Equaliza
tion went to the corporations tha-t furnish
Illumination, power and transportation
and suggested that a fund be raised to
procure immunity from unfriendly legis
lation In the Board of Supervisors. It
was represented that no other contribu
tion would be required for two years. It
is believed that the money was raised on
the assurance that the political collector
â¢would not come again after the Super
visors were elected.
Money Used at the Primary.
Diligent inquiry discloses tbe fact that
$500 was allotted to each Assembly dis
trict manager and $2500 to the County
Committee. Details of. the disbursement
in this respect are not clear, but it is
supposed that the County Committee got
its share of the boodle from a lump sum
of $13,000 assigned to John Lynch and
Jere Burke. The sum of $3000 represented
in the allotment of $500 to each Assembly
district was distributed by various per
sons.
Sana Rainey received a hint that Crim
mins got an envelope containing $5000.
The Call's information, derived from a
source supposed to be authentic, is to the
effect that the Crimmins envelope con
tained $7000. The story is that Martin
Kelly asked Crimmins what the envelope
contained and the latter replied $5000.
Crimmins suggested that he .would keep
5500 give $500 to Kelly and assign the re
mainderâ$4000âto the Assembly districts.
Gossip goes in the camp that Crimmins
held out from Kelly $2000 of the amount
allotted to the pair. The inference is
etrong that Lynch and Burke took care
of some of the district fishts.
Ten Thousand Dollars Missing. \u25a0
It 5s reasora'ble to infer that Crimmins
and Kelly, used $1000 in the districts. It
seems probable that the $&>&0 given to the
County Committee was cart of the allow
ance to Lynch and Burke.
The mystery of the transaction is what
became of the remaining $10,000. It m:iy
turn out that the* County Committee got
its $2503 direct from the chief disburser,
but admitting that to be the truth tiv;
sum of $7500 is still unaccounted for.
The allotment, according to gossip of
the insiders, was $7000 to Kelly and Crim
mins and J13.C00 to Lynch and Burke,
leaving $10,000 unaccounted for. The ward
gruys may have $10,000 in reserve to cov.t
contingencies. Once in a while men who
are bought conduct themselves in such
manner toward the buyers as to merit
l he reproach of dishonesty. Tom Scott,
HunlingtoiVs famous adversary in the
lobby at Washington, deiined the truly
honest man "as the fellow who stays
bought." The chief local manipulator of
corrupt local political deals may be hold
ing back $10,005 to meet emergencies of
dishonesty.
It is common talk that candidates other
than those on the Supervisorial ticket
may require assistance. For example,
ex- Assembly man A. G. Fisk, the Exam
iner's candidate for District Attorney,
may need help. The Examiner, compre
hending that its open advocacy of his
cause would bring to him nothing but
disaster, has little to say in his favor.
Vacancies on Ticket Filled.
It took the "old" Republican County
Committee but a very few moments last
night to fill thc vacancies caused by the
withdrawal cf A. F. Roberts and Adam
Andrews a? candidates for Supervisor.
Augustus Tiiden called the committee to
order aiid -explained the" objects of the
meeting- Alpheus Duffy named Joseph
S. Xyland.. who he said represented the ,
laboring element of" the Thirty-sixth As-
Bembly District, with its 5000 Republican
voters. The nomination of Nyland was
seconded by Pat Prenderjrast. *
Thomas D.Riordan supplemented ihe
motion with an amendment that 'Nyland's
name be substituted for that of A. F.
Roberts, and then proceeded to name
Pred J. McWllliamp to fill the vacancy
caused by the withdrawal of Adam An
drew. ' Several coir.mitteemen seconded
the nomination, and the secretary cast
tfie ballot for both candidates in accord
ance with the provisions of the law.
The certificates of the requisite com
mittees were tiled later with the Repria
trar of Voters, thus completing the tickot.
Joseph S. Nyland is a cooper by trade,
end is foreman of the cooperage firn; of
Herbert' & Vogel. He resides at 21 Pros

Frederick J. McTVIUiams is -the presi
dent of the Siebe Shoe Company and re
eides at 2119 Pacific avenue. He is con
nected with one of the branches of the
Siebe family, and is said by his friends
to be a young man of sterling worth.
John F. "Wilson, alias M. H. Allen, alias
Beringer.alias Stanton, appeared yesterday
'before United States Court Commissioner
Heacock for examination on the charge
of having used the mails for the purpose
of defrauding. Before the examination
dad got well under way counsel for the
r Â£ n ii nt a ?reed to make no opposition
to J^ilson bein=r taken to Omaha for trial
in the State Court, on the indictment for
iorgery. The prosecution thereupon with-'
drew the charge of using the mails un
lawfully and the prisoner started on his
eastward journey last night in custody of

sas City.
Wilson. Taken Back for Trial.
Franklin K. Lane was the last speaker.
After expressing his . view-on the Repub
lican ticket, which were*not compliment
ary, and giving a recital of his experience*
in offices, he entertained the audience
with a number of interesting stories.
There is a plan on foot to steal the Geary
street franchise from the city. The Republican
candidates have pledged themselves, I believe,
to place it back in the hands of the people
who now have it. What we want to do is tr.
take the road, .turn it into an underground
electrical system and operate it for the bene
fit of the city.
The entire Republican ticket, particular
ly the Supervisorial portion, received the
general condemnation of all speakers.
They spoke of it as . being base born,
hatched in dishonesty and "spewed out
by a corrupt corporation." Dwyer an
nounced that the party favored the
municipal ownership and operation of the
Geary-street road and Joseph Tobin, who
followed, voiced his sentiments.
The nominee for Mayor declared himself
in favor of honesty in government and
praised the work of the present admin
istration. He was frequently interrupted
with applause. He said in part:
Municipal government' must be clean and
must be kept clean. I am no demagogic and
anti-corporation howler. it Is the plain old
issue of good citizenship against bad citizen
ship. "Why, then, have the corporations injected
themselves into this campaign. I say now the
men who love their city and have their money
invested consider these things. If you want
fair and Just treatment you can get it and
it won't cost you a cent.
We. have now reached a crisis in the politi
cal history of San Francisco. Materially we
are well off, but politically this is the hour
or trial. Are we goins to turn over the City
Hall to the old gang? Do you want to go to
the City Hall behind a stable or in the rear
of - a saloon ? â¢
Want to Take thc Geary-Street Road.
Favor STunicir>al Ownership.
I say tnat the Labor party does not officially
represent the unions of. San Francisco. Every
one . will agree that It is more the . work of
Individuals than that of organized labor. Many
of your leaders have said onenly that tht
election of a ticket of unions, only is the
quickest way to disrupt the unions. No ticket
that represents but one class is fit to be
elected. .
J. J. Dwyer acted as thÂ© chairman of
the .'meeting. In referring to the Union
Labor party he, said: I
Joseph S. Tobin, and his asso
ciates upon the ticket. All factions of the
Democratic party were represented on the
platform, and as' the younger and older
workers in the party ranks were recog
nized they were greete/i with cheecs.
"While Mr. Tobin was the principal speak
er, a number of other candidates ad
dressed the meetinc
District*Attorney Bylngton, Supervisors
H. U. Brandenstein, A. Comte Jr. and
