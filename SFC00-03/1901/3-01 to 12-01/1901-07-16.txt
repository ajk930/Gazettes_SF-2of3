:. KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 15.â A letter
received here from a prominent merchant
in Cartagena, Colombia, reports a serious
outbreak among the Colombian troops In
the outskirts of that city last week.
The soldiers were dissatisfied and
threatened to desert. Monday they at
tempted to break out from their barracks
and attacked their guards. A bitter fight
followed, In which seven of the guards
were killed and several wounded on both
sides. This letter further says a large
number of mutineers have escaped and
it is expected they will rejoin the rebels
and that the indications are that the
revolution will continue longer and with
renewed energy on. the part of the pres
ent Liberals.

HEREFORD. Tex., . July 15.â Word
reached this place to-day of a regular
pitched battle and wholesale killing be
tween Mexicans and negroes who are
working on the new Rock Island exten
sion In New Mexico, one hundred miles
west ofÂ»here. The trouble originated In
the killing of a Mexican by a negro some
weeks since. The authorities undertook
to arrest the assailant, but his friends in
terfered and they were obliged to with
draw. Last week some thirty-five : or
forty Mexicans armed themselves with
Winchesters and went after the negro. A
battle took place, in which fifteen negroes
were killed outright and Beveral wounded.
The casualties among the Mexicans can
not be learned. The trouble occurred at
Spencer's railroad camp, near Liberty, N.
Mex.. in a sparsely settled portion of the
Territory, where the peace officers .are
few and the law is not rigidly enforced.

In 1S98, when the case was before the

for the pardon of their client. Gray was
tried for the crime and acquitted.

All the men of the royal family of Eng

ha- 2 held high rank in that order. The
latt jueen was a friendly patron of the
era:! and during her last jubilee gave a
special audience to representatives of the
Masonic order, at which Lord Amherst
addressed her as "the daughter of a
Freemason, .the mother of Freemasons
and the patron and benefactress- of our
order." For twenty-seven years King Ed

Two French gunboats and one Japanese
war vessel at qnce repaired to the island.
The island, though quite large and oc
cupying a most commanding position,
possesses no harbors or places of Â¦ safe
anchorage. This fact probably accounts
for its long immunity from foreign ag
gression.
It will be difficult, if not impossible, for
the Korean Government, to put down the
rebellion ; without foreign assistance. It
is not improbable that, the Incident may
lead to foreign intervention. S As Japan
and Russia have engaged to refrain from
interference in the internal affairs of
Korea, it is apparent that the trouble Of
the island of Quelpart may become a
serious source of international contro
versy. .
Allen quotes Captain Mornay of .the
French grunboat Surprise, which returned
early in June from â¢ Quelpart. Captain
Mornay found the two French . priests
whom he went to succor besieged in tne
chief town of the island. The captain
estimated the number of those killed in
various conflicts at 600. The Korean
Government sent 200 soldiers to the isl
and, who arrived there on the lirst of
June. The difficulty was found to be so
serious that reinforcements' were desired
and a\ further detachment was sent a
week later. Local newspapers place the
blame of the insurrection upon Yo Yong
Ik, because of his having sent one of his
men to the island as an official for the
collection of increased taxes.
The French Minister. M. de Plancy, is
quoted as 6aylng that a number of Catho T
lie Christians were employed by officials
in collecting these taxes, which seemed
to have been entirely out of proportion
to the ability of the natives to pay, and it
is this employment of native Christians
which brought about the general perse
cution of their brethren. It is reported
that 150 of the native Christians were
killed. *

Mullahy cf the Stationary Firemen's Associa
tions of Pennsylvania, has given up all hope
of an amicable settleniyit of the strike o/ the
firemen, ordered to begin to-morrow. It is ex
pected that 600 firemen in tne Wyoming region
vill refuse to go to work to-morrow. Most of
these m*.n are employed at the mines and un
lf-ss new men can be secured to take their
places, many of the collieries will be obliged
to suspend operations.
NEW YORK. July IS.â Xone of the Eteel

McKEESPORT. Pa.â There was no excite
nient in McKeerport to-day on account of the
strike. The Dewees-Wood and ' the United
States Tin plants are idle and no attempt was
made to resume work at either plant during
the day. The men are looking for an early
ttttlement.
JOHNSTOWN, Pa.â It developed to-day that
considerably more than half of the 12,000 em
ployes of the Cambria Steel Company In this
city are members of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation. The Cambria mills are non-union and
it was believed until to-day that they would
r.ot be affected by the strike. Prominent steel
workers here say. however, that if President
Khaffer calls on the men here to go out the
cptire plant of the Cambria Con-pany will be
tied tip.
SCOTTDALE. Pa.â All departments of the
Scottdale and Old Meadow rolling- mill at this
glaoe are running- full to-day. The officials
ore have little fear that the personal agree
ment entered into by the men will be broken.
CARNEGIE, Pa.â No attempt was made to
start work at the Chartier Steel Works in Car
negie to-day, as the mill is well organized,
about 200 of the employes belonging: to the
Amalgamated Association.
NEW PHILADELPHIA, Ohlo-350 employes
cf the New Philadelphia rolling mill are idle.
Following are extracts of reports from
near-by towns up to 8 p. m.:
Reports From Near-By Towns.
"When President Shaffer was informed
of the granting of the advance to the Mc-
Keesport tube workers, he said:
"I anticipated such action on" the part
of the manufacturers and have warned"
our men to guard against being blinded
by such dust-throwing methods. The tube
men in McKeesport are unorganized, and
this advance coming with the beginning
of the strike of the employes of the three
companies Â¦with which we are at Issue is
an indication that the steel corporation
appreciates the strength of the Amalga
mated Association and is trying to thwart
its growth and alms by such means as
have been adopted in McKeesport. I ex
pect that similar advances will be given
to the men in other works of the United
States Steel Corporation that have not
been affected by the strike order, in the
hope that the workers may refuse to come
out should we decide to extend the strike
to all the plants of the corporation."
At the district offices of the American
Sheet Steel Company a meeting of man
agers was held to-day. It was a closely
guarded meeting and information was
hard to secure. It was said, however,
that the men In the Old Meadow mill in
Scottsdale would not strike. The Scotts
dale iron and steel mill Is also working
and no signs of a strike are visible there.
The alleged attempt on the part of the
association to attack the forces of the big
Vandergrift mills in Vandergrift, Pa.,
vrere not regarded seriously, though the
company is watching closely all , such
movements.
Meeting of the Managers.
The most interesting" report to the
Amalgamated Association to-day was the
dispatch from New York which said that
a conference of the manufacturers was to
be held in New York to-morrow, at which
Warner Armes, vice president of the
American Tin Plate Company, was to pre
sent a detailed account of the experiences
of the committee that met the Amalga
mated Association in this city last week.
It was stated that. the question of again
exending the olive branch to the strikers
or of taking up the fight and crushing
the association would 4>e determined.
Generally speaking, the workers, from
President "Shaffer down, seem to be look
ing for some sort of settlement.
The general offices of the American Steel
Hoop Company are in this city, but it was
statea there to-day that President W. E.
Corey, Â»who is also executive head of the
National Steel Company, had nothing to
say concerning the plans of the companies
in* meeting the difficulties of the strike,
nor ss to what condition the mills were
in where non-union men had joined the
forces of the strikers. The policy of the
manufacturers, it was said, is to remain
quiet for the time and await developments.
The officials of the American Tin Plate
Company are all in New York.
Conference of Manufacturers.
The American Steel Hoop Company s
supposedly non-union mill, known as the
Painter mill, was closed this morning in
all its branches. The tie-up at this mill
was said to have been a surprise to the
mill owners and officials in charge of.it
The plant known as the Lindsey & Mc-
Cutcheon mill, in Allegheny, was shut
down completely In the puddling and
mills. All the skilled workmen refused to
enter the mill this morning and the com
pany did not even operate the five fur
na ces.
The finishing department of the mill was
Â¦working during t)ie day. as the men are
jiot in the union, but it is claimed by the
workers that the employes in that depart
ment will not go to work in the morning.
The American Steel Hoop Company s mill
at ilor.esscn was not closed to-day. It
haÂ» been non-union since it was built two
vcars ago. and the company says the men
will remain loyal. The Amalgamated peo
ple Â«rol not discuss the situation in that
rail! at present.
While all the mills of the United States
Stcrl Corporation are included in the gen
eral t!e-up. the three companies are the
lirfct attacked. What the next move will
be the workers do not say. It is an
nounced to-night that the circular letter
which was expected to be sent out to
day c?l!ins on the men in the mills of
the Federal Steel Company, the National
Steel Company and the National Tube
Company to come out, will not be Issued
at present. *
Non-TTnion Mill Is Closed.
PITTSBUUG. July 13.â Reports received
from all sources connected with the strike
of the steel workers to-day Indicate that
the members of the Amalgamated Asso
cietjon have matters well In hand and
that the strike order was generally
obeyed. Telegrams from various points
"where the mills of the American Tin
Plate Company, the American Steel Hoop
Company and the American Sheet Steel
Company are located tell of the shutting
dewn of these plants in large numbers. In
jnany cases the plants had been shut
down by the first strike order, which af
fected the sheet steel and the steel hoop
companies only. The last order brought
out all union plants of the American Tin
Plate Company, with the single exception
of the new mill in Monessen, which is Still
running. At the Amalgamated Associa
tion headquarters It Is stated that the
figures given out Saturday night regard
ing the number of men who would be ac
tually idle In the mills of the three com
panies have proved correct. This number
Â¦\ras placed at 74,000. >-
Of the 74,000 men idle, 2500 are In Pltts-
Irars, 800 in Allegheny and 1500 in Mc
vKeerpcrt. President Shaffer has it in his
povrer to close many more Pittsburg mills,
but it is not thought that he will do any
thing of a radical nature until he is com
pelled to.

ASTORIA, July 15.â Extensive prepara
tions are being. made for this year's re
gatta, and .the eighth annual carnival
promises to be the most successful ever
held here. At the present time the
finance committee is interviewing the
merchants of the city and subscriptions
are coming In rapidly. Â¦Â¦
: Particular interest attaches to this
year's carnival because of the fact that
the queen -will be -elected in Portland.
Heretofore her majesty has always been
an Astoria girl, but, as ,Fortland people
have taken a lively interest in the car
nival, assisting it in every possible man
ner, the committee felt that the queen
should-be selected in that city this year
as a mark of appreciation. Voting for the
candidates has already commenced and
will continue- until about August 10 or 15.
The candidates are society ,* leaders and
their friends here and in -Portland are
working hard. The queen, her,, maids and
retinue and other dignitaries, ., Including
Governor Geer and his staffs will come
down from Portland on a special boat.'
The dates of the carnival have been
changed to August 29, 30 and 31. -Usually
the- regatta has been held. August 15, 16
and 17. but as those dates would conflict
with Elks' day at the Tacoma fair, the
change was made by the committee.
Arrangements for the participation of
the coast . oarsmen are now being made.
Secretary McCue is in San Francisco con
sulting with Bay City: rowers, to whose
efforts the success of past regattas has
Leen due in great measure. The British
Columbia oarsmen are getting crews to
gether and there will also be several crews
from ! Portland. Handsome prizes are to
be offered for all the events, and the win
ners of -this .year's contests will carry
away trophies worth keeping.

WASHINGTON. July lo.-The last mall
from the East has brought a detailed
newspaper account of the shooting affray
at Peking which has resulted in. a Ger
man claim against the United States. The
account, which â¢ appears In a Japanese
newspaper, states -that an American sen
try had been posted at the western ex
tremity of Legation street, close to where
the new American legation Is building.
That portion of Legation street was being
newly macadamized and rolled. A bar
ricade, had been put up. and Major Rob
ertson had posted a sentry on the spot to
warn people not to ride over the newly
made road, pedestrians only being al
lowed to ' traverse it. -A German officer
came riding along, knocked down both the
sentry and the barricade and galloped
across the forbidden route. The sentry
scrambled to his feet and sent a shot aft
er the officer, but missed, and the bullet
lodged in the lee of a German sentry
standing cw duty half way down the
street. The newspaper states that the
American was sentenced to one month's
imprisonment and fined a month's pay,
"presumably for hitting the wrong man."

WASHINGTON, July 15.â It Is now ap

reached the State Department from
China that it was solely through the mod
era tion and humanity exercised by the
United States representatives at Peklngr
by the President's direction in the early
negotiations for a settlement of the Boxer
â¢trouble that a number of innocent lives
were not sacrificed. These reports show
that a- more sober and . painstaking in
quiry, has developed the fact that some
of the . Chinese officials supposed to have
been connected with the Boxer outrages,
whose capital punishment was demanded
by , the . foreign .; Ministers, have been
proved to be entirely. ,. innocent of the
charges made ~ against them. Â¦Â¦ In many
other cases proof , has been adduced that
the offenses with which the Chinese ofn*
ci&ls ! were charged Â¦' were not nearly â¢ so
grave as 'was supposed at first by the for
eign representatives in Peking. There
fore, It is regarded here' by officials as a
matter for congratulation that Messrs.
Conger and Rockhlll moved with deliberar
tion_and acted as a .restraining influence
in the matter of punishment, for not only
these lives were saved but under their
influence the whole list of capital sen
tences was reduced from ten to four, and
mitigation of other offenses was obtained.

Head Consul R. F. Wells of the Woodmen
of the World on the 10th inst. It is the
first organization of a secret character
that has been established in that new
and flourishing papermill town.
Golden Gate Camp at its meeting July

out of town enjoying their summer vaca
tion and they will be inducted into the
mysteries of the order on the next initia

officers of this camp in Native Sons' Hall
July 12 was witnessed by a very
large number of ladies and gentle
men, who had presented to them In addi
tion to the impressive ceremony of placing
the officers in their stations an excellent
programme of entertainment and then a
programme of dancing. It proved to be
one of the most enjoyable affairs of the
kind ever given by the camp.
The public installation of officers of
California Camp in the Assembly Hall of
the Pioneers' building- was attended July
9 by an audience of Neighbors of
Woodcraft and lady relatives and friends
that crowded the beautifully decorated
hall to its limit. American flacs, the
colors of the order and the motto of the
camp in golden poppies, were features of
the decorations. The officers .were in
stalled with all the pomp and ceremony of
the organization and there was in addi

BRYAN REPLIES
TO OHIO CRITICS
Says Democrats Cannot
. Dodge. the Money
Question.
Mr. Bryan Is not a candidate for any office
and a mention of him might have, been con
strued by some as an indorsement of him for
office. The vote should have been upon the
naked . proposition to indorse the platform of
last year and then no one could have excused
his abandonment of Democratic principles by
pleading hlg dislike for Mr. Bryan. ,.
The convention not only: failed, but refused
to ~ indorse or reaffirm ' the Kansas City plat
form, and from the manner in which the gold
element had rejoiced over , this failure of the
convention one would suppose - that ' the main
object of the i convention was not to write a
new platform, but to repudiate the one upon
which. the last national campaign was fought.
Bryan insists that the convention made
a mistake in making himself (Bryan) an
issue and says: . .
LINCOLN, Neb., July 15.â In extended
comment on the platform adopted by the
Ohio Democratic Convention, W. J. Bryan
criticizes the convention for its failure
to reaffirm the Kansas City platform, and
for what he regards. as. the weakness of
some of the planks it did adopt.
day. On the man target he made 79 out
of a possible 80. He got three flags In suc
cession and one nineteen, a remarkable
performance. Those who know say that
the prize that will fall to Henderson will
be worth at least $200. Seventy-nine points
have been made several times "before, but
no one has made 80. Of course Hender
son is happy over his success at the
range, but he wears his honors easily and
unostentatiously. Henderson is a mem
ber of the Golden Gate Rifle Club, and he
shoots with a rifle that to him seems re
sponsive to his arms. It weighs fourteen
pounds and has a single trigger, with a
pressure resistance no greater than the
weight of a ID-cent piece. *
Wins Festival Cup.
Theodore R. Geisel of Springfield, Mass.,
won the first festival cup. On the point

300 points and Is thus assured of a cup.

a genuine marksman, there Is no mistak
ing it. On Sunday he won a gold and a
silver medal and now he has a cup to Join

LOS ANGELES. July 15.-The trial of
the damage suit for 550.000 brought by
May Griswold against her brother. Â¦Wil
liam R. Griswold, on account of alleged
false and malicious imprisonment on a
charge of insanity, was resumed in Judge
Allen's court this morning.
Miss Griswold was arrested In Novem
ber. 1900, on a. charge of beine insane, pre
ferred by her brother. She was thrown
into the insane ward of the County Hospi
tal and two or three days later was dis
charged by a Lunacy Commission. Miss
Griswold claims that this act of her broth
er was malicious and has caused her great
bofiily and mental harm, and has been the
mean's of destroying her chances of earn
ing a livelihood through the practice of
her profession, that of music teaching.
Tho feature of the trial to-day was the
visit to the court of the mother of the
contestants, who Is 72 years old. She
could scarcely talk above a whisper, but
her mind appeared strong, and in the
course of the examination she retorted

THE second day of the Third Na
tional Bundes Festival, now In
course at Shell Mound Park, was
strictly a 6hooting affair. Sunday
was a picnic in a long glass, with
a bit of shooting on the side. It was the
rifle yesterday and nothing elseâ except
the natural good-natured and moderate
conviviality that follows whenever a good
ehot or series of good shots is registered.
The conditions for 6hooting were far
better in the morning than in the after
noon. Before the lunch hour the wind
Â¦was mild and not variable and there was
no waving light on the ranges. But un
fortunately few of the marksmen were
present to take advantage of these favor
able shooting conditions. Later on in the
day they arrived and they had their rifles
with them. Some Just came for the
atmosphere â that peculiar, delightful
Fchuetzenfest atmosphere which makes a
holiday and a vacation of e\'erything.
Compared with the vast crowd that con
gested the walks of Shell Mound on Sun
day, there was but a corporal's guard to
watch the shooters yesterday. The band
concert went on Just the same, bo did the
music in the pavilion, but all that exuber
ance of Ufe that characterized the opening
day was lacking. But it will return very
soon, for the crack marksmen are warm
ing their guns and they will bÂ© seen on tha
ranges from this time until tho close of
the fest. The honorary targets had a
pmall patronage, but it is increasing. Some
twenty tickets have been sold and double
that number will be purchased to-day.
Delivers Prize to the Bund.
Captain Emil Berckman of the Independ
ent Hoboken Schuetzen, who is at the
head of his party, delivered the prize of
his organization to the Bund yesterday.
With him are such noted riflemen as Com
missioner John Bruenlng, Gus Eggert and
George Schilling. These experts profess
that they have come to California more
for pleasure than to try to win prizes.
They are to tour the coast before they
return East, but will remain In San Fran
cisco over the Bundesfest and shoot their
best. Captain Berckman is also a mem
ber of the Hobcken Schuetzen Corps, and
hns celebrated his twenty-fifth anniver
sary as shooting king of that organiza
tion. He holds the world's record for
rapid firing, having made 3002 bullseyes In
a weekly shoot of the Plattdeutsche fair
at Terrace Garden. Xew York, In 1S98.
That record has never been equaled. The
nearest to it is Stein's record of 2578.
Captain C. Martens of the Hoboken
Rchuetzen Corps, heading the contingent
rif his club, presented the club trophy and
$59 cash to the Bund yesterday. Captain
John Schuman, an expert shot of the
same club, is one of tho party.

On the standard American target A. H.
Pape achieved something noteworthy. He
shot on the standard American and ring
targets. On the former he made 46, 47
and 49. On the latter out of a possible 73
he shot 71 and 72. Pape Is spoken of as
the boy wonder and a possible king in
future local events, but the older and ex
perienced men laugh quietly when his
name is mentioned.
A. Bergerow of Newark, N. J., a mem

In any way, Dittling's three shots will
bring him a prize worth at least $150.
Harry M. Pope, who is known to shoot

to me, 'Well, Pete, I guess I must go

backward out of the window. I made a
spring to save her, but she disappeared
so quickly that my hands grasped noth

SACRAMENTO. July 15.â A surprise
was sprung at a meeting of the State
Board of Horticulture this afternoon by
the entrance of Thomas Hender of
Tuolumne County with a commission
signed by Governor Gage, announcing his
appointment to succeed W. B. Jester of
Placer County as a member of the board.
It appeared on the face of the commis
sion that Mr. Jester had lost his claim
to membership in the board by reason of
having absented himself from the State
for more than sixty days without having
obtained the consent of the Governor or
the Legislature, as the law provides. The
members expressed astonishment at the
proceeding, having had no previous
knowledge of the appointment, and dele
gations were dispatched to the Gover
nor's ofQce and the Attorney General's
office to ascertain the law in the prem
ises. It-waa agreed that the -ground
stated was a tenable one. Jester admit
ting that for three months past he had
been engaged in mining 1 engineering in
Mexico.
Thcspecial object of the session was to
elect a secretary to succ^'il B. M. Lelonr;
deceased. After another session to-night
the board adjourned without making a
choice. There are nearly a dozen candi
dates for the position, amons them belnsr

fulness engraved upon his face.
Mayor Harrison. May Come.
Julius Salomon, the advance guard of
the Chicago City Rifle Clu*. appeared
upon the,scene during the afternoon. He
brought with him a contribution from the
club, a magnificent clock. He said that
the rest of the delegation remained at
home on account of the Inability of Mayor
Carter Harrison to leave Chicago. If pos
sible Mayor Harrison will make the trip
to the coast. The rest of the delegation
will be here within a few days.
King "William Hayes wa3 in attendance
yesterday, but did no shooting. His Indis
position on Sunday, due to a libation of
ice water, has worn away. He was very
much sought after and Quite a figure
among all his friends. .
Of all the New Yorkers, Captain Her
mann Weber of the Independents draws
popular attention. He and his confreres
have a special brand of Rhine wine which
was shipped to the coast specially for
their consumptionâ and that of their
friends. The captain is a great entertain
er as well as a good shot. A. Bergerow
of the same delegation tried the honorary
target yesterday and ha made a score of
65. The New Yorkers banqueted at the
noon hour a"nd a jovial time they had with
their Rhine wine. . President Kuhls was
a guest and after It was all over they
made speeches and gave all manner of
toasts. Captain Gennerlch's few words
were specially bright and happy.
Makes a Big Score.
Late in the afternoon E. Schmid, presi
dent of the Helvetia Rifle Club of Sacra
mento, scored 68 on the honorary target,
distancing all other registrations up to
that time. F. Pape, who followed Imme
diately after, thought that on his last
shot he tied this performance of the Sac
ramentan. but his shot was 22 Instead of
23, and Pape's score added not â¬S but 67.
Lieutenant Edward H. Goetze of the
San Francisco Schuetzen Vereln surprised
a number of the old-time marksmen by
the accuracy of his aim. He scored two
bullseyes on the target Germania, which
was considered remarkable shooting by
those well versed in the art of the rifle
man. Compared to the result of his three
shots at the target Eureka, the score
counted for little. His shots at the hon
orary target provided one of the surprises
of the day. "When the target secretary
announced that popular Ed Goetze had
made 59 out of a possible 73 the crowd
around the butts awakened the' echoes
with its cheers. He also won a gold
medal by scoring 1 168 on a point target. >

cerned. The most important ticket brok
ing office, however, to be effected in this
city Is that of A. Ottinger at 620 Market
street. The news must have leaked out
yesterday and reached Ottinger's ears, as
he'was busy all the afternoon seeing rail
road officials and telephoning friends
seeking their advice and â succor in his
hour of peril.
Probable "War Against Scalpers.
Those who are well informed around
the yellow building say that this Is the
opening of a determined campaign on the
part of the Southern Pacific Company to
do away with the cut-rate ticket business
in this city. They say that there will be
just- as severe a struggle waged here as
has recently been on between the scalp
ers and the Southern Pacific Company in
New Orleans. The general who outlined
the battle for the railroad company In
that fight was S. F. B- Morse, assistant
traffic manager of the Southern Pacific,
who waged a ceaseless battle to suppress
the ticket brokers in New Orleans. -
Others who were conversant with the
fact that the railroad company intends to
institute injunction proceedings to-day
claim that this is the only move that will
be made by the railroad company. They
say that Ottinger is a popular man with
a number of the high officials of the
Southern Pacific and that he has agreed
to allow the proceedings to be taken and
will make no fight in the matter. Wheth
er he will make a contest remains to be
proved when the papers are served on
It is also supposed that ticket scalpers
in Chicago have bought large quantities
of the Epworth tickets in the East and
â¢will send them to San Francisco to be
disposed of. The regular fare to Chicago
at present is $63, with the exception of
the* excursion rates to the Pan-American
Exposition at Buffalo. The cost of a
whole Epworth League ticket is less than
the regular single fare East. Should the
injunction go into effect even this move
on the part of the ticket scalpers would
be stopped.
PMT^HE cut-rate or more popularly
I â¢ known "scalping" ticket offices in
I this city must go. At least the
II Southern Pacific Company will
this morning institute injunction
proceedings restraining them from^elling
Epworth League tickets. Should the rail
road corporation win this first passage at
arms it is said it will follow up the victory
by petitioning the court to make the in
junction perpetual. .
The Injunction proceedings on the part
of the Southern Pacific Company will
come as a great surprise to all railroad
men, as in the past the cut-rate ticket of
fices in this city have not only been undis
turbed but recognized, and their repre
sentatives have been sold tickets at a
slight discount, so that a small margin of
profit could be made for their trouble in
handling them. _ ,.
This move on the part of the Southern
Pacific Company is looked upon by local
railroad men as a clever ruse. To those
who are not familiar with the Epworth
League special rate that Is now being of
fered and how the Harriman syndicate
will make a rich harvest out of the in
junction proceedings a few words will suf
fice to explain the situation.
At the last meeting of the Transconti
nental Passenger Association, held at Del
Monte, a generous rate of $53 was made to
all members of the Epworth League from
Chicago to San Francisco : and return.
This included a first class ticket both
ways and is less than a half fare. There
are numbers of Eastern people who pat
ronized scalping ticket offices at every
conceivable opportunity. It is an estab
lished fact that numbers of people wish
ing to reside in California purchased tick
ets, representing themselves as members
of the Epworth League, with tne inten
tion of selling their return special rate
ticket when -they arrived in San .Fran
cisco to ticket brokers or scalpers.. .
Continued from Page One.
Many "Will Not Return.
In the same way commercial men could
buy these tickets at a great saving-, and
after disposing of their return tickets on
this end they could return to the East
with many dollars saved: Large numbers
of tickets must have been sold in the
EaM to persons with this idea in view. No
word or warning was given out that in
junction proceedings would ue instituted
to prevent the scalpers selling them, and
the Harriman syndicate now shows its
hand after putting off the injunction pro
ceedings until it felt assured that it has
sold all the tickets it could.
The injunction proceedings will be
commenced this morning in the Superior
Court. The railroad men have already
prepared their affidavits. The paper-*
would have been filed yesterday, only a
delay of one day meant that the news of
the injunction proceedings would not be
telegraphed to the East until a day later
and Eastern people would not be aware
when- buying their tickets in the East
that they would be unable to sell them
upon their arrival in San Francisco.
In the injunction proceedings all the
scalping ticket offices in this city are con-

JUDGE COOK DENIES
BIAS OR PREJUDICE
well Against the Board of
Fire Commissioners.
Refuses to Transfer the Case of Max-
The case of George F. Maxwell against
the Fire Commissioners came up before
Judge Cook yesterday on an affidavit by
the defendants asking, for a transfer of
the case to another court on the ground
of bias and prejudice. A counter affidavit
had been filed by Maxwell, denying there
were any grounds for the allegation of
bias or prejudice on the part of the
Judge. ./ V
After the statements of counsel the
Judge said he had carefully read the affi
davit of the defendants and it did not
allege that he had bias or prejudice
against either of the parties to the case,
which was essential. Personally he would
say that there was not the slightest
ground for the allegation and he woulri
deny the motion for a transfer of the
case, remarking that if the slightest
cause had appeared why the application
should be granted he would have trans
ferred the case on his own motion.
Attorney Lennon aeked that a date be
eet for the trial of the case and Fire
Commissioner McKinEtry said he wanted
to take the matter to the Supreme Court,
as he did not wish the case tried by
Judge Cook. He, therefore, declined to
make any suggestion as to the date
Lennon wanted the case set for trial this
morning, but the Judge fixed upon July
29. and said that meantime McKinstry
could have the matter taken before the
Supreme Court.

To-Night's Grand Concert
The demand for seats for the grand
concert at the Pavilion to-night is un
precedented. Fully 4000/were disposed of
before noon yesterday, and as it was im
possible to supply all requests for them
without using those reserved for general
admission the committee found it neces
sary to reserve every seat In the house.
Even then all orders cannot be filled.
There are S000 seats altogether, of which
number 2000 will be utilized by the chorus.
This leaves only 5000 seats forÂ«ome 20,000
people who are desirous of attending the
concert.
To add to the worry of the committee,
a report was circulated that many of the
choicest seats had been -purchased by
ticket speculators. It is said that one
speculator secured fully 200 seats, â¢which
were purchased by his agents In lots of
frotoi twenty to forty. Whether this re
port Is reliable the future must determine.
At all events this will give those of the
general public who Â¦ have hitherto been
unable to get . seats an opportunity of
hearing the chorus if they .are willing to
pay the commission which will be exacted
by the speculators. Â¦"Â¦-.'
Will Repeat Performance.
One result of the unusual demand for
tickets to the concert has been an order;
from the general committee to repeat it
next Saturday night. It was intended to
repeat the performance next Monday
evening, but It was doubtful if the Los
Angeles section, embracing 750 singers,
would remain in the city until that time.
In order that there might be no disap
pointment the music committee, after a
conference with Chairman Kilben of the
general committee last evening, resolved
to repeat the performance on Saturday
evening. If necessary, a third perform
ance may be given Monday- evening,
though it is" almost certain the chorus
will be greatly reduced in numbers by
that time.
Chairman Filben announced last night
that all general admission tickets Hereto
fore sold and unexchanged for reserved
seats would be honored next Saturday
' evening. The remaining reserved . seats
will be placed on sale thi3 morning at
9:30 o'clock at the Pavilion, "h.Â£: , i -.-V 7 v

THE UNION PACIFIC GENERAL
AGENT IN THIS CITY, WHO
WILL RETIRE. >.
WORD has been received in this
city that the Southern Pacific
and Union Pacific passenger
and freigrht offices in Cali
fornia are to be' consolidated
in "the near future. It is stated on the
most reliable authority that Traffic Direc
tor Stubbs wired from Chicago the latter
part of last week to the Union Pacific of
ficials all over California directing them
to at once forward to him a list giving the
names of all men employed in the Union
Pacific offices in this State, the length of
time they had been employed by the com
pany, what salaries they are receiving,
also what rent is being paid for the of
fices, and last, but not least, the actual
expenses of the offices. The offices of the
two railroads will be consolidated in the
near future and thousands of dollars will
be saved to the Harriman syndicate by
this move.
With the new order of things Colonel D.
W. Hitchcock, general agent of the Union
Pacific in this city, will be treated }n ex
actly the same manner as Jerome' Fill
more â he will be pensioned off at a good
salary in recognition of his splendid work
during the many years h$ has been with
the Union Pacific. Thomas Schumacher,
the chief freight officer of the Union Pa
cific, will still hold a responsible position,
but he will be moved over to the big yel
low building and will work in conjunction
with William Sproule, who has charge of
the Southern Pacific freight traffic de
partment in this city.
Tho following figures that were for
warded to Traffic Director Stubbs, as he
had- requested, are interesting at this
time. At the San Jose office one official is
employed at a salary of $125 a mdnth, the
rent is $25 and the working expenses
amount to $75 more, making a grand total
of $225. The Sacramento office employs
two men at $150 and $S5 respectively. â¢ The
rent for office is $25 and the working ex
penses $100, making a total of $360 per
month. â¢ The Los Angeles office of the
Union Pacific employs five representatives,
one at ?200, two H at $125, one at $100 and
one at S75 per month. The salary roll
alone amounts to $625 in Los Angeles and
in the report the expenses ran close upon
$1500 a month. .> . . . * . . , . .
With the consolidation of the Union Pa
cific and Southern Pacific offices the ex
penses .will be cut down materially and
just as good results can be accomplished,
at least so Harriman and Stubbs think.
Just when the change will be made is not
at present known, but it is almost certain
t.o take place in the next thirty days. ,
THOUSANDS OF LEAGUERS
WILL REACH CITY TO=DAY
Comte A. de Trobriand, former* Consul
General of France In this city, has but
little confidence in the courts of Califor
nia. The probate departments of the
Superior Court are less honored than the
Â¦others by this diplomat. In fact he be
lieves them to be "crooked,"' organized
and maintained by the' people for the pur
pose of looting rich estates when there
were rich estates to loot and poor estates
when others were not available. Ha
probably arrived at his conclusion from
reading of incidents of the kind men
tioned that have occurred in the courts
of this city.
De Trobriand's opinion came to light
yesterday during the trial of an action
instituted by Attorney S. T. Brun to re
cover $S22 40 from the estate of the late
Emilie de Chavanne, who died In Grass
Valley, Nevada County, two years ago.
Emilie de Chavanne's sister. Mme.
Waskiewiez, who resides in Paris,
France, heard of the death of her sister.
She notified De Trobriand that she and
her three sons were heirs-at-law of the
deceased and entitled to her estate and
askd the Consul to take steps to protect
her rights.
De Trobriand appointed Attorney Brun
to represent the claimants, but before he
had fairly started to work an attorney
to represent absent heirs, which included
the claimants, was appointed by the
Nevada County court. This left Attorney
Brun minus a job and he forthwith took
steps to put the Nevada County attorney
for absent heirs out of his office. He
wrote to the heirs in France, reflecting
on California courts in r^neral and at
torneys for absent heirs * In particular,
which expression of opinion De Trobriand
concurred in.
Letter Bead in Court.
During the hearing yesterday there was
considerable controversy as to the proper
interpretation of certain telegrams, which
Brun presented on the claim that they
authorized his appointment by the former
Consul General. No serious controversy
arose, however .until after Brun testified
that his usual commission in such cases
Â¦was 5 per cent upon the value of the
estate. It was then that Attorney I. I.
Brown, representing the defendants,
found opportunity to introduce Brun's
letter, indorsed by the former Consul
General, showing' that though he placed
a fair value on his services he placed a
low value on the honor of California
courts and attorneys for absent heirs.
The letter reads:
SAN FRANCISCO. October 30, 1899.
Sir: Tou let me know that Mr. FTicot has
written you that the court has appointed an
attorney, and that in consequence you have
no more need of my services. Allow me to
explain to you our California procedure.
The court, which is composed of but one
Judge, can officially appoint an attorney to
represent the absent heirs. This attorney Is
appointed only until the heirs have made a
choice. As soon as the heirs have appointed
their own representative the attorney for the
court withdraws. This attorney may be chosen
among one of the friends of the Judge or upon
the recommendation of the executors. This
position of attorney for the absent heirs is
very profitable. His fees are fixed by the
court, upon the representations of colleagues
Â¦who are interested in the matter, and often the
absent heirs pay out of their shares more than
the pen-ices are worth. This is why the heirs
prefer appointing themselves their attorney,
with whom they can have an understanding as
It le easy to see that if the attorney has
been appointed by the court upon the recom
mendation of the executors this attorney can
very well close his eyes upon voluntary errors
that may have slipped into the accounts of
the executor. The latter will remember the
sen-ice when the fees of such attorney will
have to be fixed. â¢ â¢ â¢ .
A Saving Clause.
An this is said in a general sort of a way
without accusing 1 any one in the Chavanne
estate of sinister motives. I send you inclosed
4 'L' Impartial Californien" and the commen
taries of the French paper that may give you
more information. â¢ â¢ â¢
If you wish to withdraw your power of at
torney from me you are at liberty to do so,
but it Is my duty outside of my personal in
terests to tell you that instead of paying 3
per cent out of your legacy you may have to
pay 10 r*r cent. â¢ â¢ â¢
I add but one more word, and that is that
I will pray Mr. , the Consul General, to
read this letter, and If what I say of the pro
cedure is correct to be kind enough to certify
to it Please receive, dear sir. the expression
of my distinguished sentiments.
S. T. BRUN.
To this letter Consul General de Tro
briand appended the following certificate:
I. the undersigned Consul Genera], intrusted
with the consulate of France in San Fran
cisco, having become acquainted with the let
ter of Mr. Brun. certify that the Information
contained In this letter is perfectly exact, as
far as the mode of procedure of American Jus
tice in the matter of an estate opened in the
State of California is concerned.
(SÂ«a! of Consulate.) A. DE TROBRIAND.
San Francisco. October 30. 1899.
Attorney Brown gave vent to harsh In
vective over this letter. Such letters, he
said, coming from a California attorney
were an insult to the bench and bar of
the State. De Trobriand 1 s concurrence in
the opinion Mr. Brown said he would put
down to ignorance, but that a practicing
attorney should so vilify the courts he
believed a sufficient basis for drastic ac
tion.
The court made no comment when the
letter was read, but from his expression
it is evident that the matter will be per
sued further when the case is again
called for hearing.

CONSUL ATTACKS
PROBATE COURTS
The fraudulent looting of the Continent
al Salt and Chemical Company out s of
stock valued at $171,000 has been charged
to Sheriff John Lackmann, former Mayor
L..R. Ellert and L. A. Berteling, the op
tician, in an action instituted yesterday
by William J. Dingee, William G. Hen
shaw and Oscar T. Weber." In the treas
ury of the corporation, the complainants
aver, the only evidence of consideration
for the stock in question Is three promis
sory notes, one for $5000 signed by Lack
mann, another for $5000 signed by Ellert
and the third for $9000 bearing the signa
ture of Berteling. Even the payment of
these notes has not seriously occupied the
attention of the defendants, the plaintiffs
claim, "and each of them is long past due
and is now payable." â¢
By way of introduction to the caustic
paragraphs to come the plaintiffs, set
forth the fact that the Continental Salt
and Chemical Company is a corporation
organized for profit; that its capital stock
is $200,000, divided Into 400,000 shares of the
par value of 50 cents a share, of which
168,500 shares were duly and regularly
sold and issued prior to January 14 of
this year. The stock so sold and issued.
was owned on that day as follows:
Sell Themselves Stocks.
John Lackmann, 20,100 shares; I* R. Ellert,
20,100; L. A. Berteilngr, 44,100; H. C. Coward.
40,100; Oscar T. Weber, 4100, and L. A. Bertel
ing as trustee, 40,000.
Lackmann, J3!lert, Berteling, Coward
and Weber, constituting the board of di
rectors, called a meeting for" January 14,
the complaint recites. On that day Lack
mann, Ellert and Berteling voted to
authorize the board of directors to sell to
themselves 76.000 shares of the capital
stock of the corporation at 25 cents a
share, Lackmann and Ellert to take 20,000
shares each and Berteling 36,000 shares.
The proposition offered by Lackmann, El
lert and Berteling was immediately op
posed by Weber, it is alleged, but as
Lackmann, Ellert and Berteling held the
majority of stock they overruled Weber
and declared Themselves owners of the
stock in the proportions named and -for
the price stated.
At the same time, sitting as a board of
directors, it is alleged that Lackmann.
Ellert and Berteling accepted in the name
of the corporation their own promissory
notes for the turns set forth above, and
deposited the same in the treasury. The
notes, it is set forth, were for ninety days
without Interest.
At the time Lackmann, Ellert and Ber
teling thus possessed themselves .of the
76,000 shares of the capital stock of the
corporation at one-half the par value of
the same it is alleged that the assets of
the corporation had greatly* increased in
value, until the market price of the stock
exceeded $2 50 a share.
Charges of Fraud. V
Following this allegation the plaintiffs
begin to stimulate their complaint with
charges of fraud. Lackmann, Ellert and
Bertaling, they say, acted fraudulently
and in violation of their duty to the other
stockholders and contrary to the best in
terests of the corporation, and they there
by damaged the corporation in the sum of
$171,000, and damaged the plaintiff, Weber,
in the sum and amount which the shares
of capital stock then owned by him bear
to the 168,500 shares sold and issued prior
to January 14.
On April 27 last Weber sold to William
J. Dingee and William G. Henshaw, who
are joined with him as plaintiffs, 1035
shares each of â¢ the capital stock of the
corporation. H. C. Coward also sold a
portion of his stock to Dingee and Hen
shaw, Â¦ each taking off his hands 10,025
shares. Coward, as . the owner of the
40,000 shares held in trust by Berteling,
also sold Dingee and Henshaw 10,000
shares each of the stock so held in trust,
and as the owners thereof they are joined
as plaintiffs. ' ;Â¦ ' '. .
Weber Tiles "Written Demand.
Immediately after the transfer of the
stock to Dingee and Henshaw had been
i effected Weber filed a written demand
with the board of directors of the corpora
,tion. Including Lackmann, Ellert and Ber
teling. requesting as a stockholder "that
the board of directors forthwith Institute
suit against Lackmann, Ellert and Bertel
ing to recover damages for 'their fraudu
lent action.". The board of directors,

during the remainder of this month:
Knights of Pythias. .
The autopsy on Walsh's body showed
that death was caused by hemorrhage
from a knife wound in the groin.
Walsh lived with his father at 24 Mor
ris avenue. . He was employed as a driver
for Steele's dairy, Point Lobos road.
Pettigrew for some time worked . as a
laborer on Union Island . in the San
Joaquin and came to the city about a
week ago. He was born at Twentieth
and Mission streets. .
â¢ The murder of Lafayette Al .."Walsh out
side the Chutes early yesterday morning,
an account 'of which was published ex
clusively in The Call, appears from those
who witnessed it to have been deliber
ately done.. Four of the' witnesses, Ward
low Dennis, a soldier; Clarence Anderson,
Percy Benson and Joseph , Whalen, are
detained in the City Prison pending the
giving of their evidence at the Coroner's
Inquest. .-...; .â¢
Emmet N. Pettigrew, who is accused
of having committed' â¢ the "murder, ap
peared in Judge Conlah's court yesterday
morning. He was instructed as .to his
rights and by consent the case was con
tinued till to-day. â¢
The murder .was the culmination of a
drunken .row. Pettigrew, Walsh and
Whalen met at, Whalen' s house, 16 Erie
street, Sunday night and left with the
incentlon of going to the Chutes. They
had several drinks : on.' the way and went
into a saloon at Halght and Stanyan
streets, where they met Benson â¢ and An
derson and Dennis. Benson and another
driver of a dairy .wagon named Herman
Rlese had a fight three weeks ago |at
Twenty-first and .Mission streets, and
while drinking in- the saloon- Walsh of
fered to fight Whalen, who was a friend
of Riese. They were ordered out of the
saloon and continued; their wrangling
while walking in the direction of the en
trance of the Chutes. ' Walsh struck at
Whalen and ran across the street, fol
lowed by Pettigrew. Dennis, the soldier,
saw Pettigrew put his hand into his hip
pocket, draw a knife and make a lunge
at Walsh's abdomen. Walsh sprang into
a hack and asked William Cummings,
the driver, to take him to. the city quick.
Cummings took him out of the hack and
laid him on the ground, as he had fainted.
Walsh was carried into the Chutes by
Policemen Reade and Lord and died on
his way to the Receiving Hospital in the
patrol wagon.
Fettigrew and Whalen went into - the
Chutes and the former was arrested by
Policeman Reade and Identified by Den
nis. Pettigrew admitted stabbing Walsh
and said he did it because Walsh had
struck his friend, Whalen. â¢ I

WALSH'S MURDER
DELIBERATE ONE
Louis Dunn. Jack Hayes, the ex-base
ball player, and several others were sit
ting at the same table when the trouble
occurred, but they failed to see the cut
ting.
Last- night the wounded man was rest
ing quietly, and the attending physician
gave out that* unless blood poisoning set
in he would recover.
The woman positively declares that she
did not see a knife in the hands of
Moran.
"I can prove that I did - not cut him.
After we mixed It several persons took a
hand in the row, and I suppose that one
of them inflicted the wound."
"Vivian Gray corroborates Moran's story
as to the tintype.
"I was slightly acquainted with
Birdsall," 1 he said shortly after his ar
rest, "and at the invitation of a woman,
who is known as Vivian Gray. I sat
down at the table occupied by him and
his friends. The woman had a tintype of
myself and a friend, and she insisted on
showing it around. As the tintype caused
considerable laughter I asked hor to re
turn It to me, when it suddenly disap
peared. Thinking that Birdsall had it I
asked him for it, when he made some im
pertinent remarks. I replied, and then he
jumped out of his chair and, struck me.
The next instant a policeman grabbed me
and hustled me out of the "pavilion. I
started back with the intention of apol
ogizing to Birdsall when I was told that
he had Wen stabbed.
Birdsall's friends who were with him
when the cutting occurred disclaimed any
knowledge of his assailant. Billy Abbott,
the notorious divekeeper, was present
when the stabbing occurred, and as it was
claimed that he had a hand in the mix-up
the police .arrested him on suspicion of
having used the knife. Abbott vociferous
ly declared that he knew nothing of the
cutting, but despite his protestations he
was taken to the City Prison and locked
up in the tanks.
Last night Police Officer Maurice Be
han arrested Moran and charged him
with the crime. Moran had a discolored
optic as the result of coming in contact
with Birdsall's fist. He denied having
cut Birdsall, and claims that he will be
able to prove his innocence by at least
half a dozen people. â¢ '
Moran immediately disappeared, while
the friends of the wounded man rallied to
his assistance. He was at once placed in
a hack and hurriedly driven to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where an examination dis
closed that he had been cut three times in
the region of the groin. The wounds were
dressed and the rnjured man was removed
to his home at 1454 Leavenworth street.
' Birdsall was . sitting at a table in the
dancing pavilion at the Chutes with sev
eral friends when some words passed be
tween him and Moran over a tintype,
which the latter claimed was his property.
Moran, it is claimed, applied a vile epi
thet to Birdsall, whereupon the latter
struck him in the face. Birdsall started
to follow up his advantage when he sud
denly fell back- with the cry: "He cut
me!"
George Birdsall,' son of Lieutenant of
Police Birdsall, was stabbed and seriously
wounded early yesterday morning while
attending the French celebration at the
Chutes. Marshall Moran, a barkeeper, his
alleged assailant, is under arrest, charged
with an assault to commit murder. . ;

Assailant, Is Arrested and

AT THE CHUTES
The Chutes has a strong bill this week.
Coleman and Mexls are wonderful rifle
shots, performing difficult feats. P. J
Duffy plays the concertina in a clever
manner. Kalacratus repeated his former
success -with his novelty juggling and
hoop rolling. Others numbers are Flatt
and Sutherland, Spenser Kelly, P. Rich
ards and new moving pictures.

Fischer's Concert House.
Fischer's Concert House was well filled
last night by an audience amply apprecia
tive of the good programme. James J.
Mackay sang some good songs of his own
composition that were very well received,
and Clinton. Montgomery, the barytone,
also shared in the applause. Signors
Buzzi and Wanrell and Miss Cha,rity Mar
tin rendered the terzetto from "Ernani"
to enthusiastic applause, and the dancing
of the three Kelly sisters and the sketch
presented by Miss Alice Wren and Clar
ence Lyndon were appreciated. Mr. Hin
richs', orchestra maintained Its good repu
tation. Â¦ .
The third week of the Tivoli's midsum
mer piece, "The Babes in the "Wood,"
opened to a good house last night, and the
precious pair were as amusing as. ever.
Hartman's new topics were all warmly re
ceived, and.Cashman- ably assisted the
principal comedian in the work of making
laughs. Cunningham's singing is much
admired and Webb and Annie Myers keep
the fun going. The Tivoli announces that
the advance sale for the season of grand
opera, which commences on July 29, will
open on Wednesday morning, July 17. The
regular sale for the opening week begins
Monday, the 22d.
Tivoli.
Tha Orpheum has a programme of stars
this weekâ stars that are twinkling here
for. the first time and stars who. were the
twinklers of the past week. The Chev
alier Enrico Mario Scognamillo, the world
famous 'cellist, made his first appearance
In his wonderful performance on the al
most human instrument and found ready
recognition. Charles Leonard Fletcher pre
sents much that Is new, amusing and en
tertaining in the monologue line. Etta
Butler is making her last appearance in
vaudeville and for her farewell is giving
her very best imitations; The Damm
brothers, celebrated European acrobats,
are nothing less than wonderful. The
hold-overs are Gilbert and Goldie with a
bunch of new jokes, the famous Prosper
troupe, Clayton "White and clever Marie
Stuart In their bright sketch "Geraldine,"
and Irving Jones with a batch of 'new
songs, jents and monologues. The Ameri
can biograph still holds a prominent place
on the bill and shows a series of views
of the Pan-American Exposition.
Orpheum.
The exquisite comedy, "The School for
Scandal," commenced Its second week .at
the "Alcazar Theater last night, to a
crowded house. Its presentation by* this
admirable stock company has much to be
commended arid ' little to be" condemned.
Miss Florence Roberts is Â¦ charming as
Lady Teazle and is ably supported by
Barton Hill as Sir Peter Teazle and by
White Whlttlesey as Charles Â¦ Surface.
Most of the other characters are well sus
tained, the most marked exception being
the carelessness of Edwin Emery. He
gives the impression of a twentieth cen
tury hoodlum instead of a gentleman of
the eighteenth century. Next week "The
Country Girl" will be produced.
Native Daughters.
The officers of Fremont Parlor, N. D.
G. W.. were installed last week In the
presence of a large r.umber of the mem

Edward Clifford, proprietor of the Ohio
saloon at 528 Pacific street, was stabbed
in the- back early yesterday morning In
his paloon by- Frank Brown, a colored
man, who made his escape after the stab
bing,- although pursued for some distance
by a policeman.
Frank Quinley and John Green, white
men, had been at the Chutes with Brown
ar.d another colored man, known as
"Jo-Jo." After leaving the Chutes they
went to Pacific street and Green and
"Jo-Jo" began to fight opposite Clifford's
saloon. Clifford went outside to see the
fight and encouraged Green. This angered
Brown and he followed Clifford into his
saloon and stuck a penknife into his back,
leaving it there. Policeman Men'.han
chased Brown, but was unable to over
take him. Clifford refused to go to the
Receiving Hospital and haA his wound
dressed by his own physician.
Detective Reynolds and Armstrong
have been detailed on the case. They ar
rested Quinley and "Jo-Jo," but Clifford
gaid they had nothing to do with the
stabbing'and they were discharged. The
detectives are searching for Brown.

Every seat in the house last night was
taken, and although the performance
did not come to an end before 11:25 the
audience would have waited much longer

Jules Verne's "Michael Strogoff" is one
of the most eventful and exciting, of all
the gifted Frenchman's productions) and
it will always remain a. favorite as long
as melodrama continues to be a weak
ness of human nature. "Michael Stro
goff" is presented at the Central with an
elaborateness as to scenery and stage set
ting that is seldom accorded to melo-'
drama, and the care that has been taken
by the management in the production of
the play will be rewarded by big houses
during the week.
Central.
The fourth .and positively the last week
of "Under Two Flags" began last night
at the Columbia Theater, with a crowded
house to its credit. This is by much the
most successful run of the season here,
and Miss Bates' impersonation of the
heroine is one of the most thrilling dra
matic features of the day.
An event of most exceptional interest
will be the performance of Ibsen's drama,
"Hedda Gabler." that will be given by
Miss Bates and her company next Friday
afternoon at the Columbia Theater,. It is
one of the rarest of local opportunities.
Ibsen's plays are only too seldom seen
anywhere, here practically never, and the
part of Hedda Gabler is one of magnifi
cent, opportunity for an actress. It is also
one of Miss Bates' most favored roles and
offers a chance of contrast with her pres
ent role of Cigarette that could not have
been more adroitly chosen.
Trie matinee will begin at 2;30 sharp.
Chauncey Olcott, in "Garrett O'Magh,
the new Irish play, will follow.
WHAT was the matter with E.
J. Morgan last night? ,
It cannot have been the
play, the new rubber-tired,
gilt-edged, steam-heated mel
odrama that is the Frawley offering of
the week. "The White Heather," by
Messrs. Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamil
ton? Mr. Morgan has the title role of the
heroâone of them, that is, for the play
is lavishly fitted up in this particular.
He has the inestimable privilege of res
cuing the record of the deceived angel's
marriage with the villainâ and such a vil
lain, look you!â in a snug fit of a diving
suit, from the bottom of the deep blue
tea. And still Mr. Morgan did not look
satisfied. To be sure, he did not yet the
lady, whom he also is in love with, be
cause, as he is only a gamekeeper^ It
would disappoint too seriously the Bow
Bells" audience, to whom the play makes
special appeal. But the gamekeeper has
opportunity afforded him for a Glorious
Death, coincidently with the opportunity
to basn the villain on the head, and takes
both ungratefully, without even a thank
you" to the authors, who have given him
such unusual chance for showing- what he
can do. What was the matter with Mor-
The rest of the company just turned
in and enjoved themselves with The
White Heather," along -with the gener
ously enthusiastic audience. Mary Van
Buren, as a dashing widow, Lady Janet
McClintock, beamed brightly through the
eleven scenes of the play, turning up with
a brilliant cheerfulness whenever the
fancy took her. Harrington Reynolds
fairly wallowed in the sumptuous villainy
of the part of Lord Angus Cameron,
piling on the, agony with a delightfully
vicious air. Theodore Roberts Introduced
a serious bit of good work as James
Hume, the Deserted Damsel's papa, and
the lady herself, who made all the trouble
by not permitting her titled husband s
brother, the Dook, to cut off the entail,
was played with Intelligent appreciation
bv Katherine Grey. The E>ook's part is
done by H. S. Duffleld. with a becoming
sense of its unimportance, and a feminine
quartet of the British aristocracy is paro

ford. Christine Hill, Margaret Smith and
Pearl Landers.
"The White Heather" is well staged,
Eplendidly staged in parts. The picnic
scene at the beginning is a delight, and
thÂ» gods whistled their old-time chorus
as the mysteries of Davy Jones' locker
came into view, and a real live automo
bile backed up into Battersea Gardens.

: Various Union Matters.
;-In the latter part of June there was a
Â¦conference at the Palace Hotel, at which
.Messrs*. Dodd and Arnold represented the
Metal Trades Association and Wisler and
Fitzpatrick. the striking ironworkers.
Matters were progressing fairly well un
til the Municipal League interfered. A
settlement might have been reached at
that time, or a little later, but the con
ciliatory committee, while it accomplished
but little, has succeeded in tangling mat
. ters= so that no one knows exactly the
status of the situation. That the Iron
workers are ready to settle matters and
recede from many of their former de
mands is made evident by the foregoing
letter. It Is asserted by those in author
ity that a compromise may be effected in
a few daye. but what causes may Influ
ence the movement yet remains to be
â¢seen. .
Irving M. Scott of the Union Iron
"Works says that the nine-hour work day
will not be granted. He had heard yes
terday of the compromise offered by the
ironworkers, but expressed his opinion
that nothing hut a work day of ten hours
would be considered. The machinists are
equally determined to stand out for the
f.ine-hour work day.
"While none of the members of the Iron
Trades Council is willing to discuss the
situation, Mr. Jenks, to whom the letter
was addressed, says that according to his
understanding the machinists and others
interested in the strike have agreed to
submit the entire matter to arbitration,
their scle demand being for a nine-hour
day. with the question of evertime to be
based upon the day's pay that may later
be settled upon.
Favor Arbitration.
We inclose you a copy of the last request
made in connection with the movement for the
Fhorter workday, which, compared with the
original requests, will show tbat the signing
of the written agreement, the apprenticeship
clause and the Krievance clause have been
waived, and outside of the nine-hour day the
committee has authority to discuss all other
l>oir.ts. Trusting the above is satisfactory, 1
remain, respectfully yours,
W1L.LIAM P. McCABE,
President Iron Trades Council.
Â¦\Vhen the Ironworkers went out on
May 20 a demand was made for a nine
hour work day at the eame relative rate
as was given for ten hours' work, but
with an Increase of pay of 12*4 per cent.
Other conditions were also Imposed relat
ing to overtime, apprentices and other in
cidental features. Efforts to settle the
controversy proved without results until
yesterday, wnen Livingston Jenks, chair
man of the conciliatory committee, re
ceived the following letter:
SAJf FRANCISCO. July 13, 1301.
Livingston Jenks Esq., chairman conciliatory
committee â Dear Sir: In reply to your letter
Ma etate that a committee has been appointed
with full power to act.
It Is now only the Question of one hour
and the rate of pay to be set for the
clay's work that separates the striking
ironworker from resuming his former
employment and ending: the controversy
which commenced eigrht weeks ago. The
Ironworkers are ready to waive many of
the demands for which they have stub
bornly fought. Conferences between the
men on 6trlke and the representatives of
the men who employed them have been
many and frequent and at last a basis of
arbitration has been reached.
Status of Strike Puzzling,
With Signs of Early
Settlement.
Strikers Abate Demands
and Await Further
Overtures.
READY TO MEET
FOR DISCUSSION

killed him. He was then himself arrested and locked

WHEN the Russians / projected their various
lines across Asia they did not contemplate
' the possibility of a rival arising to cross
their paths. At the earliest suggestion of the con
struction of a railway from Constantinople eastward
across Southern Asia to India and to China they en
tered a formal protest, and their influence with the
Sultan was sufficiently strong to prevent him for many
a year from granting such a concession. Finally,
however, Germany and Great Britain combined were
able to overcome the opposition and a number of Ger
man capitalists, haying the support of their Govern
ment, obtained a concession to construct a road from
Angora, the present terminus of a German railway in
Asia Minor, through the .valley of the Euphrates, to
El Kuweit, on the Persian Gulf.
The distance from the Bosporus to the Persian
Gtilf is about 1750 miles.' From that point the next
project would be to extend the road still farther v east
so as to connect it with the railway. systems of India
and China. A recent description of the- projects says'
that from El Kuweit across t Persia to Baluchistan,
where the British sphere of influence begins, would
require the construction of a line about 700 miles.
From that point to "Kurrachee, in Western British

THE Marin Tocsin despairs of defending the
base and slopes of Mount Tamalpais from fires
set by vandals and the hoodlums who resort
there for Sunday sinning. Annually for several years
the mountain has beea attacked by fire until its
bearded cheeks are getting bare, and the umbrageous
delights which its forests offered are going up in
smoke and down in ashes. It is the source of water
supply for the towns around its base, and its con
servation of moisture is the cause of fertility of all the
region over which it stands guard. These are func
tions of the mountain, however, for which the Sun
day picnic blackguard cares nothing. He is bent on
destruction. If he can start a forest fire it increases
what he thinks is his happiness and enjoyment of
life. These wretches have been known to interfere
with the settlers of that region in their effort to put
out fires. They make Sunday a day of terror and
peril. The Tocsin says the citizens are utterly un
zble to cope with them, and have learned that it is
dangerous to resist them at all. It is concluded,
therefore, that the only way to save the forests of the
mountain and preserve the peace of that region is
by making it a Federal reservation; connected with
Lime Point military reservation, and putting it under
military patrol and control.
We sympathize, warmly with the proposition to pro
tect the mountain and the peace and order of the
tract that must be traversed to gain access. to its sum
mit. But we wish that Marin County would first
prove that it can compel order and punish disorder
within its borders. The United States will not ac
cept as a gift a reservation upon the plea that the
local authorities cannot keep the peace there, and
the soldiers are needed to act as gendarmes for that
purpose. Disorders of that kind are common to all
large cities, and it would be a hazardous precedent to
set if their existence were made the reason for as
suming Federal jurisdiction and having permanent
martial law. There are many reasons why an exten
sion of Lime Point military reservation would be de
sirable, and as such policy would serve the purposes
of the General Government and of the local people
it should be carried cut, . . *â¢

CORN STARCHâ F. H. A., Exeter. Cal.
The general process of manufacturing
corn starch is as follows: The corn is first
macerated in a weak alkaline solution,
containing about 200 grains of caustic
soda to a gallon of water. This alkali dis
solves the gluten, but leaves the starch in
the grain. After standing about twenty
four hour^ the alkaline liquid is drawn
off and the grain, after be:ng well washed.
Is drained and is then ground into flour.
A fresh quantity of lye is added to it. and
It is again digested for twenty-four hours
or so. with frequent stirring. It is then
left for about seventy hours, in -which
time the dissolved gluten rises and forms
a yellowish stratum at the top. This part
is carefully drawn off, leaving the fibrous
part of the grain at the bottom, inter
mixed-with starch. â¢ This deposit 13 then
washed with cold water several times and
! the water drawn off until nothing is left
but the fibrous part of the grain, while
the water which has carried off the starch
in solution deposits it In a perfectly pure
condition. The starch,' when perfectly
dry.- is packed for. market.. TheÂ» yield is
about twenty-five pounds to a bushel of
corn. Â¦.-"Â¦'Â¦ J. Â¦Â¦â¢

These corrupt bosses are assisted in their schemes
by JohnX. Lynch, W. F.; Herrin, Jere .Burke and
other employes of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The order of President Hays that the employes the
road must keep out' of politics has been violated. Her
rin and Kelly were never in closer communion than
they are now.
. . If in a contest of this kind the Republican State
Committee interfere it will seriously compromise the
campaign. The Republicans of San Francisco un
derstand the whole situation. They have determined
to have honest primaries under the law and to drive
the disreputable bosses out of the party. It -is an
issue that is strictly local. It is, moreover, one upon
which the better elements of the Republican party
are in earnest. They do not intend to be dictated
to by Kelly, Crimmins, Lynch, 'Burke, Herrin .and
the rest.
The men who are engineering the scheme are well
known. They are the familiar bosses, Kelly and
Crimmins, who are not now nor have ever been Re
publicans in any true sense of the word, but are merely
mercenary politicians, dealers in all kinds of jobs,
and just as ready to knife the party ticket as to sup
port it. These men are in close relation with Demo
cratic bosses of their own type, and woul^ not hesi
tate to bring the heelers of the Democratic camp into
Republican primaries any more than they would to
send their own heelers into Democratic primaries.
That statement is decidedly deceptive. It conveys
the idea that the Republicans of this city are divided,
whereas there is no division among genuine Repub
licans at all. At the last municipal nominating con
vention a committee was appointed to hold office
and represent the municipal Republican party for two
years. There is no other committee that disputes that
claim. Its title is not only undeniable, but is ac
tually undenied. Under that committee the Repub-^
licans of the city have organized and ftave prepared
for the primaries. There are no divisions among
them, no factions and no dissensions. All are in
favor of fair and honest primaries conducted in the in
terest of no particular candidates, and* designed solely
to elect to the nominating convention thoroughly;
representative Republicans who will nominate men
worthy of the party and of. the offices to which they
aspire, and who if elected will provide the city with
an efficient and economical administration.
The movement for honest primaries carried forward
with so much vigor under the direction of the Pri
mary League was a warning to the bosses- that they
would have no longer any power to do corrupt poli
ties'^ the name of the Republican party. They there
fore at once set about devising means for breaking
into the party under any kind ol pretense. They
found a committee that had been appointed by' a
State convention to arrange for nominating candi
dates for the Legislature, and they obtained control
of it. It had never anything to do with municipal
affairs, and yet the claim is made that it is authorized
to act for the Republican party in this municipal cam
paign. It is to support that claim that an appeal has
been made to the State Committee.
In the call for a meeting of the State Central Com
mittee Chairman Stone says: "Two organizations,
each claiming to be the Republican County Commit
tee of the city and county of San Francisco, have filed
petitions with the Board of Election Commission
ers," and he adds that he has received a written re
quest from one of the two committees asking that the
State Committee be convened to hear the claims of
the two and determine which is legally/entitled to act
as the Republicap County Committee.
THE FIGHT OF THE . BOSSES.
HAD any proof been needed of the. wisdom ,of j
genuine Republicans 'in organizing to assure;
the holding of fair and honest primary elec- â¢
tions under the law, it would be found in the efforts,
now being made by the old bosses to get control of
the party machinery and dominate the . primaries in >Â¦
spite of the law. These bosses have set. up a so-called
Republican County - Committee of their own, and,
fearing to submit its claims to the Board of Election
Commissioners, have appealed to the Republican
State -Central, Committee for recognition and sup
port.

Such, perhaps, was what Professor Wendell de
sired to say, but outside of Harvard the meaning of
"little" is not regarded as expressive of the thought
he thought he thought. Very short jwords may.be
very, great words indeed; for instance, the three let
tered name: of the Deity. Love, hate, truth, age, day,
night, light, dark, man, death, life, home, hope, help,
are all short words, but so great that the language
cannot spare them. Slop is also a short word, but in
another class. We suggest to the summer class that
it cram some Harvard English and "use it in future
compositions, and then Professor Wendell may smile
upon his students and slop over no more.
.Professor Wendell himself is an author of limited
but proved- fecundity. ; One Â«f his books is a guide,
philosopher and friend to "English composition." In
it he criticizes two compositions, saying: "Simpler
words and littler, these last." The chumps of lexi
cographers say, "Little, less, least," and eschew
"Little, littler, littlest." If one not a Harvard pro
fessor had desired to commend abstention from poly
syllables the sentence would have been made this way:
"Simpler words and shorter, these last." '
He should shuffle that sentence again- and accord
ing to the Harvard model deal it this way: "We is
glad to have a man here who are big enougli to criti
cize us." . ,
Let even Professor Wheeler beware lest he too get
on the Index Expurgatorious which Professor Wen
dell carries in his head, for did he not say: "We'are
glad to have a man here who is big enough to criti
cize us"? . i
If the Berkeley summer class had gone to these
models its work would not now be going glimmer
ing to limbo in a critical garbage cart as slop too dis
gusting for the Harvard sensibilities.
. When a verb and its nominative are joined to
geth'er in number and person let no man put them
asunder unless he is a Harvard professor.
Just look at that disjunctive conjunction! It was
after- a singular verb, and when it caught a plural it
Jocked like a bluefisher that lands a menhaden.
Again, Professor James says: "The great memory
for facts which" a Darwin or a Spencer reveal in their
books is not incompatible with the possession, of a
mind with only a middling degree of psychological
I retentiyeness." And yet again: "A river or'a stream
are the metaphors by which, it is most naturally de
scribed."
Professor James writes books to teach others how
to catch and tame the soul. In one of these, called a
"Briefer Course," in which soul trapping is taught
across lots, he says: "I suspect that neither the na
ture nor the amount of our work are accountable for
the frequency and severity of our breakdowns."
WE recently referred to the importation of
Harvard methods in criticism solely for the
use of the university 'summer 'school" at
Btrkeley. There have been plain, unfrilled critics in
California. John Vance Cheney has published most
instructive criticisms and reviews! but, while able to
point out even where Jove nods in composition, he
never rose to the sublime height whereon Professor
Wendell perched and denounced the papers written
by his class as "disgusting slop."
Harvard is a fountain of criticism, not summer criti
cism merely, for, like death, it has all seasons for its
own. We will riot enlarge upon other features com
mon to the two. Harvard is a' well of English, but
there may be some albuminoid, ammoniacal English
in it. It is to be regretted that when Professor Wen
dell's summer class at Berkeley ran its second heat
in composition only one "paper was handed in, and
the writer who ventured to offer that removed from
it all identifying marks of sex and name, as unlawful
hunters of deer do from the hides which they barter
for tobacco at the racket store. We assume that the
Harvard purpose was accomplished, the same being
to discourage composition. ; Â¦
If the students in Professor Wendell's class had
been perfect they would not have been there. They
would have been elsewhere, perhaps doing a summer
school stunt themselves. The defects discovered by
the professor's keen Harvard nose were evidence that
their invalid English required his professional ser
vices. As a literary and critical evangelist he is sup
posed not to bring medicine to the well, but to them
that be sick.
The summer students at Berkeley who are getting
filled with English and courtesy and the teaching tem
per at the fountain of Harvard made the radical mis
take of failing to read up on Harvard English. Had
the3' done so and used the forms familiar to Professor
Wendel^they would not now sit with tongues mute
and pens smitten with paralysis in the presence of his
famous garbage expression. Harvard has and has
had many professors^ and they have published many
books, some of them the most charming in American
literature. The contemporaries of Professor Wendell
are not publishing so much, but the soul that thirsts
go seek it as eagerly as the hart panteth for the
water brook. One of Professor ' Wendell's most
noted colleagues in the Harvard faculty is Professor
William James, whose specialty is psychology. He is
familiar with the spirit, the soul df man, and writes
about it as others do of beans or putty. He can
sit down and whittle with the soul as neighbors do
when they meet at the country store to talk about the
crops.

It is believed by the projectors that when completed
the southern line would be much; more satisfactory to.
travelers than the Siberian road, and that it would get
the bulk of the railway traffic aci*oss Asia. That view
seems to have been taken by the Russians themselves, .
for as soon as the, Germans obtained the concession '
for the line to the Persian Gulf the Czar entered into :
'a treaty with the Persian Government which virtually
gives Russia control over that country. â¢ Consequently,
any attempt to extend the line beyond El Kuweit will;
doubtless be met by determined Russian opposition.
That such antagonism will be difficult to overcome
goes without saying. The Germans, howeverj area;
strong and resourceful people, and may yet accom
plish their purpose. If so, the traveler across Asia,
instead of having to pass the dreary barrennesses of
Siberia, will be able to traverse the thickly populated
and renowned countries with which history, religion '
and literature have so many associations.

"I learned a trick while in the Philip
pines" in the matter of keeping blrd^ out
of fruit . tree,s," volunteered i a well-known
official of the Postoffice Department to a
Washington Star reporter, "which may "be
of value to many just now, when so many
cherries are being destroyed by birds. It
is simple, inexpensive 'and, as far as I
could obfserve, practical. It consists in
hanging a small mirror on the top limbs
of the tree. There should be at least six
Inches of string to, the 1 mirror, so that it
can swing about as it Is blown by the
wind. The flash of the mirror it appears
scares the birds away. 'One or two 5-cent
mirrors hung -on . a tree is sufficient,
though, of course, three or four would be
that. much better. I. wasN told that this
method had been worked in the Philip
nines successfully for many years,- and
that the birds do not grow familiar with
it as they do with a scarecrow. Since my
re'turn here I find that the mirror scare is
not unknown; here and that it has been in
use by Michigan fruit growers for many
years. I have tried' it myself in a small
way,- arid it is: amusing, what a stir it
creates among the birds." .

Mrs. Cordelia Botkin was present In

when Attorney Charles J. Heggerty, her
counsel, commenced the legal battle to
prevent her second trial on the charge of
murder by applying: for a writ of habeas

plication was in the terms and on the
grounds published exclusively in Sun

State has no jurisdiction to try the case.
The petition :? eimllar to the one filed by
Louis P. Boardman, who formerly ap
peared in the case and made the point
that it was out of the Jurisdiction of the

an opportunity to prepare his return to
the application, which was granted. The
return will be in effect that the Supreme

Steamship John S. Kimball.
The Dollar Steamship Company s John
S. Kimball is expected here from Nome
to-morrow night or Thursday morning.
In a letter to a friend dated Dutch Har
bor Captain Thwing says that everything
ran like clockwork aboard and that while
the passengers on all the other steamers
were kicking there was not a growl from
the time his vessel left San Francisco un
til the last man was on the Nome beach.
Nearly every berth on the steamship was
taken for the return trip in the fall be
fore the Kimball sailed for San Francisco.
Captain Thwing says that Chief Steward
Crane of the Kimball received a testimo
nial from the passengers on the up trip.
The Kimball will probably bring particu
lars of many things that have happened
at the gold fields of late. She will sail
again for the frozen north next Saturday
night.
Gasoline Boats for South Seas.
.Gasoline as a steam producing power
for boats has grown rapidly in favor in

on the next Australian steamer. - One is
for the Auckland, New Zealand, Harbor
Board and the other is for â¢ a schooner
that is to run between Wellington, New
Zealand, and Cook Island. Both are
eighty-five horsepower machines and are
expected to drive the boats they are in
tended for at a ten-knot clip.
A small engine for Sydney, N. S. W.,
tsJII also go away on the next mail boat
and several others are in course of con
struction, but cannot be completed be
cause of the strike.
Panama Railroad Company's Steam
ship Gets Away for Central

SAILING OF THE LEHANAW.
A CABLE from Hamburg to the
Merchants' Exchange states that
the Kosmos liner Tanis Is a total
loss on Punta Nogotes, South
America. The captain, crew and
passengers were saved and are . probably
now at Montevideo. Later advices state
that a wrecking- steamer has been sent to
Punta Nogotes and that the salvers are
in charge of the wreck.
The Tanis was the first of the Krtsmos
fleet to come to this coast. She arrived
here in December, 1699, and this was her
third round trip. All the steamships sail
from Hamburg and after short stops at
Antwerp and London go direct to South
America. Passing through the Straits of
Magellan, they stop at nearly all the
South and Central American and Mexican
ports, finally reaching San Francisco aft
er nearly four months of almost contin
uous steaming.
The Tanis left here May 2 with a num
ber of passengers and a cargo valued at
$100,000. All the passengers and all the
freight was landed before the steamship
reached Valparaiso, but other merchan
dise and other travelers were taken on at
South American ports. The steamship
passed through the Straits of Magellan
without mishap and was making- for
Montevideo when she ran ashore. The
general supposition is that Captain May
passed Cape Corrientes and mistook it for
Cape San Antonio. He then set his course
for Montevideo and ran on Point No
gotes, a spot between Capes Corrientes
and San Antonio and about 120 miles south
of Montevideo.
The Tanis was built at Hamburg in 1891.
She was 1S21 tons net burden, 331 feet 4
inches lor.g. 41 feet 9 inches beam and 23
feet 5 inches deep. This was Captain
May's first voyage to this coast. When
the Tanis first came here Captain Schultze"
was in command. The loss of the steam
ship will not affect the service in any
way. The Anubis on her arrival here in
a few days will not go to Puget Sound,
but will take all her cargo here. The
Neko. due next month, may go to Seattle,
but the matter is not settled. The Her
monthis. now on the Sound, will call here
to complete her cargo.

APPOINTS A GUARDIAN
FOR GEORGE M. FRANKS
Judge Dunne Authorizes James Wain -
Â¦wright to Care for Property
of Insane Man.
,An order was made yesterday by Su
perior Judge Dunne appointing James
Wainwright guardian of the estate of
George' M. Franks, who was adjudged in
sane last Wednesday and committed to
the Agnews Insane Asylum. Franks was
a member of the firm of Fannin & Franks,
manufacturing agents, with offices in the
Phelan building. The firm was well-to
do arid Franks was happily married to
Wainwright's daughter.
Last week he developed peculiar hallu
cinations. He believed himself extremely
wealthy and about to undertake a tour
of the world; he had signified his inten
tion of giving 100 -newsboys an automobile
ride around the park; he forgot that he
was married and declared that he was en
gaged to a beautiful young lady with a
large bank account, and persisted in this
last assertion, despite the fact that his
wife sat by his side.
After an examination the Insanity Com
mission adjudged him to be insane and
ordered him committed to Agnews.
Franks' interest in the firm named, which
is now in the charge of his father-in-law,
is valued at several thousand dollars.

52.407.SG0 for solvent credits was denied.
Attorney "U\ S. Goodfellow contended that
the deposits should be set off against the
solvent credits. He advised George
To-arny, secretary of the society, not to
answer a Question as to the amount of
solvent credit? secured by mortgages out
side of the State. Goodfellow claimed
there was no warrant in law for collec
tion of taxes on deposits. The application
of the Hibernia Savings and Loan So
ciety for cancellation of a 5275,000 assess
ment was a!so denied.
German Bank's Petition Denied.
Valuation Based on. Income.
'The gross receipts of the company for
lnOl," said Dodge, "were $1.273,4S2. figuring
Â£3.583 telephones at $34 each. Its officials
have refused to file a sworn statement of
its revenue, claiming: that the home office
is in Oregon."
McCarthy made a motion that the as
sessment be raised by SSOO.OOO. but with
drew it when Dodgre explained that to
raise it would invalidate the whole as
sessment, as r.o legal notice ccnild be
given the company.
The petition of the Alaska Packers' As
sociation to be allowed to pay 53900 in full
eatisfacticn of its taxes of 1J*CÂ«O was grant
ed. This amount is based on a franchise
assessment of $200,000, together with a 20
per cent penalty. Assessor Dodge ex
plained that last year's assessment was
JSOu.OOO. and the city was awarded a judg
ment by Judg-e Hebbard for the tax on
5200.000. at which the assessment has been
fixed for 1901. The compromise was ac
cepted on the recommendation of the As
sessor, it being the sense of the board
that it was undesirable to drive capital
away from the city by onerous assess
ments.
Assessor Dodge explained the process by
"n hich he had arrived at the telephone as
sessment. By means of a chart he showed
that the net profits of the company in 1901
vere $356..Â»4. which makes the value of
its plant, figuring on a C per cent basis,
Â£5.942.916, whereas the total assessment,
including real estate, was only J3.129,Cl)0.
Dodge sa.Id there might be reason to
raise the assessment, but there was no
excuse fcr lowering it.
Just before the board adjourned the
telephone company filed an application
'or reduction of the arbitrary assessment
of its franchise by the Assessor from
$1,500,000 to $300,000. The company claims
that the valuation of the franchise at the
first named figure Is greater in proportion
than- that of other property and \ras
made arbitrarily and not in pursuance of
any definite rule or principle of apprise
menL
The most Important act of the board
Â¦was the denial of the petition of the Pa
cific States Telephone and Telegraph
Company for a reduction in its assess
ment.
The Supervisors. Bitting as a Board of
Equalisation, concluded the hearing of
applications for the reduction of assess
ments yesterday and adopted a resolution
approving: the list of corrections on the
assessment role reported by Assessor
Dodge.
Compromise Effected With
the Alaska Packers'
Association.

LOS ANGELES. July 15.â The Los An
geles Traction Company Is still after those
of its employes who recently joined a la
bor union. The management of the com
pany has become convinced that altogeth
er fifty of its conductors . and motormen
had decided to cast their lot with the
union, which, as a matter of fact, was
never really organized. Each of these men
has been under surveillance, and all would
have been summarily dismissed but for
the fact that fcuch a wholesale decapita
tion might have crippled the system. The
suspected ringleaders were therefore first
picked out for removal. One of the dis
charged men said to-day that the com
pany had dismissed altogether twenty
three men. nearly all of them among the
oldest In point of service on the system
New men are being constantly taken on
President Powers of the City Council
was asked to use his influence and have
the discharged men reinstated, and he
took up the matter with the owners of
the road. That was in the early stages
of the trouble. Councilman Powers was
told that his request would be given con
sideration, and that is the last he has
heard of it. Superintendent of Streets
Hugh McGuire. who Is an old traction
man, also sought to use his good offices
for the discharged men, and his efforts
met a similar failure.

LONDON, Julv 16.â In the House of

dren. He said also that the mortality for
the month of June was 63 men, 138 women
and 276 children.
Lord Raglan deplored the heavy mor

result cf the Leipzeiger Bank collapse.
The Gera worsted spinnery failed to-dny

The Cologne Gazette prints a very pessi
mistic t-eport as to the iron market.
"Although the market is more quiet,"
it says, "the outlook is discouraging, ow
ing to the accumulation of stocks at the
works. Confidence in an early improve
ment of conditions is waning."
It mentions numbers of insolvencies and
refers to arrangements by many smailer
dealers with their creditors.
"Throughout the entire domestic mar
ket," continues the Cologne Gazette,
'.'there is a renewed indisposition to place
orders. Only those absolutely necessary
&re given. The larger works, therefore, are
beginning to hunt more eagerly for orders,
which causes decline in price and leads
also to keener competition for foreign
orders. A remedy for the present situa
tion cannot be expected until the market
has digested the old high-priced con
tracts."
This Journal recommends that the Gov
ernment should Issue immediate orders
for the construction of all necessary
freight cars, in order to create employ
ment for those out of work.

SINKS TO DEATH
IN LAKE TAHOE
Thunder Showers and Lower Tem
peratures Are Forecasted in
Several Sections.
"WASHINGTON, July 15.â Relief for the
heat-stricken district of the corn belt Is
predicted by the weather bureau to-night.
No general rains are apparently yet in
sight, but thunder showers, with conse
quent lower temperatures, are probable in
Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Illi
nois and possibly Indiana. There is a
prospect of a continuance of these show
ers Wednesday in the Ohio and Mississippi
valleys and in the upper lake regions,
bringing cooler weather for the time
being.
To-day the hot weather continued
thr3Ughout the corn- belt and over the
lower lake region ajid upper Ohio Valley,
but temperatures fell considerably during
the early evening over the latter district
under the influence of local thunder
storms. Thunder-storms also occurred in
South Dakota, Northern Illinois, portions
of Ohio. Missouri and Arkansas and af
forded some relief from the heat.
RELIEF PREDICTED
IN HOT WAVE DISTRICTS
Many witnesses are to be examined and
it is exsected that several days will be
occupied with the hearing. i
The following is a list of the children
now In the care of the Biters, all of whom
were in court to-day: Nellie Allen, 14
ytars; Mary Sousa, 12 years; Myrtle
Sousa, 12 years; Agnes O. Heon, 10 years;
Richard Rowe, 12 years; Freddy Fonso,
9 years; Enoch C. Allen, 9 years; Eugene
Buyers, 5 years; Benjamin F. Biter, 5
yems; Hazel Adams. 5 years; Violet
O'Herne, 4 years; Louise Baltimore (col
ored). 4 years; Mary Adams, 3 years;
Harry Ca'.so known as Harry Biter), 3
ytars; John , 3 years; Roy Matson, 2
years; Julia Seibold, 14 months.
But little interest is taken in the case
here, as it is looked upon as a battle be
tween two rival societies for the protec
tion of children.
The answer filed by Montieth was some
what sensational. It alleges the exist
ence of a conspiracy to destroy the home
and happiness of the respondents.' It was
charged that on July 6 the Biter home
was assailed by Secretary White, Consta
ble John Creed and others, who, without
any authority of law, forcefully entered
the premises. When John Biter remon
strated against their actions he was hand
cuffed to an iron pump. The Biters claim
that they are performing a labor of love
in caring for homeless waifs. Many of
their charges come to them from the
Children's Protective Association and
from parents who are unable to give them
proper care. The children, they declare,
are well housed.
SAN RAFAEL, July 15.â The applica
tion of M. J. White, secretary of the San
Francisco Society for the prevention of
Cruelty to Children, for letters of guard
ianship over the seventeen children now
in the custody of John Biter and his wife
at what has been called their "baby
farm," on the Lyford ranch, came up for
hearing before Judge Angellotti this aft
ernoon. Attorney T. J. Crowley appeared
for White and George W. Montieth for

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 15.-Rev. J. Stitt
Wilson of Evanston, 111., delivered a
scathing arraignment of the competitive
system this morning In the First Congre
gational Church. Incidentally, his audi
ence, composed mostly of ministers of va
rious denominations, came In for some de
cidedly pointed suggestions regarding the
incompatibility of the teachings of Christ
and the present industrial system, which
the United States encourages.
Rev. Mr. Wilson attacked present condi
tions from every point of view, alleging:
in forcible and clear Anglo-Saxon that
there was' neither justice, mercy nor
brotherly love in the competitive 'system.
"The present condition of life affairs
leads to the survival of the brute," he de
clared, with vigor. "The product of labor
is the product of God perfected by man.
Under existing circumstances it is under
the possible control not of man in general,
but of one man. The resources of the uni
verse are subject to private ownership,
and while such is the case there can be
no true Christianity."
Rev. Mr. Wilson's efforts were primarily
directed toward showing the relationship
of socialism and Christianity, and, lead
ing to that theme, he laid down the three
fundamental principles of religious ex
istence: First, to establish justice; sec
ond, to show mercy, and third, to firmly
establish the principles of brotherly love.
Rev. Mr. Wilson then took the ground
that no clergyman of to-day could teach
the doctrines of Christ and uphold the
competitive system.
"The present system," said the speaker,
"is a gigantic struggle for existence, with
monopoly on top and humanity beneath.
It Is unchristian and it is the height of
blasphemy to link the name of God with
it."
Some rather wry faces were noticed
among the local clergymen present, as
Mr. Wilson showed an inclination to lead
from the shoulder. He was careful to
avoid a personal arraignment, however,
confining his efforts 'to the. impeachment
of the principle.

ATTACK A RIVAL
TONG'S QUARTERS
Friends of Lee Look Are
Worsted by the Hip
Second Trial of the High
binder Is Commenced
in San Jose. .
â ? Â»
Special" Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE,' July 15.â A war between the
Bing Ong Tong and Hip Sing Tong high
binders, in which the rormer society at
tempted to burn and loot the headquar
ters of the Hip Sings, took place in Hein
lieville Chinatown early this morning. The
two factions have been fighting for some
time, and lately it was said a price had
been placed on the head of two prominent
Hip Sings, because they gave "testimony
against Lee Look at his trial for murder.
Armed with axes and revolvers, a dozen
Bing Ongs stole up to and attacked the
Hip Sings clubhouse, hoping to take it
by storm and obtain an entrance and
murder the inmates before j they were
fairly awake. The Hip Sings were not
caught napping, and their sentry discov
ered the approaching war party.
A flying flag was cut down and the rear
of';the house set on' fire and then the
work of breaking in the door commenced.
The Hip Sings opened fire on the attack
ing party and the volley was returned.
The assailants were finally driven off
after a score of shots had been fired. The
incendiary blaze was extinguished. So
far as known, none of the participants in
the affray were seriously wounded.
Lee Look's Second Trial Begins.
The ' second trial of Lee Look, charged
with the murder of Lee Wing, began in
Judge Eorigan's court to-day, and the
work of selecting a jury occupied the
court's attention. -Owing to the acquittal
of the defendant in the face of seemingly
positive testimony that he committed the
deed and to the fact that it was intimated
that- witnesses had perjured themselves
for the defense, unusual interest centers
in the case and the courtroom -was
crowded.
Senator -Oneal, who appears for Lee
Look, presented an affidavit by himself
asking for a continuance. It set forth
that the defendant could not obtain a fair
and impartial trial in Santa Clara Coun
ty for. at least thirty days, because of. ad
verse public sentiment.. The District At
torney had alleged that at least five of
the witnesses for the defense had com
mitted perjury at the former trial, the :
newspapers had printed these statements
and jurors serving in this case would be
afraid that if they acquitted the defend
ant they would be ridiculed and charged
with bribery and corruption. The motion
was denied.
Eight Jurors Sworn.
The talesmen were carefully examined
by Attorney Oneal. They were asked if
they would give the same credence to tes
timony by Chinese, contradicting that of
the officers who captured Lee Look while
shooting Lee Wing, as to that of the offi
cers, and .whether they would be de
terred from voting to acquit by fear that
the papers would denounce them.
The following were sworn as jurors:
Samuel Hutchins, H. W. Stephens, H. W.
Wilkinson. E. Jacobs, A. R. King, T. O.
Cook. A. J. Landrum and Edwin Howes.
There has been a falling off in the coun
sel for the defendant. Only Oneal ap
peared to-day, and it is rumored that At
torneys Partridge, Jacobs and James have
withdrawn from the case.
GOLDEN CARGOES
ON YUKON BOATS
Shipments From Daw
son to Date Amount
to $5,000,000.
SEATTLE, July 15.â Late advices from
Dawson, under date of June 28, state that
the gold shipments to the outside this
year have amounted to $5,000,000 to date.
More than $3,000,000 of this sum went down
the Yukon and is going out by the way
of St. Michael, and the balance has gone
up the river. V
News has been brought from the mouth
of the Hootalinqua River by steamer that
a placer strike has been made on Lake
Creek, tributary to Lake Teslin, the
source of the Hootalinqua River.
Hams, potatoes and all kinds of fruit
are selling in Dawson at exceedingly low
rates and traders are losing money. Cher
ries, peaches, apples and other fresh
fruits are plentiful.
Wesley Brawdy, aged 22 years, was
swept from a raft on the Yukon River, a
short distance above Dawson, last week
and was drowned. J. W. Lowes, a native
of Toronto and a resident ofiBritish Co
lumbia, was drowned near Big Salmon" a
few days ago. Orin D. Merryman, a na
tive of Marysville, Mo., was accidentally
drowned at Eagle July 2 by the capsizing
of his canoe. â¢
An interesting picture has just been
purchased by King Edward VII. It was
painted by the Empress Frederick, then
Princess Royal, in 1855, to be sold for the
benefit of the widows and orphans of the
soldiers who fell in the Crimea. It is
called "The Battlefield," and was original
ly bought for- 500 guineas, but recently re
verted to a dealer.
CRADDOCK, Cape Colony. July 15.â
Johannes Coetze. caught with Marias, the
Tcbel, who was hanged July 10 at Middle
burg, was publicly executed for treason
in Craddock to-day.
GRAAF REINET, Cape Colony, July
15.â Colonel Scobell's column surprised
and captured Scheeper's laager at Camde
boo on July 14, taking thirty-one prisoners
and capturing a quantity of ammunition
and stores. Scheeper. with the bulk of
his commando, escaped. There were no
British casualties. Most of the prisoners
are rebels.
CAPE TOTVX. July 15.â The Prime Min
ister in addressing the vigilance commit
tee this afternoon replied to the petition
from Graaf Reinet regarding the suspen
sion of the responsible Government. He
maintained that there was no analog'
whatever between the circumstances in
Canada and in Cape Colony. The weak,
vacillating policy of the Imperial Govern
ment twenty years ago brought about the
present position In South Africa. Sir
Bartle Frcre had accepted his (Spriggs')
advice, but unhappily Great Gritain would
:iot listen to Sir Bartle Frere's recom
mendations. In consequence of this events
had occurred whence all the present trou
bles arose. Spriggs said he was entirely
satisfied eo long as Lord Salisbury re
mained in power there would be
no shadow or anything in the na
ture of going: back. He depre
cated the suspension of the respon
sible Government, as it might possibly
cause changes in the position of the Brit
ish political parties. The Cape Govern
ment entirely sympathized with the an
nounced policy of the Imperial Govern
ment. The Cape Cabinet had been ren
dering all possible support to the Imperial
Government and Intended to continue its
support with the full assurance that the
Imperial authorities would not vary their
policy, which he understood was to wipe
out the last vestige of republicanism in
South Africa. (Cheers.) Spriggs ex
pressed the opinion that the aspect of af
fairs was more nopeful to-day than at
any time since the outbreak of hostilities.

BOER TROUBLE
UNDER REVIEW
CALL. BUREAU. 1406 O STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON. July 15.âCon
gress may be called upon next winter to
strtl further scale down the war revenue
taxes. The officials of the Treasury De
partment are surprised by the unexpect
edly large receipts for the first half of
the first month of the new fiscal year as
compared with the same period last year.
The total receipts for the first fifteen
days of July foot up $25,784 094 35. against
$23,043,155 38 for last year. Of the receipts
this month $9,807,243 77 are from the cus
toms, against $8,824,396 91 last year, and
$14. 972,698 44 from the internal revenue,
against $13,327,665 12 last year, and this
Increase in the internal revenue is in spite
of going into effect on July 1 of the rev
enue reduction law, which was expected
to cut down the internal revenue about
$40,000,000 per year. There has been an
increase in expenditures over last year
of about $2,000,000. but the current deficit
of $4,295,505 65 is about $1,700,000 less than
the deficit for the first fifteen days of last
July. July and August of this year were
both expected to show larger deficits than
the first two months of last year, but the
present prospects are that they will not
be much larger, and that the surplus at
the end of the year will be almost if not
fully up to the surplus at the end of the
last fiscal year, notwithstandins the In
creased expenditures and reduction of
taxation. This will largely depend, how
ever' on the reneral prosperity of the
country during the next eleven and a half
months.

ONLY A BYWORD
The whitecappers were sentenced to the
penitentiary, but after a long^flght in the
courts their penalty was reduced to one
year in jail. It was while they were serv
ing these sentences last year that Baker
is accused of virtually granting them
their freedom. The outrage committed on
Gifford occurred In July, 189S. He was at
that time- a poor prospector seeking min
eral in the hills of Laluse Canyon, New
Mexico. The disappearance of Colonel A.
J. Fountain, the mystery of which has
never yet been solved, had stirred that
section of the co.untry until a state of un
usual excitement existed. Lawlessness
was rampant, and every stranger encoun
tered in the hills was suspected of being
a detective working on the Fountain case.
Gifford was a peaceful prospector, but he
was unknown and had been warned to
quit the country. He paid no attention to
the notice, and at midnight eight white
caps dragged him from his tent and bru
tally beat him. Then they poured tar over
him from his head to his feet and left
with a warning for him to depart within
twenty-four hours. He left, but was able
to identify five of his assailants. Four
were convicted, but the fifth man died
while under indictment.
EL PASO, Tex., July 15.-Ex-Sheriff W.
R. Baker of Otero County, New Mexico,
was arraigned before the United States
Commissioner here to-day on the charge
of violation of the statute by extending
too many privileges to four prisoners who
were sentenced to serve one year each in
the jail at Alamogordo for whitecapping
A. "W. GIfford, a wealthy mining man of
El Paso. The prisoners, Gilliland, Haynes,
Johnson and Counts, were found guilty
three years ago of taking Gifford from
his tent at midnight, administering fifty
lashes with a rawhide whip on his bare
back, treating him to a coat of tar and
ordering him to leave the' country within
twenty-four hours.

Millions of little glands or tubes connect the blood with the skin, and through
these small drain pipes perspiration passes out, carrying with it the impurities that
are thrown off by the blood. Should the pores of the skin be entirely closed for
even a brief space of time, and the poisonous matter forced back into the circula-
tion, instant death would result. In addition to the sweat glands, the skin is
provided with certain others which pour out upon it an oily substance, keeping
the skin pliable and soft and protecting it from heat and cold. The blood and skin
are so closely related that whatever affects one seriously interferes with the tunc-
tions of the other. Not only health, but life itself, depends upon perfect harmony
between the blood and skin. When, therefore, the â-.# -Â¦Â¦â¢â¢I
blood becomes poisoned from any cause, it quickly intBMSii SUtU
manifests itself upon the skin in the form . **** S **'** â^
of sores and ulcers, pimples and; various rOMSOnS
eruptive diseases. , By the character of the # ' '.,...,
sore we are enabled to determine the nature of the poison or humor in the Dlooci,
as every disease originating in the blood has its own peculiar sore or pimple. The
skin is not only affected by. the poisons generated in the system, but poisons from
without enter through the open glands or pores and quickly infect the blood.
Mercury rubbed upon the skin will produce Rheumatism, and Poison Oak and Ivy
and other wild plants gain easy access to the blood through the skin. As so-called
â¢ skin diseases originate in the blood,' the application

of the skin. The treatment must begin with the blood, and the acid or other pois-
ons antidoted or neutralized. S. S. S. does this and purifies the circulation, builds
up the blood. and flushes the little glands or pores with pure, new blood, and
restores healthy action to the skin. - The use of cosmetics never yet brought health
and beauty to a rough, red, pimply skin or sallow complexion. What is needed
is rich, pure blood, such as S. S. S. makes. It not only relieves you of all disfigur-
ino- blackheads, blotches and irritating, itching eruptions, but improves your general
health. S. S. S. contains no mercuiy, potash, arsenic or other mineral,. but is a
purely vegetable remedy and the safest and best. in all blood and skin troubles.

McHaney gave himself up and was taken

vicinity of the lakes is very bitter. For
several years there has been friction be
tween the citizens of Delta County and
the Game Wardens, who were stationed
at the lakes to prevent the public from
fishing- there. The citizens claim that tho
lakes are public waters and were stocked,
with fish when ' the Indians were here.
William Radcliffe. on the other hand,
claims exclusive fishing privileges on ac
count of stocking the lakes and by virÂ»

youâ extending to you the freedom of our city,

society than is usually cultivated; men and
minds should l>e brought more together in so
cial contact, which uuder favorable conditions
would aid to mold mutual interests, and 'per
haps be the means of making them better men
and brighter members of society. And therein
we are taught to acquire each other's aid and
sympathy, that we must wear around us the
ir-antle of common friendship if we wish to
succeed in life; alone we cannot succeed; to
gether we can create a bond of feeling that
will stem the tide of selflsh desire and guide
us Into those channels of friendship that will
strengthen as the current of life rolls on.

Notes of the Camp.
The first sergeants of the regiment will
give a dance at the Pavilion to-morrow
night. The boys are making great prepar
ations for this affair.
Company D, under command of Captain
Frank McCarthy, gave an exhibition drill.
These lads marched like veterans and
their maneuvers, faultlessly carried out,
aroused enthusiasm. The League of the
Cross Band, under the direction of Cap
tain Putzer, played a number of stirring
marches and waltz music for those who
indulged in the light fantastic. Dancing
was kept up until taps, when the cadets
reluctantly returned to camp to discuss
the success of the reception. Although
tired from their day's pleasure, the lads
skylarked and kept their neighbors awake.
The guardhouse as usual became crowded
with revelers and belated soldiers. As a
ic-sult there will be clean streets In camp
to-morrow.
A pretty and patriotic ceremony each night

SAN LUIS OBISPO, July 15.â William
Kelsoe, the supposed murderer of Harry
E. Blochman at Santa Maria on July 3,
was captured last night by Sheriffs Ivans
of San Luis Obispo County and Stewart
of Santa Barbara County. The informa
tion leading to his apprehension was given
by J. H. Henry, on whose ranch, near
Templeton, Kelsoe had been working for
a week past.
Kelsoe was brought to San Luis Obispo
to-night and lodged in prison. He* admits
that he is the man for whom posses have
been searching for nearly two weeks,
but denies all knowledge of the murder of
young Blochman and even claims that he
never knew any one of that name.
Had Kelsoe been captured a week ago
it is likely that he would have been
lynched, as the sentiment against him
was very strong. Scores of men joined in
the pursuit of the fugitive with . the
avowed intention of stringing him up if
he were caught. Now that the excitement
has subsided somewhat it is believed that
the prisoner is in no danger of mob
violence. No chances will be taken, how
ever, and the jail will be kept well
guarded.
Kelsoe, in giving an account of himself
to-night, said he was in San Luis Obispo
on July 4. He went to work on the Henry
ranch on July 6. giving his name as Wal
ter Jackson. He tried to get his wages
and leave, but was detained until the offi
cers could make the arrest. An officer Is
coming from Santa Barbara, and he will
be taken to that city to-morrow.' Kincaid,

CALL HEADQUARTERS, CAMP
POWER, NAPA, July 15.â The
residents of this county crowded
the pavilion this evening to wit
ness the official welcome to
the first Regiment, League of the Cross
Cadets, which is encamped here. The
hall was beautifully decorated by the citi
zens' committee, and presented a hand
some appearance. The cadets filled the
spacious building and their uniforms of
blufl made a pretty background for the
white gowns of the fair sex.
Rev. Father Slattery, pastor of St.
John's Church of this city, acted as presi
dent of the evening. In a few words the
pastor introduced "Uncle Jack" Fuller,
Mayor of Napa, and one of the most popu
lar men in the valley. The Mayor was
given an ovation and when the applause
had ceased spoke in part as follows:
Of the many pleasant duties that have de
volved upon me I cannot recall one that has
given me as much satisfaction and pleasure
as that assigned to me this evening, of ex
tending to the League of the Cross Cadets a
welcome to the beautiful city of Napa. Not
A sugar ship came up to the dock at
Crockett this morning, but on account of
the strike- she was unable to discharge,
and she returned to San Francisco upon
telephone order to discharge at that port.
The, strike was entirely orderly. The
men, having formulated their demands,
which were not conceded, refused to go to
work this morning. There was no dis
turbance, and although a number of peace
officers were on hand their services were
not required. The strike will be a serious
inconvenience to shippers, as the sidings
are full of freight cars laden with wheat
ready for the warehouses. At present
ships are scarce, and vast quantities of
grain is being housed in readiness for
shipment as soon as charters can be-pro
cured. Since the trouble at Stockton has
been adjusted an accumulation of wheat
at that point has been rushed In here.
Much of it still remains on the cars, and
it is impossible to say when it can be
handled, as the men have a very strong
organization, and the situation Is such
that it is extremely difficult to get outside
help.
The railroad yards are full of cars, and
a congested condition will result if a set
tlement is not reached in a few days. The
â¢warehousemen refuse to listen to any
overtures unless nine hours are conceded
and time and one-half is paid for over
time.
MARTINEZ, July 15.â The freight hand
lers at Carquinez Straits, from the Neva
da docks down, including those at Mc-
Nears and Crockett, went on strike this
morning, which will involve from 300 to
400 men. The warehousemen endeavored
to get the weighers to do some work, but
they also refused out of sympathy for the
general freight handlers. As a result
everything in the shipping line Is at a
standstill.
The ships Wadsbeck and Chipperdyke
are here loading. An attempt was made
to have the sailors on board truck wheat
to the stevedores. The stevedores refused
to receive the wheat and quit work.
At Balfour A Guthrie's warehouse one
man was induced to go to work at 8
o'clock. He was later escorted to the Ala
meda County iire.
The sugar company on Saturday called
all of its dockmen to the office and gave
them their discbarge. A great many were
old employes and non-union men. No ex
planation was given except that the ac
tion was taken en orders from headquar
ters.
CROCKETT. July 13.â The strike . of
freight handler? went into effect a.t 9
o'clock this morning, Eppinger & Co.'s
men being the* first to walk out. Every
man employed in the warehouses between
here and Martinez is out. There have
been no disturbances of any kind. The
California and Hawaiian Sugar Company
attempted to induce the men from the
refinery to work in the warehouses, but
they refused, and were discharged in con
sequence. Even the boys were discharged
for refusing to truck sugar.
Dock Superintendent Prank Sherman
and two foremen, unable to engage n-en,
finally doffed their coats and went at
trucking themselves.

SAN MATEO TO EXACT
REVENUE OF CHINESE
Mrs. Navaret had run for assistance
when the shooting began. When the po
lice arrived they found Johnson dying. He
and the girl were taken to the Receiving
Hospital. Johnson never recovered con
sciousness. The girl's wounds were dress
ed. They are in the back of the head and
are net serious. She showed remarkable
r.erve. and, having been treated, walked
about the apartment, relating the story
of the tragedy. The bullets, which are 35
caliber. have not been removed from the
girl's head, but this probably will be done
to-morrow.
Little is known of Johnson here. He
v.as 24 years old and a native of Sweden.
The Xavaret family has not the best of
reputation. A few years ago the girl's
father, John Navaret, was shot in the leg
while caught in the act of stealing hay,
and he has served several terms in the
County_JaiL
Louisa then struggled to her feet and
Johnson caught her as she was leaving
the room. The girl tore away from him
and ran out on the front porch, where
she fell. Johnson then shot himself in
the head.
Louisa Navaret at this time was seated
in a rocking- chair crocheting and John
sen was only a few feet away. He at
once began shooting. The first two bul
lets missed the girl and lodged in the
wall. The third struck her in the back
of the head. She fell and then arose.
Johnson fired again, this bullet also
striking: her in the head. She was rend
ered unconscious for a few minutes and
when she regained her senses he was i
standing over her. She told him she was
not dead yet and he started to load his
revolver, saying he would kill her and
himself.
Escapes From the Murderer.
Johnson left the house at 8 o'clock this
morning- and went up town. When he re
turned he exhibited a marriage license he
had procured and said a minister would
be at the house at 3:30 o'clock to perform
the ceremony. He said he was "as happy
as a bird," and asked Louisa if she would
marry him. The girl declined to marry
on such ehort notice. She went to dinner,
Johnson declining to eat, and when she
returned to the room he was gone.
Johnson returned at 2 o'clock. He again
asked her to marry him and on her re
fusal he remarked that he had something j
for her, whereupon he produced a revolver
he had purchased. He declared he would
kill her and himself unless she complied,
and the girl told him he was giving: her
"hot air."
Procures a Marriage License.
Johnson came up from Redwood City,
where he is employed, on Saturday even
ing. Last night he stopped at the girl's |
house. He told Mrs. Navaret yesterday
that he wanted to marry Louisa and that {
if she refused him, no one else should have
her. He would kill her and then him
self. This was regarded as an idle threat.
For more than a year Johnson and :
Louisa Navaret had been lovers and i
shortly after their -first meeting she had !
promised to marry him. Several times i
the date was set, but she postponed the i
marriage. As many times he had threat
ened to kill her if she trifled with him.
and to-day he tried to execute these
threats. '
That murder was not added to the act i
of suicide vras no fault of Johnson, for j
he stood but a yard away from his sweet- i
heart and fired four shots at her. Two of I
the bullets entered her head, but the {
wounds are not fatal. Then Johnson I
turned the revolver on himself and fired j
a bullet into his head, dying at the Re- i
reiving Hospital an hour later.
SAX JOSE. July 15.â Jealousy and mad
infatuation turned what might have been
the sre-e of wedding cheer and tinkling
weeding bells Into a chamber of tragedy
at the home of Mrs. John Xavaret. 146
North River street, this afternoon. The
principals Charles J. Johnson, a
lineman employed at the electrical works
in Redwood City, and Louisa Navaret, a
rather pretty French girl of 19 years. It
was the old story of a love-crazed man
and a postponing maid.

NEW YORK. July 15.â To-day's stock mar
ket was a striking Illustration of a favorite
Wall street aphorism that the expected never
happens. The general expectation in Wall
etreet this morning was of a day of continued
liquidation and violent declines In prices. As
a matter of fact, the first smashing blow dealt
to the market by the accumulation of. selling
orders over Sunday, which were executed al
most simultaneously when the president's gavel
fell, made the low prices of the day. There
was a gradual but continued recuperation dur
ing the whole of the remainder of the day, ex
cept for some fresh recessions at the close,
â¢when the room traders were taking their prof
it* on the day's rally. A scrutiny of the day's
net changes reveals some considerable net
losses, but also several eharp net gains, while
the sharpest losses at the opening were re
duced to -unimportant proportions or entirely
wiped out. The natural inference from tbeso
event* Is that a considerable portion of the
celling was necessitated by the unfavorable
development of the labor situation in the steel
trade, while reassuring opinions were being
doled out to the public of the extreme improb
ability of the dispute reaching the open issue
of a strike. But the unir.lUa.ted outsiders with
United States Steel holdings undisposed made
a notable demonstration this morning In their
urgent attempt- to unload, only to find that
the Insiders were prepared to support the mar
ket and accept their offerings. A considerable
part of the liquidation In the Eteel stocks came
from London, where, in fact, declines below
Saturday's New York parity of 4% for United
States Bteel common and 6 for United States
Steel preferred had been recorded before tho
opening here. The New York prices did not get
as low as those for London, but the extreme
opening decline for the common was 4% on run
ning sales of 20,000 shares and of the preferred
6 points. Speculative Wall street showed ex
treme alarm over, the violent slump in the steel
stocks and eaw visions of catastrophe. It soon
became evident, however, that whatever prepa
rations had been necessary to enable the friends
of the United States 6teel stocks to withstand
the pressure upon them was made last week
The relief afforded by last week's liquidation
Tvas aa Important factor in to-day's resiliency
of all Btoeks. The large portion of the cash
received from the Interior last week by the
basks is reported to have been for the purpose
of restoring Impaired margins on stocks. In
this connection It Is worthy of note that the
Chicago premium on New York Exchange fell
from 25 cents last week to 5 cents to-day The
rally in the market was very feverish and er
ratic until the opening prices In the corn mar
ket disclosed new weakness of that cereal on
the prospects of rain in the corn belt. Tho
continued weakness of corn was an influential
factor in the restrained recovery of stocks The
opening declines In the leading grangers' and
Pacifio Southwestern* reached from 3 to 6
points. Union Pacific leading. Elsewhere in
tfc* list the losses ran variously from 1 to 4
jwiints. The recovery in the United States Steel
waÂ« not so sustained as elsewhere, the com.

The railroad bond market was not so acutely
affected as stocks and showed come gains In

Chicago reported a purely weather market,
which was extremely unsettled. Clouds and
traces of rain at different points in the South
west and Northwest indicated a possible
change in the weather, but the weather bureau
could see no probable change except possible
showers in the Missouri Valley. It was slight
ly cooler In the Northwest. Some advices from
South Dakota reported a damage of 25 per cent
there from dry weather. Signs of rain at Chi
cago made that market bearish. The American
visible supply decreased 1,710,000 bushels, bul

CHICAGO, July 15.â An active demand for
wheat at the opening was caused by bullish
statistics and a sharp advance at Minneapolis,
presumably reflecting unfavorable climatic
conditions. The starting 1 price, 68@68%c for
September, proved the best of the day, how
ever, for Minneapolis lost its final advance.
Showers were predicted and a concerted ef
fort to minimize any damage was made by
various Interests. Under liquidation Septem
ber gradually worked off to 6G%c, reaching this
point near the end of tho session and -.closing
rather heavy, %c lower at 66%@66%c
Corn was purchased freely at the start, Sep
tember opening from 51c to 62c. This was due
to belief in the direful effects of the hot spell
and the strength was straightway dissipated
by reports of moderating temperatures, scat
ered showers and promising clouds over parts
of the corn belt. September, under active sell
ing, declined to 49>,ic and closed weak, 74c
lower, at 49%c *
There was a heavy trade in oats, and while
that market exhibited evidences of (sympathy
with corn, prices held better than in the corn
pit, owing to a good country demand. Sep
tember closed steady, %c lower, at 30%@30%c.
Provisions opened weak on the break in steel
stocks, and because of a heavy run of Jiogs. The
market thereafter ruled dull, but steady, as
there was little selling pressure. September

NEW YORK, July 15.â Tho Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: The
markets were disorganized all around and busi
ness was small, but all were sellers qf stocks.
Consols were again pressed for sale on account
of the weakness in Americans, touching 91 1-16,
the lowest since 1875, when 3 per cents were
quoted at 91%. In the afternoon there was a re
covery to 91%. Another depressing Influence
was the action of the Brighton Railway In
declaring a dividend of 2%. as against 3^4. This
is the first of the British railways to take such
a stand, and is regarded as a criterion of what
may follow with other companies.
The stock market was .very sick. American
shares were demoralized and spasmodic. They
opened flat and grew worse, until New York
opened equally disheartened. At the end there
was a rally of two points in the case of Union
Pacific, Atchison and other leaders. Ther* is
some difficulty In carrying, the general rata
being EH per cent, the home Issues paying IVt.
The chief Uature was United States Steel
Corporation, in which many traders were re
fused dettlement facilities. Others had to re
duce.the commitments by half. There is vaguÂ»
talk of trouble. Steel common sold down to 36
and closed at 39&, the preferred touching 88%
and closing at 90%. The rally was due to a
message said to be from Mr. Morgan that a set
tlement of the strike was hoped for In forty
eicht hours.
: Money is scarce, the market being unable to
repay the half-million due to the bank and
borrowing a million besides.

The market yesterday was unusually quiet
and featureless. Receipts were generally light
and prices showed little change. Grapes from
Yuma arrived in bad condition, and had to go
lower. Good large Apricots, for canning ac
count, were firm at full figures. Peaches and
Plums held their previous good prices and sold
off well. Plums are doing extra well this year.
Local dealers account for this by the fact that
the fruit i3 bringing such good prices In the
East that a good deal of It is going that way.
The market is practically bare of Mexican
Limes, and no more are expected until the
last of the week. Lemons are also in moderate
supply and Â¦firm.

1118 Broadway, July 15.
Residents of Upper Fruitvale crowded
the Supervisors* room to-day to protest
against the granting of licenses to the sa
loons and beer gardens, against whose dis
orderly conduct they have long been agi
tating. * :-...'
Citizens of the wealthy suburb appeared:
before the board and described scenes of
revelry and brawling participated in by
both male and female patrons of tha re*
sorts In auestion. V J.* .
Complaints were filed against the places
kept by Charles Tepper, R. E. Taylor ana
Mrs. B. Walliser, and protests were be
fore the board against the renewal of
licenses to Peter C. Nielsen and I_ Faure.
the latter the proprietor of the notorious
Hermitage.
Rev. F. B. Rhoda conducted the prose-*
cutlon against Nielsen and Faure, who
were defended by M. C. Chapman. In thd
fight against the other three places Snook
& Church appeared for the- protestants
and A. I* Frlck for the accused. Frlck
later withdrew because the board would
not order the cases continued on account
of non-compliance with the legal allow*
ance of time within which to plead.
Lawyers Not Wanted.
Supervisor Mitchell said that lawyers
were not needed there anyhow, as there
was already wrangling enough, and aa
for the time limit the board was compe
tent to go ahead with an Investigation
one time as well as another. Frlck re
torted that he was not there to wrangle
but for the protection of his clients' in*
terests.
The board proceeded with the Faure
and Nielsen cases first. Chapman asked
that the charges be dismissed, as they
were not regularly filed and contained no
specific complaints. From the worfflngf of
the protests, he said, it might bÂ« seen
that the residents wers objecting to all
the saloons In Frultvale, whereas the In
vestigation was directed solely against
his clients. The board refused to dismiss
the case and asked for testimony In sup
port of the protest. Rhoda said he would
put no witnesses on the stand. Chapman
accused the minister of wanting a chance
to heap . abuse on his clients. He again
asked for a dismissal, but the board dlÂ«
rected Mr. Rhoda to proceed.
Rhoda said the protest was based on
two technical pointsâ first, that Faura and
Nielsen signed each other's petitions; sec
ond, that neither presented an affidavit of
good character/ â¢Â¦:.' : - ;r>v-
Supervisor Rowe said that If tho pro*
testants had any testimony to support
their claims they must offer It at once.
Ira L. Aymer was then sworn, and tes
tified that he had heard of: the ill-repute
of the Hermitage as far away as Los An
geles before coming to Oakland. He sala
that hoodlums stood out3lde the place ana
insulted passersby, both ladies and gentle-
Daniel Wilmore testified that -he ha*
seen women coming from the Hermitase*
In an intoxicated condition. He said that
the worst feature of the place was tha
crowd of tough young men and women
who came there from Oakland and San
Francisco. _ . ','. *;' : _ ' Â¦".
Charles Reynolds, an officer In the Sal
vation Army, testified that Faure, hla
wife and his sons were in the habit ot
applying abusive epithets to the army
people during their meetings. . He said
that carriages brought women there at
night. _
His Home Desecrated. v
Superintendent William Rutherforfl oC
the California Cotton Mills said that h#
home in Fruitvale was desecrated by tha
riotous drunkenness of the frequenters or
the resorts under investigation.
"It la a farce," he said, "to come hers
time after time and protest against this
outrage. The Supervisors should long: ago
have compelled the District Attorney
to institute proceedings against -thesej
places."
Mr. Rutherford said that recently ha
had seen fighting going on outside the
Hermitage and told of seeing a man and
woman come from the place too drunk to
For the defense .Chapman offered the
testimony of Constables Jerry Quinlan
â¢and Cramer, Policeman Gardiner, W. S.
Dunleavy" and John Ferren of the Oak
land Transit Company to the effect that
the Hermitage was a quiet and orderly,
place.
The board next took up the complaints
against Mrs. Walllser. Charles Tapper
and R. E. Taylor. After Judge- Frick*3

ed him. The testimony against these>-re
sorts was similar to that in the other
cases. One man said he had seen girl3
standing on-chaira at Tepptr's and kick
ing at hats held for them by their male
companions, the latter shouting "High
er!" He had seen both, boys and girls In
toxicated there, x ,

to-night authorized the City Attorney to
proceed with the appeal of the water-rate

been waged over the question of carrying
the famousycase to the court of last re
sort ever gfnee the present Council was
organized. ' The .opponents of appeal fin
ally gave -way on the ground that the peo

prospect of success. But wh,lle the appeal
was ordered, City Attorney Johnson will
have to take it alone and without help.
An ordinance was passed directing the
City Auditor to pay-the bills of the water
company against the city for the current
year.

Two important steps in the development
of Oakland were taken to-day. The first
move toward the construction of the tun
nel road into Contra Costa County was
made by the Board of Supervisors and
ground was broken for the new postoffice
building.
The tunnel road has long been a cher
ished plan In Oakland. The. greater part
of the road was built as a toll road twen
ty years ago by L. W. Kennedy. The
tunnel was even then started, but- funds
gave out and the road Â¦was never com
pleted. The people of Oakland have been
trying for years to find some means of
finishing the road and diverting into Oak
land some of the trade and travel from
that portion of Contra Costa County. But
the Supervisors always held that they
had no power to construct a tunnel be
tween counties, and private funds could
never be secured.
The people of Oakland went before the
last Legislature and secured the -passage
of an act that would enable the Board3
of Supervisors of Alameda and Contra
Costa counties to complete the tunnel
and build the road.
The first formal step was taken to-day
under the new law when a petition was
presented to the Alameda County Super
visors by citizens of Claremont road dis
trict asking that viewers be appointed to
open the road. The petition was signed
by Daniel McMahon, John Keyes, . W. D.
Pryal, Cafisar Young, L. D. Smith, C. H.
Allison, D. Garmaw, John Schmidt. M. C.
Fahey, A. McMullan. L. Heimbold, J. A.
C. Macdonald and M. M. Dunn.
The Supervisors appointed the following
as viewers, and the completion of the road
will now be hurried: E. C. Prather, J.
F. W. Sohet and Wilbur Walker.
The breaking of ground for the new
Postofnce was not accompanied by any
ceremonies and it was not a very impos
ing beginning. But humble as it was it
means much to Oakland, for inside of a
year and a half this city will have a Fedr
eral building in which to' house Its Post
office Sub-Custom-House and other Fed
eral offices. W. T. S. Hoyt, the Govern
ment Superintendent of Construction, has
arrived and opened offices in Oakland. He
was present this morning when â¢ Maurice
Harty turned the first shovelful of earth
for Contractor Barrett and began work
on the new building:.

OAKLAND, July 15. â The Impression
of Intellectual power and personal
dignity and charm created by the
first appearance of the Rev. H. J.'
Vosburgh before the congregation
of the First Baptist Church yesterday
has generally confirmed the members of
that bo'dy in the hope that Dr. Vosburgh,
whose coming they have long anticipated,
is the right man to fill the vacant pastor
ate of this church.
TWO IMPORTANT
WORKS BEGUN
ROTHESAY, Firth of Clyde, July 15.â
The final racing trial of the two Sham
rocks to-day was over a thirty-six mile
course, from Oraigmore to Skelmorlie,
thence to Tomont-End, off Largs, and
back to the starting point. This course
was sailed twice over. A fresh strong
westerly wind of from thirteen to four
teen knots was blowing. The challenger
had the better of the maneuvering for
position, and led the Shamrock I over the
line by about three lengths. The run to
Skelmorlie was dead down the wind, and
the challenger rapidly increased her lead,
rounding the first mark at Skelmorlie one
minute and fifty-seven seconds ahead of
the Shamrock I. On the broad, easy reach
to Tomont-End the challenger increased
her lead until she was two and one-half
minutes ahead, when she encountered a
softer wind and the ex-challenger closed
up. Turning the Erin, off Tomont-End,
the Shamrock II was one minute and for
ty-three seconds ahead. . -
The boats could have fetched home from
this point, but in order to give, a turn to
windward the Erin steamed away and
laid a new mark off Mount Stewart. The
yachts then beat across, the Firth on
short tacks, the challenger gaining" on
every board. After a four-mile beat the
two boats rounded the Erin, the Sham
rock II two minutes and twenty seconds
ahead of the older boat.
Reaching ten miles up channel the chal
lenger outsailed the older boat, and the
timing of the turn at Inverkeep â¢ Bay
showed a difference of nine minutes in
favor of the Shamrock II.
The boats then reached for Largs, where
the Shamrock II was still nine minutes
ahead of the old boat. During the run
home from Larps the Shamrock I expe
rienced a big fluke and -closed up her.dis
tance, finishing: one and a half minutes
astern of the Shamrock II.
On the last leg the Shamrock I was
helped by a rain squall, which did not
touch the challenger, and enabled the
former challenger to close the separating
gap.
The correct time of the finish is: Sham
rock II. three hours thirty-nine minutes
five seconds: Shamrock I, three hours for
ty minutea forty-five seconds.
The fluke which enabled the ex-chal
lenger to finish so close to the challenger
does not, in the opinion of the experts,
detract in any way from what is- regard
ed as a splendid performance on the part
of the Shamrock II.
: At the conclusion of the trials an Imme
diate start was made toward dismantling
the challenger.. Early to-morrow morn
ing her racing canvas will be packed for
shipment. After this is done her present
spars will be replaced by her ocean rig.
It is believed the challenger may possibly
start for the other side July 22.
She Outsails Shamrock I
Over a Thirty-Six-
Mile Course.
The committee on pulpit supply at the
end of a careful canvass of the available
candidates recommended him unqualified
ly. The minds of the members of the com
mittee were practically made up before
they had seen or heard him. Now that
the eminent clergyman has by his own
presence fulfilled all their, prophecies,
there seems little doubt that he will re
ceive a call from the church.*
Mr. Vosburgh said to-night with regard
to his impression of the field:
"There : can be no question . that this is
an attractive location and that It offers an
opportunity for wide usefulness. I like it,
and the people. Of course. I can hardly
express an opinion as to the outcome of
my stay among them."
A C. P. Baker, a leading member of the
church, said: ,
"It is too early to say anything about a.
call. In our church every member has an
equal voice as to that~. All whom I have
heard express themselves, and they have
been many, have been of the one opinion,
that this is the leader we have been
searching for. We have hoped that it
would be so. The church has awaited his
coining with confidence and expectancy.
He seems* to be the man."

Harry "Westwood Cooper, alias JSrnest
Moore Chadwick. made a motion before
Judge Cook yesterday afternoon to dis
miss the charge of forgery against him for
sendingv a forged telegram to Norine
Schneider, at Crockett, on the gTound that
the sixtyVlays had expired within -which
the defendant was entitled to be tried. He
argued that the time occupied In trying
the case wh<5n the jury disagreed did not
count according to the decision of the Su
preme Court in the recent Begerow case.
The Judge denied the motion, to which
Murphy took an exception, and the case
was continued till Saturday to be set.

OLD-TIME EMPLOYE OF THE SOUTHERN- PACIFIC COMPANY WHO
IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SLATED FOR RETIREMENT FROM SER
VICE BY PRESIDENT CHARLES M. HAYS.
Putnam Bradlee Strong of Kew Tork Is
no longer an officer of the United States
army. Complying with telegraphic in
structions from Secretary Root, Acting
Secretary Sanger yesterday formally ac
cepted his resignation. Captain Strong
was apprised by telegraph of the action
taken and is at liberty to sail to-morrow
on the Nippon Maru, the steamer upon
which, it is reported. Lady Francis Hope
has engaged passage.
The action of the department is the
closing chapter of Captain Strong's mete
oric career in the regular army. The rea
sons which caused Secretary Root to di
rect it are known to Mr. Sanger. Facts
in possessiÂ»n of the department are mea
ger. It is known that late on Saturday
evening Captain Strong tendered his res
ignation to Major General Young, com
manding the Department of California:
that he subsequently made full explana
tion to his superior of the causes which
Induced him to offer It; that these reasons
were telegraphed to Secretary Root at
St Louis, and that finding them satisfac
tory, the Secretary authorized tho accep
tance of the rej^gnation.
As to the re^Gona submitted by Captain
Strong, officials of tho department say
that what they are is pure guesswork.
They are satisfied in their own minds, of
course, that they relate to the escapade in
which Strong is alleged to have been In
volved with Lady Francis Hope, but they
have nothing except newspaper report3
upon which to base this belief.
From what the officials know of; Captain
Strong and his record they are confident
he told the truth. In any event he gavo
reason sufficiently good. The Secretary Is
expected to forward to the department
the telegraphic correspondence he had
with General Young, as it will be neces
sary to complete the departmental record
of Captain Strong's service as an officer
of the army.

ORXENTAL ENCAMPMENT'S
SILVER AKTNIVERSARY
Grand Ball in Celebration at Odd
STEPHEN T. GAGE is to be re
tired. In a few days It is expected
that President Charles M. Hays of
the Southern Pacific Company will
Issue a circular to this effect. It
is understood that in consideration of his
long and valuable services to the great
corporation he will be given a pension,
but hie days of active participation in the
affairs of the railroad are at an end and
the man who, next to the big fourâStan
ford, Kuntington, Crocker and Hopkinsâ
stands pre-eminent as one of the great
factors in the history of the development
of the company that has wielded such a
vast Influence in the development of Cali
fornia, will be relegated to private life
by the ukase of the successor of Hunt
ington.
The time was when Gage was the dic
tator of the political fate of two States,
and- his influence reached from Oregon to
Texas and his power was felt in the halls
cf Congress at -Washington. No man in
the history of the Golden State and its
State sister across the mountains ever
wielded greater power than the jnan who
is about to be retired. Legislators were
his playthings. He made and unmade
Judges. He dictated the names of Con
gressmen and United States Senators.
Tbe Governors of sovereign States were
oft times made by Stephen T. Gage.
Stupendous were the political deals
mao*e by the man who is about to go on
the retired list of the corporation of which
he was once director and assistant to the
president. The personal friend of Leland
Stanford, he built up the greatest politi
cal organization in the history of the
West, and he made his friend first Gover
nor and then United States Senator. But
in doing this he incurred the enmity of
C. P. Huntington, and when Huntington
assumed power he deposed Gage at once.
But Gage was big enough to stand up
against the president of the road, and C.
P. Huntington was compelled to make
friends with the man whom he had fought
*so bitterly, and the "My Dear Stephen"
letters written from New York will al
ways be an important Incident in the ro
irantlc history of the great railroads of
California.
But it would Eeem now as if Gage's time
has finally come, and he can hardly sur
vive the new deals and the new dealers.
Handled Millions of Money.
It Is as the political manager for the
Southern and Central Pacific railroads
that Stephen T. Gage is best known. The
position of nssistant to the president,
which he held for much of his life, was
created to enable him to carry on his po
litical management. How well he did it is
a. matter of open htetory, and for years
Gage was the greatest single factor In the
politics of California and Nevada. How
much money he handled for the two com
panies during his nearly forty years of
service will never be known;" but" It will
reach Into the millions.: And while he has
disbursed hundreds of thousands of dol
lars for which vouchers could not be re
quired and never were required Gage is
to-day a man of modest means. An un
pretentious home In. Oakland and a few
pieces of not very productive realty con
stitute the total of his possessions. While
Gage has been with the Central Pacific
Railroad and its successor, the Southern
Pacific Company, almost forty years. He
first became connected with the Central
Pacific in 1864, when the railroad con
sisted of twenty-eight miles of road from
Sacramento to Newcastle. He was at
that time running a freight train of pack
animals from Placerville, the Hangtown
of those days, to Virginia City. He was
a resident of the latter place when the
Comstock lode was just being opened.
The Central Pacific Railroad was about
to build into Nevada, which was soon to
become a State. Gage had helped organ
ize, the Territory of Nevada and was a
power in the orsranization of the new
State. The railroad had to build across
tho Sagebrush State, and Gage was put
in control of all of the politics in that
section. This he handled with the great
est success until in the 70's, when Ne
vada began to wane in importance, and
he was transferred to California and
given control of the politics of the road
for the State and nation and became as
sistant to the president, Leland Stanford.
He was director of the road for many
years, and was a member of the only
executive 'committee that the road ever
had. composed, of Stanford, Huntington
and Gagre. - â¢ â¢â¢ â
Of late years his connection with the
company has been nominal because of his
age and health.
But while his work as politician is the
most prominent feature of his history,
Gage had some of the most difficult work
connected with the Central Pacific Com
pany to perform. For nearly twenty years
he bought all the coal consumed by: the
locomotives of the company. and in that
time he expended $30,000,000 for this com
modity alone. This was no easy task in
the early days when every pound of coal
burned had to be brought from England
and Australia, before the mines in Wash
ington and British Columbia were opened.
Then coal had to be brought from half
way around the world, and it was Gage
who originated the plan of ships bringing
coal here in lieu of ballast and take Cal
ifornia wheat back. Gage has had as many
as 100 clippers on the high seas at one
time bringing coal to California for. the
railroad and one day forty ships rode, at
anchor in San Francisco Bay with car
goes to be discharged. It is no easy task
to keep a great railroad system supplied
with fuel when It had to be brought from
abroad. Storms may delay vessels and at
one time Gage found himself with scarce
ly three days' supply for the system. But
he was never caught.
. Few know this phase of the remarkable
life and character of this man. Those who
knew him as a maker of political deals
may be surprised to know that some of
the most careful business deals ever made
by the Central Pacific Railroad Company
were made by Stephen T. Gage.
- ; Service of Forty Years.
others made fortunes through his friend
ship he is to-day a comparatively poor
man. He could have made thousands
where his friends and beneficiaries made
dollars, yet he was most scrupulously
honest wfth his company in dealings
where there was no tracing and no ques
tions asked. Whatever may be said of
Stephen T. Gage and his political moves,
he could have been worth millions to-day
had he chosen so to be, and without
straining the term "honesty" as it is used
in the business world of to-day.
Unless'. some other school shows that none of
its advanced eightha failed, you will admit that
the Hancock is -in, the lead. Unless some other
school does better than to graduate twenty-one
of its pupils promoted one year ago j from sev
enth .grade, as was done in the Hancock, the
latter surejy must lead in that respect also.
Â¦Wishing t#* prove my Implicit obedience to
orders I did all I could to "encourage the De

have been doing all that I could to work out
the policy of an eight-year course, for I believe
in it; but those with whom we were compet

Miss McKenzie concludes:
Miss Margaret McKenzie, principal of
the Hancock Grammar School, sent a
statement to the Board of Education yes
terday in which she compares the promo
tions in the eighth grades of the Adams
and Hearst schools with those of the
Hancock School. Miss McKenzie seeks
to show that the percentage of failures is
greater in the other schools than in the
itencock School. Of the sixty-nine pupils
examined for graduation during the year
1S00-Q1 in the Adams ten railed, three
failed out of the thirty-eight in the
Hearst and only one failed in the Han

Board Keeps Them on
Duty to Carry Out
Shoeing Scheme.
. Members of the local fire department
have blended their voices in a long, sonor
ous howl at the action of the commission
controlling them in putting into effect the
scheme to shoe department horses in the
department stable. The effect of this
scheme is to deny summer vacations to
the men of all engine and truck compa
nies, from which men understanding the
art of shoeing a horse have been taken
and detailed at the stable. . ' .
In all ten companies are affected, and
the deplal of summer vacation to the men
of thesa companies is not the worst hard
ship the- scheme, has worked. In these
companies the men are even denied their
usual two days a month off. All must re
main on duty continuously. When the
call for horseshoers was made Chief Sul
livan selected live men to do the work.
At the time several men were off on vaca
tion, but they were ordered to return to
duty. Then the order went out that to
the members oi those companies from
which horseshoers had been taken sum
mer vacations would be denied.
If the action of the Board of Fire Com
missioners was actuated by necessity the
members of the department -say they
would have no complaint, but they look
upon the establishment of a horseshoeing
department as a political play to even a
score with J. F. Kennedy, who success
fully waged legal war against the com
mission, knocked out the* board's award
of the horseshoeing contract to John
O'Rourke and secured a judgment declar
ing himself^the lowest bidder and entitled
to the contract.
The board worried Kennedy along, how
ever, and though declared by the courts
to be entitled to the contract he was given
but little opportunity to profit by the
court's judgment. The charter provides
for the manner in which contracts shall
be let, and at the same time makes it in
cumbent, \t is asserted, for the shoeing of
horses to De done by contract. Notwith
standing this fact, when Kennedy finally
won his fight for the contract the Com
missioners went to work and established
a horseshoeing department. Kennedy has
in consequence "been forced to again sue
the commission, and that case is now be
fore the courts.

YOTTNG MEN'S INSTITUTE
TO HOLD GRAND COUNCIL
pÂ»TÂ»Â«^HB Election . Commissioners met
Â¦" I -yesterday forenoon and decided to
II . postpone action on the Republican
Jl petitions for apportionment , until
after, the meeting of the Republi
can State Central Committee. The motion
to postpone was j made by - Commissioner
Sheldon G. Kellogg, who said:
Â¦ "It has been brought to our attention
by one of the parties that a meeting of
the State Central Committee has been
called for the purpose of passing upon
this matter, and as a law has been passed
giving the State Committee power to act I
move that the matter be postponed until
next Monday."
A. Ruef , representing the Anti-boss Re
publican County Committee, made an un
answerable argument in support of the
proposition tbat the Ejection Commission
ers had authority to act. He argued that
the law passed by the last Legislature
giving the State Committee power in the
premises was unconstitutional' as the
constitution of the State expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should' not pass
a general law concerning municipal af
fairs. The city charter, section â , Article
II, declares that all. matters pertaining to
elections in the city and county shall be
vested: and exercised by the Board, of
Election Commissioners, i Section 11S6 of
the Political Code sought to override the
charter and exjerclse a municipal author
ity.
Ruef also argued that section 1186 waB
a special law applying to only such po
litical parties as had State ' committees.
It could not apply to such parties as tho
Non-Partisan party, which had no State
Committee. That party could get its rul
ings from the Election Commission,
while the Republican party, 'if the pro
visions of this law were recognized as
binding, would have to go to the State
Committee; which -was not a legal body
and was responsible to nobody.
Has No Authority.
In concluding Mr. Ruef said: "Admitting
that all I have said is mere breath and
not sense, section 1186 is not valid or can
not operate until a State committee has
been formed under that law. It cannot be
retroactive. We have never admitted that
the County Committee was governed by
the State Committee. They are different
entities.. The State Committee . has no
power to take away the rights of any
body. I want my cases decided, by gentle
men sworn in as public officers to perform
their duties fairly and not by a packed
committee. I could show you that the
body making this application has no legal
standing if you cared to go into that mat
ter. Suppose we should not recognize the
State Commfttee. Suppose we should not
go before them, -knowing that they have
no authority to act. Then suppose they
adopted the other petition. Are we bound
by that?" ' Â»
Commissioner M. Greenblatt â¢ was not
disposed to shirk responsibility.. He voted
against postponement. Commissioner
Oliver Everett also voted against Mr. Kel
logg's motion. /Commissioner A. W. Voor
sanger -voted with Mr. Kellogg to post
pone. There was a tie and Commissioner
Jeremiah Â¦ Deasy, president of the board,
cast the deciding vote in favor of a post
ponement.
It is regarded as certain that the State
body will recognize the Kelly-Crimmins
boss committee. The special meeting was
called at the suggestion of the bosses. The
request for the meeting emanated from
the bosses. The Election Commissioners
did not advise or solicit the interference.
The time for action by the Commission
ers had not arrived when the call for a
meeting of the State committee was is
sued. It is the. plain, simple truth that
the bosses became alarmed at the popular
agitation In favor of honest municipal
government under Republican auspices
and appealed to the Republican State or
ganization for help. It happens, however,
that very littls help can be. given by -the
State committee.' There is no such thing
as an official ticket to be recognized. The
space on the'ticket is left blank in the
party column, and pasters bearing the
names of delegates must be attached; The
proper way for citizens. to resent' the in-
terference of the State Central Committee
in local affairs is to attach the pasters Is
sued by the Republican Primary League.
These pasters will contain the names of
anti-boss Republicans. " "
The bosses, by the assistance of the Re
publican State organization, may derive a
slight advantage in preliminary organiza
tion of the municipal convention, but if
good citizens are alive to a sense ot their
duty the convention will be so overwhelm
ingly anti-boss in sentiment that the
Kelly-Crimmina crowd will not.be able to
resist delegates representing the honest
masses of the Republican party in San
Francisco. i

The Board of Election Commissioners
yesterday adopted the following resolu
tions: :--.--â¢; Â¦ ' ...
Resolved. That all political parties and In
dividuals taking advantage of the provisions
of the primary election law pertaining to the
use of pasters be required to adopt a uniform

be procured at the office of the Registrar.
Resolved, That the attached sample, as to
color, size and type, be adopted by the board,
and that the names of delegates on said paster
be printed In long primer capitals and small
capitals, | with the names a uniform distance
apart,' the color to be white and its size 3 6-8

TheTosemite Commission is not going
to turn the beautiful valley into a sort
of Midway Plalsance on a large scale by
means of rows upon row's of electric
lights, white or colored, up and down the
Bridal Veil Falls and around and around
in bewildering circles along all the' tow
ering height of El Capltan. The gentle
men of the Sierra Club, It seems, rather
jumped at conclusions. _ In other words,
they did not wait to see what the other
fellows were going to do before they con
cluded that it was their time to say
things.
The Yosemite Commissioners are not
going into the show business. They are
simply considering a suggestion made by
Commissioner 'Short to throw a search
light on Yosemite Falls, and even that is
dependent upon the final word of the Gov
ernor. The Commissioners, in fact, are
only desirous that the hotels and stores
and State buildings in the valley shall be
lighted by incandescent lights, as hotels
and stores and State buildings out of the
valley are, and to this end is the pro
posed installation of an electric light
plant. It all came put at the meeting of
the commission held in W. W. Foote's
office yesterday afternoon. Governor
Gage was not present, and so Commis
sioner Henshaw of Oakland took the
chair. The other Commissioners present
were Foote, Short, Cluff and Kerckhoff
and Engineer Corey, who has made the
estimates of the cost of the installation
of the proposed plant.
There were some minor matters dis
posed of before the main question of the
electric light plant was brought up. Then
Engineer Corey took the floor with his
plans and blueprints, and proceeded to
give a technical explanation of the whole
scheme.
Commissioner Foote Is Serious.
"Before we enter upon this matter,"
said Commissioner Foote, "I want to ask
Mr. Corey whether there is -anything in
these proposed plans which will constitute
a desecration of the natural beauties of
the valley. I want to approach this mat
ter in the most serious spirit."'
"There is nothing," Corey replied. "In
cutting down trees to carry the pipe line
from the river to the electric light. plant
we have managed it so that not one per
son in five would ever perceive that the
ax had been used. Nothing of the pipe
line can be seen from the road. I speak
advisedly, for the trees have already been
cut."
"You are one of the directors of the
Sierra Club, are you not?" asked Foote.
"I am. unfortunately. The pÂ»wer-house.
of the plant, which is the only part of it
that will be visible in the valley, will be
of granite. It is modeled on that at On
tario and will be a most ornamental struc
ture, adding to rather than detracting
from the beauty of its surroundings."
It was suggested that Architect Mat
thews be asked to try his hand on an
original design for a power-house, by way
of getting the most beautiful structure
posbible, and the suggestion was adopted.
Then there was a discussion of the blue
prints and a statement by Corey as to
where it was proposed to place the lights.
There will be 700 of these in and around
the hotels and cottages and State build
ings and several hundred additional in the
shops and stores and houses of the dwell
ers in the valley, for the installation of
which these dwellers will pay. It is also
proposed to put up an arc light in front
of the hotel, another on the iron bridge
and lights on a line of poles running down
the valley from the light works to the ho
tels.
"But that will not be to desecrate the
valley?" asked Foote.
No Desecration Intended.
"Not at all," replied Engineer Corey.
"There will be 100 lamps -along the line
down the valley. These will be so ar
ranged that they can be cut out, or half
of them can be cut out at any time. The
pole line along which these lights will be
strung, will reach from the Happy Isles
down to the Central Hotel. - It . is Â¦ essen
tial to run down the road because of the
necessity for cutting away tree limbs in
carrying currents of high power through
timber. Any cutting of this kind off the
road would be a desecration."
"Well." said Commissioner Foote, "I
am in favor of this. I do not believe in
waving a red light before the gentlemen
who have criticized us, but I am getting
pretty tired of being criticized by people
who do not wait to find out what we are
going to do before sending us a set of res
olutions saying we are making ourselves
ridiculous. And I do not propose to stand
for it."
"But let us not be driven by criticism
to do more than we originally Intended to
do," said Commissioner Short.
"I prefer a hotel with a bed and a bath
myself," said Foote, "to sleeping on a pine
bough. Also, I prefer light to darkness.
Lastly, I would prefer to have these gen
tlemen come up here and consult with us
rather than send us such resolutions as
they have without anybody to represent
"It would be well,;' said Commissioner
Short, "to keep the light works out of
sight as far as possible." ,
"Well, I want lights on the roads," said
Commissioner Henshaw.
"And I," said Foote, "am tired of being
Jabbed in the newspapers, and in resolu
tions about things that I never intended
to do. Now how about Short's scheme
for lighting the falls? I want to know
about that, and he has got to stand for it.
What is the matter with putting red,
white and blue searchlights on the peaks
and giving the people red, white and blue
lights if they want them?"
Iii^hting Up the Palls,
The plan to light the falls of the Yo
semite, according to Engineer. Corey's es
timate, would involve an expenditure of
$7000. This plan calls for the installation
of a searchlight 'of enormous proportions,
or rather of four searchlights, at points
on the slope of Glacier Point, the lights to
have adjustable lenses so that the falls
would be lighted up from top to bottom,
and â¢ for their full width, whatever â¢ that
might be. The searchlights would bo
practically invisible from the hotels in
the daytime, and the wires leading to
them would also be out of sight. Their
installation, therefore, would not mar the
beauty of the valley, and the trail It would
be necessary to build to put the lights in
place would be a great convenience to
visitors. This trail would cost $1800 addi
tional to make. The total cost of the elec
tric lighting plant for the valley, exclu
sive oi' the searchlight plant for Illumin
ating, would bo J23.000. This would' make
a grand total of expenditures of over $30,
000, or $5000 more than the appropriation
available, but as there are other funds at
the disposition of the commission this con
sideration would not stand in the way.
Commissioner Foote suggested, however,
that as the Governor was particularly in
terested in the illumination scheme,' it
would be well to let that go over until he
could be present. This i suggestion was
adopted, and then Engineer Corey was
instructed to prepare specifications for
bids for the electric lighting, plant in the
valley to be submitted to a meeting of the
commission to -be held on Monday after
noon, July 22. â¢
Among . the minor matters disposed ' of
was a letter from Dr. Keene of Philadel
phia, complaining of the. dust' and rocks
on the road to the valley. As the com
mission had no jurisdiction over the -toll
road the letter was laid on the table.
It was decided to turn water. from the
river to make a lake in the valley in the
low, swampy ground about Hutchin son's
Camp.. " - - Â¦â¢Â¦',' Â¦ Â¦
Guardian Stevens was allowed to employ
a helper at not more than $25 per month
to work in his; office during four months
of the busy season.
The photographers In the valley com
plained that Boyesen.had put up a sign,
"Kodaks for rent," at Corey's Camp,
which they said was doing business in
too many places; but as Corey was will
ing the Commissioners thought : the other
photographers would better try to be - a
little enterprising on their own account.
