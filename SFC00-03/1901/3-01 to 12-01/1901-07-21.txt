There Â¦was a time when she spent the
hours from daylight to dark out in the
forest of derricks, where smoky engines
and wheezy pumps fill the air with dis
mal noises, where the only pleasant sight
or sound, even. to an oil man! is the tiny
stream of greenish oil that flows from
pipe to tank. But that was in the begin
ning when she had more time for prac
tical details and when she needed prac
tical knowledge and a market.
To-day every detail of this intricate
business is at her fingers' ends. Ehe Is
expert in testing oil and knows the qual
ity of oil produced by every well In thÂ«j
field and she has yearly contracts with
the largest consumers of fuel oil In LoÂ»
Angeles, contracts renewed from year to
year. She has learned, too, what men to
trust when they tell her their oil run*

time, however, when she had proved to

they showed their confidence by giving

This was the result of strict business
methods and absolute honesty. Mrs. Sum

I had to build a house to put them in.
Then I saw a chance in the oil business
and sunk a well, and this has carried me
on and on, till I don't know where it will
stop.".
When the oil craze broke out In Los
Angeles some twenty years ago Mrs. Sum
mers was one cf the first to try her for
tune in oil. She had saved just $700 from
.per teaching, and this she decided to put
:lnto an oil well, some one agreeing to fur
nish a like amount. And 3he did put It in.
tooâ so deep that â¢ she thought it would
never come out. With It went $1900 more,
for Mrs. Summers' credit was good.
Boring oil wells then was not what it is
now. The equipment was meager, and
the experience of those who drilled wells
more meager still.
Bad luck followed bad luck, and the
climax came when first the casing and
then the tools went crashing into the well.
-Only the man who had drilled the hole
. was left on top.
Day after day Mrs. Summers stood by
that hole. Night after night she hovered
iJver it as she would watch a babe that
.'had swallowed a tack and three pins. The
-..prospect was dreary, but Mr3. Summers
jiever ?ays dltÂ». and shÂ« fenew there was
oil in the well.
When ihe hardware was finaliy fished
out the plucky woman went on boring,
not only the one well, but another, and
another and another. It was this whole
!i a 0.000 S SnTe!t. Of We " 3 ttat ier
. - Meanwhile Mrs. Summers was teaching
music to ,help pay the hardware bills.
-Even after she was out of debt and had
reached her ten thousand dollar mark, the
music lessons continued, chiefly because
Jier pupils would not quit coming. In
t deed, it is less than a year since the last
one was induced to go elsewhere for in
struction.
â¢Gradually, as Mrs. Summers found more
market than she could supply with her
own she began -to buy from
others, _ sometimes so many barrels a
rncr.th, sometimes, as a matter of specu
lation.the*year's output of a well. -And
. so, -without" realizing it. this woman be
came a power in the local oil world.
But - such ups and ' downs as she â¢ had !
".There have been times when It seemed
she could not win out. that everything
must go. but the woman's unerring judg
ment, indomitable will and perseverance
always bring things to the right about.
Even now the streaks of good and bad
run like streaks of lean and fat In bacon,
but Mrs. Summers has learned to take
both as they come. Taking-, for example,
a day when one of her houses was partly
destroyed by fire, one of her wagons broka
dewn In the field, with a big contract to
till, and "her horse gave her arm a bad^
wrench, all within a few hours, any one
would grant her the right to cryâ but she
didn't, because the telephone rang Just
then, or a man called to talk over soma
deal.
She hasn't time for tears any more than
she." has time for society. Once a week
regularly she goes to the theater for men
tal relaxation, but dlnings, receptions and
the rest of femininity's pet functions ara
anything but recreation. They bore her,
and she escapes them when she can.
With no children of her own, Mrs. Sum
mers is not without maternal cares. Sha
Is thfe best of mothers to tho three or
phaned children of a friend. On her death
bed the mother of these little onea. whose
-father had died some time before, was
burdened with the thought of her.chil
dren's future. "What will become of
them?" she sighed to the friend of her
girlhood. And Mrs. Summers gave- her
-word that they, should be well cared for
How faithfully the promise has been kept
can be guessed when one knows that Mrs.
Summers has refused to allow them to
be adopted into good homes, feeling that
she has no right to give them away. She. Â¦
has them under the care of a worthy wo
man, gives them a house, to live in and
provides for them as If they were her own
â and loves them. ' ..
In business Mrs. Summers is every inch,
the man. Away from business she is
every, inch the woman, barring her dis
like for society.
She can cook, embroider and sew and
has all the accomplishments considered
necessary for women one generation back
If necessity had not come to develop her
wonderful - capacity for affairs she would
be the happiest and most contented of
home bodies. As It Is now, she loves her
home as well as she loves her business.
"I wouldn'Â± have an office downtown for
anything," She i asserts with upraised
hands and a look of terror at the very
thought. "And I couldn't go on the oh
exchange with all those men â not for any
thing. I never was on 'change In my
life." And yet she has managed to buy .
and sell many a block of stock, and with
out the aid of a broker. There are ways
of : hiding one's light tinder a bushel if
one cares to. and still keep it burning.
"My husband is, awfully nice," Mr3.
Summers Is wont to say with truly femi
nine pride. â¢ "But we never talk about
business unless it Is to tell some little In
cident that comes up." No doubt thla is
one reason she and her husband are such S
good friends. Each goes his own way,
having. perfect confidence In the other. "
.When the first venture was made In borl
Ing for oil, it was Mrs. Summers' scheme,
but her husband stood back of herâ or, bf- â¢
side her. But Mr. Summers is conserva
tive and less aggressive in business mat
ter's than his wife, and when she vras Â«
fairly started In her speculative and un
certain career as an oil producer, he
turned his attention again to his cwn
business. VThat he has every confidence
in his wife Is evidenced, by the fact ihat
she holds always, whether he is at home
building houses or in Cape Nome lookincr
after his mining properties, a power of
attorney which authorizes her to sell any
thing he has. "
: .And . here Is nomething that smacks of
Inconsistency. Mrs;: Summers never ad-,
vises, any woman to go into business.
,.."So' many women come to me and ask
my advice, and I always tell them to go
back and attend -to their housekeeping.
"I love business \ myself ." she admits.
"I can't . help being . a business woman,
but it, is. too strenuous a life for every
woman. There are * too many difficulties
to Â¦ sunnount, too many trials to undergo
before "success is attained. The success

THE CALIFORNIA OIL QUEENARE NIAGARA FALLS TO BECOME A THING OF THE PAST?
gEFPRE Niagara Falls, which are
now cutting their way backward
along the bed of the river to Lake
Erie at the rate of about f ouiTfeet
a year,' reach the head of Grand
Island less than five miles away, there
will be no Niagara. The whole system of
the great lakes is changing. The waters
of Lake Michigan at Chicago are slowly;
rising and Lake Erie is growing shallow.,
\ Eventually, unless a dam Is built to pre
vent it, as. has been proposed. Lake Michi
gan will overflow to the Illinois River, as
it did centuries ago In the last preglacial
period; the basin of Lake Erie will be
I tributary to Lake Huron, the current will;
be reversed in the Detroit and the St.
Clair channels, and the whole lake system
will drain southward into the Mississippi.
Then Niagara will vanish. From a ma
jestic cataract the falls will/dwindle to
a few threads of water falling over a
precipice," as may be seen In the summer
season in the upper falls of the Genesee at
Rochester. All that they will carry will
be the drainage of : t;he immediate neigh
borhood, v;.;. - /'"' 'Â¦ " r U .
..- There isn't 'any occasion for alarm for
the present, however, for all-this will take
place in from 2000 to 3000 years from now,
anu many things may happen before then.
Also, as/It is extremely unlikely that the
elixir of life will, be discovered in this gen
eration, nobody now "; alive need j worry '
niuch about it. But , that is what the
great lake system is pending" to, as is set
forth in an interesting "Guide to the Ge
ology and Paleontology of Niagara Falls
and Vicinity," by Professor Amadeus W.
Grabau, S. D., of Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, arranged and" published In most
complete form by John M. "Â¦ Clarke, the

It will be from" 500" to 600 years before the
tendency of the lakes to a new drainage
, bed >s pla'nly manifested! according to the
| authorities cited Y by Professor :Grabau.
, The rising of the waters of Lake Michigan
I at ; : present | is at Â»the fate* of ; nine or â¢ ten
inches a century. 'The first water to over
flow will be that at \ some high stage of
the lake and the discharge may at first
be intermittent. For a mean lake stage
such a discharge will begin in about 100)
years, but after 1500 years there will be" no
interruption. ; . . . / â¢
In abflut 2000 years the Illinois Riveriand
the Niagara will carry equal Â»shares of the
surplus water of the great â¢ lakes, and in
?500 years for certain*, there will be . no
Niagara.. Â¦ " - â¢ ."/â¢
That is if man. In the shape of the
. United States Government, does not inter
fere. The shoaling'of Lake Erie at Cleve
land and at othei* points on the Ohio shore
has already given cause for alarm,, and
the stoppage cf this natural movement, in
the general drainage system of the lakes,
.which is attributed to the gradual tilting
of the land in the northwest, has been se
riously considered. '..-">..'
* The plan proposed to stop the tendency
is to erect an immense dam in the Niag
: ara River above Buffalo,' with the object
of checking and eventually, decreasing the
outflow. It is argued that' this would not
greatly decrease the power of Niagara,
now valuable; but there are authorities
who contend that this argument is absurd
and the plan is opposed on. that account, g
I ' This tilting of the territory in the
Northwest is a curious phenomenon, for
which the 'geologists .cannot wholly ac
c6unt. It is plainly recorded , in . the
beaches of the j old ' glacial lakes, which
had; a uniform elevation while forming,
but now are no longer of a uniform height
above the sea level, rising progressively
. toward the northeast. The movement is
.still going on. '-â¢>â¢" 7 . â - ;
Professor G. K. Gilbert has made an ex
tended study of the problem, and he, has
been led to the assumption that the whole
lake region is being lifted on. one side or
â¢ depressed on the other, so that' its plane
is> bodily/canted toward the south-south
-west.; The rate of change, he estimates,
' is. such .that the two ends of a. line 100
miles long and lying in a south-southwest
direction, are relatively displaced to , the
â¢extent of four-tenths of a foot in- a cen
tury. From this it T follows that the waters
of? each lake are gradually rising on the
southern and western shores or falling on
Uhe* northern- and eastern shores* or both.
Niagara Falls came into existence when
. the I waters .= of ' Lake Iroquois, which Â¦ In
( age's ' long past was the; ; predecessor' of
"Lake Ontario, fell beneath the leveFof the
I escarpment at ; Lewistoh. At first the falls
-were, only a small cataract, ; but - year by
year v as .the llake subsided the cataract
gained in height and consequently in. force
of 'fall, as well as efficiency in cutting "its
channel. , The Niagara gorge' from Lowis
ton to the present falls, is_ believed to be
wholly the product of river erosion. ; . ."
Before the advent of the falls the Ni
agara was a placid. stream from lake to
lake much as it is to-day from Buffalo
to the northern end of Grand Island. It
cut shallow banks into' the glacial till
and their traces are seen now some
places a mile back from the edge of the
gorge which the falls have since cut.
It has been patiently cutting that gorge
for thousands of years, how many the
geologists cannot tell, but they place
the total at not less than 10,000 or more
than 50,000. One "geologist. Professor
Hitchcock, puts the beginning . of the
great cataract of 1025 B. C, which is 30)
years before the time of Romulus, : or
about the period in which King David
reigned in Jerusalem.
As long as a river Is narrow and vig
orously undercuts Its banks the latter will
be steep and the river channel will have
the 'character of a gorge. This continues
as long as the river is cutting downward,
that is, till'; the grade or the *river bot
tom is a. very gentle _pne. Then the
spreading of the current undercuts the
banks, -and atmospheric, degradation
quickly destroys the cliffs,' which the
river does not keep perpendicular. Niag
ara gorge changes ;greatly even in a cen
tury, Before the. falls the river flows in
a channel in places only ten feet wide and
100 feet below the level of the platform,
which was its bed a century ago.
There is a theory that only >: a part, the
southern or latter part of the gorge. of
the whirlpool rapidsrwas carved by .the
Niagara, the volume of which was at one
time reduced by the buried St. David's
gorge, since swept away in a glacial pe
riod, and that the greatest half of ,the
gorge was preglacial. All the authorities
agree, however, that the broad and deep
gorge "from Clifton , to the present falls
was made by a cataract carrying the full
supply of water. This, which geologists
say Is the most readily, interpreted part
of the gorge, has now corner to an end at
the present falls, and the-character of the
channel hereafter can: only .be con
jectured. *
.-. Niagara, it seems, is; now at a critical
stage. â¢ The river has reached the second
of the points where a rectangular turn la
made, and the gorge behind the falls Is
changing. .. A short , canal,
narrower than that of. the last section, is
being cut by : the Horseshoe fall, and that
fall itself ti . narrowing. This narrowness
of the channel is due to the* concentration
of water in the- center of ; the stream.
Goat Island, : which divides . the Horse
shoe from the ; American fall, and the
other islands as well, owes its existence
tp this concentration of the water, for at
one time all of these inlands were sub
merged by. the _ current." The channel
above the Horseshoe fall has been cut to
more than fifty feet below the summit of
Goat Island at the falls, while tha upper
â¢ end of the island is still at the level of
J the water in the river. The effect will be
that the island as an island In time will
disappear.
It lies on one side of the main mass of
water which, rushing forward., passes it
and strikes the * Canadian bank, from
which it is deflected toward the center of
the cataract, that portion being thus
deepened and worn back most rapidly, as
may be observed from the upper walks of
the Canadian park, where In many cases
the shores have been ballasted and other
wisaproteeted from the current.
In an earlier period, when the falls were
farther north and before the central part
of the stream had been deepened to It3
present extent, the water, then at the lev
el of the river above Goat Island, flooded
what is now Queen Victoria Park and
carved, from the glacial hill the pro
nounced concave wall which now bounds
the park on the west. A local eddy, prob
ably in very recent times, carved the steep
and semi-circular cliff which Incloses the
Dufferin Islands.
In 1000 years from now and at the pres
ent rate of recession of the falls it is cal
culated by the geologists, whose views are
set forth by Professor Grabau. that the
Horseshoe Falls will have reached the up
per end of Goat Island, and that will end
the American Falls. These having a
I smaller erosive force will have receded
only' about half way to the Goat Island
bridge in that time. The Horseshoe Falls*
will draw off the water from the Ameri
can Falls, and all of the-lslands will 'then
be joined by a dry channel to the main
land, an event which. Professor Grabau
say?, was anticipated only as far back as
. 1848. when owing to an ice blockade in the
Niagara River^iear Buffalo the American
Falls wa3 deprived of all its water for a
day. Should a dam be built in the Niagara
River the effect might be the same.
This is not the first time in the history

to be a,cult..at{ Berkeley. -. Not oniy the

presence, and he was a~ mark of esteem,
respect and affection for all classes. While
"sociable and light in spirit, he did not en-'
tertain or care to entertain, yet he seemed
to enjoy all social functions In which he
took part. In Berkeley Lo* Conte had two
very. close frienfisâ John''Garber, foremost â¢
of Western lawyers, and George Howison,
whose philosophy has raised more than
one" storm in the quiet, peaceful shades of
the university town. Â¦ ,. ."..
These three men would come together
on many,; occasions, arid all with* different
views of life, systems of ethics and cosmic
philosophy, would talk the oil out of the
lamps. -Howison never, would or could
agree with Le Omte's system of ethics.
Close and sound -in their friendship, they
were often at swords' points over matters
of theoretical philosophy. U
Tt has been said of Howison that as
' ch as he loves his friends he will put
"them on' the grill whenever Intellects
cia.sh. And # many an Interesting side lec
ture has been delivered (fn the rooms at
the university by Howison on Le Conte
and Le Conte .on Howisoh. / A favorite
scheme of the students was to visit Pro
. fessor Le Conte soon after a lecture by
Howison' and ask for his opinion. or views
on this and that philosophical point
educed by the nominated teacher of phil
osophy, at the university. Then "Prof.
Joe" - would straighten himself up and
with characteristic outward gesture and
Â¦a smile that played incessantly upon hit.
r :ne old countenance he would launch
forth in an .'explanation or accounting
that proved, at least to himself the abso
lute, right of his own philosophy. Le
Cont'e treated his antagonist with the
greatest respect and deference, even
showing consideration for his theories. of
ethics.'. Not so with Howisoh. . When the
same students would come to him with a
bit cf Le Conte there was a general dam
nation after a tribute to the man. Of.aU
the good and just things said of Le Conte,
the eulogies and the panegyrics, perhaps
none will equal the few'words spoken how
and then by George Howison in the class
roomsâalways previous to a slaughter of
Le Conte's ethical theories.'
V Old as Professor Le Conte was, he would
never acknowledge physical weakness.
Even to the last regular course of lec
tures he delivered at the university , he
would mount a ladder, tack up his charts
and during his lectures he- would stand
with pointer in hand, ever ready and ac
tive. ' Once about eight years ago a stu
dent''offered to assist him in the. hanging
of charts bn^the blackboard. His offer
was a bit ".grufflyâ declined.
Professor Davidson tells a story* about Le
Conte's ' pride in his own physical yigbr.
The two were walking through the col
lege grounds, when Professor Davidson
unconsciously lifted his arm to lighten the
labor of his friend's steps. Le Conte dis
played his dislike for such assistance im
mediately by .drawing away just far
enough to separate himself from his com
panion."
Professor Le. Conte was an exceedingly
.temperate- manâ in thought, manner and
daily actionâ though by no means an
ascetic. : He enjoyed life and all things
that go .with it. "Whether in the valleys
or the mountains, at the seaside or in the
fields, he found much to fasten his mind
upon. They were. not cold dust or rock
or so much water to him. Le Conte was
nothing if not imaginative and poetic in
everything he has done .or said. In the
Yosemite he lost sight two hours>ut of
every three, of the geological values. The
natural beauty. appealed to him. and somo
of his descriptions of the valley are- .most
beautiful and genuinely valuable from a
literary standpoint. â¢ â
As a bit of imagination coupled -with
science his students In comparative zool
ogy will remember Le Conte's description
of a glass of champagne. To this scien
tist the peculiar power and fascination of
the gurgling wine was due to the fact that
It appealed directly to" four senses. â¢
The description f went . something Ilka
this: "The molten amberiike liqGid, with
its myriads of crystal bubbles rising from
the depths, its delicious flavor holding the
tongue in. a charm .that knows no break-'
Ing, the savor arising to the nostrils and
picturing olfactory images as beautiful in
their way as anything that appeals to thÂ»
eye; all these make champagne. It Is the
nectar, the ambrosia of the sublunar
world." " , ' .
If champagne meant so much to the old
scientist he showed a temperateness that
was astounding. He rarely drank more
than a single glass of wine at a dinner or
even at t a. banquet, and whenever asked
to fill his glass again would always reply
by saying that he -enjoyed the flrst so
much and so satisfactorily that he did
not care to clog and sicken his appetite
with more. " '
His partial abstinence from tobacco was
equally â¢well sustained. It is doubtful if
many of his friends have ever seen him
smoke, yet he indulged on occasions .' in a
short cigarette. "When handed a cigar
ette one evening at a banquet he uncon
sciously took it, but realizing in a mo
ment that he did something foreign to his
habits laid it down on the ; table. To a
question Le Conte replied: . "Oh, yes, I
smoke, but only before going Into the lec
ture room, and then I roll myself a cigar
ette. "It does me a whole lot of good.
Why, I smoke as much as a quarter of a
pound of tobacco every year." <
Banqueting Professor Le Conte was a
hobby with his friends. Scientific and lay
societies made him the guest of many a
special dinner. As an after dinne'r speaker
he always happy in his remarks,
never attempting the eloquent. His very
individuality, precluded bombast or falsa
rhetoric. When his subject was to his lik
ing he fell right into it with a dash and
vigor that were surprising to his auditors,
but he never cared to display any "of his
talents in after dinner speaking. He pre
ferred to listen, and he was a good
listener. '
Soon after his return from Europe In
the fall of 1S92 the University Club of this
city gave a banquet in his honor and
gathered around . the club' boards 'was
every man of educational or scientinc
nots in the city at the time. Professor
Muir, famous as a geologist and particu
larly as a discoverer of glaciers, was
called upon and naturally the cry of gla
ciers went up.. Professor Muir spoke of
glacial action In general and indications
of it in the Yosemite Valley. To this Le
Conte interposed an objection. When ho
was called upon to speak he said that he
would reluctantly admit of Tosemite gla
ciers, but "after all it was a poor, little,
miserable dwarf of a glacier and shouldn't
be taken into account with the bis ones
with small names."

Le Conte's work -where science and re
ligion cross was what endeared him to the
church going people and made him an
evolutionist of an odd though strong
type. . He believed In evolution as an un
deniable fact and all his scientific work
takes this as a fundamental basis for
elaboration. It was doctrinal, sdentlflo
gospel' to -him. Butyls beliefs In evolu*
tion went hand in hand with a stronger
belief Christianity. Amons his friends
he numbered severaT who stood on a plat
form" of agnosticism and even atheism.
Thew say that Professor- X* Conta's
ethical labors rested upon an endless
struggle to reconcile Christianity with
evolution and they hint at the severity of
the task. Like Faraday, tha ereat Eng
lish scientist, Le Conte was swept with
a tidal wave of faithâ an overpowering
and Irresistible faith In the biblical teach
ings as relating to the cardinal principles
of Christianity. The story of Faraday
Â¦was often repeated by L.e> Conte â that
Â¦when ho went to church he was over
whelmed with faith. Science then, was
forgotten* for the tlmo/S. .Â¦; .',
There 13 hardly any likelihood that.an
other professor will take Le Conte's placa
In the heart of the student body. They
say at the University of California that
the classes since his active days showed
as great a respect and affection for the
old scientist as those who felt the direct
power of his teaching. And Le Conte was
not proof against this reverence on the
part of. students. He liked appreciation.*
It warmed .his soul and brought Joy to his
heart. When on his seventieth birthday
the student body decorated hl3 classroom
with flowers the tears rolled out of the
old teacher's eyes and he responded in a
way that brought gulp3 to the throats of
some of the students. After that the
decoration of" Le Conte's room on an
niversaries became a custom.
One of "Professor Joe's" bosom friends
was George Davidson, eminent on this
coast as the head of the Coast - Survey.
Professor Davidson tells this story: "It
was no uncommon matter for Joe to drop
Into my office about 3 o'clock In the after
noon and find me busy at work.* He would
express astonishment at the fact that I
was so. persistent and steady at the desk.
I in. turn would ask him how he man
aged to finish his, dally work so easily.
Then, In his Inimitable way. he would use
a philosophy of the economy of labor and
prove to both of us that the best work
is accomplished, not by constant devotion,
but a wise discretion and a husbanding
of physical strength."
It was this same Georsre Davidson that
was called upon to welcome "Joe" La
Conte upon hl3 return from abroad. The
whole tone of his speech sounded the per
sonality of the. man and left science to
take care of itself. So it always was with
those who had the pleasure of Intercourse,
with Professor Le Conte. They forgot
the work of the man and felt only the In
fluence of a personality that 'will last as
long: as memory endures.

STORIES OF LE CONTE-PHILOSOPHER.' It's no use to cling to your qualms, how
ever, for you soon find that everybody
takes the trails, and you are strictly not
in it If you don't. It Is this prevailing
The trips all take about a day, for they
are made very slowly, very carefully. As
you look up from the floor of_the valley
at the perpendicular walls on every side
you feel that it would be impossible to
reach the dizzy height above. To trust
yourself on the back of an animal in such
a place looks like, sheer foolhardiness.
Thousands and thousands of people have
trailed on the animals that belong to that
firm. They are the only ones to trail on,
for the firm hafc. the concession, which
gives them the monopoly, with the re
striction that they do not charge an un
due price for the/ use of animals. I That
not undue price is $3 per day.

for themselves and to look out ror the
risky places themselves, no matter who
was on their backs.
He saw a future ahead In the trailing
business. Visitors to the wonder country
were growing more and more numerous.
In time, he argued, they would come In
crowds, they would be there by tire hun
dreds and the business of carrying them
on the long, steep trails whither their un
quenchable curiosity was always leading
them would be a business that would take
all of one man's time to attend to.
Besides all that, he Uked the brute3 and
he had a knack with them, too. They
took kindly enough to the steep places
when he was driving them, and they
didn't get used up as soon as with other
people. _ He knew how Â¦ to save their
strength. .
He knew how to teach them to do this
youngster of only 15. He worked In the
F.a<JdIe train that belonged to Washburn
and McReady in the first years of his liv
ing there, but he had too many Ideas of
his own to be satisfied with work-ins' for
anybody very long. He was getting usÂ«Â«I
to the business of trailing by that time
and he wanted to keep on with it.
GÂ«orge Kenney went to that country
thirty-five jears ago, when he was a
THERE is v man up In the Yosemlte
who has been training mule3 for
thirty-five years.
He says that training mules Is a
profitable business, too. And if you
listen to his figures you will think like
wise For although these 400 beasts upon
whom he depends for a livelihood work
only three months In the year, they earn
in those three months anywhere in the
neighborhood of $1300 a day. Now If- they
earn $1200 a day for three months, or
ninety days. It appears that their total
earnings will be $108,000. which is rather
a neat Income for mules.
Half of them are horses, but it's all the
came thing. For the horses do a mule's
work. They are the beasts that do the
trailing In the Tosemite, and they are
kept bo busy during the tourist season
that they can well afford to loaf during
the long months when the Yosemlte Is
left to the hotel-keepers and t>Â» stage
drivers and the glides.
Â¦ "I wouldn't take a plain-bred horse for
the work. They never can learn the busi

"I'll tell you the secret of having no ac

roads, but no tenderfoot ever does if he

fashion, thl3 social compulsion put upon
trailing, that has made such a big suc
cess of the business. Everybody has to
trail; whether he Is afraid or not, whether
he is used to horses or not. And, as a
matter of fact, there has never been an
accident with Kenney's mules in all these
thirty odd years.
There are five main trails In the To
semiteâEagle | Peak trail. Clouds' Rest,
Vernal and Nevada Falls, Glacier Point
and Dewey. â¢ You can't really see' the Yo
femlte unless you see it from every onÂ«
of these, for the views shift, like those of
a quick stereopticon,. and all of the im
pressions are different. Eagle Peak, the
highest, is a good deal'over 4000 feet.
"Every year there have to be new ani
mals bought, because the , old ones are
now and giving out, 'and also be
cause the ; business ; is all the time on a
big Increase. So we hold a school for
them and they are well educated horses
and mules 'before we let them graduate.
Day after day the newly chosen ones "are
taken out to .the trails; and put through
their paces."', Practice makes them per
fect. \ Before they are Â¦ ready, for the usa
of strangers they know every step of
every one of the" five trails, and there
is no possibility of their making a mis
step. They learn, too, how to save them-
."The -chosen half are then put to -work
in dead earnest. They must be thorough
ly ; taught their business. This training
process is carried on. by the way, In the
nine off months of the. year, and It takes
up a great part of the time, bo you see I
don't have much chance to Idle. " t -'-A.
"After testing it , generally turns , out
that only half of the animals are fit for
the work." The rest are discardedâ too
slippery of toot, too" weak in endurance or
too skittish. An average of half that we
try are fit to be kept. â¢
"All our animals are gentle and well
broken before we buy them. We see to
that all right. First thing I do with a
new horse is to take it Into the valley and
start It on the easiest trail. I have it
work up to the hardest one by degrees,
letting the guides test the enduring quali
ties with great care. This testing process
takes from one to three weeks. We don't
feel sure of any animal before that, and
we have to know them through and
through before we turn'them over to in
experienced riders.
"It depends altogether oh the beasts
how 'long they- will wear on the trails. "* I
have some now that have been at it for
ten and twelve seasons and are of the
best now. Others, started at the same
time, gave out Ions ago. Horses average
selves. This comes only with experience.
In the first placeâ In fact, for the first
year or two of trainingâ the animals show
a great inclination to hurry. It is ihelr
impulse to try to reach the top as aoon
as possible. If the top meant rest for
them this might do, but for their hard
lives, where reaching their goal means
only to turn back and retrace their path,
they must learn to economize-., their
strength. "We find them doing this after
a year or. two of the work. Then you will
find them wise horses; they will start out
on the trail slowly, as if weary, as if every
step were their last; they will be breath
ing hard, puffing; and when they finally
reach the top they â¢ will surprise the
anxious tourists on their Dacks by start
ing. back in the best of spirits, looking
fresher than when they began the day.
VYou . notice that I have both horses
and mules. That is for the purpose of
pleasing everybody. There Is an old
theory that mules are the more sure-foot
ed. For myself. I don't believe it. I'd
rather have a horse anytime. /It." is Just
as sure-footed and far less vexing to ride.
"That Is, a mountain-raised . horse,
which is the only kind we ever buy.". As
I said,' there's no use getting one which
has been raised on the plains. It"; has
never been used to climbing. - We buy the
mountain ', animals and 'we have to pay
more for them, but they are a "good deal
more than worth the difference. *.
the wayâ with larger parties It Is custom
ary to send one guide to lead and another
to Â¦ follow. â¢ During the Christian En
deavor- convention there were such
crowds for six days that all the horses ob
tainable were in constant use. As many
as 135 people were sent out In a single
party on the long trail and a guide was
allowed for every ten. Even then there
was not a single accident, not so much
as the least trouble with girths or cinches.
Kenney says they made a funny sight.
"Some had been told that the heat on the
trails was oppressive, others that the cold
in the snow-topped mountains was bit
ter, so the lot of. them started out in the
greatest collection of costumes you ever
saw. Some were- bundled In furs. Others
were dressed In the thinnest summer fab
rics and carried ' Japanese umbrellas.' My
guides wear a sort of Mexican riding cos
tumes, so the whole string looked : like
some sort of a carnival . parade." ..
- .Kenney's mules and horses are not only
trained to trail work, but many of them
have specialties â¢ besides. One old mule
named Pinto is always given to the kodak
fiends. He has been used to this par
ticular line of work for years and .there
isn't a point from which a picture can be
taken to advantage that Pinto doesn't
know.' â¢ He can get into difficult places
as. no 'other animal can.' Moreover he
stands stock still while the picture is be
ing taken and moves at the pressing of
the button. .
Pinto won't last forever, Â¦ Kenney says.
And then what will the kodak fiends do?
trails. -. .
With small parties one guide Is sent out
to look after saddles as well as to show
to the days of '51.
As a rule, the mules are given to men
and the horses to women. Mules are bet
ter on heavy loads. "When Ke%ney made
mention of this fact, he bethought htm of
a story concerning a heavyweight.
"Years ago we had a white mars
named Dolly Varden." he. said. "She;
made a reputation for herself as a first
class trail animal and for a while there
were half a dozen tourists a day asking
for her. I wanted to please them all, so
fiurlng the rush time I had to name eev
eral horses in my train Dolly Varden. As
long as they were all white it worked all
right.
"One day a strapping, big man cams up
here; must have weighed 250 easy. Ha
wanted Dolly Vardenâ said his friend
McKay had told him to ridÂ© no other.
Now the original Dolly Varden was not
good at heavy loads, nor were any of her
white namesakes. I decided to take a
chance on his not having been told the
color of McKay's favorite.
"One of my guides was standing with
an old iron gray truck horse. The ani
mal had long ago given up trailing and
had been hauling rock3 in the valley, lc
was the only beast X knew of that could
manage the load In view.
'â¢ 'Certainly, you shall have Dolly, sir,"
I said and I called the guide. 'Here,
Mike, I said. Hake Dolly Varden thera
and - saddle her up for this gentleman.
He's a friend of McKay's.'
"Jumbo was the brute's real name, but
neither he nor Mike ever told the truth.
Mike was wise all rignt. He and Mc-
Kay's friend started up the trail.
"In the evening the big man came to my
desk. He looked tired.
" 'I say/ Kenney/ he said. the. brute did
falrlv well, but between you and me I
don't think McKay i3 much of a Judge oÂ£
horseflesh.' " â¢ Â» -â¢ *
The harness of the animals is carefully
arranged * for the climbing. There are
forward -and rear girths, which prevent
the saddle slipping either way. Other
wise it would be hard to stay on the backs
of the horses in the steepest parts of the
more years* wear than mules.â

Mr. MacGrath's friends rejoice with him in his success, for he is a
very popular young man. He is a good story-teller, an entertaining talk
er and an expert listener, though a little deaf. He is modest and unas
suming, simple in his tastes and unaffected in his dress and bearing. He
knows a sweet briar pipe when he sees it and a good "cup of sack" when
he tastes it. He has another novel in his head," but declines to talk shop.
For years he was a reporter, contributing occasional verse. Then
the Syracuse Herald gave him a column every day in which to be both
poet and humorist. While at this easy job he wrote his first long story.
Every one that read it liked it, but unfortunately only a comparatively
few read it. His English blood served him well in this crisis. Calm and
unafraid, he sat down to write another. "The Puppet Crown" was the
result. It is finding that great army of readers which his first book
missed.
Mr. MacGrath was born. in. Syracuse, HT. ,Y. His father was an Irish
man, his mother of English parent age. - The son inherited the dominant
traits -of .both, v races-^Vit"and the love of a "scrap" from his" father, and

escape. It was foreordained that he must scratch for a living. Which
should it be^â a novelist, a journalist, a humorist, or just a rhymester?

Of chrrrcrters there sire not many. Mr.

Mr. Carton !s a T-ity man who has the
city mÂ£.n'f= cr?7.c to try farm life. An ex-
c\isÂ« comes through the legitimate cliah
nH of a physician's advice. The doctor
advise? that Paul be given a few years in
Ihe country. Carton is eager to take all
h:s monpy out of the bank at once and
lay in a large supply of farming machinery
and buy jive stork, but his wife limits
him to a "hoe. rake and shovel."
Mrs. Carton is firm and succeeds be
cayse to hring him to time she has only
to hold up her husband's money-making
venture whf>n hÂ» lost a -tew hundred on
mining stocks. Moreover, she quotes what
Aunt Sophy has to sayV "*Â¦ ,_^ . /â¢ '.
Aunt Sophy says that all men"wtÂ»o havpn't

insane belief, at some period of their livesi
that they can make money by farming. She
rays T"ncle Philip had made S100.000 In the groc
ery business when he retired and bought a
farm. She implored him not to do it. but he
persisted, saying there was heaps of money
In farmina If properly managed, and he could
run a farm on business principles and make
It rsy. But when he died she found he had
left only J40.0TO for her to live on. and she Is
convinced that if he hadn't been taken away
so suddenly she would have been altogether
pennies. Poor Aunt Sophy! She weeps more
over thst money than over Uncle Philip, and
the worst of It is that some semi-religious
nnvel she has read has unsettled her old-fash
ioned ideas about heaven so that she ls afraid
that when her turn comes she will find him at
5t again. The thought has hardened her so
that I shouldn't be surprised if she married old
Mr. Fairman and renounced Uncle Philip.
Haring settled tho question as to how
extensive thÂ«ir farming operations shall
be, they hie them forth to the courtry to
look up a farm. They find a place for
rent that is Just the one to suit them, and
meet with an idventure at the same time.
The introduction to their future landlord
is startling:
We had stopped to look down the entrance
to a large underground roothouse. the door of
which was open, when from the Inside came a
euccesElon of feeble groans. There was a heap
of bags in the doorway, and In an instant I
realised what had happened: that some man
had been overcome by the poisonous gases that
gather In pits where vegetables are stored.
I am not one who rashly plunges into dan
ger without weighing the consequences, so I
Â¦didn't- bravely lose my life by rushing into the
pit In the vain attempt to carry another man
out. for I saw there were several good reasons
against such a course. First. I knew that I
couldn't carry a man anywhere under the
most favorable conditions; second. I couldn't
bear to think cf the shock to Marion if she
should become a widow; third, it was perfectly
clear to me that If I remained in the roothouse
Marion would attempt to save me, then Paul
would remain outside and become an orphan,
a howling orphan. Further. I vu not Justi
fied in risking an undoubtedly valuable life
for one that was proba"bly of no account.
A long pole with a hook on the. end would
have been useful, or a niece of rope, but
neither waÂ« to be found, and the groans of the
man Â»n the roothouse were becoming still more
alarming, so. noticing the heavy chain 1 which
held the well bucket, I hurriedly tried to de
tach It, but to my despair I found it was se
curely Fpiked to the well-sweep. It was then
that Marion made one of the most brilliant
FUggestions that I have known her to make:
thÂ»t by Bwinjringr the sweep to one side the
chein. would hang directly over the pit. I
don't know that she saw the full utility of
this move, bet I did. Holding my breath I
rtood in the doorway until I could dimly nee
the prostrate figure of the man on the floor,
then I darted Inside, looped the chain about
him and dragged him to the entrance. He was
a heavily built, sharp-featured man, past mid
dle age, and although he lay 'on the ground
and gasped for breath there was a slight con
tortion of bis features that suggested repressed
mirth. Marion wanted me to go for help, but
I told her that he ' Tas recovering: and only
needed to be moved from' the entrance where
he lay to the level ground 'where the air was
freeber. Fhe paid I would never be able to get
him up. the Incline, bo I hastened to complete
my task, my only fear being that help would
arrive too soon. I tenderly arranged a pad
of potato bags across. his cbeet and back., then
Fbortening.the chain -I passed it under his arms
and again looped it around his hodr. All belns
reaiy. I ellir.bed up on the weighted end of
the well-sweep, but finding there was not
â¢nciisrb freight I persuaded Marion to take my
jttace, then I tprang- up beside her. Tfce effect
"Tim might be able to milk a cow that had
milk." he said with a chuckle, after listening
to my tale, "but it'd take old Nick to raise
a calf on a dry one." . '. - Â¦
"A dry one!" I shouted. "Do you mean "
"Did the old man tell you it was this cow's
calf?" he Interrupted.
"Well, noâ I can't remember that he did. He
fa id I'd better take the calf, too, and I sup

"Exactlyâ then he's salted you right enough!
We had missed the first afternoon train, and
after a dreary wait for the next one we ar
rived at the little country station just at dusk,
and before we reached Waydean darkness had
fallen. We groped our way around to the
back door and stumbled into the kitchen,
where I lit a candle I had brousrht. My heart
sank at the first glance about the room, for It
was quite empty and I feared that our goods
had not arrived, but when I peered fearfully
into the next room I saw that what looked
at first like* railroad box car was a rectangu
lar â¢ erection of all our household belongings.
.We stared -Incredulously by the. light of the
flickering candle, walking around the structure
in despair. Next the ceiling,, like a statue on

The descriptions that- follow of a city
man's live in the country! his first feel
ings cf chagrin when he heSys the old
farmers criticizing him because Ife^has no
implement*' and stock and ls not a "real
farmer" ; his tall lies to an acquaintance
in town on the extent of his ranch are
all very cleverly presented and not a bit
overdone. There is none of the rouerh
burlesque of 'the comic artist order. The
humor Is most genuine and entertaining.
Their chickens are pets for Paul, the
son and heir, and therefore cannot be sac
rificed, not even when the rich old aunt
comes for a visit and expressly states how
dearly she loves a chicken, as a table
delicacy when she knows just what that
chicken has been eating. Their hired
man Is 4 gemâ a character with a lop
sided stomach . that cannot be balanced
with any amount of wholesome fqod. but
must receive a certain quota of raspberry
pie to be put in a perfect state of equi
librium.
Later this hired Jewel becomes - -a man
of wrath for a day and then "jumps his
Job" to go to town and .find the editor of
the agricultural stuff that Mr. Carton has
been writing incognito. This transforma
tion is brought about through the perver
sity of the landlordâ Peter Waydean.
1 Peter catches a Carton chicken in the
Waydean green pea patch, plucks the bird
and then allows it to return home with
out even the dignity of a tail feather to
its name. This so enrages the hired man
that he in turn makes captive a maraud
ing Waydean pig and decorates it with
bonnet, pants, boots, wax and chicken
â¢feathers. Carton is driving Aunt Sophy's
prospective bridegroom home in the best
family rig and with the best family horse
when they bump into the procession of
Waydean cursing , and chasing this ap
parition of a hog. The family horse runs
away and breaks from the shafts just as
the buggy is in the middle of a river.
Carton has to wade ashore and carry his
guest in his arms. That is enough for
the hired man; especially aa the pig runs
into a funeral farther down the road and
the mourners are looking for the ' cos
tumer. He does not think that he can
stand further mental strain and leaves.
Another characteristic bit is the descrip
tion of Carton, the Â¦writer of agricultural
articles and wise man*, when he goes forth
to buy a cow. He' has brought his pur
chase home; has tried to milk the cow
and failed: has tried to feed the calf and
had his fingers chewed; has finally turned
the calf and cow out together and then
been obliged to chase them as they flee
down the road. His friend,, the butcher,
with whom he has only that morning had
long discussions on cowology, helps him
stop the bovine flight. Then comes the
denouement: . .Â¦
Carton, wife and child arrive at the
ranch after dark. Here is what they
find:
They take the place without the fifty
acres and with the one hundred dollars
extra. Their next trouble comes in mov
ing. Carton Is an inventive genius and
works out an elaborate system of num
bering his boxes to match a diagram of
rooms and similar numbers that he gives
to the expressman. The expressman is
so pleased with the arrangement that he
pay? he will set up the kitchen stove and
all the beds free of charge.

remarks as he pyrated from the *nd of the
chain were moet- abusive.. The epithets were

to let him stay where he was. "Keep cool, l

we understood the proper way to. pet off. for
there was a surprising thud, and I saw that

the eround and squared up to me.
"Now." he said, with vicious determination.
"I'm going: to settle with you."
The matter !s arranged, however, with
out blows and Carton succeeds in renting
the house and immediate yard for a year
for $100 more than is asked for the whole
plac-. which includes all this and in ad
dition fifty acres of farming land. This
1p explained by the landlord with farmer
like logic:
"Certainly, ma'am." he responded: "but how
far'd a hundred dollars go in wages for Mred

I couldn't afford to take them fifty acres off
your hands at that flgrure. Of course. I'd sooner
ycu took the hull place at three hundred, then
as much more would hire you a man, and if
Mr. Carton looked after him pretty sharp there
might be enough crop to feed your horses ar.d
cow. and he wouldn't have to spend more than
a thousand dollars in stock and implements to
start with."

The Bowen-Merrill Company of Indian
apolis are issuing an annotated and com

editorial supervision of Edward Dowden,
LiU. D. Two volumes are already from
the press, "The Tragedy of Hamlet" "and
"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet."
Judging from, these this edition Â¦ ls one
that should â¢ appeal to all lovers of

work is concerned, nothing could be more

The Dowden Shakespeare.
This book. has more of the Filipino In it
than any other work of fiction that has
as yet come to our notice. It is well
worth buying and deserves a place on any
list of approved books for summer read
ing. (Price $1 25.)
j Several of the stories are particularly
noteworthy. "The Fifteenth Wife" is one
of the most powerful, although its ending
may prove a shock to delicate nerves. An
other good one is "The Spirit of Mount
Apo," which recounts . the adventure of
the writer upon attempting to. climb a
mountain said, by the superstitious'na
tives, to be haunted. "Told.at the Club"
is the best .one of the "antingr-anting"
stories. In it is given an account , of a
clubman's conversion to a faith, in the
powers of an "antlntr-antirg" stone to
foretell coming â¢ disaster.
One of the tales recifes the desertion of
an American from the. ranks of his coun
trymen to those of the Filipinos and his
subsequent return, through his mother's
influence, to sacrifice himself that he may
save his countrymen and redeem his sul
lied honor. This seems to be a favorite
theme among writers of island fiction, for
Frederick Palmer, in "The Ways of the
.Service." had a similar story. It must be
said, moreover, that Mr, Palmer's was
the better of the two. - '
"Mr. Kayme writes, for example, in the
"Pearls of Sulu," of the "macasla" fes
tivalâthe remarkable fishing expedition
when a concoction of weeds and herbs is
thrown into the water and. the fish become
eo stupefied that they, can be caught by
hand. He tells of a whole meal served,
sufficient and palatable, aridi yet nothing
but bamboo ls used in the doing. He
brings but constantly bits of interesrtlng
customs and all without sacrificing the
dramatic interest of his story. . \
The book comprises eleven short stories
of life among the Filipinos. All of them
have a certain dash of adventure; some
of them border on the mystical, and from
each there can be derived, unconsciously,
a certain amount of romantic informa
tion; that is, from the pictures of the pi
rates, the natives, the pearl fishers, the
queer animals. These stories are good
reading in two different lights: First, as
romance for the excitement of a good
story; second, as a glimpse through the
eyes of one who has seen into the life of
this most Interesting and unreal country.
For the greater part Sargent Kayme
has some good stories to tell In his re
cent book just publisbed by Small. May
nnrd & Co., Boston. The name "Aiiting-
Anting" will appear as Greek to most
people, but it is really quite simple when
you understand. The editors have this to
say in explanationâ though â¢ the- meaning
cf, the term becomes perfectly clear, as it
plays Its part ;n the stories svHIeh.follow ;
the,? foreword. Â¦_ Â¦ -â¢ j. ....
"Strangest,. perhaps, of all these possN
bilities for fiction is trie anting-anting, at^
once, a mysterious power to protect- its
possessor and the outward symbol of the
protection. No more curious fetich can
be found in the history of folk-lore. Â¦'. A
button, a coin, a bit of paper with unin
telligible words scribbled, upon it, a bone,
a stone, a garment, anything, almostâ
often a thing of no intrinsic valueâ Its?
owner has been known to walk up to the
muzzle of a loaded musket or rush upon
the point of a bayonet with a confidence
so sublime as to silence ridicule and to
command admiration, if not respect."

rising of the Shawnee Indians In the

the war. and chiefly with the effort made
by General William Henry Harrison to
restrain the uprising in the Maumee Val

Wabash. under the great Shawnee chief,
Tecumseh, and his one-eyed- brother,

history, with events preceding the settle

of Tecumseh. who, with his brother, the
prophet, sought to unite all the Western
tribes in a confederacy that should pro
tect them from the intruding whites. The
project was defeated by the battle of Tip
pecanoe, though it brought about an alli
ance between the Shawnee chief and his
warriors and the English In Canada,
which alliance, however, cost Tecumseh

Edwin Asa Dix, whose new novel, "Old
Bowen's Legacy." is proving reminiscent
of his "Deacon Bradbury" to so many
readers, has lately been drawn aside for
a few months from the paths of fiction
by- the preparation of an elaborate book
to commemorate the twentieth-anniver
sary of the graduation of his college class,
the class of 1S81 at Princeton. The bock,
which was printed privately for the class,
is a costly volume of over 400 pages,
copiously illustrated, and with biographi
cal or autobiographical accounts of every
one of the class's 148 members and ex
members. â¢ Work on a book of this nature
is purely a labor of love, as of course no
financial profit attaches to'it. At the re
cent. reunion and. dinner held in Princer
ton, the class showed its 'appreciation of;
Mr. Dix's labors by presenting him with'
a magnificent Filver loving cup, over ten"
inches high, bearing a cordial inscription,
and with a picture of Old Nassau Hall
finely etched upon the silver.
Brentano's have for early publication a
work by H. B. Irving, entitled "Studies of
French Criminals of the Nineteenth Cen
tury." The author of -this book will, be
remembered as having -written "The Life
of Judge Jeffries," which attracted un
Â«usual attention about two years since.
Mr. Irving (son of Sir Henry Irving, the
famous tragedian) has given several
years* close study to the annals of crim
inal jurisprudence. This collection has
been gathered from the French criminal
records, and are studies of real culprits
whose guilt In almost every instance 'was
beyond suspicion of doubt; they are pre
sented as studies of character as well as
examples of the administration of crim
inal Justice in France. The author thinks
they might be of interest or value to those
who look up human documents for speci
mens of character as it actually ls. The
book . will doubtless -receive great atten
tion both in England and America.
The editor of the Western Magazine has
a good sound plank In the platform of
his policy. He says: "The mission of tne
Western Magazine Is to spread abroad tne
story of the glory of Edenlc California,
and the most ambitious desire of Its pub-
Usher is that its success shall be com
mensurate with its value to the State and
the benefits it yields to its patrons." In
this connection there is' an article on
"Summer Days Along Shore in Califor
nia" in the current issue that shows he is
In earnest. Another paper of merit and
interest is one describing "A Society
Function in Alta California." wherein la
given an account of the marriage of Gov

next Issue promises to be of special inter

The Observer In Tho 'Literary Era for

adopted words.
"A curious speculation might be started

to-morrow. The accident of the Transvaal
'war brought toto our 'daily speech a-Tnum

'tgln; such as "kopje' and Veldts which
previously had -found meager toleranco

plement to Webster's Dictionary, issued
about six months ago, opened wide Its
doors to a large number of these. The
Century, the Standard and other diction
aries, of course, do not contain tho major
ity of them. The popularization of grolf
and of bridge whist has Invited lexico
graphical sanction to a number of verbal
barbarities. Science almost daily spawns
novelties of nomenclature, which may or
may not be fecundated through the gen
eral lust for exact expression. Slang, the
garbage of speech, often possesses the fer
tilizing Qualities of the manure heap. So
it will be seen there are innumerable av
enues of all sorts through which new
words may arrive to knock at the portal
of the dictionary.
"Talking of slang, here is an American
word that is something like half a century
oldâ it occurs in HaUburton, If I am not
mistakenâ and is of widespread txse among
Uncle Sam's nieces, yet has received no
recognition from any authoritative dic
tionary issued In America. I refer -to
'conniption fit.' Bartlett's 'Dictionary of
Americanisms* has a short entry- under
this head. So 'has Murray's great Eng-

A. M. ROBERTSON.Â¦ He listened, with his kind, thoughtful
eyes upon me, and he looked very grave
though his first words were kind.
"She is indeed a sweet girl," he said,
and then he thought a little.
"It does not seem to me that there Is
any adequate motive for a deception on
this young lady's part. I think it would
be kinder to question her on the point."
"Oh, yes â yes!" I said,
"I do not see why a perhaps foolish but
quite innocent construction. should not be

And I, I have written and published a
great many stories, and had a full big
sort of life, with Helen for my friend.
There is a railway to Mirehurst. and
it is all over little villas.
But when the nightingales sing, and the
daffodils are out. I think of the dear,
dull old times, before thera were any
changes, and I wonder If I "have- evÂ»r
been us haoav slnra.
old clothes an 1 new materials down to
Kitty's, and we planned and consulted
and contrived, and Helen had lovely Ideas
for everything, fe.ie had read so much,
too, and was so sympathetic. I showed
her my storyâ the storyâ which was grow-,
ing slowly, pretty much as I grew, and
she made good criticisms, and . could tell
me just the practical things which are so
puzzlingâ such as what makes a will
valid, and what you call a bishop if you
want to speak to him. She was quite a
woman of the world.
The first thing that began the trouble
was that a friend of Mr. Crofter'sâ have
I said that 'May's name was Crofter
came down for the night, and â¢ said to
May:
"Oh, I see that you have that pretty
Miss Benson staying in the village."
"Not Miss Benronâ MIs3 Carteret," said.
May. "She's a lady dressmaker."
Well, It was very hard to convince him
It was not Miss Benson, and when he was
gone, and they mentioned it, Helen; did
look very odd. She turned quite pale,
and said likenesses were curious things:
The next thing was that Miss Jones,
who is a horrid gossip, said that she had
seen Helen In Hazelbridge copse talking
to a young man. She knew her hat, she
said. â¢
We all declared that we should not
think of telling Helen anything so ridicu
lous, and Just then the Rector asked us
all to tea, and tc see his tulips in flower.
We went. He -was always very kind,
and we were fond of him, but with Helen
he was more than a dear old thing; we
saw that he was a fine, courtly gentle
man, and her -way with him was lovely.
He 1 showed her all his pictures and books,
and she looked at them and talked about
themâ just In the right way. We all liked
her better than ever, and we went home
and worked on our colored muslin dresses
for the bazaar.
All this time 1 felt In an odd way as If
Helen was specially, my property. We had
more to say to each other. Dear Kitty
Clever talked much except about things in
the village, and May was very decided in
â¢ her opinions, and thought It wrong to ad
mire any book that was not just on the
lines which we all thought correct. But
Helen had rea-1 a great many other things
and she made one think, and to be made
to think, to have new thoughts given to
one, is the greatest of all delights when
one Is young.
One day I went into Hazelbridge copse
to see. if ..the. bluebells .were out. .. The
stalks of the primroses were pretty long,
and the trees got greener every day.
The nightingales were singing like mad.
Mirehurst was a lovely place In spring. â¢
As I came up to the dell where the. blue-'
bells opened, first, there I saw Helen.'
standing under a young beech tree, andâ
yesâ there was a strange young man by
her sideâ a tall', handsome fellow he was.
They were standing close together, and
talking very earnestly. I stopped short,
and then, I don't know if -I did right or
notâ but I turned and ran away. I could (
not force, myself on H'-len's. secrets,, and
I did not mean to betray, them; but I felt
sure that we should hear nothing of her
friend. " . . :,
It felt very strange when I went down
But she never said a word about the
young man. And . then somehow the
doubt grew. , Mr. Crofter's friend, It ap
peared, wrote to say that he was quite
sure that the girl we called Miss Carteret
was. really Miss Benson, that she lived
with her.mother in South Kensington, and
hid been daily governess , in a family he
knew." There ; was ! nothing against her,
but she was certainly going under a false
nameâ which /was odd.
And Miss Jones- saw- that young man
again on the same day that I saw him.
She su.sv him go-lnto the .wood and cuma
noons at half-past 2. Ten shillings ths set.
Could we?"
"We should have to go^without dinner. 1
Wo couldn't be at all certain of the Arab
doing it in two hours. We ought to allow
three with putting him up at the Crown."
The Arab was the donkey's name. It
was "spoke sarcastic." He, too, was joint
property. He belonged to my mother.
The cart was Kitty's and the turnout was
kept in a stable at May's house.
"But he would be quite sure, if we came
away at half-past 4, to get home in time
for high tea at 7.' That's all that mat
ters."
To make a Ions story short, we went.
We could do commissions in Longford at
the same time. There was a Longford
carrier came out on Thursday; you or
dered things one week and he brought
them to you the next. So if you wanted,
say, a pound of sausage ,on a Friday you
could not have It till Thursday weekr- The
postman brought over small parcels for
twopence each. It was before the parcels
post, and we never ordered anything by
letter. I don't know why. Dressmaking
classes were quite a novelty, and cookery
and ambulance ones had just been heard
of. New ideas were stirring in the air.
We began to ask each other if we should
like to "be anything," but on the whole
we admired ourselves for being content
with our own village. And I would write
stories and I thought of putting them In
print.
Miss Carteret was a tall, thin girl, with
straight eyebrows, bright, gray-blue eyes
and quantities of brown'halr. She was
very well dressed, and she was a brilliant
teacher. We knew a little about teaching
â we had to do it. May got up her facts
by heart, Kitty taught out of a book, Iâ
well, I came of a line of teachersâ and. It
like Professor Owen I was a "bone
ahead" of my'class, I managed. But we
had neVer been really taught, and it set
us all on tire. We "dress made" at every
spare minuteâ and though there were
three wet Wednesdays and the Arab took
advantage of the mud 'to be slower than
usual, we went every week. Once we
lunched at the Blacks' and met Miss
Carteret, and felt her to be a new sort'
of being. We thought her dress a little
too tasteful, her eyes a little too stea'dy
and her manners almost too free from
awkwardness, but wo thought and talked
of no one else but the Lady Dressmaker.
For she did dressmako as well as teach.
Sometimes she "went out to work," as
she called it, and then, she said, she "had
very good times."
Oifr own dressmaking quite ceased to
give us any satisfaction. May was ai-'
ways turning . Kitty and me around and
criticizing "the set of our -backs," and
Kitty, who had always made up neat
bows for trimming all exactly alike, quite
even and with a great many stitches, tried
one with one of its leers longer than the
other, and didn't like it.
Then 1 had another idea.
"Suppose," I said on the fourth Wed
nesday on which the Arab took us in to
Longford, "suppose we could get MIs3
Carteret to come out and stay with us
for a* fortnight and' do up our thfcigs.
She might come in with us to the classes."
"Nora! .What a first-class notion! But
where should she stay?"
"Well, there'd be more time at Kitty's
if our boys came home for Easter. Would
your mother, Kit â ?"
Mrs. Kestrell, Kitty's mother, always
had things pretty and nice. They had a
sweet little spare room.' I used some
times to .wish . I could go' away to live,
and come back and stay in it, and as she
was very indulgent and kind most of our
experiments .were, tried at the cottage.
We rushed in upon her, and propounded
member his coming to Mirehurst, but he
came there alone. The people were very
fond of him. and he knew them all very
well; but nobody could say that we were
a "highly organized" parish, and when
we went to school treats or choir festi
vals In the neighboring parishes our feel
ings were hurt because we had so few
new plans at work at Mirehurst.
However, as we always said, we did
what we could. There never was any
thing like a squabble in our parish, and
everybody was glad when the rector, in
his shabby old coat and hat, dropped in
upon them. Sometimes, indeed, he went
up to see the Bishop or to visit at the
X*ark, and then he wore a tall hat and a
coat of such beautiful smooth, glossy
cloth as I never see any one wear now.
Then no Archbishop could have looked
more ecclesiastical. He had been at col
lege with Lord Fayhurst, who gave him
the living; they were friends. Altogether
he' belonged to the "county"â there was
no mistake about that.
We didn't exactly. Kitty's cousins did
in another countyâ but. her mother was a
widow, and they lived in. Mirehurst be
cause it was cheap. May was the doc
tor's eldest daughter, and my father was
Loru Fayhurst's agent,' and I had five
brothers at schoolâ so, though of course
we knew the Ladies Gresham and the
Slnclairs at High Court and went to their
garden parties and now and then to a
Christmas dance, for real comfortable
equal companionship we had nobody but
each other.
"I'm sure. May," I remarked, "you be
gan to come to church In a hat because
Lady Lucy did. Every one must copy
some one. We shouldn't like loud looking
things ourselves and if our new things
are pretty enough to be noticed, if I was
Kate Lee or Bessie Canton, I'm sure I
should copy them.'*
"That's one of your wild ideas, . Nora,"
paid May. "It's quite different. Of course
the village girls will imitate us, and I do
think the Homo Farm girls get them
selves up ridiculously. So, as I say, we
should be quiet and correct."
"I think the Home Farm girls get very
pretty things." said Kitty. "In spite of
the Queen and paper patterns It's awfully
hard to make a dress nicely."
"It takes up so much time," said May.
"Grace Curtis Is worse than no good,"
I said, "and Miss Lowe at Longford is so
expensive."
"We shall really want some nice things
this summer. Besides the usual garden
Iiarties, there is to be the Duncnmbe
Ba?.aar and Fred Sinclair's coming of
age," said Kitty.
We were silent. I remember that an
early nightingale stepped into the breach
and sang madly against a background of
rooks, hawks and wood-pigeons. Those
sweet noises make my heart thrill now
adays, but then they were so natural that
I hardly noticed them. Waggy, our ter
rier puppy, barked at the nightingale.
Waggy ought to*have been a Skye, but he
wasn't. He had a lovely face, but his legs
were too long, and his tail curled like that
of a pig. Waggy lived at May's home. I
adored him. and he preferred Kitty, and
generally "boarded" round: so. like most
other thincs. he was really "ours."
"I've got an idea," I said suddenly. *i:.J
"1 thought you had, you looked so
silly," said Kitty. .
"Is It a new trimming?" said May. "or
a new story?" (I made up stories some
times.) '
"It's neither. There are' going to be
twelve dressmaking classes at Longford.
Why shouldn't we go in the donkey cart?"
"Look here." I went on, the idea devel
oping, "Gertrude Black sent me the pros
pectus. The teacher Is a Miss Carteret,
a lady dressmakerâ that's a new thing,
you know.. They're on Wednesday ufter-
'â¢Copyrlght In the Unites states of Amer
ica by D. T. Pierce.)
fTvHERE were three of us. The date
I of this story is in the dark ages.
1 before bicycles were in fashion, and
I when the railway only came as far
JL as Longford; and in those days,
'hen you were eight â¢ miles from the
rarest town i-nd a mile and a half- off
je high road, you had to stay a good
deal where you were put.
There were, as I began by saying, three
of us In Mlrehurst. There were only
t.iree, by which I mean to say, only three
of us on the same social level, for though
we all visited at the Park and knew the
Ladles Gresham, they did not count for
much in our lives, and besides were often
away. To the farmers' daughters and
.- .e village people, of course, we did
pood. â¢ ,
We three, then, were sitting on the stile
outside Cooper's Wood, talking about our
eprir.g clothes. For It was a cold, sun
ehiny day in April, and we had been
picking primroses and anemones. Of
course when there are only three of you,
and you see each other every day, you
talk over everything. We thought that
there was nothing to do, but then we had
to do everything there was. We taught
the Sunday-school, we decorated the
church and managed the 'choir and looked
after the parish. We trimmed each oth
er's hats, and Invited each other to go
for long walks. Sometimes we took each
other into Longford in the donkey cart.'
We tried experiments in making cakes,
and asked each other to tea to 'eat them.
We read each other's books, and all our
Ideas were common property.
We were very dull, that is, we thought
bo, but sometimesâ nowâ on a spring day
â¢when the light lasts long, and the air
blows cold, and primroses are being sold
in the street, I feel half inclined to alter
the old proverb and say, "Oh, the amus
ing old days when we used to be dull!"
I've never talked as much, nor laughed
as much, nor taken euch a wild interest
in my life as I did then. One or other of
us used sometimes to t=igh for a. "great
friend." We didn't know we were "great
friends" to each other. We were only
companions. I don't know if we were like
sisters, because I never nad a sister, but
we were certainly like schoolfellows,
quarrelsome and affectionate, and crit
ical, and intimateâ as girls are at school.
I don't think either of us sighed for a
lover. We all expected one in due time,
and May. the eldest of us, was only 21â
while Kitty and I had not long turned 19.
*'Ilats are going to be trimmed high,"
said May. "I have seen It In the Queen.
But we mustn't have ours too showy, and
sot a bad example in the village."
May was a very proper pirl. She al
ways thought about appearances, and
was really our Mrs. Grundy. Kitty was
rather slow and lazy, but then she was
eo comfortable you could always fall
back on her and she was never cross or
in a hurry. May always said that though
I had ideas, 1 never knew how to carry
tlicm out. Somebody, however, must be
gin thinking, and I don't believe that
without me she and Kitty would have
had so much to carry out. It was I who
thought of having a working party for
the girls who had left school â though
Kitty cut oup th* work and May looked
them up and read aloud at the meetings.
I knew they did it; but they never would
have done it without me. And everything
that began to happen on that day when
we eat on the stile began with me. And
as I had the blame I may as well have
the credit for it.
The reason why we had so much "say"
In the parish was that our rector. Mr.
Courtland. was elderly and a widower
with no children. None of us could re-
the Idea, and rhe came Into It without
difficulty. She "thought it was a very
good plan." My mother and May's made
110 objection, so Kitty wrote a note to
Miss Carteret, asking her to come back
ivlth us on the next Thursday, and she

to Kitty's for our afternoon work. I
knew something that I did not" mean to
tell her and May. I knew they would
think that I oufcht to have .told them;
but I simply could not.
Helen was there, looking just as usual.
She was not a bit conscious or confused,
whereas I could not" help blushing and
forgetting what I was going to say, till
May said:
"What is the matter. Nora? You look
as if you had a secret. Has the Rector
told you something about the parish tea?
lie could not mean you not to tell us."
"I don't know anything about the par
ish tea," I said. "What nonsense!"
"Do you tell ' each other everything?"
a?ked Helen, as she measured the distance
lor the frills on May's skirt.
"We've never had anything much that
we didn't want to tell, except, of course,
about birthday presents and things of
that sort," said Kitty.
"We shouldn't tell any one else's
secrets," I said emphatically.
"I'm sure you're a "loyal little person,
Nora," said Helen, "but I hope you'll
never have secrets to keep or to tell,"
out of it, and she saw Helen come out by
herself afterward. '

about being sorry, but that was all. and
Helen went out of the room. I ran after
her, and she threw her arms around me

â¢way, then fied upstairs to her own room.
I heard May and Kitty coming, and I
ran away down behind the raspberry
canes and cried by myself.
Oh dear, was my beautiful Helen an
indeed? We had read one
or two novels about fascinating '"adven
turesses," but I at' least had never real
ized that these superlative beings were
ma.de of flesh and blood. . .
I believed with all my heart In Helen's
self, in her eyes, in her tears. In all her
/rank, girlish talk â and yetâ and yet â a
false name, and secret meetings with a
young man? What could account for
these?
Helen would go. and we should never
ece her again; there would always be u
dreadful memory left. I felt that I
should never be able to wear any of the
dresses ' over which we had laughed and
worked together, and that somehow I
should never like our innocent girlish .life
in the same way again.
I cried bitterly and I prayed for Helen.
I was always the naughtiest of us three.
I did not oay unfailing attention in
church as May did, and I had tempers
that never disturbed Kitty, but I did pray
then with all my heart, and I felt that
there was some one to hear me.
Suddenly an idea darted into my mind.
I would go and tell the Rector. If thera
was a way of mercy anywhere he would
find it. Indeed, we often thought him'
much too kind. He would let naughty
children go to the school feast when we
thoughf it most injudicious of him to
overlook their bad behavior. But, some
how, now, I felt that in that large mercy
there was hope. And he- was wise, and
a man who knew the world and could
judge. /
I ran out at the side gate of Mrs. Kes
trell's garden and hurried along the lane
to the rectory. Perhaps the Rector was
in the garden, and, sure enough, there
he was, walking along by his tall hedge,
in his long shabby coat and soft hat, his
fine old head bent a little, and his hands
behind him.
Somehow he looked lonely.
1 did not wait to be frightened; I ran
up to him anil said:
"Please, Mr. Courtlar.d " and the
words would not come.* |
He took me by the hand and led me to
the seat under the lilac trcea. and then I

looking as none of us had ever seen him
look before.
"Mrs. Kestrell," he said. "'It Is I who

"And then," said Helen as he paused,
"when I found out who my- grandfather

would try. But, of course, I did not

"Mrs. Kestrell couldn't help suspecting

confusion of kissing, and explaining, and
wonderingâ and Iâ 1 went right up and

was, and that he> was tne happiest of us

"And now," he said, "Helen and I will

SOME SECRETS
LOST LONG AGO
ish on his gibbet.â London Spectator.
P=ir=3HE duel, which we associate espe
1 > daily with France and Italy, was
]> probably derived from the barbarous
north. Nor did it at the outset touch
the point of honor. It was rather an ap
peal from the judgment of a man to the
judgment of an all-wise Providence. The
ordeal by duel, In fact, was a rough-and
ready kind of justice with divine sanc
tion. If a man had been wronged by his
neighbor he challenged him to mortal
combat, he accepted the result without
question, and if death did not accompany
defeat the gallows awaited the miscreant
who was worsted in the fray. And, as be
came an affair of justice, the duel was
solemnly arranged and solemnly attended.
The King, who permitted it, commonly
witnessed it with all his court, so that it
was often a stately pageant. Such a duel
took place in 1540 between the Baron
d'Aguerre and the Lord of Fendillea.
Henri II of France forbade it. but the
Duo de Bouillon granted the lists in his
own country and the battle took place at
Sedan. The cause of the quarrel is imma
terial, and the duel is chiefly remarkable
for the truculence which Inspired the Lord
of Fendllles to prepare a gibbet and a fire
for his adversary when he should have,
vanquished him. But pride had its fall,
the Baron d'Aguerre was victorious, the
gibbet was never used and we are left
with a strange comment upon the man
ners of the fifteenth century. More re
markable still, because it lies outside the
rules of chivalry, was the fight between
two tailors. These persons, two common
journeymen, were not permitted any oth
er weapons than wooden clubs and trian
gular shields, and were compelled by
strict ordinance to fight to the .death.
As they entered the lists they cut an odd
figure. They were shaved and barefooted.
Their nails were pared and their leathern
clothes were tightly sewed upon them. Be
fore they began, to fight they demanded
grease, wood ashes and sugarâ grease for
the besmearing of their garments, wood
ashes that their hands- rnight be better

BEAUTY HINTS
Been but two summers. .
It was true that they must fight life's
battles alone. One revelation Jones made
to his wife at parting was he was
penniless, the residue of his Ill-gotten
gains having teen spent In preparing a
defense that proved faulty. Soon after
the period of his Incarceration commenced
the home was sold to pay attorney fees,
and the belated family came to San Fran
cisco. Then the struggle really began.
For five years Mrs. Jone3 has lived In
humble quarters , and eked out an exist
ence for herself and little ones. Through
her efforts the elder children are being
educated, and when not at school they
render assistance In supplying for them
selves the necessities of life. The strain
has left telling marks on the health of the
noble woman, and tho children, more than
any one else, knew what the result might
be. The repeated efforts of their father's
friends to secure his release were all for
naught, and they had almost reconciled
themselves to the Inevitable of seeing
him languish In prison until the law's will
was done. The announced visit of McKIn
ley gave the first ray of light to dispel the
disheartening gloom.
They had heard of the executive's phil
anthropy, and reached for the tender spot
In his heart. By reputation he was a good,
kind man. and he certainly could not be
deaf to the pleadings of four little ones
made fatherles3 by the arm of the law.
Long before the Presidential party ar
rived the petition was prepared. It was
read and re-read, altered and dressed in
terms that would best express all that
they wanted to tell of their miserable
lives and of the sunshine tnat awaited
them If th.elr prayer was heard. The doc
ument was the work of the eldest daugh
ter. Kthel. now 15 years of age. She told
of the struggle that had continued In the
home since the "Warden took Its bread
earner away. In touching language she
spoke of her mother's health, and con
cluded with this .sentence:
"If you don't let father out we will soon
have no mother."
At times they wondered If an opportu
nity of seeing the great President would
ever present Itself. The Illness of Mrs.
McKlnley and the lnfrequency with which
her husband appeared on the streets al
most tempted them to Intrust the paper to
some one who had the President's ear.
They knew it was impossible to secure an
audience at the Scott home, and oppor
tunities seemed dwindling away. Chief of
Police Sullivan, they thought, might ba
asked for assistance, but when the dark
angel receded from the sick woman's cot
they concluded that little Rodney should
at least make an attempt to present the
petition himself.
The lad, when he was not selling papers
at Sutter and Kearny streets, watched
for a chance. He lingered near the Scott
home and followed the carriages wherever
the President went. For a time he met
with no success. He was not quick enough
or he was held back at too great a dis
tance to accomplish his mission.
On the afternoon of the Knights Tem
plar parade Rodney, lingered near the Pal
ace Hotel. He saw the President's car
riage wait, and elbowed his way Into the
front rank of the crowd. "When McKlnley
was about to step Into the carriage he
broke through the lines and rushed to
ward him. The big policeman had not an
ticipated the move.
Looking up into the benevolent face the
lad held the petition in his outstretched
hand. The President took it. smiled and
thrust It Into his overcoat pocket. The
big policeman, having recovered from his
surprise. Jammed the youthful petitioner
back Into the crowd and the carriage
rolled away. But the boy was happy. He
thought he paw a reason to hope In Me-
Kinley's smile.
Weeks have passed and no answer in
the nature of official action has teen re
ceived. The mother and children toll In
the same old way and the father remains
in prison. The children wonder If their
supplication has ever been heard, or
whether it remains unread In the Presi
dent's overcoat pocket.
Four weeping babies watched him from
the doorway as he was led away: Ethel,
aged 10; Rodney, three years younger:
Enos, aged- 4, and Baby Jack, who had
In a comfortable home on the west side
of town lived the convict's family. Thith
er he went in company with Warden L.
O. Henderson of the Nevada penitentiary
to tell his wife and babies that they must
face the world alone for awhile and to bid
them adieu. Those of the sorrowing 1
household felt the parting keenly, for a
man never treated his family with more
consideration than did this husband and
father. The luxuries that had been af
forded by his stealings were distributed
at his fireside, and his spouse and children
were now willing to suffer his disgrace,
grant him forgiveness and give him an
assurance that, although behind prison
bars, he would always be in their hearts.
During the first trial the promised vin
dication did not come, but there was to
be another inquisition and, with it, an
other opportunity. The second trial only
served to strengthen 'the presumption of
guilt. The defense attempted to show
that inexperienced hands, had allowed the
precious metal to escape in solution. As
says were taken from the soil at the
mouth of the drain pipe, but the report
offered by the defense differed vastly from
that made by the povernment assayers.
Again it was offered as evidence that bul
lion had escaped with the smoke through
the flues. This was so apparently ridicu
lous that Sam Davl3, the humorist. In a
burst of witticism, painted word pictures
of "Golden Sunsets" and "Cloud3 with
silver linings," as gracing the Nevada
skies. The evidence pro and con > placed
the case In a condition that Jones' pre
vious good character alone remained on
his side of the balance. Had It been left
to a popular vote, even at that stage, the
unfortunate man would never have gone
to prison, but the Jury was Instructed to
judge according to the law and the evi
dence, and in doing so pronounced the
words of doom. One week later Jones re
ceived his sentence.
The first trial resulted in a disagree
ment. The people of the town sympa
thized with the man on trial, and every
consideration and assistance in the hour
of his embarrassment were extended him.
His promises we're unfulfilled. The
prosecution conducted by General Robert
M. Clark was built upon some sound
grounds. It was established that a short
age existed In the Mint and that it was
the result of theft. The methods of the
robbers were exposed, and even the par
ticular melts from which the gold had
been extracted were specified. Then the
accuser pointed his finger at the defend
ant, John T. Jones, and offered to the Jury
evidences of his Built.
During the progress of his trial Jones
maintained a demeanor of indifference
and reiterated to his friends his promise
that when given an opportunity he would
dispel the cloud of suspicion shading that
particular era of his life. He said he
would walk from the courtroom a free
man, exonerated and a hero because of
the humiliation and mental anguish
pressed upon him by bungling officials.
Shortly after Harris* incumbency orders
were received from Washington to con
solidate a number of melts that had been
stored for years in the vaults. They all
varied In fineness, and after the' new
metal bad been molded Into bars they
were chipped for assay purposes. The
deficiency in gold gave the official cause
for alarm. He consulted his trusted serv
ant, but always received the , assurance
that everything would be all right. A
general clean-up was made, the chimneys
were cleaned and the sweepings of . the
floors preserved. It was soon evident that
the loss had not been Incurred by waste,
and Harris made a report to his supe
riors. Andrew Mason, chief of the New-
York assay office, was dispatched to the
coast with instructions to probe the mat
ter to the bottom.
Hclted his advice In all matters, leaving
the management of the entire department
in his keeping and resting easy under
the confidence he reposed in his subordi

the nature of a sensatkm. John T. Jonws,
the assistant melter and refiner of the t
Mint, bon vivant fellow, was accused of j
theft and it was rumored that he was i
but the first of many to be taken into d
the toils. ]
What led to the detection of Jones was t
his reckless expenditure of money. Ho i
received a salary of but $200 a month, yet t
spent thousands in excess of that amount. Â¦.
He was a man of jovial dlspostilon, benefi- ]
cent and charitable, and when he told
the story that he had acquired his wealth s
by lucrative investments in stocks none i
hesitated in accepting the statement as '
truth. Before the shortage was discov
ered there was no reason to dispute him. *
Nothing had transpired that would give '
rise to any suspicions and his golden dol
lars continued to flow into the channels '
of trade, increasing his popularity and
bringing him into the roremost rank of
prominent citizenship.
Then came the news of the spurious
metal in the Mint. It was quickly traced
to the department of which he had al
most absolute supervision, the melter and
refiner being a sickly man who was
obliged to spend most of his time In San
Francisco under a physician's treatment
and who died during his term of office,
leaving his assistant to succeed him.
Doubt was then cast on the story of the
wealth-producing stocks.
The detectives made an examination of
the transactions in which Jones was al
leged to have made his money, but in
stead of reaping a gain for the Investor
they were shown to have incurred a loss.
The assistant was called to account fnr
his sudden flight to fortune. He came to
Carson a poor man and within four y.-ars
had limitless funds. The amount he spent
could not be estimated and there was still
a goodly sum to his credit in the banks.
Jones promised to explain, but failed to
offer anything of a satisfactory nature
and his arrest followed.

but 17% points of gold was left in each

At the annual inspection of the mints
the melts are placed on scales and if they

A bronzed color was given the spurious
bars by painting them with acid and after
a casual examination the inspectors had
no hesitancy in accepting them for what
they- purported to be in fineness. All this
was done under the regime that ened in

In the Mint. Hirsch Harris, a Genoa mer
chant, was given a political plum, * but
while he might have been proficient in
the disposition of his wares, his knowledge
of Mint affairs was limited to what he
had read of and heard about. He had had
no practical experience, and when Jones
offered to remain in the department as
his assistant he gladly accepted the prop
osition and set about to become acquaint
ed with his new duties. He cast the bulk
of the responsibility upon Jones and so-
and refiner's department, was also caught
in the meshes of the law and. the. i\vi
men were brought to trial several months"
later. Their methods in robbing the poiyi
ernment were systematic. Gold was ex
tracted from bars of bullion and silver

tection for a. number of years, and it waa
not until assays were taken that the din

"Walt and Bee."
TO most San FY&nclscans the visit
of McKinley meant little more than
an opportunity of seeing and wel
coming the chief executive of a
great nation. It meant parades and
fireworks and brass bands.
But out on Filbert street are four bright
laced children to whom the coming of the
august personage was a momentous
event. It afforded to them a great op
portunitj'âgreater perhaps, despite their
tender years, than may ever claim their
anxiety again.
Among themselves they had conceived
a plan that might open the gates of their
lather's prison cell. The restoration of
his freedom would bring happiness to a
darkened household, health and strength
to a repining mother and partially lift the
stigma that stalks in the wake of crime.
The four youngstersâ two girls and two
boysâ realized the advantage In McKln
ley's presence here. They had looked for
ward to it evrr since the first press dis
patches announced that the coast would
be so honored. For months hope alter
nated with fear In their hearts.
To claim the attention of the President
on matters pertinent to pardons they
knew to be difficult even with the mighty.
Men of influence had tried and failed.
Politician* arid friends had started the
wheel* of thÂ» machinery that could un
lock the doors almost as eoon as they had
closed upon their father, but five years
had now passed and the bars were stiil
up. wtth tittle prospect of coming down
until the court's Judgment should have
been exacted to the letter.
So thÂ« eon* and daughters of the Im
prisoned man resolved to try for them
selves. The oldest child, a girl of 15
years, tolling dally tn a factory, wrote a.
petition. Three more babies appended
their signature* below hers and Â« boy
who contributÂ«w to the family support by
celling newspapers waa chosen to pre
sent It. v â¢ - â¢
At this critical point of Ume the pros
pective visit Inspired the little ones with
hope. Washington was a long distance
off and communications werÂ« often lost
in the bulk of official matter. They ar
gued that if the prayer could bÂ« presented
by one of them in person they could rest
assured that thÂ« President would receive
It; but if It tt-ere trusted to the maila
ecme secretary. Ignorant of the 6ad urg
ency of the case, might pigeonhole or dis.
card it without notice. So when tha news
that the one invested with power to crush
or elevate their dream* would soon be
near where they might pee hie face anÂ»J
talk to him the great barrier seÂ«m*d re.
mov*d, and they worked to contuwmat*
their plans.
The petition was presented tÂ« McKInley
âplaced in his hands by the boy whos*
face bespoke Intense yearning. Put now
the little faces are again beginning tQ
wear the withering expression of disap
pointment and the old load is shifting
back upon their hearts. No acknowledge
ment. eave a single smile, has been re
ceived and the precious paper has not yet
been productive of reward.

An attorney rÂ»Â«?ruptÂ«>s a peculiar position.
Colonel Kowalsky Bays:
"The lawyer Is the most trusted and dis
trusted of men. The busy office over
â¢which he presides Is not a place of eun
sninft. The client never carries his pleas
ures or Joys to the lawyer; the only thing
he cornea with are sorrows and burdens,
troubles, trials and tribulations. The law
yer's life is anything but a peaceful one;
It Is constant contention. His clients nec
essarily confide to him. or rather should
confide to him, their innermost secrets,
and yet lawyers frequently say that cli
ents. In order to create a good impression
and to make their case seem substantial
and strong, add*a little romance and wink
at verity, thus ofttimes misleading them.
"The term of 'lawyer* In its practical
eense is generic. The branches of the law
are many axd varied, and, while lawyers
understand the general principles of law.
the law, like other professions, has spe
cial lines, and is . therefore fast passing

stood to mean one who argues well or who
is a great orator: but pleading means the
most important function that a lawyer can
performâ it is in the preparation of his
papers, to Ret himself fully and fairly into
court so that he can maintain and estab
lish his case; in other words, it lÂ« to cop,-
Etmct his case upon law so that his op
ponent cannot overcome him.
"Some are good equity lawyers; that
means, to use the technical term, lawyers
who deal with the equity side of the court,
or, to be more explicit. In the language of
the lawyer, the one who deals with that
class of cases where there Is no complete,
speedy or adeqTiate remedy at law, and
therefore the equity side of the court must
be resorted to.
â¢â¢Soire are called good Jury lawyers.
What is meant by that is that they have
gt>od diycercment and are capable of un
derstanding: human nature and are sener
aiiy correet In their judgments and in the
selection of the Jurors who are Impaneled
to try the cause. That, of course, carriei
with it that one Is necessarily rood at cxÂ«
sminfes his wUnesses and still better at
cross-examining his opponent's witnesses,
with the capability to present his cause
with vigor and energy before the Jury. He
must be logical, convincing and oratorical.
"Then there is the criminal lawyer, who
has much of the Â«ame qualities as the Jury
lawyer. There are many other divisions
In which the lawyer can be placed, but
this Is sufficient to choir the divergency of
this ereat profcssloa.
"For some reaaon. wtiÂ«thÂ«fr due to Jeal
ousy or not. the lawyer is usually dis
trusted by the average merchant; Just
why no satisfactory reason has ever been
ventured. There are many wealthy law
yers, yet the niercantile world attempts
to epedf y the lawyer as being a poor bvsi
ness man. and yet -when tbe business man
gets into trouble and cannot extricate
himself, he is forced to guhmit his busi
ness troubles to the very man whom. beÂ«

mR. THEODORE A. COOK, the old
Oxford Blue, writes of "The
Rowing World of Liondon" in an
â¢ article in Cassell's Magazine for
July. He says: "The root of the whole
business, to my mind. Is this training of
the younger men. It is no good, because
a few exceptional examples may be quot
ed, to say that any strong and healthy
man of two or three-and-twenty can pick
up rowing on a sliding seat without any
preliminary trouble. As a matter of fact,
almost aa much attention to detail, and
certainly quite as much practical expe
rience, is needed by the novice with the
oar as with the fencing foil. Rowing is
not a matter of mere slugging. Brute
strength will not move a light boac
through the water, even when she is
broader In the beam and six feet shorter
than the old models used to be. This has
rarely been so clearly proved as wheu
W. A. L. Fletcher of Oxford took up the
task of teaching Cambridge men the finer
points of rowing. Persistently, vigorous
ly, patiently, he drilled his crew until they
had mastered all the small but essential
details of rowing in good style, such as
the proper use of inside and outside hand,
the arching of the inside wrist, the Hat
swing back of the outside wrist to an un
cramped finish, the stead" balancing
swing, the arm-reach, the proper clip of
the beginning at full stretch, the instan
taneous spring and heave of the body
weight direct from the heels with a free
swing back, the elastic . release of hands
and body on the recovery. Even now I
have scarcely enumerated half the points
Â¦which go to make a perfect style, and. I
need hardly say that a first-rate oar does
neariy all of them unconsciously.
"Now, what does that involve? It means
that a series of artificial motions have to
be so ingrained in the fiber of a man that
at last he performs them instinctively and
without an effort to remember them. It
means also that the tyro who has never
held an oar before must be taught one
after , another, slowly and persistently,
and scarcely allowed to proceed to a new
motion beforo the last is so thoroughly

All this must be taught him in a craft
safe enough to banish from his mind any
possibility of her not keeping steady

on fixed seats. That teaches him the use .

to sliding seats in a tub. and so to sliding;

est possible care should be taken to erad
icate any faults before it is too late; for
the last step Â»s into a keelless cedar boat
with canvas fore and aft. in which every
error* is promptly paid for by personal
discomfort, and by loss cf general happi
ness that is shared by every member of
the crew. Unless these several stages are
carefully taken I believe no one can turn
out a good oar. Can every captain in the
best metropolitan clubs tell mo that hte
recruits go through them properly? "We
have a hot crew coming over from the
University of Pennsylvania for this year's
Henley, and other foreign entries may be
expected. These clubs are all as keen as
mustard on proving- the.mselves as good
as any English combination, and they
will do so, if not this year, then very
shortly, unless we wake up to the fact
that we are resting on our reputation and
that other countries are taking far more
trouble than we are to master the ele
ments of good rowing. The question
whether Great Britain's old supremacy
is to be lost in yet another sport ean be

Lawyers' fee3 sound not only large, but
exorbitant to most people, but In thesa
advanced day3 it is every man for him

Is as Mr. Kowalsky put it. 'The survival
of the fittest."
There are some lawyers who don't ask:
fancy prices when they might. Henry E.
Highton came here in 1S49, &i.d has dur
ing that time been mixed up with all ths
original railroad magnates â Crocker, Stan
ford, Hopkins and Huntlngtonâsome
times for and sometimes against, but his
largest fee never -went over $20,000. Yet
this man has a reputation for trying
more cases than any other man in this
State. From the Cole vs. Bacon suit ha
got $16,000 and from the Mussell Slough,
and San Pablo ranch cases somewhere In
the neighborhood of $10,000.
Judge Bindley is another high salaried
attorney. He keeps a watchful eye on the

cific gets $25,000 a year to prove that acci

man gets $15,000 from the Market-street
Railway Company for exactly the same
thing. As a rule, both of them have
something on hand, for somebody Is eter
nally and forever breaking his head.
There are lawyers who are making
money whether they work or not. In their
case it isn't "No work, no pay," but often
pay and little if any work. ,
But all lawyers, and eminently success
ful ones at that, don't make their for
tunes in a pile that way. For instance.
E. S. Plllsbury is providing for the fu
ture, but he is doing it a little slower.
He is considered one of the best corpora
tion lawyers on the Pacific Coast and hla
name pays a big interest. He la allowed
$6000 a year from "Wells-Fargo Company
and as much or more from the telephone
company. That shows a yearly Income of
$12,000 from two cllent3. and he has hla
hands full to overflowing. Certainly no
one could accuse him of losing money.

Edward F. Preston was born under a
lucky star. He has made heaps of money.
Perhaps one of the biggest fees came to
him through Mrs. Donahue. When her
brother, William S. O'Brien, died he left
her a million or so. She immediately ap
plied to Preston to bring suit for a di
vorce against, her husband. Her wealth
meant freedom, and she gave the man
who' secured It for her $200,000. But. as a.

came easily. He made many large Zees.
He got $150,000 from the Colton case, and
after his death, his estate was paid $130,

In five minutes from that time Hall Mc-
Allister and Mr. Jones were doing the
double quickstep for the train. Victory

up from Bakersfield, where he had been
teaching the fellows how to water land.
Incidentally, and merely to show how
forcible and thorough his training was,
he carried $Â£0,000 back with him. McAl

his brother lawyers as a very groat man.
If ever any of the bars in America pos
sessed an Individual whose capabilities
upon this subject were pre-eminently
complete tn every direction such Â«v man
existed at the head of thÂ« Callforntan
bar. The greatest all-round, lawyer th&^
California's history boasted of wt\* the
late' Hall McAllister, a man of gtant
physique and whose mentality was com
parable with the tremendous natural
force and positive, yet kindly, personal
ity thnt he possessed. McAllister was as
pood In the capacity of Â«flleo> lawyer as
ho was In delivering an argument before
Home tribunal and equally as pood tn a
civil cause as he was in defending a mur
derer. He was considered the loader of
this bar when he died, and It would be
difficult to suggest a name that would be
quite able to take his place.
"Mr. McAllister once said that he con
sidered lawyers the highest and best
type of manhood; that they lived by their
cwn mental exertions and efforts; that in
t'-.p days if nract'oe. v.'hen written
sx.^iuiatlcns were considered bad lorm,
the word of a lawyer was always suffi
cient; that the greatest temptation for
the lawyer to do wrong was usually tend
ered him by his client, and if the average
lawyer accepted his clients' suggestion. 0
he would find himself constantly in hot
water.
"Speaking of the shrewdness and
astuteness of> lawyers, the late John B.-
Felton said that they were the most eon
fldir.g of men and the most gullible. To
see a lawyer In court arguing a matter
or examining witnesses is accepted by the
average person as all the labor the attor
ney has to perform In r case. The lay
man knows nothing of the great prepara
tion necessary before the trial is had and
thÂ« great amount of work in preparing
motions and transcripts and all the im
portant work to which the lawyer Is com
pelled to devote his attention. The trial
is only an incident.
"There are nearly 2000 lawyers In Sar.
Francisco at the present time, but. all
men who graduated as lawyers do not
follow the profession. Many eligible
young m*n take the course In law just to
say they have a profession.
"It is here as elsewhere the case of the
â¢survival of the fittest,' and tn law as in
all other professions and businesses, you
find men who are not quite able to reach
the mark. It migrht be said that out of
the 2300 practicing attorneys here that
you could probably count the very suc
cessful ones within 100, although there
are any number who make a very good
living. The struggling young attorney Is
entitled to the world's sympathy, espe
cially if he has no flnanc'al backing. H ! s
obligations are many. He must dress
well, keep in good society, do nodal
dutiesâ all Just the same as his older
brother in tho law doesâ and all this
costs money. Unless he has a clientele
he is financially embarrassed."
But there are any amount of lawyers
who are not "financially embarrassed,"

Coming from such sources of au

The present interesting paper on

WHEN<a man dies mortals will
ask, "What property has he
left behind him?" But the an
gels will Inquire, "What good
deeds hast thou sent before
thee?" This thought prompted the or
ganization of the California Girls" Train-
Ing Home. The need of a home to shelter
girls too young to be sent to the State
Reform School and yet in need of disci
pline was brought forcibly to the minds
and hearts of some philanthropic ladles of
this city by a most pitiful case which
came up In one of our Police Courts.
A home was started on Hill street about
nine years ago, and bur work has pros
pered exceedingly. Five years ago we
found our house inadequate for the num
ber of girls, and we secured a building at
147 JCatoma street, which has been our
home since that time. But that house in
turn is rapidly becoming too crowded, and
we are working now to raise funds to
build a larger and more comfortable
borne.
A house with forty girls, and euch girls
es we have, cannot help but be interest-

flooded with applications for girls. It Is
Blmply. impossible to fill all demands, for
i we will not let a girl go out until she has
had the best training In every department
that the home can give.
The work of the house Is enforced If
need be by punishment. The girls do try,
and our matrons are often amused at the
way the older girls make the new ones
"toe the mark." Sometimes the girls re
bel against this discipline of work, but
It Is an excellent antidote', for stage
struck girls and we know we are fitting
them all for useful, independent lives.
We always. find places for girls who have
no relatives to go to when they leave us,

Our home, Is supported entirely by vol

depend almost entirely upon the gener
osity of our friends for a maintenance..

or parents who find them too wayward to
be controlled; often they have neither
guardians nor parents, and so have double
need of such a shelter as we offer. Some
times the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children finds our modest home
the place that they need for Â¦ their pro
teges.
Our girls are as happy as girls can be
who are deprived of their liberty, (or we
must of necessity deprive them until they
can be made to see the error of their way,
and inspire a desire for something better
than they have known. Our girls must
work- We are believers in the old proverb
that Satan finds mischief for idle hands,
and we know that wholesome work 'is
good for mind and heart. So we try to
teach the girls every department of house
work.
Our rising hour is 6:30 a. m. Before
breakfast, which Is at 7 a. m.. the g.rls
must get themselves dressed and "do out"
their rooms, which means sweeping and
cleaning and making the bed. Each girl
has her own little roomâ not half as nice
as we would like to make it, but it is her
own, and she can make it as pretty as
opportunity and desire dictate. But the
rooms, and. in feet, the whole house/must
be c'.tan, for we believe cleanliness next
to GodHnef-s, and girls cannot be taught
to keep some other body's house clean if
they can't keep their own so.
At 3 o'clock the girls assemble in the
schoolroom, where the regular work of the
public school is carried on until 12 m.
Some of our girls are unusually bright,
and we try to help them to the education
they dtsire.
Our laundry is one of the most Interest
ing places in the home. Here one head
girl with five assistants handles between
300 to S50 pieces of washing per week.
Here they are taught how to take the
various kinds of stain? out of clothing,
and to staich and rinse and blue and iron,
and when we say that we are proud of
our laundry and invite inspection it is all
that is necessary to be said.
Two girls do all the cooking for the"
home. How many housekeepers would

that the tables are carefully set, must
wash the dishes and wait on the tables.
In fact, they are held entirely responsi

cludes the matron's table.
There are blackboards and charts about,
and the girls learn why they do things as

BLOWING OF GLASS
TUBES 300 FEET
LONG.
AMOST Interesting account Is given
in the Idler of the wonderful etate
aided industry at Jena, where glass
and lenses are made for scientists.
The industry has been built up by Pro
fessor Abbe and Dr. Schott and has
throughout i been conducted by scientists
whose efforts have made Jena famous
among scientific men the world over. Ona
of the most picturesque features of the
Jena glassworks Is the great corridor
where the thermometer tubes are blown
and drawn.
We saw this glass In process of manu
facture. A boy workman caught a bit of
molten glass from the furnace on the end
of a blow-pipe. It was hardly larger than
a walnut, but. by twirling and blowing
and melding it, it grew to the size of an
orange, with the shape of an acorn. Mora
glass was then added, and there was
more rolling and blowing, and when the
proper stage was reached the blow-pipe
was passed quickly to the brawny master
workman.
He. In his turn, added glass, blowing
from time to time with cheeks outpuffed
until it seemed as though they must
burst, and then rolling the great ball of
glass on his iron kneading board until it
looked like a huge yellow gourd. Faster
and faster he worked, keeping the ball
always symmetrical and yet white hot.
At length he lifted the glowing mass
quickly in the air and a second workman
attached his blow-pipe at the bottom.
Then the two men ran In opposite direc
tions, twirlinc the pipes and blowing
lustily from time to time. From a thick,
portly yellow globe the glass thinned out
quickly as tne men ran a Part, until It
became a dull red tube not larger than a
man's little finger and nearly 300 feet
Ion?. Sometimes In blowing these tubes
one of the blowers would not only run
the length of the corridor, but far outside
on the hill-

CALIFORNIA GIRL'S TRAINING HOME-There'is a' handball tournament in pro
, gress. at the Olympic Club at the present
time. Those who have entered are M.
McGuire. T. Leach. G. Cunningham, Al
Collins. L. Kenny, W. Collins, F. Mulmer.
J..Mahoney, Joseph Collins, A. McVickar.
Ed Curley, A. C. Hampton, J. Hurley, J.
White, Joe Condon. W. Staff, T. Clement.
Ed Antos, T. J. Lydon and C. Sullivan.
These men represent both the Olympic
and the San Francisco clubs. The rivalry
existing between the organizations and
the handsome medals which have been of
fered will produce a lively Interest in the
tournament games. The tournament will
not be finished for some time, as the
games are scheduled for Monday. Wednes
day and Firday nights until the finals are
reached.
The two universities have jgone In for
the game, and before long there will be
Intercollegiate contests. During the spring
a regular class tournament was played at
the University of California and some
promising players were developed. A
committee has been appointed to arrange
for the building of a regulation court,
and this is expected to be a feature of
athletic equipment at the State Univer
sity. At present the California University
students play with the soft ball, the ten
nis variety, but with a new regulation
court they will certainly adopt the small
hard ball for all games. With university
teams in the field, general coast tourna
ments may soon become featural elements
in handball competition in this city. . .
may secure over the other the followers
of the defeated man will not concede su
periority to the victor for a moment.
Handball can be played at night as well
as during the day, for the y courts are
lighted by incandescent lights placed In
glass niches in the walls and ceiling. In
fact, the majority of the men playing
handball in this city make a night exer
cise of it. When the work of the day la
over and dinner has been eaten and di
gested that is the time when the courts
of the Olympic Club are crowded. The
tournaments as a rule are played at night
- Handball is used by the great majority
of players as an exercise. Besides the big
regulation court at the Olympic Club
there are two smaller courts, in which the
soft ball Is used: Here are to be seen the
"reducers," men who have grown stale
from lack of work and accumulated morÂ«
adipose than they can comfortably carry,
and the man of nervous temperament who
has been advised by his physician to in

act as an exhaust to his excess of nervoua
energy. Harry Ramsdell. Will Thornton.

The great rivalry is between the.Olym

of the San Francisco Handball Club. It
has been and will be an undecided ques

time to come. Both clubs are well repre
sented with the strongest players this city
has ever produced. Such men as Collins
of the San Francisco Club and Hampton
at the Olympic Club are hard to duplicate
anywhere. Hampton recently won a tour
nament at the Olympic, and. Collins came
out with flying colors at the San Fran

by Hampton as the best player on the
coast. In the Sen Francisco alley Coliins
and Jimmie White are the kings. It is
a nice question to decide, and no matter

AGAINST 'SOME .OF THE BEST
AMATEURS IN THIS CITY. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ ;
THE inroads that handball has
made en every other indoor game
has caused the old gymnasium de
votees to pull up with a quick stop
and ask themselves what the end
of it all will be. From all over the coun
try comes the cry that gymnasium work
among men Is rapidly declining and that
handball is taking the place of every
form of indoor athletic exercise. And so
it is. There ts no gainsaying the popu
larity of this game, not many years ago
practiced onJy by a few oÂ£ the old de
votees who knew something of . it from
the old country. .
From the number of young: men taking
part in the game to-day there seems
hardly to be the necessity of gymnasium
work. It is a game and gymnasium work
Is not, and for this very reason the pop
ularity of handball will not only con
tinue but will increase as facilities for
playing it are thrown open to those who
desire to enlist In the ranks of handball
players. In San Francisco there are sev
eral handball clubs, clubs that exist only
for the game, and they have developed a
number of players who are so far up in
the rating that It takes a genuine cham
pion to beat them. Prominent among
these two clubs are the San Francisco
and the Occidental. ' The Olympic Club,
by no means a handball club, seems to
have become one solely when viewed on
its athletic side.
There was a day when the young and
athletic Olympians knew what it :was to
test their speed and strength on the cin
der path. They were also gymnastsâ bar
performers and trapeze artists. Go up to
the Olympic Club now end see what you
w..i find in the way of active athleticism.
For every man Vhb does gymnasium
work-that is. work of the kind that is
not solely a physical exercise, but brings
for the performer something In the way

So far as can be seen at present more

The Alameda senior barge crew is ready'
to go, and the oarsmen in it will take part
in the single shell and outrlgged skiff
races and also in the double pleasure boat
contest. From the Dolphin Boating and
Swimming Club will go Alex W. Pape,
who will pull in the single shell and swim,
and Leo Wlenand, who will take part In'
the outriggfed skiff race. As Wienand de
sires to use the new Dolphin \ skiff, the
club has required him to deposit a sum
sufficient to guarantee it against loss or
damage. The South Ends have three men'
at least who are willing to go. These are
Maurice Cashman, J.. P. Foley and T. I.
Fitzpatrick. But it is not yet decided
whether a barge crew will be made up or
not. The Olympic Boat Club's junior
barge crew is training at the clubhouse
of the South Ends, and includes Charles
Melrose, Lester Hammersmith and R. B.
Cornell, who are all good swimmers, and
T. J: Sherry, who was second in the Junior
skiff race on Lake Merrltt. The Arfel
Rowing Club is ready to send a barge
crew and two single scullers, and the Lur
line Swimming Club has offered as many
swimmers as are wanted. As the Univer
sity of California has received its four

LOCAL OARSMEN
TO FAVOR ASTORIA
The new event of interest to the oars
men of San Francisco Bay Is the eighth
annual regatta at Astoria, which takes
place on August 29 and 20. John C. Mc-
Cue, secretary of the executive commit
tee and chairman of the committee on
shells and barges, was recently in this
city for several days, during which he
visited the houses of the various clubs.
The Astoria carnival will last three days,
but only the first two of these will be
given up to aquatic events, the morning3
being devoted to rowing and swimming
races and the afternoons to sailing con
tests. There will be contests in Â¦ four
oared barges and shells and .. in single
shells, outrlgged skiffs and pleasure boats.
As the oarsmen of Astoria, Portland, Van
couver and Victoria, all of whom will be
represented at the regatta, use four-oared
shells and have no barges or- outrigged
skiffs, the Astoria committee would like
to get as. many shell rowers and single,
scullers as possible from San Francisco
Bay. The committee also desires that the
men who pull "In barge -crews' should. If
possible,. be able to take part also in sin
gle sculling and swimming races. The
committee promises to provide free trans-,
portation on the steamers to Astoria and

"All aboard for Mill Valley, Mill Valley.
Mill Valley!" shrieks and shouts the blue
coated train hand.
Then comes i the final grand dash for a
seat. The swells going over for a
quiet little sail on a fine yacht cannot
Bhrink into a space, small enough to avoid
rubbing shoulders with the crowd bent en
eating: hard-boiled eggs and drinking beer.
"Fairfax, Fairfax! this train for Fair
fax!"- . .-I:'/- Â¦
These people are bent on forgetting
their dally labor, bent on having a good
time, and have it they will. With the ut
most -unconcern they calmly pace the
decks with arms Intertwined, hug- or
squeeze each other going over and coming
backâ one could easily call it a "kissing
bee." But. then. It . Is in the . air and ia
catchingâ it's a picnic, you know. .
The fellows seemed a little diffident, a
bit shy at first. Not so the girls. If there
Â¦were not enough men to go around they
danced with each other, while an admir
ing throng- clapped and cheered. Any
thing to danceâ anything and everything
to have a good time!
Dancing, as sure as I was a foot high!
A space was cleared and they were waltz
ing or two-stepping with sublime disre
gard to the music. Each man to his own
glides Jnto the bay laden down with.
Borne 2500 souls.
I heard music and loud laughter and,
curloslty-llke, followed It.
On they sweepâ a mass of Joltingr. Jost
ling, laughing pleasure seekers. There
doesn't seem room for any more. Still
they come. Standing room Is at a pre
mium. The band marches proudly â¢ on
playing "We Won't Come' Home Until
Morning." and the waves. whirl and eddy
and curl about the boat as she slowly

Jammed to Its fullest capacity. Slowly
and singly and with. Infinite patience one
by one pass through the gates and then
make a mad rush toward the boat." 1
The principal cry of hundreds of people
is: "I can't find Annie"; "I promised- to
meet Harry here at 9 and he hasn't
come." and "Has anybody seen 'Jennie â
she has the lunch."
Nine out of ten have troubles of their
own.
Naturally, people say at random, '.Til
meet you at the ferry." When there are
thousands of people about it Is a needle
ln-a-haystack proposition. One might as
well give up before. they begin.
They are not spring chickens either.
And that is the way It goes until one is
nearly black in the face striving to re
member the names and numbers of that
delighted little outside line waiting to get
their tickets second hand.
"Say. get me two tickets to Mill Valley
and returnâ will you? That's right, lady,
be a good fellow," and a hand slap nearly
took all my breath.
"Well, while you're about it. supposing
you get me five to Schuetzen Park." More
money but no possible escape. Â¦ -
I grasped my 50 cents tightly in my
hand when somebody grabbed me and I
had an extra dollar. Â»
Off went that energetic, forgetful man,
administering jabs first on one side and
then on the other in quite an impartial
fashion, and then walking serenely right
up people's backs If they didn't clear the
way fast enough. Ha was a Jyplcal pic~

During the exchange I got a poke in
the ribs and my hat was knocked sixty
ways for Sunday.

away we went like so many college boys
worming their way through a crowd.
"Hurry up, Magâ you're . Just about as
b'.ow as the ice wagon on a thunderin*

I'll git . Golly whaps! Left a box
on th-> car. You git in here and git six

It is mlg-hty bard work. . . Â¦ . : â¢
If I was going to cross the bay I migrht
need a ticket, so I made up my mind to
get 6oraewhere near the ticket office.
I wondered Inwardly how Johnnie could
get very far away. The depot reminded
me of a neatly packed can of squirming
sardines.
"Johnnie, If you don't hang onto my
skirts I'll give you to that policeman over
there. Now mind jne or you can't go."
And everybody goes. Well people, lame
people, cripples In chairs, babies In arms
and even dogs on chains. "" Everybody In
the city seems Imbued with a eingle Idea,
and that is to get out into the country for
some fresh air!
They <aJJ off the cars In any old way
and start out for somewhere on the dead
run, and then they are swallowed up and
lost to eight.
They come In twos or fours or sixes,
anything tn the even, but the odd num
bers are non Â«Â»st. "Two is company," you
know the rest.
It 1* Â«. pretty sight to watch, but once
fose your footing on the beautiful out
eide and you are a goner. It Is the most
mobby mob that ever happened. Every
body pulling and pushing and striving to
pet somewhere ahead of the other fellow.
It Is a picturesque sight, this Sunday
picnic crowd. The people winding In and
out and the white-slippered^ whlte
frocked. white-capped damsels . tripping
merrily along with Johnny White-trousers
to "Lamb, Lamb, Lamb" or "Goo-Goo
Eyes" that Is played right Heartily by
two or three brass bands all at one and
the ram* time.
The thousand and one wagons are not
to be dreaded half as much as that crowd.
Once on the beautiful outskirts I paused
and dared to look about.
There they were and there they stayed
until I armed myself with gum and all
the paper* and after a struggle landed In
the etre*t.
"Mornin' papers! All about the ship
wreck! All the news here! Mornin* pa
pers!"
Te gods! Talk about bedlam turned
loose! All San Francisco had donned
white duckjs and sallied forth with . its
lunch basket on one arm and its girl on
the other.
TVhlle I stood there watching this wlg-
Bly mass of good nature I was completely
surrounded by various spielersâ gum boys,
newspaper urchins and a few enterprising
etreet youngsters, all clamoring and yell-
Ing their particular brand at me.
"Now> your chance, mister. Chewln*
gum. only 5 rents a package. Chewln'
grum. Last chance!"
I stepped and wondered where I true,
There was a f#a of seething humanity
from cne end of the ferry building to thÂ«
other.
"Camp Taylorâ Camp Taylor. Dancing
and games at Camp Taylor. Theie you

"Sunset Parkâ there's where all the Red
Men go â to Sunset Park. Round trip SI.
Chance of your life. Right this way for
Sunset Park."
"Come "with the Native Sons to Fairfax.
Native Sons lo FalrfexâFairfaxâFair
fax!"
Long before the tower loomed In sight I
knew that the Native Sons were bent on
having a Jolly time. The car was filled
Â¦witTi baskets arid hampers, and the pic
nickers were hanglrrg on to the straps for
grim death. "Don't ycr care what 'ap
pens so long's the lunch ain't spoilt,"
sputtered one fellow when he could find
the necessary breath between lurches.
Now. that Is exactly what I was Jour
neying ferry war,} for-to get Into the
thick of a picnic Jam: to see with my very
own eyes -what San Francisco people are
grumbling abo'H. and why in the world
the California Northwestern Railroad bad

j?Th one- of the curiosities of old-time
jj . legislation that the use of tobacco
il was In early colonial days rÂ»*arded
as far more Injurious, degrading and
sinful than intoxicating liquors. Both
the use and the planting of the weed wera
forbidden, the cultivation of It being per
mitted only In small quantities, "for merÂ«
neces-sltle. for phlsick, for preservation of
the health, and that the same be taken
privately by ancient men." But the "crea
ture called tobacco" seemed to have an.
Indestructible life. Landlords were
ordered not to "suffer any tobacco to be
taken Into their houses" on penalty of.
a fine to the "victualler" and another to
"the party that takes It." The laws were
constantly altered and enforced, and still
tobacco was grown and was smoked. No
one could take it "publlcquely" nor In his
own* house or anywhere else befor*
strangers. Two men were forbidden . to
smoke together. No one could smoks
within two miles of the meeting-house on
the Sabbath day. There were wicked
backsliders who were caught smoking
around the corner of the meetlngr-housa
and others on the street, and they were
fined and set In the stocks and In cages.
Until, within a few years there were New
England town3 where tobacco smoking
in the streets was prohibited, and Inno
cent cigarette loving travelers wera
astonished at being requested to cease
smoking. Mr. Drake .wrote In 1SS6 that
he knew men, then living, who . had had
to plead guilty or not guilty In a Boston
Police Court for smoking In the streets of
Boston.. In Connecticut In early days a
great indulgence was permitted to travel
ersâa man could smoke once Curing â¢>
Journey of ten miles.

WAS A CRIME

I wondered how many people streamed
nut of town. Some man remarked In my
hearlnff. "60,000 people took advantage, et
the Fourth and left town. Did you Â«Â»Â«ff
gee such an Infernal mob?"
'. Sixty thousand picnickers!
And that was no exaggeration. TnÂ»
Southern Pacific officials say that fully
60,000 people passed through their bands
on the 3d end 4th". Sixty thousand! Thlnlc
nf It! And the elty didn't seem deserted,
either.
But they scattered. Six thousand went
to Shell Mound. Fernbrook Park. Sunset
Park and Glenwcod In the Santa Crua
Mountains and 4PO0 -went to Mill Valley
alone, while a heavy train pulled out for,
Los Gates and neighboring towns.
It tÂ« nothlnj* for a picnic train to carry
nrywhere from 2000 to 5000 people and to
run with four. or five engines. In fact. It
Is an every Sunday occurrence. Besides,
that does .not include the picnic parties
that charter the Stockton boats or thÂ»
numerous tugs that are available. They
carry as a rule Rbout 250 passengers, but
It all deper.da upon the permit.
Anybody may go down to the wharf and
pay 50 cents and spend the entire day on
the water and "visit all places of Interest
rour.d the bar-"
Besides this ferry route Jam doesn't by
any means Include all the revelers. Not
by 10.CCO anyway.
The Market-street Railway carries fully
that many to the beach and park. Both
places are simply thronged with merry
makers, all rolling In the sand or rollick-
Ing en the lawns. Every soul there drops
troubles and care anS age slides off one'a
.Â«hnulder3 like water off a duck's back.
The dancers are up the beach a little
farther, but are there, nevertheless, In full
frtrce. dancing to the Jingle of many
glasses'.
Then there are the music fiends In th*
park and the people who like to row &
boat or have a little peace and quiet to
some, secluded corner.
The Ingleslde and San Mateo traveler*
swell the crowds and Vie ferry-boats be
tween Oakland and Alameda are never
idle.
It Is nothing for the ferries to handl*
20.000 on a pleasant holiday.
All these people help to make nj> thÂ«
Immense crowd that weekly says good-by
to this city for a day.
No matter what direction I went In. no
matter what my destination was or now I
got there, I encountered the iamÂ» merry
throngâ and the same sharp elbow. It Is
. the prerogative of the Sunday crowd.
The only comfort I had was coming;
home, when I owned the waiting room,
the cars, the boatâ all. For the Sunday
fresh air fiends arÂ« faithful and will
never desert their friends, and their motto
is "Get your money's worth."
It is no wonder a railroad scatters pos

THE SUNDAY EXODUS FROM SAN FRANCISCO.FRENCH- DUELS
A^'FAKESl
THE sun is about 92,000,000 miles oft.
The only way of measuring the dis
tance of a fixed star is by parallax,
and scarcely more than half a dozen
can be estimated that way. Suppose the
sun is here, in space, on January^ 1. On
July 1. It will be 184,000,000 miles over
there. This is the base of measurement.
The observer who wants to estimate th*
distance of, say, the star A Centauri, notes
its position with regard to the next star.
In six months he notes it again; and if they
are separated by a different distance, a
eo-caUed parallax is established, and some
calculation can be made of the distance
of the nenebt one. In the most favorable
[cases. this rarallax is extremely slight.
What 1Â» the sun made of? The lines of
the spectrum give an idea of Its chemical
properties, but beyond that it is hypoth
esis. His substance, as a, whole, is of
much lighter material than the earth, but
yet there may be a hard and heavy fiery
pudding Inside, for there is a light and
thick outer coating, named the photo
sphere. Outside this, again, refining away
to an unknown distance, is. the chromo
sphere, of hot air, bo to apeak. The spots
are rifts through tho photosphere, coming
and gcing, and some are so large. that our
whole earth-could be shot right through.

she rlg-htedÂ°a bit and swung *round; but,
unhappily, she "jammed" between two
great -hidden spurs of rock and remained
Immovable, despite all efforts. A tornado
v.as looming in the distance, which made
matters worse. However, by the eld ef
ropes ma'de fast to the boats and thÂ«n
passed under the keel of the steamer, the
bows of the Peace were by a united heavÂ«
raised off the rocks, and after half an
hour's hard pulling they got her quite f roa
and brought her to shore. Just In time,
for a fearful wind almost immediately
eprang up, and torrents of rain fell, which
would have capsized the vessel entirely.
?Cext morning, with the boat on a Band
bank, the holes were carefully plugged
Â¦with cloth and cotton Â¦waste, and the wa
ter baled out. Again, another contre
tempsâthe Peace had sunk so deeply into
the sand that no effort of the mission
aries or the crew could move her. Shovels
were obtained from a neighboring mis
sion. Then another missionary boat, be
longing to an American society, endeavor
ed to tow the partially submerged vessel
off the sandbank, but the six-inch rope
broke again and again. Eventually a
dozen ehovels dug a channel sufficiently
large for the Peace to float again.

instance, two of his men and thÂ© fireman
were enjoying a swim, when the later,
who remained longer In thÂ« water, was
just reaching forward to grar.p the gun
wale of the small boat, when bo shouted,
"Hold me: a crocodile has got vy hand."
llis comrades immediately caught hold
of him and tried to pull him on board,
but the crocodile would not let go and
dragged the poor fireman nearly out of
sipht and the others nearly Into the
water. A great struggle ensued as to
who oou!d pull the harder. The advan
tage was in the balance for Â«oms nve
minutes, when with a final unavailing ef
fort and a lot of swishing the crocodile
retired, leaving his intended victim a sad
wreck and terribly exhausted. The mis
sionaries naturally saw the hand of God
in this escape and the incident made a
powerful impression on the natives, A
terrible experience befell the Peace a
year cr two later. On the way to the
equator the vessel struck on a reef of
rock and in three minutes the whole of
the forepart of the eteamer as far as the
engine-room was full of water up to the
level of the river outside, while tha

Birds Fly.
WE talk a great dear about the
speed of our railway trains
and of our ocean greyhounds,
but we are apt to overlook the
fact that there are some swift
travelers where no rails have ever been
laid and no steamship has steered her
course. The carrier pigeon will fly ai
least thirty miles an hour, and some havo
been known to travel at the rate of sixty
or even ninety mlle3 an hour. Wild
pigeons often fly hund^ds of miles a day
to feed, returning to their roosts at night.
Audubon says they travel a mile a min
.ute.
fowls, gulls, terns and'petrels lit
erally fly on the wings of the wind, if sur
prised in a storm. They will rise high in
the air, facing the gale, and making a
little progress forward as well as upward.
Then they v will suddenly descend with
rapid flight toward one side of the storm-
Bwept path, but falling oft at the same
time In the direction of the blowing wind.
Once more they will sweep around and
face the storm, ascending heavenward
and striking desperately out toward the
direction of the storm, until finally they
work themselves to one side of the storm
center.
During tremendous wind storms birds
may sometimes be seen flying overhead
at a great height. When this Is noted it
may be taken for granted that the upper
air is comparatively quiet, and that the
storm is confined chiefly to the lower re
gions. It Is when the storm extends too
high up that they drift away with the
wind or fly away on the edge of the hurri
cane. *
Migrating birds fly over distances so
great that they must needs have great
strength as well as great speed in flight.
Bobolinks often rear their young on tha
scores of Lake Winnipeg, and, like ttua
aristocrats, go to Cuba and Porto Rico to
spend the winter. To do this their fllsht
must twice cover a distance of morethan
2S0O miles, or more than a fifth of the cir
cumference of our earth, each year, r -Vv'
The little redstart travels ; 3000 miles
twice a year, and the tiny humming bird
2000. What wonderful mechanism it !a
that in a stomach no larger than a pea
will manufacture its own fuel from two or
three slim caterpillars, a fly, a moth or a
spider, and use it with such economy as
to be able to propel itself through the air
during the whole night at a rate of about
fifty miles per hour, and at the same time
keep ita own temperature at about 104
degrees.
Not all _the swift travelers, however,
make their journeys through- the air.
Some fish attain great Â«peed in the water.
The salmon and the swordflsh are tha
fastest swimmers of all the forked-tall
fishes. Only a fast running horse could
outstrip a salmon, for it swims a mile in
less than two minutes, and any horse
could be left behind in a long race, for
the fish can cover thirty miles an hour.

BLUSHES WHEN
1 :"vV;RAIN:-: FALLS,
THE blushing tree is one of the
strange things found in the swamps
of Florida. It is found only In the
; thickets of these Interminable
marshes, whose luxuriant vegetation al
ways proves a revelation to explorers. It
is called the blushing tree by those who
know it, because it actually blushes or
turns a pink color when rain falls upon
it. It is a graceful tree, with broad, ba
nana-like leaves. Wide-spr'eading branches
hang; down slightly waving In the warm
breeze, . and* it has emerald-hued foliage.
It rises to a height of 'twenty feet, and
its thick, substantial trunk indicates
many; years of existence. ."While watch

rents," eays a returned swamp â¢ explorer,
"after* a custom it has Jn these parts. As
the cool water drenched the tree I was

the sailora may pity the miners under

for the water drips through the roof con

Many a time have the men and mine

four miles under the Irish Sea and about
600 feet below the water level. Here hun
dreds of miners work day and night In the
pitch black galleries, with a world oÂ£
water over their heads.
A neighboring town, Worklngton, onca
'possessed a similar mine, but one evil day
the sea broke through the roof, drowned
thirty-six miners and destroyed the col
liery. Several years ago there was a ca
tastrophe like this In one 'of the Lake Su

that seam the owners of the mine expend
ed $300,000. . This mine sprung a leak once

HOW UNCLE SAM'S ACCOUNTS
ARE KEPT IN THE
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
UNCLE SAM will epend about $730,
0*30,000 between July 1 and June 30
of next year. AU of that immense
sum is accounted for and ultimate
record made of it by one set of
bookkeepers, twelve in number, in the
Treasury Department at "Washington. By
these twelve men Uncle Sam's daily cash
account is kept straight, and every morn
ing a balance is struck showing how much
cash the Government took In the day be
fore from Its various sources of revenue,

csparxments, and giving the . total of the
remaining cash in hand. Accompanying
this daily balance sheet is a statement
made up in another division showing the
character of the money on handâ gold,
silver and bank notes. It is an interesting
place, this counting room of Uncle Sam.
where the state of the finances Is exhib-"
lted. A dozen or so big Iedger6 and an Im
mense day book, known In business
houses as a "blotter," contain the records.
Their pages exhibit every day exactly the
amount of business the Government is
doing and whether Uncle Sam's household
expenses exceed his Income or' not. It
must be understood, of course, that these
accounts are a final summary of the busi
ness transacted and that a thousand and
one other books are required for the de
tailed record in other departments.
Big figures are dealt in here. The book
keepers make an entry of $250,000 as uncon
cernedly as a merchant would enter a ton
of coal, or a grocer the sale of a pound of
tea to a credit customer. The balances

There at a glance is a statement of Un- -

statement and shows a prosperous condi-.

what you might term the pin money of
the Government, the statement also shows
that the treasury "contains a little matter
of $150,000,000 in gold coin and bullion, a
reserve fund, and a trifle of $771,592,989 In*

THE SUNDAY GALL.
CHARLES SCHREYVOGEL, whose "My Bunkie" was the sensation of the art world last year,' has painted another remarkable picture of frontier life. "How!
Kola!" which is on exhibition in the gallery of the Society of American Artists and which is reproduced here by special permission of the artist, will appeal to
every one who knows the West. There has been a battle between a band of Indians and a squadron of cavalry. The Indians have been routed. In the flight
the pony of one of the Indians has fallen. A trooper is riding down upon the fallen Indian and^is about to kill the redskin, when the Indian recognizes the sol
dier and cries "How! Kola!'^. In the vernacular of the Indian "How" has a variety of definitions. Much depends upon how it is ut'tered. It may mean "Hello," "Oh,"
"Stop" or "Don't." "Kola" means, friend. The trooper, about to shoot the Indian, hears his cry of "How! Kola!" looks at the sprawling figure and recognizes a man
who once saved his Kfe. He checks himself and the Indian's life is spared. The incident is historically, true.
In "How! Kola!" Schreyvogel combines those elements of vigorous action with wonderful fidelity to detail, for which he is famous. No painter knows the
horse, the red man, the soldier and the cowboy better. His frontier pictures have the atmosphere of the West with all its rugged picturesqueness and vivid contrasts.
"How!" Kola!" together with "My Bunkie" and some other. Schreyvogel canvases will be on exhibition in the Pan-American Arts building. What reception
the latest of Schreyvogel's paintings will get from the judges of the Society of American Artists cannot, of course, be known until the awards are announced. Last
year "My Bunkie" won the Clark prize', the richest gift in the realm of American art. In the estimation of many Â£ood judges* "How! Kola!" ranks higher than "My

/ ' V.â DEATH. " y
By reason, of sin all men are destined
to. die. Death and the grave stands be
fore all. -Nothing is so feared and dreaded.
But when sin, death's sting, is overconÂ»e
through Christ, we have nothing to fe:tr
of death. ' V- 7- ' . Â¦
absorbed in tne wungs that ares seen. that
we forget the things that are not seen.
All the sins and follies of this world
must be given up, because they prevent
the noblest development in this life and
eventually lead to the separation from all
that is good and pure in heaven. Young
people, beware of the associations yov
form- in life. You will find it easy or dlfi
flcult to be true to God, according to your
companions and associations. If - you
would be true in your right relations to
God, beware of the' spirit of the present
world. * .-:â¢Â¦-
Don't dress for another,' world at the
looking-glass of this...
Â¦ The important thing is to settle the
question whether, we want : to love God
and seek to serve and please him. If that
Is our decision anything that would pre
vent carrying it out must be aveided. The
.place of danger, is along the border.. It. is
there the enemy locates his camp. Our
only salvation :n this world is in decision
of character. We must be people of one
purpose, and dead in earnest in carrying
out that purpose. . The way to victory
over the spirit of Â¦ the -world' is the . sur
renderof the will and life to God. â¢ v
IV. SELF.
Here is to many their Waterloo. They
can't quite consent for self to be under
the full sway of Christ.
Self assumes part>of the government
Â¦ and most earnestly contends the right to
â¢divide" the sovereignty of the heart be
tween Christ and Satan. .This Is a fatal *
blunder. Many say they would like to be
come a Christian, but they persist in
having their own- way in the disposal 'of,
their time, property, ' indulgences, etc.
They can't quite consent for Christ to be"
their "all and In all."
This is a great source of fear and fail
ure among many : Christians. It is the
hardest thing to have their own hearts
pierced by the sword of the spirit and to
say, "Thy will, not mine, be done."
Pride, selfishness, anger; swayings, car
ral appetite and passion must be brought
under the gentle sway of Christ. -
Self or God? Which shall It be?
The heart is the strategic point. All
true religion begins Â¦there, and It's" good
to begin with the beginning. . Christ, came
"to present you holy and unblamable and
unreprovable iu his sight." â '- \ ; - v - ' :
Self loves not always â¢ the ; best, for self
rebels against the spirit of the cross. ..'
The conquest, of the world is, from first
to last, the conquest of yourselves. It is
a glorious struggle and sublime to see one :
wrestling with his evil inclinations and
subduing them in Christ's strength, .crush- j
ing out wicked desires and passions and,
crowding his life with the pure and good.
Overcoming one's self is. what counts. We :
who bear the image of God should take
our rank with the forces that' build up
and- conserve character, rather than with
those that through selfish ease or indif
ference allow character to decay. Â¦Â¦', â¢Â¦
What does 1 - it mean' to thus' consecrate
one's self to Christ? - ;
If I should consecrate my life to -some
line of studyâ art or music, for instanceâ
what would I do? * I would first of all
fully -make my choice â¢a'nd adhere -to - it
through all obstacles. Nothing should di
vert me from my .purpose. I would seek
the very best teacher, put mysel fender his
tuition and obey his Instructions, not once
presuming, that- I could follow my own
methods in preference to his. . I would
read the best books upon the subject of
my choice, 'and I would study ; the work of
the best artists, and take the most' perfect
models as my- 'deas.' In this way the high
est possibilities In me would be developed.
It is somehow so in the Christian life. The
decided choice must be made, once " and
forever. The- one -.Teacher -must be our
guide and instructor, 'and implicit obedi
ence given to his direction. His character
and his work must be the model of our
own, and all. that. 1 . does not tend, to our'
completeness In ' the vocation of a Chris
tian must be. ruled-out i of our thoughts
and conduct. Such , consecration is not
for the few, only; no professed disciple of
the Lord Jesus should have a lower stand
ard. The outcome, how glorious! Soul,
upon the children of disobedience." "For
of whom a man is overcome, of the sanw
is he brought *in bondage."
Many a poor, sickly person has starved
to death amidst plenty' of the most whole
some and appetizing food, for tne want
of an appetite! What matters it how rich
the provision for the spiritual life of man,
if he la wholly absorbed in his physical
life. Take him where you willâ Into our
paradises of beauty and fragrance of
flowers, Into our well-equipped libraries,
into our art galleries and museums, and
he will be sure to find that which appeals
to the lower and animal nature, while thq
pure and noble and sublime will miss hli
view.
God has ordained the beautiful ns an
agent of the higher life. : Men are not
only to have a taste for the beautiful
objects of life; they are to produce beau
tiful thoughts and deeds.
Beautiful thoughts and deeds -stamp
themselves upon the face. | There are
faces that have possibilities of beauty
but they are empty: they tell of a starved
soul. Others are written with discontent
ana selfishness. â¢â¢ . .
An artist once secured an unwilling
Chinaman to sit as a model for him.
"John." he said, "if you don't look pleasr
anter I won't pay you."
"Ko use," said John; "when Chinaman
feelee ugly he lookee uglv."
The secret of an attractive personality
is high thinking and a pure heart. â¢ Only
when a beautiful face mirrors a beautiful
soul has the world found its ideal.
The great thing of Importance to all
of us is to know- ne art of right living
and the science of character building. Man
must so live that the higher and spiritual
things of life may lend loveliness to mind
and heart. "For." as Dr. HIllls says, "it
seems an incongruous thing for man to
adorn his cottage, lend charm to its walls
a.iJ windows, make Its ceilings to be like
the floor of â heaven for beautv, Â¦while
within his heart he cherishes groveling
littleness, slimy sins, light-winged
evasions, brutal passions. He whose body
rides In a palace car must not carry a
soul that is like unto a savage."
'Jesus Is able to save us from this bond
age -of the carnal and fleshly mind. He
makes those who come unto him "new
creatures," desirous of the things that
feed the higher life.
A great American lecturer, speaking of
the uselessneps of most men's lives, once
paid: "If millions in Africa and in other
parts of the world were sunk in the sea
they would not be missed. Thousands In
Christian lands could be spared and not
missed. The bubbles where they, went
down would mean as much to the worM,
as do their lives now." Some are endowed
â¢with Â¦wonderful power but their life is
low, but Jesus Christ in a man's life will
elevate, improve and /enlarge it, inspiring
the soul with noble aspirations.
What was the life of John Bunyan
worth before he became a Christian? If
he had been cast Into the sea the world
would not have missed him. His life was
an empty bubble.
But Bunyan became a Christian"" and a
new ideal of life was born into his soul.'
Then if Bunyan had been sunk iri the
sea, what an incalculable loss the world
would have sustained!
It Is not possible for the life of every
one to become so rich as that of Bunyan,
hut no one-can come to Christ in sincer
ity without becoming glorious.
How many narrow, selfish, worthless
lives we witness! Men and women think
little thoughts. Indulge narrow feelings,
experience low desires aria do little good
because the life that is in them is narrow,
and low. . â¢ â¢
III. THE WORLD.
The friendshjp of. this world, we .are
told, Is enmity with God; and whosoever
will be a friend of the world is the enemy
of God. - * : .
No moral evil In jthe world 'itself apart
from man. There Is no > reference to an
abstract world that holds us in its grasp.
The thought is living wholly for : the
things pertaining to this life only. We are
to love the good things In this earthly
life and covet the best gifts, while we' are
to shun the evil things of this earthly life
âthe things which hinder our right rela
tions with God and prevent our learning
to do good. Whatever retards growth in
Christian character and destroys one's
power of Christian usefulness and help
fulness is of this world only, and must be
overcome. Worldly customs, maxims,
dress, amusements, notions about 're
ligion and social evils are to be carefully
watched. We are not to follow the multi
tudes willingly, thinking we shall come
out all right in the end. \ ..:.-.
May we learn the timely lesson and
make all our experiences In life glorify
Christ and build up Christian character -
Â¦Many things in this world are a mixed
and ever present power of attraction and
temptation. . Â¦
The Papists are wrong in their monasti
cal ideas. We are not to Withdraw from
the society of men, neglect or cast away
our business and property. An abstracted
and sublimated devotion to God is imprac
ticable and absurd. While we abide in
this earthly, sphere we are to live for the
heavenly and eternal world.
The danger comes .when we become so
?* "Y EXT to tie roost masterly and
/\ I unanswerable argument of Paul
I V 'In the Book of Homans in de
\ V fense of the plan of salvation by
VÂ» faith in Christ stands his great
discoTxrse on the resurrection of the dead
found in I Cor,, xv. His great theme is
the resurrection of the dead, which he
proves f rota the fact of Christ's resurrec
tion. After picturing the glorious change
from the corruptible to the Incorruptible,
from the mortal to the -immortal, he ex
claims triumphantly. VDeath is â¢ swal
lowed ttp in victory. O death.' where is
thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"
' He then says, "The sting of death is sin
and the power of sin Is the law." This
being true, the thing to v do I* to get ri<l
of the sting of death, which Is sin. an-1
this Is possible through Christ. "But
.thanks be to God. who giveth us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ"
These words bring to our hearts much
needed comfort in the glorious truth that
there is victory over death and the grave
: "because there is victory over sin through
our Lord Jesus Christ.
To every man life is a battle. This world
Is the battlefield. .Numerous are the foes
Â¦which assail him. This truth is empha
sized in the experience of every man who
is pledged to a holy life and the spread
of righteousness and truth, which deÂ«
. jnands the full work of a faithful soldier.
To some the struggle will be harder than
lo others, but none shall ever be without
foes. The warfare against the forces of
darkness will continue until Christ shall
reign supreme. Xone must think of lay.
ing aside the armor until the crown be
â¢won in heaven.
In this struggle we are much like Eli
sha's young servant; we see too much of
the enemy and too Little of our God. Our
eyes are blinded by fear, which ify the
fruit of doubt and unbelief. We hear the
bitter wails of the many all about us who
have gone down under the stroke of thÂ»
enemy, by trusting in themselves.
At the same time, we hear the songs of
triumph from the many who have con
quered and Â¦who continue to conquer
Â» trough our Lord Jesus Christ.
. We are told that all enemies have i>een
conquered except death. Our knowledge
goes further than that. We know death
has been conquered also; it has surren
dered to our Christ. But death is con
quered because sin h2s been conquered.
To all there are some battles to fight bo
fore we shall be ready to triumph over
death. These are (1) against the devil,
<2) the carnal mind. (3) the world, (4) self,
(5) then our last foe. death.
L THE DEVIL-A MIGHTY FOE.
By nature his captives. "That they
ingy recover themselves out of the snare
of the devil, who are taken captive by
him at his will." (II Timothy ii:26.) He
is the unseen leader of all our opposing
forces and unless we are extremely care
ful we shall fall a prey to his strategy.
He Is compared to a smith at his forge
blowing with the breath of temptation
upon the coals of human desire, until they
are sufficiently heated to melt the pur
poses of the will, and then, our will hav
ing yielded, he bends and fashions us as
he pleases. â¢
Satan, the great arch-demon of the sroul,
must be battled against.- He is cunning
and crafty in his attacks. He seldom. If
ever, openly opposes the truth. He does
a good deal of masquerading in disguising
his purposes. But whatever his modes of
attack upon the kouI he must be met and
overcome. This is a struggle that never
ceases; it is a hand-to-hand conflict and
a battle till death. We are told that when
Xapoleon had captured Saragossa he
found the battle, was renewed in every
street and was not finally won until the
desperate defenders of that city had been
met and defeated singly and individually.
Jesus came to destroy the works of the'
devil and he trill save from his wrath and
subtlety those who surrender themselves
to him and trust him.
Jesus overcame Satan in the wilderness,
triumphed over him on the cross and he
reigns the conqueror In glory.
But no man can be saved against his
will. There are certain antecedent con
ditions of heart necessary before Christ
can save a man from the power of Satan.
Man must be tired of sin and long to be
a. good man. Then he must turn away
from Bin to Christ, who will abundantly
save BEd gloriously keep saved.
Luther tells us of his experience with the
devil, who said to him, "Master Luther
thou art a threat sinner and thou wilt be
damned." "Stop, stop!" I said, "one
thing at a time. I am a great sinner, it
Is trueâthough thou hast no right to eay
eo-J for.fess it. What next?"
"Therefore thou shait be damned," uuoth
he. ; -
"That is not good reasoning," said I.
It 18 true that l,am a great sinner, but
Is written, 'Christ Jesus came to save sin
ners, therefore I shall be saved. Now eo
thy vrsY.
"So did I cut off the devil with his own
sworu. and he went away sorrowing be
cause he could not cast me down by call
intr me a sinner."
Thank God for victory over Satan
through Christ's atoning blood It is
, .u I 1 oV^'coines Satan within and
Christ that achieves every conquest with
out. - , i
Unless we turn' from sins to Christ, our
Kins shall cast us down in defeat We
must make the choice ourselves. How
forcibly does Whit tier embody this sol
emn truth in the following lines:
Tho* God be rood and free be heaven
No force divine car. love compel;
And tho' the song of sins forgiven
MÂ»y sound through lowest' hell.

II. THE CARNAL MIND-THE FLESH-
LY MIND,
Many have a fleshly mind. Sin reigns
In their bodies; they obey it In the lusts
thereof; their members are instruments
of unrighteousness; they yield their mem
bers servants to uncleanness and to ini
quity: they are the servants of those
whom they obey (Rom. C:12>. What slaves
to the flesh there are! How many are
sewing the flesh In the lusts thereof' The
centsr and circumference of their life is
eating and drinking and- reveling in the
pleasures of sin. What slaves to appetite,
to strong drink, to Impurity, to the,un
wholesome pleasures of sense. The end
of these things is death. "For these

TO A CLOSE

Epworth League Delegates
To- Day's Sessions Will GJpse Â£
Great Gathering Mark
Epoch in League's History..
THE approach of the closing ses
sions of the great Epworth
League convention has served to
rouse the Interest of delegates to
a high pitch. It Is expected,
therefore, that to-day's proceed;-
Jngs. which will round out one of the most
Buccessful gatherings In the history of the
league, will be productive of . material
good to the organization.
Yesterday's sessions were of the most
Interesting- character. They began with
the customary cunrise 'praise service at
the various churches, and the attendance
at each was ait that the directors could
desire. In the morning there were largely
attended meetings at the Pavilion, Metro
politan Temple, Central and Howard
street- churches and the. Alhambra
Theater. A round-table was a fea
ture at most of the meetings, and In
the discussions Â¦which followed some valu
able suggestions for league workers were
made.
At noon there were open-air meetings at
City Hall square, on Van Ness avenue.
near Golden Gate avenue, and on' the
same thoroughfare between Hayes ".and
Fell streets. At the same hour meetings
for business men were held In f the court
yard of the PaUce Hotel and In the rooms'
of the Chamber of Â¦ Commerce. . All of;
these meetlnc* were largely attended; and
considerable Interest therein" was~ mani
fested. â¢' '
A grand Junior rally was held at the Pa
vilion In the - afternoon, at whlch_ several
Interesting addresses we're made. A" com
plimentary concert at the park attracted
several thousand Leaguers to that popu--
lar resort. *
The conference of missionaries at the :
Central Church last night was largely at
tended. The proceedings were of the most
interesting: nature. State rallies at vari
ous churches dosed the day's proceedings.
A matter of interest to the members of. 1
the league was the meeting of the com
mittee on resolutions of the board of con
trol, which was held at the Palace Hotel
during the aftern6on. The main ques
tion, that of the next place of meeting of
the convention, was considered, but no
conclusion was reached. ThÂ« only city to
make an offer for the convention was
Minneapolis, but the offer made was
deemed to be rather Indefinite, and the
subject was referred to a special commit
tee to consider the claims of Minneapolis
and Detroit to the honor. This committee
may meet to-day to settle the vexed ques
tion, but as no Instructions were given
relative to the time a report was expect
ed the sub-committee .may arrive- at a
conclusion at : ts pleasure.
Last night's conoer v at the .Pavilion
rerved to fill that structure to the doors.
The various numbers of the excellent' pro^'
fraraae, which were so greatly relished
Tuesday evening, were repeated. The
chorus was In fine voice, and the features
of the evening were rendered to the com
plete enjoyment of all present
Many Leaguers are already leaving the
rtty on ride trips to the Yosemlte and
ether resorts in various parts of the State.
Of these a certain percentage will return
to the city, but the greater part will Jour
ney eastward to their homes after the
completion of their outings In the Interior.
Several hundred will leave the city to
morrow night, in advance of the main
army of Leaguers, which will leave during

the league, and It is part of the Methodist sys
tem of education. The relation which the
Methodist church sustains to the national' life
is vital. The work of Methodism in the past 'is
the best evidence of its being a providential
agency called forth for the performance of a
particular mission. It Is claimed the founding
of Methodism not only resulted in a revival, of
religion but that it. saved England from the
revolution which later swept over France. In
order to be effective Methodism. does not reject
crude methods where better could not be had.
She has adapted herself to the needs 'of the na
tion without a compromise of principle and has
performed hard, plain work without a com

C. V. Vickery of Chicago spoke upon the
missionary committee, its appointment,
purpose and duties. In introducing his
subject he asked for the number of chap
ters that had missionary committees. A
vote showed about one chapter in four
represented had one. He urged that a
year from, now every chapter should have
one. He answered numerous questions
asked from the floor.
Rev. P. L. Cobb of Xashville, Tenn..
epoke upon the missionary meetings.
"Prayer is one of the greatest elements
that enter into any meeting," he an
nounced, and emphasized this remark by
asking the audience to stand and its mem
bers to lead in prayer. Several responded.
â¢'Another element in the meetings is
eong," he said. "Let us sing," and the
audience sang. "Another element that we
need to cultivate is the reading of the
Scripture. "Will you give us selections*
from them?" lie asked, and numerous re
sponses came from all over the house.
Twenty-five volunteers for missionary
work were present and half a dozen more
volunteered to place themselves in 1 the
hands of their respective boards for work
on the foreign field.
The Iowa delegates marched In at this"

arm and hand are on God's altar to make
this year memorable to the Methodist

Edward D. Soper of Harisburg, Pa.,
spoke on "Systematic Giving." He said:

Rev. Mr. Mitchell then went on to' say
that Minneapolis was ready, to assume the
.weighty responsibility the coming Â¦ of the
convention -, would impose. He v showed
letters from the Governor of Minnesota,
Mayor of Minneapolis and from the Com
mercial " Club ' and other civil ' bodies â¢ as
suring . him I that nothing would be , left
undone to give the> convention delegates
a. royal time while enjoying the hos
pitality of Minneapolis.
"Wo have a convention hall capable of
seating 6000 people," went on Mr.
electric lights and. all that sort of thing
w'e will make up in some other way.", :
'-At this point, at the suggestion of Dr.
Berry, the committee went into executive
session. The matter was . discussed for
nearly an > hour. The sentiment was ex
pressed : by A. C. Crews, who is said to
favor Detroit, that the offer made by Min
neapolis was vague and Indefinite. There
was nothing. to show that the city would
provide ( for the convention in a tangible
manner. The committee required definite
assurances, which, thus far, had not been
given. ' - --"Â¦ .

The ' matter was ' discussed ' at some
length, with the result that" thÂ« question

sisting of Messrs. Berry, Du Bose, Carter,

sition and report to the committee at a
later date.- - Â¦ .--".Â»Â¦;.
; There is no telling when the committee
will- meet or when It will file its conclu

will be selected by to-morrow, but as there
is no definite time set for filing a report
no action may be;taken.for weeks. 'Â¦ The
complexion of the committee as to .the

.who desired to advance the claim of any
other city, but there was no response. Dr.

stood that Detroit was in the field, and
that the representatives of that city asked

postponed until they had an opportunity
of arguing the matter before the commit

"The thermal belt of Methodism In this
country, so to speak, lies I in the States
along the parallel of Ohio, Indiana, I111-.

cannot do as well as San Francisco has
done, we will do as well as we can, and.
that is saying a great deal."
C. R. Ellis, Â¦ also of Minneapolis, stated
that hew* advised that a new convention

shortly, so that there could be no question

ASE CLEARLY DEFINED
In the absence of the regularly selected
.speaker, Rev. B. D. McCreary delivered
an address on "The League Devotional
Meeting" that elicited much applause,
despite the fact that it was wholly Im
promptu; " He endeavored to impress upon
the Leaguers that spirituality is essential'
for the making 'of conversions. He de
clared that Christianity Is spiritual or It
is nothing; that its very birth was due to
a mighty - outpouring of spirit, and : that
every great movement of Christianity has
been spiritual in nature. He told of how
all the great leaders of Bibical times were
centers of spirituality, and said that John
Wesley, the founder of the Methodist de-.
nomination, was â¢ not successful - or an
efficient minister until he became Inspired
by spirituality../ :".- , '; . , ; "
In conclusion he said that the Kpworth
League, being a" child of the Methodist
church, must become a teacher of spiritu-.
allty and that, therefore, special attention
should be paid to the spiritual- depart
ment. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ' â¢ : ' â
Finally, put your whole soul Into the presen
tation of the lesson, and your study and prepa
ration will bear fruit.
Read the selected passages over, at" least- a
half-dozen times until the analysis of the sub
ject unfolds itself. If you want clear Ideas of
the subject ponder it well. Then take a good
topical index and find every ' passage in the
Bible on, the topic to be studied and compare
them. You will find that the comparative texts
6uggest thqughts and you will speedily prove
the Bible to be its own best commentary. Do
not touch the helps . until * you have carefully
studied the Bible itself and got out of it all
that prayer and spirit can bring. Having done
this, read everything you can get upon the sub
ject. No danger of getting too much. You must
not expect to enlighten others unless you re
ceive " light yourself. Become thoroughly ! sat
urated with the topic. You will not be able to
freely present - and discuss . the subject unless
you are perfectly familiar with It. Then study
to apply what you have learned. It will matter
little how much you know unless you are able
to apply It. -'..-.--. Â¦ * . .

Bubject "The Preparation of Leaders,"
which is one of the most interesting sub

upon the shoulders of the leaders de

and devotion to the league work. In part

The reading course is also to teach loyalty
to the church. It should' tell of its providen
tial , birth, wonderful ' development, and " great
place it has had In lifting: mankind up to right
eousness and civilization. It should, moreover,
teach the doctrines, discipline and polity of
the church, and thus create a love and an en
thusiasm for this great church of our fathers.
The reading course should â¢ show us the key
to unlock the doors of God's universe, lay. bare
the secrets of earth and sky and make plain
the mysteries of life about one's pathway. The
reading course . should teach the Leaguers how
best to improve their time, employ their tal
ents and take hold of their opportunities. It
is. for the purpose of introducing one to the
great and good of all' ages. Above all else, It is
to show the Epworth Leaguer his duty to his

Dr. Buckley concluded. his remarks with
prayer. He used many quaint and amus
ing anecdotes to illustrate his points.
Rev. John H. Coleman of Troy, N. Y.,
closed the meeting with benediction. >â¢
' Harry Morton of San Jose, the chair
man of the meeting; I. E. Blake, musical
director, and Rev. T. Alonzo Monk, D. D.,
of Knoxville, Tenn., the speaker, were on
time promptly at the stand on the avenue,
between Hayes and Fell streets, but no
audience or singers put in an appearence.
v I want to call your attention to some common
points of belief of all people. - The Jew. the
Catholic and the Protestant all believe in the
same God. Go Into any of their churches and
ask them of their God and they will tell you
the same. I talked to a Catholic priest an hour
and a quarter on points on which we agreed be
fore, we disagreed. .
Some say that the Christians are all divided.
So is our country on the eve of our elections.-
Afterward they are all patriots. So will these
Christians be hereafter.
I want you all to get some kind of a good
rellRion. I don't care whetheryou are a Meth
odist or not, if you are saved. I spend my time
getting men converted and then theyj can join
any church they want to.
A wind from the ocean, cold enough to
make walking more comfortable, was not
conducive to a big outdoor audience on
Van Ness- avenue yesterday at the noon
meeting. However, a goodly audience
gathered between McAllister street and
Golden Gate avenue to hear Rev. Mr.
Buckley. J. J. Morris led the congrega
tional singing, which was heartily joined
in by those present. â¢
Rev L. J. Norton of Napa presided and
Rev Mr. Scale of Seattle led in prayer,
asking God's blessing upon the residents
of the avenue, the police detailed for duty
and the convention work.
Dr. Buckley spoke from the steps of the
residence of Mrs. L. Jonas at 517 Van
Ness avenue instead of from the platform
on the sidewalk in front of the house. He
said in part:

hearers to be guided in- their business

he prcpiised them that in so doing they
would be rewarded with treasure of a

The meeting was brought to an appro

FRUITFUL SESSIONS,
Continued - From* Page Fourteen.
It's as difficult for a. man to keep a
diary as it is for a -woman to keep a
point on a pencil.
' â¢ The success of the local league depends al
most entirely upon the work of the cabinet.
believe thia to be literally and universally
true. ' If our leagues nre in any place ineffective
and demoralized it is, almost without except
tion, the fault of the cabinet. The cabinet* is
the president's throne and right arm of power.
The wise president will use it constantly and
â¢wisely. He will call out the advice of every
department head. He will consult the pastor
on every vital point. He will submit every
plan of importance to the /Wisdom of the cabi
net. He will wisely seek to control the cabinet,
for he U the president. With a wise president
the cabinet meeting will not be dry. in detail
and perfunctory in Us deliberations, but will
be intensely interesting in the considerations
of new i<lans. i -
Several speakers who were to- deliver
addresses failing to appear, the discussion
became general, and many of those pres
ent took part in the debate. The meeting
closed with v benediction -pronounced by
Rev. Mr. Nye.
Every other department of ,the league work
has been treated with prodigal . fullness in our
league publications, but the cabinet meeting
has been seemingly neglected. I have searched
through papers, . books and reports concerning
the cabinet meeting. â¢ And yet no department
of the league offers more opportunities for ef
fective result upon the whole league life than
this one." The President of the United States
convenes his Cabinet dally and considers the
advice and suggestions there received as abso
lutely essential *to thÂ» wise conduct of the af
fairs of state. No less will the wise Epworth
League president Â¦ consider the work of the
Epworth League It Is absolutely es
sential to the wlEe and harmonious working
of the departments. If neglected, the league
is In danger of becoming, a. "one man" organi
zation; or of running oft t6 one line of Christian
service to the neglect of. others; or. of getting
Into ruts and never discovering 'that it Is in
them. Hence the necessity and utility of the
cabinet â¢ meetinr.
Rev. Charles Lyman Nye of Crestori,
la., next spoke on the theme, "The Cab
inet Meeting." He said in substance: '
Meeting of Cabinets.
The secretary should be an earnest, conse
crated, faithful Christian; should possess all
the special qualifications needed for other de
partments, and, in addition, be a good letter
writer, have exacting habits of promptness, be
Intensely Interested in the league and welfare
of those about him, and should be able to train'
others to do the work. The secretary has th*>
opportunity to do more' than any other officer
to make the lpague a power in building up
Christian character among those coming within
Its influence.
The prevailing Idea that any one' will do for
secretary is a lamentable mistake. If there
were only one office for which the league could
find a perfect fit, it should be hoped that such
a fit could be found for the office of secretary.
service was conducted. by W. C. Stadtfeld,
and the devotions , by the Rev. ,S. H. C.
Burgln of Butte, Mont.'
The opening address was by the Rev.
"W. P. Lloyd of Louisville, Ky.. who spoke
on the subject, "The President." He argued
that the presidents of league chapters
should be animated by Christian zeal In
the performance of their duties, and that
their example for members should be of
that character which inspires emulation,
respect and confidence.
George E. Dougherty of Topeka, Kans.,
delivered an interesting address on the
subject of "The Chapter Secretary." He
said in part:
There was ,a' largely attended confer
ence of chapters' officers at the | Central
Methodist Church yesterday morning.
Every- -Phase of league work was Â¦ dis
cussed, pÂ» and con, . the; result being, a
highly ; interesting session.
E. M. Wheeler, treasurer of a chapter at
Providence, vR.,. L. presided. The , song

A round table conference occupied the
attention of the leaguers for two hours,
various topics of interest to Christian
workers being discusled by speakers In
all parts of the house. The session was a
highly Interesting one.
should antedate the problem, "an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure." The
facts demand better parents and homes; com
pulsory education with ethical training: that
the children be taught. to work; the total de
struction of the drink curse; and for new of
fenders apartments separate from the vicious
and the bastmaster in crime.
For the criminal no treatment is adequate
or Christian which does, not contemplate his
reformation. ' Make him a new man. That will
suppress crime and protect society. That is
Christian.' Nothing less will do. But how?
Treat him as \ a brother. Appeal to his honor.
Quicken his moral sense. Avoid any punish
ment which incites revenge or lower manhood.
Reward him for well-doing and demerit- him
for wrong-doing. Let the sentence be Indeter
minate in order to insure time for reform and
to release him when -practicable. Teach -his
fingers skill in the industrial arts. Work saves.
Pay him tor his toll. To have, strengthens
manhood. Cultivate his mental powers. Equip
him with might to conquer. , Lay hold on him
by love L3Â«d him to Christ. Fortify him
against the ' evil day by enriching . mind .< and
heart with Christian literature. Care for him
at the outer gate. The world is suspicious and
sometimes cold. Show him kindness. Be his
patron. Hold him up. Great will be your re
ward in heaven. 'r.:,^-.-.; ;""?;{' .â¢;-...: *-* ;

Deeplte the fact that the meeting had
been very little advertised, it proved to
be one of the most successful held during
more of the savins of their souls than of
money-getting. HÂ« pointed out the true
way to a Christian life, which he declared

neglect their work to attend the conven

a plain, business manner, as one man of

District Attorney Campbell made the
closing argument to the jury this fore
noon. After the charge by Judge Lorigan
the case was given to the jury. It at once
went to dinner and at 1:40 o'clock re
turned to deliberate. Thirty-five minutes
later it had agreed upon a verdict of mur
der in the first degree-, which carries the
death penalty. Â¦
Judge Lorigan set Friday, August 1 2, as
the time for the pronouncing of sentence.
Several of the witnesses for the defense
at- this trial and the former one will be
charged with perjury. One of the wit
nesses at the first trial, A. Vldetettl, has
already disappeared. ,. Â¦ ....
The trial that ended to-day began last
Monday. It was sensational and hard
fought, Senator Oneal alone appearing for
the Chinese. ... . .
The first trial before Judge Lorigan, in
the face of the most positive evidence,
resulted In a disagreement. This so
aroused the court that he. ordered a. new
trial within a week and appointed the
Coroner an elisor to summon a special
venire of talesmen. After the first trial
intimations of perjury were made against
some of the witnesses and one of the
jurors. Such scandal attached to the
trial that three of the attorneys employed
for the defense withdrew.

READ THE . TESTIMONY OF J. H. BO-
CARDE, the well-known foreman of the G. M.
Kutz Co. Shoe Factory, who has been a great
sufferer from chronic catarrh for over twenty-
five years. Mr. Bocarde says*. "I am a shoe
foreman at the G. M. Kutz Co. Shoe Factory,
103 Mission street, and' have lived in this city
for the past fifteen years. I have been a great
sufferer from CHRONIC CATARRH FOR
OVER TWENTY-FIVE YEARS. During all
that time I have tried a great many so-called
CATARRH CURES and treatments, but none
of them did me any good. When I came to
Drs. Shores & Shores, two months ago, I had
almost despaired of ever getting well. I HAD
SUFFERED SO LONG. MY CATARRH
BOTHERED ME ALL THE TIME. MY NOSE
WOULD DISCHARGE, AND THE GATHER-
ING IN MY THROAT MADE ME HAWK
AND SPIT CONTINUALLY to clear my
throat. The constant HAWKIXG made my
throat SORE, and it would PAIN me. It both-
ered me so much it greatly EXHAUSTED me.
The mucus would collect in my throat all night
and interfere with my sleep. This FOUL DIS-
CHARGE from the throat gradually affected
my STOMACH AND LIVER. I would BLOAT
UP after eating, and my KIDNEYS were also
affected. This was my condition when I came
to Drs. Shores. TWO MONTHS AGO. DRS.
SHORES' TREATMENT AND MEDICINES
HELPED ME FROM THE START. I can
SLEEP good now, the DROPPING in ' my
throat and the constant desire to HAWK AND
SPIT and SORENESS of the throat HAS DIS-
APPEARED.
"NO MORE BLOATING in the stomach. My
liver and kidneys are better and I feel stronger
In every way.
"DRS. SHORES' TREATMENT HAS DONE
WONDERS FOR ME, AND I TAKE PLEAS-
URE IN RECOMMENDING DRS. SHORES'
TREATMENT TO ALL SUFFERERS.

J. H. BOCARDE,
Sirs. Wilson says: "I am a glovemaker, and
have lived in San Francisco for the past six-
teen years. I have been sick for the last three
years, and have doctored a great deal with dif-
ferent physicians, but all to no purpose. I
have 'suffered a great deal from LIVER,
STOMACH and KIDNET trouble. My stomach
would BLOAT UP after eating and PAIN ME
greatly. My food did not seem to do me any
good, and after I would eat a hearty meal I
would STILL. Â¦ BE HUNGRY. My condition
grew gradually worse, until the past year I
have been UNABLE TO WORK.' I also grew
very NERVOUS and MELANCHOLY, and was
very WEAK AND RUN DOWN In every way.
This was my condition when X came to Drs.
Shores ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO. I can say
that Drs. Shores have helped 'me more in the
two weeks than ALL THE OTHER DOCTORS.
MY STOMACH DOES NOT HURT ME ANY
MORE AND I DIGEST MY FOOD. My kid-
neys and liver are much better, and my ner-
vous system is also much improved. I sleep
good now, and feel better and stronger in every
way.
"IT GIVES ME PLEASURE TO RECOM-
MEND DRS. SHORES' TREATMENT to all
sufferers, for they have done WONDERS for
me. ' ." ;

fect liberty to call on me, and I will gladly
verify the truth of the same.

MISS M'KENZIE
LOSES POSITION
Board Illegally Dismisses
Hancock School
Principal.
Charges Not Filed by Super
intendent as Charter
Provides.
In clear, violation of the charter, which
provides that a school teacher may only
be suspended or dismissed after a hear
ing on written charges made by the Su
perintendent of Schools, the Board of Ed
ucation yesterday dismissed Miss Marga
ret McKenzie. j principal of the Hancock
Grammar School, from the department.
Miss McKenzie's case was not Ilrst in
vestigated by the Superintendent, but a
public bearing was accorded her by the
Board of Education, the members of
Â¦which from their very attitude toward
the accused lady had condemned her be
forehand. The resolutions dismissing Miss
McKenzie recite that the board finds her
guilty of evident unfltness for teaching
and of Insubordination and unprofessional
conduct.
R. W. Campbell, attorney for Miss Mc-
Kenzie, stated after the meeting that he
will take the case to court. He claims
that under the charter the trial of his
client should liave been held by the Su
perintendent of Schools on sworn charges,
and that the board usurped that officials
prerogative, granted to him by the or
ganic law of the municipality.
W. H- de Bell, a graduate of the uni
versity, was elected to succeed Miss Mc-
Kenzie, thÂ© unsuccessful candidate for
the position being P. T. H. McCarthy.
Bell has never been in the department
and his election came in the nature of a
surprise. -', ..
W. W. Stone was transferred from the
principalship of the Burnett School to
that of the James Lick School.
Philip Prior was transferred from the
principalship of the James Lick School to
that of the Burnett School.
C. C. Young was transferred to the
headship of the English department of
the Lowell High School.
Three Vice-Principals Elected.
The board did politics in the election of
eeveral vice principals. Miss Nettie Wade
was elected vice principal of the Jean
Parker School. Mark nominated Miss M.
Michelson and KincaiQ placed the name
of Miss Nettie Wade in nomination. The
first ballot showed a tie vote, but the sec
ond gave Miss Wade three votes.
Casserlv nominated Miss Michelson for
the vice princlpalship of the Burnett
School and Mark nominated Miss A. B.
McGulre. Miss Michelson received three
vctes and was declared elected.
JIadi-scn Babeock was elected vice prin
cipal of the Fairmount School. Miss Ida
Strauss was the unsuccessful candidate
for the place.
Miss Agnes Reg-an was transferred front
the principalship of the Noe Valley School
to that of the Cooper School. Miss Jessie
Smith and Miss Nora Sullivan were nomi
nated for the Xoe Valley School, but after
two tie ballots the election was postponed.
Evening School Abolished.
The Franklin Evening School was abol
ished and the teachers placed on the even
ing eligible list. " '' Â¦
It was resolved that the graduates from
any grammar school cf the State be ad
mitted to the high schools of this city.
The principal of the Lowell High School
â¢was authorized to examine pupils who
have finished the work of the eighth
grade and who did not take the last ex
amination. The examination will be held
in the Lowell High School on Thursday,
July 25, commencing at 9 a. m.
M"Ies Elizabeth McDonald, No. 1 on the
substitute list, was assigned to the va
cancv in the Jean Parker School, and Miss
A. Murphy. No. 3 on the substitute list,
was assigned to the vacancy in the
Franklin School caused by the resignation
of Mrs. J. D. Cooper.
Miss Lillian O'Connell, No. 2 on the sub
stitute list, was assigned to the Pacifla
Heights School to fill the vacancy caused
by the resignation of Miss Charlotte
Thompson.
In case a new class Is formed In the
Buena. Vista School, Miss Rose Stack. No.
4 on thc substitute list, at request of
principal, will be assigned to said class.
Assistant Secretary Berliner read a
financial statement showing that out of
a total appropriation of $1,160,000 the sum
of $1,151,783 77 was disbursed during the
fiscal year 1900-1S01, leaving a surplus of
$8216 23.
Miss Charlotte Thompsons resignation
from the department was accepted.
The application of Miss Ella Fenton
that her salary warrant for December,
1898, which bad not been made out by a
former school board, be delivered to her
was referred to the City Attorney.
Pupils Must Have Seats.
The board made no change in. its rule
on classification, requiring an enrollment
of fifty-five pupils in the primary and fifty
ln the grammar grades. In a circular sent
to the principals, however, they are cau
tioned not to place any more pupils ln
a class than can be seated. The circular
advises that principals must also send a

As to Miss Bates herself aa Ibsen's
strangest heroine? I am not of those
who regard the part as the best in Miss
Bates' repertoire. Hers is wonderful
work, a strong conception, but It is not
the Hedda Gabler of Ibsen. Miss Bates
herself is too patently of the wholesome,
honest, normal sort of folk, ever fully to
merge her individuality into the decadent
complexities of Hedda's character. Her
brush is too broad, her colors too bright,
her lines too few and simple to paint
Hedda as Ibsen paints her. All the im
patient passion of the creature is thereâ
the resentment, the ghastly humor; but
the sickly half-lights that should tone
Into these are not found. Her method 13
too robust, patent, healthful in short. It
lacks the mephltic suggestion, the subtle
ty, the cold cunning of the mad thing that
Hedda is. yet ono gets grasp of the char
acter in grateful proportion even so. And
I want no more from Blanche Bates, for
the further insight that would carry her
into Hedda's heart could be obtained only
at the cost of that magnificent healthful
ness, that brilliant freshness that Is her
chiefest charm. For her generous effort
in -the play's " production there is only
praise, and one- can say to her only
"thank you" and "encore."
And as to the performance. "Hedda
Gabler" furnished several sorts of sur
prises as it was presented on Friday aft
ernoon, agreeable for the most part. Mr.
Ormonde's work was a revelation. As
Eilert Lovborg he showed a delicate pas
sion and poetry that lifted the part to
epical heights. It Is a case of absolute
Insight into the character, with a full
mastery of its technique and expression.
Albert Bruning. too, as Tesman, was
delightful. His dullness ' was almost di
vine; his quaint, maddening amiability
the most exquisite foil to Hedda's restive,
ambitions. Every short-sighted look
through his professor's glasses, every
opening of his foolish, good-natured
mouth, every word, every gesture,
splashed color on a portrait that could
not be improved upon. Campbell Gollan
was a satisfactory Assessor Brack, per
haps a little too obvious in hia methods.
Mrs. F. M. Bates made a lovable Aunt
Juliana, and Miss Mabel Howard might
have been stronger a3 Mrs. Elvsted. ;
The characters, outside of the heroine,
are conventional enough, the amiable
auntâ the only "nice" person In the play;
Tesman, Hedda's husband, a good na
tured fool: Ellert Lovborg, an amorist
and writer, formerly attached to Hedda
and later a Platonic lover of Mrs. Elv
sted; Mrs. Elvsted, a foolish little person
with a grateful mission to perform in
saving Lovborg. while incidentally sacri
ficing a somewhat ancient husband, and
Assessor Brack, the friend of the Tes
mans.who suggests, with an eye to profit
on the transaction, a menage a trols to
the bored wife â oh, they're a. charming
lot!
Hedda envies in that she has "had' her
fingers In a man's destiny." She la liar,
coward, thief and murderess In her mad
effort to pedestal herself among the "vine
leaves" she sees in Lovborg's hair, and
she won't pay the only price for the pe
destalâone moment's self-forgetfulnesa.
Hedda is mostly met with in spots luck
ily, the whole unhappy vdlume rarely
coming: together, but some of us have
met / her In all her bad glory. We've all
known the other folk, too, some In tho
exceptional moments of our lives, the
others in the every day crush.

OF the Epworth League Convention, now assembled in this city, San Francisco will long
retain pleasant memories. The thousands of delegates coming- from all quarters have
filled the streets with bright young men and young women, and have given, even to
the thoroughfares that are most habitually thronged, a measurable increase of activity
and animation ; and that, too, in spite of the fact that the delegates have not been in any *sense a
crowd of sightseers. ; Their time has been mainly spent in attendance upon'some of the numerous
meetings of the convention, and but little upon the streets.
From the first day the work of the convention 1 has been carried forward with vigor and
with remarkable success. The committee that has directed the arrangements merits high praise for
the excellence with which it performed its work. Every movement of the vast assembly has pro*
ceeded with the smoothness and precision of well-ordered machinery, and if there has been any
friction at all it has not been sufficient to attract notice or to cause discomfort.
A notable feature of the convention is the high order of oratory which has entertained as
well as instructed and exhorted the vast audiences. /An organization so well, disciplined for its
work and which has the support of so many "and such eloquent advocates cannot fail to increase
in power and in influence with the years. We can then look upon these earnest men and women
who will throng our churches to-day as among the most potent of the mighty forces which are
slowly but surely working out the problems of the moral advancement of mankind. In the con
sciousness of that fact we salute them not only as most welcome visitors but as co-workers with
all good men for the welfare of humanity.. , '. ;. ,, .Â¦-.Â¦â¢ .-Â¦ . Â¦ ' , â¢
OUR EPWORTH VISITORS.
ONLY a little while ago Mrs. Nation of Kansas was a national issue and a world-wide
curiosity. Minor judicial officers cringed under her sharp tongue like slaves under
the lash. Politicians looked at their compass and barometer every few minutes to see
on which side to get. They felt that there might arise in Kansas ."The Smashers'' as
a political party that hatchet in hand would hew its way to victory.
The Governor of the State tried to stand in executive erectness, and was reproved for not
joining Mrs. Nation by his own son, a pert lad, who draws regularly on his father for college
expenses.
Kansas has not been so stirred up since the days of John Brown and Jim Lane, ,pf Border
Ruffian and Free Soiler. If the spirit of Quantrell, the Lawrence raider, ever flits around the
scene of his pernicious activity its ghostly noddle must have been puzzled to see the difference in
principle between his way of solving problems and that of the petticoated smasher. The ven
erable Colonel Anthony of Leavenworth, whose stormy career has filled him so full of lead that'
if cremated in a smelter he would prove paying ore, found his tempestuous soul galloping like a
colt in his 85-year-old body at sight of another row and row-maker worthy of the most riot
ous days of his State, when he and Jennison the Jayhawker used to put in days shooting each
other from wagons, buggies, horseback and on foot. Even old Bender from his grave or his
hiding-place, as the case may be, must have felt that his special chapter in Kansas history was
in danger of obscuration. As the smasher approached a city the rulers thereof would treat with
her as in otter days the Mayor and council of cities from Peking to Tashkend used to treat with
Timour the Tartar, paying tribute to avoid loot.
Suddenly the whirlwind collapsed, the waterspout, burst, the earthquake ceased, the
hatchet gleamed no longer in the air and the sound of breaking mirrors was not. Mrs. Nation
was already half forgotten when from the summit of Mount Gilead, Ohio, came this news dis
patch:* "David Nation, husband of the famous Carrie Nation of Kansas, who is at the home of
"his daughter, Mrs. William Riddle, at Iberia, this county, has written the following to the pub
lic: Mrs. Nation has seen fit to leave our comfortable home in Medicine Lodge, Kans., and says
she will never return to it to live. Therefore there is nothing left for me to do but to live some
where else, as I am too old and feeble to live alone. I have decided to spend the remaining few
years allotted to me with my daughter, Mrs. William Riddle, in Iberia, Ohio. She takes good
care of me "in all my afflictions." â¢ "~"
We cordially approve the course of Mrs. Riddle in this matter. But as David has taken
the public into his conjugal and domestic confidence why does he not give a ground plan of his
many afflictions? Is the-absence or the presence of Mrs. Nation among them? The particular
statement of his present address has a sort of "donations thankfully received" appearance. Anv
way David has waxed old and is tired, and Carrie has left their happy home at Medicine Lodge.
Making a business of reform for the sake of notoriety has some features that are not attrac
tive to the thoughtful mind. â¢ ...
-DAVID IS TIRED.
Your third" question, Subscriber, is an
swered in the foregoing, and your fourth
will be recognized as unnecessary when
you remember that there are as many
"correct methods" calling- for recognition
as there are teachers.
A condition of the voice answering to
the register conception can, of course, be
brought about by the force of the sugges
tion if such be sufficiently insisted upon.
If you are constantly told that there is a
natural break between your E and P, the
break between those notes will not be long
in making its appearance: as infallibly as
it would happen that If one were con
tinually told'.that the tongue might rea
sonably refuse to pronounce the word
"cat" on account of some malformation
of that useful member the stutter at sight
of "cat" would make its suggested ap
pearance. By the same force of sugges
tion the created difficulty is smoothed
away, as when the pupil is told that by
the use of certain vocal gymnastics the
gulf in his voice can be bridged over, and
his natural intelligence reasserting itself,
the artificially created break does indeed
disappear. Voltaire once sardonically af
firmed to some pious priests who were
engaged in exorcising certain suspected
demons in some indisposed sheep, his be
lief that "incantations (and pills) would
cure any disease." His faith was evi
dently with the pills, but in the particular
matter of "registers" it is the Incanta
tions that count. The highest and lowest
notes should b* and are, when they be
come music, produced in exactly similar
fashion, including also, of course, the
notes of the middle "register."
As to the "register teaching." It is no
more a German fetich than an Italian
superstition. The mistake of arbitrarily
dividing the voice Into registers is not con
fined to any particular people, but flour
ishes wherever singers are taught to sing.
The method is a simple result of a false
mental conception, not of a natural, physi
ological law, and is one of those artificial
barriers erected by clever and dishonest
teachers (in those cases where it is not
the result of ignorance or empiricism) for
the sake of giving value to the expert as
sistance that they have to offer in the con
quering of the said difficulty.
Yes, Subscriber, there are superior re
sults to be obtained from one rather than
another system of voice culture. There
are two distinct methods in use, a bad one
and a good one, neither confined In their
exercise to Germany or Italy, not to speak
of Oakland. The human voice is the same
instrument the world over, from Paris to
Milpitas, its legitimate production the
same, and any one advertising a special
national brand of instruction in the art
is presumably a faker of the deepest dye.
It was to satisfy the eternal demand on
the part of the public to be fooled that the
fiist ingenious faker of the kind labeled
his goods Italian, or German, as the case
might be; as the artist in sardines trust
ingly titles his goods In the Gallic stylo
In spite of the patent fact that if France
were founded on sardines, mountained
with the flavorsome hors d'oeuvres arid
her shores washed by a sardine sea, she
would yet be unable to supply all the sar
dines ascribed to her that the world an
nually consumes.
A correspondent inquires: v
Firstâ In voice cultivation are there superior
results to be obtained from any one method?
That Is, has the German method anything to
offer in results superior to the Italian and
per contra?
Secondâ Is not the general "register teach
ing" recognized a German specialty?
Thirdâ Are not equal results obtained by
producing the voice in an even gamut from
the highest to the lowest notes without special
instruction as to the three registers?
Fourthâ Is the latter idea recognized as the
correct method to-day?

KELLY and Grimmins have made good their boast that they could Â£wing the Republican
State Committee to the support of their gang in local politics. The committee met yes
terday, and was made up mainly of proxies. It went through the form of listening to
arguments on behalf of the two sides to the controversy, and then, within five minutes
after the arguments closed, one of Kelly's members, McKinley of Los Angeles, drew from
his pocket and read a type-written set of resolutions setting forth that argument had been heard
and judgment given in favor of Kelly's gang.
The open revelation of the fact that the. bosses had drawn up a decision in their own favor
not only before the committee had heard argument, but even before it met, did not disconcert the
holders of a majority of the proxies. Notwithstanding the fact that the reading of a written de
cision on the question within a few^minutes after argument had been heard made every one laugh
at the rawness of the work' of the bosses, the majority of the committee stood by the programme
and adopted the decision that had been written for them.
In accomplishing this work the slum bosses have had some powerful allies. Governor Cage
was not at the meeting, nor was John C. Lynch, but the State patronage was represented by
W. F. X. Parker, expert of the State Board of Examiners, and by the water front push;, while the
Federal brigade was represented by Jacob Shaen of the Appraiser's office. Of course Herrinwas
not there, but he has now been so long and so closely identified with Martin Kelly that his pres
ence is no longer needed to indorse the boss. For many a day it has been known that wherever
Kelly Went the Herrin was sure to go.
Doubtless the bosses will claim the action of the State Committee as a great victory. There
was rejoicing in the slums and in the homes of Herrin and Gage last night Once more, to use
John Randolph's famous phrase, the combination of "the Puritan and the blackleg" had won out,
and all the predatory classes that do. politics for coin and who break into the Republican party for
about the same reasons that. a burglar enters a bank had their night of hilarity and triumph.
The victory is not going to do them much good. The primaries will not be run this year
by Kelly's toughs at Herrin's dictation. The elections are to be conducted under the law, and in
spite of the scheme of the bosses, the rank and file of the party will elect delegates to the con
vention and nominate honest candidates. ' Â¦
The issue is squarely presented now to the better elements of the Republicans of San Fran
cisco. All the bosses are in alliance. Their hypocrisy has b'een thrown aside and they are acting
now openly and defiantly in opposition to the traditions of the party and every principle of local
self-government in party affairs. If any new incentive has been needed to rouse good men to or
ganize and work for honest politics that incentive has now been furnished. Kelly and Herrin and
Crimmins and Gage have done their- worst. From this time on every point in the conflict should
end in a complete victory for honesty and genuine Republicanism.
Born bad, or mad, possessed of the devil
of self to the remotest corner of her con
sciousness and compelled \ further to a
special insanity by the prospect of. be
coming mother to a child whose father
she lothes, Ibsen's ' passionate pervert Is
the weirdest of psychological heroines!
She has an unappeasable craving for pow
er, with the most limited tools for its ex
el else. She has a pagan love of beauty
and the beautiful ever flies her touch.
Everything in her hands turns "vulgar
and mean," the inalienable characteris
tics of her own soul. She lacks the last
efficiency of even her feminine fascina
tion, and is bitter to the quick by the con
sciousness. â¢ Even the little fool, who ia
yet generous in her folly, Mrs. Elvsted,
"Hedda Gabler" is not a "nice" play.
One does not like the particular slice ol
life Ibsen exploits here. His people are
folk one would willingly walk three times
around Â£he block to miss, and the play
itself is among its author's most obscure
efforts. It is truth, oh, yes! but truth
that one would glady cut if one could. II
is a naked chunk of life cut Quivering
from the body politic with all its vital
deeps and angles' left raw to the sight
No moral purpose Is served by the' play,
no lesson taught, no problem advanced.
Ibsen seems for once neither to be as
sailing conventional "pillars of society,"
knocking down "dolls' houses," or raising
"ghosts" for our soul's benefit His mor
bid heroine Is presented "without excuse
or explanation for her being, Â¦ save that
she is, has been and always will be. It is
a pure experiment in portraiture, brilliant
and vivid, art for artls sake, and withoul
further Justification. - The character is toe
strange not to be true. That the authoi
has not seen fit to exchange truth f 01
vralsemblance is explanation of the an
gles that constantly, offend the conven
tional dramatic sense. 7 s .
It Is a far cry from "The White Heath
er" to "Hedda Gabler," yet to our credit
we have also had the latter play in the
week's repertoire. To Miss Blanche Bates'
unselfish devotion to her art, our valued
opportunity of hearing the Ibsen drama
is 'owing, and we cannot be sufficiently
grateful therefor. And there is no need
to hang heads about the audience that
greeted Miss Bates and her ponfreres on
Friday afternoon at the Columbia Thea
ter. It was a crowd that felt and fol
lowed every whisper and sense of the
play, a crowd economical of its breath
and forgetful of Its feet, an intimately
appreciative crowd that filled every chair
and corner in the theater. One can only
pray that occasion may soon arise to.
draw again such another audience to the
theater but echo and the managers an
swer, "No, sir!"
Did you see the play, Robert? Perhaps
you saw "The Great Ruby" last year by
the same authors. If so, imagine all the
things that did not happen in "The Great
Ruby" and you'll find them in "The
White Heather." The villain scales the
skies in "The Great Ruby," the big scene
being a balloon ascent with either hero
or villain done to death in an aerial duel.
In "The White Heather" the villain is
found wallowing in sin in a diving suit
at the bottom of the sea. In "The Great
Ruby" the hero sails In triumphantly on
a coal black charger; In "The White
Heather" he scorches triumphantly across
the stage on an "automobile" â no back
numbers for Messrs. Raleigh & Hamilton,
you see. They have exploited in the two
plays the heavens above, the earth be
neath and the waters under the earth. The
mise-en-scene of their next effort Â¦will ac
cordingly be of unusual interestâ probably
a case of getting off the earth altogether.
Twelve scenes "The White Heather"
boasts, and like "The Great Ruby" is a
very pretty picture drama, but that is
its sole and insufficient ralson d'etre.
A PERSON calling herself Robert
J. Sinclair, who may be a very
nice girl for all I know, writes to
complain of a criticism of E. J.
Morgan that appeared last week
in this paper. Further, she objects to Mr.
Emery of the Alcazar being criticised un
favorably for his conception of Careless
in "The School for Scandal." and aisom
quires what novice hand condemned the
work of Theodore Roberts. "
As to Theodore Roberts, Miss Robert,
his work has not been condemned in thes Â®
columns, but has been accorded the mgn
praise due the efforts of a conscientious
and gifted actor. Mr. Roberts struck the
one note of reality In the absurd carpenter
show that Frawley gave us this last
week, and I think, If you refer to Tues
day's issue of The Call, you will find tnat
such was said. You have mixed your pa
pers, Robert. About Mr. Emery's Care
less, though mine is not the particular
"novice hand" that filed the objection to
his work, I am bound to say that I auite
agree^wUh the other fellow. Mr. Emery's
Careless Is by no means up to Mr. Em
ery's standard. Careless was a gentleman
with all his faults, not a clown, and the
part Is completely out of key with the
spirit of the play as it is misconceived at
the Alcazar. T n Careless* day even^ the
"scientific and- passionate drunkard," as
Gautier phrases it, took his manners to
the tavern with him, and Careless was not
that. It was "By're leave, sir." when you
pinked your^rival, or dropped under the
table after an all-night toast to the reign
ing belle, and the courteous Careless can
by no manner of means be conceived as
becoming a boor, even though he had
drunk to every lass In the category of
contemporary charmers. Yet*Mr. Emery
makes him so. f nd if you like It that way
it's all right, but you must not expect me
to agree with you.
As to Mr. Morgan in "The WhitÂ© Heath
er," the critic seems to have chosen a
rather involved form of compliment in
poking fun at him, which, Robert, it Is
probably not all your fault that you
could not discover. Mr. Morgan is a good
actor, an actor who has done big things,
therefore, an actor who looked particu
larly foolish in trying to act a fool part
in a fool play. Still, as he found himself
there by neither ourâ the audience's â
deed, nor yet wholly through Mr. Fraw
ley's doing, it was, perhaps, his duty to
look as pleasant as possible under the
trying circumstances and act in the key
of contemptuous good nature in which
the rest of the. company ambled through
the play In . question. But Mr. Morgan
was painfully out of place, felt so and
looked it. and, moreover, didn't seem to
care ,if we knew it, though his work at
the Fame time was distinguished by all
its usual ample intelligence. Possibly
the actor did better service to his art
thereby in declining to announce himself
delighted with the role of a sawdust
dummy than was done by Theodore Rob
erts in the same paint-pot drama, Â¦when
the latter galvanized into reality the per
haps more plausible figure assigned to
him. But it's a question. Though we all
do the occasional "pot-boiler," there Is no
discernible advantage in so labeling it.
It is not respectful to the purchaser for
one thing, who prefers hia chalk and
water temptingly ticketed "Jersey
cream." though he knows and we know
that he knows we know that the mild
"moo" of the gentle Jersey has been far
from the milk bucket so scheduled. And
that, I think, is what your critic meant
to sayâ that Morgan Is a big actor with a
bad part; and, though he does it well, as
he cannot help, will yet not pretend he
thinks it worth while doing. Now, is that
so great crime to be accused of, Robert?
May you never be arraigned for more!
A PIECE OF RAW WORK, " ,
Professor Hermann Genss has accepted
a call to the directorship of the Irving
Institute Conservatory of Music and as-
Bumes charge at the beginning of the new
.
At tbe request of many musical people,
Dr. H. J. Stewart has arranged to give
two organ recitals before his departure
for Boston. The recitals will be given at
Mechanics* Pavilion on the Stanford me
morial organ and will take place on Sat
urday afternoon. July 27. and Monday
â¢vening, July 29. Dr. Stewart's pro
grammes will be selected from those
flayed by him at the Pan-American Ex
position, Buffalo. Â¦;Â¦;.â¢
The organ solos of Mr. W. F. Skeele
have also added greatly to the interest of
the festival. To-morrow evening's pro
gramme will be largely given over to an
organ recital by Mr. William B. King.
Before talcing leave of convention af
fairs, I should like again to compliment
the leaders of the various choruses on
their work. To Mr. Robert Husband. Mr.
Isaac E. Blake. Mr. J. M. Robinson, Mr
W. C Stadtfeld, Mr. F. C. Bacon, Mr. J.
J. Morris, Mr. J. C. Hill and Mr. C. M.
Vesper large credit is due for the success
ful issue of the league concert; also to
Mr. W. B. King for his excellent work as
accompanist, and to Mrs. F. J. Murdock
as pianist of the occasion.
I should like also to make reparation
here for another unfortunate suggestion
that appeared in the same criticism. As
it was worded it reads that the Stanford
organ, for which I have before an
nounced my unbounded respect, "speaks"
two seconds after striking. It should
read that by reason of the difference in.
altitude of console and organ proper, also
their distance from each other, the
sound is two seconds â as nearly as I
could gauge Itâ In traveling back to the
audience after the note is struck. A
vastly different thing. The actual differ
ence between note and answer as proved
by actual experiment is only a fraction
of a second. All organists will under
stand the full import of this. All round,
as I have before said, it is impossible to
Judge the organ in its present environ
ment. It is voiced, its volume of tone
gauged for a comparatively small room
to begin with. Were its full power al
lowed It would fill every farthest corner
of the Pavilion. It Is one of the best In
struments I ever heard, and that such
an organ can be built in California is of
the utmost artistic importance. Mr. Har
ris should build a good organ. He is a
great enthusiast in his work and has a
crew of workmen who are all more or less
Btradivariuses in their line. I don't see
why Los Angeles should not ' be the fu
ture Cremona of the organ. The Stan
ford organ is certainly a hopeful effort
in the direction.
? â¢ â¢
It seems that in my Tuesday notice of
the Epworth League concert I paid un
witting compliment to the Juanita Quar
tet of Chicago, ascribing to them the
sweet strains of the second selection of
the clever Park sisters, but the truth of
the matter Is that. In my perambulations
around the Pavilion to get the effect of
the organ and chorus from different
points. I missed the announcement of the
Juanita Quartet's non-arrival, heard only
the opening notes of "The Holy City" and
fled. "The Holy City" is without the pale,
beyond the limit of my sympathies, and
I simply won't listen to it at any price,
and that is how the mistake arose. But
I don't mind Baying that the Park girls'
unique performance would go far to make
even "The Holy City" tolerable. As a
musical curiosity, and a really enjoyable
one at that, this quartet of fair cornetists
is in the foremost rank. They obtain a
delicacy *nd grace of effect that is not
usually associated with their instrument
and phrase and color with strong musical
feeling. Technically also the perform
ance of these clever girls is quite unus
ually good and all around they are de
cidedly one of the attractions of the con
vention.
As to our very patent limitations. Of
the prospects cf a symphony orchestra it
Is of but little use to talk. The matter Is
in the irritating condition common to the
inception of the symphony in all new cit
ies. TherÂ«? are some small indications of
a renewed activity In orchestral direc
tions. It is true, but not yet of sufficient
importance to warrant rdvertisement.
The chorus is another story. If Paul
Eteindorff comes out alive at the other
end of the Tivoli grand opera season it is
reasonable to suppose from certain plans,
that I will latti exploit, that we shall
eoon have a chcrus here that will go far
to fill the present gap in our choral equip
ment. Mr. Steindorffs plan is an unusual
but not wholly new one. It has been tried
with success la New York, among other
places, end the chorus thus formed was
ultimately relied upon to furnish much of
the operatic and choral material needed
In the various musical functions of the
city. More inon.
As to * hall fit for large concerts, there
is none in the city. Sherman & Clay Hall.
Golden Gate Hall and the Native Sons'
Hall are ail well fitted for the giving of
the smaller concerts and recitals, but,
barring the Metropolitan Temple, there is
here no hall large enough for the or
chestral or choral concerts. The Mechan
ics' Pavilion, except for convention con
cert purposes. Is absolutely impossible,
and It would really seem a paying invest
ment for some one to bund, not the favor
ite new opera-house that perennially
makes its appearance on paper and which
we can do well enough without, but a
music hall for the accommodation of the
Sousas, Strausses and Scheels that hap
pen along our way. Not only such or
ganizations, but the world-famous solo
ists could be relied on for patronageâ the
GodowskyÂ», Pafierewskis, Carrenos, Tre
bellis, YsayeÂ» and people of that ilk, who
are now compelled to engage the theaters
as the only places large enough to accom
modate their audiences. The music hall
ehould also have a good pipe organ as an
indispensable musical adjunct, and, fur
ther, as another source of revenue from
the recitals on the instrument. That such
a hall would not here end its usefulness
may be readily imagined, and It is to be
hoped that the almost certain pecuniary
success of the venture will shortly per
suade some public spirited citizen to In
vest thus some of his idle capital.
There Is the usual questioning as
to why we have here no oratorio society;
why there is no fitting house of sons in
the city; why the large organ, so essential
to chorus accompaniment, is conspicuous
by :ts absence from available halls, and,
lastly, why there is no symphony oiches
tra to add the final grace to the great
choruses in which man has hymned his
GodÂ» On the other hand, the Ep worth
League concerts have proved again that
there is here all the vocal material neces
sary for the grand chorus; that the musi
cal spirit is abundantly present; t'.iat we
have organists and leaders fully capable
of their work. aDd, further, that we can
build an excellent organ within the State
linesâ a showing not to be despised for a
fifty-year-old youngster of a city.

TOPEKA, Kans., July 20.â Kansas has
had another day of the protracted heat,
with llttl-3 prospects of immediate relief.
One or two small showers fell In Central
Kansas, but the skies over the remainder
of the State were cloudless. Numerous
cities have now completed thirty days
with only a trace of rain.
The State Is again encountering the se
vere heat that was present before the re
cent period of low barometer, when a
number of cities were relieved by rain.
At Ottawa, In the eastern part of the
State, a temperature of 108 is reported.
There the river is drying up and the city
will soon be without water.
In the district around Concordia the
heat was withering, causing a number of
prostrations. In Leavenworth the tem
pprature was 107.' This was about the
average for the entire State.
Corn, which had fairly good prospects
a week ago, is beginning to tassel out
and this will prove its destruction. The
slight rains of a few days since freshened
the cereal and helped it to grow a littlo

BOSTON, July 20.â Governor Charles H.
Allen of Porto Rico reached this city lata
last night on the yacht Mayflower, but
the fact did not become known till to-day
because the Governor directed the yacht
to stop down the channel while he took a
launch and landed in time to catch tha
midnight train for Washington.
This morning, 'with all the appearance
of having Just arrived, the Mayflower
steamed up to the navy yard and ex
changed salutations with Rear Admiral
Sampson. When inquiry was made for
Governor Allen it was stated that he had
gone to Washington, Later the clever plan
pursued by the Governor in making quids
time toward "Washington was learned.
Mrs. Allen, who accompanied her hus
band, did not leave the ship until this
afternoon. She went to the Allen home
In Lowell, where she expects Allen to Join
her in a few days.

mander James N. Adams, left San Juan

Toronto Oarsmen Easily

Vespers.
The dual contest for the championship
of the United States in the singles was
not as inspiring as was hoped for, and
the honor will remain with the wonderful
Ten Eyck another year at least. Ten
Eyck's sculling was just as finished as
ever it was, and his grand handling of
the sculls was cheered to the echo. Greer,
his opponent, rowed a plucky race, and
no matter how he tried to push to the
front, the winner of the diamond sculls
held him safely throughout the race.
Between 30,000 and 50,000 people saw the
races. The weather was beautiful and the
course was as smooth as the proverbial
mill pond. The high banks of the Schuyl
kill River were lined with enthusiastic
crowds, and thousands braved the dan
ger of the railroad bridge at the finish
line and swarmed all over the structure.
It was the first defeat for the Vesper
eight. Their Waterloo did not come as
a surprise to the experts who have fol
lowed their work during this season, and
many were the predictions that in the
men from Toronto and Winnipeg they
would meet their match. With the excep
tion of two men the Vesper crew was the
same as that which wrested the victory
from, the world's oarsmen at Paris last
year. The Argonaut's time for the mile
and a half was 7:49, just ten seconds
slower than the time made by the Vespers
over the same course In a race last year.
Winnipeg's time was 7:53% and the-Ves
pers' 7:06.
PHILADELPHIA, July 20.â The world's
champion Vesper eight-oared shell crew
of this city, which has carried the colors
of its club to many a victory, went down
to defeat to-day before the strong
Argonaut crew of Toronto, Canada, in the
last day of the annual regatta of the
National Association of Amateur Oars
men. Not only was this crew whipped by
the Canadians, but the eight men of the
Winnipeg Rowing Club also flashed past
the champions and beat them out at the
finish. .

Marshal Thomas Price was Instantly

The officers returned the flre, but the

and carried Mackey with them. One

"Auntie Kruger" Is what she was called
by her people of the Transvaal. It was
often told of her when any one men
tioned her husband's wealth she -would
confide to them that her husband and
.ghe never lived beyond their "coffee
money," $2000 a year, which they got from
the Government. ,
â¢ -Mrs. Kruger was the mother of sixteen
children. Her daughters all married
wealthy burghers, and most of her sons
took an interest in the army. She and
the President lived in a modest little two
story cottage painted white and covered
with morning glory vines.
"When the British took Pretoria, and the
President fled, he left Mrs. Kruger in the
city. She was sick when he left for Eu

were then with her. Despite some losses
in the family, at last reports the couple
had thirty-one sons and grandsons in the

NEW YORK, July 20.â General Rafael
Uribe-Uribe, leader of the Liberal party
in the United States of Colombia, has
given the detectives who were watching
him the. slip and the party in power in
the southern republic, which is believed to
be his destination, is preparing for
trouble. Of all contemporary revolution
ary leaders in South American states Gen
eral Uribe, with his long record of daring
victories unmarred by defeat, is the most
famous.
Among General Urlbe's flriends in this
city it is whispered that he has gone to
Costa Rica, and that his objective point
is Panama, in Colombia. That the Co
lombian Government credits this report
is shown by the fact that it has pur
chased two new guns to be used in de
fending Panama harbor andys preparing
to give him a warm reception.
General Uribe came to this country
from Caracas last January. It was said
then the purpose of his visit was to pur
chase a war vessel with which to extend
revolutionary operations to the sea coast.
He himself gave no explanation of his
visit, but he had his mail sent to the
Colombian consulate and left nothing un
done to create the impression that hos
tilities were to cease in Colombia, at least
for a time. He even went to Washington,
where he had a conference with Carlos
Martinez Silva, Colombian Minister to the
United States, after which he Issued a
manifesto In which he said that the lime
was inopportune, in his opinion, for prose
cuting the war against the Government
of President Jose Manuel Marroquln, who
had usurped office by the coup d'etat of

a short illness.
Mrs. Kruger was the second wife of the
Transvaal President. ' She was Miss du

Mrs. Kruger was a- typical Boer woman.
She cared nothing for finery. In the days
of prosperity at her home in Pretoria she
had all the simplicity of manner and mode

show: "In all California why is there no

only place where you can have a great

say that this brought down the house. It

HONOLULU, July 10.â The House and
Senate are both very near the end of their
work now. The conference committees
have agreed upon most of the Items to be
inserted in the appropriation bills, and' it
Is thought that all that remains i3 the
closlng-up work of the session.
An extra session Is again being talked
of. Treasurer Wright has calculated that
the Territory will be $1,000,000 short at the
end of the two-year period now begun un
less some additional measures to raise
revenue are enacted. The -matter of
granting an extra session -was discussed
in the Executive Council, and it is report
ed that three of the heads of departments
favored it, but Acting Governor Cooper
and Attorney General Dole were opposed.
President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University, who has charge of the
United States Jchthyological expedition to
these islands, has nearly completed his
work here. He will leave here on July
16 on his return to Stanford. He will be
relieved here by Dr. Jenkins, who occu
pies the chair of physiology at Stanford,
as the work of the expedition here is not
finished yet. Dr. Jenkins was here in 1S89,
when he made one of the largest collec
tions of flsh from these waters.
The Honolulu Chamber . of Commerce
has- appointed a committee to look after
the matter of contesting the new income
tax law, which went into . effect this
month. A large number of local business
men are behind the movement and the
law will be vigorously fought. In addi
tion to the 'alleged flaws In the law as it
stands, grounds for contest may be found
in the use of the English and Hawaiian
languages in the Legislature, which, it is
claimed by some, made all its proceedings
invalid, as the organic act declared for
the use of English. .The Income tax case
may therefore test the validity of the
legislative acts of the present session in

E. Lastreto of the committee on music
said it was decided to have two bands to
accompany the parlors from Native Sons"
Hall ,to the railroad depot on the night
of the 8th of September; also that if any
of the San Francisco parlors will have
their own band accompany them such
bands will, .in all probability, be engaged
by the San Jose committee to give con
certs In the parks in the Garden City. : -
James L. Gallagher suggested that the
parade in this city on the night of the
8th should be on the lines of.- the previous
celebrations to draw attention to the fact
that there is to be a celebration in San
Jcse.
E. D. Crowley said that the entire mem
bership of Army and Navy Parlor will be
in the parade on the day of the big turn
out.
The representatives of a number of the
local parlors announced that' they had se
cured headquarters and will do all in their
power to make the celebration a success.
It â¢was decided that each parlor shall
have not less than ten members in the
parade in San Francisco.
Chairman Dockery announced that
about $6000 has already been contributed
to the San Jose committee; that the cele
bration will be a three-day one, and that
many novel features will be introduced.
He also said that many parlors In the
vicinity of San Jose have signified their
intention of joining in the celebration.
The committee then adjourned for two
weeks.

It was from this office that on June
29 a large number of circular letters were
sent to attorneys throughout the State
calling their attention to the law and In
viting attorneys to drum up business for
the firm of Taylor & Mason, in whose en
velopes the letters were inclosed. The
circular letter outlines what the future
actions of the courts would be and con
cludes by strongly urging on the attor
neys to hurry up and send in all the con
tracts possible, particularly specifying
the amount that each saloon-keeper was
willing to contribute to get out of his
quarterly license payments. A copy of
this letter is now in possession of The
Call. Mr. Taylor may deny the evidence
if he wills, but the proof is forthcoming.
Denials seem to be a favorite means of
tiding over the difficulty of a proper ex
planation with Mr. Taylor. He was inter
viewed by a representative of the Oakland
Enquirer and is reported to have said that
two months ago he had been consulted
about the effect of the new law and was
of the opinion that it takes away from
the County Boards of Supervisors the
power of licensing for revenue, but knew
nothing about it before that time.
Assemblyman Kelley says he introduced
the bill at the request of Senator Taylor
of Alameda. "but does not know positive
ly where the bill really did come from,
for he introduced so many." While Sen
ator Taylor disputes the official record
and disclaims having had anything to do
with the bill, which Kelley says he in
troduced at Taylor's request, a few later
developed facts that have a strong bear
ing on the Inside history have just come
to light.
TIES. H. A. MASON. Secretary.
"CALIFORNIA MUNICIPALITIES."
E. K. TAYLOR.
According to the most reliable reports
H. A. Mason, secretary of the California
League of Municipalities, was . the one
who Induced Assemblyman Kelley to in
troduce the bill in the Assembly, through
which it passed on March 7 and was read
in the Senate the next day, amended on
the 11th and passed on the 13th, less than
a week from the time It reached Taylor's
committee.
Now Taylor and Mason occupy rooms
in the Mills building, on the eighth fiOor.
On the door Is inscribed:
LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA MUNICIPALI-
When Senator E'. K. Taylor of Alameda,
through his home papers, is loud In his
protestations of innocence regarding the
passage of Assembly bill No. 456, regard
ing the regulation of liquor licenses In all
counties in the State outside of San Fran
cisco, further investigation discloses the
fact that on his shoulders must rest the
burden of proof. "While the bill was in
troduced by Assemblyman Kelley of Oak
land, it was on the report of the Senate
Committee on Municipal Corporations, of
which Senator E. K. Taylor was. chair
man, that the "phony" amendments were
introduced.
In the Alameda Encinal, Taylor is
quoted as saying: . â¢
I had nothing to do with this bill. It was
Introduced by Kelley In the Assembly and was
known as the "Davis bill." From The Call's
article it would be inferred that -I introduced
it into the Senate, which is untrue. I had
nothing whatever to do with its introduction
or passage.
Either Senator Taylor's memory is de
fective or else there is a gross error in
the Senate journal of March 11, 1901. For
there ie a report from the Committee on
Municipal Corporations reading as fol
lows:
Mr. Presidentâ Tour Committee on Municipal
corporations, to whom was referred Assembly
Bill No 456â An act to add a new section to
the Political Code of the State of California,
to be known as section 4045. relating tp the
powers qf Boards of Supervisors, City Councils
and Ttfrvn Trustees In their respective coun
ties, cities and towns, and to impose a license
tax, at a rate to be fixed annually by them
upon certain named persons, occupations and
business â have had the same under considera
tion, and respectfully report the same back,
and recommend that it do pass as amended.
TAYLOR, Chairman.
The bill was then ordered on file for
second reading. A few hours later Senator
Taylor asked for and was granted
unanimous consent to take up Assembly
bill No. 456 for immediate consideration.
During the second reading of the bill the
five amendments were submitted by the
committee, of which Senator Taylor- was
the chairman, and adopted.
â¢ Outdoes the Charity Concert.
The principal amendments were the
fourth and fifth, by which the mate
rial Intent of the act was altered
by the striking out of the words
'"and revenue." This, as has already been
explained in The Call, has resulted -in
placing the matter of collecting liquor
licenses in the hands of the foster fathers
of the bill instead of the Boards of Su
pervisors as heretofore. Just how long
this game could be continued would en
tirely depend upon the gullibility of the
saloon-keepers and thÂ© plausibility of the.
bill-promoters. As a money-making
scheme it would outdo any charity con
cert proposition.

ACTIVITY PREVAILS
IN PBIMABY LEAGUE
The Republican Primary League is not
in the slightest degree disturbed by the
Interference of the State Central Â¦ Com
mittee in local affairs. The promoters of
the league anticipated the conflict between
the Bouvier and Tilden County, commit
tees and resolved to establish an anti-bosg
organization independent of both factions.
The league is carrying out the purposes
of its founders. Anti-boss clubs are es
tablished in the [ several Assembly dis
tricts of San Francisco and citizens are
enrolling their names ~ and pledging their
support to the cause of good local gov
ernment under Republican auspices. In
numerical strength, quality of member
ship and- general influence the league
clubs hold by far the leading place. The
Tilden committee rooms, where Kelly and
Crimmins roost, were deserted as usual
last night.- Reputable Republican citizens
will not visit the boss headquarters. â¢ The
Republican State Central Committee, in
cluding the Los Angeles and Santa Rosa
delegations, may meet every day In the
week and adopt typewritten resolutions of
sympathy for Kelly- and Crimmins, but
bossism will not be rendered more accept
able by such Indorsement. People of San
Francisco, irrespective > of party, regard
the intrusion of the State Central Com
mittee into municipals affairs as absurd,
unwarranted and pernicious: Â¦ .
J. W. McKinley, the Los Angeles lawyer
who made a grotesque spectacle of him
self in producing the boss programme for
the. State Central Committee, is said to
be a candidate for the , Supreme bench.
His blunder yesterday was the common
topic of comment in political circles last
ntght. It was called to mind that Jeffer
son James, who* was once nominated for
Mayor, produced from his pocket a speech
accepting the nomination and began read
ing: "This is unexpected." It was said
of .his subsequent campaign that he ran
third in the race because there was not a
fourth candidate. Los Angeles should get
ready to present another candidate for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
one who will not render decisions before
listening to argument.
Until a late hour last night the rooms
of the Republican Primary League, ' 930
Market street, were crowded with Jreso
lute citizens, who have entered the muni
cipal campaign to prevent the predatory
bosses from looting the municipality. The
work of district organization and enroll
ment of the anti-boss iorces will go for
â¢ward with increased vigor on account of
the >' unwarranted attempt of the State
Central Committee to establish a reign of
bossism and municipal plunder in this
city. . In the approaching contest'no half
way ground will be found for independent
clubs,- organized- to help this or that can
didate to a friendly Â¦ delegation. Individ
ual aspirations must be subordinated to
the common welfare.
â¢Â¦ The fight is on between the people on
one side and the allied looters . on the
other. Twenty-two days remsJn to organ
ize all the forces of good citizenship for
the important struggle on August 13 next.
"I soon discovered there was nothing in
tins county for any one on this proposi
tion for this reason: The Oakland license
is $100 a quarter, and the county license
before the passage of this act was S30 a
quarter. The county license was never
collected In Oakland, although the law
said it should be. Soon after the passage
of the Kelley bill, the liquor men saw
the state of affairs and petitioned the
Board of Supervisors to reduce the coun
ty license, and in accordance with that
petition it was reduced to $5 per quarter.
"When I spoke to these men about the
Taylor proposition, they said it would not
pay them to get into any litigation and
that it was better to pay $5 than to pay a
lawyer. I understand the matter waÂ»
taken up later by another party and
about thirty-five contracts were signed.
"There is nothing in working it in Ala
meda County, because the $5 license
knocks it out; but they have worked every
county in the State, and in such places
as Sacramento and Los Angeles- it is a
good thing. Mr. Mason, being in ' the
League of Municipalities, was undoubted
ly in a position to appoint agents in each
county to handle the matter, he being well
known throughout the State.
natural starting point for the scheme.
Kelley hails frcm Oakland and Taylor
from Alameda city. A former local offi
cial of Oakland was approached and ask
ed if he wanted to make some money.
He had been interested in Oakland poli
tics, was thoroughly conversant with the
ins and outs and was deemed a good man
to quietly launch the scheme. Besides
he had been in Sacramento during the
session of the Legislature, and was sup
posed to be up to snuff. He admits that
he was approached by Taylor and those
Interested in pushing the matter.
"Taylor is a good fellow," he said, "and
I would do pretty' near anything for him.
I was approached about two months ago
by, him and asked 'if I wanted to make
some money. I was told just about what
The Call said a few days ago. I was told
if I would canvass the liquor dealers of
Alameda County and get them to sign
the contractâ the one printed In The Call
âI. would be properly treated. I said I
would look into the matter and let them
know later. I saw a number of the lead
ing dealers.'
Deputy Auditor Leary is not much Im
pressed with the ability of the ordinary
clerks seat by the commission to work on
the books.. Leary believes there is collu
sion among them because during two days
only forty-seven pages of the books have
been footed. up, where, last year sixteen
volumes were ready for the expert on the
second day. Leary believes the clerks are
taking advantage of an order he issued
that the clerks should not rush their. work
but to be sure their, figures were accurate.

' ASA R. WELLS, Auditor.
To the Hon. Civil Service Commission: In
compliance with your request of i
have decided to dismiss the fifteen experienced
clerks appointed by me to assist the twenty-flve
ordinary clerks appointed by you for temporary
work on the assessment roll In this office. I
do this not because I believe you have the right

I am tired of continual harassing in of flea.
The two commissioners named, together
with Chief Examiner Moran, Commission
er McCarthy being conspicuous by his ab
sence, visited the Auditor, and, after pre
liminary juggling, flatly informed him. that
his request for the privilege of appoint
ing fifteen clerks not on the civil service
list would be denied. Of course/neither
Freud nor Quinn were aware that Mc-
Carthy had succeeded in securing the ap
pointment of a protege, thus aiding a
palpable violation of the civil service
clause in the charter. There was nothing
left for Wells to . do but to dismiss the
fifteen clerks and he did so, not, however,
before sending the following caustic let
ter to the commission:
"When the Auditor was authorized by the
Board of Supervisors to appoint forty ex
tra clerks to foot up the assessment roll he
made a requisition on the commission for
twenty-five, ordinary clerks and sent a
communication to it requesting that he
be allowed tc/ appoint fifteen experienced
clerks of his own selection on account of
the intricate nature of the work. Expect
ing that the request would be complied
with, Wells put fifteen clerks to work. One
of these was a' young woman whom Civil
Service Commissioner McCarthy had ask
ed Wells to appoint after another person
had interested himself in her behalf.
Wells complied with the request, but Com
missioners Freud and Quinn, who were
ignorant of their colleague's little political
deal, blocked the scheme.
The fact that Civil Service Commis
sioner P. H. McCarthy has been appointed
by Mayor Phelan to carry out the merit
system as laid- down In the charter does
not prevent that official from being a
party to an evasion of civil service. Aud
itor Wells had another clash with the
commission yesterday over the appoint
ment by him of fifteen experienced clerks
who were not on the eligible list and it de
veloped that McCarthy had stood sponsor
for one of the clerks whom the commis
sion forced the Auditor to dismiss because
they were not certified by it for appoint
ment.

to date In the summer school at the Uni
versity of California has reached thÂ© as
tonishing total of 7S9. This is nearly double
that of last year, when 443 students con
stituted the school, then considered one
of remarkable size.
Facts regarding this year's session are
unusual. Of the total number registered
twelve are at work In the marine biolog
ical laboratory at San Pedro and the re
maining- 777 are at Berkeley. Of those at
Berkeley 326 are men and 451 women.
Their varying occupations are as follows:
Teachers, 401; school superintendents, 5;
enrolled students from University. 177;
from other institutions, 84; farmers, 8;
chemists, 4; clergymen, 5; business men, 3:
clerks, lawyers, miners, railroad conduc
tors, 2 each; and one printer, accountant,
pharmacist and civil engineer. The aver
age age of the students is 27% years. Nine
teen" States besides California are repre
sented by students, as well as Chile, Brit
ish Columbia and Hawaii. Graduates from
two dozen different American universities
and from Oxford are In attendance. Only
eleven counties In thi3 State are unrepre

The present summer school la thÂ© larg
est in the history of California and in
size and importance has reached beyond
the expectations of the University au

ADVERTISEMENTS.â¢ SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE PROMINENT AT THE MEETING OF THE REPUBLICAN STATE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE AT GOLDEN GATE HALL YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, AT WHICH THE TILDEN COUNTY
CENTRAL COMMITTEE WAS DECLARED TO HAVE AUTHORITY. ,
What are you all called here for, some of you
hundreds of miles? To decide which Is the
CÂ«unty Committee? Npt at all. What differ
ence does it make which of these committees
is declared to be the .Qounty Committee? Both
of them go out of existence with this next con
vention. Is It to recognize a regular ticket?
Is It to recognize party discipline and party
organization? There are parties, members of
this very State Central Committee, who are
here to-day to vote upon this proposition who
went out openly and talked and voted for the
defeat of the .regular nominees of the Repub
lican party at the last election, and they are
certainly not here to vote according to their
honest Judgment as a matter of party dis
cipline to hold Republicans In line; men who
Abe Ruef occupied the entire thirty min
utes allotted to the other side. ' After deal

minutes.
Augustus Tilden, as chairman of the
protesting . committee, came forward to
represent that side. He spoke fifteen minr
utes, going into the history of the two
committees and the "vexatious apportion
ment." He modestly referred to his com
mittee as "the committee of which Mr.
Tilden is chairman" whenever he had oc
casion to speak of it,- and that was often.
in a^False Position.
Van Duzer Says It Is Being Placed
A. P. Van Duzer objected strenuously
to the part of the resolutions which de
clared the Bouvier committee to be with-
ADMINISTRATION 1 WARNED.
This decision Is the decision In writing of
the said State Central Committee contemplated
and required in ,the' premises by and Is ren
dered in accordance with and by. virtue of sec
tion 1186 of the Political Code of California,
and shall be attested by the secretary of said
State Central Committee, and a duplicate
thereof shall be filed by said secretary with the
Board of Election Commissioners of said city
and county not later than 9 o'clock a. m. of
tho 22d day of July, 1901.
It Is further found, decided and determined
that said body of which Alfred Bouvier is
chairman and J. F. McGlynn is secretary does
not represent and is not the governing com
mittee of nor has It at any time or period
herein mentioned represented or been the gov
erning committee of said party In said city
and county, but the said body is and at all
times and oeriods herein mentioned haa been
without standing or4.uthority to represent said
party In said territory or any part thereof.
Whereas, It has been brought to the at

Republican party : of; California that there ex
ists; In -the city and. county of San. Francisco
two bodies claiming to represent said Repub
lican party in said city and county as the
governing committees thereof, of one of which
bodies Alfred Bouvier, Esq., is chairman, and
J. FÂ» McGlynn, Esq., is secretary, and of the
other of which . bodies Augustus Tilden,' Esq.,
Is chairman, and A. B. Mahoney, Esq., is sec
retary, the said State Central Committee hav
ing on this -20th day of July, 1901," convened In
special meeting regularly called for the pur
pose of hearing the claims of said bodies and
dstermirlng and deciding which thereof repre
sents said party In said territory, -and said
bqdles having appeared before said State Cen
tral Committee at said time by their respec
tive chairmen and counsel, and the State Cen- x
tral" Committee having heard the proofs ad
duced and argruments made for and on behalf
of the respective bodies and having fully con
sidered the name, now therefore, it is by th<Â»
said State Central Committee found, decided
and determined that said body of which Au
gustus Tilden. Esq., is chairman, and A. / B.
Mahony, Esq., is secretary, represents and
continuously since the 1st day of January, 190L
has represented said Republican party in said
city and county, and is and continuously since
said 1st day of January, 1901, has been thÂ«
governing committee thereof, and said Au
gustus Tilden and A. B. Mahony are hereby
found and decided to be and are hereby named
as the chairman and secretary thereof, re
spectively.
A. B. Truman toofc* the platform and
made a pyrotechnic speech, denouncing
the Bouvier committee. He asserted his
allegiance to the Grand Hotel wing o'f the
party. Afterward he voted the Martin
Kelly programme, for himself and the
members whose proxies he held.
Senator Corlett hit Truman a solar
plexus by objecting to his further waste
of -the committee's time. V Truman sub

voted against State Senators, . who have the
nomination and election" of a United States
Senator. . and who voted for Democrats, should
not come here and tell us that they are voting
for .party discipline and party organization.
The di.ttrence of opinion here is whether the
Republicans of San Francisco shall b* "^pre
sented In a municipal convention" 1 for the pur
pose of nominating a Mayor and other mu
nicipal officers by 301 Republicans or 351. If
there is any other question involved . In this
case now I am willing to aayj that we will
withdraw our petition and we will allow the
Tilden committee's apportionment to stand. I
do not wish to say why the Tilden committee's
apportionment is better or worse than ours.
That Is, a matter with which you gentlemen
have, no concern and about which I do not care
to argue. But that is the sole question that
is before you. - : â¢ " .' ." .
Â« A proposition, was made before . either com
mittee acted that the committees should agree
upon an apportionment. But it is bruited about
on every street corner and boasted of in every
barroom in San Francisco where politicians
congregate that this committee will decide that
ths Tilden committee is the committee. I. do
not say that they _will, -but that is the report.
Are you going to take up that question here
and decide it and wantonly " break up the Re
publican party of San Francisco by unwar
ranted interference which will redound to the
disadvantage of the party in future State cam
paigns? I am as good a Republican as stands
upon this floor, and I I wanted to avoid any
question of this kind and the necessity of
having: it determined by. you gentlemen from
the interior, as well as my 'distinguished con
freres upon this committee from San Francisco.
The latter are here in full force. and are ready
to vote according to the dictates of their con
sciences; and they have eighteen aggregate con
sciences which will vote with singular unanim
ity. Some of them hold places', on the water
front and some of them hold places elsewhere,
and they can't vote for themselves: if they had
a conscience they couldn't vote according to
it,'. because they are afraid of losing their Jobs.
You will have the Republican party broken into
pieces unless you establish a uniform law.
I .am going to vote the ticket nominated by
the convention, no matter whether the Tilden
committee or the Bouvier committee or the
Republican Primary League prevails. . I am
going to stand by the party better than some
of these gentlemen who are talking about party
organization and party discipline. I reserve
the right only that if the nominations of the
'party are. of such a debased character that a
man cannot in justice to his own self-respect
vote for them I am not obliged to support
them, even to oblige the bosses. But I am
willing, upon any fairly good Republican con
vention, to say that I do not care which fac
tion controls if it nominates a ticket la the

TATYK OF PLAIN DUTY.
Committee Eefuses to Leave Question
to Decision of Election Com
missioners.
Chairman Stone declared a quorum
present and after the reading of the call
for the meeting and of the communication
from Augustus Tilden and A. B. Mahoney
which led to the meeting being called,
Colonel Stone said it was apparent that
the committee had a plain duty to per
form and called for discussion. Â¦
J. "W. Knox of Merced moved that no
action be taken and the question be left
for the Election Commissioners to decide.
A. P. Van Duzer seconded the motion,
and it was j promptly voted down. ", .
On motion of A. B. Lemmon, after.' a
hurried conference with J. W. McKinley,
it was decided to limit each side to thirty
farther and practically proclaimed that
Republicans of any organization other
than that controlled by the bosses were
unworthy of recognition. The . issue Is
therefore brought directly before the peo
ple of San Francisco.
The session was enlivened by several
ludJcrous incidents. The master of cere
mo*i'es was Judge J. "W. McKinley of Loa
Angeles. His right hand supporter was
Walter F. X. Parker of Los Angeles, who

THE rawest programme ever de

ried out to the letter by the Re
publican State Central Committee
at Golden Gate Hall yesterday.
When boss orders were given for assem

nounced that the sole purpose of the pro
posed meeting was to give the local
bossesâ Crlmmins and Kellyâ an endorse
ment to save them from utter defeat and
demoralization. The prediction is verified.
. The proceedings at Golden Gate Hall
yesterday afternoon demonstrated the fact
clearly that State officeholders were under
orders to line up behind Kelly and Crlm

to conceal Governor Gage's endorsement
of the boss programme. The agents of
bossism were not satisfied with endorsing

Proxies were appointed as follows:
Roars of laughter greeted the suggestion
of A. Ruef that the Judge must have had
a typewriting machine concealed about
his clothing in order to have produced the
resolution so soon after, the argument was
finished. It was obvious to the dullest
observer of events that the resolution waa
prepared and typewritten long before the
committeemen had listened to a word of
the argument on the question.
The postmaster of Santa Rosa and Wal
ter Parker of Los Angeles, who are tak
ing such absorbing interest in the munici
pal affairs of San Francisco,, were on the
alert to render McKinley assistance.
When the talk about the outrageous in
trusion of the committee won from the
fair-minded Republicans cheering ap
plause the Santa Kosa postmaster moved

did not want to hear the plain, unvar
nished truth from A. P. Van Duzer, A.

Senators Thomas Flint and Robert Cov
lett. -.
Martin Kelly was on hand to see that
his henchmen did not falter. Judge Dib
ble was there, but did not participate in
the proceedings. He was tendered a proxy
but declined it. The mess was too raw
for the Judge to swallow. Johnny Mac
kenzie of Santa Clara and Max Goldberg
of this city sat together and looked
pleased. There Is nothing In a slaughter
house too raw for either of them- Jesse
Marks, "Corney" Pendleton, Jake Shaen,
ex-Assemblymen Rickard, Fisk and "Col
onel" Brady graced the occasion. Boss
Kellv surveyed the bunch with & glow of
delight. There Is not the slightest doubt
that D. M. Burns gave orders for his fol
lowers to get 'in behind Kelly and Crim
mlnn, because E. I. Robinson, who gets
Burns' permission to breathe, voted a
bunch of proxies for the Kelly programme.
Colonel George Stone called the meeting

tary, called the roll. The following mem

aminers. His left hand supporter was Al

Rosa. All three were stuffed with proxies.
It was noted that Judge McKinley held
the proxy of Orestes Orr of Ventura.
Judge McKinley arrived from Los An
geles Friday. He and Walter Parker met
the chairman of the State Committee at
the Palace Friday evening. The formal
resolution endorsing the Tilden committee
was revised and adopted that evening. A
typewritten copy was placed in Judge Mc-
Kinley's pocket. Five minutes after the
argument was concluded yesterday the
Judge drew from his pocket the resolution
and read it. When he came to the words
"having listened to the argument" the
anti-boss members exchanged smiles.

Robert R. Grayson was ( born in Red
Bluff, Teb'ama County, thirty-five years
ago. He was educated at Harvard and
was proficient in the Greek classics. He
was a popular member of the Vaciflc-
Union Club and of the Elks. He was en
gaged to marry Miss Jennie Dunphy and
the- wedding was to have ' taken place in
the fall.,. .â¢
- With the passing of "Bob" Grayson, as
he was popularly called, another familiar
figure will be missed "along the line." He
was a man of most generous Impulses and
was a true bohemian In every sense of
the word.: He was a universal favorite,
and his company was much In demand by
his. bachelor friends on account of his
bright and clever conversational powers.
He was passionately fond of all athletic
sports.
The funeral will take place on Monday
afternoon from the late residence of the
deceased in Oakland, the services being in
charge of the Elks, members of San Fran
cisco Lodge No. 3 performing the last sad
rites. .
Mr. Grayson attended the Pacific-Union
Club last Friday night' and was. in more
than usual good humor. His father,
George W. Grayson, capitalist, with of
fices at 331 Pine -street., missing his son
from his office in the forenoon called yes
terday after lunch at the flat, 393 Geary
street, to see what had detained him. Re
ceiving no response to his summons, he
called the landlady and an entrance was
effected with a pass key. ,llr. Grayson
lay in bed, apparently asleep. A closer
inspection revealed the fact that he was
dead, or apparently so. Dr. BurKess was
summoned in haste and. declared that
death had occurred a few hours pre
viously.
Robert R. Grayson, mining operator and
of tha firm of Ralston & Grayson, 331 Pine
street, died suddenly and unexpectedly
yesterday morning at his lodgings, 393

the best of health and spirits recently, and
his death came as a shock to his many
friends, who had not known that he was
suffering from a mortal disease.

Van Duzer Insisted upon the-considera

vious question, moved by A. B. Lemmon,
the "Van Duzer amendment was lost by
a vote of eight ayes to fifty noes. The
vote was "not a test : of", the relative
strength of the two sides, but the Bouvier
element saw the futility of further oppo
sition, and rollcall was not demanded on
the question of the adoption of the reso

adopted and. the purpose of the meeting

Bad Circulation is the cause of most of the ills that come with old age. With
advancing yearo there is a decline of strength and vigorâ the machinery of the
body moves "with less speed and accuracy. Because of the weak and irregular
action of the heart the blood moves more slowly, becomes impure and loses much
of its life-sustaining properties, and muscles, tissues and nerves literally starve for
lack of nourishment. A sluggish and polluted circulation is followed by a long
train of bodily ailments. Cold feet, chilly sensations up and down the spine, poor
appetite and digestion, soreness of the muscles, rheumatic pains, hard and fissured
skin, face sores, chronic running ulcers on the lower, limbs and other parts of the
body â these and many other diseases peculiar to old people are due to a lack of
healthy blood and imperfect circulation. Restoration to health must come through
the building up and purification of the blood, thus adding strength and tone to
the vital organs and quick, healthy action to the circulation. â¢ . s .

TO ARRIVE.
The Kimball will sail for Nome again
next Wednesday, and nearly all- of -her
passenger accommodations have already
been taken. . . . , . -
Although the Kimball "bucked" the ice
like the rest of the fleet, she does not
show a trace of the contact. Before the
floes were reached the steamship's stem
was boarded over and the planks thus put
on bore the brunt, of the attack upon the
ice. The steamship Conemaugh'was at
Nome when the Ktmball sailed from that
port. Not an ounce of her cargo below
the hatches had been discharged, ' but
some livestock that -went up as a-deck
load had been landed. \
THE Dollar Steamship Company's
John Â¦ â¢ S. Kimball arrived - from
Nome yesterday. ; She was the first
vessel ,of the fleet to reach Teller,
and Captain Timing found many
of the people who < had wintered there on
| the verge of scurvy. : Everybody clam
j ored for potatoes, and luckily the Kim
ball was able to supply the' demand.
; One of the handsomest match ' boxes
i ever seen on a ship was presented to Cap
tain Thwing by the passengers '.who went
north on the Kimball. It is made of Nome
gold and around the edge is a rim of 'nug
gets! On the lid is a nugget shaped, into
a spreadeagle and en one side is the fol
lowing inscription: ' < .
! " "Presented -to Milton Thwing
by passengers on steamship John S. Kim
ball, Sari Ffariclsro to Nome, June, 1901."
On the other side Captain '.Timing's
monogram is engraved and below it are
; the spade and shovel supporting thVpan.
In the center of the pan Is set a magnifi
cent diamond. Accompanying the. matclr
box was a " testimonial^thanking Captain
Thwing for his care and* attention* and'
praising the accommodations on -the John
S. Kimball. -n.^ . - \ Â«â¢<?**" â¢ .- 'Â«#
Captain, .ThwaQg .reppVts that'Jthe^ St,' ;
Paul was damaged.' when she went on tW
beach at St. Michael -and- will have to'
drydock here for- an overhauling.. The
Alaska Commercial Company's tug Sad'e
and steamer Dora got her off the beach.
The Roanoke stove in one of .the -plates
In her. bow while making her way through
the ice. A considerable portion of 'her
cargo was damaged. The Jeanle r had her
rudder post ripped off by an icefloe." Cap
tain Mason managed to fix things up with
a portion' of his steel rigging and when
he got to Dutch Harbor he put the steam
ship on the beach and made the neces-
sary repairs. The Ruth . went on the
beach at Golofnin and was considerably
damaged/ The Santa Ana blew Â¦ out a
cylinder head while at Nome, but tem
porary repairs were made which enabled
her to steam four knots , an hour. The
schooner Fred E. Sanders was the only
wind Jammer reported damaged. Her
stem was chewed off in the ice.

Mrs. A. M. Allen, rick, suffering and In
filre want, ended her life by taking strych
nine at the home of Mrs. Annie Bwarts,
1C35 De Haro street. Friday night. The
passing of the unfortunate woman marks
the close of the third and final chapter
In a pathetic family tragedy.
Mrs. Allen's only child, a Â«on^ went
down In the Ill-fated City of Chester, Jn
Ban Francisco Bay many years ago, when
that vessel was cut In two by the Oceanic.
Her husband. A. F. Allen. was*murdered
In Napa County three years ago.
Mr. and Mrs. Allen had a comfortable
home in Napa, which they called the Solid
Comfort Home. It was true to Its name,
and they were HvJng happily until Mr. Al
len became addicted to drink. He neglect
ed his business and soon the home was
mortgaged. Allen's business affairs, be-
cause of bis dissipation, w*nt. from bad
to worse, and after, he was killed the
raortjraRe was foreclosed, Mrs.' Allen be
ing at that time a helpless invalid. Bha
drifted about from ono place to . another.
her ailment, a general breaking down of
the system, growing more and more seri
ous. Finally she was admitted to the City
and County Hospital, from which institu
tion she was removed three. weeks ago to
the home of Mrs . Swarts. a .charitable
woman, to whom she was a. total stranger.
And there she died by her own hand.

Â¦President Hays swears that the com
pany Is out of politics and that he In
tends to run the railroad like any com
mercial Institution. Those who are inter
ested in politics claim that Hays cannot
run the road without himself or some of
his representatives having a finger In the
pie. Politicians say that this is the first
handwriting on the wall on the part of
the Nevada Legislature, and that unless a
liberal purse ts judiciously- distributed
among- politicians both here and in Ne
vada, things will be much worse in the
future. . -Â¦ '
A number of California politicians who
have been in the habit of receiving small
courtesies from the Southern Pacific in
the past to "sort of grease the wheels,",
say that, there will be "something doing"
in the next Legislature unless "Hays
changes his present tactics. Others who
admire Hays' stand claim that he is not
a man to be intimidated and that the
first time that he is approached on any
holdup proposition he will make it 'warm
for all parties concerned. â¢ 'Â¦.Â¦-Â¦Â¦
i A. few months ago the Nevada Legisla

founded when served with the notice of
the raise. He did nothing then in the
matter, which was left unattended to for
several weeks. At last it was decided to

an -unjust assessment.. The -ca.se is to

.RUNS AND HITS BY "INNINGS.
The locals trimmed their lamps in the
seventh inning 1 yesterday -afternoon,
straightened out a few of Comedian John
son's twisters and before "Youngey" set
tled" down three of the pretzel shooters
1 had crossed the rubber, and Cal Ewing's
star players were a few points further
away from the coveted pennant. \
It was a 'well played game from start to
finish, -marred by but one error, made by
"Truck" Eagan in the <; initial inning. San
Francisco played a clean, snappy game
and managed to hit the ball when hits
meant runs. The Dudes, on the other
hand, failed to bunch their hits, so here
hangs their tale of woe.
" Each side went out y in something like
one, two, three order until the fourth in
ning, when. the Dudes started in to make
a showing. .Drennan managed to obtain a
free pass to first,- but was caught in try
ing to steal second. Dunleavy came next
and connected with one of Jimmy's pet
curves for a beautiful three-bagger.
Whalen lost his ey<J for just a minute and
hit Strieb, forgetting that the "Dutch
man" was married. . Eagan next sent a
slow one to Schwartz, bringing Dunleavy
in â¢ but going out at first himself. - "Chim
mle der Whale" proved ' too much for,
"Mother" Ix)hman, who ended the good
work by striking out. Oakland lost . her
batting eye after this. inning, securing no
more runs.". ' Â¦ .. --..-.Â¦.
Uncle Henry's' men secured their first
tally in the sixth. Schwartz waÂ« hit by a
pitched ball, took second on Pabst's sin-,
gle and went to. third onKrug's sacrifice.
Nordyke sent a high one to .Strieb, who
accepted it, but Schwartz came home on
the ! throw in. Reilly then took first on
four balls, stole second but died there on
Graham's out to Dunlea\y.- Â¦
San Francisco settled down to work In
the seventh. Whalen got free transporta
tion. Croll bunted but was called out for
interfering with the ball, Pete Lohman
going to sleep in- the meantime and letting
Whalen go to second on a passed ball.
The Germans in this inning took kindly
to Joh-nson's offerings. Hiidebrand tore
off a single, outting Jimmy on , third.
Schwartz also managed to hit safely,
bringing the San Francisco itwirler in.
Pabst . next straightened out one . of
Youngey's kinks for a two-cushion swat,
bringing Schwartz and Hiidebrand in, but
going out at third by trying to stretch it
into a triple. Krug then made an eat;y out,
retiring the side. '. . '...-'â¢;,
Both pitchers were in good trim. "Whalen
held the Dudes down to three hits, . one
of which* was a three-bagger. The Ger
mans, got five safe ones from Johnson,
three of them being secured by Pabst. The,
series -will be decided to-day. One game
will be played at Oakland in the morning
andi the deciding one in this city in the
afternoon. Following is the score: ".

FOR THE STAKE
SAN RAFAEL. July 20.â In one of
the most exciting finishes that
has ever concluded a. paper chase
of the San Rafael Hunt Club,
Frank Glass won the prize for
gentlemen and Miss Annette Bradshaw
that for ladies to-day. The honors of the ;
chase belong to Miss Bradshaw, who
probably would have beaten all competi
tors had not her filly bolted when the
race Jn the straightaway for the finish
Sags 'was on. At that she passed the
flags close to the leader, and her magniri
cent riding won the congratulations of all
observers of the chase.
The riders and their friends gathered in
the grounds of the Hotel Rafael at 3
o'clock, and preparations for the start
were made. Louis Hughes, with two
enormous bags of paper suspended over
his shoulders, dashed away in the capac
ity of "hare" and twenty minutes later
the hotel's dinner gong summoned the
"hounds" to the scratch. Then the voice
of Ward McAllister was heard:
"Gentlemen, are you ready?" Then, as
the riders bunched on the driveway:
"Away, and may the best man win." â¢
And out the riders sped, full twenty of
them, across Petaluma avenue, following
the line of Vjoss papers" left by Hughes.
The course lay to the west, over the Lu
cas ranch, along ridges and through quiet
valleys for about eleven miles. The finish
came on the meadow of the ranch of A.
P. Hotaling, Â¦where two flags were
planted. .
After the paper chasers left, all of the
guests and sightseers drove out to the
Hotalingr ranch-. It â¢was a hot, dusty drive.
Ward McAllister, as master of ceremonies,
headed the procession and maintained
order. Arriving at the grounds the flags
were duly planted and everybody waited.
Soon the Hunt Club riders came into view
on the distant ridge. . Â«r <
Then the excitement began. It was a
beautiful sight. In the steep descent Miss
Bradshawtook the lead. Urging her mount
to reckless speed down the slippery hill,
her daring ride gave her a 200-yard lead of
the'entire party. This advantage she lost,
however, on reaching the level,: as her
thoroughbred filly bolted from the paper
strewn trail and the others thundered on
past her. As the riders came to the lin<i
between the flags, Miss Bradshaw dashed
In with the leaders. "After crossing the
line her filly collided with the horse i ld- 
den by Graham Babcock. and the young
lady was thrown across Babcock's horse,
with her foot caught in her. own stirrup.
Mr. Babcock caught her," as did Judge
Martinelli, who ran to her assistance. It
was a miraculous escape. â¢ - Mrs.-- Farns
worth, who rode with Miss Bradshaw,
came in first, but passed outside of tho
flags, not haying entered the chase.
The" flrstTfpur- to finish- â¢were: -^ Frank
Glass, Grahlsn Babcock,: Miss Bradshaw
and Miss Jeuries.

Notes of the Camp.
Residents of Napa., were startled at an early
hour this morning by hearing a band playing
lively music. The sound of brass instruments
in the early hours made it impossible for peo
ple to sleep in camp or elsewhere. It appears
that the band, under the leadership of Austin
Morris, stole out of camp with Its instruments
and took up a position in the vicinity of the
graveyard and then played "A Hot Old Time"
and similar music. A provost guard was sent
out for the musicians, but the latter were too
wary. They retreated to another spot and
again rendered sweet music. The happy musi
cians continued playing on every side of camp
for an hour. When captured by the guard
they were taken to the guardhouse.
Captain Frank McCarthy of Company D re
turned to camp this morning. His entire com
pany met him at the depot and escorted him.
Jack Donohue, regimental inspector, and
Xash Dwyer, formerly captain of Company D,
have been in camp for the past three days.
Musician Rellly ate at a downtown rotis
serie a few nights back and soup was served
to him en tasse. Reilly believed it was tea
and proceeded to administer milk and sugar.
When he discovered his error he was wroth.
Colonel McGloin was the victim of a Joke
to-day. McGloin returned from a - trip down
town and found a cow contentedly munching
straw in his tepee. The cow had the colonel's
leggings on her front feet and his hat rested
Jauntily on the animal's horns. A few other
decorations were add?d that gave the cow
an aoDearance that was startling in the ex
treme.
Sergeant -Walter O'Connor keeps his tent

the boys can't sympathize with him.

A.- R. Fouratt of Company A was captured
by a band of Indians led by Chief Doling:.
Fouratt was tied to a stake and . after being
properly blackened was left there to be gazed
at by visitors in camp.
Dr. Glannini arrived In camp this morning
and in company with Dr. Morrlsey proceeded
to add more pains to the unfortunate cadets
who were compelled to seek their aid.
Captain James Toohey of Company G was
officer of the dajfc-and Lieutenant Johnson was
officer of the guard. â¢
Company D is the largest In camp. " There
are forty-eight members here. Last night all
but three spent the night in the guardhouse.
The trio were on guard, otherwise they would
have been among those "Jugged.",
Captain Frank Fontaine, an executive offi
cer of the regiment and Company CKs advisor
in matters. military, arrived in camp to-day.

this city for Victoria and Westminster. At
the latter place the cousins made large in
vestments in land. They returned to San
Francisco the same year, and Charles
Sutro once more engaged in the exchange
and banking business. He had been bred
to it and understood It thoroughly. He at
once attracted a large clientele, and in
a cosmopolitan city such as this is his
mastery of languages stood him in good
stead.
Charles Sutro. although of foreign birth,
was a patriot and at the beginning of the
Civil War headed the subscription list for

CALL HEADQUARTERS. CAMP
POWER. NAPA, July 20.â The
last night in camp -will be a mem
orable one in the annals of the
First Regiment, League of the
Cross Cadets. Never before was
there such goodVnatured, rollicking sport.
Every member of the organization en
camped here believed it was his duty to
add to the merriment. The band marched
through camp, playing outlandish music.
Every company street had its entertain
ment and the hundreds of visitors were
treated to novel amusements. Companies
vied with one another in decorating "their
tents and streets. Chinese lanterns, bunt
ing, flags and gaudy colors were used and
the effect was striking.
No one attempted to sleep. Throughout
the night discordant sounds and revelry
kept every cadet awake. The camp
I guards had a busy time quelling the
noise, but their efforts were useless. The
guardhouse was filled to overflowing, but
this did not stop the fun.
Early in the evening an entertainment
was given at headquarters. Major Duffey
had charge of the programme. Refresh
ments were served to the guests of the
officers. Lieutenant John O'Brien ren
dered a tenor solo, Dave Torres per
formed on the banjo; Armand Putz, the
leader of the band, played a cornet solo;
Wiliard Slcane sang some sweet melodies,
as did George F. Keane, and camp come
1 dians told of experiences of the week.
I Short speeches were made by Colonel Mc-
Gloln, Father O'Ryan and other s.,
Andy Z. Gaughran succeeded in captur
ing Camp Power, despite the resistance
of Major Duffey's command. While the
! sham battle was not as exciting as, the
one on Wednesday, it was extremely in
teresting. The -defenders of the camp
used the cannon and buckets of water to
beat back the besiegers. During a hot
battle around the flagpole, Gaughran and
a portion of his command rushed through
the gate and claimed possession of the
camp. . '
; To-morrow at 3 o'clock the regiment
will leave by special train and it will ar
rive in San Francisco at 6:30 p. m. . It is
expected that hundreds of persons- will
come to Napa on excursion trains to ge,t
a view of the encampment before It
passes into history. The ceremony of
breaking camp will be watched with deep
interest by the visitors. The cadets will
prepare .for departure during the morning
hours. At 2 o'clock the bugler on duty
at headquarters will blow the "general."
At a signal from the gun the cadets will
drop their tents. This* is an extremely
pretty sight. The tents are dropped to
ward headquarters and -within a few mo
ments the field is covered by hundreds of
cadets, who strive to beat one another
tving up the canvas homes.
To-morrow morning the regiment will
attend military mass at St. John's
Church. Rev. Father- O'Ryan will be
chaplain. Rev. Father Slattery, pastor
of the church, Ib highly pleased with the
conduct of the regiment and he probably
will express his gratification. â¢

STOBY-OF THE LIFE
OF A GREAT BANKE3
Charles Sutro, who died in this city on
Friday, was born at Alx-la-Chapelle, on
January 27, 1828. He received his educa
tion in that city, being a most studious
youth, and at 16 years of ago spoke Ger
man, French, English, Spanish and Dutch.
He entered the banking house of his
father at Alx^la-Chapelle in the early
part of the last century, subsequently
visiting the principal financial centers of
Europe and remaining- for a long season at
Frankfort-on-Maln, in those . days the
great financial center of the world. Con
ceiving, at that time, a desire to see the
New World, he came to America with his
brother Albert. After visiting most of the
States, he concluded ' to see California
also and reached San Francisco in the
summer of 1852. He became manager of
a leading mercantile establishment of the
time shortly after arriving here and also
engaged in private banking and in several
successful business .operations at the
mines.
He accumulated considerable wealth tÂ»y
these means, and at the time of the Fra
zer River excitement, In company with his

' CONCEBT AT PAVILION
Frogramme Rendered, in Presence of
Largest Audience Ever Gathered
; : in City.
The second ,<?rand concert of the conven
tion took place last night at the Pavilion
before as large and friendly an audience
as on the first occasion. Every seat was
filled, and the concert In many important
respects was an even greater success
than on its first giving. The Tuesday pro
gramme was repeated, with some changes
in the solo numbers, but the choice of
Saturday night for the concert was rather
unfortunate in Its effect on the chorus,
which was very considerably smaller tnan
at the first concert. What was lost in
volume was perhaps gained in accuracy,
however the ensemble being distinctly
better than it was with the larger chorus,
though this was largely, owing to the
really phenomenal work of W. B. King at
the organ, by which the imperfections or
the instrument as it is now placed were
quite obviated. Chcir and organ were ex
actly together, and tbe choruses went
with a noble swine: and air. VV. F. Skeele
nlaved the prelude and finale from Con
cert Piece in O" (Guilmant) and "Vaiia
tlons on a Scotch Air," of Dudley Buck s,
in addition to nis numbers of 1 uesday,
and was heartily applauded. The Park
sisters cornetists, received their usual
ovation, and Miss Anna Park, substituting
for the Juanlta Club, played "Columbia,^

A general tie-up of the wholesale and
retail trade of this city may develop to
morrow, unless the Draymen's Associa
tion and the Brotherhood of Teamsters
come to some agreement. Efforts toward
the accomplishment of such a result will
be attempted to-day, but the prospect of
an agreement Is not very bright. -
When the announcement was made that
the Morton Special Delivery Company had
been boycotted by the San Francisco La
bor Council, and that its affiliated' branch,
the Morton Drayage and Warehouse Com
pany, was incidentally concerned in the
matter, the Draymen's Association noti
fied the men employed by Its members
that they would be expected to live up
to the agreement made some six months
ago.
At that time a schedule of wages was
adopted and hours of labor fixed. These
remained in force until the influx of
Eastern visitors with a myriad of pack
ages, valises and trunks. The climax
came when members of the Brother
hood of Teamsters refused to , han
dle any baggage consigned to the
boycotted firm or those who ' were
assisting it. The details of the contro
versy were difficult of adjustment;
Extraneous matter cropped up during
the controversy, and the Draymen's As
sociation determined to end the matter in
the shortest time possible.
As the men left or returned to the barns
yesterday they were notified that unless
they complied -with the agreement made
at that time they must Quit their jobs.
About 1000 men were reached during the
day, and the balance, approximately 500,
will be notified as soon as possible.
Secretary George Renner of the Dray
men's Association said last night: .
Fight to the Finish.
"We have notified about 1000 employes
of the various firms that are included in
the agreement we made some time ago
that they must obey our instructions or
quit our employ. We gave the teamsters
all they asked for, and intend to see that
they get it. But we do not propose to be
dictated to by any body of men. We in
tend to stand firm, and if these people are
carried away by a single idea we propose
to discipline them. The employer must
run his business and not be subject to
anybody's whims or inclinations. ' Our
light is a fight to the finish."
As a result of this determined stand
matters are in a chaotic state. Under the
resolution declaring a boycott against the
Morton Special Delivery Company a large
number of union men employed in. whole
sale and retail establishments will have
to refuse to deliver any goods that may
be consigned to the company for delivery.
A large number of unions, directly and
indirectly connected with the delivery
business, are involved. Just what the out
come may be will depend upon the con
ferences to be held to-day. If the- Broth
erhood of Teamsters insists on its boy
cott it may result in serious consequences
to the city. Tljese questions were discussed
at a meeting of the Brotherhood of Team
sters held last night at 672 Fourth street,
but as no conclusion was reached at,mid
night, it was determined to hold a meet
ing An a larger hall, some time to-day.
So grave did the situation appear yes
terday afternoon that Chief of Police Sul
livan was called into conference. He said
that he would provide all the men he
possibly could, but would be compelled to
ask for additional assistance. He pro
posed to go before the Board of Supervi
sors to-morrow and ask for authority to
employ additional men. to be sworn in
either as regular or special officers, to
prevent any possible disturbance which
the members of. the Draymen's Associa
tion seem to fear.
Sympathetic Strike Expected.
A sympathetic strike of the , porters,
packers and warehousemen, men employ
ed alongshore and others who3e duties
bring them in contact with the teamsters
and draymen is expected. Efforts are be
ing made on the part of the employers,
composing the greater portion of the
wholesale and retail districts, to avert
any extended tie-up of business.
The Brotherhood of Teamsters last
night issued the following statement:
We desire to place ourselves in a right light
before the public, as -we arc not on a strike,
nor do we intend to so , on strike. But we
are locked out by the Draymen's Association,
under the orders of the Manufacturers' and
Employers' Association. We allow men driv
ing for firms ownlne- their own teams -to
work as long as they do not interfere in out
gide hauling-. We intend to hold a special
meeting this morning at the Turk-street Tem
ple to discuss the situation* and instruct the
drivers as to what course to pursue.
According to Manager Vining of the
Market Street Railway system full infor
mation of. the actions of the men em
ployed by the company regarding the for
mation of a union was conveyed to head
quarters some time ago. He confirms trie
statement that the men who were dis
charged were leaders^ in a movement ' to
unionize the system, and while admitting
that the number of men named in The
Call were discharged, would not admit
that it was because of their desire to form
a union. He was not disposed to discuss
the situation. â¢ -
The Car Employes' Union has sent an
ultimatum to the managers of the road
which takes the . form of the usual de
mand for Increased pay and Â¦ shorter
hours. Two weeks was given the com
pany for compliance with the demands.
This time will expire within a few days.
In the meanwhile some of its trusted
secret service employes have been called
to the city and are now enjoying rides to
the scenic points of the city with a view
of determining juat what the situation
may be. Some of these men may, oe
called upon to see that, In the event of a
strike, the mail cars go through on time.
"Union. Labor Party.
The following address has been issued
by the executive committee of the Union
Labor party:.- â¢ - '
The executive' committee of the Union Labor
party desires to inform the voters of organized
labor that they are not , actuated by any in
structions received or given by the Saif Fran
cisco Labor Council, or yet is the San Fran
cisco Labor Council responsible for the calling
together of members of organized labor for the
purpose of calling a convention for the nom
ination of . a full and complete municipal
ticket to be voted for at the next coming elec
tion in November. E Such action as Is now be
ing j taken by members of organized labor is
actuated by principles they believe: to be only
fair, equitable and just to all organized labor.
That in the past they have rendered valuable
assistance to the. two great parties in the cast

as a mark of gratitude in this their great hour
of trial when labor naturally expected a, sym

find that their, appeals and supplications were

failed."
James <3. Fair's last expression of his
desire that the bulk or" his fortune should
pass to the children of. his children has
been blotted out of his will by Judge
James M. Troutt. The last testament of
the dead millionaire now stands on the
records of the court useless in Its intended
purpose, sircply conveying to the world
the wishes of James G. Fair, which
would, have been honored had it not befen
for law. /Â¦
A few weeks ago the Supreme Court
adjudged the trust clause in the will of
the deceased Invalid so far as the realty
was concerned, holding that as the fee
to Fair's property was cast In the trus
tees to transfer and convey to certain
Â¦Â»f tis kindred, such a trust being unau
thorized by the statute, the same must
fall, la the same decision the Supreme
Court declared that the Invalid trust to
convey carried with it the otherwise valid
trust for the lives of the testator's chil
dren, and that "therefore the whole trust
But the trustees and their attorneys
construed this opinion and the sentence,
"theretore the whole trust failed," to
refer solely to the trust relating to the
real property of the estate. The trust un
der which the trustees held personal
property valued at J7.000.000. they urged,
was not affected by the decision and tnat
sufficient of the will remained intact to
establish the intention of the testator re
garding the personalty. Hence they con
tend it should stand.
Trustees Befuse to Surrender.
But Theresa A. Oelrichs, Virginia Van
derbilt and Charles L. Fair wanted tnis
J7.000.000 worth of personal property. Un-
der the provisions of the trust clause
James S. Angus, T. G. Crothers and W.
S. Goodfellow, the trustees, wÂ«fre to have
â¢ and to hold this property during the lives
of the children and then to convey to the
Â¦children or descendants of Theresa A-
Oelrichs one-fourth of the trust property,
one-fourth to the children of Virginia
Vanderbllt and the remaining half of the
estate in equal shares to the brothers and
sisters and to the children of any de
ceased brother or sister by right of rep
resentation.
Under the direction of Jheir counsel the
children opened the fight to destroy this
trust. The action came up before Judge
Troutt on a petition for partial distribu
tion filed by the children on April 23. 1897.
This petition was decided yesterday, the
children won their point and now the en
tire will is a nullity.
After reviewing the case and weighing
the various authorities cited, Judge
Troutt says:
All Trust Clauses Fall.
It Is my conclusion that a proper construc
tion of the trcst provisions in question re
quire me to declare that all of them necessar
ily fall together: and that, consequently, the
petition of decedent's children for the distri
bution of certain personal property to them
eelves should be granted, except as to thÂ«
sum of $100,000. which will be reserved as a
.fund out of which the executors' counsel may
be compensated and. except also as to the
specific personal pronÂ«rty that counsel for the
various parties have stipulated should be re
served, being of a value exceeding 12,000,000.
This reserved property, "being of a
value exceeding: $2,000,000." was withheld
from distribution by the court ,in recog
nition of Mrs. Nettie B. Craven's as
rurnecj right to another attempt to estab
lish heirship as the alleged widow of the
rfeeeased. This matter will come up in
the near future, and as her counsel re
marked: "In view of the fact that new
evideiice in her favor has been discovered
end as we shall cut in all of the old evi
dence the hearing- of the case will occupy
S-bout four months."

The manufacturers claim to be well sat
isfied with the developments of the week,
as there are still in operation the non
union mills at Vandergrift, Chester. Dun
cansville. Old Meadow. Saltsburg and;
Scottdale and the tin plate at Mone3sen.
All these mills, they say, have a larga
capacity and are running full. They also
express gratification at the partial* start
made at Wellsville and the' promise of a
larger force on Monday.
"An important announcement was madu
at the National Steel Company's mills at
Mlng-o Junction this evening-, based on
an order from the Carnegie Company, to
the, effect that the future wages of all
employes, including laborers, will be
raised to that paid In the Carnegie mills."
It was â¢ stated to-night in McKeesport
that the organization of rolling mill men.
of the National Tube Company had been
completed to-day and that twenty-eight
men had signed the agreement to Join
the association. The association officials
would not confirm the report. A telegram;
from- Steubenville, Ohio, to-night says:
Increase Made In Wages.
The only thing which will start the mill wilH
be the taking: back of the old men, and as Ions
as the men are out the mill cannot be started.
There are not enough men In the country to
start the Woods mill, and there la not now suf
ficient time to make men to put the plant in,
operation next Monday. Organized labor is
bound to win, but remember, men. & peaceable,
and bloodMsa victory is the best and most hon
orable victory. I would not advise the saloons
to be closed during the present trouble, because
proprietors of such places nave paid a Ilcensa
to operate them. I advise you, however, to bs
careful to abstain from intoxicating beveragea
to excess, to observe the law and commit no act
of violence.
Representatives of the American Sheet Steel,
Company have repeatedly told me that if tha
laboring men were all organized the associa
tion would become too strong. I have- never*
spoken of this before. The men are now out.
on strike, and I advise them to stand together.,
Another official told me there ought to be non-*
union mills in order to hold the balance of
power. Men of McKeesport. are you not tired
chewing bones? The trusts have not only
kicked you this time, but are fighting you. ThÂ»
combine has threatened to move the Woods
mill to Vandergrift If the men don't return to
work, but you can rest assured the "Woods mill
will never be moved to Vandergrift or any
other place. The mill officials have implored
the officials of the Amalgamated Association ta
start the plant, as they needed the product. A
report is beint circulated that the mill will
start Monday -with non-union men, but it never
Will be.
The meeting at SIcKeesport was dla*
metrically opposed to the Vandergrift
gathering- in Its object and action. It was*.
held In 'White's Opera-house nuder fhÂ»
auspices of the Amalgamated AssociaÂ«;
tion and was addressed by several of the*
prominent officials of the association,
principal among whom -was President-
Shaffer. The hall was "crowded to ther
doors and much enthusiasm was evl*
denced. In an impassioned speech Presi*
dent Shaffer urged the mill men to stands
up for their union. In the course oÂ£ hi*
talk -he said:

It Can Be Cored by Electricity.
Thousands of men have Varicocele 'and are ignorant of the fact. They only know
that something is draining the vim and ambition from their bodies and brains, and
know of no reason to account for it. This terrible affliction is the most treacherous,
silent and certain in its work of all known ailments. Ij comes on without apparent
cause and never ceases in its destructive influence until it robs a man of all his vitality
, and leaves him a wreck of his normal self.
There are many ways of treating it, but none is so sure of success as properly ap-
plied electricity. * â¢ -~
I have devoted twenty years of my life to the study of this and kindred subjects,
and in this time have cured 5000 cases of Varicocele.

to perfectness and the music by Mrs.
'George L. Darling was as usual, charm
ing. After the work there was a supper
in the banquet hall and a number of those
present made brief addresses.
Mrs. Lizzie Atwood, conductor of Olive
Branch Chapter, and also . grand record
ing secretary of the Companions . of the

- Degree of the Amaranth.
Now that Crescent^ Court No. 3 of the
Degree of the Amaranth has settled In
Masonic quarters in Golden Gate Hall,
it bids fair to equal, if not surpass, its
former record. On the night of the 12th
the officers who have profited by the ex
cellent Instructions imparted by the pres
ent royal matron, Mrs. Mary G. Dunn,
gave an exemplification of the ritualistic
and floor work in a manner that offered
no opportunity for adverse criticism and
creating a most favorable Impression on
the four strangers who were Initiated and
on the members and visitors. The sump
tuousness of the banquet Â¦which â¢was given
in honor of the new members was ample
testimony of the ability of the royal ma
tron and her coterie of ladies and gentle
men on the committee to be first-class
entertainers, nothing having been left un
done to make participants delighted with
the extended hospitality. There were sev
eral supreme officers present and greet
ings from the supreme patron were read.
The court will initiate a large class of can
didates at a meeting in the near future.

At the last held meeting of San Fran
cisco Temple of the Rathbone Sisters a
number of the members related their ex
perience of how they earned a dollar each

stances and brought out the ingenuity of
the members In securing the dollar. Three
applications for membership were pre
sented. The officers of the temple for the
current term were installed by Grand
Chief Ada E. Mergulre on the 18th lnst.

Baldness follows falling: hair, .falling
hair follows dandruff and dandruff is the
result of a germ digging Its way Into the
scalp to the root of the hair, where It saps
the vitality of the hair. To destroy that
germ la to prevent as well as cure dan-
druff, falling hair and, lastly, baldness.
There Is only one preparation known to
do that, Newbro's Herpiclde, an entirely
new scientific discovery.- Wherever It has
been tried It has proven wonderfully suc-
cessful. It can't be otherwise, because it
utterly destroys the dandruff germ. "You
destroy the cause, you remove the effect."

JCTSTF YORK, July 20.â Anxiety over the
Western crop . eituition overbore all other
consideration* la the stock market to-day and
carried price* Sown through the attempts of
the Inside Interests tn certain stocks to sup
port the market. The closing prices were near
the lowest and the market was active and
weak at the last. The only modification of the
weakness was due to the buying to cover and
take profits by the bears, who saw handsome
profit* accrued &Â« a result of the decline late
yesterday and to-day. These bearish opera
tors have been supposed by Wall street to be
resident chiefly !ti the V.'eet and to be con
cerned in bulling -grain as well as bearing
Btocks. The filing gained force In Wall street
to-day that thin double campaign has more
basis in fact than was believed yesterday and
the Western continent received large rein
forcements from Eastern Bources. The sup
porters of the market made headway against
the bears In thÂ« first hour, when vigorous ef
forts were made to drive the bears to cover.
There w* a resuraptJoa of pool operations In
Southern Pacific and that stock as well as St.
Paul and Missouri Paclfle were left well over
last' night. Aggressive soiling- by the bears
Immediately developed, fcased on the reports of
new damage to the corn crop, and reports of

first heeded In Wall etreet. Another attempt
was mad* to rally the market on the strong

Weather Report.
"Trade was a little more active last week,
the cessation of the extremely hot weather
apparently having a somewhat stimulating
effect. There was 2iot much actual business in
a large way, however, although there was
more inquiry for round lots. This, together
with the fact that the eises of orders ranged
a little larger, caused a rather more hopeful
feeling on the part or local holders.
"Stocks of currants were increased by the
arrival, rather unexpectedly, of the Marco
Minghettl with 110 barre-ls from Patras, the
Â«ntlre shipment coming to the leading holder
here. The Tocahontas, now due from Patras,
brings about 750 barrels. The two largest local
holders will get practically all of those goods.
It Is understood. The market at the cloee
Saturday was steady at unchanged quotations,
with demand moderate. Raisins were quiet.
There was a little trade In impcrted Sultanas
and Valencias and in domestic layers. Spot
apricots met with a rather better sale and
there was a fair demand for prunes and prime
apples."

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
United States refunding 2s. the 4s and the.
old 4s advanced 14 and the new 4s 14 per cent
below the last closing call of last week..
The speculative contingent rests great con
fidence on the assumption that organized ar
rangements in force, backed by the principal
capitalistic groups, to support the market, un
der the direction of the most forceful and suc
cessful market -leader and operator of ths day.
Railroad bonds have moved In sympathy with
but less widely than stocks.
Money market conditions have been- easier
this week: The disposition of bankers, how
ever, is still toward rather cautious conserva
tion of resources for the requirements of the
crop movement.
This week opened with a deluge of liquida
tion of stocks, induced by the unlooked for rup
ture of negotiations and calling of a strike by
the members of the Amalgamated Association.
The shutting down of some of the anthracite
mines on account of a firemen's strike was
also a depressing factor. Coming on top of
last week's severe declines and the resulting
losses and impairment of margins and re
sources, serious consequences were threatened
by this renewed demoralization In the stock
market. The realization of this was apparent
in the effective measures taken to support the
market by the two dominant groups of capital
ists, whose quarrel precipitated the Northern
Pacific corner and the May panic. The mere
fact, which was made patent to the specula
tive public, that these two powers were united
In support of the market afforded Immense re
lief to sentiment. The acute depression of the
week before was principally due to the evi
dence of selling on behalf of one of the Inter
ests of various stocks and to the fear to which
this gave rise that the Northern Pacific quar
rel had broken out afresh. It was evident that
no vague intimations and assurances that all
was harmony would avail to quiet the dis
turbance caused by this fear. The decisive
6tep was therefore determined upon of an
nouncing the new harmony board of directors
for Northern Pacific. This step was admitted
ly taken with a view to stock market 1 exigen
cies, and to lessen the pressure of liquidation
which was proving detrimental to many Im
portant financial projects, -and depressing
prices to a level felt to be unwarranted by the
promise of the future of sustained and in
creasing earning power. Early knowledge of
the coming announcement was clearly appar
ent In the enormous buying throughout the list
by insiders on Wednesday, although it was not
until Just before the close that the announce
ment was given to the public. One. of the de
trimental effects of the slump in American
stocks was its unsettling effect on the London
market, where a fortnightly settlement was
In progress. It is. a striking example of the
new importance and influence of - American
financial affairs that a decline in the shares of
an Industrial corporation In New York should
result In a drop in British consols to the low
est price In a decade. The Immediate explan
ation is found in the - fact that the course of
United States Steel stocks aroused distrust
among London bankers, and money was diffi
cult to secure for the carrying over of those
stocks. In fact; American securities, as a
whole, were somewhat- affected, so that even
discount rates hardened during the pendency
of the settlement. Heavy blocks of the Steel
stocks have been placed abroad as the result
of the recent foreign visit of the foremost cap
italist In the corporation syndicate, but they
came back in a stream this week as a result
of the strike. The drop in consols was sup
posed to be due to large offerings by the Amer
ican syndicate, which, it will be remembered,
received a liberal allotment of the last Issue.
This operation was naturally resorted ' to as a
set-off In the International exchange market
to the selling In New York by British holders
of American securities. The impression pro
duced on the London market, which led to
something resembling a public remonstrance
from Lord Rothschild on Monday, was doubt
less an additional movement toward the ac
tion taken to support the market and check
the decline. It made it evident, also, that a
part of the heavy liquidation of last week was
due to preparation for supporting the market,
which it was foreseen would bo necessary this
week.
the tmlls were obliged to desist and prices fell
by rapid stages practically up to the close. St.
Paul fell under 4 last night. Rock Island 4%.
Northwestern 8. Atchlson 3%. tha preferred 2%
and others of the Pacific and Southwestern
groups as well as leading Southern and Trunk
line railroads and specialties from 1 to 2
points. Some of the less prominent stocks
showed large losses. The Steel stocks were
largely dealt In, but moved narrowly, and were
supported, the common losing only 14 and the
preferred closing H higher. \

STOCK AND BOND EXCHANGE.
CHICAGO, July 20.â The story of corn -was a
story that could have been told of any session
during the past fortnight, j There was the same
uncompromising weather map and the same
general demand from the afflicted districts for
corn to replace -that which the elements have
burned. Messages from the great corn-raising
zone were of one tenorâ there was scarcely a
cheerful note -in them. Local people fearing
that a rain to-morrow might upset the calcu
lations pold on a liberal scale, but the buying
'by people who need the corn continued stead
ily and the close found the bull position still
secure. SeDtember sold between 54%c and
55%c and closed 1%@1%c higher" at 55@55%c.
Oats also continued to advance. The demand
was a heavy one. September close** %c higher
at 35>ic. '
Traiie in wheat Â¦was comparatively quiet.
September opened %c to %c higher at 69%c to
69%c in sympathy with corn. For a time the
market held above 69c under additional sus
taining factors in the shape of scattered dam
age claims. There was. however." a big long
interest still bearing in mind the fact that
the wheat Â¦ crop i- bids .â¢ fair to be a. record
breaker, and under persistent liquidation from
â¢this quarter SeDtember worked down to 68%c
and closed easy, -%@%c lower at 68%@68%c.
' Provisions were extremely dull and a trifle
easier. September pork closed 7%c j lower, lard
and ribs 2%c depressed.

CLOSING.
NEW YORK, July 20.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Attendance on \ the' floor of the Stock . Ex
change was small and stocks were lifeless to
day. The American department was unset
tled and a few additional clearance sales, fol
lowing- the recent embarrassments of small
operators, sent prices -below parity. These
over, the tone hardened. Atchlson, Union Pa
cific and Southern Pacific were the best "feat
ures, but the fluctuations had no significance.
London Market.
NEW YORK",~July 20.â The statement of the
Associated Banks for the week ending to-day
shows: Loans, $S56,19S,500; decrease, $12,268,900.
Deposits, $939,145,300; decrease, $8,4iS,800. Cir
culation, ' $30,710,100; Increase, $S0.6C0. Legal
tenders, $78,616,900; increase, $918,700. Specie,
$177,501,800; Increase, $5,189,100. Reserves, $255,
816,700; Increase, $6,107,800. Reserve required,
$234,786,325 ;. decrease, $2,112,200. Surplus, $21,
029.375; increase, $8,220,000.
The Financier says: The statement of the
New York Associated Banks last Saturday
shewd from the borrowers' standpoint of view
the very gratifying increase in surplus reserve
of $8,220)000, carrying this item to $21,029,373,
or very close to the figures recorded at the
beginning of June. The present position of the
banks in t.'iis respect is such as to relieve ap
prehensions on their part of being seriously
incommoded through a withdrawal by their
correspondents of cash to an extent sufficient
to place restrictions in loaning in order - to
maintain their percentage of reserves. The in
stitutions, as a whole,, loaned less freely- than
usual because of the lighter demand for money,
and this fact will In great part account for
the- reduction of this item. The gain of $6,107,-
S00 in cash was slightly below the amount
shown by the preliminary estimates. The in
crease of $5,189,100 in epecie largely reflects
Sub-Treasury operations. The decrease of $8,
448,800 in deposits is out of harmony with the
other items. From present indications the
banks will continue to gain in cash througli
Sub-Treasury operations and receipts of gold
from the Pacific Coast assay offices, there be
ing about $1,500,000 of the latter which will
probably, arrive during the coming week. A
movement last week of $200,000 currency by
transfer through the Treasury to Chicago and
of $100,000 to New. Orleans evidently, for the
purpose of securing denominations of currency
which were deficient at the points named and
did not indicate a beginning of the crop move
ment, as surmised In many quarters. The out
look for the present favors easy money, but
present institutions In the West report a steady
demand on the part of their country corre
spondents for funds. This, no doubt, will : be
reflected soon at Eastern centers, but the. trend
Just now is in this direction.. At Â¦ any rate,
the banks have, recouped rapidly In reserves
and are in a strong position to meet the de
mands which may be made on them later..

"The absurdity of such reasoning can
l>e easily shown. The law creating the of
fice of City Recorder says 'the Recorder
phall be Judge of the Recorder's Oburt
and ehall have the powers and perform
the duties of a magistrate.' Let us see
who are Magistrates under the law and
rwhat the duties of a Magistrate are.- The
Penal Code, section 807. says: 'A Magis
trate, is an officer having power to issue
a warrant for*the arrest of . a person
charged with a public offense.' Section
R>8 says that the following -persons are

A well-known attorney was asked for
his opinion last evening as to. whether it
was possible for this portion of the deci
sion to be construed as giving the full
powers of a Justice of the Peace to a City
Recorder.
"I don't see how it can be done," hÂ« said.
"The decision says clearly that the Re
corder has the right to act as a Justice
of the Peace only as to certain criminal
matters. Now. a Justice of the Peace is
authorized â¢ to solemnize marriages. This
authority is given by special enactment of
the Legislature. It is absurd to say that
because the Supreme Court has decided
that a City Recorder can be looked upon
as a Justice of the Peace In certain crim
inal, actions he is therefore empow
ered to do all that a Justice of the Peace
is authorized to do.
Recorder's Claims Are Absurd.
. City JU>>corder Murray of San Rafael
claimed on Friday that a decision of the
Supreme Court gave to his office, not only
the full power of a Police Judge, but also
of a Justice of the Peaice. The decision
mentioned by Murray is that In the Cali
fornia Reports, SS, page 417, in the case of
Dante R. Prince vs. the City of Fresno.
Prince wa* City Recorder of Fresno and
liad collected fines In cases where the city
ordinances and State laws had been vio
lated. He claimed that the fees collected
by him in cases where State laws had
been violated belonged to him, as he was
a Justice of the Peace, and- the City of
Fresno brought suit to compel Prince to
pay the money into the county treasury.
The portion of the decision of the Su
preme Court on which Recorder Murray
and others base their claim, to be consid
ered Justices of. the Peace is as follows:
A city Recorder possesses' the right to act as
a Justice of the Peace, and is. to all intents
and purposes, a Justice of the Peace as to all
criminal matters coining before him under the
Penal Code, as distinct from city ordinances,
and when acting under that code he has au
thority to charge the county ar.d , receive for
his sen-ices such fees as are allowed by law to
Justices of thÂ« Peace in a township of a county
for like sen-ices.
Claims Power of a Justice.
A prominent attorney said yesterday
Xhat for many years claims have been
made by City Recorders that they were
in -fact Justices of the Peace and conse
quently were authorized to solemnize mar
riages. Judge St. Sure, formerly City Rec
order of Alameda, was asked yesterday if
he" had ever performed" any marriage cere*
monies. He said:
-'During the time I was City Recorder
of Alameda I solemnized a few marriages.
I know that my predecessors in office had
always done so and that it has been the
prsfctice with City Recorders in other
cities to officiate at marriages. I have
always been of opinion tnat the law creat
ing the office of City Recorder clothed the
holder with the same powers as possessed
by a Justice of the Peace. A Justice ot
the Peafce is one of the officials designated
to perform the marriage ceremony and
I believed that a Recorder had: that
right."
Opinions by Attorneys. Â¦ .
Attorney Garret McEnerney was asked
lor his opinion on Friday as to the right
of a City Recorder to officiate, at a mar
riage, and the distinguished legal practi
tioner, after 'an examination of the laws
of the State, said he did not think a Re
corder possessed any such power. . \
At the office of Attorney E. S. Pillsbury
it was learned from his associate, Mr.
Madison, that the laws of California were
clear on the subject. In the opinion of
Mr. Madison only those officials desig
nated to perform the marriage ceremony
could do so, and that no construction of
Jaw or decisions could clothe a City Re
corder with the full powers of a Police
Judge or a Justice of the Peace.
The contention of J. J. Murray. City Re
corder of San Rafael, who is one of those
engaged in the business of marrying lov
ing couples, is that he is ex-offleio Police
Judge of San Rafael and that he officiates
,at marriages in that capacity and not as
City Recorder.
Two important questions thus arise for
decision by the Supreme Court of the
State. â¢ In the face of that section of the
Civil Code. designating the officials who
uhall solemnise marriages, are City Re
corders empowered to do so by. any con
struing of decisions of the Supreme
Court?
Duties of Becorder Defined.
The municipal corporation act of 1883,
In creating cities of the fifth and sixth
classes also provided for Recorders'
Courts and Recorders . to preside therein.
.Section &06 of article 6 of the law says:
A Recorder's Court is hereby established â¢ in
cuch city, to be held by the Recorder of such
cfty.
Said Recorder'* Court shall have jurisdiction,
concurrently with the Justices' Courts, or all
actions and proceedings, civil and criminal,
arising within the corporate limits of such city,
and which miyht be tried in euch Justices'
Court: and shall have exclusive jurisdiction of
Â£.11 actions for the recovery of any fine, penalty,
or forfeiture prescribed for the breach of any
ordinance of euch city, of all actions founded
upon any obligations or liability created by any
ordinance, and of all prosecutions for any vio
lation of any ordinance. The rules' of practice
snd mode of proceeding in "said Recorder's
Court shall be the same as are or may be pre
scribed by law in Justices' Courts in like
cases: and appeals may be taken to the Supe
rior Court of the county in which said city may
be situated, from all judgments of said Re
corder's Court, In like manner and with like
effect as in cases of appeals from Justices'
Courts.
Section 8C7â The Recorder shall be Judge of
the Recorder'* Court, and shall have the pow
ers and perform the duties of a magistrate. He
rnay administer end certify oaths and atfirma
tione, and take and certify acknowledgments.
He Fhall be entitled to charge and receive for
his services such fees as are or may be allowed
by law to Justices of the Peace for like serv
ices, except that for his services in criminal
prosecution for violation of ordinance he shall
be entitled to receive only such monthly sal
ary as the Board of Trustees shall, by ordi
nance, prescribe.
The exclusive news published in The
Call yesterday that thirty illegal mar
riages had been performed in the clty v of
San Rafael by the present Recorder and
his predecessor within the last thirty
months has caused a veritable sensation.
Members of the legal profession in this
city are especially interested in the sub
ject, . which was a topic of considerable
discussion yesterday.
In the course of investigation as to the
power of a City Recorder to solemnize
marriages it was learned that official^ of
that class throughout the State . have ! for
years officiated at nuptials, in consequencÂ«
of which there are perhaps thousands of
couples living together in unlawful rela
tionship, innocently believing that in be
ing married by a City Recorder they have
fully complied with the law.
